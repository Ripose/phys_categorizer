Abstract

We describe a free-electron laser (FEL) in the Self Ampliﬁed Spontaneous Emission (SASE)

regime quantizing the electron motion and taking into account propagation eﬀects. We demonstrate

quantum puriﬁcation of the SASE spectrum, i.e., in a properly deﬁned quantum regime the spiking

behavior disappears and the SASE power spectrum becomes very narrow.

The Self Ampliﬁed Spontaneous emission (SASE) regime for a free-electron laser (FEL) is

made up of three basic ingredients: high-gain, propagation or “slippage” eﬀects and start-up

from noise [1]. The classical steady-state high-gain regime of FELs, with universal scaling

and the introduction of the ρ-BPN parameter, was analysed in ref.[2], where the possibility

of operating an FEL in the SASE regime was described. The ﬁrst experimental observation

of the high-gain regime, also starting from noise, was carried out in the microwave range

using a waveguide in the Livermore experiment [3]. Presently, short wavelength FELs which

amplify incoherent shot noise via SASE are of great interest worldwide as potential sources

of ultra bright coherent X-ray radiation [4, 5].

Many theoretical studies of high-gain FELs [6] do not take into account propagation

eﬀects and the initial noise is described by a small input signal or a small bunching. Other

treatments assume that SASE is just steady-state ampliﬁcation starting from noise, ignoring

propagation eﬀects [7, 8]. That approach does not give the correct temporal structure and

spectrum of the SASE radiation as described in ref. [1].

In ref. [9, 10] it was shown that due to propagation there exists not only the steady-state

instability of ref.

[2], but also a superradiant instability, with peak intensity proportional

to n2, where n is the electron density. This instability originates in the region near the

rear edge of the electron bunch, producing a soliton-like pulse which grows and narrows

as it slips over the electrons, preserving a hyperbolic secant shape with some ringing [11].

We stress that the mathematics and the physics of this superradiant instability, which is

at the heart of SASE [1], is completely diﬀerent from the usual steady-state instability. A

striking example of the diﬀerence between the steady-state and superradiant regimes is that

superradiantly ampliﬁed spikes occur when the system is detuned from resonance, whereas

the steady-state instability does not occur [9, 10]. In this case, the superradiant instability

is actually stronger than for the case of exact resonance, since the radiation pulse propagates

over fresh electrons, which have not been perturbed by the steady-state instability.

As shown in ref.

[1], a SASE FEL radiates a random series of spikes since, roughly

speaking, the electron bunch contains many cooperation lengths Lc which radiate randomly

and independently from one another. The ﬁnal result is an almost chaotic temporal pulse

structure with a broad spectral width. The number of spikes in the high-gain regime cor-

responds approximately to the number of cooperation lengths in the electron bunch. Only

when the length of the electron bunch is a few cooperation lengths is a partial “cleaning”

2

of the temporal proﬁle of the radiation obtained, as described in ref.

[1]. Furthermore,

the total radiated energy does not behave as that predicted by steady-state theory. After

reaching the steady-state value of saturation, the energy for SASE continues to increase due

to the fact that the superradiant spikes do not saturate. However, SASE has one drawback

with regard to its application as a useful source of short-wavelength coherent light : at

short wavelengths many cooperation lengths Lc lie within the electron bunch. This implies

a quasi-chaotic temporal structure of the radiation pulse and a consequent wide spectrum.

Several schemes have been proposed in order to avoid the large spectral width associated

with classical SASE. One of these involves a multiple wiggler scheme with a coherent seed

laser [12, 13]. This method is based on the fact that the FEL interaction creates a strong

bunching not only on the fundamental but also on the higher harmonics (even and odd), as

shown analytically in [12, 14]. Hence, if the electron beam is injected in a second wiggler

tuned to one of the higher harmonics, even or odd, the system starts radiating with intensity

n2. This superradiant harmonic generation (SRHG) eventually evolves into the high-gain

∝
exponential regime. A diﬃculty in producing SRHG is that “it is necessary to make the

ﬁrst wiggler section long enough to bring the harmonic bunching well above noise, but not

so long as to induce too much energy spread” [13]. This optimization of SRHG, termed

high-gain harmonic generation (HGHG), has recently been performed by other authors [15].

However, this method presents diﬃculties when going to very short wavelengths, as pointed

out in ref.

[16], due to the fact that each stage ampliﬁes not only the coherent signal but

also the noise.

In this letter we propose a novel method for producing coherent short wavelength radia-

tion with SASE. We introduce a quantum description of SASE which depends on a dimen-

sionless quantum FEL parameter, ¯ρ, which determines the number of photons per electron

and/or the electron recoil in units of the photon momentum. We show that when ¯ρ

1 the

≫

SASE FEL behaves classically, i.e. in agreement with the SASE classical model. However,

when ¯ρ

1 we obtain a quantum regime with features completely diﬀerent from those of

≤

the classical regime, and which we shall refer as Quantum SASE. A surprising feature of this

regime is the phenomenon of “quantum puriﬁcation”, in which the random spiking behavior

almost disappears and a strong narrowing of the spectrum occurs. Here we generalize a

previous model [17] including propagation eﬀects via a multiple scaling method used in the

classical FEL theory of ref. [18]. This allows us to easily take into account the existence of

3

two diﬀerent spatial scales in the FEL: the variation of the electron distribution on the scale

of the radiation wavelength (describing the bunching) and the variation of the ﬁeld envelope

on the much longer scale of the cooperation length.

The quantum FEL is described by the following equations for the dimensionless radiation

amplitude A(¯z, z1) and the matter wave ﬁeld Ψ(θ, ¯z, z1):

These equations were derived in detail in ref.[17], to describe Collective Recoil Lasing (CRL)

in FELs and in atomic systems.

In the CRL equations, the electrons are described by

a Schr¨odinger equation for a matter-wave ﬁeld Ψ [19, 20] in a self-consistent pendulum

FEL theory [1, 2, 10], i.e. θ = (k + kw)z

ckt is the electron phase, where kw = 2π/λw and

Hence, the dimensionless density proﬁle I0(z1) =

2 is independent of ¯z. This means

that the spatial distribution of the particles does not change appreciably on the slow scale

z1 during the interaction with the radiation.

Whereas the classical FEL equations in the above universal scaling do not contain any

explicit parameter (see ref. [9, 10]), the quantum FEL equations (1) and (2) depend on the

quantum FEL parameter

From the deﬁnition of A, it follows that ¯ρ

maximum value of the order of unity, ¯ρ represents the maximum number of photons emitted

per electron, and the classical regime occurs for ¯ρ

1. Note also that in Eq. (1) ¯ρ appears

≫

as a “mass” term, so one expects a classical limit when the mass is large. As we shall see,

when ¯ρ < 1 the dynamical behavior of the system changes substantially from a classical to

a quantum regime.

A further inspection of Eq. (1) shows that Ψ depends explicitly on θ, which describes

the variation (bunching) on the scale of the radiation wavelength λ. The parametrical

dependence on z1 is induced by the slow spatio-temporal evolution of the ﬁeld amplitude

A. This evolution is described by Eq. (2), in which the bunching factor is the ensemble
average of e−iθ. In other words, the N-particle system is described as a quantum ensemble

represented by the matter-wave ﬁeld Ψ. This model has been used previously to describe the

quantum regime of an FEL [19] and of the Collective Atomic Recoil Laser (CARL) [21, 22,

23, 24, 25, 26], neglecting the dependence on z1, i.e., propagation. This is appropriate for the

FEL when slippage due to the diﬀerence between the light and electron velocities is neglected,

which is never true in the SASE regime where the propagation from one cooperation length

to another is fundamental.

The classical limit of the FEL can be explicitly shown as follows. Eq.(1) can be trans-

formed into an equation for the Wigner function, as shown in ref. [20]:

ref. [18]. Note that Eqs. (6) and (7) do not depend explicitly on ¯ρ, as must be the case in

the classical model with universal scaling [9, 10]. We brieﬂy mention that Eq. (5) for the

Wigner function has a broader validity than the Schr¨odinger equation (1), since it can also

describe a statistical mixture of states which cannot be represented by a wave function but

rather by a density operator.

Eqs.(1) and (2) are conveniently solved in the momentum representation. Assuming that

Ψ(θ, z1, ¯z) is a periodic function of θ, it can be expanded in a Fourier series:

so inserting Eq. (8) into Eqs. (1) and (2), we obtain

coherent superposition of diﬀerent momentum states. The stability analysis of Eqs. (9) and

(10) has been carried out in ref. [24, 25, 26] for the case with no propagation. We assume

that the system is in an equilibrium state with no ﬁeld, A = 0, and all the electrons are in

the state n = 0, with c0 = 1 and cm = 0 for all m

= 0. This equilibrium state is unstable

when the dispersion relation

has complex roots. Notice that this dispersion relation coincides with that of a classical

FEL with an initial energy spread with a square distribution and width 1/¯ρ [10], i.e., this

“mass” ¯ρ3/2 in a self-consistent pendulum potential. This provides an intuitive interpretation

of the classical limit which holds when the particle’s “mass” is large.

We now discuss some analytical results arising from the quantum SASE model. It has

been shown in a previous work [17] that the classical model of Eqs. (6) and (7) admits a
soliton-like self-similar solution A(¯z, z1) = z1A1(y) when ¯δ = 0, where y = √z1(¯z

show [10] that in the linear regime the radiation pulse has a maximum at z1 = ¯z/3 and

propagates at a constant velocity vs = 3vr/(2 + βr).

An analogous self-similar solution also exists for the quantum equations (14)-(16) when

∆ = 0 [28], i.e. A(¯z, z1) = z1A2(x), where x = ¯ρz1(¯z

In this case, the radiation

pulse in the linear regime has a maximum at z1 = ¯z/2 and moves at the constant velocity

From the features of the self-similar solutions we can deduce some important aspects of

the nature of the random spikes emitted in the SASE regime. First, both in the classical

Let us now brieﬂy restate the reasons for the classical random spiking behavior. If the

bunch length contains many cooperation lengths Lc, each of them radiates a superradiant

spike independently as the electron bunch propagates into the wiggler. Each spike is only

roughly represented by a self-similar solution because the radiation from one portion does

not ﬁnd fresh electrons but electrons which have already interacted with radiation. As

discussed in [1] the number of spikes increases with the number of cooperation length in the

bunch, i.e. Lb/2πLc .

We now describe the numerical solution of Eqs.(1) and (2) which demonstrates the diﬀer-

ent dynamical behavior in the classical and quantum SASE regimes. The SASE simulation

has been performed assuming all the electrons are initially in the n = 0 momentum state

and that there is a weak randomly ﬂuctuating modulation in the electron density along the

electron pulse, as is appropriate to model random electron shot noise. The initial condi-

tions for all the simulations are therefore A(z1, ¯z = 0) = 0, c−1(z1, ¯z = 0) = b0eiφ(z1) and

c0(z1, ¯z = 0) =
values in the range [0, 2π). Since there is not a radiation seed, we assume ¯δ = 0.

frequency and ω is the carrier resonant frequency. In ﬁg. 2a and 2b , z1 = 0 is the trailing

edge and z1 = 30 is the leading edge of the electron bunch. Therefore, the region on the left

of the dotted line is the radiation on the electron beam, on the right is free propagation in

vacuum.

Alternatively one can interpret ﬁg. 2a and 2b as the temporal behavior of the intensity

for an observer which is at a given position in the wiggler and which will see the pulse as it

appears from right to left in the ﬁgure. We stress that in the classical theory with universal

scaling the two cases should be identical. On the contrary, the dramatic diﬀerence is evident

from ﬁg. 2: the temporal structure in the classical limit (ﬁg. 2a) is almost chaotic and the

width of the spectrum is large (ﬁg. 2c). Conversely, the temporal behavior in the quantum

limit (ﬁg. 2b) shows a puriﬁcation of the initially noisy evolution so that the temporal

structure looks similar to the self similar solution one would obtain with a coherent seed

signal. The corresponding spectrum becomes extremely narrow (ﬁg. 2d), much sharper than

the classical one.

It can be seen in ﬁg. 2d that the frequency is shifted by 1/2¯ρ = 10,

in agreement with the predictions of the linear analysis described earlier (see ﬁg. 1). The

behaviour of the system is similar to what would be expected if the quantum cooperation

length is much larger than the classical cooperation length, so that all electrons radiate

coherently in the quantum regime. The diﬀerence between classical and quantum SASE

behavior is conﬁrmed by a comparison of ﬁg. 3a and 3b, which show the total radiated

energy, E (in units of

2), in the classical and quantum regimes respectively, where

In the quantum regime we observe a behavior similar to that which one would obtain with

a coherent seed signal in the long bunch superradiant case [9, 10].

Finally, we discuss the reason for quantum puriﬁcation of the spectrum. As remarked

earlier, in ﬁg 1 the gain bandwidth (which is the reciprocal of the “real” coherence length)

decreases as ¯ρ3/2 in the quantum regime. Note that the cooperation length in the quantum

c = Lc/√¯ρ, has the same dependence on ¯ρ. Hence, one can understand that in
quantum SASE, i.e., for small value of ¯ρ, the system behaves as if the startup of the FEL

interaction is initiated by a coherent bunching or coherent seed.

In conclusion, in this letter we have given a proof of principle of the novel regime of

Quantum SASE, with dynamical properties very diﬀerent from “normal” classical SASE.

In particular, quantum SASE predicts quantum puriﬁcation of the temporal structure and

spectrum. The possibility of experimental observation of this quantum regime is under

investigation and will be discussed elsewhere.

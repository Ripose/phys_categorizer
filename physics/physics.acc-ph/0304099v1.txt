Abstract

Classical mechanical treatment of charged particle beam optics is
so far very satisfactory from a practical point of view in applica-
tions ranging from electron microscopy to accelerator technology.
However, it is desirable to understand the underlying quantum
mechanics since the classical treatment is only an approximation.
Quantum mechanical treatment of spin- 1
2 particle beam transport
through optical elements with straight optic axes, based on the
proper equation, namely, the Dirac equation, has been developed
already to some extent. In such a theory the orbital and spin mo-
tions are treated within a uniﬁed framework. Here, after a brief
review of the Dirac spinor beam optics for systems with straight
optic axes it is outlined how the application of the formalism of
general relativity leads to the use of the Dirac equation for get-
ting a quantum theory of spin- 1
2 beam transport through optical
elements with curved axes.

1. Introduction

It is surprising that the development of a quantum theory of electron beam
optics based on the proper equation, namely, the Dirac equation, has only
a recent origin [1, 2, 3]. The theory of charged particle beam optics, cur-
rently used in the design and operation of various beam devices, in electron

microscopes or accelerators, is largely based on classical mechanics and clas-
sical electrodynamics. Such a treatment has indeed been very successful in
practice. Of course, whenever it is essential, quantum mechanics is used in
accelerator physics to understand those quantum eﬀects which are prominent
perturbations to the leading classical beam dynamics [4]. The well-known ex-
amples are quantum excitations induced by synchrotron radiation in storage
rings, the Sokolov-Ternov eﬀect of spin polarization induced by synchrotron
radiation, etc. Recently, attention has been drawn to the limits placed by
quantum mechanics on achievable beam spot sizes in particle accelerators,
and the need for the formulation of quantum beam optics relevant to such
issues [5]. In the context of electron microscopy scalar wave mechanics based
on the nonrelativistic Schr¨odinger equation has been the main tool to ana-
lyze the image formation and its characteristics, and the spin aspects are not
considered at all [3].

In the context of accelerator physics it should be certainly desirable to
have a uniﬁed framework based entirely on quantum mechanics to treat the
orbital, spin, radiation, and every aspect of beam dynamics, since the con-
stituents of the beams concerned are quantum particles. First, this should
help us understand better the classical theory of beam dynamics. Secondly,
there is already an indication that this is necessary too: it has been found that
quantum corrections can substantially aﬀect the classical results of tracking
for trajectories close to the separatrix, leading to the suggestion that quantum
maps can be useful in ﬁnding quickly the boundaries of nonlinear resonances
[6]. Thus, a systematic formalism for obtaining the relevant quantum maps
is required.

The aim of this article is present a brief summary of the formalism quan-
tum beam optics of particles, in particular, Dirac particles, for treating prob-
lems of propagation through optical elements with straight and curved axes.

2. Quantum Beam Optics of Particles: An Outline

One may consider obtaining the relevant quantum maps for any particle opti-
cal system by quantizing the corresponding classical treatment directly. The
best way to do this is to use the Lie algebraic formalism of classical beam dy-
namics developed particularly in the context of accelerator physics [7]. The
question that arises is how to go beyond and obtain the quantum maps more
completely starting ab initio with the quantum mechanics of the concerned
system since such a process should lead to other quantum corrections not

Essentially, one should obtain a quantum beam optical Hamiltonian ˆ

such that the quantum beam optical Schr¨odinger equation

Now, we can consider the expectation values, such as

example shows, generally, the leading quantum eﬀects on the classical beam
optics can be expected to be due to the uncertainties in the initial conditions
like the term a

in the context of electron microscopy [8].

The above theory is only a single-particle theory. To include the mul-
tiparticle eﬀects, it might be proﬁtable to be guided by models such as the
thermal wave model and the stochastic collective dynamical model developed
for treating the beam phenomenologically as a quasiclassical many-body sys-
tem [9, 10].

3. Quantum Beam Optics of Dirac Particles: Optical Elements
with Straight Axes

The proper study of spin- 1
2 particle beam transport should be based on the
Dirac equation if one wants to treat all the aspects of beam optics including
spin evolution and spin-orbit interaction. Let us consider the particle to have
mass m, electric charge q and an anomalous magnetic moment µa. It should
be noted that the electromagnetic ﬁelds of the optical systems are time-
independent. In this case one can start with the time-independent equation
for the 4-component Dirac spinor ψ (r⊥; z)

ˆHψ (r⊥; z) = Eψ (r⊥; z) ,

including the Pauli term to take into account the anomalous magnetic mo-
ment. Here, we are using the standard notations as is clear from the context.
Let us assume that we are interested in studying the transport of a mo-
noenergetic quasiparaxial particle beam through an optical element which
has a straight optic axis along the cartesian z-direction. If p is the design
momentum of the beam the energy of a single particle of the beam is given
by E = √m2c4 + c2p2. Further, the quasiparaxial beam propagating along
the z-direction should have
= p and pz > 0. Then, actually Eq. (8)
has the ideal structure (compare Eq. (1)) for our purpose since it is already
linear in ∂
∂z . So, one can readily rearrange the terms in it to get the desired
form of Eq. (1). However, it is diﬃcult to work directly with such an equa-
tion since there are problems associated with the interpretation of the results
using the traditional Schr¨odinger position operator. In the standard theory
of relativistic quantum mechanics the Foldy-Wouthuysen (FW) transforma-
tion technique is used to reduce the Dirac Hamiltonian to a form suitable
for direct interpretation in terms of the nonrelativistic part and a series of
relativistic corrections. The FW technique was used originally by Derbenev
and Kondratenko to get their Hamiltonian for radiation calculations. This
theory has been reviewed and used to suggest a quantum formulation of Dirac
particle beam physics, particularly for polarized beams, in terms of machine
coordinates, observables, and the Wigner function [11].

In an independent and diﬀerent approach an FW-like technique has been
used to develop a systematic formalism of Dirac particle beam optics in which
the aim has been to expand the Dirac Hamiltonian as a series of paraxial and
nonparaxial approximations [1, 2, 8, 12]. This leads to the reduction of the
original 4-component Dirac spinor to an eﬀective 2-component spinor

which satisﬁes an accelerator optical Schr¨odinger equation

It should be noted that the 2-component ψa is an accelerator optical approx-
imation of the original 4-component Dirac spinor, valid for any value of the
design momentum p from nonrelativistic to extreme relativistic region.

where γ = E/mc2, ǫ = 2mµa/¯h and S = ¯h
2 σ represents the spin of the
particle deﬁned with reference to its instantaneous rest frame. It is to be
noted that this quantum accelerator optical Hamiltonian ˆ
contains all the
H
terms corresponding to the classical theory plus the ¯h-dependent quantum
correction terms. Using the formalism outlined in the previous section it
can be shown that the ﬁrst two ‘classical’ paraxial terms of the above ˆ
H
account for the linear phase-space transfer map corresponding to the focusing
(defocusing) action in the yz-plane and defocusing (focusing) action in the
xz-plane when G > 0 (G < 0). The last spin-dependent term accounts
for the Stern-Gerlach kicks in the transverse phase-space and the Thomas-
Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi spin evolution [12].

The following interesting aspect of quantum beam optics should be men-
tioned. In the case of a spin-0 particle also one can derive the quantum beam
optical Hamiltonian ˆ
starting from the Schr¨odinger-Klein-Gordon equation
H
[8]. It would also contain all the terms corresponding to the classical theory
plus the quantum correction terms. But, these quantum correction terms
are not identical to the quantum correction terms in the Dirac case. Thus,
besides in the ¯h-dependent eﬀects of spin on the orbital quantum map (e.g.,
the last term in Eq. (13)), even in the spin-independent quantum corrections
the Dirac particle has its own signature diﬀerent from that of a spin-0 parti-
cle [13].

4. Quantum Beam Optics of Dirac Particles: Optical Elements
with Curved Axes

For studying the propagation of spin- 1
2 particle beams through optical ele-
ments with curved axes it is natural to start with the Dirac equation written
in curvilinear coordinates adapted to the geometry of the system. Let us
make the z-axis coincide with the space curve representing the optic axis of
the system, or the ideal design orbit. Let the transverse, or oﬀ-axis, coordi-
nates (x, y) at each z be deﬁned in such a way that the spatial arc element
ds is given by

ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + ζ 2dz2,

ζ = (1 + K ⊥ ·

r⊥),

(14)

where Kx(z) and Ky(z) are the curvature components at z.

Now, we have to start with the Dirac equation written in a generally
covariant form. To this end, let us use the formalism of general relativity
[2, 14, 15]. Here, for the sake of simplicity let us drop the anomalous magnetic
moment term. Then the generally covariant form of the time-dependent
Dirac equation becomes

ˆHψ (r⊥; z) = Eψ (r⊥; z)

(18)

where ˆH is the same as in Eq. (15). We should now cast Eq. (18) in the form of
Eq. (1) so that the corresponding beam optical Hamiltonian ˆ
can be derived
H
and the formalism of Sec.2 can be applied for obtaining the transfer maps for
the quantum averages. It should be noted that the quantum operators for the
transverse position (ˆr⊥) and momentum (ˆp⊥), and spin (S), are unaltered.
The method of deriving ˆ
proceeds in the same way as for systems with
H
straight optic axes: a series of FW-like transformations are to be applied to
Eq. (18) up to any desired order of accuracy so that ﬁnally a 2-component
equation like Eq. (10) is obtained [2]. In general, for a magnetic system we
get, up to the ﬁrst order, or paraxial, approximation,

For a closed orbit in the xz-plane, with no torsion, writing ζ = 1 + x

is clear that ˆ
of Eq. (19) corresponds to the well known Hamiltonian of
H
classical accelerator optics [16]. To get a more complete form of ˆ
including
H
the spin terms and other ¯h-dependent quantum corrections one has to carry
out the FW-like transformations to higher orders.

5. Concluding Remarks

In summary, it is seen that the quantum theory of transport of particle
beams through optical elements is very simple. Starting from a beam optical
Schr¨odinger equation the transfer maps for quantum averages of phase-space
and spin variables across an optical element can be computed by a straight-
forward procedure. To this end, one has to obtain the appropriate quantum
beam optical Hamiltonian starting from the corresponding time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation of the system. As example, quantum theory of prop-
agation of Dirac particle beams through optical elements with straight and
curved optic axes was considered brieﬂy. So far, the development of such a
theory has not taken into account multiparticle eﬀects. Also, such a theory
has been developed only for optical systems. Taking into account the multi-
particle eﬀects and treating accelerating elements are issues of the theory to

be tackled in future.

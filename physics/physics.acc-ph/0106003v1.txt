HAMILTONIAN FORMALISM FOR SOLVING THE VLASOV-POISSON
EQUATIONS AND ITS APPLICATION TO THE COHERENT
BEAM-BEAM INTERACTION

Abstract

A Hamiltonian approach to the solution of the Vlasov-
Poisson equations has been developed. Based on a nonlin-
ear canonical transformation, the rapidly oscillating terms
in the original Hamiltonian are transformed away, yielding
a new Hamiltonian that contains slowly varying terms only.
The formalism has been applied to the coherent beam-beam
interaction, and a stationary solution to the transformed
Vlasov equation has been obtained.

1

INTRODUCTION

The evolution of charged particle beams in accelerators
and storage rings can often be described by the Vlasov-
Maxwell equations. At high energies the discrete-particle
collision term [1] comprises a small correction to the dy-
namics and can be neglected. Radiation effects at sufﬁ-
ciently high energies for leptons can be a signiﬁcant fea-
ture of the dynamics, and should be included in the model
under consideration.

The Vlasov-Maxwell equations constitute a considerable
simpliﬁcation in the description of charged particle beam
propagation. Nonetheless there are only a few cases that are
tractable analytically. Therefore, it is of utmost the impor-
tance to develop a systematic perturbation approach, able
to provide satisfactory results in a wide variety of cases of
physical interest.

Particle beams are subject to external forces that are of-
ten rapidly oscillating, such as quadrupolar focusing forces,
RF ﬁelds, etc. In addition, the collective self-ﬁeld excita-
tions can be rapidly oscillating as well. A typical example
is a colliding-beam storage ring device, where the evolu-
tion of each beam is strongly affected by the electromag-
netic force produced by the counter-propagating beam. The
beam-beam kick each beam experiences is localized only in
a small region around the interaction point, and is periodic
with a period of one turn.

In this and other important cases one is primarily inter-
ested in the long-time behavior of the beam, thus discard-
ing the fast processes on time scales of order the period
of the rapid oscillations. To extract the relevant informa-
tion, an efﬁcient method of averaging is developed in the
next section. Unlike the standard canonical perturbation
technique [2, 3], the approach used here is carried out in
a “mixed” phase space (old coordinates and new canonical
momenta), which is simpler and more efﬁcient in a compu-
tational sense. The canonical perturbation method devel-

oped here is further applied to the coherent beam-beam in-
teraction, and a coupled set of nonlinear integral equations
for the equilibrium beam densities has been derived.

2 THE HAMILTONIAN FORMALISM

We consider a N -dimensional dynamical system, de-
scribed by the canonical conjugate pair of vector variables
(q, p) with components

q = (q1, q2, . . . , qN ),
p = (p1, p2, . . . , pN ).

(2.1)

The Vlasov equation for the distribution function f (q, p; t)
can be expressed as

∂f
∂t

+ [f, H] = 0,

(2.2)

where

−

∂F
∂qi

∂F
∂pi

[F, G] =

∂G
∂pi
is the Poisson bracket, H(q, p; t) is the Hamiltonian of the
system, and summation over repeated indices is implied.
Next we deﬁne a canonical transformation via the generat-
ing function of the second type according to

∂G
∂qi

(2.3)

S = S(q, P; t),

and assume that the Jacobian matrix

is non-degenerate with

Jij (q, P; t) =

∂2S
∂qi∂Pj

det (Jij ) 6= 0,

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

so that the inverse J −1
ij exists. Let us also deﬁne the distri-
bution function in terms of the new coordinates (Q, P) and
the mixed pair (q, P) as

f (q, p; t) = f0(Q, P; t) = F0(q, P; t).

(2.7)

The new canonical variables (Q, P) are deﬁned by the
canonical transformation as

pi =

∂S
∂qi

,

Qi =

∂S
∂Pi

.

(2.8)

Because

=⇒

(2.9)

we can express the Poisson bracket in terms of the mixed
variables in the form

where the new Hamiltonian K is a function of the new
canonical pair (Q, P), such that

As an application of the formalism developed in the pre-
vious section we study here the evolution of two counter-
propagating beams, nonlinearly coupled by the electromag-
netic interaction between the beams at collision. For sim-
plicity, we consider one-dimensional motion in the vertical

equations

the Vlasov equation (2.20) is expressed as a function of the
new Hamiltonian. Following the procedure outlined in the

5 CONCLUDING REMARKS

We have developed a systematic canonical perturbation
approach that removes rapidly oscillating terms in Hamil-
tonians of quite general form. The essential feature of this
approach is the use of mixed canonical variables. For this
purpose the Vlasov-Poisson equations are transformed to
mixed canonical variables, and an appropriate perturbation
scheme is chosen to obtain the equilibrium phase space
density. It is worthwhile to note that the perturbation ex-
pansion outlined in the preceding section can be carried
out to arbitrary order, although higher-order calculations
become very tedious.

The canonical perturbation technique has been applied to
study the one-dimensional beam-beam interaction. In par-
ticular, rapidly oscillating terms due to the periodic beam-
beam kicks have been averaged away, yielding a time-
independent new Hamiltonian. Furthermore, the equilib-
rium distribution functions have been obtained as a general
function of the new Hamiltonian, and a coupled set of inte-
gral equations for the beam densities has been derived.

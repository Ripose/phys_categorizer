Energy Diﬀerential Structure and Exchange of A Micro Flux Increment of Charged
Particles in Longitudinal Acceleration

Ji Luo, Chuang Zhang∗
Accelerator Center, Institute of High Energy Physics, Beijing, China
(Dated: February 2, 2008)

Diﬀerential energy structure of a micro multi-charged-particle system and the beam internal
potential energy is derived with consequent property and necessary inference. Then by combining
the energy diﬀerential structure with diﬀerential transfer relations of physical ﬂux density between
diﬀerent time domains, we present a general explicit formula for energy exchange in the beam
element’s transfer or accelerating process between source and observer, further give an analysis
on relativistic beam’s mass-energy relation and beam’s energy up limits for resonant frequency
(rf) and DC acceleration. Finally we discuss the property of elementary charge density ﬁeld and
consequences.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Tracing the energy gain process of high energy electrons beam through rf acceleration, it would be known that the
longitudinally internal charge density ﬁeld’s aﬀection or contribution to the total energy of the group of electrons
should be considered as the electron number density in longitudinal axis increases progressively due to accumulated
compression, especially when its average velocity of the group of electrons becomes almost independent to the energy
after the velocity approaching light speed. However, their functions to energy ﬂux density basically are neglected
except treating them for beam instability and impedance [1, 2, 3, 4]. From general mechanics, the multi-particles
system’s energy in complete inertial frame where both ~f ( ˙t) = m~¨r and ~f ( ˙t) · dr = dE( ˙t) exist simultaneously can be
divided into two essential parts: mass center’s kinetic energy and system’s internal energy; the latter could be further
divided into two constituents: relative mass center’s kinetic energy and internal potential energy whose rate equals
the rate of work done by internal forces negatively. Upon number density’s instantaneous distribution in longitudinal
axis and corresponding velocity distribution of the micro particle system, we set up the explicit formulas on mass-
center kinetic energy, relative mass center kinetic energy, internal electrical potential energy and its changing rate.
Then based on diﬀerential transfer relation of energy ﬂux [5] and the energy diﬀerential structure, we analyze and
discuss the aﬀection and contribution of the internal charge ﬁeld to energy ﬂux and energy exchange as well as other
consequences.

It is shown in Eq. (17), (17′) that for internal force to do positive work will elongate the length, enlarge kinetic
energy spread and exhaust or consume the internal potential energy; for the force to do negative work, the length
will be compressed and kinetic energy spread reduced, internal potential energy increased. However once the internal
force starts to do negative work, the process will be irreversible without external power’s joining.

Above Eq. (23) and (24) is energy exchange relation between a micro beam element and external system during
the accelerating process within which the micro beam element travel through the space between source and detector.
For Jexc(t′) > 0 external system supplies energy to beam for contributing to either kinetic or potential energy or
both as well as time aﬀection factor.For Jexc(t′) < 0 external system gains energy from beam system, may from either
of kinetic or potential energy; in case the time factor determined by dynamical process can also aﬀect energy’s output
of micro beam element.

C.

Illustration or illustrative examples

1. Selection of time domains

This is completely dependent to which beam’s acceleration or transportation process you are interested in. The
ﬂux source and observing location could be selected at entrance and exit point or cross section of a resonant cavity
respectively where signal’s transfer time T (t) = T (t′) is just charged particle’s transit time. The ﬂux source and
observing location could also be selected at beam source (gun) and beam extracting point for tracing the whole
process of the beam’s acceleration and transportation drift where signal’s transfer time T (t) = T (t′) can be consisted
by various constituent Ti(ti−1) = Ti(ti) and there is consequent relation T (t) = T (t′) =
Ti(ti−1) [7]. Once the
time domains are decided, then all diﬀerential transfer relations [5] between the time domains and energy diﬀerential
information could be used to search exact solution.

Above inferences show that in constant state A, ρN (t′) = ρN (t) and without energy exchange; in elongation state
B, ρN (t′) < ρN (t) and internal potential energy releases to external system; in compression state C, ρN (t′) > ρN (t)
and internal potential energy increases result from beam’s gaining energy from external system.

Further more, we can make inferences below:

(i) For relativistic electron or ion beam, it’s energy increment or increase basically results from the gain of itself’s
potential energy through longitudinal compression, otherwise the beam’s energy will meet its limit, that is its
kinetic energy limit.

This is main diﬀerence of rf and DC acceleration method on electron beam’s energy up limits, for rf method
the bunch length can be compressed progressively further and further so that its energy will not meet up limit;
whereas using DC acceleration the length of a micro beam element is longer than the critical length within which
the beam’s internal potential energy can be existed or accumulated through further compression, in addition,
DC method has no compression mechanism. Thus DC acceleration beam’s energy has its energy limit, its kinetic
limit, even DC acceleration voltage has no technical limit.

We know that in DC acceleration the longitudinal length of a micro beam element is progressively elongated.

(ii) The mass of relativistic beam, collectives’ or individual’s, is independent to its energy.

From Eq. (25) it is known that the energy exchange of relativistic beam essentially depends upon beam internal
potential energy’s exchange with external system, the density of the particles number at observing location will
ﬂuctuate as the energy exchanger occur. And the number density’s change is synchronized with potential energy
gain or loss of the beam, as beam’s potential energy increases the density increases, while the energy losses the
density decreases. Since ρN [r0(t′)] = ρN [rs(t)] dt
dt′ = ρN [1 − dT (t
] then it is clear that the density’s ﬂuctuation
dt′
is time function related due to the variation of signal transfer time.

apply to

(r − rcc) dq = 0, there charge center rcc( ˙t), vcc( ˙t) etc.

Once charge’s electromagnetic interaction and charge’s potential energy are concerned its density ﬁeld eﬀect can not
be neglected anymore while merely regarding charge as a point charge whose charge all be centralized on its charge
center for approximatively simpliﬁed application.

Charge density ﬁeld can be compressed. Based on this, its internal potential energy can exist. In addition the
compression can bring about some electromagnetic consequences in magnetic dipole [8]. Density’s change will produce
internal force within charge density ﬁeld. The force depends upon both density’s diﬀerence between compressed
density and corresponding intrinsic density, and ratio of compression which is the intrinsic density related. So
calculation of stored potential energy of charge density ﬁeld precisely can only be done through corresponding relation
ρi( ˙t) dvi( ˙t) = ρoi dvoi, this may be uneasy to resolve since the density’s spatial distribution at any instant is not linear.
Fortunately in multi-particle system, a relative macro system, the density’s distribution at any instant comply to
linear distribution as we select the longitudinal length of the micro element short enough so that the compression
ratio or coeﬃcient µ can be treated as constant.

In addition, for the micro beam element, or ∆N number of particles, within a cylindrical volume with constant

radius a, there

∆N
πa2 = ∆ℓ( ˙t)¯ρ( ˙t) = constant

10

then ∆ℓ( ˙t) = ∆N

πa2 λ( ˙t) and ∆ℓ0 = ∆N

πa2 λ0, thus

∆ℓ0
∆ℓ( ˙t)

=

λ0
λ( ˙t)

So we can convert the ratio of the micro beam’s lengthes to ratio of individual particles’. Furthermore, we deﬁne

k and η, k( ˙t) = e−η( ˙t), for indicating individual charge ﬁeld’s compression and potential energy status.

B. Time function related factor and energy diﬀerential structure’s implication

A For charged particle’s longitudinal interaction, a particle behind with higher velocity than front particle’s can
not pass over the ahead particle; therefore related time function is positive reversible [7], dt
dt′ > 0, or
dt > −1 and dT (t
dT (t)
dt′ factor can contribute to enhance or decrease output number ﬂux, mass
ﬂux, charge ﬂux, energy ﬂux Jexc(t′) (Ref. Eq. (24)), however its value is determined by energy exchange of
external system and micro beam element.

B The energy diﬀerential structure and relevant inference emphasize beam’s itself property and nature. The work,
combined with diﬀerential transfer relations [5] and other tools, can help us insight beams inner behavior and
response and tracing a speciﬁed micro beam element whole physics process of beams’ energy components and
exchange. With it we may evaluate some conventional dictations and interpretations in diﬀerential angle.

VI. CONCLUSION

Energy of a micro beam element is consisted of three parts, mass center and relative center mass kinetic energy and
beam’s internal potential energy. Each of them is particle’s longitudinal velocity distribution and density (number,
consequent mass and charge as well as internal charge ﬁeld force) distribution related within the micro element.
The internal potential energy exists until its length shorter than the critical length or individual charge density
ﬁeld’s diameter shorter than its intrinsic diameter results form accumulated compression of the beam length. And
quantitative the potential energy comply with logarithm function with respect to the longitudinal length variable. For
relativistic beam, its energy exchange essentially occur actually between external system’s energy and beam’s internal
potential energy; at same time beam’s mass, collective’s or individual’s, is independent to its energy. Time function
factor can aﬀect various ﬂuxes of the beam simultaneously and the factor is determined by designated dynamical
process or energy exchange between external system and beam itself.

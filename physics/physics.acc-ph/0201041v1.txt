Abstract

In work is considered average transverse dynamics of an electron beam
in the autoresonant laser.
It is shown, that in approach of the given
external electromagnetic wave (small gain free electron laser) transverse
emittance of a beam of the charged particles decreases. This for the ﬁrst
time found out eﬀect can be used for cooling beams of various accelerators
of the charged particles. In the ﬁeld of particle energy about 100 in the
mass energy units, beam energy losses are negligible. This method of
charge beams cooling may be applied to electron, muon and various heavy
particle beams.

Enough methods of the charged
particle accelerator beam cooling
based on tested and used on various
accelerators physical principles now
are known: radiating [1], electron [2],
stochastic [3] and Doppler [4] cooling.
However they by the opportunities do
not meet more modern requirements.
Necessity for improvement of various
parameters of these methods has
resulted last years in consideration of
new beam cooling methods from
among which it is necessary to note
autoresonant [5], undulator [6],
ionization [7], laser [8] and stimulated
radiation or Doppler [9] cooling. The
special attention is given to cooling
by backward Compton scattering of
free electrons on photons [10-12]. It is
known, however, that the stimulated
scattering under other equal
conditions has greater cross-section [
9,13 ], than those of free particles.
Therefore, as against the above-stated
ways of cooling, in the given work the
opportunity of transverse cooling of a
beam of relativistic charges is
considered at the stimulated or
resonant interaction of particles with
a ﬂat electromagnetic wave (photons).
For creation of conditions of resonant
bunch - wave interaction is entered
the homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld
directed along a direction of
movement of a beam. The magnetic
ﬁeld creates density correlations of a
beam current on the laser wavelength
that increases bunch - wave
interaction and makes it selective.
Interaction moving on a periodic
trajectory electrons with a ﬂat
monochromatic electromagnetic wave
is one of possible ways of ampliﬁcation
of an electromagnetic wave in the free

electron laser. Oﬀered in [14]
autoresonant free electron laser, based
on interaction of the charged particle
with the electromagnetic wave
extending along a homogeneous
magnetic ﬁeld B0 k z, is characterized
by a detuning constancy from an
exact resonance at charged particle
energy change. In [15] shown, that
the detuning constancy connected to
existence of motion integral

I = γ − Pz

takes place only in approach of the
given external wave. Here γ is the full
energy, and P momentum of a particle
along a magnetic ﬁeld (in terms of
m=c=1). In the present work
inﬂuence of autoresonant interaction
of a particle with a wave on a beam
transverse emittance is examined.

As shown in works [14-16],
trajectories of electrons are screw

As drift of the center of a Larmor
circle absence and I ¿ 0, interaction in
a mode of the laser ( ˙γ < 0) means
reduction of a beam transverse
emittance, because of negativity of

the right part in (2). In a laser mode
the ampliﬁed wave carried away with
itself a part of beam energy. It is very
important to ﬁnd what part of wave
carried energy is from full beam
energy and what part is from beam
emittance, which means beam cooling
(emittance reduction). As it is not
diﬃcult to receive from (1), relative

reduction will be eﬀective for beams

losses are small. But in practical
applications it is possible also to
compensate beam energy losses by
external accelerating elements. In

in the equation (2) allows instead of a

ﬁeld ~B0, in a beam there are
correlations of density which result in
modulation of a beam on ( and
accordingly, to a nonzero right part

shall present function of distribution
of a beam as [17] f = f0 + δf , where
f0 is the basic equilibrium function of
distribution, and |δf | ≪ f0 is the

emphasize that the condition (13)
follows from a method of calculation.
The equation (2) fairly in approach of
the given external ﬁeld when
Leangmure frequency of a beam is
much less than frequency of the laser
[15]. It speciﬁes connection between
speed of transverse momentum
change and speed of a beam energy
change. For a beam withP0 = 100 and
divergence ϑ = 10−
2 the length of a way on
ξ = 10−
which transverse emittance change to
100 makes 80 cm, thus length of a
relaxation about 20cm. Thus,
autoresonant cooling of beams of
relativistic charges is much eﬀective
and faster than known and listed
above methods of cooling. It is very
eﬀective for beams with the
Lorenz-factor about 100, but is
applicable also to GeV particles and
for achievement comparable to
[10, 11] rates of cooling sources of
electromagnetic radiation, in this case
masers, with rather low and more real
capacities are required. We shall
notice that intensity of cooling
depends on parameter ξ, which is
easy for making about unity in
long-wave sources of radiation, for
example in masers. Thus it is much
less than loss of energy of a beam. If
to add to this an opportunity of
application of the longitudinal and -
or cross-section non-uniform magnetic
ﬁeld that enables scanning in case of a
beam with the big divergence, and
also selective cooling advantage of
this method becomes obvious. Hence,

autoresonant cooling, that is laser
cooling of beams of charges in a
longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld has a
number of advantages even in
comparison with the newest laser
[10, 11] and undulator cooling
methods, as because of a dependence
of cooling speed from a cross
momentum of particles and a beam as
a whole, and in connection with
formation of correlations of currents
of a beam and ample opportunities of
their management by heterogeneity of
a magnetic ﬁeld for increase of
eﬃciency and selectivity of cooling. In
this sense it is comparable to the
stimulated cooling methods. This
cooling, if applied, can to increase
signiﬁcantly the luminosity of the
storage ring and synchrotron beams,
due to decrease of the beam sizes.
Under certain conditions autoresonant
cooling can succesfully applied to
linac beams too and give a possibility
to achieve highest density and
luminosity beams with small sizes and
momentum spread.

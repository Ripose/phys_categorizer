A source of medical x-rays based on a 50 Mev storage ring and a quasi-continues picosecond laser
is considered. It is shown that such generator produces useful X-ray ﬂux with higher average power
and higher eﬃciency than that of conventional X-ray tubes. The main energy losses are related to
coherent synchrotron radiation. Taking this into account the required parameters of the storage
ring and injector are determined.

INTRODUCTION

The experiments with synchrotron radiation sources
conﬁrmed that the use of narrowband X-ray beams ex-
tends substantially diagnostics capabilities in mammog-
raphy, bronchography, angiography, computer tomogra-
phy etc [1] - [3]. Apart from the image contrast improve-
ment there are several other advantages of this method:
possibility for subtraction of images taken at the wave-
lengths before and after absorption K-edge of the con-
trast element (usually iodine), reduction of radiation
dose and amount of the contrast material, intravenous
(catheterless) angiography of coronary arteries, etc. Ac-
tually new attractive methods of X-ray diagnostics are
emerging.

However further development and practical applica-
tions of these methods depend on the availability of a
compact (as compared with synchrotrons) narrowband
X-ray source suitable for installation in medical centers
and hospitals. As a rule it should work in the energy
range 20 -50 kev that includes K absorption edges of the
elements I and Gd used in contrast compounds.

As a solution of the problem of narrowband compact
X-ray source it was proposed to generate X-rays in col-
lisions of a laser beam with an electron beam moving
in opposite direction. In such an approach the electron
beam energy decreases from several Gev (as for the sys-
tems based on synchrotrons with magnetic undulators)
to tens Mev and the dimension of the device changes
from tens of meters down to several meters. To produce
electron beams for this purpose both storage rings [4], [5]
and linear accelerators [6] can be utilized. In this paper
the energy losses and eﬃciency of X-ray generator based
on a storage ring and repetitive laser is considered (see
FIG. 1).

that both laser and electron beams consist of bunches fol-

section areas se = sL = s/2 (see Appendix A).

Using (1), (3) it is easy to show that X-ray ﬂux re-
quired by (1) can be attained with a system consisting of
a storage ring, a laser and an optical cavity, which param-
eters are given in Table I. The listed parameters either
have been already achieved or close to the achieved ones
in existing setups [10].

The electron bunch length in Table I was chosen equal
to double Raleigh length of laser beam:

distribution in transverse direction (see Appendix A).

III. THE SYNCHROTRON RADIATION LOSSES

The main source of electron energy losses in our stor-
age ring (see Table I) is coherent synchrotron radiation
(CSR), which spectrum lies in the microwave region.
The CSR power for a bunch with Gaussian longitudi-
nal charge density distribution can be estimated as (see
Appendix A):

·

Substituting the values from Table I for the LESG into

(2) and also supposing µ = 1 we obtain:

P = 1.1kW,

∆E = 11kev,

(5)

2

where ∆E is the energy lost by an electron in one rev-
olution. This energy loss is compensated by the storage
ring radio frequency (RF) cavity. The accelerating volt-
age there should not be less than U=250 kV in order to
provide the stability of the electron bunch (see Appendix
B). In the next section the storage ring power consump-
tion is estimated.

IV.

STORAGE RING AND INJECTOR

As an injector for the storage ring it is reasonable to
take a compact highly eﬃcient race-track microtron with
photo-cathode electron gun [11]. To simplify storage ring
operation the injection energy should be close to the ﬁnal
energy of the stored electrons. To store
1 nC charge
in a single ring bunch multi-turn injection can be used
with the injector operating in single bunch mode with
100-150 pC bunch charge and bunch repetition frequency
dependent on the ring damping time. The use of rare-
earth permanent magnets in the injector and storage ring
design will essentially decrease energy consumption.

∼

In the storage ring with permanent magnets the re-
quired electric power is deﬁned mainly by an RF power
PRF necessary to produce the accelerating structure volt-
age U inside the accelerating structure (single RF cavity
or a chain of coupled cavities):

PRF =

U 2
ZL

∝

where Z is the eﬀective shunt impedance and L is the
√fRF ,
structure’s electrical length. Because of Z
where fRF is operating frequency, for a ﬁxed structure
length the RF power required decreases with frequency
increase. Some aspects of storage ring beam dynamics
are also favorable to higher frequency. Other considera-
tions, in particular the separatrix size, the cavity beam
hole aperture favors lower frequency. The ﬁnal choice
hasn’t been made yet, so two possibilities were consid-
ered: 2856 MHz – equal to the injector operating fre-
quency [11], and 571.2 MHz – the ﬁfth subharmonic.
Consider elliptical form cavity, which has 1.5-2 times
lower shunt impedance as compared with the optimized
cavity, but is more stable with respect to multipactor dis-
charge and parasitic modes excitation. With such a cav-
8 kW for L =
ity one obtains Z
0.2625 m (ﬁve half wavelength coupled cavities chain) at
2856 MHz, and Z
18 kW for
the single cavity of the same length at 571.2 MHz. The
RF power dissipated per unit length in the considered
cases is 30 kW/m and 69 kW/m, respectively. These
thermal loads will not change essentially structure pa-
rameters if the cooling channels are properly constructed.
Taking into account beam loading and RF ampliﬁer eﬃ-
ciency, the full power consumption from the socket will
be about 20 and 40 kW, respectively.

V. THE SOURCE OF THE OPTICAL
RADIATION AND ITS EFFICIENCY

Power consumption of optical unit of LEXG can be an
order of magnitude less than that required for RF sys-
tem if a solid state laser with diode pumping is used.
Such lasers reached tens of percent eﬃciency during last
decade. For example, in [12] the eﬃciency 28% is re-
ported for Nd:YAG laser having quasi-continuous output
with average power more than 300 W. The active element
was 6 mm diameter and 50 mm length cylinder pumped
by six high power diode bars.

Besides of eﬃciency, the stability of laser radiation is
one more important parameter for LEXG. The enhance-
ment of laser light power inside high ﬁnesse optical res-
onator implies both equal repetition rates and careful
phase matching of laser and resonator pulses. In other
words the most part of every laser mode energy must
be concentrated inside the bandwidth ∆νr of the cor-
r1/2Lc,
responding resonator mode,∆νr = c (1
where Lc is the length of the cavity. From this point
of view optically pumped solid state lasers generating
subpicosecond- and femtosecond pulses again have ev-
ident advantages [13]. For example, crystalline active
mediums doped with ytterbium are successfully utilized
for continues sequences of powerful subpicosecond pulses
production. In [14] the average power of 60 W was ob-
tained in a Yb:YAG laser with the duration of a single
pulse 0.81 ps, and optical power of a linier diode assem-
bly being 370 W. Estimated eﬃciency is not less than
5%.

·

A signiﬁcant decrease of the optical source average
power can be achieved with the transition from quasi-
continues ultrashort pulse sequence to generation of pulse
trains with train duration 2-4 ms corresponding to accu-
mulation time of one X-ray image and with train repeti-
tion rate being 20-30 Hz. Such mode of operation can be
reached using external negative feed-back loop [10].

Thus from the above discussion it follows that the
power necessary to feed the optical unit of LEXG is less
than 2-3 kW.

VI. DISCUSSION

∼

Estimations given in sections 4 and 5 show that for
production of
1 W (see (1)) of X-ray radiation with
photon energy ¯hωL = 33 kev a laser-electron X-ray gen-
erator with electrical power consumption 25-45 kW is
required. In respect of eﬃciency (the ratio of useful X-
ray ﬂux to electric power consumption) LEXG surpasses
X-ray tubes. Note that medical X-ray tubes utilized in
angiography have power up to 100 kW [9], [15], [16]. No
doubts that if physical and technical problems connected
with the development of LEXG are resolved such X-ray
sources will ﬁnd wide application in medicine and other
ﬁelds.

Except the scheme shown in ﬁgure 1 there are other
possibilities to increase the coupling of electron and

3

(7)

(8)

laser beams in order to provide necessary X-ray ﬂux.
For instance high-energy laser pulse circulation obtained
by switching of a Pockel’s cell inside the optical res-
onator may be used [17]. The practical optical scheme
should satisfy several conditions: resistance of the mir-
rors and other optical elements to laser and X-ray radia-
tion loading, synchronization of laser pulses with electron
bunches, time and phase matching of optical resonator
with the laser beam etc. This will require special re-
search.

VII. CONCLUSION

∼

A new X-ray generator for medical applications can
be designed on the basis of a storage ring with electron
energy
50 Mev and a picosecond laser. If high ﬁnesse
optical resonator is used the plug eﬃciency of such a
generator can be higher than that of conventional X-ray
tubes. Other advantages of LEXG as compared to X-
ray tubes are: narrowband X-ray beam, the absence of
high energy “tail” in photon spectrum, the possibility
of ﬁne tuning of X-ray photons energy by changing the
electron energy, image quality improvement by subtrac-
tion of images taken at diﬀerent wavelengths near iodine
K absorption edge, reduction of the necessary quantity
of contrast materials and radiation dose received by a
patient and medical staﬀ, opportunity of catheterless an-
giography introduction into the wide medical practice.

Thus, a compact laser-electron X-ray generator can be
considered as a promising direction of accelerator, laser
and optical technology development.

by E.G. Bessonov and R.M. Fechtchenko [22] supported
the results of L.Schiﬀ.

Incoherent synchrotron radiation and Thomson scat-
tering provide slow damping of the phase oscillations
and can be neglected in the ﬁrst approximation. Co-
herent synchrotron radiation force acting on the elec-
trons enlarges the bunch length [20]. The stability cri-
teria in terms of equation (9) are provided by relation
dV (ϕ)/dϕ < 0 kept in the vicinity of phase ϕs, occu-
pied by bunch electrons. Using equation for coherent

diation.

from the Table I into (11) we get U >120 kV. In or-
der the coherent synchrotron radiation would not change
essentially equilibrium bunch dimensions this inequality
must be fulﬁlled with some spare. More details for elec-
tron beam dynamics in the coherent synchrotron radia-
tion ﬁeld can be found in [22].

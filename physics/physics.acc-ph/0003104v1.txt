Abstract

The traditional method of spin-ﬂipping a stored polarized beam is based on slowly
crossing an rf induced depolarizing resonance. This paper discusses a novel approach
where the polarization reversal is achieved by trapping the beam polarization into a stable
spin-ﬂipping motion on top of the rf induced resonance at a half-revolution frequency.

1

Introduction

Developing the spin-ﬂipping technique is important for high energy spin experiments since
frequent reversals of the beam polarization can signiﬁcantly reduce systematic errors in an
experiment’s spin asymmetry measurements. To spin-ﬂip a stored polarized beam, one can
slowly ramp the frequency of an rf magnet (either solenoid or dipole) through the rf-induced
depolarizing resonance. This technique was successfully used to spin-ﬂip a polarized proton
beam stored in the IUCF Cooler Ring with and without Siberian Snake [1]. While slow
resonance crossing rate is required to achieve good spin-ﬂip eﬃciency, it also increases the time
of each spin-ﬂip. Moreover, it makes the spin motion sensitive to weak synchrotron sideband or
higher-order depolarizing resonances that may occur in the vicinity of the rf induced resonance.
In this paper we discuss another possible way of spin-ﬂipping the beam polarization by
rearranging the stable spin motion in such a way, that the polarization direction alternates on
every particle turn around the ring without any depolarization.

2 Stable spin motion at an RF induced resonance

In a circular accelerator or a storage ring with no Siberian Snakes, the spin vector of each
particle precesses around the vertical magnetic ﬁeld of the ring’s dipole magnets. For a particle
moving along the closed orbit, the spin tune νs, which is the number of spin precessions during
one turn around the ring, is proportional to the beam energy

νs = Gγ,

(1)

where γ is the Lorentz energy factor and G = (g − 2)/2 is particle’s gyromagnetic anomaly.
While for protons G = 1.79285, it is much smaller for electrons (G = 0.00116) and deuterons
(G = −0.1426).
its frequency is in resonance with the spin motion

This vertical spin precession can be perturbed by any horizontal rf magnetic ﬁeld, whenever

fRF = fcirc(k ± νs),

(2)

where fcirc is the beam circulation frequency and k is an integer. Near the rf induced reso-
nance, the spin precession becomes unstable, which could lead to depolarization of a vertically
polarized beam. However, the same rf magnetic ﬁeld establishes a new stable spin direction
in the horizontal plane. To show this, let us consider the spin motion in the presence of an rf
spin perturbation ε· e−iωθ, where ε is resonance strength and we assume that the perturbation
frequency ω = fRF /fcirc± k is close to the resonance condition of Eq.(2). The equation of spin
motion can be written for the spinor wave function ψ in the following form [2],

(3)

where θ is the azimuthal particle coordinate in the ring. In these notations, the diagonal terms
in Eq.(3) represent spin rotation around the vertical axis, while the oﬀ diagonal terms corre-
spond to horizontal spin perturbation. Transforming the above equation into the resonance
rotating frame, ψ = e−iωθσ3/2 · ξ, the equation of spin motion becomes

(4)

Note that exactly on top of the rf induced resonance Gγ−ω = 0, and the spin precesses around
the spin perturbing ﬁeld ε, which rotates with frequency ω = fRF /fcirc ± k in the laboratory
frame. Thus, the direction along the rotating spin perturbation vector becomes stable for the
spin motion in the presence of an rf perturbation. Next, we consider how the existence of such
a rotating horizontal stable spin direction can be used for spin-ﬂipping.

3 Spin-ﬂipping at selected energies in the absence of Siberian

snakes

As we saw in the previous section, an external rf magnetic ﬁeld, when at resonance with the
spin precession, creates a horizontal stable spin direction which rotates around the ring with
angular frequency

wθ = (fRF /fcirc ± k) θ = Gγθ.

(5)

When Gγ is equal to a half-integer number, the horizontal spin would rotate by exactly 180
degrees in one turn around the ring. Thus, the spin would ﬂip its direction after every turn.
This opens a possibility to organize the spin motion in such a way that spin would arrive
at the experimental section with longitudinal polarization, whose sign alternates on every
turn. A practical solution would require installing an rf solenoid at the experimental straight
section and matching the injected beam polarization with the longitudinal direction at the
experimental section. One can also use radial rf dipole ﬁeld to create a spin-ﬂipping motion
of a horizontal spin. The stable spin direction would be radial near the rf dipole, while in a
diﬀerent straight section it will be rotated towards the longitudinal direction by angle

φ = Gγθbend

(6)

where θbend is the orbit bend between the rf dipole and the point of interest. Note that the
spin tune Gγ should be half-integer for both the rf solenoid and rf dipole induced spin-ﬂipping.
There are several eﬀects that could potentially perturb the spin motion driven by the rf
magnet. With an energy oﬀset or spread present in the beam, particles will have their spin

precession frequency slightly shifted from the rf resonance. An oﬀset from the rf resonance
would tilt the stable spin direction out of the horizontal plane by an angle β,

β = tan−1(cid:18) ∆νs
ε (cid:19) ,

(7)

where ∆νs = G∆γ is the spin tune shift due to the energy oﬀset. The tilt in the stable spin
direction would in turn reduce the equilibrium horizontal beam polarization P by a factor of

∆P
P

ε (cid:19)2
= 1 − cos2 β ≃ (cid:18) ∆νs

(8)

Thus, in order to maintain control over the spin motion (∆P/P < 0.1), the rf induced resonance
should dominate over the energy spread,

ε ≥ 3 · ∆νs .

(9)

For example, to overcome a spin tune shift of 0.001 the strength of the rf induced resonance
should be about 0.003. The average stable polarization magnitude during the spin-ﬂipping
process is plotted against the ε/∆νs ratio in Fig. 1.

Similarly, the rf induced resonance should dominate over higher-order horizontal spin per-
turbations, which would also tend to perturb the stable spin direction. It is also important to
note that, in the spin-ﬂipping method described here, the rf solenoid would operate at exactly
one half of the beam circulation frequency. Therefore, one particular part of the beam would
always pass the rf magnet when its ﬁeld is very close to zero, and thus, would not have stability
of the horizontal spin. To avoid this problem, one could create a gap in the stored beam while

3

synchronizing the rf ﬁeld with the remaining beam bunches. Another solution could be to
use a high frequency rf-magnet (or a special rf-cavity) synchronized with every bunch in the
beam. This could be done when there is an odd number of bunches in the ring; the rf magnet
would then be operating at the frequency fRF = h
2 fcirc, where h is the harmonic number (odd
integer) of the main rf cavities.

4 Spin-ﬂipping in the presence of Siberian snakes

In the presence of a full Siberian snake [3] in the ring, the spin tune becomes half-integer and
energy independent. With a proper choice of the betatron tunes, a set of Siberian snakes can
overcome all dangerous depolarizing resonances in the ring [4]. Nevertheless, an rf magnetic
ﬁeld in resonance with the half-integer spin tune can depolarize the beam even in the presence
of a Siberian snake. These resonances are often called ”snake” depolarizing resonances [5].
Similarly to the case with no snake in the ring, such an rf induced ”snake” resonance can
create a rotating stable spin direction. Since the spin tune is half-integer in the presence of a
Siberian snake, this rotating stable spin direction would be ﬂipped after every turn around the
ring.

To create such a stable spin-ﬂipping mode of the spin motion, the rf magnetic ﬁeld has to be
orthogonal to the unperturbed spin. With a single snake in the ring and no spin perturbation
present, the stable spin direction is horizontal and coincides with the snake axis in the straight
section opposite to the snake location. Therefore, an rf dipole with vertical ﬁeld operating
at 0.5fcirc would make vertical direction stable for the spin motion, while the polarization
direction would ﬂip after every turn around the ring.

With an even number of snakes in the ring, the unperturbed stable spin direction is vertical.
Ideally, one could use longitudinal rf ﬁeld near the interaction region to create the longitudinal
spin stable and ﬂipping every turn around the ring. However, solenoids become impractical at
high energies since their spin rotation angle linearly decreases with the beam momentum. An
energy independent spin rotation in a dipole makes dipole magnets more attractive for spin
manipulation at high energies. An rf dipole with radial ﬁeld could create stable spin-ﬂipping
of the beam that has radial polarization near the rf dipole location, while at the experimental
straight section polarization would be longitudinal.

The stability of the continuous spin-ﬂipping motion could be lost when the spin-tune moves
out of the induced rf resonance. Such a spin tune shift could be caused by a small error in the
snake current or by to some high-order spin perturbation. As in the case with no Siberian snake
in the ring, the strength of the rf induced resonance determines the tolerable spin tune shift from
the half-integer value (as indicated in Eq.(8)). The eﬀect of the high-order spin perturbation
could be reduced by a proper choice of the betatron tunes. Therefore, an adequate strength of
the rf magnet (to achieve ε ≃ 10−3) and the snake current precision at the level of 10−4 would
provide stability of the spin-ﬂipping motion.
In practice, an rf dipole ﬁeld of 0.1 T could be obtained [6] in the frequency range near 20
kHz, which corresponds to a half of the circulation frequency in most high energy rings. The
spin perturbation strength by a 1-meter-long rf dipole of this type would be,

ε =

Ge

2π mc2 Z Bdl ∼ 0.01 (for protons) .

(10)

Such an rf dipole would certainly have adequate strength to control the spin motion.

frequency. The amplitude of the excited beam oscillations, X0, is determined by the rf kick amplitude
and the rf frequency separation from the betatron tune δ = νx − fRF

excited beam oscillations is achieved when rf dipole is turned on adiabatically.

5 Spin manipulation of a polarized deuteron beam

The technique discussed for spin-ﬂipping seems especially attractive for polarized deuteron
beams. The conventional spin manipulation methods become diﬃcult due to deuteron’s small
anomalous magnetic moment. A full Siberian snake would only be practical at low energies,
where solenoidal magnets could provide the required spin rotation (a 200 MeV deuteron beam
would require a solenoid with 11 T m ﬁeld integral). Similarly, the eﬀect of the rf magnetic
ﬁeld on spin will be rather small, which limits applicability of the conventional spin-ﬂipping
technique.
In contrast, the method presented here uses the accelerator lattice to ﬂip the
spin while the rf ﬁeld keeps the spin motion stable. This feature becomes an advantage for
particles with small anomalous magnetic moment in the energy region where Gγ < 10. In the
case of deuteron beam, stable spin-ﬂipping motion could be organized at the beam energies
corresponding to half-integer Gγ values

T [GeV] = 4.7 + 13.156 · n

(11)

where n is an integer. A strong rf ﬁeld could also create stability for the non-ﬂipping longi-
tudinal polarization direction when Gγ is an integer. In this case, rf ﬁeld should be strong
enough to dominate over the imperfection ﬁelds in the accelerator. Note that there are no such
ﬁrst-order spin perturbations near a half-integer Gγ, and the required rf ﬁeld could be much
weaker.

The direct eﬀect of the rf magnetic ﬁeld on the deuteron’s spin is rather small. However,
an rf-dipole also excite beam oscillations, and the spin is mainly driven by the quasi-resonant
accumulation of the spin kicks from all quadrupoles of the accelerator lattice. To estimate the
ampliﬁcation of the spin perturbation due to the excited beam oscillations, we ﬁrst calculate the
beam oscillation amplitude using the approach discussed in [7]. Considering the beam motion
in the phase space coordinates (x, x′βx), it is convienient to transform to the rf rotating frame

(12)

where νx is the horizontal betatron frequency and k is an integer. When the rf dipole is turned
on adiabatically, the excited beam oscillations reach a stable mode which is shown in Fig. 2.
The beam oscillation amplitude, X0, for this stable mode is given by

where β0 is the value of the horizontal beta-function near the rf dipole. The resulting beam
oscillations around the ring can be written as

(14)

where νRF = k + fRF /fcirc is the rf harmonic closest to the betatron tune (i.e. νRF ∼ νx). The
strength of the induced spin perturbation is given by the spin kick accumulated in the lattice
quadrupoles over one turn around the ring

(15)

where g(s) = ∂By/∂x
is normalized strength of the quadrupoles around the ring and νs is the
spin tune. Eq.(15) should be compared with the strength of the spin perturbation by the direct
eﬀect of the rf magnetic ﬁeld, which is given by

Bρ

(16)

In both cases, the eﬀect of transverse magnetic ﬁelds is proportional to the anomalous magnetic
moment [8]. Substituting Eq. (14) into Eq. (15) one would quickly obtain

εb = ε0

√β0
4πδ I g(s)qβx(s)ei(νs±νRF )θds.

(17)

When the spin tune is close to the frequency of the induced beam oscillations, |νs − νRF| ≪ 1,
one can neglect the exponent in the integral. The remaining integral resembles deﬁnition of
the chromaticity function ξx = −1
4π H g(s)βx(s) ≃ −νx. Therefore, the strength of the induced
spin perturbation can be estimated as

εb ≃ ε0

νx
δ

√β0

.

(18)

This estimate corresponds to the maximum ampliﬁcation of the spin perturbation which occurs
in the vicinity of the strong intrinsic depolarizing resonances νs ≃ νx, where the spin kicks
from all lattice quadrupoles are synchronized with the spin precession. Farther away from
these regions, the eﬀect of the induced beam oscillations on spin is reduced by the exponent
in the Eq. (17); in that case, smaller δ would enhance the excited beam oscillation amplitude
as well as the induced spin perturbation.

6

Finally, we would like to comment that acceleration of polarized deuterons seems possible in
modern high energy rings [9]. While full Siberian snakes do not seem practical for high energy
deuterons, their depolarizing resonances are 25 times weaker and 25 times farther apart than
for protons. Therefore, one could use individual resonance correction techniques developed
for proton beam at the AGS ring (Brookhaven Natl. Lab.). A partial Siberian snake could
overcome all imperfection depolarizing resonances [10]. Such a partial snake could be realized
either using a solenoid magnet or a set of correction dipoles distributed around the ring to
create a controlled closed orbit perturbation. Note that, in an ideal case, reversing the axis of
the partial snake could ﬂip the longitudinal polarization of the beam stored near an integer Gγ.
However, without additional correction of the natural imperfection resonance this spin-ﬂipping
method remains impractical due to inevitable polarization losses. The intrinsic depolarizing
resonances could be handled by an rf dipole which induces coherent beam oscillations and
makes intrinsic resonances strong enough to spin-ﬂip [11]. An rf spin perturbation could also
be used as a spin rotator for polarized deuterons. For example, to bring initial vertical beam
polarization to the longitudinal direction, a horizontal rf dipole ﬁeld could be applied for a
time period which corresponds to the required π/2 spin rotation.

6 Summary

In summary, we found that an external rf magnetic ﬁeld can be used to create a stable mode
of the spin motion, where the polarization direction ﬂips after every turn around the ring.
Such stable spin-ﬂipping spin motion can be realized whenever the spin tune is equal to a half
integer value; this is always true in the rings equipped with Siberian snakes, while rings without
Siberian snakes also reach half-integer spin tune at certain energies. The applied rf magnetic
ﬁeld should be orthogonal to the unperturbed stable spin direction, and should operate at
exactly one half of the circulation frequency. Provided that the rf ﬁeld is synchronized with
the circulating beam and is strong enough to dominate over possible spin tune spread, this
spin-ﬂipping motion is stable. It was also noted earlier [12], that the rf stabilization of the spin
motion against the spin tune spread is an interesting possibility for accelerators with Siberian
snakes.

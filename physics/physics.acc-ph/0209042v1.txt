Abstract

We consider the impedance of a structure with rectangular, periodic corrugations on two opposing

sides of a rectangular beam tube. Using the method of ﬁeld matching, we ﬁnd the modes in such

a structure. We then limit ourselves to the the case of small corrugations, but where the depth

of corrugation is not small compared to the period. For such a structure we generate analytical

approximate solutions for the wave number k, group velocity vg, and loss factor κ for the lowest

(the dominant) mode which, when compared with the results of the complete numerical solution,

agreed well. We ﬁnd:

if w

a, where w is the beam pipe width and a is the beam pipe half-

∼

height, then one mode dominates the impedance, with k

1/(aw), which (when replacing w by a) is the same scaling as was found for

small corrugations in a round beam pipe. Our results disagree in an important way with a recent

paper of Mostacci et al. [A. Mostacci et al., Phys. Rev. ST-AB, 5, 044401 (2002)], where, for the

rectangular structure, the authors obtained a synchronous mode with the same frequency k, but

with κ

δ. Finally, we ﬁnd that if w is large compared to a then many nearby modes contribute

to the impedance, resulting in a wakeﬁeld that Landau damps.

INTRODUCTION

In accelerators with very short bunches, such as is envisioned in the undulator region

of the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) [1], the wakeﬁeld due to the roughness of the

beam-tube walls can have important implications on the required smoothness and minimum

radius allowed for the beam tube. One model that has been used to study roughness is a

cylindrically-symmetric structure with small, rectangular, periodic corrugations. For such a

structure, if the depth-to-period ratio of the corrugations is not small compared to 1, it has

been found that the impedance is dominated by a single strong mode with wave number

1/√aδ, with a the structure radius and δ the depth of corrugation, and loss factor

k
κ = 4/a2 (in Gaussian units) [2, 3].

∼

In a recent report Mostacci et al. [4], studied the impedance of a structure with small,

rectangular, periodic corrugations on opposing sides of a rectangular beam tube using a

perturbation approach. For a beam tube with width w comparable to height 2a the authors

ﬁnd a mode with a similar frequency dependence as in the round case, but with a loss factor

that is proportional to the depth of corrugation δ. If this model is meant to represent surface
10−4 smaller

1 cm, then their result implies a factor

roughness with e.g. δ

1 µm and a

interaction strength than was obtained in the earlier cylindrically symmetric calculations.

Such a result seems unlikely—we would not expect a huge diﬀerence in loss factor when

changing from round to rectangular geometry. It is the goal of this paper to resolve this

discrepancy and to show that a correct calculation for the rectangular cross section indeed

gives a result that diﬀers only by a numerical factor from the round case.

Another motivation for this work is to understand the impedance of two corrugated plates,

the limit of our geometry when w becomes large. And although, when w is not large, the

geometry is somewhat artiﬁcial, it may still be a useful model for some vacuum chamber

objects of accelerators, e.g. for the screens in the LHC vacuum chamber [4]. And thirdly,

we note that fabricating a structure with artiﬁcially large corrugations, for the purpose of

experimentally studying roughness impedance, may be much easier for the rectangular than

the round beam pipe.

In this report we calculate the impedance of the rectangular structure of Mostacci et

al.—but not limiting ourselves to small corrugations—using the method of ﬁeld matching.

The solution is written as an inﬁnite homogeneous matrix equation that we truncate to

2

solve numerically. Note that our approach is very similar to that used for the analogous

cylindrically symmetric problem in the computer program TRANSVRS [5]. Note also that

recently, Xiao et al. used a similar method to solve the impedance of the rectangular

structure, but with the corrugated surfaces replaced by dielectric slabs [6]. Next, using a

perturbation approach applied to the ﬁeld matching equations we ﬁnd the analytical solution

for the limit of small corrugations. Finally, we compare the analytical to the numerical

results.

II. FIELD MATCHING

We consider a periodic, rectangular structure with perfectly conducting walls, two periods

of which are sketched in Fig. 1.

In the horizontal (x) direction the structure does not

vary, except for walls at x =

w/2. One period of the structure extends longitudinally to

±

p/2. This cell can be divided into two regions: Region I, the “tube region”, extends

a; Region II, the “cavity region”, for z =

g/2, extends beyond y =

a to

±

y =

(a + δ). An exciting point beam moves at the speed of light c from minus to plus

inﬁnity along the z axis. We are interested in the steady-state ﬁelds excited by the beam,

z =

and assume that initial transients have all died down. Note that we will work in Gaussian

units throughout.

We assume that the ﬁelds of a mode excited by the beam have a time dependence ejkct,

where k is the mode wave number and t is time. For either region the ﬁelds can be obtained

from two Hertz vectors, Πm and Πe, which generate, respectively, TM and TE components

the factor 1/(1

vg/c) is often neglected in loss factor calculations (it appears to have been

neglected in Mostacci et al.). This factor in the loss factor, which—as we will see—is very

important in structures with small corrugations, is discussed in Refs. [7, 8, 9]; we give a new

derivation of it in Appendix A. Finally the longitudinal wakeﬁeld is given as

with Φ(s) = 0 for s < 0, 1 for s > 0, and the sum is over all excited modes.

In Appendix B we present more details of the calculation of the modes of the corrugated

structure using ﬁeld matching. We have written a Mathematica program that numerically

solves these equations for arbitrary corrugation size. The results of this program will be

used to compare with small corrugation approximations presented in the following section.

III. SMALL CORRUGATIONS

Let us consider the case where the corrugations are small, but with δ

the analogous cylindrically symmetric structure it was found that: (i) there is one dominant

mode (its loss factor is much larger than those of the other modes), (ii) this mode has

a low phase advance per cell, and (iii) the frequency of the mode k

1/√aδ [3, 10].

∼

For our rectangular structure we look for a mode with the same properties. As was the

case for the cylindrically symmetric problem we also assume that the ﬁelds in the cavity

region are approximately independent of z, and that one term in the expansion of the Π

vectors, the term with n = 0 and s = 0, suﬃces to give a consistent solution to the ﬁeld

matching equations [3]. Note that, it is true that to match the tangential ﬁelds well on the

matching plane may require many space harmonics (though even then, near the corners,

Gibbs phenomena and the edge condition will result in poor convergence); nevertheless, as

with the analogous cylindrically symmetric problem, the global mode parameters in which

we are most interested—frequency k, group velocity vg, and loss factor κ—can be obtained

to good approximation when keeping only the one (the n = 0, s = 0) term.

Setting α = 0 implies that ΠII

we integrate the second equation over the gap in z. When we divide the resulting equations

one by the other, the constants C0, F0, drop out, and we are left with an approximation to

the dispersion relation, one valid in the vicinity of the synchronous point (the subscript 0

To properly keep track of the relative size of the terms in further calculations, we assign

to each parameter an order using the small parameter ǫ: let a, w, be of order 1; δ, g, p, of
order ǫ2; and k, β, of order 1/ǫ. To ﬁnd the synchronous frequency we let β = k in Eq. (13),

expand the equation to lowest order in ǫ, and then set ǫ = 1. The result is

rearrange terms to obtain 1

then the results for the two problems are the same [3]. Recently the modes in a rectangular

structure of Fig. 1, but with the corrugated surfaces replaced by dielectric slabs, have been

obtained by Xiao et al., also using a ﬁeld matching approach [6]. If we take their results,

letting the thickness of the dielectric layers (δ) be small, we obtain our results for k, vg, and

κ when we make the correspondence ǫ = p/(p

g).

A. Comparison with Numerical Results

To test the validity of the analytical approximations in the case of small corrugations,

we compare with numerical results obtained by the Mathematica ﬁeld matching program

(the method of solution is described in Appendix B). Consider as an example a square beam

tube (w/a = 2) with p/a = 0.05, g/a = 0.025, and δ/a = 0.025, and let us consider the

lowest (m = 1) mode. In the ﬁeld matching program we take

= 4 and

= 4, i.e. 5

S

N

space harmonics are kept in the cavity region and 9 in the tube region. (We ﬁnd that, for

the example geometry, keeping more terms has no signiﬁcant eﬀect on the results.)

We begin by comparing the dispersion curve (see Fig. 4). Shown are the ﬁeld matching

result (the solid curve) and the approximation, Eq. (13) (the dashes). We see that the two

agree well except far from the synchronous phase. The cross plotting symbol locates the

synchronous point, with kp = 0.200π, a result which is 7.5% larger than the analytical value

9

of Eq. (14). It is interesting to note that this dispersion curve is almost identical to the one

obtained (also by ﬁeld matching) for the same geometry but in a round beam pipe [3]. As

for the loss factor, we ﬁnd that it is a factor 0.84 as large as the analytical approximation,

Eq. 16.

FIG. 4: A dispersion curve example: shown are the numerical result (solid), the synchronous

point (the cross plotting symbol), and the approximation, Eq. (13) (dashes). Also shown is the

speed of light line (dots).

These results conﬁrm the validity of the analytical approximations for the structure with

small corrugations, provided that the depth of corrugation δ is not small compared to the

corrugation period p. However,

in Ref. [3] it was shown that for the analogous round

structure the corresponding analytical formulas break down when δ becomes small compared

to p: as δ decreases the frequency ﬁrst increases than decreases as compared to the analytical

result; meanwhile the loss factor continually decreases. When δ is small compared to p the

impedance is no longer well characterized by a single resonance, and is best described by

a diﬀerent model [11]. As expected, we ﬁnd the same kind of behavior in our rectangular

structure. If, for example, we reduce δ in our example problem by a factor of 2, we ﬁnd that

the frequency becomes 18% larger, and the loss factor 30% smaller, than the values given

by the analytical formulas.

10

B. Discussion

Our result for the loss factor, Eq. (16), is independent of the depth of corrugation δ, as

was found previously for the analogous cylindrically symmetric problem [3, 10]. This result,

however, is in disagreement with the result of Mostacci et al., where the loss factor was

found to be directly proportional to δ. This discrepancy is important to resolve.

There is a general relation that holds for the wake directly behind the driving particle

W (0+) =

∞

2
π Z

0 R

m
X

eZ(ω) dω = 2

κm ,

(20)

a relation that does not depend on the speciﬁc boundary conditions at the wall. To discuss

it, consider ﬁrst the analogous cylindrically symmetric problem. It was earlier found that,
as long as the corrugations are small and the depth δ >
p, the contribution of one mode
∼
dominates the wake sum. In this case, it was found that, as here, W (0+) (or κ) is independent
of δ [3]. If the corrugations are replaced by a thin dielectric layer, W (0+) does not depend

on the dielectric properties (neither δ nor ǫ) [12]. In the same way, if the corrugations are
replaced by a lossy metal, W (0+) will not depend on the conductivity [13]. And in all three
cases the answer is the same: W (0+) = 4/a2.

[In fact, this relation is also valid for the

(steady-state) wake of a periodic accelerator structure, with a the iris radius [14, 15].]

We expect the same type of behavior to hold in a corrugated, rectangular structure,
i.e. that W (0+) depends only on the cross-section geometry of the beam pipe. In Fig. 5
we plot, for our rectangular structure, a2W (0+)/2 = a2

m κm, as function of πa/w (the

P

2πa/w) (dots). Note that, for πa/w small, many modes

solid curve). Also shown is the contribution of only the ﬁrst (m = 1) term (dashes), and
the approximation 8(πa/w)2 exp(
contribute to the sum; for πa/w >
1, one mode dominates. As with the cylindrically-
∼
symmetric case, W (0+) must still be correct if we replace the corrugated surfaces by thin
dielectric slabs, or by lossy metal plates. We know of no published result for W (0+) in
our rectangular geometry to compare with; nevertheless, Henke and Napoly found W (0+)

our result.

For a given bunch shape and ﬁxed δ/p, as the depth of corrugation δ decreases, we expect

the induced voltage (the convolution of the bunch shape with the wake) to also decrease.

−

If the loss factor does not depend on δ how does this happen? The answer is that as δ

decreases, the mode frequency k increases, and the wake, when convolved with the bunch

shape, will yield an induced voltage that will decrease (at least as fast as 1/k). Concerning

this question, the wake of this structure behaves similarly to the resistive wall wake for very
short bunches as the conductivity increases: W (0+) also does not change but the wake ﬁrst

zero crossing moves closer to s = 0.

IV. CONCLUSION

We studied the impedance of a structure with rectangular, periodic corrugations on two

opposing sides of a rectangular beam tube using the method of ﬁeld matching. We described

a formalism that, for arbitrary corrugation size, can ﬁnd the resonant frequencies k, group

velocities vg, and loss factors κ. In addition, for the case of small corrugations, but where

the depth of corrugation is not small compared to the period, we generated analytical per-

turbation solutions for k, vg, and κ for the dominant mode. We then compared, for such a

structure, the results of the computer program and the analytical formulas, and found good

agreement.

In general, we found that, for the structure of interest, the results are very similar to what

12

was found earlier for a structure consisting of small corrugations on a round beam pipe: if

w

a, where w is the beam pipe width and a is the beam pipe half-height, then one mode

APPENDIX A: EXCITATION OF A SYNCHRONOUS MODE BY A MOVING

RELATIVISTIC POINT CHARGE

Consider ﬁrst a cavity of frequency ω with the electric ﬁeld of an eigenmode E(r)ejωt.

The energy in the eigenmode is denoted by U. If a point charge q passes through the cavity,

it excites this mode to the amplitude As (where As is a complex number), so that after the
passage through the cavity the electric ﬁeld of the mode will be AsE(r)ejωt, and the energy
2U. In quantum language, this is spontaneous radiation

lost by the charge is equal to

As|

|

of the charge into the mode under consideration which is indicated by the subscript s. It is

clear that As is proportional to the charge of the particle q.

To calculate the amplitude As, let us consider a situation when, before the charge enters

the cavity, the latter already has this mode excited by an external agent (RF source) to the

amplitude A0. Due to linearity of Maxwell’s equation, after the passage of the charge, the

ﬁeld in the cavity will be equal to the sum of the initial mode A0 and the spontaneously
2U. The change of the energy ∆W in

0,
then we can neglect the last term on the right hand side of Eq. (A1), which scales as q2,

and keep only the ﬁrst term that is linear in q,

∆W = (AsA0 + c.c.)U .

(A2)

Discarding the term

q2 means that we neglect the beam loading eﬀect.

We can now balance the energy change ∆W with the work done by the external ﬁeld A0

during the passage of the charge. This work is equalt to the integral of the electric ﬁeld

Let us now apply the same approach as above to the excitation of a mode that propagates

with the speed of light in a waveguide. To deal with a mode of ﬁnite energy we consider

a wave packet, and assume that the packet has a length L, as shown in Fig. 6 below. It

propagates in the pipe with the group velocity vg. The energy in the mode U can be related

to the energy ﬂow P (integrated over the cross section averaged over time the Pointing

vector) if we note that U/L is the energy per unit length, and hence (U/L)vg is the energy

ﬂow equal to P , hence

APPENDIX B: FIELD MATCHING, THE GENERAL SOLUTION

also the four equations that need to be matched at the interface y =

1 Introduction

To achieve the small emittance typically required for beam acceleration, a
stored-muon-beam neutrino factory may require transverse ionization cooling
of the muon beam [1,2]. 1 Such cooling can be accomplished by passing the
beam through energy-absorbing material and accelerating structures, both
embedded within a focusing magnetic lattice; the rate of change dǫn/ds of
normalized transverse emittance with path length is then given approximately
by [3,4]

where muon energy Eµ is in GeV, β is the transverse amplitude function of
the lattice evaluated at the location of the absorber, and LR is the radiation
length of the absorber medium.

Simulations show that enough transverse cooling can be achieved to build
a high-performance neutrino factory [2,5]. For example, neglecting Coulomb
scattering (i.e., ignoring the last term in Eq. 1), for typical parameter values
(e.g. ǫn ≈
rad and 200 MeV/c muon momentum) and a 10–15% packing
fraction of absorber within the cooling channel, the cooling rate of Eq. 1 implies
transverse emittance reduction by a factor 1/e in
50 m, about 3% of the
muon decay length. In practice, with β

worse than this because of scattering and other eﬀects [2].

To minimize the eﬀects of Coulomb scattering of the muons as they pass
through the absorber, it has been proposed to use liquid hydrogen (LH2)
as the energy-absorbing medium [6]. Key issues in absorber R&D include

window R&D program is discussed in [7] and [8]. Here we give an overview of
absorber R&D and a summary of recent progress.

2 Absorber development

The heat deposited in the hydrogen by the muon beam can exceed 100 watts
per absorber (Table 1). LH2 targets using an external cooling loop [11] have
been successfully operated in such a heat-deposition regime [12], but engineer-
ing the ﬂuid ﬂow is a challenge [8,13]. We are developing prototypes using two
design approaches [8]: a conventional, “ﬂow-through” (cooling-loop) design,
and a new approach using internal heat exchange, in which driven convection
provides mixing and transverse ﬂow [14].

Fig. 1 shows the mechanical layout of a ﬂow-through absorber. Internal nozzles
will be used to direct the ﬂuid ﬂow within the absorber to ensure adequate
circulation and avoid dead zones or eddies. A room-temperature model with
transparent plastic windows is under construction and will be used for ﬁrst
tests of the nozzle conﬁguration using warm and cold water.

A critical-path item in absorber development is certiﬁcation of safety by a
Fermilab review committee. The stringent standards that must be met have
been codiﬁed in [15] and include destructive testing of ﬁve windows of a given
design before a sixth may be put into service. Pressure testing of a prototype
window is underway [7].

3 Minicooling absorbers

As shown in Table 1, the Feasibilty Study II (FS2) neutrino factory design [2]
includes two large “minicooling” absorbers. Their function is to lower the

muon energy from the optimal energy for capture by the channel’s focusing
optics to that which is considered optimal for cooling. 3 At the same time they
cool the normalized transverse emittance by

√2.

≈

In the FS2 design it is assumed that the minicooling absorbers are composed
of LH2. Such large LH2 tanks with such high power dissipation go considerably
beyond LH2-target experience. However, the parameters are not dissimilar to
those of the Fermilab 15-foot bubble chamber [16].

While LH2 minicooling is surely technically feasible, we have argued [2] that it
is not necessarily the best choice. Minicooling via e.g. solid lithium or beryl-
lium or liquid methane would also be feasible and might well be preferable
from an operational standpoint. The additional multiple scattering entailed
with a higher-Z absorbing material could decrease the ﬂux out of the neu-
trino factory. H. Kirk has simulated this eﬀect and has found the decrease to
be only 5% for lithium and 10% for beryllium [2]. In principle this can eas-
ily be oﬀset by raising the solenoidal focusing ﬁeld slightly, however, detailed
design studies of this idea remain to be carried out.

3 Whether these energies are in fact the optima has not yet been deﬁnitively es-
tablished, but they are the “provisional” optima assumed for the FS2 design.

To support absorber tests, a new experimental area is under construction at
Fermilab. Its location near the end of the Linac makes available 201- and
805-MHz power for high-power RF-cavity tests as well as 400-MeV H − beam
at high intensity. Table 2 gives speciﬁcations of the beam. Our planned pro-
gram includes absorber bench tests and high-power 201-MHz RF-cavity tests
followed by assembly of an integrated prototype cooling cell (including su-
perconducting solenoids) for testing under radiation conditions typical for a
neutrino factory cooling channel. More generally, the Linac-area test facility
is a new experimental area at Fermilab available for any proposed experiment
or test that calls for 400-MeV H − or proton beam.

5 Gaseous absorbers

A new idea has started to receive serious consideration: use of high-pressure
gaseous (rather than liquid) hydrogen as the energy-absorbing medium. If
the gas is allowed to ﬁll the entire cooling channel instead of being conﬁned
to roughly 10% of the channel length (as in current designs), matching the
102 in density
energy loss to the RF accelerating gradient requires a factor
compared to that at STP. The pressure needed, especially if the hydrogen is
cooled to liquid-nitrogen temperature, is then comparable to what has been
used in the past for gaseous Cherenkov counters: about 20 atm.

∼

Upon ﬁrst consideration such an approach would appear to have signiﬁcant
drawbacks. These include the need for thick windows to withstand the pres-
sure as well as the introduction of material inside the RF cavities, which could
cause breakdown and (from Eq. 1) degrade the cooling rate (via multiple scat-
tering at high-beta points of the lattice). However, calculations [17] show that

5

the cooling performance can in fact be enhanced by use of gaseous absorbers:
the many thin windows used in the LH2 case are replaced by only two thick
windows, which degrade the ﬁnal emittance negligibly, and the dense gas in-
side the cavities in fact suppresses breakdown [18]. The recent development of
cooling lattices with constant β [19] alleviates the last of the drawbacks. Fur-
ther potential advantages include a more adiabatic cooling process, in which
the energy loss and acceleration occur continuously and muon momentum
swings are reduced, a slightly shorter overall channel length, which reduces
muon decay losses, and improvement of RF eﬃciency via the decrease of cav-
ity resistivity at low temperature.

A number of questions remain, including whether Paschen’s Law (for high-
voltage breakdown) is applicable in this regime of frequency, gas density, and
radiation level, whether LN2-temperature operation of 201-MHz RF cavities
is indeed more economical when refrigeration costs are factored in, whether
RF couplers can be designed to withstand 20-atm diﬀerential pressure, and
whether constant-β cooling channels (even with gaseous absorber) are cost-
eﬀective compared to other proposed approaches. These will be subjects of
R&D in the coming year.

Abstract

Recent experiments [1] have explored the use of a free-
electron laser (FEL) as a buncher for a microwave two-
beam accelerator, and the subsequent driving of a standing-
wave rf output cavity. Here we present a deeper analysis of
the longitudinal dynamics of the electron bunches as they
are transported from the end of the FEL and through the
output cavity. In particular, we examine the effect of the
transport region and cavity aperture to ﬁlter the bunched
portion of the beam.

INTRODUCTION

Since 1995, free-electron laser (FEL) experiments at the
CEA/CESTA facility have addressed the problem of the
generation of a suitable bunched drive beam for a two-beam
accelerator using linear induction accelerator technology.
In these trials, a 32 period long biﬁlar-helix wiggler is cou-
pled with a 35GHz, 5kW magnetron to provide an effective
FEL interaction with the beam. Early experiments [2], [3]
demonstrated optical diagnostic techniques to show bunch-
ing of the beam at the 35GHz FEL resonant frequency.

In the ﬁrst cavity experiments [1], the induction linac
’PIVAIR’ was utilized, since its design energy of 7.2MeV
is near optimum for a Ka-band two-beam accelerator based
upon the relativistic-klystron mechanism [4]. During op-
eration, PIVAIR delivered a 6.7MeV, 3kA, 60ns (FWHM)
electron beam. The emittance out of the injector is approx-
imately 1000π mm mrad, and the energy spread is less
than 1% (rms) over the pulse length. The full current is
collimated to 830 ± 30A at the FEL entrance. Two 6-
period adiabatic sections are used to inject the beam into
the proper helical trajectory inside the wiggler, and then to
release the beam back into the transport line afterwards.

After the wiggler follows a short transport beamline to
capture and focus the beam through a narrow-aperture (4-
mm ID), 35GHz, single-cell rf output cavity [5]. The beam-
line consists of a section of stainless steel pipe (39mm ID,
1.2m long) with a set of solenoid magnets to provide fo-
cusing through the rf cavity. The rf power generated by
the beam in the cavity is collected and analyzed, while the
beam itself is dumped. This set-up is shown in Figure 1.

∗ The work at LBNL was performed under the auspices of the U.S. De-
partment of Energy by University of California Lawrence Berkeley Na-
tional Laboratory under contract No. AC03-76SF00098.

2 SIMULATION CODES

Two separate numerical simulation codes are used to model
the system behavior. The ﬁrst is the steady-state, 3-D FEL
code, SOLITUDE [6]. The evolution of the FEL mode
power, both as measured and as calculated by SOLITUDE,
is shown (circles and solid line, respectively) in Figure 2.
Also shown is the calculated value of the bunching param-
eter (dashed line) [7]. Not shown is the evolution of the
beam current during transport through the wiggler. Exper-
imentally, the current exiting the wiggler was observed to
be ∼ 250 A. This value was reproduced in the FEL simula-
tions [8].

The RKS code [9] is then used to propagate the beam

from the end of the wiggler through the cavity, and to cal-
culate the interaction of the beam with the rf output struc-
ture. The 6D particle distribution of the beam at the end of
the wiggler, as calculated by SOLITUDE, is used as input to
RKS. The evolution of the beam rms envelopes are shown
in Figure 3. The cavity acts as a collimator, reducing the
beam current, as can be seen in Figure 4. This degree of
current loss was observed experimentally. The calculated
power developed in the rf cavity is also comparable to that
observed experimentally [1].

3 FILTERING AND BUNCH

ENHANCEMENT

The interesting feature to observe in Figure 4, is the discon-
tinuous growth of the bunching parameter, and simultane-
ous current loss, as the beam is partially focused through
the cavity. This is preceded by the gradual loss of cur-
rent, and the gradual increase in the bunching parameter
in the transport region between the end of the wiggler and

exit.

the entrance to the rf cavity. As was pointed out in [1],
the transport line and cavity appear to act as a ﬁlter that
preferentially selects the bunched portion of the beam for
transmission. We seek to analyze this behavior in terms of
the dynamics of the beam in the transport line following the
wiggler.

The longitudinal phase space of the bunches near the
middle of the beam pulse at the exit of the wiggler are
shown in Figure 5. As shown, there is signiﬁcant initial
bunching (b ∼ 0.4) as well as ’tilt’ (energy-phase correla-
tion). The presence of this tilt arises from the fortuitous
extraction of the beam at an appropriate synchrotron oscil-
lation phase in the ’saturated’ regime of the FEL interac-
tion. This tilt contributes to continued bunching in a bal-
listic transport line. The effect of space charge forces upon
debunching are limited by the low current (250 A) and high
kinetic energy (6.7 MeV), and signiﬁcant debunching will
only appear after several meters [10]. This tilt can account
for a modest rise in the bunching parameter, from 0.4 to
∼0.5, as discussed below.

In addition to the energy tilt, the bunches emerging from
the wiggler exhibit nonuniform bunching over the trans-
verse distribution. This is shown in Figure 6. Displayed are
contours of constant bunching parameter as a function of
transverse position. The transverse position coordinate has
been normalized by the appropriate rms transverse beam
size (σx or σy). While the average value of the bunching
parameter is ∼0.4, there is a large degree of variation with
the high-brightness, central core more strongly bunched
than the outlying edges. Collimation of the beam can then
strip away the less-bunched regions, resulting in an overall
enhancement of the average bunching parameter.

The origin of the transverse variation can be related to
the variation of the electromagnetic signal co-propagating
with the beam in the waveguide of the FEL. Optical guid-
ing studies [11] show that both the beam density and the
electromagnetic mode amplitude decrease with increasing

transverse distance from the beam axis. There is, then, a
smaller coupling between the beam and the mode at dis-
tances from the beam axis, with the subsequent decrease in
the forces responsible for bunching.

A series of simulations were performed in which the
beam pipe radius of the transport line between the wiggler
and rf cavity was varied. The purpose of this was to ex-
plore the relative inﬂuence of the two bunching effects de-
scribed above. The results are shown in Figure 7, showing
evolution of beam current and bunching parameter along
the beamline. As shown, the smaller pipes act as collimat-
ing agents, while the larger pipes transmit nearly 100% of
the beam current from the wiggler to the entrance of the
cavity. In the simulations, the smaller beam pipes allowed
the less-bunched portions of the beam to be intercepted,
thereby increasing the average bunching parameter. How-
ever, all simulations demonstrated ballistic bunching due to
the energy-phase tilt. At the end of the transport line lies
the cavity with a 2mm bore radius, which acts as a ﬁnal
collimator and limits drastically the percentage of transmit-
ted current, while also stripping away the unbunched por-

tions from the highly-bunched core. The ﬁnal transverse
distribution of the bunching parameter is shown in Figure
8, taken at the exit plane of the cavity. This distribution
exhibits a broader central plateau with a greater degree of
bunching than seen in Figure 6.

4 CONCLUSIONS

We have presented results of simulations to assist in the
analysis of experimental measurements of current and
bunching transport in a high-frequency, two-beam accel-
erator prototype experiment. We have shown that the aver-
age degree of longitudinal bunching in a beam that exits an
FEL ampliﬁer can be improved by collimation. However,
this may also be accompanied by signiﬁcant loss of current.

Abstract

A conceptual design is presented for a high power cupron-
ickel pion production target.
It forms a circular band in
a horizontal plane with approximate dimensions of: 2.5
meters radius, 6 cm high and 0.6 cm thick. The target is
continuously rotated at 3 m/s to carry heat away from the
production region to a water cooling channel. Bunches of
16 GeV protons with total energies of 270 kJ and repetition
rates of 15 Hz are incident tangentially to an arc of the tar-
get along the symmetry axis of a 20 Tesla solenoidal mag-
netic capture channel. The mechanical layout and cooling
setup are described. Results are presented from realistic
MARS Monte Carlo computer simulations of the pion yield
and energy deposition in the target. ANSYS ﬁnite element
calculations are beginning to give predictions for the resul-
tant shock heating stresses.

INTRODUCTION

High power pion production targets are required in cur-
rent scenarios [1] for muon colliders. The pion secondaries
from protons on the target are captured in a solenoidal mag-
netic channel and decay into the muon bunches needed for
cooling, acceleration and injection into the collider ring.
Bunched proton beams of several megawatts will be needed
for the currently speciﬁed muon currents [1]: approxi-
mately 6 × 1020 muons of each sign at repetition rates of 15
Hertz and in bunches of up to 4 × 1012 muons per bunch.
This is an extrapolation from today’s high power targets in
rate of target heating, shock stresses and integrated radia-
tion damage to the target.

Because of the high beam power, liquid metal jet targets
have been the subject of much recent study and form the
bulk of a proposed experimental R & D program of tar-
getry studies that has recently been submitted [2] to the
BNL AGS Division. More conventional solid targets have
several challenges. Along with concerns about shock heat-
ing stresses and radiation damage, it is challenging to de-
sign a cooling scenario consistent with both the large beam
power and the small target cross sections that are needed

for high pion yields.

This paper introduces the idea of a solid target in the
form of a band that addresses this cooling issue by rotating
the band to carry heat away from the targetry region and
through a cooling channel.

Figures 1 and 2 give schematic views of the targetry
setup we are considering and ﬁgure 3 shows the trajectory
of the proton beam into the target band. It must be empha-
sized that details such as the rollers and cooling setup are
only shown schematically and no effort has been put into
their design.

The target band is enclosed in a 20 Tesla solenoidal mag-
netic pion capture magnet whose general design has previ-
ously been studied [1] by the Muon Collider Collaboration
(MCC). The major design modiﬁcation speciﬁc to this par-
ticular geometry concerns the provision of entry and exit
ports for the target band.

The high-power bunched proton beam strikes the target
band at a glancing angle and travels along inside the tar-
get material for two nuclear interaction lengths before the
curvature of the band brings it again to an exit point at the
outer edge of the band. The beam is tilted at 150 milli-
radians to the longitudinal axis of the solenoidal magnet;
MARS simulations described below show that this gives a
larger pion yield than a beam parallel to the solenoid.

2 MARS SIMULATIONS OF TARGET

HEATING AND PION YIELD

Full MARS [3] tracking and showering Monte Carlo sim-
ulations were conducted for a 16 GeV proton beam of

sipation in the target of 0.324 MW at α=150 mrad.
Contributions to the deposited energy come from dE/dx
from hadrons and muons (44%), electromagnetic shower-
ing (46%) and from absorbtion of sub-threshold particles
(10%). Power dissipation in inner layer of tungsten shield-
ing (7.5<r<15 cm) was also determined, and was found to
be 0.624 MW at α=0 and 0.766 MW at α=150 mrad.

3 ANSYS STRESS SIMULATIONS

The survivability of solid targets in the face of repeated
shock heating is probably the most challenging problem
faced in these scenarios for pion production for muon col-
liders.

To investigate this, we are beginning to conduct ﬁnite
element computer simulations of the shock heating stresses

1×1014 ppp with a repetition rate of 15 Hz on Ni band
(R=250 cm, 6 cm height, 0.6 cm thickness) in a 20 T
solenoid of Ra=7.5 cm half-aperture. Both untilted tar-
gets and targets tilted by α=150 mrad were studied and de-
tailed 3-dimensional maps of energy deposition densities
were generated for input to the ANSYS stress analyses.

The yield per proton at 90 cm downstream from the
central intersection of the beam with the target was de-
termined for pions plus muons in the momentum range
0.05<p<0.8 GeV/c. The yields of positive and negative pi-
ons were, respectively, Y+ = 0.491 and Y− = 0.498 at α=0
and Y+ = 0.622 and Y− = 0.612 at α=150 mrad. Figure 5
shows the momentum spectra for all hadrons and ﬁgure 6
gives more detailed information for the pions. Figure 7
shows the time distribution for when these pions are formed
and ﬁgure 8 shows several scatter plots to illustrate their
distribution in phase space. These pion yields and densities
in phase space are comparably good to the predictions for
the best of the liquid jet targets under consideration.

The peak energy deposition density was found to be
68.6 J/g per pulse, corresponding to a temperature rise
of ∆T =150.5◦C. This corresponded to a total power dis-

using ANSYS, a commercial package that is very widely
used for stress and thermal calculations. These studies are
still at an early stage.

It is encouraging that the instantaneous energy deposi-
tion predicted by MARS of approximately 70 J/g per pro-
ton pulse is much less than the 500-600 J/g depositions
in microsecond timescales that the Fermilab pbar source
nickel target routinely operates at 1. Further, if the pre-
dicted stresses turn out to be higher than, say, 50% of the
target’s tensile strength then possibilities exist for redimen-
sioning the target and the proton spot size to reduce the
stress.

sion, which erroneously referred to temperature rather than energy depo-
sition.

4 CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, initial studies indicate that cupronickel rotat-
ing band targets may well be a viable and attractive option
to satisfy the difﬁcult high power targetry requirements of
muon colliders.

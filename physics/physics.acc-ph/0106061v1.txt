Abstract

Properties of the disrupted NLC beam at the Interaction Point (IP) and particle loss in the
extraction line are analyzed as a function of beam-to-beam position and angular offset at
IP. The simulations show that disruption and beam loss maximize when the vertical beam
separation at IP is about 20 times the rms vertical beam size. The horizontal offset does
not increase the disruption and the beam loss. The angular offsets cause particle loss in the
extraction line mainly because of the beam orbit oscillations.

Abstract

Properties of the disrupted NLC beam at the Interaction
Point (IP) and particle loss in the extraction line are ana-
lyzed as a function of beam-to-beam position and angular
offset at IP. The simulations show that disruption and beam
loss maximize when the vertical beam separation at IP is
about 20 times the rms vertical beam size. The horizontal
offset does not increase the disruption and the beam loss.
The angular offsets cause particle loss in the extraction line
mainly because of the beam orbit oscillations.

INTRODUCTION

In the NLC [1], the strong beam-beam interaction signif-
icantly distorts beam distribution at IP. This effect, called
disruption [2], increases the beam emittance and angu-
lar divergence after collision and generates a huge energy
spread in the outgoing beam. The NLC extraction line
was designed to minimize particle loss caused by these ef-
fects [3, 4].

So far, the NLC beam disruption and extraction line per-
formance were studied for the ideal beam conditions at the
IP. However, various incoming beam errors may affect the
beam-beam interaction and the resultant disrupted distribu-
tion. In this paper, we discuss the effects of beam-to-beam
transverse position and angular offsets at IP on the beam
distribution and particle loss in the extraction line.

Beam-beam effects such as energy loss due to beam-
strahlung occur as particles in each bunch go through the
strong coherent ﬁeld of the other bunch. When the beams
are vertically ﬂat, as they are in NLC, the beamstrahlung
can be enhanced signiﬁcantly for some vertical position
and angle offsets, because the ﬁeld seen by the bulk of
the particles in one beam increases as the offset from the
other beam increases. Of course, the ﬁeld seen by each
beam eventually falls off when position offsets become
large enough. The interaction is further complicated by the
fact that the two beams distort each other’s shape during the
collision. Thus we resort to numerical simulations, where
care must be taken in choosing the grids to perform beam-
beam calculations as accurately as possible.

The beam parameters for the NLC design can be found
in Ref. [1]. In this study, we used the Stage 1 parameters
where the center-of-mass energy is 500 GeV; the IP param-
eters listed in Tables 1 and 2, where ǫ is the beam emittance,
Xrms/Yrms the beam size, and X ′
rms angular diver-
gence in the horizontal and vertical plane, respectively. The
listed parameters are for ideal IP conditions and zero ini-
tial energy spread. The realistic incoming energy spread is

2 SIMULATIONS

In the study, the undisrupted beam parameters in Ta-
bles 1,2 were used as the input data for GUINEA–PIG
code [5] to generate the incoming gaussian beams, simulate
beam-beam interaction and obtain disrupted distribution at
the IP. Some of the disrupted beam parameters for 5×104
particles are shown in Table 2 (after collision), where the
disrupted values of β, α and ǫ were derived from the beam
distribution. The disruption signiﬁcantly increases beam
emittance and angular divergence and generates huge en-
ergy spread with low energy tail up to ∆E

E ∼ −70%.

The disrupted beam was then tracked from IP to the
dump to compute particle loss in the extraction line. Only
the primary beam particles were used in this simulation.
The tracking was performed using the NLC version of DI-
MAD code [6] which correctly accounts for very large en-
ergy errors present in the NLC disrupted beam.

The extraction line optics used in this study is described
in Ref. [4].
It consists of two multi-quadrupole systems
separated by a four bend chicane with 2 cm vertical disper-
sion. The effects of 6 T detector solenoid were included,
but no magnet errors were used.

3 POSITION OFFSET AT IP

To generate disrupted beam distributions for various val-
ues of beam-to-beam offset at IP, the colliding beams were
symmetrically and oppositely displaced at IP by half of the
total offset ± 1
2 ∆y, in the GUINEA–PIG simula-
tions. The resultant distributions with 5×104 particles were
tracked in the extraction line to compute a beam loss.

2 ∆x or ± 1

For ∆x = ∆y = 0, the disrupted parameters are already
given in Table 2. As the beam offset increases, the dis-
rupted distribution should eventually converge to the in-
coming beam distribution since less interaction takes place,
however, at very large offsets the beam loss in the extrac-
tion line may be caused by the large incoming orbit.

A summary of disrupted beam parameters for various
beam offsets at IP are given in Table 3 where σx,y are the
undisrupted rms beam size at IP. One can see that x-offset
gradually reduces the beam disruption, but the y-offset ini-
tially increases the energy spread, the vertical beam size
and the divergence. The disruption maximizes at ∆y ≈15
to 20σy, but the maximums are rather broad as shown in
Fig. 1 and 2. Analysis of distributions in Table 3 shows
that vertical emittance is blown up more than ten times at
∆y = 20σy. A comparison of the energy spread at ∆y = 0,
15σy and 40σy is shown in Fig. 3.

As a result of the increased energy spread and vertical
beam size, one can expect higher beam loss in the extrac-
tion line for ∆y offsets near 15 to 20σy. The results of
particle loss versus y-offset are shown in Fig. 4. The max-
imum loss occurs at ∆y = 20σy and amounts to 0.7 kW of
power loss with 15 lost particles out of 5×104 in tracking.
Some irregularities in Fig. 4 are due to low statistics of the
lost particles. As expected, tracking with the horizontal IP
offsets showed no particle loss.

More detailed analysis of the beam loss with ∆y = 20σy
offset revealed that all of the particles except one were lost
in the vertical plane. This indicates that the blow up of
vertical emittance may be the source of the particle loss.

Our expectation is that the power loss caused by IP off-
set, even at the maximum value of 0.7 kW, can be safely
In practice, the losses should be much lower
disposed.
since the beam offset will be controlled at the level of 1σy
for a maximum luminosity. We expect that with such con-
trol of the vertical offsets the power loss will be on the order
of ∼0.05 kW for the Stage 1 parameters.

4 ANGULAR OFFSET AT IP

Disrupted beam distributions with angular offset at IP
were generated in the GUINEA–PIG code by changing the
2 ∆y′ in the two
nominal initial angle at IP by ± 1
beams. The resultant distributions of 1×105 particles were
then tracked in the extraction line.

2 ∆x′ or ± 1

As in the case of IP position offset, a vertical angular
offset results in somewhat increased beam energy spread
and vertical divergence at IP as shown in Fig. 5 and 6, while
the effect of a horizontal angle is small. Note that angular
offset in Fig. 5 and 6 is normalized to σ′
x,y, the undisrupted
initial divergence at IP. Particle tracking in the extraction
line showed, however, that large offset angles have much
stronger effect on the beam loss than the position offset.
The particle loss versus ∆x′ and ∆y′ is shown in Fig. 7
and 8. The large particle losses are caused by the increased
beam orbit oscillations in the extraction line proportional
to the IP angular offsets.

For a beam power loss below 1 kW at a center-of-mass
energy of 500 GeV, the particle loss needs to be lower than

However, to avoid unnecessary large beam loss, the angu-
lar offsets should be kept well below the above tolerances.

5 CONCLUSION

The beam position and angular offsets at IP may in-
crease the beam disruption. For the Stage 1 (500 GeV cms)
NLC parameters, the beam vertical offset may result in up
to 0.7 kW beam loss in the extraction line.
In practice,
the losses will be much lower for reasonably controlled IP
beam positions. The angular offsets should be kept lower
than 40σ′
y (0.25 mrad) in x and y
planes for a power loss below 1 kW.

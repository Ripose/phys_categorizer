We discuss radiation generated by positrons channeling in a crystalline undulator.
The undulator is produced by periodically bending a single crystal with an ampli-
tude much larger than the interplanar spacing. Diﬀerent approaches for bending
the crystal are described and the restrictions on the parameters of the bending
are established. We present the results of numeric calculations of the spectral dis-
tributions of the spontaneous emitted radiation and estimate the conditions for
stimulated emission. Our investigations show that the proposed mechanism pro-
vides an eﬃcient source for high energy photons, which is worth to be studied
experimentally.

1 Introduction

We discuss a new mechanism, initially proposed in 1,2, for the generation of
high energy photons by means of the planar channeling of ultra-relativistic
positrons through a periodically bent crystal. In this system there appears,
in addition to the well-known channeling radiation, an undulator type radia-
tion due to the periodic motion of the channeling positrons which follow the
bending of the crystallographic planes. The intensity and the characteristic
frequencies of this undulator radiation can be easily varied by changing the
positrons energy and the parameters of the crystal bending.

The mechanism of the photon emission by means of the crystalline undu-
lator is illustrated in Figure 1. It is important to stress that we consider the
case when the amplitude a of the bending is much larger than the interplanar
spacing d (∼ 10−8 cm) of the crystal (a ∼ 10 d), and, simultaneously, is much
less than the period λ of the bending (a ∼ 10−5 . . . 10−4 λ).

In addition to the spontaneous photon emission by the crystalline un-
dulator, the scheme we propose leads to a possibility to generate stimulated
emission. This is due to the fact, that photons emitted at the points of the
maximum curvature of the trajectory travel almost parallel to the beam and

thus, stimulate the photon generation in the vicinity of all successive maxima
and minima of the trajectory.

2 The bent crystal

The bending of the crystal can be achieved either dynamically or statically. In
1,2 it was proposed to use a transverse acoustic wave to dynamically bend the
crystal. The important feature of this scheme is that the time period of the
acoustic wave is much larger than the time of ﬂight τ of a bunch of positrons
through the crystal. Then, on the time scale of τ , the shape of the crystal
bending doesn’t change, so that all particles of the bunch channel inside the
same undulator. One possibility to couple the acoustic waves to the crystal is
to place a piezo sample atop the crystal and to use radio frequency to excite
oscillations.

The usage of a statically and periodically bent crystal was discussed ini-
tially in 1,2 and later in 3. In the latter work the idea to construct a crystalline
undulator based on graded composition strained layers was suggested.

Let us now consider the conditions to be fulﬁled in the stable channeling
regime. The channeling process in a periodically bent crystal takes place if the
maximum centrifugal force in the channel, Fcf ≈ mγc2/Rmin (Rmin being the
minimum curvature radius of the bent channel), is less than the maximal force
due to the interplanar ﬁeld, Fint which is equal to the maximum gradient of

the interplanar ﬁeld (see 2). More speciﬁcally, the ratio C = Fcf /Fint is better
to keep smaller than 0.1, because otherwise the phase volume of channeling
trajectories becomes signiﬁcantly reduced (see also 4). The inequality C <
0.1 connects the energy of the particle, ε = mγc2, the parameters of the
bending (these enter through the quantity Rmin), and the characteristics of
the crystallographic plane.

A particle channeling in a crystal (straight or bent) undergoes scattering
by electrons and nuclei of the crystal. These random collisions lead to a grad-
ual increase of the particle energy associated with the transverse oscillations
in the channel. As a result, the transverse energy at some distance Ld from
the entrance point exceeds the depth of the interplanar potential well, and

the particle leaves the channel. The quantity Ld is called the dechanneling
length 5. To estimate Ld one may follow the method described in 6,7,8. Thus,
to consider the undulator radiation formed in a crystalline undulator, it is
meaningful to assume that the crystal length does not exceed Ld. The de-
tailed numerical analysis of the dechanneling phenomena in periodically bent
crystals and its inﬂuence on the spectral characteristics of the undulator ra-
diation has been performed in 8. An example of these calculations for 5 GeV
positrons channeling along the (110) in Ge crystal is presented in ﬁgure 2 and
in 1. In 8, the similar calculations have been also performed for the Si and
W crystals.

Let us demonstrate how one can estimate, for a given crystal and energy
ε, the ranges of the parameters a and λ which are subject to the conditions
formulated above. For doing this we assume that the shape of the centerline
of the periodically bent crystal is a sin(2π z/λ). Figure 3 illustrates the above
mentioned restrictions in the case of ε = 0.5 GeV positrons planar channeling
in Si along the (110) crystallographic planes. The diagonal straight lines
correspond to various values (as indicated) of the parameter C. The curved

lines correspond to various values (as indicated) of the number of undulator
periods N related to the dechanneling length Ld through N = Ld/λ. The
horizontal lines mark the values of the amplitude equal to d (with d = 1.92 ·
10−8 cm being the (110) interplanar distance in Si) and to 10 d. The vertical
line marks the value λ = 2.335 · 10−3 cm, for which the spectra (see section
3) were calculated.

3 Spectra of the spontaneous emitted radiation

Let us consider the spectra of the spontaneous emitted radiation calculated in
7 using the quasiclassical method 9. In 7 the trajectories of the particles were
calculated numerically and then the spectra were evaluated. The latter include
both radiation mechanisms, the undulator and the channeling radiation.

The spectral distributions of the total radiation emitted in forward di-
rection for ε = 500 MeV positrons channeling in Si along the (110) crys-
tallographic planes are plotted in ﬁgure 4. The wavelength is ﬁxed at
λ = 2.335 · 10−3 cm, while the ratio a/d is changed from 0 to 10. The length
of the crystal is Ld = 3.5 · 10−2 cm and corresponds to N = 15 undulator
periods. The ﬁrst graph in ﬁgure 4 corresponds to the case of the straight

ratios.

channel (a/d = 0) and, hence, presents the spectral dependence of the ordi-
nary channeling radiation only. The spectrum starts at ¯hω ≈ 960 keV, reaches
its maximum value at 1190 keV, and steeply cuts oﬀ at 1200 keV. This peak
corresponds to the radiation into the ﬁrst harmonic of the ordinary channeling
radiation, and there is almost no radiation into higher harmonics. The latter
fact is consistent with general theory of dipole radiation by ultra-relativistic
particles undergoing quasiperiodic motion. The dipole approximation is valid
provided the corresponding undulator parameter pc = 2πγ(ac/λc) is much
less than 1. In this relation ac and λc stand for the characteristic scales of,
correspondingly, the amplitude and the wavelength of the quasiperiodic tra-
jectory. In the case of 0.5 GeV positrons channeled along the (110) planes
in Si one has pc ≈ 0.2 ≪ 1 and all the channeling radiation is concentrated
within some interval in the vicinity of the energy of the ﬁrst harmonic.

Increasing the a/d ratio leads to modiﬁcations in the spectrum of radia-
tion. The changes which occur manifest themselves via three main features,
(i) the lowering of the ordinary channeling radiation peak, (ii) the gradual in-
crease of the intensity of undulator radiation due to the crystal bending, (iii)
the appearing of additional structure (the sub-peaks) in the vicinity of the
ﬁrst harmonic of the ordinary channeling radiation. A more detailed analysis
of these spectra can be found in 7.

4 Discussion of stimulated photon emission

The scheme illustrated by ﬁgure 1 allows to discuss the possibility to gen-
erate stimulated emission of high energy photons by means of a bunch of
ultra-relativistic positrons moving in a periodically bent channel. Indeed the
photons emitted in the nearly forward direction at some maximum or mini-
mum point of the trajectory by a group of particles of the bunch stimulate
the emission of photons with the same energy by another (succeeding) group
of particles of the same bunch when it reaches the next maximum/minimum.
In 2 estimates for the gain factor for the spontaneous emission in crys-
talline undulators were obtained. It was demonstrated that to achieve a total
gain equal to 1 on the scale of the crystal length (equal to the dechanneling
length), one has to consider volume densities n of the channeling positrons on
the level of 1020 . . . 1021 cm−3 for positron energies within the range 0.5 . . . 5
GeV. These magnitudes are high enough to be questioned whether they can
be really reached.

Let us estimate the volume density n of a positron bunch which can be
achieved in modern colliders. To do this we use the data presented in 10
(see p.142) for a beam of 50 GeV positrons available at SLC (SLAC, 1989).
The bunch length is 0.1 cm and the beam radius is 1.5 µm (H) and 0.5
µm (V), resulting in the volume of one bunch V = 2.4 · 10−9 cm3. The
number of particles per bunch is given as 4.0 · 1010. Therefore, one obtains
n = 1.7·1019 cm−3. This value, although being lower by an order of magnitude
than the estimates obtained in 2, shows that the necessary densities should be
reachable in the future with accelerators optimized for high particle densities.
Finally let us discuss the required transverse emittance of the beam. For
doing this we need to consider the angle between the particle’s trajectory
and the crystal plane.
If this angle is larger than the Lindhard angle ΨP,
the particle will not be captured into the channeling mode and leaves the
channel immediately 11. For 5 GeV positrons channeling along the (110)
plane of silicon, we have ΨP = 72 µrad and for 50 GeV positrons it equals to
ΨP = 23 µrad.

One can compare these values with the divergence of the SLC beam,
which transverse emittance in vertical direction is given as 0.05 π rad nm 10.
With a vertical beam radius of 0.5 µm we get for the vertical beam divergence
Ψ = 100 µrad. Thus the divergence of the beam is about four times higher
than the acceptance of the channel and so only a quarter of all particles will
participate in the channeling process. Evidently it is necessary to reduce the
divergence of the beam, for example by increasing the beam radius. But then
it is also necessary to reduce the bunch length, to keep the particle density

high enough. Fortunately, like for the particle density, the values achievable
today diﬀer only about one order of magnitude from the values estimated
above for the stimulated emission.

5 Conclusion

To conclude we point out that the crystalline undulators discussed in this
work can serve as a new eﬃcient source for high energy photons. As we have
shown above, the present technology is nearly suﬃcient to achieve the neces-
sary conditions to constract not only crystalline undulator, but also achieve
the stimulated photon emission regime. The parameters of the crystalline
undulator and the radiation generated with its use diﬀer substantially from
what is possible to achive with the undulators based on magnetic ﬁelds.

In our opinion the eﬀects described above is worth experimental study.
As a ﬁrst step, one may concentrate on measurements of the spontaneous
undulator radiation spectra.

The related problems not discussed in this paper, but which are under con-
sideration, include the investigation of the crystal damage due to the acoustic
wave, photon ﬂux and beam propagations.

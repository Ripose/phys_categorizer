Abstract

The amplitude of Parametric X-ray radiation emitted coherently by a bunch of electrons
crossing a crystal (CPXR) is calculated. When the bunch density is modulated with a
longitudinal period close to the X-ray wavelenght, constructive many-electron interfer-
ences enhance the intensity by Nb × |F (K)|2, where Nb is the number of electrons in the
bunch, F (K) the bunch form factor and K a speciﬁed wave vector. CPXR can be used
to test the microbunching in a X-ray free-electron laser.

1. Introduction

In radiation source using bunches of relativistic electrons, strong enhancement by a many-
electron coherence eﬀect occurs if the bunch is shorter than the emitted wavelength or
if it is modulated with a period close to this wavelength. In the ﬁrst case, the radiation
intensity is proportional to the square of the number Nb of electrons in the bunch, instead
of being linear in Nb. Thus we have enhancement by a factor Nb. In the second case,
one may consider that the “macro” bunch is made of Mb micro-bunches, each having
nb electrons (Nb = Mb · nb). If the microbunches are shorter than the wavelength and
longitudinally separated by λ/v (v is the beam velocity in units c = 1), we expect an
enhancement factor nb for each microbunch, times an enhancement factor Mb coming the
interference between all the microbunches, thus an overall enhancement factor Nb again.
In the general case, the amplitude per bunch is proportional to the Fourier transform
of the spatial charge distribution of the bunch. Thus microbunching (MB) is a way
of obtaining more radiation from a given beam current. It is a basic ingredient of free-
electron lasers (FEL) at optical wavelenght and ”stimulated ampliﬁcation of spontaneous
emission” (SASE) in the X-ray domain (see [1,2] and refs therein). Other potential
applications are coherent transition radiation (CTR) in the microwave [3-5] and X-ray

(CXTR) [6,7] regions, and possibly coherent radiation of particles channeled in crystalline
and nanotube undulators [8-11].

Alternatively, coherent radiations of various types (transition radiation, undulator
radiation, etc) can be used for the measurement of the beam longitudinal structure with
a spatial resolution of the order of λ (see ref.[12]).
In the last years microwave CTR
has been used for the measurement of the MB parameters [3-5]. At future SASE X-ray
FELs [1,2], it would be interesting to have a direct and independent diagnostic of the
MB process. For this purpose, coherent X-ray transition radiation (CXTR) has been
proposed [6,7]. In the present paper we discuss an alternative scheme based on coherent
parametric X-ray radiation (CPXR).

2. Recall about PXR

Parametric X-radiation (PXR) occurs when a charged particle propagates in a crystal.
This radiation is generated by Bragg diﬀraction of the virtual photons composing the
Coulomb ﬁeld of the particle [13].
It is quasi-monochromatic and peaked in a small
angular cone about the specular direction (obtained from the electron direction by sym-
metry with respect to the atomic planes). This direction is at large angle from the electron
beam, thus eliminating the bremsstrahlung background. PXR does not come alone, but
is accompanied by Diﬀracted Transition Radiation (DTR) [14-16] : transition radiation
produced at the entrance surface of the crystal also undergoes Bragg diﬀraction. PXR
and DTR are have similar shapes and usually interfere.

The spectral-angular photon distribution of PXR + DTR having momentum k and

polarization vector ˆe is

where Eq,ˆe∗(r) e−iωt describes a plane wave coming from the detector with momentum
q = −k and polarization ˆe∗, plus its scattered wave. Thus the calculation of the ra-
diation amplitude reduces to an ordinary wave scattering problem. In the kinematical
approximation, the total scattering wave can be decomposed in 5 plane waves :

question will be the main one tackled in this paper.

3. The bunch coherence eﬀect
The phase factor eiΦl is speciﬁc of the lth electron of the bunch. Calling tl and rl the
entrance (resp. exit) time and position for the Bragg (resp. Laue) geometry, we have the
three equivalent expressions

Φl = ωtl + qg · rl = ωtl + q′ · rl = ωtl + q′

0 · rl

(r = 0 is taken on the entrance (resp. exit) surface). Writing the electron trajectory as

r(t) = v t + sl

Φl = K · sl

where sl is the relative position of the electron inside the bunch, we have tl = −(ˆn ·
sl)/(ˆn · v) wherefrom

This momentum K is the one which enters in the bunch form factor. Assuming that all
the electrons of the bunch have the same velocity v and neglecting possible two-body
correlations between them, the bunch coherent intensity is given by

4. Approximations for K

In the pure PXR limit, hg = 0, then K = qg. One can interpret −qg as the momentum of
a virtual photon of the electron Coulomb ﬁeld, which, after Bragg diﬀraction, becomes the
real photon −q going toward the detector. The strongest ampliﬁcation occurs when all
the electrons emit this virtual photon with the same phase factor eiqg·sl, i.e., the electrons
lies on the planes qg · sl = 2nπ + constant. For a more general bunch modulation it is
natural to get the form factor F (q).

For thin or strongly absorbing crystal, the PXR peak at Re(hg) = 0 becomes broad
and less dominant. At large enough γ a DTR peak coming from the 1/h0 term becomes
dominant, although h0 cannot strictly vanish. Then one may neglect h0 in (13) and take
K ≃ q′
0.

At very large γ, we have h0/ω, h′/ω and hg/ω ≪ 1 and we may use equally well qg,

q′ or q′

0 as argument of the form factor.

Note that in backward coherent transition radiation the argument of the bunch form
0 is the momentum of a photon coming from

0 + h0/(ˆn · v) ˆn, where q′

factor is also K = q′
the detector after reﬂection by the surface.

5. Discussion

We have shown that, in principle, bunch coherence can be obtained in PXR (+ DTR) as
well as, for instance, in transition radiation, and have speciﬁed the relevant bunch form
factor. This phenomenon can be applied to the diagnostic of micro-bunching or to the
enhancement of a PXR source. This is diﬀerent from the (much more ambitious) goal
of building a PXR Free Electron Lasers [19], which should operate with long pulses of
extremely high densities (108 − 109 A/cm2).

The advantages of PXR-DTR are (i) there is no need for a monochromator (ii) photons
are emitted at large angle from the beam. These make the device more compact. Two
diﬃculties might be encountered :
- in MB diagnostics, the bunch may be accompanied by X-rays coming from the undulator
which makes the micro-bunching. These X-rays will be Bragg-reﬂected by the PXR
radiator and can make a large background. It may possible to eliminate these X-rays by
if the Bragg angle is 45 degrees
a magnetic chicane or using their linear polarization :
and the atomic planes perpendicular to the undulator plane, the reﬂection coeﬃcient for
the undulator X-rays vanishes.
- K makes the angle θ ∼ γ−1 with the beam.
If the bunch is modulated only in the
longitudinal coordinate and has a transverse size rT larger than λ/θ, then its form factor
is strongly reduced. If one lowers θ too much, the P XR + DT R intensity vanishes like
θ2 (the same problem occurs with bunch-coherent transition radiation).
It should be
however possible to avoid this damping by making the spatial modulation of the bunch
oblique, the planes of maximum density being orthogonal to K and not to the velocity.
The necessary tilt of these planes could be obtained by deﬂecting the beam at the angle
−θ using an upstream magnet.

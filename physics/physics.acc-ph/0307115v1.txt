ABSTRACT

Main parameters of future lepton-hadron colliders are estimated. Namely, THERA
and Linac*LHC based ep, γp, eA, γA and FELγA colliders are considered. The
physics search potential of these machines are considered.

1 Introduction

It is known that lepton-hadron collisions have been playing a crucial role in explo-
ration of deep inside of matter. Today, THERA (TESLA on HERA) and Linac*LHC
can be considered as realistic candidates for future lepton-hadron and photon hadron
colliders. We discuss the main parameters and physics search potential of the lepton-
hadron colliders and draw the attention of the high energy and nuclear physics
communities to future ep, eA, γp, γA and FEL γA collider facilities.

2 TESLA*HERA Based Lepton-Hadron Colliders

It is known that the TESLA Collider will be a powerful tool for exploraiton of the
multi-hundred GeV scale [1]. Taking into account the possible polarized proton and
nucleus options for HERA will provide a number of additional opportunities to in-
vestigate lepton-hadron and photon hadron interactions at TeV scale. Recently, the

HERA based ep, γp, eA and
work on TESLA TDR has been ﬁnished, and TESLA
γA colliders are included into TESLA project. Main parameters of TESLA
HERA
⊗
1030 cm−2s−1
based ep collider are given in [2]. It is seen that one has Lep = 4.1
with Ee = 250 GeV and Ep = 1 T eV . Also two additional versions (Ee = Ep = 500
1031
GeV with Lep = 2.5
cm−2s−1) have been mentioned in TESLA TDR. In principle, TESLA
HERA based
ep collider will extend the HERA kinematics region by an order in both Q2 and x
and, therefore, the parton saturation regime can be achieved. Main parameters
and physics search potential of THERA based γp collider are given in [3, 4]. Main
limitations for eA option comes from fast emittance growth of nucleus beam due
to intra-beam scattering. In our opinion γA option is the most promising option
of TESLA
HERA complex, because it will give unique opportunity to investigate
small xg region in nuclear medium. Colliding of TESLA FEL beam with nucleus
bunches from HERA may give a unique possibility to investigate ”old” nuclear
phenomena in rather unusual conditions. The main idea is very simple [5]: ultra-
relativistic ions will see laser photons with energy ωo as a beam of photons with
energy 2γAωo , where γA is the Lorentz factor of the ion beam. The region 0.1
10
MeV, which is matter of interest for nuclear spectroscopy, corresponds to 0.1
10
keV lasers, which coincide with the energy region of TESLA FEL.

The center-of-mass energies which will be achieved at diﬀerent options of this ma-
chine [6] are an order larger than those at HERA are and
3 times larger than the
HERA. Center-of-mass energy and luminosity for this op-
energy region of TESLA
1031 cm−2s−1. This machine, which will extend
tion are √s = 5.29 TeV and Lep = 8
both the Q2-range and x-range by more than two order of magnitude comparing to
those explored by HERA, has a strong potential for both standard model and new
physics research. Using γp option of this collider thousands di-jets with pt > 500
GeV and hundreds thousands single W bosons will be produced, hundred millions of
bb- and cc- pairs will give opportunity to explore the region of extremely small xg
etc. Details on main parameters and physics search potential of Linac*LHC based
eA, γA and FEL γA coliders can be found in [4, 6]. The CLIC, an electron-positron
collider with √s = 3 T eV and Lee = 1035 cm−2s−1, is considered as one of the future
options for post-LHC era at CERN. The work on CLIC*LHC based ep, γp, eA, γA
and FEL γA options is under progress.

4 Conclusions

It seems that neither HERA nor LHC
LEP will be the end points for lepton-hadron
colliders. We see that TeV scale linac-ring type ep machines will give an opportunity
to go far in this direction (see Table 1). In addition, more knowledge on the subject
can be found in [7].

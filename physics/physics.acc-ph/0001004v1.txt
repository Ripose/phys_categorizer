Abstract

The new method for producing of the polarized relativistic positrons is suggested.
A beam of unpolarized positrons accelerated up to a few GeV can be polarized
during a head-on collision with an intense circularly polarized lazer wave. After a
multiple Compton backscattering process the initial positrons may lose a substantial
part of its energy and, as consequence, may acquire the signiﬁcant longitudinal
polarization. The simple formulas for the ﬁnal positron energy and polarization
degree depended on the laser ﬂash parameters have been obtained. The comparison
of eﬃciences for the suggested technique and known ones is carried out. Some
advantages of the new method were shown.

The experiments with polarized electron-positron beams in future linear colliders will
furnish a means for studying a number of intriguing physical problems [1]. While the
problem of generation and acceleration of longitudinally polarized electron beams seems
to be solved [2], the approach for production of polarized positron beams with the required
parameters has not been ﬁnally deﬁned yet.
In [3-7] methods were proposed for the
generation of longitudinally polarized positrons during e+e−– pair production by circularly
polarized photons with the energy ω ∼ 101 MeV, which are, in their turn, generated by
either passing electrons with the energy ∼ 102 GeV through a helical undulator [3],
or through Compton backscattering of circularly polarized laser photons on a beam of
electrons with the energy ∼5 GeV [4,5], or through bremsstrahlung of longitudinally
polarized ∼50 MeV electrons [6,7]. To achieve the needed intensity of a positron source
,pol ∼ 1010 particles/bunch) it is suggested to use an undulator of the length L > 100
(Ne+
m [8], or to increase the laser power [9], or to use a high-current accelerator of polarized
electrons [10].

The present paper considers an alternative way to approach this problem.
A beam of unpolarized positrons from a conventional source being cooled in a damping
ring and preliminary accelerated to an energy E0 can be polarized during a head-on-
collision with a high-intensity circularly polarized laser wave.

It is well known that during Compton backscattering of circularly polarized laser pho-
tons on unpolarized positrons (electrons) with the energy E0 ∼100 GeV the scattered
photon takes up to 90% of the initial positron energy while the recoil positron aquires
∼ 100% longitudinal polarization [11,12]. At E0 ≤10 GeV, however, the positron loses
too little of its energy during single Compton backscattering (a few percent), and the lon-
gitudinal polarization of the recoil positron is, therefore, of the same order of magnitude.
Current advances of laser physics make it possible to obtain parameters of laser ﬂash such

1

that the positron successively interacts with N ≫ 1 identical circularly polarized photons.
It is apparent that in this case the positron can lose a substantial fraction of its energy
(comparable with E0). To evaluate the resulting polarization of the recoil positron, let us
consider multiple Compton backscattering in greater detail.

Let us carry out calculations in a positron rest frame (PRF) and in a laboratory frame
(LF). Following [13], let us write the Compton scattering cross section in PRF where
spin correlations of three particles will be viewed– initial photon, and initial and recoil
positrons (upon summation over the scattered photon polarizations):

k0

(cid:17)2nΦ0 + Φ2(Pc, ~ξ0) + Φ2(Pc, ~ξ) + Φ2(~ξ0, ~ξ) + Φ3(Pc, ~ξ0, ~ξ)o

(1)

Here r0 is the electron classical radius; k0, k are the initial and scattered photon energy;
Pc = ± 1 is the circular polarization of the initial photon; and ~ξ0, ~ξ are the spin vectors
of the initial and ﬁnal positrons. Functions Φ0, Φ2, Φ3 were obtained in paper [13].

In (1) and further in the paper use is made of the system of units ¯h = me = c = 1,

unless otherwise indicated.

Since the scattered photons are not detected, the cross section (1) has to be integrated
over the photon outgoing angles. Due to azymuthal symmetry, it will depend on the
average longitudinal polarization components ξ0l, ξl solely. On this basis we will keep
only these components which remain the same in LF.

For positrons with γ0 ≤ 104 (γ0 is the Lorentz-factor of the initial positron), the laser

photon energy in PRF ( ω0 ∼1 eV in LF ) will satisfy the relation

Using (2) let us write the expression for the scattered photon energy in PRF:

k0 = 2γ0 ω0 ≪1

k =

k0

1 + k0(1 − cos θ)

≈ k0[1 − k0(1 − cos θ)]

(2)

(3)

Here θ is the polar angle of the scattered photon in PRF.

Leaving the terms not higher than k2

0 , let us write in explicit form the Φi functions

derived in [13] for electrons :

Φ0 =

It is obvious that in averaging with respect to the initial particles spin and taking the
summation with respect to two spin states of the recoil positron, instead of (5) we get
Klein-Nishina’s cross section for k0 ≪ 1 [11]:

σ =

From (5) follows that longitudinal polarization of a recoil positron (electron) is deter-
mined by both its initial polarization and the circular polarization of a photon (later the
longitudinal polarization indices l will be omitted):

If the initial positron is unpolarized (ξ0 = 0), then upon a single interaction with a

laser photon the recoil positron becames polarized :

|ξ(1)| = |

(8)

In order to consider the next scattering act, let us calculate the average longitudinal
momentum < kk > along the initial photon direction and the average energy < k > of
the scattered photon in PRF using the same approximation as before:

Thus, upon the ﬁrst event of interaction, the photon in LF aquires, on average, the energy

(10)

In (10) β0 = 1 −

It is apparent that the recoil positron loses its energy (10) and hence

γ(1) = γ0− < ωsc >= γ0(1 − k0) = γ0(1 − 2γ0ω0) .

(11)

In PRF before the second interaction the initial photon, in view of (11), will have a lower
energy

k(1) = 2γ(1)ω0 = 2γ0ω0(1 − 2γ0ω0) = k0(1 − k0) ,

(12)

and the recoil positron will have a polarization:

(14)

It follows from (14) that as a result of multiple Compton backscattering the longitudinal
polarization of positrons builds up, while their energy decreases in LF (so-called laser
cooling, see [14, 15]).

Let us write expressions relating the polarization and energy for two subsequent acts

of scattering:

γ(i+1) = γ(i)(1 − 2ω0γ(i)) ,

ξ(i+1) =

ξ(i) − γ(i)ω0Pc
1 − γ(i)ω0PCξ(i)

.

From these we can obtain the equations for the ﬁnite diﬀerences:

∆γ(i) = γ(i+1) − γ(i) = 2ω0γ2

(i) ,

∆ξ(i) = ξ(i+1) − ξ(i) ≈ −ω0Pcγ(i)(1 − ξ2

(i)) .

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

When N ≫1, instead of (17) and (18) we can arrive at diﬀerential equations, whose
solution with proper initial conditions will yield

γ(N) =

γ0

1 + 2γ0ω0N

ξ(N) =

γ0ω0N

1 + γ0ω0N

.

(19)

(20)

When deriving the above relation, there was taken the left circular polarization Pc = −1
for the sake of simplicity.

Equations (19) and (20) describe the positron characteristics after N collisions with
circularly polarized laser photons. The number of collisions N is controlled by the lumi-
nosity of the process L:

(21)

In (21) N0 = A/ω0 is the number of photons per laser ﬂash, A is the laser energy, and
σph, σe+, are the laser focus and positron bunch radii. We can expect that after cooling in
the damping ring σe+ ≪ σph. In this case, substituting (21) into (19) and (20), we obtain
the following simple formulas for positron’s characteristics:

γ(N) =

which depend on the dimensionless parameter µ solely

(23)

(24)

.

It follows from (24) that the µ parameter depends linearly on the laser ﬂash energy and
the initial positron energy, but it is inversely proportional to the laser focus area and does
not depend on the interaction time (duration ﬂash). Having written (22) as:

γ0
γ(N)

= 1 + 2 µ ,

(25)

we will compare the result with the estimate by V. Telnov [15] obtained in a classical
approximation. Substituting into (24) the estimate used in [15] σ2
laser photon wavelength and le is the positron bunch length), we get :

(26)

The resulting expression is closed to a similar one in [15] but the second term in (26)
is by a factor of π smaller. This dicrepancy is connected with rough calculation of the
luminosity (constant area of the laser focus) used in (21).

By way of illustration let us consider an example (see [15]):

γ0 = 104, A = 5 J, λ0 = 500 nm, le = 0.2 mm, σ2

ph = λ0le/8π .

(27)

In this case µ= 1.6 and, therefore, γ(N) ≈ 0.3γ0; ξl ≈ 60%.

5

Thus, when a positron bunch interacts with a laser ﬂash of the given parameters, all the
positrons acquire longitudinal polarization of about 60%. The change in the polarization
sign is obtained by inverting the sign of the circular polarization of laser radiation.

It should be noted that with a proper selection of the sign of circular polarization,
the process of laser cooling would give rise to a longitudinal polarization increase of the
electrons rather than to depolarization of electrons beam (as in the case of unpolarized
laser radiation considered in [15]).

Note that, generally speaking, the laser parameters (27) correspond to the so-called
”strong” ﬁeld, when the contribution from non-linear Compton scattering [4] would be
considerably high.

Non-linear processes, i.e., simultaneous scattering of a few laser photons on the moving
positron, are characterized by an increase in the eﬀective positron mass in PRF, which,
in its turn, leads to a decrease in the Lorentz-factor and the energy transferred to the
positron through scattering. It is to be expected that the µ parameter (24) for a ﬁxed
value of the laser ﬂash energy A will be suﬃciently lower for a non-linear case as compared
to the linear one, and hence a lower attainable polarization (23).

In order to reach a linear mode of the Compton scattering process, one has to stretch
the laser ﬂash (the length of its interaction with the positron bunch) (see, for instance,
[16]).

In conclusion, let us estimate the energy A+,pol necessary to obtain one polarized
positron with the energy E+ > 101 MeV and the longitudinal polarization ξl > 0,5 i.e.,
the parameters acceptable for consequent acceleration.

i) According to the estimates [8] an electron with the energy E− ∼ 200 GeV passing
through a helical undulator of the length L ∼ 150 m can generate a number of circu-
larly polarized photons needed to obtain one polarized positron to be later accelerated
(conversion eﬃciency η = Ne+

,pol/Ne− ≈1). Hence, A+,pol∼E−/η = 200 GeV.

ii) The author of the paper [9] considered a scheme for production of ∼ Ne+ = 109
polarized positrons when the laser radiation of the total energy AΣ ∼ 20 J is scattered on
an electron bunch with E− = 5 GeV and Ne− = 1010e− / bunch. Thus

A+,pol ≈

Ne−E− + AΣ

Ne+

≈ 170 GeV .

iii) In [6] the author estimated the conversion eﬃciency for longitudinally polarized

electrons with the energy E− = 50 MeV:

η ≈ 10−3 .

Therefore A+,pol ∼ E−/η = 50 GeV.

iv) For the method suggested in the present paper, evaluation of A+,pol can be made

for parameters of the unpolarized positron source used in SLAC [17].

The conversion eﬃciency for the electron energy E− = 33 GeV equals:

η ≈1 .

6

Therefore, for a bunch with Ne+ = 1010 and the positron energy E0 = 5 GeV interacting
with the laser ﬂash (A = 5 J) we have:

A+,pol =

E−
η

+ E0 +

A
Ne+

= 33 GeV + 5 GeV + 3 GeV ∼ 40 GeV .

Thus, the scheme proposed here seems to be most energy eﬀective.

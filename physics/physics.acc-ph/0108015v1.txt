Non-linearities and Eﬀects of Transverse Beam Size in Beam Position Monitors

Sergey S. Kurennoy
Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545, USA

The ﬁelds produced by a long beam with a given trans-
verse charge distribution in a homogeneous vacuum chamber
are studied. Signals induced by a displaced ﬁnite-size beam
on electrodes of a beam position monitor (BPM) are calcu-
lated and compared to those produced by a pencil beam. The
non-linearities and corrections to BPM signals due to a ﬁnite
transverse beam size are calculated for an arbitrary chamber
cross section. Simple analytical expressions are given for a
few particular transverse distributions of the beam current in
a circular or rectangular chamber. Of particular interest is
a general proof that in an arbitrary homogeneous chamber
the beam-size corrections vanish for any axisymmetric beam
current distribution.

I. INTRODUCTION

In many accelerators, especially in ion linacs and stor-
age rings, beams occupy a signiﬁcant fraction of the vac-
uum chamber cross section. On the other hand, an anal-
ysis of beam-induced signals in beam position monitors
(BPMs) is usually restricted to the case of an inﬁnitely
small beam cross section (pencil beam).
In this paper
we consider the problem for a vacuum chamber with an
arbitrary but constant cross section, and calculate, for
a given transverse charge distribution of an oﬀ-axis rel-
ativistic beam, the ﬁelds produced by the beam on the
chamber wall. Comparing those with the ﬁelds of a pen-
cil beam gives us corrections (e.g., to BPM signals) due
to a ﬁnite transverse size of the beam.

Let a vacuum chamber have an arbitrary single-
connected cross section S that does not change as a beam
moves along the chamber axis z, and perfectly conduct-
ing walls. We consider the case of (ωb/βγc)2
1, where
ω is the frequency of interest, βc is the beam velocity,
β2, and b is a typical transverse dimension of
γ = 1/
the vacuum chamber. It includes both the ultra relativis-
1, and the long-wavelength limit when, for
tic limit, γ
a ﬁxed γ, the wavelength of interest λ
2πb/γ. Under
these assumptions the problem of calculating the beam
ﬁelds at the chamber walls is reduced to a 2-D electro-
static problem of ﬁnding the ﬁeld of the transverse distri-
bution λ(~r) of the beam charge, which occupies region Sb
of the beam cross section, on the boundary ∂S of region
S, see e.g. [1]. The layout of the problem is illustrated in
Fig. 1.

Let the beam charge distribution λ(~r) satisfy the nor-
Sb d~rλ(~r) = 1, which means the
malization condition
unit charge per unit length of the bunch. If we know the

ﬁeld e(~r,~b) produced at a point ~b on the wall by a pencil
beam located at a point ~r of region Sb, the ﬁeld of the
distribution is given by

E(~a,~b) =

d~rλ(~r)e(~r,~b) ,

where the vector ~a is deﬁned as the center of the charge
distribution: ~a =
d~r~rλ(~r). Obviously, the case of a
pencil beam corresponds to the distribution λ(~r) = δ(~r
−
~a), where δ(~r) is the 2-D δ-function. Let us start from a
particular case of a circular cylindrical vacuum chamber.

— assuming, of course, that the rms beam sizes are small,
b, — one obtains non-linearities in the form of
σx, σy ≪
powers of ax, ay, as well as the beam size corrections,
which come as powers of σx, σy. To our knowledge, this
was done ﬁrst for the double-Gaussian beam in a circular
pipe by R.H. Miller et al in the 1983 paper [2], where
the expansion was calculated up to the 3rd order terms.
More recently, their results have been used at LANL in
measuring second-order beam moments with BPMs and
calculating the beam emittance from the measurements

[3].
In a recent series of papers [4] by CERN authors,
the results [2] have been recalculated (and corrected in
the 3rd order), and used to derive the beam size from
measurements with movable BPMs.

In fact, integrating (2) with the distribution (3) can
be readily carried out up to an arbitrary order. Using in
Eq. (2) the binomial expansion for

The multipole expansion (5) that includes terms up to
the decapole ones, leads us to one interesting observa-
tion: all beam-size corrections come in the form of the
σ2
diﬀerence σ2
y, and vanish for a round beam where
x = σ2
σ2
y. This would be obvious for an on-axis beam in a
round pipe from the Gauss law, but for a deﬂected beam
the result seems rather remarkable.

x −

It is not easy to see directly from Eq. (4) whether
the beam-size corrections for a round beam in a round
pipe vanish in all orders. However, one can check ex-
plicitly that it is the case. Let us consider an arbi-
trary azimuthally symmetric distribution of the beam
charge ˜λ(~r) = ˜λ(r), where the tilde in ˜λ means that
the argument of the distribution function λ is shifted so
that the vector ~r now originates from the beam center:
λ(~a + ~r) = ˜λ(~r).

In this case, the integration in Eq. (1) for the circular
pipe can be done explicitly. Namely, using the expansion
in (2) and integrating in polar coordinates (r, ϕ), for the
case when ˜λ(r, ϕ) = ˜λ(r) one can write

The last expression follows from the preceding one due
to the charge normalization, and it is exactly the ﬁeld
of a pencil beam displaced from the chamber axis by
~a = (a, 0), compare Eq. (2). The only real eﬀort here was
to perform the angular integration, which turns out to be
independent of r. It was done analytically by introducing
a new complex variable z: cos ϕ = (z + z−1)/2, and then
integrating along a unit circle in the complex z-plane with
residues1.

Now we apply the above results for calculating signals
in a BPM. First of all, we will assume that signals in-
duced in BPM electrodes (striplines or buttons) are pro-
portional to the wall image current integrated within the
transverse extent of the electrode on the chamber wall.
Such an assumption is usually made in analytical treat-
ments of BPM signals, see e.g. [1,2,4,5], and is justiﬁed
when the BPM electrodes are ﬂush with the chamber
walls, grounded, and separated from the wall by narrow
gaps. Certainly, there are some ﬁeld distortions due to
the presence of the gaps, but they are rather small for
narrow gaps. Moreover, even for a more complicated
BPM geometry with realistic striplines protruding inside
a circular pipe, it was demonstrated by measurements
(see in [5]) and by numerical 3-D modeling [6] that the
eﬀects of ﬁeld distortions near the stripline edges can
be accounted for by integrating the wall current within
an eﬀective transverse extent of the striplines (slightly
larger than their width) in a simple smooth-pipe model
with the eﬀective pipe radius taken to be an average of
the stripline inner radius and that of the beam pipe.

Consider now in a circular chamber of radius b a
stripline BPM with a pair of electrodes in the horizon-
tal plane. Let us assume that the stripline electrodes

ticular kind of integrals. Wolfram Research acknowledged the

are ﬂush with the chamber walls, grounded, and have
subtended angle φ per stripline. Following the discus-
sion above, we neglect the ﬁeld distortions near the strip
edges, and calculate the signals induced on the stripline
electrodes by integrating the ﬁeld (5) over the interval
φ/2 for the right electrode (R) and over
−
π + φ/2 for the left one (L). The ratio of

The factor outside the brackets in the RHS of Eq. (7) is
the linear part of the BPM response, so that all terms in
the brackets except 1 are non-linearities and beam-size
corrections.

Corrections (7) are shown in Figs. 2-5 for a 60◦ stripline
BPM. Figure 2 shows the non-linearities of the BPM
response for a pencil beam. The signal ratio changes
are noticeable when Figs. 3-4 for ﬂat beams are com-
pared with Fig. 1.
In Fig. 5 the ratio S/S0, where
L)/(R + L) for a ﬁnite-size beam, and S0 is
S = (R
the same diﬀerence-over-sum ratio but for a pencil beam,
is plotted versus the beam center position. One can see
from Fig. 5 that for a reasonable transverse beam size the
beam-size corrections are on the level of a few percents.

III. VACUUM CHAMBER OF ARBITRARY

Let us consider now a more general case of a ho-
mogeneous vacuum chamber with an arbitrary single-
connected cross section S. The ﬁeld e(~r,~b) produced by
a pencil beam at a point ~b on the wall can be written as

Now it is quite obvious that if one assumes an arbi-
trary azimuthally symmetric distribution of the beam
charge ˜λ(~r) = ˜λ(r), i.e. ˜λ(r, ϕ) = ˜λ(r), all beam moments
(17) become equal to zero after the angular integration,
and the corresponding beam-size corrections in (15) van-
ish. Therefore, we proved a rather general statement:
the ﬁelds produced by an ultra relativistic beam with an
azimuthally-symmetric charge distribution on the walls
of a homogeneous vacuum chamber of an arbitrary cross
section are exactly the same as those due to a pencil beam
of the same current following the same path. A particular
case of this statement, for a circular chamber cross sec-
tion, was proved by explicit calculations earlier, in Sect.
II.

The physical explanation of this eﬀect is simple. The
electric ﬁeld outside the beam ~E is a superposition of
the ﬁeld due to the charge distribution itself, ~Edis
vac, and
the ﬁeld due to induced charges on the chamber walls,
~Eind. From the Gauss law, for an azimuthally-symmetric

beam charge distribution, the ﬁeld ~Edis
vac outside the beam
(in vacuum, without the chamber) is exactly the same
as that of a pencil beam, ~E0
vac, if the last one has the
same charge and travels along the axis of the thick beam.
Therefore, the induced charge distribution on the wall
will be identical for the thick and pencil beams, and as
a result the same will be true for the total electric ﬁeld
outside the beam2.

The expansion (15) for symmetric distributions of the
beam charge gives the beam-size corrections for an arbi-
trary chamber, as long as the beam charge distribution
is known. As two particular symmetric charge distribu-
tions of practical interest, we consider a double Gaussian
one, cf. Eq. (3),

One can see that for a round beam, σx = σy, all cor-
rections in (20) disappear as expected, and for a square
beam cross section in (20), the lowest correction is pro-
portional to σ4, while the next-order one to σ8.

One should note at this point that the general ﬁeld
expansion (15) and Eqs. (20-21) derived above are essen-
tially the expansions in a small parameter σ2/b2, where
σ is a typical transverse beam size, and b stands for a
characteristic transverse dimension of the chamber cross
section. The powers of 1/b are produced by the deriva-
tives of the pencil beam ﬁeld e(~a,~b) in Eqs. (15) and
(20-21). Therefore, these results are valid for any beam
oﬀset a, large or small, no matter what is the relation
between σ and a.

Equations (15) and (20-21) give us a rather good idea
about how the beam-size corrections enter into the ﬁeld
expressions. The non-linearities, however, are hidden in
the pencil-beam ﬁeld e(~a,~b) and in its derivatives. We
can single out the non-linearities in a way similar to the
one used to obtain the beam-size corrections, by expand-
ing the ﬁeld e(~a,~b) in powers of a around the chamber
axis:

where the notation e0 = e(0,~b) was introduced for
brevity, and similarly for the derivatives.
In the most
general case, unfortunately, it does not lead to conve-
nient equations. However, for vacuum chambers with
some symmetry the results can be simpliﬁed signiﬁcantly.
Here we limit our consideration to the case of region S
that is symmetric with respect to its vertical and hori-
zontal axis. If a pair of narrow BPM electrodes is placed
on the walls in the horizontal plane of such 2-axis sym-
metric chamber, the ﬁelds due to a pencil beam at lo-
cation ~a = (x0, y0) on the right (R) and left (L) elec-

Eq. (15). It still takes some eﬀort to arrive to the par-
ticular case of Eq. (22) for the circular pipe, Eq. (7), but
the structure of corrections is rather clear.

We conclude our study of the general case with a re-
mark that the pencil beam ﬁeld e(~a,~b) and its derivatives
are generally not easy to calculate, except for a few par-
ticular cases. For a circular pipe we know the explicit
expression (2) for e(~a,~b). Another case where the eigen-
functions are simple and the sums in Eqs. (15) and (22)
can be worked out relatively easy, is a rectangular cham-
ber.

IV. RECTANGULAR CHAMBER

tion S having a rectangular shape with width w and
height h. The orthonormalized eigenfunctions of the

Obviously, for an axisymmetric beam with σx = σy the
argument of the exponent vanishes, and the exponent is
equal to unity. As a result, the ﬁeld (24) of a ﬁnite-size
axisymmetric beam will be exactly equal to that of a
pencil beam, Eq. (23).

For the uniform rectangular distribution (19), the
form-factors are f (z) = sin(z)/z, F (z) = sinh(z)/z, and
the resulting correction factor is

Expanding this expression in powers of σ leads to the con-
clusion that the lowest beam-size corrections here have
the order of σ4, as we already know from Sect. III.

As for BPM signals, the simplest way is to use the
general result (22). For two stripline BPM electrodes of
width h1 on side walls of a rectangular vacuum chamber

for n = 0, 1, 2, . . .. The sums above include one more
form-factor, Φ(z) = sin z/z, that accounts for the BPM
h, it
electrode width. For narrow electrodes, when h1 ≪
tends to 1.

Corrections (25) are shown in Figs. 6-9 for a square
chamber, w = h, and a BPM with very narrow electrodes,
h1 = h/100 (in fact, results for h1 = h/10 are almost
identical). Figure 6 shows only the non-linearities, which
in this case are practically the same for three diﬀerent
vertical beam oﬀsets. On the contrary, the beam-size
corrections here depend noticeably on the beam vertical

oﬀset, and range from about +3% for y = 0 (the chamber
mid-plane) to less than 1% for y = h/8 to about -(9-12)%
for y = h/4 (the beam is half-way to the top wall), in the
case of σx/w = 0.1, σy/h = 0.05 shown in Fig. 9. Similar
to Fig. 5, in Fig. 9 S = (R
L)/(R + L) for a ﬁnite-size
−
beam, and S0 is the same ratio for a pencil beam, which
is plotted in Fig. 6. Therefore, S/S0 = 1 in Fig. 9 means
that there are no corrections due to a ﬁnite transverse
beam size. Again, as in the circular chamber, the beam
size corrections for ﬂat beams can be rather signiﬁcant,
as we see from comparison of Figs. 7-8 with Fig. 6.

V. CONCLUSIONS

Non-linearities and corrections due to a ﬁnite trans-
verse beam size in beam ﬁelds and BPM signals are cal-
culated for a homogeneous vacuum chamber in the case
when either the wavelength of interest is longer than a
typical transverse dimension of the chamber and/or the
beam is ultra relativistic.

A general proof is presented that transverse beam-size
corrections vanish in all orders for any azimuthally sym-
metric beam in an arbitrary chamber. One should em-
phasize that non-linearities are still present in this case;
for a given chamber cross section, they depend only on
the displacement of the beam center from the cham-
ber axis. However, the non-linearities are the same for
a ﬁnite-size axisymmetric beam and for a pencil beam
(line source) with the same displacement. Having a non-
symmetric transverse distribution of the beam charge
results in additional (properly beam-size) corrections.
They tend to be minimal when the beam charge distri-
bution is more symmetric.

Explicit analytical expressions are derived for two par-
ticular cases — circular and rectangular chamber cross
section, as well as for the particular beam charge dis-
tributions — double-Gaussian and uniform rectangular
distribution.

While we have not discussed this subject in the present
paper, the calculated corrections to beam ﬁelds can be
directly applied in calculating beam coupling impedances
produced by small discontinuities of the vacuum chamber
using the methods of Refs. [7,8].

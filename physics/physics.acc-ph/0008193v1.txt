Abstract

The performance of various systems of the Next Linear
Collider (NLC) have been studied in terms of ground mo-
tion using recently developed models. In particular, the per-
formance of the beam delivery system is discussed. Plans
to evaluate the operation of the main linac beam-based
alignment and feedback systems are also outlined.

INTRODUCTION

Ground motion is a limiting factor in the performance of fu-
ture linear colliders because it continuously misaligns the
focusing and accelerating elements. An adequate mathe-
matical model of ground motion would allow prediction
and optimization of the performance of various subsystems
of the linear collider.

The ground motion model presented in [9] is based on
measurements performed at the SLAC site and incorpo-
rates fast wave-like motion, and diffusive and systematic
slow motion. The studies presented in this paper include,
in addition, several representative conditions with different
cultural noise contributions. These models were then used
in simulations of the NLC ﬁnal focus and the main linac.

2 GROUND MOTION MODELS

The ground motion model for the SLAC site [9] is based
on measurements of fast motion taken at night in one of the
quietest locations in the SLAC, sector 10 of the linac [5].

To evaluate different levels of cultural noise, we augment
this model to represent two other cases with signiﬁcantly
higher and lower contributions of cultural noise. The cor-
responding measured spectra and the approximations used
in the models are shown in Fig.1.

The “HERA model” is based on measurements in DESY
[3] and corresponds to a very noisy shallow tunnel located
in a highly populated area where no precautions were made
to reduce the contribution of various noise sources in the
lab and in the tunnel. The “LEP model” corresponds to a
deep tunnel where the noise level is very close to the natural
seismic level, without additional cultural sources outside or
inside of the tunnel. The “SLAC model” represents a shal-
low tunnel located in a moderately populated area with a
dead zone around the tunnel to allow damping of cultural
noise and with some effort towards proper engineering of
the in-tunnel equipment. (Note: the names of these models
were used for convenience, and not to indicate the accept-
ability of each particular location.)

ferent conditions [1, 3, 5, 2] and the approximation curves.

The correlation properties of the “LEP model” corre-
spond to a phase velosity v = 3000 m/s [1]. Both
the “SLAC model” and the “HERA model” use a phase
velosity corresponding to v(f ) = 450 + 1900 exp(−f /2)
(with v in m/s, f in Hz) which was determined approxi-
mately in the SLAC correlation measurements [5]. This
approximation was found to be suitable for representing
the DESY correlation measurements [3], at least for fre-
quencies greater than a few Hz, which contain most of the
effects of the cultural noise.

3 APPLICATIONS TO FFS

The ground motion models developed were applied to two
versions of the NLC Final Focus, to the one described in
Ref. [5] as well as the current FFS described in Ref. [10].
The FF performance is usually evaluated using the 2-D
spectrum P (ω, k) given by the ground motion model plus
spectral response functions which show the contribution to
the beam distortion at the IP of different spatial harmonics
of misalignment.

We summarize below the basics of the approach de-
veloped in [2, 4] and [5]. Considering a beamline with
misaligned elements, as in Fig.2, the beam offset at the
exit of the beamline and the dispersion (for example) can
be evaluated using

N

ci xi(t) − xﬁn and η(t) =

di xi(t)

Xi=1

x∗(t) =

Xi=1

where ci = dx∗/dxi and di = dη/dxi are the coef-
ﬁcients found using the parameters of the focusing ele-
ments and the optical properties of the channel. In a thin
lens approximation to linear order, ci = −Ki ri
12 and
126). Here Ki is r21 of the quad ma-
di = Ki (ri
trix, and ri
126 are the matrix elements from the i-th
quadrupole to the exit. Fig.3 shows the ci coefﬁcients cal-
culated for the new NLC Final Focus [10].

It is straightforward then to combine these coefﬁcients
into the spectral response functions which show the
contribution of misalignment spatial harmonics to the
relative beam offset or to the beam distortion at the IP. For
example, for the dispersion:

Gη(k) =  N
Xi=1

di(cos(ksi) − 1)!

The spectral functions for the relative beam offset, longitu-
dinal beam waist shift or coupling can be found in a similar
manner and examples of the spectral functions for the new
NLC FF are shown in Fig.4.

The time evolution of the beam dispersion, without the

effect of feedbacks, can then be evaluated using

hη2(t)i =Z ∞

where P (t, k) represents a (t, k) incarnation of the ground
motion spectrum P (ω, k):

P (t, k) =Z ∞

−∞

P (ω, k) 2 [1 − cos(ωt)]

dω

In the case where a feedback with a gain of F (ω) is
applied, the equilibrium beam offset can be evaluated as

though more realistic simulations would be necessary to
produce a reliable result.
In the examples given below,
we used an idealized approximation of the feedback gain
function F (ω) = min((f /f0)2, 1) with f0 = 6 Hz; this
is a good representation of the SLC feedback algorithm for
120 Hz operation.

Such analytical evaluation of ground motion, using the
P (ω, k) spectrum and the spectral response functions for

the transport lines is included in the PWK module of the
ﬁnal focus design and analysis code FFADA [6].

Evaluation of the traditional and new Final Focus in
terms of the rms beam offset for the “SLAC model” is
shown in Fig.5. One can see that in terms of generalized
tolerances these two systems are very similar. However, in
the new system which has longer L∗, more rigid support
can be used for the ﬁnal doublet which makes the perfor-
mance closer to the ideal. One can also see that if one could
eliminate the contribution from the ﬁnal doublet by active
stabilization, it would remove about 80% of the effect.

The free IP beam distortion evolution for the traditional
and new NLC FF is shown in Fig.6 for the “SLAC model”.
Note that an orbit correction which could keep the orbit sta-
ble through the sextupoles would drastically decrease this
beam distortion. The picture presented is therefore useful
only for comparison of the performance of the two FF sys-
tems. One can see, that the new FF, having longer L∗ and
correspondingly higher chromaticity, has somewhat tighter
tolerances. The orbit feedback, however, may be much
simpler since there are fewer sensitive elements in the new
system.

The analytical results presented in Fig.6 are in good
agreement with the tracking. One should note here that

the “SLAC model” would certainly be suitable, while the
“LEP model” would be suitable even for much more ambi-
tious beam parameters. These results should not be consid-
ered as an attempt to evaluate any particular site, or even the
models, because for a fully consistent assessment, various
in-tunnel noise sources as well as vibration compensation
methods must be considered together.

4 APPLICATIONS TO LINAC

The models now developed, which more adequately de-
scribe the various components of ground motion, can
also be applied to simulations of the beam based align-
ment procedures and cascaded feedback in the main linac.
Such simulations require direct modeling of misalignments
which is done by summing harmonics whose amplitudes
are given by the 2-D spectrum of the corresponding ground
motion model. In this case, since a large range of T and L
must be covered in a single simulation run, the harmonics
are distributed over the relevant (ω, k) range equidistantly
in a logarithmic sense [8]. Such a method of ground motion
modeling is now included in the linear accelerator research
code LIAR [7] in addition to the previously implemented
ATL model. An example of the misalignments generated
by LIAR is shown in Fig.8.

5 CONCLUSION

New ground motion models now incorporate various
sources of ground motion such as wave-like motion, diffu-
sive and systematic motion. These models are being used to
evaluate and optimize performance of various subsystems
of the NLC.

computed using the FFADA program [6].

the tracking was done with an energy spread which is 3
times smaller than nominal (see [10] for these beam param-
eters) because otherwise the second order tracking routine
of the MONCHOU program used for misalignment simu-
lation did not produce reliable results when compared with
other programs.

Comparison of the performance of the new FF in terms
of different ground motion models is shown in Fig.7. One
can see that a site located in a highly populated area without
proper vibration sensitive engineering would present sig-
niﬁcant difﬁculties for a linear collider with the parameters
considered. Stabilization of only the ﬁnal doublet would
not be sufﬁcient in this case. A site with noise similar to

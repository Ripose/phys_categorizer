Abstract

A hydrodynamical description of coherent instabilities that take place in the longitudinal dy-

namics of a charged-particle coasting beam in a high-energy accelerating machine is presented.

This is done in the framework of the Madelung ﬂuid picture provided by the Thermal Wave

Model. The well known coherent instability charts in the complex plane of the longitudinal cou-

pling impedance for monochromatic beams are recovered. The results are also interpreted in terms

of the deterministic approach to modulational instability analysis usually given for monochromatic

large amplitude wave train propagation governed by the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation. The in-

stability analysis is then extended to a non-monochromatic coasting beam with a given thermal

equilibrium distribution, thought as a statistical ensemble of monochromatic incoherent coasting

beams (”white” beam). In this hydrodynamical framework, the phenomenon of Landau damping

is predicted without using any kinetic equation governing the phase space evolution of the system.

INTRODUCTION TO THE MADELUNG FLUID PICTURE

A very valuable seminal contribution to quantum mechanics was given by de Broglie

around 1926 with the concept of ”quantum potential”, just after proposing his theory of

pilot waves [1]. However, an organic presentation of this idea came only several years later

[2]. At the beginning of Fifties, Bohm also have considered the concept of quantum potential

[3]. Actually, the concept was already naturally appearing in a hydrodynamical description

proposed in 1926 by Madelung [4] (ﬁrst proposal of a hydrodynamical model of quantum

mechanics), followed by the proposal of Korn in 1927 [5]. The Madelung ﬂuid description

of quantum mechanics revealed to be very fruitful in a number of applications:

from the

pilot waves theory to the hidden variables theory, from stochastic mechanics to quantum

cosmology (for a historical review, see Ref. [6]).

In the recently-past years, it has been also applied to disciplines where the quantum

formalism is a useful tool for describing the evolution of classical systems (quantum-like

systems) or to solve classical nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations [7].

In the Madelung ﬂuid description, the wave function, say Ψ, being a complex quantity, is

represented in terms of modulus and phase which, substituted in the Schr¨odinger equation,
allow to obtain a pair of nonlinear ﬂuid equations for the ”density” ρ = |Ψ|2 and the ”current

velocity” V = ∇Arg(Ψ): one is the continuity equation (taking into account the probability

conservation) and the other one is a Navier-Stokes-like motion equation, which contains a
force term proportional to the gradient of the quantum potential, i.e., ∝ (∇2|Ψ|)/|Ψ| =
(∇2ρ1/2)/ρ1/2. The nonlinear character of these system of ﬂuid equations naturally allows

to extend the Madelung description to systems whose dynamics is governed by one ore more

NLSEs. Remarkably, during the last four decades, this quantum methodology was imported

practically into all the nonlinear sciences, especially in nonlinear optics [8]– [10] and plasma

physics [11], [12] and it revealed to be very powerful in solving a number of problems. Let

us consider, the following (1+1)D nonlinear Schr¨odinger-like equation (NLSE):

where U [|Ψ|2] is, in general, a functional of |Ψ|2, the constant α accounts for the dispersive

eﬀects, and s and x are the timelike and the conﬁgurational coordinates, respectively. Let

In order to give the Madelung ﬂuid description of a charged-particle beam, in the next

section, we present the NLSE describing the longitudinal dynamics of a coasting beam in the

presence of nonlinear collective and nonlocal eﬀects in high-energy accelerating machines in

the framework of the Thermal Wave Model (TWM).

II. THE NLSE IN THE FRAMEWORK OF TWM.

Within the TWM framework, the longitudinal dynamics of particle bunches is described

in terms of a complex wave function Ψ(x, s), where s is the distance of propagation and x is

the longitudinal extension of the particle beam, measured in the moving frame of reference.
The particle density, λ(x, s), is related to the wave function according to λ(x, s) = |Ψ(x, s)|2,

[13]. The collective longitudinal evolution of the beam in a circular high-energy accelerating

machine is governed by the Schr¨odinger-like equation

where ǫ is the longitudinal beam emittance and η is the slip factor, [14], deﬁned as η = γ
T −
γ−2 (γT being the transition energy, deﬁned as the inverse of the momentum compaction,

[14], and γ being the relativistic factor); U(x, s) is the eﬀective dimensionless (with respect to
the nominal particle energy, E0 = mγc2) potential energy given by the interaction between

the bunch and the surroundings. Note that η can be positive (above transition energy) or

3

negative (below transition energy). Above the transition energy, in analogy with quantum

mechanics, 1/η plays the role of an eﬀective mass associated with the beam as a whole.

Below transition energy, 1/η plays the role of a “negative mass”.

Equation (6) has to be coupled with an equation for U. If no external sources of electro-

magnetic ﬁelds are present and the eﬀects of charged-particle radiation damping is negligible,

the self-interaction between the beam and the surroundings, due to the image charges and

the image currents originated on the walls of the vacuum chamber, makes U a functional

of the beam density. It can proven that, in a torus-shaped accelerating machine, character-

ized by a toroidal radius R0 and a poloidal radius a, for a coasting beam of radius b << a

travelling at velocity βc (β ≤ 1 and c being the speed of light), the self-interaction potential

energy is given by [15] (a more general expression is given in Ref. [16]):

where λ1(x, s) is an (arbitrarily large) line beam density perturbation, q is the charge of
the particles, ǫ0 is the vacuum dielectric constant, Z ′

I are the resistive and the total
reactive parts, respectively, of the longitudinal coupling impedance per unit length of the

as the diﬀerence between the total space charge capacitive reactance, g0Z0/(2βγ2), and the

total inductive reactance, ω0L. Consequently, in the limit of negligible resistance, Eq. (7)

By deﬁnition, an unperturbed coasting beam has the particles uniformly distributed along

the longitudinal coordinate x. Denoting by ρ(x, s) the line density and by ρ(x, 0) the un-

perturbed one, in the TWM framework we have the following identiﬁcations: ρ(x, s) =
|Ψ(x, s)|2, ρ0 = |Ψ(x, 0)|2 ≡ |Ψ0|2, where Ψ0 is a complex function and, consequently,
λ1(x, s) = |Ψ(x, s)|2 − |Ψ0|2. Thus, the combination of Eq. (6) and Eq. (7) gives the follow-

recently described with this equation. Note that Eq. (10) can be cast in the form of Eq. (1),

III. COHERENT INSTABILITY ANALYSIS AND ITS IDENTIFICATION WITH

THE MODULATIONAL INSTABILITY

A. Deterministic approach to MI (monochromatic coasting beam)

Under the conditions assumed above, let us consider a monochromatic coasting beam

travelling in a circular high-energy machine with the unperturbed velocity V0 and the un-
perturbed density ρ0 = |Ψ0|2 (equilibrium state). In these conditions, all the particles of

the beam have the same velocity and their collective interaction with the surroundings is

absent. In the Madelung ﬂuid representation, the beam can be thought as a ﬂuid with both

current velocity and density (i.e., ρ0) uniform and constant. In this state, the Madelung

ﬂuid equations (3) and (4) vanish identically. Let us now introduce small perturbations in

V (x, s) and ρ(x, s), i.e.,

V = V0 + V1 ,

|V1| << |V0| ,

ρ = ρ0 + ρ1 ,

|ρ1| << ρ0 .

By introducing (15) and (16) in the pair of equations (3) and (4), after linearizing, we get

the following system of equations:

In order to ﬁnd the linear dispersion relation, we take the Fourier transform of the system

of equations (17) and (18), i.e. we express the quantities ρ1(x, s) and V1(x, s) in terms of
their Fourier transforms ˜ρ1(k, ω) and ˜V1(k, ω), respectively,

ρ1(x, s) =

dk dω ˜ρ1(k, ω)eikx−iωs ,

V1(x, s) =

dk dω ˜V1(k, ω)eikx−iωs ,

and, after substituting in (17) and (18), we get the following system of algebraic equations:

− ρ0k ˜V1 = (kV0 − ω) ˜ρ1 ,

where we have introduced the complex quantity Z = R + ikX ≡ ZR + iZI, proportional to

the longitudinal coupling impedance per unity length of the beam. In general, in Eq. (23),

ω is a complex quantity, i.e., ω ≡ ωR + iωI. If ωI 6= 0, the modulational instability takes

place in the system. Thus, by substituting the complex form of ω in Eq. (23), separating

the real from the imaginary parts and using (11), we ﬁnally get:

This equation ﬁxes, for any values of the wavenumber k and any values of the growth rate ωI

a relationship between real and imaginary parts of the longitudinal coupling impedance. For

each ωI 6= 0, running the values of the slip factor η, it describes two families of parabolas

in the complex plane (ZR − ZI). Each pair (ZR, ZI) in this plane represents a working

point of the accelerating machine. Consequently, each parabola is the locus of the working

points associated with a ﬁxed growth rate of the MI. According to Figure 1, below the

The bold face vertical straight lines represent the stability region (ωI = 0).

transition energy (γ < γT ), η is positive and therefore the instability parabolas have a

negative concavity, whilst above the transition energy (γ > γT ), since η is negative the

instability parabolas have a positive concavity (negative mass instability). It is clear from

Eq.

(24) that, approaching ωI = 0 from positive (negative) values, the two families of

parabolas reduce asymptotically to a straight line upper (lower) unlimited located on the

imaginary axis. The straight line represent the only possible region below (above) the

transition) energy where the system is modulationally stable against small perturbations

in both density and velocity of the beam, with respect to their unperturbed values ρ0 and

V0, respectively (note that density and velocity are directly connected with amplitude and

phase, respectively, of the wave function Ψ). Any other point of the complex plane belongs

to a instability parabola (ωI 6= 0).

In the limit of small dispersion, i.e., ǫk << 1, the second term of the right hand side of

Eq. (23) can be neglected and Eq. (24) reduces to

Furthermore, for purely reactive impedances (ZR ≡ 0), Eq. (10) reduces to the cubic NLSE

and the corresponding dispersion relation gives (note that in this case ωR = V0k)

transition energy and for capacitive (inductive) impedances and stable in the other diﬀerent

B. MI analysis of a white coasting beam

coasting beam Y ≡ 1/Z:

(29)

Let us now consider a non-monochromatic coasting beam. Such a system may be thought

as an ensemble of incoherent coasting beams with diﬀerent unperturbed velocities (white

beam). Let us call f0(V ) the distribution function of the velocity at the equilibrium. The

subsystem corresponding to a coasting beam collecting the particles having velocities be-

tween V and V + dV has an elementary admittance dY. Provided, in Eq. (29), to replace

ρ0 with f0(V )dV , the expression for the elementary admittance is easily given:

kdY =

iα f0(V ) dV
2
(V − ω/k)

− α2k2/4

.

All the elementary coasting beams in which we have divided the system suﬀer the same

electric voltage per unity length along the longitudinal direction. This means that the total

admittance of the system is the sum of the all elementary admittances, as it happens for a

system of electric wires connected all in parallel. Therefore,

Of course, this dispersion relation can be cast also in the following way:

An interesting equivalent form of Eq. (32) can be obtained. To this end, we ﬁrst observe

(34)

(35)

We soon observe that, assuming that f0(V ) is proportional to δ(V − V0), from Eq. (35) we

easily recover the dispersion relation for the case of a monochromatic coasting beam (see Eq.

(23) ). In general, Eq. (35) takes into account the equilibrium velocity (or energy) spread of

the beam particles, but it has not obtained with a kinetic treatment. We have only assumed

the existence of an equilibrium state associated with an equilibrium velocity distribution,

without taking into account any phase-space evolution in terms of a kinetic distribution

function. Our result has been basically obtained within the framework of Madelung ﬂuid

description, extending the standard MI analysis for monochromatic wave trains to non-

monochromatic wave packets (statistical ensemble of monochromatic coasting beams).

Nevertheless, Eq. (35) can be also obtained within the kinetic description provided by

the Moyal-Ville-Wigner description [31] - [33], as it has been done for the ﬁrst time in the

context of the TWM [21] soon extended to nonlinear optics [22]-[25], plasma physics [26],

[27], surface gravity waves [28], in lattice vibrations physics (molecular crystals) [29], [30].

From the above investigations, and according to the former quantum kinetic approaches

to nonlinear systems [34], [35], we can summarize the following general conclusions.

• There are two distinct ways to describe MI. The ﬁrst, and the most used one, is a

”deterministic” approach, whilst the second one is a ”statistical approach”.

• In the statistical approach, the basic idea is to transit from the conﬁguration space

description, where the NLSE governs the particular wave-envelope propagation, to the

phase space, where an appropriate kinetic equation is able to show a random version

of the MI. This has been accomplished by using the mathematical tool provided by

the ”quasidistribution” (Fourier transform of the density matrix) that is widely used

for quantum systems. In fact, for any nonlinear system, whose dynamics is governed

by the NLSE, one can introduce a two-points correlation function which plays the

role similar to the one played by the density matrix of a quantum system [36]-[38].

Consequently, the governing kinetic equation is nothing but a sort of nonlinear von

Neumann-Weyl equation.

In the statistical approach to modulational instability, a

linear stability analysis of the von Neumann-Weyl equation leads to a phenomenon

fully similar to the well known Landau damping, predicted by L.D. Landau in 1946

for plasma waves [39]

• The deterministic MI can be recovered for the case of a monochromatic wavetrain;

10

in particular, it coincides with coherent instability of a coasting beam in the limit of

weak dispersion.

• A Landau–type damping for a non-monochromatic wavepacket is predicted and the

weak Landau damping is recovered for weak dispersion, in particular for plasma waves

and particle beams in the usual kinetic Vlasov-Maxwell framework.

• The interplay between Landau damping and MI characterizes the statistical behavior

of the nonlinear collective wave packet propagation governed by the NLSE.

All the above conclusions have been obtained within the kinetic description from a dis-

persion relation fully similar to Eq. (35). Consequently, it is absolutely evident that all

the above conclusions can be obtained within the framework of the Madelung description

of a white intense charged-particle coasting beam. This proves that the Madelung ﬂuid

description of the MI of an ensemble of incoherent beams (white beam) is equivalent to the

one provided by the Moyal-Ville-Wigner kinetic theory.

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND REMARKS

In this paper, we have developed a hydrodynamical description of coherent instability of

an intense white coasting charged-particle beam in high-energy accelerator in the presence

of nonlinear collective and nonlocal eﬀects. The analysis has been based on the Madelung

ﬂuid model within the framework of the TWM. It has been shown that this quantum hy-

drodynamical description of MI, with both deterministic or statistical character, is fully

equivalent to the one provided by the quantum kinetic theory. Remarkably, the proposed

hydrodynamical description is certainly very convenient in particle accelerators because it

is very close to the standard classical picture of particle beams (in particular white beams)

in particle accelerators.

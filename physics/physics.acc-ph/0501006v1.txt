Abstract

Channeling of high-energy particles in straight and bent multi-wall nan-
otubes (MWNT) has been studied in computer simulations and compared to
the channeling properties of single-wall nanotubes (SWNT) and bent crystal
lattices.
It is demonstrated that MWNT can eﬃciently channel positively-
charged high-energy particles trapped between the walls of MWNT. Bending
dechanneling in MWNT has been computed as a function of the particle mo-
mentum to nanotube curvature radius ratio, pv/R. It is found that a bent
MWNT can steer a particle beam with bending capabilities similar to those
of bent silicon crystal lattice and to those of best (i.e. the narrowest) SWNT.
In view of channeling applications at particle accelerators, MWNT appear fa-
vored as compared to SWNT, because MWNT can be produced quite straight
(and in aligned array), while SWNT is typically very curved, thus posing a se-
vere problem for channeling applications. Therefore, we suggest that MWNT
provide a better candidate for channeling than SWNT.

Introduction

Bent channeling crystals are well established as a technical tool for steering of par-
ticle beams at accelerators [1]. The related physics has been experimentally tested
in the energy range spanning over six decades, from 3 MeV [2] to 900 GeV [3, 4].
Today, bent crystals are broadly used for extraction of 70-GeV protons at IHEP
(Protvino) with eﬃciency of 85% routinely obtained at intensity well over 1012 par-
ticle per second [5]. Channeling technique is used at IHEP for beam delivery since
1987 on everyday basis [6, 7]. About ten channeling crystals are installed on six
locations in the main ring of the 70 GeV proton accelerator of IHEP. A bent crystal
(5 mm Si) was installed into the Yellow ring of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Col-
lider where it channeled Au ions and polarised protons of 100-250 GeV/u, within
the framework of the collimation experiment [8]. There has been interest to apply
channeling technique at accelerators from TeV colliders for collimation and extrac-
tion [9, 10, 11, 12] down to sub-GeV microbeam facilities [13], or for instance to use
it for a channeling undulator [14, 15, 16].

Nanostructured material oﬀers an interesting alternative to crystal lattices as
a guide for channeled particles [17, 18]. First, it is a material with very unusual
properties [19]. The channels in the nano-ordered material can be much wider than
those in crystals, and the channeled particles are trapped in two dimensions (in a
nanotube) rather than in one dimension like with crystal planar channels. Second,
the nano-material can be designed to ﬁt applications the best, in principle, with a
wide choice of geometrical characteristics and atomic content [19, 20].

Single-wall nanotube (SWNT) channeling has been studied in computer simu-
lations by several authors [17, 22, 22, 23]. In our previous simulation study [24] of
channeling in straight and bent SWNT we answered the question of what kind of
nanotube geometry (diameter) would ﬁt best the application of SWNT for particle
beam steering at accelerators. Another essential question answered [24] was: how
SWNT compares to bent crystal lattice in particle channeling. Narrow (order of 1
nm in diameter or less) nanotubes were found to have an eﬃciency of beam bending
similar to that of silicon crystal lattice, while wider nanotubes appear useless for
particle steering because of poor eﬃciency [24].

Multi-wall nanotubes (MWNT) have not been a subject of channeling research so
far. While SWNT with its wide channel looks at ﬁrst glance a naturally attractive
object for channeling research, MWNT is a rather dense pack of walls with the
spacing of about 0.34 nm (in the case of carbon) which is much narrower than the
width of SWNT. However, it is still about two times larger than the spacing in the
crystal lattice channels. MWNT are a very common nanostructure and actually
were discovered ﬁrst, ahead of SWNT.

2

An essential feature of MWNT is that it is very straight on production, unlike
SWNT which is very curved. Also, MWNT are much more easily produced as an
aligned array of straight parallel tubes than SWNT. From the practical viewpoint
of channeling applications all this is of paramount importance. However, the chan-
neling properties of MWNT have to be demonstrated ﬁrst and clariﬁed. Further
on, the fact found in the study [24] that the spacing in the channel should not be
too large, in order to make it eﬃcient has also stimulated us to try MWNT for
channeling. Finally, without Monte Carlo simulation of a particle beam interaction
with a nanostructure, it is very diﬃcult to decide what kind of nanostructure would
be best suited for channeling.

2 Channeling in MWNT

For Monte Carlo simulations of particle interaction with a MWNT we applied the
same model as in our previous work [24] on SWNT channeling. The model was
upgraded to take into account multiple walls. A MWNT has an internal diameter
(the one of the narrowest tube in the pack) and an external diameter. Their typical
values are a few nanometers and a few tens of nanometer respectively, for carbon
nanotubes [19, 20].

Channeling inside the internal diameter of MWNT is not of interest, because of
poor eﬃciency shown due to a large width of this channel [24] and because of its
small cross-section with respect to the total cross-section of the MWNT. Therefore,
we were interested in channeling between the walls in the bulk of MWNT. Our
simulations were done for carbon MWNT.

As previously, we average the potential U (ρ, φ, z) of a straight nanotube over
the longitudinal coordinate z and azimuth angle φ to obtain a potential U (ρ) with
cylinder symmetry. As in crystal channeling, the averaging over z is well justiﬁed
as a collision of a particle with a nanotube wall under a glancing angle does involve
many thousand atoms along the particle trajectory. For the same reason, the av-
eraging over φ is equally justiﬁed if the nanotube has an arbitrary helicity [22] as
deﬁned by nanotube indices (m, n). In the special cases of zigzag (m = 0) or arm-
chair (m = n) nanotubes, the wall consists of atomic rows parallel to the nanotube
axis; the nanotube potential is then deﬁned by the sum of potentials of the rows,
and this case deserves a separate consideration. Further on in the Letter we apply
only the averaged potential U (ρ) for a straight nanotube. This approach reveals the
general features of nanotube channeling.

In a carbon SWNT, the channeled particles are conﬁned in a potential well U (ρ)
with the depth U0 of about 60 eV. The ﬁeld experienced by a high-energy particle

3

moving in an aligned MWNT is the sum of the ﬁelds of single walls of diﬀerent
diameter with the same axis. In addition to atomic potentials, in a nanotube bent
with radius R, an eﬀective potential taking into account a centrifugal term pvx/R is
introduced similarly to bent crystals [1]: Uef f (ρ, φ) = U (ρ, φ) + pvx/R, where x =
r cos(φ) is the coordinate in the direction of bending, pv is the particle momentum
times velocity.

We use so-called standard potential introduced by Lindhard [25]. When averaged

over (φ, z), the potential of SWNT is described by [17]:

(where density of the nuclei is signiﬁcant) is also strongly aﬀected by the nuclear
scattering.

Two mechanisms of particle transfer from channeled to random states are well
known for crystals: scattering on electrons and nuclei and curvature of the channel
[1]. A typical nanotube is less than 0.1 mm in length at present. For such a short
channel, the scattering on electrons within the bulk of the tube is insigniﬁcant for
high-energy particles. However, a curvature of the tube could quickly (in less than
one oscillation) bring much of the channeled particles out of the potential well or
into close collisions with the nuclei of the nanotube walls.

Figure 1 shows (a) an example of the trajectory of a particle channeled in a
straight MWNT, trapped between the pair of adjacent walls. The radial motion
of the channeled particle is ﬁnite while in azimuthal direction it is free. Figure 1
(b) shows an example of the trajectory when MWNT is weakly bent; obviously, the
particle is localised in some range of φ to conform to a centrifugal force when moving
along a bent nanostructure. An example of the stronger bending is illustrated by
Figure 1 (c).

As a result of bending, the MWNT phase-space of transverse coordinates and
transverse angles available for channeled particles is reduced. The particles chan-
neled through a bent MWNT are deﬂected at the angle of MWNT bending. Figure
2 shows an example of the angular distribution of particles downstream of the 50-
µm long MWNT bent 5 mrad, shown in the direction of bending. Similarly to the
pictures of bent crystal channeling, there is clear separation of channeled and non-
channeled peaks, with some particles lost (dechanneled along the tube) between the
peaks.

This example shows that channeled particles can survive in a bent MWNT, so
the eﬀect could be used for steering of high-energy particles provided its eﬃciency
in MWNT is good enough compared to SWNT and crystal lattices.

3 Comparison of MWNT to SWNT and to
crystal lattice

While the capability of MWNT to channel particles could be hoped for from the
standpoint of channeling theory, just from the existence of channels, the channeling
eﬃciency of MWNT relative to other channeling structures such as SWNT and
crystal lattices is not obvious at all, unless this issue is studied in Monte Carlo
simulations.

We looked in simulations how channeled particles survive in multi-wall nanotubes
of diﬀerent curvatures. The Monte Carlo studies of nanotube channeling eﬃciency

5

were done over a broad range of bendings for the nanotube, and with a range of
MWNT size (inner and outer diameters) about its typical value in a synthesized
MWNT. A parallel beam of 1 GeV protons was entering a carbon nanotube, where
protons were tracked over 50µm. Multiple scattering was not included, so we did
evaluate only the eﬀects of bending dechanneling. Figure 3 shows the number of
protons channeled through 50µm of MWNT as a function of the centrifugal force
pv/R; for comparison, we also show the same function for SWNT and Si (110)
crystal lattice.

Figure 3 shows similar slopes of the curves for MWNT, SWNT and Si(110),
this means that the number of channeled particles in a MWNT declines at a rate
similar to that in the other eﬃcient channeling structures. This holds true both
for the moderate bendings 0.1 to 1 GeV/cm (equivalent to 30-300 T magnetic ﬁeld,
Figure 3 (a)) where silicon channeling crystals are used for beam steering at the
high-energy accelerators nowadays, and for the strong bendings of 1 to 4 GeV/cm
(equivalent to 300-1200 T, Figure 4 (b)). Such a study was done for MWNT of
diﬀerent external and internal diameter, and the same results were obtained; the
parameter that matters was the interwall spacing ﬁxed at 0.34 nm. Notice that
1 nm diameter) while wider SWNT
MWNT competes with the best of SWNT (
(
≥

1 nm) are less eﬃcient in steering (bending) of the channeled particles.

Further research and potential applications

The feasibility of experiments to test channeling and coherent scattering with the
existing samples of very short (tens of micron) nanotubes at high energy accelerators
has been demonstrated in Monte Carlo simulations [27, 28]. These studies could be
extended also to the comparison of MWNT versus SWNT. Such experiments are
in preparation at IHEP and LNF. Practical considerations, such as the demand for
a good alignment within the array of nanotubes, could play a leading role in the
choice of nanostructured material for channeling studies. Since we have shown that
MWNT are at least as good channeling structures as SWNT, further considerations
driven by technology may well switch the general interest from SWNT to MWNT
as channeling candidates. While SWNT are very curly on production in general,
MWNT are quite straight and come in aligned arrays, which is a great technological
advantage in view of channeling application.

With high energy beams and typically short nanotubes available, the issue of
dechanneling length due to scattering on electrons within the bulk of the tube is less
important at the time. However, this issue is physically very interesting because
of low electronic density (and hence low electronic scattering) in the bulk of the

6

nanotube, and it deserves a special study.

Whereas the interest to nanotube channeling at this early stage is more academic,
some application can be quoted in relation with unique capabilities of nanotube
channeling. There is a need in beams of very small emittance, ”microbeams” or even
”nanobeams”, and channeling technique can be a help here [13]. The capability to
produce beams with very small cross-section, i.e. ”nano-beams”, will be helpful in
medical, biological, and technological applications. We refer to [13, 29] for discussion
of it.

5 Summary

Channeling and centrifugal dechanneling phenomena have been demonstrated and
studied for positively charged particles in MWNT. As shown in computer simula-
tions, MWNT can channel particle beams with eﬃciency similar to that of crystal
channeling, and to that of SWNT, despite the fact that the geometry of MWNT,
and respectively the potential wells where channeled particles can be trapped, are
very diﬀerent from the case of SWNT.

Together with the advantage of MWNT produced typically quite straight (unlike
SWNT with strong parasitic curvature) and in aligned arrays, this ﬁnding suggests
that a MWNT is a better candidate for channeling than a SWNT. Multi-wall nan-
otubes could make a basis for an eﬃcient technique of beam steering at particle
accelerators.

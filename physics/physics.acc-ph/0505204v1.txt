(Dated: July 26, 2013)

The longitudinal dynamics of electron bunches with a large energy spread circulating in the storage
rings with a small momentum compaction factor is considered. Also the structure of the longitudinal
phase space is considered as well as its modiﬁcation due to changes in the ring parameters. The
response of an equilibrium area upon changes of the nonlinear momentum compaction factor is
presented.

INTRODUCTION

II. FINITE-DIFFERENCE MODEL OF
LONGITUDINAL MOTION

Engagement of electron storage rings for production
of x rays through Compton scattering of laser photons
against ultrarelativistic electrons was proposed in 1998
[1]. Two basic schemes exist so far. One of them supposes
use of electron beams with unsteady parameters [2] and
applies the continual injection (and ejection of circulating
bunches by the next injecting pulse) of dense intensive
bunches. The second scheme is based on the continuous
circulation of bunches. To make the bunches acquired a
suﬃciently large energy spread conﬁned (see [3]), a lattice
with a small controllable momentum compaction factor
is proposed to employ [4]. The longitudinal dynamics
in the small compaction lattice is governed not only by
the linear eﬀects of the momentum deviation but by the
nonlinear ones as well.

In Compton sources storing the bunches with the large
energy spread which can be as high as a few percents,
ring’s energy acceptance becomes compared to the en-
ergy spread. To get proper life time of the circulating
electrons, the energy acceptance σ ≡ max(E − Es)/Es
(Es is the energy of synchronous particle) should be high
enough.

Within a linear approximation according to the en-
ergy deviation, the acceptance can be increased either
by enhancement of the RF voltage, Vrf , or by decreas-
ing of the linear momentum compaction factor α0 since
σ ∝

Vrf /α0.

The paper presents results of study on the longitudi-
nal dynamics of electron bunches circulating in storage
rings with a small linear momentum compaction factor
α0. Structure of the phase space are considered and its
deformation with changes in the ring lattice parameters.
In particular, the size of stable area as a function of the
RF voltage and momentum compaction is evaluated.

Let us consider a model of the ring comprised only two
components: drift and radio frequency (rf) cavity. For
the sake of simplicity we will suggest the cavity inﬁnitely
short, in which the particle momentum (energy) suﬀer
an abrupt change while the phase of a particle remains
unchanged. On the contrary, the phase of a particle trav-
eling along the drift changes while the energy remains
invariable. The longitudinal motion in a such idealized
ring will be described in canonically conjugated variables
φ (the phase about zero voltage in the cavity) and the
momentum p ≡ (γ − γs)/γs equal to the relative devia-
tion of the particle energy from the synchronous one (γs
is the Lorentz factor of the synchronous particle).

To study systems able to conﬁne the beams with large
energy spread, one needs to account not only the linear
part of the orbit deviation from the synchronous one, but
nonlinear terms as well:

∆x ≈ D1p + D2p2 + . . . ,

where D1 and D2 are the dispersion functions of the ﬁrst
and second orders, respectively.

Noting of formal similarity of Eqs. (8) to canonical
Hamilton equations describing a mathematical pendu-
lum, we can use a smoothed analog to these equations

∆τ → 0) to facilitate analysis of the motion

To analyze a phase portrait of the system, it is expe-
dient to present Hamilton function of the longitudinal
motion in the reduced form:

∆τ = τf − τi =

(tf − ti) ,

βc
L

the subscripts i and f correspond to the initial and
ﬁnal values, respectively. The dimensionless variable
τ = tβc/L represents time expressed in number of rota-
tions (t is time, βc the velocity of a particle). The factors
κ0 and κ1 at a large γs are determined by the expressions
κ0 = 2πhη0 ≈ 2πhα0, κ1 = 2πhη1 ≈ 2πh(α0 + α1) ( h
the harmonic number).

From Eqs. (7), diﬀerential (smoothed) equations can
be deduced. As it seen, the RHS of (7b) contains the
ﬁnal value of the phase φf expressed via the initial value
φi and momentum pi by the equation (7a).

Let us expand sin φf into series of powers of ∆τ :

sin φf = sin

φi + (κ0pi + κ1p2
i )∆τ
≈ sin φi + cos φi(κ0pi + κ1p2
i )∆τ .

Since ∆τ can not be regarded as inﬁnitesimal (formally
Eqs. (7) present a complete turn, ∆τ = 1), then the
linear term can be neglected if κ0pi + κ1p2
i ≪ 1. In the
considered case it can be done since maximum of the
energy spread does not exceed a few percents, and the
momentum compaction factor α0 supposed small. From
these assumptions, ﬁnite diﬀerence equations reduce to

Phase portraits of motion with the Hamiltonian (12)
represented in Fig. 1. Topology of the phase plane is
governed by the magnitude and sign of the parameter
µ. At zero value, µ = 0, the Hamiltonian (11) or (12)
has a form of mathematical pendulum; its phase plane is
presented in Fig. 1(a).

Within the interval 0 ≤ µ2 < 1/12, there an additional
area of ﬁnite motion appears; this area is separated from
the main area with the band of inﬁnite motion as depicted
in Fig. 1(b). When the parameter µ exceeds the critical
value µ2
c = 1/12 [see Fig. 1(c)], e.g. 1/12 ≤ µ2 < ∞,
the structure of the phase plane will have changed as is
represented in Fig. 1(d).

The dimension of a stable (ﬁnite) longitudinal motion,
i.e., the area comprised by a separatrix, is in direct pro-
portion with ratio of the ring parameters. For the con-
sidered case of the nonlinear Hamiltonian (12), the sep-
aratrix height (size along the p axis) is determined by

Dependence of the phase and momentum separatrix
extensions on rf amplitude at ﬁxed other parameters,
which values are listed in Tab. I, is presented in Fig. 2.
As it can be seen from the plot in Fig. 2, while in-
creasing the parameter Urf the separatrix height grows
up reaching its maximum, ∆p ≈ 7.1 × 10−2, at Urf(c) ≈
3.8 × 10−4 (which is equal to the rf voltage of V(c) ≈
16.3 kV at γs = 84).

With further increase in the rf voltage, the separatrix

height remains constant.

The separatrix width remains constant with increase
of the rf voltage up to the critical value Urf(c), then it is
diminishing.

In Fig. 3, a dependence of the separatrix dimensions
upon the linear momentum compaction factor under
other system parameters ﬁxed is presented.

compaction factor, ∆φ = ∆φ(α0), is increasing while
α0 grows. At a certain critical value of the linear mo-
mentum compaction factor α0(c) (in the suggested case
α0(c) ≈ 0.03 ), the width of equilibrium area has reached
its maximum and remains constant with further increase
in α0. A dependence of the separatrix height on α0 is
of increasing within interval 0 ≤ α0 ≤ α0(c). Then, af-
ter the maximum at α0 = α0(c) this dependence becomes
declining, coming to zero at a large α0.

Since the phase volume enclosed within the separatrix
(and, therefore, the storage ring acceptance) is propor-
tional to product of the transverse dimensions of the sep-
aratrix, σ ∼ ∆p∆φ, then from comparison of the plots in
Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 it follows that optimal working point is
about the critical parameters.

In addition, it can be seen that, dislike a linear lat-
tice, nonlinear terms in the momentum compaction fac-
tor restrict the inﬁnite increase of energy acceptance
with decreasing of the linear momentum compaction fac-
tor: The acceptance increase takes place while the linear
compaction is above certain critical value α0(c), which is
determined by the ring lattice parameters according to

To validate use of diﬀerential (smoothed) equations of
motion (10) for analysis of Compton storage rings, a code
has been developed based on the ﬁnite diﬀerence equa-
tions (7). A simulated phase space portrait at the ring
parameters listed in Tab. I for µ ≥ µc is presented in
Fig. 4.

From the ﬁgure it follows that the electrons can be
conﬁned within not only the “linear” area (minimum
of Hamilton function (12)), but the “nonlinear” as well.
(The nonlinear stable region disappears in a linear lat-
tice.) RMS sizes and the center of weight positions per-
fectly correspond to the analytical estimations presented
above.

momentum compaction factor presented in the paper,
can be digested as follows:

• Grounded on a simpliﬁed model of the storage ring,
the ﬁnite-diﬀerence equations were derived. Hamil-
tonian treatment of the phase space structure was
performed. As was shown, the structure of the
phase space is governed by ratios of the ring pa-
rameters. An analytical expression for the factor
µ, which determines the topology of the longitudi-
nal phase space, was derived.

• Dependencies of the sizes of the equilibrium areas of
the synchrotron motion in a nonlinear lattice were
derived. Analysis of dependence of the longitudinal
acceptance upon the amplitude of rf voltage, and
the linear compaction factor at the ﬁxed quadratic
nonlinear term was presented. As was shown, the
acceptance is growing up only to a deﬁnite magni-
tude which determines by the critical value of pa-
rameter µ = µc. It was emphasized that in order to
maximize the acceptance of a lattice with a small
linear momentum compaction factor and a wide en-
ergy spread of electrons in the bunches, the system
parameters should be chosen close to the critical
value of µ.

• To validate the use of smoothed equations of mo-
tion, a simulating code was developed. The code
is based on the ﬁnite-diﬀerence equations. The re-
sults of simulation manifest a good agreement with
the theoretical predictions on the sizes and position
of equilibrium areas.

The results obtained allow to make the following con-
clusion: Enlargement of the energy acceptance of a ring
by decreasing of the momentum compaction factor is lim-
ited with the nonlinearity in the compaction factor. De-
creasing of the linear compaction factor below the certain
limit causes the reversed eﬀect — decreasing of the ac-
ceptance.

Similar consequence corresponds to the build–up of the
rf voltage: Increase of the voltage above a certain limit
causes narrowing of possible bunch lengthes while the
energy acceptance remains constant. This eﬀect can lead
to decrease in the injection eﬃciency for high rf voltages.

Abstract

This paper presents results for the electric ﬁeld due to a uniformly

charged elliptical beam in the region outside the beam.

Introduction

This paper presents results for the electric ﬁeld due to a uniformly charged
elliptical beam outside the beam. Results for the ﬁeld inside inside the beam
are well known [1, 2] The beam being considered extends indeﬁnitly in the z
direction and has an elliptical boundary in x and y given by

x2/a2 + y2/b2 = 1

(1)

The charge density, ρ(x, y, z) is uniform within the elliptical boundary, zero
outside the elliptical boundary, and does not depend on z. The results given
below depend on the observation made by B. Houssais [3], that the result for
the electric ﬁeld of a gaussian charge distribution given by W. Kellog [1] as
a one dimensional integral would hold for any elliptical charge distribution
as deﬁned below. This may be stated as follows. Let the charge distribution
be given as

ρ(x, y, z) = λn(x, y)

A charge distribution will be called elliptical if n(x, y) can be written as

where λ is the charge per unit length and

dxdy n(x, y) = 1

Z

n(x, y) = ˆn(T )/πab

T = x2/a2 + y2/b2

ˆn(T ) = 1, T ≤ 1
ˆn(T ) = 0, T > 1

ˆn(T ) = exp(−T )

For the uniform elliptical beam , ˆn(T ) is given by

For a Gaussian beam, ˆn(T ) is given by

One can show, using Eq. 3, that ˆn(T ) obeys the equation

The generalization of the Kellog result for any elliptical beam is then

A similar result, with a, b and x, y interchanged will give Ey

Electric ﬁelds for x,y inside the beam

As a ﬁrst step, the ﬁelds inside a uniformly charged elliptical beam will be
found using Eq. 8 .In this case, ˆT is always ≤ 1 since for t = 0 , ˆT =
x2/a2 + y2/b2, which is ≤ 1 for x,y inside the beam, and decreases further for
larger t. Eq. 8 then becomes

and a similar result for Ey with a and b interchanged and x replaced by y.

Electric ﬁelds outside the beam when y = 0

As the next step, the ﬁelds outside a uniformly charged elliptical beam will
be found using Eq. 8 for the case when y = 0. The results in this case are
simpler and the mathematics is easier to comprehend. In this case, ˆT is > 1
for t = 0 since for t = 0 , ˆT = x2/a2 + y2/b2, which is > 1 for x,y outside
the beam. For larger t, ˆT decreases and reaches the vaue of 1 at t = t1,
and at still larger t, ˆT decreases further always remaining smaller than 1.The
integral in Eq. 8 then goes from t = t1, to t = ∞. Eq. 8 then becomes

Electric ﬁelds outside the beam when y 6= 0

As the ﬁnal step, the ﬁelds outside a uniformly charged elliptical beam will
be found using Eq. 8 for the general case. In this case, ˆT is > 1 for t = 0
since for t = 0 , ˆT = x2/a2 + y2/b2, which is > 1 for x,y outside the beam.
For larger t, ˆT decreases and reaches the vaue of 1 at t = t1, and at still
larger t, ˆT decreases further always remaining smaller than 1.The integral in
Eq. 8 then goes from t = t1, to t = ∞. Eq. 8 then becomes

Ex = 2λx

(a2 + t)3/2(b2 + t)1/2

x2/(a2 + t1) + y2/(b2 + t1) = 1

t1 is the positive root of the equation

x2/(a2 + t1) + y2/(b2 + t1) = 1

The quadratic equation for t1, Eq. 17, can be solved to give

t1 = (B2/4 + C)1/2 + B/2
B = x2 + y2 − a2 − b2
C = x2b2 + y2a2 − a2b2

Eq. 16 gives the result for Ex

Ex = 4λx

(a2 + t1)1/2 + (b2 + t1)1/2

and a similar result for Ey with a and b interchanged and x replaced by y.
It may be usefull to also have results for the derivatives of the ﬁelds,
Exx, Eyy, Exy = Eyx, where Exx = ∂Ex/∂x, Eyy = ∂Ey/∂y and Exy =
∂Ex/∂y. Exx is found using Eq. 16 for Ex

Eyy and dt1/dy can be found by interchanging x and y, and a and b. Exy can
be found in the same way as

Exy = −4λxy

(a2 + t1)1/2(b2 + t1)1/2
x2(b2 + t1)2 + y2(a2 + t1)2

Abstract

A kinetic equation for the joint probability distribution for ﬁxed values of the
classical action, momentum and density has been derived. Further the hydro-
dynamic equations of continuity and balance of momentum density have been
transformed into a Schroedinger-like equation, describing particle motion in an
eﬀective electro-magnetic ﬁeld and an expression for the gauge potentials has
been obtained.

1 Introduction

The dynamics of particles in accelerators and storage rings is usually studied on the basis of
deterministic causal tools, provided by Hamilton’s equations of motion. There are, however,
a number of instances where such a description fails or may not be adequate.

The beam circulating in an accelerator may be generally considered as an ensemble of
nonlinear oscillators. Even in the case when the beam is not dominated by space charge
these oscillators are weakly coupled at least linearly. This coupling is due to direct in-
teraction between particles, thus revealing the discrete nature of their correlations and/or
an interaction between them via the surroundings. In an experiment involving macroscopic
measuring devices the observed quantities are a restricted number of variables characterizing
the macroscopic state of the beam. Since the beam consists of a large number of randomly
moving particles the macroscopic quantities are subject to deviations around certain mean
values. These deviations appearing to an observer as random events are called ﬂuctuations.
Therefore the particle beam propagates in response to ﬂuctuations, automatically implied
by the existence of many degrees of freedom. Fluctuating contributions remain small in
comparison with the macroscopic quantities for systems in thermodynamic equilibrium [1],
except at critical points. When a certain dynamic (or plasma) instability is encountered,
ﬂuctuations are expected to grow considerably. As a result the corresponding macroscopic
evolution exhibits abrupt changes of various thermodynamic parameters.

In the light of the above considerations we analyze in the present paper the motion of
a test particle in the bath provided by the rest of the beam. Microscopically, each particle
feels the ﬂuctuating ﬁeld (due to electro-magnetic and other possible interactions) produced
by all the other particles in the beam, and therefore it constantly undergoes Brownian
motion in phase space. The coeﬃcients in the resulting Fokker-Planck equation contain the
ﬂuctuation spectrum of the interparticle interactions [2, 3]. We are not going to calculate
these coeﬃcients explicitly here (we hope to do so in a forthcoming paper), but rather we
study the motion of a test particle suspended in a random inhomogeneous medium under
the action of external forces. The statistical properties of the medium comprising the rest
of the beam are characterized by a random velocity ﬁeld (which may be regarded also as
a ﬂuctuating vector electro- magnetic potential) and a random potential ﬁeld. Moreover,
we consider the beam ﬂuid inviscid. The latter restriction is not essential for we presume
friction and other sources of dissipation (such as synchrotron radiation) could be without
eﬀort implemented in the development presented here.

Recently a thermal wave model for relativistic charged particle beam propagation, build-
ing on remarkable analogies between particle beam optics and non relativistic quantum
mechanics has been proposed [4]. The conjectured in Reference 4 Schroedinger-like equa-
tion for the transverse motion of azimuthally symmetric beams has been derived [5] in the
framework of Nelson’s stochastic mechanics. Further development of the model suitable to
cover the problem of asymmetric beam propagation in accelerators can be found in [6]. In
the present paper we recover the Nelson’s scheme of stochastic mechanics for particle beams
from a diﬀerent point of view.

2 The Model of Random Beam Propagation

The classical motion of charged particles in an accelerator is described usually with respect
to a comoving with the beam reference frame. Not taking into account chromatic eﬀects
the dynamics in the longitudinal direction can be decoupled from the dynamics in a plane
transversal to the orbit. Then the evolution of the beam in 6D phase space is governed by
the Hamiltonian [7]:

H(x, p; θ) =

Rp2
2
where x = (x1, x2, x3), p = (p1, p2, p3) and θ is the azimuthal angle, commonly used in
accelerator theory as an independent variable playing the role of time. The quantity R in
equation (2.1) denotes the mean radius of the machine. The variables x3, p3 constitute a
canonical conjugate pair, responsible for the longitudinal motion of the beam

Kk(θ) is the local curvature of the orbit and the dot [as well as in equation (2.6)] stands for

The potential function U(x; θ) in equation (2.1) consists of two parts:

U(x; θ) = Ub(x1, x2; θ) + Us(x3; θ),

where Ub(x1, x2; θ) describes the transverse motion (betatron motion) and is given by

Moreover the continuous distribution of trajectories with associated density ̺(x; θ) obeys
the continuity equation

and in addition, taking the gradient of equation (2.11) we obtain an equation for p(x; θ)

Thus the system (2.14), (2. 15) [or equivalently (2.11) and (2.14)] represents a closed set of
equations, describing the Hamilton-Jacobi ﬂuid as a mechanical system living in conﬁgura-
tion space [8].

Let us consider the motion of a test particle in the ﬂuid comprised by the rest of the beam.
No dissipative forces of Stokes type are present, as soon as we assume the beam ﬂuid to be
inviscid. However, the discrete nature of collisions between particles (intra-beam scattering)
give rise to kinetic ﬂuctuations in the one particle distribution function. As a consequence
the gas-dynamic functions ̺(x; θ) and p(x; θ) of the Hamilton-Jacobi ﬂuid ﬂuctuate as well.
Fluctuating contributions to the one particle distribution function are generated also by the
electro-magnetic interaction between particles in the beam. All this means that the beam
is a real medium with a ﬁnite number of particles within a physically inﬁnitesimal volume
and substituting it by a continuous medium is not justiﬁed [2]. External noise could be
introduced into the beam from the surroundings (RF noise, ﬂuctuations in the parameters
of magnetic elements, etc.), which complexiﬁes the physical picture additionally.

Leaving more speculations aside we consider the motion of our test particle in a random
inhomogeneous medium and random velocity ﬁeld. The particle dynamics is governed by
the Hamiltonian

H(x, p; θ) =

+ p · z(θ) + U(x; θ) +

U(x; θ),

(2.16)

3 Kinetic Equation for the One-Point Probability Den-

sity

We deﬁne a joint probability density for ﬁxed values of the classical action S(x; θ), of the
momentum p(x; θ) and the density of random trajectories ̺(x; θ) as

W (S, p, ̺|x; θ) = hWr(S, p, ̺|x; θ)iz,

U ,

(3.1)

where h...iz,
processes indicated.

U denotes statistical average over the ensemble of realizations of the stochastic

e

e

Note that now S(x; θ), p(x; θ) and ̺(x; θ) are random functions [more precisely, func-
U(x; θ)] according to
tionals of the random velocity ﬁeld z(θ) and the random potential
the system (2.21). A closed kinetic equation for the one-point probability density taking
into account the gas-dynamic equations (2.21) can be derived by particular choice of the
dependence of Wr on the density ̺(x; θ) [11], that is

e

Wr(S, p, ̺|x; θ) = ̺(x; θ)δ[S(x; θ) − S]δ[p(x; θ) − p].

(3.2)

Diﬀerentiating equation (3.1) with respect to “time” θ and using the gas-dynamic equations
(2.21) it is straightforward to obtain the following kinetic equation

It is worthwhile to note that if we let Wr depend on ̺(x; θ) through a generic function it
e
will turn out that the only possibility to cancel terms proportional to ∇ · p appearing in
equation (3.3) is to allow Wr be a linear function of ̺(x; θ). However, the kinetic equation
for the one-point probability density (3.1) with an arbitrary dependence on the density of
random trajectories can be found in a closed form if the Hessian matrix

e

Hmn =

∂2S(x; θ)
∂xm∂xn

(3.4)

of the classical action is included in the joint probability density [9], [10] and the system
(2.21) is supplemented with an equation for the quantity deﬁned by equation (3.4).

We still have not reached our ﬁnal goal, since the right hand side of equation (3.3) contains
the yet unknown correlators of the random velocity ﬁeld, the random potential ﬁeld and Wr.

In order to split the above mentioned correlations let us consider a generic functional R[F ]
of the random Gaussian tensor ﬁeld Fk1,...,kn(r; θ). Then the following relation holds [11] -
[13]

which is known as the Furutsu-Novikov formula. In (3.5) r collects all the continuous ar-
guments of the random tensor ﬁeld, δ/δFm1,...,mn(r) denotes the functional derivative with
respect to the random ﬁeld and summation over repeated indices is implied. To apply the
Furutsu- Novikov formula (3.5) we need the functional derivatives of S(x; θ), ̺(x; θ) and
p(x; θ) with respect to the random velocity ﬁeld z(θ) and the random potential
U(x; θ).

A(x, y; θ) = A(θ) + Bk(θ)(xk − yk) +

Ckm(θ)(xk − yk)(xm − ym) + · · · .

(3.8)

Without loss of generality the ﬁrst term in the Taylor expansion (3.8) of the correlation
function can be taken equal to zero, since it does not contribute to the dynamics (it embeds
the gauge properties of the random potential ﬁeld and can be scaled to zero). Thus we ﬁnally
arrive at the desired kinetic equation for the one- point probability density:

exclude the classical action from consideration. We get

v(−)(x; θ) = v(x; θ) + u(x; θ)

(3.21)

has been introduced. One can immediately recognize in the left hand side of equation (3.20a)
the mean backward derivative [8, 14, 15] of the forward velocity

D(−)v(+)n(x; θ) = −R∇nU −

∇kGkn.

(3.20)

h̺i

Perform now “time” inversion transformation in equation (3.20) according to the relations
[8]:

θ −→ θ′ = −θ

;

x(θ) −→ x′(θ′) = x(θ)

;

v(θ) −→ v′(θ′) = −v(θ).

(3.22)

As a consequence of (3.22) one has

∂
∂θ′ = −

∂

;

∇x′ = ∇x

∇v′ = −∇v.

(3.23a)

In addition the forward and backward velocities and mean derivatives are transformed as
follows [8]

v(±)(x; θ) −→ v′

(±)(x′; θ′) = −v(∓)(x; θ),

(3.23b)

D(±)f ′(x′; θ′) = −D(∓)f (x; θ),
where f (x; θ) is a generic function. Since the internal stress tensor Gkn is a dynamic char-
acteristic of motion under time inversion its divergence changes sign. This also follows from
the particular form of the “collision integral” [the right hand side of the kinetic equation
(3.7)]. Therefore from (3.20) with (3.22) and (3.23) in hand we obtain

(3.23c)

D(+)v(−)n(x; θ) = −R∇nU +

∇kGkn.

(3.24)

Equations (3.20) and (3.24) provide us two opportunities. First, summing them up we
express the transport equation for the momentum density in terms of the current and osmotic
velocities as

∇k∇mu.

(3.25)

This is nothing else but the Nelson’s stochastic generalization of Newton’s law [8, 14, 15].
Secondly, subtracting equations (3.20) and (3.24) we obtain an equation for the internal
stress tensor to be determined, that is:

+ (v · ∇)un − (u · ∇)vn +

∇k∇mvn =

∇kGkn.

∇1(∇1 · v1)

(3.27)

relating the current and osmotic velocity (which is a direct consequence of Fick’s law and
the continuity equation) we arrive at the following expression for the internal stress tensor:

Resuming the results of the present section it should be mentioned that the continuity
equation (3.11) and the transport equation for the momentum density (3.19) are equivalent
to Nelson’s scheme of stochastic mechanics. Let us also note that the characteristics of
the ﬂuctuating beam medium, embedded in the random potential (2.18) do not enter the
simple hydrodynamic approximation procedure adopted here up to the second moment. It
remains, however to analyze the corrections to the evolution law of the Madelung ﬂuid by
taking into account the balance equation for the kinetic energy density. This can be done
by employing more complete closure techniques to accomplish the transition between kinetic
and hydrodynamic description.

4 The Schroedinger-Like Equation

Our starting point is the system of partial diﬀerential equations (3.13), (3.14) and (3.25)
derived in the preceding section, which in fact represents the set of equations describing the
evolution of the Madelung ﬂuid in stochastic mechanics [8, 15]. Following [6] we perform a

5 Concluding Remarks

In the present paper we have studied the motion of a test particle in a random inhomogeneous
medium comprised by the rest of the beam. As a result of the investigation performed we
have shown that Nelson’s scheme of stochastic mechanics for particle beams in the case of
zero friction, is equivalent to hydrodynamic approximation in the kinetic equation for the one
particle distribution function up to the second moment. Further, it has been pointed out that
the hydrodynamic equations of continuity and momentum density can be transformed by a
change of coordinates and dependent variables into a Schroedinger-like equation. Regardless
of the type of the external forces one need to introduce a gauge electro-magnetic ﬁeld. If the
beam constitutes an isotropic medium (holding in the case of symmetric beams) the gauge
vector potential vanishes and as a consequence the scalar potential is equal to the potential
that accounts for the external force.

The gauge transformation (4.16) is the well-known transformation in classical electro-
magnetic theory [17] introduced by Weyl,
indicating a transition to alternative electro-
magnetic potentials, which sometimes are easier to ﬁnd compared to the original ones. Be-
sides that, the transformed potentials deﬁne the same electro-magnetic ﬁeld tensor. Taking
into account this fact we have found the gauge electro-magnetic potentials explicitly, depend-
ing on the solution of a Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the classical motion of the particle in
the anharmonic part of the external potential.

The beam circulating in an accelerator consists of a large number of particles. Obviously,
all of them cannot be in the same micro-state. As a result the beam itself generates noise,
which plays a role similar to the role of perturbation in stability theory. The essential
diﬀerence is that here the perturbation is produced by the macroscopic system itself (in
addition to the noise introduced from the surroundings).
In the present work we have
adopted a phenomenological approach to describe beam ﬂuctuations. In this connection it
remains to compute the statistical properties of the beam medium in terms of the ﬂuctuation
spectrum, which we hope to perform in a forthcoming paper.

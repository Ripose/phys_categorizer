Abstract
A dedicated clinical synchrotron facility for cancer ther-
apy using energetic proton and ion beams (C, He and O)
has been designed at GSI for the Radiologische Univer-
sit¨atsklinik at Heidelberg, Germany. The design of the
injector linac is presented. Suitable ion sources are dis-
cussed and results of ion source test measurements are re-
ported. The LEBT allows for switching between two ion
sources. A short RFQ accelerates the ions from 8 keV/u to
400 keV/u. It is followed by a very compact beam match-
ing section and a 3.8 m long IH-type drift tube linac for the
acceleration to 7 MeV/u. Both rf structures are designed for
a resonance frequency of 216.816 MHz and for ion mass-
to-charge ratios A/q ≤ 3 (12C4+, H3

+, 3He+, 16O6+).

INTRODUCTION

Since December 1997 nearly 70 patients have been treated
successfully with energetic carbon ion beams within the
GSI cancer treatment program. Advanced technologies
like the intensity-controlled rasterscan method for 3-di-
mensionally conformal tumor treatment using pencil-like
ion beams and an active control of the beam intensity, en-
ergy, position and width during the irradiation have been
developed [1, 2]. The developments and experiences of this
program led to a proposal for a hospital-based ion acceler-
ator facility for the clinic in Heidelberg [3]. It consists of
a 7 MeV/u injector linac and a 6.5 Tm synchrotron [4] to
accelerate the ions to ﬁnal energies of 50 to 430 MeV/u.

Three treatment areas (two isocentric ion gantries and one
ﬁxed horizontal beam line) are proposed to treat about 1000
patients/year. To cover the speciﬁc medical requirements,
the accelerator facility is designed to deliver both beams
of low-LET (linear energy transfer) ions (p, He) and high-
LET ions (C, O). The requested maximum beam intensities
at the irradiation point are 1 × 109 carbon ions/spill and
4 × 1010 protons/spill. Only active and no passive beam
delivery systems are planned.

2 INJECTOR LAYOUT

A compact injector linac with a total length of about 13 m
has been designed (Fig. 1 and Table 1). To provide a fast
switching between low and high-LET ion beams, the ana-
lyzed beams from two ion sources running in parallel can
be selected by a switching magnet before injection into the
rf linac. For the production of the high-LET ion beams
an ECR ion source (ECRIS) is proposed. For the produc-
tion of the low-LET ion beams the installation either of
an ECRIS of the same type or of a much more compact,
cheaper and simpler gas discharge ion source is discussed.
To form short beam pulses, a fast macropulse chopper
will be used in the common straight section of the LEBT
line. For the intensity-controlled rasterscan method differ-
ent beam intensities within an intensity range of 1/1000
are requested for each individual synchrotron cycle. The
required controlled beam intensity variation will be per-
formed already along the LEBT line by changing the driv-
ing currents of the quadrupole triplet magnets following
each spectrometer section from pulse to pulse.

The 21 MV rf linac [5] is designed for ion mass-to-
charge ratios A/q ≤ 3 and an operating frequency of
216.816 MHz. It has a total length of only about 5.5 m
and consists of two cavities — a short RFQ structure and
an efﬁcient IH-type drift tube linac. For stripping off the
remaining electrons prior to injection of the ions into the
synchrotron, a thin foil stripper located about 1 m behind
of the DTL is used for all ion species.

To avoid contaminations of the helium ion beams with
ions from other elements having the same A/q, the use of
3He instead of 4He is proposed. To reduce space-charge ef-
fects along the complete injector linac in case of hydrogen
ion beams and to increase the extraction voltage of the ion
+
source, the production and acceleration of molecular H2
+ ion beams is planned. The molecules are breaking
or H3
up into protons at the stripper foil.

ION SOURCES

To achieve the demanded beam intensities at the irradiation
point with only moderate requirements for the ion sources,
a multiturn-injection procedure with an accumulation fac-
tor of 10 is proposed for the synchrotron. Considering
reasonable loss factors for the complete accelerator chain
and the beam lines, the ion currents required from the ion
sources range from roughly 100 eµA O6+ to about 650 µA
H2

+ (Table 2).

3.1 ECR ion source

A high-performance 14.5 GHz fully permanent magnet
ECRIS called SUPERNANOGAN has been developed at
GANIL [6] and is commercially available from PAN-
TECHNIK S.A., France. To check the suitability of the
source for the therapy injector, test measurements have
been performed at the ECRIS test bench at GANIL. The
required ion currents could be exceeded by at least 50 %
(C4+, H2
+) up to a factor of about 3 (O6+, He1+) in a sta-
ble DC operating mode. The rf power transmitted by the
rf generator was about 100 W for the extraction of 1.1 mA
He1+ up to about 420 W for a 200 eµA C4+ beam. The
measured normalized 90 % transverse beam emittances are

< 0.5 π mm mrad for 280 eµA O6+, about 0.6 – 0.65
π mm mrad for C4+ and He1+,2+ and roughly 0.7 π mm
mrad for a 1.5 mA proton beam.
In the latter case, the
measured values may be limited by the acceptance of the
spectrometer system at GANIL. During the tests, some
high-voltage problems occurred above an extraction volt-
age of about 20 kV. Meanwhile, these problems have been
analyzed by PANTECHNIK and some improvements will
be tested soon. The solution of these problems is essen-
tial for the therapy injector since extraction voltages of up
to 24 kV are required for a beam energy of 8 keV/u (Ta-
ble 2). However, alternative high-performance ECR ion
sources using electromagnets are available, which can be
operated at the required source potentials. For instance, the
ECR4-M type ECRIS available from PANTECHNIK or the
10 GHz NIRS-ECR operated at HIMAC.

3.2 Gas discharge ion source
Besides economical reasons, a gas discharge ion source op-
timized for the production of singly charged ions has sev-
eral advantages. In contrast to ECR ion sources, where the
+ fraction of the extracted hydrogen ion beams is only a
H3
few percent, it can be optimized to more than 90 % in case
of a gas discharge ion source at low arc currents [7, 8, 9].
+ ion beams has the important ad-
The acceleration of H3
vantage that the rf power levels in the linac cavities can
be identical in case of 12C4+ and for hydrogen ion beams.
Hence, faster switching between both beams would be pos-
sible as well as a very stable and reliable operation of the
cavities. Furthermore, higher ion currents can be extracted
easily and very high beam qualities are achieved. For ex-
ample, for a 9 mA He+ beam extracted with an extraction
voltage of 17 kV a normalized 80 % transverse beam emit-
tance of 0.003 π mm mrad was measured using the high-
current high-brilliance gas discharge ion source developed
at the Institut f¨ur Angewandte Physik (IAP) at the Univer-
sity of Frankfurt [10]. With the same source, current densi-
ties of more than 40 mA/cm2 could be achieved easily for

4 RF LINAC

A compact four-rod like RFQ structure for the accelera-
tion from 8 keV/u to 400 keV/u has been designed at the
IAP. The electrode length is 1.35 m, the electrode voltage
is 70 kV and the expected rf peak power is about 100 kW
at a low duty cycle around 0.1 %. For matching the output
beam parameters to the values required at injection into the
IH-DTL a very compact scheme is proposed. For bunch-
ing the beam in the longitudinal phase plane a drift tube
directly following the RFQ structure will be integrated into
the RFQ tank. Results of PARMTEQ simulations of the
RFQ as well as ﬁrst results of model measurements and
MAFIA simulations regarding the integration of the drift
tube are reported in Ref. [11].

For focusing the beam in both transverse phase planes
and for correction of small angular deviations of the beam
at the RFQ exit, a magnet unit consisting of an xy-steerer
and a magnetic quadrupole doublet is ﬂanged to the RFQ
tank. The unit has a total length of only 15 cm. It is fol-
lowed by a diagnostic chamber of 5 cm length, which con-
tains a capacitive phase probe and a beam transformer. The
simulation of the particle dynamics along the matching sec-
tion is included in the simulations of the RFQ and of the
IH-DTL [5, 11].

The IH-type drift tube linac for the acceleration from
0.4 MeV/u to 7 MeV/u consists of four KONUS [12] sec-
tions housed in the same cavity of about 3.8 m in length
and 30 cm in diameter [5, 13]. It consists of 56 accelerat-
ing gaps and three integrated magnetic quadrupole triplet
lenses. The expected rf peak power is about 1 MW. To
achieve an approximately constant maximum on-axis elec-
tric ﬁeld of about 18 MV/m along the whole structure, the
gap voltage distribution is ramped from about 200 kV at
the low-energy end to about 480 kV at maximum. By care-
ful optimization of the individual KONUS sections, the ac-
ceptance of the structure was increased to about 1.3 π mm
mrad (norm.) in the transverse phase planes, and to about
3.0 π ns keV/u in the longitudinal plane.

Behind the IH-DTL the beam is focused on the strip-
per foil by another magnetic quadrupole triplet. The par-
ticle distributions at the stripper foil resulting from parti-
cle tracking simulations along the DTL using the LORASR
code are presented in Fig. 2. The particle distributions used
at injection into the DTL have been matched to the results
of the RFQ simulations. The 95 % emittance areas at DTL
injection are 1.3 π ns keV/u in the longitudinal phase plane
and 0.7 π mm mrad (norm.) in both transverse planes. The
transverse beam emittances are based on the values mea-
sured for the ECR ion sources under discussion. The rela-
tive growth of the 95 % ellipse areas along the DTL is about
22 % in all three phase space projections, the rms emittance
growth amounts to about 10 % in each plane. Beam en-
velopes along the DTL have been presented already in ear-
lier publications [5, 13]. The current limit for the IH-DTL

lipses contain 95 % of the particles.

for ions with A/q = 3 resulting from beam dynamics sim-
ulations is larger than 20 eµA [13]. The momentum spread
of the ion beam at the stripper foil is about ±0.15 %. It will
be increased due to energy-straggling effects in the foil. To
enhance the injection efﬁciency into the synchrotron, the
momentum spread will be reduced to ≤ ±0.1 % by a de-
buncher cavity installed in the synchrotron injection beam
line. An 1:2 scaled rf model of the IH-DTL structure is
designed at present at GSI. First model measurements are
scheduled for the second quarter of the next year.

The energy and momentum densities of the ﬁelds of a free
electron in a plane electromagnetic wave include interference
terms that are the classical version of the “dressing” of the
electron the arises in a quantum analysis. The transverse me-
chanical momentum of the oscillating electron is balanced by
the ﬁeld momentum resulting from the interference between
the driving wave and the static part of the electron’s ﬁeld.
The interference between the wave and the oscillating part
of the electron’s ﬁeld leads to a longitudinal ﬁeld momentum
and a negative ﬁeld energy that compensate for the longi-
tudinal momentum and kinetic energy of the electron. The
interference terms are dominated by the near zone, so that as
the wave passes the electron by the latter reverts to its energy
and momentum prior to the arrival of the wave.

I. INTRODUCTION

The behavior of a free electron in a electromagnetic
wave is one of the most commonly discussed topics in
classical electromagnetism. Yet, several basic issues re-
main to be clariﬁed. These relate to the question: to
what extent can net energy be transferred from an elec-
tromagnetic pulse (such as that of a laser) in vacuum to
a free electron?

These issues are made more complex by quantum con-
siderations, including the role of the “quasimomentum”
of an electron that is “dressed” by an electromagnetic
wave [1].

As a small step towards understanding of the larger is-
sues, we consider a simpler question here. The response
of a free electron to a plane electromagnetic wave is oscil-
latory motion in the plane perpendicular to the direction
of the wave, in the ﬁrst approximation. Thus, the elec-
tron has momentum transverse to the direction of the
wave. However, the wave contains momentum only in
its direction, and the radiated wave contains no net mo-
mentum (in the nonrelativistic limit). How is momentum
conserved in this process?

The general sense of the answer has been given by
Poynting [2], who noted that an electromagnetic ﬁeld can
be said to contain a ﬂux of energy (energy per unit area
per unit time) given by

S =

cE × B

4π

,

(1)

magnetic ﬁeld (taken to be in vacuum throughout this
paper) and c is the speed of light.

Poincar´e [3] noted that this ﬂow of energy can also be

associated with a momentum density given by

Pﬁeld =

S
c2 =

E × B
4πc

,

(2)

Hence, in the problem of a free electron in a plane electro-
magnetic wave we are led to seek an electromagnetic ﬁeld
momentum that is equal and opposite to the mechanical
momentum of the electron.

In this paper we demonstrate that indeed the mechan-
ical momentum of the oscillating electron is balanced by
the ﬁeld momentum in the interference term between the
incident wave and the static ﬁeld of the electron. We are
left with some subtleties when we consider the interfer-
ence between the incident wave and the oscillating ﬁeld
of the electron.

II. GENERALITIES

A. Motion of an Electron in a Plane Wave

We consider a plane electromagnetic wave that prop-
agates in the +z direction of a rectangular coordinate
system. A fairly general form of this wave is

Ewave = ˆxEx cos(kz − ωt) − ˆyEy sin(kz − ωt),
Bwave = ˆxEy sin(kz − ωt) + ˆyEx cos(kz − ωt),

(3)

where ω = kc is the angular frequency of the wave, k =
2π/λ is the wave number and ˆx is a unit vector in the
x direction, etc. When either Ex or Ey is zero we have
a linearly polarized wave, while for Ex = ±Ey we have
circular polarization.
A free electron of mass m oscillates in this ﬁeld such
that its average position is at the origin. This simple
statement hides the subtlety that our frame of reference
is not the lab frame of an electron that is initially at rest
but which is overtaken by a wave [4–6]. If the velocity of
the oscillating electron is small, we can ignore the v/c×B
force and take the motion to be entirely in the plane z =
0. Then, (also ignoring radiation damping) the equation
of motion of the electron is

in Gaussian units, where E is the electric ﬁeld, B is the

m¨x = eEwave(0, t) = e(ˆxEx cos ωt + ˆyEy sin ωt).

(4)

Using eq. (3) we ﬁnd the position of the electron to be

B. Field Momentum

x = −

e
mω2 (ˆxEx cos ωt + ˆyEy sin ωt),

and the mechanical momentum of the electron is

pmech = m ˙x =

e
ω

(ˆxEx sin ωt − ˆyEy cos ωt).

(5)

(6)

The root-mean-square (rms) velocity of the electron is

vrms = ph ˙x2 + ˙y2i =
The condition that the v/c × B force be small is then

where the dimensionless measure of ﬁeld strength, η, is
a Lorentz invariant. Similarly, the rms departure of the
electron from the origin is

xrms =

eErms
mω2 =

.

(9)

Thus, condition (8) also insures that the extent of the mo-
tion of the electron is small compared to a wavelength,
and so we may use the dipole approximation when con-
sidering the ﬁelds of the oscillating electron.

In the weak-ﬁeld approximation, we can now use (6)
for the velocity to evaluate the second term of the Lorentz
force:

e

c × B =

e2(E2

x − E2
y )
2mωc

ˆz sin 2ωt.

(10)

This term vanishes for circular polarization, in which case
the motion is wholely in the transverse plane. However,
for linear polarization the v/c × B force leads to oscilla-
tions along the z axis at frequency 2ω, as ﬁrst analyzed
in general by Landau [7]. For polarization along the ˆx
axis, the x-z motion has the form of a “ﬁgure 8”, which
for weak ﬁelds (η ≪ 1) is described by
e2E2
x

x = −
If the electron had been at rest before the arrival of
the plane wave, then inside the wave it would move with
an average drift velocity given by

eEx
mω2 cos ωt,

z = −

8m2ω3c

sin 2ωt.

(11)

The ﬁelds associated with the electron can be regarded
as the superposition of those of an electron at rest at
the origin plus those of a dipole consisting of the actual
oscillating electron and a positron at rest at the origin.
Thus, we can write the electric ﬁeld of the electron as
Estatic + Eosc and the magnetic ﬁeld as Bosc, where the
oscillating ﬁelds have the pure frequency ω in the low-
velocity limit.

The entire electromagnetic momentum density can

then be written

Pﬁeld =

(Ewave + Estatic + Eosc) × (Bwave + Bosc)

4πc

. (13)

However, in seeking the ﬁeld momentum that opposes
the mechanical momentum of the electron, we should
not include either of the self-momenta Ewave × Bwave or
(Estatic + Eosc) × Bosc. The former is independent of the
electron, while the latter can be considered as a part of
the mechanical momentum of the electron according to
the concept of “renormalization”.

We therefore restrict our attention to the interaction

ﬁeld momentum

Pint = Pwave,static + Pwave,osc,

(14)

where

and

Pwave,static =

Estatic × Bwave

4πc

.

(15)

Pwave,osc =

Ewave × Bosc + Eosc × Bwave

4πc

.

(16)

We recall from eqs. (6) and (11) that the transverseme-
chanical momentum of the oscillating electron has pure
frequency ω. Since the wave and the oscillating part
of the electron’s ﬁeld each have frequency ω, the term
Pwave,osc contains harmonic functions of ω2, which can
be resolved into a static term plus ones in frequency
2ω. Hence we should not expect this term to cancel
the mechanical momentum. Rather, we look to the term
Pwave,static, since this has pure frequency ω.

(12)

The static ﬁeld of the electron at the origin is, in rect-

angular coordinates,

along the direction of the wave vector, as ﬁrst deduced
by McMillan [8].
In the present paper we work in the
frame in which the electron has no average velocity along
the z axis. Therefore, prior to its encounter with the
plane wave the electron had been moving in the negative
z direction with speed given by (12).

Estatic =

e
r3 (xˆx + y ˆy + zˆz),

(17)

where r is the distance from the origin to the point of
observation. Combing this with eq. (3) we have

4πcr3{−ˆxzEx cos(kz − ωt)
+ˆyzEy sin(kz − ωt)
(18)
+ˆz[xEx cos(kz − ωt) − yEy cos(kz − ωt)]}.
When we integrate this over all space to ﬁnd the total
ﬁeld momentum, the terms in ˆz vanish as they are odd
in either x or y. Likewise, after expanding the cosine and
sine of kz − ωt, the terms proportional to z cos kz vanish
on integration. The remaining terms are thus

It is noteworthy that the integration is independent
of any hypothesis as to the size of a classical elec-
tron.
Indeed, the integrand of (19) can be expressed
as cos θ sin(kr cos θ)/r2 via the substitution z = r cos θ.
Hence, the integral over a spherical shell is independent
of r for kr ≪ 1, and signiﬁcant contributions to the inte-
gral occur for radii up to one wavelength of the electro-
magnetic wave. This contrasts with the self-momentum
density of the electron which is formally divergent; if the
integration is cut oﬀ at a minimum radius (the classical
electron radius), the dominant contribution occurs within
twice that radius.

Thus, we have demonstrated the principal result of this

paper.

IV. THE MOMENTUM PWAVE

OSC

,

Several subtleties in the argument appear when we
consider the other interference term in the momentum
density (14). For this we must ﬁrst display the electro-
magnetic ﬁelds of an oscillating electron.

A. The Fields Eosc and Bosc

Since we restrict our attention to an electron that os-
cillates with amplitude much less than a wavelength of
the driving wave, and the electron attains velocities that
are much less than the speed of light, it is suﬃcient to
use the dipole approximation to the ﬁelds of the electron.
While these ﬁelds are well known, they are typically pre-
sented in imaginary notation, of which only the real part
has physical signiﬁcance. This notation is very useful
for discussions in which only time-averaged behavior is
of interest. However, we wish to consider the details of
momentum balance at an arbitrary moment, and it is
preferable to use purely real notation.

We begin by noting that the retarded vector potential
of the oscillating electron at a point r at time t can be
written

Aosc(r, t) =

lating part of the scalar potential is obtained by integra-
tion of the Lorentz gauge condition:

The constant static potential is omitted in the above.

The scalar potential could also be deduced from the
retarded potential of a moving charge. Equation (22)
results on expanding the retarded distance to ﬁrst order
in the ﬁeld strength of the plane wave.

The electric and magnetic ﬁelds are, of course, found

from the potentials via

The terms of Pwave,osc,z that are proportional to EyEy
are odd on both x and y, and so will vanish on integra-
tion.

We now consider the implications of eq. (27) separately

for waves of circular and linear polarization.

C. Circular Polarization

For a circularly polarized wave, we have E2

x = E2
y .
Consequently the dimensionless measure of ﬁeld strength
is η = eEx/mωc = eEy/mωc, according to (8). The
prefactors e2E2
y /4πmω2c can there-
fore both be written η2mc/4π, and have dimensions of
momentum.

x/4πmω2c and e2E2

The terms of eq. (27) in E2

x and E2

y can be combined

in pairs via the identities

cos(kz − ωt) cos(kr − ωt) + sin(kz − ωt) sin(kr − ωt)
(28)
= cos kz cos kr + sin kz sin kr,

and

sin(kz − ωt) cos(kr − ωt) − cos(kz − ωt) sin(kr − ωt)
(29)
= sin kz cos kr − cos kz sin kr.
A detail: the second term of eq. (27) in E2
x contains fac-
tors of x2, while second term of in E2
y contains factors
of y2. But during integration, we can replace y2 by x2,
after which the terms can be combined via (28-29).

We see already that the volume integral of Pwave,osc,z

will contain no time dependence!

On integration,

terms such as f (x, r) sin kz and
g(x, r)z cos kz that are odd in z will vanish. The inte-
grated ﬁeld momentum is thus,

pwave,osc,z = ZV

Pwave,osc,z = −

where I1 is the volume integral whose integrand is

These expressions can also be deduced from the Li´enard-
Wiechert forms for the ﬁelds of an accelerated charge,
keeping terms only to ﬁrst order in the strength of the
plane wave.

B. Components of Pwave

,

osc

Since the wave ﬁelds have no z component, the x com-

ponent of Pwave,osc is given by

Pwave,osc,x =

Ewave,yBosc,z − Eosc,zBwave,y

4πc

.

(26)

From eqs. (24) and (25) we see that both Bosc,z and Eosc,z
are odd in either x or y. Therefore, the volume integral
of Pwave,osc,x vanishes, and we do not consider it fur-
ther. Likewise, Pwave,osc,y vanishes on integration. This
conﬁrms the claim made at the end of sec. II that the
interference term Pwave,osc is not relevant to the balance
of transverse momentum between the electron and the
ﬁelds.

However, the z component of Pwave,osc does not vanish
on integration, and requires further discussion. As the
details include some surprises (to the author) I present
them at length.

(31)

We return to the signiﬁcance of eq. (30) after describ-

ing the evaluation of integral I1.

As seen from eq. (30), the integral I1 must be dimen-
sionless, although it is apparently a function of the wave
number k. However, the form of (31) indicates that I1
is actually independent of the length scale, so we can set
k = 1 during integration.

To perform the integration we consider a volume el-
ement r2dr d cos θ dφ in a spherical coordinate system
with angle θ deﬁned relative to the z axis.
It is more
convenient to keep z = r cos θ as a variable of integra-
tion, using dz = rd cos θ. Then the volume integration
has the form

ZV

−r

dφ.

(32)

Most terms of (31) are independent of φ, so their φ

integral is just 2π. For the terms in x2, we have

Z 2π

0

x2 dφ = Z r2 sin2 θ cos2 φ dφ = π(r2 − z2).

(33)

While each of the four main terms of (31) diverges
on integration, it turns out that the two terms in cos z
taken together are ﬁnite (and likewise for the two terms
in sin z). We ﬁnd that

From detailed evaluation of the radial integral, we ﬁnd
that the integrand approaches a constant value as r goes
to zero, and that the contribution to the integral at large
r diminishes as 1/r. That is, the principal contribution
is from the region kr ≈ 1.
We are left with the result (30) that the integral of the
interference term in the ﬁeld momentum density has a
constant longitudinal term for an electron oscillating in
a circularly polarized wave.

Recall that we have performed the analysis in a frame
in which the electron has no longitudinal momentum.
However, as remarked in sec. IIA, prior to its encounter
with the wave, the electron had velocity vz = −η2c/2 (as-
suming η2 ≪ 1), and therefore had initial mechanical mo-
mentum pmech,z = −η2mc/2. So, we would expect that
this initial mechanical momentum had been converted to
ﬁeld momentum, if momentum is to be conserved.

The result (30) can be described as a kind of “hidden
momentum” [9], whose appearance can be surprising if
one ignores the physical processes needed to arrive at the
nominal conditions of the problem.

We continue to be puzzled as to why the result (30) is
8/3 times larger than that required to satisfy momentum
conservation.

D. Linear Polarization

Consider now the case of a linearly polarized wave with
electric ﬁeld along the x axis. Then Erms = Ex/√2, and
the prefactors in (27) can be written as η2mc/2π.

The remaining terms

in the momentum density
Pwave,osc,z have time dependences that can be expressed

momentum to be

The constant term is the same as that found in eq. (30)
for circular polarization, and represents the initial me-
chanical momentum of the electron that became stored
in the electromagnetic ﬁeld once the electron became im-
mersed in the wave.

As for the second term of (42), recall from eq. (11)
that for linear polarization the electron oscillates along
the z axis at frequency 2ω. Hence the z component of
the mechanical momentum of the electron is

pmech,z = m ˙z = −

η2mc

2

cos 2ωt.

(43)

The term in pwave,osc,z at frequency 2ω is −4/3 of the lon-
gitudinal component of the mechanical momentum asso-
ciated with the “ﬁgure 8” motion of the electron. Thus,
we have not been completely successful in accounting for
momentum conservation when the small, oscillatory lon-
gitudinal momentum is considered.

The factors of 4/3 and 8/3 are presumably not the
same as the famous factor of 4/3 that arise in analyses of
the electromagnetic energy and momentum of the self
ﬁelds of an electron [10,11]. A further appearance of
a factor of 8/3 in the present example occurs when we
consider the ﬁeld energy of the interference terms.

V. THE INTERFERENCE FIELD ENERGY

It is also interesting to examine the electromagnetic
ﬁeld energy of an electron in a plane wave. As for the
momentum density (13), we can write

In general, the interference ﬁeld energy density is os-
cillating. Here, we look for terms that are nonzero after
averaging over time. We see at once that

hUwave,statici = 0,

(48)

since all terms have time dependence of cos ωt or sin ωt.
In contrast, hUwave,osci will be nonzero as its terms are
products of sines and cosines:

for waves of either linear or circular polarization. As
with the case of the interference ﬁeld momentum, this
interference ﬁeld energy is distributed over a volume of
order a cubic wavelength around the electron. Being an
interference term, its sign can be negative.

We can interpret the quantity,

η2m,

(52)

as compensation for the relativistic mass increase of the
oscillating electron, which scales as v2
rms/c2 and hence as
η2 (for small η, recall eq. (7)). Indeed, a general result
for the motion of an electron in a plane wave of arbitrary
strength η is that its rms relativistic mass, often called
its eﬀective mass, is [4,7]

For small η, the increase in mass is

meﬀ = mp1 + η2.

∆m ≈

η2m.

(53)

(54)

Thus, the decrease in ﬁeld energy due to the interfer-
ence terms between the electromagnetic ﬁelds of the wave
and electron is −8/3 times the mass increase it should
compensate.

VI. DISCUSSION

A. Temporary Acceleration

We remarked in sec. IIA that the preceding analysis
holds in the average rest frame of the electron. If instead
the electron had been at rest prior to the arrival of the
plane wave, the velocity of the average rest frame would
be vz = (η2/2)/(1 + η2/2). For this, the amplitude of the
plane wave is presumed to have a slow rise from zero to
a long plateau at strength η, followed by a slow decline
back to zero.

Once the wave has passed by the electron, the inter-
ference ﬁeld energy, (51), goes to zero since the integral
is dominated by the contribution at distances of order a
wavelength from the electron. Hence, the electron’s ki-
netic energy must return to zero (or to its initial value
if that was nonzero). A plane wave, or more precisely,
a long pulse that is very nearly a plane wave, cannot
transfer net energy to an electron. The acceleration of
the electron from zero velocity to vz is only temporary,
i.e., for the duration of the plane wave pulse.

This result was ﬁrst deduced by di Francia [12] and by

Kibble [4] by diﬀerent arguments.

B. The Radiation Reaction

Our analysis of the energy balance of an electron in
a plane wave is not quite complete. We have neglected
the energy radiated by the electron. Since the rate of
radiation is constant (once the electron is inside the plane
wave), the total radiated energy grows linearly with time,
and eventually becomes large. The interference energy,
(51), is constant in time, and hence cannot account for
the radiated energy.
More to follow.....

VII. APPENDIX: LI´ENARD-WIECHERT FIELDS

As an alternative to the dipole approximation, we con-
sider the use of the Li´enard-Wiechert potentials and ﬁelds
of a moving electron. We have limited our analysis to the
case of a weak plane wave (η ≪1), for which the velocity
of the electron is always small (β = v/c ≪ 1). In this
case we may approximate the time-dependent part of the
ﬁelds of the electron as proportional to the strength of
the ﬁeld of the plane wave (proportional to η. Then we
ﬁnd that the Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁelds of the electron are
the same as the ﬁelds in the dipole approximation.

We can show this in two ways. First, we verify that the
Li´enard-Wiechert potentials reduce to eqs. (20) and (22).
Second, we can verify directly that the Li´enard-Wiechert
ﬁelds are the same as eqs. (24) and (25).

The Li´enard-Wiechert potentials are

φ = (cid:20)

e

R(1 − β · ˆn(cid:21) ,

A = (cid:20)

eβ

R(1 − β · ˆn(cid:21) ,

(55)

where the electron is at postion x, the observer is at r,
their separation is R = r − x, the unit vector ˆn is R/R,
and the brackets, [ ], indicate that quantities within are
to be evaluated at the retarded time, t′ = t − R/c.
We work in the average rest frame of the electron. In
the weak-ﬁeld approximation we ignore the longitudinal
motion of the electron, (11), which is quadratic in the
strength of the plane wave. Then the velocity vector of
the electron is

β(t) =

e

mωc

(ˆxEx sin ωt − ˆyEy cos ωt) ,

(56)

from eq. (6). The retarded velocity is thus,

= −

mωc

e

[β] = β(t′ = t − R/c)

(57)
(ˆxEx sin(kR − ωt) + ˆyEy cos(kr − ωt)) .
Distance R diﬀers from r because the electron’s oscilla-
tory motion takes it away from the origin. However, the
amplitude of the motion is proportional to strength of the
plane wave. Hence, we may replace R by r in eq. (57)
with error only in the second order of ﬁeld strength.

Since the vector potential includes a factor β in the
numerator, we can replace R by r and 1 − β · ˆn by 1

7

in the ﬁrst order in the ﬁeld strength of the plane wave.
Thus,

A = −

e2

mωcr

(ˆxEx sin(kr − ωt) + ˆyEy cos(kr − ωt)) ,

(58)

in agreement with eq. (23).

In the scaler potential, we ﬁrst bring β to the numer-

ator:

e[1 + β · ˆn]

[R]

.

φ ≈

(59)

Unit vector [ˆn] diﬀers from unit vector ˆr due to the oscil-
lation of the electron, which is proportional to the ﬁeld
strength of the plane wave. For the scalar potential, how-
ever, we must expand the factor 1/[R] to ﬁrst order in
the ﬁeld strength. Now,

[R] = |r − x(t′)| = pr2 − 2r · x(t′) + x2(t′),

with

(60)

x(t′) ≈ −

e
mω2 (ˆxEx cos ωt′ + Ey cos ωt′)
e
mω2 (ˆxEx cos ω(kr − ωt) − ˆyEy cos(kr − ωt)) ,
again approximating R by r in the arguments of the co-
sine and sine, accurate to ﬁrst order in the ﬁeld strength.
Hence,

Progress on six dimensional ionization muon cooling with relatively small rings of mag-
nets is described. Lattices being explored include scaling sector cyclotrons with edge
focusing and strong focusing, ﬁxed ﬁeld alternating gradient (FFAG) rings. Ionization
cooling is provided by high pressure hydrogen gas which removes both transverse and
longitudinal momentum. Lost longitudinal momentum is replaced using radio frequency
(RF) cavities, giving a net transverse emittance reduction. The longer path length in the
hydrogen of higher momentum muons decreases longitudinal emittance at the expense
of transverse emittance. Thus emittance exchange allows these rings to cool in all six
dimensions and not just transversely. Alternatively, if the RF is located after the ring,
it may be possible to cool the muons by stopping them as they spiral adiabatically into
a central swarm. As p
0. The resulting cooled muons can lead to an intense
muon beam which could be a source for neutrino factories or muon colliders.

1. Introduction

Muons at rest have a 2.2 µs lifetime; cooling an ensemble of muons must be com-
pleted faster than that. Ionization cooling can help.1 Random muon motion is re-
moved by passage through a low Z material, such as hydrogen, and coherent motion
is added with RF acceleration. Designs to cool muons in six dimensions using linear

helical channels 2 at 100 MeV kinetic energies and using frictional cooling 3 at 1
keV kinetic energies are under investigation. A number of muon cooling rings have
been simulated at various levels.4 In a ring structure, the same magnets and RF
cavities may be reused each time a muon orbits. Transverse cooling can naturally
be exchanged for longitudinal cooling by allowing higher momentum muons to pass
through more material. Thus rings can cool in all six dimensions. The rings reported
here are the smallest to date, and are basically radial sector cyclotrons.

Small emittance bunches of cold muons are useful for a neutrino factory 5 and are
required for a muon collider.6 At a neutrino factory, accelerated muons are stored
in a racetrack to produce neutrino beams (µ− → e− ν e νµ and µ+ → e+ νe νµ).
Neutrino oscillations have been observed 7 and need more study. Further exploration
at a neutrino factory could reveal CP violation in the lepton sector,8 and will be
particularly useful if the νe to ντ coupling, θ13, is small.9 A muon collider can do
s-channel scans to split the H 0 and A0 Higgs doublet.10 Above the ILC’s 800 GeV
there are a large array of supersymmetric particles that might be produced 11 and,
if large extra dimensions exist, so could mini black holes.12 Note that the energy
resolution of a 4 TeV muon collider is not smeared by beamstrahlung.

2. Hydrogen Gas Filled Sector Cyclotrons with Internal RF

A low ﬁeld ring is being designed using ICOOL 13 for optimization and SYNCH 14
for lattices. It could be built to demonstrate six dimensional muon cooling. Rela-
tively constant β functions allow a continuous placement of the energy absorber.
Hydrogen gas cools best and also prevents breakdown in the 201 MHz RF cavities.2
Skew quadrupole magnets mix vertical and horizontal betatron oscillations. The
parameters for the ring appear in Table 1. Simulated 6D cooling is shown in Fig. 2.

where β = v/c, ǫn is the normalized emittance, β⊥ is the betatron function (focal
length) at the absorber, dEµ/ds is the energy loss, and LR is the radiation length
of the material. The ﬁrst term in this equation is the cooling term, and the second
is the heating term due to multiple scattering. This heating term is minimized if
β⊥ is small (strong-focusing) and LR is large (a low-Z absorber). The equilibrium
emittance is achieved when the heating and cooling terms balance.

A higher ﬁeld ring with smaller values of β⊥ can give a higher cooling merit
factor. Simulations show that high RF gradients are required as noted in Table 1.
A scaling ﬁxed ﬁeld, alternating gradient (FFAG) ring 15 can allow the use of
lower RF gradients and magnetic ﬁelds. For the FFAG ring in Table 1, a focusing
parameter, n = −(r/B)(dB/dr) = −0.6, was used. Each sector has a focusing-
defocusing-focusing (FDF) geometry with three magnets. There are no open slots
between sectors, so the RF cavities would have to placed within the magnets.

3. Sector Anti–Cyclotrons with External RF
An anti-cyclotron has been used to slow LEAR anti-protons at CERN.16,17 An
annular quasipotential well, U (r, z), is formed which ferries anti-protons towards the
center of an azimuthally symmetric cyclotron. The radius of the annulus decreases
with the decreasing angular momentum of the p.

U (r, z) = V (r, z) − (1/(2ηr2)) (Lg/M + η rAθ)2,

where η = e/M and Lg = Lz − e r Aθ is a generalized angular momentum. The
radial well deepens with decreasing radius and the vertical well grows shallower
(see Fig. 2 of Ref. 16). Particles must adiabatically spiral to the center. If dE/dx
is too large, particles will not stay in the magnetic wells. The ﬁnal p swarm has a
radius of 1.5 cm, a height of 4 cm, and a kinetic energy of 2 keV. A long bunch
train is coalesced into a single swarm, which is roughly the same diameter as the
incoming beam. The spiral time is 20 µs with 0.3 mbar hydrogen and about 1 µs
with 10 mbar hydrogen. Given the dependence of the cyclotron frequency on mass,
f = ω/2π = qB/2πm, the spiral time for a muon is nine time less than for a p. The
gas pressure in the center must be low, both to allow a particle to spiral all the way
in before stopping, and to allow reasonable kicker voltages for extraction. An 80 ns
electric kicker pulse rising to 500 V/cm in 20 ns is employed. The p’s move 32 cm
in 500 ns. Given that F = ma, muons will go farther.

The anti-cyclotron has now been moved from LEAR at CERN to PSI where
it is being used to slow negative muons to kinetic energies of a few keV.18 Three
centimeter diameter beams with 30 000 µ−/s below 50 keV and 0.8 cm diameter
beams with 1000 µ−/s in the 3 to 6 keV kinetic energy range are output for use.
A static electric ﬁeld continuously ejects the muons. The energy absorber and the
electrode consist of a single 30 µg/cm2 formvar foil with a 3 nm nickel ﬁlm produced
by 30 minutes of sputtering.

jected into a low ﬁeld cyclotron with four sectors like
the one in Table 1, but with soft edged magnetic ﬁelds.
The inward spirals diﬀer because of multiple scattering
and straggling. The energy loss is caused by radial LiH
wedges surrounded by hydrogen gas. The amount of mat-
ter encountered in a given orbit decreases adiabatically
with radius. The upper trace shows that vertical motion
is completely contained within
5 cm along the 70 m spi-
ral. The fractional energy loss required in the ﬁrst turn
for injection increases with the width of the muon beam
and decreases as the cyclotron’s magnetic ﬁeld is lowered.

A scaling sector anti-cyclotron could allow greater acceptance than the az-
imuthally symmetric anti-cyclotron now running at PSI. For a given R B·d ℓ, the ra-
tio of the ﬁelds in the hills and valleys can be adjusted to maximize acceptance. Only
radial and not spiral sectors have been explored so far. The sector anti-cyclotron
may be able to function as a damped harmonic oscillator to lower the amplitude
of horizontal and vertical betatron motion as a bunch train of muons spirals into
a single central swarm. With 1012 muons in a swarm, space charge is a concern. A
conductor might be used for neutralization. Movement of 1012 electrons in 100 ns
only requires 1.6 amps of current. Muons must spiral in fast enough to minimize
decay loss, but must not stop before reaching the central swarm. So, the density of
the absorber must decrease smoothly with radius. Radial LiH wedges immersed in
a gas or high to low pressure gases separated by beam pipes might meet this crite-
ria. The sector cyclotron geometry must transform into an azimuthally symmetric
magnetic bottle as the muons approach the central swarm. Otherwise, as shown
by GEANT3 simulations, muons will escape though the valleys. In the transition
region the ﬁeld might roughly resemble a hexapole or octupole ﬁeld as used in an
Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Source (ECRIS).19 Busch’s theorem (eqn. 3) 20
has the eﬀect of increasing the emittance as muons leave a magnetic ﬁeld. A half
Tesla ﬁeld and a 10 cm radius give an 8 MeV/c azimuthal kick. One might be able
to use radial iron ﬁns in the exit port to alleviate this eﬀect or reverse and increase
the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld to capture the unwanted angular momentum
in an absorber just after extraction. Using low ﬁelds with cylindrical swarms that
have small diameters works for sure. An RF quadrupole is perhaps a natural choice
for acceleration that would immediately follow the extraction electric kicker.

˙φ = [e/(2π γ m r2(s))][Φ(s) − Φk], Lz = xpy − ypx = r2γ m ˙φ = −e B r2/2 (3)

In summary, progress on large acceptance tabletop muon rings is underway,
including energy loss injection (see Fig. 4), 6D cooling, and electric kicker extraction.

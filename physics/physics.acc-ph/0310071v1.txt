Abstract

In the beam pipe of the positron Main Damping Ring (MDR) of the Next Linear
Collider (NLC), ionization of residual gases and secondary electron emission give
rise to an electron cloud which can cause the loss of the circulating beam. One path
to avoid the electron cloud is to ensure that the vacuum wall has low secondary emis-
sion yield and, therefore, we need to know the secondary emission yield (SEY) for
candidate wall coatings. We report on SEY measurements at SLAC on titanium ni-
tride (TiN) and titanium-zirconium-vanadium (TiZrV) thin sputter-deposited ﬁlms,
as well as describe our experimental setup.

1 Introduction

Beam-induced multipacting, which is driven by the electric ﬁeld of successive positively
charged bunches, arises from a resonant motion of electrons that were initially generated
or by gas ionization or by secondary emission from the vacuum wall. These electrons
then bounce back and forth between opposite walls of the vacuum chamber. The electron
cloud density depends on characteristics of the positively charged circulating beam (bunch
length, charge and spacing) and the secondary electron yield and spectrum of the wall
surface from which the starting electrons arise. The electron cloud eﬀect (ECE), due
to multipacting, has been observed or is expected at many storage rings [1]. The space
charge of the cloud, if suﬃcient, can lead to a loss of the beam or, at least, to a drastic
reduction in bunch luminosity.

In order to minimize the electron cloud problem which might arise in the NLC, we
are looking to a solution involving surface coating of the secondary electron emitting
vacuum wall. The SEY of technical surfaces has been measured in the past at SLAC [2]
[3], at CERN Fig.1 [4] [5] and in other labs [6]. In this paper we present measurements
of the SEY of materials previously measured and known to have low SEY [7] [8] [9] like
titanium-nitride thin ﬁlm (TiN) and titanium-zirconium-vanadium getter ﬁlm (TiZrV).

2 Experiment Description

The system used to measure SEY is composed of two coupled stainless steel (S/S) UHV
chambers where the pressure is in the low 10−10 Torr scale in the measurement chamber
and high 10−9 Torr scale in the ”load lock” chamber, Fig.2. Samples individually screwed
to a carrier plate, are loaded ﬁrst onto an aluminium transfer plate in the load lock
chamber, evacuated to a low 10−8 Torr scale, and then transferred to the measurement
chamber.

The measurement chamber has two electron guns and a soft (1.49 keV) x-ray source.
One electron gun (energy, 1-20 keV) is used for Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) light
element surface contamination analysis. The x-ray source is used to excite photoelectrons
for surface chemical valence analysis, called ESCA (Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical
Analysis). TiN stoichiometry is measured by ESCA technique which is also called XPS
(X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy).

The principle of XPS is to collect photoelectrons ejected by x-rays of known energy
near the surface (1 - 5 nm information depth). The emitted electrons have an energy Ek
which is given by equation 1

Ek = hν

Eb

Φ

(1)

−
where hν is the energy of the incident photon, Eb the binding energy of the electron
relative to the Fermi level of the material and Φ the spectrometer work function. The
spectrum of the measured kinetic energy gives the spectrum of the binding energy of the
photoelectrons.

−

The x-ray source is also used for exciting secondary X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) for
thickness measurement of the deposited TiN overlayers. The second electron gun (0-
3 keV) is used measure the SEY, and can also be used to electron condition the surface.

surfaces.

Figure 2: Experimental system used for surface analysis

After all samples (up to ten or so) are transferred into the measurement chamber,
one sample at a time is loaded, on its individual carrier plate, onto a manipulator arm
(Vacuum Generators ”Omniax”). The Omniaxr carrier plate holder design is shown in
Fig.4. Two thermocouples are installed on this holder plate as well as heating ﬁlament and
sample connection wires. Samples can be heated via a tungsten wire ﬁlament, Fig.3, by
radiation or by electron bombardment. Electron bombardment is achieved by biasing the
ﬁlament negatively. The Omniax sample holder is insulated from ground via an alumina
ceramic and by several thermal shield plates insulated via four sapphire balls, Fig.3 and
Fig.4.

The sample carrier plates are made of molybdenum (for attaining the highest tem-
peratures) or stainless steel, Fig.5. This plate will support one sample which is held by
corner screws onto its surface. This design allows the plate to then slide into the rails
of the Omniax plate holder, cf Fig.3. An example of an aluminium prototype carrier
plate is shown in Fig.6 and Fig.7. Note that on Fig.6 the holes for the screws are not
drilled. In this conﬁguration, the thermocouples are not attached directly to the carrier
plate but indirectly through the holder plate. Sample temperatures are compared to the
thermocouple temperatures by using a black body-calibrated infrared pyrometer (0.8 µm
- 1.3 µm bandpass) which is corrected for absorption by the 7056 glass viewport of the
measurement chamber and the sample emissivity (ǫ) of 0.2 - 0.4.

(NEG) is to record the decrease of the surface oxygen concentration with XPS. During
the NEG activation, the surface goes from an oxidized state to a partially metallic state.
The backside of the NEG was heated, directly via a hole in the plate holder, by electron
bombardment. The minimum temperature needed to activate this NEG is 180◦C [8] [11].
The thermocouples displayed a temperature of 216◦C for 2 hours. In order to determine
the temperature of the NEG, a S/S sample holder (ǫ
0.31) was heated, with a hot plate,
to various temperature with a thermocouple spot welded to it, with and without 7056
glass viewport correction. Matching the reading of the pyrometer of this experimental
calibration with the reading recorded during an in situ heating of the same S/S sample
holder allowed us to determine the actual temperature of the NEG, assuming the same
emissivity, TN EG = 232◦C. An in-situ temperature measurement with the black body
calibrated pyrometer gives for the same S/S surface 201◦C when the thermocouples on
the Omniax carrier plate holder read 216◦C.

The experimental electronic circuit is identical to the one presented in Fig. 8 [3]. The
computer controlled electron beam coming from the gun is decoupled from the target
measurement circuitry. However, the ground is common to both. In short, the target is
attached to a biasing voltage source and an electrometer connected in series to the data
gathering computer Analog Digital Converter (ADC).

3 SEY measurement methodology

In order to characterize our system, we have measured the SEY in-situ of inert gas-ion
cleaned materials: carbon, copper and gold. Results are not presented here but agree
with widely published results for ion sputter cleaned sample of these materials. After
conﬁrming the SEY from these reference materials, we proceeded to measure a TiN-coated

aluminium samples provided by BNL and a TiZrV sputter deposited ﬁlm on stainless steel
substrate, obtained from CERN, Fig.9.

Where IP is the primary current or the current leaving the electron gun and impinging
on the surface of the sample and IT is the total current measured on the sample (IT =
IP + IS). IS is the secondary electron current leaving the target.

The spectrum of secondary electron current leaving the target is composed of true
secondaries (0 eV to 40 eV, by convention), re-diﬀused primary electrons exiting after
suﬀering losses in the sample (40 eV to Ep) and from incident primary electrons (Ep)
elastically reﬂected from the surface, Fig.10. The majority of the electrons leaving the
surface are true secondaries.

In order to measure the primary current leaving the electron gun, the sample is biased
at +150 V. The bias voltage prevents all re-diﬀused and secondary electrons of less than
150 eV from leaving the sample. Elastically reﬂected electrons are not collected and could
strike nearby surfaces, creating secondary electrons that are then collected by the sample
bias. This eﬀect is small because the reﬂectivity at 100 eV is a few per cent. We estimate
the error in primary beam current measurement to be small (1-2%) because the loss of
elastics is balanced by the gain of nearby secondaries. The SEY around 100 eV for baked

7

stainless steel is close to 1.1, Fig.1. With regard to the gun current as a function of
energy, it starts at zero for zero energy and smoothly increased to its saturation value at
70 eV. We measure the magnitude and functional dependence of the beam current up to
somewhat higher value(100 eV) and use a constructed lookup table of the beam current
for SEY calculations. Not biasing the sample with a high enough voltage will lead to
an underestimation of the beam current. This is easily understood from the secondary
spectrum, Fig.10. The selected 2 nA gun current is measured for a gun energy of 0-100 eV
by energy steps of 10 eV (0-3000 eV range) or 2 eV (0-300 eV range).

Actual measurement of the SEY is done by biasing the sample to -20 V. This retarding
ﬁeld repels most secondaries from adjacent parts of the system that are excited by the
elastically reﬂected primary beam. SEY measurements are done twice, once between 0 eV
to 3000 eV with 10 eV steps, then between 0 eV to 300 eV, with 2 eV steps. The ﬁnal
energy of the primary electrons is respectively 2980 eV and 280 eV because of the bias.
The primary beam current function is measured and recorded each time before an SEY
measurement, and with the same step in energy for the electron beam. A fresh current
lookup table is created with each measurement.
The purpose of the second measurement, 0 eV to 300 eV, is to try to understand the
structure of the SEY curve at very low energy. Several points are important, though.

1. Because of the negative sample bias, primary electrons near 0 eV at the sample are
assured to be leaving the gun (20 eV departure) and arriving at (20 eV -20 V) eV.

2. Because of the algorithm used to calculate the SEY from the primary and sample
currents at 0 eV incident energy, a divide by 0 blowup occurs. To avoid this problem,
the ﬁrst point at 0 eV is forced to value one. The ﬁrst ”true” data point is at 2 eV
for 300 eV range and 10 eV for 3000 eV range.

3. The uncertainty in the sample electrometer current reading is set by the input
20 pA.

operational ampliﬁer bias leakage,

±

4. Using sample current to determine SEY excludes the elastically reﬂected electrons
from the calculation (they would need to be collected by an external to the sample
grid structure). That serves to increase the SEY (less sample current) by 1-3%.
This is fortuitously balanced by the fact that the -20 V bias does not repel 100% of
nearby surface secondaries.

The consequence of all of these points is that the SEY measurements are just that,
”secondary”. Which means that it does not include the elastics. The SEY measurements
are however, accurate.
It is important to not look at the SEY at low primary energy
and try to conclude something about elastic reﬂectivity. Data below 20 eV comes from
a band structure and are a combination of diﬀraction from the crystalline structure and
energy absorption by the material [12]. Surface eﬀects such as roughness can also change
the SEY.

4 Results and Comments

Figure 11: TiN thickness mea-
sured by x-ray ﬂuorescence of the
Ti K-line of four BNL samples

The TiN coating, made at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), was deposited onto
aluminium alloy substrates, following the same recipe described in [9]. For the Spallation
Neutron Source (SNS) project, the coating was done on S/S. According to BNL, the
expected ﬁlm thickness is around 1000 ˚A. We measured the actual sample thicknesses
using XRF, Fig.11.

The principle of XRF is to collect secondary x-rays generated and exiting the sample
when bombarded by primary incident x-rays. The secondary ﬂuorescence yield is highest
somewhat above the K-absorption edge of Ti, so primary x-rays of 7 keV are used for
the excitation of the Ti-Kα line (4.51 keV). A TiN ﬁlm of similar known thickness (by
Rutherford backscatter spectrometry, performed at an outside lab) is used to calibrate
the technique.
The height of the measured Ti-Kα line, using a Si Li-drifted x-ray detector, is linearly
proportional to the number of Ti atoms in the ﬁlm. Results are shown for a few samples
in Fig.11.

SEY measurements results of six diﬀerent ”as received” TiN samples are displayed in
Fig.12 and Fig.13. The electron beam impinging onto the surface is of the order of 2 nA
over an area of less than a mm2. Typically the beam size is between 0.2 mm to 0.4 mm
in diameter. The low current is necessary in order to avoid surface conditioning during
SEY measurement. The size of the beam can be checked by using a ﬂuorescent screen, or
is inferred from secondary electron microscopical imaging (available on the measurement
system and used to precisely choose the point of SEY measurement).

The SEY of the samples varies from 1.5 to 2.5, with the thickest ﬁlm samples displaying
the lower SEY. However, we have no data concerning the roughness, and the roughness
can be a factor which can change the SEY. The commonly accepted hypothesis is that,
for a given chemical surface, the rougher surface has a lower SEY than a smoother one
[4]. The irregularity in the SEY, at near maximum, for sample TiN#4 and TiN#6 can
be due to a non uniform spot emitting secondaries with two diﬀerent yields. The result

could be the superposition of the two SEY curves. As the gun appears very reliable in
repetitive measurements we do not believe the irregularity is an artifact due to the system.
Other measurements of the SEY for unbaked S/S (δ
2 at 250 eV) or an as received
NEG, Fig.14, do not shows these shoulders. XPS survey of TiN#6 shows presence of
magnesium. Its expected inﬂuence on the SEY is not known.

Finally, an alternative coating to TiN is sputter-deposited TiZrV getter (

2µm thick-
ness). This NEG, when activated, shows a drastic reduction of its SEY, Fig.14 and Fig.15.
These results conﬁrm what has been investigated elsewhere [8]. It is also interesting to
follow the behaviour of the SEY curves when the sample is just exposed to only a residual
3.10−10 Torr for an extended period of time. The SEY of the TiZrV
gas background of
goes up with time when exposed to even such good vacuum.
Interestingly enough, it
is claimed in [8] that the inﬂuence in the SEY of the NEG after exposure to 30 000 L
(1L= 10−6 Torr.s) of CO or CO2 is rather small. δmax will increase from 1.1 (CERN fully
activated NEG) to 1.35 (max) while in UHV [8]. ∆(SEY) is 0.25 using CERN results and
is 0.3 for ours, 1.3

If we consider, at ﬁrst, that our SEY measurement is errorless, one can argue that
our activation was not complete. Hence, some initial air formed oxide is still present and
the surface chemistry is not identical to a fully activated NEG, hence explaining our δ
after activation of 1.3. In this case the SEY should still not increase above 1.35 [8] as the
getter does not have many pumping sites left. However, this hypothesis might have to be
discarded as the minimal temperature we are certain to have achieved is at least 201◦C.
As a result of a power outage of an hour, during the eleven days of monitoring, an ion
gauge, a residual gas analyser and the ion pump were turned oﬀ. At the switch on
of the gauges, hot ﬁlaments release gases in the system before being pumped away by
the ion pump. The recorded pressure in the system was at the switch on of the gauges
6.10−10 Torr. This kind of incident also can happen in an accelerator, and it is interesting
∼
to see that this eﬀect leads to the recontamination of the getter. Between the days eleven
and days twenty, the system was used to XPS other samples. Due to the transfer of
samples from the load lock chamber to the measurement chamber, the pressure rose up

XPS analysis was carried out to observe the evolution of the carbon chemistry during
this 20 days and compared to the XPS spectrum taken after the end of the activation.
The XPS spectrum shows a slight rise of the oxygen peak and a double valency carbon
1s peak. The elemental carbon peak has an energy of
285 eV and the oxidized carbon
∼
peak has an energy of
288 eV. The oxidized carbon peak after the end of the activation
at 288 eV was barely present, Fig.16, blue plot. The NEG is at 180◦C. This result is very
similar to that of a cleanly-scraped carbon surface, measured at room temperature. After
sixteen hours of pumping, green plot, the oxidized state of the carbon shows up. This
state becomes dominant after eleven days of pumping and keep increasing after 20 days,
gray curve. In the last cases the NEG was at room temperature. The plots presented in
Fig.16 are a ﬁt of the actual data. This increase of the C-O peak implies that the SEY
should also increase, as is usually the case for oxidized metal surfaces.

The roughness (R) of the TiZrV ﬁlm is unknown. This roughness aﬀects not only the

Figure 16: XPS C peak of a TiZrV ﬁlm after the end of activation

NEG, the XPS of 11 days and 20 days should be similar, as the NEG is basically saturated.
This increase of the C-O peak, Fig.16, suggests that the surface still had some remaining
pumping speed after eleven days of vacuum exposure. Hence having a roughness R > 1.
NEG provides a nice solution for a distributed pumping inside a vacuum chamber, when
activated. Our small sample, a few cm2, being at 300 K pumped all of the residual gas in
the chamber except CH4. In a few meters long NEG coated chamber the contamination
comes from outgassing surfaces outside this chamber, since the NEG ﬁlm is a diﬀusion
barrier for outgassing molecules of the substrate. Depending of the average vacuum in
the machine and the length of the NEG chambers, the recontamination of the surface
might take longer than for our sample. Hence, the SEY might not increase as rapidly as
measured here, Fig.14 and Fig.15.

Also, it has to be taken into account that the pumping lifetime of thin ﬁlm NEG
depends on its thickness and the number of activation cycles [11]. The inﬂuence of the
thickness of the ﬁlm should also be taken into account, when calculating the impedance
for the image current on the vacuum chamber wall, due to a passing particle beam. The
requirement on the conductivity and the good mechanical performance after an in-situ
bake of the substrate is of importance.
For the main damping rings, current design will use aluminium-alloy chamber. Aluminium
looses mechanical strength when heated above 150◦C. An adequate substrate for TiN or
TiZrV which fulﬁlls the mechanical requirements is the alloy, Al 6061, or Al 6060 which is
easier to extrude. Their conductivity is
1.4 times lower than for pure aluminium. SEY
measurements on a TiN ﬁlm deposited on Al 6061 has already been carried out at SLAC
[13].

5 Conclusion

We have presented a report on the status of the SEY experiment carried out at SLAC.
Description of our experimental system has been presented.

First results on as-received TiN sample and on an as-received TiZrV getter have been

by its pumping action were investigated. The maximum SEY δ increased from
1.3
1.5 after eleven days and to
1.6 after twenty-two days of exposure to a vacuum
to
3.10−10 Torr. Our SEY results seem to disagree with CERN [8]. First of all, our
of
starting δmax is 1.3 compare to 1.1 [8]. Second, we have an increase in δmax above the
CERN-predicted 1.35 [8]. This matter should be investigated further as the implication
to electron cloud development is of importance for a positively charged beam running in
an accelerator.

Values of δ for energies below 20 eV should be used carefully if plugged into simulation.
It is planned to investigate further this part of the SEY curve, as has been done at CERN
[14].

Additionally, we will study the inﬂuence of various treatments, such as the in-situ
bakeout of TiN, electron conditioning applied for the NLC case, and also the inﬂuence of
ion conditioning. By conditioning we mean bombarding the surface with a given spectrum
in energy of electrons and ions. Diﬀerent species of ions can also be investigated.
It has to be stressed that conditioning (dose eﬀect) is a very eﬃcient way of lowering the
SEY of any technical surfaces to almost the same value (δ = 1.2); and thus independently
of the initial δ [4]. However, such measurements are time consuming and might not be
relevant to the operation of an accelerator, depending on the ﬂux of electrons associated
with post-commissioning production operation.

6 Acknowledgments

We would like to thank P. He and H.C. Hseuh at BNL for providing the TiN samples
and the EST group from C. Benvenuti at CERN for the TiZrV sample. We also thank
A. Wolski at LBNL for shepherding the production of sample plates, and in the near
future, for thin ﬁlm samples coming from LBNL. Most valuable was the work of G.
Collet and E. Garwin, SLAC, for converting and baking the XPS system for use on SEY
measurements.

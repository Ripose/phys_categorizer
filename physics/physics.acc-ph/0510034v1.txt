Abstract. A large admittance sector cyclotron ﬁlled with LiH wedges surrounded by helium or
hydrogen gas is explored. Muons are cooled as they spiral adiabatically into a central swarm.
As momentum approaches zero, the momentum spread also approaches zero. Long bunch trains
coalesce. Energy loss is used to inject the muons into the outer rim of the cyclotron. The density of
material in the cyclotron decreases adiabatically with radius. The sector cyclotron magnetic ﬁelds
are transformed into an azimuthally symmetric magnetic bottle in the center. Helium gas is used to
inhibit muonium formation by positive muons. Deuterium gas is used to allow captured negative
muons to escape via the muon catalyzed fusion process. The presence of ionized gas in the center
may automatically neutralize space charge. When a bunch train has coalesced into a central swarm,
it is ejected axially with an electric kicker pulse.

INTRODUCTION

Cooling an ensemble of muons must be completed more rapidly than their 2.2 m s life-
time. Ionization cooling can help [1]. Random muon motion is removed by passage
through a low Z material, such as hydrogen, and coherent motion is added with RF ac-
celeration. Designs for 6D muon cooling using linear helical channels [2] at 100 MeV
kinetic energies and using frictional cooling [3,4] at keV energies are under investiga-
tion. Muon cooling rings have been simulated at various levels [5]. In a ring, the same
magnets and RF cavities may be reused each time a muon orbits. Transverse cooling can
naturally be exchanged for longitudinal cooling by allowing higher momentum muons
to pass through more material. Thus rings cool in all six dimensions.

Small emittance bunches of cold muons are useful to reduce the aperture of the
acceleration system for a neutrino factory [6,7] and are required to provide adequate
luminosity for a muon collider [8]. At a neutrino factory, accelerated muons are stored
in a racetrack to produce neutrino beams (m − →
m ).
Neutrino oscillations have been observed [9] and need more study. Further exploration
at a neutrino factory could reveal CP violation in the lepton sector [10], and will be
particularly useful if the n e to n
t coupling, q 13, is small [7,11]. A muon collider can do
s-channel scans to split the H0 / A0 Higgs doublet [12]. Above the ILC’s 800 GeV there
are a large array of supersymmetric particles that might be produced [13] and, if large
extra dimensions exist, so could mini black holes [14]. Note that the energy resolution
of a 4 TeV muon collider is not smeared by beamstrahlung like CLIC.

OPERATION OF AN AZIMUTHALLY SYMMETRIC INVERSE
CYCLOTRON AT LEAR (P-BAR) AND PSI (MU-)

An inverse cyclotron has been used to slow LEAR anti-protons at CERN [15,16]. An
annular quasipotential well, U (r, z), is formed which ferries anti-protons towards the
center of an azimuthally symmetric cyclotron. The radius of the annulus decreases with
the decreasing angular momentum of the p.

U (r, z) = V (r, z)

(1/(2h r 2)) (Lg/M + h rAq )2,
where h = e/M and Lg = Lz
is a generalized angular momentum. The radial
well deepens with decreasing radius and the vertical well grows shallower (see Fig. 2 of
Ref. 15). Particles must adiabatically spiral to the center. If dE/dx is too large, particles
will not stay in the magnetic wells. The ﬁnal p swarm has a radius of 1.5 cm, a height of
4 cm, and a kinetic energy of 2 keV. A long bunch train is coalesced into a single swarm,
which is roughly the same diameter as the incoming beam. The spiral time is 20 m s with
0.3 mbar hydrogen and about 1 m s with 10 mbar hydrogen. Given the dependence of the
cyclotron frequency on mass, f = w /2p = qB/2p m, the spiral time for a muon is nine
time less than for a p. The gas pressure in the center must be low, both to allow a particle
to spiral all the way in before stopping, and to allow reasonable kicker voltages for axial
extraction. An 80 ns electric kicker pulse rising to 500 V/cm in 20 ns is employed. The
p’s move 32 cm in 500 ns. Given that F = ma, muons will go nine times farther.

The cyclotron has now been moved from LEAR to PSI where it is used to slow nega-
tive muons to a few keV [17]. Three centimeter diameter beams with 30 000 m −/s below
50 keV and 0.8 cm diameter beams with 1000 m −/s in the 3 to 6 keV kinetic energy range
are output for use. A static electric ﬁeld continuously ejects the muons. The energy ab-
sorber and the negatively charged electrode consist of a single 30 m g/cm2 Formvar foil
(polyvinyl formal) with 3 nm of nickel produced by 30 minutes of sputtering.

SKETCH OF A SECTOR INVERSE CYCLOTRON WITH LARGE
ADMITTANCE FOR MUONS

A scaling sector cyclotron would allow greater admittance [18] than the azimuthally
symmetric cyclotron now running at PSI. For a given R B
d ℓ, the ratio of the ﬁelds in the
·
hills and valleys can be adjusted to maximize acceptance. Only radial and neither spiral
nor FFAG [19] sectors have been explored so far. The sector cyclotron may be able
to function as a damped harmonic oscillator to lower the amplitude of horizontal and
vertical betatron motion as a bunch train of muons spirals into a single central swarm.

With 1012 muons in a swarm, space charge is a concern. Table 1 and Eqn. 2 show the
effect of space charge. Fortunately, the muons are swarming in an ionized gas which may
be able to automatically neuralize the space charge [20]. Electrons experience 200 times

FIGURE 1.
(a) ICOOL [21] simulation of single turn, energy loss injection. Three identical 172 MeV/c
muons are injected into a 1.8 Tesla cyclotron with four sectors and soft edged magnetic ﬁelds. The inward
spirals differ because of multiple scattering and straggling. The energy loss is caused by radial LiH wedges
surrounded by hydrogen gas. The amount of matter encountered in a given orbit decreases adiabatically
with radius to allow stable orbits. The upper left trace shows that vertical motion is completely contained
within
5 cm along the 70 m spiral. The fractional energy loss required in the ﬁrst turn for injection
increases with the width of the muon beam and decreases as the cyclotron’s magnetic ﬁeld is lowered.
The injection scaling relation is given by D p = .3 B D r. Units are GeV/c, Tesla, and meters, respectively.

The default value of “CUTMUO” was decreased from 10 MeV to 10 eV to propagate slow muons. The
energy turnover at 8 keV corresponds to a momentum of 1.3 MeV/c. p = √2mE = √2

the acceleration of muons in an electric ﬁeld. Movement of 1012 electrons in 100 ns
requires 1.6 amps of current. A metallic grid might also be used for neutralization.

Muons must spiral in fast enough to minimize decay loss, but must not stop before
reaching the central swarm. So the density of the absorber must decrease smoothly
with radius. Radial LiH wedges immersed in a gas or high to low pressure gases

TABLE 2. Emittance reduction goals for an inverse cyclotron. Emittance goes
as (D px D x) (D py D y) (D pz D z). A muon collider needs a factor of 106 in cooling.
The input assumes a factor of 10 in transverse cooling [7]. The output for D p is
from a study of what might be achieved with frictional muon cooling [3].

separated by beam pipes might meet this criteria. The sector cyclotron geometry must
transform into an azimuthally symmetric magnetic bottle as the muons approach the
central swarm. Otherwise, as shown by GEANT3, muons will escape though the valleys.
In the transition region the ﬁeld might resemble a hexapole or octupole ﬁeld as used in an
1012 172 MeV/c muons
Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Source (ECRIS) [22]. If 2
(KE = 96 MeV) arrive at 30 Hz, they will deposit 920 watts of beam power.

Atoms can capture muons. Helium may be used to inhibit muonium (m +e−) formation
[3]. A possibility for negative muons is to use deuterium gas. Muons will catalyze fusion
1012
and be freed. The sticking factor is 10%. The reaction appears in Eqn. 3 [23]. 2
fusions repeated at 30 Hz only generate 35 watts. The momentum of the freed muon
ranges from 0 to 29 MeV/c. A negatively charged absorber foil might also prevent m −
sticking and is used at PSI. The foil would have to dissipate roughly 100 watts.

Busch’s theorem (Eqn. 4) [24] has the effect of increasing the emittance as muons
leave a magnetic ﬁeld. A half Tesla ﬁeld and a 50 mm radius give a 4 MeV/c azimuthal
kick. One might be able to use radial iron ﬁns in the exit port to alleviate this effect or
reverse and increase the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld to capture the unwanted angular
momentum in an absorber after extraction. Using low ﬁelds with tall cylindrical swarms
that have small diameters works for sure. An RF quadrupole is perhaps a natural choice
for acceleration that would immediately follow the extraction electric kicker.

In summary, progress on a large admittance sector cyclotron is underway, including
energy loss injection (see Fig. 1a), 6D muon cooling (see Table 2), and an axial electric
kicker for extraction. Many thanks to Juan Gallardo and Franz Kottmann for useful sug-

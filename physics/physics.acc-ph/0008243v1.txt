Abstract

A highly accurate self-consistent particle code to simulate the beam-beam col-
lision in e+e− storage rings has been developed. It adopts a method of solving
the Poisson equation with an open boundary. The method consists of two steps:
assigning the potential on a ﬁnite boundary using the Green’s function, and then
solving the potential inside the boundary with a fast Poisson solver. Since the
solution of the Poisson’s equation is unique, our solution is exactly the same as
the one obtained by simply using the Green’s function. The method allows us to
select much smaller region of mesh and therefore increase the resolution of the
solver. The better resolution makes more accurate the calculation of the dynam-
ics in the core of the beams. The luminosity simulated with this method agrees
quantitatively with the measurement for the PEP-II B-factory ring in the linear
and nonlinear beam current regimes, demonstrating its predictive capability in
detail.

1 Introduction

The beam-beam interaction is one of the most important limiting factors determining the
luminosity of storage colliders. It has been studied extensively by theoretical analysis [1],
experimental measurements [2], and computer simulations [3]. Historically, due to the com-
plexity of the interaction, many approximations, such as strong-weak [4] or soft-Gaussian [5],
have been introduced in order to simulate the interaction in a reasonable computing time.
The self-consistent simulation of the beam-beam interaction by solving the Poisson equation
with a boundary condition has been proposed ﬁrst to investigate the round beams [6] and
then the ﬂat beams [7]. To enhance the accuracy and to reduce the computational over-
head, an algorithm (and a code) of the so-called δf method that can handle strong-strong
interactions has been introduced [8]. Another self-consistent approach to the beam-beam
interaction is to use the Green’s function directly [9] or indirectly [10].

In the present paper we will develop a method that takes advantage from both self-
consistent approaches: a smaller region of mesh from the method of using the Green’s func-
tion and a faster solver for the interior. In order to develop a highly accurate predictive code
at the luminosity saturation region, it is necessary to have a fully self-consistent treatment of
ﬁeld-particle interaction at collision. Since we are interested in simulating the Asymmetric
e+e− Storage Collider PEP-II [11], which needs to maximize the luminosity and thus the
beam current, it is even more crucial that the beam-beam interaction in the large current
regime be treated accurately.

In a self-consistent simulation of the beam-beam interaction in storage rings, the beam
distributions have to be evolved dynamically during collision with the opposing beam to-
gether with the propagation in the rings. During collision, the beam distributions are used
at each time sequence to compute the force that acts on the opposing beam.

Since positrons and electrons are ultra-relativistic particles in high energy storage rings,
the beam-beam force is transverse and acts only on the opposing beam. Hence, given a
beam distribution, we can divide the distribution longitudinally into several slices and then
solve for the two-dimensional force for each slice. Self-consistency is achieved by introducing
many-body particles in the ﬁeld that in turn constitute charge-current, the strategy of the
particle-in-cell (PIC) procedure (for example, Ref. [12]). In this paper, for simplicity, we use
only a single longitudinal slice for a bunch, ignoring any beam-beam eﬀects encompassing
over the length of the bunch.

2 Method

In modern colliders, beams are focused strongly at the interaction point to achieve high
luminosity. As a result the transverse dimension of the beam is much smaller than the
dimension of the beam pipe at the collision point. Therefore, the open boundary condition
is a good approximation for calculating the transverse beam-beam force.

2.1 Green’s Function

Given a charge density ρc(x, y), which is normalized to the total charge

where N is the total number of particles, the electric potential φ(x, y) satisﬁes the Poisson
equation

Z dxdyρc(x, y) = Ne,

(2.1)

  ∂2
∂x2 +

∂2

∂y2!φ(x, y) = −2πρc(x, y)

(2.2)

with x and y being the transverse coordinates. The solution of the Poisson equation can be
expressed as

φ(x, y) = Z dx′dy′G(x − x′, y − y′)ρc(x′, y′),

where G is the Green’s function which satisﬁes the equation

  ∂2
∂x2 +

∂2

∂y2!G(x − x′, y − y′) = −2πδ(x − x′)δ(y − y′).

(2.3)

(2.4)

In the case of open boundary condition, namely the boundary is far away so that its con-
tribution to the potential can be ignored, one has the well-known explicit solution for the
Green’s function:

G(x − x′, y − y′) = −

1
2

lnh(x − x′)2 + (y − y′)2i.

(2.5)

This explicit solution can be used directly to compute the potential. The main problem of
this approach is that it is slow to calculate the logarithm and the number of computations
is proportional to the square of the number of macro particles N 2
p . One can reduce Np by
introducing a two-dimensional mesh to smooth out the charge distribution [9]. Or to further
improve the computing speed, one can map the solution onto the space of spectrum by the
Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) and then calculate the potential [10].

2.2 Reduce the Region of Mesh

Another alternative approach is to solve the Poisson equation with a boundary condition
[7], because the region (20 µm × 450 µm for PEP-II) occupied by the beam is much smaller
than the boundary deﬁned by the beam pipe (2 cm radius) at the collision point. In order
to achieve required resolution, a few mesh points per σ of the beam are needed, otherwise
the size of mesh is too large for numerical computation.

However, it is unnecessary to cover the entire area with mesh inside the beam pipe since
the area is mostly empty. We choose a smaller and ﬁnite area of the mesh, which is large
enough to cover the whole beam, and by carefully selecting the potential on the boundary,
we can obtain the accurate solution inside the boundary.

3

We denote by φ1 the solution (2.3) of the Poisson equation. Let φ2 be the solution
obtained by solving the Poisson equation in a two-dimensional area S with the potential
prescribed on a closed one-dimensional L bounding the area S

φ2(x, y) = ZS

dx′dy′G(x − x′, y − y′)ρc(x′, y′),

(2.6)

where (x, y) ∈ L. By deﬁnition, we have φ1 = φ2 on the boundary L. Let U = φ1 − φ2 and
use the ﬁrst identity of Green’s theorem [13] in two dimensions

ZS hU∇2U + (∇U)2idxdy = IL

U

∂U
∂n

dl,

(2.7)

where dl is a line element of L with a unit outward normal n. Since U = 0 on L and ∇2U = 0
inside L, we have

ZS

(∇U)2dxdy = 0,

(2.8)

implying that U is a constant inside L. We can set U = 0, which is consistent with the value
on the boundary. Hence φ1 = φ2. The two solutions are identical.

3 Field Solver

We adopt the PIC technique to calculate the ﬁelds induced by the charge (and current)
of the beams self-consistently. The charge distribution of a beam is represented by macro
particles. These macro particles are treated as single electron or positron dynamically. In
order to compute the ﬁeld acting on the particles of the opposing beam, we ﬁrst deposit
their charges onto the gird points of a two-dimensional rectangular mesh. We denote by Hx
the horizontal distance between two adjacent grid points and by Hy the distance in vertical
direction.

3.1 Charge Assignment

We choose the method of the triangular-shaped cloud [15] as our scheme for the charge
assignment onto the grid. On a two-dimensional grid, associated with each macro particle,
nine nearest points are assigned with non-vanishing weights as illustrated in Fig. 1. We use
“0” to denote the ﬁrst, “+” as the second, and “-” as the third nearest lines.

The weights are quadratic polynomials of the fractional distance, rx = δx/Hx, to the

nearest line

The coeﬃcients are chosen such that the transition at the middle of the grid is continuous
and smooth, and w0
x = 1 which is required by the conservation of charge. In order
to retain these properties, the weights of the two-dimensional grid are simply a product of
two one-dimensional weights. For example, w00 = w0

3.2 Poisson Solver

It is crucial to solve the Poisson equation fast enough (within a second on a computer
workstation) for the beam-beam simulation, because the radiation damping time is about
5000 turns and several damping times are needed to reach an equilibrium distribution. For
the reason of the computing speed, we follow Krishnagopal [7] and choose the method of
cyclic reduction and FFT [14]. A ﬁve-point diﬀerence scheme is used to approximate the
two-dimensional Laplacian operator

y . It is worthwhile to mention that, if we
use the same number of mesh points per σ in both transverse directions in the case of beam
aspect ratio 30:1, the truncation errors in the horizontal plane are dominant. To minimize

x and H 2

the errors in our simulation, we select three times more mesh points per σ in horizontal
direction compared to the vertical one.

[(φi+1,j+1 − φi+1,j−1) + 4(φi,j+1 − φi,j−1) + (φi−1,j+1 − φi−1,j−1)]. (3.4)

The ﬁeld oﬀ the grid is computed with the same smoothing scheme used in the charge assign-
ment to ensure the conservation of the momentum. The ﬁelds Ex and Ey are interpolated
between the grid points. They are calculated by using the weighted summation of the ﬁelds
at the nine nearest points with exactly the same weights used as the charge is assigned.

The motion of a particle is described by its canonical coordinates

When synchrotron radiation is turned oﬀ, a matrix is used to describe the linear motion in
the lattice

when the linear coupling is ignored

Here Mx, and My are 2 × 2 symplectic matrices. The matrix Mx is expressed with the
Courant-Snyder parameters βx, αx, and γx at the collision point

Mx =   cos(2πνx) + αx sin(2πνx) βx sin(2πνx)

cos(2πνx) − αx sin(2πνx) ! ,

(4.4)

where νx is the horizontal tune. A similar expression is applied in the vertical plane.

4.2 Damping and Synchrotron Radiation

Following Hirata [16], we apply the radiation damping and quantum excitation in the nor-
malized coordinates, since it is easily generalized to include the linear coupling. The motion
of a particle in the normalized coordinate is described by a rotation matrix

(4.7)

(4.8)

where η¯x and η ¯px are Gaussian random variables normalized to unity, τx is the damping
time in unit of number of turns and ǫx is the equilibrium emittance. In the vertical plane, a
similar map is applied.

4.3 Beam-Beam Kick

Assuming particles are ultra-relativistic and the collision is head-on, the kick on a particle
by the opposing beam is given by the Lorenz force

δPx = −
δPy = −

(4.9)

(4.10)

where Ex and Ey are the horizontal and vertical components of the electric ﬁeld evaluated
at the position of the particle. They are computed with the Poisson solver as outlined in
the previous section each time two slices of the beam pass each other. And the half of the
transverse force is the magnetic force due the beam moving at the speed of light. The energy
of the particle, E0 = cp0, appearing in the denominator of the above expressions comes from
the normalization of the canonical momenta Px and Py and the use of the s-coordinate,
s = ct, as the “time” variable.

Figure 2: The beam-beam kick by a ﬂat Gaussian beam with aspect ratio 30:1 near X axis and
Y axis. The dash-dotted curve is the case when φ = 0 is assigned as the boundary condition.
The long-dashed curve is the kick when inhomogeneous boundary condition is used. The
short-dashed curve is the kick produced by the Erskine-Bassetti formula [17].

A typical beam-beam kick experienced by a particle near the axis is shown in Fig. 2
with the PEP-II parameters, which are tabulated in the next section. As expected based on
the derivation in section 2.2, the kick resulted from solving the Poisson equation with the
inhomogeneous boundary condition agrees well with the analytic solution. In addition, the
agreement demonstrates that the scheme of the charge deposition works well, the mesh is
dense enough and the number of macro particles is large enough.

The number of macro particles used to represent the distribution of the beam is 10240.
The area of the mesh is 8σx×24σy and there are 15 grid points per σx and 5 per σy. There
are about 15 macro particles per cell within 3σ of the beam. These parameters are chosen
to minimize truncation errors and maximize resolution. The 256×256 mesh is also the
maximum allowed by a computer workstation to complete a typical job within a reasonable
time.

The discrepancy between the solution with the homogeneous boundary condition, φ = 0,
and the analytic one worsen as the beam aspect ratio becomes larger because the actual
change of the potential on the horizontal boundaries becomes larger.

5 Simulation of PEP-II: Validation

An object-oriented C++ class library has been written to simulate the beam-beam interac-
tion using the method outlined in the previous sections. In the library, the beam and the
Poisson solver are all independent objects that can be constructed by the user. For example,
there is no limitation on how many beam objects are allowed in the simulation and the beams
can have diﬀerent parameters as an instance of the beam class. These features provide us
with great ﬂexibility to study various phenomena of the beam-beam interaction.

We will carry out the simulation of beam-beam interaction with the current operating
parameters of the PEP-II so that the results of the simulation can be compared with the
known experimental observations. As a goal of this study, after a proper benchmarking of the
code against the experiment, we shall be able to make predictions on parameter dependence
and show how to improve the luminosity performance of the collider.

Table 5.1: Parameters for the beam-beam simulation

The parameters used in the simulation are tabulated in Tab. 5.1. The vertical β ∗

y is
lowered to 1.25cm [18] from the design value 1.5cm [11]. The horizontal emittance 24nm-rad
in the Low Energy Ring (LER) is half of the design value 48nm-rad because the wiggler is
turned oﬀ to increase the luminosity. The damping time, 9740 turns, in the LER is a factor
of two larger than the one in the High Energy Ring (HER) because of the change of the
wigglers made during the construction of the machine. The degradation of luminosity from
the increase of the damping time was found then to be about 10% based on the beam-beam
simulation. The tunes are split and are determined experimentally to optimize the peak
luminosity.

5.2 Procedure of simulation

The distribution of the beam is represented as a collection of macro particles that are dy-
namically tracked. The procedure to obtain equilibrium distributions of the two colliding
beams is as follows

We vary the beam intensity with a ﬁxed beam current ratio: I+:I− = 2:1, which is close
to the ratio for the PEP-II operation. At each beam current, we compute the equilibrium
distributions.

quantities corresponding to the positron and “-” quantities corresponding to the electron.

The results of the simulation are shown in Fig. 3. The beam-beam tune shifts for the
electron beam are low because of the large beam-beam blowup of the positron beam. At this
operating point, the positron is the weaker beam. When I+ = 1200mA and I− = 600mA,
which is the near the maximum allowed currents when the beams are in collision, the positron
beam sizes are σ+

Figure 4: Luminosity as a function of the beam current. The labels are the number of the
colliding bunches.

Figure 4 shows the luminosity of the beams with 415 colliding bunches, which are spaced
with every 8 RF buckets and 10% of the gap. The luminosity is beam-beam limited. It also
shows that the optimum number of bunches is between 544 and 665 and the luminosity
is about 2.3×1033cm−2s−1 given I+ = 1200mA. These results quantitatively agree with
the experimental observations in the routine operation of the PEP-II. For example, the
peak luminosity of the PEP-II is 1.95×1033cm−2s−1 with I+ = 1170mA, I− = 700mA,
and nb = 665 during the period of June, 2000. The fact that the luminosity value in the
simulation is higher than the observation could be explained by the hour-glass eﬀect which
is ignored in the simulation.

12

For a ﬁxed number of bunches, say 554, the simulation shows a maximum luminosity,
which is also seen daily in the control room of the PEP-II. From the simulation, we see that
the reason for the peaked luminosity is the rapid growth of σ+
y once the peak current is
passed.

In addition, the simulation predicts that we can reach the design luminosity 3×1033cm−2s−1
by running 829 bunches at the beam current of I+ = 1600mA and I− = 800mA. This predic-
tion has not been realized yet at this time. Currently, the total positron current is probably
limited below 1200mA by the electron-cloud instability [19]. Once this limitation is removed,
we expect to reach the design luminosity with 829 bunches.

There is no particle loss outside the area (8σx×24σy) covered by the mesh in the ﬁrst 15

data points. Beyond the 15th points, particle loss is almost about 1%.

5.5 Damping Time

Historically, the damping time is typically not considered to be an important parameter for
the beam-beam eﬀects. So we make an attempt to reduce the damping time artiﬁcially for
the LER to speed up the computation. The result is shown in Fig. 5

The only diﬀerence of the parameters used in two simulations is the damping time in the
LER, which is indicated as the labels in the ﬁgure. Indeed, at the low current, the diﬀerence
of the luminosity is rather small, which is consistent with the simulation performed when the
change of the wiggler was made. But the diﬀerence grows larger, as the current increases.
At the peak luminosity for the PEP-II operation, I+ = 1200mA, the diﬀerence is about 40%,
which is signiﬁcant.

This result shows for the ﬁrst time that the damping time is a rather important parameter
for the computation of the peak luminosity at high beam currents. Secondly, it points a way
to improve the peak luminosity of the PEP-II without the increase of the beam currents,
namely to install another wiggler in the LER to reduce the damping time to the original
design value.

6 Discussion

We have developed a hybrid method of solving the potential with an open boundary by
using Green’s function to ﬁx the potential on a ﬁnite boundary and then to solve the Poisson
equation for the potential inside the boundary. The method is applied to the simulation of
strong-strong interaction of beam-beam eﬀects in PEP-II. The preliminary results of this
simulation show a very good quantitative agreement with the experimental observations.
Given the simplicity of the two-dimensional model used, the achievement is surprising and
remarkable. We have demonstrated that the present code has a highly reliable predictive
capability of realistic beam-beam interaction. To further benchmark the code, we need to
extend the simulation to include the ﬁnite length of the bunch and compare the simulation
results directly to the controlled experiments.

This method is quite general. It can be applied to the problem of space charge in three
dimensions. It can also be used in the beam-beam interaction of a linear collider. Finally,

Abstract

Langevin simulation provides an effective way to study col-
lisional effects in beams by reducing the six-dimensional
Fokker-Planck equation to a group of stochastic ordinary
differential equations. These resulting equations usually
have multiplicative noise since the diffusion coefﬁcients in
these equations are functions of position and time. Con-
ventional algorithms, e.g. Euler and Heun, give only ﬁrst
order convergence of moments in a ﬁnite time interval. In
this paper, a stochastic leap-frog algorithm for the numeri-
cal integration of Langevin stochastic differential equations
with multiplicative noise is proposed and tested. The al-
gorithm has a second-order convergence of moments in a
ﬁnite time interval and requires the sampling of only one
uniformly distributed random variable per time step. As
an example, we apply the new algorithm to the study of a
mechanical oscillator with multiplicative noise.

INTRODUCTION

Multiple Coulomb scattering of charged particles, also
called intra-beam scattering, has important applications in
accelerator operation. It causes a diffusion process of par-
ticles and leads to an increase of beam size and emittance.
This results in a fast decay of the quality of beam and re-
duces the beam lifetime when the size of the beam is large
enough to hit the aperture [1].

An appropriate way to study the multiple Coulomb scat-
tering is to solve the Fokker-Planck equations for the dis-
tribution function in six-dimensional phase space. Never-
theless, the Fokker-Planck equations are very expensive to
solve numerically even for dynamical systems possessing
only a very modest number of degrees of freedom. Trunca-
tion schemes or closures have had some success in extract-
ing the behavior of low-order moments, but the systematics
of these approximations remains to be elucidated. On the
other hand, the Fokker-Planck equations can be solved us-
ing an equivalent Langevin simulation, which reduces the
six-dimensional partial differential equations into a group
of stochastic ordinary differential equations. Compared to
the Fokker-Planck equation, stochastic differential equa-
tions are not difﬁcult to solve, and with the advent of mod-
ern supercomputers, it is possible to run very large num-
bers of realizations in order to compute low-order moments
accurately. In general, the noise in these stochastic ordi-
nary differential equations are multiplicative instead of ad-

ditive since the dynamic friction coefﬁcient and diffusion
coefﬁcient in the Fokker-Planck equations depend on the
spatial position. An effective numerical algorithm to inte-
grate the stochastic differential equation with multiplicative
noise will signiﬁcantly improve the efﬁciency of large scale
Langevin simulation.

The stochastic leap-frog algorithms in the Langevin sim-
ulation are given in Section II. Numerical tests of this algo-
rithms is presented in Section III. A physical application
of the algorithm to the multiplicative-noise mechanic os-
cillator is given in Section IV. The conclusions are drawn
in Section V.

2 STOCHASTIC LEAP-FROG

ALGORITHM

In the Langevin simulation, the stochastic particle equa-
tions of motion that follow from the Fokker-Planck equa-
tion are (Cf. Ref. [2])

r′ = v,
F

v′ =

m − νv + √DΓ(t),

(1)

(2)

where F is the force including both the external force and
the self-generated mean ﬁeld space charge force, m is the
mass of particle, ν is friction coefﬁcient, D is the diffusion
coefﬁcient, and Γ(t) are Gaussian random variables with

hΓi(t)i = 0,

hΓi(t)Γi(t′)i = δ(t − t′).

(3)
(4)

In the case not too far from thermodynamic equilibrium,
the friction coefﬁcient is given as

4√πn(r)Z 4e4 ln (Λ)
3m2(T (r)/m)3/2

ν =

(5)

and the diffusion coefﬁcient D is D = νkT /m [3]. Here,
n(r) is the density of particle, T (r) is the temperature of of
beam, Z is the charge number of particle, e is the charge of
electron, Λ is the Coulomb logarithm, and k is the Boltz-
mann constant. For the above case, noise terms enter only
in the dynamical equations for the particle momenta. In
Eqn. (6) below, the indices are single-particle phase-space
coordinate indices; the convention used here is that the odd
indices correspond to momenta, and the even indices to the
spatial coordinate. In the case of three dimensions, the dy-
namical equations then take the general form:

˙x1 = F1(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6) + σ11(x2, x4, x6)ξ1(t)
˙x2 = F2(x1)

˙x3 = F3(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6) + σ33(x2, x4, x6)ξ3(t)

˙x4 = F4(x3)
˙x5 = F5(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6) + σ55(x2, x4, x6)ξ5(t)
(6)

˙x6 = F6(x5)

In the dynamical equations for the momenta, the ﬁrst term
on the right hand side is a systematic drift term which in-
cludes the effects due to external forces and damping. The
second term is stochastic in nature and describes a noise
force which, in general, is a function of position. The noise
ξ(t) is ﬁrst assumed to be Gaussian and white as deﬁned
by Eqns. (3)-(4). The stochastic leap-frog algorithm for
Eqns. (6) is written as

¯xi(h) = ¯Di(h) + ¯Si(h)

(7)

The deterministic contribution ¯Di(h) can be obtained us-
ing the deterministic leap-frog algorithm. Here, the deter-
ministic contribution ¯Di(h) and the stochastic contribution
¯Si(h) of the above recursion formula for one-step integra-
tion are found to be

¯Di(h) = ¯xi(0) + hFi(¯x∗

where R is a uniformly distributed random number on the
interval (0,1). This trick signiﬁcantly reduces the computa-
tional cost in generating random numbers.

(10)

h( ˜Wi(h))2i = 1,

h( ˜Wi(h))4i = 3

This can not only be achieved by choosing true Gaussian
random numbers, but also by using the sequence of random
numbers following:

where F1(p, x) = −γp − η2x and σ(x) = −αx. The
stochastic leapfrog integrator for this case is given by
Eqns. (8) (white noise) with the substitutions x1 = p,
x2 = x.

As a ﬁrst test, we computed hx2i as a function of time-
step size. To begin, we took the case of zero damping con-
stant (γ = 0), where hx2i can be determined analytically.
The curve in Fig. 1 shows hx2i at t = 6.0 as a function
of time-step size with white Gaussian noise. Here, the pa-
rameters η and α are set to 1.0 and 0.1. The analytically
determined value of hx2i at t = 6.0 is 2.095222. The
quadratic convergence of the stochastic leap-frog algorithm
is clearly seen in the numerical results. We also veriﬁed
that the quadratic convergence is present for nonzero damp-
ing (γ = 0.1). At t = 12.0, and with all other parameters
as above, the convergence of hx2i as a function of time step
is shown by the curve in Fig. 2. As a comparison against
the conventional Heun’s algorithm [5], we computed hx2i
as a function of t using 100, 000 numerical realizations for
a particle starting from (0.0, 1.5) in the (x, p) phase space.
The results along with the analytical solution and a numer-
ical solution using Heun’s algorithm are given in Fig. 3.
Parameters used were h = 0.1, η = 1.0, and α = 0.1. The
advantage in accuracy of the stochastic leap-frog algorithm
over Heun’s algorithm is clearly displayed, both in terms
of error amplitude and lack of a systematic drift.

analytical calculation is due to the truncation in the energy
envelope equation using the hE 2(t)i ≈ 2hE(t)i2 relation
which yields an upper bound on the rate of equilibration of
the average energy [6].

5 CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a stochastic leap-frog algorithm for
Langevin simulation with multiplicative noise.
This
method has the advantages of retaining the symplectic
property in the deterministic limit, ease of implementa-
tion, and second-order convergence of moments for mul-
tiplicative noise. Sampling a uniform distribution instead
of a Gaussian distribution helps to signiﬁcantly reduce the
computational cost. A comparison with the conventional
Heun’s algorithm highlights the gain in accuracy due to the
new method. Finally, we have applied the stochastic leap-
frog algorithm to a nonlinear mechanic-oscillator system to
investigate the the nature of the relaxation process.

4 APPLICATION

In this section, we apply our algorithm to studying the ap-
proach to thermal equilibrium of an oscillator with multi-
plicative noise. The governing equations are:

˙p = −ω2
˙x = p

0x − λx2p −

√2Dxξ2(t)

where the diffusion coefﬁcients D = λkT , λ is the cou-
pling constant, and ω0 is the oscillator angular frequency
without damping.
In Fig. 4, we display the time evolu-
tion of the average energy with multiplicative noise from
the simulations and the approximate analytical calcula-
tions [6]. The analytic approximation resulting from the
application of the energy-envelope method is seen to be in
reasonable agreement with the numerical simulations for
kT = 4.5. The slightly higher equilibrium rate from the

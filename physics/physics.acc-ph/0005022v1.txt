Abstract

In this paper the single and multibunch emittance growths in the main linac of a linear
collider are analytically treated in analogy to the Brownian motion of a molecule, and the
analytical formulae for the emittance growth due to accelerating structure misalignment
errors are obtained by solving Langevin equation. The same set of formulae is derived also
by solving directly Fokker-Planck equation. Comparisons with numerical simulation results
are made and the agreement is quite well.

Introduction

To achieve the required luminosity in a future e+e− linear collider one has to produce two
colliding beams at the interaction point (IP) with extremely small transverse beam dimensions.
According to the linear collider design principles described in ref. 1, the normalized beam
emittance in the vertical plane (the normalized beam emittance in the horizontal plane is larger)
at IP can be expressed as:

γǫy =

n4
γre
374δ∗
Bα4

(1)

where γ is the normalized beam energy, re = 2.82 × 10−15 m is the classical electron radius,
α = 1/137 is the ﬁne structure constant, δ∗
B is the maximum tolerable beamstrahlung en-
ergy spread, and nγ is the mean number of beamstrahlung photons per electron at IP. Taking
B = 0.03 and nγ = 1, one ﬁnds γǫy = 8.86 × 10−8mrad. To produce beams of this small trans-
δ∗
verse emittance damping rings seem to be the only known facilities which have the potential to
do this job. The questions now are that once a beam of this small emittance is produced at the
exit of the damping ring, how about the emittance growth during the long passage through the
accelerating structures and the focusing channels from the damping ring at the beam energy of
few GeV to the IP with the beam energy of a few hundred of GeV, and how to preserve it ?

1

Many works have been dedicated to answer these questions [2][3][4][5]. To start with, in
sections 2, 3, and 4, we consider the short range wakeﬁeld induced single bunch emittance
growth and try to calculate the emittance growth by using two diﬀerent methods, and show
that the two methods give the same results. Since the number of accelerating structures in the
main linac of a linear collider is very large, the transverse random kicks on the particles can be
described statistically. Firstly, we make use of the analogy between the transverse motion of
a particle in a linear accelerator with the Brownian motion of a molecule, which are governed
by Langevin equation. Secondly, we solve directly Fokker-Planck equation. What should be
noted is that both methods are physically consistent. As a natural extension, multibunch case
is treated in section 5. Comparisons with some numerical simulation results are made in section
6.

2 Equation of transverse motion

The diﬀerential equation of the transverse motion of a bunch with zero transverse dimension is
given as:

d2y(s, z)

ds2 +

1

dγ(s, z)

dy(s, z)

γ(s, z)

ds

ds

+ k(s, z)2y(s, z)

where k(s, z) is the instantaneous betatron wave number at position s, z denotes the particle
−∞ ρ(z′)dz′ = 1. Now we rewrite eq. 2 as follows:

ρ(z′)W⊥(s, z′ − z)y(s, z′)dz′

where Γ = γ(0)G
m0c2γ(0) , Ez is the eﬀective accelerating gradient in the linac,
Λ = e2NeW⊥(s,z)y(s,0)
z ρ(z′)W⊥(s, z′ − z)dz′, and y(s, 0) is the deviation of the
bunch head with respect to accelerating structures center. In this section we consider the case
where the injected bunch, quadrupoles and beam position monitors are well aligned, while the
accelerating structures are misaligned. As a consequence, y(s, 0) is a random variable exactly the
same as random accelerating structure misalignment errors with < y(s, 0) >= 0 (< > denotes
the average over s). If we take z as a parameter and regard Γ, k(s, z), and Λ as adiabatical
variables with respect to s, eq. 3 can be regarded as Langevin equation which governs the
Brownian motion of a molecule.

3 Method one: Langevin equation

To make an analogy between the movement of the transverse motion of an electron and that of
a molecule, we deﬁne P = e2NeW⊥(s,z)ls
, and regard y(s, 0)P as the particle’s ”velocity” random
m0c2γ(s,z)
increment (∆ dy
ds ) over the distance ls, where ls is the accelerating structure length. What we
are interested is to assume that the random accelerating structure misalignment error follows
Gaussian distribution:

f (y(s, 0)) =

1

√2πσy

exp −

y(s, 0)2

and the velocity (u) distribution of the molecule follows Maxwellian distribution:

g(u) =r m

2πkT

exp −

mu2

2kT !

(4)

(5)

where m is the molecule’s mass, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature.
The fact that the molecule’s velocity follows Maxwellian distribution permits us to get the
distribution function for Λls [6]:

φ(Λls) =

The eﬀects of energy dispersion within the bunch can be discussed through γ(s, z), k2(s, z),
and W⊥(z), such as BNS damping [3]. From eqs. 13, 18, and 19 one ﬁnds that there are
three convenient types of variations of k(s, z) with respect to s. If one takes k2(s, z)γ(s, z) =
k2(0, z)γ(0, z), one gets < y2 > independent of s.
If one takes, however, k(s, z)γ(s, z) =
k(0, z)γ(0, z), ǫrms is independent of s, and ﬁnally, if k(s, z) = k(0, z), one has ǫn,rms is in-
dependent of s. One takes usually the ﬁrst scaling law in accordance with BNS damping. To
calculate the emittance growth of the whole bunch one has to make an appropriate average over
the bunch, say Gaussian as assumed above, as follows:

ǫbunch

n,rms = R ∞

−∞ ρ(z′)ǫn,rms(z′)dz′

−∞ ρ(z′)dz′

R ∞

(20)

To make a rough estimation one can replace ρ(z) by a delta function δ(z − zc), and in this case
the bunch emittance can be still expressed by eq. 19 with W⊥(z) replaced by W⊥(zc), where zc
is the center of the bunch.

4 Method two: Fokker-Planck equation

Keeping the physical picture described above in mind, one can start directly with Fokker-Planck
equation which governs the distribution function of the Markov random variable, y′:

D =

ls

(21)

(22)

(23)

where ∆y′ is the increment of y′ over ls, and << >> denotes the average over a large number of a
given type of possible structure misalignment error distributions (in numerical simulations, this
average corresponds to the average over the results obtained from a large number of diﬀerent

4

seeds, for a given type of structure misalignment error distribution function, say, Gaussian
distribution). From eq. 3 one gets the increment of y′ over ls :

In consequence, one obtains:

∆y′ = (1 − exp(−

Γls
2

))y′ + Γls

<< (∆y′) >>≈ (1 − exp(−

Γls
2

))y′

<< (∆y′)2 >>≈ (1 − exp(−

Γls
2

))2y′2+ << (Λls)2 >> exp(−Γls)

where << Γls >>= 0 has been used. Inserting eqs. 25 and 38 into eq. 21, one gets:

ls

∂F (s, y′)

∂s

Multiplying both sides with y′2 and integrating over y′, one has:

ls

d < y′2 >

ds

= −(1 − exp(−Γls)) < y′2 > + << (Λls)2 >> exp(−Γls)

Assuming that Γls << 1, eq. 28 is reduced to:

ls

d < y′2 >

ds

= −Γls < y′2 > + << (Λls)2 >>

Solving eq. 29, one gets:

< y′2 >=

<< Λ2 >> ls

2Γ

where y′

0 is the initial condition. Apparently, when s → ∞, one has:

y =<< y(s, 0)2 >>. Eq. 31 is the same as what we have obtained in eq. 14. In fact, by
where σ2
solving directly Fokker-Planck equation we obtain the same set of asymptotical formulae derived
in section 3.

5 Multibunch emittance growth

Physically, the multibunch emittance growth is quite similar to that of the single bunch case,
and each assumed point like bunch in the train can be regarded as a slice in the previously
described single bunch. Obviously, the slice emittance expressed in eq. 19 should be a good
starting point for us to estimate the emittance growth of the whole bunch train. Before making
use of eq. 19 let’s ﬁrst look at the diﬀerential equation which governs the transverse motions of
the bunch train:

where the subscript n denotes the bunch number, sb is the distance between two adjacent
bunches, Ne is the particle number in each bunch, WT (s) is the long range wakeﬁeld produced
by each point like bunch at distance of s. Clearly, the behaviour of the ith bunch suﬀers from
inﬂuences coming from all the bunches before it, and we will treat one bunch after another in an
iterative way. First of all, we discuss about the long range wakeﬁelds. Due to the decoherence
eﬀect in the long range wakeﬁeld only the ﬁrst dipole mode will be considered. For a constant
impedance structure as shown in Fig. 1, one has:

WT,1(s) =

(33)

where σz is the rms bunch length (σz is used to calculate the transverse wake potential, and
the point charge assumption is still valid), ω1 and Q1 are the angular frequency and the loaded
quality factor of the dipole mode, respectively. The loss factor k1 in eq. 33 can be calculated
analytically as [7]:

To reduce the long range wakeﬁeld one can detune and damp the concerned dipole mode. The
resultant long range wakeﬁeld of the detuned and damped structure (DDS) can be expressed as:

where Nc is the number of the cavities in the structure. When Nc is very large one can use
following formulae to describe ideal uniform and Gaussian detuning structures [8]:

Once the long range wakeﬁeld is known one can use eq. 13 to estimate < y2

i > in an iterative
way, and the emittance of the whole bunch can be calculated accordingly as we will show later.
For example, if a bunch train is injected on axis (yn = 0) into the main linac of a linear collider
with structure rms misalignment σy, at the end of the linac one has:

where k(s) = kn(s) (since the bunch to bunch energy spread has been ignored), and k(s) is the
average over the linac.

It is high time now for us to point out that the analytical expressions for the single and
multibunch emittance growths established above give the statistical results of inﬁnite number of
machines with Gaussian structure misalignment error distribution, which corresponds to using
inﬁnite seeds in numerical simulations.

6 Comparison with numerical simulation results

To start with, we take the single bunch emittance growth in the main linac of SBLC [9] for
example. The short range wakeﬁelds in the accelerating S-band structures are obtained by
using the analytical formulae [7] and shown in Fig. 2. In the main linac the beam is injected at
3 GeV and accelerated to 250 GeV with an accelerating gradient of 17 MV/m. The accelerating
structure length ls =6 m, the average beta function β(s) is about 70 m (k(s, z) = 1
β(s) for
smooth focusing), the bunch population Ne = 1.1 × 1010, the bunch length σz = 300 µm, and
and corresponding dipole mode short range wakeﬁeld W⊥(zc) = 338 V/pC/m2. Inserting these
parameters into eq. 19, one ﬁnds ǫn,rms = 8.66 × σ2
z . If accelerating structure misalignment
error σy = 100 µm, one gets a normalized emittance growth of 8.66×10−8 mrad, i.e., 35%
increase compared with the designed normalized emittance of 2.5 × 10−7 mrad. The analytical
result agrees quite well with that obtained from numerical simulations [9]. Now, we apply the
analytical formulae established for the multibunch emittance growth to SBLC, TESLA and NLC
linear collider projects where enormous numerical simulations have been done. The machine
parameters are given in Tables 1 to 4 which have been used in the analytical calculation in this
paper. Firstly, we look at SBLC.

compared with the design value at the interaction point (ǫdesign,IP
and 388% corresponding to the two cases, respectively as shown in Table 4, which agree well
with the numerical results [9].

To demonstrate the necessity of detuning cavities we show the violent bunch train blow up if
constant impedance structures are used in spite of Q1 being loaded to 2000 as shown in Fig. 6.
Secondly, TESLA (the version appeared in ref. 10) is investigated. From Fig. 7 one agrees that
it is a no detuning case.

From the results shown in Fig. 8 and Table 4 one ﬁnds that taking structure misalignment
error σy = 500 µm and Q1 = 7000 one gets an normalized emittance growth of 24% which is a
very reasonable result compared what has been found numerically in ref. 10. Thirdly, we look
at NLC X-band main linac. To facilitate the exercise we assume the detuning is eﬀectuated as
shown in Fig. 9 (in reality, NLC uses Gaussian detuning). Fig. 10 shows the analytical results
with σy = 15 µm and Q1 = 1000. From Table 4 one ﬁnds a normalized emittance growth of
21%. Then, we examine NLC S-band prelinac. Assuming that the detuning of the dipole mode
is shown in Fig. 11, one gets the multibunch transverse behaviour and the normalized emittance
growth in Fig. 12 and Table 4. Finally, in Figs. 13 and 14 we give more information about the
emittance growth vs Q1 in NLC X-band and S-band linacs.

7 Conclusion

We treat the single and multibunch emittance growths in the main linac of a linear collider
in analogy to the Brownian motion of a molecule, and obtained the analytical expressions for
the emittance growth due to accelerating structure misalignment errors by solving Langevin
equation. As proved in this paper, the same set of formulae can be derived also by solving
directly Fokker-Planck equation. Analytical results have been compared with those coming
from the numerical simulations, such as SBLC and TESLA, and the agreement is quite well.
As interesting applications, we give the analytical results on the estimation of the multibunch
emittance growth in NLC X-band and S-band linacs.

8 Acknowledgement

It is a pleasure to discuss with J. Le Duﬀ on the stochastic motions. I thank F. Richard for
his reminding me the work of J. Perez Y Jorba on inverse multiple Touschek eﬀect in linear
colliders, and T.O. Raubenheimer for the discussion on the NLC parameters and detailed beam
dynamics problems.

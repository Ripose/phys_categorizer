Abstract

Our theoretical comparisons suggest that the ATF measurement
results of April 2000 for energy spread, bunch length, and hori-
zontal emittance vs. current, and a low current emittance ratio
of about 1% are generally consistent with intrabeam scattering
(IBS) theory, though the measured eﬀects appear to be stronger
than theory. In particular, the measured factor of 3 growth in
vertical emittance at 3 mA does not seem to be supported. It
appears that either (1) there is another, unknown force in ad-
dition to IBS causing emittance growth in the ATF; or (2) the
factor of 3 vertical emittance growth is not real, and our other
discrepancies are due to the approximate nature of IBS theory.
Our results suggest, in addition, that, even if IBS theory has
inaccuracies, the eﬀect will be useful as a diagnostic in the ATF.
For example, by measuring the energy spread, one will be able to
obtain the emittances. Before this can be done, however, more
benchmarking measurements will be needed.

Taken in April 2000

Introduction

Between April 13-19, 2000 single bunch energy spread, bunch length, and
horizontal and vertical emittances in the ATF were all measured as a func-
tion of current[1]-[3]. One surprising outcome was that the vertical emittance
appeared to grow by a factor of 3 by a current of 3 mA. The ATF is a proto-
type damping ring for the JLC/NLC linear colliders, and the concern with
this result is that it may portend an as yet not understood and unexpected
growth in such damping rings, which would have negative ramiﬁcations on
collider performance. However, since the x-y coupling in the ATF is very
small (
1%), and since the emittance measurements were performed on
the beam after it had been extracted from the ring, the question was, How
much of this measured y-emittance growth was real and how much was due
to measurement error, such as dispersion in the extraction line or in the wire
monitors used for the measurements.

∼

With the ATF as it is now, running below design energy and with the
wigglers turned oﬀ, the beam properties are strongly aﬀected by intra-beam
scattering (IBS), an eﬀect that couples the three dimensions of the beam
together. In April 2000 all the beam dimensions were measured to varying
degrees of accuracy, and the hope is that the knowledge of IBS theory can
be used to check for consistency in the data. Besides the question of the
vertical emittance growth, we hope that IBS theory can be used in beam
diagnostics in the future. For example, the energy spread measurement
It would be nice if this measurement
is quick, accurate, and easy to do.
could be used to estimate the beam emittance and/or bunch length, beam
properties that are much more diﬃcult to measure directly.

The literature on intrabeam scattering is quite extensive. (For an in-
troduction, see for example the IBS section and its bibliography, written
by A. Piwinski, in the Handbook of Accelerator Physics and Engineering
[4]). The ﬁrst rather thorough treatment of IBS in circular accelerators is

(βxη′

due to Piwinski (P), derived following a two-particle Coulomb scattering
formalism[5]. Another formalism is that of Bjorken-Mtingwa (B-M), ob-
tained following quantum mechanical two particle scattering rules[6]. This
is the formalism that is more often used in modern optics programs that also
calculate IBS, programs such as SAD[7]. The B-M result is considered to be
β′
xηx/2)
more general in that the combination of optics terms βxφx ≡
around the ring do not need to be small compared to ηx, whereas in the P
method it seems they do[8]. (Note that this condition is typically violated
in modern low emittance storage rings.) The B-M formalism, however, does
not include vertical dispersion, whereas the P formalism does. Neither for-
malism includes x-y coupling, though a more generalized formulation, which
includes both linear coupling and can also be applied to low emittance ma-
chines, is given by Piwinski in Ref. [9]. Note that in deriving such for-
mulations many approximations were made, having to do with the cut-oﬀ
distance for scattering (typically taken to be the vertical beam size), curved
trajectories, etc. In addition, it appears that no current IBS formalism prop-
erly accounts for the eﬀects of potential well distortion or of the micro-wave
instability. Finally, T. Raubenheimer has pointed out that IBS does not re-
sult in Gaussian bunch distributions, and that these theories give rms beam
sizes that can greatly overemphasize few particles occupying the tails[10].

Most of the early papers comparing IBS theory and measurement were
for bunched and unbunched hadronic machines, where the eﬀect tends to
be more pronounced than in high energy electron machines. For example,
Conte and Martini, for unbunched protrons in the CERN Antiprotron Ac-
cumulator ring, found good agreement for the longitudinal and horizontal
IBS growth rates, but no agreement for the vertical rate[11]. Evans and
Gareyte, for bunched protrons in the SPS, found good agreement for the
radial emittance growth rate with time, once an additional factor repre-
senting gas scattering was included[12]. As for electron machines, both IBS
and the related Touschek eﬀect have become important eﬀects in modern,
low emittance light sources. C.H. Kim at the ALS found that he can get
agreement with measured horizontal emittance growth with current, but to
do this he needed to include a signiﬁcant additional ﬁtting factor in the
calculations[13]. So it may be too much to expect good agreement between
IBS theory and measurement without the use of such fudge factors. Indeed,
A. Piwinski has said that, given the approximations taken in deriving IBS
theory, one can expect agreement between theory and measurement only on
the order of a factor of 2[8]. Yet even if this became the case, it may still be
possible to benchmark the ATF with accurate emittance and energy spread
measurements, to ﬁnd the fudge factors. Then in the future, one may be able

3

to perform simpler measurements—like the energy spread measurement—to
get an estimate of parameters that are more diﬃcult to obtain directly, such
as bunch length and emittance.

Piwinski’s Solution

We are interested in what happens at low coupling, and we will concentrate
on using the more simpliﬁed version of Piwinski’s solution. We begin by re-
producing the Piwinski solution in its entirety[4]. Note that there is nothing
new in this section, except the way potential well distortion is added to the
calculation.

rection x, and in the vertical direction y to be deﬁned as

The global beam properties that are aﬀected by IBS are the rms (relative)
energy spread σp and the rms bunch length σs, the horizontal emittance

parameter d represents a cut-oﬀ for the IBS force, which Piwinski says should
be taken as the vertical beam size, but he also points out that the results

where subscript 0 represents the beam property due to synchrotron radia-

radiation damping times in the three directions. These are 3 coupled equa-
tions in that all 3 IBS rise times depend on ǫx, ǫy, and σp. Note that a 4th
equation, the relation between σs and σp, is also implied; generally this is
taken to be the nominal (zero current) relationship.

Piwinski suggests iterating Eqs. 10 until a self-consistent solution is
found. Our experience is that this has the problem that negative values
of emittance or σ2
p can be obtained with this procedure, causing diﬃculty
in knowing how to continue the iteration. We ﬁnd that a better method is
to convert these equations into 3 coupled diﬀerential equations, such as is
done in Ref. [13] to obtain the time development of the beam properties in
a ring. Here, however, we use it only as a mathematical device for ﬁnding
the steady-state solution. For example, the equation for ǫx becomes

We have three comments: (1) In a storage ring vertical emittance is

distortion. Although our formalism technically is valid only for the case of
no x-y coupling, we believe that it can also be used for the case of weak

rxy0 = ǫy0/ǫx0, and then set ǫy0 accordingly. Note that rxy0 is meant to
include both the contributions of x-y coupling and of vertical dispersion.
Finally, note that the vertical emittance, assuming only vertical dispersion,
can be approximated by[14]

currents (
we do appear to have a sizeable potential well bunch lengthening eﬀect.
We will assume that this case can be approximated by adding the proper
multiplicative factor fpw(N ), obtained from measurements, to the equation
giving σs in terms of σp. (3) As mentioned earlier, the IBS bunch distri-
butions are not Gaussian, and tail particles can be overemphasized in the
beam size solutions given above. T. Raubenheimer in Ref. [10] gives a way
of estimating IBS beam sizes that better reﬂect the particles in the core of
the beam. Note that the optics computer program SAD can solve the IBS
equations of B-M, include the eﬀects of orbit errors, and also ﬁnd the sizes
of the core of the beam.

Parameter Studies

We have programmed the above Piwinski equations. We have also pro-
grammed the B-M equations, which also give 3 IBS growth rates (though
there is a factor of 2 diﬀerence in their deﬁnition). Let us begin our nu-
merical studies by comparing the results of the two programs when applied
to the ATF lattice and beam properties. (Note that there is a published
comparison of results of these two methods applied to the CERN AA ring
in Ref. [15]; however, the variation of the lattice parameters around the ring
was not included in the P method calculation.) As parameters we take:
10−4, σs0 = 5.06 mm (for an rf voltage of
E = 1.28 GeV, σp0 = 5.44
300 kV), ǫx0 = 1.05 nm, τp = 20.9 ms, τx = 18.2 ms, and τx = 29.2 ms.

might expect some disagreement between the two methods. Note that for
the averages represented by brackets in Eqs. 2-4, and their counterparts in
the B-M method, we calculate, as is normally done, the appropriate com-
bination of lattice and beam properties at the ends of the lattice elements,
connect these with straight lines, and then ﬁnd the average of the resulting
curve.

Fig. 1 displays the 3 diﬀerential IBS growth rates as obtained by the
two methods (blue for P, red for B-M) when I = 3.1 mA and rxy0 = .01.
The IBS growth rates are just the average values over the ring of these
functions. Since the ATF has two-fold symmetry we give the result for only
half the ring (the straight section is in the middle). Here we include no
vertical dispersion, i.e. the vertical emittance is presumed to be only due to
(weak) x-y coupling, and fpw is set to 1. We see almost perfect agreement
for the diﬀerential growth rates obtained by the two methods, with only
slight diﬀerences in the peaks. As for the averages, for the Piwinski method
1/Tp = 28.4 s−1, 1/Tx = 24.8 s−1, and 1/Ty = .67 s−1. The B-M results
are 28.9, 26.2, and .58 s−1, respectively. Note that the y growth rates
are very small. As for the steady state beam properties, for this example
σp/σp0 = 1.566, ǫx/ǫx0 = 1.825, and ǫy/ǫx0 = .0102 for P, and 1.587, 1.910,
.0102 for B-M, respectively. We see that for the ATF the results of the
two methods are almost the same. Finally, note that when making the same
φx|
comparison for the ALS at Berkeley, a low emittance light source with βx|
comparable to Dx, we again ﬁnd very close agreement in the results of the
two methods.

In the ATF the rms vertical dispersion, after correction, is typically 3-

these with straight lines (see Fig. 2a). This was added to the P calculation.
In the ATF typically rxy0
Jǫ = 1.4. We see from Eq. 12 that if
(Dy)rms = 4 mm, then 30% of the low current emittance is due to dispersion,
and the rest due to x-y coupling. Let us consider an example now where
the size of ǫy0 is given entirely by vertical dispersion, with rxy0 = .01 and
(Dy)rms = 7.5 mm. In Fig. 2b we plot the resulting δ(1/Ty) at I = 3.1 mA.
The growth is much larger than before, with 1/Ty = 11.8 s−1. (Note that
σp/σp0 = 1.48, ǫx/ǫx0 = 1.71, and ǫy/ǫx0 = .015.) We can understand the
change in 1/Ty if we look back at the equations for the growth rates in x
and y, Eqs. 3 and 4. In Eq. 3 the horizontal growth rate is dominated by
the second term in the brackets, the one proportional to D2
xβ. In Eq. 4

We see that the Piwinski and the Bjorken-Mtingwa methods give essen-

vertical dispersion, we will choose to continue our simulations using this
method. In Figs. 3-5 we give the steady-state emittance and energy spread
vs. various parameters in the ATF according to Piwinski’s IBS theory.

dence on I, with fpw = 1, rxy0 = .01. We note that the vertical emittance
growth is almost zero with zero vertical dispersion. At (Dy)rms = 6 mm,
ǫy has increased by 44% by I = 3 mA. In Fig. 4 we show the dependence
on rxy0, with fpw = 1, I = 3.1 mA. We note that at rxy0 = 0 the vertical
emittance does not go to zero when (Dy)rms is not zero. Note also that for
the case (Dy)rms = 6 mm, the σp(rxy0) curve is rather linear over the range
shown, with a slope ∆σp/σp/∆rxy0 = 6.6; i.e. an (absolute) change in rxy0
of 0.005 produces a relative change in σp of only 3%. In Fig. 5 we give the
dependence on fpw, with I = 3.1 mA, rxy0 = .01. Note that at I = 3 mA,
the ATF measurements give fpw = 1.25. We see that the energy spread and
emittances are not very sensitive to this parameter. For example, a change
of .1 in fpw yields a 1% change in σp.

Measurements[1]-[3]

In April 2000, σp, σs, ǫx, and ǫy were all measured as functions of current to
varying degrees of accuracy. Among the most accurate is believed to be the
energy spread measurement, which is performed on a thin screen at a high
dispersion region in the extraction line (Dx = 1.73 m). At diﬀerent currents
the measured beam width was ﬁt to a Gaussian (the ﬁts were very good) and
the rms width was extracted. This measurement was performed on April 14
(see Fig. 6a). The rms scatter in the extracted σp was less than 2%, and the
precision should be better than 1%. Note that although data was obtained
2 mA only, from experience we have conﬁdence that we

The rms bunch length, using a streak camera, was also measured about
the same time, and there was more scatter in the data(see Fig. 6b). With
streak camera measurements, however, there is always the question of whe-
ther space charge in the streak camera itself could have added a systematic
error to the results. Checks were made with light ﬁlters, so we don’t think
this is a problem, but this still adds a slight uncertainty to the results. Both
results were ﬁt to a smooth curve, chosen to give the expected zero current
results (see Fig. 6). Note that these results, if true, imply an extremely large
bunch length increase at low currents.

∼

The emittances were measured on wire monitors in the extraction line on
April 19. The results are reproduced by the plotting symbols in Fig. 7b-c.
We see that the x emittance appears to grow by
80% by I = 3 mA; the y
emittance begins at about 1% of the x emittance, and then grows by a factor
of 3. We believe that the x-emittance measured should be fairly accurate.
The y-emittance, however, since it is so small, could be corrupted by many
factors, such as dispersion in the extraction line or the wire monitors (roll of
the measurement wires, for example, has been checked and shown not to be
.01. We estimated above, using
signiﬁcant). Note that it appears that rxy0
Eq. 12, that if the vertical emittance is dominated by vertical dispersion,
then rxy0 = .01 implies that (Dy)rms = 7.5 mm, which is signiﬁcantly larger
than the measured 3-4 mm. Unfortunately, we do not know what Dy(s) was
during the April measurements, and therefore cannot make a more precise
comparison with calculation.

∼

Note that all the measurements were not performed on the same day,
and since IBS depends on the status of the machine (e.g. on the vertical
closed orbit distortion), it is possible that the longitudinal and transverse
measurements correspond to slightly diﬀerent machines as far as IBS is con-
cerned. For example, on April 13, the day before the σp measurements of
Fig. 6, the energy spread was also measured. Those results, when ﬁtted and
extrapolated to I = 3 mA, gave a 2% smaller rms value than given here.
This adds some uncertainty to our results.

Comparison with IBS Theory

To study the consistency of these measurements with IBS theory, we per-
form IBS calculations where we take the potential well factor fpw that was
measured, and adjust rxy0 to obtain the measured σp (and σs) at I = 3 mA,
[Remember: the typical measured
for the cases (Dy)rms = 3 and 6 mm.

12

value is (Dy)rms = 3-4 mm.] The best ﬁts were found for rxy0 = .0104 and
.006, for the cases (Dy)rms = 3 and 6 mm, respectively. The results are
shown in Fig. 7, where they are compared to the measured data. (Note that
in Fig. 7a, we reproduce, using plotting symbols, the smooth curve ﬁts to
the measured data of Fig. 6.)

We ﬁrst notice that whether there is a 3 mm or 6 mm y dispersion the
ﬁtted results are very similar. We ﬁnd for our ﬁtted results that the ǫx de-
pendence on current is in reasonable agreement with measurement (though
the calculated result is low by 10% at 3 mA), and that rxy0
.006-.01,
which is a little low compared to .01. The biggest discrepancy, however,
seems to be that the vertical emittance growth is much lower for the calcu-
lations than the measurements: for the case (Dy)rms = 3 mm we see 10%
growth by 3 mA; for (Dy)rms = 6 mm we see 60% growth by 3 mA, which,
however, is not close to the factor of 3 that was measured.

∼

ATF measurement data (symbols) and IBS theory ﬁts (the
Figure 7:
curves). The symbols in (a) give the smooth curve ﬁts to the measured
data of Fig. 6. In the theory the parameter rxy0 was adjusted to get the
measured σp at I = 3 mA.

Let us suppose that the measured vertical emittance growth is not real,
and is due to measurement error. In such a case, our results appear to give

13

reasonable agreement between IBS theory and the ATF measurements, for
σp, σs, and ǫx vs. I, and low current ǫy, all without extra fudge factors. For
the present set of data, however, we are still left with some uncertainties.
For example, it was suggested earlier that the accurate knowledge of σp(I)
is important. It was shown that for a realistic type of vertical dispersion
for the ATF, (Dy)rms = 6 mm, at I = 3.1 mA, a change in rxy0 of .005
produces a relative change in σp of only 3%. Or, conversely, if the inaccuracy
in σp(3 mA) is 3%, then the ﬁtted rxy0 shifts by .005, which is not small
compared to .01. And from the measured diﬀerence in σp on April 13 and
14, it seems that the uncertainty in σp is of this order. Finally, we should
note that another source of uncertainty is that we don’t know the function
Dy(s) on the date of the measurements.

However, there is one major quantative discrepancy between theory and
measurement, which has to do with non-Gaussian beam tails. SAD ﬁnds
that for the ATF the IBS induced emittance growth, when not counting such
tail particles, is only 2/3 of that when all particles are included (or 80% in
the case of σp), in agreement with calculations for the ATF given in Ref. [10].
Our calculations include all beam particles, while the measurements consider
If the tail particles are indeed as signiﬁcant as these
only core particles.
results suggest, then the eﬀect measured at the ATF is much stronger than
predicted by IBS theory, and there would no longer be good agreement with
measurement. If one wants to think about a fudge factor that is multiplied
1.5-2.0
with the bunch charge, then we estimate that this factor must be
(though no single such factor gives good agreement for all σp(I), σs(I), and
ǫx(I)). From this result, it appears that either there is another, unknown
force in addition to IBS causing emittance growth in the ATF, or the problem
is the approximate nature of IBS theory.

∼

In spite of this discrepancy, we believe that the IBS eﬀect will be useful
as a diagnostic at the ATF. However, before we can use it as such, we need
to perform more benchmarking experiments. Such measurements include
the eﬀects of varying the rf voltage, the vertical dispersion, and the x-y
coupling. Additional independent measurements are also desireable, such
as using the interferometer to measure the beam sizes in the ring. The
In
calculations can also be improved by including a cut-oﬀ for the tails.
addition, one might, for example, include the measured vertical dispersion
(instead of a randomly generated one) and/or use Piwinski’s more involved
formulation that properly includes linear coupling.

Conclusion

Our theoretical comparisons suggest that the ATF measurement results of
April 2000 for energy spread, bunch length, and horizontal emittance vs.
current, and a low current emittance ratio of about 1% are generally con-
sistent with intrabeam scattering (IBS) theory, though the measured eﬀects
appear to be stronger than theory.
In particular, the measured factor of
3 growth in vertical emittance at 3 mA does not seem to be supported.
It appears that either (1) there is another, unknown force in addition to
IBS causing emittance growth in the ATF; or (2) the factor of 3 vertical
emittance growth is not real, and our other discrepancies are due to the ap-
proximate nature of IBS theory. Our results suggest, in addition, that, even
if IBS theory has inaccuracies, the eﬀect will be useful as a diagnostic in the
ATF. For example, by measuring the energy spread, one will be able to ob-
tain the emittances. Before this can be done, however, more benchmarking
measurements will be needed.

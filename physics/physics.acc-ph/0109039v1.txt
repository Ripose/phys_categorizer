Abstract. We suggest a new type of the undulator radiation which is generated
by an ultra-relativistic particle channeled along a periodically bent crystallographic
plane or axis. The electromagnetic radiation arises mainly due to the bending of
the particle’s trajectory, which follows the shape of the channel. The parameters of
this undulator, which totally deﬁne the spectrum and the angular distribution of the
radiation (both spontaneous and stimulated), depend on the type of the crystal and
the crystallographic plane (axis), on the type of a projectile and its energy, and on
the shape of the bent channel, and, thus, can be varied signiﬁcantly by varying these
characteristics.

As an example, we consider the acoustically induced radiation (AIR) which is
generated by ultra-relativistic particles channeled in a crystal which is bent by a
transverse acoustic wave. The AIR mechanism allows to make the undulator with
the main parameters varying in wide ranges, which are inaccessible in the undulators
based on the motion of particles in the periodic magnetic ﬁelds and also in the ﬁeld of
the laser radiation. The intensity of AIR can be easily made larger than the intensity
of the radiation in a linear crystal and can be varied in a wide range by varying the
frequency and the amplitude of the acoustic wave in the crystal.

A possibility to generate stimulated emission of high-energy photons (in kev–MeV

region) is also discussed.

We suggest a new type of the undulator radiation generated by an ultra-relativistic

particle during its channeling in periodically bent crystal.

The novel feature, introduced into the radiative channeling process by a periodically
bent channel is that the oscillations of the particle in the transverse direction become the
eﬀective source of radiation of an undulator type due to the constructive interference
of the photons emitted from spatially separated but similar parts of the projectile’s
trajectory.

The phenomenon of the channeling radiation of a charged projectile in a linear
[1], [2]) as well as in a “simple” (i.e. non-periodic) bent channel
crystal (see eg.
[3] are known, although in the latter case the theoretical and experimental data are
much less extensive so far. The theory and various practical implementations of the
electromagnetic radiation by a charge moving in spatially periodic static magnetic ﬁelds
(a magnetic undulator), in the laser ﬁeld (a laser-based undulator) have long history
[4, 5] and are well elaborated [1], [2], [6]. It is also known (see eg. [1]) that a positively
charged ultra-relativistic particle, undergoing a planar channeling in a linear crystal,
radiates electromagnetic waves whose spectral and angular distributions are those of
the undulator (a natural undulator) due to the transverse oscillations caused by the
action of the repulsive interplanar potential. Although, the features of the natural
undulator radiation are blurred due to the distribution of the particles in the beam over
the transverse energy and over the entering angle.

In this work we demonstrate, that the system “ultra-relativistic charged particle +
periodically bent crystal channel” represents by itself a new type of the undulator and,
consequently, serves as a new source of the undulator radiation of high intensity levels,
monochromaticity and a particular pattern of the angular-frequency distribution. The
electromagnetic radiation in this undulator arises mainly due to the bending of particle’s
trajectory, which follows the shape of the channel. The parameters of this undulator, as
well as the characteristics of the electromagnetic radiation, depend on the type of the
crystal and its crystallographic plane (axis), on the type of a projectile and its energy,
and are also dependent on the shape of the bent channel, and, thus, can be varied
signiﬁcantly by varying the enlisted characteristics.

For the undulator described above the essential point is the existence of the bent
channel of a periodic shape. Two realistic ways of a “preparation” of such a channel
could be discussed.
It is feasible, by means of mordern technology [7], to grow the
crystal with its channels being statically bent according to a particular pattern. Another
possibility, a dynamically bent crystal, arises if one considers propagation of the acoustic
wave (AW) along some particular direction in a crystal, see ﬁgure 1. Under the action
of the AW the crystal channels, linear initially, will also be bent periodically. In both
cases the passage of an ultra-relativistic particle along the bent channel gives rise to the
undulator radiation due to the curvature of the trajectory, provided that the projectile

3

is trapped into the channel. The latter condition is subject to the general condition for
the channeling process in a bent crystal [3, 7], and can be fulﬁlled by a proper choice of
projectile energy and maximal curvature of the channel, as described below.

Figure 1. Schematic representation of the initially linear planar channel bent by
the AW. The notations are: d is the channel width, a, λ are the AW amplitude and
wavelength, respectively. The parameter θ0 is the maximal polar angle of the photon
emission (see explanations in the text).

The advantage of the static channel is that its parameters are ﬁxed and thus the
projectile moves along the ﬁxed trajectory as well. To calculate the characteristics of
the emitted radiation one needs to know only the number of the periods and the local
cuvature radius. The disadvantage is that when ﬁxing the number of periods then the
undulator parameters can be varied only by changing the energy of the particle. This
makes the undulator less tunable.

The important feature of the dynamically bent crystal by means of an AW is that it
Nu and p varying in wide ranges,
allows to consider an undulator with the parameters
†
which are determined not only by the projectile’s energy but by the AW frequency
and amplitude as well. The two latter quantities can be easily tuned resulting in the
possibility to vary signiﬁcantly the intensity and the shape of the angular distribution
of the radiation, which hereforth will be referred as acoustically induced radiation, AIR.
The intensity of AIR can be made larger than the radiation intensity emitted by
a charged particle channeled in an oriented linear crystal [8] (see also [3]). The AIR
mechanism allows to make an undulator with the parameters Nu and p changing in a
wide range which is inaccessible for undulators based on the motion of charged particles
in periodic magnetic ﬁelds and also in the ﬁeld of the laser radiation [2], [6]. In the
suggested scheme, AIR is generated by the relativistic charged particles, with relativistic

Nu is the number of periods in the undulator and p = 2πγ a/λ is its parameter (see ﬁgure 1).

factors γ = ε/mc2
1 (c is the velocity of light, m is the mass of the projectile and
ε is its energy). The large range of γ available in modern colliders at present or in
near future for various charged particles, both light and heavy, and the wide range of
frequencies and amplitudes possible for AW in crystals both allow to generate the AIR
photons with the energies up to the TeV region [8].

≫

The speciﬁc pattern of the undulator radiation combined with the AIR mechanism
allows, to our opinion, to discuss the possibility of creating a powerful source of
stimulated monochromatic radiation of high-energy photons.

In this letter we consider the simplest case, when the initially linear planar channel
(the case of the axial channel is treated analogously) is bent periodically under the action
of the transverse monochromatic AW transmitted along the channel (see ﬁgure 1) with
the velocity vt. Let ν, λ = vt/ν and a be the AW frequency, wave length and amplitude,
respectively. The bending of the channel becomes signiﬁcant if the AW amplitude, a, is
larger than the interplanar distance, d, i.e. a

≫
The conditions which must be fulﬁlled to consider the system “AW + channeled
particle” as an undulator are the following. Let the time of ﬂight, τ = L/c, of the
particle through the crystal of the thickness L, be much smaller than the AW period T :
T . This allows to disregard the variations of the shape of the channel during the
τ
≪
time τ .

d.

The channeling process in a bent crystal takes place if the maximal centrifugal force
in the channel, mγv2/Rmin (where Rmin is the minimum curvature radius of the bent
channel) is less than the maximal interplanar ﬁeld U ′

max [3, 7]:

mγv2/Rmin < q U ′

max.

where q is the charge of the projectile. Provided (1) is fulﬁlled, the projectile, which
enters the crystal under the angle θ much less than the critical angle θL, will move,
being trapped in the channel, along the trajectory:

y(x) = a sin

2π

x = [0 . . . L]

x
λ (cid:19)

,

(cid:18)

The minimum curvature radius of this trajectory is equal to Rmin = (λ/2π)2/a. Thus,
a decrease in Rmin and, consequently, an increase in the maximum acceleration of the
particle in the channel is achieved by decreasing λ and increasing a. As a result, photon
emission due to the projectile’s acceleration in the bent channel may be signiﬁcantly
enhanced. This radiation is emitted coherently from similar parts of the trajectory, and
may dominate [8] over the radiation caused by the acceleration of the particle in the
linear channel.

Both the motion of the projectile in the bent channel and the spectrum of the
generated electromagnetic radiation are of the undulator-type, only if λ

the channeling particle oscillates many times within the length L of the crystal. As any

ω0, and the undulator parameter, p. These quantities, which determine the radiation
spectrum, are dependent on λ, a and on the relativistic factor γ, and are deﬁned as

dashed lines correspond the constant values of the parameter N both for positron and

Figure 2 demonstrates that the parameters p and N vary in wide ranges: N = 1...100,

p = 0.1
values of p’s are larger by more than an order of magnitude than those accessible in the
undulators based on the motion of the charged particles in periodic magnetic ﬁelds and
also those in the ﬁeld of the laser radiation [2], [6].

Expression (5) together with the deﬁnitons (6a)-(6c) clearly exhibits the features
intrinsic to the undulator radiation [6]. The intensity of radiation is proportional to
N 2
u (Nu = L/λ). The spectral and angular behaviour of the radiation are determined
mainly by the function DN (η), which has sharp maxima (each of constant width 2/Nu)

All these features are illustrated in ﬁgures 3 and 4, where the angular-spectral

The parameters of the AW are indicated in ﬁgure 3, which represents the spectral
distribution of the radiation in the case of the forward emission (θ = 0◦). It is seen that
all harmonics are well separated: the width of each peak is
1 MeV whilst the distance
between two neighbouring peaks is

Two other important characteristics of the radiation, which allow to discuss the
possibility of the stimulated emission, can be obtained from (5). For simplicity we
consider here the case of the classical limit ¯hω

Another quantity to be estimated is the gain, gK, which deﬁnes the increase (the
case gK > 0) or the decrease (if gK < 0) per 1 cm in the total number, NK, of the
emitted photons of the frequency ωK, dNK = gK NK dz, due to the stimulated emission

where λc = ¯h/mc is the Compton wavelength and rcl = e2/mc2 is the classical radius
10−13 cm for a positron). The quantities λ
of a particle (λc = 3.9
·
and ρ are measured in cm and cm−3, respectively. Note the strong inverse dependence
of gK on γ which is due to the radiative recoil. The gain is proportional to the factor
N 2
u , which reﬂects the coherence eﬀect of radiation. The proportionality of the gain to
λ means that the increase in λ leads to the enchancement of the radiation intensity in
the forward direction.

Formulas (11) and (13) allow to make quantitative estimates concerning the

possibility to obtain the stimulated emission of the high-energy photons.

Consider the case of the positron beam channeled in a carbon crystal. It is seen
from ﬁgure 2, that the number of the undulator periods per 1 cm, N, can be easily
varied in the range N = 1 . . . 100 by tuning the AW parameters. Therefore, the number
of the photons (per particle) corresponding to the ﬁrst harmonic, K = 1, with the
energy ¯hω1, and emitted in the crystal of the thickness L is varied within the interval:
1. Note that Nω1 is independent on γ.
Nω1 = 0.07
≫
For numerical estimations we chose N = 20 cm−1, which corresponds to the AW
frequency ν = 23.3 MHz. Other parameters used are: L = 10 cm, p2 = 10. The
calculated number of the photons is equal to Nω1 = 14. To obtain the gain g1 = 1 cm−1
(and, thus, the total gain G1
g1 L = 10) at diﬀerent energies ε it is necessary to use
the ρ-values given in table 1, calculated from (13).

It is seen from table 1 that the estimated ρ-values strongly depend on the relativistic
factor. Note that even the lagest value of ρ, 1022 particles in cm3, is comparable with
that planned to achieve within the TESLA project [10].

Our investigation shows that the described phenomenon can be used for the
construction of the undulator with variable parameters for the generation of high energy
photons. Also it is shown, that it is meaningful to discuss the possibility to create a
powerful source of stimulated monochromatic radiation in the keV and the MeV regions.
A more accurate treatment, which is presently carried out, must take into account the
eﬀects neglected in the present study. These are: the channeling radiation (which
accompanies the passage of the channeled particle), the dechanneling processes (which
lead to the decrease in the beam intensity and thus inﬂuence the yield of the photons),
the decrease of the emitted photons ﬂux due to the processes of diﬀraction and pair-
creation, the non-monochromaticity of the AW, the temperature of the particles in the
beam, the transverse energy distribution of the beam particles and, as a result, the
distribution of the particles in the initial entering angle.

We express our gratitute to Professor H. Klein for helpful discussion. The authors

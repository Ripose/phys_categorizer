FURTHER STUDIES ON THE PROSPECTS FOR MANY-TEV MUON

COLLIDERS ∗

B.J. King, BNL, Upton, NY 11973, USA

Abstract
New self-consistent parameter sets are presented and dis-
cussed for muon collider rings at center-of-mass energies
of 10, 30 and 100 TeV. All three parameter sets attain lumi-
nosities of L = 3 × 1035 cm−2.s−1. The parameter sets
beneﬁt from new insights gained at the HEMC’99 work-
shop [3] that considered the feasibility of many-TeV muon
colliders.

INTRODUCTION

Table 1 of this paper presents self-consistent parameter sets
for muon collider storage rings at center-of-mass energies
of ECoM = 10, 30 and 100 TeV. The parameter sets have
beneﬁtted and evolved from previous attempts at deﬁning
plausible parameter sets for many-TeV muon colliders. It
is helpful to begin by reviewing these previous studies and
their motivation in order to provide a context for the dis-
cussion of the current parameters.

Parameter sets for muon collider rings at energies up to
ECoM = 100 TeV were presented in 1998 [1] and 1999 [2].
Following this, a much improved level of understanding
was then obtained from the ﬁrst substantial dedicated study
of such many-TeV muon colliders, which took place at the
week-long HEMC’99 workshop [3]. The majority of the
studies at HEMC’99 either assumed or critiqued straw-man
parameter sets [4], one at ECoM = 10 and two at 100 TeV,
that were provided expressly for this purpose.

Besides presenting an overview of the HEMC’99 param-
eter sets, reference [4] also reviewed the feed-back on the
parameters that was provided by the workshop. This pa-
per should be referred to for many discussions that remain
relevant for the current parameter sets of table 1.

The 48 participants at HEMC’99 considered side-by-
side the accelerator challenges and the high energy physics
(HEP) potential of many-TeV muon colliders. The HEP
motivation for the workshop was very strong because ex-
perimental discoveries in HEP normally come from ad-
vances in energy reach, as has been emphasized and dis-
cussed in, for example, references [5] and [6]. HEP discus-
sions speciﬁc to many-TeV muon colliders can be found
in [7] and, mainly, in the HEMC’99 Proceedings [3].

Of the three many-TeV parameter sets in table 1, those at
10 TeV and 100 TeV evolved directly from the correspond-
ing 10 TeV and (the ﬁrst of the) 100 TeV parameter sets for
HEMC’99, taking into account the constructive criticisms
that emerged from the workshop. A mid-point energy was
considered valuable for examining parameter trends with

increasing energy, and the 30 TeV parameter set provides
such an interpolation between the lower and higher energy
sets.

Invaluable benchmarks for all of these many-TeV studies
were provided by lower energy parameters that have been
studied and evaluated [8, 9] by the Muon Collider Collabo-
ration (MCC). The ﬁrst column of table 1 shows, for com-
parison, the range of parameters for the muon colliders in
the range ECoM = 0.1, 3 TeV from the MCC’s status re-
port [9].

2 DISCUSSION ON PARAMETER SETS

The energy scale and some other parameter choices in ta-
ble 1 were strongly inﬂuenced by considerations of syn-
chrotron radiation. This imposes a natural cut-off scale for
circular muon storage rings in the range ECoM ∼ 100 TeV
since the synchrotron radiation loss at such energies has
risen rapidly to become comparable to the beam power.
At HEMC’99, Telnov made the additional observation [10]
that the quantum nature of the sychrotron radiation could
lead to beam heating, rather than cooling, for sufﬁciently
high beam energies and small emittances. This observa-
tion effectively invalidated the more aggressive of the two
HEMC’99 parameter sets at 100 TeV – which therefore
won’t be discussed further in this paper – and also cast
some doubt on the 100 TeV parameter set with the larger
emittance.

The synchrotron radiation concerns were addressed in

the 100 TeV parameter set in table 1 by:

1. raising the emittance in each of the transverse coordi-
nates by the large factor of 90. This should comfort-
ably address Telnov’s concern and result in net syn-
chrotron cooling by raising the horizontal emittance
to well above the quantum break-even value

2. increasing the collider ring circumference by a fac-
tor of two and, correspondingly, reducing the average
bending magnetic ﬁeld by a factor of two, to 5.3 Tesla

3. reducing the average beam current by nearly a factor

of 2, to 4 mA.

The combined effect of the second and third changes was
to reduce the synchrotron radiation to 50 MW, down from
the previous, somewhat problematic level of 195 MW in
the HEMC’99 parameter set. Although still a factor of 2.5
larger than the synchrotron power at LEP II, this reduced
level was considered very appropriate for a far future col-
lider at the energy frontier.

These changes should also help to address reservations
expressed by Harrison [11] at HEMC’99 about the feasi-

bility of 10 Tesla cosine theta dipoles in the presence of
large amounts of synchrotron radiation. Besides lowering
the average required magnetic ﬁeld by a factor of two, it
is noted that the synchrotron radiation power deposited per
unit length around the collider ring has fallen by almost a
factor of 8 from the HEMC’99 parameter set at 100 TeV.

In addition to the adjustments just mentioned that were
speciﬁc to the 100 TeV parameter set, all three many-TeV
parameter sets in table 1 were made more conservative than
the HEMC’99 parameter sets in several areas:

• in recognition of the difﬁculty and novelty of ioniza-
tion cooling, the phase space densities in table 1 were
all scaled back to coincide with the upper end of the
parameter choices from reference [9] for lower energy
muon colliders, i.e. 2.4 × 1022 m−3.

• the ﬁnal focus parameters are perhaps the most dif-
ﬁcult of all for a non-specialist to evaluate. As has
been discussed in references [1, 2, 4], the ﬁnal focus
difﬁculty can be usefully benchmarked to other muon
collider and e+e− collider parameter sets according
to the value of 3 parameters in particular: the β∗ in
the x and y coordinates and of two other deﬁned pa-
rameters, the so-called “demagniﬁcation factor” and
“chromaticity quality factor”. All three benchmark
parameters have been somewhat relaxed in response
to feed-back [4] from the studies by ﬁnal focus lattice
experts at HEMC’99. Further explicit magnet lattice
designs, now for each of the three parameter sets in
table 1, would be invaluable for assessing whether the
new, more relaxed parameters have reached an accept-
able level of plausibility

• the average beam currents and resulting beam powers
were reduced so that the worst case, at 100 TeV, had
a summed beam plus synchrotron power of 180 MW,
i.e. comparable to the 170 MW beam power that has
been under consideration for the Accelerator Produc-
tion of Tritium project [12]

• the beam-beam tune disruption parameter was low-
ered slightly for all three sets to a value, in the worst
case, of ∆ν = 0.091. This is not far above the im-
pressive new LEP II record of ∆ν = 0.083 that was
reported in this conference [13].

The unavoidable cost of these relaxed machine param-
eters was to lower the luminosity to L = 3 × 1035
cm−2.s−1 for each of the 10, 30 and 100 TeV param-
eters. This is a reduction to 30% of the luminosities,
L = 1 × 1036 cm−2.s−1, of the corresponding HEMC’99
parameter sets for 10 TeV and 100 TeV. To put this in per-
spective, the new luminosities are still orders of magnitude
higher than at any existing colliders and are also higher
than any speculated parameters the author is aware of for
plausible future machines other than muon colliders.

3 SUMMARY

The extremely high constituent particle energies and lu-
minosities of the parameter sets presented in table 1 con-
tinue to emphasize the impressive potential of muon col-
liders for exploring the energy frontier of elementary par-
ticle physics. Therefore, further paper studies and simu-
lations for many-TeV muon colliders should continue to
play a valuable role in our ﬁeld. More speciﬁcally, the pa-
rameter sets presented in this paper would certainly beneﬁt
from feed-back and constructive criticism by experts in ar-
eas such as the design of ﬁnal focus lattices.

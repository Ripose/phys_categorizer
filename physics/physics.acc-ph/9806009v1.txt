Dielectric properties of interacting storage ring plasmas

A. Selchow, K. Morawetz
Fachbereich Physik, Universit¨at Rostock, D-18051 Rostock, Germany
(July 22, 2013)

A dielectric function including collisional correlations is derived by linearizing the self consistent
Vlasov equation with a Fokker-Planck collision integral. The calculation yields the same type of
dielectric function as in the standard-theory of Schottky-noise in storage rings. This dielectric
function is compared with the Mermin-dielectric function derived from a kinetic equation with
relaxation time approximation. We observe that these functions are identical, however the Mermin-
DF is computationally advantageous. The limits of both dielectric functions are given and the sum
rules are proven. We apply these dielectric functions for typical storage ring plasmas and calculate
the stopping power and the plasmon excitation spectrum.

I. INTRODUCTION

During the last ten years experiments with ions ( p+
up to U92+) in storage rings gained importance in the
ﬁeld of spectroscopy and plasma physics. The storaged
and cooled ion beams have a high luminosity for recom-
bination experiments and inertial conﬁned fusion inves-
tigations. In particular it is of basic interest to study the
transition between the weak and strong coupled plasma
or even the transition to a crystalline state of a cooled
ion beam [1]. The most important prerequisite for ob-
taining dense states is strong electron and laser cooling.
The electron cooling force can be described as stopping
power acting on an ion beam in an electron plasma [2].
Another plasma phenomena in dense beams are collective
excitations (plasmons, shear modes) which are detectable
by the Schottky noise [3]. All items - the pair distribu-
tion function of a state, the stopping power and the shape
of the collective excitations are related to the dielectric
function ǫ(~q, ω).

Within the linear response theory the polarizability
Π(~q, ω) (and altogether the dielectric function ǫ(~q, ω)) is
deﬁned by the variation of particle density δn(~q, ω) in
reaction to an external ﬁeld δUext(~q, ω) via

Π(~q, ω) =

δn(~q, ω)
δUext

.

The connection to the dielectric function (DF) is given
by

ǫ(~q, ω) = 1 + VC Π(~q, ω) .

The captured ions in storage rings are moving in front
of a background of the conﬁning ﬁelds ensuring approxi-
mately the charge neutrality in the system. This nearly
neutral system of ions interacting via the Coulomb po-
tential VC immersed in a homogeneous background of op-
posite charge is usually called an one-component-plasma
(OCP).

An unpleasant problem is the temperature anisotropy.
The longitudinal temperature (Tk) diﬀers from the
transversal (T⊥) (referring to the beam-axis) because
only the longitudinal direction is cooled directly. Even
taking into account relaxation processes between the de-
grees of freedom and possible transversal cooling the tem-
perature diﬀerence maintains.

In this paper we focus on experiments done by the
Heidelberg TSR group with 9Be+ and 12C6+ ions cooled
by an electron beam [1,4]. The Be-ions can be cooled
further down to few mK by applying laser cooling.

For estimations about the ideality and collision-
numbers we employ the longitudinal temperature Tk.
The density of the ion beam can be calculated using the
current j of the beam proﬁle (the diameter) measured
by the beam proﬁle monitors xBP M and the value of the
betatron function on this position βBP M

The validity of these sum rules is an essential statement

The collisions between the ions play an essential role
in this storage-ring-plasmas being responsible for eﬀects
like intra-beam scattering (IBS) [5]. That means an ex-
pansion of the (ion) beam due to ion-ion collisions has
to be suppressed by electron cooling. Consequently for a
suﬃcient description a dielectric function ǫ(~q, ω) includ-
ing these collisions should be considered [6]. In this paper
two practical ways will be shown in chapter II.

An essential property of every dielectric function is the
fulﬁllment of the sum rules. The most strongest are the
longitudinal frequency sum rule

II. DIELECTRIC FUNCTIONS WITH
CORRELATIONS

A. Mermin-dielectric function

For calculating a dielectric function including collisions
between the particles with mass m, N. D. Mermin [7]
suggested a particle number conserving dielectric func-
tion. We shortly sketch his derivation for the classical
case starting with a kinetic equation in relaxation time
approximation

This kinetic equation describes the development of a par-
ticle distribution function f (~r, ~v, t) consisting of an equi-
librium part f0(~v) and a non-equilibrium part δf (~r, ~v, t)

f (~r, ~v, t) = f0(~v) + δf (~r, ~v, t) .

(13)

The mean ﬁeld U (~r, t) is composed of an external part
and a part arising from the induced particle density δn

U ( ~q, ω) = δUext + V δn(~q, ω) .

(14)

One gets the induced particle density δn by linearization
of (12) and integrating the solution of δf over the velocity
~v. After Fourier transformation t

B. The Vlasov-Fokker-Planck Equation

Now we examine another kinetic equation - the Vlasov
equation with the Fokker-Planck collision integral which
has been used to predict the Schottky noise of an ion
beam [3]

(25)

The application of the Fokker-Planck collision term is
valid for weak collisions (it means low q-values) because
it represents an expansion of the collision integral in mo-
mentum space. With the collision integral of the Fokker-
Planck equation one includes the ﬂuctuations of the dis-
tribution function due to collisions. It describes the bal-
ance between dynamical friction λ ∂
∂~v (~vf (~r, ~v, t)) holding
the velocity-distribution sharply near zero-velocity and
the diﬀusion D ∂
∂v2 f (~r, ~v, t) ﬂattening the velocity distri-
bution. The coeﬃcients λ and D in the Fokker-Planck
equation are related by the Einstein relation

.

(26)

As already mentioned above the friction coeﬃcient λ is
equal to the inverse relaxation time. Obviously, the drift
coeﬃcient λ~v is linear in the velocity as long as the dif-
fusion coeﬃcient D is a constant. The Fokker-Planck
collision term ensures the particle conservation. Due to
the Einstein relation we have a proper balance between
friction and diﬀusion. So we expect that similar physics
is included as the Mermin extension of the simple relax-
ation time approximation in the last paragraph.

We solve this Fokker-Planck equation again within the
linear response. A sketch of the derivation can be found
in appendix A with the result for the dielectric function

This dielectric function has been given in [3] and is valid
for an isotropic plasma in three dimensions.

and fulﬁlls all sum rules (8)-(11). Shifting the frequency
into the complex plane according to 16 one gets the relax-
ation dielectric function. This expression does not fulﬁll
the limit of static screening and has a non Drude-like
high frequency behavior which leads to a violation of the
sum rules (8)-(11).

In [7] was suggested a more sophisticated dielectric

function by considering the relaxation ansatz

instead of the global distribution f0(~v) in (12). In the
simplest case one can specify the local distribution by a
small ﬂuctuation in the chemical potential δµ related to
the density-ﬂuctuation δn.

The Mermin-dielectric function is derived by solving
(18) using an expansion of the local equilibrium distribu-
tion function in powers of δµ

˜f0(~q, ~v, ω) = f0(~v)

C. Comparison of both dielectric function

Up to now we have used diﬀerent kinetic equations
leading to two diﬀerent dielectric functions. It is of great
interest how these functions are related to each other and
whether these dielectric functions are valid in the storage
ring plasma’s realm of temperature, density and friction
coeﬃcient. In Fig.1 and Fig. 2 are plotted both dielectric
functions in dependence on the frequency for several wave
numbers and temperatures.

We see that within the numerical accuracy of the pic-
ture no diﬀerence is visible between the dielectric func-
tion of a Fokker Planck collision integral and the Mermin
dielectric function resulting from the conserving relax-
ation time approximation.

Let us inspect now some special limits. Both dielectric

function fulﬁlls the static limit (ω

strong friction limits are identical.

For low temperatures there are diﬀerences between the
RPA-dielectric function and the other correlated dielec-
tric functions. The real parts start in the static limit at
the same value as the RPA-dielectric function but drops
down much more earlier (in Fig.1 one sees 4 magnitudes
at one tenth of the inverse Debye length and 2 magni-
tudes at ten times the inverse Debye length). There are
no zeros in the real part. Accordingly, the imaginary
part is shifted in the same fashion. It is one magnitude
broader than the RPA imaginary part and has only two
thirds of its height. For temperatures higher than 50K
the RPA-dielectric function and the Mermin- and VFP
dielectric functions become identical.

D. Sum rules

The most interesting question is whether the dielectric
function fulﬁlls the sum rules (8)-(11). Due to (29) all
ω−2 for
presented dielectric functions lead to Reǫ(~q, ω)
large ω. Since poles due to the relaxation time occur only
in the lower half plane we have

From (31) we get with (28) in the static limit just the
compressibility sum rule (10). The longitudinal f-sum
rule (8) follows as well from (31). To see this we observe

Using (29) we obtain just the f-sum rule (8).

Since the same Kramers-Kronig relation (31) holds also
for ǫ instead of ǫ−1 we see that the corresponding free sum
rules (9) and (11) are also fulﬁlled.

This completes the proof that both correlated dielec-
tric functions fulﬁll the sum rules. We can state therefore
that the dielectric function is properly valid in the inter-
esting scope and can be used to describe the phenom-
ena in cold and dilute storage ring plasmas. Since the
Mermin dielectric function is computational much easier
to handle, in fact no more circumstances than the Lind-
hard dielectric function, we will use the Mermin dielectric
function further on.

III. APPLICATION TO STORAGE RING
PLASMAS

We continue now to apply the correlated dielectric
function derived in the last paragraph to typical storage
ring plasmas. Two important quantities we like to dis-
cuss here. First the stopping power of ions in an electron
plasma and second the occurring plasmon excitations.

A. Stopping power

The stopping power, i.e. the energy transfer of a parti-
cle to a plasma is given in terms of the dielectric function
by [9]

Here nb denotes the Bose function and Vaa the Coulomb
potential of the particle a. We observe that the sum

5

about diﬀerent plasma species is condensed in the dielec-
tric function. It is noteworthy to remark that this result
is valid for any arbitrary degeneracy. The derivation pre-
sented in [9] shows that the result (33) is more general
valid than derived earlier [10–12]. Higher order correla-
tions like vertex corrections can be incorporated in the
dielectric function, such that (33) remains valid [9]. This
fact is important for dense solid state plasmas which are
used recently for stopping experiments, where the result
(33) is applicable as well. A more explicit form can be
given by carrying out the angular integration [q = ¯hk]

among them the well known Bethe formula. We use (34)
where no artiﬁcial cut-oﬀ is needed further on.

In ﬁgure 3 we have plotted the stopping power of 9Be+
calculated with the Mermin and the Lindhard dielectric
function. We observe that for a weakly coupled stor-
age ring plasma with temperature of 6 K and a den-
sity of 2.3 1013m−3 which corresponds to a nonideality
of Γ = 0.13 almost no diﬀerences are observed between
the Mermin and Lindhard result. For higher coupling by
lower temperature of 1 K corresponding to Γ = 0.77 we
see that the Mermin stopping power become smaller than
the Lindhard result. Since the friction is dependent on
the squared of density but only on temperature via the
Coulomb logarithm we ﬁnd a stronger dependence on the
density. This is illustrated in the ﬁgures 3-5. We see that
with increasing density the deviations between Mermin
and Lindhard results become appreciable.

with charge Z = 1. In ﬁgures 3 - 5 we compare the re-
sults for the dielectric theory of stopping power with and
without collisional contributions with the pure two- par-
ticle collision result of (36). We see that the two-particle
collision expression is signiﬁcantly smaller than the di-
electric theory. For very strong coupling in ﬁgure 6 we
see even a vanishing contribution of the latter one indi-
cating that the two-particle collisions do not contribute
any more but the energy transfer is mainly caused by
collective spreading. In Fig.7 we represent the reduced
energy loss [λl = e2/(12πǫ0T )]

So far we have generalized the dielectric theory of stop-

to compare now the results directly with the stopping
power in binary collision approximation. In [9] the follow-
ing expression for the stopping power was derived from
the Boltzmann equation within T-matrix approximation

The dependence of the normalized energy loss from the
coupling parameter is weaker in the Mermin case than in
the RPA case but distinct from the numerical simula-
tions. Nevertheless the involving of collisions modiﬁes
the stopping power in the right direction. The best de-
scription is still given by the T-matrix result (36).

as plasma waves propagating in two directions around

rent shows the propagating waves clearly as peaks in the
spectra which are theoretically well described in [3,8].

use now to compute the the Schottky noise much easier

IV. SUMMARY

In this paper we have described two dielectric func-
tions including collisions. After numerical inspection we
have shown that the DF obtained from VFP equation
is identical with the Mermin DF. Modifying the dielec-
tric function for storage ring purposes (modiﬁed plasma
frequency, discrete wavenumbers/harmonics) we have de-
rived the standard dielectric function for Schottky noise
prediction for a three dimensional plasma beam. Because
of the identity of both dielectric functions one can use
a Mermin dielectric function for Schottky noise descrip-
tion, too. The second goal was a better description of
the stopping power acting on an ion beam in the cooler’s
electron gas. Here we like to state, that including the
collisions leads to a lower friction force than in the RPA-
predictions but obvious overestimates the friction force
compared with simulated and experimental results.

Further improvement has to be done to consider strong
coupling eﬀects in the relaxation time by using a match-
ing Coulomb logarithm. Eﬀorts have also to be done
to include the magnetic ﬁeld in the cooler and the
anisotropic Maxwell distributions in the dielectric func-
tion.

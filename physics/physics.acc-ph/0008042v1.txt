Abstract

A technique for production of an electron beam with a high
transverse emittance ratio, a “ﬂat” beam, has been proposed
by Brinkmann, Derbenev, and Fl¨ottmann.[1] The cathode
of an RF-laser gun is immersed in a solenoidal magnetic
ﬁeld; as a result the beam emitted from a round laser spot
has a net angular momentum. Subsequent passage through
a matched quadrupole channel that has a 90 degree differ-
ence in phase advance between the transverse degrees of
freedom results in a ﬂat beam. Experimental study is un-
derway at the Fermilab Photoinjector. Thus far, transverse
emittance ratios as high as 50 have been observed, and the
results are in substantial agreement with simulation.

1

INTRODUCTION

Two years ago, Ya. Derbenev invented an optics maneu-
ver for transforming a beam with a high ratio of horizontal
to vertical emittance—a “ﬂat beam” —to one with equal
emittances in the transverse degrees-of-freedom—a “round
beam”.[2] High energy electron cooling at the TeV energy
scale was the motivation.

Last year, R. Brinkmann and K. Fl¨ottmann of DESY
joined with Derbenev in a paper that reverses the process—
obtain a ﬂat beam from a round beam produced from the
cathode of an electron gun.[1] This could be a signiﬁcant
step toward the elimination or simpliﬁcation of the electron
damping ring in a linear collider design. The other major
step in that process is the delivery of polarized electrons
in the ﬂat beam, and this is an R&D challenge beyond the
scope of the work reported here.

The intent of the present experiment was to demonstrate
the round-to-ﬂat transformation, compare the results with
simulation, and verify that the demonstration was not ob-
scured by other processes. In the following sections, we
present a simpliﬁed version of the transformation, describe
the experimental setup, present the results, and comment
on future plans.

2 PRINCIPLE

Suppose that the cathode of an electron gun is immersed in
a uniform solenoidal ﬁeld of magnitude Bz. For the sake of
this argument, assume that the thermal emittance is negli-
gible and ignore RF focusing in the gun. Then the particles
just stream along the ﬁeld lines until the end of the solenoid

tract with the US Department of Energy

is reached, at which point the beam acquires an angular mo-
mentum. A particle with initial transverse coordinates x0,
y0 acquires angular deﬂections. With momentum p0 at the
solenoid end, the state of the particle becomes

Next pass the beam through an alternating gradient
quadrupole channel. Assume that the channel is repre-
sented by an identity matrix in the x-direction and has an
additional 900 phase advance in y.

We get the output state

In the last step above, with β = 1/k, the particles end up
with equal displacements in x and y and travelling at equal
angles in x and y. This describes a ﬂat beam inclined at
an angle of 450 to the coordinate axes. Change to a skew-
quadrupole channel, and the ﬂat beam can be aligned along
either the horizontal or vertical axis.

This idealized example is only meant to illustrate the
principle. The essential points about the quadrupole chan-
nel are the π/2 difference in phase advance between
the transverse degrees-of-freedom, and the match of the
Courant-Snyder parameters.[3] This may be accomplished
with as few as three quadrupoles. Of course, in practice,
RF focusing ﬁelds in the gun and in a booster cavity, space
charge, and so on cannot be ignored.

With the inclusion of thermal emittance, Brinkmann,
Derbenev, and Fl¨ottmann[1] speak of an achievable emit-
tance ratio of order 102 or more for a beam with normal-
ized emittance √ǫx · ǫy ≈ 1µm per nC of bunch charge.

where now in the deﬁnition of k, Bz remains the ﬁeld
on the cathode, but p0 is the momentum at entry to the
quadrupole channel, and σc, σ′
c are the standard deviations
of the distribution in displacement and angle at the cath-
ode. The resulting vertical emittance would be 0.1 µm,
in the range of interest for a linear collider. Liouville’s
Theorem remains in effect for the 4-dimensional transverse
emittance, but the angular momentum provides the lever
by which emittance may be moved from one degree-of-
freedom to another.

3 THE FERMILAB PHOTOINJECTOR

ENVIRONMENT

The photoinjector at Fermilab is well suited to this sort
of experiment. The RF gun delivers electrons with a ki-
netic energy of (typically) 3.8 MeV. The superconducting
booster cavity raises the electron energy to 17 MeV.

The solenoid is composed of three separately excited
coils permitting ﬁelds at the cathode in the range 0 to
2.7 kG. The coil immediately upstream of the cathode, the
“bucker”, is normally excited with current opposite to that
of the next coil, the “primary” to produce zero ﬁeld at the
cathode. Downstream, the combination yields solenoidal
focusing, which can be adjusted with the third coil, the
“secondary”. The secondary has little effect on the ﬁeld
on the cathode.

Following the booster cavity, about 8 meters of beamline
are available for experiments. There are 11 quadrupoles
that are easily moved about or rotated into the skew orien-
tation. A dozen view screens are situated on the line, and
there are three locations where slits are installed for emit-
tance measurement. The laser can operate at a variety of
pulse lengths up to 12 ps, the setting that we used. Bunch
charge as high as 10 nC is available. We operated at no
higher than 1 nC in order to reduce space charge effects as
much as possible. The layout as related to this experiment
is sketched in Fig. 1.

4 PROCEDURE

The solenoid coils were set to produce a ﬁeld at the cathode
in the expected range, about 0.75 kG. Using the language of
the preceding section, this meant setting the bucker to zero
current and controlling the cathode ﬁeld with the primary.
The beam was observed at the location of the two screens

immediately downstream of the booster cavity, and by ad-
justment of the secondary coil, the beam spot was made the
same size at these two places. In other words, a beam waist
was produced. At this stage, the beam has a round shape
on the screens.

The simple argument of Sec. 2 is no longer valid for de-
termination of the β for the match, because the solenoid
ﬁeld is not uniform and the RF focusing and acceleration
must be taken into account. Making use of linearity, axial
symmetry, and the conservation of canonical angular mo-
mentum between the cathode and the waist yields for the
value of β at entry to the quadrupole channel

β =

σ2
w
σ2
c

2(pw/e)

Bc

where the subscripts c and w refer to the cathode and waist
respectively and the σ’s characterize the radii of the beam
spots. The other Courant-Snyder parameter involved in the
match, α, is zero due to the choice of a waist as the match
point.

Given preliminary values for the matching parameters,
an (asymmetric) skew triplet was set up. Flat beam pro-
ﬁles were rather easily achieved by adjustment of available
tuning parameters, including the launch phase from the RF
gun. The latter proved to be particularly important, a cir-
cumstance that is yet to be explained.

5 RESULTS

The transformation should work — it’s linear dynamics —
and it does. The match and phase difference were achieved
with three skew quadrupoles. The beam image on an OTR
screen 1.2 m downstream of the third quadrupole is shown
in Fig. 2; the beam width is an order of magnitude larger
than the height. A critical observation is that the beam re-
main ﬂat as it drifts farther downstream. That it does is
demonstrated in Fig. 3 near the end of the beamline at 3.6 m
from the third quadrupole.

In Fig. 2 there is a hint of an s-shape, which likely in-
dicates that spherical aberrations (e.g. space charge) are
at work. If the solenoid ﬁeld on the cathode is varied up
or down from the matched condition the beam apparently
rotates clockwise or counterclockwise as it drifts, indicat-
ing that the angular momentum is no longer completely
cancelled. Of course, it isn’t a real rotation — there’s no
torque— it’s a shear.

tion of the focusing characteristics of this device was re-
quired. In the Chambers approximation[6], its demagni-
ﬁcation is a factor of 5, so its treatment is sensitive to a
number of factors, e.g.
the exact ﬁeld proﬁle. It will be
worthwhile to measure the transfer matrix through the cav-
ity experimentally.

6 CONCLUSIONS

The round-to-ﬂat transformation has been veriﬁed, with a
demonstrated emittance ratio of a factor of 50 between the
two transverse degrees-of-freedom. Further work will be
needed to restore the emittance compensation necessary to
the delivery of low transverse emittance, and that is the sub-
ject of a follow-on experiment, in the direction suggested
by Brinkmann, Debenev and Fl¨ottmann in their EPAC2000
paper.[7] The predictive capability of the simulations is en-
couraging thus far, and the results reported here indicate
directions for improvement.

In these ﬁgures, the beam is ﬂat in the horizontal plane.
The OTR screens are viewed from the side, and so a beam
that is ﬂat horizontally presents a depth of ﬁeld problem
for best emittance analysis. So in later stages of the ex-
periment, the beam was made ﬂat in the vertical plane.
From slit data in this orientation, the measured ratio of
emittances is about 50: ǫx ≈ 0.9µm, ǫy ≈ 45µm, with
the one degree-of-freedom normalized emittance deﬁned
by ǫ2 = γ 2(v/c)2(hx2ihx′2i − hxx′i2). We feel that this
is a good result for an initial experiment. The horizontal
emittance measurement is resolution limited, as illustrated
in Fig. 4 wherein a sequence of slit images is superimposed
in order to form a distribution. The standard deviation of
the narrow distribution is comparable to a single pixel of
the CCD camera viewing the screen.

The product of the emittances is higher than that usual
in operation with round beams; typically, the emittance
in each transverse degree-of-freedom is about 3 to 4 µm.
However, there is no reason to believe that the emittance
compensation normally in use would be effective under the
conditions of this experiment.

The simulations[4],[5] carried out prior to the measure-
ments provided useful guidance, but were not perfect. The
prediction of spot size just downstream of the gun worked
ﬁne. But to achieve the match to the quadrupoles, the
solenoid required adjustment.

In order to obtain agreement between the location of the
beam waist downstream of the booster cavity, a modiﬁca-

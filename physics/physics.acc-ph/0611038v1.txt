MUON COOLING AND FUTURE MUON FACILITIES∗

Muon colliders and neutrino factories are attractive options for achieving the highest lepton-
antilepton collision energies and the most precise measurements of the parameters of the neutrino
mixing matrix. The performance and cost of these future facilities depends sensitively on how well
a beam of muons can be cooled. The recent progress of muon-cooling prototype tests and design
studies nourishes the hope that such facilities can be built during the next decade.

Keywords: collider; cooling; muon; neutrino; factory.

1. Introduction

The muon oﬀers important advantages over
the electron for use in a high-energy collider:

(1) The 1/m2 suppression of radiative pro-
cesses enables the use of storage rings
and recirculating accelerators, reducing
the size (Fig. 1) and cost of the complex.
(2) In the Standard Model and many exten-
sions, the muon/electron cross-section
ratio for s-channel annihilation to Higgs
bosons is (mµ/me)2 = 4.3 × 104, giving
the muon collider a unique window on
electroweak symmetry breaking.1,2
(3) “Beamstrahlung” interactions, which
limit e+e−-collider luminosity as energy
increases,3 are negligible for muons.

Moreover, a muon storage ring is an ideal
source for long-baseline neutrino-oscillation
experiments: via µ− → e−νµνe and µ+ →
e+ν µνe,
it can provide collimated, high-
energy neutrino beams with well-understood
composition and properties.4 The very clean
identiﬁcation of ﬁnal-state muons in far de-
tectors enables low-background appearance
measurements using νe and νe beams. The
separation of oscillated from non-oscillated

events requires only that the detector be
magnetized so as to distinguish µ+ (the oscil-
lated events if µ− are stored in the ring) from
µ− (the oscillated events if µ+ are stored).

These advantages come with clear disad-
vantages: the short muon lifetime and large
beam size require development of new, rapid
beam manipulation and acceleration tech-
niques if intense muon beams are to be ac-
celerated, stored, or collided. Stored-muon

which allows smaller-aperture (hence less
costly) accelerators and higher luminosity.

where β is the muon velocity in units of

mass in GeV/c2, β⊥ the lattice betatron

the medium. A portion of this cooling ef-
fect can be transferred to the longitudinal
phase plane by placing suitably shaped ab-
sorbers in dispersive regions of the lattice
(“emittance exchange”)8,9,10 or using path-
length-dependent energy loss within a homo-
geneous absorber.11 (Longitudinal ionization
cooling per se is impractical due to energy-
loss straggling.10)

The terms of Eq. 1 represent muon cool-

cept with √s = 5 TeV: a helical cooling channel17
(HCC) cools the µ+ and µ− beams in all six dimen-
sions suﬃciently that they can then be accelerated
in an RLA based on ILC-style rf-cavity modules.

pions created by beam from high-intensity “proton
driver” are captured and decay in a focusing channel;
decay muons undergo phase-space manipulations, in-
cluding transverse ionization cooling; are accelerated
in a linac, a “dogbone” recirculating linac (RLA),
and two ﬁxed-ﬁeld alternating-gradient (FFAG) ac-
celerators; and are stored in two racetrack-shaped
decay rings whose long straight sections each form
oppositely directed neutrino and antineutrino beams
aimed at near and far detectors.

2. Muon Cooling

Standard (electron, stochastic, and laser)
beam-cooling methods are far too slow to
be eﬀective within the 2.2 µs muon lifetime.
However, the muon’s penetrating character
enables rapid muon cooling via ionization.7,8
An ionization-cooling channel comprises en-
ergy absorbers and radio-frequency (rf) ac-
celerating cavities placed within a focusing
magnetic lattice. In the absorbers the muons
lose energy by ionization; the rf cavities
restore energy only along the beam axis.
In this way, the (initially highly divergent)
muon beam can be made more parallel.

Cooling is best understood in terms of
normalized beam emittance ǫn, the volume
of a beam in phase space, which is a constant
of the motion both in linear beam transport
and during acceleration. Cooling is the pro-
cess of reducing a beam’s normalized emit-

ing by energy loss and heating by multiple
Coulomb scattering. Setting the two terms
equal gives the equilibrium emittance ǫn,eq,
at which the cooling rate is zero and beyond
which a given lattice cannot cool. Since the
heating term scales with β⊥, a low ǫn,eq re-
quires low β⊥ (i.e., high focusing strength)
at the absorbers. Most design studies have
used superconducting solenoids, which can
give β⊥ ∼ 10 cm, as the focusing element
of choice. Concerning LR, low-Z absorber
media are favored, the best being hydrogen
(approximately twice as eﬀective for cooling
as helium, the next best material12).

It is the absorbers that cool the beam,
but for typical “real-estate” accelerating
gradients (≈ 10 MeV/m,
to be compared
with hdEµ/dsi ≈ 30 MeV/m for liquid
hydrogen13), the rf cavities dominate the
length of the cooling channel (see e.g. Fig. 4).
Ideally, the acceleration should exceed the
minimum required for energy replacement,
allowing “oﬀ-crest” operation. This gives
continual rebunching, so that a beam with
large momentum spread remains captured in
the rf bucket. The achievable rf gradient
thus determines how much cooling is prac-
tical before an appreciable fraction of the
muons have decayed or drifted out of the
bucket. High-gradient rf cavities (normal-
conducting due to the magnetic ﬁeld in which
they must operate) for muon cooling are un-
der development,14 as is an alternative cool-
ing approach: cavities pressurized with hy-
drogen gas, thus combining energy absorp-
tion and reacceleration.15 In the ﬁrst cooling
stages the large size of the uncooled beam re-
quires relatively low rf frequency. Goals are
>
∼ 15 MeV/m at ≈ 201 MHz in ≈ 2 T ﬁelds.

In the cooling term of Eq. 1, the per-
centage decrease in normalized emittance is
proportional to the percentage energy loss,
thus (approximating β ≈ 1) cooling in one
transverse dimension by a factor 1/e requires
∼ 100% energy loss and replacement. De-
spite the relativistic increase of muon life-

time with energy, ionization cooling favors
low beam momentum because of the increase
of dE/ds for momenta below the ionization
minimum,13 the greater ease of beam fo-
cusing, and the lower accelerating voltage
required. Most muon-cooling designs have
used momenta in the range 150−400 MeV/c.
This is also the momentum range in which
the pion-production cross section from thick
targets tends to peak and is thus optimal
for muon production as well as cooling. The
cooling channel of Fig. 4 is optimized for a
mean muon momentum of 200 MeV/c.

Cooling

multaneously in all six dimensions are re-
ceiving increasing attention,16,17 from both
the Neutrino Factory and Muon Collider
Collaboration18 and Muons, Inc.19 These are
essential to a high-luminosity muon collider
and may enable higher-performance or lower-
cost neutrino factories. As Fig. 3 suggests,
muon colliders oﬀer the prospect of much
higher collision energies than are feasible

with electrons; they thus provide a potential
next step beyond the ILC.

4. Technology Demonstrations

The R&D on muon cooling20 has identiﬁed
a number of technologies crucial to future
muon facilities, each of which has a demon-
stration experiment proposed or in progress:

(1) The MERIT (Mercury Intense Target)
experiment, approved at CERN and un-
der construction for operation in 2007;
the goal
is to show feasibility of a
mercury-jet target for a 4 MW proton
beam with solenoidal pion capture.21
(2) MICE (the Muon Ionization Cooling
Experiment, see Fig. 4), approved at
Rutherford Appleton Laboratory and
under construction, aiming to verify the
feasibility and performance of transverse
ionization cooling by 2010.22

(3) EMMA (Electron Model of Muon Accel-
erator), proposal to build and operate
at Daresbury Laboratory a model “non-
scaling” FFAG accelerator.23

(4) MANX (Muon collider And Neutrino
factory eXperiment), LoI to build and
test a helical cooling channel segment.19

Experimental results may soon strengthen
the physics case for a muon facility. With the
key techniques established by ≈2010, a facil-
ity could then be built in the ensuing decade.

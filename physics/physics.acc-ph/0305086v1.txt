Abstract

Beam-beam simulations predict that PEP-II luminosity can be increased by operating the
horizontal betatron tune near and above a half-integer resonance. However, effects of the
resonance and its synchrotron sidebands signiﬁcantly enhance betatron and chromatic pertur-
bations which tend to reduce dynamic aperture. In the study, chromatic variation of horizon-
tal tune near the resonance was minimized by optimizing local sextupoles in the Interaction
Region. Dynamic aperture was calculated using tracking simulations in LEGO code. Depen-
dence of dynamic aperture on the residual orbit, dispersion and β distortion after correction
was investigated.

TRACKING SIMULATIONS NEAR
HALF-INTEGER RESONANCE AT PEP-II †

Y. Cai, Y. Nosochkov, SLAC, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA

Abstract

Beam-beam simulations predict that PEP-II luminosity
can be increased by operating the horizontal betatron tune
near and above a half-integer resonance. However, effects
of the resonance and its synchrotron sidebands signiﬁcantly
enhance betatron and chromatic perturbations which tend
to reduce dynamic aperture. In the study, chromatic varia-
tion of horizontal tune near the resonance was minimized
by optimizing local sextupoles in the Interaction Region.
Dynamic aperture was calculated using tracking simula-
tions in LEGO code. Dependence of dynamic aperture on
the residual orbit, dispersion and β distortion after correc-
tion was investigated.

INTRODUCTION

PEP-II [1] has been operating at the betatron tune νx/νy
close to 24.569/23.639 in the High Energy Ring (HER)
and 38.649/36.564 in the Low Energy Ring (LER). These
working points were selected experimentally for a reliable
machine performance, good luminosity and beam lifetime.
However, the beam-beam simulations predict that luminos-
ity can be increased by operating betatron tune very close
and above the half-integer resonance. Fig. 1 shows the LER
tune diagram with synchro-betatron resonances up to the
4th order and a contour plot of the single bunch luminosity.
Calculation of luminosity was done using the beam-beam
code developed at SLAC [2] which has been recently up-
graded to the three dimensional version.

The difﬁculty of operating close to half-integer reso-
nance comes from enhancement of the resonance effects
on betatron motion. It is well known that perturbation of β
function created by focusing errors depends on tune ν as

where µ is phase advance, φ(s, l) = πν − |µ(s)−µ(l)|,
and ∆K1 is a focusing error created mainly by quadrupole
ﬁeld imperfections, horizontal orbit at sextupoles, and mo-
mentum error. Close to half-integer resonance, growth of
∆β/β comes from the resonance term [sin 2πν]−1 which
behaves as 1/∆ν when distance to the resonance is as small
as ∆ν ≪ 1/2π. On the other hand, orbit and dispersion are
not excited by the half-integer resonance.

For signiﬁcant enhancement of luminosity, fractional
value of horizontal tune should be in the range of [νx] ≈ .51.
At this working point, enhancement of ∆βx/βx in HER
and LER due to the resonance term in Eqn. 1 would be a

factor of 6.7 and 12.8, respectively, compared to the present
tune. Without compensation, the large β growth may sig-
niﬁcantly increase amplitude dependent non-linear aberra-
tions and reduce dynamic aperture and beam lifetime.

More resonance effects are generated by the synchrotron
sidebands of the half-integer resonance: 2νx + mνs = n,
where νs is a synchrotron tune, and m, n are integers. In the
LER, where νs = 0.025, the 1st and 2nd synchro-betatron
resonances occur at [νx] = .5125 and .525, while in HER
with νs = 0.045 the 1st sideband is at [νx] = .5225. Track-
ing simulations will show that the sidebands have a strong
effect on dynamic aperture, therefore working tune should
be chosen reasonably far from them. In addition, variation
of tune with synchrotron momentum oscillations should be
minimized to avoid crossing with these resonances.

Optimization of PEP-II lattice near half-integer reso-
nance and analysis of dynamic aperture are discussed be-
low. The optics with β∗
y = 50/1.25 cm at the Interaction
Point (IP) is used.

LATTICE OPTIMIZATION

PEP-II has two tuning sections which can be locally ad-
justed to change betatron tune without affecting the rest of
machine optics. Initially, only these sections were modi-
ﬁed to move the horizontal tune closer to half-integer, and
vertical tune to [νy] ≈ .61 as suggested by beam-beam anal-
ysis. But tracking simulations showed that dynamic aper-
ture was not sufﬁciently large with machine errors and syn-
chrotron momentum oscillations of up to ±8σp, where σp
is the rms value of relative momentum spread ∆p
p in the
beam. Analysis of chromaticity indicated that non-linear
variation of horizontal tune with momentum needs to be

further reduced to avoid crossing with the synchro-betatron
resonances.

In PEP-II, the most contribution to non-linear chromatic-
ity is generated in the ﬁnal quadrupole doublets near IP.
This chromaticity is compensated by the Interaction Re-
gion (IR) sextupoles located in the same phase with the
doublets. Variation of strength of these sextupoles allows
to compensate quadratic dependence of tune on ∆p
p , and a
small adjustment of sextupole phase advance helps reduce
the higher order variation.

Minimum of the second order chromaticity was achieved
by reducing strengths of the IR sextupoles correcting hori-
zontal chromaticity. Further improvement in LER resulted
from reduction of horizontal phase advance between the
IR horizontal sextupoles and IP by 5◦. For correction of
the machine linear chromaticity, strength of the global sex-
tupoles was increased to compensate for the weaker IR sex-
tupoles. Because the adjusted IR sextupoles in LER have a
non-zero design orbit, the reduced sextupole strength cre-
ated a feed-down effect of linear focusing and coupling.
This small perturbation was compensated by a slight ad-
justment of the IR magnet strengths.

The optimized horizontal tune for momentum range of
∆p
p < 10σp is shown in Fig. 2, 3, where

the working point is νx/νy = 24.51/23.61 in HER and
38.518/36.61 in LER. The straight dash lines depict the
half-integer synchrotron sidebands. In HER, a positive lin-
ear chromaticity ξ = +1 was used in Fig. 2 to counteract
the negative slope of non-linear tune variation. Due to the
large synchrotron tune, it was possible to place the HER
working point below the 1st synchrotron sideband without
crossing with the resonance lines. In the LER, synchrotron
tune is a factor of 2 smaller while energy spread is 25%
larger, therefore the closest to half-integer working point
was chosen between the 1st and 2nd sidebands.

νx at νy = 36.61. Synchrotron sidebands: 1) 2νx −νs = 77,
2) 2νx −2νs = 77, 3) 2νx −3νs = 77.

DYNAMIC APERTURE SIMULATIONS

Calculations of dynamic aperture were performed using
tracking simulations in LEGO code [3]. First, dependence
of aperture on betatron tune near half-integer resonance
was investigated for lattice without magnet errors, but with
synchrotron momentum oscillations of ±8σp. The resul-
tant horizontal tune scan is shown in Fig. 4, 5 for HER and
LER, where dynamic aperture is normalized by the rms size
of a fully coupled beam.

The HER horizontal dynamic aperture vanishes in the
vicinity of the main half-integer resonance 2νx = 49 and
its 1st sideband. In LER, the strongly affecting resonances
are 2νx +mνs = 77 with m = 0, −1, −2, −3. Naturally, the
working tune should be chosen reasonably far from these
resonances. The following scenarios for more and less ag-
gressive horizontal tune νx near half-integer were investi-
gated in the simulations:

LER: 38.518.
LER: 38.529.

1. HER: 24.51,
2. HER: 24.529,
Dynamic aperture scan versus vertical tune was per-
formed for the ﬁrst scenario of νx and the range of [νy]
from .55 to .64. It showed that dynamic aperture gradu-
ally reduces as [νy] becomes closer to [νx] and the working
point approaches the crossing of half-integer and coupling
resonances. Based on this scan, the vertical fractional tune
of [νy] = .61 was chosen for these simulations. A lower νy
may be considered for further luminosity enhancement.

Secondly, tracking simulations with ﬁeld errors, mis-
alignment and ∆p
p = ±8σp synchrotron momentum os-
cillations were performed for the selected working points.
For statistics, ten different settings (“seeds”) of random
machine errors were used in each tracking. Perturbation
of beam orbit, linear chromaticity, betatron tune and ver-
tical dispersion was compensated using realistic correc-
tion schemes in LEGO. Since distortion of β function be-
comes more sensitive to focusing errors near half-integer
resonance, a special correction of ∆β
β was implemented in
LEGO. It uses MICADO method to ﬁnd the most effective
quadrupoles to minimize β perturbation.

Due to the greater effect of errors near half-integer res-
onance, a better machine correction is needed to maintain
acceptable dynamic aperture. To verify tolerance to vari-
ous errors, simulations were performed for different levels
of machine correction.
It has been conﬁrmed that beam
orbit should be decreased for an acceptable dynamic aper-
ture. The better orbit correction reduces the feed-down fo-
cusing errors in sextupoles as well as residual dispersion in
the machine. On the other hand, correction of vertical dis-
persion did not signiﬁcantly affect dynamic aperture in the
observed range of residual rms ∆ηy from ∼70 to 5 mm.

As expected, the simulations conﬁrmed that compensa-
tion of ∆β/β is required in the ﬁrst scenario, where νx is
closer to the resonance. Typically, ∆β/β was corrected
to the rms level of < 5%.
In the second scenario, at
[νx] = .529, correction of β function was less important, al-
though it helped to improve cases with small aperture. Ta-
ble 1 summarizes the observed approximate levels of rms
orbit and ∆βx/βx for acceptable dynamic aperture.

The resultant dynamic aperture in HER at νx/νy =
24.51/23.61 for a good level of correction is shown in
Fig. 6 at the injection point. Stable particle motion corre-
sponds to the area inside the dash lines which represent 10
different seeds of random machine errors. The solid half-
ellipse, shown for reference, is the 10σ size of a fully cou-
pled beam at injection with emittance ǫx = 48 nm and ǫy =
ǫx/2. In this simulation, the residual rms orbit, dispersion
and β distortions after correction were: 0.27/0.31 mm,
∆η = 31/8 mm and ∆β/β = 1.9/1.5% in x/y planes, re-
spectively. Linear chromaticity was set to +1 to minimize
non-linear tune variation with momentum.

The LER dynamic aperture at νx/νy = 38.518/36.61
is shown in Fig. 7 at the injection point. The solid half-
ellipse corresponds to 10σ size of a fully coupled beam at
injection with emittance ǫx = 24 nm. The residual rms
orbit, dispersion and β distortions after correction were:
0.20/0.23 mm, ∆η = 23/9 mm and ∆β/β = 2.4/2.5%
in x/y planes, respectively. Linear chromaticity was set to

zero in this case.

Implementation of the tune near half-integer resonance
has been recently performed at PEP-II. The working point
was successfully moved to νx/νy = 24.52/23.63 in HER
and 38.52/36.57 in LER. After the necessary machine ad-
justments luminosity has been improved by ∼15% to the
new record of 6.1·1033 cm−2s−1.

CONCLUSION

Beam-beam simulations performed for PEP-II predicted
an enhancement of luminosity for a betatron tune near a
half-integer resonance. Horizontal fractional tune of .52
has been recently implemented at PEP-II and ∼15% lu-
minosity gain has been achieved. Particle tracking sim-
ulations showed that an improved machine correction is
needed for acceptable dynamic aperture at [νx] = .51 in
HER and .518 in LER. This requires a minimization of
non-linear chromaticity and tighter correction of orbit and
βx distortions. At [νx] = .529, a looser orbit correction may
be used while compensation of ∆βx may not be necessary.

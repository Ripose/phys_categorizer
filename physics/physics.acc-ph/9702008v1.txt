Two-particle correlation functions for positive and neg-
ative pions have been measured in Au+Au collisions at
10.8 GeV/c per nucleon. The data were analyzed using one-
and three-dimensional correlation functions. From the results
of the three-dimensional ﬁt the phase space density of pions
was calculated.
It is consistent with local thermal equilib-
rium.

−

Bose-Einstein correlations of identical pions can be
used to obtain information about
the space-time-
momentum distribution S(r, t, p) of pions at freeze-out
(pion source) in a nuclear collision (for a review see
[1]). The two-pion correlation function C(p1, p2), de-
ﬁned as the ratio between the two-particle density and
the product of single particle densities, shows a peak at
p1 = 0. The width of this peak is inversely
q = p2
proportional to the size of the pion source. Analysis
of C as a function of diﬀerent components of the rela-
tive momentum yields information about the source di-
mensions in diﬀerent directions. The relation between
S and C is, under realistic conditions, complicated by
eﬀects like three- (and more) particle correlations [2–4],
long-lived resonance decays [5–7], and the distortion of
the single-particle spectra by the two-particle correla-
tions [8,9]. The correlation must also be corrected for
the Coulomb interaction between the two pions [10–12].
In this Letter we present results of the correlation
analysis of pions produced in central Au+Au collisions
at 10.8 GeV/c per nucleon. The data were taken in
Fall 1993 at the AGS. The central trigger at the level
of 10% of the geometrical cross section was used. The
apparatus allowed a simultaneous measurement of posi-
tive and negative pions with a momentum resolution of
∆p/p
3%. With two ﬁeld polarities used, the overall
acceptances for positive and negative pion pairs were sim-

sists of one million central events and the total number of
analyzed π+π+, π−π−, and π+π− pairs is 130 k, 210 k,
and 340 k, respectively. The particle identiﬁcation (PID)
quality was tested by varying the PID cuts in order to
deliberately accept background particles. No signiﬁcant
inﬂuence on the results was observed implying that par-
ticle misidentiﬁcation does not contribute signiﬁcantly to
the overall systematic uncertainty. A more detailed de-
scription of the experiment and of the data analysis can
be found in [13].

Experimentally, the correlation function C(q) is de-
ﬁned as the number of pion pairs in a q-bin (signal) di-
vided by the number of such pairs obtained by event
mixing (background). The variables qout, qside, and qlong,
used in the three-dimensional ‘out-side-long’ analysis,
are the components of q in the beam rapidity frame
yanal = ybeam = 3.14. Here qlong is the component par-
allel to the beam, qside is perpendicular to the beam and
to the average pair momentum, and qout is perpendic-
ular to qlong and qside [14,15].
In our one-dimensional
analysis we analyzed two-pion correlations as a func-
tion of q =
frame. For
equal mass particles q is equal to Qinv which is deﬁned

The background pairs were weighted with the Coulomb

the asymptotic momentum of a pion in the pair c.m.s.
(k = Qinv/2), and r is the relative distance of the two
pions at freeze-out. The relative velocity enters through
η = Z1Z2mπcα/Qinv where mπ is the pion mass and α
is the ﬁne structure constant. For pions emitted from a
point-like source F is equal to unity and the Coulomb
correction becomes the well known Gamow factor [10,16]
(dot-dashed line in Fig. 1). For a ﬁnite size source, the
Coulomb correction factor can be obtained numerically
by averaging H(k, r) over r. The correction H calculated
this way for a Gaussian source with σx = σy = σz =
5 fm and σt = 0 is shown as a dashed curve in Fig. 1.
In addition, since it would be incorrect to divide data
which have been measured with a ﬁnite resolution ∆p
by a correction calculated assuming ∆p=0, we folded H
with the momentum resolution of the spectrometer. The
resulting correction H∆p is shown as a solid line in Fig. 1.

tion assuming a point-like pion source (Gamow factor). The
dashed line H was calculated for a Gaussian source with a
realistic size. The same curve folded with the spectrometer
momentum resolution is shown as a solid line. This is the
correction used in the data analysis.

Since the π+π− correlation is dominated by the mutual
Coulomb interaction, we can use it to test the quality of
the Coulomb correction. This correlation function, un-
corrected, corrected by the Gamow, and by H∆p is shown
in the right hand panels of Fig. 2. The properly corrected
correlation should be equal to unity. The Gamow correc-
tion is obviously inappropriate. This is in agreement with
several theoretical studies [11,18,19] as well as previous
experimental observations [20,21]. The by H∆p corrected
π+π− correlation is close to unity. We therefore use the
same method to correct the π+π+ and π−π− correlation
functions.

The Gamow correction would lead to a signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent shape of the corrected correlation (see Fig. 2
and Table I).

In order to test possible distortions of the correlation
function introduced by the apparatus and the data anal-
ysis we performed a Monte Carlo simulation in which
we generated events with realistic particle multiplicities
and momenta, and propagated the particles through our
setup using GEANT [22]. The simulated detector re-
sponse was used as an input to the data analysis code.
The obtained correlation functions were equal to unity
as expected for a simulation without two-particle inter-
actions. Subsequently, we generated events in which posi-
tive pions were correlated. The obtained correlation func-
tions were ﬁtted and the ﬁt results were compared to the
parameters of the original correlation. The observed 3-
10% and 20% reductions of the radius parameters and the
correlation strength (see below for deﬁnitions), respec-
tively, are consistent with the broadening of the correla-
tion peak expected from the ﬁnite momentum resolution
of the spectrometer.

π+π+ and π−π− correlations were parametrized by

are shown as the solid line in Fig. 2. The ﬁt parameters
are given in Table I. Fitting Coulomb uncorrected cor-
relations gives the same R but a lower λ value of 0.32.
We estimate the uncertainty of λ because of the assump-
tions entering the Coulomb correction to be half of the
diﬀerence, i.e. 18%.

In the ‘out-side-long’ analysis, which was performed
in the beam rapidity frame yanal = 3.14, the three-
dimensional correlation functions were ﬁtted by

correlation functions. Solid lines represent projections

of the ﬁt.

The particles were labeled such that qlong>0. The
asymmetric shape of the projection C(qout), well repro-
duced by the ﬁt, is caused by the acceptance and the
ﬁnite width of the projection window. The parameters
obtained from the ﬁt are given in Table II. The values
were corrected for the momentum resolution of the spec-
trometer using the results of the Monte Carlo simulation.
Similarly as in the one-dimensional ﬁt, the π+ and π−
sources apparently diﬀer in size. We attribute this to
the distortion of the correlation function caused by the
Coulomb interaction between each of the pions and the

3

rest of the system [12].

The parameter Rside is most directly related to the
transverse size of the pion source. In order to compare it
to the projectile size we ﬁrst translated the r.m.s. radius
0.1 fm [23] to an equivalent
of a gold nucleus Rrms=5.3
Gaussian radius RG = 1/√3Rrms = 3.08
0.06 fm. The
0.2 for π−.
ratio Rside/RG is 1.3
This increase of the transverse size, combined with the
recent ﬁnding of transverse ﬂow velocities from analysis
of particle spectra [24,25], may be used to restrict the
expansion dynamics.

It has been shown recently that the two-meson correla-
tion function is related to the meson phase space density
(deﬁned as the number of particles per unit volume h3
in six-dimensional phase space) at freeze-out [26]. Using
the results from [26] we obtained the following formula:

where
the phase space density of pions
with momentum p, averaged over the spatial coordi-
nates, d3n/d3p is the diﬀerential pion multiplicity, and
λ, Rout, Rside, Rlong, and Rol are the numbers obtained
from the ‘out-side-long’ ﬁt to the correlation function.
This phase space density can be compared to a theo-
retical prediction assuming local equilibrium, i.e. to the
Bose-Einstein distribution function. However, pions from
long-lived resonances, which result in λ < 1 [7,27], de-
crease the mean phase space density. This component of
the source function is not thermalized and should be left
out from the comparison. Since for a case without long-
lived resonances λ = 1, and since the actual fraction of
pions coming from the core is √λ, the following formula
describes the average phase space density in the core:

Taking the correlation parameters from Table II (with
the error matrix properly taken into account) and us-

for several points in the (pt, y) plane (Table III).

We assume that the correlation parameters do not change
signiﬁcantly between the points and thus the entire mo-
mentum dependence comes from d3n/d3p; a more correct
approach would require a separate correlation analysis for
every (pt, y) bin.

In the absence of tranverse ﬂow and neglecting spectral
changes due to resonance decay, the phase space density
of pions in thermal equilibrium would follow the Bose-
Einstein distribution (for each pion species):

slopes [28,29], the neglect of transverse ﬂow seems to be
appropriate. Nevertheless, to estimate an upper limit for
the inﬂuence of ﬂow eﬀects we found by Monte Carlo
simulation that transverse ﬂow with β=0.3 results in a
phase space density lower by 20% than the one given by
Eq.(6). Deviations of the spectral shape from thermal
distribution due to ∆ decays could be handled best if the
analysis was done in bins of pt and y. This is planned
for the high-statistics data sets taken in the ’94 and ’95
runs of E877.

Under these assumptions, we can test the thermaliza-
tion of pions by comparing the experimental phase space
density to that given by Eq. (6). The comparison is sim-
pliﬁed by the fact that the experimental diﬀerential mul-
tiplicity can also be parametrized by the Bose-Einstein
function:

with two ﬁt parameters: eﬀective transverse tempera-
ture Teﬀ and normalization A. We assume that Teﬀ =
T / cosh(y
yS). Consequently, the comparison between
and f BE(p) is reduced to the comparison between

Since the pt-spectra have a somewhat concave shape, A
depends on the range of the ﬁt: low (high) pt’s yield high
(low) A. Using A obtained from a ﬁt to the entire mea-
sured transverse momentum spectra 0 < pt < 0.6 GeV/c
in the rapidity range 3.0–3.3 and the correlation param-
eters from Table II, we evaluated the experimental-to-
0.18 for π+
thermal density ratio of 0.97

and π−, respectively. Thus the experimental pion phase
space density is consistent with the presence of local equi-
librium.

Summarizing, the multi-dimensional pion source pa-
rameters have been determined in the Au+Au system at
the AGS. The observed source is signiﬁcantly larger than
a gold nucleus. The extracted pion phase space density
at freeze-out indicates local equilibrium.

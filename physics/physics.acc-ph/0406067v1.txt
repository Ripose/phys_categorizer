Abstract

The MuCool Test Area (MTA) is an intense primary beam facility derived di-
rectly from the Fermilab Linac to test heat deposition and other technical concerns
associated with the liquid hydrogen targets being developed for cooling intense muon
beams. In this shielding study the results of Monte Carlo radiation shielding calcula-
tions performed using the MARS14 code for the MuCool Test Area and including the
downstream portion of the target hall and berm around it, access pit, service building,
and parking lot are presented and discussed within the context of the proposed MTA
experimental conﬁguration.

1 Introduction

The MTA facility is being designed to test targets and other muon cooling apparatus using
the intense Fermilab Linac beam. The requested intensity of the proton beam for the MTA
is essentially full Linac capability [1], or 1.3 × 1013 protons per pulse at a 15 Hz repetition
rate and an energy of 400 MeV. This intensity represents a factor of two beyond the current
safety envelope of Fermilab Linac.
If it is later determined the safety envelope cannot
practically be exceeded, the reduced intensity is still acceptable and sufﬁcient to test the
MuCool targets and apparatus.

This extremely high intensity implies careful investigation into and application of proper
shielding materials and conﬁguration in order to satisfy the following two requirements: (i)
to reduce the instantaneous dose rate outside of the experimental enclosure to prescribed
levels appropriate for the area considered; (ii) to ensure the civil construction of the hall is
capable of additional shielding and, further, that the weight of the shielding is commensu-
rate with the loading speciﬁcations of the enclosure, notably the ceiling.

The radiation shielding calculations for the MuCool experimental enclosure were per-
formed with the MARS14 [2] code for both normal operation and accidental beam loss.

Normalization is per 2 × 1014 protons per second unless otherwise stated. Various shield-
ing options were explored in detail and the ﬁnal, most effective, and, therefore, minimal,
shielding conﬁgurations are presented. The possible factor of two reduction as indicated
above does not effectively alter the shielding conclusions and requirements established in
this document. Gerrymandering or reduction of the shielding can only be accomplished
unless the intensity is reduced by an order of magnitude from full capability. Further, addi-
tional shielding above the enclosure (beyond the present berm level) will be required unless
the intensity is reduced by another order of magnitude, or two orders of magnitude down
from Linac capability.

A Cartesian coordinate system is established in which a three-dimensional geometry model
of the enclosure, target and beamline components, and exterior shielding is described. The
X - and Z-axes are shown in Fig. 1, with the Y -axis being directed toward a reader to com-
plete the right-handed coordinate system. Thus, the positive direction for the X -axis is
upward while for the Z-axis it follows the direction of the beam, i.e. downstream. The
origin of the coordinate system, (0, 0, 0), is chosen at the geometrical center of the target
(see Fig. 1). Previous studies have addressed activation and loss conditions on experimental
components in the enclosure. However, for the purposes of shielding against normal op-
eration, the target and beam absorber are the only signiﬁcant sources for radiation outside

the enclosure. Further, it has been established, as will be discussed, that normal operation
represents the severest radiological control problems, not accident conditions as this is a
target hall.

As for the color scheme employed to denote materials in the geometry model, the fol-
lowing convention applies to any system: white, black, light blue, green, and grey colors
correspond to vacuum, black hole (artiﬁcial material used in MARS modeling that absorbs
100% of incoming radiation), air, soil, and regular concrete, respectively. (The meaning of
the other colors can vary depending on materials used in the system under consideration.)
It should be taken into account also that boundaries between different regions are shown
with black lines. When the resolution of the ﬁgure is inadequate, small regions sometimes
are not distinguishable and appear as black regions.

2.1 Target hall

A cross-sectional slice of the three-dimensional calculation model of the MTA is presented
in detail in Fig. 1. It consists of the downstream 40 feet of the target hall, the target it-
self with associated windows and cryogenics, the beamline, the beam absorber, and the
surrounding shielding. The shielding layers of iron and dirt shown in the Figure represent
only one of many shielding options and conﬁgurations which were modeled. (The current
enclosure shielding contains only 11 feet of berm.) The upstream portion of the target hall,
which is a pre-cast concrete enclosure, is approximately 30 feet in length, 10 feet in width,
and is not considered in the model. The upstream portion stretches from the shield-block
wall under the hatch to the “step”, where ﬂoor level drops more than 2 feet in elevation
from 738 feet 7 inches to 736 feet 6 inches. Calculation of the optimal shielding thickness
and composition for the experimental enclosure is the main goal of the study and discussed
in the following sections.

For the purposes of a thorough and more complete study, we considered two target
models: a copper disk 1 cm in thickness in addition to the liquid hydrogen as designed
for MuCool. Taking into account the data on the proton interaction lengths presented in
Table 1, the models with the copper disk and 21-cm liquid hydrogen absorber with two 200-
µm aluminum windows correspond to 10% and 2% of the proton total interaction length,
respectively. Thus the model with the copper disk enables us to perform the radiation
shielding assessment for a more general dose rate as would be expected for operations
which involve targets other than liquid hydrogen, or more windows, or evacuation of liquid
hydrogen from the target, or even alternate “thicker-window” designs for liquid hydrogen
absorbers. (Liquid hydrogen is effective in reducing the dose rates at the top of the berm by
about 30% for 400 MeV incident protons as compared with an evacuated target. However,
one cannot rely on liquid hydrogen always being present in the beam in this facility.) The
soil considered in the study is supposed to be compacted one with the density characteristic
of the Fermilab site, i.e. 2.24 g/cm3.

2.2 Labyrinth and access pit

Contributions to the computed dose levels were taken from a model of the lower level
of the area, which extends over the region of −190 cm ≤ X ≤ −20 cm, and which is
presented in Fig. 2 at X = 0 to show simultaneously both the labyrinth personnel entrance
and target (see Fig. 1). This range in the X −region was chosen to represent an average
human height. All the essential components of the MTA were included in the model, in
particular, the labyrinth between the access pit and target hall. It will be shown below that,
because of relatively high dose levels, one must consider the access pit as a “Radiation
Area”. Therefore, unauthorized access to the pit must be prohibited when the proton beam
is on.

2.3 Penetrations and service building

The model of the upper level of the area, 90 cm ≤ X ≤ 260 cm (see Fig. 1), is shown
in Fig. 3. There is also an internal door located approximately in the middle of the wall
between the refrigerator and compressor rooms . The model includes, in particular, six pen-
etrations (channels) between the target hall and refrigerator room. Two of the penetrations
(10′′ and 8′′ in diameter) are designated for helium transfer lines while the other four ones
(4′′ in diameter each) are reserved for future use. In this model it is assumed that the latter
four penetrations are ﬁlled with air.

This level is of major concern because it includes parking lots near Fermilab booster
tower and, in fact, is open to general public. It will be shown below that the most signiﬁ-
cant source of radiation at this level is comprised of high-energy (100–300 MeV) neutrons
delivered through the penetrations.

3 Calculation Results

3.1 Berm around the target hall

3.1.1 Accidental beam loss

The scenario which describes the worst accidental beam loss occurs when the errant pro-
ton beam hits the beamline at Z=-280 cm (see Fig. 1) with a deﬂection angle of 50 mrad
upward. The beam can acquire such a deﬂection due to tuning or malfunction of upstream
magnets. Within the framework of this scenario, the calculated highest prompt dose in the
shielding is observed right above the target assembly, i.e. near Z=0 (see Fig. 1). This sce-
nario describes the worst possible case (when modeling 8-GeV proton beam accidents at
Fermilab booster, a deﬂection angle of about 1 mrad is the standard considered [3]). If mis-
steered beam hits the beamline downstream of the target assembly, additional or increased
thickness in shielding layers come into play (either beamline components, beam absorber
shielding, lower angles through the shielding, or all of these) thus providing lower prompt
dose above the berm when compared to our assumed worst scenario.

Figure 4: Calculated distribution of prompt dose equivalent in the dirt shielding above
the MTA target hall and near Z=0 due to the accidental beam loss. The calculation was
performed with the liquid hydrogen absorber as the target.

The calculated distribution of prompt dose in the shielding above the target hall is
shown in Fig. 4. The numbers on the left and right of the color bar correspond to the
highest and lowest value, respectively, presented in the two-dimensional histogram (the re-
gions with values outside of the current limits are shown with white color). To estimate

6

dose rate on the top of the berm one can use a dose attenuation curve calculated previously
for 400-MeV protons in similar shielding [4] starting from a region with well-deﬁned dose.
In this way one can determine that the dose rate on the top of the initially proposed 11-feet
dirt shielding is about 0.016 mrem/s in general. The target itself is of secondary importance
for the dose above the shielding after the missteered beam strikes the beamline.

With only 11′ of shielding in place, an active system (chipmunks) protects the Linac
enclosure against accident conditions and could, in principle, be applied to the experimental
hall enclosure. However, the integrated accidental dose rate is comparable to the levels
experienced during normal operation for every level of shielding (since beam strikes a
target). An active system can not protect against normal operation, therefore, the passive
shielding necessary for normal operation is sufﬁcient to shield against achievable accident
conditions. Active interlocks are not required. (Active interlocks will be explored upstream
of the experimental hall up to the point of Linac extraction since no target sources are
involved.)

Figure 5: Calculated distribution of prompt dose equivalent in the dirt shielding above the

copper disk as the target.

A calculated distribution of prompt dose in the shielding above the target hall for normal
operation is shown in Fig. 5. Similar two-dimensional distributions were obtained also for

7

various iron-dirt and BMCN-dirt compositions. The BMCN stands here for a high-density
concrete (3.64 g/cm3) that contains, in particular, 55% of iron by weight while for regular
concrete the number is 1.4%. To determine the amount of required shielding, the above-
mentioned dose attenuation curve of reference [4] can be used again. For a more convenient
analysis we used also a simple expression describing dose attenuation in a thick shielding
sandwich:

AttenuationFactor = e

−( x1
1

+

x2
2

),

(1)

where x1 and x2 are thicknesses of the ﬁrst and second material, respectively, and a 1 and
a 2 are attenuation lenghts for these materials. Deviations of a real attenuation law from
such a pure exponential one can be neglected for thick shieldings [4].

First of all, using the expression (1) we have calculated the dependence of the dose rate
on the top of the berm on thickness of the uniform shielding (see Fig. 6). This distribution
is useful as a starting and comparison point in the analysis of the shielding requirements.
The data veriﬁes that a minimum of 16.4′ of compacted dirt is needed to prevent the top of
the berm from being deﬁned as a radiation area (which means dose rate above 5 mrem/hr)
and the 19′ convention is the recommended level.

Shielding thickness (ft)

Figure 6: Calculated dose rate on the top of the MTA berm at normal operation vs shielding
thickness for a general target (copper disk 1 cm in thickness).

Using the expression (1) we have also calculated shielding compositions which provide
a required attenuation factor for iron-dirt and BMCN-dirt sandwiches (see Fig. 7). The
calculated attenuation lengths a
for the dirt, high-density concrete, and iron were equal to
38.7, 28.4, and 22.8 cm, respectively. The difference observed between the two predictions
for pure dirt shielding (0.6 feet or, in other words, 3%) is due to the approximation asso-
ciated with the expression (1) and calculated attenuation lengths a
. One can see from the

8

a
a
distributions that, taking into account the weight of the shielding, compositions of the high-
density concrete and dirt look preferable when compared to iron-dirt sandwiches. This is
best illustrated by comparing weight with shielding effectiveness. Iron is 7.87 g/cm3 com-
pared to 3.64 g/cm3 for heavy concrete, or a 2.2 to 1 weight ratio, but their relative shielding
effectiveness is only 1.2 to 1 for the same volume, respectively. This effect is due to the
fact that the radiation propagating through the berm consists mostly of secondary nucleons
generated in the target in inelastic nuclear collisions. The average energy of such secon-
daries is in a few MeV region. At this low an energy, there is no advantage in using pure
iron as the shielding material. Materials containing light nuclei are the most effective.

With a load capacity of 19′ equivalent of dirt, and assuming the top layer must be 2′
of berm to stop thermal neutrons, the enclosure can only support 17 equivalent feet of dirt
by weight. This corresponds to 10.5′ of heavy concrete and only 5′ of iron. With this
weight restriction, the dose rate at the surface of the berm is about 100 times higher with
iron shielding than with heavy concrete. The berm levels using heavy concrete are 8 times
above the 19′ dirt standard.

With this degree of shielding and normal operation, the surface of berm can be classiﬁed
as a “Controlled Area” with minimal occupancy which implies a dose rate from 0.25 up to
5 mrem/hr [5].

3.2 Access pit

All the calculations described hereinafter were performed with the 1-cm thick copper disk
as a target. The calculated dose distributions in the access pit are shown in Fig. 8. From the
target hall to access pit, a dose reduction within a factor of 106 is observed, which means
this is a typical thick-shielding problem. Therefore, using a variance reduction technique
like mathematical expectation method is justiﬁed and mandatory.

In addition, all the calculations were performed with the MCNP option turned ’on’ to
provide the most accurate available at present treatment of low-energy (under 20 MeV)
neutron transport [7]. The MCNP option is essential to get reliable results because such
neutrons dominate in the target hall (see next section).

At both lower and upper level one can see a number of hot spots with dose level from
10 to 100 mrem/hr. An examination of the calculated two-dimensional dose distribution
gives rise to a conclusion that the main weakness of the existing shielding is in signiﬁcant
amount of empty space in the labyrinth (see Fig. 2). A proper choice of a local shielding in
the labyrinth would help to reduce the dose at the lower level of the access pit.

During normal operation the access pit is expected to be classiﬁed as a “Radiation Area”
consisting of rigid barriers with locked gates (requirements for a dose rate from 5 up to 100
mrem/hr [5]).

Figure 9: Calculated dose distribution in the service building of the MTA.

The dose distribution in and surrounding the service building is computed for the region of
90 cm ≤ X ≤ 260 cm, and presented in Fig. 9. There are a number of hot spots in parking

11

lot with dose levels ranging from 10 to 100 mrem/hr. Inside the refrigerator room and near
the penetrations the dose is from 100 to 1000 mrem/hr. One can see also that the highest
contribution to the dose comes from the 10′′ penetration which is in between the 4′′ and 8′′
ones but at a different height in X .

Three of the six penetrations are shown in the Figure: one 8′′ and two 4′′ in diameter.
The most distinctive feature of the distribution is existence of a directed, intense neutron
beam shooting through the penetrations. The dirt between the target hall and service build-
ing serves, in fact, as a collimator for neutrons generated in proton collisions with target
nuclei [6]. As a result, in the service building and at parking lot one has a well collimated,
low divergence beam composed of high energy (∼200 MeV) neutrons. Neutron spectra at
both ends of the largest (10′′) penetration are shown in Fig. 10.

Figure 10: Calculated neutron spectra inside the 10′′ penetration at its end near target hall
(left) and refrigerator room (right).

To reduce the dose in the parking lot and in the service building, the following options were
examined:

• A wall in the target hall in front of the penetrations.

• A wall instead of the door between the two rooms in the service building.

• Two iron collimators, 2′′ thick and 20′′ in length, placed inside the 10′′ penetration (at
both ends) as well as two iron collimators, 1′′ thick and 20′′ in length, placed inside
the 8′′ penetration (at both ends).

The three options for additional shielding are shown in Figure 11. The wall in the tar-
get hall was considered consisting of two parts: a concrete pedestal (lower) and tungsten
shielding itself (upper). Thickness and position of the wall were not optimized. The tung-
sten was chosen because of its high material density and absence of pronounced magnetic
properties. The latter is important from the standpoint of mechanical stability in the pres-
ence of superconducting magnets (in the vicinity of the wall) in the event of a quench. As
for the third option, thicknesses of the iron collimators were chosen to ﬁt the remaining

One can see from the qualitative comparison that both the second and third option
provide better shielding and give rise to a lower dose level at parking lot when compared
to the ﬁrst option. Therefore, a separate calculation was performed for a combination
of the second and third options, i.e. with both the wall instead of the inner door in the
service building and iron collimators installed. The calculated dose distribution is shown
in Fig. 13. One can see that the combined shielding reduces the dose at the parking lot to
0.1–1 mrem/hr.

Figure 13: Calculated dose distribution in the service building and around at normal opera-
tion for a combination of the second and third shielding options (normalization is per 1014
protons per second).

In addition, integral dose was calculated for a cylindrical tissue-equivalent model of a hu-
man body placed at the parking lot near the roll-up door to the compressor room, i.e. at the
hottest place. The predicted integral dose equals to 0.4 mrem/hr, but with a high statistical
uncertainty (1s ≃ 50%).

During normal operation, the public parking lot must be considered as a normal (not
controlled) area without postings. Therefore, the dose level there must not exceed 0.05
mrem/hr [5]. To satisfy this requirement, an additional removable 50-cm concrete shielding

block is necessary near the internal wall in the refrigerator room. At the same time, the
compressor and refrigerator rooms are expected to be classiﬁed as “Controlled Area” with
minimal occupancy (a dose rate from 0.25 up to 5 mrem/hr) and “Radiation Area” with
rigid barriers with locked gates (a rate from 5 up 100 mrem/hr), respectively [5].

4 Conclusions

Within the framework of a credible accident scenario, a beam accident at the MuCool
Test Area is less severe than normal operation. It is the normal operating conditions that
determine the level of shielding required.

Further, it has been shown that shielding sandwiches of high-density concrete and dirt
provide a much improved dose attenuation above the MTA than iron-dirt sandwiches con-
sidering the load capacity of the hall enclosure. Since the enclosure ceiling only supports
19 equivalent feet of compacted soil, only 10.5′ of heavy concrete and 5′ of iron can be sup-
ported, assuming 2′ of berm is required on top. The corresponding dose rates for full Linac
intensity range from 1 to 5 mrem/hr for the considered targets (liquid hydrogen and copper,
respectively) and heavy concrete shielding blocks. The rates for iron shielding range from
100 to 500 mrem/hr. The heavy concrete alternative also allows the total shielding height to
be reduced from the 16.4′ pure-dirt height to at least 12.5′. Overall, the heavy concrete-dirt
shielding is preferable.

A solid concrete wall replacing the inner door in the service building, iron collimators
situated inside the 8′′ and 10′′ penetrations as well as additional 50-cm concrete block near
the inner wall in the refrigerator room are required to suppress the outgoing high-energy
neutron beam to a predicted dose level at the parking lot not exceeding 0.05 mrem/hr for a
beam intensity of 1014 protons per second. Sand could replace the iron collimators, if used
along the entire length of the penetrations.

After implementing all of the shielding described above, normal operation requires the

different areas around the MTA target hall to be classiﬁed as follows [5]:

• Berm above the target hall – Controlled Area of minimal occupancy (0.25 - 5 mrem/hr).

• Access pit – Radiation Area with rigid barriers with locked gates (5 - 100 mrem/hr).

• Refrigerator room – Radiation Area with rigid barriers with locked gates (5 - 100

mrem/hr).

0.05 mrem/hr).

• Compressor room – Controlled Area of minimal occupancy (0.25 - 5 mrem/hr).

• Parking lot – Unlimited occupancy area without any precautions (dose rate below

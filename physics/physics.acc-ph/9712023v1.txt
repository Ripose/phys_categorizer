A. Introduction

The recent observation of t-quark at FNAL [1] is a triumph in the realm of Standard Model (SM). In order to conﬁrm
the basic principles of the SM, observation of the Higgs boson which gives the masses to the fundamental particles
is needed. Today, the SM explains practically all experimental data on elementary particles and their interactions.
However, there are number of problems which have not been clariﬁed by the SM. In particular: i) Masses and mixings
of fundamental fermions, ii) Existence of fermion families and their number, iii) Arbitrary assignment of left-handed
particles to weak isospin doublets and right-handeds to singlets, iv) SM does not really unify strong, weak and
electromagnetic interactions, because each of them are described by their own gauge groups (Appearance of photon as
a mixture of gauge bosons corresponding to weak hypercharge and third component of weak isospin does not change
the above statement). To solve these problems, diﬀerent approaches beyond the SM have been proposed: extension
of electroweak symmetry, GUT’s, SUSY, preonic models, etc. Generally, all extensions of the SM (with the possible
exceptions of minimal GUT’s, namely, SU(5) and SO(10)) predict the rich spectrum of new particles as well as new
interactions at TeV scale.

It is known that the results from lepton-hadron collisions have been playing a crucial role in particle physics. The
establishment of the quark-parton structure of the matter is the best example. If the new results [2] from HERA are
veriﬁed we ought to review the research strategies in high energy physics.

There are two well-known ways to reach TeV scale c.m. energies at constituent level: the ring type proton-proton
colliders and the linear e+e− colliders (including γe and γγ options [3]). Recently two more methods have been added
to the list, namely: the ring type µ+µ− colliders [4] and the linac-ring type ep colliders [5,6,7,8,9,10] (including γp
option [6,11]).

In this paper we review the status of linac-ring type ep and γp colliders. In the section B, main parameters of
linac-ring type ep colliders are discussed. The section C is devoted to main parameters of γp machines. Section D
deals with e-nucleus and γ-nucleus colliders. Finally, in section E, we brieﬂy discuss physics goals of colliders under
consideration.

B. Linac-ring type ep colliders

It is well-known that the energy achievable in an electron storage ring is limited, because synchrotron radiation
E4). Even with the largest e+e− storage ring the beam energy
(SR) increases rapidly with the beam energy (∆E
can not be extended far beyond 100 GeV. In addition, the luminosity in a storage ring is limited by the beam-beam
interaction. The way out of these problems is the linear collider scheme. Because, here the SR losses are avoided
and the beam-beam interaction limits are much weaker. A number of high energy and high luminosity linear collider
proposals are under discussion (TESLA, NLC, JLC etc.) [12]. For the same reasons new linac-ring type ep colliders
have been proposed in order to achieve TeV scale c.m. energies at constituent level [5,6,7,8,9,10]. In this scheme the
electron beam from a linear accelerator (linac) is collided with a proton beam stored in a ring. Essential advantage
of the linac-ring type ep colliders is closeness of electron and proton beam energies resulting with good kinematics.

∼

There are two reasons favoring a superconducting linear collider (TESLA) as a source of e-beam for linac-ring type
colliders. First of all the spacing between bunches in conventional linac is only of the order of ns. This doesn’t match
with the bunch spacing in the proton ring. Also the pulse length is much shorter than the ring circumference. Then
in a conventional linear collider, one can use only half of the machine, because the traveling wave structures can
accelerate only in one direction. There is no such limitation for TESLA (standing wave cavities).

For these reasons we concentrate on HERA+TESLA and LHC+TESLA options. In these cases following points and
limitations should be considered: Achievable luminosity is constrained by the electron beam power, limited emittance
of the proton beam and practical limits on focusing strength at the interaction point. In addition, intra-beam scattering
in proton beam should be taken into account, since it causes emittance growth.

For round beams and equal transverse beam sizes for e and p at the crossing point, the luminosity can be expressed

as:

(1)

where εN
collision frequency, γp is proton Lorentz factor and β⋆ is amplitude function at interaction point.

p is normalized proton beam emittance, ne and np are the numbers of electrons and protons per bunch, fb is

Lep =

nenpfbγp
p β∗
4πεN

Once the electron beam energy is chosen, the total electron beam current Ie = ne

fb is limited by the allowed
electron beam power (Ie = Pe/Ee). As follows from Eqn.(1), Lep is independent of ne and fb as long as their product
is constant. With the consideration of power limitation, luminosity is given by [7]

In a recent paper [13] HERA+TESLA option is studied in more detail. At this study luminosity limitation,
interaction region layout, intra-beam scattering (IBS) growth times and proton beam cooling for this collider are
investigated. It is shown that, with some modiﬁcations of accelerating gradient and RF-system power, beam pulse
current can be increased by a factor of 2.5. Luminosity for this option (Ep = 820GeV, Ee = 250GeV ) has been
1031cm−2s−1. In addition, for εxεy = const, using ﬂat proton beam (εy = 0.1εx) IBS growth time
calculated as 1.3
can be taken as 2 hours while for εy = εx it is less than one hour. For higher luminosity, emittance cooling of proton
beams at very high energies must be managed by advanced cooling methods as optical, stochastic or electron cooling.
To satisfy an emittance doubling time to be not smaller than 5h, SPS experience shows that tune shift parameter is
10−3 [14]. Lower limit on β∗ is given by the p-beam bunch length. This limitation can
better to be limited to ∆Q = 4
be overcome by applying dynamic focusing scheme, where the p-beam waist travels with the e-bunch during collision
[10].

C. Linac-ring type γp colliders

Earlier, the idea of obtaining high energy photon beams by Compton backscattering of laser light oﬀ a beam of
high energy electrons was considered for γe and γγ colliders [15]. The same method can be used for constructing
γp colliders on the base of linac-ring type ep machines. A γp collider option will open important horizons to the
TeV scale physics. At the standard ep colliders proton can be probed by Weizs¨acker-Williams photons. When we
compare Weizs¨acker-Williams photon spectrum with real photon spectrum obtained from backscattering, we easily
see advantage of the real photon beam since real photons are generated mostly on high energy end of the energy scale
while Weizs¨acker-Williams photons are generated mostly on low energy end. The second advantage of linac-ring type
γp collider is good kinematics, that is, the energy of the γ beam is close to the energy of the valence quark. Therefore,
events after collisions can be observed at wider angles. The third advantage of the linac-ring type γp collider is high
polarization of γ beam.

For the main parameters of the linac-ring type γp colliders, we will use electron and proton beam parameters that

In Figures 1 and 2, the dependence of luminosity on distance between the conversion region and the collision point is
plotted for three diﬀerent choices of laser photons and electron beam helicities for HERA+TESLA and LHC+TESLA,
respectively. Minimum wavelengths of the laser (corresponding to κ = 4.83) for HERA+TESLA and LHC+TESLA
are estimated as 1.2 µm and 3.8 µm, respectively. Mirror systems for the multiple use of laser pulses for the conversion
of a number of successive electron bunches are necessary in the case of multibunch structure of linac pulses. This
point raises from the fact that lasers with suﬃciently high power per pulse seem to be not available in the near future
for pulse rates much higher than 100 Hz.

Figure 3 shows luminosity distributions of HERA+TESLA depending on γp invariant mass Wγp = 2

EγEp at
z = 6 m. Again the advantage of opposite helicities of laser photons and electron beam is obvious. Similar plots hold
for LHC+TESLA. Interpretation of these ﬁgures leads to some important conclusions: Luminosity slowly decreases
with the distance between the conversion region and the collision point. Opposite helicity values for laser and electron
beams are advantageous for photon spectrum. Additionally, a better monochromatization for high energy gamma
beam can be achieved by increasing the distance z. Also mean helicity of the high energy gamma beam approaches
to unity with increasing distance.

D. e-Nucleus and γ-Nucleus Colliders

The linac-ring type ep and γp colliders could be used with some modiﬁcation as e-nucleus and γ-nucleus machines
[16] to investigate the properties of nuclei at TeV scale region. Indeed, LHC will give opportunity to accelerate nuclei
too, and the acceleration of nuclei in HERA ring is under discussion. Therefore, we estimate basic parameters for such
machines with the examples of carbon and lead beams (Table III). When it comes to electron beam, it is considered
to be produced by TESLA (Table II).

Center of mass energy and luminosity values of e-nucleus and γ-nucleus collisions are presented in Table IV. Here
we take into account that the energy of converted photons is restricted by the condition given in Eqn. (8). Then,
the luminosity of e-nucleus collisions is calculated using Eqns. (1) and (2) with appropriate substitution of proton
beam parameters with nucleus beam parameters. It is clear that Lγ-nucleus
Le-nucleus at z = 0m. The dependence
of luminosity on distance between the conversion region and collision point is similar to γp option: at z = 10m
luminosity value reduces by factor

1.5 comparing to that at z = 0m.

≈

We also present the values of γ-nucleon luminosities and luminosities per collision. Multiplying last ones by
10−26 cm2 for γ-Pb collisions) one obtain the number of

10−27 cm2 for γ-C and 4

extrapolated cross sections (2
events per collision and this number is less than one.

×
Finally, by applying dynamic focusing scheme [10] one can use essentially lower values of β∗ and therefore achieve
several times higher luminosities. Further increase of the luminosity might be achieved if eﬀective method of cooling
of nuclei beams is invented.

E. Physics at TeV Energy ep and γp Colliders

Although physics search programs of new ep and γp colliders are much less developed than those of LHC, NLC and
µ+µ− collider, a lot of papers on this subject were published during the last decade. The physics at UNK+VLEPP
based ep and γp colliders were considered in [17] and [18,19], correspondingly. Resonant production of excited quarks
at γp colliders was investigated in [20]. Reference [21] dealt with physics at future γγ, γe and γp colliders. Wino
production at HERA+LC based γp collider was considered in [22]. Today, the main activity on this subject is
concentrated in Ankara University HEP group [23-34]. In Reference [35] physics search potential of HERA+LC based
γp collider had been reviewed. Recently, Higgs boson production at LHC+LEP based γp collider has been studied in
[36] and [37], however their results should be recalculated because (as argued in [11]) γp colliders can be constructed
only on the base of linac-ring type ep machines.

1. Physics at Linac-Ring Type ep Colliders

This topic was suﬃciently developed during preparation of HERA and study of LHC+LEP physics search potential.

The linac-ring type machines will give opportunity to investigate appropriate phenomena at

higher center of mass energies,
better kinematic conditions.

Below we present discovery limits for 100 events per year:
γp colliders are ideal machines for u∗, d∗ and Z8 search

HERA+TESLA: mu∗ = 0.9 TeV, md∗ = 0.7 TeV, mZ8 = 0.7 TeV
LHC+TESLA: mu∗ = 5 TeV, md∗ = 4 TeV, mZ8 = 4 TeV

LHC+TESLA: 0.8 TeV

associative gaugino-squark production (m ˜G + mq)

HERA+TESLA: 0.5 TeV
LHC+TESLA: 2.0 TeV

It is clear that physics search potential of linac ring type ep and γp colliders is comparable with and complementary
to that of basic hadron and lepton colliders. Upgraded Tevatron, NLC with √s = 0.5T eV and HERA+TESLA will
give possibility to investigate in details 0.5TeV scale. Similarly LHC, NLC with √s = 2T eV , µ+µ− with √s = 4T eV
and LHC+TESLA will give opportunity to investigate TeV scale physics in the best manner by use of all possible
colliding beams.

3. Physics at γ-nucleus colliders

Center of mass energy of LHC+TESLA based γ-nucleus collider corresponds to Eγ

PeV in the lab. system. At
this energy range cosmic ray experiments have a few events per year, whereas γ-nucleus collider will give few billions
events. Very preliminary list of physics goals contains:

formation of the quark-gluon plasma at very high temperatures but relatively low nuclear densities

F. Conclusion

There are strong arguments favoring that the rich spectrum of new particles and/or interactions will manifest
themselves at TeV scale. An exploration of this scale at constituent level will require all possible types of colliding
beams. Today, work on physics search programs and machine parameters for future hadron and lepton colliders
is quite advanced, whereas those for linac-ring type lepton-hadron colliders need an additional R&D. In machine
aspects: it seems possible to increase luminosity up to 1031cm−2s−1 for HERA+TESLA and up to 1032cm−2s−1 for
LHC+TESLA by the development in this ﬁeld (dynamic focusing, cooling technics, etc.). For physics goals: more
detailed investigations of all possible processes are needed.

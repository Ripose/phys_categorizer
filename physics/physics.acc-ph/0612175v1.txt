Abstract

We consider methods of charged particle acceleration by means of high-intensity
lasers. As an application we discuss a laser booster for heavy ion beams provided, e.g. by
the Dubna nuclotron. Simple estimates show that a cascade of crossed laser beams would
be necessary to provide additional acceleration to gold ions of the order of GeV/nucleon.

The idea of particle acceleration by means of laser ﬁelds was ﬁrst considered in [1, 2].
Recently, due to the fast development of “table-top” high-intensity lasers with intensities
up to 1022 W/cm2 [3], these systems have become interesting for the development of
booster systems for the upgrade of existing accelerators which operate just below the

acceleration by a few GeV/nucleon would allow studies of the onset of quark matter
formation in heavy-ion collisions. Such sudies require a ﬁne-tuning in beam energies
(energy scan), which be possible with the laser booster provided the required range of
acceleration can be reached.

We start by considering the light pressure action on a beam of charged particles.
When absorbing a photon the nucleus makes a transition to an excited state and receives
an additional velocity in the direction of the photon propagation. After that, the excited
nucleus can spontaneously emit a photon and receives some additional momentum. As
a result of multiple scattering, the momentum of the nucleus gets incremented along the
laser beam. In the oscillator model of nuclei one obtains the following estimate for the
light pressure [2]:

¯hωn is the n-th energy level of the nucleus, and kn is the corresponding oscillator strength
taking into account the the speciﬁcs of the nucleus.

The application of the light pressure mechanism to the problem of ion acceleration
encounters numerous obstacles. First, it is the saturation eﬀect which is associated with
the time delay of the vacation of the excited state of nuclei. Second, there is the required
condition of resonance between the laser ﬁeld frequency and nuclear excitation energy.

When the nucleus receives additional energy due to the action of the laser pulse, the
condition of resonance brakes because of the Doppler eﬀect and therefore the acceleration
force will decrease. The electromagnetic wave frequencies ω and ω′ in the proper reference
frame and in the laboratory one are related by by

acts only in transverse direction and does not bring a considerable contribution to the
acceleration of a particle along the ﬁeld. If the energy ε∗ has the order of some tens of
keV (for 179Au we have ε∗ = 72 keV), the X-ray laser should have a frequency of the
order of 1 MeV. This exceeds considerably the possibilities of modern X-ray lasers [4],
for which the typical values of frequencies are less than 10% of the electron mass.

p

In case of optical lasers, when the frequency is much smaller than the lowest nuclear
excitation level, there are other ways of charged particle acceleration by means of the ac-
tion of gradient forces caused by the interaction between ions and the envelope of the laser
electrical ﬁeld. Let us consider a plane electromagnetic wave E(r, t) = E(r) exp(iωt). The
corresponding gradient force is [2, 5, 6]

F = α∇E 2.

(4)

Under the action of such force, ions move aside to decrease their potential energy and get
localized in the knots of the wave. In each point the gradient force has transverse and
longitudinal components but the average of the longitudinal component vanishes. Under
the action of the gradient force particles are localized in potential wells. As was shown in
[7] using special ﬂuctuations with various frequencies it is possible to receive a potential
proﬁle varying in time. In particular, it is possible to create conditions for accelerated
motion of potential wells with particles localized in them. However, there is a grave
disadvantage of this method. That is the fact that the accelerated particle oscillates
with the frequency of the external ﬁeld in the local reference frame. The eﬃciency of
such a mechanism is less than that of a linear accelerator. In real laser beams due to the
non-uniform radial distribution of intensity the gradient force can expel particles from
the laser ﬁeld. As shown in [8], this eﬀect depends on the relation of the frequency of
the external ﬁeld to the eigenfrequency of the particle oscillation.

Another way to transfer additional energy to charged particles is to construct special
geometrical schemes of laser beams. A scheme to accelerate electrons by means of two
crossed laser beams was proposed in the works [9]-[11]. The basic idea is to send the
electron or ion through the crossing point of two laser beams at an angle θ with respect
to each beam direction [12]. Such a geometry allows to create some longitudinally pulling
electric ﬁeld

Ez = −2E0 g(η) sin θ cos η, η = ω [ t − (z/c) cos θ],

where g(η) is some envelope function. The ion energy gain, as a result of the interaction
with η/2π cycles of the accelerating ﬁeld, may be deﬁned by

Figure 1: The energy gain of fully ionized gold ions Au79+ vs. the crossing half-angle θ for
η = π/2 (left) and also vs. the number of ﬁeld cycles for θ=θmax=14◦(right), γ0=4, g(η)=1.

The size of the energy increment depends on the crossing angle. An optimal angle θmax
exists which corresponds to the maximum energy gain for a given set of laser parameters
and particle beam initial conditions. Fig.1 shows, that if the ion-ﬁeld interaction would
be terminated in the neighborhood of any one of the points corresponding to η = (2N +
1/2)π, where N is an integer number, the ion would escape with maximum energy gain.
The energy gains tend to get canceled by the energy losses for interaction with an even
number of ﬁeld cycles. For the purpose of acceleration, the assumption is that the ion
may be ejected from the region of interaction while it still retains part or all of the
energy gained. The calculation shows that the optimal half-crossing angle for Au79+ is
θmax ≈ 14◦ for g(η) = 1 and θmax ≈ 20◦ for the g(η) = sin2(η/10) envelope. The maximal
energy gain reaches 25 GeV per ion (140 MeV/nucleon) for a laser intensity of the order
of 1022 W/cm2. The value of the optimal angle allows the realization of a cascade of
laser - ion beam interactions by means of multiple reﬂection of the laser beams from a
sequence of mirrors positioned symmetric to the beam axis.

The initial condition used here are somewhat artiﬁcial. We have simply stated that
the ion is born at the origin of coordinates at t = 0 inside the plane wave which, by
deﬁnition, has an inﬁnite extension in both space and time. Fig.2 shows that such an
ion tends to gain more energy from the ﬁeld if it starts oﬀ at a higher speed. The gain
exhibits saturation with increasing injection energy at about γ0 ≈ 20 for the parameters
used. The radiative losses of the accelerated ion can be evaluated by the relativistic
version of the Larmor formula [13] and become negligible.

Our preliminary evaluation shows that the most promising method for the laser accel-
eration of ions is based on the crossed laser beam scheme. The light pressure mechanism
in not relevant due to insuﬃcient frequency of the laser ﬁeld even for modern X-ray

lasers. The action of gradient forces on laser beam is also less eﬀective than the usual
linear accelerator scheme. We have disregarded here some eﬀects which are important
for the practical realisation of the laser booster as, for example, the presence of residual
gas in the channel of the ion beam.

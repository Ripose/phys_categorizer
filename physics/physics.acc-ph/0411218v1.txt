MUON ACCELERATION USING FIXED FIELD, ALTERNATING
GRADIENT (FFAG) RINGS

Received 23 November 2004

Given their 2.2 µS lifetime, muons must be accelerated fairly rapidly for a neutrino fac-
tory or muon collider. Muon bunches tend to be large. Progress in ﬁxed ﬁeld, alternating
gradient (FFAG) lattices to meet this challenge is reviewed. FFAG magnets are naturally
wide; low momentum muons move from the low ﬁeld side of a gradient magnet to the
high ﬁeld side as they gain energy. This can be exploited to do double duty and allow
a large beam admittance without unduly increasing the magnetic ﬁeld volume. If the
amount of RF must be reduced to optimize cost, an FFAG ring can accommodate extra
orbits. I describe both scaling FFAGs in which the bends in each magnet are energy
independent and non-scaling FFAGs in which the bends in each magnet do vary with
muon energy. In all FFAG designs the sum of the bends in groups of magnets are con-
stant; otherwise orbits would not close. Ways of keeping the accelerating beam in phase
with the RF are described. Finally, a 1 MeV proof of principle scaling FFAG has been
built at KEK and began accelerating protons in June 2000 with a 1 kHz repetition rate.

Keywords: accelerator; muon; neutrino; black hole.

1. Introduction
Scaling FFAG rings were proposed independently a half century ago by Ohkawa,1
Symon,2 and Kolomensky.3 The Mid-Western Universities Research Association
(MURA) built both radial-sector (1957) and spiral-sector (1960) models and tested
them with electrons. However, the serious development of FFAGs ceased with the
ascendancy of ramping synchrotrons, which allowed smaller diameter, smaller bore
rings for a given energy and magnetic ﬁeld. Because the voltage needed to quickly
ramp synchrotrons 4 ﬁlled with wide bunches of low energy muons is rather large,
FFAGs have recently experienced a renaissance.5,6 The FFAG design permits mul-
tiple passages of muons though both RF cavities and magnet arcs for reduced cost.
One reason FFAG rings are of interest today is because they oﬀer economical
muon acceleration for a neutrino factory 7,8 or a muon collider.9 At a neutrino
factory accelerated muons are stored in a racetrack to produce neutrino beams
(µ− → e− νe νµ and µ+ → e+ νe νµ). Neutrino oscillations have been observed.10

Further exploration at a neutrino factory could reveal CP violation in the lepton
sector,11 and is particularly useful if the coupling between νe and ντ , θ13, is small.8
A muon collider can do s-channel scans to separate the H 0 and A0 Higgs doublet.12
Above the ILC’s 800 GeV there are a large array of supersymmetric particles that
might be produced,13 as well as mini black holes,14 if large extra dimensions exist.
Note that the energy resolution of a muon collider is not smeared by beamstrahlung.
A cyclotron has a large volume magnetic ﬁeld which is constant in time. Particle
orbits move from the center to the edge of the cyclotron as they accelerate. A
synchrotron has a small magnetic ﬁeld volume. The B ﬁeld increases with time.
Particle orbit radii do not change as a particle accelerates. An FFAG ring is in
between a cyclotron and a synchrotron in its design. As particles accelerate they
move a small distance in gradient magnets which can accommodate higher energy
orbits at slightly diﬀerent radii. FFAG magnetic ﬁelds are ﬁxed in time and their
volume is larger than a synchrotron but smaller than a cyclotron.

2. A Neutrino Factory Design using Two Non-Scaling FFAG Rings
The most recent neutrino factory design8 incorporates 5 → 10 and 10 → 20 GeV
non-scaling FFAG rings. Acceleration up to 5 GeV uses a linac and a dogbone
recycling linac.8,15 A layout appears in Fig. 1 and parameters in Table 1. The 20
GeV ring is almost ﬁve times larger than a synchrotron with 5.5 T magnets. The
ratio of focusing–to–bending in an FFAG ring is high. Normally resonances are a
problem in non-scaling FFAGs, but the fast muon acceleration cycle can prevent
them from building up as can highly symmetric lattice designs. Each cell uses a
FDF triplet of superconducting magnets as shown in Fig. 2. Much work has gone
into the lattice design to keep the beam size and hence the magnetic apertures
relatively small. The idea is to control cost by reducing the magnetic ﬁeld volume
and by using superconducting magnets with moderate ﬁelds.

Superconducting RF (ﬁxed 201 MHz, 10 MV/m) is used for acceleration. A

the same order as the phase diﬀerence just due to the muons increasing in speed
as shown in the last row of Table 1. Its hard to change the RF phase itself quickly.
An advantage of the non-scaling FFAG is the additional control over the physical
path length muons follow. Path lengths dominate speed increases in determining
muon phase with respect to the RF. Fig. 3 notes the parabolic time of ﬂight (TOF)
relation that can be achieved. Muons cross the RF crest three times during the
acceleration cycle. Staying closer to crest minimizes the amount and cost of RF
that is needed. In a scaling FFAG, TOF increases monotonically.

3. Scaling FFAG Rings Being Built in Japan

FFAGs are being built for muon phase rotation, radiation therapy, CT scanning,
and accelerator–driven sub–critical nuclear reactor operation in Japan. A 1 MeV
scaling FFAG with 8 DFD sectors has been built at KEK and has accelerated
protons with a 1 kHz repetition rate.5,17 A 150 MeV scaling FFAG with 12 DFD
sectors is nearing completion. Beam has been accelerated to 150 MeV. Orbits shift
from a radius of 4.4 to 5.5 m during the acceleration cycle. In these scaling FFAGs,
orbit shapes and magnet focal lengths are energy independent. See Fig. 2 of Ref. 5
for a nice drawing of particle paths in scaling and non-scaling FFAGs.

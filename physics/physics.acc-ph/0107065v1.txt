Renormalization Group Reduction of Non Integrable Hamiltonian
Systems

Plasma Physics Laboratory, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08543

Stephan I. Tzenov

Abstract

Based on the Renormalization Group method, a reduction of non integrable
multi-dimensional hamiltonian systems has been performed. The evolution equa-
tions for the slowly varying part of the angle-averaged phase space density, and
for the amplitudes of the angular modes have been derived. It has been shown
that these equations are precisely the Renormalization Group equations. As an
application of the approach developed, the modulational diﬀusion in one-and-a-
half degree of freedom dynamical system has been studied in detail.

1. Introduction

It is well-known that dynamical systems may exhibit irregular motion in certain regions of
phase space1,2. These regions diﬀer in size, from being considerably small, to occupying
large parts of phase space. This depends mostly on the strength of the perturbation, as well
as on the intrinsic characteristics of the system. For comparatively small perturbations the
regularity of the motion is expressed in the existence of adiabatic action invariants. In the
course of nonlinear interaction the action invariants vary within a certain range, prescribed
by the integrals of motion (if such exist). For chaotic systems some (or all) of the integrals of
motion are destroyed, causing speciﬁc trajectories to become extremely complicated. These
trajectories look random in their behavior, therefore it is natural to explore the statistical
properties of chaotic dynamical systems.

Much experimental and theoretical evidence3,4 of nonlinear eﬀects in the dynamics of
particles in accelerators and storage rings is available at present. An individual particle
propagating in an accelerator experiences growth of amplitude of betatron oscillations in a
plane transverse to the particle orbit, whenever a perturbing force acts on it. This force may
be of various origin, for instance high order multipole magnetic ﬁeld errors, space charge
forces, beam-beam interaction force, power supply ripple or other external and collective
forces. Therefore, the Hamiltonian governing the motion of a beam particle is far from
being integrable, and an irregular behavior of the beam is clearly observed, especially for a
large number of turns.

The idea to treat the evolution of chaotic dynamical systems in a statistical sense is
not new; many rigorous results related to the statistical properties of such systems can be
found in the book by Arnold and Avez5. Many of the details concerning the transport
phenomena in the space of adiabatic action invariants only are also well understood2. In
this aspect the results presented here are in a sense re-derivation of previously obtained ones
by means of a diﬀerent method. What is new however, is the approach followed to obtain
the diﬀusion properties in action variable space, as well as a new evolution equation for the
angle-dependent part of the phase space density. Furthermore, instead of the widely used
phenomenological method to derive the diﬀusion coeﬃcient (tensor), the procedure pursued
in the present paper is more consistent one, with a starting point the Liouville’s equation
for the phase space density.

We ﬁrst employ the Projection Operator method of Zwanzig6 to derive the equations for
the two parts of the phase space density: the averaged over the angle variables part F , and
the remainder G [see Eq. (2.10) in the next Section]. As expected, the two equations are
coupled. Next we extract the relevant long-time scale behavior embedded in the equations
for F and G by means of the Renormalization Group (RG) method7,8. It is remarkable, and
at the same time not surprising that the equations governing the long-time scale dynamics
are the Renormalization Group equations (RGEs). These are obtained in Section 4 through
renormalizing the perturbative solution of the equations for F and G [see Eqs. (2.22) and
(2.23) of Section 2]. Finally, in Section 5 one-dimensional example of a chaotic system is
considered to demonstrate the approach developed here.

2. Projection Operator Method

Single particle dynamics in cyclic accelerators and storage rings is most properly described by
the adiabatic action invariants (Courant-Snyder invariants9) and the canonically conjugate
to them angle variables. However, to be more general we consider here a dynamical system
with N degrees of freedom, governed by the Hamiltonian written in action-angle variables
(J , α) as

H(α, J ; θ) = H0(J ) + ǫV (α, J; θ),

where θ is the independent azimuthal variable (widely used in accelerator physics), playing
the role of time and J and α are N-dimensional vectors

J = (J1, J2, . . . , JN ),

α = (α1, α2, . . . , αN ).

Moreover H0(J ) is the integrable part of the Hamiltonian, ǫ is a formal small parameter,
while V (α, J ; θ) is the perturbation periodic in the angle variables

V (α, J ; θ) =

Vm(J ; θ) exp (im · α),

In what follows (in particular in Section 4) we assume that the nonlinearity coeﬃcients

The above equations comprise the the starting point in the analysis outlined in Section
4. We are primarily interested in the long-time evolution of the original system governed by
certain amplitude equations. These will turn out to be precisely the RG equations.

3. Renormalization Group Reduction of Hamilton’s Equations

Let us consider the solution of Hamilton’s equations of motion (2.4) for small perturbation
parameter ǫ. It is natural to introduce the perturbation expansion

αk = α(0)

k + ǫα(1)

k + ǫ2α(2)

k + · · · ,

Jk = J (0)

k + ǫJ (1)

k + ǫ2J (2)

k + · · · .

(3.1)

The lowest order perturbation equations have the trivial solution:

α(0)
k = ω0kθ + ϕk,

J (0)
k = Ak,

where Ak and ϕk are constant amplitude and phase, respectively. We write the ﬁrst order
perturbation equations as

and γ is a small real quantity added ad hoc in the denominators of the expressions (3.6) and
(3.7). The limit γ → 0 will be taken in the ﬁnal result.

As expected, in the second order perturbation solution (3.10) the ﬁrst and the second
terms are secular, because R(θ) = θ. To remove these secularities we follow the general
prescription of the RG method7,8. First, we select the slowly varying part of the perturba-
tion solution governing the long-time evolution of the system. Up to second order in the
perturbation parameter ǫ it consists of the constant zero order term Ak and the second
order secular terms. Next, we introduce the intermediate time τ , and in order to absorb the
diﬀerence τ = θ − (θ − τ ) we make the new renormalized amplitude Ak(τ ) dependent on
τ . Since the long-time solution thus constructed should not depend on τ its derivative with
respect to τ must be equal to zero. This also holds for τ = θ, so that ﬁnally

4. Renormalization Group Reduction of Liouville’s Equation

We consider the solution of Eqs. (2.22) and (2.23) for small ǫ by means of the RG method.
For that purpose we perform again the naive perturbation expansion

F = F (0) + ǫF (1) + ǫ2F (2) + · · · ,

Gn = G(0)

n + ǫG(1)

n + ǫ2G(2)

n + · · · ,

(4.1)

and substitute it in Eqs. (2.22) and (2.23). The lowest order perturbation equations have
the obvious solution

F (0) = F0(J ),

G(0)

n = Wn(J ) exp (−inkω0kθ).

We again assume that the modes Vn(J ; θ) are periodic in θ, so that they can be expanded
in a Fourier series (3.4). If the original system (2.1) exhibits primary resonances of the form
(3.5) in the case when ω0k does not depend on the action variables, we can solve the ﬁrst
order perturbation equations (4.3) and (4.4). The result is as follows:

(4.17)

The RG equation (4.16) is a Fokker-Planck equation describing the diﬀusion of the
adiabatic action invariant. It has been derived previously by many authors (see e.g. the
book by Lichtenberg and Lieberman2 and the references therein). It is important to note that
our derivation does not require the initial assumption concerning the fast stochastization
of the angle variable. The fact that the latter is indeed a stochastic variable is clearly
visible from the second RG equation (4.17), governing the slow amplitude evolution of the
angle-dependent part of the phase space density. Nevertheless it looks complicated, its most
important feature is that equations for the amplitudes of diﬀerent modes are decoupled. In
the case of isolated nonlinear resonance Eq. (4.17) acquires a very simple form as will be
shown in the next Section.

5. Modulational Diﬀusion

As an example to demonstrate the theory developed in previous sections, we consider the
simplest example of one-and-a-half degree of freedom dynamical system exhibiting chaotic
motion

H0(J) = λJ + Hs(J),

V (α, J; θ) = V (J) cos (α + ξ sin νθ).

(5.1)

The Hamiltonian (5.1), written in resonant canonical variables describes an isolated nonlin-
ear resonance of one-dimensional betatron motion of particles in an accelerator with mod-
ulated resonant phase (or modulated linear betatron tune). The modulation may come
from various sources: ripple in the power supply of quadrupole magnets, synchro-betatron
coupling or ground motion. The resonance detuning λ deﬁnes the distance from the reso-
nance, Ξ is the amplitude of modulation of the linear betatron tune and ν is the modulation
frequency, where ξ = Ξ/ν. Without loss of generality we consider ξ positive. Since

has been plotted as a function of the ratio between the amplitude and the frequency of
the modulation. Three typical regimes corresponding to diﬀerent values of λ/Ξ used as a
control parameter have been chosen. In the ﬁrst one depicted in Figure 1 we have taken
the resonance detuning twice as large as the amplitude of the modulation (λ = 2Ξ). In this
case there is no crossing of the main resonance described by the Hamiltonian (5.1) and the
diﬀusion coeﬃcient decreases very rapidly after reaching its maximum value at ξ = 0.25.
The cases of periodic resonance crossings for λ = Ξ and λ = Ξ/2 are shown in Figure 2 and
Figure 3, respectively.

6. Concluding Remarks

In the present paper we apply the Renormalization Group method to the reduction of non
integrable multi-dimensional Hamiltonian systems. The notion of reduction is used here in
the sense of slow, long-time behavior, that survives appropriate averaging and/or factorizing
of rapidly oscillating contributions to the dynamics of the system.

As a result of the investigation performed we have derived evolution equations for the
slowly varying part of the angle-averaged phase space density, and for the amplitudes of

11

the angular modes. It has been shown that these equations are the Renormalization Group
equations.

The case of a one-dimensional isolated nonlinear resonance with a resonant phase (or
linear unperturbed tune) subjected to periodic modulation has been studied in detail. The
coeﬃcient of modulational diﬀusion, as well as the exponential growth increment of the
amplitudes of angular modes have been obtained in explicit form.

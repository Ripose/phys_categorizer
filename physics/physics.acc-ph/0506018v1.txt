are not considered. The beam structure in phase space are consedered and envelope
near the focusing spot and intensity proﬁle are derived.

1 Introduction

∼

When a high energy particle with a momentum P are captured in a channel-
ing motion of bent crystal, the equivalent magnetic ﬁeld acting on the particle
P/(0.3R), where R is a curvature radius of the bent
can be estimated as
crystal [1,2]. For the momentums P & 300GeV /c and radius R ∼ 1m the
equivalent magnetic ﬁeld can reach the values & 1000 tesla. This phenomena
has been extensively investigated for a beam deﬂection, splitting, extraction,
and spin precession measurements[2,3,4]. The ﬁrst experiment of the bent
channeling[5] conﬁrmed that the bent crystal could also be used for construct-
ing a focusing element with extremely short focal length and small focal spot.
Several crystal devices for focusing were suggested[6,7,8,9], but the successful
experiments[10,11] were done with the crystal having a special shape drawn
in Fig. 1(a). This is a regular bent crystal with the output face carved in such
a way that the tangent lines to the planar channels on that face are converged
to a focal point. With these conditions, the center points of the channels on
the output face of the crystal constitute a cylindrical surface with diameter
D, greater than curvature radii of bending, D
Rmin. The
estimations[12] show that the size of smallest focal spot is proportional to the

tensity at the focal spot, and the crystal geometry is proposed where the focal
parameters can reach the extreme values.

In this article we present the detail theory of the focusing in bent crystals
using the statistical mechanics. The quantum mechanical eﬀects for focusing
and aberration are not considered here.

2 The model potential of focusing by bent crystal

We consider the classical model of channeling [13] with a continuous tem-
perature dependent planar potential, when ions are captured into channel-
ing trajectories and directed along the bent atomic channels. Similar consid-
erations in bent crystals without boundary conditions were done by many
authors [14,15,16,17,4] and based on the assumption that curvatures of crys-
talline structure are small and bent plane locally looks like ﬂat surface. In local
coordinate system the model of continuous straight planar potential [13] can
be apply and describe the most important features of bent channeling [4]. If
each plane has a constant curvature, it is convenient to use a polar coordinate
system (ρ, ϕ) with a center located at the point O (see Fig. 1(a))and direction
(ρ, ϕ = 0) tangent to the cylindrical surface. In such coordinate system the
crystal potential for the bent channeling in Moliere’s approximation [18,19,20]
with a diﬀerent length of the channels can be described as following

denote the enter and exit surfaces of the nth bent plane. Thus, the end cylin-
drical surface of the crystal lies in the range ϕ0 < ϕ < ϕmax. Others notations
can be found in Fig. 1. Although Moliere’s approximation (2) for isolated
plane has a simple analytical form, it can not directly be implemented for
calculation of the channeling trajectory, because the channel potential is su-
perposed from several neighboring planes. However, if we consider an inﬁnite
crystal at ﬁxed temperature, this superposition can be ﬁtted by a polyno-
mial of suitable order. The estimations can be easily received by an harmonic
approximation [4], which coincides with Moliere’s approximation on the crys-
talline planes and on centers of the channels. By involving 10 crystalline planes
located far away from boundaries (K >> 1), the parabolic potential can be
ﬁtted to the Moliere’s approximation with the following parameters:

One can extend this model to the crystalline potential near the boundaries
ignoring the fact that potential of the ﬁrst several subsurface channels becomes
slightly asymmetric (see Fig. 2). Outside the crystal, the potential can also
be ﬁtted by half part of parabola, for example, with a condition that on the
boundary plane the potential is continuous and the parabola intersects the
Moliere’s potential at the value Umin/2. Because other planes give a small
contribution to the surface potential, the distance of this intersection from
boundary plane is very close to dp/2. The resulting system of two equations,

may happen for extreme focusing with shortest focal length [12] (see also

crosses the boundaries of the crystal. The phase curves of the particles are de-

the normal channels, particle may also have a surface channel in which it moves
sequentially reﬂecting from a surface plane. Note that this surface channel is much
wider than the crystal channel and might play an important role for focusing in
extreme conditions [12].

The Hamiltonian (10) of the system (13) has a cylindrical symmetry, therefore
the angular momentum of the particle pϕ is conserved. The tangent momentum
of particle pϕ/ρ along the curved channel is not exactly conserved, but taking
into account that the channeling particle can not move further than dp/2 from
the center line of the channel and dp/Rn ≪
1, the tangent momentum of
particles pt = pϕ/ρ = mρ ˙ϕγ and tangent velocity vt = ρ ˙ϕ = pt/(mγ) are
conserved with high accuracy. We also make the following

Note that parameter ϕ in Eq. (11,13,16) means only the piecewise character
of potential (1, 8), which has discontinuity at the front and end surfaces of
the each channel. The normal derivative of the potential ∂Ub
c(ρ, ϕ)/∂ϕ on
these surfaces does not exist. Of course, the real atomic potential is smooth
function on the surface. Its derivative rendering the normal force causes an
impulse in normal linear momentum when the particles cross these surfaces.
The linear momentum tangent to the front and end surfaces of the channels
does not change as particle passes the boundary of the crystal, but angular
momentum may slightly change due to force acting perpendicular to these
surfaces. Thus, the boundary conditions for Eq.( 11,13-16) on front surface of
the crystal, ϕ = ϕmin, can be presented in the form

−

ρo = ρi,

pρo = pρi,

pϕo = pϕi + ∆p,

(17)

where (ρo, pρo, pϕo), (ρi, pρi, pϕi) denote the radial coordinate, linear tangent
and angular momenta on the particle for ϕ

where e−→E is electric ﬁeld acting upon the ion with charge e inside the crystal,
St(f ) is a collision integral, which plays an important role in establishing
the equilibrium states and dechanneling inside the crystal. Outside the crystal
St(f ) and e−→E vanish and the Boltzmann equation reduces to particular simple
form

Consider 2-D geometry for plane channeling (Fig. (1a)). The particle beam has
an initial distribution fin(x, zin(x), vx, vz) on the entrance of the crystal surface
z = zin(x) and some distribution fout(x, zout(x), vx, vz) formed by channeling
process on the end face of the crystal z = zout(x). We use Cartesian coordinate
system instead of the cylindrical coordinates used in Sec.2,3 and assume that
all coordinates and their conjugate momentums or velocities are dimensionless.
Behind the crystal the Eq. (29) becomes

As a simple model, consider single microchannel, say microchannel with output

The same treatment can easily be extended to each microchannel if we take
proper Cartesian coordinate system (´x, ´z) with origin at the center of this
channel on the end face of the crystal and with OX axis directed to the focus
(see Fig.1b). The coordinate system for n channel is connected to Cartesian

For the distribution function (35) we have also to calculate v´xn and v´zn which

Note that the distribution in longitudinal space of the velocities is invariant
under the changes of (42), i.e. h(vz) = h(v´zn). Substituting in the equation
(40) the values of the (´xn, ´zn, v´xn, v´zn) given by formulas (41), (42), we get the
equation for distribution functions for all channels in coordinates (x, z, vx, vz)

where N = dc/dp - number of plane channels of crystal. If we substitute
z = Fmax in (44), we can get the distribution function in a focal plane of the
phase space. The main features of this distribution can be seen in Fig.5. All
ellipse have the same area as mentioned above. The upper ellipse is shaped by
microbeam from channel 0. It has greater x-size because the larger distance
from the output channel to the focal point. The bottom ellipse is related to

13

the last microbeam. It has a smallest deformation. The centers of the ellipses
in focal plane are located on the Vx-axis at the points

For an experiment measurements, it is important to ﬁnd the intensity proﬁle
at the focal spot. It can be received by the integrating Eq.(44) over vx:

fout(x, Fmax) =

fout,n(x, Fmax, vx, vz)dvxdvz.

Note that in order to calculate the envelope of the beam in phase space, we
may take a derivative of microbeam surface with respect to n considering
variable n as continuous and eliminate n from two equations

where Φn(x, z, vx, vz) = 0 is the equation of the microbeam surface in phase
space. We can substitute z for Fmax (see Eq.(39)) in equations (48), so getting

Φn(x, z, vx, vz) = 0,
∂Φn(x, z, vx, vz)
∂n

= 0,

Φn(x, Fmax, vx, vz) = 0,

5 Conclusion

−

In conclusion, we describe some possible limitations of focusing which can sub-
stantially reduce the focusing eﬀect. At small angles (π/2
β) the smoothness
of the cylindrical surface is of great importance, the amorphous layer on that
surface must be as thin as possible, and all adjacent channels must constitute
the staircase with step widths equals to the interplaner space. Of course, it
is not always possible and deviation caused by surface roughness or mosaic
blocks with widths about the length of channeling oscillation will produce a
broadening of the focal spot and greatly decrease the peak intensity. Other well
known source of abberation to be considered for focusing is negative Gaussian
curvature of bent crystals (anticlastic eﬀect). The asymmetry of centripetal
dechanneling in bent channels [3,4] is a strong source of asymmetry in focal
spot. There is also a possibility of asymmetry in coherent transitional scatter-
ing when the particles come out with small angles and move some short period
of time in semichannel. For long crystal dechanneling, and the case with the
minimum possible focal distance [12] where the focal spot lies almost on the
tip of the crystal it is critical.

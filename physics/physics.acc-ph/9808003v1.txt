Abstract

A novel scheme is presented for production of a thin (< 1 mm) uniform vapor
layer over a large surface area (> 100 cm2) by pulsed laser ablation of a solid surface.

Instead of dispersing the laser energy uniformly over the surface, a modiﬁed Fabry-

Perot interferometer is employed to concentrate the laser energy in very narrow

closely-spaced concentric rings. This approach may be optimized to minimum total

laser energy for the desired vapor density. Furthermore, since the vapor is produced

from a small fraction of the total surface area, the local ablation depth is large,

which minimized the fraction of surface contamination in the vapor.

Key words: laser evaporation, thin gas layer formation.

1 Introduction

In principle, an ideal plasma-based ion source for an ion beam would provide a

perfectly uniform, very thin layer of fully ionized plasma with a single ion species, at a

temperature low enough to introduce negligible beam divergence. For magnetically insu-

lated ion diodes for light-ion inertial fusion drivers, these criteria in practice would require
a plasma layer less than 1 mm thick, with areal density greater than 1015 cm−2, uniform to
within 10% to prevent unacceptable perturbation of the plasma surface smoothness caus-

ing beam divergence, and ion temperature below 50 eV. Pulsed-laser ablation of vapor

from a surface is one possible means of providing a gas layer to form such a plasma, before

application of the high-voltage pulse. This gas layer can be ionized either by near-surface

discharge in the applied ﬁeld, or in advance, by means of photoresonance laser ionization

of the vapor [1]. By this technique one could obtain space-charge-limited current from

all the anode plasma surface and, consequently, to eliminate additional sources of the ion

beam divergence [2].

Work at Sandia National Laboratories [3] has produced anode vapor layers in this

way, by dispersing laser energy over the desired anode surface area. High uniformity and

purity is very diﬃcult to achieve by this method, especially since the areal density of
vapor desired is rather small, but the area is large (> 100 cm2), requiring the laser energy

to be dispersed uniformly to an energy density not far above the threshold for ablation, a

regime in which vapor production is a strong function of laser energy density and surface

contaminants may dominate vapor production.

In this paper we investigate an alternative scheme in which the laser is intentionally

concentrated into a series of concentric narrow rings. Vapor is produced in these rings,

which are closely enough spaced (

0.5 mm) that the ablated clouds merge to an ade-

quately uniform layer of 0.5 mm thickness. The concentration allows the evaporation to

∼

be done at a higher, optimum power density for a particular laser and anode material,

so that the overall laser energy is minimized (see [4, 5]). In addition, for a given total

amount of vapor, the depth of ablation in the rings is larger than for uniform illumination

by the ratio of total area to ring area, so surface contaminants to bulk material ratio could

be much less in comparison with a case of the disperse radiation distribution at a lower

power density.

2 Principle of operation

The scheme of the concentrator is shown in Fig.1. The concentrator is based on a

Fabry-Perot interferometer. A laser beam is introduced by an input focusing lens into the

2

interferometer through a small hole in the ﬁrst mirror. The output lens focuses the light

after the interferometer to produce concentric thin rings at the target surface. Most of

the energy of the laser concentrates in these rings on the surface, except only the central

part of the beam which is lost by reﬂection back through the hole. The device including

the input lens, the interferometer, and the output lens we will refer to as a concentrator.

The power density in the narrow rings is chosen to be high enough to evaporate surface

material eﬃciently. The amount of material evaporated per unit laser energy peaks at a

particular optimum value. If this value is chosen for the rings of illumination, a desired

area-averaged vapor density is produced with minimum laser energy.

We will use the following terms: r1, r2 are reﬂection coeﬃcients for ﬁrst and second
r);

100%, r2 < 100%); τ1, τ2 are transmission coeﬃcients (deﬁned as τ = 1

mirrors (r1 ≃
λ is the wavelength of laser generation, ∆ is the distance between mirrors.

Consider a ray of the laser beam focused by the input lens with intensity I0 on the
input of the concentrator and angle θ to the axis. The intensity of this ray behind the back

mirror is τ2I0. The intensity of the reﬂected part of the ray after the ﬁrst reﬂection from
the front mirror and passing through the back mirror is r2r1τ2I0, and after kth reﬂection
– (r2r1)kτ2I0. These rays interfere at the focal plane of the output lens. The electric ﬁeld

For the distribution of laser radiation over the target surface “intensities” I and

I0 in the above written formulae have to be replaced by the radiation power densities
F = dP/dS and F0 = dP0/dS, which are functions of radius ρ and azimuthal angle ψ on
the target (dS = ρdρdψ). In contrast to a conventional Fabry-Perot interferometer, where

the power density cannot be higher then the initial power density, for the concentrator

the power density in the peaks can be much higher than the incident power density. For
example, if τ1 = 0 and τ2 = 0.04, Fmax = 100F0, e.g. the concentrator multiplies the peak
power density one hundred times.

There may be substantial advantages of such an energy distribution for surface gas

layer production. The maximum intensity for all the rings would be equal if the initial

laser beam is uniform, and the averaged power density over any area of dimension larger

than the ring spacing is equal to < F >= F0, so that for F0 =const the distribution
of averaged power density from the concentrator would be constant. The multiplication

factor K = 4/τ2 (if τ1 = 0) gives not only the power density multiplication in the rings
but also the ratio of total area to the illuminated ring area.

3 Vapor cloud production: a practical example

The concentrator described can be applied to thin vapor cloud production near an

anode surface of ion accelerator. Figure 2 shows an example of using of the concentrator

in a magnetically insulated ion diode. The upper diagram shows direct illumination of

the anode for simplicity, while the lower diagram shows a way to remove the concentrator

from the ion beam path.

Let us introduce the parameters that must be involved in the calculation process.

4

R1, R2 are the inner and outer radii of the anode, δR2 is the distance between illuminated
rings on anode surface, Fopt is power density needed to evaporate the anode material.
The parameters of the concentrator are: f1, f2, the foci of the input and output lenses of
the concentrator; α, β, the angles of the input rays that are directed by the output lens

to the R2 and R1 radii; R the radius of the interferometer; ∆, the distance between the
mirrors of the interferometer; l, the distance between the output mirror and the focus of

the input lens; h, the radius of the hole; K the multiplying factor; P , the energy density

on the output mirror surface. The laser parameters are: λ, the generation wavelength;

δλ, the bandwidth of laser generation; t, the pulse duration; Q, the pulse energy.

We now estimate the parameters needed for realizing the scheme. We choose the

COBRA ion diode [6] as an example. For this diode, R1 = 7.2 cm, R2 = 9.5 cm. We
desire δR2 = 0.05 cm, for adequate uniformity of the vapor layer on a distance 0.05 cm
from the anode surface. For evaporation by 10 ns laser pulse of an aluminium target
we choose Fmax = F Al
230 MW/cm2 [7], for optimum eﬃciency of vapor production.
Experiments on vapor cloud production (see [8]) show that for every target there is a

opt ≃

range near an optimal power density where it is possible to obtain low-ionized cold vapors

without the laser-induced breakdown. It is signiﬁcant also that near this value of power

density the amount of evaporated material and the velocity of vapor boundary are only

weakly dependent on power density [9]. Thus the vapor layer could be more uniform than

the initial laser power density F0. We will use the value f2 = 1.5 m for the output lens
focus, which would work in the conﬁguration of Fig.2a for the present COBRA diode.

Fig.2b shows a possible arrangement in a focusing diode geometry. The value of f2 may
be adjusted to avoid interference of optical elements with the ion beam. We assume a

ruby laser with wavelength 694.3 nm. For deﬁniteness we put K = 100, but this ﬁgure

might be varied.

The value δR2 deﬁnes the distance between mirrors. Actually, the maxima of power
density (6) correspond to the zeros of sin(ϕ/2). So two nearby maxima diﬀer by angle δθ

The main critical parameter of the concentrator is the energy density in the center

This value is not too high, but the local energy density can be 3 times more due to

of such quality are available [10].

The total energy of laser can be calculated from the formula Q = F Al

2K −1 = 6.5
J. Only 40% of the energy is used in the evaporation, because of noncorrespondence of

the solid circular laser beam and the hollow annular anode surface. It is more eﬃcient to

use an annular laser beam. A beam with such a structure can be produced by a Nd laser

with nonstable resonator. Use of 1.06 µm light leads to an increase of concentrator size

∆ = 9.15 cm, R = 8 cm, h = 0.5 cm. However, the energy

J/cm2. To use the concentrator in such a regime would require a mirror that would not
damaged by the energy density 3P = 20 J/cm2. This value is over the damage threshold

for the best mirror coatings [10]. But it is possible that the mirror coating can withstand
this energy density because averaged energy density is less 12 J/cm2, and the value above

damage threshold is reached only in very thin rings of 20λ of thickness that would provide

fast heat diﬀusion over the surface due to thermal conductivity.

4 Conclusion

The production of a very uniform, thin vapor layer above a solid surface by laser

ablation is a diﬃcult problem. We have suggested a method of distributing laser energy

in a series of narrow, high intensity rings that could be advantageous in producing vapor

eﬃciently, and, probably, with minimum sensitivity to surface contaminants and laser

intensity variation. If this concentrated vapor production can be allowed to expand and

merge into a uniform layer, these advantages might be realized. We leave aside of this

paper consideration of the problem of possible small-scale non-uniformity of the gas layer

produced with the concentrator as well possible anode plasma instability. Obviously,

at ﬁrst the technique suggested has to be veriﬁed experimentally, and the anode layer

parameters must be measured.

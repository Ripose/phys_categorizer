We illustrate the use of the invariant spin ﬁeld for describing permissi-
ble equilibrium spin distributions in high energy spin polarised proton
beams.

1 A problem and its solution

Following the successful attainment of longitudinal e± polarisation in HERA (Article
II) it is natural to consider whether it would be possible to complement the polarised
e± with 820GeV polarised protons [1, 2].

As pointed out in Article I, a stored polarised proton beam can only be obtained
by injecting and then accelerating a prepolarised beam provided by a suitable source.
However, I comment on another concept in the Appendix.

A major obstacle to reaching high energy with the polarisation intact is that the
spins must negotiate groups of spin–orbit resonances every 523MeV (Article I) since
the spin tune is approximately proportional to the energy.

However, this problem can be ameliorated by the inclusion of Siberian Snakes
[3, 4]. These are magnet systems which rotate spins by 180 degrees around an axis in
the horizontal plane independently of the energy of the particle. By the installation
of suitable combinations of snakes, the spin tune νspin can be ﬁxed at one half and
then by suitable choice of orbital tunes, resonances can be avoided at all energies,
assuming that the dependence of spin tune on synchrobeta amplitude is weak (Article
I).

Tracking simulations show that even with snakes, preservation of polarisation up
to high energy is nontrivial. For example a 1 milliradian orbit deﬂection at 820 GeV
causes a 90 degree spin rotation (Article I, Eq. (4)). Thus one should check ﬁrst
whether the spin distribution permitted by the requirement of equilibrium at a chosen
high energy would be acceptable. There would be no point in trying to accelerate
if the answer were negative. Moreover, to arrive at an answer we have the ideal
tool at hand, namely the invariant spin ﬁeld introduced in Article I. The measure for
acceptability is the deviation of ˆn from ˆn0 averaged across phase space. If the average
deviation were, say, 60 degrees, then even with | ~Peq(~u; s)| = 1 at each point in phase
space, a polarimeter would only record about 50% polarisation. Thus the optic and
ring layout must be chosen so that the deviation is minimised. The invariant spin

ﬁeld can be calculated using the numerical technique ‘stroboscopic averaging’ of the
computer code SPRINT [5] b.

Examples of the invariant spin ﬁeld for a HERA proton optic with a suitable
snake layout are shown in the ﬁgures. In this simulation the protons only execute
integrable vertical betatron motion. Each ﬁgure shows the locus, on the surface of a
sphere, of the tip of the ˆn vector ‘attached’ to its phase space ellipse at an interaction
point on the ring where ˆn0 is vertical. The parameters are shown in the captions. An
emittance of 4π mm mrad corresponds to ‘1-σ’. The energy 800 GeV lies well below

a resonance structure that survives even in the presence of snakes and 802 GeV is just
below this structure. For particles at 1-σ the spin ﬁeld is well aligned at 800 GeV .
At 4-σ it has opened well beyond 90 degrees at some phases. At 802 GeV the 1-σ
locus deviates by more than 30 degrees from ˆn0 at some orbital phases and at 4-σ
the ﬁeld is almost isotropic! In all four cases the locii are closed as required by the
periodicity condition ˆn(~u; s) = ˆn(~u; s + C) (Article I).

A distribution of spins aligned along an invariant spin ﬁeld is the ideal starting
point for long term tracking studies of spin stability at ﬁxed energy since deviations
from equilibrium are then easy to discern.

bThe new version of the SODOM algorithm [6] gives equivalent results. See Article I.

Appendix

It has been suggested that by using Stern–Gerlach (SG) forces to drive coherent syn-
chrobeta motion and thereby separate particle bunches into ‘spin–up’ and ‘spin–down’
parts, a proton beam could eﬀectively be polarised [7]. The scheme using transverse
SG forces requires running close to spin–orbit resonance but ﬁgure 2 illustrates that
at high amplitude spin directions become isotropic so that the SG eﬀect would av-
erage away. In any case the basic scheme might fail as a result of conservation laws
[8, 9, 10]. The longitudinal SG eﬀect [7] would be subject to mixing due to synchrotron
oscillation unless some very special means were found to prevent it. Moreover, the
longitudinal SG force is a total time derivative of a function of the ﬁelds and could
integrate to zero [11, 12, 13, 14].

Hamiltonian Formalism for Solving the Vlasov-Poisson Equations
and Its Applications to Periodic Focusing Systems and the
Coherent Beam-Beam Interaction

Stephan I. Tzenov and Ronald C. Davidson

Abstract

A Hamiltonian approach to the solution of the Vlasov-Poisson equations has

been developed. Based on a nonlinear canonical transformation, the rapidly os-

cillating terms in the original Hamiltonian are transformed away, yielding a new

Hamiltonian that contains slowly varying terms only. The formalism has been

applied to the dynamics of an intense beam propagating through a periodic fo-

cusing lattice, and to the coherent beam-beam interaction. A stationary solution

to the transformed Vlasov equation has been obtained.

Submitted to the Physical Review Special Topics – Accelerators and Beams

1. INTRODUCTION

The evolution of charged particle beams in accelerators and storage rings can often be

described by the Vlasov-Maxwell equations1,2. At high energies the discrete-particle collision

term3 comprises a small correction to the dynamics and can be neglected. Radiation eﬀects

at suﬃciently high energies for leptons can be a signiﬁcant feature of the dynamics, and

should normally be included in the model under consideration.

The Vlasov-Maxwell equations constitute a considerable simpliﬁcation in the description

of charged particle beam propagation. Nonetheless there are only a few cases that are

tractable analytically1,2. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to develop a systematic

perturbation approach, able to provide satisfactory results in a wide variety of cases of

physical interest.

Particle beams are subject to external forces that are often rapidly oscillating, such as

quadrupolar focusing forces, RF ﬁelds, etc. In addition, the collective self-ﬁeld excitations

can be rapidly oscillating as well. A typical example is a colliding-beam storage ring device,

where the evolution of each beam is strongly aﬀected by the electromagnetic force produced
by the counter-propagating beam4–6. The beam-beam kick each beam experiences is local-

ized only in a small region around the interaction point, and is periodic with a period of one

turn.

In this and other important applications, one is primarily interested in the long-time

behavior of the beam, thus discarding the fast processes on time scales of order the period

of the rapid oscillations. To extract the relevant information, an eﬃcient method of aver-

aging is developed in Sec. 2. Unlike the standard canonical perturbation technique7,8, the

approach used here is carried out in a “mixed” phase space (old coordinates and new canon-

ical momenta)9, which is simpler and more eﬃcient in a computational sense.

It should

be pointed out that the formalism developed here is strictly speaking non-canonical and in

general does not provide complete elimination of fast oscillating terms in the transformed

Vlasov equation in the mixed variables. Nevertheless, such an elimination can be performed

2

in the new Hamiltonian in the mixed variables. Moreover, if the distribution function is

assumed to be an arbitrary function of the new time-independent Hamiltonian, it is a sta-

tionary solution of the nonlinear Vlasov equation in the mixed variables. The canonical

perturbation method developed in this paper is further applied to intense beam propagation

in a periodic focusing structure (Sec. 3) and to the coherent beam-beam interaction (Secs.

4 and 5). A coupled set of nonlinear integral equations for the equilibrium beam densities

is derived.

To summarize, the eﬀectiveness of the Hamiltonian formalism developed in the present

paper is demonstrated in two particular examples. In the ﬁrst example discussed in Sec.

3, the short-scale dynamics is contained in the external focusing force acting on the beam,

while an essential feature of the coherent beam-beam interaction treated in Secs. 4 and 5 is

the relatively fast variation of the collective interaction between the colliding beams. The

simplicity in applying the Hamiltonian averaging technique is embedded in the use of mixed

canonical variables. Instead of expanding the generating function and the new Hamiltonian

in terms of the new canonical coordinates and momenta7,8 one has to simply solve the

Hamilton-Jacobi equations order by order. It should be emphasized that the mixed variable

Hamiltonian formalism can be used to derive amplitude equations, describing processes of

formation of patterns and coherent structures in a number of plasma and beam systems in

which collective processes are important.

2. THE HAMILTONIAN FORMALISM

We consider a N-dimensional dynamical system, described by the canonical conjugate pair

of vector variables (q, p) with components

q = (q1, q2, . . . , qN ),

p = (p1, p2, . . . , pN ).

(1)

The Vlasov equation for the distribution function f (q, p; t) can be expressed as

3

+ [f, H]q,p = 0,

∂f
∂t

where

[F, G]q,p =

∂F
∂qi

∂G
∂pi −

∂F
∂pi

∂G
∂qi

is the Poisson bracket, H(q, p; t) is the Hamiltonian of the system, and summation over

repeated indices is implied. Next we deﬁne a canonical transformation via the generating

function of the second type according to

S = S(q, P; t),

and assume that the Hessian matrix

Hij(q, P; t) =

∂2S
∂qi∂Pj

c
of the generating function S(q, P; t) is non-degenerate, i.e.,

This implies that the inverse matrix

−1
ij exists. The new canonical variables (Q, P) are

deﬁned by the canonical transformation as

det

= 0.

Hij

pi =

Qi =

.

We also introduce the distribution function deﬁned in terms of the new canonical coor-

dinates (Q, P) and the mixed pair of canonical variables (q, P) according to

f0(Q, P; t) = f (q(Q, P; t), p(Q, P; t); t),

F0(q, P; t) = f (q, p(q, P; t); t).

In particular, in Eq.

(8) the old canonical variables are expressed in terms of the new

ones, which is ensured by the implicit function theorem, provided the relation (6) holds. As

far as the function F0(q, P; t) is concerned, we simply replace the old momentum p by its

counterpart taken from the ﬁrst of Eqs. (7). Because

Diﬀerentiation of Eq. (7) with respect to time t, keeping the old variables (q, p) ﬁxed, yields

Our goal is to express the Vlasov equation (2) in terms of the mixed variables (q, P).

It is useful to compute the unperturbed betatron tunes νx,z in terms of averages over

the focusing ﬁeld-strengths. For a Hamiltonian system governed by a quadratic form in

the canonical variables of the type in Eq.

It is evident from Eqs. (68) and (71), that the Hamiltonian averaging technique developed

here represents a powerful formalism for evaluating the betatron tunes in terms of averages

over the focusing ﬁeld strength.

4. COHERENT BEAM-BEAM INTERACTION

As a second application of the Hamiltonian formalism developed in Sec. 2, we study here

the evolution of two counter-propagating beams, nonlinearly coupled by the electromagnetic

interaction between the beams at collision. For simplicity, we consider one-dimensional

motion in the vertical (q) direction, described by the nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson equations

Moreover, (k = 1, 2) labels the beam, fk(q, p; θ) is the distribution function, θ is the az-

imuthal angle, and νk is the betatron frequency in vertical direction. In addition, R is the

mean machine radius, re is the classical electron radius, N1,2 is the total number of par-

ticles in either beam, Vk(q; θ) is the normalized beam-beam potential, β∗

kq is the vertical

beta-function at the interaction point, and Lkx is the horizontal dimension of the beam

ribbon12.

Our goal is to determine a canonical transformation such that the new Hamiltonian is

time-independent. As a consequence, the stationary solution of the Vlasov equation (21) is

expressed as a function of the new Hamiltonian. Following the procedure outlined in the

Sec. 2 we transform Eqs. (74) – (76) according to

where ǫ is again a formal small parameter, which will be set equal to unity at the end of the

The eﬀectiveness of the Hamiltonian formalism developed in the present paper has been

demonstrated in two particular examples.

In the ﬁrst example discussed in the previous

section, the short-scale dynamics is contained in the external focusing force acting on the

beam, while an essential feature of the coherent beam-beam interaction treated above is the

relatively fast variation of the collective interaction between the two colliding beams. The

simplicity in applying the Hamiltonian averaging technique is embedded in the use of mixed

canonical variables. Instead of expanding the generating function and the new Hamiltonian

in terms of the new canonical coordinates and momenta7,8 one has to simply solve the

Hamilton-Jacobi equations order by order. It should be pointed out that the mixed variable

Hamiltonian formalism can be used to derive amplitude equations, describing processes of

formation of patterns and coherent structures in a number of plasma and beam systems in

which collective processes are important.

The inequality in Eq. (131) has been obtained under the condition that both solutions in

Eq. (130) are positive. This case corresponds to the so-called “ﬂip-ﬂop” state17 of the two

colliding beams, which is a bifurcated state better to be avoided.

6. CONCLUSIONS

We have developed a systematic canonical perturbation approach that removes rapidly os-

cillating terms in Hamiltonians of quite general form. The essential feature of this approach

is the use of mixed canonical variables. For this purpose the Vlasov-Poisson equations are

transformed to mixed canonical variables, and an appropriate perturbation scheme is chosen

to obtain the equilibrium phase space density. It is worthwhile to note that the perturbation

expansion outlined in the preceding section can be carried out to arbitrary order, although

higher-order calculations become very tedious.

In conclusion, it is evident from the present analysis that the Hamiltonian averaging

technique developed here represents a powerful formalism with applications ranging from

beam propagation through a periodic focusing lattice (Sec. 3) to coherent beam-beam

interaction (Secs. 4 and 5). For example, in the application to the coherent beam-beam

interaction, the rapidly oscillating terms due to the periodic beam-beam kicks have been

21

averaged away, leading to a new time-independent Hamiltonian (Sec. 4). Furthermore,

the equilibrium distribution functions have been obtained as a general function of the new

Hamiltonian, and coupled set of integral equations for the beam densities has been obtained

(Sec. 5). An intriguing feature of the analysis in Sec. 5 is the derivation of a condition for

existence of the so-called “ﬂip-ﬂop” state17 of the two colliding beams, which is a bifurcated

state better to be avoided in experimental applications.

We reiterate that the formalism developed here is strictly speaking non-canonical and in

general does not provide complete elimination of fast oscillating terms in the transformed

Vlasov equation in the mixed variables. Nevertheless, such an elimination can be performed

in the new Hamiltonian in the mixed variables. Moreover, if the distribution function is

assumed to be an arbitrary function of the new time-independent Hamiltonian, it is a sta-

tionary solution of the nonlinear Vlasov equation in the mixed variables.

Finally, we reiterate that the mixed variable Hamiltonian formalism developed in the

present analysis can be used to derive amplitude equations, describing processes of formation

of patterns and coherent structures in a number of plasma and beam systems in which

collective processes are important.

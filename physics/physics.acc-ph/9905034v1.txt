Abstract

An interpretation of the the “halo problem” in accelerators based on
quantum-like diﬀraction is given. Comparison between this approach and
the others based on classical mechanics equations is discussed

Keywords: Beam Physics, Quantum-like, Beam halo, Beam Losses, Stochasticity.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recently the description of the dynamical evolution of high density beams by using the
collective models, has become more and more popular. A way of developing this point of
view is the quantum-like approach [1] where one considers a time-dependent Schr¨odinger
equation, in both the usual linear and the less usual nonlinear forms, as a ﬂuid equation
for the whole beam. In this case the squared modulus of the wave function (named beam
wave function) gives the distribution function of the particles in space at a certain time [2].
The Schr¨odinger equation may be taken in one or more spacial dimensions according to the
particular physical problem; furthermore the ﬂuid becomes a Madelung ﬂuid if one choses
the equation in its usual linear version.

Although the validity of the model relies only on experiments and in particular on new
predictions which must be veriﬁed experimentally, we like to invoke here a theoretical argu-
ment that could justify the Schr¨odinger quantum-like approach we are going to apply. Let
us think of particles in motion within a bunch in such a way that the single particle moves
under an average force ﬁeld due to the presence of others and collides with the neighbouring
ones in a complicated manner. It is obviously impossible to follow and predict all the forces
deterministically. We then face a situation where the classical motion determined by the
force-ﬁeld is perturbed continuously by a random term, and we have a connection with a
stochastic process. If one simply assumes that the process is Markovian and Brownian, one
obtains following Nelson [3], a modiﬁcation of the classical equations of motion that can
be synthesized by a linear Schr¨odinger equation which depends on a physical parameter
having the dimension of action [4]. Usual wave quantum mechanics follows if this parame-
ter is chosen as the Planck’s constant ¯h, whereas the quantum-like theory of beams in the
linearized version is obtained if one choses the normalized emittance ǫ [1]. In both cases,
quantum particle and beam respectively, the evolution of the system is expressed in terms
of a continuous ﬁeld ψ deﬁning the so called Madelung ﬂuid. We may notice that the nor-
malized emittance ǫ having the dimension of action is the natural choice for the parameter
in the quantum-like theory that corresponds to Planck’s constant ¯h in the quantum theory,
because it reproduces the corresponding area in the phase-space of the particle.

We here point out that, after linearizing the Schr¨odinger-like equation, for beams in an
accelerator one can use the whole apparatus of quantum mechanics, with a new interpre-
tation of the basic parameters (for instance the Planck’s constant ¯h
ǫ where ǫ is the
−→
xi, ti) of the Feynman
normalized beam emittance) and introduce the propagator K (xf , tf |
theory for both longitudinal and transversal motion. A procedure of this sort seems partic-
ularly eﬀective for a global description of several phenomena such as intrabeam scattering,
space-charge, particle focusing, that cannot be treated easily in detail by “classical mechan-
ics” and are considered to be the main cause for the creation of the Halo around the beam
line with consequent losses of particles.

Let us indeed consider the Schr¨odinger like equation for the beam wave function

in the linearized case U (x, t) does not depend on the density
transversal beam emittance deﬁned as follows:

˜ǫ being the emittance usually considered, where as we may introduce the analog of the de
Broglie wavelength as λ = ǫ/p. We now focus our attention on the one dimensional transver-
sal motion along the x-axis of the beam particles belonging to a single bunch and assume a
Gaussian transversal proﬁle for a particles injected in to a circular machine. We describe all
the interactions mentioned above, that cannot be treated in detail, as diﬀraction eﬀects by
a phenomenological boundary deﬁned by a slit, in each segment of the particle trajectory.
This condition should be applied to both beam wave function and its corresponding beam
propagator K. The result of such a procedure is a multiple integral that determines the

actual propagator between the initial and ﬁnal states in terms of the space-time intervals
due to the intermediate segments.

From the approximate formulae 10 and 16 we notice that the parameter τ does not play
a signiﬁcant role in the calculation of the probabilities. We gave it a value τ = 1 sec.,
considering about 106 revolutions in LHC and HIDIF storage rings.

V. CONCLUSION

The parameters entering into the probability formulae are very few and must be looked
at as purely phenomenological. To be more speciﬁc, b, τ , and T (b in particular) hide
several fundamental processes that may be present in the beam bunches and that play a
deterministic role in the creation of the halo such as intrabeam scattering beamstrahlung,
space-charge eﬀects and imperfections in the magnets of the lattice that cause nonlinear
perturbative eﬀects.

The fact that such a small amount parameters take into account many physical processes
is a nice feature of the quantum-like diﬀraction approach. However a way of connecting this
method with the physical processes mentioned above as well as with the nonlinear dynamical
classical theory is mandatory at this point.

Another interesting feature of the parameters used is that their numerical values are very
reasonable because they are within the ranges. One expects: T may be considered as the
average time interval between the two successive injection, τ the time interval between two
successive diﬀractions (τ = nτ ′ is the total time of revolutions) and 2b the phenomenological
diﬀraction slit width. We recall that in the usual optics diﬀraction through a slit is also a
macroscopic means of dealing with many complicated physical eﬀects such as scattering of
light, electrons etc., at the atomic level.

The two relevant concluding remarks are the following:

1. The probability calculated from the free and the harmonic oscillator propagators (both
in the transversal motion of the particles) appear very close for the two diﬀerent circular
systems such as LHC and HIDIF rings.

2. The HIDIF scenario, as expected has a total loss of beam power which is at least 103

times higher than LHC.

These preliminary numerical results are encouraging because they predict halo losses
which seem under control. Indeed the HIDIF scenario gives a total loss of beam power per
meter which is about a thousand higher than the LHC; however in both cases the estimated
losses appear much smaller than the permissible 1 Watt/m.

The design of the proposed linear collider TESLA is based
on 9-cell 1.3 GHz superconducting niobium cavities, oper-
ated in pulsed mode [1]. Within the framework of an inter-
national collaboration the TESLA Test Facility (TTF) has
been set up at DESY, providing the infrastructure for cav-
ity R&D towards higher gradients [2]. More than 60 nine-
cell cavities were tested, accelerating gradients as high as
30 MV/m were measured.
In the second production of
TTF-cavities the average gradient was measured to be 24.7
MV/m. Two modules, each containing eight resonators, are
presently used in the TTF-linac. These cavities are oper-
ated in pulsed mode: 0.8 ms constant gradient with up to 10
Hz repetitions rate. We will focus on two aspects: Firstly,
the cavity fabrication and treatment is discussed, allowing
to reach high gradients. Latest results of single cell cavi-
ties will be shown, going beyond 40 MV/m. Secondly, the
pulsed mode operation of superconducting cavities is re-
viewed. This includes Lorentz force detuning, mechanical
vibrations (microphonics) and rf ﬁeld control. Both top-
ics meet the upcoming interest in superconducting proton
linacs, like the sc driver linac for SNS (Spallation Neutron
Source).

INTRODUCTION

The aim of the cavity program - launched by the TESLA
collaboration in 1992 - is to explore the technology of high
gradient superconducting cavities and to demonstrate the
performance and reliability of a superconducting linac op-
erated in pulsed mode. The infrastructure for the treatment,
assembly and test of superconducting cavities has been es-
tablished at DESY. A full integrated system test with beam
is done at the TTF-linac [2].
In a ﬁrst step the design
goal for the cavities of the TTF-linac was set to the value
Eacc =15 MV/m. The aim was to gradually approach
the accelerating gradient of 22 MV/m required for TESLA
with a centre-of-mass energy Ecm = 500 GeV [3].

2 PERFORMANCE OF THE

SUPERCONDUCTING TTF-CAVITIES

The TTF 9-cell cavities are fabricated from RRR = 300
niobium by electron-beam welding of half cells that are
deep-drawn from niobium sheet metal, see Fig. 1. The
cavities have been ordered at four European companies and
have been prepared and tested at DESY [4]. The presently
used standard cavity preparation before the vertical test

consists of the following steps:

• removal of the damage layer by buffered chemical
polishing (BCP): 80 µm from the inner and 30 µm
from the outer cavity surface

• 2 hours heat treatment at 800 ◦C
• 4 hours heat treatment at 1400 ◦C with titanium getter
• removal of the titanium layer by 80 µm inner

and 30 µm outer BCP

• ﬁeld ﬂatness tuning
• ﬁnal 20 µm removal from the inner surface by BCP
• high pressure rinsing (HPR) with ultrapure water
• drying by laminar ﬂow in a class 10 cleanroom
• assembly of all ﬂanges, leak-check
• 2 times HPR, drying by laminar ﬂow and assembly

of the input antenna with high external Q.

2.1 Vertical Test Results
Up to date more than 60 nine-cell cavities have been tested
with cw rf-excitation in the vertical cryostat. The time de-
velopment of the test results is summarized in Fig. 2. The
performance improvement over the past years is clearly vis-
ible. In particular, during the last year nearly all of the cav-
ities performed above 22 MV/m. More important, the ma-
jority of these cavities reached their good performance al-
ready in the ﬁrst test. The distribution of the maximum gra-
dient is shown in Fig. 3 for all 9-cell cavities. In the cavities
with low performance defects in the welds or in the bulk
niobium were found [4]. For the second cavity production
the welding technique was improved and all niobium sheets
were eddy current scanned. These cavities reached an aver-
age accelerating gradient of 24.7 MV/m, thereby exceeding

2.2 Horizontal Test Results
After the cavities have passed the vertical acceptance test
successfully, the helium vessel is welded to the head plates
of the cavity, see Fig. 1. A 20 µm removal from the inner
surface follows. In the last preparation step before the hori-
zontal test, the main power coupler is assembled to the high
pressure rinsed cavity. The external Q of the power coupler
is typically 2·106. More than 30 cavites have been tested in
pulsed mode operation (see Fig. 7) in the horizontal cryo-
stat (”CHECHIA”). The average gradient achieved in the
vertical and the horizontal tests are quite similar as shown
in Fig. 4. In a few cases the performance was reduced in
the horizontal test due to ﬁeld emission. In other cavities
the maximum gradient was improved by the fact that the
cavites are operated in pulsed mode instead of the cw op-
eration in the vertical test. These results demonstrate that
the good performance of a cavity can be preserved after the
accembly of the helium vessel and the power coupler.

2.3 Cavity Performance in the TTF-Modules
Eight 9-cell cavities, each with its own helium vessel and
main power coupler, are assebled in a string in the clean-
room. The cavity string is than installed in a cryo-module.
Up to date four accelerator modules have been built, three
of them have been tested in the TTF linac (the third one
replaced module #1). The cavities in the modules are op-
erated in pulsed mode: 0.8 ms constant gradient with up to
10 Hz repetitions rate (see Fig. 7). Due to the fact that all
cavities of a module are operated at the same gradient, the
performance of a module is limitted by the cavity with the
lowest performance. The measured average gradient was
16 MV/m, 20 MV/m and 22.5 MV/m for the modules #1,
2 and 3, respectively. The module #4 has been equipped
with cavities, that have shown a performance of Eacc ≥25
MV/m in the vertical test.

3 CAVITY R&D

The single-cell cavity R&D program focuses on possible
simpliﬁcations in the cavity production and treatment
and on pushing the cavity performance towards higher
gradients. For a possible energy upgrade of TESLA to
Ecm = 800 GeV the performance of the cavities has to be
pushed closer to the physical limit of 50-60 MV/m. This
limit is determined by the properties of the superconductor
niobium. However,
the
maximum gradient is limited at lower gradients by three
main effects:

in the present 9-cell cavities,

• thermal instabilities (quenches)
• ﬁeld emission currents
• decrease of the quality factor without indication of

ﬁeld emission at 25-30 MV/m.

The ﬁrst
limitation can be caused by defects in the
material or weld. Therefore the sensitivity of the eddy
current scanning apparatus was improved signiﬁcantly for

a better diagnostic of niobium sheets with tiny defects
[5]. In order to raise the onset of ﬁeld emission further,
efforts are undertaken to improve the high pressure rinsing
system and the particle control during the assembly in the
cleanroom [6]. The third limitation is not well understood
yet but measurements on electropolished superconducting
cavities have demonstrated, that electropolishing (EP) can
overcome this limit.

3.1 Electropolished Cavities
In a collaboration between KEK and Saclay it has been
shown convincingly that EP raises the maximum acceler-
ating ﬁeld in 1-cell cavities by more than 7 MV/m with
respect to the standard buffered chemical polishing [7].
Therefore in a joined effort between CERN, DESY, KEK
and Saclay a electropolishing system for 1-cell cavities
has been set up at CERN for further investigations. Us-
ing the KEK-style electropolishing, very high gradients
around 40 MV/m have been achieved in several 1-cell res-
onators, as shown in Fig. 5. Interestingly also this cavities

showed a decrease of the quality factor without indication
of ﬁeld emission at high gradients, before bakeout at mod-
erate temperature (∼100 ◦C). However, experiments have
shown that in-situ baking at moderate temperature drops
RBC S by a factor of 2, signiﬁcantly reduces the Q-slope
and improves the maximum gradients in EP cavities [8, 9].
Presently it is unclear, why this bakeout seems to be more
efﬁcient on EP cavities than on BCP cavities. It is remark-
able, that the high performance of electropolished 1-cell
cavities is achieved without high-temperature (1400 ◦C)
treatment, normally done to improve the niobium quality.

resonators in collaboration with KEK.

reach highest gradients. Presently two methods of cav-
ity fabrication without welding are studied: spinning [10]
and hydroforming [11]. The hydroforming of cavities from
seamless niobium tubes is being pursued at DESY. Four
1-cell cavites have been successfully built so far. Af-
ter a buffered chemical polishing, one of these resonators
reached a high accelerating gradient of 32.5 MV/m at a re-
markable high quality factor Q0 = 2 · 1010. By electropol-
ishing the inner surface of this cavity the gradient was fur-
ther enhanced beyond 40 MV/m, again showing a very high
quality factor, see Fig. 6. One should note that this cavity

was produced from a low RRR niobium (RRR = 100).
Afer a 1400 ◦C heat treatment the RRR raised to 300-400.

Superstructure

3.3
The concept of the superstructure has been proposed for the
TESLA main linac, aiming to reduce the spacing between
the cavites and to save in rf components [12]. In this con-
cept several multi-cell cavities are coupled by short beam
tubes. The whole chain can be fed by one FM coupler at-
tached at one end beam tube. The superstructure-layout
is extensively studied at DESY since 1999. Computations
have been performed for the rf properties of the cavity-
chain, the bunch-to-bunch energy spread and multibunch
dynamics. A copper model of a 4 x 7-cell superstructure
has been built in order to compare with the simulations and
for testing the ﬁeld-proﬁle tuning and the HOM damping
scheme [13]. A ”proof of principle” niobium prototype of
the 4 x 7-cell superstructure is now under construction and
will be tested with beam at the TESLA Test Facility in 2001
[14].

tivated by the potential of cost reduction, but recent tests
have shown, that seamless cavities are also promising to

the ﬂat-top of 800 µs when beam is accelerated, but it is
equally desirable to control the ﬁeld during ﬁlling to ensure
proper beam injection conditions. The pulsed structure
of the rf ﬁeld and the beam current puts demanding
requirements on the rf control system. There are two major
sources of ﬁeld perturbations in a superconducting cavity:

• beam loading and ﬂuctuation of the beam current
• modulation of the cavity resonance frequency.

The resonance frequency is modulated by deforma-
tions of the cavity walls induced by external mechanical
vibrations (microphonics) or by the time dependent
Lorentz force, see Fig. 7. The resulting amplitude and
phase perturbations are in the order of 5% and 20◦, re-
spectively. These errors must be suppressed by one to two
orders of magnitude by the rf control system. Fortunately,
the dominating perturbations (Lorentz force detuning and
beam loading) are highly repetitive from pulse to pulse.
Therefore they can be reduced by use of feedforward
compensation signiﬁcantly. The feedforward control is
optimized continously by making the feedforward system
adaptive [15]. The remaining non repetitive errors can be
suppressed by feedback control.

4.1 RF Field Control

The two modules installed in the TTF-linac are supplied
with rf power by one 10 MW multi-beam klystron. Ampli-
tude and phase control can be accomplished by modulation
of the incident rf wave which is common to the 16 cavi-
ties. Therefore control of an individual cavity ﬁeld is not
possible, but the sum of the electric ﬁeld vectors of all 16
cavities is regulated by a digital rf control system [16]. The
layout of the TTF digital rf control system is based on con-
trolling the real and imaginary part of the complex vector
sum, as shown in Fig. 8. The rf control system is realized
as a combination of feedback and feedforward control. The
effectiveness of the feedback system is limited by the loop
delay of 5 µs and the unity-gain bandwidth of about 20
kHz. When feedback is applied, the residual control er-
ror is dominated by a repetitive component. At the TTF

linac it could be demonstrated, that this error can be re-
duced further by more than an order of magnitude with the
adaptive feedforward [17]. The high degree of ﬁeld stabil-
ity achieved at the TTF linac is mainly due to the low level
of fast ﬂuctuations, like microphonics.

4.2 Microphonics

External mechanical vibrations can change the shape of the
cavity and thereby the eigenfrequency of the cavity. This
results in an amplitude and phase jitter of the accelerating
ﬁeld. Superconducting cavities are sensitive to microphon-
ics due to the thin wall thickness and the small bandwidth.
The rms microphonics frequency spread, measured in 16
cavities of the TTF-linac, is 9.5±5.3 Hz and thus surpris-
ingly small for a superconducting cavity system. The spec-
trum of this frequency ﬂuctuations is dominated be a few
frequencies.

4.3 Lorentz-Force Detuning

The resonance frequency of pulsed cavities is modulated
by the time-varying Lorentz force within the rf pulse, see
Fig. 7. The dynamic Lorentz force detuning is correlated
with the pulsed rf ﬁeld and is depending on the mechani-
cal properties of the cavity. The steady state Lorentz force
detuning at constant accelerating gradient Eacc is propor-
tional to the square of the gradient: ∆f = −K · E 2
acc.
The TTF cavities have been designed for a steady state
detuning constant K = 1 Hz/(MV/m)2. This quadratical
dependence is also reﬂected in the dynamic Lorentz force
detuning during the rf pulse. Figure 9 shows the fast in-
rease of the dynamic frequency shift at high ﬂat-top gra-
dients. Preliminary measurements at CHECHIA and the
TTF-linac indicate, that the dynamic detuning during the
ﬂat-top ranges form ±120 Hz (total drift 240 Hz) to ±300
Hz at the design gradient for TESLA500. The correspond-
ing additional rf power required to maintain a constant
accelerating ﬁeld during the ﬂat-top amounts to ∼5% to
∼30%. Given that the exta rf power for cavity ﬁeld control
should not exceed 10% this means that the stiffening of the
cavities for TESLA must be better controlled or increased.

4.4 Active Compensation of Lorentz-Force De-

tuning

In case that the present passive stiffening of the TTF cav-
ities does not limit the additional power to 10%, it will be
necessary to increase the stiffening (e.g. by copper spray-
ing [18]) or to implement a fast active frequency control
scheme. A solution for a fast frequency tuner could be
based on piezotranslators. The piezotranslator would allow
for a fast frequency tuning within the rf pulse to compen-
sate the detuning induced by the Lorentz force. A proof
of principle experiment of this compensation with a fast
piezotuner has been conducted successfully at the horizon-
tal test stand at DESY [19], see Fig. 10. Such a system
appears especially attractive since it will improve the over-
all efﬁciency of the TESLA linacs singniﬁcantly. More de-
taild studies will be done in the near future to determine the
performance limitations of a fast piezotuner.

5 CONCLUSIONS

The presented results demonstrate the availability of the
superconducting technology for the 500 GeV linear col-
lider TESLA. The TTF 9-cell cavities are now routinely
reaching the TESLA requirements of 22 MV/m. The third
module in the TTF-linac was successfully operated at the
TESLA design gradient. The technology needed for the
pulsed operation at high gradient was developed and the re-
liable operation of a superconducting linac in pulsed mode
was demonstrated at the TTF-linac. Recent results of 1-cell
cavities justify the optimism that the accelerating gradient
in the 9-cell cavities can be increased even further.

Orbit and Optics Improvement by Evaluating the Nonlinear BPM Response in CESR

Richard W. Helms and Georg H. Hoﬀstaetter
Laboratory for Elementary Particle Physics, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853

We present an improved system for orbit and betatron phase measurement utilizing nonlinear
models of BPM pickup response. We ﬁrst describe the calculation of the BPM pickup signals as
nonlinear functions of beam position using Green’s reciprocity theorem with a two-dimensional for-
malism. We then describe the incorporation of these calculations in our beam position measurements
by inverting the nonlinear functions, giving us beam position as a function of the pickup signals, and
how this is also used to improve our measurement of the betatron phase advance. Measurements
are presented comparing this system with the linearized pickup response used historically at CESR.

I.

INTRODUCTION

CESR measures beam position and betatron phase
with approximately one hundred beam position moni-
tors (BPMs) distributed around the storage ring. Each
BPM consists of four button-type electrodes mounted
ﬂush with, and electrically isolated from, the surface of
the beam pipe. A moving particle bunch induces charge
on the beam pipe walls and on the surface of each button,
which one can describe as image currents or as surface
charge due to the transverse component of the bunch’s
electric ﬁeld [1].

The BPM buttons are connected to electronics that
process and record signals which are a function of the dis-
tance between the button and the passing bunch. The
four signals from each BPM are used to determine the
beam position and betatron phase advance. At many
accelerators, the button signals’ nonlinear dependence
on the beam position is linearized for simplicity. Before
the improvements described here, this approach was also
used in CESR.

Our eﬀorts to improve the beam position measure-
ments by including the nonlinear BPM response is mo-
tivated by CESR’s pretzel orbits, where electron and
positron beams avoid parasitic collisions by following sep-
arate paths with large displacements from the central
axis of the beam pipe. The linearized methods are not
reliable for such large amplitudes, and have made accu-
rate beam position and betatron phase measurements at
CESR impossible under colliding beam conditions. We
will illustrate those shortcomings and present measure-
ments demonstrating improvement by using the nonlin-
ear models.

II. BACKGROUND

Many accelerators, including CESR, have traditionally
assumed a linear relationship between the beam posi-
tion and the BPM button signals. Given four signals
Si (i = 1, . . . , 4) from buttons arranged as in Fig. 1, the

where kx,y are scale factors set by the geometry of each
BPM type. This evaluation of BPM signals is often called
the diﬀerence-over-sum method. Equations (1-2) pro-
vide an estimation of the bunch position in relatively few
arithmetic operations.

Because analytical approaches to determining the fac-
tors kx,y make drastic approximations to the BPM geom-
etry, we have tried to measure the factors experimentally
at CESR through a variety of techniques summarized in
Table I. Those include translating a section of the beam
pipe containing the BPM with precision actuators, us-
ing a test stand with a movable antenna to simulate the
beam, and using the known value of the dispersion while
changing the beam energy in dispersive regions [2].

But precise knowledge of kx,y is of limited beneﬁt, since
Eqs. (1-2) yield only the linear part of the signal depen-
dence for bunches near the center of the BPM. In the next
section, we describe our technique for accurately calcu-
lating button signals, but let us ﬁrst use those results to
illustrate the limitation of the linearized formulae.

In Fig. 2, the four button signals were calculated nu-
merically for a beam at diﬀerent horizontal displace-
ments. The four signals were combined according to
Eq. (1) and plotted against the known horizontal dis-
placement. The slope near the origin gives k−1

large as 1.5 cm, this is precisely what has hindered accu-
rate measurements under colliding beam conditions until
the improvements described in this paper were imple-
mented.

FIG. 4: Linearized map distortion in CESR arc BPM with

The problem of this nonlinearity is made even more ev-
ident in two dimensions. Figures 3-4 show a regular grid
of (x, y) points and the mapping of those same points un-
der Eq. (1-2). Both BPMs show the characteristic pin-
cushion distortion, which increases with distance from
the origin.

In CESR, betatron phase measurements also rely on
a related assumption about the linearity of the button
signals. The betatron phase is measured by shaking the
beam at a sideband of the betatron frequency. For each
detector, the phase for each button is calculated by elec-
tronically comparing AC signal on that button to the
phase of the shaking. From the individual horizontal
(vertical) button phases θh,i(θv,i), the horizontal and ver-
tical betatron phase is calculated by

Aheiθh = eiθ2,h + eiθ4,h − eiθ1,h − eiθ3,h
Aveiθv = eiθ3,v + eiθ4,v − eiθ1,v − eiθ2,v ,

(3)
(4)

where Ah,v are real constants that are not used fur-
ther [3]. Other than the minus signs which account for
the assumption that the beam is shaking between the
pairs of buttons, this is simply an averaging of button
phases represented as complex vectors.

When the horizontal orbit amplitude is large, the beam
begins to shake underneath the buttons, and the rela-
tionship between the beam motion and the button signal
becomes complicated. In such cases, some of the buttons
may report an inaccurate phase, and averaging them with
the rest corrupts the ﬁnal answer. We will show how our
nonlinear models can improve not only beam position
measurements, but these measurements as well.

and an eﬃcient algorithm for inverting the model to yield
beam position.

A. Numerical Calculation of BPM Response

For accurate beam position measurements, a function
is required that expresses the bunch location (x, y) as a
nonlinear function of the button signals. Since the four
button signals lead to two coordinates (and a scale fac-
tor), the problem is over-constrained, and this function
cannot be obtained directly. The inverse (button signals
from beam position), however, is readily obtainable by
standard numerical techniques.

The most accurate and direct method of numerical so-
lution is to simulate the bunch in a three-dimensional
BPM, calculating the electromagnetic ﬁelds, and from
them, the charge on the buttons. The simulation could
be repeated for diﬀerent beam locations, and the ﬁelds
recalculated until enough solutions were accumulated to
describe the behavior over the entire BPM. However, this
is very computationally intensive, and can be avoided by
the methods that follow.

1. Two-Dimensional Approximation

suﬃciently long bunches and suﬃciently large values of
γ, the relevant values of k/γ can be neglected, i.e. when
γ2 ≪ ( σl

mensional, electrostatic case

∇2

⊥Φ(r) =

δ(r − r0).

ρk
φk
Since we only need Φ(r) up to a multiplicative factor, we
don’t worry about the constant coeﬃcients on the right-
hand side.

(9)

2. Green’s Reciprocity Theorem

Rather than perform a separate calculation of the but-
ton signals for many beam positions, we use Green’s reci-
procity theorem to calculate the button signals for all
(x, y) inside the BPM with a single numerical calcula-
tion. This theorem states that the surface charge σ on
a button due to a test charge at (x, y) is proportional to
the potential at that same position when the test charge
is absent and the button is excited by a potential V.

Suppose we have two scalar functions φ1 and φ2 in a
volume V bounded by a surface S. We form the vector
ﬁeld

A = φ1∇φ2

For ultra-relativistic bunches in a beam pipe with
constant cross section, the approximate electromagnetic
ﬁelds can be calculated using a two dimensional formal-
ism [4, 5]. Assuming the bunch has negligible transverse
extent, the charge distribution of the bunch may be writ-
ten, in the lab frame, as

where we have used ∇2φ = −ρ and ∂φ/∂n = σ (recall
that ˆn points into the conducting surface).

Connecting this result to the case of a BPM, imag-
ine φ1 corresponds to the potential when a single button
is excited with a potential V and all other surfaces are
grounded. We can calculate the potential φ1(x, y) by nu-
merical solution of Laplace’s equation. For the second
potential φ2, we ground all surfaces and put a charge
distribution ρ2(x, y) inside the BPM.

We plug the two cases into Eq. (16) and observe that
the third integral vanishes because there is no volume
charge for the ﬁrst case (ρ1 = 0 in V ). The fourth integral
vanishes because we grounded the beam pipe and the
buttons (φ2 = 0 on S). Since V can be pulled out of the
second integral, what remains is just the total charge on
the button, labeled qb, giving

φ1(x, y)ρ2(x, y) dV = −Vqb.

(17)

ZV

If ρ2 is a point charge q located at (x0, y0), then the
integral in Eq. (17) picks out the value φ1(x0, y0). We
arrive at the ﬁnal relation

qb = −

qφ(x0, y0)
V

,

(18)

remembering that φ(x, y) and V refer to the two diﬀerent
conﬁgurations.

Therefore, since the signal on a button is proportional
to the induced surface charge on that button qb, φ(x0, y0)
is the solution to the problem of calculating the button
signal, up to a multiplicative constant, as a function of
the bunch location.

3. Calculation of the Button Signals

Based on the previous arguments, we use POISSON
to solve the boundary value problem for φ(x, y). For the
two-dimensional boundary, we take a slice at the longitu-
dinal midplane of each BPM. The ﬁrst button is set (ar-
bitrarily) at 10 volts and all other surfaces are grounded.
POISSON generates a mesh inside the boundary, com-
putes the solution to Laplace’s equation on the mesh,
and stores the result at regular grid points in an output
ﬁle.

CESR BPMs have multiple geometric symmetries, so
the signals φi(x, y) on the other three buttons are just
reﬂections or rotations of the coordinates for the excited
button in the ﬁrst calculation of φ1(x, y). To compute
φi(x, y) between grid points, we use bicubic interpolat-
ing polynomials, which are stored for quick subsequent
evaluation.

4

(19)

result φi(x, y) from the POISSON calculation must be in-
verted, and since we have four constraints (four buttons)
and three parameters (position (x, y), and a scale factor)
we proceed by ﬁtting the calculated button signals to the
measured signals. We minimize the merit function

χ2 =

4

i=1
X

(qφi(x, y) − Si)2

i

,

where φi(x, y) is the signal on the ith button and the σi
are the uncertainties in the measured signals (which we
take to be the same for all four buttons). The factor q is
proportional to the beam current and could be used for
beam loss studies.

Minimization is performed via

the Levenberg-
Marquardt method provided in Numerical Recipes. This
requires an initial guess for the parameters, which we
ﬁnd by scanning only the grid points of φ(x, y) (without
evaluating the interpolating polynomials) for the values
of the parameters that minimize χ2. Then we iteratively
minimize over the continuous functions, typically arriv-
ing within less than 10−6 m of the minimum after six
steps.

C. Phase Measurements

We can improve our measurement of the betatron
phase advance between BPMs by incorporating our
knowledge of the nonlinear button response. In this mea-
surement, the beam is excited to small oscillations around
its equilibrium position (x0, y0). Let the phase and am-
plitude of the AC signal on the ith button be represented
by the complex number Ci, and let the phase and am-
plitude of the horizontal and vertical components of the
oscillatory beam motion be represented by complex num-
bers Ax and Ay, respectively. To ﬁrst order, their rela-
tionship is given by

Ci = ri,xAx + ri,yAy,

where the ri,(x,y) are given by

ri,x = q

The φi are the functions described in the previous sec-

eﬃcients of their interpolating polynomials.

Since the σi depend on the closed orbit deviation and the
values of Ax,y, the minimization must also be performed
iteratively. The horizontal and vertical phase advance is
then given by the complex phase of Ax and Ay. When-
ever a horizontal excitation creates a vertical amplitude,
or vice versa, this method is used in CESR to compute
the coupling coeﬃcients also.

IV. RESULTS

Testing the new system presents a challenge in that
we can only produce controlled large amplitude orbits
with the electrostatic separators. Since the separators are
calibrated from BPM measurements, they do not provide
an independent check on our ability to measure large
amplitudes accurately. Our strategy, therefore, must be
to use other measurements to check the accuracy at small
amplitudes, and then conﬁrm the expected linear relation
between the separator strength and the beam position at
large amplitudes.

FIG. 7: Beam position at two detectors calculated with the
nonlinear and linearized methods.

To observe the large amplitude accuracy of the new
system, we rely on the electrostatic separators to change
the orbit amplitude linearly. By increasing the horizon-
tal separator strength, we observe in Fig. 7 that the or-
bit calculated with the nonlinear method does show the
correct behavior, while the orbit calculated with the lin-
earized formula shows the deviation that was illustrated
in Fog. 2.

To demonstrate improvement in two dimensions, the
voltages on individual horizontal and vertical separators
were scanned over a regular grid. The measured beam
positions should also lie on a regular grid, which is shown
in Fig. 8. Some sheering is evident in the plot, which may
be due to coupling of the vertical and horizontal motion
between the separator and the BPM, or to a rotation of
the BPM. The pincushion eﬀect is notably reduced with
the new calculation.

We use betatron phase measurements to correct the
diﬀerence between the physical optics and the values in
our model lattice. Without the nonlinear correction,
large closed orbit distortions hindered this process since

Bunch length (cm)

FIG. 5: Beam position at various detectors showing little or

To perform a two-dimensional approximation, we ar-
gued that the bunches are suﬃciently long. To verify that
assumption, we have looked experimentally for a bunch
length dependence in large amplitude orbits. With the
pretzel at its nominal value of about 1.5 cm closed orbit
deviation, the bunch length was calculated from the mea-
sured synchrotron tune, which we adjust by changing the
RF accelerating voltage. As Fig. 5 illustrates, the beam
position shows little or no dependence over the range of
bunch lengths we expect in CESR.

Changing the RF frequency in CESR changes the beam
energy, and in dispersive regions, changes the beam po-
sition by up to a few millimeters. Measuring the beam
position at many diﬀerent energies allows us to measure
the dispersion, which we compare to the theoretical value
from the lattice in Fig. 6. This agreement veriﬁes the
small amplitude, or linear part of our nonlinear models.

ment we can achieve between the model phase and the
data when the new BPM calibration is used.

V. BPM CALIBRATION

The response of a particular BPM may diﬀer from that
of the computational model (linear or nonlinear) for a va-
riety of reasons. The leading candidate for this eﬀect is
the variation in insertion depth of the individual buttons
(i.e., the distance from the button surface to the surface
of its cylindrical housing). This manifests itself as diﬀer-
ent gains for the signals from diﬀerent buttons.

Following the method of [6, 7], we determine the gain
for each button from the capacitive coupling between
each pair of buttons. If the ideal coupling between two

With data drawn from approximately 3700 individual
beam position measurements, Fig. 10 shows that when
these coeﬃcients are employed, the χ2 of the ﬁt between
the measured signals and the modeled signals is signiﬁ-
cantly reduced. The resulting correction to the calculated
position is shown in Fig. 11 to be approximately 0.5 mm.

VI. CONCLUSION

Two-dimensional, electrostatic models of BPM pickup
response have been used with great success at CESR to
measure beam position and betatron phase advance for
large closed orbit distortions.

Calibration of our BPMs has reduced measurement er-

rors due to button misalignments.

Abstract

At present, the PEP-II bunch length and vertical beta function β∗
y at the Interaction Point (IP)
are about of the same size. To increase luminosity, it is planned to gradually reduce β∗
y . For
the maximum effect, bunch length has to be also reduced along with β∗
y to minimize luminos-
ity loss caused by the hourglass effect at IP. One of the methods to achieve a smaller bunch
length is to reduce momentum compaction factor. This paper discusses a lattice option for
the High Energy Ring, where the nominal 60◦ cells in four arcs are replaced by 90◦ cells to
reduce momentum compaction factor by 30% and bunch length by 16%. The increased fo-
cusing in 90◦ cells results in 40% stronger arc quadrupoles and 150% stronger arc sextupoles
due to reduced dispersion and larger chromaticity. Tracking simulations predict that dynamic
10 times the rms size of a fully coupled beam for a horizon-
aperture for this lattice will be

tal emittance of 30 nm and β∗
= 1 cm. The lattice modiﬁcation and results of simulations are

INTRODUCTION

One of the methods to increase luminosity at PEP-II [1]
y at the Interaction
y from the present
5 mm within

is to reduce a vertical beta function β∗
Point (IP). The current plan is to reduce β∗
value of 12.5 mm to 9 mm this year, and to
the next few years.

As a result, contribution to luminosity is gradually reduced
with distance from the beam waist at IP. This so-called
“hourglass” effect can be analytically estimated and trans-
lated into a luminosity reduction factor due to a ﬁnite bunch
length [2]. For ﬂat beams with equal beam size and emit-
tance, this factor depends only on one parameter β∗
y /σs and
is shown in Fig. 1.

At present, the bunch length and β∗

y at PEP-II are about
of the same size. According to Fig. 1, this corresponds to
14% of luminosity loss due to the hourglass effect. If β∗
y
is reduced from the current 12.5 mm to 9 mm and then
to 5 mm without changing σs, luminosity loss would in-
crease to 21% and 35%, respectively. One can conclude,
therefore, that for maximum PEP-II luminosity at lower β∗
y ,
bunch length has to be reduced as well.

Among other parameters, the equilibrium bunch length
depends on the total accelerating rf-voltage V , momentum

upgrade to increase rf-voltage for a smaller bunch length is
being implemented. However, the bunch length is a rela-
tively slow function of V , therefore many rf-cavities would
be needed for a large reduction of β∗
y . To help reduce the
bunch length, a reduction of momentum compaction factor
may be considered.

The momentum compaction factor is deﬁned by disper-

sion function ηx and bending radius ρ according to

where ηx depends on ρ and quadrupole focusing. A change
of bending properties or magnet locations is not consid-
ered in this paper since it would require a modiﬁcation
of machine geometry. Therefore, for a ﬁxed bending, a
smaller momentum compaction factor could be achieved
by reducing the average dispersion in bends by means of a
stronger quadrupole focusing. Such optics modiﬁcation is
discussed below for the PEP-II High Energy Ring (HER)
with β∗

y = 50/1 cm.

LATTICE MODIFICATION

Layout of the HER is shown in Fig. 2. The lattice con-
sists of six arcs with periodic 60◦ cells and six straight sec-
tions with various matched optics for the Interaction Re-
gion (IR), injection, rf-cavities, and tune and coupling cor-

increase the HER horizontal emittance to 48 nm, while in
the two arcs near IR it is caused by special β bumps for the
IR sextupoles. Because in the four arcs this perturbation
is a free betatron motion around the periodic ηx, it does
not change the average dispersion
and bunch length,

but increases
for a higher emittance. In the straight

sections, dispersion is canceled by dispersion suppressors.
The most contribution to momentum compaction factor
in HER comes from dispersion in the arcs. A simple way to
reduce
is to increase phase advance in the periodic arc
cells. The effect of phase advance per cell µc can be esti-
mated using a thin lens approximation. This method gives
the following well-known equations for the extreme (

Below, a modiﬁcation of HER optics for a lower mo-
mentum compaction factor is considered, where phase ad-
vance in the four arcs farthest from IR is increased from
60◦ to 90◦ per cell. The other two arcs contain some of
the IR sextupoles and skew quadrupoles to compensate the
detector solenoid and non-linear chromaticity. In order to
maintain the original IR optics and local correction, these
two arcs were not changed.

Since the maximum β functions are about the same in
60◦ and 90◦ cells, physical aperture acceptance will not be
reduced by this modiﬁcation. As in 60◦ optics, the 90◦
cells naturally provide
I transformation between arc sex-
tupoles to help compensate the third order sextupole aber-
rations. Also, the ﬁrst order chromatic perturbation of β
function is naturally suppressed in 90◦ lattice.

According to Eqn. 7, the average dispersion in 90◦ arc is
reduced by a factor of 2 compared to 60◦ lattice. Conse-
quently, the momentum compaction factor in four 90◦ and
two 60◦ arcs is reduced by a factor of 2
3 compared to the
60◦ value. From Eqn. 3–5, disadvantages of 90◦ cells are
a factor of √2 stronger quadrupoles, a factor of √3 larger
linear chromaticity per cell and a factor of 2√2 stronger
sextupoles (K2

K1/ηx).

To maintain the original non-dispersive optics in the in-
jection, tuning and rf-cavity sections, quadrupole focusing
in dispersion suppressors designed for 60◦ arcs was appro-
priately adjusted to match the straight sections to the new β
functions and reduced dispersion in 90◦ arcs. One compli-
cation was related to the original design of arc sextupoles,
where each of the four arcs has 12 SF and 12 SD sextupoles
to correct linear chromaticity. Ideally, the same family sex-
tupoles should have identical lattice functions to minimize
residual sextupole aberrations. But in the HER, 2 SF and
2 SD sextupoles in each arc are extended into the disper-
sion suppressors which have different optics compared to
In the original 60◦ design, lattice functions at
the arcs.
the above 4 sextupoles were made reasonably close to the
periodic values in the arcs. It has been found particularly
important to keep this property in the 90◦ modiﬁcation as
well. It was veriﬁed that a large change of β functions at
these sextupoles could reduce dynamic aperture to unac-
ceptable level. This is caused by an increase of the third
order sextupole geometric aberrations if they are not sufﬁ-
ciently compensated due to breakdown of optical periodic-
ity and

I transformation at the 4 sextupoles.

The resultant dispersion in HER with four 90◦ arcs is
shown in Fig. 4. In this option, a periodic dispersion with-
out modulation is used in the 90◦ arcs, while dispersion
in the two arcs near IR is not changed. Some of the HER
global parameters for the original 60◦ and modiﬁed 90◦ lat-
tice with β∗
y = 50/1 cm are shown in Table 1, where the

tune were simulated in LEGO prior to tracking. The re-
sultant dynamic aperture at the injection point is shown
in Fig. 6, where the 10 dash lines represent different er-
ror settings. The area inside a dash line corresponds to a
particle stable motion. This dynamic aperture exceeds 10σ
depicted by a solid line, where σ is the rms size of a fully
coupled beam at injection with ǫx = 30 nm and ǫy = ǫx/2.
This dynamic aperture should be sufﬁcient for beam oper-
ation. We conclude, therefore, that 90◦ optics in HER for a
lower momentum compaction factor may be considered as
an option for a shorter bunch length.

total voltage of V = 14 MV was used.

Momentum compaction factor is reduced by 30% in the
90◦ modiﬁcation, therefore the bunch length is expected to
decrease by 16%. The reduced dispersion in 90◦ arcs re-
sults in a smaller horizontal emittance ǫx in this option. A
modulation of ηx may be introduced to increase the emit-
tance. For the same rf-voltage, synchrotron tune νs is also
reduced by 16% since it scales as √α V . If the voltage is
increased for a smaller bunch length, νs could be restored.
Naturally, the stronger quadrupole focusing in 90◦ arcs
increases the HER betatron tune νx/νy and linear chro-
maticity ξx/ξy. Quadrupole strength increases by 42% in
the 90◦ arcs, and the SF, SD sextupoles become stronger by
a factor of 2.3 and 2.5, respectively, compared to 60◦ de-
sign. The large increase in strength may require an upgrade
for some of these magnets.

Optics and compensation schemes of the Interaction Re-
gion have not been changed in this modiﬁcation. The IR
sextupoles provide correction of the non-linear chromatic-
ity generated in the ﬁnal quadrupole doublets near IP. It has
been important to verify that compensation of non-linear
chromaticity has not been affected by arc modiﬁcations. In-
deed, calculation of betatron tune and β∗ in the 90◦ lattice
versus relative momentum deviation ∆p
p showed a negli-
gible change of non-linear chromaticity compared to the
original optics. This conﬁrms that the IR chromaticity cor-
rection is, indeed, local. Tune shift in the modiﬁed HER
p < 10σp,
is shown in Fig. 5 for the range of
where σp is the rms relative energy spread in the beam, and
linear chromaticity is set to zero.

CONCLUSION

It has been shown that momentum compaction factor in
HER can be reduced by 30% by increasing phase advance
per cell from 60◦ to 90◦ in four arcs. The resultant dynamic
aperture exceeds 10σ and is considered adequate. The ex-
pected reduction of bunch length in this option is 16%.

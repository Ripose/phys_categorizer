INTRODUCTION

In the method of ordinary three-dimensional radiative
cooling of ion beams a laser beam overlaps an ion beam,
its transverse position is motionless, all ions interact with
the laser beam independent of their energy and ampli-
tude of betatron oscillations. The diﬀerence in rates of
momentum loss of ions having maximum and minimum
energies in the beam is small. That is why the cooling
time of the ion beam is high [1] - [3].

When a cooling is produced in a dispersion-free
straight section and the laser beam intensity is constant
inside the area of the laser beam occupied by a being
cooled ion beam, then the damping times of the horizon-
tal vertical and phase oscillations are:

τx = τy =

τǫ
1 + D

=

2ε
P

,

(1)

where P is the average power of scattered radiation; ε,
ion energy; D, saturation parameter.

The physics of radiative ion cooling is similar to syn-
chrotron radiation damping. Friction causes the appear-
ance of a reaction force on the emitting particle. Liou-
ville’s theorem does not valid for such non-conservative
system. At the same time in the case of non-selective in-
teraction the Robinson’s damping criterion is valid: the
sum of damping decrements τ −1
In a
particular choice of lattice and laser or material target,
damping rates can be shifted between diﬀerent degrees
of freedom. However the decrements are limited by the
criterion by the value τx,y,s
2(1 + D)ε/(3 + D)P when
all decrements are greater then or equal to zero [4, 5].

x,y,s is a constant.

II. ENHANCED LASER COOLING

The method of enhanced resonance laser cooling of
ion beams in the longitudinal plane is based on the
Rayleigh scattering of ”monochromatic” laser photons
by not fully stripped ion beams or by complicated nu-
clei when the radio-frequency (RF) system of the storage
ring is switched oﬀ [6] - [10]. In this method the laser
beam overlaps the ion beam and has a chirp of frequency.
Ions interact with the laser beam at resonance energy, de-
crease their energy in the process of the laser frequency
scanning until all of them reach the minimum energy of
ions in the beam. At this frequency the laser beam is
switched oﬀ. The higher energy of ions the earlier they

begin interaction with the laser beam, the longer the time
of interaction. Ions of minimum energy do not interact
with the laser beam at all. In such a way, in this method,
the selective interaction is realized. The damping time
of the ion beam in the longitudinal plane is determined
by the dispersion σε of its energy spread

τǫ =

2σε
P

.

(2)

The damping time (2) is ε/σε

103 times less than
(1). At the same time the transverse decrements are zero.
From this it follows that the selectivity of interaction
leads to the violation of the Robinson’s damping criterion
and open the possibility of the enhanced cooling.

∼

Below we will consider the non-resonance methods of
enhanced cooling of ion beams in the longitudinal and
transverse planes. These methods can be used for cooling
of another particles as well. A universal kind of selective
interaction of particles with moving in the radial direc-
tion laser or media targets will be used. By analogy with
the resonance laser cooling the interaction region in this
case change its radial position in the being cooled beam
for the cooling process when the dispersion function of
the storage ring is not equal to zero at the interaction
region. Robinson’s damping criterion does not work in
this case as well (see Appendix).

A. New enhanced cooling methods

For the sake of simplicity we will neglect the emission of
the synchrotron radiation by ions in the bending magnets
of a storage ring, supposing that the RF system of the
ring is switched oﬀ and the broadband laser beams (or
material targets) are homogeneous and have sharp edges
in the radial directions. We suppose that the jump of
instantaneous orbits of ions caused by the energy loss is
less than the amplitude of their betatron oscillations.

In a smooth approximation, the motion of an ion rel-
ative to its instantaneous orbit is described by the equa-
tion xβ = A cos(Ωt + ϕ), where xβ = x
xη is the ion
deviation from the instantaneous orbit xη; x, its radial
coordinate; A and Ω, the amplitude and the frequency
of betatron oscillations. If the coordinate xβ 0 and trans-
verse radial velocity of the ion ˙xβ 0 =
AΩ sin(Ωt0 +ϕ)
correspond to the moment t0 of change of the ion en-
ergy in a laser beam then the amplitude of betatron
oscillations of the ion before an interaction is A0 =

the ion instantaneous orbit will be changed by a value

tion the value δA =
that to produce the enhanced cooling of an ion beam
in the transverse plane we must create such conditions
when ions interact with a laser beam under deviations
from the instantaneous orbit xβ0 of one sign. In this case
the value δA has one sign and the rate of change of am-
plitudes of betatron oscillations of ions is maximum. A
selective interaction of ions with the laser beam is neces-
sary to realize this case.

FIG. 1: The scheme of the enhanced electron cooling.
The axis ”y” is the equilibrium orbit of the storage ring; T1
and T2 the laser beams. The transverse positions of laser
beams are displaced with the velocity ~vT1,2 relative to the
equilibrium orbit, 1-1, 2-2, ... the location of the instanta-
neous electron orbit, and 1,2,3, ... the electron trajectories
after 1,2,3, ... events of the energy loss.

Two schemes of a selective interaction of ion and laser
beams for cooling of ion beams in the transverse and lon-
gitudinal planes can be suggested (see Fig.1 ). For the
transverse cooling, the laser beam T1 is used. At the
initial moment it overlaps a small external part of the
ion beam in the radial direction in the straight section of
the storage ring with non zero dispersion function. First

2

ions with largest initial amplitudes of betatron oscilla-
tions interact with the laser beam. Immediately after the
interaction and loss of the energy the position and direc-
tion of momentum of an ion remain the same, but the
instantaneous orbit is displaced inward in the direction
of the laser beam. The radial coordinate of the instan-
taneous orbit and the amplitude of betatron oscillations
are decreased to the same value owing to the dispersion
coupling. After every interaction the position of the in-
stantaneous orbit approaches the laser beam more and
more, and the amplitude of betatron oscillations is com-
ing smaller.
It will reach some small value when the
instantaneous orbit reaches the edge of the laser beam.
When the depth of dipping of the instantaneous orbit of
the ion in the laser beam becomes greater than the am-
plitude of its betatron oscillations, the orbit will continue
its motion in the laser beam with constant velocity. The
amplitude of betatron oscillations will not be changed.

The degree of overlapping is changed by moving uni-
formly the laser beam position from inside in the direc-
1.
tion of the being cooled ion beam with some velocity vT1
When the laser beam reaches the instantaneous orbit cor-
responding to ions of maximum energies then the laser
beam must be switched oﬀ and returned to a previous
position. All ions of the beam will have small amplitudes
of betatron oscillations and increased energy spread. Ions
with high amplitudes of betatron oscillations will start to
interact with a laser beam ﬁrst, their duration of inter-
action and absolute decrease of amplitudes of betatron
oscillations will be higher.

To realize the enhanced cooling of an ion beam in the
longitudinal plane we can use a broadband laser beam T2
located in the region of a storage ring with non zero dis-
persion function. The radial laser beam position is mov-
ing uniformly from outside in the direction of the being
cooled ion beam with a velocity vT2 higher than maxi-
mum velocity ˙xη in of the ion instantaneous orbit deep-
ened in the laser beam. At the initial moment, the laser
beam overlaps only a small part of the ion beam. The
degree of overlapping is changed in such a way that ions
of maximum energy, ﬁrst and then ions of lesser energy,
come into interaction. When the laser beam reaches the
orbit of ions of minimum energy then it must be switched
oﬀ and returned to the previous position. In this case,
the rate of the energy loss of ions in the beam will not
be increased, but the diﬀerence in duration of interaction
and hence in the energy losses of ions having maximum
and minimum energies will be increased essentially. As
a result all ions will be gathered at the minimum energy
in a short time.

1 Instantaneous orbits can be moved in the direction of the laser
beam, instead of moving of a laser beam. A kick, decreasing of
the value of the magnetic ﬁeld in bending magnets of the storage
ring, a phase displacement or eddy electric ﬁelds can be used for
this purpose.

Interaction of ion beams with transversely

moving laser beams

In the methods of enhanced laser cooling of ion beams
the internal and external laser beam positions are dis-
placed in the transverse directions. Below the evolution
of amplitudes of betatron oscillations and positions of
instantaneous orbits in the process of the energy loss of
ions in laser beams will be analyzed.

·

The velocity of an ion instantaneous orbit ˙xη depends
xη between the edge of the laser
on the distance xT1,2 −
beam and the instantaneous orbit, and on the amplitude
of betatron oscillations. When the orbit enters the laser
beam at the depth higher than the amplitude of betatron
oscillations then ions interact with the laser beam ev-
ery turn and theirs velocity reaches the maximum value

the general case, the velocity ˙xη can be presented in the
form ˙xη = W

ion crossing the laser beam. W is the ratio to a period
of a part of the period of betatron oscillations of the

ion determined by the condition
when the deviation of the ion from the instantaneous or-
bit is directed to the laser beam and is greater than the
distance between the orbit and the laser beam. Proba-

The behavior of the amplitudes of betatron oscillations

∂A/∂xη =

ation from the instantaneous orbit averaged through the

Let the initial instantaneous ion orbits be distributed
in a region
σx,ε,0 relative to the location of the mid-

ion radial betatron oscillations A0 be distributed in a re-
gion σx,b,0 relative to their instantaneous orbits, where
σx,ε,0 and σx,b,0 are dispersions. The dispersion σx,ε,0 is
determined by the initial energy spread σε,0.

Suppose that the initial spread of amplitudes of beta-
tron oscillations of ions σx,b,0 is identical for all instan-
taneous orbits of the beam. The velocities of the instan-
taneous orbits in a laser beam ˙xη in < 0, the transverse

velocities of the laser beams vT1 > 0, vT2 < 0. Below
we will use the relative radial velocities of the laser beam
displacement k1,2 = vT1,2 / ˙xη in, where vT1,2 = dxT1,2 /dt.
In our case k1 < 0, k2 > 0.

ξ1,2A(ξ1,2). The time derivative is ∂xη/∂t =

tudes of betatron oscillations of these ions. First of all
the laser beam T2 interacts with ions having the largest

From this it follows that cooling of ion beams both in
the transverse and longitudinal planes, in turn, does not
lead to their total cooling in these planes. We can cool
ion beams either in the transverse or longitudinal planes.

To cool an ion beam both in the transverse and longitu-
dinal planes we must look for combinations of enhanced
nonresonance methods of cooling with other methods.

In the nonresonance method of enhanced longitudi-
nal laser cooling, contrary to the transverse one, the
degree of longitudinal cooling is much greater than the
degree of heating in the transverse plane. That is why
we can use the emittance exchange between longitudinal
and transverse planes when the RF system is switched
on and a synchro-betatron resonance [13] - [16] or dis-
persion coupling by additional motionless wedge-shaped
targets [11, 12, 17] are used together with the moving
there and back target T2. In such a way the enhanced
two-dimensional cooling of the ion beam based on the
longitudinal laser cooling can be realized2. In this case
the energy losses of ions in the laser beam per turn must
be higher than the maximum energy gain in the RF sys-
tem and the motion of the target T2 must be limited by
the region xT2 > 0. Cooling of particle beams in the RF
buckets is another problem to be considered elsewhere.

The enhanced nonresonance transverse method of laser
cooling together with the enhanced resonance longitudi-
nal one can be used for cooling of ion beams when the
RF system is switched oﬀ. A heating of the ion beam
in the longitudinal plane in the process of the enhanced
transverse cooling will be compensated completely by its
following cooling in the longitudinal plane.

IV. APPENDIX

We start by reviewing very brieﬂy the derivation of

Robinson’s damping criterion [13].

The general method of describing the motion of a parti-
cle in a circular accelerator is to determine an equilibrium
orbit, and then analyze small deviations from this orbit
as a linear combinations of normal modes of oscillation.
The characteristics of the modes are determined by solv-
ing for the principal values of the matrix. If the particle
motion is stable such that the particle oscillate about
the equilibrium position, and since the transfer matrix is
real, the principal values will be three pairs of complex
conjugate numbers, which determine the frequencies and
damping rates of the oscillation modes.

To ﬁnd damping rates K.W.Robinson considered an
element of the accelerator of inﬁnitesimal length and cal-
culated the six order transfer matrix for this element.
This matrix has inﬁnitesimal nondiagonal terms which
are ﬁrst order in the length of the element, and the di-
agonal terms diﬀer from unity by a quantity which is

2 For the wedge-shaped target the fast cooling eﬀect in one di-
rection is equal to near the same heating eﬀect in the other
one. That is why the combination of the fast emittance ex-
change with the enhanced longitudinal cooling can lead to the
two-dimensional enhanced cooling eﬀect. Cooling of muon beams
by material targets can be done similar way.

Pγ = Pγ, s(1 + 2∆B/B + 2∆ε/ε),

(21)

As a starting point for his proof K.W.Robinson took

proportional to the inﬁnitesimal length of the element.
In order to determine damping, the determinant of the
transfer matrix of the inﬁnitesimal element was evalu-
ated. The only terms in the determinant which are ﬁrst
order in the length of the element are due to the diagonal
terms of the matrix. The determinant of the transfer ma-
trix is given by 1 + Σδmn. The diagonal terms for x, y, z
and
are zero as changes in x, y are only related to x
repre-
, y, y
changes in z related to x. In this case x, x
sent the variation of displacement and angular deviation
in the radial and vertical planes, ∆ε and z represent the
variation in energy and azimuthal position from the val-
ues of an equilibrium particle, as measured at the time
the particle transverses the inﬁnitesimal element.

When the vertical and radial oscillations are not cou-
pled then damping decrements for vertical betatron and
synchrotron oscillations can be derived lightly and the
decrement for the radial betatron oscillations cam be de-
rived from the Robinson’s damping criterion. The decre-
ment for the radial betatron oscillations cam be derived
directly as well.

Below we would like to pay attention on the limits of

applicability of this criterion.

some assumptions. He wrote:

1. ”For small deviations from the principal orbit, a
transfer matrix for a complete period may be written
relating initial to ﬁnal deviations. This is usually done for
radial and vertical displacements and velocities, and may
be extended to sixth order transfer matrix relating initial
and ﬁnal vertical displacements and velocities, and also
energy variation, and longitudinal displacement, from the
values of a particle on the principal orbit. For this general
transfer matrix, the complete periods of the accelerator
are deﬁned so as to be identical in both magnet structure
and RF accelerating system.”

2. ”The diagonal term for ∆ε may be determined from
the characteristics of the radiation loss for small varia-
tions in E and B from the values for an ideal particle. B
is only a function of position, ... .” (see eq. (21).

3. ”If all modes are oscillatory the principal values will
be of the form exp γi, with six values of γi being three
pairs of complex conjugates.”

4. ”... This is a general result for any type of electron
accelerator if the average electron energy is constant.”
(He has in view (24) for the result).

We can see that the Robinson’s damping criterion was
received for the stationary conditions when the guiding
magnetic ﬁeld and the amplitude of the RF voltage does
not depend on time, particle energy loss is a linear func-
tion of both the energy deviation of the particle ∆ε and
the magnetic ﬁeld deviation ∆B in the region occupied
by the beam, all modes are oscillatory.

Linear dependence on ∆ε, ∆B and stationary condi-
tions are important for the exponential decay and the
concept of decrement. The equations of motion in our
case are the linear homogeneous Hill’s equations for the
transverse degrees of freedom and the pendulum equa-
tion for the longitudinal one when we neglect coupling
and losses. The losses lead to additional terms at the
ﬁrst order derivatives in the corresponding equations.

The violation of the Robinson’s assumptions can lead
to the violation of his damping criterion. Simple exam-
ples can justify this statement.

Example 1. Laser cooling of ion beams in the lon-
gitudinal plane. The RF system of the storage ring is
switched oﬀ. The homogeneous laser beam overlaps the
ion beam. The chirp of the laser frequency is used.

In this example there is no oscillatory motion of ions in
the longitudinal plane. The instantaneous orbits of ions
which are at resonance with the laser beam are moving
with a constant velocity to the motionless non-resonance
orbit of ions having minimal energy. When the orbit of
resonance ions reach the orbit of ions having minimal
energy the laser beam is switched oﬀ. We have non-
exponential low of bringing closer of resonance and non-
resonance ions. The damping time is determined by a
value (2), which is out of the Robinson’s damping cri-
terion. The degree of cooling for this time can be very
high and is determined by the natural line width of the
laser beam and the maximal energy of scattered photons.
Heating of the ion beam in the transverse plane will not
appear when the homogeneous laser beam is used.

This is the simplest example of the violation of the
Robinson’s damping criteria. Experiments conﬁrm this
conclusion [6] - [10].

We can use the broadband laser beam without chirp
and with sharp frequency edges.
Ions in this case will
be gathered at the orbit corresponding to the greatest
frequency of the laser beam.

The violation of the Robinson’s damping criterion in
this example is the consequence of the non-linear depen-
dence of the power of the emitted radiation on the de-
viation of the energy of interacting and non-interacting
ions of the minimal energy and less does not
ions ∆ε:
interact with the laser beam and keep their position. At
the same time ions interacting with the laser beam have

8

equal velocities. The rate of bringing closer of the energy
of interacting and non-interacting ions is maximum. At
the same time the heating in the transverce direction is
absent.

Example 2. Laser cooling of ion beams in the lon-
gitudinal plane. The RF system of the storage ring is
switched on. The homogeneous laser beam overlap the
ion beam. The broadband laser beam without chirp and
with sharp frequency edges is used. The lowest frequency
of the laser beam corresponds to the equilibrium energy
of ions. The power of radiation scattered by ions of the
energy greater then equilibrium one P
ε>εs > 0 and in
|
the opposite case P

ε≤εs = 0.
|

In this example the power P (ε) is not linear function
of the ion energy.
If the power of scattered radiation
is much higher than the maximum power which the ion
can extract from the RF system then all ions of the en-
ergy higher then equilibrium one will be gathered at the
equilibrium energy for a short time (much less then the
period of phase oscillation). Then we can switch oﬀ the
laser beam, wait a quarter of the period of phase oscil-
lation, switch on laser beam again and wait for damping
of the next part of the beam which appeared in the re-
gion of the energy ε > εs. Such beam manipulations we
can repeat three times. The beam will be cooled in the
bucket in the longitudinal plane. Heating of the ion beam
in the transverse plane will not appear in this case.

In this paper we have considered another, more compli-
cated schemes of cooling of particle beams based on non-
linear interaction of moving target with the being cooled
beam.

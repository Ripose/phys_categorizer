Abstract

The SPEAR 3 light source [1] has two 7.6 m straight sections one of which is available for
new insertion devices (ID). By reducing the vertical βy function at the center of the straight
from 9.8 m to 1.5 m, the beam size can be decreased from 44 µm to 17 µm to reduce the
ID gap, but the ID length may be limited by the increased βy variation in the ID. Alterna-
tively, a “double waist” optics with two symmetric low βy locations and a chicane may be
considered to implement two IDs. In this paper, we discuss the low βy optics, effects on the
beam dynamic aperture, and the ID parameters needed to maximize photon ﬂux density and
brightness while maintaining electron beam lifetime.

Abstract

The SPEAR 3 light source [1] has two 7.6 m straight
sections one of which is available for new insertion devices
(ID). By reducing the vertical βy function at the center of
the straight from 9.8 m to 1.5 m, the beam size can be de-
creased from 44 µm to 17 µm to reduce the ID gap, but
the ID length may be limited by the increased βy variation
in the ID. Alternatively, a “double waist” optics with two
symmetric low βy locations and a chicane may be consid-
ered to implement two IDs. In this paper, we discuss the
low βy optics, effects on the beam dynamic aperture, and
the ID parameters needed to maximize photon ﬂux density
and brightness while maintaining electron beam lifetime.

INTRODUCTION

The SPEAR 3 design optics consists of two periodic arcs
separated by the East and West matching cells [2]. Intended
locations for the insertion devices in the arcs are the twelve
3.1 m drift sections between the 14 arc cells and four 4.8 m
drifts at the arc ends. At present, the matching cells (MC)
have identical symmetric optics with a 7.6 m drift at the
center of MC and phase advance µx/µy = 1.6/0.8 [2π] per
cell. The East 7.6 m drift is available for the new IDs, and
the West MC will contain the RF accelerating cavities.

The photon ﬂux density and brightness in the insertion
devices depend on the electron beam size and, hence, β
functions at the IDs. At present, the βx/βy values are
10.2/4.7 m at the arc drift sections, and 5.0/9.8 m at the
center of 7.6 m drifts. For the SPEAR 3 design vertical
emittance of 0.2 nm at 3 GeV, the vertical beam size is 31
and 44 µm at the ID locations in the arcs and MCs, re-
spectively. The beam size and the ID gap can be reduced
by decreasing the βy at ID, but this will increase the beam
divergence and variation of βy in the ID. For a better ID
performance, a large βy variation in the insertion device
should be avoided by limiting the ID length or the mini-
mum value of βy. The βy value is also limited by the ac-
ceptable size of dynamic aperture and beam lifetime.

In this report, we discuss the low βy options for the
7.6 m drift in the East MC. The West MC was maintained
close to nominal in most of this study. The optics and dy-
namic aperture calculations were done using MAD [3] and
LEGO [4] codes, respectively.

The present SPEAR 3 optics has been well optimized
for a maximum dynamic aperture. To maintain the current
lattice properties, the following requirements were used for
the low beta modiﬁcations:

• Matched optics using local quadrupoles.

• Minimal change of the local phase advance.
• Minimal increase of maximum β functions.
• Realistic quadrupole strengths.
In addition, we tried to keep equal or close phase ad-
vance in the East and West MCs and limit the sextupole
strengths, since the stronger sextupoles and ring optical
asymmetry may enhance resonance effects and reduce dy-
namic aperture.

The nominal lattice functions in the MC are shown in
Fig. 1, where the 7.6 m drift is at center. The correspond-
ing dynamic aperture without ID effects is shown in Fig. 2,
where the solid and dash lines are for the nominal and 3%
off-energy particles, respectively. The dynamic aperture
simulations included a full set of magnet errors and ma-
chine correction for six random error settings.

2 SINGLE LOW βY IN THE MC

Several options for a matching cell with single low βy
were analyzed as listed in Table 1, where βx,y is at the
MC center, µx,y is the MC phase advance, ξx,y the ring
natural chromaticity, and KSF,SD the K-values of global
sextupoles.

The low βy optics in the East MC was matched using ﬁve
local quadrupole families while the West MC was main-
tained close to the nominal. For low β peaks and chro-
maticity, the MC phase advance was slightly varied. The
arc phase was adjusted accordingly to keep the working
tune at νx/νy = 14.19/5.23.

Comparison of the three βy = 1 m options showed a
larger dynamic aperture in case 3.
It indicates that the
preferred optical conditions are close to the nominal phase
advance, equal phase advance in the two MCs, low chro-
maticity and weak sextupoles. Note that low βy naturally
increases the MC vertical phase advance since µ = R ds
β .

Cases 4,5 with βy = 1.5 and 2 m were designed similar
to case 3. In comparison, the lower βy requires stronger fo-
cusing and larger quadrupole strengths as listed in Table 2.
Consequently, the lower βy leads to larger β peaks in the
MC, higher chromaticity and stronger sextupoles, and re-
duced dynamic aperture. At present, the QDXE, QFXE
design strengths are limited at |K| ≈ 2, therefore optics
with βy < 1 m would require an upgrade of these magnets.
Maintaining sufﬁcient aperture for horizontal injection
and beam lifetime with Touschek effects requires a large
horizontal dynamic aperture with up to 3% energy errors.
LEGO simulations with machine errors, but without ID ef-
fects, estimate the horizontal dynamic aperture near 16 mm
for βy = 1 m, and 17 mm for βy = 1.5 and 2 m, compared to
the nominal 18-20 mm aperture. This aperture may be suf-
ﬁcient even with the ID effects included which will reduce
it by ∼1-2 mm. For a conservative design, we consider
an option with βy = 1.5 m. The MC optics and dynamic
aperture in this case are shown in Fig. 3 and 4.

It had been shown that the SPEAR 3 horizontal emit-

tance can be reduced by allowing a small dispersion ηx ∼
10 cm in the arc drifts [5]. The required dispersion was ob-
tained by slightly mismatching the arc achromats and ap-
propriate adjustment of the matching cells. In this low βy
study, we veriﬁed dynamic aperture for ηx = 5 and 10 cm
in the arc drifts. LEGO simulations without ID effects
showed that at βy = 1.5 m the horizontal dynamic aperture
is 15-16 mm at ηx = 5 cm, and ∼13 mm at 10 cm disper-
sion. We conclude that dispersion up to 5 cm may be used
to reduce the horizontal emittance from 18.5 to 14.6 nm.

The low βy function increases beam divergence and βy
variation in the ID and may limit the ID length. At distance
s from the waist: βy(s) = βy + s2
, where βy is at the waist.
βy
For example, for βy(s) variation below 100% and the waist
at ID center, the half ID length has to be less than βy.

3 DOUBLE LOW βY IN THE MC

The 7.6 m straight section in the matching cell can be
upgraded to have two low βy locations for two IDs. A dou-
ble waist optics can be obtained using an extra quadrupole
triplet at center of the straight. An example of such optics
with two symmetric βy = 2 m locations is shown in Fig. 5,
where the space available for each ID is about 2 m and the
six local quadrupole families are adjusted to keep the MC
matched.

The separation of the two ID beam lines can be done us-
ing a four bend horizontal chicane. We investigated sym-
metric and anti-symmetric chicane schemes with 25 cm

dipoles placed symmetrically around the βy waists as
shown in Fig. 5. In the symmetric scheme, the bending an-
gles in the four dipoles were [-10,+10,+10,-10] mrad which
produce 24.7 mm closed orbit bump and 20 mrad angle be-
tween the beam lines. In the anti-symmetric scheme, the
bending angles were [-8,+25.7,-25.7,+8] mrad to generate
two ±19.8 mm bumps and parallel ID beam lines with hor-
izontal separation of 57 mm.

The chicane bends generate additional dispersion in the
MC. We found that with the symmetric chicane this dis-
persion can be locally compensated by slightly mismatch-

the dispersion could not be fully compensated using local
quadrupoles, but the residual dispersion in the ring is below
4 cm which is not a problem for the IDs. This dispersion
has only minor reduction effect on the emittance. The anti-
symmetric double waist optics is shown in Fig. 5.

The double βy optics further increases the vertical phase
advance in the MC. Similar to the single βy optics, the µy
has to be kept close to the nominal value for a better dy-
namic aperture. For realistic magnet strengths and matched
optics, the vertical phase advance was set at 1.1 [2π] as
compared to the nominal 0.8 [2π]. The MC sextupole
strengths were optimized for larger dynamic aperture.

LEGO simulations showed a larger dynamic aperture in
the anti-symmetric scheme as shown in Fig. 6. This aper-
ture may be sufﬁcient for the beam operation, but more
study is required for the design of ID beam lines.

4 UNDULATOR PERFORMANCE

The primary motivation for reducing βy in the matching
cells is to enhance hard x-ray brightness from small gap
undulators. To evaluate the potential performance of small
gap undulators in the MC, a rough examination of suitable
undulator parameters was undertaken using the XTC rou-
tine of the XOP software suite [6]. Tuning curve simu-
lations for hybrid, planar undulators in the absence of ﬁeld
errors are shown in Fig. 7 for the ID parameters listed in Ta-
ble 3. The curves depict the fundamental and odd harmon-
ics through the 9th order. For the high brightness hard x-ray
beams, the undulator parameters were selected to provide

reasonable tuning curve overlap in the E > 6 keV regime
without concern for the coverage gap between the ﬁrst and
third harmonics for E < 6 keV. The magnet gaps used in
the simulations preserve reasonable beam lifetime, though
somewhat improved performance at high energies could be
obtained using smaller gaps.

5 CONCLUSION

We conclude that the SPEAR 3 design permits single or
double low βy optics in the matching cell 7.6 m drift with
βy as low as 1 m. Dynamic aperture for this optics seems
to be acceptable for beam operation.

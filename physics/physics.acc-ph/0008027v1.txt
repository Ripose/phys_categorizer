Abstract. The physics of energy transfer between the laser and the plasma in laser
wakeﬁeld accelerators is studied. We ﬁnd that wake excitation by arbitrary laser shapes
can be parameterized using the total pulse energy and pulse depletion length. A tech-
nique for determining laser proﬁles that produce the required plasma excitation is
developed. We show that by properly shaping the longitudinal proﬁle of the driving
laser pulse, it is possible to maximize both the transformer ratio and the wake ampli-
tude, achieving optimal laser-plasma coupling. The corresponding family of laser pulse
shapes is derived in the nonlinear regime of laser-plasma interaction. Such shapes
provide theoretical upper limit on the magnitude of the wakeﬁeld and eﬃciency of
the accelerating stage by allowing for uniform photon deceleration inside the laser
pulse. We also construct realistic optimal pulse shapes that can be produced in ﬁnite-
bandwidth laser systems and propose a two-pulse wake ampliﬁcation scheme using the
optimal solution.

INTRODUCTION

Recent advances in laser technology allow one to create laser pulses with virtually
arbitrary temporal intensity proﬁles using amplitude and phase shapers [1–3]. Such
laser pulses with non-Gaussian axial intensity are now being considered for applica-
tions as drivers in Laser Wakeﬁeld Accelerators (LWFA). Shaped lasers provide the
means of controlling the generation of plasma wake and thus oﬀer the possibility
of optimization of wake excitation and accelerating eﬃciency. However, progress
in ﬁnding “the optimal” shape has been hindered by the apparent complexity of
the problem. Not only is the parameter space of possible shape functions huge,
but also the generated wakeﬁeld is a nonlinear function of laser intensity, requir-
ing numerical solution of diﬀerential equations in a variational calculation. As a
result, several groups turned to trial and error methods such as genetic algorithms
for optimization [2,3]. Still, even these methods require consistent classiﬁcation
of laser shapes so that diﬀerent pulses can be meaningfully cross-compared while
desired properties such as wake amplitude or eﬃciency are optimized. In this paper
we reanalyze the process of wake generation and argue that the only two physical

parameters that describe a laser shape from the stand point of wake excitation are
the total pulse energy and its depletion length. Using these parameters we ﬁnd the
analytic expression for the family of optimal laser shapes that maximize both the
wakeﬁeld and the accelerating eﬃciency. We also develop a method for determining
the shape of a laser that produces a required value of wakeﬁeld without explicitly
solving the wake equation. This opens the way for obtaining laser shapes that
satisfy other optimization criteria speciﬁc to given experimental conditions.

ENERGY TRANSFER IN LWFA

Wakeﬁeld accelerators such as the laser-driven LWFA [4] or electron beam driven
Plasma Wakeﬁeld Accelerator (PWFA) [5] can be viewed as two-step energy trans-
fer systems: in the ﬁrst step the driver deposits energy into wake excitation of the
plasma, and in the second step the energy is taken from the wake by the accel-
erating beam. While the second step is the same for both accelerating schemes,
the physics of driver energy deposition is quite diﬀerent between them. In PWFA
the electron beam loses energy to the plasma through interaction with the in-
duced electrostatic ﬁeld, while in the LWFA laser energy loss occurs via photon
red-shift or deceleration [6]. This process can be understood as follows. Podero-
motive force of the laser modiﬁes both the density ne and the Lorentz factor γ
of the plasma electrons. This produces modulations in the nonlinear index of the
refraction η ≡ [1 − (ωp/ω)2ne/γnp]1/2, where ωp ≡ q4πe2np/me is the unper-
turbed plasma frequency, and ω is the frequency of the laser. The wake-induced
modulations of the refractive index appear stationary in the reference frame co-
moving with the laser and cause laser photons to red- or blue-shift depending on
the sign of refractive index gradient [7]. Due to negligible scattering in the set-
ting of laser accelerators, the photon number in the laser is essentially constant,
and the energy deposition into the plasma is therefore determined by the pho-
ton deceleration. To address this quantitatively we consider a laser propagating
along the z axis with initial frequency ω0 ≫ ωp. In the laser comoving frame, the
plasma response can be written in terms of the independent dimensionless variables
ζ = kp(z − vgt) and τ = kpct, where kp is the plasma wavenumber, and vg ≈ −c
is the laser group velocity (for convenience, the laser is moving in the negative z
direction). Introducing dimensionless normalized scalar and vector potentials φ(ζ)
and a(ζ), the parallel and perpendicular electric ﬁelds are Ek = −(mc2kp/e)∂φ/∂ζ
and E⊥ = −(mc/e)∂a/∂t = −(mc2kp/e)∂a/∂ζ. The wakeﬁeld generation equation
can then be written as [8,9]:

(1)

where x ≡ 1+φ is the modiﬁed electrostatic potential, and a2(ζ) is the dimensionless
laser intensity envelope averaged over fast oscillations. Prior to the arrival of the

laser the normalized wakeﬁeld E ≡ eEk/mcωp = −dx/dζ is zero. A formal solution
for the electric ﬁeld outside the laser can be written as the ﬁrst integral of (1):
[E out(ζ)]2 = −(x − 1)2/x+R ∞

This expression can be understood in terms of the deposition of laser energy into

The energy density in the wake from (2) can then be interpreted as the intensity-
weighted integral of the photon deceleration throughout the pulse. Let’s denote
the wake-dependent part of the photon deceleration function as κ(ζ) ≡ x′/x2. The
value of the peak wakeﬁeld in (2) is then bounded from above by the total laser
energy (the integral of a2) and the maximum photon deceleration κmax:

(4)

where κmax is the maximum of κ(ζ) inside the laser. Maximum photon decelera-
tion κmax actually has a simple physical interpretation. It is closely related to the
characteristic laser depletion length ld, or the distance in which the maximally de-
celerated laser slice red-shifts down to ωp (assuming no evolution of the wakeﬁeld).
From (3) this characteristic depletion length is:

ld = [(ω0/ωp)2 − 1]/kpκmax.

(5)

The peak wakeﬁeld outside the laser then scales with depletion length ld and di-
max ≤ q[(ω0/ωp)2 − 1]ε0/kpld. The
mensionless pulse energy ε0 ≡ R ∞
range of achievable wakeﬁelds is therefore set by the total pulse energy and its
depletion length. For pulses of ﬁxed energy and depletion length the actual value
of the wakeﬁeld within this range will depend only on particular laser shape, and
can be optimized by varying the shape subject to constraints.

WAKEFIELD OPTIMIZATION

One possible optimization problem can be formulated as follows: given some
ﬁxed laser energy ε0 and the desired depletion length (κmax = κ0), what laser
shape would produce the largest possible wakeﬁeld? According to (4) this amounts
to ﬁnding a shape that maintains the largest κ(ζ) for the duration of the pulse.
Since the maximum κ(ζ) is ﬁxed by the depletion length, such a shape should have

FIGURE 1. General shape of the nonlinear optimal laser intensity proﬁle and its corresponding
wakeﬁeld (arbitrary units)

a constant photon deceleration throughout the pulse, κ(ζ) = κ0.
If the laser is
present for ζ > 0, then in order to satisfy the boundary condition of quiescent
plasma before the laser, the photon deceleration should rise from 0 to value κ0 at
the very beginning of the pulse, e.g., like a step-function: κ(ζ) = κ0θ(ζ +). Here,
ζ + ≡ ζ − 0+ in order to avoid ambiguities with the values of step-function at 0.
The corresponding laser proﬁle is then found from the wake equation (1):

(6)

where ζ ∈ [0, ζf < 1/κ0], and δ(ζ +) is a delta-function such that R ζ>0

δ(y+)dy = 1.
A schematic drawing of the optimal laser intensity variation and its associated
plasma wakeﬁeld are shown in Fig. 1. Generally, the shape consists of a δ-function
at the front followed by a ramp in intensity which is cut oﬀ at ζf . In the linear
regime, when a2 ≪ 1, κ0 → 0, the ramp reduces to a triangular shape found
in [11,12]: a2 = 2κ0(δ(ζ +) + ζ). We note that (6) describes a family of shapes,
rather than a ﬁxed shape. The actual proﬁle of the optimal pulse depends on the
deceleration parameter κ0 set by the desired depletion length and the pulse length
ζf , which is determined from the available total energy:

ε0 = 2κ0 +

.

(7)

Although the pulse length cannot exceed ζc ≡ 1/κ0, the rise of a2 towards the
end of the pulse guarantees that any ﬁnite laser energy can be accommodated for
ζf < ζc. The two terms in (7) represent the energy contained in the δ-function
precursor and the main pulse. It is clear that for a ﬁxed total energy there exists
a maximum value of κ0 = ε0/2 which is achieved when ζf → 0, i.e., all of the
energy is concentrated in the δ-function. This shape, which is a particular case of
the general optimal shape (6), excites the largest possible wakeﬁeld and has the

smallest depletion length among all pulses of ﬁxed energy. For circularly polarized
pulses with cylindrical transverse crossection of radius r0 and wavelength λ, the
maximum achievable wake is then given by:

where U0 is the total pulse energy (in Joules) and Ewb = 96[np/1018cm−3]GV/m is
the nonrelativistic wavebreaking ﬁeld.

EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATION

While generation of large accelerating gradients is a prerequisite for a successful
accelerating scheme, the eﬃciency of acceleration should also be considered. For
an accelerating scheme that involves transfer of energy from the driver beam to
the accelerating beam, eﬃciency is measured in terms of the transformer ratio, or
the ratio of the maximum rate of energy gain per particle of accelerating beam
to the maximum rate of energy loss per particle of the driving beam. In the case
of laser-plasma accelerators, where the driving and accelerating beams consist of
particles of diﬀerent species, the following kinematic deﬁnition is more useful:

R ≡

|∂γa/∂z|max
|∂γd/∂z|max

,

(9)

where γd and γa are Lorentz factors for the driving and accelerating beams.
In
LWFA the particles in the trailing electron bunch are accelerated via electrostatic
interaction with the wake, so |∂γa/∂z|max = |eEmax
max|. For the
laser propagating in plasma γd ≈ ω/ωp, so |∂γd/∂z| is the photon frequency shift
given by (3). The transformer ratio for LWFA is then:

|/mec2 = kp|E out

RLWFA =

2ω

|∂x/∂ζ|out
max
|∂(1/x)/∂ζ|in

maxkpld.

(10)

Deﬁned this way the transformer ratio can have several interpretations. On the
one hand, it is a measure of local accelerating eﬃciency, or the amount of increase
in γ of the accelerating electron per unit loss of γ of the laser. On the other hand,
transformer ratio is proportional to the maximum energy that can be transferred
to the accelerating beam particle over the laser depletion length (assuming no
evolution of the wake during propagation). Therefore, an eﬃcient accelerating
scheme should attempt to maximize the transformer ratio.

There are several ways to ﬁnd the laser shape that maximizes R. Among the
pulses of ﬁxed energy and depletion length, R is maximized by a pulse that produces
the largest wakeﬁeld as can be seen from (10). The optimal shape found in Eq. (6)
satisﬁes this requirement. Alternatively, one can relax the energy constraint and

instead look for a laser proﬁle that has the largest depletion length among all the
shapes that produce a given maximum wakeﬁeld behind the laser. Although this
reasoning leads to the same resulting shape, we include the proof for completeness
as it demonstrates a useful technique for determining laser shapes that satisfy
constraints on the values of the wakeﬁeld.

In order to ﬁnd the shape that maximizes the transformer ratio, we vary the
photon deceleration function κ(ζ) inside the laser. We require that κ(ζ) be positive
deﬁnite, i.e., laser photons only lose energy to the plasma and do not reabsorb
energy from the wake. The advantage of varying κ(ζ) rather than a2(ζ) directly
is that one can immediately write down the solution for the wakeﬁeld potential
−∞ κ(ζ1)dζ1, i.e.,
x(ζ) = 1/(1 − ψ(ζ)). The corresponding laser shape is then determined from the
wakeﬁeld equation (1):

x(ζ) in terms of the photon energy deposition function ψ(ζ) ≡ R ζ

a2(ζ) = (2x′′(ζ) + 1)x(ζ)2 − 1 =

2ψ′′(ζ)

[1 − ψ(ζ)]4 +

4ψ′(ζ)2
[1 − ψ(ζ)]5 +

1

[1 − ψ(ζ)]2 − 1. (11)

Note that not all functions ψ(ζ) should produce physical, i.e., positive a2(ζ),
and the validity of a given κ(ζ) should be checked through (11). By considering
photon energy deposition in the pulse all possible laser shapes that produce a
given wakeﬁeld can be mapped onto a bounded space of monotonically increasing
functions ψ(ζ), whose end values on the interval [0, ζf ] and derivatives at ζf are
constrained by the required maximum value of the wakeﬁeld. From the ﬁrst integral
of the wakeﬁeld equation we can relate the modiﬁed potential xf ≡ x(ζf ) and the
electric ﬁeld x′

f ≡ x′(ζf ) evaluated at the end of the pulse:

(E out

xf

+ (x′

f )2 =

ψ(ζf )2

(1 − ψ(ζf ))

+

ψ′(ζf )2

(1 − ψ(ζf ))4 .

(12)

Monotonicity of ψ(ζ) follows from the requirement κ(ζ) ≥ 0, and the bounds
on ψ(ζ) are 0 = ψ(0) ≤ ψ(ζ) ≤ ψmax < 1. A few sample solutions for ψ(ζ) and
corresponding photon deceleration and laser shapes are plotted in Fig. 2. The func-
tion ψ(ζ) that results in the largest transformer ratio should possess the smallest
maximal slope in the interval [0, ζf ] – this will maximize the depletion length for
a ﬁxed E out
max. Such curve is unique and is represented by curve 2 in ﬁgure 2. It
is a straight line with slope ψ′(ζf ) = ψ(ζf )crit/ζf , where the value of ψ(ζf )crit is
determined from substituting ψ′(ζf ) into eq. (12). Let’s show that this line has the
smallest maximum slope. Since ψ′(ζf ) is a decreasing function of ψ(ζf ) for a ﬁxed
E out
max (eq. (12)), all curves ψ(ζ) with ψ(ζf ) < ψ(ζf )crit (such as curve 1 in ﬁgure 2)
will automatically have larger slope at ζf : ψ′(ζ) > ψ(ζf )crit/ζf . On the other hand,
the curves with ψ(ζf ) > ψ(ζf )crit (such as curves 3 and 4) should have a slope larger
than ψ(ζf )crit somewhere between 0 and ζf in order to be larger than ψ(ζf )crit at
ζf . We therefore prove that the function ψ(ζ) = κ0ζ, where κ0 ≡ ψ(ζf )crit/ζf , is an
integrated photon deceleration proﬁle that maximizes the transformer ratio.

The photon deceleration function associated with this ψ(ζ) is a constant κ(ζ) =
κ0 and the resulting laser shape is the same as given by (6). The optimal trans-
former ratio associated with this shape can be found from (10):

where Lp = ζf /kp is the pulse length. In the linear regime optimal transformer
ratios for both LWFA and PWFA schemes scale identically with the pulse/beam
length: RLWFA → (2ω/ωp)q1 + (kpLpulse)2, RPWFA → q1 + (kpLbeam)2 [13]. The
LWFA scheme is intrinsically more eﬃcient by a factor of 2ω/ωp, which is needed for
viability of LWFA since lasers are typically “slower” drivers than electron beams.

UTILITY OF PULSE SHAPING

The advantage of using the optimal pulse shape is best seen in comparison with
the unshaped (Gaussian) pulse. For a given Gaussian pulse (or any other non-
optimal shape) one can always construct a corresponding optimally shaped pulse
with the same laser energy such that the photon deceleration across the optimal
pulse equals to the peak photon deceleration in the unshaped one (i.e., both pulses
have equal depletion lengths). Unshaped pulses deplete ﬁrst in the region where
photon deceleration is the largest, whereas a laser with the optimal shape loses all
its energy in a depletion length due to uniform photon deceleration, thus enhanc-
ing instantaneous energy deposition and wakeﬁeld. For a numerical example, we
consider the optimal and Gaussian pulses of total energy 0.5J, wavelength 1µm and
cylindrical radius 10µm in a plasma with np = 1018cm−3. The transformer ratio,
the maximum wakeﬁeld, the required pulse length, and the corresponding peak a0
are shown in Fig. 3 as a function of depletion length.

FIGURE 3. Comparison of the transformer ratio, maximum wakeﬁeld, pulse length, and maxi-
mum normalized vector potential in shaped (diamonds) and Gaussian (triangles) pulses of equal
depletion lengths and constant pulse energy of 0.5J.

From Fig. 3 we see that the transformer ratio and the maximum wakeﬁeld are
consistently larger for shaped pulses. In fact, the lines for optimal pulse wakeﬁeld
and transformer ratio represent the theoretical upper limits for all pulses of given
energy. The Gaussian pulse achieves a maximum transformer ratio when its length
(measured here as FWHM) equals 1/2 of the relativistic plasma wavelength. The
eﬀects of shaping are especially prominent for longer pulses, where Gaussian pulse
yields almost no wake excitation due to plasma oscillations inside the pulse that
cause part of the laser photons to absorb energy from the wake. On the other
hand, a shaped laser postpones plasma oscillation until the end of the pulse, and
all photons decelerate uniformly. For very short pulses, the diﬀerences between the
two shapes are minimal. This is due to the fact that very short Gaussian pulses of
ﬁxed energy asymptotically approach the delta-function limit of the short optimal
shape. For these short pulses the wakeﬁeld attains the maximum value given by
(8) as the depletion length reaches the minimal value for given pulse energy.

Although short pulses generally produce the largest wakeﬁelds, their eﬃciency is
close to minimal possible, as the depletion length decreases faster than increase in
the wake. Therefore, the choice of the appropriate pulse shape for LWFA stage will
depend on speciﬁc experimental conditions. If the laser-plasma interaction distance
is limited by instabilities, diﬀraction or dephasing, then in order to maximize the
electron energy gain one should try to achieve the largest accelerating gradient,
which can be accomplished with ultrashort pulses. For some regimes of plasma

density and laser energy available laser systems may be unable to produce pulses
short enough so that the pump depletion length is longer than the characteristic
instability or dephasing length.
In this case shaping the laser will increase the
wakeﬁeld over the interaction distance, even though it will be below the maximum
possible if a shorter pulse were used. If the interaction length is less constrained,
such as the case for propagation in plasma channels [14], then using a ﬁnite-length
shaped pulse will result in a greatly improved overall energy gain per stage as
can be seen from Fig. 3. An added beneﬁt of pulse shaping is the suppression of
modulational instability that aﬀects unshaped pulses that are longer than plasma
wavelength. When all photons red-shift, or “slow down”, at the same rate, diﬀerent
slices of the laser do not overrun each other, and the 1D laser self-modulation is
suppressed.

REALISTIC PULSE SHAPING

As the optimal pulse shape is associated with a delta-function precursor, the
feasibility of such a structure may be a concern. We note that the purpose of this
precursor is to bring the photon deceleration from zero in the quiescent plasma
before the laser to a ﬁnite value κ0 at the beginning of the main pulse. This can
also be achieved with a more physical prepulse, whose shape can be found from the
wake equation once a smooth function κ(ζ) is chosen.

For our example we choose a photon deceleration function that varies as a
hyperbolic tangent: κ(ζ) = κ0[1 + tanh(α(ζ − ζ0))]/2, where α is a steepness
parameter and ζ0 is an arbitrary oﬀset. The photon energy deposition is then
ψ(ζ) = κ0[ζ + ln(cosh(α(ζ − ζ0)))/α]/2, and the corresponding laser shape is found
from equation (11):

a2(ζ) =

κ0αsech2(α(ζ − ζ0))

+

κ2
0[1 + tanh(α(ζ − ζ0))]2

− 1,

(14)

where ζ ≤ ζf and the function in the denominator is χ(ζ) = 1 + (κ0/2α) ln 1
2 +
ζ0κ0/2 − ψ(ζ). As before, the pulse length ζf can be found from the total available
energy of the pulse. By varying α we can change the slope of κ(ζ) as it rises
from 0 to κ0 and construct a pulse shape that satisﬁes experimental constraints
yet retains essential physics of the optimal shape. For a step-function photon
deceleration (α → ∞) expression (14) asymptotes to equation (6). However, for
ﬁnite values of α the delta-function precursor spreads out and can even disappear
as shown in Fig. 4. The family of shapes given by (14) is better suited for the ﬁnite-
bandwidth laser systems that have a lower limit on achievable feature size. The
values of maximum wakeﬁeld for pulses in Fig. 4 is within few percent of the value
for a delta-function optimal pulse of the same energy and depletion length. This is
due to the fact that the bulk of the laser pulse still experiences constant maximal
photon deceleration. The wakeﬁeld further degrades with longer rise times of κ(ζ).

The pulse shaping techniques described so far have assumed that the laser is
incident on an unperturbed plasma. However, this does not have to be the case, and
we can construct an optimally-shaped laser that enters the plasma at some phase
of a pre-existing plasma oscillation. Such oscillation could be left from a precursor
laser pulse or electron beam as shown in Fig. 5. When there is an existing plasma
wave, the value x0 of the modiﬁed electrostatic potential at the beginning of the
optimal pulse will generally be diﬀerent from unity. In this case the expression for
the optimal pulse without the delta-function precursor is modiﬁed into:

where we assume that the main pulse lies between ζ0 and ζf , and κ0 = x′(ζ0)/x2
0.
If this shape is placed in a correct phase of the oscillation (so that a2
l (ζ0) from
(15) is positive), it acts as an ampliﬁer of the existing wakeﬁeld. The ratio of
maximum wakeﬁeld behind the optimal pulse to the ﬁeld in front of it scales as
(R/x2
0)(ωp/2ω) which for pulse lengths around λp from Fig. 3 can be of order 10. A
detailed discussion of this scheme and a comparison to the resonant laser-plasma
accelerator concept [15] will be reported elsewhere.

DISCUSSION

As we have shown, the huge phase space involved in shaping laser drivers for
applications in laser wakeﬁeld accelerators can be described using only two param-
eters: total pulse energy and characteristic depletion length. The shape of photon
energy deposition (photon deceleration) inside the pulse plays a crucial role for
both the wake excitation and the evolution of the laser driver. By varying the
shape of the photon deceleration function for pulses of ﬁxed energy and depletion
length we were able to optimize both the generated wakeﬁeld and the eﬃciency of

the accelerating scheme. The method used for obtaining the optimal shapes (6)
and (14) is actually more general and can be used to determine laser shapes that
generate other variations in the nonlinear index of refraction. Having a physical
requirement for the refractive index, which in this case is the requirement of uni-
formity of photon deceleration, provides a constraint on the functional form of the
wakeﬁeld, which can then be used to ﬁnd the required laser shape. Alas, such a
“reverse” solution is not always guaranteed to yield a physical (i.e., positive) a2(ζ),
so, in general, caution is advised.

Several issues should be addressed before the laser pulse shaping concept can
be fully utilized. Even without the delta-function precursor, the ﬁnite laser band-
width will necessarily smooth out steep rises and falls of the optimal pulse shape.
Although we do not anticipate adverse eﬀects when the feature size is much smaller
than the plasma wavelength, the 1D self-consistent laser evolution and stability of
realistic optimal shapes are currently under investigation. Another consideration
is the inﬂuence of the laser-plasma interaction in the transverse dimension on the
evolution of the pulse. Many of the laser-plasma instabilities are seeded by the
wakeﬁeld-induced perturbations of the index of refraction. As we have demon-
strated in this paper, the nonlinear index of refraction can be eﬀectively controlled
through laser shaping, thus suggesting the method of delaying the onset of these in-
stabilities. Whether this approach increases the growth rates of other instabilities,
particularly in the transverse dimension, remains to be investigated.

We would like to thank J. Arons, A. Charman, T. Katsouleas, W. B. Mori, and

J. Wurtele for fruitful discussions and suggestions.

Improved ﬁnal doublet designs for the ILC baseline small
crossing angle scheme

R. Appleby∗, P. Bambade†

November 27, 2012

Abstract

The ILC baseline consists of two interaction regions, one with a 20mrad crossing
angle and the other with a 2mrad crossing angle. It is known that the outgoing
beam losses in the ﬁnal doublet and subsequent extraction line are larger in the
2mrad than in the 20mrad layout.
In this work, we exploit NbTi and Nb3Sn
superconducting magnet technologies to redesign and optimise the ﬁnal doublet,
with the aim of providing satisfactory outgoing disrupted beam power losses in
this region. We present three new ﬁnal doublet layouts, speciﬁcally optimised for
the 500 GeV and the 1 TeV machines.

1 INTRODUCTION

The current baseline conﬁguration of the International Linear Collider [1] consists of two
interaction regions (IRs) and two detectors, with one IR having a large beam crossing
angle and one having a small beam crossing angle. The large crossing angle layout has
an angle of 20mrad between the beams, and is derived from the large crossing angle
design of the Next Linear Collider [2]. Its optical properties are well understood, and
the extraction line successfully transports the disrupted beam to the dump, for a wide
range of proposed beam parameter sets [3]. Furthermore, the design includes down-
stream diagnostics for energy and polarisation measurement. The 2mrad interaction
region layout presents more technical challenges, mainly resulting from transporting the
outgoing disrupted beam oﬀ-axis in the ﬁnal doublet. This design is more recent and the
ﬁrst complete optics were presented at Snowmass 2005 [4]. This layout was developed
for 1 TeV using NbTi superconducting ﬁnal doublet magnets and included downstream
energy and polarimetry measurement chicanes.

The current ILC parameter space is documented in [5] and the key parameters are
listed in Table 1. These consist of sets of representative beam parameters, designed to
assure ﬂexibility in case of unexpected practical limitations in achieving some of the
machine goals. The most challenging of these sets is known as the High Luminosity
set, which aims to maximise the instantaneous luminosity by more strongly focusing
the beams at the IP, thereby signiﬁcantly enhancing disruption eﬀects. A necessary
criterion for the performance of the extraction line design is its ability to accommodate
the broadest possible range of beam parameters. The 20mrad scheme is successful for the
majority of parameter sets, but the current (baseline) 2mrad design shows unacceptable
beam power loss, both in the ﬁnal doublet and in the extraction line, for some of the
beam parameters considered.

In this work, we exploit the limits of current magnet technology as well as technology
still under development to optimise the 2mrad ﬁnal doublet layout. We present three
new ﬁnal doublet designs, one optimised for the baseline energy of 500 GeV and two
for the upgrade energy of 1 TeV. We optimise the magnet parameters with respect to
power deposition from charged beam and radiative Bhabha particle losses, with the goal
of accommodating all ILC beam parameter sets. We ﬁnd that this is possible by using
NbTi technology for the 500 GeV machine, and by using new Nb3Sn technology for the
1 TeV upgrade. However, an increase in pole tip ﬁeld, somewhat beyond the currently
planned limits for Nb3Sn technology, would be required to achieve power losses small
enough to avoid quenching of the ﬁnal doublet magnets for the case of the Low Power
and High Luminosity beam parameters at 1 TeV. We include a full set of magnet and
optical parameters for evaluation by magnet designers.

In Section 2 we discuss the available magnet technologies and the constraints we place
on magnet parameters. We describe our ﬁnal doublet optimisation procedure in Section 3
and present the resulting magnet parameters for each case. The beam transport and
resulting losses with our new doublets are presented in Section 4, and we draw our
conclusions in Section 5. We ﬁnd that the proposed new ﬁnal doublet layouts have
considerably better beam transport properties than the current ones.

2 MAGNET PARAMETERS

2.1 Current baseline design

The ﬁnal doublet in the 2mrad scheme is based a superconductive large bore QD0
magnet and on a normal conducting smaller aperture QF0 magnet. The two nearby
sextupoles for local chromaticity correction, SD0 and SF1, are also superconductive
In the current design, the choice of superconductive technology
large bore magnets.
for QD0 is NbTi and the maximum pole tip ﬁeld which is assumed to be achievable is
5.6 T. In this work we always take l∗ to be 4.5m and the QD-QF distance to be 9m.
The outgoing beam passes through the coil pocket of QF1, where the ﬁeld is modelled
by a standard multipole expansion. The outer coil radius, which is available for beam
passage, is 115mm. In this design, the doublet was optimised for the TeV machine, and
the 500 GeV layout was obtained by scaling down the ﬁelds.

2.2 Maximum pole tip ﬁeld for NbTi

For the NbTi magnets [6] considered in this work, we assume a maximum pole tip ﬁeld
of 6.28 T. This is around the maximum ﬁeld that current coil designs can produce,
and includes the ﬁeld-reducing eﬀects of the external solenoid and a safety magin [7].
This corresponds to a gradient of 180 T m−1 in a magnet of radial aperture 35mm. The
sextupoles are required to be large bore superconducting magnets, to allow the transport
of the outgoing beam. We follow the technology choice of the current design, and adopt
a maximum ﬁeld of 4.04T in SD0 and 2.13T in SF1 (with radial apertures of 88mm and
112mm, respectively)1.

2.3 Expected maximum pole tip ﬁeld for Nb3Sn

We also propose to use Nb3Sn-based technology [6] for QD0 at 1 TeV. The higher
gradient permitted by this magnet will improve the beam transport properties of the
doublet, by allowing a more compact design. These magnets have yet to be proven,

1The maximum ﬁeld in a sextupole probably has some dependance on its aperture. This point should

be checked with experts, to assess the feasibility of our proposed magnets.

but in the timescales of the ILC TeV upgrade, should hopefully be readily available2.
Of course, such an upgrade would require replacing the ﬁnal doublet, but this is rather
minor on the scale of the 1 TeV energy upgrade. Furthermore the geometry of the
extraction line would need to be maintained. The maximum pole tip ﬁeld which we
assume will be achievable with Nb3Sn is 8.75T (taking into account the presence of a
solenoid background ﬁeld). This corresponds to a 250 T m−1 gradient for a 35mm radial
aperture.

2.4 Outline of doublet designs

In this work, we propose three new doublet layouts. We shall optimise the layout for the
500 GeV machine, using NbTi for QD0 at a maximum pole tip ﬁeld of 6.28 T. The beam
transport properties of such a layout will be considerably better that the scaled down
version of the 1 TeV existing baseline, because the magnet length can be reduced. The
sextupoles shall be optimised versions of the current baseline. We shall then calculate
the layouts for the TeV machine, ﬁrstly using NbTi for QD0 as the design for 500 GeV,
and secondly with Nb3Sn. The resulting doublets are intended to replace the present
design.

The current baseline magnets are summarised in Table 2. In Table 3 we describe our

proposed magnet technology limits for this work.

2.5 Assumed power deposition tolerances

Superconductive magnets will quench if too much beam power is deposited in them, and
both integrated power and localised power density tolerances have been speciﬁed by the
CERN group for the LHC quadrupoles used in this work. The maximum integrated
power which can be tolerated per unit length is in the range 5-10 W m−1. However,
for a few speciﬁc magnets like those in the ﬁnal doublet, this tolerance can presumably
be relaxed a bit if more cryogenic power can be used. The highest localised power
density which can be accepted is 0.5 mW g−1. This tolerance is important to consider

2The development of superconductive magnets based on Nb3Sn technology is also being strongly
stimulated by the LHC luminosity upgrade programme, which also requires higher gradients for its
low-beta insertion quadrupoles.

in this work because the outgoing beam is transported oﬀ-axis through several of the
ﬁnal doublet magnets, and so particles at the lower end of the energy distribution can
get over-focused onto the edge of the magnet aperture on one side. Since these particles
are essentially concentrated in a plane (except for their vertical angular spread), the
local power density can become high. We rely on detailed computations performed at
RHUL with the GEANT-4 based BDSIM simulation [8], following similar calculations
at SLAC [9]. These calculations have shown that for about 1 W incident beam power on
the edge of QD0, a maximum power density of about 4 mW g−1 can be reached inside
the NbTi coils. If a 3 mm Tungsten liner (corresponding to about 1 radiation length)
is used to thicken the beam pipe and spread out the showers at the location of the loss,
the maximum power density can be brought down to about 0.3 mW g−1 in the same
conditions. Based on these numbers, we use 1 W as the maximum value for the power
0.3 mW g−1 equivalence, found between
deposited on the edge of QD0. This 1 W
↔
total incident power and power density in QD0, will have to be checked for other magnet
conﬁgurations and beam parameters, especially in the case of the sextupoles.

3 FINAL DOUBLET OPTIMISATION

In this section, we shall discuss our optimisation of the ﬁnal doublet layout. We shall
start with the optimisation of QD0. Several studies of the power deposition into QD0
have shown that the charged beam loss and the loss from radiative Bhabhas exceed the
quench limits of the coils, for some of the proposed beam parameters. Therefore, the goal
of our optimisation is to reduce these losses to acceptable levels, for all beam parameters.
Note that we work in terms of total incident power, and consider the conversion to
localised losses separately (see Section 2.5). The optimisation procedure described in
the following is applied to all three ﬁnal doublet designs outlined in Section 2.

The underlaying principle is, in the ﬁrst instance, to make the magnet as short as pos-
sible within the constraints of the available pole tip ﬁeld. Hence we begin by increasing
the ﬁeld of QD0 to the maximum possible value, and decrease the length in proportion.
We the perform a scan of the aperture and pole tip ﬁeld, adjusting the length to main-
tain the overall focusing strength, and using the total power deposition from the diﬀerent

beam parameter sets as ﬁgure of merit. The magnitude of the beamstrahlung energy
loss for the Low Power and High Luminosity beam parameters it such that these sets
dominate the optimisation. Both the eﬀects from the charged beam, for vertical oﬀsets
at the interaction point maximising the beamstrahlung losses, and the combined eﬀects
of radiative Bhabhas and the charged beam (collided in this case without a signiﬁcant
vertical oﬀset) are considered. We generally ﬁnd a mimimum in the total power deposi-
tion which is very similar for all parameters sets, as the dependance of the total power
versus aperture and length found from the scanning is rather shallow. This procedure
allows a power-optimised QD0 length, aperture and pole tip ﬁeld, with the constraints
of maintaining the constant integrated focusing strength needed to achieve the required
demagniﬁcation and keeping the pole tip below a given assumption on the maximum
value achievable. Note that the former constraint maintains the demagniﬁcation of the
ﬁnal telescope, and also maintains the integrated strength of QF1. To ensure that the
mimimum we reach in the 3-dimensinal space of the scan is a true and global minimum,
we begin with a variety of initial magnet conditions (i.e. origin in our space). We ﬁnd
that we always converge to the same point in all cases. We perform this optimisation
for the three cases we consider in this work and the result is a set of three QD0-QF1
systems.

Once QD0 has been optimised, we can ﬁt for the local chromaticity correction sex-
tupoles. For these sextupoles, located in the immediate vicinity of the ﬁnal doublet
quadrupoles, we assume the same maximum pole tip ﬁelds as in the baseline. The chro-
maticity is corrected by zeroing the T126 and T346 matrix elements across the system,
with dispersion obtained by requiring η′
10mrad at the interaction point. Note that
−
the latter value is chosen to give acceptable sextupole strengths, whilst keeping below
the intrinsic beam angular divergence. The inter-magnet distances chosen are shown in
Table 4. In this work, the optics code MAD [10] was used to compute the chromaticity
correction.

x =

To optimise the sextupole apertures, a ﬁt is performed, within the maximal value
assumed for the pole tip ﬁelds, and requiring no loss when transporting a Nominal,
Low Power or High Luminosity beam. The technological constraints limit the maximum
aperture, and we ﬁt the aperture by requiring no loss when transporting a nominal, low
power or high luminosity beam. The available aperture is computed from the quadratic
rise of the ﬁeld in the beampipe of the sextupole. Note that we consider both the
radiative Bhabha contribution and the eﬀect of a vertically oﬀset beam. The requirement
of small enough loss (1 W in total) is very stringent, particularly in the case of the
High Luminosity oﬀset beams, and results in large sextupole apertures. These could
be considerably reduced by relaxing the beam transport requirement, for instance if one
would avoid beam parameter optimisations with very large beamstrahlung energy losses.
The results of the optimisation can be found in table 5 for NbTi at 500 GeV, in table 6
for NbTi at 1 TeV and in table 7 for Nb3Sn at 1 TeV. These tables show the magnet
parameters of the two quadrupoles and two sextupoles making up the ﬁnal doublet
layout.

4 PARTICLE LOSSES IN THE OPTIMISED FINAL

DOUBLET

In this section, power depositions from particle losses are computed for the three opti-
mised ﬁnal doublets described in Section 2. For completeness we include the power losses
for the current baseline layout, both at 500 GeV and 1 TeV. The disrupted beam was
calculated using the beam-beam simulator GUINEA-PIG [11], with the beam parame-
ters taken from [3, 5], and the particle ray-tracing was performed using the programme
DIMAD [12]. We ﬁnd that it is necessary to primarily consider the Low power and High
Luminosity beam parameter sets, due to their high beamstrahlung energy loss. We also
conservatively consider the transport of the disrupted beam for collisions with vertical
oﬀsets chosen to maximise the corresponding beamstrahlung energy loss. Such oﬀsets,

typically of about a hundred microns, are expected in the course of tuning the acceler-
ator, in particular during the settling of the trajectory feedback system at the IP. For
the normal luminosity-producing zero oﬀset collisions, the eﬀect of radiative Bhabha
processes is included. We use 1.28 million macroparticles to represent the disrupted
charged beam. This resulting minimum power loss is of order 0.5 to 1 W, which can
hence be considered as the upper bound for cases with zero particle loss3. The radiative
Bhabha losses, on the other hand, are not statistics limited.

4.1 Results for E=500 GeV

In Table 8 we show, for reference, the power losses for the baseline lattice at 500 GeV.
This lattice is obtained by scaling down the 1 TeV magnet parameters. Table 9 shows the
power losses for the optimised 500 GeV NbTi lattice, produced following the procedure
described in Section 3 and using the limits for the magnet parameters listed in Table 3.
Note that the outer pocket radius of QF1 was increased by 1mm (from 115mm to 116mm)
to accommodate the charged beam of the high luminosity parameter set with a vertical
oﬀset. Comparison of the performance of the baseline ﬁnal doublet at 500 GeV, Table 8,
with the performance of the new NbTi doublet optimised for 500 GeV, Table 9, shows
the beneﬁt of the new ﬁnal doublet layout. The power losses for all parameter sets
are greatly reduced and, following the arguments about quenching of superconducting
magnets in Section 2, the power losses should be small enough for successful beam
transport to be achieved.

Figure 1 illustrates how much the power losses would be further reduced if research
and development provided a stronger (i.e. larger) magnetic gradient. This curve shows
the power deposition from radiative Bhabhas for the High Luminosity beam parameter
set, as a function of magnet scale factor for the optimised NbTi 500 GeV ﬁnal doublet
(solid curve) and the same magnet with an extra 20% of gradient in QD0.

Figure 2 shows the power deposition from radiative Bhabhas for the Low Power beam
parameter set, as a function of the QD0 aperture4 . The minimum in the power loss

magnet. Note that also including the charged beam losses may move this total minimum
to slightly larger aperture.

4.2 Results for E=1 TeV

In Table 10 we show, for reference, the power losses for the baseline lattice at 1 TeV.
Table 11 shows the power losses in the NbTi ﬁnal doublet, optimised for 1 TeV. The low
maximum gradient possible with this magnet technology means that, whilst the losses
are lower than the baseline design at 1 TeV, they are still too high to avoid magnet
quenching. This indicates that higher gradient magnets are required.

Finally, Table 12 shows the power losses in the Nb3Sn ﬁnal doublet, optimised for 1
TeV. The higher gradients expected from using Nb3Sn superconductive material enable
to signiﬁcantly reduce the power deposition as compared to both the baseline and opti-
mised NbTi ﬁnal doublet designs. However, the losses are still in excess of the quenching

limits of the magnets. To understand what improvement in superconducting technology
would be required, we computed how much larger the pole tip ﬁeld in QD0 would need
to be to bring the sum of the charged beam and radiative Bhabha losses to less than 1W,
for the Low Power beam parameter set. The result was that a pole tip ﬁeld of 11T in a
magnet with an aperture of 35mm would be needed for the Low Power beam parameter
set to be accommodated in the ﬁnal doublet at 1 TeV. The feasibility of such large pole
tip ﬁelds on the time-scale of the 1 TeV energy upgrade of the ILC needs to be discussed
with relevant superconductive magnet experts. Alternatively, beam parameters at 1 TeV
may be optimised with somewhat lower beamstrahlung energy loss, including for total
beam powers as low as in the present Low Power parameter set. Such sets would result

5 CONCLUSIONS

In this note, we have described a detailed study of the power deposition in the ﬁnal dou-
blet of the ILC 2mrad crossing-angle layout, from both the disrupted charged beam and
from the radiative Bhabha events. We exploited superconductive magnet technologies

adequate to obtain small enough beam power depositions in the ﬁnal doublet, provided
a Tungsten liner is included in the design of the vacuum chamber to spread out the
showers and reduce the maximum power density at the location where most losses are
concentrated. This doublet now needs to be integrated into the ﬁnal focus system and
extraction line. When this will be done, we will propose that it become the baseline for
the 2mrad at E=500GeV, with the assumption that it would have to be replaced at the
time of the 1 TeV energy upgrade.

A ﬁnal doublet based on NbTi technology does not, on the other hand, provide small
enough beam power depositions at 1 TeV, for several of the beam parameter sets consid-
ered. Exploiting Nb3Sn superconductive technology can however improve the situation
considerably, as the higher expected gradients would allow signiﬁcantly lower power de-
positions. The optimised layout shows far superior power loss behavior than the current
1 TeV machine baseline ﬁnal doublet, but is still in excess of the quenching limit for the
beam parameter sets with the largest beamstrahlung energy loss. A 35mm QD0 with a
pole tip ﬁeld of around 11 T would be needed to a avoid quenching of this magnet, in
the case of the Low Power beam parameters.

We expect further R&D in superconductive magnet technology to enable increases in
maximum available pole tip ﬁeld in the future, which will ease the design of the 2mrad
beam crossing-angle layout. An alternative path is to constrain the optimisation of the
beam parameters at 1 TeV with an upper bound on the beamstrahlung energy loss. This
would also be motivated since a very large beamstrahlung energy loss is undesirable for
several other reasons.

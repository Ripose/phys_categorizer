Abstract

We present applications of variational–wavelet approach to nonlinear (ra-
tional) rms envelope equations. We have the solution as a multiresolution
(multiscales) expansion in the base of compactly supported wavelet basis. We
give extension of our results to the cases of periodic beam motion and arbi-
trary variable coeﬃcients. Also we consider more ﬂexible variational method
which is based on biorthogonal wavelet approach.

1 Introduction

In this paper we consider the applications of a new numerical-analytical tech-
nique which is based on the methods of local nonlinear Fourier analysis or
Wavelet analysis to the nonlinear beam/accelerator physics problems related
to root-mean-square (rms) envelope dynamics [1]. Such approach may be use-
ful in all models in which it is possible and reasonable to reduce all complicated
problems related with statistical distributions to the problems described by
systems of nonlinear ordinary/partial diﬀerential equations. In this paper we
consider approach based on the second moments of the distribution functions
for the calculation of evolution of rms envelope of a beam.

The rms envelope equations are the most useful for analysis of the beam
self–forces (space–charge) eﬀects and also allow to consider both transverse
and longitudinal dynamics of space-charge-dominated relativistic high–bright
ness axisymmetric/asymmetric beams, which under short laser pulse–driven
radio-frequency photoinjectors have fast transition from nonrelativistic to rel-
ativistic regime [2]-[3].

From the formal point of view we may consider rms envelope equations
after straightforward transformations to standard Cauchy form as a system of
nonlinear diﬀerential equations which are not more than rational (in dynam-
ical variables). Such rational type of nonlinearities allow us to consider some
extension of results from [4]-[12], which are based on application of wavelet
analysis technique to variational formulation of initial nonlinear problem.

Wavelet analysis is a relatively novel set of mathematical methods, which
gives us a possibility to work with well-localized bases in functional spaces and
give for the general type of operators (diﬀerential, integral, pseudodiﬀerential)
in such bases the maximum sparse forms.

An example of such type of basis is demonstrated on Fig. 1.
Our approach in this paper is based on the generalization [13] of variatio-
nal-wavelet approach from [4]-[12], which allows us to consider not only poly-
nomial but rational type of nonlinearities.

So, our variational-multiresolution approach gives us possibility to con-
struct explicit numerical-analytical solution for the following systems of non-
linear diﬀerential equations

˙z = R(z, t)

or Q(z, t) ˙z = P (z, t),

(1)

where z(t) = (z1(t), ..., zn(t)) is the vector of dynamical variables zi(t),

R(z, t) is not more than rational function of z,
P (z, t), Q(z, t) are not more than polynomial functions of z and P,Q,R

have arbitrary dependence of time.

2

The solution has the following form

z(t) = zslow

N (t) + Xj≥N

zj(ωjt), ωj ∼ 2j

(2)

N

which corresponds to the full multiresolution expansion in all time scales.
Formula (2) gives us expansion into a slow part zslow
and fast oscillating
parts for arbitrary N. So, we may move from coarse scales of resolution to
the ﬁnest one for obtaining more detailed information about our dynamical
process. The ﬁrst term in the RHS of equation (2) corresponds on the global
level of function space decomposition to resolution space and the second one
to detail space. In this way we give contribution to our full solution from each
scale of resolution or each time scale (detailed description we give in part
3.2 and numerical illustration in part 7 below). The same is correct for the
contribution to power spectral density (energy spectrum): we can take into
account contributions from each level/scale of resolution.

In part 2 we describe the diﬀerent forms of rms equations. Starting in part
3.1 from variational formulation of initial dynamical problem we construct via
multiresolution analysis (3.2) explicit representation for all dynamical vari-
ables in the base of compactly supported (Daubechies) wavelets. Our solu-
tions (3.3) are parametrized by solutions of a number of reduced algebraical
problems one from which is nonlinear with the same degree of nonlinearity
and the rest are the linear problems which correspond to particular method
of calculation of scalar products of functions from wavelet bases and their
derivatives. Then we consider further extension of our previous results. In
part 4 we consider modiﬁcation of our construction to the periodic case, in
part 5 we consider generalization of our approach to variational formulation
in the biorthogonal bases of compactly supported wavelets and in part 6 to
the case of variable coeﬃcients.
In part 7 we consider results of numerical
calculations.

2 RMS Equations

Below we consider a number of diﬀerent forms of RMS envelope equations,
which are from the formal point of view not more than nonlinear diﬀerential
equations with rational nonlinearities and variable coeﬃcients. Let f (x1, x2)
be the distribution function which gives full information about noninteract-
ing ensemble of beam particles regarding to trace space or transverse phase
coordinates (x1, x2). Then (n,m) moments are:

Z Z xn

1 xm

2 f (x1, x2)dx1dx2

(3)

Figure 1: Wavelets at diﬀerent scales and locations.

The (0,0) moment gives normalization condition on the distribution. The
(1,0) and (0,1) moments vanish when a beam is aligned to its axis. Then we
may extract the ﬁrst nontrivial bit of ‘dynamical information’ from the second
moments

Expressions for twiss parameters are also based on the second moments.

We will consider the following particular cases of rms envelope equations,

which described evolution of the moments (4) ([1]-[3] for full designation):

for asymmetric beams we have the system of two envelope equations of

the second order for σx1 and σx2:

Also we have related Lawson’s equation for evolution of the rms envelope in

where

Kr ≡ −Fr/rβ2γmc2,

β ≡ νb/c =q1 − γ−2

After transformations to Cauchy form we can see that all this equations
from the formal point of view are not more than ordinary diﬀerential equa-
tions with rational nonlinearities and variable coeﬃcients and correspond to
the form (1) (also,we may consider regimes in which γ, γ′ are not ﬁxed func-
tions/constants but satisfy some additional diﬀerential constraint/equation,
but this case does not change our general approach).

3 Rational Dynamics

The ﬁrst main part of our consideration is some variational approach to this
problem, which reduces initial problem to the problem of solution of functional
equations at the ﬁrst stage and some algebraical problems at the second stage.
We have the solution in a compactly supported wavelet basis. Multiresolu-
tion expansion is the second main part of our construction. The solution is
parameterized by solutions of two reduced algebraical problems, one is nonlin-
ear and the second are some linear problems, which are obtained from one of
the next wavelet constructions: the method of Connection Coeﬃcients (CC),
Stationary Subdivision Schemes (SSS).

3.1 Variational Method

Our problems may be formulated as the systems of ordinary diﬀerential equa-
tions

Qi(x)

dxi
dt

= Pi(x, t),

x = (x1, ..., xn),

(10)

i = 1, ..., n, max

i

deg Pi = p, max

i

deg Qi = q

5

with ﬁxed initial conditions xi(0), where Pi, Qi are not more than polynomial
functions of dynamical variables xj and have arbitrary dependence of time.
Because of time dilation we can consider only next time interval: 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.
Let us consider a set of functions

Φi(t) = xi

d
dt

(Qiyi) + Piyi

and a set of functionals

Fi(x) =Z 1

0

Φi(t)dt − Qixiyi |1
0,

(11)

(12)

where yi(t) (yi(0) = 0) are dual (variational) variables. It is obvious that the
initial system and the system

Fi(x) = 0

(13)

are equivalent. Of course, we consider such Qi(x) which do not lead to the
singular problem with Qi(x), when t = 0 or t = 1, i.e. Qi(x(0)), Qi(x(1)) 6= ∞.
In part 5 we consider more general approach, which is based on possibility
taking into account underlying symplectic structure and on more useful and
ﬂexible analytical approach, related to bilinear structure of initial functional.
Now we consider formal expansions for xi, yi:

xi(t) = xi(0) +Xk

λk
i ϕk(t)

yj(t) =Xr

ηr
j ϕr(t),

(14)

where ϕk(t) are useful basis functions of some functional space (L2, Lp, Sobolev,
etc) corresponding to concrete problem and because of initial conditions we
need only ϕk(0) = 0.
λ = {λi} = {λr

i} = (λ1

r = 1, ..., N,

i = 1, ..., n,

i , λ2

i , ..., λN

i ),

(15)

where the lower index i corresponds to expansion of dynamical variable with
index i, i.e. xi and the upper index r corresponds to the numbers of terms
in the expansion of dynamical variables in the formal series. Then we put
(14) into the functional equations (13) and as result we have the following
reduced algebraical system of equations on the set of unknown coeﬃcients λk
i
of expansions (14):

L(Qij, λ, αI ) = M (Pij, λ, βJ ),

(16)

where operators L and M are algebraization of RHS and LHS of initial problem
(10), where λ (15) are unknowns of reduced system of algebraical equations
(RSAE)(16).

6

Qij are coeﬃcients (with possible time dependence) of LHS of initial sys-
tem of diﬀerential equations (10) and as consequence are coeﬃcients of RSAE.
Pij are coeﬃcients (with possible time dependence) of RHS of initial sys-
tem of diﬀerential equations (10) and as consequence are coeﬃcients of RSAE.
I = (i1, ..., iq+2), J = (j1, ..., jp+1) are multiindexes, by which are labelled

αI and βI — other coeﬃcients of RSAE (16):

βJ = {βj1...jp+1} =Z Y1≤jk≤p+1

ϕjk,

where p is the degree of polinomial operator P (10)

αI = {αi1...αiq+2} = Xi1,...,iq+2Z ϕi1... ˙ϕis...ϕiq+2 ,

(17)

(18)

where q is the degree of polynomial operator Q (10), iℓ = (1, ..., q + 2),
dϕis/dt.

˙ϕis =

Now, when we solve RSAE (16) and determine unknown coeﬃcients from
formal expansion (14) we therefore obtain the solution of our initial problem.
It should be noted if we consider only truncated expansion (14) with N terms
then we have from (16) the system of N × n algebraical equations with degree
ℓ = max{p, q} and the degree of this algebraical system coincides with degree
of initial diﬀerential system. So, we have the solution of the initial nonlinear
(rational) problem in the form

xi(t) = xi(0) +

λk
i Xk(t),

NXk=1

(19)

where coeﬃcients λk
i are roots of the corresponding reduced algebraical (poly-
nomial) problem RSAE (16). Consequently, we have a parametrization of so-
lution of initial problem by solution of reduced algebraical problem (16). The
ﬁrst main problem is a problem of computations of coeﬃcients αI (18), βJ
(17) of reduced algebraical system. As we will see, these problems may be
explicitly solved in wavelet approach.

Next we consider the construction of explicit time solution for our problem.
The obtained solutions are given in the form (19), where Xk(t) are basis func-
tions and λi
k are roots of reduced system of equations. In our ﬁrst wavelet
case Xk(t) are obtained via multiresolution expansions and represented by
compactly supported wavelets and λi
k are the roots of corresponding general
polynomial system (16) with coeﬃcients, which are given by CC or SSS con-
structions. According to the variational method to give the reduction from
diﬀerential to algebraical system of equations we need compute the objects
αI and βJ .

3.2 Wavelet Framework

Our constructions are based on multiresolution approach. Because aﬃne
group of translation and dilations is inside the approach, this method re-
sembles the action of a microscope. We have contribution to ﬁnal result from
each scale of resolution from the whole inﬁnite scale of spaces. More exactly,
the closed subspace Vj(j ∈ Z) corresponds to level j of resolution, or to scale
j. We consider a r-regular multiresolution analysis of L2(Rn) (of course, we
may consider any diﬀerent functional space) which is a sequence of increasing
closed subspaces Vj:

(20)

satisfying the following properties:

...V−2 ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ ...
\j∈Z
Vj = 0, [j∈Z
f (x) ∈ Vj <=> f (2x) ∈ Vj+1,
f (x) ∈ V0 <=> f (x − k) ∈ V0,

Vj = L2(Rn),

(21)
There exists a function ϕ ∈ V0 such that {ϕ0,k(x) = ϕ(x − k), k ∈ Zn} forms
a Riesz basis for V0.
The function ϕ is regular and localized: ϕ is C r−1, ϕ(r−1) is almost
everywhere diﬀerentiable and for almost every x ∈ Rn, for every integer α ≤ r
and for all integer p there exists constant Cp such that

,∀k ∈ Zn.

Let ϕ(x) be a scaling function, ψ(x) is a wavelet function and ϕi(x) =

| ∂αϕ(x) |≤ Cp(1 + |x|)−p

(22)

ϕ(x − i). Scaling relations that deﬁne ϕ, ψ are

ϕ(x) =

ψ(x) =

akϕk(2x),

akϕ(2x − k) =

N −1Xk=0
(−1)kak+1ϕ(2x + k).

N −1Xk=0
N −2Xk=−1

(23)

(24)

Let indices ℓ, j represent translation and scaling, respectively and

ϕjl(x) = 2j/2ϕ(2j x − ℓ)

(25)
then the set {ϕj,k}, k ∈ Zn forms a Riesz basis for Vj. The wavelet function ψ
is used to encode the details between two successive levels of approximation.
Let Wj be the orthonormal complement of Vj with respect to Vj+1:

Vj+1 = VjM Wj.

8

(26)

Then just as Vj is spanned by dilation and translations of the scaling function,
so are Wj spanned by translations and dilation of the mother wavelet ψjk(x),
where

All expansions which we used are based on the following properties:

ψjk(x) = 2j/2ψ(2j x − k).

j, k ∈ Z is a Hilbertian basis of L2(R)
{ψjk},
{ϕjk}j≥0,k∈Z is an orthonormal basis forL2(R),
∞Mj=0
L2(R) = V0

Wj,

or
{ϕ0,k, ψj,k}j≥0,k∈Z is an orthonormal basis forL2(R).

(27)

(28)

3.3 Wavelet Computations

Now we give construction for computations of objects (17),(18) in the wavelet
case. We use compactly supported wavelet basis: orthonormal basis for func-
tions in L2(R).

Let be f : R −→ C and the wavelet expansion is

f (x) =Xℓ∈Z

cℓϕℓ(x) +

∞Xj=0Xk∈Z

cjkψjk(x)

(29)

If in formulae (29) cjk = 0 for j ≥ J, then f (x) has an alternative ex-
pansion in terms of dilated scaling functions only f (x) = Pℓ∈Z
cJℓϕJℓ(x). This
is a ﬁnite wavelet expansion, it can be written solely in terms of translated
scaling functions. Also we have the shortest possible support: scaling function
DN (where N is even integer) will have support [0, N − 1] and N/2 vanishing
moments. There exists λ > 0 such that DN has λN continuous derivatives;
for small N, λ ≥ 0.55. To solve our second associated linear problem we need
to evaluate derivatives of f (x) in terms of ϕ(x). Let be ϕn
ℓ = dnϕℓ(x)/dxn.
We consider computation of the wavelet - Galerkin integrals. Let f d(x) be
d-derivative of function f (x), then we have f d(x) = Pℓ clϕd
ℓ (x), and values

ℓ (x) can be expanded in terms of ϕ(x)

λm =

where λm are wavelet-Galerkin integrals. The coeﬃcients λm are 2-term con-
nection coeﬃcients. In general we need to ﬁnd (di ≥ 0)

m (x)dx

(32)

According to CC method [14] we use the next construction. When N in scaling
equation is a ﬁnite even positive integer the function ϕ(x) has compact support
contained in [0, N − 1]. For a ﬁxed triple (d1, d2, d3) only some Λd1d2d3
are
nonzero: 2− N ≤ ℓ ≤ N − 2,
|ℓ− m| ≤ N − 2. There
2− N ≤ m ≤ N − 2,
are M = 3N 2 − 9N + 7 such pairs (ℓ, m). Let Λd1d2d3 be an M-vector, whose
components are numbers Λd1d2d3
. Then we have the ﬁrst reduced algebraical
system : Λ satisfy the system of equations (d = d1 + d2 + d3)

AΛd1d2d3 = 21−dΛd1d2d3,

Aℓ,m;q,r =Xp

apaq−2ℓ+par−2m+p

(33)

By moment equations we have created a system of M + d + 1 equations in M
unknowns. It has rank M and we can obtain unique solution by combination
of LU decomposition and QR algorithm. The second reduced algebraical
system gives us the 2-term connection coeﬃcients:

AΛd1d2 = 21−dΛd1d2,

d = d1 + d2, Aℓ,q =Xp

apaq−2ℓ+p

(34)

For nonquadratic case we have analogously additional linear problems for ob-
jects (31). Solving these linear problems we obtain the coeﬃcients of nonlinear
algebraical system (16) and after that we obtain the coeﬃcients of wavelet ex-
pansion (19). As a result we obtained the explicit time solution of our problem
in the base of compactly supported wavelets. We use for modelling D6, D8,
D10 functions and programs RADAU and DOPRI for testing.

In the following we consider extension of this approach to the case of peri-
odic boundary conditions, the case of presence of arbitrary variable coeﬃcients
and more ﬂexible biorthogonal wavelet approach.

10

4 Variational Wavelet Approach for Peri-
odic Trajectories

We start with extension of our approach to the case of periodic trajectories.
The equations of motion corresponding to our problems may be formulated
as a particular case of the general system of ordinary diﬀerential equations
dxi/dt = fi(xj, t), (i, j = 1, ..., n), 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, where fi are not more than
rational functions of dynamical variables xj and have arbitrary dependence
of time but with periodic boundary conditions. According to our variational
approach we have the solution in the following form

xi(t) = xi(0) +Xk

λk
i ϕk(t),

xi(0) = xi(1),

(35)

where λk
i are again the roots of reduced algebraical systems of equations with
the same degree of nonlinearity and ϕk(t) corresponds to useful type of wavelet
bases (frames).
It should be noted that coeﬃcients of reduced algebraical
system are the solutions of additional linear problem and also depend on
particular type of wavelet construction and type of bases.

This linear problem is our second reduced algebraical problem. We need

to ﬁnd in general situation objects

Λd1d2...dn
ℓ1ℓ2...ℓn

=

∞Z−∞ Y ϕdi

ℓi

(x)dx,

(36)

but now in the case of periodic boundary conditions. Now we consider the
procedure of their calculations in case of periodic boundary conditions in
the base of periodic wavelet functions on the interval [0,1] and corresponding
expansion (35) inside our variational approach. Periodization procedure gives
us

ˆϕj,k(x) ≡ Xℓ∈Z
ˆψj,k(x) = Xℓ∈Z

ϕj,k(x − ℓ)

ψj,k(x − ℓ)

(37)

So, ˆϕ, ˆψ are periodic functions on the interval [0,1]. Because ϕj,k = ϕj,k′ if
k = k′mod(2j), we may consider only 0 ≤ k ≤ 2j and as consequence our
multiresolution has the form [j≥0
k=0 [15].

ˆVj = L2[0, 1] with ˆVj = span{ ˆϕj,k}2j−1

11

Integration by parts and periodicity gives useful relations between objects
(36) in particular quadratic case (d = d1 + d2):

Λd1,d2

k1,k2

, Λ0,d

k1,k2

= Λ0,d

0,k2−k1 ≡ Λd

k2−k1

(38)

So, any 2-tuple can be represent by Λd
problem is reduced to the eigenvalue problem for {Λd
system of 2j homogeneous relations in Λd
if we have dilation equation in the form ϕ(x) = √2Pk∈Z hkϕ(2x − k), then

k. Then our second additional linear
k}0≤k≤2j by creating a
k and inhomogeneous equations. So,

we have the following homogeneous relations

Λd
k = 2d

N −1Xm=0

N −1Xℓ=0

(39)

or in such form Aλd = 2dλd, where λd = {Λd

(41)
So, we reduced our last problem to standard linear algebraical problem. Then
we use the same methods as in part 3.3. As a result we obtained for closed
trajectories of orbital dynamics the explicit time solution (35) in the base of
periodized wavelets (37).

5 Variational Approach in Biorthogonal
Wavelet Bases

Now we consider further generalization of our variational wavelet approach.
Because integrand of variational functionals is represented by bilinear form
(scalar product) it seems more reasonable to consider wavelet constructions
[16] which take into account all advantages of this structure.

The action functional for loops in the phase space is

F (γ) =Zγ

pdq −Z 1

0

12

H(t, γ(t))dt

(42)

The critical points of F are those loops γ, which solve the Hamiltonian equa-
tions associated with the Hamiltonian H and hence are periodic orbits.

Let us consider the loop space Ω = C∞(S1, R2n), where S1 = R/Z, of

smooth loops in R2n. Let us deﬁne a function Φ : Ω → R by setting

Φ(x) =Z 1

0

1
2

< −J ˙x, x > dt −Z 1

0

H(x(t))dt,

x ∈ Ω

(43)

The critical points of Φ are the periodic solutions of ˙x = XH (x). Computing
the derivative at x ∈ Ω in the direction of y ∈ Ω, we ﬁnd

Φ′(x)(y) =

d
dǫ

Φ(x + ǫy)|ǫ=0 =Z 1

0

< −J ˙x − ▽H(x), y > dt

(44)

Consequently, Φ′(x)(y) = 0 for all y ∈ Ω iﬀ the loop x satisﬁes the equation
(45)

− J ˙x(t) − ▽H(x(t)) = 0,

i.e. x(t) is a solution of the Hamiltonian equations, which also satisﬁes x(0) =
x(1), i.e. periodic of period 1.

But now we need to take into account underlying bilinear structure via

wavelets.

We started with two hierarchical sequences of approximations spaces [16]:

. . . V−2 ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V2 . . . ,
and as usually, W0 is complement to V0 in V1, but now not necessarily or-
thogonal complement. New orthogonality conditions have now the following
form:

. . .eV−2 ⊂ eV−1 ⊂ eV0 ⊂ eV1 ⊂ eV2 . . . ,

translates of ψ span W0, translates of ˜ψ span fW0. Biorthogonality condi-

tions are

ψjk(x) ˜ψj ′k′(x)dx = δkk′δjj ′,

(47)

Vj ⊥ fWj,

eVj ⊥ Wj

W0 ⊥ eV0,

< ψjk, ˜ψj ′k′ >=Z ∞

−∞

where ψjk(x) = 2j/2ψ(2j x − k). Functions ϕ(x), ˜ϕ(x − k) form dual pair:
< ϕ(x− k), ˜ϕ(x− ℓ) >= δkl, < ϕ(x− k), ˜ψ(x− ℓ) >= 0
for ∀k, ∀ℓ. (48)
Functions ϕ, ˜ϕ generate a multiresolution analysis. ϕ(x − k), ψ(x − k) are
synthesis functions, ˜ϕ(x − ℓ), ˜ψ(x − ℓ) are analysis functions. Synthesis func-
tions are biorthogonal to analysis functions. Scaling spaces are orthogonal
to dual wavelet spaces. Two multiresolutions are intertwining Vj + Wj =
Vj+1,

eVj +fWj = eVj+1. These are direct sums but not orthogonal sums.

13

So, our representation for solution has now the form

f (t) =Xj,k

˜bjkψjk(t),

(49)

where synthesis wavelets are used to synthesize the function. But ˜bjk come
from inner products with analysis wavelets. Biorthogonality yields

˜bℓm =Z f (t) ˜ψℓm(t)dt.

(50)

So, now we can introduce this more complicated construction into our vari-
ational approach. We have modiﬁcation only on the level of computing co-
eﬃcients of reduced nonlinear algebraical system. This new construction is
more ﬂexible. Biorthogonal point of view is more stable under the action
of large class of operators while orthogonal (one scale for multiresolution) is
fragile, all computations are much more simpler and we accelerate the rate
of convergence. In all types of (Hamiltonian) calculation, which are based on
some bilinear structures (symplectic or Poissonian structures, bilinear form of
integrand in variational integral) this framework leads to greater success.

6 Variable Coeﬃcients

In the case when we have situation when our problem is described by a system
of nonlinear (rational) diﬀerential equations, we need to consider extension
of our previous approach which can take into account any type of variable
coeﬃcients (periodic, regular or singular). We can produce such approach
if we add in our construction additional reﬁnement equation, which encoded
all information about variable coeﬃcients [17]. According to our variational
approach we need to compute integrals of the form

ZD

bij(t)(ϕ1)d1(2mt − k1)(ϕ2)d2(2mt − k2)dx,

(51)

where now bij(t) are arbitrary functions of time, where trial functions ϕ1, ϕ2
satisfy a reﬁnement equations:

ϕi(t) = Xk∈Z

aikϕi(2t − k)

(52)

If we consider all computations in the class of compactly supported wavelets
then only a ﬁnite number of coeﬃcients do not vanish. To approximate the

14

non-constant coeﬃcients, we need choose a diﬀerent reﬁnable function ϕ3
along with some local approximation scheme

(Bℓf )(x) := Xα∈Z

Fℓ,k(f )ϕ3(2ℓt − k),

(53)

where Fℓ,k are suitable functionals supported in a small neighborhood of 2−ℓk
and then replace bij in (51) by Bℓbij(t).
In particular case one can take
a characteristic function and can thus approximate non-smooth coeﬃcients
locally. To guarantee suﬃcient accuracy of the resulting approximation to
(51) it is important to have the ﬂexibility of choosing ϕ3 diﬀerent from ϕ1, ϕ2.
In the case when D is some domain, we can write

bij(t) |D= X0≤k≤2ℓ

bij(t)χD(2ℓt − k),

(54)

where χD is characteristic function of D. So, if we take ϕ4 = χD, which is
again a reﬁnable function, then the problem of computation of (51) is reduced
to the problem of calculation of integral

H(k1, k2, k3, k4) = H(k) =

(55)

ZRs

ϕ4(2jt − k1)ϕ3(2ℓt − k2)ϕd1

1 (2rt − k3)ϕd2

2 (2st − k4)dx

The key point is that these integrals also satisfy some sort of reﬁnement
equation [17]:

2−|µ|H(k) =Xℓ∈Z

b2k−ℓH(ℓ),

µ = d1 + d2.

(56)

This equation can be interpreted as the problem of computing an eigen-
vector. Thus, we reduced the problem of extension of our method to the case
of variable coeﬃcients to the same standard algebraical problem as in the
preceding sections. So, the general scheme is the same one and we have only
one more additional linear algebraic problem by which we in the same way
can parameterize the solutions of corresponding problem.

7 Numerical Calculations

In this part we consider numerical illustrations of previous analytical ap-
proach. Our numerical calculations are based on compactly supported Daubechies
wavelets and related wavelet families.

15

On Fig. 2 we present according to formulae (2) contributions to approxi-
mation of our dynamical evolution (top row on the Fig. 3) starting from the
coarse approximation, corresponding to scale 20 (bottom row) to the ﬁnest
one corresponding to the scales from 21 to 25 or from slow to fast components
(5 frequencies) as details for approximation. Then on Fig. 3, from bottom
to top, we demonstrate the summation of contributions from corresponding
levels of resolution given on Fig. 2 and as result we restore via 5 scales (fre-
quencies) approximation our dynamical process(top row on Fig. 3 ). In this
particular model case we considered for approximation simple two frequencies
harmonic process. But the same situation we have on the Fig. 5 and Fig. 6
in case when we added to previous 2-frequencies harmonic process the noise
as perturbation. Again, our dynamical process under investigation (top row
of Fig. 6) is recovered via 5 scales contributions (Fig. 5) to approximations
(Fig. 6). The same decomposition/approximation we produce also on the level
of power spectral density in the process without noise (Fig. 4) and with noise
(Fig. 7). On Fig. 8 we demonstrate the family of localized contributions to
beam motion, which we also may consider for such type of approximation.

It should be noted that complexity of such algorithms are minimal regard-
ing other possible. Of course, we may use diﬀerent multiresolution analysis
schemes, which are based on diﬀerent families of generating wavelets and apply
such schemes of numerical–analytical calculations to any dynamical process
which may be described by systems of ordinary/partial diﬀerential equations
with rational nonlinearities [13].

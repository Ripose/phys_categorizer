Abstract

A new scheme for the two-dimensional cooling of ion beams in storage rings is
suggested in which ions interact with a counterpropagating broad-band laser beam.
The interaction region in the direction of the ion movement is much less then the
wavelength of the ion betatron oscillations. The laser beam in the orbit plane has
sharp ﬂat edge directed to the ion beam and the width of the laser beam of the order
of the ion beam width. Laser beam radial position is being displaced with some velocity
at ﬁrst from inside and then from outside to the ion beam and decreases both betatron
and synchrotron oscillations.

1 Introduction

A series of the ion cooling methods are suggested to decrease the emittances of charged parti-
cle beams. Among them: synchrotron radiation damping [1], electron cooling [2], stochastic
cooling [3], one dimensional laser cooling [4]. Laser cooling is highly eﬃcient in the longitu-
dinal direction, but diﬃcult in the transverse direction unless a special coupling mechanism
is introduced [5], [6]. In papers [6]-[9] the three-dimensional RIC method is proposed. Nev-
ertheless the quest for new cooling schemes remains vital for the cooling of both not fully
stripped and fully stripped high current proton and more heavy ion beams. In this Letter, a
new scheme for two-dimensional cooling of ion beams in storage rings is suggested in which
photons in a counterpropagating narrow broad-band laser beam interact with ions.

To explain the basic principle of the two-dimensional cooling of ion beams in storage
rings consider the process of change of the amplitude of the betatron oscillations and the
position of the instantaneous ion orbit in the process of the energy loss of the ions. We will
consider the case when the RF accelerating system of the storage ring is switched oﬀ.

Let us the instantaneous orbits of ions are distributed in a region ρ0 ± σρε and the
amplitudes of ion oscillations are distributed in a region σbε relatively to the instantaneous
orbits corresponding to the ion energy ε, where ρ0 is the location of the middle instantaneous
orbit, σρε > 0 mean-root square deviation of the instantaneous orbits from the middle one
which is determined by the initial energy spread σε (see Fig. 1). A broad-band laser beam
LB1 is situated at the orbit region (ρph, ρph − a), where a is the laser beam width. The
upper edge of the laser beam must have the form of the ﬂat boundary and its lower part
must have smooth decay of density or width. In such scheme the laser beam overlap only a
part of the ion beam.

In this scheme the ions with the largest amplitudes of betatron oscillations will interact
with the laser beam ﬁrst. At that the interaction will take place only at the moment when the
ion deviation caused by the betatron oscillations will have approximately the amplitude value
and the deviation will be directed toward the laser beam. Immediately after the interaction
the position of the ion will be the same (inside the laser beam LB1 and near to its edge) but
the instantaneous orbit will be displaced inward in the direction of the laser beam. It means
that after interaction both the position of the instantaneous orbit and the amplitude of the
betatron oscillations will be changed at the same value. After every interaction the position
of the instantaneous orbit will be nearer and nearer to the laser beam and the amplitude
of the betatron oscillations will be smaller and smaller until it will reach zero. At the same
time the instantaneous orbit will reach the edge of the laser beam. Up to that time the
instantaneous orbit will go with some velocity ˙ρ = dρ/dt in the direction of the laser beam
and will not get deeper into the laser beam.

Fig.1: The scheme of the two-dimensional ion cooling. The axis y is the equilibrium
orbit of the storage ring, 1-1, 2-2 ... the location of the instantaneous ion orbit
after 0,1,2 ... events of the ion energy loss,LB1 and LB2 are the laser beams
moving by turns with the velocity v1,2 from outside to the equilibrium orbit.

At the moment when the instantaneous orbit will enter the laser beam the amplitude
of the ion betatron oscillations will be small. After the instantaneous orbit will enter the
laser beam then it will continue its movement but now it will move through the laser beam.
Now the amplitude will be increasing proportionally to the root-mean-square of the number
of the interactions of the ion with the laser beam that is slowly then the decreasing of the

amplitude in the previous case (proportionally to the number of the interactions). This is
because of the ion will interact with the laser beam both with positive and negative deviation
from the instantaneous orbit.

The ion beam has a set of amplitudes of betatron oscillations and instantaneous orbits. To
cool all ions of the beam we must move the laser beam radial position with some velocity v1
in the direction of the ion beam or move the instantaneous orbits by kick, phase displacement
or eddy electric ﬁelds in the direction of the laser beam. This velocity must be much less
then the velocity of the instantaneous orbit ˙ρ. In this case the amplitudes of the betatron
oscillations will be in time to decrease theirs amplitudes to small values before they enter
the laser beam. After all ions of the ion beam will be in the state of interaction with the
laser beam then the laser beam must be stopped. After the stop the ions will continue to
move to the tapered edge of the laser beam with the decreasing velocity and will be gathered
at this edge. The longer we will wait the less the energy spread will be obtained.

As the thickness of the laser beam will be the less the nearer the ion orbit to the remote
edge of the laser beam then the damping time will be too high if we will wait for a small
energy spread of the cooled ion beam. To shorten this damping time we can use the second
laser beam from the opposite side of the ion beam (see Fig.1). At this stage the ion beam
will have small amplitudes of betatron oscillations. The second laser beam radial position
must be moved to the ion beam with the velocity slightly higher then the average velocity
of movement of the instantaneous ion orbit which is determined by the intensity of the laser
beam. In this case the ion orbits will be in time to enter into the laser beam at a distance
higher then the residual amplitude of ion betatron oscillations and hence the amplitude of
betatron oscillations at this stage will be increased slowly with the number of interactions
(according to the root-mean-square law). High energy ions ﬁrst of all and then ions with
smaller energies will interact with the laser beam. This process will last until laser beam
will reach the instantaneous orbit with the least energy and ions of this orbit will be cooled.
Such a way we can repeat the cooling process and to reach the energy spread of the ion beam

where εi = Mc2γ is the ion energy, M ion rest mass, εint the average energy of the ion loss
per one event of interaction, γ the relativistic factor of the ion.

The second laser beam can be monochromatic one with the sweeping frequency and
overlap the ion beam as a whole. In this case the ordinary one-dimensional laser cooling will
take place at the second stage of the laser cooling.

The two-step scheme will work in the case when the RF system of the storage ring is

switched on as well. Some peculiarities will be in this case.

τs is the ion cooling time for the longitudinal (energy - length) space, τb the ion cooling time
for the radial betatron oscillations, f the frequency of the ion beam revolution in the storage
ring, σbε = σbε/αR the energy interval corresponding to one for the instantaneous orbits
distributed through the interval of radii σb, R the average radius of the storage ring, k1, k2
are the ratio of the velocity of movement of the ﬁrst and second laser beam to the average
velocity of movement of the ion instantaneous orbit caused by the interaction of the ions
with the laser beam respectively, α the momentum compaction function.

We now considere two examples of the two-dimensional ion cooling. First the hydrogen-
like P b ion beam in the CERN LHC, for which the relevant parameters are 2πR = 27 km,
γ = 3000, Mc2γ = 575 TeV, Z = 82, σx = 1.2 · 10−3, ∆γ/γ = 2 · 10−4 (σε = 1.15 · 1011
eV). For the bandwidth of the laser beam ∆ωL/ωL = 10−4, the transition between the 1S
ground state and the 2P excited state of a hydrogenlike P b ion, we obtain from the well-
known formulas the value of the resonant transition energy ¯hω∗ = 68.7 keV, the cross section
σ = 6.58 · 10−18 cm2, average energy of the scattered photon < ¯hωs >= εint = 0.2 GeV, and
the required laser wavelength λL = 1080˚A [7]. The laser cross section is larger then that of
the ion beam as long as the Rayleigh length zR = πσ2
x/λL ≥ 0.42 cm. We will choose the
value lL = 2zR = 15 cm for the rms transverse laser beam size at its waist σL = 5.8 · 10−3
cm and the power of the laser beam is PL = 400 W. In this case IL = 4.94 MW/cm2,
¯hωL = 11.49 eV, f = 1.11 · 104 Hz, ∆Nint = 1.68 · 10−2, the damping time τs|k1=10 ≃ 3.06 sec.
The damping time for the betatron oscillations τb|k2=1.1 ≃ 0.28 sec when the value σεb = σε.
The limiting relative energy spread (1) in this case ∆εi/εi ≃ 3.5 · 10−7. A metal screen can
be used to produce the laser beam with sharp edge.

In the second example the ion cooling of fully stripped P b ion beam occurs through the
electron-positron pair production [10], [11]. The parameters of the ion beam and the cross
section of the laser beam are those of the previous example. In this case the threshold energy
of the laser photon beam ¯hωL,thr = 335eV . We choose the photon energy ¯hωL = 670eV and
the power PL = 106 W. In this case IL = 1.23 · 1010 W/cm2, λL = 18.5 ˚A, zR = 57 cm,
lL = 115 cm, σ = 8.1 · 10−24 cm2, εint ≃ 2mc2 ≃ 3.06 GeV [11], ∆Nint = 6.84 · 10−6,
τs|k1=10 = 4.95 · 103 sec ≃ 1.38 h, τb|k2=1.1 = 4.5 · 102 sec. The average power P L = 1 MW
in 1˚A region is not real now. But if all particles of the ion beam will be gathered in one
bunch of the length lion = lL/2 = zR and the laser beam will consist of the wavepackets of
the length lL = 2zR which follow with the frequency f , then the average laser power can be
decreased 2πR/lL = 2.35 · 104 times that is to the value P = 43 W at the same damping time
τs|k1=10 ≃ 1.38 h. The limiting relative energy spread (1) in this case ∆εi/εi ≃ 2.7 · 10−6.

We can get the part of the LHC trajectory with the average value of the β-function
β = 62 m [12] to work with higher dimensions of the ion beam. Such interaction can take
place in the banding magnet of the LHC and the laser beam with sharp edge can fall at
some small angle to the plane of the ion orbit in order to the interaction took place at short
distance lL and the boundary of the laser beam was ﬂat through the interaction region.

The examples show that the suggested version of the two-dimensional cooling is more
eﬃcient then the three-dimensional radiative laser cooling scheme for the case of the res-
onant Rayleigh backscattering scheme [7]. The ion cooling through electron-positron pair
production is possible in principle in this scheme. Some problems can arise for the heavy
ion cooling in the last case because of strong Z-dependence of the probability of the electron
capture by ion from the produced pair [12]. The scheme under consideration based on the
backward Compton scattering can be used in the case of the electron cooling as well.

One of the authors (E.G.) thanks Dr.Karlheinz Schindl who paid attention on strong

Z-dependence of the probability of the electron capture by ion from the produced pair.

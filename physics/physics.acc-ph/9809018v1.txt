In the present paper we study the long wavelength and slow time scale behavior of a coasting
beam in a resonator adopting a broad-band impedance model. Based on the renormalization group
approach we derive a set of coupled evolution equations for the beam envelope distribution function
and the resonator voltage amplitude. The equation for the resonator voltage amplitude is further
transformed into a generalized Ginzburg-Landau equation.

I. INTRODUCTION.

So far nonlinear wave phenomena have received scant attention in the study of collective eﬀects in charged particle
beams. Considerable experimental and simulation data however exists suggesting that these phenomena should be
included into the entire physical picture of beam propagation in accelerators and storage rings.

A vast literature in the ﬁeld of plasma physics is dedicated to the study of nonlinear wave-particle processes due to
space charge interparticle forces. In high energy particle accelerators, where space charge forces are negligibly small,
of particular interest is the coherent state of the beam under the inﬂuence of wakeﬁelds, or in the frequency domain,
machine impedance. This state is highly nonlinear and depends on the interaction of nonlinear waves, involving some
weak dissipative mechanisms that balance beam ﬂuctuations driven be the wakeﬁelds.

In a previous work [1], [2] we studied nonlinear behavior of a coasting beam under the inﬂuence of a resonator
impedance. Starting from the gas-dynamic equations for longitudinal motion and using a renormalization group (RG)
approach [3], [4] we found a set of coupled nonlinear equations for the beam density and resonator voltage. However,
as is well-known, the hydrodynamic approximation is valid when the beam is close to a local equilibrium, which in a
number of practically important cases may well be far from reality.

The present paper, providing a complete kinetic description of the processes involved, is aimed to overcome the
above mentioned diﬃculties. In what follows we study the longitudinal dynamics of a coasting beam in a resonator
adopting a broad-band impedance model. We are interested in describing slow motion of beam patterns (droplets)
neglecting fast oscillations of beam density and voltage on the resonator at a frequency close to the resonant frequency.
We employ the RG method to derive amplitude equations governing the dynamics of slow processes. In Section II we
obtain the desired equations for the longitudinal envelope distribution function and the amplitude of the resonator
voltage. In Section III we proceed to transform the equation for the voltage amplitude into a generalized Ginzburg-
Landau equation by solving explicitly the Vlasov equation for the envelope distribution function. Finally in Section
IV we draw some conclusions resulting from the work performed.

The starting point for the subsequent analysis is the system of equations:

equations (1) have been rescaled as well from their actual values Va, Ia and fa as follows:

In the deﬁnition (6) ξ can be viewed as a Lagrange variable which is usually determined from the condition that the
distribution function f (θ, v; T ) be equal to a speciﬁed distribution, say the equilibrium distribution for instance:

Substitution of eq. (6), into the system (1) yields:

f (θ, v; T ) = f0 (ξ)

v = U (θ, ξ; T ) .

where the fact that the azimuth θ is a slow variable (the dependence of F, U and V on θ is through a stretched
variable ζ = εθ) has been taken into account. Note that the system (7) resembles the set of gas-dynamic equations,
governing the longitudinal motion of the beam. It bears however, additional information about the velocity distribu-
tion, embedded in the dependence on the Lagrange variable ξ, and takes into account its overall eﬀect through the
integral on the right hand side of the third equation.

We next examine the solution of the system of equations (7) order by order in the formal small parameter ε by

carrying out a naive perturbation expansion. The zero order solution (stationary solution) is readily found to be:

and in particular one can choose

Combining the ﬁrst order equations

The system of equations (16) and (17) provides a complete description of nonlinear particle-wave interaction. It
governs slow processes of beam pattern dynamics through the evolution of the amplitude functions. In (16) one can
immediately recognize the Vlasov equation for the envelope distribution function G (θ, v; T ) with the ponderomotive
force, due to fast oscillations at frequency close to the resonant frequency. It may be worth noting that the system
(16) and (17) intrinsically contains the nonlinear Landau damping mechanism, a fact that will become apparent from
the treatment in the next Section.

The generalized Ginzburg-Landau equation (27) is known [7] to provide the basic framework for the study of
many properties of non equilibrium systems, such as existence and interaction of coherent structures, generic onset of
travelling wave disturbance in continuous media, appearance of chaos. Recent experimental and numerical evidence
(see e.g. [1], [2] and the references therein) shows that similar behavior is consistent with the propagation of charged
particle beams, and the generalized Ginzburg-Landau equation we have derived could represent the appropriate
analytical model to study the above mentioned phenomena.

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS.

As a result of the investigation performed we have shown that a coasting beam under the inﬂuence of a resonator
impedance exhibits spatial-temporal patterns modulated by an envelope (amplitude) function, which varies slowly
compared to the fast time and short wavelength scales of the pattern itself. Extracting long wavelength and slow time
scale behavior of the system we have derived a set of coupled nonlinear evolution equations for the beam envelope
distribution function and voltage amplitude. We have further shown that the amplitude of the nonlinear wave satisﬁes
a generalized Ginzburg-Landau equation.

It is worthwhile to mention that the analytical framework presented here bears rather general features. It pro-
vides complete kinetic description of slow, fully nonlinear particle-wave interaction process, and allows higher order
corrections to the generalized Ginzburg-Landau equation to be taken into account.

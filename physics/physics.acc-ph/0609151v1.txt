ABSTRACT

Features of forward diﬀracted Parametric X-Radiation (PXR) were investigated at experiments with the 855
MeV electron beam of the Mainz Microtron MAMI employing a 410 µm thick tungsten single crystal. Virtual
photons from the electron ﬁeld are diﬀracted by the (10¯1) plane at a Bragg angle of 3.977◦. Forward emitted
radiation was analyzed at an energy of 40 keV with the (111) lattice planes of a ﬂat silicon single crystal in Bragg
geometry. Clear peak structures were observed in an angular scan of the tungsten single crystal. The results
were analyzed with a model which describes forward diﬀracted PXR under real experimental conditions. The
experiments show that forward diﬀracted PXR may be employed to diagnose bending radii of lattice planes in
large area single crystals.

1. INTRODUCTION

If a charged particle passes an interface between two amorphous media with diﬀerent dielectric susceptibilities
broad band electromagnetic radiation is produced. The frequency spectrum of this so-called transition radiation
In the ultra relativistic case the
(TR) has been calculated by Ginsburg and Frank [1] and Garibian [2, 3].
radiation distribution resembles a Lorentz transformed dipole pattern with maximum intensity at an angle 1/γ
β2 the relativistic factor, β = v/c, v the electron velocity, and c the speed of light. The energy
with γ = 1/
spectrum extends up to a gradual cut-oﬀ energy γ¯hωp with ωp the plasma frequency. For an electron energy of
855 MeV, as available at the Mainz Microtron MAMI, the characteristic opening angle at γ = 1673 amounts to
0.6 mrad. The cut oﬀ energy for tungsten with ¯hωp = 80.4 eV is as high as 135 keV.

When a relativistic electron crosses the boundary between vacuum and a single crystal the TR propagates
into the crystal in forward direction. A diﬀracted transition radiation (DTR) reﬂex with a wave vector kr is
created if the wave vector kv associated with the virtual photon ﬁeld of the electron fulﬁls approximately the well
known Bragg law in vector form kv + H
kr, with H a reciprocal lattice vector of a speciﬁc crystal plane, see
e.g. [4]. Inside the crystal the TR ﬁeld will be extinguished by Bragg scattering, photo absorption or Compton
scattering. After a suﬃciently long distance from the entrance interface its amplitude may become negligibly
small. Finally, deep inside the crystal, only the virtual photon ﬁeld associated with the electron remains. But
also under these circumstances monochromatic X rays are emitted close to the Bragg direction. This kind
of radiation was predicted in the framework of a kinematical theory by Ter-Mikaelian [5] in which only one
diﬀracted wave is required. Baryshevsky and Feranchuk [6, 7], and Garibian and Yang [8, 9] explained this so-
called parametric X-ray radiation (PXR) with dynamical theories in which an additional forward diﬀracted wave
occurs. According to theoretical predictions PXR is quasi-monochromatic and features at a ﬁxed observation
angle narrow energy band characteristics. It was suggested that PXR is just a kind of ˇCerenkov radiation, see
Ref. [10] and citations therein. Later on, kinematical theories were developed by Nitta [11, 12], Achim Richters

group [13], and dynamical ones by Caticha [4, 14] and Artru et al. [15]. Experimentally PXR was studied in a
number of papers, see e.g. for an overview up to the year 1997 Ref. [16] and references cited therein, as well as
Ref. [17–20].

It is very diﬃcult to decide experimentally whether PXR emission is a kinematical or dynamical process.
The reason has been discussed by Nitta [21]. He showed that the ﬁrst-order approximation of the dynamical
calculation gives the kinematical expression. Extremely accurate absolute intensity measurements would be
required to detect a diﬀerence. Baryshevsky [22] proposed to search for the predicted forward diﬀracted wave
which is associated to PXR and emitted close to the direction the electron travels. Similar proposals have also
been communicated by Nasonov [23,24]. A number of unsuccessful experiments were performed for the search of
such a forward diﬀracted parametric X radiation (FDPXR) [25–28]. First observations of interference phenomena
in the TR emission spectrum close to a Bragg energy from thin silicon single crystal targets were reported by
the Mainz group [29]. Later on, the forward diﬀracted PXR peaks were observed by the Tomsk-Belgorod [30]
and the Mainz [31] groups.

In this contribution we describe results obtained with a 410 µm thick tungsten single crystal at the Mainz
Microtron MAMI. This crystal, cut with the [111] direction perpendicular to the surface, was also used for
experiments of Ref. [30]. In the experiments described in this contribution special emphasis was put on a more
quantitative understanding of the forward diﬀracted PXR peak for which also the inﬂuence of the analyzing
crystal spectrometer device on the signal generation had to be studied carefully.

2.1. Parametric X Radiation as a Dynamical Process

2. BASICS

Let us consider the radiation ﬁelds of a highly relativistic electron in a semi-inﬁnite crystal. The electron is
assumed to move on a straight trajectory with constant relativistic factor γ. If the electron crosses the boundary
between vacuum and crystal transition radiation (TR) and transition diﬀracted radiation (TDR) is created, see
e.g. [4]. The TR ﬁeld propagates in the crystal in forward direction, the TDR ﬁeld is assumed to be associated
with a Laue reﬂection characterized by a reciprocal lattice vector H. Both ﬁelds will be attenuated in the crystal
by photo absorption or Compton scattering and after a suﬃcient long distance from the entrance interface their
amplitudes may become negligibly small. Finally, only the virtual photon ﬁeld Ac associated to the electron
remains. We are interested in the interaction of this ﬁeld with the crystal which can best be discussed in the
framework of dispersion surfaces. Following the work of Caticha [4] in Fig. 1 dispersion surfaces of the electron
ﬁeld (DSEF) and of X-rays in the crystal (DSXC) are shown. In this picture a virtual photon is characterized
by a wave vector kv, starting at a point V of the DSEF and pointing to the origin O, and the ﬁeld amplitude
Ac0. A particular situation happens if the point V approaches the intersection C between the DSEF and the
DSXCH with its origin at the point H. In the surrounding of this intersection point C the virtual photon ﬁeld
of the electron is diﬀracted. The momentum transfer ¯hH transforms kv into kH = kv + H and a real photon in
the crystal with a ﬁeld amplitude AcH is created. This is the well known PXR ﬁeld. The corresponding forward
diﬀracted ﬁeld Ac0, however, remains a virtual one. A momentum transfer ∆pc = (¯hK/2)(1/γ2 + ϑ2

would be required to shift it on the DSXC0 which has its origin at point O. In this equation K =
= ω/c
|
is the vacuum wave vector of the radiation ﬁeld, −→ϑv the angle between v and kv, and χ0 = χ′
0 + iχ′′
0 the mean
dielectric susceptibility of the crystal. The fact that only one real ﬁeld amplitude AcH exists in the crystal at the
intersection C between DSEF and DSXCH resembles a kinematical picture of PXR generation. But in reality the
virtual ﬁeld of the electron is diﬀracted into two ﬁeld amplitudes Ac0 and AcH from which the former remains a
virtual ﬁeld. It must be concluded that in the framework of this picture PXR production is a dynamical process.

It remains to be discussed how the existence of the forward diﬀracted virtual ﬁeld Ac0 at the intersection C
can be established experimentally. Of course, as a virtual ﬁeld it can not be observed directly. However, let us
assume that the electron exits the crystal at a second boundary again into vacuum. The continuity of the vector
Av with Av the virtual
potential at this surface requires an additional radiation ﬁeld in vacuum Ar = Ac0 −
ﬁeld amplitude of the moving electron in vacuum. At a point V far oﬀ the intersection point C the emitted
radiation is just again the well known TR. However, close to the intersection C the additional forward diﬀracted
ﬁeld amplitude will contribute in addition. The free X-ray ﬁeld Ar can be observed with an angular and energy

resolving radiation detector system. It is expected that the amplitude Ac0 and therefore also the radiation ﬁeld
Ar exhibits a resonance behavior at well deﬁned correlated photon emission angles −→ϑ and photon energies ¯hω
which we call in the following forward diﬀracted parametric X radiation (FDPXR). As will be discussed elsewhere
in more detail, FDPXR can either be observed as an ”amplitude contrast” from a thick (semi-inﬁnite) crystal or
as a ”phase contrast” from a thin crystal slab. In the former only the amplitude from the exit interface remains,
while in the latter the radiation amplitude created at the entrance interface survives and interferes coherently
with the amplitude created at the exit interface. Both experiments have been performed at the Mainz Microtron
MAMI [31].

2.2. Theoretical Background

are the vacuum formation length and the mean formation length in the crystal, respectively. Notice that the
latter is just the formation length for amorphous matter. The quantity ε = (¯hω
¯hω0)/¯hω0 is the relative
energy deviation from the reference energy ¯hω0 = ¯hcH0/(2 sin Θ0) with H0 = 2π√h2 + k2 + l2/a0, h, k, l the
Miller indices, and a0 the lattice constant. The quantities ε0, ε1, γ0, and γ1 are functions of various geometrical
variables as the observation angle ~ϑ, the deviation ~ϕ of an individual electron from the nominal direction which
coincides with the z axis, the rotation angle ψ around the vertical y axis which describes a small deviation of
the reciprocal lattice vector H from the nominal orientation H0 in the (x, z) plane, and the Fourier components
χ0 and χH of the dielectric susceptibility of the crystal, see Ref. [33]. For our experimental conditions these

Moreover, the factor P is 1 or cos(2Θ0) for σ or π polarization, respectively, ˆeP the desired polarization state,
K0 = ω0/c, and e the charge of the electron. Finally, the polarization factor ˆvˆeP must be calculated. We
distinguish between π polarization for which the polarization vector ˆeπ lies in the plane spanned by the vector kv
and H, and σ polarization for which ˆeσ is perpendicular to this plane. Notice, that in both cases the polarization
vector ˆeP is perpendicular to the unit wave vector kv of the virtual photon. The result is

PXR and FDPXR amplitudes are intimately connected with each other. Both amplitudes have the same struc-
ture, in particular their poles are identical, and both amplitudes disappear for amorphous matter, i.e. for χH =
0. In this case the parameters ε1 and γ1 are zero, and the forward amplitude, Eq. (1), reduces to the expression
for transition radiation from a single interface of amorphous matter. The same is true far oﬀ the resonance where
the PXR and FDPXR amplitudes are negligibly small.

Figure 2. Calculated forward diﬀracted intensity distributions for the target in positive orientation, see Fig. 3 (a) for
explanation. Panel (a) shows calculations with Eq. (11) in a logarithmic scale. A resonance is seen as function of the
relative photon energy ε = ∆¯hω/¯hω0 for observation in beam direction ϑx = ϑy = 0 mrad, rotation angle ψ = 0 mrad.
Panel (b) shows the resonance as function of the observation angle ϑx (ϑy = 0 mrad) for ε = 0, electron beam direction
ϕx = 1.0 mrad, ϕy = 0 mrad, and rotation angle ψ = 0 mrad. The tungsten radiator single crystal is assumed to be
cut with the (111) plane parallel to the surface. Reciprocal lattice vector ˆH0= (0.997592, 0, -0.0693592), and surface

The intensity distribution of the forward emitted radiation for a single interface is depicted in Fig. 2. Panel (a)
resembles the cross-section of resonance s-wave neutron scattering oﬀ heavy nuclei. Similar as in the latter, the
Za and the additional FDPXR resonance term interfere destructively
smooth part of the formation length Zv −
at the low energy side of the resonance and constructively at the high energy side. The resulting structure has
a very narrow width, in the order of 8 meV only. However, any angular distribution of the electrons at the exit
of the crystal in the angle ~ϕ may deteriorate the line width. Assuming a Gaussian with an rms value σ = 5.32
mrad, which is expected from multiple scattering of the electrons in a tungsten crystal with a thickness of 410

In this approximation the double integral over ϕx and ϕy has been replaced by a single integral. The approxi-
mation is supposed to be suﬃciently accurate as long as the observation angle ~ϑ is very small in comparison to
σ. For −→ϑ = 0 the angles ϕx and ϕy enter in Eq. (11) symmetrically in second order as ϕ2
y = ϕ2 with the
exception of a pre-factor ϕ2
y for π and σ polarization, respectively, originating from Eq. (9). With the
substitution ϕx = ϕ cos α the integration can be carried out in polar coordinates. The integral over α results in
a common factor π which cancels in Eq. (12) and (13) with a factor π in the de-nominator originating from the

normalization of the two-dimensional Gaussian. The result is shown in Fig. 2 (c) in a linear scale. The line is
10−4 with respect to the photon energy but has rather long tails. The reason
still as narrow as about 8 eV or 2
·
of this quite unexpected result can again be found in the already mentioned fact that the quantities (ϑx −
ϕx)
ϕy) enter in Eq. (11) in second order, see Eqns. (5), (6), (7), (8), and 9. Panels (b) and (d) show
and (ϑy −
corresponding results of the intensity distribution at a ﬁxed photon energy. It is noteworthy that even with the
scattering distribution with an angular rms value of 5.32 mrad the angular width ϑx of the resonance amounts
to only 14 µrad.

The detection of such narrow structures is diﬃcult. While the regular PXR peak is background free and can
be observed with detectors of moderate energy resolution, the FDPXR structure is always located on top of the
smooth transition radiation background. This TR background can clearly be seen in Fig. 2 (a) and (b). To
ﬁnd the narrow structures experimentally this background must be suppressed which requires for the detector
a comparably very good energy resolution. As will be described in the next subsection, a silicon single crystal
monochromator is well suited for this purpose.

2.3. Principle of the Experiment

The signal generation will be explained by means of Fig. 3. The reciprocal lattice vector H0 of the radiator
crystal as well as of the analyzer crystal are located in the horizontal (x, z) plane. The two possibilities to place
vector H0 in the (x, z) plane, which are shown in Figs. 3 (a) and (d), correspond to quite diﬀerent features of
the FDPXR signals. The energy of the quasi-monochromatic FDPXR line as function of the emission angle ϑx is
shown in panels (b) and (e) for three diﬀerent rotation angles ψ of the target crystal around the vertical y axis,
which are deviations from the nominal value Ψ = Θ0. The middle line for ψ = 0 corresponds to the nominal
Θ0 to which a positive or a negative sign is assigned, depending on the orientation of the H0
Bragg angle Ψ =
vector. Notice, that for the positive orientation of the target crystal the FDPXR energy increases as function
of the emission angle while for the negative orientation the energy decreases. This feature has the consequence
that the energy characteristics of the ﬂat analyzer crystal, which is assigned in Fig. 3 with Si, intersects the
FDPXR line at quite diﬀerent angles resulting in diﬀerent intensities of the Bragg reﬂex for FDPXR. The energy
has been calculated with the general relation

, and ∆ΘA = 0. In the following it is assumed that for ψ = 0
For a ﬂat crystal the bending radius is R0 → ∞
also ϑx = 0 and the reﬂex enters the detector slit at the position x′ = 0. If now the rotation angle ψ is changed
also ϑx must be varied in order that FDPXR and Si analyzer energies match again. As a consequence, the reﬂex
appears at a diﬀerent position x′ at the detector plane. Again, the displacements are diﬀerent for the positive
and the negative orientation of the W target crystal as shown in panels (c) and (f).

The integral must be taken over the angular region in ϑx which the detector accepts. Limitations originate from
the ﬁnite analyzer crystal length and the slit aperture in front of the detector.

The expected signals, as calculated with Eq. (19), are shown in Fig. 4. The smooth background originates

from the transition radiation contribution.

3.1. Experimental Setup

3. EXPERIMENTAL

The basic idea of our experiment was already explained in subsection 2.3. The details of the setup will be
described in the following with the help of Fig. 5. The target tungsten single crystal, cut with the (111) plane
parallel to the crystal surface, must be positioned in such a manner that the reciprocal lattice vector H0 of
the (10¯1) crystal plane is located in the plane of drawing. At a Bragg angle Θ0 = 3.977◦ the photon energy
amounts to ¯hω0 = 40.0 keV for both, PXR emitted at twice the Bragg angle and FDPXR emitted close to the
10−4 and at the same time a good
electron beam direction. The required energy resolution in the order of 1
angular resolution is achieved by a ﬂat silicon single crystal in Bragg geometry. The monochromator crystal
was cut with the (111) plane parallel to the crystal surface and was used to analyze the FDPXR with its (111)

Figure 5. Experimental setup at the Mainz Microtron MAMI. The ﬂat rectangular silicon single crystal monochromator
of 150 mm length, 40 mm height and 1 mm thickness, cut with the (111) plane parallel to the surface, was positioned in
Bragg geometry at a distance of 7.629 m downstream the tungsten target crystal of d0 = 410 µm thickness, and 8.5 mm
diameter. Reﬂected radiation is detected with a Ge(i) detector with 6.18 mm diameter and 5 mm thickness positioned
in a distance b = 8.436 m from the analyzer crystal. The slit aperture had a width of 3.5 mm in horizontal direction.
The lead shielding of the Ge(i) detector had a thickness of 50 mm. The puriﬁer magnet with a gap width of 60 mm and

distances of 7629 mm and 8436 mm, the angular interval accepted by such a slit aperture is ∆Θx = 0.22 mrad
which is somewhat larger as the calculated FDPXR width of 14 µrad. However, it should be mentioned that the
energy-angle correlations of both, FDPXR and analyzer crystal, deﬁnes also the accepted angular band. The
FDPXR resonance is sought by a variation of the rotation angle ψ of the tungsten crystal around the vertical y
axis. As photon detector a Ge(i) detector with a resolution of 630 eV at 40 keV was used.

3.2. Measurements and Results

10−9 m
rad and 0.5
·

The experiments were performed at an electron beam energy of 855 MeV delivered by the Mainz Microtron
MAMI. The beam current was about 2 nA. The beam spot size amounted to 48 µm (rms) horizontally and
10−9 m
55 µm (rms) vertically. At a beam emittance of 7
rad the angular divergence
·
of the electron beam was 146 µrad (rms) and 9 µrad (rms) in horizontal and vertical direction, respectively.
These numbers are small in comparison to the opening angle of the TR cone which is in the order of 1/γ =
0.6 mrad. The [111] direction of the tungsten target crystal was aligned into the beam direction by means of a
goniometric stage with angular resolution of (2/1, 000)◦. A signal which is sensitive to channeling was derived
from an ionization chamber located 400 mm behind the analyzer crystal. After the [111] direction of the crystal
was found, the reciprocal lattice vector H for one of the three (10¯1) crystal planes had to be placed into the
horizontal (xz) plane. This was achieved by observation of the ordinary PXR with the aid of CdZnTe detector,
see Fig. 5. The target crystal was rotated around the vertical y axis by an angle Ψ = (33.75/2)◦ in order to
fulﬁll the Bragg condition. The PXR photon energy at this angle is 9.6 keV. At a rotation around the [111]
crystal axis from 0-360◦ six PXR reﬂexes of equal intensity are expected which are separated by 60◦ from each
other. However, we observed rather irregular intensities of these reﬂexes. The reason was found in the fact that
the surface normal of the crystal ˆn0 and the reciprocal lattice vector ˆH0 for the [111] direction obviously do
not coincide. Since the goniometric stage rotates the crystal around the ˆn0 axis, the Bragg angle varies at the
rotation, i.e. the angle between beam direction and the various ˆH0 vectors of the (10¯1) family. The experimental
intensities could be explained with the assumption that rotation axis of the goniometer and [111] direction of

14.78◦, 16.46◦, and 17.47◦. Only two values are close to the nominal Bragg angle of 16.88◦ in accord with the
experimental observation that only two strong lines and four rather weak ones were observed. The settings of
the goniometer found for the strongest reﬂection was chosen.

A very simple check that the right (101) lattice planes were found can be performed by a small displacement
of the detector in x′ direction, re-adjustment of the analyzer Bragg angle by the corresponding angle ∆ΘA and
a measurement of the angle ψ at which the FDPXR peak reappears again. From Eqns. (5) and (14) it follows
that the ratio of these angles is ψ/∆ΘA
1.405 with the plus sign for the positive and
the minus sign for the negative orientation. Experimentally we found ψ/∆ΘA
0.14 mrad/mrad and

4. DISCUSSION

The striking result of the experiment described in section 3 is the fact that for the negative orientation a clear
peak with a peak-to-background ratio of 1:1 was observed, while for the positive orientation the peak is rather
weak. This experimental ﬁnding is just the opposite of what was expected, see Fig. 4. A possible experimental
mistake in the assignment of positive and negative orientation of the tungsten crystal was carefully checked and
could safely be excluded as an explanation. Also the signs in the FDPXR formulas underlying the calculations

were checked and a mistake could not be found. The only reasonable explanation for the reversed intensities
was found in a residual bending of the ”plane” silicon analyzer crystal. Assuming a cylindrical shape of the
analyzing crystal with a bending radius R0, the energy characteristics of the analyzer crystal changes its slope as
function of R0. As shown in Fig. 7 a reversed situation in comparison to Figs. 3 can be achieved with a concave
cylindrical shape of the analyzing crystal and a bending radius R0 = 110 m. The corresponding calculated scans
are shown in Fig. 6 (c) and (d). The line widthes are narrower and more intense. However, this fact must not be
overrated since a number of line broadening eﬀects have been disregarded as, e.g., the beam spot size, tungsten-
and analyzer-crystal irregularities, etc. In addition, also the width of the aperture in front of the Ge(i) detector
has an uncertainty which originates from misalignments of a 50 mm long lead aperture with a bore of 8 mm
diameter by an angle of about 4◦.

This possible explanation prompted us to carry out experiments with a silicon single crystal with a length of
100 mm, a height of 50 mm and a thickness of 10 mm which was assumed to be really plane. The experimental
setup was a little modiﬁed. The distances between W target-analyzer-detector were symmetrized and selected as
a = b = 7.629 m. A vertical slit aperture of 0.2 mm width was positioned just in front of the Si analyzer crystal.
This aperture could horizontally be moved during the course of the experiment enabling us to investigate a
possible local bending radius change over the crystal. In addition, the slit aperture in front of the Ge(i) detector
was reduced to a width of 1 mm and the detector assembly was made moveable in x′ direction. With this
setup we found a quite strange behavior which we interpreted as rapidly changing wavy structures of the (111)
lattice planes across the length of the Si crystal resembling somehow a mosaic structure. As a result, further

Figure 8. FDPXR characteristics as function of the bending radius of the Si-monochromator crystal. Experimental
Ψ scans are shown in panels (a), (b), (c), bremsstrahlung background was subtracted, calculated ones in (d), (e), (f).
Target-monochromator-detector distances were a = b = 7.629 m, for deﬁnitions see Fig. 5. Panel (a) shows a measurement
without any tension exerted on the Si-monochromator crystal, panel (b) for a bending that the target radiation was focused
as good as possible onto the 1 mm wide slit aperture in front of the Ge(i) detector, and (c) with still increased tension.
Panel (d) depicts a calculations with a bending of the Si- monochromator crystal of R0 = 105 m, panel (e) with R0 =
150 m, panel (f) with R0 = -300 m, i.e the crystal has a convex shape.

experiments with this ”plane” crystal were abandoned.

Finally, we performed experiments with a third crystal again with a length of 150 mm, a height 40 mm and a
thickness of 1 mm. The crystal was clamped on one of the shorter edges and could be distorted with a moveable
pin which touched the crystal at the opposite side. This way the bending radius could be changed, though
not homogeneously over the whole crystal since the crystal had not a triangular shape. All other experimental
conditions were chosen as described above. In a ﬁrst step of the experiment a scan was taken of the relaxed
crystal. The result is shown in Fig. 8 (a). The corresponding calculation of Fig. 8 (d) indicates that also this
crystal has a residual concave bending with a radius R0 = 105 m. In a second step of the experiment the focus
was searched for by changing systematically the bending radius and observing the TR intensity as function of
the detector position x′. After the maximum was found a Ψ scan of the W-target crystal in positive orientation
was carried out. The result is shown in Fig. 8 (b). The width of the FDPXR structure of 0.96 mrad matches
well with the projection of the Si-analyzer crystal length lc = 150 mm on the x axis. The corresponding accepted
angle is lc sin ΘA
0 /a = 0.97 mrad. (Notice, that in Eq. (5) which describes the energy of the FDPXR peak
ϑx and -ψ appear symmetrically.) Most remarkable is the double peak structure. Two additional scans of the
aperture in front of the Si crystal for ﬁxed Ψ values, chosen in the maxima of both peaks, revealed that they are
correlated to two distinct ϑx regions, each of about 0.13 mrad width and separated by 0.39 mrad. This ﬁnding
suggests that the 1 mm aperture in front of the detector was not wide enough to accept all rays reﬂected by the
Si analyzer crystal. Obviously rays from certain ϑx regions are excluded from detection by the aperture. This
conjecture was corroborated with calculations on the basis of our FDPXR model.

In the model calculations we adjusted the reciprocal lattice vector and the surface normal to ˆH0= (0.997588,

12

-0.00872654, -0.0688609) and ˆn0= (0.0685897, -0.0400394, 0.996841), respectively, in order to take into account
the experimental shift of the FDPXR peak from 3.977◦ to Ψ = 3.95◦. The results of the calculations are shown
in Fig. 8 (d), (e), and (f). In panel (e), for which a bending radius R0 = 150 m was assumed, all of the radiation
impinging on the Si crystal is focused into the 1 mm slit aperture and the FDPXR structure turns out to be
rather ﬂat. However, if an additional deformation is superimposed on the circular bending of the crystal, e.g.
a sinusoidal shape with a period of the crystal length of 150 mm and an amplitude of only 1 µm, a dip in the
middle can be produced which resembles the dip in the measurement shown in panel (b).

A peculiar situation occurs if the bending radius of the Si analyzer crystal is chosen such that the slope
of FDPXR and the analyzer energy characteristics are just the same, see Figs. 3 and 7 for illustration. This
happens for bending radii R0 = 535.52 m and 90.17 m for the positive and negative orientation of the W single
crystal, respectively. For these magic radii the complete FDPXR spectrum will be focused on a single spot which
is located for our symmetrical geometry according to the image equation 1/a + 1/zi = 1/f , with the focal length
f = (R0/2) sin ΘA
0 , at distances of z1 = -18.01 m and z2 = 3.15 m from the Si analyzer crystal, i.e. the former
is a virtual the latter a real focus. If the above condition is fulﬁlled the intensity originating from normal TR
will be enhanced by the FDPXR contribution within an angular tuning range of the target crystal in the order
of ∆Ψ = 10 µrad, see Fig. 2, which now must be convoluted with the reﬂecting power ratio of the analyzer
2, Eq. (16). Since the analyzer crystal has never the ideal structure as mathematically assumed,
crystal
on this basis a method could be developed to diagnose the surface bending radii of large area single crystals.
In order to get familiar with the properties of the FDPXR radiation which is diﬀracted by the Si analyzer
crystal we decreased the bending radius. An example is shown in Fig. 8 (c). As shown in panel (f) of this
Figure 8 the experimental result is in accord with the assumption of a bending radius of minus 300 m, i.e. the
crystal was bent from the concave into a convex shape. Alternatively, it could also be that a piece of the crystal
acted as monochromator which had intrinsically a concave shape. Unfortunately, the beam-time allocated for
the experiment was exhausted after this scan was taken and a search for the magic bending radii could not be
carried out anymore.

5. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

Clear forward diﬀracted PXR structures have been observed for a 410 µm thick tungsten single crystal which was
irradiated with the 855 MeV electron beam of the Mainz Microtron MAMI. For design and interpretation of the
experiments the results of a dynamical formalism developed in Mainz, which predicts FDPXR from a semi-inﬁnite
crystal quite accurately and from crystal slabs approximately, were of crucial importance. From a comparison
of the model predictions and the experimental results it can safely be concluded that PXR production is a
dynamical rather than a kinematical process. The experimental procedure may be developed further to diagnose
local crystal bending radii as large as 1 km of large area crystals.

An interesting question is whether TR from the entrance interface of the crystal may penetrate the 410 µm
thick crystal. The absorption length at a photon energy of 40 keV for amorphous tungsten amounts to 53.4 µm [33]
10−4 of the radiation should transmit the crystal. However, the transmission may be
and only a fraction of 4.6
much larger in a single crystal close to a resonance where the absorption length may be anomalously large [36].
In a next step, the (333) reﬂection of tungsten will be analyzed, which has been measured simultaneously with
the (333) reﬂection of the Si-analyzer crystal. At a photon energy of 120 keV the absorption length amounts
to 204.3 µm [33] and a large fraction of 13.4 % of TR from the entrance interface transmits the crystal which
superimposes with TR and FDPXR produced at the exit interface.

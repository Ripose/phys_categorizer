Abstract

Nonlinear waves have been observed in synchrotrons for
years but have received little attention in the literature.
While pathological, these phenomena are worth studying
on at least two accounts. First, the formation of solitary
waves may lead to droplet formation that causes signiﬁcant
beam halo to develop.
It is important to understand the
conditions under which such behavior may be expected in
terms of the machine impedance. Secondly, a variety of
nonlinear processes are likely involved in the normal sat-
uration of unstable oscillations, leading to the possibility
that low-level, but potentially broadband ﬂuctuation spec-
tra may develop. The resulting ﬂuctuation spectra carry
indirectly the signature of the machine impedance. In this
work we review a number of observations of nonlinear lon-
gitudinal waves made in Fermilab accelerators, and make
a ﬁrst attempt to develop appropriate theoretical models to
explain these observations.

INTRODUCTION

Over the years, nonlinear wave phenomena have received
scant attention in high energy synchrotrons, in part, be-
cause of the mathematical difﬁculty of this subject, but also
due to the fact that nonlinear wave motion is usually asso-
ciated with a pathological state of an accelerator that is best
to be avoided. While this is indeed true for the most violent
nonlinear effects, a broad class of low-level processes may
be playing a role in many present machines, and the drive
for ever higher beam intensities may lead to the widespread
occurrence of nonlinear wave phenomena.

In particular, in the case of the dynamical behavior in
the vicinity of an intense, stored beam, we are interested in
the formation of beam halo, either as a diffuse cloud, rep-
resented by a departure from a Gaussian distribution, or as
droplets which may occur in a type of phase transition at
beam’s edge due to coherent modes. In addition, it is use-
ful to study the formation of an equilibrium state, if it ex-
ists, between a broad spectrum of marginally stable modes
and some weak dissipative mechanisms that can lead to a
saturated state of low-level turbulence, which, in turn, can
affect the rate at which the halo population is generated.
These phenomena can be expected to be most prevalent in
hadron rings owing to the weakness of the damping mech-
anisms, and our attention in this paper is focussed on this
case.

While these subjects are mathematically complex, a rich

literature already exists in the ﬁeld of plasma physics that
deals with these questions, although the interparticle force
predominantly considered in this literature is due to space
charge alone. At the relativistic energies typical in modern
accelerators, the interaction between particles is dominated
by wall image currents, i.e.
the wakeﬁelds, which com-
plicates the nature of the interaction, but can also lead to
a wider variety of wave phenomena. It is our aim in this
work to highlight observations of nonlinear wave phenom-
ena in high-energy synchrotrons and to point out methods
of analysis from plasma physics that can be applied to the
study of these topics.

The types of wave behavior in beams may be classiﬁed
according to the degree of nonlinearity, in parallel with the
concepts in plasma physics. In the linear regime, a reso-
nant mode can be driven resulting in a response at the drive
frequency which is characteristic of the beam intensity and
the nature of the wakeﬁeld, or impedance, of the machine.
When detected by a suitable pick-up, the driven response
can shed light on the properties of the wakeﬁelds and the
proximity of the beam to the stability threshold. This so-
called transfer function method [1] is widely used to study
accelerator stability.

If an accelerator is operated just above its stability limit,
the most unstable mode is driven into exponential growth
by the wakes, reaching a saturated, though marginally sta-
ble, state as the beam distribution is altered by the growing
If the spectrum of unstable modes is sufﬁciently
waves.
broad, the phase of the perturbation is effectively random,
and the interaction of waves and particles leads to parti-
cle diffusion in phase space, known in plasma physics as
quasi-linear diffusion [2]. The analog in beams, known as
the ’overshoot’ phenomenon, has been studied [3],[4], al-
though the applicability of this model is unclear owing to
the typically narrow unstable spectrum found in many stor-
age rings. A recent numerical study of this phenomenon
that shows the complexity of the interaction is found in ref.
[5].

However, particularly in hadron rings where the absence
of synchrotron damping allows virtually unimpeded mode
growth, unstable waves can grow to ﬁnite amplitudes that
permit a signiﬁcant fraction of the beam to become trapped
in its own wake. The resulting wave motion couples to the
trapped particles in such a way as to give rise to slowly
damped oscillations. This phenomenon is known as non-
linear Landau damping in the plasma physics literature [6]
(in comparison to linear Landau damping which is part of

the linear beam response). It is to be expected that where a
discrete spectrum of unstable waves can occur, as is often
the case in a synchrotron, that nonlinear Landau damping
can play an important role.

At the next higher level of nonlinear interaction, coher-
ent modes can resonantly interact in a process known as
the three- wave interaction [7]. This leads typically to a
cascade in frequency which, due to the harmonic charac-
ter of many modes in storage rings, readily occurs and can
cause a broadening of the original unstable spectrum. This
phenomenon has been studied in the simple case of longi-
tudinal oscillations in a coasting beam, [8] and it can be
expected that similar wave-wave coupling can occur in the
transverse plane and in bunched beams as well, albeit with
different resonance conditions.

If the coherent motion is particularly violent, and sufﬁ-
ciently dissipative, then the trapped portion of the beam can
self-extract from the core of the beam distribution, forming
droplets at the beam edge that can be self-sustaining. These
are, presumably, a form of solitary wave, or soliton, which
is perhaps unique to a high-energy synchrotron due to the
complex character of the wake ﬁeld. Such solitary waves
may be a primary producer of halo particles for weakly-
damped hadron rings.

In general, we are interested in the ﬁnal state of these var-
ious nonlinear interactions: the condition where the coher-
ent modes reach marginal stability through either a change
in the beam distribution, or through frequency spreading
of the spectral distribution. In the latter case, the phonons
themselves can be thought of as comprising a ﬂuid which
comes into equilibrium, the details of which depend on the
inter-phonon interaction. In the plasma physics literature,
scaling laws for the resulting turbulent ﬂuctuation spectrum
have been derived ([9] and references contained therein).
For our purposes, we would like to understand how aspects
of the machine impedance, and therefore the detailed de-
sign, contribute to the form of the equilibrium turbulent
spectrum, if it exists.

In this paper we review the observations made at Fermi-
lab [8] in stored high energy hadron beams and compare
the observations with numerical simulations. Our exper-
imental studies, and thus our theoretical work, have been
focussed on the phenomena in perhaps the simplest of all
cases, that of longitudinal oscillations of a coasting, or un-
bunched, beam in a storage ring. As such, the surface of
this subject has only been scratched, and our aim here is to
outline the steps that would have to be taken to study any of
the many other possible situations where nonlinear waves
can occur. Moreover, we would like to underscore the im-
portance of understanding turbulence in beams that we feel
will be playing an increasingly important role as beams are
more commonly run close to, or even above, their linear
stability boundaries.

2.1 Stability in Particle Beams

In the case of a high-energy stored beam, the growth of co-
herent wave motion is normally undesireable. Wakeﬁelds
can drive such waves, though the mode growth is counter-
acted by damping due to the spread in frequencies of the
individual particles making up the beam, and this damp-
ing effect was ﬁrst derived for a plasma, known as Landau
damping [10]. A well known technique for determining
the linear stability boundary of a beam is to excite driven
oscillations on the beam and to monitor the amplitude and
phase of the beam’s response, which includes the effects of
wakeﬁelds. This technique, known as a beam transfer func-
tion, [1], yields for longitudinal motion in a coasting beam
a response of the form

2 REVIEW OF BASIC PHENOMENA

The stability boundary can be depicted in the impedance
plane as the curve for which Im(Ω) = 0, as shown in Fig.1.

The machine impedance can be extracted from the mea-
surements as an offset of the centroid of the stability curve,
provided the beam distribution is known, assumed to be
Gaussian here.

2.2 The Three-Wave Interaction

Weakly nonlinear processes are described using the same
techniques as in linear stability theory, with the excep-
tion that a second-order frequency mixing term is in-
cluded in the description of the dynamics. The effect of
the frequency-mixing leads to a resonant coupling phe-
nomenon by which modes at two separate frequencies cou-
ple to produce a response at a third frequency, a process
known as three-wave or parametric coupling. The process
is characterized by selection rules such that

ω1 = ω2 + ω3

(3)

corresponding to conservation of energy among the waves.
A similar condition applies to the mode wavenumbers, cor-
responding to conservation of momentum. Due to the peri-
odicity in a ring, this condition can be readily satisﬁed for
a large number of normal modes. We have studied the cou-
pling for longitudinal modes theoretically and found three-
wave coupling obeys a dispersion relation that couples the
linear response of harmonic m and m-n through an idler
mode at harmonic n.

The implication of Eq. 4 is that three-wave coupling is
most likely near the stability threshold for any of the modes
involved. The selection rule Eq. 3 leads to a single-sided
coupling, which was observed experimentally, as shown in
Fig. 2.

An interesting issue to investigate is how the power in
the excited modes varies in time, especially in the presence

modes in a coasting beam in the Tevatron, 150 GeV beam.
Excitation at h = 1000, (47.712 MHz) as shown in the up-
per graph, led to successive excitation of lower sidebands
accompanied by low frequency modes, shown in the lower
graph, which satisfy the selection rule. The lower graph be-
gins at zero frequency and in each ﬁgure the frequency span

of damping. Experimental observations indicate that a very
regular cascade toward lower frequencies takes place, evi-
dently due to successive three-wave coupling events. This
behavior is typical for a dissipative system with sufﬁciently
high mode density, and may be described by the following
system of equations for the mode amplitudes.

It is worthwhile to note that as the multiplicity of modes
(cid:12)
becomes sufﬁciently dense, the coupling between waves
governed by Eq. 6 can lead to a solitary wave phenomenon
[11], and this subject will be described further in a later
section.
In the above mentioned work, only the interac-
tion of longitudinal modes has been considered. It is also
reasonable to expect that transverse modes can be coupled,
especially where nonlinearities can play an important role,
such as in the beam-beam interaction. This should be a
fruitful area for further study.

2.3 Nonlinear Landau Damping

Sufﬁciently large wakeﬁelds disturb an initially smooth
particle distribution by trapping particles within the po-
tential wells of the waves generated. The particle motion
decoheres with a time constant that is signiﬁcantly longer
than the inverse frequency spread, or linear Landau damp-
ing time. The trapped particles undergo synchrotron os-
cillations in the self-generated potential wells, alternately
exchanging incremental energy with the wakeﬁelds. The
combination of energy dispersion of the particles and the
nonlinearity of the voltage waveform eventually causes
phase mixing of the coherent motion. This nonlinear damp-
ing process is called nonlinear Landau damping, and was
ﬁrst studied in plasma physics. [6], [12] - [16].

Experiments were carried out in the Fermilab Main Ring
which clearly showed the signature of nonlinear Landau

damping. In these studies, a short pulse of rf power was ap-
plied to the beam using an rf cavity at h=106 (5.03 MHz).
The resulting response showed a characteristic response
whose envelope decayed not exponentially but in an oscil-
latory manner, as shown in 3. This behavior is attributed
to the exchange of energy between trapped particles and
waves as described above. Both analytic [16], [12], [15],
and numerical work [14], on nonlinear Landau damping
has been carried out which descibes the behavior we have
observed. This result will also be discussed further in a
later section on simulations.

It has also been pointed out [16] that the advent of parti-
cle bunching is accompanied by the appearance of coherent
power in higher harmonics of the fundamental frequency
of the wakeﬁeld as the trapped particle bunches compress
within the potential wells. Such behavior has indeed been
observed in the experiments described above [8]. This
compression of the bunch length is essentially wavefront
steepening which is a prerequisite for the formation of soli-
tons.

2.4

Solitary Waves.

The formation of solitons in a beam is of interest, since soli-
tons may well be the vehicle which carries coherent energy
in a highly turbulent state that might occur in a beam with
weak damping. A vast literature on solitons in various me-
dia exists [17] - [20], though little effort has been given to
this subject in ultra-relativistic beams. In particular, soli-
tons in plasmas have been studied extensively, [18], [20],
which depend on the particular nonlinearity introduced by
the Coulomb force, i.e.
space charge. A similar space
charge limit was studied for a coasting beam [21], [22], and
for a resonator impedance, [23], leading to the possibility
that solitons may exist in high energy beams under certain
conditions.

Since a wakeﬁeld force is fundamentally more complex
than the space charge force, it can be assumed that the char-
acteristics of a soliton will also be unique to the case of a
high-energy beam. In particular, it is interesting to know
what the impact of the wakeﬁeld dissipation has on the soli-
tary wave behavior. Results from a variety of beam experi-
ments suggest that long-lived solitary structures may form
and extract themselves from the core of the beam over long
times [24], [25].
In other work, transient solitary waves
seem to appear [8]. In all cases, solitons may be viewed
as phase-space droplets that appear in the beam, and under
some conditions, give rise to a phase-transition and clumpy
halo formation. From this point of view, it is valuable to
understand their dynamics.

To this end we sketch here the results of an analytic study
of longitudinal solitons on a coasting beam due to a general
resonator impedance. This reperesents the simplest possi-
ble scenario for understanding such phenomena, will illus-
trate the mathematical procedure and serves as the starting
point for more complex situations. For the reader’s sake
we note that many steps have been omitted from the fol-
lowing derivation for reasons of space. Full details will be

given in forthcoming work [26]. The model equations for
the dynamics are given by the following system

constant is the equilibrium beam density.) Using a renor-
malization group approach [26], [27], we may derive a set
of amplitude equations for the rescaled beam density Ro,
the current velocity uo and the mode envelope function E.
Before proceeding, we would like to examine the stabil-
ity problem of stationary waves in this system, which can
be done without a formal solution of the amplitude equa-
tions. The approach, introduced by Sagdeev [18], is to look
for forms of the nonlinear equations which correspond to
harmonic motion in an effective potential well. Such states,
if they exist, are conjectured to be allowed solitary waves
in the nonlinear system. To this end let us write down the
full system of amplitude equations, which after appropriate
scaling reads as

Eq. 13 admits closed form solutions that indicate solitary
waves can exist, but due to the dissipation in the model,
eventually disappear after initial generation. We interpret
this behavior as a gradual shrinking of the potential well
that occurs when the trapped particles have decelerated suf-
ﬁciently from the the resonantor frequency. The results
for the voltage amplitude and soliton (caviton) density are
shown in Figs. 5 and 6 respectively. We note that a similar
equation has been derived [22] from an entirely different
perspective. It is also worth noting that Eq. 13 is a special
case of the complex, cubic Ginzburg-Landau equation [29],
widely used to study various pattern formation phenomena
and coherent structures.

2.5

Turbulence.

The study of turbulence in beams is valuable primarily be-
cause it may be a universal phenomenon, at least at low
levels, which plays a role in determining the limiting phase-
space density in any machine. The effect has likely been
small in machines well below their stability thresholds,
however, as intensities have been pushed closer to stability
limits, nonlinear wave interactions can occur which lead to
a marginally stable equilibrium. A ﬁrst attempt at deter-
mining the ﬂuctuation spectrum for a beam was obtained
by considering the equilibrium state of a Gaussian beam
[30]. The resulting spectrum was related to the linear di-
electric function and showed that the ﬂuctuation density
would be strongly peaked for cases near the linear stabil-
ity limit. It is our conjecture that such a situation may have

occurred in the Fermilab Tevatron during recent attempts to
realize stochastic cooling of bunched beams [31]. A broad,
stationary spectrum of ﬂuctuations was observed at many
times the expected Schottky, or shot noise, levels. The
harmonic generation observed in the Fermilab Main Ring
mentioned above is consistent with these observations as
well. It is our aim in this paper to outline a theoretical ap-
proach to understand the formation of an equilibrium spec-
trum and to understand the spectral amplitude dependence
on the character of the machine impedance.

The approach taken is to develop a statistical description
of ﬂuctuations for an ensemble of coupled modes. This
may be viewed as a development of the amplitude equa-
tions associated with coupled modes, as in Eq. 6. The
interaction between modes may be three-wave, as given in
6, or higher-order. In this work, we outline a general proce-
dure, but keep only interactions up to the three-wave level.
The result will be a scaling law for the envelope of the ﬂuc-
tuation spectrum.

The starting point for our analysis is the system of equa-
tions for the ﬂuctuation δN of the microscopic phase space
density and the ﬂuctuation δV of the voltage [9]

We note that this power law spectrum, which in this case
is due to a resonator, would indeed lead to the type of broad
ﬂuctuation spectrum seen in experiments. However, at this
time, a detailed study of the scaling of the observed spec-
trum has not been made. An extension of the above work
to consider bunched beams, and other types of machine
impedance would be very worthwhile.

3 SIMULATIONS

In this work, we are interested in demonstrating examples
of the nonlinear wave behavior we have described analyt-
ically. No attempt is made to closely model a real device,
though this could be done with the building blocks we pro-
vide here. We shall concentrate on the longitudinal plane,
as explained above, and carry out simulations exculsively
on a coasting, (unbunched) beam, for simplicity. We adopt
the resonator model described above and follow approx-
imately the procedure adopted in early simulation work
[32]. The particle evolution equations are given by

The energy dispersion η is assumed to be a constant and
the particle distribution is advanced each time step accord-
ing to Eq. 18. Then the current is computed, followed by
the voltage on the resonator using Eq. 18. Results for the
case of a coasting beam are shown in Figure 7 - 9. The
simulation parameters are given in Table 1.

In Fig. 7, the phase-space distribution is shown, initially
assumed to be uniform in θ and Gaussian in energy. Af-
ter 500 time steps, the resonator has developed a sinusoidal
voltage from the initial noise level (due to the ﬁnite num-
ber of particles) which has succeeded in bunching a large
fraction of the beam and synchrotron motion in the result-
ing potential well is taking place. The synchrotron motion
can also be thought of as synonymous to the wave-breaking
process which has been described in plasma physics [12].
As time proceeds, Fig. 8, shows a deceleration of the
trapped particles from the core of the beam, and the decel-
erated portion remains well-organized, and even intensiﬁes
as its length is foreshortened. The voltage in the resonator
then becomes phase-locked to the ’droplets’ and the voltage
amplitude oscillates as they move in and out of phase with

Figure 8: Phase-space after 1000 time steps. Portions of
the originally trapped particle population have decelerated
from the core due to the ﬁnite resistivity of the wakeﬁelds.
The solitons remain, however, well-organized as they expe-
rience deceleration. Both the cavity voltage and the density
perturbations have decreased, but persist for long times.
The diagrams have the same meaning as in the previous
ﬁgure.

the remaining coherent structure in the beam’s core. We
note that the droplets thus formed bear the characteristics
of the solitons discussed in the previous section, remaining
self-organized for long times.

As the dissipation in the impedance continues to decel-
erate the solitons Fig. 9, the resonator voltage drops due to
the high Q value, or narrow bandwidth, assumed. This, in
turn, reduces the deceleration rate and the depth of the po-
tential wells that can sustain the solitons. As such, a steady
state can be reached where the remaining trapped particles
reach a stable equilibrium outside the beam, in accord with
the analytic model for solitary waves. The envelope of the
cavity voltage and the mean energy deviation of the solitons
are shown in Fig. 10, indicating deceleration of the trapped
particles. A steady state is eventually reached, though not
shown, where the solitons have moved sufﬁciently off res-
onance that the deceleration ceases.

We show the ﬁnal results for a low-Q cavity in Fig. 11.
These are qualitatively the same as in the previous case,
but the structure of the solitons has taken on a decidedly
random character. This is evidently due to the fact that
the fractional contribution of noise to the cavity voltage is
larger, owing to the wider bandwidth of the cavity, result-
ing in a more random distribution of potential well sizes.
Droplet, or soliton formation, still occurs, but the resulting
ﬂuctuation spectrum is broader. The onset of the solitary
waves can be viewed as a phase transition at the beam’s
edge produced by the resonator’s wakeﬁeld. This is the
case, we believe, that is most frequently encountered in ac-
tual machines.
We note that the ﬂuctuation spectrum associated with the

core is now largely decohered, however, the solitons con-
tinue to decelerate slowly and maintain the remaining cav-
ity voltage well off resonance. The diagrams have the same
meaning as in the previous ﬁgure.

above distribution is due to the ensemble of strongly non-
linear waves and is likely beyond the realm of the three-
wave interaction described in the scaling law in the previ-
ous section. An interesting study to be carried out is the
experimental and theoretical determination of the spectral
shape in a machine whose impedance is well-known.

4 CONCLUSIONS

In this work we have attempted to outline various levels of
nonlinearity in coherent interactions in high-energy beams.
Besides the general academic interest of nonlinear dynam-
ics, for which high-energy beams provide an excellent test-
ing ground, there are at least two areas where the study of
nonlinear waves can ﬁnd application in accelerator physics.
The ﬁrst is the study of halo formation in which the non-
linear evolution of coherent ﬂuctuations can lead to soli-
ton, or droplet, formation, as described in previous sec-
tions. While there is suggestive experimental evidence that
such states can occur, there has been little detailed study
of this phenomenon, and we assert that there is much to
be learned about machine wakeﬁelds through the study
of solitary waves and their interactions. Speciﬁcally, we
have only considered the simplest case, that of longitudi-

Figure 10: Cavity voltage envelope and mean energy devi-
ation. The upper curve is the envelope of the cavity volt-
age, showing the exchange of energy between the soliton
and the wakeﬁeld. The lower curve is the mean energy of
the perturbation, which descends away from the beam, but
eventually reaches an equilibrium (not shown) where the
deceleration ceases.

nal waves in an unbunched beam, and there are many other
cases of interest in high-energy accelerators.

The second application is the study of non-equilibrium
ﬂuctuations driven by wakeﬁelds. Nonlinear mode-mode
coupling permits a frequency cascade, both toward lower
and higher frequencies via separate processes. The pho-
ton distribution that results is an equilibrium between the
nonlinear interactions producing the cascade and weak dis-
sipative mechanisms. These mechanisms are assumed to
be related to the broadband impedance of the machine,
though other mechanisms may also be responsible. We
have carried out a model calculation for a speciﬁc form of
impedance that yields a speciﬁc scaling law for the turbu-
lent spectrum. A number of assumptions come into play in
the development of this model and the situation is ripe for
careful experimental testing. The beneﬁt of this study is the
understanding of the signiﬁcance of low-level turbulence in
the limiting parameters of a given accelerator.

At a warm linear collider the short time interval at which
bunches will pass near each other in the interaction region may
lead to signiﬁcant alteration of the bunches positions.
In this paper we quantify the intensity of this eﬀect and show
that it can be addressed by a fast intra-pulse feedback system.

1 Beam-beam interaction and beam blow up

at a warm linear collider

In a linear collider, near the interaction point (IP) after the ﬁnal magnet
the two beams are not any more shielded from each other by the beam pipe.
Thus if the outgoing beam has been deﬂected vertically at the interaction
point it will induce a vertical deﬂection of the incoming beam, leading to a
loss of luminosity (see ﬁgure 1) and a blow up of the beam along the train.
Let the vertical oﬀset of the k-th electron (positron) bunch at the IP in
(∆(+)
) and deﬁne the relative oﬀset by
k

units of the rms. beam size σy be ∆(−)

Then, the oﬀsets with interaction are obtained successively by[1]

where Dx(y) is the horizontal (vertical) disruption parameter, σx(z) the hor-
izontal (longitudinal) bunch size, φ the crossing angle, N the number of
bunches that a given bunch sees on its journey from the last quad to the IP.
The form factor F (∆) is deﬁned by

F (∆) =

where re is the classical electron radius, Np the number of particles in a
bunch, γ the particle energy in units of rest mass and θy the beam deﬂection
angle when the beam oﬀset is ∆, as shown on ﬁgure 2. (F (∆) ≈ ∆, when
Dy ≪ 1 and |∆| ≪ 1.)

This number N can be calculated using the following formula:

N =

2 × distance between IP and last quad
Bunch spacing × c

(here c is the velocity of the beam taken as the velocity of the light in the
calculations below).

(θy) as a function the bunch oﬀ-
set at the interaction point (∆k).
The parameters used for this sim-
ulation are those of the GLC and
of CLIC as given in table 1.

An interesting point to note in this formula is that the oﬀset is indepen-
dent of the location at which bunch k and l cross each other. This happens
because two diﬀerent eﬀects compensate each other. On the one hand the fur-
ther away from the IP the crossing happens, the bigger the distance between
bunches k and l is and thus the smaller the deﬂection angle of the bunch k
will be. But one the other hand, the distance travelled by the bunch after
receiving this kick will be longer, thus making the oﬀset at the IP bigger.

The simulations presented in this paper have been done using CAIN [2]
with two sets of parameters, one close to the proposed parameters of the
GLC (Global Linear Collider) and the othe closer to the CLIC speciﬁcations.
The parameters’ values used for these studies are adopted from the ITRC
report [3] and are summarized in table 1.

2 Eﬀect of the crossing angle and the other
beam parameters on the beam blow up

The two parameters that have the biggest inﬂuence on the beam blow up
are the crossing angle and the number (N) of outgoing bunches seen by
an incoming bunch. The ﬁgure 3 shows how the blow up (simulated as
described by equation 1 ) varies when the crossing angle varies from the
smallest proposed value (7 mrad) to a much less challenging value (30 mrad)
and the table 2 indicates the vertical oﬀset of the last bunch of the train (It
is assumed that ∆k,0 is the same for all bunches of a train). F

As one can see on this ﬁgure, for an initial oﬀset of 1σy, even with a
crossing angle of 7 mrad the maximum beam oﬀset at the GLC due to the
beam blow up does not exceed 3 σy. For a crossing angle of 10 mrad or more
the beam oﬀset remains below 1.6 σy. At CLIC the shorter bunch spacing

7 mrad and 5.3 σy for a crossing angle of 10 mrad. For wider crossing angle,
the blow up remains below 2 σy. If the initial oﬀset is bigger (5 σy or 10
σy) then the ﬁnal oﬀset increases but the increase, which is related to the
form factor shown on ﬁgure 2, is less than linear and the normalized oﬀset
( bunch oﬀset
initial oﬀset ) is smaller, as shown on ﬁgure 4).

To minimize the blowup eﬀect it is better to locate the last quad closer to
the IP but this is not desirable for the detector performance. Instead, it may
be possible to keep the incoming and outgoing beam in separate pipes until

they are very close from the IP, thus shielding them for each other’s inﬂuence
and reducing N, the number of outgoing bunches seen by an incoming bunch
(and thus the blow up).

On ﬁgure 5 one can see the inﬂuence of N (number of outgoing bunches
seen by an incoming bunch) on the blow up. The oﬀset of the last bunch of
the train for various values of N is given in table 3. As shown previously, at
very small crossing angle (7 mrad), the beam blow up is very important and
thus the unshielded length has a strong inﬂuence on the total blow up. With
sch crossing angle reducing the unshielded length by 20 cm, from 4.2 m to
4.0 m can reduce the vertical oﬀset of the last bunch of the train by more
than 1.0σy for both the GLC and CLIC. At higher crossing angle (20 mrad),
the beam blow up is much lower and thus the unshielded length has a smaller
inﬂuence on the blow up.

end of the train for diﬀerent values of N (number of outgoing bunches seen
by an incoming bunch) for two diﬀerent crossing angle values (the other
parameters have the values mentionned in table 1). N is proportionnal to
the length during whih the two beam are not shielded from each other in the
interaction region (IR).

3 Blow up and fast feedback system

Ground motion and other sources of vibrations may induce random changes
in the beam oﬀset from train. To reduce the luminosity lost due to this
oﬀset fast intra-pulse feedback systems have been proposed for the GLC
(and the NLC)[4, 5, 6] to correct the beam oﬀset by measuring the oﬀset
of the deﬂected outgoing pulses with a beam position monitor (BPM) and
correcting the incoming pulses with a kicker. After initial correction a delay
loop acts to prevent the system from forgetting the correction already applied.
As the beam blow up also results in a beam oﬀset, the fast intrapulse

feedback systems can also deal with it.

Mathematically the eﬀect (dk) of the feedback system described in [4] on

buch k can be described as follow:

if (k > b) then δk = 0 and dk = 0
if (k ≥ b) then δk = g ∗ F (∆k−b)

and dk = δk + dk−b

(5)
(6)
(7)

Where ∆k,0 is the initial oﬀset of the k-th bunch (as deﬁned above),
F (∆k) is the relative angle with which bunch k was deﬂected (F is shown
on ﬁgure 2), b is the number of bunches separing the BPM of the feedback
system from the kicker, g is the gain of the system (typically 0.6 for the GLC
in normal conditions) and δk is the correction speciﬁc to bunch k to which
the correction dk−b (memorized by the delay loop) is added to give dk, the

8

total correction to be applied.

This correction dk is directly substracted from ∆k, 0 before computing
the eﬀect of the beam beam blow up as shown on equation 1. The electronic
circuit of the system described in [4] is shown on ﬁgure 6.

Figure 6: Circuit of the FEATHER[4] fast intra-pulse feedback system.

The eﬀect of the beam blow up on the performance of these fast intra-
pulse feedback systems is shown on ﬁgure 7. As one can see when the crossing
angle is wide and thus blow up is not too intense (10 mrad and more for the
GLC, 20 mrad and more for CLIC), the fast feedback system can correct the
beam blow up whereas for smaller crossing angles the blow up drives the feed-
back system into oscillations between over-correction and under-correction.
These oscillations come from the delay between the time at which a cor-
rection is applied and the time at which the BPM measures the eﬀects of this
correction. Thus after correcting for a given eﬀect the system still measure
“uncorrected” bunches. This delay is induced by the time of ﬂight from the
kicker to the BPM and by the latency of the electronics used. The ﬁgure 8
shows that these oscillations appear regardless of the position of the fast feed-
back system (or the latency induced by the electronics), but their intensity
increases when the system is located further away from the IP.

The delay loop of the fast feedback system (see ﬁgure 6) addresses some
of the problems created by the system’s latency but it slows the capacity
of the system to adapt to changing conditions such as those created by the
beam blow up.

Thus to avoid the oscillations in the fast feedback system, one needs to
add a second component to the correction predicted by the feedback system.
The intensity of this second component must be directly proportional to

Figure 9: Modiﬁed fast intra-pulse feedback system to avoid the oscillations
created by the beam blow up. Compared to the FEATHER[4] circuit one
extra branch has been added that directly takes the beam position signal
and bypasses the delay loop.

Mathematically this new circuit requires the addtion of a new term ǫk to

equation 7 to compute the correction ck:

if (k > b) then δk = dk = ǫk = ck = 0
if (k ≥ b) then δk = g ∗ F (∆k−b)
and ǫk = gb ∗ F (∆k−b)
and dk = δk + dk−b
and ck = dk + ǫk

(8)
(9)
(10)
(11)
(12)

Where ck is the correction to be applied and gb is a proportionnality
coeﬃcient (the gain of the feedback branch). The only diﬀerence between δk
and ǫk is that the later is not included in the recursive term dk.

The performances of this modiﬁed circuit are shown on ﬁgure 10. The
gains used for these numerical simulations are g = 0.2 and gb = 1 for the
GLC with a crossing angle of 7 mrad, g = 0.05 and gb = 18 for CLIC at the
same crossing angle. With a crossing angle of 10 mrad these values become
g = 0.5/gb = 0.16 (GLC) and g = 0.05/gb = 11.25 (CLIC). These values have
been obtained by tuning the system to minimize the luminosity loss. The

4 Blow up correction based only on the ﬁrst

bunch measurement

As the oﬀset of each bunch of the train is only aﬀected by events (ground mo-
tion, transverse long-range wakeﬁeld, compensation error of beam-loading,...)
that are known once the ﬁrst bunch of the train reaches the IP, the correc-
tion to be applied to each bunch can be predicted once the oﬀset of the
ﬁrst bunch is known. This property could be used to design a system that
would compute the correction to be applied to each bunch based mainly on
the measurement of the oﬀset of the ﬁrst bunch of the train. To cope with
residual ground motion, a simple feedback system (without delay loop) must
be added to this system. As the correction to be applied as a function of the
bunch oﬀset is not linear such system would have to be tuned for a given
oﬀset at which it would perform the best. The simple feedback loop would
then perform the second order adjustements to remove the residual beam oﬀ-
set. By using switches it would be possible to switch between diﬀerent sets
of gains tuned for diﬀerent initial oﬀsets. The ﬁgure 11 shows an example of
circuit (without switch) that could be used to implement such system. The
ﬁgure 12 shows the performances of such circuit.

Figure 12: Correction of the beam oﬀset using the circuit shown on ﬁgure 11.
The gain used for the simple feedback loop is 0.5 for the GLC and 0.7 for
CLIC. The gains used in the other part of the circuit have been tuned so
that the beam oﬀset becomes null if the initial oﬀset was 1.

As one can see the performances of such system are rather attractive but
the number of attenuators and wires required would be proportional to the
number of bunches times the number of switches needed. This huge number
of wires needed might be a problem as it would increase the amount of dead
material in the detector.

It is important to stress that in the two models presented in the previous
section and the one in this section only analog electronics have been used
but by the date at which the linear collider will be built very fast digital
electronics will probably be available allowing a better correction of the end
of the train.

5 Conclusion

The beam beam interactions at a warm linear collider such as the GLC or
CLIC will create a blow up of the beam, especially at low crossing angle. If
the crossing angle is wide enough then the blow up will be corrected by the
fast intra-pulse feedback system. For smaller crossing angle the blow up will
interfere with the feedback system but minor modiﬁcations of the feedback
system will remove these inteferences and correct the beam blow up.

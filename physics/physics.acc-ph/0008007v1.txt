QUADRUPOLE MISALIGNMENTS AND STEERING IN LONG LINACS ∗

G. V. Stupakov

Abstract

We present a study of orbit jitter and emittance growth
in a long linac caused by misalignment of quadrupoles.
First, assuming a FODO lattice, we derive analytical for-
mulae for the RMS deviation of the orbit and the emittance
growth caused by random uncorrelated misalignments of
all quadrupoles. We then consider an alignment algorithm
based on minimization of BPM readings with a given BPM
resolution and ﬁnite mover steps.

INTRODUCTION

In this paper we study the emittance dilution of a beam
caused by quadrupole misalignments in a long linac. To
suppress the beam break-up instability an energy spread is
usually introduced in the beam. For the Next Linear Col-
lider (NLC) [1], the rms energy spread within the bunch
will be of order of 1%. Due to the lattice chromaticity, the
deﬂection of the beam by displaced quadrupoles results in
the dilution of the phase space and the growth of the pro-
jected emittance.

The effect of lattice misalignments has been previously
studied in many papers. A qualitative analysis and main
scalings were obtained in Ref. [2], and detailed studies
with intensive computer simulations are described in Refs.
[3, 4, 5]. The purpose of this paper is to develop a simple
model based on a FODO lattice approximation for the linac
which allows an analytic calculation of the emittance dilu-
tion. The model can be also generalized, to include a slow
variation of the lattice parameters, as well as variation of
both beam energy and the energy spread [6].

Throughout this paper we assume that the number of
quadrupoles in the linac is large, N ≫ 1, and neglect terms
of the relative order of N −1 in the calculations. For future
linear colliders with the center of mass energy in the range
of 1 TeV, typically N ∼ 103, and N −1 is indeed a small
number.

Let us consider a FODO lattice with a cell length l and a
phase advance µ per cell, consisting of N thin quadrupoles
as shown in Fig. 1. The focal length of the quadrupoles is
equal to ±F where the positive and negative values of F
refer to the focusing and defocusing quadrupoles respec-
tively. The beam is injected in the linac at the center of the
ﬁrst quadrupole, at s = 0, with the zero offset and angle,
and the beam emittance is measured at the center of the
last, N th, quadrupole. For the beam position (horizontal or
vertical) at the locations of the quadrupoles we will use the
notation x1, x2, . . . , xN −1, xN , and the orbit angle at the
k. The initial
center of the kth quadrupole is denoted by x′
conditions for the orbit are x1 = x′
1 = 0. Note that due to
our choice of positions, the derivative of the beta function,
and hence the Twiss parameter α, at all locations 1 through
N , are equal to zero.

We now assume that each quadrupole in the lattice is
misaligned in the transverse direction relative to the axis
of the linac by ξi, (1 ≤ i ≤ N ), where ξi are random,
uncorrelated numbers. Due to the deﬂection by misaligned
quadrupoles, the original straight orbit will be perturbed.
The offset xi can be found as
xi = Xk<i

where Rik is the (1, 2) element of the transfer matrix R
and θi is the deﬂection angle resulting from the offset of
the ith quadrupole, θi = ±ξi/F , for the focusing and de-
focusing quadrupoles. We have Rik = √βiβk sin ∆ψik,
where the betatron phase advance ∆ψik between kth and
ith quadrupoles (k < i) is ∆ψik = (1/2)(i − k)µ.

To characterize the deviation of the orbit from the linac
axis, we will calculate the average value hx2
Ni, where the
angular brackets denote averaging over all possible values
of ξ. We assume that the average offset hξii vanishes, hence
hxNi = 0.
For the lattice shown in Fig. 1 the deﬂection angle θk
due to the misaligned kth quadrupole is given by θk =

(−1)kξk/F , and the beam offset at the end of the linac is

dominant contribution to ∆ǫ comes from the dependence
of the phase advance ∆ψik versus energy, so we need to

4 CHROMATIC EMITTANCE GROWTH

When the beam has a nonzero energy spread, due to the
chromaticity of the lattice, the misalignments cause an ef-
fective emittance growth of the beam [2]. We will calculate
the emittance increase, assuming that the beam energy E
and the relative energy spread in the beam δ are constant.
We will also assume that the resulting emittance growth is
much smaller than the initial emittance of the beam. In this
case, we can use the following formula for the ﬁnal emit-
tance growth

∆ǫ =

1

2 (cid:2)β−1

N h(∆x − h∆xi)2iξδ
+ βNh(∆x′ − h∆x′i)2iξδ(cid:3) ,

(7)

where ∆x and ∆x′ are the spread in the coordinate and
the angle within the bunch at the and of the linac, and the
angular brackets with the subscript ξδ denote a double av-
eraging: ﬁrst, averaging over the random misalignment of
the quadrupoles and then averaging over the energy dis-
tribution function in the beam. We will assume that the
energy spread in the beam δ is so small, that one can use a
linear approximation for calculation of ∆x and ∆x′, ∆x =
δ · xN δ ≡ δ · ∂xN /∂δ and ∆x′ = δ · x′
N /∂δ.

As we see, the increase in the emittance scales with the
number of quadrupoles as N 3.

In the above derivation, to ﬁnd the dispersion of the beam
at the end of the linac, we explicitly differentiated Eq. (3)
with respect to the energy. One can use another formula for
computing ∂xN /∂δ [6],

that takes into account that the dispersion is generated due
to the offset of the particle relative to the center of the
quadrupole, and propagates downstream with the same ma-
trix element RN k.

5 VERY LONG LINAC

Increasing the length of the linac and the number of
quadrupoles N brings us to the regime where Eq. (10) is
not valid any more. The transition occurs when the phase
advance over the length of the linac due to the energy vari-
ation δ becomes comparable to π/2, N δ· dµ/dδ ∼ π/2. In
this case, the differential approximation ∆x = δ · ∂xN /∂δ
that was used in Section 4 is not valid any more, and the
scaling ∆ǫ ∝ N 3 breaks down.
We can estimate the emittance dilution in this regime, us-
ing the following arguments. Let us denote by lc the deco-
herence length in the linac such that (lc/l)δ · dµ/dδ ∼ π/2
(l is the FODO cell length). When the beam passes the dis-
tance lc, due to ﬁlamentation, the betatron oscillations of
the beam are converted into the increased emittance, and
the subsequent motion becomes uncorrelated with the pre-
viously excited betatron oscillations. The emittance growth
on the distance lc is given by Eq. (10), in which N = 2lc/l,

(13)

Note that if the linac length lL < lc, the emittance dilu-
tion is reversible in principle – the initial beam emittance
can be recovered by taking out the dispersion generated by
the misaligned quadrupoles downstream of the linac. For
very long linacs, when lL > lc, the emittance growth be-
comes irreversible due to the phase space ﬁlamentation.

6 ALIGNMENT WITH ACCOUNT OF
BPM ERRORS AND FINITE MOVER

STEPS

Measuring the beam position at each quadrupole, with the
knowledge of the lattice functions, allows us to ﬁnd the
quadrupole offsets ξi. Moving the quadrupoles by distance
−ξi would position them in the original state, and restore
the ideal lattice. Of course, in reality, there are many fac-
tors, such as wakeﬁelds and measurement errors, that do
not allow to perfectly align the lattice. Here we will study
two such effects: errors associated with the BPM measure-
ments, and ﬁnite step of the quadrupole movers.

1 . . . xM

Consider ﬁrst the effect of BPM errors. Due to the ﬁnite
resolution of BPMs the measured vector of the beam trans-
N ) differs from the exact
verse offsets X M = (xM
values X = (x1 . . . xN ) by an error vector e, X M = X +e,
where e = (e1 . . . eN ). The errors are small relative to the
measured values, |ei| ≪ |xi|. We assume that the BPMs
are built in the quadrupoles, and the quadrupole displace-
ment ξk also moves the center line of the BMP, so that BPM
k = xk − ξk + ek. Using the measured offsets
reading is xM
k we infer the quadrupole offsets ζk from the following

We see that the rms value of the dispersion at the and of

similar way the variance of the derivative x′

Let us now assume that in addition to the BPM errors the
quadrupole movers have a ﬁnite step so that the ﬁnal posi-
tion of the quadrupoles ζk after alignment is ξk − ζk + rk,
where as above, ζk is the offset inferred from the mea-
surements (and containing BPM errors), and rk is the
quadrupole movement error. Again, we assume that rk are
random, uncorrelated numbers, and of course uncorrelated
with the BPM errors ek. For the beam orbit after alignment
we now have

From this equation, it follows that for a large N , the con-
tribution of the movers errors becomes more important and
imposes tighter tolerances on the movers.

Note that without errors, ek = 0, we would ﬁnd from Eq.
(14) the correct value ζk = ξk. Measurement errors ek
cause the inferred values of the offsets differ from the true
ones, ζk 6= ξk.
We then align the lattice by moving the quadrupoles by
distance −ζk. After the alignment the corrected beam orbit
˜xi does not vanish:

˜xi =

Since the quadrupoles after alignment are located at ξk−ζk,
the beam offset relative to the center of the quadrupole,
˜xk − (ξk − ζk), is equal to −ek. This allows us to use

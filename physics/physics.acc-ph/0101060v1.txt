It has been found that quantum corrections can substantially aﬀect the clas-
sical results of tracking for trajectories close to the separatrix. Hence the
development of a basic formalism for obtaining the quantum maps for any
particle beam optical system is called for. To this end, it is observed that
several aspects of quantum maps for the beam optics of spin- 1
2 particles can
be studied, at the level of single particle dynamics, using the proper formalism
based on the Dirac equation.

1 Introduction

The theory of particle beam optics, currently used in the design and operation of
various beam devices, from electron microscopes to accelerators, is largely based
on classical mechanics and classical electrodynamics. Such a treatment has indeed
been very successful in practice. Of course, whenever it is essential, quantum me-
chanics is used in accelerator physics to understand those quantum eﬀects which are
prominent perturbations to the leading classical beam dynamics [1]. The well-known
examples are quantum excitations induced by synchrotron radiation in storage rings,
the Sokolov-Ternov eﬀect of spin polarization induced by synchrotron radiation, etc.
Recently, attention has been drawn by Hill [2] to the limits placed by quantum me-
chanics on achievable beam spot sizes in particle accelerators, and the need for the
formulation of quantum beam optics relevant to such issues [3]. In the context of
electron microscopy scalar wave mechanics is the main tool to understand the image
formation and its characteristics, and the spin aspects are not generally essential [4].
In the context of accelerator physics it should be certainly desirable to have a
uniﬁed framework based entirely on quantum mechanics to treat the orbital, spin,

radiation, and every aspect of beam dynamics, since the constituents of the beams
concerned are quantum particles. First, this should help us understand better the
classical theory of beam dynamics. Secondly, there is already an indication that this
is necessary too: it has been found [5] that quantum corrections can substantially
aﬀect the classical results of tracking for trajectories close to the separatrix, leading
to the suggestion that quantum maps can be useful in ﬁnding quickly the boundaries
of nonlinear resonances. Thus, a systematic formalism for obtaining the relevant
quantum maps is required. This problem is addressed here for the case of spin- 1
2
particle beams, at the level of single particle dynamics as the ﬁrst step towards a
more comprehensive theory.

2 Quantization of the classical particle beam op-

tics

If the spin is ignored, one may consider obtaining the relevant quantum maps for any
beam optical system by quantizing the corresponding classical treatment directly.
The best way to do this is to use the Lie approach to classical beam dynamics,
thoroughly developed by Dragt et al., [6] particularly in the context of accelerator
physics. Ignoring the eﬀect of spin on the orbital motion, the spin motion has also
been treated classically, independent of the orbital motion, using Lie methods [7].

Let the single particle optical Hamiltonian corresponding to a classical beam
optical system be H(r⊥, p⊥; z), where z is the coordinate along the optic axis of the
system, and r⊥ = (x, y) and p⊥ = (px, py) represent the coordinates and conjugate
momenta, respectively, in the transverse (x, y)-plane. We shall assume the beam
to be moving in the positive z-direction. Then for any observable of the system,
O(r⊥, p⊥), not explicitly dependent on z, the z-evolution equation, or the beam
optical equation of motion, is

dO
dz

=: −H : O ,

where the Lie operator : f : associated with any function of the transverse phase-
space variables, f (r⊥, p⊥), is deﬁned through the Poisson bracket,

When the Hamiltonian H is z-independent the solution of Eq. (1) can be written
down as

followed by a symmetrization to ensure that the quantum operators are hermitian.
From the Heisenberg picture of Eq. (5) let us go to the Schr¨odinger picture in
which a wavefunction ψ (r⊥; z) is associated with the transverse plane at z. The
z-evolution of |ψ(z)i is governed by the beam optical Schr¨odinger equation

with ψ (r⊥; z) normalized as hψ(z)|ψ(z)i = 1.

The formal solution of Eq. (7) is, with |ψii = |ψ(zi)i and |ψf i = |ψ(zf )i,

|ψf i = ˆU (zf , zi) |ψii = ˆUf i|ψii ,

(r⊥i, p⊥i) −→ (r⊥f , p⊥f ) = (R⊥(r⊥i, p⊥i), P ⊥(r⊥i, p⊥i)) ,

then it will correspond to a map of quantum averages as given by

hˆr⊥ii −→ hˆr⊥if = h ˆR⊥(ˆr⊥, ˆp⊥)ii ,

hˆp⊥ii −→ hˆp⊥if = h ˆP ⊥(ˆr⊥, ˆp⊥)ii .

(13)

To see what Eq. (13) implies let us consider, for example, a classical Lie trans-
corresponding to a kick in the xz-plane by a thin sextupole.

This leads to the classical phase-space map
(cid:17)
(cid:16)

xf = xi ,

(14)

as follows from Eq. (4). This would correspond to the quantum Lie transformation
3 ˆx3 :) which leads, as seen from Eq. (13), to the following map for the quantum
exp(: a
averages:

hˆxif = hˆxii ,

hˆpif = hˆpii + ahˆx2ii = hˆpii + ahˆxi2

i + ah(ˆx − hˆxi)2ii .

(15)

Now, we can consider the expectation values, such as hˆxi and hˆpi, as corresponding
to their classical values `a la Ehrenfest. Then, as the above simple example shows,
generally, the leading quantum eﬀects on the classical beam optics can be expected
to be due to the uncertainties in the initial conditions like the term ah(ˆx − hˆxi)2ii in
Eq. (15). As pointed out by Heifets and Yan, [5] such leading quantum corrections
involve the Planck constant ¯h not explicitly but only through the uncertainty prin-
ciple which controls the minimum limits for the initial conditions. This has been

4

realized earlier also [8, 9, 10], particularly in the context of electron microscopy [8, 9].
In a detailed study [5] of a simple example it has been found that trajectories close
to the separatrix are strongly perturbed in spite of very small initial rms (10−15)
and small (1500) number of turns.

As is clear from the above, a quantum formalism derived from the classical beam
optics can be expected to give all the leading quantum corrections to the classical
maps. The question that arises is how to go beyond and obtain the quantum maps
more completely starting ab initio with the quantum mechanics of the concerned
system since such a process should lead to other quantum corrections not derivable
simply from the quantization of the classical optical Hamiltonian. Essentially, one
should obtain the quantum beam optical Hamiltonian ˆH of Eq. (7) directly from the
original time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation of the system. Once ˆH is obtained
Lie methods [6, 7] can be used to construct the quantum z-evolution operator ˆUf i
and study the consequent quantum maps. Derivations of ˆH for the Klein-Gordon
and Dirac particle beams will be discussed in the following sections.

A more complete theory, even at the level of optics, must take into account
multiparticle eﬀects. To this end, it might be proﬁtable to be guided by the mod-
els developed by Fedele et al. [11, 12] (thermal wave model - TWM) and Cufaro
Petroni et al. [13] (stochastic collective dynamical model - SCDM) for treating the
beam phenomenologically as a quasiclassical many-body system. Though the details
of approach and interpretation are diﬀerent, both these models suggest phenomeno-
logical Schr¨odinger-like wavefunction descriptions for the collective motion of the
beam.
In SCDM it is argued
that ¯h is to be replaced by an eﬀective unit of beam emittance given in terms of the
Compton wavelength of the beam particle and the number of particles in the beam.
It may be noted that Lie algebraic tools can be used to handle any Schr¨odinger-like
equation.

In TWM the beam emittance plays the role of ¯h.

3 Using the Klein-Gordon equation ignoring the

spin

One may consider getting a theory of quantum maps for spin- 1

system based on the Klein-Gordon equation ignoring the spin. For this, one has to

are, respectively, the scalar and vector potentials of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds
of the optical system (E = −∇φ, B = ∇ × A). In the standard relativistic quan-
tum theory [14], Feshbach-Villars and Foldy-Wouthuysen techniques are used for
reducing the Klein-Gordon equation to its nonrelativistic approximation plus the
relativistic corrections. Applying analogous techniques in the special case of a quasi-
paraxial (|p⊥| ≪ pz) monoenergetic beam propagating through a system with time-
independent ﬁelds one can reduce Eq. (16) to the beam optical form of Eq. (7) with
ˆH containing a leading paraxial part followed by nonparaxial parts [8, 9, 15]. In this
case the wavefunction in Eq. (16) can be assumed to be of the form

resulting time-independent equation for ψ(r⊥; z) can be regarded as describing the
scattering of the beam particle by the system and transformed into an equation of
the type in Eq. (7) [8, 9, 15].

It must be noted that while the ﬁrst three terms of ˆH in Eq. (18) are exactly the
terms derivable by direct quantization of the classical beam optical Hamiltonian
the last, ¯h-dependent, term is a quantum correction not derivable from the classical
theory. Though such ¯h-dependent terms may seem to be too small, particularly for
high energy beams, they may become eﬀective when there are large ﬂuctuations in
the initial conditions since they essentially modify the coeﬃcients in the classical
maps.

4 The proper theory using the Dirac equation

For a spin- 1
2 particle beam the proper theory should be based on the Dirac equation
if one wants to treat all the aspects of beam optics including spin evolution and
spin-orbit interaction. In such a case the Schr¨odinger equation to start with is

i¯h

Ψ (r⊥, z; t) = ˆHΨ (r⊥, z; t) ,

(19)

where Ψ is now a 4-component spinor and ˆH is the Dirac Hamiltonian

including the Pauli term to take into account the anomalous magnetic moment
µa. In Eq. (20) all the symbols have the usual meanings as in the standard Dirac
theory [14]. Considering the special case of a quasiparaxial monoenergetic beam we
can take Ψ (r⊥, z; t) to be of the form in Eq. (17). Then the 4-component ψ(r⊥; z)
satisﬁes the time-independent Dirac equation

describing the scattering of the beam particle by the system.

Actually Eq. (21) has the ideal structure for our purpose since it is already lin-
ear in ∂
∂z . So one can readily rearrange the terms in it to get the desired form of
Eq. (7). However, it is diﬃcult to work directly with such an equation since there
are problems associated with the interpretation of the results using the traditional
Schr¨odinger position operator [16]. In the standard theory the Foldy-Wouthuysen
(FW) transformation technique is used to reduce the Dirac Hamiltonian to a form
suitable for direct interpretation in terms of the nonrelativistic part and a series of
relativistic corrections. Derbenev and Kondratenko (DK) [17] used the FW tech-
nique to get their Hamiltonian for radiation calculations. Heinemann and Barber [18]
have reviewed the derivation of the DK Hamiltonian and have used it to suggest
a quantum formulation of Dirac particle beam physics, particularly for polarized
beams, in terms of machine coordinates, observables, and the Wigner function.

In an independent and diﬀerent approach an FW-like technique has been used
to develop a systematic formalism of Dirac particle beam optics in which the aim
has been to expand the Dirac Hamiltonian as a series of paraxial and nonparaxial
approximations [8, 9, 10, 19, 20]. This leads to the reduction of the original 4-
component Dirac spinor to an eﬀective 2-component ψ(r⊥; z) which satisﬁes the
accelerator optical Schr¨odinger equation [20]

where ˆH is a 2 × 2 matrix operator incorporating the Stern-Gerlach (SG) spin-orbit
eﬀect and the Thomas-Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi (TBMT) spin evolution. As is
usual in accelerator theory the spin operator S = 1
2¯hσ entering the accelerator op-
tical Hamiltonian ˆH refers to the rest frame of the moving particle. Further, (ˆx, ˆy)
and (ˆpx, ˆpy) in ˆH correspond to the observed particle position and momentum com-
ponents in the transverse plane. It should be noted that the 2-component ψ(r⊥; z) of
Eq. (22) is an accelerator optical approximation of the original 4-component Dirac
spinor, valid for any value of the design momentum p0 from nonrelativistic to ex-
treme relativistic region.

SG kicks in the transverse phase-space and the TBMT spin evolution. As in the
Klein-Gordon case of Eq. (18), ˆH of Eq. (23) also contains all the terms derivable
from the classical theory plus the quantum correction terms. But, it must be noted
that the scalar quantum correction term in Eq. (23)) (4th term) is not the same
as the 4th term in Eq. (18). Thus, besides in the ¯h-dependent eﬀects of spin on
the orbital quantum map (e.g., the last term in Eq. (23)), even in the ¯h-dependent
scalar quantum corrections the Dirac particle has its own signature diﬀerent from
that of the Klein-Gordon particle.

5 Conclusion

The problem of obtaining the quantum maps for phase-space transfer across particle
beam optical systems has been reviewed. The leading quantum corrections to the
classical maps are mainly due to the initial uncertainties and involve the Planck
constant ¯h not explicitly but only through the minimum limits set by the uncer-
tainty principle. These corrections can be obtained by direct quantization of the
Lie algebraic formalism of classical particle beam optics. The Klein-Gordon and
Dirac theories add further subtle, ¯h-dependent, corrections which may become ef-
fective when there are large ﬂuctuations in the initial uncertainties. Contrary to the
common expectation the scalar approximation of the Dirac theory is not completely
equivalent to the Klein-Gordon theory. All aspects of quantum maps for spin- 1
2
particle beams, including spin evolution and spin-orbit eﬀects, can be studied, at
the level of single particle dynamics, using the proper formalism based on the Dirac
equation.

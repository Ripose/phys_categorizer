Abstract

We have developed an eﬃcacious algorithm for simulation of the beam-beam in-
teraction in synchrotron colliders based on the nonlinear δf method, where δf
is the much smaller deviation of the beam distribution from the slowly evolving
main distribution f0. In the presence of damping and quantum ﬂuctuations of
synchrotron radiation it has been shown that the slowly evolving part of the
distribution function satisﬁes a Fokker-Planck equation. Its solution has been
obtained in terms of a beam envelope function and an amplitude of the dis-
tribution, which satisfy a coupled system of ordinary diﬀerential equations. A
numerical algorithm suited for direct code implementation of the evolving dis-
tributions for both δf and f0 has been developed. Explicit expressions for the
dynamical weights of macro-particles for δf as well as an expression for the slowly
changing f0 have been obtained.

1 Introduction

The eﬀects of the beam-beam interaction on particle dynamics in a synchrotron collider are
the key element that determines the performance of the collider such as luminosity [1] - [3].
In order to accurately understand these eﬀects, it is necessary to incorporate not only the
overall collisional eﬀects of the beam-beam interaction, but also the collective interaction
among individual parts of the beam in each beam and its feedback on the beam distribution.
The particle-in-cell (PIC) approach [4], [5] has been adopted to address such a study need
[6], [7], [8].

Particle-in-cell codes typically use macro-particles to represent the entire distribution
of particles.
In the beam-beam interaction for the PEP-II [9] (for example), the beams
consist of 1010 particles each. Simulating this many particles with the PIC technique is
computationally prohibitive. With the conventional PIC code 1010 particles are represented
by only 103 − 104 macro-particles allowing simulation of the beam-beam interaction in a
reasonable computation time. However, the statistical ﬂuctuation level of various quantities
such as the beam density ρ in the code is much higher than that of the real beam. The
ﬂuctuation level δρ goes as approximately

√N
N

,

δρ
ρ ≈

(1.1)

where N is the number of particles. Therefore, the ﬂuctuation level of the PIC code is about
103 times higher than that of the real beam. Although this probability is not signiﬁcant for
beam blowup near resonances, the higher ﬂuctuation level has a large eﬀect on more subtle
phenomenon such as particle diﬀusion. The purpose of the δf algorithm is to facilitate the
study of subtle eﬀects and has been introduced in [10], [11], [12].

The δf method follows only the ﬂuctuating part of the distribution instead of the entire
distribution. This is essentially modeling the numerator of the right-hand side of equation

(1.1). So the 103 − 104 macro particles are used to represent √1010 or 105 real ﬂuctuation

particles in PEP-II beams. This is only one or two orders of magnitude beyond the number
of macro particles. Such a modest gap between the number of macro particles and the real
ﬂuctuating particles maybe ameliorated by the standard techniques of the PIC approach,
such as the method of ﬁnite-sized macro-particles [4], [5].

PIC strong-strong codes use a ﬁnite number of particles to represent the Klimontovich

(1.2)

(1.3)

The electric ﬁeld Ex(x) is calculated from the distribution of the particles of the on-coming
beam and δp(s) is the periodic δ-function with a periodicity of the accelerator circumference.
The distribution function f (x, p; s) is represented by a ﬁnite number of macro-particles by

f (x, p; s) =

1
N

NXn=1

δ(x − xn(s))δ(p − pn(s)),

(1.4)

where N is the number of macro-particles.

The strategy of the δf method is that only the perturbative part of the distribution is

followed. The total distribution function f (x, p; s) is decomposed into

f (x, p; s) = f0(x, p; s) + δf (x, p; s),

(1.5)

where f0(x, p; s) is the steady or slowly varying part of the distribution and δf (x, p; s) is the
perturbative part. The key to this method is ﬁnding a distribution f0(x, p; s) which is close
to the total distribution f (x, p; s). The perturbative part δf (x, p; s) is then small, causes
only small changes to the distribution, and thus represents only the ﬂuctuation levels. If
a distribution f0(x, p; s) close to the total distribution is not found or found poorly, then
δf (x, p; s) represents more than the ﬂuctuation part of the total distribution; defeating the
purpose of the method. The ideal situation is having an analytic solution for f0(x, p; s). In
this case any numerical truncation errors which result from the necessary derivatives of this
function are eliminated. If an analytic solution cannot be found, then a numerical solution
needs to be found which is close to the total distribution f (x, p; s) and is slowly varying.
A frequent numerical update of f0(x, p; s) would also defeat the purpose of the δf method,
since the PIC technique essentially does this also.

The beam-beam interaction can lead to beam instabilities that disrupt or severely distort
the beam or gradual beam spreading. The higher the beam current, and thus the beam-
beam interaction, the stronger these eﬀects become. Therefore, when one wants to maximize
the luminosity of a collider, one needs to confront the beam-beam interaction eﬀects. The
operation of PEP-II, for example, is critically dependent on the beam-beam interaction and
optimal parameters to minimize the related beam instabilities are under intense study.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next Section we present a brief formulation of
the problem of beam-beam interaction in synchrotron colliders. In Section 3 we develop the
nonlinear δf method for solving the equation for the microscopic phase space density in the
presence of random external forces. The equation for the ﬂuctuating part δf is being derived
and its solution is found explicitly in terms of dynamical weight functions, prescribed to each
macro-particle. In Section 4 we solve the Fokker-Planck equation for the averaged slowly
evolving part of the distribution. We show that the solution is an exponential of a bilinear
form in coordinates and momenta with coeﬃcients that can be regarded as generalized
Courant-Snyder parameters. In Section 5 we outline numerical algorithms to alternatively
solve the Fokker-Planck equation and the macro particle distribution with dynamical weight.
Finally, Section 6 is dedicated to our summary and conclusions.

2 Description of the beam-Beam Interaction

In order to describe the beam dynamics in an electron positron storage ring, we introduce
the equations of motion in the following manner. The beam propagation in a reference frame
attached to the particle orbit is usually described in terms of the canonical conjugate pairs

where u = (x, z), s is the path length along the particle orbit, and the index k refers to
either beam (k = 1, 2). In equations (2.1) and (2.2) the quantity u(k) is the actual particle
displacement from the reference orbit in the plane transversal to the orbit, p(k)
is the actual
u
particle momentum, and E(k) is the particle energy. Furthermore, p(k)
0 and Ek0 are the total
momentum and energy of the synchronous particle, respectively, and D(k)
is the well-known
dispersion function. The quantity

u

(2.3)

is the longitudinal coordinate of a particle from the k-th beam with respect to the syn-
chronous particle, where ω(k)

(3.2)

split the MPSD fk into two parts according to the relation:

where nx(k)

It is worthwhile to note here that the representation (3.3) is unique, embedding the basic
idea of the δf method. However, one is completely free to ﬁx the f0 part, which usually
describes those features of the evolution of the system one can solve easily (and preferably in
explicit form). In the next Section we show that fk0, averaged over the statistical realizations
of the process ξk(s) satisﬁes a Fokker-Planck equation and ﬁnd its solution.

Subtract now the two equations (3.2) and (3.4) to obtain an equation for the δfk

The next step consists in deﬁning the weight function that is relative to the total distribution
as

Substituting

Equation (3.9) can be solved formally by the method of characteristics. The ﬁrst couple
of equations for the characteristics are precisely the equations of motion (2.18) and (2.19).

4 The Fokker-Planck Equation

To derive the desired equation let us deﬁne the distribution function Fk0(x, p; s) and the
ﬂuctuation δfk0(x, p; s) according to the relations:

Fk0(x, p; s) = hfk0(x, p; s)i

;

δfk0(x, p; s) = fk0(x, p; s) − Fk0(x, p; s),

(4.1)

where h· · ·i implies statistical average. Neglecting second order terms and correlators in δfk0
and δf(3−k)0 that generally give rise to collision integrals, we write down the equations for

In order to carry out the δf method eﬀectively, it is important to ﬁnd an equilibrium
solution of f0 (or very slowly varying solution) so that the evolution of δf is separate in time
scale from that of f0. In the following we discuss the equation and the solution of the f0
distribution.

For the sake of simplicity, in what follows bellow in this Section, we consider one dimen-

It is important to note that when the damping vanishes (Γk = 0) the above equations are
exactly the same as the well-known diﬀerential equations for the Courant-Snyder parameters.

In this sense the functions eαk, eβk and eγk can be regarded as a generalization of the Courant-

Snyder parameters in the case when radiation damping and quantum excitation are present.

Manipulating equations (4.11), (4.12) and (4.13) for the generalized Courant-Snyder param-

eters one can eliminate eαk and eγk and obtain a single equation for the envelope σk, which

combined with equation (4.10) comprises a complete set:

By solving equations (4.20) and (4.21) one can obtain a complete information about the
evolution of the Fk0 part of the distribution function. However, solving the above system
of equations for the beam envelopes and amplitudes of the distributions is not an easy task.
For that purpose we develop in the next Section a numerical scheme which is more suited
for direct code implementation.

5 Numerical Algorithm

In the previous Sections, we have established the theoretical foundation of the nonlinear δf
method for the beam-beam interaction. In this Section we will apply those results to outline
numerical algorithms suitable for computer simulation.

Starting with Eq. (3.4), because the forces in the equation both from lattice and the
on-coming beam are linear, its solution is well known Gaussian distribution (for example as
shown in the previous Section in the one-dimensional case)

dimensional phase space. Based on the method of the beam-envelope [14], the propagation

where bΣk is the matrix of the second moments for the distribution and z is a vector in the six-
of Fk0 can be represented as the iteration of the bΣk matrix,
k +cDk,
where cMk is the one-turn matrix including the linear beam-beam force of the on-coming
beam, and the radiation damping and cDk is the one-turn quantum diﬀusion matrix. Both
cMk and cDk can be extracted from the lattice using for example the LEGO code [15], [16].
map cMk depends on the beam size of the other beam.

However, there is a diﬀerence compared to the situation of a single storage ring, namely,
we have to simultaneously iterate the Gaussian distribution for both beams, since the linear

(s) is the dynamical weight of the n-th particle from the k-th beam.

As a part of the solution for Eq. (3.9), the propagation of the particle coordinates in
phase space is the same as the conventional PIC code [8] provided that the beam-beam force
is the sum of the two parts from both Fk0 and δfk.

12

For the Fk0 part, we can apply the well known Erskine-Bassetti formula [17] for a Gaus-
sian beam. The force due to the δfk is obtained by solving the two-dimensional Poisson
equation. In addition to the change of the coordinate, the weight of the particle should be
propagated according to Eq. (3.11). The weight should be updated after the change of the
coordinate since the change of the weight depends on the trajectory of the particle.

Summary

We have developed an eﬃcacious algorithm for simulating the beam-beam interaction in a
synchrotron collider with (or without) synchrotron radiation. The nonlinear δf method has
been introduced into the evolutionary description of subtle changes of the counter stream-
ing distribution of the colliding beams over many revolutions. The overall equation that
describes this evolution is the Fokker-Planck equation (with the radiative process and quan-
tum ﬂuctuations). In order to isolate the δf distribution from the average distribution, we
analyze the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation. Obtained is a form of solution in which
the time dependence is parameterized through a slow evolution (slow compared with the
changes in the δf distribution due to the individual beam-beam interaction) in the Courant-
Snyder parameters and the emittance of the beam. This algorithm will enhance the analysis
capability to scrutinize greater details and subtle eﬀects in the beam-beam interaction than
the PIC version which has been widely deployed [8].

The current algorithm as well as the previous one [8] have been developed with an
immediate application to the PEP-II B-factory collider. The code [8] has already been
applied to describe the beam-beam interaction in the PEP-II with unprecedented accuracy
and reproduction faithfulness, and will be suﬃcient to study the overall dynamics such as
the analysis of resonance instabilities and associated luminosity functions. It is anticipated,
however, that the numerical noise associated with the PIC will require either an inordinate
amount of macro-particle deployment or a level of noise high enough to mask some minute
phase space structure that may manifest in subtle but important long-time evolution of the
beam such as particle diﬀusion.
It is here that the current algorithm will cope with the
problem.

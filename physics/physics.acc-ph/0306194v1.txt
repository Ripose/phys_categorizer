INTRODUCTION

The coupled-bunch beam breakup (bbu) problem in a
periodic linac excited by the resonance wake is well un-
derstood [1, 2, 3]. However, there are no systematic stud-
ies for the corresponding problem excited by the resistive
wall impedance. This study of the resistive wall bbu
problem is necessitated by the recently proposed PERL
project [4]. For PERL, the light source consists of twelve
undulators, each twelve meters long, totally 144 meters.
The beam is shielded from the environment by circular
copper pipes of a very small radius b=2.5 mm. The pro-
posed injection cycle is twelve hours. It is crucial to know
if the PERL beam can survive the bbu. We present our
theoretical results for the resistive-wall coupled-bunch
beam breakup problem in this paper. Some of the re-
sults obtained here has been brieﬂy reported in Ref. [5].

The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we set
up the equations of motion and then solve the related
eigenvalue problem. Physically, the eigenfunction so ob-
tained describe the beam coherent-oscillation of an “ex-
tended problem”. In Sec. III, we give a formal solution
for the initial value problem. The solution consists of an
integral representation for the transverse position of the
M -th bunch at a longitudinal position z in terms of the
eigenfunctions obtained in the previous section [6]. The
asymptotic limit, M
, of the transient solution is
then obtained in Sec. IV for two extreme cases: the No
Focusing (NF) case and the Strong Focusing (SF) case.
V, we treat the case where only one

has periodically unﬁlled gaps. The results of the section
V is compared to the results of the preceding sections.
The conclusion we draw from the comparison is that the
asymptotic resistive-wall coupled-bunch bbu is a locally
averaged current problem. In Section VI we go back to
the problem where each bucket is symmetrically ﬁlled.
The diﬀerence between this section and the section IV is
that here we treat the case where initially the transverse
position of every bunch is oﬀset by the same amount –
injection error. By comparing the results of Section VI
with those of Section IV, we observe “Screen Eﬀects” for
the injection error case.

II. EQUATION OF MOTION AND THE
EIGENVALUE PROBLEM

An electron bunch train consisting of a series of iden-
tical point like bunches passes through a circularly cylin-
drical pipe of radius b and conductivity σ. The entrance
to the pipe is located at z = 0, and the M -th bunch,
M = 0, 1, 2..., moves in the z direction according to
z = c t
M c τB, where τB is the bunch separation in
units of seconds. Inside the pipe, the equation of motion
for a particle in the bunch M is

Also notice that the bunch N is in front of the bunch M

In writing the above equations, we assumed the linac to
be uniformly ﬁlled. For such a case, the locally averaged
current Iaverage = IB. For the case of non-uniform ﬁlling,
an example of that will be discussed in Section V, the
equation (1) has to be modiﬁed.

The right hand side of Eq. (1) is a convolution sum,
therefore, it can be diagonalized by a Fourier transform.

The last equation is an eigenvalue equation, with the
parameter θ playing the role of distinguishing diﬀerent
eigenvalues. For the coherent mode θ, we see from Eq.
(5) that the parameter θ is the phase diﬀerence of the ad-
jacent bunches in this mode. Recall that in a storage ring,
a symmetric coupling bunch mode n is characterized by
the Courant-Sessler phase factor exp(i 2 π n/h) [8], where
h is the number of the bunches in the ring. We can think
of the phase exp(iθ) as the limit of the Courant-Sessler
factor as both n and h
while n/h = θ remains

through Eq. (7), ξ(θ, z) also has a singular point at the
same position. Since Eq. (6) is the inverse of Eq. (5)
and we look for yM with M > 0, causality requires this
singularity to lie below the contour of Eq. (6) on the θ
plane. In order to explain this point more clearly, let us
introduce

When expressing a function of θ, for example the func-
tion F (θ), in terms of ζ, we write F (ζ) = F (θ) above
instead of creating a new symbol; this should not intro-
duce any unnecessary confusion. We adopt this conven-
tion throughout this paper. The singularity of F (θ) at
θ = 0, corresponds to a singularity of F (ζ) at ζ = 1. The
singular part of F (ζ) is

Equation (13) is a power series expansion of the func-
tion ξ in the variable ζ. The radius of the convergence
circle of this series is 1, since the closest singularity of ξ
is at ζ = 1, i.e., at θ = 0. From the residue theorem, Eq.
(14) is clearly the inverse of Eq. (13) provided that the
integration contour lies inside of the convergence circle,
and the contour encircle the origin ζ = 0 counterclock-
wise. It is convenient to take the contour to be the unit
circle and the singularity to be located at ζ = 1 + ǫ with
a small and positive ǫ. On the ζ-plane, we make a cut on
, and make all the
the real axis from ζ = 1 + ǫ to ζ =
following calculation on the ﬁrst sheet of the Riemann
surface. Expressed in the θ variable in Eq. (6), the sin-
gularity is at θ =
i log(1 + ǫ), i.e., below the contour
of Eq. (6). The cut on the θ-plane is at the lower-half of
the imaginary axis, i.e., θ from

iǫ to

The results of this section have been applied to the
parameters of PERL in Ref [5]. The conclusion of that
study is that the PERL beam as designed can not survive
the resistive wall bbu without feedback dampers.

V. BEAM WITH PERIODIC GAPS

The bunch ﬁlling pattern considered in this section is
as follows: The beam is made of repetitive identical se-
quences where each sequence consists of p adjacent ﬁlled
buckets followed by q empty buckets; there are in total
r = p + q buckets in a sequence.

where, S(M ) is the wake function given in Section II;
S(M ) = 0 for M
N for
M > 0. The parameter a is given by Eq. (3). Note that
we have made here a slight change of convention. We
designated the bunches as M = 1, 2, 3, ... above instead
of M = 0, 1, 2, ... as was done in Section II. We adopt
this new convention throughout this section.

N ) = a/√M

We have to generalize the above equation to include
the case of a beam with periodic empty buckets. Let us
use the notation u = 1, 2, 3... for the sequence number,
and m = 1, 2....p for the bunch number in a sequence. It
is convenient to deﬁne, corresponding to each u a p
p
matrix S(u) with its elements given by
m,n = S(u)
S(u)

m−n = S[ur + (m
where the range of u for S(u) is u = 0, 1, 2, ....... Corre-
sponding to the above matrix, we deﬁne 1

The equation of motion for a beam with periodic gaps
can now be written in a compact form similar to Eq. (1),

Observe the similarity of Eqs. (62) and (60) above to
the following equations we obtained earlier for the uni-
form ﬁlling case, (Eqs. (25) and (14),)

The variable m appears as a passive parameter in Eqs.
(62) and (60). Also, these equations can be obtained
from Eqs. (63) and (64) by the following substitutions:

Therefore, we can obtain the results for Eqs. (62) and
(60) from the corresponding results for the uniform ﬁlling
case. We treat here the “No Focusing ” case correspond-
ing to the subsection IV-A. We speciﬁcally consider the
growth time tgap
NF for the beam with periodic gaps. The
“Strong Focusing ” case can be treated in a similar way.
M as given by (36).
Expressing α1 in terms of a, this equation is equivalent
to

We start from the exponent Ψ(−)

= 5π1/5(M + 1)1/5(z/4)4/5a2/5 .

INJECTION ERROR AND SCREEN

EFFECT

In this section, we study Eq. (17) for the case where
bbu is started up by an injection error,
i.e., all the
bunches are initially oﬀset by the same amount, yM0 =
y00, and y′

0. Then, Eq. (17) becomes

(83)

The last equation is identical to Eq. (32), and therefore
this yields the same ﬁrst-order solution given in Eq. (34).
We select now the relevant saddle points by repeating
what we did before following Eq. (34), and then carry out
the saddle point integral corresponding to the exponent
(78). The result is

Compared with Eq. (23), Eq. (76) has an additional term

that this term does not change the eigen solutions as
given in Secs II
V, but it will change the transient
solutions. We shall also see that this term leads to an
interesting “Screen Eﬀect”. From kc(0) = ky, Eq. (75)

Let us discuss as before two extreme cases: the No Fo-
cusing case and the Strong Focusing case.

A. No Focusing (NF) case

out the saddle point analysis to the integral (22) with the

It is very interesting to compare with the above result
(84) to the result (42) of the initial single-bunch oﬀset
case.
(1) The growth time tNF is the same for both
cases, as it should be, since tNF should depends only
on the eigen solutions. (2) The only diﬀerence between
the transient solutions is the factor
GNF which is propor-
tional to M 4/5 instead of to M , (recall that t
M .) This
∝
is surprising: Since θsaddle ∼= 0, we would expect all the
bunches preceding the bunch M to excite this bunch by
the same amount leading to
M . Clearly, the pre-
ceding bunches are screening each other. (It can actually
be shown that for large but not too large M , the function
GNF ∝

GNF ∝

M .)

B. Strong Focusing (SF) case

Let us not go into detailed discussion of this case, since
the arguments are so similar to those of Section IV and
Section VI-A. We just list the results:

Synchro-Betatron Stop-Bands due to a Single Crab Cavity

We analyze the stop-band due to crab cavities for horizontal tunes that are either close to integers
or close to half integers. The latter case is relevant for today’s electron/positron colliders. We
compare this stop-band to that created by dispersion in an accelerating cavity and show that a
single typical crab cavity creates larger stop-bands than a typical dispersion at an accelerating
cavity.

We furthermore analyze whether it is beneﬁcial to place the crab cavity at a position where the
dispersion and its slope vanish. We ﬁnd that this choice is worth while if the horizontal tune is close
to a half integer, but not if it is close to an integer. Furthermore we ﬁnd that stop-bands can be
avoided when the horizontal tune is located at a favorable side of the integer or the half integer.

While we are here concerned with the installation of a single crab cavity in a storage ring, we
show that the stop-bands can be weakened, although not eliminated, signiﬁcantly when two crab
cavities per ring are chosen suitably.

INTRODUCTION

φkc from the accelerating to the crab cavity [8],

A crossing angle at the interaction region (IR) of collid-
ing beam accelerators introduces synchro-beta responses
[1, 2]. This is due to the fact that the beam-beam focus-
ing is diﬀerent for particles at diﬀerent positions along the
bunch, so that the horizontal beam-beam force is mod-
ulated by synchrotron oscillations of the particles. Crab
cavities have been envisioned to eliminate this source
so coupling for linear colliders [3] and circular colliders
[4]. While construction work started in early work on
B-factories [5] it is now planned to use crab cavities for
the ﬁrst time in KEK-B, in order to have bunches col-
lide head on in IRs with crossing angle [6]. While this
eliminates the synchro-beta resonances due to the beam-
beam kick if the hourglass eﬀect is negligible [7], it re-
quires transverse kicks in the crab cavities that depend
on the longitudinal bunch position and therefore, even in
absence of beam-beam interaction, crab cavities them-
selves introduce synchro-beta resonances. Furthermore
it has been suggested that crab cavities could be used in
the damping rings of a linear collider.

Consider a storage ring that has an accelerating cavity
and a crab cavity. The transport matrix T kc from the
accelerating cavity to the crab cavity for the phase space
coordinates x, x′, τ and δ is given by the Twiss param-
eters at both places and by the betatron phase advance

pling can then move two eigenvalues λ toward each other.
When two eigenvalues become close, they can move away
from the unit circle of

the synchrotron phase advance µs is close to 0, this con-
dition becomes relevant when the horizontal tune ν = µ

The second condition (B) becomes relevant when the
horizontal tune is close to an integer or a half integer.
The coupling can then move λ to real values.

In the following we compute conditions (A) and (B)

A) No crab cavity but with dispersion at the acceler-

ating cavity, i.e. ξ = 0 and ~ηc

= ~0.

B) No dispersion at the crab cavity and at the accel-

erating cavity, i.e. ξ

= 0, ~ηk = ~0 and ~ηc = ~0.

C) Dispersion at the crab cavity but no dispersion at

~ηc = ~0.

Case B is a special case of case C.

We will evaluate the stop-bands that occur close to in-
teger and half-integer values of the horizontal tune ν due
to condition (A) and (B) respectively. As an example we
will use the parameters of Tab. I unless speciﬁed other-
wise. Typically the crab cavity strength is given by the
half crossing angle φ at the interaction point via

II. HORIZONTAL TUNE CLOSE TO INTEGERS

Condition (A) is relevant when the horizontal phase
advance is close to a given synchrotron phase advance

leads to a stop-band for the horizontal tune ν = µ
2π close
to every integer. The boundary of stability is found by
solving

One additionally has to check whether condition (B) is
satisﬁed in the regions which are declared as stable. For
the parameters chosen here, this is the case.

transition is negative. However, all subsequent formulas
depend on cos µs only so that the sign of the synchrotron
tune does not matter.

C. Dispersion at a crab cavity

If the dispersion in the crab cavity is not matched to a
small value, it will typically be as large as several meters.
Since this is not a small perturbation, we only linearize
in ξ and in δµ.

It is interesting that no real stop-band width exists
when sin µ is negative, and the stop-band only occurs
above integer horizontal tunes. Higher order terms of
the stop-band width expansion depend on the time of
ﬂight term r56, αk and η′
k.

Now we can evaluate whether dispersion at the crab
cavity has a negative inﬂuence on the stop-band width.
Since there is only a stop-band for sin µ > 0, it turns out
that in Eq. (28) a dispersion at the crab cavity reduces

Figure 3 (bottom) shows the unstable region bor-
dered by a light green curve for the optimal value of
sin µ = 14.32m. The approximate Eq. (28)
ηk =
indicated by the dark red curve evaluates to zero stop-
band width for this dispersion. In fact, the stop-band is
extremely narrow but due to higher order terms it does
not have zero width. But Fig. 3 (top) for ηk = 11m
shows that the approximation works quite reliably for
non-optimal dispersions.

The other parameters were chosen as speciﬁed in
Tab. I. It is evident that the dispersion reduces the width

6
of the stop-band greatly, and it could be recommended to
use the dispersion at the crab cavity to reduce the stop-
band width. However, the B-factories at SLAC and KEK
as well as other e+/e− colliders like CESR have horizon-
tal tunes which are close to a half integer and therefore
the subsequent section about stop-bands at half-integer
tunes is more relevant for these applications.

III. HORIZONTAL TUNE CLOSE TO HALF
INTEGERS

When using condition (A) for determining stability,
one additionally has to check whether condition (B) is
satisﬁed in the regions which are declared stable by con-
dition (A). For the parameters of the examples shown
above, this is the case. When, as in the case of the B-
factories or other e+/e− colliders the horizontal tune is
close to a half integer, whereas the synchrotron tune is
small, the coupling strength will not bring two eigenval-
ues λ together. It can however happen that one of the
eigenvalues becomes real, and it is here that condition
(B) becomes important.
In the following examples we
therefore use ν = 8.49 or ν = 8.51.

The borders of stability are found by solving

for µs.

Using the coeﬃcients aA

For small dispersion at the cavity one obtains cos µs

so that there is no unstable region close to half-integer
tunes due to dispersion at an accelerating cavity.

that the range of νs is reduced by a factor of 10 from
compared to other graphs. Here the forbidden region is
up to 0.01 in tune space. This is currently not critical
for the B-factories but could in the future restrict the
possibilities of moving the horizontal tune even closer to
the half integer in B-factories.

Equation (33) indicates that for tunes where there is
a stop-band in the case of ηk = 0, i.e. for ν above a half
integer where cot µ
2 < 0, the stop-band becomes wider by
introducing dispersion at the crab cavity. Furthermore,
there is now also a stop-band at tunes below a half integer
where cot µ

2 > 0 when the dispersion is large enough.

It is even clearer when investigating the
unstable region for a tune of ν = 8.49 in Fig. 6. For
ηk = 0 (left) there is no stop-band while for ηk = 4m
(right) the stop-band is substantial.

The border of stability has two sections, one is well
approximated by Eq. (33) and one is not. The former
one comes from condition (B−) on which Eq. (33) is based
and the latter one comes from condition (B+).

The strength of this eﬀect is nicely seen for a disper-
sion of only ηk = 1m when plotting the stop-band of
the horizontal tune ν for a ﬁxed synchrotron tune of
νs = µs
2π = 0.1 in Fig. 7. For ηk = 0 (top) the stop-
band is located only on one side of the half integer. For
ηk = 1m (bottom) the νs stop-band is not only much
wider, it also extends to both sides of the half integer.

IV. A PAIR OF CRAB CAVITIES

While we here want to restrict ourselves to the pro-
posed insertion of one crab cavity in a ring, it should be
pointed out that a pair of crab cavities can strongly re-
duce the width of the stop-bands when the two crab cav-
ities have betatron phases which diﬀer by odd multiples

of π. While this would cancel the ﬁrst order synchro-
beta coupling of the crab cavity exactly when the time of
ﬂight term m56 between them vanishes, the beam-beam
focusing at the interaction point will spoil this exact can-
cellation to some extent.

It can be shown that, when a beam-beam focusing is
included at the IP, the eﬀect can be represented as a
single kick at the entrance crab cavity by a matrix

where ∆ν is the beam-beam tune shift parameter, and
m56 = 0 was assumed for the transport matrix between
the cavities. Furthermore we assumed ~ηk = ~0 and αk =
0. As it should, when ∆ν = 0, the two crab cavities
have perfect cancellation and this matrix becomes a unit
matrix.

The analysis can now be repeated with this new matrix

shown in Fig. 8 for ∆ν = 0.05. Note that the stop-band
is narrower and that the unstable valley is shallower than
in the corresponding Fig. 2.

This diﬀers from the corresponding Eq.(32) approxi-

δµ . An example for ν = 8.51

is given in Fig. 9. For the example of ∆ν = 0.05 and
δν = 0.01, the valley of instability is wider and deeper
than in the corresponding Fig. 4.

become larger than 0.05 in high luminosity operations.
Again, the resonance only appears above the integer.

When the tune is close to a half integer, the border of

pair. When one crab cavity is to be installed in a storage
ring, the dispersion at the crab cavity can be non-zero
or can even be used to reduce synchro-beta stop-bands.
When the tune is close to a half integer, the dispersion
should be matched to a small value at the crab cavity
however. In both cases it should be noted that the stop-
band due to synchro-beta coupling is larger than that due
to a large dispersion at an accelerating cavity. This ef-
fect can be reduced when two crab cavities are used. The
advantage is limited, however, when the ring is operated
with a large beam-beam tune shift.

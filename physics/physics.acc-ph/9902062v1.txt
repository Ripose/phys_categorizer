Abstract. In this paper we present applications of methods from wavelet analysis to
polynomial approximations for a number of accelerator physics problems. According
to a variational approach in the general case we have the solution as a multiresolution
(multiscales) expansion on the base of compactly supported wavelet basis. We give an
extension of our results to the cases of periodic orbital particle motion and arbitrary
variable coeﬃcients. Then we consider more ﬂexible variational method which is based
on a biorthogonal wavelet approach. Also we consider a diﬀerent variational approach,
which is applied to each scale.

I

INTRODUCTION

This is the ﬁrst part of our two-part presentation in which we consider applica-
tions of methods from wavelet analysis to nonlinear accelerator physics problems.
This is a continuation of results from [1]-[6], which is based on our approach to
investigation of nonlinear problems – general, with additional structures (Hamil-
tonian, symplectic or quasicomplex), chaotic, quasiclassical, quantum, which are
considered in the framework of local (nonlinear) Fourier analysis, or wavelet anal-
ysis. Wavelet analysis is a relatively novel set of mathematical methods, which
gives us the possibility of working with well-localized bases in functional spaces
and with the general type of operators (diﬀerential, integral, pseudodiﬀerential) in
such bases.

We consider the application of multiresolution representation to a general non-
linear dynamical system with the polynomial type of nonlinearities. In part II we

consider this very useful approximation in the cases of orbital motion in a storage
ring, a particle in the multipolar ﬁeld, eﬀects of insertion devices on beam dynam-
ics, and spin orbital motion. Starting in part III A from variational formulation of
initial dynamical problem we construct via multiresolution analysis (part III B) ex-
plicit representation for all dynamical variables in the base of compactly supported
(Daubechies) wavelets. Our solutions (part III C) are parametrized by solutions
of a number of reduced algebraical problems, one of which is nonlinear with the
same degree of nonlinearity, and the rest are the linear problems which correspond
to a particular method of calculation of scalar products of functions from wavelet
bases and their derivatives. Then we consider the further extension of our previous
In part V we consider modiﬁcation of our construction to the periodic
results.
case; in part VI we consider generalization of our approach to variational formu-
lation in the biorthogonal bases of compactly supported wavelets, and in part VII
to the case of variable coeﬃcients. In part IV we consider the diﬀerent variational
approach which is based on ideas of para-products (A) and approximation for a
multiresolution approach, which gives us the possibility for computations in each
scale separately (B).

II PROBLEMS AND APPROXIMATIONS

We consider below a number of examples of nonlinear accelerator physics prob-
lems which are from the formal mathematical point of view not more than nonlinear
diﬀerential equations with polynomial nonlinearities and variable coeﬃcients.

A Orbital Motion in Storage Rings

We consider as the main example the particle motion in storage rings in a stan-
dard approach, which is based on consideration of [7]. Starting from Hamiltonian,
which described classical dynamics in storage rings,

and the corresponding expansion of RHS of equations (4).
In the following we
take into account only arbitrary polynomial (in terms of dynamical variables) ex-
pressions and neglect all nonpolynomial types of expressions; i.e. we consider such
approximations of RHS which are not more than polynomial functions in dynami-
cal variables and arbitrary functions of independent variable s (”time” in our case,
if we consider our system of equations as a dynamical problem).

correspond to regular and skew multipoles. The cases n = 2 to n = 5 correspond
to low-order multipoles: quadrupole, sextupole, octupole, decapole.

Then we have, in this particular case, the following equations of motion for a
single particle in a circular magnetic lattice in the transverse plane (x, y) ([8] for

Then we may take into account arbitrary but ﬁnite number in expansion of RHS
of Hamiltonian (9) and from our point of view the corresponding Hamiltonian
equations of motion are also not more than nonlinear ordinary diﬀerential equations
with polynomial nonlinearities and variable coeﬃcients.

C Eﬀects of Insertion Devices on Beam Dynamics

Assuming a sinusoidal ﬁeld variation, we may consider, according to [9], the an-
alytical treatment of the eﬀects of insertion devices on beam dynamics. One of the
major detrimental aspects of the installation of insertion devices is the resulting
reduction of dynamic aperture. Introduction of non-linearities leads to enhance-
ment of the amplitude-dependent tune shifts and distortion of phase space. The
nonlinear ﬁelds will produce signiﬁcant eﬀects at large betatron amplitudes.

The components of the insertion device magnetic ﬁeld used for the derivation of

equations of motion are as follows:

Bx =

B0 sinh(kxx) sinh(kyy) cos(kz)

By = B0 cosh(kxx) cosh(kyy) cos(kz)

(10)

Bz =

B0 cosh(kxx) sinh(kyy) sin(kz),

x+k2

with k2
y = k2 = (2π/λ)2, where λ is the period length of the insertion device, B0
its magnetic ﬁeld, and ρ the radius of the curvature in the ﬁeld B0. After a canonical
transformation to change to betatron variables, the Hamiltonian is averaged over
the period of the insertion device, and hyperbolic functions are expanded to the
fourth order in x and y (or an arbitrary order).
Then we have the following Hamiltonian:

with variable (periodic) coeﬃcients. As a related case we may consider wiggler and

We will consider this dynamical system also in our second paper in this volume via
an invariant approach, based on consideration of Lie-Poison structures on semidi-
rect products of groups.

But from the point of view used in this paper we may consider approximations
similar to preceding examples and then also arrive to at some type of polynomial
dynamics.

III POLYNOMIAL DYNAMICS

The ﬁrst main part of our consideration is some variational approach to this
problem, which reduces the initial problem to the problem of solving functional
equations at the ﬁrst stage and some algebraical problems at the second stage. We
have the solution in a compactly supported wavelet basis. Multiresolution expan-
sion is the second main part of our construction. The solution is parameterized
by solutions of two reduced algebraical problems, one being nonlinear and the sec-
ond being some linear problem, which is obtained from one of the next wavelet
constructions: Fast Wavelet Transform (FWT), Stationary Subdivision Schemes
(SSS), the method of Connection Coeﬃcients (CC).

A Variational Method

Our problems may be formulated as the systems of ordinary diﬀerential equations

dxi/dt = fi(xj, t),

(i, j = 1, ..., n)

,

(20)

with ﬁxed initial conditions xi(0), where fi are not more than polynomial functions
of dynamical variables xj and have arbitrary dependence of time. Because of time
dilation we can consider only the next time interval: 0
1. Let us consider a
set of functions,

and a set of functionals

based on the possibility of taking into account underlying symplectic structure and
using a more useful and ﬂexible analytical approach, related to bilinear structure
of initial function.

Now we consider formal expansions for xi, yi:

xi(t) = xi(0) +

λk
i ϕk(t)

yj(t) =

ηr
j ϕr(t),

(24)

Xk

where, because of initial conditions, we need only ϕk(0) = 0. Then we have the
following reduced algebraical system of equations on the set of unknown coeﬃcients

Now, when we solve system (25) and determine unknown coeﬃcients from formal
expansion (24) we therefore obtain the solution of our initial problem. It should be
noted that, if we consider only the truncated expansion (24) with N terms, then we

have the solution of the initial nonlinear (polynomial) problem in the form

xi(t) = xi(0) +

λk
i Xk(t),

(27)

N

Xk=1

where coeﬃcients λk
i are roots of the corresponding reduced algebraical problem
(25). Consequently, we have a parametrization of the solution of the initial problem
by solution of the reduced algebraical problem (25). The ﬁrst main problem is a
problem of computations of coeﬃcients of the reduced algebraical system. As we
will see, these problems may be explicitly solved in the wavelet approach.

Next we consider the construction the of explicit time solution for our problem.
The obtained solutions are given in the form (27), where Xk(t) are the basis func-
tions and λi
k are roots of the reduced system of equations. In our ﬁrst wavelet case,
Xk(t) are obtained via multiresolution expansions and represented by compactly
supported wavelets, and λi
k are the roots of the corresponding general polynomial
system (25) with coeﬃcients, which are given by FWT, SSS or CC constructions.
According to the variational method giving the reduction from the diﬀerential to
the algebraical system of equations, we need to compute the objects γj
a and µji,
which are constructed from objects:

σi ≡ Z
νij ≡ Z
µji ≡ Z

(28)

for the simplest case of Riccati systems, where the degree of nonlinearity equals
two. For the general case of arbitrary n we have analogous to (28) iterated integrals
with the degree of monomials in integrand, which is one bigger than the degree of
the initial system.

B Wavelet Framework

Our constructions are based on a multi-resolution approach. Because aﬃne group
of translations and dilations are part of the approach, this method resembles the
action of a microscope. We have a contribution to the ﬁnal result from each scale
of resolution from the whole inﬁnite scale of spaces. More exactly, the closed

expansion, and it can be written solely in terms of translated scaling functions.
Also we have the shortest possible support: scaling function DN (where N is even
1] and N/2 vanishing moments. There exists
integer) will have support [0, N

(40). Solving these linear problems, we obtain the coeﬃcients of a nonlinear alge-
braical system (25), and after that we obtain the coeﬃcients of wavelet expansion
(27). As a result we obtained the explicit time solution of our problem in the base
of compactly supported wavelets. We use for modelling D6, D8, and D10 functions
and programs RADAU and DOPRI for testing.

In the following we consider the extension of this approach to the case of periodic
boundary conditions, the case of presence of arbitrary variable coeﬃcients and a
more ﬂexible biorthogonal wavelet approach.

IV EVALUATION OF NONLINEARITIES SCALE BY

SCALE

A Para-product and Decoupling between Scales

Before we consider two diﬀerent schemes of modiﬁcation of our variational ap-
proach we consider diﬀerent scales separately. For this reason we need to compute
errors of approximations. The main problems come of course from nonlinear terms.
We follow the approach from [12].

Let Pj be the projection operators on the subspaces Vj, j

In this formula there is no interaction between diﬀerent scales. We may consider
each term of (46) as bilinear mappings:

For numerical purposes we need formula (46) with a ﬁnite number of scales, but
when we consider limits j

we have

which is para-product of Bony, Coifman and Meyer.

Now we need to expand (46) into the wavelet bases. To expand each term in (46)
into wavelet basis, we need to consider the integrals of the products of the basis
functions, e.g.,

V VARIATIONAL WAVELET APPROACH
FOR PERIODIC TRAJECTORIES

We start with an extension of our approach to the case of periodic trajectories.
The equations of motion corresponding to Hamiltonians (from part II) may also
be formulated as a particular case of the general system of ordinary diﬀerential
equations dxi/dt = fi(xj, t), (i, j = 1, ..., n), 0
1, where fi are not more than
polynomial functions of dynamical variables xj and have arbitrary dependence of
time but with periodic boundary conditions. According to our variational approach
we have the solution in the following form:

≤

≤

t

xi(t) = xi(0) +

λk
i ϕk(t),

xi(0) = xi(1),

(71)

Xk

where λk
i are again the roots of reduced algebraical systems of equations with the
same degree of nonlinearity, and ϕk(t) corresponds to useful types of wavelet bases
(frames).
It should be noted that coeﬃcients of reduced algebraical system are
the solutions of additional linear problem and also depend on a particular type of
wavelet construction and type of bases.

This linear problem is our second reduced algebraical problem. We need to ﬁnd

in general situation objects

but now in the case of periodic boundary conditions. Now we consider the procedure
of their calculations in the case of periodic boundary conditions in the base of
periodic wavelet functions on the interval [0,1] and corresponding expansion (71)
inside our variational approach. Periodization procedure gives us

So, ˆϕ, ˆψ are periodic functions on the interval [0,1]. Because ϕj,k = ϕj,k′

So, we reduced our last problem to a standard linear algebraical problem. Then
we used the same methods as in part III C. As a result we obtained for closed
trajectories of orbital dynamics described by Hamiltonians from part II the explicit
time solution (71) in the base of periodized wavelets (73).

VI VARIATIONAL APPROACH IN BIORTHOGONAL

WAVELET BASES

Now we consider further generalization of our variational wavelet approach. In
[1]-[3] we consider diﬀerent types of variational principles which give us weak solu-
tions to our nonlinear problems.

Before this we consider the generalization of our wavelet variational approach to
the symplectic invariant calculation of closed loops in Hamiltonian systems [3]. We
also have the parametrization of our solution by some reduced algebraical prob-
lem; but in contrast to the general case where the solution is parametrized by
construction based on scalar reﬁnement equation, in the symplectic case we have
parametrization of the solution by matrix problems – Quadratic Mirror Filters
equations [3]. But because integrand of variational functionals is represented by a
bilinear form (scalar product), it seems more reasonable to consider wavelet con-
structions [15] which take into account all advantages of this structure.

The action functional for loops in the phase space is [16],

F (γ) =

pdq

H(t, γ(t))dt

1

Zγ

− Z
0

(78)

The critical points of F are those loops γ, which solve the Hamiltonian equations
associated with the Hamiltonian H and hence are periodic orbits. By the way,

all critical points of F are the saddle points of the inﬁnite Morse index, but sur-
prisingly this approach is very eﬀective. This will be demonstrated using several
variational techniques starting from minimax due to Rabinowitz and ending with
R, H is
Floer homology. So, (M, ω) is equal to symplectic manifolds, H : M

is a solution, satisfying the boundary conditions x(T ) = x(0), T > 0. Let us
consider the loop space Ω = C ∞(S1, R2n), where S1 = R/Z, of smooth loops in

i.e., x(t) is a solution of the Hamiltonian equations, which also satisﬁes x(0) = x(1),

R2k,

xk ∈

Xk∈Z

where J is the quasicomplex structure. We give relations between the quasicomplex
structure and wavelets in our second paper in this volume (see also [3]). But now
we need to take into account underlying bilinear structure via wavelets.

We started with two hierarchical sequences of approximations spaces [15]:

. . . V−2 ⊂

V1 ⊂

V2 . . . ,

. . .

V−2 ⊂

V−1 ⊂

and as usual, W0 is a complement to V0 in V1, but now not necessarily an orthogonal
complement. New orthogonality conditions now have the following form:

spaces. Two multiresolutions are intertwining Vj + Wj = Vj+1,

These are direct sums but not orthogonal sums.

where synthesis wavelets are used to synthesize the function. But ˜bjk comes from
inner products with analysis wavelets. Biorthogonality yields

f (t) =

˜bjkψjk(t),

Xj,k

˜bℓm =

f (t) ˜ψℓm(t)dt.

Z

(89)

(90)

So, now we can introduce this more complicated construction into our variational
approach. We have a modiﬁcation only on the level of computing coeﬃcients of
a reduced nonlinear algebraical system. This new construction is more ﬂexible.
The biorthogonal point of view is more stable under the action of a large class of
operators, while the orthogonal (one scale for multiresolution) is fragile all compu-
tations are much simpler and we accelerate the rate of convergence. In all types of
Hamiltonian calculation, which are based on some bilinear structures (symplectic
or Poissonian structures, bilinear form of integrand in variational integral), this
framework leads to greater success.

VII VARIABLE COEFFICIENTS

In the case when we have a situation where our problem is described by a system
of nonlinear (polynomial)diﬀerential equations, we need to consider extension of
our previous approach, which can take into account any type of variable coeﬃcients
(periodic, regular or singular). We can produce such an approach if we add in our
construction an additional reﬁnement equation, which would encode all information
about variable coeﬃcients [17]. According to our variational approach we need to
compute integrals of the form

bij(t)(ϕ1)d1(2mt

k1)(ϕ2)d2(2mt

k2)dx,

−

−

ZD

where now bij(t) are arbitrary functions of time, where trial functions ϕ1, ϕ2 satisfy
a reﬁnement equation:

ϕi(t) =

aikϕi(2t

k)

−

Xk∈Z

If we consider all computations in the class of compactly supported wavelets, then
only a ﬁnite number of coeﬃcients do not vanish. To approximate the non-constant
coeﬃcients, we need to choose a diﬀerent reﬁnable function ϕ3, along with some
local approximation scheme,

(Bℓf )(x) :=

Fℓ,k(f )ϕ3(2ℓt

k),

−

Xα∈Z

where Fℓ,k are suitable functionals supported in a small neighborhood of 2−ℓk, and
then replace bij in (91) by Bℓbij(t). In this particular case, one can take a char-
acteristic function and can thus approximate non-smooth coeﬃcients locally. To
guarantee suﬃcient accuracy of the resulting approximation to (91) it is important
to have the ﬂexibility of choosing ϕ3 diﬀerent from ϕ1, ϕ2. In the case when D is
some domain, we can write

bij(t)

|D=

bij(t)χD(2ℓt

k),

−

X0≤k≤2ℓ

where χD is a characteristic function of D. So, if we take ϕ4 = χD, which is again
a reﬁnable function, then the problem of the computation of (91) is reduced to the
problem of calculation of the integral

H(k1, k2, k3, k4) = H(k) =

ϕ4(2jt

k1)ϕ3(2ℓt

k2)ϕd1

1 (2rt

k3)ϕd2

2 (2st

k4)dx .

−

−

−

−

Rs

Z

The key point is that these integrals also satisfy some sort of reﬁnement equation:

2−|µ|H(k) =

b2k−ℓH(ℓ),

µ = d1 + d2.

Xℓ∈Z

This equation can be interpreted as the problem of computing an eigenvector. Thus,
we reduced the problem of the extension of our method to the case of variable
coeﬃcients to the same standard algebraical problem as in the preceding sections.
So, the general scheme is the same one, and we have only one more additional linear
algebraic problem by which we, in the same way, can parameterize the solutions of
the corresponding problem.

An extended version and related results may be found in [1]-[6].

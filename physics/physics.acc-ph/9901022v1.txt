retical and experimental studies. Besides continued work on the parameters of a 3-4 and 0.5 TeV
center-of-mass (CoM) energy collider, many studies are now concentrating on a machine near 0.1 TeV
(CoM) that could be a factory for the s-channel production of Higgs particles. We discuss the re-
search on the various components in such muon colliders, starting from the proton accelerator
needed to generate pions from a heavy-Z target and proceeding through the phase rotation and
decay (π
µ νµ) channel, muon cooling, acceleration, storage in a collider ring and the collider
detector. We also present theoretical and experimental R & D plans for the next several years that
should lead to a better understanding of the design and feasibility issues for all of the components.
This report is an update of the progress on the R & D since the Feasibility Study of Muon Colliders
presented at the Snowmass’96 Workshop [R. B. Palmer, A. Sessler and A. Tollestrup, Proceedings of
the 1996 DPF/DPB Summer Study on High-Energy Physics (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center,
Menlo Park, CA, 1997)].

I. INTRODUCTION

The Standard Model of electroweak and strong interactions has passed precision experimental tests at the highest
energy scale accessible today. Theoretical arguments indicate that new physics beyond the Standard Model associated
with the electroweak gauge symmetry breaking and fermion mass generation will emerge in parton collisions at or
approaching the TeV energy scale. It is likely that both hadron-hadron and lepton-antilepton colliders will be required
to discover and make precision measurements of the new phenomena. The next big step forward in advancing the
hadron-hadron collider energy frontier will be provided by the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a proton-proton
collider with a center-of-mass (CoM) energy of 14 TeV which is due to come into operation in 2005. Note that in a
high energy hadron beam, valence quarks carry momenta which are, approximately, between 1
9 of the hadron
momentum. The LHC will therefore provide hard parton-parton collisions with typical center of mass energies of
2.3

6 to 1

1.5 TeV.

The route towards TeV-scale lepton-antilepton colliders is less clear. The lepton-antilepton colliders built so far
have been e+e− colliders, such as the Large Electron Positron collider (LEP) at CERN and the Stanford Linear
E4/ρ, where
Collider (SLC) at SLAC. In a circular ring such as LEP the energy lost per revolution in keV is 88.5
the electron energy E is in GeV, and the radius of the orbit ρ is in meters. Hence, the energy loss grows rapidly as
E increases. This limits the center-of-mass energy that would be achievable in a LEP-like collider. The problem can
be avoided by building a linear machine (the SLC is partially linear), but with current technologies, such a machine
must be very long (30-40 km) to attain the TeV energy scale. Even so, radiation during the beam-beam interaction
(beamstrahlung) limits the precision of the CoM energy [1].

For a lepton with mass m the radiative energy losses are inversely proportional to m4. Hence, the energy-loss

problem can be solved by using heavy leptons. In practice this means using muons, which have a mass

≈

≈

that of an electron. The resulting reduction in radiative losses enables higher energies to be reached and smaller
collider rings to be used [2,3]. Parameters for 10 to 100 TeV collider have been discussed [4,5]. Estimated sizes of the
accelerator complexes required for 0.1-TeV, 0.5-TeV and 4-TeV muon colliders are compared with the sizes of other
possible future colliders, and with the FNAL and BNL sites in Fig. 1. Note that muon colliders with CoM energies
up to
4 TeV would ﬁt on these existing laboratory sites. The cost of building a muon collider is not yet known.
However, since muon colliders are relatively small, they may be signiﬁcantly less expensive than alternative machines.
Since muons decay quickly, large numbers of them must be produced to operate a muon collider at high luminosity.
Collection of muons from the decay of pions produced in proton-nucleus interactions results in a large initial phase
volume for the muons, which must be reduced (cooled) by a factor of 106 for a practical collider. This may be
compared with the antiproton stochastic cooling achieved in the Tevatron. In this case the 6-dimensional (6-D) phase
space is reduced by approximately a factor of 106, while with stacking the phase space density [6,7] is increased by a
factor of 1010. The technique of ionization cooling is proposed for the µ+µ− collider [8–11]. This technique is uniquely
applicable to muons because of their minimal interaction with matter.

Muon colliders also oﬀer some signiﬁcant physics advantages. The small radiative losses permit very small beam-
energy spreads to be achieved. For example, momentum spreads as low as ∆P/P = 0.003% are believed to be
possible for a low-energy collider. By measuring the time-dependent decay asymmetry resulting from the naturally
6.
polarized muons, it has been shown [12] that the beam energy could be determined with a precision of ∆E/E = 10−
The small beam-energy spread, together with the precise energy determination, would facilitate measurements of
the masses and widths of any new resonant states scanned by the collider. In addition, since the cross-section for
producing a Higgs-like scalar particle in the s-channel (direct lepton-antilepton annihilation) is proportional to m2,
this extremely important process could be studied only at a muon collider and not at an e+e− collider [13]. Finally,
the decaying muons will produce copious quantities of neutrinos. Even short straight sections in a muon-collider
ring will result in neutrino beams several orders of magnitude higher in intensity than presently available, permitting
greatly extended studies of neutrino oscillations, nucleon structure functions, the CKM matrix, and precise indirect
measurements of the W -boson mass [14] (see section II.I).

The concept of muon colliders was introduced by G. I. Budker [2,3], and developed further by A. N. Skrinsky et
al. [15–22] and D. Neuﬀer [13,23–25]. They pointed out the signiﬁcant challenges in designing an accelerator complex
that can make, accelerate, and collide µ+ and µ− bunches all within the muon lifetime of 2.2 µs (cτ = 659 m).
A concerted study of a muon collider design has been underway in the U.S. since 1992 [26–42]. By the Sausalito
workshop [30] in 1995 it was realized that with new ideas and modern technology, it may be feasible to make muon
bunches containing a few times 1012 muons, compress their phase space and accelerate them up to the multi-TeV
energy scale before more than about 3/4 of them have decayed. With careful design of the collider ring and shielding
it appears possible to reduce to acceptable levels the backgrounds within the detector that arise from the very large
ﬂux of electrons produced in muon decays. These realizations led to an intense activity, which resulted in the muon-
collider feasibility study report [43,44] prepared for the 1996 DPF/DPB Summer Study on High-Energy Physics (the
Snowmass’96 workshop). Since then, the physics prospects at a muon collider have been studied extensively [45–47],
and the potential physics program at a muon collider facility has been explored in workshops [39] and conferences
[40].

Encouraged by further progress in developing the muon-collider concept, together with the growing interest and
involvement of the high-energy-physics community, the Muon Collider Collaboration became a formal entity in May
of 1997. The collaboration is led by an executive board with members from Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL),
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Budker Institute
for Nuclear Physics (BINP), University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), University of Mississippi and Princeton
University. The goal of the collaboration is to complete within a few years the R&D needed to determine whether a
Muon Collider is technically feasible, and if it is, to design the First Muon Collider.

Table I gives the parameters of the muon colliders under study [48–55], which have CoM energies of 0.1 TeV,
0.4 TeV and 3 TeV and Figs. 2 and 3 show possible outlines of the 0.1 TeV and 3 TeV machines. In the former
case, parameters are given in the table for operation with three diﬀerent beam-energy spreads: ∆p/p = 0.12, 0.01,

channel. To collect as many particles as possible within a useful energy interval, rf cavities are used to accelerate the
lower-energy particles and decelerate the higher-energy particles (so-called phase rotation). With two proton bunches
every accelerator cycle, the ﬁrst used to make and collect positive muons and the second to make and collect negative
muons, there are about 1013 muons of each charge available at the end of the decay channel per accelerator cycle.
If the proton accelerator is cycling at 15 Hz, then in an operational year (107 s), about 1021 positive and negative
muons would be produced and collected.

muon-collider complex is to cool the muon bunch, i.e., to turn the diﬀuse muon cloud into a very bright bunch with
small longitudinal and transverse dimensions, suitable for accelerating and injecting into a collider. The cooling must
be done within a time that is short compared to the muon lifetime. Conventional cooling techniques (stochastic
cooling [56] and electron cooling [16]) take too long. The technique proposed for cooling muons is called ionization
cooling [8,10,11], and will be discussed in detail in sec. V. Brieﬂy, the muons traverse some material in which they
lose both longitudinal and transverse momentum by ionization losses (dE/dx). The longitudinal momentum is then
replaced using an rf accelerating cavity, and the process is repeated many times until there is a large reduction in the
transverse phase space occupied by the muons. The energy spread within the muon beam can also be reduced by
using a wedge-shaped absorber in a region of dispersion (where the transverse position is momentum dependent). The
wedge is arranged so that the higher-energy particles pass through more material than lower-energy particles. Initial

calculations suggest that the 6-D phase space occupied by the initial muon bunches can be reduced by a factor of
105-106 before multiple Coulomb scattering and energy straggling limit further reduction. We reiterate that ionization
cooling is uniquely suited to muons because of the absence of strong nuclear interactions and electromagnetic shower
production for these particles at energies around 200 MeV/c.

Rapid acceleration to the collider beam energy is needed to avoid excessive particle loss from decay. It can be
achieved, initially in a linear accelerator, and later in recirculating linear accelerators, rapid-cycling synchrotron, or
ﬁxed-ﬁeld-alternating-gradient (FFAG) accelerators. Positive and negative muon bunches are then injected in opposite
directions into a collider storage ring and brought into collision at the interaction point. The bunches circulate and
collide for many revolutions before decay has depleted the beam intensities to an uninteresting level. Useful luminosity
can be delivered for about 800 revolutions for the high-energy collider and 450 revolutions for the low-energy one.

There are many interesting and challenging problems that need to be resolved before the feasibility of building
a muon collider can be demonstrated. For example, (i) heating from the very intense proton bunches may require
the use of of a liquid-jet target, and (ii) attaining the desired cooling factor in the ionization-cooling channel may
require the development of rf cavities with thin beryllium windows operating at liquid-nitrogen temperatures in high
solenoidal ﬁelds. In addition, the development of long liquid-lithium lenses may be desirable to provide stronger radial
focusing for the ﬁnal cooling stages.

This article describes the status of our muon-collider feasibility studies, and is organized as follows. Section II gives
a brief summary of the physics potential of muon colliders, including physics at the accelerator complex required for
a muon collider. Section III describes the proton-driver speciﬁcations for a muon collider, and two site-dependent
examples that have been studied in some detail. Section IV presents pion production, capture, and the pion-decay
channel, and section V discusses the design of the ionization-cooling channel needed to produce an intense muon beam
suitable for acceleration and injection into the ﬁnal collider. Sections VI and VII describe the acceleration scenario
and collider ring, respectively. Section VIII discusses backgrounds at the collider interaction point and section IX

deals with possible detector scenarios. A summary of the conclusions is given in section X.

II. THE PHYSICS POTENTIAL OF MUON COLLIDERS

A. Brief overview

The physics agenda at a muon collider falls into three categories: First Muon Collider (FMC) physics at a machine
with center-of-mass energies of 100 to 500 GeV; Next Muon Collider (NMC) physics at 3–4 TeV center-of-mass
energies; and front-end physics with a high-intensity muon source.

The FMC will be a unique facility for neutral Higgs boson (or techni-resonance) studies through s-channel resonance
production. Measurements can also be made of the threshold cross sections for production of W +W −, t¯t, Zh, and
1, ˜ℓ+ ˜ℓ− and ˜ν¯˜ν — that will determine the corresponding masses to high
pairs of supersymmetry particles — χ+
precision. A µ+µ−
Z 0 factory, utilizing the partial polarization of the muons, could allow signiﬁcant improvements
in sin2 θw precision and in B-mixing and CP-violating studies. In Fig. 4, we show the cross sections for SM processes
versus the CoM energy at the FMC. For the unique s-channel Higgs boson production, where √sµµ = mH , results
for three diﬀerent beam energy resolutions are presented.

The NMC will be particularly valuable for reconstructing supersymmetric particles of high mass from their complex
cascade decay chains. Also, any Z ′ resonances within the kinematic reach of the machine would give enormous event
rates. The eﬀects of virtual Z ′ states would be detectable to high mass. If no Higgs bosons exist below
1 TeV, then
the NMC would be the ideal machine for the study of strong W W scattering at TeV energies.

At the front end, a high-intensity muon source will permit searches for rare muon processes sensitive to branching
ratios that are orders of magnitude below present upper limits. Also, a high-energy muon-proton collider can be

In addition, the decaying
muons will provide high-intensity neutrino beams for precision neutrino cross-section measurements and for long-
baseline experiments [57–66]. Plus, there are numerous other new physics possibilities for muon facilities [44,39] that
we will not discuss in detail in this document.

B. Higgs boson physics

The expectation that there will be a light (mass below 2MW ) SM-like Higgs boson provides a major motivation for
the FMC, since such a Higgs boson can be produced with a very high rate directly in the s-channel. Theoretically, the
lightest Higgs boson h0 of the most general supersymmetric model is predicted to have mass below 150 GeV and to
be very SM-like in the usual decoupling limit. Indeed, in the minimal supersymmetric model, which contains the ﬁve
Higgs bosons h0, H 0, A0, H ±, one ﬁnds mh0 <
130 GeV. The light SUSY
h0 is regarded as the jewel in the SUSY crown. Experimentally, global analyses of precision electroweak data now
∼
indicate a strong preference for a light SM-like Higgs boson; this could well be the smoking gun for the SUSY Higgs
boson. The goals of the FMC for studying the SUSY Higgs sector via s-channel resonance production are: to measure
the light Higgs mass, width, and branching fractions with high precision, in particular suﬃcient to diﬀerentiate the
MSSM h0 from the SM hSM; and, to ﬁnd and study the heavier neutral Higgs bosons H 0 and A0.

The production of Higgs bosons in the s-channel with interesting rates is a unique feature of a muon collider [45,67].

C. Light particles in technicolor models

In most technicolor models, there will be light neutral and colorless technipion resonances, π0

below 500 GeV. Sample models include the recent top-assisted technicolor models [69], in which the technipion masses
are typically above 100 GeV, and models [70] in which the masses of the neutral colorless resonances come primarily
from the one-loop eﬀective potential and the lightest state typically has mass as low as 10 to 100 GeV. The widths
of these light neutral and colorless states in the top-assisted models will be of order 0.1 to 50 GeV [71]. In the one-
loop models, the width of the lightest technipion is typically in the range from 3 to 50 MeV. Neutral technirho and
techniomega resonances are also a typical feature of technicolor models. In all models, these resonances are predicted
to have substantial Yukawa-like couplings to muons and would be produced in the s-channel at a muon collider,

D. Exotic narrow resonance possibilities

There are important types of exotic physics that would be best probed in s-channel production of a narrow resonance
at a muon collider. Many extended Higgs sector models contain a doubly-charged Higgs boson ∆−− (and its ∆++
partner) that couples to µ−µ− via a Majorana coupling. The s-channel process µ−µ−
∆−− has been shown [72]
to probe extremely small values of this Majorana coupling, in particular values naturally expected in models where
such couplings are responsible for neutrino mass generation. In supersymmetry, it is possible that there is R-parity
violation. If R-parity violation is of the purely leptonic type, the coupling λµτ µ for µ−µ+
˜ντ is very possibly the
largest such coupling and could be related to neutrino mass generation. This coupling can be probed down to quite
small values via s-channel ˜ντ production at the muon collider [73].

A muon collider operating at the Z-boson resonance energy is an interesting option for measurement of polarization
asymmetries, B0
s mixing, and of CP violation in the B-meson system [74]. The muon collider advantages are
the partial muon beam polarization, and the long B-decay length for B-mesons produced at this √s. The left-
right asymmetry ALR is the most accurate measure of sin2 θw, since the uncertainty is statistics dominated. The

G. Heavy particles of supersymmetry

The requirements of gauge coupling uniﬁcation can be used to predict the mean SUSY mass scale, given the value
of the strong coupling constant at the Z-mass scale. Figure 10 shows the SUSY GUT predictions versus αs(MZ ). For
the value αs(MZ) = 0.1214
0.0031 from a new global ﬁt to precision electroweak data [75], a mean SUSY mass of
order 1 TeV is expected. Thus, it is likely that some SUSY particles will have masses at the TeV scale. Large masses
for the squarks of the ﬁrst family are perhaps the most likely in that this would provide a simple cure for possible
ﬂavor changing neutral current diﬃculties.

detection is deemed impossible if SUSY decays dominate).

Detection and study of the many scalar particles predicted in supersymmetric models could be a particularly
valuable contribution of a high energy lepton collider. However, since pair production of scalar particles at a lepton
collider is P -wave suppressed, energies well above threshold are needed for suﬃcient production rates; see Fig. 11. For
scalar particle masses of order 1 TeV a collider energy of 3 to 4 TeV is needed to get past the threshold suppression. A

In string models, it is very natural to have extra Z bosons in addition to low-energy supersymmetry. The s-channel
production of a Z ′ boson at the resonance energy would give enormous event rates at the NMC. Moreover, the s-
channel contributions of Z ′ bosons with mass far above the kinematic reach of the collider could be revealed as contact
interactions [85].

H. Strong scattering of weak bosons

J. Summary of the physics potential

The First Muon Collider oﬀers unique probes of supersymmetry (particularly s-channel Higgs boson resonances)
and technicolor models (via s-channel production of techni-resonances), high-precision threshold measurements of
W, t and SUSY particle masses, tests of SUSY radiative corrections that indirectly probe the existence of high-mass
squarks, and a possible Z 0 factory for improved precision in polarization measurements and for B-physics studies of
CP violation and mixing.

The Next Muon Collider guarantees access to heavy SUSY scalar particles and Z ′ states or to strong W W scattering

if there are no Higgs bosons and no supersymmetry.

The Front End of a muon collider oﬀers dramatic improvements in sensitivity for ﬂavor-violating transitions (e.g.,
eγ), access to high-Q2 phenomena in deep-inelastic muon-proton and neutrino-proton interactions, and the

µ
ability to probe very small δm2 via neutrino-oscillation studies in long-baseline experiments.

→

The muon collider would be crucial to unraveling the ﬂavor dependence of any type of new physics that is found at

the next generation of colliders.

Thus, muon colliders are robust options for probing new physics that may not be accessible at other colliders.

The overview of the required parameters is followed by a description of designs that have been studied in some

detail. The section concludes with a discussion of the outstanding open issues.

III. PROTON DRIVER

A. Speciﬁcations

The proton driver requirements are determined by the design luminosity of the collider, and the eﬃciencies of muon
collection, cooling, transport and acceleration. The baseline speciﬁcation is for a 4-MW, 16-GeV or a 7-MW, 30-GeV
proton driver, with a repetition rate of 15 Hz and 1014 protons per cycle in 2 bunches (for the 100-GeV machine) or
1013 protons, respectively. Half the bunches are used to make
4 bunches (for the higher energies) of 5
µ− and the rest for µ+ [90].

1013 or 2.5

×

×

The total beam power is several MW, which is larger than that of existing synchrotrons. However, except for bunch
length, these parameters are similar to those of Kaon factories [91] and spallation neutron sources [92]. As in those
cases, the proton driver must have very low losses to permit inexpensive maintenance of components.

The rms bunch length for the protons on target has to be about 1 ns to: 1) reduce the initial longitudinal emittance
of muons entering the cooling system, and 2) optimize the production of polarized muons. Although bunches of up
to 6

1013 protons per cycle have been accelerated, the required peak current is 2000 A, which is unprecedented.

Since the collection of highly polarized µ’s is ineﬃcient (see section IV.G), the proton driver should eventually
provide an additional factor of two or more in proton intensity to permit the luminosity to be maintained for polarized
muon beams.

B. Possible options

Accelerator designs are site, and to some extent, time dependent, and there have been three studies at three
diﬀerent energies (30 GeV [93], 16 GeV [94] and 24 GeV [95–98]; see also [99]). In general, if the ﬁnal energy is higher,
the required currents are lower, bunch manipulation and apertures are easier, and the ﬁnal momentum spread and
space-charge tune shifts are less. Lowering the ﬁnal energy gives somewhat more π’s/Watt, a lower rf requirement

be merged outside the driver. These two bunches would be extracted simultaneously from two diﬀerent extraction

1. A generic design

2. FNAL study

If a muon collider is built at an existing laboratory, then possibilities abound for symbiotic relationships with the
other facilities and programs of that laboratory. For example, the proton driver for a muon collider might result from
an upgrade of existing proton-source capabilities, and such an upgrade could then also enhance other future programs
that use the proton beams.

Fermilab has conceived such a proton-source development plan [100] with three major components: an upgraded
linac and two rapid-cycling (15 Hz) synchrotrons: a prebooster and a new booster. The two synchrotrons operate in
series; the four proton bunches for the muon collider are formed in the prebooster and then accelerated sequentially
in the prebooster and the booster. The plan could be implemented in stages, and other programs would beneﬁt from
each stage, but all three components are required to meet the luminosity goals of the muon colliders that have been
considered so far.

Table III presents the major parameters of the two rings. Whenever the needs of the muon collider itself allow
some ﬂexibility, the parameters have been chosen to optimize the resulting facility as a proton source for the rest of
the future program at Fermilab. For example, the machine circumferences and rf-harmonic numbers result in bunch
trains that are compatible with the existing downstream proton machines.

A muon collider requires proton bunches that are both very intense and, at the pion-production target, very short.
Strong transverse and longitudinal space-charge forces might disrupt such bunches in the synchrotrons unless measures
to alleviate those eﬀects are incorporated in the design. The Laslett incoherent-space-charge tune shift quantiﬁes the
severity of the transverse eﬀects. A useful approximation for the space-charge tune shift ∆νsc at the center of a round
Gaussian beam is

factors, and b

1 is the bunching factor, deﬁned as the ratio of the average beam current to the peak current.

10−

The approximation (20) implies that for a given total number of protons, here 1014, the factors in the denominator
are the only ways to reduce the tune shift to a speciﬁed maximum tolerable value, taken as 0.4. The bunching factor
can be raised somewhat by careful tailoring of beam distributions, but here a typical value of 0.25 is conservatively
assumed. Achieving the desired beam intensity then requires a combination of high injection energy, here taken as
1 GeV into the ﬁrst ring, and large transverse normalized emittances, here assumed to be about 200π mm-mrad.
The corresponding required aperture is about 13 cm in the ﬁrst ring and about 10 cm in the second ring. With such
large apertures in rapid-cycling synchrotrons, careful design of the beam pipes for both rings is required to manage
eddy-current eﬀects. Two approaches are under consideration. One is a thin Inconel pipe with water cooling and
eddy-current coil corrections integrated on the pipe, as in the AGS Booster. The other is a ceramic beam pipe with
a conductor inside to carry beam-image currents, as in ISIS.

×

The Fermilab linac presently delivers a 400-MeV beam, and is capable with modest modiﬁcations of accelerating as
1013 protons per cycle at 15 Hz [101]. A signiﬁcant upgrade is required in order to deliver 1014 protons at
many as 3
1 GeV. The energy can be raised by appending additional side-coupled modules to the downstream end of the linac.
Increasing the linac beam intensity probably means increasing both the beam current and the duration of the beam
pulse. Injection into the ﬁrst ring is by charge stripping of the H − beam; the incoming beam will be chopped and
injected into pre-existing buckets to achieve high capture eﬃciency.

The circumference of the second ring is set equal to that of the existing Fermilab Booster. This choice provides
several advantages. First, the new booster could occupy the same tunnel as a relocated Booster; secondly, the beam-
batch length from a full second ring matches that of the present Booster, which simpliﬁes matching to downstream
machines for other programs. The output energy of 16 GeV then results from an assumed dipole packing fraction
of 0.575 and a peak dipole ﬁeld of 1.3 T, which is the highest dipole ﬁeld that is consistent with straightforward,
nonsaturating design of magnets having thin silicon-steel laminations. Driving such magnets into saturation would
cause signiﬁcant heating of the magnet yoke as well as potential problems with tracking between the dipoles and
quadrupoles.

The prebooster also has 1.3-T dipole ﬁelds, and its circumference is one third that of the new booster; it operates
at an rf harmonic number h = 4. The strategy for achieving the required short bunches at the target while alleviating
space-charge eﬀects in the rings is to start with four bunches occupying most of the circumference of the ﬁrst small
ring in order to keep the bunching factor large, and to do a bunch-shortening rotation in longitudinal phase space
just before extraction from the second synchrotron. The four bunches are accelerated in the ﬁrst ring to 3 GeV, then
transferred bunch-to-bucket into the second ring with its harmonic number h = 12. At that energy, the kinematic
factor in the tune-shift formula (20) is large enough to compensate for the smaller bunching factor in the second ring.
The transfer energy of 3 GeV between the two rings roughly equalizes their space-charge tune shifts.

Both rings employ separated-function lattices with ﬂexible momentum compaction in order to raise their transition
energies above their respective extraction energies. This not only avoids having to accelerate beam through transition
but also provides other advantages.
Intense beams are not subject to certain instabilities such as the negative-
mass instability below transition and empirically seem less susceptible to other instabilities such as the microwave
instability. Also, the negative natural chromaticity is beneﬁcial for stabilizing the beam below transition, thereby
perhaps obviating the need for sextupole correctors, especially in the ﬁrst ring. Having transition not too far above
extraction also provides substantial bucket area in which to accomplish beam-shortening rf manipulations.

Several potential sources of instabilities in the rings have been examined [102], as well as the possibility of com-
pensating the latter eﬀect by inductive inserts in the rings. Space charge is the main factor aﬀecting the stability of
the beams; the rings appear to be safe from longitudinal- and transverse-microwave instabilities. Of course, standard
stabilizing methods such as active dampers are necessary to counteract some of the instabilities. Flexible momentum-
compaction lattices would be useful not only to raise the transition energy above the extraction energy, but also to
allow fast changes in the slip factor to facilitate bunch-narrowing manipulations at extraction time. Compensation of
longitudinal space-charge eﬀects by means of ferrite-loaded inductive inserts would be useful, especially for the ﬁrst
ring.

The magnet-power-supply circuit for each ring is a 15-Hz resonant system like that of the existing Booster, with
dipoles and quadrupoles electrically in series. This implies that the second ring will accelerate only one batch at a
time from the ﬁrst ring, which is all that the muon collider needs. Adding about 15% of second harmonic to the
magnet ramp reduces the required peak accelerating voltage by about 25%, which is probably worth doing, especially
for the second ring with its large voltage requirement.

One of the advantages of a two-ring system is that the two rings divide the work of accelerating the beam. The
rf system of the ﬁrst ring is relatively modest because of its small circumference and small energy gain; that of the
second ring is simpliﬁed because its high injection energy means a small rf-frequency swing [103].

ESME simulations of longitudinal motion show that the rms bunch length is 2 nsec as desired after the bunch
rotation that occurs just before extraction from the second synchrotron.The bunch rotation creates momentum spreads
of about 2% with longitudinal emittances of about 2 eV-s per bunch. Such spreads would contribute a few cm in
quadrature to the beam size for a short period before extraction. This is thought to be tolerable, given the large
apertures that are required in any case. High injection energies help to alleviate these longitudinal eﬀects, which
result from space-charge voltages having the same 1/βγ2 kinematic dependence as the transverse tune shifts.

3. AGS upgrade

The third study [95–98] is of an upgrade to the BNL AGS, which should produce bunches larger than those required
1013 protons in eight bunches
for the muon collider, but at a lower repetition rate. The AGS presently produces 6
at 25 GeV and 0.6 Hz. A 2.5-GeV accumulator ring in the AGS tunnel and AGS power-supply upgrade to 2.5-Hz
operation would match the repetition rate to the 10-Hz repetition rate of the booster. This would generate 1 MW
1014 protons per pulse
beam power. With an additional upgrade of the linac energy to 600 MeV, an intensity of 2
1013 at 25 GeV and 2.5 Hz could be reached, raising the power to 2 MW. The upgrades to the
in four bunches of 5
AGS accelerator complex are summarized in Fig.13. Other options are also under consideration, such as the addition
of a second booster and 5-Hz operation, that would reach the baseline speciﬁcation of 4 MW.

The AGS momentum acceptance of

3% requires that the longitudinal phase space occupied by one bunch be less
than 4.5 eV-s. This high bunch density in turn generates stringent demands on the earlier parts of the accelerator
cycle. In particular, Landau damping from the beam momentum spread may guard against resistive wall instabilities
during injection and longitudinal microwave instabilities after transition. Beam stability can be restored with a more-

±

22

powerful transverse-damping system and possibly a new low-impedance vacuum chamber. The transverse microwave
instability is predicted to occur after transition crossing unless damped by Landau damping from incoherent tune
spread or possibly high-frequency quadrupoles.

C. Progress and open issues

Conventional rf manipulations appear able to produce 1- to 2-ns proton bunches if enough rf voltage to overcome
the space-charge forces is used, and the beam energy is far enough from transition so the ﬁnal bunch rotation is fast.
Both simulations and experimental work have been directed at demonstrating that a short pulse can be produced
easily.

An experiment at the AGS has shown that bunches with σz = 2 ns can be produced near transition from bunches
7 GeV)
8 ns by bunch rotation [104,105]. In this experiment, the AGS was ﬂattoped near transition (
with σz ∼
while the γt-jump system was used to bring the transition energy suddenly to the beam energy, letting the bunch-
energy spread expand and bunch length contract. The experiment also demonstrated that bunches are stable over
periods of 0.1 s. In addition, the data were used to measure the lowest two orders of the momentum compaction
factor.

∼

The AGS bunch area, 1.5 eV-s, was comparable to that expected in the proton driver, but the bunch charge (though
1012 protons) was only about one tenth of that required by the muon target. The proton driver
as large as 3-5
would use a ﬂexible momentum compaction lattice which would give much better control of the transition energy,
permitting a very fast ﬁnal bunch rotation [106]. In addition, the rf frequency would be higher than that of the AGS
so the buckets (and bunches) would initially be only half as long. Thus bunch rotation could be expected to be easier
with the new machine, which should compensate for the larger charge.

×

Simulations with the ESME code have also shown that 1-2 ns bunches of 5

1013 can be produced at extraction in

a 16-GeV ring with the rf and emittance shown in Table III.

×

The eﬃciency of capturing and accelerating beam may be increased by compensation of the space-charge forces in
the proton driver. The use of tunable inductive inserts in the ring vacuum chamber may permit active control and
compensation of the longitudinal space charge below transition (since the inductive impedance is of the opposite sign
to the capacitive space charge). Initial experiments at the KEK proton synchrotron and Los Alamos PSR [107] with
short ferrite inserts appear to show a reduction in the synchrotron oscillation frequency shift caused by space charge
and a decrease in the necessary rf voltage to maintain a given bunch intensity. Further experiments are needed to
demonstrate this technique fully.

The high rf voltage and beam power and the relatively small size of the machine require high-gradient, high-power
rf cavities. Fermilab, BNL and KEK are collaborating on research and development of such type of cavities.This
work includes the study of magnet alloys and hybrid cavities using both ferrite and new magnet alloys, high-power
ampliﬁers and beam-loading compensation.

The employment of barrier-bucket [108] rf cavities can eﬀectively generate and manipulate a gap in the beam and
kV
reduce the space-charge eﬀect. A successful test of this scheme has recently been completed [109], and two 40
barrier cavities have been built by BNL and KEK and are being installed on the AGS. Another high-gradient barrier
cavity using magnet alloys is under study at Fermilab.

IV. PION PRODUCTION, CAPTURE AND PHASE ROTATION CHANNEL

This section ﬁrst discusses the choice of target technology and optimization of the target geometry, and then
describes design studies for the pion capture and phase rotation channel. Prospects for polarized muon beams are
discussed in detail. The section concludes with an outline of an R&D program for target and phase rotation issues.
Figure 14 gives an overview of the conﬁguration for production of pions by a proton beam impinging on a long,
transversely thin target, followed by capture of low-momentum, forward pions in a channel of solenoid magnets with
rf cavities to compress the bunch energy while letting the bunch length grow. This arrangement performs the desired
rotation of the beam.

The pions are produced in the interaction of the proton beam with the primary target. Extensive simulations have
been performed for pion production from 8-30 GeV proton beams on diﬀerent target materials in a high-ﬁeld solenoid
[44,110–113]. Three diﬀerent Monte Carlo codes [114–117] predict similar pion yields despite signiﬁcant diﬀerences
in their physics models. Some members of the Collaboration are involved in an AGS experiment BNL E-910 [118] to
measure the yield of very low momentum pions, which will validate the codes in the critical kinematic region. This
experiment ran for 14 weeks during the Spring of 1996 and has collected over 20 million events, of which about a
quarter are minimum bias triggers for inclusive cross section measurements. The targets were varied in material (Be,
Cu, Au, U) and thickness (2–100% interaction length (λI )) and three diﬀerent beam momenta were used (6, 12.5,
18 GeV/c). Presently, the E910 collaboration is doing a careful analysis of the large data sample obtained. Figure 15
shows the dE/dx energy vs. momentum for reconstructed tracks in the TPC; there is clear particle species separation
[119].

The pion yield is greater for relatively high Z materials, and for these, the pion yield is maximal for longitudinal
momenta of the same order as the average transverse momentum (
200 MeV/c). Targets of varying composition
(6 < Z < 82), radii (0.2-3 cm) and thicknesses (0.5-3 nuclear interaction lengths) have been explored using a Monte
Carlo simulation [111]. For a ﬁxed number of interaction lengths, the pion yield per proton rises almost linearly with
proton energy, and hence almost proportional to the energy deposited in the target. The yield is higher for medium-
and high-Z target materials, with a noticeable gain at Z > 26 for 30 GeV proton beams, but with only a minor eﬀect

rates due to reabsorption, while smaller diameter targets have less production from secondary interactions. Tilting the
target by 100-150 mrad minimizes loss of pions by absorption in the target after one turn on their helical trajectory
[50,120]. Another advantage of the tilted target geometry is that the high energy and neutral components of the
shower can be absorbed in a water-cooled beam dump to the side of the focused beam.

About 30 kJ of energy is deposited in the target by each proton pulse (10% of the beam energy). Hence, the target
absorbs 400 kW of power at the 15-Hz pulse rate. Cooling of the target via contact with a thermal bath would lead
to unacceptable absorption of pions, and radiative cooling is inadequate for such high power in a compact target.
Therefore, the target must move so as to carry the energy deposited by the proton beam to a heat exchanger outside
the solenoid channel.

Both moving solid metal and ﬂowing liquid targets have been considered, with the latter as the currently preferred
solution. A liquid is relatively easy to move, easy to cool, can be readily removed and replaced, and is the preferred
target material for most spallation neutron sources under study. A liquid ﬂowing in a pipe was considered, but
experience at ISOLDE with short proton pulses [121] as well as simulations [122,123] suggest serious problems in
shock damage to the pipe. An open liquid jet is thus proposed.

A jet of liquid mercury has been demonstrated [122] but not exposed to a beam. For our application, safety and
other considerations favor the use of a low melting point lead alloy rather than mercury. Gallium alloys, though
with lower density, are also being considered. Experimental and theoretical studies are underway to determine the
consequences of beam shock heating of the liquid. It is expected that the jet will disperse after being exposed to the
beam. The target station must survive damage resulting from the violence in this dispersion. This consideration will
determine the minimum beam, and thus jet, radius.

For a conducting liquid jet in a strong magnetic ﬁeld, as proposed, strong eddy currents will be induced in the jet,
causing reaction forces that may disrupt its ﬂow [124,125]. The forces induced are proportional to the square of the
jet radius, and set a maximum for this radius of order 5-10 mm. If this maximum is smaller than the minimum radius
set by shock considerations, then multiple smaller beams and jets could be used; e.g., four jets of 5 mm radius with
1013 protons per bunch. Other alternatives include targets made from insulating materials such
four beams with 2.5
as liquid PtO2 or Re2O3, slurries (e.g., Pt in water), or powders [126].

A moving solid metal target is not the current baseline solution, but is a serious possibility. In this case, the target
could consist of a long ﬂat band or hoop of copper-nickel that moves along its length (as in a band saw) [127]. The
band would be many meters in length, would be cooled by gas jets away from the target area, and would be supported
and moved by rollers, as shown in Fig. 17.

The choice and parameters of the target are critical issues that need resolution. These can be resolved by experiments

with a strong magnetic ﬁeld and a beam, as discussed in section IV.H.

C. Capture

To capture all pions with transverse momenta pT less than their typical value of 200 MeV/c, the product of the
capture solenoid ﬁeld B and its radius Ra must be greater than 1.33 T m. The use of a high ﬁeld and small radius
is preferred to minimize the corresponding transverse emittance, which is proportional to BR2: for a ﬁxed transverse
momentum capture, this emittance is thus proportional to R. A ﬁeld of 20 T and 7.5 cm radius was chosen on the
basis of simulations described below. This gives BR = 1.5 T m, BR2 = 0.1125 T m2 and a maximum transverse
momentum capture of pT = 225 MeV/c.

A preliminary design [128] of the capture solenoid has an inner 6 T, 4 MW, water cooled, hollow conductor magnet
with an inside diameter of 24 cm and an outside diameter of 60 cm. There is space for a 4 cm thick, water cooled,
heavy metal shield inside the coil. The outer superconducting magnet has three coils, with inside diameters of 60 to
80 cm. It generates an additional 14 T of ﬁeld at the target and provides the required tapered ﬁeld to match into the
decay channel. Such a hybrid solenoid has parameters compatible with those of existing magnets [129].

The 20 T capture solenoid is matched via a transfer solenoid [110] into a decay channel consisting of a system of
superconducting solenoids with the same adiabatic invariant BR2
RpT . Thus, for a 1.25 T decay channel, B drops
by a factor of 16 between the target and decay channel, R and pT change by factors of 4 and 1/4, respectively. This
permits improved acceptance of transverse momentum within the decay channel, at the cost of an increased spread
in longitudinal momentum. Figure 16(b) shows the meson yield as a function of ﬁeld in the capture solenoid, with
the radius of the capture solenoid adjusted to maintain the same BR2
a as in the decay channel. The optimum ﬁeld is
20 T in the capture solenoid.

∝

If the axis of the target is coincident with that of the solenoid ﬁeld, then there is a relatively high probability that
pions re-enter the target after one cycle on their helical trajectory and are lost due to nuclear interactions. When
the target and proton beam are set at an angle of 100-150 mrad with respect to the ﬁeld axis [111], the probability
for such pion interactions at the target is reduced, and the overall production rate is increased by 60%, as shown in
Fig. 16(d).

In summary, the simulations indicate that a 20 T solenoid of 16 cm inside diameter surrounding a tilted target will
capture about half of all produced pions. With target eﬃciency included, about 0.6 pions per proton will enter the
pion decay channel [111].

D. Phase rotation linac

The pions, and the muons into which they decay, have a momentum distribution with an rms spread of approximately
100% and a peak at about 200 MeV/c. It would be diﬃcult to handle such a wide spread in any subsequent system.
A linac is thus introduced along the decay channel, with frequencies and phases chosen to decelerate the fast particles
and accelerate the slow ones; i.e., to phase rotate the muon bunch. Several studies have been made of the design of
this system, using diﬀering ranges of rf frequency, delivering diﬀerent ﬁnal muon momenta, and diﬀering ﬁnal bunch
lengths. In all cases, muon capture eﬃciencies of close to 0.3 muons per proton are obtained. Until the early stages
of the ionization cooling have been designed, it is not yet possible to choose between them. Independent of the above
choices is a question of the location of the focusing solenoid coils and rf cavity design, as discussed below in the
section IV.F.

1. Lower energy, longer bunch example

This example captures muons at a mean kinetic energy of 130 MeV. Table IV gives parameters of the linacs used.
Monte Carlo simulations [52], with the program MUONMC [130], were done using pion production calculated by
ARC [114] for a copper target of 1-cm radius at an angle of 150 mrad. A uniform solenoidal ﬁeld was assumed in the
phase rotation, and the rf was approximated by a series of kicks.

Figure 18 shows the energy vs. ct at the end of the decay and phase rotation channel. The abscissa ct is a measure
of bunch length at the end of the channel: the total transit time of each π/µ is multiplied by the velocity of light and
the total length of the channel is subtracted. Thus a ﬁcticious reference particle at the center of the incident bunch
at the target arrives at ct = 0 m. A loose ﬁnal bunch selection was deﬁned with an energy 130
70 MeV and bunch
ct from 3 to 11 m. With this selection, the rms energy spread is 16.5%, the rms ct is 1.7 m, and there are 0.39 muons
per incident proton. A tighter selection with an energy 130
35 MeV and bunch ct from 4 to 10 m gave an rms
energy spread of 11.7%, rms ct of 1.3 m, and contained 0.31 muons per incident proton.

2. Higher energy, shorter bunch example

In this example the captured muons have a mean kinetic energy close to 320 MeV. It is based on a Monte Carlo
study which uses the updated MARS pion production model [116] to generate pions created by 16 GeV protons on
a 36 cm long, 1 cm radius coaxial gallium target. Figure 19 shows the longitudinal phase space of the muons at the
end of an 80 m long, 5 T solenoidal decay channel with cavities of frequency in the 30-90 MHz range and acceleration
gradients of 4-18 MeV/m. A total of 0.33 muons per proton fall within the indicated cut (6 m
300 MeV). The
rms bunch length inside the cut is 148 cm and rms energy spread is 62 MeV. The normalized six dimensional (6-D)
emittance is 217 cm3 and the transverse part is 1.86 cm (the normalized 6-D emittance ǫ6,N is deﬁned in section V).
A sample simulation with lithium hydride absorbers regularly spaced in the last 60 m of a 120 m decay channel and
300 MeV)
with compensating acceleration captures 0.3 muons with mean kinetic energy of about 380 MeV in a (6 m
window. The longitudinal phase space is about the same as in the previous example but the transverse part shrinks
to 0.95 cm due to ionization cooling which reduces the 6-D phase space to 73.5 cm3.

E. Use of both signs

Protons on the target produce pions of both signs, and a solenoid will capture both, but the subsequent rf systems
will have opposite eﬀects on each sign. The proposed baseline approach uses two separate proton bunches to create
separate positive and negative pion bunches and accepts the loss of half the pions/muons during phase rotation.

If the pions can be charge separated with limited loss before the phase rotation cavities are reached, then higher
luminosity may be obtained. The separation of charged pions in a curved solenoid decay line was studied in [110].
Because of the resulting dispersion in a bent solenoid, an initial beam of radius R with maximum-to-minimum
momentum ratio F will require a large beampipe of radius (1 + F )R downstream to accommodate the separated
beams. A septum can then be used to capture the two beams into separate channels. Typically the reduction in
yield for a curved solenoid compared to a straight solenoid is about 25% (due to the loss of very low and very high
momentum pions to the walls or septum), but this must be weighed against the fact that both charge signs are captured
for an overall net gain. A disadvantage is that this charge separation takes place over several meters of length during
which time the beam spreads longitudinally. This makes capture in an rf phase rotation system diﬃcult, although
a large aperture cavity system could be incorporated in the bent solenoid region to alleviate this. The technique
deserves further study and may be useful to consider as an intensity upgrade to a muon collection system.

F. Solenoids and rf

As noted above, capture using higher frequencies appears to be less eﬃcient, and most studies now use frequencies
down to 30 MHz. Such cavities, when conventionally designed, are very large (about 6.6 m diameter). In the Snowmass
study [131] a reentrant design reduced this diameter to 2.52 m, but this is still large, and it was ﬁrst assumed that
the 5 T focusing solenoids would, for economic reasons, be placed within the irises of the cavities (see Fig. 20).

A study of transmission down a realistic system of iris located coils revealed betatron resonant excitation from the
magnetic ﬁeld periodicities, leading to signiﬁcant particle loss. This was reduced by the use of more complicated coil
shapes [131], smaller gaps, and shorter cavities, but remained a problem.

An alternative is to place continuous focusing coils outside the cavities as shown in Fig. 14. In this case, cost will be
minimized with lower magnetic ﬁelds (1.25-2.5 T) and correspondingly larger decay channel radii (21-30 cm). Studies
are underway to determine the optimal solution.

Polarization of the muon beams presents a signiﬁcant physics advantage over the unpolarized case, since signal and

background of electroweak processes usually come predominantly from diﬀerent polarization states.

G. Polarization

1. Polarized muon production

In the center of mass of a decaying pion, the outgoing muon is fully polarized (P =

1 for µ+ and +1 for µ−).
In the lab system the polarization depends on the decay angle θd and initial pion energy [132–134]. For pion kinetic
energy larger than the pion mass, the average polarization is about 20%, and if nothing else is done, the polarization
of the captured muons after the phase rotation system is approximately this value.

If this selection is made on both beams, and if the proton bunch intensity is maintained, then each muon bunch
is reduced by the factor Fsurv and the luminosity would fall by F 2
surv. But if, instead, proton bunches are merged
so as to obtain half as many bunches with twice the intensity, then the muon bunch intensity is maintained and the
luminosity (and repetition rate) falls only as Fsurv.

The luminosity could be maintained at the full unpolarized value if the proton source intensity could be increased.
Such an increase in proton source intensity in the unpolarized case might be impractical because of the resultant
excessive high energy muon beam power, but this restriction does not apply if the increase is used to oﬀset losses in
generating polarization.

Thus, the goal of high muon beam polarization may shift the parameters of the muon collider towards lower

repetition rate and higher peak currents in the proton driver.

The preservation of muon polarization has been discussed in some detail in [135]. During the ionization cooling

In the collider, bending can be performed with the spin orientation in the vertical direction, and the spin rotated
into the longitudinal direction only for the interaction region. The design of such spin rotators appears relatively
straightforward, but long. This might be a preferred solution at high energies but is not practical in the 100 GeV
machine. An alternative is to use such a small energy spread, as in the Higgs factory, that although the polarization
vector precesses, the beam polarization does not become signiﬁcantly diluted. In addition, calibration of the Higgs
factory collider energy to 1 part in a million [12] requires the spins to precess continuously from turn to turn.

H. R&D program

An R&D program is underway to continue theoretical studies (optimization of pion production and capture) and
to clarify several critical issues related to targetry and phase rotation [136]. A jet of the room temperature eutectic
1013 24 GeV protons at the Brookhaven AGS to
liquid alloy of Ga-Sn will be exposed to nanosecond pulses of 1.5
study the eﬀect of the resulting pressure wave on the liquid. The same jet will also be used in conjunction with a 20 T,
20 cm bore resistive magnet at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (Tallahassee, FL) to study the eﬀect of
eddy currents on jet propagation. Then, a pulsed, 20 T magnet will be added to the BNL test station to explore the
full conﬁguration of jet, magnet and pulsed proton beam. Also, a 70 MHz rf cavity will be exposed to the intense ﬂux
of secondary particles downstream of the target and 20 T magnet to determine viable operating parameters for the
ﬁrst phase rotation cavity. The complete conﬁguration of the targetry experiment is sketched in Fig. 22.

The design of an eﬃcient and practical cooling system is one of the major challenges for the muon collider project.

V. IONIZATION COOLING

A. Introduction

32

−

For a high luminosity collider, the 6-D phase space volume occupied by the muon beam must be reduced by a factor
of 105
106. Furthermore, this phase space reduction must be done within a time that is not long compared to the
2 µs). Cooling by synchrotron radiation, conventional stochastic cooling and conventional
muon lifetime (µ lifetime
electron cooling are all too slow. Optical stochastic cooling [137], electron cooling in a plasma discharge [138], and
cooling in a crystal lattice [139,140] are being studied, but appear technologically diﬃcult. The new method proposed
for cooling muons is ionization cooling. This technique [16,18,20,141] is uniquely applicable to muons because of their
minimal interaction with matter. It is a method that seems relatively straightforward in principle, but has proven
quite challenging to implement in practice

≈

Ionization cooling involves passing the beam through some material in which the muons lose both transverse and
longitudinal momentum by ionization energy loss, commonly referred to as dE/dx. The longitudinal muon momentum
is then restored by reacceleration, leaving a net loss of transverse momentum (transverse cooling). The process is
repeated many times to achieve a large cooling factor.

The energy spread can be reduced by introducing a transverse variation in the absorber density or thickness (e.g. a
wedge) at a location where there is dispersion (the transverse position is energy dependent). This method results in a
corresponding increase of transverse phase space and is thus an exchange of longitudinal and transverse emittances.
With transverse cooling, this allows cooling in all dimensions.

invariant emittance ǫ6,N , which is proportional to the area in the 6-D phase space (x, y, z, px, py, pz) since, to a fairly
good approximation, it is preserved during acceleration and storage in the collider ring. This quantity is the square
root of the determinant of a general quadratic moment matrix containing all possible correlations. However, until the
nature and practical implications of these correlations are understood, it is more conservative to ignore the correlations
and use the following simpliﬁed expression for 6-D normalized emittance,

Theoretical studies have shown that, assuming realistic parameters for the cooling hardware, ionization cooling can
be expected to reduce the phase space volume occupied by the initial muon beam by a factor of 105 – 106. A complete
cooling channel would consist of 20 – 30 cooling stages, each stage yielding about a factor of two in 6-D phase space
reduction.

It is recognized that the feasibility of constructing a muon ionization cooling channel is on the critical path to
understanding the viability of the whole muon collider concept. The muon cooling channel is the most novel part of
a muon collider complex. Steady progress has been made both in improving the design of sections of the channel and
in adding detail to the computer simulations. A vigorous experimental program is needed to verify and benchmark
the computer simulations.

The following parts of this section brieﬂy describe the physics underling the process of ionization cooling. We
will show results of simulations for some chosen examples, and outline a six year R&D program to demonstrate the
feasibility of using ionization cooling techniques.

B. Cooling theory

In ionization cooling, the beam loses both transverse and longitudinal momentum as it passes through a material. At
the same time its emittance is increased due to stochastic multiple scattering and Landau straggling. The longitudinal
momentum can be restored by reacceleration, leaving a net loss of transverse momentum.

The approximate equation for transverse cooling in a step ds along the particle’s orbit is [13,18,20,24,142,143]

radiation length of the material. The betatron function is determined by the strengths of the elements in the focusing

lattice [144]. Together with the beam emittance this function determines the local size and divergence of the beam.
Note that the energy loss dEµ/ds is deﬁned here as a positive quantity, unlike the convention often used in particle
physics. The ﬁrst term in this equation is the cooling term, and the second describes the heating due to multiple
scattering. The heating term is minimized if β

is small (strong-focusing) and LR is large (a low-Z absorber).

For a relativistic muon in liquid hydrogen with a betatron focusing value of 8 cm, which corresponds roughly to

where the ﬁrst term describes the cooling (or heating) due to energy loss, and the second term describes the heating
due to straggling. ∆Eµ is the rms spread in the energy of the beam.

Ionization cooling of muons seems relatively straightforward in theory, but will require extensive simulation studies
and hardware development for its optimization. There are practical problems in designing lattices that can transport
and focus the large emittance beam. There will also be eﬀects from space charge and wake ﬁelds.

We have developed a number of tools for studying the ionization cooling process. First, the basic theory was
used to identify the most promising beam properties, material type and focusing arrangements for cooling. Given
the practical limits on magnetic ﬁeld strengths, this gives an estimate of the minimum achievable emittance for a
given conﬁguration. Next, the diﬀerential equations for cooling and heating described above were incorporated into
a computer code. Allowance for the shifts in the betatron phase advance due to space charge and aberrations was
included. This code was used to develop an overall cooling scenario, which broke the cooling system into a number of
stages, and determined the properties of the beam, radio frequency (rf) cavities, and focusing lattice at each stage.

Finally, several tracking codes were either written or modiﬁed to study the cooling process in detail. Two new
codes (SIMUCOOL [145], and ICOOL [146]) use Monte Carlo techniques to track particles one at a time through the
cooling system. All the codes attempt to include all relevant physical processes to some degree, (e.g. energy loss,
straggling, multiple scattering) and use Maxwellian models of the focusing ﬁelds. They do not yet take into account
any space charge or wake ﬁeld eﬀects.
In addition, we have also used a modiﬁed version of PARMELA [147] for
tracking, which does include space charge eﬀects, and a double precision version of GEANT [148,149].

We have recently developed [150] a model of beam cooling based on a second order moment expansion. A computer
code solving the equations for transverse cooling gives results that agree with tracking codes. The code is being
extended to include energy spread and bends. It is very fast and is appropriate for preliminary design and optimization
of the cooling channel. All of these codes are actively being updated and optimized for studying the cooling problem.

C. Cooling system

The cooling is obtained in a series of cooling stages. Each stage consists of a succession of the following components:

1. Transverse cooling sections using materials in a strong focusing (low β

) environment alternated with linear

⊥

accelerators.

2. Emittance exchange in lattices that generate dispersion, with absorbing wedges to reduce momentum spread.

3. Matching sections to optimize the transmission and cooling parameters of the following section.

In the examples that follow it is seen that each such stage lowers the 6-D emittance by a factor of about 2. Since
the required total 6-D cooling is O(106), about 20 such stages are required. The total length of the system would
be of the order of 600 m, and the total acceleration required would be approximately 6 GeV. The fraction of muons
remaining at the end of the cooling system is estimated to be

60%.

The baseline solution for transverse cooling involves the use of liquid hydrogen absorbers in strong solenoid focusing
ﬁelds, interleaved with short linac sections. The solenoidal ﬁelds in successive absorbers are reversed to avoid build up

Three transverse cooling examples have been designed and simulated. The ﬁrst uses 1.25 T solenoids to cool

The baseline solution for emittance exchange involves the use of bent solenoids to generate dispersion and wedges
of hydrogen or LiH to reduce the energy spread. A simulated example is given for exchange that would be needed
after the 15 T transverse cooling case.

A lithium lens solution may prove more economical for the ﬁnal stages, and might allow even lower emittances
to be obtained. In this case, the lithium lens serves simultaneously to maintain the low β
, and provide dE/dx for
cooling. Similar lenses, with surface ﬁelds of 10 T, were developed at Novosibirsk (BINP) and have been used, at
low repetition rates, as focusing elements at FNAL and CERN [7,152–155]. Lenses for the cooling application, which
would operate at 15 Hz, would need to employ ﬂowing liquid lithium to provide adequate thermal cooling. Higher
surface ﬁelds would also be desirable.

⊥

Studies have simulated cooling in multiple lithium lenses, and have shown cooling through several orders of mag-
nitude [11]. But these studies have, so far, used ideal matching and acceleration. Cooling is also being studied in
beam recirculators, which could lead to reduction of costs of the cooling section [156,157], but full simulations with
all higher order eﬀects have not yet been successfully demonstrated.

D. 15 T solenoid transverse cooling example

The lattice consists of 11 identical 2 m long cells. In each cell there is a liquid hydrogen absorber (64 cm long,
10 cm diameter) in the 15 T solenoid focusing magnet (64 cm long, 12 cm diameter). The direction of the ﬁelds in
the magnets alternates from one cell to the next. Between the 15 T solenoids there are magnetic matching sections
(1.3 m long, 32 cm inside diameter) where the ﬁeld is lowered and then reversed. Inside the matching sections are
short, 805 MHz, high gradient (36 MeV/m) linacs. Figure 23 shows the cross section of one cell of such a system,
together with the betatron function, and the magnetic ﬁeld along the axis. For convenience in modeling, the section
shown in Fig. 23(a) starts and ends symmetrically in the middle of hydrogen absorber regions at the location of the
peaks in the axial magnetic ﬁeld. In practice each cell would start at the beginning of the hydrogen region and extend
to the end of the rf module.

A GEANT simulation of muons traversing a section of the cooling channel is shown in Fig. 24.
Additional simulations were performed [151,158] using the program ICOOL. The only likely signiﬁcant eﬀects which
are not yet included are space charge and wakeﬁelds. Analytic calculations for particle bunches in free space indicate
that these eﬀects should, for the later stages, be signiﬁcant but not overwhelming. A full simulation must be done
before we are assured that no problems exist. Particles are introduced with transverse and longitudinal emittance
(186 MeV/c, 1400 π mm-mrad transverse, and 1100 π mm longitudinal), together with a number of naturally occurring
correlations. Firstly, the particles are given the angular momentum appropriate for the starting axial magnetic ﬁeld.
Secondly, particles with large initial radius ro and/or divergence θo have longer pathlengths in a solenoidal ﬁeld and
tend to spread out with time. This can be parameterized by deﬁning an initial transverse amplitude

Figure 25(a) shows the average momentum of the beam as a function of distance along the channel. The momentum
drops as the beam crosses the liquid hydrogen absorbers. The gradient and phase of the rf cavities have been adjusted
so that the reacceleration given to the reference particle equals the mean energy loss. This causes the average
momentum of the beam to remain in a narrow band around 195 MeV/c. Figure 25(b) shows the mechanical and
canonical angular momenta as a function of distance along the channel. The mechanical angular momentum shows
the rotational motion of the beam around the axial solenoidal ﬁeld. It periodically reverses sign when the solenoids
alternate direction. The canonical angular momentum is deﬁned such that it removes the axial ﬁeld dependence [158].

Without the absorbers, the beam would have a constant (0) value for the canonical angular momentum. However,
the presence of absorbers causes the canonical angular momentum to grow and would lead to severe emittance growth
by the end of a long channel. This growth is stopped by alternating the direction of the solenoid ﬁeld, as shown
in Fig. 25(b) Simulations have shown that 2 m is a reasonable (half) period for the ﬁeld, since the net growth in
canonical angular momentum is small. In addition synchrobetatron resonances are avoided since the periodicity of
the ﬁeld forces the average betatron wavelength to be 2 m, whereas the synchrotron oscillation wavelength seen in
the simulations for this arrangement is

14 m.

Figure 26(a) shows the rms and maximum radius of any particle in the beam distribution as a function of distance
along the channel. The rms radius shows that most of the beam is conﬁned to within 2 cm of the axis. The peak
rms radius decreases towards the end of the channel as a result of the cooling. The maximum particle radius is about
8 cm, which determines the radius of the windows required in the rf cavities. Figure 26(b) shows the rms momentum
spread corrected for the correlation between pz and transverse amplitude imposed on the initial particle distribution.
The momentum spread grows as a function of distance since the alternating solenoid system only cools the transverse
emittance. Figure 26(c) shows the rms bunch length s a function of distance along the channel. Again this grows
with distance since this channel does not cool longitudinally.

F. Bent solenoid emittance exchange example

We have been considering using a system that exchanges longitudinal and transverse emittance by exploiting

dispersion in a large acceptance channel, with a low-Z wedge absorber in the region of dispersion.

In a bent solenoid, in the absence of any dipole ﬁeld, there is a drift perpendicular to the bend plane of the center of
the Larmor circular orbit, which is proportional to the particle’s momentum [159]. In our example we have introduced
a uniform dipole ﬁeld over the bend to cancel this drift exactly for particles with the reference momentum. Particles
with momenta diﬀering from the reference momentum then spread out spatially, giving the required dispersion (0.4
m). The dispersion is removed, and the momentum spread reduced, by introducing liquid hydrogen wedges [160].
The hydrogen wedges would be contained by thin beryllium or aluminum foils, but these were not included in this
simulation.

After one bend and one set of wedges, the beam is asymmetric in cross section. Symmetry is restored by a following
bend and wedge system rotated by 90 degrees with respect to the ﬁrst. Figure 28 shows a representation of the two
bends and wedges. The total solenoid length was 8.5 m. The beam tube outside diameter is 20 cm, and the minimum
bend radii is 34 cm.

Figure 29(a) shows the magnetic ﬁelds (Bz, By, and Bx) as a function of the position along the cell. The solenoid
bend curvature is exactly that given by the trajectory of a reference particle (equal in momentum to the average
momenta given in Fig. 29(b)) in the given transverse ﬁelds. The actual shape of the bend turns out to be very
important. Discontinuities in the bend radius can excite perturbations which increase the transverse emittance. We

39

FIG. 28. Representation of a bent solenoid longitudinal emittance exchange section

have shown, for example, that the transverse emittance growth in a bent solenoid depends on discontinuities of the
bend radius as a function of distance, and its ﬁrst and second derivatives, the size and tilt of the solenoidal coils,
auxiliary ﬁelds and the 6-D phase space of the beam. Thus optimization is not straightforward. One solution to this
problem is to have long, adiabatic bends. However, this adds undesirable length to the emittance exchange section.
We are studying options with coupling sections to tight bends roughly half a Larmor length long, which seems to
minimize transverse emittance growth while also minimizing the length of the section. Due to similar problems,
the length and longitudinal distribution of the wedge material has also been found to aﬀect emittance growth. For
example, the growth can be minimized when the vector sum of the Larmor phases at the absorber elements is small
or zero.

The simulations were performed using the program ICOOL. The maximum beam radius is 10 cm. Transmission was
100%. Figure 30(a) shows the rms longitudinal momentum spread relative to the reference momentum as a function
of the position along the cell. The fractional spread decreases from an initial value of approximately 5%, to a ﬁnal
value of approximately 2.2%. At the same time, since this is an emittance exchange, the transverse beam area grows,
as shown in Fig. 30(b). One notes that the area increases not only in the regions of bends (region 1 and 8), but also
in the regions of wedges (2-6 and 9-11). This is probably due to failures in matching that have yet to be understood.
Figure 31 shows scatter plots of the transverse particle positions against their momenta. The dispersion is clearly
observed in Fig. 31(b) (after the ﬁrst bend) and in Fig. 31(e) (after the second). It is seen to be removed, with a
corresponding decrease in momentum spread, in Fig. 31(c) (after the ﬁrst set of wedges) and Fig. 31(f) (after the
second set of wedges).

Figure 32 shows a scatterplot of the square of the particle radii vs. their longitudinal momenta, (a) at the start,
and (b) at the end of the emittance exchange section. The decrease in momentum spread and rise in beam area are
clearly evident.

The initial and ﬁnal beam parameters are given in table VII. Although this example demonstrate a factor of
3
reduction in the longitudinal momentum spread, there is a 37 % increase in the 5-D phase space. The simulations
must be extended to include rf so that the 6-D emittance can be studied and the emittance exchange section can be
optimized.

Emittance exchange in solid LiH wedges, with ideal dispersion and matching, has also been successfully simulated
using SIMUCOOL [161]. Dispersion generation by weak focusing spectrometers [156] and dipoles with solenoids [162]

G. RF for the cooling systems

The losses in the longitudinal momentum of the muon beam from the cooling media have to be restored using rf
acceleration sections. These rf structures are embedded in solenoidal ﬁelds that reverse direction within each section.
In the two transverse cooling examples above, the rf frequency is 805 MHz and the peak gradient is 36 MeV/m. The
magnetic ﬁelds that extend over the cavities vary from 0 to 10 T, reversing in the center. It should be pointed out
that in the earlier stages, the bunches are longer, and lower frequencies will be required.

FIG. 33. Two full cell sections plus two half cell sections of the interleaved π/2 mode accelerating cavities. The volumes

labeled C are powered separately from the volumes labeled D.

In order to realize maximum accelerating gradients within the acceleration cavities, we take advantage of the
penetrating properties of a muon beam by placing thin windows between each rf cell, thereby creating an accelerating
structure closely approximating the classic pill-box cavity. This permits operating conditions in which the axial
accelerating ﬁeld is equal to the maximum wall ﬁeld and gives a high shunt impedance.

The windows in the 15 T example are 16 cm diameter, 125 µm thick Be foils. In the 31 T case, they are 10 cm

diameter and 50 µm thick.

For these rf structures, we will use an interleaved cavity design in which two parts are independently powered
(Fig. 33). The mode of the system will be referred to as π/2 interleaved. Each section supports a standing wave π
mode, with each acceleration cell π/2 long, giving a good transit time factor. To reduce the peak rf power requirements
(by a factor of 2), we are considering operating the cells at liquid nitrogen temperatures.

The characteristics of the rf systems currently being studied are summarized in Table VIII. Figure 34 shows a full

1.3 m section with interleaved cavities. Each cell is 8.1 cm in length and the 1.3 m section consists of 16 cells.

H. The liquid lithium lens

The ﬁnal cooling element ultimately determines the luminosity of the collider. In order to obtain smaller transverse
emittance as the muon beam travels down the cooling channel, the focusing strength must increase, i.e. the β
’s
must decrease. A current within a conductor produces an active lens absorber, which can maintain the beam at small
β
throughout an extended absorber length, while simultaneously attenuating the beam momentum. An active lens
absorber, such as a lithium lens, may prove to be the most eﬃcient cooling element for the ﬁnal stages.

⊥

⊥

The cooling power of a Li lens is illustrated in Figure 35, where the x vs. px phase space distributions at the
beginning and at the end of the absorber are shown. This example corresponds to a 1 m long lens, with 1 cm
radius, and a surface ﬁeld of 10 T. The beam momentum entering the lens was 267 MeV/c, with Gaussian transverse
spatial and momentum distributions: σx = σy = 2.89 mm, σpx = σpy = 26.7 MeV/c, and a normalized emittance
of ǫx,N = 710 mm-mrad. The normalized emittance at the end of the absorber was ǫx,N = 450 mm-mrad (cooling
1.57), and the ﬁnal beam momentum was 159 MeV/c. The results were obtained using a detailed GEANT
factor
simulation of a single stage.

∼

An alternative cooling scheme under study uses a series of Li lenses. The lens parameters would have to vary to
match the changing beam emittance along the section and in addition, acceleration of the beam between the lenses
has to be included.

Lithium lenses have been used with high reliability as focusing elements at FNAL and CERN [7,153,154]. Although
these lenses have many similar properties to those required for ionization cooling, there are some very crucial diﬀerences

which will require signiﬁcant advances in lens technology: ionization cooling requires longer lenses (

Increasing J is obviously desirable. Decreasing p can also be useful. However, below about 250 MeV/c the slope
of dE
dx (E) tends to increase the longitudinal emittance. The requirement for the highest current density causes large
ohmic power deposition. The current density will be limited by the maximum tolerable deposited energy, which will
produce instantaneous heating, expansion, and pressure eﬀects. Understanding these eﬀects is part of the ongoing
liquid Li lens R&D.

The structural design of the lithium lens is determined by how the pressure pulse and heat deposition are handled.
We assume that the Li will be ﬂowing rapidly under high pressure, conﬁned by electrical insulators radially and by
fairly thick Be windows longitudinally. Operation at 15 Hz for long periods poses severe challenges. Shock, fatigue and
other failure modes are being evaluated, in addition to studies of material compatibilities, corrosion and degradation
to insure safe operation over long periods. It seems that the minimum required radius of the lens may be the most
important parameter to determine, since mechanical problems rise while losses decrease as a function of radius.

Transferring the beam from one lens to another, with linacs to reaccelerate and provide longitudinal focusing, is
also a challenging problem, because of the multiple scattering introduced in the windows, straggling and the large
divergence of the beams. We are in the process of evaluating a number of designs for this transfer channel, using
detailed tracking simulations that include solenoids, quadrupoles and other focusing elements together with Li lenses.
A group from BINP has designed, and is constructing, a 15 cm long liquid lithium lens prototype that will eventually
be tested at FNAL. It is planned to extend this R&D program to design, construct, and test longer lenses. The design
of two lenses, whose behavior will be tested at ﬁrst on a bench and then with muon beams at the Ionization Cooling
Demonstration Facility, will then follow [163].

I. Ionization cooling experimental R&D

An R&D program has been proposed to design and prototype the critical sections of a muon ionization cooling
channel. The goal of this experimental R&D program is to develop the muon ionization cooling hardware to the point
where a complete ionization cooling channel can be conﬁdently designed for the First Muon Collider. Details can be
found in Fermilab proposal P904 [163]. A summary of the R&D program can be found in ref. [164].

The proposed R&D program consists of:

Developing an appropriate rf re-acceleration structure. It is proposed to construct a 3-cell prototype rf cavity
with thin beryllium windows, which will be tested at high power and within a high-ﬁeld solenoid.

Prototyping initially a 2 m section, and eventually a 10 m section, of an alternating solenoid transverse cooling
stage. It is proposed to test the performance of these sections in a muon beam of the appropriate momentum.

Prototyping an emittance exchange (wedge) section and measuring its performance in a muon beam of the
appropriate momentum.

The measurements that are needed to demonstrate the cooling capability and optimize the design of the alternating
solenoid, wedge, and lithium lens cooling stages will require the construction and operation of an ionization cooling
test facility. This facility will need

1. a muon beam with a central momentum that can be chosen in the range 100-300 MeV/c,

2. an experimental area that can accommodate a cooling and instrumentation setup of initially

30 m in length,

3. instrumentation to precisely measure the positions of the incoming and outgoing particles in 6-D phase space

and eventually up to

50 m in length, and

and conﬁrm that they are muons.

In the initial design shown in Fig. 36, the instrumentation consists of identical measuring systems before and after the
cooling apparatus [165]. Each measuring system consists of (a) an upstream time measuring device to determine the
arrival time of the particles to one quarter of an rf cycle (
300 ps), (b) an upstream momentum spectrometer in
which the track trajectories are measured by low pressure TPC’s on either side of a bent solenoid, (c) an accelerating
rf cavity to change the particles momentum by an amount that depends on its arrival time, (d) a downstream
momentum spectrometer, which is identical to the upstream spectrometer, and together with the rf cavity and the
upstream spectrometer forms a precise time measurement system with a precision of a few ps. The measuring systems
are 8 m long, and are contained within a high-ﬁeld solenoidal channel to keep the beam particles within the acceptance
of the cooling apparatus.

∼ ±

It is proposed to accomplish this ionization cooling R&D program in a period of about 6 years. At the end of this
period we believe that it will be possible to assess the feasibility and cost of constructing an ionization cooling channel
for the First Muon Collider, and if it proves feasible, begin a detailed design of the complete cooling channel.

Following cooling and initial bunch compression, the beams must be rapidly accelerated. In this section some of

the options in accelerator design will be described and examples of acceleration scenarios presented.

Separate acceleration scenarios are given here for a low momentum spread 100 GeV First Muon Collider (Higgs
factory), and for a high luminosity 3 TeV collider. Ideally, though more diﬃcult, this accelerator designed for the low
energy machine should be extendable to the
2 TeV beam energy
needed for a very high-energy collider.

VI. ACCELERATION

A. Introduction

46

FIG. 36. Schematic of the cooling test apparatus arrangement.

While acceleration of muons to high energy is clearly possible, an optimal and cost-eﬀective acceleration complex
is needed. In the scenarios described below, a low-frequency linac would take the beam from the end of cooling to
an energy of
1 GeV followed by recirculating-linac systems to take the beam to 50-70 GeV. The multi-TeV energy
regime can be reached through a series of very rapid cycling synchrotrons. Variations on the acceleration model and
potential diﬃculties are discussed, including the use of Fixed Field Alternating Gradient (FFAG) accelerators in place
of, or together with, the recirculating-linacs. Finally, topics for further study and research are described.

≈

The acceleration time is limited by muon decay (τµ = 2.2µ s at rest) and requires that:

B. Accelerator options

eV ′rf >> 0.16MeV/m

where eV ′rf is the acceleration rate. An acceleration rate whose value of 0.16 MeV/m is low for a linac, but very high
for a conventional synchrotron.

At the lowest energies (< 700 MeV), the momentum spread and beam sizes are so large that only a linac is feasible,

and acceleration to full energy in a single-pass linac would be good, but it would be very expensive.

Thus, following the initial linac, some form of recirculating acceleration is preferred. A synchrotron would be
possible, in principle, but the acceleration must occur so rapidly that conventional magnet ramping is unlikely to be
practical. Two alternative multi pass methods are being considered: recirculating linac accelerators similar to those
used at TJNAF and Fixed Field Alternating Gradient (FFAG) accelerators.

In a recirculating linac accelerator, the beam is circulated through the same linac for several passes, with separate,
energy matched, ﬁxed-ﬁeld return paths for each pass. Each return path is optically independent and can be separately
designed. In the initial lattice design for the muon recirculating linac accelerator, the return arcs are similar alternating
gradient (AG) systems with the same dipole layout, but with diﬀering quadrupole strengths to allow separate tuning
and chronicity matching in each arc. Multiple aperture superconducting magnets have also been designed which would

47

≈

reduce the diameter of the recirculating linac, lowering muon loss from decay and possibly being more economical (see
Fig 7.12 [44]). In either case, both the linac and return transports must accommodate large transverse emittances
300 π mm-mrad. Strong focusing is required not only to keep apertures down, but also to minimize orbit
(rms) of
deviations due to the large momentum spreads, which in the initial stages of acceleration, can be as large as 10% rms.
More recently, an adaptation of the FFAG (Fixed-Field Alternating Gradient) accelerator concept has been proposed
for µ+ µ
acceleration [166,167]. In this variation, return transports are designed with a very large (factor of 5-10)
energy acceptance, so that separate energy turns can pass through the same ﬁxed-ﬁeld elements. More acceleration
turns are possible than with a recirculating linac accelerator which reduces the rf requirements; but the orbits and
focusing properties are now energy-dependent. Such FFAG conﬁgurations require strong superconducting magnets
with large apertures to accommodate the energy-dependent spread in closed orbits. The extra cost associated with
increased magnet apertures must be evaluated against potential savings in the number of magnets and reduced rf/turn
requirements.

−

For the higher energy stages, the muon life time is greater and the needed rate of energy increase is less. Thus,
above a few hundred GeV, rapid accelerating synchrotrons become possible. In a rapid accelerating synchrotron, the
beam is also multi-pass accelerated through an rf system, but the beam returns in a single arc, as the magnetic ﬁeld is
ramped to match the increase in beam energy. As above, more acceleration turns are possible than with a recirculating
accelerator, but we now have a single moderate aperture return transport. But rapid cycling synchrotrons have higher
power costs and the technical challenges associated with the rapid acceleration time needed to conserve muons.

Thus a complete system would likely include an initial linac followed by a sequence of recirculating linac acceler-
ators and/or Fixed Field Alternating Gradient machines. Depending on the ﬁnal collider energy, one or more rapid
acceleration synchrotrons would follow. Each system increases the beam energy by a factor of 5-10.

C. Scenario examples

Several scenarios have been discussed earlier [168,169], see for instance the parameters (table XI) used in a simulation
of longitudinal motion discussed below. The ones given here are more recent, and more detailed, but they should
not be taken to be deﬁnitive. They are examples that were derived to probe the design problems and to show that
solutions should be possible.

1. Acceleration for Higgs collider

Table IX gives an example of a sequence of accelerators for a 100 GeV Higgs Factory, i.e. a machine with very low

≈

momentum spread (0.003%, see table I) and relatively large rms transverse emittance (

300 π mm-mrad).

Following initial linacs, recirculating accelerators are used. The number of arcs in each recirculating accelerator
is about 10. In this example, conventional ﬁxed ﬁeld 2 T magnets are used, but the eﬀective ramp frequencies that
would be needed if pulsed magnets were used are given for reference.

In this example, all the accelerating cavities are room temperature copper structures, and the accelerating gradients
are modest (< 10 MeV/m). Nevertheless, the acceleration is rapid enough that the total losses from decay are only
30%. The heating from these decays is also modest (
10 W/m) because of the small number of turns and relatively
low energy. Since no superconducting magnets or rf are used in this example, this heating should cause no problem.
In this machine, the transverse emittances are large and strong focusing is thus required, but the maximum mo-

≈

mentum spread is moderate (up to 1.37 rms in the ﬁrst recirculator) and is thus not likely to be a problem.

If the same machine is to also run at a high luminosity, with larger momentum spread, then although the six
dimensional emittance is the same as in the Higgs collider discussed above, the transverse emittance is smaller
(
90π mm-mrad rms ), and the longitudinal emittance larger (by about a factor of 4) and the momentum spread in
≈
the ﬁrst recirculating accelerator would be nearly 6% rms; or about 50% full width. This is a very large momentum
spread that could only be accepted in FFAG like lattices as discussed below.

Similarly, if the same acceleration is to be usable as the front end for a 250 + 250 GeV or higher energy machine
then the transverse emittance will again be less, the longitudinal emittance even larger, and the problem of very large
momentum spread will be worse. Clearly, although not absolutely needed for a Higgs Factory, it is desirable to solve
this problem even in that First Collider.

A separate parameter set for the high luminosity 50 + 50 GeV collider and a 250 + 250 GeV collider could have
been presented, but their parameters are very similar to those of the front end of the 3 TeV machine given below,
and are thus omitted here.

2. Acceleration for 3 TeV collider

For a high energy machine, the muon accelerators are physically the largest component and are also probably
the most expensive. More work is needed on its design. Table X gives an early example of a possible sequence of
accelerators for a 3 TeV collider.

Linacs are used up to 700 MeV, followed by recirculating linac accelerators. In the ﬁrst of these, because of the
very large longitudinal emittance, the momentum spread as the beam enters the ﬁrst recirculating linac accelerator
is 8.5% rms, which is very large. The lattice must have very strong focusing, small dispersion and large aperture. If
this is not possible, higher energy linacs or lower frequency rf could relieve the requirement.

For the ﬁnal three stages, pulsed magnet synchrotrons [170] are used. In the 200 GeV ring, all the magnets in the
ring are pulsed, but in the last two rings a superconducting-pulsed hybrid solution is used. In these cases, if only
pulsed magnets were used, then the power consumed would be too high, and because only low pulsed ﬁelds could
be used, the circumferences would also be very large. It is thus proposed to use rings with alternating warm pulsed
magnets and superconducting ﬁxed magnets [171] (see ﬁgure 37). The ﬁxed magnets are superconducting at 8 T; the
pulsed magnets are warm with ﬁelds that swing from - 2 T to + 2 T. The eﬀective ramp frequency is given in the
table. Both of these rings are in the same tunnel, with the fraction of magnet length pulsed (vs. ﬁxed) being diﬀerent
(73% and 43%).

In all the ﬁnal three rings superconducting rf is employed to minimize the peak power requirements and to obtain
high wall to beam eﬃciency and thus keep the wall power consumption reasonable. In the ﬁnal two rings the frequency
and cavity designs are chosen to be the same as that in the TESLA [172] proposal.

D. Design issues

1. Recirculating linac accelerator lattice issues

Beam transport R&D for recirculating linac accelerators follows the model of the Thomas Jeﬀerson National Accel-
erator Facility (TJNAF). The layout is a racetrack with linacs in the straight sections and multi-pass return arcs. At
the ends of the linacs the multi-pass beam lines are recombined. A pulse magnet at each separation/recombination
point is used to guide the beam into the energy matched return arc. Some initial lattice design concepts for recir-
culating linac accelerators are being developed. The basic return arc unit would be a FODO lattice, but with the
quadrupole strengths varied in order to perturb the arc dispersion function and obtain nearly isochronous motion
around the arcs. The arcs are dispersion matched by setting the arc phase advance to a multiple of 2π. Arc designs
based upon the ﬂexible momentum compaction (FMC) module can also be used.

In the special case of the very low momentum spread Higgs factory, the transverse emittances are very large
300 π mm-mrad rms), and will require strong focusing in the lattices. Momentum acceptance in the rings is, in
(
≈
this case, not a problem. But the longitudinal phase space of the muons in the other machines is much larger and
requires, at low energies, either long bunches, or large momentum spreads. The requirement of high accelerating
gradients argues for high frequencies, and thus short bunches. One therefore needs accelerators with large momentum
acceptances.

In the 3 TeV example above, the acceptance at injection into the ﬁrst recirculating accelerator is 8.5% rms. This is
very large by conventional standards, but far less than that in the FFAG lattices being studied [166]. Thus the early
return arcs of such a recirculating linac accelerator would have to have very strong focusing, and be FFAG-like. Of
course, if a true FFAG accelerator were to be used for its avoidance of the switchyards and multi-aperture magnets,
then the speciﬁed momentum spread would certainly not be a problem.

Permanent, ferric or superferric (

2 T), or high ﬁeld superconducting magnets could be used for recirculating linac
accelerators. The lower ﬁeld magnets may be economic for initial turns, while high ﬁeld magnets minimize particle
travel times, and therefore decay losses. Designs for multi-aperture superconducting magnets suitable for recirculating
linac accelerators have been developed [44], and superconducting magnets with as many as 18 apertures with 0.7–7 T
ﬁelds have been designed. A variety of magnet conﬁgurations can be developed; cost/performance optimization will
be needed in developing a ﬁnal choice.

2. RF peak power requirements

Because of the need for rapid acceleration, the peak rf powers are high, and the resulting numbers of power
sources large. For the linacs and early recirculating accelerators, the powers are high because of the high gradients
and low frequencies needed to accelerate the long bunches. At these frequencies (
200 MHz), currently available
sources (triodes and tetrodes) have relatively low maximum output powers and are expensive. Low temperature
operation of the cavities, and superconducting or conventional SLED [173] systems, which would reduce the peak
power requirements, are being considered.

≈

Study of the example suggests that in the ﬁrst two recirculators (up to 7 GeV) there is no hope for the rf to keep
up with the beam loading. The cavity can only be ﬁlled in a suitable ﬁlling time (twice the time constant in these
examples), and the rf voltage allowed to sag as the beam makes its multiple passes. If excessive sensitivity to beam
current is to be avoided, then the stored energy must be large compared to that used, which is somewhat ineﬃcient.
In the ﬁnal recirculating accelerator, continuous ﬁlling (cw) is just possible, but requires yet higher peak power
5 GW total at 400 MHz) because of the high acceleration rate. The use of superconducting cavities can reduce
(
≈
losses, and thus reduce this peak rf power source requirement, and was included in the above 3 TeV example. At this
frequency (400 MHz), klystrons are available with greater power (
20 MW) than that of the sources at the lower
frequencies, but a yet higher power klystron (50-100 MW) could probably be developed and would be desirable.

3. Pulsed magnet systems

A pulsed current 4 T magnet has been designed for acceleration to 250 GeV in 360 µs [174], but eﬃciency favors
use of ferric materials in rapid acceleration magnets, although this would limit peak magnetic ﬁelds to
2 T. The
average ﬁeld can be increased by interleaving magnets swinging from -2 T to 2 T with ﬁxed ﬁeld 8 T superconducting
magnets.

≈

Faster pulsing magnets would require special materials to minimize energy losses from eddy currents. Options
include silicon steel, metglass laminations, or ﬁnemet laminated tape or powdered solid. A 30µm metglass lamination
suitable for several kHz cycling has been developed. A design of suitable pulsed magnets [171](see Fig. 38) has been
shown to have suﬃciently low losses for this application. The magnets employ cables made of many ﬁne insulated
strands (litz cable) and the yokes are made of very thin (0.28 mm), 3% Si-Fe laminations, possibly of metglas [175,176]
for the higher rate cases. Detailed designs must be developed and prototypes constructed and the practical limits of
recycling scenarios should be determined.

FIG. 38. A 2-D picture of an H frame magnet lamination with grain oriented 3% Si-Fe steel.The arrows show both the

magnetic ﬁeld and the grain direction.

4. Superconducting linacs

While the gradients needed in the acceleration systems are not excessive, they are larger than previous experience
at the lower frequencies. The high peak power pulsed operation poses power handling diﬃculties at lower energies and
high peak current presents collective eﬀect (wakeﬁeld) diﬃculties at higher energies. Higher gradients and eﬃciencies
in all sections would improve performance.

The superconducting rf would operate in pulsed mode, matched to the acceleration time of up to a few ms. This
pulse structure is similar to the multibunch acceleration mode planned for TESLA (25 MV/m at 1300 MHz designs),
and studies indicate that this design could be adapted to µ+
µ− acceleration. At lower frequencies, structures such
as the CERN 350 MHz superconducting rf cavities could be used. These cavities have been tested in pulsed mode
operation, and tests indicate that pulsed acceleration ﬁelds > 10 MV/m are possible [177].

−

The high single bunch intensities required for high intensities imply large higher order mode losses and large wakeﬁeld
eﬀects from the short, high intensity bunches. Higher order mode (HOM) load designs adapted from superconducting
1/2, where a
rf experience could be used. HOM loads and wakeﬁelds are expected to vary as a−
is the cavity aperture, λ is the acceleration wavelength and σ is the bunch length [178,179]. Calculations indicate
1012 with 1300 MHz superconducting rf in a recirculating
that the wakeﬁelds would limit bunch intensities to
×
linac accelerator scenario. The longitudinal dynamics is microtron-like or synchrotron-like and oﬀ-crest acceleration
enables compensation of the linear part of the wakeﬁelds, with synchrotron-like phase stability [168].

A study [169] followed the longitudinal motion of particles through a similar sequence of recirculating accelerators
(see table XI). Cavities similar to those proposed for TESLA [172] were assumed. Figure 39 shows, after optimization

F. Acceleration research needed

As discussed above, possible acceleration conﬁgurations have been developed, and critical longitudinal motion
simulations have been performed. These calculations support the general feasibility of acceleration of muons from
cooling to collider energies. However the designs of acceleration systems have not been fully detailed and much work
would be needed to obtain a buildable design. Complete transport lattices for linacs and return arcs have not yet been
derived, and 6-D phase space tracking of beams through the accelerators has not been attempted. Also the geometry
of combining and separating multi pass beams has not been worked out and optimized.

The rf requirements and systems have been speciﬁed at only the rudimentary requirements level, and have not
been developed to a constructible level. Optimal conﬁgurations and choices of normal or superconducting rf must be
developed, as well as more optimal choices in acceleration frequencies. The simple wakeﬁeld models used in the initial
simulations should be expanded to obtain more realistic systems, and more precise calculations of wakeﬁeld eﬀects
must be developed.

Rapid accelerating systems have only been outlined at the simplest conceptual level. Prototype magnet design and
testing are needed to test the limits of cycling rate and ﬁeld strengths. Successful magnet concepts must then be
speciﬁed in terms of stable beam transport conﬁgurations, including focusing and transport matching. While beam
is stored for only a few turns, the individual bunch intensities are large enough that the possibility of single bunch
instabilities must be considered and calculated. The larger number of passes in a recirculating linac accelerator places
greater demands on the rf systems and higher order mode (HOM) loads, particularly for superconducting systems.

VII. COLLIDER STORAGE RING

A. Introduction

After one µ+ bunch and one µ− bunch have been accelerated to collision energy, the two bunches are injected into
the collider ring, which is a ﬁxed ﬁeld storage ring. Parameters for several possible collider storage rings are given in
table I. Collider ring lattices have been developed for two of the collision energies in this table: 100 GeV and 3 TeV
in the center of mass.

Three operational modes are proposed in the above table for the 100 GeV collider, each requiring diﬀerent machine
optics. The following sections discuss a 100 GeV collider lattice for two of the modes, the broad momentum spread

case (∆p/p of 0.12%, rms) and the narrow momentum spread case (∆p/p of 0.003%), as well as a 3 TeV collider
lattice.

Stringent criteria have been imposed on the collider lattice designs in order to attain the speciﬁed luminosities. The
ﬁrst and most diﬃcult criterion to satisfy is provision of an Interaction Region (IR) with extremely low β∗ values at
the collision point consistent with acceptable dynamic aperture. The required β∗ values for the 100 GeV collider are
4 cm for the broad momentum spread case and 14 cm for the narrow momentum spread case. For the 3 TeV machine,
β∗ is only 3 mm. These β∗ values were tailored to match the longitudinal bunch lengths in order to avoid luminosity
dilution from the hour-glass eﬀect. Achieving this requirement in the 3 TeV lattice is complicated by the high peak
beta function values in the ﬁnal focus quadrupoles requiring 8-10 cm radial apertures. The correspondingly weakened

gradients combined with the ultra-high energy make for a long ﬁnal focus structure. (In contrast, the lower energy
and larger β∗ values in the 100 GeV collider lead to an eﬃcient, compact ﬁnal focus telescope.) Compounding the
problem, particularly for the 3 TeV design, is the need to protect the superconducting coils from the decay products
of the muons. Placing a tungsten shield between the vacuum chamber and the coils can increase the radial aperture
in the 3 TeV quadrupoles by as much as 6 cm, lowering available gradients still further. Final focus designs must
also include collimators and background sweep dipoles, and other provisions for protecting the magnets and detectors
from muon decay electrons. Eﬀective schemes have been incorporated into the current lattices.

Another diﬃcult constraint imposed on the lattice is that of isochronicity. A high degree of isochronicity is required
in order to maintain the short bunch structure without excessive rf voltage. In the lattices presented here, control
over the momentum compaction is achieved through appropriate design of the arcs.

A ﬁnal criterion especially important in the lower energy colliders is that the ring circumference be as small as
feasible in order to minimize luminosity degradation through decay of the muons. Achieving small circumference
requires high ﬁelds in the bending magnets as well as a compact, high dipole packing fraction design. To meet
the small circumference demand, 8 T pole tip ﬁelds have been assumed for all superconducting magnets, with the
exception of the 3 TeV ﬁnal focus quadrupoles, whose pole tips are assumed to be as high as 12 T. In addition, design
studies for still higher ﬁeld dipoles are in progress.

The rf requirements depend on the momentum compaction of the lattice and on the parameters of the muon
bunch. For the case of very low momentum spread, synchrotron motion is negligible and the rf system is used solely
to correct an energy spread generated through the impedance of the machine. For the cases of higher momentum
spreads, there are two approaches. One is to make the momentum compaction zero to high order through lattice
design. Then the synchrotron motion can be eliminated, and the rf is again only needed to compensate the induced
energy spread correction. Alternatively, if some momentum compaction is retained, then a more powerful rf system
is needed to maintain the speciﬁed short bunches. In either case, rf quadrupoles will be required to generate BNS
[180,181] damping of the transverse head-tail instability.

3. 3 TeV CoM lattice

The 3 TeV ring has a roughly racetrack design with two circular arcs separated by an experimental insertion on
one side, and a utility insertion for injection, extraction, and beam scraping on the other. The experimental insertion
includes the interaction region (IR) followed by a local chromatic correction section (CCS) and a matching section.
The chromatic correction section is optimized to correct the ring’s linear chromaticity, which is mostly generated by
the low beta quadrupoles in the IR. In designs of e+e− colliders, it has been found that local chromatic correction of
the ﬁnal focus is essential [182–185], as was found to be the case here. The 3 TeV IR and CCS are displayed in Fig. 40.
The accompanying 3 TeV arc module in Fig 41 is an example of a module which controls momentum compaction (i.e.
isochronicity) of the entire ring.

4. 100 GeV CoM lattices

For the 100 GeV CoM collider [186], two operating modes are contemplated: a high luminosity case with broad
0.12% (rms), and one with a much narrower
momentum acceptance to accommodate a beam with a ∆p/p of
0.003% (rms). For the broad momentum
momentum acceptance and lower luminosity for a beam with ∆p/p of
acceptance case, β∗ must be 4 cm and for the narrow momentum acceptance case, 14 cm.
In either case, the
bunch length must be held comparable to the value of β∗. The 100 GeV ring geometry is highly compact and more
complicated than a racetrack, but the lattice has regions with the same functions as those of the 3 TeV ring.

±

±

Two independent 100 GeV lattice designs have evolved; these are described below in separate sections and denoted
Example (a) and Example (b), respectively. The ﬁrst design described is a lattice which has two optics modes. In
the high luminosity mode, the β∗ value is 4 cm with a transverse and momentum aperture suﬃcient to accept a
normalized beam emittance of 90π (rms) and a ∆p/p of
0.12% (rms). The second, lower luminosity mode has a
±
β∗ value of 14 cm with a very large transverse acceptance, but small, approximately monochromatic, momentum
acceptance.

FIG. 40. Example (a): 3 TeV IR and chromatic correction.

The second 100 GeV lattice described is another collider design with a 4 cm β∗ optics mode. Although the number
of magnets diﬀer between the two lattices, the most important optics diﬀerence between the two is in the modules

5. 100 GeV CoM. Example (a)

The need for diﬀerent collision modes in the 100 GeV machine led to an Interaction Region design with two optics
modes: one with broad momentum acceptance (∆p/p of 0.12%, rms) and a collision β∗ of 4 cm, and the other
basically monochromatic (∆p/p of 0.003%, rms) and a larger collision β∗ of 14 cm. The ﬁrst lattice design, denoted
Example (a), shown in Fig. 42 and Fig. 43, has a total circumference of about 350 m with arc modules accounting for
only about a quarter of the ring circumference.

∗

The low beta function values at the IP are mainly produced by three strong superconducting quadrupoles in the
Final Focus Telescope (FFT) with pole tip ﬁelds of 8 T. The full interaction region is symmetric under reﬂection
about the interaction point (IP). Because of signiﬁcant, large angle backgrounds from muon decay, a background
sweep dipole is included in the ﬁnal focus telescope and placed near the IP to protect the detector and the low β
quadrupoles [187]. It was found that this sweep dipole, 2.5 m long with an 8 T ﬁeld, provides suﬃcient background
suppression. The ﬁrst quadrupole is located 5 m away from the interaction point, and the beta functions reach a
maximum value of 1.5 km in the ﬁnal focus telescope, when the maxima of the beta functions in both planes are
equalized. For this maximum beta value, the quadrupole apertures must be at least 11 cm in radius to accommodate
5 σ of a 90 π mm-mrad, 50 GeV muon beam (normalized rms emittance) plus a 2 to 3 cm thick tungsten liner [188].
The natural chromaticity of this interaction region is about

60.

Local chromatic correction of the muon collider interaction region is required to achieve broad momentum accep-
tance. The basic approach developed by Brown [183] and others [189], is implemented in the Chromatic Correction
Region (CC). The CC contains two pairs of sextupoles, one pair for each transverse plane, all located at locations
with high dispersion. The sextupoles of each pair are located at positions of equal, high beta value in the plane
(horizontal or vertical) whose chromaticity is to be corrected, and very low beta waist in the other plane. Moreover,
the two sextupoles of each pair are separated by a betatron phase advance of near π, and each sextupole has a phase
separation of (2n + 1) π
2 from the IP, where n is an integer. The result of this arrangement is that the geometric
aberrations of each sextupole is canceled by its companion while the chromaticity corrections add.

FIG. 43. Example (a): 14 cm β∗ Mode showing half of the IR, local chromatic correction, and one of three arc modules.

The sextupoles of each pair are centered about a minimum in the opposite plane (βmin < 1m), which provides
chromatic correction with minimal cross correlation between the planes. A further advantage to locating the opposite
plane’s minimum at the center of the sextupole, is that this point is π
2 away from, or “out of phase” with, the source
of chromatic eﬀects in the ﬁnal focus quadrupoles; i.e the plane not being chromatically corrected is treated like the
IP in terms of phase to eliminate a second order chromatic aberration generated by an “opposite-plane” sextupole.

In this lattice example, the CC (Fig. 44) was optimized to be as short as possible. The βmax is only 100 m and
the βmin = 0.7 m, giving a βratio between planes of about 150, so the dynamic aperture is not compromised by a
large amplitude dependent tuneshift.

This large beta ratio, combined with the opposite plane phasing, allows the sextupoles for the opposite planes to
be interleaved, without signiﬁcantly increasing the nonlinearity of the lattice. In fact, interleaving improved lattice
performance compared to that of a non-interleaved correction scheme, due to a shortening of the chromatic correction
section, which lowers its chromaticity contribution [190]. The use of somewhat shallower beta minima with less
variation in beta through the sextupoles was made soften the chromatic aberrations, although this caused a slight
violation of the exact π phase advance separation between sextupole partners. The retention of an exact π phase
advance diﬀerence between sextupoles was found to be less important to the dynamic aperture than elimination of
minima with βmin < 0.5 m.

The total momentum compaction contributions of the IR, CC, and matching sections is about 0.04. The total length
of these parts is 173 m, while that of the the momentum compaction correcting arc is 93 m. From these numbers,
it follows that this arc must have a negative momentum compaction of about
0.09 in order to oﬀset the positive
contributions from the rest of the ring.

−

The arc module is shown in Fig. 45. It has the small beta functions characteristic of FODO cells, yet a large,
almost separate, variability in the momentum compaction of the module which is a characteristic associated with the
ﬂexible momentum compaction module [191,192]. The small beta functions are achieved through the use of a doublet
focusing structure which produces a low beta simultaneously in both planes. At the dual minima, a strong focusing
quadrupole is placed to control the derivative of dispersion with little impact on the beta functions. Negative values
of momentum compaction as low as α =
0.13 have been achieved, and γt = 2 i, has been achieved with modest
values of the beta function.

−

This arc module was able to generate the needed negative momentum compaction with beta functions of 40 m or

less.

in the 4 cm β∗ mode would result in a linear lattice with a large transverse aperture. With only linear elements, the
4 cm β∗ optics was found to be strongly nonlinear with limited on-momentum dynamic acceptance.

A normal form analysis using COSY INFINITY [193] showed that the variation of tune shift with amplitude was
large, which was the source of the strong nonlinearity in the seemingly linear lattice. To locate the source of this
nonlinearity, a lattice consisting of the original IR and arcs only (no CC), was studied. Numerical studies conﬁrmed
similar dynamic aperture and variation of tune shift with amplitude. This ruled out the possibility that the dynamic
aperture was limited by the low beta points in the local chromatic correction section and points to the IR as the
source of the nonlinearity. These ﬁndings were also veriﬁed [194] using a Runge-Kutta integrator to track through the
IR and a linear matrix for the rest of the lattice. Further analytical study using perturbation theory showed that the
ﬁrst order contribution to the tune shift with amplitude is proportional to γ2
x,y and γxγy, which are large in this IR.
These terms come from the nonlinear terms of px/p0 and py/p0, which, to ﬁrst order, equal the angular divergence of
a particle. As a demonstration, a comparison to the LHC low beta IR was done. Taking into account only the drift
from the IP to the ﬁrst quadrupole, the horizontal detuning at 10σ of the present IR (β∗ = 4 cm) is 0.01, whereas
the detuning of the entire LHC lattice is below 1E-4. This also explains the fact that the on-momentum aperture of
the wide momentum spread mode remains roughly constant despite various versions and correction attempts.

It was therefore concluded and later shown that the dynamic aperture of the more relaxed β∗ of 14 cm would
not have the same strong nonlinearities due to the reduced angular terms. In fact, the variation of tune shift with
amplitude was less by an order of magnitude; hence the large transverse acceptance shown in Fig. 46 (dashed line).

6. 100 GeV CoM. Example (b)

The second lattice design, Example (b), is shown in Fig. 47 starting from the IP. The 1.5 m background clearing
dipole is 2.5 m away from the IP and is followed by the triplet quadrupoles with the focusing quadrupole in the
center. The interaction region (IR) stops at about 24 m from the IP. Because of the small low betatron functions
in both transverse planes, the betatron functions at the ﬁnal focusing triplets increase to
1550 m. The natural
chromaticities, of order
40, are high, requiring local correction. Due to the size limitation of the collider ring, it
appears that we have room for only two pairs of interleaved sextupoles on each side of the IP, each pair correcting
chromaticity in one transverse plane. The correction section on each side of the IP spans a distance of roughly 61.3 m.

that their nonlinear eﬀect will be conﬁned in the region between the two sextupoles. Their horizontal phase advances
should also be integral numbers of π from the triplet focusing F-quadrupole so that the chromaticity compensation
for that quadrupole will be most eﬃcient [189]. The SX2’s are the two vertical correction sextupoles which should
be placed similarly at designated locations. In general, it will be diﬃcult to satisfy all the requirements mentioned;
especially in this situation, luminosity arguments limit the lattice size. For this lattice, the Twiss properties at the
centers of the four correction sextupoles are listed in table XII, where all the ﬁgures given by the lattice code are

0.50 for the SX1’s. This trade-oﬀ is explained below.

In fact, they are roughly in the ratios of 1 : (βmax/βmin)1/2 : βmax/βmin : (βmax/βmin)3/2, which amount roughly to
1:10:100:1000 in this lattice. In above, βmax represents either βx at the SX1’s or βy at the SX2’s, and βmin represents
either βy at the SX1’s or βx at the SX2’s. Thus, the ﬁrst two restrictions in Eq. (29) are the most important, implying
that all βmax and βmin for each pair of SX1’s must be made equal and ∆ψx = π between them must be strictly
obeyed. The third restriction is the next important one, for which ¯SSX2 must be made equal for each pair of SX2’s
and their horizontal phase diﬀerence must equal π. The only two parameters left are ∆ψy between a pair of SX1’s and
∆ψy between a pair of SX2’s. They aﬀect the restrictions for the ν
resonances only, where the eﬀective sextupole
strengths ¯SSX1 and ¯SSX2 are involved. Thus if we allow one restriction to be relaxed, the relaxation of ∆ψy = π for
the SX1’s will be least harmful.

Flexible momentum compaction (FMC) modules [192] are used in the arc. The momentum compaction of the arc
has to be made negative in order to cancel the positive momentum compaction of the IR, so that the whole ring
becomes quasi-isochronous. This is accomplished in three ways: 1) removing the central dipole of the usual FMC
module; 2) increasing the length of the ﬁrst and last dipoles, and 3) increasing the negative dispersion at the entrance.
Two such modules will be required for half of the collider ring, one of which is shown in Fig. 48. To close the ring
geometrically, there will be a
72.0 m straight section between the two sets of FMC modules. The total length of the
collider ring is now only C = 354.3 m. This is a nice feature, since a small ring allows a larger number of collisions
before the muons decay appreciably. Note that the IR and local correction sections take up 48.2% of the whole ring.
4. The rf voltage required to maintain a bunch
The momentum compaction factor of this ring is now α0 =
with rms length σℓ and rms momentum spread σδ is Vrf =
ℓ ), where η is the slippage factor and E
the muon energy. On the other hand, if the bucket height is taken as k times the rms momentum spread of the bunch,
the rf harmonic is given by h = C/(kπσℓ). Thus, for σℓ = 4 cm and σδ = 0.0012, this lattice requires an rf voltage of
88k kV. Since α0 is negative already, its absolute value can be further lowered easily if needed. However, we

The dynamical aperture of the lattice is computed by tracking particles with the code COSY INFINITY [193].
Initially 16 particles with the same momentum oﬀset and having vanishing x′ and y′ are placed uniformly on a circle
in the x-y plane. The largest radius that provides survival of the 16 particles in 1000 turns is deﬁned here as the
dynamical aperture at this momentum oﬀset and is plotted in solid in Fig. 49 in units of the rms radius of the beam.
(At the 4 cm low beta IP, the beam has an rms radius of 82 µm.) As a reference, the 7 σ aperture spanning
6 sigmas
of momentum oﬀset is also displayed as a semi-ellipse in dashdot. To maximize the aperture, ﬁrst, the tunes must
be chosen to avoid parametric resonances. The on-momentum amplitude dependent horizontal and vertical tunes are
6 πm, the on-momentum tune variations are at most
given in Eq. (28). With the designed rms ǫx = ǫy = 0.169
×
0.0007. Second, the chromaticity variations with momentum must be as small as possible. This is shown in Fig. 49
(right hand side plot). Note that there are no families of sextupoles to correct for the higher order chromaticities
in this small ring with only four FMC modules. As the momentum spread varies from
1 to 0.9%, νx varies from
8.16698 to 8.07459, and νy from 6.28305 to 6.22369 for the center of the beam.

During aperture tracking we notice that particle loss occurs mostly in the horizontal direction. We are convinced
that the small momentum aperture is a result of the large dispersion swing in the lattice from +4.5 to
3.5 m. For
example, 4.5 m dispersion and 0.6% momentum oﬀset translates into a 2.7 cm oﬀ-axis motion. The nonlinearity of the
lattice will therefore diminish the dynamical aperture. A resonant strength study using, for example, swamp plots and
normalized-resonance-basis-coeﬃcient analysis [196] actually reveals that this lattice and some of its variations are
unusually nonlinear. Recently, we make a modiﬁcation of the FMC arc modules which have a smaller dispersion swing
2.6 to +2.0 m only. The IR has not been changed except for the matching to the arc modules. The aperture

has been tracked with TEAPOT [197] in the same way as COSY and is plotted as dashes in Fig. 49 (left hand side
plot). We see that the momentum aperture has widened appreciably. The dynamical aperture near on-momentum,
however, is one sigma less than the lattice presented here. Nevertheless, it is not clear that this decrease is signiﬁcant
because all tracking has been performed in steps of one sigma only. However this type of aperture is still far from
satisfactory, because so far we have been studying a bare lattice. The aperture will be reduced when fringe ﬁelds,
ﬁeld errors, and misalignment errors are included.

We suspect that the aperture for small momentum spread is limited by the dramatic changes in betatron functions
near the IP [194]. These changes are so large that Hill’s equation would no longer be adequate and the exact equation
for beam transport must be used. This equation brings in nonlinearity and limits the aperture, which can easily be
demonstrated by turning oﬀ all the sextupoles. In other words, although the momentum aperture can be widened by
suitable deployment of sextupoles, the on-momentum dynamical aperture is determined by the triplet quadrupoles
and cannot be increased signiﬁcantly by the sextupoles. Some drastic changes in the low beta design may be necessary.

It has been shown [198] that detector backgrounds originating from beam halo can exceed those from decays in
the vicinity of the interaction point (IP). Only with a dedicated beam cleaning system far enough from the IP can
one mitigate this problem [188]. Muons injected with large momentum errors or betatron oscillations will be lost
within the ﬁrst few turns. After that, with active scraping, the beam halo generated through beam-gas scattering,
resonances and beam-beam interactions at the IP reaches equilibrium and beam losses remain constant throughout
the rest of the cycle.

Two beam cleaning schemes have been designed [188], one for muon colliders at high energies, and one for those at

low energies.

The studies [188] showed that no absorber, ordinary or magnetized, will suﬃce for beam cleaning at 2 TeV; in fact,
the disturbed muons are often lost in the IR, but a simple metal collimator was found to be satisfactory at 100 GeV.

1. Scraping for high energy collider

At high energies, a 3 m long electrostatic deﬂector (Fig. 50) separates muons with amplitudes larger than 3 σ and
deﬂects them into a 3 m long Lambertson magnet, which extracts these downwards through a deﬂection of 17 mrad.
A vertical septum magnet is used in the vertical scraping section instead of the Lambertson to keep the direction of
extracted beam down. The shaving process lasts for the ﬁrst few turns. To achieve practical distances and design
apertures for the separator/Lambertson combinations, β functions must reach a kilometer in the 2 TeV case, but only
100 m at 50 GeV. The complete system consists of a vertical scraping section and two horizontal ones for positive
and negative momentum scraping (the design is symmetric about the center, so scraping is identical for both µ+ and
µ−). The system provides the scraping power of a factor of 1000; that is, for every 1000 halo muons, one remains.

2. Scraping for low energy collider

At 50 GeV, collimating muon halos with a 5 m long steel absorber (Fig. 51) in a simple compact utility section
does an excellent job. Muons lose a signiﬁcant fraction of their energy in such an absorber (8% on average) and have
broad angular and spatial distributions. Almost all of these muons are then lost in the ﬁrst 50-100 m downstream of
the absorber with only 0.07% of the scraped muons reaching the low β quadrupoles in the IR, i.e. a scraping power
is 1500 in this case, which is signiﬁcantly better than with an earlier septum scraping system design [188] similar to
that developed for the high energy collider.

D. Beam-beam tune shift

Several studies have considered beam emittance growth due to the beam-beam tune shift and none have observed
signiﬁcant luminosity loss. For instance, a study [199], using the high energy collider parameters (see table I), in
which particles were tracked assuming Gaussian beam ﬁeld distributions, and no muon decay, showed a luminosity
loss of only 4%. With muon decay included, the loss contribution from beam-beam eﬀects is even less. Another study
[200] using a particle in cell approach with no assumptions about ﬁeld symmetry obtained a similar result. Collisions
between beams displaced by 10% of their radius also gave little loss. But all these studies assumed an ideal lattice,
and none considered whether small losses due to nonlinearities give rise to an unacceptable background.

E. Impedance/wakeﬁeld considerations

A study [201] has examined the resistive wall impedance longitudinal instabilities in rings at several energies. At
the higher energies and larger momentum spreads, solutions were found with small but ﬁnite momentum compaction
and moderate rf voltages. For the special case of the Higgs Factory, with its very low momentum spread, a solution
was found with no synchrotron motion, but rf was provided to correct the ﬁrst order impedance generated momentum
spread. The remaining oﬀ-momentum tails which might generate background could be removed by a higher harmonic
rf correction without aﬀecting luminosity. Solutions to the higher energy and larger momentum spread cases without
synchrotron motion are also being considered.

Given the very slow or nonexistent synchrotron oscillations, the transverse beam breakup instability is signiﬁcant.
This instability can be stabilized using rf quadrupole [181] induced BNS damping. For instance, the required tune
4
10−
shift with position in the bunch, calculated using the two particle model approximation [202], is only 1.58
for the 3 TeV case using a 1 cm radius aluminum pipe. This stabilizes the resistive wall instability. However, this
application of BNS damping to a quasi-isochronous ring, and other head-tail instabilities due to the chromaticities ξ
and η1, needs more study.

F. Bending magnet design

The dipole ﬁeld assumed in the 100 GeV collider lattices described above was 8 T. This ﬁeld can be obtained using
1.8o niobium titanium (NbTi) cos theta superconducting magnets similar to those developed for the LHC. The only
complication is the n eed for a tungsten shield between the beam and coils to shield the latter from beam decay
heating.

The µ’s decay within the rings (µ−

e−νeνµ), producing electrons whose mean energy is approximately 0.35 that
of the muons. With no shielding, the average power deposited per unit length would be about 2 kW/m in the 4 TeV
machine, and 300 W/m in the 100 GeV Higgs factory. Figure 52 shows the power penetrating tungsten shields of
diﬀerent thickness [44,187,188,203]. One sees that 3 cm in the low energy case, or 6 cm at high energy would reduce
the power to below 10 W/m, which can reasonably be taken by superconducting magnets.
Figure 53 shows the cross section of a baseline magnet suitable for the 100 GeV collider.
The quadrupoles could use warm iron poles placed as close to the beam as practical. The coils could then be either

→

superconducting or warm, placed at a greater distance from the beam and shielded from it by the poles.

FIG. 53. Cross Section of a baseline dipole magnet suitable for the 100 GeV collider.

The collider ring could be made smaller, and the luminosity increased, if higher ﬁeld dipoles were used. In the
low energy case, the gain would not be great since less than half the circumference is devoted to the arcs. For this
reason, and to avoid yet another technical challenge, higher ﬁeld magnets are not part of the baseline design of a 100
GeV collider. But they would give a signiﬁcant luminosity improvement for the higher energy colliders, and would be
desirable there. There have been several studies of possible designs, three of which (two that are promising and one
that appears not to work) are included below.

66

1. Alternative racetrack Nb3Sn dipole

A higher ﬁeld magnet based on Nb3Sn conductor and racetrack coils is presently being designed. The Nb3Sn
conductor allows higher ﬁelds and provides a large temperature margin over the operating temperature, but being
brittle and sensitive to bending or other stress, presents a number of engineering challenges.

In this design, the stress levels in the conductor are reduced by the use of a rectangular coil block geometry and
end support problems are reduced by keeping the coils ﬂat. In the more conventional cos theta designs, the conductor
is distributed around a cylinder and the forces add up towards the midplane; in addition, the ends, as they arc over
the cylinder, are relatively hard to support.

The geometry of the cross section is shown in Fig. 54. It uses all 2-D ﬂat racetrack coils. Each quadrant of the
magnet aperture has two blocks of conductors. The block at the pole in the ﬁrst quadrant has a return block in the
second quadrant, similar to that in a conventional design. The height of this block is such that it completely clears
the bore. In a conventional design, the second block, the midplane block, would also have a return block in the second
quadrant. That would, however, require the conductor block to be lifted up in the ends to clear the bore and thus
would lose the simple 2-D geometry. In the proposed design, the return block retains the 2-D coil geometry, as it is
returned on the same side (see Fig. 54) and naturally clears the bore. Since the return block does not contribute to
the ﬁeld, this design uses 50% more conductor. This, however, is a small penalty to pay for a few magnets where the
performance and not the cost is a major issue. The ﬁeld lines are also shown in Fig. 54.

Preliminary design parameters for two cases are given in table XIII. The ﬁrst case is one where the performance of
the cable used is the same that is in the LBL D20 magnet, which created a central ﬁeld of 13.5 T. The second case is
the one where the cable is graded and two types of cable are used, and it is assumed that a reported improvement in
cable performance is realized. It is expected to produce a central ﬁeld of 14.7 T when operated at 4.2 oK.

2. Alternative Cos Theta Nb3Sn dipole

In this case the problem with the brittle and sensitive conductor is solved by winding the coil inside many separate
slots cut in metal support cylinders. There is no build up of forces on the coil at the mid-plane. The slots continue
around the ends, and thus solve the support problem there too.

Figure 55 shows this alternative Nb3Sn dipole cos theta design. It is an extension of the concept used to build
helical magnets [204] for the polarized proton program at RHIC [205]. The magnet is wound with pre-reacted,
kapton-insulated, B-stage impregnated, low current cable. The build up of forces is controlled by laying the cables
in machined slots in a metal support cylinder. After winding, the openings of the slots are bridged by metal spacers
and the coils pre-compressed inward by winding B-stage impregnated high tensile thread around the spacers. After
curing, the outside of each coil assembly is machined prior to its insertion into an outer coil, or into the yoke. There
are 3 layers. The inner bore is 55 mm radius, the outer coil radius approximately 118 mm, and the yoke inside radius
is 127 mm. The maximum copper current density is 1300 A/mm2.

FIG. 55. Cross section of alternative high ﬁeld slot dipole made with Nb3Sn conductor.

Using the same material speciﬁcations as used in the above high ﬁeld option, a central short sample ﬁeld of 13.2
T was calculated. This is somewhat less than the block design discussed above, but could be improved by increasing
the cable diameters to improve the currently rather poor (64%) cable to cable-plus-insulator ratio.

3. Study of C-magnet dipole

FIG. 56. Cross section of an unsuccessful alternative high ﬁeld C magnet with open mid-plane.

Figure 56 shows the cross section of a high ﬁeld dipole magnet in which it was hoped to bring the coils closer to
the beam pipe without suﬀering excessive heating from beam decay. The coil design [206] appeared reasonable, but
the required avoidance of coil heating was not achieved.
Decay electrons are generated at very small angles (

1/γ) to the beam, and with an average energy about 1/3
of the beam. Such electrons initially spiral inward (to the right in Fig. 56) bent by the high dipole ﬁeld. In the high
energy case, these electrons also radiate a signiﬁcant fraction of their energy as (
1 GeV) synchrotron gamma rays,
some of which end up on the outside (to the left in Fig. 56). The concept was to use a very wide beam pipe, allow
the electrons to exit between the coils, and be absorbed in an external cooled dump. Unfortunately a preliminary
study found that a substantial fraction of the electrons did not reach the dump. They were bent back outward before
reaching it by the return ﬁeld of the magnet coils and the nature of the curved ring geometry. Such electrons were
then trapped about the null in the vertical ﬁeld and eventually hit the upper or lower face of the unshielded vacuum
pipe. They showered, and deposited unacceptable levels of heat in the coils.

≈

≈

Another idea called for collimators between each bending magnet that would catch such trapped electrons. This
option has not been studied in detail, but the impedance consequences of such periodic collimators are expected to
be unacceptable.

Further study of such options might ﬁnd a solution, but the use of a thick cylindrical heavy metal shield appears

practical, adequate, and is thus the current baseline choice.

G. Energy scale calibration

In order to scan the width of a Higgs boson of mass around 100 GeV, one needs to measure the energy of the
individual muon stores to an accuracy of a few parts per million, since the width of a Higgs boson of that mass is
expected to be a few MeV. Assuming that muon bunches can be produced with modest polarizations of
0.25, and
that the polarization can be maintained from turn to turn in the collider, it is possible to use the precession of the
polarization in the ring to measure accurately the average energy of the muons [12]. The total energy of electrons
produced by muon decay observed in the calorimeter placed in the ring varies from turn to turn due to the g
2
precession of the muon spin, which is proportional to the Lorentz factor γ of the muon beam. Figure 57 shows the
result of a ﬁt of the total electron energy observed in a calorimeter to a functional form that includes muon decay
and spin precession. Figure 58 shows the fractional error δγ/γ obtained from a series of such ﬁts plotted against the
fractional error of measurement in the total electron energy that depends on the electron statistics. It has been shown
that precisions of a few parts per million in γ are possible with modest electron statistics of
100, 000 detected. It
should be noted that there are 3.2

≈
106 decays per meter for a muon intensity of 1012 muons.

−

≈

Our current plans to measure the energy due to decay electrons entail an electromagnetic calorimeter that is
segmented both longitudinally and transversely and placed inside an enlarged beam pipe in one of the straight
sections in the collider ring. The length of the straight section upstream of the calorimeter can be chosen to control
the total number of decays and hence the rate of energy deposition. The sensitive material can be gaseous, since the

energy resolution is controlled by decay ﬂuctuations rather than sampling error. In order to measure the total number
of electrons entering the calorimeter, we plan to include a calorimeter layer with little absorber upstream of it as the
ﬁrst layer.

This scheme will enable us to calibrate and correct the energy of individual bunches of muons and permit us to

measure the width of a low mass Higgs boson.

VIII. RADIATION AND BACKGROUNDS

A. Conventional radiation

The proton source generates a 4 MW proton beam, which is comparable to the proposed spallation source [92].
This is a very high power and will, as in the spallation source, require great care in reducing unwanted particle losses,
as well as careful machine shielding, and target and beam dump design. Initial studies of the target and capture
solenoid region have been performed with the MARS code, and preliminary speciﬁcations for shielding determined,
but more work is needed.

The cooling and accelerator chain is rather clean, since a relatively small fraction of the muons decay, and their

energies are low. Power deposited in the accelerators is typically 10-30 W/m (see table IX and table X).

If no muons are lost, then the only sources of radiation are the muon decays yielding electrons and neutrinos. The
neutrino radiation we discuss below. The electrons shower in the collider beam pipe shields, depositing most of their

energy there and a relatively small amount in the magnet coils and yoke. Radioactivation levels, as calculated by
MARS [207], after ﬁve years of 4 TeV collider operation are given in table XIV for the cases immediately after turn
oﬀ and 1 day after turn oﬀ. It is seen that the areas in the tunnel that are outside the magnets are relatively free
of radioactivation. Special procedures will be needed when the shield pipe has to be opened, as for instance when a
magnet is changed. For the lower energy colliders, the radioactivation levels are proportionally less.

If muons are lost either accidentally, by scraping, or deliberately after some number of turns, then the muons
penetrate to considerable distances in the soil/rock (3.5 km at 2 TeV, 800 m at 250 GeV) and deposit their energy
directly or through their interaction products. Figure 59 and Fig. 60 show the distribution of radiation levels, assuming

B. Neutrino induced radiation

It has been shown [64,208–211] that the neutrinos created in muon beam decays can generate excessive secondary
radiation at large distances from a muon collider (see Fig. 61). The surface radiation dose DB(Sv) in units of
equivalent [212] doses (Sv) over a time t(s), in the plane of a bending magnet of ﬁeld B(T), in a circular collider with
beam energy E(T eV ), average bending ﬁeld < B(T ) >, at a depth d(m) (assuming a spherical earth), with muon
current (of each sign) of Iµ(muons/s/sign) is given by:

and the dose DS at a location on the surface, in line with a high beta straight section of length ℓ(m), is:

The equation for DS assumes that the average divergence angles satisfy the condition: σθ << 1
γ . This condition is
not satisﬁed in the straight sections approaching the IP, and these regions, despite their length, do not contribute a
signiﬁcant dose.

which may be taken to be within a reasonable limit. The general trend of these expressions has been veriﬁed by Monte
Carlo simulations [213] using MARS. In particular, for the 3 TeV case the needed depth to stay within 1% DFed, is
300 m instead of 500 m.

Special care will be required in the lattice design to assure that no ﬁeld- free region longer than 0.6 m is present.
This may sound diﬃcult, but it may be noted that the presence of a ﬁeld of even 1 T, is enough to reduce the dose to
a level below the Federal limit. The application of such a ﬁeld over all rf and other components seems possible [213].
For lower energy machines, the requirements rapidly get easier: a 0.5 TeV machine at 100 m depth could have 25 m

long sections, for the same surface dose. For a 100 GeV machine the doses are negligible.

For machines above 3 TeV, various strategies can be employed:

The machines could be built at greater depths (mines many km deep are common).

The vertical beam orbits in the machine could be varied so as to spread the plane of radiation and thus reduce
the peak doses.

The speciﬁc locations in line with straight sections could be purchased and restricted.

Straight sections could be shortened further by using continuous combined function magnets.

The machines could be built on an island, but this could have diﬃculties associated with access to power and
other utilities.

But for any large increase in energy, to 10 TeV for instance, some reduction in muon beam ﬂux probably will be

required. The resultant loss of luminosity might be made up in a number of ways [4]:

The beam-beam tune shift constraint could be avoided by introducing a conducting medium (e.g. liquid lithium)
at the interaction point [214].

The focusing strength could be increased by the use of plasma or other exotic focusing method.

Better cooling could be developed. Optical stochastic cooling [137], for instance, might reduce the emittances
by many orders of magnitude, thus greatly reducing the required beam currents. Indeed, such cooling would
require lower currents to function appropriately.

Such options will need future study.

C. Muon decay background

×

With 4

1012 muons per bunch in a 2 + 2 TeV collider ring there are approximately 4

105 muon decays per meter
giving rise to high energy electrons. These oﬀ-energy, oﬀ-axis electrons undergo bremsstrahlung when they traverse
magnetic ﬁelds. When they exit the beam pipe they interact and produce electromagnetic showers and, to a lesser
extent, hadrons and muons. Much of this debris can be locally shielded, so the primary concern is muon decays near
the interaction point [44]. This is the background we discuss in some detail below.

×

Detailed Monte Carlo simulations of electromagnetic, hadronic and muon components of the background
[44,187,198,203,213,215,216] have been performed using the MARS [115] and GEANT [148] codes. The most re-
cent study [215] has been done with GEANT. Figure 62 shows the ﬁnal 130 meters of the 2 + 2 TeV detector region
in this study. It includes the ﬁnal four quadrupoles, dipoles and a solenoidal ﬁeld surrounding the detector. This
study:

followed shower neutrons and photons down to 40 keV and electrons to 25 keV.

used a tungsten shield over the beam, extending outward to an angle of 20 degrees from the axis.

Inside this shield, the clear radius has a minimum, in the high energy cases, at a distance from the IP of 1.1 m
(80 cm for 50+50 GeV). At this point, and in an expanding cone beyond it, the clear radius is maintained at
approximately 4 sigma of the beam size.

Between this minimum aperture point and the IP, the clear radius follows an inverse cone, increasing as it
approaches the IP, with an angle a little greater than the 4 sigma of the beam divergence. These cones are
designed so that the detector could not ‘see’ any surface directly illuminated by the initial decay electrons,
whether in the forward or backward (albedo) direction (see ﬁgure 63).

The resulting open space between the IP and the tip of the cone is approximately 3 cm in the 4 TeV and
500 GeV CoM cases, and approximately 6 cm in the 100 GeV CoM case.

The inner surface of each shield is shaped into a series of collimating steps and slopes to maximize the absorption
of electron showers from electrons at very small angles to the cone surface, thus reducing the funnelling of low
energy electrons down the pipes.

•

Further upstream, prior to the ﬁrst quadrupole (from 2.5 to 4 m in the Higgs case), an 8 T dipole, with
collimators inside, is used to sweep decay electrons before the ﬁnal collimation.

the parameters and shielding design will be required for this case.

Every modern detector will have to be able to identify and reconstruct secondary vertices such as those associated
with b-quark decays. In order to estimate the viability of a vertex detector we have to show that the occupancy of
its elements is not higher than about 1%. Figure 64 shows the occupancy as a function of radial distance from the
interaction point for the three CoM energies studied : 0.1, 0.5 and 4 TeV. The occupancy was calculated for silicon
pads of 300 µm
300 µm, and assuming interaction probabilities of 0.003 and 0.0003 for low energy photons and
neutrons respectively. One can observe that the total occupancy (left ﬁgure) is above one percent for small radii. Most
of the hits is due to conversions of photons. The occupancy due to hits resulting from charged particles is below 1%
(right hand ﬁgure). One can lower the occupancy at small radii by using smaller pixel sizes, as indicated in table XV
below, as well as by using innovative detector ideas as described in the next section.

×

Table XV gives the hit density for the Higgs factory from the various sources and the occupancy of pixels of the
given sizes; in each case the number is given per bunch crossing. The hit density for the higher energy machines is
found to be somewhat lower due to the smaller decay angles of the electrons.

they can be locally shielded. However, muons can traverse long distances and therefore have the potential to generate
background in a detector. The magnitude of this background depends on a detailed knowledge of the injected beam
proﬁle and a credible model for beam halo and beam losses. More work is needed before these are well enough
understood. Nevertheless, it is clear that the beam will need careful preparation before injection into the collider,
and the injection system will have to be precise and free of ripple.

The collimation system described in the previous subsection was designed to scrape the beam both initially and
during the 1000 turns, to assure that all loss occurs at the scraper and not near the IP. That study indicated
suppressions better than 103 of background in the detector [188].

Beam loss must be limited as far as possible. Gas scattering has been studied [217] and shown to give a negligible
contribution. The eﬀects of beam-beam scattering are under study and need further work. Momentum spread tails
from uncorrected wakeﬁeld eﬀects must be controlled. Assuming that the total loss from all causes, after injection

E. Pair production

Coherent beam-beam electron pair production (beamstrahlung) has been shown [200,218] to be negligible, but the

→

incoherent pair production (i.e. µ+µ−

e+e−) in the 4 TeV collider case is signiﬁcant.

The cross section is estimated to be 10 mb [218], which would give rise to a background of

104 electron pairs
per bunch crossing. The electrons at production do not have signiﬁcant transverse momentum but the ﬁelds of the
on-coming 3µm bunch can deﬂect them towards the detector. A simple program was written to track electrons from
close to the axis (the worst case) as they are deﬂected away from the bunch center. Once clear of the opposing bunch
the tracks spiral under the inﬂuence of the experimental solenoid ﬁeld. Figures 65 shows the radii vs. length of these
electron tracks for initial momenta from 3.8 to 3000 MeV in geometric steps of √2. Fig. 65(a) is for a solenoidal ﬁeld
of 2 T and Fig. 65(b) for 4 T. In the 2 T case tracks with initial energy below 30 MeV do not make it out to a detector
at 10 cm, while those above 100 MeV have too small an initial angle and remain within the shield. Approximately
10% (3000 tracks) of these are in this energy range and pass through a detector at 10 cm. The track ﬂuences at the
ends of the detector are less than 10 tracks per cm2 which should not present a serious problem. At 5 cm, there are
4500 tracks giving a ﬂuence of 30 per cm2, which is also probably acceptable. If the detector solenoid ﬁeld is raised
to 4 T, then no electrons reach 10 cm and the ﬂux at 5 cm is reduced by a factor of 2.

The GEANT/MARS studies [44,203,207] also found a signiﬁcant ﬂux of muons with quite high energies, from µ
pair production in electromagnetic showers (Bethe-Heitler). Figures 66 and 67 show the trajectories of typical muons
from their sources in the shielding around the beam pipe to the detector. Figure 66 is for a 4 TeV CoM collider,
where the muons have high energy and long path lengths. A relatively long (130 m) section of beam pipe prior to
the detector is shown. Figure 67 is for the 100 GeV CoM collider for which, since the muons have rather short path
lengths, only a limited length of beam pipe is shown. Note that the scales are extremely distorted: the 20o shielding
cones on the right hand of the ﬁgures appear at steeper angles.

The most serious eﬀect appears to arise when these muons make deeply inelastic interactions and deposit spikes of
energy in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. This is not serious in the Higgs case, for which the ﬂuxes and
cross sections are low, but at the higher collider energies they generate signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations in global parameters,
such as transverse energy and missing transverse energy.

Table XVII gives some parameters of the muons for three diﬀerent machine energies. In the 4 TeV and 500 GeV

CoM cases, massive lead shielding outside the focus quadrupoles has been included.

Figures 68 and 69 show energy deposition from Bethe-Heitler muons in a typical bunch crossing. These depositions
are plotted against the cosine of the polar angle and azimuthal angle in the calorimeter for 4 TeV and for 500 GeV
CoM, respectively. The massive lead shielding referred to above was not included in this study. Right hand plots in
Figs. 68 and 69 show the same distributions with a 1 ns timing cut. It is seen that the timing cut, if it is possible,

is eﬀective in removing energy spikes at small rapidity, but has little eﬀect in the forward and backward directions.
The overall reduction in energy deposition is about a factor of two.

The energy spikes can cause at least three problems: 1) they aﬀect the triggers and event selections based on overall
or transverse energy balance; 2) they can generate false jets and 3) they can give errors in the energies of real jets.
After a pedestal subtraction, the eﬀects on energy balances do not seem serious. The generation of false jets can be
eliminated by a longitudinal energy distribution cut without introducing signiﬁcant ineﬃciency. Energy errors in real
jets appear to be the most serious problem. They can be reduced by the application of radial energy distribution
cuts, but such cuts introduce signiﬁcant ineﬃciencies for lower energy jets. More study is needed.

Earlier studies [216] with MARS, using less sophisticated shielding, gave results qualitatively in agreement with

those from GEANT.

IX. DETECTOR SCENARIOS

The background consists of neutral and charged particles. For neutrons, the longitudinal and radial ﬂuences were
found to be comparable. The photons (average energy about 1 MeV) show a clear radial source. The charged particles
and the photons do not all point back to the interaction point, but to the general vicinity of the IP, namely to the
region where the 20 degree tungsten shield becomes thinner. The ﬂux of secondary muons (Bethe-Heitler pairs) is
mainly longitudinal.

We would expect this background to pepper the tracking volume with random hits and produce signiﬁcant energy
pedestals in the calorimeter cells. These eﬀects are considered in more detail in the following sections. In general,
in designing a strawman detector that must operate in a large background ﬂux we will want to employ as many
detector channels as is practical. A strawman muon collider detector design with a few times 106 non-pixel channels
would seem reasonable [219]. Over the last few years, development of pixel detectors has resulted in a quantum jump
106 pixels, and
in the number of electronic channels. For example, the SLD vertex detector [220] contains 300
similar numbers of pixels are planned for the LHC vertex detectors. Hence, a strawman muon collider vertex detector
employing 108

109 pixels would seem reasonable.

A. Silicon vertex detector schemes

From table XVI, it can be seen that the radiation damage to silicon detectors is acceptable in terms of the number
of hits per year and the resultant lifetime of the detector. This prompts [219] us to consider the following options for
silicon vertex detector design for the muon collider:

•

•

•

Silicon drift detector. The idea, which is described in the muon collider feasibility study [44,33], is to exploit
the time gap between bunch crossings by using the silicon drift detector technology [221] (see Fig. 70). Using
300 µm2 detectors it should be possible to obtain a resolution of a few microns in the drift direction. This
50
would facilitate a very precise vertex detector, although questions of radiation hardness remain to be resolved
for this option.

×

Columnar pixels [222]. The idea is to exploit the very well localized primary vertex position by using long thin
tracking pixels that point at the IP and therefore record large ionization signals only for tracks coming from the
50 µm2 pixels that are 300 µm deep. The pixels are produced
IP (Fig. 71). For example, one can construct 50
using controlled feed-through-drilling technology to create a lattice of anodes and cathodes that extend through
the 300 µm thick wafer.

×

Pixel micro-telescopes [223]. The idea is to replace a single pixel layer with two layers separated by a small
distance, and read them out by taking the AND between appropriate pairs. The distance between the layers
is optimized so that soft MeV tracks (which are associated with almost 80% of the predicted background hits)
produced in one layer curl up in the magnetic ﬁeld before reaching the second layer. Thus, the pixel micro-
telescope is blind to the soft background hits and also blind to tracks that do not come from the IP. In the
example shown in Fig. 72 the top measurement layer has a ﬁner granularity than the bottom conﬁrmation layer.
The corresponding rows in the two pixel layers can be read out with diﬀerent clock speeds to maintain the
correct correspondence at the input into the AND gate that registers valid hits in the telescope. If the readout
rows are the ones parallel to the beam direction, then variable clock speeds can be used to maintain the correct
accepted direction with respect to the IP.

angle in the calorimeter for a 4 TeV CoM collider. Right hand plot shows the same distributions with a 1 ns timing cut.

The challenge of a high background environment is clearly fruitful ground for new ideas. The above considerations
suggest that, provided silicon detectors can be used in the inner tracking volume, it should be possible to construct a
vertex detector able to tag secondary vertices from short lived particles at a muon collider. Detailed simulations are
currently underway to establish this more concretely.

B. Outer tracking schemes

The predicted background ﬂuxes for a Higgs factory detector at a radius of 50 cm are 200 photons/cm2,
350 neutrons/cm2, and 0.08 charged tracks per cm2. The neutron ﬂux is therefore about the same as the ﬂux in
the inner tracking volume, whereas the photon and charged particle ﬂuxes are signiﬁcantly less than those predicted
at smaller radii. There are two alternative tracking strategies under consideration:

•

×

Low ﬁeld, large tracking volume drift chamber option. This option, which is described in the muon collider book
[224], uses a TPC to exploit the 20 µs time between bunch crossings. This option is viable for the very high
1.5 TeV). The large neutron ﬂux necessitates choosing a gas that does not contain
energy muon collider (1.5
hydrogen. A mixture of 90% neon plus 10% CF4 gives a drift velocity of 9.4 cm/µs, which is close to that required
to match the bunch crossing time. High-pT tracks from the IP embedded in the predicted background ﬂux have
been simulated for the TPC shown in Fig. 73. The simulation includes ionization, drift and diﬀusion of the
electrons in the gas, multiplication, and other details of the detection process. The majority of the background
hits arises from low energy Compton recoils yielding very low energy electrons that have a radius of curvature
of less than 1 mm in the 2 T ﬁeld. Their projection on the readout plane covers not more than one readout
0.4 cm2). These background electrons, together with the nuclear recoils from neutron scatters, yield
pitch (0.3
large pulses that can be removed by cutting on the maximum acceptable pulse height. The simulation predicts
that with an average background ﬂux of 100 photons/cm2, reasonable pulse height cuts remove only 1% of the
eﬀective TPC volume, and yield tracks of high quality. However, it was realized that positive ion build-up may

be a problem with the design shown in Fig. 73. If this problem can be overcome, the design shown in the ﬁgure
yields a simulated momentum resolution of about 1.2% for tracks with pT = 50 GeV/c.

•

High ﬁeld, compact silicon tracker option. An alternative strategy is to make a compact tracker by using
silicon in a high ﬁeld (for example, 4 T). As an example, consider the geometry shown in Fig. 74 in which a
4-layer pixel vertex detector is embedded in a 4-layer small angle stereo cylindrical silicon microstrip detector
300 µm2 resolution. We take the inner layer of the vertex detector to consist of a cylinder of

Using a parametric calculation of the momentum resolution, including multiple scattering, we obtain σp/p2 =

Both the low ﬁeld and high ﬁeld tracking solutions look interesting and should be pursued with more complete
simulations.

C. Electromagnetic calorimeter schemes

Background particles entering the electromagnetic calorimeter are expected to give rise to signiﬁcant energy
pedestals in the calorimeter cells. Consider a 4 m long calorimeter that is 25 radiation lengths deep, has an in-
2 cm2 cells. This gives a total of 105 electromagnetic calorimeter
ner radius of 120 cm, and is constructed from 2
towers. The GEANT background calculation predicts that each cell sees on average nγ = 4 background photons per
2 MeV. If an electromagnetic shower occupies 9 cells, then the mean background
crossing with a mean energy Eγ = 1
pedestal will be about 70 MeV. This pedestal can be subtracted from the measured energies. The precision of the
resulting electron and photon energy measurements will depend on the ﬂuctuations in the mean background energy

per cell. For an electromagnetic shower occupying 9 cells, the ﬂuctuations in the pedestals are predicted to be about
10 MeV. This takes into account the ﬂuctuations in the number and the energies of the background photons.

D. Hadronic calorimeter schemes

None of the energy generated by background photons in the electromagnetic calorimeter is expected to penetrate
into the hadronic calorimeter. GEANT calculations show that the total kinetic energy deposited by neutrons in the
calorimeter is of the order of 140 TeV with an average energy of 30 MeV per neutron. In order to estimate what
fraction of the kinetic energy of the neutrons will be visible, we should consider the materials involved. For this
simulation we have presumed an equal mix by volume of liquid argon (as active medium) and copper (as absorber).
At 30 MeV we expect only a small fraction of the neutrons to knock oﬀ protons and only about 10% of the proton
ionization to be visible in the liquid. Presuming a hadronic calorimeter with 104 towers, with the material composition
described above, the average energy read in the liquid argon will be of the order of 10 MeV per tower with a ﬂuctuation
1012 muons per bunch, the photons and neutrons are expected
of 5 MeV. In summary, a 50
to generate pedestals of 800 and 100 GeV respectively. The estimates for pedestal ﬂuctuations are at or below the
level of the expected electronic noise. Therefore we believe that the subtraction of these pedestals would present little
problem both for the electromagnetic and the hadronic calorimeters. The presence of the high neutron background
should be taken into account in choosing materials for calorimetry. Liquid argon seems a natural choice for the
electromagnetic calorimeter.

The energy deposited by the Bethe-Heitler muons in the calorimeter is given in table XVII as a function of the
center of mass energy of the collider. For low center of mass energies, such as the Higgs factory, the Bethe-Heitler
muons are not a problem, since there are fewer of them and they leave less energy by catastrophic bremsstrahlung in
the calorimeter. For the higher energy option (4 TeV in the CoM or higher), one should explore ways to correct for the
energy deposition in the calorimeter, such as pattern recognition of the muon tracks or by using timing information.

E. Muon detector schemes

The predicted background ﬂux is expected to be relatively modest beyond a radius of 3 m in the vicinity of the
muon detector. Several possible technologies for muon detectors at a muon collider were discussed during Snowmass

Cathode strip chambers. The idea, which is described in the muon collider book [224], is to use MWPCs with
segmented cathodes and a short (35 ns) drift time to provide prompt signals for triggering. The precision of the
coordinate measurements would be expected to be of order 50 µm

a few mm.

Threshold Cherenkov counter. The idea is to use a gas Cherenkov radiator to exploit the directionality of
Cherenkov radiation in order to select high-pT muons coming from the IP. The device would also give excellent
timing resolution (of order 2 ns).

Long drift jet chamber with pad readout [225] (Fig. 75). Drift time provides the z coordinate, and pad readout
provides the r-φ coordinates. Directionality at the trigger level is provided by the pattern of pad hits within a
limited time window. The drift ﬁeld is provided by cathode strips on grooved G-10 plates. Using 90% argon
plus 10% CF4 and a maximum drift distance of 50 cm, the maximum drift time is 5 µs.

At high energy in the CoM, the channel µ+µ−

µ+µ− + Higgs boson becomes particularly attractive to study
using the muon collider, if the forward going muons from the interaction can be detected [226]. The method provides
a capability to search for any missing neutral state such as the Higgs boson via the missing mass technique. We are
investigating methods to improve our forward muon detection capability.

Unlike protons, muons are point-like but, unlike electrons, they emit relatively little synchrotron radiation and

therefore can be accelerated and collided in rings.

X. CONCLUSIONS

→

h, 43000 times larger than for e+e−

Another advantage resulting from the low synchrotron radiation is the lack of beamstrahlung and the possibility of
very small collision energy spreads. A beam energy spread of ∆E/E of 0.003% is considered feasible for a 100 GeV
machine. It has been shown that by observing spin precession, the absolute energy could be determined to a small
fraction of this width. These features become important in conjunction with the large s-channel Higgs production
(µ+µ−
h), allowing precision measurements of the Higgs mass, width and
branching ratios. A higher energy muon collider can also distinguish the nearly degenerate heavy Higgs bosons H 0
and A0 of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model, since these states can also be produced in the
s channel. We have also examined the ability of the muon collider to study techni-resonances, do a high luminosity
study of Z boson physics, scan the W and t¯t thresholds to make precision mass measurements as well as SUSY and
strongly interacting W boson physics. The high luminosity proton driver and the cold low energy muons permit the
study of rare kaon and muon decays. Muon storage rings will permit low-systematics studies of neutrino oscillations
for a wide range of mixing angle and δm2 phase space with hitherto unattainable sensitivity.

→

Such machines are clearly desirable. The issues are:

whether they can be built and physics done with them

•

•

what they will cost.

Much progress has been made in addressing the ﬁrst question and the answer, so far, appears to be yes. It is too
early to address the second.

We have studied machines with CoM energies of 0.1, 0.4 and 3 TeV, deﬁned parameters and simulated many of
their components. Most recent work has been done on the 0.1 TeV First Muon Collider, the energy taken to be
representative of the actual mass of a Higgs particle. A summary of progress and challenges follows:

a. Proton driver The speciﬁcation of the proton driver for the three machines is assumed the same: 1014 pro-
tons/pulse at an energy above 16 GeV and 1-2 ns rms bunch lengths. There have been three studies of how to achieve
these parameters. The most conservative, at 30 GeV, is a generic design. Upgrades of the FNAL (at 16 GeV) and
BNL (at 24 GeV) accelerators have also been studied. Despite the very short bunch requirement, each study has
concluded that the speciﬁcation is attainable. Experiments are planned to conﬁrm some aspects of these designs.

b. Pion production and capture Pion production has been taken from the best models available, but an experiment
(BNL-E910) that has taken data, and is being analyzed, will reﬁne these models. The assumed 20 T capture solenoid
will require state-of-the-art technology. Capture, decay and phase rotation have been simulated, and have achieved
the speciﬁed production of 0.3 muons per initial proton. The most serious remaining issues for this part of the machine
are:

1. The nature and material of the target: The baseline assumption is that a liquid metal jet will be used, but the
eﬀects of shock heating by the beam, and of the eddy currents induced in the liquid as it enters the solenoid,
are not yet fully understood.

2. The maximum rf ﬁeld in the phase rotation: For the short pulses used, the current assumptions would be
reasonably conservative under normal operating conditions, but the eﬀects of the massive radiation from the
nearby target are not known.

Both these questions can be answered in a target experiment planned to start within the next two years at the BNL
AGS.

Polarization of the muon beams represents a signiﬁcant physics advantage and is an important feature of a muon
collider. Polarized muon beams are possible. Muons are produced with 100% polarization in the rest frame of the
pion, but they travel in all directions. By accepting the forward going muons, it is easy to obtain 25% polarization in
either beam easily. The amount of polarization can be increased with an accompanying price in luminosity.

c. Cooling The required ionization cooling is the most diﬃcult and least understood element in any of the muon
colliders studied. Ionization cooling is a phenomenon that occurs whenever there is energy loss in a strong focusing
environment.

But achieving the nearly 106 reduction required is a challenge. Cooling over a wide range has been simulated using
lithium lenses and ideal (linear matrix) matching and acceleration. Examples of limited sections of solenoid lattices
with realistic accelerating ﬁelds have now been simulated, but the speciﬁcation and simulation of a complete system
has not yet been done. Much theoretical work remains: space charge and wakeﬁelds must be included; lattices at the
start and end of the cooling sequences must be designed; lattices including liquid lithium lenses must be studied, and
the sections must be matched together and simulated as a full sequence. The tools for this work are nearly ready, and
this project should be completed within two years.

Technically, one of the most challenging aspects of the cooling system appears to be:

86

•

High gradient rf (e.g. 36 MV/m at 805 MHz) operating in strong (5-10 T) magnetic ﬁeld, with beryllium foils
between the cavities.

An experiment is planned that will test such a cavity, in the required ﬁelds, in about two years time. On an
approximately six year time scale, a Cooling Test Facility is being proposed that could test ten meter lengths of
diﬀerent cooling systems. If they are required, then an urgent need is to develop:

•

Lithium Lenses: (e.g. 2 cm diameter, 70 cm long, liquid lithium lenses with 10 T surface ﬁelds and a repetition
rate of 15 Hz).

The use of 31 T solenoids could avoid their need, at least in the low energy First Muon Collider, which would ease the
urgency of this rather long term R&D, but both options would require long-term R&D. Meanwhile a short lithium
lens is under construction at BINP (Novosibirsk, Russia).

d. Acceleration The acceleration system is probably the least controversial, although possibly the most expensive,
part of a muon collider. Preliminary parameters have been speciﬁed for acceleration sequences for a 100 GeV and
a 3 TeV machine, but they need reﬁnement.
In the low energy case, a linac is followed by three recirculating or
FFAG accelerators. In the high energy accelerator, the recirculating or FFAG accelerators are followed by three fast
ramping synchrotrons employing alternating pulsed and superconducting magnets. The parameters do not appear to
be extreme, and it does not appear as if serious problems are likely.

e. Collider The collider lattices are challenging because of the requirement of very low beta functions at the
interaction point, high single bunch intensities, and short bunch lengths. However, the fact that all muons will decay
after about 800 turns means that slowly developing instabilities are not a problem. Feasibility lattices have been
generated for a 4 TeV case, and more detailed designs for 100 GeV machines are been studied. In the latter case, but
still without errors, 5σ acceptances in both transverse and longitudinal phase space have been achieved in tracking
studies. Beam scraping schemes have been designed for both the low energy (collimators) and high energy (septum
extractors) cases.

The short bunch length and longitudinal stability problems are avoided if the rings, as speciﬁed, are suﬃciently
isochronous, but some rf is needed to remove the impedance generated momentum spread. Transverse instabilities
(beam breakup) should be controlled by rf BNS damping.

The heating of collider ring superconducting magnets by electrons from muon decay can be controlled by thick
tungsten shields, and this technique also shields the space surrounding the magnets from the induced radioactivity
on the inside of the shield wall. A conceptual design of magnets for the low energy machine has been deﬁned.

Although much work is yet to be done (inclusion of errors, higher order correction, magnet design, rf design, etc),

the collider ring does not appear likely to present a serious problem.

f. Neutrino radiation and detector background Neutrino radiation, which rises as the cube of the energy, is
not serious for machines with center of mass energies below about 1.5 TeV. It is thus not signiﬁcant for the First
Muon Collider; but above 2 TeV, it sets a constraint on the muon current and makes it harder to achieve desired
luminosities. However, advances in cooling and correction of tune shifts may still allow a machine at 10 TeV with
substantial luminosity (> 1035 cm−

2s−

1).

Background in the detector was at ﬁrst expected to be a very serious problem, but after much work, shielding
systems have evolved that limit most charged hadron, electron, gamma and neutron backgrounds to levels that are
acceptable. Muon background, in the higher energy machines, is a special problem that can cause serious ﬂuctuations
in calorimeter measurements. It has been shown that fast timing and segmentation can help suppress this background,
and preliminary studies of its eﬀects on a physics experiment are encouraging. The studies are ongoing.

g. Detector scenarios We have considered several options for the experimental detector components for various
CoM energy colliders. Much work needs to be done to optimize the physics reach at each energy by feeding back the
results of detailed simulations of backgrounds and signal to the detector design. Only then will the feasibility of doing
physics with a muon collider be fully explored.

h. Summary Much progress has been made since Snowmass, but much still needs to be done. A time scale of
two years should allow completion of simulation studies and the experimental testing of crucial technical challenges.
Prototype construction and testing will take another 4-6 years. The construction of a First Muon Collider by about
2010 does seems possible.

STUDY OF NEAR-FIELD VIBRATION SOURCES FOR THE NLC LINAC
COMPONENTS
F. Asiri, F. Le Pimpec, A. Seryi SLAC, CA USA ∗

Abstract

The vibration stability requirements for the Next Linear
Collider (NLC) are far more stringent than for the previous
generation of Colliders. To meet these goals, it is impera-
tive that the effects of vibration on NLC Linac components
from near-ﬁeld sources (e.g. compressors, high vacuum
equipment, klystrons, modulators, pumps, fans, etc) be
well understood. The civil construction method, whether
cut-and-cover or parallel bored tunnels, can determine the
proximity and possible isolation of noise sources. This pa-
per presents a brief summary and analysis of recently com-
pleted and planned studies for characterization of near-ﬁeld
vibration sources under either construction method. The
results of in-situ vibration measurements will also be in-
cluded.

INTRODUCTION
To maintain the desired luminosity of the NLC, the fo-
cusing components on the main Linac must be kept at a
few nanometers above a few Hz. These components can
be affected by far-ﬁeld (natural) and near-ﬁeld (man-made)
vibration sources. This paper is concerned only with near-
ﬁeld sources (e.g. mechanical and electrical equipment,
RF generating equipment, etc). These sources are mainly
located either in the Support tunnel, Fig.1, or far away
(> 100 m) from the Beam tunnel. The characterization
of near-ﬁeld vibration sources and its effects on the main
Linac components is part of an ongoing R&D program at
NLC that is presented in this paper. The ﬁrst part of the
paper will present the inﬂuence of the vibration induced by
RF power generating elements and by the RF itself. The
second part will deal with the transfer of vibration from
surface to the tunnel invert.

RF VIBRATION CHARACTERIZATION

At ﬁrst, we will focus on the vibration contribution of
high power generating RF components. The study was car-
ried out near the supporting structure of the 8 pack project
[1]. The 8 pack project is the test bench of klystrons and
their modulator to produce high power RF for the Next Lin-
ear Collider Test Accelerator (NLCTA). One of the geo-

phone sensors was placed at the base of the modulator at
76 cm above the concrete ﬂoor and the second one was lo-
cated on the concrete ﬂoor at ∼1.2 m away from the base
of the modulator support, or at its base (0 m). The signals
of the Mark-4 geophones were measured simultaneously.

We performed tests in two different conditions of the
modulator. In the ﬁrst case, the water cooled modulator was
under a 20 kV voltage and was running at 30 Hz or 10 Hz
(at this voltage the klystrons was not conducting, thus did
not deliver RF power). In the second case the modulator
was running at 10 Hz and was under 400 kV (the klystron
was delivering ∼40 MW of RF power at 1.6 µs).

Fig.2 shows the response of the sensors vs times for the
modulator under a 20 kV. In this case the modulator was
running at different frequencies. The seismometer located
at the base of the modulator clearly shows vibrations due
to modulator pulsed operation, while the geophone located
on the concrete ﬂoor does not indicate any change due to
the modulator running conditions.

was running at different frequencies or was switched off.
Note the difference of the scales.

Fourier analysis also does not reveal any additional
noises due to modulator on the ﬂoor. Fig.3 and Fig.4 show
the average integrated displacement (AID) of the two seis-
mometers. The blue lines are the response of the sensor
placed at the base of the modulator, where the difference
between the modulator on and off cases is clearly seen. The
green lines are the response of the sensor placed on the con-
crete ﬂoor either at ∼1.2 m or at the base of the stand (0 m),
and the on and off cases overlap.

Interesting that, when the modulator is under 400 kV and
delivering power to the klystron, its vibration is slightly less
than for a 20 kV running modulator. One can also note that
background noise was different in the conditions of Fig.3
and Fig.4 (see green curves below 60 Hz) which was due to
different level of activity of the construction crew working
at NLCTA.

The main conclusion of the modulator vibration study
is that the transmission of vibration from the modulator to
the concrete ﬂoor is not signiﬁcant, and, on the level of
background noise at NLCTA, not noticeable.

of the modulator and on the ﬂoor 0 m of the supporting

We also studied vibrations of accelerating structures due
to cooling water (reported earlier, see [2]), and due to RF
pulse (presented below). When the klystrons are delivering
power, the RF heating produces acoustical vibration in the
accelerating structure. Possible vibration produced by the
RF were measured by 3 piezo-accelerometers placed on the
accelerating travelling wave structure bolted on its support
or girder, placed on the girder, and placed on the waveg-
uide. The X-rays coming out from the structure when
ﬁlled by the RF did not affect the measurements of our ac-
celerometers.

These measurements, Fig.5, show that feeding a struc-
ture (60 cm long travelling wave structure H60Vg3R), via
its waveguide, with 100 MW at 400 ns of RF power at
60 Hz (corresponded to about 70 MV/m accelerating gradi-
ent) does not lead to any signiﬁcant increase of vibration in

comparison to vibrations produced by cooling water. The
water induced vibrations dominate, but they are tolerable,
since, with an appropriate design, the vibration transmis-
sion to the linac quadrupoles is rather small [2]. Vibration
of the loosely supported RF waveguide is higher than of
the RF structure, but apparently this does not signiﬁcantly
increase vibration of either structure or the quadrupoles.

VIBRATION TRANSFER FROM SURFACE
TO BEAM TUNNEL

One of the questions to be addressed is whether there is
a signiﬁcant difference in the vibration attenuation charac-
teristics between a tunnel bored at great depth (in bedrock)
or excavated in cut-and-cover construction at lesser depth,
with regard to vibrations generated at the surface. A study
was carried out at SLAC [3], representing the vibration at-
tenuation characteristics of the soil, assuming the SLAC
beam line housing to be representative of a cut-and-cover
construction. The second vibration measurement study is
currently underway in the Red Line tunnels in Los Ange-
les. This study will establish the vibration characteristics
between two tunnels, along the tunnel as well as from sur-
face to the tunnel. The following is a brief presentation of
data from the study carried out at SLAC.

Figure 6: Relative locations of sources and receptors (scale
in feet).

Fig.6 shows the relative locations of sources and the re-
ceivers. The receivers locations were on the ﬂoor along the

centerline of the beam. The sources were on the ground
surface. Drive location S1 was at the same approximate
elevation as of the Klystron gallery ﬂoor, which lies about
36 ft ( 11 m) above the elevation of the receiver locations.
Drive location S2 was about 10 ft ( 3 m) uphill from S1.

Fig.8 shows a smoothed spectra which were calculated
by log averaging the amplitudes over a 10 Hz interval cen-
tered on the plotted point. It provides the transfer function
(showing change of amplitude) measured at R1 to R5 using
S1 as a drive point, Fig.6.

Table 1: Attenuation factor, refering to Fig.6.

The Table 1 summarizes the apparent attenuation at sev-
eral frequencies at which mechanical equipment usually
operates. The ﬁgures in Table 1 represent the attenuation
factor A for a vibration with its source near S1 propagat-
ing along the same path. Let us give an example how such
data can be used. Suppose a pump is installed at S1, and
it produces vibrations at 30 Hz of amplitude X. The ampli-
tude at 30 Hz that we would measure at R5 would be the
greater of either ambient or 0.0009X. Suppose we take the
ambient measured shown for the tunnel in (Fig.7) as repre-
sentative the tunnel in general. The amplitude at 30 Hz is
about 1.5 µm/s. If we were to place a pump at S1 and be
sure to avoid having its vibrations exceed ambient at R5,
we would need to impose a limit on the resulting vibration
at S1 of 1.5/0.0009=1.7 mm/s.

CONCLUSION

It has been shown that the vibration transmitted by
the RF generating equipment to the ﬂoor is insigniﬁcant.
Hence, klystrons and or modulators running in the Sup-
port tunnel of the NLC should not effect alignment of the
Linac. Vibration contribution of an RF pulse to an accel-
erating structure has also been found negligible relative to
water-cooling. Thus, it leaves electrical and mechanical
rotating equipment as possibly a dominating source of vi-
bration. The attenuation factors presented in the paper can
be used in planning stage of the NLC project for specifying
and locating the mechanical rotating equipment, as well as
to assess their vibration effects on the focusing components
on the Main Linac and provide a means for establishing the
vibration budgeting scheme for the project.

Figure 7: Typical response at R1 to hammer blow at S1,
with ambient at R1.

Fig.7 shows two spectra. One is the ambient measured at
the receiver location R1. The other is a fast Fourier trans-
form of the response to several hammer blows. Several
observations may be made. The peaks at 60 Hz and 120 Hz
are electronic artefacts. The peaks centered at ∼8.75 Hz
and at ∼14.25 Hz in both ambient and response have a
nearly identical amplitudes. The peak at 18.75 Hz has a
slightly different amplitude. At these frequencies, the “re-
sponse” (red line) is being governed more by ambient than
by the input force, so the transfer functions derived from
the “response” will be invalid. The “ambient” (blue line) at
frequencies less than 7 Hz (in this case) lies above the “re-
sponse”. This suggests that there is some variability to the
ambient environment at these low frequencies, and these
will degrade the accuracy of transmission function at lower
frequencies.

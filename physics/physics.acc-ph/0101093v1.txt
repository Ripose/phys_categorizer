Analytical Formula for Weak Multi-Bunch Beam
Break-Up in a Linac

Karl L.F. Bane and Zenghai Li

In designing linac structures for multi-bunch applications we are often in-
terested in estimating the eﬀect of relatively weak multi-bunch beam break-
up (BBU), due to the somewhat complicated wakeﬁelds of detuned struc-
tures. This, for example, is the case for the injector linacs of the JLC/NLC
linear collider project (see Ref. [1]). Deriving an analytical formula for such
a problem is the subject of this report. Note that the more studied multi-
bunch BBU problem, i.e. the eﬀect on a bunch train of a single strong mode,
the so-called “cumulative beam break-up instability” (see, e.g. Ref. [2]), is a
somewhat diﬀerent problem, and one for which the approach presented here
is probably not very useful.

In Ref. [3] an analytical formula for single-bunch beam break-up in a
smooth focusing linac, for the case without energy spread in the beam, is
derived, the so-called Chao-Richter-Yao (CRY) model for beam break-up.
Suppose the beam is initially oﬀset from the accelerator axis. The beam
break-up downstream is characterized by a strength parameter Υ(t, s), where
t represents position within the bunch, and s position along the linac. When
Υ(t, s) is small compared to 1, the growth in betatron amplitude in the linac
is proportional to this parameter. When applied to the special case of a
uniform longitudinal charge distribution, and a linearly growing wakeﬁeld,
In this case the
the result of the calculation becomes especially simple.
growth in orbit amplitude is given as an asymptotic power series in Υ(t, s),
and the series can be summed to give a closed form, asymptotic solution for
single-bunch BBU. The derivation of an analytic formula for multi-bunch
BBU is almost a trivial modiﬁcation of the CRY formalism. We will here
reproduce the important features of the single-bunch derivation of Ref. [3]
(with slightly modiﬁed notation), and then show how it can be modiﬁed to
obtain a result applicable to multi-bunch BBU.

Let us consider the case of single-bunch beam break-up, where a beam
is initially oﬀset by distance y0 in a linac with acceleration and smooth
focusing. We assume that there is no energy spread within the beam. The

with y(t, s) the bunch oﬀset, a function of position within the bunch t, and
position along the linac s; with E the beam energy, [1/β(s)] the betatron
wave number, eNt the total bunch charge, λt(t) the longitudinal charge
distribution, and W (t) the short-range dipole wakeﬁeld. Our convention is
that negative values of t are toward the front of the bunch. Let us, for the
moment, limit ourselves to the problem of no acceleration and β a constant.
A. Chao in Ref. [3] expands the solution to the equation of motion for this
problem in a perturbation series

with the ﬁrst term given by free betatron oscillation [y(0) = y0 cos(s/β)]. He
then shows that the solution for the higher terms at position s = L, after
many betatron oscillations, is given by

and R0(z) = 1. An observable y is meant to be the real part of Eq. 2.
The eﬀects of adiabatic acceleration, i.e. suﬃciently slow acceleration so
that the energy doubling distance is large compared to the betatron wave
length, and β not constant, can be added by simply replacing (β/E) in
Eq. 3 by hβ/Ei, where angle brackets indicate averaging along the linac
from s = 0 to s = L.1 For example, if the lattice is such that β ∼ Eζ
1Note that the terms y0eiL/β in Eq. 3, related to free betatron oscillation, also need
to be modiﬁed in well-known ways to reﬂect the dependence of β on E. It is the other
terms, however, which characterize BBU, in which we are interested.

then hβ/Ei = (β0/E0)g(Ef /E0, ζ), where subscripts “0” and “f ” signify,
respectively, initial and ﬁnal parameters, and

g(x, ζ) =

[β ∼ Eζ].

Chao then shows that for certain simple combinations of bunch shape and
wake function shape the integrals in Eq. 4 can be performed analytically, and
the result becomes an asymptotic series in powers of a strength parameter.
For example, for the case of a uniform charge distribution of length ℓ (with
the front of the bunch at t = 0), and a wake that varies as W = W ′t, the
strength parameter is

Υ(t, L) =

g(Ef /E0, ζ)

.

If Υ is small compared to 1, the growth is well approximated by Υ. If Υ
is large, the sum over all terms can be performed to give a closed form,
asymptotic expression.

For multi-bunch BBU we are mainly concerned with the interaction of
the diﬀerent bunches in the train, and will ignore wakeﬁeld forces within
bunches. The derivation is nearly identical to that for the single-bunch
BBU. However, in the equation of motion, Eq. 1, the independent variable
t is no longer a continuous variable, but rather t takes on discrete values
tm = m∆t, where m is a bunch index and ∆t is the bunch spacing. Also, W
now represents the long-range wakeﬁeld. Let us assume that there are M ,
equally populated bunches in a train; i.e. Nt = M N , with N the particles
per bunch. The solution is again expanded in a perturbation series. In the
solution, Eq. 3, the Rn(t), which are smooth functions of t, are replaced by

(with R0
m. Note that R(1)

j = 1), which is a function of a discrete parameter, the bunch index

m = Sm/M , with Sm the sum wake.

Generally the sums in Eq. 7 cannot be given in closed form, and there-
fore a closed, asymptotic expression for multi-bunch BBU cannot be given.
We can still, however, numerically compute the individual terms equivalent
to Eq. 3 for the single bunch case. For example, the ﬁrst order term in
amplitude growth is given by

Υm =

e2N LSmβ0

g(Ef /E0, ζ)

[m = 1, . . . , M ] .

If this term is small compared to 1 for all m, then BBU is well characterized
by Υ. If it is not small, though not extremely large, the next higher terms can
be computed and their contribution added. For Υ very large, this approach
may not be very useful.

From our derivation we see that there is nothing that fundamentally
distinguishes our BBU solution from a single-bunch BBU solution.
If we
consider again the single-bunch calculation, for the case of a uniform charge
distribution of length ℓ, we see that we need to perform the integrations
for Rn in Eq. 4.
If we do the integrations numerically, by dividing the
integrals into discrete steps tn = (n − 1)∆t and then performing quadrature
by rectangular rule, we end up with Eq. 7 with M = ℓ/∆t. The solution is
the same as our multi-bunch solution. What distinguishes the multi-bunch
from the single-bunch problem is that the wakeﬁeld for the multi-bunch case
is not normally monotonic and does not vary smoothly with longitudinal
position. For such a case it may be more diﬃcult to decide how many terms
are needed for the sum to converge.

In Fig. 1 we give a numerical example: the NLC prelinac with the op-
timized 3π/4 S-band structure, but with 10−5 systematic frequency errors,
with the nominal (2.8 ns) bunch spacing (see Ref. [1]). The diamonds give
the ﬁrst order (a) and the second order (b) perturbation terms. The crosses
in (a) give the results of a smooth focusing simulation program (taking
β ∼ E1/2), where the free betatron term has been removed. We see that the
agreement is very good; i.e. the ﬁrst order term is a good approximation
to the simulation results. In (b) we note that the next order term is much
smaller.

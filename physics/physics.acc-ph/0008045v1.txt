MULTIRESOLUTION REPRESENTATION FOR ORBITAL DYNAMICS IN

MULTIPOLAR FIELDS

A. Fedorova, M. Zeitlin, IPME, RAS, V.O. Bolshoj pr., 61, 199178, St. Petersburg, Russia ∗†

Abstract
We present the applications of variation – wavelet analysis
to polynomial/rational approximations for orbital motion in
transverse plane for a single particle in a circular magnetic
lattice in case when we take into account multipolar expan-
sion up to an arbitrary ﬁnite number and additional kick
terms. We reduce initial dynamical problem to the ﬁnite
number (equal to the number of n-poles) of standard alge-
braical problems. We have the solution as a multiresolution
(multiscales) expansion in the base of compactly supported
wavelet basis.

INTRODUCTION

In this paper we consider the applications of a new numeri-
cal-analytical technique which is based on the methods of
local nonlinear harmonic analysis or wavelet analysis to the
orbital motion in transverse plane for a single particle in a
circular magnetic lattice in case when we take into account
multipolar expansion up to an arbitrary ﬁnite number and
additional kick terms. We reduce initial dynamical prob-
lem to the ﬁnite number (equal to the number of n-poles) of
standard algebraical problems and represent all dynamical
variables as expansion in the bases of maximally localized
in phase space functions (wavelet bases). Wavelet analysis
is a relatively novel set of mathematical methods, which
gives us a possibility to work with well-localized bases in
functional spaces and gives for the general type of opera-
tors (differential, integral, pseudodifferential) in such bases
the maximum sparse forms. Our approach in this paper is
based on the generalization of variational-wavelet approach
from [1]-[8], which allows us to consider not only polyno-
mial but rational type of nonlinearities [9]. The solution
has the following form

z(t) = zslow

N (t) + Xj≥N

zj(ωjt), ωj ∼ 2j

(1)

N

which corresponds to the full multiresolution expansion in
all time scales. Formula (1) gives us expansion into a slow
part zslow
and fast oscillating parts for arbitrary N. So, we
may move from coarse scales of resolution to the ﬁnest one
for obtaining more detailed information about our dynami-
cal process. The ﬁrst term in the RHS of equation (1) corre-
sponds on the global level of function space decomposition
to resolution space and the second one to detail space. In
this way we give contribution to our full solution from each
scale of resolution or each time scale. The same is correct

† http://www.ipme.ru/zeitlin.html; http://www.ipme.nw.ru/zeitlin.html

for the contribution to power spectral density (energy spec-
trum): we can take into account contributions from each
level/scale of resolution. Starting in part 2 from Hamilto-
nian of orbital motion in magnetic lattice with additional
kicks terms, we consider in part 3 variational formulation
for dynamical system with rational nonlinearities and con-
struct via multiresolution analysis explicit representation
for all dynamical variables in the base of compactly sup-
ported wavelets.

FIELD

The magnetic vector potential of a magnet with 2n poles in
Cartesian coordinates is

where fn is a homogeneous function of x and y of order n.
The real and imaginary parts of binomial expansion of

fn(x, y) = (x + iy)n

(3)

correspond to regular and skew multipoles. The cases
n = 2 to n = 5 correspond to low-order multipoles:
quadrupole, sextupole, octupole, decapole. The corre-
sponding Hamiltonian ([10] for designation):

Then we may take into account arbitrary but ﬁnite number
of terms in expansion of RHS of Hamiltonian (4) and from
our point of view the corresponding Hamiltonian equations
of motions are not more than nonlinear ordinary differen-
tial equations with polynomial nonlinearities and variable
coefﬁcients. Also we may add the terms corresponding to
kick type contributions of rf-cavity:

is obvious that the initial system and the system

are equivalent. Of course, we consider such Qi(x) which
do not lead to the singular problem with Qi(x), when t = 0

3 RATIONAL DYNAMICS

The ﬁrst main part of our consideration is some variational
approach to this problem, which reduces initial problem to
the problem of solution of functional equations at the ﬁrst
stage and some algebraical problems at the second stage.
We have the solution in a compactly supported wavelet ba-
sis. Multiresolution expansion is the second main part of
our construction. The solution is parameterized by solu-
tions of two reduced algebraical problems, one is nonlin-
ear and the second are some linear problems, which are
obtained from one of the next wavelet constructions: the
method of Connection Coefﬁcients (CC), Stationary Sub-
division Schemes (SSS).

3.1 Variational Method

Our problems may be formulated as the systems of ordi-
nary differential equations

Qi(x)

dxi
dt

= Pi(x, t),

x = (x1, ..., xn),

(6)

i = 1, ..., n, max

i

deg Pi = p, max

i

deg Qi = q

with ﬁxed initial conditions xi(0), where Pi, Qi are not
more than polynomial functions of dynamical variables xj
and have arbitrary dependence of time. Because of time di-
lation we can consider only next time interval: 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.

λ = {λi} = {λr

i } = (λ1

i , λ2

i , ..., λN

i ),

(11)

where the lower index i corresponds to expansion of dy-
namical variable with index i, i.e. xi and the upper index
r corresponds to the numbers of terms in the expansion of
dynamical variables in the formal series. Then we put (10)
into the functional equations (9) and as result we have the
following reduced algebraical system of equations on the
set of unknown coefﬁcients λk

i of expansions (10):

L(Qij, λ, αI ) = M (Pij , λ, βJ ),

(12)

where operators L and M are algebraization of RHS and
LHS of initial problem (6), where λ (11) are unknowns of
reduced system of algebraical equations (RSAE)(12).

Qij are coefﬁcients (with possible time dependence) of
LHS of initial system of differential equations (6) and as
consequence are coefﬁcients of RSAE.

Pij are coefﬁcients (with possible time dependence) of
RHS of initial system of differential equations (6) and as
consequence are coefﬁcients of RSAE.

I = (i1, ..., iq+2), J = (j1, ..., jp+1) are multiindexes,
by which are labelled αI and βI — other coefﬁcients of
RSAE (12):

βJ = {βj1...jp+1} = Z Y1≤jk≤p+1

ϕjk ,

(13)

where p is the degree of polinomial operator P (6)

αI = {αi1 ...αiq+2 } = Xi1,...,iq+2

Z ϕi1 ... ˙ϕis ...ϕiq+2 ,

(14)

where q is the degree of polynomial operator Q (6), iℓ =
(1, ..., q + 2),

˙ϕis = dϕis /dt.

Now, when we solve RSAE (12) and determine unknown
coefﬁcients from formal expansion (10) we therefore ob-
tain the solution of our initial problem. It should be noted
if we consider only truncated expansion (10) with N terms
then we have from (12) the system of N × n algebraical
equations with degree ℓ = max{p, q} and the degree of
this algebraical system coincides with degree of initial dif-
ferential system. So, we have the solution of the initial
nonlinear (rational) problem in the form

where coefﬁcients λk
i are roots of the corresponding re-
duced algebraical (polynomial) problem RSAE (12). Con-
sequently, we have a parametrization of solution of initial
problem by solution of reduced algebraical problem (12).
The ﬁrst main problem is a problem of computations of
coefﬁcients αI (14), βJ (13) of reduced algebraical sys-
tem. These problems may be explicitly solved in wavelet
approach.

Next we consider the construction of explicit time solu-
tion for our problem. The obtained solutions are given in
the form (15), where Xk(t) are basis functions and λi
k are
roots of reduced system of equations. In our case Xk(t) are
obtained via multiresolution expansions and represented by
k are the roots of corre-
compactly supported wavelets and λi
sponding general polynomial system (12) with coefﬁcients,
which are given by CC or SSS constructions. According to
the variational method to give the reduction from differen-
tial to algebraical system of equations we need compute the
objects αI and βJ [1],[9].

Our constructions are based on multiresolution appro-
ach. Because afﬁne group of translation and dilations is
inside the approach, this method resembles the action of a
microscope. We have contribution to ﬁnal result from each
scale of resolution from the whole inﬁnite scale of spaces.
More exactly, the closed subspace Vj(j ∈ Z) corresponds
to level j of resolution, or to scale j. We consider a mul-
tiresolution analysis of L2(Rn) (of course, we may con-
sider any different functional space) which is a sequence of
increasing closed subspaces Vj:

...V−2 ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ ...

(16)

satisfying the following properties:

\j∈Z

Vj = 0, [j∈Z

Vj = L2(Rn),

On Fig.3 we present contributions to solution of initial
problem from ﬁrst 5 scales or levels of resolution.

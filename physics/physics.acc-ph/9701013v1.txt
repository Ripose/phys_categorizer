Abstract

It is shown that high accelerating gradient can be obtained in a specially constructed

system of electron (positron) bunches, moving in cold plasma with deﬁnite density. These

combined bunch systems do not generate the wake ﬁelds behind them and can pass

through the plasma column in a periodic sequence. The consideration is carried out

numericaly and analyticaly in one dimensional approach, (which can be applied to ﬁnite

system when its transverse dimensions are larger than plasma wave length, divided by

2π). The possibilities of the experimental tests by measuring the predicted energy gain

are discussed on the examples of Argonne Wakeﬁeld Accelerator and induction linac with

typical parameters.

1 INTRODUCTION

Langmuir already noticed, that the beam, which has passed the plasma column, contains

a signiﬁcant portion of electrons with the energies higher than the initial energy of the

1

beam. In the recent times various groups (see e.g. [1]-[3]) also observed experimentally

the eﬀect of the selfacceleration.

The possibility to accelerate the electrons of the bunches, moving in plasma, was

considered numericaly in [4], [5] and some attempts of the analytical treatment of the

problem have been performed in [6]- [9].

In the work [10], which is based on the previous results [11] used as a zero order ap-

proximation, nonlinear dynamics of the one-dimensional non rigid ultrarelativistic bunch

of electrons, moving in the cold plasma, is considered by multiple scales perturbative

approach. Square root of the inverse Lorentz factor of the bunch electrons is taken as a

small parameter.

It was shown [10], in particular, that for specialy constructed system consisted from

two bunches, ﬁrst one dense enough n(1)

multiple scales method, the change of the momentum of the bunches electrons is given

by △pb = −eEt, where t is a acceleration (deacceleration) time interval which, due to
applicability of the multiple scales method, is t ≤ ω−1

p γ1/2.

The essential restriction on the acceleration rate in the considered cases comes from

the steady state assumption adopted in [10]. If plasma electrons momenta in the wake

ﬁeld behind the ﬁrst dense relativistic bunch, moving in underdense plasma, exciedes same

critical value, allowed by steady state assumption, the plasma electron density behind

the bunch turn out to be negative, which probably means that wake wave breaking limit

is achieved. Restriction on the plasma electrons momenta inside the bunch automatically

restricts the maximum value of the generated electric ﬁeld.

In the present work another proper combination of the charged particles (e±) bunches

is proposed, which is constructed in such a way, that it does not generate the wake

ﬁelds behind the combined bunch at all. The plasma electrons momenta, inside the

combined bunch being negative, remains in the allowed domain and their maximum

value is restricted only by the total momentum conservation low. The maximum of the

2

subsequent electric ﬁeld then also can be large enough.

The combined bunch in the considered case consists (at least) of three parts:ﬁrst one

is a relativistic negative particles bunch, with density n(1)

2n0, which generates in a
plasma inside the bunch strong electric ﬁeld, which brakes the bunch particles (generator).
The second bunch is a low density bunch with particles n(2)

2n0 (it can be negative
particles bunch, positive particles bunch), which inverts the sign of the electric ﬁeld

b ≫ 1

b < 1

generated by the ﬁrst bunch (invertor). The third bunch with the parameters, which can

coincide with that of the ﬁrst one, provided on its rear part the zero values of electric

ﬁeld and plasma electrons momenta, coincided with the same values on the front of

the ﬁrst bunch (damper). It means that plasma behind the system of bunches remains

unperturbed and no wake ﬁeld is generated.

Acceleration of the particles of the rear part of the second and of the third bunches,

where electric ﬁeld is negative, will take place. The goal of the following calculations is

to estimate the maximum possible values of the acceleration parameter.

In the next section of the work the vivid approach to the problem, based on the nu-

merical solutions of the subsequent nonlinear equations and their graphic representations

on phase plane are presented. The third section devoted to the analytical treatment of

the problem, which based on the exact solutions of the equations and provides the general

expressions for the energy gain, acceleration rate and acceleration length, the lengths of

the diﬀerent parts of the combined bunch as a functions of charge densities and Lorentz-

factor of the bunches. Finally, the numerical examples are presented, which consider the

possibilities of the experimental observations of the predicted selfacceleration of charged

particles, in particular, on Argonne Wakeﬁeld Accelerator (AWA) and induction linacs.

it is also periodic for 0 ≤ α ≤ 1/2, and non periodic for α > 1/2 [11].

Fig. 2, 3, 4 represent the phase plane (Φ′, Φ) portrait of the system of cold plasma-rigid

charged particle bunch in the cases, when α = −10, 0.4, 10 and γ = 10 at diﬀerent

boundary conditions (diﬀerent E). The closed phase trajectories correspond to periodic

Trajectories on Fig. 2, 3, 4 can serve as a building blocks to construct the phase

portraits of the combined bunches, moving in cold plasma. It must be represented by a
closed loop, starts from the boundary condition Φ = 1, Φ′ = 0 and accomplished at the
same point Φ = 1, Φ′ = 0 on the phase plane. An example of such a loop is presented on
Fig. 5. The loop on Fig. 5b from the point 0 : Φ = 1, Φ′ = 0 (ρe = 0, ve = 0, E = 0,

when ˜z = d) and the curve OA represents the motion of the bunch of negative charged

particles (generator) α(1) = 10, when at the rear side of the bunch very strong but positive
electric ﬁeld E0 = −Φ′ can be generated. Taking this point as a new boundary conditions

for the second bunch of positive charged particles (invertor), the trajectory is turned to
the point B, where electric ﬁeld is zero and then to the point A′ where the ﬁeld −E0 is
obtained. From point A′ to the point 0 the trajectory described the motion of the third

7

bunch of the negatively charged particles (damper) on the rear side of which the initial

boundary conditions exist. It means that no wake ﬁeld excites and the plasma behind the

third bunch remains unperturbed. As a consequence, the above mentioned restriction on

the value of the ﬁeld E0, which arouse from the condition of the stability of the wake ﬁeld,

is removed.

open the possibility to repeat more than once the procedure, sending the next combined

The example of such a combination is presented on Fig. 6a, 6b, where electric ﬁeld and

phase portrait are drawn for the case, when

b = n(3)
n(1)

b = 10n0, n(2)

b = 0.4n0, γ = 100.

It is seen from Fig. 6a, that the length d2 of the second bunch-invertor is too large

in considered case. Acceleration of the bunches electrons take place when E < 0 i.e.

mostly in the rear side of the second bunch-invertor and, at some extend, in the third

bunch-damper.

The role of the bunch-invertor may play also the plasma itself (n(2)

b = 0). In such a

case the electric ﬁeld interacts on plasma electrons, which are moving in the direction

opposite to that of bunch, with the initial velocity equal to zero. So they will accelerate

in the region where E > 0, and drag in the region where E < 0. The electrons of the

third bunch, where E > 0 will accelerate. The charge distribution inside the bunches can

be nonuniform.

On Figs. 7a, 7b the results of the numerical solution of eqs. (1-3) are displayed for

the case of sinusoidal charge distribution inside the electron- positron-electron bunches

It is neccessary to note that the wake ﬁeld behind the combined bunch due to small in-

accuracies, presented in actual calculations practically exists, but the amplitude of this

wake is small and far from wave breacking limit. This last condition deﬁnes the tolerances

on the parameters of combined bunch and must be taken into account in actual calcula-

tions for the proposed experimental tests. In the case of the sequence of the combined

bunches, passing through plasma, the conditions, which deﬁne the tolerances on bunch

parameters, will be more severe.

3 ANALYTICAL APPROACH

bined bunch with the uniform charge distributions inside the constituting bunches are

presented. Results for single rigid (electron) bunch with the zero boundary conditions

As it was shown in [10] the change of the bunch electron momenta △p, in the ﬁrst

According to (26) it is possible to obtain essential acceleration ﬁelds when the previ-

ously accelerated dense bunches of negative charged particles (electrons) are used. The

lengths of such a bunches, according to (29), imcreases as ∼ γ1/2, so it seems that they

must be the bunches from high current accelerators with the energies up to tens of Mev.

Even at these energies maximal acceleration gradient is high enough, it can exceed the

acceleration gradient of the ordinary linacs by a several orders of magnitude.

Consider the experimental possibilities of proof-of-principle experiment on existing

accelerators or test facilities.

It seems that Argonne Wakeﬁeld Accelerators (AWA),

which accelerates very dense bunches, is suitable for above mentioned proposes.

AWA [17] is 20MeV electron accelerator which accelerate the bunches of 20p sec full

width (the length d1exp = 0.6cm), diameter about 0.1cm [18], the total charge of the
b = 4 · 1013cm−3, then
bunch 100nC, i.e. n(1)
the optimal length of the ﬁrst bunch from (29) is d1 = 2.4cm, i.e. 4 times larger than the

b = 2 · 1014cm−3. If n0 is choosen as n0 = 1

5n(1)

experimentally existing one d1exp = 0.6cm.

The role of the invertor can serve the plasma column itself. Witness bunch, which

has 10ps duration, less than 1nC total charge, and energy 4Mev can be used as accel-

erated bunch, being placed somewhere between ﬁrst and third bunches. Third bunch

(damper) has similiar parameters as the ﬁrst one and must be placed at distance d2 =

d1 ≈ 43cm from the end of the ﬁrst bunch. Experimentally it is possible

to put it on the distance d2exp = 46cm, because the frequency of the RF-cavities is

ν = 1.3GHz

(d2exp = nc/ν = n · 23cm, n = 1, 2, 3, · · ·). If the length of the ﬁrst bunch

could be made 4 times large than existing one and total charge of the bunch will be also 4

times larger-400nC, then the change of the energy of the witness bunch will be, according

For the existing experimental parameters of AWA:d1 = 0, 5cm, d2 = 23cm, total
b = 1.4 · 1014cm−3 results of the numerical calculations, along
the lines presented in Sec. 2, are shown on ﬁgures 8a and 8b. The role of bunch-invertor

plays the plasma column, with density n0 as a free parameter, which was been chosen

from the necessity to invert the ﬁeld, produced by the ﬁrst bunch, in such a way, that

the succesive bunch, with the same parameters as the ﬁrst one, moving at ﬁxed (by

RF-frequency) distance from the ﬁrst one, d2 = 23cm, will be able to dump the ﬁeld to
zero. The sought density of plasma n0 was found equal to n0 ≈ 1.17 · 1013cm−3, λp =

0.973cm, nb/n0 = 11.95. Then the maximum value of the accelerated electric ﬁeld is

equal to Emax ≈ 100Mv/cm, and E < 0 on the rear part of the second (third) bunch.

So about the half of the electrons of the second (third) bunch, as it can be seen from
Fig. 8a, can be accelerated during the time t ∼ ω−1

p γ1/2 up to energy Ef ≈ 70MeV.

Fig. 8b. Phase-plane portrait for proposed experiment on AWA.  

Proposed experiment can serve as a prof-of-principle one;plasma remains practically un-

perturbed after the passage of the ﬁrst and the second bunches, so it is possible to inject

the next couple of the bunches and also obtain acceleration, again leaving the plasma

behind the bunches in practically unperturbed state and so on. As it was above men-

tioned in order to obtain the optimal experimental conditions, it is necessary to enlarge

the micropulse duration, leaving its charge density the same. This will rise the maximum

16

obtainable electric ﬁeld and energy gain. Of course, the obtained numbers for Emax and

E are at some extent tentative;it is neccessary to remember that they are obtained in the

model of the bunch with the inﬁnite transverse dimensions and uniform charge distribu-

tion. More detailed calculations must be performed in the course of preparation of the

experiment.

However, taking into account the results of the numerical calculation for laser driven

wake ﬁelds in generalized vortex-free plasma [19], it is possible to adopt the statement of

authors [19], that ”even when driver’s width approaches c/ωp the 1-D (nonlinear theory)

predictions are still a good guide for determining the accelerating ﬁeld strength”. In the

considered case of AWA the diameter of the bunch is D = 0.1cm ≤ c
ωp

2π = 0.15cm,
so for the existing parameters of AWA predictions of 1-D nonlinear theory can be valid.
For the improved parameters of AWA, as it was shown, n0 = 4 · 1013cm−3 and D =

= λp

0.1cm ≥ c
ωp

= λp

2π = 0.08cm and the situation is more favourable.

For Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) at BNL the situation in the considered respect is

worse, due to the very narrow bunches r = 0.03cm and smaller bunch charge Q = 2nC

[20]. At any case, the considered problem needs the development of 2-D nonlinear theory

of wake ﬁeld generation by the electron (positron) bunches with the ﬁnite transverse

dimension.

Another possibility to check the predicted eﬀect is based on the use of induction linacs.

Consider the example of the accelerator with the parameters, which are within the range

of the possibilities of the existing or planned induction linacs (see e.g. [15], [16]): Energy

E = 16MeV

Pulse current

I = 5kA

Pulse duration

τ = 2.5nsec

Diameter of the bunch D = 2cm
Then the charge density of the ﬁrst and third bunches will be n(1)

plasma density can be chosen as n0 = 1

b = 1.6 · 1011cm−3, the
and then, according to (29, d1 ≈ 75cm, the

distance between second and third bunches, according to (30), is d2 ≈ 13.4m (the plasma

column plays the role of invertor). The maximum energy gain of the witness bunch of

17

much smaller current (e.g. 0.1 I and τ < 2.5nsec), placed in the proper position between

the ﬁrst and third bunches, according to (27), is

△E max = 4 · 5 · 16 = 320MeV.

The condition of the applicability of the 1-D nonlinear thery in this case is practically

fulﬁled:

D = 2cm ≤

= 2.3cm.

λp
2π

If the positron bunch can be used as a second invertor bunch with the same current

I as the ﬁrst one, then the length d2, according to (31), can be essentially reduced-
dp
2 = 134.1cm, and the part of positrons from this bunch can be accelerated, up to the

energies ≈ 300MeV.

It is evident, that in all cases considered, the length of the plasma column must be

2-3 times larger than the total length of the combined bunch, due to transient eﬀects.

The increase of the lengths of the bunches with the energy may be considered as tol-

erable one, when the extended astrophysical objects, as e.g. supernovae, are considered.

Then proposed mechanism can be applied, for example, even for the explanation of the

origin of the superhigh energy cosmic rays. This problem (see e.g. [21]) is now the most

important one for the astrophysics of cosmic rays with the energies E > 1017eV, when all

known mechanisms of cosmic rays acceleration are uneﬀective [22].

In order to illustrate this possibility consider the following numerical example. Sup-

pose that the ﬂux of electrons with the initial energy Ei = 5 · 1016eV already ob-

tained by some eﬀective and commonly adopted mechanism. The ﬂux with the den-
b = 1.5 · 1014cm−3 passes through the electron-proton plasma with the density
sity n(1)
n0 = 3 · 1011cm−3. Then it followed by positron (2) and electron (3) ﬂuxes with the same
densities n(2)

. Then some part of positron and third-electron bunches can

b = n(3)
be accelerated up to ﬁnal energy

b = n(1)

i.e. reaches the atmost limit of the observed cosmic rays. The length of the electron ﬂuxes

is 140km, the length of the positron bunch is 25km. (Let us mention that up to now

observed events at such energies are very rare). Considered example is only illustrative

and aplicability of the proposed mechanism to the problem of the origin of the superhigh

energy cosmic rays needs, of course, more careful consideration.

In addition, it is necessary to mention,that the expression for momentum change

(27) △p = −eEt, obtained for the ﬁrst approximation of the developed multiple scales

method,is valid up to ﬁfth approximation:

pb

≡ ρb = ρb0 + ǫρb1 + ǫ5ρb5 + ǫ6ρb6 + · · · ,

ǫ = γ

,

(32)

as it follows from the results of [10]. Hence it is possible to assume,that eq. (27) is valid
for the time intervals larger than ωpt ≤ ǫ−1 = γ1/2 used in the present work for estimites.

But in order to proof this assumption it is necessary to develop more complicated version

of multiple scales method, than used in [10], where only three scales are introduced:

˜z = z − β0t,

τ1 = ǫt,

ζ1 = ǫz.

Enlargement of the validity domain on t needs consideration of the contributions from

the next scales

τ2 = ǫ2t,

τ3 = ǫ3t,

τ4 = ǫ4t

to the momentum development (32).

This paper is devoted to the investigation of the radiation energy losses of an ultra-
relativistic charged particle channeling along a crystal plane which is periodically bent
by a transverse acoustic wave.
In such a system there are two essential mechanisms
leading to the photon emission. The ﬁrst one is the ordinary channeling radiation. This
radiation is generated as a result of the transverse oscillatory motion of the particle in the
channel. The second one is the acoustically induced radiation. This radiation is emitted
because of the periodic bending of the particle’s trajectory created by the acoustic wave.
The general formalism described in our work is applicable for the calculation of the
total radiative losses accounting for the contributions of both radiation mechanisms. We
analyze the relative importance of the two mechanisms at various amplitudes and lengths
of the acoustic wave and the energy of the projectile particle. We establish the ranges of
projectile particle energies, in which total energy loss is small for the LiH, C, Si, Ge, Fe
and W crystals. This result is important for the determination of the projectile particle
energy region, in which acoustically induced radiation of the undulator type and also the
stimulated photon emission can be eﬀectively generated. The latter eﬀects have been
described in our previous works.

1. Introduction

This paper is devoted to the investigation of the radiation energy losses of an
ultra-relativistic charged particle channeling along a crystal plane which is period-
ically bent by a transverse acoustic wave. In such a system, there are two essential
mechanisms leading to the photon emission. The ﬁrst one is the ordinary channel-
ing radiation. This radiation is generated as a result of the transverse oscillatory
motion of the particle in the channel. This radiation mechanism was suggested in
Refs. 1,2 for linear crystals and later studied in numerous theoretical and exper-
imental works (see e.g. Refs. 3,4,5). The second one is the acoustically induced

radiation (AIR)6,7. The AIR is emitted because of the periodic bending of the
particle’s trajectory created by the acoustic wave. This mechanism is of particular
interest, because the AIR has all the features of the undulator radiation, including
the possibility of the stimulated photon emission6,7.

Since the mechanism of AIR generation was suggested only recently, let us de-

scribe it here in more details. This mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 1.

respectively.

Under the action of a transverse acoustic wave propagating along the z-direction,
which deﬁnes the center line of an initially straight channel (not plotted in the ﬁgure)
the channel becomes periodically bent. Provided certain conditions are fulﬁlled6,7,
the beam of positrons, which enters the crystal at a small incident angle with respect
to the curved crystallographic plane, will penetrate through the crystal following the
bendings of its channel. It results in the transverse oscillations of the beam particles
while travelling along the z axis. These oscillations become an eﬀective source
of spontaneous radiation of undulator type due to the constructive interference
of the photons emitted from similar parts of the trajectory. As demonstrated in
Refs. 6,7, the number of oscillations can vary in a wide range from a few up to a
few thousands per cm depending on the the beam energy, the AW amplitude and
wavelength the type of the crystal and the crystallographic plane. In addition to
the spontaneous photon emission by the undulator, the scheme presented in Fig.
1 leads to a possibility to generate stimulated emission. This is due to the fact,
that photons, emitted at the points of the maximum curvature of the trajectory,
travel almost parallel to the beam and, thus, stimulate the photon generation in
the vicinity of all successive maxima and minima of the trajectory.

As demonstrated in Refs. 6,7, the AIR can be well separated from the ordinary
channeling radiation, if certain conditions on the amplitude and the length of the
acoustic wave are fulﬁlled. One of the criteria formulated in Refs. 6,7 for the stable

work of the AIR type of undulator is the small energy loss of the beam of particles
penetrating through the crystal.

In this paper we describe general formalism for the calculation of the total
radiative energy loss accounting for the contributions of both radiation mechanisms.
We perform such a calculation for the ﬁrst time. We analyze the relative importance
of the two mechanisms at various amplitudes and lengths of the acoustic wave and
the energy of the projectile particle. We establish the ranges of the projectile particle
energy, in which total radiative energy loss is negligible for the LiH, C, Si, Ge, Fe
and W crystals. This result is important for the determination of the projectile
particle energy region, in which acoustically induced radiation is of the undulator
type and also the stimulated photon emission can be eﬀectively generated.

An adequate approach to the problem of the radiation emission by an ultra-
relativistic particle moving in an external ﬁeld was developed by Baier and Katkov
and was called by the authors the “operator quasi-classical method”. The details
of that formalism can be found in Ref. 5. We use this formalism to tackle our
problem.

For convenience below we enlist the notations used throughout the paper.

For the undulator motion (i.e. the motion along the centerline of the acoustically

result ξu = 2πau/λu. Analogously, the parameter ξc may be written as ξc =
d/2
2πac/λc, where ac is the amplitude (mean) of the channeling oscillations ac ≤

Instead of evaluating the remaining integrals in (22) in the general case we will
consider the harmonic approximation for the interplanar potential.
It allows to
carry out all the calculations explicitly. The ﬁnal result can be generalized to the
case of an arbitrary interplanar potential.

To clarify the meaning of χ let us for a moment “switch oﬀ” the channeling

motion by putting ξc = 0. Then (omitting the factor √2) χ
¯hγ2puΩu/ε. Here the quantity ¯hγ2puΩu is the frequency of the radiated inten-
sity maximum, ωmax (in the case pu > 1)5. For ω
ωmax the intensity dE/dω
exponentially decreases. If χ < 1 then the intensity reaches its maximum in the
“physical” domain, i.e. ¯hωmax < ε. The opposite case χ > 1 (and, consequently
¯hωmax > ε) corresponds to the situation when a projectile can emit photons of all
frequencies lying within the range ¯hω = [0, ε] so that the spectrum intensity never
reaches the maximum. In this case the radiative energy losses are dominated by
the radiation of highly energetic photons, ¯hω

≫

≈

ε.

The analogous arguments can be provided to analyze the case of the channeling

∼

radiation only, i.e. ξu = 0.

∝

Hence, the formula (45) is a generalization of the deﬁnition of χ to the case
when both motions, the undulator and the channeling ones, exist. This expression
does not contain the cross-term
ξu ξc which could have been originated from
the interference of the photons emitted due to two diﬀerent types of motion. The
absence of the cross-term simply reﬂects the fact that, generally, the frequencies
of Ωu and Ωc (and, correspondingly, the frequencies of all possible harmonics) are
incompatible and, thus, the corresponding electromagnetic waves do not interfere.
The expression (44) can be re-written in the form which is frequently used in
the theory of energy losses due to the synchrotron and/or undulator radiation5,10.
To do this let us introduce the energy losses calculated in the classical limit. This
limit corresponds to ¯hω/ε

For a projectile positron (which is, actually, of a prime interest) it is convenient
to denote the coeﬃcients in (48) in another form by making use of the relations

From (48) (or (49)) and (50)–(51) it is clear that the magnitude of the energy
losses for a given projectile energy and a crystal length depends solely on the value
of the quantity χ, see (45). Thus, to compare the relative contributions of the two

realistic approach must take into account, ﬁrstly, the eﬀect of the decrease in the
beam volume density with the penetration distance, i.e. the dechanneling eﬀect,
and, secondly, the distribution of the beam particles in ac.

3.4.1. Account for the dechanneling eﬀect.

Random scattering of the channeling particle by the electrons and nuclei of
the crystal leads to a gradual increase of the particle energy associated with the
transverse oscillations in the channel. As a result, the transverse energy at some
distance from the entrance point exceeds the depth of the interplanar potential
well, and the particle leaves the channel. This distance is called the dechanneling
length Ld(γ, R). For a given crystal and channel it depends on a positron energy
(relativistic factor) and on the curvature radius R

Therefore, for realistic estimations it is suﬃcient to assume that the crystal
length L does not exceed Ld(γ, R) and one may calculate the relative energy loss
for L = Ld(γ, R).

It can be demonstrated11 that for a crystal bent with a constant curvature radius

R the dechanneling length Ld(γ, R) satisﬁes the relation

the bunch which are trapped into the channeling mode of motion, it is meaningful
to carry out the averaging of ∆ E/ε over the ac values satisfying (57). Thus, the

For higher values of γ the increase of ∆ E/ε will result in the shift ∆ω(K)
greater than the half-width Γ(K)

but rather the one with varying amplitude and period analogously to how it was

4. Conclusions.

In this work we have described the general formalism for the calculation of
the total radiative energy loss accounting for the contributions of both radiation
mechanisms, i.e. the acoustically induced radiation6,7 and the ordinary channeling
radiation. Our formalism is based on the quasi-classical approach (see e.g. Ref.
5). We have analyzed the relative importance of ordinary channeling radiation and
the AIR to the total radiation energy loss at various amplitudes and lengths of
the acoustic wave and as a function of the energy of the projectile particle. We
established the ranges of the projectile particle energy, in which the total radiative
energy loss is negligible for the LiH, C, Si, Ge, Fe and W crystals. This result is
important for the determination of the projectile particle energy region, in which
acoustically induced radiation of the undulator type and also the stimulated photon
emission can be eﬀectively generated.

We consider our present research as a milestone for the advanced theoretical
description of the AIR phenomenon. The goal of further investigation in this ﬁeld
is to achieve an accurate quantitative description of the undulator radiation and of
the corresponding laser eﬀect. In our recent work7 we have outlined the phenomena,
which must be thoroughly considered.

Here we mention only the problem, which is closely connected to the present
research. Using the formalism very similar to the one described here, it is interesting
to calculate the total frequency and angular distribution of of photons emitted due
to the mechanisms of the ordinary channeling radiation and the AIR. This work is
in progress at the moment and will become the subject of another publication in
the near future.

5. Particle’s motion in an acoustically bent channel

Appendix A

5.1. Approximations

In this section we outline the approximations which have been used when con-
sidering both the motion and the radiation of an ultra-relativistic charged particle
undergoing planar channeling in a crystal bent by means of a transverse, harmonic,
plane acoustic wave transmitted along the z-direction which coincides with a crys-
tallographic direction in the initially linear crystal. It is assumed that the crystal-
lographic planes are equally spaced and being parallel to the (xy)-plane.

−

velocity components, vyo, vzo. It is assumed that vyo ≪

The ultra-relativistic particle enters the crystal at z = 0 having only the y
vzo and vzo ≈

−
and z
c.
If one neglects random scattering of the particle by the electrons and nuclei of the
crystal, then the particle’s trajectory lies in the (xy)-plane and is subject to the
joint action of the interplanar force U ′(ρ) and of the centrifugal force due to the
crystal bending.

The necessary (but not suﬃcient) condition for a projectile to be trapped into
the channeling mode of motion in a bent crystal is Θ < Θc, where Θ is the entrance
angle between the particle’s velocity and the channel centerline, and Θc is some
critical angle (the estimates of Θc in the case of bent channel can be found in Ref.
11). In a linear crystal Θc coincides with the Lindhard’s angle15.

The strong inequality Θ

Θc allows to introduce the continuum approximation
for the interaction potential U between the charged projectile and lattice atoms
arranged in atomic planes. In our paper this approximation is used to describe the
equations of motion for the particle in a bent channel.

≪

5.1.1. Approximations related to the crystal bending

The shape of a channel centerline in an acoustically bent crystal is described by

y(z) = au sin kuz,

(A.1)

with ku = 2π/λu.

and wavelength are

It was demonstrated in Ref. 7 that the realistic ranges for the AW amplitude

au = 10−8 . . . 10−6 cm,

λu = 10−3 . . . 10−1 cm.

(A.2)

Therefore, we introduce an approximation by assuming that the following strong
inequality is fulﬁlled:

ξu = 2π

au
λu ≪

1.

(A.3)

All the ﬁnal formulae written below take into account the contributions of the terms
proportional to ξ0
u, while the terms the order ξ2
u and higher are omitted
(except for the cases when the ξ2

u terms are the leading ones).

u and ξ1

24 A.V.Korol, A.V.Solov’yov and W.Greiner

It is easily veriﬁed that the length of a centerline and the interplanar spacing in

linear (L, d) and in acoustically bent (L′, d′) channels are related as follows

L′ = L (1 + O(ξ2

u)),

d′ = d (1 + O(ξ2

u)).

(A.4)

The analogous relationship one ﬁnds for the distance ρ between some inner point
(y, z) of the bent channel and its centerline (see Fig. A.1):

Therefore, when neglecting the terms of the order ξ2
d′ = d, and disregard the diﬀerence between ρ and y

u and higher one may put L′ = L,

Eqs.

(A.4)–(A.5) allow us to introduce the constant ﬁeld approximation for
the interplanar potential5 which assumes that: (1) within any bent channel the
potential U depends only on the variable ρ which is the distance of the (y, z) point
from the channel centerline, (2) the explicit dependence of U on ρ in the acoustically
bent channel is identical to the U (ρ) dependence in the linear channel.

may be disregarded. Hence, the magnitude of U in the linear channel in the point
(y, z) corresponds to the the magnitude of the potential in the bent channel cal-
culated at the point (y + au sin(kuz), z). The dependence of U on y and z in an
acoustically bent channel is given by

U (y, z) = U (˜y),

˜y = y

au sin(kuz)

The constant ﬁeld approximation means that the explicit dependence U (˜y) in the
bent channel is equivalent to the dependence U (y) in a linear one. The coordinate
ρ, in the bent channel up to the terms

ξu, is equivalent to ˜y.

5.1.2. Approximations related to the energy of a projectile

We assume that for an ultra-relativistic particle, which enters the crystal having
the energy ε0 = m c2 γ0 (here the index “0′′ indicates that the quantity is measured
at the entrance) the following condition is valid while it channels in the crystal

q e Uo

1.

ε0 ≪

(A.7)

Here the quantity Uo stands for the depth of the interplanar potential well. For a
10 . . . 100 eV, so that (A.7) is well
positron (q = 1) typical values for q e Uo are
fulﬁlled in the ultra-relativistic case.

∼

The strong inequality (A.7) justiﬁes the classical description of the particle’s

motion in both linear and bent crystals.

5.2. The equations of motion

The Hamiltonian function of a relativistic particle moving in a scalar potential

U is given by

H =

(c p)2 + m2c4 + q e U (˜y),

(A.8)

where p = mγv is the momentum, and the coordinate ˜y is deﬁned in (A.6).

p

This Hamiltonian does not depend on time. Therefore, the total energy of
the particle, mγc2 + qeU is conserved. Hence, the relativistic factor satisﬁes the
condition γ = γ0 (1
qeU/ε0). If one neglects the term q e U/ε0 then the relativistic

For an arbitrary function U (˜y) the system (A.10)–(A.15) can be easily integrated

numerically by setting the initial conditions ˜y(0), ˙˜y(0), ∆z(0).

The function ˜y(t) describes the motion of the particle with respect to the cen-
terline (A.1) of the acoustically bent channel. According to (A.6), the total y(t)
dependence is obtained by combining ˜y(t) and the term au sin(kuct).

5.3. As a speciﬁc case: harmonic approximation for the interplanar
potential

The case of the harmonic interplanar potential is of a particular interest because
it allows an analytical solution of the equations of motion. Substituting the function
(30) into the right-hand side of (A.10) one gets the well-known equation for a driven
pendulum. Its solution ˜y(t) reads

The following conditions must be fulﬁlled.

(1)

cillations due to the action of the interplanar potential must not exceed the
half-width of the channel.

It is equivalent to the Lindhard’s condition which established the maximal
entrance angle of the particle with respect to the midplane in a linear channel,
Θ < ΘL = (2qeUo/ε)1/2, where ΘL is the Lindhard’s critical angle15.
This relation reﬂects the fact that in a linear channel the energy εy associated
with the transverse motion is less than the potential barrier Uo. It is easy to
verify that in the case of a harmonic potential this condition is equivalent to
ac|

< d/2.

(2) The condition for the channeling in a bent channel. Driven oscillations (the

Channeling in an acoustically bent crystal can occur only if this ration is
less than 1. For a channel bent with a constant radius such a condition was
formulated by Tsyganov13.

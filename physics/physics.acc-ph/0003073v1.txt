A free electron can temporarily gain a very signiﬁcant
amount of energy if it is overrun by an intense electromag-
netic wave. In principle, this process would permit large en-
hancements in the center-of-mass energy of electron-electron,
electron-positron and electron-photon interactions if these
take place in the presence of an intense laser beam. Prac-
tical considerations severely limit the utility of this concept
for contemporary lasers incident on relativistic electrons. A
more accessible laboratory phenomenon is electron-positron
production via an intense laser beam incident on a gas. In-
tense electromagnetic pulses of astrophysical origin can lead
to very energetic photons via bremsstrahlung of temporarily
accelerated electrons.

The prospect of acceleration of charged particles by
intense plane electromagnetic waves has excited interest
since the suggestion by Menzel and Salisbury [1] that this
mechanism might provide an explanation for the origin
of cosmic rays. However, it has generally been recognized
that if a wave overtakes a free electron, the latter gains
energy from the wave only so long as the electron is still
in the wave, and reverts to its initial energy once the
wave has past [2–5]. There is some controversy as to the
case of a “short” pulse of radiation, for which modest
net energy transfer between a wave and electron appears
possible [6–10]. Acceleration via radiation pressure is
negligible [11].
It has been remarked that even in the
case of a “long” pulse, some of the energy transferred
from the wave to the electron can be extracted if the
electron undergoes a scattering process while still inside
the wave [3,5]. This paper is an elaboration of that idea.
We do not discuss here the observed phenomenon that
an electron ionized from an atom in a strong wave can
emerge from the wave with signiﬁcant energy [12].

We consider a plane electromagnetic wave (often called
the background wave) with dimensionless, invariant ﬁeld
strength

η =

ephAµAµi

mc2

=

eErms
mω0c

=

eErmsλ0
mc2

.

(1)

Here the wave has laboratory frequency ω0, reduced
wavelength λ0, root-mean-square electric ﬁeld Erms, and
four-vector potential Aµ; e and m are the charge and
mass of the electron, and c is the speed of light.

A practical realization of such a wave is a laser been.
Laser beams with parameter η close to one have been

used in recent plasma-physics experiments [9] and in
high-energy-physics experiments [13,14].

When such a wave overtakes a free electron, the lat-
ter undergoes transverse oscillation (quiver motion), with
relativistic velocities for η >
∼ 1 [2–5,15,16]. The v × B
force then couples the transverse oscillation to a longi-
tudinal drift in the direction of the wave. In the nonrel-
ativistic limit, this eﬀect is often said to be due to the
“ponderomotive potential” associated with the envelope
of the electromagnetic pulse [3]. The resulting temporary
energy transfer to the longitudinal motion of the electron
can in principle be arbitrarily large.

A semiclassical description of this process exists as
well. A quantum-mechanical electron inside a classical
plane wave can be described by the Volkov solutions to
the Dirac equation [17,18]. Such electrons are sometimes
described as “dressed”, and they can be characterized by
a quasimomentum

q = p + ǫk0,

where the invariant ǫ is given by

ǫ =

m2η2
2(p · k0)

,

(2)

(3)

with (p· k0) being the 4-vector product of the 4-momenta
p of the electron and k0 of a photon of the background
wave. The factor ǫ need not be an integer, and can
be thought of as an eﬀective number of wave photons
“dragged” along with the electron as a result of a small
diﬀerence between the large rates of absorption and emis-
sion (back into the wave) of wave photons by the electron.
(Strictly speaking, the wave used in the Volkov solution
is classical and, hence, contains no photons.) As a result,
the electron inside the wave has an eﬀective mass, m,
that is greater than its free mass m [3]:

m2 = q2 = m2(1 + η2).

(4)

From a classical view, the quasimomentum q is the
result of averaging over the transverse oscillations (quiver
motion) of the electron in the background wave. When
discussing conservation of energy and momentum in the
classical view, both transverse and longitudinal motion
of the electron must be considered; but in a quantum
analysis, quasimomentum is conserved and no mention
is made of the classical transverse oscillations.

Throughout this paper the background wave propa-
gates in the +z direction, and the 4-momentum of a pho-
ton of this wave is written

However, the center-of-mass (cm) energy of the e+e−
system is increased when the collision occurs inside the
background wave. The cm-energy squared is

k0 = (ω0, 0, 0, ω0).

(5)

From now on, we use units in which c and ¯h equal one.
We ﬁrst consider a relativistic electron moving along

the +z axis with 4-momentum

p = (E, 0, 0, P ) = γm(1, 0, 0, β),

(6)

where E and P are the energy and the momentum of the
electron prior to the arrival of the wave, β ≈ 1 is the
electron’s velocity and γ = 1/p1 − β2 ≫ 1. Then

where the approximation holds for a relativistic electron.
For a wave of optical frequencies (such as a laser), ǫ ≫ 1.
The quasienergy, q0, is then large:

q0 = E(1 + η2).

(9)

The electron has been accelerated from energy E outside
the wave to energy E(1 + η2) inside the wave. Since η
can in principle be large compared to 1, this acceleration
can be very signiﬁcant.

Can we take advantage of this acceleration in a high-
energy-physics experiment? The example of Compton
scattering of an electron by one laser beam while in a
second laser beam has recently been reported elsewhere
[19]. Here, we consider examples of possibly enhanced
production of electroweak gauge bosons in high-energy
ee and eγ collisions in the presence of an intense laser.

Suppose the electron p collides head-on with a positron
p′, all inside the background wave. The positron 4-
momentum is then

p′ = (E ′, 0, 0,−P ′),

where E ′ ≫ m in the relativistic case. Then

(p′ · k0) = ω0(E ′ + P ′) ≈ 2E ′ω0.

The corresponding quasimomentum is

where

q′ = p′ + ǫ′k0,

ǫ′ =

m2η2

2(p′ · k0) ≈

m2η2
2E ′ω0

.

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

The factor ǫ′ is not large in general, and the energy of
a relativistic positron (or electron) moving against an
optical wave is almost unchanged.

2

s = (q + q′)2 ≈ 4EE ′(1 + η2),

(14)

which is enhanced by a factor 1 + η2 compared to the
case of no background wave.

For example, the Z 0 boson could be produced in e+e−
collisions with 33- rather than 46.6-GeV beams, if the
collision took place inside a background wave of strength
η = 1.

Of course, the background wave Compton scatters oﬀ
the positron beam at a high rate if η >
∼ 1, which results
in substantial smearing of the energy of that beam. In
practice, the cm-energy enhancement by a background
wave would not be very useful in e+e− or ee collisions.

Note, however, that Compton scattering is insigniﬁ-
cant when the background wave and electron move in the
same direction, unless the wave is extraordinarily strong.
By an application of the Larmor formula in the (average)
rest frame of the electron, we ﬁnd that the fraction of the
electron’s (laboratory) energy radiated in one cycle of its
motion in the wave is of order αη2(ω0/E), where α is the
ﬁne-structure constant.

Suppose instead that the electron collides head-on with

a high-energy photon of frequency ω and 4-momentum

p′ = k = (ω, 0, 0,−ω).

(15)

Then eq. (14) holds on substituting ω for E ′; the cm-
energy squared is again enhanced by the factor 1 + η2.

The background wave can, of course, interact directly
with the high-energy photon to produce e+e− pairs, but
if 4ωω0 < m2(1 + η2), the pair-production rate is much
suppressed [14]. Thus, there is a regime in which e +
photon collisions in a strong background wave are cleaner
than e+e− or ee collisions in the wave.

In practice, we could get the high-energy photon from
Compton scattering of the background wave oﬀ an elec-
tron beam. One might not want to backscatter the
wave oﬀ a positron beam because of “backgrounds” from
e+e− → Z 0.

A physics topic of interest would be the reaction

k + e− → W − + ν,

(16)

which proceeds via the triple-gauge-boson coupling
γW W , and whose angular distribution is sensitive to the
magnetic moment of the W boson [20,21]. The “back-
ground” process

k + e− → Z 0 + e−

(17)

could be suppressed by suitable choice of polarization of
the electron and background wave.

For electron beams of 46.6 GeV as at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, green laser light backscatters
into photons of energies up to about 30 GeV. Thus if the

laser had η = 1, the cm energy would extend up to 106
GeV, well above the threshold for reactions (16-17).

However, the enhancement factors 1+η2 in the electron
energy, eq. (9), and in the cm-energy squared, eq. (14), of
ee or electron-photon collisions are very much dependent
on the idealization that the background wave is highly
collinear with the electron.

We reconsider the preceding, but now suppose that
the electron makes angle θ ≪ 1 to the z axis, The 4-
momentum of the electron is

p = (E, P sin θ, 0, P cos θ),

(18)

and

(p · k0) = Eω0(1 − β cos θ) ≈

mω0
2γ

(1 + γ2θ2).

(19)

As a consequence, the (quasi)energy of the electron inside
the wave is now

q0 = p0 +

m2η2ω0

2(p · k0) ≈ E(cid:18)1 +

η2

1 + γ2θ2(cid:19) ,

(20)

which reduces to eq. (9) as θ goes to zero. However, if
θ > η/γ, then the electron is hardly accelerated by the
background wave.

Electrons of present interest in high-energy physics
typically have energies in the range 1-1000 GeV, corre-
sponding to γ ≈ 103-106. This places very severe require-
ments on the alignment of the background wave with the
electron beam. Indeed, the angular divergence of an elec-
tron beam is often larger than 1/γ, so that no alignment
of the background wave could impart large energy en-
hancements to the entire beam.

Furthermore, optical waves with η ≈ 1 can only be
obtained at present in focused laser beams for which the
characteristic angular spread is ∆θ >
∼ 0.1. So even if the
central angle of the beam could be aligned to better than
1/γ, only a very small fraction of the beam power would
lie within a cone of that angle.

We also note that for the quasimomentum q to be
meaningful, the electron must have resided inside the
strong background ﬁeld for at least one cycle. A rela-
tivistic electron moves distance 2γ2(1 + η2)λ0 while the
background wave advances one wavelength relative to the
electron [22]. However, the strong-ﬁeld region of a fo-
cused laser is characterized by its Rayleigh range, which
is typically a few hundred wavelengths when η ≈ 1. Fur-
ther, the transverse extent of the (classical) trajectory
is of order γηλ0. Hence, in present laser systems, the
strong-ﬁeld region is not extensive enough that the en-
ergy transfer (9) could be realized for γ >

While physical consequences of the temporary acceler-
ation of relativistic electrons inside an intense laser beam
may be diﬃcult to demonstrate, there is also interest in
the case where the electron is initially at rest, or nearly
so, such as electrons ionized from gas atoms by the pas-
sage of the background laser pulse [12].

∼ 10.

An interesting process is so-called trident production,

e + A → e′ + A′ + e+e−,

(21)

of an electron-positron pair in the interaction of an ion-
ization electron with a nucleus A of a gas atom. For a
very heavy nucleus A, its ﬁnal state A′ has a diﬀerent mo-
mentum but the same energy. Then the initial electron
must provide the energy to create the e+e− pair as well
as that for the ﬁnal electron. The least energy required is
when all three ﬁnal-state electrons and positrons are at
“rest” (i.e., they have zero net longitudinal momentum;
they must always have quiver motion when they are in
the wave). Thus, the minimum total quasienergy of the
ﬁnal-state electrons and positrons is 3m.

We conclude that the quasienergy q0 of the initial elec-

tron must be at least 3m for reaction (21) to occur.

If the electron is at rest prior to the arrival of the back-

ground wave its 4-momentum is

p = (m, 0, 0, 0).

(22)

As the electron is overtaken by a wave of strength η and
4-momentum given by (5), it takes on quasimomentum

q = (m(1 + η2/2), 0, 0, mη2/2) ≡ (mγ, 0, 0, mγβz). (23)
Thus, the net longitudinal velocity of the electron inside
the wave is βz = qz/q0 = (η2/2)/(1 + η2/2). As ex-
pected, inside a very strong wave the electron can take
on relativistic longitudinal motion.

We could have trident production while the electron
is still in the wave if the quasienergy q0 = m(1 + η2/2)
exceeds 3m. For an electron initially at rest, this requires

η ≥ p16 + 12√2 = 5.74.
The trident process is still possible within a wave with
η < 5.74 provided the electron has quasienergy q0 ≥ 3m.
This might arise, for example, because of acceleration of
the electron by the plasma-wakeﬁeld eﬀect [23].

It is conceivable that the electron creates the pair in
a linearly polarized wave at a phase when its (classical)
kinetic energy is high, but the ﬁnal electron and the pair
all appear with a lower kinetic energy corresponding to
some other phase of the wave. This can’t happen if the
interaction takes place at a well-deﬁned point, since the
phase of the wave is a unique function space and time.
It might occur if the ﬁnal particles “tunnel” to another
space-time point before appearing, and the instantaneous
kinetic energy is lower at that point.

However, we will ﬁnd shortly that such tunneling is not
consistent with energy conservation. To be as deﬁnite as
possible, we consider ordinary energy along the classical
trajectories, rather than quasimomentum. The latter is
taken into account in the sense that the electron and
positron are not created at rest, but with the transverse
velocities appropriate to phase of the background wave
at the spacetime point at which the pair appears.
It
is suﬃcient to consider only those trajectories with zero
average momentum (i.e., zero quasi-3-momentum).

For circular polarization of the background wave, the
electron trajectory is a circle in the plane perpendicu-
lar to the z axis, with radius a/ω0, velocity β = a and
Lorentz factor

γcirc =

1

√1 − a2

= p1 + η2,

where parameter a is given by

a2 =

η2

1 + η2 ,

0 ≤ a2 ≤ 1.

(24)

(25)

For a background wave that is linearly polarized in the
x-direction, the trajectory can be parametrized as [4,15]

x = √2

a
ω0

sin δ,

z =

a2
4ω0

sin 2δ,

(26)

where δ = ω0τp1 + η2 = ω0τ /√1 − a2, and τ is the

proper time. Expression (26) describes the well-known
ﬁgure-8 trajectory. Now dx/dτ = (dx/dt)(dt/dτ ) = γβx,
so γ2 = 1 + γ2β2 = 1 + (dx/dτ )2 + (dz/dτ )2. We ﬁnd
that

γlin =

1 + 1

2 [a2 − (ω0x)2]
√1 − a2

.

(27)

From expression (26) for the x-trajectory we see that
0 ≤ (ω0x)2 ≤ 2a2, so

γmin =

,

and

γmax =

1 + η2/2

p1 + η2

1 + 3η2/2

p1 + η2

. (28)

These values surround the result that γcirc = p1 + η2
always for circular polarization. For small η, γmin ≈ 1 +
η4/8, γmax ≈ 1 + η2, and γcirc ≈ 1 + η2/2; for large η,
γmin ≈ η/2, γmax ≈ 3η/2, and γcirc ≈ η.
Suppose an electron interacts with a nucleus at the
place where its Lorentz factor is γmax and reappears along
with an electron-positron pair at a location where γmin
holds at that moment. The nucleus absorbs the excess
momentum of the initial electron. Conservation of (ordi-
nary) energy requires that γmax = 3γmin. But this is not
satisﬁed for any value of η according to (28). That is,
the hypothetical tunneling process is not possible under
any circumstances.

In sum, even when in a background wave an electron
can produce positrons oﬀ nuclei only if the electron has
suﬃcient longitudinal momentum that the corresponding
(quasi)energy is three times the (eﬀective) electron mass.
We close by returning to the astrophysical context
that began the historical debate on acceleration by in-
tense electromagnetic waves. Gunn and Ostriker [24]
have given an extensive discussion the possibility of elec-
tron acceleration in the rotating dipole ﬁeld of a millisec-
ond pulsar, where the ﬁeld strength η can be of order
1010. Their argument does not primarily address free
electrons overtaken by a wave, but rather electrons “in-
jected” or “dropped at rest’ into the wave. Neutron decay

4

is a candidate process for injection. In very strong ﬁelds
(η ≫ 1) this decay takes place together with the absorp-
tion by the electron (and proton) of a very large num-
ber of wave photons, so that the electron is created with
(quasi)energy ≈ mη2/2 (compare eq. (23)) [25]. Because
the ﬁelds of the pulsar fall oﬀ as 1/r where (coinciden-
tally) rpulsar ≈ λ0, the wavelength of the rotating dipole
radiation, the ﬁeld region is “short”, and the electron
may emerge with some fraction of the large energy it had
at the moment of its creation.

An example closer to the theme of the present paper
would be an electron that is overtaken by the intense
electromagnetic pulse of a supernova (or other transient
astrophysical occurrence, perhaps including gamma-ray
bursters), and thereby temporarily accelerated to en-
ergy mη2/2. Such pulses could have signiﬁcant ﬁelds
at optical frequencies, where the transverse scale, ηλ0,
of the motion of accelerated electrons is less than the
Chandrasekhar radius for η < 1010.
In general, the
electron has low energy before and after the passage of
the pulse. However, high-energy photons can arise via
bremsstrahlung of the electron when it interacts with a
plasma nucleus while still in the pulse.
In this view,
the primary astrophysical evidence of temporarily accel-
erated electrons would be high-energy photons which, of
course, could transfer some of their energy to protons and
other charged particles in subsequent interactions.

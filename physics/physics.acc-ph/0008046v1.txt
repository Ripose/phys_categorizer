NONLINEAR BEAM DYNAMICS AND EFFECTS OF WIGGLERS

A. Fedorova, M. Zeitlin, IPME, RAS, V.O. Bolshoj pr., 61,199178, St. Petersburg, Russia∗ †

Abstract

We present the applications of variational–wavelet ap-
proach for the analytical/numerical treatment of the effects
of insertion devices on beam dynamics. We investigate the
dynamical models which have polynomial nonlinearities
and variable coefﬁcients. We construct the corresponding
wavelet representation for wigglers and undulator magnets.

1

INTRODUCTION

In this paper we consider the applications of a new nume-
rical-analytical technique which is based on the methods
of local nonlinear harmonic analysis or wavelet analysis to
the treatment of effects of insertion devices on beam dy-
namics. Our approach in this paper is based on the general-
ization of variational-wavelet approach from [1]-[8], which
allows us to consider not only polynomial but rational type
of nonlinearities [9]. We present solution via full multires-
olution expansion in all time scales, which gives us expan-
sion into a slow part and fast oscillating parts. So, we may
move from coarse scales of resolution to the ﬁnest one for
obtaining more detailed information about our dynamical
process. In this way we give contribution to our full solu-
tion from each scale of resolution or each time scale. The
same is correct for the contribution to power spectral den-
sity (energy spectrum): we can take into account contri-
butions from each level/scale of resolution. Starting from
formulation of initial dynamical problems (part 2) we con-
struct in part 3 via multiresolution analysis explicit repre-
sentation for all dynamical variables in the base of com-
pactly supported wavelets. Then in part 4 we consider fur-
ther extension of our previous results to the case of variable
coefﬁcients.

2 EFFECTS OF INSERTION DEVICES

ON BEAM DYNAMICS

Assuming a sinusoidal ﬁeld variation, we may consider ac-
cording to [10] the analytical treatment of the effects of
insertion devices on beam dynamics. One of the major
detrimental aspects of the installation of insertion devices
is the resulting reduction of dynamic aperture. Introduction
of non-linearities leads to enhancement of the amplitude-
dependent tune shifts and distortion of phase space. The
nonlinear ﬁelds will produce signiﬁcant effects at large be-
tatron amplitudes such as excitation of n–order resonances.

y = k2 = (2π/λ)2, where λ is the period length

the ﬁeld B0. After a canonical transformation to betatron
variables, the Hamiltonian is averaged over the period of
the insertion device and hyperbolic functions are expanded
to the fourth order in x and y (or arbitrary order). Then we
have the following Hamiltonian:

3 WAVELET FRAMEWORK

The ﬁrst main part of our consideration is some varia-
tional approach to this problem, which reduces initial prob-
lem to the problem of solution of functional equations at
the ﬁrst stage and some algebraical problems at the sec-
ond stage. Multiresolution expansion is the second main
part of our construction. Because afﬁne group of trans-
lation and dilations is inside the approach, this method
resembles the action of a microscope. We have contri-
bution to ﬁnal result from each scale of resolution from
the whole inﬁnite scale of increasing closed subspaces Vj:
...V−2 ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ .... The solution
is parameterized by solutions of two reduced algebraical
problems, one is nonlinear and the second are some linear
problems, which are obtained by the method of Connec-
tion Coefﬁcients (CC)[11]. We use compactly supported
wavelet basis. Let our wavelet expansion be

f (x) = Xℓ∈Z

cℓϕℓ(x) +

∞

Xj=0 Xk∈Z

cjkψjk(x)

(4)

If cjk = 0 for j ≥ J, then f (x) has an alternative ex-
pansion in terms of dilated scaling functions only f (x) =
cJℓϕJℓ(x). This is a ﬁnite wavelet expansion, it can
Pℓ∈Z

be written solely in terms of translated scaling functions.
To solve our second associated linear problem we need
to evaluate derivatives of f (x) in terms of ϕ(x). Let be
ℓ = dnϕℓ(x)/dxn. We consider computation of the
ϕn
wavelet - Galerkin integrals. Let f d(x) be d-derivative of
ℓ (x), and
function f (x), then we have f d(x) = Pℓ clϕd
ℓ (x) can be expanded in terms of ϕ(x)

where λm are wavelet-Galerkin integrals. The coefﬁcients
λm are 2-term connection coefﬁcients. In general we need
to ﬁnd (di ≥ 0)

we obtain the coefﬁcients of reduced nonlinear algebraical
system and after that we obtain the coefﬁcients of wavelet
expansion (4). As a result we obtained the explicit time so-
lution of our problem in the base of compactly supported
wavelets. On Fig.1 we present an example of basis wavelet
function which satisﬁes some boundary conditions. In the
following we consider extension of this approach to the
case of arbitrary variable coefﬁcients.

4 VARIABLE COEFFICIENTS

In the case when we have the situation when our problems
(2),(3) are described by a system of nonlinear (rational) dif-
ferential equations, we need to consider also the extension
of our previous approach which can take into account any
type of variable coefﬁcients (periodic, regular or singular).
We can produce such approach if we add in our construc-
tion additional reﬁnement equation, which encoded all in-
formation about variable coefﬁcients [12]. According to
our variational approach we need to compute only addi-
tional integrals of the form

Λd1d2...dn

Y ϕdi

ℓi (x)dx

(6)

ZD

bij(t)(ϕ1)d1 (2mt − k1)(ϕ2)d2 (2mt − k2)dx,

(10)

For Riccati case we need to evaluate two and three connec-
tion coefﬁcients

where bij(t) are arbitrary functions of time and trial func-
tions ϕ1, ϕ2 satisfy the reﬁnement equations:

ϕd1 (x)ϕd2

Λd1d2d3 =

ℓ (x)ϕd3

m (x)dx

−∞

According to CC method [11] we use the next construc-
tion. When N in scaling equation is a ﬁnite even positive
integer the function ϕ(x) has compact support contained in
[0, N − 1]. For a ﬁxed triple (d1, d2, d3) only some Λd1d2d3
are nonzero: 2 − N ≤ ℓ ≤ N − 2,
2 − N ≤ m ≤
|ℓ − m| ≤ N − 2. There are M = 3N 2 − 9N + 7
N − 2,
such pairs (ℓ, m). Let Λd1d2d3 be an M-vector, whose com-
ponents are numbers Λd1d2d3
. Then we have the ﬁrst re-
duced algebraical system : Λ satisfy the system of equa-
tions (d = d1 + d2 + d3)

AΛd1d2d3 = 21−dΛd1d2d3,
Aℓ,m;q,r = Xp

(8)

By moment equations we have created a system of M +d+
1 equations in M unknowns. It has rank M and we can ob-
tain unique solution by combination of LU decomposition
and QR algorithm. The second reduced algebraical system
gives us the 2-term connection coefﬁcients (d = d1 + d2):
AΛd1d2 = 21−dΛd1d2, Aℓ,q = Xp

apaq−2ℓ+p

(9)

For nonquadratic case we have analogously additional lin-
ear problems for objects (6). Solving these linear problems

If we consider all computations in the class of compactly
supported wavelets then only a ﬁnite number of coefﬁcients
do not vanish. To approximate the non-constant coefﬁ-
cients, we need choose a different reﬁnable function ϕ3
along with some local approximation scheme

(Bℓf )(x) := Xα∈Z

Fℓ,k(f )ϕ3(2ℓt − k),

(12)

where Fℓ,k are suitable functionals supported in a small
neighborhood of 2−ℓk and then replace bij in (10) by
Bℓbij(t). In particular case one can take a characteristic
function and can thus approximate non-smooth coefﬁcients
locally. To guarantee sufﬁcient accuracy of the resulting
approximation to (10) it is important to have the ﬂexibility
of choosing ϕ3 different from ϕ1, ϕ2. In the case when D
is some domain, we can write

bij(t) |D= X0≤k≤2ℓ

bij(t)χD(2ℓt − k),

(13)

where χD is characteristic function of D. So, if we take
ϕ4 = χD, which is again a reﬁnable function, then the
problem of computation of (10) is reduced to the problem
of calculation of integral

H(k1, k2, k3, k4) = H(k) = ZRs
1 (2rt − k3)ϕd2
ϕ3(2ℓt − k2)ϕd1

ϕ4(2jt − k1) ·

2 (2st − k4)dx (14)

The key point is that these integrals also satisfy some sort
of reﬁnement equation [12]:

2−|µ|H(k) = Xℓ∈Z

b2k−ℓH(ℓ),

µ = d1 + d2.

(15)

This equation can be interpreted as the problem of comput-
ing an eigenvector. Thus, we reduced the problem of ex-
tension of our method to the case of variable coefﬁcients to
the same standard algebraical problem as in the preceding
sections. So, the general scheme is the same one and we
have only one more additional linear algebraic problem by
which we can parameterize the solutions of corresponding
problem in the same way.

On Fig. 2 we present approximated conﬁguration and on
Fig. 3 the corresponding multiresolution representation ac-
cording to formula (4).

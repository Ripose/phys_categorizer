Abstract

During the 1990s an international collaboration has been studying the possibility
of constructing and operating a high-energy high-luminosity µ+µ− collider. Such a
machine could be the approach of choice to extend our discovery reach beyond that
of the LHC. More recently, a growing collaboration is exploring the potential of a
stored-muon-beam “neutrino factory” to elucidate neutrino oscillations. A neutrino
factory could be an attractive stepping-stone to a muon collider. Its construction,
possibly feasible within the coming decade, could have substantial impact on neu-
trino physics.

1 Introduction

The Neutrino Factory and Muon Collider Collaboration (NFMCC) [1] is en-
gaged in an international R&D project to establish the feasibility of a high-
energy µ+µ− collider and a stored-muon-beam “neutrino factory.” As a heavy
lepton, the muon oﬀers important advantages over the electron for use in a
high-energy collider:

erators. This reduces the size and cost of the complex. It also allows use

of a storage ring, increasing luminosity by a factor
collider.

ton increases the cross section for s-channel Higgs production by a factor
104, opening a unique avenue for studying the dynam-
mµ
ics of electroweak symmetry breaking [2]. More generally, a sensitivity
advantage may be expected in any model that seeks to explain mass
generation [3].

(3) Beam-beam interactions make high luminosity harder to achieve as the
energy of an e+e− linear collider is increased, an eﬀect that is negligible
for muon colliders [4].

The small size anticipated for a muon collider is indicated in Fig. 1, which
compares various proposed future accelerators. Unlike other proposals, muon
colliders up to √s = 3 TeV ﬁt comfortably on existing Laboratory sites. Be-
yond this energy neutrino-induced radiation (produced by neutrino interac-
tions in surface rock), which increases as E3, starts to become a signiﬁcant
hazard, and new ideas or sites where the neutrinos break ground in unin-
habited areas would be required. A muon collider facility can provide many
ancillary beneﬁts (physics “spinoﬀs”) and can be staged to provide interesting
physics opportunities even before a high-energy collider is completed. These
include experiments [5] with intense meson and muon beams produced using
1022 protons/year) proton source, as well as neutrino
the high-ﬂux (
beams of unprecedented intensity and quality, discussed below in Sec. 7.

1 year ago. While stored muon beams have been discussed since

Ref. [6] is a comprehensive summary of the status of muon collider research as
of
1960 [7],
and muon colliders since 1968 [8], only in recent years has a practical approach
to the realization of a µ+µ− collider been devised. The key concept that may
allow a muon collider to become a reality is ionization cooling [9–11]. Muons
may be copiously produced using collisions of multi-GeV protons with a target
to produce pions, which then decay in a focusing “capture channel.” However,
those muons occupy a large emittance (phase-space volume) and are unsuit-
able for injection directly into an accelerator. Muon-beam cooling is needed
to reduce the emittance by a suﬃcient factor but must be carried out in a
2 µs muon lifetime. While other beam-cooling
time short compared to the
methods are too slow, as discussed below, simulations show that ionization
cooling can meet these requirements.

2 Proton Source, Targetry, and Capture

Muon-collider luminosity estimates (see Table 1) have been made under the
assumption that a 4 MW proton beam may safely strike a target representing
2–3 hadronic interaction lengths, which is tilted at a 100–150 mr angle with
respect to the solenoidal focusing ﬁeld (see Fig. 2). Design studies are ongo-
ing to demonstrate this in detail, and BNL-E951 at the AGS will test this
experimentally within the next few years [12]. Ideas being explored include a
liquid-metal jet target (Fig. 2) and a “bandsaw” target (Fig. 3). In neutrino-
factory scenarios the beam power requirement is eased to 1 MW, making a
graphite target also a possibility. About 10% of the beam energy is dissipated
in the target. A target with comparable dissipation is being designed for the
Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory [13]. The re-
quired 4 MW proton source, while beyond existing capability, is the subject of
ongoing design studies at Brookhaven [14] and Fermilab [15] and is compara-
ble in many respects to machines proposed for spallation neutron sources [16].
For eﬃcient capture of the produced low-energy pions, the target is located
within a 20 T solenoidal magnetic ﬁeld to be produced using a superconducting
solenoid with a water-cooled copper-coil insert (Fig. 2). The captured pions
and their decay muons proceed through a solenoidal ﬁeld that decreases adia-

which must be decreased for acceptance into a cooling channel. This can be
accomplished via radio-frequency (RF) “phase rotation,” by which the energy
of the low-energy muons is raised and that of the high-energy muons lowered.
This brings a substantial fraction (
60%) of the muons into a narrow energy
range at the expense of increasing the bunch length (Fig. 4). The large trans-
verse size of the beam at this point necessitates low-frequency (30–60 MHz)
RF cavities. An alternative under investigation is use of an induction linac.
If the phase-rotation accelerating gradient is suﬃciently high (
4–5 MV/m),
a signiﬁcant portion of the pions can be phase-rotated before they decay, al-
lowing muon polarization as high as
50%. Otherwise the polarization is nat-
20% [17]. Muon polarization can be exploited in a variety of physics
urally
10−6
studies [6] as well as in a neutrino factory [18]. It can also provide a
ﬁll-to-ﬁll relative calibration of the beam energy [19] (needed e.g. to measure
the width of the Higgs).

3 Ionization Cooling

The goal of beam cooling is to reduce the normalized six-dimensional emit-
tance of the beam. The signiﬁcance of emittance for accelerator design is that
it places limits on how tightly the beam can be focused and determines the

apertures necessary to transport and accelerate it without losses. A muon
beam can be cooled by passing it alternately through material, in which ion-
ization energy loss reduces both the transverse and longitudinal momentum
components, and RF accelerating cavities, in which the lost longitudinal mo-
mentum is restored (Fig. 5). This process reduces the transverse momentum
components relative to the longitudinal one (“transverse cooling”).

Before summarizing the theory of ionization cooling we must ﬁrst deﬁne emit-
tance more carefully.

3.1 Emittance

Emittance can be deﬁned in terms of the vector of canonical variables describ-
ing each muon, which can be chosen as X = (x, y, z, px, py, pz). In the absence
of correlations among these variables, the six-dimensional volume of the beam
in phase space can be represented by σxσpxσyσpy σzσpz , where σi designates the
r.m.s. width of the distribution in the ith variable. More generally, the nor-
malized six-dimensional emittance ǫ6,n is given by √det V /(mµc)6, where V is
6 covariance matrix of X, mµ is the mass of of the muon, and c is the
the 6
speed of light. If the oﬀ-diagonal (correlation) terms of V are negligible, the
ǫx,nǫy,nǫz,n, where ǫx,n = σxσpx/mµc
emittance can be approximated as ǫ6,n ≈
and so forth, or in a cylindrically-symmetric system such as we consider be-
ǫ2
⊥nǫkn, where ǫ⊥n (ǫkn) is the normalized transverse (longitudinal)
low, ǫ6,n ≈
emittance.

×

By Liouville’s theorem, normalized emittance is conserved in linear beam
transport and acceleration. Beam cooling thus requires a “violation” of Li-
ouville’s theorem, which is possible by means of dissipative forces such as
ionization energy loss [10].

where s is the path length, Eµ the muon energy, LR the radiation length of
the absorber medium, β = v/c, and β⊥ is the betatron function of the beam
(inversely proportional to the square of the beam divergence).

In Eq. 1 we see, in addition to the dE/ds transverse cooling term, a transverse
heating term due to multiple Coulomb scattering of the muons in the absorber.
Since cooling ceases once the heating and cooling terms are equal, Eq. 1 im-
plies an equilibrium emittance, which in principle (neglecting other limiting
efects) would be reached asymptotically were the cooling channel continued
indeﬁnitely. Since the heating term is proportional to β⊥ and inversely propor-
tional to the radiation length of the absorber medium, the goal of achieving as
small an equilibrium emittance as possible requires us to locate the absorber
only in low-β⊥ regions and to use a medium with the longest possible radiation
length, namely hydrogen. To achieve low β⊥, we want the strongest possible
focusing elements. We are thus led to superconducting solenoids ﬁlled with
liquid hydrogen as possibly the optimal solution. 2

Below the ionization minimum, energy loss increases approximately as p−1.7,
while Coulomb scattering increases only as (pβ)−1 [22]. Ionization cooling
thus favors low momenta, despite the relativistic increase in muon lifetime
with momentum. In fact, Eq. 1 implies that the equilibrium emittance scales
approximately as γ1.7β0.7. Most simulations of muon cooling are now being
done at p = 187 MeV/c. Still lower momenta could in principle be better but
are diﬃcult to transport in practice due to larger beam divergences.

3.3 Cooling channel designs

In the “alternating-solenoid” cooling channel [23] the muon beam is kept fo-
cused by a series of superconducting solenoids alternating in magnetic-ﬁeld
direction (Fig. 6). As the ﬁeld alternates, its magnitude must of course pass
through zero; at these points β⊥ is necessarily large. Here solenoids with large

2 However, lithium lenses might give an even lower equilibrium emittance than
solenoids with liquid hydrogen, since stronger focusing ﬁelds may be feasible with
liquid-lithium lenses than with magnets, and this may overcome the radiation-length
advantage of hydrogen.

inner bore are suitable, allowing insertion of RF cavities. In between are re-
gions of low β⊥, corresponding to maxima of the magnetic ﬁeld, where the
liquid-hydrogen absorbers are located. (The ﬁeld directions alternate so that
canonical angular momentum [24], which builds up within each absorber as the
muon beam loses mechanical angular momentum, cancels rather than build-
ing up.) Another type of arrangement (dubbed “FoFo”) is also under study, in
which solenoid fringe-ﬁeld focusing is employed. This allows lower β⊥ values
for a given ﬁeld strength than in the alternating-solenoid arrangement. In the
FoFo channel the low-β⊥ regions (and the absorbers) are thus at low ﬁeld and
the RF cavities at high ﬁeld.

Both the FoFo and alternating-solenoid cooling channels feature liquid-
hydrogen absorbers in which a substantial amount of power is dissipated by
the muon beam. In a typical case, 1013 muons per bunch at a 15 Hz repetition
rate deposit a few hundred watts in each absorber. This is within the range
of operation of high-power liquid-hydrogen targets that have been used in the
past [25] or proposed for future experiments [26]. Careful attention must be
paid to the design of these absorbers, for reasons both of safety and of perfor-
mance. For example, the windows must be made of low-Z material and kept
as thin as possible in order not to degrade the cooling performance by causing
excessive multiple scattering. Aluminum alloy appears to be an acceptable
solution.

As an example of the performance that can be achieved in such a cooling
channel, Fig. 7 shows as a function of distance the six-dimensional and lon-
gitudinal beam emittances as well as the relative beam intensity in a sim-
ulated alternating-solenoid channel using
15 T solenoids and 805 MHz RF
cavities. These cooling-channel parameters are representative of a late stage
of cooling for a muon collider and were chosen for initial detailed studies in
order to demonstrate a solution in a technically-challenging regime. The six-
dimensional emittance is reduced by a factor of 3 in 26 m, with less than 2%
non-decay beam loss.

≈

Eq. 1 implies a natural scaling of the cooling-channel components as the beam
becomes progressively cooler: to maintain the cooling rate as equilibrium is
approached, β⊥ must be periodically decreased to establish a new, smaller,
equilibrium emittance. This means the focusing ﬁelds must become stronger.
How small a β⊥ can be achieved in an alternating-solenoid channel has not
yet been deﬁnitively determined, but 20 T seems a practical upper limit to
superconducting-solenoid ﬁeld strength [27], and perhaps 30 T in a super-
conducting/copper hybrid design. To continue transverse cooling beyond the
practical limit for the alternating-solenoid channel, liquid-lithium lenses or
FoFo-type channels may be solutions. In a scenario sketched by Palmer [28,6]
a factor 106 in six-dimensional emittance is achieved in a distance of
500 m
using a series of 25 alternating-solenoid channels followed by three lithium-lens

stages, with each stage contributing a factor of about 2. This cooling factor is
suﬃcient to permit the collider luminosities of Table 1.

3.4 Emittance exchange

As the muon beam passes through the transverse-cooling channel the longitu-
dinal emittance grows. This arises from four eﬀects:

(1) Working below the ionization minimum, there is positive feedback, since

as the muons lose momentum their energy-loss rate increases.

(2) The beam energy spread increases in the absorber due to energy-loss

straggling.

(3) The bunch tends to drift apart because slow muons take longer to traverse

the channnel than fast muons.

(4) The bunch tends to drift apart because muons at large transverse am-

plitude follow helical trajectories of greater path length than muons at
small transverse amplitude.

Eventually, signiﬁcant beam losses begin to occur (see Fig. 7) as muons drift
outside the stable RF bucket. At this point longitudinal emittance must be
exchanged for transverse emittance. Such emittance exchange may be accom-
plished by placing wedge-shaped absorbers at a point of momentum dispersion
in the beam transport lattice (Fig. 8). With high-momentum muons passing
through a greater thickness of absorber than low-energy muons, the beam
energy spread is reduced, at the expense of an increase in transverse beam
size. While solutions have been devised on paper, detailed simulations so far
have shown that a concrete realization of this idea is challenging, and work is
ongoing to ﬁnd a practical solution.

3.5 RF Development

Rapid muon cooling requires development of high-gradient RF cavities (e.g.,
36 MV/m at 805 MHz) with suitable high-power drive systems. A novel feature
of muon acceleration is the possibility of using “pillbox” cavities, closed at each
end by low-mass metal windows, to increase the uniformity of the electric ﬁeld
within the cavity and lower the power requirements. These developments are in
progress, with 805 MHz [29] and 175–200 MHz designs now under development
and planned for testing over the next few years at BNL, FNAL, and LBNL.
Alternative gridded and windowless designs are also in progress, as well as
power-source design studies.

11

3.6 Muon Cooling Experiment

While the physics underlying ionization cooling is reasonably well under-
stood, ionization cooling has yet to be demonstrated in practice. To demon-
strate feasibility and establish performance, a muon cooling experiment (MU-
COOL) [30] has been proposed to Fermilab (Fig. 9). With the increasing in-
terest in the possibility of a muon-storage-ring neutrino factory, over the last
year the activities of the NFMCC have undergone a change of emphasis, and
the focus of the proposed experiment is now turning from the late stages of
cooling to the initial stages. We now envisage a cooling test facility that will
be staged so as to demonstrate initial-stage cooling (such as will be needed
for a neutrino factory) ﬁrst, with tests of late cooling stages (needed for a
muon collider) coming later. The lower RF frequency used in early cooling
stages relaxes requirements for timing-measurement resolution, thus simpler
measurement approaches than indicated in Fig. 9 are now envisaged.

4 Acceleration

Rapid acceleration to the collider beam energy is needed to avoid excessive
decay losses. This can be accomplished in a series of linacs and “racetrack” re-
circulating linear accelerators (RLAs) such as have been developed at Jeﬀerson
Laboratory. Several scenarios have been considered. As an example [31], linacs
at 175 and 350 MHz can be employed to raise the energy of the cooled muon
beam to 2 GeV, after which it is accelerated in a ﬁrst 4-turn RLA to 8 GeV
and, in a second, to 30 GeV (a possible storage-ring energy for a neutrino fac-
tory). Other scenarios include RLAs with larger numbers of turns, “dogbone-
geometry” RLAs [32], and ﬁxed-ﬁeld alternating-gradient [33] (FFAG) accel-
erators. At suﬃciently high energy (above a few hundred GeV), the muon
lifetime becomes long enough that ramped “rapid-accelerating” synchrotrons
may be used [34].

5 Collider Scenarios

Collider scenarios have been considered at three energies, √s = 0.1, 0.4, and
3 TeV (see Table 1). Three variants of the 0.1 TeV (“Higgs Factory”) machine
have been worked out, covering a range of momentum spread. While reducing
the momentum spread also reduces the luminosity, given the narrow width
expected for the Higgs, the event rate and Higgs precision are optimized at
the narrowest momentum spread (Fig. 10) [2]. The 0.4 and 3 TeV scenarios are

beyond the reach of the LHC [34].

6 Collider Detector

A “strawman” detector has been simulated in Geant [35]. To cope with high
background rates from muon decay within the storage ring, pixel detectors are
employed near the beamline, and an extensive series of tungsten shields are
deployed around the interaction point (Fig. 11). At r = 5 cm, pixels of dimen-
150 µm2 have estimated occupancies below 1%. Pattern recognition

7 Neutrino Factory

Recently the possibility of a neutrino factory based on a muon storage ring
has received much attention [18,32,36–38]. Such a facility could help unravel
the mystery of neutrino mixing by providing neutrino beams of unprecedented
intensity, brilliance, and purity. It could also serve as a stepping-stone to a
muon collider. A neutrino factory should be easier and cheaper to construct
and operate than a muon collider since it requires less cooling and less in-
tense muon bunches. This follows straightforwardly from the fact that col-
lider luminosity, being proportional to the square of the bunch intensity and
inversely proportional to the transverse bunch size, requires as small and in-
tense a bunch as possible, while the sensitivity of neutrino experiments is

A muon collider contains various sources of intense neutrino beams, for ex-
ample muon decays within the straight sections of the muon accelerators and
collider storage ring. As mentioned above, for suﬃciently high muon energies
these “parasitic” neutrino beams may limit feasibility due to radiation-safety
concerns. Such beams could be used to advance both “conventional” neutrino
physics (structure functions, sin2 θW , etc.) and neutrino-oscillation studies.

Scale is indicated by bars extending outwards from the IP: vertical bar is 2 cm in

At high muon energies the ﬂux of neutrinos is suﬃcient for useful detection
rates on the other side of the earth. Options that have been discussed include
beams aimed from Brookhaven, CERN, Fermilab, or KEK to Soudan, SLAC,
and Gran Sasso, giving baselines ranging from 700 to 7000 km for neutrino-
oscillation searches. Other options are also conceivable, for example use of a
new detector at some suitable location.

Unlike a muon collider, in dedicated-neutrino-factory scenarios the muon stor-
age ring would be designed to maximize the fraction of muons decaying in
straight sections, leading to an oblong “racetrack” geometry. Other geome-
tries have also been considered, e.g. a triangular or “bowtie-shaped” ring that
could aim two neutrino beams simultaneously at two diﬀerent remote detec-
tors. The bowtie geometry has the virtue of preserving polarization, since it
bends equally in both directions.

tional meson-decay neutrino beams, which are dominantly νµ but with some
νe contamination, neutrino beams from a stored µ− beam are 50% νµ and 50%
¯νe, while those from µ+ are 50% ¯νµ and 50% νe. The availability of intense
high-energy electron-neutrino beams makes possible tau- and muon-neutrino
appearance experiments. The use of both muon polarities allows investigation
of matter eﬀects in neutrino oscillation. The phenomenology of three-ﬂavor
neutrino oscillation (as required if at least two of the three observed eﬀects [39–
41] are conclusively established) is quite complex [37,38]. No other proposed
facility has comparable power to pin down the details of mixing among three
neutrino ﬂavors.

8 Conclusions

The prospect of a high-luminosity µ+µ− collider, once entirely speculative, has
by dint of much work and study now been brought into the realm of possibility.
While a collider is still a question for the long term (post-2010), ideas (most
notably a neutrino factory) spun oﬀ from this eﬀort may have a substantial
impact on high-energy physics in the coming decade.

STUDIES FOR MUON COLLIDER PARAMETERS AT CENTER-OF-MASS
ENERGIES OF 10 TEV AND 100 TEV

Bruce J. King, Brookhaven National Laboratory 1

Abstract

Parameter lists are presented for speculative muon collid-
ers at center-of-mass energies of 10 TeV and 100 TeV. The
technological advances required to achieve the given pa-
rameters are itemized and discussed, and a discussion is
given of the design goals and constraints. An important
constraint for multi-TeV muon colliders is the need to min-
imize neutrino radiation from the collider ring.

1

INTRODUCTION

The main motivation for research and development efforts
on muon collider technology is the assertion that affordably
priced muon colliders might provide lepton-lepton colli-
sions at much higher center of mass (CoM) energies than is
feasible for electron colliders, and perhaps eventually ex-
plore the spectrum of elementary particles at mass scales
inaccessible even to hadron colliders.

look at

This paper attempts a ﬁrst

these assertions
through discussion and evaluation of the self-consistent
muon collider parameter sets given in table 1, at CoM ener-
gies of 10 TeV and 100 TeV. These parameter sets have the
purpose of pin-pointing the challenges of very high energy
muon colliders and they have not been studied or discussed
in detail within the Muon Collider Collaboration (MCC) or
elsewhere.

The 10 TeV parameter set was presented previously [1]
and the parameter values appear to be internally consis-
tent. In contrast, the 100 TeV parameter set represents work
in progress to improve in luminosity and other parameters
over the self-consistent 100 TeV parameter set given in ref-
erence [1] and it’s parameters are not yet fully consistent,
as discussed below.

2 GENERATION OF PARAMETER SETS

As described previously [1], the parameter sets in table
1 were generated through iterative runs of a stand-alone
FORTRAN program, LUMCALC. The parameter sets are
calculated from the input values for several input parame-
ters – namely, the CoM energy (ECoM), the collider ring
circumference (C) and depth below the Earth’s surface (D),
the beam momentum spread (δ) and 6-dimensional invari-
ant emittance (ǫ6N), the reference pole-tip magnetic ﬁeld
for the ﬁnal focus quadrupoles (B4σ), and the time until the
beams are dumped (tD) – and from the input of maximum
allowable values for several other parameters – namely,
the bunch repetition frequency (fb), the initial number of

muons per bunch (N0), the beam-beam tune disruption pa-
rameter (∆ν), the beam divergence at the interaction point
(σθ), the maximum aperture for the ﬁnal focus quadrupoles
(A±4σ), and maximum allowable neutrino radiation where
the plane of the collider ring cuts the Earth’s surface.

As a preliminary stage of calculation, LUMCALC
makes any parameter adjustments that may be required to
satisfy the input constraints. These are, in order: 1) reduc-
ing σθ to the limit imposed by A±4σ (based on scaling to
existing ﬁnal focus designs at 0.1 TeV and 4 TeV[1]), 2)
reducing N0 to attain an acceptable ∆ν, and 3) reducing fb
until the neutrino radiation is acceptable.

3 DISCUSSION

The physics motivation for each of the parameter sets in ta-
ble 1 is discussed in [2]. Brieﬂy, the number of µµ → ee
events gives a benchmark estimate of the discovery poten-
tial for elementary particles at the full CoM energy of the
collider, while the production of hypothesized 100 GeV
Higgs particles indicates roughly how the colliders would
perform in studying physics at this ﬁxed energy scale.

Both parameter sets give exciting luminosities with good
potential to explore the physics processes at and below their
respective CoM energy scales.

The output luminosity may be derived in terms of the

input parameters as:

L[cm−2.s−1] = 2.11 × 1033 × HB × (1 − e−2tD[γτµ])
× fb[s−1](N0[1012])2(ECoM[TeV])3

This formula uses the standard MCC assumption[1] that the
ratio of transverse to longitudinal emittances can be chosen
in the muon cooling channel to maximize the luminosity
for a given ǫ6N. The pinch enhancement factor, HB, is very
close to unity (see table 1), and the numerical coefﬁcient
in equation 1 includes a geometric correction factor of 0.76
for the non-zero bunch length, σz = β∗ (the “hourglass
effect”) .

In practice, the muon beam power and current are lim-
ited so the optimization of parameters actually involves the
“speciﬁc luminosity”

Further, the parameter sets at these high energies are al-
ways limited by ∆ν and it is useful and easy to rewrite

it may well be necessary to build the colliders at isolated
sites where the public would not be exposed to the neutrino
radiation disk.

4 CONCLUSIONS

Muon colliders from 10 to 100 TeV CoM energies may of-
fer an exciting long-term future to experimental HEP and
are not obviously infeasible to this author. However, they
clearly introduce some daunting new challenges beyond
those common to all muon colliders and the parameter sets
in table 1 will require some technological extrapolations.

with no explicit dependence on emittance for a given en-
ergy. This is misleading, however, since smaller emittances
mean smaller magnet apertures and hence allow the design
of lattices with smaller β∗’s and, in practice, one can al-
most always gain in speciﬁc luminosity by reoptimizing
parameter sets with smaller emittances.

The assumed 6-dimensional emittances are factors of
3.5 (10 TeV) and 50 (100 TeV) smaller than the value
170 × 10−12 m3 that is normally used in MCC scenarios
for ﬁrst generation muon colliders, in anticipation that the
muon cooling channel may eventually be improved through
further design optimization, stronger magnets, higher gra-
dient rf cavities and other technological advancements and
innovations.

The ﬁnal focus region presumably presents the most dif-
ﬁcult design challenge that is relatively speciﬁc to high
energy muon colliders.
(The muon cooling channel is,
of course, a formidable challenge for all muon colliders.)
Progressively stronger focusing is required at higher en-
ergies to generate the smaller spot sizes necessary to in-
crease the luminosity. The strength of the focusing can
be gauged from the overall beam demagniﬁcation, deﬁned
as M ≡
βmax/β∗. This is a dimensionless parameter
that should be closely correlated with fractional tolerances
in magnet uniformity, residual chromaticity etc. Hence,
it might be prudent to decrease the fractional momentum
spread of the beams, δ, to compensate for an increasing
M . In the absence of ﬁnal focus designs for these param-
eter sets the difﬁculty of the chromatic correction for the
ﬁnal focus has simplistically been assessed by the value
of a single parameter:
the “chromaticity quality factor”
q ≡ M δ [3].

p

In the absence of “proof by example” lattice designs,
the next generation of proposed linear e+e- colliders (LC’s)
may well provide the best benchmarks for heuristically as-
sessing the difﬁculty of the ﬁnal focus parameters. For the
10 TeV parameter set, each of β∗, M and q are roughly
comparable to those proposed for these LC’s. The 100 TeV
parameter set necessarily has a much larger β∗ and M but
the value of δ was forced down to δ = 8 × 10−5 to nearly
hold steady the value of q. Unfortunately, this is clearly in-
consistent with the rising energy loss due to beamstrahlung
at the ip. Following the lead of the LC’s, the next iteration
of the 100 TeV parameter set will use colliding ﬂat beams
to make the parameter sets fully consistent. The spot size
– clearly indicative of vibration and alignment tolerances –
also falls with energy, but even at 100 TeV it remains an
order of magnitude above the spot size in the y coordinate
for future LC design parameters.

Neutrino radiation is an extremely serious problem for
many-TeV muon colliders and further information and dis-
cussion on this can be found in these proceedings [4]. The
radiation levels are predicted to rise rapidly with the col-

lation by the author on how muon colliders might evolve

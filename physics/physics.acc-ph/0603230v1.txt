COUPLING IMPEDANCES OF SMALL DISCONTINUITIES:
DEPENDENCE ON BEAM VELOCITY

Sergey S. Kurennoy
Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545, USA

The beam coupling impedances of small discontinuities of an accelerator vacuum chamber have
been calculated [e.g., S.S. Kurennoy, R.L. Gluckstern, and G.V. Stupakov, Phys. Rev. E 52, 4354
(1995)] for ultrarelativistic beams using the Bethe diﬀraction theory. Here we extend the results
to an arbitrary beam velocity. The vacuum chamber is assumed to have an arbitrary, but uniform
along the beam path, cross section. The longitudinal and transverse coupling impedances are
derived in terms of series over cross-section eigenfunctions, while the discontinuity shape enters
via its polarizabilities. Simple explicit formulas for two important particular cases — circular and
rectangular chamber cross sections — are presented. The impedance dependence on the beam
velocity exhibits some unusual features: for example, the reactive impedance, which dominates in
the ultrarelativistic limit, can vanish at a certain beam velocity, or its magnitude can exceed the
ultrarelativistic value many times. In addition, we demonstrate that the same technique, the ﬁeld
expansion into a series of cross-section eigenfunctions, is convenient for calculating the space-charge
impedance of uniform beam pipes with arbitrary cross section.

INTRODUCTION

A common tendency in design of modern accelerators is
to minimize beam-chamber coupling impedances to avoid
beam instabilities and reduce heating. Even contribu-
tions from tiny discontinuities like pumping holes have
to be accounted for because of their typically large num-
bers. Direct numerical methods encounter diﬃculties
in calculating the impedances of small discontinuities.
The diﬃculties of usual time-domain methods — com-
puting wake potentials and then ﬁnding the impedances
as their Fourier transforms — are mostly technical for
ultrarelativistic beams: one has to apply very ﬁne steps
in wake computations to resolve small obstacles. How-
ever, for non-ultrarelativistic beams the usual numerical
approach fails due to diﬃculty in implementing proper
boundary conditions at the open ends of the beam pipe.
This situation makes analytical methods especially im-
portant. A general analytical approach for calculating
the beam coupling impedances of small discontinuities on
the walls of an accelerator vacuum chamber has been de-
veloped in [1, 2] for ultrarelativistic beams. The method
is based on the Bethe theory of diﬀraction by small holes
[3], according to which the ﬁelds diﬀracted by a hole can
be found as those radiated by eﬀective electric and mag-
netic dipoles.

The Bethe idea of eﬀective dipoles developed in 1944
was ﬁrst used to calculate the coupling impedances of
pumping holes in a circular waveguide for the case of an
ultrarelativistic beam in 1992 [4, 5]. Bethe’s theory is
applicable for wavelengths large compared to the typical
hole size h, and it can be used for impedance calcula-
tions when h is much smaller than the typical dimension
b of the chamber cross section. Within this limitation,
the theory was applied to vacuum chambers with an ar-
bitrary simply-connected cross section in [2], again for
relativistic beams. The imaginary part of the impedance

−

was shown to be proportional to the diﬀerence of hole po-
larizabilities (ψ
χ), where the magnetic susceptibility ψ
and the electric polarizability χ are both small compared
to b3. From considerations of the energy radiated into the
chamber and through the hole, the real part of the hole
impedance comes out to be proportional to (ψ2 + χ2),
being usually much smaller than the reactance. These
results are not restricted to small holes, but remain valid
for other small discontinuities like posts, masks, or irises,
because the idea of eﬀective polarizabilities works equally
well in those cases, as was demonstrated in [6, 7]. A more
reﬁned theory that takes into account the reaction of ra-
diated waves back on the hole was developed in [1]. In
the latter approach, the beam coupling impedances of a
discontinuity come out as perturbative series in polar-
izabilities, more exactly, in small parameters ψ/b3 and
χ/b3: the reactive impedance is the ﬁrst order eﬀect,
while the real part of the impedance has the second or-
der. Moreover, the theory [1] contains non-perturbative
eﬀects: it gives the trapped modes near the pipe cut-oﬀ
frequencies due to some small discontinuities. This eﬀect
was discovered earlier using a diﬀerent method [8].

In the present article we extend the analytical ap-
proach [1, 2] to the case of non-ultrarelativistic beams.
The beam coupling impedances of a small discontinu-
ity on the walls of a vacuum chamber with any simply-
connected cross section are derived for an arbitrary beam
velocity v = βc. The theory gives analytical expressions
for the longitudinal and transverse coupling impedances
in terms of series over cross-section eigenfunctions. The
shape of the discontinuity enters via its electric and mag-
netic polarizabilities. Previous results for ultrarelativis-
tic beams are naturally reproduced in the limit of β
1.
Simple explicit expressions for the impedances of non-
ultrarelativistic beams are derived for circular and rect-
angular chamber cross sections.

→

One should mention a few earlier results related to

the subject. The coupling impedances of a small hole
in a circular beam pipe were calculated [9] for β < 1
in the form of series involving roots of Bessel functions.
Closed-form expressions of the hole impedances for non-
relativistic beams in a cylindrical vacuum chamber with
a circular cross section were obtained by Gluckstern et
al [10, 11]. The longitudinal impedance of a small round
hole in a circular waveguide was derived in a closed form
for a beam with β < 1 and a ﬁnite transverse size in [12].
In a somewhat related paper [13], the bunch loss factors
were investigated for non-ultrarelativistic beams. All the
results above, however, have been restricted to the par-
ticular case of an axisymmetric vacuum chamber. Our
study treats a more general case of an arbitrary chamber
cross section.

In addition, we show that the same technique —
based on ﬁeld expansions in cross-section eigenfunctions
— works very eﬃciently for deriving the space-charge
impedance of a uniform waveguide having an arbitrary
cross section. A general expression is obtained that in-
cludes frequency corrections to and beam-velocity depen-
dence of the space-charge g-factor. In the particular case
of a circular cross section, the results coincide with the
known ones, e.g. [11]. For a rectangular chamber, the
space-charge impedance is expressed in the form of a sim-
ple series convenient for computation.

The paper is organized as follows. A general anal-
ysis of the beam ﬁelds and ﬁelds scattered by a small
discontinuity in the vacuum chamber is given in Sec. II.
Section III presents the derivation and results for the cou-
pling impedances of small discontinuities. In Sec. IV the
space-charge impedance of a homogeneous chamber with
an arbitrary cross section is calculated. The eigenfunc-
tions and some derivations for the two particular cases of
the vacuum chamber — with a circular and rectangular
cross section — are presented in the Appendices.

II. FIELDS

Let us consider an inﬁnite cylindrical pipe with an ar-
bitrary cross section S and perfectly conducting walls.
The z axis is directed along the pipe axis, a small dis-
continuity (e.g., a hole) is located in the cross section
z = 0 at the point (~b, 0), and a typical hole size h satis-
ﬁes h
b. The discontinuity is considered small when its
size is much smaller than the wavelength of interest. To
evaluate the coupling impedance one has to calculate the
ﬁelds induced in the chamber by a given current. Con-
sider a charge q that moves on or parallel to the cham-
ber axis with velocity v = βc. A rigid bunch is usually
assumed for wake or impedance calculations. It is con-
venient to choose a ”pancake” charge distribution such
that the charge and current densities are given by

One more remark about Eqs. (5) is worthwhile. Since
the lowest eigenvalue kg is of the order of 1/b, in the
long-wavelength limit, κb = ωb/(βγc)
1, the sums
in Eqs. (5)-(6) become independent of frequency and of
β. The only remaining dependence on the beam veloc-
1/β seems counter-intuitive: one would expect
ity Eν ∝
β. The apparent contradiction disappears as soon
Hτ ∝
as we recall that Eqs. (5) give the ﬁeld harmonics with
wavenumber k = ω/(βc), not the beam ﬁelds in time
domain.

Now we have to calculate the ﬁelds scattered into the
vacuum chamber by the discontinuity. According to the

Bethe theory, at distances l such that h

major axis of the hole). Formulas for polarizabilities of
various discontinuities are collected in the handbook [15],
see also Ref. [16].

When the eﬀective dipoles are obtained by substitut-
ing beam ﬁelds (5) into Eqs. (7), one can calculate the
scattered ﬁelds as a sum of waveguide eigenmodes excited
in the chamber by the dipoles, and ﬁnd the impedance.
This approach has been carried out for a circular pipe in
[4], and for an arbitrary chamber in [2], for ultrarelativis-
tic beams. The ﬁelds radiated into the chamber by the
eﬀective dipoles (7) can be found as a series in TM- and

From Eqs. (9)-(15), using the eﬀective dipoles (7) in-
duced on the discontinuity by the beam ﬁelds (5), we ﬁnd
the ﬁelds scattered by the discontinuity into the vacuum
chamber. Note that the dependence on the beam velocity
enters explicitly only in Eq. (5). Now we proceed with
the impedance calculation.

III. BEAM COUPLING IMPEDANCE OF A
SMALL DISCONTINUITY

A. Longitudinal Impedance

In a general case, the longitudinal impedance is deﬁned
(e.g., [17, 18]) as an integral along the vacuum chamber
of the (synchronous with the beam) harmonic of the lon-
gitudinal electric ﬁeld Ez created in the chamber by the
leading charge (1) divided by the amplitude of the cor-
responding harmonic of the beam current (1). The ﬁeld
Ez should be taken at the longitudinal position of a unit
test charge that follows the leading one with the same ve-
locity, and should also be integrated over the test-charge
transverse distribution t(~r ). This leads to the formula

continuity. The ﬁrst one is related to the space-charge
impedance and vanishes at γ

Sec. IV. Here we include into Ez only the discontinuity
contribution. All z-dependence in Eq. (9) is in the expo-
nents, so integrating over z is straightforward. For trans-
verse integration, we expand the test-charge transverse

2πβc/ω is large compared to the typical cross-section size
b. Equation (21) has a simple physical interpretation. It
gives a solution for a 2D electrostatic ﬁeld created on
the chamber wall in the cross section S by a uniform in
z charge, equal to ε0 per unit length of z, that has the
transverse distribution f (~r ). From the Gauss law, eν(f )

Eq. (22) by itself provides the solution, due to the prob-
lem symmetry: eν(f ; 0) = 1/(2πb), cf. [2, 4].

When the test charge distribution is identical to that
of the leading charge, t(~r ) = f (~r ), Eq. (18) gives the

where the eﬀective polarizabilities ˜αm and ˜αm are now
deﬁned per unit length of the circumference 2πb of the
chamber cross section (circle) S. In transition from the
ﬁrst line in Eq. (30) to the second one, we used the
known expression for eν(0; κ) in a circular cross section,
cf. Eq. (28). Essentially, for an axisymmetric discontinu-
ity αm,e in Eqs. (26) and (28) are replaced by 2πb ˜αm,e.
In the ultrarelativistic limit, β
1, Eq. (30) coincides
with the previous results [6, 7]. It is worth mentioning
that if an axisymmetric enlargement has area A of the
longitudinal cross section, its magnetic polarizability is
˜αm = A, while for an axisymmetric protrusion (iris) of
the same cross-section area ˜αm =
A. The electric po-
larizability ˜αe can be found by solving a 2D electrostatic
problem, see examples in [6, 7, 16]. It is positive for pro-
trusions and negative for enlargements, so that in both
cases ˜αm and ˜αe have opposite signs.

The longitudinal impedances (24), (26), and also (30),
depend on the beam velocity in two ways: via eν(~s ; κ)
and in the combination of polarizabilities (αm + αe/β2).
The ﬁrst dependence enters via the parameter κb =
ωb/(βγc), as one can see from Eqs. (25), (28)-(30). For
κb
ν(~s ; κ) is close to its ultrarelativistic
limit, while at κb > 1 it decreases exponentially to zero.
We should emphasize that for β < 1 the monopole longi-
tudinal impedance depends on the beam position in the
chamber cross section, unlike its ultrarelativistic coun-
terpart [18]. For a circular cross section this dependence
takes a particularly simple form as an additional factor
of I 2
0 (κt) in (28) and (30), where t is the beam transverse
displacement from the chamber axis, see Eq. (A3) in the
Appendix.

−

In the combination αm + αe/β2 the electric contribu-
tion is enhanced as the beam velocity decreases. This
sum (more exactly, this diﬀerence, because αm and αe al-
ways have opposite signs) can either vanish for some val-
ues of β, or become much larger than its ultrarelativistic
limit αm + αe. It vanishes when 0 < β =
αe/αm < 1.
We should note that such situation occurs only for dis-
continuities like holes or chamber enlargements (small

circular hole of radius h in a thin wall has αm = 4h3/3

and αe =
impedance (26) of the hole, which is inductive for rela-
tivistic beams, changes its sign for β < 1/√2 becoming
a “negative inductance”. On the other hand, for pro-
trusions and irises the impedance remains inductive for
any beam velocity because of αe >
, cf. [6, 7]. As
a simple example, a semi-spherical protrusion (bump) of
radius a on the wall has polarizabilities αe = 2πa3 and

studied by taking into account radiative corrections to
the ﬁelds near the discontinuity. The second-order term
has both an imaginary and real part; the last one appears
only at frequencies above the chamber cutoﬀ. The real
part of the impedance includes contributions from only
a ﬁnite number of the eigenmodes propagating in the
chamber at a given frequency, i.e. those with kg < ω/c
or k′
g < ω/c. The dependence of Re Z on frequency is

B. Transverse Impedance

−

Since we are interested in the dipole transverse
impedance, it is convenient to consider the excitation by
a dipole: two point charges with the opposite signs dis-
~s, correspond-
placed from the chamber axis by ~s and
ingly, instead of Eq. (1), moving at velocity βc along
the axis. Such a change would modify the expression
(24) for the longitudinal impedance replacing eν(~s ; κ) by
edip
eν(0; κ), which is the second (dipole)
ν (0; κ) = ~s
term of its Taylor expansion, with eν(0; κ) being the ﬁrst
(monopole) one. After normalizing the excitation to the
unit transverse beam displacement (dividing by s), we in-
tegrate the synchronous harmonic of the transverse force
acting on a test charge displaced from the axis by ~t, and
then divide by the harmonic amplitude of the dipole mo-
ment creating the deﬂecting force:

where the usual deﬁnition of the dipole transverse

[17]. The integration result includes contributions from
both TM- and TE-modes excited by the eﬀective dipoles
in the beam pipe, unlike the expression for the longitu-
dinal impedance (24), where only TM-modes contribute.
There is an alternative way to ﬁnd the transverse
impedance. Since we already have expression (24) for

→

→

the generalized longitudinal impedance Z(~s, ~t; ω), we can
apply the Panofsky-Wenzel theorem, e.g., in [18]. Ac-
cording to the theorem, the transverse impedance can be
derived as

~Z⊥(~s, ~t ; ω) =

βc
ωs

~
∇tZ(~s, ~t ; ω) ,

(33)

where the longitudinal impedance is calculated with the
dipole excitation as discussed above.
If we follow this
way, which is simpler in our case, the result will include
only TM-mode contributions, or, in other words, the EFs
of (4), since only they enter Eq. (24) for the longitudinal
impedance. We used the relations between the trans-
verse components of the beam ﬁelds, cf. Eq. (5), to prove
that the two results obtained are equivalent. One should
remark that deﬁnition (32) sometimes includes an extra
factor 1/β, e.g. in [17]. For consistency with the rela-
tion (33), here we use the transverse impedance deﬁnition
without that extra factor, i.e., Eq. (32).

The impedance dependence on the discontinuity shape
is obviously the same as for the longitudinal impedance.
The direction of the vector of the transverse impedance
(34) gives the direction of the deﬂecting force acting on
a displaced beam. As one can see from Eq. (34), this
direction is deﬁned by vector ~d, Eq. (35), while the force
magnitude varies depending on the relative direction of
the beam displacement ~s with respect to ~d via the scalar
product ˆs

~d.

For a circular beam pipe, the transverse impedance

simply as

where ˆh = ~b/b is a unit vector in the chamber cross sec-

In this case, one can rewrite the dot product in a more

ϕh), where ϕs is the
conventional form, ˆs
azimuthal angle of the beam position in the cross-section
plane, and ϕh is the azimuthal angle in the direction to
the hole. Therefore, the deﬂecting force in the circular
pipe is directed to (or opposite to) the discontinuity, and
its magnitude depends on the angle between the hole and
the beam transverse displacement, as was pointed out al-
ready in the relativistic case [4]. Equation (36) agrees,
up to notations, with the result obtained in [10].

the dipole transverse impedance (34) as

In particular, this form is more convenient for the rect-
angular chamber. Here d =
y, where x, y are
the horizontal and vertical coordinates in the chamber
cross section S, and dx and dy are projections of ~d, cf.
Appendix B; ϕs = ϕt is again the azimuthal angle of the
beam position in the cross-section plane; ˆd = ~d/d is a unit
vector in this plane in the direction of ~d, and ϕd is the
corresponding azimuthal angle. Obviously, dx = d cos ϕd
and dy = d sin ϕd. It is seen from Eq. (37) that the an-
gle ϕd shows the direction of the transverse-impedance
vector ~Z⊥ and, therefore, of the beam-deﬂecting force.
Moreover, the magnitude of Z⊥ is maximal when the
beam is deﬂected along this direction and vanishes when
the beam oﬀset is perpendicular to it. For a circular pipe,
ϕd = ϕh, as was discussed above. For a general cross sec-
tion, this is not the case even in the relativistic limit; see
[2] for rectangular and elliptic chambers. As an illustra-
tion, in Fig. 3 we plot the relation between ϕd and ϕh
for a square chamber for a few diﬀerent values of param-
eter κb = ωb/(βγc). The case κb = 0 corresponds to the
relativistic (or low-frequency) limit; as κb increases, the
diﬀerence between ϕd and ϕh becomes smaller.

strates also the impedance dependence on the position of

well as Figs. 1-2, were produced using Mathematica [20].
It takes less than ten terms in the series (B6) and (B3)
to get a very accurate answer for the sum, which is not
surprising since the 10th term in (B3) is of the order of
O(e−30) = O(10−13). However, even with hundreds of
terms Mathematica gives the results almost as quickly as
those involving modiﬁed Bessel functions for the circular
pipe in Figs. 1-2.

One should remind that the impedance magnitude de-
creases even faster with the frequency increase for a
d2. The full
ﬁxed β than shown in Fig. 4, since Z⊥ ∝
β-dependence of the transverse impedance includes, of
course, the shape factor βαm + αe/β; overall, it is sim-
ilar to that of the longitudinal impedance illustrated in
Figs. 1-2.

IV. SPACE-CHARGE IMPEDANCE

We will show in this Section that the same approach
as above — based on ﬁeld expansions in cross-section
eigenfunctions — works equally well for calculating the
space-charge impedance of a uniform waveguide with an
arbitrary simply-connected cross section. While this sub-
ject seems to be somewhat oﬀ topic for the present paper,
the result comes as a by-product of the considerations
in the previous Sections. The synchronous harmonic of
the longitudinal beam ﬁeld produced in a uniform beam
pipe with the cross section S by the current (2) is given
by Eq. (6). Using the impedance deﬁnition (16) with the
ﬁnite integration length L and assuming the same trans-
verse charge distribution for the test charge as for the
source, t(~r ) = f (~r ), we obtain the space-charge longitu-
dinal impedance per unit length of the chamber

8

for a beam with the transverse charge distribution f (~r ).
The space-charge impedance (38) is expressed in terms of
eigenvalues kg of the boundary problem (4) and the ex-
pansion coeﬃcients fg of the charge distribution in EFs
S d~r f (~r )eg(~r ). Every term of the series in
(4), fg =
Eq. (38) is positive, so that the space-charge impedance
R
always remains a “negative inductance”. It is important
to emphasize that the dependence on the beam charge
distribution is an essential feature of the space-charge
impedance. For example, one can not use a pencil beam
(point charge) in (38): the space-charge impedance di-
verges as the beam transverse size vanishes, e.g. [18]. On
the contrary, the geometrical impedances discussed in the
previous sections are generally independent of the beam
properties, at least in the relativistic limit, and for that
reason they are usually calculated in the simplest way,
that is with an on-axis pencil beam.

Let us compare Eq. (38) with the conventional form of
the space-charge impedance in the long-wavelength ap-

the limit at κ

term consideration of series (40), it is easy to prove that
g-factor is positive, gL(κ) > 0, and that frequency cor-
rections reduce its value: gL(κ) < gL(0).

In the well-studied particular case of a circular cross
section, we consider the beam in the form of a thin ax-
isymmetric ring of radius a, f (~r ) = δ(r
a)/(2πa). The

0 < ζ < 1. Even in a simpler case of a square chamber,
a = b, the space-charge factor (40) of the square hollow
beam ζa

the leading term of Eq. (42) is ln (1/ζ)/(2π), exactly the
same as in the case of a circular pipe above. The se-
ries (42) converges slower than the series in (29) or (B6),
so up to 2500 terms were included in our Mathematica
computations for this series. Still it took only a couple
of minutes of CPU time on a PC to produce Figs. 5-6.
They illustrate the behavior of S(f ; κ) (42) as a function
of the frequency and beam size. It is interesting that the
sum S(f, 0) (relativistic or static limit) is very close to its
ln asymptotic even for the beam size as large as one half
of the pipe size, ζ = 0.5, cf. Fig. 5. The frequency de-
pendence of the space-charge impedance (more precisely,
of the g-factor) plotted in Fig. 6 is weaker than that for
the impedances of small discontinuities in Fig. 4.

V. DISCUSSION

The approach of Refs. [1, 2], where the impedances
of small discontinuities were calculated in the ultrarela-
tivistic case, was extended to beams with an arbitrary
velocity and transverse charge distribution. The analyt-
ical approach presented above provides a general picture
of the coupling impedances for small discontinuities of the
vacuum chamber with an arbitrary cross section in a wide
frequency range, up to frequencies well above the cutoﬀ.
The upper limit on the frequency is imposed by the ap-

plicability of the Bethe theory: the wavelength must be
large compared to the typical size of the discontinuity.

We concentrated mostly on the leading (imaginary)
part of the impedances created by discontinuities. In a
general case, it was shown that the coupling impedances
of small discontinuities depend on the beam velocity in
two ways: ﬁrst, through the combination of polariz-
abilities (αm + αe/β2), and second, via the parameter
κ = ω/(βγc) that enters into the factors eν(κ) for the
longitudinal impedance, see Eqs. (28)-(30), and d(κ) for
the transverse one, Eqs. (34)-(37). The ﬁrst factor con-
tains all the impedance dependence on the discontinuity
shape, while the second one accounts for eﬀects of the
chamber cross section and the discontinuity location on
the cross-section boundary. The second factor behaves
in the same way for various cross sections:
it decreases
from its value at κ = 0, which can be interpreted as ei-
ther the ultrarelativistic or long-wavelength limit, as κ
increases. The decrease rate depends to some extent on
the cross-section shape and the discontinuity position,
but for κb > 1 the decrease is fast (exponential), as evi-
denced by Eqs. (28), (30) and (36), as well as by Fig. 4.
The overall impedance dependence on the beam velocity
for small discontinuities was discussed in Sec. III. The
most interesting feature is that the impedance magni-
tude for some β < 1 can exceed its relativistic value many
times, see Figs. 1-2.

The impedances for the circular and rectangular cross
sections of the vacuum chamber were derived from the
obtained formulas by substituting corresponding EFs.
The expressions can be useful for calculating the beam
coupling impedances in particle accelerators with non-
ultrarelativistic beams. For the circular pipe our results
agree with those obtained earlier for β < 1 in [10, 11].
In a similar way, the results for an elliptic chamber can
be expressed in terms of Mathieu functions; it seems un-
likely, however, that such a series would be convenient
for calculations. For a complicated cross-section shape
the relativistic-limit factors eν(0) and d(0) can be found

numerically by solving a 2D electrostatic problem, see
[2] for an elliptical pipe. Applying the results obtained
above, one can give then an impedance estimate for a
given beam velocity in such a chamber.

We also demonstrated that the same technique — us-
ing the ﬁeld expansion into a series of cross-section eigen-
functions – works well for calculating the space-charge
impedance of a uniform vacuum chamber with an arbi-
trary cross section. A generalized expression g(κ) for the

longitudinal space-charge g-factor is derived. It depends
on the beam velocity and on frequency, in addition to
the usual dependence on the transverse beam-charge dis-
tribution. The generalized g-factor g(κ) decreases mono-
tonically as κ increases: g(0)
g(κ) > 0. It is worthwhile
to notice that the long-wavelength (or relativistic) limit-
ing value g(0) can be calculated numerically even for very
complicated vacuum chambers, e.g., those with screening
wires and ceramic insertions [21].

APPENDIX A: CIRCULAR CHAMBER

For a circular cross section of radius b the eigenval-
ues knm = µnm/b, where µnm is mth zero of the Bessel

summation was performed using formulas from [19]. The
impedances of a hole in a circular pipe for β < 1 were de-
rived in [9] in terms of sums similar to that in the second
line of Eq. (A3). The resulting sum (A3) is essentially
a multipole expansion. In the limit of an on-axis beam,

For calculating the transverse impedance, we need to
ﬁnd the gradient of the ﬁeld (A3) at the origin, cf. deﬁ-
nition (35). Only the second term (n = 1) in the series

which coincides with the result [1] for the rectangular
chamber. For some particular values of v, e.g. v = 1/2,
the sum Σ(u, v) can be expressed in terms of the com-
plete elliptic integrals; in general, it is easy to calculate
the series numerically because of its fast (exponential)
convergence. Its behavior versus v for diﬀerent values of
the aspect ratio u was plotted in Ref. [2].

for calculating the transverse impedance. In the Carte-

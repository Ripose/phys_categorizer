A composite open resonator for compact X-ray source

The results of calculation of the ﬁnesse of a composite open resonator for compact X-ray source are presented.

The region of the resonator parameters has been found where the ﬁnesse is changed unessentially.

1. Introduction

Currently there has been considerable progress
in the development of super-reﬂection mirrors,
high-ﬁnesse optical resonators (super-resonators)
and frequency stabilized high power cw and
pulsed mode-locked lasers. Optical resonators
can be used as a photon storage to accumulate a
very high laser power. By this method, a ﬁnesse
of the optical resonators of 106 can be achieved,
which means the laser power can be enhanced by
this order [1]. The high reactive power stored in
the super-resonators can be used in gravitational
experiments in astrophysics, Laser-Electron Stor-
age Rings [1] - [4], gravitational analogue of lasers
(grasers) [5] or other applications.

The main reason for mirror degradation of high
ﬁnesse dielectric open resonators of free-electron
lasers based on storage rings is the deposition of
chemical components on the mirror surface by X-
ray synchrotron radiation [6]. The same degra-
dation can occur in Laser-Electron Storage Rings
where the backward Compton scattering of laser
photons by electron beams is used for production
of X-ray and γ-ray radiation [2], [3]. Possible so-
lution of the mirror degradation problem is us-
ing of a composite resonator. Below the results
of calculation of the dependence of the ﬁnesse of
such a composite resonator on its parameters are
presented and analyzed.

2. Quality of the composite open resonator

Let a composite open resonator consist of two
mirrors (see Fig.1). The reﬂectivity of the ﬁrst
mirror M1 and the main part of the second mir-

ror M2 are R1. The second mirror has a circular
insertion at the axis of the resonator made from
another material with the reﬂectivity R2. The ra-
dius of the insertion is ”a”, the rms radius of the
fundamental mode of the resonator at the surface
of the mirror is ”σLm”. Both mirrors can be di-
electric multilayer mirrors and the insertion part
in one in two mirrors can be coated by Au.

3. Conclusion

We have considered a composite open res-
onator. One of its mirrors has a small circu-
lar insertion at the axis of the resonator made
from another much lower ﬁnesse material. It was
shown that if the dimension of the insertion is
larger than the eﬀective transverse dimension of
the X-ray beam and much less than the diameter
of the fundamental mode the mirror degradation
time can be increased to a great extent and the
ﬁnesse of the resonator is decreased unessentially.
Such conditions can be fulﬁlled when the magni-
ﬁcation M

The generation of a ﬂat electron beam directly from a photoinjector is an attractive alternative
to the electron damping ring as envisioned for linear colliders. It also has potential applications to
light sources such as the generation of ultra-short x-ray pulses or Smith-Purcell free electron lasers.
In this Letter, we report on the experimental generation of a ﬂat-beam with a measured transverse
emittance ratio of 100 ± 20.2 for a bunch charge of ∼ 0.5 nC; the smaller measured normalized
root-mean-square emittance is ∼ 0.4 µm and is limited by the resolution of our experimental setup.
The experimental data, obtained at the Fermilab/NICADD Photoinjector Laboratory, are compared
with numerical simulations and the expected scaling laws.

Flat electron beams, e.g. beams with large trans-
verse emittance ratios, have been proposed in the con-
text of linear colliders and some novel electron-beam-

lider, a ﬂat beam at the interaction point reduces the
luminosity disruption caused by beamsstrahlung [1]. In
the case of light sources, such as the LUX project pro-
posed at LBL [2], a ﬂat beam with a smaller emittance
of 0.3 µm and emittance ratio of 50 is needed to pro-
duce x-ray pulses that can be compressed to the order of
femtoseconds via standard x-ray pulse compression tech-
niques [3]. Another type of light source recently drawing
attention is based on self-ampliﬁcation of Smith-Purcell
radiation [4]. Given one or two planar metal gratings, a
ﬂat beam could enhance the interaction between the elec-
trons and metal grating surface, thus reducing the gain
length associated with the Smith-Purcell free-electron-
laser mechanism [5, 6, 7].

In the proposed International Linear Collider (ILC) the
needed ﬂat-beam parameters (emittance ratio of 300) are
foreseen to be achieved via radiation cooling in a damp-
ing ring [8]. Although the required transverse emittances
for the ILC have been demonstrated at the ATF damp-
ing ring of KEK [9], ILC puts stringent requirements on
the damping ring design, and the cost of the damping
ring is a signiﬁcant portion of the total collider cost.
Therefore alternative ways of producing ﬂat beams di-
rectly from an electron source have been explored by sev-
eral groups [10]. In conjunction with the invention of a
linear transformation capable of transforming an incom-
ing ﬂat beam into an angular-momentum-dominated (or
“magnetized”) beam [11], a scheme which inverses this

transformation was proposed to generate a ﬂat beam di-
rectly out of a photoinjector [12]. The method consists of
generating an magnetized beam by immersing the pho-
tocathode in an axial magnetic ﬁeld. After acceleration,
the beam is transformed into a ﬂat beam using three
skew quadrupoles [13]. This has been veriﬁed experimen-
tally [14, 15, 16, 17], and transverse emittance ratios of
40-50 were reported. Theoretical analysis of the conver-
sion of a magnetized cylindrically-symmetric beam into
a ﬂat beam has been presented [18, 19] and some of the
associated limitations explored [20, 21]. In the present
Letter we report on an improvement of the experimental
conditions and methods that led to a measured transverse
emittance ratio of approximately 100.
The ﬂat-beam experiment was

carried out at
the Fermilab/NICADD [30] Photoinjector Laboratory
(FNPL) [22]; see Fig. 1 for the layout. In brief, electron
bunches with variable charge (Q ≤20 nC) are generated
via photoemission from a cesium telluride photocathode
located at the back plate of a 1+1/2 cell radio-frequency
(rf) cavity operating at 1.3 GHz (the “rf gun”). The
beam is then accelerated in a 1.3 GHz superconducting rf
cavity (the booster cavity) [23] to approximately 16 MeV.
The rf gun is surrounded by three solenoidal lenses that
are designed to control the beam transverse emittance.
For ﬂat-beam production the ﬁrst solenoidal lens (L1) is
turned oﬀ, and the two others (L2 and L3) are tuned to
provide the desired magnetic ﬁeld on the photocathode
along with the proper focusing. The beam is thereby
produced in the presence of a signiﬁcant axial magnetic
ﬁeld and has an average angular momentum given by
hLi = eB0σ2
c , where e is the electron charge, B0 the ax-
ial magnetic ﬁeld on the photocathode surface, and σc
the root-mean-square (rms) transverse size of the drive-
laser spot on the photocathode. The transformation of
the magnetized beam into a ﬂat beam occurs downstream
of the booster cavity. Three skew quadrupoles (S1, S2,
and S3 in Fig. 1) provide a net torque on the beam

thereby removing its initial angular momentum [24, 25].
The skew quadrupoles are henceforth referred to as the
“transformer”. Given the incoming 4 × 4 beam covari-
ance matrix Σ0, the quadrupole strengths are set to pro-
vide the proper transport matrix M so that the covari-
M
ance matrix at the exit of the transformer, Σ = M Σ0
(where the upper tilde denote the transpose), is block-
diagonal. An analytical solution for the quadrupole set-
f
tings was derived under the thin-lens approximation for
the quadrupoles [16] . This solution is used as a starting
point for a simplex minimization algorithm that searches
the quadrupole settings to minimize the ﬁgure-of-merit

The ﬂat-beam emittances are measured using the slit
method [26]. A movable single-slit assembly (either ver-
tical or horizontal), located at position X7 (see Fig. 1),
is used to sample the beam in one direction. The slit
assembly consists of a ∼ 50 µm slit made of a 3 mm
thick tungsten block. The beamlet passing through the
slit is observed after a drift of distance D, at the lo-
cation X8. Given the measured horizontal beam size
at X7, σX7

X8 when a vertical slit is inserted at X7, σX8,h

screen. The measured rms beam size, σmeas,

fected by the resolution of the diagnostics σres and spu-

ment method used to report emittances in the following
was numerically benchmarked [25]. The resolution of the
beam size measurement system which includes the optical
components and a charged coupled device (CCD) camera
was characterized for various operating points [25]. For
all the quoted measurements of transverse beam sizes,
we quadratically subtract the smallest measured resolu-
tion (σres = 35 µm). The unavoidable contribution from
spurious dispersion (discussed later) results in an overes-
timated value for the smaller ﬂat-beam emittance. Hence
the emittance ratio reported hereafter is underestimated.
For the ﬂat-beam experiment reported in this Letter,
the nominal operating parameters for the photoinjector
are reported in Table I. The rf-gun and booster-cavity
settings are kept the same during the experiment while
the drive-laser spot size on the photocathode and the
solenoid currents are adjusted for the diﬀerent sets of
measurements.

Given the experimental conditions, numerical simu-
lations are performed with the tracking program As-
tra [27]. Using the simulation outputs of the beam prop-
erties at the entrance of the transformer, the aforemen-
tioned simplex minimization algorithm is used to deter-
mine the skew quadrupole settings needed to transform
the magnetized round beam into a ﬂat beam. In the ex-
periment, the quadrupole settings are then empirically
ﬁne-tuned to insure the x-y correlation on the beam has
been removed downstream of the transformer. This is
achieved by observing the beam transverse image on the

viewers downstream of the transformer: upon removal
of the angular momentum, the beam should remain ﬂat
and upright. In Table II we compare, for two cases of rms
drive-laser spot sizes (σc=0.76 mm and σc =0.97 mm),
the ﬁnal quadrupole currents used in the experiment
with the initial values obtained numerically. Most of
the quadrupole currents agree with predicted values, the
larger discrepancies observed for the settings of the last
quadrupole reﬂect a looser tolerance on this quadrupole
setting [21].

For the transverse emittance measurements, the beam
images on the diﬀerent viewers are taken for a single-
bunch beam. In Figure 2, we present the set of experi-
mental images, along with their respective simulated im-
ages, needed to infer the two transverse ﬂat-beam emit-
tances. Several shots of each of the particular images
are taken and analyzed to obtain the rms beam sizes.
The results are then averaged and a statistical error is
attributed to the mean. Given the uncertainty of the
measurement method the systematic errors are estimated
from error propagation. The rms beam sizes are esti-
mated on 95% of the total integrated image intensity. In
Table III, we gather the measured and simulated param-

the photoemission process of the cesium telluride mate-

emittance of the magnetized beam εu
n is measured using
the slit technique from the beam image at X3 and the
corresponding slit images at X5. L has been obtained
with the two diﬀerent methods detailed in [17]. The re-
sulting measurements for the case σc = 0.97 mm are
summarized in Table IV: within the experimental errors
we observed that the measured four-dimensional (4-D)
n is conserved during the round-
emittance ε4D ≡
to-ﬂat-beam transformation. We note a ∼25% discrep-
ancy for the measured larger ﬂat-beam emittance, com-
pared to the simulation and the value predicted from the
round beam parameters. This is probably due to imper-
fectly optimized settings for the transformer. We ﬁnally
report the dependence of ε+
n versus L. The value of L
was varied either by changing B0 or σc. As expected ε+
n
is linearly dependent on L, and a linear regression gives
ε+
n = (1.78 ± 0.26)L; see Fig. 3. The slope is in agree-
ment with the theoretically expected slope value of 2 in

In summary we generated and characterized a highly
asymmetric beam in a photoinjector. The lower limit for
the best measured emittance ratio of ∼100 is limited by

our experimental set-up: the fact that the transformation
occurs at low energy along with σδ ≃ 0.25% made our
measurement sensitive to spurious dispersion. Simula-
tions based on steering dipole settings used to correct the
beam orbit indicate that the thereby introduced disper-
sion could result in an overestimation of the smaller ﬂat-
beam emittance by a factor up to 2. Spurious dispersion
accounts for most of the discrepancy between numerical
simulations and measurements. The experiment is lim-
ited to low charge in order to avoid space charge to sig-
niﬁcantly impact the beam dynamics in the transformer
at 16 MeV. Nonetheless our measurements support the
potential ﬂat-beam injector designs either for proposed
light source such as LUX or envisioned Terahertz radia-
tion sources based on Smith-Purcell eﬀect. Our results
also open a possible path for the production of ﬂat e−-
beam for the ILC, where the main challenge is to also
achieve a 4-D emittance ε4D ∼ 0.3 µm for Q = 3.2 nC.
This value is one order of magnitude lower than what our
photoinjector can presently produce at Q = 0.5 nC.

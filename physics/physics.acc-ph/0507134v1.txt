Crossing angle at the photon collider

V.I. Telnov
Institute of Nuclear Physics, 630090 Novosibirsk, Russia

For removal of disrupted beams at the ILC linear e+e− collider it is desirable to collide beams at some crossing angle.
An especially large crossing angle, of about 25 mrad, is necessary for the photon collider, where disrupted beams are
softer and wider than in the e+e− case. Some complications arise due to the solenoidal magnetic ﬁeld of the detector.
Radiation of particles in this ﬁeld can increase the vertical beam size, leading to a loss of the luminosity. In addition,
in the presence of a detector magnetic ﬁeld the beam trajectories are not ﬂat. Moreover, in the case of e−e− beams,
the vertical collision angle is non-zero and larger than the beam diagonal angle σy/σz , and this should be corrected
in some way. In this paper, possible solutions of these problems are considered. It is shown that at the ILC one can
have the interaction region compatible both with e+e− and γγ, γe modes of operation without loss of luminosity.

1. INTRODUCTION

At photon colliders, high energy photon beams are produced by Compton scattering of laser photons oﬀ high
energy electrons in linear colliders [1, 2]. Due to multiple Compton scattering the beams after the e
γ conversion
have a large energy spread: E = (0.02–1)E0 [3, 4, 5, 6]. After the collision with the opposing electron beam, low
10–12 mrad (background from particles with larger angles is less than
energy electrons acquire disruption angles θd
that from other unavoidable backgrounds) [6]. Large energy and angular spreads of the beams present a problem of
the removal of beams from the detector.

The crab-crossing scheme of the beam collisions at e+e− linear colliders [7] presents a very nice solution to the
above problems at the photon collider [3], Fig. 1. Though the collision angle αc is larger than the horizontal diagonal
angle of the beam at the interaction point (IP), σx/σz, there is no loss of the luminosity because each beam is tilted
using a special RF cavity) by the angle αc/2. Due to this collision angle, the outgoing disrupted beams travel outside
the ﬁnal quads. The value of the crab–crossing angle is determined by the disruption angles and by the ﬁnal quad

For e+e− collisions, αc = 20 mrad is one of the considered options. It is very desirable to have the crossing compatible
with both collision modes, i.e. αc

20–25 mrads.

There are several problem associalted with a large crab-crossing angle:

stability of the beam tilt (provided by the crab-cavity) with an accuracy better than (σx/σz)/αc

∼

the increase of the vertical beam size due to radiation in the detector ﬁelds must be much smaller than the
vertical beam size determined by the beam emittance;

the non-zero vertical collision angle at the IP due to the detector ﬁeld should be corrected;

the dilution of the horizontal beam emittance due to the bend (needed for obtaining of the required crossing
angle) should be small, and the bending length should be reasonable.

Below we consider the three last items (the ﬁrst one is a separate technical task) and ﬁnd the maximum value of αc
for the considered detectors that satisﬁes all the above criteria.

The crab-crossing angle for e+e− (IP1) is about αc,1 = 0–
20 mrad, smaller than that for γγ (IP2), which is αc,2 ∼
25 mrad.

a)

Scheme a: the angle between the tunnels is zero This is
the simplest conﬁguration, the only problem: for maxi-
mum beam energies the bending length Lb required for a
small emittance dilution may be too long.

Scheme b: the angle between tunnels is non-zero, bend-
ing angles are minimum, but there may be problems with
the space for detectors and for dumping of beams at IP1.

b)

c)

Scheme c: the angle between tunnels is non-zero, as in
the scheme a) the beams are bent in opposing directions,
there is no problem with the space, but due to diﬀerent
bending angles the maximum energies for IP1 and IP2
are diﬀerent. This scheme has sense only when tunnels
will be used in future for other multi-TeV linear collider.

The choice of scheme depends on the assumed maximum energy of the collider in these tunnels. For the ILC with
2E0 = 1 TeV, the required bending length is quite small and one can use a zero angle between tunnels (scheme a)).
For multi-TeV colliders the schemes b) and c) are preferable, but in the latter case only one IP can work at the
highest energy.

We see that the radial fringe ﬁeld reduces the angle at the IP by a factor of 2 compared to the action of the

longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld. This is a new result.

It is important to note that in the e+e− case each beam has a vertical angle at the IP with respect to the horizontal
plane but their angle with respect to one an other is zero: the beams collide head-on. On the contrary, in the e−e−
case beams collide at the angle 2θy, see Fig. 3 (upper). This situation is acceptable for e+e− collisions. Beams collide
head-on, and the tilt of the collision line is rather small. For example, the vertical displacement of beamstrahlung
photons at the entrance to the ﬁrst quadrupole at the distance 4 m from the IP will only be about 200–300 µm. The
additional spin-precession angle due to the tilt of the collision line is of the order of 1◦, which is negligible and can
be corrected by the spin rotator at the entrance to the linac.

For e−e− collisions, the diagonal angle σy/σz

10−5 is smaller than the relative

collision angle 2θy by a factor of ten, which means a considerable loss of luminosity. The situation can be corrected
by shift of the ﬁrst quadrupoles (they will act as dipole magnets), resulting in the beams colliding in the horizontal
plane, see Fig. 3 (lower). The vertical displacement of the IP of 250-350 µm does not make any problems.

In addition to above method of the correction there is a suggestion to use additional coils in the detector (Detector
Integrated Dipole), which allows to correct not only the collision angle but the vertical position at the IP [10]. I do
not think that these complications are necessary. Moreover, in this case the detector loses its azimuthal symmetry.

4. GROWTH OF THE VERTICAL BEAM SIZE DUE TO SYNCHROTRON RADIATION

The large crab-crossing angle leads to the increase of σy due to synchrotron radiation of particles in the detector
ﬁeld. After emission of the photon(s) the electron comes to the IP with some vertical deﬂection. This eﬀect leads to
the decrease of the luminosity. The additional vertical r.m.s. spread is [8, 13]

The number of photons emitted by the electron in the transverse magnetic ﬁeld B on the length L is [14]

1.4. So, the number of SR photons/electron Nγ

1/137 and θb = eBL/E0 is the bending angle. For example, Bs = 4 T, αc = 30 mrad, L = 4 m

where α

The simulation was done using PHOCOL code [4, 6], which simulates beam collisions at linear colliders in all
modes. It was used for simulation of photon colliders for NLC ZDR, TESLA CDR, TESLA TDR. The eﬀect of
SR was taken into account in the following way. Using the map of the magnetic ﬁeld in the detector (as we saw,
B(z, 0, 0) is suﬃcient), the emission of SR photons was simulated and the deviation of the electron position at the IP

1113

from the case when there is no SR was calculated for each electron. This deviation was added to the initial Gaussian
position of the electron at z = 0. Then all particles were shifted according to their coordinates and angles at the IP
to their starting positions at z > 5σz (or CP-IP distance at the photon collider) and the simulation with account of
all collision eﬀects was started. In the given simulation (e+e− at 2E0=1 TeV) only attraction between particles was
switched on (other processes are not essential).

Beam parameters were taken from U.S. Linear Collider Technology Option Study: 2E0 = 1 TeV, N = 2

For the γγ case, instead of the γγ luminosity I simulated the e−e− luminosity (without the e

γ conversion)
with σy(γγ) = √2σy(e+e−) in order to take into account an eﬀective increase of the vertical beam size due to the
Compton scattering. All interactions between particles were switched oﬀ. The position of the ﬁrst quad (shifted in
the e−e−(γγ) case in order to have a zero collision angle) was z = 3.5–5.7 m for all detectors.

Results of the simulation are presented in Table 4, the statistical accuracy is about

0.5%. We see that the

±

crab-crossing angle αc = 25 mrad is acceptable for all detectors in the e+e− and γγ modes of operation. For αc = 30
mrad, the luminosity loss with the LD(TESLA) detector is already about 12%, but possibly it can be decreased by
proper shaping of the magnetic ﬁeld.

5. CONCLUSION

One of the interaction regions at the linear collider intended for e+e− and then for γγ collisions should have a
crab-crossing angle about 25 mrad. In this paper I considered problems caused by such a large crossing angle. The
vertical collision angle between electron beams due to the detector magnetic ﬁeld can be corrected by shifting the
ﬁrst quadruples. It is shown that the decrease of the e+e− and γγ luminosities due to synchrotron radiation is small
up to the crab-crossing angle αc = 25 mrad. So, one can have the interaction region at the ILC compatible with
both e+e− and γγ modes of operation.

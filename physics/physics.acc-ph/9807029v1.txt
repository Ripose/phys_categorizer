CAVITY LOSS FACTORS FOR NON-ULTRARELATIVISTIC BEAMS

INTRODUCTION

The beam loss factor is

Abstract

Cavity loss factors can be easily computed for ultrarela-
tivistic beams using time-domain codes like MAFIA or
ABCI. However, for non-ultrarelativistic beams the prob-
lem is more complicated because of difﬁculties with its nu-
merical formulation in the time domain. We calculate the
loss factors of a non-ultrarelativistic bunch and compare
results with the relativistic case.

It is common to believe that loss factors of a bunch mov-
ing along an accelerator structure at velocity v = βc with
β < 1 are lower than those for the same bunch in the ul-
trarelativistic case, β
1. The loss factors are then com-
puted numerically for the ultrarelativistic bunch, which is
a relatively straightforward task, and considered as upper
estimates for the case in question, β < 1.

→

We study β-dependence of loss factors in an attempt to
develop a method to obtain answers for β < 1 case from
the results for β = 1. It is demonstrated that the above as-
sumption on the upper estimate might be incorrect in some
cases, depending on the bunch length and properties of the
structure (cavity + pipe) under consideration.

2 BEAM COUPLING IMPEDANCE AND

LOSS FACTORS OF A CAVITY

In the frequency domain and in the ”closed-cavity” approx-
imation (which means very narrow beam pipes) the beam
coupling impedance calculation can be reduced to an inter-
nal eigenvalue boundary problem. Let ~Es, ~Hs be a com-
plete set of eigenfunctions (EFs) for the boundary prob-
lem in a closed cavity with perfect walls. The longitudinal
impedance is then given by (e.g., [1])

There is a resonant enhancement of the s-th term in the

In principle, Eq. (4) give us the dependence of the loss

“closed-cavity” approximation. Moreover, it is practical
only when the number of strong resonances is reasonably
small, since their the β-dependence varies from one reso-

For a cylindrical cavity in the limit of a vanishing radius of
beam pipes, b
0, one can obtained explicit expressions
of the mode frequencies and impedances, e.g., [1]. Let the
cavity length be L and its radius be d. The mode index
s = (m, n, p) means that there are m radial variations and
p longitudinal ones of the mode E-ﬁeld. The resonance

ticular parameter values, k010(β) can be many times larger
than k010(1). A picture for a longer bunch is similar except
the resonances at small βs are damped heavily.

As a more realistic example, we consider an APT super-
conducting (SC) 1-cell cavity with a power coupler [2]. Of
course, such a cavity with wide beam pipes to damp higher
order modes can not be described completely by the for-
malism of Sect. 2, except for the modes below the pipe
cutoff. Direct time-domain computations with the codes
MAFIA [3] and ABCI [4] show the existence of only 2
longitudinal modes below the cutoff for the β = 0.64 cav-
ity, and only 1 for β = 0.82, in both cases including the
fundamental mode at f0 = 700 MHz. The loss factor con-
tributions from these lowest resonance modes for a Gaus-
sian bunch with the length l = 3.5 mm for β = 0.64, and
l = 4.5 mm for β = 0.82, are about 1/3 of the total loss
factor.

We use MAFIA results for the ﬁeld of the lowest mode
to calculate the overlap integral and study the loss factor
dependence on β. The on-axis longitudinal ﬁeld of the
fundamental mode is ﬁtted very well by a simple formula
(z/a)2], where a = 0.079 m for
Ez(z) = Ez(0) exp [
β = 0.64 and a = 0.10 m for β = 0.82, see [5] for detail.
The ratio of the shunt impedances in Eq. (5) is then easy to
get analytically

where ω = 2πf0. The resulting dependence shows a
smooth decrease at lower βs. The loss factor for the lowest
mode for β = 0.64 is 0.614 times that with β
1, and for
β = 0.82 is 0.768 times the corresponding β = 1 result.

3.3 APT Cavity, 5 cells

For 5-cell APT SC cavities the lowest resonances are split
into 5 modes which differ by phase advance per cell ∆Φ,
and their frequencies are a few percent apart [2]. We use
MAFIA results [6] for these modes to calculate their loss
factors according to Eq. (4). The on-axis ﬁelds of two
modes, with ∆Φ = 0 (0-mode) and ∆Φ = π (π-mode),
which is the cavity accelerating mode, are shown in Fig. 2.
Time-domain simulations with the code ABCI [4] give
us the loss factor of a bunch at β = 1. The loss factor
spectrum for the β = 0.64 cavity, integrated up to a given
frequency, has two sharp steps: one near 700 MHz with
the height 0.5 V/pC and the other near 1400 MHz with the
height about 0.1 V/pC. They correspond to the two bands
of the trapped monopole modes in the cavity, cf. Table 1.

We calculate numerically overlapping integrals in Eq. (4)
for a given β. The results for the loss factors of the lowest
monopole modes are presented in Table 1. The totals for
the TM010 and TM020 bands for β = 1 in Table 1 agree
very well with the time-domain results.
In fact, we are
mostly concerned about only these two resonance bands,
since the higher modes are above the cutoff, and they prop-
agate out of the cavity into the beam pipes depositing most
of their energy there. Our results for the design values of β
are in agreement with those obtained in [2]. Remarkably,

the total loss factors for a given resonance band in Table 1
are lower for the design β than at β = 1. The only ex-
ception is the TM020 band for the β = 0.82 cavity, but it
includes some propagating modes, and its contribution is
very small.

The β-dependence of the loss factor for two TM010
modes mentioned above (0- and π-mode) is shown in Fig.
3. Obviously, the shunt impedance (and the loss factor)
dependence on β is strongly inﬂuenced by the mode ﬁeld
pattern.

4 SUMMARY

→

The examples above compare loss factors for β < 1 with
1 results. More details can be found in [5]. Essen-
β
tially, the frequency-domain approach has been applied in-
stead of the time-domain one. It can be done only when we
know the ﬁelds of all modes contributing signiﬁcantly into
the loss factor. Nevertheless, for many practical applica-
tions, including SC cavities, the lowest mode contribution
is a major concern, because propagating modes travel out
of the cavity and deposit their energy away from the struc-
ture cold parts.

One interesting observation is that the loss factor of an
individual mode at some β < 1 can be many times larger
than for β = 1. Obviously, one should exercise caution in
using β = 1 results as upper estimates for a β < 1 case.

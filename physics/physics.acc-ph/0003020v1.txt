Abstract

An asynchronous accelerator is described, in which the principle
of its operation permits the active longitudinal bunch compression of
accelerated proton beams, to overcome the space charge limitation ef-
fects of intense bunches. It is shown that accelerated bunches from
an RFQ linac can be adapted for Asynchronac injection for a mul-
tiple of choices in the acceleration frequencies of the RFQ and the
Asynchronac. The oﬀered new type of accelerator system is especially
suitable to accelerate proton beams for up to 100M eV energy and
hundreds of mA average current.

1 Introduction

According to its principle of operation, the asynchronous accelerator (Asyn-
chronac) can be viewed to be a machine in between the following two cases.
The Asynchronac can be viewed as a linear accelerator wrapped into a spiral,
in which the harmonic number of the acceleration voltage and the equilibrium
phase of a bunch relative to the acceleration ﬁeld can be changed indepen-
dently. Also, it can be viewed as a separate orbit cyclotron (SOC) [1][2][3]
and an asynchronous cyclotron, which has been described earlier [4][5].

1

It is simpler to present the concept of the Asynchronac as a modiﬁcation
of the parameters and the operating mode of a separate orbit cyclotron,
without changing its structure (see F igure1). If R, the radius and f , the
acceleration voltage frequency in a SOC are selected to be large, such that
q, the harmonic number between acceleration cavities is a large integer at
injection:

q =

h
Nc

=

2πRfrf

NcV

(1)

(where, Nc is the number of resonators in a cyclotron stage and V is
the speed of particles), q would decrease during acceleration as the speed of
particles increased, presenting the following possibilities.

First, it is possible to restrict the increase of radii from injection to ejec-
tion orbits, by not limiting the increase of the average radius of the machine.
Second, it becomes possible to reduce the strength of the bending magnetic
ﬁelds without restrictions. Third, it is possible to increase the length of
drift spaces between bending magnets. And fourth, it becomes possible to
independently set the RF equilibrium phase during the acceleration process.
Thus, the creation of non-isochronous or asynchronous mode of SOC op-
eration is provided by having the inter-cavity harmonic number, q discretely
change on integer values as the beam transits through the sectors and turns.
By modifying the magnetic path length in the sectors the hopping of integer
q values is accomplished. These are the modiﬁcations of the parameters and
the operating mode of a separate orbit cyclotron, which convert it to become
an Asynchronac, with additional new useful qualities. One such important
quality is now the ability to axially compress and thus to monochromatize
the accelerated proton or ion beam bunches.

Only at low energies rapid changes occur in the speed of particles. Be-
cause it is now possible to hop over integer values of q in a reasonably sized
accelerator radius, the Asynchronac concept can best be applied at energies
below 100 MeV , to produce average beam currents in the hundreds of mA.
Such accelerators, in addition to their stand-alone use for speciﬁc applica-
tions, can be more useful as the initial injector stage for the production of
intense bunches, which are injected into higher energy proton accelerators,
such as synchrotrons, linacs or cyclotrons, to produce high and super-high
energy intense beams.

In the present study a valuable implementation of the Asynchronac con-
cept is based on the multiple use of modern RFQ linacs (generating large
currents at small energy spread) [6].

2 Conditions to creat bunch compression in

the asynchronac

The creation of bunch compression in an Asynchronac is made possible by the
inherently available independent setting of the RF acceleration equilibrium
phase, from one resonator to another. In this case, the continuous diﬀerential
equation for synchrotron oscillations does not apply. Consequently, the value
of the equilibrium phase in each resonator is determined by the expression:

cos ϕe =

2∆Es ± ∆Er
2UnTz sin Ψ

(2)

In equation (2) ϕe is the acceleration phase for the synchronous particle in
a bunch and ∆Es is the half width of the natural energy spread of particles,
induced in a bunch, ∆Er is the full width of the desired energy spread to be
induced in a bunch as it passes through the periodic resonators.

In an injected bunch, a particle having a higher energy than the energy of
the synchronous particle is found normally at the head of the bunch and those
having lower energy than the central one are normally at the tail. For this
normal case, ∆Er is used with the plus sign in equation (2). However, for the
reverse situation where particles having higher energy than the synchronous
particle appear at the tail of the bunch, ∆Er in equation (2) is used with the
minus sign.

Un is the amplitude of the acceleration voltage in the n-th resonator.
Using electrical and mechanical methods to regulate each cavity channel, the
details of which will be described in a separate paper, the acceleration ﬁeld
in any n-th sector resonator’s particle orbit channel can be independently
tuned. In equation (2) 2Ψ is the full phase width of a bunch and Tz is the
transit-time factor determined by

3

where,

T =

sin ∆Φ/2

∆Φ/2

∆Φ =

2πfrf Lgap

βc

(3)

(4)

ff r is the frequency of the acceleration ﬁeld in resonators, Lgap is the full
acceleration gap in resonators, β is the relativistic velocity factor, c is the
speed of light. Normally Tz can be maintained at a constant value if the
acceleration gap in a resonator is increased in proportion to the speed of the
accelerated beam, which in turn reduces the need to increase the amplitude
of the acceleration voltage Un.

The energy gain of a central particle in the bunch ∆Ee after exiting a

resonator, is given by

∆Ee = UnTz sin ϕe

(5)

The energy gain for an edge particle, a, located at the head of the bunch

and an edge particle, b, located at the tail of the bunch are determined by

∆Ea = UnTz sin(ϕ − Ψ)

∆Eb = UnTz sin(ϕ + Ψ)

The equilibrium phase for acceleration is set within the limits of

0 < ϕe < (

π
2 − Ψ)

(6)

(7)

(8)

so that the phase of oﬀ-center particles always remains below π/2, and a

Gaussian bunch distribution is maintained.

The bunch duration τf at the end of any sector (at the space located

between two adjacent resonators) is given by

τf = τs + ∆τ

∆τ =

Ss
c

(

1
βb −

1
βa

)

4

(9)

(10)

where τ = ΨT /π, Ss is the orbital path length of particles in the sector

and T is the RF period duration.

In equation (10) if a positive sign is obtained for ∆τ , which is when βa >
βb, this describes bunch elongation and an increase in τf , and if a negative
sign is obtained, it describes axial bunch compression, with a corresponding
decrease in the value of τf .

The last case is possible only for the reverse particle conﬁguration, which
is when βa < βb. Here the normal positioning of particles in a bunch is
altered. The particles a, at the head of a bunch, now have smaller energy
with respect to particles at the center and the tail, a second condition that
supports bunch compression to occur.

If in equation (9) a negative sign is obtained for τf , it means that over-
compression has occurred, after which the normal distribution of particles in
a bunch will be restored.

If in a bunch, conditions are found by the proper selection of the equilib-
rium phase to constantly support the reverse particle distribution, the bunch
duration will constantly decrease and overcome the space charge eﬀect, which
drives the elongation and transverse expansion of the bunch.

From equation (10) it is evident that to obtain large and negative values
of ∆τ it is necessary to have large sector path lengths, Ss and a large negative
diﬀerence in the reciprocals of β. These are the third and fourth conditions
to achieve bunch compression in the Asynchronac.

The values of beam injection energy Ei, initial energy spread ∆Es,i, in-
jected beam emittance, bunch duration τs,i, the injection radius Ri, the num-
ber of acceleration cavities Nc, the amplitude of acceleration voltage Un and
the RF frequency frf , are selected during the conceptual design of the acceler-
ator, based on various technical feasibility considerations. These parameters
must ϕe selected beforehand, based on the simultaneous solution of equations
(9), (10), (5) and (2), to determine the required value of the acceleration equi-
librium phase ϕe, so that it produces bunch compression in a given sector
and a speciﬁc orbital turn.

However, the analytical solutions of the combined equations appear suf-
ﬁciently cumbersome. Consequently, these cannot be reproduced here, but
are found in the computer codes for the calculation and optimization of these
parameters.

5

The control algorithm for the steering of bunches from one sector to
the other in the Asynchronac is as follows. As a function of the measured
energy spread ∆Es,i of the injected beam, the duration of bunches τi, the
design value of the mean path length of the beam in the ﬁrst sector Ss1 and
the selected RF acceleration voltage in the ﬁrst resonator, the RF phase is
set, such that an equilibrium phase ϕe is produced on the rising side of the
acceleration voltage, which after the passage of a bunch in the ﬁrst resonator
will cause at once the inversion of particles to occur.

Also, this particle inversion must be suﬃciently intense, to reduce the
duration of bunches τf 1 close to zero at the end of the beam orbit in the
ﬁrst sector. Thus, there are two cases, one which conserves the inverted
distribution, and the other which induces over-compression and then restores
the normal distribution of particles in a bunch.

For the ﬁrst case, to obtain a monoenergetic beam in the follow-on second
sector, it is necessary to adjust the path length of particles in the ﬁrst sector
Ss1 and to set the equilibrium phase in the second resonator, so that the
acceleration takes place on the falling side of the RF ﬁeld. For the second
case, the rising side of the RF voltage is used to obtain a beam of zero energy
spread. In this case ∆Es in equation (2) takes on a negative sign and ∆Er is
set to zero. In the desired case of preserving inverse distribution of particles,
it is necessary to work only on the rising side of the RF acceleration ﬁeld.
The choices are determined by the magnitude of ∆Es.

Hence, at the start of the second sector the beam will be monoenergetic
and have a bunch length equal to τf 1, and at the end of the sector the bunch
duration τf 2 will increase due to the space charge eﬀect. At the same time
this provides the possibility to estimate the eﬀect experimentally.

The equilibrium phase at the third resonator must be set such that the
acceleration occurs again on the rising side of the RF voltage, to obtain an
inverse particle distribution in bunches, so that at the end of the third sector
the bunch duration τf 3 reduces again to almost zero. Thus, the process
repeats itself, with and without alternating the acceleration mode on the
rising and falling side of the RF voltage. For a more graphic presentation
the numerical modeling in the following section is provided.

The path length of particles in sectors is set by the parameters of the
bending magnetic system, which essentially must change from sector to sec-
tor, to provide the desired values of q and ϕe. To have the possibility of

6

precise tuning and to relieve the maintenance of diﬀerent mechanical tol-
erances of the accelerator components and their alignment, we propose to
place in the sectors diﬀerent correction elements. This is in addition to the
magnetic lenses for transverse focusing of the beam and a number of beam
monitors. In particular, wiggler type magnets will be installed in the straight
sections to correct the path length of particles. Finally, evaluations show that
in having large beam orbit separation steps and in the other features of the
Asynchronac, the mechanical tolerances of accelerator elements and their
alignment are relatively relaxed, in the order of 10−3.

The important relaxation of tolerances in the Asynchronac is one of
its main advantages, in comparison to other similar accelerator structures,
namely, as compared with the isochronous separate orbit cyclotrons [1][2]. In
these the necessity of strictly maintaining the isochronism of particle motion
reduces to having tight tolerances, which in practice are diﬃcult to imple-
ment. Other important advantages are due to the features of longitudinal
bunch compression and strong transverse focusing. As such, it is possible
to consider the acceleration of bunches at an equilibrium phase close to 900,
which in turn, increases the eﬃciency of acceleration, decreases the number
of turns, decreases the beam losses, and increases the number of accelerated
particles in bunches.

Basically, the Asynchronac’s deﬁciency is the uniqueness or unprece-
dented nature of the sector bending magnetic system. This complicates the
standardization of their manufacture and tuning, and somewhat increases the
initial commissioning time and manufacturing cost of the accelerator. How-
ever, some technical innovations already made, essentially facilitate the solu-
tion of these problems. This concern, the fabrication of magnet yokes from
iron sheets with the ability to mechanically change the magnetic lengths and
the remote control of the magnetic alignment in each sector and turn. The
individual feeding of the DC bending magnets and partially the magnetic fo-
cusing lenses is straightforward to implement, using modern electronics and
computers.

The issues of beam transverse focusing in this study are not considered,
since known standard solutions can be utilized, as normally found in strong
focusing synchrotrons. In particular, the separate function periodic magnetic
structure can be of the FODO type. In the Asynchronac the main diﬀerence
will be the possibility of having a slowly changing betatron oscillation fre-

7

quency, in going from one period to another. This will allow to compensate
the frequency shift of these oscillations, which is due to diﬀerent eﬀects,
including the space charge eﬀect.

3 Conﬁguring RFQ beams for injection into

cyclotron

The method of forming short duration bunches from modern high frequency
RFQ’s, which produce large current and small energy spread beams, can be
modiﬁed to produce longer duration bunches at longer inter-bunch spacing,
that becomes acceptable for injection in the lower frequency Asynchronac.
This technique is based on time compressing the RFQ-produced beam, in
which the compression is completed downsteam, at the point of injection
into the Asynchronac, as described in F igure2(a). F igure2(b) shows the
resulting single longer bunch produced from a train of shorter RFQ-produced
bunches.

Our proposed scheme to produce the required beam compression is as
follows. RFQ-produced bunches are initially steering in a RF deﬂector with
a saw-tooth time varying voltage. The saw-tooth period is equal to the period
of the Asynchronac’s driving RF frequency. The sequentially more and more
deﬂected bunches pass through a 1800 shaping magnet with diﬀerent path
lengths, as seen in F igure2(a). After which all RFQ bunches within the saw-
tooth period coincide at the time focal point, producing full compression of
the bunch train into a single longer bunch, at the injection point of the
Asynchronac. The RF deﬂector and the injection point of the Asynchronac
are located at conjugate points about the 1800 shaping magnet.

If the duration of the short bunches in a RFQ is designated by τRF Q and
the period between RFQ bunches is TRF Q, the time-compression of the bunch
train produces a single longer bunch τcyc for injection into the Asynchronac,
given by

where the period between injected bunches will be

τcyc = mτRF G

Tcyc = mTRF G

8

(11)

(12)

in which m is the number of RFQ bunches in a train length equal to the

period of the driving saw-tooth ramped voltage.

The path length of any k-th bunch in the train, starting from the RF
deﬂector up the time-focused injection point of all the idealized paths, is
obtained by

Lk = 2[

+ R(1 − cos αk +

2 − αk) − atgαk + b]

under the conditions of

(13)

(14)

(17)

(18)

R ≥ (atgαmax) and b ≤ (R cos αmax)

The signiﬁcance of the quantities R, a, b, α are exhibited in the geometry

of F igure2(a).

The maximum path length of particles will be

Lmax = 2[a + b + (

πR
2

)]

while the minimum path length is

Lmin = 2[

a

cos αmax

+ R(

π
2 − αmax)]

(15)

(16)

The separation of maximum and minimum path lengths, under the opti-

mum condition of

will be

R = atgαmax and b = R cos αmax

∆Lmax = 2R[ctgαmax + cos αmax + αmax − co sec αmax]

However, from primary considerations, the separation of maximum and

minimum path lengths is

∆Lmax = βcTcyc

(19)

Knowing the value of ∆Lmax from equation (19) and inverting equation
(18) produces the optimal turning radius Rtr of beam tracks in the time com-
pression shaping magnet, whereby the overall dimensions and the magnetic
ﬁeld strength are obtained. Thus, the optimum bending radius is given by

4 Results of numerical calculations

A numerical example is worked out to present the key performance features
and to indicate a rough cost estimate of the Asychronac. The following pa-
rameters are used in the calculation of the numerical example accelerator
model. The RFQ linac’s RF system operates at 350 MHz, producing a pro-
ton beam of 2.0 MeV energy, an energy spread of ∆Es = 2% and a CW
current of up to 100 mA. The frequency of the acceleration voltage in the
Asynchronac is chosen to be 50 MHz, i.e. to have a seven-fold diﬀerence in
the frequencies of the acceleration ﬁelds, between the RFQ and the Asyn-
chronac. This means that the number of RFQ bunches to be compressed
into a single bunch is m = 7.

However, in our example calculation, in order to be able to use two fun-
neled RFQ’s for injection, we have assumed 14 bunches to be compressed
into a single bunch for injection, and for the maximum steering angle of the
RF deﬂector, αmax = 200 is selected.

Whereby, the following parameter values are obtained
τcyc = 4.0ns Tcyc = 40.0ns ∆Lmax = 78.2cm
R ≈ 35.15cm b ≈ 33.0cm a= 96.6cm
The total maximal path length including the magnetic shaping structure
will be 330 cm, and the track length up to the middle of the ﬁrst resonator
will be approximately 4.4 m. The duration of bunches at the end of the
total path length will increase due to the beam’s energy spread ∆Es, by
approximately 2.2 ns, so that the bunch length in the ﬁrst resonator of the
Asynchronac will be

τcyc = 4.0 + 2.2 = 6.2ns
In the given example of the Asynchronac, operating at a RF acceleration
frequency of 50 MHz, the inter-bunch separation is Tcyc = 20 ns. To match
with this spacing, the use of two RFQ’s will be required, each injecting at
an inter-bunch spacing of 40 ns, which when initially combined in a RFQ
funnel [7], will yield the required 20 ns inter-bunch spacing.

10

Incidentally, the Asynchronac geometry permits further increasing the
number of injector RFQ linacs in a manner analogous to the conventional
method of multi-turn injection. RFQ’s with own bunch-train compressors can
inject beams at each sector of the ﬁrst or subsequent turn. However, each
must have a diﬀerent injected beam energy that matches the orbit’s energy
at the point of injection. Thus, successive RFQ’s must have correspondingly
higher beam energies.

The bunch-train-compressed beam from a RFQ injector, through the 1800
bending magnet enters the Asynchronac’s ﬁrst resonator. F igure 1 schemat-
ically depicts the Asynchronac structure and the beam orbits, only for the
central particles of the ﬁrst three turns. The orbit radius at injection is
Ri = 3.0m, the orbit-to-orbit separation is ∆R = 25cm and the number of
resonators is Nc = 4. The number of sectors is also equal to Ns = 4 per
beam turn, and since the number of turns is 17, the number of independent
channels and magnets is 4 · 17 = 68.

The key design parameters of the Asynchronac for the numerical example
are summarized in T able 1. Room temperature resonators are used in the
design, which increase the machine’s radius. Following the development and
operation of modern cyclotron resonators at the Paul Scherrer Institute [8]
and the related designs and models [9], the operation of these resonators at
RF frequencies of 40 − 50 MHz and peak voltages of up to 1.1 MV can be
made available. These resonators have a length of approximately 6 m, height
of 3 m and width along the beam of 0.3 m, and provide a radial operating
clearance for orbits of up to 4 m.

Thus, an injected bunch duration of 6.2 ns is compressed down to2.5
ns at the end of the ﬁrst sector, using the parameter values of Un = 130
KeV , Tz = 0.95, ϕ = 55.80 and setting the equilibrium phase in the ﬁrst
resonator at ϕe = 18.40. Under these conditions, particles at the head of the
bunch will have energy equal to 2.104 KeV , while at the tail of the bunch,
particle energy will be 1.975 KeV . Particles at the equilibrium phase will
have an energy of 2.039 KeV and the energy spread of the bunch will be
∆Es = 2.104 KeV Next, particle inversion will take place. At the end of the
ﬁrst sector, ∆τ will be 8.9 ns, consequently τf = 6.2−8.9 = −2.7 ns, whereby
the inversion has been completed and over-compression has occurred. The
subsequent processes are easier to observe in F igures 3 − 10, right up to
the achievement of the ﬁnal proton beam energy of approximately 50 MeV ,
which is produced after 16.5 turns in the Asynchronac.

It is observed from the numerical results in these ﬁgures, that the process
of eﬀective longitudinal beam compression has terminated after the ﬁrst three
turns. The duration of bunches has attained an almost stationary value of
about 0.5 ns and the ﬁnal energy spread of the beam ∆Es ends up to be zero
in the Asynchronac.

We now roughly estimate the maximum particle population in a proton

12

bunch, as a function of bunch shortening.
In our simpliﬁed approach we
ignore the intra-beam scattering and wake ﬁeld eﬀects on bunch lengthening
and the axial focusing from the RF acceleration cavities.
In the proton
bunch’s rest frame, the energy spread due to the bunch electric self-ﬁeld is
given by

with σ = 0.7z as the standard value of the bunch length, and inserting

obtained for the maximum particle population in a bunch

Using the parameters in the above, and taking for the beam radius a = 0.5
cm and the vacuum chamber radius b = 5.0 cm, the estimated maximum
number of protons per bunch is N0 ≈ 5 · 1011.

From these ﬁgures it is seen that the magnetic ﬁeld in each sector and
turn has suﬃciently diﬀerent and not necessarily optimized parameters. To
simplify the numerical calculations we assumed that the bending magnets
in each sector and turn consist of single whole units, instead of being a
number of shorter modular magnets that would serve the required purpose.
In making the conceptual design of a speciﬁc Asynchronac, the sector and

13

turn magnets will be modularized with optimized parameters, such that the
diﬀerences among modular magnets will be few, to permit standardizing the
manufacturing process.

Rather low values of 0.1 − 0.85 T esla are required for the magnetic ﬁeld
strength in each sector and turn. The fabrication of small-sized modular
bending magnets at these ﬁeld strengths is a standard matter. Should the
beam’s vacuum chamber need an aperture full width of as much as 10 cm,
this can be easily accommodated, since the turn-to-turn orbit separations will
all be equal at ∆R = 25 cm. The lengths of the remaining free drift spaces
in sectors and turns, after the allocation of resonators and bending magnets,
will be more than 2.0 m. This will allow not only to freely install focusing
magnetic elements and beam monitoring apparatus, but also to provide easily
100% extraction of the beam.

A rough estimation of the cost to build and operate the Asynchronac
shows that the cost per megawatt of proton beam produced from the Asyn-
chronac is much less expensive by an order of magnitude, as compared to
a megawatt of proton beam produced from the high and super-high energy
accelerators.

5 Conclusion

The primary objective of this paper is to show that the innovated acceler-
ator type, which we refer to as the Asynchronac, has suﬃcient feasibility
features for its implementation, in which an accelerated proton beam of up
to 100 MeV energy and hundreds of mA current can be eﬀectively bunch-
compressed. Consequently, it is important to expedite the extension of fur-
ther multifaceted studies on this concept, to improve the quality of future
machines for scientiﬁc and applied applications, potentially using this alter-
native.

Abstract

We present the applications of methods from nonlin-
ear local harmonic analysis for calculations in nonlin-
ear collective dynamics described by different forms of
Vlasov-Maxwell-Poisson equations. Our approach is based
on methods provided the possibility to work with well-
localized in phase space bases, which gives the most sparse
representation for the general type of operators and good
convergence properties. The consideration is based on a
number of anzatzes, which reduce initial problems to a
number of dynamical systems and on variational-wavelet
approach to polynomial/rational approximations for non-
linear dynamics. This approach allows us to construct the
solutions via nonlinear high-localized eigenmodes expan-
sions in the base of compactly supported wavelet bases and
control contribution from each scale of underlying mul-
tiscales. Numerical modelling demonstrates formation of
coherent structures and stable patterns.

INTRODUCTION

In this paper we consider the applications of numerical-
-analytical technique based on the methods of local non-
linear harmonic analysis or wavelet analysis to nonlinear
beam/accelerator physics problems which can be charac-
terized by collective type behaviour and described by some
forms of Vlasov-Maxwell-Poisson equations [1]. Such ap-
proach may be useful in all models in which it is pos-
sible and reasonable to reduce all complicated problems
related with statistical distributions to the problems de-
scribed by systems of nonlinear ordinary/partial differen-
tial equations with or without some (functional)constraints.
Wavelet analysis is a set of mathematical methods, which
gives the possibility to work with well-localized bases in
functional spaces and gives the maximum sparse forms for
the general type of operators (differential, integral, pseu-
dodifferential) in such bases. Our approach is based on
the variational-wavelet approach from [2]-[13], which al-
lows us to consider polynomial and rational type of non-
linearities. The solution has the multiscale/multiresolution
decomposition via nonlinear high-localized eigenmodes,
which corresponds to the full multiresolution expansion in
all underlying time/space scales. The same is correct for
the contribution to power spectral density (energy spec-
trum): we can take into account contributions from each

level/scale of resolution.
In all these models numerical
modelling demonstrates the appearance of coherent high-
localized structures and stable patterns formation. Start-
ing from Vlasov-Maxwell-Poisson equations in part 2, we
consider the approach based on variational-wavelet for-
mulation in part 3. We give the explicit representation
for all dynamical variables in the base of compactly sup-
ported wavelets or nonlinear eigenmodes. Our solutions
are parametrized by solutions of a number of reduced al-
gebraical problems one from which is nonlinear with the
same degree of nonlinearity as initial differential problem
and the others are the linear problems which correspond
to the particular method of calculations inside concrete
wavelet scheme. In part 4 we consider numerical modelling
based on our analytical approach.

EQUATIONS

Analysis based on the non-linear Vlasov-Maxwell-Poi-
sson equations leads to more clear understanding collec-
tive effects and nonlinear beam dynamics of high intensity
beam propagation in periodic-focusing and uniform-focu-
sing transport systems. We consider the following form of
equations (ref. [1] for setup and designation):

3 MULTISCALE REPRESENTATIONS

We obtain our multiscale/multiresolution representations
(formulae (11) below) for solutions of equations (1)-(5)
via variational-wavelet approach for the following formal
systems of equations (with corresponding obvious con-
straints on distribution function),which are the general
form of these equations. Let L be an arbitrary (non) li-
near differential/integral operator with matrix dimension
d, which acts on some set of functions Ψ ≡ Ψ(s, x) =
, s, x ∈ Ω ⊂ Rn+1 from L2(Ω):

Ψ1(s, x), . . . , Ψd(s, x)

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

LΨ ≡ L(R(s, x), s, x)Ψ(s, x) = 0,

(6)

(x are the generalized space coordinates or phase space co-
ordinates, s is “time” coordinate). After some anzatzes
[13],[14] the main reduced problem may be formulated as
the system of ordinary differential equations

dfi
ds

Qi(f )

= Pi(f, s),

f = (f1, ..., fn),

(7)

i = 1, . . . , n, max

deg Pi = p, max

deg Qi = q

i

or a set of such systems corresponding to each indepen-
dent coordinate in phase space. They have the ﬁxed initial
(or boundary) conditions fi(0), where Pi, Qi are not more
than polynomial functions of dynamical variables fj and
have arbitrary dependence on time. As result we have the
following reduced algebraical system of equations on the
set of unknown coefﬁcients λk
i of localized eigenmode ex-
pansion (formula (9) below):

L(Qij, λ, αI ) = M (Pij , λ, βJ ),

(8)

where operators L and M are algebraization of RHS and
LHS of initial problem (7) and λ are unknowns of reduced
system of algebraical equations (RSAE) (8). After solu-
tion of RSAE (8) we determine the coefﬁcients of wavelet
expansion and therefore obtain the solution of our initial
problem. It should be noted if we consider only truncated
expansion with N terms then we have from (8) the system
of N × n algebraical equations with degree ℓ = max{p, q}
and the degree of this algebraical system coincides with de-
gree of initial differential system. So, we have the solution
of the initial nonlinear (rational) problem in the form

fi(s) = fi(0) +

λk
i fk(s),

(9)

N

Xk=1

where coefﬁcients λk
i are the roots of the corresponding re-
duced algebraical (polynomial) problem RSAE (8). Con-
sequently, we have a parametrization of solution of ini-
tial problem by the solution of reduced algebraical prob-
lem (8). The obtained solutions are given in the form (9),
where fk(t) are basis functions obtained via multiresolu-
tion expansions and represented by some compactly sup-
ported wavelets. Because afﬁne group of translation and
dilations is inside the approach, this method resembles the

action of a microscope. We have contribution to ﬁnal result
from each scale of resolution from the whole inﬁnite scale
of spaces. More exactly, the closed subspace Vj (j ∈ Z)
corresponds to level j of resolution, or to scale j. We con-
sider a multiresolution analysis of L2(Rn) (of course, we
may consider any different functional space) which is a se-
quence of increasing closed subspaces Vj:

...V−2 ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ ...

satisfying the following properties: let Wj be the orthonor-
mal complement of Vj with respect to Vj+1 : Vj+1 =
Vj

Wj, then

L

L2(R) = V0

Wj ,

(10)

Mj=0

As a result the solution of equations (1)-(5) has the fol-
lowing multiscale/multiresolution decomposition via non-
linear high-localized eigenmodes

Ψ(s, x) =

aij U i(x)V j(s),

which corresponds to the full multiresolution expansion
in all underlying time/space scales. Formula (11) gives
us expansion into the slow part Ψslow
N,M and fast oscillating
parts for arbitrary N, M. So, we may move from coarse
scales of resolution to the ﬁnest one for obtaining more de-
tailed information about our dynamical process. The ﬁrst
terms in the RHS of formulae (11) correspond on the global
level of function space decomposition to resolution space
and the second ones to detail space. In this way we give
contribution to our full solution from each scale of resolu-
tion or each time/space scale or from each nonlinear eigen-
mode. This functional space decomposition corresponds to
exact nonlinear eigenmode decompositions. It should be
noted that such representations give the best possible local-
ization properties in the corresponding (phase)space/time
coordinates. In contrast with different approaches formu-
lae (11) do not use perturbation technique or linearization
procedures and represent dynamics via generalized nonlin-
ear localized eigenmodes expansion. So, by using wavelet
bases with their good (phase) space/time localization prop-
erties we can construct high-localized coherent structures
in spatially-extended stochastic systems with collective be-
haviour.

4 MODELLING

Multiresolution/multiscale representations for the so-
lutions of equations from part 2 in the high-localized
bases/eigenmodes are demonstrated on Fig. 1–Fig. 3. This

modelling demonstrates the appearance of stable patterns
formation from high-localized coherent structures. On
Fig. 1 we present contribution to the full expansion from
level 1 of decomposition (11). Fig. 2, 3 show the rep-
resentations for full solutions, constructed from the ﬁrst 6
eigenmodes (6 levels in formula (11)). Figures 2, 3 show
stable pattern formation based on high-localized coherent
structures.

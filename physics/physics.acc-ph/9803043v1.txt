Abstract

An approach has been developed where the Smith-Purcell radi-
ation (SPR), i.e.
emission of electrons moving close to a periodic
structure, is treated as the resonant diﬀraction radiation. Simple for-
mulas have been designed for the SPR intensity for a grating having
perfectly conducting strips spaced by a vacuum gap. The results have
been compared with those obtained via other techniques. It has been
shown that the intensity of radiation for the said gratings for a rela-
tivistic case suﬃciently exceeds the SPR intensity for the grating made
up by a periodically deformed continuous surface.

Radiation of electrons passing in the vicinity of a periodic structure made
of some conducting material, the so-called Smith-Purcell eﬀect (SPE), has
been studied by both experimental and theoretical scholars for over 40 years
now since its discovery. Nonetheless, only the recent years saw the ﬁrst
experiments using relativistic beams [1-3]. Design and realization of such
experiments followed by comparison with numerical calculations (see e.g.
Refs.4 and 5) is retarded due to the absence of a simple physical model
capable of accounting for the emission characteristics in terms of periodic
structure parameters. Within the current approach [6,7], based on the scalar
diﬀraction theory, the complexity of numerical calculations, resulting from a
merely optical problem of the grating reﬂectivity on the whole, ”overshad-
ows” the physical mechanism of SPE. We believe that the technique proposed
by M.Moran [8] is deemed more eﬃcient. The author considers SPE for a
stack of semi-inﬁnite foils located normal to the beam trajectory using the ra-
diation characteristics on each of the foil and taking into account interference
from all the stack.

The present paper oﬀers a more feasible model treating SPE as the reso-
nant diﬀraction radiation (RDR) of a relativistic particle on a set of strips of
a ﬁnite width. Fig.1 shows two diﬀerent geometries of the strip arrangement:
parallel (case a) and perpendicular (case b).

Characteristics of the diﬀraction radiation (DR) of the

motion of a charged particle close to a perfectly conducting semi-plane were
derived in Ref.9 by solving the Maxwell equations via the Wiener-Hopf
method. Following the latter formalism [9], one may write the spectral-
angular density of DR (neglecting the terms of the γ−2 order, γ being the
Lorentz factor) as:

which can be connected with the intensity of virtual photons scattered
by the only edge of the semi-plane (the ﬁeld strength of the virtual photons

It can be shown that, with electrons moving parallel to the strip surface,
DR is formed during scattering of the virtual ﬁeld on the edges of the strip,

The interference of DR from a grating consisting of N structural ele-
ments (RDR) is described in an entirely the same fashion as is the resonant
transition radiation [11]:

The phase ϕ in Eq. (12) is controlled solely by the grating period d but

not its structure:

For a considerably large number of elements, N >> 1, we may use a

simpler formula [10]:

The above expression (15) is derived from general considerations irrespec-

tive of any particular radiation mechanism.

The expressions similar to Eq.(15) determine the position of lines in the
spectrum radiated not only for SPE but also for RTR and parametric X-ray
radiation [7,11,12].

Proceeding from Eqs.(4), (11) and (14), upon integration with respect
to frequency we may obtain the angular distribution of the SP radiation
calculated per unit cell of the grating.

Consider ﬁrst the case 1a). As follows from Eq.(5), the maximum yield
is attained for the ϕ|| = π, where from follows the relation between the strip
width and the period:

In Ref.6 a similar problem was solved via a diﬀerent technique, the re-
sulting Eq.(17), however, was rather close to the one in Ref.6, where instead
of a two the numerator has the factor (1+cos θ).

(cid:17)

Fig.2a shows the calculations for the following conditions: γ = 100; d =

6mm; h = 15mm; ξ = 0.

For the 1b) geometry the SPR angular distribution under the same con-

ditions acquires a somewhat more complicated form:

The last term in Eq.(19) has a periodic character with the period be-
ing ∆ϕ⊥ = π. Therefore the distribution Eq.(19) would have dips for the
outgoing angles, when sin2ϕ⊥ becomes zero:

Using Eq.(2) and (11) we may now arrive at an azimuthal dependence of

It is obvious that in the case where sin2 ϕ⊥ << ϕ2

has only one maximum at ξ = 0. Fig.3 presents the calculations for both
geometries. In the relativistic case one can always choose the geometry and
the grating parameters such that the radiation would be concentrated near
the plane normal to the grating. As a result, ﬁrst, the radiation brightness
dW/dΩ increases and, second, conﬁguration of the would-be resonators and
mirrors is simpliﬁed to an advantage as compared to that proposed in Ref.13,
which may turn out quite useful assuming the construction of an SPE - based
free electron laser.

The following should be noted in conclusion. All the experiments on
SPE studies of which the author is aware have been performed with volume
gratings, i.e. when a beam of virtual photons is reﬂected from a continuous
surface deformed via a certain periodic law. For instance, in the case of
a lamellar grating each unit cell of the latter contains two perpendicular
and two parallel planes. Due to destructive interference the reﬂectivity F
of the grating element ( |R−1|2 in terms of Ref.4) is suﬃciently below unity
(10−2 ÷ 10−3, while for a grating of parallel strips separated by vacuum gaps,
this quantity may reach a value of 4 (see Eq.(5)) and, therefore, the SPR
intensity would grow in the same fashion (increasing by 2-3 orders).

In the relativistic case the thickness is chosen such that γλ >> b at
least in the infrared and millimeter range, where polished aluminum could
be considered as an ideal conductor.

Thus, for our case the model proposed is going to be suﬃciently valid.
The deduction made by the authors of Ref.4 on the absence of advantages
for the relativistic beams to be used as the SPR generators seems to us
premature.

The author greatly appreciates the contribution by

Prof.M.Ikezawa and Dr.Y.Shibata rendered through numerous fruitful discus-
sions and stimulating criticism as well as the possibility of getting acquainted
with their experimental results before publication.

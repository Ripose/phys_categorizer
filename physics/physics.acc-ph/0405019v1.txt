A reformulation of intrabeam scattering theory

BNL Report C-A/AP/No. 150

Abstract

The motivation for the treatment of intrabeam scattering theory
given in this paper was to ﬁnd results which would be convenient
for computing the intrabeam scattering growth rates for particle dis-
tributions which are more complicated than a simple gaussian.
It
was shown by A. Piwinski that beam growth rates due to intrabeam
scattering can be expressed as a multidimensional integral [1]. It was
pointed out by J. Bjorken and S. Mtingwa [2] that the reduction of the
multidimensional integral to a 3-dimensional untegral is made easier
by writing the integral so that its relativistic transformation proper-
ties are more obvious. The starting point in [2] was a result from the
treatment of the two body scattering problem in relativistic quantum
theory . In this paper the starting point is the relativistic transfor-
mation properties of the scattering cross section which may be a more
familiar starting point. The resulting expression for the multidimen-
sional integral is simpler to reduce.
In addition, the results do not
depend on the particular form of the Coulomb cross section that was
used in [2] and are valid for any collision cross section.

1 Introduction

The motivation for the treatment of intrabeam scattering theory given in
this paper was to ﬁnd results which would be convenient for computing the
intrabeam scattering growth rates for particle distributions which are more
complicated than a simple gaussian. It was shown by A. Piwinski that beam

growth rates due to intrabeam scattering can be expressed as a multidimen-
sional integral [1]. It was pointed out by J. Bjorken and S. Mtingwa [2] that
the reduction of the multidimensional integral to a 3-dimensional untegral
is made easier by writing the integral so that its relativistic transformation
properties are more obvious. The starting point in [2] was a result from the
treatment of the two body scattering problem in relativistic quantum theory
. In this paper the starting point is the relativistic transformation properties
of the scattering cross section which may be a more familiar starting point.
The resulting expression for the multidimensional integral is simpler to re-
duce. In addition, the results do not depend on the particular form of the
Coulomb cross section that was used in [2] and are valid for any collision
cross section.The ﬁnal result is given by Eq.(14), which can be used for com-
puting the intrabeam scattering growth rates for particle distributions which
are more complicated than a simple gaussian.

2 Transformation properties of the cross sec-

tion

The cross section, σ, which describes the the scattering of particles with the
momentum p1 from the target particles with momentum p2 is ﬁrst deﬁned
in the CS (coordinate system) where the target particles are at rest, p2 = 0.
In a scattering event, the particle momenta change from p1, p2 to p′
2. As
we are assuming that both momentum and energy are conserved , the ﬁnal
momenta, p′
1 which is indicated
by the unit vector ˆp′
In this CS where p2 = 0, σ is deﬁned so that the
1.
number of incident particles which are scattered by the target particles with
momemtum p2 which are in the volume element, d3x, in the time interval dt,
into the solid angle dΩ′ corresponding to the direction ˆp′

2 are determined by the direction of p′

1 is given by

1, p′

1, p′

δN = σdΩ′ρ1(x)v1ρ2(x)d3xdt

(1)

where ρ1(x), ρ2(x) are the density functions and v1 is the velocity of the
incident particle.

Now let us go to a CS where p2

= 0. In this CS, σ is deﬁned by requiring
σdΩ′ to be invariant, that is to have the same value in all coordinate systems.
A simple way to ﬁnd the relationship between δN and σ in this CS is to write

δN as (see [3])

δN = σdΩ′ ρ1(x)
γ1

ρ2(x)
γ2

F (p1, p2)d3xdt

where ρ1(x)/γ1 is an invariant as it is just the density function for particle 1
in the CS where p1 = 0. Similarly for ρ2(x)/γ2. If one can ﬁnd an invariant
F (p1, p2) which for p2 = 0 gives F = γ1v1, then this expression for δN gives
the correct result when p2 = 0 and also gives the correct result when p2
= 0.
F (p1, p2) that satiﬁes these requirements is

F (p1, p2) = c

Here, p1, p2 are 4-vectors whose ﬁrst three components are the components
of the momemtum and the fourth component is iE/c, E = (p2c2 + m2c4).5.
F (p1, p2) is an invariant and when p2 = 0, F = γ1v1. The result for F (p1, p2)
given by Eq.(3) can also be written as

F (p1, p2) = γ1γ2c[( ~β1

Here, ~β1, ~β2 are vectors in 3-space corresponding to the velocities of the par-
ticles divide by c.

3 The f (x, p) distribution and the scattering

rate δN

Let us now treat the case where the particles are contained within a bunch
and their distibution is given by f (x, p) where Nf (x, p) is the number of
particles in d3xd3p. N is the number of particles in the bunch, all particles
have the same rest mass m and

d3xd3p f (x, p) = 1

Z

Let δN be the number of particles with momentum p1 in d3p1 and space
coordinate x in d3x which are scattered by the particles with momentum p2
in d3p2 which are also in d3x, in the time interval dt , into the solid angle
dΩ′ corresponding to the direction ˆp′
1. Then δN can be obtained using the

3

same procedure used in obtaining Eq.(2), provided one knows that d3p/γ and
f (x, p) are invariants, which is shown in section 5. δN is given by

δN = N 2σdΩ

One may note that the right hand side of this expression for δN is an in-
variant. We will be putting c = 1 except when something may be gained by
showing c explicitly.

4 Growth rates for < pipj >

Growth rates will be given for < pipj >. where the <> indicate an average
over all the particles in the bunch. From these one can compute the growth
rates for the emittances, < ǫi >. The advantage due to computing growth
rates for < pipj > stems from the observation that if pi, pj are the components
of the momentum 4-vector, then pipj is a tensor in 4-space and so is δ <
pipj >, as will be seen below, where δ < pipj > is the change in < pipj >
in a time interval dt. The transfornation properties of a tensor can then be
used to facilitate the transfer of results between two CS.

In a scattering event, where a particle with momentum p1 scatters oﬀ a
particle with momentum p2, the momenta will change to p′
2. Let δp1i
represent the change in p1i in the collision, and similarly for δ(p1ip1j). Then

One may note that

< δ(p1ip1j) >= δ < p1ip1j >

and that δ < p1ip1j > is a tensor in 4-space because of the transformation
properties given above for the quantities appearing on the right hand side of
Eq.(7). Eq.(7) is our general result for the growth rates , holds in all CS,
and can be used for any particle distribution, f (x, p).

This result can be further simpliﬁed by ﬁrst considering the integral, for

a given p1, p2,

Cij =

Z

σdΩ′(p′

1ip′

p1ip1j)

1j −

Cij has the transformation properties of a tensor in 4-space as σdΩ′ is an
invariant. For a given p1, p2, Cij can be evaluated in the CMS ( the center of
mass CS ) and if the result can be written in terms of 4-vectors and tensors
in 4-space, then the result in this form. will hold in all CS. The calculation
of Cij can be simpliﬁed by noting that because of the symmetry in p1 and p2
we have

< δ(p1ip1j) > = < δ(p2ip2j) >

and we can deﬁne Cij as

Cij =

[δ(p1ip1j) + δ(p2ip2j)]

and Eq.(7) can be written as

We will now further evaluate Cij by ﬁrst evaluating Cij for some particular
values of p1,p2 in the CMS corresponding to p1,p2 and and then using the
tensor properties of Cij to ﬁnd a result that holds in any other CS. We are
particularly interested in ﬁnding a result in the Rest CS, which is the CS
which moves along with the bunch. In the CMS,

sured relative to the direction of ~p1 or ~∆ and we assume that σ(θ, φ) is a

To ﬁnd Cij in the Rest CS or in the Lab CS, we will try to ﬁnd an expression

An important further simpliﬁcation results from the fact that the particle
motion is non-relativistic in the CMS and also in the Rest CS which moves
along with the bunch. For RHIC parameters, for γ = 100, one ﬁnds that

Eq.(14) would be a good starting point for computing growth rates for a
particle distribution more complicated than a simple gaussian. For the case

5 Invariants d3p/γ and f (x, p)

In order to eatablish Eq.(5), one needs to know that d3p/γ and f (x, p) are
invariants. Consider a CS moving with the velocity v0 with respect to the
Laboratory CS. Let the coordinates be x, p in the Laboratory CS and ˆx, ˆp in
the new CS. p, ˆp are related by

Thus dps/γ is invariant under this momentum transformation and also d3p/γ
is invariant.

Now let us show that f (x, p) is an invariant. Since f (x, p)d3xd3p is an
invariant, as it gives the number of particles in d3xd3p, we need to show that
d3xd3p is an invariant. Consider the point x, p in some CS. In the moving
CS where ˆps = 0, which is moving with the velocity v = ps/E with respect
to the ﬁrst CS,

−

d ˆps = γ(dps
dE = (ps/E)dps px, pyconstant
d ˆps = dps/γ

Since dps/γ = d ˆps holds for any CS, dps/γ is an invariant and d3p/γ is an
invariant. One also has γd3x is invariant because of the Lorentz-Fitsgerald
contraction. We have then that that d3xd3p is an invariant.

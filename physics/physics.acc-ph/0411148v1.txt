Polarized Proton and Deuteron Beams at COSY

H. Stockhorst for the COSY spin team
Institut f¨ur Kernphysik, Forschungszentrum J¨ulich, Germany

Abstract: Aim of this paper is to present a brief and basic introduction
to polarized beams and the behaviour of a particle’s spin in an electromag-
netic ﬁeld. It is not intended to give a complete presentation of the spin
dynamic theory. Instead the most important features are given without
proof and details not absolutely necessary are left out. Spin depolariz-
ing mechanisms are discussed and the cures against depolarizing especially
during acceleration as utilized at COSY are outlined. A list of references
is given at the end to help the reader to ﬁnd more deep details on spin
dynamic theory [1].

Introduction

The particle spin is an important feature of nuclei and subnuclear parti-
cles. In general, the particle interactions depend to various degrees on their
spin states. It is thus not surprising that the experimentalists demand on
polarized beams at COSY [2] became important rather early. Polarized
proton beams at COSY are now routinely delivered to internal and ex-
ternal experiments since 1996. The polarized beams from the ion source
are pre-accelerated in the cyclotron JULIC [3], injected and accelerated in
COSY without signiﬁcant loss of polarization. Imperfection resonances are
increased in strength by means of vertical orbit distortions, leading to a
complete polarization reversal (spin ﬂip). Intrinsic resonances are overcome
by means of a fast ramping air core quadrupole magnet inducing a rapid
change in tune and therefore preservation of the polarization (tune jump).
The polarization during acceleration is observed utilizing parts of the
former EDDA [4] detector system as polarimeter. Only the fast online po-
larization measurements during the COSY acceleration cycle made possible
by the EDDA setup allows an eﬃcient correction of the up to 16 ﬁrst order
depolarizing resonances encountered.

Polarized deuterons were accelerated for the ﬁrst time early in 2003 and
are also now routinely available for internal and external experiments. Be-
cause of the lack of depolarizing resonances in the COSY energy range,

1

preservation of the polarization is less involved for deuterons as compared
to protons. However, a polarization measurement technique for vector and
tensor polarization has to be developed. Also in this case the EDDA detec-
tor turned out to be the most important and eﬃcient tool to measure the
polarization even in the accelerating ramp of COSY.

Polarized proton beams with intensities above 1010 stored protons with
a degree of polarization of up to 0.80 are now routinely delivered to internal
experiments [5, 6]. For external experiments polarized protons can be slowly
extracted from COSY via stochastic extraction without loss of polarization
by keeping the extraction momentum far enough away from depolarizing res-
onances and careful adjustment of the betatron tunes during the extraction
process.

2.1 Polarization of spin-1/2 particle beams

Along a quantization axis z the spin ~S of a proton can only be found in
two eigenstates of ~Sz with eigenvalues of the spin component Sz = +~/2
~/2 (”down” or ”-” state). The degree of
(”up” or ”+” state) or Sz =
polarization is deﬁned as the ratio

−

P =

N+
N−

N+ + N−

,

(1)

where N± are the number of particles in the two spin states ”up” and
”down”. For a 100% polarized beam (P =
1) the spin states of all particles
are aligned along a polarization axis. In general three parameters are needed
to specify the polarization of spin-1/2 particles. Two for the direction of the
quantization axis and one for the ratio N+
N− . Thus the polarization of a spin-
1/2 particle is a vector characterized by a direction and magnitude. This
type of polarization is therefore called vector polarization. The polarization
of a bunch of particles is found by an ensemble average.

2.2 Polarization of spin-1 particle beams

For a spin-1 system, e.g. deuterons, there are three spin states along a
quantization axis as depicted in ﬁgure 1.

Particles having their spin in a m = 0 state have zero vector polarization
but they are still aligned, i.e. are polarized. Thus the polarization of spin-1
particles is characterized by vector polarization and an alignment. This is
called tensor polarization. The vector polarization is given by the ratio

where N+, N0, N− particles are aligned along the axis with m = 1, 0,
respectively. The tensor polarization is determined from

3 Spin Precession in an Electromagnetic Field

3.1 Non-relativistic particles

For non-relativistic non-radiating particles in a magnetic ﬁeld ~B the spin
motion in the particles’ rest frame is governed by the equation

that gives the time change of the spin as the torque on the magnetic moment
~µ exerted by the magnetic ﬁeld. The magnetic moment ~µ is associated to
the spin by

with the rest mass m0 and the elementary charge e. The gyromagnetic ratio
g is 2 for a point-like spin-1/2 particle. For real particles its deviation from
2)/2. For protons this
2 is expressed by the gyromagnetic anomaly G = (g
value is G = 1.79 and for deuterons G =
0.143. If we insert the magnetic
moment into eq. 4 the equation of motion of the spin vector is found

around the direction of the rotation vector (angular velocity)

which is collinear to the magnetic ﬁeld, see ﬁgure 2. The magnitude of the
rotation vector gives the time rate of change dφ/dt of the angle φ covered

3.2 Relativistic particles

So far we considered a particle at rest. However in COSY particles are
moving with a speed close to the velocity of light and also experience an ac-
celeration when they are bent by the dipole magnets. It turns out that eq. 6
is then still valid albeit with a diﬀerent rotation vector if the electromag-
netic ﬁelds in the laboratory frame are properly Lorentz transformed into
a co-ordinate system that moves with the particle around the ring (moving
frame). If for simplicity the particles move in the horizontal plane they expe-
rience an acceleration that is perpendicular to the velocity and the vertical
magnetic ﬁeld (dipole ﬁelds of COSY). This is the reason of the Thomas
precession which contributes an angular velocity in the moving frame. Thus
the angular velocity ~Ω in eq. 6 will contain two parts, one component results
from the Lorentz transformation and the other one from the Thomas pre-
cession term. The correct form of eq. 6 for moving particle bears the name
from T homas, Bargman, M ichel and T elegdi (T homas
BM T equation)
and is given by

in which the magnetic ﬁeld ~B (see ﬁgure 3) in the laboratory frame has been

The spin precession has the following properties:

An electric ﬁeld E is equivalent to a magnetic ﬁeld B=E/c. An electric
108V/m has the same strength as a magnetic ﬁeld of 1 T. In
ﬁeld of 3
general no such electric ﬁeld is present. In the following electric ﬁelds
are therefore neglected.

Comparison of longitudinal (

According to eq. 8 and 10 the spin vector will rotate in longitudinal
ﬁelds by dφ = ΩBM T dt in the time interval dt. Using ds/dt = βc
we see that the spin rotates by dφ = ΩBM T ds/(βc) while the particle
moves the distance ds. Thus the total spin rotation in a longitudinal
ﬁeld is

determined from

∆φ =

The spin rotation by longitudinal ﬁelds becomes less eﬀective at large
momenta and the spin rotation by transverse ﬁelds becomes nearly
independent of momentum (γG

1).

From eq. 11 and 12 we can directly calculate that

to rotate the spin of 3.3 GeV/c protons around the longitudinal axis
by an angle π a longitudinal ﬁeld with 12.4 Tm is needed at COSY
and for deuterons: 40.3 Tm (!!)

to rotate the proton spin at 3.3 GeV/c in the moving f rame by an
angle π around the vertical axis one needs a vertical magnetic ﬁeld
with
eG = 5.3 T m, and for deuterons

B⊥ds = π m0βc

118 T m.

Thus the deuterons spin is about 20 times harder to manipulate with mag-
netic ﬁelds. On the other hand their spin direction is less sensitive to ﬁeld
errors.

4 Spin Precession and Resonances in a Circular

Particle Accelerator

We ﬁrst consider an ideal accelerator or storage ring in which all components
(dipoles quadrupoles etc.)
lie in the horizontal plane. The particles will
then also move in the horizontal plane on the ideal (circular) path guided
by the vertical dipole ﬁelds. The particle frame rotates with angular velocity
(cyclotron frequency)

~ΩC =

e
m0γ

~B⊥.

The spin will precess around the vertical axis and remains constant in the
straight sections as long as the particle passes the quadrupoles on axis. The
diﬀerence in frequency of spin and velocity precession, eq. 10 and eq. 13,
yields

~Ω = ~ΩBM T

~ΩC = γG~ΩC .

−
The number of spin precession during one turn in the ring follows from eq. 14
and is called spin tune

ν = γG.

From eq. 10 it is clear that the vertical spin component is preserved while the
two other components rotate in the moving frame with the angular frequency
given by eq. 14 around the vertical axis. As the particle completes one
revolution, the coordinate system rotates by 2π and the spin has precessed
around the vertical axis by 2πγG. As a result, in a ring where particles
experience only vertical magnetic ﬁelds the only stable (or invariant) spin
direction is along the vertical axis. The spin rotation around the vertical
axis after one turn in the ring can be expressed by the matrix

0 sin(2πγG)

sin(2πγG) 0 cos(2πγG)









−

Now consider that at one location in the ring there is a static radial
magnetic ﬁeld component (along the x-axis) as shown in ﬁgure 3. When the
particle passes this disturbing magnetic ﬁeld the spin is rotated around the

7

x-axis by an angle ( given by eq. 12). The spin rotation around the x-axis
due to the disturbing ﬁeld is then given by the matrix

(17)

(18)

The total spin rotation matrix for one turn is then given by the product
M of eq. 16 and eq. 17. The stable spin direction outside the disturbing ﬁeld
region can be found by determining the eigenvectors of M with eigenvalue
1, i.e.
solving the equation M~u = ~u. One ﬁnds that the vertical spin
component is:

y =

Sy
1 + tan2(θ/2)/ sin2(πγG)

.

p

∈

Clearly, y = Sy if there is no disturbing ﬁeld, i.e. θ = 0. However polar-
ization along the vertical axis is completely lost if the spin tune equals an
N. One can say that the spin motion is in resonance
integer, ν = γG = k
with the radial magnetic ﬁeld: every time the particle passes the ﬁeld the
spin vector is bent more and more away from the vertical axis until polar-
ization is lost. Resonances of this type are called imperf ection resonances
or integer resonances. They arise e.g. if magnets are slightly misaligned or
if there are vertical orbit distortions. The particles then experience radial
from vertical focussing quadrupoles). Thus it is im-
magnetic ﬁelds (e.g.
possible to operate the accelerator with a polarized beam at energies where
imperfection resonances occur. However they can be crossed with (almost)
no polarization loss during acceleration as is discussed below.

The term ”resonance” might become more clear in another view: Each
time the particle passes the disturbing radial ﬁeld the spin may point in a
diﬀerent direction with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld if the spin tune is not
an integer. One can think of a rotation of the radial magnetic ﬁeld around
the vertical axis with resonance frequency νRΩC. While the spin is rotating
around the vertical axis with spin tune ν (not an integer) it rotates with
νR)ΩC in the frame of the disturbing ﬁeld as shown
frequency δ = (ν
in ﬁgure 4.
If the spin tune is not an integer these rotations are out of
phase and the disturbing eﬀect of the ﬁeld averages out. No polarization
loss occurs.

where ǫ is proportional to the resonance strength. It is clear that the larger
the ﬁeld is the larger the resonance strength will be. Large vertical closed
orbit errors enhances the imperfection resonance strength. The resonance
strength can also be interpreted as the width of the resonance since in the
ǫ, νR + ǫ) the angle of ~Ω with vertical axis is larger then

rotates around the radial direction and on average the vertical component
is zero and the vertical polarization is lost.

betatron oscillations the spin rotation is no longer given by the rotation ma-
trix eq. 16 since the path length during one turn of a particle now depends
on the betatron amplitude and betatron tune Qx. The spin precession is
modulated by the betatron motion and the spin tune has two additional
values which are in the case of COSY γG
2). A horizontal spin
resonance can occur if γG
2) equals an integer. These resonance
are not important (except when there is coupling between the horizontal
and vertical betatron motion) at COSY with its vertically polarized beams
since the horizontal betatron motion is driven by vertical magnetic ﬁelds
of the quadrupoles (see eqs. 9 and 10). In addition to the horizontal beta-
tron motion the particles also execute a vertical betatron motion with beta-
tron tune Qy induced by the radial magnetic ﬁelds of the vertical focussing
quadrupoles. In this case eq. 17 is no longer valid since, besides a possible
static radial magnetic ﬁeld, the spin precession experiences, or is driven by a
force that is evoked by the vertical betatron motion. Similarly, a resonance
occurs if γG
2) equals an integer. These resonances are named
vertical spin resonances or more frequently, intrinsic resonances. Their
strength is proportional to the square root of the vertical beam emittance
(proportional to beam size). Resonances of this type are dangerous in COSY
because they produce a severe polarization loss if they are not avoided or
compensated. As in the case of imperfection resonances the spin resonances
driven by the betatron motion are energy dependent but in addition depend
also on the vertical tune of the machine. Among these resonances there are
higher order resonances as well those that can be excited by the synchrotron
motion of the particles as induced by an rf-cavity (bunched beam). These
cases play however a minor role at COSY and will therefore not be discussed
here. There are also resonances that can be excited by longitudinal mag-
netic ﬁelds (solenoids). For this type of resonance the reader is referred to
the literature.

5 Resonance Crossing

Suppose we are away from a single resonance. Then δ = (ν
If the beam is accelerated linearly through the resonance one can write
ν = νR + αΘ for the linear variation of the tune with azimuth Θ. For the
spin rotation frequency on resonance we have Ω⊥ = ǫΩC which shows that
the change in the spin rotation angle within the ”time” ∆Θ is ∆φ = ǫ∆Θ.
Since the ”time” needed to cross the resonance is ∆Θ = 2ǫ/α the spin
rotation angle changes by ∆φ = 2ǫ2/α during resonance crossing. Thus we

can distinguish two regimes:

•

•

Fast crossing (∆φ
1) means either a small resonance strength or
a large crossing speed. There is no time to bent away the spin ~S from
the vertical and polarization is conserved.

≪

≫

Slow crossing (∆φ
1) means either a large resonance strength or
a slow crossing speed. The spin vector rotates much faster around the
rotation vector ~Ω than the latter moves. The spin vector ~S follows the
motion of ~Ω and is completely reversed. The polarization has changed
its sign but there is no depolarization (adiabatic spin f lip).

Between these two cases polarization may be completely lost. A quan-
titative estimate of the ﬁnal vertical spin component Sy compared to the
initial value before crossing the resonance is given by the Froissart-Stora
formula

6 Polarized Proton and Deuteron Beams at COSY

6.1 Proton beams

·

At COSY vertically polarized proton beams are available in the momentum
range up to 3650 MeV/c for internal and external experiments. At ﬂat
1010 protons with a polarization of more than 80% can be
top about 1.0
achieved. During acceleration to ﬂat top energy up to sixteen depolarizing
resonances have to be cured for polarized protons. The following graphics
shows the imperfection and intrinsic resonances in the momentum range of
COSY. In this ﬁgure the imperfection resonances appear as horizontal lines
since they are independent of tune. The horizontal axis is the fractional
vertical tune qy (Qy=integer part + qy, for COSY the integer part always
equals 3).

function of the vertical fractional tune. Bold: imperfection resonances, semi-bold:
intrinsic resonances. The shaded zigzag line at qy = 0.62 symbolizes the change in
working point (not in scale) during acceleration of the beam (tune jump).

There are six imperfection resonances. A loss of polarization at these
resonances is avoided by artiﬁcially increasing the resonance strength, such
that the polarization direction is completely reversed (adiabatic spin ﬂip,
slow crossing) when protons are accelerated across the resonance. A vertical
correction dipole located at a position with a large vertical beta-function is
used to increase the orbit distortion that enhances the resonance strength.
One method to conserve polarization at up to ten intrinsic resonances is a
rapid vertical tune change (fast crossing). For this a fast tune jump system
consisting of one air coil quadrupole with a length of 0.6 m and a gradient
of 0.43 T/m is installed in one arc of COSY. It allows a rapid tune change

12

g
of about 0.06 within 10 µs. Double crossing of resonances is avoided by a
slow fall time of 40 ms. Polarization and particle losses due to an emittance
increase can be kept low during acceleration if the beam position is carefully
aligned in the acceleration ramp. In addition electron cooling at injection
energy of COSY has been successfully applied to reduce the beam emittances
in the transverse as well as in the longitudinal phase space. This increases
not only the fast crossing (chapter 5) by reducing the resonance strength but
also lowers beam losses visibile in ﬁgure 5 caused by the fast tune jumps. At
injection the vertical tune is below 3.66. Therefore it is ﬁxed close to 3.62
during acceleration in order to have enough time for consecutive tune jumps
(ﬁgure 6). The dynamic tune measurement allows adjusting the tune during
acceleration as well as the time and amplitude of the tune jumps. Figure 7
shows online measurements of the vertical steerer and fast quadrupole cur-
rents in comparison with the beam current (BCT). The beam is accelerated
in 2.6 s from injection, 0.294 GeV/c, up to 3.1 GeV/c. Particle losses due to
the steerer and fast quadrupole actions are less than 10%. Electron cooling

On-line polarization measurements are carried out during acceleration
with the high precision detector EDDA, designed to measure pp-scattering
excitation functions during the acceleration of the COSY beam. This de-
tector is a double layered scintillation hodoscope and in conjunction with a
CH2 or C ﬁber target well suited to function as a polarimeter. The great ad-
vantage of this online measurement is that the behavior of the polarization
at every resonance is clearly visible in only a few ten minutes, depending on
the desired measurement statistics.

6.2 Deuteron beams

As was pointed out in chapter 3.2 the deuterons spin is about 20 times
harder to manipulate with magnetic ﬁelds. Due to the deuterons G factor
the lowest imperfection resonance that can occur is γG = 7 corresponding

14

to a momentum p = 13 GeV/c which is well above COSYs working range.
Furthermore there are no intrinsic resonances at COSY in the normal tune
range 3.5 < Qy < 3.65. Stochastic extraction to the experiment GEM [7] of a
tensor and vector polarized deuteron beam at 2.4 GeV/c ﬂat top momentum
has been carried out successfully.

Abstract

∼

General guidelines for constructing a quantum theory of charged-particle
beam optics starting ab initio from the basic equations of quantum mechanics,
appropriate to the situation under study. In the context of spin- 1
2 particles,
these guidelines are used starting with the Dirac equation. The spinor the-
ory just constructed is used to obtain the transfer maps for normal and skew
magnetic quadrupoles respectively. As expected the traditional transfer maps
get modiﬁed by the quantum contributions. The classical limit of the quan-
tum formalism presented, reproduces the well-known Lie algebraic formalism
of charged-particle beam optics.

1 Introduction and Formalism

Charged-particle beam optics, or the theory of transport of charged-particle beams
through electromagnetic systems, is traditionally dealt with using classical mechanics.
This is the case in ion optics, electron microscopy, accelerator physics etc [1]-[4] The
classical treatment of charged-particle beam optics has been extremely successful, in
the designing and working of numerous optical devices from electron microscopes to
very large particle accelerators. It is natural to look for a prescription based on the
quantum theory, since any physical system is quantum at the fundamental level! Such
a prescription is sure to explain the grand success of the classical theories and may
also help towards a deeper understanding and designing of certain charged-particle
beam devices. To date the curiosity to justify the success of the classical theories as
a limit of a quantum theory has been the main motivation to look for a quantum
prescription. But, with ever increasing demand for higher luminosities and the need
for polarized beam accelerators in basic physics, we strongly believe that the quantum
theories, which up till now were an isolated academic curiosity will have a signiﬁcant
role to play in designing and working of such devices.

It is historically very curious that the, quantum approaches to the charged-particle
beam optics have been very modest and have a very brief history as pointed out in the
third volume of the three-volume encyclopaedic text book of Hawkes and Kasper [5].
In the context of accelerator physics the grand success of the classical theories origi-
nates from the fact that the de Broglie wavelength of the (high energy) beam particle
is very small compared to the typical apertures of the cavities in accelerators. This
and related details have been pointed out in the recent article of Chen [6].

A beginning of a quantum formalism starting ab initio with the Dirac equation
was made only recently [7]-[8]. The formalism of Jagannathanet al was the ﬁrst one
to use the Dirac equation to derive the focusing theory of electron lenses, in particular
for magnetic and electrostatic axially symmetric and quadrupole lenses respectively.
The formalism of Jagannathan et al further outlined the recipe to obtain a quantum
theory of aberrations. Details of these and some of the related developments in the
quantum theory of charged-particle beam optics can be found in the references [7]-[14].
I shall brieﬂy state the central theme of the quantum formalism with some of the
more recent results relevant to accelerator optics.

The starting point to obtain a quantum prescription is to build a theory based on
the basic equations of quantum mechanics appropriate to the situation under study.
For situations when either there is no spin or spinor eﬀects are believed to be small
and ignorable we start with the scalar Klein-Gordon and Schr¨odinger equations for
relativistic and nonrelativistic cases respectively. For electrons, protons and other
spin- 1
2 particles it is natural to start with the Dirac equation, the equation for spin- 1
2
particles. In practice we do not have to care about the other (higher spin) equations.
In many situations the electromagnetic ﬁelds are static or can reasonably assumed
to be static. In many such devices one can further ignore the times of ﬂights which
are negligible or of not direct interest as the emphasis is more on the proﬁles of
the trajectories. The idea is to analyze the evolution of the beam parameters of
the various individual charged-particle beam optical elements (quadrupoles, bending

magnets,
) along the optic axis of the system. This in the language of the quantum
formalism would require to know the evolution of the wavefunction of the beam
particles as a function of ‘s’, the coordinate along the optic axis. Irrespective of the
) the
starting basic time-dependent equation (Schr¨odinger, Klein-Gordon, Dirac,
ﬁrst step is to obtain an equation of the form

where (x, y; s) constitute a curvilinear coordinate system, adapted to the geometry
system. For systems with straight optic axis, as it is customary we shall choose the
optic axis to lie along the Z-axis and consequently we have s = z and (x, y; z) con-
stitutes a rectilinear coordinate system. Eq. (1) is the basic equation in the quantum
formalism and we call it as the beam-optical equation;
and ψ as the beam-optical
Hamiltonian and the beam wavefunction respectively. The second step requires to
obtain a relationship for any relevant observable
at the transverse-plane at

s to the observable
at the transverse plane at sin, where sin is some input
reference point. This is achieved by the integration of the beam-optical equation

The two-step algorithm stated above may give an over-simpliﬁed picture of the
quantum formalism than, it actually is. There are several crucial points to be noted.
The ﬁrst-step in the algorithm of obtaining the beam-optical equation is not to be
treated as a mere transformation which eliminates t in preference to a variable s along
the optic axis. A clever set of transforms are required which not only eliminate the
variable t in preference to s but also gives us the s-dependent equation which has
a close physical and mathematical analogy with the original t-dependent equation
of standard time-dependent quantum mechanics. The imposition of this stringent
requirement on the construction of the beam-optical equation ensures the execution
of the second-step of the algorithm. The beam-optical equation is such, that all the
required rich machinery of quantum mechanics becomes applicable to compute the
transfer maps characterizing the optical system. This describes the essential scheme
of obtaining the quantum formalism. Rest is mostly a mathematical detail which is
built in the powerful algebraic machinery of the algorithm, accompanied with some
reasonable assumptions and approximations dictated by the physical considerations.
For instance, a straight optic axis is a reasonable assumption and paraxial approxi-
mation constitute a justiﬁable approximation to describe the ideal behaviour.

Before explicitly looking at the execution of the algorithm leading to the quan-
tum formalism in the spinor case, we further make note of certain other features.

Step-one of the algorithm is achieved by a set of clever transformations and an exact
expression for the beam-optical Hamiltonian is obtained in the case of Schr¨odinger,
Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations respectively, without resorting to any approxima-
tions! We expect this to be true even in the case of higher-spin equations. The
approximations are made only at step-two of the algorithm, while integrating the
beam-optical equation and computing the transfer maps for averages of the beam
parameters. Existence of approximations in the description of nonlinear behaviour is
not uncommon and should come as no surprise, afterall the beam optics constitutes a
nonlinear system. The nature of these approximations can be best summarized in the
optical terminology as; a systematic procedure of expanding the beam optical Hamil-
where p0 is the design (or average) momentum of
tonian in a power series of
beam particles moving predominantly along the direction of the optic axis and ˆπ
⊥
is the small transverse kinetic momentum. The leading order approximation along
1 constitutes the paraxial or ideal behaviour and higher order terms
with
in the expansion give rise to the nonlinear or aberrating behaviour. It is seen that
the paraxial and aberrating behaviour get modiﬁed by the quantum contributions
which are in powers of the de Broglie wavelength (λ0 = 2π¯h/p0). Lastly, and impor-
tantly the question of the classical limit of the quantum formalism; it reproduces the
well known Lie algebraic formalism [20] of charged-particle beam optics pioneered by
Dragt et al.

These transformations gives us the beam-optical Hamiltonian as required by step-
one of the algorithm. In the Dirac theory, the lower spinor components are much
smaller than the upper spinor components. This is also true for the beam-optical
equation derived above. The analogy between the standard Dirac equation and the
beam-optical equation, thus constructed can be summarized in the following table

From the above table it is clear that there is a very close analogy between the de-
rived beam-optical form and the standard Dirac equation. Having established this
analogy we can now execute step-two of the algorithm. As is well known the Foldy-
Wouthuysen machinery [21] enables one to take the proper nonrelativistic limit of
the Dirac equation and provides a systematic procedure for obtaining the relativistic
corrections to a desired degree of accuracy in powers of 1/m0c2. With the analogy in
the table above, we are now in position to adopt the Foldy-Wouthuysen machinery to

5

the beam-optical situation. The procedure of the Foldy-Wouthuysen-like machinery
gives us the paraxial behaviour and a systematic procedure to compute aberrations
to all orders in powers of 1/p0. To leading order we get

Up to now, all the observables, the ﬁeld components, time etc., have been deﬁned
in the laboratory frame. The covariant description of the spin of the Dirac particle has
simple operator representation in the rest frame of the particle. In the analysis of the
spin-dynamics in accelerator physics it is customary to use such a representation [18].
So we deﬁne the following transform which takes us from the beam-optical form to

Only at this stage we need to know the speciﬁc geometry of the magnetic lens, i.e., the
form of the ﬁelds characterizing the lens, for computing the transfer maps. We shall
brieﬂy consider the normal and skew quadrupoles respectively in the next sections
and see how the traditional transfer maps get modiﬁed by the quantum contributions.

Thus, we get the a fully quantum mechanical derivation for the traditional transfer
maps (transfer matrices) [4]. In addition we also get the spinor contributions, the
Stern-Gerlach kicks as they are called. In recent years there has been a campaign to
make a spin-splitter [22] device to produce polarized beams using the Stern-Gerlach
kicks. The spinor theory of charged-particle beam optics, in principle supports the
spin-splitter devices.

Again we get a quantum derivation of the traditional transfer maps [4] with some
spinor contributions. Due to the algebraic machinery of the quantum formalism it is
straightforward to see that the transfer maps of the skew quadrupole can be obtained
by rotation of the transfer maps for the normal quadrupole by π/4 along the optic
axis. For spin, the transfer map reads

4 Concluding Remarks and Directions for Future

Research

To summarize, an algorithm is presented for constructing a quantum theory of charged-
particle beam optics, starting ab initio from the basic equations of quantum mechanics
appropriate to the situation. This algorithm is used to construct a spinor theory of
accelerator optics starting ab initio from the Dirac equation, taking into account the
anomalous magnetic moment. The formalism is demonstrated by working out the
examples of the normal and skew magnetic quadrupoles respectively and as expected
there are small quantum contributions, which are proportional to the powers of the
de Broglie wavelength. It is further shown that the quantum formalism presented,
in the classical limit reproduces the Lie algebraic formalism [20] of charged-particle
beam optics.

The present algorithm is suited for constructing a quantum theory of charged-
particle beam optics at the single-particle level. The next logical step would be
to extend it to accommodate the realistic multiparticle dynamics. We feel that
clues to such a formalism can come from the experience gained from the so-called
quantum-like models [23]. These phenomenological models have been extensively de-
veloped in recent years to explain the classical collective behavior of a charged-particle
beam, by associating with the classical beam a quantum-like wavefunction obeying a
Schr¨odinger-like equation with the role of ¯h being played by the beam emittance ε.

One practical application of the quantum formalism would be to get a deeper
understanding of the polarized beams. A proposal to produce polarized beams using
the proposed spin-splitter devices based on the classical Stern-Gerlach kicks has been
presented recently [22].

Lastly it is speculated that the quantum theory of charged-particle beam optics
will be able to resolve the choice of the position operator in the Dirac theory and the
related question of the form of the force experienced by a charged-particle in external
electromagnetic ﬁelds [24]. This will be possible provided one can do an extremely
high precision experiment to detect the small diﬀerences arising in the transfer maps
from the diﬀerent choices of the position operators. These diﬀerences shall be very
small, i.e., proportional to powers of the de Broglie wavelength. It is the extremely
small magnitude of these minute diﬀerences which makes the exercise so challenging
and speculative!

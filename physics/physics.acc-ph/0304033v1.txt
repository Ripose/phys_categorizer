Transverse self-interactions within a ”line” bunch of electrons moving in an arc of a circle have
been studied extensively by us from an electrodynamical viewpoint. Here we treat an electron bunch
with a given vertical (i.e. perpendicular to the orbital plane) size by a generalization of our previous
work to the case of a test particle with vertical displacement interacting with a line bunch. In fact,
since a bunch with vertical extent can always be thought of as a superposition of displaced charge
lines, all the relevant physical aspects of the problem are included in the study of that simple model.
Our generalization results in a physically meaningful and quantitative explanation of the simulations
obtained with the code T raF iC 4 as well as in successful cross-checking of the code.

INTRODUCTION

Nowadays the production of high-brightness electron
bunches constitutes one of the most challenging and in-
teresting activities for particle accelerator physicists.

The growing interest of the community in this kind of
beams is justiﬁed by important applications such as self-
ampliﬁed spontaneous emission (SASE)-free-electron-
lasers operating in the x-ray region (see, amongst oth-
ers, [2]). Similar bunches are also being considered for
production of femtosecond radiation pulses by simpler
schemes based on Cherenkov and Transition Radiation
[3].

One of the challenges faced by physicists involved in
this area is constituted by the presence of self-ﬁeld in-
duced collective eﬀects. These eﬀects may spoil the
brightness of the electron beam.

Self-ﬁelds obey the usual Li´enard-Wiechert expres-
sions; the ﬁelds generated whenever an electron bunch
undergoes a motion under the inﬂuence of external forces
are diﬀerent from the usual space-charge self-interaction,
and are usually neglected in cases in which one does not
deal with high-brightness beams.

The equations for the ﬁeld form, together with the dy-
namical equations for the particle motion, a formidable
self-consistent problem. Its complete solution, that is the
particle evolution, is obtained only when one is able to

∗Electronic address: g.a.geloni@tue.nl

solve simultaneously the equations for the ﬁelds (elec-
trodynamical problem) and the equations of motion (dy-
namical problem): this task can be performed with the
help of self-consistent computer simulations. An example
of such codes is given (see [4]) by the program T raF iC4,
which will be used throughout this paper.

T raF iC4 has been used to predict self-ﬁeld related ef-
fects in the bunch compressor chicane to be used before
the main linac for the XFEL at DESY and it is, at the
time being, the only fully developed code used for XFEL
modelling both at DESY and SLAC. Results show that
the projected transverse emittance of the bunch grows
from 0.8 mm mrad after the injection to the signiﬁcantly
enhanced value of 2.6 mm mrad after the compressor [5].
Transverse dynamics is addressed by the code in two
steps: ﬁrst, the transverse electromagnetic forces, which
are well deﬁned and measurable physical quantities, are
calculated separately and, second, the equation of motion
is solved in a self-consistent way.

From this viewpoint a thorough understanding of
transverse electromagnetic forces by themselves is of
paramount importance since it allows to gain conﬁdence
in full simulation results. The behavior of these forces
can be obtained numerically by using the electromag-
netic solver of the code for a given source distribution
evolving rigidly along a certain trajectory (i.e. a zero en-
ergy spread is assumed throughout the bunch evolution),
but numerical results alone are not suﬃcient in order to
reach a full understanding of how electromagnetic forces
act. Consider for example the plot in Fig. 1, obtained
by using the electromagnetic solver of T raF iC4.

The ﬁgure shows the normalized radial force (i.e. the

onal to the test particle velocity and still lying on the
bending plane) felt by a test particle. Here λ is the bunch
density while h is the vertical (orthogonal to the bending
plane) displacement with respect to the center of a one-
dimensional bunch with rectangular density distribution
function.

The plot shows interesting characteristics: a very sharp
feature at the injection position, a transient and a steady
state, which we can observe but for which there is no intu-
itive physical explanation. The electromagnetic problem
is, of course, only a part of the formidable evolution prob-
lem but its understanding is perse an important physical
issue.

Analytical investigations of this simpliﬁed, although
very important situation are therefore needed in order to
see the meaning of the simulation results, besides provid-
ing, from a more practical viewpoint, important cross-
checks. We will show that through this kind of study
we can understand the features of Fig. 1 from a physi-
cal viewpoint, deal with characteristic times and lengths
and, as a very practical result, validate the simulation
results by producing analytical cross-checks.

The self-interaction in the longitudinal direction (par-
allel, at any time, to the velocity vector by deﬁnition)
is responsible for the energy exchange between the sys-
tem and the acceleration ﬁeld and for all CSR (Coherent
Synchrotron Radiation)-related phenomena, which have
been studied extensively elsewhere (see, amongst others,
[4]... [13]).

Self-forces in the transverse direction were ﬁrst ad-
dressed, in the case of a circular motion, and from an elec-
trodynamical viewpoint, in [14]. Further analysis ([11],
[15]... [17]) considers, again, the case of circular motion
both from an electrodynamical and a dynamical view-

3

point. We proposed a fully electrodynamical analysis of
a bunch moving in an arc of a circle in [1], where, for
the reasons explained before, we were not interested in
the full evolution problem. Nevertheless, in that paper
we addressed the issue of understanding the electromag-
netic interactions only in the framework of a 1D model.
Before our study in [1] there was no explanation for the
simulation results shown in Fig. 1. The work in [1]
provided a qualitative explanation of these results: such
qualitative character of the explanation is due to the fact
that the model in [1] is one-dimensional, and does not al-
low any quantitative investigation when (as in Fig. 1) a
vertical displacement is introduced. Still it was possible
to demonstrate that the sharp feature near the injection
point is due to interactions of the test particle with par-
ticles in front of it, while the transient part is due to the
interaction with particles behind it.

In this paper we aim at an extension of the model pro-
posed in [1] which allows a fully electrodynamical analysis
of a bunch endowed with a vertical dimension. Since a
bunch with vertical extent can be always thought of as
a superposition of displaced charge lines, all the relevant
physical aspects of the problem are included in the study
of a simpler model, constituted by a one-dimensional
line bunch and a test particle with vertical displacement,
which is the situation studied in Fig. 1. In this article,
our explanation of the features in Fig. 1 will be eventu-
ally reﬁned to a quantitative level.

The paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst treat, in
Section II, the transverse interaction between two par-
ticles moving in an arc of a circle, supposing that one
of the two particles has a vertical displacement h with
respect to the source. By integration of our results we
consider, in Section III, a stepped-proﬁle electron bunch
interacting with a test particle with vertical displacement
entering an arc of a circle and we discuss all the charac-
teristic lengths involved. Finally, in Section IV, we come
to a summary of the results obtained and to conclusions.

II. TRANSVERSE INTERACTION BETWEEN
TWO ELECTRONS

We will ﬁrst address the case of two electrons moving
in an arc of a circle of radius R, in such a way that one of
the two is displaced, with respect to the reference trajec-
tory, by a quantity h in the vertical (perpendicular to the
bending plane) direction. We will see that, as concerns
the interaction in the radial direction (in the bending
plane) it does not matter which particle is endowed with
this displacement.

The electro-magnetic force which one of the two par-
ticles (designated with ”T”, i.e. the test particle) feels,
due to the interaction with the other one (designated
with ”S”, i.e. the source particle), is given by

F (rT, t) = eE(rT, t) + ecβT × B(rT, t),

(1)

where rT is the position of the test particle, e is the
electron charge with its own (negative) sign, βT is the
velocity of the test particle normalized to the speed of
light, c, while E(rT, t) and B(rT, t) are, respectively,
the electric and the magnetic ﬁeld generated at a given
time t by the source particle S, at the position of the test
particle T, namely

two points and γS is the usual Lorentz factor referred to
the source particle at the retarded time t′.

In contrast to the case studied in [1], the transverse
(by deﬁnition, orthogonal to βT) projection of F (rT, t)
has now components both in the bending plane and per-
pendicular to it. We will introduce, therefore, two unit
vectors ˆeh, in the direction perpendicular to the bend-
ing plane, and ˆep, in the radial direction, i.e. orthogonal
to βT and lying in the bending plane. Of course, the
transverse component of F (rT, t) can still be written, fol-
lowing [1], as the sum of contributions from the velocity
(”C”, Coulomb) and the acceleration (”R”, Radiation)
ﬁelds, namely

A. Tail-Head interaction: case of two particles in
circular motion

We will ﬁrst consider the situation in which the test
particle is in front of the source. In this case, one can
refer to Fig. 2 for all the possible conﬁgurations of the
present position of the test electron and the retarded po-
sition of the source with respect to the arc. The vertical
displacement h of one of the two particles is to be imag-
ined in the direction perpendicular to the ﬁgure plane.

Let us start with the steady state case in Fig. 2b. We
can deﬁne with ∆s the curvilinear distance between the
present position of the test and of the source particle; φ
will indicate the angular distance between the retarded
position of the source and the present position of the test
electron, and it will be designated as the retarded angle.
Finally, h will be the vertical displacement.

In the following we will assume βS = βT = β. There-
fore we can write Eq. (5) and Eq. (6) in the following
way:

F⊥C =

As one can readily see by inspecting Eq. (9), when we im-
pose reasonable values for ∆s ≪ R and h ≪ R we obtain
corresponding values of φ ≪ 1. We will therefore assume
φ ≪ 1 throughout this paper, and verify a posteriori

the validity of this assumption when studying particular
situations. Note that, by ﬁxing φ ≪ 1 we keep open
the possibility of comparing φ with the synchrotron ra-
diation formation angle 1/γ (note that a deﬂection angle
smaller or larger than 1/γ is characteristic of the cases,
respectively, of undulator or synchrotron radiation). We
can therefore expand Eq. (7) and Eq. (8) to the second
non-vanishing order in φ thus obtaining

and

and

Here and above ˆφ = γφ. This normalization choice, al-
ready treated in [7], is quite natural, 1/γ being the syn-
chrotron radiation formation-angle at the critical wave-
length. In the derivation of Eq. (10) and Eq. (11) (and in
the following, too) we understood ˆφ ≫ 1/γ, which is jus-
tiﬁed by the ultrarelativistic approximation. Moreover
we deﬁned ˆh = hγ2/R; in order to understand this deﬁ-
nition we ﬁrst write down the retardation condition Eq.
(9) in approximate form. Since we are already working
in the limit ∆s/R ≪ 1 and φ ≪ 1, then in order to have
∆s > 0, h < Rφ must be satisﬁed. We will automatically
recover from our results that the assumption h ≪ Rφ is
suﬃciently good for our purposes. Therefore Eq. (9) can
be approximated with:

∆s = (1 − β)Rφ +

The latter can be written down in dimensionless form too
as

which explains the choice of the deﬁnition for ˆh.

The reader may easily check that Eq. (12), Eq. (13)
and Eq. (15) (as well as Eq. (7) and Eq. (8)) are gener-
alizations of the expressions given in [1] by taking their
limit for ˆh −→ 0.

The following expression, which is valid for the total
transverse force felt by the test particle can be then triv-
ially derived

where Φ is deﬁned by

Φ( ˆφ) = ΦR( ˆφ) + ΦC( ˆφ),

(17)

B. Tail-Head interaction: case (a)

Let us now consider the other cases depicted in Fig.
2a, c and d. While the case in Fig. 2b deals with the
steady state situation in which the present position of the
test and the retarded position of the source are both in
the bend, Fig. 2a, c and d deal with transient situations
in which we can ﬁnd the retarded source and the present
test in the straight line before and after the bend too.

Consider the situation in Fig. 2a. In this case, under
the assumption h ≪ (y + Rφ), the retardation condition
reads

∆ˆs ≃

ˆh2 − ˆφ3/3(ˆy + ˆφ/4)
ˆy + ˆφ

,

(18)

where we introduced the normalized quantity ˆy = yγ/R,
which is just y/R normalized to the synchrotron radiation
formation angle, 1/γ.

In this case the source particle is only responsible for
a velocity ﬁeld contribution, therefore F⊥ = F⊥C. By
direct use of Eq. (5), one can ﬁnd the exact expression
for F⊥

F⊥ =

It can be easily veriﬁed that, as it must be, Eq.
(21)
reduces to Eq. (10) in the limit ˆy → 0. Also, the reader
may check that in the limit ˆh → 0, Eq. (21) reduces to
already derived expressions in [1].

Let us now deﬁne the normalized radial force ˆF =
Fp/[e2/(4πε0R∆s)]. It is possible, by means of Eq. (21),
to plot ˆF as a function of the position after the injection
(deﬁned by the entrance of the test particle in the hard-
edge magnet) for a ﬁxed value of ∆ˆs = ∆sγ3/R = 5.0
and diﬀerent values of h. In Fig. 3 we compare such a
plot with numerical results from the code TRAFIC4 (see
[4]).

Note that, as already pointed out in [1], at the posi-
tion which corresponds to the entrance of the retarded
source in the magnet there is a discontinuity in the plots.
This is linked to our model choice, and it is due to the
abrupt (hard edge magnet) switching on of the accelera-
tion ﬁelds.

As general remark to Fig. 3 and, in fact to Fig. 4,
6 and Fig.11, the perfect agreement between our calcu-
lations and numerical results by TRAFIC4 provides, per
se, an excellent cross-check between our analytical re-
sults (with their assumptions and applicability region)
and simulations.

C. Tail-Head interaction: case (c)

We will now move to the case depicted in Fig. 2c, in
which the source particle has its retarded position inside
the bend and the test particle has its present position
in the straight line following the magnet. We will de-
ﬁne with x the distance, along the straight line after the
magnet, between the end of the bend and the present po-
sition of the test particle. Here ˆφm = γφm, φm being the
angular extension of magnet, and ˆx = γx/R, the reason
for this normalization choice for x being identical to that
for y.

exerted by the source particle on the test particle

FIG. 5: Time variation of a synchrotron radiation pulse gen-
erated by a highly relativistic electron moving in a circle as
seen by an observer in the orbital plane

Similarly to the latter case, it can be easily veriﬁed that
Eq. (27) and Eq. (28) reduce to Eq. (10) and Eq. (11),
respectively, in the limit x → 0. Moreover, in the limit
h → 0, they reduce to already known expressions given in
[1]. Again, one can plot the normalized radial force ˆF as a
function of the position after the ejection, deﬁned by the
exit of the test particle from the hard-edge magnet, for
diﬀerent values of ˆh and a ﬁxed value of ∆ˆs = ∆sγ3/R =
5.0. In Fig. 4 we compare such a plot with numerical
results from TRAFIC4.

At the position which corresponds to the exit of the
retarded source from the magnet there is a discontinuity

in the plots. This, again, is linked to our model choice,
and it is due to the fact that, for particles on axis, af-
ter the retarded source has left the magnet there is only
Coulomb repulsion along the longitudinal direction.

It is suggestive to notice the resemblance of the peaks
shown in Fig. 4 with half of the time pulse of the ra-
dial electric ﬁeld from usual synchrotron radiation pro-
cess (see Fig. 5, and [18]). This is not a coincidence. The
test particle is, indeed, far away from the source with re-
spect to the formation length R/γ3 and the magnetic ﬁeld
contribution to the Lorentz force can be expected to have
the same behavior of the electric ﬁeld contribution, since
B = (ˆn × E)/c. The only diﬀerence is that the observer
is now ”running away” from the electromagnetic signal
which will result in a spreading of the pulse of about a
factor (1 − β)−1. Since R = 1 m and γ = 100 we expect
the pulse to be long about (R/γ3)(1 − β)−1 ∼ 10−2 m.
D. Tail-Head interaction: case (d)

The last Tail-Head case left to discuss is depicted in
Fig. 2d; the source particle has its retarded position in
the straight line before the bend, and the test particle
has its present position in the straight line following the
magnet. The retardation condition reads

It is easy to verify that Eq. (35) reduces, respectively,
to the steady state (Eq. (10)) when x = 0 and y = 0,
to the transient case in Fig. 2a when x = 0 (Eq. (21))
and to the transient case in Fig. 2c when y = 0 (Eq.
(24)). Moreover the reader may verify that, in the limit
h −→ 0, Eq. (35) reduces to already known results in
[1]. Following the treatment of the transient situations
in Fig. 2a and in Fig. 2c we plot, for this case too,
a normalized expression for the transient force, i.e. the
usual ˆF , as a function of the curvilinear position of the
test particle (s = 0 indicates the entrance of the magnet)
for diﬀerent values of ˆh and a ﬁxed value of ∆ˆs = ∆sγ3/R
and magnet length. In Fig. 6, we compare our analytical
results with numerical results from TRAFIC4, for a ﬁxed
value of ∆ˆs = 5.0 and ˆφm = 1 and for diﬀerent values of
the vertical displacement ˆh.

E. Head-Tail interaction

Finally, we can deal with the situation in which the
source particle is ahead of the test electron, i.e. ∆s < 0;
we will talk, in this case, of head-tail interaction. On
the one hand it is evident that, when ∆s < 0, the source
particle is ahead of the test electron at any time; on the
other hand it is not true that the present position of the
test particle is, in general, ahead of the retarded position
of the test particle. As already suggested in [1], if ∆s < 0
and, approximatively, |∆s| < h the test particle overtakes
the retarded position of the source before the electromag-
netic signal reaches it. In this case, although we may still
talk about head-tail interaction, since ∆s < 0, its real
character is very much similar to the case ∆s > 0, just
treated in the previous subsections, in which the electro-
magnetic signal has to catch up with the test particle. In
order to understand the physics involved in this situation
it is suﬃcient to study the cases ∆s < 0 and |∆s| > h.
The case ∆s < 0 with |∆s| < h will be treated from
a qualitative viewpoint only:
its quantitative analysis,
which may be interesting to perform for the sake of com-
pleteness, presents stronger mathematical diﬃculties and

FIG. 6: Normalized radial force ˆF for a two-particle system
crossing a hard-edge bending magnet as a function of the
position of the test particle inside the magnet in the case
of a short magnet φm ≪ 1. Results are shown for diﬀerent
values of ˆh. The solid lines show analytical results; the circles
describe the outcome from TRAFIC4. Here the normalized
distance between the two particles is ∆ˆs = 5, while ˆφm = 1.

is left for future study. Anyway a qualitative treatment
of this situation is enough to reach a full understanding
of the interaction physics, which is our goal here.

Consider therefore the case ∆s < 0 with |∆s| > h. It is
important to note that, once the steady state case is stud-
ied, the situation in which the source particle is ahead of
the test electron can be treated immediately for all three
(a, c and d) transient cases in Fig. 2 (of course, with
respect to the ﬁgure, test and source particle exchange
roles) on the basis of the steady state case alone. In fact
in that situation, as it has already been said in [1], we can
assume the retarded angle φ small enough (the test par-
ticle ”runs against” the electromagnetic signal) that the
actual trajectory followed by the particles is not essential
and one can use the steady state expression to describe

also the transient cases. It can be shown that the only
important contribution from the source particle comes
from the acceleration part of the Lienard-Wiechert ﬁelds.
Within our approximations, the only non-negligible con-
tribution is present in the situation (again, with the roles
of test and source particle inverted) depicted in Fig. 2a
and Fig. 2b, the latter just being the steady state case.
Let us deal with the steady state case of head-tail in-
teraction in the case |∆s| > h. As already discussed in
[1], the diﬀerence with respect to the situation in which
the test electron is in front of the source is that the test
electron ”runs against” the electromagnetic signal emit-
ted by the source, while in the other case it just ”runs
away” from it. Therefore the relative velocity between
the signal and the test electron is equal to (1 + β)c, in-
stead of (1 − β)c as in the other situation. Hence the
retardation condition reads

∆s ≃ Rφ + β

Note that, in the asymptotic for ∆ˆs ≫ γˆh we recover the
result in [1] for the one-dimensional case.

In the general case, βS is almost parallel to (and equal
to) βT and antiparallel to the projection of ˆn on the
bending plane: it turns out that the only important con-
tribution to the radial force on the orbital plane is given
by the second term on the right side of Eq. (6), and it is
easy to check that

F⊥ ≃

e2
4πε0R∆s

(38)

It may be worthwhile to underline that the force in Eq.

(38) is, structurally, identical to the result in [1] although,
of course, ∆s is now a function of h .

III. TRANSVERSE INTERACTION BETWEEN
AN ELECTRON AND A BUNCH ENTERING A
BEND FROM A STRAIGHT PATH

In the previous Section we dealt with all the possible
conﬁgurations for a two-particle system moving in an arc
of a circle. Now we are ready to provide a quantitative
explanation of Fig. 1.

After the discussion, in Section II, about head-tail in-
teractions within a system with the test particle behind
the source electron, one is led to the qualitative conclu-
sion that, within an electron bunch, interactions between
sources in front of the test particle and the test particle
itself are important and, in general, they must be re-
sponsible, at the entrance and at the exit of the bending
magnet, for sharp changes in the transverse forces acting
on the test electron. The quantitative change depends,
of course, on the position of the test particle inside the
bunch: the extreme cases are for the test particle at the
head of the bunch, where there are just interactions with
electrons behind the test particle (no head-tail interac-
tions), and for the test particle before the tail of the
bunch, at a distance |∆s| > h, where all the sources are
in front of it (only head-tail interactions in the regime
|∆s| > h).

A. Head-Tail interaction

Consider now the situation in which a one-dimensional
line bunch interacts with a particle positioned at the cen-
ter of the line but vertically displaced by a quantity h.
As already said we will discuss, analytically, the head-
tail interaction for |∆s| > h only. Since the trajectory
followed by the bunch is not important we can simply
integrate Eq. (38) and ﬁnd the contribution

F B

p HT(φ) ≃

e2λ0/(4πε0R) ln [∆smax/(∆smax − Rφ(1 + β))]

(

e2λ0/(4πε0R) ln[∆smax/h]

0

φ < 0

0 < φ < Φ(h, ∆smax)
φ > Φ(h, βh)

,

(39)

where ”HT” stands for ”head-tail” and Φ(h, ∆s) is the
solution, in φ, of Eq. (36) at vertical displacement h and
longitudinal distance ∆s.

When a bunch longer than the vertical displacement
h enters the magnet, the particles in front of the bunch
will interact with the test electron following Eq. (39),
which models the radial interaction on the basis of Eq.
(38). Nevertheless, Eq. (38) cannot describe the situ-

ation when the sources at a distance shorter than the
vertical displacement h begin to interact with the test
electron. As a result the head-tail interaction has two
characteristic formation lengths. The ﬁrst one indicates
the distance that the test electron travels from the mo-
ment it is reached by the electromagnetic signal from
the ﬁrst particle entering the bend, till the moment it
is reached by the electromagnetic signal emitted as the

FIG. 7: Normalized radial force ˆF from the head of the bunch

the limit for h << lb/2 Eq. (37), substituted in the ex-

second characteristic length is given by the distance that
the test electron travels from the moment it is reached by
the electromagnetic signal from the particle at ∆s = −h
till the moment it is reached by the electromagnetic sig-
nal emitted by the particle with ∆s = 0 as it enters the
bend. This can be estimated to be, roughly, equal to

to know the present angular position of the test particle
when ∆s = 0 one should solve the retardation condition

(40)

In the limit in which sin(φ/2) ≃ φ/2 we have φ ≃ γh/R
and L2 ≃ γh.

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

This reasoning can explain pretty well the features in
Fig. 7. The radial force grows exactly as described in Eq.
(39) starting from about z = −lb/4 = 50 µm until z = 0
(which is roughly the ﬁrst formation length). Note that
with the source located at ∆s = h corresponds a retarded
angle φ = 0, which means that the electromagnetic signal
from this source, which is emitted at z = 0, will reach the
test particle when this has also the position z = 0. After
z = 0, the test particle begins to interact with the sources
located at ∆s > −h while the ones at ∆s < −h reach a
steady state, in the sense that they keep on interacting
in the same way with the test electron.

FIG. 8: The same as Fig. 7 for a diﬀerent range. Normalized
radial force from the head of the bunch (∆s < 0) to the tail
as the bunch progresses inside the bend (z = 0 corresponds
to the injection of the test particle in the magnet). Here
R = 1m, γ = 100, h = 10µm and the bunch length is 200µm.
The test particle is located at ∆s = 0. Curve A corresponds to
the simulation by T raF iC 4, curve B is the contribution, given
by Eq. 39, of the particles with ∆s < −h; A-B is the diﬀerence
between the two curves, ascribed to the contribution from the
particles with ∆s > −h.

This is illustrated by Fig. 8, where the normalized

radial force ˆF is plotted.

The diﬀerence between the simulation results and the
analytical estimation in Eq. (39) gives, quantitatively,
the radial interaction due to the sources at ∆s > −h.
For h = 10 µm and γ = 100, as in our case, one expects
a second formation length equal to 10−3 m which is ex-
actly what one gets: the actual data show, in fact, that
a maximum is reached when z = 0.001 m at ˆF ≃ 7.098.
Fig. 8 also shows the steady state regime, when all the
particles in front of the test particle interact with the lat-
ter from inside the bend. The solid line in Fig. 8 shows,
once again, the interaction with the sources located at
∆s < −h. Finally, in Fig. 9 we present the results from
T raF iC4 for several values of h. Of course, when h > lb,
i.e. h > 100 µm there are no sources characterized by
∆s < −h at all.

One may expect that the system enters the steady state
at z ≃ γh, which is correct for h = 1 µm, h = 10 µm
and, by ﬁgure inspection, for h = 100 µm. Nevertheless,
in the case h = 1 mm and h = 10 mm the system en-
ters the steady state at, respectively, z ≃ 0.054 m and
z ≃ 0.186 m, which are clearly smaller than γh. The rea-
son for this apparent discrepancy is due to the approxi-
mation sin(φ/2) ≃ φ/2 which has been used to derive the
rule of thumb L2 ≃ γh starting from the retardation con-
dition Eq. (40). A comparison between the rule of thumb
proposed before (dashed line) and the real solution of the

siderations suggest that this order of magnitude will not
change appreciably up to ∆s of order −h/γ. As a result,
the region (0, −h/γ) gives a contribution, after integra-
tion, proportional, approximately, to λ/R. On the other
hand, the maximum interaction in the region ∆s < −h
is of the order of e/(Rh), which also corresponds, after
integration, to a magnitude proportional to λ/R. This
explains the reason why a small region −h < ∆s < 0 can
give contributions of the same order of magnitude as the
much longer interval in which ∆s < −h.

B. Tail-Head interaction

We will now analyze the tail-head part of the interac-
tion when ∆s > 0. In the case where the bunch enters the
bend we have contributions from retarded sources both
in the bend and in the straight line before the bend. The
contribution from the retarded sources in the magnet can

(∆s < 0) to the tail as the bunch progresses inside the bend
(z = 0 corresponds to the injection of the test particle in the
magnet). Here R = 1m and γ = 100. Here we plot the results
from T raF iC 4 for several values of ˆh. The bunch length is
200µm. The test particle is located at ∆s = 0.

retardation condition (solid line) is given in Fig. 10: one
can easily see that, when h = 1 mm, φ ≃ 0.054. In the
same way, at h = 10 mm, φ ≃ 0.186 (remember that
R = 1m).

By comparison, in Fig. 7, between the contributions
to the head-tail interaction in the cases ∆s < −h and
−h < ∆s < 0 the reader can see that these are compa-
rable in magnitude, although h is much shorter than the
bunch length. A qualitative explanation of this fact can
be given. When ∆s ≪ φR, so that it can in fact be ne-
glected in the retardation condition, one gets φ ≃ γh/R.
Now, the force felt by the test particle in the zeroth order
in φ is proportional to γ3/(R2 ˆφ) ≃ γ/(Rh): simple con-

where ”m” is a reminder that the contributions treated
by Eq. (41) are all from the ”magnet”. All that is left to
do now, is to investigate the values which ˆφmin and ˆφmax
assume.

Let us ﬁrst deﬁne with ˆη the normalized angular posi-
tion of the test particle inside the bending magnet. Now
deﬁne with ˆφ∗ the solution of the retardation equation
∆ˆsmin = ˆφ∗/2 + ˆφ∗3/24 − ˆh2/(2 ˆφ∗). If ˆφ∗ < ˆη, the re-
tarded position of the ﬁrst source particle is in the bend-
ing magnet, and ˆφmin = ˆφ∗. On the other hand, when

ˆφ∗ > ˆφ there are no contributions to the radial force from
the bend.

Next, we deﬁne with ˆφ∗∗ the solution of ∆ˆsmax =
ˆφ∗∗/2 + ˆφ∗∗3/24 − ˆh2/(2 ˆφ∗∗) (in our case ∆ˆsmax will be
equal to one half of the normalized bunch length). Sup-
posing ˆφ∗ < ˆη, if ˆφ∗∗ < ˆη too, then all the particles
contribute from the bend, and ˆφmax = ˆφ∗∗. On the other
hand, when ˆφ∗∗ > ˆη, we have a mixed situation, in which
part of the particles contribute from the bend and others

( ˆφ3/24)(4ˆy∗ + ˆφ)/(ˆy∗ + ˆφ) − ˆh2/(2ˆy∗ + 2 ˆφ). If ˆy∗ > 0,
the retarded position of the ﬁrst source particle is in the
straight line before the bending magnet, and ˆymin = ˆy∗.
On the other hand, when ˆy∗ < 0, the retarded position
of the ﬁrst source particle is in the bend, and ˆymin = 0.
Next, we deﬁne with ˆy∗∗ the solution of ∆ˆsmax = ( ˆφ +
ˆy∗∗)/2 + ( ˆφ3/24)(4ˆy∗∗ + ˆφ)/(ˆy∗∗ + ˆφ − ˆh2/(2ˆy∗∗ + 2 ˆφ))
(again, in our case ∆ˆsmax is just half the bunch length
normalized to R/γ3). Consider the case ˆy∗∗ < 0: all the
particles contribute from the bend, that is we entered the
steady-state situation. In this case ˆymax = ˆymin = 0. On
the other hand, when ˆy∗∗ > 0, we have again a mixed
situation, in which part of the particles contribute from
the bend and others from the straight line before the
magnet. In this case ˆymax = ˆy∗∗.

The following step is to actually plot the radial force
exerted on an electron by a bunch with rectangular dis-
tribution entering a long bend. Our results, compared,
once again, with simulations by TRAFIC4, are shown in
Fig. 11 for a bunch length of 100 µm, γ = 100, R = 1 m
and for diﬀerent values of ∆ˆs. A perfect agreement is ob-
tained with the results by T raF iC4. A ﬁrst characteristic
length is obviously given by the solution of the retarda-
tion condition with ∆s = lb/2, and gives the position at
which the test particle begins to feel a steady interaction
from the tail sources. There is a second characteristic
length more diﬃcult to see, though: a careful inspection
of Fig. 11 shows, in fact, a small irregularity (actually
a discontinuity in the ﬁrst derivative) in the curve for
ˆh = 1 at the position z ≃ 1 cm. Such irregularities are
present in all the curves in Fig. 11, although one has to
look carefully for them by magnifying parts of the plots,
as shown in Figs. 12A-D. It is this fact which actually
suggests the presence of a second formation length.

When the value of h is small the discontinuity is lo-
for example when
cated, approximately, at z ≃ γh:
h = 1 µm,
in Fig. 12A, we have a discontinuity in
the ﬁrst derivative of the curve at z ≃ 0.1 mm. Nev-
In fact,
ertheless, this value changes as we increase h.
when h = 1 mm, in Fig. 12C, the discontinuity is at
z ≃ 5.4 cm, while when h = 1 cm, in Fig. 12D, we ﬁnd
a value of z ≃ 18.6 cm: these are the same numerical
values found when discussing the entrance in the steady
state of the Head-Tail interaction in the previous subsec-
tion. The reader will remember that these are, in fact,
the solutions of Eq. (40). From a physical viewpoint,
the solution of Eq. (40) is the position at which the test
particle begins to feel the electromagnetic signal from the
source at ∆s = 0.

Before that point, the test particle feels interaction
from particles behind it but only due to velocity ﬁelds,
since the retarded positions of all the electrons behind
the test one are not yet in the bend. After that particu-
lar point, the force on our test electrons has a component
due to the acceleration ﬁeld too. This suggests that the

FIG. 12: Normalized radial force (analytical result) acting on a test particle from a bunch with rectangular density distribution
entering a hard-edge bending magnet as a function of the position of the test particle inside the magnet. We chose ∆smax =
100µm, γ = 100, R = 1 m; several curves for diﬀerent values of ˆh are shown. A clear discontinuity in the ﬁrst derivative is
visible.

physical meaning of the presence of this second formation
length is simply the switching on of the contribution of
the acceleration ﬁeld. As a last remark it is interesting
to note that Tail-Head and Head-Tail interactions have
a characteristic length in common, but for completely
diﬀerent reasons.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we presented a fully electrodynamical
study of transverse self-forces within an electron bunch
moving in an arc of a circle in the case the test particle is
endowed with a vertical displacement h. We strived for
a generalization of the results obtained in [1] in order to
obtain a better qualitative and quantitative explanation
of the physics involved in the problem and, in particular,
to explain the behavior of the self-interaction depicted in

First we generalized the results in [1] in the case of
a two-particle system. Then, by integration of these re-
sults, the case of a line bunch and a test particle with a
vertical displacement was studied. This case includes all
the relevant physics present in the situation of a bunch
with vertical size.

Besides allowing one to generalize results obtained in
[1], our study aimed at a physical understanding of the
results by T raF iC4: we found that the bunch can be di-
vided into four separate regions (over which one can inte-
grate the two-particle interaction) corresponding to four
diﬀerent types of source-test interaction, namely head-
tail with |∆s| < h, head-tail with |∆s| > h, tail-head
with contributions from velocity ﬁelds alone, and tail-
head with contributions from both acceleration and ve-
locity ﬁeld. We found that these regions correspond to
four characteristic formation lengths, which can be deter-

16

mined quantitatively by simple analytical calculations.

For the ﬁrst, the third, and the fourth region, we could
use relatively simple analytical results in order to de-
scribe the situation and easily perform crosschecking with
T raF iC4. The perfect agreement we found gives us much
information: this constitutes, in fact, a reliable cross-
check which provides, at the same time, very strong indi-
cation that the code calculates the self-interaction in the
proper way and that the approximations which we made
in our analytical theory are correct. Moreover, we have
physical explanations of the self-interactions in terms of
formation-lengths and type of source-test interaction.

Because of mathematical diﬃculties linked with the
structure of the retardation condition we left the quan-

titative discussion of the second region (−h < ∆s < 0)
for future work. Nevertheless we were able to understand
the physical meaning of this region and to determine its
formation length.

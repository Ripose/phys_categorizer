We investigate inﬂuence on the storage ring beam dynamics of the coherent Synchrotron Radiation
(SR) self ﬁelds produced by an electron bunch. We show that the maximum energy gain in the RF
cavity must far exceed the energy loss of electrons due to the coherent SR.

INTRODUCTION

The energy ε of a particle in storage rings oscillates
in the vicinity of the equilibrium energyεs. The diﬀer-
ence between equilibrium and nonequilibrium energies
is proportional to the derivative of the particle’s phase

a particle in the storage ring. Equilibrium values have
lower index s [1-3]. The radio frequency (RF) voltage
in the cavity’s gap is varying as V = Vrf cos ωrf t, where
ωrf is the radio frequency; h, the subharmonic number
of radio frequency.

riod of a single revolution T = 1/f = C/c = 2πR(1+µ)/c

The spontaneous coherent SR doesn’t depend on the

the longitudinal direction, the shape of the beam and
on the number of particles. For the Gauss longitudinal

It is supposed here that the phase in the center of the

If the laser beam is homogeneous and its transversal di-
mensions far exceed ones of the electron beam, the powers
of Thomson scattering radiation and spontaneous inco-
herent SR obey the simple power dependence as functions

Incoherent synchrotron radiation and Thompson scat-
tering cause slow damping of phase oscillations (the
damping time far exceeds the period of oscillations) and
can be neglected in the ﬁrst approximation, so equation

The coherent synchrotron radiation force acts simi-
lar to the radio frequency accelerating ﬁeld. The au-
tophasing force of the storage ring is deﬁned by the
derivative dV (ϕ)/dϕ. Thus, in accordance with (5), the
reaction of the coherent SR makes this force weaker.
This weakening reaches maximum when the phase equals
ϕ = ϕs + hσs/R (1 + µ). Therefore the stability of the
electron beam requires that the derivative dV (ϕ)/dϕ is
negative in the interval
< hσs/R(1 + µ). This
−
phase range corresponds to the stable oscillations of the
majority of particles with amplitudes A
σs. Using the
formulas for the power of the coherent SR (3) for a beam
with Gauss longitudinal distribution of particles one can

Example

An electron storage ring has the radius R=50 cm,
h=10, σs= 1 cm, µ = 1, N = 1010,sin ϕs ≈
1. In this
case the losses of a synchronous particle per a revolution
is V rad
coh (ϕs)= 9.25 kev, Vrf > 114 kV. Thus for the sta-
ble storage ring operation the RF cavity voltage should
be much higher than the coherent radiation losses. The
shielding by the vacuum chamber can weaken this re-
quirement [5]. One should also note that the energy losses
of a synchronous electron per a revolution are approxi-
mately 22/3 times greater than average losses of electrons
in the beam (see Appendix).

the authors used formula from the work of Shiﬀ [10] and
erred in converting it to their deﬁnition of the valueσx.
They multiplied the Shiﬀ’s formula by the 24/3 instead of
dividing by it. In the remaining references the source of
errors is unclear but more probably connected with the
same mistake.

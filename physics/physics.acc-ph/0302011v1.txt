We analyze in this work the energy transfer process of accelerated charges,
the mass ﬂuctuations accompanying this process, and their inertial properties.
Based on a previous work, we use here the dipole antenna, which is a very
convenient framework for such analysis, for analyzing those characteristics. We
show that the radiation process can be viewed by two energy transfer processes:
one from the energy source to the charges and the second from the charges
into the surrounding space. Those processes, not being in phase, result in mass
ﬂuctuations. The same principle is true during absorption. We show that in
a transient period between absorption and radiation the dipole antenna gains
mass according to the amount of absorbed energy and loses this mass as radi-
ated energy. We rigorously prove that the gain of mass, resulting from electrical
interaction has inertial properties in the sense of Newton’s third low. We arrive
to this result by modeling the reacting spacetime region by an electric dipole.

Key words: radiation resistance, self force, energy transfer, charges.

1. INTRODUCTION

The common belief that an accelerating charge always radiates energy is re-
viewed. There are two Lienard-Wiechert potentials: one retarded and one ad-

1

vanced. For reasons of causality, the advanced solution is usually disregarded.
It is considered as a ﬁeld which “knows” the future motion of a charged particle.
But another way of interpreting the advanced ﬁeld is to deﬁne it as the ﬁeld
which establishes the future motion of the particles.

Let us imagine a stationary charged particle, and some remote source of
radiation, distributed spatially in such a way as to create radiation of the same
pattern as a dipole antenna, but propagating inwards towards the particle. May
such a ﬁeld correspond exactly to the advanced ﬁeld of one charged particle?
The answer here is no, because the advanced ﬁeld contains the Coulomb compo-
nent, and there is no way to create a Coulomb ﬁeld from a far distributed source
(because of the Gauss law). In other words it is obvious that the advanced ﬁeld
cannot create the state of a single charged particle.

But if we modify the above question: may such a ﬁeld correspond exactly
to the advanced ﬁeld of a neutral distribution of charged particles? Such a
distribution is Coulomb free, and therefore the answer here is yes. The best
example of such a charge distribution is an antenna. Also a single electric
dipole is a good approximation to such a charge distribution. And one may
state that as long as the advanced ﬁeld does not interact with the above charge
distribution, there is no charge (because the interaction domain is neutral). The
charge becomes evident during the interaction. In this case one may state that
the advanced ﬁeld creates the charges. Or, in other words the advanced ﬁeld
converges into the future space-time domain of the charges, and creates a new
body deﬁned by the charge distribution.

It is to be mentioned that considering the interaction region as totally neutral
before the interaction occurs, does not reduce the generality of the problem,
because we assume the universe is neutral, and hence every charge in nature
has its opposite sign counterpart. Therefore every space-time region is neutral
on a suﬃciently large scale. In this work we consider the interaction region to
be large enough to validate the neutral system assumption; alternatively, we
may restrict ourselves to systems which are locally neutral.

Where does this energy go now? If this charge distribution antenna is con-
nected to a resistor which equals the radiation resistance of the antenna (i.e.
impedance-matched), the energy transforms into heat. If the antenna is in open
circuit (or shorted), the energy is radiated back into the space, on the same
radiation pattern, and we will show that during the period of interaction, the
antenna gains inertial mass.

This energy radiated back into the surrounding space will be represented
by the retarded ﬁeld, i.e. the ﬁeld caused by the past charged distribution, or
caused by the past (electric) existence of the body, as shown in Figure 1.

So interpreting the advanced ﬁeld as an incoming energy (according to the
deﬁnition of the advanced Green’s function), and symmetrically the retarded
ﬁeld as an outgoing energy, and knowing that both ﬁelds depend on accelera-
tion of charges, we may generalize the statement: “an accelerating charge always
radiates energy”, to: accelerating charges always radiate or absorb energy. There
are two novel ideas here. One is that acceleration may indicate radiation or ab-
sorption, i.e. interaction [1], and the second is that the interaction is a collective

2

Figure 1: Advanced - incoming energy and retarded outgoing energy

process during which charges accumulate energy from a source and release it to
a destination, and not a single charge process by which a charge “radiates its
energy away”.

The known expression for the radiated power of a charged particle is P =
2/3q2aµaµ. For an on-shell particle, aµvµ ≡ 0, therefore we have the identity
aµaµ ≡ − ˙aµvµ. So the radiated power could be expressed as P = −2/3q2 ˙aµvµ.
Interactions always occur slightly oﬀ-shell [2] (example: if gravitation acts like
acceleration, and under the equivalence principle gravitation changes the metric,
acceleration should change the metric too), so during interactions the above on-
shell identity (aµaµ = − ˙aµvµ) is not exactly satisﬁed.

One should therefore ask which one of the two expressions represents better
the radiated power P ? It comes out that radiated power cannot come from
the charge itself, but from some source which boosted the charge (for example a
charge passing through a static electric ﬁeld will accelerate, by absorbing energy
from the static ﬁeld, and radiate it). We will show that while aµaµ is responsible
for the radiation, − ˙aµvµ is responsible for the energy absorption from the source,
and therefore the diﬀerence between them, aµaµ + ˙aµvµ, represents a transient
mass ﬂuctuation.

In Section 2 we present the main results of a previous work [3], in which we

3

analyzed the physical meaning of the self force on a charge which is part of a
radiating antenna. This self force was associated with the radiation resistance
of the antenna. We will bring here also some new insights and interpretations.
In Section 3 we develop the self force on a charge which is part of a radiating
or absorbing antenna. We will show here that while for the radiating case,
the self force generates the radiation resistance, for the impedance-matched
absorbing antenna the self force is responsible for the dissipated heat.

In Section 4 we present an open circuit antenna which receives a short energy
pulse from the surrounding space and radiates it back. We show that during the
interaction process, the antenna gains an addition of inertial mass which equals
the received energy, and loses the additional mass after radiation.

In Section 5, we explicitly show how the above mass gain has inertial prop-

erties.

2. SELF-FORCE ACTING AS RADIATION RESISTANCE

In a previous work [3] it has been shown that the so called “self force” Fself =
(2/3)q2 ˙a is responsible for the radiation resistance of an antenna. We will bring
in this section, for convenience, the main results of this work, plus some new
interpretations.

The following problem, of a driven short dipole antenna of length L, was

formulated:

Figure 2: Short dipole antenna

Given the fact that any time dependence can be expanded in a Fourier series
of functions, we consider the harmonic time dependence, as shown in Figure 2.
But the results we obtained for the ﬁelds are correct in general, and we use the
harmonic dependence only when calculating the radiation resistance, which is
indeed frequency dependent.

The z dependence of the current is disregarded, the antenna being short.

4

It comes out therefore that the motion parameters (velocity, acceleration,

and its derivative) of the charges have the form

v = v0 sin(ωt); a = ωv0 cos(ωt); ˙a = −ω2v0 sin(ωt)

(1)

By describing the conductor as a continuum of single charges, as in Figure
3, we examined the forces on the “test charge” B, as a result of a disturbance
produced on charge A. This disturbance is expressed in terms of the motion
parameters of charge A, i.e. the acceleration and its derivative.
The motion parameters are connected to the current via:

I = vρ = qv/∆z

(2)

where I is the electrical current and ρ is the free charge density of the
conductor. The discretization of the continuum into single charges is done by
deﬁning discrete charges of value q at distance ∆z so that q = ρ∆z, as in Figure
3. Furthermore, the velocity of the charges in a conductor is extremely small
(order of magnitude of 10−4m/sec).

and obtain R as Vself /I.
It is remarkable that the “self force”, calculated with the micro parameters,
shows up in macro to have the meaning of a damping power which is responsible
for the radiation resistance.

Up to here, we have given the main results of [3]. Let us now compare
between the “self power”, which was shown to act as damping power, and the
radiated power.

The power radiated by a (low velocity) charge is

Prad = (2/3)q2a2

(8)

The “self power” equals identically I 2R, so this is the power the current
source pumps. Therefore, it represents the power generated by the current
source, and pumped into the charges. On the other hand, the radiated power
represents the power which the charges release into space.

Using (1), we see that Pself = (2/3)q2(ωv0)2 cos2(ωt) and Prad = (2/3)q2(ωv0)2 sin2(ωt).

We remark that the energy over an entire cycle 2π/ω of both powers is identical,
so the energy is conserved in average, however there is a phase shift between
them, suggesting that the charges accumulate energy, before radiating it into
space.

Using (5) and (8), the power accumulated by the charges is

W = Pself −Prad = −(2/3)q2(a2+ ˙av) = −(2/3)q2(v0ω)2 cos(2ωt) ≡ −P0 cos(2ωt)

where P0 is easily shown to be equal to RI 2

Pself or Prad (which are equal up to a phase).

It is generally assumed that mass shell remains ﬁxed classically, and varies
only in quantum mechanics; we disagree because the on shell condition vµvµ =
−1 always imposes constraints which might contradict reality. For example it
imposes the constraint F µvµ = 0 for any force F µ = maµ in Newton’s law.

Therefore, interacting particles should not be completely on-shell [2], so we

will interpret (9) by considering the charges slightly oﬀ-shell:

6

vµvµ = −1 + v2

The reason for choosing the oﬀ-shell factor v2 will become clear later, and it
is to be mentioned that v2 ≪ 1, as we stated already. Taking the derivative of
the left side with respect to the proper time, and the derivative of the right side
with respect to the time (supposing time and proper time are almost equivalent),
we obtain:

(10)

(11)

where a = ˙v. By taking again the derivative, we obtain:

aµvµ = va

˙aµvµ + aλaλ = a2 + ˙av
The relativistic expression of the self force F µ

(12)
self = (2/3)q2( ˙aµ − aλaλvµ),
multiplied by the particle’s velocity vµ, results in identically 0 on-shell, but in
our case it gives:

F µ
self vµ = (2/3)q2( ˙aµvµ − aλaλvµvµ) ≃ (2/3)q2(a2 + ˙av)
The right side of (13) has been obtained using (12), and the fact that v ≪ 1.
We remark that F µ
self vµ = −W in (9). The mass of a radiating antenna is

therefore:

(14)
where M is the integration constant and represents the interaction-free mass

of the antenna, and Pef f = P0/2 represents the average radiated power.

It is obvious that the free mass is preserved in average, because we dealt
here with a stationary case of harmonic signal for which energy is pumped into
the charges and almost immediately radiated into the space.

The mass variation will be further examined in Section 4, for a short exci-

tation pulse.

3. ANTENNA ABSORBING ADVANCED FIELDS AND
RADIATING RETARDED FIELDS

The formulation here is quite similar to this in [3], and it is shown in Figure 4.
As we saw, the “self” retarded ﬁeld of a charge, acting on its neighbor,
generates for a radiating antenna a “self” voltage which, divided by the current
results in the radiation resistance.

It is therefore natural to analyze the “self” advanced ﬁeld of a charge, acting

on its neighbor, for an absorbing antenna.

We therefore derive the the retarded and advance ﬁeld on charge B, by the

motion of the disturbed charge A.

The ﬁrst term q/∆t2 is always cancelled by the force of the “other” neighbor,

it therefore can be completely ignored.

The third term is identical to what is considered to be the ﬁeld which creates
the retarded/advanced self-force of a charge, but here it was derived as the force
on a charge, due to a disturbance on a neighboring charge. As we shall see, it is
the only term which responsible for the radiation/absorption resistance (which
is a local phenomenon on the world line).

means that the current is “in phase” with its second derivative, and therefore the
ﬁrst part of ∆P in (38), integrated over time, represents radiated or absorbed en-
ergy. However, the multiplication of I by ∂I/∂t has the form of cos ω(t) sin ω(t)
and therefore the second part of ∆P represents a reactive power, which results
in zero energy after integrating on an integer number of time cycles. The re-
active power represents power which is returned to the source each time cycle.
We are therefore interested in the ﬁrst term of ∆P in (38).

We therefore obtain

Pself −ret/adv = ±

ω2(I∆z)2 = ∓(2/3)q2 ˙av

(39)

(compare with (5)). The radiation/absorption resistance is obtained by

Pself −ret/adv/I 2 or by the ﬁrst part of V in (34) divided by the current I:

Rrad/abs = ±(2/3)(2π)2(∆z/λ)2

(40)

The radiation resistance is the same as in (6), and the absorption resistance

is obviously its negative counterpart.

This is because a negative resistance −R through which a current I ﬂows is
completely equivalent to a current source I with an internal resistance R. If we
connect a load resistance of the same value R to this current source, as in the
right side of Figure 4, we get an impedance-matched absorbing antenna.

We proved here that the advanced ﬁeld behaves like an absorbed ﬁeld, and
knowing that the Poynting vector associated with the advanced ﬁeld is of the
same size and opposite direction as the Poynting vector associated with the
retarded ﬁeld, we may clearly state that the absorbed power is

Pabs = −(2/3)q2a2

(41)

(compare with (8)).
From here on we may follow the same arguments from Section 2, from (8) to
(14), and get the analogous results for an absorbing antenna, which are basically
the results for a radiating antenna, with sign changed.

The power accumulated by the charges is

W = Pself −adv−Pabs = (2/3)q2(a2+ ˙av) = (2/3)q2(v0ω)2 cos(2ωt) ≡ P0 cos(2ωt)
(42)
where P0 is the peak value of Pself or Pabs (which are equal up to a phase).
The mass of an absorbing antenna comes out to be

We see that the mass of an antenna is expressed via the integral on the self

force of its oﬀ-shell charges m(t) = −
self vµdτ , and the diﬀerence between
the radiating and absorbing cases is the sign. This sign diﬀerence is associated
R
with the fact that F µ

self −adv = −F µ

4. THE TRANSIENT FROM ABSORPTION TO RADI-
ATION

We saw in the Sections 2 and 3 that the mass of an antenna radiating or absorb-
ing an harmonic signal, oscillates harmonically at twice the radiating/absorbing
frequency.

The harmonic signal has no local time properties, hence the above results

cannot describe transients between emission and absorption.

We analyze here the case of an antenna of whose discretized charges have a
constant acceleration az for a short period of time 2∆t. As we saw in Section 3,
acceleration can indicate radiation or absorption, so we will consider the case
for which in the ﬁrst half of the acceleration duration (time from −∆t to 0)
there is absorption, and in the second half of the acceleration duration (time
from 0 to ∆t) there is radiation.

The retarded/advance ﬁeld due to a discretized charge in Figure 3 at the

location of its neighbor is given by the last 2 terms in (32):

neighbor.

Here we deﬁned the mass M as minus the product of two neighboring charges
over the distance between them. We shall see in Section 5 that such a conﬁgu-
ration of a pair of charges has inertial properties of magnitude −q1q/∆z, hence
when the charges are opposite in sign they behave like a positive mass, and vice
versa.

Actually our model in Figure 3 considered equal (free) charges in a conduc-
tor, but we know that for each negative charge there is a positive counterpart,
so we will consider for now M in (45) as positive: M ≡ q2/∆z.

We want to investigate the behavior of the dynamic mass change during the
interaction, i.e. from time −∆t to ∆t. For −∆t < t < 0, an absorption occurs,
therefore the lower sign has to be used, and for 0 < t < ∆t, the upper sign has
to be used.

A ﬁxed acceleration az means that if we go to the rest frame of the particle
by Lorentz transformation at any proper time, and measure the acceleration
in this frame, we always get the same result az. Under this deﬁnition, ˙a is not
identically 0. A ﬁxed accelerated motion, in the z direction may be parametrized
in the following way:

vµ(τ ) = (cosh(azτ ), 0, 0, sinh(azτ ))
aµ(τ ) = az(sinh(azτ ), 0, 0, cosh(azτ ))
˙aµ(τ ) = a2
z(cosh(azτ ), 0, 0, sinh(azτ ))

where the components of the 4-vectors are (t, x, y, z).
This low order approximation maintains the mass shell constraint [2] vµvµ =
−1, neglecting the v2 correction noted in (10). But we shall see below, that this
oﬀ-shell term will reappear.

In the framework of a conductor, we showed [3] that the velocity of the
charges is of order of magnitude of 10−4m/sec, hence v ≪ 1, so we have to
use the limit of (47)-(49) around the apex, up to ﬁrst order in τ (note that for
v ≪ 1, t ≃ τ )

vµ(τ ) ≃ (1, 0, 0, azt)
aµ(τ ) ≃ az(azt, 0, 0, 1)
˙aµ(τ ) ≃ a2
z(1, 0, 0, azt)

We remark that (50)-(52) satisfy the oﬀ-shell condition vµvµ = −1 + v2

deﬁned in (10).

We divide now the z component of ˙aµ, by the z component of aµ, to set it

in (46), and get for the absorption period −∆t < t < 0

m(t) = M (1 + (2/3)a2

zt∆z); −∆t < t < 0

and for the radiation period 0 < t < ∆t

m(t) = M (1 − (2/3)a2

zt∆z); 0 < t < ∆t

During the absorption period, there is a mass gain of (2/3)M a2

zt∆z, and

using M = q2/∆z, the mass gain is

m(0) − m(−∆t) = (2/3)q2a2

z∆t ≡ Pabsorbed∆t

(55)

and similarly, during the radiation period there is a mass loss, resulting in

a negative mass gain:

m(∆t) − m(0) = −(2/3)q2a2

z∆t ≡ −Pradiated∆t

(56)

We recognize in the expressions for the gain and lost of mass, the absorbed

and radiated energies, respectively, exhibiting energy conservation.

5. INERTIAL BEHAVIOR OF CHARGES

The analysis, done up to this point, was based on the discretization of an antenna
into equally spaced charges, attributing to a given charge micro parameters (v,
a, ˙a), connected to the antenna macro parameters, like I and V . We eventu-
ally considered for a short antenna, the distance between 2 charges ∆z, as a
representative length of the antenna.

With the aid of this model, we have succeeded to prove that the retarded
ﬁeld behaves like a radiated ﬁeld and the advanced ﬁeld behaves like an ab-
sorbed ﬁeld. We have shown that during radiation or absorption the mass of
the antenna (deﬁned as M ≡ q2/∆z), oscillates at twice the frequency.

When the antenna absorbs an energy pulse, the mass increases according
to the absorbed energy, and during the re-radiation of the pulse, the mass
decreases.

In the current section we wish to make a rigorous analysis to show that an
electrically reacting spacetime region has inertial properties. We model this
reacting spacetime region by an ideal electric dipole. We deﬁne here an ideal
dipole, as two equal and opposite charges at a distance d, so that for any possible
acceleration a of this system:

ad → 0

(57)

Note that ad is unitless, therefore condition (57) is well deﬁned. It means
that the distance between the charges is short enough for the largest possible
acceleration that may be considered.

The formulation is based on Figure 5
In Figure 5 the charges appear as q1 q2 but we will be eventually interested
in the case of q = q1 = −q2. The charges are bound, and they move together
on the z axis.

We calculate the ﬁeld on q2, caused by q1, in an inertial system in which q2

to the acceleration:

(77)

We deﬁned here M ≡ −q1q2/d, and dealing with q = q1 = −q2, M comes

out q2/d and is a positive quantity.

We remark that the conﬁguration deﬁned in Figure 5 cannot radiate, and
we see that it behaves like a simple constant mass. That is why we did not have

17

to bother whether to use retarded or advanced ﬁeld, and both ﬁelds gave the
same result (see remark after (71)). Another way of understanding this is by
the fact that F µ
self = (2/3)q2( ˙aµ − aλaλvµ) ≡ 0 for the world line described in
(60).

Now, does this mass represent inertia? Yes, because if some obstacle is put
in the way of the accelerating body, this obstacle will “feel” the force F = M az,
exactly as it will feel it for any non-electrical body of mass M. The obstacle
will be hit by an accelerating body, and will absorb the force azq2/d, hence the
dipole has inertial properties of magnitude q2/d.

However, the problem as exposed above, describing an accelerating dipole is
not completely deﬁned, because we must say what caused it to accelerate. But
we can look at it from a diﬀerent point of view: suppose we observed a static
dipole from a frame accelerating in the −z direction.

Any mass M that we observe from an accelerating system will appear to us
as being driven by an imaginary force (we call it imaginary aposteriori, knowing
we are not in an inertial system, but we observe it as a real force). In other
words, if the dipole would not have EM mass, we would not have observed the
force. And again, we can measure this mass by dividing the imaginary force F ,
in our case azq2/d by the acceleration az, and obtain M = q2/d.

6. DISCUSSION

The purpose of this work was to clarify the energy transfer process between
charged bodies and the world surrounding them.

We showed here that the “self” retarded ﬁeld of a charge, acting on its
neighbor, generates for a radiating antenna a “self” voltage which, divided by
the current results in the radiation resistance (R), and similarly the “self” ad-
vanced ﬁeld of a charge, acting on its neighbor, generates for an absorbing
matched antenna a “self” voltage which, divided by the current results in mi-
nus the radiation resistance (−R), i.e. acts like current source with internal
resistance R.

We showed also that the radiation process of an antenna consists of two en-
ergy transfer processes: energy transfer from the current source to the charges
(expressed by −2/3q2 ˙aµvµ), and energy transfer from the charges to the sur-
rounding space (expressed by 2/3q2aµaµ). Those two processes are not in phase,
and therefore the mass of the antenna ﬂuctuates at twice the radiation frequency.
Similarly, the absorption process of an antenna consists of two energy trans-
fer processes: energy transfer from the surrounding space to the charges, and
energy transfer from the charges to the resistive absorber. In this case the mass
of the antenna ﬂuctuates at twice the absorption frequency, too.

In a transient period between absorption and radiation, we found out that
during absorption the mass of the antenna increases by the amount of energy
absorbed, and during the radiation period the mass of the antenna decreases by
the amount of energy radiated.

Another interesting conclusion is that bound charges, always appearing in

nature as dipoles, are a manifestation of energy (inertia).

18

In a philosophical way, one may say that charge itself can be considered
as a manifestation of the interaction process. This may be understood in the
following way. From a macroscopic point of view, an antenna is completely
neutral in the absence of interaction. The charges of course exist all the time,
but they annihilate each other. During the interaction, the charges form dipoles,
and appear as mass ﬂuctuations.

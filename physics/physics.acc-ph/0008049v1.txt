MULTISCALE REPRESENTATIONS FOR SOLUTIONS OF

VLASOV-MAXWELL EQUATIONS FOR INTENSE BEAM PROPAGATION

Abstract
We present the applications of variational–wavelet ap-
proach for computing multiresolution/multiscale represen-
tation for solution of some approximations of Vlasov-
Maxwell equations.

INTRODUCTION

In this paper we consider the applications of a new numeri-
cal-analytical technique which is based on the methods of
local nonlinear harmonic analysis or wavelet analysis to the
nonlinear beam/accelerator physics problems described by
some forms of Vlasov-Maxwell (Poisson) equations. Such
approach may be useful in all models in which it is possi-
ble and reasonable to reduce all complicated problems re-
lated with statistical distributions to the problems described
by systems of nonlinear ordinary/partial differential equa-
tions. Wavelet analysis is a relatively novel set of math-
ematical methods, which gives us the possibility to work
with well-localized bases in functional spaces and gives for
the general type of operators (differential, integral, pseu-
dodifferential) in such bases the maximum sparse forms.
Our approach in this paper is based on the generalization
of variational-wavelet approach from [1]-[8], which allows
us to consider not only polynomial but rational type of non-
linearities [9]. The solution has the following form (related
forms in part 3)

u(t, x) = Xk∈Z n

V k(t) = V k,slow

N

U k(x) = U k,slow

N

j ∼ 2j

which corresponds to the full multiresolution expansion in
all time/space scales.

N

Formula (1) gives us expansion into the slow part uslow
and fast oscillating parts for arbitrary N. So, we may move
from coarse scales of resolution to the ﬁnest one for ob-
taining more detailed information about our dynamical pro-
cess. The ﬁrst term in the RHS of formulae (1) corresponds
on the global level of function space decomposition to reso-
lution space and the second one to detail space. In this way
we give contribution to our full solution from each scale
of resolution or each time/space scale. The same is correct
for the contribution to power spectral density (energy spec-
trum): we can take into account contributions from each

level/scale of resolution. Starting in part 2 from Vlasov-
Maxwell equations we consider in part 3 the generaliza-
tion of our approach based on variational formulation in
the biorthogonal bases of compactly supported wavelets.

Analysis based on the non-linear Vlasov-Maxwell equa-
tions leds to more clear understanding of the collecti-

3 VARIATIONAL APPROACH IN
BIORTHOGONAL WAVELET BASES

Now we consider some useful generalization of our varia-
tional wavelet approach. Because integrand of variational
functionals is represented by bilinear form (scalar product)
it seems more reasonable to consider wavelet constructions
[13] which take into account all advantages of this struc-
ture. The action functional for loops in the phase space is

F (γ) =Zγ

pdq −Z 1

0

H(t, γ(t))dt

(8)

The critical points of F are those loops γ, which solve the
Hamiltonian equations associated with the Hamiltonian H
and hence are periodic orbits. Let us consider the loop
space Ω = C∞(S 1, R2n), where S 1 = R/Z, of smooth
loops in R2n. Let us deﬁne a function Φ : Ω → R by
setting

1
2

Φ(x) =Z 1

< −J ˙x, x > dt −Z 1

x ∈ Ω
(9)
Computing the derivative at x ∈ Ω in the direction of y ∈
Ω, we ﬁnd

H(x(t))dt,

0

0

Φ′(x)(y) =Z 1

0

< −J ˙x − ▽H(x), y > dt

(10)

Consequently, Φ′(x)(y) = 0 for all y ∈ Ω iff the loop x is
a solution of the Hamiltonian equations. Now we need to
take into account underlying bilinear structure via wavelets.
We started with two hierarchical sequences of approxima-
tions spaces [13]: . . . V−2 ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V2 . . . ,

Vj ⊥ fWj ,

ally, W0 is complement to V0 in V1, but now not neces-
sarily orthogonal complement. New orthogonality condi-

. . .eV−2 ⊂ eV−1 ⊂ eV0 ⊂ eV1 ⊂ eV2 . . . , and as usu-
tions have now the following form: fW0 ⊥ V0, W0 ⊥
eV0,
eVj ⊥ Wj translates of ψ span W0,
translates of ˜ψ span fW0. Biorthogonality conditions
are < ψjk, ˜ψj ′k′ >= R ∞

−∞ ψjk(x) ˜ψj ′k′ (x)dx = δkk′ δjj ′ ,
where ψjk(x) = 2j/2ψ(2jx−k). Functions ϕ(x), ˜ϕ(x−k)
form dual pair: < ϕ(x − k), ˜ϕ(x − ℓ) >= δkl, <
ϕ(x − k), ˜ψ(x − ℓ) >= 0 for ∀k, ∀ℓ. Functions ϕ, ˜ϕ
generate a multiresolution analysis. ϕ(x − k), ψ(x − k)
are synthesis functions, ˜ϕ(x − ℓ), ˜ψ(x − ℓ) are analysis
functions. Synthesis functions are biorthogonal to analysis
functions. Scaling spaces are orthogonal to dual wavelet
spaces. Two multiresolutions are intertwining Vj + Wj =
Vj+1,
orthogonal sums. So, our representation for solution has
now the form

eVj +fWj = eVj+1. These are direct sums but not

f (t) =Xj,k

˜bjkψjk(t),

wavelets. Biorthogonality yields

˜bℓm =Z f (t) ˜ψℓm(t)dt.

(12)

So, now we can introduce this more useful construction
into our variational approach. We have modiﬁcation only
on the level of computing coefﬁcients of reduced nonlinear
algebraical system. This new construction is more ﬂexi-
ble. Biorthogonal point of view is more stable under the ac-
tion of large class of operators while orthogonal (one scale
for multiresolution) is fragile, all computations are much
more simpler and we accelerate the rate of convergence. In
all types of (Hamiltonian) calculation, which are based on
some bilinear structures (symplectic or Poissonian struc-
tures, bilinear form of integrand in variational integral) this
framework leads to greater success.

So, we try to use wavelet bases with their good spatial
and scale–wavenumber localization properties to explore
the dynamics of coherent structures in spatially-extended,
’turbulent’/stochastic systems. After some ansatzes and re-
ductions we arrive from (2),(3) or (5)-(7) to some system of
nonlinear partial differential equations [10]. We consider
application of our technique to Kuramoto-Sivashiinsky
equation as a model with rich spatio-temporal behaviour
[14] (0 ≤ x ≤ L,
u(0, t) = u(L, t),
ux(0, t) = ux(L, t)):

Then in contrast to [14] we apply to (16) methods from [1]-
[9] and arrive to formula (1). The same approach we use
for the general nonlinear wave equation

u(t, x) = S(x − vt)

and methods [1]-[10] led to formulae (1). Resulting mul-
tiresolution/multiscale representation in the high-localized
bases (Fig.1) is demonstrated on Fig.2, Fig.3. We would
like to thank Professor James B. Rosenzweig and Mrs.
Melinda Laraneta for nice hospitality, help and support dur-
ing UCLA ICFA Workshop.

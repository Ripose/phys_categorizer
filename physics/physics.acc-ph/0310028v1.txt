Abstract. A 4600 Hz pulsed synchrotron is considered as a means of accelerating cool muons with
superconducting RF cavities from 4 to 20 GeV/c for a neutrino factory. Eddy current losses are held
to less than a megawatt by the low machine duty cycle plus 100 micron thick grain oriented silicon
steel laminations and 250 micron diameter copper wires. Combined function magnets with 20 T/m
gradients alternating within single magnets form the lattice. Muon survival is 83%.

Historically synchrotrons have provided economical particle acceleration. Here we
consider a pulsed muon synchrotron [1] for a neutrino factory [2]. The accelerated
muons are stored in a racetrack to produce neutrino beams (m − → e− n e n
and
m + → e+ n e n
m ). Neutrino oscillations have been observed at experiments [3] such as
Homestake, Super–Kamiokande, SNO, and KamLAND. Further exploration using a
neutrino factory could reveal CP violation in the lepton sector [4].

m

This synchrotron must accelerate muons from 4 to 20 GeV/c with moderate decay
loss (t m ± = 2.2 m S), using magnet power supplies with reasonable voltages. To reduce
voltage, magnet gaps are minimized to store less magnetic energy. Cool muons [5]
with low beam emittance allow this. Acceleration to 4 GeV/c might feature ﬁxed ﬁeld
dogbone arcs [6, 7] to minimize muon decay loss. Fast ramping synchrotrons [6, 8]
might also accelerate very cool muons to higher energies for a m + m − collider [9].

Quadrupoles

FIGURE 1.

SC cavities

Combined function magnets

We form arcs with sequences of combined function cells within continuous long
magnets, whose poles are alternately shaped to give focusing gradients of each sign.
A cell has been simulated using SYNCH [10]. Gradients alternate from positive 20 T/m
gradient (2.24 m long), to zero gradient (.4 m long) to negative 20 T/m gradient (2.24
m) to zero gradient (0.4 m), etc. See Fig. 1 and Table 1. It is proposed to use 5 such
arc cells to form an arc segment. These segments are alternated with straight sections
containing RF. The phase advance through one arc segment is 5 x 720 = 3600. This
being so, dispersion suppression between straights and arcs can be omitted. There are
18 arc segments and 18 straight sections, forming 18 superperiods in the ring. Straight

sections (22 m) without dispersion are used for superconducting RF, and, in two longer
straights (44 m), the injection and extraction. To assure sufﬁciently low magnetic ﬁelds
at the cavities, relatively long ﬁeld free regions are desirable. A straight consisting of
two half cells would allow a central gap of 10 m between quadrupoles, and two smaller
gaps at the ends. Details are given in Table 3. Matching between the arcs and straights
is not yet designed. The total circumference of the ring including combined functions
magnets and straight sections adds up to 917 m (18 × 26.5 + 16 × 22 + 2 × 44).

The superconducting RF (see Fig. 1 and Table 2 and note that 11 MV/m has been
achieved so far [11]) must be distributed around the ring to avoid large differences
between the beam momentum (which rises in steps at each RF section) and the magnetic
ﬁeld (which rises continuously). The amount of RF is a tradeoff between cost and muon
survival. Time dilation permits extra orbits with little muon decay if the RF sags.

The muons accelerate from 4 to 20 GeV. If they are extracted at 95% of full ﬁeld they
will be injected at 19% of full ﬁeld. For acceleration with a plain sine wave, injection
occurs at 110 and extraction occurs at 720. So the phase must change by 610 in 37 m S.
Thus the sine wave goes through 3600 in 218 m sec, giving 4600 Hz.

Estimate the energy stored in each 26.5 m long combined function magnet. The gap
is about .14 m wide and has an average height of h = .06 m. Assume an average ﬁeld of

estimate current, inductance, capacitance, and voltage.

C = 120 kV (2)
The stack of SCRs driving each coil might be center tapped to halve the 120 kV. Nine
equally spaced 6 cm coil slots could be created in the top and bottom of each yoke
using 6 cm of taller laminations to cut the voltage by ten, while leaving the pole faces
continuous. 6 kV is easier to insulate than 120 kV. It will be useful to shield [1] and/or
chamfer [13] magnet ends to avoid large eddy currents where the ﬁeld lines typically do
not follow laminations. Neutrino horn power supplies are of interest.

Calculate the resistive energy loss in the copper coils. There are two 5 cm square
copper conductors each 5300 cm long. R = 5300 (1.8 m
. So,

0 cos2(q ) dq = 260 000 w/magnet. Eighteen magnets give a total loss of 4680
P = I2R
kW. But the neutrino factory runs at 30 Hz. Thirty half cycles of 109 m sec per second
gives a duty factor of 300 and a total I2R loss of 16 kW. Muons are orbited in opposite
directions on alternate cycles. If this proves too cumbersome, the duty cycle factor could
be lowered to 150. See if .25 mm (30 gauge) wire is usable. The skin depth [14], d , of
copper at 4600 Hz is (r / p

f m 0)1/2 = (1.8 × 10−8 / p 4600 m 0)1/2 = 0.97 mm.

R

Now calculate the dissipation due to eddy currents [15] in a w = .25 mm wide
conductor, which consists of transposed strands to reduce this loss [13, 15]. To get
an idea, take the maximum B-ﬁeld during a cycle to be that generated by a 0.025m
radius conductor carrying 26 kA. The eddy current loss in a conductor made of square
wires .25 mm wide (Litz wire [16]) with a perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld is as follows.

Multiply by 18 magnets and divide by a duty factor of 300 to get an eddy current
loss in the copper of 85 kW. Stainless steel water cooling tubes will dissipate a similar
amount of power [6]. Alloy titanium cooling tubes would dissipate half as much.

Grain oriented silicon steel is chosen for the yoke due to its high permeability at
high ﬁeld at noted in Table 4. The skin depth [14], d , of a lamination is (r / p
f m )1/2
is resistivity. Take m = 1000m 0 as a

limit on magnetic saturation and hence energy storage in the yoke. Next estimate the
fraction of the yoke inductance that remains after eddy currents shield the lamina-
tions [17]. The lamination thickness, t, is 100 m m [18]. L/L0 = (d /t) (sinh(t/d ) +
sin(t/d )) / (cosh(t/d ) + cos(t/d )) = 0.995. So it appears that magnetic ﬁelds can pene-
trate 100 m m thick laminations at 4600 Hz. Thicker 175 m m laminations [12] would be
half as costly and can achieve a bit higher packing fraction. L/L0(t = 175 m m) = 0.956.
Do the eddy current losses [15] in the 100 m m thick iron laminations. Use equation
3 with a quarter meter square area, a 26.5 m length, and an average ﬁeld of 1.1 Tesla.
P = [(26.5) (.52)] (2p 2600 1.1 .0001)2/[(24) 47 × 10−8] = 5900 kW. Multiply by 18

W
magnets and divide by a duty factor of 300 to get an eddy current loss in the iron
laminations of 350 kW or 700 watts/m of magnet. So the iron will need some cooling.
The ring only ramps 30 times per second, so the
H·d B hysteresis losses will be low,
even more so because of the low coercive force (Hc = 0.1 Oersteds) of grain oriented
silicon steel. This value of Hc is eight times less than 1008 low carbon steel.

R

The low duty cycle of the neutrino factory leads to eddy current losses of less than a
megawatt in a 4600 Hz, 917 m circumference ring. Gradients are switched within dipoles
to minimize eddy current losses in ends. Muon survival is 83%.

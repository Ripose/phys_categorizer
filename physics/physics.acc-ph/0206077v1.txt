Rotating Metal Band Target for Pion Production
at Muon Colliders and Neutrino Factories

January 10, 2014

Abstract

A conceptual design is presented for a high power pion production
target for muon colliders that is based on a rotating metal band. Three
candidate materials are considered for the target band: Inconel alloy 718,
titanium alloy 6Al-4V (grade 5) and nickel. A pulsed proton beam tan-
gentially intercepts a chord of the target band that is inside a 20 tesla
tapered solenoidal magnetic pion capture channel similar to designs pre-
viously considered for muon colliders and neutrino factories. The target
band has a radius of 2.5 meters and is continuously rotated at approxi-
mately 1 m/s to carry heat away from the production region and into a
water cooling tank. The mechanical layout and cooling setup of the tar-
get are described, including the procedure for the routine replacement of
the target band. A rectangular band cross section is assumed, optionally
with I-beam struts to enhance stiﬀness and minimize mechanical vibra-
tions. Results are presented from realistic MARS Monte Carlo computer
simulations of the pion yield and energy deposition in the target and from
ANSYS ﬁnite element calculations for the corresponding shock heating
stresses. The target scenario is predicted to perform satisfactorily and
with conservative safety margins for multi-MW pulsed proton beams.

1 Introduction and Overview

The design of a pion production target for a muon collider or neutrino fac-
tory is challenging because of the combination of high average power and large
instantaneous energy depositions from the pulsed proton beam, the geometric
constraints from the capture solenoid surrounding the target, and the desire to
maximize the pion yield through use of transversely thin targets constructed
from elements with high, or at least medium, atomic numbers.

Other target options that have previously been considered for either muon
colliders or neutrino factories include liquid mercury jets [1, 2, 3] and a radiation

A plan view of the targetry setup for the band target option is shown in

magnetic capture channel to tangentially intercept the proton beam. Three
metals are considered as candidates for the target band:

slight modiﬁcation of a previously presented conceptual design [2, 3], as will be
discussed further in section 6.

The proton beam enters the center of the target band webbing at a glancing
angle, and the beam center traverses approximately two interaction lengths of

of the band. The cross sectional dimensions of the band and its orientation
relative to the proton beam are shown in ﬁgures 2 and 3; the speciﬁcations of the
band and the proton beam dimensions are enumerated in table 1. Inconel and
nickel were studied for identical band dimensions and proton beam parameters,
whereas the titanium alloy band was thicker, with no I-beam ﬂanges required
for stiﬀness, and used a larger proton beam spot. The circulating band is
cooled by passage through a water tank located in a separate radiation-shielded
maintenance enclosure.

The sections in this paper discuss, in order: 1) the range of expected proton
beam parameters, 2) the properties of the candidate target materials and the
speciﬁcations of the target band, 3) the drive and support rollers for the target
band, 4) considerations for operating the target region in an air environment, 5)
required modiﬁcations to the pion capture and decay channel in order to incor-
porate the rotating band, 6) cooling of the band in a water tank, 7) radiation
damage and the replacement scheme for the target band, 8) MARS Monte Carlo
simulations of pion yield and the beam energy deposition distribution, 9) beam-
induced shock heating stresses on the target band, and 10) overall conclusions
on the rotating band target design scenario.

2 Incident Proton Beam Speciﬁcations

Pion sources for muon colliders have similar requirements to those for the related
technology of neutrino factories. However, there is a greater emphasis on high
charge proton bunches because, for high luminosity muon collider parameters,
the produced pion cloud must eventually be transformed into muon bunches
containing at least 1011−12 muons per bunch at collision. This implies larger
instantaneous stresses in the target.

In order to design for the most challenging shock stresses at muon colliders,
the modeling for this paper is benchmarked to the largest proton bunch charge
normally considered [2] at collision: 4 × 1012 muons per bunch; pion yield sim-
ulations for each target are ﬁrst used to normalize the incident proton bunch
charge to this capture rate. On working backwards to the number of pions and
muons captured from the target, an assumed 25% survival rate [2] through the
cooling channel and acceleration implies initially capturing a total of 3.2 × 1013
pions and muons, where the two charge signs have been summed.

As an aside, it is noted that this benchmarking procedure makes no as-
sumption on whether or not the pion capture and decay channel is capable of
capturing both charge signs in practice – a capability that seems plausible but
has yet to be demonstrated in muon collider design studies – because the same
proton bunch charge will be required in either case, and it is instead the bunch
repetition rate that must be doubled if only one pion sign is collected at a time.
The bunch repetition rate is less critical than the proton bunch charge vis-
a-vis instantaneous shock stresses because, as section 10 will show, the shock
waves die down quickly enough for the bunches to be relatively independent in
any reasonable muon collider bunch scenario.

For a given proton bunch charge, the additional speciﬁcation of the bunch
repetition rate determines the average proton beam power, some fraction of
which will be deposited as heat in the target band and will need to be removed
in the cooling tank. Proton beam powers of up to 7 MW [1] have been assumed
for some muon collider scenarios; 4 MW is a commonly-assumed value [2]. Con-
straints on the muon beam currents from neutrino radiation may dictate less
powerful proton drivers for many-TeV muon colliders. Design studies [4, 3] for
neutrino factories have also assumed proton driver powers reaching the 1–4 MW
level.

It will be seen in section 7 that the target cooling requirements are rather
relaxed even for such proton beam powers. This is due to the band rotation
spreading the heat load around the band circumference and to the large band
surface area exposed to the cooling water. Therefore, the band target is unlikely
in practice to set a limit on the average proton beam power.

Pion yield per proton is nearly proportional to proton energy, with lower
proton energies slightly preferred in the multi-GeV energy range; equivalently,
yield per MW of proton beam power falls slowly with increasing proton energy.
As a competing concern, higher proton energies more easily enable the proton
bunch lengths of 3 ns or less that are optimal for a capture and decay channel
that provides eﬃcient capture of the muons into rf acceleration while retaining

5

substantial muon polarization. We consider two representative proton energies,
6 GeV and 24 GeV, in order to allow interpolation.

For the band target design discussed here, the proton beam is incident at
a horizontal angle of 100 milliradians to the symmetry axis of the solenoidal
magnet capture channel (to maximize the pion yield) and is focused to an ellip-
tical beam spot at the target interaction region with assumed gaussian proﬁles
in both transverse dimensions and with r.m.s. spot sizes tuned for acceptable
shock heating stresses for the given proton beam parameters and band mate-
rial. The stress and yield simulations assumed r.m.s. proton spot sizes of 2 mm
(horizontal) and 15 mm (vertical) incident on the Inconel and nickel bands, and
5 mm (horizontal) by 10 mm (vertical) for the titanium alloy band.

The relevant properties of each of the 3 candidate target band materials –
Inconel alloy 718, titanium alloy 6Al-4V grade 5 and nickel – are summarized
in table 2.

Inconel 718 [9] is a niobium-modiﬁed nickel-chromium-iron superalloy that
was developed for aerospace applications. Attractive properties include high
strength, outstanding weldability, resistance to creep-rupture and resistance to
corrosion from air and water. It is used in high radiation environments such
as the core internals of light-water nuclear reactors; examples of applications
at accelerators include high intensity proton beam windows and as the water-
containment material for proton beam degraders.
It was proposed for beam
windows and for cladding the tungsten target elements in the 170 MW proton

6

beam at the Accelerator Tritium Production (ATP) project (now part of the
Advanced Accelerator Applications initiative) and is the back-up candidate (be-
hind 316LN stainless steel) for the construction of Spallation Neutron Source
(SNS) target components.

The elemental composition of Inconel alloy 718 that was used for pion yield
calculations is [9] (with percentage by weight then molar fraction in the brack-
ets): Ni (54.3%, 0.537), Cr (19.0%, 0.212), Fe (17.0%, 0.177), Nb (5.1%, 0.032),
Mo (3.1%, 0.019), Ti (0.9%, 0.011), Al (0.6%, 0.013).

The titanium alloy under consideration is titanium 6Al-4V (Grade 5), con-
sisting of titanium alloyed with 6% aluminum and 4% vanadium by weight. This
high-strength alpha-beta alloy is among the most versatile and widely used of
the titanium alloys. Applications include in pumps, valves, turbines, aerospace
and automotive parts, and vessels and casings where corrosion is an issue. It
oﬀers ready machinability and, unlike some alpha-beta titanium alloys, is not
greatly embrittled by welding. Titanium and titanium alloys have been used in
production targets, and this particular alloy was recommended [10] after use in
beam windows at CERN.

Table 2 shows nickel to have by far the lowest yield strength and fatigue
strength of the three material options. However, nickel targets seem to evade
these low-strength predictions, with successful operation in high power pulsed
proton beams. For example, the currently operating nickel target [13] at the Fer-
milab antiproton source has absorbed peak energy depositions of up to 600 J/g
over 2.4 microseconds, corresponding to an impressive 1100oC temperature rise.
It has been speculated that such nickel targets survive because they can self-
anneal in high power target environments, although the actual reason for their
exceptional performance is not well understood.

As a concern for nickel targets, it was the experience of both the FNAL anti-
proton target [13] and BNL g-2 nickel target [14, 15] that the nickel surfaces
slowly deteriorated and eventually began to powder on timespans of order one
year. The implications of this for the target replacement lifetime and possible
radioactive contamination would need to be addressed for a muon collider target
scenario. Also, its much higher electrical conductivity will cause greater drag
on the target band from magnetic eddy currents in the capture magnet. On
the other hand, it will be seen that nickel’s pion yield is predicted to be slightly
better than Inconel and signiﬁcantly better than titanium alloy, so it may well
be an attractive option for muon collider scenarios with low repetition rate
proton beam parameters where the beam-induced damage will be minimized or
eliminated and the band can be rotated more slowly to reduce the magnetic
eddy currents.

The requirements for a tightly focussed proton beam spot on the target
are more relaxed than, e.g., for an anti-proton production target because any
contribution from the spot size to the produced pion beam emittance will tend
to get washed out when the pions decay to muons. The dimensions of the band
webbing and proton beam spot were chosen to approximately maximize the
pion yield while keeping the density of energy depositions in the target to an
acceptably low level. General requirements for yield are that the proton path

7

length through the target material should be [2, 16] approximately 1.5–2 nuclear
interaction lengths, and that the band should be thin enough to allow most of
the pions to escape the target. It is predicted [1, 16] that high atomic number
(high-Z) or medium-Z elements are favored over low-Z elements for the higher
end of the considered range of proton energies; this advantage is less marked at
lower proton energies. Inconel, titanium alloy and nickel can all be considered
to fall within the category of medium-Z materials.

Tilting targets by approximately 100 milliradians with respect to the capture
solenoid has generally also been found [2, 16] to slightly increase the pion yield.
The elliptical beam spot was chosen solely to reduce the beam-induced stress
by spreading out the beam energy deposition within the target.

4 Target Band Drive and Support Mechanism

The target band rotates at of order 1 m/s, depending on the target material and
proton beam parameters, and with a rotation sense away from the proton beam
direction. Faster rotation minimizes heating pile-up from successive proton
pulses but the mechanical drive power must increase as the square of the rotation
velocity in order to compensate for eddy current drag in the 20 tesla solenoid.
As a numerical example of eddy current forces, it can be roughly estimated
that several hundred watts of drive power would be required to overcome the
eddy current forces from an Inconel band with the given cross-section and ro-
tating at 1 m/s. According to the ratio of electrical conductivities in table 2,
the eddy current power for this scenario would be be 14/0.8 = 18 times worse
if a nickel band was used instead of Inconel.

The band is guided and driven by several sets of rollers located around its
circumference, as is shown in ﬁgure 1. The motive power is most conveniently
applied from those rollers within the maintenance tunnel, where the radiation
environment is less severe and maintenance is easier. For most proton beam
parameters, the eddy current drag will not be large enough to require toothing
the rollers and the parts of the band they contact. The tightest position toler-
ances on the rollers are the precisions of 1 mm or better required for the rollers
deﬁning the band’s horizontal position at interaction with the beam.

Following the design of the BNL g-minus-2 target [14], the roller assemblies
will all incorporate self-lubricating graphalloy [17] bushings. These commer-
cially available bushings are manufactured from molded graphite impregnated
with metal and, in contrast to oil-based lubricants, are compatible with high
radiation environments.

5 Considerations for Targetry in an Air Envi-

ronment

The pion production region of the target is in an air environment. This simpliﬁes
target maintenance and target band replacement by avoiding any requirement

8

to break and re-establish seals in a high radiation environment.

The vacuum window for the proton beam-line is located immediately down-
stream from the ﬁnal quadrupole magnet and a few meters upstream from the
production region. The proton beam spot size at this beam window will be much
larger than for the focused beam at the target interaction region; this minimizes
the peak beam-heating stresses and radiation damage in the window and also
simpliﬁes the window cooling. The vacuum in the pion decay channel begins at
a beam window located (e.g.) 6 meters downstream from the target interaction
region. These distances are not expected to result in either excessive proton-
air interactions upstream from the target or signiﬁcant degradation of the pion
yield since each meter of air corresponds to only 0.13 g/cm2 of matter, 0.14%
of an interaction length, 0.33% of a radiation length and to a minimum-ionizing
energy loss of only 0.24 MeV.

Following the procedure adopted for the BNL g-minus-2 target [14], activated
air and gases from the target and interaction region are continuously diluted
and vented from the target hall into the outside atmosphere. Initially, a loosely
airtight container around the target impedes gas transport away from the target
until most short-lived radio-isotopes have decayed. The iron plug shown in
ﬁgure 1 may suﬃce for this purpose. The activated air is then transported
along the target hall to allow dilution by mixing with unactivated air until
acceptable activation levels are reached for venting into the outside atmosphere.

6 The Pion Capture and Decay Channel

The pion capture channel in ﬁgure 1 represents only a slight variation on chan-
nels considered previously [2, 4, 3]. The magnetic ﬁeld in the solenoidal capture
channel is nearly identical to that in previous studies. As a minor change, no re-
quirement remains for ﬁeld homogeneity upstream from the production region,
so no there is no constraint on how the upstream ﬁeld rises to the 20 tesla max-
imum. On the other hand, the third coil block downstream from the upstream
end had to be moved outwards by approximately 10 centimeters to provide ad-
equate space for the band to exit the channel. A modest re-optimization of the
coil currents was required to restore the magnetic ﬁeld map in this region to
the speciﬁcations of the previous studies. The coil block positions and dimen-
sions shown in ﬁgure 1 are taken directly from the computer programs used
to optimize the magnet geometry and magnetic ﬁeld proﬁle. The re-optimized
magnetic ﬁeld map is shown in ﬁgure 4.

The other requirement on the capture and decay channel that is additional
to previous scenarios is the provision of entry and exit ports for the target
band. The design of these ports is simpliﬁed by the air environment of the
pion production region. The entry port need only traverse the iron plug in the
upstream end of the capture solenoid. The downstream port is more challenging
since it must traverse the tungsten-based radiation shielding and then pass
between the solenoidal magnet coil blocks and out of the pion decay channel.

If it is considered undesirable to incorporate such an exit port into a single

cryostat, then the alternative option exists of breaking the cryostat longitudi-
nally into two cryostats, so that the band can exit between them. The exit port
likely will require some cladding with, e.g., tungsten carbide and water, in order
to shield the magnet coils from any additional radiation load from low-energy
neutrons.

As is clear from ﬁgure 1, the target band exit port is far enough upstream
from the beam dump for it to be essentially irrelevant in the beam dump design.
Therefore, the beam dump design can be similar to that of reference [18].

7 Target Cooling

The heated portion of the band rotates through a 2 meter long cooling tank
whose conceptual design is shown in Fig. 5.

The water ﬂows due to the gravitational head in a feeder tank, with the
band entrance and exit ports in the ends of the tank also serving as the water
outlets. The ﬂow rate can be simply adjusted by varying the head in the feeder
tank. Guides in the ports steer the water oﬀ to the side of the target band and
into a drain, to then be pumped through a chiller and recirculated. The drains
and structure at the ends of the tank will be covered with hoods to prevent

10

Figure 5: A conceptual illustration of the target cooling setup. A target band
with an I-beam cross section is shown, as has been assumed for the nickel and
Inconel 718 material options. A similar but simpliﬁed design would apply for
the assumed rectangular cross section of titanium alloy bands.

splashing (not shown in ﬁgure 5) and, at the end where the band exits, high
pressure air will blow the residual water oﬀ the wetted band as it exits the hood.
For equilibrium, the heat removed must balance the fraction of the proton
beam power deposited as heat in the band, which MARS Monte Carlo computer
simulations found to be approximately 7% (see section 9), i.e., approximately
70 kW of heat deposited in the target band per megawatt of beam power.

The 2 meter length of water in the cooling tank was chosen to be suﬃ-
cient to obviate the need for forced convection of the cooling water for proton
beam powers up to several MW, while many-MW proton beam powers could be
contemplated by incorporating forced convection and/or increasing the cooling
tank length. For the example of the I-beam cross section for Inconel or nickel,
the 0.69 square meters of immersed target band surface area corresponds to an
average heat transfer rate of 10 W/cm2 per megawatt of beam power. Even for
proton beam powers up to several megawatts, this will be comfortably below
the 100 W/cm2 approximate maximum sustainable rate for cooling by nucleate-
boiling with standing water under favorable conditions. The cross section of the
titanium band is 70% as large, so the heat transfer rates would need to be about
40% higher.

The water ﬂow rate parameters are also relatively modest. For example,
an assumed 5 degree centigrade average temperature rise in the water would

11

require an exit ﬂow rate of about 3.3 liters per second per megawatt of incident
beam power. In the approximation that viscosity is neglected, this ﬂow rate
could be met by a combination of 1) a 2 m/s ﬂow velocity supplied by pressure
from a 20 cm head of water and 2) an 18 cm2 cross-sectional area per megawatt
of beam power in each of the 2 exit ports around the cross section of the target
band.

Concerning the desirability of drying the target between its multiple passages
through the cooling tank and subsequent exposures to the beam, it is noted that
this was not considered necessary for the BNL g-2 rotating-disk production
target [14], which was simply left wet. However, the motivation for air-drying is
stronger for the geometry, drive mechanism and larger local temperature rises
of the rotating band target considered here, and so it is assumed that drying air
jets are included in the design. As well as drying the bulk surface area, it should
be relatively straightforward to shape the air ﬂow to also remove all or almost
all the water from the transverse gaps between the 8 circumferential sections of
the band and from the 3 circumferential stress-barrier grooves at both the top
and bottom of the webbing.

As an attractive feature for maintenance, all equipment for the cooling loop
that requires moving parts – the pumps, chiller, valves for the feeder tank,
and air compressor – can be conveniently located either inside the maintenance
tunnel or entirely outside the shielding walls surrounding the target hall.

8 Radiation Damage and Target Band Replace-

ment

The rotation of the target band has the desirable dilution eﬀect that the rate
of radiation damage on any particular section of the band material is reduced
by roughly two orders of magnitude relative to a ﬁxed target geometry, because
the region of maximum energy deposition from any particular proton bunch has
a characteristic width on the order of one interaction length (i.e. 15–28 cm),
whereas the 15.7 meter band circumference corresponds to 55–100 interaction
lengths, depending on the target material. Even so, the strength and other
mechanical properties of the target band will likely eventually be degraded by
repeated shock heating stresses and radiation damage to the point where the
band needs to be replaced. Therefore, the target design must allow for the
routine removal and replacement of the target band.

A very approximate determination of radiation damage to the target band
can be obtained from the estimated ﬂuence of particles through the target mate-
rial and the rule-of-thumb that 1 displacement per atom (dpa) will be produced
by a ﬂuence 1021 minimum ionizing particles per square centimeter. This pre-
dicts that a few-MW proton beam would produce of order 1 displacement per
atom (dpa) per year of radiation damage. In turn, this suggests that annual
replacement of the band should easily suﬃce even for the highest power proton
beams under consideration since, for comparison, a 6 dpa design lifetime has

12

been set for the 316LN steel (or Inconel 718, as a back-up) target components
in the SNS.

Welds can be a potential Achilles heel for high-stress targetry applications.
Favorable features for the rotating band target geometry in this regard are that
no welds are required between dissimilar metals and that the welds can be
placed at the top and bottom of the band webbing, away from the mid-height
region that receives the beam energy. For further protection, circumferential
grooves placed inside the welds can mechanically isolate them from shock waves
emanating from the beam interactions. A welding scenario incorporating such
grooves is shown in ﬁgure 6.

With three grooves inside each weld, as shown in ﬁgure 6, the shock waves
emanating from the target region will be almost entirely reﬂected back into the
central region or else dissipated by multiple scatters. This will eﬀectively shield
the weld from the shock-heating transients.

Because the band is not load-bearing, each of the grooves can extend nearly
through the thickness of the webbing, and they are assumed to run all the way
around the band circumference. The removal of material away from the mid-
height production region should be irrelevant, or perhaps even slightly beneﬁcial,
to the pion yield.

The join region can be blown dry after exiting the cooling tank. A few-
millimeter gap might well be retained in the joins between the 8 circumferential
band segments, in order to avoid leaving small cracks that could retain water
by capillary action after passage through the cooling tank. Such gaps will have
a negligible eﬀect on the pion yield for those proton pulses passing through
the join regions, since they represent only of order a one percent reduction in
the eﬀective target length. The yield is insensitive to such small changes near
the optimal beam intersection length because, by deﬁnition, the optimal beam
intersection length for yield occurs where the ﬁrst derivative of yield with respect
to length is zero.

Each of the candidate band materials is suitable for welding. Inconel 718
gives outstanding weldability [9] and resistance to post-weld cracking. Ti-6Al-
4V is among the better alpha-beta titanium alloys for welding [19] and is weld-
able in the annealed condition as well as in the solution-treated and partially-
aged conditions.

Target bands will be installed and extracted from the dedicated band mainte-
nance area located in the maintenance tunnel (see ﬁgure 1). Remote extraction
is presumably the only viable option for heavily irradiated used bands. The band
will be removed from its channel by progressively clamping and then shearing
oﬀ (e.g.) 1 meter lengths and dropping them into a hot box. It is expected that,
once the hot box has been locked shut and the irradiated band removed to a
disposal area, radiation levels in the maintenance tunnel will have fallen to an
acceptably low level to allow the immediate manual installation of the new band
without the need for a cool-down period. This assumption should eventually
be checked using particle tracking simulations (e.g. with MARS [20]) that can
determine the level of residual radiation carried into the maintenance area by
the target band and by neutrons leaking through the band ports in the shield-

13

ing wall, although these levels are expected to be similar to those calculated in
reference [18].

In what is almost the reverse procedure to band removal, the new band will
be progressively welded together in situ from (e.g.) eight 1.96 meter long chords
of target band that have been previously formed into the correct cross section
and circumferential curvature.

Full MARS [20] tracking and showering Monte Carlo simulations were con-
ducted for 6 GeV and 24 GeV protons incident on the target, returning predic-
tions for the pion yield and energy deposition densities.

The detailed level of the MARS simulations is illustrated by ﬁgure 7, using
the example of several 24 GeV proton interactions in an Inconel band. Figure 8
shows the corresponding yield and momentum spectra for all hadrons; ﬁgure 9
gives more detailed information for the pions. Several scatter plots to illustrate
the distribution in phase space of the produced pions are displayed in ﬁgure 10.
The plots are seen to be relatively symmetric in the x and y coordinates, which
indicates that any asymmetries due to the band tilt and elliptical beam spot are
largely washed out by the large phase space volume occupied by the produced
pions.

The yield per proton for positive and negative pions-plus-kaons-plus-muons
at 70 cm downstream from the central intersection of the beam with the target
was predicted for the kinetic energy range 32< Ekin <232 MeV that approx-
imates the capture acceptance of the entire cooling channel. Note that the
material in the ﬂanges of the I-beam for the Inconel and nickel targets was not

14

included in the calculation; its inclusion might result in a small change in the
predicted yield.

Table 3 summarizes the yield and energy deposition results from the MARS
calculations. It includes the several rows of derived results that assume the sce-
nario, taken from section 2, of 3.2 × 1013 captured pions. These derived quan-
tities are identiﬁed with a superscript “3.2” and include: the required number
of protons per pulse, ppp3.2, the required total proton pulse energy, E3.2
pulse, the
maximum localized energy deposition in the target material and corresponding
temperature rise, U 3.2

max and ∆T 3.2

max.

Approximately 7% of the proton beam energy is deposited in the target.
Detailed 3-dimensional maps of energy deposition densities were generated for
input to the dynamic target stress calculations that are discussed in the following
section.

10 Shock Heating Stresses

Probably the most critical issue faced in solid-target design scenarios for pion
production at neutrino factories or muon colliders is the survivability and long-
term structural integrity of solid targets in the face of repeated shock heating.
To investigate this, ﬁnite element computer simulations of the shock heating
stresses have been conducted using ANSYS, a commercial package that is widely
used for stress and thermal calculations.

The target band geometry was discretised into a 3-dimensional mesh contain-
ing approximately 30 000 elements. This was as ﬁne as the computing capacity
and memory allowed and was judged to be adequate for the accurate modeling
of shock wave propagation.

The ANSYS simulations conservatively assumed that the deposited energy
is all converted to an instantaneous local temperature rise. The dynamic stress
analyses were preceded by a transient thermal analysis to generate temperature
proﬁles using as input the 3-dimensional energy deposition proﬁles previously
generated by MARS for the production assumption of 3.2 × 1013 total captured
pions (see the preceding section).

Dynamic stress calculations were then performed both for a “free edge”
band, i.e., with no I-beam ﬂanges, and with a “ﬁxed edge” constraint, in which
the edges of the band are constrained against displacement in both the radial
and axial direction. The “free edge” boundary condition is appropriate for
the titanium alloy band; the “ﬁxed edge” model is considered likely to provide
an improved approximation to the Inconel and nickel bands with their I-beam
ﬂanges without requiring the extra computing capacity that would be needed
to simulate the more complicated true geometry.

The von Mises stress (i.e., the deviation from the hydrostatic state of stress)
was found to be initially zero but to develop and ﬂuctuate over time as the
directional stresses relax or are reﬂected from material boundaries. Figure 11
gives an example snapshot of the predicted von Mises stress distribution at one
microsecond after the arrival of a proton pulse, and the remaining ﬁgures 12

15

to 16 show various aspects of the predicted stress at the position of maximum
stress, respectively: the time development for 6 GeV protons and for all three
band material candidates; the same for 24 GeV protons; superimposed plots for
6 GeV and 24 GeV protons and for the nickel band; the stress development over
a long enough time-span to see the attenuation of the stress levels; and a check
on the time step used in the ANSYS calculations.

Table 3 summarizes the ANSYS predictions for the maximum stress created
at any time and any position in each of the band materials, V M 3.2
max. These
values were obtained by reading oﬀ from ﬁgures 12 and 13 and then scaling to
the bunch charge for a total yield of 3.2 × 1013 captured pions. The ﬁnal row of
table 3 displays the percentage of the fatigue strength (from table 2) that this
represents.

For the Inconel band, the calculated fraction of the fatigue strength that the
band would be exposed to in this “worst case” proton bunch scenario, 53-69%,
is either close to or slightly above what could be considered a safe operating
margin for the target band. A more deﬁnitive determination of the proton
beam parameters that allow survivability and adequate safety margins for this
target scenario could be provided by data from the ongoing BNL E951 targetry
experiment [21], with planned stress tests for bunched 24 GeV proton beams
incident on several types of targets, including Inconel 718. The Inconel target
may well be appropriate for some proton beam speciﬁcations at a muon collider,
and it has already been shown [3] to likely give a wide safety margin for the
more relaxed beam parameters of neutrino factories.

The titanium alloy was predicted to have a very conservative safety margin
even for the assumed muon collider beam parameters: only 10-14% of the fatigue
strength. Although the yield is about 20% lower than for the other two candidate
materials, target bands from titanium alloys look likely to survive with any
proton bunch charges that might reasonably be contemplated for muon colliders.
Finally, nickel targets are known to evade the predictions for fatigue strength
limits, as already mentioned. Test beam experiments would be required to
establish the suitability or otherwise of a nickel band production target for any
particular muon collider scenario.

All of the above calculations apply for a circumferentially continuous band.
It remains to check the level of von Mises stresses at the gaps between the
eight welded band sections, although it is noted that the BNL g-2 target was
deliberately segmented longitudinally in order to reduce the beam stresses. For
rotating band targets in muon colliders, additional periodic slots in the webbing
may also be considered for thermal stress relief and eddy current reduction in
rotating band targets for muon colliders.

11 Conclusions

In summary, the Inconel rotating band target design appears to be a promis-
ing option for pion production targets at muon colliders. The design concept
appears to be manageable from an engineering point of view, and initial simu-

16

lations of target yields and stresses are encouraging for each of three candidate
target materials: Inconel 718, titanium alloy 6Al-4V grade 5 and nickel.

Priorities for further evaluation of this target scenario include engineering
designs of the components, optimization of the band geometry for pion yield
and calibration of the target stress predictions to experimental targetry results.

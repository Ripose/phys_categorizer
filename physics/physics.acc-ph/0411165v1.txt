Abstract

An explicit and remarkably simple one-dimensional integral expression is derived
for the mean number hN i of photons emitted per revolution in synchrotron radiation.
3(1 − β2), printed repeatedly in the litera-
The familiar high-energy expression 5πα/
ture, is found to be inaccurate and only truly asymptotic with relative errors of 160%,
p
82% for β = 0.8, 0.9, respectively. A new improved high-energy expression for hN i is
given.

The fascinating story of synchrotron radiation emphasizing both the early theoretical
and experimental developments is well documented in the literature (e.g., [1]). The mon-
umental pioneering theoretical contribution of Schwinger [2, 3] and its direct experimental
impact has been particularly noted [1]. Although the main features of synchrotron radiation
have been well known for a long time, there is certainly room for further developments and
improvements. In this Letter, we use an earlier integral for the power of radiation obtained
by Schwinger [2, 3, 5] over ﬁfty years ago to derive an explicit expression for the mean
number hNi of photons emitted per revolution with no approximation made. The derived
result for hNi is a remarkably simple one-dimensional integral. We infer that the familiar
3(1 − β2) [6, 7] for hNi, and repeatedly printed in the lit-
high-energy expression 5πα/
erature, is rather inaccurate and is to be considered only as truly asymptotic in the sense
that even for speeds β = 0.9, 0.8 deviations from this expression are rather signiﬁcant with
large relative errors of 82%, 160% (!), respectively. In particular, our explicit result for hNi
is used to obtain a much-improved asymptotic high-energy expression for radiating particles.

Our starting expression for hNi is obtained directly from Schwingers formulae ([2],

Eqs. III 6, 7; [4], Eq. (C.11)) for the power.

Since the integrand factor in (1) multiplying exp(−izx) is an even function of x, only the real
part of the integral is non-vanishing. It is easily veriﬁed that hNi = 0 for β = 0, as it should

β = 0. To evaluate hNi = 0, we ﬁrst integrate over z, then over ρ to obtain

Upon a change of variable x/2 → x, we ﬁnally obtain the remarkably simple expression

There is no question of the existence of the latter integral for all 0 ≤ β < 1. [For completeness
we provide values for f (β): 0.1731, 0.7694, 2.1351, 5.7951, 11.4003, 54.7651 corresponding,
respectively, to β = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9, 0.99.]

The asymptotic constant a0 is overwhelmingly large in magnitude. It is the important con-
1 − β2 term. Eq. (9) provides
tribution that survives in the limit β → 1 beyond the 1/
a signiﬁcantly much improved high-energy expression for hNi. The relative errors in (9)
are quite satisfactory with 4.11%, 1.34%, 0.063% for β = 0.8, 0.9, 0.99. They are to be
compared with the relative errors of 160%, 82%, 17%, respectively, for the truly asymptotic
earlier formula.

COMPRESSION OF HIGH-CHARGE ELECTRON BUNCHES∗

Abstract

The AØ Photoinjector at Fermilab can produce high charge
(10-14 nC) electron bunches of low emittance (20π mm-
mrad for 12 nC). We have undertaken a study of the opti-
mal compression conditions. Off-crest acceleration in the
9-cell capture cavity induces an energy-time correlation,
which is rotated by the compressor chicane (4 dipoles).
The bunch length is measured using streak camera images
of optical transition radiation. We present measurements
under various conditions, including the effect of the laser
pulse length (2 ps sigma Gaussian vs. 10 ps FWHM ﬂat
top). The best compression to date is for a 13.2 nC bunch
with σz = 0.63 mm (1.89 ps), which corresponds to a peak
current of 2.8 kA.

INTRODUCTION

Electron beams with short bunch lengths are desirable for
high energy physics, free-electron lasers, and other appli-
cations.

In this paper we report on studies of compression at the
AØ Photoinjector of Fermilab [1, 2] with a chicane of four
dipoles as measured by a picosecond streak camera. The
photoinjector was prototyped for the TeSLA Test Facility
[3], and in that context, there are three stages of acceler-
ation and compression, and the chicane is the ﬁrst com-
pressor. The gun is a 1.625-cell π-mode normal conduct-
ing copper structure at 1.3 GHz whose backplane accepts
a molybdenum plug coated with a Cs2Te photocathode.
Solenoids for emittance compensation surround the gun. A
superconducting Nb nine-cell cavity accelerates the beam
to 16–18 MeV. After the dipole chicane are experimental
and diagnostic beamlines.

These streak camera measurements support electro-optic
sampling measurements reported in a companion paper in
these proceedings. Emittance measurements are reported
by J.-P. Carneiro et al. in these proceedings, and for 12 nC
the normalized emittance is ǫn = 20π mm-mrad without
compression. The issue of emittance growth during bunch
compression [4–8] is under study, though preliminary stud-
ies suggest an emittance increase of approximately a factor
of two.

2 EXPERIMENT

The streak camera is a Hamamatsu C5680-21S streak cam-
era with M5676 fast sweep module1 read out by a Pulnix
progessive scan digital CCD camera. Calibration was done
using a short UV laser pulse and a thick fused silica delay
block. We ﬁnd a calibration of 3.9 pixels/ps at the fastest
sweep speed with a limiting resolution of about 1 ps. After
one year, the calibration was repeated, and the high-voltage
sweep of the streak tube had degraded somewhat to 3.6 pix-
els/ps, so we report at most a 10% systematic uncertainty
in the bunch length measurements.

Optical transition radiation (OTR) light [9–11] was im-
aged by all-reﬂective optics to the slit of the streak cam-
era. OTR is prompt, and has a characteristic opening an-
gle of 1/γ, and in our case E = γmc2 ∼ 16 MeV, so
1/γ ∼ 32 mrad or 1.8◦. An out-of-plane (periscope) bend
rotates the image so that the vertical direction of the beam
falls on the horizontal slit. This is desirable to diagnose
aberrations since the chicane bends in the vertical plane.

The photocathode drive laser (built by the University of
Rochester) is a lamp-pumped Nd:glass system frequency-
quadrupled to the UV (λ = 263 nm) [12]. The UV laser
pulse is a Gaussian with σt = 1.9 ps. Then, the UV pulses
are temporally shaped to an approximate ﬂat-top distribu-
tion with 10.7 ps FWHM. We have measured the bunch
length with both the long and the short laser pulse.

A number of streak images was acquired at each setting.
After subtracting a constant background trace from the pro-
jected image, (unsubtracted noise which varied from image
to image was within ±0.5 pixel.) each streak image trace
is ﬁt to a Gaussian. The mean value from the ensemble
at each setting is reported, with error bars assigned from
the statistical spread of values from this ensemble. The ex-
ception to this is in Figure 1, where each streak image is
correlated with the charge measured on that shot, and the
error bar is the error in the Gaussian ﬁt.

3 RESULTS: LONG LASER PULSE

In Figure 1 we give the uncompressed bunch length ver-
sus charge. At low charge, the bunch length is the same as
that of the UV laser pulse on the cathode, but increases dra-
matically at higher charges. At high charge, (∼11–13 nC),
the beam was compressed and measured as a function of
the accelerating phases (Figure 2). We set the middle pair
of dipole chicane magnets to the nominal values (current
I = +2.0 A or 680 Gauss), and reduce the outer pair

slightly for vertical steering (typically −1.9 to −1.95 A).
The phases of the gun RF and 9-cell cavity RF are recorded
as the “set phase” from the control system (UNIX). In addi-
tion to the set phase, we give the 9-cell phase for maximum
energy (crest). The gun phase is referenced to PARMELA
by the curve of charge transmission vs. gun phase.

The point of best compression (Figure 2) is not sensitive
to the gun phase, however the bunch lengthens if the phase
is too early. Even for high charge, the measured bunch
length is easily compressed to less than 1 mm σz (or 3 ps),
and the optimum is 0.63 mm σz (1.89 ps).

4 RESULTS: SHORT LASER PULSE

The compression experiments were repeated with a short
Gaussian laser pulse (σt = 2 ps) on the cathode, with
the expectation that the space charge growth of the bunch
length would be more severe.

With the chicane dipole magnets off and degaussed, we
measured the uncompressed bunch length with a streak
camera looking at OTR radiation as before (Figure 4) from
1 nC to 5 nC. Even at low charge, the bunch length is more
than a factor of two longer than the initial laser pulse length
on the cathode, and increases linearly with charge. The
compressed bunch length for the short laser pulse is shown
in Figure 5, and the minimum is slightly larger, and at a
larger angle off-crest.

5 PEAK CURRENT

One ﬁgure of merit for (sub)picosecond electron bunches
is the peak current, which depends on both the charge and
the bunch length. If the beam is Gaussian in time,

I(t) =

Q

√2π σt

exp(−t2/(2σ2
t ))

(1)

Then the peak current is by deﬁnition the peak value of the
current proﬁle:

Ip =

Q

√2π σt

=

2√2 ln 2 Q

√2π τ

(2)

Repeating this experiment as a function of charge, we
ﬁnd that the minimum bunch length is shorter at lower
charge (Figure 3), because non-linear space charge growth
is uncompensated. The phase of optimal compression is

for the rms bunch length σz or the full width at half maxi-
mum (FWHM) τ.

We know of two other facilities which report peak cur-
rent at or above 2 kA which are 1.97 kA at the AWA [13]

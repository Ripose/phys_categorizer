Abstract

We describe a scheme for producing polarised positrons at the ILC from polarised X-rays created by Compton
scattering of a few-GeV electron beam oﬀ a CO2 or YAG laser. This scheme is very energy eﬀective using high
ﬁnesse laser cavities in conjunction with an electron storage ring.

1 Introduction

1

At the ILC there exists a well motivated physics case to have not only the electron beam, but also the positron
beam polarised [1]. Up to now two ideas to produce polarised positrons have been studied in detail. Both
schemes ﬁrst produce polarised photons which are then converted into polarised positrons in a thin target. In
the ﬁrst scheme the polarised positrons are produced in a helical undulator by the high energy electron beam
upstream of the interaction point [2]. In the second scheme the photons are produced by Compton scattering
of a 6 GeV electron beam oﬀ a CO2 laser [3].

The undulator scheme seems technically easier. However it requires the electron linac to be fully operational
before positrons can be produced and it adds an additional energy spread of 0.15% to the electron beam. Also
some important problems like the vacuum in the undulator and radiation on the beampipe inside the undulator
still need to be solved. For the Compton scattering solution a high current electron beam needs to be produced
and a complicated high power laser scheme is needed. However the positron polarisation can be switched easily
by switching the laser polarisation and the reachable degree of polarisation is in principle higher than for the
undulator scheme.

In this note some ideas are presented on how the time structure of the ILC could be utilised to produce polarised
positrons by Compton scattering of an electron beam in a storage ring and a laser resonator. R&D for technical
improvements toward an high ﬁnesse resonator (Gain> 10000, see appendix A) would obviuosly strongly
reduce the cost and the complexity of the proposed design.

This note is meant as a basis for ﬁrst discussions with accelerator experts to understand if this scheme is possible
at all.

1.1 Basics of Compton scattering

The kinematics and cross section of Compton scattering is governed by the variable

representing the scaled squared centre of mass energy of the electron-photon system. Eb denotes the electron
beam energy and ω0 the energy of the laser photons. α is the crossing angle of the electron beam and the laser.
The maximum energy of the scattered photons is given by Eγ < x/(x + 1)Eb. Relevant x values for polarised
positron production are x = O(0.01).

Since Compton scattering conserves parity, the total and diﬀerential cross section cannot depend on the indi-
vidual electron and laser polarisations, but only on their product Peλγ.

Figure 1 shows the total cross section as a function of x and the photon energy spectrum for x = 0.01 for
Peλγ = 0 and Peλγ = −1. The x dependence of the cross section in the relevant range is small and the
polarisation dependence almost negligible. The photon spectrum shows two peaks at zero and at maximum
energy.

The scattered photon polarisation depends on the laser and electron polarisation separately and is shown in
ﬁgure 2 as a function of the photon energy for Peλγ = −1 The dependence on the electron polarisation is very

small at small x so that there is no need for electron polarisation in the storage ring. For a highly polarised laser
very high γ polarisation can be achieved at high energy. Since also the polarisation transfer to the positron in
the pair production works best at high energy transfer the high energy positrons will be highly polarised.

1.2 The laser cavity scheme

In the damping ring the e+ are stored with a much smaller distance than in the main accelerator. In this note
it will be assumed that a distance of 3 ns is possible. This bunch spacing can also be used for the positron
production. It might thus be possible to store the electrons for the Compton scattering in a storage ring with
1 m bunch spacing and collide them in one or few points with a laser cavity. The length of this storage ring
is arbitrary too a large extent. The photons are converted into positrons in a thin target and the positrons are
captured in the same way as in the other schemes. The positrons are then accumulated in the damping ring or in
a special accumulator ring. If it is technically possible accumulation in the damping ring saves the cost of the
extra accumulator ring. However in this case the time between two trains needs to be shared between positron
accumulation and damping. A sketch of the proposed scheme is shown in ﬁgure 3. If the full time can be used
for positron generation each bunch can receive positrons from about 20000 beam-laser interactions.

For the laser cavity two concepts will presented, wither a solid state laser, like Nd:Yag with a wavelength
of λ = 1.06µm or a CO2 laser with a wavelength of λ = 10.6µm. For identical laser parameters the CO2
has ten times more photons/pulse than the Nd:Yag, however in practice the Nd:Yag laser can be focused to a
signiﬁcantly smaller spot size. Furthermore the Nd:Yag laser technology is better suited to develop high ﬁnesse
resonators to improve the photon intensity. Also the Compton ring energy needs to be higher in the CO2 version
to obtain the same scattered photon energy.

The bunch length is not directly employed in the calculations.

2.2 Brief review of laser–electron interactions

To estimate feasibility of Compton ring, here a brief classiﬁcation of photon–electron interaction is presented.

Electron–photon interactions mainly governed by two parameters: (i) the density of photons (ﬁeld strength
in classical electrodynamics), and (ii) the energy of each laser photon (frequency in classical electrodynam-
ics). We will refer to the ﬁrst parameter as the parameter of nonlinearity, to the second as the quantumness
(essentially quantum description of the process).

2 COMPTONRINGDESIGNANDSIMULATIONOFCOMPTONSCATTERING

For the Compton ring it is expedient to present the parameter of nonlinearity (see [4, 5]) as

ξ2 = 2ŻCr0λN =

σCλlasNlas ≈ 32.7 × NX .

3
4απ

Here α is the ﬁne-structure constant, r0 the classical electron radius, NX number of gammas scattered by each
electron in the bunch when travelling over a wavelength of laser radiation.

Thus, the radiation begins to transform into the synchrotron spectrum if the electron scatters more than 3 quanta
per 100 laser wavelengths.The linear Compton (Thomson) scattering takes place when ξ2 ≪ 1.

Quantum eﬀects – recoil of the electron when scattering oﬀ the laser photon which lead to change the cross
section and spectrum – are governed by the parameter

.

If a ≪ 1 then no quantum eﬀects such as decreasing of the cross section and of the energy of scattered gamma-
ray quantum are appeared.

2.3 Estimations

Generation of the required amount of gamma–ray quanta imposes certain demands upon number of laser pho-
tons scattered oﬀ the electron per a passage through all 30 IPs (IPs section): Each of 6.24 × 1010 should in
average scatter oﬀ 0.223 of gamma–ray quanta with the energy within 23.2 . . . 29 MeV interval. Since the total
length of all IPs is 30 × 0.9 × 2.5 = 67.7 mm ≈ 6770 wavelengths of CO2 laser λ ≈ 10 µm, then the condition
of linear Compton scattering fulﬁls. For the case considered – EX = 29 MeV, Ebeam = 4.1 GeV – the parameter
a ≈ 10−2 ≪ 1. Thus, the conditions for the linear Compton (see, e.g., Thomson [6]) are fully satisﬁed.

For the linear Compton spectrum, within the energy interval of 23.2 . . . 29 MeV there emitted are 0.248 of the
total number of photons.1 The required number of photons is bigger than estimated above, about 0.9 of gammas
per electron’s passage through IPs section. Nevertheless, the conditions for linear Compton scattering are still
satisﬁed with good margins.

The spectrum of collimated gamma rays in small-angle approximation (see [7]) is presented in Fig.4. The
collimator was adjusted to cut out gammas with energy below 23.2 for the ideal case of parallel electron
trajectories and zero energy spread.

2.4 Compton ring dynamics

Statistical properties of the bunches circulating in Compton storage rings are mainly governed by the syn-
chrotron radiation and scattering of laser photons oﬀ the electrons.

Being statistically independent, these two processes establish the stationary properties of the bunches – emit-
tances, squared energy spread s2, or squared bunch length σ2

y – as (see [8])

1These photons transmit about 0.45 of the gamma-beam energy. Hence, only the half of energy is useless and has to be dumped.

with w ≡ c / frf being the width of rf bucket (for 650 MHz w = 0.461 m), α1 the linear momentum compaction
factor. As it should be emphasised, the partial Compton energy spread for a given spectrum is determined only
by the energy of circulating electrons.

Energy loss of the electron for the rings under consideration is ∆EX = 0.9 × 29/2 = 11.2 MeV per passage (or
turn).

Synchrotron losses depend on the radius of curvature ρ in the bending magnets and the energy of electrons.

2 COMPTONRINGDESIGNANDSIMULATIONOFCOMPTONSCATTERING

Hence, for Ebeam = 4.1 GeV and B = 0.63377 Tesla every electron looses 1.160 MeV/turn which is suﬃciently
smaller as compared with the Compton losses (11.2 MeV/turn, see above). The beam dynamics in CO2 ring
will be laser-dominated, the rms steady–state energy spread (4) ∆Ebeam/ Ebeam = 3.43 ×10−2. Hence, to provide
stable lossless circulation of the beam, a low–compaction optics is almost mandatory [9].

For the listed in Table 1 parameters and the extremely low compaction optics (see [10]), α1 = 2 × 10−6, the
partial Compton stationary bunch length is 4.85 mm. Computation of steady–state yield for CO2 ring with
α1 = 2 × 10−6 and other parameters from Table 1 by an analytical code based on (3) for all three degrees of
freedom results in following: the yield per electron passage through IPs is 0.43, the bunch length 4.53 mm,
the horizontal emittance reduced down to 8.64 × 10−11 rad m. Thus, number of (23.2 . . . 29) MeV gammas is
6.2346 × 109.

Summarising the feature of steady–state regime of Compton ring operation, it has to be stated that this regime
is unacceptable due to the following reasons:

1. very high RF voltage is required to provide stable motion: if average energy losses per turn exceeds RF

amplitude, the RF bucket vanishes, see eq. (6) for q ≤ 1;

2. even if RF voltage is high enough, ﬂuctuations in number and energy of emitted gammas results in very

short beam life time (i.e. high quantum losses);

3. and even the short life time could be regarded as tolerable, bunch lengthening up to the steady–state will

reduce the gamma yield below demands.

2.5 Pulsed mode: basic idea

Consider a ring with very low synchrotron number Qs such that the inverse to it – the period of synchrotron
oscillations – much exceeds the temporal length of gamma burst TX: TX ≪ 1/Qs. Under such condition we
can consider the bunch as free, moving in the phase plane straight with constant velocity. (Transformation of
the energy spread into the bunch length takes at least a quarter of the synchrotron period.) Interactions of the
bunch with the laser pulse (recoils) result in Brownian dispersion and oﬀset along the momentum axis p (here
and below p is relative deviation of the energy of electron Ee from the synchronous p ≡ (Ee − Ebeam)/Ebeam):
The dispersion and oﬀset after n–th turn are σ2
and S dr = n h∆pi, respectively. The oﬀset is
p(n) = n
caused by drift due to the fact that any interaction of the electron with a laser pulse results decreasing p.

∆p2
D

E

Thus, if we set a bunch at the location in the phase space where the phase velocity directs vertically (along
p–axis) and is equal to the drift velocity opposite to it, then the bunch during the burst will not change location
of its centre-of-weight and length.

The scheme will be improved if the curvature of phase trajectories at the initial bunch location is low, which
can be attained for the nonlinear ring optics with suﬃcient cubic term in the phase slip factor.

2.6 Simulations

Simulations were performed with a code intended for modelling the longitudinal dynamics in Compton rings
with nonlinear compaction [11]. The code represents a turn constructed from 4 sections:

1. IPs – a particle can experience a series of random kicks, probability of which conforms with the particle

2.6 Simulations

phase coordinate φ and 3-D Gaussian distributed photon population in laser pulse; the random amplitude
of the kick obeys the linear Compton spectrum.

2. SL – losses due to synchrotron radiation: every particle experiences the regular kick with amplitude

proportional to the particle instant energy p.

3. DRIFT – the phase of the particle advances as φ f = φi + κ1 p + κ2 p2 + κ3 p3 (κ j are the normalised phase

slip factors).

4. RF – zero–length harmonic rf cavity: every particle receives a kick with amplitude depending of its

phase, p f = pi − Urf sin φ.

5. STAT – in–ﬂight statistics of the bunch.

The particle in the bunch is represented by the ﬂat zero–length disk with 2-Dim density distribution.

First simulations were performed to validate basic idea of the pulsed mode. The simulations have proved our
expectations true.

Then simulations of the both CO2 and YAG rings were performed. For each of the rings two optics were
chosen: a conventional linear (‘lin’) and a low–alpha nonlinear (‘nl’) with compaction factors like [10]. The
quadratic compaction factors, α2, were chosen to provide zero value to the quadratic phase slip factors κ2, see
[12]. For every optics, the initial position of the bunch in the phase plane were being set manually to attain
about a maximal average yield over the given number of turns.

Results are summarised in Table 2.

There were not lost particles for the both rings in 4500-turns operating cycle with the ﬁrst 50 or 100 turns with

It should be pointed out that the maximal theoretical yields for the given geometry – the crossing angle,
transversal dimensions of the bunch and all dimensions of the laser pulse are 2.78 × 1010 (CO2) and 3.04 × 1010
(YAG).

Number of scattered quanta per electron per passage through IP obtained from simulations is presented in Fig.5.

Nonlinear dependence of the yield on time occurs due to deviation of the bunch centre of weight, as presented
in Fig.6.

The considered systems in the pulsed mode are capable to meet demands imposed upon the Compton ring with
good margins for the stored laser power and the bunch density. It seems that ﬁne adjustment of the parameters,
especially the ring nonlinearity, initial bunch position in the phase plane, and laser-to-bunch matching, can
enhance the system performance.

3 BEAMSTACKINGINDAMPINGRING

3 Beam Stacking in Damping Ring

The ideal choice of accumulation ring turns out to be the damping ring itself. Due to its large circumference,
it can store the full number of positron bunches, while at the same time providing a signiﬁcant damping over
the 10 ms repetition period of the laser-beam collisions in the Compton ring. In addition, the longitudinal
bucket areas of the proposed damping rings is large (due to the small momentum compaction factor and high
rf voltage), which facilitates stacking. Choosing the damping ring for accumulation also avoids constructing
another ring. The damping ring will accumulate for 100 ms and then damp for another 100 ms (close to 10
damping times), for a main-linac repetition rate of 5 Hz.

The damping ring should store 2800 bunches with a bunch spacing of about 3.077 ns (325 MHz). The corre-
sponding ring circumference is about 3.3 km. The beam energy in the damping ring is chosen as 5 GeV. The
beam in the ring consists of 10 trains, each with 280 bunches. The longitudinal damping time is about 10 ms.

Each injected positron bunch coming from the laser-Compton ring has a bunch population of 2.4x108. Injection
occurs into all 2800 buckets on 10 consecutive turns. This 10-turn injection is followed by a 20-ms of damping,
after which the next 10-turn injection starts. The whole process of injection and damping repeats 10 times.
After 10 injections, the bunch charge is about 2.4 × 1010 positrons.

The transverse rms emittance of the injected positrons is of order 0.0015 rad-m for an undulator source and
0.006-0.007 rad-m for a conventional source [13]. We expect similar values for a source based on Compton
back scattering. The “edge emittance” and, therefore, the required acceptance is about 10 times larger than the
rms emittance [13]. The rms energy spread of the injected beam at 5 GeV is taken to be of order 0.14% and
the rms bunch length 3 mm. The injected energy spread is close to the equilibrium value, the bunch length is
about two time shorter.

The rf frequency of the damping ring is taken as 650 MHz. then the length of the rf bucket is about 45 cm,
about 15 times the injected bunch length of 3 mm. Therefore, it should be possible to inject 10 bunches into
the bucket without damping. For a more precise estimate, it is instructive to compute the bucket area.

The maximum energy deviation at the centre of the rf bucket is

We have simulated the eﬃciency of the stacking process. The simulation considers only the longitudinal phase
space. It includes a sinusoidal rf voltage, and the ﬁrst and second order momentum compaction factors. Radi-
ation damping and quantum excitation are modelled as in [14]. Damping-ring and beam parameters assumed
for this simulation are listed in Table 3. They are similar to those of the 3-km ILC damping ring designs PPA
and OTW [15].

The injection septum is placed at a location with large dispersion, since the stacking is performed in longitudinal
phase space. The septum blade is assumed to be small compared with the transverse dispersive beam size.
Between successive turns of injection, the orbit at the septum is varied with fast bumper magnets. It may prove
necessary to install injection septa on either side of the beam pipe, and to move the orbit from one side to

the other after 5 from 10 injections, so as to facilitate the injection of bunches with opposite sign of relative
momentum deviation and optimum phase-space coverage over 10 turns.

The energy of the injected beam is ramped such that the transverse position of the septum always corresponds
to a separation of 2σδ from the beam centroid, taking into account the local dispersion value. Consequently,
positrons of the stored beam being closer than 2σδ to the injected beam at the turn of injection are considered
lost. Likewise, injected positrons with a momentum oﬀset of more than 2σδ from the injected beam centroid
energy, in the direction towards the bucket centre, are also taken to be lost. The initial energy oﬀset is ﬁrst
changed from −1.05% to −2.45%, in steps of −0.35% from turn to turn, and then from +1.05% to +2.45% in
steps of +0.35%, over a total number of 10 turns. The point δ = 0 is left out, since this equals the position of
the accumulated damped beam.

With these assumptions, the simulated total loss during accumulation is about 18%. Figure 8 shows snap shots
of the accumulation process in the damping ring.

4 LASERSYSTEMDESIGN

4 Laser System Design

Figure 9: Schematic design of a CO2 laser system.

Figure 9 shows a schematic design of a high-power multi-bunch CO2 laser system. A long, ∼ 110µs low-energy
pulse is generated by a CO2 laser oscillator operating at 100 Hz. The energy of this long pulse is 14J. To realize
such a long pulse, the CO2 oscillator is pumped by an RF pulse.

This long pulse is sliced into ∼ 3.6 × 104 short, 3ps in rms, bunches (seed bunches) by Germanium (Ge )-plates
[16], which can switch between reﬂection and transmission. Each short bunch contains energy of 210nJ.

The reﬂectivity/transparency of the Ge -plates is controlled by a multi-bunch pico-second YAG laser. The YAG
laser consists of a mode-locked laser oscillator and an LD pumped ampliﬁer.

After slicing, ∼ 3.6 × 104 CO2 seed bunches are ampliﬁed by a preampliﬁer and a main ampliﬁer. Gains of the
preampliﬁer and the main ampliﬁer are 1000 and 10, respectively. Both ampliﬁers are RF-pumped in order to
realize long pulse (∼ 110µs). The preampliﬁer operates at 100 Hz. For the main ampliﬁer, interleaved 100 Hz
operation will be adopted, where the ampliﬁer operates at 100 Hz during 100 ms, and then takes a rest for the
next 100 ms. This interleaved mode of operation reduces the average beam power and, therefore, the heat load
on the main ampliﬁer.

Finally, we obtain ∼ 3.6 × 104 bunches, each of which contains 2.1 mJ and has a bunch duration of ∼ 3 ps in
rms. This short bunch width is necessary in order to match the laser-pulse-length to a depth-of-focus of ∼ 1

mm for the parabolic-mirrors, which create the ﬁnal small spot size. To achieve such a short bunch width, the
pressure of the CO2 gas in the pre and main ampliﬁers must be high (10 atm.).

In the case of a YAG laser system, we need a long, ∼ 92µs, low-energy pulse generated by a 325-MHz modelock
12-W YAG laser oscillator with 10-ps (FWHM) pulse width. To amplify the laser pulse energy from 37 nJ to 6
mJ, four pass ampliﬁcation is necessary with a long-pulse ﬂash lamp (∼ 100µs) and with an appropriate cooling
system for the ﬂash lamp and the YAG rod.

At this stage, we do not know whether a 100-kW YAG laser system is available or not, but the present laser
system of the ATF photo-cathode RF gun can generate about 0.1mJ/pulse over 400 pulses from a 357-MHz
6-W laser oscillator by a two-pass ampliﬁcation. We are planning to increase the pulse train length from 1µs
to 50µs and implement a 4-pass ampliﬁcation system. An ultimate technical limit on the maximum power is
set by thermal eﬀects on the various elements. If 100-kW YAG operation turns out to be impossible, we have
to increase the enhancement factor of the optical cavity from 100 to about 1000. In any case required are a
detailed engineering design of the laser system and an experiment on the generation of a huge laser power in
the burst operation mode.

If otherwise we want to refer to the existing thin-disk laser head technology (saturable absorber) [17] and
associate it with high ﬁnesse cavities ( gain 10000 - see appendix A) we will anyway require an enhancement
of a factor ∼ 50 in ﬂux but this scheme has the advantage to work in continuous mode and so with full duty
cycle. Therefore the remaining enhancement could be attained working on diﬀerent parameters:

1. Laser power. The thin-disk laser head technology is very promising and could attain even more power

for a single laser in the future.

2. Gain of the cavity. The R&D illustrated in appendix A is foreseen to attain a gain of 10000 in the ﬁrst

phase but a consecutive enhancement of an order of magnitude can be foreseen.

3. The increase of the charge/bunches.

4. Increasing the duty cycle of the positron injection in the damping ring.

5 COMPTONCOLLISIONCHAMBERDESIGN

5 Compton Collision Chamber Design

We assume the basic beam parameters for the ILC main damping ring listed in Table 3. Although there still
many parameter options for the main damping ring are being discussed, our scheme of polarised positron
generation can be adapted to each option by an appropriate change of the laser system, the Compton-ring
design and the 5-GeV injector linac. For simplicity, in this section we describe the design of the Compton
collision chamber only for the YAG laser case.

Our group [18] already demonstrated stable operation of the optical cavity with an enhancement factor of 230
using a 42-cm Fabry-Perot optical cavity made of a solid block of super-invar. Also, with this cavity we have
conducted a laser-Compton scattering experiment at the ATF damping ring and measured a large rate of γ rays
consistent with the calculation for a 90-degree crossing angle between the laser and the electron beam [19].
The conceptual setup of this experiment is shown in Figure 10.

In parallel, a Compton scattering experiment dedicated to polarised positron generation has also been done at
the ATF, in the extraction line. During the middle stage of this experiment in 2002, we used a short-focus
Compton collision chamber consisting of two oﬀ-axis parabolic reﬂective mirrors with a 5-mm diameter hole
for the passage of the electron beam [20]. For the next stage, we developed a hybrid optical cavity, in order to
both produce a small focal spot size and to increase the enhancement factor. The hybrid cavity consists of two
high reﬂective mirrors (99.9%) and two oﬀ-axis parabolic reﬂective mirrors (also 99.9% reﬂectivity), shown in
Figure 11. The mirrors are mounted on a cylindrical super-invar support equipped with numerous piezoelectric
actuators to control the position of the four mirrors and to maintain the resonant condition of the optical cavity.
Figure 11 indicates three cylindrical arms with hole on the left and right for the passage of the laser pulse. The
middle arm contains another hole for the electron beam.

Figure 12 shows a schematic diagram of the feedback circuit employed to keep the optical cavity on resonance
and to control the collision timing, which was used for a ﬁrst experiment in 2004. This experiment at the
ATF damping ring demonstrated a very precise collision control between a 10-ps laser pulse and the electron
bunch. The same techniques are also applicable for the Compton collision chamber design of the proposed
ILC positron-generation scheme, with the exception of the additional control needed for the distance between
two adjacent Compton collision chambers. This inter-chamber distance should equal a large integer multiple
of the laser wave length, in order to achieve a high enhancement factor and to maintain the collision timing of
the 30 cavities. The position of each Compton collision chamber can be controlled individually, with vacuum
bellows between neighbouring chambers. We are aware that an optical cavity with an enhancement factor of
10,000 is under development, but nevertheless we assume only a factor 100 enhancement in order to arrive at a
conservative design, given that the serial connection of 30 optical cavities introduces tighter tolerances, which
will be estimated after the detailed chamber design is completed.

The conceptual design shown in Figure 13 is our present proposal for the Compton collision chamber, which
occupies about 30 m length in the straight section of the Compton ring. We use a FODO lattice to keep the
electron beam focused at the Compton ring IP’s.

6 Injector Linac

23

The injector linac accelerates the positron beam generated by the Compton system. One pulse contains 280 ×
2 × 50 = 28000 or 280 × 100 = 28000 bunches. The bunch spacing is 3.08ns giving 28000 × 0.000308 = 86.2µs
pulse length. This pulse is repeated every 10ms, with 100Hz.

If we follow the terminology of TESLA TDR, the injector linac consists from the capture section, PPA(Pre
Positron Accelerator), and MPA (Main Positron Accelerator).

For the capture section and PPA, it is hard to use any cold structure due to the heavy radiation loss. On the
other hand, for MPA, both technologies, warm and cold, are possible because of the following reasons;

• Average current in a pulse is 10mA. The beam loading does not matter for the warm linac. It does not
matter for the cold linac too because it is identical to the main linac. Since I assume that the main linac
will be working well, there is no doubt to use the same cavity for the positron acceleration.

• Pulse length is 86.2µs. It might be critical for the warm linac, but the L-band warm cavity designed
for the original TESLA positron capture section, is operated in 0.95ms duration with 14.5 MV/m ﬁeld.
86.2µs pulse operation must be much easier than 0.95ms.

• Repetition is 100 Hz. For the warm linac, the heat load might be critical, but it can be cleared by assuming
the same technology in TESLA TDR again. There is no diﬃculty for the cold linac too because the inter
pulse period, 10ms, is even to ﬁll RF power into the cavity whose ﬁlling time is 500µs. All we have to
do is pay a small extra cost for the cooling.

In short, MPA based on the warm and cold cavities is possible with the conventional technologies assumed in
the ILC project. In the following sections, we will explain PPA based on the warm cavity and MPA with the
warm and cold cavities.

6.1 Positron Pre-Accelerator

The Positron Pre-Accelerator, PPA has a role to capture the generated positron. It also deﬁnes the acceptance
for the positron which should be consistent to the DR acceptance, dynamic aperture.

At this moment, the dynamic aperture is a current issue which will be discussed in the 2nd ILC WS in Snow-
mass, US, but let us assume εx,y ∼ 0.01m.rad as a reference. By taking this standard number among the
ILC researchers, most of issues related to PPA should be identical to those in other methods, undulator and
conventional[21].

In the original TESLA TDR, the PPA is a standing-wave normal-conducting L-band linac[22]. The front end
of the PPA consists of acceleration cavities embedded in a focusing solenoid. The ﬁrst two cavities have a high
accelerating gradient (Eacc = 14.5MV/m) and the others have moderate gradients (Eacc = 8.5MV/m). Each
cavity is powered by one 10MW klystron.

The only diﬀerence of the PPA in the Compton method is the repetition and the pulse duration. The averaged
current in a pulse is designed to be identical.

In other methods, the PPA is driven in 5Hz with almost 1ms duration. These numbers are 100Hz with 100ms
interval with almost 100µs duration in this method. The heat load to the cavity is estimated to be exactly same
as that in the other method since the ratio of the heat load to that of the other methods, Chl is accounted as

Chl =

(11)

where the ﬁrst fraction comes from the repetition rate, the second term means the ratio of the pulse duration,
and the last term means the duty cycle, i.e. the cavity is driven in half of every 100ms.

¿From this simple estimation, we do not have to pay any extra cost to drive the PPA with this high repetition
and short duration mode. We do not need any modiﬁcation on the PPA.

The gradients in the ﬁrst and second cavities of the PPA are limited by RF power and heat load restrictions.
Three dimensional thermal stress analysis indicates that stable and reliable cavity operation with a heat load
of about 30 kW/m is possible, corresponding to an accelerating gradient Eacc = 14.5MV/m with the long RF
pulse (950µs ﬂat-top) and repetition rate of 5Hz[23]. The heat load of the cavity in the same gradient with the
high repetition and short duration is identical, this statement is therefore also true for our case.

The rest of the PPA consists of ﬁve cavities with moderate gradient (8.5MV/m) as same as that in TESLA
TDR[22]. Each cavity has two accelerating sections. The transverse focusing is accomplished using quadrupole
triplets, placed between the sections. Each cavity is powered by one 10MW klystron.

At the exit of the PPA section, 287 MeV bunched positron beam is obtained.

6.2 MPA based on the warm technology

In MPA, the same technology as the latter part of the PPA section can be used to accelerate the beam up to 5
GeV.

One accelerating module consists from two accelerating sections and quadrupole triplets[23]. Total length of
the module is 4.3m. The energy gain per one module is 34.6 MeV. To accelerate the positron beam up to
5 GeV, 144 modules are required including 5% of the margin. The total length of the linac becomes 690m
including 0.5m for the quadrupole triplets inserted between the modules. One module is driven by one 10MW
klystron, so that totally 144 klystron is needed. The parameters of MPA based on the L-band warm structure,
are summarised in Table 4.

6.3 MPAbasedonthecoldtechnology

25

6.3 MPA based on the cold technology

If we employ the cold technology for MPA, we can use the system almost identical to that of the main linac.
The bunch spacing is 3.08 ns which is 100 times smaller than that in the main linac, but the bunch intensity is
only 0.03nC giving the exactly same average current, 10mA. Because of this fact, we can use the same cavity
and coupler including the coupling coeﬃcient.

If the cavity is operated in 100 Hz repetition with 100µs duration, the heat load generated when the beam is
on, can be identical to that in the main linac because of the same average current and eﬀective pulse duration,
100µs×10 = 1ms. The heat load coming from the RF ﬁlling and decay time, however, contribute and dominates
the total heat load.

If the heat load from the RF ﬁlling and decay period corresponds to that of 500µs of the beam period, the
multiplication factor of the total heat load of the Compton operation mode against to that of 1ms operation,
CRF is

500 × 10 + 100 × 10
1000 + 500
We need therefore 4 times larger cooling power to operate MPA in the Compton mode. This excess shares,
however, only 15/(500 + 500 + 5 + 5) = 1.4% and 15/(1000 + 1000 + 5 + 5) = 0.7% of the total heat load in
the whole ILC 500 and 1000 respectively.

CRF =

= 4.0

(12)

By considering the large emittance compared to the main linac, we have to employ a same arrangement of the
cryomodule of that in TESLA TDR. To achieve enough focusing to accelerate the positron beam which has a
large emittance, two types of the cryomodule assemblies are designed[22].

The cryomodule for MPA is implemented from the two types of the standard ILC cryomodules. The transverse
focusing is carried out by quadruples doublets. Type 1 module consists from four accelerator cavities and four
quadrupole doublets. Type 2 module consists from 8 accelerator cavities and 1 quadrupole doublets. The length
of the cryomodules are 11.4m and 12.4 m for type 1 and type 2 respectively.

In the TESLA TDR, the ﬁeld gradient in the cavity is assumed to be 25 MeV/m[22]. If we employ 35 MV/m
which is likely to be a new standard of the ﬁeld gradient in ILC, the energy gain per the module can be 140 and
280 MeV/module for type 1 and 2 respectively. Assuming this higher acceleration ﬁeld than that in TESLA
MPA module, we can reduce the number of the modules to be 6 of type 1 and 15 of type 2. Number of modules
in the original TESLA TDR was 8 of type 1 and 20 of type 2.

The total energy gain of MPA is estimated to be 5040 MeV. Including the energy gained by PPA, the ﬁnal
energy of the positron beam becomes 5290 MeV which is even enough by assuming 5% margin. Total length
of MPA becomes 270m. This number includes 0.5m for the inter-module bellows section and 5m for the cooling
channel. One 10MW klystron can drive 10 cavities with 35 MV/m gradient[25]. Total number of cavities in
MPA is 139 which requires 14 klystrons. Considering a margin, let us assume 3 klystrons for 6 type1 modules
and 12 klystrons for 15 type 2 modules. The total number of klystrons is 15. Parameters of MPA based on the
cold cavity are summarised in Table5.

7 Total System

27

Figures 14 and Figure 15 illustrate the total system for two versions of our proposal.

The ﬁrst represents the case of YAG laser Compton scattering. It assumes that one train (280 bunches) of
the electron beam is stably circulating in the Compton ring except for the period of the Compton scattering
(100Hz, about 100 µs pulse width, duty factor 50% ). Electron losses are not problem, but bunch lengthening
is a concern since the γ-ray yield depends on the bunch length due to crossing angle. From our beam tracking
simulation for the Compton ring, we infer that the beam loss is negligible and that the electron bunch recovers
in about 9.9 ms after a 100-turn burst collision. A more detailed design study and optimisation of the Compton
ring will necessary prior to construction. This γ-ray generation scheme requires a 100-Hz 5-GeV injector linac
after the conversion target and 10 times successive beam stacking into each bunch of the main damping ring,
which is repeated for 10 linac pulses. If we assume appropriate beam parameters, the beam tracking simulation
for the damping ring shows that 10 times successive beam stacking is possible. The conceptual design of the
Compton collision chamber and the laser system are described in Sections 5 and 6.

A preliminary Compton collision experiment has been performed using pulsed YAG laser (10ps FWHM) and a
simple Fabry-Perot optical cavity with a 90-degrees crossing angle. The state of art was already demonstrated
with about a factor 100 enhancement of the optical cavity, except for technologies and issues related to a small
crossing angle geometry and the more strongly focused laser beam size. The experimental test of a double
Compton-chamber system is necessary and under planning at the ATF damping ring.

An alternative system uses a CO2 laser. The principle of this scheme is analogous the case of the YAG laser.
One diﬀerence is that the beam energy in the CO2-laser Compton ring is 4.1 GeV instead of 1.3 GeV for the
YAG laser. The CO2 laser uses a 50-turns burst collision, instead of a 100-turn collision, The 50-turns collision
generates suﬃcient γ-rays in the Compton ring, which has a larger circumference and stores a beam of two
trains (2x280 bunches).

The average positron population of the injected bunches is about 2 × 108 for either laser, and this intensity
changes dynamically by a factor of about 4 during the Compton collisions. Since the beam loading is very
small, we do not expect any problem in the 5-GeV injector linac and can control the stacking beam intensity
in the main damping ring. The most important outstanding technical issues are to develop the laser system and
the Compton collision chamber.

The polarised-positron generation scheme which we propose is very ﬂexible, and of moderate size. It provides
a fully independent system which means that we can perform the ILC beam commissioning at full beam power
without the need of a 150-GeV electron beam. The design of the Compton ring, the Compton collision chamber,
and the laser system will be optimised with respect to tolerances.

A CAVITYR&DINORSAY

A Cavity R&D in Orsay

A.1

Introduction

The envisaged high ﬁnesse of around 30000 has already been reached for cavities ﬁlled with a continuous
Nd:YAG laser beam in polarimeters used at CEBAF [26, 27, 28] and DESY [29]. Also some cavities are
already working in the pulsed regime. At SLAC a cavity with 30 ps pulses reached a ﬁnesse of 12000 [30]. At
KEK a pulsed cavity is built for a laser wire application [18].

A.2 Description of present project

Figure 16: Schematic view of the feedback system. See text for a description of each component. In the MIRA
oscillator, mirrors M6, M7 and M9 (M10 being removed) and the two prisms P1 and P2 are used in the 100fs
regime. In the 1ps, the prism P1 is moved away from the optical path and M10 is inserted. The Lyot ﬁlter [39]
and the output coupler M1/OC are also changed.

Our R&D is an investigation on whether a high ﬁnesse Fabry-Perot resonator [31] can be used to ‘amplify’,
with an energy gain ranging from 104 to 105, a passive mode-locked laser beam [32]. This would allow a

drastic gain in the Compton cross section once that the cavity is located around the electron beam. Two pulse
laser time widths will be tried: full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 100fs and 1ps.

In a ﬁrst step, a confocal (mechanically stable) two mirrors cavity will be considered. High quality mirrors will
be mounted in order to reach cavity ﬁnesses of 30000 and 300000 (i.e. power gain of 10000 and 100000). In a
second step, a more complex resonator will be considered to reduce the laser beam waist inside the cavity : a
concentric cavity (mechanically unstable) made of two mirrors or a four-mirror cavity. This second step is still
under study at the present time. Both steps require a special mechanical design of highly stable cavity mirror
mounts and a great care on the reduction of the environment noise.

In principle, the smaller the pulse time FWHM the larger the laser frequency spectrum. One then expects that
chromatic dispersion induced by the pulse propagation in the multilayer mirror coatings [33, 34, 35] and the
ﬁnite frequency bandwidth of these coatings [36] will reduce the coherent coupling of the incident laser pulses
to the pulse circulating inside the cavity. We performed these calculations for soliton and Gaussian like pulses.
The cavity mirror reﬂection coeﬃcients were calculated numerically using standard multilayers formula [37]
including the values of the optical indices as given by our mirror coating manufacturer [38]. Fig. 17 shows the
eﬀective cavity gain β as a function of the gain of a 2m long Fabry-Perot cavity (i.e. the number of double layers
constituting the cavity mirror coating). From this ﬁgure one sees that this eﬀect is negligible for 1ps FWHM
whereas the coupling of the incident power is reduced by ≈ 14% for 150fs FWHM. Pulses with time FWHM as
small as 150fs can therefore be envisaged to be eﬃciently ‘ampliﬁed’ in a very high ﬁnesse Fabry-Perot cavity.
Note that passive mode locked laser pulses have a time shape closed to that of a soliton.

The experimental scheme of the ﬁrst step of our R&D is shown in Fig. 16. A commercial passively mode
locked laser, Coherent’s MIRA Ti:sa oscillator with 76MHz pulse repetition rate, pumped by a green laser
beam, Coherent’s 6W VERDI, is sent into a Fabry-Perot cavity. The laser is locked to the cavity by means of
the Pound-Dever-Hall technique [40] adapted to the pulsed laser beam regime [41, 42, 43, 44, 45]. Following
our estimation both the laser pulse repetition rate frep and the phase shift between the carrier and the envelope
of the electric ﬁeld ϕce [46] must be locked to the Fabry-Perot cavity in the two pulse length regimes (1ps and
100fs). To perform this locking, at least two error signals are necessary. To build the error signals, the laser
beam is phase modulated by an Electro-Optic-Modulator (EOM) and the signal reﬂected by the cavity is sent
to a diﬀraction echelle grating. The intensity is then read at diﬀerent positions, that is at diﬀerent values of the
wavelength. After demodulation, these signals are sampled and analysed by a digital feedback system (Lyretec
XXX card). Correction signals are built and sent to various actuators according to their frequency bandwidths
and functionalities:

• an Acousto-Optic-Modulator (AOM), used as an amplitude modulator for the pump laser beam to control

the fast variations of both frep and ϕce [48];

• a fast piezoelectric transducer glued on one of the oscillator mirror to control the fast variations of frep;

• a galvometer on which is located the mode locking starter (= two mirrors) to follow the slow drifts of

frep;

• a translation stage on which is located the oscillator output coupler to adjust roughly the oscillator length

to the Fabry-Perot cavity length;

• a piezoelectric transducer acting on the width between the platelets of the Gire-Tournois (GTI) interfer-
ometer [47]. With this actuator, one is able to follow the slow drifts of ϕce in the 1ps version of the MIRA
( frep being also aﬀected).

• a translation stage on which is located one of the prism in order to control the slow variations of ϕce in

the 100fs version of the MIRA ( frep being also aﬀected).

The feedback strategy is not, and cannot [48], be deﬁned a priori, i.e. one must calibrate the pump and oscillator
lasers to deﬁne which actuators must be used in conjunction with a given error signal. This calibration depends
on our lasers and on the environment noises. To calibrate the actuator responses, we shall follow the methods
of ref. [48, 49]. To characterise the phase and amplitude laser noises [50], we shall use the setups of refs.
[51, 52]. With our ’long’ pulses, an autocorrelator [53] will be used to observe the variations of ϕce during the
calibration experiments. As for frep, a spectrum analyser and a large band oscilloscope will be used. Finally,
the beam pointing stability of the pump laser beam will be determined as described in [49].

As previously mentioned, the mechanical stability will play a fundamental role in the second phase, where we
envisage to pass from a confocal conﬁguration to a concentric one. This will allow us to obtain a much smaller
waist size in the Fabry Perot resonator,thus increasing the photon density in the interaction point.

The main problem is that the concentric conﬁguration is highly mechanically unstable.

As an example we can say that in our 2m long cavity a waist of around 130 microns can be obtained with a 1
cm separation between the two centres of curvature of the two mirrors. This will imply a maximum range of
stability that corresponds to less than 10 microradian in tilt (for this tilt the optical axis is out of the cavity).
Reducing the waist size will require more stringent constraints.

Therefore much attention will be paid to the environmental noise suppression and for the optical table passive
stabilisation. The two mirrors of the cavity will be mounted on separate holders allowing an independent
distance regulation.

Furthermore, to approach this problem we have studied a new mirror holder system (see ﬁg 2) that will be tested
on the confocal cavity as a proof of principle. The principle of this holder is based on a monoblock cardan joint
system that allows both rotations around the geometrical centre of the mirror. Thanks to its speciﬁcity this
system is based on simple ﬂexions, thus avoiding backlask and friction. The external tilt adjustment is assured
by a wedge system.

This avoids the stacking of diﬀerent elements (therefore adding vibration sources), minimises the distance
between the regulation point and the support, and the mechanical coupling with the environment. A very good
sensitivity for the displacement is ensured by the high demultiplication factor that gives a precision of ≈ 0.5
microradian. A capacitive sensor is installed to measure the mechanical stability and the tilt and to eventually
provide the signal for an active feedback. This is installed on the support and reads the distance between the
support itself and the mirror holder. The resolution is 20 nm at 1 kHz of acquisition rate.

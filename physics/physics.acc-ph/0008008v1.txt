Abstract

Interaction between the bunches in the NLC main linac via
long range wakeﬁelds can cause a beam breakup instability.
Although the magnitude of the long range wakeﬁelds for
an ideal NLC structure is below the instability threshold,
the wake increases when structure manufacturing errors are
taken into account. In case of large errors, the developing
instability can result in the projected emittance dilution of
the bunch train. To suppress the instability, we propose to
introduce an energy spread between the bunches, similar to
the BNS energy spread for damping of the beam breakup
within a single bunch [1]. Based on simple estimates, we
show that the energy spread of order of 1-2% should be
enough for suppression of the instability. The results of
computer simulations with the simulation code LIAR con-
ﬁrm theoretical estimates and indicate that both the toler-
ances for structure misalignments and the incoming beam
jitter can be considerably loosened by introducing the en-
ergy spread within the beam.

INTRODUCTION

Interaction between the bunches in the NLC linac via the
long range wakeﬁelds can cause a beam breakup instability
[2], similar to the beam breakup within a single bunch that
is caused by short range wakes [3]. This instability, if se-
vere, imposes tight tolerances on the beam injection errors
as well as structure misalignments in the lattice.

An example of the the long-range wake for the NLC
structures is shown in Fig. 1. This wake was calculated
assuming a random frequency error of the dipole mode in
the structure with the rms spread of 3 MHz [4]. Note that
in contrast to the short-range wakeﬁeld, that can usually be
approximated by a linear function, the long-range wake is
a complicated oscillating function of the bunch position.

One can try to estimate the projected normalized emit-
tance growth ∆ǫ of a train of bunches caused by randomly
misaligned structures in the linac using the result of Ref.
[5] for the expectation value of ∆ǫ

where Nb is the number of bunches. Eq. (2) is derived as-
suming a lattice with the beta function smoothly increasing
along the linac as ¯β ∼ E 1/2. Note that Eq. (2) is only valid
if there is no beam break up instability, and hence gives a
minimal emittance growth for given misalignment.

For the wake shown in Fig. 1, h∆S 2i1/2 = 0.59
V/pC/m/mm. Using the nominal NLC parameters: N =
1.1 · 1010, ¯β = 7 m, Ns = 4969, Ls = 1.8 m, E0 = 10

GeV, Ef = 500 GeV, and assuming δy = 10 µm one ﬁnds
h∆ǫi = 2.9 · 10−10 m, which is about 1% of the nominal
beam emittance at the beginning of the linac, ǫ = 3 · 10−8
m.
However, computer simulations for this case with the
wake shown in Fig. 1 demonstrate the projected emittance
growth in the train of order of 50%, (see Fig. 2), that is
much larger than the above estimate. The reason for such
large emittance dilution is the development of the beam
breakup instability due to the long-range wakeﬁelds in the
bunch train reﬂected in quasi-exponential growth in Fig. 2.
To suppress the instability, one can try to introduce an en-

energy spread in the train. Since Eq. (4) was derived for
two macroparticles, one can expect that δ refers to the en-
ergy difference between the adjacent bunches in the train.
Hence, the required energy spread in the train for suppres-
sion of the instability is equal to δ multiplied by the total
number of bunches in the train, δtrain ≈ Nbδ. We can now
estimate δtrain as NbN e2wrmsFav, which gives

δtrain ≈ 0.03.

This should be compared with the energy spread of the or-
der of 1% within the bunch introduced for the BNS damp-
ing of the short-range beam breakup instability.

A more detailed theory of the beam breakup instability

in a train with the energy chirp can be found in Ref. [9].

SPREAD

To obtain a rough estimate of the energy spread required
to suppress the long range beam break up instability, we
use the autophasing condition for the BNS damping in the
two-particle model for a FODO lattice [7, 8]

between the two macroparticles with the interaction char-

To apply Eq.

We carried out computer simulations using LIAR code [10]
with variable energy spread in the train for the wake shown
in Fig. 1. In these simulations, the bunches were treated as
macroparticles to suppress the effect of short range wake-
ﬁelds. We used two types of energy proﬁles in the train. In
the ﬁrst case, the energy in the train varied linearly so that
∆Ek = −e(s)k, where k is the bunch number in the train,
and e(s) is the energy slope. The rms energy spread in the
train ∆E in this case is ∆E(s) = |e(s)|Nb/√12. An ex-

ample of the proﬁle of ∆E(s) along the linac is shown in
Fig. 4 — the energy spread was generated at the beginning
of the linac, and taken out at the end, so that the ﬁnal en-
ergy spread was close to zero. We also used an exponential
energy proﬁle in the train ∆Ek = e(s)[1 − exp(−3k/Nb)]
with the same functional form of the rms ∆E(s) as shown
in Fig. 4.

In the ﬁrst set of simulations, all structures were ran-
domly misaligned with rms value of 10 µm. The energy
spread in the train varied by scaling the proﬁle shown in

Fig. 4 and the ﬁnal effective emittance of the train was cal-
culated as a function of the maximum rms energy spread
(∆E/E)max (approximately at s ≈ 8000 m). The result
is shown in Fig. 5. Positive values of (∆E/E)max cor-
respond to the BNS-like energy proﬁle, when the energy
decreases toward the tail of the bunch and negative values
of (∆E/E)max correspond to the opposite slope of the en-
ergy proﬁle. As we see, the positive values of (∆E/E)max
are more effective in suppression of the emittance growth.
In the second set of simulations, the train was initially
offset by 1 µm (with all structures and quadrupoles per-
fectly aligned). The resulting emittance growth of the beam
as a function of (∆E/E)max is shown in Fig. 6. Again,
we see that the energy spread of the order of 1% results in
much smaller emittance growth then for the bunches with
the same energy.

4 DISCUSSION

An energy spread between the bunches in the NLC is nat-
urally generated in the linac by the beam loading effect. A

special compensation scheme in the present NLC design
will correct the energy spread to a minimal value. With a
slight modiﬁcation of the compensation scheme, it should
also able to introduce a small controllable energy spread re-
quired for the long-range BNS damping, as studied in this
paper. Another option of generating the energy spread be-
tween the bunches is using RFQ magnets.

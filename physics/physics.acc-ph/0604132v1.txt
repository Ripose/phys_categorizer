Diﬀusive Radiation is a new type of radiation predicted to occur in randomly inhomogeneous
media due to the multiple scattering of pseudophotons. This theoretical eﬀect is now observed
experimentally. The radiation is generated by the passage of electrons of energy 200KeV -2.2M eV
through a random stack of ﬁlms in the visible light region. The radiation intensity increases reso-
nantly provided the ˇCerenkov condition is satisﬁed for the average dielectric constant of the medium.
The observed angular dependence and electron resonance energy are in agreement with the theo-
retical predictions. These observations open a road to application of diﬀusive radiation in particle
detection, astrophysics, soft X-ray generation and etc..

Introduction. Several types of radiation mechanisms
are possible for a charged particle moving through a di-
electric medium. In the optical region well known mech-
anisms are the isotropic luminescence, ˇCerenkov radia-
tion(CR), bremsstrahlung and Transition radiation(TR).
Bremsstrahlung is related to the changing of particle ve-
locity due to the collisions with the atoms of the medium.
In the optical region it is negligible compared to other
mechanisms. CR is produced when the particle velocity
exceeds the phase velocity of the radiation in the medium
and is emitted under a certain angle cosθ = c/v√ε, where
v is the velocity of the particle and ε is the dielectric con-
stant of the medium, see for example, [1].

A charged particle uniformly moving in a randomly in-
homogeneous medium is known [2] to be radiating elec-
tromagnetic waves due to the ﬂuctuations of dielectric
constant. The origin of the radiation can be explained
as follows. Each charged particle creates an electromag-
netic ﬁeld around it which is not yet photon but a pseu-
dophoton. These pseudophotons scatter on the inhomo-
geneities of dielectric constant and convert into real pho-
tons. The main issue here is accurately to take into ac-
count the pseudophoton multiple scattering eﬀects. The
eﬀect was studied both for three dimensional (3D) [3]
and one dimensional randomness (1D) [4]. It was shown
that the radiation intensity consists of two terms. One is
caused by the single scattering of pseudophotons and the
other by their multiple scattering. When the conditions
for multiple scattering are fulﬁlled its contribution to the
radiation intensity strongly dominates. Single scatter-
ing contribution actually is the TR from the randomly
spaced interfaces.

Random multilayered systems are an example of a
medium with 1D randomness of dielectric constant. They
are of signiﬁcant interest due to the possibility of employ-
ing them in high energy particle detection [5]. Recently
multilayered systems have been considered as possible
sources for soft X-ray radiation [6, 7]. The CR and TR
mechanisms were explored for the above mentioned pur-

poses. Here we demonstrate the possibility of experimen-
tal generation of a new diﬀusive radiation (DR) mecha-
nism in these systems. DR strictly diﬀers from the other
radiation mechanisms by its angular distribution, depen-
dence of intensity on particle energy and etc.

For a given energy of electron the luminescence and
CR photon yields depend on the length of electron path
in the medium and does not related to the layered struc-
ture of the medium. Therefore to reveal the stack eﬀect
we compare the photon yields from the stack and a con-
tinuous medium with the same thickness of material, see
below.

Theory. Considering the radiation from a charged par-
ticle uniformly moving in a system of randomly spaced
parallel ﬁlms it was shown [4] that the multiple scatter-
ing of pseudophotons leads to the diﬀusion and its con-
tribution to the spectral angular intensity is given by the
formula

(λ/l)1/3 and conditions for pseudophoton multiple scat-
lin < Lz, where Lz is the system size
tering λ
in the z direction, are fulﬁlled. It is assumed that the z
axis is the normal to the ﬁlms and particle is moving on
that direction. The formula Eq.(1) has a clear physical
meaning [8]. The quantity e2γ2
mLz/c is the total number
of pseudophotons in the medium, 1/l is the probability of
the photon scattering and lin/l is the average number of
the pseudophoton scatterings in the medium. As it seen
from Eq.(1) the maximum of photon yield is achieved

at the resonant point γ−2
m = 0. Note that if one takes
into account the absorption of photons or ﬁnite sizes of
the system then the radiation intensity also will be ﬁnite
although still large. Close to the resonant point γ2
m is
substituted by the factor d2/λ2, where d
min[L, lin], λ
is the photon wavelength and L is the characteristic size
of the system. The resonance condition γ−2
m = 0 is the
ˇCerenkov condition for the average dielectric constant.
Hence one can say that the resonance diﬀusive radiation
(RDR) origins from the interaction of two processes. The
ˇCerenkov condition v√ε/c = 1 creates resonantly large
number of pseudophotons and multiple scattering con-
verts them into real photons. It should be emphasized
that in the 3D random case the resonant factor γ2
m en-
ters to the radiation intensity as lnγm [3], therefore 1D
randomness is more preferable for getting larger photon
yield.

It should be emphasized that the Eq.(1) is correct pro-
vided that v√ε/c
1. Note that the resonant velocity
c/√ε is much larger than the Cherenkov threshold veloc-
ity for the material c/√εf , because ε << εf . Preliminary
estimations show that for electron energies far above the
resonant energy DR is suppressed as compared to CR.

≤

Above we have taken into account absorption of pseu-
dophotons in the random medium. However already
formed real photons also will be absorbed in the medium.
Therefore to know what part of already created real pho-
tons will escape the system one should take into account
the absorption of real photons in the medium. Suppose
that we are interested in the photon yield from the depth
z in the material. Using Eq.(1) and adding an exponen-
tial decaying factor which takes into account the diﬀer-
ence of paths of real photons with diﬀerent emitted an-
gles, one has

Here dI
dz is the spectral-angular radiation intensity per
unit length of electron path in the medium. Note the sup-
pression of radiation intensity at very large angles. The
real DR photons are formed in the eﬀective size (llin)1/2.
Therefore when ﬁnding the total radiation intensity one
should cut the integral in the lower limit on this length.
After integration over the electron path, for the total
spectral angular intensity, we have

So as one could expect the absorption of real DR pho-
tons leads to the cutoﬀ of radiation intensity at large
angles and maximum lies at medium angles.

Experiment.In the present work, we report the exper-
imental observation of the DR generated by electrons
passing through a random mylar stack. A schematic rep-
resentation of the experimental setup is shown in (Fig. 1).
The setup allows to detect the photons in the wavelength

600nm and obtain their angular distribu-
range 300nm
÷
tion in the region θ = 50◦
75◦. The angular distribu-
÷
tion is provided by the movement of the photomultipliers
P 1, P 2 along the horizontal axis of the setup.

We use the following targets for generation of DR: A
low-density mylar stack consisting of 45 ﬁlms with thick-
ness 4.5µm and average spacing 55µm; a dense mylar
stack with 50 ﬁlms of thickness 3µm and average spacing
6.8µm and a polystyrene stack of 50 ﬁlms with thickness
3µm and average distance between ﬁlms 76µm. The di-
ameter of all targets is 50mm. For each stack it has been
made a continuous version with the same thickness of ma-
terial as in the stack. As a source of charged particles the
radioactive Sr90 giving electrons of energy 0.2
2.2M eV
is used. In order to interrupt the electron beam a lead
P b stopper placed between source and target is used.
Electrons pass through the target reach the scintillation
detector and are absorbed there. The radiation formed in
the target is reﬂected and focused to the photomultipliers
P 1, P 2. The photomultipliers has sensitivity in the wave-
length region 300nm
600nm. The mirrors have a form of
truncated cone with reﬂecting aluminium coating in the
inner surface. The optical scheme of the setup allows to
detect the radiation in both forward and backward direc-
tions.The direction of movement of electrons is assumed
as a forward one. The photon yields in both directions
have been detected in the conventional electron-photon
coincidence technique. During the experiment the pho-
tomultipliers P 1, P 2 where moved step by step to the
target from the most distant position, which corresponds
to minimal detection angle θ = 50◦. The photon yields
have been registered after each step of movement. The
number of steps, their widths and registration time were
given by programmed instruction. The number of steps
(3.4mm in widths) in the angle region of 50◦
75◦ was
80, that means at least 3 steps per degree. The data were
analyzed by LabView program package, collected by CA-
MAC and transferred to a PC by National Instruments
GPIB card.

Preliminary, the setup was calibrated under target
which give an isotropic radiation and acceptance curve of
optical scheme was obtained. As a source of an isotropic
optical radiation we used a scintillation polystyrene ﬁlm
with the same thickness as that of targets. Then all ob-
tained curves of radiation yield have been normalized on
the acceptance curve.

The intensity of the radiation yield in the optical range
of spectra can be represented as a sum of the follow-
luminescence, DR, ˇCerenkov Radia-
ing constituents:
tion(CR) and Transition Radiation. The luminescence
contributes the essential part of the radiation yield and
spread both in the forward and backward directions. The
DR according to Eqs.(1-3) is also the same for the back-
ward and forward directions. The CR has strictly for-
ward direction for a continuous target and for stack,
because of the multiple scattering of real CR photons,
spreads both in forward and backward directions. The
TR yield is negligible as compared to the other con-

stituents. The number of optical TR photons per one
electron is less than unity, 1/137 per one interface, see
for example [9], hence the TR photons can not contribute
to the electron-photon coincidence events.

The number of luminescence photons for a given energy
of electron ought to be the same for the stack and the
corresponding continuous target with the same thickness
of material. Therefore to reveal the DR photons from the
stack photon yield we extract the photon yield of a con-
tinuous medium with the same thickness of the material.
The obtained angular distribution of the low-density
mylar stack and the corresponding continuous target are
shown in (Fig. 2)-(Fig. 3). The photon yields from the
stacks are considerably higher than that of continuous
medium. The diﬀerence of these two yields we attribute
to the presence of DR radiation.

Although the number of DR photons is the same for
forward and backward directions, in the experiment, the
DR eﬀect in back is seen more clearly (Fig. 2). The
reason is the non proper extraction of CR photons from
the total photon yield. Apparently the number of CR
photons in the forward direction for the stack is smaller

tion.

 

than that for continuous target due to removing of some
photons from forward to back. Therefore the diﬀerence
curve in (Fig. 3) provides underestimated values for DR
photons. In other hand the diﬀerence curve for backward
direction (Fig. 2) provides overestimated values for DR
photons because of existence CR photons in backward for
the stack. The ratio of DR and CR intensities is of order
λγ2
m/l[8]. This ratio is large near the electron resonance
energy. Therefore the DR photons give the dominant
contribution to the diﬀerence curve.

Suppose that there is no DR mechanism. In this case
the photon yield in the forward direction from the con-
tinuous target should be larger than the yield from the
stack because lost of some forward photons due to re-
ﬂections on the interfaces. Remind that the number of
possible TR photons in the stack is negligible.

The observed angular dependence of emitted DR pho-
tons in backward direction (Fig. 2) is in good agreement
with the theoretical relation Eq.(3). The maximum of

mum moves to the region of larger angles. We observed
this phenomenon checking as a target the polystyrene
stack for which the maximum is located at 65◦. In the
polystyrene the photon absorption is weaker and corre-
spondingly lin is larger. Photon elastic mean free path l
in the geometrical optics region λ
a we are interested
in is of order of average distance between ﬁlms [4].

We attempted to measure the energy of those electrons
that radiate DR photons. The adjacent averaged en-
ergy distributions for diﬀerent mylar targets (low-density
stack, dense stack) and electron source are presented in
(Fig. 4). The source and low-density mylar stack distri-
bution functions are normalized to the same total number
of electrons. They have maximum at the same energy
interval 0.6M eV
1M eV . However the heights of the
maximums are diﬀerent. The highest maximum has the
low-density stack, second maximum has the dense stack
and both exceed the continuous mylar maximum. The
coincidence of the place of peaks from diﬀerent targets is
explained by the fact that the energy distribution func-
tion of the electron source has a broad peak in the region
1000KeV [10], (Fig. 4) . The DR eﬀect intensiﬁes
600
the height of stack maximums compared to the contin-

uous mylar maximum. For the low-density mylar stack
with the dielectric constant εf = 3.12 of ﬁlms, the aver-
age dielectric constant approximately equals 1.17 and the
corresponding resonance energy following from the con-
dition v2/c2 = 1/ε is of order 750KeV . This value lies in
the above mentioned interval of source maximum there-
fore a resonant increasing of the height of the maximum
takes place. The resonance energy for the dense stack is
of order 375KeV and is far from the electron source max-
imum. Therefore the increasing of height of the source
maximum due to the DR eﬀect is less. Note that if the
resonant factor γ2
m would not be in the DR intensity
Eq.(3) then the yield of photons from the dense stack
would be of the same order as from the low-density stack
because the ratio lin/l is the same for the two stacks.

Discussion. Above to reveal the DR photons we ex-
tract the photon yield of a continuous target from the
stack yield, assuming that the luminescence from stack
and continuous target is the same. However the number
of escaped luminescence photons from stack is smaller
than that from continuous target because the stronger
absorption in the stack. This is caused by the scattering
on the interfaces and therefore longer photon paths in
the medium. The negative values in the diﬀerence curve
(Fig. 2) is also explained by the stronger absorption in
the stack. We ﬁt the experimental data by the Eq.( 3)
taking into account the diﬀerent absorption in the stack
and continuous target, more details see in [11]. As fol-
lows from (Fig. 2) the agreement in the maximum region
is quite good. The discrepancy at large angles between
ﬁtted and diﬀerence curves perhaps is explained by the
non proper normalization on the acceptance curve for the
stack.

We have observed Resonant Diﬀusive Radiation in the
optical region for the ﬁrst time. The resonant charac-
ter of radiation is demonstrated. Angular dependence of
the observed radiation and the electron resonance energy
value are in agreement with the theory. The experimen-
tal conﬁrmation of DR in the X-ray region could lead to
interesting applications in high energy particle detection
[12], in the soft X-ray generation and [13] and etc.

INTRODUCTION

In accelerators with very short bunches, such as is envi-
sioned in the undulator region of the Linac Coherent Light
Source (LCLS)[1], the wakeﬁeld due to the roughness of
the beam-tube walls can have important implications on the
required smoothness and minimum radius allowed for the
beam tube. Of two theories of roughness impedance, one
yields an almost purely inductive impedance[2], the other a
single resonator impedance[3]; for smooth bunches, whose
length is large compared to the wall perturbation size, these
two models give comparable results[4].

Using very detailed, time-domain simulations it was
found in Ref. [3] that a beam tube with a random, rough
surface has an impedance that is similar to that of one with
small, periodic corrugations. It was further found that the
wake was similar to that of a thin dielectric layer (with
dielectric constant ǫ ≈ 2) on a metallic tube: Wz(s) ≈
2K0 cos k0s, with wave number and loss factor

and K0 =

with a the tube radius, δ depth of corrugation, and Z0 =
377 Ω. For the periodic corrugation problem this result
was inferred from simulations for which the period p ∼ δ.
On the other hand, at the extreme of a tube with shallow
oscillations, with p ≫ δ, the impedance was found, by a
perturbation calculation of Papiernik, to be composed of
many weak, closely spaced modes beginning just above pi
phase advance[5].

In this report we ﬁnd the impedance for two geometries
of periodic, shallow corrugations: one, with rectangular
corrugations using a ﬁeld matching approach, the other,
with smoothly varying oscillations using a more classical
perturbation approach. In addition, we explore how these
results change character as the period-to-depth of the wall
undulation increases, and then compare the results of the
two methods.

2 RECTANGULAR CORRUGATIONS

Let us consider a cylindrically-symmetric beam tube with
the geometry shown in Fig. 1. We limit consideration here
to the case δ/a small; for the moment, in addition, let δ/p
not be small. We follow the formalism of the ﬁeld matching
program TRANSVRS[6]: In the two regions, r ≤ a (the
tube region, Region I) and r ≥ a (the cavity region, Region
II) the Hertz vectors are expanded in a complete, orthogo-
nal set; Ez and Hφ are matched at r = a; using orthogonal-
ity properties an inﬁnite dimensional, homogeneous matrix
equation is generated; this matrix is truncated; and ﬁnally,

the eigenfrequencies are found by setting its determinant
to zero. We demonstrate below that, for our parameter
regime, the system matrix can be reduced to dimension 1,
and the results become quite simple.

Matching these ﬁelds at r = a, and using the orthogo-
nality of e−βnz on [−p/2, p/2], and cos[αs(z + g/2)] on
[−g/2, g/2] we obtain a homogeneous matrix equation. To
ﬁnd the frequencies, the determinant is set to zero; i.e.

For the beam, on average, to interact with a mode, one
space harmonic of the mode must be synchronous. We will
pick the n = 0 space harmonic to be the synchronous one;
i.e. let β0 = k (we take the particle velocity to be v = c).
Let us truncate the system matrix to dimension 1, keeping
only the n = 0 and s = 0 terms in the calculation. Now
if kδ is small, then the s = 0 term in R becomes R0 =
2/(kδ), the n = 0 term in I is I0 = ka/2, and N00 ≈ 1.
Eq. 8 then yields

k =r 2p

aδg

,

(11)

which, for p = 2g, equals k0 of Eq. 1.

The loss factor is given by K = |V |2/[4U p(1 − βg)][7],
with V the voltage lost by the beam to the mode, U the
energy stored in the mode, and βg the group velocity
over c. The voltage lost in one cell is given by the syn-
chronous (n = 0) space harmonic: V = A0p, and the

energy stored in one cell, U = 1/(2Z0c)R E · E∗ dv,

is approximately that which is in the n = 0 space har-
monic: U = πA2
0a2p(1 + k2a2/8)/(2Z0c) (for details,
see Ref. [6]). For βg, we take Eq. 8 truncated to dimen-
sion 1, and expand near the synchronous point. Taking the
derivative with respect to β0 and then setting β0 = k we
obtain:

(12)

4δg
(1 − βg) =
ap
The loss factor becomes K = K0.
The above method can be extended to modes of higher
multipole moment m, in which case the beam will excite
hybrid modes rather than the pure TM modes of above[6].
Again the system matrix can be reduced to the n = 0 and
s = 0 terms, and the lowest mode wave number and loss
factor have a simple form (for 1 ≤ m ≪ a/δ):

and K =

πa2(m+1) ,

(13)

and (1 − βg) = m(m + 2)δg/(ap). In particular, we note
that the dipole (m = 1) frequency is equal to the monopole
(m = 0) frequency. Also, the wake at the origin is the same
as for the resistive-wall wake of a cylindrical tube[8], as we
expect.

Fig. 2 shows a typical dispersion curve obtained by
TRANSVRS. Here k/k0 = 1.07, K/K0 = .94. Note
that even when δ/a is not so small, e.g. for bellows with
δ/a ≈ .2[9], the analytical formulas are still useful. Fig. 3
shows how the strength and frequency of the mode change
as the period of undulation is increased. The scale over

which K drops to zero is p0 ≈ πpaδg/2p. By p ∼ p0, the

one dominant mode has disappeared, and we are left with
the many weak, closely spaced modes of Papiernik.

3 SINUSOIDAL CORRUGATIONS

Let us assume now that the pipe surface is given by

r = a − h sin κz,

(14)

where 2π/κ is the period of corrugation, and h is its am-
plitude. We assume that both the amplitude and the wave-
length are small, h ≪ a and κa ≫ 1. This allows us
to neglect the curvature effects and to consider the surface
locally as a plane one. We will also assume a shallow cor-
rugation hκ ≪ 1, i.e. the amplitude of oscillation is much
smaller than the period.
Introducing a local Cartesian coordinate system x, y, z
with y = a − r (directed from the wall toward the beam
axis), and x directed along θ, the surface equation becomes
y = y0(z) ≡ h sin κz. The magnetic ﬁeld near the surface
Hx(y, z) does not depend on x (that is θ) due to the axisym-
metry of the problem. It satisﬁes the Helmholtz equation

Note that the longitudinal electric ﬁeld Ez can be ex-

(17)

Using the small parameter h/a, we will develop a perturba-
tion theory for calculation of Hx near the surface and ﬁnd
how Ez is related to Hx.

In the zeroth approximation, the z dependence of Hx is

dictated by the beam current periodicity,

Hx(y, z) = H(y)eikz.

(18)

Putting Eq. (18) into Eq. (15) we ﬁnd that d2H/dy2 = 0,
hence H(y) = H0 + Ay, where the constant A can be
related, through Eq. (17), to the electric ﬁeld on the surface,
A = ikEz. We will see below that A is second order in h.
For a ﬂat surface, for which ~n = (0, 1, 0), from the
boundary condition (16), we would conclude that A = 0,
however, the corrugations result in a nonzero A, and hence
Ez. Substituting the magnetic ﬁeld (18) into the right hand
side of Eq. (16) one ﬁnds

ihkκH0hei(k+κ)z − ei(k−κ)zi − ikζH0eikx.

~n∇H = −
(19)
Clearly, the boundary condition is not satisﬁed in this ap-
proximation. To correct this, we have to add satellite modes
to the fundamental solution (18)

Hx(y, z) = H(y)eikz + H1(y, z),

(20)

where

H1(y, z) = B+(y)ei(k+κ)z + B−(y)ei(k−κ)z.

(21)

The dependence of B± versus y can be found from the
Helmholtz equation,

B = B±0 e−y√κ2±2κk,

(22)

where B±0 are constants. In order for B± to exponentially
decay in y, we have to assume here that k < κ/2.

Substituting H1 terms into the boundary condition
(16) generates ﬁrst order terms that have x-dependence
exp i(k ± κ)x, and second order terms proportional to
exp(ikx). From the former one ﬁnds that

of the interaction of the synchronous wave with the beam.
In the limit of small frequencies, k ≪ κ the frequency is

.

We have to mention here that the perturbation theory
breaks down for very small values of h. Indeed, we im-
plicitly assumed that the satellite harmonics in Eq. (22) are
localized near the surface, otherwise our approximation of
plain surface becomes invalid. Hence, we have to require
that κ − 2k ≫ a−1, which gives the following condition
of applicability: h > a−1/4κ−5/4. This condition explains
why this mode was not found by Papiernik: being pertur-
bative in parameter h the approach developed in his paper
is applicable only when h can be made arbitrarily small.

Finally, in Fig. 4 we include also the results of Fig. 3, ob-
tained by ﬁeld matching for δ/a = .003 (the dashes). For
the comparison we make the correspondences p = 2π/κ
and δ = 2h. We note that even though the geometry for the
ﬁeld matching results violate our requirement for smooth-
ness, the results for the two methods are very similar.

One can now solve Maxwell’s equations with the bound-
ary condition given by Eq. (24) (see details in [10]). It turns
out, that in the region of frequencies k < κ/2 there exist
a solution corresponding to a wave propagating with the
phase frequency equal to the speed of light. The frequency
and the loss factor of the mode are shown in Fig. 4 (solid
lines). We see that decreasing the height of the corrugation
results in smaller wakes, and hence leads to the suppression

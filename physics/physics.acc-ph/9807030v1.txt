Abstract

A new class of self-consistent 6-D phase space station-
ary distributions is constructed both analytically and nu-
merically. The beam is then mismatched longitudinally
and/or transversely, and we explore the beam stability and
halo formation for the case of 3-D axisymmetric beam
bunches using particle-in-cell simulations. We concentrate
on beams with bunch length-to-width ratios varying from
1 to 5, which covers the typical range of the APT linac
parameters. We ﬁnd that the longitudinal halo forms ﬁrst
for comparable longitudinal and transverse mismatches.
An interesting coupling phenomenon — a longitudinal or
transverse halo is observed even for very small mismatches
if the mismatch in the other plane is large — is discovered.

INTRODUCTION

High-intensity applications of ion linacs, such as the trans-
formation of radioactive waste, the tritium production [1],
and drivers for spallation neutron sources [2], require peak
beam currents up to 100 mA with ﬁnal energies about 1
GeV and beam losses below 1 ppm. Understanding mech-
anisms of intense-beam losses, in particular, beam instabil-
ities and halo formation, is of primary importance to satisfy
these stringent requirements.

Most efforts in halo formation study have been concen-
trated so far on 2-D (and often axisymmetric, essentially 1-
D) beams, see [3] and references therein. While it produced
some analytical results for the simplest case, the K-V distri-
bution, for more realistic distributions particle-core model
and particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations have been used, [4]-
[10]. As was recognized from these studies, an rms mis-
match of the beam to the focusing channel is the main cause
of the halo formation.

To single out and explore the mechanism of halo forma-
tion associated with the beam rms mismatch, it is important
to start from an initial distribution that satisﬁes the Vlasov-
Maxwell equations and, therefore, remains stationary for
the matched case. A beam with some initial non station-
ary distribution will evolve from its initial state even being
rms-matched to the channel, due to redistribution effects
(its evolution is caused by mismatches in higher moments).
For 2-D axisymmetric beams, a set of stationary distribu-
tions with a sharp beam edge was constructed and explored
in [10]:

where H is the hamiltonian of the transverse motion, H0 =
const, and Nn are normalization constants. The set in-
cludes the K-V distribution as a formal limit of n → 0, as
well as more realistic ones, like waterbag (n = 1) and other
distributions, with higher non-linearities in space-charge
forces. In this paper, we present results of a similar pro-
gram in the 3-D case. More details can be found in [11].

2 STATIONARY 3-D DISTRIBUTION

2.1 Analytical Consideration

We consider a smoothed external focusing with gradients
kz, ky, kx. In general, the beam bunch can be chosen to
have an approximately ellipsoidal boundary. For simplic-
ity, we concentrate on the axisymmetric case (kx = ky),
for which the bunch is approximately spheroidal. Our ax-
isymmetric 6-D phase space distribution is

f (R, p) = N (H0 − H)

−1/2 , where
H = kxr2/2 + kzz2/2 + eΦsc(R) + mv2/2 .

(2)

(3)

Here p = mv, r2 = x2 + y2, and Φsc(R) is the electro-
static potential due to the space charge. We work in the
bunch Lorentz frame, where all motion is non-relativistic.
The distribution (2) is analogous to (1) with n = 1/2.
Since all its dependence on the coordinates is through the
hamiltonian H = H(R, p), which is an integral of motion,
the distribution is stationary. The same would be true for
other exponents in (2); however, for the particular case of
-1/2, the Poisson equation in 3-D case is linear. Namely, it
can be written as

2
∇

G(R) = −ks + κ

G(R),

where ks = 2kx + kz, κ2 = (eQ/ǫ0)/
the bunch charge, and

R

dRG(R), Q is

G(R) ≡ H0 − kxr2/2 − kzz2/2 − eΦsc(R) .

(5)

The solution to Eq. (4) for a spheroidal shaped bunch
can be written in the spherical coordinates R, θ (cos θ =
z/R, sin θ = r/R) as G(R) = (ks/κ2)g(R), where

g(R) = 1 +

αℓP2ℓ(cos θ)i2ℓ(κR) .

fn(H) =

(cid:26)

for H ≤ H0 ,
for H > H0 ,

(1)

Here P2ℓ(cos θ) are the even Legendre polynomials and
i2ℓ(κR) are the spherical Bessel functions (regular at κR =

0) of imaginary argument. Since g(R) is proportional
to the charge density, the bunch edge is determined by
the border g(x) = 0, closest to the origin. We choose
αℓ’s to approximate a spheroidal surface with semiaxis a
in the transverse direction and c in the longitudinal one,
r2/a2 + z2/c2 = 1.

From the equations of motions, we express the rms tune

depressions as

η2
x,rms ≡

mh ˙x2i
kxhx2i

, η2

z,rms ≡

mh ˙z2i
kzhz2i

.

(7)

Note also that mh ˙x2i = mh ˙y2i = mh ˙z2i = mhv2i/3,
because H depends only on v2 and R. Thus our choice
of the form f (H) automatically corresponds to equiparti-
tion (equal average kinetic energy in the three spatial direc-
tions). The values of αℓ in Eq. (6) for given c/a and κa are
dsg2(R) along the boundary. For
found by minimizing
a ﬁxed bunch shape c/a, the rms tune depressions depend
on the dimensionless parameter κa (see in [11]). A con-
tour plot of g(R) for a typical case c/a = 3, κa = 3.0 is
shown in Fig. 1. This range of parameters corresponds to
the Accelerator Production of Tritium (APT) project [1].

2.2 Numerical Investigation

A 3-D particle-in-cell (PIC) code has been developed to
test the analytic model of normal modes [11] in the distri-
bution Eq. (2) and to explore halo formation. The single-
particle equations of motion are integrated using a sym-
plectic, split-operator technique. The space charge cal-
culation uses area weighting (“Cloud-in-Cell”) and imple-
ments open boundary conditions with the Hockney convo-
lution algorithm. The code runs on parallel computers (we
mostly used T3E machine at NERSC), and in particular,
the space charge calculation has been optimized for paral-
lel platforms. Up to 2.5 · 107 particles have been used in
our simulation runs, with 106 being a typical number.

Initially, the 6-D phase space is populated according to
Eq. (2), and then the x, y, z coordinates are mismatched by
factors µx = µy = 1 + δa/a, µz = 1 + δc/c and the cor-
responding momenta by 1/µx = 1/µy, 1/µz. Simulations
show that an initially matched distribution remains stable
even for very strong space charge. Introducing some initial
mismatch leads to the oscillations of the core, and later on

the beam halo develops, as shown in Fig. 2. This ﬁgure
shows maximal values zmax and xmax of the longitudinal
and transverse coordinates (in units of a) of the bunch par-
ticles versus time, for the case µx = µz = µ. The jumps
of zmax and xmax correspond to the halo formation mo-
ments; after that the distribution stabilizes. One can see
that the longitudinal halo develops earlier than the trans-
verse one for equal mismatches in both directions. This is
in accordance with our expectations since the longitudinal
tune depression is lower for an elongated bunch.

arbitrary units, c/a = 3, ηx = 0.65, ηz = 0.49.

Choosing larger mismatch either longitudinally or trans-
versely, one can observe primarily the longitudinal or trans-
verse halo, respectively. Results of a systematic study for
different bunch shapes c/a and mismatch parameters are
summarized below, ﬁrst for the longitudinal case.

We deﬁne the halo extent as a ratio of the halo maximal
size to that of a matched distribution. The longitudinal
halo extent is found to be approximately linearly propor-
tional to the mismatch. In addition, the ratio zmax/(µc)
slightly increases for stronger space charge, from 1.2–1.3
for ηz above 0.5 to 1.4–1.5 for ηz < 0.4. The halo in-
tensity, deﬁned roughly as the fraction of particles outside
the bunch core, was also found depending primarily on the
mismatch. Large mismatches (40% and higher) lead to sev-
eral percent of the particles in the halo, which is clearly
outside acceptable limits for high-current machines. Obvi-
ously, serious efforts should be made to match the beam to
the channel as accurately as possible.

For a ﬁxed mismatch, the halo starts to develop earlier
for more severe tune depression. Another interesting obser-
vation is that for purely longitudinal mismatches (µx = 1)
in elongated bunches (c/a > 2) the longitudinal halo inten-
sity shows a strong dependence on the mismatch. The num-
ber of particles in the halo drops dramatically with µz > 1
decreasing; in fact, we see no halo for µz < 1.2. A similar

threshold behavior was observed in 2-D case [10].

The extent of the transverse halo has a similar linear
dependence on the mismatch: xmax/(µa) depends weakly
on ηx, just slightly increasing from 1.4–1.5 for ηx around
0.8 to 1.6–1.8 for ηx < 0.4. Again, the halo intensity is
governed primarily by the mismatch. In general, the trans-
verse halo closely duplicates all the features observed for
non-linear stationary distributions in 2-D simulations [10].
The only two differences seen are related to the moment
and rate of halo development: ﬁrst, in 3-D simulations it
clearly starts earlier for severe tune depression, which was
not the case in 2-D; and second, the transverse halo in the
3-D case develops signiﬁcantly faster than in 2-D for com-
parable mismatches and tune depressions.

Our 3-D simulations clearly show the coupling between
the longitudinal and transverse motion: a transverse or lon-
gitudinal halo is observed even for a very small mismatch
(less than 10%) as long as there is a signiﬁcant mismatch
in the other plane. For example, in Fig. 3 we see a lon-
gitudinal halo for only 5% longitudinal mismatch, when
µx = µy = 1.5. The coupling effect is noticeable even for
modest mismatches. We mentioned above that µz ≥ 1.2
is required to observe a longitudinal halo when µx = 1.
However, when there is a mismatch in all directions, the
halo develops even for µz = µx = µy = 1.1 (10% mis-
match in all directions). Such a behavior clearly shows the
importance of the coupling effect.

3 SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

Unlike previous studies of 2-D models of long beams, this
paper addresses the beam stability and halo formation in
a bunched beam with the parameters in the range of new
high-current linac projects [1, 2]. A new class of 6-D phase
space stationary distributions for a beam bunch in the shape
of a prolate spheroid has been constructed, analytically and
numerically. Our choice of parameters automatically as-
sures equipartition. We therefore study the halo develop-
ment in 3-D bunches which are in thermal equilibrium,
without masking effects of the initial-state redistribution.
Such an approach allows us to investigate the major mecha-
nism of halo formation associated with the beam mismatch.

Using our PIC code with smoothed linear external focus-
ing forces, by introducing an initial mismatch in the trans-
verse and/or longitudinal directions we ﬁnd that both trans-
verse and longitudinal halos can develop, depending on the
values of tune depressions and mismatches. An interest-
ing new result is that, due to the coupling between the r
and z planes, a transverse or longitudinal halo is observed
for a mismatch less than 10% if the mismatch in the other
plane is large. Our main conclusion is that the longitudinal
halo is of great importance because it develops earlier than
the transverse one for elongated bunches with comparable
mismatches in both planes. In addition, its control could be
challenging. This conclusion agrees with the results [12]
from the particle-core model in spherical bunches.

We expect only small quantitative differences for distri-
butions (2) with other exponents, not -1/2, based on results
for the set (1) in 2-D [10]. More interesting are 3-D ef-
fects due to the phase-space redistribution of an initial non-
stationary state. Our preliminary results from PIC simula-
tions show that the redistribution process can produce the
beam halo in the same fashion as a small rms mismatch
[13]. A similar conclusion was made for 2-D axysymmet-
ric beams [5, 9]. In 3-D, however, the effect can be ampli-
ﬁed by the coupling, especially noticeable in the bunches
with c/a close to 1.

Abstract

The interest in using optical transition radiation (OTR) in high energy
(multiGeV) beam diagnostics has motivated theoretical and experimental
investigations on the limitations brought by diﬀraction on the attainable
resolution. This paper presents calculations of the diﬀraction eﬀects in an
optical set-up using OTR. The OTR diﬀraction pattern in a telescopic sys-
tem is calculated taking into account the radial polarization of OTR. The
obtained diﬀraction pattern is compared to the patterns obtained by other
authors and the eﬀects of diﬀerent parameters on the shape and on the size
of the OTR diﬀraction pattern are studied. The major role played by the
radial polarization on the shape of the diﬀraction pattern is outlined. An
alternative method to calculate the OTR diﬀraction pattern is also sketched.

1 Introduction

Optical transition radiation (OTR) provides an attractive method for diag-
nostics of charged particle beams and it has been used for instance for electron
beam diagnostics in the keV-MeV energy region. There have been, however,
statements that the geometrical resolution of OTR might deteriorate drasti-
cally at high energies due to the diﬀraction phenomenon [1]. During the last
years there have been several studies concerning the resolution of OTR (see
Refs.[2] - [11]) and this paper extends these investigations concentrating in
the optical diﬀraction of OTR in a telescopic system.

In order to study the resolution of the optical transition radiation, we
shall calculate the diﬀraction pattern of OTR on the image plane of a tele-
scope, which is situated in the direction of specular reﬂection of the incident
particle (i.e. only the case of backward OTR is considered). Naturally, the
results are valid on the image plane of any kind of imaging system. Scalar
diﬀraction theory (see, for example, Ref.[12] or Ref.[13]) used by D.W.Rule
and R.B.Fiorito in Refs.[3]-[5] does not take into account the polarization
of the ﬁeld. Precisely, in the case of OTR the polarization is important,
since the polarization of OTR is not uniform, but radial (the electric ﬁeld
is in a plane containing the wave vector and the direction of the specular
reﬂection). This can be taken into account by considering separately the
horizontal and the vertical ﬁeld components. The method is similar to that
used by A.Hofmann and F.M´eot in Ref.[14] for synchrotron radiation. Our
treatment yields a satisfactory description of the diﬀraction phenomenon and
provides a relatively simple, clear and straightforward method to compute
the transition radiation diﬀraction pattern.

After recalling some basic characteristics of the optical transition radi-
ation and of the scalar diﬀraction theory we shall consider the diﬀraction
eﬀects of diaphragms in a telescope and use the obtained expression in the
particular case of OTR. The diﬀraction pattern of OTR will thus allow us to
study the inﬂuence of diﬀerent parameters on its shape and size. Our result
will also be compared with others using the same hypothesis (polarized char-
acter of OTR) [9], [11]. A comparison of the OTR diﬀraction pattern with
the well known standard diﬀraction pattern and with the ”scalar” diﬀraction
pattern similar to that obtained by D.W.Rule and R.B.Fiorito [3]-[5] will be
presented. As OTR is radially polarized, a comparison with isotropic radia-
tion, radially polarized, will allow us to precise the respective contribution of
the non-constant angular distribution of OTR. A more theoretical treatment

1

will also be given for the OTR diﬀraction.

2 Recalls

Before calculating the diﬀraction pattern of OTR in a telescopic system, we
shall recall some basic characteristics of OTR and of the scalar diﬀraction
theory.

2.1 Optical transition radiation

Transition radiation is emitted when a charged particle crosses a boundary
between two media of diﬀerent optical properties. The emission occurs both
into the forward and backward hemispheres with respect to the separating
surface. Here, we shall consider the case of a single boundary between a metal
and vacuum. Due to metal opacity, only forward (resp. backward) OTR is
observed when the electron moves from metal to vacuum (resp. vacuum to
metal). If the surface is perfectly reﬂecting (r = rk = r⊥ =
1), the angular
distribution is approximately given (in Gaussian units) by (see, for example,
Ref.[15]):

where θ is the angle with respect to the electron velocity (forward OTR) or
to the direction of the specular reﬂection of that velocity (backward OTR).
γ is the Lorentz factor of the electron, and Eq.(1) is valid for γ
1 and
θ

1. From now on we will consider the case of backward OTR (Fig.1).
The emitted electric ﬁeld has two polarization components: one in the
plane of observation (ˆzsˆn -plane in Fig.1) and the other one in the plane per-
pendicular to that. In the transverse plane perpendicular to the direction of
specular reﬂection (ˆxˆy -plane in Fig.1), the electric ﬁeld is radially polarized
and in that plane it can be decomposed into horizontal (ˆx-direction) and
vertical (ˆy-direction) components.

2.2 Transformation of image ﬁelds by an optical sys-

tem in the scalar wave diﬀraction theory

Let us ﬁrst consider a wave of frequency ω = (c/n)k propagating between
two planes Π and Π′ without any lenses between them. In the scalar wave
theory, with the approximation of Gaussian optics, the amplitude ψ(P ′) in
the plane Π′ is related to the amplitude ψ0(P ) in the plane Π by

ψ(P ′) =

i
λ ZΠ

−

ψ0(P )

where R is the distance between points P and P ′. The time-dependent factor
e−iωt has been factored out both in ψ and ψ0. We can treat the (1/R)-factor
as a constant (in the Gaussian optics approximation) and write

ψ(P ′) = A

ψ0(P )eikRdS

ZΠ

where A = i/(λL) and L is the distance between the two planes.

Let us now consider the case where one or several ”non-diaphragmed”
lenses are inserted between the planes Π and Π′. By ”non-diaphragmed”
lens, we mean a lens with an aperture much larger than the transverse size
of the optical wave packet. Eq.(3) can be generalized as 1

ψ(P ′) = A

ψ0(P )eikL(P,P ′)dS

(P, P ′) is the optical distance between points P and P ′, i.e. the

along the geometrical optical ray connecting P and P ′; n is the refractive
index. A is a complex factor, which depends only on the location of the
planes and which we will not calculate, since we are interested only in the
shape of the OTR image.

3 Diﬀraction eﬀect of diaphragms in a tele-

scope

In this chapter we consider diﬀraction eﬀect caused by the diaphragms of
a telescope, and in the next one we will take into account also the special
properties of optical transition radiation.

We have taken the experimental set-up used in our experiment at Orsay
[6] as the geometrical basis for the diﬀraction calculations. In this experiment
backward optical transition radiation emitted by a 2 GeV electron beam was
measured in the direction of the specular reﬂection. The set-up consisted
of an OTR radiator, two lenses in a telescopic conﬁguration and a CCD-
camera; henceforth the CCD is referred to as a screen. The ﬁrst lens had a

focal length of 1 m and a diameter of 8 cm; the focal length of the second one
was 25 cm and the diameter 14 cm. The ﬁrst lens with a smaller diameter
gives the eﬀective aperture limitation of the system. The telescope geometry
is presented in Fig.2.

We will treat the eﬀect of the real diaphragm (at the ﬁrst lens) in a slightly
approximate but convenient way, replacing this diaphragm by a virtual one,
with the same diameter, but located in the common focal plane between the
lenses 2.
In that plane, the spatial coordinates are directly related to the
angles of the emitted radiation (a = f1θ).

Our observation point P ′ is situated in the image plane of the telescope
(see Fig.2) and, according to Eq.(4), the modulus of the ﬁeld at this point is
related to the amplitude ψ0 in the common focal plane by

aperture area ǫ of the virtual diaphragm.

The coordinates of a point B in the virtual diaphragm are x = a sin φ
and y = a cos φ (Fig.2).
In the image plane we use ”prime” coordinates:
x′ = ρ sin φ′ and y′ = ρ cos φ′. The angular directions v and u in the small

ence. All the rays leaving the diaphragm in a particular direction are focused
by the second lens into the same point of the screen (see Fig.3).

According to the theorem of Malus [16], all the rays perpendicular to
a given surface (BF in Fig.3) have an equal optical path length from the
surface to the focus point (point P ′ in Fig.3), and thus the optical path

where k = 2π/λ and ψ0(a, φ) is the amplitude of the wave in the intermediate
focal plane. The integration is made in polar coordinates and a0 is the
radius of the smaller lens (the limiting aperture of the system). It should
be noticed that Eq.(10) is a particular form of a two-dimensional Fourier
transform of the wave amplitude ψ0. We can therefore say, in agreement
with Ref.[17, Chap.5,
5.2.2], that the ﬁeld in the image focal plane of the
§
lens L2 is proportional to the Fourier transform of the ﬁeld in the object
focal plane of L2. In our derivation, this property appears essentially as a
consequence of the Malus theorem.

4 Diﬀraction of OTR in the telescope

In the calculation of the diﬀraction pattern of optical transition radiation
(i.e. the OTR spot in the image plane of the telescope) we need to consider
both the amplitude and the polarization of the incident wave.

The scalar diﬀraction theory can be used without modiﬁcation for the
vector case if the direction of the ﬁeld is the same in each point on the
diaphragm. The electric ﬁeld of transition radiation is, however, radially
polarized i.e. for every azimuthal angle φ the ﬁeld vector has a diﬀerent

7

direction (it is always pointing to the centre of symmetry). We may take
this characteristic into account by considering separately the horizontal and
vertical ﬁeld components. The total intensity is the sum of the intensities
from these two components.

When we decompose transition radiation into plane waves with direc-
tions of θ, the amplitude is proportional to ~θ/(γ−2 + θ2), where ~θ is a two-
dimensional vector. When considering the two polarization components sep-
arately, ~θ can be replaced by (θ sin φ) for the horizontal and by (θ cos φ) for
the vertical component 3 (Fig.1). The phase of these plane waves is precisely
zero in the impact point S.

A plane wave, whose direction of propagation has an angle θ with respect
to the direction of specular reﬂection and whose azimuthal angle is φ, is
focused to the point B = (a, φ) on the virtual diaphragm (where θ = a/f1)
and the modulus of the electric ﬁeld amplitude in this point is given by

Eω(B)

= C ′

|

|

(a/f1)
γ−2 + (a/f1)2

(11)

where f1 is the focal length of the ﬁrst lens and C ′ is a constant that takes
into account the normalization and units.

When considering horizontal and vertical components separately,

Eω(B)
|
has to be multiplied by the factor (sin φ) or (cos φ), respectively, and we can
write

|

ψ0h(a, φ) =
ψ0v(a, φ) =

Eω(B)
Eω(B)

sin φ
cos φ

|
|

|
|
where ψ0h(a, φ) refers to the horizontal component and ψ0v(a, φ) to the ver-
tical one. We should multiply Eq.(12) and Eq.(13) by a phase factor cor-
responding to the propagation between S and B. However, because E and
B are on the same wave surface, the optical paths SE and SB are equal
(invoking the Malus theorem), and if we forget the constant phase factor, we
do not have any extra phase factors to add into Eq.(12) and Eq.(13).4

(12)
(13)

3Here the polar angle φ is deﬁned with respect to the vertical axis.
4The plane wave decomposition of OTR is proportional to the two-dimensional Fourier
transform of the OTR ﬁeld at the radiator. Therefore, Eq.(11), like Eq.(10), can be
considered as an application of Ref.[17, Chap.5,
§

5.2.2], the lens being in this case L1.

where J1 is the ﬁrst order Bessel function and C a generic normalization

We have deﬁned the angle φ with respect to the vertical axis. Of course
this angle can as well be deﬁned with respect to the horizontal axis. In that
case the sin φ and cos φ -factors in Eq.(12) and Eq.(13) are changed with
each other and the horizontal component instead of the vertical one gives
the contribution to the intensity of Eq.(17).

The integration over a in Eq.(17) can be performed numerically and the
result as a function of the radius ρ on the screen is shown in Fig.4 for our
experimental conditions (E = 2 GeV, f1 = 1 m, f2 = 25 cm, a0 = 4 cm,
θ1 = a0/f1 = 40 mrad, λ = 500 nm). This distribution, which represents the
diﬀraction pattern of an OTR source taking into account the radial polariza-
tion, is shown around the symmetry axis. Since we are not interested in the
absolute intensity, the peak intensity is normalized to unity. The magniﬁca-
tion of the used telescope is M = f2/f1 = 0.25; if we use an imaging system
with magniﬁcation of one, the diﬀraction pattern is naturally four times
wider. The FWHM size of the pattern in Fig.4 is about 4.5 µm (FWHM
18 µm, when M = 1). This pattern shape is in full agreement with that

≈

of V.A.Lebedev obtained in Ref.[9]. Similar observations concerning this
pattern shape are presented in Ref.[10] and Ref.[11].

Figure 4: OTR diﬀraction pattern (intensity) around the symmetry axis on
the image plane of a telescope with magniﬁcation M = 0.25 (E = 2 GeV,
f1 = 1 m, f2 = 25 cm, M = f2/f1 = 0.25, a0 = 4 cm, θ1 = a0/f1 = 40 mrad,
λ = 500 nm).
In a one-to-one imaging system the size of the diﬀraction
pattern is four times larger.

4.1 Eﬀects of diﬀerent parameters on the OTR diﬀrac-

tion pattern

Next we study the eﬀects of diﬀerent parameters on the OTR diﬀraction
pattern. Since we are only interested in the size of the pattern, the peak
intensities are always scaled to unity. In all the ﬁgures the magniﬁcation of
the system is 0.25; when using a one-to-one imaging system, the patterns are
four times wider.

10

Fig.5 shows the OTR diﬀraction pattern for diﬀerent wavelengths. We
can see, as expected, that the size of the pattern scales proportionally to the
wavelength. The resolution can be improved when using smaller wavelengths,
but if we are out of the optical range (λ <
350 nm), we can not use an optical
∼
imaging system and the experimental conditions become more complicated.

b) λ = 500 nm and c) λ = 1 µm) on the image plane of a telescope with
magniﬁcation M = 0.25. The used parameters are the same as in Fig.4.

In Fig.6 the geometrical size of the aperture (a0) is varied. Naturally, the
decrease of the aperture size causes an enlargement of the diﬀraction pattern.

Fig.7 shows OTR diﬀraction pattern for diﬀerent energies in the GeV
energy range. The FWHM size of the distribution is independent of γ. The
diﬀerence is in the tails: the higher is the energy, the stronger are the tails.
In Refs.[2],[6],[18] and more recently also in Refs.[10] and [11], it has been
considered a possibility to use a mask 5 to improve the spatial resolution.
The eﬀect of a mask can be taken into account by introducing into Eq.(17)
an extra pupil function representing the cut caused by the mask. It amounts
to set the lower limit of integration in Eq.(17) to am instead of zero, where

am is the radius of the mask 6. A mask reduces the tails, as can be seen in
Fig.8, where OTR diﬀraction pattern for E = 10 GeV (M=0.25) has been
plotted with and without a mask (amask = 2 mm). However, it does not
aﬀect signiﬁcantly the FWHM size of the pattern.

4.2 Diﬀraction of a gaussian emitter

So far, we have considered OTR emitted by a single electron. Diﬀraction of
OTR emitted by a gaussian beam can be treated by convoluting on the image
plane the OTR diﬀraction pattern and a gaussian distribution, which is the

Let us calculate for comparison the diﬀraction pattern of an ideal isotropic
point source (the standard diﬀraction pattern) in a telescope. In that case

In Fig.9 the standard diﬀraction pattern given by Eq.(21) (curve a) is
compared with the OTR diﬀraction pattern given by Eq.(17) (curve c) in
our experimental conditions. The peak intensities are both normalized to
unity. We can see that the OTR diﬀraction pattern is wider (the FWHM
size is about 2.7 times that of the standard diﬀraction pattern) and has a
zero in the center.

6 Diﬀraction of ”scalar OTR”

If we do not take into account the radial polarization of OTR, but only the
angular distribution of it, we can use the right hand side of Eq.(11) as the
algebraic amplitude. By substituting it into Eq.(10) we obtain

sulting diﬀraction pattern is plotted in Fig.9 (curve b). The peak intensity
is again normalized to unity. This pattern is similar to the pattern obtained
by D.W.Rule and R.B.Fiorito in Refs.[3]-[5]. The FWHM size of this ”scalar
OTR” diﬀraction pattern is by a factor
1.2 wider than the FWHM size
of the standard diﬀraction pattern; the FWHM size of the ”vector OTR”
pattern given by Eq.(17) is by a factor of
2.2 wider than the FWHM size
of the ”scalar” one (Eq.(23)).

7 Importance of the radial polarization in the

diﬀraction phenomenon

For a ﬁeld which is invariant by rotation about the direction of the specular
reﬂection, the amplitude distribution and the polarization of the ﬁeld can be
described by separate functions

where C is a generic normalization constant.

Eq.(27) is plotted in Fig.10 (curve a) together with the OTR diﬀraction
pattern (curve b). The peak intensities are both normalized to unity.
It
is important to understand that the peculiar shape of the OTR diﬀraction
pattern in the central region with a zero in the center is essentially determined
by the radial polarization. The non-constant angular distribution of OTR
only widens the pattern a little: the FWHM value is wider by a factor of
1.2, when the OTR angular distribution is taken into account.

(Eq.(27)) and b) OTR angular distribution (Eq.(17)). The used parameters
are the same as in Fig.4.

8 Another treatment of OTR diﬀraction

Diﬀraction of OTR can also be studied from a more theoretical point of view.
A detailed treatment of this kind is presented elsewhere [10] and here we only
shortly show that we can obtain, using this method, the same expression for
diﬀraction pattern as obtained in paragraph 4.

The angular distribution of transition radiation in natural units (c = ¯h =

ǫ0 = 1, e2/4π = α = 1/137) can be written as

In the case of forward radiation Eq.(28) is the spectrum emitted by a

region) can be decomposed in plane waves

9 Summary and conclusions

In this paper, we have considered the limitations brought by the diﬀraction
to the resolution of OTR images of high energy charged particles. Starting
from the scalar wave theory, some basic formulas concerning the wave prop-
agation in an optical system were recalled. Choosing, for the optical system,
a telescope which exhibits very simple and interesting properties, we have

20

calculated the diﬀraction pattern of the OTR wave emitted by one electron.
A virtual diaphragm, located in the common focal plane between the lenses
of the telescope, allowed us to express the diﬀraction in a rather simple way.
The radial polarization of OTR was taken into account by considering the
horizontal and vertical ﬁeld components separately.

Our result coincides with that of V.A.Lebedev [9] and it is in qualitative
agreement with that of D.W.Rule and R.B.Fiorito obtained in the scalar wave
approximation [3]-[5]. The obtained diﬀraction pattern was also compared
to the well known standard diﬀraction pattern. The FWHM size of the OTR
diﬀraction pattern is by factor of
2.2 wider than the ”scalar OTR” pattern
and by factor of

2.7 than the standard diﬀraction pattern.
Consideration of the general shape of the OTR diﬀraction pattern shows
that the FWHM width is insensitive for the particle energy, whereas the tails
increase with the energy. These tails may be seen by very sensitive detectors:
in that case, a central optical mask constitutes an eﬀective cure.

∼

In conclusion, up to energies considered (γ

104), the eﬀects of the
diﬀraction, evaluated by the FWHM of the OTR diﬀraction pattern, are not
limiting the resolution. The resolution depends more likely on the properties
of the experimental set-up, the contrast sensitivity of the detector and the
data treatment procedure.

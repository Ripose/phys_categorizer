A semiclassical Foldy–Wouthuysen transformation of the Dirac equa-
tion is used to obtain the radiationless Bloch equation for the polari-
sation density.

1

Introduction and Motivation

A complete picture of spin polarisation in accelerators and storage rings, either with
or without synchrotron radiation, can only be obtained on the basis of evolution
equations for combined spin–orbit distributions. See Article I. Moreover, if we are
concerned with the eﬀects of radiation, its simulation by classical white noise and
damping does not suﬃce for all situations. For example we cannot obtain the Sokolov–
Ternov eﬀect by that means.
In fact to include all the subtleties of radiation, a
quantum mechanical approach is needed and then obtaining the ‘complete picture’
implies that we must begin by ﬁnding the equation of motion for the spin–orbit
density operator in the presence of radiation. To ensure some level of transparency
and trackability one begins by ignoring direct and indirect inter–particle eﬀects so
that at the classical level the beam would be described by a single-particle density
depending on the six orbital phase space variables, the spin variables and on time as
in statistical mechanics in ‘µ-space’.

In the single-particle approximation, only positive energy two-component spin-
orbit wave functions are needed. The appropriate quantum Hamiltonian is provided
by a Foldy − Wouthuysen (FW) transform [1] of the Dirac Hamiltonian and in
order to get explicit results for time-dependent electromagnetic ﬁelds one has to use
perturbation theory. Since we are interested in high energy behaviour in storage rings
we do semiclassical perturbation theory, where the expansion parameter is Planck’s
constant, not 1/m etc. Before launching into the full blown calculation of the eﬀects of
radiation one should ﬁrst obtain the transformed Hamiltonian for motion due to the
Lorentz forces in the ﬁelds of the storage ring and then the corresponding equations of
motion for the spin and orbital parts of the density operator. The evolution equations
for the resulting classical distributions should then be derived. These are the tasks
of this paper. Radiation will be considered elsewhere.

The required Hamiltonian was already stated at ﬁrst order in ~ by Derbenev and
Kondratenko [2] as the starting point for their radiation calculations, but no construc-
tion was given. In this paper we show how to obtain the transformed Hamiltonian to
second order in ~. Owing to space limitations we will be very brief but full details
can be found elsewhere [3]; see also [4, 5, 6, 7].

2 The Dirac equation
The underlying Dirac-equation is i~(∂ψ/∂t) = Hopψ where:

Hop := c(~αop · ~πop) + mc2γop,4 + eφop

We use the matrix representation of [8].

3 The perturbation theory

A unitary operator Uop which performs the FW transformation (a ‘unitary FW opera-
tor’) transforms a wave function ψ in the Dirac representation into the corresponding
wave function Uopψ in the FW representation. In the FW representation the Dirac
equation reads as i~ ∂ψ

∂t = ˜Hopψ where

˜Hop := UopHopU −1

op + i~ ∂Uop
∂t

U −1
op

and the electron wave functions, i.e. the ‘positive energy wave functions’ have only
upper components which we denote by χ1, χ2. Then in the Dirac representation the
positive energy wave functions read as ψ = U −1
op (χ1, χ2, 0, 0). Thus in this represen-
tation the ‘positive energy projection operator’ Λ(+)

op reads as

Λ(+)

op := U −1
op

(1 + γop,4)Uop .

2

By Eq. (2) the FW transformation (and the FW Hamiltonian) is not unique because
Uop can be replaced by any unitary operator Vop, such that UopV −1
is even (‘essential
op
uniqueness’ of the FW transformation). Our task is now to develop a perturbation
theory to construct a Uop. Then at k-th order (k ≥ 0) in ~, Uop is approximated by
an operator Uop,k. Starting with zeroth order, to satisfy Eq. (2), we must choose Uop,0
such that

where ˜Hop,k denotes the k-th order approximation of the FW Hamiltonian. Having
ﬁxed Uop,0 the remaining task is to choose the Uop,k for k ≥ 1 such that ˜Hop,k is even
in k-th order. That this procedure leads to a unique energy projection operator can
be shown [3] by using a method due to Pursey [9]. For
k ≥ 1 we compute the Uop,k recursively in the form
Uop,k := ˜Uop,k ˜Uop,k−1 · · · ˜Uop,1Uop,0, where:

˜Uop,j := exp

with Jop :=
˜Hop,j, so that Oop,j anticommutes with γop,4 and ˜Hop,j − Oop,j commutes with γop,4.
Thus Oop,j is the odd part obtained after the (j + 1)-th step.

Expanding hdk
op w.r.t. 1/m one gets in ﬁrst order in 1/m (‘nonrelativistic limit’):
mc2 + (1/2m)(~πop · ~πop) + eφop − (e~g/4mc)(~σop · ~Bop) which for g = 2 is the Pauli-
Schroedinger Hamiltonian.

6 The density operator in the two-component formalism

The density operator ρop reads as:

ρop =

(ρop,orb + ~σop · ~ξop) ,

1
2

(8)

where ρop,orb and ~ξop do not contain spin degrees of freedom. The normalisation of the
density operator reads as 1 = T r[ρop] = T r[ρop,orb]. Expanding the Hamiltonian and
the density operator to second order, the evolution equation for the density operator,
the ‘von-Neumann equation’, reads in ﬁrst order as:

1

Note that the second order parts of the Hamiltonian drop out of this von-Neumann
equation because they are independent of spin. By Eq. (8) the von-Neumann equation
is in ﬁrst order equivalent to:

(10)

The terms proportional to ~Ωop in Eq. (9) account for the eﬀect of the SG force on the
orbital motion and the second and third terms on the rhs of Eq. (10) have the same
structure as the Thomas-BMT equation.

The terms hdk

op,orb and ~Ωop in the von-Neumann equation are not unique because
the FW Hamiltonian depends on the chosen FW transformation. However, essential
uniqueness allows the forms in Eqs. (6) and (7).

7 The Weyl transform in the two-component formalism

The ‘Weyl transform’ allows q-numbers to be represented by c-numbers. In the two-
component formalism an operator Kop is represented by its Weyl transform Kwt via:

Kwt,νλ(~r, ~p; t) := T r[KopMop,νλ∆op(~r, ~p)] ,

(ν, λ = 1, 2) ,

(11)

where the operator ∆op is deﬁned by:

∆op(~r, ~p) :=

1
8π3~3 Z

d3x d3u exp
(cid:16)

i
~ [~x · (~r − ~rop) + ~u · (~p − ~pop)]
(cid:17)

,

4

and where the operators Mop,11, ... are deﬁned by:

(Mop,νλ χ)µ = δµνχλ ,

(µ, ν, λ = 1, 2) .

Conversely one has:

Kop =

1
8π3~3

2

Xν,λ=1

Mop,νλ Z

d3r d3p Kwt,νλ∆op .

(12)

Thus the Weyl transform is a 2 × 2 matrix valued phase space function; the t-
dependence in Kwt only occurs for time-dependent operators. In terms of its Weyl
transform the trace of an operator Kop reads as:

(13)

(14)

(15)

T r[Kop] =

1
8π3~3 tr[
Z

d3r d3p Kwt] ,

where tr denotes the matrix trace.

8 The Wigner function

The chosen normalisation of the density operator ρop leads to:

1 =

1
8π3~3 tr[
Z

d3r d3p ρwt] ,

for its Weyl transform ρwt (see Eq. (13)) and one calls (1/8π3~3)ρwt the ‘Wigner
In terms of Weyl transforms the expectation value of an
function’ of that state.
operator Kop reads as:

< Kop >=

1
8π3~3 tr[
Z

d3r d3p ρwtKwt] .

9 The Wigner-Kirkwood expansion

Since we are dealing with a beam, which in a high energy accelerator occupies a phase
space volume many orders of magnitude greater then ~3, we are very far from dealing
with a pure state. Then, applying semi-classical perturbation theory to the density
operator, its Weyl transform has the ‘Wigner-Kirkwood’ form:

ρwt =

ρ0

+ ~ · ρ1 + ~2 · ρ2 + ...

,

(16)

|
where ρ0, ρ1, ρ2, ... are of zeroth order in ~ b. In reality, ‘classical distributions’ ρ0 do
not exist so that one has to deal with Eq. (16).

11 The Weyl transform of the von-Neumann equation

The Weyl transform of the von-Neumann equation is an evolution equation for ρwt.

(17)

(18)

where { , } is the usual Poisson bracket w.r.t. ~r and ~p and where repeated indices
are summed over. As in Eqs. (9) and (10) the second order parts of the Hamiltonian
drop out. The vector ~ξwt is the polarisation density and Eq. (18) is its Bloch
equation in ﬁrst order [3]. Note that these equations are not restricted to dipole
and quadrupole magnetic ﬁelds. It is the ρwt and ~ξwt which serve as the ‘classical
distribution functions’ which we have been seeking.

These equations are easily transformed from cartesian coordinates to ‘machine
coordinates’ since with the Weyl transform one only has to deal with c-numbers
instead of q-numbers [10]. After transforming to machine coordinates the zeroth order
limits of the transformed Eqs. (17) and (18) correspond to the classical Eqs. (17) and
(40) in Article I.

For FW transformations of the Dirac equation where time has been replaced by

the longitudinal coordinate in a paraxial approximation see [11].

12 Radiation

Now that the radiationless case is on a ﬁrm basis, one can include radiation. In a
classical treatment of radiation eﬀects one gets the Fokker-Planck and Bloch equations
of Eqs. (24) and (39) in Article I. To include the Sokolov-Ternov eﬀect one needs a
full quantum treatment [12].

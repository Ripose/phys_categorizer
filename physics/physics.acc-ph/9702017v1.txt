1.1 COMPARISON OF COLLIDER TYPES

1.1.1

Introduction

Before we discuss the muon collider in detail, it is useful to look at the other

types of colliders for comparison. In this chapter we consider the high energy physics

advantages, disadvantages and luminosity requirements of hadron (pp, p¯p), of lepton
(e+e−, µ+µ− ) and photon-photon colliders. Technical problems in obtaining increased
energy in each type of machine are presented. Their relative size, and probable relative

costs are discussed.

1.1.2 Physics Considerations

General. Hadron-hadron colliders (pp or p¯p) generate interactions between the

many constituents of the hadrons (gluons, quarks and antiquarks); the initial states are

not deﬁned and most interactions occur at relatively low energy, generating a very large

background of uninteresting events. The rate of the highest energy events is higher for

antiproton-proton machines, because the antiproton contains valence antiquarks that

can annihilate on the quarks in the proton. But this is a small eﬀect for colliders

above a few TeV, when the interactions are dominated by interactions between quarks

and antiquarks in their seas, and between the gluons.

In either case the individual

parton-parton interaction energies (the energies used for physics) are a relatively small

fraction of the total center of mass energy. This is a disadvantage when compared with

lepton machines. An advantage, however, is that all ﬁnal states are accessible. Many, if

not most, initial discoveries in Elementary Particle Physics have been made with these

machines.

In contrast, lepton-antilepton collider generate interactions between the funda-

mental point-like constituents in their beams, the reactions generated are relatively

simple to understand, the full machine energies are available for “physics”, and there

is negligible background of low energy events. If the center of mass energy is set equal

to the mass of a suitable state of interest, then there can be a large cross section in the

s-channel, in which a single state is generated by the interaction. In this case, the mass

and quantum numbers of the state are constrained by the initial beams. If the energy

spread of the beams is suﬃciently narrow, then precision determination of masses and

widths are possible.

A gamma-gamma collider, like the lepton-antilepton machines, would also have

all the machine energy available for physics, and would have well deﬁned initial states,

but these states would be diﬀerent from those with the lepton machines, and thus be

complementary to them.

For most purposes (technical considerations aside) e+e−and µ+µ− colliders would
be equivalent. But in the particular case of s-channel Higgs boson production, the cross

7

section, being proportional to the mass squared, is more than 40,000 times greater for

muons than electrons. When technical considerations are included, the situation is

more complicated. Muon beams are harder to polarize and muon colliders will have

much higher backgrounds from decay products of the muons. On the other hand muon

collider interactions will require less radiative correction and will have less energy spread

from beamstrahlung.

Each type of collider has its own advantages and disadvantages for High Energy

Physics: they would be complementary.

Required Luminosity for Lepton Colliders. In lepton machines the full center

of mass of the leptons is available for the ﬁnal state of interest and a “physics energy”
Ephy can be deﬁned that is equal to the total center of mass energy.

Ephy = Ec of m

(1)

(2)

Since fundamental cross sections fall as the square of the center of mass energies

involved, so, for a given rate of events, the luminosity of a collider must rise as the

square of its energy. A reasonable target luminosity is one that would give 10,000

events per unit of R per year (the cross section for lepton pair production is one R,

the total cross section is about 20 R, and somewhat energy dependent as new channels

open up):

Fig. 1 shows this required luminosity, together with crosses at the approximate achieved

luminosities of some lepton colliders. Target luminosities of possible future colliders are

also given as circles.

The Eﬀective Physics Energies of Hadron Colliders. Hadrons, being com-

posite, have their energy divided between their various constituents. A typical collision

of constituents will thus have signiﬁcantly less energy than that of the initial hadrons.

Studies done in Snowmass 82 and 96 suggest that, for a range of studies, and given the

required luminosity (as deﬁned in Eq. 2), then the hadron machine’s eﬀective “physics”

energy is between about 1/3 and 1/10 of its total. We will take a value of 1/7:

Lreq.)
The same studies have also concluded that a factor of 10 in luminosity is worth about

that this eﬀective physics energy is not a well deﬁned quantity. It should depend on the

physics being studied. The initial discovery of a new quark, like the top, can be made

with a signiﬁcantly lower “physics” energy than that given here. And the capabilities

of diﬀerent types of machines have intrinsic diﬀerences. The above analysis is useful

only in making very broad comparisons between machine types.

1.1.3 Hadron-Hadron Machines

Luminosity. An antiproton-proton collider requires only one ring, compared with

the two needed for a proton-proton machine (the antiproton has the opposite charge

to the proton and can thus rotate in the same magnet ring in the opposite direction -

protons going in opposite directions require two rings with bending ﬁelds of the opposite

sign), but the luminosity of an antiproton- proton collider is limited by the constraints
in antiproton production. A luminosity of at least 1032 cm−2s−1 is expected at the
antiproton-proton Tevatron; and a luminosity of 1033 cm−2s−1 may be achievable, but
LHC, a proton-proton machine, is planned to have a luminosity of 1034 cm−2s−1. Since
the required luminosity rises with energy, proton-proton machines seem to be favored

for future hadron colliders.

The LHC and other future proton-proton machines might even[1] be upgradable
to 1035 cm−2s−1, but radiation damage to a detector would then be a severe problem.
The 60 TeV Really Large Hadron Colliders (RLHC: high and low ﬁeld versions) dis-

cussed at Snowmass are being designed as proton-proton machines with luminosities of
1034 cm−2s−1 and it seems reasonable to assume that this is the highest practical value.

Size and Cost. The size of hadron-hadron machines is limited by the ﬁeld of the

magnets used in their arcs. A cost minimum is obtained when a balance is achieved

between costs that are linear in length, and those that rise with magnetic ﬁeld. The

optimum ﬁeld will depend on the technologies used both for the the linear components

(tunnel, access, distribution, survey, position monitors, mountings, magnet ends, etc)

and those of the magnets themselves, including the type of superconductor used.

The ﬁrst hadron collider, the 60 GeV ISR at CERN, used conventional iron pole

magnets at a ﬁeld less than 2 T. The only current hadron collider, the 2 TeV Tevatron,
at FNAL, uses NbTi superconducting magnets at approximately 4 ◦K giving a bending
ﬁeld of about 4.5 T. The 14 TeV Large Hadron Collider (LHC), under construction at
CERN, plans to use the same material at 1.8 ◦K yielding bending ﬁelds of about 8.5 T.
Future colliders may use new materials allowing even higher magnetic ﬁelds. Fig. 2

shows the critical current densities of various superconductors as a function of magnetic
ﬁeld. The numbers in parenthesis refer to the temperatures in ◦ K. good and bad refer
to the best and worst performance according to the orientation of the tape with respect
to the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld. Model magnets have been made with Nb3Sn, and
studies are underway on the use of high Tc superconductor. Bi2Sr2Ca1Cu2O8 (BSCCO)
material is currently available in useful lengths as powder-in-Ag tube processed tape.

It has a higher critical temperature and ﬁeld than conventional superconductors, but,
even at 4 ◦K, its current density is less than Nb3Sn at all ﬁelds below 15 T. It is thus
unsuitable for most accelerator magnets.
In contrast YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) material
has a current density above that for Nb3Sn (4 ◦K), at all ﬁelds and temperatures below

10

Figure 2. Critical current densities of superconductors as a function of magnetic ﬁeld.

20 ◦K. But this material must be deposited on specially treated metallic substrates and
is not yet available in lengths greater than 1 m. It is reasonable to assume, however,

that it will be available in useful lengths in the not too distant future.

A parametric study was undertaken to learn what the use of such materials might

do for the cost of colliders. 2-in-1 cosine theta superconducting magnet cross sections

(in which the two magnet coils are circular in cross section, have a cosine theta current

distributions and are both enclosed in a single iron yoke) were calculated using ﬁxed

criteria for margin, packing fraction, quench protection, support and ﬁeld return. Ma-

terial costs were taken to be linear in the weights of superconductor, copper stabilizer,

aluminum collars, iron yoke and stainless steel support tube. The cryogenic costs were

taken to be inversely proportional to the operating temperature, and linear in the outer

surface area of the cold mass. The values of the cost dependencies were scaled from

LHC estimates.

Results are shown in Fig. 3. Costs were calculated assuming NbTi at (a) 4 ◦K,
and (b) 1.8 ◦K, Nb3 Sn at (c) 4.3 ◦K and YBCO High Tc at 20 ◦K (d) and (e). NbTi
and Nb3 Sn costs per unit weight were taken to be the same; YBCO was taken to be
either equal to NbTi (in (d)), or 4 times NbTi (in (e)). It is seen that the optimum
ﬁeld moves from about 6 T for NbTi at 4 ◦K to about 12 T for YBCO at 20 ◦K; while
the total cost falls by almost a factor of 2.

One may note that the optimized cost per unit length remains approximately

11

Figure 3. Relative costs of a collider as a function of its bending magnetic ﬁeld, for diﬀerent
superconductors and operating temperatures. Costs are given for NbTi at (a) 4 ◦K, and (b) 1.8 ◦K,
(c) Nb3 Sn at 4.3 ◦K, and (d) and (e) YBCO High Tc at 20 ◦K. NbTi and Nb3 Sn costs per unit
weight were taken to be the same; YBCO was taken to be either equal to NbTi (in (d)), or 4 times
NbTi (in (e)).

constant. This might have been expected: at the cost minimum, the cost of linear and

ﬁeld dependent terms are matched, and the total remains about twice that of the linear

terms.

The above study assumes this particular type of magnet and may not be indicative

of the optimization for radically diﬀerent designs. A group at FNAL[2] is considering

an iron dominated, alternating gradient, continuous, single turn collider magnet design

(Low ﬁeld RLHC). Its ﬁeld would be only 2 T and circumference very large (350 km

for 60 TeV), but with its simplicity and with tunneling innovations, it is hoped to make

its cost lower than the smaller high ﬁeld designs. There are however greater problems

in achieving high luminosity with such a machine than with the higher ﬁeld designs.

1.1.4 Circular e+e−Machines

Luminosity. The luminosities of most circular electron-positron colliders has been
between 1031 and 1032 cm−2s−1 (see Fig.1), CESR is fast approaching 1033 cm−2s−1 and
machines are now being constructed with even high values. Thus, at least in principle,

luminosity does not seem to be a limitation (although it may be noted that the 0.2 TeV

electron-positron collider LEP has a luminosity below the requirement of Eq.2).

12

Size and Cost. At energies below 100 MeV, using a reasonable bending ﬁeld, the

size and cost of a circular electron machine is approximately proportional to its energy.
But at higher energies, if the bending ﬁeld B is maintained, the energy lost ∆Vturn to
synchrotron radiation rises rapidly

(4)

and soon becomes excessive (R is the radius of the ring). A cost minimum is then

obtained when the cost of the ring is balanced by the cost of the rf needed to replace

the synchrotron energy loss. If the ring cost is proportional to its circumference, and

the rf is proportional to its voltage then the size and cost of an optimized machine rises

as the square of its energy. This relationship is well demonstrated by the parameters

of actual machines as shown later in Fig. 7.

The highest circular e+e−collider is the LEP at CERN which has a circumference of
27 km, and will achieve a maximum center of mass energy of about 0.2 TeV. Using the

predicted scaling, a 0.5 TeV circular collider would have to have a 170 km circumference,

and would be very expensive.

1.1.5

e+e−Linear Colliders

Size and Cost. So, for energies much above that of LEP (0.2 TeV) it is probably

impractical to build a circular electron collider. The only possibility then is to build two

electron linacs facing one another. Interactions occur at the center, and the electrons,

after they have interacted, must be discarded.

where σx and σy are average beam spot sizes including any pinch eﬀects, and we take

Conventional RF. The gradients for structures have limits that are frequency

dependent. Fig. 4 shows the gradient limits from breakdown, fatigue and dark current

capture, plotted against the operating rf frequency. Operating gradients and frequencies

of several linear collider designs[6] are also indicated.

One sees that for conventional structure designs (indicated as squares in Fig. 4),

the proposed gradients fall well below the limits, except for the dark current capture

threshold. Above this threshold, in the absence of focusing ﬁelds, dark current electrons

emitted in one cavity can be captured and accelerated down the entire linac causing

loading problems. We note, however, that the superconducting TESLA design is well

above this limit, and a detailed study[7] has shown that the quadrupole ﬁelds in a

focusing structure eﬀectively stop the build up of such a current.

The real limit on accelerating gradients in these designs come from a trade oﬀ

between the cost of rf power against the cost of length. The use of high frequencies

reduces the stored energy in the cavities, reducing the rf costs and allowing higher accel-

erating gradients: the optimized gradients being roughly proportional to the frequency.

One might thus conclude then that higher frequencies should be preferred. There are

however counterbalancing considerations from the requirements of luminosity.

Fig. 5, using parameters from the linear collider proposals [6], plots some relevant

parameters against the rf frequency. One sees that as the frequencies rise,

14

Figure 4. Gradient values and limits in linear collider electron linacs, superconducting examples are

•

•

the required alignment tolerances are tighter;

the resolution of beam position monitors must also be better; and

despite these better alignments, the calculated emittance growth during acceler-

ation is worse; and

the wall-power to beam-power eﬃciencies are also less.

Thus while length and cost considerations may favor high frequencies, yet luminosity

considerations demand lower frequencies.

Superconducting RF. If, however, the rf costs can be reduced, for instance when

superconducting cavities are used, then there will be no trade oﬀ between rf power cost

and length and higher gradients should be expected to lower the length and cost. The

removal of the constraint applied by rf power considerations is evident for the TESLA

gradient plotted in Fig. 4. Its value is well above the trend of conventional rf designs.

Unfortunately the gradients achievable in currently operating niobium superconducting

cavities is lower than that planned in the higher frequency conventional rf colliders.

15

Figure 5. Dependence of some sensitive parameters as a function of linear collider rf frequency.

Theoretically the limit is about 40 MV/m, but practically 25 MV/m is as high as
seems possible. Nb3Sn and high Tc materials may allow higher ﬁeld gradients in the
future. A possible value for Nb3Sn is also indicated on Fig. 4.

In either case, the removal of the requirements for huge peak rf power allows

the choice of longer wavelengths (the TESLA collaboration is proposing 23 cm at 1.3

GHz) and greatly relieves the emittance requirements and tolerances, with no loss of

luminosity.

At the current 25 MeV per meter gradients, the length and cost of a supercon-

ducting machine is probably higher than for the conventional rf designs. With greater

luminosity more certain, its proponents can argue that it is worth it the greater price.

If higher gradients become possible, using new superconductors, then the advantages

of a superconducting solution could become overwhelming.

At Higher Energies. At higher energies (as expected from Eq. 9), obtaining the

required luminosity gets harder. Fig.6 shows the dependency of some example machine

parameters with energy. SLC is taken as the example at 0.1 TeV, NLC parameters at

0.5 and 1 TeV, and 5 and 10 TeV examples are taken from a review paper by one of

the authors[5]. One sees that:

16

the assumed beam power rises approximately as E;

the vertical spot sizes fall approximately as E−2;

the vertical normalized emittances fall even faster: E−2.5; and

•

•

•

•

the momentum spread due to beamstrahlung has been allowed to rise almost

linearly with E.

These trends are independent of the acceleration method, frequency, etc, and in-

dicate that as the energy and required luminosity rise, so the required beam powers,

eﬃciencies, emittances and tolerances will all get harder to achieve. The use of higher

frequencies or exotic technologies that would allow the gradient to rise, will, in general,

make the achievement of the required luminosity even more diﬃcult. It may well prove

impractical to construct linear electron-positron colliders, with adequate luminosity, at

energies above a few TeV.

1.1.6

γ

γ Colliders

−

A gamma-gamma collider[8] would use opposing electron linacs, as in a linear

electron collider, but just prior to the collision point, laser beams would be Compton

backscattered oﬀ the electrons to generate photon beams that would collide at the

IP instead of the electrons. If suitable geometries are used, the mean photon-photon

energy could be 80% or more of that of the electrons, with a luminosity about 1/10th.

If the electron beams, after they have backscattered the photons, are deﬂected,
then backgrounds from beamstrahlung can be eliminated. The constraint on N/σx in
Eq.5 is thus removed and one might hope that higher luminosities would now be possi-
ble by raising N and lowering σx. Unfortunately, to do this, one needs sources of larger
number of electron bunches with smaller emittances, and one must ﬁnd ways to acceler-

ate and focus such beams without excessive emittance growth. Conventional damping

rings will have diﬃculty doing this[9]. Exotic electron sources would be needed, and

methods using lasers to generate[10] or cool[11] the electrons and positrons are under

consideration.

Thus, although gamma-gamma collisions can and should be made available at any

future electron-positron linear collider, to add physics capability, they may not give

higher luminosity for a given beam power.

1.1.7 µ+µ− Colliders

There are two advantages of muons, as opposed to electrons, for a lepton collider.

The synchrotron radiation, that forces high energy electron colliders to be linear,

is (see Eq. 4) inversely proportional to the fourth power of mass: It is negligible

in muon colliders with energy less than 10 TeV. Thus a muon collider, up to such

energy, can be circular. In practice this means in can be smaller. The linacs for

a 0.5 TeV NLC would be 20 km long. The ring for a muon collider of the same

energy would be only about 1.2 km circumference.

The luminosity of a muon collider is given by the same formula (Eq. 5) as given

above for an electron positron collider, but there are two signiﬁcant changes: 1)
The classical radius ro is now that for the muon and is 200 times smaller; and
2) the number of collisions a bunch can make ncollisions is no longer 1, but is now
related to the average bending ﬁeld in the muon collider ring, with

ncollisions ≈

150 Bave

With an average ﬁeld of 6 Tesla, ncollisions ≈
muons an in principle luminosity advantage of more than 105.

900. Thus these two eﬀects give

•

•

18

As a result of these gains, the required beam power, spot sizes, emittances and
energy spread are far less in µ+µ− colliders than in e+e−machines of the same energy.
The comparison is made in Fig. 6 above.

But there are problems with the use of muons:

Muons can be best be obtained from the decay of pions, made by higher energy

protons impinging on a target. A high intensity proton source is thus required

and very eﬃcient capture and decay of these pions is essential.

Because the muons are made with very large emittance, they must be cooled

and this must be done very rapidly because of their short lifetime. Conventional

synchrotron, electron, or stochastic cooling is too slow. Ionization cooling is the

only clear possibility, but does not cool to very low emittances.

Because of their short lifetime, conventional synchrotron acceleration would be

too slow. Recirculating accelerators or pulsed synchrotrons must be used.

Because they decay while stored in the collider, muons radiate the ring and de-

tector with their decay products. Shielding is essential and backgrounds will

certainly be signiﬁcant.

These problems and their possible solutions will be discussed in more detail in the

following chapters. Parameters will be given there of a 4 TeV center of mass collider,

and of a 0.5 TeV demonstration machine.

1.1.8 Comparison of Machines

Length. In Fig. 7, the eﬀective physics energies (as deﬁned by Eq. 3) of represen-

tative machines are plotted against their total tunnel lengths. We note:

Hadrons Colliders: It is seen that the energies of machines rise with their size, but
L1.3). This extra rise is a reﬂection of
that this rise is faster than linear (Eeﬀ ∝
the steady increase in bending magnetic ﬁelds used as technologies and materials

have become available.

Circular Electron-Positron Colliders: The energies of these machines rise approx-

imately as the square root of their size, as expected from the cost optimization

discussed above.

Linear Electron-Positron Colliders: The SLC is the only existing machine of this

type and only one example of a proposed machine (the NLC) is plotted. The line

drawn has the same slope as for the hadron machines and implies a similar rise

in accelerating gradient, as technologies advance.

Muon-Muon Colliders: Only the 4 TeV collider, discussed above, and the 0.5 TeV
demonstration machine have been plotted. The line drawn has the same slope as
for the hadron machines.

It is noted that the muon collider oﬀers the greatest energy per unit length. This

is also apparent in Fig. 8, in which the footprints of a number of proposed machines

are given on the same scale. But does this mean it will give the greatest energy per

unit of cost ?

Cost. Fig. 9 plots the cost of a sample of machines against their size. Before

examining this plot, be warned: the numbers you will see will not be the ones you are

familiar with. The published numbers for diﬀerent projects use diﬀerent accounting

procedures and include diﬀerent items in their costs. Not very exact corrections and

escalation have been made to obtain estimates of the costs under ﬁxed criteria: 1996 $’s,

US accounting, no detectors or halls. The resulting numbers, as plotted, must be

considered to have errors of at least

20%.

±

The costs are seen to be surprisingly well represented by a straight line. Circular

electron machines, as expected, lie signiﬁcantly lower. The only plotted muon collider

(the 0.5 TeV demonstration machine’s very preliminary cost estimate) lies above the

line. But the clear indication is that length is, or at least has been, a good estimator

of approximate cost. It is interesting to note that the ﬁtted line indicates costs rising,

not linearly, but as the 0.85 th power of length. This can be taken as a measure of

economies of scale.

The LHC is a well optimized and appropriate next step towards high eﬀective
physics energy.

A Very Large Hadron Collider with energy greater than the SSC (e.g. 60 TeV

c-of-m) and cost somewhat less than the SSC, may well be possible with the use
of high Tc superconductors that may become available.

A “Next Linear Collider” is the only clean way to complement the LHC with

a lepton machine, and the only way to do so soon. But it appears that even a

0.5 TeV collider will be more expensive than the LHC, and it will be technically

challenging: obtaining the design luminosity may not be easy.

•

Extrapolating conventional rf e+e−linear colliders to energies above 1 or 2 TeV
will be very diﬃcult. Raising the rf frequency can reduce length and probably cost

for a given energy, but obtaining luminosity increasing as the square of energy,

as required, may not be feasible.

Laser driven accelerators are becoming more realistic and can be expected to have

a signiﬁcantly lower cost per TeV. But the ratio of luminosity to wall power and

the ability to preserve very small emittances, is likely to be signiﬁcantly worse

than for conventional rf driven machines. Colliders using such technologies are

thus unlikely to achieve very high luminosities and are probably unsuitable for

higher (above 2 TeV) energy physics research.

A higher gradient superconducting Linac collider using Nb3Sn or high Tc materi-
als, if it becomes technically possible, could be the only way to attain the required
luminosities in a higher energy e+e−collider.

Gamma-gamma collisions can and should be obtained at any future electron-

positron linear collider. They would add physics capability to such a machine,

but, despite their freedom from the beamstrahlung constraint, may not achieve

higher luminosity.

A Muon Collider, being circular, could be far smaller than a conventional electron-

positron collider of the same energy. Very preliminary estimates suggest that it

would also be signiﬁcantly cheaper. The ratio of luminosity to wall power for

such machines, above 2 TeV, appears to be better than that for electron positron

22

machines, and extrapolation to a center of mass energy of 4 TeV or above does

not seem unreasonable. If research and development can show that it is practical,
then a 0.5 TeV muon collider could be a useful complement to e+e−colliders, and,
at higher energies (e.g. 4 TeV), could be a viable alternative.

1.2 PHYSICS CONSIDERATIONS

1.2.1

Introduction

•

•

•

•

•

•

The physics opportunities and possibilities of the muon collider have been well

documented in the Feasibility Study[12] and by additional papers[13]. For most re-
actions the physics capabilities of µ+µ− and e+e− colliders with the same energy and
luminosity are similar, so that the choice between them will depend mainly on the

feasibility and cost of the accelerators. But for some reactions, the larger muon mass

does provide some advantages:

The suppression of synchrotron radiation induced by the opposite bunch (beam-

strahlung) allows, in principle, the use of beams with very low momentum spread

QED radiation is reduced by a factor of [ln(√s/mµ)/ ln(√s/me)]2, leading to
smaller γγ backgrounds and a smaller eﬀective beam energy spread.

s-channel Higgs production is enhanced by a factor of (mµ/me)2

40000.

≈

The suppression of synchrotron radiation, allowing acceleration and storage of

muons in a ring, combined with the suppression of beamstrahlung, may allow the
construction of µ+µ− colliders at higher energy than e+e−machines.

The disadvantages are:

Less polarization appears practical in a µ+µ− collider than in an e+e−machine,
and some luminosity loss is likely.

The µ+µ− machine will have considerably worse background and probably require
a shielding cone, extending down to the vertex, that takes up a larger solid angle
than that needed in an e+e−collider.

In the following sections we will give examples of physics for which there is a
advantage in µ+µ− . These examples are taken from the discussion in section II of
the µ+µ− Collider Feasibility Study [12]. For a discussion of the other physics, SUSY
particle identiﬁcation in particular, the reader is refered to the physics sections of the

Next Linear Collider Zeroth Order Design Report (ZDR)[14].

Precision Threshold Studies. The high energy resolution and suppression of
Initial State Radiation (ISR) in a µ+µ− collider makes it particularly well suited to
threshold studies. As an example, Fig. 10 shows the threshold curves for top quark
production for both µ+µ− and e+e−machines, with and without beam smearing. (An
rms energy spread of 1 % is assumed for e+e−and 0.1 % for µ+µ− ). The rms mass
resolution ∆mt obtained with 10 fb−1in a µ+µ− Collider is estimated to be
0.3 GeV.
This can be compared with 4 GeV for the Tevatron, 2 GeV for the LHC, and 0.5 GeV

e+e−and 0.1 % for µ+µ− ).

Studies of Standard Model, or SUSY Model Light, Higgs h. The feature
that has attracted most theoretical interest is the possibility of s-channel studies of

Higgs production. This is possible with µ’s, but not with e’s, due to the strong coupling

of muons to the Higgs channel that is proportional to the mass of the lepton. If the

Higgs sector is more complex than just a simple standard model (SM) Higgs, it will

be necessary to measure the widths and quantum numbers of any newly discovered

particles to ascertain the nature of those particles and the structure of the theory. In

addition to the increased coupling strength of the muons, the beamstrahlung is much

reduced for muons allowing much better deﬁnition of the beam energy.

The cross sections for Higgs production with a µ+µ− collider are substantial.
Fig. 11 shows a) the Higgs signal, b) the background, and c) the luminosity required

for a 5 σ signal signiﬁcance, for two diﬀerent rms energy spreads of the muon beam:
0.01 % and 0.06 %. Signals are shown for three ﬁnal states: b¯b, WW(∗) and ZZ(∗)
(reconstructable, non- 4 jet, with channel isolation eﬃciency ǫ = 0.5). It is seen that:

For an rms energy resolution of 0.01 %, a luminosity of only 0.1 f b−1 is required
to yield a detectable signal for all mhSM above the current LEP limit, except in
the region of the Z peak, where 1 f b−1 is required.

For an rms energy resolution of 0.06 %, the luminosity required is 20- 30 times

larger, indicating that the higher resolution is desirable even at signiﬁcant loss of

luminosity.

Fig. 12 shows the total widths of standard model and MSSM Higgs. In the case
of MSSM masses are plotted for the stop quark mass mstop = 1 TeV, tan β = 2 and
20. Two loop corrections have been included, but no squark mixing or SUSY decay

channels.

The standard model Higgs with mass below mt is seen to be very narrow. For
3 MeV. A Supersymmetric model Higgs would be wider, but might

Higgs to determine its character. It has been shown that a muon collider with an rms

energy spread of 0.01 % could measure the width of a 110 GeV standard model Higgs

to

1 MeV with only 2 inverse femtobarns. Only if the Higgs mass is close to that of

the Z does it become diﬃcult to make such a determination without a large amount

of data (200 inverse femtobarns). This could be a very important measurement (that

could not be done in any other way) since it would destinguish clearly the nature of the

boson seen. Together with branching ratio measurements (also possible with a muon

collider), it could even predict the mass of the other SUSY Higgs bosons: H and A.

or µµ to determine the Z rate. Clearly there is a real challenge to try to measure the

hadronic modes.

The background from γγ and γZ processes is smaller at a muon collider than at
an electron collider but not negligible. Since the pT of the photons is usually very small
while the W W fusion process typically gives a pT of order MW , these backgrounds can
be reduced by making a cut pT,W W > 50 GeV. This cut keeps most of the signal while
signiﬁcantly reducing the physics background.

Summary. For many reactions, SUSY particle discovery for example, an e+e−collider,

with its higher polarization and lower background, would be preferable to a µ+µ− ma-
chine of the same energy and luminosity. There are however speciﬁc reactions, s-channel
Higgs production for example, where the µ+µ− machine would have unique capabilities.
Ideally both machines would be built and they would be complementary. Whether both

machines could be built, at both moderate and multi TeV energies, and whether both

could be aﬀorded, remains to be determined.

There are several hardware questions that must be carefully studied. The ﬁrst is

the question of the luminosity available when the beam momentum spread is decreased.

In addition there will have to be good control of the injected beam energy as there

is not time to make large adjustments in the collider ring. Precision determination

28

(cid:13)
of the energy and energy spread will be mandatory: presumably by the study of spin

precession. Finally, the question of luminosity vs. percent polarization needs additional

study; unlike the electron collider, both beams can be polarized but as shown later in

this report, but the luminosity decreases as the polarization increases.

1.3 MUON COLLIDER COMPONENTS

1.3.1

Introduction

The possibility of muon colliders was introduced by Skrinsky et al.[15] and Neuﬀer[16]

and has been aggressively developed over the past two years in a series of meetings and

workshops[17, 18, 19, 20].

A collaboration, lead by BNL, FNAL and LBNL, with contributions from 18 insti-

tutions has been studying a 4 TeV, high luminosity scenario and presented a Feasibility

Study[12] to the 1996 Snowmass Workshop. The basic parameters of this machine are

shown schematically in Fig. 15 and given in Tb. 2. Fig. 16 shows a possible layout of

such a machine.

Tb. 2 also gives the parameters of a 0.5 TeV demonstration machine based on the

AGS as an injector. It is assumed that a demonstration version based on upgrades of

the FERMILAB, or CERN machines would also be possible.

The main components of the 4 TeV collider would be:

•

•

•

•

•

A proton source with KAON like parameters (30 GeV, 1014 protons per pulse, at
15 Hz).

A liquid metal target surrounded by a 20 T hybrid solenoid to make and capture

pions.

A 5 T solenoidal channel within a sequence of rf cavities to allow the pions to

decay into muons and, at the same time, decelerate the fast ones that come ﬁrst,

while accelerating the lower momentum ones that come later. Muons from pions

in the 100-500 MeV range emerge in a 6 m long bunch at 150

30 MeV.

±

A solenoidal snake and collimator to select the momentum, and thus polarization,

of the muons.

A sequence of 20 ionization cooling stages, each consisting of: a) energy loss mate-

rial in a strong focusing environment for transverse cooling; b) linac reacceleration

and c) lithium wedges in a dispersive environment for cooling in momentum space.

A linac and/or recirculating linac pre-accelerator, followed by a sequence of pulsed

ﬁeld synchrotron accelerators using superconducting linacs for rf.

In order to reduce the cost of the muon phase rotation section, minimize the ﬁnal

muon longitudinal phase space and maximize the achievable polarization,, it appears

that the ﬁnal proton bunch length should be of the order of 1 ns. Is this practical ?

There appears to be a relationship between the number of protons in a bunch

and the longitudinal phase space of that bunch that can be maintained stability in a

circular machine. Fig. 17 shows values obtained and those planned in a number of

machines. The conservative assumption is that phase space densities will be similar to
those already achieved: around 2 eV seconds per 1013 protons, as indicated by the line
in Fig. 17. The required bunches of 2.5 1013 protons would thus be expected to have a
phase space of 5 eVs (at 95%) = 6π σtσE eVs rms. A 1 ns rms bunch at 30 GeV with
this phase space will have an rms momentum spread of 0.8 %, (2 % at 95%), and the

space charge tune shift just before extraction would be

0.5. Provided the rotation can

be performed rapidly enough, this should not be a problem. For the 0.5 TeV machine

≈

the bunch intensity, and thus area, would be double, leading to a ﬁnal spread of 1.6 %

An attractive technique[22] for bunch compression would be to generate a large

momentum spread with modest rf at a ﬁnal energy close to transition. Pulsed quads

would then be employed to move the operating point away from transition, resulting

rms (4 % at 95 %).

in rapid compression.

machines, circles proposed machines, and stars the values used here

Earlier studies had suggested that the driver could be a 10 GeV machine with the

same charge per ﬁll, but a repetition rate of 30 Hz. This speciﬁcation was almost iden-

tical to that studied[23] at ANL for a spallation neutron source. Studies at FNAL[24]

have further established that such a speciﬁcation is reasonable. But if 10 GeV protons

same pion production: 5

are used, then approximately twice as many protons per bunch are required for the
1014 per bunch for
the 0.5 TeV case; the phase space of the bunches would be expected to be twice as big

and the resulting % momentum spread for the 1 ns bunch 6 times as large: i.e. 12 %

(at 95%) which may be hard to achieve. For the 0.5 TeV speciﬁcation, this rises to 24
%: clearly unreasonable.

Other programs[26],[27] do not predict such a large low energy peak,(see for in-

stance Fig. 19) and there is currently very little data to indicate which is right. An

34

experiment (E910)[28][29], currently running at the AGS, should decide this question,

and thus settle at which energy the capture should be optimized.

Target. For a low repetition rate the target could probably be made of Cu, ap-

proximately 24 cm long by 2 cm diameter. A study[30] indicates that, with a 3 mm rms

beam, the single pulse instantaneous temperature rise is acceptable, but, if cooling is

only supplied from the outside, the equilibrium temperature, at our required repetition

rate, would be excessive. Some method must be provided to give cooling within the

target volume. For instance, the target could be made of a stack of relatively thin cop-

per disks, with water cooling between them. A graphite target could be used, but with

signiﬁcant loss of pion production, or a liquid metal target. Liquid lead and gallium are

under consideration. In order to avoid shock damage to a container, the liquid could

be in the form of a jet.

Figure 20. The muon to proton ratio as a function of the skew angle for a target whose length and
transverse position has been reoptimized for the skew case. The single x indicates the production
ratio at zero angle with the original optimization.

It appears that for maximum muon yield, the target (and incoming beam) should

be at an angle to the axis of the solenoid and outgoing beam. The introduction of such

an angle reduces the loss of pions when they reenter the target after being focused by

the solenoid. A Monte Carlo simulation[31] gave a muon production increase of 60 %

with at an angle 150 milliradians. The simulation assumed a copper target (interaction

length 15 cm), ARC[25] pion production spectra, a ﬁxed pion absorption cross section,

no secondary pion production, a 1 cm target radius, and the capture solenoid, decay

35

channel, phase rotation and bunch deﬁning cuts described below. Fig. 20 shows the

ﬁnal muon to proton ratio as a function of the skew angle for a target whose length

(45 cm) and transverse position (front end displaced - 1.5 cm from the axis) had been

reoptimized for the skew case. The single X indicates the production ratio at zero

angle with the original optimization (target length 30 cm, on axis). One notes that the

reoptimized target length is 3 interaction lengths long, and thus absorbs essentially all

of the initial protons.

Capture. Several capture methods were studied[32]. Pulsed horns were eﬀective

at the capture of very high energy pions. Multiple lithium lenses were more eﬀective at

lower pion energies, but neither was as eﬀective as a high ﬁeld solenoid at the 100 MeV

peak of the pion spectrum. Initially, a 15 cm diameter, 28 T ﬁeld was considered. Such

a magnet could probably be built using superconducting outer coils and a Bitter, or

other immersed sheet conductor inner coil, but such an immersed coil would probably

have limited life[33]. A 15 cm diameter, 20 T solenoid could use a more conventional

hollow conductor inner coil and was thus chosen despite the loss of 24 % pion capture

(see Fig. 21)

Figure 21. The muon to proton ratio as a function of capture solenoid ﬁeld

A preliminary design[33] (see Fig. 22) has an inner Bitter magnet with an inside

diameter of 24 cm (space is allowed for a 4 cm heavy metal shield inside the coil)

and an outside diameter of 60 cm; it provides half (10T) of the total ﬁeld, and would

consume approximately 8 MW. The superconducting magnet has a set of three coils,

all with inside diameters of 70 cm and is designed to give 10 T at the target and provide

36

the required tapered ﬁeld to match into the periodic superconducting solenoidal decay

channel (5 T and radius = 15 cm). A similar design has been made at LBL[34].

A new design[35] using a hollow conductor insert is now in progress. The resistive

coil would give 6 T and consume 4 MW. The superconducting coils will supply 14 T.

Figure 22. Schematic of a hybrid magnet solenoid system for π capture and matching.

Monte Carlo studies indicate a yield of 0.4–0.6 muons, of each sign, per initial

proton, captured in the decay channel. Surprisingly, this conclusion seems relatively

independent of whether the system is optimized for energies of 50 to 500 MeV (using

ARC), or 200 to 2000 MeV (using MARS).

Use of Both Signs. Protons on the target produce pions of both signs, and a

solenoid will capture both, but the required subsequent phase rotation rf systems will

have opposite eﬀects on each. One solution is to break the proton bunch into two, aim

them on the same target one after the other, and adjust the rf phases such as to act

correctly on one sign of the ﬁrst bunch and on the other sign of the second. This is the

solution assumed in the parameters of this paper.

A second possibility would be to separate the charges into two channels, delay

the particles of one charge by introducing a chicane in one of the channels, and then

recombine the two channels so that the particles of the two charges are in line, but

separated longitudinally (i.e. box cared). Both charges can now be phase rotated by a

single linac with appropriate phases of rf.

37

A third solution is to separate the pions of each charge prior to the use of rf, and

feed the beams of each charge into diﬀerent channels.

In either of the latter two solutions, there is a problem in separating the beams.

After the target, and prior to the use of any rf or cooling, the beams have very large

emittances and energy spread. Conventional charge separation using a dipole is not

practical. But if a solenoidal channel is bent, then the particles trapped within that

channel will drift[30],[36], in a direction perpendicular to the bend (this eﬀect is dis-

cussed in more detail in the section on Options below). With our parameters this drift

is dominated by a term (curvature drift) that is linear with the forward momentum of

the particles, and has a direction that depends on the sign of the charges. If suﬃcient

bend is employed[30], the two charges could be separated by a septum and captured

into two separate channels. When these separate channels are bent back to the same

forward direction, the momentum dispersion is separately removed in each new channel.

Although this idea is very attractive, it has some problems:

•

If the initial beam has a radius r=0.15 m, and if the momentum range to be
accepted is F = pmax
pmin = 3, then the required height of the solenoid just prior to
separation is 2(1+F)r=1.2 m. Use of a lesser height will result in particle loss.
Typically, the reduction in yield for a curved solenoid compared to a straight

solenoid is about 25 % (due to the loss of very low and very high momentum

pions), but this must be weighed against the fact that both charge signs are

captured for each proton on target.

•

The system of bend, separation, and return bend will require signiﬁcant length

and must occur prior to the start of phase rotation (see below). Unfortunately,

it appears that the cost of the phase rotation rf is strongly dependent on keeping

this distance as short as possible.

Clearly, compromises will be involved, and more study of this concept is required.

1.3.4 Phase Rotation Linac

The pions, and the muons into which they decay, have an energy spread from about

0 - 500 MeV, with an rms/mean of

100%, and peak at about 100 MeV. It would

be diﬃcult to handle such a wide spread in any subsequent system. A linac is thus

≈

introduced along the decay channel, with frequencies and phases chosen to deaccelerate

the fast particles and accelerate the slow ones; i.e. to phase rotate the muon bunch.

Tb. 4 gives an example of parameters of such a linac. It is seen that the lowest frequency

is 30 MHz, a low but not impossible frequency for a conventional structure.

A design of a reentrant 30 MHz cavity is shown in Fig.23. Its parameters are given

in Tb.5. It has a diameter of approximately 2 m, only about one third of that of a

conventional pill-box cavity. To keep its cost down, it would be made of aluminum.

Multipactoring would probably be suppressed by stray ﬁelds from the 5 T focusing

coils, but could also be controlled by an internal coating of titanium nitride.

Figs. 24 and 25 show the energy vs. c t at the end of the decay channel with and

without phase rotation. Note that the c t scales are very diﬀerent: the rotation both

compacts the energy spread and limits the growth of the bunch length.

After this phase rotation, a bunch can be selected with mean energy 150 MeV, rms
bunch length 1.7 m, and rms momentum spread 20 % (95 %, ǫL = 3.2 eVs). The number
of muons per initial proton in this selected bunch is 0.35, about half the total number

of pions initially captured. As noted above, since the linacs cannot phase rotate both
signs in the same bunch, we need two bunches: the phases are set to rotate the µ+’s of
one bunch and the µ−’s of the other. Prior to cooling, the bunch is accelerated to 300
MeV, in order to reduce the momentum spread to 10 %.

1.3.5 Cooling

For a collider, the phase-space volume must be reduced within the µ lifetime.

Cooling by synchrotron radiation, conventional stochastic cooling and conventional

electron cooling are all too slow. Optical stochastic cooling[37], electron cooling in a

39

plasma discharge[38] and cooling in a crystal lattice[39] are being studied, but appear

very diﬃcult. Ionization cooling[40] of muons seems relatively straightforward.

Ionization Cooling Theory. In ionization cooling, the beam loses both trans-

verse and longitudinal momentum as it passes through a material medium. Subse-

quently, the longitudinal momentum can be restored by coherent reacceleration, leaving

a net loss of transverse momentum. Ionization cooling is not practical for protons and

electrons because of nuclear interactions (p’s) and bremsstrahlung (e’s), but is practical

for µ’s because of their low nuclear cross section and relatively low bremsstrahlung.

where ǫn is the normalized emittance, β⊥ is the betatron function at the absorber,
dEµ/ds is the energy loss, and LR is the radiation length of the material. The ﬁrst
term in this equation is the coherent cooling term, and the second is the heating due
to multiple scattering. This heating term is minimized if β⊥ is small (strong-focusing)
and LR is large (a low-Z absorber). From Eq. 10 we ﬁnd a limit to transverse cooling,

where the ﬁrst term is the cooling (or heating) due to energy loss, and the second term

Cooling requires that d(dEµ/ds)

> 0. But at energies below about 200 MeV, the
energy loss function for muons, dEµ/ds, is decreasing with energy and there is thus
heating of the beam. Above 400 MeV the energy loss function increases gently, giving

dEµ

some cooling, but not suﬃcient for our application.

Energy spread can also be reduced by artiﬁcially increasing d(dEµ/ds)

by placing

dEµ

a transverse variation in absorber density or thickness at a location where position is

energy dependent, i.e. where there is dispersion. The use of such wedges can reduce

energy spread, but it simultaneously increases transverse emittance in the direction

of the dispersion. Six dimensional phase space is not reduced, but it does allow the

exchange of emittance between the longitudinal and transverse directions.

In the long-path-length Gaussian-distribution limit, the heating term (energy strag-

gling) is given by[41]

increases as γ2, and the cooling system size scales as γ, cooling at low energies is
desired.

1.3.6 Low β⊥ Lattices for Cooling

We have seen from the above that for a low equilibrium emittance we require
energy loss in a strong focusing (low β⊥) region. Three sources of strong focusing have
been studied:

Solenoid. The simplest solution would appear to be the use of a long high ﬁeld

solenoid in which both acceleration and energy loss material could be contained. There

is, however, a problem: when particles enter a solenoid other than on the axis, they

are given angular momentum by the radial ﬁeld components that they must pass.

This initial angular momentum is proportional to the solenoid ﬁeld strength, and to

the particles’ radius.

In the absence of material, this extra angular momentum is

maintained proportional to the tracks’ radius as they pass along the solenoid until they

are exactly corrected by the radial ﬁelds at the exit. But if material is introduced,

all transverse momenta are “cooled”, including the extra angular momentum given by

42

these radial ﬁelds. When the cooled particles now leave the solenoid, then the end

ﬁelds overcorrect them, leaving the particles with a ﬁnite added angular momentum.

In practice, this angular momentum is equivalent to a signiﬁcant heating term that

limits the maximum emittance reduction to a quite small factor. The problem can only

be averted if the direction of the solenoid ﬁeld is periodically reversed.

Alternating Solenoid (FOFO) Lattice. An interesting case of such periodic

solenoid ﬁeld reversals is a lattice with rapid reversal that, for example, might ap-

proximate sinusoidal variations. We describe such a lattice as FOFO (focus focus) in

analogy with quadrupole lattices that are FODO (focus defocus). Not only do such

lattices avoid the angular momentum problems of a long solenoid, but they can, if the
phase advance per cell approaches π, provide β⊥’s at the zero ﬁeld points, that are less
than the same ﬁeld would provide in the long solenoid case.

But as noted above, for cooling to be eﬀective, the ratio of emittance to β⊥ must
remain above a given value. This implies that the angular amplitude of the particles

has to be relatively large (typically greater than 0.1 radians rms). When tracking of

such distributions was performed on realistic lattices three apparent problems were

observed:

1. Particles entering with large amplitude (radius or angle) were found[42] to be lost

or reﬂected by the fringe ﬁelds of the lenses. The basic problem is that there are

strong non-linear eﬀects that focus the large angle particles more strongly than

those at small angles (this is known as a second order tune shift). The stronger

focus causes an increase in the phase advance per cell resulting in resonant be-

havior, emittance growth and particle loss.

2. A bunch, even when monoenergetic, passing along such a lattice would be seen[43]

to rapidly grow in length because the larger amplitude particles, traveling longer

orbits, would fall behind the small amplitude ones.

3. With material present, the energy spread of a bunch grew because the high ampli-

tude particles were passing through more material than the low amplitude ones.

Surprisingly however, none of these turns out to be a real problem. If the particles

are matched, as they must be, into rf buckets, then all particles at the centers of these

buckets must be traveling with the same average forward velocity.

If this were not

so then they would be arriving at the next rf cavity with diﬀerent phases and would

not be at the center of the bucket.

It follows that large amplitude particles (whose

trajectories are longer) must have higher momenta than those with lower amplitude.

The generation of this correlation is part of the matching requirement, and would be

43

naturally generated if an adiabatic application of FOFO strength were introduced. It

could also be generated by a suitable gradation of the average radial absorber density.

Since higher amplitude particles will thus have higher momenta, they will, as a

result, be less strongly focused: an eﬀect of the opposite sign to the second order tune

shift natural to the lattice. Can the eﬀects cancel ? In practice they are found to cancel

almost exactly at a speciﬁc momentum: close to 100 MeV/c for a continuous sinusoidal

FOFO lattice (the exact momentum will depend on the lattice).

A second, but only partial, cancelation also occurs: the higher amplitude, and

now higher momentum, particles lose less energy in the absorber because of the natural

energy dependence of the energy loss. This diﬀerence of energy loss, at 100 MeV/c,

actually overcorrects the diﬀerence in energy loss from the diﬀerence in trajectories in

the material. But this too is no problem. The natural bucket center for large amplitude

particles will be displaced not only up in energy, but also over in phase, so as to be

in a diﬀerent accelerating ﬁeld, and thus maintain their energy. Again, this would

occur naturally if the lattice is introduced adiabatically and can also be generated by a

combination of radially graded absorbers and drifts. Particles of diﬀering momentum

or phase will, as in normal synchrotron oscillation, gyrate about their bucket centers,

but now each amplitude has a diﬀerent center.

Using particles so matched, a simulation using fully Maxwellian sinusoidal ﬁeld has

been shown to give continuous transverse cooling without signiﬁcant particle loss (see

Fig. 26). In this simulation, the axial ﬁeld has been gradually increased, and its period

decreased, so as to maintain a constant rms angular spread as the emittance falls. The

peak rf accelerating ﬁelds were 10 MeV/m, their frequency 750 MHz, the absorbing

material was lithium, placed at the zero magnetic ﬁeld positions, with lengths such

that they occupied 5 % of the length. The mean momentum was 110 MeV/c, and rms

width 2 %. 500 particles were tracked; none were lost.

Lithium Rods. The third method of providing strong focusing and energy loss

is to pass the particles along a current carrying lithium rod (a long lithium lens). The
rod serves simultaneously to maintain the low β⊥, and attenuate the beam momenta.
Similar lithium rods, with surface ﬁelds of 10 T , were developed at Novosibirsk[44] and

have been used as focusing elements at FNAL[45] and CERN[46]. At the repetition

rates required here, cooling of a solid rod will not be possible, and circulating liquid

columns will have to be used. A small lens using such liquid cooling has also been

tested at Novosibirsk. It is also hoped[47] that because of the higher compressibility of

the liquid, surface ﬁeld up to 20 T may be possible.

Lithium lenses will permit smaller β⊥ and therefore cooling to lower emittances
than in a practicable FOFO lattice, and such rods are thus preferred for the ﬁnal cooling

stages. But they are pulsed devices and consequently they are likely to have signiﬁcant

44

Figure 26. Cooling in a FOFO Lattice: (a) rms radius; (b) normalized emittance; and (c) axial

life time problems, and are thus not preferred for the earlier stages where they are not

absolutely needed.

Such rods do not avoid the second order tune shift complications discussed above

for the FOFO lattices. The rods must be alternated with acceleration sections and thus

the particles must periodically be focused into and out of the rods. All three of the

nonlinear eﬀects enumerated above will be encountered. It is reasonable to believe that

they can be controlled by the same mechanisms, but a full simulation of this has not

yet been done.

Emittance Exchange Wedges. Emittance exchange in wedges to reduce the

longitudinal emittance has been modeled with Monte Carlo calculations and works as

45

theoretically predicted. But the lattices needed to generate the required dispersions and

focus the particles onto the wedges have yet to be designed. The nonlinear complications

discussed above will again have to be studied and corrected.

Emittance exchange in a bent current carrying rod has also been studied, both

for a rod of uniform density[48] (in which the longer path length on the outside of the

helix plays the role of a wedge; and where the average rod density is made greater on

the outside of the bends by the use of wedges of a more dense material[49].

Reverse Emittance Exchange. At the end of a sequence of a cooling elements,

the transverse emittance may not be as low as required, while the longitudinal emit-

tance, has been cooled to a value less than is required. The additional reduction of

transverse emittance can then be obtained by a reverse exchange of transverse and

longitudinal phase-spaces. This can be done in one of several ways:

1. by the use of wedged absorbers in dispersive regions between solenoid elements.

2. by the use of septa that subdivide the transverse beam size, acceleration that

shifts the energies of the parts, and bending to recombine the parts[49].

3. by the use of lithium lenses at very low energy: at very low energies the β⊥’s,
and thus equilibrium emittances, can be made arbitrarily low; but the energy

spread is blown up by the steep rise in dE/dx. If this blow up of dE/dx is left

uncorrected, then the eﬀect can be close to an emittance exchange.

1.3.7 Model Cooling System

We require a reduction of the normalized transverse emittance by almost three or-
10−5 m-rad), and a reduction of the longitudinal

emittance by one order of magnitude.

×

A model example has been generated that uses no recirculating loops, and it is
assumed for simplicity that the beams of each charge are cooled in separate channels

(it may be possible to design a system with both charges in the same channel). The

cooling is obtained in a series of cooling stages. In the early stages, they each have two

components:

1. FOFO lattice consisting of spaced axial solenoids with alternating ﬁeld directions

and lithium hydride absorbers placed at the centers of the spaces between them
where the β⊥’s are minimum. RF cavities are introduced between the absorbers
along the entire length of the lattice.

46

2. A lattice consisting of more widely separated alternating solenoids, and bending

magnets between them to generate dispersion. At the location of maximum dis-

persion, wedges of lithium hydride are introduced to interchange longitudinal and

transverse emittance.

In the last stages, reverse emittance exchange is achieved using current carrying

lithium rods. The energy is allowed to fall to 15 MeV, thus increasing the focussing
strength and lowering β⊥.

The design is based on analytic calculations. The phase advance in each cell of
the FOFO lattice is made as close to π as possible in order to minimize the β⊥’s at the
location of the absorber. The following eﬀects are included: space charge transverse

defocusing and longitudinal space charge forces; a 3 σ ﬂuctuation of momentum and

3 σ ﬂuctuations in amplitude.

The emittances, transverse and longitudinal, as a function of stage number, are

shown in Fig.27, together with the beam energy. In the ﬁrst 15 stages, relatively strong

wedges are used to rapidly reduce the longitudinal emittance, while the transverse

emittance is reduced relatively slowly. The objective is to reduce the bunch length,

thus allowing the use of higher frequency and higher gradient rf in the reacceleration

linacs.

In the next 10 stages, the emittances are reduced close to their asymptotic

limits. In the ﬁnal three stages, lithium rods are used to produce an eﬀective emittance

exchange, as described above.

Individual components of the lattices have been deﬁned, but a complete lattice

has not yet been speciﬁed, and no complete Monte Carlo study of its performance has

yet been performed. Wake ﬁelds, resistive wall eﬀects, second order rf eﬀects and some

higher order focus eﬀects are not yet included in this design of the system.

The total length of the system is 750 m, and the total acceleration used is 4.7

GeV. The fraction of muons that have not decayed and are available for acceleration is

sections by forming groups of stages into recirculating loops.

calculated to be 55 %.

1.3.8 Acceleration

Following cooling and initial bunch compression the beams must be rapidly accel-

erated to full energy (2 TeV, or 250 GeV). A sequence of linacs would work, but would

be expensive. Conventional synchrotrons cannot be used because the muons would de-

cay before reaching the required energy. The conservative solution is to use a sequence

of recirculating accelerators (similar to that used at CEBAF). A more economical so-

lution would be to use fast rise time pulsed magnets in synchrotrons, or synchrotrons

with rapidly rotating permanent magnets interspersed with high ﬁeld ﬁxed magnets.

Recirculating Acceleration. Tb. 6 gives an example of a possible sequence of

recirculating accelerators. After initial linacs, there are two conventional rf recirculating

accelerators taking the muons up to 75 GeV, then two superconducting recirculators

going up to 2000 GeV.

Criteria that must be considered in picking the parameters of such accelerators

The wavelengths of rf should be chosen to limit the loading, η, (it is restricted

to below 4 % in this example) to avoid excessive longitudinal wakeﬁelds and the

resultant emittance growth.

The wavelength should also be suﬃciently large compared to the bunch length to

avoid excessive second order eﬀects (in this example: 10 times).

For power eﬃciency, the cavity ﬁll time should be long compared to the acceler-

ation time. When conventional cavities cannot satisfy this condition, supercon-

ducting cavities are speciﬁed.

In order to minimize muon decay during acceleration (in this example 73% of

the muons are accelerated without decay), the number of recirculations at each

stage should be kept low, and the rf acceleration voltage correspondingly high.

For minimum cost, the number of recirculations appears to be of the order of 18.

In order to avoid a large number of separate magnets, multiple aperture magnets

can be designed (see Fig.28).

Note that the linacs see two bunches of opposite signs, passing through in opposite

A recent study[50] tracked particles through a similar sequence of recirculating

Pulsed Magnet Acceleration. An alternative to recirculating accelerators for

stages #2 and #3 would be to use pulsed magnet synchrotrons with rf systems con-

sisting of signiﬁcant lengths of superconducting linac.

The cross section of a pulsed magnet for this purpose is shown in Fig. 29.

desired, the number of recirculations could be higher in this case, and the needed rf

voltage correspondingly lower, but the loss of particles from decay would be somewhat

more. The cost for a pulsed magnet system appears to be signiﬁcantly less than that

of a multi-hole recirculating magnet system, and the power consumption is moderate

for energies up to 250 GeV. Unfortunately, the power consumption is impractical at

energies above 500 GeV.

Pulsed and Superconducting Hybrid. For the ﬁnal acceleration to 2 TeV in

the high energy machine, the power consumed by a ring using only pulsed magnets

would be excessive, but a hybrid ring with alternating pulsed warm magnets and ﬁxed

superconducting magnets[51][52] should be a good alternative.

Tb. 7 gives an example of a possible sequence of such accelerators. Fig. 16 used

a layout of this sequence. The ﬁrst two rings use pulsed cosine theta magnets with

peak ﬁelds of 3 T and 4 T. Then follow two hybrid magnet rings with 8 T ﬁxed magnets

alternating with

2 T iron yoke pulsed magnets. The latter two rings share the same

tunnel, and might share the same linac too. The survival from decay after all four rings

is 67 %. Phase space dilution should be similar to that determined for the recirculating

accelerator design above.

1.3.9 Collider Storage Ring

After acceleration, the µ+ and µ− bunches are injected into a storage ring that is
separate from the accelerator. The highest possible average bending ﬁeld is desirable,

to maximize the number of revolutions before decay, and thus maximize the luminosity.

Collisions would occur in one, or perhaps two, very low-β∗ interaction areas. Parameters
of the ring were given earlier in Tb.2.

the ring dipoles, radiating a fraction of their energy as synchrotron radiation towards

the outside of the ring, and depositing the rest on the inside. The total beam power,

in the 4 TeV machine, is 38 MW. The total power deposited in the ring is 13 MW, yet

the maximum power that can reasonably be taken from the magnet coils at 4 K is only

of the order of 40 KW. Shielding is required.

The beam is surrounded by a thick warm shield, located inside a large aperture

magnet. Fig.30 shows the attenuation of the heating produced as a function of the

thickness of a warm tungsten liner[53]. If conventional superconductor is used, then

the thicknesses required in the two cases would be as given in Tb.8. If high Tc super-

conductors could be used, then these thicknesses could probably be halved.

Figure 30. Energy attenuation vs. the thickness of a tungsten liner.

The magnet could be a conventional cosine-theta magnet (see Fig.31), or, in order

to reduce the compressive forces on the coil midplane, a rectangular block design.

The power deposited could be further reduced if the beams are kicked out of the

ring prior to their their complete decay. Since the luminosity goes as the square of the

Quadrupoles. The quadrupoles could have warm iron poles placed as close to

the beam as practical. The coils could be either superconducting or warm, as dictated

by cost considerations. If an elliptical vacuum chamber were used, and the poles were

at 1 cm radius, then gradients of 150 T/m should be possible.

Lattice Design.

1. Arcs: In a conventional 2 TeV FODO lattice the tune would be of the order of
10−3. In this case, in order to
maintain a bunch with rms length 3 mm, 45 GeV of S-band rf would be required.

×

This would be excessive. It is thus proposed to use an approximately isochronous

lattice of the dispersion wave type[54]. Ideally one would like an α of the order of
10−7. In this case the machine would behave more like a linear beam transport
and rf would be needed only to correct energy spread introduced by wake eﬀects.

It appears easy to set the zero’th order slip factor η0 to zero, but if nothing is
done, there is a relatively large ﬁrst order slip factor η1 yielding a minimum α of
the order of 10−5. The use of sextupoles appears able to correct this η1 yielding
a minimum α of the order of 10−6. With octupoles it may be possible to correct
η2, but this remains to be seen. But even with an α of the order of 10−6 very
little rf is needed.

It had been feared that amplitude dependent anisochronisity generated in the

insertion would cause bunch growth in an otherwise purely isochronous design.

It has, however, been pointed out[55] that if chromaticity is corrected in the ring,

then amplitude dependent anisochronisity is automatically removed.

2. Low β Insertion: In order to obtain the desired luminosity we require a very low
beta at the intersection point: β∗ = 3 mm for 4 TeV, β∗ = 8 mm for the .5 TeV
design. An initial ﬁnal focusing quadruplet design used 6.4 T maximum ﬁelds at

4 σ. This would allow a radiation shield of the order of 5 cm, while keeping the
peak ﬁelds at the conductors less than 10 T, which should be possible using Nb3Sn
conductor. The maximum beta’s in both x and y were of the order of 400 km in the

4 TeV case, and 14 km in the 0.5 TeV machine. The chromaticities (1/4π

βdk)

are approximately 6000 for the 4 TeV case, and 600 for the .5 TeV machine. A

R

later design[56] has lowered these chromaticities somewhat, but in either case the

chromaticities are too large to correct within the rest of a conventional ring and

therefore require local correction[57][58].

It is clear that there is a great advantage in using very powerful ﬁnal focus

quadrupoles. The use of niobium tin or even more exotic materials should be

pursued.

3. Model Designs: Initially, two lattices were generated[59][60],[61], one of which[61],

with the application of octupole and decapole correctors, had an adequate cal-

culated dynamic aperture. More recently, a new lattice and IR section has been

generated[56] with much more desirable properties than those in the previously

reported versions. Stronger ﬁnal focusing quadrupoles were employed to reduce

the maximum β’s and chromaticity, the dispersion was increased in the chromatic

54

correction regions, and the sextupole strengths reduced. It was also discovered

that, by adding dipoles near the intersection point, the background in the detector

could be reduced.[56]

the collider behave like that in a linear beam transport[63][64].

In this case, beam

breakup instabilities are the most important collective eﬀects. Even with an aluminum

beam pipe of radius b = 2.5 cm, the resistive wall eﬀect will cause the tail amplitude

of the bunch to double in about 500 turns. For a broad-band impedance of Q = 1
and Zk/n = 1 Ohm, the doubling time in the same beam pipe is only about 130 turns;
which is clearly unacceptable. But both these instabilities can easily be stabilized using

BNS[65] damping. For instance, to stabilize the resistive wall instability, the required

tune spread, calculated[63] using the two particle model approximation, is (for Al pipe)

This application of the BNS damping to a quasi-isochronous ring, where there
are other head-tail instabilities due to the chromaticities ξ and η1, needs more careful
study.

If it is not possible to obtain an α less than 10−7, then rf must be introduced and
synchrotron oscillations will occur. The above instabilities are then somewhat stabilized

because of the interchanging of head and tail, but the impedance of the rf now adds to

the problem and simple BNS damping is no longer possible.

Three diﬀerent impedance models: resonator, resistive wall, and a SLAC-like or a

microwave instability is well beyond threshold. Two approaches are being considered

to control these instabilities: 1) BNS damping applied by rf quadrupoles as suggested

by Chao[66]; and 2) applying an oscillating perturbation on the chromaticity[67].

1.4 BACKGROUND AND DETECTOR

1.4.1 Design of the Intersection Region

The design of the Intersection Region[68] is driven by the desire to reduce the back-

ground from muon decays in the detector as much as possible. For this study a 130 m

ﬁnal focus section (Fig. 32) which included four ﬁnal quadrupoles, three toroids, a 2 T

solenoidal ﬁeld for the detector and the connecting beam pipe and shielding was mod-

eled in GEANT with all the appropriate magnetic ﬁelds and shielding materials. The

parameters used were taken from [59][60]. Trajectories of particles with and without

decay are shown later in Figs.33 and 34. Studies of the eﬀects of high energy elec-

trons hitting speciﬁc edges and surfaces were carried out and the shielding adjusted or

augmented to mitigate the apparent eﬀects of particular background problems. Eﬀects

due to electrons, photons, neutrons and charged hadrons and muons were considered in

turn to try to optimized the design. While the current design is not fully optimized, it

is a marked improvement over a much simpler design which had been used in the past.

More importantly, it helped develop the tools and strategy to do such an optimization

as the lattice is further developed. A second study[69] using a somewhat diﬀerent ﬁnal

focus design and selecting shielding parameters has given results that are of the same

order of magnitude as those that will be discussed in detail here.

The ﬁnal focus may be thought to be composed of 3 separate regions. The longest

of these, from 130 m to approximately 6.5 m contains the quadrupole magnets which

bring the beam to the ﬁnal focus in the intersection region. The space available between

the four quadrupoles was used to install toroids. They fulﬁll a double role: ﬁrst they

are used as scrapers for the electromagnetic debris; secondly, they serve as magnetic

deﬂectors for the Bethe–Heitler(BH) muons generated upstream. The eﬀect of the

toroids on the BH muons will be discussed later. In order to optimize the inner aperture
of the toroids, the σx and σy envelope of the muon bunch at every exit of the quadrupoles
has been estimated. The inner aperture of each toroid was chosen to match the 4 σ

ellipse of the muon bunch at that point. The second region, from 6.5 m to 1.1 m

contains tungsten plus additional shielding boxes to help contain neutrons produced

by photons in the electromagnetic showers. A shielding box consists of a block of Cu

surrounded by polyboron. The shielding here is designed with inverted cones to reduce

the probability of electrons hitting the edges of collimators or glancing oﬀ shielding

surfaces (Fig. 35). The beam aperture at the entrance to this section is reduced to 2.5

cm and by the exit of the section to 4.5 mm. This proﬁle follows the beam envelope as

the particles approach the intersection region. The intersection region itself (Fig. 36) is

designed as an inverse cone to prevent electrons which reach this region from hitting any
shielding as this region is directly viewed by the detector. A 20◦ tungsten cone around
the intersection region is required for the reduction of the electromagnetic component

of the background. The cone is lined, except very near the intersection region with

polyboron to reduce the slow neutron ﬂux.

In the shielding calculations it is also

assumed that there is a polyboron layer before the calorimeter and surrounding the
muon system. In earlier designs this cone was only 9◦. Whether or not the full 20◦ is
required is still under study and work is ongoing to evaluate the physics impact of this

choice of the shielding cone angle. It is likely that, after optimization is completed, the

cone angle will be reduced.

1.4.2 Detector Speciﬁcations and Design

The physics requirements of a muon collider detector are similar to those of an

electron collider. The main diﬀerence has to do with the machine related backgrounds

and the added shielding that is needed near the beam pipe.

At this time little detailed work has been done on the design of a complete detector.

Most of the discussion has centered around the types of detector elements which might

function well in this environment. The background levels detailed in the previous sec-

tion are much higher than the comparable levels calculated for the SSC detectors and

appear to be somewhat in excess of the levels expected at the LHC. Clearly segmen-

tation is the key to successfully dealing with this environment. One major advantage

of this muon collider over high energy hadron colliders is the long time between beam

crossings; the LHC will have crossings every 25 ns compared to the 10 µs expected for

the 4 TeV µ-collider. Much of the detector discussion has focused on ways to exploit

this time between crossings to increase the segmentation while holding the number of

readout elements to manageable levels.

The real impact of the backgrounds will be felt in the inner tracking and vertex

systems. One attractive possibility for a tracking system is a Time Projection Chamber

(TPC)[70]. This is an example of a low density, high precision device which takes

advantage of the long time between crossings to provide low background and high

segmentation with credible readout capability.

Silicon, if it can withstand damage from the neutron ﬂuxes, appears to be an

adequate option for vertex detection. Again, because of the time between beam cross-

ings, an attractive option is the Silicon Drift Detector[71]. Short drift TPC’s with

microstrip[72] readout could also be considered for vertex detection.

An interesting question which has yet to be addressed is whether or not it is

possible to tag high energy muons which penetrate the tungsten shielding which, in
the present design, extends to 20◦ from the beam axis. For example, in the case of

The detector performance criteria that are used for the design of the detector are

summarized in Tb. 12. The object of this present exercise is to see if a detector can be

built using state-of-the-art (or not far beyond) technology to satisfy the physics needs

background.

The main features of the detector are:The element nearest to the intersection region

is the vertex detector located at as small a radius as possible. A number of technologies

including Silicon Drift Detectors(SDD), Silicon Pixels[73], and CCD detectors have been

considered, as well as short drift TPC’s. SDD seem especially attractive because of the

reduced number of readout channels and potentially easier construction. A micro TPC

would have lower occupancy and greater radiation resistance. Tracking technologies

considered were cathode pad chambers, silicon strips and TPCs. The use of a TPC

is interesting as the amount of material is minimized and thus the detector does not

suﬀer as much from low energy photon and neutron backgrounds.

For the calorimeter system there are many options. A liquid argon accordion

calorimeter for the EM part[73],[74] and a scintillator hadronic calorimeter appear
appropriate. This combination gives a hadronic resolution that is of order 50%/√E
which may be good enough. The high granularity of the EM section allows good electron

Figure 37. Strawman Detector

identiﬁcation which will be of help in tagging b-jets. In addition the longitudinal and

transverse granularity allow for corrections on an event by event basis to compensate for

the fact that the calorimeter is non-compensating as well as to allow the identiﬁcation

of catastrophic muon bremsstrahlung.

There is a single solenoid magnet, with a ﬁeld of 2 T in the tracking region. The

magnet is located behind the hadron calorimeter.

The muon system is a stand-alone system. The chambers in the muon system are

Cathode Strip Chambers(CSC) that can be used for both a two dimensional readout

as well as a trigger. These chambers have good timing resolution and relatively short

drift time which minimizes neutron background problems. We now consider these

components in detail:

1.4.4 Silicon Drift Vertex Detector

The best silicon detectors are capable of achieving a position resolution of 4 µm

with a detector 300 µm thick. However, these results were obtained only with normally

62

incident charged particles. For other angles of incidence, the resolution can be degraded

by the ﬂuctuations in the density of the ionization (Landau) in the silicon. The presence

of a magnetic ﬁeld modiﬁes the trajectories of electrons in a silicon drift detector and

normal incidence is no longer the ideal one. There is, however, a proper incidence angle

which does not give any degradation of the position resolution.

The granularity of the proposed detector seems be reasonable for the rates of

background particles. Based on rates in Tbs. 9,10,11, a layer located 10 cm from the
beam would have 22 hits per cm2 from the interaction of neutral particles and 32 from
316 µm2 the number of pixel
crossings of charged particles. For a pixel size of 316
per cm2 is 1000. In this case the occupancy of background hits is less than 6%.

×

The damage due to the radiation dose may be a serious problem. Only about

1/3 of the neutrons have energies above 100 KeV and contribute to this damage, but
the integrated ﬂux per year for this example would still be 3 1014 n′s cm−2year−1. If
1012/cm3
detectors are produced from an n–type silicon with a bulk doping level of 1.5
the detectors would have to be replaced after a year of operation. The use of p–

×

type material seems to be more appropriate for this application. P–type silicon drift

detectors are being developed in LBNL. These detectors are supposed to be much more

radiation resistant. Some R&D may be required.

1.4.5 Time Projection Chamber (TPC)

An interesting candidate for tracking at a muon collider is a Time Projection

Chamber (TPC). This device has good track reconstruction capabilities in a low density

environment, good 3-dimensional imaging and provides excellent momentum resolution

and track pointing to the vertex region. It is perhaps particularly well suited to this

environment as the long time between bunch crossings (

1
∼
m and the average density of the device is low compared to more conventional trackers

10 µs) permits drifts of

∼

which helps to reduce the measured background rates in the device.

In the present

detector considerations the TPC would occupy the region between the conic tungsten

absorber and electromagnetic calorimeter in the region from 35 cm to 120 cm, divided

into two parts, each 1 m long.

To reduce background gamma and neutron interactions in the detector volume,

a low density gas mixture should be chosen as the detection medium of the TPC.

Another important parameter is the electron drift velocity. Since the time between

beam crossings is ﬁxed (10 µs in the present design) the drift velocity should be high

enough to collect all the ionization deposited in the drift region. Finally the detection

medium should not contain low atomic number gases to help reduce the transfer energy

to the recoil nucleus and in this way to reduce its range in the gas. The gas mixture 90%
He + 10% CF4 satisﬁes all these requirements and could be an excellent candidate. It

a density 1.2 mg/cm3 and a drift velocity of 9.4 cm/µs. The single electron longitudinal
diﬀusion for this gas is

Occupancy from Photons. Low energy photons, neutrons and charged particles

produce the main backgrounds in the tracker. Photons in the MeV region interact with

matter mainly by Compton scattering. For a 1 MeV photon the probability of producing

length of the Compton electron tracks in the TPC is 0.5 meter and therefore, the

and could be further reduced by subdividing the chamber in length, thus shortening

the drift distances. Indeed this may be required to reduce an excessive space charge

distortion from the accumulation of ions.

These Compton tracks can easily be identiﬁed and removed. Because almost all

points of a Compton track lie along the z-axis most of them will be projected into

one cell and therefore the number of points in this cell will be very diﬀerent from hit

cells from non-background tracks. To remove low momentum electron tracks, all cells

64

containing more than some threshold number of points should be excluded. Applying

this procedure a few percent of volume is lost but the quality of the high momentum

tracks is not substantially changed. This is illustrated in Fig. 38 where one sector of

the TPC is shown after the application of diﬀerent value threshold cuts.

It is easy to clean out these recoil tracks owing to their large ionization density

per cell. Only a simple cut to remove all volume cells which contain a charge in excess

of some preset threshold is required. This cut will only eliminate about 1% of the TPC

volume.

1.4.6 Micro TPC for vertex detection

TPCs with very short drift distances (3 cm) and microstrip readout (0.2 x 2 mm

pads) might be an interesting alternative to silicon drift chambers for vertex detection.

The resolution of such chambers would be somewhat worse (of the order of 30 µm,

compared with 4 µm), but the greater number of points would compensate for this to

some extent. Such chambers would have less occupancy and much greater radiation

resistance than silicon devices.

1.4.7 Electromagnetic Calorimeter

An accordion liquid argon calorimeter is being developed for the ATLAS collaboration[73].

A similar calorimeter designed for the GEM Collaboration at the SSC.

From the GEANT background calculations, the total energy deposited from the

electromagnetic debris is

13 TeV but relatively uniformly distributed. If one divides
105 cells, the mean energy would be about 65 MeV/cell.

Certainly, energetic electromagnetic showers from γ’s or electrons or the core of jets

will stand out above this uniform noise. Since the readout is every 10 µs, multiplexing

is possible to reduce costs compared to the LHC where collisions occur every 25 ns.

1.4.8 Hadron Calorimeter

A good choice for the hadron calorimeter is a scintillator tile device being designed

for ATLAS[73]. It uses a novel approach where the tiles are arranged perpendicular to

the beam direction to allow easy coupling to wave-length shifting ﬁbers[75]. With a

tile calorimeter of the type discussed here it should be possible to achieve a resolution

of ∆ E/E

50%/√E, satisfying the requirements in Tb. 12.

∼

From the GEANT background calculations, the total energy deposited in the

calorimeter from electromagnetic and hadronic showers and muons is about 200 TeV.
Again, this is rather uniform with and if subdivided into 105 towers would introduce
2 GeV pedestals with 300 MeV ﬂuctuations: also acceptable. But the muons, aris-

ing from Bethe-Heitler pair production in EM showers or from a halo in the machine,

66

though modest in number, have high average energies. They would not be a prob-

lem in the tracking detectors, but in the calorimeters, they would occasionally induce

deeply inelastic interactions, depositing clumps of energy deep in the absorbers.

If

a calorimeter is not able to recognize the direction of such interactions (they will be

pointing along the beam axis) then they would produce unacceptable ﬂuctuations in

hadron energy determination. Segmenting the calorimetry in depth should allow these

interactions to be subtracted. We are studying various solutions, including the use of

fast time digitizing[76] to provide such segmentation, but ultimately there will have to

be some hardware tests to verify the MC study.

1.4.9 Muon Spectrometer

Triggering is probably the most diﬃcult aspect of muon spectrometers in large, 4π

detectors in both lepton and hadron colliders. In addition, a muon system should be

able to cope with the larger than usual muon backgrounds that would be encountered

in a muon collider. Segmentation is, again, the key to handling these high background

rates. Cathode Strip Chambers (CSC) are an example of a detector that could be used

in the muon system of a muon collider experiment. This detector performs all functions

1.4.10 Halo Background

In addition, the cathodes can be lithographically segmented almost arbitrarily resulting

in pixel detectors the size of which is limited only by the density and signal routing of

There could be a very serious background from the presence of even a very small

halo of near full energy muons in the circulating beam. The beam will need careful

preparation before injection into the collider, and a collimation system will have to be

designed to be located on the opposite side of the ring from the detector.

1.4.11 Pair Production

There is also a background from incoherent (i.e. µ+µ−

e+e−) pair production
in the 4 TeV Collider case[77]. The cross section is estimated to be 10 mb[78], which

would give rise to a background of

104 electron pairs per bunch crossing. The
electrons at production, do not have signiﬁcant transverse momentum, but the ﬁelds of

×

≈

the oncoming 3 µm bunch can deﬂect them towards the detector. A simple program was

written to track electrons from close to the axis (the worst case) as they are deﬂected

away from the bunch center. Once clear of the opposing bunch, the tracks spiral under

the inﬂuence of the experimental solenoid ﬁeld. Fig. 39 (a) shows the radii vs, length

of these electron tracks for initial momenta from 3.8 to 3000 MeV in geometric steps
of √2 and a solenoid ﬁeld of 2 T, see Fig.39a ( Fig. 39b it is 4 T). In the 2 T case,
tracks with initial energy below 30 MeV do not make it out to a detector at 10 cm,

while those above 100 MeV have too small an initial angle and remain within the shield.

Approximately 10 %(3000) of these are in this energy range and pass through a detector

68

at 10 cm. The track ﬂuence at the ends of the detector are less than 10 tracks per cm2
which should not present a serious problem. At 5 cm, there are 4500 tracks giving a
ﬂuence of 30 per cm2, which is also probably acceptable. If the detector solenoid ﬁeld
is raised to 4 T then no electrons reach 10 cm and the ﬂux at 5 cm is reduced by a

factor of 2.

There remains some question about the coherent pair production generated by vir-

tual photons interacting with the coherent electromagnetic ﬁelds of the entire oncoming

bunch. A simple Weizs¨acker-Williams calculation[77] yields a background that would

consume the entire beam at a rate comparable with its decay. However, I. Ginzburg[78]

and others have argued that the integration must be cut oﬀ due to the ﬁnite size of

the ﬁnal electrons. If this is true, then the background becomes negligible. A more

detailed study of this problem is now underway[79][80].

If the coherent pair production problem is conﬁrmed, then there are two possible

electromagnetic ﬁelds at the intersection are canceled and the pair production becomes

negligible.

2) plasma could be introduced at the intersection point to cancel the beam elec-

tromagnetic ﬁelds[81].

1.4.12 Detector and Background Conclusions.

Two independent background calculations have been used for a preliminary study

of the expected background level at a 4 TeV muon collider. The optimization of the

intersection region is still at its infancy, but the results of both studies show that

the level of background while still large, can be managed with proper design of the

intersection region and choice of detector technologies. This is in large part due to the

fact that the background is composed of many very soft particles which behave like a

pedestal shift in the calorimeter. The tracking and vertexing systems will have to be

highly segmented to handle this ﬂux of background particles.

A large amount of work is still needed in order to optimize the intersection region

and the ﬁnal focus. In particular a better understanding of the trade oﬀ between the

diﬀerent backgrounds is required. The strawman detector is meant only to show that

the muon collider detector has unique problems and advantages. An optimized detector

needs to be developed taking these problems into consideration.

Some preliminary calculations for machine related backgrounds for a lower en-

ergy collider (250 GeV x 250 GeV) have also been carried out. It appears that the

backgrounds in this case are comparable to those at the 4 TeV machine. Since little

69

attention has yet been paid to the details of the ﬁnal focus for this lower energy machine

it is possible that reductions in the machine related backgrounds will be achievable in

the future.

1.5.2 Polarization

Up to this point, this report has concentrated on the design of a muon collider

1) beam energies of 2 + 2 TeV

2) operating at its maximum energy

3) with a ﬁxed rms energy spread of 0.12

4) with no attention to maximizing polarization

In this section we discuss modiﬁcations to enhance the muon polarization’s, oper-

ating parameters with very small momentum spreads, operations at energies other than

the maximum for which a machine is designed, and designs of machines for diﬀerent

Polarized Muon Production. The speciﬁcations and components in the base-

line design have not been optimized for polarization. Nevertheless, simple manipu-

lations of parameters and the addition of momentum selection after phase rotation

does generate signiﬁcant polarization with relatively modest loss of luminosity. The

only other signiﬁcant changes required to give polarization at the interaction point are

rotators in the transfer lines, and a chicane snake in the collider opposite the IP.

In the center of mass of a decaying pion, the outgoing muon is fully polarized (-1
for µ+ and +1 for µ−). In the lab system the polarization depends[82] on the decay
angle θd and initial pion energy. Figure 40 shows this polarization as a function of
the cosine of the center of mass decay angle, for a number of pion energies. It is seen

that for pion kinetic energy larger than the pion mass, the dependence on pion energy

becomes negligible and the polarization is given approximately by:

Pµ−

cos θd + 0.28(1

cos2 θd)

≈

−

(19)

The average value of this is about 0.19. A Monte Carlo calculation[83] of the capture,

decay and phase rotation discussed above gave muon polarization of approximately

0.22. The slight diﬀerence of this value from the average comes from an accidental bias

If higher polarization is required, some deliberate selection of muons from forward

narrow energy range and then selecting only those muons with energy close to that

of the selected pions. But such a procedure would collect a very small fraction of all

possible muons and would yield a very small luminosity. Instead we wish, as in the

unpolarized case, to capture pions over a wide energy range, allow them to decay, and

to use rf to phase rotate the resulting distribution.

Consider the distributions in velocity vs. ct at the end of a decay channel. If the

source bunch of protons is very short and if the pions were generated in the forward

direction, then the pions, if they did not decay, would all be found on a single curved

line. Muons from forward decays would have gained velocity and would lie above that

line. Muons from backward decays would have lost velocity and would fall below the

line. A real distribution will be diluted by the length of the proton bunch, and by

diﬀerences in forward velocity due to the ﬁnite angles of particles propagating in the

solenoid ﬁelds. In order to reduce the latter, it is found desirable to lower the solenoid

ﬁeld in the decay channel from 5 to 3 Tesla. When this is done, and in the absence of

phase rotation, one obtains the distribution shown in Fig. 41, where the polarization

It is found that phase rotation does not remove this correlation: see Fig. 42. Now,

after time cuts to eliminate decays from high and low energy pions, there is a simple

correlation of polarization with the energy of the muons. If a selection is made on the

minimum energy of the muons, then net polarization is obtained. The higher the cut
on energy, the greater the polarization, but the less the fraction Floss of muons that are
selected. The cut in time can probably be obtained from the phasing of the rf used to

capture the bunch. Alternatively, it could be provided by a second energy cut applied

after a 90 degree longitudinal phase rotation.

In order to provide the required cut on energy, one needs to generate dispersion

that is signiﬁcantly larger than the beam size. Collimation from one side can then

select the higher energy muons. After collimation, the remaining dispersion should

be removed. The generation of suﬃcient dispersion, in the presence of the very large

emittance, is non-trivial. The only practical method appears to be the use of a bent

solenoid (as discussed above, in the section of Muon Collider Components). First the

solenoid is bent one way to generate the dispersion; the collimator is introduced; then

the solenoid is bend the other way to remove the dispersion. The complete system thus
looks like an “S” or “snake”. Particles with momentum pµ in a magnetic ﬁeld B have
a bending radius of RB, given by:

If the particles are trapped in a solenoid with this ﬁeld, and the solenoid is bent with

Fig. 44 and Tb. 13 give the results of a Monte Carlo study[83] in which dispersion

is introduced, and progressive cuts are applied, to the muons at the end of the phase

rotation. In this calculation, in order to calculate more rapidly, the trajectories were

not actually traced through a snake. Instead, the particles were propagated through

20 m of straight solenoid, followed by the application of dispersion equal to 6 times

the momentum in GeV/c. A snake that would give such dispersion could have the
parameters: solenoid ﬁeld of 3 T (giving RB = 0.25 m at the average momentum of
230 MeV/c), diameter of snake bends greater than 5 m and bend angles of 320◦, (which
would require some variations in bend curvature to avoid the solenoid crossing itself),

Tb. 13 gives results for two ﬁelds in the decay channel solenoids: 5 T, the ﬁeld in

the point design; and 3 Tesla, chosen to increase the polarization. It is seen that for

weak cuts and small polarization, it is better to avoid the loss of muons from the lower,

3 T, ﬁeld, but with stronger cuts, the lower ﬁeld gives greater polarization. In Fig. 44,

and subsequent plots, only data from the preferred ﬁelds are shown beyond the cross

It is seen from Tb. 13 that the energy cut not only increases the polarization, but

also decreases the energy spread ∆E of the remaining muons. In Fig. 45 the fractional
energy spread ∆E/E is plotted against the loss factor Floss. The energy spread is
reduced almost a factor of two for reasonable collimator positions. This reduction in

energy spread would eliminate the need for the ﬁrst stage of emittance cooling.

A Monte Carlo study has also been done on the eﬀect of variations of the proton
bunch length σt. Fig. 46a shows the polarization before cooling as a function of σt for
three values of the loss factor Floss. It is seen that serious loss of polarization can occurs
when the rms width is more than 1 nsec. Fig. 46b shows the muon rms energy spread

over.

after the polarization cut. Again it is shown as a function of σt for three values of the
loss factor Floss. With no cut, the rise in energy spread would be serious (∆E > 20 MeV
is diﬃcult to cool) for an rms width more than 1 ns. But with polarization cuts, the

energy spread is so reduced that a larger proton bunch length would not be a problem.

1.5.3 Polarization Preservation

A recent paper[84] has discussed the preservation of muon polarization in some

detail. During the ionization cooling process the muons lose energy in material and

have a spin ﬂip probability

, where

where βv is the muon velocity divided by c, and ∆E/E is the fractional loss of energy
due to ionization. In our case the integrated energy loss is approximately 3 GeV and

the typical energy is 150 MeV, so the integrated spin ﬂip probability is close to 10%.

(23)

Figure 46. Polarization vs σt, the proton bunch length (upper plot). Muon rms energy spread vs.
σt (lower plot). Both plots for three values of the loss factor Floss.

The change in polarization dP/P is twice the spin ﬂip probability, so the reduction in
polarization is approximately 20 %. This dilution is included in the “Pf inal” column in
Tb. 13 and is plotted as the line in Fig. 44.

During circulation in any ring, the muon spins, if initially longitudinal, will precess
10−3. An
energy spread dγ/γ will introduce variations in these precessions and cause dilution of

the polarization. But if the particles remain in the ring for an exact integer number

of synchrotron oscillations, then their individual average γ’s will be the same and no

dilution will occur. It appears reasonable to use this “synchrotron spin matching”[84]

to avoid dilution during acceleration.

In the collider, however, the synchrotron frequency will be too slow to use “syn-

chrotron spin matching”, so one of two methods must be used.

•

Bending can be performed with the spin orientation in the vertical direction, and

the spin rotated into the longitudinal direction only for the interaction region.

The design of such spin rotators appears relatively straightforward. The example

77

given in the above reference would only add 120 m of additional arc length, but

no design has yet been incorporated into the lattice.

•

The alternative is to install a Siberian Snake[85] at a location exactly opposite to

the intersection point. Such a snake reverses the sign of the horizontal polarization

and generates a cancelation of the precession in the two halves of the ring.

Provision must also be made to allow changes in the relative spins of the two

opposing bunches. This could be done, prior to acceleration, by switching one of the

two beams into one or the other of two alternative injection lines.

1.5.4 Beneﬁts of Polarization of Both Beams

We consider two examples of the general advantage of having polarization in both

beams. Individual physics experiments would have to be considered to determine how

important such advantages are.

the two muons.

Consider the polarization of a vector spin state generated by the annihilation of

When only one beam has polarization P1, then Pvec = P1. But if both beams have
polarization P in the same direction (ie. with opposite helicities), then

−

In Fig. 47 both the polarization of each beam P , and the resulting polarization of a
vector state Pvector are plotted against the loss factor Floss.

A second advantage is that the ratio Rv/s of vector to scalar luminosity can be ma-
nipulated to enhance either the vector or the scalar state. If the polarization directions

have been chosen to enhance the ratio of vector to scalar states, then:

Tb. 13 and Fig. 48 show this ratio as a function of the loss factor Floss.

Tb. 13 also shows that the fraction of total luminosity in a given state can be

enhanced. If polarizations are chosen to enhance the vector state, then the fraction of

vector luminosity is increased from 1/2 to (1 + P )/2, giving a gain factor of

1.5.5 Luminosity loss

If nothing else is done, then the luminosity, which is proportional to nµ, will drop

loss; where Floss is the fraction muons lost by the muon momentum cut. At the
same time, however, the space charge, wakeﬁeld, and loading during the cooling and

acceleration will all be reduced; as will the beam beam tune shift in the collider. Clearly,

the machine parameters should be reoptimized and some part of the lost luminosity

recovered.

One way to recover the luminosity would be to increase the proton bunch intensity
by the factor Floss. If this were done, then the original number of muons per bunch
would be generated; all the wake ﬁeld, loading and space charge eﬀects would be the

same; and the luminosity per bunch crossing would be the same. If we assume that

the total proton current is determined by the driver, then such an increase in proton

intensity per bunch will necessitate a reduction in the number of bunches or repetition
rate, by the same factor Floss. The luminosity will then fall by Floss and not by F 2
as before.

loss

For instance, in the unpolarized case of the 4 TeV collider, there were two bunches
of each sign. If the momentum cut is chosen to give a value of Floss = 1/2, and the
proton beam is distributed into 2 instead of 4 initial bunches, then the ﬁnal number

of muons per bunch, the loading, beam beam tune shift, etc. would all be the same as

in the unpolarized case. The luminosity would be down by a factor of only two, for a

polarization of 34 % in both beams.

For higher polarization at good luminosity it would be desirable to have a proton

source with the option of a lower repetition rate, but even larger numbers of protons
per spill. For example 4 x 1014 protons per pulse at 4 Hz. It should then be possible to
extend this method to an operation with Floss = 1/8, and polarization of both beams
of 57 %.

One also notes that the luminosity could be maintained at the full unpolarized

value if the proton source intensity could be increased. Such an increase in proton

source intensity in the unpolarized case would be impractical because of the resultant

excessive high energy muon beam power, but this restriction does not apply if the

increase is used to oﬀset losses in generating polarization. If, for instance, the driver
repetition rate were increased from 15 to 30 Hz, the fractions Floss set at 0.5, and the
number of bunches reduced to one, then the full luminosity of 1035 (cm−2s−1) would
be maintained with polarization of both beams of 34%.

1.5.7 Luminosity vs. Energy, for a Given Ring

For a ﬁxed collider lattice, operating at energies lower than the design value, the
luminosity will fall as γ3. One power comes from the γ in Eq. 28; a second comes from
nef f , the eﬀective number of turns, that is proportional to γ; the third factor comes
from β∗, which must be increased proportional to γ in order to keep the beam size
constant within the focusing magnets. The bunch length σz must also be increased
proportional to γ so that the required longitudinal phase space is not decreased; so A
= σz/β∗ remains constant.

1.5.8 Scaling for Collider Rings for Diﬀerent Energies

As noted above, the luminosity in a given ring will fall as the third power of the

energy at which it is operated. Such a drop is more rapid than the gain in typical cross

sections, and, as we shall see, it is more rapid than the drop in luminosity obtained

with rings designed for the lower energies. It would thus be reasonable, having invested

in a muon source and accelerator, to build a sequence of collider rings at spacings of

factors of 2-3 in maximum energy. We will now derive scaling rules for such collider

rings.

If a ﬁnal focus multiplet is scaled keeping the relative component lengths and the

target to the ﬁrst quadrupole (proportional to all quadrupole lengths in the multiplet),
and amax is the maximum aperture of any quadrupole (proportional to all apertures in
the multiplet).

The normalized emittance ǫn is constrained by the ionization cooling, but since one
can exchange transverse and longitudinal emittance, it is, in principle, the six dimen-
sional emittance ǫ6 that is constrained. Extending the lepton emittance conventions,
we deﬁne:

1.5.9 Six Dimensional Emittance dependence on nµ and ǫn

The six dimensional emittance ǫ6 obtained from the cooling will, because of more
detailed constraints, depend to some extent on the number of muons nµ, and on the
ﬁnal transverse emittance ǫn.

The approximate dependence on the number of muons is relatively transparent.

As the number of muons per bunch rises, the longitudinal space charge forces increase

and it becomes impossible, without changing the rf gradients, to maintain the same

bunch lengths. As a result the bunch lengths must be increased by the square root of

the number of muons.

A study, with the analytic formulae used for the model cooling system discussed

before, was used again to derive cooling sequences with diﬀerent ﬁnal parameters.

First, sequences were calculated with numbers of initial muons per bunch of 1, 2, 3.75,
7.5, and 15 x 1012 (corresponding to muons in the collider of 0.1, 0.2, 1, 2, and 4 x
1012). The ﬁnal transverse emittance at the end of the cooling was required to be
10−5 m). The six
4
dimensional emittances obtained are plotted in Fig. 49a. It is seen that for nµ > 1012
the six dimensional emittances are indeed approximately proportional to the root of

10−5 m, (corresponding to an emittance in the collider of 5

the number of muons (the line shows this dependence).

The study also obtained cooling sequences giving six dimensional emittances for

a range of ﬁnal transverse emittances. The dependence here is more complicated. If

emittance exchange between longitudinal and transverse emittances could be achieved

without material then the six dimensional emittance should be independent of the ﬁnal

transverse emittance chosen. But the exchange does require material and Coulomb

scattering in this material increases the six dimensional emittances; and it does so to

a greater extent if the transverse emittance is small.

In Fig. 49b, we show the six

dimensional emittances obtained for 5 representative transverse emittances. Over the
range of interest the dependence of ǫ6 is approximately the inverse root of ǫn (the line
shows this dependence).

For the purposes of this study, we may thus assume that:

will at some point become unreasonable. If we impose a maximum number of muons

1.6 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PLAN

In this section we discuss a Research and Development plan aimed at the operation

of a 0.5 TeV demonstration machine by the year 2010, and of the 4 TeV machine by

year 2020. It assumes 5 years of theoretical study, component modeling and critical

subsystem demonstration; followed by 4 years of component development and demon-

stration machine design. Construction of the demonstration machine would follow and

take about 4 years. The high energy machine would come a decade later.

1.6.1 Theoretical Studies

Much progress has been made during the last year. New problems continue to be

uncovered, but new solutions have been found. Much work remains to be done: The

ﬁrst object will be to deﬁne a single self consistent set of parameters for the 4 TeV

collider. Items needing study include:

1. Deﬁne parameters for the proton source, target, capture and phase rotation sys-

tems.

2. Incorporate operating parameters for the optional operation with polarized, or

very low energy spread, beams.

3. Deﬁne and simulate a complete cooling scenario.

4. Deﬁne a preferred acceleration scenario and perform complete simulations. Study

the required shielding of the superconducting cavities from muon decay electrons.

5. Design a halo scraping system for the collider ring.

6. Continue work on the collider lattice, including a study of the eﬀect of lattice

errors, and an investigation of the use of higher order multipole correctors. Con-

tinue the study of the stability of the proposed beams and design an rf system

for BNS damping.

7. Continue optimization of the shielding of the detector.

8. Design a “strawman” detector with all components capable of withstanding the

backgrounds, and simulate some representative physics observations.

It is estimated (see Tb. 15) that the current eﬀort is about 22 full time equivalents,

but only a few of these are funded speciﬁcally for such work. Not only should the eﬀort

be legitimized, but, if we are to determine if such machines are practical, it needs to be

expanded. The machine is complex and unconventional. Many separate systems need

study. Some have hardly been looked at yet.

1.6.2 Component Development and Demonstrations

Theoretical studies alone will not be suﬃcient to determine the practicality of a

muon collider. Experimental studies are essential. Some such studies can be undertaken

without new funding, but the major eﬀorts will require speciﬁc support. We attempt

below to estimate what will be required.

Proton Driver Experimental R & D. Beam dynamic experiments at the BNL

AGS will be needed, but should not be expensive. A modiﬁcation of the AGS to

avoid transition in that machine, and study the resulting improvements in phase space

density would be very desirable, but the cost should probably be justiﬁed as an AGS

improvement, rather than as a muon collider experiment, and it has not been included

in this estimate.

Target, Capture and Decay Channel Experimental R & D. An experiment[28,

29] has taken data and is currently being analyzed, to determine pion production at

its low energy maximum. This data, together with assumptions on pion reabsorbtion

should allow more realistic Monte-Carlo calculations of total pion yield and capture in

a solenoid. Nevertheless, there are several reasons why a demonstration of such capture

is desirable:

87

•

•

•

•

Thermal cooling requirements dictate that the target be liquid: liquid lead and

gallium are under consideration. In order to avoid shock damage to a container,

the liquid may need to be in the form of a jet. Since the magnetic ﬁeld over

the target will eﬀect both the heat distribution in, and forces on, such a jet, an

experiment is required.

The simulation must make assumptions on the cross sections for secondary pion

production by products of the primary interaction. This information is needed

at low ﬁnal energies and large angles where data is inadequate. A conventional

experiment to determine all such cross sections would be expensive.

We need to know the total radiation directed towards the capture and focusing

solenoids. Shielding will have to be provided to protect the insulation of the inner

resistive solenoid, and limit heating of the outer superconducting magnets. Only

direct measurement of such radiation can provide a reliable determination.

In the current design of phase rotation, the ﬁrst rf cavity is placed 3 m from the

target. If unshielded, the radiation level at this point will be very high. We have

little data on the performance of a cavity under such conditions and thus have

diﬃculty calculating the shielding requirements.

Ionization Cooling Experimental R & D. Although the principals of ioniza-

tion cooling are relatively simple, there are practical problems in designing lattices that

can transport, and focus the large emittances without exciting betatron resonances that

blow up the emittance and attenuate the beam. There will also be problems with space

charge and wake ﬁeld eﬀects.

After a design has been deﬁned and simulated, demonstrations will be required.

They will require signiﬁcant rf acceleration (

100 MeV) and several meters of high

ﬁeld solenoids interspersed with bending magnets and, for a ﬁnal stage demonstration,

≈

current carrying lithium rods. Such an experiment has not been designed yet. It has

been suggested that this experiment might be carried out at FNAL.

An R & D program would also be required to develop the current carrying rods.

This could be undertaken in a collaboration between BINP, Novosibirsk, and FNAL.

Magnet Design and Acceleration Experimental R & D. R & D programs

are required both for the high ﬁeld pulsed cosine theta magnets and for the lower ﬁeld

pulsed ﬁeld magnets. The R & D on the former is somewhat more urgent since they

are less conventional.

Some R & D work is also needed to determine the performance of the required

superconducting cavities when excited for the relatively short pulse durations required.

Studies of their sensitivity to muon decay electrons may also be needed.

88

Collider Ring Experimental R & D. The insertion quadrupoles need urgent

R & D because the lattice design work depends on the gradients that are achieved.
Nb3Sn, or other higher ﬁeld conductor will be prefered. Since the magnets operate at a
constant ﬁeld, metallic insulation may be acceptable, which would obviate the need for
impregnation and thus provide better cooling. High Tc materials should be considered.
The dipole magnets, if of cosine theta design, may develop excessive mid plane

compression in their coils. Block conductor arrangements may need to be developed.
The use of Nb3Sn will again be prefered for its high ﬁeld capability.

Detector Experimental R & D. Detector R & D is required to develop the

required detectors and conﬁrm that they can both withstand the expected radiation

and separate the tracks of interest from the background.

1.7 CONCLUSION

The initial motive for the study of µ+µ− colliders was:

•

•

– The lack of beamstrahlung constraints allowing the circulation of muons, and

the suppression of beamstrahlung which could, in principle, give a luminosity
an advantage relative to e+e−at high energies.

– The realization that, despite the problems in using muons whose lifetime
is short and production diﬀuse, it is possible to sketch a design for µ+µ−
collider with parameters:

Energy = 4 TeV

Luminosity = 1035 (cm−2sec−1)

∗

∗

∗

More moderate power requirements and tolerances than those in an
e+e−collider with the same speciﬁcation.

A µ+µ− collider would have some unique Physics Advantages:

– Because of the lack of beamstrahlung, a µ+µ− collider could have very narrow

energy spread: dE/E = 0.1 - .01 %

– Observed reactions would have low Radiative Corrections;

– Cross Section of µ+µ− to S-channel production of any Higgs Boson (h, H, A)
would be approximately 40,000 times higher than for e+e−. This together
with the above items, would allow precision measurements of masses and
widths not possible with e+e−.

We note that:

– Although a µ+µ− collider is radically diﬀerent from existing machines, yet
it requires no “exotic” technology; rather, its components would be modest

extensions of existing technology, though used in an unusual manner.

– A µ+µ− collider would be a multipurpose facility: besides µ+µ− collisions,
Its proton driver could be a

µ-p and µ-Ion collisions could be possible.

substantial source of spallation neutrons, and intense beams of pions, kaons,

neutrinos and muons would be available.

– A µ+µ− collider would be an order of magnitude smaller in overall size, and
about a factor of 6 less in total tunnel length, than current e+e−collider
designs. Because of its small size, it would ﬁt on one of several existing lab

sites.

– Consistent with its smaller size, it is estimated that a µ+µ− collider would
be signiﬁcantly cheaper to construct. It might thus become aﬀordable in a

ﬁscal enviroment which may not allow larger “mega- science” projects.

But we recognize disadvantages compared to an e+e−machine:

– A µ+µ− collider would have more background than e+e−.

– The muons would have less polarization than electons, although, in partial

compensation, both µ+and µ−would be equally polarized.

– A gamma-gamma capability would not be possible.

– Although much progress has been made, the concept of a µ+µ− collider is
immature and there could yet be a fatal ﬂaw or some problem could make

it impossibly expensive.

The µ+µ− collider needs much R & D.

– Both theoretical, the highest proiority items being:

Design and simulate a complete lattice for cooling.

continue to study instabilities in the collider ring.

design collider injection and beam halo scraping.

– and experimental: the highest priority items being

A demonstrate of muon cooling cooling is essential to show that hard-

ware can operate and be stable.

Pion capture and rf phase rotation must be demonstrated.

Many components need modelling, in particular: lithium lenses for cool-

ing, pulsed magnets for acceleration, high ﬁeld quadrupoles for the ﬁnal

focus, large aperture diploles for the collider ring, and muon collimators.

– We estimate that about ﬁve years of R & D is needed.

•

If this R & D is successful then we believe a ).5 TeV demonstration collider, with

signiﬁcant physics potential, could be built by 2010; and a 4 TeV collider might

be possible a decade later.

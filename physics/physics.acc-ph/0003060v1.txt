THE HAWKING-UNRUH TEMPERATURE

AND QUANTUM FLUCTUATIONS IN PARTICLE ACCELERATORS

Joseph Henry Laboratories, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544

K. T. McDonald

We wish to draw attention to a novel view of the eﬀect
of the quantum ﬂuctuations during the radiation of accel-
erated particles, particularly those in storage rings. This
view is inspired by the remarkable insight of Hawking1
that the eﬀect of the strong gravitational ﬁeld of a black
hole on the quantum ﬂuctuations of the surrounding space
is to cause the black hole to radiate with a temperature

,

It is suggestive to compare the excitation energy U ⋆ =
kT , as would be observed in the particle’s rest frame,
to the rest energy mc2 when the acceleration is due to
laboratory electromagnetic ﬁelds E and B. Noting that
a⋆ = eE ⋆/m we ﬁnd

where the particle’s laboratory momentum is γβmc, and

where g is the acceleration due to gravity at the surface
of the black hole, c is the speed of light, and k is Boltz-
mann’s constant. Shortly thereafter Unruh2 argued that
an accelerated observer should become excited by quan-
tum ﬂuctuations to a temperature

where a⋆ is the acceleration of the observer in its instan-
taneous rest frame.
In a series of papers Bell and co-
workers3−5 have noted that electron storage rings provide
a demonstration of the utility of the Hawking-Unruh tem-
perature, with emphasis on the question of the incomplete
polarization of the electrons due to quantum ﬂuctuations
of synchrotron radiation.

Here we expand slightly on the results of Bell et al., and
encourage the reader to consult the literature for more
detailed understanding.

Applicability of the Idea

When an accelerated charge radiates, the discrete en-
ergy and momentum of the radiated photons induce ﬂuc-
tuations on the motion of the charge. The insight of Un-
ruh is that for uniform linear acceleration (in the absense
of the ﬂuctuations), the ﬂuctuations would excite any in-
ternal degrees of freedom of the charge to the temperature
stated above. His argument is very general (i.e., thermo-
dynamic) in that it does not depend on the details of the
accelerating force, nor of the nature of the accelerated
particle. The idea of an eﬀective temperature is strictly
applicable only for uniform linear acceleration, but should
be approximately correct for other accelerations, such as
that due to uniform circular motion.

A charged particle whose motion is conﬁned by the fo-
cusing system of a particle accelerator exhibits transverse
and longitudinal oscillations about its ideal path. These
oscillations are excited by the quantum ﬂuctuations of the
particle’s radiation, and thus provide an excellent physi-
cal example of the viewpoint of Unruh.

Further, the particles take on a thermal distribution of
energies when viewed in the average rest frame of a bunch,
which transforms to the observed energy spread in the
laboratory. While classical synchrotron radiation would
eventually polarize the spin- 1
2 particles completely, the
thermal ﬂuctuations oppose this, reducing the maximum
beam polarization.

Ecrit = 1.3 × 1016 volts/cm = 4.4 × 1013 gauss.

(Ecrit is the ﬁeld strength at which spontaneous pair pro-
duction becomes highly probable, i.e., the ﬁeld whose
voltage drop across a Compton wavelength is the parti-
cle’s rest energy.) We might expect that the ﬂuctuations
become noticeable when U ⋆ ∼ 0.1 eV, and hence compa-
rable to any other thermal eﬀects in the system, such as
the particle-source temperature.

For linear accelerators Ek ∼ 106 volts/cm at best, so
U ⋆ < 10−5 eV. The eﬀect of quantum ﬂuctuations is of
course negligible because the radiation itself is of little
importance in a linear accelerator.

For an electron storage ring such as LEP, γ ∼ 105,
and B⊥ ∼ 103 gauss, so that U ⋆ ∼ 0.2 eV. For the SSC
proton storage ring, γ ∼ 2 × 104, while B⊥ ∼ 6 × 104
gauss, so that U ⋆ ∼ 2 eV. As is well known, in essentially
all electron storage rings, and in future proton rings, the
eﬀect of quantum ﬂuctuations is quite important.

The remaining discussion is restricted to beams in stor-

age rings (= transverse particle accelerators).

Beam-Energy Spread

An immediate application of the excitation energy U ⋆ is
to the beam-energy spread. In the average rest frame of a
bunch of particles, the distribution of energies is approx-
imately thermal, with characteristic kinetic energy U ⋆,
and momentum p⋆ = √2mU ⋆. The spread in laboratory
energies is then given by

Ulab ≈ γ(mc2 + U ⋆ ± βp⋆c) ≈ U0 1 ± γs λC
πρ! ,

where U0 = γmc2 is the nominal beam energy, ρ =
U0/eB⊥ is the radius of curvature of the central orbit,
and λC = ¯h/mc is the Compton wavelength. Writing
this as

U0(cid:19)2

we obtain the standard result, as given by equation (5.48)
of the review by Sands.6

which is about 1.5 times Unruh’s result for linear accel-
eration.

Beam Height

Radiation Spectrum

The quantum ﬂuctuations of synchrotron radiation
drive the oscillations of particles about the bunch cen-
ter, and set lower limits on the transverse and longitudi-
nal beam size. If we associate a harmonic oscillator with
each component of the motion about the bunch center,
then each oscillator will be excited to amplitudes whose
corresponding energy is U ⋆ = kT ⋆.

For example, consider the vertical betatron oscillations
which determine the beam height. The frequency of these
oscillations is ω = νzω0 = νzc/R, where νz is the vertical
betatron number, and R = L/2π is the mean radius of
the storage ring.
In the average rest frame of a bunch
the oscillation frequency appears to be ω⋆ = γω, and the
spring constant in this frame is given by k⋆ = mω⋆2 =
γ 2mω2. The typical amplitude of oscillation in this frame
is then

noting that in uniform circular motion the acceleration
is transverse. For the vertical oscillation the lab frame
amplitude z is the same as z ⋆. Combining the above we
ﬁnd

z 2 =

λC R2
πν 2
z ρ

,

which reproduces the standard result, such as equation
(5.107) of Sands.6

An analogous argument is given in ref. 5 to derive the

beam height in a weakly focused storage ring.

Bunch Length and Beam Width

A similar analysis can be given for oscillations in the
plane of the orbit. However, radial and longitudinal ex-
cursions are also directly coupled to energy excursions,
which proves to be the stronger eﬀect. As the present
method ﬁnds the standard result for the beam-energy
spread, the usual results for bunch length and beam width
follow at once. [In ref. 6, use equations (5.64) and (5.93)
to yield expressions (5.65) and (5.95).]

Beam Polarization

Sokolov and Ternov7 predicted that quantum ﬂuctua-
tions in synchrotron radiation limit the transverse polar-
ization of the beam to 92%. In the absense of quantum
ﬂuctuations the polarization should reach 100% after long
times. Bell and Leinaas3 realized that the thermal char-
acter of the ﬂuctuations provides an alternate view of the
depolarizing mechanism. In ref. 5 they provide a detailed
justiﬁcation that the thermodynamic arguments are fully
equivalent to the original QED calculation of Sokolov and
Ternov. In the process they ﬁnd that for circular motion
in a weakly focused ring (betatron), the eﬀective temper-
ature due to quantum ﬂuctuations is

kT =

Because of the quantum ﬂuctuations the motion of the
particles departs from the central orbit, and a classical
calculation of the synchrotron-radiation spectrum is in-
correct in principle. The deviations become signiﬁcant
only when the characteristic energy of the radiation ap-
proaches the beam energy, i.e., when γB⊥/Ecrit ∼ 1, and
the prominent eﬀect is the cutoﬀ at the high-energy end
of the spectrum.

In the regime where the quantum corrections to the
radiation spectrum are small the author has given an
estimate of their size.8 For this we imagine the accel-
erated charge is surrounded (in its rest frame) by a
bath of photons with a Planck spectrum of temperature
kT = ¯ha⋆/2πc. The correction to the classical spectrum
is considered to arise from the Thomson scattering of
these virtual photons oﬀ the charged particle.
In the
lab frame the spectral correction is proportional to the
Lorentz transform of the Planck spectrum, whose peak
photon energy is then 2γkT = ¯hγ 3c/πρ, essentially the
same as that of the classical spectrum. On integrating
over energy, the total rate of the correction term is the
classical (Larmor) rate times

which is indeed very small at present storage rings.

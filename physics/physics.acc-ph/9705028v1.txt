Beam stability and halo formation in high-intensity axi-
symmetric 2D beams in a uniform focusing channel are ana-
lyzed using particle-in-cell simulations. The tune depression
- mismatch space is explored for the uniform (KV) distribu-
tion of the particle transverse-phase-space density, as well as
for more realistic ones (in particular, the water-bag distribu-
tion), to determine the stability limits and halo parameters.
The numerical results show an agreement with predictions of
the analytical model for halo formation [1].

I. INTRODUCTION

There is an increasing interest in high-current applica-
tions of ion linacs, such as the transformation of radioac-
tive waste, the production of tritium, and fusion drivers.
High currents of the order of 100 mA restrict beam losses
below 1 ppm. Thorough studies are necessary to under-
stand mechanisms of intense-beam losses, in particular,
beam instabilities and halo formation.

Most of the theoretical eﬀorts so far have concentrated
on the Kapchinsky-Vladimirsky (KV) distribution of par-
ticles in transverse phase space [2]. The KV beam density
is uniform so that space-charge forces inside the beam are
linear. It allows an analytical investigation and results
are used to predict the behavior of real beams. On the
other hand, it is recognized that the KV model, in which
all particles have the same transverse energy, is not a
realistic beam distribution, e.g. [3]. The present paper
compares the KV beam with other, nonlinear particle-
density distributions, which can serve as better models
for real beams.

II. ANALYTICAL CONSIDERATION

We study a continuous axisymmetric ion beam in a
uniform focusing channel, with longitudinal velocity vz =
βc. The Hamiltonian of the transverse motion (v⊥
vz)
is

is the distance from the z-axis in the transverse plane,
x′2 + y′2 (x′ = ˙x/βc, y′ = ˙y/βc) is the dimen-
and s =

where f (x, y, x′, y′) = f (r, s) is the distribution function
in the transverse non-relativistic 4-D phase space. The
integral on the RHS is the particle density d(r).

Since the Hamiltonian (1) is an integral of motion, any
distribution function of the form f (r, s) = f (H(r, s)) is
a stationary distribution. We consider a speciﬁc set of
stationary distributions for which the beam has a sharp

FIG. 2. The same as Fig. 1, but for the WB beam.

Comparison of Figs. 1 and 2 shows that for these pa-
rameters the WB beam remains stable much longer than
the KV one, but eventually it also blows up and some
particles form a halo far from the beam core. Results
for the n = 2 distribution are similar to those for WB.
Some results depend on simulation parameters; e.g., it
takes a smaller number of the breathing periods for a
beam to blow up if Npar is smaller (i.e., higher noise).
However, the maximum radius, as well as the fraction of
particles outside the core, are practically independent of
Npar. The number of particles which go into the halo
and produce jumps of rmax seen in Figs. 1-2, might be
rather small. We deﬁne the halo intensity h as the num-
ber of particles outside the boundary rb = 1.75a divided
by Npar. Such a deﬁnition is arbitrary, but convenient
to compare beam halos over a wide range of tune depres-
sions. While the beam behavior in Figs. 1 and 2 seems
qualitatively similar, the halos for these two cases are
10−3 for KV, and about 100
very diﬀerent: h
times less for the WB, with only a few particles in the
halo (less than 10 of 256K). That is the reason for os-
cillations of rmax in Fig. 2: these few halo particles can
initially all come back to the core simultaneously.

III. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

We use particle-in-cell simulations to study beam sta-
bility and halo formation in the presence of instabilities.
A leap-frog integration is applied to trace the time evo-
lution for a given initial phase-space distribution. The
space-charge radial electric ﬁeld of an axisymmetric beam
can be found from Gauss’ law by counting the numbers
of particles in cells of a ﬁnite radial grid, which extends
up to four times the beam matched radius. The initial
phase-space state is populated randomly but in accor-
dance with (3) for a chosen n. The matched distributions
remain stable except for a minor dilution related to nu-
merical errors. However, even the matched KV beam is
unstable for η
0.4, in agreement with existing theory
≤
[5] and earlier simulations [6].

i = ˜r′

The beam breathing oscillations are excited by load-
ing a mismatched initial distribution ri = µ˜ri, r′
i/µ,
where ˜ri, ˜r′
i correspond to the matched one, and the mis-
1. A typical range of the simula-
match parameter µ
tion parameters: time step ∆t = T /100, where T is the
period of breathing oscillations, total number of parti-
cles Npar = 16K to 4096K, where K = 1024, and radial
mesh size ∆r = a/128 to a/16. The code performs simu-
lations of about 100 breathing oscillations per CPU hour
for Npar = 256K on Sun UltraSparc 1/170.

≤

≥

The beam behavior is studied as a function of tune
depression η and mismatch µ. Due to a discrete ﬁlling
of a mismatched beam distribution in simulations and,
for n
1, due to non-linear space-charge forces, higher
modes are excited in addition to the breathing mode.
Some of them can be unstable depending on values of η
and µ. A detailed numerical study of stability and halo
formation for the KV beam and its comparison with the
theory predictions [5,1] have already been reported in
[7,8]. Here we compare results for diﬀerent transverse
distributions.
In Figs. 1-2 the maximal radius of the
whole ensemble of particles is plotted versus the number
of breathing oscillations for the KV and WB beams, for
the particular case of η = 0.7 and µ = 0.8 (Npar = 256K,
∆r = a/64).

FIG. 3. Beam behavior (qualitatively) versus tune depres-

sion η and mismatch µ.

A qualitative picture of the beam behavior for various
values of the tune depression and mismatch is shown in
Fig. 3, and is practically the same for all distributions
studied.
’H’ corresponds to beam instability with halo
formation, usually with a noticeable emittance growth,
’U’ means that the beam is unstable but a halo is not
observed in our simulations, and ’S’ indicates beam sta-
bility. The most surprising feature of the diagram is the
lack of any signiﬁcant dependence on η for mismatched
beams; on the contrary, the qualitative changes depend
primarily on µ. When µ changes from 0.6 to 0.8, the
ratio ˜
Eini decreases from 1.7–2 to 1.03–1.07 for the
KV beam, and from 1.4–1.5 to 1.00–1.01 for the WB and
n = 2. The number of breathing periods after which
the beam radius starts to grow noticeably and the halo
forms, has some dependence on η; it is smaller for small
η.

Ef in/ ˜

We performed a systematic study of the KV, WB, and
n = 2 distributions for tunes η from 0.1 to 0.9 and mis-
matches µ from 0.6 to 1.0. Figure 4 shows the ratios of
the halo radius to that of the matched beam for the KV
and WB beams with three diﬀerent mismatches, µ = 0.6,
0.7, and 0.8. Results for n = 2 beam are not shown; they
are slightly lower than those for the WB beam. The
KV halo has a larger radius, especially with small space
charge (large η), but for space-charge dominated beams,
at very small η, the ratios converge for all distributions.
The analytical model for the KV halo formation [1] pre-
dicts ﬁnite values of rmax/a between 2 and 2.5 depending
on η and µ. One can see from simulations that it works
well also for WB and n = 2 beams.

Simulation results for halo intensity h are shown in
Fig. 5 for KV and WB distributions. Again, results for
n = 2 are just slightly lower than for the WB beam, and
not shown. The intensity depends essentially on the mis-
match, and decreases quickly as the mismatch decreases.
The WB halo is about 2–3 times less intense than the
KV halo for small space charge and large mismatch (0.6
and 0.7) but, for space-charge dominated beams, the in-
tensities are about the same. For µ = 0.8, however, the
WB halo is at least an order of magnitude less intense
than the KV one; it is not even included in Fig. 5. An
apparent decrease of h as η decreases is due to the deﬁni-
tion used: the halo boundary radius rb = 1.75a increases
as 1/√η. If a ﬁxed boundary is used instead, the same
for all tunes, the halo intensity would be larger for larger
space charge.

One more interesting feature is how fast the halo de-
velops. For the KV beam, the process is usually rather
fast, and the halo saturates after a few hundred breath-
ing periods. For the WB and n = 2 distributions, it con-
tinues to grow rather slowly, and asymptotic values are
usually reached after a few thousand breathing oscilla-
tions; it takes especially long for η
0.3. Data plotted in
Fig. 5 correspond to the asymptotic values, after N=5000
breathing periods for WB and after N=600 for KV (ex-

0.2, where KV results are also for N=5000).
These 5000 breathing oscillations correspond to 5–10 km
of the length for a typical machine, much longer than
existing proton linacs.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Our simulations show the qualitative similarity of the
beam behavior for all transverse distributions studied.
The KV beam can be considered as an extreme case com-
pared to the WB and n = 2 distributions which are closer
to real beams. The halo intensity is a few times higher
and saturates faster for the KV distribution than for the
other two.

An interesting new observation is that for axisymmet-
ric beams under consideration the beam stability and
halo formation depend primarily on the mismatch, not
on the tune shift. The halo was clearly observed only for
large mismatches, at least 20%, and its radius is in agree-
ment with the analytical model [1] for halo formation.

Abstract

We study the modiﬁcations of synchrotron radiation of charges in a stor-
age ring as they are cooled. The pair correlation lengths between the charges
are manifest in the synchrotron radiation and coherence eﬀects exist for wave-
lengths longer than the coherence lengths between the charges. Therefore the
synchrotron radiation can be used as a diagnostic tool to determine the state
(gas, liquid, crystal) of the charged plasma in the storage ring. We show
also that the total power of the synchrotron radiation is enormously reduced
for crystallized beams. This opens the possibility of accelerating particles to
ultra-relativistic energies using small–sized cyclic accelerators.

I. INTRODUCTION

Ion–beam crystallization is an exciting and relatively new ﬁeld of physics in which a new
state of matter is sought for. Namely, ions which rapidly circulate in a storage ring and
are cooled are expected to form geometrically–ordered structures (crystals) which have a
density much smaller than normal crystalline solids [1,2]. Although great eﬀort is currently
invested in achieving such crystals [2–4], and cooling techniques were signiﬁcantly improved
[5], there is still no clear–cut experimental evidence for them. It is hoped, however, that
crystalline beams will be produced in the near future.

Synchrotron radiation, on the other hand, is a very well-established ﬁeld of physics
that has been investigated continuously from the early days of particle accelerators. Many
synchrotron sources are operating around the world (e.g., DESY (Hamburg, Germany),
NSLS (Brookhaven, USA), KEK (Tsukuba, Japan)), and many applications already exist
[6].

It is the purpose of this paper to establish a link between beam crystallization and

synchrotron radiation. This link is two–fold:

•

•

To use synchrotron radiation and modiﬁcations thereof in order to detect the creation
and existence of beam crystals. This is required since for fast beams direct detection
methods are diﬃcult to implement [2]. Thus synchrotron radiation can be used as an
indirect diagnostic method to detect the formation of beam crystals. The diagnostic
methods discussed below are also applicable to liquid and gaseous beams.

Even more importantly, once beam crystals are formed, they can be used to modify
the synchrotron radiation with respect to the ordinary incoherent case. Therefore one
can achieve dramatic suppression and enhancement eﬀects of synchrotron radiation
using crystallized beams [7]. In particular, the total power that is radiated from an
equi-spaced circulating chain of particles is much smaller (in the appropriate limits
[7]) than the radiation from the same number of randomly–located particles. This
opens the possibility for accelerating particles to ultra-relativistic energies with little
radiation loss, which is currently the main limitation of circular electron accelerators.
Thus the suppression of synchrotron radiation by beam crystallization may eventually
lead to the construction of smaller–sized circular electron accelerators.

In the following we shall detail the connection between beam crystals and synchrotron
radiation.
It is important to emphasize that currently researchers are trying to obtain
beam crystals of heavy ions that can be cooled with electrons and lasers. For heavy ions,
however, the synchrotron radiation is small. Even for protons, e.g., the lightest of the “heavy
ions”, the synchrotron radiation is about a factor 10−13 smaller than for electrons with the
same energy. Thus, we expect that realistically the eﬀects predicted in this paper will be
important only for liquid or crystallized electron beams. This, however, poses the challenge
of obtaining crystallized electron beams. Thus we hope that the ideas put forward in this
paper will motivate experimentalists to work towards obtaining crystallized electron beams.
In any case, however, the analysis presented below applies to any species of charged particles.
Thus the theory can in principle be veriﬁed for ion–beam crystals. Also we stress from the
outset that the eﬀects discussed below go beyond what is known as “coherent synchrotron
radiation” which is the coherent enhancement of synchrotron radiation of small electron

2

bunches for wavelengths that are longer than the bunch size (see, e.g., [8–11] and Sec. IV
below).

The paper is structured in the following way. In Sec. II we discuss the general theory
that underlies the suppression and enhancement eﬀects of synchrotron radiation. In Sec.
III the theory is applied to the three phases of a coasting charged–particle beam that occur
in practice: Gaseous, liquid and crystal.
In Sec. IV the necessary modiﬁcations of the
theory for a bunched beam are discussed. In Sec. V we present analytical and numerical
results concerning the suppression of synchrotron radiation by a crystalline beam. Finite
temperature eﬀects are discussed explicitly. In Sec. VI we discuss our results and conclude
the paper with proposals for experimental applications of the eﬀects discussed in this paper.

II. GENERAL THEORY

We consider N charged particles with charge q circulating in a circular storage ring
of radius ρ with velocity v. The charges are assumed to be coherent with a reference
circulating charge, but are allowed to have constant time lags ∆tj as well as constant spatial
displacements ∆~rj from the reference orbit. According to the theory of radiation of moving
sources, the total power that is emitted from the N charges is given by [12,13]

calculations and gives qualitatively the same results. It is also compatible with the current
experimental trend according to which linear ion crystals (one–dimensional crystals) are
sought for. We shall denote in the following the phase diﬀerences by θj ≡

the modiﬁcations of synchrotron radiation due to coherence eﬀects is R2, our main object
of study. The physics of the particle beam (temperature, structure) is reﬂected in R2 and is
consequently linked to modiﬁcations of the synchrotron radiation.

Before applying the above formulas, we make some further simple manipulations. To

avoid complications with the 2π-periodicity we deﬁne

III. APPLICATION TO COOLED PARTICLE BEAMS

In the following we shall study a few representative situations of a particle beam as
it is being cooled and crystallized. We shall qualitatively infer the form of the two–point
correlator ˜R2 for each of the cases, and calculate the resulting form factor of the synchrotron
radiation. Thus the focus in this section is on the spectral modiﬁcations of the synchrotron
radiation expressed by the behavior of
as
the temperature is lowered deﬁnes an excellent tool for the diagnostics of the thermodynamic
state of the beam. The modiﬁcations due to bunching are considered in Sec. IV. The
suppression of the total emitted power is discussed in Sec. V.

. We shall show that the modiﬁcations of

We start with a very hot particle beam. In such a case we expect the particles to be
completely independent. Therefore equations (2.12) and (2.13) apply. For a particle beam
that ﬁlls the whole ring (coasting beam) we expect on the basis of symmetry a uniform
distribution

P1(θ) =

The form factor becomes

In the bunched case, therefore, in addition to the incoherent term N, we also obtain a term
that represents the coherent synchrotron radiation for low harmonics n <
1/σ. One obtains
∼
qualitatively the same results for other shapes of the bunch [17,18].

The above results are well-known and form the basis of the ﬁeld of “coherent synchrotron
radiation” in which enhancement of the radiation is predicted [12,17,8,16] and experimentally
measured [9–11] due to the collection of the charges (electrons) into small bunches. In our
case this applies to the limiting case of a bunched but very hot beam of particles in which
the particles within the bunch are uncorrelated.

In the following we shall introduce the correlations between the particles as the beam is
cooled and use the full expressions (2.5)–(2.11) rather than (2.13). These correlations are

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

neglected in the ﬁeld of coherent synchrotron radiation since the beam is assumed to be very
hot. But the correlations become more and more important as the beam is being cooled. To
simplify the treatment, we focus in this section on coasting beams. In Sec. IV we introduce
the necessary modiﬁcations to describe bunched beams.

If the temperature of the beam is moderately high, we expect that the particles start to
show repulsion from each other. That is, they will avoid the vicinity of each other due to the
Coulomb repulsion and act like a non-ideal “gas”. This can be described phenomenologically
by

is the trivial two–point correlator for a uniformly coasting beam of independent particles
and a is the (angular) “hard–core” scale of repulsion. Interpreting (3.6), we modiﬁed ˜R0

a narrow “dip” of width a near ∆ = 0 (the “correlation hole”) such that ˜R2(0) = 0 (total

repulsion at ∆ = 0). The constant c1 is for normalization. It is approximately (1
π). Actually, since we are still in the high temperature regime, we
for small values of a (a

here, the two conditions on a are consistent. We note that a depends on the temperature

This result is intuitively clear since the hard core cannot be larger than the mean distance
of the particles. It is also compatible with the assumptions above concerning a. Physically,
we observe that there is a suppression of the synchrotron radiation for n <
1/a (lower
∼
harmonics). We can therefore estimate the hard–core scale (and hence the temperature)
from the coherent modiﬁcations of the synchrotron radiation for the gas–like state of the
particle beam. We note that the overall suppression eﬀect is small. For small n values,
where the reduction of the emitted power is largest, the relative suppression with respect to
the incoherent case amounts to only

When the temperature becomes smaller such that the Coulomb energy is comparable to
the thermal energy, we expect the particle beam to become somewhat ordered and to form
a liquid–like plasma. The partial order is a precursor to crystallization. In particular, the
(angular) distance on which the repulsion between particles is manifest is dθ, and the order
eﬀects should persist over a few mean distances. The two–point correlator is qualitatively
given by

above two–point correlator displays a strong repulsion for small distances ( ˜Rliq

as well as oscillations that persist for a few mean distances.
It eventually reaches the
asymptotic limit of uncorrelated particles. Thus it represents an intermediate situation
(“liquid”) between the slight mutual repulsion (“gas”) treated above and long–range order
(“crystal”) discussed below. The above expression was obtained as a result of an exact
calculation for a one–dimensional chain of particles with logarithmic repulsion by Dyson in
the context of Random Matrix Theory [19]. The resulting form factor is

(3.12)

Thus, the suppression eﬀect is very prominent in this situation, and there is eﬀectively
complete suppression of the synchrotron radiation for small values of n (see also Fig. 2). In
terms of wavelength, the suppression is felt for wavelengths that are comparable or longer
than the mean distance between the particles. Comparing (3.8) and (3.12) we conclude that
as the order becomes more manifest (temperature decreases) the suppression eﬀect becomes
more prominent, but the onset of suppression is shifted to longer wavelengths.

As crystallization takes place, long–range order eﬀects become important. We consider
in the following the simplest crystal, namely the linear chain. To describe the situation
we assume a distribution function that corresponds to a thermal distribution of small dis-
placements around the crystalline state with only nearest–neighbor interactions taken into
account for simplicity:

We note that the assumption of only nearest–neighbor interactions is not severe since for

In order to obtain the above result we assumed Γ
1, i.e. a cold beam. This is a necessary
condition for crystallization. In order to interpret this result, we consider two limiting cases.
If the maximal exponent in (3.19) (as a function of l), given by n2π2/(4ΓN), is much smaller
than 1, we can replace the exponential in (3.19) with 1 and get

otherwise.

This means that for very cold crystals there is a total suppression of the radiation for all
harmonics, except the ones that are divisible by the number of particles N. For these special
harmonics we get total constructive interference. The suppression of the leading harmonics
results in an enormous reduction of the total power emitted by the synchrotron radiation
(see Sec. V). In case crystallized electron beams can be produced, this eﬀect gives rise to the
possibility of signiﬁcantly reducing the synchrotron radiation, currently the main limitation
for circular electron accelerators. We mention in passing that the result (3.20) can also be
obtained directly from calculating the form factor for a completely frozen crystal [7,12,13].
The other limit of (3.19) is for the ﬁrst exponential factor (l = 1) to be already small, such
that only the ﬁrst term needs to be considered. That is, for n2π2/(ΓN 2)

1, we obtain

which describes small “ripples” over the incoherent radiation, with decaying amplitude that
has oscillations with period N.
In Fig. 3 we plot the numerically computed form factor
(3.19) for the speciﬁc cases N = 106, Γ = 101, 102, 106. For Γ = 106 we see a series of sharp
peaks located at n/N = 1, 2, . . . . This is expected since in this case Γ is very large and thus
(3.20) holds approximately for the range of n shown in Fig. 3. For smaller values of Γ we
observe a transition from sharp peaks to decaying ripples. Even in the case Γ = 106 the
sharp peaks will eventually die away.

This deﬁnes a useful diagnostic tool for measuring the temperature of the crystal. We also
conclude that crystalline beams can be applied to selectively suppress and enhance harmonics
of the radiation, achieving up to total suppression (gn = 0) or total constructive interference
(gn = N 2).

To summarize this section, we have shown that the synchrotron radiation and its modi-
ﬁcations with respect to the incoherent state are strongly connected with the physical state
of the beam. The form factor reﬂects the important scales and can be used to diagnose the
state of the beam (“gas”, “liquid”, “solid”) as well as its temperature.

IV. MODIFICATIONS FOR BUNCHED BEAMS

Experimentally it is sometimes useful to work with bunched beams in which the particles
occupy only a small fraction of the ring. Thus we consider in this section the modiﬁcations
of the above theory for bunched beams. These modiﬁcations are straightforward. It turns
out that only the lowest harmonics (up to n
2π/(bunch angular length)) are aﬀected.
Qualitatively this can be understood by examining equation (2.6), since the bunching will
2π. This yields the above estimate. In

We start with the gaseous phase and consider a narrow bunch of N particles with an
(eﬀective) angular width σ

the shape of the bunch is a Gaussian, and that the (one–point) charge density is given by
equation (3.4) above. In the absence of correlations, the two–point correlation function of
the Gaussian bunch reads

That is, the form factor of the gaseous coasting beam contains an additional enhancement

To summarize this section, we investigated the modiﬁcations that result from the bunch-
ing of the particle beam. In all cases we found that a signiﬁcant enhancement occurs for
the low harmonics n <
Q. Otherwise we get qualitatively the same results as for a coasting

beam.

In Secs. III and IV we concentrated on a discussion of the form factor gn of the beam.
We showed that important information on the thermodynamic state of the beam is already
contained in gn. The total emitted power, however, the subject of this section, depends on

This result agrees with Larmor’s well-known formula for the total radiated power of a single
charge in the nonrelativistic limit [13]. We introduce the parameter s = βγ. It characterizes
the three relativistic regimes important for the discussion in this paper: Nonrelativistic
(s

(5.1) we deﬁne the normalized power levels

In the case of N incoherently radiating charges we have α(N, β) = 1. A suppression ef-
fect corresponds to α(N, β) < 1. Enhancement of synchrotron radiation corresponds to
α(N, β) > 1.

The behavior of ˜I (1)

of the total emitted synchrotron power. It is qualitatively diﬀerent in the three relativistic

This behavior is illustrated in Fig. 5(c) for the case s = 10 (full line). The analytical results

in the appropriate limits. We now show that the behavior of ˜I (1)
in conjunction with the

behavior of gn leads to substantial suppression of synchrotron radiation for cold beams.

We ﬁrst discuss the case of a coasting crystallized linear chain at T = 0. It consists of
N equi-spaced particles according to θj = 2πj/N, j = 1, 2, . . . , N. For gn we have the result
(3.20). For the suppression factor α we obtain in this case

to a very good approximation. Therefore α is exponentially small for N > N0. In other
words: For large enough particle number we obtain exponential suppression of synchrotron
radiation independently of the relativistic regime of the beam. This result is illustrated in
case). It shows the suppression factor for s = 0.1, 1 and 10 as a function

predicted from the structure of (5.9).

Fig. 6 shows that the analytical formulae are very good approximations of the numerical
data in their respective ranges of validity.

Next we consider the linear chain at ﬁnite temperature.

In this case the form factor
(3.19) applies. Because of the structure of (3.19) and the asymptotic exponential decay of
˜I (1)
n for large n we can compute the asymptotic behavior of α(N, β) for large N. Using (3.22)

Thus, for large N and in all three relativistic regimes, the asymptotic suppression is inde-
pendent of N and saturates at α = 1/(2Γ). This behavior is illustrated in Fig. 6 which shows
for all three values of s considered. The onset
the suppression factor for Γ = 10, 100 and
of saturation in the vicinity of some N = Nc is physically clear because of the following
reason. Finite Γ corresponds to a ﬁnite temperature which furthermore corresponds to a
ﬁnite correlation length of the particles in the linear chain. But since the suppression of the
synchrotron radiation is a coherent process it is intuitively clear that no further suppression
can be achieved once the total particle number exceeds the correlation length. Consequently
the suppression eﬀect has to saturate.

∞

In Sec. III we pointed out that measuring the depth of the correlation hole in gcry
for
small values of n deﬁnes an experimental method for measuring the plasma parameter of
the beam. Since the saturation value of α depends only on Γ, measuring the suppression
factor for large N deﬁnes yet another experimental procedure for measuring Γ.

n

The existence of a ﬁnite correlation length at ﬁnite temperature provides an argument
why it is not necessary to maintain coherence over the whole circumference of the storage ring
in order to observe the suppression eﬀect. It is enough to work with bunches whose length
is smaller or of the order of Nc to observe suppression of synchrotron radiation. From the
mathematical point of view this is also evident since we saw that for ﬁnite temperature only
lower harmonics of gn are aﬀected by the bunching, hence gcry,bunch
gcry
m·N , m = 1, 2, . . . for
large enough N, and therefore we expect similar suppression as for the coasting case. This
result is very important for practical applications of the suppression eﬀect. It means that the
coherence does not have to be maintained over the whole extent of the ring, which sometimes
can amount to hundreds of meters and more.
It is enough to maintain the crystalline
structure over small angular distances (bunches) in order to exploit the suppression eﬀect
in possible technical applications.

m·N

≈

It is also clear by inspection of Fig. 5 and of Fig. 2(b) that for large enough N substantial
suppression of synchrotron radiation can be achieved for liquid beams. This, again, is
important since modern electron coolers are close to providing a liquid beam of electrons.
Thus it may soon be possible to check our theory with the help of liquid electron beams.

VI. DISCUSSION, SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The suppression of the radiation of geometrically ordered charges was ﬁrst noticed by
J. J. Thomson [20]. He employed this eﬀect for motivating the stability of atoms, which,
according to classical theory, should radiate and decay. Suppression of synchrotron radiation
in the context of accelerators was ﬁrst noted by L. I. Schiﬀ [12]. But in Schiﬀ’s time a
mechanism for establishing the order in a beam of charged particles was not available. Only
recently, with progress in the cooling of beams by electrons and lasers is it possible to
envision the production of crystallized beams whose synchrotron radiation is exponentially
small. It should be born in mind, however, that synchrotron radiation is not very important
for heavy ion beams that can easily be cooled with electrons and lasers. Dramatic eﬀects are
expected to occur only for crystallized electrons where the synchrotron radiation is orders of
magnitude stronger. The draw-back is that electrons cannot be cooled directly with lasers.
We hope, however, that this paper will stimulate experimentalists to develop cooling schemes
for electron beams. One possibility would be to use sympathetic cooling of electrons with a
beam of heavy ions that can be cooled by lasers.

The paper discusses various forms of ordered beams that may occur in practice: Gaseous,
liquid and crystalline, coasting and bunched. It is pointed out that the suppression eﬀect
occurs on two levels: In the form factor of the beam and in the total radiated power. While
the modiﬁcations in the form factor may be used as a diagnostic tool for inferring the
thermodynamic state of the beam, the suppression of the total power may eventually lead
to the construction of small–sized cyclic electron accelerators.

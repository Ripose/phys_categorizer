Laser Cooling of TeV Muons∗

We show that Compton scattering can be used to cool TeV-scale muon beams, and we derive analytical
expressions for the equilibrium transverse angular spread, longitudinal energy spread, and power requirements.
We ﬁnd that a factor of a few thousand reduction in emittance is possible for a 3 TeV muon collider.

1. Introduction

Muon colliders are a possible future tool for
the exploration of physics at the TeV scale and
beyond. The current status of the developent of
the muon collider concept is described in Ref. [1],
which includes a description of a 3 TeV center-of-
mass (COM) machine.

One of the major challenges to realizing a high-
luminosity muon collider is to cool the diﬀuse
bunches of muons produced in pion decays. Much
eﬀort is being put into the problem of quickly
cooling these bunches at the front-end of a muon-
collider and maintaining the low emittance while
bunches are being accelerated and brought into
collision.

For the 3 TeV COM machine, the problems of
neutrino radiation [2] and power consumption are
already becoming prohibitive. Additional cooling
of the bunches after acceleration would mitigate
these problems by allowing a given luminosity to
be attained with fewer stored muons and a lower
repitition rate, and allow consideration of even
higher energy muon colliders. For example, the
tunnels and high-ﬁeld magnets being discussed
for future hadron colliders [3] could ultimately be
used for a 100 TeV-scale muon collider. Post-
acceleration cooling would also reduce detector
backgrounds from muon decay.

The possibility of using Compton scattering
for cooling of electron bunches for γγ collid-
ers has been previously considered [4]. The lu-
minosity for e+e− collisions is already limited
by beamstrahlung eﬀects, but additional cooling
may greatly improve the γγ luminosity.

We propose herein the possibility of post-
acceleration cooling of muons beams using Comp-
ton scattering.

2. Compton Scattering

The Compton Scattering cross-section, in the

rest frame of the muon, is:

where

k′ =

(1)

(2)

and k is the incoming photon energy, k′ is the out-
going photon energy, and θ is the photon scatter-
ing angle. For k ≪ m, k′ ≈ k and the scattering
is roughly isotropic:

dσ

∝ (1 + cos2 θ),

and the total cross-section is given by:

where r2
µ is the classical muon radius. Thus, com-
pared to electrons, the cross-section is reduced by
≈ 4 × 104.

As an example, to expect 1 collision with a 0.1
eV photon, the light energy density would need
to be 10 J/(µm)2.

Consider a beam of muons, with energy and
momentum deﬁned by β, γ, Eµ, and pµ, colliding
head-on with a mono-energetic beam of photons

2

with energy Eγ. We will approximate β = 1. The
energy of the photons in the muon rest frame is:

To ﬁnd the equilibrium angular spread we equate
the cooling and heating eﬀects to ﬁnd:

E ∗

γ = γEγ(1 + β) ≈ 2γEγ.

(5)

On average, the photon will transfer longitudinal
momentum E ∗

γ to the muon. In the lab frame,

Eµ → Eµ − 2γ 2Eγ.

(6)

Typically, the muon will receive a smaller trans-
verse kick:

pT µ ≈ γEγ.

(7)

Therefore, for large γ, the muon is essentially
slowed down without changing direction.

If lower photon energies are needed, this can ef-
fectively be achieved by aiming the photon beam
at an angle θ relative to the head-on direction.
The transverse momentum of the photon is incon-
sequential. The eﬀective photon energy becomes:

σα =s 3

10

Eγ
Eµ

.

(11)

Luminosity is inversely proportional to the
sums of the emittances of the two colliding beams.
It is also proportional to the product of the num-
bers of muons in the two beams. This prod-
uct decays with a time constant of one-half the
muon lifetime. For a fractionally small energy
loss per collision, the number of Compton scat-
terings needed to reduce σα by a factor of 1/e is
given by:
m

(12)

n =

2γEγ

The total energy used to reaccelerate the muon
after these n collisions is equal the original muon
energy:

Eγ → Eγ(1 + cos θ)/2.

(8)

Ereacc = Eµ.

(13)

3. Cooling Eﬀect

For simplicity, we consider the case that the the
muons undergo on average one Compton scatter-
ing, and are afterwards reaccelerated to compen-
sate for the average energy loss. The following
conclusions are also valid for any average number
of scatterings, as long as the relative energy loss
is small.

Transversely, a muon has a small angle α rela-
tive to the beam direction in a plane, for example
the x − z plane. After the scattering, α remains
unchanged, within an amount Eγ/m. After reac-
celeration,

α → α(1 − 2γEγ/m).

(9)

Thus, the angular spread can be reduced, in the
same way as for ionization cooling at low energy.
There is also a heating eﬀect from the spread in
the transverse kick. The average increase in the
variance of α is equal to that for one Compton
scattering:

The power density needed to attain this factor in
one-half muon lifetime is given by:

p =

nEγ

σCγτµ/2

.

(14)

Thus, the power required decreases as the square
of the muon energy increases.

Longitudinally, since the average energy loss in
a Compton scattering is greater the higher the
muon energy, there is an energy bunching eﬀect.
≪ Eµ, and the average case of one Comp-

ton scattering, the bunching eﬀect is:

(15)

There are also two sources of energy heating. The
ﬁrst is from the variance in the number of Comp-
ton scatterings of the muon, given by Poisson
statistics. This leads to a variance in the en-
ergy spread of (2γ 2Eγ)2. The second is from the
variance in the energy spread within one Comp-
ton scattering, given by 2/5 (2γ 2Eγ)2. The total
heating eﬀect is then:

Equating the heating and cooling eﬀects, we ﬁnd
for the equilibrium energy spread:

(17)

We have checked these derivations with a sim-
ple Monte Carlo simulation of a set of muons
undergoing repeated Compton scatterings and
boosts. The predictions of these equations are
in excellent quantitative agreement with the sim-
ulation.

4. Power Considerations

In principle, Compton scattering could be used
to cool low-energy muons. Unfortunately, our es-
timates show that the power requirements would
be prohibitive by many orders of magnitude.
However, as shown in Eq. 14, the power density
needed decreases as the square of the muon en-
ergy increases, and may be reasonable at TeV en-
ergies.

Two other general considerations aﬀect how the
power needed scales with the muon energy. First,
the muons will be in a storage ring. The pho-
ton pulses can be placed in a cavity and reused
once per turn of the muons around the ring, as
illustrated in Fig. 1. The size of the ring, and
therefore the time per turn, is proportional to the
muon energy. For a lower muon energy, the pho-
ton pulses can be reused at a faster rate. There-
fore, for this scheme, the power needed to produce
the photons scales as only 1/E.

The second consideration is that the geomet-
ric emittance, and therefore spot size, decreases
linearly as the muon bunch is accelerated. There-
fore, the area that needs to be illuminated, and
the total power, decreases as the square of the
muon energy. Putting these two considerations
together, the power needed for cooling scales as
1/E3.

The length of the muon bunch can also aﬀect
the amount of power needed. A laser beam can
be focussed to collide with the muon bunch. The
diﬀraction-limited spot size at the focus is pro-
portional to the F-stop (F ). However, the depth
of focus is proportional to F 2. If the length of the
muon bunch is too long, we will need to increase

the right, one-half cycle later, each photon pulse

the depth of focus, which implies increasing the
spot size, which will require proportionally more
total power.

Finally, Eq. 14 gives only the cooling rate
needed to compensate the luminosity for the
muon decays. A cooling rate several times higher
than this will be necessary to realize large in-
creases in the luminosity. We also note that as
cooling power is added, we also need to add RF
power to reaccelerate the muons, as described in
Eq. 13.

Although a lot of additional power will be
needed for the laser and RF systems, a much
lower repitition rate will be needed for a given
luminosity, and thus the power consumption for
the facility as a whole may be much lower.

5. Application to the 3 TeV Muon Collider

We start with the parameters for the 3 TeV
muon collider in Ref. [1]. The ring has a cir-
cumference of 6 km, and contains 4 bunches at
a time. We assume that this will be reduced to 1
bunch. We have assumed that the bunch length
can be shortened to 1 mm. Midway between each
crossing point, we place a resonant optical cavity.
This is illustrated in Fig. 1. Each cavity contains

a photon pulse reﬂecting back and forth. The
length of the cavity is set to 3 km, so that the
light pulse hits a muon bunch in alternating di-
rections once per reﬂection. The luminosity life-
time is 15 msec, or 750 turns. Thus, the cavity
should have a Q of ≈ 103. The length of the pho-
ton pulse should be comparable to the β ∗ of the
machine, or about 30 ps.

Progress in improving laser intensity and de-
creasing photon pulse widths has been very
rapid [5]. For example, the Mercury project [6]
is developing a 1.05 µm laser system that will
generate 100 J at 10 Hz in 5 ns pulses at 10%
eﬃciency. We have considered two types of laser
systems to generate the necessary photon pulses:
CO2 lasers, which typically have a 10.6 µm wave-
length and 25% eﬃciency, and Nd:Glass lasers,
which typically have a 1.05 µm wavelength and
1% eﬃciency. The parameters of these laser sys-
tems with the 3 TeV COM machine are shown in
Table 1.

As shown in Table 1, we can expect emit-
tance improvements by a factor of a few thou-

sand. However, the energy needed in the laser
pulses is very high: Of order one MJ. The two
laser cooling stations in Fig. 1 would probably
need to be divided into several cooling stations
each with a fraction of the laser energy. Short-
ening the muon bunch length could also allow a
considerable reduction in laser energy.
It may
be possible to exploit the reduction in beam size
that occurs during the cooling process. Finally,
a higher energy muon collider would also reduce
the laser energy requirement.

Some of the other parameters of the collider
with laser cooling may present challenges for the
machine design. The small emittance leads to
a very high value of the tune shift. Also, the
energy spreads are somewhat high, especially for
the lower-wavelength laser.

6. Conclusions

We have shown that Compton scattering can
be used to cool muon beams. Eq. 11 and Eq. 17
describe the achievable transverse angular spread
and longitudinal energy spread.

5

While the power needed for laser cooling of
muon beams is very high, it decreases as the cube
of the muon energy increases, and may become
practical by TeV energies.
If so, emittance re-
ductions by factors of a few thousand are possi-
ble. This would allow a given luminosity to be
attained with a much lower repitition rate, much
less detector background from muon decays, and
a much reduced neutrino radiation hazard. Sev-
eral challenges remain to develop a plausible op-
tical, laser, and machine system.

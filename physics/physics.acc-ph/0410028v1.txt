Intrabeam scattering growth rates for a
bi-gaussian distribution.

BNL REPORT C-A/AP NO.169

Abstract

This note ﬁnds results for the intrabeam scattering growth rates
for a bi-gaussian distribution. The bi-gaussian distribution is inter-
esting for studying the possibility of using electron cooling in RHIC.
Experiments and computer studies indicate that in the presence of
electron cooling, the beam distribution changes so that it developes a
strong core and a long tail which is not described well by a gaussian,
but may be better described by a bi-gaussian. Being able to compute
the eﬀects of intrabeam scattering for a bi-gaussian distribution would
be useful in computing the eﬀects of electron cooling, which depend
critically on the details of the intrabeam scattering. The calculation
is done using the reformulation of intrabeam scattering theory given
in [1] based on the treatments given by A. Piwinski [2] and J. Bjorken
and S.K. Mtingwa [3]. The bi-gaussian distribution is deﬁned below as
the sum of two gaussians in the particle coordinates x, y, s, px, py, ps.
The gaussian with the smaller dimensions produces most of the core
of the beam, and the gaussian with the larger dimensions largely pro-
duces the long tail of the beam. The ﬁnal result for the growth rates
are expressed as the sum of three terms which can be interperted re-
spectively as the contribution to the growth rates due to the scattering
of the particles in the ﬁrst gaussian from themselves, the scattering
of the particles in the second gaussian from themselves, and the scat-
tering of the particles in the ﬁrst gaussian from the particles in the
second gaussian.

1 Introduction

This note ﬁnds results for the intrabeam scattering growth rates for a bi-
gaussian distribution.

The bi-gaussian distribution is interesting for studying the possibility of
using electron cooling in RHIC. Experiments and computer studies indicate
that in the presence of electron cooling, the beam distribution changes so
that it developes a strong core and a long tail which is not described well
by a gaussian, but may be better described by a bi-gaussian. Being able
to compute the eﬀects of intrabeam scattering for a bi-gaussian distribution
would be useful in computing the eﬀects of electron cooling, which depend
critically on the details of the intrabeam scattering. The calculation is done
using the reformulation of intrabeam scattering theory given in [1] based on
the treatments given by A. Piwinski [2] and by J. Bjorken and S. Mtingwa
[3]. The bi-gaussian distribution is deﬁned below as the sum of two gaussians
in the particle coordinates x, y, s, px, py, ps. The gaussian with the smaller
dimensions produces most of the core of the beam, and the gaussian with the
larger dimensions largely produces the long tail of the beam. The ﬁnal result
for the growth rates are expressed as the sum of three terms which can be
interperted respectively as the contribution to the growth rates due to the
scattering of the particles in the ﬁrst gaussian from themselves, the scattering
of the particles in the second gaussian from themselves, and the scattering of
the particles in the ﬁrst gaussian from the particles in the second gaussian.

2 Basic results for intrabeam scattering

This section lists some general results which can be used to ﬁnd growth rates
for a beam with any particle distribution f (x.p). Following [3], growth rates
will be computed for < pipj > , where the <> indicates an average over all
the particles in the bunch. From these one can compute the growth rates for
the emittances, < ǫi >. A result that holds in any coordinate system and for
any particle distribution f (x.p) is given in [1] as

δ < (pipj) > = N

Nf (x, p) gives the number of particles in d3xd3p, where N is the number
of particles in a bunch. δ < (pipj) > is the change in < (pipj) > due to all
particle collisions in the time interval dt. The invariants F (p1, p2), ∆2, W 2

Eq.(1) is considerably simpliﬁed by going to the rest CS , which is the
CS moving along with the bunch and the particle motion is non-relativistic,

bmax is the largest allowed impact parameter in the center of mass CS. It
has been asumed that one can replace ln(1 + (2 ¯β2bmax/r0)
1 by ln(1 +
(2 ¯β2bmax/r0).

−

In Eq.(1), the original 11-dimensional integral which arises from intra-
beam scattering theory has been reduced in [1] to a 9-dimensional integral

3

by integrating over all possible scattering angles. In [1] this reduction was
done for any particle distribution, f (x, p). In [3], Bjorken and Mtingwa ﬁrst
do the integration over x, p1, p2 using a simple gaussian distribution before
doing the integration over the scattering angles and no general result for
doing this reduction for any f (x, p) is given. In [2] Piwinski computes the
growth rates for the emittances < ǫi > instead of for < pipj >. A general
result for reducing the integral by integrating over all possible scattering
angles, for any f (x, p), for the growth rates of < ǫi > is given. However,
using this result for a complicated distribution like the bi-gaussian would be
diﬃcult.

3 Gaussian distribution

We will ﬁrst consider the case of a gaussian particle distribution. This will
provide a more simple example of using the results in the reformulation given
in [1] and of the methods used to evaluate the integrals. Afterwards, the same
procedures will be applied to the case of the bi-gaussian distribution.

Let Nf (x, p) gives the number of particles in d3xd3p, where N is the
number of particles in a bunch. For a gaussian distribution, f (x, p) ls given
by

D is the horizontal dispersion. D′ = dD/ds. A longitudinal emittance has
been introduced so that the longitudinal motion and the transverse motions
can be treated in a similar manner. sc locates the center of the bunch.

Γ can now be computed using Eq.(1).This will provide an example how
the integrals are done in this paper. The integration methods used here are
somewhat more complicated than those used in [3] but they will also work
for the more complicated bi-gaussian distribution.

4 Growth rates for a Gaussian distribution

In the following,the growth rates are given in the Rest Coordinate System,
which is the coordinate system moving along with the bunch. Growth rates
are given for < pipj >. From these one can compute the growth rates for
< ǫi >. Using the general result, Eq.(2), one gets

5 Bi-Gaussian distribution

The bi-gaussian distribution will be assumed to have the form given by the
following.

Nf (x, p) gives the number of particles in d3xd3p, where N is the number

of particles in a bunch. For a bi-gaussian distribution, f (x, p) ls given by

In the ﬁrst gaussian,to ﬁnd Γa, Sa then in the expressions for Γ, S, given
above for the gaussian distribution, replace ¯ǫx, ¯ǫy, ¯ǫs by ¯ǫxa, ¯ǫya, ¯ǫsa. In the
second gaussian, in the expressions for Γ, S, replace ¯ǫx, ¯ǫy, ¯ǫs by ¯ǫxb, ¯ǫyb, ¯ǫsb.
In addition. Na + Nb = N. This bi-gaussian has 7 parameters instead of the
three parameters of a gaussian.

6 Growth rates for a Bi- Gaussian distribu-

In the following,the growth rates are given in the Rest Coordinate System,
which is the coordinate system moving along with the bunch. Growth rates
are given for < pipj >. From these one can compute the growth rates for
< ǫi >.Starting with Eq.2 and using the f (x, p) from Eq.18, one gets

In doing the remainder of the integral, the integral over dxdWxdsdWs we
will do the integral over dxdWx ﬁrst and then the integral over dsdWs. Note
that the integral is being done in the Rest CS and in the expression for Sx

Fa, Fb, Fc are each the same F that was deﬁned for the Gaussian distri-

bution except that the ¯ǫi are replaced by ¯ǫia, ¯ǫib, ¯ǫic respectively.

The above results for the growth rates for a bi-gaussian distribution are
expressed as an integral which contains 3 terms, each of which is similar
to the one term in the results for the gaussian distribution. These three
terms may be given a simple interpertation. The ﬁrst term represents the
contribution to the growth rates due to the scattering of the Na particles of
the ﬁrst gaussian from themselves, the seond term the contribution due to
the scattering of the Nb particles of the second gaussian from themselves,
and the third term the contribution due to the scattering of the Na particles
of the ﬁrst gaussian from the Nb partcles of the second gaussian.

7 Emittance growth rates

One can compute growth rates for the average emittances, < ǫi > in the Lab-
oratory Coordinate System, from the growth rates for < pipj > in the Rest
Coordinate System.In the following , dt is the time interval in the Laboratory
System and d˜t is the time interval in the Rest System. dt = γd˜t

To derive the above results, the simplest case to treat is that of the vertical

emittance. The verical emmitance is given by

ǫy(y, y′) = [y2 + (βyy′ + αyy)2]/βy

δǫy = βyδ(y′2)

In Eq.(32), y′ = py/p0, δǫy is the change in ǫy in a scattering event.

For the longitudinal emittance one ﬁnds

In the result for δǫx, the terms that are linear in px or ps have been dropped
as they do not contribute to < δǫx > . In a scattering event involving two
particles , the δpx of one particle is equal and opposite to the δpx of the other
particle. This is also true for ps.

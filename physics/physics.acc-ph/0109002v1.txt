Abstract

We discuss possible acceleration scenarios and methods
for a µ+ − µ− collider. The accelerator must take the
beams from ∼100 MeV to 2 TeV within the muon lifetime
(2.2 × 10−6Eµ/mµ µS), while compressing bunches of
∼1012 muons from m to cm bunch lengths. Linac, recircu-
lating linac, and very rapid-cycling synchrotron approaches
are studied. Multiple recirculating linac approaches are
matched to the muon lifetime and appear readily feasible.
Rapid-cycling approaches require innovations in magnet
designs and layouts, but could be much more affordable.

INTRODUCTION

For a µ+µ− collider [1], muons must be rapidly acceler-
ated to high energies while minimizing the kilometers of
radio frequency (RF) cavities and magnet bores. Cost must
be moderate. Some muons may be lost to decay but not
too many. As the muon energy increases and the bunch
length decreases, higher frequency, higher gradient RF cav-
ities may be used to reduce cost.

2 100 MEV → 2 GEV USING RF = 2 GV

This is the initial acceleration of cooled muons. The bunch
length decreases from 2 m to 20 cm. A single pass 2 GV
linac is used. The RF frequency increases from 10 to 100
MHz from entrance to exit. 93% of the muons survive.

3

2 GEV → 25 GEV USING RF = 2.5 GV

This is the ﬁrst recirculating ring and has 2.5 GV of 100
MHz RF [2]. A superconducting magnet with 10 bores,
each with a different ﬁxed ﬁeld, is used to pass the muons
through a pair of linacs 10 times. The design is similar to
the TJNAF in Virginia. 92% of the muons survive.

4 25 GEV → 250 GEV USING RF = 6 GV

This stage uses a single ring of fast ramping cos θ dipoles
[3]. Thin stranded copper conductor is used at room tem-
perature to achieve a 4 Tesla ﬁeld. The low duty cycle is
exploited to keep the I 2R losses reasonable. 6 GV of 350
MHz RF is distributed around the ring and accelerates the
muons from 25 GeV to 250 GeV in 40 orbits. 85% of the
muons survive.

250 GEV → 2 TEV USING RF = 25 GV

For the ﬁnal stage we consider two 2200 m radius hybrid
rings [4] of ﬁxed superconducting magnets alternating with

iron magnets ramping at 200 Hz and 330 Hz between full
negative and full positive ﬁeld. Muons are given 25 GV
of RF energy (800 MHz) per orbit. The RF is divided into
multiple sections as at LEP, so that magnetic ﬁelds and en-
ergies will match around the rings. The ﬁrst ring has 25%
8T magnets and 75% ±2T magnets and ramps from 0.5T
to 3.5T during 54 orbits. The second has 55% 8T magnets
and 45% ±2T magnets and ramps from 3.5T to 5.3T dur-
ing 32 orbits. The packing fraction is taken as 70% in each
ring. Acceleration is from 250 GeV/c to 2400 GeV/c and
requires a total of 86 orbits in both rings; 82% of the muons
survive.

Consider the power consumption of an iron magnet
which cycles from a full -2T to a full +2T. First calculate
the energy, W , stored in a 2T ﬁeld in a volume 6 m long,
.03 m high, and .08 m wide. µ0 is 4π × 10−7.

Next given 6 turns, an LC circuit capacitor, and a 250
Hz frequency; estimate current, voltage, inductance, and
capacitance. The height, h, of the aperture is .03 m. The
top and bottom coils may be connected as two separate cir-
cuits to halve the switching voltage.

Now calculate the resistive energy loss, which over time
is equal to 1/2 the loss at the maximum current of 8000
Amps. The 1/2 comes from the integral of cosine squared.
A six-turn copper conductor 3 cm thick, 10 cm high, and
7800 cm long has an I 2R power dissipation of 15 kilowatts.

R =

7800 (1.8 µΩ-cm)

= 470 µΩ

(7)

Now calculate the dissipation due to eddy currents in this
conductor, which will consist of transposed strands to re-
duce this loss [5–7]. To get an idea, take the maximum
B-ﬁeld during a cycle to be that generated by a 0.05m ra-
dius conductor carrying 24000 amps. This ignores fringe
ﬁelds from the gap which will make the real answer higher.
The eddy current loss in a rectangular conductor made of
square wires 1/2 mm wide with a perpendicular magnetic
ﬁeld is as follows. The width of the wire is w.

A similar calculation shows that the cooling water tube
losses due to eddy currents can be held to 1200 watts. The
tubes must be made of a high resistivity material such as
316L stainless steel.

Eddy currents must be reduced in the iron not only be-
cause of the increase in power consumption and cooling,
but also because they introduce multipole moments which
destabilize beams. If the laminations are longitudinal, it is
hard to force the magnetic ﬁeld to be parallel to the lami-
nations near the gap. This leads to additional eddy current
gap losses [12]. So consider a magnet with transverse lam-
inations as sketched in Fig. 1 and calculate the eddy current
losses. The yoke is either 0.28 mm thick 3% grain oriented
silicon steel [13] or 0.025 mm thick Metglas 2605SA1 [14,
15]. The pole tips are 0.1 mm thick Supermendur [10] to
increase the ﬁeld in the gap [16].

Similar calculations for the eddy current losses in a Met-
glas yoke and in Supermendur pole tips yield much lower
values, 75 and 210 watts, respectively.

Figure 1: H frame magnet lamination with grain oriented
3% Si–Fe steel. The arrows show both the magnetic ﬁeld
direction and the grain direction of the steel. Multiple
pieces are used to exploit the high permeability and low
hysteresis in the grain direction [17]. If Metglas 2605SA1
is used for the yoke, multiple pieces are not needed, except
for the poles. The pole tips are an iron–cobalt alloy for ﬂux
concentration exceeding 2 Tesla.

R

Eddy currents are not the only losses in the iron. Hys-
H·d B, scale with the coercive force, Hc,
teresis losses,
and increase linearly with frequency. Anomalous loss [9]
which is difﬁcult to calculate theoretically must be in-
cluded. Thus I now use functions ﬁtted to experimen-
tal measurements of 0.28 mm thick 3% grain oriented sili-
con steel [18], 0.025 mm thick Metglas 2605SA1 [14], and
0.1 mm thick Supermendur [18].

In summary, a 250 Hz dipole magnet close to 2 Tesla
looks possible as long as the ﬁeld volume is limited and
one is willing to deal with stranded copper and thin, low
hysteresis laminations. Total losses can be held to twice
the I2R loss in the copper alone, using Metglas.

The 1925 ramping dipoles which are required consume
56 megawatts when running. Given a 15 Hz refresh rate
for the ﬁnal muon storage ring [1], the average duty cycle
for the 250 → 2400 GeV/c acceleration rings is 6%. So the
power falls to 4 megawatts, which is small.

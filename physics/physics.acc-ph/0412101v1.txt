ABSTRACT

The scheme for accurate quantitative treatment of the radiation from a crystalline undulator in presence of
the dechanneling and the photon attenuation is presented. The number of emitted photons and the brilliance
of electromagnetic radiation generated by ultra-relativistic positrons channeling in a crystalline undulator are
calculated for various crystals, positron energies and diﬀerent bending parameters. It is demonstrated that with
the use of high-energy positron beams available at present in modern colliders it is possible to generate the
crystalline undulator radiation with energies from hundreds of keV up to tens of MeV region. The brilliance of
the undulator radiation within this energy range is comparable to that of conventional light sources of the third
generation but for much lower photon energies.

Keywords: crystalline undulator, dechanneling, photon attenuation, brilliance

1. INTRODUCTION

In this paper new results from the theory of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a bunch of ultra-relativistic
positrons channeling through a periodically deformed crystal (a crystalline undulator) are reported. We formulate
the approximation for eﬀective analytical and numerical analysis of the characteristics of the undulator radiation
with account for the inﬂuence of two main parasitic eﬀects, the positron dechanneling and the photon attenuation.
The developed formalism is applied to calculate the number of the emitted photons and the brilliance of the
radiation formed in crystalline undulators.

In a crystalline undulator there appears, in addition to a well-known channeling radiation, the radiation of
an undulator type which is due to the periodic motion of channeling particles which follow the bending of the
crystallographic planes. The parameters of the undulator radiation can be easily varied by changing the energy of
beam particles and the parameters of crystal bending. The feasibility of this scheme was explicitly demonstrated
for in Refs. 1, 2. In these papers as well as in the subsequent publications3–8 the idea of this new type of radiation,
the essential conditions and limitations which must be fulﬁlled to make possible the observation of the eﬀect were
formulated in an adequate form for the ﬁrst time. A number of corresponding numerical results were presented
to illustrate the developed theory. The importance of the ideas suggested and discussed in the cited papers has
also been realized by other authors resulting in a signiﬁcant increase of the number of publications in the ﬁeld
during last years9–17 but, unfortunately, often without proper citation.11–17 A detailed review of the results
obtained in this newly arisen ﬁeld as well as a historical survey of the development of all principal ideas and
related phenomena can be found in Ref. 18.

The mechanism of the photon emission by means of a crystalline undulator is illustrated in Fig. 1. The
(yz)-plane in the ﬁgure is a cross section of an initially linear crystal, and the z-axis represents the cross section
of a midplane of two neighbouring non-deformed crystallographic planes (not drawn in the ﬁgure) spaced by the
interplanar distance d.

Figure 1. Schematic representation of a crystalline undulator. Two black circles denote the nuclei belonging to two
neighbouring crystallographic planes (separated by an interplanar distance d) which are periodically bent. The centerline
of this channel (solid line) is described by a harmonic function y(z) = a sin(2πz/λu). Its period λu and amplitude a satisfy
the condition λu ≫ a. The dashed curve represents the trajectory of a projectile trapped in the channel.

Under certain conditions the ultra-relativistic positrons will channel in the periodically bent channel. The
trajectory of a particle contains two elements. Firstly, there are channeling oscillations due to the action of the
interplanar potential. Their typical frequency Ωch depends on the positron energy ε and the parameters of the
interplanar potential. Secondly, there are oscillations related to the periodicity of the distorted midplane, - the
undulator oscillations, whose frequency is ω0 = 2πc/λu.

The spontaneous emission of photons is associated with both of these oscillations. The typical frequency

the photon ﬂux move in vacuum whereas in the proposed scheme they propagate through a crystalline media.
Therefore, to prove that the crystalline undulator is feasible, it is necessary to analyze the inﬂuence of the
interaction of both beams with the crystal constituents. On the basis of such analysis one can formulate the
conditions which must be met and deﬁne the ranges of parameters (which include ε, a, λu and also the crystal
length Lu and the photon energy ¯hω) within which all the criteria are fulﬁlled. In full this analysis was carried
out very recently and the feasibility of the crystalline undulator was demonstrated in an adequate form for the
ﬁrst time in Refs. 1, 2 and in Refs. 3–8.

For further referencing let us brieﬂy mention the conditions which must be met in a crystalline undulator.

A stable planar channeling of an ultra-relativistic positron in a periodically bent crystal occurs if the maximum
centrifugal force, Fcf , is less than the maximal force due to the interplanar ﬁeld, Fint. Notating the ratio Fcf /Fint
as C one formulates this condition as follows1, 2, 19:

On the contrary, in the limit a

As a result, if one is only interested in the spectral distribution of the undulator radiation, one may disregard the

The term ’undulator’ implies that the number of undulator periods, Nu, is large. Only in this limit does
the radiation formed during the passage of a bunch of relativistic particles through a periodic system bear the
features of undulator radiation (narrow, well-separated peaks in spectral-angular distribution) rather than those
of synchrotron radiation. Hence, the following strong inequality, which entangles the period λu and the length
of a crystal Lu must be met in the crystalline undulator1, 2:

The coherence of the radiation, emitted in the crystalline undulator, takes place if the energy of the channeling
particle does not change noticeably during with the penetration distance. For ultra-relativistic projectiles the
main source of energy losses are the radiative losses. Therefore, it is important to establish the range of energies
for which the parameters of undulator radiation formed in a perfect periodic crystalline structure are stable. In
Ref. 3 a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the radiative loss of energy, ∆ε, due to the channeling and the
undulator radiation was carried out. It was established that the relative radiative losses ∆ε/ε become large if
the initial energy of the positron bunch is ε > 10 Gev. For lower energies of positrons

the radiative losses are small, ∆ε < 0.01ε.

ε < 10 GeV,

As was pointed out Refs. 1, 2, 5–7 two phenomena, the dechanneling eﬀect and the photon attenuation, lead

to severe limitation on the length of a crystalline undulator.

If the dechanneling eﬀect is neglected, one may unrestrictedly increase the intensity of the undulator radiation
by considering larger Nu-values. In reality, random scattering of the channeling particle by the electrons and
nuclei of the crystal leads to a gradual increase of the particle energy associated with the transverse oscillations
in the channel. As a result, the transverse energy at some distance from the entrance point exceeds the depth
of the interplanar potential well, and the particle leaves the channel. The mean penetration distance covered
by a channeling particle is called the dechanneling length. For given crystal and projectile the dechanneling
length Ld = Ld(ε, C) depends on the energy ε and on the parameter C (see (1)). To calculate the dechanneling
length one can either apply the diﬀusion theory to describe the multiple scattering20, 21 or carry out a computer
simulation of the scattering process of the projectile from the crystal constituents.5, 22 Alternatively, to estimate
Ld(ε, C) one can use the approximate formulae.2, 22 For an ultra-relativistic positron the dechanneling length in
(0.05 . . . 0.08) ε (GeV),18
straight channels (i.e. C = 0) in various crystals lies within the interval Ld(ε, 0) (cm)
i.e. does not exceed several millimeters at GeV energies of a positron. For a periodically bent channel the
dechanneling length decreases as C grows following, approximately, the law Ld(ε, C)

The propagation of photons emitted in a crystalline undulator is strongly inﬂuenced by the atomic and the
nuclear photoeﬀects, the coherent and incoherent scattering on electrons and nuclei, the electron-positron pair
production. All these processes lead to the decrease in the intensity of the photon ﬂux as it propagates through
the crystal. A quantitative parameter, which accounts for all these eﬀects and deﬁnes the scale within which the

intensity of a photon ﬂux decreases by a factor of e, is called the attenuation length, La = La(ω). It is related
to the mass attenuation coeﬃcient µ(ω) as La(ω) = 1/µ(ω).23, 24 The coeﬃcients µ(ω) are tabulated for all
elements and for a wide range of photon frequencies.23 The magnitude of La(ω) depends on ω and on the type
of the constituent atoms. For low-Z crystals (e.g., diamond) the magnitude of La(ω) exceeds that for a tungsten
crystal taken for the same ω by a factor of 101 . . . 103. In the case of a diamond crystal the value of La(ω) varies
from 10−2 cm at ¯hω

5 keV up to several cm for ¯hω > 105 eV.

The simplest way to account for the dechanneling and the attenuation is to consider the case when the crystal
length satisﬁes the condition Lu < min [Ld(ε, C), La(ω)], and to assume that within the chosen Lu scale neither
the number of channeled particles nor the ﬂux of emitted photons do decrease. Such approach was utilized in
most of the papers devoted to the crystalline undulator problem. More consistent treatment of the dechanneling
process and of its inﬂuence on the parameters of the undulator radiation was carried out in Refs. 5, 6, where a
simple analytic expression for the spectral-angular distribution was derived which contains, as a parameter, the
dechanneling length.

In the present work we make another step in developing the theory of the crystalline undulator. The following

problems are solved and discussed below in the paper.

(a) We propose the scheme for accurate quantitative treatment of the radiation from a crystalline undulator
in presence of the dechanneling and the photon attenuation (Sect. 3). As a result, we evaluate an analytic
expression for the spectral-angular distribution and the number of emitted photons which contains, as
parameters, three quantities Lu, Ld(ε, C), and La(ω).

(b) We demonstrate that for given type of the crystal and crystallographic plane, and for given values of ε,
a, λu and ω there exists an optimal length of the crystal which ensures the largest number of the emitted
photons.

(c) Using (a) and (b) we carry out the calculation of the number of emitted photons and the brilliance of the
crystalline undulator radiation (Sect. 4). The calculations, which account for the conditions (1)-(4), are
performed for several crystals and by using the parameters of positron bunches used in modern colliders.24

Prior to the discussion of the radiation formed in a crystalline undulator, in Sect. 2 we brieﬂy summarize the
results from the general theory of undulator radiation (see, e.g. Refs. 25–27). We use the term ‘ideal undulator’
to indicate that the propagation of positrons and photons occurs in vacuum.

spectral distribution consists of a set of narrow and equally spaced peaks (harmonics). The peak intensity is

Let us introduce two other quantities which characterize the radiation formed in an undulator and are closely

3. CHARACTERISTICS OF RADIATION FORMED IN A CRYSTALLINE
UNDULATOR

In an ideal undulator the beam of particles and the emitted photons propagate in vacuum.
In a crystalline
undulator, due to the interactions with crystal atoms, the particles can dechannel, and thus be lost for further
motion through the undulator. Additionally, the photons emitted inside the crystal can be absorbed or scattered
while making their way out from the crystal. Therefore, it is necessary to account for the processes of dechanneling
and photon attenuation.
In what follows we carry out the qualitative analysis of the inﬂuence of these two
processes on the characteristics of the radiation formed in a crystalline undulator.

3.1. Spectral-angular distribution in presence of the dechanneling and attenuation

Let the crystal length, the amplitude and period of bending and the energy ε satisfy the conditions (1)-(4).

A positron, which enters the crystal at small incident angle with respect to the curved crystallographic plane,
penetrates through the crystal following the bending of its channel. However, due to random scattering by the
electrons and nuclei of the crystal the energy of the transverse oscillations of the positron in the channel increases,
and ﬁnally the particle leaves the channel, becoming lost for the crystalline undulator. Although the rigorous
treatment of the dechanneling process cannot be implemented by analytical means only, it is possible to develop
a model approach based on the assumption that the probability w(z) for a particle to penetrate at a distance z
along the undulator axis (z

[0, Lu]) can be described by the exponential decay law

∈

In intermediate formulae when referring to the dechanneling length we omit its arguments ε and C.

With the eﬀect of dechanneling taken into account the spectral-angular distribution of the radiated energy

per one particle can be written as follows:

w(z) = exp (

z/Ld) .

where d3E(att)(z)/¯hdω dΩ denotes the spectral-angular distribution from the undulator of the length z. The
superscript ‘(att)’ indicates that to calculate this quantity one has to account for the photon attenuation.

The second term on the right-hand side of (17) is due the process when the projectile channels through the

whole length Lu. Its probability is given by the factor exp (

Lu/Ld). Therefore one can write

(19)

If the photon attenuation is neglected, then to calculate (19) one uses (5) instead of d3E(att)(Lu)/¯hdω dΩ.
The integral in (18) is also evaluated with the help of (5) where one substitutes Nu with z/λu. Such approach
was applied Ref. 5 with the only diﬀerence that in the cited paper to calculate (18) and (19) we used the
discrete probabilities instead of the continuous distribution function (16). The use of the latter implies that the
dechanneling eﬀect is small over the scale of one undulator period and, therefore, Ld ≫

Now let us turn to the derivation of the quantity d3E(att)(z)/¯hdω dΩ which is the spectral-angular distribution
of radiation formed in the undulator of the length z
Lu in presence of the attenuation. In the intermediate
formulae we assume that the ratio Nz = z/λu is an integer number which corresponds to the number of periods
in this undulator. In the ﬁnal formula this limitation will be omitted. Throughout the text the notations Lu
and Nu are reserved for the length of the crystal and the number of undulator periods within Lu.

As mentioned above, if one neglects the photon attenuation eﬀect, the distribution d3E(att)(z)/¯hdω dΩ is
described by (5) where one substitutes Nu with Nz. The only quantity in (5) which depends on the number
of undulator periods is the factor DNz (˜η) deﬁned in (9). This factor appears in the formula for spectral-
angular distribution as a result of squaring the modulus of a coherent sum of the amplitudes of electromagnetic
waves emitted from spatially diﬀerent but similar parts of the undulator. In more detail, DNz (˜η) is given by

case when the ratio z/λu is an integer, its use in the integral from (18) can be justiﬁed by the above mentioned
conditions, that the undulator period λu is small compared to the dechanneling length Ld, the attenuation length,
La, and the length of crystal, Lu. Hence, the relative error, which appears when one uses (21) in (18), is small,
being of the order of magnitude λu/ min

The width of the central peak ∆˜η, which in the case of an ideal undulator equals to 1/Nu, is increased
due to the photon attenuation and the dechanneling. Formally, the additional widths are due to the factors

We use these equations in the subsequent section to deﬁne the optimal length of a crystalline undulator.

3.2. Optimal length of a crystalline undulator

In the case of an ideal undulator one can, in principle, increase inﬁnitely the length of the undulator. This will
result in the increase of the number of photons, the photon ﬂux, and the brilliance since they are proportional
to the number of periods. The limitations on the values of Lu and Nu are mainly of a technological nature.

The situation is diﬀerent for a crystalline undulator, where the number of channeling particles and the number
of photons which can emerge from the crystal decrease with the growth of Lu. It is seen from (32) that if Lu → ∞
then the parameters κd = Lu/Ld and xκd = Lu/La also become inﬁnitely large, and the eﬀective number of
Ld all
periods goes to zero leading to ∆
particles leave the channeling mode and, thus, do not undulate in the most part of the crystal, whereas all
emitted photons are absorbed inside the crystal if Lu ≫
La. Another formal (and physically trivial) fact, which
follows from (31) and (32), is that Neﬀ (x, κd) = 0 also for a zero-length undulator, when Lu = 0. Vanishing of a
positively deﬁned quantity Neﬀ(x, κd) at two extreme boundaries suggests that there exists the length ¯L(x) for
which the eﬀective number of periods (taken for ﬁxed values of La, Ld and λu) attains the maximum.

0. This is quite natural result, since in the limit Lu ≫

Nωn ,

Fn →

To deﬁne the value of ¯L(x) or, what is equivalent, the quantity ¯κd(x) = ¯L(x)/Ld, one carries out the derivative
of f (x, κd) with respect to κd and equalizes it to zero. The analysis of the resulting equation shows that for
each value of x = Ld/La ≥
0 there is only one root ¯κd. Hence, the equation deﬁnes, in an inexplicit form, a
single-valued function ¯κd(x) = ¯L(x)/Ld which ensures the maximum of Neﬀ (x, κd) for given La, Ld and λu.

It is important to note that the crystal length enters Eqs. (29)-(30) only via the ratio κd. All other quantities,
met in these formulae as well as in (31) and (32), are independent on the length of the crystal. Therefore, the
quantity ¯L(x) ensures the highest values of ∆
Fn for the radiation formed in the crystalline undulator.
In this sense ¯L(x) can be called the optimal length of the undulator which corresponds to a given value of x.

The dependences of ¯κd(x) = ¯L(x)/Ld and of the ratio f (x, ¯κd(x)) = Neﬀ(x, ¯κd(x))/Nd on x are presented in
Fig. 3. For a given crystalline structure, the dechanneling length Ld is uniquely deﬁned by the energy ε and the
parameters of bending a and λu. On the other hand, the attenuation length La is the function of ω. Therefore,
ﬁxing ε, a, λu and ω one calculates x = Ld/La and, then, using the dashed curve in the ﬁgure ﬁnds the optimal
length of the crystalline undulator ¯L(x) which accounts for the dechanneling eﬀect and the photon attenuation.
Simultaneously, from the solid curve one ﬁnds the eﬀective number of the undulator periods Neﬀ (x, ¯κd(x)) which
deﬁnes the number of emitted photons, the ﬂux and the brilliance of radiation.

4. NUMERICAL RESULTS

Nωn emitted in a crystalline one has to calculate two
From (29) follows, that to ﬁnd the number of photons ∆
factors. The factor Qn(p) (see (13)) depends on the harmonic number n and on the undulator parameter p
which, in turn, is deﬁned by the values of ε, a and λu through the relation p = 2πγ a/λu. The second factor,
Neﬀ(x, κd) depends on Lu, λu, Ld = Ld(ε, C) and La = La(ω). It was explained in Sect. 3.2 that once the
quantities λu, Ld(ε, C) and La(ω) are known the length of the crystal can be ﬁxed by the condition Lu = ¯L
which results in the maximum values of Neﬀ (x, κd) and
Fn with respect to Lu. The numerical data presented
below in this section was obtained for the optimal length of undulator.

Therefore, to calculate ∆

Nωn one ﬁxes, in addition to the crystallographic plane, the values of n, ε, a and
λu (the three latter are subject to the conditions (1)–(4)) which uniquely deﬁne the quantities p, C, ωn, La(ω).
However, there is some uncertainty with respect to the magnitude of the dechanneling length. This uncertainty is
not intrinsic to the case of a periodically bent crystal but rather reﬂects the stochastic nature of the interaction
of a channeling particle with crystal constituents. As mentioned above to calculate the dechanneling length
one can apply the diﬀusion theory to describe the multiple scattering or carry out numerical simulations of the
scattering process. Alternatively, one can use model-dependent analytic expressions for Ld(ε, C). In the present
paper we utilize the approach, presented in Ref. 2, and approximate Ld(ε, C) with

To calculate the brilliance of a crystalline undulator (which one obtains by using (30) in (15)) it is necessary to
specify the parameters of a positron bunch, which are the current I, the beam sizes σx,y and angular divergencies
φx,y. We used the parameters of the positron beams from several modern high-energy e−e+ colliders. These
parameters are summarized in Table 2. The data on ε, σx,y, l,
and I (which is an average beam current) are
taken from Ref. 24. The beam divergencies φx,y were calculated using the data on the transverse emittance (not
presented in the table) and the beam size σx,y. The peak current I, which is deﬁned as the electric current of a
single bunch, was calculated as I (A)

The results of our calculations are presented in Figs. 4 and 5. The choice of the crystals was motivated by
the fact that C, Si, Ge and W crystals are frequently used in channeling experiments (see, e.g., Ref. 22). An
additional reason is that for a given photon frequency the magnitude of La(ω) rapidly decreases with the growth
of atomic number of the constituent atoms. Therefore, by comparing the results obtained for diﬀerent crystals
one can investigate the inﬂuence of the photon attenuation on the formation of the radiation in a crystalline
undulator.

Graphs ‘(a)’ in Fig. 4 present the dependence of the maximal number of emitted photons of the ﬁrst harmonic
(n = 1) per bandwidth ∆ω1/ω1 and per a positron versus the ratio a/d. The curves were calculated for the
positron energies indicated in Table 2 (for BEPC-II and PEP-II colliders we used the values ε = 2 GeV and ε = 3
Nω1 /BW)max were obtained as
GeV, respectively). For each crystal and for each ε value the dependences (∆
follows. There are two independent variables, λu and a, which, (for ﬁxed crystal, energy and harmonic number n)
deﬁne all other quantities on the right-hand side of (29). For practical purposes it is more convenient to chose the

ratio a/d > 1 and the parameter C < 1 (see Eq. (1)) as the independent variables. Then, for each pair (a/d, C) one
ﬁnds λu, p = 2π γa/λu, Q1(p), the dechanneling length Ld(ε, C) and the number of periods Nd = Ld(ε, C)/λu,
the fundamental harmonic frequency ω1 (see Eq. (10)) and the attenuation length La(ω1), and the value of
Neﬀ(x, ¯κd(x)) which corresponds to the optimal undulator length calculated for x = Ld(ε, C)/La(ω1) (see (31)-
Nω1 /BW. Finally, scanning through all
(32) and Fig. 3 and Sect. 3.2). As a result, one ﬁnds the magnitude of ∆
Nω1/BW)max,
(a/d, C) values one determines the highest possible value of the number of photons per BW, (∆
as a function of a/d. Having done this one also ﬁnds the dependence ω1 = ω1(a/d) (graphs ‘(b)’ in Fig. 4) as
well all other characteristics of the undulator as functions of a/d.

Let us brieﬂy discuss the behaviour of obtained dependences. Firstly, as it is seen from the graphs (a), for
Nω1 /BW)max is an increasing function of a positron energy ε. This feature
a ﬁxed amplitude a the quantity (∆
becomes clear if one analyzes the ε dependence of the product Q1(p) Nd f (x, ¯κd(x)) which deﬁnes the number of
emitted photons (see Eqs. (29) and (31)). All three factors are increasing functions of energy (although it is not
too obvious for f (x, ¯κd(x))).

Another feature of the curves (∆

Nω1/BW)max is that they are decreasing function of a/d in the region
a/d > 1. To a great extent this is a consequence of the photon attenuation in the crystal. Indeed, as the ratio
a/d increases the undulator period λu increases too, in order to maintain the inequality C
1 (see Eq. (1)).
Larger values of λu results in lowering of the emitted photon energy (see Eq. (10) and the graphs (b) in Fig. 4)
and, consequently, to the decrease of the attenuation length, La(ω). This, in turn, leads to the increase of the
ratio x = Ld/La which deﬁnes the magnitude of f (x, ¯κd(x)). This factor, as it is seen from Fig. 3, rapidly falls
Nω1 /BW)max on a/d. In the case of
oﬀ for x > 0.1, and this feature manifests itself in the dependence of (∆
crystals consisting of heavy atoms the dependence acquires additional features, which are due to the fact that
the ionization potentials, I0, of the inner atomic subshells of such atoms lie within the energy range 1 . . . 100
keV. The photons with the energy just above the threshold are absorbed much more eﬃciently than those with
the lower energies. As a result, the dependence of La(ω) in the vicinity of the threshold becomes a saw-like. For

In the opposite limit, when a/d

1 the number of the emitted photons goes to zero. This tendency, which
is seen explicitly for all the curves (but the CERS-C one) in the case of C and Si crystals, is also clear and is due
to the fact that the case a = 0 corresponds to the linear crystal, i.e. the absence of the crystalline undulator.

≪

In Fig. 5 we present the peak brilliance of the crystalline undulators based on diﬀerent crystals (as indicated)
and calculated using the parameters of the positron beams from Table 2. The data refer to the emission in the
ﬁrst and the third harmonics in the forward direction. It is seen that in contrast to the number of the emitted
photons which is the same, by the order of magnitude, for all colliders, the magnitudes of the peak brilliance for
diﬀerent beams diﬀer by orders of magnitude. To the largest extent this is due to the quality of the beam, which
includes, apart from the beam current I, its size and angular divergency, see. Eqs. (14) and (15). For all crystals
and over the whole range of photon energies the product ǫxǫy of the photon source emittances is the smallest for
the KEKB collider (labeled as ‘5’ in the graphs in Fig. 5). As a result, this beam, which does not lead to the
Nω1/BW)max, ensures the largest peak brilliance of the crystalline undulator radiation. The
highest values of (∆
photons/s/mrad2/mm2/0.1%BW
peak brilliance for the KEKB positron beam is on the level of (4 . . . 20)
for the photon energies within 1 . . . 10 MeV range. These values can be compared with the peak brilliance of
(cid:17)
the light sources of the third generation.30 The peak brilliance on the level 1021 . . . 1023 in the 100 keV range
of photon energies by means of the undulators based on the action of magnetic ﬁeld is planned to be achieved
within several projects.31–33 The data from Fig. 5) demonstrate that it is feasible to produce the radiation of
the same level of brilliance but for much higher energies by means of crystalline undulators.

Theoretical investigations show that it is entirely realistic to use a crystalline undulator for generating sponta-
neous radiation in a wide range of photon energies. The parameters of such an undulator, being subject to the
restrictions mentioned in Sect. 1, can be easily tuned by varying the parameters of the bending, the positron

energy and by choosing diﬀerent channels. The large range of energies available in modern colliders together
with the wide range preparation of periodically bent crystalline structures allow one to generate the crystalline
undulator radiation with energies from hundreds of keV up to tens of MeV region. The brilliance of the undulator
radiation within this energy range is comparable to that of conventional light sources of the third generation but
for much lower photon energies.

The experimental eﬀorts are needed for the veriﬁcation of numerous theoretical predictions. Such eﬀorts will
certainly make this ﬁeld of endeavor even more fascinating than as it is already and will possibly lead to the
practical development of a new type of tunable and monochromatic radiation sources.

Figure 4. Graphs (a): the maximal number of photons of the ﬁrst harmonic (n = 1) per a bandwidth ∆ω1/ω1 and
per a positron as a function of the ratio a/d calculated for the positron energies in various colliders (see Table 2) as
indicated. Graphs (b): the corresponding values of the fundamental harmonic energy (see Eq. (10) with n = 1). See
also explanations in the text. Each vertical pair of the graphs (a) and (b) correspond to the positron channeling in the
particular periodically bent channel as indicated in the graphs (a). The legend refers to all graphs in the ﬁgure.

Figure 5. Peak brilliance of the undulator radiation in the forward direction calculated for four channels as indicated in
each graph. The solid curves correspond to the radiation in the fundamental harmonic n = 1, the dashed curves refer to
n = 3. In each graph the enumerated sets of the solid and the dashed curves correspond to the parameters of the positron
beams in diﬀerent colliders (see Table 2). 1: DAΦNE, 2: VEPP-2000, 3: BEPC-II, 4: PEP-II, 5: KEKB, 6: CERS-C.

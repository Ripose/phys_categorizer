Abstract

We show how, beginning with the Fokker–Planck equation for electrons
emitting synchrotron radiation in a storage ring, the corresponding equation
for spin motion can be constructed. This is an equation of the Bloch type for
the polarisation density.

1 Introduction and motivation.

0.924 in a perfectly aligned ﬂat ring without solenoids. This is the so–called Sokolov–
Ternov (ST) eﬀect [1]. The time constant for the exponential build–up is usually in
the range of a few minutes to a few hours and decreases with the ﬁfth power of the
energy.

However real rings can have misalignments, solenoids and spin rotators and this
together with the fact that spins precess in magnetic ﬁelds has important consequences
for the polarisation which we now outline.

transverse to the magnetic ﬁeld, the spin precesses around the ﬁeld at a rate (1 + aγ)
faster than the rate of change of the orbit direction [4, 5]. For electrons at 27.5 GeV
at HERA [6] the spin enhancement factor aγ, is about 62.5.

Synchrotron radiation not only creates polarisation but also produces other eﬀects.
In particular, the stochastic element of photon emission together with accompanying
damping determines the equilibrium phase space density distribution and the beam

can be described by a Fokker–Planck (FP) equation. This is traditionally derived by
simulating the stochastic photon emission with Gaussian white noise [7, 8, 9, 10]. The
same photon emission also imparts a stochastic element to ~Ω and then, via the T-BMT
equation, spin diﬀusion (and thus depolarisation) can occur in the inhomogeneous
ﬁelds of the ring [11, 12, 13]. Thus synchrotron radiation can create polarisation but
can also lead to its destruction! The ratio (depolarisation rate / polarisation rate)
increases with the spin enhancement factor. The equilibrium polarisation is the result
of a balance between the Sokolov-Ternov eﬀect and this radiative depolarisation so
that the attainable polarisation Peq is less than PST. In the approximation that the
orbital motion is linear, the value of the polarisation is essentially the same at each
point in phase space and in s and the polarisation is aligned along the Derbenev-
Kondratenko vector ˆn [14]. The unit vector ﬁeld ˆn depends on s and the position
(x, px, y, py, ∆s, δ = ∆E/E0) [15]. ˆn(~u(s); s) satisﬁes
in phase space deﬁned by ~u
the T-BMT equation along any orbit ~u(s) and it is periodic in azimuth: ˆn(~u; s) =
ˆn(~u; s + C) where C is the ring circumference. On the closed orbit (~u = ~0), ˆn(~u; s) is
denoted by ˆn0(s).

Taking into account radiative depolarisation due to photon-induced longitudinal
recoils, the equilibrium electron polarisation along the ˆn ﬁeld as given by Derbenev
and Kondratenko and by Mane is [14, 16]

The Derbenev–Kondratenko–Mane (DKM) formula is based on the reasonable
and justiﬁable assumption that at spin–orbit equilibrium the polarisation is locally
essentially parallel to ˆn [12]. But it would be more satisfying to have access to a more
basic approach free of assumptions. For example, it would be good to have a kind of
spin–orbit FP equation which would allow non–equilibrium spin–orbit systems to be
studied, and to be able to obtain the DKM result as a special case. An equation of
this type for spin has already been derived by Derbenev and Kondratenko [17] using
semiclassical radiation theory beginning with the density operator for the spin–orbit
system. This equation includes the eﬀects of spin diﬀusion, the ST eﬀect and also
some “cross terms”. At the same time they obtained the FP equation for the orbital
motion with the same form as in [7, 8, 9]. The derivations based on the semiclassical
radiation theory in [17] are very arduous but unavoidable for the ST part of the
picture. However, one is tempted to try to obtain the pure spin diﬀusion part via
the traditional route based on Gaussian white noise in analogy to the description of

2

orbital motion. This would lead to a better appreciation of the results in [17] and to
more insights. We have succeeded in this approach and proceed by developing our
arguments within a purely classical framework in which ~S is treated as a classical
spin vector. We therefore postpone further discussion of the semiclassical calculation
until later.

2 Spin–orbit transport without radiation

In the absence of radiation and other non–Hamiltonian eﬀects and with the orbital
Hamiltonian horb, the orbital phase space density Worb evolves according to an equa-
tion of the Liouville type:

where
We normalise the density to unity:

}~u is the Poisson bracket involving derivatives w.r.t. the components of ~u.
,
d6u Worb(~u; s) = 1.
Since the T–BMT equation is linear in spin, the local polarisation ~Ploc(~u; s), which
is proportional to an average over spin vectors in an inﬁnitesimal packet of phase space
at (~u; s), obeys the T–BMT equation along any orbit ~u(s). If ~Ploc(~u; s) is a smooth
function of (~u; s) we can rewrite this as

3 Spin–orbit transport with radiation

To include radiation we model the photon emission as a Gaussian white noise process
overlaid onto smooth radiation damping. Then eq. (2) is replaced by a FP equation:

LFP,orb Worb ,

where the orbital FP operator can be decomposed into the form:

’s can be found in [7, 8, 9] but are not
important for the argument that follows. After a few damping times Worb approaches
an equilibrium form.

But how can we write the analogue of eq. (4) for polarisation? After all, to obtain
an equation of the FP type we need a density and polarisation is not a density. But we
do have the spin angular momentum density ~

This equation for the polarisation density has the same form as eq. (2) for the phase
space density except for the precession term and since eq. (2) is just the radiationless
version of eq. (4) we can now guess how the extension of eq. (7) to include radiation
will look.

bThe critical energy for synchrotron radiation is usually tens of KeV but the SG energy is many
orders of magnitude smaller [12]. Therefore the inﬂuence of spin motion on the orbital motion
can be neglected. To include the SG forces one replaces the Poisson bracket term in eq. (9) with

This is the extension of eq. (7) to include radiation that we have been seeking and
we see that it is an obvious generalisation of eq. (7). If we switch oﬀ the radiation,
we of course obtain eq. (7) but by introducing W (~u, ~S; s) we avoid the heuristic
derivation of eq. (3). We call eqs. (7) and (11) “Bloch” equations following the
usage for equations of this general form in the nuclear magnetic resonance literature.
Concrete examples of eqs. (4)–(11) for simple exactly solvable models can be found
in [20].

4 Discussion and conclusion

The derivation of the Bloch equation for ~
given here is independent of the source of
P
LFP,orb for a process we can write
noise and damping. In fact as soon as we have the
down the corresponding Bloch equation for ~
. Furthermore, providing that spin is a
P
spectator, this approach can be applied to more general diﬀusion problems where the
operator
LFP,orb is replaced by the appropriate form. For example, a Bloch equation
can be written to describe the eﬀect of intrabeam scattering without spin ﬂip or the
scattering of protons without spin ﬂip oﬀ gas atoms and molecules. Note that the
Bloch equation is valid far from spin–orbit equilibrium and that it is linear in ~
.
P
Moreover, it is universal in the sense that it does not explicitly contain the orbital
density Worb. Surely this is the best place to begin discussions on spin diﬀusion. In the
case of noise and damping due to synchrotron radiation and if the spin–orbit coupling
term in eq. (11) were to vanish (~Ω = ~0), the three components of ~
would each reach
P
equilibrium forms proportional to the equilibrium form for Worb. However ~Ω does not
vanish but instead mixes the components. This is the route, in this picture, by which
~Ω causes depolarisation.

The corresponding evolution equation for the local polarisation ~Ploc can be found
by substituting eq. (6) into eq. (11) and using eq. (4) but the resulting equation
2 and it is not universal since it
is complicated owing to the second derivative in
contains Worb. So to extract ~Ploc one should ﬁrst solve eqs. (4) and (11) separately
and then use eq. (6).

2(ρorb + ~σ

The semiclassical calculation [17] involves writing the density operator in two
~ξ) where ~σ is the spin operator, ρorb is
component spin space as ρ = 1
·
the density operator of the orbital motion and where the operator ~ξ, which encodes
information about the polarisation, is equivalent to ~
. In the quantum mechanical
P
picture, all expectation values involving spin can depend only on ~ξ and diﬀerent mixed
spin states leading to the same ~ξ are equivalent. Correspondingly, the deﬁnition of
~
(~u; s) (eqs. (6) and (8)) involves integration over the spin distribution at (~u; s) so
P
that in principle diﬀerent spin distributions at (~u; s) can lead to the same ~
(~u; s).
P
Thus ~
is not only an economical representation of the spin motion by virtue of its
P
being an average over spin degrees of freedom, but even as a classical entity it also
embodies the eﬀective indistinguishability of equivalent spin distributions.

At zeroth order in ~ and in the absence of radiation the Weyl transform of ~ξ fulﬁlls
eq. (7) as expected [12, 21]. At higher order in ~ SG eﬀects appear. The corresponding
calculation in the presence of radiation [17] delivers terms equivalent to those on the
r.h.s. of eq. (11), which are due to pure spin diﬀusion, together with terms due to the
ST eﬀect which are, not surprisingly, of the Baier–Katkov–Strakhovenko form [22, 23].
There are also the cross terms. So starting with eq. (11) one could, on the basis of
physical intuition, add in the ST terms by hand. But the cross terms can be very
important [12] and they would be missed. So to obtain a complete description of spin
motion a full quantum mechanical, or at least semiclassical, treatment of combined
spin and orbital motion is unavoidable. Our work is a classical reconstruction of
the pure noise and damping part of eq. (2) in [17]. Since the evolution equation for
the orbital phase space density in [17] is the usual FP equation, one sees that the
calculation in [17] provides a physical justiﬁcation for using Gaussian white noise
models for orbital motion. The use of eq. (11) and of eq. (2) in [17] will be described
in a future paper.

It should now be clear that the polarisation density is the most natural polarisation–
like quantity to use in FP–like descriptions of spin motion in accelerator physics.
In fact in retrospect its (three component) equation of motion (eq. (11)) is an intu-
itively obvious generalisation of the (one component) equation for the particle density
(eq. (4)) with an extra term to describe the T–BMT precession of the polarisation
density. Moreover, since the spin degrees of freedom have been integrated out, the
problems of dealing with FP equations containing (spin) variables describing motion
on the sphere and of enforcing periodicity conditions for the spin distribution, are by-
passed. Perhaps some problems in condensed matter physics involving spin diﬀusion
due to ﬂuctuating magnetic ﬁelds could be conveniently handled by simulating the
ﬁeld ﬂuctuations in terms of particle motion in an artiﬁcial “phase space” and then
working with the accompanying artiﬁcial polarisation density.

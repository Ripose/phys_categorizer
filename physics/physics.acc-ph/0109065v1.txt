Abstract

The Relativistic Electron Facility for Education and
Research (REFER) at Hiroshima University accepts a
150 MeV electron beam from a microtron, the injector to
the 700 MeV storage ring of the Hiroshima Synchrotron
Research Center, and keep it circulating for 2.5ms with-
out a RF acceleration. It acts as a beam stretcher and has
been used for the following researches: 1) X-ray genera-
tion from an internal multiple foil crystalline target due to
the parametric X-radiation (PXR) and the resonant transi-
tion radiation (RTR). 2) Laser backward Compton scatter-
ing. 3) Coherent pair creation from Si crystal by 150 MeV
bremsstrahlung. 4) Study of the Ter-Mikaelian effect in the
low energy part of the bremsstrahlung in an extracted elec-
tron line. 5) A novel scheme of beam stabilization by the
induction coil. This paper reports the experimental results
and the current status of the REFER electron ring.

INTRODUCTION

There has been a growing interest in applications of rela-
tivistic electron beam from small devices to industrial [1],
medical [2], and scientiﬁc [3] ﬁelds in recent years.

The REFER electron ring is a compact electron circulat-
ing ring for application research of the relativistic electron
beam and for education of beam physics [4]. The device
was installed at Venture Business Laboratory, Hiroshima
University in 1997. The electron beam energy is 150 MeV,
which is generated by the microtron [5] at Hiroshima Syn-
chrotron Radiation Center [6]. A beam extraction line is at-
tached to the REFER electron ring. The electron beam can
be slowly extracted from the main ring. The electron beam
at the REFER is utilized for investigation and education
of the beam physics, development of new X-ray sources
such as PXR, RTR generation, and Laser backward Comp-
ton scattering, and study of the particle physics such as an
experiment of the coherent pair creation, etc.

Detail of the REFER electron ring is described in the
next section. Section 3 is devoted to the presentation of the
experimental results at the REFER. Last section summa-
rizes the current status of the REFER.

2 REFER ELECTRON RING

The 150 MeV electron beam generated by the microtron at
Hiroshima Synchrotron Radiation Center is injected to the

Aid for Scientiﬁc Research Monbusho No. 06452072.

REFER electron ring. Figure 1 shows the layout of the RE-
FER electron ring. The injection beam has typically 1 µs
in bunch length, peak current upto 10 mA and pulse repeti-
tion rate of 2-100 Hz. Multi-turn injection into the REFER
electron ring is performed by the injection septum mag-
net and the bump magnets. Pulse power generators supply
pulse current to coils of those magnets synchronous with
beam injection timing. The injection septum magnet puts
the beam injected from microtron into the bump orbit. De-
viation of the bump orbit from the reference orbit is varied
from 30 mm to zero with time in 1 µs to avoid collisions of
circulating electrons to the injection septum magnet.

As the present REFER electron ring has no acceleration
mechanism, the energy loss of electron beam, 59.7 eV per
turn, due to synchrotron radiation is not compensated. De-
viation of the electron orbit from the reference orbit in-
creases with time. Therefore, the electrons are lost at vac-
uum pipes after several ten thousands turns. In summary,
the REFER acts as a beam stretcher and has been used for
the several researches described in next section last year.

3 RESEARCH AT REFER

3.1 Parametric X-Radiation

X-radiation generated by electrons passing through sili-
con crystal targets of different thicknesses (49.2, 164.4
and 1644.0 µm) and accurately aligned 10 and 100 layers
of 16.4 µm thick monocrystalline silicon foils was mea-
sured at the REFER [7, 8]. A clear intensity enhance-
ment was observed, when compared to the intensity of PXR
from single crystal targets of equivalent thickness at 14.4
and 28.8 keV. K. Chouffani et al. believed that this en-

Laser Injection Timing [ms]

scattering versus Laser injection timing.

Figure 2: (a) PXR from (011) plane in 164.4 µm silicon
crystal with the amorphous Mo target. (b) Spectrum from
the amorphous Mo target [8].

hancement results from the diffraction of transition radia-
tion from individual surfaces of the foils off the crystallo-
graphic planes [7]. When the molybdenum foil was used
for electron beam normalization, they observed an uniden-
tiﬁed peak at 12.5 keV and its second harmonic. Figure
2 (a) shows PXR spectrum from 164.4 µm silicon single
crystal with the amorphous molybdenum foil. We plan to
investigate the unidentiﬁed peaks using the electron beams
from the REFER extraction line in 2001.

3.2 Laser Compton Scattering

The Laser backward Compton scattering was studied at the
REFER. The wavelength and pulse energy of the Nd:YAG
Laser beam were 532 nm and 550 mJ/pulse, respectively.
Figure 3 shows the counting rate of the Laser backward
Compton scattering. The electron beam shifts to inside di-
rection of the ring and the counting rate changes with the
Laser injection timing. The intensity and energy of the gen-
erated X-ray were about 0.1 photons per bunch and less
than 800 keV, respectively. This is ﬁrst measurement of
the Laser Compton scattering at the REFER and we plan to
measure its spectrum in 2001.

to with the Al target [9].

3.3 Coherent Pair Creation

The coherent pair creation from Si crystal by 150 MeV
bremsstrahlung was measured at the REFER [9]. If a tar-
get is a single crystal, due to the periodicity of the nuclear
potential, the pair cross section has several sudden increase
against non-single crystal. The ratio of the pair cross sec-
tion with the Si target to that with the Al target is shown in
Fig. 4. Y. Okazaki et al. observed a peak at 105 MeV in a
(111) Si crystal to investigate the interference effect among
atomic string. As a result, the statistical quantity was not
sufﬁciency, however, a gentle enhancement was observed
at 105 MeV.

3.4

Study of Ter-Mikaelian Effect

The Ter-Mikaelian effect in the low energy part of the
bremsstrahlung in an extracted electron line has been
studied.
It is well known that the cross section of the
bremsstrahlung from high-energy electron beam with a sin-
gle atom diverges in low energy region. According to Ter-

Mikaelian’s theory, the effects of the multiple scattering
and the polarization cause the reduction of the cross sec-
tion of the bremsstrahlung in a medium. Using the electron
beam with 150MeV energy, which has a negligible effect
of the multiple scattering, T. Ohnishi et al. plan to measure
the polarization effect of the bremsstrahlung.

3.5 Beam Stabilization by Induction Coil

A novel scheme of beam stabilization by the induction coil
is being studied [10]. The electron beam in the REFER
loses its energy by 59.7 eV per turn due to synchrotron ra-
diation. As the REFER has not acceleration instruments,
the beam orbit moves toward the inner wall of the vacuum
pipe. It is about 2.5 ms from the injection to the dumping.
If the energy loss of the beam is compensated by induc-
tion acceleration, the beam can keep circulating for longer
time. S Matsuno et al. designed a small-sized model of an
induction magnet, which has 1/8 cross section of the iron
core to be installed. Combining the software for the current
form and the small-sized model, the magnetic permeability
of the core material was measured to determine the most
suitable form.

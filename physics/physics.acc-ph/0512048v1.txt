At Snowmass2005 the Global Group 6 (Physics Options) considered the requirements and conﬁgurational issues related
to possible alternatives to the baseline e+e− collisions, including γγ, γe, e−e−, GigaZ and ﬁxed target experiments,
and identiﬁed the potential performance parameters.

1. PHOTON COLLIDER

1.1. Introduction

At the photon collider, γγ and γe collisions are obtained by ”conversion” of electrons into high-energy photons
using Compton scattering of laser light at the distance b ∼ γσy ∼ 1–2 mm from the interaction point (IP), Fig. 1.
For the energy 2E0 = 500 GeV, the optimum wavelength (determined by the threshold for e+e− pair creation at
the conversion region) is about 1 µm, which coincides with that of the most powerful lasers available today. The
maximum energy of photons is about 80% of the electron beam energy, so the maximum invariant mass of the γγ
system is about 80% of the c.m.s. beam energy; for γe collisions it is 90%. Lower invariant masses are obtained by
decreasing the electron beam energy. For example, to study the Higgs boson of 120 GeV mass, one needs 2E0=200
GeV. The most comprehensive description of the photon collider available at present that is the TESLA TDR [1];
almost all considerations done for TESLA are valid for the ILC as well.

At the nominal ILC parameters, the expected γγ luminosity in the high-energy peak of the luminosity spectrum
Lγγ ∼ 0.17 Le+e− [2]. However, the γγ luminosity at the ILC is not restricted by collision eﬀects and can be increased
by a factor of 2–3 by reducing emittances in damping rings (which is not easy but possible), reaching Lγγ ∼ (0.3–0.5)
Le+e− . Typical cross sections of many interesting processes in γγ collisions (charged pairs, Higgs, etc) are higher
than those in e+e− collisions by about one order of magnitude, so the number of events in γγ collisions will be larger
than in e+e− even for the nominal beam parameters foreseen for e+e− collisions.

The physics program of the photon collider is very rich and complements in an essential way the physics in e+e−

collisions, independently of the physics scenario. In γγ, γe collisions, compared to e+e−,

• the energy is smaller only by 10–20%;
• the number of interesting events is similar or even larger;
• access to higher particle masses (H,A in γγ, SUSY in γe);
• higher precision for some phenomena;
• diﬀerent types of reactions;
• highly polarized photons.

Figure 1: Scheme of γγ,γe collider

In summary, the physics reach of a γγ, γe collider is not worse than that of a e+e− collider it is based on. The
only advantage of e+e− collisions is the narrower luminosity spectrum, a feature that is of rather limited use. It is
very important to note that the photon collider can be added to the linear e+e− collider nearly for free (the laser
system, modiﬁcation of the IP and one of detector add less than 3–4% of the ILC cost). The decrease of the e+e−
running time by 25–30% is a neglegible price to pay for the opportunity to look for new phenomena in other types
of collisions.

1.2. Special requirements for the ILC

The photon collider presents several special requirements that should be taken into account in the baseline ILC

design:

• For the removal of disrupted beams, the crab-crossing angle at one of the interaction regions should be about
25 mrad (the exact number depends on the quad design); the quad fringe ﬁeld should be small in the region of
the outgoing low-energy beam;

• The γγ luminosity is nearly proportional to the geometric e−e− luminosity, so the product of the horizontal
and vertical emittances should be as small as possible (this translates into requirements on the damping rings
and beam transport lines);

• The ﬁnal-focus system should provide beam spot sizes at the interaction point as small as possible (compared

to the e+e− case, the horizontal β-function should be smaller by one order of magnitude);

• The very wide disrupted beams should be transported to the beam dumps with acceptable losses. The beam
dump should be able to withstand absorption of very narrow photon beam after the Compton scattering;

• The detector design should allow easy replacement of elements in the forward region (<100 mrad);

• Space for the laser and laser beam lines has to be reserved.

1.3. Crossing angle

.
After passing the conversion and collision points, the electrons have energy from about 5 GeV up to E0 and
the horizontal disruption angle up to about 10 mrad, see Fig.2 (due to limited statistics in simulation, about 105
macroparticles, the maximum angles should be multiplied by a factor of 1.2 [1]). Above this angle, the total energy

Figure 2: Angles of disrupted electrons after Compton scattering and interaction with opposing electron beam; N = 2 × 1010,
σz = 0.3 mm.

of particles is less than that in the secondary irremovable e+e− background.

For removal of these disrupted beams one needs the crab-crossing angle to be larger than the disruption angle plus
the angular size of the ﬁnal quad, see Fig. 1. Thare is an additional requirement: the ﬁeld outside the quad (in the
region of the disrupted beam) should be small in order to add a small deﬂection angle for low-energy particles.

Possible quad designs for the photon collider were considered at Snowmass2005 by B. Parker. In his initial design,
the ﬁeld outside the superconducting quad was shielded by an active superconducting screen (winding) around the
disrupted beam [3]. This solution is possible but rather diﬃcult, and compensation is not suﬃcient. At the workshop,
B. Parker produced another, much more attractive quad design, which gives a minimum crossing angle, see Fig. 3.
In short, the quad consists of two quads of diﬀerent radis, one inside another, with opposite ﬁeld directions. In this
design the gradient on the axis is reduced only by 15%, the ﬁeld outside the quad is practically zero, so no additional
shielding is required.

The radius of the quad, the cryostat taken into account, is R = 5 cm. For the horizontal disruption angle of 11
mrad (with about 20% margin) the minimum crab-crossing angle is 23–27 mrad for the distance of the quad from
the IP L∗ =4.5–3.5 m, respectively. Obtaining the ﬁnal numbers requires some additional checks, but roughly it is
25 mrad. RElative positions of the quad, the outgoing electron beam and the laser beam at the distance 4 m from
the IP is shown in Fig. 4

Several important remarks concerning the crossing angle:

• In considering the required crab-crossing angle we assumed that the bunch length σz = 0.3 mm. This gives
αc = 25 mrad. At present, the bunch length σz = 0.15 mm is also considered for e+e− collisions. The disruption

angle for low energy particles is proportional to pN/σz and depends very weakly on transverse beam sizes.
This means that for σz = 0.15 mm the disruption angle is about 14–15 mrad and the required crab-crossing
angle 30 mrad. So, shorting of the bunch length is not desirable for the photon collider.

• In evaluating the disruption angles, we assume that the thickness of the laser “target” is equal to one scattering
length for electrons with initial energy (65% of electrons scatters). Further increase of the conversion probability
leads to lowering the electron energies due to multiple scattering and, correspondingly, to increasing disruption
angles.

• We assumed that the laser wavelength is λ = 1 µm for all ILC energies. Due to pair creation in the conversion
region, at the energy 2E0 >700–800 GeV it is desirable that a longer laser wavelength be used. The disruption

4

angles in this case will be smaller.

• For low-energy operation, say E0 = 100 GeV, one can consider the possibility of using a shorter laser wavelength
(doubled of triplet frequencies) in order to increase the energy of backscattered photons and improve the shape
of the spectrum. However, this would lead to increasing disruption angles. Fixing αc = 25 mrad, we close the
possibility of shortening the laser wavelength. For physics this is acceptable, lower parameters x = 4E0ω/mc2
even have some advantages for the Higgs study.

• Due to the detector ﬁeld e−e− beams collide at a non-zero vertical collision angle which is several times larger
than σy/σz, Fig.5. This angle can be removed by dipole correction winding in quads [4]. Such a correction
shifts the IP vertically by about 300 µm, which is acceptable.

the e−e− collision angle is made zero using shifted quads.

• The solenoid ﬁeld gives an additional deﬂection angle to the disrupted beam. The vertical deﬂection for lowest-
energy particles (5 GeV) by the solenoid ﬁeld is about 5 mrad, which adds to the 10–12 mrad acquired during
the beam-beam collisions, so the total vertical angle is about 17 mrad. The solenoid ﬁeld also leads to some
horizontal displacement of the disrupted beam (due to vertical motion of particles) but it is smaller than the
vertical shift of the beam. Figure 6 shows the inﬂuence of the detector ﬁeld on the disrupted beam. These
ﬁgures correspond to head-on collisions at the photon collider with beam energies 2E0 = 200 and 500 GeV. For
beams with an initial mutual shift at the IP, the central core is shifted due to the instability of collisions but
the maximum angles are practically do not change and decrease for large beams shifts.

• Synchrotron radiation (SR) in the detector ﬁeld leads to an increase of the vertical beam size. This eﬀect was
considered in Refs. [2, 4]. Detector ﬁelds used in simulations are shown in Fig. 7. Results of the simulation
are presented in Table 1.3; the statistical accuracy is about ±0.5%. We see that at the crossing angle of 25
mrad the decrease of the e+e− luminosity due to the SR is 5, 1.5 and 2 % for LDC, SiD and GLD detectors,
respectively. It is possible that possibly that by proper shaping of the ﬁeld in the LDC the eﬀect can be reduced
further.

GeV, right: 2E0 = 500 GeV. The total number of macroparticles in the beam (several collisions) is about 150000. Taking into
account the tails, which can cause backgrounds, the “eﬀective” beam sizes are larger by about 20%.

So, the crab-crossing angle needed for the photon collider is about 25 mrad, which is, in principle, compatible with
e+e−. For e+e− experiments, a smaller angle is preferable, so the angles 2, 14, 20 mrad are considered. Additional
considerations important for the IR design choice are the following: a) it is desirable to have the same beam dump
for e+e− and γγ modes (for the same IR), b) the beam line from the detector to the beam dump for e+e− should be
curved in order to reduce background from the beam dump to the detector. Three possible conﬁgurations are shown
in Fig. 8:

1. In the ﬁrst scheme, the crossing angle is 25 mrad both for γγ and e+e−. Only the pathways to the beam dumps

are diﬀerent for e+e− and γγ.

2. In the second conﬁguration, the crossing angle is 25 mrad for γγ and 20 mrad (or even somewhat less) for e+e−.
The detector and beam dump are in the same place for all modes of collisions, but the beamlines upstream of

the detector (the ﬁnal focus system) are at diﬀerent places.

3. In the third scheme, the crossing angle is 25 mrad for γγ and 20 mrad (or even somewhat less) for e+e−.
Transition from e+e− to γγ operation needs the displacement of the detector and a shift of the ﬁnal-focus
system.

The ﬁrst scheme is the easiest and needs no displacements, but the crossing angle may be somewhat larger than
necessary for e+e−. The schemes 2 and 3 allow angles smaller than 25 mrad for e+e− operation. Though the third
scheme needs the displacement of the detector of about O(1–3) m (depends on the length of the straight chromatic
correction section at the end of the ﬁnal focus system; here it is assumed to be equal to about 500 m [9]), it looks
more attractive than the second scheme because it needs smaller total bending angles of beamlines upstream of the
detector and therefore requires a smaller bending length (which is determined by the emittance dilution; for the ﬁxed
dilution of the normalize emitance L ∝ E3/2α5/4
). The curved e+e− beamline to beam dump is also easier in the
third scheme due to smaller total bending angle.

b

So, the third scheme can be recommended for the baseline conﬁguration and needs optimization by the beam
It seems OK for 25 mrad for γγ and 20 mrad for e+e−. The decrease of the
delivery working group (WG4).
e+e− crossing angle down to 14 mrad is more problematic, transition from 14 to 25 mrad, certainly, requires more
longitudinal and transverse space.

At the moment WG4 plans to bend the beams to the interaction points at the distance about 2000 m from the IP.
This length includes also the collimation system. It makes a problem even for transition from 20→25 mrad because
too wide tunnel is needed. Though it is not clear for me why the 2.5 mrad bend can not be done after the collimation
system at the distance about 500 m from the IP (as it was assumed above).

1.4. The γγ luminosity

The γγ luminosity for ILC energies is determined by the geometric luminosity of electron beams [1, 5, 6]. As has
already been mentioned in the Introduction, for the nominal ILC beam parameters the expected γγ luminosity in
the high-energy peak of the luminosity spectrum Lγγ ∼ 0.17Le+e−. However, there is hope to increase it by a factor
of 2–3. There is a general rule: Lγγ ∼ 0.1Lgeom.

So, one needs the smallest beam emittances and beta-functions at the IP, approaching the bunch length. Compared
to the e+e− case, where the minimum transverse beam sizes are determined by beamstrahlung and beam instability,
the photon collider needs a smaller product of horizontal and vertical emittances and smaller horizontal beta-function.
However, there are some problems.

The existing ﬁnal-focus scheme has chromo-geometric aberrations that limit the eﬀective horizontal beta-function
at about 5 mm (for the nominal horizontal emittance), Fig. 9 [7]. For a horizontal emittance four times lower,
the minimum βx is 2.2 mm, which increases the γγ luminosity by a factor of 3. So, lower horizontal emittance is
very desirable for two reasons. Present minimum emittances in damping rings originate from requirements for e+e−

collisions, but not from physics limitations in the damping rings (DR). If we reduce the horizontal emittance by a
factor of 2 and the vertical emittance by 30%, βx can be reduced from 5 to 3.7 mm which results in an increase of
the γγ luminosity by a factor of 2. A decrease of the horizontal emittance by a factor of 4 and by 30% the vertical
one allows an increase of the luminosity by a factor of 3.5! In this case, the high-energy γγ luminosity will reach
almost 60% of e+e− luminosity, and the number of events will be greater by about a factor of 5. This certainly is a
very good goal.

From A. Wolski’s talk at Snowmass [8] it follows that, in principle, such a decrease of emittances in DR is possible
by adding wigglers in order to reduce the damping time and thus to suppress intra-beam scattering. It is necessary
to study these possibilities in detail. Clearly, such a reduction of emittances will increase the DR cost, but by how
much? Such a reduction of emittances would be useful for e+e− as well, but for γγ it means a considerable increase
of the luminosity (which is time and money).

1.5. Beam dump

positrons);

The photon collider needs a special beam dump, very diﬀerent from e+e−. There are two main diﬀerences:

• Disrupted beams at the photon collider is an equal mixture of electrons and photons (and some admixture of

• Disrupted beams at the photon collider are very wide (see Fig. 10), and need exit pipes with a large diameter.

• On the other hand, the photon beam after the Compton scattering is very narrow. At the distance of 250 m
from the IP, the r.m.s. transverse size of the photon beam is 1 × 0.35 mm2, see (see Fig. 11), with the power
of about 10 MW. It cannot be dumped directly in a solid or liquid material.

There is an idea of such a beam dump and corresponding simulations [10], but the next step required a more careful
study. The idea is the following. The water beam dump is situated at the distance about 250 m from IP, Fig. 12.
The electron beam can be swept by the fast magnets (as in the TESLA TDR) and its density at the beam dump

will be acceptable. In order to spread the photon beam we suggest to put a gas target, for example Ar at P ∼ 4
atm, somewhere between the distance of 120 and 250 m: photons would produce showers, the beam diameter would

10

increase and the density at the beam dump would become acceptable. In order to decrease the neutron ﬂux in the
detector one can add a volume with a gas hydrogen gas just before the Ar target, which would reduce the ﬂux of
backward-scattered neutrons at the IP at least by one order of magnitude. The corresponding numbers can be found
in Ref. [10].

In order to reduce the diameter of the beamline between the beam dump and the IP, it is desirable to focus
somewhat the disrupted electron (positron) beam just after the exit from the detector (this issue has not been
considered yet). The angular distribution of beamstrahlung photons is similar to that of beamstrahlung electrons
that produced these photons. However, the energy of beamstrahlung photons produced by rather low-energy large-
angle electrons is only a small fraction of their energy, so the eﬀective (energy-weighted) angular distribution of
photons is narrower than that for electrons. According to Fig. 10 (right), for photons the clear angle ±3 mrad will
be suﬃcient, which is 75 cm at the distance of 250 m.

The Ar target should have the diameter of no more than 10 cm (a shower of such diameter does not present a
problem). The rest of the volume of the exit pipe with a diameter of about 1.5 m can be ﬁlled with air at 1 atm
(or vacuum). Such measures are necessary in order to avoid unnecessary scattering of low-energy electrons traveling
at large distances from the axis and thus to reduce the energy losses and activation of materials (water, air) in the
unshielded area (it is diﬃcult to shield a 100 m tube).

1.6. Laser system

The required laser parameters:

• Wavelength

∼ 1 µm (good for 2E0 < 700 GeV);

• Time structure

c∆t ∼ 100 m, 3000 bunches/train;

• Flash energy

∼ 9 J (about one scattering length for E0 = 250 GeV);

• Pulse length

σt ∼ 1.5 ps.

The most attractive scheme for a photon collider with the TESLA/ILC pulse structure is storage and recirculation
of a very powerful laser bunch in an external optical cavity [1, 5, 6, 11, 12]. This can reduce the required laser power
by a factor of ∼100 (the quality factor of the cavity).

Dependence of the γγ luminosity on the ﬂash energy and f# = F/2R (ﬂat-top laser beam) for several values of the
parameter ξ2 (which characterizes multi-photon eﬀects in Compton scattering, ξ2 < 0.3 is acceptable [1]) is presented
in Fig. 13 [2]. This simulation is based on the formula for the ﬁeld distribution near the laser focus for ﬂat-top laser
beams. It was assumed that αc = 25 mrad and the angle between the horizontal plain and the edge of the laser beam
is 17 mrad (the space required for disrupted beams and quads, see Fig. 4). At the optimum, f# ∼ 17, or the angular
size of the laser system is about ±0.5/f# ≈ ±30 mrad. If the focusing mirror is situated outside the detector at the
distance of 15 m from the IP, it should have a diameter of about 1 m. All other mirrors in the ring cavity can have
smaller diameters, about 20 cm is suﬃcient from the damage point of view (diﬀraction losses require an additional
check).

The DESY-Zeuthen group has considered an optical cavity at the wave level, its pumping by short laser pulses,
diﬀraction losses, etc. [12]. The scheme of their cavity is shown in Fig. 14. In this study, truncated Gaussian beams
were used. The results are in agreement with those given above for ﬂat-top laser beams. Of course, consideration
at the wave level is much more informative as it allows simulation of diﬀraction losses and propagation of diﬀerent
laser modes in the cavity. A possible layout of the cavity in the detector hall is shown in Fig. 15. In this design, the
laser is situated on the surface; it may be better to hide the cavity under the detector.

This study of the cavity is only the ﬁrst step. Now we need a more detailed considerations of all technical aspects
of such a cavity and pumping laser with participation of people who are experienced in this ﬁeld and are experts
in laser technologies. As the result of the next step, we should understand what is well established and does not
need an additional proofe and what needs additional experimental checks. Participation of recognized laser experts

in these developments and their critical expertise will be suﬃcient for convincing the ILC community and politicians
in the feasibility of the photon collider, but before construction of the real laser system we certainly need to organize
the experimental laser group and construct a prototype in order to get experience and make the ﬁnal design more
reliable. There are some plans of such a facility at ATF2 at KEK [13]. Similar, but less powerful, laser cavities are
also developed for beam diagnostic at the ILC and for the laser positron source.

Though the cavity reduces substantially the required laser energy, the laser should still be very powerful. All
technologies necessary for such a laser exist, namely: the chirped pulse technique, adaptive optics, diode pumping,
etc. According to LLNL estimation, the cost of one such laser is about $ 10 M [14]. The photon collider needs two
such lasers and one–two spares.

Figure 15: Layout of the cavity in the detector hall [12].

The same laser with the 1 µm wavelength can be used up to the ILC energy 2E0 ∼ 700 GeV. At higher energies,
the γγ luminosity decreases due to e+e− pair creation in the conversion region in collision of the high-energy and
laser photons [23, 24] and due to the decrease of the Compton cross section, see Fig. 16. For the energy 2E0 = 1
TeV, the reduction of the luminosity due to this eﬀect is about a factor of 2–3 compared to the optimum case. For
the high energies it is desirable to have a wavelength of about 1.5–2 µm. The technical feasibility of such a laser has
not been studied yet.

1.7. Summary on the photon collider. The next steps.

A crab crossing angle of 25 mrad is the minimum crossing angle compatible with the photon collider. It is acceptable
for e+e− operation as well, since the decrease of Le+e− is small. However, the e+e− people prefer smaller angles

13

in order to somewhat increase the detection eﬃciency for several processes (detection of small angles is needed for
suppresion of some background processes). If the ILC is optimized only for e+e−, then the photon collider is not
possible at all. On the other hand, the angle of 20 mrad is considered as one of possibilities for e+e−, which is very
close to 25 mrad. In order to facilitate a transition to the photon collider the best would be the choice of the same
angle for e+e− and γγ,γe, i.e. 25 mrad. As alternative one can use the scheme 3 in Fig. 8 which requires displacement
of the detector and the ﬁnal focus system.

In order to ﬁx the crossing angle a optimize L∗, a more detailed simulation of beam losses is required, as well as a

more detailed design of the quad (which already seems good).

In order to increase Lγγ it is desirable to decrease emittances in the DRs.
It is necessary to develop the ﬁnal focus system for the photon collider with a small βx and understand whether

it is compatible with e+e− or needs diﬀerent hardware.

There exist ideas for the photon collider beam dump, detailed consideration is necessary.
There are some studies of the laser optical cavity for the photon collider, the next steps is consideration of all

technological aspects, which requires participation of laser experts (needs money).

At the photon collider, the angle of about ±100 mrad is occupied by laser beams; this should be taken into account

in the design of one of the detectors.

A decision about the status of the photon collider in ILC project should be made expediciuosly, because a) the
photon collider determines design of many ILC elements; b) people will join to the development of the photon collider
only if it is a part of the ILC and has political and ﬁnancial support.

2. ELECTRON-ELECTRON COLLIDER

Electron-electron collider presents a very unique possibility for study of many phenomena at the ILC under very
clean conditions (without background from annihilation processes). Physics in e−e− collisions was discussed at
several e−e− workshops (organized by C .Heusch) and proceedings are published [15]. Such type of collisions requires
minimum modiﬁcation of the ILC, mainly in the ﬁnal-focus system; nevertheless, this requires attention of accelerator
people. Due to the beam repulsion, the attainable luminosity is by a factor of 5 lower than in e+e− collisions. At
Snowmass, P.Bambade [16] discussed the possibility of e−e− in the scheme with a 2 mrad collision angle (where quads
deﬂect outgoing beams). It was shown that the e+e− ﬁnal focus system can be readjusted to e−e− in the case of
more-round than optimal beams, with an additional loss in the luminosity by a factor of 2 and larger beamstrahlung.
More studies are needed.

In summary: this option is important, and though seems simple technically (change of the magnet polarity), in

reality its realization needs careful consideration of all accelerator parts, and solutions are not always simple.

3. GIGA-Z

Physics requirements for GigaZ were considered at Snowmass by K. M¨onig [17]. Only one remark here. GigaZ
needs polarized beams with a small energy spread. The scheme with an undulator at E ≈ 150 GeV and further
deceleration gives a large energy spread, so a bypass is needed. Eﬀects of the wakeﬁeld in the main linac in GigaZ
operation was considered at Snowmass by K. Kubo [18]. Undulator positron source in the GigaZ option was discussed
by D. Scott [19].

4. FIXED TARGET EXPERIMENTS

Fixed target experiments are traditional in particle physics and should be not ignored at the ILC [20–22]. For this
purpose one can use the spent electron beam after the IP and deﬂect it from the beam dump to the experimental

14

area. It consists of clean-up slits, a target area for production of the photon beam using crystal or laser targets,
divergent tunnel, experimental hall and ﬁnal dump. All together occupy more than one km in length, Fig. 17 [20]. In
order to reduce overlapping of events, it is attractive to consider the possibility of ﬁlling the ILC train by low-charge
bunches between the primary ILC bunches and to deﬂect them by kickers for ﬁxed target experiments.

If this option is accepted, it considerably inﬂuences the design of the ILC interaction region.

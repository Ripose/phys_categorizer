Identifying high power breakdowns in accelerating
structures with acoustic sensors

Nicolas Delerue
GLC Group, KEK
Talk given at the 9th Accelerator and Particle Physics Institute

APPI (Japan), February 2004

To increase the energy of Particle Accelarators to reach the requirements of
the Linear Collider or of the Super KEK-B factory, new accelerating
structures with a higher accelerating gradient need to be developped. These
accelerating structures are often aﬀected by high power breakdowns.
Knowing the exact location where these breakdowns occured helps to
redesign the structure and improve its performances.
This can be done with acoustic sensors.

1 Accelerating strucures

RF Power

Transmitted Power

R&D

Accelerating structure are used in (mainly
in LINACs) to accelerates particles. Usu-
ally a very high frequency (Radiofrequency)
electromagnetic pulse is feed into the struc-
ture. This electromagnetic pulse will cre-
ate, in the structure, an accelerating gradi-
ent that will accelerate the particles beam
(see ﬁgure 1).

At KEK-B the typical power feed into
a structure is 40 MW at 3 GHz (S-band)
whereas the structure that should be used
in the Linear Collider [1] (if warm technol-
ogy is chosen) will be feed with 75 MW at a
frequency of 11 GHz (X-band). A picture of
an X-band accelerating structure is shown

Accelerating gradient

Figure 1: Scheme of an accelerating struc-
ture. The electromagnetic wave (red ar-
rows) is inserted at the left of the structure
and travels to the right, thus creating an ac-
celerating gradient that will accelerate the
particles beam. At the end of the structure
the transmitted power is extracted and can
be measured.

on ﬁgure 2.

1.1 High power breakdowns

As the accelerating gradient depends to
the power that was feed into the structure,
to increase the accelerating gradient (and
reach higher energies) one needs to increase
the power of the pulse.

When the energy concentrated on a given
point of the structure becomes too high a
spark will occur. This can happen at a loca-
tion where, by design, the energy density is
very high, like for example the input coupler
of the structure (see ﬁgure 3 top) but this
can also happen at a location where there
is an impurity at the surface of the metal
forming the structure (see ﬁgure 3 bottom).

Transmitted pwr

For example, for the upgrade of KEK-
B, a higher accelerating gradient is needed
as this will allow to reach a higher lumi-
nosity. Thus the current S-band accelerat-
ing structures will be replaced by C-band
(6 MHz) accelerating structures operating
with a higher power input (More details
on the KEK-B upgrade and the C-band
structures R&D can be found in Sugimura
Takeshi’s contribution to this APPI work-
shop).

For the Linear Collider the required en-
ergy makes it necessary to use X-band
structures. Such structures have never been
used in an accelerator before before and
thus their design is new.

Figure 3: Breakdowns in an accelerating
structure. Breakdowns can occur either at
the input or output of the structure (top
ﬁgure) or somewhere else in the structure,
for example near an impurity at the sur-
face of the structure (bottom ﬁgure). The
timing with which power will be transmit-
ted and reﬂected depends on the location of
the breakdown.

A proper identiﬁcation of the location
where the breakdowns occur helps to re-
design (in future structures) the location
where the power concentrate.

1.2 Breakdowns identiﬁcation

There are several diﬀerent methods to lo-
cate where a breakdown occured.

2 Breakdowns

studies
for the C-Band struc-
tures

• As shown on ﬁgure 3 when the break-
down occurs the incoming electromag-
netic wave is reﬂected back to the in-
put of the structure. If the breakdown
occurs in the middle of the electro-
magnetic wave, then part of the wave
will be reﬂected whereas the part that
had already passed the location of the
breakdown will be transmitted. Thus
by measuring the shape of the reﬂected
and trasmitted waves, it is possible to
deduce the location and the time (with
respect to the begining of the wave)
at which the breakdown occured. As
the electromagnetic wave is often de-
formed, this method has a limited pre-
cision.

• When the breakdown occurs, noise is
produced. By placing accoustic sen-
sors (microphones) near the structure
it is possible detect this noise.
If the
accoustic sensors are located regularly
along the structure it is possible to
identify which sensor received the sig-
nal ﬁrst and thus near which sensor the
breakdown occured.

• The breakdowns also produces X-rays
that can be detected with convention-
nal X-Ray detectors.

• Other methods are exist but are often
more expensive or less easy to use than
the one mentionned above.

The C-band accelerating structure R&D
done at KEK aims to have a suitable
structure design for the KEK-B upgrade.
This work is conducted by the KEK Linac
Upgrade group conducted by Kamitani
Takuya (More details on this work can be
found in Sugimura Takashi’s presentation[2]
during this workshop).

There is one accelerating structure cur-
rently tested at the KEK main Linac.
It
has been equipped with 4 acoustic sensors,
to which 4 extra sensors where added later
as shown on ﬁgures 4, 5 and 6. Addi-
tionaly after each breakdown informations
about the RF wave are stored and available
for analysis.

can be seen on top of the structure.

2.1 Acoustic data

On ﬁgure 7 one can see an example of break-
down as recorded by the acoustic sensors.
The signal is huge and thus easily distin-
guishable from the background noise. But
extracting the breakdown location from this
signal is not so easy. One could decide that
the sensor the closest from the breakdown
will receive the signal earlier (the travel
path is shorter) or the more intense (the
attenuation should be smaller).

Unfortunately on some events such as the
one shown on ﬁgure 8 the sensor receiving
the signal ﬁrst is not the one that receives
the most intense signal. Furthermore the
order in which the sensors receive the sig-
nal will not always have a physical interpre-
tation. Thus a double algorithm has been
used to locate the breakdown: one is based
on the time at which each sensor has re-
ceived the signal and the other one is based
on the intensity of the signal. Attempts to
use either intensity or timing information to
locate the breakdown between two sensors
have not been successful.

top of the C-band structure tested at KEK’s
main Linac.

Figure 9: Analysis of the breakdowns recorded with the acoustic sensors. The upper
left plot shows for each sensor the number of breakdowns where this sensor received the
noise ﬁrst. The upper right plot shows for each sensor the number of breakdowns where
this sensor received the most intense signal. The lower left plot shows the correlation
between the two upper plots, the horizontal axis corresponding to the sensor that received
the noise ﬁrst and the vertical axis to the sensor that received the most intense signal.
The lower right plot shows for each sensor the number of breakdowns where this sensor
received the signal ﬁrst and also received the most intense signal.

The number of breakdowns recorded by
each sensor can be seen on ﬁgure 9. The
upper left plot shows the number of break-
downs that have reached a sensor ﬁrst, the
upper right shos the number of breakdons
that were the most intense for a given sen-

sor. The lower left plot shows the correla-
tions between the to upper plots and the
lower right plots shows when the number of
breakdowns when timing and intensity in-
formation agree (golden events).

From this ﬁgure one can see that the
breakdowns occur in the forward region of
the structure as sensor 2 to 4 record the
most intense signal. By looking at the
golden events one can see that these events
seems to be located inside the structure
rather than at its edge as it is sensor 4 that
records the more golden events.

Figure 10: Example of RF data recorded
during a breakdown. The red line corre-
sponds to the incoming RF wave, the green
line to the reﬂected RF wave, the blue line
to the outgoing wave and the yellow line to
the reﬂected wave at the klystron..

The analysis of the electromagnetic waves
is more straightforward. The ﬁgure 10
shows an example of electromagnetic wave
measurement during an event where a
breakdown occured. The diﬀerence be-
tween the time at which the outgoing wave
(in blue) ﬁnishes and the time at which the
reﬂected wave (in green) reaches the input
of the structure provides information on the
location of the breakdown:
if the break-
down occured close from the output of the
structure the outgoing wave will have to

6

travel a much shorter distance than the re-
ﬂected wave, thus the time diﬀerence be-
tween the two will be negative. On the
other hand, if the breakdown occurs near
the input coupler the reﬂected wave will
have a short travel distance whereas the
outgoing wave will have to travel a much
longer path, thus the diﬀerence will be pos-
itive.

The comparison between the length of
the incoming electromagnetic wave and the
length of the outgoing wave gives the time
at which the breakdown occured.

To measure the resolution of this analy-
sis, it is possible to look at the diﬀerence
between the time at which the incoming
wave is recorded and the time at which the
outgoing wave is recorded. This diﬀerence
corresponds to the time an electromagnetic
wave needs to travel the length of the struc-
ture and should be constant. The distrib-
tion of this variable gives the resolution of
the other variables.

The analysis of the electromagnetic waves
information is shown on ﬁgure 11. From
this analysis one can see that there is no
speciﬁc time at which the breakdown occurs
but that almost all breakdowns occur near
the input coupler.

2.3 Correlations between elec-
tromagnetic and RF wave
data

The correlation between the information
collected with the acoustic sensors and the
electromagnetic waves analysis has been
studied. This correlation can be seen on
ﬁgure 12.

3 Breakdowns

studies
for the X-Band struc-
tures

The X-band accelerating structure R&D
done at KEK is part of the worldwide eﬀort
to build a X-band Linear Collider (GLC,
Global Linear Collier) able to reach a cen-
ter of mass energy of 1 TeV. This work is
conducted at the GLCTA (GLC Test Ac-
celerator) headed by Higo Toshiyasu.

A new test stand has recently been in-
stalled at the GLCTA and was under com-
misionning until March 2004. Thus acous-
tic sensors were used to detect breakdowns
occuring in the waveguide and not in the
structure itself. The acoustic sensors used
at the GLCTA are read by VME modules.
The sensors and the modules have been pro-
vided by SLAC where a similar system is
already in use[3].

In a ﬁrst step only 16 sensors have been
deployed but in a later step up to 400 sen-
sors will be installed on the structure once
the test stand will be fully commissionned.
The VME data acquisition software and
the data analysis software have both been
written at KEK.

A usual glue was used to stick the acous-
tic sensors on the waveguides at the loca-
tion know to be the most likely to produce
breakdowns. Acoustic sensors glued on the
waveguides can be seen on ﬁgures 13 and 14.

3.1 Acoustic data analysis

The ﬁgure 15 page 11 (top) shows a typical
event as recorded by the acoustic sensors at

Figure 13: A waveguide of the X-band test
stand equipped with acoustic sensors.

Figure 14: A piece of waveguide of the X-
band test stand with an acoustic sensor.

The statistical repartition of the break-
downs following this classiﬁcation can be
seen on ﬁgures 16 and 17.

These two ﬁgures correspond to diﬀerent
conﬁguration of the acoustic sensors. Fig-
ure 16 uses data where all sensors were lo-
cated on the waveguides. Some of them
were located on straight section of the pipes
whereas some other were located on bends
or on a coupler. As one can expect most
of the breakdowns where recorded near the
bent waveguides and near the coupler. Half
of these sensors were moved for the data
used by ﬁgure 17. Those sensors have
been relocated at the end of the accelerat-
ing structure, another location where many
breakdowns (but also a lot of noise) were ex-
pected. The location of the beakdowns on
that ﬁgure is conform to the expectations.

the X-band test stand.

On this event one can see that even
before the breakdown there is a lot of
noise recorded by the sensor, especially
the klystron noise at the beginning of the
record. The ﬁgure 15 (bottom) shows an
example of non breakdown event with high
intensity noise.

Thus to identify a breakdown it is neces-
sary to keep balance between the use of a
low threshold which would catch all break-
downs but would also catch non breakdown
noise and a higher threshold that would
not catch noise but might miss some of the
breakdowns.

To address this issue 3 diﬀerent level of

breakdowns have been deﬁned:

• A “simple” level, where all events
where the signal passes a given thresh-
old will be considered as a breakdown.

• A “long” level, where all events where
the signal passes a given threshold
and remains above this threshold for
a given time will be considered as a
breakdown.

• An “extended” level, where all events
where the signal passes a given thresh-
old and remains above this threshold
for a given (extended) time will be con-
sidered as a breakdown.

Furthermore most of the systematic com-
ponent of the noise (such as klystron noise)
can be removed by substracting to the
recorded noise the average noise recorded
during 200 recent events.

Figure 17: X-band analysis. Half of this sensors used for this analysis were installed on
waveguide components and the other half were installed at the exit of the accelerating
structure. The diﬀerent colors correspond to diﬀerent breakdown threshold. Dashed line
correspond to simple breakdown and plain line to long breakdowns.

4 Conclusion

It has been veriﬁed that the information extracted from the acoustic sensors is correlated
with the information available from other sources.

Acoustic sensors can provide useful information on the location of breakdowns in an
accelerator structure. They are very easy to install and to move to survey diﬀerent areas
of the test stand. The resolution that can be acheived is directly related to the number
of sensors available.

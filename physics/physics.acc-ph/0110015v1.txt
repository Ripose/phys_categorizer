Abstract

The observation of plasma focusing of a 28.5 GeV positron beam is reported.

The plasma was formed by ionizing a nitrogen jet only 3 mm thick. Simul-

taneous focusing in both transverse dimensions was observed with eﬀective

focusing strengths of order Tesla per micron. The minimum area of the beam

spot was reduced by a factor of 2.0 ± 0.3 by the plasma. The longitudinal

beam envelope was measured and compared with numerical calculations.

The plasma lens has been proposed as a ﬁnal focusing element to improve the luminosity

of future high energy electron-positron colliders [1]. In this letter we report the observation,

at the FFTB facility [2] at SLAC, of the focusing of a 28.5 GeV positron beam by a nitrogen

plasma lens.

The focusing mechanism for bunched relativistic beams, of either charge, is the collective

reaction of the plasma electrons to the relativistically foreshortened electromagnetic ﬁeld of

the bunch. Even in the time scale of a few picoseconds, plasma electrons are able to migrate

towards a balance between the superimposed beam ﬁeld and the collective ﬁeld caused by

separating the charges of the plasma. The primary eﬀect is a partial neutralization of the

electric ﬁeld of the bunch. Whereas, in free space, the radial electric and toroidal magnetic

ﬁelds of the bunch apply equal but opposite forces on the beam particles — so that there is

no net focusing or defocusing — this balance is lost in plasma and self-focusing occurs [1].

The collective motion of plasma electrons is characterized by the plasma wavelength,

λp = qπ/renp, re being the classical electron radius and np the plasma density. Although

this plasma current tends to cancel the beam’s toroidal magnetic ﬁeld, its characteristic

dimensions do not necessarily allow that to happen eﬃciently. For interesting cases, the

beam spot is smaller than the plasma wavelength so that the beam toroidal ﬁeld is spatially

more concentrated than the plasma current and self-pinches the beam. As plasma density

rises further and its wavelength shortens, the ﬁelds overlap more completely and the pinch

is again suppressed.

Focusing by plasma has been veriﬁed in previous experiments [3] for low energy (3.8 - 50

MeV) electron beams several mm in transverse size, and with relatively low density plasmas

(≤ 1014 ions per cc). Plasma focusing of positrons had not previously been demonstrated,

and this was the primary goal of the present work. We also sought to extend the beam

energy into the multi-GeV range, using plasma densities three orders of magnitude higher

than before, and beam spot cross-sectional areas six orders of magnitude smaller than before.

(The experiment was limited in principle by the carbon ﬁbers of the measuring system,

which would be destroyed by spots of area less than 15 µm2 for beam pulses of 1.5 × 1010

2

positrons [4].)

The plasma lens was created by the ionization of molecules in a pulsed gas jet. An 800 µs

jet of nitrogen gas was released at 2 Hz into the vacuum chamber by a fast acting solenoid

valve, timed so that the gas ﬂow had stabilized when the positron beam passed through.

The nozzle diameter was 3 mm, the inlet pressure was 1000 psi for this experiment, and

the gas jet opening angle was 3◦. The local beam line pressure bump was minimized by

diﬀerentially pumping short sections between sets of 2 mm aperture thin-foil irises. A gas

density value of (6.5 ± 2.5) × 1018 cm−3 was obtained as an average of measurements made

by Michelson interferometry and from Bremsstrahlung observed during data taking.

As the positron beam passed through, ionization of the jet occurred by the normal energy

loss process [5], enhanced by avalanche collisions during acceleration by the beam ﬁeld. We

have found that an improved focusing eﬀect could be obtained by irradiating the gas with

focused, pulsed laser light. A commercially available Q-switched Nd:YAG laser delivered 10

Hz of 10 ns pulses at wavelength 1064 nm and pulse energies near 1.2 J. For comparison,

the positron pulse width was 4 ps FWHM. The light, incident on the gas jet at right angles

to the positron beam direction, was line focused astigmatically to a spot of 50 µm vertically

by 330 µm horizontally FWHM. It is estimated that about 0.1% of the laser energy was

absorbed through collisional ionization seeded by multiphoton absorption. The superheated

gas expanded in a shock-wave shell, and thus a wide range of available plasma densities

evolved over time. The time between the laser pulse and the beam was optimized (at about

400 ns) by observing the strength of the synchrotron radiation from the focusing. At this

time the ionization caused by the positron beam was much stronger than that remaining

from the laser, which had largely recombined and been spatially diluted. However, this

process requires further investigation and will not be discussed here.

The layout of the experiment around the plasma lens is shown in Figure 1. The direction

of the positron beam deﬁnes the z-axis of the right-handed coordinate system, and y is

vertical. The beam energy was set to 28.5 GeV, with 0.6 mm long bunches, normalized

emittances of 5 × 10−5 m-rad (x) and 5 × 10−6 m-rad (y), and 1.5 × 1010 particles per bunch.

3

Conventional magnets were set to focus the positrons near the plasma lens, where the

beam size was measured using a wires canner system. A carbon ﬁber of 7 µm diameter

was moved to a known position between 8 and 32 mm downstream of the entrance to the

gas jet. In an automated procedure, the positron beam was steered orthogonally across the

ﬁber in 1 µm steps (whose scale was calibrated to better than ±5%). Bremsstrahlung from

the carbon traveled 33 m downstream, escaped the vacuum pipe, showered in a 4 radiation

length stack of polyethylene plates, and was detected by an air Cherenkov counter [4]. The

correlation between steering and the Bremsstrahlung signal gave the beam proﬁle. We found

that the elliptical beam spot size at the lens was typically 11.5 µm by 2.5 µm. The beam

density within the 2σ contour was 2 × 1016 cm−3.

Interleaved among the plates were planar ion chambers used to monitor the several-MeV

critical energy of the synchrotron radiation emitted from the plasma lens (the Synchrotron

Radiation Monitor or SRM). The ion chambers also detected the Bremsstrahlung and were

used as a check on the spot size measurement.

As a way of reducing the eﬀects of drifts, measurements of plasma-on and plasma-oﬀ

beam spot proﬁles were interleaved within the scan. At each scan step of the beam, signals

from four pulses were recorded with the gas jet oﬀ, and averaged, and one was taken with

the jet ﬁring. These were plotted, as in Figure 2, against the scan position.

There are several other systematic eﬀects in the beam size measurement process. First of

all, the carbon ﬁber diameter contributes 1.7 µm in quadrature to the RMS beam size; this

is corrected for. Since it takes many beam pulses to make a proﬁle measurement, shot-to-

shot ﬂuctuations in the beam centroid position also contribute to the measured beam size.

By measuring the RMS ﬂuctuation at a ﬁxed ﬁber location and ﬁxed beam steering, this

contribution by itself is estimated to be 25% of the measured width, and when subtracted in

quadrature, it reduces the apparent beam width by 3%. For the data being reported here,

the elliptical positron beam spot also had a roll angle of 13◦ with respect to the x direction,

and this was accounted for.

An important correction was necessary because the strong focusing of the plasma in-

4

creased the beam divergence at the wire scanner. As the focused beam was scanned, a

portion of the Bremsstrahlung photon cone was occluded by a downstream ﬁxed aperture.

The total photon ﬂux, as given by the area under the scan proﬁle curve, was reduced by

30%. The systematic eﬀect was to make the scan proﬁle asymmetric because of the corre-

lation between the positron angle and position at the ﬁber. A check with the beam toroids

conﬁrmed that there was no loss in the charged beam ﬂux as it passed through the lens to

the dump.

To account for this eﬀect, the measured beam proﬁles have been ﬁtted to a Gaussian

function with diﬀerent widths allowed on either side of the peak. The larger width pa-

rameter was taken as the estimate of the unoccluded width. A ﬁrst order polynomial took

account of the background accompanying the beam, the synchrotron radiation, and beam-

gas Bremsstrahlung from the jet.

The accuracy of this procedure for determining the beam width has been estimated using

a ray-tracing simulation of the experiment. The incoming beam envelope was parameterized

with the help of upstream wire scanners, as well as jet-oﬀ local measurements at a range of z-

locations. These parameters were reproduced in the linear optics in the simulation. A model

for the beam-plasma collective focusing ﬁeld was then constructed [6]. This accounted for the

spatial variation of the plasma focusing strength within the bunch. The focused positrons

were followed to the carbon ﬁber, and the Bremsstrahlung photons traced from there to

occluding apertures downstream. The geometric parameters were adjusted to reproduce the

observed loss in the photon transmission. Using the same asymmetric Gaussian ﬁt procedure

as for the real data, the simulation showed some variations over the z-range that lead us

to assign an uncertainty of ±5% for data without the plasma, and ±15% for the heavily

occluded cases with plasma. These are taken as systematic uncertainties in the beam size

measurements.

The plasma focusing was studied by making multiple measurements of the x- and y-

proﬁles of the beam envelope at several values of z within the accessible range. Data at

the same settings were averaged. The plasma-on data are compared with the simultaneous

5

plasma-oﬀ envelope in Figure 3. The pinch is quite striking as seen in the y direction. From

the y divergence angles, the lens quadrupole strength may be estimated to be 4 T/µm, and

from the ﬁtted waist positions the eﬀective focal length is 1.6 mm. The values in the x

direction are 0.7 T/µm and 34 mm.

Numerical integration over the expected transverse ﬁeld proﬁle of an ideal plasma lens

shows that these values of quadrupole strength would yield synchrotron radiation with ef-

fective Critical Energies Ec [7] of 4.6 and 3.4 MeV respectively. As a test of this, for a few

representative scans we have examined the signals from the SRM chambers as a function

of depth in the polyethylene. A simple simulation, based on the electromagnetic shower

code EGS4 [8], was made of the response of the detectors to synchrotron radiation. The

depth proﬁle led to a value Ec = 4.4 ± 0.3 MeV, in satisfactory agreement with the range of

expected values.

Luminosity depends on the inverse of the minimum cross-sectional area of the beam,

and this was reduced by a factor of 2.0 ± 0.3 by the plasma lens. However, the beam time

available was inadequate for tuning the x- and y-focal spots to the same z-location, either

for the plasma on or oﬀ, and so we cannot report directly the reduction of spots as they

would be optimized for luminosity. Also, aberrations are expected in plasma lenses from

imperfect charge distributions [9], and tuning the beam optics to minimize their eﬀects was

not practical in this run.

A three-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) electromagnetic simulation code is being de-

veloped to describe the focusing process in this experiment for both positrons and electrons.

In particular it will allow for the σx/σy = 4.8 aspect ratio and the beam-induced ionization.

At present, results are available from a simpliﬁed two-dimensional PIC simulation. Plasma

focusing in the x- and y-planes was simulated separately using a round beam conﬁguration

where the size was selected to be σx or σy as appropriate. In order to maintain the same

focusing strength, the number of beam particles was scaled by the aspect ratio between the

two cases. A uniform plasma was used, 3 mm thick with a density of 5 × 1017 cm−3. Since

this density was greater than that of the beam, the focusing eﬀect was in the self-limiting

6

range and insensitive to the exact density assumed. Considering the simpliﬁcations that

have been made, the results, shown as lines in Figure 3, agree reasonably with the data,

indicating that more complete simulations will have predictive power.

In summary, we have reported the observation of focusing of high energy positron beams

by a thin lens of dense plasma. Simultaneous reduction of the beam spot in both dimensions

was observed. Future work toward applying the technique to linear colliders will, however,

require improvements to the available simulation codes and to the understanding of plasma

production processes.

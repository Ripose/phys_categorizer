Accelerator Neutrino Beams

Sacha E. Kopp,

Abstract

Neutrino beams at from high-energy proton accelerators have been instrumental
discovery tools in particle physics. Neutrino beams are derived from the decays of
charged π and K mesons, which in turn are created from proton beams striking thick
nuclear targets. The precise selection and manipulation of the π/K beam control the
energy spectrum and type of neutrino beam. This article describes the physics of
particle production in a target and manipulation of the particles to derive a neutrino
beam, as well as numerous innovations achieved at past experimental facilities.

A Kinematic Relations

1 Introduction

Neutrino beams at accelerators have served as laboratories for greater understanding of
the neutrino itself, but also have harnessed the neutrino as a probe to better understand
the weak nuclear force and its uniﬁcation with the electromagnetic force, the existence of
strongly-bound quarks inside the proton and neutron, and the recent revelations that neutri-
nos undergo quantum mechanical oscillations between ﬂavor types, a strong indication that
neutrinos have non-zero mass. Excellent reviews of these topics are available, for example,
in [45, 83, 105, 89, 153, 163, 195].

The present article discusses so-called conventional neutrino beams, those in which a
high-energy proton beam is impinged upon a nuclear target to derive a beam of pion and
kaon secondaries, whose decays in turn yield a neutrino beam. Such beams have been
operated at Brookhaven, CERN, Fermilab, KEK, Los Alamos and Serpukhov, and new
facilities at Fermilab, J-PARC, and CERN are underway. The present article cannot be
taken as a complete catalog of every facility. Rather, the intent is to discuss some of the basic
physical processes in meson production in a nuclear target, the manipulation (focusing) of
the secondary beam before its decay to neutrinos, and the measurements which can validate
the experimentally-controlled spectrum. As such, it is useful to refer to earlier papers in
which such ideas were ﬁrst developed, in addition to “state-of-the art” papers written about
contemporary facilities. These notes will not cover so-called “beam-dump” experiments, for
which very thorough reviews are already available [148, 208].

There are two valuable references on conventional neutrino beams to which readers may
refer: the ﬁrst is the proceedings of three workshops held at CERN [1]-[3] at a time in
which the accelerator neutrino beam concept was in its infancy. The second is a set of work-
shops [4]-[9] held at KEK, Fermilab, and CERN. Initiated by Kazuhiro Tanaka of KEK, this
workshop series arose at a time of renaissance for the neutrino beam, when “long-baseline”
neutrino oscillation experiments required new developments in accelerator technology to de-
liver intense neutrino beams across distances 200-900 km through the Earth. Both workshop
series are valuable documentation of the ingenuities of the experimental teams.

While much has been written about neutrino interactions and detectors, comparatively
little has been written about the facilities to produce these beams. In as much as these notes
collect those references which may not be commonly known, I hope they will be helpful.

2 Accelerator Neutrino Beam Concept

The idea of an accelerator neutrino beam was proposed independently by Schwartz[191] and
Pontecorvo [183]. The experiment, ﬁrst carried out by Lederman, Schwartz, Steinberger and
collaborators [84], demonstrated the existence of two neutrino ﬂavors.1 Figure 1 shows their
apparatus. In brief, a proton beam strikes a thick nuclear target, producing secondaries, such
as pions and kaons. Those secondaries leave the target, boosted in the forward direction but
with some divergence given by production cross sections d2σ/dpT dxF (pT is the momentum
pL/pproton is the ratio of the
of the secondary transverse to the proton beam axis, xF ≈
secondary particle’s longitudinal momentum along the beam axis to the proton beam mo-
mentum). The mesons, permitted to drift in free space, decay to neutrino tertiaries. In the
21 m. Shielding, often referred to as the “beam stop”
1962 experiment, the drift space was
or “muon ﬁlter,” removes all particles in the beam except for the neutrinos, which continue
on to the experiment. The 1962 experiment was a “bare target” beam, meaning that the
experiment saw the direct decays of the secondaries, which were not in any way focused prior
to their decay.

1It’s interesting to note that the ﬁrst accelerator neutrino beam was suﬃciently new that the authors felt
a need to put the word “beam” in quotations [84]. Though we perhaps should still do so today (no one has
yet focused a neutrino), the current experimental facilities have certainly evolved in 44 years.

πeνe decays (BR=38.8%)
posals have been made to produce an enhanced νe beam from KL →
[165, 166, 171, 69, 70], though these have not been realized. Comparatively few experiments
have utilized the residual νe contamination in their beam [16, 100]. Most νe beams are
τ ντ
produced from beam dump experiments [208, 148], as are ντ beams arising from Ds →
decays [184, 134]. For conventional neutrino beams, the neutrino spectra may be derived
from the π/K meson spectra and the kinematics of meson decay in ﬂight. Some useful
relations for the kinematics of π/K decay in ﬂight are given in Appendix A.

The 1962 neutrino experiment didn’t actually extract a proton beam. The circulating
protons in the BNL AGS were brought to strike an internal Be target in a 3 m straight
section of the accelerator and those resulting secondaries at 7.5◦ angle with respect to the
proton direction contributed to the neutrino ﬂux. A deﬂector sent the protons to strike the
target for 25 µsec bursts [84]. The idea of an extracted proton beam dedicated for a neutrino
experiment came from CERN [115, 179]. There are at least three important motivators for
the switch from the internal target to fast-extracted external beams:

•

•

The extraction eﬃciency onto the internal target was not perfect (about 70%, according
to [84] or 50% in [141], to be compared with nearly 100% for the fast-extraction[115]).

The CERN team developed a lens [200] to better collect the pions leaving the tar-
get, which was much more eﬃcient than taking those few secondaries at 7.5◦ to the
beam direction, and this lens system is large (couldn’t be located in or around the
synchrotron).

•

The van der Meer lens is an electromagnet sourced by a pulsed current which required
short beam pulses (< 1 msec) to avoid overheating from the pulsed current.

The second BNL neutrino run did use an extracted beam [66, 85], though still no focusing
of the secondaries [146]. Extracted beams are the norm in today’s experiments.

The short beam pulses from single-turn extractions are one of the advantages of accelera-
10−6, the experiment
tor neutrino experiments: with the beam only live for a duty fraction
(provided it has fast enough electronics) has the ability to close its trigger acceptance around
a small “gate” period around the accelerator pulse, reducing false triggers cosmic ray muons.2
Neutrino experiments require expansive numbers of protons delivered to their targets.
1011 protons-per-pulse
The 1962 experiment received 1.6
(ppp)[109]. Today’s experiments require 1020
1021 protons on target (POT)3. Since the
number of pion and kaon secondaries per proton grows with the incident proton beam energy,
a good ﬁgure of merit is (POT
Beam Energy). Figure 2 shows Joules per experiment since
the ﬁrst accelerator neutrino experiment. Forthcoming experiments such as CNGS, JPARC
and NOνA are not shown, but are another order of magnitude in accumulated dose.

circulating beam consisting of a train of 20 nsec “buckets” of protons separated by 220 nsec [109].

3 Production of Hadrons in the Target

Introduction

3.1
Neutrino experiments require information about the production of π+, π−, K +, K −, and
KL. Further, production yields, d2N/dpdΩ, as a function of the secondary’s momentum and
angle emerging from the target are necessary: the secondary’s momentum is related to the
resulting neutrino energy (see Appendix A), and the production angle relates to how well the
secondary points along the direction of the desired neutrino beam, or to the degree to which
the secondary is captured by the focusing system. Models of secondary production have been
derived by ﬁtting and interpolating experimental data on p + A

π±X or p + A

KX.

a target is the bane of every neutrino experiment. ANL, for example, performed a “beam
survey” of the yield of secondaries from 12.5 GeV protons on thick targets of Aℓ and Be [149],
only to be surprised [90] by their neutrino ﬂux being oﬀ by a factor of two compared with
subsequent but more limited beam surveys [25, 156]. The experiment scaled up the older,
more complete d2N/dpdΩ results to agree with the normalizations of the newer experiment
(such was suggested by Sanford & Wang, who had tried a ﬁt to all invariant cross section
data[189]) and quoted [141] 30% errors on the neutrino ﬂux as a result. Another round
of beam surveys was done [81] which ﬁxed the normalization problem and covered the full
phase space, and these results were used in subsequent papers [71, 155]. As the authors of
[71] put it: “The calculation of the ν ﬂux ... requires a detailed discussion, which we will
defer to a subsequent publication.” These are hard experiments to get right.

scaling [104] of relevance for neutrino ﬂux predictions. Shown is the distribution of pz and
pz/p0 for π+ produced by protons striking a graphite target as estimated using
of xF ≈
the Fluka-2005 [106] Monte Carlo code, where p0 is the primary proton beam momentum
and pz the longitudinal momentum of the secondary (deﬁned in Figure 3). Distributions are
shown for incident proton momenta p0=10, 20, 40, 80, 120, 450 GeV/c. The shapes of the
xF distributions are quite similar, indicating that the pion momenta scale with p0. It is also
of note that the integrals of these curves, i.e. the mean number of π+ produced per proton
on target, grows nearly linearly with p0 (see Table 2).

Figure 5 demonstrates another important aspect of hadron production: the Fermi mo-
mentum of partons inside the nucleons being
200 MeV, and the fact that momen-

and the peak transverse momentum is of order 250 MeV for the secondaries. Figure 5 shows
very little evolution of the pT shape for diﬀerent incident momenta p0 or exiting pion momenta
pz. That pT does not scale (very much) is important because the transverse momentum is
what controls the divergence of the secondary beam: mesons with pT = 0 are directed along
the beam line, and their neutrino daughters tend to follow the secondaries’ direction. It is
fortunate that the amount of pT to remove by focusing (see Section 4) does not grow rapidly
with pion momentum.

The linearly increasing secondary yield with incident beam momentum has an important
impact on neutrino beam design.
It is often argued that to produce a lower-momentum
neutrino beam one must deliver a lower momentum proton beam at the target, the rationale
being that at lower energy machine can be operated at higher repetition rate. However,
a given neutrino beam energy is achieved by focusing a particular secondary beam pion
momentum. As shown in Figure 4 and Table 2, the yield at a ﬁxed momentum appears to
drop (approximately linearly) with decreasing proton beam momentum. Thus, the beneﬁt
of a lower-momentum, higher rep-rate, accelerator is cancelled by the lower pion yield per
proton on target. The only reason for changing the accelerator energy might be to achieve
higher secondary momenta than accessible at a lower-energy machine.

While the above discussion of scaling is qualitatively correct, current experimental data
indicate that these scaling behaviours are not exact. In fact, the Fluka Monte Carlo shown
in Figures 4 and 5, being tuned to such data, demonstrates such scaling violations.

The geometry of the target is of particular note for prediction of the neutrino spectrum.
The geometry’s signiﬁcance arises because secondary particles exiting the p+A collision have
greater probability of reinteraction in the target material for longer pathlengths. Secondary
interactions are expected to decrease the yield of high-energy particles and increase the
yield of low-energy particles, as reﬂected in the Fluka calculation of Figure 6. Plotted are

the fraction of the π+ which are not produced by the primary p+C collision, but instead
by subsequent reinteractions of the exiting particles. As also shown in the ﬁgure, such
reinteractions occur with greater probability in high energy proton beam experiments. For
very high energy neutrino beams, produced from high-momentum secondaries, the target is
segmented as shown in Figure 3, with
10) cm “slugs” separated by gaps so as to
−
permit small-angle, high-momentum secondaries to escape the target with less path length
for reinteraction. For low-energy neutrino beams, derived from low-momentum secondaries,
such segmentation is not advantageous from the point of pion yield.4 At CERN’s CNGS
line, the target consists 13 slugs of 10 cm graphite separated by 9 cm, appropriate for its

4Segmented targets are of beneﬁt for all high-power neutrino beams, however, for reducing longitudinal
stress accumulation in the target due to heating from the proton beam. Solid targets have failed under the
shock wave which propagates along the target’s length [214].

focus on collection of 40 GeV/c pions [62].

When lacking the hadron production data which reproduces the exact conditions in a
neutrino experiment, experimenters must rely on models to extrapolate such data to condi-
tions of relevance for a given accelerator neutrino beam. Some of the factors which must be
accounted for are:

(a) interpolating between a sparse set of measurements at ﬁxed values of secondary mo-

menta p or transverse momenta pT ,

(b) extrapolating from measured yields oﬀ one nuclear target material to the one of rele-

vance (Be, Aℓ, C, W, ...) for the neutrino beam.

(c) extrapolating to the correct projectile momentum p0 on the target

(d) extrapolating to the correct target dimensions from those used in a hadron production

experiment.

Neutrino experiments have tried to derive these yields in auxilliary particle production ex-
periments, either controlling or correcting for eﬀects (a)-(d).

3.2 Hadron Production Experiments

Table 3 summarizes several of the hadron production experiments conducted over a range
of incident proton momenta from 10 GeV/c to 450 GeV/c . As can be seen from the table,
many cover only limited ranges of xF and pT , owing to the geometry of the experiment.
There are two main types of experiments: single-arm spectrometers (shown schematically in
Figure 7) and full-acceptance specrometers (shown schematically in Figure 8).

11

Figure 8: Layout of the Alt et al.
(NA49) [20] full-acceptance spectrometer at CERN.
The extracted proton beam is directed at a target and the secondaries are tracked by time-
projection chambers embedded in analyzing magnets.

Single-arm spectrometers direct secondary particles within a small angular acceptance
∆Ω into a magnetic channel in which dipoles deﬁne a secondary momentum bite ∆p and
quadrupoles are used to focus the secondaries within this momentum bite into the analyzing
channel. Particle identiﬁcation is accomplished by either TOF or Cherenkov systems or both.
The measurements are conducted with slow-spill beams to enable single secondary particle
counting. Normalization uncertainties on yields range from
25)% due to the diﬃculty
in proton counting: current-integrating toroids function well only in fast-spill (µsec) beam
pulses, and in slow spill beams the proton intensity must be monitored either by secondary
emission monitors (SEMs) or by the induced radioactivation in thin foils placed upstream
of the target. SEMs are diﬃcult to calibrate due to the decreasing secondary-electron yield
after prolonged exposure [22, 102], and foil-based normalizations require knowledge of the
production cross sections for the radionuclides, which are not typically known to better
than 10% [31].5 In addition, spectrometer measurements require accurate knowledge of their
acceptance. Ratios such as π+/π− or K +/π+ are often better-measured.

5Some neutrino experiments, which are fast-extracted and so could use current toroids to measure protons-
on-target, would take their normalization from foil activation techniques, to better match what the hadron
production experiments did for proton normalization [47].

Full-acceptance spectrometers are a relatively recent and quite sophisticated undertaking.
A wide acceptace tracking device, such as a time-projection chamber (TPC) is placed down-
stream or even surrounding the target. Analyzing magnets surround the tracking system.
For small-angle particles, downstream drift chamber planes are used. Particle identiﬁcation
is achieved by dE/dx in the tracking chamber or by downstream TOF or Cherenkov coun-
ters. The ﬁrst attempt at such a full-acceptance measurement was at CERN, in which a
replica Cu target for the CERN-PS neutrino line was placed inside the Ecole Polytechnique
heavy liquid bubble chamber [172]. More recent examples are the NA49, HARP, and MIPP
experiments, all based on TPCs.

Neutrino targets are 1-2 nuclear interaction lengths so as to increase the fraction of the
proton beam reacting in the target, hence the yield of secondaries. Many particle production
experiments, however, by measuring invariant cross sections, must perform their experiments
on thin (1-5)% interaction length targets. In so doing such experiments do not have any
sensitivity to the eﬀect of reinteractions of particles produced in the primary p + A as these
secondary particles traverse the target. A measurement of particle production in “thick
targets” is shown in Figure 10. The data are compared to a “naive absorption model” [59]

where θ is the production angle, L the target length, z the longitudinal position along the
target, tres(z) the residual target thickness to be crossed by the secondary particle to escape
the target. The three terms in the integral represent the probability that the proton does
not interact up to z, the secondary is not reabsorbed, and the primary proton does interact
between z and z +dz [22]. The data show excess particle production over such a naive model.
New measurements with full-acceptance spectrometers are forthcoming from BNL E910
[150, 132] which took thin-target data, from HARP at CERN which studied a replica of
the MiniBooNE Be target [190] and of the K2K Al target, and from Fermilab E907 which
studied 120 GeV/c protons incident on a replica of the NuMI target [160].

3.3 Some Parameterizations and Models

Without going into a complete list of all models, here are mentioned some models which
have been employed in neutrino ﬂux calculations. We shall not discuss some older mod-
els/parameterizations, such as the Von Dardel [206] used at CERN, Stefanski-White [194]
used at Fermilab, or thermodynamic models [117] used at CERN, Fermilab.

The merit of the shower cascade models is that they (claim to) contain all the necessary
physics. They tend to be “black boxes,” however, in that one cannot modify them to suit
one’s neutrino data. Such is the merit of parametric models. Comparing models to one’s
neutrino data is an unsatisfying way to evaluate systematic uncertainties, and in Sections 7
and 8 other techniques are discussed to adapt one’s models to neutrino data.

3.3.1 Shower Cascade Models

Shower cascade models oﬀer physics-driven descriptions of the cascade of particles initiated
by a proton interaction in a nuclear target. These codes allow the user to describe a complex
geometry of a nuclear target, impinge a beam into the target, and follow the progeny of the
interactions through the target, allowing them to subsequently escape the target, or further
scatter/interact to produce other particles. Such models therefore are critical to extrapolat-
ing data with respect to the beam momentum, target material A, and understanding thick
target eﬀects. The state-of-the-art models include MARS-v.15 [157], Fluka-2005[106], and
DPMJET-III [94]. Other models, such as GHEISHA [113], GCALOR [111], Geant/Fluka
[114], or Geant4 [112] appear to have discrepencies with published hadron production data in
certain kinematic regimes [129]. MARS-v.15 and Fluka-2005 have been tuned to accomodate
the SPY data, but not measurements from HARP, BNL-E910, or NA49.

to Cho et al [81] and Allaby et al [17] are found to be consistent with new data from HARP
[78] within 10%, so this model appears quite satisfactory for “low-energy” thin target data.

4 Focusing of Wide Band Beams

The ﬁrst accelerator neutrino experiment [84, 66] was a “bare target beam,” meaning that
the proton beam was delivered to the target, and the meson secondaries emanating from the
target were permitted to drift freely away from the target. The only collimation or increase
of ﬂux is achieved by the relativistic boost of the secondaries in the forward direction. The
ﬁrst neutrino experiment at Fermilab [51, 52] was likewise supplied by a bare-target beam.
Focusing of the secondaries from the target is essential for increasing the neutrino ﬂux
to the detectors on axis with the beam line. In pion decay, the ﬂux of neutrinos at a given
decay angle θ with respect to the pion direction is (see Appendix A):

φν =

(9)

where A is the size of the detector, z is its distance from the pion decay point, and γ is
the pion boost factor. If no focusing is employed, the pions diverge from the target with a
typical angle

1/γ, so is important to correct. Perfect focusing of pions should, in this simple
pion decay,
model, improve the ﬂux of neutrinos by

4.1 Horn Focusing

Simon van der Meer developed the idea of the “magnetic horn,” [200] a focusing device
to collect the secondary pions and kaons from the target and directing them toward the
downstream experiments, thereby increasing the neutrino ﬂux.7

The magnetic horn consists of two axially-symmetric conductors with a current sheet run-
ning down the inner conductor and returning on the outer conductor, as shown in Figure 11.
Between the conductors is produced a toroidal magnetic ﬁeld whose qv
B force provides a
restoring force for particles of one sign (π+ or π−), and defocuses particles of the other sign,
thus enhancing a νµ beam while reducing νµ background, for example. The focusing device
is unusual in accelerator physics in so far as the particles must traverse the lens conductors,
causing some loss and scattering of particles. Ref [202] is a thorough consideration of a
various trajectories of particles through such a lens and the angles and momenta that can
be focused by a particular horn geometry.

×

Horns must withstand magnetic forces and the thermal load from the pulsed current and
beam energy deposition in the horn conductors. Since the early 1970’s, beam intensities were

7The name is said to be given by the similarity of the horn’s geometric shape to a Swiss alpenhorn.
Panofsky [175], however, called van der Meer’s device the “Horn of Plenty.” The name in the U.S. almost
stuck [141].

high enough that these components become quite radioactive following extended running.
Systems for remotely-handling any failed components are necessary [95, 103, 210]. Designs
of horns now are quite reﬁned and employ full analyses of the vibrations and strains on the
horn (see, e.g.
[87, 34] and the many contributions to [5]-[9]). Further, current-delivery
systems have gone from large coaxial cables over to metallic transmission lines[168, 38] able
to better withstand intense radiation ﬁelds and magnetic forces. The following sections
consider various geometries of horns and their focusing properties.

4.1.1 Conical Horns

Van der Meer’s original horn was a conical surface for the inner conductor [200, 202]. Such a
device, indicated in Figure 12, does a good job at focusing all momenta for a given angle of
pion into the horn, θin = r/ℓ. To see this, note that the magnetic ﬁeld of the device varies
inversely with radius, B = µ0I/2πr, and the angular deﬂection of the pion in the magnetic
ﬁeld (the “pT kick”), in the “thin-lens approximation,” is:

where I is the horn current, p is the pion momentum, and x is the pathlength of the pion
through the horn magnetic ﬁeld region (see Figure 12).

Recalling that the incident pion angle and momentum are inversely related (c.f. Equa-
tion 10), we have that the average incident angle for pions into the horn is θin ≈ h
/p.
A focused pion is one in which θout = 0, or in other words the pT kick cancels the incident
angle of the pion into the horn. One sets this pT kick to the average incident angle:

Figure 12: Trajectory of a π+ and a π− through a single conical horn focusing element.
An axially-symmetric current sheet down the inner conducting shell produces a toroidal
magnetic ﬁeld between the inner and outer conductors of the horn, providing a restoring
force for one sign of particles.

This says that the pathlength in the horn should grow linearly with the radius of entrance
into the horn, in other words a cone-shaped horn. The momentum cancels out of the ﬁnal
equation, implying this is a broad-band beam.

Equation 11 is derived in the limit of large source distance compared to the horn size,
ℓ >> x, and the small angle approximation for the pion angle θin. For many horns, these
approximations are not valid. Further, not all pions have the average
(not all incident
angles θin are at the average or most likely angle θin).

4.1.2 Parabolic Horns

It was apparently Budker who ﬁrst conceived of a magnetic horn with parabolic-shaped inner
conductors [63]. Such a device focuses a given momentum for all possible angles of entry
into the horn. It appears that such was conceived in 1961, and ﬁrst attempted by his group
at Novosibirsk to improve the collection of positrons from a target for an e+e− collider [87].
The parabolic lens was studied for its eﬃciency in collecting mesons for a neutrino beam by
a Serpukhov group [86], and ﬁrst implemented in a neutrino beam at the IHEP accelerator
[35, 38].

A parabolic horn, like that shown in Figure 12, is one whose inner conductor follows a
curve z = ar2, with the parabolic parameter a in cm−1. The pT kick of any horn results in
a change in angle of

(12)

There are two diﬀerences with the conical horn: (1) the parabolic horn works for all angles
(within the limit of the small angle approximation), not just the “most likely angle” θin =
/p, and (2) a single parabolic horn has a strong chromatic dependence (its focal length
pT i

depends directly on particle momentum p).

For the parabolic horn, the Coulomb scattering of particles through the horn conductors
does not degrade the focusing quality for any pion momentum: considering a parallel beam
incident on the horn, the spot size, S, at the focal point of the horn will be due to Coulomb
scattering in the horn material:

where

is the typical scattering angle in the horn conductor, t the conductor thickness, and X0 the
conductor material radation length. Thus

Thus, the quality of the focus is independent of the momentum, and improves with larger
horn current, thinner conductors, lighter-weight materials with longer radiation lengths X0,

or longer horns with larger parameter a. The fact that the focusing quality is independent of
p means one can almost calculate a spectrum with simple ray tracing and require no Monte
Carlo calculation [110]. To compensate the fact that particles entering the horn at larger
δ√1 + 4a2r2, horns are often designed with
radii traverse greater thickness of material t
tapered conductor thicknesses, the neck region being the thickest.8

≈

Figure 14 is a demonstration performed by the Serpukhov group [87] of the momentum-
focusing properties of the parabolic horn. A 130 MeV/c electron beam is injected into the
parabolic horn oﬀ-axis from the left. After passing through the horn, the focusing causes a
convergence of the electron rays at a distance from the horn equal to the focal length, after
which the electron beam enlarges in size again. The beam size before the horn and at several
locations after the horn is measured using photographic ﬁlm. The circular spot indicates no
aberrations despite oﬀ-axis injection and the measured focal length agreed with predictions.

4.1.3 Ellipsoidal Lenses

The authors of [87] (from Budker’s Novosibirsk group) show, in addition to the proposed
parabolic surface, a slightly-less tapered inner conductor shape which they term the “aber-
rationless” surface. The nature of such an alternative inner conductor shape is better-
elucidated in Ref. [93], in which is shown that an ellipsoidal inner conductor surface is a
better focusing device across wider angles of entrance to the horn. Such also appears to have
been understood by Budker [64].

The ellipsoidal lens is again one in which the focal length f is a linear function of mo-

mentum:

4πb2
µ0aI
where the I is again the horn current, and a and b are the major and minor half-axes (in
cm) of the ellipsoid.

(13)

f =

As noted in [93], the parabolic lens is derived in the “thin lens” approximation, and
further requires a small-angle approximation for the particles’ incident angles into the horns:

As can be seen in Figure 15, the parabolic lens is an approximation of the ellipsoid surface
for small-angle particles.

4.1.4 Magnetic Fingers

Palmer [173] proposed a variant of the magnetic horn which he dubbed “magnetic ﬁngers.”
His variation required an axially symmetric pair of pulsed conductors, but considered inner
conductor shapes other than conical surfaces. Following numerical calculations, his inner
conductor shape reminded him of a human digit, shown in Figure 16. Such shapes were
adopted for two-horn beams at BNL [75, 76], and the BNL horns subsequently informed the
designs for KEK [215], MiniBooNE[140], and JPARC [128].

The numerical calculation of ideal focusing for a particle of momentum p is detailed
thoroughly in [93], and dispenses with both the small-angle and thin-lens approximations,
computing the curvature of a particle through the lens itself to obtain the required incident
coordinates (z, r) at which a particle of momentum p should enter the horn in order to be

focused (θout = 0 at the horn exit). Figure 15 shows such a horn shape in comparison to the
ellipsoid and parabolic approximations, in which it is assumed that the horn is a “half-lens,”
i.e.: one in which the conductor is tapered upstream of its neck, but whose current sheet
becomes vertical at z = f , where f is the focal length (similar assumption to Figure 16).

The ideal surface in Figure 15 has the visual appearance of a lopsided ellipse, similar to

lenses described by Budker’s group [64].

4.2 Multi-horn Systems

Palmer [173] noted that multiple focusing elements can improve the neutrino ﬂux because
subsequent focusing elements can be used to “rescue” pion trajectories improperly focused
by the ﬁrst focusing element. Such a multi-lens system was adopted at CERN PS neutrino
beam [26, 27, 177] and nearly every WBB since (see Table 1). A double horn system was
also implemented for the CERN Antiproton Accumulator [203].

Palmer [173] gives a clear motivation for the multiple lenses: a lens provides a deﬁnite
“pT kick” given by ∆θ whose value can be calculated given the horn shape, current, and
the particle momentum p. The horn is tuned to give a pT kick equal to this most probable
entrance angle θin =

/p into the horn:

pT i

h

∆θ = θin.

Many particles emerging from the target will have a pT not equal to the mean
, resulting
in particles, at the same momentum p, entering the horn at a variety of angles. Assume we
would like to focus all particles between θin = 0 and θin = 2θin. A particle entering the
horn at θin will thus emerge from the horn with outgoing angle

pT i

h

θin −

the ﬁrst lens. A third lens could similarly be expected to bring the overall divergence down
a factor of 8, but must be located even further downstream to continue the point source
approximation for the incoming particles. Techniques for design of multiple lens systems,
including lens sizes, focal lengths, and inter-lens distances, based upon transfer matrices
have been developed in [86].

A three-lens system was adopted for the 1967 CERN run[26, 27, 177], with the second
35 m from the target, more than half-way down

horn 15 m from the horn-1 and the third

Serpukhov adopted a three-horn beam [35, 38], which had the distinction of a two-lens
horn, shown in Figure 19: the ﬁrst horn consisted of two tapered regions with two “necks,”
giving the equivalent of a pair of lenses. In this sense the IHEP beam was actually a four-lens

Figure 18: Three-horn focusing system employed at CERN for the 1967 neutrino run, taken

and each has a larger inner aperture to leave un-perturbed those particles well-focused by
the upstream horns.

Figure 21 shows the predicted neutrino spectrum from the two-horn system of NuMI
at FNAL. Also shown are the components of this spectrum corresponding to the diﬀerent
pion trajectories of Figure 17. As the angle of the neutrino parent decreases, one expects its
momentum p
/θ to increase. The pions focused by only horn 1 give softer neutrinos
than those focused only by horn 2. It is of note that the peak of the neutrino energy spectrum
comes from particles which pass through the focusing system, while the “high energy tail”
comes from particles which pass through the ﬁeld-free apertures of the horns. Figure 22
shows the two components from π and K decays common to horn-focused beams.

The NuMI beam at Fermilab implemented a “continuously variable” neutrino energy
capability by mounting the target on a rail drive system that permits up to 2.5 m travel
along the beam direction [139]. The target’s remote control permits change of the neutrino
energy without unstacking of the shielding elements. The utility of such a system is that it
can assist in understanding detailed systematics of the neutrino energy spectrum observed
in the detectors [161]. The principle of the variable energy beam relies upon Equation 12:
since f
p, the momentum at which point-to-parallel focusing is achieved will increase
as the source distance is increased. Thus in the thin-lens approximation one expects linear
dependence of the peak focused neutrino energy upon the target position ℓ. Such is borne out
by simple Monte Carlo calculation (see Figure 23), and by observation in the NuMI/MINOS
neutrino data [161].10 Further discussion is found in Section 8.

9A double-neck conical horn was attempted at Fermilab,[168] but this was replaced in favor of a single

horn [116].

10The authors of Ref. [35] and [47] note that variations of the horn current and the target positions can be
used to vary the neutrino energy. However, these groups appear to have employed only variations in current,
and with a goal of increasing neutrino event rate at the detectors. The authors of [93, 10] note that linear
lenses permit diﬀerent target-horn placements to obtain low-, medium-, or high-pass beams.

4.3 Quadrupole-Focused Beams

Quadrupole-focused beams are generally less eﬃcient than horn focusing, but they are rel-
atively inexpensive and simpler to design, relying on magnets for conventional accelerator
rings and they need not be pulsed, permitting use in slow-spill beams.

4.3.1 Quadrupole Triplet

While a single quadrupole magnet acts like a focusing lens in one plane and a defocusing lens
in the other, pairs of quadrupoles act like a net focusing lens in both planes. Quadrupole
triplets, furthermore, help make the containment more similar in both planes [126, 188, 73].
The aperture of a quadrupole is typically much smaller than for a horn, but for high energy
neutrino beams such is not a limitation: recalling that secondaries oﬀ the target emerge
(c.f. Equation 10) with angular spread θ = (0.300 GeV/c)/p, a quadrupole’s acceptance is
well-matched to high-momentum secondaries. Figure 24 compares the neutrino ﬂux from a
horn-focused and quad triplet beam at a 500 GeV/c accelerator, for example. In principle, a
of the secondary
quadrupole system provides an exact focus for a particular momentum
beam, thus the double-peak structure in Figure 24 results from the decays of π’s and K’s
travelling in the secondary beam at the focused momentum

Despite providing an exact focus for particles at the design momentum

, a quadrupole
system is actually wide-band for detectors not too far away from the source [188]. As shown
in Figure 25, particles over-focused or under-focused illuminate a detector of radius R at a
distance D from the source. The momentum limits of the quadrupole system are deﬁned by

angular aperture of the triplet decreases the “depth of focus” (the momentum bite admitted
by the quadrupoles), in analogy with geometric optics [188]. As D

bite also goes to zero, so quad focusing is appropriate only for “short baseline” experiments.

doublet larger in the DF plane than the FD plane, which poses an aperture restriction in

The fact that the term a11 = 1 in Atriplet is responsible for the near identical focusing in both
planes. As noted in [73], subsequent quadrupole cells taking on adiabatically larger apertures
and smaller focusing ﬁeld strengths, serves to extend the momentum range of containment.

4.3.2 Sign-selected Quadrupole Triplet

A quadrupole system by itself focuses both signs of secondaries, thus in principle equal
ﬂuxes of νµ and νµ are obtained. In experiments in which pure νµ or ν µ beams are desired,
sign-selection of the secondaries must be done with a dipole to sweep out the wrong sign.
The NuTeV experiment at Fermilab employed such a “sign-selected quadrupole triplet” [56].
In practice, the aperture limit of the dipole, plus the lack of focusing along the dipole’s
length, limits the wide-band acceptance of such a system by a small amount (NuTeV tuned
to 225 GeV momentum selection, FWHM about 150 GeV). As can be seen in Figure 27, the
sign-selection signiﬁcantly reduces the wrong-sign contamination. Wrong-sign elimination is
especially important if running in ν mode because of the lower anti-neutrino cross sections.
Another important development in the NuTeV SSQT was the ability to target the proton
beam at an oﬀ-angle with respect to the neutrino line, thus reducing νe contamination in
the beam from KL decays. The wrong-sign and νe contaminations are signiﬁcantly less than
in a horn focused beam (for which νµ ∼
10% because of unfocused particles throught the
necks and νe ∼

1% from muon and K decays.).

33

4.4 Other focusing systems

4.4.1 Plasma Lens

The BNL-Columbia group [107] proposed an alternative to the horn called the “plasma
lens.” Based on an idea from Panofsky [174], the idea is to place a cylindrical insulating
vessel around the beam axis downstream of the target. The vessel has electrodes pulsed at
10 kV at its end and partial atmosphere N2 or Ar gas inside. A plasma discharge with
∼
105 Amp/cm2 is initiated at the outer wall and spreads throughout
current densities of
the tube. The axial current thus produces a toroidal magnetic ﬁeld, much like the horn12.
Particles of one sign only are focused.

∼

Some notable diﬀerences between a horn and a plasma lens:

•

The plasma lens in principle has no hole in its center (unlike the horn). In practice,
neutrino beams supplied by proton beams with 400-4000 kW power would probably
ﬁnd this infeasible.

•

One can control the radial distribution of current density in the plasma to “tune” the
magnetic ﬁeld.

4.4.2 DC-Operated Lenses

The horns of various neutrino beams have been operated at pulse-to-pulse cycle times of
0.2 s (FNAL-MiniBooNE), 2 sec (CERN-PS, BNL-AGS, FNAL-NuMI), to 20 sec (FNAL-
Tevatron), designed to operate in conjunction with the cycle time of the synchrotron source.
Pulsed devices are not practical at a linear proton accelerator like those at Los Alamos or
the SNS, or a rapid-cycle machine like an FFAG, whose Megawatts of beam power could
prove advantageous for neutrino production[142]-[145], nor are they practical for “slow-spill”
beam experiments. Thus, DC-operated lenses are of advantage. Only brief mention shall be
made here.

show a net increase over a bare target beam of a factor of 4 with a 2.5 m long magnet carrying
20 A. Results of the calculated ﬁelds and several pion trajectories in this ﬁeld are shown in
Figure 29.

Solenoid Lens

As has been noted by many authors (e.g. [49]), a solenoid with axis of symmetry along
the proton beam and target direction has the eﬀect of transforming radial components of
momemntum into azimuthal (angular) momentum. So, while it prevents the secondary
beam from becoming larger, it does not by itself focus the secondaries toward a detector.
The focusing comes from producing a gradient in the solenoid ﬁeld. Ref. [92] shows results of
a tapered solenoid which produces a ﬁeld B(z) = B0/(1 + az), for example. As emphasized
in [151], the gradient provides the focusing through conservation of canonical momentum
( dP
dt )φ = d
c Aφ)] = 0. An advantage of this lens is that it is further from the direct
path of the beam, while a disadvantage is that it focuses both signs of secondaries. The
solenoid focuses certain pion (hence neutrino) momenta, which can be an advantage over a
broad-band beam [151].

cusing as they head into the decay tunnel. Taken from [46].

5 Focusing of Narrow-Band Beams

In many experiments it is desirable to produce fewer neutrinos with more carefully-selected
properties: for example, wide-band horn beams have large “wrong-sign” content (νµ’s in a
νµ beam). Or, it might be desirable to select neutrinos of a given energy for study of energy-
dependence of cross sections or neutrino oscillation phenomena at a particular neutrino
energy.

5.1 Dichromatic Beam

Fermilab was the ﬁrst to pioneer the so-called “di-chromatic neutrino beam” [147], and the
high event rates possible yielded rapid physics results [42, 43, 53]. Such a beam, shown
schematically in Figure 30, uses dipole magnets downstream of the target to sweep out
quickly wrong-sign secondaries from the neutrino channel. In the ﬁrst di-chromatic beam,
two quadrupole magnets were used to provide point-to-parallel focusing of those secondaries
of the momentum selected by the dipoles. The monochromatic secondary beam of pions and
kaons is sent into the decay tunnel, where they decay. Following the construction of the
SPS at CERN, a similar dichromatic beam was built there [123], with physics results coming
from the CDHS[54], and CHARM [18] detectors.

The term “di-chromatic” comes from the two distinct neutrino energies produced in such

a decay channel. The decay of a pion or kaon secondary results in a neutrino of energy

K radial bands shown separately [44].

where θ is the angle between the neutrino and meson direction, and γ = E(π,K)/m(π,K). The
momentum of the secondary beam is ﬁxed, but the presence of both pions and kaons lead to
two possible values for the neutrino energy. The possibility for oﬀ-angle decays of the (π, K)
beam can change Eν. Figure 31 shows this kinematical relationship in the Caltech-Fermilab
neutrino detector located 1300 feet from the end of the decay pipe: neutrino interactions
reconstructed in their detector at large transverse distances (i.e.: large (π, K) decay angles)
from the beam central axis show a smaller total energy deposition in the detector, though
two distinct bands are observed, arising from pion and kaon decays.

The channel downstream of the target starts producing neutrinos as soon as secondaries
decay. Decays before the momentum- and sign-selection are achieved result in a “wide-
band background” under the two energy peaks in Figure 31. For this reason, the proton
beam is brought onto the target at an angle oﬀ the axis of the decay tunnel, resulting in
such “wide-band” secondaries decaying preferentially away from the neutrino beam’s axis.
Further, momentum-deﬁning collimators are placed along the neutrino channel to better

eliminate oﬀ-momentum secondaries from the beam. In fact, these considerations, plus the
upgraded capabilities of running the Fermilab Main Ring at 400 GeV/c primary momentum,
led to an upgrade of this dichromatic beam [96, 97] with larger primary targeting angle to
reduce the wide-band backgrounds and better momentum selection to reduce wrong-sign
contamination.

5.2 Horn Beam with Plug

The wide-band horn-focused beam, referring to Figures 21 and 17, produces a span of neu-
trino energies corresponding to a variety of particle trajectories through the focusing system.
To cut oﬀ the largest range of neutrino energies, it is desirable to eliminate those particles
which travel through the ﬁeld-free “necks” of the horns. Such was attempted at CERN
[177, 58] by placing a Tungsten block (beam “plug”) at the end of the usual target to help
2/γπ).
attenuate those high energy pions which tend to leave the target at small angles (θπ ≈
The collimation for a narrow-band beam was reﬁned in a series of experiments at BNL
[75, 76], in which two beam plugs and a collimator located in between the horns were used
to attenuate all but the desired trajectories, as shown in Figure 32. Referring to Figure 17,
further eliminating those particles which do not cross the beam center line between the
two horns has the eﬀect of cutting all but the smallest momenta, as is achieved with the
collimator between the two horns in Figure 32. A similar proposal was made at Fermilab
[168].

5.3 Horn Beam with Dipole

As noted in [10], a dipole magnet placed in between the two horns of a wide-band beam
has the eﬀect of achieving better momentum and sign selection. As shown in Figure 33, a
dump for the primary beam must in this case be placed in the target hall, just like in the

39

dichromatic beam, which is somewhat of a challenge for high-intensity neutrino beams. In
practice, the aperture restriction of the dipole does attenuate some of the pion ﬂux.

The idea for an oﬀ-axis neutrino beam was ﬁrst proposed by BNL experiment E889 [50].
Many of the kinematic features of oﬀ-axis pion decay were worked out in Ref.
[185]. The
estimates of the on-axis WBB ﬂux in Section 4 made implicit use of the fact that the energies
of neutrinos emitted along the axis of travel of the secondary pion or kaon is linearly related
to the meson energy. The problem of achieving a particular energy NBB thus reduces to
focusing a particular energy meson beam.

In the limit that mesons are focused and travel parallel to the decay pipe axis, the BNL
E889 team noted that under some circumstances nearly all mesons of any energy could
contribute to generating the same energy of neutrino. While Equation 22 states that the
neutrino and meson energy are in fact linearly related for on-axis decays (θ = 0◦), the
relationship is more complex for neutrinos observed to emerge at some angle with respect
to the beam due to the denominator. Equation 22 is graphed for several particular decay
angles in Figure 34.

Figure 34 has an interesting interpretation:

for on-axis decays, the neutrino energy is
related to the meson energy. For oﬀ-axis decays, this relationship is weaker. Thus, for
large oﬀ-axis angles, nearly any pion energy makes about the same energy of neutrino. A
broad-band pion beam, therefore, can be used to generate a narrow-band neutrino spectrum.

The BNL team proposed such a NBB spectrum for a search for νµ →

νe oscillations,
since NC νµ interactions of any energy can leave small energy depositions in a detector
which mimic νe interactions. Thus, cutting down all νµ energies which contribute to NC
background is of value. They proposed placing a detector a couple of degrees oﬀ the beam
axis for their new beam line, thereby choosing the particular NBB energy to be achieved.

Figure 35 shows, for the beam conﬁguration and detector distance in the BNL proposal,
the neutrino energy spectrum from pion decays at several oﬀ-axis locations.
In addition
to the lower, narrower, energy spectrum at larger oﬀ-axis angles, it may be noted that, at
certain energies, the ﬂux at the peak actually exceeds the ﬂux at that same energy in the
on-axis case. Thus, the fact that all pions contribute to approximately the same neutrino
energy can, in part, compensate for the loss of ﬂux at oﬀ-axis angles, from Equation 9.

The proposal, not approved, has since been adopted by teams at JPARC [128] and
νe
Fermilab [170], which will employ the narrow-band oﬀ-axis beam to search for νµ →
oscillations. The ﬁrst detection of neutrinos from an oﬀ-axis beam is at Fermilab, where the
MiniBooNE detector is situated 110 mrad oﬀ-axis of the NuMI beam line at a distance of
750 m from the NuMI target. Neutrinos from NuMI have been observed in MiniBooNE
∼
[13]. The oﬀ-axis angle is suﬃciently large that both peaks from π and K decays can be
seen (see Figure 36), permitting use of the MiniBooNE detector to derive the π/K ratio of
the NuMI beam.15

15The ability to resolve separate pion and kaon peaks at large oﬀ-axis angles, as well as the low systematic

uncertainties in predicting the ﬂux of an oﬀ-axis beam were studied in [176].

280 m. This sets the scale for how long the decay tube should be if just 63% of the
pions for a 2 GeV neutrino beam are to be allowed to decay. As noted by [202], the decay
pipe radius is also of importance, and has to be as wide as practical for eﬃcient low neutrino
energy beams: in general low-energy pions are not as well focused in a horn focused beam,
and have a divergence which will send them into the decay volume walls before decaying.

Because scattering can do much to defocus the secondary beam already focused by the
horns, particular care is given to the entrance windows to decay volumes. The needs of
mechanical strength for the large evacuated chamber must be balanced against placing sig-
niﬁcant scattering material in the beam. NuMI’s 2 m diameter decay pipe has a composite
window with a 3 mm thick, 1 m diamter Aluminum center and thicker steel annulus at larger
radius to reduce pion scattering and heating from the unreacted proton beam. The CNGS
beam has a thin Ti window [101].

6.2 Hadron Hose

Fermilab proposed building a focusing device along the length of the decay pipe which
would enhance the neutrino ﬂux and reduce systematic uncertainties in predicting the energy
spectrum of neutrinos [127]. Based on the “beam guide” idea originally proposed by van der
Meer [201], the device consists of a single or multiple wires travelling axially down the length
of the decay volume which are pulsed with
1 kA of current, providing a weak toroidal ﬁeld,
but long focusing length (the full particle trajectory before decay). As indicated in Figure 39,
such focusing draws particles diverging toward the decay volume walls back toward the beam
center, where they can decay without absorption on the walls.

∼

The hadron hose can increase the neutrino event rate to experiments by 30-50% because
pions heading toward the decay pipe walls are drawn back toward the beam centerline.
Improved probability for pion decay can also be achieved simply by constructing a larger
diameter decay volume, but such is quite expensive due to the extensive shielding which
must surround the decay volume in high-power neutrino beams. Thus, the hadron hose may
be viewed as an active decay volume, a low-cost alternative to the large-diameter passive
decay volume.

The hadron hose provides a second beneﬁt which is less obvious: the spiral orbits essen-
tially randomizes the decay angles of the pions leading to neutrinos in the detector. This
is beneﬁcial for two-detector neutrino experiments, because the “near” and “far” detectors
often observe slightly diﬀerent energy spectra just due to the solid angle diﬀerence between
the two detectors. Recalling that the neutrino energy is Eν = (0.43Eπ)/(1 + γ2θ2), high

on the “beam guide” of van der Meer [201]. Secondary particles entering the decay volume

energy pions which decay just in front of the near detector can result in neutrinos hitting
the near detector for a wide span of angles θ, lowering the neutrino energy as compared to
the neutrinos reaching the far detector at θ
0. The randomization of decay angles, caused
by the spiraling orbits in the hose ﬁeld, is discussed further in Section 8.

≈

The focusing might naively be expected to converge all particles into the wire, causing
large absorptive losses of pions: pions emerge from the target in the radial direction, and
the radial restoring force causes many pion trajectories to cross the wire. However, multiple
Coulomb scattering of the pions and kaons in the upstream horns and entrance window to
the decay volume leads to some azimuthal component of pion momentum, causing the pions
to enter the decay volume and execute spiral orbits around the hose wire [162], as indicated
schematically in Figure 39. Analytic expressions for particle orbits in the hadron hose ﬁeld
have been computed [187, 162].

Placing a high-current wire in the evacuated decay volume poses some technical chal-
lenges, as discussed in [127]. Namely, the wire’s heat induced by I 2R as well as energy
deposition from beam particles must be dissipated suﬃciently by blackbody radiation, the
wire’s voltage must be shown not to break down in the heavily ionized residual gas of the
decay volume, and the long-term tension applied to the wire segments must be ensured not
to cause plastic ﬂow (“creep”) of the wire material such that a failure occurs.

The ﬁrst neutrino experiment in fact had to lower the AGS accelerator energy to 15 GeV to

origninal neutrino line at Fermilab, which had an earthen “berm” suﬃcient to stop muons up
to 200 GeV/c, had to be reinforced with 20 m of lead and 140 m of steel shielding following
upgrades of the accelerator complex to run at 800-900 GeV proton energy [74].

The idea of a moving beam dump (see Figure 37) will be employed by MiniBooNE to
demonstrate their νe’s come from oscillated νµ’s from pion decay, not the “instrinsic” νe from
πeνe decays or µ decays. The moving beam dump was ﬁrst employed
the beam of K

in the shielding. Figure 1 shows a lead block that was placed close to the target to stop

Low-intensity beam lines combined the proton beam dump with the muon ﬁlter [58, 40].
However, for modern beam lines, a dedicated proton dump is required because of the intense
beam power. The NuMI beam, for example, is designed for a 400 kW proton beam, of which
70 kW heads for the beam dump, requiring water cooling, a special Aluminum core, etc.

Figure 41: Plan view of the CERN PS neutrino beam from, taken from [58]. A small
mercury-ﬁlled tube in the muon shield could be drained temporarily, exposing the down-
stream neutrino detectors to muons from the beam for calibration.

Accident conditions are even more problematic: the beam stop must allow for errant proton
beam missing the target and striking the dump directly. This is an even greater concern for
upgrades to NuMI, CNGS, and JPARC, the latter two of which will use a graphite core.

A common problem in muon shielding is leakage, not attenuation [181]. Staggered assem-
bly with no “line of sight” cracks is crucial to good shielding design. This uniformity impacts
the ability of downstream muon instrumentation to make meaningful measurements of muon
intensity and lateral proﬁle. Such measurements, which can provide information on the neu-
trino ﬂux and even the energy spectrum, are distorted by cracks which let lower-energy
muons through, as has been observed at NuMI.

There have been a couple clever trickes to temporarily “let down” the muon shield of
an experiment for the purposes of calibrating the neutrino detectors with particles (muons,
pions) of known momentum. The Serpukov beam could calibrate its spark chamber and
bubble chamber experiments [35] using a small channel in their shielding at an angle 87◦ to
the primary beam axis. Shown in Figure 40, this channel permits secondaries from the target
to be focused in a quadrupole-dipole system and be delivered directly to the experiments.
Such a calibration test beam was also utilized by the NuTeV experiment at Fermilab [119].
Another trick employed at the CERN PS neutrino beam in 1967 was to install a mecury-ﬁlled
tube which penetrated the entire 20 m muon shield [177], shown in Figure 41. The mercury
from this tube could temporarily be drained, exposing the heavy-liquid bubble chamber
(HLBC) from Ecole Polytechnique to muons at the end of the decay volume.

7 Flux Monitoring

7.1 Primary Beam Monitoring

The monitoring of the primary proton beam, as far as it impacts the physics of a neutrino
experiment, is limited to requiring knowledge of the proton beam just upstream of the
target. Speciﬁcally, paramters such as the total intensity of the beam striking the target
(both integrated over the lifetime of the experiment and on a per-pulse basis, since many
experiments suﬀer rate-dependent eﬀects), the position, angle, divergence and spot size of
the beam as it is about to strike the target.

∼

(1

The proton ﬂux delivered to the neutrino target can be measured in a variety of ways.
Fast-extracted beams can use current toroids, and NuMI has recently demonstrated cali-
2)% over the ﬁrst year of operation using precision test
bration of such a device to
currents. In the past, many experiments would often take their normalization from foil acti-
vation techniques, which measured the residual activity of gold [47], Aℓ [177], or polyethylene
[67] foils placed in the proton beam upstream of the target. Such techniques are typically
precise to (5
10)%, due to imprecise knowledge of production cross-sections for these ra-
dionuclides. One motivation for using such foil techniques was to better match what the
hadron production experiments did for proton normalization [47], but this is becoming less
imporatant as experiments are relying on more than one hadron production experiment.

−

−

The proton beam proﬁle has in various lines been measured by segmented ionization
chambers [40, 15, 76, 50], Aluminum SEMs [102], W wire SEMs [198], ZnS screens[177, 47,
68]. Many of these techniques no longer work in high-power neutrino lines: the large proton
ﬂuences motivate the need to reduce beam scattering and loss along transport line, as these
cause irradiation and damage to transport line magnets. Further, the proton beam’s power
can signiﬁcantly degrade the performance of an interceptive device in the beam. At NuMI,
the proﬁle is measured at the target with a segmented foil Secondary Emission Monitor
(SEM) [137].

7.2 Secondary Beam Monitors

Instrumentation placed directly in the secondary (π, K) beam of a wide-band beam is rel-
atively rare, since it must cope with quite high rates and can substantially aﬀect the neu-
trino ﬂux. A few notable examples exist. CERN proposed placing a spectrometer and
Cherenkov counter system downstream of their horns to measure π/K ﬂuxes after the horn
focusing.[180]. Such was a “destructive measurement,” from the point of view of neutrino
running, but would have yielded an in situ analysis of hadron production and focusing. In
Figure 41, this spectrometer is indicated by the Cherenkov counter just below (beam left) of
the muon ﬁlter tilting at an angle which points back to a thin specrometer magnet (curved,
in front of the horn R2). A test of this system was conducted [182], though backgrounds
from δ-rays in the beam and produced in the spectrometer appear to have been diﬃcult.

KEK placed a Cherenkov counter, shown in Figure 42, in their secondary beam for two
brief periods during their run [15, 158]. This system placed a wedge-shaped sherical mirror

approximately the location of the maximal ﬂux (see Figure 51).

away from circuit board technology as in [80] to all-ceramic/metal design [138]. Because of
the large ﬂuxes of photons, electrons, positrons, and neutrons in the secondary beam, neither
chamber was used in a ﬂux measurement. The BNL chambers were placed midway down the
decay volume, while the NuMI chambers were located right upstream of the beam absorber.
In the case of the NuMI beam, the ﬂux at the hadron monitor is dominated by unreacted
protons passing through the target, so the device serves as a useful monitor of the proton
beam targeting, as well as a check of the integrity of the target. The CERN WANF beam
[28, 123] had split-foil SEMs downstream of the target but upstream of the horns to ensure
beam was on target, and the CNGS beam will do likewise [101].

The dichromatic beam at Fermilab had an elaborate secondary beam system which was
crucial for making ﬂux measurements and which enabled absolute neutrino cross sections to
be measured. The narrow, momentum-selected secondary beam permits reasonably small-

diameter instruments to be inserted or removed from the secondary beam. These detectors
included two ion chambers which measured total particle ﬂux, an RF cavity which was
used to corroborate the ion chamber measurement, and a Cherenkov counter which could be
scanned in pressure to measure the relative abundance of e, π, K, p in the beam (subsequently
normalized to the total ﬂux determined by the ion chambers). With this system in place, it
was not, in principle, important to know the number of protons delivered to the target in
order to estimate the neutrino ﬂux.

The ion chambers were carefully calibrated. Linearity with particle ﬂux was demonstrated
by comparison to the proton ﬂuence on target measured by a beam current toroid. Stability
in time was shown by comparions to the two ion chambers’ relative signals. Studies were
done to show that material upstream of the ion chambers contributed negligible signal in
the form of δ-rays (the ion chambers were placed well-downstream of any shielding), and
the signal response was carefully studied as a function of relative particle abundances, since
heavy protons cause a rise in signal due to nuclear interactions in the ion chamber materials.

known momentum bite of the dichromatic channel, allows absolute ﬂux predictions which
can then be compared with the event rates in Figure 31 to derive cross sections, independent
of knowledge of protons on target.

7.3 Muon Beam Monitoring

There are two kinds of muon systems that have been built: ﬂux measuring systems and di-
agnostic systems. Flux monitors attempt to use the tertiary muons to yield a measurement
of the neutrino ﬂux. This is a plausible idea, since muons come from same decays as the
neutrinos. Not all beamline geometries are conducive to such ﬂux measurements, however,
because of either decay kinematics or because the shielding imposes limitations on the frac-
tions of the muon ﬂux visible to the muon detectors. First, the muon detectors must be
placed downstream in the muon ﬁlter, imposing a lower threshold of muon momentum and
thereby cutting oﬀ direct measurement of the lowest part of the neutrino energy spectrum.
Second, the solid angle acceptance of such muon detectors (even in absence of intervening
shielding), can be prohibitively small, especially at low energy where pion decays are wider
angle and may not intercept the muon detectors at the end of the decay volume. Diagnostic
muon monitor systems may be similar to ﬂux monitors, but access a smaller fraction of the
muon spectrum. They must, however, be available “online” during neutrino running, which
poses diﬀerent constraints in terms of simplicity of construction and radiation tolerance.

While the ﬁrst neutrino experiments at BNL and CERN did not in any way measure
their neutrino ﬂux, the follow-on experimental run at BNL[66] did so, and was the ﬁrst
attempt to measure a neutrino ﬂux using the tertiary muons. Emulsions were placed in

seven “probe holes” in the steel shielding at the end of the decay region, each probe hole
containing up to four emulsions at diﬀerent transverse distances to the beam axis. Since the
experiment had no focusing of the neutrino parents, this measurement, in the limit of no
multiple scattering in the steel, should help corroborate their neutrino ﬂux calculation. The

experimenters report an error (20
phase space sampled by the emulsions in the steel and the inability to go below a certain
threshold (steel thickness) for fear of backgrounds from upstream hadrons. Their ﬂux data
is shown in Figure 45. This tuning was done using a short run with a 3” Be target to allow
comparison with the existing thin-target hadroproduction data and with a 12” Be target
which was used during the neutrino run.

−

CERN subsequently measured its neutrino spectrum using muon system measurements
[58]. There are multiple challenges: (1) they re-parameterized Sanford-Wang from this ﬁt, so
have to hope thick target eﬀects simply scale the ﬂux, not modify it; (2) focusing eﬀects have
minimal eﬀect on the spectrum; (3) muons from K decays only easily distinguished at large
lateral oﬀsets from beam axis, so have to assume π/K ratio from external ‘beam survey’ data
16; (4) the ﬁrst few meters of shielding have large hadron shower content, so one must only

∼

The large ﬂux of δ rays produced in the muon ﬁlter shielding makes ﬂux measurements
in a wide band beam quite challenging [121, 12]. Charge-integrating detectors like solid
state detectors or ionization chambers will measure a combination of muon signal and δ-
ray background. As shown in the left plot of Figure 47, the electron component can be a

[23], and at the higher energies there the K/π ratio uncertainty seems to be a bigger eﬀect.

17Unfortunately for present-day beams, this method may not be easily applicable at high-intensity neutrino
beams. Higher intensities have required thicker beam stops to absorb hadronic showers from the remnant
proton beam, and the neutrino energies (hence muon momenta) of interest have decreased for long-baseline
neutrino oscillation searches.

signiﬁcant fraction of the signal and has a diﬀerent lateral shape than the muon beam due
to multiple scattering of the electrons. CERN employed a series of emulsions to count the
tracks as well as the scattering angle of each track (straight-through tracks are presumably
from beam muons while wide-angle tracks are from knock-on electrons), thereby obtaining
a µ/e “correction factor” by which future muon measurements are adjusted. Thus, absolute
ﬂux measurements are limited to 3-5% due to the counting in emulsions and the ability to
separate electrons from muons.

The technologies employed for muon monitors vary, though they must become increas-
ingly simple and radiation-hard as the intensities increase and the ability to access these
remote muon pits is reduced.
Ionization chambers were used in horn-focused wide-band
beams such as the CERN PS neutrino beam [58, 177], the BNL neutrino beam [80],the
IHEP-Serpukhov beam [65], the KEK neutrino beam [124, 15], the Fermilab NuTeV beam
[216], the Fermilab NuMI beam [138], and the CERN CNGS [101]. Solid state muon detec-
tors were used in the CERN West Area Neutrino Facility (WANF) beam line oﬀ the SPS
107/cm2/spill
[79, 122, 123]. Maximum muon rates ranged from 5
[138]. ANL [90], CERN [58], and Serpukhov [40] had plastic scintillators in the downstream
portion muon shield, where particle ﬂuxes are lower

105/cm2/spill [58] to 5

1/cm2/spill).

Muon monitor systems have done real diagnostic work: the CERN muon chambers at
the PS neutrino line detected a ﬂux asymmetry which was eventually traced to a magnetic
ﬁeld asymmetry in the horn [95]. Also at CERN, a misalignment of some of the target

hall components was detected at the WANF line: they could achieve higher muon ﬂuxes
if they readjusted target and horn positions using motorize mounts [77]. At NuTeV [216],
the monitors demonstrated the alignment of the neutrino beam, necessary for the desired
precision in sin2 θW . The NuMI secondary beam monitors detected misalignment of the
target which, if uncorrected, could have been catastrophic: the proton beam was initially
aimed toward the target’s edge [219], which can cause stress on the target ﬁns. The NuMI
chambers also diagnosed a failure in the target which caused it to ﬁll with cooling water
[138]. For long-baseline experiments, the muon monitors are essential to demonstrate that
the neutrino beam points to the remote neutrino detector within the required accuracy, as
demonstrated at KEK [15].

The MiniBooNE beam has a spectrometer system, the “Little Muon Counter” (LMC),
placed 7◦ oﬀ-axis to its decay pipe (see Figure 37). The spectrometer has an upstream
collimator to deﬁne the 7◦ angle of muons exiting the decay volume, and a small tracking
system to measure muon momenta exiting the collimator. The experiment, which is designed
νe oscillations, beneﬁts from direct measurements of intrinsic νe content in
to search for νµ →
the beam, such as originates from µ decays or Ke3 decays. While the former are constrained
by measurements of the νµ ﬂux in the MiniBooNE detector, the Ke3 decays require separate
knowledge about the K/π ratio oﬀ the MiniBooNE target. Figure 48 shows the result of a
Monte Carlo calculation [120], in the absence of backgrounds from neutrons, conversions, or
resolution eﬀects from scattering in the collimator, of what would be expected in the LMC
spectrometer.

8 Two-Detector Experiments

Two-detector experiments were pioneered at Fermilab (see Figure 49) and CERN (see Fig-
ure 50) for the purpose of studying neutrino oscillations. Downstream of the neutrino beam,
a “near” detector measures directly the energy spectrum of neutrinos from the beam. A
second detector measures the energy spectrum of neutrinos which have propagated for some
time interval. The distance to the second detector is presumably long compared to the time
to arrive at the ﬁrst detector. Deviations between the two energy spectra may be used to
infer the presence of neutrino oscillations, which manifest themselves as the disappearance
of the νµ beam [196, 55, 15, 161], or the appearance of a diﬀerent neutrino ﬂavor in the νµ
beam (eg: [14]). The direct measurement of the ﬂux in the ﬁrst detector greatly reduces the
need to calculate the beam spectrum, improving the experiments’ sensitivity. More recently,
long-baseline experiments have searched for oscillations across distances of order 100’s of km,
as pioneered at KEK; such has required use of accurate GPS to locate the two separated
detectors [169].

8.1 Calculating the Extrapolated Beam Flux

Even in the absence of oscillations, the energy spectra in the two detectors are are diﬀerent,
and the diﬀerences must be calculated so that a “near-to-far” extrapolation of that spectrum
observed in the near detector can be computed. A comparison of the expected energy spectra
in the KEK beam at znear = 300 m (“near detector”) and at zfar = 250 km (“far detector”)
is shown in Figure 51. The spectra are diﬀerent, not simply scaleable by the ratio of the

Equation 23 is a simpliﬁcation, since not all decaying pions produce neutrinos within the
ﬁnite acceptances of the detectors and not all pions are able to decay before interacting along
the decay pipe walls. Furthermore, the signiﬁcant acceptance diﬀerences between the near
and far detectors are a function of the energy of the pion (hence neutrino), as is indicated
schematically in Figure 52. Fast pions tend to live longer and decay downstream in the

in a neutrino arriving at the far detector, aﬀecting the neutrino energy at each detector in
Equation 22. Additionally, pions of diﬀerent momenta enter the decay volume with diﬀerent
angular divergences. For an unfocused beam, such as used in the CERN experiments, the
2/γ = 2mπ/Eπ. Such diﬀerences in angles of entry
pion angle leaving the target is θ
in the decay pipe result (for low-energy pions) in wider-angle decays to reach the neutrino
detectors, and also greater likelihood of striking the decay volume walls. Even for a horn-
focused beam, pions of diﬀerent momenta will have varying divergences depending upon the
exact tune of the focusing system, and some pions will be unfocused due to the zero-ﬁeld
inner-apertures (“necks”) of the horns, as shown in Figure 21.

The calculation of

RFN requires a Monte Carlo, as shown in Figure 53 for the NuMI
beam. The Monte Carlo prediction departs sharply from the idealized curve of Equation 23,
particularly for very high energy neutrinos (which come from unfocused parent mesons),

but also at two other distinct values near Eν ≈
8 GeV. Inspection of
Figure 21 reveals that these energies are the transition points at which pions no longer pass
through horn 1 or horn 2, respectively, of the NuMI focusing system. Changes in focusing,
or the absence of focusing, causes the departure from the idealized curve. Uncertainties
5)%, well below the
in the extrapolated far detector ﬂux are typically at the level of (2
uncertainty in direct prediction of the ﬂux (which range from (20
100)% just from hadron
production alone), as discussed in Section 8.2. Thus, the two-detector experiment serves to
reduce the uncertainty in the prediction of the “far detector’s” energy spectrum.

Two proposals have been developed to make the far and near detector spectra more
similar, requiring less sophisticated calculation of
RFN. The T2K collaboration [131], noting
that the structure in
RFN results from the large angular acceptance of the near detector,
proposed placing a near detector further from their beam line, at z = 2000 m, large compared
to the 130 m long beam line. The NuMI hadron hose proposal [127] (see Section 6.2) was
developed in part as a means to remove the angular correlations between the near and far
detectors, thereby the energy diﬀerence resulting from Equation 22. The spiraling orbits
in the hose ﬁeld randomize the decay angles to the 2 detectors, as well as keep particles
away from the decay pipe walls so they can continue to follow the pion lifetime curve of
Equation 23 [136]. The results from these two ideas are shown in Figures 54 and 55,
respectively. Both proposals are quite eﬀective in removing some of the complexity of the
near-to-far extrapolation calculation.

Figure 56: The diﬀerence in the energy of the neutrino that a given pion would emit toward
the far detector to that it would emit toward the near detector in NuMI/MINOS in the low-
energy (left) and high-energy (right) beams, normalized to the near detector energy. Curves
are shown with and without the focusing of the Hadron Hose proposal. Taken from [127].

That the decay angles to the ND and FD are substantially diﬀerent is demonstrated in
Figure 56. In this ﬁgure is shown, for each pion focused in the NuMI beam, the ratio of the
neutrino energy created by that pion if the neutrino strikes the center of the near detector
at z = 1040 m to the energy of the neutrino created by that same pion if it strikes the
far detector at z = 735.4 km. Because of the wide array of decay angles which can strike
the near detector, particularly for high-energy particles decaying at the downstream end of
the decay pipe, the energy spectrum in the near detector is systematically lower in the ND
than the FD. With the inclusion of the Hadron Hose, the ratio of energy spectra at the two
detectors becomes more symmetric.

The systematic diﬀerence in decay angles motivated another technique [197] employed for
analysis of data from the NuMI beam [161] which permits some correction for the near-far
diﬀerence in energy spectra. Noting that a pion decay which gives rise to an energy EN D
in the ND actually gives rise to a neutrino energy EF D
in the FD, a matrix was developed
which describes the relationship between the energies EN D

and EF D

where φF D
is the ﬂux of neutrinos in the jth energy bin in the FD and φN D
is the ﬂux of
neutrinos in the ith energy bin in the ND. Equation 24 provides a more accurate prediction
of the ﬂux of neutrinos in the FD given a measurement of the φN D
in the ND. Conceptually,
the matrix is similar to a point-spread function: a particular ﬂux of neutrinos bin of energy
i in the ND contributes to several bins j in the FD.

The matrix elements Mij is shown graphically in Figure 57. As noted in the scale, the
values of Mij are typically of order (znear/zf ar)2 = (1/735.4)2. The histograms show energy
spectra in the ND and FD. As expected, the matrix departs from a diagonal matrix at
large neutrino energies, which arise from high-momentum pions decaying closer to the ND.

Also shown in Figure 57 are the energy spectra calculated in the ND and FD. For illus-
tration, a set of neutrino energies are highlighted in the ND spectrum, and the corresponding
neutrino energies from the same meson decays are indicated in the FD. A single neutrino en-
ergy measured in the ND must, because of decay kinematics, contribute to the ﬂux prediction
for several energy bins in the the FD. Such is the advantage of the matrix method.

8.2 Systematic Uncertainties

This section is not intended to be a full list of all systematic uncertainties for all two-
detector experiments, nor of all possible techniques which can be used to limit them. Surely
these will change over time. Rather, the ﬁgures shown here are meant to demonstrate where
systematics appear in the spectrum and what kind of information is helpful in limiting them.
The NuMI beam will be used as a basis for discussion.

8.2.1 Hadron Production Uncertainties

Hadron production data may not exist for a neutrino experiment’s target material, thickness,
beam energy, or relevant portion of (xF , pT ) phase space. Prior to 2006, such was the case
for NuMI (two-interaction length Carbon target, struck by p0=120 GeV/c protons).

Figure 58 shows the (xF , pT ) of π+ which contribute to the NuMI νµ energy spectrum
in either the LE or HE beam conﬁgurations. As can be seen, the LE beam conﬁguration
250 MeV/c. The tail at higher pz and low pT
focuses pions of pz ∼

10 GeV/c with pT ∼

comes from unfocused pions which pass through the ﬁeld-free necks of the horns. The HE
beam focuses pions of pz ∼
In the ﬁgure is also shown the data points acquired by high-energy hadron production
experiments. Only Barton’s data is on Carbon, and none are at the correct beam momentum
or are a thick target measurement. Less constraint is available for HE focusing region, and
this must be entrusted to hadron production models to extrapolate. No data is available for
the high energy tail of either of these beams at pT ≈
0. Inspection of Figure 59 shows that
these regions with little experimental constraint have sizeable model dependence of the ﬂux
calculations. The variation amongst various models’ predictions is
20% in the LE beam
and

∼
For a two detector experiment, the uncertainty of relevance is in the far/near ratio, since
the near detector ﬂux is measured directly and is used to estimate the far detector ﬂux.
Further, the F/N uncertainties, in general smaller than for the direct ﬂux calculation, are
only large near the “edges” of the focusing system. If all particles were perfectly focused,
then hadron production uncertainties would amount to only a rate uncertainty in either
detector. It is the residual divergence of the beam that results in near-far diﬀerences, and
such arise only at the limits of the focusing or in the high energy tail, where there is no
focusing. Thus, in Figure 53 the largest far/near uncertainties (indicated by the vertical
sizes of the boxes) appear at Eν = 6 GeV, Eν = 8 GeV, or above Eν > 12 GeV. Beamlines
with complete focusing for all energies would therefore be anticipated to have reduced model
dependence of the F/N calculation, such as the Hadron Hose in Figure 55.

charged-current event rate at the ﬁrst detector at z = 1040 m. The box sizes are proportional
to the probability of the pion resulting in a CC interaction in the ND. The 6 plots correspond
to the 6 beam conﬁgurations which have been run: LE10/170kA (top left), LE10/185kA
(top middle), LE10/200kA (top right), LE100/200kA (bottom left), LE250/200kA (bottom
middle), LE10/0kA (bottom right) – where each conﬁguration is designated by the number
of centimeters by which the target is upstream of the horn and by the current in the horns.
As is evident, each beam conﬁguration samples diﬀerent region of (xF , pT ). Taken from [178].

For NuMI, it was possible to tune the Monte Carlo hadron production model in (xF , pT )
to better agree with the near detector energy spectrum by virtue of simultaneously ﬁtting
data accumulated in several beam energy conﬁgurations [161], lowering the uncertainty in
the prediction of the far detector spectrum. Similar tuning was used by neutrino experiments
at BNL [16], NOMAD [28] and NuTeV [152, 217], but the NuMI capability to vary target
position as well as horn current provides additional information. In brief, variation of the
horn current changes the pT kick received by particles through the horn (hence the
of
the focusing), while the target position dictates the mean xF being focused, as discussed
in Section 4. Several focusing uncertainties depend only on pz or xF of focused particles,
as discussed in the next section, so the ability to control both xF and pT helps disentangle
hadron production and other focusing eﬀects. Figure 60 shows the (pT , xF ) sampled by
several NuMI beam conﬁgurations.

8.2.2 Focusing Uncertainties

Several common systematic uncertainties manifest themselves in the detector ﬂux prediction
or the far/near calculation. Figure 61 shows some of the larger uncertainties for the NuMI
LE beam conﬁguration:

Number of protons on target: two precision toroids, each calibrated by precision
current sources, were tracked throughout the run against each other and the toroid reading
the current in the accelerator. A precision of <2% was achieved.

Proton beam halo scraping on upstream collimating baﬄes can yield pions from a
diﬀerent target location than the nominal target location, and these pions can enter the
focusing system, contributing high-energy neutrinos. Proton halo was measured by primary
beam instrumentation to be < 0.2% in magnitude.

The absolute current in the horns was calibrated by precision toroids around the

stripline to

0.5%.

±

The current pulse in the horn is

1 msec, at which the skin depth in Aluminum is
δ = 7 mm, larger than the 3 mm thickness of the horn conductor. The distribution of
the current in the conductors is therefore not a simple exponential, and the uncertainty on
this distribution aﬀects strongly those pions which graze and have considerable pathlength
through the conductor material.

∼

Misalignments of the horns result in smaller-angle pions, not normally intercepted by
the horns, receiving some focusing. Such changes the spectrum for those pions at exactly
the angles near the horn necks.

9 Summary

The present article summarized elements of particle production and focusing to derive con-
ventional neutrino beams. With 40 years of innovative advances, neutrino beams have gone
from exploratory devices whose ﬂux and composition was known little better than natural
neutrino sources to instruments able to predict neutrino ﬂuxes at the experiments at the few
percent level. Further, the power of neutrino beams has risen from a few detected neutrino
interactions per week to a few detected interactions per second.

In the coming years, new facilities will push the technological challenges of neutrino beams
further. Studies of neutrino oscillations across long baselines of hundreds of kilometers will
be conducted at the CERN CNGS, Fermilab NuMI, and JPARC-nu facilities. Probing rare
νe oscillations, CP violation in the lepton sector, or the appearance
transitions such as νµ →
of the ντ in a νµ beam will require sophisticated focusing systems capable of coping with
Megawatts of protons delivered to these facilities over several years. Further, precision
cross-section experiments being conducted at the Fermilab-MiniBooNE or NuMI beam lines
or the JPARC-nu beam line will demand accurate demonstration of the neutrino ﬂuxes and
composition.

With many exciting ﬁelds of physics to be probed using the neutrino, we may look forward

to continuing advances in beam line systems to realize these goals.

A Kinematic Relations

This appendix reproduces several useful kinematic formulae relating to the energy and decay
distribution of neutrino daughters from pion and kaon parents. More thorough review of
relativistic kinematics can be found in [118], and numerous formulae relevant for neutrino
beams can be found in [185].

Problem Set

1. Assume a “half-horn” with an inner-conductor which is partially tapered and at z = f is
perpendicular to the z axis, as in Figure 64. We will calculate the trajectory of a particle
of momentum p through such a horn but not resort to the “thin lens” approximation
that the pathlength s through the horn is small compared to the distance zin from the
particle source (target) to the horn.

(a) Show that, if the particle enters the horn at a coordinate (zin, rin), its trajectory

through the horn is given by

r = rinexp[A0(cos θ

cos θin)]

2. This problem concerns the wide-band focusing properties of quadrupole magnets.

(a) Show that the focal length of a quadrupole of length L, aperture a, and maximum

ﬁeld B0 (in Tesla) at the pole tip, acting on a momentum p (in GeV/c) is

f =

.

The magnetic potential of a quadrupole is conveniently expressed as φ = B0
(b) Show that the net focal length of a pair of identical quadrupoles, one focusing

a xy.

and the next defocusing, and separated by a distance d, is

f ∗ =

It is most practical to use transfer matrices which act on vectors (x x′), and ﬁrst
derive the transfer matrix for a drift space of length d and the focusing or defo-
cusing quadrupole. The three matrices multiplied together gives the net transfer
matrix, which contains the focal length. Assume the thin lens approximation.

(c) Prove Equation 16

(d) Prove Equation 19 in the limit that a << R and u << D.

3. Suppose you are an experimenter on the MiniBooNE team. Following the example
of [84], you are about to place a temporary beam dump (see Figure 37) in the decay
tunnel to stop a number of mesons and thereby test your beam ﬂux prediction. By
what fraction should the νµ ﬂux change? The νe ﬂux? Assume that half of νe’s come
from K decay and half from µ decay for this experiment. Important information: the
MiniBooNE decay pipe is 50 m, the temporary dump is at 25 m, and the νµ focusing
peak is

800 MeV.

(b) Use your result above to show that the energy distribution in the lab of neutrinos

from pion or kaon decays is ﬂat in neutrino energy, i.e.

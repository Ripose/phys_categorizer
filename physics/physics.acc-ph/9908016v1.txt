DISCUSSION ON MUON COLLIDER PARAMETERS AT CENTER OF
MASS ENERGIES FROM 0.1 TEV TO 100 TEV

Bruce J. King, Brookhaven National Laboratory 1

Abstract

Some of the potential capabilities and design challenges of
muon colliders are illustrated using self-consistent collider
parameter sets at center of mass energies ranging from 0.1
TeV to 100 TeV.

1

INTRODUCTION

The main motivation for research and development efforts
on muon collider technology is the assertion that affordably
priced muon colliders might provide lepton-lepton colli-
sions at much higher center of mass (CoM) energies than is
feasible for electron colliders, and perhaps eventually ex-
plore the spectrum of elementary particles at mass scales
inaccessible even to hadron colliders.

This paper attempts to present some justiﬁcation for
these assertions through discussion and evaluation of the
self-consistent muon collider parameter sets given in table
1, at CoM energies ranging from 0.1 to 100 TeV.

The parameter set at 0.1 TeV CoM energy was included
as a lower energy reference point and was constrained to es-
sentially reproduce one of the sets of parameters currently
under study[1] by the Muon Collider Collaboration (MCC).
In contrast, the other parameter sets represent speculation
by the author on how the parameters might evolve with
CoM energy and they have not been studied or discussed
in detail within the MCC.

2 GENERATION OF PARAMETER SETS

The parameter sets in table 1 were generated through it-
erative runs of a stand-alone FORTRAN program, LUM-
CALC. The parameter sets are calculated from the input
values for several input parameters – namely, the CoM en-
ergy (ECoM), the collider ring circumference (C) and depth
below the Earth’s surface (D), the beam momentum spread
(δ) and 6-dimensional invariant emittance (ǫ6N), the refer-
ence pole-tip magnetic ﬁeld for the ﬁnal focus quadrupoles
(B4σ), and the time until the beams are dumped (tD) – and
from the input of maximum allowable values for several
other parameters – namely, the bunch repetition frequency
(fb), the initial number of muons per bunch (N0), the beam-
beam tune disruption parameter (∆ν), the beam divergence
at the interaction point (σθ), the maximum aperture for the
ﬁnal focus quadrupoles (A±4σ), and maximum allowable
neutrino radiation where the plane of the collider ring cuts
the Earth’s surface.

As a preliminary stage of calculation, LUMCALC
makes any parameter adjustments that may be required to
satisfy the input constraints. These are, in order: 1) reduc-
ing σθ to the limit imposed by A±4σ (based on scaling to
existing ﬁnal focus designs at 0.1 TeV and 4 TeV[1]), 2)
reducing N0 to attain an acceptable ∆ν, and 3) reducing fb
until the neutrino radiation is acceptable.

The output luminosity may be derived in terms of the

input parameters as:

L[cm−2.s−1] = 2.11 × 1033 × HB × (1 − e−2tD[γτµ])
× fb[s−1](N0[1012])2(ECoM[TeV])3

This formula uses the standard MCC assumption[1] that the
ratio of transverse to longitudinal emittances can be chosen
in the muon cooling channel to maximize the luminosity
for a given ǫ6N. The pinch enhancement factor, HB, is very
close to unity (see table 1), and the numerical coefﬁcient
in equation 1 includes a geometric correction factor of 0.76
for the non-zero bunch length, σz = β∗ (the “hourglass
effect”) .

3 DISCUSSION

The physics motivation for each of the parameter sets in ta-
ble 1 is discussed in [2]. Brieﬂy, the number of µµ → ee
events gives a benchmark estimate of the discovery poten-
tial for elementary particles at the full CoM energy of the
collider, while the production of hypothesized 100 GeV
Higgs particles indicates roughly how the colliders would
perform in studying physics at this ﬁxed energy scale.

Further information on the important issue of neutrino
radiation can be found in [3]. The numbers given in table
1 come from an analytical calculation that is not intended
to be accurate at much better than an order of magnitude
level and that is deliberately conservative, i.e. it may well
overestimate the radiation levels. The radiation levels are
predicted to rise approximately as the cube of the collider
energy if other relevant parameters are held ﬁxed (up to
some mitigating factors that come into play at the highest
energies), rapidly becoming a serious design constraint for
colliders at the TeV scale and above.

The 1 TeV parameter set of table 1 would give about the
same luminosity as, for example, the design for the pro-
posed NLC linear electron collider at the same energy, and
the physics motivation and capabilities might be relatively
similar[2,4]. Placement of the collider at 125 meters depth
reduces the average neutrino radiation in the collider plane

to less than one thousandth of the U.S. federal off-site ra-
diation limit (1 mSv/year, which is of the same order of
magnitude as the typical background radiation from natu-
ral causes). Nevertheless, attention would still need to be
paid to minimizing the length, L, of any straight sections
with low beam divergence, since these produce radiation
hotspots with intensity proportional to L[3].

The 4 TeV parameter set was chosen as being at about
the highest energy that is practical for a “ﬁrst generation”
muon collider on an existing laboratory site, due to neutrino
radiation, and the muon current has been reduced to lower
the radiation to the same level as the 1 TeV parameter set,
accepting the consequent loss in luminosity.

The 4 TeV parameters may be compared to the MCC 4
TeV design presented at Snowmass’96[5], which did not
take account of the neutrino radiation issue and hence at-
tained a luminosity higher by more than an order of mag-
nitude. The lower bunch repetition rate of the current 4
TeV parameter set makes some of the design parameters
more relaxed than in the Snowmass design, particularly in
allowing a “lite front end” with relaxed rate speciﬁcations:
the proton driver, pion production target and cooling chan-
nel. On the other hand, the desire to recover some of the
lost luminosity motivates collider ring parameters that are
slightly more aggressive, especially β∗ (3 mm reduced to
1.2 mm) and σθ (0.9 mrad increased to 1.6 mrad). This
entails a more difﬁcult ﬁnal focus design and also a more
difﬁcult task to shield the detector region from muon decay
backgrounds.

Beyond CoM energies of a few TeV, it is probably neces-
sary to build the colliders at isolated sites where the public
would not be exposed to the neutrino radiation disk. These
will presumably be “second generation” machines, arriv-
ing after the technology of muon colliders has been estab-
lished in one or more smaller and less expensive machines
built at existing HEP laboratories. The gain from being
able to relax the neutrino radiation constraint is evident in
the 10 TeV parameter set, with an exciting luminosity of
1.0 × 1036cm−2.s−1 at several times the discovery mass
reach of the LHC hadron collider.

p

From the progression of the parameter sets it is clear that
the ﬁnal focus design will become progressively more dif-
ﬁcult with rising CoM energy. Consider, for example, the
βmax/β∗, a dimension-
overall beam demagniﬁcation,
less parameter that should be closely correlated with frac-
tional tolerances in magnet uniformity, residual chromatic-
ity etc. For the 10 TeV example, this has risen to approxi-
mately 31 000 in both the x and y coordinates, which – as
a very crude comparison that ignores considerable differ-
ences in the other ﬁnal focus parameters – happens to be ap-
proaching the y-coordinate value for both the 0.5 TeV (IA)
and 1.0 TeV (IIA) designs for the NLC linear collider (i.e.
39 000, with βmax,y = 190 km and β∗
y = 0.125 mm) [4].
The spot size – clearly indicative of vibration and align-
ment tolerances – is also falling, but even at 100 TeV it
remains an order of magnitude above the spot size in the y
coordinate for the NLC design parameters. For perspective,

then, the design of the ﬁnal focus at 10 TeV CoM energy
may well still be less challenging than the design of the
muon cooling channel, and the latter task is essentially in-
dependent of the collider energy (up to assumed advances
for later generation colliders).

The highest energy parameter set in table 1, at 100 TeV,
clearly presents the most difﬁcult design challenge, for sev-
eral reasons: 1) cost reductions will be needed to make a
machine of this size affordable, 2) siting will be more difﬁ-
cult than at 10 TeV, since the neutrino radiation is now well
βmax/β∗ is almost an
above the U.S. federal limit, 3)
order of magnitude larger than at 10 TeV, 4) The assumed
ǫ6N is 25 times smaller than for the 10 TeV parameters,
albeit with much smaller bunches, so the assumed phase
space density is nearly a factor of two larger, and ﬁnally
5) the beam power has risen to 170 MW, with synchrotron
radiation rising rapidly to contribute a further 110 MW.

p

Most of these extrapolations correspond to incremen-
tal advances in technology, particularly involving magnets:
magnetic ﬁeld strength (for improved cooling and ﬁnal fo-
cus, smaller accelerating rings and collider rings), stability
and uniformity (particularly for the ﬁnal focus) and cost
reduction (for the accelerating rings and collider rings).
Hence, it is certainly not ruled out that such a parameter
set could become achievable after a couple of decades of
research and development dedicated to muon collider tech-
nology.

4 CONCLUSIONS

It has been shown that muon collider parameter sets at up
to 10 TeV CoM energy may well be realistic by today’s
standards of technology while muon colliders at the 100
TeV energy scale require technological extrapolations that
could perhaps be achievable within the relatively near-term
future.

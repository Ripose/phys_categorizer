1 Introduction.

As it was pointed out in works [1, 2], for a number of physical studies which are planned to
be made with the next generation colliders, it is necessary to use polarized beams of both
electrons and positrons. The problem of producing and acceleration of polarized electrons
may be considered to be solved [3], but the existing approaches to create polarized positron
beams [4–7] do not ensure the parameters required (see [8]).

This work proposes a new approach to produce polarized positron beams, which is
based on the process of multiple Compton backscattering of unpolarized ultrarelativistic
positrons in the ﬁeld of intense circularly polarized laser wave.

Under suﬃciently high intensity of a laser ﬂash a positron undergoes N ≫1 successive
collisions with laser photons and at each collision a positron loses a part of its initial energy.
A positron beam acquires (on the average) a partial polarization along the direction
coinciding with the photon momentum.

As shown in work [9] the deﬂection of a relativistic positron (electron) after a single
ω0
mc2 ≪ γ−1
act of Compton back-scattering (CBS) is characterized by the angle θe ∼
0 ,
if γ0 ≤ 105, here ω0 is the laser photon energy (∼ 1 eV), γ0 is the Lorentz-factor of an
initial particle. Therefore, one can assume as a ﬁrst approximation that the divergence of
positron beam does not change, and, further it is possible to consider the characteristics
of a positron beam, as a whole, after its passage through a laser ﬂash.

The quantization axis (z-axis) is chosen to be parallel to the initial positron momentum
(i.e., antiparallel to the laser photon momentum). It is clear that for obtaining a nonzeroth
polarization of the ﬁnal beam, it is necessary that after a multiple process of CBS the
”occupancies” of spin states should diﬀer:

if for the initial unpolarized beam

N↑ 6= N↓ ,

N↑ = N↓ .

1

In a single act of CBS the spin ﬂip processes are described by w↑↓ and w↓↑ probabilites.
In case when w↑↓ = w↓↑, the process of laser polarization is impossible, while at w↑↓ 6=
w↑↓ in the process of multiple Compton scatering the positron beam can achieve the
polarization degree equal to:

ξzmax =

w↑↓ − w↓↑
w↑↓ + w↓↑

.

Here ξzmax is the mostly achievable value of the z–component of the ﬁnal beam polariza-
tion.

In my previos work [10] the wrong estimation of the ﬁnal polarization degree (close
to unit) was obtained. As was shown by G. L. Kotkin, H. Perlt and V. G. Serbo [13]
positrons passing through an intense laser ﬁeld region change their polarization even with-
out interaction with laser photons. It leads to the decreasing of the attainable polarization
value.

In the present work this eﬀect was taken into account. Also the expressions for ω↑↓ and
ω↓↑, were obtained and it was shown that ω↑↓ 6= ω↓↑; the requirements to the parameters
of the laser ﬂash to obtain the signiﬁcant polarization were analyzed; the process of laser
polarization of particles in the storage ring during a short-time period was considered.

2 Compton-eﬀect cross-section on longitudinally po-

larized electron (positron) with spin ﬂip.

The process of Compton backscattering (CBS) will be considered in a system where an
electron (positron) is at rest (rest frame - RF), and a circularly polarized laser photon
moves against the axis z. We will be also interested in the component of the recoil
electron spin along the axis z, since, because of the azimuthal symmetry of the process
after averaging over the assembly of the initial beam particles, the transverse projections
of the spin are set to zero.

The authors of classical work [11] calculated the cross-section of Compton eﬀect for
an electron at rest, considering the correlations among polarizations of all four particles
taking part in the reaction.

After summing up over polarizations of a scattered photon according to [11], one can

get

Here ro – a classical radius of an electron; k0 and k – are the energies of the initial and
scattered photons; Pc – is the degree of a circular polarization of a laser photon; ξoz, ξz
– are the spin components of initial and scattered electrons; the functions of Φi will be
determined later. A similar cross-section for a positron may be obtained after a simple
changing the signs of the terms proportional to Pc.

It should be pointed out that in (1) the term which is proportional to Pcξ0zξz is absent.
For electrons with the initial energy γ0 ≤ 104 and the energy of the laser photon ω0 ∼
1 eV in the laboratory frame (LF) the initial photon energy in the RF system is obtained

after the Lorentz transformation (the system ¯h = m = c = 1 is used)

k0 = (1 + β0)γ0ω0 = 2γ0ω0 << 1 ,

and the energy of a scattering photon may be obtained from the conservation laws:

k =

k0
1 + k0(1 − cos θ)

≈ k0[1 − k0(1 − cos θ)] .

(3)

Here θ – is the angle of a scattered photon in the RF.

In equation (3) the terms of order of k3

0 and higher are neglected. This approximation

will be also used further. Let us write down the functions Φi(k0, cos θ):

Section (5) is invariant and may be used both in the RF, and the LF. The probability of
the Compton eﬀect with a spin ﬂip is proportional to cross-section (5) when ξ0z and ξz
have opposite signs:

w↑↓ = w(ξ0z = +1, ξz = −1) = const{σ0 + Pcσ1 − Pcσ2 − σ3}

w↓↑ = w(ξ0z = −1, ξz = +1) = const{σ0 − Pcσ1 + Pcσ2 − σ3}

As it follows from (5) σ1 6= σ2, therefore, the polarization of scattering electrons in CBS
(laser polarization) is, in principle, possible.

Cross-section (5) can be derived from the invariant expressions with taking into ac-
count the polarization of all particles [12, 13]. Thus, the authors in [13] obtained the
CBS section depending on the longitudinal polarization of a scattered electron (i.e., on
the projection of a scattered electron spin on its momentum) in the invariant form. Fol-
lowing from the above work, let us write down the cross-section where the component of
a scattered electron polarization is maintained along the same axis z as that of the initial
electron:

The coeﬃcients sz, cz are none other than the coeﬃcients of the rotation matrices

from the basis used in [12] to the basis where one of the axes coincides with the axis z.

Substituting (1) into (6) let us write down the section in the form as in (1):

One can easily see that, if sz = s, cz = c,(which corresponds to the longitudinal polar-
ization of a scattered electron), ˜Φ1 = ˜Φ2. However, generally speaking, sz 6= s, cz 6= c,
which can be easily seen in the RF. Let us calculate section (9) in the RF and compare
with the results obtained earlier (Eqs. (4), (5)). Coeﬃcients sz, cz are deﬁned as

and substituting (11), (12), (13) into cross-section (9), one can show that the section
obtained completely coincides with (5), in the same approximation as above.

3 Process of Multiple Compton Backscattering.

Main characteristics.

The number of hard photons N produced in colliding ofone electron with photons of
the laser ﬂash is a random value as well as the other characteristics of the process of
multiple CBS (total radiation losses, the electron multiple scattering angle, etc.).

For simplicity, further we will consider only mathematical expectations of these ran-
dom values, omitting, as a rule the averaging symbol N =< N >. In addition, we will
deal with collisions of single positron bunches with photons. The N value (according
to work [9] it is the conversion coeﬃcient) can be found by using the luminosity of the
process:

N =

Lσ
Ne+

.

Here Ne+ is the number of positrons in a bunch; σ is the cross-section of CBS process; L
is the luminosity:

L = 2cN0Ne+

In (14) N0 is the number of photons in a laser ﬂash; fph, fe are the normalized distributions
of photons and positrons in bunches.

For the analytical estimations we will consider monodirected positron and photon

beams with the Gauss distribution in the transverse and longitudinal directions:

up over the spin of a scaterred positron and averaged over the spin of initial (σ1 ≪ σ0) is
substituted into (17). If the beam after the ”damping-ring” is used as an initial one, in

Let us evaluate the average positron energy after the process of multiple CBS. The

average energy after the ﬁrst collision act is found from the condition

where < ω1 > is the average energy of an emitted photon in the LF, which depends on

Thus,

< γ1 >= γ1 ≈ γ0(1 − k0) = γ0(1 − 2γ0ω0) .

Before the second scattering act a laser photon in the RF will have a smaller energy

< k1 >= k1 = 2γ1ω0 = k0(1 − k0) .

In a similar way one can obtain the relation (further, for the sake of simpliﬁcaton the
averaging symbol is neglected again)

γi+1 = γi(1 − 2ω0γi) .

(20)

From (20) we get the equation in the ﬁnite diﬀerences

∆γi = γi+1 − γi = 2ω0γ2
i .

If the number of scattering acts k ≫ 1, then, passing from the ﬁnite diﬀerence equation
to the diﬀerential one and solving the latter, we have:

γk =

γ0
1 + 2γ0ω0k

=

By making use of (21) one can estimate the total radiation losses by each positron after

V. Telnov [14] proposed to use the process of a multiple CBS for cooling the head-on
electron (positron) beam. Let us estimate the laser ﬂash parameters and the number of
hard photons to decrease an electron initial energy by one order of magnitude:

Hence, we have the following relations for the collision number

(23)

If the initial positron is unpolarized and the laser photons possess a 100 % right-hand
circular polarization (Pc = +1), then, after the ﬁrst scattering act the recoil positrons, on
the whole, become partly polarized. The value of the polarization component along the
z axis can be found from cross-section (5)

(1 − 2k0) = γ0ω0(1 − 4γ0ω0) .

Henceforth the index z will be neglected. Taking into account that before the second
scattering act the photon energy in the RF equal to k1 = k0(1 − k0) from (5) one can ﬁnd
the positron polarization after the second scattering act:

ξ2 =

(25)

(26)

Comparing (25) and (24) one can see that |ξ2| > |ξ1|. By applying the method similar to
the one used to derive (21) the polarization value after N collisions can be found

However, it should be pointed out that the immediate use of the derived formula in order
to evaluate the ﬁnal polarization of the positron beam is illegitimate. The problem is
that, as a unpolarized positron beam is passing through a laser ﬂash, the positrons which
have not interacted with the laser photons become polarized but in the opposite direction
[15]. Thus, the positrons in this part the beam will have a nonzero polarization before the
ﬁrst collision act, and that is why the use of formulas (25,26) in this case gives a wrong
results.

To obtain a correct result it is necessary to perform a Monte Carlo simulation of
CBS process. But the equilibrium polarization value can be found from the elementary

7

balance equations. In passing polarized positrons through a laser ﬂash having the photon
concentration nL hard photons are emitted in the process with a spin ﬂip (ξz = −ξ0z),
and without one (ξz = +ξ0z). The change of the number of positrons having the spins
oriented along the positive N ↑(ξz = +1) and negative direction of the quantization axis
N↓(ξz = −1) is described by the equation resulting from cross-section (9):

= 2nL[−(σ0 + σ1 − σ2 − σ3)N ↑ + (σ0 − σ1 + σ2 − σ3)N ↓] ,

= 2nL[−(σ0 + σ1 − σ2 − σ3)N ↓ + (σ0 − σ1 + σ2 − σ3)N ↑] .

(27)

By adding and subtracting Eqs. (27) we obtain standard balance equations [16]:

Zpol =

The characteristic length of the laser bunch Zpol, after passing which the positron beam
acquires the polarization degree (1 − e−1)ξmax ≈ 0.63 ξmax, is found from the following
relation:

From (18) and (31) we can ﬁnd another characteristic of the laser polarization process
– the average number of Npol photons emitted by each positron after passing the length

Formula (32) is valid for k0 = 2γ0ω0 ≪ 1, since it is in this approximation that the
expressions for σ0 and σ3 (see (9)) were obtained. The value Npol does not depend on
the speciﬁc laser parameters and is a more suitable value, for example, in the case of a
multiple passage of positrons through the laser bunch in the storage ring [8].

As it follows from (32) and (18) the characteristic number of hard photons necessary
for cooling and polarization processes depends on the energy of a laser photon in the RF
such as ∼ 1/k0 and ∼ 1/k2

5 Laser polarization in storage ring.

It was shown in the previous part that by applying a suﬃciently powerful laser one
can, in principle, attain a polarized positron beam during a single pass through a laser
ﬂash. However, the laser parameters to create the signiﬁcant beam polarization with
the time structure necessary for linear colliders are beyond the present-day technology.
An obvious way to increase luminosity of the process is to use a high Q-factor optical
resonator matched with the storage ring where a positron beam is circulating.

In work [17] the authors discussed the possibility of applying a laser with circularly
polarized radiation in order to reduce the time of electrons self-polarization in the storage
ring, and they showed that the CBS process can be used for this purpose.

In his recent work [8] J. Clendenin proposed using a resonator and a damping ring
for simultaneous laser cooling of a positron beam and its laser polarization. It is clear
that the requirements to the laser power are, in this case, considerably decreased (see the
estimations the work cited).

J. Clendenin considered a damping ring with a circumference of 297 m for positrons
with E = 1.98 GeV, which is designed for synchrotron cooling radiation. For laser cooling
of 100 MeV electrons the authors of [18] proposed a small-sized ring which 2 m in diameter.
It is of special interest to estimate the feasibility of this ring for laser polarisation.

For a laser with the wavelength λ ∼ 1 mcm (ω0 - 1.25 eV) the parameter k0 = 2γ0ω0 ≈

10−3, therefore, Npol = 6.1 · 105.

During a single pass through the laser pulse having the energy ∼ 1J and zR = 1 mm
= 0.82 collisions with laser photons,

each positron experiences, on the average, N = 2A
ω0
and the average energy of each emitted photon < ω1 >= 2γ2

0ω0.
Consequently, the energy losses by each positron ∆γ = 4σT γ2

0A/λzR, which coincides

σT
λzR

with formula (3) of work [18].

Thus, the necessary number of turns in the ring to attain Npol is:

n =

Npol
N

= 7.4 · 105,

9

which corresponds to the time τpol = πd/c = 15.5 · 10−3 sec.
It seems that a serious
problem for such a ring is to maintain power in the resonator during the time mentioned.
It takes ∼ 103 laser injections into the resonator during the time τpol if the cavity

Q-factor ∼ 103.

6 Conclusion

All the results were obtained with neglect of the contribution of the nonlinear processes. It
is clear that for the laser ﬂash parameters discussed in Parts 3 and 4 a linear approximation
will be valid, if the length of the laser pulse is rather high: lph >> ZR. To maintain a
transverse size of the laser beam at a suitable level along the full length lph, it is necessary
to apply a channeled laser beam, e.g., in a plasma channel [19] or in a capillary dielectric
tube [20].

For a substantially nonlinear process, when during a single collision act n > 1 laser
photons are absorbed, the average energy of an emitted photon will considerably exceed
the one for a linear process, which will result in decrease in the value Npol. In other side
it should be noted the value of polarization degree ξmax = 5/8 was obtained in work [21]
for moving electron in a long weak helical undulator (see, also, [17]).

Authors of cited paper considered also the case of strong helical undulator where
electron polarization may be much higher (ξmax= 0.92).
It is known the trajectory of
electron in a helical undulator is similar to one in a ﬁeld of the intense circularly-polarized
wave. Having in mind the analogy between radiative processes in the helical undulator
and circularly-polarized wave one may expect that positron polarization during nonlinear
multiple CBS process may exceed the value of (30) and approach to 92%, typical value
for self-polarization mechanism due to synchrotron radiation.

It is evidently the polarization of positron through nonlinear multiple CBS process

demands the detailed investigations.

The interaction of high energy particles with atomic axes and planes allows to observe in crystal
various eﬀects predicted by the quantum electrodynamics of phenomena in strong electromagnetic
ﬁeld.
In particular, the eﬀect of electron-positron pair production by gamma-quanta in a semi-
uniform ﬁeld was observed for the ﬁrst time in eightieth in CERN in the ﬁeld of germanium crystal
axes. The high energy of LHC drastically widens the possibilities of strong ﬁeld QCD eﬀect in-
vestigation in crystals allowing to observe vacuum dichroism and birefringence, electron radiative
self-polarization and polarized electron-positron pair production by gamma-quanta, positron (elec-
tron) anomalous magnetic moment modiﬁcation and electron spin rotation in crystal ﬁeld harmonics.
The eﬀect of vacuum birefringence induced by strong electric ﬁeld is considered in detail.

INTRODUCTION

The eﬀects induced or strongly modiﬁed by intense
electromagnetic ﬁelds greatly widen our understanding
of the nature of electromagnetic ﬁeld, electromagnetic
interaction and particle structure. These eﬀects play im-
portant role in dense cosmic objects as well as in cosmic
ray generation.

For a long time it seemed impossible to study the ef-
fects of QED in strong ﬁelds in earth conditions. Even
the unique experiments of Kapitsa and Sakharov made it
possible to generate only the ﬁelds millions times lower
than the critical ﬁelds

where m is electron mass, typical for the atmospheres
of neutron stars and magnetars in which such eﬀects of
strong ﬁeld QED as electron-positron pair production by
gamma-quanta, gamma-quanta birefringence and split-
ting, electron magnetic moment modiﬁcation and elec-
tron spin radiative self-polarization play important role.
However in seventieth and eighties the possibility of ob-
servation of the eﬀects of QED in strong uniform crystal
ﬁelds was realized [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

A wide applicability of the uniform ﬁeld approxima-
tion for description of radiation processes in the ﬁelds
of crystal planes and axes is explained by the fact that a
forming gamma-quantum or electron-positron pair moves
inside a formation region which, on the one hand, has a
length several orders exceeding the interatomic distance
and, on the other, a transverse dimension which can be
as small as the Compton length. The great length of for-
mation region provides a smearing out of atomic poten-
tials to a continuum potential remaining invariant under

∗bar@minsk.inp.by

the translations along crystal plane or axis. In its turn,
the small transverse dimension provides nearly constant
value of the ﬁeld acting during formation process on par-
ticles moving at suﬃciently small angles in respect to the
crystal plane or axis.

The applicability of the uniform ﬁeld approximation
to description of process in oriented crystals allowed us
to predict [7, 8] the pair production process in strong
semi-uniform continuum crystal ﬁeld as well as intimately
connected to it strong crystal optical anisotropy in hard
gamma-region, directly connected with the anisotropy of
strong uniform ﬁeld in vacuum. While the pair produc-
tion process itself was observed and studied experimen-
tally in CERN in middle eightieth in the ﬁeld of Ge and
W crystal axes, the energies 150
200GeV of tertiary
CERN gamma beams were that time quite far from that
needed to observe the crystal optical anisotropy in hard
gamma-region, namely, the eﬀects of dichroism and bire-
fringence as well as many important eﬀects connected
with electron spin, all of which manifest themselves in
the ﬁelds of crystal planes considerably less intensive
then that of crystal axes. The aim of this paper is to
demonstrate that the LHC energy provides really opti-
mal conditions to observe the eﬀects of strong crystal
optical anisotropy in hard gamma-region [1, 7] directly
connected with the optical anisotropy of strong uniform
ﬁeld [9, 10, 11, 12, 13].

QED eﬀects in mid eightieth were tightly restricted by
the axial case, which allowed to observe the electron-
positron pair production in a semi-uniform electric ﬁeld,
however has not made possible to observe the eﬀects of
uniform ﬁeld optical anisotropy as well as the number
of eﬀects connected with electron spin. The Table also
shows that observation of these eﬀects will become possi-
ble at the LHC gamma- and electron beams the energies
of which will deﬁnitely exceed 1T eV .

III. CRYSTAL DICHROISM

From the many strong ﬁeld QED eﬀects in the uniform
ﬁeld the birefringence eﬀect is naturally distinguished
by its fundamental nature, simplicity of theory and by
the limited energy of its optimal manifestation. This
energy limit arises because of rapid growth of gamma-
quantum absorption at energies ω > ω0 due to the
electron-positron pair production, accompanied by the
strong dichroism. Both the dichroism and birefringence
of uniform ﬁeld manifest themselves much better in the
ﬁeld of crystal planes because the letter is parallel to the
same line, the normal to crystal planes, in all the crystal
volume.

where Z is the monocrystal atomic number and dax in
the interatomic distance on the axis. The estimate (3)
was obtained by averaging a nucleus ﬁeld over a strait
line passing at distance u. A very similar procedure of
the averaging of a nucleus ﬁeld over a plane gives an order
lower estimate

Though the ﬁelds (3) and (4) are quite large, they are
still far below the ﬁeld (2) capable to produce electron-
positron pairs in vacuum. Fortunately, such a ﬁeld can
be reached in the reference frame of ultra relativistic par-
ticles in which the transverse averaged crystal ﬁeld is
”multiplied” by the Lorenz factor equal to the particle
energy measured in the units of its rest energy. Con-
sidering the pair production process which is intimately
connected with dichroism and birefringence phenomena,
it will be natural to use the mass 2mc2 as a ”rest mass” of
a forming electron-positron pair leading to the relativis-
tically magniﬁed ﬁeld strength Emaxω/2m (below we use
the system of units in which ¯h = c = 1) in its reference
frame. This strength will reach the critical value (2) at

magnetic ﬁeld in vacuum.

Various important aspects of theory of electron-
positron pair production in crystals and accompanying
eﬀects of dichroism and birefringence were considered in
[1, 7, 8, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] (see also [21] and [4],
15). First
of all, it was shown there that the general QED formu-
las can be considerably simpliﬁed in the case of gamma-
quantum incidence nearly parallel to crystal planes when
they reduce to the formulas of the theory of electron-
positron pair production by gamma-quanta in a uniform
electromagnetic ﬁeld [4, 9, 10] averaged over the crystal
volume. Let us take the probability

the radiation and pair production characteristics in this
case. Most important for future studies is the conclusion

Besides the necessity to overage the local probabilities
(6) over the crystal volume (in fact, over the inter-plane

distance - see eq. (9)), there exists another complicating
feature of the pair production process in crystals which
does not accompany the same process in a uniform elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld in vacuum.
In fact, the probabilities
(9) describe only the coherent pair production process,
taking place in the averaged ﬁeld of crystal planes. In
addition to it, the incoherent pair production process on
separate nuclei also manifests itself in crystals. This pro-
cess reminds the Bethe-Heitler pair production process,
however is considerably modiﬁed by the inﬂuence of the
averaged crystal ﬁeld on the pair formation process ini-
tiated by a nucleus. The investigation of the radiation
and pair production processes in the uniform ﬁeld in the
presence of Coulomb scatterers allowed us to combine
[17] their theories in uniform electromagnetic ﬁeld and in
amorphous medium as well as to obtain the expressions

A nearly quadratic proportionality of the incoherent

coherent processes in heavier crystals which explains the
lower value of the tungsten polarizer asymmetry. In both
Si and Ge crystals, possessing both lower Z and much
better quality, the asymmetry value reaches its maximum
at the energy close to the ”threshold” energy (5), allow-
ing to observe the eﬀect of uniform ﬁeld dichroism in
optimal conditions as well as to use it for production and
analysis of polarized beams in the TeV energy region.

The LHC energy and strong ﬁelds of crystal planes
provide together really optimal possibilities to observe
the vacuum birefringence of semi-uniform averaged crys-
tal ﬁeld, the nature of which does not principally diﬀer
from that of the magnetic birefringence of vacuum. As is
known, the relation of dichroism and birefringence eﬀects
is expressed mathematically by the dispersion relations.
The latter allow to use the probabilities (9) and (10) to
obtain, respectively, the coherent

The LHC energies provide really optimal conditions
allowing to observe the nonlinear vacuum birefringence
eﬀect by a complete transformation on a linearly polar-
ized gamma-beam to a circularly polarized one in the
quarter wave plate of modest thickness with acceptable
losses of beam intensity. The energy dependence of the
quarter wave plate thickness and the coeﬃcient of lin-
early polarized gamma-beam attenuation at this thick-
ness is given in ﬁg. 3. One can easily see that the
gamma-beam attenuation by a quarter wave plate grows
fast both at low and high energies due to the increase of
relative values of probabilities of, respectively, incoher-
ent (10) and coherent (6) pair production. Due to this
growth an optimal energy region for the observation of
the birefringence eﬀect arises. However especially large

and incoherent

IV. CRYSTAL BIREFRINGENCE

As is well known, dichroism manifestation predeter-
mines the existence of birefringence. In particular, the
polarization dependence of pair production in uniform
magnetic ﬁeld by photons is connected with the eﬀect
of magnetic birefringence of vacuum. This eﬀect is de-
scribed by the non-linear QED lagrangian [11, 12] and is
considered [13] as ”one of the most important predictions
of QED which has not been veriﬁed”. It also widely man-
ifests itself in the atmospheres of neutron stars and white
dwarfs, determining the linear polarization of x-ray radi-
ation emitted from their surfaces. The eﬀect of magnetic
birefringence of vacuum causes the Cotton-Mouton eﬀect
or transformation of the linearly polarized light into the
circularly polarized one (or vice versa).

For a long time people try to observe this eﬀect measur-
ing a small ellipticity acquired by linearly polarized light
in the laboratory magnetic ﬁeld. However because of the
low photon frequencies and magnetic ﬁeld strengths one
has to observe the ellipticity as small as 10−9.

An alternative method to study nonlinear eﬀect of vac-
uum birefringence by observing the Cotton-Mouton ef-
fect accompanying polarized gamma-quanta propagation
through crystals was proposed by Cabibbo [22]. The
birefringence eﬀect predicted by Cabibbo is connected
with polarization dependence of the so-called coherent
pair production and its nature considerably diﬀers from
that of the magnetic birefringence of vacuum. This eﬀect
can be observed at the energies considerably lower than
the ”threshold” energy (5). The preliminary results [23]
of its observation are somewhat uncertain.

5

netic ﬁeld can be observed in the ﬁeld of crystal planes
(see ﬁg. 1) which has opposite directions on the oppo-
site sides of crystal planes only because the signs of these
eﬀects do not depend on the sign of the ﬁeld projection
on the plane normal. Unfortunately, all the eﬀects con-
nected with the electron spin behavior in electromagnetic
ﬁeld do not possess this property and can not be so di-
rectly observed in usual crystals. A method making it
possible to observe these eﬀects was suggested in [24] and
consists in using bent crystals in which channelling par-
ticles move in the regions in which the transverse ﬁeld of
particular direction dominates. Remind that bent crys-
tals can be also used both to clean the halo of the LHC
beam and to extract it for experiments on a ﬁxed target.

Bent crystals also allow to observe electron self-
polarization [25, 26] (see also [27, 28]) and polarized
electron-positron pair production by gamma-quanta [8,
29] (see also [30]), positron (electron) drastic magnetic
moment decrease [31, 32], and electron spin rotation in
a circularly polarized electromagnetic wave [33, 34, 35]
in crystal ﬁeld harmonics [36]. Comparing with the crys-
tal optical anisotropy in the gamma-region, the theory
of eﬀects connected with the electron (positron) spin will
be additionally complicated by the necessity to consider
both the charged particle motion in crystal ﬁeld and its
disturbances caused by multiple scattering and radiative
cooling [37, 38].

Note also that another mechanism of dichroism and
birefringence connected with electron and positron scat-
tering asymmetry by crystal axes [39] was predicted in
[40, 41]. Special attempts to study the manifestation on
these eﬀects at LHC energies should be undertaken.

The Photon collider at ILC:
status, parameters and technical problems ∗

Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics, 630090 Novosibirsk, Russia

V.I. Telnov †

Abstract

This paper is the second part of my overview on photon colliders given at the conference
“The photon:
its ﬁrst hundred years and the future” (PHOTON2005 + PLC2005). The
ﬁrst paper [1] describes the ﬁrst 25 years of the history and evolution of photon colliders.
The present paper considers the photon collider at the ILC: possible parameters, technical
problems and present status.

Introduction

There is a consensus in the particle-physics community that the next large project after the
LHC should be a linear e+e− collider. Due to the high cost of such a collider it has been
agreed to build a single collider at the energy 2E0 = 0.5–1 TeV instead of the three regionally
developed colliders, TESLA, NLC and JLC. In 2004, the International Linear Collider (ILC),
based on the superconducting TESLA-like technology, was inaugurated. The project will be
approved for construction after observation of interesting physics in this energy region by the
LHC, which starts operation in 2007. At present, the development of the ILC and its detectors is
proceeding under the guidance of the ILCSC, GDE and WWS committees. The next steps are:
the choice of the baseline conﬁguration, the reference design, site selection, and the conceptual
and technical designs.

It is well understood that in addition to e+e− physics, linear colliders provide a unique
opportunity to study γγ and γe interactions at high energy and luminosity [2, 3, 4]. High-energy
photons are obtained by ”conversion” of electrons into high-energy photons using Compton
scattering of laser light at a small distance from the interaction point (IP), Fig. 1. The photon
collider is highly appreciated by the physics community: more than 20% of all publications on
linear colliders are devoted to photon colliders (in spite of the fact that at present this activity
is not funded).

The motivation for the photon collider is very strong:

The physics is very rich [4–11] :

•

– the energy is lower than in e+e− collisions only by 10–20%;
– the number of interesting events is similar or even greater;

there are no technical stoppers; the risk is small because in the case of technical prob-
lems the detector can continue taking data in the e+e− mode of collisions; the relative
incremental cost is small;

there is a great interest in the physics community to such experiments.

•
It is assumed that during the ﬁrst several years of ILC operation all ILC detectors (whether
one or two) will run in e+e− mode. Then, one of the interaction regions (IRs) and detectors will
be modiﬁed for operation in the γγ, γe mode. In other words, e+e− collisions are considered
“baseline,” while γγ, γe is seen as an “option”. Now, “option” is quite a misleading term, one
that some people (including some of the ILC leaders) understand as an absolute priority of
e+e− in all decisions and considerations, while the photon collider is seen as being far in the
future and thus not requiring any attention at this time. Moreover, in order to reduce the ILC
cost, there is a tendency to simplify the ILC design to a bare minimum: one IP, one detector,
no options. One physicist’s comment regarding this was, “we do not need such a bicycle!”

Yes, the photon collider is part of the second stage of the ILC, but it has many speciﬁc
features (see the list below) that strongly inﬂuence the baseline ILC conﬁguration and the
parameters of practically all of its subsystems. These requirements should be included into
the baseline project from the very beginning—otherwise the upgrade from e+e− to γγ, γe will
be very costly (or even impossible at all) and (or) the parameters (such as the luminosity) of
the photon collider will be much worse than in the case of a properly optimized design. All

2

this means that the photon collider should be considered from the beginning as an
integral part of the ILC project!

As for the cost, it is hard to imagine a project as cost-eﬀective as the ILC photon collider.
It practically doubles the ILC physics program while increasing the total cost project only by
(3%). It is my ﬁrm belief that it will be no problem at all to convince the funding agencies
O
that such an small increment of the ILC cost, which allows the ILC to study new phenomena
in new types of collisions, is extremely well justiﬁed.

The next few years before the completion of the ﬁnal ILC technical design are very important
for the photon collider. All machine features required for the photon collider should be properly
included in the basic ILC design. Of course, it is also important to continue the development
of the physics program and to start, at last, the development of the laser system, which is a key
element of the photon collider—but even more urgent are the accelerator and interaction-region
aspects that inﬂuence the design of the entire ILC project.

The most comprehensive description of the photon collider available at present is part of
the TESLA TDR [4]; almost all considerations done for TESLA are valid for the ILC as well.
In the following sections I consider the most important problems of the photon collider that
need special and careful attention of ILC designers.

2 Requirements for the ILC design

The photon collider imposes several special requirements that should be taken into account in
the baseline ILC design:

•

•

•

•

For the removal of disrupted beams, the crab-crossing angle at one of the interaction
regions should be about 25 mrad; the ILC conﬁguration should allow an easy transition
between e+e− and γγ modes of operation;

The γγ luminosity is nearly proportional to the geometric e−e− luminosity, so the product
of the horizontal and vertical emittances should be as small as possible (this translates
into requirements on the damping rings and beam-transport lines);

The ﬁnal-focus system should provide a beam-spot size at the interaction point that is as
small as possible (compared to the e+e− case, the horizontal β-function should be smaller
by one order of magnitude);

The very wide disrupted beams should be transported to the beam dumps with acceptable
losses. The beam dump should be able to withstand absorption of a very narrow photon
beam after the Compton scattering;

•

The detector design should allow easy replacement of elements in the forward region
(<100 mrad);

Space for the laser and laser beam lines has to be reserved.

•
Ignorance of any of these requirements can result in the future in a signiﬁcant increase of

the cost, in loss of time and in poor photon-collider parameters.

3 Photon collider luminosity

There are three luminosity problems at photon colliders: 1) obtaining high luminosities, 2)
stabilization of beam collisions, 3) measurement of the luminosities, all these problems are
discussed below. The most important and urgent at this time is the ﬁrst problem.

3.1 Towards high γγ, γγ luminosities

∼

The γγ luminosity at the ILC energies is determined by the geometric luminosity of electron
beams [12, 13, 4]. There is an approximate general rule: the luminosity in the high-energy
0.1Lgeom, where Lgeom = N 2νγ/4πpǫnxǫny βxβy. So, to maximize
part of the spectrum Lγγ
the luminosity, one needs the smallest beam emittances ǫnx, ǫny and beta-functions at the IP,
approaching the bunch length. Compared to the e+e− case, where the minimum transverse
beam sizes are determined by beamstrahlung and beam instability, the photon collider needs
a smaller product of horizontal and vertical emittances and a smaller horizontal beta-function.
1010, σz = 0.3 mm, ν = 14100 Hz,

ǫnx = 10−5 m, ǫny = 4
σz = 0.3 mm is not a problem, while
the minimum value of the horizontal β-function is restricted by chromo-geometric aberrations
in the ﬁnal-focus system [4]. For the above emittances, the limit on the eﬀective horizontal

the fact that many cross sections in γγ are larger than those in e+e− collisions by one order of

The above-mentioned luminosity corresponds to the beam parameters optimized for the
e+e− collisions where the luminosity is determined by collision eﬀects. The photon collider
has no such restrictions and can work with much smaller beam sizes. The horizontal beam
300 nm, while the simulation shows that
size at the parameters under consideration is σx
the photon collider at such energies can work even with σx
10 nm without fundamental
limitations [4]. So, we are very far from the physical limit and should do all that is possible to
minimize transverse beam sizes at the photon collider!

10−5, ǫny = 3

It should be noted that the minimum βx depends on the horizontal emittance. It is about
5 mm for the nominal emittance and 3.7 (2.2) mm for emittances reduced by a factor of 2
In the TESLA project, we considered emittances close to the latter case:
(4), respectively.
10−8 m, which gives a γγ luminosity that is a factor of 3.5 higher!
ǫnx = 0.25
The beams are produced in the damping rings (DR), so the minimum emittances are de-
termined by various physics eﬀects such as quantum ﬂuctuations in synchrotron radiation and
intra-beam scattering (IBS). The latter is the most diﬃcult to overcome. Where is the limit?
One of the possible way for reducing emittances is to decrease the damping time by adding
wigglers [16], which has not yet been considered in detail by experts.

Damping rings are complex devices, so one should trust only careful studies. Nevertheless,

I would like to make some rough estimates.

The turn shift due to the beam space charge may be unimportant due to strong damping. This
looks promising and needs a serious consideration by DR experts !

Let us assume a reduction (compared to the nominal beam parameters) of ǫnx by a factor
of 6, ǫny by a factor of 4 and βx down to 1.7 mm (it is possible for such emittances). Then,
1010, ν = 14 kHz,
one can have the following parameters of the photon collider: N = 2

The resulting γγ luminosity is greater than that at the “nominal” ILC beam parameters by
a factor of 8.5. The statistics in γγ collisions would then be higher than in e+e− by one order
of magnitude, which would open new possibilities such as the study of Higgs self-coupling in
hh threshold [18, 19].

Figures 2 show simulated luminosity spectra for these parameters. All important eﬀects are
taken into account, including the increase of the vertical beam size in the detector ﬁeld due to
the crab crossing (Sect. 3). In the ﬁgure on the right, only one of the electron beams is converted

By increasing the distance between the conversion and interaction regions, one can obtain
a rather monochromatic luminosity spectrum of a reduced luminosity for the study of QCD
processes [23].

2.

I would like to stress once again that the parameters of the ILC damping rings are dictated
not by e+e−, but by γγ collisions and a decision on the DR design should be based on the
dependence Lγγ = f (DR cost). It could be that the increase of the γγ luminosity by a factor
of 8.5 as suggested above is too diﬃcult, but even x2 – x3 improvement would be quite useful.
This is very important and urgent question !

3.2 Luminosity stabilization

Beam collisions (luminosity) at linear colliders can be adjusted by a feedback system that
measures the beam-beam deﬂection using beam position monitors (BPM) and corrects beam
positions by fast kickers. This method is considered for e+e− collisions and is assumed for γγ
as well [4].

There are some diﬀerences between the e+e− and γγ cases:

In the e+e− case, at small vertical displacements the beams attract each other and oscil-
late. In the γγ case (e−e− as well), the beams repel each other; as a result, the deﬂection
angle is larger.

In the γγ case, due to Compton scattering, the average energy in the disrupted beam
is several times smaller than the beam energy, which leads to a further increase of the
deﬂection angle.
In γγ collisions, σx is several times smaller than in the e+e− case. Due to a strong beam-
beam instability, the kick is large and almost independent of the initial displacement.

There are two additional complications in γγ collisions:

The deﬂection curves depend on the conversion eﬃciency.
Due to the crossing angle, the disrupted beam is deﬂected (mostly vertically) by the de-
tector ﬁeld. This additional deﬂection is comparable to the beam-beam deﬂection angle
and also depends on the conversion probability, see Fig. 5. This eﬀect shifts the zero
point and creates a problem for stabilization of beam-beam collisions.

Typical deﬂection curves for e+e− and γγ collisions are shown in Fig.3. For the γγ case, a
smaller energy is taken in order to emphasize the diﬀerence: the step-like behavior of the ϑy
on the displacement ∆y. More general cases for γγ are shown in Fig.4.

We see that the deﬂection depends on the conversion coeﬃcient, the deﬂection curves are

symmetric but shifted vertically due to the detector ﬁeld by some variable value.

How does one determine the vertical beam positions corresponding to the maximum γγ
luminosity? Here is the sloution. All deﬂection curves θy = f (∆y) have one common feature:
the derivatives f ′ reach the maximum at the point of zero beam shifts where Lγγ is maximum.

jump in the deﬂection curve with an accuracy of about 2σy;

2. Continue the scan with the step 0.1σy up and down around the point with the maximum
derivative. The loss of Lγγ due to “walking” around the zero point will be negligibly small.
3. The horizontal zero point can be found in a similar way by varying the horizontal sep-
aration and measuring the horizontal deﬂection or by varying the horizontal separation
and measuring the vertical deﬂection (the maximum vertical deﬂection corresponds to
the zero horizontal separation).

4. In addition, the deﬂection in the detector ﬁeld is very useful for optimization of the
γ conversion. One just moves the laser beam and measures the vertical position of
e
the outgoing beam in a BPM at a distance of about 4 m from the IP. The maximum
beam displacement corresponds to the maximum conversion eﬃciency.

→

7

So, monitoring the the beam-beam deﬂection is a good method of stabilization of the γγ,
γe luminosities at the ILC. The required algorithm does not appear to be diﬃcult to implement
thanks to the large train length and large inter-bunch spacing.

3.3 Luminosity measurement

The measurement of the luminosity at the photon collider is not an easy task. The spectra are
broad and one should measure the luminosity and polarization as a function of energies E1, E2
of the colliding particles [21]. The luminosity spectrum and polarization can be measured using
l+l−γ [21, 22] for γγ
various QED processes. These are γγ
e−e+e− for γe collisions [21]. Some other SM processes can
collisions and γe
be useful as well.

There is one unsolved problem in the measurement of linear polarizations in γγ colli-
sions [24]. There exists an average linear photon polarization at a given energy that can be
l+l−. However, in addition to that, high
measured from the azimuthal distribution in γγ
energy photons have a linear polarization whose direction depends on the photon scattering
angle. The directions of linear polarization of the colliding beams correlate, as the product of
the linear polarizations l1,γl2,γ (which is presented in the cross section for the Higgs production)
is quite large even for completely unpolarized initial particles. This correlation is not observ-

Fortunately, this eﬀect is absent at the high-energy peak of γγ luminosity, which can be used
for the Higgs study.

4 The crossing angle for the photon collider

4.1 Minimum crossing angle

The beam-crossing angle at the ILC is now one of the most hotly debated issues. For exper-
imentation with e+e− beams, zero or small angles are preferable, but in this case there are
some problems with the removal of used beams. At present, two IPs are considered for ILC,
one with a small crossing angle, 2 mrad, and the other with a large crossing angle, 14 or 20
mrad, where 14 is somewhat more preferred.

In γγ collisions, the outgoing beams are strongly disrupted and for their removal a larger
crossing angle is needed. In order to have better compatibility with e+e− this angle should be
as small as possible. So, there are several questions:

•

•

what is the minimum crossing angle suitable for γγ ?
is this angle compatible with e+e− ?
what is the upgrade path from e+e− to γγ ?

•
For removal of these disrupted beams one needs the crab-crossing angle to be larger than
the disruption angle plus the angular size of the ﬁnal quad, see Fig. 1. There is an additional
requirement: the ﬁeld outside the quad should be small in order to add a small deﬂection angle
for the low-energy particles in the outgoing beam.

After passing the conversion and collision points, the electrons have energy ranging from
about 5 GeV up to E0 and the horizontal disruption angle up to about 10 mrad, see Fig.7

8

(due to limited statistics in simulation, about 105 macroparticles, the maximum angles should
be multiplied by a factor of 1.2 [4]). Above this angle, the total energy of particles is less
than that in the secondary irremovable e+e− background. The disruption angle for low-energy
particles is proportional to pN/σzE [25] and depends very weakly on transverse beam sizes.

trons after Compton scattering and
interaction with the opposing electron
beam; N = 2

1010, σz = 0.3 mm.

×

Due to the crossing angle, the detector ﬁeld gives an additional deﬂection angle to the dis-
rupted beam, see Fig.8. A crab-crossing angle of 25 mrad is assumed. These ﬁgures correspond

to central collisions. For beams with an initial relative shift at the IP, the central core is shifted
due to the instability of collisions but the maximum angles remain practically the same and
decrease for large beams shifts. One can see that particles get mostly a vertical deﬂection,
so the total vertical angle is about 17 mrad. The solenoid ﬁeld also leads to some horizontal
displacement (due to the vertical motion of particles) but it is smaller than the vertical shift
of the beam.

9

A possible quad design for the photon collider was suggested by B. Parker [26, 14], see
Fig. 9. The quad consists of two quads of diﬀerent radii, one inside another, with opposite
ﬁeld directions. In this design, the gradient on the axis is reduced only by 15%, and the ﬁeld
outside the quad is practically zero. The radius of the quad, the cryostat taken into account,

4.2 Other eﬀects due to crossing angle

Crab-crossing. In order to preserve the luminosity at large crossing angles, the crab-crossing
scheme is used, Fig.1, where beams are tilted by special RF crab-cavities. The requirements
on the time and amplitude stabilities of the RF become more stringent with the increase of the
crab-crossing angle. This problem is more important for the photon collider where beams have
smaller σx. For stabilization of the crab-crossing angle, a fast feedback should be used based

10

on the rate of background processes (e+e− pairs) and the azimuthal distributions of outgoing
particles (in the detector and beam dump), in addition to the beam stabilization feedback
based on beam deﬂection (Sect.3.2). This problem need a detailed study.

Non-zero vertical collision angle. Due to the detector ﬁeld, e−e− beams collide at a
non-zero vertical collision angle that is several times larger than σy/σz, Fig.11. This angle
can be removed by a dipole correction winding in quads [27]. Such a correction shifts the IP
vertically by about 300 µm, which is an acceptable amount.

The increase of the vertical beam size due to SR. Synchrotron radiation (SR) in
the detector ﬁeld leads to an increase of the vertical beam size. This eﬀect was considered in
Refs. [27, 14] for the detector ﬁelds as of Summer 2005. In Spring 2006, the length of the LDC
detector was shorten from 7.4 m to 5.6 m. The simulation was repeated for the detector ﬁeld
presented in Fig.12. Beam parameters correspond to the nominal ILC case: 2E0 = 500 GeV,
10−6 m, βx = 21 mm, βy = 0.4 mm.

For the γγ case, instead of the γγ luminosity I simulated the e−e− luminosity (without
γ conversion) with σy(γγ) = √2σy(e+e−) in order to take into account an eﬀective
the e
increase of the vertical beam size due to Compton scattering. All interactions between particles
were switched oﬀ. The position of the ﬁrst quad (shifted in the e−e−(γγ) case in order to have
a zero collision angle) was z = 3.8–6 m for all detectors. Results of the simulation are presented
in Table 4.2; the statistical accuracy is about
It is interesting that LDC is the best
±
for e+e− and the worst for γγ, which is due to the compensation quadrupole in the γγ case.
Its contribution depends on the shape of the ﬁeld at the location of the quad (the radial ﬁeld
and the quad ﬁeld have the same direction and therefore are added).

4.3 Beam dump

The photon collider needs a special beam dump, one that is very diﬀerent from the e+e− beam
dump. There are two main diﬀerences:

•

•

•

The disrupted beams at a photon collider consist of an equal mixture of electrons and
photons (and some admixture of positrons);

Disrupted beams at the photon collider are very wide (see Fig. 13), and need exit pipes
of a large diameter.

On the other hand, the photon beam following the Compton scattering is very narrow.
At the distance of 250 m from the IP, the r.m.s. transverse size of the photon beam is
0.35 mm2, see Fig. 14, with a power of about 10 MW. It cannot be dumped directly
1
at a solid or liquid material.

×

There exists an idea of such a beam dump, as well as some simulations [28], but a next step
required, a more careful study. The idea is the following. The water beam dump is situated
at the distance of about 250 m from the IP, Fig. 15. The electron beam can be swept by fast
magnets (as in the TESLA TDR) and its density at the beam dump will be acceptable. In

Figure 13: Angular distributions of electrons (left) and photons (right) after the conversion
and interaction points.

Figure 14: Energy-angular distributions of beamstrahlung photons (left) and the angular dis-
tribution of Compton photons (right).

∼

order to spread the photon beam we suggest placing a gas target, for example Ar at P
4
atm, at a distances of 120 to 250 m from the IP: photons would produce showers, the beam
diameter would increase, and the density at the beam dump would become acceptable. In order
to decrease the neutron ﬂux in the detector, one can add a volume ﬁlled with hydrogen gas
just before the Ar target, which would reduce the ﬂux of backward-scattered neutrons at the
IP at least by one order of magnitude. The corresponding numbers can be found in Ref. [28].
In order to reduce the diameter of the beamline between the beam dump and the IP, it is
desirable to slightly focus the disrupted electron (positron) beam just after the exit from the
detector (this issue has not been considered yet). The angular distribution of beamstrahlung
photons is similar to that of beamstrahlung electrons that produced these photons. However,
the energy of beamstrahlung photons produced by the rather low-energy large-angle electrons
is only a small fraction of their energy, so the eﬀective (energy-weighted) angular distribution
of photons is narrower than that for electrons. According to Fig. 13 (right), for photons a
clearance angle of

3 mrad will be suﬃcient, which is 75 cm at the distance of 250 m.

The Ar target should have a diameter of no more than 10 cm (a shower of such a diameter
does not present a problem for the beam dump). The rest of the volume of the exit pipe with
a diameter of about 1.5 m can be ﬁlled with air at 1 atm (or vacuum). Such measures are
necessary in order to avoid unnecessary scattering of low-energy electrons traveling at large
distances from the axis and thus to reduce the energy losses and activation of materials (water,
air) in the unshielded area (it is diﬃcult to shield a 200 m tube).

5 Conﬁguration of the IP, transition from e+e− to γγ

In order to save time and money, it is desirable to have an interaction region that requires a
minimum modiﬁcation for transition from e+e− to γγ collisions and back. The ideal case: the
same beamlines and beamdumps, only minor modiﬁcations in the forward part of the detector.
However, at present, the requirements presented by the e+e− and γγ cases are very diﬀerent
and no consensus reached. The diﬀerences are the following:

•

•

γγ, γe: the crab-crossing angle is 25 mrad (minimum), the outgoing beams go straight to
the beam dump. Beams are very disrupted, so only the simplest diagnostics is possible,
such as measurement of the beam proﬁle in the beam dump area;

e+e−: the crab-crossing angle is 14–20 mrad, the extraction line includes many diagnostics
such as precise measurement of the beam energy and polarization.

At present, the ILC beam delivery group has the following suggestion [29]. The extraction
lines and the beam dump for e+e− and γγ are very diﬀerent. Their replacements (transition
to γγ and back after the energy upgrade) will be problematic due to induced radioactivity.
Therefore it makes sense to have diﬀerent crossing angles and separate extraction lines and
beam dumps for e+e− and γγ. For the transition from e+e− to γγ one has to move the
detector and about 700 m of the up-stream beamline, Fig.16. The displacement of the detector
is equal to 1.8 m and 4.2 m for the increase of the crab-crossing angle from 20 to 25 mrad and
from 14 to 25 mrad, respectively.

I have an alternative suggestion: the same crossing angle, the same beam dump and no
detector displacement. The cost will be reduced considerably, by hundreds of millions of dollars!
No time is needed for the shift of beamlines (700 m!). What are disadvantages? In this case, the

below.

designs of the extraction line and the beamdump are dictated by γγ, so no precision diagnostic
in the extraction line for e+e− is possible. But is it really necessary? Indeed, without such
special extraction line we can measure the energy and polarization before collisions, many
characteristics during the beam collision (the acollinearity angles, distributions of the secondary
e+e− pairs, the beam deﬂection angles); we can measure the angular distributions and the
charged and neutral contents in the disrupted beams. All this allows the reconstruction of
the dynamics of beam collisions, with a proper corrections in the simulation. For example,
the depolarization during the collision is rather small, knowledge of beam parameters with a
10–20% accuracy is suﬃcient for introducing theoretical corrections. Direct measurement of
the polarization after the collisions does not exclude the necessity of such a correction, it is
just one additional cross check, but there are many other cross checks besides the polarization.
An additional remark. The requirement for the instrumented extraction line for e+e−
restricts the accessible set of beam parameters and correspondingly the luminosity. One can
not use it for the case of large beamstrahlung losses. It will not work, for example, in the CLIC
environment or at the photon collider. In other words, such diagnostic of outgoing beams is

15

useful but not absolutely necessary at linear colliders.

This suggestion is very attractive, cost- and time-eﬀective, and deserves a serious consider-

ation by appropriate GDE committees.

The most attractive scheme for a photon collider with the ILC pulse structure is storage

This can reduce the required laser power by a factor of Q

cavity).

Dependence of the γγ luminosity on the ﬂash energy and f# = F/2R (ﬂat-top laser beam)
for several values of the parameter ξ2 (which characterizes the multi-photon eﬀects in Compton
scattering, ξ2 < 0.3 is acceptable [4]) is presented in Fig. 17 [14]. This simulation is based on
the formula for the ﬁeld distribution near the laser focus for ﬂat-top laser beams.
It was
assumed that αc = 25 mrad and the angle between the horizontal plain and the edge of the
laser beam is 17 mrad (the space required for disrupted beams and quads, see Fig. 10). At
the optimum, f#
30 mrad.
If the focusing mirror is situated outside the detector at the distance of 15 m from the IP, it
should have a diameter of about 1 m. All other mirrors in the ring cavity can have smaller
diameters, about 20 cm is suﬃcient from the damage point-of-view (diﬀraction losses require
an additional check).

An alternative scheme was considered in the TESLA TDR: the ﬁnal pairs of mirrors are
situated inside the detector, Fig.18. In this case, the diameter of the focusing mirrors is only
20 cm and that of auxiliary mirrors is about 11 cm. The dead angle for tracking remains, as
before, about
95 mrad; it can be smaller for the calorimeters, and may be the same as for
e+e−. The laser density at the mirrors is far from the damage threshold, the average power is
the most serious problem [4].

Though the cavity reduces substantially the required laser energy, the laser should still be
very powerful. According to a LLNL estimation, the cost of one such laser is about $ 10 M
[32]. The photon collider needs two such lasers and one or two spares.

The same laser with the 1 µm wavelength can be used up to the ILC energy 2E0

700 GeV.
At higher energies, the γγ luminosity decreases due to e+e− pair creation in the conversion
region in collision of the high-energy and laser photons [3, 33] and due to the decrease of the
Compton cross section, see Fig. 19 [14]. For the energy 2E0 = 1 TeV, the reduction in the
luminosity due to this eﬀect is about a factor of 2–3 compared to the optimum case. For the
high energies it is desirable to have a wavelength of about 1.5–2 µm. The technical feasibility
of such a laser has not been studied yet.

7 Conclusion

In summary I would like to stress several important issues that need urgent attention of the
ILC designers (GDE).

•

•

•

We need a clear and inexpensive path from the e+e− to γγ, γe modes of operation. The
best would be an IP with a crab-crossing angle of about 25 mrad both for e+e− and γγ.
This is possible, but an eﬀort is required to reach a consensus in the physics community.
The presently suggested upgrade pass is too diﬃcult, considerably increases the ILC cost
and is time-consuming.

In order to achieve high luminosity at the photon collider, damping rings with emittances
that are much smaller than for e+e− are required. A serious and detailed study of this
problem is needed. It is not excluded that a optimized wiggler-dominated storage ring
will allow a x3 – x5 higher luminosity than that in the present design.

The photon collider is not “an option” that can be implemented some time later — it
is an integral part of the ILC project and considerably inﬂuences the baseline designs of
practically all ILC systems. In addition, the key element of the project is a very unique,
state-of-the-art laser system whose development required substantial time and ﬁnances.
The photon collider can be successfully built only if it is an integral part of the e+e−,
γγ, γe, e−e− linear collider.

I would like to thank Maria Krawczyk for her great eﬀorts on organization of PHOTON2005
in Warsaw and PLC2005 in Kazimierz and creating a beautiful and friendly atmosphere at the
conferences.

PRODUCTION AND STUDIES OF PHOTOCATHODES FOR HIGH

INTENSITY ELECTRON BEAMS

Abstract
For short, high-intensity electron bunches, alkali-tellurides
have proved to be a reliable photo-cathode material. Mea-
surements of lifetimes in an RF gun of the CLIC Test Fa-
cility II at ﬁeld strengths greater than 100 MV/m are pre-
sented. Before and after using them in this gun, the spec-
tral response of the Cs-Te and Rb-Te cathodes were deter-
mined with the help of an optical parametric oscillator. The
behaviour of both materials can be described by Spicer’s
3-step model. Whereas during the use the threshold for
photo-emission in Cs-Te was shifted to higher photon ener-
gies, that of Rb-Te did not change. Our latest investigations
on the stoichiometric ratio of the components are shown.
The preparation of the photo-cathodes was monitored with
320 nm wavelength light, with the aim of improving the
measurement sensitivity. The latest results on the protec-
tion of Cs-Te cathode surfaces with CsBr against pollution
are summarized. New investigations on high mean current
production are presented.

INTRODUCTION

In the CTF II drive beam gun, Cs-Te photocathodes are
used to produce a pulse train of 48 electron bunches, each
10 ps long and with a charge of up to 10 nC [1]. In CTF, the
main limit to lifetime is the available laser power, which
requires a minimal quantum efﬁciency (QE) of 1.5 % to
produce the nominal charge. Although Cs-Te photocath-
odes are widely used, a complete understanding, especially
of their aging process, is still lacking. Spectra of the QE
against exciting photons may help to understand the phe-
nomenon.

2 MEASUREMENTS OF QE AGAINST

PHOTON ENERGY

According to Spicer [2], the spectra of the quantum efﬁ-
ciency (QE) of semiconductors with respect to the energy
of the exciting photons (hν) can be described as:

QE =

c1(hν − ET )

c2 + (hν − ET )

,

where ET is the threshold energy for photoemission, c1 and
c2 are constants.

2.1 The OPO
To measure the spectral response of photocathodes, wave-
lengths from the near UV throughout the visible are nec-
essary. To attain these, an Optical Parametrical Oscillator
was built [3]. A frequency-tripled Nd:YAG laser pumps

a BetaBarium Borate (BBO) crystal in a double-pass con-
ﬁguration, as shown in Fig. 1. The emerging signal-beam,
with wavelengths between 409 nm and 710 nm,
is fre-
quency doubled in two BBO crystals. The wavelengths
obtained are between 210 nm and 340 nm. The idler-beam
delivers wavelengths between 710 nm and 2600 nm.

The measurements of the spectral response of photocath-
odes were made in the DC-gun of the photoemission lab at
CERN [4], at a ﬁeld strength of about 8 MV/m. Spectra
were taken shortly after the evaporation of the cathode ma-
terials onto the copper cathode plug, as well as after use in
the CTF II RF-gun [5] at ﬁelds of typically 100 MV/m.

2.2 Cesium Telluride
To be able to interpret the spectra in terms of Spicer’s the-
ory, it was necessary to split the data into 2 groups, one at
“low photon energy” and one at ”high photon energy”, see
Fig. 2. Then, the data can be ﬁtted well with two indepen-
dent curves, following Eq. (1), which give two threshold
energies. For a typical fresh Cs-Te cathode, the high energy
threshold is 3.5 eV, the low one is 1.7 eV, as shown in Fig. 2,
upper curve. This might be a hint that two photo-emissive
phases of Cs-Te on copper exist. Several explanations are
possible: The copper might migrate into the Cs-Te, creating
energy levels in the band gap; or possibly not only Cs2Te,
but also other Cs-Te compounds might form on the surface
and these might give rise to photoemission at low photon
energy. A hint to this might be that the ratio of evaporated
atoms of each element is not corresponding to Cs2Te, see
below.

After use, we found that not only the complete spectrum
shifted towards lower quantum efﬁciency, but also that the
photoemission threshold for high QE increased to 4.1 eV,
which is shown in Fig. 2, lower curve. One might expect
that the photocathode is poisoned by the residual gas, pre-
venting low-energy electrons from escaping. However, be-

cause typical storage lifetimes are of the order of months,
the effect must be connected to either the laser light, or the
electrical ﬁeld.

We also produced a Cs-Te cathode on a thin gold ﬁlm of
100 nm thickness. As shown in Fig. 3, the shoulder in the
low energy response disappeared. It is difﬁcult to ﬁt a curve
for the Spicer model to the low energy data. The “high”
photoemission threshold is at 3.5 eV. At the moment, this
cathode is in use in the CTF II gun and will be remeasured
in the future. In terms of lifetime, this cathode is compa-
rable to the best Cs-Te cathodes, as it has already operated
for 20 days in the RF-gun.

2.4 Coating with CsBr

Long lifetimes for Cs-Te cathodes are achieved only when
they are held under UHV (≤ 10−8 mbar). Other photocath-
ode materials like K-Sb-Cs are immunized against gases
like oxygen by evaporating thin ﬁlms of CsBr onto them
[6]. Therefore, we evaporated a CsBr ﬁlm of 2 nm thick-
ness onto the Cs-Te. Fig. 5 shows the spectrum before the
CsBr ﬁlm (square points) and after it (round points). The

2.3 Rubidium Telluride

As a new material presented ﬁrst in [1], we tested rubidium-
telluride. We took spectra of QE before and after use in the
CTF II gun, as for Cs-Te. Remarkably, with this material,
there was no shift in the photoemission threshold towards
higher energies, but only a global shift in QE, see Fig. 4.
This might be due to the lower afﬁnity of rubidium to the
residual gas. Detailed investigations are necessary to clar-
ify this.

QE at 266 nm dropped from 4.3 % to 1.2 %. In addition, the
photoemission threshold was shifted from 3.9 eV to 4.1 eV.
A long-term storage test showed no signiﬁcant difference
between uncoated and coated cathodes. More investiga-
tions will determine the usefulness of these protective lay-
ers.

2.5 Preparation with other wavelengths

In order to increase the sensitivity of the on-line QE mea-
surement during evaporation of the photocathodes, we
monitored the process with light at a wavelength of 320 nm.
We did not see any signiﬁcant improvement in sensitivity,
notably in the high QE region.

3 STOICHIOMETRIC RATIO

Film thicknesses are measured during the evaporation pro-
cess by a quartz oscillator [4]. Typical thicknesses for high
quantum efﬁciencies at λ = 266 nm are 10 nm of tellurium
and around 15 nm of cesium. This results in a ratio of the
number of atoms of each species of NT e/NC s = 2.85, far
from the stoichiometric ratio of 0.5 for Cs2Te. It is known
that tellurium interacts strongly with copper [7], so that not
all of the evaporated tellurium is available for a compound
with subsequently evaporated cesium. Therefore, we used
also Mo and Au as substrate material. However, the ratio
between the constituents necessary for optimum QE, did
not change signiﬁcantly. Another reason might be that in-
stead of Cs2Te, Cs2Te5 is catalytically produced on the sur-
face. This compound, as well as some others, was found to
be stable [8].

4 LIFETIME IN CTF II

Lifetime in CTF depends on parameters like maximum
ﬁeld strength on the cathode, vacuum and especially ex-
tracted charge. Typically, a cathode is removed from the
gun, if the QE falls below 1.5 %. As shown in Fig. 6, life-
time does not depend on the initial QE; a cathode having
an initial QE of 15 % (round points) lasted as long as one
with 5 % (triangles).

5 HIGH CHARGE TEST

As shown in Table 1, the average current produced in CTF
II is nearly a factor 10000 lower than what is required for
the CLIC drive beam. A test to produce 1 mC is under
preparation in the photoemission laboratory at CERN. The
exact reproduction of the CLIC pulse structure would re-
quire the CLIC laser, which is still in the design stage in

a collaboration between Rutherford Appleton Laboratory
and CERN. A test which is compatible with our current in-
stallation is the production of 1 mA of dc current, which re-
quires a UV laser power of 300 mW at the cathode. For this
test, we will illuminate the cathode with pulses of 100 ns to
150 ns pulse length, at repetition rates between 1 kHz and
6 kHz. As Table 1 shows, this is a factor 1000 more aver-
age current than in CTF II, and also demonstrates the basic
ability of the cathodes to produce the CTF 3 drive beam
(I=26µA). CLIC is still a factor 75 away. We are currently
searching for ways to produce higher charges as well.

6 CONCLUSION

Measurements of QE against photon energy are routinely
made after production and after use of photocathodes. We
have demonstrated that both low energy and high energy re-
sponses agree well with Spicer’s theory. A gold buffer layer
reduces the low energy response of Cs-Te cathodes. More
work is needed to understand the measurements of the sto-
ichiometric ratio of Cs-Te. Coating with 2 nm CsBr signif-
icantly decreased the quantum efﬁciency, without improv-
ing the storage lifetime. For the high-charge drive beam of
CLIC, it is still necessary to demonstrate the capabilities of
Cs-Te, for which ﬁrst tests will be done soon.

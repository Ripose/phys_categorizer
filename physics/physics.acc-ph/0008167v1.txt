A major consideration in the design of the accelerator
structures in the injector linacs of the JLC/NLC[1] is to
keep the wakeﬁeld effects within tolerances for both the
nominal (2.8 ns) and alternate (1.4 ns) bunch spacings. One
important multi-bunch wakeﬁeld effect is beam break-up
(BBU), where a jitter in injection conditions of a bunch
train is ampliﬁed in the linac; another is static emittance
growth caused by structure misalignments.

The injector linacs comprise the prelinac, the e+ drive
linac, the e− booster, and the e+ booster. The ﬁrst three
will operate at S-band, the last one, at L-band. Compared to
the main (X–band) linac, the wakes will tend to be smaller
by a factor 1/64 and 1/512, respectively, for the S– and L–
band linacs. This reduction, however,—especially for the
S-band machines—, by itself, is not sufﬁcient. Two ways
of reducing the wake effects further are to detune the ﬁrst
pass-band dipole modes and to damp them. In this report
our goal is to design the accelerator structures for the in-
jector linacs using detuning alone, an option that is simpler
than including damping. We will consider only the effects
of modes in the ﬁrst dipole pass-band, whose strengths
overwhelmingly dominate. The effects of the higher pass-
band modes, however, will need to be addressed in the fu-
ture. For a more detailed version of this work see Ref. [2].
Note that the design of the e+ booster structure, which is
straightforward, will not be discussed here.

Machine properties for the injector linacs are given in
Table 1. Shown are the initial and ﬁnal energies E0, Ef ,
the machine length L, the initial (vertical) beta function
averaged over a lattice cell ¯β0, and the parameter ζ for
a rough ﬁtting of the beta function to ¯β ∼ Eζ. The rf
frequencies are sub–harmonics of 11.424 GHz. As for
beam properties, for the nominal bunch train conﬁgura-
tion (95 bunches spaced at 2.8 ns), the particles per bunch
N = 1.20, 1.45, 1.45, 1.60 × 1010 and normalized emit-
tance ǫyn = 3× 10−8, 10−4, 10−4, .06 rm, for the prelinac,
e+ drive, e− booster, and e+ booster, respectively. For the
alternate conﬁguration (190 bunches spaced at 1.4 ns) N is
reduced by 1/√2.

2.1 Beam Break-Up (BBU)
In analogy to single-bunch BBU in a linac[3], multi-bunch
BBU can also be characterized by a strength parameter, but
one dependent on bunch number m:

Υm =

e2N LSm ¯β0

g(Ef /E0, ζ)

[m = 1, . . . , M ] ,

(1)

with M the number of bunches in a train. The sum wake

Sm =

Xi=1

W [(m − i)∆t]

[m = 1, . . . , M ] ,

(2)

with W the transverse wakeﬁeld and ∆t the time interval
between bunches in a train. The wake, in turn, is given by
a sum over the dipole modes in the accelerator structures:

W (t) =

,

(3)

with t time and Nm the number of modes; fn, kn, and
Qn are, respectively, the frequency, the kick factor, and the
quality factor of the nth mode. The function g(x) in Eq. 1
depends on the focusing proﬁle in the linac. Assuming the
beta function varies as ¯β ∼ Eζ,

x − 1 (cid:19)

[ ¯β ∼ Eζ ].

If Υm, for all m, is not large, the linear approximation
applies, and this parameter directly gives the (normalized)
growth in amplitude of bunch m. The projected (normal-
ized) emittance growth of the bunch train then becomes
(assuming, for simplicity, that, in phase space, the beam el-
lipse is initially upright) δǫ ≈ 1
y0, with Υrms0
the rms with respect to 0 of the strength parameter, y0 the
initial bunch offset, and σy0 the initial beam size. As jitter
tolerance parameter, rt, we can take that ratio y0/σy0 that
yields a tolerable emittance growth, δǫt.
2.2 Misalignments
If the structures in the linac are (statically) misaligned with
respect to a straight line, the beam at the end will have
an increased projected emittance.
If we have an ensem-
ble of misaligned linacs then, to ﬁrst order, the distribution
in emittance growth at the end of these linacs is given by
an exponential distribution exp[−δǫ/hδǫi]/hδǫi, with[4]
phδǫi =

with La the structure length, (xa)rms the rms of the struc-
ture misalignments, Srms the rms of the sum wake with
respect to the average, and Na the number of structures;
the function h is given by (again assuming ¯β ∼ Eζ):

h(x, ζ) =s 1

ζx(cid:18) xζ − 1
x − 1 (cid:19)

[ ¯β ∼ Eζ ].

Eq. 5 is valid assuming the so-called betratron term in
the equation of motion is small compared to the mis-
alignment term. We can deﬁne a misalignment tolerance:

tance growth.

xat = (xa)rmspδǫt/hδǫi, with δǫt the tolerance in emit-

We are also interested in the tolerance to cell-to-cell mis-
alignments caused by fabrication errors. A structure is built
as a collection of cups, one for each cell, that is brazed to-
gether, and there will be errors, small compared to the cell
dimensions, in the straightness of each structure. To gener-
ate a wake (for a beam on-axis) in a structure with cell-to-
cell misalignments we use a perturbation approach based
on the eigenmodes of the unperturbed structure[5][2].

3 WAKEFIELD DESIGN

Reducing emittance growth requires reducing the sum
wake. In the main (X-band) linac of the NLC, the strat-
egy to do this is to use Gaussian detuning to generate a fast
Gaussian fall-off in the wakeﬁeld envelope; in particular,
at the position of the second bunch the wake is reduced by
roughly 2 orders of magnitude from its initial value. At
the lower frequencies of the injector linacs we have fewer
oscillations between bunches and this strategy requires too
much detuning. Instead, we will follow a strategy that puts
early bunches on zero crossings of the wake, by a proper
choice of the average frequency. As for the distribution of
mode frequencies, we will aim for a uniform distribution,
for which the wake is (for π ¯f t/Q small):

2¯k
Nm

W ≈

sin(2π ¯f t)

sin(π ¯f t∆δf )

sin(π ¯f t∆δf /Nm)

,

(7)

with Nm the number of modes, ¯k the average kick factor, ¯f
the average frequency, and ∆δf the full width of the distri-
bution. The wake envelope initially drops with t as a sinc
function, but eventually resurges again, to a maximum at
t = Nm/( ¯f ∆δf ).

For the 2nd bunch to sit on the zero crossing requires
that ¯f ∆t = n/2, with n an integer. For S-band, given
our implementation of the SLED-I pulse compression sys-
tem, the optimal rf efﬁciency is obtained when the average
dipole mode frequency is 4.012 GHz. For this case, with
the alternate (1.4 ns) bunch spacing, ¯f ∆t = 5.62. The
half-integer is achieved by changing ¯f by −2%, a change
which, however, results in a net loss of 7% in accelerating
gradient. One way of avoiding this loss is to reduce the
group velocity by increasing the phase advance per cell of
the fundamental mode from the nominal 2π/3. In fact, we
ﬁnd that by going to 3π/4 phase advance we can recapture
this loss in gradient.

For the resurgence in the wake to occur after the bunch
train has passed requires that ∆δf be signiﬁcantly less than
Nm/(M ¯f ∆t), which, in our case, is about 10%. Another
possibility for pushing the resurgence to larger t is to use
two structure types, which can effectively double the num-
ber of modes available for detuning. This idea has been
studied; it has been rejected in that it requires tight align-
ment tolerances between pairs of such structures.
3.1 Optimization
The cells in a structure are coupled to each other, and to
obtain the wakeﬁeld we need to solve for the eigenmodes
of the system. We obtain these numerically using a double-
band circuit model [6]. The computer program we use gen-
erates 2Nc coupled mode frequencies fn and kick factors
kn, with Nc the number of cells in a structure. It assumes
the modes are trapped at the ends of the structure. We will
use only the ﬁrst Nc modes (those of the ﬁrst pass-band)
for our wakeﬁeld since they overwhelmingly dominate and
since those of the second band are not obtained accurately.
The constants (circuit elements) for the program are ob-
tained by ﬁtting to results of a 2D electromagnetic program
OMEGA2[7] applied to representative cell geometries, and
then using interpolation. Here we consider structures of the
disk–loaded type, with rounded irises. The iris and cav-
ity radii are adjusted to give the correct fundamental mode
frequency and the desired synchronous dipole mode fre-
quency. Therefore, cell m can be speciﬁed by one free
parameter, the synchronous frequency (of the ﬁrst dipole
mode pass-band). The 3π/4 S-band structure consists of
102 cells with a cell period of 3.94 cm, iris thickness of
0.584 cm, and cavity radius ∼ 4.2 cm; the Q due to wall
losses (copper) ∼ 14, 500. Fig. 1 shows the ﬁrst two dis-
persion curves of representative cell geometries (for iris
radii from 1.30 to 2.00 cm). The plotting symbols give the
OMEGA2 results, the curves, those of the circuit program.

Figure 1: The dispersion curves of the ﬁrst two dipole
bands of representative cells in a 3π/4 structure.

We will consider a uniform input (synchronous) fre-
quency distribution, but with a slanting top. This leaves
us with 3 parameters to vary: the (relative) shift in aver-
age frequency (from a nominal 4.012 GHz) δ ¯f, the (rela-
tive) width of the distribution ∆δf , and the tilt parameter α
(−1 ≤ α ≤ 1, with α = 1 giving a right triangle distribu-
tion with positive slope). Varying these parameters we cal-
culate Srms0 and Srms for the coupled modes, and for both

bunch train conﬁgurations, and we optimize. We ﬁnd that a
fairly optimal case consists of δ ¯f = −2.3%, ∆δf = 5.8%,
and α = −0.20, where Srms0 = Srms = .004 MV/nC/m2.
In Fig. 2 we show the dependence of Srms0 on δ ¯f and ∆δf
near the optimum.

Figure 2: Srms0 [MV/nC/m2] vs.
optimum, for ∆t = 2.8 ns (solid) and 1.4 ns (dashes).

δ ¯f and ∆δf near

In Fig. 3 we display, for the optimal case, the frequency
distribution (a), the kick factors (b), and the envelope of
the wake (c). The dashed curves in (a) and (b) give the syn-
chronous (input) values. The plotting symbols in (c) give
|W| at the bunch positions for the alternate (1.4 ns) bunch
train conﬁguration. In (b) we see no spikes, thanks to the
fact that the synchronous point is near pi, and, serendipi-
tously, f0 < fπ for cell geometries near the beginning of
the structure, f0 > fπ for those near the end[6]. (Note that
for the optimized 2π/3 structure, for which f0 > fπ for
all cell geometries, there is such a spike, and consequently
Srms0 is 5 times larger than here[2].) From (c) we note
that many of the earlier bunches have wakes with ampli-
tudes signiﬁcantly below the wake envelope.

Figure 3: Results for the optimal 3π/4 structure.

3.2 Frequency Errors
Errors in cell manufacturing will result in frequency errors.
In Fig. 4 we give Srms0 and Srms, when a random error
component is added to the (input) synchronous frequencies
of the optimal distribution (each plotting symbol, with its
error bars, represents 400 seeds). With a frequency spac-
ing of ∼ 8 × 10−4, an rms frequency error of 1 × 10−4
is a relatively small perturbation, and for the 1.4 ns bunch
spacing its effect is small, whereas for the 2.8 ns spacing
it is not. The reason is that in the former case the beam
sits on the half-integer resonance (which is benign), while

in the latter case it sits on the integer (which is not)[2]. As
to the effect in a linac, let us distinguish two types of er-
rors: “systematic random” and “purely random” errors; by
the former we mean errors, random in one structure, that
are repeated in all structures of the linac; by the latter we
mean random also from structure to structure. We expect
the effect of a purely random error, of say, 10−4 (which we
think is achievable) to be similar to a systematic random er-
ror of 10−4/√Na. Na = 140, 127, 41 in, respectively, the
prelinac, the e+ drive linac, and the e− booster; therefore
the appropriate abscissas in the ﬁgure become .8, .9, and
1.6 × 10−5. At these points, for the 2.8 ns spacing, we see
that Srms0 is only a factor 2 ± 1, 2 ± 1, 3 ± 2 times larger
than the error-free result.

Figure 4: The effect of random frequency errors.

4 TOLERANCES

To obtain tolerances we performed particle tracking using
LIAR[8] and compare the results with the analytical for-
mulas given in Sec. 2. We take δǫt = 10% as accept-
able. For BBU the tightest tolerance is for the e+ booster,
where rt is 3.8 (2.2) analytically, 5.5 (3.0) numerically, for
∆t = 2.8 (1.4) ns. For misalignments the tightest tolerance
is for the prelinac, where xat is 2.9 (4.6) mm analytically,
3.2 (4.8) mm numerically. (For the other machines these
tolerances are & 10 times looser.) Purely random machin-
ing errors, equivalent to 10−4 frequency errors, will tighten
these results by 50-100%, but they are still very loose.

Finally, what is the random, cell-to-cell misalignment
tolerance? Performing the perturbation calculation men-
tioned earlier for 1000 different random structures, we ﬁnd
that Srms = .27 ± .12 (.032 ± .003) MV/nC/m2 for
∆t = 2.8 (1.4) ns. We again see the effect of the integer
resonance on the 2.8 ns option result. For the prelinac the
cell-to-cell misalignment tolerance becomes 40 (600) µm
for the 2.8 (1.4) ns conﬁguration.

linac meetings at SLAC for comments and suggestions.

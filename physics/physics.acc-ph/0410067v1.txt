Polarized antiprotons can be produced in a storage ring by spin–dependent interaction in a purely
electron–polarized hydrogen gas target. The polarizing process is based on spin transfer from the
polarized electrons of the target atoms to the orbiting antiprotons. After spin ﬁltering for about two
beam lifetimes at energies T ≈ 40−170 MeV using a dedicated large acceptance ring, the antiproton
beam polarization would reach P = 0.2 − 0.4. Polarized antiprotons would open new and unique
research opportunities for spin–physics experiments in ¯pp interactions.

For more than two decades, physicists have tried to
produce beams of polarized antiprotons. Conventional
methods like atomic beam sources (ABS), appropriate for
the production of polarized protons and heavy ions can-
not be applied, since antiprotons annihilate with matter.
Polarized antiprotons have been produced from the decay
in ﬂight of ¯Λ hyperons at Fermilab. The achieved inten-
sities with antiproton polarizations P > 0.35 never ex-
ceeded 1.5·105 s−1 [1]. Scattering of antiprotons oﬀ a liq-
uid hydrogen target could yield polarizations of P ≈ 0.2,
with beam intensities of up to 2 · 103 s−1 [2]. Unfortu-
nately, both approaches do not allow eﬃcient accumu-
lation in a storage ring, which would greatly enhance
the luminosity. Spin splitting using the Stern–Gerlach
separation of the given magnetic substates in a stored
antiproton beam was proposed in 1985 [3]. Although the
theoretical understanding has much improved since then
[4], spin splitting using a stored beam has yet to be ob-
served experimentally.

Interest in the polarization of antiprotons has recently
been stimulated by a proposal to build a High Energy
Storage Ring (HESR) for antiprotons at the new Fa-
cility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) at the
Gesellschaft f¨ur Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darm-
stadt [5]. A Letter–of–Intent for spin–physics experi-
ments has been submitted by the PAX collaboration [6]
to employ a polarized antiproton beam incident on a po-
larized internal storage cell target [7]. A beam of polar-
ized antiprotons would enable new experiments, such as
the ﬁrst direct measurement of the transversity distribu-
tion of the valence quarks in the proton, a test of the
predicted opposite sign of the Sivers–function — related
to the quark distribution inside a transversely polarized
nucleon — in Drell–Yan as compared to semi–inclusive
deep–inelastic scattering, and a ﬁrst measurement of the
moduli and the relative phase of the time–like electric
and magnetic form factors GE,M of the proton [6].

In 1992 an experiment at the Test Storage Ring (TSR)
at MPI Heidelberg showed that an initially unpolarized

stored 23 MeV proton beam can be polarized by spin–
dependent interaction with a polarized hydrogen gas tar-

protons with m = 1
2 are scattered less often, than those
with m = − 1
2 , which eventually caused the stored beam
to acquire a polarization parallel to the proton spin of
the hydrogen atoms during spin ﬁltering. In an analy-
sis by Meyer three diﬀerent mechanisms were identiﬁed,
that add up to the measured result [11]. One of these
mechanisms is spin transfer from the polarized electrons
of the hydrogen gas target to the circulating protons.
Horowitz and Meyer derived the spin transfer cross sec-
tion p + ~e → ~p + e (using c = ~ = 1) [12],

wave function at the origin. The Coulomb parameter η
is given by η = −zα/v (for antiprotons, η is positive). z
is the beam charge number and v the relative velocity of
particle and projectile in the laboratory system.

In the following we evaluate a concept for a dedicated
antiproton polarizer ring (AP). Antiprotons would be po-
larized by the spin–dependent interaction in an electron–
polarized hydrogen gas target. This spin–transfer pro-
cess is calculable, whereas, due to the absence of polar-
ized antiproton beams in the past, a measurement of
the spin–dependent ¯pp interaction is still lacking, and
only theoretical models exist [13]. The polarized an-
tiprotons would be subsequently transferred to an exper-
imental storage ring (ESR) for measurements (Fig. 1).
Both the AP and the ESR should be operated as syn-
chrotrons with electron cooling to counteract emittance
growth. In both rings the beam polarization should be

preserved during acceleration without loss [14]. The lon-
gitudinal spin–transfer cross section is twice as large as
the transverse one [11], σek = 2 · σe⊥ , the stable spin
direction of the beam at the location of the polarizing
target should therefore be longitudinal as well, which re-
quires a Siberian snake in a straight section opposite the
polarizing target [15].

A hydrogen gas target of suitable substate popula-
tion represents a dense target of quasi–free electrons
of high polarization and areal density. Such a target
can be produced by injection of two hyperﬁne states
2 , mI = + 1
with magnetic quantum numbers |mJ = + 1
2 i
and | + 1
2 i into a strong longitudinal magnetic hold-
ing ﬁeld of about B|| = 300 mT. The maximum elec-
tron and nuclear target polarizations in such a ﬁeld are
Qe = 0.993 and Qz = 0.007 [16]. Polarized atomic beam
sources presently produce a ﬂux of hydrogen atoms of
about q = 1.2 · 1017 atoms/s in two hyperﬁne states [17].
Our model calculation for the polarization buildup as-
sumes a moderate improvement of 20%, i.e. a ﬂow of
q = 1.5 · 1017 atoms/s.

The beam lifetime in the AP can be expressed as func-
tion of the Coulomb–Loss cross section ∆σC and the total
hadronic ¯pp cross section σtot,

can be derived analytically in terms of the square of the
total energy s by integration of the Rutherford cross sec-
tion, taking into account that only those particles are lost
that undergo scattering at angles larger than Ψacc,

The optimum beam energies for diﬀerent acceptance
angles at which the polarization buildup works best, how-
ever, cannot be obtained from the maxima in Fig. 3. In
order to ﬁnd these energies, one has to evaluate at which
beam energies the FOM [Eq. (8)], depicted in Fig. 4,
reaches a maximum. The optimum beam energies for po-
larization buildup in the AP are listed in Table II. The
limitations due to space–charge, N AP

10)], are visible as kinks in Fig. 4 for the acceptance
angles Ψacc = 40 and 50 mrad, however, the optimum
energies are not aﬀected by space–charge.

Spin ﬁltering in a pure electron target greatly reduces
the beam losses, because σtot disappears and Coulomb
scattering angles in ¯pe collisions do not exceed Ψacc of
any storage ring. With stationary electrons stored in
a Penning trap, densities of about 1012 electrons/cm2
may be reached in the future [21]. A typical electron

A = 1 cm2 cross section, and l = 5 m length reaches
dt = Ie · l · (βlab c A)−1 = 5.2 · 108 electrons/cm2, which
is six orders of magnitude short of the electron densi-
ties achievable with a neutral hydrogen gas target. For
a pure electron target the spin transfer cross section is
σe|| = 670 mb (at T = 6.2 MeV) [12], about a factor 15
larger than the cross sections associated to the optimum
energies using a gas target (Table II). One can therefore
conclude that with present day technologies, both above
discussed alternatives are no match for spin ﬁltering us-
ing a polarized gas target.

In order to estimate the luminosities available for the
ESR, we use the parameters of the HESR (LHESR =
440 m). After spin ﬁltering in the AP for topt = 2 · τAP,
the number of polarized antiprotons transfered to HESR
is N AP
(t = 0)/e2 [Eq. (9)]. The beam lifetime in the
¯p
HESR at T = 15 GeV for an internal polarized hydrogen
gas target of dt = 7 · 1014 cm−2 is about τHESR = 12 h
[Eqs. (2, 5)], where the target parameters from Table I
were used, a cell diameter dbeam = 0.8 cm, and σtot =
50 mb. Subsequent transfers from the AP to the HESR
can be employed to accumulate antiprotons. Eventu-
ally, since τHESR is ﬁnite, the average number of an-
= R/e2 · τHESR =
tiprotons reaches equilibrium, N HESR
5.6 · 1010, independent of τAP. An average luminosity of
¯L = R/(e2 · σtot) = 2.7 · 1031 cm−2s−1 can be achieved,
with antiproton beam polarizations depending on the AP
acceptance angle Ψacc (Table II).

¯p

We have shown that with a dedicated large acceptance
antiproton polarizer ring (Ψacc = 10 to 50 mrad), beam
polarizations of P = 0.2 to 0.4 could be reached. The
energies at which the polarization buildup works best
range from T = 40 to 170 MeV. In equilibrium, the aver-
age luminosity for double–polarization experiments in an
experimental storage ring (e.g. HESR) after subsequent
transfers from the AP could reach ¯L = 2.7·1031 cm−2s−1.
The antiproton polarizer, discussed here, would pro-
vide highly polarized antiproton beams of unprecedented
quality. In particular the implementation of this option
at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research would
open new and unique research opportunities for spin–
physics experiments in ¯pp interactions at the HESR.

A narrow plane cut near the crystal surface increases the probability of capture into
the stable channeling motion up to 99 percent

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

It is shown that a narrow plane cut near the crystal surface considerably increases the probability
of capture into the stable channeling motion of positively charged particles entering a crystal at
angles smaller than a quarter of the critical channeling angle with respect to the crystal planes.
At smallest incidence angles the capture probability reaches 99 percent. A pair of crystals with
cuts bent in orthogonal planes allows to reach a 99.9 percent eﬃciency of single-pass deﬂection of a
proton beam with an ultra small divergence. Conditions necessary for eﬃcient single-pass deﬂection
of protons from the LHC beam halo are discussed.

The phenomenon of positively charged particle chan-
neling in crystals has already found several applications
in high energy physics. In particular, the deﬂection of
channeling protons and ions by bent crystals is widely
used for beam extraction from high-energy accelerators
[1, 2] as well as opens up a possibility to increase the ef-
ﬁciency of beam halo cleaning at the stage of LHC lumi-
nosity upgrade [1]. Next, the radiation of channeling par-
ticles, in that number, in crystal undulators [3, 4, 5, 6],
allows to generate bright gamma-beams. Both planar
and axial channeling can be also used for positron radia-
tive cooling [7].

ions which we will not mention further for short) most
intensively scattered by nuclei. To change the situa-
tion and to reach a 99% eﬃciency of proton capture into
the stable channeling motion we suggest in this letter to
use a narrow plane cut near the crystal entrance surface
shown in Fig. 1. Similar cuts, widely used in channel-
cut monochromators, preserve a single crystal structure
on the cut opposite sides. In other words, atomic planes
behind the cut are direct continuations of that ones in
front of it.

FIG. 1: A narrow cut between the planes z = z1 and z = z2,
which preserves a single crystal structure in front and behind

ergy.

The eﬃciency of all these applications is restricted by
an incomplete beam capture into the regime of stable
channeling motion, the probability of which hardly ex-
ceeds 85% even for zero beam divergence because of the
fast dechanneling of, at least, 15% of protons (positrons,

namely v1 > 0 at 0 < x0 < d/2 and v1 < 0 at

passing through the cut, they drift towards the channel
center (see Fig. 3c). As a result, entering the crystal
behind the cut the protons acquire smaller potential en-
ergy V (x2) than the potential energy V (x1) they lose at

Of course, such a transverse energy reduction is possi-
ble if the proton incidence angle ϑ0 = v0/vk is suﬃciently
small. Here v0 = vx(z = 0) and vk are, respectively,
the initial transverse and average longitudinal velocity
components. We will retain the later in the formulas to
make them valid both in relativistic and nonrelativistic
cases. In order to estimate the necessary ϑ0 value one
can, ﬁrst, conjecture that to make a transverse kinetic
energy εv2
1/2 suﬃciently small (say, less than a quarter of
the planar potential amplitude Vmax, reserving another
quarter for the potential energy), the angle ϑ1 = v1/vk
should not exceed a half of the critical channeling an-
gle θch =
2Vmax/ε, where ε is the total proton energy.
Second, in order not to considerably change the angle ϑ1,
at least, its sign, the incidence angle ϑ0 should be con-
siderably (say, twice) less than ϑ1. Combining these two
arguments one comes to the condition

To obtain Eq.

of eﬃcient dechanneling probability reduction by the cut.
(1) more rigorously let us develop a
simple model of the transverse energy reduction by the
cut. Consider a proton entering a crystal with a trans-
verse velocity v0 in a point x0 located in the high nuclear
density region. Such a proton possesses a transverse en-
ergy ε⊥ = εv2
0/2 + V (x0) close to Vmax – see Fig. 2.
After passing through the crystal plate separated by the
cut, the proton acquires a coordinate x1 and a velocity
v1. Entering then the cut, it loses the potential energy
V (x1), passes freely through the cut with the constant
velocity v1, and acquires a transverse coordinate

FIG. 4: Dependencies of the proton transverse energy at z =
0 (dashed) and z = z2 (solid curves) on the initial proton
coordinate at diﬀerent angles of proton incidence with respect
to the (110) Si plane.

The results of such an evolution simulated for three
incidence angles ϑ0 using the Moliere approximation for
the averaged planar potential are illustrated by Fig. 4. A
comparison of the solid and dashed curves demonstrates
an eﬃcient ε′
⊥ reduction by the cut in the regions of high
nuclear density. At ϑ0 < θch/4 this reduction allows
to reach ε′
⊥ < Vmax/2 and, thus, to avoid fast dechan-
neling by 98-99% of the protons while the rest 1-2% of
them form sharp peaks at x0 = xp and quickly dechannel.
Though the origin of these ”dechanneling peaks” can not
be explained using the approximation (4), Eqs. (7) and
(10) correctly describe the ϑ0 dependence of the maxi-
mum ε′
⊥ value reached outside the peaks. In particular,
one can see that ε′
12.2eV at

ϑ0 slightly exceeding θch/4.

both cases the protons quickly joint the process of trans-

The probability (15) will be even lower if the protons
eﬀectively dechannel in a relatively short crystal at higher

Eq. (15) predicts in this case that Pdech = 2.29% and

Thus, the cut reduces the transverse energy of 98-99%
of protons of a beam with divergence (1) down to the level
securing their stable channeling motion. The rest 1-2% of
the protons avoid eﬃcient energy reduction and dechan-
nel fast. This picture manifests itself independently of
the proton energy provided the cut coordinates which
are, naturally, energy dependent, are chosen according
to Eqs. (8) and (9). Thus, to illustrate the general fea-
tures of the cut functioning by Monte Carlo simulations
any proton energy may be chosen. Let us therefore con-
sider the LHC proton deﬂection by bent crystals as the
most challenging channeling application.

In the circumstances the fast dechaneling becomes the
only obstacle impeding an eﬃcient single pass proton de-
ﬂection and since the cut drastically reduces the number
of quickly dechaneling protons, its use has to make an
eﬃcient single pass deﬂection possible.

To demonstrate this we simulated the 7T eV LHC pro-
ton deﬂection by a 1 cm Si crystal with 100m bending
radius and cut coordinates z1 = 17µm and z2 = 71µm
evaluated using Eqs.
(8) and (9). To make the sim-
ulation process more adequate and eﬃcient we treated
the large-angle single Coulomb scattering separately from
the small-angle multiple one. The angular distribution
of protons in the incident beam was assumed to be both
Gaussian and cylindrically symmetric. The simulated de-
pendence of the dechanneling fraction on the root mean
square (r.m.s.) divergence angle ϑrms is given in Fig. 5.
On the average the cut begins to suppress the dechan-
neling process starting from ϑrms
0.34θch
while the highest eﬃciency of its use is reached at ϑrms
≤
0.1θch when the dechanneling probability de-
0.3µrad
creases down to 1% as predicted by the analytical model.

FIG. 5: Dependence of the 7 TeV proton dechanneling prob-
ability in a 1 cm bent Si crystal with (solid) and without
(dashed curve) the cut on the r.m.s. incidence angle.

In previous deﬂection experiments the low capture
probability was predetermined simultaneously by the
high incident beam divergence, relatively thick amor-
phous near-surface crystal layer and fast dechaneling of
protons moving in the regions of high nuclear density. At
low capture probability a high deﬂection eﬃciency could
be realized only in the multi-pass mode [1, 2]. How-
ever the divergence of the beam fraction encountering a
crystal placed in the beam halo of a high energy proton
accelerator can, in fact, be made very low [8, 9]. The
amorphous layer also can be made as thin as 0.01µm [1].

FIG. 6: A pair of 1 cm Si and Ge crystals with cuts bent in
orthogonal planes with 100m bending radii allows to reach a
99.9% single-pass proton deﬂection eﬃciency at the LHC.

The simulations also show that the protons dechan-
neled in the crystal which is bent in horizontal xz plane
acquires a r.m.s. divergence angle of about 0.7µrad in
the vertical yz plane. Such a divergence allows to use a
second crystal bent in the yz plane to deﬂect about 90%
of these protons, as is shown in Fig. 6. Though the high
beam divergence impedes the dechanneling suppression
by the cut, a combined single-pass deﬂection eﬃciency
by a pair of Si and Ge crystals with cuts approaches
99.9%. Both the single passage though the crystal and
the proton moving oﬀ the high nuclear density regions
will drastically diminish the rate of nuclear reactions ac-
companying the proton deﬂection by crystals with cuts.

Thus, to reach a really high single-pass deﬂection eﬃ-
ciency the beam divergence angle has not to exceed much
0.1µrad. The angle which the proton beam axis forms
with the crystal planes must be of the same order of
value. Since the best goniometers allow to position a
crystal only with a microradian accuracy, the necessary
beam alignment along the crystal planes can most easily
be reached by a proton deﬂection by a magnetic ﬁeld with
the typical integral value of only 0.01T
m which should
be adjusted to maximize the deﬂection probability.

·

The symmetry of the cut region from Fig. 1 prevents
the dusturbance of ε⊥ reduction process by a distortion
accompanying the cut formation. However the crystal
bending in the horizontal plane violates the symmetry
and can distort the cut region upsetting the ε⊥ reduc-
tion process. The simplest possibility to avoid such a
distortion is to leave the cut region straight, starting the
crystal bending at z > z2. To prevent the distortion
of the cut region if it is nevertheless bent we suggest to
tightly ﬁx a crystal plane or set of planes with random
crystal structure orientation and elastic properties iden-
tical to that of the removed crystal plane inside the cut.
The method of high-resolution x-ray scattering [10] can
be used to check both the crystal plane matching and
alignment on the opposite sides of the cut.

Note brieﬂy that the reduction of both the dechannel-
ing probability and averaged transverse energy by the
cut fabricated in the crystals used to generate either
usual channeling radiation or channelled positron radia-
tion from crystal undulators [3, 4, 5, 6] will diminish the
intensity of radiation from non channeled positrons, make
the radiation spectrum more narrow, increase the eﬀec-
tively used crystal length and reduce the rate of positron
interaction with nuclei.

The positron transverse energy reduction by the cut
also allows to increase the number of positrons involved in
the process of radiative cooling being eﬀective only in the

5

regions of negligible nuclear density [7]. Note that the cut
can be used to improve the eﬃciency of radiative cooling
both in the planar and axial cases. At that the two-
dimensional distribution of both the nuclear density and
averaged potential allows to reach even higher reduction
of the quickly dechaneling proton or positron fraction in
the axial case than in the planar one.

Note also that the cut application to the case of neg-
atively charged particles will, on the opposite, several
times and more increase the dechanneling and nuclear
reaction probabilities both in planar and axial cases.

In principle, dechanneling probability reduction by the
cut can both increase the depth and modify the proﬁle
of non relativistic ion implantation. However the small
100nm will seriously complicate the
lengths z1,2
cut production. A crystalline surface layer with low av-
erage atomic number can be used instead of such narrow
cuts. The crystal planes of this layer also have to be the
direct continuations of that in the crystal. A vast expe-
rience in heterostructure growth [11] allows one to argue
that a high quality GaAl layer can be produced on a Ge
crystal most readily.

To summarize, the fabrication of a narrow plane cut
near the crystal surface allows to ten times and more
decrease both the dechanneling probability and nuclear
reaction rate of positively charged particles in crystals.
This possibility can many times increase the eﬃciency
of both the beam deﬂection and halo cleaning at proton
and ion colliders, of the gamma-quantum emission by
positrons in crystal undulators and of the positron beam
cooling.

Abstract
An interpretation of the formation of halo in accelerators based on quantum-like theory by a diﬀraction model is given
in terms of the transversal beam motion. Physical implications of the longitudinal dynamics are also examined.
Keywords: Beam Physics, Quantum-like, Halo, Beam Losses, Protons, Ions.

I. INTRODUCTION

A possible way of describing the evolution of a high density beam is the so-called quantum-like approach [1], where
one considers a time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation, in both the usual linear and the less usual nonlinear form,
as a ﬂuid equation for the whole beam. In this case the squared modulus of the wave function (named beam wave
function) gives the distribution function of the particles in space at a certain time [2]. The Schr¨odinger equation may
be taken in one or more spatial dimensions according to the particular physical problem; furthermore the motion of
the particles in the conﬁguration space can be considered as a Madelung ﬂuid if one chooses the equation in its linear
version.

Although the validity of the model relies only on experiments and on the new predictions, one may also invoke a
theoretical argument that could justify the Schr¨odinger quantum-like approach. We notice that the normalized emit-
tance ǫ with the dimension of an action is the natural choice in the quantum-like theory, the analogue of the Planck’s
constant ¯h because it reproduces the corresponding area in the phase-space of the particle. After linearizing the
Schr¨odinger-like equation, for beams in an accelerator, we can use the whole apparatus of quantum mechanics, keep-
ing in mind a new interpretation of the basic parameters. In particular one introduces the propagator K (xf , tf |xi, ti)
of the Feynman theory for both longitudinal and transversal motion. A procedure of this sort seems eﬀective for a
global description of several phenomena such as intrabeam scattering, space-charge, particle focusing, that cannot be
treated easily in detail by “classical mechanics”. One consequence of this procedure is to obtain information on the
creation of the Halo around the main beam line by the losses of particles due to the transversal collective motion.
Here we shall mainly consider the case of the HIDIF facility. The LHC has been discussed in [2].

Let us consider the Schr¨odinger like equation for the beam wave function

. Here ǫ is the normalized transversal beam
in the linearized case U (x, t) does not depend on the density |ψ|
emittance deﬁned as follows ǫ = m0cγβ˜ǫ, where ˜ǫ is the emittance usually considered, Let us now focus on the one
dimensional transversal motion along the x-axis of the beam particles belonging to a single bunch and assume a
Gaussian transversal proﬁle for particles injected into a circular machine. We want to try a description of interactions
that cannot be treated in detail, as a diﬀraction through a slit that becomes a phenomenological boundary in each
segment of the particle trajectory. The result is a multiple integral that determines the actual propagator between
the initial and ﬁnal states in terms of the space-time intervals due to the intermediate segments.

where τ = nτ ′ is the total time spent by the beam in the accelerator (total time of revolutions in circular machines),
T is the time necessary to insert the bunch (practically the time between two successive bunches) and (−b, +b) the
space interval deﬁning the boundary mentioned above. Obviously b and T are phenomenological parameters which
vary from a machine to another and must also have a strict correction with the geometry of the vacuum tube where
the particles circulate. We may notice that the convolution property (2) of the Feynman propagator allows us to
substitute the multiple integral (that becomes a functional integral for n −→ ∞ and τ ′ −→ 0) with the single integral

lations with frequency ω/2π

III. LONGITUDINAL MOTION

As far as the longitudinal motion is concerned the quantum-like approach appears to be quite appropriate to obtain
information on the modiﬁed length (and consequently the stability) of the bunches both in the linear and circular
accelerators. We introduce the Gaussian parameter b, as we did with the Gaussian slit e−
in the transversal
motion and look for a phenomenological solution of the equation for the beam wave function ψ

where ω is the synchrotron frequency, Λ represents the coupling with non-linear terms and x is the longitudinal
particle displacement with respect to the synchrotronous one. Numerical calculations for the HIDIF project are
shown in Table I.

IV. COMMENTS AND CONCLUSIONS

Transversal Motion: This use of a quantum-like approach appears a simple powerful tool for the analysis of the
evolution of a beam in linear & circular accelerators and storage rings. Indeed the introduction of a very limited

number of phenomenological parameters (in our simpliﬁed model the only parameter b) in the beam quantum-like
equations and the use of the Schr¨odinger-type solutions allow us to calculate how the bunches evolve and modify
owing to the forces (linear and non-linear) acting on the particles.

As far as the betatron oscillations are concerned the mechanism of the diﬀraction through a slit appears a very
adequate phenomenological approach. Indeed we can interpret the probability (local and total) for a particle leaving
its position as the mechanism of creating a halo around the main ﬂux.

The phenomenological parameter b represents several fundamental processes that are present in the beam
bunches (and play a determinant role in the creation of the halo) such as intrabeam scattering, beamstrahlung,
space-charge and imperfections in the magnets of the lattice that could cause non-linear perturbative eﬀects.

We like to recall here the analogy with the diﬀraction through a slit in optics where it represents a much more

complicated physical phenomenon based on the scattering of light against atomic electrons.

We remark now the following points

1. The total probability (per particle) calculated from the free particle propagator (P ) and from the harmonic

oscillator one (Pω) appear very near for the storage rings in HIDIF (and LHC).

2. The HIDIF scenario, as we expect because of the higher intensity, exhibits a total loss of particles (and beam
power) which is at least 103 times higher than LHC. The picture we have obtained for the transversal motion
is encouraging because the halo losses are under control. The estimated losses of the beam power appear much
smaller than the permissible 1 Watt/m.

Longitudinal motion The formula (5) can be used for calculating the motion of the length of the bunch related to
the synchrotron oscillations in both linear and circular machines. In this case we must consider only the propagator
of the harmonic oscillator which is the simplest linear version of the classical dynamical motion for the two canonical
conjugate variables that express the deviations of an arbitrary particle from the synchronous one namely the RF
phase diﬀerence ∆φ = φ − φs and the energy diﬀerence ∆E = E − Es. Our examples is the main LINAC in the
HIDIF project. The phenomenological Gaussian function e−
acquires a diﬀerent meaning from the one it had
in the transversal motion. Our analysis deals with a Gaussian longitudinal proﬁle and predicts a coasting beam in
LHC and a quite stable bunch in the main LINAC of HIDIF.

We may therefore conclude that our approach although preliminary is interesting and particular attention is required

in treating the longitudinal motion where the nonlinear space-charge forces are very important.

Numerical calculations for the HIDIF project are shown in Table I.

The case for a future high-energy collider based on muon beams is brieﬂy reviewed.

I. I WANT TO BELIEVE...

• That elementary particle physics will prosper for a 2nd century with laboratory experiments based on innovative

particle sources.

• That a full range of new phenomena will be investigated:

– mass ⇒ a 2nd 3 × 3 (or larger?) mixing matrix.
– Precision studies of Higgs bosons.
– A rich supersymmetric sector.
– ... And more ...

• That our investment in future accelerators will result in more cost-eﬀective technology, capable of extension to

10’s of TeV of constituent CoM energy.

• That a Muon Collider [1,2] based on ionization cooling is the best option to accomplish the above.

II. IONIZATION COOLING

(An Idea So Simple It Might Just Work)

• Ionization: takes momentum away.

• RF acceleration: puts momentum back along z axis.

• ⇒ Transverse “cooling”.

Particles are slowed along their path (dE/dx)

Particles are accelerated longitudinally

Origin: G.K. O’Neill (1956) [3].

• This won’t work for electrons or protons.

• So use muons: Balbekov [4], Budker [5], Skrinsky [6], late 1960’s.

III. THE DETAILS ARE DELICATE

Use channel of LH2 absorbers, rf cavities and alternating solenoids (to avoid buildup of angular momentum).
One cell of the cooling channel:

But, the energy spread rises due to “straggling”.
⇒ Must exchange longitudinal and transverse emittance frequently to avoid beam loss due to bunch spreading.
Can reduce energy spread by a wedge absorber at a momentum dispersion point:

Absorber wedge

Energy too high

Nominal energy

[6-D emittance constant (at best) in this process.]

Energy too low

 Equal energies

IV. WHAT IS A MUON COLLIDER?

An accelerator complex in which
• Muons (both µ+ and µ−) are collected from pion decay following a pN interaction.

• Muon phase volume is reduced by 106 by ionization cooling.

• The cooled muons are accelerated and then stored in a ring.

• µ+µ− collisions are observed over the useful muon life of ≈ 1000 turns at any energy.

• Intense neutrino beams and spallation neutron beams are

available as byproducts.

Muons decay: µ → eν

⇒

• Must cool muons quickly (stochastic cooling won’t do).

• Detector backgrounds at LHC level.

• Potential personnel hazard from ν interactions.

A First Muon Collider to study light-Higgs production:

V. THE CASE FOR A MUON COLLIDER

• More aﬀordable than an e+e− collider at the TeV (LHC) scale.

• More aﬀordable than either a hadron or an e+e− collider for (eﬀective) energies beyond the LHC.

• Precision initial state superior even to e+e− .

Muon polarization ≈ 25%, ⇒ can determine Ebeam to 10−5 via g − 2 spin precession [7].

• Initial machine could produce light Higgs via s-channel [8]:

Higgs coupling to µ is (mµ/me)2 ≈ 40, 000× that to e.
Beam energy resolution at a muon collider < 10−5,

⇒ Measure Higgs width.

Add rings to 3 TeV later.

• Neutrino beams from µ decay about 104 hotter than present.

Possible initial scenario in a low-energy muon storage ring [9].

Study CP violation via CP conjugate initial states:

µ+ → e+νµνe
µ− → e−νµνe

.

VI. FUTURE FRONTIER FACILITIES

(A Personal Assessment)

• Hadron collider (LHC, SSC): ≈ $100k/m [magnets].
≈ 2 km per TeV of CM energy.
Ex: LHC has 14-TeV CM energy, 27 km ring, ≈ $3B.

• Linear e+e− collider (SLAC, NLC(?)): ≈ $200k/m [rf].
≈ 20 km per TeV of CM energy;
But a lepton collider needs only ≈ 1/10 the CM energy
to have equivalent physics reach to a hadron collider.
Ex: NLC, 1.5-TeV CM energy, 30 km long, ≈ $6B (?).

• Muon collider: ≈ $1B for source/cooler + $100k/m for rings

Well-deﬁned leptonic initial state.
mµ/me ≈ 200 ⇒ Little beam radiation.

⇒ Can use storage rings.
⇒ Smaller footprint.
Technology: closer to hadron colliders.
≈ 6 km of ring per TeV of CM energy.
Ex: 3-TeV muon collider, ≈ $3B (?), would have physics reach well beyond the LHC.

VII. MUON COLLIDER R&D PROGRAM

• Targetry and Capture at a Muon Collider Source [10,11].

Baseline scenario:

5

To achieve useful physics luminosity, a muon collider must produce about 1014 µ/sec.

– ⇒> 1015 proton/sec onto a high-Z target ⇔ 4 MW beam power.
– Capture pions of P⊥ <∼ 200 MeV/c in a 20-T solenoid magnet.
– Transfer the pions into a 1.25-T-solenoid decay channel.
– Compress π/µ bunch energy with rf cavities and deliver to muon cooling channel.

Proposed R&D facility:

• Ionization Cooling for a High Luminosity Muon Collider [12,13].

Test basic cooling components:

– Alternating solenoid lattice, RF cavities, LH2 absorber.
– Lithium lens (for ﬁnal cooling).
– Dispersion + wedge absorbers to exchange longitudinal and transverse phase space.

Track individual muons; simulate a bunch in software.

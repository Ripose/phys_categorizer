Abstract

In an effort to locate the cause(s) of high electric-
ﬁeld breakdown in x-band accelerating structures, we have
cleanly-autopsied (no debris added by post-operation struc-
ture disassembly) an RF-processed structure. Macroscopic
localization provided operationally by RF reﬂected wave
analysis and acoustic sensor pickup was used to connect
breakdowns to autopsied crater damage areas. Surpris-
ingly, the microscopic analyses showed breakdown craters
in areas of low electric ﬁeld. High currents induced by the
magnetic ﬁeld on sharp corners of the input coupler appears
responsible for the extreme breakdown damage observed.

INTRODUCTION

The Next Linear Collider (NLC) accelerating structures,
running at 11.424 GHz, are expected to hold a steady op-
erational surface gradient of 73 MV/m, without breakdown
arcing. A development program for the required structure
has been in progress at SLAC for several years. Possi-
ble RF structure candidates, Travelling Wave (TW) and
Standing Wave (SW) are tested in a specially dedicated
linac at SLAC, the Next Linear Collider Test Accelerator
(NLCTA). So far, mixed results have been obtained during
high electric ﬁeld-processing of structures, cf Fig. 1. Part of
the success in reaching the required gradient has been the
great improvement in cleaning and handling the structure
prior to RF processing. Results of the breakdown pattern
analysis via RF or acoustic sensors Fig.2, have led to the
necessity to cut open the structure. In this paper we will
present some of the results of the analysis of the autopsy of
the 53 cm long T53Vg3R TW structure.

2 RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS AND

DISCUSSION

During RF breakdown few kA/A of electrons/ions are
emitted inside a cell. The kinetic energy of electrons can
be up to 100 keV and ions up to few keV [1] [2]. Among
the interactions of those particles with the surface, few of
them might directly cause damage to the surface such as
surface heating and sputtering.

The breakdown pattern localization Fig.2 reveals that
most of the breakdown are occurring in the input coupler
(IC) of the TW. In Fig.3 we can see that the input coupler
is divided into two parts the waveguide section, left side
of the picture and the cell side in the center. The feature
separating the waveguide side and the cell side is denomi-
nated ”horns”. The gap between the top and bottom horn is
∼ 9mm.

GHz TW structures

Fig.4, 5 and 6 reveal a very interesting pattern of dam-
age. The craters on the ﬂoor of the IC, Fig.4, are mainly lo-
cated along the imaginary circles connecting the two faces
of the horns. Closing up to the horns and focusing on the

details, one can observe droplets of copper [3]. Craters ap-
pears on all the sides of the horns, with a density higher
in the face side than the waveguide or cavity side. Looking
more closely of the edges of the four horns has revealed that
the edge on the waveguide side, Fig.5, shows little damage.
In the contrary the edge on the cell side shows a chaos of
features, Fig. 6, with sharp and melted objects. The dimen-
sion bar in the right picture of Fig.6 is ∼ 10µm.

be invoked to explain the damages. However, the horns
lies in a very low electric ﬁeld area, and the vacuum is of
the order of 3.10−9 Torr. It is then not possible to explain
how such a low gas density and kinetic energy might start
a breakdown leading to the so seen damages. It is also not
possible to explain the very localization on the edge of the
cavity side of the horns Fig.6. During processing, the RF
pulse went from 50 ns to 400 ns carrying up to 100 MW of
power. Part of this energy is dumped in the Cu in form of
heat or directly or by the induced current due to the high
magnetic ﬁeld 0.7 MA/m at 400 ns pulse length [5]. Along
the edge (76 µm radius) this RF pulse heating leads to an
increase of temperature up to 130 ◦C. It is clear that this
temperature do not cause the observed damage. However,
it might induce thermal fatigue in the Cu, inducing forma-
tions of cracks, as observed in [6], and leading in roughen-
ing of the edge. As the surface becomes rougher, the local
resistivity of the Cu increases leading to a higher tempera-
ture maybe up to the melting point (1083 ◦C). At this tem-
perature, the vapor pressure of the Cu is ∼ 3.10−4 Torr [7].
This gas can now be ionized by the electrons coming form
the surface and back bombard the horns. As a result, raising
up the temperature and sputtering the surface. We might, in
addition, explain the droplet of Cu seen at the surface of the
ﬂoor. The patterns of craters on the ﬂoor, Fig.4, seems to
follow the high magnetic ﬁeld line. As we move toward the
center the density of craters diminish and increase again as
the electric ﬁeld start to be consequent Fig 7.

SEM (secondary electron microscopy) Fig. 7 shows the
damage on the upstream side and the downstream side of
the iris, respectif to the displacement of the NLCTA elec-
tron beam. On both sides etch pits can be seen as well
as craters. However, the density of craters is much higher
in the upstream side. Many craters are also located in the
grain boundary. A particle search in and out of the craters
shows MnS located in and out of them. Most of this inclu-
sions are located in the grain boundary. The analysis of the
contents of the craters shows mainly pure Cu. The black
spots on the upstream side is carbon. An Auger analysis
of the surface, not including those spots, shows heavy con-
tamination by carbon of this iris [3]. Carbon contamination
due to electron bombardement is a well known problem,
[8]. There is no such contamination in iris 28 further down
the structure [3].

As we move toward the output coupler (OC), the activity
on the irises decreases, endoscope (boroscope) monitoring.
Fig.8 shows the sparse activity on the 28th iris of the struc-
ture. As we looked for particles/inclusions on the surface
and at the grain boundary, we did not ﬁnd MnS. However,
some other sulfur compound were found [3], as the atypical
one shown in Fig.8.

IC

The observation of the damages on the horns is coher-
ent with the acoustic sensors analysis. Also pictures taken
during breakdown show clearly after averaging over 100
of breakdowns 4 spots in the approximative location of the
horns [4]. At ﬁrst Ion bombardement and sputtering might

The cells used to make the structure are bonded and then
brazed in a stainless steel (SS) H2 furnace at ∼ 1020 ◦C.
The Sulfur (S) composition is 0.03 weight % in stainless
steel. Other material like Mn, Cr, Ni are also used in
the making of SS. The solubility of sulfur in copper is

3 CONCLUSION

Following our autopsy many studies and simulation led
to the decision of rounding the edge to 3mm instead of
76 µm radius in order to avoid the thermal fatigue rough-
ening mechanism. It is believed that the new design of the
IC and OC implementing this rounding will cure our break-
down problem in those couplers. Also, machining a 3mm
edge radius should leave the surface extremely smooth. We
have shown on an identical input coupler of T53Vg3R,
Fig.9, that the 4 edges of the cavity side of the horns present
a roughness after machining. Following the etching and
thermal processing, that sees the structure, do not removed
this roughness. In a contrary, the edge on the waveguide
side of the horns are well ﬁnished.

very high at this temperature and signiﬁcant at a few hun-
dred ◦C. Hence, a signiﬁcant amount of S can get into the
copper. After its fabrication, the structure is vacuum baked
in a SS pot at 650◦C for few days, in order to desorb the
H2. Metals might be present in the atmosphere of the H2
furnaces and bakeout pot at this given temperature, with
vapor pressures of 10−5 Torr for Mn, 10−11 Torr for Cr,
10−1 Torr for Ca and below 10−11 Torr for Ni [7]. At
300◦C and above the S concentrates at the grain bound-
aries of the Cu. The S also start migrating to the surface
at low temperature 75◦C [9]. The Model for sulfur com-
pound formation is that the sulfur getters the metal vapor
out of the furnace atmosphere to form crystals/inclusions
at/near the grain boundaries. A particle search on the IC
reveals that ∼80% of the particles are Mn-S. On the very
next iris the proportion falls to ∼50%. The search in the
28th cell shows no Mn-S but S-compounds are present at
∼50%. Finally the search on the last cell in front of the
OC shows Mn-S and other S-compounds. Finally in all the
cases, other particles are compounds based on C, Al and Si
not excluding the presence of Mn or S or other elements.
This model might explain the sulfur compound formation,
but the understanding of the distribution along the structure
of those elements is under investigation.

chining (left) and after 60” etch and thermal processing

In order to conﬁrm the sharp corner problem two other
structures will be cut open. The T53Vg3RA has also
reached the desired 73 MV/m but the IC were responsi-
ble of more than 75% of the breakdown Fig.2. It is then
important to compare the two structures. Finally the wake-
ﬁeld damping slots in a cell, of an NLC type RF-structure,
DDS3 cf Fig.1, will be cut open and analyse. Those damp-
ing slots might have sharp and not de-burred corners lead-
ing to the understanding of DDS3 poor performance.

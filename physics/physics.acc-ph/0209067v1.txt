SLAC E-158 is an experiment designed to make the ﬁrst measurement of parity
violation in Møller scattering. E-158 will measure the right-left cross-section asym-
metry, AM øller

unpolarized electrons in a liquid hydrogen target. E-158 plans to measure the ex-

pected Standard Model asymmetry of
To make this measurement, the polarized electron source requires for operation an
intense circularly polarized laser beam and the ability to quickly switch between
right- and left-helicity polarization states with minimal right-left helicity-correlated
asymmetries in the resulting beam parameters (intensity, position, angle, spot size,
and energy), beamALR’s. This laser beam is produced by a unique SLAC-designed
ﬂashlamp-pumped Ti:Sapphire laser and is propagated through a carefully designed
set of polarization optics. We analyze the transport of nearly circularly polarized
light through the optical system and identify several mechanisms that generate
beamALR’s. We show that the dominant eﬀects depend linearly on particular polar-
ization phase shifts in the optical system. We present the laser system design and a
discussion of the suppression and control of beamALR’s. We also present results on
beam performance from engineering and physics runs for E-158.

1 Introduction

The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) has a distinguished history
of providing polarized electron beams for use in high energy physics exper-
iments, including important tests of the Standard Model of particle physics
and detailed studies of the spin structure of nucleons [1,2,3]. SLAC’s polar-
ized electron source is based on photoemission from a strained GaAs cathode
pumped by an intense, circularly polarized laser beam [4,5]. Two laser sys-
tems exist to pump the cathode: a Nd:YLF-pumped Ti:Sapphire laser (the
“YLF:Ti”) that generates short (2-ns) pulses of electrons for SLAC’s Positron
Electron Project (PEP) rings, and a ﬂashlamp-pumped Ti:Sapphire laser (the
“Flash:Ti”) used to generate 270-ns pulses for use in ﬁxed target experiments
at SLAC’s “End Station A” such as E-158, described brieﬂy below.

E-158 will make the ﬁrst measurement of parity violation in Møller scattering
by measuring the asymmetry in the cross section for elastic scattering of lon-

electron target:

where σR (σL) is the cross section for incident right- (left-) helicity electrons
[6,7]. The experiment will make a stringent test of the Standard Model of
particle physics and will also be sensitive to new physics beyond the Standard
Model [8]. The asymmetry will be measured to an accuracy of better than 10−8,
with the expected Standard Model asymmetry being approximately 10−7.

One critical challenge for E-158 is the suppression of helicity-correlated asym-
metries in the parameters of the electron beam when it is incident on the liquid
hydrogen target. Helicity-correlated asymmetries in the electron beam must
be held to very small levels to prevent them from contributing false asymme-
tries to the measurement at a signiﬁcant level. For instance, because typical
ﬁxed-target scattering cross sections are proportional to sin−4 θ and the de-
tector accepts electrons with scattering angles of 4.5
7.2 mrad, the scattered
ﬂux reaching the detector is strongly dependent on the position and angle of
the beam at the target. If, for example, over the length of the experiment the
average beam position on target for right- and left-helicity pulses is diﬀerent,
a false asymmetry will be measured that is proportional to the magnitude of
that diﬀerence. The Møller physics asymmetry in equation 1 can be expressed
in terms of measured detector and beam quantities. Consider ﬁrst a single pair
of pulses corresponding to right- and left-helicity beam incident on the E-158
target. For the case of small right-left diﬀerences (and neglecting background
contributions), the asymmetry for a single pair AP

where the angled brackets denote averaging over all pairs. Achieving these
limits will keep contributions to the systematic error on AM øller
at the level
of 1 ppb or less from each beamALR and keep the cumulative systematic error
contribution from all beamALR’s at the level of 3 ppb, a level comfortably
below the projected statistical error of 8 ppb. The derivation of these limits is
discussed in more detail in [6,9]. A major focus of the work presented in this
paper is the implementation of a number of methods for controlling beamALR’s
at a level that will allow achieving the requirements of equations 3.

In this paper we describe the Flash:Ti laser and the accompanying optics
system for the polarized electron source. The Flash:Ti system was originally
designed and commissioned in 1993 [4,10] and has seen extensive upgrades
in preparation for E-158. Table 1 summarizes the parameters of the Flash:Ti
laser beam for E-158. Likewise, the polarization and transport optics have also
seen signiﬁcant upgrades. The focus of these upgrades has been to improve the
suppression and control of beamALR’s. An overview of the polarized source laser
and optics systems as they are conﬁgured for E-158 is illustrated in Figure 1.
The laser and optics systems are housed in an environmentally controlled
room outside of the accelerator tunnel. The “Flash:Ti Bench” holds the laser
cavity and pulse-shaping optics. The “Diagnostics Bench” has photodiodes for
monitoring the laser’s intensity and temporal proﬁle and a monochromator for
measuring its wavelength. The “Helicity Control Bench” houses the optics for
controlling the polarization state of the beam and for suppressing beamALR’s. A
20-m Transport Pipe transports the beam into the accelerator tunnel, where it
crosses the “Cathode Diagnostics Bench” and is directed onto the cathode of
the polarized gun. The “Cathode Diagnostics Bench” holds optics for setting
the position of the beam spot on the cathode and an auxiliary diagnostic line.
The photoelectrons emitted by the cathode are bent through 38◦ and enter
the accelerator.

The heart of the polarized electron source is its photocathode. A new gradient-

running. This cathode, which is more fully described in [11], was developed in
a R&D project for the Next Linear Collider (NLC) project [12]. NLC requires

cathode), providing additional ﬂexibility in optimizing the optics system. In
order to provide an electron beam polarization as high as
80 %, a strain is
applied to the active layer of the cathode to break the degeneracy of the P3/2
energy levels as illustrated in Figure 2. However, the amount of strain varies
in direction with respect to the crystalline lattice. This variation induces a
“QE anisotropy” in the cathode, whereby the quantum eﬃciency (QE) of the
cathode becomes dependent on the orientation of the linear polarization of
incident laser light, with a typical analyzing power of 5
15 % [13]. The QE
anisotropy is a dominant ingredient contributing to beamALR’s and its eﬀects
are discussed in section 4.

The relationship between the helicity of the laser beam and the helicity of
the resulting polarized electron beam can be determined by considering the
bandgap diagram for GaAsP, shown in Figure 2. The laser light pumps elec-
trons from the P3/2 valence band into the S1/2 conduction band. Right-helicity
laser light excites electrons into the mJ =
1/2 state in the conduction band.
Because we operate the cathode in reﬂection mode (the emitted electrons move
in the direction opposite of the incoming laser light), the extracted electrons
are also right-helicity. Similarly, left-helicity laser light excites electrons into
the mJ = +1/2 state, and in reﬂection yields left-helicity electrons. In this
paper we deﬁne the handedness of the photon and electron beams according
to their helicity [14] as shown in Figure 3. ¶

−

The operating wavelength and required bandwidth of the Flash:Ti are deter-
mined by the photoemission properties of the cathode. Figure 4 shows, as a
function of wavelength, the cathode QE and the polarization of the photoemit-
ted electrons for the cathode used during E-158 2002 Physics Run I. As shown
in Table 1, we have chosen an operating wavelength of 805 nm in order to sit
at the polarization peak, and the Flash:Ti’s 0.7 nm FWHM bandwidth is nar-
row enough to ensure that all of the laser power is used to generate electrons

¶ This convention results in right- (left-) helicity photons corresponding to left-
(right-) circular polarization photons in the commonly used optics convention given
in [15].

at the peak polarization.

A particular focus of this paper is on the parts of the optical system that are
responsible for producing a circularly polarized laser beam and for suppress-
ing and controlling beamALR’s. As is discussed in section 4, a high degree of
circular polarization is critical for minimizing beamALR’s. We use a linear po-
larizer and a pair of Pockels cells on the Helicity Control Bench to gain control
over the laser beam polarization and to switch between helicity states on a
pulse-by-pulse basis. To achieve further suppression of beamALR’s, a number of

9

features are built into the optical system. These features include

i) optimization of the beam spot size and waist location at the polarization

Pockels cells;

ii) imaging of the polarization Pockels cells onto the photocathode;

iii) active feedbacks to null AI, DX(Y ), and DX′(Y ′);

iv) an insertable half-wave plate to reverse the laser helicity; and

v) the ability to toggle between two beam expanders which provide a mag-
niﬁcation of equal magnitude and opposite sign to reverse certain contri-
butions to DX(Y ) and DX′(Y ′).

This paper includes performance results for the laser and optics system from
three runs: T-437, a test-beam run in November 2000 which commissioned the
polarized source for E-158; an E-158 engineering run in January-May 2001;
and E-158 Physics Run I in April-May 2002. Table 2 summarizes changes in
key parameters of the laser beam between runs. The wavelength was changed
prior to 2002 Physics Run I to accomodate the new cathode. In addition, a
few results are presented from the Gun Test Laboratory, a test facility which
reproduces the ﬁrst few meters of the beam line.

Sections 2 and 3 of this paper discuss the design and implementation of the
Flash:Ti laser system and the accompanying optics system, progressing in se-
quence from the laser cavity to the photocathode. Section 4 discusses how
beamALR’s can arise from interactions between imperfections in the laser circu-
lar polarization and the cathode’s QE anisotropy. Section 5 discusses how the
laser polarization and transport optical systems are conﬁgured and optimized
to suppress beamALR’s and presents results from T-437. Finally, section 6 sum-
marizes many eﬀects which can generate beamALR’s and notes their relevance
to the SLAC source and E-158.

2 The Flash : Ti Laser System

This section discusses the design and operation of the Flash:Ti laser cavity, the
Flash:Ti cooling ﬂow system, the Flash:Ti modulator, the pulse shaping and
intensity control optics, and the laser beam diagnostics. The Flash:Ti laser
was largely designed and built at SLAC and is unique for its low jitter, long
pulse length, and high repetition rate capability. Performance results from the
recent E-158 engineering and physics runs are presented.

2.1 Flash:Ti Laser Cavity

The Flash:Ti pump chamber was designed at SLAC and constructed for us by
Big Sky Laser Technologies. ∗ A schematic of the laser cavity is depicted in
Figure 5. The rod-shaped Ti:Sapphire crystal is pumped by two ﬂashlamps,
each of which is associated with an elliptically shaped reﬂector. The origi-
nal commercial silver coatings of the reﬂectors and pump chamber end plates
have been replaced by rhodium. This change substantially increased their me-
chanical and chemical surface durability and eliminated the need to purge the
pump chamber with nitrogen during ﬂashlamp changes or other maintenance
work. The pump chamber parts can be exposed to air while they are handled
without the risk of corrosion. Two cylindrical ﬂashlamps † are used for this
system. The ﬂashlamp tubes have the following speciﬁcations: ID 4.8 mm, OD
5.98 mm, 7.6-inch arc length, Ce-doped quartz walls, and 450 Torr Xe ﬁlling.
The output of the ﬂashlamps is focused on the center of a 4-mm diameter
0.1%-doped Ti:Sapphire laser rod ‡ of 6.4-inch length. The rod, ﬂashlamps,
and pump chamber are cooled by a closed loop of ultra-pure water. The rod
ﬂow tube § surrounds the laser rod and its material acts as a UV ﬁlter to
prevent excessive solarization of the Ti:Sapphire material.

We achieve maximum laser cavity output power while maintaining low pulse-
to-pulse jitter by using a one-meter-long cavity formed by an 85 %-reﬂectivity
planar output coupler and a 99.9 %-reﬂectivity end mirror with a 2-m concave
curvature. Both mirrors have narrow-band dielectric coatings centered at the
operating wavelength (800 nm or 850 nm). A single quartz quarter-wave plate
1.3 mm thickness acts as both a Brewster plate and a birefringent tuner.

Pumping the Ti:Sapphire rod with ﬂashlamps leads to a strong thermal lens-
ing eﬀect [17]. To investigate the power of the thermal lens for our system, the
beam spot has been analyzed at relevant locations along the beam path under
typical running conditions. A set of measurements is shown in Figure 6. The

2.1.2 Flash:Ti Cooling Flow System

The cooling water ﬂow system is a closed loop and can be reﬁlled from on-
site low-conductivity water. Figure 7 shows a schematic of the water ﬂow
system. The system is designed to ensure a constant temperature of 76° F and
nearly inert water conditions. The main loop is chilled by a heat exchanger
and operates at a ﬂow rate of 2.5 GPM. Ultra-pure water quality ( > 15 MΩ)
is established by a 1-GPM polishing loop which contains a 0.2 µm particle
ﬁlter, a deionization ﬁlter, an organic ﬁlter, and an oxygen ﬁlter. A nitrogen
bubbler signiﬁcantly reduces the partial pressure of oxygen in the reservoir,
minimizing the amount of oxygen dissolved in the water. This was of particular
importance when the silver-coated reﬂectors were in use. The cooling water
constantly ﬂows through a 10-µm particle ﬁlter and a heat exchanger. Either a
3-ton or a 5-ton chiller can be used to provide cooling for the heat exchanger.
Interlocks are connected to water ﬂow, resistivity, and temperature sensors
mounted near the laser head. The interlocks shut oﬀ the laser power supply if
the sensor values move out of tolerance. For ﬂashlamp changes the laser head
can be drained and purged by a separate N2 supply.

2.1.3 Flash:Ti Modulator

The modulator (Figure 8) was designed and built by SLAC personnel and pro-
vides the high voltage pulse needed to ﬁre the ﬂashlamps. A 1.2 µF capacitor
charges from a 10 kV, 8 kJ/s power supply. ¶ Upon ignition of a thyratron, the
capacitor discharges through the two ﬂashlamps in series. This produces an
over-damped electrical pulse whose characteristics are set by the capacitance
of the capacitor and the stray inductance and resistance of the circuit compo-
nents. The pulse has a peak current of 1 kA and a duration of 22 µs. Between
pulses, a current through the ﬂashlamps is maintained by a “simmer” power
supply. k The simmer current reduces the high voltage needed for conduction
in the lamps and thereby extends their lifetime.

2.2 Intensity Control and Pulse Shaping

Immediately following the laser cavity on the Flash:Ti bench in Figure 5 are
optics dedicated to controlling the laser pulse’s energy, length, and temporal
proﬁle. Located between a pair of crossed polarizers, the “SLICE” Pockels cell

is used to control the laser pulse’s energy and pulse length. The “start” trigger
for the SLICE Pockels cell is set at the beginning of the low-jitter section of
the laser pulse (see Figure 12b). The duration of the sliced pulse is set by
its “stop” trigger. Typical sliced pulse lengths are 50
370 ns. The SLICE
Pockels cell is driven by a commercial high voltage pulser. ∗∗ The amplitude
of the high voltage pulse controls the intensity of the laser pulse. We use the
SLICE amplitude as the control device of a feedback system to stabilize the
intensity of the electron beam. This feedback provides compensation for the
slow decrease in cathode QE during its 3-day cesiation cycle as well as the
slow degradation of the ﬂashlamps’ eﬃciency during their lifetime. The half-
wave plate located upstream of the SLICE Pockels cell provides a means of
limiting the maximum sliced laser power to a level that is safe for accelerator
operation.

−

We shape the laser pulse’s temporal proﬁle using a Pockels cell–polarizer pair
(TOPS, TOp-hat Pulse Shaper, shown schematically in Figure 9) installed
downstream of the SLICE Pockels cell. This shaping is used to compensate
for beam loading and to achieve a small energy spread on the electron beam as
described below in section 5.3. TOPS is a SLAC-built pulse-shaping Pockels
cell system driven by a Stanford Research Systems (SRS) DS345 30 MHz syn-
thesized function generator. The SRS DS345 synthesized function generator
has been modiﬁed internally. It uses the SLAC 119-MHz source as an oscilla-
tor. Power for the Pockels cell is supplied by a SLAC-built DC power supply.
Control power for the TOPS system is supplied by the TOPS controller unit.

gram (SCP) through its GPIB interface. Remote control is achieved via an
EPICS (Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System) user interface.
The function generator allows one to generate an arbitrary waveform in 25-ns
steps. Using TOPS to compensate for beam loading and minimize each pulse’s
energy spread is discussed further in section 5.3.

2.3 Diagnostics

The laser beam is folded at multiple locations using broadband NIR-coated
(near-infrared) high-reﬂectivity mirrors. We use leakage light through these
mirrors or a sampled beam for diagnostic purposes. We routinely monitor laser
intensity, jitter, wavelength and spot size. The locations of the diagnostics are
shown in Figure 5. One photodiode installed upstream of the pulse-shaping
optics monitors the Flash:Ti laser output (Longpulse PD). A holographic beam
sampler †† downstream of the pulse-shaping optics supplies two one-percent
samples of the laser beam. One sample is used to monitor the intensity of
the sliced pulse (SLICE PD). The second sample is focused onto a scanning
monochromator for wavelength measurements or can be used to image the
beam spot onto a CCD camera.

2.4 Laser Performance

We summarize below the performance of the upgraded Flash:Ti laser system
during recent running. We brieﬂy review the laser’s performance during T-437
and the 2001 engineering run, and then focus on its performance during 2002
Physics Run I. The performance of the laser system for the earlier runs is more
fully described in [18]. The operating parameters of the laser system for 2002
Physics Run I are summarized above in Table 1.

2.4.1 Flash:Ti Performance During T-437 and the E-158 Engineering Run

T-437 and the E-158 2001 engineering run preceded the Flash:Ti cavity opti-
mization and thermal lensing studies. In addition, the cathode used for those
runs required a wavelength of 852 nm for maximum electron polarization, caus-
ing the laser to operate fairly far from the gain maximum for Ti:Sapphire. We
20 mJ in a 15-µs laser pulse with the laser cavity
achieved a laser power of
tuned to this wavelength. The SLICE Pockels cell described in section 2.2 was
set to slice a 130-ns pulse (370 ns for T-437) out of the area of highest stability,
resulting in a pulse of 1.5 % rms intensity jitter (1.0 % rms for T-437). The
pulse energy was

175 µJ for these conditions during the engineering run.

2.4.2 Flash:Ti Performance During E-158 2002 Physics Run I

A number of modiﬁcations improved the performance of the laser system for
E-158 2002 Physics Run I. First, the new photocathode requires a laser wave-
length of 805 nm for peak electron polarization. At 805 nm the laser operates
closer to the gain maximum of the Ti:Sapphire laser crystal, yielding a sig-
niﬁcant enhancement of laser performance. Furthermore, the consideration of
thermal lensing described in section 2.1.1 and appropriate end mirror selec-
tion were essential for improved performance. We also began to study the
dependence of energy jitter on the laser power supply high voltage and the
current of the switching thyratron. These were then optimized to minimize the
laser’s energy jitter. As the ﬂashlamps and thyratron age they require small
adjustments of the thyratron reservoir voltage.

Slow drifts in laser power and stability caused by humidity and temperature
variations are minimized by appropriate air conditioning and humidity control.
The temperature and humidity in the laser room are stable at 23.0
0.1 °C and
35
1 %, respectively. Figures 10 and 11 show the stability of the temperature
and humidity in the Laser Room which houses the polarized source laser and
optics systems.

3 Helicity Control Bench and Transport Optics to Cathode

In this section we describe the optics that follow the laser and pulse-shaping
systems. These optics circularly polarize the laser beam in a manner that
permits selecting the helicity in a pseudorandom sequence on a pulse-by-pulse
basis. The circularly polarized light is then transported to the cathode and care
is taken to minimize distortions in the laser polarization. As mentioned below
(and discussed in detail in section 4), small distortions generate signiﬁcant
amounts of linear polarization and ultimately contribute to helicity-correlated
asymmetries. The optics are conﬁgured to passively minimize and actively null
beamALR’s.

3.1 Circular Polarization

The polarization optics, shown in Figure 17, are designed to generate highly
circularly polarized light of either helicity while minimizing beamALR’s. The

Cleanup Polarizer also functions to combine the YLF:Ti beam used to generate
electrons for the PEP rings † with the Flash:Ti beam so that they share a
common path through the remaining transport optics. The CP cell acts as a
quarter-wave plate with its fast axis at 45° from the horizontal. The sign of
its retardation can be chosen on a pulse-by-pulse basis, generating circularly
polarized light of either helicity. Its quarter-wave voltage is approximately
2.7 kV. Adjusting its voltage from the quarter-wave setting allows the CP cell
to compensate for linear polarization along the horizontal and vertical axes
that arises from either residual birefringence in the Pockels cell or phase shifts
in the optics between the Pockels cells and the photocathode. The PS cell,
with a vertical fast axis, is pulsed at low voltages (. 150 V) and is used to

3.1.1 Polarization Analysis

To understand the function of the CP and PS cells, it is useful to develop
expressions for the polarization of the laser beam in terms of the phase shifts
induced by the CP and PS cells. The electric ﬁeld of a 100 % polarized laser
beam can be written as

for characterizing the polarization of the beam utilizes the Stokes parameters.

RH and LH represent intensities projected onto a decomposition into right-

that we refer to the circular polarization in terms of its helicity for consistency
with the particle physics deﬁnition, and SH
is deﬁned such that it is +1 for
3
right-helicity circular polarization. Two parameters, S1 and S2, are required to
completely describe the linear polarization state of the beam. We see from the
last line of equations 6 that the linear and circular polarization components
are constrained to add in quadrature to a value of one. One implication is
that for a reasonably well circularly polarized beam, a small phase shift may
have a negligible eﬀect on the magnitude of the circular polarization while
simultaneously inducing a large linear polarization. For instance, a perfectly
circularly polarized beam at 805 nm which acquires a 2-nm phase shift passing
through a thin low-stress window will have a circular polarization of 99.988 %
and a linear polarization of 1.6 %.

The SLAC polarized source optical system includes elements such as the CP
and PS Pockels cells, a half-wave plate, and additional optical elements that
may each possess a small amount of birefringence. These components can be
well approximated as diﬀerent cases of a unitary Jones matrix for a rotated

As we indicated earlier, δCP is set to values close to

δP S. Utilizing the Cleanup Polarizer and CP and PS cells in this conﬁgura-
tion allows us to generate a laser beam of arbitrary elliptical polarization. A
convenient feature of this conﬁguration is that any residual linear polarization
can be decomposed into components that are separately adjustable by the CP
cell (S1) and the PS cell (S2).

3.1.2 Pockels Cell Alignment

It is important to be able to properly align the Pockels cells with respect
to the laser beam and to choose the portion of the crystal through which
the beam passes. To this end, we choose mounts for the Pockels cells that
are adjustable in pitch, yaw, and roll and allow translation along both axes
perpendicular to the beam. The Pockels cells are initially aligned for pitch
and yaw between crossed polarizers (the Cleanup Polarizer and an auxiliary
analyzer), ﬁrst adding the CP cell and recovering extinction, and then adding
the PS cell. Care is taken to be sure that the Pockels cell orientations are not
at secondary minima. The orientation of the Pockels cell fast and slow axes can
2 kV)
be determined by then pulsing them one at a time at a high voltage (
and adjusting the roll angle until extinction is recovered. In this conﬁguration,
either the fast or slow axis is now parallel to the upstream polarizer. The CP
cell is then rotated by 45°; its orientation is veriﬁed and set more precisely
later. The PS cell is left in this orientation.

At this point, the analyzer is removed and the Helicity Filter ‡ (HF) is used
to check the alignment and set the initial Pockels cell voltages. The HF con-
sists of a linear polarizer and a quarter-wave plate ﬁxed in orientation so that
it transmits right-helicity light and extinguishes left-helicity light. The nom-
inal quarter-wave voltages for each helicity are set by sweeping the CP cell
through the range
3900 V) in 11 steps, measuring the transmitted
light intensity, and ﬁtting a parabola to the results. Similarly, the nominal PS
voltages are determined by setting the CP quarter-wave voltage for each state
1500 V to + 1500 V in 11 steps, measuring
and sweeping the PS cell from
the transmitted light intensity, and again ﬁtting a parabola to the results. To
be satisﬁed with the alignment, we require that the extinction ratio between
transmitted and extinguished states be greater than 1000:1, that the sum of
the CP right- and left-helicity voltages be below 100 V, and that the diﬀer-
ence of the PS right- and left-helicity voltages be below 100 V. The diﬀerence
between the PS voltages is very sensitive to the alignment of the CP cell roll
angle and provides the best means of verifying that it is properly oriented. If

the PS cell voltages are greater than 100 V apart, the CP and PS cells are

An additional check of the voltages for right-helicity light, which are measured
above in transmission, can be made by using the insertable half-wave plate
mounted just upstream of the HF. This allows us to measure the voltages
for right-helicity light in extinction. Finally, we check the quality of the laser
beam polarization on the photocathode. We do this by letting the beam strike
the cathode and measuring the intensity asymmetry as the Pockels cell volt-
ages are varied from their nominal values. This procedure is described in more
detail in section 5.1.1 and allows us to adjust the CP and PS cell voltages
to compensate for residual birefringence in the optics between them and the
photocathode. A ﬁnal cross check on the laser beam polarization is a scan
of the Pockels cell voltages while measuring the electron beam polarization.
The only available electron beam polarimeter is the Møller polarimeter in End
Station A, so this check can only be conducted while E-158 is running. Typical
operating voltages for the CP and PS cells are given in Table 3, section 5.1.1.

3.1.3 Insertable Half-Wave Plates

We have two insertable zeroth-order half-wave plates in the optics system
following the polarization optics that can be used to introduce a slow reversal
of the laser helicity. This ﬂips the deﬁnition of helicity relative to what the data
acquisition system (DAQ) is expecting, thus reversing the sign of the physics
asymmetry. Such a reversal is very useful for suppressing certain classes of
systematic errors, and is discussed in section 5.5. One half-wave plate is located
on the Helicity Control Bench (Figure 17), where it is also useful for setting
the initial Pockels cell voltages with the HF. The second half-wave plate is
located on the Cathode Diagnostics Bench (Figure 19) and is the last optical
element before the vacuum window at the entrance to the polarized electron
gun. Either half-wave plate can be used to eﬀect the slow reversal, but we
choose to use the one on the Cathode Diagnostics Bench for reasons discussed
in section 4.4.

3.2 Helicity Control and Data Acquisition

The beam helicity is controlled by the “Polarization MONitor” (PMON) sys-
tem. PMON’s interaction with the optics hardware and the DAQs is shown in
schematic form in Figure 18. PMON is a set of SLAC-built custom electron-
ics that generates a pseudorandom sequence of polarization states (“polbits”)

26

using a 33-bit shift register algorithm as described in [21]. At 120 Hz, this
sequence repeats approximately once every two years. Because the dominant
noise in the electronic environment surrounding the accelerator is at 60 Hz, we
choose to treat the 120-Hz triggering as two separate 60-Hz time slots. We do
this by imposing a quadruplet structure on the helicity sequence in which two
consecutive pulses have randomly chosen helicities and the subsequent two
pulses are chosen to be their complements. For example, a possible sequence
could be “LRRL LLRR.” In the data analysis, asymmetries are calculated for
each pair of events, where pairs are formed between the ﬁrst and third mem-
bers of the quadruplet, and between the second and fourth members. In this
way we calculate pairwise asymmetries between pulses that are at the same
phase with respect to the 60-Hz noise. The pseudorandom sequence also pro-
vides a means of error checking in the oﬄine analysis. Observing the helicity
state of 33 consecutive pairs allows one to predict the state of future pairs.
Comparing the predicted state with the actual state transmitted to the DAQ
can be used to look for data acquisition errors. PMON determines the pulse
sequence, sets the appropriate voltages for all helicity-correlated devices (the
CP, PS, and IA Pockels cells and the piezomirror), and distributes the helicity
information and pulse identiﬁcation number to the DAQs.

PMON interacts with two DAQs in order to control the helicity-correlated
devices. For testing and commissioning the source optics, we use PMON with
the SLC Control Program (SCP). For test beams and physics running, PMON
works with the E-158 DAQ to control the optics. Switching between the two
DAQ systems is done by swapping a pair of cables at the PMON Interface
Module that are used for the setting and readback of voltages for the helicity-
correlated devices. SCP is also used to control which algorithm the PMON
Controller uses to generate the helicity sequence. Five sequences are avail-
able: the pseudorandom sequence described above, an alternating left/right
sequence, all left-helicity pulses, all right-helicity pulses, and all no-helicity
pulses (for which none of the helicity-correlated devices are operated). The
“Insertable Optics Controller” is a SLAC-built module which receives control
signals from SCP and sends the appropriate voltage levels to the insertable
optical elements. It also sends status information to the E-158 I/O Register.

Three techniques are implemented in PMON to prevent the transmission of
helicity information to the DAQs from introducing false asymmetries via elec-
tronic cross talk. First, PMON delays the transmission of helicity information
by one pulse. This delay destroys the correlation between the actual beam
helicity and the helicity information received by the DAQ. Second, PMON
converts the helicity information from a digital signal to an RF signal before
transmitting it to the experiment over “SLCnet,” a dedicated copper transmis-
sion line. A PMON Receiver module in the E-158 DAQ decodes the RF signal.
Third, additional copies of the polarization information that are available as
analog voltage levels during commissioning of the SCP and E-158 DAQs are

3.3 Laser Transport Optics and Cathode Diagnostics Bench

We describe next the optical system between the polarization optics and the
cathode. These optics image the CP cell onto the cathode while preserving
the circular polarization of the beam. An “Asymmetry Inverter” consisting
of two beam expanders with magniﬁcations of equal magnitude and opposite
sign (see Figure 17) can be toggled between two positions to provide some
cancellation for helicity correlations in the laser beam position and angle. We
used the software packages PARAXIA and ZEMAX to model gaussian beam
propagation through the transport optics and to design the transport optics.

3.3.1 Imaging

We image the CP cell onto the cathode in order to minimize the contribution
of any helicity-correlated steering arising from the CP cell. The imaging op-
tics consist of the 5-m lens in the Transport Pipe and the telescope on the
Cathode Diagnostics Bench (both shown in Figure 19). The location of the
image point is most sensitive to the setting of the telescope on the Cathode
Diagnostics Bench. The downstream lens of that telescope is adjustable in

and thereby dictating the location of the object point on the Helicity Control
Bench. We replaced the previous 3′

bench to allow some freedom of movement to locate the CP cell at the object
point. The new cathode described in the introduction gives us additional ﬂex-
ibility to choose the laser spot size on the cathode. Full illumination of the
20-mm-diameter cathode is no longer needed to achieve the required electron
1 cm for the 1/e2 diameter,
beam current. By reducing the spot size to
we place the object point within a few centimeters of the CP cell and also
improve the electron beam properties and transmission. The imaging optics
are designed to bring the laser beam through a waist between the telescope
and the cathode to avoid clipping in the 14-mm-diameter pipe that leads from
the Cathode Diagnostics Bench to the cathode. Because the laser beam gets
as large as 1 inch in diameter while being transported from the Laser Room
to the cathode, we use 2-inch lenses and mirrors for the imaging optics and
the Mirror Box to avoid clipping.

∼

The remotely insertable 50 % mirror at the exit of the Cathode Laser Diagnos-
tics Bench redirects the beam into a diagnostic line that has the same length
as the distance between the mirror and the cathode. The Cathode Target pro-
vides an image of the beam as it appears on the cathode and is an extremely
useful diagnostic, in particular for understanding the imaging of the beam and
for measuring the position dependence of the cathode’s QE. We determine the
location of the object point by placing a wire mesh screen in the beam near
the CP cell and moving it along the beam axis while studying the quality of
the image on the Cathode Target. We observe that the object point is within
a few centimeters of the CP cell. This provides a signiﬁcant reduction of the
eﬀective lever arm from the
25 m actual distance between the CP cell and
the cathode. The object point is observed to be the same for both states of
the Asymmetry Inverter.

3.3.3 Preserving Circular Polarization

The transported laser beam must retain a high degree of circular polarization.
We employ several strategies to achieve this. First, we minimize the number of
optical elements in the transport system by placing the laser beam diagnostics
in the auxiliary diagnostic line accessed by the insertable 50 % mirror. Second,
the four mirrors in the Mirror Box are arranged in two helicity-compensating
pairs, for which the bounces within each pair interchange ‘s’ and ‘p’ polariza-
tions. Thus, the diﬀerence in phase shifts and losses between the ‘s’ and ‘p’
polarizations for a given mirror are cancelled between the members of each
pair. Care was taken to make certain that the four mirrors all came from the

30

same coating run. § Finally, the Transport Pipe, which has historically been
held under vacuum as part of a Class-IV laser containment system, is being
used at atmospheric pressure for E-158 in order to minimize stress-induced
birefringence in its end windows. Alternate arrangements have been made to
ensure the integrity of the Transport Pipe for laser safety purposes.

3.4 Helicity-Correlated Feedbacks

Three active feedback loops are used to further suppress beamALR’s. One feed-
back loop (the “IA loop”) balances AI between the two helicity states. This is
accomplished by using the “Intensity Asymmetry” (IA) Pockels cell, located
upstream of the Cleanup Polarizer (see Figure 17). When pulsed diﬀerently
on right- and left-helicity pulses by a few tens of volts, the IA cell intro-
duces a helicity-correlated phase shift into the beam. The Cleanup Polarizer
transforms this phase shift diﬀerence into an intensity asymmetry on the laser
beam which compensates for the measured intensity asymmetry on the elec-
tron beam.

A second feedback loop (the “POS loop”) compensates for DX(Y ) and DX′(Y ′).
This is accomplished by the “piezomirror,” a standard 1-inch diameter mir-
ror attached to a Physik Instrumente model S-311.10 ¶ piezoelectric mount
(see Figure 17). This unit has three piezoelectric stacks that can be pulsed
individually up to 100 V. The independent operation of the three stacks gives
the freedom to translate the face of the mount up to 6 µm, or to tilt in an
arbitrary direction by up to 600 µrad. The piezomirror changes the angle of
the laser beam through the remainder of the optical system and can produce
50 µm (depending on
helicity-correlated displacements on the cathode of 20
the eﬀective lever arm between the piezomirror and the cathode), comparable
to the beam position jitter.

−

The third feedback loop (the “Phase Feedback”) provides a mechanism for
keeping the corrections induced by the IA loop small. It looks at the correction
induced by the IA loop averaged over a speciﬁed length of time and adjusts the
CP and PS cell voltages in such a way as to drive the IA loop correction to zero.
Essentially, the Phase Feedback compensates for drifts in the polarization state
of the laser beam that can give rise to an intensity asymmetry as described in
section 4.

The IA and POS loops utilize measurements from low-energy (1-GeV) elec-

tron beam diagnostics and act on the laser beam. Additional independent
diagnostics at both low and high (45 GeV) energy are used to monitor the
performance of the feedback loops and to measure beamALR’s at the E-158
target. We choose to generate the measurements for the feedback loops from
beam diagnostics at low energy in order to minimize coupling between the
various beamALR’s as a result of beam loading, residual dispersion, and wake-
ﬁeld eﬀects in the accelerator. The IA, POS, and Phase Feedback loops are
discussed in more detail in section 5.4.

4 Primary Sources of Helicity-Correlated Electron Beam Asym-

metries (beamALR’s)

−

The primary mechanism for generating a helicity-correlated asymmetry in the
intensity of the polarized electron beam, AI, is a coupling between helicity-
correlated changes in the orientation of residual linear polarization in the laser
beam and the cathode’s QE anisotropy. The linear polarization components
are a consequence of residual birefringence in the CP and PS cells and in
the optics between them and the cathode. This residual birefringence is sig-
niﬁcant: a typical low-birefringence window produces a phase shift per unit
thickness of 5 nm/cm. The strained GaAs cathode’s QE anisotropy provides a
large analyzing power for incident linear polarization, typically on the order of
15 % [13]. Uncorrected, a 5-nm phase shift can produce a helicity-correlated
5
variation in electron beam intensity at the level of 0.4 %, four orders of mag-
nitude larger than the experimental requirement. Similar polarization-related
eﬀects have sometimes been referred to [22] as PITA (Polarization-Induced
Transport Asymmetry) eﬀects and are often a dominant source of beamALR’s.
We derive an expression for AI for the case of the SLAC polarized electron
source optics, identify the relevant phases, and examine the implications for
controlling beamALR’s. We also ﬁnd that if the residual linear polarization of
the laser beam varies spatially, it can give rise to helicity-correlated position
and spot size diﬀerences. We note that while in the analysis below the only an-
alyzing power is a transport element in the optics system, the QE anisotropy
of the cathode behaves formally in the same way.

4.1 Derivation of the Polarization-Induced Transport Asymmetry

We can understand the origin of AI by considering a system (as described
in section 3.1) comprised of horizontally polarized light incident in turn on
the CP cell, the PS cell, and an asymmetric transport element. The ﬁnal
electric vector can be computed by multiplying the initial electric vector by

where JCP and JP S are given by equations 9 and 10 and JAT is an asymmetric
transport element which provides an analyzing power that is sensitive to the
orientation of linear polarization and does not introduce any depolarization.
Assuming the asymmetric transport element has transmission coeﬃcients Tx′
and Ty′ along some axes x′ and y′, we have

we see that the ﬁnal intensity of the beam is modulated by the phase shifts in-
duced by the CP and PS cells and the orientation of the asymmetric transport
element. We allow the CP and PS cells to induce retardations that provide a
fully general description of elliptically polarized light. We choose a particular
way to write them, however, so that the asymmetry has a simple form:

to perfectly circularly polarized light. We give the phases from the CP cell
a subscript “1” because Stokes parameter S1 is particularly sensitive to δCP .
Similarly, the phases induced by the PS cell carry a subscript “2” to emphasize
that Stokes parameter S2 is particularly sensitive to δP S. These sensitivities
are evident from the Stokes vector for the light following the PS cell in this

the other phases in equations 19 are set to zero. The arrows indicate the direction
of increasing time.

The reason for the names “symmetric” and “antisymmetric” is apparent from
Figure 20. A nonzero α phase shift (Figures 20a and 20b) turns circular po-
larization into elliptical polarization for which both helicities have the same
major and minor axes, i.e., the phase shift aﬀects the two polarization ellipses
symmetrically. A nonzero ∆ phase (Figures 20c and 20d), however, results in
elliptical polarization for which the two polarization ellipses have their major
and minor axes interchanged, an antisymmetric behavior.

The parameterization given in equations 19 gives a completely general descrip-
tion of the elliptical polarization reaching the cathode, where additional phase
shifts from components downstream of the CP and PS cells (providing they
impose unitary transformations on the polarization vector) can be included as
additional contributions to the α’s and ∆’s. Two special cases, the addition of
a slightly birefringent optic and the addition of an imperfect half-wave plate,
are discussed below in section 4.4; in those cases we separate out from the α’s
and ∆’s the contributions made by those optics in order to make explicit the
helicity-correlated eﬀects they induce.

Before calculating AI, we can argue that to ﬁrst order, only the antisymmetric
phase shifts ∆1 and ∆2 contribute to it. From equations 20, we see that SR

an asymmetric transport element with greater transmission along the vertical
axis than the horizontal, it is clear that the ellipses with symmetric phase shifts
are transmitted with equal intensity while the ellipses with antisymmetric
phase shifts are not.

Finally, we insert equations 19 into equation 18 and calculate AI. We use the
small-angle approximation and only keep terms that are ﬁrst order in phase
shifts and ﬁrst order in ǫ:

We allow that residual birefringence in the Pockels cells or the optics down-
stream of them may introduce oﬀsets by including the terms ∆0

that birefringence in downstream optics can only contribute antisymmetric
(∆-type) phase shifts. The formalism above assumes that the asymmetric
transport element is a component of the optical system. Examples would in-
clude any optical element that is not exactly normal to the beam. However,
equation 21 remains valid if the optical analyzing power is replaced by a cath-
ode with a QE anisotropy. The strained GaAs cathodes in use at SLAC provide
the dominant analyzing power in the system.

4.2 PITA Slopes

Note that AI depends linearly on the two antisymmetric phase shifts, ∆1 and
∆2. This allows us to deﬁne two “PITA slopes” m1 and m2 that are easily
measurable and characterize the sensitivity to residual linear polarization of a
given optical system and analyzer. The PITA slopes play a central role in our
techniques for minimizing beamALR’s. In practice, it is convenient to express

The phases ∆1 and ∆2 can be converted to voltages using equation 4. By
adjusting the voltages on the CP and PS cells in an antisymmetric fashion,
one can adjust the size of either the Stokes 1 or the Stokes 2 components,
and thus the size of AI. For instance, suppose one optimizes the laser circular

4.3 Spatial Variation of Birefringence

1 and ∆0

1 and ∆2 −

We have seen that AI is directly proportional to ∆1 −
2. We
have assumed, however, that if an optical element introduced a phase shift
∆, the phase shift is the same regardless of the point on the face of the ele-
ment through which the light passed. But what if the phase shift varied across
the face of the optical element? If we allow that the residual birefringences
∆0
2 may have a spatial dependence to them, then it follows that AI
will also have a spatial dependence. A spatially varying AI opens the possi-
bility of higher-order helicity correlations. For instance, a laser beam with a
∆0
1 varying linearly in x as in Figure 22a produces an electron beam with a
linearly varying AI. This variation has the eﬀect of shifting the centroids of
the right- and left-helicity electron beams in opposite directions as illustrated
in Figure 22b and yields an electron beam with a helicity-correlated horizontal
position diﬀerence. Such eﬀects are certainly present in the Pockels cells and
are likely present at some level in the downstream optics as well.

A spatially varying ∆ retardation is one of the dominant sources of higher-
order (position, spot size, and spot shape) helicity correlations in the spatial
proﬁle of the electron beam. A convenient way to characterize the spatially
varying phase shift is via “moments” similar to the moments of a statistical
distribution. Each moment can then be connected to a particular beamALR.
The zeroth moment (the average phase shift across the beam) gives rise to
AI. The ﬁrst moment is related to the gradient in phase shift across the beam
and gives rise to DX(Y ). The second moment is related to the curvature of the
phase shift across the beam and gives rise to spot size diﬀerences. Similarly,
higher-order moments can be related to higher-order helicity correlations in
the beam proﬁle. Note from equation 22 that the sensitivity of the electron
beam to spatial variations in ∆0
2 scales with m1 and m2, respectively.
We discuss characterizing and minimizing such eﬀects further in section 5.1.2.

4.4 Vacuum Window Birefringence and Half-Wave Plate Cancellation

1 and ∆0

As we consider how to suppress beamALR’s arising from residual linear polariza-
tion, it is useful to separate out of the oﬀset terms ∆0
2 the contributions
that arise from the insertable half-wave plate used for slow helicity reversal
and the vacuum window at the entrance to the polarized electron gun. The
vacuum window possesses a signiﬁcant stress-induced birefringence and is un-
avoidably downstream of the half-wave plate and the Asymmetry Inverter,
making it diﬃcult to arrange cancellations of helicity-correlated asymmetries
1 and ∆0
that arise from it. For the remainder of the paper, we redeﬁne ∆0
2
to exclude the residual birefringence associated with the vacuum window and
the insertable half-wave plate, each of which we consider separately. We model
the vacuum window as a retardation plate with a small retardation β and an
arbitrary orientation angle ρ measured from the horizontal axis. The vacuum
window can then be represented as

Next we consider the insertion of the half-wave plate used for slow helicity
reversal, as discussed in sections 3.1.3 and 5.5.1. Here we focus on how the half-
wave plate manipulates residual linear polarization. We want to understand to
what degree a cancellation of position and spot size diﬀerences can be achieved
if they arise from spatial variations in the residual birefringence of particular
optical elements.

We assume that downstream of the PS cell we have an imperfect half-wave
plate followed by the vacuum window. The half-wave plate is allowed an arbi-
trary orientation ψ and a deviation γ from perfect half-wave retardation and
can be represented as

We compare this result to equation 25, bearing in mind that the coeﬃcients
multiplying each term (∆0
2, β, and γ) may have a spatial dependence that
could give rise to helicity-correlated position or spot size diﬀerences. Compar-
ing the ﬁrst two terms of each equation, which include the contributions of all
optics upstream of the half-wave plate, we see that they have acquired both a
relative minus sign and a dependence on the orientation of the half-wave plate.
We gain some freedom to choose the PITA slopes by appropriately orienting
the half-wave plate, but their values cannot be chosen independently. The
optimal cancellation of position and spot size diﬀerences would be gained by
inserting the half-wave plate in an orientation such that the PITA slopes are
unchanged, but the relative minus sign prevents that. However, if one can ar-
range for one PITA slope to be much larger in magnitude than the other, then
one can orient the half-wave plate to preserve the large PITA slope and per-
haps still achieve a reasonable cancellation of eﬀects arising from the upstream
optics. Unfortunately, this procedure requires control over the orientation of
the cathode’s analyzing power and such control is impractical.

Comparing the third terms of equations 25 and 28, we see that the vacuum
window contribution ﬂips sign with insertion of the half-wave plate. The sign
ﬂip prevents any cancellation of beamALR’s arising from optics downstream of
the half-wave plate, motivating us to place the half-wave plate as far down-
stream as possible.

The half-wave plate itself introduces a fourth term that is proportional to the
deviation of its retardation from π. To the extent that this term is signiﬁcant,
it poses an obvious problem for arranging a cancellation.

In summary, higher-order eﬀects are not preserved but change in a com-
plex way with insertion of the half-wave plate, resulting in a decrease in the
amount of cancellation. One further strategy that can be pursued is to mea-
sure beamALR’s for a number of half-wave plate orientations and empirically
determine which provides the best cancellation, but again this is not feasible
because the half-wave plate is not readily accessible. None of these compli-
cations pose a problem for minimizing AI, however: one simply measures the
new PITA slopes and adjusts ∆1 and ∆2 accordingly as is discussed more
later.

39

A second option for using a half-wave plate insertion to generate a slow helicity
reversal is to insert the half-wave plate between the Clean-up Polarizer and
the CP cell. By inserting the half-wave plate with its fast axis at 45° to the
horizontal, the initial linear polarization is rotated from horizontal to vertical
and the sense of the circular polarization generated by the CP cell is reversed.
The half-wave plate matrix for this case is given by equation 26 with ψ = 45°.

The upstream half-wave plate inverts the sign of each of the ﬁrst three terms
relative to eqn. 25. Using the half-wave plate in this conﬁguration is guaran-
teed to ﬂip the sign of any beamALR’s arising from spatial variation in birefrin-
gence; no cancellation is gained. We choose to use a half-wave plate placed
as far downstream as possible, immediately before the vacuum window on
the polarized gun, to gain the best cancellation possible, accepting that the
cancellation is imperfect.

5 Techniques for Minimizing beamALR

′s

We have adopted a number of strategies for designing the polarized source op-
tics system that are speciﬁcally aimed at minimizing beamALR’s. Passive strate-
gies include careful selection and setup of the CP and PS Pockels cells, imaging
of the CP cell onto the cathode, and shaping of the laser pulse’s temporal pro-
ﬁle to compensate for beam loading eﬀects. Active strategies include feedbacks
on AI and DX(Y ). Finally, introducing slow reversals of helicity correlations
with respect to the physics asymmetry generates cancellations and provides
a tool for studying systematic errors. Each of these strategies is described in
detail in the following subsections. We ﬁnish this section by presenting results
on the control of helicity-correlated asymmetries from T-437.

We are motivated to minimize beamALR’s via passive means as well as pos-
sible before using active feedbacks for two reasons. First, an active feedback
on a particular beamALR can generate helicity correlations in other beamALR’s
as a side eﬀect. Second, minimizing the beamALR’s we can control also likely
suppresses higher-order beamALR’s that we cannot directly control and for
which we have no active feedbacks. Similarly, this concern motivates the use
of “Phase Feedback” on the intensity asymmetry. Another strategy is to mon-

40

itor the higher-order moments of the electron beam’s spatial intensity proﬁle.
We are able to measure the beam’s spatial intensity proﬁle with a wire array
located just upstream of the E-158 target. These measurements allow us to
determine whether higher-order beamALR’s are present in the electron beam at
a signiﬁcant level.

5.1 Optimizing the CP and PS cells and the Laser Beam Polarization

We optimize the CP and PS cells by selecting them for uniformity of retar-
dation, orienting them relative to the beam carefully, setting their voltages
to maximize the circular polarization after the PS cell, and then adjusting
their voltages to minimize AI on the electron beam. The basic setup of the
polarization optics is discussed in section 3.1. Here we discuss those aspects
of the setup that are speciﬁcally related to suppressing beamALR’s.

5.1.1 Measuring the PITA Slopes and Correcting the Intensity Asymmetry

±

∼ ±

200 V (or

As was discussed in section 4.2, the PITA slopes characterize the sensitivity of
a particular optical system and cathode to the presence of small linear polar-
ization components and provide a key tool for minimizing AI. We determine
the PITA slope for the CP cell by ﬁrst measuring AI on the electron beam as
we vary ∆1 in ﬁve steps over the range
7 °, see equation 4)
and then ﬁtting a line to the resulting data. Similarly varying ∆2 yields the
PS cell PITA slope. The PITA slopes for T-437 are shown in Figure 21. We
can then deﬁne a “voltage space” representing a two-dimensional plane whose
x- and y-axes correspond to ∆1 and ∆2. Considering again equation 22, we see
that if we set the left-hand-side equal to zero, we deﬁne a line in this voltage
space along which the intensity asymmetry is zero, the “AI = 0 line.” As was
discussed in section 3, the voltages determined for the CP and PS cells using
the Helicity Filter need to be adjusted to compensate for phase shifts in the
optics downstream of them. This adjustment is equivalent to moving onto the
AI = 0 line. The AI = 0 line can be clearly seen in Figure 23. These data were
taken in the Gun Test Laboratory (on a diﬀerent cathode than those used for
the E-158 runs), which reproduces the ﬁrst several meters of the accelerator.
The point of large AI at the origin is the intensity asymmetry measured using
the nominal voltages determined via the Helicity Filter. We have to choose a
particular point on the line as optimal, and our strategy is to move toward
the AI = 0 line in a perpendicular fashion in order to change the laser beam
polarization by the minimum amount necessary to zero AI. The required ∆1

where AI is the measured intensity asymmetry that needs to be corrected.

We verify that this is a good choice of voltages by performing a similar scan
of ∆1 and ∆2 and showing that the voltages which maximize the electron
beam’s polarization agree with those found by using equations 31. This check
requires that the electron beam can be brought into End Station A in order
to use the Møller polarimeter located there. Figure 24 shows an example of
such a study. In Figure 24, the electron beam polarization is measured as a
function of ∆2, with ∆1 = 0. The peak polarization is found to be at an oﬀset
voltage of ∆2 = (
32) V, which is consistent with the values found by
using equation 31 to move onto the AI = 0 line. Table 3 summarizes typical
operating voltages for the CP and PS cells as measured with the HF scans and
after either using the PITA slopes to null AI or using the Møller polarimeter
to measure the peak electron beam polarization.

It is also interesting to note that the position diﬀerences are typically sensitive
to the choice of location along the AI = 0 line, as demonstrated in Figure 25.
These data were taken in the Gun Test Laboratory concurrent with the data
shown in Figure 23. Here, DX and DY are plotted as a function of ∆1, with
∆2 correspondingly set to null AI. The physical mechanism underlying this
behavior is not understood, although the sensitivity of position diﬀerences to
the choice of ∆1 and ∆2 has been observed to depend on the ratio of m1 to
m2 and on the choice of cathode. One possibility is that this observation is
caused by variations in the magnitude or orientation of the analyzing power

across the face of the cathode. In most cases, the dependence of DX(Y ) on the
choice of ∆1 and ∆2 was observed to be too small to provide a useful tool
for minimizing DX(Y ). This fact also suggests that the mechanism which gives
rise to this dependence is not one of the dominant mechanisms for generating
beamALR’s in the SLAC system.

5.1.2 Selection and Setup of Pockels Cells

The presence of spatially varying residual birefringence in the Pockels cells
makes the selection of the Pockels cells and the setup of the beam through
them important for suppressing helicity-correlated position and spot size dif-
ferences. We studied the residual birefringence in six QX2035 and one QX1020
Pockels cells and found that the peak-to-peak change in the residual birefrin-
1.5
gence across them varied between
7 nm, depending on the Pockels
cell. A typical study of a Pockels cell, made in the Gun Test Laboratory, is
shown in Figure 26. The measurements are made by placing a linear polar-
izer immediately after the Pockels cell in order to maximize the analyzing

gain maximum sensitivity to variations in its residual birefringence. The beam
is detected by a linear array photodiode. † Twelve elements in the central por-
tion of the array are instrumented, alternating instrumented and uninstru-
mented elements, providing a total detection area of 6.45 mm
6.44 mm
with 50 % coverage. The resulting signals are analyzed to determine the
helicity-correlated intensity asymmetry and, along a single axis, the helicity-
correlated position and spot size diﬀerences. The position diﬀerence is obtained
by computing the weighted mean of the position for each helicity according to
i(I R(L)
, where xi is the position of the ith element

pulses. The spot size diﬀerence is similarly calculated as the diﬀerence between
the rms’s for right- and left-helicity pulses. The detector can be rotated by
90° to measure position and spot size diﬀerences along the other axis. The de-
tector is placed immediately after the polarizer in order to minimize the lever
arm over which helicity-correlated lensing or steering diﬀerences can operate.

asymmetry, horizontal position diﬀerence, and horizontal size diﬀerence on
the laser beam as a function of the horizontal position of the CP cell. Based
on the analysis given in section 4, we interpret the variation in the intensity
asymmetry as a spatial variation in the magnitude of the CP cell’s residual
birefringence. The peak-to-peak variation in the intensity asymmetry of 1.1 %
corresponds to a peak-to-peak variation in the phase shift of 1.5 nm, consis-
tent with the expected level of residual birefringence variation for this model of
Pockels cell. There is a clear though imperfect correlation between the slope
of the intensity asymmetry curve and the size of the position diﬀerence: at
a horizontal setting of 10, for instance, the intensity asymmetry reaches its
maximal positive slope and the position diﬀerence also reaches an extremum.
Likewise, the position diﬀerences cross through zero at two points, 12.5 and
16.7, where the slope of the intensity asymmetry curve is near zero. A similar
imperfect correlation can be identiﬁed between the curvature of the intensity
asymmetry curve and the size of the spot size diﬀerence. For example, the
spot size diﬀerence reaches extrema of opposite signs at horizontal settings of
11.5 and 17.5, points where the intensity asymmetry exhibits relatively large
degrees of curvature of opposite signs.

We chose the two QX2035 Pockels cells with the smallest gradients in birefrin-
gence and least curvature to use as the CP and PS cells. We placed them on
two-axis translation stages in order to be able to optimize in situ the points
on the crystals through which the laser beam passes. Because the gradients
across these two Pockels cells are signiﬁcantly smaller than those observed on
other cells and the cathode used during 2002 Physics Run I has an analyzing
power that is a factor of two smaller than the previous cathode, the sensitiv-
ity of beamALR’s to their translation is signiﬁcantly reduced. In addition, the
contributions to beamALR’s from these two Pockels cells are relatively small
when they are centered on the beam (similar to the Pockels cell scan shown
in Figure 26). We decided to run with them centered on the beam for 2002
Physics Run I.

We also observed that by minimizing the diameter of the laser beam at the
Pockels cells we could further reduce our sensitivity to gradients in the residual
birefringence. However, because the Pockels cells are naturally birefringent, ‡
it is important to keep the beam well collimated passing through them for two
reasons: to ensure that all rays receive an equal retardation and to minimize
the correlation between position and angle within the beam. We designed
the upstream optical transport system (consisting of the three lenses on the
Flash:Ti, Diagnostics, and Helicity Control benches, see Figures 5 and 17) to
bring the beam through a gentle focus at the CP and PS cells. Balancing the
conﬂicting requirements that the beam be both small and well collimated, we
found the optimum beam sigma to be approximately 1 mm at the CP and PS
cells.

5.2 Imaging and Transport Optics

As was discussed earlier in section 3.3.1, we image the CP cell onto the cathode
to minimize helicity-correlated lensing or steering diﬀerences that may arise
from its high-voltage operation. Studies of helicity correlations arising from the
helicity-ﬂipping Pockels cell were made in preparation for the Bates 12C exper-
iment [23]. They clearly demonstrated that the Pockels cell produced helicity-
correlated lensing or steering diﬀerences and that imaging could be used to

suppress these diﬀerences. While exhaustive studies of helicity-correlated lens-
ing and steering diﬀerences have not yet been carried out on the SLAC system,
we use a similar model of Pockels cell and have seen signiﬁcant evidence for the
presence of such eﬀects in a variety of measurements. Uncontrolled, we suspect
that they have the potential to contribute to beamALR’s at a level comparable to
or even greater than birefringence gradients. We estimate that by imaging the
CP cell to the cathode we have reduced the eﬀective lever arm from
25 m to
a few centimeters, thereby strongly suppressing any helicity-correlated lensing
or steering diﬀerences that may be present. We also optimized the transport
optics to preserve a high degree of circular polarization as described in sec-
tion 3.3.3.

5.3 Beam Loading Compensation

The primary mechanism for introducing a helicity-correlated energy asym-
metry, AE, into the electron beam is through “beam loading.” The electrons
early in a pulse absorb power from an accelerating cavity as it accelerates
them. Electrons later in the pulse therefore ﬁnd less power available to accel-
erate them. If the electron pulse’s temporal proﬁle were ﬂat, the later electrons
would be accelerated less, creating an energy spread along the length of the
pulse. In addition, a further time dependence to the power available for ac-
celeration is imposed by the time structure of the RF voltage applied to the
cavities. We compensate for this beam loading eﬀect and the curvature of the
applied RF voltage by shaping the laser pulse’s intensity proﬁle with TOPS as
described in section 2.2 and Figure 13. The optimal temporal proﬁle is sloped,
with its intensity decreasing with time. The average beam loading (over the
length of the pulse) is 5 %, and the energy spread is reduced to 0.1 % by
the pulse shaping and other accelerator tuning techniques [19]. Beam load-
ing introduces an anticorrelation between the intensity and the energy of the
beam: we would expect that the 0.5 % intensity jitter during 2002 Physics
Run I should drive an energy jitter of 0.025 %. The energy jitter was typically
measured to be 0.03 % during the run. To the extent that the jitter in the
beam energy is in fact driven by jitter in the beam intensity, AE tracks AI
and beneﬁts from the performance of the IA feedback loop described below.

5.4 Active Feedbacks on beamALR’s

Active feedbacks on AI and DX(Y ) provide additional suppression of these
helicity-correlated asymmetries beyond what is achieved by the polarization

optimization procedures and imaging. The implementations of the IA, POS,
and Phase Feedback loops are described in the following subsections. The
hardware for the feedback loops is described above in section 3.4. First, we
outline the general algorithm and discuss how the active nature of the feedback
can suppress the mean value of the quantity being fed back on faster than one
would expect from counting statistics. Performance results for the feedback
loops from T-437 are discussed in section 5.6.

5.4.1 Feedback Algorithm and 1/N Scaling

The feedback loops each require three ingredients: a control device capable of
being driven in a helicity-correlated fashion, the optical system and cathode
which generate beamALR’s, and a set of diagnostic devices on the electron beam
to measure beamALR’s. The measured beam asymmetry (or diﬀerence, in the
case of position) can be represented as a sum of the contributions from each
part of the loop,

Abeam = Actrl + Aopt + Astat,

(32)

where Actrl is the asymmetry induced by the control device, Aopt is the helicity-
correlated asymmetry caused by the optics and cathode, and Astat is the con-
tribution from statistical jitter in the measured electron beam parameter. The
asymmetry is averaged over a “minirun” of M pulse pairs (where each pair
consists of one pulse of each helicity) and then a correction is applied on the
following minirun according to the general algorithm

An

ctrl = 0,
ctrl = An−1

ctrl −

beam,

(33)

where “g” is the gain of the loop and “n” is the number of the minirun.

An active feedback loop can cause the central value to converge to zero faster
than one would naively expect based on a knowledge of the jitter in the mea-
surement and the available statistics. Consider an ideal feedback loop, in which
the control device has perfect resolution, a unity gain is chosen, Aopt is con-
stant, and the statistical jitter in the beam parameter contributes a noise
asymmetry Astat for each minirun. The noise asymmetry contribution has a
width σstat. Then allowing the feedback to run for N miniruns, the algorithm

48

outlined above generates the following behavior:

Averaging the N miniruns then yields

The active nature of the feedback arranges a cancellation of the contributions
to the asymmetry arising from statistical jitter for all miniruns except the last.
We see that the mean measured asymmetry scales as (Aopt+AN
stat)/N. We refer
to this as “1/N scaling,” in contrast with the normal statistical behavior in
the absence of feedback for which the mean measured asymmetry scales as
Aopt + σstat/√N .

5.4.2 Intensity Asymmetry Feedback

The IA loop is responsible for ensuring that AI converges to zero and that

A number of factors limit the 1/N scaling we can achieve with the IA loop. The
ultimate limiting factor is the ﬁnite resolution of the beam current monitors,
0.5 %
which in our case is typically 25 ppm/pair, negligible compared to the
intensity jitter. The more severe limitation on 1/N scaling for our system comes
from the fact that while we are running the feedback at 1 GeV, the important
measurement of AI for the experiment is the one made in front of the E-158
target, two miles downstream. Beam losses in the accelerator can add a new
source of intensity jitter at a potentially signiﬁcant level. We are currently
evaluating whether this source of jitter is small enough to allow adequate
scaling of AI and are considering using a current monitor at 45 GeV for the
feedback. In addition, matching the data set used in the oﬄine analysis to
that used by the feedback to generate 1/N scaling in the online analysis is a
solvable but nontrivial challenge. We should also note that to achieve full 1/N
scaling one must run with a unity gain.

5.4.3 Phase Feedback

As is discussed in section 4, the dominant source of AI is the interaction
between phase shifts in the optics and the cathode’s analyzing power. Phase
Feedback refers to a second layer of feedback on AI which averages over the
IA loop correction for a number of miniruns (typically 30) and then adjusts
the CP and PS cell voltages to null the IA loop correction. This procedure
provides compensation for drifts in the residual birefringence of the Pockels
cells and the optics downstream of them that can cause the IA loop correction
to wander at the 100-ppm level. We adjust the CP and PS voltages by an
amount proportional to the average asymmetry induced by the IA cell over
the last N miniruns, Aind, according to the prescription of equations 31 with
AI replaced by
Aind. In principle, the Phase Feedback can be used alone to
null AI, but using two layers of feedback provides ﬂexibility. The IA loop can
be run on a short time scale to take advantage of 1/N scaling, while the Phase
Feedback can be run on a longer time scale that is appropriate for keeping the
IA loop correction small. The IA loop alone typically applies a correction at
the 100-ppm level, which is three orders of magnitude larger than the physics
asymmetry. The Phase Feedback is capable of reducing the IA loop correction
to the few ppm level when averaged over several days.

5.4.4 Position Diﬀerence Feedback

−

E-158 requires that the helicity-correlated position diﬀerences DX(Y ) be below
10 nm averaged over several months of data taking. The position diﬀerences
are typically several microns at the cathode when no eﬀort is made to con-
trol them; with various optimizations (choice of Pockels cells, translation of
Pockels cells, choice of operating voltages, and imaging) we achieve DX(Y ) as
small as 0.5
1.0 µm. We also observe approximately an order of magnitude
reduction in DX(Y ) between the cathode and the E-158 target. This is due in
part to a drop in spot size from a 2.5-mm sigma at the cathode to 1 mm at
the target. The remainder comes from emittance growth due to synchrotron
radiation emission. The emittance growth causes the spot size to increase, and
the additional magnetic focusing required further suppresses the phase space
available for DX(Y ). The goal is to achieve 1-2 orders of magnitude of suppres-
sion of DX(Y ) from an active feedback system. The position jitter at the E-158
target is typically . 50 µm per pair so it should be possible to achieve a statis-
tical error on DX(Y ) of a few nm averaged over the entire run. The statistical
error bar will be small enough that additional suppression from 1/N scaling
is not necessary. We use the POS loop to suppress both DX(Y ) and DX′(Y ′)
simultaneously. We can use one feedback on the laser beam to suppress two
eﬀects on the electron beam because they are not linearly independent. There
should only be position diﬀerences at the cathode; angle diﬀerences at the
E-158 target arise because the cathode is not imaged onto it by the electron

y-tilts. We were free to choose the gain because we did not need 1/N scaling
of the position diﬀerences.

5.5 Slow Reversals and Cancellations of beamALR’s

It is useful to incorporate into the experiment certain “slow reversals” that
change the sign of an eﬀect with respect to its inﬂuence on the physics asym-
metry. Such slow reversals serve two purposes: they generate cancellations of
beamALR’s and they provide a means of verifying our understanding of the mea-
sured detector asymmetry. Having multiple slow reversals allows us to study
the quality of cancellation each reversal provides. If a single reversal yields the
same central value for the physics asymmetry in both of its states then it pro-
vides a convincing cross check that false detector asymmetries (such as those
arising from nonzero beamALR’s or electronic cross talk) are well understood.
However, if the two states disagree, it is diﬃcult to quantify how to make a

53

correction. One can only average the results and hope that the false asym-
metry contribution cancels out. Using multiple reversals provides a number
of complementary cross checks, each of which is sensitive to diﬀerent com-
binations of false asymmetries. Comparing the quality of agreement between
states for each slow reversal may provide a measure of the uncertainty in the
physics asymmetry.

LR

Two types of reversal can be identiﬁed: those that are designed to reverse the
sign of the physics asymmetry (AM øller
) without changing any false asymme-
tries in the experiment, and those that are designed to reverse the sign of
certain beamALR’s without changing the physics asymmetry. We have imple-
mented one reversal of each kind in the source optics system: the insertable
half-wave plate provides a slow reversal of the physics asymmetry and the
Asymmetry Inverter provides a slow reversal of position diﬀerences arising
from the polarization optics. These two reversals are discussed in more detail
below.

Additional slow reversals can be implemented on the electron beam as well. A
second means of physics reversal, running the electron beam at two energies,
takes advantage of the energy dependence of the rate of g-2 precession of the
beam polarization as it is brought around a bend and into End Station A.
We run at two energies that each result in longitudinal polarization in End
Station A but with a relative phase diﬀerence of 180°. For a given electron
helicity at the source, the two energies correspond to opposite helicities on
target. It would also be useful to implement a second Asymmetry Inverter in
the electron beam optics, but this has not yet been done.

The slow and passive nature of these reversals is in marked contrast to the
fast helicity reversal provided by the CP cell. The CP cell provides a pulse-
by-pulse helicity reversal, and, by virtue of its pseudorandom sequence, one
that is insensitive to noise at low frequencies and to drifts in the experimental
apparatus (such as gradual changes in the detector phototube gains). The
insertable half-wave plate and running at two energies both function as means
of “passively” reversing the deﬁnition of helicity in the experiment in the sense
that they do not involve electronic signals on a pulse-by-pulse basis, as the
pulsing of the CP and PS cells do. Certain classes of false asymmetries are
not sensitive to the presence of the half-wave plate or the choice of electron
beam energy. These classes of false asymmetries cancel upon averaging data
for the two states of each reversal. One prime example is electronic cross-talk
between the CP cell high voltage pulse and the data acquisition electronics.

54

5.5.1 Half-Wave Plate Reversal

The half-wave plate is expected to provide a good cancellation for many classes
of false asymmetries, including those arising from electronic cross talk and
helicity-correlated lensing or steering diﬀerences from the CP cell. However,
as is described in section 4.4, the behavior of beamALR’s arising from imperfec-
tions in the circular polarization of the laser beam depends on the orientation
of the half-wave plate in a complicated way, so it is not straightforward to
gain a cancellation of these eﬀects. We have two insertable half-wave plates,
one on the Helicity Control Bench (which is primarily used for initially de-
termining the operating voltages for the polarization Pockels cells) and one
on the Cathode Diagnostics Bench. For physics running we use the Cathode
Diagnostics Bench half-wave plate because it is downstream of all other optics
except the vacuum window on the electron gun. We toggle the state of the
half-wave plate once every 48 hours.

5.5.2 Asymmetry Inverter Reversal

Immediately downstream of the PS cell is the Asymmetry Inverter (AI), which
is described in section 3.3.2. Switching between its “+2.25I” and “
2.25I”
optics inverts both the position and angle of the outgoing optics rays. Averag-
ing over all optics rays in the beam, any helicity-correlated position and angle
diﬀerences resulting from the polarization optics should have opposite signs
for the two AI states. We can see this by considering the helicity-correlated
position and angle diﬀerences for the laser beam entering the AI, averaging
over all its optics rays:

5.6 Measurements of beamALR’s During T-437

Measurements of beamALR’s were made during T-437 and are reported fully
in [9]. T-437 was a one-week beam test in November 2000 which recommis-
sioned the polarized electron source and commissioned the polarization optics,
electron beam diagnostics, and SCP and E-158 DAQs that are used for con-
trolling beamALR’s. In particular, T-437 was an opportunity to commission the
IA and POS loops, measure AI and DX(Y ), and study the eﬀectiveness of the
half-wave plate and Asymmetry Inverter cancellations. Here we summarize
those results.

We commissioned the IA loop and measured AI during T-437. A pair of toroids
at the 1-GeV point in the accelerator measured the beam current and AI. The
measurement from one toroid controlled the feedback while the second toroid
provided an independent measurement that was used to evaluate the sys-
tematic error associated with the measurement and to determine the toroid
resolution. We used miniruns of 2000 pairs in length, yielding a statistical error
0.8 % intensity jitter at that
per minirun of
time. Figure 28a shows the performance of the IA loop during part of T-437.
The mean value of AI and an envelope representing the one-sigma statistical
error (assuming a zero systematic oﬀset) are plotted as a function of time in
units of the number of pulse pairs included in the average. For the entire T-437
test, we measured AI = 0.2
5.7 ppm, where the error bar is the statistical
error (i.e., the rms width of the intensity asymmetry distribution divided by
the square root of the number of pairs in the distribution). The mean value
of 0.2 ppm is consistent with the expected asymmetry of
0.33 ppm assum-
ing 1/N scaling. Further evidence for 1/N scaling can be seen in Figure 28a,
where the mean value of AI rapidly acquires a value signiﬁcantly less than the
statistical error and wanders around zero. T-437 also demonstrated agreement
between the two current monitors of 6
12 ppb, where the error is determined
by the toroid resolution.

5.6.2 Measurements of DX(Y )

We also commissioned the POS loop and measured DX(Y ) during T-437. For
that test, we used three beam position monitors (BPMs) spaced at 1-m inter-
vals and located at the 1-GeV point in the accelerator. The middle BPM was
the control device for the feedback loop. The position diﬀerences measured by
the upstream and downstream BPMs were used to predict the position diﬀer-
ence at the middle BPM and thereby provide an independent measurement

that was used to evaluate the systematic error associated with the measure-
ment and to determine the BPM resolution. We used a minirun length of
10, 000 pulses. T-437 demonstrated that the POS loop closes, as shown in
Figures 28b and 28c. T-437 set a limit at the 20-nm level on the ability of
the POS loop to make position diﬀerences small and was only limited by the
available statistics. The corrections induced by the POS loop are tabulated
in Table 5. The measurements at the middle (feedback) BPM were found to
agree with the predicted value determined by the upstream and downstream
BPMs to a level of 2 nm.

5.6.3 Half-Wave Plate Cancellation

We toggled the state of the half-wave plate on the Cathode Diagnostics Bench
every two hours during several shifts of T-437 and found that it provided some
cancellation of DX(Y ), as shown in Table 4. For this running period, the IA
loop was under control of the SCP DAQ and used a toroid in the injector
for its feedback device; the POS loop was not used. The cancellation yields
approximately a factor of three reduction in y and an order of magnitude in
x. However, the degree of cancellation is extremely sensitive to the details
of the source setup, so this past performance cannot be taken as a strong
indication of the quality of cancellation from the half-wave plate for future
running. A new cathode, realignment of the CP and PS cells, and adjustment
of the imaging optics all can aﬀect the ability of the half-wave plate toggling
procedure to cancel DX(Y ).

the reversal of the sign of the physics asymmetry. Reprinted from [9].

5.6.4 Asymmetry Inverter Cancellation

A test of the Asymmetry Inverter during T-437 yielded encouraging results.
Table 5 lists the corrections applied by the POS loop for runs in each state
of the Asymmetry Inverter, along with their average. For these runs, both the
IA and POS loops were used under the control of the E-158 DAQ. In the case
of the y position diﬀerences, for which the correction applied by the POS loop
was large, a signiﬁcant degree of cancellation is seen. It should be noted that
in both states the POS loop maintained the measured values of DX(Y ) at a
level that was consistent with zero.

5.7 Performance of Passive and Active Suppression Strategies

We ﬁnish this section by comparing the performance of the passive optimiza-
tion and the active feedbacks. The intensity asymmetry is initially 0.1
0.5 %
after setting the CP and PS cell voltages with the HF. Adjusting ∆1 and ∆2
manually to null it brings it to the 100-ppm level. The IA loop reduces AI by
more than 2 orders of magnitude to
1 ppm (for example, T-437 achieved
0.3 ppm in a short run and was statistics-limited). The Phase Feedback
AI ∼
can reduce the average IA loop correction to the few ppm level.

6 Summary of Potential Sources of beamALR

′s

In this section we review the mechanisms for generating beamALR’s which we
have identiﬁed as dominant for the SLAC source. We also mention several
potential mechanisms which are not dominant but are possibly present at
a smaller level. Table 6 provides a summary of the discussion given in the
following subsections.

The mechanisms that dominate for the SLAC source may not be the same
as those that dominate for other sources. Particular properties of the SLAC
source that may inﬂuence which mechanisms are important include the par-
ticular model of Pockels cell in use (Cleveland Crystals QX2035), the partic-
ular cathode used (strained GaAs for T-437 and the 2001 engineering run;
gradient-doped strained GaAsP for 2002 Physics Run I), the long physical
25 m), and the
distance between the polarization optics and the cathode (
large diameter of the laser spot on the cathode (1 cm 1/e2 diameter.).

6.1 Residual Linear Polarization Coupling to QE Anisotropy

The primary mechanism for generating AI is residual linear polarization inter-
acting with asymmetric transport elements, as is discussed in section 4. The
key optical elements that introduce residual linear polarization are the CP and
PS Pockels cells and the vacuum window, each of which possesses signiﬁcant
residual birefringence. Many optical components are candidates to be asym-
metric transport elements, and care must be taken in setting up the optical
transport system to minimize such eﬀects. The dominant analyzing power in
the system is provided by the cathode’s QE anisotropy. AI can be suppressed
either by reducing the amount of residual linear polarization incident on the
cathode or by reducing the cathode’s QE anisotropy. Neither the half-wave
plate nor the AI provide cancellations of this eﬀect.

6.2 Birefringence Gradients

As is discussed in sections 4.3 and 5.1.2, gradients in the residual birefringence
of the CP and PS cells and the vacuum window (and possibly other optics at

59

a lower level) produce a spatial variation in AI and are a dominant source of
helicity-correlated position and spot-size diﬀerences. We suppress the contri-
butions from the Pockels cells by carefully selecting and setting up the Pockels
cells and by minimizing the beam diameter at their location. The half-wave
plate provides an imperfect cancellation (see section 4.4) of both position and
spot size diﬀerences arising from these gradients for optics upstream of it and
no cancellation for eﬀects arising from the vacuum window. The Asymmetry
Inverter provides some cancellation of position diﬀerences from the Pockels
cells.

6.3 Lensing

Helicity-correlated lensing or steering generated by the CP cell (sections 3.3.1
and 5.2) is present in the SLAC system at a signiﬁcant level. While it is diﬃcult
to untangle the relative contributions of lensing and birefringence gradient
eﬀects, we believe that imaging has suppressed lensing suﬃciently that it is
comparable to or smaller than the birefringence gradient eﬀects. When we have
isolated eﬀects that can be interpreted as lensing in laser beam measurements,
we have observed that the eﬀects cancel with the half-wave plate insertion. In
addition, we expect that the Asymmetry Inverter also provides a cancellation
of position diﬀerences.

6.4 Beam Loading

As discussed in section 5.3, beam loading is the primary mechanism for in-
ducing an energy asymmetry. We compensate for beam loading by properly
shaping the laser pulse (section 2.2). If the dominant cause of energy jitter
is intensity jitter, then we should gain additional suppression of AE from the
IA loop. Neither the half-wave plate nor the Asymmetry Inverter provides a
cancellation of AE.

6.5 Collimation and Spot Size at CP Pockels Cell

A converging or diverging laser beam traversing a Pockels cell acquires a gra-
dient in its retardation that has an eﬀect similar to a birefringence gradient
as is discussed in section 5.1.2. Collimating the laser beam at the Pockels
cells both minimizes the beam’s angular spread and reduces the correlation
between position and angle, suppressing these eﬀects. Increasing the beam
diameter also reduces this eﬀect but increases the sensitivity to birefringence

60

gradient eﬀects. We compromise by placing a laser beam waist at the CP and
PS cells with a size of 1 mm rms.

6.6 Cathode Gradients

Since we have observed that spatial variations in ∆1 and ∆2 lead to signiﬁ-
cant helicity-correlated position and spot size diﬀerences, it is natural to ask
whether similar eﬀects can arise from spatial variations in the other param-
eters of equation 21, the analyzing power ǫ/T and the analyzer orientation
θ. We speculate that the physical mechanism underlying the observation that
position diﬀerences depend on choice of ∆1 and ∆2 along the AI = 0 line
(section 5.1.1) might be a manifestation of such variations. If this is the case,
then we can say that gradients in the cathode strain are a noticeable eﬀect
but clearly not the dominant eﬀect in the SLAC system. It is likely that sup-
pressing ∆1 and ∆2 also suppresses beamALR’s arising from these variations.
However, neither the half-wave plate nor the Asymmetry Inverter provides a
cancellation.

6.7 Electronic Cross Talk

Electronic cross talk between various necessary helicity-correlated signals and
the DAQ can cause a mismeasurement of beamALR’s and the detector asymme-
try. Cross talk can be caused by coupling between either the transmission of
the polarization state information or the high voltage pulse applied to the CP
cell (which acts as an antenna) and ground loops in the DAQ. The DAQ was
carefully designed to avoid ground loops and we take the steps described in
section 3.2 to eliminate the polarization state information as a problem. Any
residual eﬀects are sensitive to cancellation by the half-wave plate.

6.8 Etalon Eﬀects

Certain bench studies we conducted using an unwedged Pockels cell led us to
consider the possibility that a Pockels cell with parallel faces can behave as
a Fabry-Perot etalon. A careful analysis of such a system reveals that it is
capable of producing rather large intensity asymmetries (as large as 10−3 for
a Pockels cell without AR coatings) on the laser beam, provided that the line
width of the laser beam is small compared to the free spectral range of the
3 GHz). This, however, proves not to be the case for
Pockels cell etalon (
300 GHz.

7 Conclusion

We have described the laser and optics systems for SLAC’s polarized electron
source for the E-158 parity violation experiment. This experiment seeks to
measure a parity-violating right-left asymmetry with a statistical error of 8
parts per billion (ppb), and therefore requires systematic errors due to right-
left beam asymmetries at the ppb level. The laser is a stable, high-power,
high-repetition rate, low-maintenance ﬂashlamp-pumped Ti:Sapphire. Polar-
ized electrons of either helicity can be generated by ﬂipping the helicity of the
laser beam. The optics system has been extensively analyzed and optimized to
minimize beamALR’s. The techniques we employ to achieve this include careful

∗ The coupling between residual linear polarization in the laser beam and the cath-
ode QE anisotropy results in the dominant contribution to AI . It is also a dominant
source of position and spot size diﬀerences and of the energy asymmetry via spatial
gradients and beam loading (listed separately).

els cell onto the cathode, active feedbacks on the helicity-correlated intensity
asymmetry and position diﬀerences, half-wave plate reversals of the beam he-
licity, and an Asymmetry Inverter to reverse position and angle diﬀerences.

used for an additional E-158 physics run and for a variety of polarized beam
experiments thereafter.

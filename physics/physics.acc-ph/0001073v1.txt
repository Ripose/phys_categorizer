Formation of Patterns in Intense Hadron Beams. The

Amplitude Equation Approach ∗

Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94309

Stephan I. Tzenov

Abstract

We study the longitudinal motion of beam particles under the action of a single
resonator wave induced by the beam itself. Based on the method of multiple
scales we derive a system of coupled amplitude equations for the slowly varying
part of the longitudinal distribution function and for the resonator wave envelope,
corresponding to an arbitrary wave number. The equation governing the slow
evolution of the voltage envelope is shown to be of Ginzburg–Landau type.

1 Introduction

So far, extensive work has been performed on the linear stability analysis of collective motion
in particle accelerators [1]. Nonlinear theories [2]–[7] of wave interaction and formation of
patterns and coherent structures in intense beams are however less prevalent, in part, due
to the mathematical complexity of the subject, but also because of the commonly spread
opinion that highly nonlinear regime is associated with poor machine performance that is
best to be avoided.

Nevertheless, nonlinear wave interaction is a well observed phenomenon [2], [8] in present
machines, complete and self-consistent theory explaining the processes, leading to the forma-
tion of self-organized structures mentioned above is far from being established. The present
paper is aimed as an attempt in this direction.

The problem addressed here (perhaps, the simplest one) is the evolution of a beam in
longitudinal direction under the inﬂuence of a resonator voltage induced by the beam itself.
Linear theory is obviously unable to explain bunch (droplet) formation and bunch breakoﬀ
(especially in the highly damped regime), phenomena that have been observed by numerical
simulations [2], [3], [7], but it should be considered as the ﬁrst important step towards our
ﬁnal goal – nonlinear model of wave interaction developed in Section 3.

It is well-known that within the framework of linear stability analysis the solution of the
original problem is represented as a superposition of plane waves with constant amplitudes,
while the phases are determined by the spectrum of solutions to the dispersion equation.
Moreover, the wave amplitudes are completely arbitrary and independent of the spatial and
temporal variables. The eﬀect of nonlinearities is to cause variation in the amplitudes in
both space and time. We are interested in describing these variations, since they govern the
relatively slow process of formation of self-organized patterns and coherent structures.

The importance of the linear theory is embedded in the dispersion relation and the type
of solutions it possesses. If the dispersion relation has no imaginary parts (no dissipation of
energy occurs and no pumping from external energy sources is available) and its solutions,
that is the wave frequency as a function of the wave number are all real, then the correspond-
ing amplitude equations describing the evolution of the wave envelopes will be of nonlinear
Schr¨odinger type. Another possibility arises for conservative systems when some of the roots
of the dispersion equation appear in complex conjugate pairs. Then the amplitude equations
can be shown to be of the so called AB–type [10]. For open systems (like the system studied
here) the dispersion relation is in general a complex valued function of the wave frequency
and wave number and therefore its solutions will be complex.
It can be shown [10] that
the equation governing the slow evolution of the wave amplitudes in this case will be the
Ginzburg–Landau equation.

Based on the renormalization group approach we have recently derived a Ginzburg–
Landau equation for the amplitude of the resonator voltage in the case of a coasting beam
[5]. The derivation has been carried out under the assumption that the spatial evolution of
the system is much slower compared to the temporal one. This restriction has been removed
here, and the present paper may be considered as an extension of [5].

Using the method of multiple scales we derive a set of coupled amplitude equations for

2

the slowly varying part of the longitudinal distribution function and for the intensity of a
single resonator wave with an arbitrary wave number (and wave frequency, speciﬁed as a
solution to the linear dispersion equation). The equation governing the evolution of the
voltage envelope is shown to be of Ginzburg–Landau type.

It is well-known that the longitudinal dynamics of an individual beam particle is governed
by the set of equations [9]

is the proportionality constant between the frequency deviation of a non synchronous particle
with respect to the frequency ωs of the synchronous one, and the energy deviation ∆E =
E − Es. The quantity k0 also involves the phase slip coeﬃcient η = αM − γ−2
, where αM is
the momentum compaction factor [9]. The variables

φ = φs − hz1.

(2.3)

are the azimuthal displacement of the particle with respect to the synchronous one, and the
phase of the RF ﬁeld, respectively. Here VRF is the amplitude of the RF voltage and h is
the harmonic number. Apart from the RF ﬁeld we assume that beam motion is inﬂuenced
by a resonator voltage V1 due to a broad band impedance

To obtain the desired amplitude equation for nonlinear waves we use the method of multiple
scales [10], [11]. The key point of this approach is to introduce slow temporal as well as
spatial scales according to the relations:

where bVz implies diﬀerentiation with respect to ∂/∂z. Substituting them back into (3.3)

and (3.4) we obtain the corresponding perturbation equations order by order. It is worth
noting that without loss of generality we can miss out the spatial scale z2, because it can be
transformed away by a simple change of the reference frame. For the sake of saving space
we will omit the explicit substitution and subsequent calculations and state the ﬁnal result
order by order.

where bFn and bLn are the corresponding operators, calculated for Tn and zn.

In order to solve consistently the perturbation equations for each order we need a unique
equation for one of the unknowns; it is more convenient to have a sole equation for the
distribution functions fn alone. This will prove later to be very eﬃcient for the removal
of secular terms that appear in higher orders. By inspecting the above equations order by
order one can catch their general form:

∂f0
∂u

= αn

;

bFfn + λVn

bVVn = bLhfni + βn,

where αn and βn are known functions, determined from previous orders. Eliminating Vn we
obtain:

Let us now proceed with solving the perturbation equations. The analysis of the ﬁrst order
equations (linearized equations) is quite standard, and for the one-wave solution we readily
obtain:

V1 = E(zn; Tn)eiϕ + E ∗(zn; Tn)e−iϕ∗

with

(3.24)

(3.25)

where given the wave number k, the wave frequency Ω(k) is a solution to the dispersion
equation:

The dispersion function eD(k, Ω) is proportional to the dielectric permittivity of the beam

and is given by the expression

eD(k, Ω(k)) ≡ 0.

where

bFeiϕ = eF(iΩ,−ik, u)eiϕ

;

bVeiϕ = eV(−ik)eiϕ

;

bLeiϕ = eL(iΩ,−ik)eiϕ.

Note that the wave frequency has the following symmetry property:

Ω∗(k) = −Ω(−k).

The functions E(zn; Tn) and F (zn, u; Tn) in equations (3.23) and (3.24) are the amplitude
function we wish to determine. Clearly, these functions are constants with respect to the
fast scales, but to this end they are allowed to be generic functions of the slow ones.

In order to specify the dependence of the amplitude functions on the slow scales, that
is to derive the desired amplitude equations one need to go beyond the ﬁrst order. The
ﬁrst step is to evaluate the right hand side of equation (3.22) corresponding to the second
order with the already found solution (3.23) and (3.24) for the ﬁrst order. This yields terms
(proportional to eiϕ) belonging to the kernel of the linear operator on the left hand side
of equation (3.22), which consequently give rise to the so called secular contributions to
the perturbative solution. If the spectrum of solutions to the dispersion equation (3.26) is
complex (as is in our case), terms proportional to e−2Im(Ω)θ appear on the right hand side
of (3.22). Since, the imaginary part of the wave frequency we consider small, the factor
e−2Im(Ω)θ is slowly varying in θ and we can replace it by e−2Im(Ω)Tn , where the slow temporal
scale Tn is to be speciﬁed later. This in turn produces additional secular terms, which need

8

to be taken care of as well. (Note that exactly for this purpose we have chosen two amplitude
functions at ﬁrst order). The procedure to avoid secular terms is to impose certain conditions
on the amplitudes E(zn; Tn) and F (zn, u; Tn), that guarantee exact cancellation of all terms
proportional to eiϕ and terms constant in the fast scales z and θ (containing e−2Im(Ω)Tn) on
the right hand side of equation (3.22). One can easily check by direct calculation that the
above mentioned conditions read as:

The above equations (3.31) and (3.33) are the amplitude equations to ﬁrst order. Note
that if Im(Ω) = 0 we could simply set F equal to zero and then equation (3.33) would
describe the symmetry properties of the original system (3.1) and (3.2) with respect to a
linear plane wave solution. However, we are interested in the nonlinear interaction between
waves (of increasing harmonicity) generated order by order, and as it can be easily seen the
ﬁrst nontrivial result taking into account this interaction will come out at third order. To
pursue this we need the explicit (non secular) second order solutions for f2 and V2.

Solving the second order equation (3.22) with the remaining non secular part of the
second order right hand side and then solving equation (3.18) with the already determined
f2 we ﬁnd

f2 = SF (k, Ω, u)E2e2iϕ + c.c. + F2(zn, u; Tn),

V2 = SV (k, Ω)E2e2iϕ + fV eiϕ + c.c. + GV (zn, Tn; [F ]),

9

(3.34)

(3.35)

where c.c. denotes complex conjugation. Without loss of generality we can set the generic
function F2(zn, u; Tn) equal to zero. Note that, in case Im(Ω) = 0 we could have set F = 0,
as mentioned earlier, but we should keep the function F2 nonzero in order to cancel third
order secular terms depending on the slow scales only. Moreover, the functions SF , SV , fV
and the functional GV ([F ]) of the amplitude F are given by the following expressions:

The last step consists in evaluating the right hand side of equation (3.22), corresponding
to the third order with the already found ﬁrst and second order solutions. Removal of

Equations (3.41) and (3.42) comprise the system of coupled amplitude equations for
the intensity of a resonator wave with a wave number k and the slowly varying part of
the longitudinal distribution function. Note that the dependence on the temporal scale
T1 (involving derivatives with respect to T1) in equations (3.41) and (3.42) through the

operator bL1 and the function fV can be eliminated in principle by using the ﬁrst order

equations (3.31) and (3.33). As a result one obtains a system of coupled second order partial
diﬀerential equations for F and E with respect to the variables T2 and z1.

4 Concluding Remarks

We have studied the longitudinal dynamics of particles moving in an accelerator under the
action of a collective force due to a resonator voltage. For a suﬃciently high beam density
(relatively large value of the parameter λ) the nonlinear wave coupling, described by the
nonlinear term in the Vlasov equation becomes important, and has to be taken into account.
This is manifested in a spatio-temporal modulation of the wave amplitudes in unison with the
slow process of particle redistribution. As a result of this wave-particle interaction (coupling
between resonator waves and particle distribution modes) coherent, self-organized patterns
can be formed in a wide range of relevant parameters.

We have analyzed the slow evolution of the amplitude of a single resonator wave with an
arbitrary wave number k (and wave frequency Ω(k) deﬁned as a solution to the dispersion

11

relation). Using the method of multiple scales a system of coupled amplitude equations for
the resonator wave envelope and for the slowly varying part of the longitudinal distribu-
tion function has been derived. As expected, the equation for the resonator wave envelope
is a generalized cubic Ginzburg–Landau (GCGE) equation. We argue that these ampli-
tude equations govern the (relatively) slow process of formation of coherent structures and
establishment of wave-particle equilibrium.

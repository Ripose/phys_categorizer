Solitary Waves on a Coasting High-Energy Stored Beam

In this work we derive evolution equations for the nonlinear behavior of a coasting beam under
the inﬂuence of a resonator impedance. Using a renormalization group approach we ﬁnd a set of
coupled nonlinear equations for the beam density and resonator voltage. Under certain conditions,
these may be analytically solved yielding solitary wave behavior, even in the presence of signiﬁcant
dissipation in the resonator. We ﬁnd long-lived perturbations, i.e. droplets, which separate from
the beam and decelerate toward a quasi-steady state, in good agreement with simulation results.

I. INTRODUCTION.

Observations of long-lived wave phenomena have been made in stored high-energy beams for many years. For
the most part, these have been ignored or avoided as pathological conditions that degraded the performance of the
machine. However, in recent experiments, as well as in simulations, observations have been made which suggest the
occurrence of solitary waves in high-energy stored beams under certain conditions. Both from the point of view of
scientiﬁc curiosity as well as the importance of understanding the formation of halo in such beams, it is worthwhile
to study the physics of these nonlinear waves.

Of particular interest is the saturated state associated with high-intensity beams under the inﬂuence of wakeﬁelds, or
in the frequency domain, machine impedance. In stored beams, especially hadron beams where damping mechanisms
are relatively weak, a tenuous equilibrium may develop between beam heating due to wake-driven ﬂuctuations and
damping from a variety of sources. This state may well be highly nonlinear and may depend on the interaction of
nonlinear waves in order to determine the ﬁnal equilibrium state.
It is our interest in this work to elucidate the
conditions under which nonlinear waves may occur on a high-energy stored beam. This will then lay the groundwork
for a future study of the evolution of the beam under the inﬂuence of these nonlinear interactions.

We note that much work has been carried out already on solitary waves, [5], [6], [7], and references contained
therein, including those occurring on a beam under the inﬂuence of internal space charge forces [1], [2]. Our situation
is new in that we consider the speciﬁc form of a wakeﬁeld associated with a high-energy beam, namely when space
charge forces are negligible. This leads to a speciﬁc form of a solitary wave in a dissipative system, one which has
received limited attention in the literature thus far [9], [10], [11]. We have made both experimental observations and
carried out simulations which show the long-lived behavior of the nonlinear waves even in this dissipative case. It is
our aim to shed light on this case.

In this work we adopt an approach which is commonly employed in ﬂuid dynamics to arrive at a set of model
equations for solitary waves on a coasting beam under the inﬂuence of wakeﬁelds. It is based on the renormalization
group (RG) analytical approach, which is akin to an envelope analysis of the wave phenomena. The method in the
form we will use it was introduced by Goldenfeld [3] and expanded upon by Kunihiro [4].

In Section II we derive the amplitude equations for a resonator impedance following the standard renormalization
group approach. This results in a nonlinear set of equations for the wave amplitude and beam density. In Section
III we proceed to ﬁnd analytic solutions for this set which does indeed admit solitary waves. In Section IV we give
the conclusions of this study and outline the procedure for applying these results to the study of the steady-state
ﬂuctuations on a stored beam.

confused with the energy error variable. We will derive slow motion equations from the system (8) by means of the
renormalization group (RG) approach [3], [4]. To do so we perform a naive perturbation expansion

The amplitudes E, uo and Ro can be renormalized so as to remove the secular terms in the above expressions (22-
24) and thus obtain the corresponding RG equations. Not entering into details let us brieﬂy state the basic features
of the RG approach [4]. The perturbative solution (22-24) can be regarded as a parameterization of a 3D family of
= (Ro (To) , uo (To) , E (To)) with To being a free parameter. It can be shown that the RG equations
curves
are precisely the envelope equations for the one -parameter family

The solutions for the mean velocity of the soliton and the corresponding voltage amplitude are shown in Figs. 1
and 2 respectively. We note that the solitary wave corresponds to a self-contained droplet of charge which separates
(decelerates) from the core of the beam and approaches a ﬁxed separation at suﬃciently long times. The reason for
this behavior is the fact that the driving force due to the wake decays rapidly as the soliton detunes from the resonator
frequency. At suﬃcient detuning, the wake no longer contains enough dissipation to cause further deceleration. The
resonator voltage decreases in a corresponding fashion.
It is interesting to note that the charge contained in the
soliton remains self-organized over very long times despite the presence of dissipation. This situation is rather unique
and is due to the peculiar character of the wake force from the resonator.

FIG. 1. Mean velocity of the solitary wave due to a resonator impedance. Solitons decelerate at ﬁrst due to the dissipative
part of the wakeﬁeld. However, over long times, they approach a steady state where the wakeﬁelds have suﬃciently decayed
due to the ﬁnite resonator bandwidth.

10

FIG. 2. Voltage amplitude on the resonator. The voltage ﬁrst grows due to the longitudinal impedance, followed by
oscillations which result from the interference of energy between the solitary waves and the core of the beam. The envelope of
the amplitude eventually decays as detuning occurs.

In Figs. 3 and 4 we show the corresponding mean velocity and voltage from a coasting beam simulation previously
reported. The behavior is manifestly similar to that predicted by Eq. (35), (53) and (61) , though no attempt has
been made to check the precise scaling of the physical quantities.

FIG. 3. Mean velocity of the solitary waves from the simulation showing deceleration toward a ﬁxed maximum energy

separation. There is good qualitative agreement with the analytical result.

FIG. 4. Voltage amplitude on the resonator from the particle simulation. There is good qualitative agreement between the

analytical results and the voltage envelope shown.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this work we have derived a set of equations for solitary waves on a coasting beam using a renormalization group
approach. This procedure has led to a speciﬁc set of evolution equations in the practical case of a cavity resonator
of ﬁnite Q. The resulting set of equations can be solved analytically under certain assumptions, and this leads to an
explicit form for the soliton and its behavior over time. We ﬁnd, in contrast to other solitary waves in the presence
of dissipation, that solitons can persist over long times and do so by decelerating from the core of the beam. This
deceleration leads to detuning and the decay of the driving voltage. The result is that a nearly steady state is reached,
albeit with a gradually decreasing soliton strength, but ﬁxed maximum energy separation.

Good qualitative agreement between the analytic results and the simulations have been observed. We note that
such a process may well indicate a method by which well-deﬁned droplets can occur in the halo of intense stored
beams. Further study of this problem, and the application of the RG approach to bunched-beam evolution will be
considered in future work.

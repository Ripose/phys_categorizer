Abstract

Energy recovering [1] an electron beam after it has participated in a free-electron laser (FEL)

interaction can be quite challenging because of the substantial FEL-induced energy spread and the

energy anti-damping that occurs during deceleration. In the Jeﬀerson Lab infrared FEL driver-

accelerator, such an energy recovery scheme was implemented by properly matching the longitudinal

phase space throughout the recirculation transport by employing the so-called energy compression

scheme [2]. In the present paper, after presenting a single-particle dynamics approach of the method

used to energy-recover the electron beam, we report on experimental validation of the method

obtained by measurements of the so-called “compression eﬃciency” and “momentum compaction”

lattice transfer maps at diﬀerent locations in the recirculation transport line. We also compare

these measurements with numerical tracking simulations.

INTRODUCTION

Free electron lasers (FELs) driven by energy recovery linacs (ERLs) [1] are now established as

a generic conﬁguration for high average power light sources needed for industrial applications.

In such types of light sources, the ability of a linac-based driver to provide high electron beam

quality (small emittances and high peak current) is combined with the principal advantage of

ERLs: the beam energy is reused. Because the energy is recovered: (1) the radio-frequency

(RF) power demand is considerably reduced (the RF-power only provides RF-regulation

under steady state operation) and thus the wall-plug eﬃciency is improved, and (2) the ﬁnal

beam energy can be low and thus issues pertaining to high average current beam dumps

(dump design, radiological issues,..) are relaxed [2, 3].

The operation of ERL-based FELs presents many beam dynamics challenges. These latter

are principally related to energy jitter induced-instabilities [4], and to the proper longitu-

dinal phase space manipulation, the object of the present paper. During deceleration, the

fractional momentum spread of the beam becomes larger due to anti-damping and if not

properly controlled, can yield momentum spread beyond the acceptance of the downstream

beam-line.

A high average power (kW-level) infrared (∼ 5 µm) light source, the Ir-Demo, has recently

concluded operations at Jeﬀerson Lab. In this facility, which has served as a proof-of-principle

for an FEL operated using the so-called same-cell energy-recovery (SCER) scheme, careful

measurement of the longitudinal dynamics were conducted.

In the present paper we address the issues pertaining to the longitudinal phase space ma-

nipulations necessary in such ERL FELs. The paper is organized as followed: we discuss,

in Section 2, general aspects of the longitudinal beam dynamics in an ERL-driven FEL and

introduce the energy compression scheme.

In Section 3, we describe how in practice the

longitudinal phase space is manipulated for the speciﬁc case of the Ir-Demo FEL. The ex-

perimental characterization of this ERL light source is presented in Section 4. Finally, we

summarize our conclusions in Section 5.

II. LONGITUDINAL DYNAMICS

A generic ERL-driven FEL is pictured in Figure 1. The electron beam, assumed to be

relativistic (so that β ≃ 1 and the momentum equals the energy), is injected in the ERL

main linac with an energy of γo, and rms energy spread σγo. The main linac consists of

an RF-accelerating section providing an energy gain amplitude γrf and operating with a

phase ϕrf (the phases being referenced to the maximum acceleration phase). The undulator

is located downstream from the linac, after the beam has been compressed in a magnetic

bunch compressor. After participating in the FEL process, the beam is recirculated and

re-injected into the accelerating section (on the decelerating phase π − ϕrf ) via the so-called

recirculator. The recirculator has several functions:

1. it bends the beam by a total angle of 360◦,

2. it provides tuning of the transport path length (to re-inject the beam into the acceler-

ating section with the proper phase),

3. it provides variable tuning of bunch time-energy chirp.

In the Ir-Demo, the decelerated beam is split oﬀ the main beam-line by a dipole and the

beam is dumped.

The longitudinal dynamics is given by three requirements: (1) the beam incoming energy

needs to be matched to the FEL resonance condition, (2) the beam must have a high peak

current at the undulator location, and (3) the recirculator should be optimized to minimize

the momentum spread after the deceleration so the spent beam is cleanly dumped.

A. Operation of the free-electron laser

a. Energy gain through the RF-accelerating section: Downstream from the accelerating

section an electron, of coordinate s with respect to the bunch centroid, after the accelerating

pass gains the energy:

γU (s) = γo(s) + γrf cos(krf s + ϕrf ).

(1)

where krf stands for the RF-ﬁeld wave vector (krf

.
= 2π/λrf , λrf being the RF-wavelength).

The average beam energy, hγU i, at the undulator location, is: hγU i = hγoi + γrf cos ϕrf

b. The FEL resonance condition: Given the wavelength λ at which the FEL must operate,

the electron beam energy must fulﬁll the resonance condition:

γU =

(1 + K 2/2)

λu
2λ

s

where λu is the undulator period, and K the undulator parameter.

c. The minimum bunch length condition: Since the injector cannot directly provide the

required high-peak current, it is necessary to compress the electron bunch by means of mag-

netic compression. We characterize the compressor by its ﬁrst order momentum compaction,

RC

56, deﬁned as the linear dependence of the path length though the compressor on the frac-

tional momentum oﬀset δ. Under such a linear assumption, an electron of initial coordinate

(si, δi) is mapped to the ﬁnal longitudinal position as: sf ≃ si + RC

56δi. If we assume there

is no local momentum spread, the minimum bunch length (sf = 0) is achieved when the

incoming longitudinal position-momentum correlation satisﬁes the relation:

dδ
ds #s=0

"

= − 1
RC
56

.

|δ| ≪ |

RC

|,

In Eq. 3, we assume the fractional momentum oﬀset is small enough that second order

dependencies on this quantity are insigniﬁcant; i.e. we assume

where T C

566 denotes the second order dependence of the path length in the compressor on

the fractional momentum oﬀset. For an achromatic chicane, under the small bending angle

approximation, we have [6] T C

566/RC

56 ≃ −3/2.

Eqs. 1, 2 and 3 yield the following values for the required phase and amplitude of the

accelerating RF-section:

(6)

B. Recirculation

d. Longitudinal phase space after the FEL interaction: After the electron bunch has con-

tributed to the FEL process, an electron loses an energy of ∆Γ on average and the fractional

momentum spread of the bunch is increased. The average energy downstream from the

undulator is: hγU +i = hγU i − ∆Γ .

e. Longitudinal dynamics in the recirculator: As mentioned previously, the recirculator

provides a zeroth order optics knob:

it allows one to tune the path length in such a way

that the beam centroid is injected in the RF-section with the phase ψrf = π − ϕrf .

In

addition, the recirculator is used to manipulate the longitudinal phase space, because it

provides 360◦ bending and generates dispersion (to arbitrary order) which can be used to

control the linear and quadratic (and higher order) dependence of path length on fractional

momentum spread in the recirculator. Because the incoming momentum spread is large,

depending on the geometric arrangement of the bending system, a relation as in Eq. 4 may

not be satisﬁed, and hence higher order contributions to the longitudinal transfer map need

to be included. It is necessary to expand the longitudinal map to the second order in δ. Let
xU + = (x, x′; y, y′; s, δ)U + .
= (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6)U + be the coordinates of the electron at the
undulator exit and xR, those after the recirculation, i.e. at the linac entrance. Under the

single-particle-dynamics approximation, the transport from the undulator exit to the linac

entrance can be modeled by the longitudinal map Z that is generally Taylor-expanded:

which maps the k-th electron coordinate at the undulator exit to the entrance of the linac. We
now deﬁne the ﬁrst and second order Taylor coeﬃcient (following the transport conven-
) and Tkij = 1/2 × (∂2Zk)/(∂xU +
tion) as: Rki = (∂Zk)/(∂xU +

f. Deceleration for energy recovery: As the beam is decelerated in the RF-section, an

electron of coordinate s′ downstream of the recirculator will have the energy

γD(s′) = γR(s′) − γrf cos(krf s′ + ψrf ) ,

(9)

downstream of the RF-section. Here ψrf = π − φrf and γR is the electron energy before

deceleration (i.e. at the recirculator exit). From this latter equation the average energy takes

the form: hγDi = hγoi − ∆Γ. The quantity of interest after deceleration is the fractional
momentum oﬀset, δD(s′) = γD(s′)/hγDi − 1;

δD(s′) =

γrf [(krf s′)2/2 cos(ψrf ) + krf s′ sin(ψrf )]
hγU +i − γrf cos(ψrf )

+ δR(s′)

hγU +i
hγU +i − γrf cos(ψrf )

,

(10)

with δR(s′) being the fractional momentum oﬀset upstream from the RF-section before the

second pass. In Eq. 10, we have expanded the fractional momentum oﬀset up to the second

order in s′ because the incoming bunch length, σs′, does not a priori satisﬁes the condition

σs′ ≪ 1/krf . Eqs. 8 and 10 suggest a mechanism for counteracting the momentum spread

generated during deceleration. The method consists of setting up the recirculator in a way

to impart both a linear and quadratic a position-energy correlation, and allowing the bunch

to decompress before the decelerating pass. Formally one wants to match the linear and

quadratic dependence of δR to

(11)

where the latter equation insures the RF-induced curvature is canceled. The technique is

illustrated in Figure 3. In this ﬁgure, the last row contains the longitudinal phase spaces

downstream from the linac after deceleration for three diﬀerent choices of recirculator optics.

Plot (A) illustrates that the phase space slope should be properly chosen, as otherwise

excessive energy spread results. Once the slope is properly chosen, plot (B) of this last row

illustrates the importance of RF-induced curvature as an lower limit for momentum spread.

In plot (C) we show how, using the recirculator to impart a quadratic dependence of the

fractional momentum spread on the longitudinal position upstream from the linac, allows

the compensation of RF-induced curvature which, in turn, greatly reduces the fractional

momentum spread. In this latter case the fractional momentum spread is limited by a 3rd

order aberration (as seen by the “S” shape of the phase space).

III. EXAMPLE OF THE IR-DEMO

In the Ir-Demo (see top view in Figure 2), the electron beam, is generated by a 350 keV pho-

toemission electron gun [7], and accelerated [8] to ∼10 MeV by two superconducting

radio-frequency (SRF) CEBAF-type cavities (5-cell π-mode standing-wave cavities largely

of the same design as those in the CEBAF accelerator [9]) mounted as a pair in the so-called

“quarter cryounit”. The beam is then injected into the main linac which is composed of one

cryomodule, containing 8 CEBAF-type SRF cavities. The linac can provide a net energy

gain of approximately 37 MeV (but is operated to provide 28 MeV energy gain for the

results presented in this paper). The operating frequency of the RF-system is 1.497 GHz,

so λrf ≃ 0.20026 m. This cryomodule is followed by two 4-bend achromatic chicanes that

bypass the FEL resonator mirrors and provide longitudinal phase space manipulation. The

ﬁrst chicane, upstream from the undulator, serves as bunch compressor and the second

chicane naturally decompresses the upright bunch. The undulator is located between the

two chicanes. Soon after the downstream chicane the beam is recirculated, by the means

of a recirculator with variable (linear and quadratic) momentum compaction and path

length, back to the entrance of the cryomodule. The path length is chosen so the second

pass bunches have the proper time of arrival: the electron bunches are on the decelerating

phase of the radio-frequency wave. The electrons are decelerated down to 10 MeV and are

separated from the 48 MeV beam and dumped in the “energy recovery dump” by the means

of the “extraction chicane”.

A complete description of the driver-accelerator can be found in References [2, 5]. In terms

of the longitudinal beam dynamics, the ﬁrst matching point is at the undulator location

where a longitudinal waist (minimum bunch length) is required. Given the longitudinal

phase space at the injector front-end, the SRF-linac settings must be tuned in amplitude

and in phase for achieving the desired longitudinal phase space correlation, ≃ dδ/ds, to

match the momentum compaction RC

56 ≃ −28.8 cm of the ﬁrst chicane according to Eq. 3.

In the nominal operating conditions, the aforementioned requirements result in operating
the linac ϕrf =−10 ◦ oﬀ crest for an accelerating voltage of approximately γrf mec2 =37 MeV

to provide an FEL wavelength λ ≃5 µm. Downstream from the undulator the beam-line

consists of (1) a magnetic chicane similar to the one upstream but which now acts as a

bunch decompressor, and (2) a recirculation loop. The recirculation loop incorporates two

180 ◦ arcs linked by a straight line section, the “return transport line”, which consists of six

FODO cells having a 90◦ betatron phase advance per cell. The arcs are based on the MIT-

Bates accelerator design [10]; they each provide a total bending angle of 180 ◦. They include

four wedge-type dipoles, each bending the beam by an angle of about ±28 ◦ alternatively,

installed in pairs symmetrically around a 180 ◦ dipole. In addition to providing the desired

bending, the arcs are also used to adjust the total beam path length of the recirculated

beam. For such purposes, the arc is instrumented with a pair of horizontal steerers located

upstream and downstream the 180 ◦ dipole to vary the reference orbit path length inside

the 180 ◦ magnet. This provides a path length adjustment of the order of ±λrf /2 oﬀ the

nominal length (≃ 501.5 × λrf ).

Two families of quadrupoles (the trim quadrupoles) and sextupoles are installed in the arc to

provide both linear and quadratic energy dependent path length variation that are necessary

in the “energy-compression” scheme needed to properly energy recover the beam [11]. The

quadrupoles act both on the linear and quadratic momentum compaction of the recirculator
(these quantities are henceforth noted RU +→R

) while the sextupoles only impact

and T U +→R
566

56

the quadratic momentum compaction; the magnitude of the impact of these elements on the

momentum compaction is illustrated in Figure 4. When the quadrupoles and sextupoles

are unexcited, the arcs are operated in a non-isochronous mode (RA

56 = 13.1 cm for a single
180◦ arc). However under nominal operation, i.e. when the FEL is operating and the linac

is in energy recovery mode, because of the need for energy compression, the sextupoles and

quadrupoles of one family are excited to proper values in order to provide the required

parameters. The momentum compaction of the recirculation loop is related to those of the

individual components via:

RU +→R
56

= RC

56 + RA1

56 + RA2
56 ,

(12)

where the subscript C, A1 and A2 indicate the quantity corresponds respectively to the

“decompressor” chicane, the ﬁrst and second arc. Similar relations yield for the second

order momentum compaction.

IV. EXPERIMENT IN THE IR-DEMO

A. Measurement of the initial conditions at the undulator

Experimentally, the accelerator module amplitude is set up accordingly to numerical simu-

lation, then the phase is tuned to obtain the minimum bunch length at the undulator (i.e.

the highest peak current). The bunch length is monitored [12] by detecting the coherent

transition radiation (CTR) emitted in the backward direction as the electron bunch crosses

an aluminum foil adjacent to the undulator. The power density radiated by a bunch of N

electrons is

[

dP
dωdΩ

dP
dωdΩ

]N = [

]1 × (N + N(N − 1)|

+∞

−∞

Z

dtS(t) exp −iωt|2) ,

(13)

where [ dP

dωdΩ ]1 is the single electron power density. Thus since the Fourier transform of a
bunch with characteristic length σs extends to frequency ω ∼ c/σs, detecting the CTR at

frequencies close to this frequency provides indirect information on the bunch length. An

example of such a measurement is presented in Figure 5.

Once the phase is properly tuned, the bunch length is measured by performing Michelson

interferometry [13, 14] of the CTR signal, since the radiation pulse emitted by the electron

bunch mirrors the electron distribution. From the measured interferogram, one can deduce

the autocorrelation function and (in virtue of the Wiener Kintchine theorem) the power

spectrum of the CTR. A logarithmic Hilbert-transform [15, 16] of the latter power spectrum

allows one to reconstruct the electron longitudinal charge density. A typical measurement

of an interferogram along with the subsequent calculations is shown in Figure 6. Routinely,

the bunch length achieved in the Ir-Demo FEL is approximately 100 µm (rms) for a bunch

charge of 60 pC.

The fractional momentum spread of the beam is deduced from a proﬁle measured at the

high dispersion point of the decompressor chicane; the three quadrupoles upstream from

the chicane are used to insure the betatron contribution to the beam proﬁle is insigniﬁcant.

In Figure 7 we compare the fractional momentum proﬁles with and without operating the

FEL (the FEL process can be turned on/oﬀ by tuning/detuning the length of the optical

resonator). The typical rms fractional momentum spread before the FEL interaction is about

0.4%, which grows to to 1.2% downstream from the FEL when the laser operates.

At the undulator location, the bunch length has been minimized, the longitudinal phase

space is thus expected to be up-right; i.e. no position-energy correlation exists.

B. Experimental setup to measure longitudinal transfer maps

The measurements of the longitudinal transfer map Z is very diﬃcult. Instead, we perform a

perturbative measurement which provides information on the Taylor expansion of the map.

The technique consists of perturbing the initial conditions at a given location i (initial RF-

phase, φi = 2πsi/λrf , or initial energy δi) and measuring the relative time-of-ﬂight (TOF)

to a downstream position f (the time-of-ﬂight is also measured in RF-phase units). The two

aforementioned excitations allow the perturbative measurement of the ∂sf /∂si or ∂sf /∂δi

expansions of the map which gives (see Eq. 8):

∂sf
∂si = Rf →i

555 si and,

∂sf
∂δi = Rf →i

56 +

Xj

56j xj + 2T f →i
T f →i

566 δi.

(14)

(15)

Henceforth we will term ∂sf /∂si and ∂sf /∂δi respectively as “compression eﬃciency” and

“momentum compaction” maps, and we will instead work in RF-phase unit: ∂sf /∂si →

∂φf /∂φi and ∂sf /∂δi → ∂φf /∂δi. In essence, the measurement of the compression eﬃciency

or momentum compaction maps reduces to a relative TOF variation measurement.

Measurement of TOF is performed by detecting the phase of a signal produced by the

TM010 waves excited as the electron bunches traverse a resonant 1.497 GHz stainless steel

cavity [17, 19? ]. The principle of the TOF measurement is to measure the phase of the

beam induced voltage since it has constant phase with respect to the electron bunches. The

phase of the rf signal coming from the cavity is mixed with the reference signal, which may be

phase shifted by means of a programmable phase shifter. The mixer output, after removal of

high frequency component with a low pass ﬁlter, is calibrated by performing a procedure that

consists of varying the phase shifter to ﬁnd the output maxima from the mixer. Once the

measurement is calibrated, the phase shifter phase is set so that for the nominal conditions

of the machine the cavity is operated at zero-crossing of the mixer. Thus a change in TOF

give rise to a linear change in the mixer output.

The change in the TOF induced by perturbing the beam initial phase or energy condition

upstream can provide ∂φf /∂φi or ∂φf /∂δi respectively.

In the Ir-Demo the former kind

of measurement is performed by varying the phase of the photo-cathode drive laser (with

respect to the RF-master oscillator) whereas the latter type of measurement is done by

modulating the gradient of the last SRF-cavity of the cryomodule. In the accelerator three

pickup cavities have been installed. Their locations are downstream of: (1) the crymomdule

(C1), the (2) ﬁrst 180 ◦ (C2) and (3) second 180 ◦ arc (C3). To expedite the measurements,

the quantity varied (i.e. laser phase for ∂φf /∂φi transfer map and cavity gradient for ∂φf /∂δi

transfer map), is varied at 70 Hz during the acquisition of measurement data.

C. Numerical model for calculation of longitudinal transfer map

The measurement of the compression eﬃciency map provides important information on the

performance of the bunching process and can give some insights on the bunch length. Be-

cause the map is measured between the photocathode and the pickup cavities, it cannot be

simulated using standard single particle dynamics codes, but needs to be computed using
a particle tracking code, e.g. parmela [20], which includes non relativistic eﬀects such as

phase slippage eﬀects in accelerating cavities. The technique we have used to compare the
measurements with numerical simulations is as follows: we use parmela to generate uniform

macroparticles distribution over a given extent in RF-phase (or time) at the photocathode

surface. The corresponding phase of emission φi

k of the k-th macroparticle at the photo-

cathode surface is recorded and the macroparticles populating this uniform distribution are

tracked along the beam-line. For the tracking the space charge subroutine is not activated,

and each macroparticle is assumed to be the bunch centroid of bunches emitted at diﬀerent
drive-laser phase, we then compute the phase of arrival φf

k at the desired pickup cavities. The

couple ({φi

k, φf
to the experimental data.

k}k=1,...,N) directly gives the phase-phase transfer map which can be compared

In order to generate energy-phase transfer maps, we use the arbitrarily high order code
TLie [21] based on a symplectic integrator: the energy oﬀsets achieved when modulating

the gradient of the last cryomodule cavity are directly used by the code to calculate the TOF

up to the desired the pickup cavity. The couple ({δi

k, φf

k}k=1,...,N) provides the energy-phase

correlation and again can be compared with the data.

D. Path length adjustment

In passing we note that one of the installed detectors can also be used to precisely setup the

path length of the recirculator; in such a case the detector C1 is used. The beam is ﬁrst

dumped in the “straight ahead dump” (see Fig. 2) and the phase of the reference signal used

for C1 is shifted so that the signal at the mixer output is maximized. The beam is then

recirculated and the path length is varied using the dedicated horizontal steerers located

at both entrance and exit of the two 180◦ bends. The path length is optimized when the

signal measured at C1 is zeroed: this corresponds to the case when the beam induced voltage

generated by the ﬁrst pass and recirculated beams exactly cancel.

E. Experiments and simulations

The compression eﬃciency and momentum compaction transfer map measurement have been

extensively used during the commissioning of the Ir-Demo, to verify our model, but also in

routine operation, to insure the accelerator, and especially the recirculator loop, is properly

set up.

1. Compression eﬃciency

In Figure 8, we compare a typical measurements of the ∂φf /∂φi maps at the three diﬀerent

detectors (C1, C2, and C3) with the maps generated via simulations. We generally

observe a good agreement with between the measurement and the expectations. The slight

disagreement, e.g. as the one observed at detector C3, is attributed to mis-steering in the

arc 2 which makes larger the contribution of the T55j terms (with j = 1, ..., 4) in Eq. 14.

The second arc transport is more vulnerable to such misalignments since the bunch length

is larger compared to arc 1.

More quantitative information can be obtained by performing a nonlinear ﬁt of the transfer

map presented in the Figure. This can give some insight on the linear R55 and quadratic,

T555 compression eﬃciency coeﬃcients between the photocathode and the pickup cavities:

the results are presented in Table I.

The compression eﬃciency map measurement was also used as a trouble shooting tool.

In Figure 11 we present a series of measurement we performed using the detector C2: the

compression eﬃciency was measured for three settings of one of the quadrupole pairs of arc 1:

(a) the quadrupoles are excited to their nominal values, (b) they are turned oﬀ, and (c) they

are powered to a value opposite to case (a). The comparison of the measured transfer map

with the simulated one shows some disagreement (at that time we could not accurately know

precisely the machine settings of the upstream beam-line, e.g., in the injector). However, if

one compares the diﬀerence measurement (i.e. calculated as (b)-(a) and (b)-(c)) with the

corresponding diﬀerence simulations, the agreement becomes very good. Such an example

illustrates how a measurement of transfer maps for various perturbations of the lattice (here

using quadrupole pairs) can be used to verify that the diﬀerent lattice elements that compose

the beam-line perform as expected. This method was in fact used to diagnose a reinjection

phase error during commissioning [23].

2. Momentum compaction:

The momentum compaction transfer map was measured by modulating the gradient of the

last cryomodule cavity by ±1%.

The linear expansion of the transfer map, R56, was measured at both C2 and C3.

In

Figure 10, we compare the expected evolution of the linear momentum compaction for

diﬀerent excitations of the “trim quadrupoles” with the measurement obtained at C2 and

C3: the agreement is excellent. A more quantitative measurement was performed using

C2, the momentum compaction from the cryomodule exit up to C2 was measured as a

function of the trim quadrupole settings, the comparison of such a measurement with the
expected values obtained with the second order optics code dimad [22], again the good

agreement conﬁrms the usefulness of time-of-ﬂight diagnostics for setting up the recirculation.

The sensitivity of the momentum compaction map to second order changes in the optics, e.g.

imparted by the sextupoles, was also investigated. Figure 12 depicts the impact of exciting

one of the sextupole pairs of arc 2 on the map measured by the detector C3. The eﬀect

observed in simulations and measurements is the same: in both cases exciting the sextupole

impress a positive curvature on the map – though the agreement is not absolute. This can

again be explained by the sensitivity of the nonlinear terms to mis-steering via the second

order chromatic functions T56i (with i = 1, ..., 4). Especially when the FEL is operating, the

aforementioned eﬀect is enhanced because of the large FEL-induced fractional momentum

spread.

3. Other experimental evidence of energy compression:

The primary evidence of the good performance of the energy compression scheme was

our ability to recover 5 mA average current beam while lasing at high gain with an

average output power of 2.1 kW without any beam losses. The Ir-Demo is equipped with a

high sensitivity protection system that can detect localized losses of beam as low as 1 µA [24].

Another validation of the method is to observe the beam transverse density on the energy

recovery dump aluminum window. Such a measurement was performed by detecting the

backward optical transition radiation (OTR) emitted at the interface vacuum/aluminum of

the window. The OTR images are detected with a charge couple device (CCD) camera and

digitized for analysis. At the window the dispersion (horizontal) is η ≃ 1 m. The results of

our observations are presented in Figure 13: when the longitudinal compression is properly

tuned the beam is tightly focused whereas by slightly mis-setting one pair of sextupoles

(which does not aﬀect − to ﬁrst order − the lattice functions), the beam horizontal size

starts to blow-up, indicating relatively poor energy spread.

V. CONCLUSION

We have successfully characterized the energy compression scheme to recover the “spent”

electron beam after the FEL-process in the IR-demo. Such techniques are well adapted for

energy-recovering an electron beam in a moderate power FEL. For very high power FELs

anticipated in the future, higher order corrections and/or the use of a dedicated “acceler-

ating” section to impart the required position energy correlation might be needed. As an

example the forthcoming upgrade of the Ir-Demo to 10 kW requires the use of octupoles [25].

The techniques we have developed for characterizing the longitudinal lattice maps have

proven to be a valuable tool both during the commissioning of the Ir-Demo FEL but also

for its day-to-day operation: under the nominal setup of the recirculator the map pattern is

well deﬁned and changes of this pattern indicate one of the component in the recirculator or

RF-system is not properly set. However there is room for improvement: we have shown that

in some cases, e.g. due to mis-steering of the beam in the arcs, the extraction of quantitative

information from the transfer map may turn out to be diﬃcult. A way of improving this

situation is to measure the transfer map for diﬀerent steering conditions. By doing such a

“two dimensional diﬀerence orbit” measurement, one could get information on the coupling

terms (e.g. T55j or T56j) and thus correct accordingly the measurement to be less sensitive

to misalignment.

FIG. 11: Example of a diﬀerence compression eﬃciency transfer map measurement at the detec-

tor C2. The map is measured (A) and simulated (B) for three excitations of one pairs of trim

quadrupole in the arc 1 (quadrupoles set up to their nominal values, turned oﬀ, and set up to

a value opposite to their nominal value). Though the simulated and measured maps diﬀer, the

measured (C) and (D) simulated diﬀerence maps results are in better agreement.

INTRODUCTION
There is a growing interest in the production of intense
beams of exotic isotopes for research in nuclear physics
and laboratory astrophysics [1]. The Rare Isotope Acceler-
ator (RIA) is one such project being pursued by the nuclear
physics community in the USA [2]. RIA calls for a su-
perconducting cavity linac to accelerate the CW beam of
heavy ions to ≥ 400 MeV per nucleon, with a beam power
of up to 400 kW. Several types of superconducting struc-
tures are needed due to the changing velocity of the beam
[3].

Design studies are in progress at Michigan State Uni-
versity (MSU) for a 10th-harmonic driver linac consisting
of quarter-wave resonators (QWRs), half-wave resonators,
and elliptical cavities [4]. Three different types of QWRs
have been designed for the ﬁrst segment of the driver linac.
The ﬁrst QWR type (optimum b ≡ b m = 0.041, 80.5 MHz)
is very similar to existing QWRs in use at INFN-Legnaro
(b
is the beam velocity divided by the speed of light). The
second (b m = 0.085, 80.5 MHz) and third (b m = 0.16, 161
MHz) types are being developed as a collaborative effort
between Legnaro and MSU.

This paper covers the RF design, prototyping, and pre-
liminary RF testing of simpliﬁed versions of the b m =
0.085 and b m = 0.16 QWRs. The next step, the develop-
ment of a complete b m = 0.16 cavity with an integrated
helium vessel, is also underway [5].

CAVITY DESIGN
The quarter-wave resonators developed by Legnaro for
ALPI are the basis for the design of the RIA quarter-wave
cavities. QWRs at 80 MHz are presently being used at Leg-
naro for the ALPI and PIAVE linacs [6]; a 160 MHz QWR
has also been prototyped at Legnaro [7].

The ALPI cavities have a outer conductor diameter of
180 mm; this was enlarged to 240 mm for the b m = 0.085
and b m = 0.16 RIA cavities. A larger aperture (30 mm) is
also used for the RIA cavities. Another new feature is to
separate the cavity vacuum from the insulation vacuum to
reduce particulate contamination of the cavity surfaces.

A recent development is the identiﬁcation of beam steer-
ing due to the vertical asymmetry in QWR structures [8].
The steering is not a major problem for the b m = 0.085
QWR due to the long wavelength, but it is signiﬁcant in the

b m = 0.16 QWR. It has been shown theoretically that the
steering can be partially compensated by asymmetric shap-
ing of the cavity in the vicinity of the beam ports [9]. The
b m = 0.16 QWR incorporates asymmetric cavity walls to
compensate for the steering. Beam dynamics studies indi-
cate that the compensation should eliminate the emittance
growth due to steering [10].

Table 1 shows some of the parameters of the structures.
RF parameters were calculated with ANALYST.1 Draw-
ings of the structures are shown in Figure 1. Figure 2 shows
the accelerating voltage that can be delivered by each of the
cavity types at the design ﬁeld level (Ep = 20 MV/m) as a
function of the velocity of the accelerated beam, including
transit time effects.

FABRICATION OF PROTOTYPES
Sheet Nb of thickness 2 mm and RRR ≥ 150 was used.
The top plate, the beam tubes, and the tip of the center
conductor were machined from solid Nb. Holes were ma-
chined into the latter (see Figure 1) to improve the contact
with the liquid helium. The bottom ﬂange consists of a Nb-
Ti ring welded to the Nb outer conductor, mating with a
stainless steel (SS) blank-off ﬂange; a Nb tuning plate is
bolted to the outer conductor via this ﬂange. Forming of
the Nb parts was done at MSU and in the local area. Elec-
tron beam welding was done by industry. Figure 3 shows

the Nb parts before and after welding of the b m = 0.16 cav-
ity. Indium joints were used to provide a vacuum seal on
the bottom ﬂange and beam tube ﬂanges. Electrical con-
tact between the tuning plate and the outer conductor was
made via pressure from the bottom ﬂange (thus the indium
provides a vacuum seal, but not an RF seal). At Ep = 20
MV/m, the magnetic ﬁeld at the joint is about 0.7 mT for
the b m = 0.16 QWR and about 0.5 mT for the b m = 0.085
QWR.

Bead pulls were done to check the ﬁeld ﬂatness. Figure 4
shows the bead pull traces. The ﬁeld unﬂatness parameter
(D E/E) was 3.8% for the b m = 0.085 cavity and 0.6% for
the b m = 0.16 cavity.

The completed QWRs were etched with a Buffered
Chemical Polishing solution (1:1:2 mixture by volume of
concentrated hydroﬂuoric, nitric, and phosphoric acid) to
remove 120 m m from the inside surface. The acid was cir-
culated through a chiller in a closed loop system to main-
tain a temperature ≤ 15◦C. After etching, a high-pressure
rinse with ultra-pure water was done in a Class 100 clean
room for 60 to 120 minutes. The cavity was then assem-
bled onto an insert for subsequent RF testing. Figure 5a
shows the b m = 0.16 cavity during assembly onto the in-
sert. Figure 5b shows the b m = 0.085 cavity just prior to
insertion into the cryostat.

RF TESTS

RF testing was done with the cavity immersed in a liquid
helium bath at 4.2 K; some additional measurements were
done at 1.5 K or 2 K. A phase feedback loop was used to
lock onto the resonance. The RF power was provided by a
50 W ampliﬁer protected by a circulator. Copper probe an-
tennae (mounted on the bottom ﬂange, see Figure 1) were
used to couple the power into the cavity and pick up the
transmitted power signal. The input antenna length was
chosen to be near unity coupling at low ﬁeld at 4.2 K.

Multipacting barriers were encountered at low ﬁeld in

both cavities. We were able to get through the barriers with
1 to 2 days of RF conditioning at 4.2 K. The barriers were
not completely eliminated by conditioning; reconditioning
was required in some circumstances. No conditioning was
done at higher temperatures.
b m = 0.16 QWR

The ﬁrst RF test on the b m = 0.16 QWR was done in
May 2003. Results are shown in Figure 6a (circles). The
maximum ﬁeld level reached in the ﬁrst test was Ep = 8
MV/m. After the ﬁrst test, the cavity was disassembled,
and grinding was done to remove a suspicious area on
the shorting plate. An imbedded bit of foreign metal was
also found and ground out. After grinding, the cavity was
etched and rinsed again.

A second RF test was done in July 2003. A ﬁeld level of
Ep = 19 MV/m was reached in steady state (see Figure 6a,
squares). A higher ﬁeld (Ep = 23 MV/m) could be reached
with modulated RF (see Figure 6a, diamonds). These levels
were reached after some improvement from RF processing.
Helium processing was also attempted, but this did not fur-
ther improve the performance. Modest x-ray signals were
observed during the test (110 mR/hour was the largest ra-

diation level measured inside the radiation shield).

A system of mirrors was used to view the outside of the
cavity with a video camera placed on top of the cryostat.
At high ﬁeld, bubbles in the helium bath were observed
to come from the bottom ﬂange of the cavity, indicating
that the dominant losses were not in the high magnetic ﬁeld
region.

As indicated in Figure 6a, there was a decrease in Q0 at
very low ﬁeld, possibly due to resistive losses in the RF
joint between the outer conductor and the tuning plate. The
low-ﬁeld Q0 value of 1.8 · 109 at 4.2 K corresponds to a
surface resistance (Rs) of 19 nW
; the expected contribution
from the BCS term is 12 nW
. The low-ﬁeld Q0 was 3 · 109
at T = 2 K, corresponding to a residual surface resistance
(R0) of 12 nW
. Thus, the measured Rs at 4.2 K is a bit
smaller than expected from the sum of the expected BCS
Rs and measured R0. For Ep > 2 MV/m, the Q0 was the
same at 2 K as at 4.2 K.
b m = 0.085 QWR

Two changes were made for the b m = 0.085 QWR test
(in light of the problems encountered in the tests on the
b m = 0.16 QWR and the suspected causes). First, a ridge
was added to the Nb tuning plate for better RF contact with
the outer conductor. Second, a hollow tube was installed
on the bottom ﬂange to touch the center of the tuning plate
for improved heat sinking to the helium bath.

The ﬁrst RF test on the b m = 0.085 QWR was done in
September 2003. Results are shown in Figure 6b. A ﬁeld

level of Ep = 31 MV/m was reached. Above that ﬁeld level,
we reproducibly lost lock on the feedback loop, possibly
due to thermal breakdown. The measured x-ray signals
were ≤ 50 mR/hour. The video images indicated that bub-
bles were being nucleated more or less uniformly near the
top of the cavity, as one would expect for losses due to the
magnetic ﬁeld.

The low-ﬁeld Q0 value of about 3 · 109 at 4.2 K corre-
sponds to Rs = 6.3 nW
; the expected contribution from the
BCS term is 2.9 nW
. The low-ﬁeld Q0 was 6 ·109 at T = 1.5
K, corresponding to R0 = 3.2 nW
, in good agreement with
the measured Rs at 4.2 K and expected BCS contribution.

CONCLUSION
A b m = 0.16 QWR and a b m = 0.085 QWR have been
fabricated and tested. RF test results for the b m = 0.16
QWR are marginal. Further tests with improved RF contact
and better heat sinking of the Nb tuning plate are planned.
RF test results for the b m = 0.085 QWR have exceeded the
design ﬁeld level by a comfortable margin, with Q0 > 109
at the design ﬁeld (at T = 4.2 K). We were able to condi-
tion through low-ﬁeld multipacting barriers without a vari-
able coupler (1 to 2 days of conditioning were required).
The next steps in this QWR prototyping effort will be the
fabrication of complete cavities with integrated He vessels
and the characterisation of microphonics.

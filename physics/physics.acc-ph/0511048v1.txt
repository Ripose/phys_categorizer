Abstract

We have developed a high-eﬃciency pulsed slow positron beam for experiments
with orthopositronium in vacuum. The new pulsing scheme is based on a double-gap
coaxial buncher powered by an RF pulse of appropriate shape. The modulation of
the positron velocity in the two gaps is used to adjust their time-of-ﬂight to a tar-
get. This pulsing scheme allows to minimize non-linear aberrations in the bunching
process and to eﬃciently compress positron pulses with an initial pulse duration
ranging from ∼ 300 to 50 ns into bunches of 2.3 to 0.4 ns width, respectively, with
a repetition period of 1 µs. The compression ratio achieved is ≃ 100, which is a
factor 5 better than has been previously obtained with slow positron beams based
on a single buncher. Requirements on the degree, to which the moderated positrons
should be mono-energetic and on the precision of the waveform generation are pre-
sented. Possible applications of the new pulsed positron beam for measurements of
thin ﬁlms are discussed.

1 Introduction

Orthopositronium (o − P s), the triplet e+e−-bound state, is a particularly
interesting system for a search for new physics [1] - [5] and for high precision

tests of QED [6] -[8]. New experimental results on this system are expected by
improving the sensitivity of the previously developed techniques based on the
o−P s production in a low density SiO2 target [9]. Other possible experiments,
such as the search for mirror type dark matter via the o − P s → invisible
decay mode [10]-[12], precise measurements of the o − P s decay rate [13]
and others [14], require the production and subsequent decay of o − P s to
occur in vacuum. For these experiments a specially designed slow positron
beam operating in a pulsed mode with a repetition period of ≃ 1 µs has been
constructed. The construction of the beam has to compromise two main design
goals [10]: i) the time of the primary positron collection has to be comparable
with the repetition period in order to get the highest pulsing eﬃciency (the
ratio of beam intensities in the pulsed and DC modes) and to enhance the
signal-to-noise ratio; ii) a high beam compression factor of ≃ 100 has to be
achieved in order to obtain a positron pulse width of a few ns and to suppress
background for tagging of o − P s production.

Various techniques to produce pulsed positron beams have been reported with
the main focus so far on material science applications, for a review, see e.g.
[15,16]. The Munich group uses a pulsing scheme with two bunchers [17]. A
saw-tooth shape pulse is used in a pre-buncher to produce 2 ns pulses from the
initial pulse of 13 ns. Then, a 50 MHz chopper is used to eliminate unbunched
positrons and to increase the signal to background ratio. Finally, a 50 MHz RF
main buncher produces longitudinal compression of pulses from 2 ns to 150 ps
(FWHM) duration. A similar pulsing scheme is used by the Tsukuba group
[18]. For the vacuum experiments mentioned above, this method requires a
wide time window of chopping, and accordingly, the positron collection eﬃ-
ciency from an initial DC beam would become less than 1%.

A diﬀerent pulsing method has recently been considered by Oshima et al. [19].
The main idea is the same as for the RF method: the time-of-ﬂight for each
positron is adjusted according to the time it arrives at the starting point of
the acceleration. However, instead of applying a sinusoidal-like RF ﬁeld, a
more suitable pulse shape of the electric ﬁeld, with an approximate inverse
parabolic function of time, is applied to a single gap for the positron velocity
modulation [20]. This method has been further developed by Iijima et al. [21]
for material measurements in which the lifetime of orthopositronium atoms is
close to its vacuum value of ≃ 142 ns. For these applications it is necessary to
modify the originally proposed technique in order to generate higher intensity
positron beams by accumulating positrons over a wider time interval, even
though the bunch width becomes larger, but is still much less than the typical
measured timing intervals of ≃ 100 ns. Using a high permeability buncher core,
a bunch width of 2.2 ns (FWHM) for 50 ns collection time and a repetition
period of 960 ns has been achieved [21]. One of the problems encountered is
the limitation of the voltage supplied by a post-ampliﬁer to the buncher.

2

In this paper we describe a double-gap coaxial buncher powered by an RF
pulse of appropriate shape, which is produced by an arbitrary waveform gen-
erator (AWG) and by a post-ampliﬁer. This pulsing method allows to reduce
the inﬂuence of aberrations of the bunching pulse shape in comparison with
methods using a sinusoidal RF voltage and to achieve a compression ratio
limited mainly by the intrinsic energy spread of the initial positrons. In com-
parison with the one gap buncher method, see e.g. Ref. [19], the present scheme
requires lower bunching voltage and less post-ampliﬁer power 1 .

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: The beam prototype and the
new pulsing system are described in Section 2. The description of simulations
used to design the pulsing system is given in Section 3. In Section 4 the
results obtained with the pulsed beam are presented and the requirements for
the system components are discussed. Possible applications of the developed
pulsed beam for measurements in material research are discussed in Section
5. A summary is given in Section 6.

2 The pulsed slow positron beam

2.1 The actual beam

The preliminary design of the present pulsed slow positron beam has been re-
ported in [10]. Our primary consideration is that the system should be of the
magnetic transport type because this provides the simplest way to transport a
slow positron beam from the positron source to its target [22]. Fig. 1 and Fig.
2 show the schematic illustration of the developed pulsed slow positron beam
and the photgraph of the actual beam, respectively. The DC slow positrons
are produced by moderating the fast positrons emitted in β+-decays of the ra-
dioisotope source 22Na. This source, with a relatively small activity ( ∼ 50µCi)
was prepared by bombarding a 150 µm thick foil of pure Al with a 590 MeV
proton beam at the PSI accelerator (Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland).

Fig. 2. Photograph of the slow positron pulsed beam prototype.

The moderator, a tungsten W(100) single crystal foil with a thickness of 1
µm, is prepared in situ by annealing it at 2000oC (see Section 4). A few
eV positrons from the moderator are accelerated to 30 eV and are separated
from the fast unmoderated positrons by a 90o curved B-ﬁeld, serving as a
velocity ﬁlter. The eight coils provide a quasi-uniform longitudinal magnetic
ﬁeld of 70 Gauss to guide positrons down to the target - a microchannel plate
(MCP, Hamamatsu F4655-12), located at the end of the beam line and used
for positron detection. The beam energy can be varied up to a few kV simply
by applying the desired electrostatic potentials to the beam drift tubes.

The positron pulsing section shown in Fig. 1 consists of a chopper, the drift

tubes, and a buncher. The latter is constructed in such a way that its internal
tube (the buncher electrode) forms a coaxial line of 50 Ω impedance with
the external vacuum pipe. The buncher internal tube length of 135 cm is
determined by the distance-of-ﬂight of positrons entering the buncher during
the initial pulse and by their energy. For the initial pulse of 90 ns the repetition
period can be varied from 220 ns to inﬁnity. Initial positron pulses with the
desired duration are formed with the chopper grid placed 4 mm downstream
of the moderator foil, as shown in Fig. 3.
The potential diﬀerence ∆U =5 V between the moderator ﬁlm and the grid
is used for repelling the slow ≃ 3 eV positrons emitted from the moderator.
When the rectangular shaped chopper pulse of a given duration (50 - 300
ns, produced by a standard fast-signal generator), is applied to the grid with
an amplitude of about 5V, the moderated positrons come through and are
accelerated in the gap between the chopper grid and the ﬁrst drift tube.

2.2 The pulsing scheme for the buncher

The principle of the positron pulsing method is illustrated in Fig. 4. A non-
linear time-varying electric ﬁeld in the ﬁrst gap (Gap1) between the drift
tube 3 and the bunching electrode modulates the velocity of positrons in such
a way, that those (initially chopped and accelerated) positrons which arrive
early are decelerated at the gap, while those which reach the gap later are
accelerated. In the second gap (Gap2) between the buncher and drift tube 4 the
same procedure is repeated. The chopper pulse is synchronized with the AWG
trigger signal such that the chopped initial positrons passing the bunching
electrode receive the correct bunching voltage from the corresponding part of
the bunching pulse. Finally, the initially chopped positron pulse arrives at the
MCP target as a bunch of a small width.

The bunching voltage of the designed shape is produced by the arbitrary
waveform generator (AWG-510, Tektronix). The AWG output pulse is then

ampliﬁed by the post ampliﬁer 100A250A (Ampliﬁer Research) and is applied
to the bunching electrode. The ampliﬁer has an output power of 100 W and a
bandwidth of 10 kHz - 250 MHz, allowing to drive the 50 Ω coaxial buncher
with a pulse amplitude up to ≃ 80 V without saturation. The time proﬁle of
the bunched positrons at the MCP position is measured by using the MCP
signal as the TDC-START and the AWG signal as the STOP; the STOP signal
is also used to trigger the chopper pulse.

3 Design of the pulsing system

The simulations of the E- and B-ﬁelds, the beam transport and the velocity
modulation of positrons were performed with the GEANT4 [24] and 3D-Bﬁeld
[25] codes with the goal to minimize the time width of the bunch and to
optimize the shape of the bunching pulse.

The optimal shape and duration of the bunching pulse was calculated for
the given initial positron pulse duration by taking into account the following
criteria:

• the amplitude of the RF bunching pulse should be within ±80 V,
• after the velocity modulation positrons should arrive at the target as a

bunch within a time spread of ≃ 1 ns,

• absence of signiﬁcant non-linear distortions of the beam phase-space at the

target position

For the ﬁrst gap and for an initial pulse of e.g. 300 ns, a parabolic time-varying
potential V (t) ∼ t2 changing from -60 V (decelerating part) to +30 V has been
chosen, as shown in Fig. 5. The time dependence of the potential at the central
electrode of the buncher at times t > 300 ns can then be calculated, solving
the corresponding equations with an iterative procedure under the condition
that positrons arrive at the target simultaneously and that the potential at

the electrode at the end of the bunching pulse returns to its initial value -60
V. In Fig. 5 the resulting shape of the bunching voltage is shown for both
gaps.

In reality, the bunching pulse shape diﬀers from its ideal theoretical shape,
mostly due to the ﬁnite frequency bandwidth of the post-ampliﬁer and due
to non-ideal matching of the coaxial buncher curcuit to 50 Ω impedance. To
estimate the eﬀect, the response of the 100A250A ampliﬁer was simulated
according to its circuit characteristics [26]. The residual shape is deﬁned as
R(t) = Sout(t) − Sin(t), where Sin(t) is the input signal supplied by the AWG
with unit amplitude and Sout(t) is the ampliﬁer output pulse calculated for
unit gain.

It was found that for an initial pulse duration of 300 ns the deviation of
the response from the ideal shape shown in Fig.5 is not more than about
R(t)/Sout±1% over the full bunching pulse duration. The simulations show,
that such a signal deviation results in a negligible distortion of the bunched
positron pulse shape. The FWHM of the corresponding distribution has been
increased by less than 2%. However, for shorter initial pulses (< 100 ns ),
deviations up to about R(t)/Sout±5% have been observed. This will result
in a signiﬁcant degradation of the FWHM and shape of the positron pulses.
These results mean that the theoretical shape of the bunching pulse must be
reproduced within about ±1%. For an initial positron pulse duration of more
than ≃ 100 ns this is achievable.

emitted from the moderator. The best time resolution with the new bunching
method is about 2.1 ns (FWHM) for an initial pulse duration of 300 ns. It
is also seen that the shape and width of the distributions are aﬀected by the
cut, i.e. by the degree to which the moderated positrons are mono-energetic,
as expected from Liouville’s theorem.

4 Experimental results

4.1 Moderated positrons

It is well known that the spectrum of the longitudinal energy of moderated
positrons strongly depends on the quality of the moderator and can be signif-
icantly improved by annealing the W-ﬁlm in situ, see e.g. [23]. The moderator
annealing in our setup was performed at 2000oC by bombarding the foil with
an electron beam ( ≃ 25 W, 10 kV) for about 10 minutes in a vacuum of
≈ 10−8 mbar.

Fig. 7a shows the DC positron intensity as a function of the potential diﬀerence
∆U between the moderator and the chopper grid. The longitudinal energy
spectra are obtained from the derivatives of the corresponding intensity curves
and are shown in Fig. 7b. The spectra are taken before, ∼ 1 h after and two
days after the annealing. It is seen that the positron yield increases due to
annealing almost by a factor two. The FWHM of the energy distributions also
changes from ≃ 3 eV obtained before to ≃ 2 eV measured after annealing. The
spectra taken two days after annealing illustrate degradation of the moderator
surface through interactions with a residual gas, which results in a broadening
of the energy spectrum and a more isotropic re-emission of the positrons, i.e.
in an increase of the beam emittance.

4.2 Positron bunch width

In Fig. 8 the measured time distributions of pulsed positrons at the target
for are shown for an initial pulse of 90 ns and for diﬀerent values of the
retarding voltage between the moderator and the chopper grid. It is seen that
the FWHM of the distributions is very sensitive to the energy spread ∆E of the
moderated positrons changing from 1.4 ns to 0.63 ns, for ∆E ∼ 5 V (∆U =
+1 V) and ∆E ∼ 1.5 V (∆U = −2.5 V), respectively. It should be noted,
that the measurements shown in Figure 7 were performed by the retarding
potential method, using the grid as an energy analyzer. However, due to the
inhomogeneity of the electric ﬁeld formed by the grid, this method probably
does not have an energy resolution better than ∼ 1 eV and a signiﬁcant
contribution to the FWHM of the positron energy spectra can be expected.

The measurement results demonstrate that the degree, to which the positrons
emitted from the moderator are mono-energetic, is an important parameter.
Thus, it is crucial to have a well-conditioned stable moderator in order to get
a high performance of the beam. This observation is in qualitative agreement

In Fig. 9a, b the measured time distributions of positrons arriving at the
MCP are shown for initial positron pulse durations of 300 ns and 120 ns,
respectively. The FWHM of the distributions are estimated to be 2.3 and
1.4 ns. These values are comparable with those expected from Monte Carlo
simulations, see e.g. Fig. 6d. The compression ratio is ≃ 100, which is a factor
5 better than the values previously obtained by Iijima et al. [21], reporting
a compression from 50 ns to 2.2 ns, and by Tashiro et al. [27], reporting a
compression from 30 ns to 1.4 ns, respectively. For the bunch width of ∼ 2.3
ns and a repetition period of 1µs our pulsing eﬃciency is ≃ 31 %, which is
also a factor 6 better than reported in [21].

It should be noted, that the peak to (ﬂat) background ratio (≃ 102) of the
distributions shown in Fig.9a,b is in agreement with expectations from the
accidental coincidences of START and STOP signals from i) two diﬀerent
positrons, mostly due to the MCP detection ineﬃciency, or ii) from non-
positron related events due to the MCP noise. However, the non-Gaussian
tails of the distributions in Fig.9a,b (see also Fig. 10) are slightly worse than

to: i) the angular distribution of the moderated positrons and the fact that
they are not mono-energetic, ii) the extraction of slow positrons from the mod-
erator, iii) deviations of the pulse applied to the bunching electrodes from the
calculated ideal shape, iv) heterogeneous electric and magnetic ﬁelds, v) time
jitter of the detecting electronics, etc.

useful for many interesting applications, such as studies of polymers, coatings,
measurements of porosity of thin ﬁlms, etc [28]. In these studies information
on a sample structure is extracted from the results of the lifetime measure-
ment of o − P s formed inside the sample. The vacuum value of the o − P s
lifetime is shortened by collisional pick-oﬀ annihilation and ranges typically
from a fraction of a ns to tens of ns, see e.g. [28]. For high quality PALS
spectra measurements the important characteristics of the positron bunch at
the sample are: i) the bunch width, typically < 1 ns, ii) peak to background
ratio, typically ≥ 102; this is an important factor for accurate measurements of
low-intensity o − P s components, and iii) shape of the time proﬁle (resolution
function), typically one or two Gaussians with small tails. This is important
for measurements of short o − P s lifetimes.

The ﬂexibility of the developed pulsing scheme encourages us to test the gen-
eration of positron pulses with a width < 1 ns. To avoid the inﬂuence of
signiﬁcant bunching pulse distortions on the positron time proﬁle at the tar-
get, we try to eliminate them by using only a part of the bunching pulse,
where the aberrations of the shape are within a few % (typically, the aberra-
tions were signiﬁcant at the beginning and at the end of the pulse). For this
purpose the initial positron pulse was shortened to a desired duration by the
chopper pulse in such a way, that the chopped positrons passing the bunch-
ing electrode received the correct bunching voltage from the selected (central)

In Fig. 10 the results of these tests are shown for diﬀerent chopper pulse
durations, varying from 80 ns to 50 ns and a bunch pulse width corresponding
to an initial positron pulse of 90 ns. It is seen that a positron bunch width as
short as ≃ 400 ps can be obtained with this pulsing method. In Fig. 11 the
time distribution of Fig.10b is shown with a logarithmic scale for more details.
Although it has low statistics (because of the small 22 Na source activity the
counting rate is just ∼ 1 Hz) the FWHM and the peak to background ratio
(∼ 102) are compatible with the pulsed beams for application to polymer ﬁlms,

We think that further increasing the statistics with a higher activity source,
e.g. using the radioisotope 18F [29], and an improvement of the time proﬁle of
the bunched positrons results in a suitable beam for applications on thin ﬁlm
measurements.

6 Summary

We have developed a high-eﬃciency pulsed slow positron beam for experi-
ments with orthopositronium in vacuum. The new pulsing scheme is based
on a double-gap coaxial buncher powered by an RF pulse of a specially de-
signed shape, which is produced by an arbitrary waveform generator. With
the modulation of the positron velocity in two gaps, their time-of-ﬂight to a
target is adjusted. This pulsing scheme allows to minimize non-linear aber-
rations in the bunching process and to achieve a compression ratio limited
mainly by the intrinsic energy spread of the initial positrons. The ﬂexibility
of the new scheme allows us to eﬃciently compress the positron pulse with an
initial pulse duration ranging from ∼ 300 to 50 ns into a bunch of 2.3 to 0.4
ns width, respectively. A compression ratio of ≃ 100 and a pulsing eﬃciency
of ≃ 30% were achieved for a repetition period of 1 µs, which is 5 to 6 times

3 We assume that the convolution of this spectrum with a time resolution of ≃
200-300 ps of a fast BaF2 γ−detector, usually used for PALS measurements, will
not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the FWHM of the spectrum.

better than previously reported numbers.

Both, simulation and measurement results, demonstrate that i) the degree
to which the positrons emitted from the moderator are mono-energetic, and
ii) the precision of the bunching pulse waveform are important for a high
performance of the beam. This will require the possible construction of a
new, well-conditioned moderator with narrow (≤ 1 eV) londitudinal energy
spread of moderated positrons. In general, the developed beam is suitable for
experiments with o − P s in vacuum, mentioned in section 1.

Preliminary results on the generation of short positron bunches for PALS
applications are encouraging. However, further work to increase the beam
intensity and possibly to improve the time proﬁle of bunched positrons is
required.

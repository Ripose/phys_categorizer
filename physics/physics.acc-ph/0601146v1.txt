Cooling Experiment

Abstract. Ionization cooling of a muon beam is a key technique for a Neutrino Factory or Muon
Collider. An international collaboration is mounting an experiment to demonstrate muon ionization
cooling at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. We aim to complete the experiment by 2010.

INTRODUCTION

The experimental establishment of neutrino oscillations [1] has stimulated widespread
interest in a muon storage ring-based Neutrino Factory [2], possibly the ultimate tool for
studying the neutrino mixing matrix [3]. Two feasibility studies [4, 5] have shown that
a high-performance Neutrino Factory can be built using available technology. However,
some of the beam-manipulation techniques envisaged have yet to be applied in prac-
tice. Of these, ionization cooling of the muon beam [6, 7] is perhaps the most novel.
In the longer term it holds the promise of s-channel Higgs Factories and multi-TeV
muon-antimuon colliders, with potential for unique studies of matter and energy at the
most fundamental level [8], complementing those at the Large Hadron Collider and the
proposed International Linear Collider.

Ionization cooling contributes signiﬁcantly to both the performance (up to a factor
of 10 in intensity [9]) and cost (as much as 20% [5]) of a Neutrino Factory. This
motivates the Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE). MICE is intended not only
to demonstrate the principle of ionization cooling, but (and perhaps more importantly)
to show how to build and operate a device with the performance required for a Neutrino
Factory. The experience gained from MICE will provide input to the ﬁnal design of the
Neutrino Factory cooling channel and ﬁrm up its cost estimate. An important part of the
MICE program is to study the cooling process by varying the relevant parameters, so
that an extrapolation can be made to a different cooling-channel design, e.g., a ring [10]
or helical cooling channel [11], should one of these be shown to be advantageous.

During 2001 and 2002, the international MICE Collaboration [12] was formed and
developed a proposal [13] to carry out this program using a muon beam produced
with the ISIS accelerator at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL). The proposal
was approved in 2003. The MICE collaboration includes accelerator and experimental
particle physicists from Europe, Japan, and the US. As of this writing, funding for the

ﬁrst phase of MICE has been provided in Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the
UK, and the US. We aim for a deﬁnitive demonstration of ionization cooling by 2010.

DESIGN OF THE EXPERIMENT

The MICE design is presented in detail in the proposal [13] and Technical Reference
Document (TRD) [14], and is brieﬂy summarized here. The goals of MICE are

• to engineer and build a section of cooling channel (of a design that can give the
desired performance for a Neutrino Factory) that is long enough to provide a
measurable (≈10%) cooling effect, but short enough to be moderate in cost; and
• to measure the resulting cooling effect with an absolute accuracy of 0.1% over a

muon-beam momentum range of 140–240 MeV/c.

The layout of MICE is shown in Fig. 1. The tracks of single muons through the appara-
tus will be measured using standard particle-physics techniques, since bunched-beam di-
agnostics lack the needed precision. The 5.5 m-long cooling section, consisting of three
absorbers and eight rf cavities encircled by lattice solenoids, is therefore surrounded at
each end by tracking detectors, to measure beam emittance at the entrance and exit, and
particle-ID detectors to reject particles other than muons. This requires the placement
of tracking detectors close to the rf cavities and is therefore sensitive to backgrounds
caused by dark-current electrons and their associated x-rays. Improving our understand-
ing of such backgrounds is essential to the successful planning and execution of MICE
and is a much-anticipated result from upcoming tests by the MuCool Collaboration [15].
The cooling section is one lattice cell of the “SFOFO” cooling channel developed
in Feasibility Study II [5] (with minor modiﬁcations to reduce cost and comply with
RAL safety requirements), with a full absorber at each end to protect the detectors from
rf-cavity emissions. This arrangement provides considerable ﬂexibility, as the solenoid
polarities and currents can be varied to test a variety of lattices. Provision will be made
for a variety of solid absorbers as well as liquid hydrogen and helium. (In principle,
some other cooling cell could also be tested, perhaps in a subsequent MICE phase.)

Figure 2 shows the simulated effect of the cooling section on the normalized
transverse beam emittance, as well as the beam transmission, vs. that emittance, for
200 MeV/c average beam momentum and nominal optics settings of the SFOFO lattice
cell (3.2 T maximum on-axis ﬁeld). For input emittance below the equilibrium value of
2p mm·rad the beam is heated; above 6p mm·rad scraping begins to deplete the beam.
The detailed comparison of such measurements against Monte Carlo predictions, for
a variety of beam momenta, emittances, and apparatus conﬁgurations, will serve to
validate our Monte Carlo and design approach and allow extrapolation to the longer
(∼100 m) cooling channels typically used in Neutrino Factory designs.

Achieving 0.1% emittance resolution will require careful calibration and simulation.
Scattering of the beam in the detectors causes a correctable bias, as illustrated (for
input-beam emittance e t = 2.5p mm·rad) in Fig. 3 [16]: before correction, the transverse
emittance measured in each spectrometer is ∼1% larger than the “true” emittance. The
goal of 0.1% emittance measurement will thus require that this bias be calibrated and

the lower left and is measured by time-of-ﬂight (TOF) and Cherenkov detectors and a ﬁrst solenoidal
tracking spectrometer. It then enters the cooling section, where it is alternately slowed down in absorbers
and reaccelerated by rf cavities, while being focused by a lattice of superconducting solenoids. Finally it is
remeasured by a second solenoidal tracking spectrometer and its muon identity conﬁrmed by Cherenkov
and TOF detectors and a calorimeter.

corrected to ∼10% of itself (to be veriﬁed by calibration runs with no cooling section).

Tracking detectors

To minimize beam scattering and sensitivity to x-rays, the tracking detectors will be
thin (350 m m-diameter) scintillating ﬁbers, ganged by sevens to reduce the needed elec-
tronics channel count. Each group of seven adjacent ﬁbers is mated to a 1 mm clear
light-guide ﬁber that conveys the scintillation light to a VLPC photosensor. The >85%
quantum efﬁciency of the VLPCs [17] results in an average of 11 photoelectrons per

minimum-ionizing particle, as veriﬁed in cosmic-ray tests [16]. As in the D0 experi-
ment [17], the use of two staggered layers per view ensures high efﬁciency. Each spec-
trometer will be made up of ﬁve detector stations, each with three views arranged in
120◦ stereo, deployed within a 1.1 m-long 4 T superconducting solenoid. A prototype
4-station detector is now undergoing beam tests in a 1 T solenoid at KEK.

Particle identiﬁcation

The muon beam may contain residual pions which are transported through the large
momentum acceptance of the beamline, as well as electrons from the in-ﬂight decay
of muons. A three-plane time-of-ﬂight system provides the precise time information
needed for particle identiﬁcation, emittance measurement, and off-line bunch construc-
tion and timing with respect to the rf phase. Additional particle identiﬁcation is provided
before and after the cooling channel by Cherenkov detectors and a calorimeter.

STAGING AND CURRENT STATUS

The need to carefully cross-calibrate the spectrometers as well as the cost of the cooling
section suggest staging the installation and operation of MICE as indicated in Fig. 4. The
currently funded ﬁrst phase of MICE includes the detectors but not the cooling section;
the second phase will be assembled in steps as funds allow. At present the ﬁrst rf cavity
is under test in the MuCool Test Area at Fermilab, the Absorber/Focus-Coil and RF-
cavity/Coupling-Coil module designs are well advanced, and work is in progress on the
spectrometers, beamline, and infrastructure. First beam is planned for April 2007.

Radiation from a Superluminal Source

Abstract

The sweep speed of an electron beam across the face of an oscilloscope can exceed the
velocity of light, although of course the velocity of the electrons does not. Associated with
this possibility there should be a kind of ˇCerenkov radiation, as if the oscilloscope trace were
due to a charge moving with superluminal velocity.

1 Introduction

The possibility of radiation from superluminal sources was ﬁrst considered by Heaviside in
1888 [1]. He considered this topic many times over the next 20 years, deriving most of
the formalism of what is now called ˇCerenkov radiation. However, despite being an early
proponent of the concept of a velocity-dependent electromagnetic mass, Heaviside never
acknowledged the limitation that massive particles must have velocities less than that of
light. Consequently many of his pioneering eﬀorts (and those of his immediate followers, Des
Coudres [2] and Sommerfeld [3]), were largely ignored, and the realizable case of radiation
from a charge with velocity greater than the speed of light in a dielectric medium was
discovered independently in an experiment in 1934 [4].

In an insightful discussion of the theory of ˇCerenkov radiation, Tamm [5] revealed its
close connection with what is now called transition radiation, i.e., radiation emitted by a
charge in uniform motion that crosses a boundary between metallic or dielectric media. The
present paper was inspired by a work of Bolotovskii and Ginzburg [6] on how aggregates of
particles can act to produce motion that has superluminal aspects and that there should be
corresponding ˇCerenkov-like radiation in the case of charged particles. The classic example
of aggregate superluminal motion is the velocity of the point of intersection of a pair of
scissors whose tips approach one another at a velocity close to that of light.

Here we consider the example of a “sweeping” electron beam in a high-speed analog
oscilloscope such as the Tektronix 7104 [7]. In this device the “writing speed”, the velocity
of the beam spot across the faceplate of the oscilloscope, can exceed the speed of light.
The transition radiation emitted by the beam electrons just before they disappear into the
faceplate has the character of ˇCerenkov radiation from the superluminal beam spot, according
to the inverse of the argument of Tamm.

2 Model Calculation

As a simple model suppose a line of charge moves in the −y direction with velocity u ≪ c,
where c is the speed of light, but has a slope such that the intercept with the x axis moves
with velocity v > c. See Figure 1a. If the region y < 0 is occupied by, say, a metal the
charges will emit transition radiation as they disappear into the metal’s surface. Interference

among the radiation from the various charges then leads to a strong peak in the radiation
pattern at angle cos θ = c/v, which is the ˇCerenkov eﬀect of the superluminal source.

Figure 1:
a) A sloping line of charge moves in the −y direction with veloc-
ity vy = u ≪ c such that its intercept with the x axis moves with velocity
vx = v > c. As the charge disappears into the conductor at y < 0 it emits
transition radiation. The radiation appears to emanate from a spot moving
at superluminal velocity and is concentrated on a cone of angle cos−1(c/v). b)
The angular distribution of the radiation is discussed in a spherical coordinates
system about the x axis.

To calculate the radiation spectrum we use equation (14.70) from the textbook of Jackson

[8]:

4π2c3 (cid:20)Z dt d3r bn × j(r, t)eiω(t−(bn·r)/c)(cid:21)2

,

(1)

where dU is the radiated energy in angular frequency interval dω emitting into solid angle

dΩ, j is the source current density, and bn is a unit vector towards the observer.

The line of charge has equation

y =

x − ut,

z = 0,

so the current density is

j = −byNeδ(z)δ(cid:18)t −

y

u(cid:19) ,

(3)

where N is the number of electrons per unit length intercepting the x axis, and e < 0 is the
electron’s charge.

We also consider the eﬀect of the image current,

jimage = +by(−Ne)δ(z)δ(cid:18)t −

x
v

−

y

u(cid:19) .

(4)

We will ﬁnd that to a good approximation the image current just doubles the amplitude of
the radiation. For u ∼ c the image current would be related to the retarded ﬁelds of the
electron beam, but we avoid this complication when u ≪ c. Note that the true current exists
only for y > 0, while the image current applies only for y < 0.

We integrate using rectangular coordinates, with components of the unit vector n given

by

nx = cos θ,

ny = sin θ cos φ,

and

nz = sin θ sin φ,

(5)

as indicated in Fig. 1b. The current impinges only on a length L along the x axis. The
integrals are elementary and we ﬁnd, noting ω/c = 2π/λ,

The factor of form sin2 χ/χ2 appears from the x integration, and indicates that this leads to
a single-slit interference pattern.

We will only consider the case that u ≪ c, so from now on we approximate the factor
c2 sin2 θ cos2 φ by 1.
Upon integration over the azimuthal angle φ from −π/2 to π/2 the factor cos2 θ +

sin2 θ sin2 φ becomes π

It is instructive to replace the radiated energy by the number of radiated photons: dU =

the argument χ = πL
− cos θ) can never become zero, and the diﬀraction pattern never
achieves a principal maximum. The radiation pattern remains a slightly skewed type of
transition radiation. However, for v > c we can have χ = 0, and the radiation pattern has a
large spike at angle θ ˇC such that

which we identify with ˇCerenkov radiation. Of course the side lobes are still present, but
not very prominent.

3 Discussion

The present analysis suggests that ˇCerenkov radiation is not really distinct from transition
radiation, but is rather a special feature of the transition radiation pattern which emerges
under certain circumstances. This viewpoint actually is relevant to ˇCerenkov radiation in
any real device which has a ﬁnite path length for the radiating charge. The walls which deﬁne
the path length are sources of transition radiation which is always present even when the
ˇCerenkov condition is not satisﬁed. When the ˇCerenkov condition is satisﬁed, the so-called
formation length for transition radiation becomes longer than the device, and the ˇCerenkov
radiation can be thought of as an interference eﬀect.

If L/λ ≫ 1, then the radiation pattern is very sharply peaked about the ˇCerenkov angle,

and we may integrate over θ noting

In this we have replaced cos2 θ by c2/v2 in the vicinity of the ˇCerenkov angle. We have also
extended the limits of integration on χ to [−∞, ∞]. This is not a good approximation for
v < c, in which case χ > 0 always and dNω is much less than stated. For v = c the radiation
rate is still about one half of the above estimate.

For comparison, the expression for the number of photons radiated in the ordinary

ˇCerenkov eﬀect is

dNω ∼ 2πα

(10)

The ordinary ˇCerenkov eﬀect vanishes as θ2
ˇC near the threshold, but the superluminal eﬀect
does not. This is related to the fact that at threshold ordinary ˇCerenkov radiation is emitted
at small angles to the electron’s direction, while in the superluminal case the radiation is at
right angles to the electron’s motion. In this respect the moving spot on an oscilloscope is
not fully equivalent to a single charge as the source of the ˇCerenkov radiation.

In the discussion thus far we have assumed that the electron beam is well described by a
uniform line of charge. In practice the beam is discrete, with ﬂuctuations in the spacing and
energy of the electrons. If these ﬂuctuations are too large we cannot expect the transition
radiation from the various electrons to superimpose coherently to produce the ˇCerenkov
radiation. Roughly, there will be almost no coherence for wavelengths smaller than the
actual spot size of the electron beam at the metal surface, Thus there will be a cutoﬀ at high
frequencies which serves to limit the total radiated energy to a ﬁnite amount, whereas the
expression derived above is formally divergent. Similarly the eﬀect will be quite weak unless
the beam current is large enough that Nλ ≫ 1.

We close with a numerical example inspired by possible experiment. A realistic spot size
for the beam is 0.3 mm, so we must detect radiation at longer wavelengths. A convenient
choice is λ = 3 mm, for which commercial microwave receivers exist. The bandwidth of a
candidate receiver is dω/ω = 0.02 centered at 88 GHz. We take L = 3 cm, so L/λ = 10

4

and the ˇCerenkov ‘cone’ will actually be about 5◦ wide, which happens to match the angular
resolution of the microwave receiver. Supposing the electron beam energy to be 2.5 keV, we
would have u2/c2 = 0.01. The velocity of the moving spot is taken as v = 1.33c = 4 × 1010
cm/sec, so the observation angle is 41◦. If the electron beam current is 1 µA then the number
of electrons deposited per cm along the metal surface is N ∼ 150, and Nλ ∼ 45.

Inserting these parameters into the rate formula we expect about 7 × 10−3 detected
photons from a single sweep of the electron beam. This supposes we can collect over all
azimuth φ which would require some suitable optics. The electron beam will actually be
swept at about 1 GHz, so we can collect about 7×106 photons per second. The corresponding
signal power is 2.6 × 10−25 Watts/Hz, whose equivalent noise temperature is about 20 mK.
This must be distinguished from the background of thermal radiation, the main source of
which is in the receiver itself, whose noise temperature is about 100◦K [9]. A lock-in ampliﬁer
could be used to extract the weak periodic signal; an integration time of a few minutes of
the 1-GHz-repetition-rate signal would suﬃce assuming 100% collection eﬃciency.

Realization of such an experiment with a Tektronix 7104 oscilloscope would require a
custom cathode ray tube that permits collection of microwave radiation through a portion
of the wall not coated with the usual metallic shielding layer [10].

4 Appendix: Bremsstrahlung

Early reports of observation of transition radiation were considered by sceptics to be due
to bremsstrahlung instead. The distinction in principle is that transition radiation is due
to acceleration of charges in a medium in response to the far ﬁeld of a uniformly moving
charge, while bremsstrahlung is due to the acceleration of the moving charge in the near ﬁeld
of atomic nuclei. In practice both eﬀects exist and can be separated by careful experiment.
Is bremsstrahlung stronger than transition radiation in the example considered here?
As shown below the answer is no, but even if it were we would then expect a ˇCerenkov-like
eﬀect arising from the coherent bremsstrahlung of the electron beam as it hits the oscilloscope
faceplate.

The angular distribution of bremsstrahlung from a nonrelativistic electron will be sin2 θ
with θ deﬁned with respect to the direction of motion. The range of a 2.5-kev electron in,
say, copper is about 5 × 10−6 cm [11] while the skin depth at 88 GHz is about 2.5 × 10−5 cm.
Hence the copper is essentially transparent to the backward hemisphere of bremsstrahlung
radiation, which will emerge into the same half space as the transition radiation.

The amount of bremsstrahlung energy dUB emitted into energy interval dU is just Y dU
where Y is the so-called bremsstrahlung yield factor. For 2.5-keV electrons in copper, Y =
3 ×10−4 [11]. The number dN of bremsstrahlung photons of energy ¯hω in a bandwidth dω/ω
is then dN = dUB/¯hω = Y dω/ω. For the 2% bandwidth of our example, dN = 6 × 10−6 per
beam electron. For a 3-cm-long target region there will be 500 beam electrons per sweep of
the oscilloscope, for a total of 3 × 10−4 bremsstrahlung photons into a 2% bandwidth about
88 GHz. Half of these emerge from the faceplate as a background to 7 × 10−3 transition-
radiation photons per sweep. Altogether, the bremsstrahlung contribution would be about
1/50 of the transition-radiation signal in the proposed experiment.

We have theoretically shown that the yield of diﬀuse radiation generated by relativistic electrons
passing random multilayered systems can be increased when a resonant condition is met. Resonant
condition can be satisﬁed for the wavelength region representing visible light as well as soft X-rays.
The intensity of diﬀusive soft X-rays for speciﬁc multilayered systems consisting of two components
is compared with the intensity of Cherenkov radiation. For radiation at photon energy of 99.4eV ,
the intensity of Resonant Diﬀusive Radiation (RDR) generated by 8M eV electrons passing a Be/Si
multilayer exceeds the intensity of Cherenkov radiation by a factor of ≈ 130 for electrons with the
same energy passing a Si foil. For a photon energy of 453eV and 9.3M eV electrons passing Be/T i
multilayer generate RDR exceeding Cherenkov radiation generated by electrons passing a T i foils
by a factor ≈ 51.

INTRODUCTION

Recently radiation generated by relativistic electrons
passing through periodic multilayer structures have re-
ceived increased attention [1]-[3].This has particularly
been enabled by the availability of multilayers with pe-
riodicities in the nm scale. Yamada and Hosokava [2]
demonstrated Resonant Transition Radiation RTR [4]-
[6] to be applicable as a radiation source in the wave-
length region λ < 1nm. This was achieved by 15M eV
electrons passing a periodic multilayer with 176nm thick
nickel layers as radiator and 221nm thick carbon layers
as a spacer. As the RTR intensity is proportional to
ε2(ω)]2, where ε1 and ε2 are the dielectric con-
[ε1(ω)
stants of the multilayer components, a sharp increase can
be expected around inner-shell absorption edges [1].

In the X-ray region the dielectric constant can be de-
scribed by the plasma formula and usually is less than
unity. However,
in narrow region around absorption
edges of some materials the dielectric constant can ex-
ceed unity. This means that the condition for Cherenkov
radiation (CR) can be fulﬁlled even in the X-ray region.
The intensity of CR is proportional to ε(ω)

Bazylev and et al [7] demonstrated the generation of
CR around the K absorption edge of C from 1.2GeV
electrons passing a carbon containing foil. More recently
Knulst et al [8] used 5M eV electrons to generate CR
99M eV and 10M eV
around the Si L absorption edge
electrons to generate CR around L edges of V (512eV )
and T i(453eV ).

Previously we showed that Diﬀusive Radiation(DR)
generated by relativistic electrons passing a randomly
distributed multilayer system can provide an alternative
for a source with a high radiation yield [9]. Experimen-
tal evidence in favor of this mechanism was provided by
L.C.Yuan and et al [10] who conducted experiments on

∗e-mail:gevork@yerphi.am

radiation generated by relativistic electrons passing a sys-
tem of microspheres, distributed randomly in a dielectric
material. The observed strong dependence of the radia-
tion intensity as a function of the particle energy could
only be explained by the DR mechanism [11].
In this
paper we discuss the inﬂuence of a resonance eﬀect on
the yield of Diﬀusive Radiation (RDR). As the resonant
condition requires that n exceeds 1, this eﬀect can for ra-
diation in the soft x-ray region only be achieved around
selected absorption edges representing an atomic inner-
shell of an element. Our paper explicitly deals with the
generation of Resonant Diﬀuse Radiation around these
inner-shell absorption edges. A complicating factor for
this short wavelength region is that DR requires a low
absorption to enable multiple scattering. Nevertheless
we have shown that when a resonance condition is met
related to the anomalous behavior of dielectric constant
around an adsorption edge, the yield resulting from RDR
exceeds the yield of CR in this soft x-ray region.

INITIAL RELATIONS

Let us consider radiation from a charged particle uni-
formly moving in a homogeneous medium with randomly
embedded parallel foils in it. The origin of the radiation
can be explained as follows. Each charged particle cre-
ates an electromagnetic ﬁeld around it which is not yet
photon but a pseudophoton. These pseudophotons are
scattered on the inhomogeneities of dielectric constant
and convert into real photons. We consider the radia-
tion due to scattering of pseudophotons which includes
also the conventional transition radiation(TR). We do
not consider the bremsstrahlung and Cherenkov radia-
tion which have diﬀerent origin. We have shown [9] that
the radiation intensity can be represented as a sum of two
contributions. One is the contribution by single scatter-
ing and the another is the contribution caused by mul-
tiple scattering of pseudophotons. The single scattering
contribution actually is TR from randomly spaced inter-
faces. However here we are interested in the contribution

by multiple scattering [9], as it was shown that it leads to
the diﬀusion of pseudophotons. As demonstrated in [9] a
simpliﬁed expression for the yield for DR can be achieved
by introducing a random multilayer system with Gaus-
sian distribution of distances between the foils. It should
be emphasised that other random systems are not ex-
cluded to be applicable. The statistical properties of the
Gaussian distribution enters to the solution through the
elastic mean free path of the photons.

That means that in a real system the randomness cre-
ated by the parallel foils should fulﬁll the requirement to
treat the dielectric constant as Gaussian distributed ran-
dom function. For a large number of foils N
1, in the
wavelength range λ
l (where l is the photon mean free
path in the normal to the foils direction, for more details
see [9]) diﬀusion contribution to the radiation intensity
is the main one and given by the formula

ment of photon yield appears as a result of constructive
interference.

the electromagnetic ﬁeld. However a weak absorption

more detail.

III. RESONANT EMISSION

fusive Radiation is proportional to the square of particle

It follows from Eqs.(1), (3) and (4) that when v is such
that γ−2
m = 0 (resonant condition) the radiation inten-
the radiation
sity drastically increases. When γm → ∞
intensity also becomes inﬁnite. However physically this
is impossible. This inﬁnity arises because in theoretical
consideration we assumed the system size inﬁnite. How-
ever in reality the system size is ﬁnite and the intensity
even at the resonance point also will be ﬁnite. Now con-
sider the resonance condition γ−2
m = 0 in the optical and
X-ray regions, respectively. In the optical region taking
vacuum as a homogeneous medium, ε0 = 1 and assuming
c, from Eq.(4), one gets
for relativistic electrons that v

v2/c2)−1/2 is the Lorentz factor of the
where γ = (1

in this region has the form γ−2 = δ and weakly depends
on the frequency.

Now consider the X-ray region. Assuming that ε0 =

In the X-ray region one usually has δs, δf > 0 and the res-
onance condition γ−2
m = 0 can not be fulﬁlled. However
in the atomic inner-shell region the dielectric constant
can resonantly increase and exceed unity, [1],[15]. This
means that for those frequencies, for example, one can
have δf (ω) < 0. As is seen from Eq.(6) if δf (ω) < 0 then
a resonant γ2
is possible in the X-ray region too.
The corresponding X-ray spectrum will be quite narrow
because the region where εf (ω) exceeds unity is small.

m → ∞

It should be emphasized that the resonance condition
γ−2
m = 0 is the Cherenkov condition for the average di-
electric constant. Hence one can say that RDR origins
from the interaction of two processes. The Cherenkov
condition creates resonantly large number of pseudopho-
tons and multiple scattering converts them into real pho-
tons.

Although the resonant condition is the same as for
Cherenkov radiation,the essence of RDR completely dif-
ferent. While CR is based on interference of wave fronts

and inhomogeneity is not needed for its generation, DR
is caused by multiple scattering of pseudophotons on in-
homogeneities. We show below that in some cases the
photon yield in RDR can exceed that one in CR.

IV. ELASTIC AND INELASTIC MEAN FREE
PATHS

The elastic mean free paths appearing in Eqs.(1) and
(3) correspond to the photons falling in under the nor-
mal of the foils although those expressions determine the
radiation intensity for all angles except for a small region
. The photon mean free path in the medium is related to
the transmission coeﬃcient t(ω) through a foil [14]

neglecting strongly oscillating terms in the geometrical

optics region, one has l(ω)
1/n. Thus in this region
≈
the photon elastic mean free path does not depend on fre-
quency and the radiation intensity is maximal. Usually,
in the X-region
1 it is therefore diﬃcult
1
to satisfy the condition of applicability of geometrical
optics. However, for the atomic inner shell frequencies
the dielectric constant some times, even in the X-ray re-
gion, can exceed unity [15] and for those frequencies the
geometrical optics condition
1 is ful-
ﬁlled. Now about the photon inelastic mean free path.
In the frequency region we are mainly interested in the
dominant mechanism of inelastic interaction of photon
with the medium is the photoabsorption. Therefore the
inelastic mean free path can be represented in the form

V. ABSORPTION OF RDR PHOTONS IN THE
MEDIUM

Above we have discussed the absorption of pseudopho-
tons in the random medium. However already formed
real photons also will be absorbed in the medium. There-
fore to know what part of already created real photons
will escape the system one should take into account the
absorption of real photons in the medium. Suppose that
we are interested in the photon yield from the depth z
in the material. Using Eq.(3) and adding an exponential
decaying factor which takes into account the diﬀerence of
paths of photons with diﬀerent emitted angles, one has

Here dI
dz is the spectral-angular radiation intensity per
unit length of electron path in the medium. Note the
suppression of radiation intensity at very large angles.
The real DR photons are formed in the eﬀective size
(llin)1/2. Therefore when ﬁnding the total radiation in-
tensity one should cut the integral in the lower limit on
this length.After integration for total spectral angular in-
tensity, we have

So as one could anticipate the absorption of real DR pho-
tons leads to the cutoﬀ of radiation intensity at large
angles and maximum lies at medium angles.

VI. QUALITATIVE ESTIMATES FOR SPECIFIC
ELEMENTS

We have shown that resonant emission of radiation in-
tensity is possible in a system with one-dimensional ran-
domness of the dielectric constant. Resonant emission is
possible in the optical as well as in the X-ray regions.
The latter case is most interesting because it forms high
bright soft X-ray source using MeV electrons, [1], [3].

One of the main conditions for realization of diﬀusive
l. The minimal value of
radiation mechanism is lin ≫
1/n.
l is reached in the geometrical optics region, l
The geometrical optics approximation for l is justiﬁed
provided that

as well as RDR within the same wavelength are gen-
erated. While the emission angle of Cherenkov radia-
tion is ﬁxed at cosθ = c/v√ε, RDR is emitted within a
wide angular distribution. We omit the angular part in
(13) for simplicity. Consider the conditions of generation
of RDR for speciﬁc structures using the data from [16].
First consider the structure Be/Si at the photon energy
ω = 99.4eV near the L3 edge of Si. Note that we take the
photon energy at the long wavelength side of the Si L3
ω = 99.8eV edge where the absorption weaker. However
10−3
for 99.4eV the refractive index nSi(ω) = 1 + 11.56
10−3
4.27
still exceeds unity. Using also that nBe = 1
one can be convinced that the geometrical optics approx-
imation is valid provided that a > 130nm. The pho-
ton attenuation length at ω = 99.4eV in Si and Be is
0.55µm and 0.76µm, respectively [16]. Therefore if one
takes the average distance d between Si foils
130nm,
the elastic and inelastic mean free paths of photon ap-
proximately can be estimated as l
130nm and
0.62µm. As a result the photon multiple scattering
lin ∼
l is fulﬁlled. Now let us ﬁnd the resonant
condition lin ≫
electron energy. Using the above mentioned values of re-
fraction index for Be and Si, assuming the ﬁlling factor of
Si approximately, na
1/2, one ﬁnds from Eq.(6),that
γr = 16.67. Correspondingly the resonant electron en-
ergy will be Er = 8.33M eV . Now estimate the ratio
I D/I C using Eq.(13). For a photon energy ω = 99.4eV
for l = 130nm, the factor 1/kl
0.01. As at the res-
onance point our formulae are not applicable we choose
an electron energy of E = 8M eV and ﬁnd γ2
3265.
Finally, taking into account that lin/l
4, one ﬁnds
a much larger diﬀusive radiation than Cherenkov radia-
tion I D/I C
130. The number of foils and correspond-
ingly the system size can not be too large because of
absorption. On the other hands one should have enough
number of foils to treat the system as a random. For
the average photon attenuation length 0.6µm a system
size of order 10µm is reasonable. This size means ap-
proximately 40 foils. Another interesting possibility is
to generate RDR around the L3 edge of T i. For a
photon energy of ω = 453eV the refraction index of
10−3. As a spacer ma-
T i is [16] nT i = 1 + 3.0826
terial choose a light element to make reduce the total
absorption. Let consider, for example, Be. For Be at
10−3 and attenuation length
453eV nBe = 1
is 0.9117µm. The attenuation length for T i at 453eV
is 0.661µm. Analogous calculations as for the Be/Si
combination show that the geometrical optics condition
ka
1 can be satisﬁed for 100nm thick
T i foils. The resonance electron energy for a T i ﬁlling
1/2 is 9.8M eV . Taking for the electron en-
factor na
ergy E = 9.5M eV one obtains for the ratio I D/I C
24.
The number of foils could be 40
50 and the system size
10µm.

VII. DISCUSSION

4

Let us ﬁrst point out the main diﬀerences between ran-
dom and periodical systems. Gaussian averaging over
the randomness enables one to obtain a compact expres-
sion for radiation yield in contrary to the sum of compli-
cated terms in periodical case. It is easier to construct
a random system than a periodical one therefore ran-
dom systems are more convenient from practical point of
view. Consideration of pseudophoton multiple scattering
eﬀects in periodical systems remains as an open problem.
Many approximations are used when we estimate the
ratio I D/I C. Therefore we emphasize that the calcu-
lated values for I D/I C do not represent exact optimized
values. The calculations only give an impression about
a possible yield. The before mentioned ratios are very
sensitive to electron energy, refractive index, ﬁlling fac-
tor na, frequency etc. because the resonant character of
radiation. Theoretically for the resonance condition the
ratio can be very large. However this requires electrons
in the MeV range with an energy accuracy of better than
0.01M eV . As shown before, RDR for the Extreme Ul-
tra Violet and shorter wavelength regions is only possible
within a narrow bandwidth for which n(ω) > 1.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

The possibility to fundamentally generate Resonant
Diﬀusive Radiation for the short wavelength region (EUV
and soft x-rays) using a multilayer system with random
periodicity has been demonstrated theoretically. For a
resonant condition it is required that γ−2
m = 0. For
the wavelength region as considered, this is only possible
around absorption edges of some elements where ε > 1.
We demonstrated the feasibility to apply this phe-
nomenon on a practical bright source. Therefore we made
some preliminary calculations for speciﬁc materials com-
binations, comparing the RDR yield with the CR yield.
Experimental research is justiﬁed to further understand-
ing of the phenomenon. Moreover, we expect the new
high brightness photon sources can be developed, appli-
cable in x-ray microscopy or EUV lithography.

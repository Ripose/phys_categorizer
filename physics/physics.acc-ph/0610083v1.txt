In the Brazilian synchrotron light source, we observed that modulating the phase of the ac-
celerating ﬁelds at approximately twice the synchrotron frequency suppressed remarkably well a
longitudinal coupled-bunch mode of the beam driven by a higher order mode (HOM) in one of the
radiofrequency (RF) cavities. In this work, we present the results of a set of systematic measure-
ments, in single and multibunch mode, aimed at characterizing the eﬀects of RF phase modulation
on the beam. We compare those experiments with the results of tracking simulations and of a theo-
retical model in which Landau damping is the stabilizing mechanism that explains the suppression
of the longitudinal coupled bunch instability. We also measure the frequency of the stable islands
created in longitudinal phase space by phase modulation and the longitudinal beam transfer func-
tion (BTF) as a function of the modulation frequency and amplitude. The experimental results are
in good agreement with theoretical expectations.

INTRODUCTION

Studies related to the eﬀects of phase or amplitude
modulation of the accelerating RF ﬁelds in circular ac-
celerators date back to the early 1990’s when a series of
classical experiments were performed with the aim of un-
derstanding basic aspects of non-linear longitudinal beam
dynamics at low current in hadron machines [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
Apart from the fundamental interest of those experi-
ments, related to the possibility of direct observations of
non-linear phenomena such as the formation of islands in
phase space and measurement of synchrotron tune varia-
tions with amplitude, the main applications envisaged by
those works were related to issues such as lifetime lim-
itations due to rf noise, the development of super-slow
extraction techniques and the use of parametric feed-
back for multibunch instabilities. Those early works laid
the basic theoretical foundations for subsequent interest
in applying RF phase or voltage modulation to electron
storage rings used as synchrotron light sources [6, 7] as
a tool to control electron bunch density [8, 9], increase
beam lifetime [10] and reduce the amplitude or even sup-
press coupled-bunch instabilities [10, 11, 12], resulting
in relevant improvement to the performance of those ma-
chines. Some of those previous works analyzed the eﬀects
of RF phase modulation at the ﬁrst and third harmonics
of the synchrotron frequency [10, 13, 14], whereas others
(such as the present paper) [11] focus on modulation at
the second harmonic.

However, in spite of the success of the implementation
of such techniques at several laboratories, some aspects of

∗Electronic address: natalia@lnls.br

the physical mechanisms that explain the eﬀectiveness of
the reduction of the amplitude of coupled-bunch modes
(CBMs) are still not completely understood and a quan-
titative theoretical description is lacking. There is also
some diﬃculty in simulating the eﬀects of phase mod-
ulation in multibunch mode; most of the work done so
far simulates a single bunch and it is not obvious how to
infer the multibunch behavior from these results.

All experiments reported here were conducted at the
LNLS 1.37 GeV electron storage ring [15], which rou-
tinely operates to produce synchrotron radiation for
users. The original motivation for our interest in RF
phase modulation was the need to circumvent longitudi-
nal instabilities that were observed in the LNLS ring right
after the installation of a second RF cavity by the end of
2003 [16]. This cavity has a longitudinal HOM (with a
frequency of 903 MHz) which caused an intermittent or-
bit distortion that mimics the second order dispersion
function and which appeared when the beam coupled
with the HOM of the cavity exciting a large longitudi-
nal dipolar oscillation. With temperature and plunger
scans we were able to identify the longitudinal mode L1
(associated with the CBM ♯133) of the new RF cavity
as the main source of instabilities in the machine. Since
it was not possible to ﬁnd a cavity operational condition
that would be free from instabilities, an active solution in
the form of phase modulation of the RF ﬁelds at approx-
imately twice the synchrotron frequency was attempted
with success, having a noticeable impact on CBM ampli-
tudes and helping to alleviate the orbit ﬂuctuation.

In this work, we develop a theoretical model and a sim-
ulation tool to analyze the eﬀects of phase modulation
on the longitudinal beam dynamics. According to our
model, RF phase modulation enhances stability through
the increase of the incoherent frequency spread that re-

sults as the electrons populate the phase-space islands
created by the action of the modulation. In order to ver-
ify the model and simulation results, we perform a set
of systematic measurements to characterize the eﬀects
of modulation on the beam dynamics observing directly
the island tunes, the increased coherent damping and the
changes to the longitudinal electron beam distribution
caused by the modulation.

The paper is organized as follows. We begin (Section
II) with the motivation that led us to introduce phase
modulation routinely in user shifts at the LNLS storage
ring and with a report of our attempts to stabilize the
beam after the installation of the new RF cavity.
In
Section III we calculate the electron equations of motion
when subjected to phase modulation of the RF ﬁeld at
the second harmonic of the synchrotron frequency using
the hamiltonian formalism and, using the Fokker-Planck
equation, we derive the particle distribution in phase
space. Also in Section III we calculate the dynamics for
small oscillations around the stable ﬁxed points created
when modulation is turned on and, with the standard
formalism used to calculate Landau damping, we ﬁnd
the increase in the amount of damping of centroid os-
cillations related to phase modulation.
In this section
we also calculate the longitudinal beam transfer function
and the stability diagram showing that the stable area is
increased when phase modulation is turned on. In Sec-
tion IV we present results of simulations of the eﬀects of
phase modulation in single bunch and multibunch modes.
In those simulations one of the circulating bunches has
an internal structure whereas all others are treated as
macroparticles. Finally, in Section V, we compare the re-
sults of theory and simulation with experiments in which
we measure the island structure, the frequency for small
oscillations around the stable ﬁxed points created by RF
phase modulation, the increase in the amount of damp-
ing due to modulation and the longitudinal beam transfer
function (BTF), verifying the results obtained with the
theoretical model presented in Section III. Conclusions
are given in Section VI.

II. CBM STABILIZATION BY PHASE
MODULATION

The LNLS synchrotron light source is based on a
1.37 GeV electron storage ring and operates with 250 mA
of initial current in normal users shifts. A summary of
the main parameters for the Brazilian machine is shown
in Table I. At the end of 2003 the RF system of the ring
was upgraded and a new cavity was installed [16, 17].
This second RF cavity was added to the system in order
to prepare it for power demands that the future installa-
tion of insertion devices will bring about. After operation
with two cavities was initiated, the beam suﬀered from
frequent instability outbreaks during user runs.

The typical signature of the beam instability is an or-
bit ﬂuctuation measured only in the horizontal plane, as

shown in Figure 1. The distortion pattern has the same
6-fold symmetry of the storage ring and shows up in the
form of a fast transition between two states. For most of
the user run periods, small orbit ﬂuctuations with am-
plitudes of
3 µm were observed and could be detected
at the most sensitive beamlines. However, larger ampli-
tude distortions were sometimes observed as shown in
Figure 1.

±

The origin of the orbit ﬂuctuations was identiﬁed as
being related to large amplitude dipolar longitudinal os-
cillations caused by the interaction of the beam with
HOMs excited in the cavities. In fact, the second order
term of the non-linear dispersion function η1(s) was mea-
sured and has the same proﬁle observed in the beam posi-
tion monitors (BPM’s) reading and shown in Figure 1B.
When a longitudinal dipolar oscillation is present due to
the inﬂuence of a HOM, the relative energy deviation is
given by δ(t) = δ0 cos Ωst. The closed orbit distortion is
then

xǫ(s, t) = δ(t)η(s) + δ2(t)η1(s).

the synchrotron frequency) the RF master generator that
drives the RF stations.

Attempts to eliminate the instabilities by changing the
parameters of both cavities have proved to be not very
eﬀective. The search for a convenient operational point
of the cavity was performed by scanning the parameters
that can be used to control the cavity tuning (tempera-
ture, plunger position and axial deformation) and mea-
suring the corresponding HOM frequencies.

The identiﬁcation of the potentially harmful modes
was possible by comparing them with the modes mea-
sured for a similar cavity used in our injector booster
synchrotron, which had been fully characterized in the
laboratory, and by comparing the frequency shifts of the
modes with those predicted from their simulated ﬁeld
maps. The procedure adopted to analyze the eﬀect of
the HOMs is the same used for similar cavities operat-
ing at ELETTRA and ANKA [18] and consisted in the
determination of the growth rates of the coupled bunch

mode (CBM) instabilities as a function of temperature
and plunger positions. By mapping the variation of the
modes with these parameters, we determine the regions
for which the growth rates of the oscillations are below
the radiation damping rate, which for the LNLS storage
270 s−1, as
ring at nominal operating energy is 1/τrad ≈
shown in Figure 2.

The results of the HOM survey showed a comfortable
situation for the old cavity. The temperature range for
which there are no dangerous longitudinal HOMs is quite
wide. Unfortunately, the same is not true for the new
cavity. A list of some of its main longitudinal modes is
shown in Table II. TC is the critical temperature of the
mode, deﬁned as the temperature at which the frequency
of the HOM matches the frequency of the CBM oscilla-
tion. The values of QL have been measured in the new
cavity but those of Rs/Q0 are simulated values. The
main problem with the new cavity is the longitudinal
mode L1 whose critical temperature is just at the edge
of the available temperature control range but is rather
insensitive to changes of the cavity tuning parameters, as
shown in Figure 2. An attempt was made to shift that
mode using the plunger already installed in the cavity
but the extent of the plunger motion was not enough to
accomplish the task [17].

E0 = 1.37 GeV and I = 250 mA. Notice the absence of a
mode free region.

The coupled bunch mode associated with the L1 mode,

CBM ♯133, is always present in the beam spectrum ex-
cept in those regions where the growth rate of other
modes, such as CBM ♯126 associated to mode L3, are
larger. HOM mapping was useful for the identiﬁcation
of the best operation point but this point turned out to
be not good enough. As a result, an active solution in
the form of phase modulation of the RF ﬁelds at approx-
imately twice the synchrotron frequency was attempted
with remarkable success. Figure 3 shows the longitudi-
nal spectrum of the stored beam as measured by a button
pick-up. The suppression of the dipolar synchrotron side-
band of the harmonic #281 of the revolution frequency
by more than 40 dB illustrates the damping of this CBM
by RF phase modulation.

III. THEORETICAL MODEL

A. Longitudinal Hamiltonian with Phase
Modulation

 

We initially follow the standard hamiltonian analysis
for the longitudinal dynamics with phase modulation [14]
in which we expand the complete Hamiltonian near the
second harmonic resonance of the synchrotron frequency
and retain only the lower order terms. The Hamiltonian
for an electron in a bunch subjected to phase modulation
can be written as follows

H(δ, φ; t) =

+ ωs tan ¯φ[sin φ cos(Amsinωmt) + cos φ sin(Amsinωmt)]
ωs tan ¯φs

ωs cos φ cos(Amsinωmt) + ωs sin φ sin(Amsinωmt)

quency. Using the action-angle variables (J, Ψ) we make
the following transformation

The phase space coordinates of the new stable ﬁxed

and are functions of the RF phase modulation amplitude
and frequency.

The eﬀect of phase modulation is to create new regions
of stability inside the bunch, besides the original one. As
the formation of those islands depends on the modulation
amplitude and frequency, there is a continuum of forms
from one island to the appearance of three islands when

B. The Eﬀect of Radiation

All the arguments given above do not take into account
the fact that electrons in a bunch lose energy through the
emission of photons. This eﬀect causes oscillations inside
the bunch to damp, so it is important to know when this
damping can destroy the formation of islands produced
by phase modulation or modify some characteristics de-
rived using the hamiltonian formalism. The analysis that
follows uses a simple non-linear oscillation theory to cal-
culate the trajectories of a single particle under the inﬂu-
ence of phase modulation at the second harmonic of the
synchrotron frequency.

The equation of motion for a particle subjected to

phase modulation can be written as follows [19]

resonance term on the left side and the third order term
on the right side of equation (10). Non-resonant terms
in Am and tan ¯φs are discarded.

If a particle is to be captured by the parametric reso-
nance, the slowly varying coeﬁcientes a(t) and b(t) must
increase exponentially. Taking only the lower terms in a
and b in equations (13) and (14) and using this condition
we ﬁnd that, in order for phase modulation to create sta-
ble islands in the longitudinal phase space, it is necessary
that the condition α > 2γd be satisﬁed. Rewriting this
condition in terms of the phase modulation amplitude we
ﬁnd that1

and this is a limit imposed by radiation damping bellow
which no island is observed.

Changing the longitudinal phase space reference frame
to one which rotates with a frequency of ωm/2 in time we
ﬁnd that the coordinates in this new frame are related
only to the functions a(t) and b(t) and the ﬁxed points
are given by the solution of equations (13) and (14) when
˙a = ˙b = 0. Rewriting a = √2r cos θ and b = √2r sin θ we

C. Dynamics of Small Oscillations Around the
Fixed Points

We now consider the dynamics of particle oscillations
in the vicinity of the stable ﬁxed points (SFPs) in or-
der to derive two important properties of the electron
motion:
the equilibrium density distribution close to
the SFPs and the frequency of synchrotron oscillations
around those points (also known as the island tune), in-
cluding its dependence on the oscillation amplitude. This
is an important quantity since it describes the frequency
of incoherent oscillation of the particles inside the island
when subjected to a longitudinal kick and its dependence
on oscillation amplitude is intimately related to the ef-
fectiveness of phase modulation as a damping mechanism
for coherent synchrotron oscillations.

We start by expanding equation (6) around a ﬁxed

ble ﬁxed point, we must solve the Fokker-Planck equa-
tion, using H ′ from equation (21) and taking into ac-
count the radiation damping (γd) and quantum excita-
tion (κ = σ2
δ γd) terms. When all forces are balanced the
solution of the Fokker-Planck equation is a bi-gaussian

In other words, particles close to the stable ﬁxed points
are subjected to an eﬀective harmonic potential and we
estimate the steady-state phase space proﬁle of the elec-
tron beam under phase modulation (when radiation ex-
citation and damping are balanced) by a bi-gaussian dis-
tribution.

that phase modulation creates a spread in the frequency
distribution inside the bunch thus increasing the amount
of Landau damping [22]. In this case we are only inter-
ested in the damping of synchrotron oscillations of the
bunch centroid which are produced by the coupling be-
tween the synchrotron motion and a longitudinal HOM
of the RF cavity. We therefore proceed to calculate the
response of the beam centroid motion to an external har-
monic perturbation when phase modulation is on.

Suppose the particles in a bunch have a distribution
Ψ(r) in phase space. In case the beam is phase modu-
lated the distribution can be approximated, in the rotat-
ing reference frame, by three gaussian functions each one

or the side islands formed when the phase modulation
is turned on, r is a radial coordinate in the longitudinal

Considering that, when an external perturbation with

As the measurements are performed in the laboratory
reference frame it is necessary to transpose equation (38)
to this reference frame. To do this, note that in the
lab frame the frequency of the lateral islands appears
as a lower sideband of half of the modulation frequency
[Appendix B] so that we have two diﬀerent frequency
responses: ωm/2+ωc for the central island and ωm/2
ωi
for the side islands, as shown in Figure 5. It is interesting
to observe that the eﬀect of phase modulation is to create
a second peak, related to the island frequency and also
an intermediary phase jump in the BTF, these features
are very diﬀerent from the conventional picture expected
when measuring the BTF of an electron beam without
phase modulation.

The spread in incoherent frequencies in the bunch
causes it to strongly damp coherent oscillations excited
by a harmonic driving force. This force can be an ex-
ternal excitation or wake ﬁeld which interacts with the
electron beam [22]. If we consider a short bunch which

and the stability condition is so that: Im(Ω) < 0.

Therefore, using equations (36) and (44) we can deﬁne
the stability diagram for coherent centroid oscillations in
the following way

and shown in Figure 6, where H(x) is a step function.

frequency
for the bunch in the LNLS electron storage ring is

160 Hz and the total damping, including the
coh ≈
radiation damping time, related to this frequency disper-
3 ms. Suppose half of the particles are in
sion is τnat ≈
the central island, so that Nc = 1/2, and the amplitude
and frequency of the modulation are 50 mrad and 50 kHz
respectively. The frequency spread and the new damping
time due to phase modulation, given by equations (40)
and (41), are ∆ωmod = 490 Hz and τmod = 2.2 ms. This
damping time is smaller than the estimated growth time
for the L1 instability, which is 3.3 ms 2. So, using the
phase modulation we are able to set the beam well below
the stability boundary and eﬀectively damp this coupled
bunch mode.

So far we have only estimated the eﬀects of phase mod-
ulation on beam stability. We are going now to calculate
the implications of the increase in frequency spread due
to modulation on the beam when it is subjected to its
own ﬁelds.

2 This value for the mode growth time is for a temperature of
40 oC, an accelerating voltage of 500 kV and a total stored cur-
rent of 250 mA.

where ˆf (ω) and ˆg(ω) are the real and imaginary parts of
the BTF I(Ω) (equation 37).

Figure 7 shows the stability diagram for a bunch under
phase modulation (black full line) and in normal condi-
tions (dashed line). Note that, when phase modulation
is turned on, the stable area is increased and that a new
region, inside the loop, is formed. This new region is also
unstable, as shown by the red line which is calculated
for positive imaginary coherent frequency shift, what vi-
olates the stability criterion. The dots shown in Figure 7
represent various operation points depending on the op-
erating temperature of the new cavity. The green mark,
for example, indicates the point for 50 oC that is unstable
under normal operation conditions and becomes stable if
phase modulation is turned on.

IV. SIMULATION

In order to gain some insight into the behavior of the
bunches under phase modulation and verify the prop-
erties derived from the theoretical model outlined above,
we developed a longitudinal dynamics simulation code in-
cluding beam loading eﬀects and the presence of the lon-
gitudinal HOMs as well as phase modulation. The track-
ing code calculates the trajectories of individual particles

in longitudinal phase space and derives the corresponding
averaged quantities representing the motion of the bunch
centroid as well as a projected (time averaged) longitu-
dinal charge density proﬁle appropriate for comparison
with experimental results.

Even though the application of the code to the single
bunch case is relatively straightforward, the calculations
for the multibunch case are much more time consuming,
since at the LNLS storage ring we routinely operate with
all 148 bunches ﬁlled (no gaps in the bunch train). In or-
der to circumvent that diﬃculty, we use a hybrid simula-
b147) as
tion, in which we treat the ﬁrst 147 bunches (b1 −
macro-particles (no internal structure) whereas the last
bunch (b0) is composed of 1000 individual macroparti-
cles. Note that although each one of the 147 bunches
without internal structure is represented basically by a
single point in phase space (rather than by a distribu-
tion), an eﬀective bunch length (representing the projec-
tion of the phase space bunch distribution on the time
axis) is also attributed to those bunches when calculating
the excitation of the wake ﬁelds. In fact, as the particles
inside b0 are redistributed in phase space as a result of
phase modulation and interactions with the environment,
its bunch length is also changed and that value of bunch
length is then transferred to all non-structured bunches
b147). In this way one important aspect of the inter-
(b1 −
nal bunch structure is shared by all bunches. Clearly, this
procedure cannot take into account all properties related
to the internal motion of the bunches and describe their
eﬀect on the stabilization of the motion. However, we
shall see in the following sections, that such simulations
give additional indication that the increase in incoherent
frequency spread inside the bunches is indeed the main
stabilizing mechanism provided by phase modulation.

A. Equations of Motion

The model used in the simulation considers that ev-
ery possible bunch is ﬁlled with electrons and each one
of those bunches, except one, is represented by a single
macroparticle. The bunches pass periodically through
the accelerating cavities and contribute to the cumula-
tive build-up of the induced ﬁelds. The eﬀect of the beam
loading is also taken into account in the calculation of the
trajectories of the individual electrons of the structured
bunch.

In order to calculate the trajectories of these macropar-
ticles in the longitudinal phase space, we use the following
equations:

τb,n = τb,n−1 −
δb,n = (1

−

αδb,n−1T0,

2γdT0)δb,n−1 +

(eVtot −
E

U0)

,

with

Vtot = Vrf + Vbl

where τ and δ are the time displacement and energy de-
viation of the macroparticle related to the reference syn-
chronous particle, b is the index of the bunch and n is the
number of turns, T0 is the revolution period, Vrf is the
gap voltage and Vbl is the energy drained by the beam
loading eﬀect, which takes into account the beam loading
of the fundamental mode and of the longitudinal mode
(L1). In order to simulate each particle in the structured
bunch (b0), we use the same equations and also consider
radiation excitation.

The phase modulation is included in the calculation of

the rf voltage as follows

Vrf = V0 sin(φs −

ωrf τb,n + Am sin(ωmt))

(49)

were V0 is the peak voltage, φs the synchronous phase,
ωrf the angular RF frequency, Am the modulation am-
plitude and ωm the modulation frequency which we set
near the synchrotron second harmonic (ωm = 2ωs + δω).
The beam loading eﬀect is introduced in the tracking

simulation using the following expressions:

where ωres is the angular frequency and k is the loss

the rms bunch length.

B. Single Bunch Simulations

Using the simulation code described above, we calcu-
late the phase space distribution of the particles in a
single bunch of 1000 macroparticles under phase modu-
lation. Figure 8 shows the phase space with two diﬀerent
modulation frequencies and also without phase modu-
lation. The phase space patterns observed are in good

lar spectral line produced by phase modulation (Figure
3) that we typically observe in multibunch mode. Note
that in this single bunch simulation the eﬀects of an in-
creased incoherent frequency spread are fully taken into
account.

C. Multibunch Simulations

±

For the multibunch case, we simulate the dipolar os-
cillation excited by the longitudinal HOM of the cavities
(Figure 11A). The simulations are performed considering
a total stored current of 200 mA. A comparison between
two diﬀerent multibunch tracking simulations shows that
the change in the amplitude of the dipolar coherent syn-
chrotron oscillation when the L1 mode is turned on is
greater than 100 dB, demonstrating the excitation of
dipolar oscillations in the beam, as observed during users
shifts. We could also observe a good agreement between
the value of the growth time of the L1 mode given by
theory (4 ms) and simulation (4.5

0.5 ms).

Figures 11A and B show results of multibunch simu-
lations without phase modulation for two diﬀerent equi-
librium bunch lengths. We see that even if the bunch
length in increased by a factor of 3 (which is larger than
the increase observed in multibunch simulations when
phase modulation is applied) there is basically no damp-
ing of the coherent oscillations excited by the L1 HOM.
In other words, the mere dilution of the beam bunches is
not enough to explain the coherent damping eﬃciency of
phase modulation: the internal rearrangement of longitu-
dinal phase space and corresponding increased frequency
spread is a fundamental ingredient, as could be seen in
the single bunch simulations above.

Finally, we simulate a multibunch case with phase
modulation, which is shown in Figure 11C. Now we ob-
serve a damping of the CBM amplitude by a factor 5,
which is much smaller than what is observed in the sin-
gle bunch simulations as well as in experiments. This
is a result of the hybrid character of our simulation, in
which only one out of 148 bunches has an internal struc-
ture (and corresponding frequency spread), although all

In the two last ﬁgures it is possible to
observe the formation of three and two islands respectively,
as predicted by the theory.

agreement with the ones calculated using the Hamilto-
nian (6) and shown in Figure 4. In particular, the posi-
tion of the islands center given by simulation corresponds
to the action amplitudes JSF P =0.122 and 0.047 for 3 and
2 islands respectively, as shown in Figure 8. This is in
very good agreement with the theoretical values 0.042
and 0.130 for the cases with 3 and 2 islands, obtained
from (8) using the eﬀective modulation amplitude (Aef f
m ).
We also calculate the time-averaged longitudinal par-
ticle distribution proﬁles in time domain, which is a his-
togram of the particles position in time for a period much
longer than the synchrotron one. This result simulates
the proﬁle that would be seen when measuring the signal
from a button pickup, and is shown in Figure 9.

Finally we simulate the damping of a coherent dipolar
oscillation by phase modulation. The dipolar oscillation
of a high current single bunch (30 mA) is excited by the
L1 HOM and, when phase modulation is turned on, the
oscillation amplitude is reduced by a factor 30 (Figure
10), which corresponds approximately to an attenuation
of 30 dB. This is similar to the 40 dB damping of the dipo-

11

FIG. 12: General layout of the experimental setup. The solid
line correspond to the experimental setup used to measure
the bunch shape and the beam spectrum while the dashed
line corresponds to the additional setup used to measure the
damping time for coherent synchrotron oscillations.

A. Experimental Setup

The basic idea of the experiments is to excite the beam
via phase modulation of the RF ﬁelds and observe its re-
sponse as a function of a controlled parameter such as
modulation amplitude and frequency. To modulate the
phase of the accelerating ﬁelds, we use a voltage driven
phase shifter attached to the output of the RF genera-
tor responsible for producing the master RF signal. This
phase shifter is controlled by a signal from another gener-
ator that creates a modulation with a chosen frequency.
The full experimental setup is shown in Figure 12.

The shape of the bunch is measured by a wideband
oscilloscope (HP 54750A, 20 GHz) and the amplitude
of the dipolar synchrotron sideband is observed using a
spectrum analyzer (HP8560) both receiving the signal
from a button pickup in the ring.
In the multibunch
case we choose to observe the synchrotron line around
harmonic ♯281 of the revolution frequency that is close
to the frequency of the L1 longitudinal HOM from the
cavity.

We also measure the damping time for synchrotron
oscillation of the centroid of a single bunch by com-
paring the phase between the master RF signal to the
476.066 MHz component of the longitudinal beam signal
and observe the signal in a high sampling rate oscillo-
scope (TDS684B). To create a longitudinal kick we use a
function generator that produces a step function with a
given amplitude and acts on a phase shifter in series with
the one used to modulate the RF wave. The additional
setup required to measure the damping time is shown by
the dashed lines in Figure 12.

FIG. 11: Simulation of the centroid oscillation of a longitu-
dinal CBM driven by an RF cavity HOM: (A) without phase
modulation, (B) without phase modulation and three times
the natural bunch length and (C) with phase modulation.The
ﬁgure shows one of each 6 bunches, as it would be seen by a
streak camera.

bunches share the common increased bunch length. The
damping of the structured bunch b0 weakens the coupling
between the electron beam and the HOM reducing the
amplitude of the CBM coherent oscillation.

V. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS

In Sections III and IV we calculate and simulate some
characteristics of the longitudinal beam dynamics with
RF phase modulation on the second harmonic of the syn-
chrotron frequency. In this section we perform an exper-
imental veriﬁcation of the predictions made. The details
of the experimental setup and the results obtained are
shown in the following parts.

FIG. 13: Beam proﬁle observed in an oscilloscope for a gap
voltage of 460 kV.

B. Experimental Results and Comparison with
Theory

In this section we present a comparison between the
predictions of the theoretical model and measurements.
This analysis is done in the following order: island for-
mation as a function of modulation frequency, damping
time of the centroid synchrotron motion as a function
of modulation frequency and amplitude, measurement of
island tune and its behavior as a function of modulation
amplitude and frequency, and measurement of the BTF.

1.

Island Formation

The time-averaged longitudinal bunch proﬁle predicted
by our single bunch simulation, Figure 9, is compared
with the experimental results of the signal from a button
pickup observed on an oscilloscope and shown in Figure
13. We observe that, for modulation frequencies ωm <
ǫ/2), the proﬁle corresponds to the case with three
ωs(2
ǫ/2), only two
stable regions whereas, when ωm > ωs(2
stable regions are created. This is an indirect way to
observe the bunch internal structure created by phase
modulation. The same result has already been obtained
directly in other laboratories [11] using a streak camera
to observe the beamlets.

FIG. 14: Example of a measurement of the synchrotron damp-
ing time.

Figure 15 is the damping time ratio for a single bunch
with phase modulation turned on and oﬀ.

The results presented in Figure 14 are not the ones ob-
served directly on the oscilloscope. When performing this
measurement we observe that the phase of the RF compo-
nent of the beam oscillates not only with the synchrotron
frequency but also with multiples and sub-multiples of
the modulation frequency. The raw data acquired is ﬁl-
tered and those frequencies removed from the spectrum
in order to leave just a band of frequencies around the
dipolar frequency of centroid oscillations, which allows
us to determine the damping time of coherent dipolar
oscillations.

A set of measurements of damping time versus modu-
lation frequency is shown in Figure 15 and it is possible
to observe that phase modulation is eﬀective only for a
narrow band of frequencies approximately 400 Hz wide.
For frequencies above 50.2 kHz the eﬀect no longer exists,
which agrees with the theoretical model used to describe
the damping mechanism. This model predicts that, for
frequencies above 50.3 kHz (fm = (2+ǫ/2)fs), the islands
collapse into one so that there is no increase in damping
time.

Using equation (41), we can estimate the value for the
damping time increase due to phase modulation and Fig-
ure 15 shows good agreement between theory and exper-
imental data. The error bars are relatively large due to
the diﬃculties of measuring the damping time.

3. Measurement of the Island Tune

2. Longitudinal Damping Time

The measurements of the damping of coherent syn-
chrotron oscillations are performed using a function gen-
erator and a phase shifter to apply a longitudinal kick
to the beam. Using the signal from a button pick-up, we
measure the phase of the RF component of the beam with
respect to the master RF signal. Figure 14 is an example
of the measurement for a single bunch with 4.3 mA and

An FFT of the damping time measurement data also
shows a lower sideband of the line corresponding to half
of the modulation frequency. This sideband, shown in
Figure 16, correspond to the island tune [Appendix B].
Figures 17 and 18 show the measured dependence of the
island frequency with modulation parameters and the

4. Measurement of the BTF

The experimental setup used to measure the BTF is
shown in Figure 19. We use a network analyzer to excite
a dipolar oscillation on a low current single bunch and
measure the beam response in amplitude and phase using
a button pickup.

The results for a set of measurements with phase mod-
ulation turned on and oﬀ are shown in Figures 20 and 21
respectively. The dots are the experimental data and the
full line comes from the theoretical model. The result
of those measurements indicates that the phase modu-
lation produces an increase in frequency spread within
the bunch since the width in the amplitude response it
related to this spread.

Figure 22 shows the stability diagram for the same set
of measurements above (Figures 20 and 21) and the corre-
sponding theoretical curves. The green dots and red line
correspond to the case without modulation, whereas the
black dots and blue line correspond to a phase modula-
tion amplitude of 35 mrad and frequency of 51 kHz. Note
that the stable area is eﬀectively increased when phase
modulation is turned on and also that some features, such
as the loop predicted by the model, are present in the ex-
perimental data.

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We have shown experimental and theoretical evidence
that, when RF phase modulation on the second harmonic
of the synchrotron frequency is used, the available sta-
ble area to the electron beam is eﬀectively increased and
that the mechanism responsible for this enhancement in
stability is an increase in the incoherent frequency spread
which, via Landau damping, helps to alleviate unstable
CBMs. We also simulate and calculate the island forma-
tion and perform measurements that indicate that these
structures are indeed formed in the longitudinal phase
space.

Our simulations also indicate that the lengthening of

The dots correspond to data points and the full red line to

the bunches which results from phase modulation (an
eﬀect which has already been used at several laboratories
as a tool to increase Touschek lifetime of intense bunches)
cannot explain by itself the stabilization of CBMs that is
observed when phase modulation is applied. In fact, only
when bunches with internal structure (and corresponding
frequency spread) are included in the simulations do we
observe the intense damping of CBMs that is obtained in
experiments.

Finally, the model developed to describe the BTF mea-
surements presents all interesting features of the exper-
imental results, namely the double peaks and a second
phase jump (which shows up as the loop of the stability

diagram), although the island population still remains
as a free parameter. We hope to be able to access this
quantity in the future by using a streak camera.

We have been using RF phase modulation since 2004
to stabilize the electron beam of the LNLS storage ring.
Although in the Brazilian machine the overall lifetime
increase (we observed a lifetime increase of 30 %) was
not as great as the one observed in other laboratories
[9, 10, 11] the orbit ﬂuctuation caused by the coupling of
the beam with a HOM of the RF cavities was successfully
suppressed improving the beam quality for users.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

We would like to express deep gratitude to the LNLS
RF and diagnostics group whose support were crucial for
the successful completion of this work. This work was
completed with the support of FAPESP (Funda¸c˜ao de
Apoio a Pesquisa do Estado de S˜ao Paulo).

APPENDIX B: CALCULATION OF THE ISLAND
FREQUENCY IN THE LABORATORY
REFERENCE FRAME

In the rotating reference frame the motion of the par-

ticles in the islands can be described by

φ′ = r0 cos(ω′t) + x0

and δ′ =

r0 sin(ω′t)

(B1)

−

where r0 is the amplitude of the oscillations around the
stable ﬁxed point, x0 is the stable ﬁxed point coordinate
in phase space and ω′ = √AB is either the lateral island
frequency or the central island frequency. To go from
the rotating frame (which rotates clockwise with respect
to the lab frame) to the laboratory reference frame, it is

To understand this set of equations we have ﬁrst to know
wether particles in the islands rotate clockwise or coun-
terclockwise. Taking the harmonic part of the Hamil-
tonian (21) expanded around each stable ﬁxed point we
ﬁnd that

dφ′

= Aδ′

and

= Bφ′

(B6)

so that if A > 0 and B > 0 the particles rotate clockwise
and if A < 0 and B < 0 the particles rotate counterclock-
wise.

Calculating the coeﬃcients A and B for our parame-
ters, we ﬁnd that particles in the central island rotates
clockwise and particles in the lateral islands rotate coun-
terclockwise. Using this result we can write the particles
equations in the lab reference frame

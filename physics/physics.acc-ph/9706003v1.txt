Ultimate luminosities and energies of
photon colliders ∗

Valery Telnov
Institute of Nuclear Physics, 630090, Novosibirsk, Russia

Abstract

A photon collider luminosity and its energy are determined by the parameters of
an electron-electron linear collider (energy, power, beam emittances) and collision
eﬀects. The main collision eﬀect is the coherent e+e− pair creation. At low energies
(2E< 0.5–1 TeV) this process is suppressed due to repulsion of electron beams. In
this region Lγγ(z > 0.65)
1034 is suﬃcient). At
higher energies the limited average beam power and coherent pair creation restrict
the maximum energy of photon colliders (with suﬃcient luminosity) at Ecm ∼
5 TeV. Obtaining high luminosities requires the development of new methods of
production beams with low emittances such as a laser cooling.

1 Introduction

Linear colliders oﬀer the unique opportunities to study γγ, γe interactions. Using the
laser backscattering method one can obtain γγ and γe colliding beams with an energy
and luminosity comparable to that in e+e− collisions or even higher (due to the absence
of some beam collision eﬀects). This can be done with a relatively small incremental
cost. The expected physics in these collisions is very rich and complementary to that in
e+e− collisions. Some characteristic examples are:

•

a γγ collider provides the unique opportunities to measure the two-photon decay
width of the Higgs boson, and to search for relatively heavy Higgs states in the
extended Higgs models such as MSSM;

•

a γγ collider is an outstanding W factory, with a W W pair production cross section
by a factor of 10–20 larger than that in e+e− and with a potential of producing

107 W ’s per year, allowing a precision study of the anomalous gauge boson
interactions;

a γγ, γe collider is a remarkable tool for searching for new charged particles, such
as supersymmetric particles, leptoquarks, excited states of electrons, etc., as in
γγ, γe collisions they are produced with cross sections larger than those in e+e−
collisions;

Charged sypersymmetric particles with massws higher than the beam energy could
be produced with a γe collider.

Two electron beams after the ﬁnal focus system are traveling toward the interaction
point (IP). At a distance of about 1 cm upstream from the IP, at a conversion point
(CP), the laser beam is focused and Compton backscattered by the electrons, resulting
in the high energy beam of photons. With reasonable laser parameters one can “convert”
most of electrons to high energy photons. The photon beam follows the original electron
direction of motion with a small angular spread of order 1/γ, arriving at the IP in a
tight focus, where it collides with a similar opposing high energy photon beam or with
an electron beam. The photon spot size at the IP may be almost equal to that of
electrons at IP and therefore the luminosity of γγ, γe collisions will be of the same order
as the “geometric” luminosity of basic ee beams.

The energy spectrum of photons after the Compton scattering for various polarization
of electrons and laser photons is shown in ﬁg. 2. At the optimum laser wave length (below
the threshold of e+e− pair creation), the maximum energy of scattered photons is about
82% of the initial electron energy. Photons in the high energy part of spectrum can
have high degree of polarization. This part of spectrum is most valuable for experiment.
Below we will deal mainly with γγ luminosity produced by high energy photons.

Here we will not consider the general features of photon colliders, they are discribed

in papers[2]–[5] and Proceedings of the Berkeley Workshop [6].

Preliminary studies show that the photon colliders with an energy 2E

500 GeV and
1033cm−2s−1 (at z = Wγγ/2E > 0.7 ) can be built [6, 1, 9].

However, physicists will be happy to have larger luminosity to study details of some
Higgs. It is also of interest to investigate main properties
processes, for example γγ
of the photon colliders at higher energy. We know that e+e− linear colliders at an energy
above 1–2 TeV have serious problems. Is it easier to explore this region with a photon
collider?

The present paper is focused mainly on the study of limitations on the energy and lu-
minosity of photon colliders. We understand that linear colliders will be built not sooner
than in one decade and will work another one–two decades. Therefore in discussions we

will not conﬁne ourselves by the present achievements and technologies. This concerns
laser parameters (for high energy photon collider a free electron laser is needed) and
emittances of electron beams. Although FELs with close parameters do not exist, but
there are projects of such lasers. The way to very low emittances (laser cooling) was
discussed at the ﬁrst ITP symposium [10].

In the later paper it was also found how to overcome the problem of nonlinear eﬀects
in the conversion region which leads to the linear growth of the laser ﬂash energy with
the increase in the electron beam energy. In the proposed method of ‘stretching’ the
conversion region the required laser ﬂash energy does not grow at all with energy.

2 Requirements to γγ luminosity

Cross sections of the charged particle production in γγ collisions are somewhat higher
than those in e+e− collisions. At E > Mc2 the ratio of cross sections are the following:

To have the same statistics (but complementary physics) in γγ collisions the lumi-

nosity can be smaller than that in e+e− collisions by a factor of 5.

Cross sections decrease usually as 1/S (S = E2

cm), therefore the luminosity should
grow proportionally to S. A reasonable scaling for the required γγ luminosity (in the
high energy peak of the luminosity distribution) at γγ collider is

problem. The scaling (1) will be used for estimation of the maximum energy of photon
colliders.

The average number of hadron events/per bunch crossing is about one at Lγγ(z >
0.65) = 1034 cm−2s−1 and at the typical collision rate 5 kHz. In this paper, we are inter-
ested mainly by the luminosity in the high energy part of luminosity spectrum. However,
in the scheme without deﬂection of used electron beams the total γγ luminosity is larger
than the ‘useful’ Lγγ(z > 0.65) by a factor 5–10 due to collisions of low energy Compton
photons and beamstrahlung photons. This low energy collisions increase background by
1035, this leads to about
a factor 2–3. At Ecm = 5 TeV with required Lγγ(z > 0.65)
∼
30 (eﬀectively) high energy γγ
hadron events per bunch crossing. Similar number of
hadronic events/collision is expected at LHC. However, there is important an diﬀerence
between pp and γγ colliders: in the case of an interesting event (high Pt jets and leptons)
the total energy of ﬁnal products at photon colliders is equal to Ecm, while at proton
colliders it is only about (1/6)Ecm. The ratio of the signal to background at photon
colliders is better by a factor 6 at the same number of hadronic events per crossing.
Moreover, during the reconstruction of an interesting event one can subtract smooth
hadronic background and only its ﬂuctuations are important which are proportional to
√L. It means that for L
E2 (and ﬁxed collision rate) the ratio of signal to background
∝
is almost constant (decreases only logarithmically).

→

The above arguments shows that the problem of hadronic background is not dramatic
for photon colliders. Of course, some increase in the collision rate with an increase in the
luminosity will be useful. We will see that due to collision eﬀects the optimum number
of particles in one bunch should decrease with energy, that naturally leads to an increase
in the collision rate.

3 Collision eﬀects. Coherent pair creation.

There are two basic collision schemes [5]:

Scheme A (“without deﬂection”). There is no magnetic deﬂection of the spent elec-
trons and all particles after the conversion region travel to the IP. The conversion point
may be situated very close to the IP.

Scheme B (“with deﬂection”). After the conversion region particles pass through a
region with a transverse magnetic ﬁeld where electrons are swept aside. Thereby, one
can achieve a more or less pure γγ or γe collisions.

During beam collision, photons are inﬂuenced by the ﬁeld of the opposing electron
beam. One of the important processes in this ﬁeld is a conversion of photons into e+e−
pairs (coherent pair creation)[7]. Under a certain conditions, the conversion length is
shorter than the length of interaction region (

σz) and γγ luminosity is suppressed.

4 Estimation of ultimate γγ luminosity

Let us ﬁnd now limits posed on the luminosity due to coherent pair creation for diﬀerent
collision schemes.

There are three ways to avoid this eﬀect (i.e. to keep Υ

1) to use ﬂat beams;
2) to deﬂect the electron beam after conversion at a suﬃciently large distance (x0 for

E = E0) from the interaction point(IP);

3) under certain conditions (low beam energy, long bunches) Υ < Υm at the IP due

to the repulsion of electron beams [8].

Let us consider at ﬁrst requirements to the beam sizes in the case 1.

In fact, at low enough energy this eﬀect allows to use even inﬁnitely narrow electron
beams with any reasonable number of particles in the bunch and the minimum photon
spot size is b/γ, where b should be taken as small as possible. At high energies this
eﬀect also works but the number of particles in the bunch should be below some number
dependent of the energy (eq.17).

5 Scheme with magnetic deﬂection

Using the magnetic ﬁeld Be between the conversion and interaction regions one can sweep
out electrons from the interaction point at some distance x0 suﬃcient for the suppression
of coherent pair creation, i.e. to satisfy condition Υ < Υm given by eq.6. This distance
x0 is approximately equalto σx given by eq.7. The required distance b is found from

This number is notably smaller than that in the scheme without deﬂection eq(20).
The luminosity is proportional to Be and one can take larger ﬁeld values but it poses some
technical problems. One should also remember that in the transverse magnetic ﬁeld, the
soft background particles produced in the forward direction (mainly e+e− pairs) get a
kick, begin to spiral in the detector ﬁeld and to avoid backgrounds the radius of the
vacuum pipe should exceed r = 2bB⊥/Bk.

Considering the scheme with deﬂection we did not consider the ﬁeld created by the
produced e+e− pairs. These particles are closer to the beam axis than the deﬂected
beam and their ﬁeld can even exceed the ﬁeld of the opposing electron beam. Therefore,
our optimization of pair creation overestimates the luminosity. We will see results of
simulation in next sections.

6 Simulation

6.1 Assumptions

We have seen that the picture of collisions is very complicated. It is easier to get the
result by simulation. The simulation code used in this work [5] includes all important
processes. In the present study, the beams are collided in very ultimate conditions: very
small beam sizes, high energies, too many beamstrahlung photons. In order to avoid the
time consumption problem only one simpliﬁcation was done: charged particles emitted
the beamstrahlung photons during the beam collision but these photons were excluded
from further consideration. It was assumed that:

a) the thickness of the laser target is equal to one collision length (k = 1
b) electrons and laser photons are polarized and 2Pcλe =

Fig. 3 shows γγ luminosity as a function of σx at TESLA and NLC for the beam energy
range 0.25–4 TeV. On the righthand graphs, the number of particles was decreased by
a factor 10, while the collision rate was increased by the same factor. The distance
b = 0.2 + 0.1E[TeV] cm . We see on the left-hand side graphs that for ‘nominal’ numbers
1/σx due to
of particles in the beams the luminosity does not follow the dependence L

eq(12).

In ﬁg. 4 we can see the dependence of the luminosity both on N and σz in the case
where beams are round and the conversion region is situated as close as possible: b =
3σz + 0.04E[TeV] cm . The total beam power is 15E[TeV] MW. Looking to this pictures
one can make many own observations which are clear after our theoretical consideration.

deﬂection does not help to reach ultimate luminosities, in ‘practical‘ cases (where the
luminosity is far from the limit) the magnetic deﬂection helps to decrease the low energy
γγ luminosity without degradation of the high energy part.

Comparing our luminosity scaling law (eq.1) with the results of the simulation we see
that the required luminosity can be reached at least up to 2E = 4 TeV with any (up to
1010) number of particles in the bunch. Note that in our examples the collision rate is
3
f =10 kHz(1010/N). The higher f is good for the experiment but makes some problems
for the required average laser power. It seems that f=10–30 kHz is still acceptable. With
1010 one can reach at 2E=5 TeV even a few times higher luminosity than that it

is ‘required’. The main problem here is connected with attainable beam emittances.

7 Beam emittances

Only short remark. The normalized emittances which are written in the current projects
[1] do not allow to follow the scaling low above 2E = 1 TeV. An increase in luminosity at
low energies or motion towards high energies requires serious R&D work on low emittance
electron beams. One new suggestion was reported at the ITP Workshops[10]. This is
laser cooling which allows to cool beams down to values necessary for all parameters of
photon colliders considered here.

mode. The number of problems grows exponentially: acceleration gradient, very small
beam sizes, radiation, pair creation. The reason is common for all mode of operation:

∼

1) the required luminosity is proportional to E2;
2) energetic problem, because beams are used only once (but namely this feature

makes possible to consider photon colliders).

Linear colliders are perfect for 2E = 0.1 – 2 TeV and we have to use their potential

with highest eﬃciency.

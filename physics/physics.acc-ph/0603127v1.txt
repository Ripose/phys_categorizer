(Dated: August 11, 2013)

An electrostatic lens with three focusing elements in an alternating-gradient conﬁguration is used
to focus a fountain of cesium atoms in their ground (strong-ﬁeld-seeking) state. The lens electrodes
are shaped to produce only sextupole plus dipole equipotentials which avoids adding the unnecessary
nonlinear forces present in cylindrical lenses. Defocusing between lenses is greatly reduced by having
all of the main electric ﬁelds point in the same direction and be of nearly equal magnitude. The
addition of the third lens gave us better control of the focusing strength in the two transverse
planes and allowed focusing of the beam to half the image size in both planes. The beam envelope
was calculated for lens voltages selected to produced speciﬁc focusing properties. The calculations,
starting from ﬁrst principles, were compared with measured beam sizes and found to be in good
agreement. Application to fountain experiments, atomic clocks, and focusing polar molecules in
strong-ﬁeld-seeking states is discussed.

INTRODUCTION

cesium atoms (in one dimension).

The force exerted by a static electric ﬁeld gradient
on a beam of slow neutral atoms can produce useful
focusing[1]. This force arises from the interaction of the
electric ﬁeld gradient with the induced electric dipole mo-
ment of the atom. Because no external magnetic ﬁelds
are introduced, electric ﬁeld gradient focusing is suitable
for magnetic-ﬁeld sensitive experiments such as atomic
fountain clocks and electron electric dipole moment ex-
periments.

In cesium fountain atomic clocks, focusing could be
used to reduce the cesium-cesium scattering. Cesium-
cesium scattering produces a density-dependent fre-
quency shift[2, 3, 4] and has been listed as the largest
contribution to the uncertainty in the NIST-F1 fountain
clock[5]. Although all of the cesium atoms that enter the
clock interaction region contribute to the cesium-cesium
scattering frequency shift, only the small fraction of the
atoms return to exit the interaction region and contribute
to the signal. In NIST-F1 about 90 percent of the atoms
have been reported lost [5]. If the non-returning atoms
are removed before they enter the interaction region, the
atoms would not contribute to the cesium-cesium scat-
tering and the systematic would be reduced.

The unwanted atoms could be removed by having a set
of electrostatic lenses expand the cesium fountain beam,
thereby making it into a nearly parallel beam, and then
using a collimator to remove all but the center portion
of the beam. The atoms that contribute to the signal
would be in the center of the beam and pass through
the collimator. Section V B and especially Fig.9 show
examples of focusing to produce nearly parallel beams of

ment, University California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720.

Controlling the beam proﬁle by focusing lenses and
collimator will also greatly reduce the dependence of the
beam trajectory on variations in source position, source
size, and initial beam divergence. Such variations will
change the number of atoms that pass through the inter-
action region, but will have little inﬂuence on the beam
trajectory. With more stable beam trajectories it may
be possible to boost the beam intensity by using a trap
as the atom source, rather than a molasses.

Fountain experiments to search for an electron elec-
tric dipole moment or to measure polarizability[6] require
a region of strong electric ﬁeld. The atoms defocus as
they enter and exit the ﬁeld[7], robbing the experiment
of needed intensity. A set of lens elements can largely
compensate for the defocusing, maintaining beam inten-
sity.

Electric ﬁeld gradient focusing is also useful in foun-
tains of alkali atoms containing more than one magnetic
substate (mF ). The forces produced, by an electric ﬁeld
gradient, on alkali atom and other J ≤ 1/2 ground state
atoms are essentially independent of the magnetic quan-
tum number, mF [8]. Magnetic ﬁeld gradients produce
forces that are strongly dependent on the magnetic sub-
state and thus focus each mF state diﬀerently.

For polar molecules, electric ﬁeld gradient focusing
is the standard method for focusing molecular beams,
including thermal beams and jet-source beams. Polar
molecules typically have large electric dipole moments
and very small magnetic dipole moments The focusing
lens triplet described in this paper is suitable for fo-
cusing polar molecules in strong-ﬁeld-seeking states and
also polar molecules in some weak-ﬁeld-seeking states.
Molecules such as chlorobenzene and cesium ﬂuoride have
small rotational constants and large electric dipole mo-
ments. This makes all of their low-lying rotational states
strong-ﬁeld seeking in even a modest electric ﬁeld. Eﬃ-
cient focusing of these molecules should be possible with
our lens design.

In the remainder of the paper we discuss alternating
gradient focusing (Section II), lens design and the choice
of electric multipole moments for linear focusing of atoms
and molecules (Section III), beam trajectory calculations
(Section IV) and ﬁnally, in Section V, the construction
and operation of a triplet lens in a cesium fountain and
comparison between calculation and measurement for dif-
ferent focusing conditions.

The force on the atom in an electric ﬁeld gradient is:

dipole polarizability[6].

x + E2

y + E2

The force from the electric ﬁeld gradient on ground
state atoms is towards the stronger ﬁeld (strong-ﬁeld
seeking). To focus ground state atoms, and molecules in
strong-ﬁeld-seeking states, in both transverse directions,
it is necessary to use at least two lenses in an alternating
gradient conﬁguration[1, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].
Each lens focuses in one transverse direction while defo-
cusing in the other. A single electrostatic lens can not
focus strong ﬁeld seeking states because an electric ﬁeld
that is uniform along the beam direction cannot also have
a maximum in both transverse directions.
(For atoms
and molecules in weak-ﬁeld-seeking states, a single lens
can focus in both transverse directions because an elec-
tric ﬁeld that is uniform along the beam direction can
have a minimum in both transverse directions.)

A net focusing in both transverse directions is achieved
using alternating gradients so that the focusing (defo-
cusing) in the ﬁrst lens is in the same direction as the
defocusing (focusing) in the second lens. Atoms defo-
cused, in say the x direction, in the ﬁrst lens, are further
from the centerline in the second lens and experience a
stronger restoring force. Atoms focused in the y direc-
tion, in the ﬁrst lens, are closer to the centerline and ex-
perience smaller defocusing in the second lens. For best
results the forces should be linear in the displacement in
|x| and |y| from the z axis.

It is important to note that the force does not depend
on the direction of the electric ﬁeld. Therefore, all lenses
can have their electric ﬁelds pointing in the same direc-
tion as shown in Fig.1a.

The focusing direction is determined by the curvature
of the electrodes, as shown in Fig.1b. The F lens focuses
atoms and molecules in strong-ﬁeld-seeking states in the

2

x direction and defocuses them in the y direction, while
the D lens defocuses in the x direction and focuses in
the y direction. The shapes of the electrodes are care-
fully chosen to produce forces on the atoms that have the
smallest nonlinearities in both x and y.

Although an F-D or D-F lens doublet can focus a beam
in both transverse planes, the ratio of image size to ob-
ject size (magniﬁcation) in the two planes are unequal:
if one magniﬁcation is less than one, the other will be
greater than one. We therefore chose a triplet (D-F-D)
lens, shown in Fig.1, which, with suﬃcient strength, al-
lows us to focus the beam equally in both planes down
to a magniﬁcation of 0.5.

III.

LENS DESIGN

To specify the transverse electric ﬁelds for the lenses,
we expand the electric ﬁeld potential in multipoles. For
an atom or a molecule in a strong-ﬁeld-seeking state, the
electric ﬁeld that comes closest to producing forces that
are linear in displacement from the z axis of the lens is
the ﬁeld generated by the combination of a sextupole po-
tential plus a dipole potential[17]. (A sextupole alone will
defocus in both transverse directions and a quadrupole
component is not used because it will deﬂect the atoms.)
A small decapole potential may improve the linearity
slightly, but otherwise the presence of higher order terms
(found in cylindrical electrodes) produces forces that are
non-linear in the displacement. Non-linear forces cause
beam loss and larger, more diﬀuse, beams.

the electrodes at x = 0 is 8 mm. For atoms and molecules in
strong-ﬁeld-seeking states, the forces in the D lens are towards
y = 0 and away from x = 0 and in the F lens, the forces are
away from y = 0 and towards x = 0.

where the primes denote derivatives in z, Ey0 (z) ≡

along the z axis (x = y = 0), and A3 is the sextupole
strength relative to the dipole strength. A3 is positive
for a D lens and a negative for an F lens. The last term
in Eq.1 accounts for the defocusing in the y direction,
due to the fringe ﬁelds, as the atoms enter or exit a lens.

where rp is the half-gap spacing of the electrodes at xp =

the restriction yp ≥ rp for a convex F lens and rp ≥ yp >
0 for a concave D lens.

In our electrodes the half-gap rp is 4 mm and the sex-
tupole strengths are A3 = −4.031 × 103 m−2 for the F
lens and A3 = 4.444 × 103 m−2 for the D lens.

Polar molecules in strong-ﬁeld-seeking states such as
J = 0 also require alternating gradient focusing and this
has been the subject of a number of experiments[9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Although the potential energy
W and hence dW/dE of polar molecules is of a diﬀer-
ent form than for atoms, the same lenses can be used for
both atoms and polar molecules with only a small dif-
ference in linearity[17]. The lens electrodes used in the
measurements, described in Section V B, were originally
designed for focusing the J = 0 rotational state of a jet-
source methyl ﬂuoride beam.

The three moments in the x direction deﬁne the RMS

emittance: ǫxvx =

p
forces, the phase space density and emittance area (e.g.,
ǫxvx = σxσvy at a focus where σxvx = 0) remain constant
(and similarly for the y direction).

In our experiment, the cesium atoms, initially launched
into the fountain as a small bunch, with a non-zero
temperature, become distributed in longitudinal position
and velocity (z, vz). This will smear out the transverse
edges of the beam because the low velocity atoms will be
(slightly) over focused and the high velocity atoms will
be (slightly) underfocused.

V. EXPERIMENT

A. Apparatus

We measured the focusing properties of the triplet of
lenses, shown in Fig. 1, by passing bunches of slow, cold,
cesium atoms through the lenses and into a detection
region as shown and described in Fig. 2. Our basic cesium

atoms are launched at 4.7 m/s and pass through a square
aperture (not shown) to remove those atoms whose trajectory
falls outside the aperture of the triplet lens situated a short
distance above. In (a) the magniﬁcation is one and the cesium
atom proﬁle is measured by scanning the laser beam near the

by scanning a jaw separately in the x and y directions at
this focus and measuring the transmitted beam with the laser
probe.

trap and launches the atoms as a moving molasses, has
been previously described in Ref.’s [6, 7].

The order of lenses in the triplet can be either D–F–D
or F–D–F. We chose D–F–D because it makes the beam
smallest in the y direction inside the lenses, where the
electrodes limit the aperture.

The fringe ﬁeld defocusing (in the y direction) is signif-
icant, especially when the beam size is a large fraction of
the gap spacing, and/or the beam velocity is low. There-
fore it is important to minimize the size and number of
fringe ﬁelds and to accurately include the remaining de-
focusing eﬀects in the calculations.

To minimize y direction defocusing between the F and
D lenses, the changes in the electric ﬁeld between lenses
should be kept small[7]. We therefore used the same ori-
entation of electric ﬁelds in all three lenses and designed
the lenses to operate at nearly the same voltages. As a
result of using similar lens voltages, the spacing between
F and D lenses could be reduced to one millimeter and
the electrode ends where the F and D lenses faced each
other needed very little rounding (about one millimeter
radius).

With only a small change in the magnitude of the elec-
tric ﬁeld between lenses and with all of the main (dipole)
ﬁelds in the same direction, the atoms traveling between
the F and D lenses experience only a very small fringe-
ﬁeld-induced defocusing (the second term in Eq. 5). To

4

minimize the y direction fringe-ﬁeld defocusing at the
entrance and exit of the triplet, the outer ends of the D
lenses were rounded to a radius of four millimeters.

In the D lens, the electrodes are concave and had to be
terminated at some reasonable minimum gap between the
electrodes (Fig.1). We mistakenly chose a simple round-
ing of the transverse edges of the D lens. This perturbed
the central ﬁeld, reducing the linear focusing strengths
ax and ay in Eq. 5 from their ideal value of 1 to as low
as 0.8. These reduced values of ax and ay were used in
the trajectory calculations.

The simple rounding also introduced their own nonlin-
earities in the forces. Further modeling has shown that a
small correction to the rounding of the transverse edges
can restore focusing strength and eliminate these nonlin-
earities. However, our existing lenses could not be easily
modiﬁed to include this correction, so instead the trajec-
tory calculations used the reduced focusing strength and
increased nonlinearities.

The triplet electrodes are made from an aluminum al-
loy whose electric ﬁeld holding property is adequate for
our ≤ 5.5 MV/m electric ﬁelds. Aluminum alloy is less
expensive to machine than stainless steel and is nonmag-
netic. The electrodes are supported by ceramic spacers
attached to a grounded frame. Both of the D lenses are
connected to the same pair of positive and negative high
voltage supplies (largely motivated by a limited access for
high voltage connections in our fountain apparatus). The
F lens, between the D lenses, has a separate pair of high
voltage power supplies to allow for tuning the triplet.
Each lens has an 8 mm spacing between electrodes (rp =
4 mm) along the centerline. The lens aperture and over-
all length is smaller than ideal, having been restricted
by the limited space in our existing fountain apparatus.
This limits the intensity but does not change the focusing
principles.

FIG. 3: The series of voltages applied to the F and D lenses
for a double focus. Each combination of voltages that gener-
ates a focus in both x and y at the same vertical location is a
tune. Increasing tune number corresponds to higher voltages
and increased focusing. Tune number 6 gives a double waist
just ahead of the laser probes and with a magniﬁcation of one.

B. Measurements

We performed three sets of focusing measurements. In
the ﬁrst set, we imaged the cesium trap with a magni-
ﬁcation of about one in both x and y.
In the second
set we raised the voltages, thereby increasing the focus-
ing strength and imaged the trap with a magniﬁcation of
about 0.5. In the third set, we adjusted the voltages to
produce: ﬁrst, a parallel beam in the y direction with a
waist in the x direction, then a nearly parallel beam in
the x direction with a waist in the y direction.

The experimental arrangement for imaging the cesium
trap, with a magniﬁcation close to one, is shown schemat-
ically in Fig. 2a. We measured the size of the cesium
beam near the focus by scanning with a one mm diam-

cling transition at 852 nm and the ﬂuorescence light is
detected by a photomultiplier tube.

Diﬀerent sets of voltages applied to the F and D lenses
bring the cesium atoms to a focus at diﬀerent vertical
positions. The voltage pairs for the lenses that produce
a minimum in both x and y at a given location (double
waist) along the z axis is called a tune and is plotted in
Fig.3.

The beam widths observed, at the laser probe, for the
tunes of Fig3, are shown in Fig.4. In the low tune num-
bers, the focusing is weaker and the focus is beyond the
laser probe scan, resulting in a larger size at the probe.
The measured beam proﬁles, at the laser probe then nar-
row as the tune voltages increase and the focus moves to
the laser probe. In tune number 6, we measured a half-
width at half-maximum (HWHM) focus of 1.64 mm (x)
by 1.05 mm (y). The widths of the beam proﬁles, at the
laser probe, then increase as the higher voltages pull the
focus closer to the trap.

culations can be used to make reliable predictions.

A comparison of the integrated intensity of the cesium
beam proﬁle, at the focus (tune 6 in Fig.4), with the
cesium beam proﬁle for no electric ﬁeld (labeled oﬀ in
Fig.4) shows a loss of about half of the cesium atoms
when the beam is focused. This is the result of nonlin-
earities that make the linear focusing region of the triplet
lens smaller than the lens aperture. If we assume that
both transverse directions contribute equally to the loss,
then the triplet lens has an eﬀective aperture of 5.7 mm
diameter, compared to the 8 mm center axis electrode
spacing.

Some of the nonlinearity in the focusing is due to the
truncation of the D-lens equipotential and can be cor-
rected in future lens designs, but the remainder is due to
inherent nonlinearities in the lens, even for a pure dipole
plus sextuple ﬁeld. The inherent nonlinearities can be
reduced by designing the lenses with smaller A3 (Eq.1).
This will result in a larger linear-focusing aperture but
lower focusing strength. The lower focusing strength
(Eq.5) can be compensated for by using a longer lens
or a stronger ﬁeld.
(If the lens were constructed from
cylindrical electrodes, the linear region would be further
reduced and the eﬀective aperture much smaller[17])

To image the trap with a magniﬁcation of 0.5 we in-
creased the voltages on the triplet lens to the values
shown in tune 9 of Fig.3. Figure7 shows the modeling
for this tune. The voltage increase causes the focus to
move closer to the lenses and away from the laser probe.
The new focal point coincides with a set of four mov-
able jaws (Fig.2b) and these were used to proﬁle the

beam (Fig.8). The minimum waist for this tune was
found to be 0.62 mm×0.65 mm HWHM (compared to
1.64 mm×1.05 mm for the magniﬁcation of one), and
again in agreement with calculation (Fig.7).

In the third set of measurements, we created a strong
astigmatism in the triplet lens.
In the ﬁrst astigmatic
tune we produced, in the y direction, a 2.5 mm HWHM
beam with a low divergence, while focusing in the x di-
rection to a 0.8 mm waist at the collimation jaws. The
beam envelope for this tune is shown in Fig.9 and the
measured proﬁles are shown in Fig.10. The x waist is

close to that of the x waist of the 0.5 magniﬁcation tune
(Figs.7,8) but the y direction is now collimated.

In the second astigmatic tune, the focusing in x and
y were reversed: The cesium fountain had the low-
divergence 2.5 mm HWHM in the x direction while fo-
cusing to 0.70 mm HWHM in the y direction. A tune
with low divergence in both the x and y directions could
be used with a collimator could reduce the cesium-cesium
scattering in a cesium fountain clock.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

A three-element alternating-gradient electrostatic lens
composed only of sextupole and dipole equipotentials and
with the main ﬁelds all pointing in the same direction has
been designed, built, and tested. The triplet predictably
and eﬃciently focuses a fountain of cesium atoms to im-
ages of diﬀerent magniﬁcations or into beams with very
small divergence, in agreement with calculation. Lenses
of this design have application in atomic clocks, EDM ex-
periments, and the focusing of polar molecules in strong-
ﬁeld-seeking states.

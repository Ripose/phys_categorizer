Abstract

The Tera Electronvolt Superconducting Linear Accelerator TESLA is the only linear
electron-positron collider project based on superconductor technology for particle
acceleration. In the ﬁrst stage with 500 GeV center-of-mass energy an accelerating
ﬁeld of 23.4 MV/m is needed in the superconducting niobium cavities which are
operated at a temperature of 2 K and a quality factor Q0 of 1010. This performance
has been reliably achieved in the cavities of the TESLA Test Facility (TTF) ac-
celerator. The upgrade of TESLA to 800 GeV requires accelerating gradients of 35
MV/m. Using an improved cavity treatment by electrolytic polishing it has been
possible to raise the gradient to 35 - 43 MV/m in single cell resonators. Here we
report on the successful transfer of the electropolishing technique to multi-cell cav-
ities. Presently four nine-cell cavities have achieved 35 MV/m at Q0 ≥ 5 × 109,
and a ﬁfth cavity could be excited to 39 MV/m. In two high-power tests it could
be veriﬁed that EP-cavities preserve their excellent performance after welding into
the helium cryostat and assembly of the high-power coupler. One cavity has been
operated for 1100 hours at the TESLA-800 gradient of 35 MV/m and 57 hours at
36 MV/m without loss in performance.

1 Introduction

Electron-positron colliders have played a central role in the discovery of new
quarks and leptons and the formulation and detailed veriﬁcation of the Stan-
dard Model of elementary particle physics. Circular colliders beyond LEP are
ruled out by the huge synchrotron radiation losses, increasing with the fourth
power of energy. Hence a linear collider is the only viable approach to center-
of-mass energies in the TeV regime. Such a linear lepton collider would be
complementary to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and allow detailed studies
of the properties of the Higgs particle(s). In the baseline design of the super-
conducting TESLA collider [1] the center-of-mass energy is 500 GeV (TESLA-
500), well above the threshold for the production of the Standard-Model Higgs
particle. The possibility for a later upgrade to 800 GeV (TESLA-800) is con-
sidered an essential feature to increase the research potential of the facility for
the study of supersymmetry and physics beyond the Standard Model.

The design gradient of the TESLA-500 niobium cavities (23.4 MV/m) was
chosen at a time when the typical accelerating ﬁelds in superconducting cavi-
ties were in the order of 3–5 MV/m. The factor of ﬁve increase presented an
ambitious goal which, however, has been reached owing to the concentrated
R&D eﬀorts of the TESLA collaboration and of other institutions. A detailed
description of the nine-cell cavities for the TESLA Test Facility (TTF) linac
can be found in [2]. In the most recent series of 24 industrially produced TTF
cavities the average gradient was measured to be 25 ± 2.6 MV/m at a quality
factor Q0 = 1010. After the fabrication process these resonators were cleaned
at DESY by chemical etching (“buﬀered chemical polishing BCP”, see below)
and subjected to a 1400◦C heat treatment to enhance the low-temperature
thermal conductivity of the niobium.

After many years of intensive R&D there exists now compelling evidence that
the BCP process limits the attainable ﬁeld in multi-cell niobium cavities to
about 30 MV/m, signiﬁcantly below the physical limit of about 45 MV/m
which is given by the condition that the rf magnetic ﬁeld has to stay below the
critical ﬁeld of the superconductor. For the type II superconductor niobium
the maximum tolerable rf ﬁeld appears to be close to the thermodynamic
critical ﬁeld (190 mT at 2 Kelvin).

Since a number of years, an improved preparation technique of the inner cavity
surface by electrolytic polishing (or “electropolishing” for short) has opened
the way to gradients of 35 - 43 MV/m in 1.3 GHz single-cell cavities [3,4]. This
development motivated a thorough R&D program on the electropolishing (EP)
of single-cell test cavities. The results have been published recently [5]. In the

nine-cell TESLA cavities.

2 Preparation of the inner cavity surface

2.1 Chemical etching and electrolytic polishing

Here we give a short outline of the chemical and electro-chemical methods
which are applied to clean and prepare the inner cavity surface after the
fabrication process. More details are found in [5]. Niobium metal has a natural
Nb2O5 layer with a thickness of about 5 nm which is chemically rather inert
and can be dissolved only with hydroﬂuoric acid (HF). The sheet rolling of
niobium produces a damage layer of about 100 µm thickness that has to be
removed in order to obtain a surface with excellent superconducting properties.
One possibility is chemical etching which consists of two alternating processes:
dissolution of the Nb2O5 layer by HF and re-oxidation of the niobium by a
strongly oxidizing acid such as nitric acid (HNO3) [6,7]. To reduce the etching
speed a buﬀer substance is added, for example phosphoric acid H3PO4 [8], and
the mixture is cooled below 15◦C. The standard procedure with a removal
rate of about 1 µm per minute is called buﬀered chemical polishing (BCP)
with an acid mixture containing 1 part HF (40%), 1 part HNO3 (65%) and
2 parts H3PO4 (85%) in volume. At TTF, a closed-circuit chemistry system
is used in which the acid is pumped from a storage tank through a cooling
system and a ﬁlter into the cavity and then back to the storage.

A gentler preparation method is provided by electrolytic polishing (EP). The
material is removed in an acid mixture under the ﬂow of an electric current.
Sharp edges are smoothed out and a very glossy surface can be obtained. The
electric ﬁeld is high at protrusions so these will be dissolved readily while
the ﬁeld is low in the boundaries between grains and little material will be
removed here. This is an essential diﬀerence to the BCP process which tends
to enhance the steps at grain boundaries.

The electro-chemical processes are as follows [9,10]:

2Nb + 5SO

−−

4 + 5H2O → Nb2O5 + 10H+ + 5SO

−−

4 + 10e−

Nb2O5 + 6HF → H2NbOF5 + NbOF2 · 0.5H2O + 1.5H2O

NbOF2 · 0.5H2O + 4HF → H2NbF5 + 1.5H2O

The roughness of electropolished niobium surfaces is less than 0.1 µm [11]
while chemically etched surfaces are at least an order of magnitude rougher.

The main advantage of EP is the far better smoothening of the ridges at grain
boundaries. An electropolishing of at least 100 µm is needed both for surface
smoothening and damage layer removal.

2.2 Electropolishing of nine-cell cavities

At the KEK laboratory a long-term experience exists with the electropolishing
of multi-cell cavities. The ﬁve-cell 508 MHz cavities of the TRISTAN electron-
positron storage ring [12] were electropolished by an industrial company (No-
mura Plating). Within a joint KEK-DESY program 9 TESLA nine-cell res-
onators of the most recent industrial production have been electropolished at
Nomura Plating. The EP parameters are summarized in table 1.

The cavity is installed horizontally (see ﬁgure 1) together with the aluminum
cathode. The lower half of the cavity is ﬁlled with the electrolyte which reacts
with the the niobium surface only very slowly when no voltage is applied (etch
rate less than 1 nm per hour). After the equilibrium ﬁlling level has been
reached, the cavity is put into rotation and the voltage is applied between
cavity and cathode while the current-voltage relationship is monitored. At a
voltage of 15 - 20 V, the current through the electrolyte starts to oscillate
indicating that the following two processes are taking place in alternating
order: dissolution of the Nb2O5 by HF and re-oxidation of the Nb by H2SO4.
The best polishing results are obtained for a current oscillation of 10 - 15%
about the mean value. The temperature of the acid mixture is kept in the
range 30 - 35◦C. Temperatures above 40◦C must be avoided as they result in
etching pits on the surface. When the desired amount of material has been
removed, the current is switched oﬀ. The rotation is stopped and the cavity
is put into vertical position to drain the acid mixture. After rinsing with pure
water the electrode is dismounted while keeping the cavity ﬁlled with water,
thus avoiding drying stains from acid residues. The cavity is then transported
into a clean room for high-pressure water rinsing.

An electropolishing facility for nine-cell cavities has recently been commis-
sioned at DESY. The electrolyte is circulated in a closed loop. The cathode
is made from pure aluminum and is surrounded with a tube made from a
porous PTFE 1 cloth to prevent the electrolytically produced hydrogen from
reaching the niobium surface. Except for the cathode all components of the
EP system are made from chemically inert plastic materials, e.g. Polyperﬂu-
oro Alkoxyethylene (PFA), Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) or PTFE. The
acid mixture is stored in a Teﬂon-cladded container and water cooled via a
Teﬂon-covered heat exchanger. The electrolyte is pumped with a membrane
pump through a cooler and a ﬁlter with 1 µm pore size into the hollow cath-
ode which has openings at the centers of the cavity cells. Inside the cavity
the volume above the electrolyte is ﬁlled with dry nitrogen to prevent water
vapour absorption by the strongly hygroscopic H2SO4. The exhaust gases are
pumped through a neutralization system to avoid environmental hazards.

3 Performance measurements on electropolished nine-cell cavities

3.1 Low-power tests in the accelerating mode

All nine electropolished cavities were cleaned at DESY by rinsing with ul-
trapure water at high pressure. After the drying in a class-100 clean room, a

low-power input coupler and a pickup antenna were mounted and the cavity
was closed with UHV vacuum ﬂanges. A ﬁrst performance test was carried out
in a vertical bath cryostat ﬁlled with superﬂuid helium at 2 Kelvin. In this
cryostat, the rf power of a few 100 watts is transmitted into the cavity through
a movable antenna in the beam pipe section of the cavity. The external quality
factor Qext is adjusted to be close to the intrinsic quality factor Q0 ≈ 1010.
The time constant of the cavity is determined by the “loaded quality factor”

τ =

with QL = (

Qext

)−1 ≈

.

QL
ω0

A typical value is τ ≈ 1 s. When the cavity is operated in the pulsed mode
the intrinsic quality factor can be easily computed from the time decay of the
stored energy. The coupling strength of the pickup antenna to the electric ﬁeld
inside the cavity is determined by pulsed measurements at low gradient. Once
this calibration is known the excitation curve Q0(Eacc) can be measured in
the continuous wave (cw) mode.

In the low-power test, two cavities showed strong ﬁeld emission at 15-17
MV/m. These were sorted out for a second EP which is planned to take place
in the recently commissioned EP facility at DESY (see below).

The remaining seven cavities without strong ﬁeld emission, having passed the
low-power test successfully, were then evacuated to a pressure of 10−7 mbar
and subjected to a 48-hour bake-out at 120◦C. According to the experience
with the single-cell cavities [4,5,13,14] this bakeout is an essential prerequiste
for achieving high gradients in electropolished cavities. After the bakeout the
performance tests in the vertical bath cryostat were repeated. The results of
these second tests are discussed in the following.

The excitation curves of the four best cavities after EP at KEK are shown in
ﬁgure 2. In November 2003 one of the ﬁeld-emission loaded cavities has been
repolished in the new EP facility at DESY. The test results of this cavity at
helium temperatures between 1.6 and 2.0 K are shown in Fig. 3 . Accelerating
ﬁelds of up to 40 MV/m have been reached which is a record for multicell
niobium cavities. The maximum accelerating ﬁelds achieved in all eight TTF
cavities after bakeout are shown in ﬁgure 4. These results prove that the
TESLA-800 gradient of 35 MV/m is indeed within reach.

3.2 Performance of single cells in the nine-cell cavities

In an N-cell cavity, each single-cell eigenmode splits up into N coupled modes
which are characterized by an rf phase advance of m · π/N between neigh-
bouring cells (m = 1, . . . N). For a perfectly tuned cavity the normalized

2 K and of 40 MV/m below 1.8 K was achieved.

where m is the mode index, j the cell number and δmN is the Kronecker
symbol (δmN = 1 for m = N and 0 otherwise). Only in the π mode with
m = N (the accelerating mode) the electric ﬁeld has the same magnitude
in each cell. By measuring the excitation curves for all coupled modes it is
possible to determine the maximum attainable ﬁeld in each cell, apart from
a left-right ambiguity: in a nine-cell structure the cells 1 and 9, 2 and 8, 3
and 7, 4 and 6 are indistuinguishable in this analysis. The mode analysis is
therefore a useful tool to identify cells of lower performance and to enhance
the statistical basis for comparing the relative beneﬁts of various chemical
or electro-chemical treatments. It should be noted, though, that the electric
ﬁeld amplitudes in the cells depend critically on slight frequency detunings
from cell to cell. Therefore the accelerating gradients derived from the mode
analysis have a larger systematic uncertainty (≈ 15 %) than the gradient in
the accelerating π mode which is determined with an accuracy of 8%.

The single-cell performance of etched and electropolished cavities is compared
in ﬁgure 5. In the BCP-treated nine-cell TTF cavities of the third production
series, the average maximum gradient amounts to 28.9 MV/m. The electrolyt-
ically polished cavities, on the other hand, achieve an average single-cell gradi-
ent of 35.6 MV/m. (As mentioned above, one cavity with heavy ﬁeld-emission
loading has been left out). This is clear evidence that electropolishing is far
superior to chemical etching in the preparation of the rf surface of the cavities.

quent etching with a removal of 5 to 65 µm.

The superiority of electropolishing was convincingly demonstrated in an earlier
experiment at KEK, see ﬁgure 6 [3]. A single-cell (S-3) cavity reached 38
MV/m after an EP 120 µm. A subsequent chemical etching of 60 resp. 130 µm
reduced the gradient to 29 resp. 24 MV/m. A new electropolishing (50 µm)
recovered the initial high performance. Studies at DESY on electropolished

single-cell and multi-cell cavities conﬁrmed the performance degradation due
to a subsequent etching, see ﬁgure 7. An etching of just 20 µm reduced the
maximum accelerating gradient by 5 MV/m.

3.3 Long-term stability of the electropolished surface

The remarkable improvement of niobium cavities gained by electropolishing
will of course only be useful for the accelerator if the EP surface preserves its
good properties over a long time period. In a ﬁrst endurance test at Saclay
an EP-treated 1-cell cavity was exposed to clean air for 2 months without a
signiﬁcant change in performance. This was veriﬁed in experiments at DESY
(see ﬁgure 8) for a period of 6 months. One single-cell cavity was ﬁlled with
nitrogen and kept for more than 18 months. In this case a reduction of the
initial, very high gradient was observed but the usable gradient was still above
35 MV/m, see Fig. 9.

Fig. 8. Accelerating gradient as a function of exposure time to clean air. Within the
measurement errors no diﬀerence in the behaviour of the cavities was observed.

3.4 High temperature heat treatments

3.4.1 Heat treatments of chemically etched cavities

The TTF cavities are made from niobium sheets by deep drawing and electron-
beam welding. Two high-temperature heat treatments are applied. The ﬁrst
step is a two-hour annealing at 800◦C in an Ultra High Vacuum (UHV) furnace
which serves two purposes: removal of dissolved hydrogen from the bulk nio-
bium and mechanical stress release from the deep drawn and welded multicell
structure. The second step is a four-hour treatment at very high temperature
(1400◦C) such that oxygen, nitrogen and carbon can diﬀuse out of the niobium.

A titanium layer is evaporated onto the niobium surface to getter the foreign
atoms and to protect the niobium against oxidation by the residual gas in the
UHV furnace. The residual resistivity ratio RRR and the low-temperature
heat conductivity of the bulk niobium increase by a factor of two, and the
average gradient in BCP-treated cavities grows by about 5 MV/m. The expe-
rience at TTF has shown that the 1400◦C heat treatment is an indispensible
prerequiste for achieving gradients above 25 MV/m with a surface preparation
by chemical etching (BCP).

It must be noted, however, that the 1400◦C annealing is accompanied with
a number of undesirable eﬀects: large grain growth, softening of the mate-
rial, necessity of an additional etching to remove the titanium getter layer. To
obtain good deep drawing properties the grain size of the niobium sheets is
in the order of 50 µm. There is little grain growth at 800◦C but during the
1400◦C annealing the grain size grows to several millimeters. The resulting
tensile strength is very low, about 5 MPa, hence the cavities are quite vulner-
able to plastic deformation and frequency detuning after the high-temperature
treatment. Another problem are the boundaries between the large grains. The
titanium getter penetrates deep into these boundaries, a depth of 60 µm has
been measured in samples. The titanium must be completely removed since
otherwise a drastically reduced performance is observed, see Fig. 10. For this
reason the TTF cavities are subjected to an 80 µm BCP after the 1400◦C
annealing.

3.4.2 Heat treatments of electropolished cavities

The moderate annealing at around 800◦C is an important cavity preparation
step which should be retained to avoid the danger of niobium hydride for-

layer and improvement after complete removal of this layer.

mation (”Q-disease”), see [5]. On the other hand, the experience gained at
KEK and DESY with the single-cell program justiﬁes the expectation that
the 1400◦C annealing can be safely discarded for electropolished cavities. The
Japanese 1-cell cavities [15] were heat treated at T = 760◦C only, and in spite
of a comparatively low residual resistivity ratio of RRR ≤ 300, achieved gra-
dients of 35 to 40 MV/m. In the CEA-CERN-DESY single-cell program [5]
seven cavities were tested after the 800◦C annealing with an average gradient
of 35.4±5.3 MV/m and three cavities were heat-treated at 1400◦C yielding
34.7±2.5 MV/m (see table 2).

The nine multicell TTF cavities sent to Japan for electrolytic polishing had
previously undergone the standard BCP treatment at TTF. Five cavities had
been annealed at 800◦C while four cavities were had been subjected to an ad-
ditional 1400◦C annealing. The ﬁeld-emission loaded cavity which was sorted
out belonged to the ﬁrst category. The maximum gradients achieved in the
eight remaining 9-cell resonators have already been shown in Fig. 4, the av-
erage value is < Eacc >= 34.0 ± 3.9 MV/m for the 800◦C-annealed cavities
and < Eacc >= 33.0 ± 3.3 MV/m for the 1400◦C-annealed cavities. Two
800◦C-annealed cavities belongs to the ﬁve excellent nine-cell cavities shown
in ﬁgures 2 and 3. From the single-cell analysis of the eight cavities the follow-
ing numbers are obtained: < Eacc >= 35.6 ± 2.8 MV/m for 800◦C-annealing
and < Eacc >= 35.6 ± 1.7 MV/m for 1400◦C-annealing (see table 2). These
results, combined with with the data from the single-cell R&D programs, pro-
vide convincing evidence that the 800◦C annealing alone is suﬃcient to achieve
excellent performance in electropolished nine-cell cavities.

In early 2004 a new series of nine-cell cavities will be delivered to DESY. It is
foreseen to prepare these cavities by electropolishing and test them after the
800◦C annealing. If the same promising results should be obtained than found

here, the 1400◦C annealing can certainly be avoided for the cavities of the
proposed X ray Free Electron Laser at DESY since this machine requires only
moderate acceleration ﬁelds. Further investigations will be needed to decide
whether the 1400◦C annealing would provide a larger safety margin for the
800 GeV option of the TESLA collider.

3.5 High-power pulsed operation of electropolished cavities

3.5.1 Excitation curves

In the TESLA collider the cavities have to be operated in the pulsed mode to
keep the heat load on the superﬂuid helium system within acceptable limits.
The rf power of about 210 kW per nine-cell cavity (for TESLA-500) is trans-
mitted through a coaxial power coupler. The external quality factor amounts
to Qext = 2.5 · 106 at an accelerating ﬁeld of 23.4 MV/m and an average beam
current of 9 mA (during the rf pulse). The cavity has a ﬁlling time of 500
µs and a “ﬂat-top” duration of 800 µs during which the bunched beam is
accelerated. The nominal pulse repetition rate is 10 Hz. The time constant of
the cavity equipped with a high-power coupler is dominated by the external
quality factor and practically insensitive to the intrinsic quality factor Q0 since

QL = (1/Q0 + 1/Qext)−1 ≈ Qext

for Qext ≪ Q0 .

Therefore, Q0 cannot be derived from the time decay of the stored energy but
instead has to be calculated from the heat transfer to the helium bath which
can be measured only with large errors at low ﬁelds.

So far, two cavities (AC72, AC73) were prepared for a high power test with-
out electron beam. The cavities were welded into a liquid helium tank and
equipped with a high power coupler and a frequency tuning mechanism. The
tests have been carried out in a horizontal cryostat at the TESLA Test Fa-
cility. Figure 11 shows the test results at a repetition rate of 5 Hz for AC73
and of 1 Hz for AC72 in comparison with the excitation curves measured in
the low-power tests. It is very encouraging that both cavities achieve the same

maximum gradient as in the low-power test. Within the large errors also the
quality factors are in agreement. Another very important result is that cav-
ity AC73 could be operated at 35 MV/m for more than 1100 hours and at
36 MV/m for 57 hours without any degradation.

The excitation curves obtained in the low power test in the vertical bath cryostat
are shown for comparison and prove that the excellent performance is preserved
after welding of the helium tank and assembly of the high power coupler.

Cavity AC73 was tested three times at a repetition rate of 10 Hz. Between
the ﬁrst two tests the cavity was warmed up to room temperature, between
tests 2 and 3 it was kept for several hours at 150 K to check for a possible Q

degradation through the formation of niobium hydrides. No indication of the
“Q-disease” was seen. In all three 10 Hz tests the same high performance as at
5 Hz was achieved. In cavity AC72 a lower quality factor was seen at repetition
frequencies above 1 Hz. This could be traced back to excessive heating at a
damaged cable connector of a higher-order mode coupler.

3.5.2 Frequency stabilization in pulsed operation

The Lorentz force between the rf magnetic ﬁeld and the induced currents in
a thin surface layer causes a slight deformation of the cells in the order of
micrometers and a shift in resonance frequency which is proportional to E2
acc.
In the pulsed operation of the 9-cell cavities this results in a time dependent
frequency shift during the rf pulse. The TESLA cavities are reinforced by
stiﬀening rings which are welded between neighbouring cells and reduce the
detuning by a factor of two. Experimental data on the detuning are shown in
Fig. 12. The “Lorentz force detuning” can be handled adequately by the rf
control system up to the nominal TESLA-500 gradient of 23.4 MV/m.

decay of cavity ﬁeld for t > 1300 µs.

To allow for higher gradients the stiﬀening must be improved, or alterna-
tively, the cavity detuning must be compensated. The latter approach has
been successfully demonstrated using a piezoelectric tuner, see Fig. 13. The
piezo-actuator changes the cavity length dynamically by a few µm and stabi-
lizes the resonance frequency to better than 100 Hz during the ﬂat-top time.
The data in Fig. 13 prove that the stiﬀening rings augmented by a piezoelec-
tric tuning system will permit to operate the electropolished cavities at ﬁxed

15

resonance frequency up to the TESLA-800 gradient of 35 MV/m. In addition,
the piezoelectric actuator may be used to cancel microphonic noise between
the rf pulses.

Fig. 13. High-power pulsed test of an EP cavity at 35 MV/m. (a) Lorentz-force
detuning causes a mismatch between klystron and cavity, associated with a
time-dependent reduction of the accelerating ﬁeld and a strong variation of the cav-
ity phase with respect to the rf frequency. The compensation of the cavity detuning
by a piezoelectric actuator leads to a constant accelerating ﬁeld and a reduced drift
in the relative phase. (b) The measured detuning at 35 MV/m with and without

4 Discussion of the results and conclusions

A comprehensive understanding why electropolishing is so much superior to
chemical etching is still missing, however a few explanations exist. The sharp
ridges at the grain boundaries of an etched niobium surface may lead to local
enhancements of the rf magnetic ﬁeld and thereby cause a premature break-
down of superconductivity at these localized spots. A model based on this
idea was developed by Knobloch et al. [16] and can account for the reduction
of the quality factor Q0 at high ﬁeld. Magnetic ﬁeld enhancements will be
much smaller on the smooth EP surface. Another advantage of a mirror-like
surface is that a surface barrier of the Bean-Livingston type [17] may exist.
The surface barrier prevents the penetration of magnetic ﬂux into the bulk
niobium in a certain range beyond the lower critical ﬁeld Bc1 (≈ 160 mT for
niobium at 2 K). The “penetrating ﬁeld” Bpen exceeds Bc1 considerably for a
perfectly smooth surface. Magnetic ﬂuxoids will enter and leave the material
only above this penetrating ﬁeld, hence the power dissipation associated with
ﬂuxoid motion will start only at Brf > Bpen. The delayed ﬂux penetration
was experimentally veriﬁed in electropolished samples of the type II super-
conductors Pb-Tl and Nb0.993O0.007 [18,19]. The experiments showed also that
roughening of the surface by scratching and chemical etching destroyed the
barrier and reduced the penetrating ﬁeld to Bpen = Bc1. From these results we
may conclude that an EP-treated superconducting cavity is likely to remain
in the Meissner phase up to an rf magnetic ﬁeld exceeding Bc1 by a signiﬁcant
amount whereas a BCP-treated cavity will go into the mixed phase at Bc1 and
then suﬀer from enhanced power dissipation.

The two arguments for the superiority of electropolished cavities refer to the
topological structure of the surface: it is smooth for EP and rough for BCP.
However, the positive inﬂuence of the 120◦C bakeout on the high-ﬁeld per-
formance of EP-cavities cannot be explained that way because the surface
topology will not be changed by the bakeout. For a discussion of conceivable
physico-chemical processes occuring during the bakeout we refer to the review
talk by B. Visentin at the recent SRF2003 workshop [20].

In summary we can say that electropolished bulk niobium cavities oﬀer the
high accelerating gradients which are required for the upgrade of the TESLA
collider to 800 GeV. For the ﬁrst time, accelerating ﬁelds of 35 MV/m have
been achieved in nine-cell cavities. One cavity could be excited to 39 MV/m
even without the 1400◦C heat treatment, which is an indispensible prerequisite
for the BCP-treated TTF cavities to reach 25 MV/m. In two high-power tests
it could be veriﬁed that EP-cavities preserve their excellent performance after
welding into the helium cryostat and assembly of the high-power coupler. One
cavity has been operated for 1100 hours at the TESLA-800 gradient of 35
MV/m and 57 hours at 36 MV/m without loss in performance.

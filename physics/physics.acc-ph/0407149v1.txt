The eﬀects of electron clouds on positively-charged beams have been an active area of research in
recent years at particle accelerators around the world. Transverse beam-size blow-up due to electron
clouds has been observed in some machines, and is considered to be a major limiting factor in the
development of higher-current, higher-luminosity electron-positron colliders. The leading proposed
mechanism for beam blow-up is the excitation of a fast head-tail instability due to short-range
wakes within the electron cloud. We present here observations of betatron oscillation sidebands in
bunch-by-bunch spectra that may provide direct evidence of such head-tail motion in a positron
beam.

The development of clouds of electrons in positively-
charged-beam storage rings has been observed at several
machines, including the KEKB Low Energy Ring (LER),
a 3.5 GeV positron storage ring which is part of the KEK
B-Factory. Observations at the KEKB LER of betatron
tune shifts along a bunch train via gated tune meter [1],
and of transverse bunch size along the train via high-
speed gated camera [2] and streak camera [3], show a
characteristic increase of transverse tune shifts and beam
size starting near the head of the train, reaching satura-
tion at some point along the train. Simulations of elec-
tron cloud density due to photo-electrons being drawn
towards the positron beam have shown a similar build
up of cloud density along the train, reaching saturation
at some point [4, 5]. Electrons from the cloud have also
been measured directly via electrode [6]. Solenoids have
been wound around approximately 95% of the drift space
in the LER, with a maximum ﬁeld at the center of the
beam pipe of 45 Gauss [7]. The beam size blow-up has
been observed to occur at a threshold average bunch cur-
rent, which is raised when the solenoids are powered on
[8]. The beam blow-up has been found to reduce the
speciﬁc luminosity of the aﬀected bunches [8].

One proposed mechanism for the beam blow-up due to
the presence of electron clouds is a strong head-tail in-
stability caused by wake ﬁelds caused by the passage of
the bunch particles through the cloud [9]. Attempts have
been made to observe this head-tail motion directly via
streak camera [3], but have been unsuccessful, possibly
due to a lack of suﬃcient light intensity. A vertical side-
band peak has been reported for a proton beam at the
CERN SPS which could be an indication of head-tail mo-
tion [10], though no clear signature has yet been reported
at a positron machine. We report here on observations
of a sideband peak, above the betatron tune, which may
provide direct evidence of such a coupled-mode spectral
peak in a positron beam.

Observations were made using signals taken from a pair
of Beam Position Monitor (BPM) electrodes, which are

from 0.5 on the left edge to 0.7 on the right edge. The verti-
cal axis is bunch number in the train, from 1 on the bottom
edge to 100 on the top edge. The bunches in the train are
spaced 4 RF buckets (about 8 ns) apart. The bright, curved
line on the left is the vertical betatron tune, made visible by
reducing the bunch-by-bunch feedback gain by 6 dB from the

mounted on the beam pipe, and measure 6 mm in di-
ameter. The diﬀerence signal from two electrodes on
opposite sides of the beam pipe is detected at 2.032
GHz (=4 × fRF ), and recorded by the Bunch Oscilla-
tion Recorder (BOR), which is a diagnostic tool in the
bunch-by-bunch feedback system [11, 12]. The BOR it-
self consists of an 8-bit digitizer front-end, with a 20-
MByte memory, which is capable of storing one beam
centroid position measurement per bunch for all 5120 RF
buckets in the ring over 4096 turns.

Data were taken at the LER on 24 June 2004, in single-
beam mode (no colliding bunches in the HER) and with
the majority of the solenoids turned oﬀ. The ﬁll pattern
consisted of four trains of bunches, spaced evenly around
the ring. Each train consisted of 100 bunches, spaced 4
RF buckets (≈ 8 ns) apart. In Figure 1, the spectrum

peak is visible at 0.588, and the sideband peak can be seen
around 0.64.

FIG. 3: Eﬀect of changing synchrotron tune on the separa-
tion between sideband peak and betatron peak.
In a), the
sideband-betatron peak separation is plotted along the bunch
train for νs = 0.0246 (solid lines) and νs = 0.0234 (dashed
lines). In b), the diﬀerence between the two curves is plotted.
Statistical 1-sigma error bars are shown.

for each bunch is plotted, with fractional tune on the
horizontal axis and bunch number on the vertical axis.
The betatron tune (made visible by lowering the gain of
the bunch-by-bunch feedback system) is seen as the left
curved line. The betatron tune is seen to shift succes-
sively higher as one moves from the head of the train
towards the tail, saturating at around the 40th bunch.
To the right of the νy peak is the sideband peak, which
likewise shifts along the train, until saturating a little
after the νy peak.

In experiments that have been performed over the past
year, it has been observed that the sideband peak ﬁrst ap-
pears near the bunch-current threshold of beam blow up.
In addition, the sideband has been observed to appear
in bunches at 1 mA per bunch and a 4-bucket spacing
only when the electron-cloud-suppression solenoids are
turned oﬀ. It has also been observed that changing the
vertical betatron tune causes the sideband peak to shift
by an equal amount, and in the same direction as that of
the betatron tune. Changing the horizontal tune has no
eﬀect on this sideband.

Figure 2a shows the observed bunch spectra with the
feedback gain set at the nominal value for physics run-
ning, −9.45 dB. In this plot, the Fourier power spectrum
of each bunch in the ring is calculated individually, then
the power spectra of all bunches are averaged together.
The horizontal scale is in units of fractional tune, and the
vertical scale is in units of µm2. The vertical betatron
tune can be seen as a broad, low peak at a fractional tune
of approximately 0.58-0.59. To the right of it can be seen
the sideband peak at approximately 0.64.

The vertical gain of the feedback system was lowered
by 6 dB, to the point where the beam started to be-
come slightly unstable, as seen in oscilloscope traces and
as reﬂected in a reduced lifetime for the beam. Under

these conditions, the vertical betatron peak becomes en-
hanced, as shown in Fig. 2b, however the sideband peak
amplitude is virtually unchanged.

Finally, the feedback was turned oﬀ entirely. The BOR
was set to record the 4096 turns immediately following
the feedback being turned oﬀ. As seen in Fig. 2c, the
betatron peak grows enormously, but the sideband peak
height is again essentially unchanged. This indicates that
this peak does not respond to dipole kicks from the feed-
back system. The estimated amplitude of the motion at
this peak is approximately 1.6 µm,or half of one percent
of the vertical beam size of 320 µm at the pickup location.
Experiments were done with changing the synchrotron
tune. In one set of measurements, the RF voltage was
reduced, which lowered the synchrotron tune by 0.0012.
The position of the sideband relative to the vertical be-
tatron tune for both values of νs are shown in Figure 3a;
the sidebands are visible starting from the ﬁfth bunch in
the train. The diﬀerence between the two curves is shown
in Figure 3b. The diﬀerence ranges from a maximum of
0.0012 (= δνs) at Bunch 6 to a minimum of approxi-
mately zero in some sections of the train. The average of
the peak separation over all bunches is not statistically
diﬀerent from zero.

Observations have also been made using the same BOR
memory recorder, but using a fast photo-multiplier tube
(PMT) as input device instead of a BPM electrode. A
Hamamatsu H6780 PMT, was set up to record the light
intensity from a focused image of the beam using syn-
chrotron radiation. The image was partially obscured in
the vertical direction, leaving only the upper edge of the
image visible. The spectra obtained via PMT were iden-
tical to those obtained from the BPM electrode, though

FIG. 4: Example time series of single bunches taken via a)
BPM and b) PMT. Diﬀerent bunches are shown for each de-
tector; the data were taken within one minute of each other.
A burst-like behavior is visible in the BPM signal. A fast
ramp-up behavior with a similar rise-time as the BPM burst
is seen in the PMT signal, followed by a gradual ramp-down.

with a lower signal-to-noise ratio. The amplitude of the
peak seen by PMT can only be crudely estimated, but
agrees roughly with that seen by the BPM electrode. One
feature that the PMT can detect that the BPM cannot
is changes in the beam size.

The time-series data of the BPM, shown in Fig. 4a,
reveal a burst-like time structure to the sideband oscilla-
tions. The sideband peak is present as a low level oscil-
lation that suddenly grows and damps in a burst lasting
∼ 500 turns (5 ms). A break down of the data into 512-
turn slices shows that the sideband peak is seen most
strongly during the burst, and disappears entirely just
after the burst.

In the PMT data, as seen in Fig.

4b, a similar
500-turn-duration phenomenon is observable wherein the
light level (beam size) increases over the course of 500
turns, then slowly damps afterwards, over the course of
∼ 1500 turns. A slice-by-slice breakdown of such events
reveals that the sideband peak is a maximum during
the ramp-up, and disappears momentarily just after the
burst.

The two sets of observations suggest that in the blown-
up state, a series of bursts and quiescent periods alter-
nate. During the bursts of violent dipole motion, the
beam size increases by a further ≈ 5% from its already
blown-up state. After it blows up, the dipole motion is
temporarily absent, as the emittance of the beam damps
down.

One possible interpretation for this sideband is that
it is a signature of mode-coupling due to the head-tail
instability predicted by Ohmi, Zimmermann and Pereve-
dentsev [13]. A notable feature of the side band is that
it occurs on the upper side of the betatron peak, which

suggests that the eﬀective wake function in the region
of the tail of the bunch is a focusing wake. A possi-
ble mechanism for producing such a wake is a pinch-
ing eﬀect on the electron cloud. Simulations of wakes
that change from defocusing to focusing with distance
along the bunch have been found in simulations using
the KEKB parameters [13, 14].

When the synchrotron tune is changed, the average
separation between the sideband peak and the betatron
peak does not change signiﬁcantly. In the case of strong
head-tail instability, the coupled mode frequency does
not necessarily depend strongly on νs. As an illustration,
mode spectra were generated using a toy model with an
airbag charge distribution and a simple eﬀective wake,
shown in Fig. 5, which uses a resonator-like wake W ,
increasing along (−z) to represent the enhancement of
the wake near the tail of the bunch due to pinching of
the electron cloud:

where α = ωR/4, and ωR = 2π × 40 GHz.

Plots of mode spectra as a function of eﬀective R/Q
are shown in Fig. 6 for synchrotron tunes of 0.022 and
0.024. As can be seen, the tune of the coupled mode
in the region far above the coupling threshold does not
change signiﬁcantly with the synchrotron tune. However,
the coupling point between the l = +1 mode (νy + νs)
and the l = +2 mode (νy + 2νs) shifts to the right. Since
the electron cloud density increases along the leading
bunches of the train, this change in the threshold would
lead one to expect the position of the ﬁrst bunch to ex-
hibit the sideband should shift as the synchrotron tune is
changed. To investigate this behavior near the threshold,
data originally taken on 23 December 2003 at two dif-
ferent values of the synchrotron tune were re-examined.
The LER was in single beam mode, with all solenoids
oﬀ. The bunches were stored at a four-bucket spacing,
at a bunch current of 0.52 mA/bunch. Due to the lower
bunch current, the growth of the sideband peak is more
gradual in this data set than it is in the July 2004 data
set. (Due to a high feedback gain, the betatron peak is
not pronounced enough to measure.) One set, of four
measurements, was taken at an RF voltage of 8 MV,
and the other set, of three measurements, was taken at 6
MV. The synchrotron tunes of the two sets, as measured
from the synchrotron peak visible in the spectra, were
0.0237 and 0.0203, respectively. The maximum-height
frequency bin in the region of the sideband was found for
each bunch in the train, and the peak heights of those
maximum bins were averaged together within each set.
The average peak heights, and 1-sigma statistical error
bars at each synchrotron tune are plotted as a function
of bunch number along the train in Fig. 7. As can be
seen, the development of the sideband peak height oc-
curs earlier in the train at the lower synchrotron tune, in
agreement with expectation.

Another eﬀect predicted by the head-tail theory is that
raising the vertical chromaticity should raise the thresh-
old for the onset of the instability. Data from 23 June
2003 were examined for such an eﬀect, and the onset
and rise of the slope was found to be delayed by sev-

4

eral bunches when the vertical chromaticity was changed
from 2.19 to 5.19. However, the beam current at the
higher chromaticity was also 5% lower than it was at the
lower chromaticity, so it cannot be ruled out that the
reduced beam current accounts for much or all of the
higher threshold. More measurements need to be taken
to conﬁrm this eﬀect.

Simulations and linear theory also indicate that for a
given cloud density, larger beam sizes should be more
stable due to a weaker beam-cloud interaction [13]. The
burst-like activity of the blown-up beam may be the
result of the beam size varying around some threshold
value, as the bunch alternates between states of emit-
tance growth due to the instability occurring when the
beam size is below the threshold, and the beam size
damping down once over the threshold.

A betatron sideband peak has been found in the verti-
cal tune spectrum of positron bunches in the presence of
beam-size blow-up due to electron clouds. The sideband
peak is on the upper side of the betatron peak in terms
of fractional tune, ﬁrst appears early in the bunch train,
and the separation between this peak and the betatron
tune peak increases going along the train, until it satu-
rates at a certain point. The best explanation for it is
that it is a signature of the head-tail instability hypothe-
sized to explain transverse beam blow-up due to electron
clouds. The presence of this sideband peak also provides
a sensitive diagnostic for the presence of electron clouds.

Abstract

Practical ionization cooling rings could lead to lower cost or improved performance in neutrino

factory or muon collider designs. The ring modeled here uses realistic three-dimensional ﬁelds. The

performance of the ring compares favorably with the linear cooling channel used in the second US

Neutrino Factory Study. The normalized 6D emittance of an ideal ring is decreased by a factor of

approximately 240, compared with a factor of only 15 for the linear channel. We also examine such

real-world eﬀects as windows on the absorbers and rf cavities and leaving empty lattice cells for

injection and extraction. For realistic conditions the ring decreases the normalized 6D emittance

by a factor of 49.

INTRODUCTION

Designs for neutrino factories [1] and muon colliders [2] use ionization cooling to reduce

the emittance of the muon beam prior to acceleration. Ionization cooling is currently the

only feasible option for cooling the beam within the muon lifetime (τo = 2.19 µs). If muons

alternately pass through a material absorber, and are then re-accelerated, and if there is

suﬃcient focusing at the absorber, then the transverse phase space is reduced, i.e. the muons

are cooled in the transverse dimension.

A consequence of the transverse cooling is an increase of the longitudinal phase space

caused by the unfavorable slope of the dE/dx curve for momenta below the ionization

minimum and by energy straggling in the material. The momentum spread can be reduced

if dispersion is introduced and a wedge-shaped absorber is placed such that high momentum

particles pass through more material than low momentum particles. However, when this

procedure is carried out the beam width is increased. The process is thus primarily an

exchange of emittance between the longitudinal and transverse dimensions. Moreover, when

combined with transverse cooling in the material, all three dimensions can be cooled.

Early muon collider studies had assumed that transverse cooling and emittance exchange

would be done in alternating stages. The transverse cooling used straight channels with

rf and absorbers, while the emittance exchange employed bent solenoids and wedges. A

serious problem with this approach was found to be the necessary matching between the

two types of lattices. However, there has been considerable progress over the past few years

in achieving 6D ionization cooling in cooling rings [3]. Ring coolers can overcome much of

this matching problem by rapidly alternating the two functions.

The ﬁrst ring cooler design [4, 5] was based on solenoid focusing. Alternate cells contained

• transverse cooling in a long solenoid containing acceleration and a single hydrogen

absorber

and a LiH wedge.

• emittance exchange in a cell containing two bending magnets, two opposed solenoids,

Matching between these cells has currently been achieved only with hard-edged magnetic

ﬁelds. Each pair of cells is long enough that at least one half-integer betatron resonance is

present within the momentum acceptance.

2

Later quadrupole-focused rings [6, 7] took the process a step further, using a single cell

type in which a wedge absorber cooled in both longitudinal and transverse phase space.

These ideas eased the lattice design, but introduced the possibility for transverse emittance

growth from energy straggling in the absorber, since it was now in a dispersive location.

In addition, the weaker focusing in such quadrupole lattices limits the available amount of

cooling and momentum acceptance. Current versions of this ring use edge-focused dipoles

instead of quadrupoles, and high pressure gas instead of wedge absorbers. [8]

At present the most realistic modeling of a cooling ring has been done for the RFOFO

cooling ring [9, 10, 11, 12]. The FOFO part of the name refers to the focusing-drift-focusing

nature of the solenoid lattice, in analogy to the FODO lattice for quadrupole channels. The

preﬁx R designates a particular type of FOFO lattice where the magnetic cell has the same

length as the geometric cell. As a result the axial ﬁeld changes polarity in the middle of

the cell. The ring discussed here follows the quadrupole design in the sense that it employs

a single cell for doing both transverse cooling and emittance exchange. However, we use

solenoidal focusing to obtain larger angular and momentum acceptances. The cell includes

dispersion, acceleration, and energy loss in a single thick hydrogen wedge. The overall layout

of the ring is shown in Fig. 1.

FIG. 1: (Color) GEANT drawing of an idealized RFOFO cooling ring [13]. The large cyan cylinders

are solenoids, the small red cylinders are the active volume of the rf cavities, and the blue wedges

are hydrogen absorbers.

Two solenoids in each cell with opposite polarity provide transverse focusing. The

solenoids are not equally spaced; those on either side of the absorbers are closer together

3

in order to increase the focusing at the absorber. The vertical bending ﬁeld is provided by

alternately tipping the axes of the solenoids above and below the orbital mid-plane. The

bending also provides the dispersion necessary for emittance exchange. A short cell length

is used to obtain a small beta function with a reasonable value of the solenoid ﬁeld strength.

Wedge-shaped absorbers are placed in the beam path at the locations where the solenoidal

ﬁeld changes direction and the beta function is at a minimum. The lattice has dispersion

at the rf cavities, which introduces synchro-betatron mixing and introduces some additional

emittance growth.

However, we ﬁnd that the disadvantage of having dispersion at the rf cavities is compen-

sated by the greater acceptance from the use of a single repeating cell with no integer or

half-integer betatron resonances in the momentum acceptance. In addition the longitudinal

cooling provided by the wedge-shaped absorber minimizes losses from particles falling out of

the rf bucket. Most of the lattice cell is ﬁlled with rf cavities that restore the energy lost in

the absorbers, but empty cells are included where injection and extraction can take place.

ﬁeld is produced by solenoids of 50 cm in length, with an inner radius of 77 cm and an outer
2
radius of 88 cm and a current density of ±95.27 A/mm

. The longitudinal ﬁeld on-axis has

an approximately sinusoidal dependence on position. The tilt angle of the solenoids was

adjusted to provide a mean vertical bending ﬁeld of 0.125 T. The centers of the solenoids

are displaced radially outward from the 33 m reference circle by 10 cm to minimize the

integrated on-axis radial ﬁeld, which causes vertical beam deviations.

The RFOFO ring was modeled using three independent simulation codes. One private

code was speciﬁcally written to examine this problem [14, 15, 16].

The second code was ICOOL [17], which has been widely used for neutrino factory and

muon collider simulations. It includes a ﬂexible system for specifying the problem geometry

and magnetic ﬁelds. For this application the ﬁelds were either read in from an external

ﬁle or calculated from on-axis multipoles. RF cavities were modeled as pillboxes, including

the Bessel function radial dependence. Many of the energy loss, scattering and straggling

routines in ICOOL are based on GEANT-3.21 [18].

5

The third code was the simulation software, MUC GEANT [19], which is an application of

GEANT-3.21, specially designed for muon cooling simulations. The Runge-Kutta routine

was changed to include electric ﬁelds, so that rf acceleration would be simulated properly.

The code is also data-driven, i.e. it allows the user to change the cooling channel parameters,

such as geometry, rf frequency/gradient and physics processes, without recompiling. The

magnetic ﬁeld was read in from an external ﬁle. The rf was modeled as a purely axial ﬁeld

with no transverse variation.

The 3-dimensional magnetic ﬁeld from the ring of tipped solenoids was calculated in three

other independent codes by summing the ﬁelds from a set of current sheets [15, 16, 20, 21].

There are some complexities in generating the ﬁelds for small rings which are much less

important for straight cooling channels. The coils being used in this design are large-

diameter, short, and carry high current; the maximum ﬁeld is several Tesla. The ring is

small, a little over 5 m in radius. We ignore for the moment the presence of any shielding

iron. Then from every point in the active (muon-accessible) region of the ring, a particle is

signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the ﬁeld generated by all the coils, even the ones on the other side

of the ring. Hence one must develop a single global ﬁeld map, rather than assuming that a

particle sees ﬁeld components only from the closest coils.

The ﬁeld of a solenoidal current sheet can be written analytically in terms of elliptic

integrals. The ﬁelds could also be generated from a set of coils using the Biot-Savart law.

The resultant ﬁeld components between the two methods agreed well and were shown to

satisfy Maxwell’s equations to a high level of accuracy (approximately 2 µT/m). For GEANT

a 3D ﬁeld map was generated on a cartesian grid with 1 cm spacing in each dimension. For

ICOOL we used a 3D ﬁeld map in cylindrical coordinates, also with 1 cm grid spacing in

each dimension. Because the ﬁelds were modeled from coils, all magnetic end ﬁeld eﬀects

are automatically included in the simulations. The on-axis ﬁeld components for one cell are

shown in Fig. 3.

multipoles.

Once the magnetic ﬁeld generator was working subsequent tracking could be done from

the ﬁeld calculated on a grid and saved to a map, or from multipoles [22] of the ﬁeld

calculated around a reference circle. Figure 4 shows the calculated multipoles for one cell

of the ring. The on-axis transverse ﬁeld has a rich spectrum of higher normal and skew

the cavity cells is 0.901. In ICOOL the rf cavities were modeled using cylindrical pillboxes

running in the TM010 mode. The frequency is 201 MHz and the peak accelerating gradient
is 12 MV/m. The cavity operates at a synchronous phase 25◦ oﬀ the 0-crossing point. The

cavities are located in dipole ﬁelds. Since we are accelerating muons, the cavities can be

enclosed with metallic end windows in order to produce the maximum electric ﬁeld on-axis

for a given amount of rf power (maximum shunt impedance). The rf windows were stepped

in thickness radially, in order to provide minimum thickness near the beam axis and still

control the temperature increase due to rf heating.

The liquid hydrogen wedge absorbers have a house shape, as shown in Fig. 5, and are

located in dispersive regions in order to decrease the momentum spread in the beam.

FIG. 5: (Color) Wedge absorber used in some of the simulations.

The mean energy loss per cell in the absorber was 8.4 MeV. This energy loss was exactly

compensated by the rf cavities. The energy gain per cell is

(1)

where Ncav is the number of rf cavities per cell, Lcav is the length of each cavity, ˆG is the

peak rf gradient, T is the transit factor and φs is the synchronous phase.

The simulated absorber windows were planar and located axially just in front of and

behind the wedge itself.

In reality the window shape will conform to the shape of the

absorber and the eﬀect on the beam of scattering in the window should be lessened. Because

of the small bending ﬁeld we use a wedge with maximum possible opening angle, which has

zero thickness on one side. The wedge has a central thickness of 28 cm, a total wedge opening

8

angle of 100◦ and is rotated 30◦ from the vertical to match the maximum of the dispersion.

This combination of dispersion and wedge maximizes 6D emittance reduction.

III. LATTICE FUNCTIONS AND BEAM DYNAMICS

For our initial studies of the basic lattice functions and beam dynamics we consider the

ring with the magnetic ﬁeld present, but no rf or absorbers. This enables us to simply study

some of the basic features of the lattice, such as acceptances, beta function, closed orbits

and dispersion functions.

A. Acceptance

We ﬁrst examine the acceptance of the magnetic lattice as a function of momentum. A

series of particles with small deviations from the closed orbit were tracked through one cell

of the ring lattice. The eigenvalues were then extracted from the resulting linear transport

matrix. The magnitude and phase of the largest eigenvalue are shown in Fig. 6. The

has a very weak linear diﬀerence coupling resonance excited by the bend of the channel [14].

In practice this resonance is suppressed by the cooling.

We examined [9] the dynamic acceptance of the lattice, with no rf or absorber, for three

diﬀerent bending ﬁelds: 0.0 T, 0.125 T, and 0.25 T. Using ICOOL, particles were injected

into the lattice at 9 diﬀerent momenta and 6 diﬀerent angles. We found that the acceptance

was reduced as the bending ﬁeld was increased. We conclude that it is best to use the least

bending ﬁeld consistent with adequate emittance exchange.

B. Beta function

The left hand side of Fig. 7 shows the beta function as a function of position along a cell.

The beta function was determined by tracking a set of particles with small deviations from

the closed orbit through one cell of the magnetic lattice. Coupling between the transverse

directions was ignored. The minimum value of the beta function at the center of the absorber

(s = 0 in Fig. 7) and at the central momentum is about 38 cm.

The right hand side of Fig. 7 shows the beta function as a function of the muon beam

momentum. This also shows that the lattice transmits particles in the momentum band

160–250 MeV/c. These limits are determined by very strong π and 2π resonances at the

limiting momenta.

C. Closed orbits

Because of the symmetry of the magnetic ﬁeld, radial and vertical deviations of the closed

orbit must be even functions of s at any energy. This requires that their derivatives must

be 0 at the ends of the period. This makes it easier to search for closed orbits because

only variations in x0 and y0 need be considered. Muons were injected in the simulations

at the boundary of the cell (the absorber central plane), where the transverse momentum

vanishes for a closed orbit. For each initial (longitudinal) momentum, a unique closed orbit

was determined by scanning the plane, and ﬁnding the point to which the muon returns

every time it recrosses the absorber central plane. Since the magnetic ﬁeld has a small

radial component on-axis, the closed orbits are non-planar. The solid line in Fig. 8 shows

the transverse motion of the closed orbit for a 201 MeV/c muon. Note that the closed orbit

is oﬀset by about 11 mm in x and by about 17 mm in y at the beginning of the cell. Along
the cell x varies by ±6 mm and y varies by ±2 mm. The variation of the closed orbits for

changes in momentum are also shown in Fig. 8.

FIG. 8: Closed orbits in a cell–deviations from the central line of the ring in the radial direction

(left) and in the vertical direction (right). The diﬀerent line types correspond to orbits of diﬀerent

momentum muons: solid is for 201 MeV/c (reference particle), dotted, dashed, and dot-dashed are

for 170, 227, 248 MeV/c, respectively.

D. Dispersion function

Dispersion functions in x and y at the absorber central plane (and approximately the

absorber as a whole) can be derived from the closed orbits. One can see the linear depen-

dence of the y (vertical) oﬀset on the energy in Fig. 9. The dispersion at the absorber is
approximately 8 cm in a direction 30◦ from the y axis. The dispersion at the center of the

is surprisingly linear as a function of momentum, but the radial dispersion is not.

IV. COOLING SIMULATIONS: IDEAL RING

We now turn to simulations of muon beams in the ring. For cooling studies we must now

include the rf cavities and absorbers in the simulations.

Several merit factors have been deﬁned for quantifying cooling performance.

For the M-factor ǫ6N is the normalized 6D emittance and N(s) is the total number of

surviving muons at location s. For the D-factor, n(s) is the number of muons that are

contained in a ﬁxed transverse and longitudinal phase space acceptance volume V after

traversing a distance s. The M-factor is more relevant for a muon collider, while the D-

12

factor would be more applicable to a neutrino factory. The Q-factor is a local variable [23]

that compares the rate of change of the emittance to the particle loss.

We ﬁrst examine the performance of an ideal ring, ignoring for the moment additional

eﬀects due to windows on the absorbers and rf cavities and leaving empty space for in-

jection. Several important ring parameters are listed in Table II. ρ is the mean radius

where C is the circumference of the ring, E is the energy of the muons, β is the relativistic

velocity, e is the unit of charge, V is the peak rf voltage and φS is the synchronous phase.

Note that βS is much larger than the transverse beta function βT .

A reference particle was used to determine each cavity’s relative phase. The reference

particle is a muon that runs in a closed orbit and is used as a clock to determine the

rf frequency and set the entry times for each cavity in the ring. This clock satisﬁes the

following conditions:

• the revolution period is an integer multiple of the rf period

• the muon momentum is around 200 MeV/c.

In GEANT the closed-orbit muon that was chosen as the reference particle has a momentum

of 200.96 MeV/c. With a revolution period of 124.22 ns, its 25th harmonic is 201.26 MHz.

For the ICOOL runs we used a circular reference orbit.

13

Figure 10 shows the performance of the ideal ring as a function of distance. For the

simulations we use a Gaussian input beam with normalized transverse emittance of 12 mm

and normalized longitudinal emittance of 18 mm. The initial beam had a correlation between

the axial momentum and the transverse amplitude to minimize the tendency for the particles

in the bunch to spread out longitudinally in the solenoidal ﬁeld. The correlation causes the

average axial momentum to be larger than the reference momentum of 203 MeV/c.

of approximately 18.

We next consider the idealized ring behavior in terms of the muon density. Figure 11

shows the total muon transmission together with the muon density into two ﬁxed acceptance

volumes. These volumes correspond to the assumed acceptance of a linear accelerator that

follows the cooling ring. The idealized ring increases the muon density into the smaller

acceptance volume by a factor of almost 9 in 250 m, which corresponds to about 8 turns.

The density in the larger acceptance volume increases by about a factor of 6.

Figure 12 shows the radial and longitudinal phase space after 1 and 15 turns. The reduc-

tion of phase space area can be seen clearly in both distributions. The vertical transverse

acceptance. The emittance was calculated using the program ECALC9 [26, 27], which is a

standard tool used for this purpose. The agreement in calculated performance between the

two codes is excellent.

V. COOLING SIMULATIONS: REALISTIC RING

We now consider the eﬀects on performance of including windows for the absorbers and

rf cavities and leaving empty cells for injection. We refer to this as the realistic ring design.

Including windows introduces new sources of scattering and degrades the cooling perfor-

mance. We enclose the liquid hydrogen absorbers with aluminum windows. The rf cavities

have tapered beryllium windows. In general the M-factor is more sensitive to the presence

of windows than the D-factor. Two adjacent cells have the absorber and rf cavities removed

in order to leave space for the injection kicker, but the magnetic periodicity is maintained.

We show the inﬂuence of these eﬀects on the peak value of the D-factor in Table III.

The absorber window used in FS2 was 360 µm of aluminum. We see that windows of this

thickness degrade the performance by about 30%. For safety reasons it may be necessary to

use an additional window that increases the total amount of aluminum. On the other hand

the use of other special materials or optimized window shapes could reduce the amount of

material required. Another possibility would be to replace the liquid H2 absorber with a

solid material. LiH is one possible candidate, although Table III shows there is a 45% loss

of performance with this option.

In FS2 the Be end windows on the rf cavities were 200 µm thick from the axis out to a

radius of 12 cm, then 400 µm thick out to 18 cm. The interior windows were 700 µm thick

from the axis to a radius of 14 cm, then 1400 µm thick out to 21 cm. These rf windows

degrade the performance by about 35%. One possibility to get around this problem is to

operate the cavities at liquid nitrogen temperature. The lower operating temperature and the

reduced rf gradient of 12 MV/m versus 16 MV/m in FS2 allow the thickness of the windows

to be decreased by a factor of 4 with a performance loss of only 13%. An R&D program

on low-temperature windows might permit further reduction in the rf window thicknesses.

Alternatively, one could eliminate the rf cavity windows altogether and use an open cavity.

This has the disadvantage that four times more power is required to produce the same EZ

on axis, assuming that surface breakdown does not limit the axial ﬁeld available.

Introducing two empty cells for injection/extraction reduces the performance by 25%.

Finally, we consider an example that combines all of these eﬀects. We choose liquid H2 as

the absorber with 360 µm thick windows and no safety windows. We assume that operation

at liquid nitrogen temperature allows the thinner Be rf windows, and leave the empty cells

in the lattice for injection/extraction. Figure 14 shows the evolution of the D-factor for

the realistic ring. The initial phase space volume used in this simulation had a normalized

transverse acceptance of 9.75 mm and a normalized longitudinal acceptance of 35 mm. The

muon density into the accelerator acceptance peaks after about 10 turns. This realistic ring
model still gives an impressive increase in the accepted muon density of a factor of ≈ 4.5.

Figure 15 shows the evolution of the emittances and transmission for the realistic ring

design. Some of the transverse losses originate from particles that initially slip out of the rf

bucket. Following this there is a steady loss due to decays. Initially the x emittance falls

more rapidly than the y because it is the ǫN

y emittance that is mainly exchanged with the

longitudinal. But the Larmor rotations in the solenoids soon mix the x and y emittances,

bringing them close to a common value. The emittance performance of the realistic ring is

summarized in Table IV.

The mean angle of muons at the end of the channel was 66 mr and the maximum angle for

an accepted particle was 200 mr. This illustrates the advantage of using solenoidal focusing

for this application. Although the realistic ring merit factors are reduced considerably from

the ideal ring, where the corresponding merit factors were M = 120 and D = 8.9, the cooling

performance is still quite signiﬁcant.

VI. DESIGN ISSUES

There are a number of diﬃcult design issues that must be resolved before a real ring

cooler can be built. Each of the following areas needs a program of experimental R&D.

A. Beam injection and extraction

The design of the injection-extraction channels and kickers will be challenging. The 12-

fold symmetry of the ring must be broken to allow space for injection and extraction. In

some simulations two cells have been modiﬁed for this purpose, as shown in Fig. 16.

A more detailed layout of the injection area is shown in Fig. 17. The coils in the insertion

area have been modiﬁed to allow muons from an external beamline to access the kicker. It

is possible to generate magnetic ﬁelds in the insertion cells that are nearly identical to those

in the rest of the ring.

The minimum pulsed energy required for the kicker is proportional to the square of the

transverse emittance being kicked. Since the initial muon emittances discussed here are

much larger than those encountered in other applications, such as antiproton accumulation,

the energy in the pulsed kicker is three orders of magnitude greater, e.g. 10000 J here

compared with 10–20 J for the antiprotons. However, magnetic ampliﬁers used in induction

accelerators can provide this kind of pulse energy at the required pulse lengths, and a kicker

design based on this concept has been proposed [28].

B. Absorber heating

Using a ring for ionization cooling causes the beam bunches to pass through a given

absorber many times. This results in the thermal load on the absorber in a ring being much

larger than for the same absorber used in a linear channel. Consider the example shown

in Table V, which uses a 1 MW beam with similar parameters to FS2. The average power

and velocity in a typical pipe to extract the heat under steady state conditions.

C. RF windows

We have seen that the M-factor is very sensitive to the window thicknesses used in the

simulations. Figure 18 shows how the M-factor for an early ring design depends on the

rf window thickness. Thin windows are clearly advantageous, and we would like to use

VII. DESIGN VARIATIONS

discussed above.

A. 16.5 m circumference ring

We have also considered several variations of the 33 m circumference, 200 MHz ring

We have simulated [9] a case with twice the bending ﬁeld (0.25 T) and thus a ring

circumference of only 16.5 m. Such a ring would require an even shorter initial bunch train,

and is not expected to have as good a dynamic aperture. The transmission of an ideal ring

after 15 turns was 45%, the transverse normalized emittance was cooled from 10.8 to 3.6 mm,

the longitudinal normalized emittance was cooled from 51 to 5.2 mm, and the ideal M-factor

was 40. The greater dispersion allowed a greater reduction in longitudinal emittance at the

expense of less transverse cooling. The overall merit factor is not as good as the standard

ring.

B. 66 m circumference ring

A larger circumference ring would allow a longer bunch length of the initial beam and

would reduce problems with the injection kicker. The average vertical bending ﬁeld was

0.064 T. The transmission of an ideal ring after 15 turns was 49%, the transverse normalized

emittance was cooled from 11.9 to 2.0 mm, the longitudinal normalized emittance was

reduced from 19 to 6.1 mm, the M-factor was 60, and the D-factor was 5.2. The smaller

dispersion hurt the amount of longitudinal cooling and lowered the achievable merit factors.

C. 10 MHz ring

One solution to the problem of a long incoming bunch (train) is to reduce the rf frequency
to 10 MHz. Simulations of the 33 m ring were done using a gradient of 2 MV/m and 51◦

wedges. The transverse normalized emittance of an ideal ring was cooled from 18.6 to

2.9 mm, the longitudinal emittance was cooled from 251 to 79 mm and the M-factor was 61.

The transverse cooling was good, but the longitudinal cooling needs more dispersion. The

lower gradient was probably responsible for the slower cooling.

It is also possible to use open rf cavities in the ring. This eliminates the scattering in

the rf windows, but requires more rf power to achieve the same gradient. Simulations with

200 MHz open cavities in an ideal ring obtained the same performance as closed cavities

D. Open rf cavities

with 50 µm thick windows.

E. Cylindrical absorber

We studied the eﬀect of replacing the house shaped absorber with a more practical
cylindrical shape. Simulations for an ideal ring using a cylindrical analog to the 100◦ wedge

gave an M-factor of 109 compared to 152 for the house shape.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

Cooling large emittance muon beams is important for neutrino factories and absolutely

essential for a muon collider. Using a ring cooler geometry oﬀers likely economic advantages

in reusing expensive magnets, rf cavities and liquid hydrogen absorbers. A ring also provides

a natural mechanism for obtaining longitudinal cooling through emittance exchange. The

RFOFO ring cooler described here is at this time the most advanced ring cooler design. It

uses realistic ﬁeld modeling and takes into account the eﬀects of windows on the absorbers

and rf cavities and the eﬀects of empty cells for injection and extraction.

The ring can increase the muon density in a standard acceptance volume by over a factor

of 4. However, before such a ring could actually be built, a number of diﬃcult technical

issues, such as the injection kicker, need to be resolved through a program of experimental

R&D. An intensive R&D program on rf and absorber windows is presently underway as part

of the International Ionization Cooling experiment (MICE) [29].

Abstract
In this paper we introduce an optical approximation into the theory of impedance calculation, one
valid in the limit of high frequencies. This approximation neglects diﬀraction eﬀects in the radiation
process, and is conceptually equivalent to the approximation of geometric optics in electromagnetic
theory. Using this approximation, we derive equations for the longitudinal impedance for arbitrary
oﬀsets, with respect to a reference orbit, of source and test particles. With the help of the Panofsky-
Wenzel theorem we also obtain expressions for the transverse impedance (also for arbitrary oﬀsets).
We further simplify these expressions for the case of the small oﬀsets that are typical for practical
applications. Our ﬁnal expressions for the impedance, in the general case, involve two dimensional
integrals over various cross-sections of the transition. We further demonstrate, for several known
axisymmetric examples, how our method is applied to the calculation of impedances. Finally, we
discuss the accuracy of the optical approximation and its relation to the diﬀraction regime in the
theory of impedance.

INTRODUCTION

The calculation of the impedance for the elements of a vacuum chamber system and
the associated calculation of beam dynamics eﬀects, such as beam instabilities or wakeﬁeld
induced emittance growth, are important elements in the design of a modern accelerator.
Sophisticated computer programs are routinely used for such calculations, and in many cases
they can successfully treat complicated geometries, like those found in real vacuum systems.
There are, however, cases where the simulations are pushed to their limits in resource
requirements of both memory and cpu time, and in their ability to yield an accurate result.
One example is the case of very short bunches, like those envisioned in future linear
colliders and future light sources. For example, the ﬁnal bunch length in the current design of
the International Linear Collider (ILC) [1] is 300 microns; the ﬁnal (rms) bunch length in the
Linac Coherent Light Source [2] is 20 microns and in the European XFEL [3] it is 25 microns.
Since numerical calculation of the short-range wake requires a spatial mesh size equal to a
fraction of the bunch length, submillimeter bunches represent a challenging computational
task. Another example where direct numerical calculation is diﬃcult is related to long, small-
angle tapers which are often used to minimize the abruptness of vacuum chamber transitions.
For example, collimators with such tapers will be used in the post-linac collimation section of
the ILC. In such cases numerical solution of Maxwell’s equations requires a large number of
mesh points to fully cover the length of the transition or collimator. The diﬃculty becomes
especially pronounced for short bunches.

The diﬃculty in both examples mentioned above is associated with a small parameter.
For short bunches such a small parameter is the ratio of bunch length σz to typical size b
of the structure (in the vacuum chamber) that generates the impedance. If we denote by
λ the inverse wavenumber c/ω (c is the speed of light and ω the characteristic frequency
of interest) then λ ∼ σz, and the small parameter for the problem is λ/b.
It has long
been known that eﬀective utilization of this small parameter may allow one to simplify
the impedance problem, and several analytical results are available in the literature for the
impedance at high-frequencies. They include the impedance of a step transition [4, 5] and
the diﬀraction model for the impedance of a cylindrical pillbox cavity [6, 7, 8, 9]. More
recently, a parabolic equation method was developed that provides a simpliﬁed treatment of
diﬀraction eﬀects at high-frequencies [10].

In the case of diﬀraction theory, the calculation takes into account the fact that radiated
electromagnetic ﬁelds do not propagate along straight lines. A Fresnel type integral from
the diﬀraction theory of light is used to evaluate the electromagnetic energy that enters
into the cavity region [6, 7]. This energy is associated with the energy lost by the beam
and is thus related to the real part of the impedance. In this paper we will show that in
many cases the same kind of argument can be applied to the calculation of impedance in
an approximation that we call the optical approximation (or optical regime) in the theory
of impedance. In this approximation we assume that the electromagnetic ﬁelds carried by
a short bunch propagate along straight lines equivalent to rays in the geometric optics.
An obstacle inside the beam pipe can intercept the rays and reﬂect them away from their
original direction. The energy in the reﬂected rays is associated with the energy radiated
by the beam, which can then be related to the impedance. Note that this kind of argument
has been used in the past in the case of step-in and step-out transitions in a round pipe,
where the impedance was related to the energy “clipped away” from the beam by the step
[9, 11]. In a recent paper this approach has been extended and applied to the calculation of
impedance for 3D collimators [12].

If l is the length of an obstacle and b is the minimal cross-section size of the beam pipe,

2

the conditions for the optical approximation are

λ (cid:28) b ,

l (cid:28)

b2
λ

.

(1)

The ﬁrst of these two conditions requires the size of the obstacle be much larger than the
reduced wavelength of the radiation. The right hand side of the second inequality has a
meaning of the length over which diﬀraction eﬀects become signiﬁcant, and this relation
guarantees that such eﬀects give only a small correction to those of geometric optics. Note
that even a small-angle taper of angle θ ∼ b/l can be described in the optical approximation
for short enough bunches, if λ/b (cid:28) θ. The quantity b2/λ can also be interpreted as a catch-
up distance over which radiation, generated by the head of a beam, reﬂects from a side wall
of radius b and reaches the beam tail at length σz ∼ λ behind the head. Thus the second
condition of Eq. (1) for the applicability of the optical approximation is that the object is
short compared to the catch-up distance.

An analogous problem in geometric optics would be a body with transverse size b and
length l illuminated by light, see Fig. 1. The energy reﬂected by the body can be simply

FIG. 1: In geometric optics, light incident on a metallic object from the left is reﬂected by the
surface creating a shadow behind the object. The reﬂected light can be considered as radiation
emitted by the object due to currents induced in the metal by the incident electromagnetic ﬁeld.

calculated, in the optical approximation, as the energy incident upon the cross-sectional
area of the body. Such calculation, however, is only valid if the length of the obstacle l and
the transverse size b obey the second condition in Eq. (1). In the opposite limit (l (cid:29) b2/λ),
diﬀraction eﬀects become dominant.

In this paper we assume perfect conductivity in the vacuum chamber wall. Our goal is
to justify the optical approximation at high-frequencies and to demonstrate how one can
apply it to calculations of both the longitudinal and transverse geometric impedances. We
take two approaches to the problem. The ﬁrst one is based on the general energy balance
equation in electromagnetic theory, which relates the longitudinal impedance to the energy
radiated from a transition in a beam pipe. In the past, calculations of impedance based
on this relation were carried out by one of the authors in axisymmetric [13] as well as
rectangular [14] geometries. The derivation is similar to the approach developed in Ref. [15]
for the problem of laser acceleration in vacuum. As it turns out, in the most general case
of unequal oﬀsets of the leading and trailing particles, this approach gives the sum of the
longitudinal impedances symmetrized over the coordinates of the particles, which does not
provide enough information to obtain the transverse impedance for the transition. Our
second approach uses a so-called indirect integration method developed in Refs. [16, 17].
Although not as physically transparent as the energy balance method, this method—with
some reasonable assumptions regarding the formation length of the wake ﬁeld—gives a
simple expression for the longitudinal impedance in the most general case.

3

We want to emphasize here that although our result is not derived formally from ﬁrst
principles, it is based on a combination of exact consequences of Maxwell’s equations and
simple physical arguments that follow from the geometric optics. Our result is applicable to
an arbitrary three dimensional transition and allows the incoming and outgoing beam pipes
to have diﬀerent cross-sections. Practically important examples of impedance in the optical
regime are considered in a companion paper [18] where we also make a detailed comparison
with computer simulations and ﬁnd excellent agreement between the theory and simulations.
This report is organized as follows. In Section II we derive equations that relate the longi-
tudinal impedance to the integrals of the Fourier transformed Poynting vector over surfaces
located far from the transition. In Section III we calculate the contribution to the impedance
of the static ﬁelds carried by the charges while they are in the incoming and outgoing pipes
and far from the transition. The derivation in these two sections is general and does not
make any high-frequency assumptions. In Section IV the contribution to the impedance of
the radiation ﬁeld is computed in the optical approximation. In Section V we invoke the
indirect integration method to ﬁnd the wake ﬁeld for unequal oﬀsets of the particles. In
Section VI, using the Panofsky-Wenzel theorem, we derive expressions for the transverse
impedance in the optical approximation. Although our results for the transverse impedance
are applicable for arbitrarily large transverse oﬀsets, we further specialize them for the case
of the small oﬀsets usually assumed in practical applications. Example impedance calcu-
lations are given in Section VII where we compute both the longitudinal and transverse
impedances of a short, round collimator, and round step-in and step-out transitions. We
show that our results for these cases agree with known expressions found in the literature. In
Section VIII we discuss the relation between the optical regime and diﬀraction theory, and
establish the accuracy of the optical approximation. Finally, in Section IX we summarize
the main results of the paper.

We use Gaussian system of units throughout this paper; to convert impedances to MKS

units, one multiplies them by the factor Z0c/4π, with Z0 = 377 Ω.

II. LONGITUDINAL IMPEDANCE AND THE ENERGY RADIATED BY
CHARGED PARTICLES

It is well known that the real part of the longitudinal impedance is related to the energy
loss of the beam [19]. Since we assume perfect conductivity in the metallic walls, the losses
are due to the beam-induced radiation that propagates away from the transition. In this
section we derive a formula that relates the impedance to integrals of the ﬁeld over remote
surfaces far from the transition, and which is valid for a transition of general shape and
incoming and outgoing beam pipes of arbitrary cross-section.

We consider transitions between two beam pipes of cross-sections SA and SB, respectively,
as shown in Fig. 2. SA and SB are arbitrary, other than their axes are parallel to each other
and also parallel to the so-called design orbit of the beam. We let the design orbit, in turn,
deﬁne the z-axis. We assume that a charge q1 moves at oﬀset r1 = (x1, y1) with respect to
the design orbit, and a charge q2 moves at oﬀset r2 = (x2, y2) and at distance s behind (for
s > 0) the leading charge; both charges are assumed to move at the speed of light c. We
want to calculate the longitudinal wake w(cid:107)(r1, r2, s) given by

w(cid:107)(r1, r2, s) = −

E1,z(r2, z = ct − s, t)dt ,

(2)

where E1,z(r, z, t) is the z-component of the electric ﬁeld generated by the leading particle
at the position of the trailing one. The longitudinal impedance is related to the wake by

Let us denote the electric and magnetic ﬁelds of the leading charge by E1(r, z, t) and
H 1(r, z, t), and the electric and magnetic ﬁelds of the trailing charge by E2(r, z, t) and
H 2(r, z, t). The ﬁeld (E1, H 1) is due to the charge density of the ﬁrst particle, ρ1 =
q1δ(z − ct)δ(r − r1), and the ﬁeld (E2, H 2) is generated by the charge density of the second
particle, ρ2 = q2δ(z−s−ct)δ(r−r2). The total ﬁeld is the sum E = E1+E2, H = H 1+H 2.
Using the energy balance equation in electrodynamics [20] we can calculate the energy
lost by both charges by integrating the Poynting vector over remote boundaries SA and SB
located, respectively, far to the left of the incoming pipe and far to the right of the outgoing
pipe

Here n is the unit vector perpendicular to the surface area, and we use the short-hand
notation (cid:82)
for the sum of the integrals over SA and SB. In this equation the vector n
is oriented in the outward direction—it is parallel (antiparallel) to the z axis on SB (SA). A
positive value of W means that the charges lose energy. The contribution of such integrals
over the metallic surface of the pipes and the transition vanishes because we assume that
there are no losses in the wall. It follows from the energy balance equation that the radiated
energy given by Eq. (4) is equal to minus the energy change of both particles

The ﬁrst term in this equation is the energy loss of the leading particle, and the second
term is the energy loss for the trailing one. Note that strictly speaking the integration in
Eq. (5) should only be performed over the region between the surfaces SA and SB; however,
assuming that the surfaces are located suﬃciently far from the transition (to where the
interaction of the charges vanishes), we can extend the limits of integration to inﬁnity.

The electric ﬁeld at the location of the leading particle is equal to E1,z(r1, z = ct, t) +
E2,z(r1, z = ct, t), and the electric ﬁeld at the location of the trailing particle is E1,z(r2, z =

ct − s, t) + E2,z(r2, z = ct − s, t). We can cast the formula for W as follows:

W = q2

1U1 + q1q2U2 + q2

where

U1 = −

Since we assume that the particles move at the speed of light, due to causality the trailing
particle does not aﬀect the leading one. This means that E1,z(r2, z = ct − s, t) is not equal
to zero only if s > 0, and, similarly, E2,z(r2, z = ct, t) does not vanish only for s < 0. This
observation allows us to rewrite U2 as

U2 = h(s)w(cid:107)(r1, r2, s) + h(−s)w(cid:107)(r2, r1, −s) ,

where h(s) is the unit step function.

The next step is to take the Fourier transform in time, introducing the ﬁelds E and H,

.

Similarly, we also deﬁne the Fourier components E 1(r, z, ω) and H1(r, z, ω) for the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld of the ﬁrst charge. Because the ﬁelds E and H are real, we have the
relations

E(r, z, −ω) = E ∗(r, z, ω) ,

H(r, z, −ω) = H∗(r, z, ω) ,

(10)

with equivalent relations for E 1 and H1. The asterisk in these equations denote complex
conjugation. As for the Fourier components of the second charge, we deﬁne them in a way
that explicitly separates the phase factor introduced by the distance s between the particles:

We then have E = E 1 + eiωs/cE 2 and H = H1 + eiωs/cH2.

From the linearity of Maxwell’s equations it follows that the electromagnetic ﬁeld (E 1, H1)

is generated by the charge density ˆρ1 equal to the Fourier image of ρ1

Note that because of the extra phase factor e−iωs/c in the deﬁnition (11) the Fourier com-
ponents ˆρ1 and ˆρ2 are now “in phase”. Since ˆρ2 has the property ˆρ2(ω) = ˆρ∗
2(−ω), the ﬁelds
(E 2, H2) satisfy the same relations as Eqs. (10).

We will now prove that each of the three terms on the right hand side of Eq. (6) is equal
to the corresponding term in Eq. (15). The proof is based on the linearity of Maxwell’s
equations and the fact that expressions (6) and (15) are equal for arbitrary values of q1 and
q2. If q2 = 0, then there are only the ﬁrst terms in these two equations, hence they are
equal. If q1 = 0, then there are only the third terms, and they are also equal. Hence the
second terms must be equal, too. Using Eq. (8) we obtain

In the last integral we changed the integration variable ω → −ω in the second term of
the integrand and used the relations E 2(−ω) = E ∗

The quantity Z in this equation is the sum of the impedances symmetrized with respect to
the oﬀsets of the leading and trailing particles. If r1 = r2, then the left hand side is equal
to 2Z(cid:107)(r1, r1, ω) and this equation gives the longitudinal impedance for particles that have
the same oﬀset. However, for the general case of unequal oﬀsets, the equation gives only
the sum of the impedances Z.

Note that up to this point we did not use any approximation in our derivation—our result
is valid not only in the optical regime, but for arbitrary frequency ω. Eq. (17), relates the
sum of two longitudinal impedances to the interference term between the electromagnetic
ﬁelds of charges 1 and 2 in the energy ﬂow through the remote boundaries SA and SB. In
the next sections we will split the right hand side of Eq. (17) into several distinct parts and
then calculate the parts individually in the optical regime.

III. CONTRIBUTION TO IMPEDANCE OF STATIC AND RADIATION FIELDS

There are several contributions to the integral in Eq. (17). The ﬁrst one comes from
the ﬁeld that is carried by particles when they cross the surface SA on their way to the
transition, and the second one arises when they pass through the surface SB after leaving
the transition. We call these ﬁelds the static ﬁelds because they do not vary in time in the
beam frame and they can be calculated from a time independent system of equations after
a trivial change of variables z − ct → ζ in the laboratory frame. We emphasize here that
these are not radiation ﬁelds; nevertheless, they need to be included into the original energy
balance in Eq. (4).

We begin calculation of the static ﬁeld contributions from pipe A. The electric ﬁelds E 1,A

and E 2,A in the straight pipe can be represented in terms of the potential function φ,

E 1,A = −

eiωz/c∇φ1,A(r) ,

E 2,A = −

eiωz/c∇φ2,A(r) ,

(18)

q1
2πc

q2

where ∇ = ˆx ∂/∂x + ˆy ∂/∂y. The potential φ satisﬁes Poisson’s equation with source terms
given by the charge densities of Eqs. (12) and (13):

∇2φ1,A(r) = −4πδ(r − r1) ,

∇2φ2,A(r) = −4πδ(r − r2) ,

(19)

with boundary conditions φ1,A = φ2,A = 0 on the wall of pipe A. The magnetic ﬁeld in pipe
A is: H1,A = ˆz × E 1,A and H2,A = ˆz × E 2,A. We denote by ZA the contribution of these
ﬁelds, when integrated over the surface SA, to the integral Eq. (17)

(20)

The minus sign in this equation is due to the fact that the normal vector to SA is oriented
in the direction opposite to the z axis.

In the same way we calculate the contribution ZB to Eq. (17) from the remote boundary
SB. The electric ﬁeld on this surface E 1,B and E 2,B is given by the same equations (18) and
(19) with the index A replaced by B, and the boundary conditions for φ1,B and φ2,B being
zero on the metallic surface of beam pipe B. However, because the direction of the normal
vector to SB is along the z axis, ZB has a positive sign

ZB =

∇φ1,B · ∇φ2,B dS .

Note that, strictly speaking, the integrals in Eqs. (20) and (21) diverge because the ﬁeld
has a singularity at the location of charges q1 and q2. However in the sum ZA + ZB the
singular contributions cancel, and the result is ﬁnite.

In addition to the terms ZA and ZB there will be a contribution to the impedance due to
the radiation ﬁeld emitted in the transition region. We will denote this contribution Zrad,
so that

The quantity Zrad will be evaluated in the next section using the optical approximation.

Z = ZA + ZB + Zrad .

IV. RADIATION FROM THE TRANSITION IN THE OPTICAL APPROXIMA-
TION

In the optical regime the radiated energy has several terms. The ﬁrst term is the energy
that is radiated by reﬂection from the narrowing part of the pipe in the aperture area1 Sap
(see Fig. 2). We denote the cross-section of the transition that complements Sap to SA by
SA − Sap, and, similarly, the cross-section that complements Sap to SB by SB − Sap. The
incident energy ﬂux within this area will be “clipped away” from the beam and converted
into a radiation ﬁeld. This radiation may go in the backward direction if the narrowing
region is steep enough (e.g., a diaphragm, or a 90-degree, abrupt step-in pipe radius), or,
for a small-angle taper, it may go in the forward direction. Since the incident energy is the
static ﬁeld in pipe A, the contribution Zrad,1 of the clipped energy is given by the same
Eq. (20), but with the integration now carried out over the “clipping” area SA − Sap,

Zrad,1 =

∇φ1,A · ∇φ2,A dS .

(23)

(cid:90)

1
2πc

SA−Sap

The sign in this equation is positive because the radiation propagates from the transition
region to inﬁnity.

Through the aperture Sap connecting pipes A and B, charges carrying the static potential
φA enter into pipe B (for brevity, we momentarily drop indices 1 and 2). The ﬁelds will
eventually change in such a way that at a large distance from the transition the particles
will carry the potential φB.
In the course of this restructuring, there will be additional
radiation emitted in the forward direction. We denote the contribution of this radiation to
the impedance by Zrad,2 and calculate it in the following way. We represent the potential
of the charges immediately after passing through the aperture as a sum of the potential φB
occupying area SB, the potential −φB over the area SB − Sap, and the potential φA − φB
over the area Sap. From the linearity of Maxwell’s equations, the ﬁrst ﬁeld proceeds with
the charges as a new static ﬁeld in pipe B, and the last two transform into radiation. The
energy integral of the interference ﬁelds carrying this radiation is similar to Eqs. (20) and
(21) with the diﬀerence that over the area Sap one needs to use φA − φB, and outside of it,
the potential −φB:

Zrad,2 =

∇(φ1,A − φ1,B) · ∇(φ2,A − φ2,B) dS +

∇φ1,B · ∇φ2,B dS .

A slightly diﬀerent view of the derivation of Eqs. (23) and (24) is illustrated by Fig. 3.
According to this view, since the length of the transition is short [to satisfy Eqs. (1)], it can
be treated as an inﬁnitely short protrusion located at z = 0. The incident electromagnetic
ﬁeld in pipe A, given by potential φA, generates a radiation ﬁeld which will be reﬂected back
into pipe A. The radiation ﬁeld satisﬁes the boundary conditions φ = −φA on the left side of
the protrusion, at z = −0, indicated in Fig. 3. This condition follows from the requirement
that the tangential electric ﬁeld on the surface of the metal is zero. The boundary conditions
on the side of pipe B, at z = +0, are also indicated in the ﬁgure. The radiation ﬁeld that

following. Assume that the transition is illuminated by a set of parallel rays of light that propagate from
pipe A along the z axis. Then the cross-section of the illuminated area in pipe B gives Sap.

satisﬁes these boundary conditions, when summed with the static ﬁeld corresponding to
potential φB, gives a ﬁeld equal to zero on the metallic surface of the protrusion, and equal
to φA over the aperture Sap. The interference terms between the radiation ﬁelds of the ﬁrst
and the second charges lead to the integrals Eq. (23) and (24) on the left and the right side
of the transitions, respectively.

Collecting now all contributions in Eqs. (20), (21), (23) and (24) we arrive at the ﬁnal

where the ﬁrst integral is carried out over the cross-section of pipe B, and the second integral
over aperture Sap. Note that the impedance given by Eq. (25) is real and does not depend
on frequency ω.

As was emphasized above, the energy balance equation which was used to derive Eq.
(25) gives the summed impedance Z(cid:107)(r1, r2, ω) = Z(cid:107)(r2, r1, ω) + Z(cid:107)(r1, r2, ω), which is
symmetrized over the oﬀsets of the leading and trailing particles. This suﬃces to give us
the longitudinal impedance for the case when leading and trailing particles follow the same
path. However, for the transverse impedance (which we will discuss below) we will need
to ﬁrst ﬁnd Z(cid:107)(r1, r2, ω) alone (Z(cid:107) is not suﬃcient). To ﬁnd Z(cid:107)(r1, r2, ω) in the optical
approximation, we will, in the next section, invoke a more formal approach based on a
so-called indirect integration method.

V.

INDIRECT INTEGRATION METHOD

The indirect integration method developed in Refs. [16, 17] reduces the calculation of the
wake ﬁeld to the integration along a straight path up to some point z0 located in the exit
pipe B. The contribution from the remaining path z > z0 is expressed through the solution
of an auxiliary problem at the cross section z = z0.

By choosing z0 in pipe B immediately after the transition, we note that, in the optical
regime, the contribution of path z < z0 can be neglected. Indeed, the wake accumulates

10

over the catch up distance ∼ b2/λ, which, according to Eqs. (1), is much larger than the
transition length l. This observation greatly simpliﬁes the problem and allows us to compute
the impedance from the part of path with z > z0 only. This contribution is [16]

Esc

with the boundary condition Φ = 0 on the wall of pipe B. The quantity Esc
1 is (according
to the terminology of Ref.
[16]) the “scattered” electric ﬁeld of the leading charge—it is
obtained by subtracting from the total ﬁeld of this charge its static ﬁeld in pipe B. In Eq.
(27) we set z0 = 0 and suppress the argument r1 in the function Φ—the dependence on this
argument is clear from Eq. (27) where the electric ﬁeld E1,z is generated by the leading
particle moving with oﬀset r1.

We now transform Eq. (27) in a way that eliminates the longitudinal component Ez.

Using ∂Esc

where the symbol ⊥ refers to the components of the ﬁeld perpendicular to the z axis (we
also remind the reader that ∇ is a two-dimensional operator in the x − y plane).

Because we now use the time domain representation for the ﬁelds, we need to take the
inverse Fourier transform of Eq. (18) (and of a similar equation for pipe B) to ﬁnd the static
ﬁelds of the particle. This gives for E1

with the magnetic ﬁelds given by H 1,A = ˆz × E1,A and H 1,B = ˆz × E1,B.

The crucial step in the derivation is to notice that, in the optical regime, after passage
through the transition region, the static ﬁeld of particle 1 is “scraped oﬀ” outside the
aperture Sap. The ﬁeld left with the charge is equal to E1,A but only within the area of
Sap (the ﬁeld in SB − Sap is zero). To ﬁnd the scattered ﬁeld we need to subtract from the
“truncated” ﬁeld E1,A the static ﬁeld E1,B of charge 1 in pipe B, which gives

We substitute Eqs. (30) and (31) into Eq. (28) and use the result as the right hand side in
Eq. (27) for Φ. It follows from Eq. (31) that (∇ × H sc

It is easy to see that this impedance is consistent with the symmetrized formula Eq. (25).

VI. TRANSVERSE IMPEDANCE AND SMALL OFFSET OF PARTICLES

Knowledge of the longitudinal impedance allows one to compute the transverse impedance
using the Panofsky-Wenzel theorem [22]. In the general case, the transverse impedance is
represented by a vector Z⊥ perpendicular to the particle’s orbit, and is given by

Z⊥ =

∇r2Z(cid:107) ,

where ∇r2 is the operator “nabla” that diﬀerentiates with respect to the coordinates r2 of
the trailing particle, ∇r2 = ˆx ∂/∂x2 + ˆy ∂/∂y2, with ˆx and ˆy being the unit vectors in x
and y directions2.

In applications, it is typically assumed that there is a symmetry axis in the system and
the beam has a small oﬀset relative to this axis compared to the transverse size of the pipe.
In this case, one can expand the impedance in Taylor series. The leading terms in the
transverse impedance in this case are linear in oﬀsets of the leading and trailing particles3.
We will now derive expressions for the transverse impedance in this approximation.

For small oﬀsets of the leading and trailing particles we can expand the delta functions

in Eqs. (19)

δ(r − r1) ≈ δ(r) − r1 · ∇δ(r) +

(r1 · ∇)2δ(r) ,

1 = −2π(r1 · ∇)2δ(r) ,

∇2φ(d)
∇2φ(q)

2 = 4πr2 · ∇δ(r) ,
2 = −2π(r2 · ∇)2δ(r) .

Representation (39) generates many terms in Eq. (36). The linear term in r2 after sub-
stitution into the Panofsky-Wenzel Eq. (37) gives rise to a transverse impedance which
corresponds to a kick on particle 2 when both particles travel along the reference orbit with-
out oﬀset. We will call this impedance the transverse monopole impedance and denote the
corresponding longitudinal impedance by Z(cid:107),m, where

In many practical cases the structure geometry has both up-down and right-left symmetry
and the design orbit is on the symmetry line.
In such a case the transverse monopole
impedance vanishes. The longitudinal impedance which gives the usual transverse wake
then has a term that is proportional to the product of vector components of r2 and r1 and
one that is quadratic in r2 (no dependence on r1). According to accepted terminology, we
will call the former (in the case of impedance) the dipole component, Z(cid:107),d, and the latter
the quadrupole component, Z(cid:107),q. The total impedance, the sum of the two components, is
given by

Z(cid:107) = Z(cid:107),d + Z(cid:107),q ,

Note that for the special case of cylindrically symmetric structures the quadrupole compo-
nent is identically equal to zero.

transverse impedance for a transition of arbitrary geometry.

VII. EXAMPLE IMPEDANCE CALCULATIONS IN THE OPTICAL REGIME

In this section we will show how to calculate the longitudinal and transverse impedances

for several simple cases of axisymmetric systems using results of Section VI.

We ﬁrst calculate the longitudinal impedance for a short, round collimator shown in
Fig. 4a, with pipe radius a and collimator radius b (b < a). In this case both charges are

FIG. 4: A short collimator (a), a step-in (b), and a step-out (c) transition in axisymmetric geometry.
The particles move in the +z direction. For the collimator a denotes the pipe radius and b the
collimator radius, with b < a. For the step transitions, a denotes the radius of the incoming pipe
and b the radius of the outgoing pipe, with b < a for the step-in and b > a for the step-out transition.

located on the axis of the pipe, and the solution to Eqs. (19), in cylindrical coordinates, is

−2 ln(r/a) and −2 ln(r/b) for pipes of radius a and b, respectively. However, for the step-in
transition, the cross-section SB coincides with Sap, and the two integrals in Eq. (35) cancel,
giving a total impedance of zero. For a step-out transition, the diﬀerence of these integrals
is the same as given by the ﬁrst line in Eq. (46), and the impedance is equal to that of a
collimator with the aperture equal to the radius of pipe B. Again, both these results are
known in the literature, and we have derived them here to demonstrate that the optical
approximation agrees with previously obtained results.

For the transverse impedance of a round collimator and a step-in and a step-out transition
we ﬁrst note that only the dipole term in Eq. (42) contributes to the impedance. The
quadrupole term in this equation vanishes because the monopole potential φ(m) in Eq. (44)
has no angular dependence while the quadrupole potential φ(q) has an angular dependence
∝ cos 2θ (here θ is the azimuthal angle in cylindrical coordinates).

For a round collimator, pipe A and pipe B have the same radius a, hence, φ(d)

1,A = φ(d)

DIFFRACTION REGIMES

Let us consider now the pillbox cavity shown in Fig. 5. Diﬀraction theory gives the

(cid:114)

The optical theory predicts zero impedance for the pillbox cavity. Indeed, in this case,
all the three cross-sections SA, Sap and SB are equal (regarding the determination of Sap
in this case see the footnote on page 9), and Eq. (35) immediately gives a zero result. The
reason for the optical approximation not reproducing the result of the diﬀraction theory is
that Eq. (61) corresponds to the next order approximation in the small parameter λl/b2,
which is beyond the applicability limit of the optical regime. Indeed, if we take the ratio of
the impedance Eq. (61) to a typical optical impedance Z(cid:107),optical ∼ 1/c [see, e.g. Eq. (46)],
we obtain

Z(cid:107),diﬀraction

Hence the parameter (cid:112)lλ/b2 indicates the accuracy of the optical approximation: one can
expect that corrections to the optical regime due to diﬀraction eﬀects will be on the order
of this parameter4.

Note that one can ﬁnd in the literature references to the impedance of the collimator
given by Eq. (46) as a diﬀraction impedance (the authors of this paper have also used
this terminology in the past). The terminology introduced in this paper distinguishes the
optical regime from the diﬀraction regime, and we believe that it better describes the physics
involved.

(61)

(62)

4 For the geometries considered in Section VII, the length parameter l should be deﬁned as l ∼ b, and the

accuracy of the optical approximation is on the order of pλ/b.

IX. CONCLUSION

In this paper we have introduced an optical approximation into the theory of impedance
calculation, valid in the limit of high frequencies. This approximation neglects diﬀraction
eﬀects in the radiation process, and is conceptually equivalent to the approximation of
geometric optics in electromagnetic theory. Using this approximation, we have derived
equations for the longitudinal impedance for arbitrary oﬀsets of the source and test particles
with respect to a reference orbit. With the help of the Panofsky-Wenzel theorem we have
also obtained expressions for the transverse impedance (also for arbitrary oﬀsets). We
further simpliﬁed these expressions for the case of the small oﬀsets that are typical for
practical applications. Our ﬁnal expressions for the impedance, in the general case, involve
two dimensional integrations over various cross-sections of the transition.

We have, in addition, demonstrated for several simple examples how our method is applied
to the calculation of impedances for simple axisymmetric geometries that have been studied
in the past. Finally, we discussed the accuracy of the optical approximation and its relation
to the diﬀraction regime in the theory of impedance.

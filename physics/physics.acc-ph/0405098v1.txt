Abstract

In the beam pipe of the positron damping ring
of the Next Linear Collider, electrons will be cre-
ated by beam interaction with the surrounding
vacuum chamber wall and give rise to an electron
cloud. Several solutions are possible for avoiding
the electron cloud, without changing the bunch
structure or the diameter of the vacuum cham-
ber. Some of the currently available solutions for
preventing this spurious electron load include re-
ducing residual gas ionization by the beam, min-
imizing beam photon-induced electron produc-
tion, and lowering the secondary electron yield
(SEY) of the chamber wall. We will report on
recent SEY measurements performed at SLAC
on TiN coatings and TiZrV non-evaporable get-
ter thin ﬁlms.

INTRODUCTION
Beam-induced multipacting, which is driven
by the electric ﬁeld of successive positively
charged bunches, arises from a resonant mo-
tion of electrons that were initially generated by
photon, gas ionization or by secondary emission
from the vacuum wall. These electrons move res-
onantly along the surface of the vacuum chamber,
occasionally getting ”kicked” by the circulating
beam to the opposite wall. The electron cloud ef-
fect (ECE), due to this multipacting, has been ob-
served or is expected at many storage rings. The
space charge of the cloud, if sufﬁcient, can lead
to a loss of the beam or, at least, to a drastic re-
duction in luminosity. In order to minimize the
electron cloud problem which might arise in the
NLC, we are looking to solutions involving sur-
face coating of the secondary electron emitting
vacuum wall.

EXPERIMENT DESCRIPTION
AND METHODOLOGY

The system and methodology used to mea-
sure the secondary electron yield has been de-
scribed thoroughly in reference [1]. The system
is composed of two coupled stainless steel UHV
chambers where the pressure is in the low 10−10
Torr scale in the measurement chamber and high
10−9 Torr scale in the ”load lock” chamber, Fig.1.
Samples individually screwed to a carrier plate,
are loaded ﬁrst onto an aluminium transfer plate
in the load lock chamber, evacuated to the low
10−8 Torr scale, and then transferred to the mea-
surement chamber.

Figure 1: Experimental system used for SEY
measurements and surface analysis

One sample at a time is measured in the mea-
surement chamber, by placing it on a dedicated
support, Fig.2. Sample temperature can be moni-
tored by the use of two thermocouples, and chem-
istry by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).
In the case of a non-evaporable getter (NEG)
sample, thermal activation of the layer is pro-
vided by electron bombardment to the back of the
sample.

SEY measurements were made with a Keith-
ley 6487, a high resolution picoameter with inter-
nal ±505 V supply and IEEE-488 interface. The
6487 has several ﬁlter modes which were turned
off for our measurements. The integration time
for each current reading is set to 167 microsec,
which is the minimum value for the instrument.
The current for each primary energy step was
sampled one hundred times; the mean and stan-
dard deviation were returned from the picoameter
to the computer.

RESULTS & COMMENTS
As also shown in reference [1] for TiN/Al; the
SEY of TiN/SS (TiN coated on stainless steel)
has a spread, see Fig.3. The process used to coat
them is described in reference [3]. The spread
in the δmax can be hypothesized as depending on
contamination, roughness, and nitrogen pressure
[4]. Contamination and stoichiometry determi-
nation, of the samples, were obtained by XPS, cf
Table.1.

Results, for a series of processes, from a
T i30Zr18V52, at%, NEG coated on SS substrates
are shown in Fig.4. Initially, the sample was mea-
sured ”as received”, then after a ﬁrst activation
at 210◦C for 2 hours. The sample is then left in
the measurement chamber for 145 days at a pres-
sure below 10−9 Torr, N2 equivalent. The system
was then exposed frequently to the unbaked vac-
uum of the load lock chamber of a few 10−9 Torr.
The next step was bombardment of the sample
by electrons of kinetic energy 130 eV. Results of

secondary emission yield

Calculation of the SEY (δ) is done via the

equation in Fig.2

where IP is the primary lectron gun current im-
pinging on the sample and IT is the total current
measured on the sample (IT = IP + IS). IS is the
secondary electron current leaving the sample.

It is important to not look at the SEY at low pri-
mary energy and try to conclude something about
elastic reﬂectivity. Data below 20 eV comes
from a band structure and are a combination of
diffraction from the crystalline structure and en-
ergy absorption by the material [2]. Surface ef-
fects such as roughness, angles of incidence of
the primary electron and chemistry on the surface
inﬂuence the SEY of a material. More details on
the methodology can be found in reference [1]

this electron surface conditioning are shown in
Fig.5. This conditioning effect is also observed
for the TiN/Al and TiN/SS samples, Fig.5. The
NEG sample is then left in vacuum for 34 days
before being thermally reactivated at 210◦C for
2 hours. Effects of the recontamination by this
residual vacuum below 10−9 Torr on the δmax, for
the TiN and NEG samples after these different
processes, are shown in Fig.6.

Figure 6: SEY max during recontamination in a
vacuum of few 10−10 Torr

δ increased from ∼1.2 to ∼1.4 after forty days of
exposure to a vacuum of ∼5.10−10 Torr. The sec-
ond set of data after activation agree with CERN
measurements[5]. Gas-saturated and conditioned
NEG seems to not have a δmax above 1.4. Con-
ditioning the NEG with a 130 eV electron beam
leads to a δmax of 1.3, after a dose of 1 mC/mm2.
The inﬂuence of electron conditioning has been
shown for the TiN on SS or Al substrate. Val-
ues of δmax, reached at a dose of 1 mC/mm2, are
1.1 for both samples. Recontamination does not
degrade the SEY dramatically, Fig.6.

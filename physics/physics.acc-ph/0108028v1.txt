Abstract

A program is underway to develop liquid-hydrogen en-
ergy absorbers for ionization cooling of muon-beam trans-
verse emittance. Minimization of multiple-scattering-
induced beam heating requires thin windows. The ﬁrst win-
dow prototype has been destructively tested, validating the
ﬁnite-element-analysis model and the design approach.

INTRODUCTION

High-energy stored muon beams may allow uniquely
sensitive studies of neutrino physics as well as compact
lepton colliders for the study of the Higgs boson(s), su-
persymmetry, and the energy frontier [1, 2]. An important
technique for the creation of such beams is ionization cool-
ing [3, 4], by which the transverse emittance of the initially-
diffuse muon beam can be quickly reduced to dimensions
commensurate with the acceptances of recirculating accel-
erators. Simulations show that enough transverse cooling
can be achieved to build a neutrino factory [5, 6]. We report
here on recent progress in constructing prototype energy
absorbers for muon-beam ionization cooling.

The Muon Collaboration (working with many additional
physicists and engineers) has completed its second feasi-
bility study of a neutrino factory based on a muon stor-
age ring. The Feasibility Study II (FS2) report [5] de-
scribes a design that could be built for a well-deﬁned cost,
and that would deliver a ﬂux of neutrinos for long-baseline
neutrino-oscillation studies six times higher than that of the
previous design iteration [7]. Our next goals are to com-
plete the designs for key muon-cooling components, build
and test prototypes, and use them to carry out a ﬁrst exper-
imental demonstration of muon ionization cooling.

2 ENERGY ABSORBERS FOR

IONIZATION COOLING

Ionization cooling involves the damping of the muons’
random transverse motions by ionization energy loss in an
energy-absorbing medium; energy lost in the longitudinal
direction is replaced via RF acceleration. From Eq. 1 [3, 4],
maximizing the cooling rate dǫn/ds requires minimizing
the deleterious effects of Coulomb scattering in the ab-
sorbers by constructing them out of a material with a long
radiation length (LR) and embedding them in a focusing

where muon energy Eµ is in GeV, ǫn is normalized emit-
tance, and s is path length. In an optimized design the fo-
cusing is provided by superconducting solenoids and the
absorber is liquid hydrogen (LH2) [8].

The FS2 design includes absorbers of three types, as
speciﬁed in Table 1. The large transverse dimensions of
the muon beam require large apertures and correspondingly
wide absorbers, while the large energy spread of the beam
demands frequent rebunching via RF cavities, favoring thin
absorbers. These two requirements lead to the slightly
oblate shapes of the “SFOFO” absorbers implied in Table 1
and shown in Fig. 1.

2.1 Absorber Windows

LH2 containment requires a vessel with closed ends
(windows) through which the muons must pass. A prac-
tical design choice for the windows is aluminum alloy.1
Simulations show that scattering in the absorber windows
degrades muon-cooling performance. To keep this effect to
a minimum, the FS2 design calls for window thicknesses
as given in Table 2. (Note that in the long “minicooling”
absorbers, scattering is dominated by the hydrogen itself
and thus the windows are not at issue).

Since the SFOFO absorbers are wider than they are long,
hemispherical windows (which would be thinnest at a given
pressure) are ruled out, and we are led to the “torispherical”
window shape. As speciﬁed by the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers (ASME) [9], the torispherical head
for pressure vessels is composed of a central portion having
a radius of curvature (the “crown radius”) equal to the di-
ameter of the cylindrical portion of the vessel, joined to the

1Beryllium or a beryllium-containing alloy might be a superior choice,

but beryllium has a questionable safety record in LH2 applications.

For an ASME-standard torispherical window, the re-

where P is the pressure differential, D the length of the
major axis (i.e. the absorber diameter), S the maximum al-
lowable stress, and E the weld efﬁciency. For S, we fol-
low ASME recommendations and use the smaller of 1/4 of
the ultimate strength Su or 2/3 of the yield strength Sy.2
For 1.2-atm operation, and given the ASME speciﬁcation
for 6061-T6 aluminum alloy,3 Su =289 MPa, we obtain
t ≥ 530 µm for the “SFOFO 1” absorbers and t ≥ 330 µm

2In practice, for aluminum alloys, the ultimate strength provides the

more stringent limit.

36061-T6 is the standard aluminum alloy for cryogenic applications,
however more exotic high-strength alloys may also be suitable and are
under investigation.

for the “SFOFO 2” absorbers, where the “>” sign applies
if the window is welded to its mounting ﬂange (E < 1).
However, to reach the smaller window thicknesses given in
Table 2, we have devised a design in which each window is
machined out of a single block of material, with an integral
ﬂange (with no welds, E = 1), and the window thickness is
tapered (based on ﬁnite-element analysis) to improve struc-
tural strength (Fig. 2).

2.2 Window Prototype

We have built and tested a ﬁrst prototype window of the
above design. To test the limits of the proposed manufac-
turing technique, we speciﬁed a central thickness of only
130 µm, with a radius of 15 cm. The window was built
on a CNC milling machine and CNC lathe at the Univ.
of Mississippi. After one face was machined, a custom-
built backing jig was used to support it while the other face
was cut. The window was then measured using a preci-
sion coordinate-measuring machine at Fermilab and with
micrometers and found to be within 5% of the nominal
thickness proﬁle (Fig. 3), validating the design approach
and manufacturing procedure.

2.3 Pressure Tests

To be certiﬁed as safe for liquid-hydrogen containment
at Fermilab, the vessel must undergo a stringent safety re-
view. The requirements include destructive testing of ﬁve
windows of a given design before a sixth window may be
put into service. The ﬁrst prototype was pressure-tested in

a setup in which the window, with 22 strain gages afﬁxed
at strategically-chosen points on its surface, was mounted
to a back plate, the volume thereby enclosed being ﬁlled
with water. The water was then pressurized to varying de-
grees with air and the resulting strains read out to a PC
via a scanning DVM and 22 ADC channels. Additional
measurements included the pressure, the volume of water
contained, and precision photogrammetric measurements4
of the shape of the window surface. Detailed compari-
son of these measurements with the predictions of a ﬁnite-
element-analysis model will allow the design and fabrica-
tion procedures to be certiﬁed for future windows of vari-
ous sizes and thicknesses.

Summarized brieﬂy, at the present stage of analysis, the
agreement between the photogrammetric measurements
and the strain-gage data is good, with typical discrepan-
cies below 10%. The window-failure mode was somewhat
surprising: while the onset of inelastic deformation was

ing of strain. We are not aware of its prior use for such a purpose. Contact
measurements are undesirable since the gluing on of strain gages is labor
intensive and (especially with such a thin foil) may bias the measurement.

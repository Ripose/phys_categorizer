Abstract

In this paper we present several techniques for characterizing longitudinal impedances based on transient mea-
surements of the growth rates and tune shifts of unstable coupled-bunch modes. These techniques are appli-
cable to measurement of both fundamental and higher-order mode impedances and allow characterization of
shunt impedances and quality factors of the HOMs. Methods presented here are complementary to lab bench
measurements of RF cavities, in that the beam based measurements directly sense the physical impedance in
the installed conﬁguration. In contrast to a single-bunch integrated impedance measurement these techniques
resolve the impedances in the frequency domain. These methods allow determination of the impedance’s una-
liased frequency by analyzing synchronous phase transients. Experimental results from ALS and BESSY-II are
presented showing the use of these techniques to measure complex impedances.

the frequency domain. These methods allow determination
of the impedance’s unaliased frequency by analyzing syn-
chronous phase transients. Experimental results from ALS
and BESSY-II are presented showing the use of these tech-

INTRODUCTION

The interaction of charged particles in a storage ring or
circular accelerator with the ring impedance determines
many important accelerator dynamics parameters. Sin-
gle and multi-bunch instabilities are the result of interac-
tions of the bunches with the impedance of the machine,
and achieving high stored currents requires knowledge and
control of the ring components which produce the domi-
nant narrow-band impedances. There are several labora-
tory techniques to measure impedances of physical com-
ponents [1, 2]. Beam-based impedance measurement tech-
niques exist as well. Frequency-resolved information about
the coupling impedance can be extracted from a measure-
ment of the beam transfer function (BTF) [3]. However
such a measurement can only be performed below the in-

have to be repeated for each unstable mode making BTF
approach slow and cumbersome.

This paper presents several beam-based longitudinal
impedance measurement techniques. These fast transient
multi-bunch techniques measure the aliased longitudinal
impedance as a function of frequency in a sampling band-
width up to 1/2 the RF frequency. Consequently various
higher-order mode resonators can be identiﬁed and their
complex impedance (and parameters such as center fre-

2 LONGITUDINAL IMPEDANCES AND
COUPLED-BUNCH INSTABILITIES

Bunches of charged particles passing through the vac-
uum chamber of a storage ring leave behind electromag-
netic ﬁelds. These ﬁelds (wake ﬁelds) affect the energy
of the following bunches providing a bunch-to-bunch cou-
pling mechanism. At high beam currents such coupling can
cause instabilities.

The bunch motion in a storage ring can be projected onto
the orthonormal basis of the even ﬁll eigenmodes (EFEMs).
Eigenvalue of mode l is given by [4]

where dr is the radiation damping rate, ωs is the syn-
chrotron frequency, α is the momentum compaction factor,
e is the charge of the electron, frf is the frequency in the
accelerating cavities, I0 is the beam current, E0 is the beam
energy, h is the ring harmonic number, ω0 is the revolution
frequency, and Z k(ω) is the total longitudinal impedance.
In order to measure modal eigenvalues Λ we use the
capabilities of a programmable longitudinal feedback sys-
tem [5]. The system is able to measure the unique syn-
chronous phase and centroid motion of every bunch in a
storage ring, and uses digital memory to record time se-
quences of the bunch motion.
In a transient grow/damp
measurement feedback loop is opened under software con-
trol for a predetermined period of time and then closed. In
the open-loop conditions unstable modes grow exponen-
tially due to noise and feedback system records the motion
of the bunches during the transient. The motion is then pro-
jected on the EFEM basis and modal exponential growth
and damping rates as well as oscillation frequencies are ex-
tracted [6]. Once the eigenvalues are measured it is possi-
ble to extract the aliased impedance according to Eq. 1. The
aliased beam-derived impedance, combined with knowl-
edge about the impedances from bench measurements of
ring components may be properly assigned as an unaliased
impedance.

3 SYNCHRONOUS PHASE TRANSIENTS

ALS main RF cavity 2

For the cases when ring ﬁll pattern is uneven additional
information about the impedance can be obtained from an-
alyzing the dependence of synchronous phases on bunch
currents. Previous work by Prabhakar [7] presents the rela-
tionship between the bunch currents, impedances, and syn-
chronous phases. This work is applicable to ﬁll patterns
where all buckets are populated, however unevenly. For
empty buckets synchronous phase is not measurable. Ex-
tending the analysis to ﬁlls with empty buckets (gaps) we
get

where ~φ is the vector of bunch phases, U is the set that
includes all non-empty buckets, Vc is the peak RF cavity
voltage and φ0
s is the synchronous phase in absence of wake
ﬁelds. Matrix AUV is computed using inverse DFT (Dis-
crete Fourier Transform) matrix and a DFT of the vector of
individual bunch currents. Set V includes revolution har-
monics excited by the DFT of bunch currents. By solving
an overdetermined linear system of equations described by
Eq. 3 in the least-squares sense we obtain ~Z †
V .

4 ALS MEASUREMENTS

The goal of the ﬁrst measurement is to quantify the HOM
impedances of the two 500 MHz main RF cavities installed
at the ALS. Past measurements have determined that there
are two dominant EFEMs, modes 205 and 233, excited by
the impedances in the main RF cavities [8]. Using the
measurements made on the spare cavity identical to the
ones installed in the ring mode 205 had been identiﬁed
as driven by the T M011 longitudinal mode at 812 MHz.
Mode 233 has two potential driving HOMs, at 2.353 GHz
and 2.853 GHz [2].

Due to technical limitations it is only possible to ﬁll
320 RF buckets at the ALS. All of the transient measure-
ments described here were taken with 320 buckets maxi-
mally equally ﬁlled leaving a gap of 8 RF buckets. Since
the gap is small we assume that eigenmodes of the ﬁll are
very close to those of an even-ﬁll.

In order to characterize the frequency dependence of the
impedance we shifted the center frequencies of the cavity
HOM resonances by changing the temperature of the cav-
ity. At each point the temperature was allowed to stabi-
lize and the open-loop eigenvalues of the unstable modes
were measured using the transient grow-damp technique.
In Fig. 1 the growth rates and oscillation frequencies of
modes 205 and 233 are plotted versus temperature of cav-
ity 2.

These measurements agree well with the expected effect
of the HOM resonators. However these measurements do

not provide a way to distinguish between the two possible
HOMs at 2.353 and 2.853 GHz as the source of the aliased
impedance. To resolve this ambiguity the ring was ﬁlled
with a single bunch while a cavity probe signal was moni-
tored on a spectrum analyzer. We observed that change of
cavity temperature had very small effect on the magnitude
of the revolution harmonics excited within the 2.353 GHz
resonance while signal at 2.853 GHz scaled with temper-
ature in agreement with the growth rate measurements.
Thus the resonance measured in the temperature scan is at
2.853 GHz.
In addition the impedance presented by the
2.353 GHz HOM can be considered constant.

In order to quantify impedance parameters Rs and Q we
convert cavity temperatures to center frequencies of the res-
onance. Conversion factor is determined by matching cav-
ity probe signal levels between two temperatures and two
RF frequency settings. Using nonlinear least-squares es-
timation we extract parameter values.
In Table 1 results
for both cavities are summarized. Note that characteristics
of the 2.853 GHz resonances in two cavities differ signiﬁ-
cantly. The cavities have RF windows of different designs
which can cause variations in the R/Q values. Addition-
ally, the mode in question is close to the beam pipe cut-off
frequency and is strongly affected by the ﬁeld leakage.

Using growth rates vs. RF cavity temperature results

2

it is possible to optimize operating temperatures of the
main RF cavities. Since temperatures affect the transverse
impedances as well as longitudinal impedances, mapping
growth rates in horizontal and vertical planes is necessary
for a full understanding of the tradeoff.

5 BESSY-II MEASUREMENTS

These measurements were aimed at quantifying longi-
tudinal impedances at BESSY-II. The machine was ﬁlled
with 350 consecutive bunches out of 400 to a current of
165 mA. A series of 15 transient grow/damp experiments
was conducted over a period of 10 minutes during which
the machine conﬁguration remained unchanged. There are
three unstable EFEMs seen in the data: 281, 396, and 397.
Using Eq. 1 we extract complex longitudinal impedances
from the measured growth rates and oscillation frequen-
cies.

Impedance measurement for modes 396 and 397 corre-
lates well with the impedance of four third harmonic cav-
ities parked between 3 and 4 revolution harmonics below
3frf .

As described in Sec. 3 we can estimate the impedance
by analyzing the synchronous phase transient.
In Fig. 2
synchronous phase transient in BESSY-II is presented with
350 consecutive buckets ﬁlled nearly equally. Periodic
pulse excitation of the ﬁll pattern generates oscillatory be-
havior of the synchronous phases. Solving Eq. 3 in the
least-squares sense we obtain aliased impedances. Least-
squares estimate of the synchronous phases is also shown
in Fig. 2 for comparison with experimental data. Using
15 BESSY transient measurements described above we
get Z †
396 = (35 ± 22) + (344 ± 14)j kΩ and Z †
397 =
(22 ± 6) − (233 ± 15)j kΩ.

The two methods of measuring the impedance can be
used together in order to determine unaliased frequencies.
This is possible due to the fact that during aliasing into
Z kef f impedance is scaled by resonant frequency, while
in Z † it is unscaled. From Eq. 2 we have

Since p in Eq. 4 is an integer by deﬁnition, compar-
ison above indicates that the physical impedance is at
2ωrf + 396ω0 = 3ωrf − 4ω0. This conclusion agrees
perfectly with the expected position of the parked third-
harmonic cavities.

6 SUMMARY

We have demonstrated several methods for measuring
the impedance of accelerator components using transient
diagnostic capabilities of the DSP-based longitudinal feed-
back systems. The methods extend the capabilities of lab-
oratory bench measurements by quantifying the physical
impedances as installed in the accelerator. Dependence of
the impedances on operating conditions such as tempera-
ture or tuner position can be extracted and used to select op-
timal working points. By comparing information obtained
from growth transients with the analysis of the synchronous
phase transients for uneven ﬁlls it is possible to determine
the spectral position of the driving impedance.

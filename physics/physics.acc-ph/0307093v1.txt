Abstract

This paper describes an eﬀective frequency doubler scheme for SASE free electron
lasers. It consists of an undulator tuned to the ﬁrst harmonic, a dispersion section,
and a tapered undulator tuned to the second harmonic. The ﬁrst stage is a conven-
tional soft X-ray SASE FEL. Its gain is controlled in such a way that the maximum
energy modulation of the electron beam at the exit is about equal to the local
energy spread, but still far away from saturation. When the electron bunch passes
through the dispersion section this energy modulation leads to eﬀective compression
of the particles. Then the bunched electron beam enters the tapered undulator and
produces strong radiation in the process of coherent deceleration.

We demonstrate that a frequency doubler scheme can be integrated into the SASE
FEL at the TESLA Test Facility at DESY, and will allow to reach 3 nm wavelength
with GW-level of output peak power. This would extend the operating range of the
FEL into the so-called water window and signiﬁcantly expand the capabilities of
the TTF FEL user facility.

1 Introduction

The soft X-ray FEL at the TESLA Test Facility at DESY (TTF FEL) will cover a
spectral range between approximately 60 nm and 6 nm wavelength. The minimum wave-
length of 6 nm is determined by the maximum electron beam energy of 1 GeV. It would
be extremely interesting to extend this range into the so-called water window, i.e. the
range between the K-Absorption edges of carbon and oxygen at 4.38nm and 2.34 nm, re-
spectively. This would allow time-resolved studies of organic molecules above the carbon
K-edge, and, for example, the investigation of thick, hydrated biological samples by X-ray
microscopy without the need of shock-freezing [1,2]. There are several techniques under
consideration to reach this goal: A X-ray SASE FEL at shorter wavelengths, which re-
quires higher beam energy or a shorter undulator period, and the generation of harmonics
through a nonlinear mechanism driven by bunching at the fundamental.

There are basically two methods to up-convert the fundamental radiation frequency
via nonlinear harmonics. These methods are the generation of third harmonic radiation
in a planar SASE undulator through a nonlinear mechanism driven by bunching at the
fundamental frequency, and a two-undulator (second) harmonic generation scheme, also
referred to as the ”after-burner” method.

SASE FELs are capable to produce powerful radiation not only at the fundamental
frequency, but also at higher harmonics. When a beam is strongly bunched in the sinu-
soidal ponderomotive potential formed by the undulator ﬁeld and the radiation ﬁeld of
the fundamental frequency, the electron beam density spectrum develops rich harmonic
contents. Coherent radiation at the odd harmonics can be generated in a planar undulator
and signiﬁcant power levels for the third harmonic can be reached before the FEL satu-
rates (see [3–6] and references therein). It is expected that the power of the transversely
coherent third-harmonic radiation can approach the 1% level of the fundamental power at
the TTF. Since the nonlinear harmonic generation occurs naturally in a planar undulator,
no additional FEL hardware components are required for this method.

An idea of using two undulators, with the second undulator resonant to one of the
harmonics of the ﬁrst one, was considered in [7–9] (it is also referred to as the “after-
burner” method). The ﬁrst undulator is long enough to reach saturation and produce
strong spatial bunching in harmonics. The bunched beam generates coherent radiation
in the second undulator which follows immediately the ﬁrst one. The main problem with
this approach is the large induced energy spread which will be generated by the bunching
of the electron beam at the fundamental frequency. While this energy spread is necessary
for the bunching, it degrades the performance of the radiator section at the harmonic
frequency. Another method to generate higher harmonics is the high-gain harmonic gen-
eration scheme (see [10,11] and references therein). It should be noted that all previous
studies of such frequency multiplication schemes were performed in the framework of the
steady-state approach, and the question arises how eﬀectively they work in the case of a
SASE FEL.

In this paper we propose an eﬀective frequency doubler scheme for a SASE FEL. It
consists of an undulator tuned to the ﬁrst harmonic, a dispersion section, and a tapered
undulator tuned to the second harmonic (see Fig. 1). The ﬁrst stage is a conventional

soft X-ray SASE FEL. The gain of the ﬁrst stage is controlled in such a way that the
maximum energy modulation of the electron beam at the FEL exit is about equal to the
local energy spread, but still far away from saturation. When the electron bunch passes
through the dispersion section this energy modulation leads to eﬀective compression of
the particles. Then the bunched electron beam enters a tapered undulator, and from
the very beginning produces strong radiation because of the large spatial bunching. The
strong radiation ﬁeld produces a ponderomotive well which is deep enough to trap the
particles, since the original beam is relatively cold. The radiation produced by these
captured particles increases the depth of the ponderomotive well, and they are eﬀectively
decelerated. As a result, much higher power can be achieved than for the case of a uniform
undulator. In addition, the output radiation exhibits excellent spectral properties due to
the suppression of the sideband growth in a tapered undulator.

In this paper we analyze for the ﬁrst time the frequency multiplication scheme for
a SASE FEL. Simulations using the time-dependent code FAST [12], upgraded for the
simulation of higher harmonics, provide a “full physics” description of the process. We
illustrate the operation of the proposed frequency doubler for the parameters of the TTF
FEL. The result of our study is that a frequency doubler can be implemented at the
TESLA Test Facility. With an additional, 13.5 m long undulator (with 1.95 cm period
and 0.39 T peak magnetic ﬁeld), the TTF FEL would be able to produce radiation down to
3 nm wavelength with an output peak power in the GW range, and with excellent spectral
properties. The power of the third harmonic from this device (i.e. at 1 nm wavelength) is
still in the ten MW range, exceeding any other pulsed radiation source presently available
at 1 nm, and suﬃciently high for novel applications. In fact, this device approaches the
operating range of the future TESLA XFEL.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes recent updates of the TTF
FEL parameters which refer mainly to a smaller local energy spread than it was expected
before. Section 3 describes the operation of the frequency doubler scheme. Section 4
discusses the integration of the frequency doubler scheme into the TESLA Test Facility.
Appendixes 1 and 2 contain information on alternative ways for attaining 3 nm wavelength
at the TTF FEL using a uniform undulator and an after-burner, respectively.

2 6 nm operation of the SASE FEL at DESY

A soft X-ray SASE FEL will be commissioned as a user facility in 2004 at the TESLA
Test Facility at DESY, covering the wavelength range down to 6 nm. The ﬁrst description
of the TESLA Test Facility FEL has been written in 1995 [1]. An update of the TTF FEL
design was ﬁxed in 2002 [2]. The main issues were the change of the undulator focusing
structure (separated instead of integrated) and the bunch compression system (removing
the low-energy bunch compressor and introducing a RF structure operating at the 3rd
harmonic).

The analysis of recent experimental results obtained at the TTF FEL, Phase 1 [13] led
to the idea that the value of the local energy spread is signiﬁcantly less than it was expected
originally. Only a small value of the local energy spread allows one to obtain a high-peak
value of the bunch current after a single bunch compressor. Direct measurements of the
local energy spread gave an upper estimate below 5 keV at a beam current of about
100 A [14]. An extrapolation of this experimental result to the project value of 2500 A
beam current gives an estimate for the local energy spread of about 100 keV. This is
in agreement with recent start-to-end simulations of the bunch in the TTF linac [15,16]
predicting the value of the local energy spread within the lasing part of the bunch to
be well below 200 keV (see Fig. 3). Note that the original project value for the local
energy spread was 1 MeV [1,2]. The local energy spread is one of the essential parameters
inﬂuencing the FEL operation, and we have to analyze which impact it may have on the
operation of the current version of the TTF FEL and its future developments.

Tables 1 and 2 show an updated list of parameters for the SASE FEL at the TESLA
Test Facility at DESY. The decrease of the local energy spread results in shorter a sat-
uration length as it is seen in Fig. 4. This is a consequence of the fact that the previous
design did not have suﬃcient safety margin with respect to the energy spread. Figure 5
shows the time and spectral structure of the radiation pulse for the linear and saturation
regime.

With a small value of the local energy spread we fall in a diﬀerent region of physical

particular, the application of dispersion sections for beam bunching becomes very eﬀective.

3 Operation of a frequency doubler

In this section we illustrate the operation of the frequency doubler for the parameters
of the TTF FEL, Phase 2. The beam parameters are given in Table 1, and the parameters
of the doubler undulator and the dispersion section are listed in Table 3. The resonance
wavelength in the main X-ray undulator is equal to 6 nm, and the doubler undulator is
tuned to the resonance wavelength of 3 nm.

The frequency doubler scheme operates as follows. The electron bunch enters the main
X-ray undulator and produces SASE radiation at the wavelength of 6 nm. During the
ampliﬁcation process the radiation power grows exponentially with the undulator length.
Simultaneously, the energy and density modulation of the beam are growing. At the end
of the X-ray undulator the beam energy modulation is comparable with the local energy
spread. In the present example this takes place at an undulator length of 12.3 m. The
output characteristics of the radiation are illustrated with plots in Fig. 5 (upper row).
The upper left plot in Fig. 6 shows the phase space distribution of particles for the slice
corresponding to 330 fs time coordinate along the bunch. Such a picture is typical for every
spike. We see that the modulation amplitude at the second harmonic is small (see lower

left plot in this ﬁgure). On the other hand, there is visible energy modulation with an
amplitude of about the value of the local energy spread. When the electron bunch passes
through the dispersion section this energy modulation leads to eﬀective compression of
the particles as it is illustrated with plots in the right column in Fig. 6. When the bunched
beam enters the undulator tuned to the second harmonic, it immediately starts to produce
powerful radiation at the second harmonic. That is important, but not the main feature
of our proposal. Let us study more closely the phase space distribution of the particles
at the exit of the dispersion section. We see that this distribution is double-periodic with
respect to the second harmonic. I.e., only each second bucket is populated with particles.
If we trace the evolution of the FEL process in the uniform undulator, we ﬁnd that
“thermalization” takes place. The population of particles in the originally ﬁlled buckets
is reduced, and some of these particles travel into the ponderomotive well of originally
empty buckets. Simultaneously, the energy spread in the bunch grows due to the FEL
process. Finally, saturation occurs, and the properties of the radiation are close to those
described in Appendix 1.

Thus, another key idea of our proposal is to preserve the original bunching of the beam
and to organize an eﬀective extraction of the energy from the electron beam. This idea
is simply realized by using a tapered undulator. The process of ampliﬁcation proceeds

as follows. The bunched beam (double-periodic) produces strong radiation from the very
beginning because of the large spatial bunching. The strong radiation ﬁeld produces a
ponderomotive well which is deep enough to trap particles, since the original beam is
relatively cold. The radiation produced by these captured particles increases the depth
of the ponderomotive well, and they are eﬀectively decelerated. The undulator tapering
preserves the synchronism of trapped particles and radiation, and a signiﬁcant fraction
of the energy can be extracted. Simulations using the time-dependent FEL code FAST
[12] conﬁrm this qualitative picture. Figure 7 shows the evolution of the energy in the
radiation pulse in the tapered undulator. Despite of the original spiking seeding the pro-
cess of the second harmonic (see Fig. 6), we eﬀectively trap a signiﬁcant fraction of the
particles, and can achieve much higher power than for the case of an untapered undulator
(see Appendix 1). Figure 8 shows the temporal and spectral structure of the radiation
pulse after 9 and 13.5 meter of second-harmonic undulator. One can see that the radiation
pulse length is about a factor of two shorter than that of a traditional SASE FEL (see
Fig. 10). This is a consequence of the nonlinear transformation provided by the disper-
sion section. Another important feature of the radiation from a tapered undulator is the
signiﬁcant suppression of the sideband growth in the nonlinear regime (compare Figs. 8
and 10). This means that in the proposed scheme the spectral brightness of the radiation
is increased proportionally to the radiation power. In the case of a uniform undulator the
peak brightness is reached at the saturation point and is then reduced due to the sideband
growth [17].

4 Implementation of a frequency doubler scheme at the TESLA TEST Fa-

cility at DESY

The TTF FEL is a pioneer user facility in the VUV and soft X-ray wavelength range.
The conceptual design was ﬁrst elaborated in 1995 [1]. At that time only a single-pass
SASE FEL was considered. In 1998 it was decided to upgrade the TTF FEL by a seeding
option [18,19]. Other possible extensions of the TTF FEL user facility making use of some
space left behind the main FEL undulator have been discussed [20].

This free space downstream of the main undulator (see Fig 2) would be suﬃcient for
a 9 meter long (2 × 4.5 m sections) second harmonic radiator. It is planned now that the
main X-ray undulator will consist of six sections. This is mainly dictated by the wish to
have suﬃcient safety margin during the ﬁrst commissioning of the SASE FEL. However,
our analysis in the present paper shows that for the expected electron beam parameters
ﬁve undulator modules will be more than suﬃcient. This means that in the future there
will be space for three modules of the frequency doubler. This will allow to realize the full
frequency doubler and to extend the wavelength range of the TTF FEL down to 3 nm
with GW-level power without changing the present TTF layout. Additional hardware to
be manufactured is a dispersion section and a 13.5 m long undulator. Since the required
strength of the dispersion section is small, its design may be similar to that of a phase
shifter for the X-ray SASE FEL [21]. It will also be necessary to include a linear tapering
of 0.14%/m ( in the 13.5 m long undulator with 1.95 cm period and 0.39 T peak magnetic
ﬁeld. This does not appear to be a serious problem. In conclusion we can state that these
are minor expenses in view of the signiﬁcant extension of the capabilities of the TTF FEL
user facility.

5 Conclusion

In this paper we have described an eﬀective frequency doubler for SASE FELs. For the
ﬁrst time the frequency multiplication scheme has been analyzed for SASE FELs. To be
speciﬁc, we have illustrated the proposed FEL scheme using the parameters of the TESLA
Test Facility. It is shown that a frequency doubler allows to reach the water window and to
produce GW-level radiation pulses. It is important to note that a frequency doubler would
be well compatible with the seeding option, and would transfer all the advantages of the
seeding option to twice the photon energy [18,19]. In general, the frequency doubler scheme
has several signiﬁcant advantages over traditional SASE FELs with uniform undulators:
• shorter total magnetic length;
• a possibility to attain higher output power and brightness of the radiation;
• shorter radiation pulse duration.

The realization of a frequency doubler at the TTF is considered as extremely important
not only for reaching the water window. It may also be relevant for realizing the X-ray
FEL user facility in the 0.1 nm range. The use of frequency doublers at a large-scale
facility could result in a signiﬁcant reduction of the project costs. In addition, the safety
margin for facility operation becomes more relaxed.

Appendix 1: 3 nm option with uniform undulator

The maximum energy of the TTF linac is limited to 1 GeV. The present TTF undulator
has a period of 2.73 cm and a peak magnetic ﬁeld of 0.47 T which limits the minimum
wavelength to 6 nm. In principle, one can consider a scenario of constructing a short-
period undulator allowing to generate wavelengths down to 3 nm. Such an option was
not studied previously because of the large value of 1 MeV for the expected local energy
spread. However, in view of the change of this parameter it seems to be reasonable to
perform such a study in order to have a possibility for comparison of diﬀerent approaches
for attaining 3 nm wavelength. This section illustrates the option of a 3 nm SASE FEL
with a uniform undulator. The parameters of the electron beam are presented in Table 1,
and those of the undulator are given in Table 4.

Figure 9 shows the evolution of the energy in the radiation pulse along the undulator.
The growth of the radiation energy starts to saturate at an undulator length of about
36 m, and the radiation energy is about 100 µJ. Further increase of the undulator length
leads to a slow increase of the radiation energy, while the spectral width is increased due
to sideband growth in the nonlinear regime (see Fig. 10).

Appendix 2: 3 nm option with after-burner

An option of second harmonic generation at TTF FEL using an after-burner has been
under discussion for several years [22]. Here we present the results of time-dependent
simulations of the after-burner scheme. The parameters of the electron beam are given in
Table 1, and the parameters of the undulator and the output radiation are presented in
Table 5.

In the after-burner scheme the spent electron beam leaving the main X-ray undulator
passes an undulator tuned to the second harmonic. At the exit of the main undulator the
electron beam has a pronounced amplitude of density modulation at the second harmonic
which serves as input signal for the second-harmonic undulator (see Fig. 11). When the
electron beam enters the after-burner radiator, it readily starts to produce radiation.
However, the power growth saturates quickly at 2 meters, as it is seen from Fig. 12. This
is due to the large energy spread induced in the main undulator (see Fig. 11). Figure 13
presents the temporal and spectral structure of the radiation pulse at the exit of the
after-burner. We ﬁnd that the FWHM pulse duration is relatively large, about 250 fs. The
spectral width is also large, about 0.4%, and is driven by the FEL process in the main
undulator. Finally, the level of output radiation power is low, about 60 MW, i.e. about
3% of the power of the fundamental frequency of the main undulator. Remembering that
SASE radiation from a planar undulator at saturation always contains the 3rd harmonic
at a per cent level, we conclude that harmonic generation using an after-burner does not
provide extra opportunities for user applications.

Abstract

A systematic study is presented on the superconductiv-
ity (sc) parameters of the ultrapure niobium used for the
fabrication of the nine-cell 1.3 GHz cavities for the lin-
ear collider project TESLA. Cylindrical Nb samples have
been subjected to the same surface treatments that are
applied to the TESLA cavities: buﬀered chemical polish-
ing (BCP), electrolytic polishing (EP), low-temperature
bakeout (LTB). The magnetization curves and the com-
plex magnetic susceptibility have been measured over a
wide range of temperatures and dc magnetic ﬁelds, and
also for diﬀerent frequencies of the applied ac magnetic
ﬁeld. The bulk superconductivity parameters such as the
critical temperature Tc = 9.26 K and the upper critical
ﬁeld Bc2(0) = 410 mT are found to be in good agreement
with previous data. Evidence for surface superconduc-
tivity at ﬁelds above Bc2 is found in all samples. The
critical surface ﬁeld exceeds the Ginzburg-Landau ﬁeld
Bc3 = 1.695Bc2 by about 10% in BCP-treated samples
and increases even further if EP or LTB are applied.
From the ﬁeld dependence of the susceptibility and a
power-law analysis of the complex ac conductivity and
resistivity the existence of two diﬀerent phases of surface
superconductivity can be established which resemble the
Meissner and Abrikosov phases in the bulk: (1) “coher-
ent surface superconductivity”, allowing sc shielding cur-
rents ﬂowing around the entire cylindrical sample, for
external ﬁelds B in the range Bc2 < B < Bcoh
, and
c3
(2) “incoherent surface superconductivity” with discon-
nected sc domains for Bcoh
c3 < B < Bc3. The “coherent”
critical surface ﬁeld separating the two phases is found
to be Bcoh
c3 = 0.81 Bc3 for all samples. The exponents
in the power law analysis are diﬀerent for BCP and EP
samples, pointing to diﬀerent surface topologies.

Introduction

The proposed linear electron-positron collider project
TESLA is based on superconductor technology for parti-
cle acceleration. For a centre-of-mass energy of 500 GeV
an accelerating ﬁeld of 23.4 MV/m is required in the
1.3 GHz nine-cell cavities which are made from pure
niobium and cooled by superﬂuid helium at 2 K. The
cavities for the TESLA Test Facility (TTF) linac are
fabricated from 2.8 mm thick niobium sheets by deep
drawing and electron beam welding. A damage layer

of about 150 µm thickness is removed from the inner
surface to obtain optimum performance in the supercon-
ducting state. For the TTF cavities this has been done
so far by chemical etching which consists of two alter-
nating processes: dissolution of the natural Nb2O5 layer
by HF and re-oxidation of the niobium by a strongly ox-
idizing acid such as nitric acid (HNO3) [1, 2]. To reduce
the etching speed a buﬀer substance is added, for ex-
ample phosphoric acid, and the mixture is cooled below
15◦C. The standard procedure with a removal rate of
about 1 µm per minute is called buﬀered chemical pol-
ishing (BCP) using an acid mixture of HF (40%), HNO3
(65%) and H3PO4 (85%) in a volume ratio of 1:1:2. In
the most recent industrial production of 24 TTF cavi-
ties an average gradient 26.1
2.3 MV/m at a quality
1010 was achieved. The technology de-
factor Q0 = 1
veloped for TTF is hence adequate for TESLA-500 but
considerable improvements are needed for an upgrade of
the collider to 800 GeV. A detailed description of the
present status of the nine-cell cavity layout, fabrication,
preparation and tests can be found in [3].

190 mT at 2 Kelvin).

After many years of intensive R&D there exists now
compelling evidence that the BCP process limits the
attainable ﬁeld in multi-cell niobium cavities to about
30 MV/m. This is signiﬁcantly below the physical limit
of about 45 MV/m which is given by the condition that
the radio frequency (rf) magnetic ﬁeld has to stay below
the critical ﬁeld of the superconductor. For the type II
superconductor niobium the maximum tolerable rf ﬁeld
appears to be close to the thermodynamic critical ﬁeld
(Bc
An alternative surface preparation method is electrolytic
polishing (EP). The material is removed in an acid mix-
ture (for example HF and H2SO4) under the ﬂow of an
electric current. Sharp edges or tips are smoothed out
and a very glossy surface can be obtained. Using elec-
trolytic polishing, scientists at the KEK laboratory in
Tsukuba (Japan) achieved gradients of up to 40 MV/m
in single-cell cavities [4,5]. Meanwhile gradients of 35 - 40
MV/m have been obtained repeatedly in many 1.3 GHz
single-cell test cavities [6–8]. Recently the EP technology
has been successfully transferred to the nine-cell TESLA
cavities yielding a record value of 39 MV/m in a multicell
cavity [9].

The superiority of EP as compared to BCP can be
partially understood in terms of the much reduced

boundaries of an etched niobium surface may cause local
enhancements of the rf magnetic ﬁeld and thereby lead
to a premature breakdown of superconductivity at these
localized spots. A model based on this idea, developed
by Knobloch et al. [10], is able to explain the reduction
of the quality factor at high ﬁeld. However, a puzzling
observation which does not ﬁt into this geometrical
picture was made during the CERN-DESY-Saclay
R&D programme on the electropolishing of single-cell
cavities [8]: after the EP and rinsing with ultrapure

exhibited a strong decrease of quality factor when
high ﬁelds were approached. Applying a 24 - 48 hour

noted that the EP treatment at KEK [4, 5] already
included a bakeout at 85◦C. The BCS surface resistance
at 1.3-1.5 GHz is found to be reduced by a factor of 2
after baking [8, 11]. However, by removing a layer of
50 nm from the EP surface
∼

by “oxipolishing” the reduction in RBCS is lost and
the “Q drop” reappears [11]. The reduction of RBCS
during baking has been attributed to oxygen atoms
diﬀusing either from the dielectric Nb2O5 layer or from
intergrain niobium oxides/suboxides down to a depth
of 200-300 nm [11]. For further discussions we refer to
the review talks by P. Kneisel [12] and B. Visentin [13]
at the SRF2003 Workshop. Relevant investigations on
the inﬂuence of surface treatment on single cell cavities
have been presented at the same workshop by Ciovati et
al. [16].

−

Another explanation for the superiority of electropol-
ished cavities has been proposed by Halbritter [17]. The
smoother surface and the cleaner grain boundaries of an
EP-treated cavity may lead to a reduction of dielectric
surface losses which are caused by interface tunnel
exchange between the conduction electrons in Nb and
localized states in the Nb-Nb2O5−x interface.

Magnetic measurements on niobium samples are a useful
tool to explore the surface treatments which improve cav-
ity performance. This idea is based on the fact that for
pure niobium the ratio κ = λL/ξ is in the order of unity,
so that surface superconductivity and electromagnetic
losses of microwave ﬁelds reside in thin surface sheaths
of nearly the same thickness, given by the correlation
length ξ and the penetration depth λL, respectively. The
experimental studies on the magnetization and suscepti-
bility of niobium samples presented here have been car-
ried out with the aim to gain an understanding of the
superconducting properties in this sheath and their de-
pendence on the various treatments (BCP, EP, bakeout)
that are applied to the TESLA cavities. The samples
have been cut from remainders of the niobium sheets
used in cavity production and have been subjected to
the same chemical, electro-chemical and thermal treat-
ments as the TESLA cavities.

2 Experimental Procedure

The samples for the magnetization and susceptibility
measurements are cylinders with a raw diameter of
2.5 mm and a height of 2.8 mm which are cut by electro-
erosion from the Nb sheets used for rf cavity production.
The niobium is of high purity with a residual resistiv-

ity ratio RRR of 300. The impurity contents is given
in Table 1. The electroerosion leaves an oxide surface
layer of several µm thickness which is removed by chem-
ical etching of about 50 µm, applying the standard BCP
process. The samples are rinsed with ultrapure water
and annealed for 2 hours at 800 ◦C in a vacuum fur-
nace (p < 10−7 mbar) to remove dissolved hydrogen and
relieve mechanical stress in the material. After the an-
nealing a second 50 µm BCP and water rinsing is applied.
In this state the samples have a similar surface structure
as the BCP-treated cavities.

Several samples have been electropolished after the BCP
treatment. Only the cylindrical surface has been pol-
ished with a removed thickness between 40 µm and
165 µm. The EP has been carried out at room tem-
perature in a mixture of HF (56%) and H2SO4 (90%).
Low temperature baking (LTB) has been applied both to
BCP- and EP-treated samples, with a bakeout tempera-

ture of 100
and a baking time between 12 and 96 hours in a vacuum
furnace at p < 10−7 mbar. Three of the BCP-treated and
baked samples have been subsequently etched by 1 µm,
5 µm and 10 µm in order to investigate whether possible
baking eﬀects are lost by the removal of the surface layer.
Scanning Electron Microscopy and Atomic Force Mi-
croscopy [18] reveal a very low surface roughness of about
10 µm2). The
1 nm on the Nb grains (area of about 10
steps at grain boundaries range from 1 µm to a few µm
on BCP-treated samples [19] and are below 100 nm after
the EP.
The sample magnetization is determined with a commer-
cial SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS2)
at temperatures ranging from 2 K to 300 K in external dc
ﬁelds between zero and 1 Tesla. The SQUID magnetome-
ter allows also to measure the ac susceptibility at 10 Hz.
A second magnetometer, based on the mutual inductance
technique, is used in combination with a lock-in ampliﬁer
(EG&G PARC Model 5302) to extend the ac suscepti-
bility measurements up to frequencies of 1 MHz in the
temperature range between 1.5 K and 4.2 K (pumped
4He cryostat). The linearity of the response to the ap-
plied ac ﬁeld has been veriﬁed for ac ﬁeld amplitudes
from 0.1 µT to 500 µT. In all measurements the external
magnetic ﬁelds (dc and ac) are carefully aligned paral-
lel to the symmetry axis of the cylinders, so that above
Hc2 surface superconductivity can only nucleate on the
cylindrical walls and not on the end faces. The demagne-
tization factor NZ = 0.36 derived from the initial slope of

that neither electropolishing nor low-temperature bake-
out change the superconductor parameters of the bulk

The hysteresis loops observed in the magnetization mea-
surements are a clear proof of magnetic ﬂux pinning. Un-
der the assumption that pinning in the bulk dominates
one can derive the critical current density from the irre-
versible part of the magnetization: Jc = 3Mirr/a, where
a is the radius of the Nb cylinder. We obtain Jc = 240
A/mm2 for the BCP samples and Jc = 180 A/mm2 for
the EP samples (both at T = 4.2 K and B = 0). Since
EP does not aﬀect the bulk this diﬀerence implies that
surface ﬂux pinning plays an important role too. Simi-
lar observations were made by De Sorbo [27] who found
large variations of Jc between 10 and 1000 A/mm2 for
Nb with RRR
500, depending on the mechanical and
thermal treatment.

4.1 Critical surface ﬁeld

Close to the surface a type II superconductor remains
in the superconducting state even if the upper criti-
cal ﬁeld of the bulk is exceeded. According to the
Ginzburg-Landau theory the critical surface ﬁeld is given
by Bc3 = 1.695Bc2 [28]. Owing to the high sensitivity
of the SQUID magnetometer, evidence for surface super-

observable in all samples. In Fig. 5 we show the complex
ac susceptibility χ′
iχ′′ at 5.0 K and 10 Hz as a function
of the applied dc ﬁeld for samples with diﬀerent surface
treatments: BCP, EP, baked and unbaked.
Approaching the transition to superconductivity from
the normal state, i.e. from high ﬁelds, the nucleation
ﬁeld Bc3 is commonly deﬁned [29, 30] by the onset of
above the
screening, i.e., the appearance of a ﬁnite
suceptibility value χ′
n in the normal state. We observe a
strong dependence of Bc3 on the surface condition: the
BCP sample has the lowest Bc3, and both EP and baking
increase the critical surface ﬁeld.
The ac susceptibility of a BCP sample at temperatures
between 3.5 K and 9.0 K is plotted in Fig. 6. Similar
measurements have been performed for all samples. The
temperature dependence of Bc3 for samples with diﬀer-
ent surface treatment is shown in Fig. 7. The data are
well described by the relation

where the ratio r32 depends on the surface preparation
but not on the temperature, see Tab. 3 and Fig. 8.
The reproducibility of the measurements of the ratio r32
has been demonstrated on six BCP samples, two for
each of the Nb producers (all Nb sheets have RRR
≈
300). The average value for the BCP samples is r32 =

baking (LTB) increases the ratio r32 considerably, see
Fig. 8. Here the reproducibility has been demonstrated
on six BCP samples, two for each of the Nb producers,
which were baked for 48 h at 120◦C and yielded r32 =
0.05. In the bakeout at 123◦C the ratio r32 grows
2.33
with increasing baking time. At 144◦C a saturation value
of r32 = 2.59
0.05 is reached after 24 hours without
further increase towards longer baking times. The gain
in the ratio r32 is completely lost if a 1 µm surface layer
is removed by chemical etching. This proves that only a
thin surface layer is modiﬁed by the bakeout.

This means that Bc2 and Bc3 have the same temperature
dependence.

The existence of a critical surface ﬁeld exceeding the
upper critical ﬁeld of the bulk, Bc3 = rGL Bc2 with
rGL = 1.695, was predicted by de Gennes and Saint-
James by solving the linearized Ginzburg-Landau equa-
tion in the presence of a plane boundary which creates a
mirror image of the potential. If we retain this idea the
increased ratio r32 > rGL may be explained by assuming
a larger value of Bc2 close to the surface, Bsurf
c2 > Bbulk
,
and by relating Bc3 to this ﬁeld: Bc3 = rGL Bsurf
.
The enhanced Bsurf
c2 may be caused for instance by a
higher concentration of impurities and a reduced coher-
ence length.
One obvious contaminant is oxygen. After the discov-
ery of the bakeout eﬀect in cavities systematic studies
have been conducted on the morphological and chemical
structure of niobium samples, for instance by surface-
sensitive methods such as XPS (X-ray induced photo-
electron spectroscopy) [31–33]. These studies indicate
that baking causes a partial disintegration of the exter-
nal Nb2O5 layer and the formation of metallic suboxides
(NbO, NbO2).
The eﬀect of interstitial oxygen on the upper critical ﬁeld
of niobium was studied by Koch et al. [34]. The concen-
tration cO of oxygen in atomic per cent can be derived
from an expression valid at 4.2 K [35]

the surface sheath is not

of the conductivity rises steeply with decreasing ﬁeld.
Since ωσ′′ is proportional to the Cooper pair density4, it

set of long-range superconductivity in the surface sheath.

5.1 Surface conductivity and resistivity

We now examine in more detail the behaviour of the
niobium samples for applied magnetic dc ﬁelds in the
range between Bc2 and Bc3 where only a thin surface
sheath is superconducting while the bulk is in the nor-
mal state. Coming down from high ﬁelds, the screening
part of χ starts to grow upon crossing Bc3. Owing
to the high sensitivity of the SQUID magnetometer,
the onset of screening is clearly visible when
is
plotted on a logarithmic scale (Fig. 10). This allows
a precise determination of the critical surface ﬁeld
Bc3. On a linear scale, however, the onset of surface
superconductivity is barely visible, while a strong rise

For the EP samples (baked and unbaked) the expo-
nents are found to be equal: s = t = 1.3
0.1, see
Figs. 11 and 12. This is consistent with a 2-D model
of a percolation-driven transition to coherent supercon-
ductivity [38, 40, 41]. For the BCP samples, however,
the exponents s = 1.05
0.1 are
diﬀerent (see Fig. 13), indicating a dimensionality of the
percolating network which is slightly higher than two but
still much smaller than three [42]. The power law anal-
ysis points to diﬀerent surface topologies and electronic
structures of BCP and EP samples. As expected, bak-
ing has no inﬂuence on the topology, and hence does not
modify the exponents.
An interesting observation is that the coherent critical
surface ﬁeld is always a ﬁxed fraction of the Ginzburg-
Landau-type surface ﬁeld: Bcoh

dependent of the surface topology, see Fig. 14. This sug-

interpreted as the diﬀerence between two large counter-
rotating currents. We observe a clear diﬀerence between
electropolished and chemically etched samples: the BCP
cylinders have a factor of six smaller critical surface cur-
rents and the exponent is larger, v = 2.5

and negative value found for 2-D granular superconduct-

samples indicates that the surface currents have to follow
more complicated orbits than in EP samples. The lower
surface current densities J s
c in BCP-treated surfaces and
the higher twistedness index ∆ are possibly related to
the larger roughness at the grain boundaries.
The surface currents per unit length, as measured in our
experiment, are three orders of magnitude lower than the
currents that would be needed to excite a niobium cavity
105 A/m. How-
to rf magnetic ﬁelds beyond Hc2
ever, our quasi-static measurements (f = 10 Hz) do not
exclude the possibility that much higher surface currents
might exist in the non-equilibium state of superconduc-
tivity which is relevant for high-frequency cavities.

6 Paramagnetic susceptibility

By measuring the magnetic susceptibility in a large ex-
ternal ﬁeld B = 0.7 T where the entire sample is in the
normal state it is possible to search for magnetic impu-
rities in the niobium. The data are shown in Fig. 19a
for temperatures between 2 and 300 K. Above 50 K our
results on the paramagnetic susceptibility χel of the nor-
mal conduction electrons in Nb are in excellent agree-
ment with previous measurements by Hechtﬁscher [46].
Below 50 K an additional contribution to χ is observed,
which obeys a Curie-Weiss law

see Fig. 19b. The ﬁt values for the Curie constant C
and the Curie-Weiss temperature θ are listed in Tab. 5.
Such behaviour indicates the presence of localized mag-
netic impurities. While θ

Curie constant, being proportional to the concentration
of the localized magnetic moments, increases during the

Tab. 5, oxygen vacancies in the Nb2O5 sheath cannot
account for the observed magnetic behaviour.
The paramagnetism of other impurities, which may be
introduced by the BCP and EP processes, like N, C,
F, P, S, the hydrogen bonded H2O/CxHy (OH)z [48]
and some niobium suboxides NbOx (x . 1), has not
yet been investigated. Perhaps they form clusters with
large paramagnetic moments. After baking, the Curie
constant C is found to be increased by about 40
50 %.
One possibility would be that during baking additional
magnetic moments are released from external or internal
surfaces.

−

The observation that a BCP-treated sample has a sig-
niﬁcantly larger Curie constant than an EP sample indi-
cates that the magnetic moments are not conﬁned to the
surface only but reside also deeper in the material, prob-
ably in the grain boundaries which are more pronounced
in BCP than in EP surfaces.

7 Summary and conclusions

−

As expected, the bulk properties of the niobium samples,
Tc, Bc, RRR and Bc2, remain invariant when diﬀerent
surface treatments such as chemical etching and elec-
tropolishing or a low-temperature bakeout are applied.
In contrast to this, the superconducting properties of the
surface itself are found to be strongly modiﬁed by these
treatments. Evidence for surface superconductivity at
ﬁelds exceeding the upper critical ﬁeld Bc2 of the bulk is
found in all samples. The critical surface ﬁeld Bc3 is al-
ways larger than the value Bc3 = 1.695Bc2 derived from
the Ginzburg-Landau theory, the ratio r32 = Bc3/Bc3
amounts to 1.86 for BCP samples and 2.1 for EP samples.
140◦C
It increases further by baking the sample at 120
for 24 to 96 hours. We interpret this enhanced surface
ﬁeld as being due to increased impurity contents of the
niobium in a layer close to the surface and, related to
this, a reduced electron mean free path. The most likely
contaminant is oxygen.
A most remarkable observation is that two diﬀerent
phases of surface superconductivity exist which are sepa-
rated by a “coherent” critical surface ﬁeld Bcoh
c3 : a coher-
ent phase C for applied ﬁelds between Bc2 and Bcoh
c3 with
bipolar shielding currents going around the whole cylin-
drical sample, and an incoherent phase I between Bcoh
c3
and Bc3 which is characterized by disconnected super-
conducting regions with normal zones in between. Both
Bcoh
c3 and Bc3 depend on the surface preparation but the
ratio Bcoh
c3 /Bc3 has the value 0.81 for all samples: BCP,
EP, unbaked and baked. A power-law analysis of the
complex conductivity and resistivity reveals that at Bcoh
c3
a phase transition takes place between coherent and in-
coherent surface superconductivity. For the EP samples
the exponents are in agreement with the expectation for
percolation through a two-dimensional network of super-
conducting and resistive sections. A diﬀerent behaviour
is seen in the BCP samples, here the dimensionality of
the network would have to be slightly larger that two.
We suspect that this may be related to weak links at the
grain boundaries and to more complicated, nonplanar
current paths in the surface layer.
In the coherent phase C, a small net current around the
Nb cylinder can be induced by a time-varying magnetic
˙B according
ﬁeld whose direction depends on the sign of
to Lenz’s rule. However, this net current, being the dif-
ference of two counter-rotating currents, is only a few 100
A/m and thereby three orders lower than the rf currents
that would be needed to operate an accelerating cavity
105 A/m. Our
at rf magnetic ﬁelds above Hc2
steady-state results do not exclude the possibility that
higher surface currents might exist in non-equilibrium
states, for instance in the high-frequency ﬁelds applied
to accelerator cavities. In the BCP samples the surface
currents are a factor of six lower which again points to
weak links at grain boundaries.
An important result of our investigations is that the var-
ious surface preparation steps improving cavity perfor-

in niobium but at

mance have all a well-measurable inﬂuence on the mag-
netic properties of the samples. Electrolytic polishing
of a BCP sample raises the critical surface ﬁeld Bc3 by
about 10 %. The low-temperature baking leads to a fur-
ther enhancement by 20%. The critical exponents of
the power law ﬁts near Bcoh
c3 are diﬀerent for EP- and
BCP-treated samples: we get s = t = 1.3
0.1 for EP
±
and s = 1.05
0.1 for BCP samples.
From this one can conclude that the smooth EP sur-
face is able to support planar (two-dimensional) surface
currents while the rough grain boundaries in a BCP sur-
face enforce more complicated current patterns. The EP
samples feature a coherent surface phase which resembles
the Meissner phase in the bulk. In the BCP samples this
coherent phase is disturbed by weak links at the grain
boundaries.

low tem-
peratures an additional contribution is observed which
obeys a Curie-Weiss law and can be attributed to
paramagnetic impurities. Their number is increased
by low-temperature baking (LTB). This in qualitative
accordance with the generally accepted interpretation
that LTB leads to a partial reduction of the Nb2O5 layer
and an oxygen diﬀusion into deeper layers. Remarkably,
the density of paramagnetic impurities is larger in BCP
than in EP samples, which may be an indication that
the impurities in grain boundaries play an important
role.
In our view, the above observations are of high relevance
for rf cavities and underline the superiority of electropol-
ished surfaces.
It must be emphasized, however, that
measurements on niobium samples do not render cav-
ity tests superﬂuous. One essential diﬀerence is that the
samples are investigated in a large dc background mag-
netic ﬁeld with a superimposed small ac ﬁeld while in
the cavities the rf magnetic ﬁeld assumes large ampli-
tudes. It is by no means obvious that the superconduc-
tor responds in the same way to these diﬀerent condi-
tions.
In particular, the dramatic improvement in the
high-ﬁeld performance of EP cavities by applying the
low-temperature bakeout could certainly not have been
predicted from the 20% growth of Bc3 observed in EP-
treated Nb samples. According to our understanding the
underlying mechanisms of the bakeout eﬀect are not yet
fully understood.

The SQUID-Magnetometer MPMS2 made by Quantum
Design is an excellent apparatus to measure the dc mag-
netisation and the ac susceptibility of samples with a
very high sensitivity and over a wide range of magnetic
ﬁelds and temperatures. A superconducting solenoid
produces a dc ﬁeld up to
1 T, and a copper coil with 8
turns produces ac-ﬁelds from 10 nT up to 0.5 mT, with
frequencies from 0.01 Hz up to 1 kHz. The temperature
can be varied from 2 K up to 350 K. The measurable

where Iac = I0 exp(iωt) is the current in the ac coil,

by the ratio of sample volume to coil volume and χ the

Figure 20: Schematic coil conﬁguration of the SQUID mag-
netometer.

The detection coil system is built as a gradiometer of
second order and made from a single length of supercon-
ducting wire. The center coil with two turns is wound
clockwise, the upper and lower coils are 14 mm away
from the center coil and consists of a single turn each
wound counter-clockwise (see Fig. 20). This conﬁgura-
tion cancels noise due to ﬂuctuations in the large mag-
netic ﬁeld of the superconducting magnet. Together with
a transformer which couples the current changes to the
rf-SQUID the pick-up-coil forms a closed superconduct-
ing loop.
For dc magnetisation measurements, the sample is moved
through the pickup coil at constant speed. The scan
length is typically 40 mm, measurements are taken at
30-50 positions. At each position the motion is shortly
stopped for the measurement. The current induced in
the pickup coil by the moving sample is proportional to
the magnetic moment of the sample.
The ac susceptibility is measured at two diﬀerent
positions:
in the center coil of the pickup system and
in the lower compensation coil. Before applying the ac

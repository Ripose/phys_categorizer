NONLINEAR ACCELERATOR PROBLEMS VIA WAVELETS:
5. MAPS AND DISCRETIZATION VIA WAVELETS

A. Fedorova, M. Zeitlin, IPME, RAS, St. Petersburg, Russia ∗ †

Abstract

In this series of eight papers we present the applications of
methods from wavelet analysis to polynomial approxima-
tions for a number of accelerator physics problems. In this
part we consider the applications of discrete wavelet anal-
ysis technique to maps which come from discretization of
continuous nonlinear polynomial problems in accelerator
physics. Our main point is generalization of wavelet anal-
ysis which can be applied for both discrete and continuous
cases. We give explicit multiresolution representation for
solutions of discrete problems, which is correct discretiza-
tion of our representation of solutions of the corresponding
continuous cases.

INTRODUCTION

This is the ﬁfth part of our eight presentations in which
we consider applications of methods from wavelet anal-
ysis to nonlinear accelerator physics problems. This is a
continuation of our results from [1]-[8], in which we con-
sidered the applications of a number of analytical methods
from nonlinear (local) Fourier analysis, or wavelet analy-
sis, to nonlinear accelerator physics problems both general
and with additional structures (Hamiltonian, symplectic or
quasicomplex), chaotic, quasiclassical, quantum. Wavelet
analysis is a relatively novel set of mathematical methods,
which gives us a possibility to work with well-localized
bases in functional spaces and with the general type of
operators (differential, integral, pseudodifferential) in such
bases.
In contrast with parts 1–4 in parts 5–8 we try to
take into account before using power analytical approaches
underlying algebraical, geometrical, topological structures
related to kinematical, dynamical and hidden symmetry of
physical problems.

In this paper we consider the applications of discrete
wavelet analysis technique to maps which come from dis-
cretization of continuous nonlinear polynomial problems
in accelerator physics. Our main point is generalization of
wavelet analysis which can be applied for both discrete and
continuous cases. We give explicit multiresolution repre-
sentation for solutions of discrete problems, which is cor-
rect discretization of our representation of solutions of the
corresponding continuous cases.

In part 2 we consider symplectic and Lagrangian struc-
tures for the case of discretization of ﬂows by correspond-
ing maps and in part 3 construction of corresponding so-
lutions by applications of generalized wavelet approach
which is based on generalization of multiresolution anal-
ysis for the case of maps.

DISCRETIZATION

Discrete variational principles lead to evolution dynamics
analogous to the Euler-Lagrange equations [9]. Let Q be
a conﬁguration space, then a discrete Lagrangian is a map
L : Q × Q → R. usually L is obtained by approximating
the given Lagrangian. For N ∈ N+ the action sum is the
map S : QN +1 → R deﬁned by

S =

L(qk+1, qk),

(1)

N −1

X
k=0

where qk ∈ Q, k ≥ 0. The action sum is the discrete analog
of the action integral in continuous case. Extremizing S
over q1, ..., qN −1 with ﬁxing q0, qN we have the discrete
Euler-Lagrange equations (DEL):

D2L(qk+1, qk) + D1(qk, qq−1) = 0,

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

for k = 1, ..., N − 1.

Let

and

Φ : Q × Q → Q × Q

Φ(qk, qk−1) = (qk+1, qk)

is a discrete function (map), then we have for DEL:

D2L ◦ Φ + D1L = 0

or in coordinates qi on Q we have DEL

∂L
∂qi
k

∂L
∂qi

k+1

◦ Φ(qk+1, qk) +

(qk+1, qk) = 0.

(6)

It is very important that the map Φ exactly preserves the
symplectic form ω:

ω =

∂2L
k∂qj

(qk+1, qk)dqi

k ∧ dqj

3 GENERALIZED WAVELET

APPROACH

Our approach to solutions of equations (6) is based on ap-
plications of general and very efﬁcient methods developed
by A. Harten [10], who produced a ”General Framework”
for multiresolution representation of discrete data.

It is based on consideration of basic operators, decima-
tion and prediction, which connect adjacent resolution lev-
els. These operators are constructed from two basic blocks:
the discretization and reconstruction operators. The former
obtains discrete information from a given continuous func-
tions (ﬂows), and the latter produces an approximation to
those functions, from discrete values, in the same function
space to which the original function belongs.

A ”new scale” is deﬁned as the information on a given
resolution level which cannot be predicted from discrete
information at lower levels. If the discretization and recon-
struction are local operators, the concept of ”new scale” is
also local.

The scale coefﬁcients are directly related to the predic-
tion errors, and thus to the reconstruction procedure.
If
scale coefﬁcients are small at a certain location on a given
scale, it means that the reconstruction procedure on that
scale gives a proper approximation of the original function
at that particular location.

This approach may be considered as some generalization
of standard wavelet analysis approach. It allows to con-
sider multiresolution decomposition when usual approach
is impossible (δ-functions case). We demonstrated the dis-
cretization of Dirac function by wavelet packets on Fig. 1
and Fig. 2.

Let F be a linear space of mappings

F ⊂ {f |f : X → Y },

(8)

where X, Y are linear spaces. Let also Dk be a linear op-
erator

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

where Ik is the identity operator in V k (Rk is right inverse
of Dk in V k).

Given a sequence of discretization {Dk} and sequence
of the corresponding reconstruction operators {Rk}, we
deﬁne the operators Dk−1
and P k

k

k−1

Dk−1
= Dk−1Rk : Vk → Vk−1
k
P k
k−1 = DkRk−1 : Vk−1 → Vk

If the set Dk in nested [10], then

Dk−1

k P k

k−1 = Ik−1

and we have for any f ∈ F and any p ∈ F for which the
reconstruction Rk−1 is exact:

(Dkf ) = Dk−1f

Dk−1
k
k−1(Dk−1p) = Dkp

P k

Let us consider any vL ∈ V L, Then there is f ∈ F such
that

vL = DLf,

and it follows from (15) that the process of successive dec-
imation [10]

vk−1 = Dk−1

vk,

k

k = L, ..., 1

(17)

yields for all k

vk = Dkf

(18)

Thus the problem of prediction, which is associated with
the corresponding MR scheme, can be stated as a prob-
lem of approximation: knowing Dk−1f , f ∈ F , ﬁnd a
”good approximation” for Dkf . It is very important that
each space V L has a multiresolution basis

¯BM = { ¯φ0,L

i }i, {{ ¯ψk,L

j }j}L

k=1

(19)

Dk : f → {vk},

vk = {vk
i ∈ Y.

i },

vk = Dkf,

(9)

and that any vL ∈ V L can be written as

This sequence corresponds to k level discretization of X.
Let

Dk(F ) = V k = span{ηk
i }
and the coordinates of vk ∈ V k in this basis are ˆvk = {ˆvk
ˆvk ∈ Sk:

(10)

vk = X

i ηk

Dk is a discretization operator. Main goal is to design a
multiresolution scheme (MR) [10] that applies to all se-
quences s ∈ SL, but corresponds for those sequences
ˆvL ∈ SL, which are obtained by the discretization (8).

Since Dk maps F onto V k then for any vk ⊂ V k there
is at least one f in F such that Dkf = vk. Such correspon-
dence from f ∈ F to vk ∈ V k is reconstruction and the
corresponding operator is the reconstruction operator Rk:

Rk : Vk → F,

DkRk = Ik,

When L → ∞ we have sufﬁcient conditions which ensure
that the limiting process L → ∞ in (21, 22) yields a mul-
tiresolution basis for F . Then, according to (19), (20) we
have very useful representation for solutions of equations
(6) or for different maps construction in the form which are
a counterparts for discrete (difference) cases of construc-
tions from parts 1-4.

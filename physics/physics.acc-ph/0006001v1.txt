Abstract

INTRODUCTION

A new CESR/CLEO interaction region [1, 2] was installed
in 1995 as part of the CESR Phase II upgrade. At the same
time the CLEO experiment [3] installed a silicon vertex de-
tector (SVX) around a 2 cm radius beryllium beampipe,
and new detector shielding. (The new conﬁguration of the
CLEO detector is referred to as CLEO II.V[4]) The use
of radiation sensitive SVX readout electronics located just
outside the central beampipe placed a premium on accu-
rate prediction and understanding of beam-related detector
backgrounds at CESR. This article describes the detector
shielding system, commissioning and operational experi-
ence and presents a status report on our present understand-
ing of beam-generated detector backgrounds at CESR.

The CESR Phase II interation region (IR) was optimized
for bunch train collisions at a small horizontal crossing an-
gle (see [5] in these proceedings). CESR presently oper-
ates with 9 trains of bunches, each of which consists of 4
bunches spaced by 14 ns. The peak stored beam current
to date is 550 mA with nearly equal electron and positron
beam currents.

The dominant CLEO detector background arises from
lost particles generated by bremsstrahlung interactions with
the residual gas within about 30 m of the IP. Coulomb
scattering is a small contribution as is the dose from scat-
tered synchrotron radiation. The CLEO experiment is sen-
sitive to beam-generated backgrounds through the follow-
ing mechanisms: i) background hits (detector occupancy)
in the drift chambers, ii) background hits (occupancy) in
the SVX, iii) radiation dose to the SVX readout electron-
ics, iv) radiation dose to the CsI crystal calorimeter and
v) increased data-acquisition trigger rates.
It turns out
that the radiation sensitivity of the silicon readout elec-
tronics (CAMEX ampliﬁers) placed the most stringent re-
quirements on the maximum tolerable detector background
rates. Radiation damage studies [6] found that the fail-

ure dose for the powered CAMEX ampliﬁers is ∼25 krad
(∼100 krad unpowered). For detector shielding design pur-
poses we chose the following design criteria: i) SVX layer
1 occupancy < 1% hits/strip/µs, and ii) SVX readout elec-
tronics dose < 20 krad in 3 years.

REGION

2.1 Design Considerations

The crossing angle orbit has important consequences for
synchrotron radiation backgrounds. The incoming beam is
off-axis in the interaction region quadrupoles, perhaps by
as much as 1 cm, generating substantial SR power only a
few meters from the IP. This source alone would lead to
unacceptably large detector backgrounds. In order to bring
the incoming beam nearer the axis of the nearest horizon-
tally focusing quadrupole, the beam is displaced horizon-
tally with a magnetic IP displacement bump. This bump
was included in the lattice design phase to ensure adequate
aperture. With the use of this bump, SR powers are reduced
and with proper shielding the background rates are accept-
able. In addition, for injection the beams are separated hor-
izontally at the IP, again placing one beam off-axis in the
IR quads and producing higher SR ﬂuxes during injection
than HEP.

The detector background shielding system was de-
signed based on the results of detector background simu-
lations which were developed for lost particles and syn-
chrotron radiation. These simulations are described in
detail elsewhere[2, 7]. The results of these simulations
were compared to detector background measurements per-
formed with CLEO-II and were found to be in very good
agreement providing conﬁdence in their predictive power
[8, 9, 10, 7].

2.2 Detector Shielding

The detector shielding consists of two parts. The detec-
tor is shielded from lost beam particles by a large tung-
sten mask approximately 2.5 cm thick extending from ∼24
cm to ∼50 cm from the IP. In addition, the rare-earth
permanent magnet quadrupole material provides additional
shielding outboard of the tungsten mask. Tungsten was se-
lected as the mask material because of its short radiation
length. The detailed shape was designed based on the re-
sults of Monte-Carlo simulations of beam-gas scattering.

The detector is shielded from synchrotron radiation by a
stepped copper mask. The innermost mask tip is located
at r = 1.2 cm and z = 26 cm. The mask is proﬁled
in such a way that SR photons strike only the tips of the
mask structure; the surfaces parallel to the beam direction
are angled slightly so that these surfaces intercept no SR
ﬂux that would otherwise forward scatter into the detector
beampipe. As a result, all incoming SR power is absorbed
on the tips. Rather than make these tip surfaces at right
angles to the beam direction, the surfaces are sloped to re-
duce the HOM power generated in the structure. The slope
is small enough that the tip surfaces remain hidden from the
detector beampipe. Thus, the background from SR arises
from photons which scatter through a mask tip (“tipscatter-
ing”) and photons which pass over the innermost mask tip
and strike the downstream surface of the mask and subse-
quently scatter into the beampipe (“backscattering”).

The central detector beampipe [11] is a double-walled
water cooled beryllium beampipe with inner radius r = 1.9
cm. To further reduce the SR backgrounds a 10 µm gold
coating was deposited [12] on the inner surface of the
beampipe. The coating reduces the radiation dose to the
SVX detector by 3-4 orders of magnitude. To further re-
duce the lost particle background the innermost mask tip is
made of tantalum rather than copper. Since during injection
one of the beams is off-axis in the IR quads, the possibil-
ity for large SR ﬂuxes exists. A set of retractable tungsten
foil radiation shields are mounted to the beampipe. These
tungsten shields were closed during CESR injection for the
ﬁrst year of operation, and then were left open during HEP
operations and closed during machine studies.

In order to reduce beam-gas scattering near the IR new
vacuum chambers and pumping was installed within ±12
m of the IP. IR Pumping is accomplished in large plenums
which incorporate massive titanium sublimation pumping
[13]. Pumping plenums are located at ± 2m, ± 6 m, and ±
10 m from the IP.

Detector backgrounds are monitored with two systems.
The ﬁrst
is a PIN diode radiation monitoring system
mounted directly on the ends of the beryllium beampipe.
Twelve diodes are mounted on each end and are uniformly
distributed in azimuth. This system is sensitive to both
charged particles and SR photons. Another system, con-
sisting of a set of CsI crystals placed in the CLEO endcaps,
is useful for monitoring charged particle backgrounds.

The background simulation predictions for design cur-
rents (600 mA total) and a 40% duty factor are given in
Table 1. Both the expected dose and occupancy are be-
low the design goals mentioned above. As can be seen the
beam-gas background dominates.

pletely devoted to machine studies, the next two months to
a detector engineering run, but after that the detector ran
continously for three years. There were eight scheduled
maintenance periods lasting, on average, three and a half
weeks and three unscheduled periods each of less than one
week. The integrated running time of the detector was 142
weeks. During that time the total accumulated radiation
dose measured by the beampipe PIN diode monitors was
22.2 krads. Of that, 14.8 krads were logged when CESR
was delivering luminosity to CLEO and 12.0 krads when
CLEO was actually taking data. The dose when CESR was
not delivering luminosity was dominated by injection, and
amounts to 3.6 krads. This implies that injection for lu-
minosity represents 30% of the dose logged in data taking.
The balance of the dose was logged in machine studies (3.5
krads) and during the short time spent between injection
and HEP data-taking (0.3 krads). Most of the dose during
machine studies (∼75%) was logged during injection. The
integrated dose versus month of running is shown in Fig-
ure 1.

3 OPERATIONAL EXPERIENCE

Figure 1: The integrated interaction point dose versus
month of CLEO II.V running.

3.1 Total Dose and Average Rates

CLEO II.V ran for a total of 172 weeks from 29 October
1995 until 15 February 1999. The ﬁrst month was com-

During the course of the CLEO II.V run CESR delivered
11.6 fb−1 of luminosity and CLEO logged 9.0 fb−1. The
total Amp-Hours accumulated during the CLEO II.V run

was just over 4000. These imply that the total dose rates
were 0.16 krads/running week, 1.9 krads/fb−1 delivered,
2.5 krads/fb−1 logged, and 5.6 rads/Amp-Hour. Based on
these numbers and the expected radiation hardness of the
SVX readout electronics the detector could have survived
for 30% longer. We did have one readout chip fail in the
way expected from radiation damage; a sudden increase in
noise in all the channels in the chip was observed in the
last six months of running. This chip was in layer 3 where
lower quality chips were used, but the dose rate was ex-
pected to be more than a factor of two smaller than that
observed by the PIN diode system which is located near
layer 1.

During the Phase II IR commissioning period, 2.4 krads
were accumulated in the ﬁrst three months with only 155
A-hr. There are several reasons for this high speciﬁc dose
rate. The dynamic pressure rise (dP/dI) was naturally
large during this period since new vacuum chambers were
installed in the IR. In addition, much of the time was spent
tuning high current injection which has a higher dose rate
than colliding beam running. This startup period repre-
sented a dose/A-hr about three times what was achieved
in normal running.

4 COMPARISON OF MEASUREMENTS

WITH SIMULATION

4.1 Pressure Bump Studies

Controlled pressure bump studies are among the most
important tests of the beam-gas background simulation
since such tests check directly the model of the source-
effectiveness for scattered beam particles. By source-
effectiveness we mean the relative contibution to detector
background due to beam-gas scattering at a particular loca-
tion in the ring. The source-effectiveness for SVX layer 1
hits predicted by the beam-gas simulation is shown in Fig-
ure 2. (Reference [14] in these proceedings shows another
source effectiveness calculation, that for IR mask strikes.)
The actual background is therefore the source-effectiveness
weighted by the pressure proﬁle scaled appropriately by the
beam current.

We have performed such studies by turning off pumps
near the IR to generate pressure bumps and by introducing
calibrated leaks. We report on one such study in which a
calibrated N2 leak was introduced 12 m from the IP. A se-
ries of “pump conditions” was generated by turning off suc-
cessive pumps near the IR [16]. Pressures were recorded
for each pump condition. These data were used together
with a model of pumping in the IR (described in [14] in
these proceedings) to generate a predicted pressure proﬁle.
Pressure proﬁles for seven pump conditions predicted by
the model are shown in Figures 3 and 4.
The detec-
tor radiation dose was measured for each of these seven
conditions. The pressure proﬁles together with the source-
effectiveness and known beam current provide a simulation
prediction of the radition dose for each of the pump condi-

We can also check the prediction of our simulation in stan-
dard high energy physics (HEP) running conditions. This
prediction depends on the pressure distribution which is
taken from a calculation[15] done at a beam current of 300
mA. The extrapolation to different beam currents is done by
assigning the pressure measurements (cold-cathode gauges

current to give the background levels as a function of beam
current. Figure 7 shows the radiation level at the IP. The
agreement is striking.

ment here is good, but is complicated by many confounding

factors. The occupancy measured in the SVX is a combi-
nation of beam-related occupancy and electronic noise ef-
fects. These electronic noise effects are measured with no
beam in the machine, but are very sensitive to many other
conditions. The electronic noise measured at zero beam
current (0.009 hits/strip/event) has been added in quadra-
ture with the beam-gas simulation hits to obtain the model
prediction shown in the Figure. We also compare the occu-
pancy prediction and measurement as functions of the de-
tector tracking layer in Figure 9 for 300 mA total current.
The electronic noise at zero beam current is determined for
each layer and combined with the beam-gas simulation hits
as described above. The agreement for the SVX (layers 1-
3) is quite good – within a factor of two – while for the gas
tracking devices (the remaining layers) is within measure-
ment errors.

Note that in all these comparisons between the measured
beam induced backgrounds and the simulation prediction,
the contribution of synchrotron radiation is neglected. The
effects of synchrotron radiation are not expected to pene-
trate beyond the second tracking layer and thus would only
be observable in the radiation level and the ﬁrst two lay-
ers of the SVX. In any case the simulation predicts that the
contribution to SVX detector occupancy from synchrotron
radiation during HEP running is negligible.

4.3

Synchrotron Radiation

Under normal HEP running the SR contribution to detec-
tor backgrounds cannot be detected. As mentioned above,
simulation predicts the radiation dose from SR to be 8%
that of lost particles, and the contribution to detector occu-
pancy only 1%. Therefore, to observe SR or to compare
with simulations it is necessary to adjust the orbit through
the IR so that the beam is intentionally placed far off-axis
in the IR quadrupoles in order to generate large SR ﬂuxes.
As a machine studies experiment large SR ﬂuxes were
generated in two ways. In the ﬁrst (case A), the crossing
angle was increased from 2.0 mrad to 2.7 mrad (yielding a
displacement of 19mm in Q1), and in the second (case B),
a large amplitude bump was added to a reduced pretzel to
yield x′
I P = −1.9 mrad and xI P = 2.7 mm (yielding a
displacement of 24 mm in Q1). For each measurement a
single 10 mA bunch was used. The tunes were adjusted as
needed to maintain good lifetime (τ > 1000 min). In addi-
tion, the CsI radiation detectors were monitored to ensure
that the particle backgrounds were maintained at a negligi-
ble level. The crossing angle and bump amplitude (needed
for input to the SR background simulation) were obtained
by ﬁtting the orbits to separator kicks and magnetic correc-
tor strengths respectively.

The trajectory for case A is shown in Figure 10. The
incoming beam is bent in the strong horizontally focusing
quadrupole Q1. The radiation fan from the central trajec-
tory is shown by the upper and lower dotted lines. The
beam is bent in Q0 (vertically focussing) and its radiation
fan is shown by the lower and middle dotted lines. Thus,

tors are shown as black squares located at (±0.13, ±0.02).
The “outside” of CESR is +x and the “inside” is −x.

the mask tips on the outside of CESR are illuminated by Q1
radiation (from the core of the beam) and the downstream
inside backscattering mask surface is illuminated by both
Q1 and Q0 radiation (from beamsize).

The measured radiation distribution is compared to the
Monte-Carlo simulation results in Figure 11. The highest
radiation is observed in monitors 0-11 (downstream; z > 0
in Figure 10) and arises from SR which backscatters from
the downstream mask surface. The monitors on the down-
stream end (0-11) have a larger solid angle from the mask
surface than those on the upstream end (12-23) and those
lying in the plane outside of CESR have the largest solid
angle and therefore the largest radiation dose from x-ray
ﬂuorescence. The radiation on the upstream monitors is
due primarily to tipscattering. The tips on the outside of
CESR are illuminated by Q1 radiation. The upstream mon-
itors therefore have the largest solid angle from the tip, and
those on the inside have a larger solid angle than those on
the outside.

The comparison for case B is shown in Figure 12. The
trajectory is displaced even further in Q1, so event greater
SR ﬂuxes are generated. The radiation distribution is simi-
lar to that of the previous case. The agreement between the
SR simulation and the data is quite good - typically within
a factor of two. The experimental cases each test two dif-
ferent aspects of the SR simulation since the backscatter-
ing and tipscattering sources separately give rise to radia-
tion in the downstream and upstream monitors respectively.
Therefore, agreement for monitors 0-11 can be viewed as
a test of the backscattering portion of the simulation while
agreement for monitors 12-23 tests the tipscattering portion
of the simulation.

synchrotron radiation experiment labelled “case A.” The
monitors 0-11 are “downstream” in the experiment (z > 0
in Figure 10), and 12-23 are “upstream” (z < 0). The num-
bering is as follows: 0 and 12 are located in the plane of the
machine on the outside of CESR, 3 and 15 are located on
the top, 6 and 18 are located on the inside of CESR and 9
and 21 are located on the bottom.

5 CONCLUSION

The CESR/CLEO II.V interaction region has been de-
scribed. The radiation dose measured by the IR radiation
monitors during 172 weeks of operation is 22.2 krads, 12
krads of which was accumulated during HEP data-taking.
Detailed comparisons of the background simulation with
measured detector background and radiation dose have
been performed. The agreement between measured and
predicted radiation doses in the IR from beam-gas scatter-
ing is quite good, within ∼25% for the various experiments
described. The comparison between beam-gas simulation
and measured detector occupancies is in many ways more
challenging. The agreement here is within a factor of two
over a range in beam currents and better at higher currents.
Synchrotron radiation is not readily observed during HEP
running. The results of an experiment to generate a large
SR dose were described and a comparison to simulation
shows agreement within a factor of two in general, and
much better in some cases. We are conﬁdent in the abil-
ity of these simulations to predict detector backgrounds at
CESR and have based the design of the CESR Phase III IR
shielding on them.

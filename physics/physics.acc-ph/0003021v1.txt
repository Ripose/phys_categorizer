Diﬀraction Radiation Diagnostics for Moderate to High Energy

Charged Particle Beams

Abstract

Diﬀraction radiation (DR) is produced when a charged particle passes through an
aperture or near a discontinuity in the media in which it is traveling. DR is closely
related to transition radiation (TR), which is produced when a charged particle tra-
verses the boundary between media with diﬀerent dielectric constants. In contrast to
TR, which is now extensively used for beam diagnostic purposes, the potential of DR
as a non-interceptive, multi-parameter beam diagnostic remains largely undeveloped.
For diagnostic measurements it is useful to observe backward reﬂected DR from an cir-
cular aperture or slit inclined with respect to the beam velocity. However, up to now,
well founded equations for the spectral-angular intensities of backward DR from such
apertures have not been available. We present a new derivation of the spectral angular
intensity of backward DR produced from an inclined slit for two orientations of the
slit axis, i.e. perpendicular and parallel to the plane of incidence. Our mathematical
approach is generally applicable to any geometry and simpler than the Wiener Hopf
method previously used to calculate DR from single edges. Our results for the slit are
applied to the measurement of orthogonal beam size and divergence components. We
discuss the problem of separating the simultaneous eﬀects of these beam parameters on
the angular distribution of DR and provide solutions to this diﬃculty. These include
use of the horizontal and vertical polarization components of the radiation from a sin-
gle slit and interferences from two inclined slits. Examples of DR diagnostics for a 500
MeV beam are presented and the current limitations of the technique are discussed.

1 Introduction

The new generation very high power radiation devices such as short wavelength free electron
lasers and single pass spontaneous emission (SASE) devices for the generation of intense uv
and x-ray beams requires the development of linear accelerators which produce optical quality
charged particle beams. The high power, small size and low emittance of these beams present
an enormous challenge for both the diagnostic measurement of beam parameters and the
accurate positioning and control of these beams. Conventional screens or other interceptive
probes are incompatible with the operation of such accelerators in many instances. Non
interceptive devices such as wall monitor arrays, give limited beam information. Other
types of monitors, such as synchrotron monitors, while non-invasive, cannot be used in
linear beam line geometries. Hence the development of low cost, compact, nondestructive
monitors capable of measuring multiple beam parameters would be very useful for many
high power beam applications.

We have investigated how the properties of diﬀraction radiation (DR) can be used to
measure beam divergence, energy, position, transverse beam size and emittance. DR devices
such as slits or circular apertures through which the beam passes oﬀer minimal perturbation
to the beam, respond rapidly to changes in beam parameters and are inherently compact,
so that they can be implemented at many places in the beam line.

Diﬀraction radiation (DR) is produced when a charged particle passes through an aper-
ture or near an edge or interface between media with diﬀerent dielectric properties. DR
is closely related to transition radiation (TR), which is produced when a charged particle
traverses the boundary between media with diﬀerent dielectric constants. DR has been
studied theoretically since the early 1960’s, [1–5]. However, in contrast to TR, which has
been well investigated experimentally and is now used extensively for beam diagnosis, we are
aware of only two experimental studies of DR in the literature [6],[7]. In only one of these
investigations [6] was DR actually used as a beam parameter diagnostic, i.e. to measure
the beam bunch length. Furthermore, in this study forward and 1800 backward directed
DR and TR were observed simultaneously. This situation complicated the comparison of
measured to theoretically predicted DR properties. Therefore, to avoid such diﬃculties and
for experimental convenience, it is advantageous to observe the radiation from an inclined
aperture, e.g. a slit inclined at 450, which produces DR both in the forward direction and
in the direction of specular reﬂection of the virtual photons associated with the particle, i.e.
at 90 degrees with respect to the beam velocity.

The detailed nature of the far ﬁeld angular distribution (AD) of forward directed DR
has been derived and discussed by Ter-Mikaelian [4] for an electron normally incident on a
circular aperture and a slit in an inﬁnite, thin plane. The ﬁelds and AD of DR from an
electron incident on a single edge (half plane) inclined at an arbitrary angle with respect to
the velocity vector of the particle have also been derived and discussed in Refs. [2], [4] and [8].
Although some authors have surmised that reﬂected DR from an inclined circular aperture
or slit has properties similar to reﬂected TR [9-10], a derivation, from ﬁrst principles, of the
spectral-angular distribution of reﬂected DR from such apertures has not been previously

1

available in the literature. We present here solutions for the ﬁelds and the horizontally and
vertically polarized intensities of DR from an inclined slit for two orientations of the slit
edge, i.e.parallel and perpendicular with respect to the plane of incidence.

Previous theoretical investigations of forward directed DR generated from electron beams
passing through circular apertures and slits [9-12] have examined the potential use of the far
ﬁeld angular distribution (AD) to diagnose beam properties such as position with respect to
the center of the aperture, beam size, trajectory angle, divergence and energy. The potential
advantage and diﬃculty in using the AD of DR for beam diagnostics is that it depends on
the beam position (size) as well as the beam divergence and energy. In contrast, the AD
of TR depends only on the beam divergence and energy. The challenge for the application
of the AD of DR as a diagnostic then is to devise a means to separate out the competing
eﬀects of divergence and beam size on this observable.

We have developed a number of ways to address and solve this problem. We demon-
strate here how the measurements of the horizontal and vertical polarization components
of backward reﬂected DR from a single slit can be used to separate out the eﬀects of beam
size perpendicular to the slit edge and the component of divergence parallel to the slit edge.
Furthermore, we show how the measured AD’s for two diﬀerent orthogonal orientations of
the slit axis, can be used to determine the components of beam size and divergence in two
orthogonal directions, i.e. the directions perpendicular and parallel to the plane of incidence.
In addition we suggest how the interferences from two slits can be used to make a sensitive
measurement of divergence alone.

2 Diﬀraction Radiation Properties

When a charged particle or ensemble of particles passes through an aperture or near an edge
at a distance d, appreciable DR is generated when the condition: d . γ¯λ is fulﬁlled, where
¯λ = λ/2π, and λ is the observed wavelength. Table I. presents typical wavelengths of DR
observed from a slit whose width a = 2d = 2mm for a variety of lepton and hadron beams.
Table I. shows, for example, that DR is produced in the optical part of the spectrum (i.e.
IR to visible) for electrons with energies in the range of 0.5 - 5 GeV.

When the observed DR wavelength is much smaller than the transverse or longitudinal
size of a charged particle bunch, incoherent DR is produced independently from each particle
and the total intensity I ∼ N, the number of particles in the bunch. For wavelengths
comparable to the bunch dimensions coherent DR is observed with an intensity I ∼ N 2. The
DR diagnostic methods we will present can utilize either incoherent or coherent DR. However,
for simplicity and to illustrate and emphasize the basic methodology we will concern ourselves
here only with the analysis of incoherent DR. Furthermore, since we have discussed DR
diagnostics using circular apertures elsewhere [10], we will focus our attention in this paper
to the generation of DR from slits. An extended analysis of coherent DR from a slit will be
presented in a future work.

3 Theory of Backward Diﬀraction Radiation from an

Inclined Slit

3.1

Parallel orientation of slit with respect to the plane of incidence

A relativistic charged particle passing through a slit in a conducting screen emits diﬀraction
radiation in the forward and backward directions, the latter in the direction of specular
reﬂection of the virtual photons associated with the relativistic particle. The peak intensity
of diﬀraction radiation, like transition radiation, occurs at an angle θ ∼ γ−1, where θ is
measured from the direction of the particle’s velocity vector v for forward DR, and from the
direction of specular reﬂection for backward DR.

Figure 1A. shows a side view, and Figure 1B. a top view, of the cone of backward
diﬀraction radiation emitted by a charge passing through a slit which is inclined at the angle
Ψ with respect to the velocity vector and oriented such that its edge is horizontal or parallel
to the plane of incidence (n, v plane), where n is the unit vector normal to the plane of the
slit, i.e. the (x′, y′) plane. Additionally, the particle passes through the slit with an oﬀset δ in
the vertical (y′) direction measured from the center of the slit which is deﬁned by the x′ axis.
For simplicity, we have not drawn the forward directed cone of DR which is also generated in
the direction v. Figures 1A. and 1B. show the coordinate system (x, y, z) used to describe
the radiation ﬁelds associated with the wave vector k observed in the backward direction
(i.e. directed along the z axis). The slit is assumed to be an inﬁnitely thin conducting screen
with inﬁnite extent in the x′ and y′ directions beyond the slit aperture.

Our calculation of the backward reﬂected DR ﬁelds employs three diﬀerent concepts (a)
the Huygens-Fresnel diﬀraction approach, following the treatment given by Ter-Mikaelian [4]
for the case of forward DR, (b) the concept of backward reﬂected pseudo photons, used by
Wartski [13] to calculate reﬂected transition radiation and (c) a form of Babinet’s principle.
Our approach is quite diﬀerent and mathematically much less complex than the exact Wiener
Hopf method used by previous researchers to calculate backward DR from a single edge [2,4].
In addition, our method is generally applicable to other geometries where the Wiener Hopf
technique is very diﬃcult to implement.

Consider a thin reﬂecting metal screen S∞with inﬁnite extent. A charged particle crossing
this surface produces the well known forward and backward transition radiation. Compare
this to the case of Fig. 1., where the slit has an area S1 and the conducting screen has an
area S2. Babinet’s principle states that the transition radiation (TR) ﬁeld from the inﬁnite
conducting screen, S∞, can be obtained from a Huygen’s Fresnel integral over the inﬁnite

E 1
area S∞ = S1 + S2, so that the TR ﬁeld can be expressed as

E 2 are those parts of the ﬁeld which are obtained from a Huygen’s Fresnel integral

over the areas S1 and S2, respectively [8].
If material of area S1 is removed, then the ﬁeld

ﬁeld and Wartski’s method of calculating backward reﬂected radiation, we can express the

where Eix,iy are the components of the ﬁeld of the incoming charged particle and kx and ky are
the components of the wave vector k in the plane normal to the direction z shown in Figure
1A. and 1B. As is the case for TR, there are generally three components to the radiation:
direct, reﬂected and transmitted. However, for an opaque, highly conducting screen, the
dominant term for backward TR or DR production is the reﬂected component. The ﬁelds Ex
and Ey for backward TR and DR are thus proportional to the Fresnel reﬂection coeﬃcients
rk and r⊥, respectively. In Eq. (1), the integral over the area S2 is done in terms of the
coordinates (x, y) of Figures 1 and 2. The far ﬁeld reﬂected spectral intensity of DR is found
by integrating the ﬂux of pseudo photons reﬂected oﬀ the surface S2, which pass through
the plane that is perpendicular to the direction z, i.e. the direction of specular reﬂection of
incident pseudo photons having a wave vector k, which is parallel or closely parallel to the
velocity vector v. The phase term in Eq. (1), which is a function of −→ρ = (x′, y′), a vector
lying in the plane of the screen, can be related to the coordinates (x, y) by the transformations
x = x′ sin(Ψ), y = y ′, and the diﬀerential elements of area by dxdy = dx′dy ′ sin(Ψ). The
detailed solution of the integral in Eq. (1) is presented in the Appendix.

The equations for vertically polarized forward diﬀraction radiation intensity, ﬁrst ob-
tained by Ter-Mikaelian [4] and later rewritten and presented in Ref. [9], are both equiva-
lent to Eq. (5 ) without the factor |r⊥|2. Note, however, that the equations for phase term,
Φ(kx, ky) presented in Ref. [9] are incorrect. The correct relationships are given in Eq. (6).

3.1.1 Limiting Forms for Backward DR at 450

Under the usual small angle approximation for observation of TR and DR from relativistic
particles, i.e. v ≈ c, θ ∼ γ−1 ≪ 1, the quantities kx ≈ kx ≈ kθx, ky ≈ kθy, and kz ≈ k. We
then can consider several limiting forms for backward DR.

(1) Single Edge Limit: When either a1 or a2 → ∞ , the sinusoidal term in Eqs. (4)
and (5), which represents the interference between the intensities from each edge of the slit,
disappears and expressions for the horizontal and vertical intensities of DR from a single
edge are obtained. The addition of the horizontal and vertical intensities taken in this limit
produces an expression for the total DR intensity which is identical to that obtained using
the exact Wiener Hopf approach (see Ref. [8], Eq. (14)). The correspondence of the results
of our calculations to those calculated using exact theory is a strong conﬁrmation of the
validity of our method for calculating backward reﬂected DR.

5

(2) Small Displacement Limit: When δ, the particle displacement from the center of the
slit, is small, i.e. δ ≪ γ¯λ ∼ a, the hyperbolic cosine in Eqs. (4) and (5) can be expanded
in a Taylor series. Retaining terms only up to second order, and using the small angle
approximations given above, Eqs. (4) and (5) become:

(3) TR Limit: Additionally, when R << 1 and δ << γ¯λ , Eqs. (7) and (8) each reduce to
one half the intensity of TR, which is the expected correct limit. In this regime the particle
radiates as if the slit in the screen were absent.

3.2 Perpendicular orientation of the slit with respect to the plane of incidence

Figures 2A. and 2B. illustrate the case in which the slit is oriented such that the edge is
perpendicular to the plane of incidence, i.e. the plane containing v and n the normal to the
plane of the screen. In this case, the oﬀset ε of the particle velocity vector from the center
of the slit is in the direction Y ′ and the radiation ﬁelds Ex and Ey can be shown to be the
same as those given above in Eqs. (2) and (3) but with a1 → a1 sin Ψ, a2 → a2 sin Ψ and
δ → ε sin Ψ. Also, Ex ∝ r⊥(ω, Ψ) and Ey ∝ rk(ω, Ψ) since, for this orientation of the slit,
−→
−→
E x is perpendicular and
Ey is parallel, respectively, to the plane of incidence. Then Ex and
Ey take the same forms as Eqs. (2) and (3), with the coeﬃcients r⊥ and rk interchanged.
Similarly the vertical and horizontal intensity components take on the same forms as Eqs.

In Ref.

(4) and (5), with the coeﬃcients |r⊥|2 and (cid:12)(cid:12)rk(cid:12)(cid:12)

[8] it has been shown that an exact calculation of reﬂected DR produced by a
particle traveling with a velocity with a parallel component along the direction of the edge
of a semi-inﬁnite screen [2] reduces, in the limit γ >> 1, to the same result as that of a
particle whose velocity vector is purely perpendicular to the edge (see Eqs.(7) and (14) of

2

interchanged.

6

Ref.[8]). The former situation corresponds to the geometry of Figure 1. as discussed above in
Section 3.1; the latter situation corresponds to the geometry of Figure 2., which is discussed
in this Section. As in the parallel case, the single edge results for the geometry of Fig. 2.
are completely reproduced using our approach in the limit a1 or a2 → ∞. Furthermore, in
the perpendicular incidence case the small angle, relativistic limit produces the same forms
for the horizontal and vertical intensities as the parallel incidence case, i.e. Eqs. (7) and
2 interchanged. In addition, when R << 1, the
horizontal and vertical intensities each go to the same TR limit as in the parallel incidence
case. These results provide further evidence of the soundness of our theoretical approach.

(8), but with the coeﬃcients |r⊥|2 and (cid:12)(cid:12)rk(cid:12)(cid:12)

For the sake of simplicity and to illustrate the main results of our analysis of DR from
slits, we will present numerical examples only for the case of the slit oriented with its edge
parallel to the plane of incidence . However, numerical results can easily be obtained for the
perpendicular orientation by simple substitution of variables as listed above.

4 Discussion and Computational Results

4.1 General properties of DR

mirrored surface. In the case |r⊥|2 ≃ (cid:12)(cid:12)rk(cid:12)(cid:12)

Eqs. (5) and (6) indicate that the highest yield of backward DR observed in the IR to visible
part of the spectrum will be generated when the surface of the slit is a highly conducting
2 ≃ 1. and for γ >> 1, Eqs. (7) and (8) show
that the polarization components are the same as forward DR. These equations also reveal
some interesting characteristics of DR from a slit, which have not been fully discussed in
previous studies, and which can be easily visualized with the help of three dimensional plots
of intensity observed in the X, Y plane.

Figs. 3A. and 3B. show the horizontal and vertical components, respectively, of the
intensity of DR for a value of the ratio R = a/(γ¯λ) = 0.5. Similarly, Figs. 4A. and 4B. show
the component intensities for R = 2.0 . The intensity axis (Z) in these Figures is scaled in
proportion to the corresponding intensity component of transition radiation. For example,
Fig. 3A indicates that the peak intensities of horizontal and vertical DR, respectively, are
about 25% and 80% that of TR , when R = 0.5. Figures 3. and 4. also show that diﬀraction
fringes are present in both polarization components, but are only observed in the Y direction
(perpendicular to the slit edge) for both the orientations shown in Figs. 1 and 2. This can be
deduced directly by an examination of the term sin(RY + Φ′(X, Y )) in Eqs. (7) and (8), i.e.
the frequency of oscillation is determined solely by the value of ky component of the wave
vector represented through the variable R. Secondly, the inteferences in the horizontal and
vertical intensities are 1800 out of phase. This is evident by the presence of the diﬀerence
in the sign of the sinusoidal terms in each component. Thus, in general, the maxima of the
vertical component along the Y axis occur at the minima of the horizontal component.

One further observes that the equation for horizontal intensity, Eq.(7) contains the factor
X 2/(1 + X 2) , which is not present in Eq.(8) for the vertical intensity. This term, which

7

is similar to the form of TR, forces the horizontal component to have a null at X = 0 for
every value of Y . A comparison of the ratio of vertical to horizontal intensities reveals that
the vertical component is larger than the horizontal component, and that ratio becomes
smaller as R decreases approaching unity as R → 0 , i.e. the transition radiation limit.
Also, as R becomes large the DR intensity drops oﬀ exponentially. Thus the value of R
should be kept to a minimum to maximize the observed intensity of DR. We have chosen
the values R = 0.5 and 2.0 to show that measurable horizontal and vertical intensity levels
can be achieved for reasonable experimental conditions and to demonstrate that the ratio
of vertical to horizontal intensity depends on the value of R. For example, a value of R = 2
applies to the case when the beam energy Eb = 500 MeV , the slit width a = 2mm and the
wavelength λ ≃ 3µm. By change of the parameters a and λ, or by use of diﬀerent values
of R , other workable combinations are possible for a given beam energy. Note that as the
beam energy increases, a smaller value of R can be achieved for the same wavelength and
slit size. Since the intensity of DR, like TR, is proportional to γ2 (see Eqs. (7) and (8)), DR
becomes progressively more intense as hence easier to detect as the beam energy increases.
In general, the sum of horizontal and vertical polarization intensity components will
be observed by a detector in the X, Y plane. Thus, if the angular distribution of DR is
imaged, e.g. by using a camera with a lens focussed at inﬁnity, the sum of horizontal and
vertical distributions will be superimposed. However, either distribution can be imaged
separately by placing a rotatable polarizer in front of the lens. We will show that each
of these intensity components provides information about the beam size and divergence in
each of two orthogonal directions and, furthermore, that all of these beam parameters can
be measured by proper analysis of the horizontally and vertically polarized intensities.

4.2 Eﬀect of Beam Parameters on the Angular Distribution of DR

4.2.1 Beam Size

The above discussion shows that both the horizontal and vertical DR spectral-angular dis-
tributions are functions of the beam position δ relative to the center of the slit. This eﬀect
has been previously considered [9,11] as a possible diagnostic of the beam position and size.
In Ref. [9] it was shown that the eﬀects of beam size and oﬀset on the angular distribution
of DR are the same. Also, in Ref. [11] it was shown that the DR intensity is a minimum for
a beam centered in the slit, i.e. zero oﬀset. Since the beam can be centered by monitoring
and steering the beam to minimize the total intensity, the oﬀset can be nulliﬁed or otherwise
determined, for example, by use of a standard wall current monitor. The remaining eﬀects on
the angular distribution of the DR will then be the beam size in the direction perpendicular
to the slit edge and the two orthogonal components of the beam divergence.

To determine the eﬀect of beam size on the intensity components, we assume that the
beam centroid has been centered in the slit by means of one of the previous methods described
above and that any particle within the ﬁnite beam spatial distribution has the same eﬀect
as the oﬀset of a single particle. We further assume that the beam has a separable spatial
distribution given by S = S1(δ) · S2(ε), where δ and ε are in the directions y′ and x′,

8

respectively. For the parallel orientation of the slit, δ and ε are perpendicular and parallel,
respectively, to the slit edge. Integration of the distribution S over δ and ε produces the
average beam sizes hδi and hεi. Because of the simple dependence of the above expressions
for horizontal and vertical intensity on the variable δ, an integration of S over the intensity
components is mathematically equivalent to a simple replacement the variable δ with its
average value hδi. To simplify the notation in the remainder of the text we will identify and
refer to δ and ε as the othogonal rms beam size components, which are perpendicular and
parallel, respectively, to the plane of incidence.

4.2.2 Beam Divergence

Ref. [9] has examined the eﬀect of beam size perpendicular to the edge of a slit on the vertical
intensity component of forward DR in the absence of divergence. A discussion of the eﬀect
of beam size on the horizontal component was dismissed because of its much lower intensity
in comparison to the vertical intensity - an eﬀect which was due to the rather large value of
R = 2π used in the analysis. However, for any realistic beam, the divergence is not negligible
and aﬀects both the horizontal and vertical intensities of DR. Furthermore, in general, the
horizontal component of DR is not negligible in comparison to the vertical component and,
as we will show, this component provides important information on the component of beam
divergence parallel to the slit edge. It is therefore important to analyze both the eﬀect of
beam size and divergence on the vertical and horizontal intensity components to fully assess
the diagnostic potential of DR.

The eﬀect of divergence must be taken into account by performing a two dimensional
convolution of a distribution of particle trajectory angles projected in the X, Z and Y, Z
planes (e.g. separable Gaussian distributions in θx and θy). However, we have shown by
numerical calculation that the eﬀect of the rms divergence δ′ on the horizontal component
of the DR intensity, and the eﬀect of the rms divergence ε′ on the vertical component is
insigniﬁcant for δ′, ε′ . 0.2, a value which is large by the standards of most high quality
accelerators. Then, to a good approximation, a one dimensional convolution of a line scan
of the horizontal or vertical intensity calculated either in the plane deﬁned by Y = const.
or X = const. can in principal be used to predict the eﬀects of the beam divergences ε′
and δ′, respectively. Inversely, these divergences can be determined by ﬁtting the convolved
intensities to measured data.

Horizontal Intensity Component The eﬀect of the divergence ε′, the component par-
allel to the incidence plane, on the horizontal intensity component can be estimated by
neglecting the beam size term. Consider the term X 2 in the numerator of the horizontal
component Eq.(7). Because of the presence of this term, a convolution of the horizontal
intensity component with a distribution of particle angles G(X, ε′) will have the maximum
eﬀect on this component. Furthermore, the eﬀect of ε′ will be maximized near the cen-
ter of the pattern where the horizontal intensity goes to zero in the absence of divergence.
One can estimate this eﬀect by setting the variable Y in Eq. (7) equal to a constant value

9

Y = δ′ = const., and noting the eﬀect on a line scan of the one dimensional convolution of
the horizontal intensity with e.g. the Gaussian distribution: G(X, ε′) = 1√2πε′2 exp(−X 2

Figure 5. shows two such normalized scans of a 1D convolution of horizontal intensity
(Eq. (7)) with G for two diﬀerent values of the variable, Y = δ′ = 0.2 and Y = 0.
In
this calculation, R = 2.0 and ε′ = 0.1. As Fig. 5. shows, there is no discernible diﬀerence
between the two patterns. Then only a small error will be made by setting the variable Y
equal to a constant and performing a one dimensional convolution over X to infer the eﬀect
of the divergence ε′. Inversely, it is possible to measure the divergence, ε′ from line scans of
horizontally polarized DR for a number of Y values by comparing the measured intensity
scans to theoretically convolved line scans in the variable X , which are parameterized by
the variable ε′.

2ε′2 ).

Now consider the eﬀect of the beam size δ measured perpendicular the plane of incidence,
which is also perpendicular to the slit edge for the orientation shown in Fig. 1., on the
horizontal intensity. Note that the eﬀect of beam size ε or any displacement parallel to the
slit edge has no eﬀect on this component. To compare the eﬀect of the beam size δ with eﬀect
of the divergence ε′, consider a line scan of the horizontal intensity component observed over
a ﬁnite bandwidth (∆ω) taken in the plane, Y = 0. Eq. (7) then reduces to:

A convolution of this expression with the Gaussian distribution, G(X, ε′), evaluated at

X = 0, to ﬁrst order in ε′2, gives

dNHoriz.

⊗ G(X, ε′) ∝ ε′2[1 + (

(11)

Thus, while it is still present, the eﬀect of the beam size δ on the horizontal component
will be much smaller than that of the divergence ε′. Figure 6. shows how a change in the
divergence ε′ aﬀects the horizontal intensity for a ﬁxed value of the beam size δ = 300µ. As
predicted from Eq.(11), the eﬀect of ε′ is maximum near the origin. Conversely, the shape
of pattern shape in the vicinity of the origin can be used to separate out and measure the
divergence ε′.

Figure 7. shows the eﬀect of the beam size, δ on a line scan of the horizontal intensity
(Eq. (12)) taken in the X, Z plane, i.e. Y = 0, when ε′ = 0 and R = 2. Figure 7. shows
that a change in δ has no eﬀect on the horizontal component in the region near X = 0, but
does aﬀect the peak value of the intensity observed at |X| ≈ 1 and the fall oﬀ of intensity
for |X| > 1, for δ > 50µ. Numerical calculations indicate similar variation of the intensities
with beam size and divergence for R = 0.5. Therefore, for simplicity, we will only present
below numerical results for a single value of the parameter R = 2.

Vertical Intensity Component A procedure similar to the one described above can be
used to show that the eﬀect of the divergence ε′ has a minimal eﬀect on the vertical intensity

10

distribution. Figure 8. shows two scans of the vertical intensity observed in Figure 4B in
the planes X = ε′ = 0.2 and X = 0. As similarly shown in Fig. 5., the diﬀerence in the two
scans is very small. Thus, it should be possible to use a one dimensional convolution to infer
the eﬀect of the divergence δ′, on line scans of vertically polarized DR (measured in the Y
direction) for a number of X values.

By comparing the measured intensity scans to a set of one dimensional convolutions in
Y parameterized by the divergence component δ′, one would hope to be able to measure
this quantity. However, for the vertical intensity component the eﬀect of the beam size δ is
comparable to that of the divergence δ′. To see this consider an observation of the vertical
intensity component (Eq. (8)) in the Y, Z plane i.e. X = 0. For a ﬁnite bandwidth (∆ω)
measurement, Eq. (8) produces the vertical angular distribution

(12)

To compute the eﬀect of the divergence δ′ one must take the convolution of Eq. (12) with
a distribution over the variable Y , e.g. the Gaussian distribution. G(Y, δ′) = 1√2πδ′2 exp(−Y 2
2δ′2 ).
We have performed this computation numerically to see how the eﬀects of beam size and
divergence compare. Figure 9. shows a vertical intensity scan taken at X = 0, for a ﬁxed
value of the beam size δ =200µ and R = 2.0 for several values of divergence δ′. Figure 10.
shows the eﬀect of a change in the beam size, δ on similar scans for the divergence value
δ′ = 0. A comparison of Figs. 9. and 10. clearly indicates that the eﬀect of divergences
δ′ < 0.2 will compete signiﬁcantly with the eﬀect of beam sizes δ . 300µ on the angular
distribution of the vertical intensity component. Thus, in general, neither eﬀect can be
neglected and the two eﬀects are not separable for this component.

4.3 Strategies for separating beam size and divergence eﬀects

4.3.1 Use of slit oriented perpendicular to the plane of incidence

In order to help separate out the competing eﬀects of beam size and divergence, we have
considered two alternative strategies. One method is to rotate the slit (or insert another
into the beam line) so that the slit edge is perpendicular to the plane of incidence (see Fig.
2A.). In this conﬁguration the horizontal intensity component of the DR, convolved with
the Gaussian function, G(X, δ′) = 1√2πδ′2 exp(−X 2
2δ′2 ), can be used to measure the divergence
δ′, which is now the component of divergence measured parallel to the slit edge. For this
orientation the horizontal component is highly sensitive to δ′ and only weakly depend on the
beam size ε , which is now the component of the beam size perpendicular to the slit edge.
Evaluating the convolved horizontal intensity at X = 0, we obtain

dNHoriz.

dΩ

⊗ G(X, δ′) ∝ δ′2[1 + (

ε
γ¯λ

)2].

(13)

11

Eq.(13) is the direct analog of Eq.(11) above which, as shown in the previous section, can be
used to determine ε′. For the perpendicular orientation of the slit edge, however, the center
of the horizontal AD pattern is sensitive to, and can be used to measure, the divergence
component δ′.

The vertical DR intensity component for this orientation of the slit is:

],

(14)

which is the direct analog of Eq. (12). A one dimensional convolution of Eq. (14) with
the Gaussian distribution G(Y, ε′) = 1√2πε′2 exp(−Y 2
2ε′2 ), produces a pattern that is sensitive to
the divergence ε′ as well as the beam size ε. Thus for the perpendicular slit orientation the
divergence ε′ and beam size ε have comparable eﬀects and it is not possible to distinguish
between them using the vertical intensity component alone.

4.3.2 DR Interferometry

The second strategy we have devised to separate out and measure divergence is to use the
interference of DR produced from two slits inclined at 450 with respect to the beam velocity
in a conﬁguration which is the direct DR analogy to a Wartski OTR interferometer[13].
In such a system forward DR from the ﬁrst slit reﬂects from the second slit surface and
interferes with backward DR generated from the second slit. The interferences produced by
the two intensities will be superimposed on the single slit DR intensity. Figure 11. shows
one possible conﬁguration for a DR interferometer composed of two slits oriented with their
edges parallel to the plane of incidence. The equation for interference DR, in analogy to
TR, is obtained by multiplying Eqs. (7) and (8) by an additional interference term which is
due to the diﬀerence in phase between forward and backward DR. The expressions for the
horizontal and vertical intensity components are of the form:

dN (I)

Horiz,V ert

dΩ

= 4

dN (S)

Horiz,V ert

dΩ

sin2(

L
2LV

)

(15)

where the superscript I refers to the two slit (interferometer), and S to the single slit angular
intensity distributions, respectively, LV ≡ λ/π(γ−2 + θ2) is the coherence length in vacuum
for TR and DR, which respresents the distance over which the particle’s ﬁeld and the TR
or DR photon diﬀer in phase by one radian and L is the path length between the slits.

For a ﬁxed wavelength and energy the single slit term varies slowly with the angle θ. Then
a convolution of Eq.(15) with a distribution of beam angles will chieﬂy eﬀect the interference
term sin2( L
). The interference fringe visibility is then a function of the angular divergence
2LV
and is independent of beam size eﬀects. Thus it should be possible to use DR interferences
to obtain a measurement of the beam divergence alone. Also as is the case with interference

12

OTR, measurements of the two polarized components of interference DR can be used to
measure orthogonal components of the beam divergence[14]. The interference fringes, which
are superimposed on the single slit angular distribution, provide increased sensitivity to
angular diﬀerences in the particle trajectory angles and therefore smaller values of divergence
(δ′,ε′ . 0.05) can be measured with an interferometer than with a single slit alone.

Figures 12. and 13. show the vertical and horizontal components of intensity, respectively,
from a DR interferometer produced by an electron beam with energy E = 500 MeV, R = 2,
λ=3.2µm, δ=200µ and δ′=0.05. The separation distance L = 6LV = 3 meters for this beam
energy. In any DR interferometer the angular distribution of the forward DR from the ﬁrst
foil will be partially cut oﬀ by the presence of the second slit in such a conﬁguration. If the
path length between the slits is large, the total angular ﬁeld will only be cut oﬀ in the center
of the pattern by a small amount. Thus only a small fraction of the interference patterns
(1/6γ for the parameter range speciﬁed above) will be cut out. This eﬀect is not shown in
Figs. 12. and 13.

In contrast to the very weak eﬀect of a small value of divergence, i.e. δ′ = 0.05, on single
slit DR (see Figs. 7. and 9.), the eﬀect of this divergence on the DR interference fringe
visibility is clearly visible. Since the fringes are well modulated out to Y ∼ 4, the cutoﬀ of
the ﬁeld of view due to the second aperture will have a negligible eﬀect on a measurement
of the divergence, which uses the interference pattern. With the help of a second camera or
imager, a simultaneous measurement of backward DR from the ﬁrst slit can be made and
thereby provide addition single slit data for extracting the beam size.

At the present time the use of the angular distribution of DR for diagnostics is practically
limited to beams with moderate to high energies by the vacuum coherence length LV ∼ γ2λ.
The DR produced by upstream sources such as beam line discontinuities or other apertures
will destructively interfere with backward DR generated from a diagnostic aperture when
the distance between the upstream source and the aperture is much less than LV . Also, the
successful application of interference DR to measure beam divergences δ′, ε′ . 0.05 requires
that the inter-aperture distance L & 5LV . Therefore, the diagnostic techniques described in
this paper are limited to observation wavelengths and beam energies which do not give rise
to an impracticably long coherence length for the accelerator facility being used. The means
to overcome this limit must be developed before the methods described here can be applied
to beams with very high energy.

5 Summary

We have developed a new method to calculate backward reﬂected diﬀraction radiation from
any type of aperture. Using this method we have derived the equations for backward hori-
zontal and vertically polarized spectral-angular intensities of DR from a slit inclined at an
arbitrary angle with respect to the particle velocity. We have obtained results for two orthog-
onal orientations of the slit edges, i.e. parallel and perpendicular to the plane of incidence.
The results of our calculations reduce in the single edge limit precisely to those previously

13

derived using the exact Wiener Hopf method. However, in contrast to the Wiener Hopf
approach, which has been successfully used to calculate DR from one type of aperture only,
i.e. the single edge, our approach is readily applicable to any type of aperture and is much
simpler to employ.

From an analysis of backward DR for the two orientations of the slit mentioned above,
we have developed a number of strategies to determine four unknown beam parameters of
interest: the two orthogonal beam divergences, δ′, ε′, which are perpendicular and parallel
to the incidence plane, respectively, and the two corresponding orthogonal components of
the beam size: δ, ε. These strategies require the measurement of the horizontally and ver-
tically polarized intensities from a single slit or a double slit DR interferometer. We have
demonstrated that one dimensional convolved scans of the horizontal intensities in either
the X = const. or Y = const. plane can be used to separately measure δ′ and ε′, respec-
tively. With the divergences known, the corresponding beam size components δ and ε can
be inferred. Since each of these scans can be produced at multiple angles in the plane of
observation, a large amount of data is available which can be used to reduce the error in the
measurement of all the beam parameters of interest. The stategies we have developed are
useful for moderate to high energy lepton or hadron beams.

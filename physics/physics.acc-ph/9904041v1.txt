NONLINEAR ACCELERATOR PROBLEMS VIA WAVELETS:
3. EFFECTS OF INSERTION DEVICES ON BEAM DYNAMICS

A. Fedorova, M. Zeitlin, IPME, RAS, St. Petersburg, Russia ∗ †

Abstract

In this series of eight papers we present the applications
of methods from wavelet analysis to polynomial approxi-
mations for a number of accelerator physics problems. In
this part, assuming a sinusoidal ﬁeld variation, we consider
the analytical treatment of the effects of insertion devices
on beam dynamics. We investigate via wavelet approach
a dynamical model which has polynomial nonlinearities
and variable coefﬁcients. We construct the corresponding
wavelet representation. As examples we consider wigglers
and undulator magnets. We consider the further modiﬁca-
tion of our variational approach which may be applied in
each scale.

INTRODUCTION

This is the third part of our eight presentations in which
we consider applications of methods from wavelet anal-
ysis to nonlinear accelerator physics problems. This is a
continuation of our results from [1]-[8], which is based on
our approach to investigation of nonlinear problems – gen-
eral, with additional structures (Hamiltonian, symplectic or
quasicomplex), chaotic, quasiclassical, quantum, which are
considered in the framework of local (nonlinear) Fourier
analysis, or wavelet analysis. Wavelet analysis is a rela-
tively novel set of mathematical methods, which gives us a
possibility to work with well-localized bases in functional
spaces and with the general type of operators (differential,
integral, pseudodifferential) in such bases. In this part we
consider effects of insertion devices (section 2) on beam
dynamics. In section 3 we consider generalization of our
variational approach for the case of variable coefﬁcients. In
section 4 we consider more powerful variational approach
which is based on ideas of para-products and approxima-
tion for multiresolution approach, which gives us possibil-
ity for computations in each scale separately.

2 EFFECTS OF INSERTION DEVICES

ON BEAM DYNAMICS

Assuming a sinusoidal ﬁeld variation, we may consider ac-
cording to [9] the analytical treatment of the effects of in-
sertion devices on beam dynamics. One of the major detri-

mental aspects of the installation of insertion devices is
the resulting reduction of dynamic aperture. Introduction
of non-linearities leads to enhancement of the amplitude-
dependent tune shifts and distortion of phase space. The
nonlinear ﬁelds will produce signiﬁcant effects at large be-
tatron amplitudes. The components of the insertion device
magnetic ﬁeld used for the derivation of equations of mo-
tion are as follows:

· B0 sinh(kxx) sinh(kyy) cos(kz)

Bz = −

with k2
y = k2 = (2π/λ)2, where λ is the period
length of the insertion device, B0 is its magnetic ﬁeld, ρ is
the radius of the curvature in the ﬁeld B0. After a canonical
transformation to change to betatron variables, the Hamil-
tonian is averaged over the period of the insertion device
and hyperbolic functions are expanded to the fourth order
in x and y (or arbitrary order). Then we have the following
Hamiltonian:

We have in this case also nonlinear (polynomial with de-
gree 3) dynamical system with variable (periodic) coefﬁ-
cients. As related cases we may consider wiggler and un-
dulator magnets. We have in horizontal x − s plane the
following equations

3 VARIABLE COEFFICIENTS

In the case when we have situation when our problem is de-
scribed by a system of nonlinear (polynomial)differential

So, the general scheme is the same one and we have only
one more additional linear algebraic problem by which we
in the same way can parameterize the solutions of corre-
sponding problem. As example we demonstrate on Fig. 1 a
simple model of (local) intersection and the corresponding
multiresolution representation (MRA).

equations, we need to consider extension of our previous
approach which can take into account any type of variable
coefﬁcients (periodic, regular or singular). We can pro-
duce such approach if we add in our construction additional
reﬁnement equation, which encoded all information about
variable coefﬁcients [10]. According to our variational ap-
proach we need to compute integrals of the form

bij(t)(ϕ1)d1(2mt − k1)(ϕ2)d2 (2mt − k2)dx,

(4)

ZD

where now bij (t) are arbitrary functions of time, where trial
functions ϕ1, ϕ2 satisfy a reﬁnement equations:

ϕi(t) =

aikϕi(2t − k)

(5)

Xk∈Z

If we consider all computations in the class of compactly
supported wavelets then only a ﬁnite number of coefﬁcients
do not vanish. To approximate the non-constant coefﬁ-
cients, we need choose a different reﬁnable function ϕ3
along with some local approximation scheme

(Bℓf )(x) :=

Fℓ,k(f )ϕ3(2ℓt − k),

(6)

Xα∈Z

where Fℓ,k are suitable functionals supported in a small
neighborhood of 2−ℓk and then replace bij in (4) by
Bℓbij(t). In particular case one can take a characteristic
function and can thus approximate non-smooth coefﬁcients
locally. To guarantee sufﬁcient accuracy of the resulting
approximation to (4) it is important to have the ﬂexibility
of choosing ϕ3 different from ϕ1, ϕ2. In the case when D
is some domain, we can write

bij(t) |D=

bij(t)χD(2ℓt − k),

(7)

X0≤k≤2ℓ

where χD is characteristic function of D. So, if we take
ϕ4 = χD, which is again a reﬁnable function, then the
problem of computation of (4) is reduced to the problem of
calculation of integral

H(k1, k2, k3, k4) = H(k) =

ϕ4(2jt − k1)ϕ3(2ℓt − k2) ×

The key point is that these integrals also satisfy some sort

4 EVALUATION OF NONLINEARITIES

SCALE BY SCALE

We consider scheme of modiﬁcation of our variational ap-
proach in the case when we consider different scales sep-
arately. For this reason we need to compute errors of ap-
proximations. The main problems come of course from
nonlinear terms. We follow the approach from [11].

Let Pj be projection operators on the subspaces Vj , j ∈

Pj

µ = d1 + d2.

Xℓ∈Z

(Pjf )(x) =

Xk

This equation can be interpreted as the problem of com-
puting an eigenvector. Thus, we reduced the problem of
extension of our method to the case of variable coefﬁcients
to the same standard algebraical problem as in the preced-
ing sections.

and Qj are projection operators on the subspaces Wj :

Qj = Pj−1 − Pj

(11)

So, for u ∈ L2(R) we have uj = Pju
and uj ∈ Vj,
where {Vj}, j ∈ Z is a multiresolution analysis of L2(R).

It is obviously that we can represent u2
form:

In this formula there is no interaction between different
scales. We may consider each term of (12) as a bilinear
mappings:

Vj0−1 → Vj0−1 we need signiﬁcantly fewer coefﬁcients
than for mappings (20), (21). It is enough to consider only
coefﬁcients

M (k, k′, ℓ) = 2−j/2

ϕ(x − k)ϕ(x − k′)ϕ(x − ℓ)dx,

(24)

where ϕ(x) is scale function. Also we have

M (k, k′, ℓ) = 2−j/2M0(k − ℓ, k′ − ℓ),

(R) = Vj ⊕j′≥jWj′

(13)

where

M j

W W : Wj × Wj → L2(R) = Vj ⊕j′≥j Wj′

(14)

For numerical purposes we need formula (12) with a ﬁnite
number of scales, but when we consider limits j → ∞ we
have

(2Pju + Qju)(Qju),

(15)

u2 =

Xj∈Z

which is para-product of Bony, Coifman and Meyer.

Now we need to expand (12) into the wavelet bases. To
expand each term in (12) into wavelet basis, we need to
consider the integrals of the products of the basis functions,
e.g.

′

M j,j

W W W (k, k′, ℓ) =

k(x)ψj
ψj

k′ (x)ψj

ℓ (x)dx,

(16)

′

Z

−∞

where j′ > j and

k(x) = 2−j/2ψ(2−jx − k)
ψj

(17)

are the basis functions. If we consider compactly supported
wavelets then

′

M j,j

W W W (k, k′, ℓ) ≡ 0 for

|k − k′| > k0,

(18)

where k0 depends on the overlap of the supports of the basis
functions and

|M r

W W W (k − k′, 2rk − ℓ)| ≤ C · 2−rλM

(19)

Let us deﬁne j0 as the distance between scales such that for
a given ε all the coefﬁcients in (19) with labels r = j − j′,
r > j0 have absolute values less than ε. For the purposes
of computing with accuracy ε we replace the mappings in
(13), (14) by

M j

M j

V W : Vj × Wj → Vj ⊕j≤j′≤j0 Wj′

W W : Wj × Wj → Vj ⊕J≤j′≤j0 Wj′

Vj ⊕j≤j′≤j0 Wj′ = Vj0−1

Since

and

(20)

(22)

(23)

M0(p, q) =

ϕ(x − p)ϕ(x − q)ϕ(x)dx

Z

Now as in section (3) we may derive and solve a system of
linear equations to ﬁnd M0(p, q) and obtain explicit repre-
sentation for solution.

rrmannsfeldt (SLAC), Mrs. M. Laraneta (UCLA), J. Ko-

We describe the transverse beam distribution in particle accelerators within the controlled,
stochastic dynamical scheme of the Stochastic Mechanics (SM) which produces time reversal in-
variant diﬀusion processes. This leads to a linearized theory summarized in a Shchr¨odinger–like
(S–ℓ) equation. The space charge eﬀects have been introduced in a recent paper [1] by coupling this
S–ℓ equation with the Maxwell equations. We analyze the space charge eﬀects to understand how
the dynamics produces the actual beam distributions, and in particular we show how the stationary,
self–consistent solutions are related to the (external, and space–charge) potentials both when we
suppose that the external ﬁeld is harmonic (constant focusing), and when we a priori prescribe the
shape of the stationary solution. We then proceed to discuss a few new ideas [2] by introducing the
generalized Student distributions, namely non–Gaussian, L´evy inﬁnitely divisible (but not stable)
distributions. We will discuss this idea from two diﬀerent standpoints: (a) ﬁrst by supposing that
the stationary distribution of our (Wiener powered) SM model is a Student distribution; (b) by
supposing that our model is based on a (non–Gaussian) L´evy process whose increments are Student
distributed. We show that in the case (a) the longer tails of the power decay of the Student laws,
and in the case (b) the discontinuities of the L´evy–Student process can well account for the rare
escape of particles from the beam core, and hence for the formation of a halo in intense beams.

INTRODUCTION

In high intensity beams of charged particles, proposed
in recent years for a wide variety of accelerator–related
applications, it is very important to keep at low level the
beam loss to the wall of the beam pipe, since even small
fractional losses in a high–current machine can cause ex-
ceedingly high levels of radioactivation. It is now widely
believed that one of the relevant mechanisms for these
losses is the formation of a low intensity beam halo more
or less far from the core. These halos have been observed
[3] or studied in experiments [4], and have also been sub-
jected to an extensive simulation analysis [5]. For the
next generation of high intensity machines it is however
still necessary to obtain a more quantitative understand-
ing not only of the physics of the halo, but also of the
beam transverse distribution in general [6]. In fact “be-
cause there is not a consensus about its deﬁnition, halo
remains an imprecise term” [7] so that several proposals
have been put forward for its description.

The charged particle beams are usually described in

terms of classical, deterministic dynamical systems. The
standard model is that of a collisionless plasma where the
corresponding dynamics is embodied in a suitable phase
space (see for example [8]). In this framework the beam
is studied by means of the particle–in–core (pic) model
and the simulations show that the instabilities due to a
parametric resonance can allow the particles to escape
from the core with consequent halo formation [5, 6, 7].
The present paper takes a diﬀerent approach: it follows
the idea that the particle trajectories are samples of a
stochastic process, rather than usual deterministic (dif-
In the usual dynamical mod-
ferentiable) trajectories.
els there is a particle probability distribution obeying
the Vlasov equation, and its evolution is Liouvillian in
the sense that the origin of the randomness is just in
the initial conditions: along the time evolution, which is
supposed to be deterministic, there is no new source of
uncertainty. It is the non linear character of the equa-
tions which produces the possible unpredictable charac-
ter of the trajectories. On the other hand in our model
the trajectories are replaced by stochastic processes since
the time evolution is supposed to be randomly perturbed
even after the initial time. It is open to discussion which
one of these two description is more realistic; in particular
we should ask if the mutual interactions among the beam
particles look like random collisions, or rather like con-
tinuous deterministic interactions. In the opinion of the
authors, however, a plasma (with collisions) described in

terms of controlled stochastic processes is a good candi-
date to explain the rare escape of particles from a quasi–
stable beam core by statistically taking into account the
random inter–particle interactions that can not be de-
scribed in detail. Of course the idea of a stochastic ap-
proach is hardly new [8, 9], but there are several diﬀerent
ways to implement it.

First of all let us remark that the system we want to
describe is endowed with some measure of invariance un-
der time reversal, since the external ﬁelds act to keep it
in a quasi–stationary non diﬀusive state despite the re-
pulsive electro–magnetic (e.m.) interactions among the
constituent particles. However, a widespread misconcep-
tion notwithstanding, a theory of stochastic processes not
always describe irreversible systems: the addition of a
dynamics to a stochastic kinematics can in fact ascribe
a measure of time reversal invariance also to a stochas-
tic system [10]. The standard way to build a stochastic
dynamical system is to modify the phase space dynamics
by adding a Wiener noise B(t) to the momentum equa-
tion only, so that the usual relations between position
and velocity is preserved:

m dQ(t) = P(t) dt ,

dP(t) = F(t) dt + β dB(t) .

In this way we get a derivable, but not Markovian po-
sition process Q(t). The standard example of this ap-
proach is that of a Brownian motion in a force ﬁeld de-
scribed by an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck system of stochastic
diﬀerential equations (SDE) [11]. Alternatively we can
add a Wiener noise W(t) with diﬀusion coeﬃcient D to
the position equation:

dQ(t) = v(+)(Q(t), t) dt + √D dW(t) .
and get a Markovian, but not derivable Q(t). In this way
the stochastic system is also reduced to a single SDE
since we are obliged to drop the second (momentum)
in fact now Q(t) is no more derivable. The
equation:
standard example of this reduction is the Smoluchowski
approximation of the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process in the
overdamped case [11]. As a consequence we will work
only in a conﬁguration, and not in a phase space; but
this does not prevent us from introducing a dynamics –
as we will show in the Section II A – either by generalizing
the Newton equations [11, 12], or by means of a stochas-
tic variational principle [13]. Remark that in this scheme
the forward velocity v(+)(r, t) can no more be an a priori
given ﬁeld: rather it now plays the role of a new dy-
namical variable of our system. This second scheme, the
Stochastic mechanics (SM), is universally known for its
original application to the problem of building a classical
stochastic model for Quantum Mechanics (QM), but in
fact it is a very general model which is suitable for a large
number of stochastic dynamical systems [10, 14]. We
will also see in the Section II A that from the stochastic
variational principles two coupled equations are derived
which are equivalent to a Schr¨odinger–like (S–ℓ) diﬀeren-
tial equation: in this sense we will speak of quantum–like

2

(Q-ℓ) systems, in analogy with other recent researches
on this subject [15, 16].
In fact the SM can be used
to describe every stochastic dynamical system satisfying
fairly general conditions: it is known since longtime [17],
for example, that for any given diﬀusion there is a cor-
respondence between diﬀusion processes and solutions of
S–ℓ equations where the Hamiltonians come in general
from suitable vector potentials. Under some regularity
conditions this correspondence is seen to be one-to-one.
The usual Schr¨odinger equation, and hence QM, is recov-
ered when the diﬀusion coeﬃcient coincides with ~/2m,
namely is connected to the Planck constant. However we
are interested here not in a stochastic model of QM, but
in the description of particle beams.

In the present paper we intend to widen the scope
of our SM model by introducing the idea that an im-
portant role for the beam dynamics can be played by
non–Gaussian L´evy distributions. In fact these distribu-
tions enjoyed a widespread popularity in the recent years
because of their multifaceted possible applications to a
large set of problems from the statistical mechanics to
the mathematical ﬁnance (see for example [10, 18] and
references quoted therein).
In particular the so called
stable laws (see Section V A) are used in a large number
of instances, as for example in the deﬁnition of the so–
called L´evy ﬂights. Our research is instead focused on
a family of non–Gaussian L´evy laws which are inﬁnitely
divisible but not stable: the generalize Student laws. As
will be discussed later this will allow us to overcome –
without resorting to the trick of the truncated laws – the
problems raised by the fact that the stable non–Gaussian
laws always have divergent variances: a feature which is
not realistic to ascribe to most real systems. It is possible
to show indeed that by suitably choosing the parameters
of the Student laws we can have distributions with ﬁnite
variance, and approximating the Gaussian law as well
as we want. On the other hand the inﬁnitely divisible
character of these laws is all that is required to build
a stationary, stochastically continuous Markov process
with independent increments, namely the L´evy process
that we propose to use to represent the evolution of our
particle beam.

Of course it is not always mathematically easy to deal
with the inﬁnitely divisible processes, but we will show
that at least in two respects they will help us to have some
further insight in the beam dynamics. First of all we use
the Student distributions in the framework of the tradi-
tional SM where the randomness of process is supplied by
a Gaussian Wiener noise: here we examinate the features
of the self–consistent potentials which can produce a Stu-
dent distribution as stationary transverse distribution of
a particle beam. In this instance the focus of our research
is on the increase of the probability of ﬁnding the par-
ticles at a great distance from the beam core. Then we
pass to the deﬁnition of a true L´evy–Student process, and
we show with a few simulations that these processes can
help to explain how a particle can be expelled from the
bunch because of some kind of hard collision. In fact the

trajectories of our L´evy–Student process show the typi-
cal jumps of the non–Gaussian L´evy processes: a feature
that we propose to use as a model for the halo formation.
In a few previous papers [19] we connected the (trans-
verse) r.m.s. emittance to the characteristic microscopic
scale and to the total number of the particles in a bunch,
and implemented a few techniques of active control for
the dynamics of the beam. In this paper we ﬁrst of all
review the theoretical basis [1, 19] of the proposed model:
in the Section II we deﬁne our SM model with emphasis
added on the potentials which control the beam dynam-
ics and on the possible non stationary solutions of this
model [20]. In the Section III we review our analysis of
the self–consistent, space charge eﬀects due to the e.m.
interaction among the particles, adding a few new results
In the Section IV we then discuss the
and comments.
idea [2] that the laws ruling the transverse distribution
of particle beams are non–Gaussian, inﬁnitely divisible,
L´evy laws as the generalized Student laws. In particular
we analyze the behavior of our usual SM model under
the hypothesis that the stationary transverse distribu-
tion is a Student law. Finally in the Section V we study
the possibility of extending our SM model to L´evy pro-
cesses whose increments are distributed according to the
Student law. We think in particular that the presence
of isolated jumps in the trajectories can help to build a
realistic model for the possible formation of halos in the
particle beams. We end the paper with a few conclusive
remarks.

II. STOCHASTIC BEAM DYNAMICS

A. Stochastic mechanics

First of all we introduce the stochastic process per-
formed by a representative particle that oscillates around
the closed ideal orbit in a particle accelerator. We con-
sider the 3–dimensional (3–DIM) diﬀusion process Q(t),
taking the values r, which describes the position of the
representative particle and whose probability density is
proportional to the particle density of the bunch. As
stated in the Section I the evolution of this process is
ruled by the Itˆo stochastic diﬀerential equation (SDE)

dQ(t) = v(+)(Q(t), t) dt + √D dW(t) ,

(1)

where v(+)(r, t) is the forward velocity, and dW(t)
≡
W(t) is the increment process of a standard

D is supposed to be constant: the quantity α = 2mD,
which has the dimensions of an action, will be later con-
nected to the characteristic transverse emittance of the
beam. The equation (1) deﬁnes the random kinematics
performed by the particle, and replaces the usual deter-

×

ministic kinematics

dq(t) = v(q(t), t)dt

where q(t) is just the trajectory in the 3–DIM space.

To counteract the dissipation due to this stochastic
kinematics, a dynamics must be independently added.
In SM we do not have a phase space: our description
is entirely in a 3-DIM conﬁguration space. This means
in particular that the dynamics is not introduced in a
Hamiltonian way, but by means of a suitable stochastic
least action principle [13] obtained as a generalization of
the variational principle of classical mechanics.
In the
following we will brieﬂy review the main results, refer-
ring for details to the references [10, 11, 13]. Given the
SDE (1), we consider the probability density function
(pdf) ρ(r, t) associated to the diﬀusion Q(t) so that, be-
sides the forward velocity v(+)(r, t), we can now deﬁne a
backward velocity

v(−)(r, t) = v(+)(r, t)

We can then introduce also the current and the osmotic

Here v represents the velocity ﬁeld of the density, while
u is of intrinsic stochastic nature and is a measure of the
non diﬀerentiability of the stochastic trajectories.

A ﬁrst consequence of the stochastic generalization of
the least action principle [11, 13] is that the current ve-
locity takes the following irrotational form:

mv(r, t) =

S(r, t) ,

while the Lagrange equations of motion for the density ρ
and for the current velocity v are the continuity equation

partial diﬀerential equations for the pair (ρ, S) which
completely determines the state of our beam. On the
other hand, because of (5), this state is equivalently given
by the pair(ρ, v).

It can also be shown by simple substitution from (4)
that (6) is equivalent to the standard Fokker–Planck

where f is a dimensionless density deﬁned by

from (3) and (4), we know that also the forward velocity
v(+) is irrotational:

S are connected by the relation

The time–reversal invariance is now made possible [12]
by the fact that the forward drift velocity v(+)(r, t) is no
more an a priori given ﬁeld, as is usual for the diﬀusion
processes of the Langevin type; instead it is dynamically
determined at any instant of time, starting by an initial
condition, through the HJM evolution equation (7). It is
ﬁnally important to remark that, introducing the repre-
sentation [21]

Ψ(r, t) =

ρ(r, t) eiS(r,t)/α ,

(15)

p

(with α = 2mD) the coupled equations (8) and (9) are
made equivalent to a single linear equation of the form
of the Schr¨odinger equation, with the Planck action con-
stant replaced by α:

iα∂tΨ =

2ψ + V Ψ .

(16)

We will refer to it as a Schr¨odinger–like (S–ℓ) equa-
tion: clearly (16) has not the same meaning as the usual
Schr¨odinger equation; this would be true only if α = ~,
while in general α is not an universal constant, and it
is rather a quantity characteristic of the system under
consideration (in our case the particle beam). In fact α
turns out to be of the order of magnitude of the beam

emittance, a quantity which – in formal analogy with ~
– has the dimensions of an action and gives a measure of
the position/momentum uncertainty product for the sys-
tem. Thus the SM model of our beam, as incorporated
in the phenomenological Schr¨odinger equation (16), while
keeping a few features reminiscent of the QM, is in fact
a deeply diﬀerent theory.

B. Controlled distributions

We have introduced the equations that in the SM
model are supposed to describe the dynamical behavior
of the beam: we now brieﬂy sum up a general procedure,
already exploited in previous papers [19, 22], to control
the dynamics of our systems. Let us suppose that the
pdf ρ(r, t) be given all along its time evolution: think
in particular either to a stationary state, or to an en-
gineered evolution from some initial pdf toward a ﬁnal
state with suitable characteristics. We know that the
FP equation (10) must be satisﬁed, for the given ρ, by
some forward velocity ﬁeld v(+)(r, t). Since also the equa-
tion (13) must hold, we are ﬁrst of all required to ﬁnd an
irrotational v(+) which satisﬁes the FP equation (10) for
the given ρ. We then take into account also the dynami-
cal equation (11): since ρ and v(+) (and hence f and W )
are now ﬁxed and satisfy (10), the equation (11) plays
the role of a constraint deﬁning a controlling potential V
when we also take into account the equation (14). We
list here the potentials associated to the three particular
cases which are useful in the following Sections.

In the 1-DIM case with given dimensionless pdf f (x, t)

and a < x < b (a and b can be inﬁnite) we easily get

v(+)(x, t) = D

For a 3-DIM system with cylindrical symmetry around
the z-axis (the beam axis), if we denote with (r, ϕ, z)
the cylindrical coordinates, and if we suppose that ρ(r, t)
depends only on r and t, and that v(+) = v(+)(r, t) ˆr is
radially directed with modulus depending only on r and
t, we have

v(+)(r, t) = D

Finally in the 3-DIM stationary case the pdf ρ(r) is in-

Chapman–Kolmogorov equation by supposing suitable
shapes for the initial and ﬁnal distributions. Then a di-
rect application of (18) allows us to calculate the control
potential corresponding to this evolution. For the sake
of brevity we do not give the analytical form of this po-
tential and refer to the quoted papers for further details.

(21)

(22)

Of course in this context the constant E will be chosen
by ﬁxing the zero of the potential energy. Let us remark
ﬁnally that in this stationary case the phenomenological
wave function (15) takes the form

Ψ(r, t) = √ρ e−iEt/α

typical of the stationary states.

C. Non stationary distributions

In the following we will be mainly concerned with sta-
tionary distributions, but in a few previous paper we
treated also non stationary problems. For instance, if
we consider the stationary, ground state pdf (without
nodes) ρ0(r) of a suitable potential, and if we calculate
v(+)(r) and write down the corresponding FP equation,
it is possible to show (see the general proof in a few pre-
vious papers [22, 23, 24]) that, ρ0(r) will play the role of
an attractor for every other distribution (non extremal
with respect to a stochastic minimal action principle). If
the accelerator beam is ruled by such an equation, this
would imply that the halo can not simply be wiped out
by scraping away the particles that come out of the bunch
core: in fact they simply will keep going out in the halo
until the equilibrium is reached again since the distribu-
tion ρ0(r) is a stable attractor.

In a recent paper [20] we gave an estimate of the time
required for the relaxation of non extremal pdf’s toward
the equilibrium distribution. This is an interesting test
for our model since this relaxation time is ﬁxed once the
form of the forward velocity ﬁeld is given; this is in turn
ﬁxed when the form of the halo distribution is given as
in the reference [1], and one could check if the estimate
is in agreement with possible observed times.
In par-
ticular we estimated that in typical conditions all the
non–stationary solutions of this FP equation will be at-
tracted toward ρ0 with a relaxation time of the order of
10−7sec.
τ

≈
A diﬀerent non stationary problem also discussed in
previous papers [19, 20] consists in the analysis of some
particular time evolution of the process with the aim of
ﬁnding the dynamics that control it. For instance we
studied the possible evolutions which start from a pdf
with halo and evolve toward a halo–free pdf: this would
allow us to ﬁnd the dynamics that we are requested to
apply in order to achieve this result. If for simplicity the
overall process is supposed to be an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck
process, the transition pdf would be completely known
and all the result can be exactly calculated through the

In a ﬁrst ap-

the 3–DIM space will play the role of the number of par-

system of N charged particles is not a pure ensemble
due to their mutual e.m. interaction, in a further mean
ﬁeld approximation we will take into account the so called
space charge eﬀects: more precisely we will couple our S–
ℓ equation with the Maxwell equations describing both
the external and the space charge e.m. ﬁelds, and we will
get in the end a non linear system of coupled diﬀerential
equations.

In our model a single, charged particle embedded in a
beam and feeling both an external, and a space charge
potential is ﬁrst of all described by a S–ℓ equation

ﬁeld.

(38)
(39)

(40)

where b0 is the longitudinal velocity of the beam. We can
now look at our equations in two diﬀerent ways. Firs of
all we can suppose that ve is a given external potential:
in this case our aim is to solve the equations for the two
unknowns w (radial particle distribution) and v (space
charge potential energy). However in general no simple
analytical solution of this problem is at present available
for the usual forms of the external potential ve: there are
not even solutions playing the same role played by the
Kapchinskij–Vladimirskij (KV) distribution in the usual

(32)

(33)

(34)

models. This phase space distribution – which is simple
and self-consistent in the usual dynamical models – leads
to an uniform transverse space distribution of the beam,
and is a stationary solution of the Vlasov equation with a
harmonic potential. Moreover its space charge potential
calculated from the Poisson equation is still harmonic.
Instead in the SM model the uniform distributions are
not solutions of the stationary Schr¨odinger equation, and
we know no simple stationary distribution connected to
the harmonic potential as the KV. Even the gaussian dis-
tributions – later discussed in this paper – can not play
the same role: they are solutions connected with an exter-
nal harmonic potential, but their space charge potential
calculated from the Poisson equation is not harmonic.

Alternatively we can assume as known a given distribu-
tion w, and solve our equations to ﬁnd both the external
and the space charge self–consistent potential energies ve
and v.
In this second form the problem is more sim-
ple, and analytical solutions are available. We adopted
the ﬁrst standpoint in a previous papers [1] where we
numerically solved the equations (38) and (39); here we
will rather elaborate a few new ideas about the second
one. To this end it is important to remark that the space
charge potential energy

is always a solution of the Poisson equation (39) satis-
fying the conditions v(0+) = v′(0+) = 0. On the other
hand, by substituting (41) in the ﬁrst equation (38) we
readily obtain also the self–consistent form of the exter-
nal potential energy

where v0(s) is the potential that we would have with-
out space charge (ξ = 0), while the second part in the
external potential (42) exactly compensate for the space
charge potential.

D. Constant focusing

Let us suppose now that the transverse external poten-
tial Ve(r) is a cylindrically symmetric, harmonic potential
with a proper frequency ω (constant focusing), and let we
also introduce the characteristic length

σ2 =

α
2mω

which will represents a measure of the transverse disper-
in the
sion of the beam. In cylindrical coordinates
transverse plane our potential energy is

r, ϕ

{

Ve(r) =

r2 =

(44)

(45)

so that the corresponding 2–DIM S–ℓ equation without
space charge (zero perveance) would have as lowest eigen-
value E0 = αω, and as ground state wave function

χ00(r, ϕ) =

u0(r)
√2π

=

e−r2/4σ2

.

Of course the self–consistent solution would be diﬀerent
if there is a space charge (non zero perveance). To ﬁnd
this solution one introduces the so called phase advance

These equations are now a coupled, non linear system
which must be numerically solved since we do not know
simple self–consistent solutions of the form of the KV dis-
tribution. In reference [1] we extensively analyzed these
numerical solutions and we refer to this paper for details.
In fact in [1] there was a small diﬀerence with respect to
what has been presented here. The form of the equations
to solve is the same, but the dimensionless formulation
was achieved by means of two numerical constants diﬀer-
ent from (40) and drawn from the characteristics of the
transverse harmonic oscillator force:

η =

α2
4mσ2 =

αω

,

λ = σ√2

(48)

Then the dimensionless quantities have a diﬀerent numer-
ical value and the dimensionless equations (36) and (37)
take the form

s w′′(s) + w′(s) = [s2 + v(s)
−
ξ s w2(s)
s v′′(s) + v′(s) =

β] s w(s)

since now γ = 1. In any case the equations (46) and (47)
can easily be turned into the equations (49) and (50), and
vice versa, by means of simple transformations through
the parameter γ which turns out to be at the same time
the ratio of the energy constants, and that of the squared
length constants. As a consequence in the following we
will always use the system (49), (50), with the advantage
of simply putting γ = 1 in the model.

IV. SELF–CONSISTENT POTENTIALS

A. Gaussian transverse distributions

In the SM model it is possible to numerically integrate
the Schr¨odinger–Poisson system (38) and (39) with a
given external potential and calculate the self–consistent
distributions and their space charge potentials [1]. On
the other hand, if we ﬁx a particular distribution, it is
always possible to exactly calculate from these equations
the external and space charge potential giving rise to that
distribution. When we adopt this second alternative ap-
proach and we take as given the form of the distribution
w(s), the unknowns in the equations (38) and (39) are
the two potential energies v(s) and ve(s).
In this case
we only need to calculate the expressions (41) and (42)
in terms of the given distribution w(s). Of course if we
take an arbitrary w(s) we will not get any simple and
meaningful form for the external potential ve(s); and on
the other hand to guess the right form of w(s) giving
rise, for instance, exactly to a harmonic potential (44) as
external potential would be tantamount to solve (42) as
an integro-diﬀerential equation for a given external po-
tential. However in a few explicit cases the results are
quite simple and interesting.

Let us take as ﬁrst example of a stationary wave func-
tion that of the ground state u0(r) of the harmonic oscil-
lator with zero perveance given in (45). Its dimensionless
representation is:

w(s) = √2 e−s2/2 ,

β = 2 (ET = αω) ;

(51)

which is also apparently normalized. We now want to cal-
culate both the external and the space charge potentials
that produce (51) as stationary wave function for (49)
and (50). From (41), (42) and (51) we then have

FIG. 1: The dimensionless potentials v(s) (thin line), v0(s) =

spectively equations (52), (53) and (54) for ξ = 20 (see refer-
ence [1] for this value). When the external potential is ve(s)
the self–consistent wave function coincides with that of a sim-
ple harmonic oscillator for zero perveance (51).

of the S–ℓ equation for a given zero perveance poten-
tial, the simplest way it is to calculate the space charge
potential for this frozen distribution through the Poisson
equation, and then compensate the external potential ex-
actly for that. This is what we did in our example where
the gaussian solution is the fundamental state of a har-
monic oscillator: we ﬁnally got a total potential which is
v0(s) = v(s) + ve(s) = s2 (namely that of a simple har-
monic oscillator), and an energy value which coincides
with the ﬁrst eigenvalue. In other words, if you want a
gaussian transverse distribution you should not simply
turn on a bare harmonic potential s2: you should rather
teleologically compensate for the space charge by using
the potential ve(s).

If the halo consists in the fact that large deviations
from the beam axis are possible, a new idea is to suppose
that the the stationary transverse distribution is diﬀerent
from the gaussian distribution (51) introduced in the Sec-
tion IV A. To this end we will introduce in the following
a family of distributions which decay with the distance
from the axis only with a power law.

Let us consider the following family of univariate, two–
parameters probability laws Σ(ν, a2) characterized by the
following pdf’s

which apparently are symmetric functions with the mode

in x = 0 and two ﬂexes in x =

are centered at the median.
In particular a plays just
the role of a scale parameter, while ν rules the power
decay of the tails: for large x the tails go as x−(ν+1) with

see FIG. 2. Remark that when ν grows larger and larger,
the diﬀerence between the two pdf’s becomes smaller and
smaller. It is typical of the laws Σ(ν, a2) that they have
(ﬁnite) momenta of order k only if the condition k < ν
is veriﬁed; hence for ν
2 there is no variance, while for
ν

hand when ν > 2 the variance of Σ(ν, a2) exists and is

In the descrip-

tion of a beam in an accelerator it is realistic to suppose
that the transverse distribution is endowed with a ﬁnite
variance. Hence we will look for distributions (58) with
ν > 2. On the other hand this will correspond to suppose
that in our model the transverse Student laws should not
be radically diﬀerent from a Gaussian:
in fact the halo
is in some sense an eﬀect which is small when compared
with the total beam. From this standpoint the family
of laws Σ(ν, a2) has also the advantage that we can ﬁne
tune the parameters ν, a in order to get the right dis-
tance from the gaussian laws (this would not be possible
if we adopted stable laws; see subsequent Section V C).
With this hypothesis in mind we will limit our present
considerations to the case ν > 2 so that the transverse
marginals of (58) will have a ﬁnite variance σ2. Then
from (56) we choose a2 = (ν

First of all in the FIG. 4 we compare the space charge
potential produced by both a Student and Gauss trans-
verse distribution: remark as for the chosen parameter
values (ν = 22, ξ = 20) the two potentials look particu-
larly similar. In fact, given the asymptotic behavior of
the hypergeometric function in (63) and of the exponen-
tial integral in (52), for s
both potentials behave

∞
ξ log s. On the other hand we immediately see from
as
FIG. 5 that the control potentials for zero perveance v0(s)
behave diﬀerently when we move away from the beam
axis; beyond a distance of about r
2σ the two curves
are diﬀerent: while in the Gaussian case the potential
diverges as s2, in the Student case it goes to the con-
stant value β as quickly as s−2. Of course this diﬀerence
fades away when λ becomes larger and larger; that points
to the fact that the principal diﬀerence between the two
cases can be conﬁned in a region that can be made as far
removed from the beam core as we want by a suitable
choice of ν. Finally in the FIG. 6 we compare the total
external potentials needed to keep the transverse beam
respectively in a Student and in a Gauss distribution. We
then see that for large s (far away from the beam core,
while in the Gauss case the total external potential grows
with s as s2 + ξ log s, in the Student case this potential
only grows as ξ log s. In any case, even if the potential
near the beam axis is harmonic, deviations from this be-
havior in a region removed form the core can produce a
deformation of the distribution from the gaussian to the
Student.

If u(r) is a self–consistent, cylindrically symmetric so-
lution of (36) and (37) the position probability density
ρ(r, ϕ, z) in cylindrical coordinates will have the form

In order to estimate the emittance we need to calculate
mean values of positions x and momenta px along one
transverse direction, but we should remember that in SM
we have neither a distribution in the phase space, nor an
operator formalism. The momentum and its distribu-
tion should then be recovered from the velocity ﬁelds (4)
and (5) where – since we are dealing with stationary
states with v = 0 – only the osmotic part is non zero

In a previous paper [1] we adopted the uncertainty prod-
uct ∆x
∆px as a measure of the r.m.s. emittance. As an
example let us suppose again that our wave function has
the form u0(r) for the harmonic oscillator without space
charge given in (45). We then have

This allows two remarks: ﬁrst, α plays also the role of
a measure of the emittance and hence – as suggested in
a previous paper [19] – its value must be linked to the
number of particles in the beam; second, the position–
momentum correlation coeﬃcient of a Gaussian beam is

trary, this is not a good choice: in fact we have shown,
at least in our simple example, that x and px are far
to be uncorrelated, and that as a consequence of (70)
C2 becomes exactly zero. Apparently it is
not realistic to take this value as a good estimate of the
p
emittance. On the other hand, for the same gaussian
example, the value of the uncertainty product ∆x ∆px
is just α which we assume to be a good candidate for
the value of the emittance. On the other hand it is easy
to calculate the same uncertainty product for a Student

Of course, as it is already clear, this value converges to
the Gaussian case for large ν, while becomes larger and
larger for small ν values when the shape of the distribu-
tion moves away from the Gaussian case.

D. Weighing the tails

We can ﬁnally compare the length of the tails of Gauss
and Student distribution in order do assess the possible
halo formation in the second case. Let us consider the

away from the beam axis, and calculate this quantity in
our two cases. From the Gaussian distribution we have

worthwhile to remember at this point that we got about
the same number of particles gone astray in our self–
consistent numerical solutions for a dimensionless per-
veance of about ξ = 20 in one of our previous paper [1].

V. L´EVY–STUDENT PROCESSES

In our context the Student laws Σ(ν, a2) are important
not only because they promise to better describe the halo
by means of their longer tails with respect to usual Gaus-
sian distributions; in fact they constitute an important
family of L´evy inﬁnitely divisible (i.d.) laws. At present
there is a lot of interest about non–Gaussian L´evy laws
in several ﬁelds of research (see for example [10, 18] and
references quoted therein), but this interest is mostly con-
ﬁned to the stable laws which are in fact an important
sub–family of the i.d. laws. The fundamental character
of the i.d. laws can be better understood from two diﬀer-
ent, but strictly correlated standpoints: on the one hand
the i.d. laws constitute the more general form of possi-
ble limit laws for the generalized Central Limit Theorem;
on the other they constitute the class of all the laws of
the increments for every stationary, stochastically con-
tinuous, independent increments process (L´evy process).
These important results have been achieved by P. L´evy,
A.Ya. Khintchin, A. Kolmogorov and other mathemati-
cians from the mid 30’s to the mid 40’s of the XXth
century, but their relevance for the applications has been
recognized only in more recent years. One of the charac-
teristics of a non–Gaussian L´evy process is to have tra-
jectories with moving discontinuities (think to the trajec-
tories of a typical Poisson process contrasted with those
of a Gaussian Wiener process), and we propose here to
describe the trajectories of the particle beam by means of
a L´evy–Student process whose discontinuities can possi-
bly account for the relatively rare escape of particles from
the beam core. For the sake of simplicity we will limit
ourselves in the following to the case of 1–DIM systems
representing one single transverse coordinate of our par-
ticle beam.

P (c) = e−c2/2,

The relevant concepts involved in this discussion are
better introduced in the framework of the theory of the
addition of independent random variables (r.v.):
in the
following we will describe the law

her characteristic function (ch.f.)

is decomposed
On the other hand we say that a law
Ln when its ch.f. can be written as
in the laws
a product (75) of the ch.f.’s of its components. This
already allows us to introduce two fundamental concepts
with ch.f. ϕ is said
(for more details see [28, 29]): a law
to be i.d. when for every n there is a law
Ln with ch.f.

in the sum of n independent r.v.’s all with the same law
Ln (identically distributed). Remark, however, that in
general the laws
. Let
us remember here that we say that two laws are of the
same type when we get one from the other by means of
a centering and a rescaling; in other words, if ϕ(κ) in a
ch.f., then all the ch.f.’s of the same type have the form
eiaκϕ(bκ) for every a and b > 0. For instance all the
(µ, σ2) belong to the same (Gaussian)
Gaussian laws
type; on the contrary the Poisson laws
(λ) with diﬀerent
values of λ do not belong to the same type. Now, a law
is said to be stable when it is i.d. and the component
L
laws are of the same type as
. More precisely a ch.f.
ϕ(κ) is stable when for every b, b′ > 0 exist a and c such
that

Ln are not of the same type as

N

P

L

L

ϕ(cκ) = e1aκϕ(bκ)ϕ(b′κ) .

As an example: the Gaussian and the Cauchy laws are
stable; the Poisson laws are instead only i.d. The fami-
lies of i.d. and stable laws are completely characterized:
in fact the celebrated L´evy–Khintchin formula gives the
more general form for the ch.f.’s of these two classes;
however, while in the case of the stable laws these ch.f.’s
(albeit not in general the laws themselves) are explicitly
known in terms of elementary functions, for the i.d. laws
the ch.f.’s are given through an integral containing a func-
tion L(x) (L´evy function) associated to every particular
law. But for a few classical cases the L´evy functions of
the i.d. laws are not known.

B. Central Limit Theorem and L´evy processes

∈

Let us consider now the sequence of r.v.’s Xn,k with
N and k = 1, . . . , n with Xn,1, . . . , Xn,n independent
n
for every n. The modern formulation of the Central Limit
Problem asks to ﬁnd the more general laws which are
limits of the laws of the consecutive sums

n

Sn =

Xn,k

(76)

Xk=1
Remark that these sums generalize the usual partial sums
of the classical Central Limit Theorem in that: when we
go from Sn to, say, Sn+1, the ﬁrst n terms do not in gen-
eral remain the same: for example Xn.1 does not coincide
with Xn+1.1. Under very general technical conditions the
Central Limit Theorem now states that the family of all
the limit laws of the consecutive sums (76) coincides with
the family of i.d. laws. The stable laws come into play

13

only when we specialize the form of our consecutive sums:
when we have

Xn,k =

Xk
an −

bn
n

where an and bn are sequences of numbers, and Xk are
independent r.v.’s, the consecutive sums take the form of
the usual normed sums (centered and rescaled sums of
independent r.v.’s)

Sn =

S∗
n
bn −

an ,

S∗

n =

Xk .

(77)

n

Xk=1

Then, if the Xk are also identically distributed, the family
of the limit laws of the normed sums (77) coincides with
the family of the stable laws. The classical (Gaussian)
Central Limit Theorem is an example of convergence to-
ward a stable law; on the other hand the Poisson Theo-
rem (convergence of Binomial laws toward Poisson laws)
is an example of convergence toward an i.d. law. Every
stable law has its own domain of attraction, namely the
set of laws attracted by it in the sense of the convergence
of normed sums (77) of independent r.v.’s all distributed
as the attracted law. It can be proved that all the laws
with ﬁnite variance are in the domain of attraction of the
Gauss law, and that a law can be attracted by a non–
Gaussian stable law only if it has inﬁnite variance.

−

−

The general formulation of the Central Limit Theo-
rem is strictly connected to the deﬁnition of the pro-
cesses with independent increments (decomposable pro-
cesses).
It is apparent in fact that if the increments
∆X(t) = X(t + ∆t)
X(t) for non superposed inter-
vals are independent, the previous forms of the Central
Limit Theorem imply that the laws of the increments
must be i.d. laws. Moreover, since the decomposable
process are also Markov processes, the laws of the in-
crements are also all that is needed to completely deﬁne
If a decomposable processes X(t) is stationary
them.
(namely the law of X(t + s)
X(s) does not depend on
s) and stochastically continuous (namely for every t we
have X(t + ∆t)
0)
we will call it a L´evy process. Remark that a Poisson pro-
cess is a L´evy process since, despite its discontinuities, it
is stochastically continuous. In fact these discontinuities
do not impair the stochastic continuity of the process be-
cause they are moving (as opposed to ﬁxed ) discontinu-
ities. On the other hand it is possible to prove that only
the Gaussian L´evy processes (for example the Wiener, or
the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes) are pathwise contin-
uous, namely: almost every sample path is everywhere
continuous (there are not even moving discontinuities).
Now, if ϕ(κ) is the ch.f. of an i.d. law and T is a suit-
able time constant, it is possible to prove that [ϕ(κ)]∆t/T
is the ch.f. of the increments ∆X(t) of a L´evy process.
Hence, if the process has a pdf, the stationary transition
pdf is

so that, at least in principle, we know all that is needed
to deﬁne the process.

The sample paths of a L´evy process are also well char-
acterized:
it is possible in fact to prove that almost all
trajectories are bounded and are continuous with the ex-
ception of a countable set of moving jumps (ﬁrst kind
discontinuities). Then, let us suppose that Lt(x) is the
L´evy–Khintchin function of the i.d. law of the increment
X(s + t)
if νt(x) is the random number of the
jumps in [s, s + t) of height in absolute value larger than
x > 0, it is possible to prove that

X(s):

so that the L´evy–Khintchin function of an i.d. law plays
also the role of a measure of the frequency and height of
the trajectory jumps.

where Kα(z) is a modiﬁed Bessel function. The typical
form of these ch.f’s (contrasted with the Gauss ch.f.) is
shown in FIG. 7. Remark that, since x is a length, the
ch.f. variable κ has the dimensions of wave number (in-
verse of a length). These laws are i.d. but in general
are not stable, the unique stable laws among them be-
(a) = Σ(1, a2). For ν > 2 the
ing the Cauchy laws
Student distributions belong to the domain of attraction
of the Gauss law since they have a ﬁnite variance. For
2 the variance diverges, but it is possible to prove
ν
– the proof will be given in a subsequent paper – that
this notwithstanding they still belong to the Gaussian
domain also for ν = 2. On the other hand for ν < 2 they

≤

C

14

are attracted by non–Gaussian stable laws characterized
by the same value of the parameter ν.

The fact that the Student laws are i.d. – which in itself
is not at all a trivial result proved in steps only in the
70’s and 80’s [30] – shows two kinds of advantages with
respect to more common stable laws:

•

•

no stable, non–Gaussian law can have a ﬁnite vari-
ance, while all Student laws with ν > 2 do have
a ﬁnite variance; this is important since it is not
realistic to suppose that empirical distributions (in
particular for the particle beams) have inﬁnite vari-
ances, but that notwithstanding we will not be
obliged to resort to handmade modiﬁcation (for in-
stance truncated L´evy distributions) as in the case
of stable distributions [10];

the asymptotic behavior of stable, non–Gaussian
−α−1 with α < 2 [18],
laws is proportional to

while the asymptotic behavior of the Student laws

laws – but not the stable laws – to continuously
go throughout all the gamut of decay speeds to ap-
proximate in a ﬁne tuning the Gaussian behavior
as well as we want.

The principal drawback for not being stable is in the
subsequent deﬁnition of the L´evy–Student process.
In
fact the ch.f. of the process ϕ(κ, t) coincides with (79)
only for t
= T it is no more
the ch.f. of a Σ(ν, a2) law. Hence we explicitly know
the form of the increment law only at the time scale T :
we know the ch.f. – namely everything we theoretically
need – at every time, but we do not have the explicit
inverse Fourier transform, and we also know that the
laws are no more in the family Σ(ν, a2). This problem is
tempered by the remark that the situation is not better
for general stable laws: even in this case, in fact, we do
not know the explicit forms of the increment laws not
even for one time scale (they are known only in a few
precious instances). The unique advantage in the stable
case being the fact that all along the time evolution the
increment laws remain of the same type, which is not the
case for i.d. non stable laws.

D. The L´evy–Student process

A L´evy process deﬁned by the ch.f. (79) will be called
in the following a L´evy–Student process. Taking into ac-
count (78) and (79) we can now state that the transition

In principle (80) should be enough to calculate every-
thing of our process, but in practice this is an integral
that must be treated numerically, but for a few particu-
lar cases that will be discussed in a subsequent paper. On
the other hand even to produce simulation for the tra-
jectories of our process we should have some simple ex-
pression for the transition pdf. At least for this last task,
however, we can exploit the fact that when t
s = T the
expression (80) can be exactly calculated and coincides
with the pdf (55) of a Student Σ(ν, a2) (remark that even
this is not possible for the typical non–Gaussian stable
process). This means that we can produce sample tra-
jectories by taking T as the fundamental step of our nu-
merical simulation. In other words we will simulate the
sample paths of a process whose increments are exactly
Student distributed when observed at the (otherwise ar-
bitrary) time scale T . To give a look to these trajectories
we produced a simpliﬁed model which simulates the so-
lutions of the following two SDE’s

−

dX(t) = v(X(t), t) dt + dW (t)
dY (t) = v(Y (t), t) dt + dS(t)

(81)
(82)

where W (t) is a Wiener process, while S(t) is a L´evy-
Student process. We also ﬁxed the velocity ﬁeld v(x, t)
in a suitable way: it will not depend on time t, and its
value is (for given b > 0 and q > 0)

ulations are shown in FIG. 8. In a simpliﬁed model for
a collimated beam this will then produce a stationary,
Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process for the SDE (81) if the in-
tensity of the Gaussian noise is not too large. The pro-
cess solution of the SDE (82) will instead have diﬀerent
characteristics. Let us suppose to ﬁx the ideas that the
two parameters deﬁning the velocity ﬁeld are b = 0.35
and q = 10. The FIG. 9 displays a typical trajectory
of a 104 steps solution X(t) of (81) when the variance
of the Gaussian distributed increments is σ2 = 0.28. In
our simpliﬁed 1–DIM model of the transverse dynamics
of a particle beam this means that the trajectories al-
ways stay inside the beam core. Let us then take as law
for the increments of (82) a Student distribution Σ(4, 1):
its pdf looks not very diﬀerent from that of the previ-
ous Gaussian distribution, as the FIG. 8 clearly show.
That notwithstanding the process Y (t) diﬀers in several
respects from X(t). Indeed not only the typical trajec-
tory displayed in FIG. 10 shows a wider dispersion of its

values and a few larger spikes. The principal diﬀerence is
rather in the fact that while the trajectories of X(t) show
a remarkable stability in their statistical behavior, the
paths of Y (t) have the propensity to make occasional ex-
cursions far away from the beam core (see FIG. 11), and
seldom they also deﬁnitely drift away from the core (see
FIG. 12). This depends of course on the mentioned prop-
erties of the trajectories of a non–Gaussian L´evy process,
and in particular on the fact that they are only stochas-
tically, and not pathwise continuous, namely that they
contain occasional jumps. The frequency and the size of
these jumps can also be ﬁne tuned by suitably choosing
the values of the parameters of the law Σ(ν, a2) of the
increments. It is this feature of a L´evy–Student process
that suggests to adopt this model to describe the rare
escape of particles away from the beam core.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In the previous sections we have introduced the Stu-
dent laws in our SM model for the particle beam dy-

16

namics ﬁrst of all in order to make use of their features
depending on their enhanced variance. In particular we
have shown that the longer tails with respect to the sim-
ilar Gaussian distributions can help to account for the
ﬁnding of a larger than expected number of particles re-
moved far away from the beam core.

It should be remarked, however, that all along the Sec-
tion IV our processes were Gaussian processes since the
underlying SDE (1) is still powered by a Brownian noise.
This is true even in the Section IV B where we ﬁrst intro-
duced the Student laws (55) as stationary distributions
of the process. It is only in the Section V that we in-
troduced a new kind of SDE with a L´evy–Student noise.
The more relevant feature of these processes is the fact
that their trajectories make jumps:
indeed this can be-
come a model for the halo formation in the beams. From
a physical point of view these jumps can be produced by
occasional hard collisions among the beam particles, the
probability of these collisions growing with the intensity
of the beam. In some sense it is not only the variance
of the transverse distribution of the beam which princi-
pally rules the emergence of a halo:
in the simulations
produced here the variances of the Gaussian and of the
Student processes were roughly the same. Rather it is
the qualitative character of the process which accounts
for the rare escape of the particles from the beam core.
For a process produced by a Gaussian noise (a process
pathwise continuous: almost every trajectory is every-
where continuous) there is no chance to observe trajecto-
ries going out of a well collimated beam. On the contrary,
for a process produced by a L´evy–Student noise (a pro-
cess only stochastically continuous: trajectories can have
jumps) occasionally the jump is large enough to put the
particle out of the stream. Of course the frequency and
the size of these jumps depend on the parameters ν and
a of the process: the jumps tend to be smaller and less
frequent when the Σ(ν, a2) distributions approximate a
Gaussian law. In our opinion it would be very interest-
ing to explore the possibility that the processes underly-
ing the intense beam dynamics be ruled by some sort of
L´evy–Student noise rather than by the usual Gaussian
noise.

These remarks point to several research directions.
First of all it is important to better study the L´evy–
Student process in itself: for example a knowledge of the
L´evy–Khintchin functions of the Student laws would be
relevant to the ﬁne tuning of the frequency and the size
of the trajectory jumps. On the other hand even the dif-
ferential form of its Chapman–Kolmogorov equation [31]
would be instrumental to discuss the time evolution of
the process. Then it must be remarked that at present
we have just deﬁned the L´evy–Student process, but we
added no dynamics: it is as if we have the Wiener pro-
cess, but no Stochastic Mechanics or any other dynamical
model added to this kinematics. In other words we need
to build a new generalized SM for the L´evy–Student pro-
cesses. Finally it would be important at this point to
have empirical or numerical data able to corroborate the

hypothesis that the increments of the transverse variables
of a beam are in fact distributed according to a Student

law, rather than according to the usual Gaussian law.

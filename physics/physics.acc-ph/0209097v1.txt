Abstract

The detailed analysis of angular dependence of the synchrotron radia-
tion (SR) is presented. In particular, we analyze the angular dependence
of the integral SR-intensity and peculiarities of the angular dependence of
the ﬁrst harmonics SR. Studying spectral SR-intensities, we have discov-
ered their unexpected angular behavior, completely diﬀerent from that of
the integral SR-intensity. Namely, for any given synchrotron frequency,
maxima of the spectral SR-intensities recede from the orbit plane with in-
creasing particle energy. Thus, in contrast with the integral SR-intensity,
the spectral ones have the tendency to deconcentrate themselves on the
orbit plane.

1 Introduction

At present the theory of synchrotron radiation (SR) is well developed and its
predictions are in good agreement with experiment [1, 2, 3, 4]. We recall that
the SR is created by charged particles, which are moving with velocities υ along
circles of radius R in an uniform magnetic ﬁeld H,

Here E is the particle energy, e is the charge, and m0 the rest mass. The
radiation frequencies ων = νω0 , ν = 1, 2, ..., are multiples of the synchrotron
frequency ω0 = ceH/ E . The spectral SR-intensity (SR-intencity for a ﬁxed
γ3. Two limiting
radiation frequency) has maximum for harmonics with ν

1, E
ﬁrst harmonic ω1 = ω is eﬀectively emitted. The SR-intensity has a maximum
in the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld. In the relativistic case, the integral SR-
intensity (spectral SR-intensity summed over the spectrum) is concentrated in
1 . Thus, as the electron
the orbit plane within a small angle ∆θ
energy increases, the integral SR-intensity tends to be concentrated in the orbit
plane. Any polarization component of the integral SR-intensity has the same
behavior. These results were ﬁrst derived in the framework of classical theory.
Consideration in the framework of quantum theory does not change essentially
results of the classical analysis, since quantum corrections are small [1, 2, 3, 4].
However, one ought to say that the analysis of angular dependence of the
spectral and the integral SR-intensities was not done before in detail. Recently
this work was done by us, and in the present article we present results of such
an analysis. In Sect. II we analyze in detail angular dependence of the integral
SR-intensity. In Sect. III. we study peculiarities of the angular dependence of
the ﬁrst harmonics SR. Studying spectral SR- intensities (see Sect.IV), we have
discovered their unexpected angular behavior, completely diﬀerent from that of
the integral SR-intensity. Namely, one can see that for any given synchrotron
frequency, maxima of the spectral SR-intensities recede from the orbit plane
with increasing particle energy. There exist limiting angles (at β
1) for the
maxima, which depend on the synchrotron frequency. Thus, in contrast with
the integral SR-intensity, the spectral ones have the tendency to deconcentrate
themselves on the orbit plane. The analysis is done in the framework of classical
theory, but as was already mentioned above, quantum corrections cannot change
the results essentially.

2 Angular dependence of integral SR- intensity

In the SR theory one introduces polarization components Wi , i = 0,
1, 2, 3 of
the integral SR-intensity [1, 2, 3, 4]. Here W±1 are the integral SR-intensities of
the right (+1) and the left (
1) circular polarization components respectively,
whereas W2 and W3 are the so called ”σ” and ”π” linear polarization compo-
nents. The total integral SR-intensity W0 is deﬁned as W0 = W1 + W−1 =
Wσ + Wπ . In the framework of the classical theory of SR one can ﬁnd:

Here θ is the angle between the z-axis and the radiation direction. The sum
over ν is just the sum over the spectrum, such that the expressions inside the

One can ﬁnd that for any ﬁxed β all the functions Fi(β, θ) have an extremum
at θ = 0 . Moreover, the extremal values of these functions do not depend on β,

F−1(β, 0) = 0, 2F0(β, 0) = 2F1(β, 0) = 4F2(β, 0) = 4F3(β, 0) = 1 .

(7)

The point θ = π/2 provides an extremum for the functions Fk , k = 0, 2, 3 only.
Here we have:

F0(β, π/2) = F2(β, π/2) = 2F±(β, π/2) =

Therefore, for F3 the point θ = π/2 is an absolute minimum. For any ﬁxed β
the function F2(β, θ) is a monotonically increasing function of θ on the interval
π/2 . Thus, θ = 0 is an absolute minimum and θ = π/2 is an absolute

in the directions θ = 0, π . b) In the nonrelativistic case (β

is maximal exactly in these directions.

Let us consider Eqs. (3) for the ﬁrst harmonic,

Thus, in this case, the radiation components W0, W2, and W3 peak at θ = 0, π,
whereas Wσ does not depend on θ at all.

Analyzing the expressions (20), one can see that the functions fk(1, β; θ), k =
1). Thus, the corresponding

0, 1, 2, 3, peak at θ = 0 for any β (including β
radiation components Wk are maximal at θ = 0 for any β .

→

Besides, at any ﬁxed θ

= 0, π, the functions fk(1, β; θ) , k =

1, 0, 1, 2, 3,
decrease monotonically with increasing β. Thus, the radiation from the ﬁrst
harmonic has the tendency to line up in the direction θ = 0, π with increas-
ing electron energy (β
1). This behavior of the ﬁrst harmonic radiation is
completely opposite to that of the total SR-intensity in the ultrarelativistic case
(as was already said, see the previous Section, the latter radiation tends to be
concentrated in the orbit plane). All the functions (20) have ﬁnite limits as
β

1. See below the plot of the function (20) at β = 0, 1.

3.2 Higher harmonic radiation

To study the angular dependence of higher harmonic (ν > 1) radiation, we have
to analyze the angular dependence of the functions fk(ν, β; θ) for ν > 1.

First of all, one has to remark that all the functions fk(ν, β; θ), ν > 1,
vanish at θ = 0, π. Thus, they have the mentioned absolute minimum at these
points. By virtue of property (4) the functions fs(ν, β; θ), s = 0, 2, 3, have two

All δk(ν, β), k = 0, 1, 2, 3 are non-decreasing functions of β for any given ν , and

The quantities δν

k are maxima for δk(ν, β) at ﬁxed k, ν .

Thus, for each harmonic (ν > 1) and for each polarization component, the
angular distribution of the SR-intensity has its own maximum. All these maxima
have the tendency to recede away from the orbit plane with increasing particle
energy. Therefore, as in the case ν = 1, the spectral SR-intensities for ν > 1 have
the tendency to deconcentration from the orbit plane with increasing particle
energy.

Below we study the functions δk(ν, β) in detail.

Integrating a spectral SR-intensity of k

polarization component over all the

directions, one can obtain the so called total spectral SR-intensity of k
component. Let us denote via νmax
total spectral SR-intensity of k
ν there exist functions βk(ν) such that

k = ϕk (β) the harmonic that has a maximal
polarization component. Then, for any given

In the article [5] the functions βk(ν) were studied in detail. Results of such an
analysis, being compared with the above consideration, allow us to conclude
that the function δ0(ν, β) is not zero for ν = νmax
= ϕ0 (β) . The function
δ2(ν, β) equals zero for ν = νmax
σ = ϕσ (β) that corresponds to σ–polarization
component of the total spectral SR-intensity.

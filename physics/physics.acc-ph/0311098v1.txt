INTRODUCTION

The Rare Isotope Accelerator (RIA) is being designed
to supply an intense beam of exotic isotopes for nuclear
physics research [1]. Superconducting cavities are to be
used to accelerate the CW beam of heavy ions to 400 MeV
per nucleon, with a beam power of up to 400 kW. Because
of the varying beam velocity, several types of supercon-
ducting structures are needed [2].

Since the RIA driver linac will accelerate heavy ions
over the same velocity range as the Spallation Neutron
Source (SNS) proton linac, the 6-cell axisymmetric 805
MHz cavities and cryostats of SNS can be used for part of
the RIA linac. Prototypes for both SNS cavities (b g = 0.61
and b g = 0.81) have been tested [3]. (Herein, b
is the par-
ticle velocity divided by c and b g is the geometric b
.)

The SNS cavity design is being extended to lower veloc-
ity (b g = 0.47) for RIA [4, 5]. Other single-cell cavities
for b = 0.47 to 0.5 have also been prototyped at various
laboratories [6, 7, 8]; in all cases, gradients and Q’s have
exceeded the design goals. A 5-cell b = 0.5 cavity has also
been prototyped at JAERI [9].

This paper covers the fabrication of three prototype RIA
6-cell b g = 0.47 cavities and the RF tests on the ﬁrst and
second of these cavities.

CAVITY DESIGN
The SNS b g = 0.81 and b g = 0.61 cavities are the basis
for the RIA b g = 0.47 cell shape [4, 5]. The beam tube is
enlarged on one side of the SNS cavities in order to pro-
vide stronger input coupling. Less coupling is needed for
RIA, so no enlargement of the beam tube is needed for the
b g = 0.47 cavity [10]. This simpliﬁes the cavity fabrication
and yields a slight improvement in the RF parameters. Se-
lected cavity parameters are given in Table 1. In Table 1, Ep
and Bp are the peak surface electric and magnetic ﬁeld, re-
spectively, and Ea is the accelerating gradient (transit time
included) for a particle travelling at the design velocity.

An analysis was done of the excitation of higher-order
modes (HOMs) in the cavity by the beam and coupling of
the HOMs to the input coupler and pick-up antenna. This
analysis indicates that HOM couplers are not required for
operation of the b g = 0.47 cavity in RIA, allowing for fur-
ther simpliﬁcation of the system [10].

SINGLE-CELL CAVITY PROTOTYPING
Two single-cell prototypes of the b g = 0.47 cavity were
fabricated and tested. The highest gradient reached in the
ﬁrst round of tests [4] was about 15 MV/m. The Q values
at 15 MV/m were about 1010; the low-ﬁeld Q values were
between 2 · 1010 and 4 · 1010. These measurements were
done at 2 K in a vertical cryostat at Jefferson Lab.

Additional tests were done on the second of the two
single-cell cavities while commissioning the facilities at
NSCL for etching, high-pressure rinsing, clean assembly,
RF testing, and helium processing of superconducting cav-
ities. The highest gradient reached in these tests was about
18 MV/m, albeit with a slightly lower Q; however, the Q
still exceeded 1010 at the design gradient of 8 MV/m [12].

MULTI-CELL CAVITY PROTOTYPING

Cavity Fabrication and Preparation

Sheet Nb 4 mm in thickness with a nominal Residual
Resistivity Ratio (RRR) of 250 was used for the 6-cell cav-
ities. The forming and joining of half-cells were done by
the standard deep drawing and electron beam welding tech-
niques used for SNS cavity fabrication. As with the SNS
cavities, Nb-Ti ﬂanges and Al alloy gaskets were used for
the vacuum seal on the beam tubes.

The ﬁrst 6-cell cavity (Figures 1a and 1b) was a simpli-
ﬁed version without stiffening rings, dishes for attachment
of the helium vessel, or side ports for the RF couplers; these
features were included in the second and third cavities (Fig-
ures 1c and 1d).

The ﬁrst cavity was etched with a Buffered Chemical
Polishing solution to remove about 100 m m from the in-

tuning, D E/E was 7% for the Cu cavity and 12% for the
Nb cavity. The second Nb cavity was tuned with a new
custom-built jig for the b g = 0.47 cavity. This made the
tuning easier; a D E/E of 5% was reached in one iteration
(see Figure 2).

First RF Test on the First Cavity

A vertical RF test was done on the ﬁrst 6-cell cavity in
September 2002. The cryostat was cooled down rapidly
to 4.2 K and then pumped to 2 K. As shown in Figure 3
(squares), the low-ﬁeld Q was about 2 · 1010 and the Q re-
mained above 1010 up to Ea = 11 MV/m approximately.
A gradient of about 16 MV/m was reached. The test was
stopped at that ﬁeld due to the failure of an RF cable. Some
x-rays were observed at high ﬁeld, indicating that the de-
crease in the Q at high ﬁeld was likely due to ﬁeld emission.
Modest RF conditioning was required in order to reach a
gradient of 16 MV/m. A small leak into the cavity vacuum
manifested itself when the cryostat was cooled down; the
pressure in the cavity was about 10−6 torr at 2 K.

Follow-Up RF Tests on the First Cavity

The failed RF cable was replaced, the leak in the cavity
vacuum was ﬁxed, and the cavity was retested 1 week after
the ﬁrst RF test (without exposure of the inside of the cavity
to air). A gradient of about 7 MV/m was reached. It was
thought that helium processing might be beneﬁcial, but the
test had to be stopped early due to scheduled maintenance
of the cavity testing facility.

The next opportunity for an RF test was in January 2003.
In between tests, the cavity was etched again to remove
another 50 m m from the inner surface and the high-pressure
water rinsing was repeated. The ﬁnal ﬁlter on the high-
pressure rinsing system (between the pump and the nozzle)
was temporarily unavailable at the time of this rinse.

The results of the January 2003 test are shown in Fig-
ure 3 (circles). The low-ﬁeld Q was smaller than in the
ﬁrst test, although the difference is within the margin of re-
producibility for the measurement. A gradient of about 11
MV/m was reached. The decrease in Q between 9 and 11
MV/m is likely due to ﬁeld emission; the x-ray signals were

side surface. The cavity was then ﬁred in a vacuum furnace
for 10 hours at 600◦C to inoculate it against the “Q dis-
ease.” The pressure in the furnace was ≤ 10−6 torr during
the heat treatment. Field ﬂatness tuning was done next (see
below). The ﬁnal preparation steps were etching of an ad-
ditional 60 m m from the inner surface and high-pressure
rinsing with ultra-pure water in a clean room to remove
particulates from the inside surface of the cavity.

The second cavity was etched to remove 150 m m and

rinsed with the high-pressure water; it was not ﬁred.

Tuning

Field ﬂatness tuning was done on the ﬁrst two niobium
6-cells; ancillary tuning was also done on a 5-cell copper
model. The goal was a ﬁeld unﬂatness parameter (D E/E)
of 10% or less. The ﬁrst cavity and the copper model were
tuned with a tuning jig designed for the SNS cavities. After

larger than those seen in the ﬁrst RF test. Thus the differ-
ence between the September 2002 and January 2003 tests
could be due to particulate contamination during the high-
pressure rinse without the ﬁnal ﬁlter. Although the ﬁeld
level was not as high as in the ﬁrst test, the design goal of 8
MV/m was nevertheless reached with a Q in excess of 1010.
In the January 2003 tests, measurements of Q as a func-
tion of gradient were done at several different temperatures.
The low-ﬁeld Q at 1.8 K was higher (2 · 1010) than at 2 K,
which indicates that the BCS losses are still contributing
to the surface resistance. However, the maximum gradient
at 1.8 K was only slightly higher than at 2 K. A value of
Q = 2 · 1010 corresponds to a surface resistance of 8 nW

.

RF Tests on the Second Cavity

Vertical RF testing on the second cavity was done in
May 2003. In the ﬁrst RF test, a gradient of 8 MV/m was
reached at 2 K. The Q was a bit low (8 · 109) and some
Q-switching was seen, indicating that more etching was
needed.

In preparation for a second RF test, another 150 m m was
removed from the inner surface, and the high-pressure rinse
was repeated. Results from the second RF test are shown in
Figure 3 (triangles). A gradient of 13 MV/m was reached.
The Q was 1010 at the design gradient of 8 MV/m. The ﬁeld
was limited by the available RF power (the input coupling
was weaker than planned).

MICROPHONICS AND MULTIPACTING
Microphonics are more serious for RIA than for SNS due
to the lower RIA beam current. The lateral brace and stiff-
ening rings of the SNS b g = 0.61 cavity will be used on
the b g = 0.47 cavity to reduce microphonic excitation. The
RIA cavities will be over-coupled in order to ensure that
the gradient can be maintained in the presence of micro-
phonics [10]. Some microphonic measurements were done
on a single-cell cavity [12]. Modelling of the vibrations in
multi-cell cavities is in progress. The predictions will be
compared with measurements on the 6-cell cavity.

The RF tests on single-cell cavities showed that there
are no hard multipacting barriers. A soft barrier was seen
occasionally at very low ﬁeld. Multipacting simulations [5,
13] also indicate that there should be no hard barriers in the
single-cell cavities. Likewise, no multipacting problems
were encountered in the tests on the two 6-cell cavities.

CONCLUSION
RF tests have been done on two single-cell b g = 0.47
cavity prototypes and two 6-cell cavities with encouraging
results: all of the cavities exceeded the desired accelerating
gradient, with a Q ≥ 1010 at the design gradient of 8 MV/m.
The ﬁrst 6-cell and both single-cell cavities exceeded the
design gradient by a factor of 2; the second 6-cell reached
13 MV/m. Two niobium multi-cells and one copper multi-
cell have been tuned for ﬁeld ﬂatness. The next step will be
a horizontal test of 2 fully-equipped b g = 0.47 cavities in a
prototype cryomodule [14].

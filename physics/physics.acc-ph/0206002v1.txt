Abstract

Beginning with the general Bjorken-Mtingwa solution, we derive a simpliﬁed model of intrabeam scattering (IBS),
one valid for high energy beams in normal storage rings; our result is similar, though more accurate than a model due to
Raubenheimer. In addition, we show that a modiﬁed version of Piwinski’s IBS formulation (where η2
x,y/βx,y has been
replaced by

Hx,y) at high energies asymptotically approaches the same result.

INTRODUCTION

Intrabeam scattering (IBS), an effect that tends to in-
crease the beam emittance, is important in hadronic[1] and
heavy ion[2] circular machines, as well as in low emittance
electron storage rings[3]. In the former type of machines
it results in emittances that continually increase with time;
in the latter type, in steady-state emittances that are larger
than those given by quantum excitation/synchrotron radia-
tion alone.

The theory of intrabeam scattering for accelerators was
ﬁrst developed by Piwinski[4], a result that was extended
by Martini[5], to give a formulation that we call here the
standard Piwinski (P) method[6];
this was followed by
the equally detailed Bjorken and Mtingwa (B-M) result[7].
Both approaches solve the local, two-particle Coulomb
scattering problem for (six-dimensional) Gaussian, uncou-
pled beams, but the two results appear to be different; of the
two, the B-M result is thought to be the more general[8].

For both the P and the B-M methods solving for the
IBS growth rates is time consuming, involving, at each
time (or iteration) step, a numerical integration at every
lattice element. Therefore, simpler, more approximate
formulations of IBS have been developed over the years:
there are approximate solutions of Parzen[9], Le Duff[10],
Raubenheimer[11], and Wei[12]. In the present report we
derive—starting with the general B-M formalism—another
approximation, one valid for high energy beams and more
accurate than Raubenheimer’s approximation. We, in addi-
tion, demonstrate that under these same conditions a mod-
iﬁed version of Piwinski’s IBS formulation asymptotically
becomes equal to this result.

Let us limit consideration to high energies, speciﬁcally
let us assume a,b
1 (if the beam is cooler longitudinally
than transversely, then this is satisﬁed). We note that all
3 rings in Table 1, on average, satisfy this condition rea-
sonably well. Assuming this condition, the 2nd term in
the braces of Eq. 2 is small compared to the ﬁrst term, and
we drop it. Our second assumption is to drop off-diagonal
terms (let ζ = 0), and then all matrices will be diagonal.

Simplifying the remaining integral by applying the high

will be required[6]. Note also that these equations assume
that the zero-current vertical emittance is due mainly to ver-
tical dispersion caused by orbit errors; if it is due mainly to
(weak) x-y coupling we let
Hy = 0, drop the 1/Ty equa-
tion, and let ǫy = κǫx, with κ the coupling factor[3].
What sort of error does our model produce? Consider a

but with η2/β replaced by
σH , respectively).

that for the proper choice of the Piwinski parameter d, the

We see that the the approximate equation for 1/Tp for high

that for non-zero vertical dispersion the second term in the

will tend to dominate over the ﬁrst term, and the results
become the same as for the B-M method.

In summary, we have shown that for high energy beams

parameter d in P is chosen to give the same equivalent
Coulomb log as in B-M, then the modiﬁed Piwinski solu-
tion agrees with the Bjorken-Mtingwa solution.

4 NUMERICAL COMPARISON[3]

We consider a numerical comparison between results of
the general B-M method, the modiﬁed Piwinski method,
and Eqs. 11,14. The example is the ATF ring with no cou-
pling; to generate vertical errors, magnets were randomly
offset by 15 µm, and the closed orbit was found. For this
example
= 17 µm, yielding a zero-current emittance
ratio of 0.7%; the beam current is 3.1 mA. The steady-state
growth rates according to the 3 methods are given in Ta-
ble 2. We note that the Piwinski results are 4.5% low, and
the results of Eqs. 11,14, agree very well with those of B-
M. Additionally, note that, not only the (averaged) growth
rates, but even the local growth rates around the ring agree
well for the three cases. Finally, note that for coupling
dominated NLC, ALS examples (κ = 0.5%, see Table 1)

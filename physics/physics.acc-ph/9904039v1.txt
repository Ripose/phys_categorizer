NONLINEAR ACCELERATOR PROBLEMS VIA WAVELETS:
1. ORBITAL MOTION IN STORAGE RINGS

Antonina N. Fedorova, Michael G. Zeitlin, IPME, RAS, St. Petersburg, Russia ∗ †

Abstract

In this series of eight papers we present the applications
of methods from wavelet analysis to polynomial approxi-
mations for a number of accelerator physics problems. In
this part, according to variational approach we obtain a rep-
resentation for orbital particle motion in storage rings as a
multiresolution (multiscales) expansion in the base of well-
localized in phase space wavelet basis. By means of this
”wavelet microscope” technique we can take into account
contribution from each scale of resolution.

2 ORBITAL MOTION IN STORAGE

RINGS

We consider as the main example the particle motion in
storage rings in standard approach, which is based on con-
sideration in [9]. Starting from Hamiltonian, which de-
scribed classical dynamics in storage rings H(~r, ~P , t) =
0c2}1/2+eφ and using Serret–Frenet parametriza-
c{π2+m2
tion, we have after standard manipulations with truncation
of power series expansion of square root the following ap-
proximated (up to octupoles) Hamiltonian for orbital mo-
tion in machine coordinates:

INTRODUCTION

This is the ﬁrst part of our eight presentations in which
we consider applications of methods from wavelet anal-
ysis to nonlinear accelerator physics problems. This is a
continuation of our results from [1]-[8], which is based on
our approach to investigation of nonlinear problems – gen-
eral, with additional structures (Hamiltonian, symplectic or
quasicomplex), chaotic, quasiclassical, quantum, which are
considered in the framework of local (nonlinear) Fourier
analysis, or wavelet analysis. Wavelet analysis is a rela-
tively novel set of mathematical methods, which gives us a
possibility to work with well-localized bases in functional
spaces and with the general type of operators (differential,
integral, pseudodifferential) in such bases. In the parts 1-
8 we consider applications of wavelet technique to non-
linear dynamical problems with polynomial type of non-
linearities.
In this part we consider this very useful ap-
proximation in the case of orbital motion in storage rings.
Approximation up to octupole terms is only a particular
case of our general construction for n-poles. Our solutions
are parametrized by solutions of a number of reduced al-
gebraical problems one from which is nonlinear with the
same degree of nonlinearity and the rest are the linear prob-
lems which correspond to particular method of calculation
of scalar products of functions from wavelet bases and their
derivatives.

Then we use series expansion of function f (pσ) from [9]:

of equations corresponding to (1). In the following we take
into account only an arbitrary polynomial (in terms of dy-
namical variables) expressions and neglecting all nonpoly-
nomial types of expressions, i.e. we consider such approxi-
mations of RHS, which are not more than polynomial func-
tions in dynamical variables and arbitrary functions of in-
dependent variable s (”time” in our case, if we consider our
system of equations as dynamical problem).

3 POLYNOMIAL DYNAMICS

The ﬁrst main part of our consideration is some variational
approach to this problem, which reduces initial problem to
the problem of solution of functional equations at the ﬁrst
stage and some algebraical problems at the second stage.
We have the solution in a compactly supported wavelet ba-
sis. Multiresolution expansion is the second main part of
our construction. The solution is parameterized by solu-
tions of two reduced algebraical problems, one is nonlinear

where coefﬁcients λk
i are roots of the corresponding re-
duced algebraical problem (6). Consequently, we have a
parametrization of solution of initial problem by solution
of reduced algebraical problem (6). The ﬁrst main problem
is a problem of computations of coefﬁcients of reduced al-
gebraical system. As we will see, these problems may be
explicitly solved in wavelet approach. The obtained so-
lutions are given in the form (8), where Xk(t) are basis
functions and λi
k are roots of reduced system of equations.
In our case Xk(t) are obtained via multiresolution expan-
sions and represented by compactly supported wavelets and
λi
k are the roots of corresponding general polynomial sys-
tem (6) with coefﬁcients, which are given by CC construc-
tion. According to the variational method to give the reduc-
tion from differential to algebraical system of equations we
need compute the objects γj
a and µji, which are constructed
from objects:

σi ≡

Xi(τ )dτ,

νij ≡

Xi(τ )Xj (τ )dτ,

µji ≡

X ′

i(τ )Xj (τ )dτ,

βklj ≡

for the simplest case of Riccati systems (sextupole approx-
imation), where degree of nonlinearity equals to two. For
the general case of arbitrary n we have analogous to (9) it-
erated integrals with the degree of monomials in integrand
which is one more bigger than degree of initial system.

3.2 Wavelet Computations

Now we give construction for computations of objects (9)
in the wavelet case. We present some details of wavelet
machinery in part 2. We use compactly supported wavelet
basis (Fig. 1, for example): orthonormal basis for functions
in L2(R).

and the second is some linear problem, which is obtained
from the method of Connection Coefﬁcients (CC).

3.1

Variational Method

Our problems may be formulated as the systems of ordi-
nary differential equations

dxi/dt = fi(xj , t),

(i, j = 1, ..., n)

(2)

with ﬁxed initial conditions xi(0), where fi are not more
than polynomial functions of dynamical variables xj and
have arbitrary dependence of time. Because of time dila-
tion we can consider only next time interval: 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.
Let us consider a set of functions Φi(t) = xidyi/dt + fiyi
and a set of functionals

Fi(x) =

Φi(t)dt − xiyi |1
0,

Z
0

where yi(t)(yi(0) = 0) are dual variables. It is obvious
that the initial system and the system

Fi(x) = 0

are equivalent. In the following parts we consider an ap-
proach, which is based on taking into account underlying
symplectic structure and on more useful and ﬂexible ana-
lytical approach, related to bilinear structure of initial func-
tional. Now we consider formal expansions for xi, yi:

xi(t) = xi(0) +

λk
i ϕk(t)

yj(t) =

ηr
j ϕr(t),

(5)

Xk

Xr

where because of initial conditions we need only ϕk(0) =
0. Then we have the following reduced algebraical system
of equations on the set of unknown coefﬁcients λk
i of ex-
pansions (5):

µkrλk

i − γr

i (λj ) = 0

Xk

Its coefﬁcients are

µkr =

ϕ′
k(t)ϕr(t)dt,

γr
i =

fi(xj, t)ϕr(t)dt.

Now, when we solve system (6) and determine unknown
coefﬁcients from formal expansion (5) we therefore obtain
the solution of our initial problem. It should be noted if we
consider only truncated expansion (5) with N terms then we
have from (6) the system of N ×n algebraical equations and
the degree of this algebraical system coincides with degree
of initial differential system. So, we have the solution of
the initial nonlinear (polynomial) problem in the form

If in formulae (10) cjk = 0 for j ≥ J, then f (x) has an
alternative expansion in terms of dilated scaling functions
ℓ∈Z cJℓϕJℓ(x). This is a ﬁnite wavelet ex-
only f (x) =
pansion, it can be written solely in terms of translated scal-
ing functions. Also we have the shortest possible support:
scaling function DN (where N is even integer) will have
support [0, N − 1] and N/2 vanishing moments. There
exists λ > 0 such that DN has λN continuous deriva-
tives; for small N, λ ≥ 0.55. To solve our second asso-
ciated linear problem we need to evaluate derivatives of
ℓ = dnϕℓ(x)/dxn. We
f (x) in terms of ϕ(x). Let be ϕn
consider computation of the wavelet - Galerkin integrals.
Let f d(x) be d-derivative of function f (x), then we have
f d(x) =
ℓ (x) can be expanded
in terms of ϕ(x)

ℓ (x), and values ϕd

and after that we obtain the coefﬁcients of wavelet expan-
sion (8). As a result we obtained the explicit time solution
of our problem in the base of compactly supported wavelets
with the best possible localization in the phase space, which
allows us to control contribution from each scale of under-
lying multiresolution expansions.

In the following parts we consider extension of this ap-
proach to the case of (periodic) boundary conditions, the
case of presence of arbitrary variable coefﬁcients and more
ﬂexible biorthogonal wavelet approach.

We are very grateful to M. Cornacchia (SLAC), W. Her-
rmannsfeldt (SLAC), Mrs. J. Kono (LBL) and M. Laraneta
(UCLA) for their permanent encouragement.

According to CC method [10] we use the next construc-

By moment equations we have created a system of M +d+
1 equations in M unknowns. It has rank M and we can ob-
tain unique solution by combination of LU decomposition
and QR algorithm. The second reduced algebraical sys-
tem gives us the 2-term connection coefﬁcients. For non-
quadratic case we have analogously additional linear prob-
lems for objects (12). Solving these linear problems we
obtain the coefﬁcients of nonlinear algebraical system (6)

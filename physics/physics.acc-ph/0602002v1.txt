The radiation of relativistic charged particles for the quasiperiodic motion in a transparent
medium is considered. For motion of the general kind the diﬀerential probability of the process
is obtained. For planar motion the spectral intensity of radiation is found. The diﬀerent cases of
radiation in the medium-ﬁlled undulators are studied.
In particular, the inﬂuence of Cherenkov
radiation on the undulator one is discussed.

I.

INTRODUCTION

At the present time such power sources of x-rays as undulators [1] are widely used in various ﬁelds of science. In
a number of papers [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], with the aim of increasing of the energy of emitted photons, the crystal
undulator was considered. The recent paper[10] contains a rather complete list of references related to various problem
of crystal undulators [11].

One of the proposed constructions [13, 14] was created and tested in a positron beam. Preliminary results of the
experiment [15] give an indication on the observation of undulator radiation. Calculations of the expected intensity
for this experiment were based on the theory [16] of radiation for quasiperiodic motion in vacuum. This theory
allows one to perform the calculation of radiation spectra for motion of the general type and diﬀerent parameters of
the undulator. In calculations with our experimental conditions we use the theory [16] in the frame of the classical
electrodynamics.

However, in the recent papers [17, 18] the possibility of an appreciable inﬂuence of the medium polarization on
[17] the process was considered only in the dipole
the spectral intensity in crystal undulators was shown. In Ref.
approximation. In Ref. [18] this process was studied for a speciﬁc construction of the undulator and hence for speciﬁc
trajectories of particles. In both cases the radiation of the ﬁrst harmonic was considered.

In this paper we want to extend the theory [16] to the case of a transparent medium. We will study the pointed
process in the general case of dielectric function ε(ω) (where ω is the frequency or energy of the emitted photon),
which may be larger or smaller than 1. The arising phenomena in diﬀerent cases will be shortly discussed. In this
paper we employ units such that ¯h = c = 1.

Note that a large number of problems of radiation for charged particles moving in various media were considered in
Ref.[19]. Here the investigations of the radiation in medium-ﬁlled undulators are also presented. However, these results
concern mainly the total radiation intensity. We also point out the paper [20] where the radiation for quasiperiodic
motion was studied in a wide range of undulator parameters.

II. RADIATION ENERGY LOSSES OF PARTICLE

The well-known formula [21, 22] for the radiation energy losses of a moving particle takes into account the dielectric
function of the medium. The analogous formula in [16] diﬀers from the above pointed one and was obtained for the
vacuum. With the aim of extending of the theory [16] (in the frame of the classical electrodynamics) to the case of a
transparent medium we should ﬁnd its corresponding representation.

The Fourier transform of the vector potential for the electromagnetic ﬁeld of a charged particle moving in the

isotropic transparent medium has the following form [22]:

A(ω, r) = e

where k = √εωn, ε(ω) is the dielectric function (ε is a real positive value), n is the unit vector in the direction of
the photon motion, v, r0 are the particle velocity and its radius-vector, r is the distance from the point, where the
particle (with the charge e) is located in the moment of time t. This relation is valid for large r.

Using this equation we ﬁnd (analogously to [16]) the magnetic and electric (E) ﬁelds. The radiated energy d

This equation describes the diﬀerential radiation energy losses of the relativistic particle moving in a transparent
medium. At √ε = 1 Eq.(3) is the same as in [16].

The relation obtained here contains the peculiarities of radiation processes in a medium. Let us calculate for
demonstration the radiation of the relativistic charge particle moving in the transparent medium with a constant

INTENSITY OF RADIATION FOR QUASIPERIODIC MOTION

Let us suggest that the particle performs a quasiperiodic motion with the period equal to T .
The periodicity of motion allows us to transform the integral in Eq.(3) into a Fourier series. In accordance with

Eqs.(12)-(15) describe the spectral-angular distribution of the relativistic particle radiation for the quasiperiodic
motion in the transparent and isotropic medium. The trajectory of the particle are represented in these equations
in a general form. Eqs.(12)-(15) allow us to calculate the spectral (integrated over angular variables) intensity, with
the help of numerical methods, for any particle motion. However, for some general enough cases the integrals in
Eqs.(13)-(15) may be taken over angular variables so as, for example, in the important case of the planar motion. For

The Eqs.(21)-(24) obtained here are suﬃcient for the calculation of the spectral intensity of the relativistic particle
for its planar quasiperiodic motion of the general kind in transparent media. In these equations the knowledge of
the function ε is required for every computed photon energy. In particular, the process of calculation (at ﬁxed ω)
consists in testing the relation ϑ(θ2) for every n (in the interval
). For such a testing Eq.(18) should be used.
However, it is easy to see that at the condition 2χγ2/√ε < 1 + ρ/2 only positive numbers n are possible.

IV. EXAMPLES OF CALCULATIONS

In this section we point out the basic peculiarities of the radiation for quasiperiodic particle motion in the medium.
For the detail description of this process the knowledge of explicit form of the dielectric function is important. The
aim of our consideration is the application of the equations obtained in the previous section to the calculations of
radiation processes in a transparent medium. Note that many peculiarities of similar processes were discussed in
earlier papers [17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 31, 32, 33]

In the general case the relations obtained here for radiation in a medium are valid, at the condition of a small
inﬂuence of this media on the quasiperiodic particle motion. The diﬀerent processes (multiple scattering, ionization
energy losses and others) can modify the motion of particles and they should be investigated separately. Various
examples of consideration of this problem can be found in the literature [16, 22, 24]. One can assert that, in the case
of small enough values of

case such a possibility should be studied. Thus, we think that in most, if not all, of the practically important cases

In the general case the numbers of harmonic n, which may be radiated, lie in the range (

n
from Eqs.(32) and (33) that the condition 2χγ2/√ε = 1 + ρ/2 is practically equal to the threshold of the Cherenkov
radiation. From Eq.(33) it follows that, at the decreasing of the amplitude of the transversal motion (ρ
0), this
equation describes the intensity of the Cherenkov radiation. Besides, dI(n = 0)/dω = 0 at 2χγ2/√ε = 1. For a
demonstration of this fact, the term 1/(4γ2) was kept in Eq.(12). At ρ

This result shows that the angle of Cherenkov radiation also depends on the ρ-value. From Eq.(17) we see that no

These results are in agreement with those in [17, 18]( for the 1st harmonic) and [32].

It is well known that in usual media the dielectric function is smaller than 1 at high enough photon energies. Thus,
the Cherenkov undulator radiation is possible mainly at the photon energies <
10 eV. Besides, there exists the
possibility to observe this radiation on the photoeﬀect absorption edges [25, 26]. In this case the energy of emitted
photons has a value <

1 KeV.

∼

In accordance with quantum electrodynamics [27] the electromagnetic vacuum represents the medium in which the
dielectric function may be larger than 1. However, for electric ﬁelds which may be obtained in laboratories (< 106
1 is very small and the particles with Lorentz factors larger than 1010 can feel this value. In paper

[28] the Cherenkov radiation was predicted in silicon single crystals (i.e. the analogue of the quantum undulator) for
particles with γ > 108. However, our considerations allow us to predict the speciﬁc radiation of negative harmonics
in single crystals. A similar eﬀect is also applied to the propagation of high energy charged particles in power laser
waves [29, 30].

−

Below we present some examples of calculations of the radiation of relativistic particles for quasiperiodic motion in
the medium. These calculations were done with the use of Eq.(21) assuming that the particle motion in the transversal
plane is harmonic: v⊥ = aω0 cos ω0t.

Figs.1 and 2 illustrate the inﬂuence of media on the radiation in the crystal undulator [13, 14, 15]. In the silicon
single crystal at photon energies larger than 10 KeV the dielectric function is smaller than 1. The disappearance of
the ﬁrst harmonic in such media is shown in Fig.1. Fig.2 illustrates the medium inﬂuence in the case when the ﬁrst
harmonic is partially radiated. Notice that these ﬁgures were made only for aim of illustration and do not take into
account many peculiarities of the real process (such as the inﬂuence of the channeling motion, etc.).

Let us consider the particle radiation in the undulator with the dielectric function larger than 1. In practice it may
be a gas-ﬁlled undulator. Let the energy of particles moving in the undulator satisfy the condition for Cherenkov
radiation (see Eq.(26)). Then the connection between the angle of radiation of the n-th harmonic and the angle of
the Cherenkov radiation follows from Eq.(18)

From here, we get that the condition of radiation of the n-th harmonic is

Let us imagine a medium with constant dielectric function (ε > 1) for all photon energies. From our consideration
(see Eqs.(25),(26),(31),(32) and the condition for the Cherenkov radiation to take place) it follows that in this medium
the positive harmonic is radiated at all photon energies. There is a threshold for negative harmonics in this medium.
In this case the radiation of these harmonics takes place at all above-threshold energies, and with the increasing of
photon energy the number of radiated harmonics also grows. In particular, the frequency ω0 determines only the
threshold energy of radiated harmonics. This consideration shows that the character of radiation (at the pointed
conditions) is appreciably diﬀerent than in the usual undulator.

For illustration of this case we carry out the calculation of the propagation of the beam with the Lorentz factor
equal to 400 in the gas-ﬁlled undulator with a period equal to 10 cm. We also assume the value χ = 10−4 at photon
energies lower than 1 eV, and χ = 0 at energies higher than 1 eV. This value is several times smaller than in many
gases at the atmospheric pressure. The energy range of photons corresponds approximately to visible light. Fig.3
illustrates the spectral intensity of the radiation at ρ = 0.39. In this case harmonics with the numbers -1, 0, 1 are
predominantly radiated. We see that at small energies the radiation of the zeroth harmonic dominates (in accordance
with Eq.(24)). The total intensity grows proportionally to the photon energy and hence is equal to the intensity of
Cherenkov radiation in any medium, which is characterized by the corresponding ε-value.

Fig.4 illustrates the behavior of the intensity of radiation, depending on the ρ-parameter. One can see that at ρ

the intensities of all the negative and zeroth harmonics disappear. The structure in curves at large enough ρ reﬂects

ﬁxed Lorentz factor one has a threshold value ρth = 4χγ2/√ε

the intensity of radiation at the ﬁxed photon energy and ρ-parameter. From our consideration it follows, ﬁrstly, that
the undulator distributes the Cherenkov radiation over its harmonics, and secondly, that the intensity of radiation in
such a medium is much higher than in the vacuum.

Our results about radiation in media with ε < 1 are in agreement with the main conclusions of the papers [17, 18].
[20]. In this paper the radiation process
The Cherenkov radiation for quasiperiodic motion was studied in Ref.
was considered for speciﬁc motion and diﬀerent undulator parameters. However, the particular calculations and
illustrations for the case ε > 1 and ρ > 1 are absent. The Cherenkov radiation was investigated in more detail at
small undulator parameters. The conclusion in this paper, i.e. that the undulator radiation is negligible in comparison
with the Cherenkov one, is in agreement with our results at ρ < 1.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we considered the radiation process in a transparent medium. We obtained (on the basis of such a
relation for vacuum [16]) the general relation for radiation energy losses of the relativistic particle. With the help of
this formula we extended the theory [16] of the radiation for the quasiperiodic motion to the case of a transparent
medium. We got the relations describing the spectral intensity for the case of the planar motion, which may be
prescribed by any analytical equation. The various possibilities of radiation in transparent media were discussed.

Fig.1 Intensity of radiation in a silicon crystal undulator with the period and amplitude equal to 0.05 cm and 100
angstrom, respectively. The energy of the positron beam is 10 GeV. Thin and thick curves correspond to radiation
in vacuum and media, respectively. The parameter ρ has the value ρ = 6.4.

Fig. 2. The same as in Fig.1, but with the amplitude a = 55 angstrom and ρ = 1.83.
Fig.3 Intensity of radiation in gas-ﬁlled undulator as a function of the photon energy. Curves -1, 0, 1 correspond
to radiated harmonics with n = -1, 0, 1. The thick curve is the total intensity. The dotted curve is the intensity in
vacuum enlarged 500 times (with the values of the other parameters remaining unchanged).

Fig.4 Intensity of radiation in gas-ﬁlled undulator as a fuction of ρ-parameter. Curve 0 corresponds to the zeroth
harmonic, curve 1 (-1) corresponds to the sum of intensity of all the positive (negative) harmonics. The thick curve
is the total intensity. The energy of radiated photons is equal to 1 eV.

Fig.5 Radiation of the harmonics in the gas-ﬁlled undulator. The angle θ is along the abscissa axis and the intensity
of radiation of the n-th harmonic is along the ordinate axis. The numbers above intercepts, showing the intensity, are
the numbers of the harmonics. The intensity of the 6th and 7th harmonics are invisible (due to their small values).
The energy of radiated photons is equal to 1 eV. The angle θ for the 0-th harmonic is independent of the photon
energy and for other harmonics these angles are changed in accordance with Eq.(31). The parameter ρ takes the value
ρ = 3.8.

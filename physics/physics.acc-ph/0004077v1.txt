Abstract

We consider the use of a dielectric-loaded structure to extract rf energy from a high
current electron drive beam as a power source for a high energy two-beam accelera-
tor. This represents an alternative technique which we show to have some signiﬁcant
advantages over the use of the currently proposed corrugated metal structures as
power extraction devices. We discuss a particular design that will extract high power
rf (0.1 – 1 GW) from a high current drive beam. Rf generation and transport in this
class of devices have already been demonstrated at lower frequencies. We discuss
the design parameters for 15 and 30 GHz dielectric transfer structures and some
possible experiments.

1 Introduction

One trend in proposed future high energy linear collider designs is the use
of high accelerating gradients in room temperature high frequency structures.
This approach has the advantage that the average rf power for a given accel-
erating gradient scales as 1/(frequency)2 (1), while the breakdown ﬁeld is em-
pirically found to scale approximately as (frequency)1/3 (2). At the same time,

the technology of conventional (klystron) rf sources is diﬃcult to implement at
frequencies higher than X-band (11.4 GHz) (1). Two- beam acceleration (3)
overcomes this diﬃculty by using a conventionally accelerated high current
drive beam as the rf source for the high energy accelerator.

Two beam acceleration requires generation and propagation of a high cur-
rent drive beam, and an eﬃcient transfer structure to extract energy from
the drive beam. We propose that a dielectric loaded waveguide represents an
optimal power extraction/transfer structure. Dielectric structures have been
investigated experimentally at some length (4; 5). We summarize some of the
important features of this class of devices compared to conventional copper rf
structures:

• Simplicity of construction. As shown in ﬁgure 1, the structure is a simple

ceramic tube which is inserted into a conducting copper sleeve.

• Higher order mode damping. Parasitic HEM modes generated by oﬀ-axis
injection errors can be easily suppressed (6) by interrupting the outer con-
ductor with axial cuts and surrounding the sleeve with an absorbing mate-
rial. Note that this technique requires no modiﬁcation to the dielectric tube
and only modest machining of the exterior conducting sleeve.

• Recent advances in dielectric materials for microwave applications. Very low
loss (tan δ ≃ 10−4) and high Q materials are commercially available (7).

Other issues which may represent possible limitations on the performance of
dielectric structures are actively being investigated:

• Eﬃcient rf coupling. The wakeﬁeld generated by the drive beam must be

2

(cid:13)
(cid:13)
coupled out to a rectangular waveguide for transfer to the accelerating struc-
ture. This involves a mode conversion from TM01 in the dielectric tube to
TE in the waveguide. Signiﬁcant progress on eﬃcient coupling design has
been made (8).

• Charging. Beam halo or missteered beam impinging on the dielectric tube
can cause large electrostatic charge buildup, resulting in deﬂection of the
beam or volume breakdown of the structure. We have observed both these
eﬀects in our experiments using polymer based materials such as rexolite or
nylon but have not observed this in any of the glass or ceramic materials
we have tested. Changes in microwave dielectric properties with time due
to radiation damage have also not been seen in our experiments.

• Rf breakdown. The work in this area has been almost entirely conﬁned to
copper structures (2). We have currently generated rf surface ﬁelds in ce-
ramic structures > 10 MV/m at 15 GHz (5) (limited by the available drive
beam properties); no breakdown was observed at this level. We expect that
signiﬁcantly higher ﬁelds can be developed at these frequencies before break-
down occurs but it is worth pointing out that these devices are interesting
as power extraction structures even at 10 MeV/m scale gradients.

2 Rf Power Generation in a Dielectric Structure

We follow the approach and notation of reference (9). Consider a dielectric
structure (ﬁgure 1) with inner radius a and outer radius b. An electron bunch
train passing through the device will generate a steady state RF power

where ls is the length of the structure, qb is the charge/bunch, cTb is the bunch
separation, βg is the group velocity and F (σz) is a form factor proportional to
the bunch spectrum (assumed Gaussian). R′/Q is the normalized ratio of the
shunt impedance of the structure to its quality factor and encapsulates all the
details of the structure geometry.

To compute R′/Q for a dielectric structure, we use

R′/Q =

4Ez0
qbω

(2)

where Ez0 is the longitudinal decelerating wakeﬁeld in the device. In the limit
of an inﬁnitely long structure, the analytic expression for the wakeﬁeld is given

3

in (10). This provides R′/Q via equation 2, and we can proceed to compute
and optimize the properties of our structures.

Since the formalism of reference (10) does not allow for the eﬀects of struc-
ture boundaries, rf coupling etc., it only yields an approximate evaluation of
the properties of these structures. We will also give more accurate results of
numerical calculations which include ﬁnite structure length and rf extraction
eﬀects.

3 Design of the Dielectric Power Extraction/Transfer Structures

In this section we give a reference design for both 15 and 30 GHz structures.
While the choice of device parameters are not identical to the CLIC ﬁnal
design, this work allows the study of the physics and engineering aspects
of dielectric- based power extraction devices. We have attempted to develop
power levels of 100 MW with large coupling to the beam and using a common,
commercially available dielectric.

While 30 GHz is the design frequency of CLIC (9), there are a number of
advantages in developing a 15 GHz structure ﬁrst. The lower frequency is
compatible with both the microwave measurement equipment and the beam
spectrum available at the AWA (5). Also, there is some question whether the
use of 30 GHz rf does in fact provide signiﬁcant performance improvement
over 10 GHz range devices (11).

The choice of dielectric is Cordierite which has a relatively low permittivity
(4.5) and low losses (Q=5000, tan δ = 0.0002). This material is commercially
available (7), and we have veriﬁed its dielectric properties in bench tests.

The choice of dielectric is not unique; for example, steatite, another commer-
cially available material, has a permittivity of 5.8 and loss tangent of 0.0001
and would perform equally well. Theoretically one could also use a low cou-
pling strength R′/Q using a thin layer of high permittivity material to line
the structure (12).

The inner radius a must be chosen to transport all the drive beam. The choice
of dielectric material and the device frequency then ﬁx the outer radius b.
Using the methods outlined previously, we can calculate R′/Q and power
generated in these devices assuming CLIC test facility beam parameters.

Because of the simple geometry, the structures will be easy to machine. Con-
servatively assuming that the outer and inner radii of the structures can be
machined to a tolerance of 25 µm, the worst case deviations from nominal

4

frequency due to this tolerance are 3.4% for the 30 GHz device and 1.5% for
the 15 GHz structure.

4 Numerical Calculations

We also used the ﬁnite diﬀerence time domain program ARRAKIS (13) to
calculate the power generated in these structures while taking into account the
ﬁnite structure length, group velocity of the wakeﬁeld, etc. In order to simulate
the eﬀects of power extraction from the structure, an absorbing boundary was
placed at the downstream end of the dielectric tube in the computational
geometry.

Figures 2a and 3a show the longitudinal wake potentials for the 15 and 30
GHz devices for a single drive bunch and for a train of 1 nC bunches spaced
by 10 cm. Buildup of ﬁelds to equilibrium occurs relatively quickly– after four
bunches (1.33 ns) for the 15 GHz device and three bunches (1.0 ns) for the
30 GHz structure due to its larger group velocity. The apparent “damping”
of the wakeﬁeld after each bunch is in fact due to the large group velocity of
the ﬁelds and the ﬁnite length of the devices. The 15 GHz wake shows some
additional structure due to the excitation of the TM02 mode at 42.8 GHz and
the TM03 at 73.4 GHz. The higher frequency modes result in some ineﬃciency
but in general will not be transported out of the structure when the coupling
is optimized for the fundamental frequency.

The bunch train wakes shown in ﬁgures 2b and 3b reﬂect ﬁnite structure
length and group velocity eﬀects by their not purely sinusoidal character. In
order to compute the useful power generated at the fundamental, we ﬁlter
the data by performing an FFT and zeroing all Fourier components outside a
ﬁxed window in ∆f /f0. The inverse FFT then yields the amplitude W of the
wake within that bandwidth, and the power generated is

P = W (MeV /m/nC) × qb(nC) × I(= qb/Tb)(A) × (ls (m)).

(3)

Table 1 summarizes the parameters of these structures. The power generated
is large, on the order of 100 MW for a 30 cm test structure with ∆f /f0 = 4%
and scaling quadratically with the length of the device. In the 30 GHz case
the dielectric device performance is comparable to the CLIC designs (9) while
being easier to manufacture and to incorporate parasitic mode damping.

5 Summary

We have presented designs for dielectric power extraction structures for two-
beam accelerators which are able to produce power levels competitive with
conventional copper structures while at the same time possessing the advan-
tages of ease of construction and straightforward implementation of parasitic
mode damping. We plan to build and test a 15 GHz device at our laboratory
and if successful build a 30 GHz device for the CLIC test facility.

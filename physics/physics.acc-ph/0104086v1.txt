Abstract

Building on the Radon transform of the Vlasov-Poisson
equations, a macroscopic ﬂuid model for the coherent
beam-beam interaction has been developed.
It is shown
that the Vlasov equation, expressed in action-angle vari-
ables, can be reduced to a closed set of hydrodynamic
(ﬂuid) equations for the beam density and current velocity.
The linearized one-dimensional equations have been anal-
ysed, and explicit expressions for the coherent beam-beam
tuneshifts are presented.

INTRODUCTION

In a colliding-beam storage ring device, the evolution of
each beam is strongly affected by the electromagnetic force
produced by the counter-propagating beam. A basic feature
of this coherent interaction is linear mode coupling, also
known as the coherent beam-beam resonance.

The problem of coherent beam-beam resonances in one
dimension (the vertical direction) was ﬁrst studied by Chao
and Ruth [1] by solving the linearized Vlasov-Poisson
equations. They considered the simplest case of a symmet-
ric collider and obtained explicit expressions for the reso-
nance stopbands. The purpose of the present paper is to
extend their results to the case of an asymmetric circular
collider.

Based on the Radon transform [2, 3], a macroscopic ﬂuid
model of the coherent beam-beam interaction is developed.
The linearized macroscopic ﬂuid equations are then solved,
and a generalized stability criterion for a coherent beam-
beam resonance of arbitrary order is derived.

2 THE RADON TRANSFORM

We begin with the one-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson
equations describing the nonlinear evolution of the beams
in the vertical (y) direction

Here, (k = 1, 2) labels the beam, fk(y, p; θ) is the distri-
bution function, θ is the azimuthal angle, νk is the betatron
tune in vertical direction, R is the mean machine radius, re
is the classical electron radius, N1,2 is the total number of
particles in either beam, Vk(y; θ) is the normalized beam-
beam potential, β∗
ky is the vertical beta-function at the in-
teraction point, and Lkx is the horizontal dimension of the
beam ribbon [1]. The one-dimensional Poisson equation
(2.3) can be readily solved to give

where ̺k is the Radon image of the distribution function

variable, that keeps track of the detailed information about
the action J. It us usually determined by the condition that
the distribution function fk be equal to a speciﬁed distribu-
tion [3], from which J = vk(ϕ, ξ; θ). Taking into account

Eq. (2.10), the beam density can be further eliminated from
Eq. (2.11), which yields the result

It is important to note that Eqs. (2.10) and (2.12) comprise
a closed set, that is (as can be easily checked) equations for
higher moments can be reduced to these two equations.

At this point we make the important conjecture that Eqs.
(2.10) and (2.12) possess a stationary solution that is inde-
pendent of the angle variable ϕ. Without loss of generality
we choose

v(0)
k = ξ = const,

̺(0)
k = G(ξ) = const.

[see Eq. (31) of Ref. 1].

5 CONCLUDING REMARKS

Based on the Radon transform we have developed a
macroscopic ﬂuid model of the coherent beam-beam inter-
action. The linearized hydrodynamic equations are further
solved and a stability criterion for coherent beam-beam res-
onances have been found in closed form.

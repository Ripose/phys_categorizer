Abstract

We derive a simple relation for estimating the relative emittance growth in x and y due to

intrabeam scattering (IBS) in electron storage rings. We show that IBS calculations for the ATF

damping ring, when using the formalism of Bjorken-Mtingwa, a modiﬁed formalism of Piwinski

(where η2/β has been replaced by

), or a simple high-energy approximate formula all give results

H

that agree well. Comparing theory, including the eﬀect of potential well bunch lengthening, with

a complete set of ATF steady-state beam size vs. current measurements we ﬁnd reasonably good

agreement for energy spread and horizontal emittance. The measured vertical emittance, however,

is larger than theory in both oﬀset (zero current emittance) and slope (emittance change with

current). The slope error indicates measurement error and/or additional current-dependent physics

at the ATF; the oﬀset error, that the assumed Coulomb log is correct to within a factor of 1.75.

INTRODUCTION

In future e+e− linear colliders, such as the JLC/NLC[1, 2], damping rings are needed

to generate beams of intense bunches with low emittances. The Accelerator Test Facility

(ATF)[3] at KEK is a prototype of such damping rings. One of its main goals, and one that

has been achieved, was the demonstration of extremely low vertical emittances[4, 5]. At the

low ATF emittances, however, it is found that intrabeam scattering (IBS) is a strong eﬀect,

and one that needs to be understood.

Intrabeam scattering is an eﬀect that depends on the ring lattice—including the errors—

and on all dimensions of the beam, including the energy spread. At the ATF all these

dimensions can be measured; unique to the ATF is that the beam energy spread, an espe-

cially important parameter in IBS theory, can be measured to an accuracy of a few percent.

In April 2000 the single bunch energy spread, bunch length, and horizontal and vertical emit-

tances were all measured as functions of current over a short period of time[6, 7]. The short

period of time was important to ensure that the machine conditions remained unchanged; the

bunch length measurement was important since potential well bunch lengthening is signiﬁ-

cant at the ATF[7]. The question that we attempt to answer here is, Are these measurement

results in accord with IBS theory?

Intrabeam scattering theory was ﬁrst developed for accelerators by Piwinski[8], a result

that was extended by Martini[9], to give a formulation that we call here the standard Piwin-

ski (P) method[10]; this was followed by the equally detailed Bjorken and Mtingwa (B-M)

result[11]. Both approaches solve the local, two-particle Coulomb scattering problem for

(six-dimensional) Gaussian, uncoupled beams, but the two results appear to be diﬀerent;

of the two, the B-M result is thought to be the more general[12]. Other simpler, more

approximate formulations developed over the years are ones due to Parzen[13], Le Duﬀ[14],

Raubenheimer[15], and Wei[16]. Recent reports on IBS theory include one by Kubo and

Oide, who adapt an intermediate result from Bjorken-Mtingwa’s paper to ﬁnd the solution

for cases of arbitrary coupling[17], a method that is now used in the optics computer pro-

gram SAD[18]; and one by Venturini that solves for IBS in the presence of a strong ring

impedance[19].

Intrabeam scattering measurements have been performed primarily on hadronic[20, 21,

22, 23] and heavy ion machines[24, 25], where the eﬀect tends to be more pronounced,

2

though measurement reports on low emittance electron rings can also be found[26, 27].

Typical of such reports, however, is that although good agreement may be found in some

beam dimension(s), the set of measurements and/or agreement is not complete (e.g.

in

Ref. [20] growth rates agree reasonably well in the longitudinal and horizontal directions,

but completely disagree in the vertical). Note that one advantage of studying IBS using

electron machines is that it can be done by measuring steady-state beam sizes.

In this report we brieﬂy describe intrabeam scattering formulations, apply and compare

them for ATF parameters, and ﬁnally compare calculations with the full set of data of April

2000. For more details on the hardware and such measurements at the ATF, the reader is

referred to Ref. [4, 5].

IBS CALCULATIONS

We begin by describing the method of calculating the eﬀect of IBS in a storage ring. Let

us ﬁrst assume that there is no x-y coupling.

Let us consider the IBS growth rates in energy p, in the horizontal x, and in the vertical

y to be deﬁned as

.

Here σp is the rms (relative) energy spread, ǫx the horizontal emittance, and ǫy the vertical

emittance. In general, the growth rates are given in both P and B-M theories in the form:

where subscript i stands for p, x, or y. The functions fi are integrals that depend on

beam parameters, such as energy and phase space density, and lattice properties, including

dispersion; the brackets

mean that the quantity is averaged over the ring. In this report

we will primarily use the fi of the B-M formulation[35].

From the 1/Ti we obtain the steady-state properties for machines with radiation damping:

equations since all 3 IBS rise times depend on ǫx, ǫy, and σp.

The way of solving Eqs. 3 that we employ is to convert them into 3 coupled diﬀerential

equations, such as is done in e.g. Ref. [28], and solve for the asymptotic values. For example,

the equation for ǫy becomes

dǫy

2(ǫy −

ǫy0)

+

(5)

and there are corresponding equations for ǫx and σ2
p.

Before solving these equations one needs to know the source of the vertical emittance

at zero current. We consider 3 possible sources: (i) vertical dispersion due to vertical orbit

errors, (ii) (weak) x-y coupling due to such things as rolled quads, etc, and (iii) a combination

of the two. If the vertical emittance at zero current is due mainly to vertical dispersion,

then[15]

If ǫy0 is

invariant, with η and β, respectively, the lattice dispersion and beta functions.

mainly due to coupling we drop the ǫy diﬀerential equation and simply let ǫy = κǫx, with

κ the coupling factor. In case (iii) we approximate the solution by replacing the parameter

ǫy0 in Eq. 4 by the quantity [κǫx(1

τy/Ty) + ǫy0d], where ǫy0d is the part of ǫy0 due to

−

dispersion only. Note that the practice—sometimes found in the literature—of solving IBS

equations assuming no vertical errors, which tends to result in near 0 or even negative

vertical emittance growth, may describe a state that is unrealistic and unachievable. Note

also that in case (i) once the vertical orbit—and therefore

—is set, ǫy0 is no longer a

hHyi

free parameter.

In addition, note that:

A fourth equation in our system, the relation between bunch length σs and σp, is also

•

implied; generally this is taken to be the nominal (zero current) relation. In the ATF

strong potential well bunch lengthening, though no microwave instability, is found at

the highest single bunch currents[7]. In our comparisons with ATF measurements we

approximate this eﬀect by adding a multiplicative factor fpw(I) [I is current], obtained

from measurements, to the equation relating σs to σp. (Note that potential well bunch

lengthening also changes the longitudinal bunch shape, a less important eﬀect that we

will ignore.)

The B-M results include a so-called Coulomb log factor, ln(bmax/bmin), with bmax,

bmin maximum, minimum impact parameters, quantities which are not well deﬁned.

For round beams it seems that bmax should be taken as the beam size [29]. For bi-

Gaussian beams it is not clear what the right choice is. Normally bmax is taken to be

the vertical beams size, though sometimes the horizontal beam size is chosen[30]. We

take bmax = σy; bmin = r0c2/

= r0βx/(γ2ǫx), with r0 the classical electron radius
10−15 m), vx the transverse velocity in the rest frame, and γ the Lorentz

energy factor. For the ATF, the Coulomb log, (log) = 16.0.

The IBS bunch distributions are not Gaussian, and tail particles can be overemphasized

in these solutions. We are interested in core sizes, which we estimate by eliminating

interactions with collision rates less than the synchrotron radiation damping rate[31].

We can approximate this in the Coulomb log term by letting πb2

equal the

synchrotron damping rate in the rest frame, with n the particle density in the rest

frame[17]; or bmin =

4πσxσyσzγ/[Ncτ ](βx/ǫx)1/4, with N the bunch population. For

the ATF with this cut, (log) = 10.0.

A. High Energy Approximation

For both the P and the B-M methods solving for the IBS growth rates is time consuming,

involving, at each iteration step, a numerical integration at every lattice element. A quicker-

to-calculate, high energy approximation, one valid in normal storage ring lattices, can be

derived from the B-M formalism[32]:

Note that Parzen’s high energy formula is a similar, though more approximate, result

to that given here[13]; and Raubenheimer’s approximation is formulas similar, though less

accurate, than the ﬁrst and identical to the 2nd and 3rd of Eqs. 6[15]. Note that Eqs. 6

assume that ǫy0 is due mainly to vertical dispersion; if it is due mainly to x-y coupling we let
Hy = 0, drop the 1/Ty equation, and simply let ǫy = κǫx. Finally, note that these equations
still need to be iterated, as described before, to ﬁnd the steady-state solutions.

B. Emittance Growth Theorem

Following an argument in Ref. [15] we can obtain a relation between the expected vertical

and horizontal emittance growth due to IBS in the presence of random vertical dispersion:

We begin by noting that the beam momentum in the longitudinal plane is much less than

in the transverse planes. Therefore, IBS will ﬁrst heat the longitudinal plane; this, in turn,

increases the transverse emittances through dispersion (through

, as can be seen in the

H

2nd and 3rd of Eqs. 6), like synchrotron radiation (SR) does. One diﬀerence between IBS

and SR is that IBS increases the emittance everywhere, and SR only in bends. We can write

ǫy −

Jx,y are damping partition numbers, and

C. Numerical Comparison

Let us compare the results of the methods P, B-M, and Eq. 6 when applied to the ATF

beam parameters and lattice, with vertical dispersion and no x-y coupling. We take as

Performing the calculations, but ﬁrst comparing the standard Piwinski and the B-M

methods, we ﬁnd that the growth rates in p and x agree well; the vertical rate, however,

does not. In Fig. 1 we display the local IBS growth rate in y over half the ring (the periodicity

is 2), as obtained by the two methods, and see that the P result, on average, is 25% low.

Studying the two methods we note that a conspicuous diﬀerence between them is their

dependence on dispersion: for P the fi depend on it only through η2/β; for B-M, through
φ = [η′

lattice, at high energies, the results of this method become equal to those of B-M.

Comparing with this method we ﬁnd that, indeed, the three growth rates now agree

reasonably well with the B-M result. Fig. 2 displays the 3 local growth rates as obtained by

the modiﬁed P and B-M methods. The 1/Ti, the average values of these functions, are given

σp/σp0 = 1.52, ǫx/ǫx0 = 1.90, ǫy/ǫy0 = 2.30. Note that for this error seed the emittance

growth ratio of Eq. 11 is rǫ = 1.44, close to the 1.6 expected for the ATF lattice.

Repeating the calculation using Eqs. 6 we ﬁnd that the computing time is greatly reduced,

and the growth rates agree quite well with the B-M results (see Table II). The dots in Fig. 2

give the local rates corresponding to Eqs. 6, and we see that even these agree quite well.

D. Comparison with SAD Results

The optics program SAD basically follows the B-M formalism, but it does it in a form

that treats the three beam directions on equal footing. The ﬁnal results are given in terms of

the normal modes of the system and not the beta and dispersion functions of the uncoupled

system (as in our approximation). For vertical dispersion dominated problems there is no

diﬀerence in result. In coupling dominated problems there will be a diﬀerence that, in the

case of small x-y coupling due to errors, we expect to be small.

We consider the ATF lattice with random magnet oﬀsets and rotations. Other machine

parameters are the same as before; again I = 3.1 mA. For this lattice (ηy)rms = 7.4 mm

and ǫy0/ǫx0 = 1%. For this problem we solve IBS using SAD (for 2 diﬀerent seeds), and

also our approximate method where we include vertical dispersion (as before) and a global

coupling parameter κ = 0.34%. We take (log) = 9.1. Comparing steady-state local growth

rates, we ﬁnd good agreement in p and x for all three calculations. In y, however, there is

a signiﬁcant variation (see Fig. 3). The growth rates, the average values of these functions,

however, agree well (see Table III). Note that the steady-state relative growths in (σp,ǫx,ǫy)

are (1.38,1.56,1.64) for SAD, and (1.38,1.62,1.61) for our approximate calculation.

III. COMPARISON WITH MEASUREMENT

A. Measurements

At the ATF the energy spread and all beam sizes can be measured. Unique at the ATF is

that the energy spread, a particularly important parameter in IBS theory, can be obtained

to a few percent accuracy. In this measurement the beam is extracted and its size measured

on a screen in a highly dispersive region. The bunch length is determined with a streak

camera in the ring. The emittances can be measured using 3 methods: wire monitors in the

extraction line, a laser wire in the ring, and an interferometer in the ring. Unfortunately,

for ǫy all 3 methods have their diﬃculties. For example, the wire measurement is very

sensitive to optics errors (such as roll and dispersion) in the extraction line. Or, the laser

wire measurement, being time consuming (taking

1 hour per measurement), is sensitive

∼

to drifts in machine and beam properties.

Because of the eﬀects of IBS the energy spread measurement (which is quick and easy

to perform) has become a useful technique for monitoring changes in beam size. Thus,

evidence that we are truly seeing IBS at the ATF include: (1) when moving onto the coupling

resonance, the normally large energy spread growth with current becomes negligibly small;

(2) if we decrease the vertical emittance using dispersion correction, the energy spread

increases.

10

B. Comparison with Theory

In Fig. 4, as an example, we present the time development, after injection, of energy

spread for 3 diﬀerent beam currents (the plotting symbols). The measurement was per-

formed by continually injecting beam into the ATF, while varying the extraction timing.

If we take the B-M formalism, with fpw = 1, and with x-y coupling 0.006, and solve the

diﬀerential equations for energy spread and beam sizes, we obtain the curves in the ﬁg-

ure (if we include potential well distortion the ﬁtted coupling becomes 0.0045). The short
time (<
∼

0.05 s) behavior does not agree with the data, since the beam in reality enters

the ring badly mismatched (a region which would be diﬃcult to simulate); in the longer
time range, however, after >
∼

3τp, the agreement becomes quite good. The minimum in the

curves can be explained as follows: Initially the energy spread and beam sizes reduce due to

synchrotron radiation; when the beam volume becomes smaller than a certain amount, the

energy spread begins to increase due to IBS. This result indicates reasonably good agreement

between measurement and theory.

FIG. 4: Measured energy spread as function of time after injection, for 3 diﬀerent currents (the

plotting symbols). The curves give B-M simulations assuming an x-y coupling of 0.006 and no

potential well distortion. This plot is reproduced from Ref. [4].

To compare with theory absolutely, however, we need to measure all beam properties with

the machine in the same condition. Such a complete series of measurements was performed

on stored beam at the ATF over a short period of time in April 2000. The rf voltage was

Vc = 300 kV. The energy spread and bunch length vs. current measurements are shown in

Fig. 5. The curves in the plots are ﬁts that give the expected zero current result. Emittances

were measured on the wire monitors in the extraction line (the symbols in Fig. 6b-c; note

11

that the symbols in Fig. 6a reproduce the ﬁts to the data of Fig. 5). We see large growth also

in the emittances. Unfortunately, we have no error bars for the emittance measurements,

though we expect the random component of errors in y to be 5-10%, and less in x. Note

that ǫy0 appears to be about 1.0-1.2% of ǫx0.

FIG. 5: Measurements of steady-state energy spread (a) and bunch length (b), with Vc = 300 kV.

FIG. 6: ATF measurement data (symbols) and IBS theory ﬁts (the curves). The symbols in (a)

give the smooth curve ﬁts to the measured data of Fig. 5.

Let us compare B-M calculations with the data. Here we take fpw as given by the

measurements, and take as Coulomb log our best estimate, (log) = 10. Note that in the
machine the residual dispersion is typically (ηy)rms ∼
ǫy0, we adjust it until at high current σp agrees with the measurement. In Fig. 6 we give

3 mm. To set our one free parameter,

examples:

1. Vertical dispersion only, with (ηy)rms = 5.6 mm and ǫy0 = 4.0 pm (solid);

2. Coupling dominated with κ = 0.33% (dashes);

12

3. Coupling dominated with κ = 1.2%, with the Coulomb log artiﬁcially increased by a

factor 1.75 (dotdash);

4. Same as Ex. 2 but assuming ǫy measurement error, i.e. adding 0.9% of the measured

(and splined) ǫx to the calculated ǫy (the dots).

We see that σp(I) agrees well with the measurements for all cases, and ǫx(I) agrees reason-

ably well. For Examples 1 and 2, however, ǫy0 is signiﬁcantly lower than the measurements

seem to indicate, and the growth with current is also less. To obtain reasonable agreement

for ǫy0 we need to assume that either IBS is

75% stronger (in growth rates) than theory

predicts, or there is signiﬁcant measurement error, equivalent to

1% x emittance coupling

∼

∼

into the y measurement. Yet even with such assumptions the ǫy(I) dependence does not

agree.

What does the emittance growth theorem of Sec. II B say about these results? It appears

85% by I = 3 mA; ǫy begins at about 1.0-1.2% of ǫx0, and then grows to

that ǫx grows by
about 3% of ǫx0. Therefore, the relative emittance growth ratio is rǫ ∼
than the expected result if we are coupling dominated (1.0); and still signiﬁcantly larger

2.1–2.4, much larger

∼

than the expected result if we are dispersion dominated (1.6), a case that is anyway unlikely
since it requires an implausibly large (ηy)rms ≈
indicates that ǫy(I) as measured is not in agreement with IBS theory.

IV. DISCUSSION

Our disagreement in ǫy between theory and measurement consists of two parts, an oﬀset

part (ǫy0) and a disagreement in slope (dǫy/dI). Together they indicate that we have: error

in theory, additional physics at the ATF, and /or error in measurement.

IBS theory is a mature theory, and the relation between longitudinal and transverse

growth rates (the 2nd and 3rd of Eqs. 6) is simple and intuitively easy to understand. The

main uncertainty in theory may be with the scale factor, particularly in the Coulomb log

factor for beams with elliptical cross-section. Yet a scale factor error can aﬀect only the

oﬀset part of the disagreement. Note also that even if the argument of (log) were in error

by an order of magnitude this part of the disagreement would be changed by only a small

amount (25%).

13

The disagreement in dǫy/dI might be explained by the presence of additional current-

dependent physics at the ATF. We have seen that σp(I) and ǫx(I) can be made to agree

reasonably well between theory and measurement; at the same time, however, the mea-

sured ǫy(I) grows much faster than predicted. One might, therefore, suspect the presence

at the ATF of another current-dependent eﬀect, one that increases the projected vertical

emittance—though not the real emittance. An example of such an eﬀect is a y-z tilt of the

beam induced by closed orbit distortion in the presence of a transverse impedance[15, 33].

More study needs to be done in this direction.

As mentioned before, measuring accurately the small vertical emittances at the ATF is

diﬃcult, and, therefore, emittance measurement error is likely responsible for much of the

disagreement found. We noted that a 1% coupling measurement error in the extraction line

wire measurements can account for the oﬀset part of the disagreement; the slope disagree-

ment, however, is not easy to explain assuming measurement error alone (for an attempt in

this direction, see e.g. Ref. [34]).

Over the time since April 2000 the systematics of the emittance measurements have

improved, especially for the laser wire measurement. Newer results seem to suggest that the

April 2000 measured vertical emittance may have been too large[4, 5]. For the near future

we urge that the eﬀort to obtain reliable emittance measurements at the ATF be continued.

In addition, experiments to study the possible existence of other current-dependent eﬀects

should also be performed. Ultimately, one goal should be to test the accuracy of theoretical

IBS growth rates to the 10–20% level. Note that once we are successful at such benchmarking

experiments, we will be able to use the ATF energy spread measurement as a diagnostic for

the absolute emittances of the beam.

V. CONCLUSION

We began by describing intrabeam scattering calculations for electron storage rings, fo-

cusing on machines with small random magnet oﬀset and roll errors. We derived a simple

relation for estimating the relative emittance growth in x and y due to IBS in such machines.

We have shown that IBS calculations for the ATF damping ring, when using the formalism

of Bjorken-Mtingwa, a modiﬁed formalism of Piwinski (where η2/β has been replaced by

),

H

or a simple high-energy approximate formula all give results that agree well. By comparing

14

with numerical results from SAD we have demonstrated that weak coupling due to random

magnet roll can be approximated by solving the uncoupled problem with the addition of a

global coupling parameter.

Comparing the B-M calculations, and including the eﬀect of potential well bunch length-

ening, with a complete set of ATF steady-state energy spread and beam size vs. current

measurements we have found reasonably good agreement in energy spread and horizontal

emittance. At the same time, however, we ﬁnd that the measured vertical emittance is

larger than theory in both oﬀset (zero current emittance) and slope (emittance change with

current). The slope error indicates measurement error and/or the presence of additional

current-dependent physics at the ATF. The oﬀset error suggests that the assumed Coulomb

log is correct to within a factor of 1.75 (though we believe that it is, in fact, more accurate,

with part of the discrepancy due to measurement error). More study is needed.

[35] We believe that the right hand side of Eq. 4.17 in B-M (with ση equal to our √2σp) should be

divided by √2, in agreement with the recent derivation of Ref. [19]. Also, vertical dispersion,

though not originally in B-M, can be added in the same manner as horizontal dispersion.

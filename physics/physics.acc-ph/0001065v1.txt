Beam Coupling Impedances of Small Discontinuities∗

A general derivation of the beam coupling impedances produced by small discontinuities on the wall of
the vacuum chamber of an accelerator is reviewed. A collection of analytical formulas for the impedances
of small obstacles is presented.

Abstract

1 Introduction

A common tendency in design of modern accelerators is to minimize beam-chamber coupling impedances
to avoid beam instabilities and reduce heating. Even contributions from tiny discontinuities like pumping
holes have to be accounted for because of their large number. Numerical time-domain methods are rather
involved and time-consuming for small obstacles, especially for those protruding inside the beam pipe. This
makes analytical methods for calculating the impedances of small discontinuities very important.

A discontinuity on the wall of a beam pipe — a hole, cavity, post, mask, etc. — is considered to be
small when its typical size is small compared to the size of the chamber cross section and the wavelength.
Analytical calculations of the coupling impedances of small obstacles are based on the Bethe theory of
diﬀraction of electromagnetic waves by a small hole in a metal plane [1]. The method’s basic idea is that the
hole in the frequency range where the wavelength is large compared to the typical hole size, can be replaced
by two induced dipoles, an electric and a magnetic one. The dipole magnitudes are proportional to the beam
ﬁelds at the hole location, with the coeﬃcients called polarizabilities [2]. The ﬁelds diﬀracted by a hole into
the vacuum chamber can be found as those radiated by these eﬀective electric and magnetic dipoles, and
integrating the ﬁelds gives us the coupling impedances. Following this path, the impedances produced by a
small hole on the round pipe were calculated ﬁrst in [3].

Since essentially the same idea works for any small obstacle, the method can be extended for arbitrary
small discontinuities on the pipe with an arbitrary-shaped cross section. Analytical expressions for the
coupling impedances of various small discontinuities on the wall of a cylindrical beam pipe with an arbitrary
single-connected cross section have been obtained in Refs. [3]-[9].

All the dependence on the discontinuity shape enters only through its polarizabilities. Therefore, the
problem of calculating the impedance contribution from a given small discontinuity was reduced to ﬁnding
its electric and magnetic polarizabilities, which can be done by solving proper electro- or magnetostatic
problem. Useful analytical results have been obtained for various axisymmetric obstacles (cavities and
irises) [10], as well as for holes and slots: circular [1] and elliptic [2] hole in a zero-thickness wall, circular [11]
and elliptic [12] hole in a thick wall, various slots (some results are compiled in [13]), and for a ring-shaped
cut [14]. The impedances of various protrusions (post, mask, etc) have been calculated in [15].

This text is organized as follows. In Sections 2 and 3 a general derivation of the coupling impedances
for a small discontinuity is given, and then in Sect. 4 the trapped modes are discussed. This part mostly
follows Ref. [9]. In Sect. 5 we collected for the reader convenience some practical formulas for the coupling

handbook [16].

2 Fields

2.1 Beam Fields

Let us consider an inﬁnite cylindrical pipe with an arbitrary cross section S and perfectly conducting walls.
The z axis is directed along the pipe axis, a hole (or another small discontinuity like a post, cavity or mask)
is located at the point (~b, z = 0), and its typical size h satisﬁes h ≪ b. To evaluate the coupling impedance
one has to calculate the ﬁelds induced in the chamber by a given current. If an ultrarelativistic point charge
q moves parallel to the chamber axis with the transverse oﬀset ~s from the axis, the ﬁelds harmonics ~Eb, ~H b
produced by this charge on the chamber wall without discontinuity would be

Eb

ν(~s, z; ω) = Z0H b

τ (~s, z; ω)

(1)

= −Z0qeikzXn,m

nmenm(~s )∇ν enm(~b ) ,
k−2

where Z0 = 120π Ohms is the impedance of free space, and k2
eigenfunctions (EFs) of the 2D boundary problem in S:

nm, enm(~r) are eigenvalues and orthonormalized

(cid:0)∇2 + k2

nm(cid:1) enm = 0 ;

enm(cid:12)(cid:12)∂S = 0 .

Here ~∇ is the 2D gradient in plane S; k = ω/c; ˆν means an outward normal unit vector, ˆτ is a unit
vector tangent to the boundary ∂S of the chamber cross section S, and {ˆν, ˆτ , ˆz} form a right-handed basis.
The diﬀerential operator ∇ν is the scalar product ∇ν = ˆν · ~∇. The eigenvalues and EFs for circular and
rectangular cross sections are given in the Appendix.

Let us introduce the following notation for the sum in Eq. (1)

eν(~s ) = −Xg

g eg(~s )∇ν eg(~b )
k−2

(3)

(2)

where g = {n, m} is a generalized index. From a physical viewpoint, this is just a normalized electrostatic
ﬁeld produced at the hole location by a ﬁlament charge displaced from the chamber axis by distance ~s. It
satisﬁes the normalization condition

dl eν(~s ) = 1 ,

(4)

I∂S

where integration goes along the boundary ∂S, which is a consequence of the Gauss law. It follows from the
fact that Eq. (3) gives the boundary value of ~eν(~s ) ≡ −~∇Φ(~r − ~s ), where Φ(~r − ~s ) is the Green function
of boundary problem (2): ∇2 Φ(~r − ~s ) = −δ(~r − ~s ). For the symmetric case of an on-axis beam in a
circular pipe of radius b from Eq. (4) immediately follows eν(0) = 1/(2πb). It can also be derived by directly
summing up the series in Eq. (3) for this particular case.

2.2 Eﬀective Dipoles and Polarizabilities
At distances l such that h ≪ l ≪ b, the ﬁelds radiated by the hole into the pipe are equal to those produced
by eﬀective dipoles [1, 2]

Pν = −χε0Eh
Mz = (ψzτ H h

ν /2; Mτ = (ψτ τ H h
τ + ψzzH h

z )/2 ,

τ + ψτ zH h

z )/2;

(5)

2

where superscript ’h’ means that the ﬁelds are taken at the hole. Polarizabilities ψ, χ are related to the
eﬀective ones αe, αm used in [2, 3] as αe = −χ/2 and αm = ψ/2, so that for a circular hole of radius a in a
thin wall ψ = 8a3/3 and χ = 4a3/3 [1]. In general, ψ is a symmetric 2D-tensor, which can be diagonalized.
If the hole is symmetric, and its symmetry axis is parallel to ˆz, the skew terms vanish, i.e. ψτ z = ψzτ = 0.
In a more general case of a non-zero tilt angle α between the major symmetry axis and ˆz,

ψτ τ = ψ⊥ cos2 α + ψk sin2 α ,
ψτ z = ψzτ = (ψk − ψ⊥) sin α cos α ,
ψzz = ψ⊥ sin2 α + ψk cos2 α ,

(6)

where ψk is the longitudinal magnetic susceptibility (for the external magnetic ﬁeld along the major axis),
and ψ⊥ is the transverse one (the ﬁeld is transverse to the major axis of the hole). When the eﬀective
dipoles are obtained, e.g., by substituting beam ﬁelds (1) into Eqs. (5), one can calculate the ﬁelds in the
chamber as a sum of waveguide eigenmodes excited in the chamber by the dipoles, and ﬁnd the impedance.
This approach has been carried out for a circular pipe in [3], and for an arbitrary chamber in [5]. The
polarizabilities for various types of small discontinuities are discussed in detail in Section 5.

2.3 Radiated Fields

The radiated ﬁelds in the chamber can be expanded in a series in TM- and TE-eigenmodes [2] as

or negative (−, z < 0) direction, and θ(z) is the Heaviside step function. The ﬁelds F (E)

3 Impedance

3.1 Longitudinal Impedance

The generalized longitudinal impedance of the hole depends on the transverse oﬀsets from the chamber axis
~s of the leading particle and ~t of the test particle, and is deﬁned [6] as

Z(k; ~s, ~t ) = −

1

q Z ∞

−∞

dze−ikzEz(~t, z; ω) ,

(18)

where the longitudinal ﬁeld Ez(~t, z; ω) is taken along the test particle path. The displacements from the axis
are assumed to be small, s ≪ b and t ≪ b. The impedance Z(k; ~s, ~t ) includes higher multipole longitudinal
impedances, and in the limit s, t → 0 gives the usual monopole one Z(k) = Z(k; 0, 0). To calculate Ez(~t, z; ω),

4

we use Eq. (7) with coeﬃcients (9) and (12) in which the corrected near-hole ﬁelds (14)-(16) are substituted
[a dependence on ~s enters via beam ﬁelds (1)]. It yields

1) (cid:21) ,
where eν(~r ) is deﬁned above by Eq. (3). In practice, we are usually interested only in the monopole term
Z(k) = Z(k; 0, 0), and will mostly use Eq. (19) with replacement eν(~s )eν (~t ) → ˜e2
ν, where ˜eν ≡ eν(0).
In deriving Eq. (19) we have neglected the coupling terms between Eν , Hτ and Hz, cf. Eqs. (14)-(16),
which contribute to the third order of an expansion discussed below, and also have taken into account that
ψτ z = ψzτ .

For a small discontinuity, polarizabilities ψ, χ = O(h3), and they are small compared to b3. If we expand

the impedance (19) in a perturbation series in polarizabilities, the ﬁrst order gives

(20)

that is exactly the inductive impedance obtained in [5] for an arbitrary cross section of the chamber. For a
particular case of a circular pipe, from either direct summation in (1) or applying the Gauss law, one gets
˜eν = 1/(2πb). Substituting that into Eq. (20) leads to a well-known result [3, 4]:

(23)

where the sums include only a ﬁnite number of the eigenmodes propagating in the chamber at a given
frequency, i.e. those with ks < k or k′

s < k.

The dependence of Re Z on frequency is rather complicated; it has sharp peaks near the cutoﬀs of all
propagating eigenmodes of the chamber, and increases in average with the frequency increase. Well above
the chamber cutoﬀ, i.e. when kb ≫ 1 (but still kh ≪ 1 to justify the Bethe approach), this dependence can
be derived as follows. If the waveguide cross section S is a simply connected region, the average number
n(k) of the eigenvalues ks (or k′

s) which are less than k, for kb ≫ 1, is proportional to k2 [17]:

n(k) ≃

s ∝ k′

where S is the area of the cross section. Using this property, and taking into account that ∇ν eh
s ∝ kseh
s ,
and ∇τ hh
dk n(k). It turns out
that all sums in Eq. (23) have the same asymptotic behavior, being linear in k, and as a result, Re Z ∝ k4.
Obtaining the exact coeﬃcient in this dependence seems rather involved for a general S, but it can be easily
done for a rectangular chamber, see in Appendix B. The result is

(24)

Remarkably, the same answer (for ψτ z = 0) has been obtained in Ref. [3] simply by calculating the energy
radiated by the dipoles into a half-space. The physical reason for this coincidence is clear: at frequencies well
above the cutoﬀ the eﬀective dipoles radiate into the waveguide the same energy as into an open half-space.
Strictly speaking, the real part of impedance is non-zero even below the chamber cutoﬀ, due to radiation
outside. In the case of a thin wall, Re Z below the cutoﬀ can be estimated by Eq. (24), and twice that for
high frequencies, kb ≫ 1. For a thick wall, the contribution of the radiation outside to Re Z is still given by
Eq. (24), but with the outside polarizabilities substituted, and it decreases exponentially with the thickness
increase [4].

The real part of the impedance is related to the power P scattered by the hole into the beam pipe as
Re Z = 2P/q2. These energy considerations can be used as an alternative way for the impedance calculation.
The radiated power is

in sth eigenmode:

and

P (H)
s = Z0kβ′

sk′2

s /2 .

Substituting beam ﬁelds (1) into Eqs. (9)-(13) for the coeﬃcients As and Bs and performing calculations
gives us exactly the result (23). Such an alternative derivation of the real part has been carried out in Ref. [8]
for a circular pipe with a symmetric untilted hole (ψτ z = 0). Our result (23) coincides, in this particular
case, with that of Reference [8]. It is appropriate to mention also that in this case at high frequencies the
series has been summed approximately [8] using asymptotic expressions for roots of the Bessel functions,
and the result, of course, agrees with Eq. (24).

One should note that the additional ψ2

τ z-term in Eq. (23) is important in some particular cases. For
example, this skew term gives a leading contribution to Re Z for a long and slightly tilted slot, because ψτ z
can be much larger than ψτ τ in this case, since ψk ≫ ψ⊥, cf. Eqs. (6).

3.2 Transverse Impedance

We will make use of the expression for the generalized longitudinal impedance Z(k; ~s, ~t), Eq. (19). According
to the Panofsky-Wenzel theorem, the transverse impedance can be derived as ~Z⊥(k; ~s, ~t ) = ~∇Z(k; ~s, ~t )/(ks),
see, e.g., [6] for details. This way leads to the expression

is a unit vector in this plane in direction ϕd, which is deﬁned by conditions cos ϕd = dx/q d2

is deﬂected along this direction and vanishes when the beam oﬀset is perpendicular to it.

The equation (26) includes the corrections due to waves radiated by the hole into the chamber in exactly
the same way as Eq. (19) for the longitudinal impedance. If we expand it in a series in the polarizabilities,
the ﬁrst order of the square brackets in (26) gives (ψτ τ − χ), and the resulting inductive impedance is [5]:

For a circular pipe, dx = cos ϕh/(πb2) and dy = sin ϕh/(πb2), where ϕh is the azimuthal position of
the discontinuity (hole). As a result, ϕd = ϕh, and the deﬂecting force is directed toward (or opposite to)
the hole. Note that in axisymmetric structures the beam-deﬂecting force is directed along the beam oﬀset;
the presence of an obstacle obviously breaks this symmetry. For a general cross section, the direction of
the deﬂecting force depends on the hole position in a complicated way, see [5] for rectangular and elliptic
chambers.

The transverse impedance of a discontinuity on the wall of a circular pipe has a simple form [3]:

where ~ah is a unit vector in the direction from the chamber axis to the discontinuity, orthogonal to ˆz.

For M (M ≥ 3) holes uniformly spaced in one cross section of a circular beam pipe, a vector sum of M

expressions (28) gives the transverse impedance as

~Z⊥ circ M (k) = −iZ0

αm + αe

(29)

where ~ab = ~s/|~s| is a unit vector in the direction of the beam transverse oﬀset. One can see that the deﬂecting
force is now directed along the beam oﬀset, i.e. some kind of the axial symmetry restoration occurs. The
maximal value of Z⊥ for M holes which are uniformly spaced in one cross-section is only M/2 times larger
than that for M = 1. Moreover, the well-known empirical relation Z⊥ = (2/b2k)Z, which is justiﬁed only
for axisymmetric structures, holds in this case also.

The second order term in Eq. (26) includes Re Z⊥, cf. Sect. 3.1 for the longitudinal impedance.

4 Trapped Modes

1, Σ2, or Σ′

3 becomes very large, due to very small Γs = (k2

So far we considered the perturbation expansion of Eq. (19) implicitly assuming that correction terms O(ψ)
and O(χ) in the denominators of its right-hand side (RHS) are small compared to 1. Under certain conditions
this assumption is incorrect, and it leads to some non-perturbative results. Indeed, at frequencies slightly
below the chamber cut-oﬀs, 0 < ks − k ≪ ks (or the same with replacement ks → k′
s), a single term in
sums Σ′
s) in its denominator, and
then the “corrections” ψΣ or χΣ can be of the order of 1. As a result, one of the denominators of the RHS
of Eqs. (19) can vanish, which corresponds to a resonance of the coupling impedance. On the other hand,
vanishing denominators in Eqs. (14)-(16) mean the existence of non-perturbative eigenmodes of the chamber
with a hole, since non-trivial solutions E, H 6= 0 exist even for vanishing external (beam) ﬁelds Eb, H b = 0.
These eigenmodes are nothing but the trapped modes studied in [18] for a circular waveguide with a small
discontinuity. In our approach, one can easily derive parameters of trapped modes for waveguides with an
arbitrary cross section.

Γs in its denominator, and one can neglect the other terms. Then the condition for a non-trivial solution

up to some arbitrary amplitude. Strictly speaking, these expressions are valid at distances |z| > b from the
discontinuity. Typically, ψτ τ = O(h3) and ∇ν eh
s = O(1/b), and, as a result, Γsb ≪ 1. It follows that the
ﬁeld of the trapped mode extends along the vacuum chamber over the distance 1/Γs, large compared to the
chamber transverse dimension b.

The existence of the trapped modes in a circular waveguide with a small hole was ﬁrst proved in [18], and
conditions similar to Eq. (31) for this particular case were obtained in [18, 19], using the Lorentz reciprocity
theorem. From the general approach presented here for the waveguide with an arbitrary cross section,
their existence follows in a natural way. Moreover, in such a derivation, the physical mechanism of this
phenomenon becomes quite clear: a tangential magnetic ﬁeld induces a magnetic moment on the hole, and
the induced magnetic moment supports this ﬁeld if the resonance condition (31) is satisﬁed, so that the
mode can exist even without an external source. One should also note that the induced electric moment Pν
is negligible for the trapped TM-mode, since Pν = O(Γsb)Mτ , as follows from Eq. (32).

The equation (31) gives the frequency shift ∆ωs ≡ ωs − Ωs of the trapped sth TM-mode down from the

(33)

In the case of a small hole this frequency shift is very small, and for the trapped mode (32) to exist, the
width of the resonance should be smaller than ∆ωs. Contributions to the resonance width come from energy
dissipation in the waveguide wall due to its ﬁnite conductivity, and from energy radiation inside the waveguide
and outside, through the hole. Radiation escaping through the hole is easy to estimate [18], and for a thick
wall it is exponentially small, e.g., [4]. The damping rate due to a ﬁnite conductivity is γ = P/(2W ), where
P is the time-averaged power dissipation and W is the total ﬁeld energy in the trapped mode, which yields

(34)

where δ is the skin-depth at frequency Ωs, and the integration is along the boundary ∂S. The evaluation
of the radiation into the lower waveguide modes propagating in the chamber at given frequency Ωs is also
straightforward [8], if one makes use of the coeﬃcients of mode excitation by eﬀective dipoles on the hole,
Eqs. (9)-(13). The corresponding damping rate γR = O(ψ3) is small compared to ∆ωs. For instance, if there

(H11 has a lower cutoﬀ than E01),

One can easily see that denominator [1−χ(Σ1−Σ′
1)] in Eq. (14) does not vanish because singular terms in
Σ′
1 have a “wrong” sign. However, due to the coupling between Eν and Hz, a non-trivial solution Eν, Hz 6= 0
of simultaneous equations (14) and (16) can exist, even when Eb = 0. The corresponding condition has the
form

which gives the frequency of the trapped TEnm-mode, provided the RHS of Eq. (36) is positive.

4.2 Impedance
The trapped mode (32) gives a resonance contribution to the longitudinal coupling impedance at ω ≈ Ωs

where the shunt impedance Rs can be calculated as that for a cavity with given eigenmodes, e.g. [6],

The integral in the denominator is taken over the inner wall surface, and we assume here that the power
losses due to its ﬁnite conductivity dominate. Integrating in the numerator one should include all TM-modes
generated by the eﬀective magnetic moment on the hole using Eqs. (9)-(13), in spite of a large amplitude of
only the trapped TMs mode. While all other amplitudes are suppressed by factor Γsb ≪ 1, their contributions
are comparable to that from TMs, because this integration produces the factor Γqb for any TMq mode. The
integral in the denominator is obviously dominated by TMs. Performing calculations yields

Results for a particular shape of the chamber cross section can be obtained from the equations above by

substituting the corresponding eigenfunctions (see Appendix).

One should note that typically the peak value Rs of the impedance resonance due to one small hole is
rather small except for the limit of a perfectly conducting wall, δ → 0 — indeed, Rs ∝ (h/b)9b/δ, and h ≪ b.
However, for many not-so-far separated holes, the resulting impedance can be much larger. The trapped
modes for many discontinuities on a circular waveguide has been studied in Ref. [19], and the results can be
readily transferred to the considered case of an arbitrary shape of the chamber cross section. In particular,
it was demonstrated that the resonance impedance in the extreme case can be as large as N 3 times that for
a single discontinuity, where N is the number of discontinuities. It strongly depends on the distribution of
discontinuities, or on the distance between them if a regular array is considered.

After the trapped modes in beam pipes with small holes were predicted theoretically [18, 19], their

existence was proved by experiments with perforated waveguides at CERN [20].

5 Analytical Formulae for Some Small Discontinuities

For reader convenience, in this section we collected analytical expressions for the coupling impedances of
various small discontinuities. The expressions give the inductive part of the impedance and work well at
frequencies below the chamber cutoﬀ, and, in many cases, even at much higher frequencies. However, there
can also exist resonances of the real part at frequencies near the cutoﬀ for holes and cavities due to the
trapped modes, as was shown in [18, 19], and the real part of the impedance due to the energy radiated into
the beam pipe should be taken into account at frequencies above the cutoﬀ, see [7, 9, 21].

It is worth noting that both the longitudinal and transverse impedance are proportional to the same
combination of polarizabilities, αe + αm, for any cross section of the beam pipe. Here we use the eﬀective
polarizabilities αe, αm as deﬁned in [2]; they are related to the magnetic susceptibility ψ and the electric
polarizability χ of an obstacle as αe = −χ/2 and αm = ψ/2. The real part of the impedance is proportional
to α2
m, and is usually small compared to the reactance at frequencies below the chamber cutoﬀ. While
the impedances below are written for a round pipe, more results for the other chamber cross sections, the
impedance dependence on the obstacle position on the wall and on the beam position can be found in
[5, 7, 9, 21, 22].

e + α2

The longitudinal impedance of a small obstacle on the wall of a cylindrical beam pipe with a circular

transverse cross section of radius R is simply [3] (up to notations, it is the same Eq. (21) above)

Z(k) = −ikZ0

αe + αm
4π2R2

,

(40)

where Z0 = 120π Ohms is the impedance of free space, k = ω/c is the wave number, and αe, αm are the
electric and magnetic polarizabilities of the discontinuity. The polarizabilities depend on the obstacle shape
and size.

The transverse dipole impedance of the discontinuity for this case is

~Z⊥(ω) = −iZ0

αm + αe
π2R4 ~ah cos(ϕh − ϕb) ,

(41)

where ~ah is the unit vector directed to the obstacle in the chamber transverse cross section containing it, ϕh
and ϕb are azimuthal angles of the obstacle and beam in this cross section.

5.1 Holes and Slots
For a circular hole with radius a in a thin wall, when thickness t ≪ a, the polarizabilities are αm =
4a3/3, αe = −2a3/3, so that the impedance Eq. (40) takes a simple form

Z(k) = −ikZ0

a3

6π2R2 ,

(42)

and similarly for Eq. (41). For the hole in a thick wall, t ≥ a, the sum (αm + αe) = 2a3/3 should be
multiplied by a factor 0.56, see [4, 11]. There are also analytical expressions for polarizabilities of elliptic
holes in a thin wall [2], and paper [12] gives thickness corrections for this case. Surprisingly, the thickness
factor for (αm + αe) exhibits only a weak dependence on ellipse eccentricity ε, changing its limiting value
for the thick wall from 0.56 for ε = 0 to 0.59 for ε = 0.99.

For a longitudinal slot of length l and width w, w/l ≤ 1, in a thin wall, useful approximations have been

obtained [13]: for a rectangular slot

αm + αe = w3(0.1814 − 0.0344w/l) ;

and for a rounded end slot

substituting of which into Eqs. (40)-(41) gives the impedances of slots. Figure 1 compares impedances for
diﬀerent shapes of pumping holes.

5.2 Annular Cut

The polarizabilities of a ring-shaped cut in the wall of an arbitrary thickness have been calculated in [14].
Such an aperture can serve as an approximation for a electrode of a button-type beam position monitor, for
a thin wall, or a model of a coax attached to the vacuum chamber, when the wall thickness is large. If a and
b denote the inner and outer radii of the annular cut, a ≤ b ≪ R, the magnetic susceptibility of a narrow
(w = b − a ≪ b) annular slot in a thin plate is

ψ ≃

π2b2a

ln(32b/w) − 2

.

(43)

For a narrow annular gap in the thick wall the asymptotic behavior is ψ ≃ 2πb2w. The approximation (43)
works well for narrow gaps, w/b ≤ 0.15, while the thick wall result is good only for w/b ≤ 0.05.
Analytical results for the electric polarizability of a narrow annular cut are: for a thin wall

χ ≃ π2w2(b + a)/8 ,

(44)

and for a thick wall

(45)
These estimates work amazingly well even for very wide gaps, up to w/b ≥ 0.85. The electric polarizability
depends on the wall thickness rather weakly.
The diﬀerence (ψ − χ)/b3 = 2(αm + αe)/b3 for an annular cut, calculated by variational methods in [14],

χ ≃ w2(b + a) .

is plotted in Fig. 2 for a few values of the wall thickness.

5.3 Protrusions

direction (along the chamber axis), b in the radial direction, and c in the azimuthal one, with a, b, c ≪ R,

impedance of a narrow pin (post) of height h and radius a, protruding radially into the beam pipe:1

The factor F ≡ (αe + αm)/V , where V = 2πa2h/3 is the volume occupied by the obstacle, is plotted in
Fig. 3 versus the ratio h/a. The ﬁgure also shows comparison with the asymptotic approximation given by
Eq. (51).

5.3.2 Mask

One more particular case of interest is h = a, i.e. a semispherical obstacle of radius a. From Eqs. (49)-(50)
the impedance of such a discontinuity is

Z(k) = −ikZ0

a3
4πR2 ,

(52)

which is 3π/2 times that for a circular hole of the same radius in a thin wall, cf. Eq. (42).

Another useful result that can be derived from the general solution, Eqs. (46)-(48), is the impedance
of a mask intended to intercept synchrotron radiation. We put b = c = h, so that our model mask has
the semicircular shape with radius h in its largest transverse cross section. Then the integral in Eq. (48) is
reduced to

and we can further simplify the result for two particular cases.

The ﬁrst one is the thin mask, a ≪ h, in which case αe ≃ 8h3/3 , and again it dominates the magnetic
term, αm ≃ −V = −2πah2/3. The coupling impedance for such an obstacle — a half disk of radius h and
thickness 2a, a ≪ h, transverse to the chamber axis — is therefore

Figure 4: Impedance Z of a mask (in units of that for a semisphere with the same depth, Eq. (52) with
a = h) versus its length. The narrow-mask approximation, Eq. (53), is short dashed, and the long-mask one,
Eq. (54), is long dashed.

In the opposite limit, h ≪ a, which corresponds to a long (along the beam) mask, the leading terms
αe ≃ −αm ≃ 4πah2/3 cancel each other. As a result, the impedance of a long mask with length l = 2a and
height h, h ≪ l, is

Z(k) ≃ −ikZ0

4h4

3πR2l (cid:18)ln

l

h − 1(cid:19) ,

(54)

which is relatively small due to the “aerodynamic” shape of this obstacle, in complete analogy with results
for long elliptic slots [3, 4, 13].

Figure 4 shows the impedance of a mask with a given semicircular transverse cross section of radius h
versus its normalized half length, a/h. The comparison with the asymptotic approximations Eqs. (53) and
(54) is also shown. One can see, that the asymptotic behavior (54) starts to work well only for very long
masks, namely, when l = 2a ≥ 10h. Figure 4 demonstrates that the mask impedance depends rather weakly
on the length. Even a very thin mask (a ≪ h) contributes as much as 8/(3π) ≃ 0.85 times the semisphere
(a = h) impedance, Eq. (52), while for long masks the impedance decreases slowly: at l/h = 20, it is still
0.54 of that for the semisphere.

In practice, however, the mask has usually an abrupt cut toward the incident synchrotron radiation,
so that it is rather one-half of a long mask. From considerations above one can suggest as a reasonable
impedance estimate for such a discontinuity the half sum of the impedances given by Eqs. (53) and (54).
This estimate is corroborated by 3D numerical simulations using the MAFIA code, at least, for the masks
which are not too long. In fact, the low-frequency impedances of a semisphere and a half semisphere of the
same depth — which can be considered as a relatively short realistic mask — were found numerically to
be almost equal (within the errors), and close to that for a longer half mask. From these results one can
conclude that a good estimate for the mask impedance is given simply by Eq. (52).

5.4 Axisymmetric Discontinuities

Following a similar procedure one can also easily obtain the results for axisymmetric irises having a semi-
elliptic proﬁle in the longitudinal chamber cross section, with depth b = h and length 2a along the beam. For
that purpose, one should consider limit c → ∞ in Eq. (48) to calculate the eﬀective polarizabilities ˜αe and
˜αm per unit length of the circumference of the chamber transverse cross section. The broad-band impedances
of axisymmetric discontinuities have been studied in [10], and the longitudinal coupling impedance is given
by

Z(k) = −ikZ0

˜αe + ˜αm

2πR

,

(55)

quite similar to Eq. (40). As c → ∞, the integral Ic → 0, and Ib is expressed in elementary functions as

and the resulting impedance of the iris of depth h with the semielliptic proﬁle is simply

(56)

(57)

which proves to be independent of the iris thickness a. The same result has been obtained using another
method [24], and also directly by conformal mapping in [15], following the general method of [10].

Using a conformal mapping, one can readily obtain an answer also for irises having the proﬁle shaped
as a circle segment with the chord of length s along the chamber wall in the longitudinal direction, and
opening angle 2ϕ, where 0 ≤ ϕ ≤ π. The impedance of such an exotic iris, expressed in terms of its height

Again, the impedance is proportional to h2, but the coeﬃcient now depends (in fact, rather weakly) on ϕ.
A few useful results for low-frequency impedances of axisymmetric cavities and irises with a rectangular,
trapezoidal and triangular transverse proﬁle have been obtained in [10] using conformal mapping to calculate
the electric polarizability.

6 Summary

A review of calculating the beam coupling impedances of small discontinuities was presented. We also
collected some analytical formulas for the inductive contributions due to various small obstacles to the beam
coupling impedances of the vacuum chamber.

An importance of understanding these eﬀects can be illustrated by the following example. An original
design of the beam liner for the LHC vacuum chamber anticipated a circular liner with many circular holes
of 2-mm radius, providing the pumping area about 5% of the liner surface. Their total contribution to the
low-frequency coupling impedance was calculated [3] to be

|Z/n| = 0.53 Ω,

|Z⊥| = 20 M Ω/m ,

which was close or above (for Z⊥) the estimated instability threshold. A modiﬁed liner design had about
the same pumping area provided by rounded-end slots 1.5 × 6 mm2, which were placed near the corners of
the rounded-square cross section of the liner [7]. As a result of these changes, the coupling impedances were
reduced by more than an order of magnitude, 30-50 times:

|Z/n| = 0.017 Ω,

|Z⊥| = 0.4 M Ω/m .

Now the pumping slots are not among the major contributors to the impedance budget of the machine.

One should mention that these notes do not include more recent developments, in particular, results
for coaxial structures, frequency corrections for polarizabilities, etc. Some of these new results and proper
references can be found in [16].

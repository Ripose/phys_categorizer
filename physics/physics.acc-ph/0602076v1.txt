Abstract

We propose and analyze a novel regenerative ampliﬁer free electron laser (FEL) to produce fully

coherent x-ray pulses. The method makes use of narrow-bandwidth Bragg crystals to form an x-

ray feedback loop around a relatively short undulator. Self-ampliﬁed spontaneous emission (SASE)

from the leading electron bunch in a bunch train is spectrally ﬁltered by the Bragg reﬂectors and

is brought back to the beginning of the undulator to interact repeatedly with subsequent bunches

in the bunch train. The FEL interaction with these short bunches not only ampliﬁes the radiation

intensity but also broadens its spectrum, allowing for eﬀective transmission of the x-rays outside

the crystal bandwidth. The spectral brightness of these x-ray pulses is about two to three orders

of magnitude higher than that from a single-pass SASE FEL.

An x-ray free electron laser (FEL) based on self-ampliﬁed spontaneous emission (SASE)

is an important ﬁrst step towards a hard x-ray laser and is expected to revolutionize the

ultrafast x-ray science (see, e.g., Refs. [1, 2]). Despite its full transverse coherence, a SASE

x-ray FEL starts up from electron shot noise and is a chaotic light temporally. Two schemes

have been proposed to improve the temporal coherence of a SASE FEL in a single pass

conﬁguration. A high-gain harmonic generation (HGHG) FEL uses available seed lasers

at ultraviolet wavelengths and reaches for shorter wavelengths through cascaded harmonic

generation [3]. In this process, the ratio of electron shot noise to the laser signal is ampliﬁed

by at least the square of the harmonic order and may limit its ﬁnal wavelength reach to the

soft x-ray region [4]. Another approach uses a two-stage SASE FEL and a monochromator

between the stages [5]. The SASE FEL from the ﬁrst undulator is spectrally ﬁltered by a

monochromator and is then ampliﬁed to saturation in the second undulator. This approach

requires an undulator system almost twice as long as a single-stage SASE FEL.

Another seeding scheme, a regenerative ampliﬁer FEL (RAFEL), has been demonstrated

in the infrared wavelength region [6] and discussed in the ultraviolet wavelength region [7]. It

consists of a small optical feedback and a high-gain FEL undulator. In the hard x-ray region,

perfect crystals may be used in the Bragg reﬂection geometry for x-ray feedback [8, 9] and

have been demonstrated experimentally for x-ray photon storage (see, e.g., Ref. [10, 11]).

In this paper, we propose and analyze a novel x-ray RAFEL using narrow-bandwidth, high-

reﬂectivity Bragg mirrors. The basic schematic is shown in Fig. 1. Three Bragg crystals are

used to form a ring x-ray cavity around a relatively short undulator. Alternative backscat-

tering geometry with a pair of crystals may also be used. SASE radiation from the leading

electron bunch in a bunch train is spectrally ﬁltered by the Bragg reﬂectors and is brought

back to the beginning of the undulator to interact with the second bunch. This process

continues bunch to bunch, yielding an exponentially growing laser ﬁeld in the x-ray cavity.

The FEL interaction with these short bunches not only ampliﬁes the radiation intensity but

also broadens its spectrum. The downstream crystal transmits the part of the radiation

spectrum outside its bandwidth and feeds back the ﬁltered radiation to continue the ampli-

ﬁcation process. Compared to a SASE x-ray FEL that typically requires more than 100 m of

undulator distance, this approach uses a signiﬁcantly shorter undulator but a small number

of electron bunches to generate multi-GW x-ray pulses with excellent temporal coherence.

The resulting spectral brightness of these x-ray pulses can be another two to three orders of

magnitude higher than the SASE FEL.

We ﬁrst consider a one-dimensional (1-D) model of the narrow-bandwidth RAFEL to

describe its main characteristics such as the temporal proﬁle, the round-trip power gain and

the maximum extraction eﬃciency. At the beginning of the nth undulator pass, the radiation

ﬁeld is represented by En(t), where t is the arrival time relative to the longitudinal center

of the electron bunch. The radiation ﬁeld at the exit of the undulator is

where δEn(t) is the SASE signal of the nth electron bunch. When the radiation slippage

length is much smaller than the electron bunch length, we can assume the electric ﬁeld gain

factor g(t) is a function of the local beam current which can be approximated by

For a high-gain ampliﬁer after a few passes, the seed signal dominates over the SASE, so

As a numerical example, we discuss how the proposed RAFEL might be implemented in

the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) [1]. The x-ray wavelength is chosen to be about
1.55 ˚A since diamond (400) crystals may be used at a Bragg angle θB = 60◦. The diamond
(115) reﬂection plane may be as well chosen at 1.2 ˚A for the same Bragg angle. Three such

crystals are necessary to form an x-ray cavity as shown in Fig. 1. The reﬂectivity curve of a

100-µm-thick diamond (400) crystal for the 8-keV, π-polarized radiation is shown in Fig. 2 as

computed by XOP [12]. The x-ray reﬂectivity R

In order to accelerate a long bunch train in the SLAC linac, we use the entire rf macropulse

available without the rf pulse compression (SLED). The maximum LCLS linac energy, with-

out the SLED, is about 10 GeV. Table I lists the beam and undulator parameters that are

typical for x-ray FELs such as the LCLS, except that the length of the undulator is only

20 m instead of more than 100 m planned for the LCLS. We perform the three-dimensional
(3-D) GENESIS [13] FEL simulation that shows the maximum power gain G0 ≈
20-m undulator, with the fwhm relative gain bandwidth about 2

39 after the
10−3 (see Fig. 3). The

LCLS accelerator and bunch compressor systems are expected to generate a bunch current

proﬁle which is more ﬂattop than Gaussian, with a ﬂattop duration T = 100 fs [1]. If we

take στ

T /2.35 and σm

that the round-trip gain Geﬀ ≈

each of three cavity arms in Fig. 1), the duration of the 10-bunch train is about 2.25 µs, well

within the 3.5-µs uncompressed rf pulse length even after taking into account the structure

the shot-to-shot radiation energy ﬂuctuates up 90% in the exponential growth stage but

quickly reduces to about 5% at the end of the 10th pass. Although a monochromator may

also be used in a saturated SASE FEL to select a single longitudinal mode, the radiation

power will be reduced by the ratio of the SASE bandwidth to the monochromator bandwidth,

and the ﬁltered radiation energy still ﬂuctuates 100%.

While we consider a ring x-ray cavity with 60◦ Bragg reﬂection for illustration, the RAFEL

scheme and its analysis presented in the paper is equally applicable to a backscattered x-ray
cavity with 90◦ Bragg reﬂection. The round-trip time of such a cavity is only two thirds of

the ring cavity shown in Fig. 1, allowing for 50% more electron bunches in a bunch train
of the same duration to participate in the RAFEL process. The reﬂectivity at exactly 90◦

Bragg reﬂection for cubic crystals such as diamond may be complicated by multiple-wave

diﬀraction and has not been studied here. Crystals with lower structure symmetry such as

sapphire may provide the necessary high reﬂectivity in backscattering as demonstrated in

9

Ref. [11].

In summary, we have described a narrow-bandwidth regenerative ampliﬁer FEL (RAFEL)

at the hard x-ray wavelength region using Bragg crystals that produces nearly transform

limited x-ray pulses in both transverse and longitudinal dimensions. Compared to a SASE
x-ray source that possesses a typical bandwidth on the order of 10−3, the bandwidth of

an x-ray RAFEL can be more than two orders of magnitude smaller, resulting in a factor

of a few hundred improvement in spectral brightness of the radiation source. The use of

multiple bunches in a bunch train for regenerative ampliﬁcation allows for a relatively short

undulator system and may be adapted in the LCLS using the SLAC s-band linac. Since

superconducting rf structures can support a much longer bunch train in an rf macropulse,

an x-ray RAFEL based on a superconducting linac may require a much lower single pass

gain and hence relax some of beam and jitter requirements provided that the additional

radiation damage to the x-ray optics is tolerable. Therefore, the method described in this

paper is a promising approach to achieve a fully coherent x-ray laser.

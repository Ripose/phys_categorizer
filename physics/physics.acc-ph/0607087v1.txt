Abstract

We present a novel method to characterize the e± phase
space at the IP of the SLAC B-factory, that combines
single-beam measurements with a detailed mapping of
luminous-region observables. Transverse spot sizes are de-
termined in the two rings with synchrotron-light monitors
and extrapolated to the IP using measured lattice func-
tions. The speciﬁc luminosity, which is proportional to
the inverse product of the overlap IP beam sizes, is con-
tinuously monitored using radiative–Bhabha events. The
spatial variation of the luminosity and of the transverse-
boost distribution of the colliding e±, are measured using
e+e− → µ+µ− events reconstructed in the BABAR de-
tector. The combination of these measurements provide
constraints on the emittances, horizontal and vertical spot
sizes, angular divergences and β functions of both beams
at the IP during physics data-taking. Preliminary results
of this combined spot-size analysis are confronted with in-
dependent measurements of IP β-functions and overlap IP
beam sizes at low beam current.

INTRODUCTION

The BABAR detector [1] is located at the interaction
point (IP) of the PEP-II asymmetric B Factory [2], where
3.1 GeV positrons from the low-energy ring (LER) col-
lide with 9.0 GeV electrons from the high-energy ring
(HER). The LER has two beam proﬁle monitors: a visible
synchrotron-light monitor (SLML) [3] in a high-coupling
region, and an X-ray monitor (SXML) [4] at a separate
location. The HER is equipped with one SLMH. In both
rings, the vertical beam size at the SLM is measured using
a companion interferometer [5]. The BABAR tracking sys-
tem is used to measure the three-dimensional distribution
of e+e− → µ+µ− vertices [6] and the transverse-boost
distribution [7] of the muon pairs. This paper describes a
ﬁrst attempt at characterizing the phase space of the collid-
ing beams by combining all the available information.

The strategy is outlined in Fig. 1. In each ring, proﬁle-
monitor data are combined with measured lattice functions
to extract the eigenmode emittances ǫ1,2 and predict the e±
IP spot sizes. The z-dependence of the luminosity L, of the
luminous size σ(x/y)L and of the boost angular divergence
σ(x′/y′)B allow the determination, under high-luminosity

biguously determined from, the indicated distributions.

USE OF BEAM-PROFILE MONITORS

The projected beam sizes σx and σy and the tilt angle
ψ of the transverse proﬁle are measured at each of the
three spot-size monitors. Lattice properties are measured
by resonant excitation, one ring at a time in single-bunch
mode. The beam-position monitor data are analyzed using
a model-independent technique (MIA) [8], and ﬁtted in the
context of the LEGO package [9] to produce a set of fully-
coupled lattice functions using the formalism of Ref. [10].
The same procedure predicts the e± eigenemittances in the
absence of beam-beam interactions.

Using, at each proﬁle monitor, the measured one-turn
matrix extracted above, one can express the measured beam
size in terms of two (unknown) eigenmode emittances ǫ1,2

The eigenemittance being an invariant, it should not de-
pend on where around the ring it is measured. In order to
verify the consistency of the ﬁtted lattice functions with the
proﬁle-monitor data, dedicated beam-size measurements
were performed at low bunch currents in both single- and
colliding-beam conﬁgurations. Table 1 summarizes the
eigenemittances inferred using various combinations of in-
put measurements. The errors quoted assume a ±10% un-
certainty on each measured spot size and ±2o on the tilt an-
gles. The results for ǫ1,L are consistent within errors. The
unphysical values of ǫ2,L are probably due to the fact that
the SLML vertical beam size is dominated by ǫ1, so that
small measurement or lattice-function errors have a dispro-
portionate impact on ǫ2. In contrast, the nominal coupling
is zero at SXML and its ǫ2 measurement intrinsically more
reliable. The most robust LER result is provided by a con-
strained SVD ﬁt that combines all the experimental infor-
mation available at SLML and SXML. Except for ǫ1,H
which is more than a factor of two larger than expected, the
eigenemittances inferred from the proﬁle monitors are ac-
ceptably consistent with those predicted by the simulation.
An additional check is provided by collision data. The
e− and e+ IP spot sizes are estimated by combining proﬁle-
monitor results with the values of the lattice parameters ex-
trapolated to the IP. The resulting predicted overlap beam
sizes Σ2
HER,j (j = major, minor)
and tilts can then be compared to those measured by an
overconstrained set of beam-beam scans [10]. This pro-
cedure is only feasible at low bunch current, when the
beam-beam parameters are small enough not to distort the
one-turn matrix or render such scans impractical. The

pred,j = σ2

LER,j + σ2

results are summarised in Table 2. The discrepancy be-
tween the measured and predicted values of Σmajor is due
to the unphysically large value of ǫ1,H.
If instead one
estimates ǫ1,H using Σmsrd,major and σLER,major, one
obtains ǫ1,H = 28+7
−9 nm-rad, which is closer to expec-
tations than the value inferred from SLMH. Similarly,
the speciﬁc luminosity Lsp inferred from Σmsrd (Lsp =
4.0 µb−1s−1bunch−1(mA/bunch)−2) is consistent with
that directly measured by the radiative-Bhabha monitor
(Lsp = 4.3), and signiﬁcantly larger than that predicted us-
ing Σpred (Lsp = 2.5+0.4
−0.5). The primary mirror for SLMH
(a water-cooled mirror in vacuum that withstands a large
heat load) is known to have mechanical stresses that may
distort the image somewhat.

Spot sizes were also recorded at somewhat higher cur-
rents. In the absence of collisions and with an e+ current
far below any potential e−-cloud threshold, the emittances
should remain the same. The observed values are compa-
rable to the low-current results (Table 1). The increase in
ǫ2,L may be caused by thermal orbit distortions. The al-
ready large horizontal HER spot size appears to grow with
current.

Data recorded with high-current colliding beams exhibit
a sizeable increase in the vertical SXML and in both
SLML spot sizes, which is qualitatively consistent with
the dynamic-β effect and with beam-beam vertical blowup.
But the observed spot sizes result in inconsistent emittance
estimates, presumably highlighting the fact that the addi-
tional focusing caused by the beam-beam interaction must
imperatively be taken into account in the one-turn matrix.

LUMINOUS-REGION ANALYSIS

The size of the luminous ellipsoid [6] and the transverse-
boost distribution [7] of the colliding electron and positron
are measured using e+e− → µ+µ− events reconstructed

in the BABAR detector. The spatial variation of these ob-
servables is determined by the emittances, IP β-functions
and waist locations of the colliding beams.

In the horizontal plane, β∗

xH/L is much larger than the
bunch lengths σzH/L, so the horizontal beam parameters
are only weakly apparent in the z-dependence of luminous-
region variables. But in the vertical plane, β∗
yH/L ∼
σzH/L, resulting in an observable z-dependence of the lu-
minosity, of the angular spread of the boost direction and
of the vertical size of the luminous region. Fitting an effec-
tive IP β-function to the ﬁrst two observables and neglect-
ing x-y coupling yields similar results, in the range of 12–
16 mm [6]; ﬁts to σyL (z) yield somewhat higher values,
but with larger systematic uncertainties. An effective verti-
cal emittance can then be extracted from σyL (z = 0); the
more powerful boost technique allows to determine both
the HER and LER emittances, yielding ǫyH,L ∼2.5–9 nm-
rad (again under the no-coupling assumption) [7]. Com-
bining the emittance and β∗ results from the boost mea-
surement yields estimates of Σy in the range of 7–10 µm,
that displays the expected anticorrelation with the speciﬁc
luminosity (Fig. 2). Because Lsp ∼ 1/ΣxΣy, the slope of
this correlation provides a measurement of Σx.

Further combining Σx with the horizontal luminous size
σxL [6] determines both e+ and e− horizontal IP spot
sizes (Fig. 3). These are then ﬁnally combined with
the horizontal-boost angular spread σx′
and the hori-
zontal angle-position correlation (δx′/δx)B [7] to extract
β∗
xH,L. The reduction in horizontal spot size caused by the
dynamic-β effect is strikingly apparent. The value of β∗
xH
extracted from BABAR data before the move to the half-
integer, is consistent with low-current phase advance mea-
surements recorded at that time. In the same period how-
ever, the corresponding β∗
xL result is signiﬁcantly smaller
than the phase-advance measurements. In addition, the hor-
izontal LER emittance implied by Fig. 3 is surprisingly
large, possibly signaling an inconsistency in this prelimi-
nary analysis.

functions (bottom) in the LER (open circles) and the HER
(black dots), extracted from luminous-region observables
measured by BABAR. The dotted line indicates the time
when both x tunes were moved close to the half-integer,
resulting in a sizeable luminosity improvement.

CONCLUSION

Confronting IP beam sizes extrapolated from the pro-
ﬁle monitors with a detailed phase-space characterization
based on luminous-region observables would provide in-
valuable consistency checks, as well as restrict system-
atic uncertainties. Two main ingredients are required to
this effect. First, beam-beam focusing needs to be taken
into account in the one-turn matrix of Ref. [10]; guidance
can be provided here by beam-beam simulations. Sec-
ond, x-y coupling at the IP needs to be incorporated in the
luminous-region analyses, as its impact has recently been
shown [6, 7] to be signiﬁcant.

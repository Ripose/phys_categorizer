Abstract

We consider modeling for strong-strong beam-beam interactions beyond preceding lin-
earized/perturbative methods such as soft gaussian approximation or FMM (HFMM) etc.
In our approach discrete coherent modes, discovered before, and possible incoherent oscil-
lations appear as a result of multiresolution/multiscale fast convergent decomposition in the
bases of high-localized exact nonlinear modes represented by wavelets or wavelet packets
functions. The constructed solutions represent the full multiscale spectrum in all internal hid-
den scales from slow to fast oscillating eigenmodes. Underlying variational method provides
algebraical control of the spectrum.

Abstract

We consider modeling for strong-strong beam-beam in-
teractions beyond preceding linearized/perturbative meth-
ods such as soft gaussian approximation or FMM (HFMM)
etc.
In our approach discrete coherent modes, discov-
ered before, and possible incoherent oscillations appear as
a result of multiresolution/multiscale fast convergent de-
composition in the bases of high-localized exact nonlinear
modes represented by wavelets or wavelet packets func-
tions. The constructed solutions represent the full mul-
tiscale spectrum in all internal hidden scales from slow
to fast oscillating eigenmodes. Underlying variational
method provides algebraical control of the spectrum.

INTRODUCTION

We consider the ﬁrst steps of analysis of beam-beam in-
teractions in some collective model approach. It is well-
known that neither direct PIC modeling nor soft-gaussian
approximation provide reasonable resolution of computing
time/noise problems and understanding of underlying com-
plex nonlinear dynamics [1], [2]. Recent analysis, based as
on numerical simulation as on modeling, demonstrates that
presence of coherent modes inside the spectrum leads to
oscillations and growth of beam transverse size and defor-
mations of beam shape. This leads to strong limitations for
operation of LHC. Additional problems appear as a result
of continuum spectrum of incoherent oscillations in each
beam. The strong-strong collisions of two beams also lead
to variation of transverse size. According to [2] it is reason-
able to ﬁnd nonperturbative solutions at least in the impor-
tant particular cases. Our approach based on wavelet anal-
ysis technique is in some sense the direct generalization
of Fast Multipole Method (FMM) and related approaches
(HFMM). After set-up based on Vlasov-like model (ac-
cording [2]) in part 2, we consider variational-wavelet ap-
proach [3]-[17] in framework of powerful technique based
on Fast Wavelet Transform (FWT) operator representa-
tions [18] in section 3. As a result we have multiresolu-
tion/multiscale fast convergent decomposition in the bases
of high-localized exact nonlinear eigenmodes represented
by wavelets or wavelet packets functions. The constructed
solutions represent the full multiscale spectrum in all inter-
nal hidden scales from slow to fast oscillating eigenmodes.
Underlying variational method provides algebraical control
of the spectrum.

and ψ∗ is the density of the opposite beam, qx is unper-
turbed fractional tune, ξx is horizontal beam-beam param-
eter, N is a number of particles, x, px are normalized
variables. This model describes horizontal oscillations of
ﬂat beams with one bunch per beam, one interaction point,
equal energy, population and optics for both beams.

3 FWT BASED VARIATIONAL

APPROACH

One of the key points of wavelet approach demonstrates
that for a large class of operators wavelets are good ap-
proximation for true eigenvectors and the corresponding
matrices are almost diagonal. FWT [18] gives the maxi-
mum sparse form of operators under consideration (1). It
is true also in case of our Vlasov-like system of equations
(1). We have both differential and integral operators inside.
So, let us denote our (integral/differential) operator from
equations (1) as T (L2(Rn)
L2(Rn)) and its kernel as
K. We have the following representation:

→

< T f, g >=

K(x, y)f (y)g(x)dxdy

(3)

In case when f and g are wavelets ϕj,k = 2j/2ϕ(2jx

(3) provides the standard representation for operator T . Let
us consider multiresolution representation . . .
V2 ⊂
V−2 . . .. The basis in each Vj is
V1 ⊂
V−1 ⊂
ϕj,k(x), where indices k, j represent translations and scal-
ing respectively. Let Pj : L2(Rn)
Z) be pro-
jection operators on the subspace Vj corresponding to level
k < f, ϕj,k > ϕj,k(x). Let
j of resolution: (Pjf )(x) =
Pj be the projection operator on the subspace
Qj = Pj−1 −
Wj ) then we have the following ”micro-
Wj (Vj−1 = Vj ⊕
scopic or telescopic” representation of operator T which

Vj (j

takes into account contributions from each level of reso-
lution from different scales starting with the coarsest and
ending to the ﬁnest scales [18]:

T =

(QjT Qj + QjT Pj + Pj T Qj).

(4)

Xj∈Z

We remember that this is a result of presence of afﬁne
group inside this construction. The non-standard form of
operator representation [18] is a representation of operator
T as a chain of triples T =
Aj, Bj, Γj}j∈Z , acting on
the subspaces Vj and Wj: Aj : Wj →
Wj , Bj : Vj →
Vj , where operators
Wj , Γj
Aj, Bj, Γj}j∈Z
{
are deﬁned as Aj = QjT Qj, Bj = QjT Pj, Γj =
Pj T Qj. The operator T admits a recursive deﬁnition via

: Wj →

Tj =

Aj+1 Bj+1

Vj. It should
where Tj = Pj T Pj and Tj acts on Vj : Vj →
be noted that operator Aj describes interaction on the scale
j independently from other scales, operators Bj, Γj de-
scribe interaction between the scale j and all coarser scales,
the operator Tj is an ”averaged” version of Tj−1. We
may compute such non-standard representations for differ-
ent operators (including Calderon-Zygmund or pseudodif-
ferential). As in case of differential operator as in other
cases we need only to solve the system of linear algebraical
equations. The action of integral operator in equations (1)
we may consider as a Hilbert transform

are wavelet coefﬁcients. So, we have simple linear para-
metrization of matrix representation of our operator (6) in
wavelet bases and of the action of this operator on arbitrary
vector in proper functional space. The similar approach
can be applied to other operators in (1). Then we may ap-
ply our variational approach from [3]-[17]. Let L be an
arbitrary (non) linear (differential/integral) operator corre-
sponds to the system (1) with matrix dimension d, which
acts on some set of functions Ψ
Ψ1(θ, x, px), . . . , Ψd(θ, x, px)

Qd1,d2,d3(θ, x, px, ∂/∂θ, ∂/∂x, ∂/∂px,
consider now the N mode approximation for solution as the
following ansatz (in the same way we may consider differ-
ent ansatzes) [17]:

Ψ(θ, x, px) =

proaches are considered in [3]-[16]):

(LΨN )Ak(θ)Bℓ(x)Cm(px)dθdxdpx = 0

So, we have exactly dN 3 algebraical equations for dN 3
unknowns arsk. The solution is parametrized by solutions
of two set of reduced algebraical problems, one is linear
or nonlinear (depends on the structure of operator L) and
the rest are some linear problems related to computation
of coefﬁcients of algebraic equations. These coefﬁcients
can be found by some wavelet methods by using com-
pactly supported wavelet basis functions for expansions
(12). We may consider also different types of wavelets
including general wavelet packets. The constructed solu-

tion has the following multiscale/multiresolution decom-

N,M,L and fast oscillating
parts for arbitrary N, M, L. So, we may move from coarse
scales of resolution to the ﬁnest one to obtain more detailed
information about our dynamical process. The ﬁrst terms
in the RHS of formulae (13) correspond on the global level
of function space decomposition to resolution space and
the second ones to detail space. The using of wavelet basis
with high-localized properties provides fast convergence of
constructed decomposition (13). In contrast with different
approaches, formulae (13) does not use perturbation tech-
nique or linearization procedures and represents dynamics

via generalized nonlinear localized eigenmodes expansion.
Numerical calculations are based on compactly supported
wavelets and related wavelet families. Figures 1,2 demon-

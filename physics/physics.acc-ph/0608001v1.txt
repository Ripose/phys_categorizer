Abstract

Challenging beam-induced energy deposition issues are addressed for the next generation of
the LHC high-luminosity interaction regions based on Nb3Sn quadrupoles. Detailed MARS15
Monte Carlo energy deposition calculations are performed for various coil diameters, thick-
nesses and materials of the inner absorber at a ﬁeld gradient of 200 T/m. It is shown that using
the inner absorber made of tungsten-based materials can make the ﬁnal focus superconducting
quadrupoles compatible with a luminosity of 1035 cm−2s−1.

1 Introduction

The superconducting (SC) magnets of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) under construction at
CERN are based on NbTi superconductor. The high-gradient quadrupoles for the interaction re-
gion (IR) inner triplets have been developed and manufactured by KEK and Fermilab [1]. These
quadrupoles with 70-mm coils, provide a ﬁeld gradient of 200 T/m and will allow one to achieve
the nominal luminosity of 1034 cm−2s−1. As a result of thorough optimization of the IP1/IP5 lay-
outs and low-b quadrupole design, the system was designed and built to protect the IR SC magnets
against debris generated in the pp-collisions as well as to protect magnets and detectors against
beam halo and a missteered beam coming to the IP. The system includes a set of absorbers in front
of the inner triplet (TAS), inside the triplet aperture and between the low-b quadrupoles, inside the
cryostats, in front of the D2 separation dipole (TAN), and between the outer triplet quads as well
as a complex system in IP6 and tertiary TCT collimators for the incoming beam. Their parame-
ters were optimized over the years in detailed energy deposition calculations at Fermilab to provide
better protection consistent with the engineering constraints [2].

Several possible upgrade paths are under consideration to achieve a luminosity capability of 1035
cm−2s−1 at the LHC interaction points (IP) [3, 4]. Recent progress in the development of Nb3Sn
superconductor enables one to consider Nb3Sn magnets as possible second generation quadrupoles
for the LHC IRs [5]. The quadrupole ﬁelds sweep the secondary particles from pp-collisions at
the IP into the SC coils along the vertical and horizontal planes, giving rise to a local peak power
density e max that can substantially exceed the quench limits at such luminosity, with drastically
reduced component lifetime and kW-level radiation loads on the inner triplet cryogenic system [6].
In several years of the LHC operations the magnets will have to be replaced with new quadrupoles
which should provide the possibility of achieving the ultimate luminosity of 1035 cm−2s−1.

This study is a continuation of our ﬁrst look [7] at energy deposition issues for the new IR
magnets. We address the dependence of radiation-induced energy deposition in the Nb3Sn magnets
on coil diameter, thickness and material of the inner absorber at a ﬁeld gradient of 200 T/m by
doing comprehensive energy deposition calculations with the MARS15 Monte Carlo code [8]. A
conﬁguration compatible with the luminosity of 1035 cm−2s−1 is proposed.

2 Inner Triplet Model

The calculation model of the IR is presented in Figs. 1-3. A longitudinal structure of the inner triplet
region corresponds to the LHC lattice v6.5. The updates consist in replacing the quadrupoles based
on NbTi superconductor with larger bore ones based on Nb3Sn. The four magnets in the region–Q1,
Q2A, Q2B, and Q3–differ only in length while their radial structure, excluding the inner absorber
(liner), is assumed to be the same. In this model, the baseline thickness of the liner is 6.2 mm in the
region of Q1 quadrupole with no liner all the way downstream of Q1.

According to manufacturer’s speciﬁcations, the cold cable contains 50% bronze and 50% Nb3Sn
with a speciﬁc density of 5.4 g/cm3. A nominal ﬁeld gradient of 200 T/m is used. A half crossing
angle of 212 µrad and 21-mm TAS1 aperture were assumed in the calculations performed with the
MARS15 Monte Carlo code [8]. Although some details of the model are speciﬁc to IP5 (horizontal
crossing and detector-machine transition), results are applicable to both high-luminosity interaction
regions, IP1 and IP5.

In this study we address the following two major problems relevant to beam-induced energy
deposition in the LHC IR quadrupoles: peak power density and dynamic heat load. The former
quantity enables one to determine if a magnet design under consideration is safe with respect to
quenches. It is also directly related to the peak dose accumulated in the SC coils; this allows one to
estimate their lifetime. The overall performance of the cooling system of the magnets should corre-
spond to the heat load. The normalization of the data presented below corresponds to a luminosity
of 1035 cm−2s−1. The design goal used below in connection with the peak power density has been
calculated taking into account the quench limit for Nb3Sn magnets of 5.0 mW/g [6, 9], with a safety
factor of three on top of that [2]. It gives us 1.7 mW/g for the maximum power density in the SC
coils as the design goal.

3 Peak Power Density in SC Coils

3.1 Coil aperture

A calculated distribution of peak power density, e max, in the inner triplet SC coils is shown in Fig. 4.
Here a baseline stainless steel inner absorber is used. One can see that the peak power density
exceeds the design goal signiﬁcantly.

We have studied the dependence of e max on coil diameter.

In our model developed for this
purpose the radial position of each layer, including the beam screen, was adjusted appropriately
while its thickness was kept the same (see Fig. 3). Due to lack of calculated magnetic ﬁeld maps
for coil diameters other than 90 mm, we apply a scaling procedure to the only existing ﬁeld map.
Namely, the two-dimensional distribution of the magnetic ﬁeld developed previously for 90-mm
Nb3Sn magnets [10] is adjusted in the following way: given Bx and By for a two-dimensional grid
{xn,yk}, we apply a multiplication correction factor of D(mm)/90, where D is inner coil diameter,
to the coordinates of every single point of the grid as well as to the corresponding ﬁeld components.
Being an approximation the described procedure enables us to keep the ﬁeld gradient constant.

Inner coil diameter (mm)

Figure 5: Distributions of maximum peak power density in the Nb3Sn quadrupoles vs inner coil
diameter calculated for a baseline stainless steel liner. The term ’maximum’ refers here to the
highest peak power density observed over a magnet length.

The calculated dependencies of maximum peak power density on coil diameter are shown in
Fig. 5. One can see that at a ﬁxed gradient, increasing the coil diameter from 90 to 110 mm one
decreases e max in all the quadrupoles except Q2A, where e max is slightly up due to the reduced
shielding effect of Q1. Power density is still unacceptably high. In order to understand qualitatively
the dependencies shown in Fig. 5, we have examined partial energy deposition contributions to the
hottest spot in the Q2B coil made by various shower components. A built-in tagging technique as
well as histogramming [8] were used for this purpose. The analysis revealed that more than 90% of
the total energy deposition at the hottest spot is due to electromagnetic showers induced by p 0 →
2g decays (see also Sec. 3.4). The neutral pions are generated in inner regions of the system (beam
screen, liner, cold bore) by charged hadrons coming from the IP. When increasing the coil diameter,
two opposing factors come into play: (i) increased distance between the coil and beam gives rise to
a reduction in energy deposited in the coil; (ii) to keep the same ﬁeld gradient, one has to increase
the magnetic ﬁeld itself which, in turn, gives rise to an increase in charged hadron hit rate over the
inner regions and, therefore, an increase in neutral pion production. The two factors acting together
give rise to the distributions shown in Fig. 5.

3.2 Liner thickness

In order to reduce the peak power density in the quadrupoles, one can increase the inner absorber
(liner) thickness d. A dependence of e max as a function of d has been calculated for 100-mm
quadrupoles (see Fig. 6). For 90-mm ones there is not any extra room for the absorber from Q2A
through Q3 because the beam screen is at 38.5 mm (see Fig. 2) and this is exactly the spatial limita-
tion imposed by beam optics for b ∗ = 0.25 m [5]. For 100-mm quadrupoles one has the extra room
to ﬁt a liner up to 5 mm in thickness. One can see from Fig. 6 that even with a liner of increased
thickness, e max in Q2B goes a bit beyond the design goal. Therefore, one has to rule this option out,
at least for 90-mm and 100-mm quadrupoles.

thickness of the stainless steel liner, D d. Total thickness of the liner, d, is equal to d0 + D d, where
d0 is the baseline liner thickness.

3.3 Spacers in SC coils

Another option that could help to reduce the peak power density in the coils is replacing the su-
perconductor in the hottest spots along the entire magnet length with other material—a low-Z one.
This has the advantage of providing decreased collision density and spreading the power density
peak over a bigger volume. Aluminum and graphite were studied. A model and sample power
density distribution are shown in Fig. 7. One can see that e max in the Q2B inner and outer SC coils
is about 1.8 mW/g, slightly above the design goal.

One could further reduce the peak power density using the spacer approach by choosing one of
the following options: (i) increasing the size of the spacers and extending them through the outer
coil; (ii) using other material–more dense than aluminum; (iii) using a combination of the described
aluminum spacers with a steel liner of increased thickness (see previous Section).

This approach has never been tested in practice. There are some difﬁculties with the coil design
in this approach. It is also clear that there will be some effect on the ﬁeld quality with the spacers,
thus requiring magnet optimization studies. It seems that this approach could be considered as an
auxiliary one that might be useful under other circumstances.

3.4 High-Z inner absorber

As described in Sec. 3.1, more than 90% of the energy deposition in the hottest spots of the SC coils
is due to electromagnetic showers. Fig. 8 shows the energy spectra of electrons and photons for the
hot spot in Q2B. One can see that about 50% of all photons in the region have energies from 200 to
400 keV. Therefore, a promising way to optimize the liner is to replace the stainless steel with a high-
Z material. In such a case one can take the advantage of very strong photoabsorption that, at low
energies, scales with the atomic number as ∼ Z5 (see Fig. 9). A good candidate is a commercially
available tungsten-rhenium alloy, W 25 Re, that contains 75% tungsten [12]. MARS15 calculations
have revealed that, other things being equal, the W 25 Re liner provides substantial absorption of low-
energy photons and, therefore, a signiﬁcant reduction of e max in all the quadrupoles (see Fig. 10). It
should be noted that in our model the W 25 Re is used to replace both the steel liner and the 1.5-mm
steel cold bore adjacent to the liner (see Fig. 2). The design goal is reached with a W 25 Re liner
7.2-mm thick in Q1 and 1-mm thick in the rest of the triplet.

thickness. W 25 Re is used to replace both the steel liner and 1.5-mm steel cold bore adjacent to the
liner (see Fig. 2).

4 Dynamic Heat Loads

In order to design an adequate cooling system for the inner triplet at a luminosity of 1035 cm−2s−1,
dynamic heat loads on the magnets are of primary importance. Results calculated for the liner and
superconducting coils of the IR quadrupoles are shown in Fig. 11. One can easily see the effect
of increased energy deposition in the W 25 Re liner when compared to the steel one. It follows
from Fig. 11 that the W 25 Re liner provides for an overall better protection for the superconducting
coils in the inner triplet. It also mitigates the local huge spike at the IP end of the Q2A quadrupole
observed when using the steel liner. At the same time, the total dynamic heat load (see Fig. 12) does
not vary signiﬁcantly with liner because the liner is responsible mostly for an internal re-distribution
of the energy deposited in the system.

The integral of the dynamic heat load is presented in Table 1. It should be noted that: (i) the
data given in the second column of the Table refers to the energy deposited not only in the liner
itself but also in the beam screen (see Figs. 2 and 3); (ii) in addition to the beam screen, liner,
and superconducting coils, the other parts of the quadrupoles also contribute to the total heat load
presented in the last column of the Table.

Since the total dynamic heat load scales with luminosity and the modiﬁcations discussed above
to the quadrupoles do not give rise to signiﬁcant variation, the heat load remains the outstanding
constraint on the cooling system capability and the cryoplant cost. One can see from Fig. 11 that a
separate cooling system for the liner, maintained at liquid nitrogen temperatures, could provide for
a solution to this problem and should be studied in detail. With such a separate cooling system and
a W 25 Re liner of increased thickness, the dynamic heat load to the superconducting coils would
not exceed 20 W/m with a total heat load to the coils of 307 W.

5 Conclusions

The calculated data on peak power density and dynamic heat load to the LHC inner triplet with
Nb3Sn quadrupoles is presented at an ultimate luminosity of 1035 cm−2s−1. In order to reduce the
peak power density to an acceptable level, various options were studied: (i) increasing inner coil
diameter (90, 100, and 110 mm); (ii) increasing thickness of the inner absorber (liner); (iii) replacing
the material of the liner with a tungsten-based alloy (W 25 Re) instead of stainless steel; (iv) using
spacers in the hottest spots of the SC coils. A W 25 Re liner of increased thickness (7.2 mm in the
Q1 region and 1 mm from Q2A through Q3) provides for the most effective shielding and allows
us to reach the design goal of 1.7 mW/g for the 100-mm Nb3Sn quadrupoles. The calculated total
dynamic heat load to the inner triplet is about 1300 W. In order to cope with the heat load at that
level, a separate cooling system for the inner absorber, maintained at liquid nitrogen temparatures,
might be required.

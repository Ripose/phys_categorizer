Abstract. The Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory is investigating an accel-
erator upgrade project that would replace the present 130 nm·rad FODO lattice with
an 18 nm·rad double bend achromat (DBA) lattice: SPEAR 3. The low emittance
design yields a high brightness beam, but the stronger focusing in the DBA lattice
increases chromaticity and beam sensitivity to machine errors. To ensure eﬃcient in-
jection and long Touschek lifetime, an optimization of the design lattice and dynamic
aperture has been performed. In this paper, we review the methods used to maximize
the SPEAR 3 dynamic aperture including necessary optics modiﬁcations, choice of tune
and phase advance, optimization of sextupole and coupling correction, and modeling
eﬀects of machine errors, wigglers and lattice periodicity.

INTRODUCTION

SPEAR 3 is the 3 GeV upgrade project under study at SSRL [1]. It aims at
replacing the current 130 nm·rad FODO lattice with an 18 nm·rad low emittance
double bend achromat (DBA) lattice. To minimize the cost of the project and to
use the existing synchrotron light beam lines, the new design [2,3] closely follows
the racetrack conﬁguration of the SPEAR tunnel, with the magnet positions ﬁt to
the 18 magnet girders shown in Fig. 1. As in the current design, the SPEAR 3
lattice has two-fold symmetry and periodicity with two identical arcs and two long
straight sections. Each arc in the new lattice has 7 identical symmetric cells, and
each straight section consists of two mirror symmetric matching cells.

The lattice functions of one quarter of the ring are shown in Fig. 2. The two
bends and a quadrupole in the middle of each DBA cell compensate the dispersion,
while the two quadrupole doublets at each end control the tune and cell β functions.
Since the new lattice cells have to ﬁt to the existing 11.7 m cell length, it results
in a compact DBA design, and hence increases the focusing. Similar to other
light source lattices, it has been found advantageous to add vertical focusing to
the bends [5–8] to relax the optics and reduce the strength of cell sextupoles by
increasing the diﬀerence in their β functions [9]. Each matching cell has an extra
quadrupole for a better optics matching, two 3/4 bends, with magnet positions
adjusted to maintain the ring circumference [4] (the current 358.53 MHz RF system
will be used), and quadrupole strengths adjusted to optimize β functions and phase
advance.

Though the DBA design has an advantage of a high brightness beam, its eﬀect on
the beam dynamics has to be veriﬁed. First, the lower emittance results in a higher

particle density which increases probability of particle collisions inside the bunches
and makes the Touschek eﬀect the limiting factor for the beam lifetime. Secondly,
the stronger focusing in the DBA lattice increases beam sensitivity to magnetic
and chromatic errors and generates larger chromaticity. The latter requires strong
sextupole correctors which increase the amplitude dependent and non-linear chro-
matic aberrations. These eﬀects tend to reduce the dynamic aperture, and if the
aperture is not suﬃcient for momentum errors up to δ = 3% it will further reduce
the Touschek beam lifetime. Adequate dynamic aperture is also important in order
to minimize losses during horizontal oscillations of the injected beam.

Consequently, the low emittance design has to be optimized to achieve the max-

size of dynamic aperture to minimize the Touschek eﬀect and allow large injection
oscillations in SPEAR 3. The improvement of dynamic aperture starts from opti-
mization of linear optics and correction systems. In the following sections we review
the modiﬁcations made to the initial lattice design and present tracking studies in-
cluding eﬀects of magnetic and chromatic errors, perturbation due to wigglers, and
the eﬀect of lattice periodicity.

All of the tracking study has been done using the LEGO code [10] which employs

element-by-element tracking based on symplectic integration techniques [11]. In a
few cases we tested LEGO results against other available tracking codes and found
good agreement. In our study we calculated dynamic aperture at injection point
located at the symmetry point between arc cells where βx = 10.1 m and βy = 4.8 m.
The other typical parameters were: number of tracking turns N = 1024, linear
chromaticity corrected to zero, and synchrotron oscillations included.

ERROR FREE DYNAMIC APERTURE

Typically, the error free dynamic aperture serves as an upper limit for the aper-
ture with machine errors or with insertion devices (ID). It is therefore important
to maximize ﬁrst the dynamic aperture for the ideal lattice without any magnetic
or misalignment errors. Maximizing the error free dynamic aperture necessarily
involves optimization of linear optics and the chromaticity correction system, min-
imization of chromatic and high order eﬀects, and optimizing the betatron tune.

Cell Optics

The DBA cell optics was made to ﬁt the existing 11.7 m cell length with the mag-
net positions constrained to provide ∼ 3 m space for the insertion devices and with
bend positions kept to ﬁt to the current synchrotron light beam lines. This results
in a compact DBA design which leads to stronger focusing and, hence, increased
beam sensitivity to machine errors. Though the achromat lattice eliminates dis-
persion in the insertion devices and at injection, it limits the available positions for
chromatic sextupoles to rather short dispersive regions between the bends and the
middle quadrupole QFC. The close proximity of the SF and SD sextupoles reduces
their eﬀectiveness and requires larger strengths.

To relax the cell optics it has been found advantageous to add vertical focusing
to the cell bends. This results in a better separation of horizontal and vertical
focusing and reduces the quadrupole strength in the doublets. Most importantly,
due to increased βy at SD sextupoles it provides better optical separation between
the SF and SD and reduces their strength. To further reduce the strengths of the
sextupoles and QFC quadrupole, the bends were placed as far from the cell center
as it is possible within existing geometric constraints.

Working Tune and Phase Advance

The choice for the phase advance in the arc cells was to be near µx ≈ 0.75 × 2π
and µy ≈ 0.25 × 2π. This provides favorable conditions for local cancellation of:
1) geometric aberrations from arc sextupoles located −I apart, and 2) ﬁrst order
chromatic beta waves from sextupoles and quadrupoles located 90o apart, as well
as systematic quadrupole errors. It is worth to note that the high horizontal phase
advance is due to the achromat design which requires µx = π between the bends.

Initially, the matching cells were designed to provide I-transformation between
the two arcs in both planes [12]. This would give the advantage of having eﬀectively
a 14-period lattice since the matching cells would be virtually invisible in the ﬁrst
order to the on-momentum particles. Generally, the high periodicity optics provides
better cancellation of systematic errors.

With the above choices the total tune would be near νx ≈ 14.5 and νy ≈ 5.5. To
move the working tune away from the half integer resonance, the phase advance
in arc and/or matching cells has to be adjusted. To minimize the resistive wall
impedance eﬀects [13] it is favorable to move the tune into the lower quarter on
the tune plane (ν < 1/2). Tracking studies showed that relaxing the phase advance
through the matching cells improves the SPEAR 3 oﬀ-momentum dynamic aperture
since it reduces the chromaticity and the strengths of matching quads. On the other
hand, relaxing the arc cells would increase the arc sextupole strengths because of
unfavorable change of the cell β functions at the sextupoles.

The optimum phase conditions have been identiﬁed by performing a horizontal
dynamic aperture scan across the matching cell phase advance µx and µy. The on-
momentum and oﬀ-momentum dynamic aperture were maximized at about µx =
0.78 × 2π and µy = 0.42 × 2π per matching cell.

To minimize the eﬀect of strong low order betatron resonances the location of
the working tune on the tune plane has been chosen slightly below .25, away from
the 3rd and 4th order resonance lines. The ﬁnal choice (νx = 14.19, νy = 5.23)
was based on favorable horizontal injection conditions and the results of dynamic
aperture tune scan. The two dimensional diagram of horizontal dynamic aperture
(in number of σx) versus x and y tune is shown in Table 1, where σx ≈ 0.45 mm is
the horizontal rms beam size at injection point. During the aperture scan the tune
was varied by changing arc phase advance, and the lattice was kept matched at all
tunes. The above scan also included a set of random machine errors which will be
described in the following sections. With the chosen tune, the phase advance per
arc cell is µx = 0.7907 × 2π and µy = 0.2536 × 2π. The location of the working tune
on the tune plane along with betatron resonance lines up to 4th order is shown in
Fig. 3.

Chromatic Correction

Eﬃcient chromatic correction is essential for a large oﬀ-momentum dynamic
aperture and for a long Touschek lifetime. Since the sextupoles also give rise to
non-linear geometric aberrations it is important to minimize these eﬀects by using
compensation techniques and reducing the sextupole strengths.

As mentioned previously, the choice for phase advance in the arc cells provides
conditions for local compensation of sextupole geometric aberrations and chromatic
beta waves from arc quadrupoles and sextupoles. This scheme would work opti-
mally if the number of arc cells was 4 × integer . With 7 arc cells in the design,
however, this correction is not complete, and the geometric constraints do not allow

for 8 identical arc cells.

The chromaticity correction using only two sextupole families in the arc cells does
not provide adequate dynamic aperture for oﬀ-momentum particles. Since the two
family sextupoles can only compensate the linear chromaticity, the oﬀ-momentum
aperture is mostly aﬀected by the non-linear chromatic eﬀects. The reason for
the large high order chromaticity is due to the matching cells which contribute
about 20% to the total chromaticity and break periodicity of the 14 arc cells. Two
additional families of sextupoles (SFI, SDI) placed in the matching cells, similar
to the arc cells, help to reduce the non-linear terms and signiﬁcantly improve the
oﬀ-momentum dynamic aperture. Table 2 compares HARMON [14] calculations of
the high order chromaticity for the lattice with and without SFI, SDI sextupoles.

The matching cell sextupoles also generate geometric aberrations and therefore
have to be kept relatively weak in order to preserve the on-momentum aperture.
The optimum strengths of the matching cell sextupoles have been evaluated by

performing a horizontal aperture scan versus SFI, SDI strengths while using the
arc sextupoles to keep the ring chromaticity constant. Other chromatic correction
schemes which use more sextupole families in the arcs did not result in a better
aperture.

As it was mentioned earlier, the close proximity of the SF, SD sextupoles in
the short dispersive region between bends and QFC quadrupole reduces the ef-
fectiveness of the sextupoles and increases their strength. To increase the optical
separation of the sextupoles two other options were studied.
In one option, the
SD sextupole was moved away from the SF by combining with part of the adja-
cent bend. This increased the βy function at the SD, but the dispersion inside the
bend was rather low. The tracking study showed that the dynamic aperture re-
duces in this option. In the second study, the SF sextupole was combined with the
QFC quadrupole. Due to higher dispersion and βx at the QFC, this led to weaker
SF sextupoles and potentially reduced high order sextupole eﬀects. The dynamic
aperture, however, did not improve using this option. Consequently, in the current
design the sextupoles are kept separate from the bends and QFC quadrupole.

is shown in Fig. 4. The axes refer to the initial particle amplitude at the injection
point, and the two curves show the boundary for the stable motion for on and oﬀ-
momentum particles. Clearly, the oﬀ-momentum aperture is very robust against
momentum errors and provides favorable conditions for a long Touschek lifetime.

EFFECT OF MACHINE ERRORS

Magnetic ﬁeld and alignment errors introduce optics perturbations and enhance
eﬀects of resonances that limit dynamic aperture. For conservative results, we
included several diﬀerent classes of magnet errors in the tracking studies includ-
ing random main ﬁeld errors, random and systematic multipole errors, and ran-
dom alignment errors. Since the skew quadrupoles combined with sextupoles in
SPEAR 3 generate a skew octupole ﬁeld, and the large orbit variation in the 10.6◦
bend samples high order multipole ﬁelds, these eﬀects were added to the error set.
The eﬀect of positive linear chromaticity, large β function distortions, orbit dis-
tortions, large amplitude coupling and insertion devices were studied. Harmonic
sextupole correction has been tried to improve the dynamic aperture, and the eﬀect
of lattice periodicity was analyzed.

Alignment and Field Errors

The magnet error and alignment speciﬁcations used for the SPEAR 3 tracking
studies can be met with standard manufacturing techniques. For tracking simula-
tions, the following values for rms errors were used with 2σ truncation to simulate
realistic quality control.

Alignment

The alignment rms errors shown in Table 3 can be achieved with survey tech-
niques used in practice and are large enough to yield conservative tracking re-
sults. The dipole alignment speciﬁcation is the same as for quadrupoles since the
SPEAR 3 dipoles include a strong quadrupole ﬁeld.

Systematic Multipole Errors

Systematic multipole ﬁeld errors are ﬁeld components of higher order than the
main ﬁeld which apply to all magnets with a common core design.
In LEGO,
the multipole errors are deﬁned in terms of a ratio of the multipole ﬁeld ∆Bn
(normal or skew) to the main magnet ﬁeld B at radius r, where n = 1, 2, 3, . . . is
the multipole order starting with a bend. The normal rms values ∆Bn/B used for
the SPEAR 3 magnets are listed in Table 4. For the quadrupole magnets, only
the allowed multipoles were used. For the gradient dipole magnets and sextupoles
combined with skew quads, all systematic multipoles were used with the largest
values shown in the Table 4.

In the SPEAR 3 design the skew quadrupoles used for coupling correction are
combined with sextupoles. Such combined magnets also generate a skew octupole
ﬁeld proportional to the skew quad strength. At radius of 32 mm the magnitude
of the octupole ﬁeld will be 57% of the skew quad ﬁeld. In the tracking, the skew
octupole component was systematically added in proportion to the skew quadrupole
ﬁeld. It is worth to note that typical skew quad strengths required for coupling
correction are less than 1% of the main ring quadrupole strengths.

Diﬀerences in magnetic core length will give rise to ∼ 10−3 random main ﬁeld
errors. Normal random multipole errors, introduced by magnet assembly imperfec-
tions, are listed in Table 5. To achieve conservative tracking results, large values
were speciﬁed for the random n =3,6,10,14 multipoles on the quadrupole magnets.

Coupling Correction

The initial design of coupling correction employed four independent skew
quadrupoles placed in non-dispersive regions in the matching cells. The four skew
quads were used to uncouple the 4 × 4 one turn transfer matrix. However, the
skew quad placement in the matching cells did not provide enough variation of the
sum and diﬀerence phase advance (µx ± µy) for eﬃcient orthogonal correction. De-
pending on the set of random machine errors, this occasionally led to strong skew
quadrupoles and reduced dynamic aperture.

Further study showed that it was beneﬁcial for dynamic aperture to use skew
quadrupole components on the chromatic sextupoles located in the dispersive re-
gions of the arc cells [3]. This conﬁguration provided a more orthogonal set of the
skew quad positions with reduced strengths. The negative eﬀects, such as induced

vertical dispersion, were small compared to improved aperture and robustness of
the correction. In total, 24 skew quads were arranged in four families and placed at
their optimum phase positions. One other negative eﬀect is that a skew quadrupole
in a sextupole magnet gives rise to a systematic skew octupole ﬁeld. In our track-
ing study, the eﬀect of this ﬁeld did not reduce the dynamic aperture. As a future
option, the large number of skew quads in the above scheme allows expansion of the
number of independent families with correction of the vertical dispersion as well.

Dynamic Aperture with Errors

For a realistic simulation with errors, LEGO ﬁrst generates and adds the chosen
set of errors to the magnets, then iteratively applies correction schemes to mini-
mize the optics perturbation, and ﬁnally tracks particles with a variety of initial
amplitudes to deﬁne the dynamic aperture. The basic set of correction schemes in
LEGO includes tune, orbit, linear chromaticity and coupling correction systems. In
the SPEAR 3 simulation, the tune was corrected by using two families of doublet
quads in the arc cells. The nominal orbit correction routine in LEGO is based on
a three corrector bump scheme, but other techniques can be implemented as well.
Typically in this study, the linear chromaticity was adjusted to zero with the two
families of sextupoles in the arc cells, while the matching cell sextupole strength
was kept constant. The coupling correction was done by using the four family skew
quad correction scheme described in the previous section. An RF voltage of 3.2 MV
was used to generate synchrotron oscillations for oﬀ-momentum particles.

The resultant dynamic aperture for 6 random seeds of machine errors for on-
momentum and δ = 3% oﬀ-momentum particles with the described correction
schemes is shown in Fig. 5. The linear chromaticity was set to zero in this case.
Compared to Fig. 4 (no errors), the dynamic aperture has reduced by about 20-30%.
Since insertion devices were not included in this calculation, this reduction is solely
due to the machine errors and quality of correction procedures described above. As
in the case of the error free lattice, the oﬀ-momentum aperture for machine with
errors is comfortably large. As the Fig. 5 shows, the horizontal dynamic aperture
is in the range of 18 to 20 mm for all particles within δ = ±3% momentum range.
This provides favorable conditions for a long Touschek lifetime and suﬃcient room
for horizontal injection oscillations.

Positive Linear Chromaticity

Though most of this study was done with the linear chromaticity corrected to
zero, in real machines the value of ξ = ∆ν/δ is typically set slightly positive, up to
several units, to avoid eﬀects such as head-tail instability. The main impact of the
positive chromaticity on the dynamic aperture is from the increased tune spread in
the beam. Due to synchrotron oscillations the particles with large momentum errors
would sample a larger area on the tune plane and might cross more harmful betatron

3% (dash) Momentum Oscillations.

resonances. As a result, the momentum aperture can be signiﬁcantly reduced if
the linear chromaticity is too large. The eﬀect on the on-momentum aperture is
typically smaller due only to the increased strength of sextupole correctors.

Fig. 6,7 show dependence of linear chromaticity on the dynamic aperture for
the particles with momentum oscillations of δ = 0, 1% and 3%. The tracking
included a full random set of machine errors, and the chromaticity was set equal
in the x and y planes. Fig. 6,7 show that the particles with momentum errors
of δ = 1% and 3% lose stability at ξ ≈ 15 and 6, respectively. Clearly, this
is the eﬀect of a half integer resonance. For the SPEAR 3 working tune (νx =
14.19, νy = 5.23) the oﬀ-momentum particles would likely be lost when momentum
dependent tune shift approaches to ∆ν ≈ −0.2. The dynamic aperture for the core
beam (low momentum error) is not signiﬁcantly reduced even for the large positive
chromaticity. However, the beam lifetime can be reduced for ξ > 5 due to Touschek
eﬀect, since the scattered particles with large δ may not survive.

Feed-down Studies

Since the electron beam in a SPEAR 3 dipole magnet follows a 10.6◦ arc orbit
with ±16.6 mm sagitta, even the particles traveling along the ideal trajectory will
sample the full set of high order multipole ﬁeld. Taking into account the large

FIGURE 6. Horizontal Dynamic Aperture versus Linear Chromaticity for δ = 0 (solid),

and 3% (dot-dash) Momentum Oscillations.

horizontal excursion of the beam orbit, the dipoles are speciﬁed to have a full
92 mm good ﬁeld region [3]. Since normally the Taylor expansion of the multipole
ﬁeld is speciﬁed around the central magnetic axis, each individual multipole of
this ﬁeld expanded about the curved beam orbit in a dipole will generate (feed-
down) an additional full set of lower order multipoles proportional to the orbit
displacement. Both the nominal and feed-down multipoles have to be combined
to realistically estimate the eﬀect of dipole errors. Though this feed-down eﬀect
might be negligible for large machines, it has to be veriﬁed for smaller machines
with large sagitta in the dipoles.

In LEGO and most other codes, the multipole ﬁeld in a dipole would be expanded
with respect to the ideal orbit, not the magnetic axis. Therefore, when applying
the multipole errors in a dipole, the feed-down terms were included in addition to
the nominal set of multipoles speciﬁed around the magnetic center. Since the feed-
down terms depend on the orbit displacement, we used the following technique to
evaluate this eﬀect. The 1.45 m dipole was ‘sliced’ in a reasonably short pieces and
the average orbit displacement was calculated for each slice. Based on the orbit
displacement in each slice and the nominal set of multipole ﬁelds, the systematic
feed-down terms were calculated for each slice. The tracking simulation was then
done including sliced dipoles with multipole feed-down terms. The results showed
no degradation of the dynamic aperture due to this eﬀect.

Since the sliced dipoles would signiﬁcantly increase the computer time for
element-by-element tracking, normally this model was not used in tracking studies.
However, the magnitude of the nominal dipole multipole ﬁeld used in tracking runs
without explicit feed-down eﬀects was set conservatively large to produce compa-
rable ﬁeld around the orbit.

Large Beta Distortion

In the tracking, typical β distortions caused by the SPEAR 3 speciﬁcation errors
after correction were on the order of ∆β/β = ±(5 − 10)%. However, in a real
machine it is not unusual to observe much larger modulations since some of the
design speciﬁcations may not be achieved, especially during commissioning. The
β distortions lead to a larger beam size and may increase the eﬀects of high order
ﬁeld and resonances.

To verify the eﬀect of large β modulation on the SPEAR 3 dynamic aperture,
the quadrupole errors in two quad families in the matching cells were increased
to the level of a few percent to produce ∆βx/βx ≈ ±30% and ∆βy/βy ≈ ±20%.
The calculated dynamic aperture for 5 seeds of random machine errors is shown
in Fig. 8. The average reduction of the aperture due to this β distortion is about
15% compared to Fig. 5. Though this aperture is still adequate to operate the
machine, it is clear that such large quadrupole errors have to be identiﬁed during
initial operation and corrected.

Orbit Distortion

Large orbit distortions can cause a reduction of dynamic aperture since the elec-
tron beam would experience much larger eﬀects from non-linear sextupole and
multipole ﬁelds. Normally, in this study, the rms orbit was corrected very well,
down to the level of ∼ 100µm. To investigate large orbit eﬀects, an additional set
of magnet alignment errors was introduced in LEGO just prior to tracking. Using
additional uncorrected random alignment errors with σ∆x = 80µm, σ∆y = 40µm,
and 50µrad roll, rms orbit distortions of up to 3 mm in the horizontal and 1.5 mm
in the vertical plane were generated. In each case, the on-energy dynamic aperture
was reduced by a maximum of 2 mm in the horizontal and vertical planes for 6
diﬀerent seeds. The oﬀ-energy aperture was reduced similarly compared to the
oﬀ-energy dynamic aperture without orbit distortions.

For safe machine operation, the peak vertical orbit excursion must be held to
< 1 mm and the horizontal excursion should be < 3 mm, so orbit induced reduction
of dynamic aperture is negligible. Absolute BPM reading errors are expected to
be on the order of a few hundred µm or less. The low sensitivity of the aperture
to orbit distortions should simplify initial injection and machine commissioning at
low currents.

In a related test, we studied large sextupole misalignment while the orbit was
well corrected. The sextupole misalignments generate random quadrupole errors

and result in optics distortion and coupling. To simulate this eﬀect, rms sextupole
misalignments of 1 mm were assigned in both planes, and the orbit was corrected
down to a few hundred µm level. The 1 mm sextupole displacements generate an
order of magnitude larger quadrupole errors compared to the speciﬁed ﬁeld errors
in the ring quadrupoles. Of the 6 seeds studied, 5 cases showed > 17 mm horizontal
dynamic aperture for on-momentum particles. The vertical aperture was always
larger than the ±6 mm ID chamber size. At δ = 3%, the horizontal aperture
remained above 13 mm. The one ’bad’ seed produced 13 mm horizontal dynamic
aperture on-momentum and about the same result for 3% oﬀ-momentum particles.
In practice, with sextupole alignments much better than 1 mm rms, no reduction
of dynamic aperture is expected.

Large Amplitude Coupling

In order to monitor the full extent of the dynamic aperture, the SPEAR 3 tracking
simulations did not include physical apertures. In practice, however, the vacuum
chamber has horizontal and physical apertures that can limit beam lifetime. In the
vertical plane, for example, SPEAR has two insertion devices with y = ±6 mm
vacuum chambers that deﬁne the vertical acceptance. Although the height of the
ID chambers yield acceptable gas scattering lifetime [3], they can limit the Touschek
lifetime if strong coupling is present. In the presence of machine errors and strong
sextupole ﬁelds, for instance, particles with large horizontal amplitudes can reach
resonances which couple the horizontal motion into the vertical plane. This eﬀect
has been observed in operational machines [15].

To study the eﬀect of large amplitude coupling, we launched particles with vari-
able horizontal and synchrotron oscillation amplitudes and monitored the maximum
vertical excursion. Fig. 9 shows the degree of x-y coupling as a function of initial
horizontal amplitude for particles with δ = 0, 1, 2, and 3% energy oscillations. Each
particle was launched with a small initial vertical amplitude of 100µm and the peak
vertical amplitude was monitored for 1024 turns at the ID location. The plot shows
the average value taken over 6 machines with diﬀerent error seeds. Based on these
results, one can conservatively anticipate an eﬀective reduction of horizontal aper-
ture from 20 mm to about 18 mm, and a corresponding reduction in Touschek
lifetime from ≈ 135 hrs to ≈ 125 hrs [3]. The 10 mm injection oscillations in the
horizontal plane should not be eﬀected by this coupling.

Harmonic Sextupoles

The ﬁrst non-linear ﬁeld magnets typically introduced in the optics are sextupoles
which are placed in dispersive regions to correct chromaticity. In addition to their
chromatic eﬀect, sextupoles generate geometric aberrations such as amplitude de-
pendent tune shift and high order resonances. Even without machine errors these

and 3% Momentum Oscillation. Results Averaged over 6 Seeds of Machine Errors.

eﬀects may signiﬁcantly limit dynamic aperture. Therefore, it is important to verify
this limitation and use available techniques to minimize a reduction of aperture.

Though the choice of cell phase advance in the SPEAR 3 arcs helps to reduce
the sextupole geometric aberrations, they are not completely canceled. To further
minimize these eﬀects, additional ‘harmonic’ sextupoles can be used [16]. These
sextupoles are usually placed in non-dispersive regions to avoid their chromatic
eﬀect, and their strengths are optimized to minimize the total amplitude dependent
tune shift. Since this tune shift can be mathematically decomposed into a series of
tune harmonic components generated by sextupoles [16], one technique to reduce
the tune shift is to minimize the strongest harmonic components.

Obviously, the upper limit for dynamic aperture with sextupoles is the aperture
where sextupole aberrations are not present. One way to evaluate this limit is to
track on-momentum particles in the lattice with sextupoles turned oﬀ. The RF
cavities have to be turned oﬀ as well to eliminate any chromatic eﬀects. The result
of this tracking for SPEAR 3 with 6 random seeds of machine errors is shown in
Fig. 10. It follows that if the sextupoles are perfectly compensated the horizontal
aperture could be as large as 28 mm or 40% larger compared to Fig. 5. Realistically,
this limit may not be achieved since all sextupole aberrations have to be canceled
all at once, and even with perfect global compensation the local eﬀects would be
present. Eﬀectiveness of a harmonic sextupole system would also depend on the
phase advance of a particular optics conﬁguration.

Based on formulas in [16], we analyzed the magnitude of harmonic components
in the amplitude dependent tune shift generated by the chromatic sextupoles. The
analysis showed that one of the largest contributions comes from 14th and 18th
horizontal tune harmonics. To minimize these contributions we tested a scheme
which has two family harmonic sextupoles in each of the 14 arc cells. Because of
very limited space in non-dispersive region in the cells, in this test we used thin
lens harmonic sextupoles attached to cell quadrupoles in a doublet. The strength
of these sextupoles was optimized by scanning and maximizing dynamic aperture.
The reduction of tune shift with amplitude due to harmonic sextupoles was veriﬁed
using HARMON and the results are presented in Table 6, where ǫ is the rms beam
emittance. The dynamic aperture calculation with the harmonic sextupoles for
error free lattice and machine with errors is shown in Fig. 11,12. Compared to
Fig. 4, the improvement of error free dynamic aperture is about 10-15%. However,
with machine errors included the improvement of horizontal aperture reduces to
a minimum. Taking into account the cost and design complications associated
with additional sextupoles as well as marginal aperture improvement, the harmonic
sextupole correction was not included in the current design.

Insertion Devices

At present, seven horizontally deﬂecting wigglers are planned in the 3 m drifts
between arc cells. The typical parameters of these insertion devices are: the peak
ﬁeld By up to 2 T, and the total length up to 2.3 m. Though the wiggler magnetic
ﬁeld is highly non-linear, some of its high order eﬀects are locally canceled due to
wiggler periodicity. The remaining lowest order perturbations to the beam optics
are vertical focusing and amplitude-dependent vertical tune shift due to octupole-
like horizontal ﬁeld. In summary, the wiggler eﬀect on dynamic aperture can arise
from perturbation of β functions and tune, high order ﬁeld eﬀects, reduced period-
icity and symmetry of the lattice, as well as wiggler ﬁeld errors and misalignment.

In SPEAR 3 the wiggler perturbation of β functions and phase advance will be
locally corrected using doublet quadrupoles in the cells adjacent to either side of
the wiggler [17]. Tracking studies with seven wigglers showed that without high
order wiggler eﬀects, the corrected wiggler focusing alone does not reduce dynamic
aperture. Without this correction the vertical aperture reduces by about 20%,
though it is still well outside the y = ±6 mm wiggler physical aperture.

The study of wiggler multipole errors was based on recently measured systematic
ﬁeld errors in one of the strongest wigglers (Beamline 11). The measured ﬁeld data
was ﬁt to a set of normal and skew ﬁeld multipoles up to 12th order and used as
wiggler errors in the tracking. Fig. 13 shows that when these systematic multipole
errors are included, the dynamic aperture with seven wigglers reduces by about
10%.

The eﬀects of the non-linear wiggler ﬁeld can further reduce the aperture. Since
these intrinsic high order ﬁelds are in the horizontal plane, they mostly aﬀect
the vertical aperture. Simulation of the ﬁrst two non-linear terms (octupole and
dodecapole-like ﬁeld) showed rather modest reduction of vertical aperture from
11 mm to 9 mm with the above systematic multipole errors included [17]. This
aperture is still well outside the wiggler physical aperture.

Eﬀect of Lattice Periodicity

The advantage of a high periodicity lattice is that the number of resonances
excited by systematic multipole ﬁeld errors is reduced in proportion to the number

reduce the machine periodicity to 2. To verify the eﬀect of periodicity on dynamic
aperture, we tracked particles in a lattice which had only 14 identical arc cells
and compared the results to the aperture of the full lattice. The results for on-
momentum particles are shown in Fig. 14. The two solid curves correspond to
aperture without machine errors, and the dash curves deﬁne the aperture for 6
seeds of machine errors. In both cases the pure 14 periodic cells provide a larger
dynamic aperture compared to the nominal lattice with matching cells. Since
without errors the only non-linear ﬁelds are from sextupoles, one can conclude that
cancellation of systematic sextupole aberrations is much better in a more periodic
lattice. Another observation is that either breaking periodicity or including random
machine errors will reduce the SPEAR 3 aperture to about similar size.

Due to geometric constraints in the existing SPEAR tunnel it was unavoidable to
break the periodicity of arc cells. To keep the eﬀective periodicity of 14, one of the
earliest proposals suggested a I-transformation for the matching cell lattice between
the arcs [12]. However, the matching cells also contribute a signiﬁcant amount of

chromaticity, and it was found that relaxing the matching cell optics improved the
oﬀ-momentum dynamic aperture without compromising the on-momentum aper-
ture.

CONCLUSIONS

A long Touschek lifetime and adequate injection conditions were the primary
motivations to maximize the SPEAR 3 dynamic aperture. The described optimiza-
tion included linear optics, working tune, chromaticity and coupling correction, and
compensation of wiggler focusing. Other potential improvements were analyzed as
well. The eﬀects of large momentum oscillations, realistic machine errors, insertion
devices and larger optics perturbations on dynamic aperture were veriﬁed. The re-
sults consistently showed that the dynamic aperture for up to δ = 3% momentum
errors is not signiﬁcantly aﬀected by these eﬀects. The presented analysis shows
that SPEAR 3 dynamic aperture will provide adequate injection conditions and
result in > 100 hrs of Touschek beam lifetime.

Beamstrahlung monitoring of the beam beam
eﬀects at the Linear Collider

August 2004

At the Linear Collider mismatches between the two beams will
result in an intense beamstrahlung. We have studied how this
beamstrahlung would evolve as a function of the oﬀset between
the two beams and we suggest ways of monitoring it.

1 Beamstrahlung at the Linear Collider.

At the Linear Collider the colliding beams will have a vertical size of less than
a few nanometers. With such a small size any misalignement of the ﬁnal focus
magnets will lead to an oﬀset between the two beams at the interaction point
(IP). As the magnetic ﬁeld in each bunch will be of the order of kilo-Teslas,
the misalignement of the two beams will make that each beam will travel
accross the strong magnetic dipole created by the other and thus produce an
intense synchrotron radiation called, in this case, beamstrahlung [1].

We have used CAIN [2] to evaluate the intensity of the beamstrahlung as
a function of the oﬀset between the two beams. The beam parameters used
are those of the JLC as described [3] but our conclusions are valid for any
linear collider operationg around 500 GeV and would be similar at an energy
of 1 TeV. In this study we have neglected the coherent beamstrahlung (CB)
as the energy of the CB photons is well below the energies discussed below.
The ﬁgure 1 shows the beamstrahlung spot 200 meters away from the IP
for diﬀerent vertical oﬀset between the two beams. As one can see there is a
clear dependance of the beamstrahlung pattern with the beam oﬀset.

Figure 1: Beamstrahlung spot 200 meters away from the IP for diﬀerent beam
oﬀset. For 4 diﬀerent beam beam vertical oﬀsets: (from top to bottom) 0,
0.5, 1 and 10 times the size of the beams. For each oﬀset the leftmost ﬁgure
is the beamstrahlung pattern, the ﬁgure in the middle gives the horizontal
proﬁle of the pattern and the rightmost ﬁgure gives the vertical proﬁle of the
pattern. The four diﬀerent colors correspond to the four energy range (eV,
KeV, MeV and GeV). When the vertical oﬀset changes, the pattern, as well
as its vertical proﬁle change but the horizontal proﬁle remains constant.

The ﬁgure 2 shows the total power per bunch of the beamstrahlung. As
one can see the power also changes with the beams oﬀset. It is also impor-
tant to note on this ﬁgure that at high energy (MeV and above) the beam-
strahlung intensity is higher than the synchrotron radiation generated by
the bending of the electrons during the ﬁnal focusing wheras at lower energy
(KeV and below) the beamstrahlung photons are drowned in a synchrotron
radiation background. A more detailed comparison of the beamstrahlung
and synchrotron radiation spectrums is shown on ﬁgure 3, upper plot.

As the beam oﬀset will have an important inﬂuence on the luminosity
of the Linear Collider, monitoring the beamstrahlung pattern would provide
usefull information on the beam oﬀset.

2 Possible beamstrahlung monitors

One of the main challenge faced by a breamstrahlung monitor will be the
intensity of the beamstrahlung. As one can see on ﬁgure 2, the total energy
of the radiations emitted by each bunch will be of the order of a dizains of
joules per bunch. As there will be more than 10 000 bunch per second the
total power delivered by the beamstrahlung will be a few kilowatts. A con-
ventionnal imaging system would not be able to stand such power and would
be instantly destroyed if it was placed in the beam line. Thus alternative
solutions have to be proposed to monitor the beamstrahlung.

2.1 Using the low energy photons reﬂected by a mirror

The beamstrahlung radiation will absorbed by a water tank. As the walls
of the tank will be made of metal, one can imagine to polish this metal to
make it reﬂective. The reﬂectivity of most metals is low for very high energy
photons whereas it becomes higher for photons of a few eV [4]. Thus the
most energetic part of the spectrum would be absorbed by the water tank
whereas the lower part of the spectrum would be partly reﬂected toward
an imaging device, allowing the observation of the beamstrahlung pattern
in the optical spectrum. One of the challenge faced by this imaging device
would be to extract the variation of the beamstrahlung pattern from the huge
synchrotron radiation background (2 orders of magnitude bigger, see ﬁgure 3,
lower plot). Thus the imaging device would have to be sensitive to intensity
variation of the order of a few percents. To increase the spatial resolution
of the imaging device one could give a spherical shape to the mirror rather
than a ﬂat one, thus increasing the size of the beamstrahlung pattern on the
imaging device.

Figure 4: The walls of the water tank
used to absord the radiations could be
used as a mirror to reﬂect the lower
part of the radiation spectrum.

Figure 5: A Bragg crystal could be used
to select only hard X-rays where the
signal to noise ratio is better.

2.2 Using a Bragg crystal to select thard X-rays

To increase the signal to noise ratio, one may want to select hard X-rays pho-
tons (in the hundreds of KeV range) instead of optical photons. In the KeV
range the signal to noise ratio is slightly better than in the optical range (as
shown on ﬁgure 3, lower plot), thus detecting changes in the beamstrahlung
pattern would be easier.

To select photons in the KeV range a Bragg crystal could be used. This
Bragg crystal would reﬂect photons of diﬀerent wavelength in diﬀerent direc-
tions, thus allowing to easily select only one small energy range as shown on
ﬁgure 5.

The main diﬃculty of this layout is that the Bragg crystal would have to
be inserted directly in the beamstrahlung ﬂux and thus would be exposed to
a very intense radiation (a few kilowatts for a 1mm thick crystal).

2.3

Ionization Chamber

As seen in ﬁgure 2 (top), the total photon energy depends on the beam oﬀ-
set, especially in a case of large oﬀset where the deﬂection angle would be
too small for the fast feedback. An ionization chamber can be a candidate
detector for measurement of the photon ﬂux. The chamber has a 1mm thick
gap ﬁlled with gas such as Helium, whose pressure can be less than 1 atm.
Front plate of the chamber must have enough thickness for absorption of
synchrotron radiations, e.g. a few cm thick copper plate. The area covers
the photon distribution shown in ﬁgure 1, e.g. 20cm diameter at 200m from
IP. The photons convert into electron-positron pairs in the front plate. The

6

electrons and positrons ionize the gas. The ionized electrons are detected at
the back plate with readout electronics. The gap thickness shall be optimized
with drift time. Since typical drift velocity is 4cm/µsec with ∼2kV/cm elec-
tric ﬁeld in the gap, the drift time is estimated to be 40nsec. Since number of
ionized electrons can be 109/bunch in this conﬁguration, no additional am-
pliﬁcation would be necessary. Segmented back plate must be very desired
option for position measurement. The segmentation size of 1cm×1cm seems
to be enough as seen in ﬁgure 1.

Figure 6: An electron wire could scan the radiation beam. Electrons would
be scattered in diﬀerent directions depending on the energy of the photons
the have hit. Electron counters would be used to measure the scattered
electrons’ energy and reconstruct the beam spectrum.

To measure the high energy part of the spectrum without inserting any
device in the beamline, one could try to use an “electron wire” to scan
the beam: a thin beam of medium energy (a few MeV) electrons would
be sent accross the beamstrahlung beam. The electrons of the beam would
be scattered by the photons. The angle with which the electrons would
be scattered would be proportionnal to the photons’ energy. By installing
electrons counters at diﬀerent angles one would be able to measure the photon
beam spectrum at diﬀerent energies. The most forward counters (observing
electrons that have been scattered by highly energetic photons) would observe
almost only the beamstrahlung spectrum. The observed spectrum would
evolve when the beams oﬀset changes.

3 Conclusion

The beamstrahlung radiation generated during the beam crossing at the IP
will carry some information on the beam beam oﬀset. Monitoring the beam-
strahlung pattern would thus allow to extract these information. We have

7

proposed diﬀerent setup that would allow the monitoring of the the beam-
strahlung pattern despite its high power and the high background.

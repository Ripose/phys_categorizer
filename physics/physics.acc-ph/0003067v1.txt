1 Problem

A variant on the electro- or magnetostatic boundary value problem arises in accelerator
physics, where a speciﬁed ﬁeld, say B(0, 0, z), is desired along the z axis. In general there
exist static ﬁelds B(x, y, z) that reduce to the desired ﬁeld on the axis, but the “boundary
condition” B(0, 0, z) is not suﬃcient to insure a unique solution.

For example, ﬁnd a ﬁeld B(x, y, z) that reduces to

B(0, 0, z) = B0 cos kzˆx + B0 sin kzˆy

(1)

on the z axis. In this, the magnetic ﬁeld rotates around the z axis as z advances.

The use of rectangular or cylindrical coordinates leads “naturally” to diﬀerent forms for
B. One 3-dimensional ﬁeld extension of (1) is the so-called helical wiggler [1], which obeys
the auxiliary requirement that the ﬁeld at z + δ be the same as the ﬁeld at z, but rotated
by angle kδ.

2 Solution

2.1 Solution in Rectangular Coordinates

We ﬁrst seek a solution in rectangular coordinates, and expect that separation of variables
will apply. Thus, we consider the form

Bx = f (x)g(y) cos kz,
Bx = F (x)G(y) sin kz,
Bz = A(x)B(y)C(z).

Then

∇ · B = 0 = f ′g cos kx + F G′ sin kx + ABC ′,

where the ′ indicates diﬀerentiation of a function with respect to its argument. Equation (5)
can be integrated to give

ABC = −

The z component of ∇ × B = 0 tells us that

which implies that g and F are constant, say 1. Likewise,

∂Bx

= A′BC = −

f ′′

sin kz,

using (6-7). Thus, f

− k2f = 0, so

f = f1ekx + f2e−kx.

Finally,

so

∂By
∂z

= Gk cos kz =

∂Bz
∂y

= AB ′C =

G′′
k

sin kz,

G = G1eky + G2e−ky.

The “boundary conditions” f (0) = B0 = G(0) are satisﬁed by

f = B0 cosh kx,

G = B0 cosh ky,

which together with (6) leads to the solution

Bx = B0 cosh kx cos kz,
By = B0 cosh ky sin kz,
Bz = −B0 sinh kx sin kz + B0 sinh ky cos kz,

This satisﬁes the last “boundary condition” that Bz(0, 0, z) = 0.

However, this solution does not have helical symmetry.

2.2 Solution in Cylindrical Coordinates

Suppose instead, we look for a solution in cylindrical coordinates (r, θ, z). We again expect
separation of variables, but we seek to enforce the helical symmetry that the ﬁeld at z + δ
be the same as the ﬁeld at z, but rotated by angle kδ. This symmetry implies that the
argument kz should be replaced by kz − θ, and that the ﬁeld has no other θ dependence.

We begin constructing our solution with the hypothesis that

Br = F (r) cos(kz − θ),
Bθ = G(r) sin(kz − θ).

(16)
(17)

To satisfy the condition (1) on the z axis, we ﬁrst transform this to rectangular components,

Bz = F (r) cos(kz − θ) cos θ + G(r) sin(kz − θ) sin θ,
By = −F (r) cos(kz − θ) sin θ + G(r) sin(kz − θ) cos θ,

from which we learn that the “boundary conditions” on F and G are

F (0) = G(0) = B0.

A suitable form for Bz can be obtained from (∇ × B)r = 0:

so

r

∂Bz
∂θ

=

∂Bθ
∂z

= kG cos(kz − θ),

Bz = −krG sin(kz − θ),

which vanishes on the z axis as desired.

From either (∇ × B)θ = 0 or (∇ × B)z = 0 we ﬁnd that

Then, ∇ · B = 0 leads to

F =

d(rG)

− [1 + (kr)2](krG) = 0.

This is the diﬀerential equation for the modiﬁed Bessel function of order 1 [2]. Hence,

The “boundary conditions” (20) require that C = 2B0, so our second solution is

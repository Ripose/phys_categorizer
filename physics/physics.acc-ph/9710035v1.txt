Abstract. In this paper we present the applications of methods from wavelet analysis
to polynomial approximations for a number of accelerator physics problems. In the
general case we have the solution as a multiresolution expansion in the base of com-
pactly supported wavelet basis. The solution is parametrized by the solutions of two
reduced algebraical problems, one is nonlinear and the second is some linear problem,
which is obtained from one of the next wavelet constructions: Fast Wavelet Transform,
Stationary Subdivision Schemes, the method of Connection Coeﬃcients. According to
the orbit method and by using construction from the geometric quantization theory we
construct the symplectic and Poisson structures associated with generalized wavelets
by using metaplectic structure. We consider wavelet approach to the calculations of
Melnikov functions in the theory of homoclinic chaos in perturbed Hamiltonian systems
and for parametrization of Arnold–Weinstein curves in Floer variational approach.

INTRODUCTION.

In this paper we consider the following problems: the calculation of orbital mo-
tion in storage rings, some aspects of symplectic invariant approach to wavelet
computations, Melnikov functions approach in the theory of homoclinic chaos, the
calculation of Arnold-Weinstein curves (periodic loops) in Hamiltonian systems.
The key point in the solution of these problems is the use of the methods of wavelet
analysis, relatively novel set of mathematical methods, which gives us a possibility
to work with well-localized bases in functional spaces and with the general type
of operators (including pseudodiﬀerential) in such bases. Our problem as many
related problems in the framework of our type of approximations of complicated
physical nonlinearities is reduced to the problem of the solving of the systems of dif-
ferential equations with polynomial nonlinearities with or without some constraints.
In this paper we consider as the main example the particle motion in storage rings
in standard approach, which is based on consideration in [1], [2]. Starting from
Hamiltonian, which described classical dynamics in storage rings

and the corresponding expansion of RHS of equations (4).
In the following we
take into account only an arbitrary polynomial (in terms of dynamical variables)
expressions and neglecting all nonpolynomial types of expressions, i.e. we consider
such approximations of RHS, which are not more than polynomial functions in
dynamical variables and arbitrary functions of independent variable s (”time” in
our case, if we consider our system of equations as dynamical problem).

I POLYNOMIAL DYNAMICS

Introduction.

The ﬁrst main part of our consideration is some variational approach to this
problem, which reduces initial problem to the problem of solution of functional
equations at the ﬁrst stage and some algebraical problems at the second stage. We
consider also two private cases of our general construction. In the ﬁrst case (par-
ticular) we have for Riccati equations (particular quadratic approximations) the
solution as a series on shifted Legendre polynomials, which is parameterized by the
solution of reduced algebraical (also Riccati) system of equations. This is only an
example of general construction. In the second case (general polynomial system)
we have the solution in a compactly supported wavelet basis. Multiresolution ex-
pansion is the second main part of our construction. The solution is parameterized
by solutions of two reduced algebraical problems, one as in the ﬁrst case and the
second is some linear problem, which is obtained from one of the next wavelet con-
struction: Fast Wavelet Transform (FWT), Stationary Subdivision Schemes (SSS),
the method of Connection Coeﬃcients (CC).

Variational method.

Our problems may be formulated as the systems of ordinary diﬀerential equations
(i, j = 1, ..., n) with ﬁxed initial conditions xi(0), where fi are

dxi/dt = fi(xj, t),

t

not more than polynomial functions of dynamical variables xj and have arbitrary
dependence of time. Because of time dilation we can consider only next time
1. Let us consider a set of functions Φi(t) = xidyi/dt + fiyi
interval: 0
≤
1
1
and a set of functionals Fi(x) =
0, where yi(t)(yi(0) = 0) are
xiyi |
0 Φi(t)dt
dual variables. It is obvious that the initial system and the system Fi(x) = 0 are
R
equivalent. In the last part we consider the symplectization of this approach. Now
we consider formal expansions for xi, yi:

xi(t) = xi(0) +

yj(t) =

where because of initial conditions we need only ϕk(0) = 0. Then we have the
following reduced algebraical system of equations on the set of unknown coeﬃcients

Its coeﬃcients are µkr =
solve system (6) and determine unknown coeﬃcients from formal expansion (5)
R
we therefore obtain the solution of our initial problem. It should be noted if we
consider only truncated expansion (5) with N terms then we have from (6) the
system of N
n algebraical equations and the degree of this algebraical system
coincides with degree of initial diﬀerential system. So, we have the solution of the
initial nonlinear (polynomial) problem in the form

(7)

xi(t) = xi(0) +

λk
i Xk(t),

N

Xk=1

where coeﬃcients λk
i are roots of the corresponding reduced algebraical problem (6).
Consequently, we have a parametrization of solution of initial problem by solution
of reduced algebraical problem (6). But in general case, when the problem of com-
putations of coeﬃcients of reduced algebraical system (6) is not solved explicitly as
in the quadratic case, which we shall consider below, we have also parametrization
of solution (4) by solution of corresponding problems, which appear when we need
to calculate coeﬃcients of (6). As we shall see, these problems may be explicitly
solved in wavelet approach.

The solutions

Next we consider the construction of explicit time solution for our problem.
The obtained solutions are given in the form (7), where in our ﬁrst case we have
Xk(t) = Qk(t), where Qk(t) are shifted Legendre polynomials and λi
k are roots
In wavelet case Xk(t) correspond to
of reduced quadratic system of equations.

systems. We use for modelling D6,D8,D10 functions and programs RADAU and
DOPRI for testing.

As a result we obtained the explicit time solution (7) of our problem. In compar-
ison with wavelet expansion on the real line which we use now and in calculation
of Galerkin approximation, Melnikov function approach, etc also we need to use
periodized wavelet expansion, i.e. wavelet expansion on ﬁnite interval. Also in the
solution of perturbed system we have some problem with variable coeﬃcients. For

II METAPLECTIC WAVELETS

In this part we continue the application of powerful methods of wavelet analysis
to polynomial approximations of nonlinear accelerator physics problems. In part 1
we considered our main example and general approach for constructing wavelet rep-
resentation for orbital motion in storage rings. But now we need take into account
the Hamiltonian or symplectic structure related with system (4). Therefore, we
need to consider generalized wavelets, which allow us to consider the corresponding
symplectic structures, instead of compactly supported wavelet representation. By
using the orbit method and constructions from the geometric quantization theory
we consider the symplectic and Poisson structures associated with Weyl– Heisen-
berg wavelets by using metaplectic structure and the corresponding polarization.
In the next part we consider applications to construction of Melnikov functions in
the theory of homoclinic chaos in perturbed Hamiltonian systems.

In wavelet analysis the following three concepts are used now: 1). a square inte-
grable representation U of a group G, 2). coherent states over G, 3). the wavelet
transform associated to U.

We have three important particular cases:

a) the aﬃne (ax + b) group, which yields the usual wavelet analysis

[π(b, a)f ](x) =

1
√a

f

x

b
−
a !

 

b). the Weyl-Heisenberg group which leads to the Gabor functions, i.e. coherent
states associated with windowed Fourier transform.

[π(q, p, ϕ)f ](x) = exp(iµ(ϕ

p(x

q))f (x

q)

−

−

−

In both cases time-frequency plane corresponds to the phase space of group repre-
sentation.
c). also, we have the case of bigger group, containing both aﬃne and Weyl-Heisen-
berg group, which interpolate between aﬃne wavelet analysis and windowed Fourier
analysis: aﬃne Weyl–Heisenberg group [13]. But usual representation of it is not
square–integrable and must be modiﬁed: restriction of the representation to a suit-
able quotient space of the group (the associated phase space in that case) restores
square – integrability: GaW H
homogeneous space. Also, we have more general
approach which allows to consider wavelets corresponding to more general groups
and representations [14], [15]. Our goal is applications of these results to problems
of Hamiltonian dynamics and as consequence we need to take into account symplec-
tic nature of our dynamical problem. Also, the symplectic and wavelet structures
must be consistent (this must be resemble the symplectic or Lie-Poisson integrator
theory). We use the point of view of geometric quantization theory (orbit method)
instead of harmonic analysis. Because of this we can consider (a) – (c) analogously.

This is our last private case, but according to our approach we can construct
by using methods of geometric quantization theory many ”symplectic wavelet con-
structions” with corresponding symplectic or Poisson structure on it. Very useful
particular spline–wavelet basis with uniform exponential control on stratiﬁed and
nilpotent Lie groups was considered in [15].

III MELNIKOV FUNCTIONS APPROACH

In this part we continue the application of the methods of wavelet analysis to
polynomial approximations of nolinear accelerator physics problems. Now we con-
sider one problem of nontrivial dynamics related with complicated diﬀerential ge-
ometrical and topological structures of system (4). We give some points of appli-
cations of wavelet methods from the preceding parts to Melnikov approach in the
theory of homoclinic chaos in perturbed Hamiltonian systems.

Routes to Chaos

Now we give some points of our program of understanding routes to chaos in

some Hamiltonian systems in the wavelet approach [3]-[11]. All points are:

1. A model.

2. A computer zoo. The understanding of the computer zoo.

3. A naive Melnikov function approach.

4. A naive wavelet description of (hetero) homoclinic orbits (separatrix) and

quasiperiodic oscillations.

5. Symplectic Melnikov function approach.

6. Splitting of separatrix...
diﬀusion and all that.

3. For ε = 0 we have homoclinic orbit ¯x0(t) to the hyperbolic ﬁxed point x0. For
ε

sally intersection of stable and unstable manifolds W s(Tε) and W u(Tε) in terms of
Melnikov functions M(Θ) for ¯x0(t).

4. If we cannot solve equations (11) explicitly in time, then we use the wavelet
approach from part 1 for the computations of homoclinic (heteroclinic) loops as
the wavelet solutions of system (11). For computations of quasiperiodic Melnikov
functions

IV SYMPLECTIC TOPOLOGY AND WAVELETS

Now we consider another type of wavelet approach which gives us a possibility
to parametrize Arnold–Weinstein curves or closed loops in Hamiltonian systems by
generalized reﬁnement equations or Quadratic Mirror Filters equations.

Wavelet Parametrization in Floer Approach.

Now we consider the generalization of our wavelet variational approach to the
symplectic invariant calculation of closed loops in Hamiltonian systems [16]. We
also have the parametrization of our solution by some reduced algebraical problem
but in contrast to the general case where the solution is parametrized by construc-
tion based on scalar reﬁnement equation, in symplectic case we have parametriza-
tion of the solution by matrix problems – Quadratic Mirror Filters equations [17].

The action functional for loops in the phase space is [16]

F (γ) =

pdq

H(t, γ(t))dt

1

− Z
0
The critical points of F are those loops γ, which solve the Hamiltonian equations
associated with the Hamiltonian H and hence are periodic orbits. By the way, all

Zγ

critical points of F are the saddle points of inﬁnite Morse index, but surprisingly
this approach is very eﬀective. This will be demonstrated using several variational
techniques starting from minimax due to Rabinowitz and ending with Floer ho-
mology. So, (M, ω) is symplectic manifolds, H : M
R, H is Hamiltonian, XH is
unique Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld deﬁned by

where ω is the symplectic structure. A T-periodic solution x(t) of the Hamiltonian
equations

˙x = XH (x)

is a solution, satisfying the boundary conditions x(T ) = x(0), T > 0. Let us
consider the loop space Ω = C ∞(S1, R2n), where S1 = R/Z, of smooth loops in
R2n. Let us deﬁne a function Φ : Ω

where J is quasicomplex structure. We give relations between quasicomplex struc-
ture and wavelets in [11]. But now we use the construction [17] for loop parametriza-
tion. It is based on the theorem about explicit bijection between the Quadratic
Mirror Filters (QMF) and the whole loop group: LG : S1
G. In particular case
we have relation between QMF-systems and measurable functions χ : S1

So, we have the parametrization of periodic orbits (Arnold–Weinstein curves) by
reduced QMF equations.

Abstract

We propose a scheme for generation of single 100 GW 300-as pulse in the X-
ray free electron laser with the use of a few cycles optical pulse from Ti:sapphire
laser system. Femtosecond optical pulse interacts with the electron beam in the
two-period undulator resonant to 800 nm wavelength and produces energy mod-
ulation within a slice of the electron bunch. Following the energy modulator the
electron beam enters the ﬁrst part of the baseline gap-adjustable X-ray undulator
and produces SASE radiation with 100 MW-level power. Due to energy modulation
the frequency is correlated to the longitudinal position within the few-cycle-driven
slice of the SASE radiation pulse. The largest frequency oﬀset corresponds to a
single-spike pulse in the time domain which is conﬁned to one half-oscillation pe-
riod near the central peak electron energy. After the ﬁrst undulator the electron
beam is guided through a magnetic delay which we use to position the X-ray spike
with the largest frequency oﬀset at the ”fresh” part of the electron bunch. After
the chicane the electron beam and the radiation produced in the ﬁrst undulator
enter the second undulator which is resonant with the oﬀset frequency. In the sec-
ond undulator the seed radiation at reference frequency plays no role, and only a
single (300 as duration) spike grows rapidly. The ﬁnal part of the undulator is a
tapered section allowing to achieve maximum output power 100-150 GW in 0.15
nm wavelength range. Attosecond X-ray pulse is naturally synchronized with its
fs optical pulse which reveals unique perspective for pump-probe experiments with
sub-femtosecond resolution.

1 Introduction

Time-resolved experiments are used to monitor time-dependent phenomena. The study
of dynamics in physical systems often requires time resolution beyond the femtosecond
capabilities. Subfemtosecond capabilities are now available in the XUV wavelength range
[1,2]. This is achieved by focusing a fs laser into a gas target creating radiation of high
harmonics of fundamental laser frequency. In principle, table-top ultra-fast X-ray sources
have the right duration to provide us with a view of subatomic transformation processes.
However, their power and photon energy are by far low. There also exists a wide interest
in the extension of attosecond techniques into the 0.1 nm wavelength range.

With the realization of the fourth-generation light sources operating in the X-ray
regime [3,4], new attoscience experiments will become possible. In its initial conﬁguration
the XFEL pulse duration is about 100 fs, which is too long to be suﬃcient for this class
of experiments. The generation of subfemtosecond X-ray pulses is critical to exploring
the ultrafast science at the XFELs. The advent of attosecond X-ray pulses will open a
new ﬁeld of time-resolved studies with unprecedented resolution. X-ray SASE FEL holds
a great promise as a source of radiation for generating high power, single attosecond
pulses. Recently a scheme to achieve pulse duration down to attosecond time scale at the
wavelengths around 0.1 nm has been proposed [5]. It has been shown that by using X-ray
SASE FEL combined with terawatt-level, sub-10-fs Ti:sapphire laser system it will be
possible to produce GW-level X-ray pulses that are reaching 300 attoseconds in duration.
In this scheme an ultrashort laser pulse is used to modulate the energy of electrons within
the femtosecond slice of the electron bunch at laser frequency. Energy-position correlation
in the electron pulse results in spectrum-position correlation in the SASE radiation pulse.
Selection of ultra-short X-ray pulses is achieved by using the monochromator. Such a
scheme for production of single attosecond X-ray pulses would oﬀer the possibility for
pump-probe experiments, since it provides a precise, known and tunable interval between
the laser and X-ray sources.

In this paper we propose a new method allowing to increase output power of attosec-
ond X-ray pulses by two orders of magnitude. It is based on application of sub-10-fs laser
for slice energy modulation of the electron beam, and application ”fresh bunch” tech-
niques for selection of single attosecond pulses with 100 GW-level output power. The
combination of very high peak power (100 GW) and very short pulse (300 as) will open a
vast new range of applications. In particular, we propose visible pump/X-ray probe tech-
nique that would allow time resolution down to subfemtosecond capabilities. Proposed
technique allows to produce intense ultrashort X-ray pulses directly from the XFEL, and
with tight synchronization to the sample excitation laser. Another advantage of the pro-
posed scheme is the possibility to remove the monochromator (and other X-ray optical
elements) between the X-ray undulator and a sample and thus to directly use the probe
attosecond X-ray pulse.

2 High power attosecond facility description

A basic scheme of the high-power attosecond X-ray source is shown in Fig. 1. An ultra-
short laser pulse is used to modulate the energy of electrons within the femtosecond slice
of the electron bunch at laser frequency. The seed laser pulse will be timed to overlap with
the central area of the electron bunch. It serves as a seed for modulator which consists of
a short (a few periods) undulator. Following the energy modulator the beam enters the
baseline (gap-tunable) X-ray undulator. In its simplest conﬁguration the X-ray undulator
consists of an uniform input undulator and nonuniform (tapered) output undulator sepa-
rated by a magnetic chicane (delay). The process of ampliﬁcation of radiation in the input
undulator develops in the same way as in conventional X-ray SASE FEL: ﬂuctuations of
the electron beam current serve as the input signal [6]. When an electron beam traverses
an undulator, it emits radiation at the resonance wavelength λ = λw(1 + K 2/2)/(2γ2).
Here λw is the undulator period, mc2γ is the electron beam energy, and K is the undulator
parameter. In the proposed scheme the laser-driven sinusoidal energy chirp produces a
correlated frequency chirp of the resonant radiation δω/ω ≃ 2δγ/γ.

Our concept of attosecond X-ray facility is based on the use of a few cycle optical
pulse from Ti:sapphire laser system. This optical pulse is used for modulation of the
energy of the electrons within a slice of the electron bunch at a wavelength of 800 nm.
Due to extreme temporal conﬁnement, moderate optical pulse energies of the order of
a few mJ can result in electron energy modulation amplitude higher than 30-40 MeV.
In few-cycle laser ﬁelds high intensities can be ”switched on” nonadiabatically within a
few optical periods. As a result, a central peak electron energy modulation is larger than
other peaks. This relative energy diﬀerence is used for selection of SASE radiation pulses
with a single spike in time domain. Single-spike selection can eﬀectively be achieved when
electron bunch passes through a magnetic delay and output undulator operating at a
shifted frequency. A schematic, illustrating these processes, is shown in Figs. 2 and 3.

Fig. 2. Sketch of high power attosecond X-ray pulse synthezation through frequency chirping
and spectral ﬁltering

Fig. 3. Sketch of principle of ”fresh bunch” technique

The input undulator is a conventional 0.15 nm SASE FEL operating in the high-
gain linear regime. This undulator is long enough (60 m) to reach 100 MW-level output
power (see Fig. 4). After the input undulator the electron beam is guided through a
magnetic delay (chicane). The trajectory of the electron beam in the chicane has the
shape of an isosceles triangle with the base equal to L. The angle adjacent to the base, θ,
is considered to be small. Parameters in our case are: L = 4 m, θ = 1.5 mrad, compaction
factor Lθ2 = 8µm, extra path length Lθ2/2 = 4µm, horizontal oﬀset Lθ/2 = 3 mm. In
the present design we have only 4 µm extra path length for the electron beam, while the
FWHM length of electron bunch is about 50 µm. Calculations of the coherent synchrotron
radiation eﬀects show that this should not be a serious limitation in our case.

Fig. 5. Installation of a magnetic delay in the baseline XFEL undulator. The quadrupole sepa-
ration of a FODO lattice is large enough so that magnetic chicane of length 4 m can be installed

Passing the chicane the electron beam and seed SASE radiation enter the output
undulator operating at an oﬀset frequency. We use a magnetic delay to position the oﬀset
frequency radiation at the ”fresh” part of the electron bunch. This seed single spike at
an oﬀset frequency starts interacting with the new set of electrons, which have no energy
modulation, since they did not participate in the previous interaction with optical laser
pulse (see Fig. 3). This is the essence of the ”fresh bunch” techniques which was introduced
in [7].

In the output undulator seed radiation at reference frequency plays no role. However,
single spike at an oﬀset frequency is exponentially ampliﬁed upon passing through the

Fig. 6. Baseline XFEL undulator allowing diﬀerent modes of operation for SASE FEL. Tuning
of the radiation wavelength and magnetic ﬁeld tapering is provided by changing the gap

ﬁrst (uniform) part of the output undulator. This part is long enough (30 m) to reach
saturation. The power level at saturation is about 20 GW. The most promising way
to extend output power is the method of tapering the magnetic ﬁeld of the undulator.
Tapering consists in slowly reducing the ﬁeld strength of the undulator ﬁeld to preserve the
resonance wavelength as the kinetic energy of the electrons changes. The strong radiation
ﬁeld produces a ponderomotive well which is deep enough to trap the particles. The
radiation produced by these captured particles increases the depth of the ponderomotive
well, and they are eﬀectively decelerated. As a result, much higher power can be achieved
than for the case of a uniform undulator. At the total tapered undulator length of 20 m,
the single-spike power is enhanced by a factor of ﬁve, from 20 GW-level to 100 GW-level.
With the baseline gap-tunable undulator design this option would require only installation
of a magnetic delay. The quadrupole separation of an undulator FODO lattice (5 m) is
large enough so that relatively short (4 m) magnetic chicane can be installed (see Fig.
5). The undulator taper could be simply implemented as a step taper from one undulator
segment to the next. Figure 6 shows the design principle of undulator for attosecond mode
of operation.

Our study shows that the method proposed in this paper allows direct production from
XFEL of single 100 GW-level X-ray pulses with FWHM duration of 300 as. Contrast of
a single spike is mainly deﬁned by the ampliﬁcation of shot noise in the main part of
electron bunch. This eﬀect leads to degradation of contrast of output attosecond X-ray
pulses. However, parameters of the undulator system can be optimized in such a way
that the contrast degradation is insigniﬁcant. Calculation shows that in optimum case
the ratio of the attosecond pulse power (signal) and SASE pulse power (background) at
the undulator exit reaches a value of 400.

3 Generation of 100 GW-level attosecond pulses from XFEL

Operation of 100 GW attosecond SASE FEL is illustrated for the parameters close to
those of the European XFEL operating at the wavelength 0.15 nm [3]. Optimization of the
attosecond SASE FEL has been performed with the three-dimensional, time dependent
code FAST [8] taking into account all physical eﬀects inﬂuencing the SASE FEL operation
(diﬀraction eﬀects, energy spread, emittance, slippage eﬀect, etc.). The parameters of the
electron beam are: energy 15 GeV, charge 1 nC, rms pulse length 25 µm, rms normalized
emittance 1.4 mm-mrad, rms energy spread 1 MeV. Undulator period is 3.65 cm.

The parameters of the seed laser are: wavelength 800 nm, energy in the laser pulse
2–4 mJ, and FWHM pulse duration 5 fs (see Fig. 7). The laser beam is focused onto the
electron beam in a short undulator resonant at the optical wavelength of 800 nm. Optimal
conditions of the focusing correspond to the positioning of the laser beam waist in the
center of the modulator undulator. It is assumed that the phase of laser ﬁeld corresponds to
”cosine” mode (solid line with ϕ = 0, see Fig. 7). Parameters of the modulator undulator
are: period length 50 cm, peak ﬁeld 1.6 T, number of periods 2. The interaction with the
laser light in the undulator produces a time dependent electron energy modulation as it
is shown in Fig. 7. For the laser (FWHM) pulse duration of 5 fs at a laser pulse energy
2-4 mJ, we expect a central peak energy modulation of 30-40 MeV.

SASE undulator consists of three sections. First section is 57 meter long uniform un-
dulator. Second section is 28 meters long uniform undulator with diﬀerent resonance
frequency. Frequency detuning between the second and the ﬁrst undulator section is
∆ω/ω = 0.6%. The third section is 20 meters long tapered undulator. A dispersion section
with 8 µm net compaction factor is placed between the ﬁrst and the second undulator
sections.

Figure 8 shows evolution of energy in the radiation pulse along the undulator. Gener-
ation of powerful attosecond X-ray pulses is performed in three-step procedure. Electron
beam enters the ﬁrst undulator section. Ampliﬁcation process develops from the shot noise
in the electron beam. Figure 9 shows temporal structure of the radiation pulse in the end

ture and spectral structure. A signature of the slice beam modulation is clearly seen in the
temporal structure of the radiation pulse. The dotted line in this ﬁgure shows the initial
energy modulation of the electron beam. The temporal structure of the radiation pulse
has a clear physical explanation. The FEL process is strongly suppressed in the regions of
the electron bunch with large energy chirp, and only regions of the electron bunch with
nearly zero energy chirp produce radiation. From a physical point of view each part of the
bunch near the local extremum of the energy modulation can be considered as an isolated

only a single radiation spike is produced by each area near the local extremum. Note that
each of these spikes (wavepackets) has signiﬁcant frequency oﬀset from the frequency of
the main radiation pulse. For instance, frequency detuning of the spike corresponding to
time t = 165 fs is about 0.5%. It is hardly noticeable on the scale of complete spectrum

tuned to the frequency of the main maximum. Undulator length is 100 m. Plots at bottom show
enlarged view of the top plot. Dotted lines show temporal proﬁle of the radiation pulse before
monochromator

of the radiation pulse, since its contribution to the total radiation energy is a fraction of
a per cent.

At the next step the electron beam passes the dispersion section. The dispersion
section performs two actions. First, it provides delay of the electron bunch by 15 fs with
respect to the radiation pulse, such that the radiation produced by modulated slice of
the electron bunch slips forward to ”fresh”, nonmodulated part of the bunch. Second,
the strength of dispersion section is suﬃcient for suppression of the beam bunching. As
a result, the ampliﬁcation process in the second undulator section starts with ”fresh”
electron beam and radiation seed produced by the ﬁrst undulator section. The undulator
of the second section is tuned to ∆ω/ω = 0.6% in order to provide the resonance with
the radiation produced by the slice of the electron bunch having maximum energy oﬀset.
Under such conditions only a single spike is ampliﬁed eﬀectively as it is illustrated with

plots in Fig. 10. The rest part of the seed radiation pulse has signiﬁcant detuning and
propagates without visible interaction with the electron bunch. Amplitude of a single
attosecond pulse grows exponentially with the undulator length, and enters to saturation
regime with peak power of about 20 GW. In order to increase peak power to 100 GW
level ﬁnal (the third) undulator section is tapered. Bottom plots in Fig. 10 illustrate
typical temporal and spectral structure of the radiation pulse at the exit of the SASE
undulator. In principle, much higher than 100 GW peak power in the attosecond pulse
can be achieved. However, one should keep in mind the background produced by the rest
of the electron bunch. The seed radiation from the ﬁrst undulator section is not a problem,
it has large frequency oﬀset and can be simply ﬁltered by multilayer monochromator. The
main limiting factor is the growth of the radiation from the shot noise which has the same
frequency spectrum as attosecond pulse. When attosecond pulse enters nonlinear stage of
ampliﬁcation, noise background still continues to grow exponentially, and can reach high
power. This eﬀect imposes a limit on the allowable undulator length (and on peak power
of the attosecond pulse). Figure 11 shows temporal characteristics of the radiation pulse
at the exit of the undulator (dotted lines). Solid lines in this plot show properties of the
radiation pulse after monochromator with 0.5% linewidth. It is seen that the contrast of
the radiation pulse is pretty high. Figure 12 illustrates shot-to-shot ﬂuctuations of the
radiation pulse.

4 Pump-probe experiments with attosecond SASE FEL

The proposed high power, ultra-fast X-ray source holds a great promise as a source of
X-ray radiation for such applications as pump-probe experiments. The time resolution of
pump-probe experiment is obviously determined by the duration of the pump as well as

10

Fig. 13. Scheme for femtosecond resolution pump-probe experiments based on the generation of
the 100 GW-level attosecond X-ray pulses directly from X-ray SASE FEL

the resolution of the probing. The pump pulse must always be as short as the desired time
resolution. In typical scheme of a pump-probe experiment the short probe pulse follows
the pump pulse at some speciﬁed delay. The signal recorded by the slow detector then
reﬂects the state of the sample during the brief probing. The experiment must be repeated
many times with diﬀerent delays in order to reconstruct the dynamical process.

We suggest to combine attosecond X-ray pulses with fs optical pulses generated in
the seed Ti:sapphire laser system (see Fig. 13) for pump-probe experiments. In this case
attosecond X-ray pulse is naturally synchronized with its fs optical pulse, and time jitter
is cancelled. Another advantage of the proposed scheme is the possibility to remove all
X-ray optical elements between the X-ray source and a sample and thus to directly use the
probe attosecond X-ray pulse. Usual optical elements are used for seed laser beam splitting
and tunable delay. It should be possible to achieve a timing accuracy close to duration of
the half period of the seed laser pulse (1 fs), allowing an unprecedented insight into the
dynamics of electronic excitations, chemical reactions, and phase transitions of matter,
from atoms, through organic and inorganic molecules, to surface, solids and plasma.

Let us discuss in more detail an attosecond pulse contrast in the proposed scheme for
pump-probe experiments based on the use the direct X-ray beam. We wish to consider one
example which shows the relationship between the signal and background that is easy to
understand. We choose for emphasis here experiments aimed at measuring the lifetime of
electronic excitation. First, the time dependence of electronic occupation is assumed to be
known – this is an exponential dependence n(t) = n0 exp(−t/τ0). The typical lifetime of
electronic excitation is in the femtosecond range. A time-resolved experiment inherently
begins with initiation of the process under study (electronic excitation) at some more
or less accurately deﬁned instant in time. The number of photocounts detected during
attosecond pulse (probe) is directly proportional to the physical parameter (electronic oc-
cupation number) to be measured: K = AIaτan(τ ), where Ia is the intensity of attosecond
pulse, τa is the attosecond pulse duration, and τ is the delay between pump and probe
pulses. On the other hand, the number of background photocounts is proportional to the

integrated value of the physical parameter: K = A

Ib(t)n0 exp(−t/τ0)dt, where Ib(t) is

∞
R
0

instantaneous background intensity of SASE radiation. At time t = 0 the pump pulse

11

perturbs the sample. As a result, the average number of background photocounts is about
hKi ≃ AhIbiτ0n0. The ratio of attosecond intensity and background intensity is about
Ia/Ib ≃ 400. On the other hand, the ratio of attosecond pulse duration and characteristic
time of (sub-10-fs) physical process is about τa/τ0 ≃ 0.1 only. Thus, we ﬁnd that eﬀects
of SASE background radiation are not important in experiments for the study of the
dynamics of the sub-10-fs processes.

It is obvious that proposed pump-probe techniques could be applied at longer time-
scale, too. In particular, there exists a wide interest in the extension of light-triggered
time-resolved studies to the sub-100-fs timescale. Now we return to the question about an
attosecond pulse contrast. According to our discussion above, the number of background
photocounts in this case is proportional to integral over the whole SASE radiation pulse
with duration of about 300 times longer than the attosecond pulse. Calculation shows that
in this case the ratio of attosecond pulse energy to SASE radiation pulse energy reaches a
value of about 1:1. The number of photocounts as a function of delay time has thus a peak
to background of 2 to 1. These sub-100-fs studies we can refer as time-resolved experiments
with the background, as opposed to the background-free time-resolved experiments for
study of the sub-10-fs processes. It should be noted that the ﬁnal time resolution of
pump-probe experiments with the background is not worse than that of background-free
experiments with the same pump and probe pulse duration, but we secure this resolution
with a much higher number of independent measurements.

A scheme of pump-probe experiments for the study of the dynamics of the sub-100-fs
processes can be modiﬁed to increase signiﬁcantly the contrast of output attosecond X-
ray pulses. A reliable method to decrease the background might be to use a broadband
monochromator. One can align the monochromator so that the peak of the SASE radiation
spectrum at reference frequency is blocked. To reach the required value of monochrom-
atization is not a problem. For 0.15 nm wavelength range, Bragg diﬀraction is the main
tool used for such purposes. In this case, one has to care that the short pulse duration is
preserved. We are discussing here only multilayer X-ray mirrors, which have the largest
relative bandwidth [9–11]. Layered synthetic materials – multilayers – are layered struc-
tures with usually two alternating materials: a low and high density materials. They play
an important role in synchrotron X-ray optics. Typical multilayers used as optical ele-
ments at the third generation synchrotrons provide a spectral bandwidth of 0.5 to 5%.
Typical glancing angles are of the order of a degree. As a rule, from 100 to 400 periods par-
ticipate in eﬀective reﬂection in such mirrors. About 90% peak reﬂectivity was achieved
for wavelengths around 0.1 nm. Analysis presented in this paper shows that this tech-
nique has a potential to increase single-spike contrast (ratio of attosecond pulse power to
background power) up to 2000. This means that in the proposed scheme of pump-probe
experiments with multilayer monochromator the eﬀects of SASE background radiation
are not important even in the 100 fs time range.

5 Conclusion

Today there are at least two possible attosecond X-ray sources for light-triggered,
time-resolved experiments associated with the X-ray SASE FEL: the ”attosecond X-ray

12

parasitic” [5] and the ”attosecond X-ray dedicated” source mode proposed in this paper.
The simplest way to obtain attosecond X-ray pulses from XFEL is to use ”parasitic”
technique which is proposed in [5]. It also would oﬀer the possibility of providing a beam
to a pump-probe experiments with the XFEL that has a precise, known and tunable time
interval between the laser and X-ray sources. More power of attosecond pulse could be
obtained using the XFEL for dedicated attosecond X-ray pulse production as described
in this paper.

Both types of attosecond X-ray sources are important, their roles are complementary,
and one type can not replace the other. The baseline gap-tunable XFEL undulator oﬀers
simplicity and ﬂexibility. Diﬀerent operational modes can be realized with the undulator
control system. The baseline XFEL operates in uniform (maximum gain) mode. With
no constraints on baseline FEL operation, technique for production of attosecond X-ray
pulses which is proposed in [5] could be used. If dedicated attosecond beamtime will be
available, an undulator could be tapered (and magnetic chicane could be switched on) to
provide more power in attosecond pulses.

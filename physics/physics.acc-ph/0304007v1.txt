1. In existing projects of electron-positron colliders, the option of polarized electron
and positron beams is considered [1,2]. While one can consider the problem of producing
the polarized electron beams with required characteristics as having been solved [3], the
existing approaches to polarized positrons generation [4-7] do not provide required param-
eters. In quoted papers the schemes were oﬀered, in which by means of various methods
101 MeV is generated to be
a beam of circularly-polarized (CP) photons with energy of
subsequently used for producing the longitudinally polarized positrons during the process
of pair creation in the amorphous converter.

∼

In this paper an alternate approach is discussed - at the ﬁrst stage the unpolarized
positrons are generated by the conventional scheme (interaction of an electron beam with
101 GeV with an amorphous or crystalline converter), which are accelerated
energy of
∼
10 GeV and then interact with intense CP laser radiation.

In the scheme of ”laser cooling” of an electron beam suggested in the paper [8], elec-
trons with energy of 5 GeV in head-on collisions with laser photons lose their energy
practically without scattering. Thus, as a result of a multiple Compton scattering (MCS),
the electron beam ”is decelerated” resulting in some energy distribution, which variance
is determined by the electron energy and laser ﬂash parameters. It is clear that the laser
cooling process will accompany also the interaction of positrons with laser photons.

If we consider unpolarized positron beam as a sum of two fractions of the identical
intensity with opposite signes of 100% longitudinal polarization, its interaction with CP
laser radiation results in diﬀerent Compton eﬀect cross-sections for positrons with opposite
helicity. In other words, positrons polarized in opposite directions lose a various part of
the initial energy, therefore, by means of momentum selection of the resulting beam, it is
possible to get a polarized positron beam with some intensity loss.

With the same accuracy, the cross-sections of spin-ﬂip transitions dσ+−, dσ−+ from
states with opposite polarization signs (ξ0z = +1
ξz = +1)
are equal. It means that the Compton scattering process does not result in considerable
polarization of an unpolarized beam. It should be remarked that the formula (1) is not
the exact invariant expression (as well as formula (12) in paper [9]). Both expressions

may be written in the invariant form with an accuracy of

0 is the classical Thomson cross-section. It is clear that due to inequality
of cross-sections (3), the positrons with various helicities undergo the various number of
collisions, that eventually results in diﬀerence of average energies ¯γ± of both fractions
of the initial unpolarized beam. With this distinction being suﬃciently great, and the
variance of energy distribution for each fraction being enough small, the polarized positron
beam can be generated by means of momentum selection.

4. In paper [13], in considering the MCS process by analogy with passage of charged
particles through a condensed medium, the partial equations are derived that describe
evolution of average energy ¯γ and energy straggling (distributions variance) ∆ for unpo-
larized electron beam passing through an intense laser ﬂash. The approximate analytical

In approximation x

1 the quantity k0 = 2nL σT l corresponds to the mean number of
scattered photons per an electron of the initial beam (in other words, the average number
of collisions of an electron in passing through the ”light” target). When expressing the
photon concentration nL in Gaussian laser beam in terms of Rayleigh length zR and the

The second addend in brackets in (10) can be considered as a correction related to

In the relationship (12), γf is the electron energy after passing a laser ﬂash; the

parameter a2

Thus, the relationship (10) in classical approximation coincides the formula (12), if
one compares the average electron energy γ after the quantum process MCS with the
ﬁnal energy of a particle continuously losing its energy by radiation in travelling along a
spiral trajectory in the ﬁeld of plane electromagnetic wave [15]. For electrons with initial
energy E0 = 5 GeV having passed through a laser ﬂash of following parameters (see[8]):

5. As it was mentioned above, in ultrarelativistic case the diﬀerence between prob-
abilities of spin-ﬂip transitions may be neglected, therefore, in passing the unpolarized
positrons through photon beam, the evolution of each fraction of polarized positrons can
be considered independently.

In this case, the average energy of a fraction and variance may be written in the full

analogy with (4):

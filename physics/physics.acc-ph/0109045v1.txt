Abstract. We present the results of numerical calculations of the channelling and
undulator radiation generated by an ultra-relativistic positron channelling along a
crystal plane, which is periodically bent. The bending might be due either to the
propagation of a transverse acoustic wave through the crystal, or due to the static
strain as it occurs in superlattices. The periodically bent crystal serves as an undulator.
We investigate the dependence of the intensities of both the ordinary channelling
and the undulator radiations on the parameters of the periodically bent channel with
simultaneous account for the dechannelling eﬀect of the positrons. We demonstrate
that there is a range of parameters in which the undulator radiation dominates over
the channelling one and the characteristic frequencies of both types of radiation are
well separated. This result is important, because the undulator radiation can be used
to create a tunable source of X-ray and γ-radiation.

In this Letter we present for the ﬁrst time the results of calculations of the total
spectrum of emitted photons accompanying the channelling process of ultra-relativistic

charged particles through a crystal which is periodically bent. The present consideration
is a further step in investigating new phenomenon which was described recently in
[1, 2] and was called Acoustically Induced Radiation (AIR). It was noted that the
periodic pattern of crystal bendings (which can be achieved either through propagation
of a transverse acoustic wave, AW, or by using static periodically strained crystalline
structures [2, 3]) gives rise to a new mechanism of electromagnetic emission of the
undulator type, in addition to a well-known ordinary channelling radiation [4].

Without any loss of generality further in this Letter we consider the case of a
dynamic periodic bending of a crystal by means of transverse AW, as it is illustrated
in ﬁgure 1. Under the action of the transverse AW propagating along the z-direction,
which deﬁnes the center line of initially straight channel (not plotted in the ﬁgure)
the channel becomes periodically bent. Provided certain conditions are fulﬁlled [2] the
beam of particles, which enters the crystal at a small incident angle with respect to the
curved crystallographic plane, will penetrate through the crystal following the bendings
of its channel. This results in transverse oscillations of the beam particles (additional to
the oscillations inside the channel due to the action of the interplanar force). These
oscillations become an eﬀective source of spontaneous radiation of undulator type
due to the constructive interference of the photons emitted from similar parts of the
trajectory. It was demonstrated [2] that the system “ultra-relativistic charged particle
+ periodically bent crystal” serves as a new type of undulator, and, consequently, as a
new source of undulator radiation of high intensity, monochromaticity and of a particular
pattern of the angular-frequency distribution.

As it was pointed out in [2] this scheme leads, in addition to the spontaneous
radiation, to a possibility to generate stimulated emission, similar to the one known
for a free electron laser [6] in which the periodicity of a trajectory of an ultra-relativistic

3

projectile is achieved by applying spatially periodic magnetic ﬁeld. In connection with
the stimulated AIR it was noted in [2] that to achieve noticeable degree of ampliﬁcation
one has to operate with a positron bunch of a high volume density, which, nevertheless,
turned out to be achievable in modern accelerators as discussed in [5].

≫

The main subject of our previous studies [1, 2] was the characteristics of the
undulator AIR itself. Due to this reason we primarily investigate the case of a high-
amplitude AW, a
d with d standing for the interplanar spacing, propagating through
the crystal. Less attention, except for some qualitative estimates, has been paid to the
detailed investigation of the mutual inﬂuence of two types of radiation, the ordinary
channelling radiation and the AIR, in forming the total spectrum of the radiation
emitted by a channeled positron. This topic is addressed in the present Letter where
we report our ﬁrst quantitative results on numerical calculation of the spectrum of
the emitted photons with both mechanisms taken into account simultaneously. We
demonstrate that there are ranges of (i) the parameters of AW, which are the amplitude,
a, the wavelength λ, and the sound velocity V , (ii) the energies of projectile positron, ε,
(iii) the crystal parameters, which include the length of a crystal, the constituent atoms
and the types of crystallographic planes, inside which

the characteristic frequencies of the AIR and the ordinary channelling radiation are
well separated,
the intensity of AIR is essentially higher than that of the ordinary channelling
radiation,
the radiative spectrum is stable towards the total losses of the particle (in the case
of a positron it is primarily the radiative ones)

These items, except the last one which was considered in [7], are discussed below in

the Letter.

To conclude the introductory part we mention that in the past the problem of
evaluating the total spectrum of radiation formed in a bent crystal was considered in
several publications [8, 9] in the case of a projectile channelling in a crystal bent with a
constant curvature radius. In our Letter for the ﬁrst we investigate the problem for the
periodically bent channel. In full the results of our research will be published elsewhere
[10]. Below we present the essential points.

An adequate approach to the problem of the radiation emission by an ultra-
relativistic particle moving in an external ﬁeld was developed by Baier and Katkov
in the late 1960s [11] and was called “operator quasi-classical method” by the authors.
The details of that formalism can be found in [12, 13]. The advantage of this method
is that it allows to use the classical trajectory for the particle in an external ﬁeld and,
simultaneously, it takes into account the eﬀect of the radiative recoil.

For particles with spin s = 1/2 the energy radiated into a given direction n summed
over the polarizations of the photon and the projectile is given by (the CGS system is

The main advantage of the the quasi-classical approach is that to calculate
the angular-spectral distribution of the radiation one only needs to know the time
dependencies of classical radius-vector r(t) and the velocity v(t) of projectile.
In
connection with a positron channelling through a periodically bent crystal the above
relations impose, if applied directly, some restrictions on the projectile energy, on the
parameters of the crystal (channel) and the AW.

The channelling process in a bent crystal takes place if the centrifugal force in the
channel is less than the maximal force due to the interplanar ﬁeld [14]. For a periodically
bent crystal the maximal centrifugal force is equal to mγv2/Rmin, with v
c and Rmin
being a minimum curvature radius of the bent channel. Hence, the following condition
must be fulﬁlled [1, 2]

≈

mγc2/Rmin < U ′

max.

(2)

where U ′
max stands for the maximum gradient of the interplanar ﬁeld. For an acoustically
bent channel Rmin = (λ/2π)2/a, therefore, the inequality (2) bounds together the
characteristics of the crystal, U ′
max, the AW amplitude and the wavelength, and the
relativistic factor γ. A comprehensive study of the allowed ranges of all parameters
involved in (2) was carried out in [1, 2].

Second requirement which has to be fulﬁlled to make eq. (1) directly applicable to
calculating the spectrum accompanying the channelling process concerns the upper limit
of integration τ , which is related to the crystal length L through L = cτ , and which,
for given value of the AW wavelength, deﬁnes the number of the undulator periods as
N = L/λ. The AIR acquires speciﬁc features of the undulator-type radiation (such as
the monochromaticity and particular pattern of the angular-frequency distribution, see
e.g. [12]) provided N
1. The length of a crystal is subject to a physical condition that
the positron bunch stays inside the channel when penetrating through the crystal on the
scale of L. In reality, the parasitic eﬀect, the dechannelling leads to a decrease in the
volume density of the channeled particles n(z) with penetration distance z, and roughly
satisﬁes the exponential decay law for both straight and bent channels (see [15, 16]),

To evaluate the spectral distribution (1) the following procedure was adopted.
Firstly, the spectrum was calculated for individual trajectories. These were obtained
by solving the relativistic equations of motion with both the interplanar and the
centrifugal potentials taken into account. We used the continuum approximation [20]
to describe the projectile positron – lattice atoms interaction. Within these scheme
we considered two frequently used [15] analytic forms for the interplanar potential,
the harmonic and the Moli`ere potentials calculated at the temperature T = 150 K to
account for the thermal vibrations of the lattice atoms. For each a/d value by changing
the initial values of the entrance coordinate y(0) and the initial velocities along the y-axis
(see ﬁgure 1) we left only those trajectories which corresponded to the case of stable
channelling through the whole crystal length L. We call a trajectory as a “stable” one
if moving along it the particle does not approach crystalline planes at a distance less
than the Thomas-Fermi radius aTF (aTF = 0.194 ˚A for a Si atom). This allowed us
Ld, the random scattering of a projectile
to totally disregard, at least on the scale L
∼
by lattice electrons (see e.g. [15, 16]). Thus, for each a/d value, we deﬁned the ranges

Figures 3 correspond to the spectra (5) obtained as outlined above. The results
presented were calculated by using the Moli`ere approximation for interplanar potential.
The ﬁrst graph in ﬁgure 3 corresponds to the case of zero amplitude AW (the ratio
a/d = 0) and, hence, presents the spectral dependence of the ordinary channelling
radiation only. The asymmetric shape of the calculated ordinary channelling radiation
peak, which is due to the strong anharmonic character of the Moli`ere potential, bears
close resemblance with the experimentally measured spectra [21]. The spectrum starts
at ¯hω
960 keV, reaches its maximum value at 1190 keV, and steeply cuts oﬀ at 1200
keV. This peak corresponds to the radiation into the ﬁrst harmonic of the ordinary
channelling radiation (see e.g.
[22]), and there is almost no radiation into higher
harmonics. The latter fact is consistent with general theory of dipole radiation by
ultra-relativistic particles undergoing quasi-periodic motion (see e.g.
[12]). Dipole
approximation is valid provided the corresponding undulator parameter pc = 2πγ(ac/λc)
is much less than 1. In this relation ac and λc stand for the characteristic scales of,
correspondingly, the amplitude and the wave-length of the quasi-periodic trajectory. For
mγ/U ′′
the channelling motion one can estimate ac as d/2, and λc = cτc, where τc ∼

in the vicinity of the energy of the ﬁrst harmonic. The latter one can estimate as

(see e.g.
which is exactly the calculated maximum value 1190 keV. More accurate estimates (the
details are presented in [10]), based on the account for the dependence of the channeling
oscillation period τc on the amplitude ac of the oscillations, also reproduce the calculated
position and the width of the peak of the channeling radiation.

Increasing the a/d ratio leads to the modiﬁcations in the spectrum of radiation.
The changes which occur manifest themselves via three main features, (i) the lowering
of the ordinary channelling radiation peak, (ii) the gradual increase of the intensity of
undulator radiation due to the crystal bending, (iii) the appearing of additional structure
(the sub-peaks) in the vicinity of the ﬁrst harmonic of the ordinary channelling radiation.
Let us discuss all these features.

The decrease in the intensity of the ordinary channelling radiation with the increase
of the a/d ratio is related to the simple fact that the growth of the AW amplitude leads
to lowering of the allowed maximum value of the channelling oscillations amplitude ac
(this are measured with respect to the centerline of the bent channel) [7]. Indeed, inside
the bent channel the motion of the particle is subject to the action of the eﬀective

where ρ
d/2, d/2] is the (local) distance from the centerline and R(z) is the (local)
curvature radius of the channel. For a channel bent by a transverse harmonic AW
R = [(λ/2π)2/a] sin(2πz/λ). The particle could be trapped into the channelling mode
provided its total energy associated with the transverse motion is less the minimal
value, Uef f (ρ0), of the two maxima points of the asymmetric potential well described
by (6) [7, 16]. The potential Uef f (ρ) reaches the magnitude of Uef f (ρ0) at some point
ρ0 which satisﬁes the condition
< d/2 and the absolute value of ρ0 decreases with
the growth of a. Hence, the larger the channel is bent the lower the allowed values
of the channelling oscillations amplitude are, and, consequently, the less intensive is
the channelling radiation, which is, essentially, proportional to the squared amplitude
[12]. Let us note, that since we have restricted the range of the ac values by imposing
aT F (see the discussion above (5)), then the decrease of the
the condition ac < d/2
intensity of channelling radiation occurs starting with some non-zero value of the AW
amplitude for which

These arguments explain the fact that the intensities of the ordinary channelling
radiation for a/d = 0 and a/d = 1 are much alike, while for a/d > 1 it starts loosing
the magnitude.

The undulator radiation (the AIR) related to the motion of the particle along the
centerline of periodically bent channel is absent in the case of straight channel (the graph
a/d = 0), and is almost invisible for comparatively small amplitudes of the AW (see the
graph for a/d = 1). With a increasing the peaks corresponding to AIR are becoming
more prominent, and for large a values (a/d
10) two additional features appear:
the intensity of the ﬁrst harmonic of the AIR becomes larger than the intensity of the
ordinary channelling radiation, and there appears radiation into the third harmonic of
the AIR.

∼

The positions and the widths of the AIR peaks can be quite accurately estimated as
follows (see [1, 2]): ω(n) = 8πγ2cλ−1 n/(2+p2), where the integer n = 1, 2 . . . enumerates
the harmonics, and p = 2πγ(a/λ) stands for the parameter of the undulator related to
the periodicity of the channel bending. The width of each peak ∆ω = (1/N)(ω(n)/n) is
independent on n. Substituting the values of γ, λ and d indicated above one expresses the
0.05(a/d). Even for the largest considered
undulator parameter via the ratio a/d: p
≈
value a/d = 10 the parameter p is less than 1, thus making the radiation into higher
harmonics of the AIR almost negligible compared with the intensity radiated into the
fundamental harmonic n = 1. The latter is located at ¯hω(1)
90 keV having the width
¯h∆ω
6 keV which is almost 40 times less than the width of the peak of the channeling
radiation. These values depend neither on the ratio a/d = 10 nor on the type of the

As mentioned, all graphs in ﬁgure 3 refer to the forward emission. Therefore, in
[12]), the second
accordance with general theory of the undulator radiation (see e.g.

third harmonic of AIR, and is located at ¯hω(2)

It is important to note that the positions of sharp AIR peaks, their narrow widths,
and the radiated intensity are, practically, insensitive to the choice of the approximation
used to describe the interplanar potential. In addition, provided the condition (2) is
fulﬁlled, the AIR peaks are well separated (in the photon energy scale) from the peaks
of the channeling radiation. Therefore, if being interested in the spectral distribution
of the AIR only, one may disregard the channeling oscillations and to assume that the
projectile moves along the centerline of the bent channel [1, 2]. The above statements are
illustrated by ﬁgure 4 where we compare the results of calculations of the total spectrum
(5) in vicinity of the ﬁrst harmonic of AIR in the case a/d = 10. All parameters are
the same as in ﬁgure 3. The ﬁlled and open circles represent the results of evaluation of
the right-hand sides of (2) and (5) accompanied by numerical solution of the equations
of motion for the projectile within the Moli`ere (ﬁlled circles) and the harmonic (open
circles) approximations for the interplanar potential. The solid line corresponds to the
AIR radiation only (in this case the numerical procedures are simpliﬁed considerably,
leading to the reduction, by orders of magnitude, of the CPU time). It is clearly seen
that the more sophisticated treatment almost does not change the proﬁle of the peak
obtained by means of simple formulae describing purely AIR radiation [1, 2]. Moreover,
the minor changes in the position and the height of the peak can be easily accounted
for within the framework of the cited formalism by introducing the eﬀective undulator
parameter [7, 10] and (in the case of the harmonic approximation) the eﬀective undulator
amplitude [10].

Thus, in vicinity of the AIR peaks there is no coupling of the two mechanisms of
the radiation. On the contrary, the AIR strongly aﬀects the spectrum in the photon
energy range corresponding to the channeling radiation. The discussion of this eﬀect
lies beyond the scope of this Letter and is presented in [10]. Here we only mention that,
as it is clearly seen from the graphs a/d = 6, 8, 10 in ﬁgure 3, for large values of a/d the
peaks of the ordinary channeling radiation acquire additional structure: there appear
sub-peaks separated (in the case of the forward emission) by the interval δω = 2ω(1).

Comparison of diﬀerent approximations used to calculate the total
ardiative spectrum in vicinity of the ﬁrst harmonic of the AIR. The ratio a/d = 10,
other parameters as in ﬁgure 3. See also the commentaries in the text.

The presented results of the numerical calculations of the total spectrum of radiation
formed in an acoustically bent crystal clearly demonstrate the validity of the statement
made in [1, 2, 7] that the AIR and the ordinary channeling radiation occur in essentially
diﬀerent ranges of the emitted photons energies, allowing, thus, to investigate the AIR
properties separately from the ordinary channeling radiation.

The positions of the peaks of the AIR as well as their intensity can be easily varied
by changing the energy of projectile, the crystal type, the type of crystallographic plane,
and the parameters of periodic pattern of crystal bendings. This statement by no means
is restricted to the case of the acoustically bent crystal, but has more general nature.
The treatment and the main results presented above can be applied, in particular, to
consider the undulator radiation in statically bent crystals [2, 3]. Whatever way is
chosen to prepare periodically bent crystalline lattice it is worth investigating, both
theoretically and experimentally, not only the spontaneous emission of the AIR-type,
but the stimulated emission as well [2].

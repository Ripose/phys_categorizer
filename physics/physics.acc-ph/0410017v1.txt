Abstract

Muon Colliders would usher in a new era of scientiﬁc investigation in the ﬁeld
of high energy particle physics. The cooling of muon beams is proving to be the
greatest obstacle in the realization of a Muon Collider. Monte Carlo simulations of
a muon cooling scheme based on Frictional Cooling were performed. Critical issues,
which require further study, relating to the technical feasibility of such a scheme
are identiﬁed. Frictional Cooling, as outlined in this paper, provides suﬃcient six-
dimensional emittance to make luminous collisions possible. It holds exciting potential
in solving the problem of Muon Cooling.

1 Introduction

1.1 Motivation for a Muon Collider

The principal motivation for building a Muon Collider is to extend the high energy frontier
of lepton colliders. With LEP, we likely have reached the maximum energy achievable with
a circular electron collider, i.e., about 100 GeV/beam. The limitation is the energy lost
each turn through synchrotron radiation, which scales as (E/m)4, where E is the energy of
the beam and m is the mass of the particle. A linear electron-positron collider is currently
under consideration which will operate at energies of ≤ 500 GeV per beam. Reaching
these energies requires very high electric ﬁelds as well as very long accelerators. Barring a
breakthrough in acceleration techniques, it is diﬃcult to see how much higher energies will
be possible.

1

A Muon Collider could reach much higher energies in a circular accelerator since mµ ≈
206 me. Collisions between point-like particles would then be possible at energies similar
to those achievable for proton accelerators, thus reopening the energy frontier with lepton
colliders. The physics case for a high energy Muon Collider has been reviewed in many
places. A recent compilation can be found in [1].

A signiﬁcant additional beneﬁt of a Muon Collider would be the intense and well under-
stood ﬂux of neutrinos resulting from muon decays allowing long baseline neutrino oscilla-
tion experiments to be performed with high statistics. The Collider complex could also be
designed in such a way that neutrino scattering physics programs could be pursued. The
physics case for a Neutrino Factory has been studied extensively and detailed accelerator
studies are underway [2]. Low energy muons have a wide range of physics applications [3]
which could also be pursued if the intense muon source required for the Muon Collider were
constructed.

1.2 Diﬃculties

An obvious diﬃculty for the construction of a Muon Collider is the short muon lifetime
(2.2 µs). Muons are not readily available and must be produced with a multi-MW proton
source. Once the muons are produced, they occupy a very large phase space which must
be reduced. The time available for this process is too short for existing techniques to be
applicable (i.e.; stochastic cooling, synchrotron radiation damping rings). A new technique
is required to reduce the muon emittance in a very short time. A related problem is that of
backgrounds resulting from muon decays. Muon decays at all stages of the accelerator com-
plex will produce radiation levels which will pose signiﬁcant challenges for the accelerator
elements. Any detector used to study the muon collisions will also see a large background
ﬂux from upstream muon decays. Of particular importance for a high energy, high current,
muon beam is the radiation hazard resulting from the subsequent neutrino beam, which
cannot be shielded [4].

1.3 Muon Cooling

Many of the diﬃculties listed above could be reduced with very eﬀective muon cooling.
Cooler beams would allow fewer muons for a given luminosity, and thereby reduce the
experimental backgrounds, reduce the radiation from muon decays, reduce the radiation
from neutrino interactions, and allow for smaller apertures in the accelerator elements.
Fewer required muons would also be welcome for the targetry and proton driver, which
provide severe technical and ﬁnancial constraints. We therefore identify the eﬃcient cooling
of the muon beam phase space as the signature challenge for a future Muon Collider.

2 Cooling Schemes

2.1 Overview of a Muon Collider Complex

Before brieﬂy reviewing the proposed muon cooling schemes, we provide an overview of a
possible Muon Collider complex along with beam parameters. Figure 1 shows schematically
the diﬀerent elements required for a Muon Collider. The ﬁrst stage is a proton driver, which
is a high intensity proton accelerator producing several MW of protons in the energy range
2 − 30 GeV (diﬀerent schemes have diﬀerent optimal energies). The protons then impact
a target in a region with a very strong magnetic ﬁeld, and the resulting charged particles,
primarily pions, are captured in a decay channel. The pion drift and decay channel is
optimized to yield a maximum number of muons in the required energy range. The muons
then enter a cooling channel where the phase space of the beam is compressed and they are
then brought to the desired energy in a series of accelerators.

A parameter set for a 3 TeV center-of-mass (CoM) energy Muon Collider is given in [5],
and is summarized in Table 1. The required normalized six-dimensional emittance for this

parameter set is ǫ6,N = 1.7 · 10−10 in units of (πm)3. At the end of the pion drift and decay
channel, the RMS dimensions of the muon cloud in spatial coordinates x, y, z are approx-
imately 0.05, 0.05, 10 m, and in momentum coordinates Px, Py, Pz are 50, 50, 100 MeV/c,
yielding ǫ6,D = 1.7 · 10−4(πm)3. The required emittance reduction is therefore of order 106,
and this reduction must be accomplished with a reasonable eﬃciency.

To reach the luminosities given in Table 1, 0.08 µ per 16 GeV proton must be in the
cooled phase space for each muon charge. If we ﬁx the power of the proton driver at 4 MW,
then we aim for 0.01 muons of each sign per 2 GeV proton, which is our optimal proton

The cooling scheme which has received considerable consideration is Ionization Cool-
ing. We describe this brieﬂy in the next section. The cooling scheme we have chosen to
investigate, Frictional Cooling, is then broadly outlined. The remainder of this paper de-
scribes in more detail a conceptual design for the early stages of a Muon Collider based on
Frictional Cooling. It should be understood as an attempt to ﬁnd a solution to the cooling
problem satisfying physical limitations such as muon lifetime, scattering eﬀects and energy
loss mechanisms. Technical feasibility has not been investigated.

2.2

Ionization Cooling

Ionization Cooling operates at kinetic energies of the order of 100 MeV. For a Muon Col-
lider, emittance reduction would be achieved in alternating steps. First, transverse emit-
tance cooling is achieved by lowering the muon beam energy in high density absorbers
(such as liquid hydrogen) and then reaccelerating the beam to keep the average energy
constant. Both transverse and longitudinal momenta are reduced in the absorbers, but
only the longitudinal momentum is restored by the RF. In this way, transverse cooling can
be achieved up to the limit given by multiple scattering. Second, longitudinal emittance
cooling is achieved by adding dispersion into the muon beam and passing the momentum
gradiented beam through wedge shaped absorbers such that the higher momentum muons
pass through more absorber than the lower momentum muons. This process adds to the
transverse emittance. The steps can then be repeated until the limits from multiple scat-
tering are reached. The trade oﬀ between the transverse and longitudinal cooling portions
is called emittance exchange and the resultant beam is cooled in six dimensions.

Although Ionization Cooling shows promise and has been investigated in detail [6], the
simulation studies have yet to show the required emittance reduction to make a Muon Col-
lider feasible. Various schemes based on Ionization Cooling have achieved six-dimensional
emittance reductions of the order of 100-200 [7].

3 Frictional Cooling

3.1 Basic Idea

The basic idea of Frictional Cooling [8] is to bring the muons into a kinetic energy range,
T , where energy loss per unit path length, ds, increases with kinetic energy. A constant
accelerating force is then applied to the muons resulting in an equilibrium kinetic energy.
A sample 1
ρdT /ds curve is shown in Fig. 2, where it is seen that this condition can be

as a dotted line. An equilibrium kinetic energy, Teq, near 1 keV would result. The nominal
scheme discussed for a Neutrino Factory, based on Ionization Cooling, would cool muons
near T = 200 MeV.

met for kinetic energies below a few keV, or kinetic energies beyond about 200 MeV. At
the high energy end, the change in dT /ds with energy is only logarithmic, whereas it is
approximately proportional to speed at low energies. We focus on the region below the
ionization peak. In this region, ionization is suppressed because the relative speed between
the muon and orbital electrons is too low to allow suﬃcient transfer of kinetic energy for
ionization.

3.2 Some Diﬃculties & Solutions

We study the low energy regime where dT /ds is proportional to the speed v and v ≤ αc,
where α is the ﬁne structure constant. In this energy regime, we imagine applying an electric
ﬁeld which compensates dT /ds, yielding an equilibrium kinetic energy. Several issues are
immediately apparent:

• 1

ρdT /ds is very large in this region of kinetic energy, so we need to work with a
low average density material in order to have a reasonable electric ﬁeld strength,
| ~E|. Eﬃciency considerations lead to the use of a gas rather than a system with
alternating high and low densities, such as foils. We could tolerate larger electric
ﬁelds in a system of foils. However, the foils will give larger energy loss ﬂuctuations,
resulting in problems with µ− capture and muonium (bound state of µ+ and electron)
formation. In addition, a large fraction of the muons would be stopped in the foils
and subsequently lost. We therefore pursue the use of a gas volume with a strong
electric ﬁeld to extract the muons.

• The lifetime of the µ± can be written as

vτ ≈ 0.1qT (eV ) m T ≪ mµc2 .

The muons should therefore only travel tens of centimeters at the low kinetic energies
to have a signiﬁcant survival probability. They must then be reaccelerated quickly to
avoid loss due to decay.

• A strong solenoidal ﬁeld, ~B, will be needed to guide the muons until the beams are
cooled. We cannot have ~E, in the cooling cell, parallel to ~B or the muons will never
get below the peak of the dT /ds curve. The muons will have typical kinetic energies
well above the dT /ds peak when they enter the gas volume. The electric ﬁeld strength
required to balance dT /ds at the low energies would produce a strong acceleration of
the muons at these high initial kinetic energies, such that the muons never slow down.

7

We therefore consider an electric ﬁeld transverse to the magnetic ﬁeld. In the cooling
cell, the force on a muon is given by

~F = q( ~E + ~v × ~B) −

dT
ds

ˆv,

where ˆv is a unit vector in the direction ~v. At the higher energies, the muons follow
the magnetic ﬁeld lines with slow drift and pick up minimal energy from the electric
ﬁeld. Once the muons have slowed down, however, the electric force is no longer
small compared to the magnetic force and the muons will drift out of the volume at a
deﬁnite Lorentz angle. In this way, the cooling cell can be long in the initial direction
of the beam and short in the transverse direction in which the beam is extracted.

• Large electric ﬁelds generally will result in breakdown in gases. Having ~E ⊥ ~B is
expected to avoid this problem by limiting the maximum kinetic energy an ionized
electron can acquire and thus prevent charge multiplication.

• Muonium (Mu) formation (µ+ + Atom → Mu + Atom+) is signiﬁcant at µ+ energies
near the ionization peak.
In fact, the muonium formation cross section dominates
over the electron stripping cross section in all gases except Helium [9]. This leads us
therefore to choose Helium as a stopping medium (at least for µ+).

• For µ−, a possibly fatal problem is the loss of muons resulting from muon capture,
µ− + Atom → µAtom + e−. The cross section for this process has been calculated
up to kinetic energies of about 80 eV [10, 11], at which point the cross section, for
H2 and Helium, is of order 10−17 cm2, and falling rapidly. Cross sections of order
10−21 cm2 are necessary for the cooling described here to have signiﬁcant eﬃciency
for µ−. Large capture cross sections extend to higher T for higher atomic number Z.
To maximize the yield of µ−, we therefore need to use a low Z material and keep the
kinetic energy as high as possible. Helium or Hydrogen appear to be the best choices
for the µ− slowing medium.

• At the low energies used in Frictional Cooling, the question of extracting muons from
any gas cell becomes a signiﬁcant issue. The use of very thin windows as a possible
solution will be discussed in section 7.1.

• Intense ionization from the slowing muons will produce a large number of free charges
which will screen the applied ~E ﬁeld. The speed at which this happens and the extent
of the ﬁeld reduction have not been studied and will require further thought. It is
brieﬂy discussed in section 7.4.

3.3 Outline of a Scheme based on Frictional Cooling

We have investigated the scheme illustrated in Fig. 3. Muons of both signs are produced
by scattering an intense proton beam on a target located in a region with a very strong
solenoidal magnetic ﬁeld (20 T, as in the Neutrino Factory study). A drift region with a
more moderate magnetic ﬁeld, of the order of 5 T, allows the bulk of the pions to decay
to muons. The muons are then input into the cooling channel, which consists of a cooling
cell roughly ∼ 11 m long. The cooling cell contains Helium gas (possibly H2 for µ−), and
an electric ﬁeld perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld. The electric ﬁeld direction is reversed
periodically, as a function of the position along the axis of the gas cell, to cancel the beam
drift. The muons stopped in the cell drift out at a characteristic angle dependent on ~B and
~E. They are then extracted through thin windows and reaccelerated.

At the end of the drift region, there is a correlation between the longitudinal momentum
of the muons and their arrival time. This allows for a phase rotation, where time varying
electric ﬁelds are used to increase the number of muons at lower momenta. In contrast to
schemes based on Ionization Cooling, the phase rotation section follows the cooling cell,
such that those muons already in the low energy regime, which can achieve equilibrium in
the medium, are not lost. In the following, we describe each of these elements and their
simulations in more detail.

4 Simulation of the Collider Front End

The role of the target system for a Muon Collider is analogous to that of a Neutrino Factory.
One needs to generate a maximal number of pions with an intense proton beam and then
capture and guide them into a channel where they can decay to muons. The muons from the
pion decays can then be cooled, reaccelerated and stored in a ring for subsequent injection
into a collider. However, the evaluation criteria for optimizing the pion yield is diﬀerent
for the Neutrino Factory from that of a Muon Collider based on Frictional Cooling. By
virtue of the low energy required for Frictional Cooling, the target system is optimized for
the yield of low energy pions. The starting point was taken from the Feasibility Study II
for the Neutrino Factory [2]. We then modiﬁed the design to ﬁt our needs.

The following target yield studies were performed using the MARS Monte Carlo code [12].
MARS performs fast, inclusive simulations of three-dimensional hadronic and electromag-
netic cascades, and performs muon and low energy neutron transport in material, in the
energy range of a fraction of an eV up to 30 TeV. The subsequent transport of produced
particles in the target area and decay channel was simulated using the GEANT 3.21 pack-
age [13]. The cooling and reacceleration simulation was performed with custom written
code.

4.1 Targetry

The initial target geometry studied consisted of the Study II [2] target, in which the proton
beam impinged a target under a small angle. A strong solenoidal ﬁeld is used to capture
pions in a wide phase space. The extraction of the pion beam takes place in the longitudinal
direction (the direction of the incident proton beam) in the Neutrino Factory scheme.

This is not ideal for Frictional Cooling because the highest momentum muons, which
result from decays of the highest momentum pions, would not be cooled. Frictional Cooling
requires the optimization of the pion yield at low energies. Figure 4 shows the signed kinetic
energy of the produced π± from the target. The z-direction is the longitudinal or proton
beam direction. The low energy pion yield transverse to the target is larger than that in
the longitudinal direction. Moreover, there are relatively equal yields for π+ and π−. This
allows the possibility to develop a symmetric µ+ and µ− machine and hence cool both signs
at the same time. We have therefore chosen to extract the pions produced transverse to the
target. The magnetic ﬁeld is therefore perpendicular to the direction of the proton beam.

as Px,y,z
|Px,y,z|Tx,y,z. The shaded histograms correspond to those pions with a kinetic energy
11
less than 100 MeV. The vertical scale is arbitrary. The numbers on the plots indicate the
number of pions per 1 GeV proton on target within the shaded regions.

4.1.1 Layout of Target Area

The pion capture mechanism consists of a solenoidal magnetic ﬁeld channel starting with
B=20 T near the target and falling adiabatically to 5 T at 18 m. Particle capture/extraction
takes place transverse to the target or direction deﬁned by the proton beam.

The magnetic ﬁeld is symmetric with a gap for the non-interacting proton beam, and
forward produced particles, to pass through. Figure 5 shows the dimensions of the solenoid
coils and magnetic ﬁeld proﬁle. Note that the z-direction is redeﬁned in this ﬁgure to the
direction of extraction which is transverse to the target. The proton beam trajectory in
this strong ﬁeld has not been simulated in detail.

4.1.2 Optimization of Yields

An optimization of the composition and geometry of the target was performed to ﬁnd the
maximal pion yield, which would produce coolable muons. Coolable muons were deﬁned
as those with a kinetic energy less than 120 MeV. The target material, geometry and the
energy of the proton driver, were varied to ﬁnd the optimum yield. The results of this study
are summarized in Fig. 6.

The choice of a Copper target resulted in the optimal yield. A Tungsten target produced

similar performance and may be more desirable in terms of stability and target lifetime.

Figure 7 shows the eﬀect of the proton driver beam energy on the yield for various target
species and thicknesses. A proton beam energy of 2 GeV results in the highest yield and
roughly equal yield for both signs of pions. This is important in the development of a µ+µ−
collider.

4.2 Drift Region

The solenoidal ﬁeld is tapered down from 20 T at the target to 5 T in order to reduce the
amount of stored energy of such a section and to reduce cost. We have used a similar design
to that given in [2]. The length over which the pion beams are allowed to drift and decay
was then optimized (for the muon yield). Figure 8 shows the results of this study. The
optimum drift length is taken to be the distance which gives the maximum µ+/p yield for
Tµ+ < 120 MeV and is found to be 28 m.

4.3 Summary of Target and Drift regions

In summary, the optimization of the front end of a muon Frictional Cooling scheme resulted
in the following scenario:

solenoids used to create the tapered solenoidal ﬁeld. The lower plot shows the contribu-
tions from individual solenoids and their cumulative ﬁeld along the z axis. The target is

The yield at the end of the drift of such a front end is 0.062 µ+ per 2 GeV proton and
0.054 µ− per 2 GeV proton.

4.4 Phase Rotation Section

At the end of the cooling cell, there is a correlation between the longitudinal momentum
of the muons which survive and the arrival time. This allows for a phase rotation to take
place, where time varying electric ﬁelds are used to increase the number of muons at lower
momenta. A simple ansatz was used for the phase rotation section and consisted of a ﬂat
5 MV/m ﬁeld for some time t1, after which the ﬁeld went linearly to zero at a time t2.
These parameters were optimized (t1 = 100 ns and t2 = 439 ns) to obtain the maximum
number of muons/proton coming from the front end. The eﬀect of the phase rotation on
the kinetic energy distribution of the muons is shown in Fig. 9.

5 Cooling Cell

The simulated cooling cell is a cylinder ﬁlled with either Helium (for µ+ or µ−) or Hydrogen
(for µ−) gas. The axis of the cylinder deﬁnes the z-direction (or longitudinal direction) and
corresponds to the direction of the muon beam. The entrance windows at either end must
pass T ≤ 50 MeV muons with high eﬃciency. The extracted muons come out transversely
and have low energy. The windows for the transverse extraction must have high eﬃciency
for T ≤ 1 keV muons.

The gas cell consists of one continuous volume, 11 m in length. The cell is located
immediately after the drift region to capture those muons which are already slow enough to
be stopped in 11 m of gas. The bulk of the muons at higher energies pass unaﬀected through
the gas cell into the phase rotation section. The phase rotation reﬂects the beam using time
changing electric ﬁelds and is optimized to produce a maximum number of muons at low
kinetic energies such that they can be stopped in the gas cell.

The density of Helium used in the simulation for µ+ was 1.25 · 10−4 g/cm3, which
corresponds to roughly 0.7 atm at STP. For µ−, 0.3 atm of He or H2 was used, which
correspond to densities of 5.35 · 10−5 and 2.5 · 10−5 g/cm3 respectively.

The window thicknesses for the extraction of low energy muons varied from 0-20 nm
of Carbon. These windows are conceived as grids upon which a Carbon ﬁlm is deposited.

The grid would have a large open area (> 80%), and this loss in eﬃciency has not been
simulated.

The entire cooling and phase rotation sections were contained inside a uniform 5 T
solenoidal ﬁeld and the crossed electric ﬁeld strength was taken to be 5 MV/m inside the
gas cell section. The electric ﬁeld oscillated as a cosine function every 30 cm inside the gas
cell and was exponentially damped to zero at a radius 70 cm. The Ex ﬁeld proﬁle is deﬁned
as follows,

Ex = E0 · cos(z[cm]π/30.) · (1 − exp(−(|y[cm]| − 70)/20)),

and can be seen in Fig. 10. The technical feasibility of such a ﬁeld conﬁguration has not
yet been investigated.

5.1 Tracking

The physics processes are described in more detail in the next section - we focus here on
the technical aspects of the tracking. Muon decay and muon capture were not simulated
but were taken into account by calculating the probability that the muons survived these
processes.

The tracking of muons proceeded as follows:

• The position of the muon was used to determine the local value of the electric and

magnetic ﬁelds, as well as the local material and density.

• Given the muon momentum and the medium in which it was located, the mean free
path to the next nuclear scatter was calculated. The mean free path was then used
to generate a track step, D.

• D was then compared to the maximum step size, d, (typically 10 µm), set to preserve
accuracy in tracking. If D > d then D was broken up into several steps of size ≤ d.

• The Runge-Kutta-Merson approach was then used to update the position and mo-
mentum of the muon according to the Lorentz force equation for each step using the
CERN routine [14] DDEQMR. The force law included the continuous energy loss from
scattering on electrons via:

~F =

= q ~E + q~v × ~B −

d ~P
dt

dT
ds

ˆv,

where T is the muon kinetic energy and s is the path length. The total time was
updated at each step, and the time interval in the step was used to update the decay
survival probability. For negative muons, the capture survival probability was also
updated based on the step length and kinetic energy.

• Once the full distance D was reached, a scattering angle was generated according to
the relevant diﬀerential cross section. The momentum components of the muon were
then updated appropriately.

This procedure was followed until either the muon left the cooling cell volume or one of the
survival probabilities fell below 0.001. The tracking code was tested extensively and was
found to give very accurate results. Examples of muon trajectories are given in section 5.2.

5.1.1 Simulation of Physics Processes

Frictional Cooling cools muon beams to the limit of nuclear scattering. A detailed simu-
lation was therefore performed where all large angle nuclear scatters were simulated. The
diﬀerential distributions and mean free paths for µ-nucleus scattering were calculated in
two diﬀerent ways depending on the energy regime. A quantum mechanical (Born Ap-
proximation) calculation was used for the scattering cross section at high kinetic energies
(Tµ > 2 keV) and a classical calculation was used at lower kinetic energies. The screened
Coulomb potential used in the Born and classical calculations had the form

V =

exp(

4e2
r

−r
a

),

where a is the screening length. For the classical calculation the procedure of Everhart et
al. [15] was followed. The diﬀerential cross section was calculated by scanning in impact
parameter and evaluating the scattering angle at each impact parameter. From the diﬀer-
ential cross section, a mean free path for scattering angles greater than a cutoﬀ (0.05 rad)
was found, and scatters were then generated according to the diﬀerential cross section. This
method reproduces the energy loss from nuclear scatters tabulated by NIST [16] for protons.
The simulation results for µ+ and µ− are shown in Fig. 11. For µ+, the electronic energy
loss is taken from the NIST tables. The suppression for µ− (Barkas eﬀect [17]) was param-
eterized from the results in [18]. The electronic energy loss was treated as a continuous
process. The electronic energy losses for µ+ and µ− are shown in Fig. 12. This diﬀerence
is signiﬁcant below the ionization peak, which is expected to be due in part to muonium
formation.

To simulate the eﬀect of muonium formation in the tracking, an eﬀective charge was
used, as given by σI/(σF + σI), where σI is the cross section for muonium ionization and
σF is the cross section for muonium formation (see Fig. 13).

Negative muon capture was parameterized from calculations of Cohen [10, 11] and in-
cluded in our simulation. The calculations only extend up to 80 eV. Beyond this, a simple
exponential fall oﬀ with kinetic energy was assumed. The parameterization is plotted in
Fig. 14.

5.2 Trajectories

The momentum and space distributions of muons at the end of the decay channel are
displayed in Fig. 15 and Fig. 16. The full histograms show the input distributions, while the
shaded histograms show the distributions of muons which survive. From these distributions,
one can see that this cooling channel does not cool muons with a momentum greater than
200 MeV/c. In the absence of electric and magnetic ﬁelds the range, in meters, for a µ+ in
He gas with density ρ = 1 · 10−4 gm/cm3 was found to be

R [m] = 1.2 · 10−4(| ~P | [MeV/c])3.35,

with the momentum given in units of (MeV/c). The cooling cell has a length of 11 m. Due
to the transverse momentum of the muon, the total path length in the cell is on average
20 m. Therefore, muons with ~P ≤ 35 MeV/c will be stopped in the gas cell. This can
either happen on the ﬁrst pass (ﬁrst peak in Fig. 15), or after the phase rotation/reﬂection
(second and third peaks in Fig. 15). For the maximum momentum, muons require about
300 ns to reach the equilibrium energy, Teq. The time required to drift transversely out of
the cell depends on where the muon reached Teq. Taking as nominal values Teq = 500 eV

velocity and t is absolute time.

and a drift distance of 20 cm (cell radius) yields an additional time of 200 ns. Additional
ﬂight times appear for the muons which are reﬂected by the phase rotation section and in
the initial reacceleration (described below). The time required for cooling the muons and
extracting them is therefore of order 1 µs.

We now describe example muon trajectories in diﬀerent sections of the cooling cell. In
Fig. 17, the path of a muon with initial momenta: Px = 1 MeV/c, Py = 0 MeV/c and
Pz = 100 MeV/c is shown in the yz and xy views. In the yz view, the slow drift of the

muon in the cooling cell with initial momenta: Px = 1 MeV, Py = 0 MeV and Pz = 100 MeV.

muon in the y direction resulting from the ~E ⊥ ~B ﬁeld is evident. Also, the radius of the
trajectory is decreasing due to the energy loss in the gas. Once the muon has reached the
equilibrium energy, it is extracted from the cell at a ﬁxed Lorentz angle, which is clearly
seen in the x-y plane view. The eﬀect of the large angle nuclear scatters is visible. The eﬀect
on the kinetic energy of the muon is shown in Fig. 18, where the kinetic energy is plotted
as a function of time. The large oscillations in kinetic energy depend very strongly on the
scattering angle. In some cases, the muon bounces oﬀ a nucleus in a direction opposite to the
accelerating force. In this case, a muon can come almost to rest before it is reaccelerated.
This is a particularly dangerous situation for µ−, since the capture probability increases
rapidly at the smaller kinetic energies as shown in Fig. 14.

The muons can drift either in the positive-x or negative-x direction depending on the

reaches the edge of the cooling cell, it is extracted through a thin window and enters a
completely evacuated region.

6 Acceleration and Bunching

6.1

Initial Reacceleration

Upon leaving the cooling cell, the extracted muons undergo cycloid motion with net direc-
tion of motion along the positive or negative-y direction. The parameters of the cycloid
change adiabatically with the changing electric ﬁeld as a function of y. For |y| > 30 cm,
an electric ﬁeld component in the z-direction is also present,as shown in Fig. 19, so that
muons are then accelerated along the z-axis. This electric ﬁeld is relatively weak in order to
avoid inducing too large a momentum spread in the beam at the end of the 11 m section.
The value of the z-coordinate at which muons are extracted from the gas cell is plotted
in Fig. 20. The distribution is rather ﬂat, so that muons will have a relatively ﬂat kinetic
energy spectrum at the end of the 11 m cell between 0 and 0.11 MeV.

The ﬁnal beam position after this reacceleration is shown in Fig. 21. The muon beam
has an arithmetic mean energy of ∼ 427 keV and a root mean square of ∼ 306 keV. The
time spread of the beam coming out of this initial reacceleration is shown in Fig. 22 and
has a root mean square of 1 µs.

The beam coming out of the initial reacceleration region must continue to be rapidly
accelerated and, most importantly, the time spread reduced. Fig. 23 shows the results of a
preliminary reacceleration. The eﬀect on the time distribution is signiﬁcant as the RMS of
the time distribution goes from 1 µs to 3 ns whilst the momentum RMS spread increases
from 1.2 MeV/c to 5 MeV/c at a ﬁnal mean momentum of 147 MeV/c. The survival rate
for this reacceleration is 30%.

6.2 Phase Space Reduction

The six-dimensional normalized emittance is calculated as follows:

ǫ6D,N =

σxσyσzσpxσpyσpz
(π mµc)3

,

where the σ’s are RMS values of the transverse and longitudinal components of the muon
beam. The emittance is evaluated at a given z position of the beam and thus the σz is
calculated using σβct at a given z. In calculating the emittance no correlations are taken
into account between the distributions. The total phase space reduction is calculated by

6D,N , emittances of the muon
beam. The initial emittance is calculated using the initial distributions of those muons
which are successfully cooled. Another method would be to take the emittance calculated
using all the muons at the end of the drift. However, there is an acceptance limitation for
this channel - the channel cannot accept the entire beam produced by the front end of this
scheme. This is evident since the initial emittance, calculated from the beam components
given in Table 2, is smaller than the emittance of the entire muon beam at the end of the
drift. This indicates that any pre-cooling channel which cools the beam by one order of
magnitude could then be followed by such a frictional cooling channel and hence increase
the yield of the entire scheme.

The results for the simulated scheme outlined in this report are listed in Tables 2 and 3.

The yield for this scheme is 0.0021 µ+ per 2 GeV proton. This yield does not change
greatly for window thicknesses up to 20 nm. As a consequence of the alternating transverse
electric ﬁeld there are two beamlets emerging. The question of the ﬁnal emittance of
the total beam after recombining the beamlets is left open. Averaging their emittances
or at worst adding them together would still result in a beam of suﬃcient emittance for

luminous collisions. The total phase space reduction, depending on how one combines the
beamlets, ranges from 1 · 10−5 to 3 · 10−5. This scheme produces a cool muon beam with
ǫ6D,N ∼ 2 · 10−11 (π m)3. This should be compared to 1.7 · 10−10 (π m)3 from Table 1,
which is the minimum emittance for luminous collisions at a Muon Collider. The Frictional
Cooling scheme outlined in this paper is an order of magnitude better than this benchmark.
The yield is a factor of 5 lower than hoped but is compensated by the reduced emittance.
Although earlier studies [19] have shown similar promising results for µ−, this scheme

has not been fully evaluated for µ−.

There is still room for improvement. For example, the electric ﬁeld conﬁguration is
smoothly oscillating to make it more realistic but it is far from optimal. Parameters,
such as the length of the cell and strength of the initial reacceleration can still be tuned
together to achieve better performance. Nonetheless, the ingredients for successful phase
space reduction of muon beams are there.

7 Issues for Future Studies

This paper is meant to outline a possible phase space reduction scheme for a muon beam
intended for a Muon Collider. Amongst the improvements and reﬁnements of the scheme,
there are several issues which require further thought and eventually experimental proof of
principle.

7.1 Windows

The windows must be thin, gas tight and, eventually, made larger in area than currently
available.

A Frictional Cooling demonstration experiment using protons [20] was performed at
Nevis Laboratories. The experiment used thin windows which were 20 nm Carbon on a
thin Nickel grid, as quoted from the manufacturer. However, the data indicated an eﬀective
thickness which was more than an order of magnitude larger than what was expected,
resulting in all protons which achieved the equilibrium being stopped in the exit window.
This complication further emphasizes the importance of the window issue.

7.2 Muon Capture

The capture cross section of the µ− by He or H2 gas, at energies below 1 keV, is experimen-
tally unknown. Theoretical calculations were incorporated in the simulation programs but

37

it remains an experimental issue for this scheme. We anticipate performing an experiment
to directly measure this capture cross section.

7.3 Electrical breakdown

Most accelerating structures in particle accelerators (RF cavities etc.) operate in as good
a vacuum as possible to avoid electrical breakdown. Conversely, breakdown can also be
suppressed by using dense materials between electrodes. In this case, the mean free path
between collisions for free ions is so small that the ions cannot accelerate to high enough
energies to create an avalanche. The Paschen law [21] deﬁnes the breakdown voltage in gases
as a function of pressure and distance. For 1 atm of Helium, the electric ﬁeld achievable
before breakdown is less than ∼ 0.5 MV/m. This is an order of magnitude less than what
has been considered in the Frictional Cooling cell. However, in a crossed ~E and ~B ﬁeld, a
charged particle experiences cycloid motion resulting in a maximum kinetic energy deﬁned
by Tmax = 2m(| ~E|/| ~B|)2, where m is the mass of the charged particle. Hence, the maximum
kinetic energy that can be achieved by an ionized electron for | ~B| = 5 T and | ~E| = 5 MV/m
is 11.4 eV. This is below the ionization energy of both Helium and Hydrogen (25.4 eV and
13.6 eV respectively) and hence an ionized electron would not create an electrical breakdown
in the gas. It should therefore be possible to suppress multiplication in our cooling cell.

7.4 Plasma Formation and Charge screening
The crossed ~E and ~B ﬁelds may allow the bounds from the Paschen Curves to be avoided
but there is still a large amount of energy being deposited into the gas cell which will create
a large number of free ions. The danger is not that avalanche and breakdown will occur but
rather that the separation of the free charges may screen or at worst cancel the imposed
electric ﬁeld.

To meet the ﬁnal luminosity requirements, of order 5 · 1012 muons per pulse will have
to be stopped in the gas cell, with a mean initial kinetic energy of 10 MeV. Taking an
ionization energy of 25 eV for Helium, we ﬁnd 2 · 1018 ionized electrons. This is a large
number of electrons and ions, which will drift apart in the crossed electric and magnetic
ﬁeld, tending to screen the ﬁeld. The speed at which this occurs, and the eﬀect on the
extraction of the muons, will clearly need careful evaluation.

38

8 Summary and Conclusions

A Muon Collider would be extremely valuable to the ﬁeld of High Energy Physics, leading to
a new era of precision investigation whilst opening up the high energy frontier for discovery.
Any Muon Collider will require an eﬃcient and eﬀective cooling scheme for muons.

The scheme described here is based on the concept of Frictional Cooling. To that end
simulations have been performed to evaluate Frictional Cooling as well as the components
required upstream of the cooling module, such as the proton driver. We propose a 2 GeV
proton beam impinging of a Copper target as the front end. By capturing the low energy
pion cloud transverse to the target, relatively equal yields of both π+ and π− are produced.
This allows the development of a symmetric machine. The ﬁnal six-dimensional emittance
coming out of the cooling section is 2·10−11 (π m)3, which is better than the target emittance
in various parameters sets of potential Muon Colliders. The yield for this scheme, as it was
simulated for this study, is 0.0021 µ+/2 GeV proton. This is somewhat low but there
is potential for improvement. A rapid reacceleration of the muon beam has also been
developed and takes the cool muon beam to a mean momentum of 147 MeV/c with a
survival probability of 30%. The simulation code has been experimentally supported by
data from a Frictional Cooling experiment with protons [20] and more experiments are
planned to further test the Monte Carlo.

The results outlined in this paper show that a muon beam of suﬃciently small emittance
for luminous collisions can be produced. The steps from production, cooling and reaccel-
eration have been addressed and a series of critical issues have also been outlined for this
scheme to be further developed. At this stage the results are encouraging and Frictional
Cooling continues to be an exciting alternative potential for the successful phase space
reduction of muon beams intended for a Muon Collider.

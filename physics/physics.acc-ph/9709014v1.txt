THE ALGEBRAIC RECONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUE (ART)∗

Abstract

Projections of charged particle beam current density (pro-
ﬁles) are frequently used as a measure of beam position and
size. In conventional practice only two projections, usually
horizontal and vertical, are measured. This puts a severe
limit on the detail of information that can be achieved. A
third projection provides a signiﬁcant improvement. The
Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART) uses three or
more projections to reconstruct 3-dimensional density pro-
ﬁles. At the 200 MeV H- linac, we have used this tech-
nique to measure beam density, and it has proved very help-
ful, especially in helping determine if there is any coupling
present in x-y phase space. We will present examples of
measurements of current densities using this technique.

INTRODUCTION

In Computed Tomography (CT), three dimensional recon-
struction techniques from projection have been used for
many years in radiology. The two dimensional Fourier
transform is the most commonly used algorithm in radiol-
ogy. In this technique a large number of projections at uni-
formly distributed angles around the subject are required
for reconstruction of the image. In the ﬁeld of accelerator
physics, one expects that the relatively simple charged par-
ticle beam distributions can be reconstructed from a small
number of projections. In conventional practice only two
projections, usually horizontal and vertical, are measured.
This puts a severe limit on the level of detail that can be
achieved. The Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART)
introduced by Gordan, Bender and Herman [1] uses three
or more projections to reconstruct the 2-dimensional beam
density distribution. They have shown that the improve-
ment in the quality of the reconstruction is pronounced
when a third projection is added, but additional projections
add much less to the reconstruction quality.

2 ALGEBRAIC RECONSTRUCTION

TECHNIQUE (ART)

The ART algorithms have a simple intuitive basis. Each
projected density is thrown back across the reconstruc-
tion space in which the densities are iteratively modiﬁed
to bring each reconstructed projection into agreement with
the measured projection. Assuming that the pattern being
reconstructed is enclosed in a square space of n x n ar-
j = 1, . . . , n2
ray of small pixels, ρj
is grayness or den-
sity number, which is uniform within the pixel but differ-

ergy.

ent from other pixels. A “ray” is a region of the square
space which lies between two parallel lines. The weighted
ray sum is the total grayness of the reconstruction ﬁgure
within the ray. The projection at a given angle is then the
sum of non-overlapping, equally wide rays covering the
ﬁgure. The ART algorithm consists of altering the gray-
ness of each pixel intersected by the ray in such a way as
to make the ray sum agree with the corresponding element
of the measured projection. Assume P is a matrix of m
x n2 and the m component column vector R. Let pi,j de-
note the (i,j)th element of P , and Ri denote the ith ray of
m,
the reconstructed projection vector R. For 1

3 TEST FIGURE

It is instructive to test the reconstruction capabilities of
ART with two to four views by using projections from a
known test ﬁgure. In the following example, we have used
an x-y coupled (about 18◦ )two-dimensional gaussian en-
closed in a square space of 100 x 100 array with σx = 5
and σy = 20. We have used a ray width in the 45◦ and
135◦ projection as √2 times of ray width in x or y projec-
tion, making number of ray in each projection same namely
100. Fig. 1 shows the test ﬁgure and reconstructed test ﬁg-
ure from two projections. Fig. 2 shows reconstructed test
ﬁgure from three and four projections.

ﬁgure from two projections.

Figure 2: Reconstructed test ﬁgures from (a) three and (b)
four projections.

Fig. 3 shows the contours of Figures 1 and 2.

It is
clear from Fig. 3 that two projections are not enough for
catching the coupling. The accuracy of the reconstructed
ﬁgure from four projection is slightly better than three pro-
jections. Fig. 4 shows the discrepancy (D), variance (V),
the entropy (E) and the Euclidean Distance (s) as a func-
tion of iteration number for case of three projections. The

4 BEAM DENSITY MEASUREMENT

There are stepping wire proﬁle scanners at 13 locations
throughout the 200 MeV linac and transport lines. These
scanners are mounted at a 45◦ angle with respect to hori-
zontal, and single horizontal and vertical wires are stepped
through the bea We have added a third wire at 45◦ to hor-
izontal in two of the scanners, one in the 750 keV line [2]
and one in the 200 MeV BLIP [3] transport line. Fig. 5
shows a schematic of the scanner with three wires. Fig.
6 shows the reconstructed density distributions at 750 keV
line. There is no x-y coupling in the 750 keV line. Fig. 7
shows beam density contour plots in the BLIP line. The x-
y coupling is clearly seen. This coupling could come from
one or more rotated quadrupoles or vertical beam offset in
a dipole. In the presence of x-y coupling, the usual tech-

more locations will not work. Figure 8 compares the mea-

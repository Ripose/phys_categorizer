Abstract

A double kicker system which extracts the ultra-low emit-
tance multi-bunch beam stably from ATF damping ring was
developed. The performance of the system was studied
comparing an orbit jitter with single kicker extraction in
single bunch mode. The position jitter reduction was es-
timated from the analysis of the extraction orbits. The re-
duction was conﬁrmed for the double kicker system within
a resolution of BPMs. More precise tuning of the system
with a wire scanner has been tried by changing a β function
at the second kicker to get more reduction of kick angle jit-
ter. The results of these studies are described in detail.

INTRODUCTION

KEK/ATF is an accelerator test facility for an injector part
of a future linear collider. It consists of an S-band injector
linac, a beam-transport line, damping ring and extraction
line [1]. The main purpose of ATF is to generate and mea-
sure ultra-low emittance multi-bunch beam (2.8nsec spac-
ing, 20bunch) and develop technology that can stably sup-
ply the beam to the main linac.

tical kicker magnets for beam extraction. The ﬁrst kicker
is placed in the damping ring and the second one for jitter
compensation in the extraction line.

The ATF extraction kicker consists of 25 electrode pairs
with ferrite loaded in a vacuum chamber. A ceramic tube
with TiN coated inside is used for beam channel in the
kicker in order to reduce an beam impedance. The spec-
iﬁcation of the kicker is summarized in Table 1.

2 DOUBLE KICKER SYSTEM

The double kicker system consists of one pulse power sup-
ply and two kicker magnets separated by phase advance π.
It is, in principle, able to compensate kick angle variation
of the extraction kicker in damping ring. When each kicker
has a kick angle variation ∆θ1 and ∆θ2, (x, x′) at the sec-
ond kicker can be written as

x′(cid:19) = M1→2(cid:18) 0
(cid:18) x

∆θ1(cid:19) +(cid:18) 0
∆θ2(cid:19)

(1)

Here, M1→2 is a transfer matrix from the ﬁrst kicker to the
second one. Since a phase difference of the two kickers is
π,

x′(cid:19) =

are obtained. When the two kickers are identical, that is
∆θ1 = ∆θ2, the variation could be canceled with the same
β function. If the two kickers are not identical, compen-
sation also can be done by adjusting β function. In case
of multi-bunch extraction, only the similarity of the ﬂat-
top waveform between two kickers is required for the jitter
reduction in each bunch. A tight ﬂatness requirement for
every bunch in a multi-bunch is not necessary.

Figure 1: Layout of injection/extraction region of ATF

The stable beam extraction from the damping ring is es-
sential for linear collider to achieve high luminosity, be-
cause the position jitter would be magniﬁed by transverse
wakeﬁelds in the linac and reduce the luminosity. There-
fore, the jitter tolerance of extraction kicker magnet is very
tight and estimated to be 5 × 10−4 assuming βx = 10m[2].
It will be applied not only to a uniformity of pulse magnetic
ﬁeld for the tolerance of multi-bunch but to a pulse-to-pulse
stability. In ATF, double kicker system was developed for
the stable beam extraction [3]. The system uses two iden-

3 ORBIT JITTER REDUCTION

We measured horizontal beam orbit jitter of the extraction
line in single bunch operation and compared the perfor-
mance of the double kicker system with the case of extrac-
tion without the second kicker which we deﬁned as a single
kicker mode.

The operation condition at the measurement was single
bunch mode, beam energy 1.3GeV, and repetition rate is
0.78Hz. The beam is extracted from damping ring to the
extraction line by one kicker magnet and three DC septum
magnets. Kick angle of the kicker is designed to 5mrad. In
single kicker mode, a dipole magnet was installed instead
the second kicker.

The beam orbit shot by shot was measured by strip-line
BPMs in the extraction line [4]. Total 14 BPMs are used
for the measurement and analysis.

3.1 Analysis method

The horizontal beam position jitter in the extraction line
came from a kick angle jitter of the extraction kickers and
a momentum ﬂuctuation of the beam. The horizontal dis-
placement at a point after the second kicker can be written
as

∆xi = ∆xkicker + ∆xmomentum

= R12(1, i)∆θ1 + R12(2, i)∆θ2 + ηi

∆p
p

(4)

where R12(1, i) is a transfer matrix component from the
ﬁrst kicker to the point i , R12(2, i) is from the second one
and ηi is a dispersion. In this analysis, ∆θ1,∆θ2 and ∆p/p
were obtained by ﬁtting the measured displacement from
the average position at BPMs with eq(4). ∆xkicker was
from the displacement at
calculated by subtraction ηi
each BPM. In single kicker mode, the same analysis also
has been done, but ∆θ2 was set to zero because the dipole
magnet installed as the second kicker is DC magnet.

3.2 Result of jitter reduction
Table 2 shows the comparison of the position jitter caused
by kick angle variation in both modes at the BPM where
has the maximum R12 from the kicker.

σkicker was calculated by using model value of R12 and
ﬁtting value of kick angle variation of each shot. The ef-
fect of jitter reduction was compared in the two kick an-
gle region. As a result, the double kicker system reduced
the jitter down to the resolution of BPM which is about
20µm in case of small kick variation, however the reduc-
tion rate was not sufﬁcient in case of large kick variation.
In both cases, the position jitter reduction was observed for
the double kicker conﬁguration, however, a precise tuning
of the system and a high resolution position monitor are
still necessary for a further reduction.

4 OPTICS TUNING

In order to get more jitter reduction, β function at the sec-
ond kicker was surveyed using high resolution position
monitor. One of the wire scanners was used as a position
jitter detector [5].

Jitter measurement with wire scanner

4.1
The wire scanner which have 10 µm diameter tungsten wire
was used for the jitter measurement. Scattered gamma rays
from the wire are detected by air Cherenkov detector with
photo multiplier. Before orbit measurement we measured
horizontal beam proﬁle and set the wire at the position
which is middle of the slope of the proﬁle. The distribu-
tion of detected gamma rays is converted to the distribution
of the position with beam proﬁle. Horizontal beam size
was around 100 µm in these measurements.

4.2 Optics tuning method
Changing β function at the second kicker, a minimum po-
sition jitter was surveyed. However, the condition of jitter
compensation was different in each optics setting because
dispersion and orbit was corrected in each setting indepen-
dently. Then the position jitter caused by kick angle vari-
ation was compared by normalizing each condition with β
function 2.5m at the wire and phase advance 1.5 π from the
second kicker. The result is summarized in Table 3 .

With these values a β function of maximum jitter re-
duction and kick angle jitter are estimated. Assuming
model optics and kick angle ratio k, kick angle variation

reduction optics changing β function at the second kicker
was performed with wire scanner. The β function which
gave a minimum position jitter was found. Estimated β
function for it was 7.13m and this corresponded to the kick
angle ratio of the two kickers 0.833.

were obtained.

Measured β function at the ﬁrst kicker was 4.95m, so
β function at the second kicker for maximum jitter reduc-
tion was estimated to be 7.13m. The estimated resolution
10.7µm is included monitor resolution and incoming posi-
tion and angle jitter. The resolution of this position monitor
using wire is estimated about 1µm, then it seemed that the
beam orbit of damping ring had ﬂuctuation in these mea-
surements. The kick angle ratio 0.833 is not explained by
the difference of the cable length between the two kickers
(9.4m). It seemed that the difference of ceramic coating
between the two kickers caused the much difference of the
ﬁeld strength.

5 CONCLUSION

The performance of the double kicker system was studied
with measurement of horizontal orbit jitter in single bunch
mode. The system has the jitter less than the resolution of

Abstract

A simple model for calculation of diﬀraction radiation character-
istics when ultrarelativistic charged particle moves close to a tilted
ideally conducting strip has been developed. Resonant diﬀraction ra-
diation (RDR) is considered as superposition of radiation ﬁelds for
periodically positioned strips. RDR characteristics have been calcu-
lated in dependence on the number of grating elements, tilted angle,
and initial particle energy. There has been noticed an analogy with
both resonant transition radiation in absorbing medium and paramet-
ric X-ray radiation.

Introduction

In papers [1-4] characteristics of electromagnetic radiation from in parallel
passing relativistic particle above diﬀraction grating (so-called Smith-Purcell
eﬀect (SPE)) have been considered. The interest to similar kind of radiation
is associated, ﬁrstly, with possibility of SPE using for generation of inten-
sive radiation in millimeter and submillimeter region [5] and,secondly, with

possible non-destructive beam diagnostics [6]. In both cases estimation of
inﬂuence such factors as transverse beam sizes, beam angular divergence,
monochromaticity, ets. on radiation characteristics is interesting.

In principle inﬂuence of beam divergence in plane which is parallel to the
grating one can estimate using the results of article [4]. However, there is no
simple algorithm for calculation of radiation characteristics at tilted particle
passing above the grating, i.e. for non-zero angle between particle trajectory
and main plane of the grating.

By one of the authors, in article [2] there was developed an approach
based on description of SPE as resonant diﬀraction radiation (RDR) and
suitable for calculation of radiation characteristics for a grating consisting of
the number of strips from conducting material spaced by vacuum gaps. In
the presented article there were calculated the RDR characteristics for non-
parallel particle moving with respect to the grating and studied the inﬂuence
of geometry on the RDR characteristics.

For calculation of RDR characteristics for a tilted grating it is neccessary
to ﬁnd diﬀraction radiation ﬁeld from charged particle moving close to a
single tilted strip.

In the paper [7] there was obtained the exact solution of Maxwell equation
describing radiation of charged particle moving above inclined semi-inﬁnite
screen from ideal conductor. Using that results and also results of article
[8] one can obtain an expression for strength of DR ﬁeld for a tilted strip
as diﬀerence of radiation ﬁelds for two semi-inﬁnite planes one of which is
restricted by edge 1, and the other one − by edge 2 (see Fig.1):

For convinience let us express the impact parameter (the shortest distance

between particle trajectory and plane edge) for edge 1 by following way:

→
Estrip=

a1 = h −

whereas for edge 2:

Here h is distance between particle tragectory and average line of the
strip, a is strip width, Θ0 is strip inclined angle. Thus, taking into account
the phase shift we have:

a1 = h +

sin Θ0.

In (4) DR ﬁeld for semi-inﬁnite ideal screen is expressed through

→
EDR (ai).
Full phase shift (2φ) characterizes phase diﬀerence between waves forming
in the vicinity of edge 1 and edge 2 [9] and can be obtained from simple
geometrical relations as a value which is propotional to diﬀerence of wave
propagation times from edge 1 and edge 2 (see Fig.1):

2φ =

(5)

where β is particle velocity.
In the paper there is used the system of units where h = m = c = 1.

For the limited cases (Θ0 = 00 and 900) phase shift calculated according

to (5) coincides with obtained one in [2].

Formula (4) is valid if the following conditions for strip dimensions are
fulﬁlled: γλ >> b, γλ << c (see Fig.1). Here γ is Lorentz - factor of the
particle, λ is DR wavelength.

We consider the radiation characteristics in the coordinate system where
z axis directs along the beam, x axis is parallel to the strip edge, and y axis
is perpendicular to this edge. As it is shown in [8], for relativistic particles
radiation concentrates in the angle range:

|Θx| ≤ γ−1

if γ >> 1.
In this approximation the following expression for DR yield with wave-

length λ may be obtained:

Obtained expressions are fully analogous to formulas for the spectral -
angular distribution of transition radiation (TR) from a foil (see, for instance,

[10]). In considering case Fstr characterizes interference of DR ﬁelds from
two strip edges, whereas in case of TR the analogous multiplier characterizes
interference of TR ﬁelds from input and output surfaces of the foil.

Spectral-angular density of DR for semi-inﬁnite screen was obtained in

ultrarelativistic approximation in [9]:

In (12), in numerator and denominator there were neglected the terms

less than ∼ γ−2.

Let us consider the radiation in forward direction (forward diﬀraction ra-
diation, FDR), i.e. for the angles Θy ∼ γ−1 << 1. Using this approximation
we have instead of (12):

As it was noticed in [8], in angular distribution of DR at Θy = Θx = 0

there is a maximum which value is proportional to γ2:

As it follows from (12), for mirror reﬂection angle (Θy = 2Θ0) angular
distribution has another maximum, which is identical to (14) and can be iden-
tiﬁed as ”backward diﬀraction radiation, BDR” by analogy with the process

of transition radiation. Coincidence of FDR and BDR in the whole frequency
range is a consequence of using of ideally conducting screen approximation.
It is obvious that this approximation does not valid when ωc ≥ ωp, where ωp
is plasmon energy of the screen material.

In the angle range |2Θ0−Θy| ∼ γ−1, i.e. in the vicinity of mirror reﬂection
direction, the BDR spectral-angular density also has the view (13), however,
in this case angle Θy is counted out from mirror reﬂection direction (see.[8]).
Thus, expression (15) is valid when the following conditions are fulﬁlled:

Θy >> γ−1,

|2Θ0 − Θy| >> γ−1

(16)

As it follows from (15), in that case DR density is about γ2 times less.
Fig.2 shows the dependences of DR yield for ﬁxed observation angle
Θy = 4.50, in reﬂection plane (Θx = 0) on the strip inclined angle Θ0 (so-

6

called orientation dependences). The calculations have been carried out using
formulas (10)−(12) for γ = 1000, λ = 0.4mcm, a1 = 0.1mm. One can notice
that in case of γλ ≥ a sin Θ0 DR yield is strongly supressed and characteris-
tic angular width of the dependence is signiﬁcantly higher than value ∼ γ−1,
which is typical for DR on a semi-inﬁnite screen (see Fig.2). Furthermore,
DR intensity in maximum of orientation dependence is also suppressed in
case of γλ ≥ a sin Θ0.

Resonant diﬀraction radiation on a tilted
grating

Let us consider a grating consisting of N strips, with the width a, and period
d, tilted under the angle Θ0 to the electron momentum (see Fig.3). The
distance between the ﬁrst strip middle and electron tragectory (1) we express
through h.

Radiation ﬁeld forming on the strip 1 of the grating coincides with ex-

One should notice that the structure of the formula (25) is identical to
analogous formula for resonant transition radiation in N layers with taking
into account radiation absorption in every layer.

Let us consider the particular case corresponding to Smith-Purcell geome-
try (Θ0 = 0). It is obvious that decay factor α0 determied by expression (20)
equals zero, therefore, expression (25) can be rewritten in the well-known
form:

When N → ∞ expression (26) transforms into usual δ- function:

FN =

sin2( N φ0
2 )
sin2( φ0
2 )

FN = 2πNδ(φ0 − 2kπ)

(26)

(27)

where k is diﬀraction order.

δ-function presence says about existing of monochromatic maxima in
RDR spectrum. However, not always is δ− function using justiﬁed for real
gratings where the number of elements is limited. So, further we shell use
the exact formulas (25), (26).

Fig.4 depicts the spectral distribution of RDR for Smith-Purcell geometry.
The calculation has been carried out for the case of a = d
2 , when the maximum
intensity is reached [2]. In spectrum the peak position is determined by phase
relation (resonance condition):

which leads to well-known formula of Smith-Purcell:

φ0 = 2kπ,

As it is seen from the picture, one can observe the even order missing in
spectrum. The present regularity is explaned by inﬂuence of Fstr factor that
equals zero at:

λk =

φ0 = mπ,

(30)

where m is integer (see formula (11)).

After putting (29) in (5) the condition (30) can be written in the view:

Thus, in considering case (a = d
2) even diﬀraction orders are forbidden.
For illustration, Fig.5 shows the dependence of Fstr on photon energy which
was calculated for the same conditions as Fig.4.

Fig.6 shows the dependences of DR yield in maxima for four radiation

orders on the ratio a
d.

As it was noticed above, maximum intensity for the ﬁrst diﬀraction order

is reached at a

d = 0.5, whereas for the second one − at a

d = 0.25 and 0.75.

Let us consider the case of tilted grating. One should notice that in spec-
trum quasimonochromatical peaks can be observed at small inclined angles
of the grating. The spectrum for the tilted strip calculated according to
(10) is shown on Fig.7. Strip parameters and geometry are indicated on this
picture. As in case of semi-inﬁnite screen one can observe the exponentially
decreasing spectrum.

On the Fig.8 there is depicted the RDR spectrum on the tilted grating
calculated at Θ0 = 1.90. Unlike spectrum on a single strip calculated for
the same initial conditions, here one can observe the spectrum of the ﬁrst

order of quasimonochromatical radiation ﬁnite determined full width on half
maximum (FWHM) together with the continuous background.

Position of quasimonochromatical maxima in RDR spectrum is deter-
mined by resonance condition (28) where phase φ0 is taken according to the
formula (19). We shell illustrate this fact by following way. Let us rewrite
expression (25) in the form:

FN =

1 − 2 exp{−(N − 1)α0} cos{(N − 1)φ0} + exp{−2(N − 1)α0}
1 − 2 exp{−α0} cos φ0 + exp{−2α0}

(32)

In limited case, when N → ∞ we have instead of (32):

1
1 − 2e−α0 cos φ0 + e−2α0
It is clear that obtained expression reaches maximum value when the

F∞ =

(33)

following conditions are fulﬁlled:

φ0 = 2kπ

(cos φ0 = 1)

(34)

In this case:

At small values of α0 << 1 that corresponds to small inclined angles of

the grating Θ0 << 1, from (35) we have:

Thus, noticeble quasimonochromatical maxima in DR spectrum can be
observed at sliding particle beam incidence angle with respect to the grating.
For the angle Θ0 6= 0 instead of Smith-Purcell conditions we have the follow-
ing connection between quasimonochromatical maximum position, period d,
grating tilted angle Θ0, and observation angle Θy:

λk =

where k is integer.
Fig.9a shows the dependences of diﬀerent order maximum positions on

the target orientation angle at observation angle Θy = 4.50.

Figure 9: Dependences of diﬀerent order peak position (9a) and of
the ﬁrst DR order yield (9b) on inclined angle.

One can notice that for negative values of Θ0 (i.e.

for geometry where
”reﬂected beam” from the grating is directed to the opposite side from the
detector) the spectral maxima are removed in soft part with respect to the
SPE spectrum (Θ0 = 0). When inclined angle increases, spectral maxima
are removed in high energy part.

The analogous peak shift of parametric X-ray radiation while rotating of
a crystallic target has been registered in the experiment [11]. Actually, for
both RDR and PXR peak position in spectrum is determined by resonance
condition only, and it does not depend on the radiation mechanism.

In the experiments on investigation of PXR there is oftenly measured so-
called theta-scan, i.e. dependence of radiation yield for the ﬁxed observation
angle and electron energy on the target orientation angle. Fig.9b presents
the calculation results of analogous dependence for RDR. In this case the
grating tilted angle Θ0 is varied with respect to the electron beam.

In the experiment [12] there has been measured a similar dependence
for Smith-Purcell eﬀect for a grating made up by a periodically deformed
continuous surface. The authors of the quoted paper obtained a dependence
with clear maximum. This dependence is rather close to the presented one
on Fig.9b.

N dependence (dotted

elements.

On the Fig.10a there is presented the dependence of full peak width (∆E)
on the number of grating elements for the ﬁrst diﬀraction order and inclined
angle Θ0 = 10 (solid line).

There is also shown the analogous dependence for SPE which is well
N dependence (dotted line). As it follows from the picture,
N formula where C1 = 1.8

approximated by 1
for Θ0 6= 0 the obtained curve is approximated by C1
for Θ0 = 10.

When the number of periods increases, the RDR intensity increases reach-

ing 0.95I∞ level for N = 70 (see Fig.10b).

Let us estimate the eﬀective grating length (the number of periods) which

the passing particle ﬁeld interacts with:

Nef f =

γλ
d sin Θ0

(38)

In the considering case Nef f = 60 that is rather close to the grating length

providing 95%th intensity level.

When the particle moves close to the grating of limited length (with the
number of periods N) one can derive the analogous caracteristic for Lorentz-
factor:

Fig.11 shows the dependence of Imax on the particle energy.As it follows
from the picture the simple estimation (39) well characterizes the RDR pro-
cess in this case too.

Conclusion

A simple model for calculation of RDR characteristics on a tilted grating
has been suggested, and there has been shown that in RDR spectrum quasi-
monochromatic maxima appear,and their characteristics (full width, inten-
sity) is ﬁrstly determined by grating inclined angle.

The obtained expressions allow to estimate the characteristics of SP ra-
diation for the particle beam with ﬁxed emittance. On the other hand, RDR
from a tilted grating can be used for non-destructive diagnostics of charged
particle beams.

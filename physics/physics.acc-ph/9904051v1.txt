Compyter analysis of undulators with block-periodic
stucture

Abstract

Methods to detect the spectral sensitivity of an object using undulator radi-
ation without monochromators or any other spectral devices are developed. The
spectral transmission function of the object is calculated from its response to
the spectrum-integral undulator radiation with the known spectral distribution.
This response is measured as a function of the electron energy.

l. Introduction

At present, synchrotron radiation (SR) is widely used in spectroscopy as
a standard source, the monochromatic components usually being obtained by
mono- chromators or other spectral devices. However, a large intensity loss and
variation of the transmission function during the operating time are inherent to
such measurements.

Recently, undulator radiation (UR) has been discussed as an alternative.
As is known [1], monochroma- tization of UR can be partially achieved by
increasing the period number. UR serving as a standard source in spectroscopy
without monochromators has been discussed in ref. [2]. It appears that the UR
resolution is not only limited by the spectral line width that depends on the
period number, but is also limited by the spread of angles and electron energies,
the undulator magnetic ﬁeld nonuniformity over the beam cross section, the
ﬁnite diaphragm size, and other factors.

In this connection, a monochromatorless computer spectroscopy method
(MCS method) has been proposed [3,4], the computer algorithm playing the
part of the monochromator. The point is that the radiation from an undulator
installed in the synchrotron ring is not pure UR as assume’d in the ideal theoret-
ical model [1,5], but also includes the SR components from the edges of bending
magnets and focusing elements adjacent to the undulator. In practice, one uses
the frequency partition of SR and UR spectra to exclude the admixed SR and
to conserve the ideal UR properties [6]. But we cannot admit this method to be
consistent with the requirements of metrology, according to which all the ideal
UR properties (angular monochromatization, polarization, independence of the

1

UR spectral form from the particle energy) need to be conﬁrmed by adequate
quantitative measurements.

2. Amplitude-time modulation

In the MCS method, the electron-energy-invariant spectral form of the. ra-
diation source turns out to be a kernel of the integral equation, the solution of
which being just the MCS problem. In order to make the UR kernel metro-
logically pure, we have to exclude the admixed SR. To this end we can use a
procedure consistng of a series of consequent measurements of the undulator
radiation at various states of the undulator magnetic system and the subse-
quent combination of these results. Such a procedure will be referred to as the
amplitude - time modulation (ATM).

Parameters varying in the ATM process are those of the undulator, which
do not disturb the properties of the admixed SR. This means that the phase
relations for the SR components must be invariant during ATM. This implies
the constancy of the time t for a charge travelling along a straight section of
length l between the edge elements adjacent to the undulator:

l + k2L
2γ2

.

l +

t =

1
c h
Here L is the undulator length, γ the Lorenz factor of the charge (γ−1
1), c
is the light velocity, and k is the undulator dipole parameter. The directional
modulation of the magnetic ﬁeld in the undulator or in some of its blocks is a
special case of ATM since the electron transit time is conserved. The magnetic
ﬁeld in any block satisﬁes the balancing condition, i.e., the ﬁeld integral over
the block length vanishes.

Suppose A(ω) and B(ω) are the complex Fourier amplitudes of the ideal UR
and the SR, respectively. Every A(ω) corresponds to one undulator magnetic
ﬁeld state. Let us consider the following four states: the basic state A; the state
(
A), which diﬀers from A in that the undulator magnetic ﬁeld is switched on
−
with an orientation opposite to the ﬁeld in the elements forming the electron
orbit and adjoining the undulator; the phase-discontinuous state ˜A obtained by
the reverse-sign switching of the magnetic ﬁeld in some undulator blocks; and
˜A). Adding the radiation intensi- ties in the ﬁrst and second states
ﬁnally (
and subtracting those in the third and the fourth states, we obtain

Thus, the four-step ATM with phase switching enables us to exclude the SR
and to obtain the metrologically pure UR kernel for MCS as an element of the
ideal UR (eq. (2)). The practical realization will be especially simple when one
ATM step corresponds to one acceleration cycle. In this case, we need only four
cycles to achieve a metrologically pure procedure with UR.

3. Undulator magnetic system

2

Among the various possible realizations of the undulator magnetic system for
MCS with UR, the electromagnetic ironless system is preferable since only such
a system has the desired properties, such as linearity, predictability, reiteration
and the ability to change undulator states quickly. A block-periodic organi-
zation of the ironless electromagnetic undulator system in which the resulting
distribution of the magnetic ﬁeld is a superposition of ﬁelds from standard el-
ements switching on mth given weights, seems to be the most suitable one for
many types of ATM. In the general case, because of the common standard el-
ements, the blocks may overlap one another with the equivalent summarized
overlap weight.

The MCS technique needs no monochromatization devices since the com-
puter algorithm plays the part of the monochromator. Thus we avoid the many
order waste of the source intensity, which is usually inevitable with radiation
monochromatization. It appears from this that an undulator with the dipole
regime of UR excitation (k
1) will be quite eﬀective in achieving an adequate
reaction of the object in the MCS technique. The dipole regime is favourable
also with regard to the ’operation of the undulator magnetic system, since the
decreased heat and electromagnetic loads permit the ironless variant of this
system to be used.

≪

Therefore, we can now regard the undulator dipole regime as the basic one
for the MCS technique with UR, and so the model investigations of MCS with
UR, based on the dipole approximation expression for UR, become legitimate.
In ATM it is important to provide the coincidence of the low-frequency trend
components of the motion in the undulator for diﬀerent steps of the ATM pe-
riod. The amplitudes of the low-frequency components of the spectrum depend
essentially on the values of the integrals

where H(x) is the magnetic ﬁeld along the undulator axis and b is the block
length. We shall call the motion of a particle in a block an m-time balanced
motion, when J1 = J2 = ... = Jm = 0. The Fourier structure of the UR line of
a block with the motion balancing degree m contains the factor)

where ¯ω = π(ν + 1)/2, ν = η(1 + ψ2) is the number of the UR harmonic at
an angle θ to the motion axis, ψ = γθ/√1 + k2, η = pω(1 + k2)/2πcγ2, ω is
the radiation frequency, p is the magnetic ﬁeld half-period length, and N is
the number of standard elements in the block. The low-frequency asymptote
for such a spectrum is ν2m .
It appears from this that in the region 0 <
ν < 1 the UR spectral density at a given direction θ is suppressed and the
number of spectral function zeros decreases when m increases. This causes

3

the oscillating part of the angle-integral UR spectrum to be depressed. As a
result, the diﬀerence UR kernel of the type of eq. (2) formed by the ATM is
localized in a region of the high-frequency cut-oﬀ of the fundamental harmonic.
The maximal balancing degree in a block consisting of N standard elements
equals N
l. In this case, the maximal smoothness of the UR integral spectrum
and the maximal frequency, angle and polarization localization of the diﬀerence
kernel of type (2) are obtained. The balancing degree desired is achieved by
thc proper choice of the standard element weights. For example, for m = 1 we
have the standard element weight distribution 1, 2, 3, ..., 2, 1 and for m = 2 we
get 1, 3, 4, 4, ..., 4, 3, 1. With increasing m the weight distribution tends from a
trapezoidal to a binomial one, the latter corresponding to m = N

Eq. (4) is a basic one in the MCS problem. In order to solve this problem
the object reaction is measured as a function of the particle energy. The speetral
density K(τ ) of the UR photon ﬂux is measured experimentally or calculated
using known formulas. The spectral sensitivity of the object Z(s) is found

are applied to solve ill-deﬁned problems. The angle-integral density of the UR

where n is the number of blocks and D is the distance between the neighbouring
blocks. The geometric param- eters of the standard elements and their number
M are found from the basic initial parameters, namely, the undulator length
and the undulator gap. Knowing M one can start a model run in order to ﬁnd
the remaining parameters

then D < 0, D/p being an integer. The qualitative criteria for the results of
this run are: (i) the vanishing ∆ in eq. (5) with D/p < 0; (ii) the correctness
of the solution of the MCS problem with the obtained UR kernel.

the low-frequency component of the UR kernel K(x
takes place in the undulator blocks.

(2) When m increases, localization of the UR kernel in the region η

1 of the
high-frequency cut-oﬀ of the total ideal kernel occurs. This monochromatization
eﬀect corresponds to the angular localization of the UR kernel in the angular
(0, 1/√N ), in accordance with the known formula ν = η(1 + ψ2).
range ψ
This angular localization near the direction ψ = 0 causes the preferable selection
of the σ-component of UR polarization and the strong depression of the π-
component, since the intensity of the π-component is small for directions ψ <
1√N .

WAKE FIELD EFFECT ANALYSIS IN APT LINAC

Abstract

The 1.7-GeV 100-mA CW proton linac is now under
design for the Accelerator Production of Tritium (APT)
Project [1]. The APT linac comprises both the normal con-
ducting (below 211 MeV) and superconducting (SC) sec-
tions. The high current leads to stringent restrictions on
allowable beam losses (< 1 nA/m), that requires analyzing
carefully all possible loss sources. While wake-ﬁeld effects
are usually considered negligible in proton linacs, we study
these effects for the APT to exclude potential problems at
such a high current. Loss factors and resonance frequency
spectra of various discontinuities of the vacuum chamber
are investigated, both analytically and using 2-D and 3-D
simulation codes with a single bunch as well as with many
bunches. Our main conclusion is that the only noticeable
effect is the HOM heating of the 5-cell SC cavities. It, how-
ever, has an acceptable level and, in addition, will be taken
care of by HOM couplers.

INTRODUCTION

A wake ﬁeld analysis for a high-intensity accelerator typ-
ically includes wake and/or coupling impedance computa-
tions, and following calculations of loss factors and heat-
ing due to various elements of the vacuum chamber, as
well as a study of possible instabilities. Beam coupling
impedances and loss factors can be obtained from wake
ﬁelds computed by time-domain codes like ABCI [2] and
MAFIA [3]. However, this approach works only for an
ultrarelativistic bunch, with β = v/c = 1, because of difﬁ-
culties formulating open boundary conditions for β < 1 in
time domain.

There are two speciﬁc features of the wake-ﬁeld analysis
in proton (or H−) high-intensity linacs. First, β is signif-
icantly less than 1 for the most part of the machine. Re-
sults at β = 1, while provide useful estimates, can be quite
different from those at the design β values in some cases,
In particular, the resonance impedances
see, e.g., [4].
and corresponding loss factors can strongly depend on β.
Frequency-domain calculations provide an accurate answer
for a given β < 1, but typically they are limited to just
a few lowest modes. Second, the beam in high-intensity
linacs is either CW, or consists of macropulses containing
many regularly spaced bunches. As a result, the beam fre-
quency spectrum is concentrated only near the multiples of
the bunch repetition frequency fb. Of course, the spectrum
envelope is deﬁned by the bunch shape, but due to short
bunch length it rolls off at frequencies many times higher
than fb.

Therefore, an important question to consider is whether
any higher mode has its frequency close to a multiple of

fb. The presence of such modes, especially at relatively
low frequencies, can lead to undesired coherent effects.
We use time-domain computations with multiple bunches
to answer this question. The idea is to apply a standard
time-domain code with a few identical bunches at β = 1,
but to set the bunch spacing s to s = c/fb for having the
correct bunch repetition frequency. Since the resonance
frequencies are essentially independent of β, so is a con-
clusion from such simulations. In this note, we concentrate
only on this aspect of the wake-ﬁeld studies for the APT.
Speciﬁcally, we apply the code ABCI [2] to compute lon-
gitudinal and transverse wakes in axisymmetric models of
the APT 5-cell superconducting (SC) cavities using a vary-
ing number of bunches and looking for coherent wake-ﬁeld
effects.

2 MULTIPLE-BUNCH EFFECTS IN APT

SC CAVITIES

Wake potentials of a train of a few identical Gaussian
bunches passing through a 5-cell APT SC cavity have been
computed with the code ABCI [2]. Geometrical parame-
ters of the APT cavities are given in [5]. The bunch rms
length was chosen to be 4.5 mm in the β=0.82 section, and
3.5 mm for β=0.64. While these bunches have β=1, their
separation is set to s=0.85657 m, which gives the proper
bunch repetition frequency fb=350 MHz.

We study the loss factor for the 5-cell APT SC cavities as
a function of the number of bunches Nb in the bunch train.
We expect that the loss factor per bunch tends to a constant
for incoherent wakes, but it should increase linearly when
wakes are coherent. The coherent effects occur if higher-
mode resonances are close to multiples of fb. Correspond-
ingly, the loss factor for the total train is proportional to Nb
if there are no coherent effects, or increases faster, up to
N 2

b , otherwise.
The results for the transverse loss factor ktr per bunch
are shown in Fig. 1, both for β=0.64 and β=0.82. As one
can see from Fig. 1, ktr reaches its asymptotic already for
Nb between 5 and 10 in the case of β=0.82. This asymp-
totic value, in fact, is lower than ktr for a single bunch. For
β=0.64, however, we observe an almost linear growth up to
Nb about 20, and only after that the behavior changes and
the transverse loss factor per bunch saturates. Therefore, in
the β=0.64 cavity higher-order dipole resonances are closer
to multiples of fb than those for β=0.82. For comparison,
the total longitudinal loss factor for both cavities depends
quadratically on Nb, while the loss factor per bunch in-
creases linearly as Nb increases. This is, of course, due
to the fundamental accelerating mode of the cavity, whose
frequency is 700 MHz.

(their) properties into account in designing HOM couplers.

The wake potentials for a bunch train with a monopole
(on-axis beam) and dipole (off-axis beam) excitation look
quite differently. There is a strong coherent build-up of
the amplitude of the longitudinal wake as long as bunches
travel through the cavity. The bunches in the train interact
with each other through the excitation of the cavity fun-
damental mode. On the contrary, no apparent increase is
observed for the transverse wake potential; wakes left by
individual bunches are incoherent in this case. Therefore,
one can use a maximal value of the transverse wake from
these simulations as a reasonable estimate of that for a very
large number of bunches, cf. Fig. 2. The maximum wakes
from Fig. 2 allow to estimate the strength of beam-induced
deﬂecting ﬁelds in the cavities for use in beam-dynamics
simulations.

To identify the frequency range where a higher dipole
resonance in the APT SC β=0.64 5-cell cavity has its fre-
quency close to the multiple of the bunch frequency fb=350
MHz, we plot in Fig. 3 the power spectrum of the wake po-
tential produced by a 30-bunch train in the cavity. One can
see in Fig. 3 a regular structure of peaks at multiples of
fb, as well as a peak near 950 MHz, which corresponds
to the band of the TM110 dipole mode [6]. Comparison
of the wake power spectra for different Nb shows that the
magnitude of this last peak decreases quickly as one goes
to longer and longer bunch trains, since there is a smaller
and smaller excitation at this frequency. However, it is
the strong peak near 1750 MHz — the multiple of the
bunch frequency — that produces a coherent increase of
the dipole loss factor. Fortunately, its resonance frequency
is close to the cutoff frequency of the pipe, which means
this resonance can be effectively damped by HOM power
couplers. Nevertheless, a more detailed analysis of this
frequency range with frequency-domain codes is required
to identify the corresponding eigenmode(s), and take its

As the number of bunches in the train increases, its
frequency spectrum is getting more and more concen-
trated near the multiples of the bunch repetition frequency.
Stronger peaks in the wake power spectrum for a relatively
long bunch train indicate the frequency regions where the
cavity resonances are close to multiples of fb. We show in
Figs. 3-6 the power spectra of both the transverse and lon-
gitudinal wake potentials for 30-bunch trains. The wake
potentials have been calculated for 30 m after the lead-
ing bunch in all cases, they include about 60,000 points,
and their Fourier transforms have been performed with
N = 216 = 64K. A logarithmic scale is used for the
longitudinal spectra, otherwise the pictures would be dom-
inated completely by the cavity fundamental mode at 700
MHz.

using bunch trains which have β=1, but a correct bunch
repetition frequency fb. As the number of bunches Nb in-
creases, the details of the beam frequency spectrum, which
are dependent both on β and Nb, become unessential since
the cavity is excited mostly at multiples of fb. The ap-
proach allows applying standard time-domain codes, for
example, [2].

Using this method we have found a few potentially dan-
gerous frequency ranges of higher-order modes for the
APT superconducting cavities. More details can be found
in [7]. A further analysis with frequency-domain codes is
required to identify the modes in these frequency ranges,
and to take their properties into account in designing HOM
couplers.

tial for 30 bunches in the 5-cell β = 0.64 cavity.

Comparing relative peak heights in the frequency spec-
tra shows where higher-order modes are close to multiples
of the bunch frequency. Clearly, the potentially dangerous
regions for the 5-cell β=0.64 APT SC cavities are: around
1750 MHz and 1050 MHz with respect to the dipole modes;
and near 2100 MHz for the monopole ones (of course, apart
from 700 MHz). Since 2100 MHz is above the beam-
pipe cutoff, one should expect a trapped monopole mode
near this frequency. For 5-cell β=0.82 APT SC cavities
these regions are: around 1750, 700, and 1050 MHz for the
transverse modes (but all those contributions are relatively
weak) and near 1750 and 1050 MHz for the longitudinal
ones. Also, some additional attention is probably required
to the transverse modes near 950 MHz for β=0.64 and in
the range 900–950 MHz for the β=0.82 cavities. While
these frequencies are not close to a multiple of fb, the cor-
responding dipole resonances are strong enough that their
effects are observed even for rather long bunch trains.

The power loss in the structure has been computed to be
4.5 kW/m and the required ﬂow to obtain a ∆T , between
RF on & RF off for the structure, of 1 ◦C is ∼ 1ℓ/s. For
a ﬁlling time of 100 ns, a raise of 0.5 ◦C is equivalent to a
4◦ phase shift at the structure output. This phase shift will
induce less than a half % of energy variation for the beam
(∆E/E < 0.5%) if not compensate, and is acceptable.
This 0.5 ◦C range is the temperature tolerance for the entire
LINAC water cooling system [6].

Vertical vibration of linac components (accelerating
structures, girders and quadrupoles) in the NLC has been
studied experimentally and analytically. Effects such as
structural resonances and vibration caused by cooling wa-
ter both in accelerating structures and quadrupoles have
been considered. Experimental data has been compared
with analytical predictions and simulations using ANSYS.
A design, incorporating the proper decoupling of structure
vibrations from the linac quadrupoles, is being pursued.

INTRODUCTION

As the limit for the next generation of collider is again
pushed further, alignement of components and their stabil-
ity are critical. As part of the R&D effort for the Next Lin-
ear Collider (NLC), a program has developed to study the
vibrations induced by cooling water on the NLC linac com-
ponents [1] [2]. Similar studies are also underway at CERN
for the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) [3].

An adequate ﬂow of cooling water to the accelerating
structures is required in order to maintain the structure at
the designated operating temperature. This ﬂow may cause
vibration of the structure and its supporting girder. The
acceptable tolerance for vibration of the structure itself is
rather loose ∼ 1µm. However our concern is that this vi-
bration can couple to the linac quadrupoles, where the vi-
bration tolerance is 10 nm, either via the beam pipe with its
bellows or via the supports.

In this paper we will review the results obtained for the
NLC RF structure and girder, those obtained for an elec-
tro magnetic (EM) quadrupole when fed with water and
ﬁnally the results of coupling between the structure and the
quadrupole when only the structure is fed with water.

2 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The structure studied, DDS standing for Damped and
Detuned structure, is 1.8 m long, weight ∼100 kg and is
supported by a “strongback” (hollow aluminum box beam
4x6 inches) of the same length, Fig.1 and 2. In the design,
it was assumed that 3 such structures would be mounted
on a single 6 m long girder [4].
It should be noted that
the NLC currently plans to use shorter RF structures than
the one studied [5], probably 90 cm . The required water
ﬂow (at 70MV/m loaded gradient) is about ∼1 ℓ/s for each
structure (in total, through four cooling copper tubes). The

In the ﬁrst set of experiments, we measured the vibra-
tion induced by different ﬂow rates passing through the
structure-girder system, as shown in Fig. 1. The water
was the same as supplied to the NLC Test Accelerator
(NLCTA) area. The RF structure was mounted to a con-
crete block of ∼2225 kg. The block was installed on rub-
ber balls (∼14Hz resonance) to isolate it from the noisy
ﬂoor of NLCTA. Vibration was monitored by four piezo-
accelerometers (PCB Piezotronics, INC model # 393B31)

Quantitatively, the incoming water can be characterized
by the spectrum of its pressure ﬂuctuations. The integrated
spectrum was measured by a pressure piezo-transducer in
the NLCTA setup as shown in Fig.5. The incoming pres-
sure causes vibration of the RF structure through the force
it exerts on the surface of the cooling pipes (usually equal
to cross-section of the pipe). It is interesting to note that the
spectrum of the incoming NLCTA water is rather smooth
and does not contain sharp peaks typically associated with
the rotational frequencies of pumps. This indicates that the
turbulence itself, and not the pumps, was the cause of the
pressure ﬂuctuations.

The NLC cooling system will be designed so that pres-
sure ﬂuctuations in the cooling water will be limited (if
necessary, by use of passive devices as typically done in
industry [7]), internal turbulence will then dominate. Thus,
aiming to understand the contribution to vibration from in-

and one piezo-transducer (PCB model # 112A21) was used
to measure water pressure ﬂuctuations. The diameter of
each of the four cooling pipes were 1.9 cm (OD). The ﬂow
of water and the pressure were measured by a Venturi tube
and by two manometers installed at the input and output
supply.

The second set of experiments were designed to study
the vibration caused only by internal turbulence. The
structure-girder was in a quieter place on the ﬂoor of the
SLD (SLAC Large Detector) collider hall and the cooling
water was gravity-fed from a tank located ∼18 m above.
The structure-girder was bolted to a ∼26T concrete block
initially placed on a rubber mat and then on sand (in the
ﬁrst conﬁguration the block had resonance at ∼35Hz which
was decreased in the second case). The maximum water
ﬂow through the structure was limited to about 1.1 ℓ/s. The
structure-girder was connected to the quad with a bellows,
and a simple mock-up of a BPM was connected (glued) to
the quadrupole Fig.2. A primary vacuum, sufﬁcient for our
tests, of ∼ 10−1 Torr could be obtain in the vacuum pipe.
In each experiment, it was possible to feed the water to
the structure either by using the 4 tubes in parallel or by
feeding only 2 tubes at one end which were then connected
in series to the adjacent tubes at the other end. In the latter
case, the ﬂow in 2 tubes was in countered ﬂow.

3 VIBRATION OF RF STRUCTURE

Fig.3 displays the results obtained in measuring the
vertical vibration induced by different ﬂow rates passing
through the structure-girder system shown in Fig.1. Note
that the system considered is above the turbulence thresh-
old (Re>2000) when the ﬂow > 0.1 ℓ/s. In Fig.3 the water
was supplied by the NLC Test Accelerator (NLCTA) wa-
ter system. In this case, the displacement of the structure-
girder is weakly dependant of the ﬂow in the structure be-
cause vibration is dominated by hydraulic noise from water
supply pumps. The supplying cooling water has signiﬁcant
ﬂuctuations of pressure in it (external turbulence). Fig.4
shows that vibration is not dominated by water ﬂow. Dis-
placement is largest when cooling inlet or outlet is open to
supply pump but outlet or inlet is closed (no ﬂow). Merely

conducted the second set of experiments.

4 VIBRATION OF RF STRUCTURE AND

COUPLING TO QUADRUPOLE

Using the setup of Fig.2 we have studied the vibration
of RF structure versus ﬂow, and the coupling of vibration
from the RF structure to the EM quadrupole in the case
when RF structure is cooled with gravity-fed water.

Vibration of the RF structure versus ﬂow is shown in
Fig.6. In this case, vibrations are caused mostly by the in-
ternal turbulence occurring in the RF structure. At nom-
inal ﬂow 1 ℓ/s, vibration of the structure is ∼110nm,
compared to 350nm obtained with NLCTA cooling water
Fig.3. Additional vibrations of the quadrupole are small.
Performing multiple measurements with and without ﬂow,
and analyzing spectra of quadrupole vibration (Fig.7), we
found that the additional vibration of the quadrupole due
to cooling of RF structure above 30Hz is 2.4nm (obtained
as p(4.32 − 3.62), assuming vibrations are uncorrelated),
see Fig.8. Taking a lower cut frequency would be sta-
tistically uncertain, due to high background noise of the
concrete block at lower frequency. These results suggest
that coupling from RF structure to the quadrupole is about
2% in the current conﬁguration. We also investigated in-
ﬂuence of vacuum in the RF structure (and possible stiff-
ening of the bellow) on this coupling. No noticeable dif-
ference was observed with or without vacuum (the results
displayed in Fig.6 are obtained with a primary vacuum
of about 10−1 Torr in the structure-quadrupole system).
However, we have not yet studied how much coupling is
due to the bellows connection and how much due to trans-
mission via support and concrete.

One should also note that the present set up is simpliﬁed.
In particular, the quadrupole was placed on a small granite
stand (with shims to adjust the height), which was placed
on concrete block (without rigid connections). Such system
had ampliﬁcation – the quadrupole vibration is higher than

5 SIMULATION AND THEORY

We have shown in [1] that the vibration spectrum of
the girder-structure system exhibits a vertical resonance at

∼52Hz Fig.4. The natural ﬁrst resonant frequency for such
design, obtain through simulation with ANSYS, is about
∼49 Hz. This calculated result is in good agreement with
measurements, and corresponds to simplest vertical bend-
ing mode Fig.9. These simulations also indicate that the
second and the third modes are the horizontal dipole at
∼69 Hz and vertical two-nodes mode at ∼117 Hz, while
the fourth resonance is torsional ∼146 Hz.

the structure is taken equal to 0.01. The amplitude of vi-
brations is inversely proportional to the square root of the
damping factor. The Reynolds number and boundary layer
thickness relations are based on empirical data. Depending
on whether the ﬂow has a cavitating source or not, the ap-
propriate empirical equations for turbulent power spectral
density need to be employed as well.

Since our model (single pipe) is simpler than the real
structure-girder system, we adjust the external diameter of
the modelling pipe to match at least the main mechanical
characteristics to those of the real system.
In particular,
we match the ﬁrst resonance frequency. This can be done
by either changing the OD or the Young modulus of the
modelling pipe. The 3 resonant frequency for the curves
in Fig.10 are respectively for the cross 47.97 Hz, for the
circles 24.78 Hz and for the triangles 49.55 Hz. By artiﬁ-
cially multiplying the Young modulus by a factor 4, we are
able, for a 5cm OD structure, to obtain the right resonant
frequency. We suppose that the best representation, by our
semi analytical model, of the system copper structure - alu-
minium girder is given by taking the right dimension of the
structure (5 cm) and adjusting the elastic modulus.

The theoretical results should be compared with the ex-
perimental data obtained when the structure is fed with
”quiet” water Fig.6. The comparison between the cir-
cles, and the experimental results for the structure (labelled
DDS), shows that the semi-analytical model overestimates
the vibration induced by the ﬂow, by a factor 8 at nominal
ﬂow 1 ℓ/s. There is agreement for ﬂows between 0.2 ℓ/s
and 0.4 ℓ/s. It is interesting to see that those curves can be
ﬁtted by a simple power law :
Displacement = C1 * Flow C2;
Applying this ﬁt on our model, Fig.10 circles, with the cho-
sen C1 C2parameters gives :
Displacement = 7.5 10−7 * Flow2.6

We also did compare our theoretical results with the an-
alytical formula suggested in [9]. In this case we use the
formula assuming that the frequency is equal to the the res-

Figure 9: ANSYS simulation of the RF structure and Alu-
minium girder, showing the lowest resonance mode.
The driving forces (ground motion, water pressure and
ﬂow, ) decrease rapidly with frequency. One possibility to
further reduce the vibration of the structure-girder system
is to design a girder which has a higher ﬁrst resonant fre-
quency. For further studies, we have set a goal of increasing
the lowest resonance frequency to 130 Hz and performed
simulations to understand what modiﬁcations this would
require. One way to stiffen the girder is to increase its di-
mensions. Simulations have shown that keeping the same
material and design but increasing the girder size (6”x4” to
10”x10”) and the wall thickness (from 0.25” to 1”) lead to
a lowest natural frequency of 120 Hz. Such big increase
of the resonance frequency may not be necessary, but the
studies have shown that signiﬁcant improvement is possi-
ble with simple modiﬁcation of the girder design.

In parallel with the experiments and ANSYS analysis, a
semi analytical model is currently under development [8].
Based on this model, an estimation of the vibration caused
by the ﬂowing water has been computed for several cases.
Results are displayed in Fig.10.

The model assumes a single pipe rigidly supported at
each end, with inner diameter (ID) equal to the ID of a
cooling pipe, but with a different thickness (OD). The ac-
tual OD of the structure is ∼5cm. In order to scale to a
system with 4 pipes, rather than multiplying the result by
4, we assume that turbulence in different pipes is indepen-
dent. The total amplitude can be estimated by multiplying
the results by the square root of the number of pipes. This
vibrational analysis model is based on a combination of ob-
served and analytical techniques. The forcing function [8]
is measured in experimental model tests and using this as
input, the rms (root mean square) responses are estimated
based on probabilistic methods. In order to estimate quanti-
tatively the turbulence-induced vibrations, some empirical
data have been used. The mechanical damping factor of

onance f of the mechanical system. The frequency f is not
dependent of the ﬂow as in [9]. Fig.11 is the results at a
50 Hz resonant frequency. The simple theory derived from
[9] gives a total displacement which is ∼200 times higher
than the reality at nominal ﬂow (10−7 m at 1 ℓ/s), Fig.6.
Again the theory can be ﬁtted with a power law (green
curve) :
Displacement = 2.2 10−5 * Flow0.86
In both cases, the power law ﬁts theoretical estimation
which are derived from more complex formulae. However,
the meaning of the parameters C1 and C2 are not under-
stood. We applied this last power ﬁt to our structure data
(DDS), Fig.6 gray curve, and by barely changing C2 pa-
rameters and reducing C1 by a factor 150, we were able
to ﬁt them. It seems that the dependance of the vibration
versus the ﬂow is a function with a square root dependency
(0.8) rather than a power dependency (2.5). In short, one
theory predicts better the amplitude, while the other bet-
ter predicts the dependence on the ﬂow, and neither can be
fully trusted.

Figure 12: EM quadrupole vibration measurement setup.

Assuming that the additional vibration is uncorrelated, the
effect due to cooling water itself is: p(3.522 − 1) =
3.35 nm. The result is similar if a lower cut off frequency
(e.g. 15Hz) was considered, until below 10Hz where sta-
tistical error becomes too big. Note that earlier studies of
FFTB quadrupole stability [10] have shown that the effect
of the cooling water is on a nanometer level as well, for
quadrupoles that were (in contrast to our study) also prop-
erly placed on movers.

7 DISCUSSION

With these data, we can estimate that in the pessimistic
case, if the cooling water will be similar to NLCTA (with
similar pressure ﬂuctuations), vibration of the quadrupoles
will scale to about 7.6nm (2.4nm*(350nm/110nm)) due
to coupling to the RF structures.
In the case of EM
quadrupoles, there will be about 3.3nm additional due
to cooling of the quadrupoles themselves, which in total
amounts to p(7.62 + 3.32) = 8.3nm. This value is below
the tolerance but has little margin. However, simple design
optimizations of girder or use of passive devices, such as
damping materials placed in or on the girder as well as in
between the water supply system and the structures in order
to reduce the ﬂuctuations of pressure ∆P seen in the supply
system, are expected to reduce these numbers considerably.
Among further studies of RF structure and quadrupole
vibration planned at FNAL and SLAC are: performing
measurements in a quieter place, quantifying lower fre-
quency range; studying the case of quadrupole placed on
movers and realistic independent supports; and continuing

6 VIBRATION OF EM QUADRUPOLE

The NLC project calls for maximal use of permanent
magnet (PM) quadrupoles which will not need cooling
water. The electromagnet quadrupoles (EM) however are
also prototyped for NLC and we studied vibration caused
by cooling water in such an EM quadrupole. The EM
quadrupole was fed by a standard water supply at a nomi-
nal ﬂow of ∼0.1 ℓ/s obtained with pressure difference of
8.5 bar. The quadrupole was installed on a granite table
Fig.12. The table was installed on rubber pads to isolate
the table from the high frequency vibration in the noisy
environment where measurements were performed. This
reduced the high frequency background, but signiﬁcantly
ampliﬁed frequencies below 6-9 Hz, making it possible to
study the effect of cooling water on quadrupole vibration
only above about 10Hz.

For f>20Hz,

the vibration induced by the ﬂow of
∼0.1 ℓ/s in the quad is roughly 3.5 nm±0.25 nm while
1 nm±0.25 nm at rest (averaged on several measurements).

8 CONCLUSION

the case studied, mechanical

Cooling water can cause vibration of an accelerating
structure both through internal turbulence in the cooling
pipes on the structure, and through pressure ﬂuctuations in
the supply water (external turbulence) [1]. The latter does
not depend on the ﬂow rate through the structure and can
be the dominant source of vibration in practical situations.
For
the
structure-girder assembly explain the measured ampli-
tudes. Optimization of design to increase resonance fre-
quencies is expected to reduce vibration. Coupling from
RF structure to linac quadrupoles can occur via bellows and
the support, and was measured to be at the percent level.
Present studies suggest that the vibration tolerances for the
NLC linac quadrupoles are met, but without much margin.
Optimization of the girder design to improve its vibration
properties is highly desirable and will be pursued.

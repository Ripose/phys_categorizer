Theory of electron cooling using electron
cooling as an intrabeam scattering process

George Parzen

February 2, 2008

Abstract

Electron cooling that results when a bunch of electrons overlaps a
bunch of ions , with both bunches moving at the same velocity, may
be considered to be an intrabeam scattering process. The process is
similar to the usual intrabeam scattering, where the ions scatter from
each other and usually results in beam growth. An important diﬀer-
ence is that in electron cooling the mass of the ion is diﬀerent from
and much larger than the mass of the electron. This diﬀerence con-
siderably complicates the intrabeam scattering theory. It introduces
a new term in the emittance growth rate, which vanishes when the
particles are identical and their masses are equal, and can give rise to
emittance cooling of the heavier particles . The term that gives rise to
beam growth for the usual intrabeam scattering is also present but is
much smaller than the cooling term when one particle is much heavier
than the other. This paper derives the results found for the emittance
cooling rates due to the scattering of the ions in the ion bunch by the
electons in the electron bunch.

1 Introduction

Electron cooling that results when a bunch of electrons overlaps a bunch of
ions , with both bunches moving at the same velocity, may be considered to
be an intrabeam scattering process. The process is similar to the usual intra-
beam scattering, Ref.[1] where the ions scatter from each other and usually
results in beam growth. An important diﬀerence is that in electron cooling

the mass of the ion is diﬀerent from and much larger than the mass of the
electron. This diﬀerence considerably complicates the intrabeam scattering
theory. It introduces a new term in the emittance growth rate, which van-
ishes when the particles are identical and their masses are equal, and can
give rise to emittance cooling of the heavier particles . The term that gives
rise to beam growth for the usual intrabeam scattering is also present but is
much smaller than the cooling term when one particle is much heavier than
the other.

This paper derives the results found for the emittance cooling rates due
to the scattering of the ions in the ion bunch by the electons in the electron
bunch. The derivations given below makes considerable use of the results
found in two previous papers, Ref.[2] and Ref.[3]

2 The f (x, p) distribution and the scattering

rate δN

The ions are contained within a bunch and their distibution is given by
fa(xa, pa) where Nafa(xa, pa) is the number of ions in d3xad3pa. Na is the
number of ions in the bunch.

d3xad3pa fa(xa, pa) = 1

Z

The distribution of the electrons in the electon bunch is given by fb(xb, pb)
and Nb is the number of electrons in the electron bunch. Let δNa be the
number of ions with momentum, pa in d3pa and space coordinate x in d3x
which are scattered by the electrons with momentum pb in d3pb which are
also in d3x, in the time interval dt , into the solid angle dΩ′ corresponding to
the direction ˆp′

a. Then δNa is given by, Ref.[2],

F (pa, pb) =

σab is the scattering cross section for the scattering of the ions from the
electrons.In the expression for F (pa, pb), we have put c = 1. F (pa, pb) has
the dimensions of a velocity.

For completeness sake this result is given in the form which is valid in any
CS. For the electron cooling problem for RHIC, one can do all the calclations
in the Rest CS, which is the CS moving along with the two bunches. In the
Rest CS, the central particle in either bunch is at rest and the motion of the
motion of the particles may be treated non-reletavistically.In the Rest CS ,
one may put γa = γb = 1 and

F (pa, pb) = | ~va − ~vb|

3 Growth rates for < piapja >

Following Bjorken and Mtingwa, Ref.[4], cooling rates will ﬁrst be given for
< piapja >. where the <> indicate an average over all the particles in
the bunch. From these one can compute the growth rates for the average
emittances of the ions, < ǫia >. In a scattering event, where an ion with
momentum pa scatters oﬀ an electron with momentum pb, the momenta will
a and p′
change to p′
b. Let δpia represent the change in pia in the collision, and
similarly for δ(piapja). Then

δpia = p′
δ(piapja) = p′

ia − pia
iap′

ja − piapja

Using the scattering rate given by Eq.(1), one can now compute δ <

piapja > in the Rest CS,

The 11-dimensional integral in Eq.3 can be reduced to a 3-dimenional
σab
integral for gaussian distributions, if one notes that in the Rest CS
depends on ~va − ~vb and one transforms from the momentum variables pa, pb
to two new variables one of which is ~va − ~vb. This can be done by the
transformation

∆i is proportional to the relative velocity, ~va − ~vb when the velocities are
non-relativistic. A similar transformation is used in Ref.1 and Ref.4 except
that for them the particles are identical and the transformation is simpler.

δ(piapja) can be written as

δ(piapja) = piaqja + pjaqia + qiaqja
ia − pia

qia = p′

This result can written as

δ(¯pia ¯pja) = [(Wi ¯qja + Wj ¯qia)

One may note that σab depends only on ∆ and not on W . In the expression
for δ(¯pia ¯pja) the second term will be seen to depend only on ∆ and gives rise

to the usual intrabeam scattering growth rate, while the ﬁrst term depends
on W and will be seen to vanish for identical particles and gives rise to the
cooling rates for ion electron scattering.

The transformation from ~pa, ~pb to ~W , ~∆ allows us to do the integral over
dΩ′. Eq.7 holds in any CS where the particle motion is non-relativistic. For
each ~pa, ~pb one can deﬁne a center of mass CS, called the CMS, in which
~pa + ~pb = 0. In the CMS

∆i = ¯pia − ¯pib = pia/(γ0β0µc)

In the CMS, ~∆ and ~pa have the same direction, and ~pa is scattered by the
′ which is along the direction given by the polar angles θ, φ
electrons to ~pa
relative to the direction of ~pa or ~∆.

In Eq.7, only the ¯qia depend on the scattering angles θ, φ . To do the

integral over dΩ′ in the Rest CS one has to evaluate the integrals

dΩ′σab ¯qia

di =

cij =

Z

Z

dΩ′σab[(∆i ¯qja + ∆j ¯qia) + ¯qia ¯qja]

dΩ′σab is an invariant and ~∆, ~qa are both the same in the CMS and the Rest
CS as they are both the diﬀerence of 2 vectors that are proportional to a
velocity. di, cij are tensors in 3-space. If these integrals are evaluated in the
CMS and the result is written in terms of tensors in 3-space then the result
will also hold in the Rest CS.

In the CMS, we introduce a polar coordinate system θ, φ where θ is mea-
sured relative to the direction of ~pa or ~∆ and we assume that σab(θ, φ) is a
fumction of θ only. we can then write

~∆ = (0, 0, 1)|~∆|
~pa = (0, 0, 1)|~∆|(γ0β0µc)
′ = (sin θ cos φ, sin θ sin φ, cos θ)|~∆|(γ0β0µc)

~qa = (sin θ cos φ, sin θ sin φ, cos θ − 1)|~∆|(γ0β0µc)

Eq.12 can be used to compute either intrabeam scattering for identical
particles or electron cooling. If the a and b particles are identical, then the
]2 and called the ∆-term gives the growth rates
second term indicated by [
for intrabeam scattering. In this case, the ﬁrst term, indicated by [
]1 and
called the W-term, will vanish. This is shown below for gaussian distributions
and also can be shown to hold for any distribution because of the symmetry
of the a and b particles. If the b particle is much lighter than the a particle,
the W-term gives rise to cooling of the a particles and the ∆-term is smaller
than the W-term by the factor mb/ma. This is shown below for gaussian
distributions. Eq. 12 holds for any distibutions, fa(x, pa), fb(x, pb). In the
next section, we will specialize to gaussian distributions.

bmaxab is the maximun allowed impact parameter in the CMS. θmin is the
smallest allowed scattering angle in the CMS.

It will be seen below that to compute the cooling rates for the emittances
one will also need the cooling rates for < xiapja >. When the a and b particles
are identical, the < xiapja > are zero , but not zero when the particles are
diﬀerent. Using Eq.7, one ﬁnds

< δ(xi ¯pja) > = Nb

Eq.15 shows that < δ(xi ¯pja) > gives rise to a cooling term which vanishes
when the particles are identical , or when αi = 0 for the ion partcle for a
gaussian distribution.

4 Cooling rates for < piapja > in the Rest CS

for Gaussian distributions

In this section, we will ﬁnd the cooling rates due to the scattering of the ions
by the electrons in the cooling section when the ion and electron bunches
have gaussian distributions. In Eq.12 , we will keep only the W -term as the
∆−term , discussed later, is smaller by the factor mb/ma In this paper, it
will be assumed that the dispersion is zero in the cooling section.

For a gaussian distribution, fa(x, pa) is given for the ion bunch for zero

dispersion by Ref.[3],

A longitudinal emittance has been introduced so that the longitudinal motion
and the transverse motions can be treated in a similar manner. βs in the
Rest CS is larger than βs in the Laboratory CS by the factor γ2
0. s, ps are
the paricle longitudinal position and momentum in the Rest CS.

In Eq.12 we will now do the integration over d3xd3W using the above
gaussian ditributions. Because there is no dispersion in the cooling section
the integral over dxdWx or dsdWs or dydWy can each be treated in a similar
way. Eq.12 can now be written using the Coulomb cross-section as

Eq.23 is our ﬁnal result for the cooling rates for < piapja > in the Rest
CS, for two overlapping gaussian bunches , with no dispersion in the cooling
section. For this case one gets zero results when i 6= j. The remaining 3-

dimensional integral over d3∆ is an integral over the relative velocities of the
ions and electrons.

It will be seen below that to compute the cooling rates for the emittances
one will also need the cooling rates for < xiapja >. For gaussian distribu-
tioins, using the coulomb cross section and Eq.15, Eq.18 is replaced by

5 Emittance growth rates

One can compute growth rates for the average emittances, < ǫia > in the
Laboratory Coordinate System, from the growth rates for < piapja > in the

The ∆ term in electron cooling

In the previous section it was assumed that in Eq.12 one could drop the
second term or ∆ term compared to the ﬁrst term or W term.This is true
when mb << ma and ¯pa ≃ ¯pb in the Rest CS. Using Eq.4, one can write

ma
ma + mb

+ ¯pb

mb
ma + mb (cid:21)i

Wi =

¯pa

(cid:20)
∆i = [¯pa − ¯pb]i

Wi ≃ [¯pa]i
∆i = [¯pa − ¯pb]i

(26)

(27)

(28)

Thus W and ∆ are both of the same order as ¯pa .
If the motion is non-
relativistic in the Rest CS, ¯qa ≃ ∆ ≃ ¯pa. From this it follows that the ∆
term in Eq.12 is smaller than the W term by the factor mb/ma.

It has also been assumed that the motion in the Rest CS is non-relativistic.
In the Laboratory CS, the rms spread in the relative momentum is given by

For gold ions in RHIC at γ = 100

¯ǫx = ¯ǫy = 5e − 8, βx = βy = 50 and σpx = σpy = 2.24e − 5

¯ǫs = 1.8e − 4, βs = 300m and σps = .55e − 3

In the Rest CS σpx, σpy are unchanged at 2.24e-5 And σps is reduced by the
factor γ to .55e-5 The spread in each of the momenta in the Rest CS is of
the order of 1e − 3mac since γ = 100 and the ion velocities are of the order
of 1e-3c. Similar numbers hold for the electrons in the electron bunch.

Abstract

Through the simultaneous measurement of the transverse size as a function of longi-
tudinal position, and the longitudinal distribution of luminosity, we are able to measure
the β∗
y (vertical envelope function at the collision point), vertical emittance, and bunch
length of colliding beams at the Cornell Electron-positron Storage Ring (CESR). This
measurement is possible due to the signiﬁcant “hourglass” eﬀect at CESR and the excel-
lent tracking resolution of the CLEO detector.

One of the diﬃcult problems in colliding beam physics is the measurement of beam param-
eters at the collision point. In this letter, we present a method of making such a measurement
using precision measurements of the luminous region with e+e− → µ+µ− events detected by
a general purpose high energy physics experiment. Key to this measurement is the detailed
geometry of the highly focused colliding beams, which leads to the “hourglass” eﬀect.[1]

Tightly focused beams have a “waist” at the focal point of the ﬁnal quadrupoles and their

size grows away from this waist. The transverse beam size is given by

σ(z) =

ǫβ(z)

q
where β(z) is the amplitude or beta function, which depends on the longitudinal position, z, of
the beam and the emittance, ǫ, which is independent of z. Near a waist, β(z) can be written
as

(1)

(2)

β(z) = β∗ +

(z − z0beta)2
β∗

where β∗ is the value of the beta function at the waist and z0beta is the longitudinal position
of the waist. Thus the beam in the longitudinal and transverse dimensions forms an hourglass
shape with a minimum size at z0beta.

The hourglass eﬀect arises from the beam being in Gaussian shaped bunches with length
σz. If the bunch length is long compared with the dimension of the waist, then little of the
beam is colliding where the beam is narrowest. In this case, the longitudinal distribution of
luminosity depends not only on σz, but also on the horizontal and vertical value of the beta
function at the interaction point, β∗
y , respectively. In addition if either β∗ is smaller
than σz, luminosity does not improve as much as naively expected by making β∗ smaller.

x and β∗

The luminous region is deﬁned by the overlap integral of two beams. Thus we expect the
vertical width of the luminous region as a function of the longitudinal position to be given by

same for the two beams. The beam parameters for the Cornell Electron-positron Storage Ring
(CESR) for the data discussed in this paper are given in Table 1. All the parameters in Table 1
are given at zero bunch current. They are all expected to depend on the bunch current. We have
previously observed that β∗
x is reduced by roughly a factor of two in colliding beam conditions
due to the dynamic beta eﬀect.[2] Likewise, β∗
y is expected to be reduced by about 25% due to
beam-beam focusing. The vertical emittance depends on the beam-beam tuneshift parameter;
for operation in the saturated tuneshift regime, the vertical beam size increases linearly with
bunch current. Additionally, there are streak camera observations which show an increase in
σz as the bunch current increases.[3] The method described in this paper is aimed at measuring
some of these dynamic eﬀects by direct observation of the luminous region.

Note that these measurements are taken over a long time, about four months of CESR
and CLEO running, and at many diﬀerent machine conditions. Thus we expect only rough

distribution of luminosity is expected to signiﬁcantly depend on β∗

negligible. This is due to the large size of β∗
x as compared to σz. Thus we expect a negligible
hourglass eﬀect in the horizontal size of the luminous region as a function of longitudinal
position. This is also why we consider only one value for z0beta which could, in principle, be
diﬀerent for the horizontal and vertical beta functions.
Our goal is to measure the beam parameters, β∗

y , ǫy, and incidentally σz. We do this with
a simultaneous ﬁt to the measured vertical width of the luminous region versus longitudinal
position, and the longitudinal distribution of luminosity. The vertical width depends on ǫy, the
longitudinal distribution on σz and they both depend on β∗
y .

CESR has been described in detail elsewhere. [4] All the data used in this measurement are
taken at an e+e− collision energy of 10.58 GeV, and with bunch currents in the range of 2.5
to 7.0 mA over a four month period in late 1998 and early 1999. The CLEO detector has also
been described in detail elsewhere.[5] All of the data used in this measurement are taken in the
CLEO II.V conﬁguration which includes a silicon strip vertex detector which is crucial to the
measurement of the luminous region. This consists of three layers of silicon wafers arrayed in
an octagonal geometry around the interaction point. The ﬁrst measurement layer is at a radius
of 2.3 cm and the wafers are read out on both sides by strips which are perpendicular to each
other. The readout strips have a pitch of about 100 µm and with charge sharing the detector
has an intrinsic per point resolution of better than 20 µm in both the transverse plane and the
longitudinal direction

To obtain a resolution of order 10 µm on the luminous region, we selected e+e− → µ+µ−
events. These are easily selected in CLEO as events with two and only two tracks each with

Figure 2: An ensemble of stiﬀ tracks passing through the box allows for a precision measure-
ment of the luminous region. For example, the track labeled 1 only gives a useful measure of the
vertical position of the luminous region, as indicated. Track 1 crosses the the entire horizontal
extent of the box and its average horizontal position is simply the center of the box, rather
than the center of the luminous region. Similarly track 2 only measures the horizontal position,
while track 3 measures both the horizontal and vertical positions of the luminous region.

momentum near the beam energy and a small energy deposit in the electromagnetic calorimeter.
We chose tracks with 20 or more hits in the main drift chamber, and at least two silicon vertex
detector hits in the transverse and longitudinal views. We require that the tracks have opposite
charge and that those used for the measurement of the luminous region have at least three silicon
vertex detector hits in one of the two views.

We implement a method, called the “box technique,” to obtain measurements of the beam
parameters and the resolution. Figure 2 shows how this technique is implemented. First, the
size and location of the luminous region are obtained from run average data using hadronic
events.[2] A three-dimensional box is then centered about the measured center of the luminous
region with sides ten times the measured widths of the luminous region. The average position
of a track passing through the box is found. From an ensemble of such positions the size and

5

shape of the luminous region is measured.

Tracks that are parallel to an axis of interest are the most useful for measuring the luminous
region. Tracks that are perpendicular to an axis cross the full length of the box in that direction
and give no information about the luminous region. We select appropriate tracks by cutting
on the direction cosines. Essentially, these cuts are determined by the size of the luminous
region, which is roughly 10 µm vertically, 300 µm horizontally, and 10000 µm longitudinally.
Thus a tight cut of |py/p| ≡ | cos θy| < 0.1 is needed to measure the vertical luminous region,
a looser cut of | cos θx| < 0.3 for horizontal, and | cos θz| < 0.7 for longitudinal. For tracks
with large | cos θz|, the resolution degrades, and the | cos θz| cut of 0.7 is also used on tracks to
make vertical and horizontal measures. Because of these direction cosine cuts, a single track
can measure, at most, two dimensions.

We tested this method using over 100,000 e+e− → µ+µ− simulated events. To measure
the change in the vertical size of the luminous region as expected from the hourglass eﬀect,
a constant vertical resolution is necessary. Thus we made selections in the simulated data to
test the stability of the resolution and found signiﬁcant dependences only on tracks with large
values of | cos θz|, which are eliminated by the direction cosine cut discussed above, and on the
| cos θy| of the tracks. The 0.1 cut on the | cos θy| is a compromise between a smaller cut value
with improved resolution, and a larger value with increased statistics. Thus the resolution on
the vertical luminous region is expected to be 26.4 ± 0.4 ± 1.5 µm with the ﬁrst error due to
the statistics of the simulation sample and the second due to the sharp dependence on the
| cos θy| cut. This vertical resolution is small enough and there are suﬃcient data to obtain
a statistically useful sample to measure the size of the luminous region at large longitudinal
positions. These can be compared with similar measures dominated by the resolution taken
at small longitudinal positions. In the analysis, we extract the resolution from the data itself,
thus there is no dependence on the prediction from the simulation.

Figure 3 shows the vertical width of the luminous region as a function of its longitudinal
position. This plot clearly shows the vertical distribution growing away from the center. This
is evidence of the hourglass eﬀect. We have also repeated this procedure for the horizontal
width. We observe a horizontal width of 296 µm and see no signiﬁcant hourglass eﬀect. These
observation both agree with our expectation.

When measuring the longitudinal distribution of luminosity as a function of the longitudinal
position, we see a sharp enhancement in the distribution for small values of the longitudinal
position. This enhancement is caused by the existence of a non-sensitive region in the center
of the detector which greatly diminishes the chance for tracks passing through this region to
be accepted for analysis. This geometric eﬀect is accurately modeled in our simulation, and we
use it to extract a longitudinal position dependent correction for the longitudinal distribution
of luminosity. Applying this eﬃciency eliminates large systematic eﬀects in our extraction of
β∗
y . The longitudinal distribution of luminosity both before and after the eﬃciency correction
is shown in Figure 4.

To extract the beam parameters, we ﬁt Figure 3 to Equation 3, including resolution smear-
ing. Unfortunately, such a ﬁt does not give a useful measurement of any of the beam parameters,
and has nearly 100% correlations among β∗
y , ǫy, and the resolution. We take advantage of the
dependence of the longitudinal distribution of luminosity on β∗
y as given in Equation 4, and

The resolution of the box technique on the longitudinal position of the event production
point is better than 40 µm. This is negligible in comparison with the longitudinal size of the
luminous region, which is over one centimeter. In fact, the box technique can be used to make
a very high precision measurement of the bunch length, σz. As discussed in Reference [3] the
bunch length in CESR is seen to depend on the bunch current and the bunches are asymmetric
with their heads being narrower than their tails. Due to the collision of the two bunches this
single bunch asymmetry is washed out in the longitudinal distribution of the luminous region.
The luminosity distribution would only be distorted away from a Gaussian shape if the single
bunch asymmetry were an order of magnitude larger than the observed ∼ 5%. If we allow an
asymmetry in the luminosity distribution, we observe none with a ±1% accuracy. This also
conﬁrms our need for an eﬃciency correction which takes out a 1.5% asymmetry in the raw
data.

We have tested this simultaneous ﬁt procedure with the simulation, and expect that our ﬁt
is able to measure the input beam parameters and the resolution. We also derived expectations
on the errors and correlations the ﬁt should return based on our data statistics.

Table 2 shows the results of the ﬁt to the data. From the ﬁt we observe some large corre-
lations. These are between β∗
y and σz, between ǫy and the resolution, and between z0beta and
z0bunch These correlations are -88%, -75%, and -85% respectively. They are of the size predicted
by our tests on simulated data. All other correlations are smaller than 40% in magnitude..

These are in good agreement with the errors expected from the simulation study, the CESR
beam parameters of Table 1, and streak camera observations.[3] Note that we obtain very
accurate measures of β∗
y and σz, along with a resolution from the data consistent with our
expectation of 26.4 ± 1.6 µm from the simulation, but only a 1.4 standard deviation measure

of ǫy. The results follow our expectations from the dynamic eﬀects caused by the non-zero
bunch current. The value for β∗
y is lower than the zero bunch current value, but not as small as
the lowest recorded. The value for ǫy is not measured well enough to make a meaningful test,
but it is certainly consistent with an increase. The σz is increased by 6.6% which is consistent
with the streak camera observations.[3] The diﬀerence between z0beta and z0bunch, −3740 ±
130 µm, is consistent with known strength diﬀerences between the ﬁnal focus quadrupoles and
alignment tolerances between ﬁnal focus elements and RF cavities which respectively determine
the longitudinal position of the beta waist and the center of the bunch collision.

In an attempt to improve the measure of ǫy, we repeat the data ﬁt with the resolution ﬁxed
to 26.4 µm, as predicted by the simulation. This ﬁt does give a slightly improved measurement
of ǫy of 0.0049 ± 0.0028 µm with the other parameters changing negligibly. When we vary the
ﬁxed resolution by ±1.6 µm as indicated by the simulation studies, this introduces an error of
±0.0028 µm on ǫy. The combined error of ±0.0040 µm on ǫy = 0.0049 µm is consistent with,
but not a substantial improvement over the results of Table 2. We prefer to quote results for
the ﬁt where the resolution is left ﬂoating.

We varied the standard ﬁt to test its robustness. We excluded positive z, negative z, small z,
and large z data from the ﬁt. A χ2 ﬁt is used rather than a likelihood ﬁt. The only parameters
that show signiﬁcant disagreement with the standard result are β∗
y and σz. Other facets of the
analysis are varied and the procedure is repeated to estimate other systematic eﬀects. Cuts
on the direction cosines are varied, ±0.01 on cos θy and ±0.1 on cos θz, we relax the three
silicon vertex detector hits in one view to a looser two hit per view requirement, we vary
the procedure for applying the eﬃciency for the luminosity as a function on the longitudinal
position, and use the simulation eﬃciency without errors as an estimate of the eﬀects of our
limited simulation statistics. Some of the measured vertical widths are not consistent with their
longitudinal neighbors as can be seen in Figure 3. This indicates a systematic error of about
two microns in the extraction of the widths with the box method. Including this error has a
negligible impact on the results of the ﬁt, increasing the statistical errors by less than 10%. For
all these variations, the change in the central values of the beam parameters from the standard
procedure is taken as the systematic eﬀect. The combined eﬀects of these variations result in
a systematic error of ±460 µm on β∗

y , ±0.0019 µm on ǫy and ±200 µm on σz.

10

In conclusion, we use a new box technique to measure the size of the luminous region of
CESR at the CLEO interaction region. This new method takes advantage of the hit resolution
in the CLEO II.V silicon vertex detector and the well understood CLEO charged particle
tracking system in e+e− → µ+µ− events to precisely measure the size of the luminous region.
The technique has a resolution of 25.5 ± 2.0 µm which we extract from a ﬁt to the data. The
excellent resolution of the box technique, combined with the large size of the CLEO II.V data
set, allows us to make a clear observation of the hourglass eﬀect, the increase in the size of the
luminous region away from the focal point. The technique leads to measurement of the CESR
beam parameters:

β∗
y = (15700 ± 140 ± 460) µm,
ǫy = (0.0060 ± 0.0045 ± 0.0019) µm,
σz = (19290 ± 40 ± 200) µm.

where the ﬁrst error is statistical and the second is systematic, in a simultaneous ﬁt of the
vertical width of the luminous region as a function of the longitudinal position and of the lon-
gitudinal distribution of the luminosity. Note that these measurements imply that the vertical
width of the CESR beam at the CLEO collision point is 6.9 ± 2.8 µm. These measurement are
in good agreement with the expectations of the theoretical CESR lattice taking into account the
dynamic eﬀects caused by the non-zero bunch current. This technique provides a non-invasive
way to measure beam parameters at the collision point, but it requires the comparatively rare
e+e− → µ+µ− events and a well understood detector tracking system.

Abstract

Spin dependencies of the intensity and polarization of the synchrotron radiation of the
longitudinally polarized particle performing uniform circular motion in the magnetic ﬁeld
are investigated.

As it is well known, the synchrotron radiation (SR) of the polarized particle contains a
contribution due to the spin. Quantum mechanical theory of the spin dependence of the
characteristics of the SR from polarized electron was developed by Sokolov and Ternov [1].
In [2] was suggested, that the spin dependence of the SR may be used to measure the degree
of the beam transverse polarization. In [3] a method to measure the degree of the beam
longitudinal polarization using SR was proposed. All estimations in these papers were based
on the quantum electrodynamics .

Note, that as the spin of the particle is of the order of the Planck constant ¯h, the
contribution of the spin in the characteristics of the SR to the ﬁrst order of ¯h is of classical
nature. The semiclassical theory of the SR was developed in [4], however they did not
consider the case of longitudinal polarization of the electrons.

On the other hand, it is well known, that the spin of the electron can be described by
Grassmann variables already at the ”classical” level in pseudoclassical theory of relativistic
spinning particle (after quantization this theory results in a Dirac theory of the electron)
The consistent description of the spin in external ﬁelds using Grassmann variables already
at the classical level allows to investigate spin eﬀects in radiation processes using classical
equations of motion.

Lienard-Wiechert potentials for the relativistic spinning particle with anomalous mag-
In the latter the
netic moment in the pseudoclassical approach were constructed in [5].
general expressions for the Lienard-Wiechert potentials were used for investigation of some
speciﬁc cases of the motion of the spinning particle. In particular, the spin dependencies of
intensity and the polarization of the SR of the transversely polarized particle performing uni-
form circular motion were investigated. It is important to stress, that within our approach
the evaluation of the formulae, describing the spin dependence of the measurable character-
istics of the relativistic particle radiation is much easier, than in quantum electrodynamics.

In this paper general expressions obtained in [5] will be used for investigation of the
spin dependencies of the intensity and polarization of the SR of the longitudinally polarized
particle performing uniform circular motion in the magnetic ﬁeld.

Pseudoclassical theory of the interaction of the relativistic spinning particle with anoma-
lous magnetic moment (AMM) with electromagnetic ﬁeld is a sample of the constrained
theories. Acting in the standard way, when additional constraints are introduced into the
theory for complete ﬁxation of the gauges and keeping only terms up to second order in
Grassmann variables (which is equivalent to keeping only terms, which are of the ﬁrst order
in spin), we obtain for the potentials of the electromagnetic ﬁeld Aµ the equation (for details
see [5])

✷Aµ = jµ,

where jµ is given by the expression

jµ(y) = g

dτ ˙xµδ(x(τ )

Here y is observer’s coordinate, g is the charge, xµ -the coordinate of the particle, the overdote
denotes the diﬀerentiation over τ along the trajectory, pµν is the tensor of the dipole moment
of the particle.

As it was done in [5], here also the physical constraints ﬁxing the gauges of the theory

will be chosen in the form

∂µAµ = 0,

= 1,

qµ = pµν

= 0.

The second relation in (3) means that the parameter τ becomes a proper time of the particle,
while the third relations corresponds to the fact, that the electric dipole moment of the
particle qµ is equal to zero, as it should be for a point particle.

The ﬁrst summand in (2) corresponds to the current of the particle without a dipole
moment and the second term corresponds to the contribution to the current of the dipole
moment of the spinning particle. In the chosen gauge for the theory of the particle without
AMM pµν is given by the expression [5]:

m2 εµνλσW λ ·

Here W µ denotes the pseudoclassical analog of the Pauli- Lubansky vector, which is con-
nected with the vector of the particle spin in the particle rest frame by the relation

In formulae (6) the ﬁrst term corresponds to the contribution of the charge of the particle,

the second -to the contribution of the dipole moment.

Consider now the case of the longitudinally polarized particle (~v

~S) moving in the homo-
geneous magnetic ﬁeld ~B. As it is well known, the angular velocity of the particle without
anomalous magnetic moment in this case is equal to the spin precession angular velocity and
the chirality of the particle doesn’t change during its motion. Then we have the relation

we ﬁnd for the asymmetry of the SR into upper (up) and down (down) hemispheres the

In ultrarelativistic case we have

Now taking into account that S = 1/2, the relation ωmγ = gB and introducing the

Shwinger ﬁeld H0 = m2/g = 4.41

109T , we can rewrite the last equation in the form

For LEP energies of E = 45Gev wiggler magnetic ﬁelds B = 2T we ﬁnd δ = 0, 38
which coincides with the calculations based on the quantum electrodynamics [3]

To investigate the characteristics of the polarization of
SR we resolve (following [7]) the electric ﬁeld strength ~Erad

Abstract

A high-intensity hyperon beam was constructed at CERN to deliver Σ− to experiment WA89 at the
Omega facility and operated from 1989 to 1994. The setup allowed rapid changeover between hyperon
and conventional hadron beam conﬁgurations. The beam provided a Σ− ﬂux of 1.4 × 105 per burst at
mean momenta between 330 and 345 GeV/c produced by about 3 × 1010 protons of 450 GeV/c . At the
experiment target the beam had a Σ−/π− ratio close to 0.4 and a size of 1.6 × 3.7 cm2. The beam particle
trajectories and their momenta were measured with a scintillating ﬁbre hodoscope in the beam channel and a
silicon microstrip detector at the exit of the channel. A fast transition radiation detector was used to identify
the pion component of the beam.

Our present experimental knowledge of the properties and interactions of hyperons comes mainly from

by very short lengths of order 10m, which represent a compromise between the need for adequate shielding
between the primary hyperon production target and the experimental apparatus and the need to reduce decay
losses of the hyperons passing along the beam line. At a momentum of 100 GeV/c, the hyperon decay
lengths vary from 7.1m for Λ to 1.5m for Ω−, which leads to severe reductions of the hyperon ﬂuxes
available for experiments. This has induced a continuous quest for higher hyperon beam momenta, which
started at about 25 GeV/c at the Brookhaven AGS and the CERN PS in the early seventies. The advent
of the super proton synchrotrons at CERN and at FERMILAB in the mid-seventies led to the immediate
construction of new hyperon beam lines to exploit the newly available high energies.

At CERN, a charged hyperon beam with momenta between 70 and 135 GeV/c was operated between
1976 and 1982 in the CERN West Hall. It achieved ﬂuxes of 12,000 Σ−, 400 Ξ− and 10 Ω− per beam pulse,
all of which were successfully used in experiments. For reviews of these activities see [1] and [2].

The quest for higher Σ− ﬂuxes then led to the construction of a new hyperon beam line at CERN, capable
of delivering in excess of 105 Σ− per beam pulse at 340 GeV/c to the Omega spectrometer facility in the
West Hall. The beam was brought into operation in 1989-90 and was used for physics runs in 1991, 1993
and 1994. The design and operation of the beam are the subject of this article.

At FERMILAB the development of hyperon beams culminated in a 600 GeV/c beam delivering Σ− to

the SELEX experiment in 1997 [3].

2 Design considerations

2.1 Boundary conditions

Budget and manpower restrictions led to the decision to base the hyperon beam experiment WA89 on the
existing Omega spectrometer facility in the CERN West Area [4], which was used by several different
experiments each year. This imposed quite severe restrictions on the design of the beam, which are listed
below:

• The Omega spectrometer was situated at the end of the H1 beam line in the West Area. H1 is a high
energy hadron/electron beam used by a number of different experiments. The new hyperon beam
had to be designed allowing for a short changeover time between the different experiments and the
different modes of operating H1.

• In addition to the H1 beam there are ﬁve more beams in the West Area complex operating at the same
time. A hyperon beam always implies dumping a large number of protons close to the experiment,
which creates an unavoidable muon background in the experimental hall. It was mandatory to reduce
the muon ﬂux to the neighbouring experiments as much as possible.

• The West Area, where the Omega spectrometer was located, is an open unshielded hall .

It was
necessary to cover more than 100 m of the H1 beam and in particular the surroundings of the hyperon
production target with shielding. The maximum amount of shielding that could be installed without
interfering too much with existing installations limited the proton ﬂux to 5 × 1010 protons per pulse
thereby imposing a limit on the intensity of the hyperon beam.

1

• Economically it was inconceivable to build any new beam line magnets and we thus had to rely upon

those magnetic elements being available.

2.2 Basic design

The conditions listed above left little freedom in the basic design [5]. The ﬁrst condition made a wobbling
conﬁguration a natural choice in order to preserve the direction of the H1 line and not to be forced to move
the Omega spectrometer. The second condition suggested a bending of the beam in the vertical plane in order
not to sweep the muons horizontally into other beam lines. Condition three together with the wanted Σ−
ﬂux ﬁxed the acceptance of the hyperon channel. The fourth condition limited the bending power available
for the beam, the strongest bending magnets available being three H-type magnets, 3.6 meters long and each
with a maximum ﬁeld of 2.4 T.

At an early stage it was decided not to use any quadrupoles. This decision was dictated by space

limitations and by the loss of intensity due to an increased beam length.

The choice of the beam momentum was a compromise between conﬂicting requirements. On the one
hand, the Σ−/π− production ratio increases rapidly with the ratio of the hyperon beam momentum pY
and the primary proton momentum, xF ≈pY /pp with pp = 450 GeV/c , and the Σ− decay losses are
reduced by increasing pY . On the other hand, the Σ− production cross section decreases rapidly with xF as
σ ∝ (1 − xF)3. The limits on the primary proton ﬂux mentioned above led us to the choice of pc = 355
GeV/c for the momentum on the central trajectory of the collimator, which corresponds to xF = 0.8.

Fig. 1 shows the basic design of the beam line. The 450 GeV/c protons are incident from the left and
bent down 7 mrad before interacting in the production target. Downstream of the target there were three 2.4
T magnets all ﬁlled with brass and tungsten collimators. A channel with small transverse dimensions was
embedded in the tungsten deﬁning the passage of the beam. The ﬁrst magnet contained the dump region
discussed below. The momentum spread of the beam was deﬁned by the channel in the second magnet. The
third magnet bent the beam back onto the geometrical axis of the Omega spectrometer.

2.3 Flux calculations
The Σ− ﬂux of the beam was estimated using the known π−-ﬂux and measured values of the Σ−/π−ratio
as a function of xF (see Fig. 2). For the π− ﬂux we used measurements in the H1 and H8 beams both
made at xF = 0.8. As the momentum bite of the beam is quite large the xF dependence of the π− ﬂux
also enters into the ﬂux calculation. Here we assumed an xF-dependence of the form (1 − xF)4. The
result of the ﬂux calculation as a function of the central momentum of the channel is shown in Fig. 3. The
basic design is compared with a solution without wobbling. Also shown in ﬁgure 3 is the gain that would
have been achieved with 3.0 T magnets had they been available. With these stronger magnets the required
momentum spread of δp/p = 15% (FWHM) would have allowed for a larger angular acceptance of the
magnetic channel and therefore an increased ﬂux. This increase in ﬂux is also seen in ﬁg. 3. At the chosen
value of the central momentum, pc = 355 GeV/c , the calculated Σ−/π− ratio was somewhat below 1. The
design parameters of the beam are given in table 1.

3 Layout

3.1 Proton beam

The primary proton beam of the SPS with an energy of 450 GeV/c was extracted to the West Area in a slow
extraction mode with a spill duration of 2.6 s and a cycle time of 14.4 s. The intensity was typically a few
times 1012 protons per spill. A ﬁrst intensity attenuation of the primary beam was provided by a production

2

target (T1). This 500 mm long Be target produced secondaries for the neighbouring H3 beam. A further
reduction in intensity by roughly a factor 10 was obtained by a ﬁxed hole collimator 20 m downstream of
the T1 target. This collimator consisted of 4 iron blocks with transverse dimensions of 80 cm × 120 cm and
with a length of 40 cm each in the direction of the beam. The blocks were equipped with tungsten inserts
having small ”pinholes” of diameter 3.3 mm. The ﬁne tuning of the intensity was achieved by a movable
four-jaw collimator located 35 m further downstream. It should be pointed out that the T1 target and the
subsequent collimators were located in the horizontal plane of the accelerator ring i.e. some 20 m below the
surface. This means that the muon background coming from the proton beam collimation is negligible at
the surface, where the hyperon beam and the experiment were located.

The distance between the T1 target and the hyperon production target was approximately 800 meters.
The protons were transported over this distance via the H1 beam line. This was a general purpose, high
energy and high resolution beam (for details see [6] ). The last 100 meters of the beam were modiﬁed in
order to make space for the hyperon beam upstream of the Omega spectrometer.

The H1 beam line is equipped with MWPCs and scintillator ﬁlament scanners normally used for beam
tuning . Obviously, those detectors could not be used for beam intensities of several 1010 protons per pulse.
In order to tune the proton beam, attenuators consisting of 120 cm Be, i.e three interaction lengths, could
be introduced just downstream of the T1 target. Together with the abovementioned four-jaw collimator this
allowed to reduce the intensity down to the range of 107 protons per pulse suitable for tuning . Once the
beam was tuned the absorbers were taken away and the collimators opened to obtain the full proton intensity
on the hyperon production target. Several types of secondary emission monitors were installed just in front
of the target in order to measure and monitor the proton ﬂux and the position of the proton beam on the
target. Fig. 4.a and 4.b show the horizontal and vertical proﬁles of the proton beam as measured with one
of the secondary emission monitors just upstream of the target. The horizontal and vertical spot sizes were
250µm and 450µm, respectively (standard deviation). The divergence of the proton beam at the target was
about 0.1 mrad horizontally and vertically.

3.2 Target choice

The target consisted of four Be rods each 100 mm long and 2 mm in diameter. The rods were suspended on
thin aluminium foils (25µm) at each end. The target was motorized and could be moved in two orthogonal
directions in a plane transverse to the beam. There is an interest to keep the diameter of the target as
small as possible as long as the proton beam is well inside the target diameter. This minimizes secondary
interactions which create low energy pions subsequently decaying into muons. The proton beam was well
contained within the diameter of the target as can be seen from ﬁgures 4.a and 4.b . Beryllium was chosen
as target material because the total inelastic cross section increases faster with A than the leading particle
cross section. This means that, per interacting proton, the fraction of hyperons is largest for low A targets.

3.3 Magnetic channel

Fig. 5 shows the shape of the magnetic channel in both the bend and non-bend plane. Note that the horizontal
axis is in meters and the vertical in cm. The channel is embedded in tungsten. Tungsten is chosen due to its
very short interaction length thus stopping as many particles as possible before the decay.

The basic shape in both planes is a wedge opening towards the exit. Some tolerance has been added to

take into account possible misalignments between successive magnets.

The shape of the ﬁrst part of the channel is designed trying to minimise the muon background that
originates from secondary pions and kaons created in the production target and decaying into muons before
being absorbed in the walls of the channel. It turns out that the lateral dimensions are of small importance
and what really matters is the longitudinal distance between the target and the dump. The distance can

3

however not be too small in order to ensure the necessary lateral separation between the Σ−-beam and the
protons at the point where they are dumped. Taking this into account the distance was chosen to be 2.5 m.

In the more downstream part of the vertical section ”pockets” have been added. The purpose of these
pockets is to diminish the number of interactions in the walls and to trap part of the showers in the tungsten.
There is a disadvantage with the wobbling conﬁguration of the beam as can be seen from the shape of
the channel in the bend plane. Neutral particles can reach the exit of the channel from points far upstream in
the channel. The geometry actually allows neutrals to escape from the channel from interactions in the walls
starting at a distance of only 3.5 m from the production target. A local photon background was observed in
the experiment at a place corresponding to an angle of 7 mrad above the beam. As can be seen from Fig. 5
this is consistent with the geometry of the channel. To conﬁrm that this neutral background originates from
the upstream part of the channel, 2 radiation lengths of lead were introduced between the second and the
third magnets. This reduced the background by a factor 2-3. Moreover, if the production target is removed,
the background disappears completely, showing that the background does not originate from the dump.

After the ﬁrst beam period in 1998-90 the shape of the channel was partially modiﬁed to diminish this
neutral background. The modiﬁcations are indicated in ﬁg. 5. The second pocket was moved upstream
and the walls were shaped in such a way that neutral particles from the target can not reach the upstream
wall of the pocket which is seen by the exit and that the downstream part where neutral particles may hit
the channel wall can not be seen from the exit. The point where the protons are dumped was also moved
slightly upstream in order to preserve the distance between the dump and the second pocket to avoid any
leakage into the pocket. The separation of the proton beam and the Σ−-beam at the dump was in this way
reduced from 8 mm to 6 mm.

Fig. 6 shows a transversal cross section of the bending magnets. The pole gaps were ﬁlled with brass
and tungsten collimators as mentioned previously. Each magnet had a ﬁxed part and a removable part of
inserts. The ﬁxed part was made of brass for the two downstream magnets and of tungsten for the most
upstream magnet. The removable part consisted of 90 tungsten block totally (30/magnet) with each block
having its machined rectangular hole. The dimension of those blocks were 13 cm in the direction of the
beam and 3.5 × 18 cm2 transverse to the beam.

3.4 Detection and identiﬁcation of beam particles

The beam momentum was measured with three hodoscopes, namely one scintillating ﬁbre hodoscope placed
before the last bending magnet and two sets of µ-strip silicon detectors located at two positions downstream
of the magnetic channel (ﬁgure 1) A scintillating ﬁbre hodoscope was chosen to allow the measurement
of the particle position in the bending plane (z) with 250/p(12)µm accuracy in the area of strong stray
magnetic ﬁeld and in the strong radiation environment of the magnetic channel.

The hodoscope was constructed of scintillating ﬁbres (Kuraray SCSF-38) with rectangular cross section
(1 x 0.5 mm2). The ﬁbres were covered by a 55 µm thick cladding to which a white pigment was mixed to
prevent crosstalk. Three ﬁbres were put together to form one channel (3 × 0.5 mm2, ﬁgure 7). These three
were glued to one clear ﬁbre (1.5 mm × 1.5 mm × 1 m) as light guide which transmitted the light to one
pixel of a 64-channel photo-multiplier. The channels were arranged in two rows which were displaced by
half a ﬁbre width (0.25 mm). The hodoscope had a total of 64 channels, 32 in each row. A valid hit was a
coincidence between two ﬁbres from each row. To prevent crosstalk at the tube causing wrong coincidences,
neighbouring ﬁbres were distributed over the 64 channels of the PM. Two such hodoscopes were used to
obtain full efﬁciency.

At the exit of the beam channel the beam had to pass a hole of 5 × 5 cm2 deﬁned by a veto counter

consisting of 2 cm lead sheets and 5 mm scintillator which was used to suppress the beam halo.

To reject high momentum π− in the beam at an early stage of the trigger a fast transition radiation
detector (TRD) was placed approximately 1 m downstream of the veto counter. This detector is described

4

in detail in [9]. Two scintillators each with an active area of 3.5 × 3.5 cm 2 in coincidence placed in front of
the TRD and the experiments target were used to trigger on beam particles.

The trajectory of the beam particle in front of the experimental target was measured by a set of 8 high
resolution silicon microstrip detectors with an active area of 5.1 × 5.1 cm2 and with a pitch of 50 µm. A set
of 4 planes was placed in front of the TRD detector, 4 planes were placed behind the TRD directly in front
of the experiment target. The detectors measured in two orthogonal directions. The lower part of Figure 8
shows the setup around the experiment target.

Particles emerging from the interaction were detected in the WA89 spectrometer shown in the upper part
of ﬁgure 8. The secondary particles close to the interaction point were detected by 20 silicon microstrip
planes with 25 and 50µm pitch. Two scintillators (3.5 × 3.5 cm 2 each) were placed in the middle of the
vertex detector to measure the multiplicity of particles coming from the interaction. These detectors were
used in the trigger.

Positioning the target about 14 m upstream of the centre of the Ω-spectrometer provided a 10 m long
decay area for short-living strange particles. The products of these decays along with the particles coming
directly from the target were detected by 40 planes of drift chambers with a spatial resolution of about
300 µm. Special MWPC chambers (20 planes with 1mm wire spacing) were used in the central region of
high particle ﬂuxes. In order to improve the track matching between the target region and the decay region
three sets of 4 MWPCs each with a pitch of 1 mm were installed about 2 m behind the target.

The particle momenta were measured by the Ω-spectrometer consisting of a super-conducting magnet
with a ﬁeld integral of 7.5 Tm and a tracking detector consisting of 45 MWPC planes inside the ﬁeld
area and 12 drift chamber planes at the exit of the magnet. The momentum resolution was σ(p)/p2 ≈
10−4 (GeV/c)−1.

Charged particles were identiﬁed using a ring imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector . It had a threshold
of γ = 42 and provided π/p separation up to about 150 GeV/c. Downstream of the RICH a lead glass elec-
tromagnetic calorimeter was positioned for photon and electron detection . This calorimeter was followed
by a hadron calorimeter. For a more detailed description see [10] and references therein.

4 Beam distributions

Figures 9.c and 9.d show the beam proﬁle in horizontal (y) and vertical (z) direction at the position of the
experiment target about 3 m from the exit of the beam channel. The beam had a width of 1.6 cm in y and
a width of 3.7 cm in z direction. The shape of the beam proﬁle in z reﬂects the momentum distribution of
the beam. The beam proﬁle in the non bending plane is a result of the proﬁle of the proton beam and of the
position of the beryllium target.

Figure 9a and b show the correlations between the beam particle impact point and its angle in the bending
and non bending plane. All particle trajectories in the narrow bands in ﬁgure 9 point back to the production
target. Particles outside the correlation bands are π− from Σ− decays, particles elastically scattered in
the beam channel or muons. The distribution in ﬁgures 9a and 9.b were used to measure the amount of
background in the beam from these sources (see below).

The momentum distribution of the beam was measured with the Ω spectrometer. For this measurement
it was required that exactly one track was detected in the spectrometer to reject events with interactions.
The momentum measurement for these non-interacting events was subsequently used to calibrate the beam
hodoscope to be able to measure the beam particle momenta also for events where the Σ− interacted in the
target. The momentum distribution of beam particles for the 1994 data taking period is shown in ﬁgure
10. The solid line corresponds to the value measured by the beam hodoscope. The dashed line shows the
momentum measurement in the spectrometer. This spectrum shows an additional component below 150
GeV/c stemming from the decays Σ−→nπ−. The measurement of the beam momentum gave average

5

momenta of 345 GeV/c for the 1993 beam time and 330 GeV/c for the beam time in 1994 and a width of
∆p/p = 18% (FWHM) which is close to the beam line design value of ∆p/p = 15%.

5 Beam composition

5.1 Σ− identiﬁcation
In the TRD high momentum π− were identiﬁed by their characteristic transition radiation, which was de-
tected in ten double planes of multiwire proportional chambers. If three of the ten planes gave a signal
above threshold the beam particle was identiﬁed as a high momentum pion and the event was subsequently
rejected in the experiment trigger. The pulse height of each chamber was recorded for monitoring purposes
and to allow a more detailed ofﬂine analysis at a later stage. Ofﬂine the pulse height information from the
TRD chambers along the track measured in the the microstrip detectors was used to calculate a likelihood
for the different particle hypotheses. The distribution of likelihoods for beam particles before and after the
TRD decision is shown in ﬁg. 11. From a two-component ﬁt to the distribution of likelihoods before the
TRD decision (ﬁg 11.a) a Σ−/π− ratio of 0.38 ± 0.04 at the position of the TRD can be deduced, which
is in very good agreement with the design value of the beam line. With the help of the TRD information
the pion component for events in the experiment trigger was reduced to a Σ−/π− ratio of 10 ± 1 with a Σ−
detection efﬁciency of 82 ± 1% By a cut on the TRD likelihood in the ofﬂine analysis a Σ− purity of 98.5
% was achieved while more than 95 % of the Σ− identiﬁed online were retained.

5.2 Ξ− in the beam
To measure the amount of Ξ− in the beam, a sample of events with beam particles passing through the target
without interaction was analysed. In this data sample we identiﬁed Σ− and Ξ− decays by the observation
of decay kinks between the incoming beam particle and a negative particle detected in the spectrometer
from the decays Σ− → nπ− and Ξ− → Λπ−, respectively. The decay lengths of Σ− and Ξ− at the same
momentum differ by only 1% and therefore no acceptance or efﬁciency corrections are needed for a given
ﬁducial volume to evaluate the Ξ− / Σ− ratio.

In part a) of ﬁg. 12 the expected correlation (generated with the GEANT Monte Carlo) between momen-
tum and kink angle for Σ− and Ξ− decays is shown. The experimental data for the correlation are displayed
in ﬁg. 12b. A second band originating from Ξ− decays can be discerned there. For a quantitative analysis
we projected this distribution along the angle-momentum correlation marked by the dashed and solid lines.
This projection is shown by the solid histogram in part c) of ﬁg. 12. Besides the dominating peak from Σ−
decays, a well separated maximum corresponding to Ξ− decays can be identiﬁed. The observed distribution
can be reproduced by Monte Carlo simulations assuming a Ξ− contribution of (1.3 ± 0.1)% relative to the
number of Σ− (see cross-hatched histogram in ﬁg. 12.c). This ratio is in good agreement with the numbers
given in [8].

5.3 Ω− and K− in the beam
The production of Ω− is expected to be even more suppressed than the production of Ξ− due to the additional
In ﬁgure 12b a sizeable contribution of Ω− would be visible in a band above the
unit of strangeness.
correlation for Σ− in the momentum range of 70-160 GeV/c . In this region of the plot no Ω− can be
identiﬁed above the background. The expected Ω−/Ξ− ratio at the channel exit calculated from the numbers
given in [8] is 2 × 10−3 which is below the sensitivity of the measurement presented in ﬁgure 12.

The K− component of the beam can be estimated on the basis of the K− to π− production ratio, which
was measured to be (1.15 ± 0.02)% [11] in 300 GeV/c p-Be collisions . Since the K− are below the TRD

6

threshold they were not rejected by this detector. From the K−/π− ratio at production we deduce that there
was a 2.1% admixture of K− in the beam after the online rejection of the high-momentum π− component.

5.4 Muon halo

There are two different origins of the muon background. One part comes from showers created by the
protons being dumped in the tungsten. The second part is due to secondary pions and kaons created in the
production target which decay into muons before being absorbed in the walls of the channel. The ﬁrst kind
of muon background is minimized by choosing a very dense material with a very short interaction length,
such as tungsten. The second contribution depends on the geometry of the beginning of the channel as
discussed in section 3.3. To obtain a rough idea of the muon background we have used the Monte-Carlo
program HALO [12]. This program generates parent particles decaying into muons and the muons are then
tracked through the coils and yokes of the different magnets. The result of this calculation is shown in
table 2, where muon densities for 2 × 1010 protons are given at the entrance to the Omega spectrometer.
Contributions from the dump and from the target have been separated. It can be seen that at the beam axis
we expect about 2 × 105 muons/m2 and that the dominating part comes from secondaries from the target.

The level of the muon background was measured with scintillator hodoscopes located a couple of meters
downstream of the exit of the Omega spectrometer. About 2 × 105 muons/m2 per pulse were measured, in
good agreement with the calculations. Taking out the production target reduced this rate by a factor of 2.5,
conﬁrming the trends found in the calculations.

5.5 Backgrounds in the beam

The total amount of background in the beam can be estimated from the plots in ﬁgure 9. In this plots about
21 % of all measured particle trajectories do not fall into the angle-impact correlation which is given for
particles coming from the production target. Of this 21 % about half could be assigned to π− from Σ−
decays as shown by a Monte Carlo simulation of the beam line. The rest corresponds to muons and particles
elastically scattered in the collimators.

To measure the effect of the veto counter data were taken in a special run where the veto counter was
not included in the experiment trigger. Removing the veto counter resulted in an increase of 5 % of the
multiplicity dependent part of the trigger rate. This increase was caused by additional particles crossing the
apparatus together with the particles produced in the experiment target causing larger pulse heights in the
multiplicity counters.

Interactions from Pions and Neutrons

5.6
With the given beam composition it was possible to obtain in addition to the events with Σ− induced inter-
actions data samples on interactions induced by π− and neutrons:

To obtain a clean sample of events with pion interaction data was taken with an inverted TRD decision
for a small fraction of the runing time. In this data sample the Σ−component of the beam was suppressed
online by the TRD to a level below 2 %.

For Σ− decaying upstream of the centre of the last bending magnet the decay pion fell in the acceptance
of the beam trigger counters. Since the momentum of the decay pion is below 150 GeV/c this events were
not rejected by the TRD and were identiﬁed with the angle-impact correlation as mentioned above. In some
fraction of this events however an interaction was induced by the decay neutron. It was possible to isolate
a clean sample of such events by requiring that the beam particle trajectory was outside the angle-impact
correlation and not pointing to the reconstructed interaction vertex. Additionaly it was required that the pion
track could be followed into the spectrometer and had a momentum below 150 GeV/c.

7

Neutron and π− induced interactions were used as control data sets to be able to compare to other

experiments using these beams types [10].

6 Effect of the vertical target position

The vertical target position determined the position of the produced particles at the entrance of the magnetic
channel and therefore the curvature of the central trajectory passing through the collimators of the magnetic
channel. By moving the target up and down it was hence possible to tune the average beam momentum.
For each given target position the proton beam could be steered onto the production target by means of a
trimmer magnet.

The target position with maximum channel transmission was given by the geometrical acceptance of the
collimator system. Since the Σ−/π− production ratio is strongly dependent on the average beam momentum
this target steering also had an impact on the Σ− content of the beam.

To ﬁnd an optimal point of operation the target was moved ± 0.4 cm relative to its nominal zero position
and the corresponding beam momenta and particle ﬂuxes were measured. Figure 13 shows the results of
these measurements. The average particle momentum varied from 310 to 360 GeV/c for this range of target
positions (ﬁg 13.a). The ﬂux variation is shown in ﬁgure 13.b . At maximum transmission the ﬂux was
5 × 105 particles (Σ− and π− ) for 3.0 × 1010 incident protons. In 1993 the beam was operated with the
target at position -0.05 which gave an average momentum of 345 GeV/c, a Σ−/π− ratio of 0.4 and a ﬂux of
1.38 × 105 Σ− particles at the channel exit.

7 Conclusions

A high-intensity double-bend hyperon beam was successfully operated at momenta between 330 and 345
GeV/c delivering 1.4 × 105 Σ− to experiment WA89 in the CERN West Area. At the experiment target
3 m downstream of the channel exit the beam had a Σ−/π− ratio of 0.38 ± 0.04 and a size of 1.6 × 3.7
cm2. The Ξ−/Σ− component of the beam was measured to be 1.3 ± 0.1 % in good agreement with previous
measurements. The muon and neutral backgrounds were substantially reduced by a careful design of the
proton beam dump area and the shape of the collimators. By an adjustment of the vertical target position it
was possible to tune the beam momentum, the particle ﬂux and the Σ−/π−ratio to an optimal value.

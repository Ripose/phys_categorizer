1 Problem

A vacuum photodiode is constructed in the form of a parallel plate capacitor with plate
separation d. A battery maintains constant potential V between the plates. A short laser
pulse illuminates that cathode at time t = 0 with energy suﬃcient to liberate all of the
surface charge density. This charge moves across the capacitor gap as a sheet until it is
collected at the anode at time T . Then another laser pulse strikes the cathode, and the cycle
repeats.

Estimate the average current density hji that ﬂows onto the anode from the battery,
ignoring the recharing of the cathode as the charge sheet moves away. Then calculate the
current density and its time average when this eﬀect is included.

Compare with Child’s Law for steady current ﬂow.
You may suppose that the laser photon energy is equal to the work function of the

cathode, so the electrons leave the cathode with zero velocity.

2 Solution

The initial electric ﬁeld in the capacitor is E = −V /dˆx, where the x axis points from the
cathode at x = 0 to the anode. The initial surface charge density on the cathode is (in
Gaussian units)

The laser liberates this charge density at t = 0.

The average current density that ﬂows onto the anode from the battery is

σ = E/4π = −V /4πd.

where T is the transit time of the charge across the gap d. We ﬁrst estimate T by ignoring
the eﬀect of the recharging of the cathode as the charge sheet moves away from it. In this
approximation, the ﬁeld on the charge sheet is always E = −V /d, so the acceleration of an
electron is a = −eD/m = eV /dm, where e and m are the magnitudes of the charge and

mass of the electron, respectively. The time to travel distance d is T = q2d/a = q2d2m/eV .

We now make a detailed calculation, including the eﬀect of the recharging of the cathode,

which will reduce the average current density somewhat.

At some time t, the charge sheet is at distance x(t) from the cathode, and the anode
and cathode have charge densities σA and σC, respectively. All the ﬁeld lines that leave the
anode terminate on either the charge sheet or on the cathode, so

σ + σC = −σA,

(5)

where σA and σC are the charge densities on the anode and cathode, respectively. The the
electric ﬁeld strength in the region I between the anode and the charge sheet is

EI = −4πσA,

and that in region II between the charge sheet and the cathode is

The voltage between the capacitor plates is therefore,

EII = 4πσC.

V = −EI (d − x) − EIIx = 4πσAd − V

using (1) and (5-7), and taking the cathode to be at ground potential. Thus,

σA =

σC = −

and the current density ﬂowing onto the anode is

j(t) = ˙σA =

4πd2 .

This diﬀers from the average current density (2) in that ˙x/d 6= T , since ˙x varies with time.
To ﬁnd the velocity ˙x of the charge sheet, we consider the force on it, which is due to the

ﬁeld set up by charge densities on the anode and cathode,

Eon σ = 2π(−σA + σC) = −

With the initial conditions that the electrons start from rest, x(0) = 0 = ˙x(0), we readily
ﬁnd that

x(t) =

Abstract

A new algorithm for calculating the spin tune and the nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn-axis for circular accelerators is
presented. The method resembles the one employed in the existing program code SODOM
in that one-turn numerical spin maps at equally spaced orbit angle variables are used but
it is more eﬃcient than the latter. Furthermore, it is applicable at large openning angles
of the nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn-axis, whereas the existing SODOM only converges for small angles.

1 Introduction

The spin tune, the spin precession frequency divided by the orbit revolution frequency, is
an important parameter in the description of spin motion in circular accelerators. When
a particle is on the closed orbit, the deﬁnition of the spin tune is obvious;
it is the
spin precession angle over one turn divided by 2π. However, when orbit oscillations are
involved, the deﬁnition of the spin tune becomes more complicated. One needs the concept
of the nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn-axis which was ﬁrst introduced by Derbenev and Kondratenko[1] for radiative
polarization phenomena in electron storage rings.

We assume that we have complete knowledge about the orbit motion, i.e. that we
know the action and angle variables, JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ = (Jx, Jy, Jz) and φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ = (φx, φy, φz), corresponding
to the three degrees of freedom of the orbit motion, which can be in general nonlinear.

A particle with initial coordinates (JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ, φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ) at a machine azimuth θ executes orbit oscil-
θ + 2π), where µµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµ = (µx, µy, µz) is the
lations and comes to (JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ, φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ + µµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµ) after one turn (θ
orbit tune, νννννννννννννννννννννννννννννννννννν, times 2π. The spin motion over one turn can in general be expressed by a
3 rotation matrix R(JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ, φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ, θ). Obviously, it is a periodic function of θ and φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ with period

2π. On the next turn the rotation is expressed by R(JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ, φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ + µµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµ, θ + 2π) = R(JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ, φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ + µµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµ, θ)
which diﬀers from R(JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ, φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ, θ) unless the orbit tunes are integers.

→

A particle on the closed orbit sees the same rotation R0(θ) for every turn. R0(θ)
has eigenvalues 1 and e±iµs0 and the spin tune νs0 is µs0/2π. One can show that µs0 is
independent of θ. The eigenvector belonging to the eigenvalue 1 is denoted by nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn0, i.e.,
R0nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn0 = nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn0. It depends only on θ. A spin parallel to nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn0(θ) remains unchanged after one
turn, and all other spins attached to closed orbit trajectories precess by the angle µs0
around nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn0 during one turn.

The vector nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn is a generalization of nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn0 for particles oﬀ the closed orbit. It is a function

of (JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ, φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ, θ) periodic in φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ and θ and satisﬁes

R(JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ, φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ, θ)nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn(JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ, φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ, θ) = nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn(JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ, φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ + µµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµ, θ).

When JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ = 0, nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn reduces to nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn0. To deﬁne the spin tune for nonzero JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ, we need two more
vectors uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu1 and uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu2 which form an orthonormal basis together with nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn. They are functions
of (JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ, φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ, θ) and periodic in φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ and θ like nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn. The spin tune is deﬁned as the precession angle
in the frame (uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu1, uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu2, nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn) divided by 2π.

The concept of the vector nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn has been playing an important role in the description and
calculation of radiative polarization in electron/positron storage rings since[1]. Recently,
it has also turned out to be useful for proton rings[2].

To calculate the vector nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn several algorithms have been invented. S. Mane[3] developed
a computer code SMILE using a perturbation expansion with respect to the orbit action
variable. The present author suggested a perturbation algorithm using Lie algebra[4] and
Eidelmann and Yakimenko[5] coded a program SPINLIE with (low order) orbit nonlin-
earity. Balandin, Golubeva and Barber[6] also wrote a Lie Algebra code.

The present author considered another method which does not employ a perturbation
expansion and wrote a program SODOM[7]. Heinemann and Hoﬀstaetter[8] use tracking

2

and ‘stroboscopic averaging’ in the code SPRINT. The programs SODOM, SPRINT and
[6] additionally compute the spin tune.

The new method which we are going to describe is based on SODOM.
We shall brieﬂy summarize the SODOM algorithm in the next section and describe

the new method in Sec.3.

2 The SODOM Algorithm

Let us ﬁrst brieﬂy summarize the algorithm employed in SODOM. (See Sec.3 of [7].)
Denote the one-turn SU2 spin transport map starting at a ﬁxed prechosen azimuth θ0 for
particles with initial orbital phase φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ by M(φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ) and the spinor representing the nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn-axis at θ0
by ψ(φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ). (Here, we simply write ψ(φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ) instead of ψ+(φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ) [7]. We also omit the arguments
JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ and θ0 since we shall deal with one set of JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ and consider the one-turn map from the
origin θ0 only.) The fact that nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn is ‘invariant’ means

M(φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ)ψ(φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ) = e−iv(φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ)/2ψ(φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ + µµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµ),

where v(φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ) is a real periodic function. Once a solution (ψ(φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ),v(φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ)) is obtained, we solve
the equation

and deﬁne

Then, Ψ(φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ) satisﬁes

This is simply a matrix eigenvalue equation. Thus, the spin tune comes out as an eigen-
value.

However, obviously, eq.(12) has many eigenvalues. Which one gives the spin tune?
What do the other eiganvalues and eigenvectors mean? In order to answer these questions
let us return to eq.(5) and examine it as an eigenvalue system

M(φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ)Ψ(φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ) = λΨ(φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ + µµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµ)

(13)

Note that this is not a simple 2

Before going further we have to think about subtle problems associated with the ‘2-to-
1’ correspondence between SU2 and SO3. Note that we use 2-component spinors and SU2
2 For example, Ψ = (cos φ, sin φ) is a mild function but leads to ζ = tan φ which is hard to Fourier-

expand.

matrices instead of 3-vectors and SO3 matrices to achieve computational speed and to
minimize storage but not because the particles have spin ¯h/2. The classical spin motion
can be completely described by 3-vectors and SO3 matrices.

What does the periodicity of a spinor with respect to φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ mean? The physical object is
the 3-vector Ψ†σσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσΨ = nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn rather than the spinor Ψ. In this sense a complex phase factor in
Ψ is irrelevant. However, a complex phase factor is still relevant when one constructs the
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu1 and uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu2 axes from Ψ via Ψϕ.

On the other hand, a sign change of Ψ does not cause a change of nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn = Ψ†σσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσΨ nor a

change of uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu1 and uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu2 deﬁned by Ψ†

ϕσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσσΨϕ.

Thus, as the periodicity condition for Ψ with respect to φj (one of the orbit angle
variables), we have to allow both Ψ(φj + 2π) = Ψ(φj) and Ψ(φj + 2π) =
Ψ(φj). Then
with 3 degrees of freedom for orbit motion, we have 8 types of solutions Ψ(φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ) diﬀering by
φj + 2π. In Fourier expansion
their sign change behaviour under the transformation φj →
language, this means that Ψ can be expanded as

When obtaining νs from λ, one ﬁnds an ambiguity only up to an even integer rather
than up to an integer. At ﬁrst sight this is puzzling but it is also due to the ‘2-to-1’
correspondence between SU2 and SO3. Obviously,

deﬁne the spin tune in the interval [0,1) or (-0.5,0.5] and, if the sign of nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn is irrelevant, we
can reduce the interval to [0,0.5].

Thus, we have found that we only need one of the sets of eigenvector and eigenvalue of
eq.(5). All others can be constructed from this. Therefore one can Fourier expand Ψ as in

4 Choice of the Spin Tune

We have shown in the previous section that there are many eigenvalues (spin tunes)
representing the same vector nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn and diﬀerent (uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu1, uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu2) axes. Now, we must ﬁnally decide
which eigenvalue to choose for the spin tune. Theoretically speaking there is no reason
to choose one particular value. As pointed out in [9] spin tune is intrinsically ambiguous
up to a multiple of the orbit tunes. The choice of the spin tune, which is equivalent to a
choice of (uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu1, uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu2), is a matter of convention.

In practice, however, a solution is not desirable if (uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu1, uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu2) is a strong function of φφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφφ.
When one solves the equation by Fourier expansion, the most natural choice is to take
the solution having the largest zero-Fourier harmonic

.

If one plots all the eigenvalues as a function of any parameter (beam energy, betatron
amplitude, etc), one will ﬁnd continuous curves. If one plots the spin tune selected as
just described as a function of these parameters one may occasionally ﬁnd a jump of spin
tune although the whole spectrum content is continuous.

Let us give an example from a test calculation. The test ring consists of 100 FODO
cells, each of which has two thin-lens quadrupole magnets and two bending magnets
ﬁlling the entire space between quadrupoles. The focusing eﬀect of the bending magnets
is ignored. In order to avoid a too high symmetry of the orbit motion, an artiﬁcial phase
advance of 90 degrees in both horizontal and vertical planes is introduced at one point
in the ring. The tunes are νx = 15.3827 and νy = 25.6482. Only the vertical betatron
oscillation is excited. The beam energy is so chosen that νs0 = γa = 1520.72.

Fig.1 shows the eigenvalue (spin tune) spectrum as a function of the betatron action
Jy. Only those with small mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm are plotted. The points linked by a solid line correspond to
the spin tune selected by the criterion mentioned above. As one can see, each eigenvalue
is a continuous function of Jy (A few curves appear broken because not all the eigenvalues

are plotted.) but the selected tune shows a jump at Jy ≈
rad. The spin tune

The minimum of Plim coincides with the point of the spin tune jump.

Figure 1: An example of a spin tune spectrum as a function of betatron action. The
dashed line is the upper limit of polarization Plim.

We have compared the results of our program with SPRINT for the amplitude depen-
dence of the spin tune in the HERA ring. The agreement of the nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn axis and the spin tune
was excellent. Not only the occurrence of spin tune jumps but also their location agree,
which means that taking the largest zero-harmonic and the stroboscopic averaging are
almost equivalent.

5 Truncation of Fourier Series

In numerical calculations one has to truncate the Fourier expansion. There are a few
problems associated with the truncation.

When N values of φ are used (we deal with one degree of freedom for illustration.
The extension to 3 degrees of freedom is obvious.), the range of the harmonics should

be

other values of φ are needed (for example when calculating nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn for arbitary values after the
problem is solved). N must be large enough to ensure that the Fourier components Mm
(actually fm and gm) are small enough outside the region [
The matrix e−imµMm−m′ in eq.(12) is then a (2M +1)

(2M +1) matrix (each element is

On the other hand, one can ﬁll the upper-right and lower-left triangles by treating the
harmonics in a cyclic manner as in a discrete Fourier transformation (i.e. one identiﬁes
the (M + 1)-th harmonic with the (
M)-th.). With this prescription the truncated matrix
becomes exactly unitary even if N is not large enough. The solution with the largest
zero-harmonic does not change much. The appearance of eigenvalues with modulus far
from unity then means that the eigenvalue solver is not accurate.

−

When one adopts the cyclic use of the harmonics, the lemmas [a], [b], [d] and [g] hold
exactly apart from round oﬀ errors, but [c] and [e] (and accordingly [f]) become inaccurate.

6 Conclusion

We have shown that the spin tune can be obtained as an eigenvalue of a matrix which is
created from the one-turn maps calculated by particle tracking. The method is applicable
to any system with linear or nonlinear orbit motion as long as the orbit action variables
exist. The convergence is much better than with perturbation methods and the previous
SODOM algorithm. The computation is very fast because it makes full use of the fact
that the spin motion is linear and that we know the orbit tunes.

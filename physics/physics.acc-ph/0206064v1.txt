The analysis of the EM radiation from a single charge shows that the radiated

power depends on the retarded acceleration of the charge. Therefore for consis-

tency, an accelerated charge, free from the inﬂuence of external forces, should

gradually lose its acceleration, until its total energy is radiated. Calculations

show that the self force of a charge, which compensates for its radiation, is

proportional to the derivative of the acceleration. However, when using this

self force in the equation of motion of the charge, one gets a diverging solution,

for which the acceleration runs away to inﬁnity. This means that there is an

inconsistency in the solution of the single charge problem. However, in the con-

1

struction of the conserved Maxwell charge density, there is implicitly an integral

over the corresponding world line which corresponds to a collection of charged

spacetime events. One may therefore consistently think of the ”self force” as

the force on a charge due to another charge at the retarded position. From

this point of view, the energy is evidently conserved and the radiation process

appears as an absorbing resistance to the feeding source. The purpose of this

work is to learn about the behavior of single charges from the behavior of a

real current, corresponding to the set of charges moving on a world line, and

to study the analog of the self force of a charge associated with the radiation

resistance of a continuum of charges.

Key words: radiation resistance, self force, charges.

1. Introduction

Antennas and EM radiation problems have been extensively discussed in the

literature, and usually have closed form solutions, or at least closed numerically

formulated solutions [1,2]. This means that the behavior of charges which are

part of a real given electrical current is well described.

However, the behavior of single charges has still many open questions [3,4,5].

In the construction of the conserved Maxwell charge density, there is implicitly

an integral [6] over the corresponding world line which corresponds to a col-

lection of charged spacetime events. One may therefore consistently think of

the ”self force” as the force on a charge due to another charge at the retarded

position. In this paper we wish to deduce and extrapolate the behavior of single

charges, from the behavior of a real electrical current. Speciﬁcally, we would like

2

to understand if the ”self” force of a charge, which acts as a radiation damping

force, is an analogy to the radiation resistance, which acts like a power absorber

from the feeding source.

We will use in this paper ǫ0 = 1/(4π); µ0 = 4π; c = 1, and put back the

standard values only where it will be speciﬁcally mentioned.

2. Formulation

We formulate here the following problem:

Figure 1: Short dipole antenna

The antenna is fed by the current source I(t) (at z = 0), which can be ex-

panded in a Fourier series of functions. Therefore, without loss of generality we

may consider the harmonic excitation: I(t) = I0 cos(ωt). At an arbitrary z, the

current will be:

I(z, t) = If (z, t) + Ib(z, t)

(1)

where If , Ib are the current waves which move forwards and backwards, respec-

3

tively, in the z direction, and have the form of:

If,b(z, t) = C1,2 cos ω(t ∓ z + φ1,2)

(2)

where the constants C1,2, φ1,2 must satisfy the boundary conditions of zero cur-

rent at z = ±L/2 and I0cos(ωt) current at z = 0. Those boundary conditions

establish the spatial dependency of the current f (z) so that the current in (1)

may also be written as:

I(z, t) = I0 cos(ωt)f (z), f (0) = 1, f (±L/2) = 0

(1a)

However, these boundary conditions are not important for the work of this pa-

per because we are interested in locally analyzing the behavior of charges. But

we will use the general form of the current, for establishing connections between

the current and microscopic parameters, like speed and acceleration of the single

charges. So we rewrite the current in (1) as:

I(z, t) = C1 cos ω(t − z + φ1) + C2 cos ω(t + z + φ2)

and

ω = 2πf = 2π/λ

(3)

(4)

where f is the frequency of the excitation and ω is the wavelength.

Next we have to calculate the speed of the charges v(z, t). Having a one

dimensional conﬁguration, it will be convenient to deﬁne ρ, the charge density,

as the charge per unit of length. Therefore, to be consistent we have to deﬁne

4

J, the current density, as the current I itself:

J(z, t) = If (z, t) + Ib(z, t) = C1 cos ω(t − z + φ1) + C2 cos ω(t + z + φ2) (5)

∂µJ µ = 0 therefore ∂ρ

∂t + ∂J

∂z = 0

Knowing that:

we calculate:

Therefore:

∂ρ
∂t = ω[−C1 sin ω(t − z + φ1) + C2 sin ω(t + z + φ2)]

ρ = ω R dt[−C1 sin ω(t − z + φ1) + C2 sin ω(t + z + φ2)] =

If (z, t) − Ib(z, t) + ρ0

ρ0 is the integration constant and represents the density of the free electrons

per unit of length in the conductor. As we shall see, ρ0 ≫ |If (z, t) − Ib(z, t)|

therefore If (z, t), Ib(z, t) constitute low amplitude waves moving forward and

backwards, respectively, around the average charge density ρ0.

Knowing the relation J = ρv, we obtain for v(z, t):

v(z, t) = J

ρ = I

ρ = If (z,t)+Ib(z,t)

If (z,t)−Ib(z,t)+ρ0

For any practical purpose ρ0 is the dominant term in the denominator of

(9), since ρ0 ≫ C1,2/c (we insert here the light velocity c). For example, if

C1,2 = 10A, then C1,2/c = 1.87 × 1011 electrons/m. Let’s say our wire has a

5

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

surface of 0.5mm2, so C1,2/c corresponds to 7.5 × 1017 electrons/m3, while the

charge density in copper is 8 × 1028 electrons/m3. So ρ0 is bigger than C1,2/c

by 11 orders of magnitude, and the velocity of the electrons is smaller than c by

11 orders of magnitude, i.e., about 10−4m/sec. We therefore may approximate

the velocity of the charges by:

v(z, t) = 1

ρ0 I(z, t)

(10)

3. Discretization of the continuum

The next step is to discretize the current into charges of magnitude, having a

distanceone from the other, so that, as in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Close-up view of the conductor

We will examine the forces acting on the ”test charge” B (Fig. 2), as a result

of a disturbance produced on charge A.

Before the disturbance occurred, all charges had a constant velocity, and on

each charge, two opposite static forces of magnitude q2/(∆z)2 acted.

A disturbance which occurred at charge A at an earlier time t = −∆t =

−∆z, appears as a disturbance perceived at charge B at t = 0.

The motion of the ”disturbed” charge A, zA(t) can be expanded for t = −∆t,

up to third order, as follows:

zA(−∆t) = zA0 − v∆t + 1

2 a∆t2 − 1

6 ˙a∆t3

where v, a and ˙a are the velocity, acceleration and its derivative, measured at

t = 0. The velocity of the ”disturbed” charge A is:

(11)

(12)

vA(−∆t) = v − a∆t + 1

2 ˙a∆t2

The full distance to zB from the disturbed charge at A must arrive at light

velocity, therefore, ∆z at time −∆t is:

∆z(−∆t) = zB − zA(−∆t) = ∆z0 + v∆t − 1

2 a∆t2 + 1

6 ˙a∆t3 = ∆t

(13)

Formula (13) tells us that the retarded distance equals the time needed to prop-

agate the disturbance, and expands this distance in powers of ∆t, where ∆z0 is

the distance between the charges A and B at t = 0.

The near ﬁeld of a charge is expressed by [4]:

Ez =

q

[Rµvµ]2 RET =

q
[γ∆z(1−vA)]2

,

|−∆t

(14)

where Γ is very close to 1. We will use (12) and (13) for putting the values of

∆z and vA into (14) and get from (13):

7

∆z0 − ∆t(1 − v + 1

2 a∆t − 1

6 ˙a∆t2) = 0

(15)

With the aid of (15), we obtain from (12)

1 − vA(−∆t) = ∆z0

∆t − 1

2 a∆t+ 1

6 ˙a∆t2 + a∆t− 1

2 ˙a∆t2 ≃ 1 + 1

2 a∆t− 1

3 ˙a∆t2 (16)

Here, we have used the approximation ∆z0 ≃ ∆t because the velocity is very

small.

Using this result, ∆z = ∆t and γ ≃ 1 in (14), we get the ﬁeld at charge B,

caused by a disturbance which occurred ∆t earlier at charge A, as

Ez = q( 1

∆t2 − a

∆t + 2

3 ˙a − 1

4 a2)

(17)

The ﬁrst term q/∆t2 is always cancelled by the force of the ”other” neighbor,

as mentioned before, it therefore can be ignored.

The third term is identical to what is considered to be the ﬁeld which creates

the self-force of a charge, but here it was derived as the force on a charge, due

to a disturbance on a neighboring charge. As we shall see, it is the only term

which creates the radiation resistance (which we see is a local phenomenon on

the world line).

we obtain:

We will call the last 3 terms of (17) Edamp, and after replacing ∆t by ∆z,

Edamp = q(− a

(18)

The potential diﬀerence V on a wire segment of length ∆z, resulting from Edamp,

will be denoted as the ”damping” tension (or ”damping” voltage) and is calcu-

8

The magnitude ∆z is according to the discretization deﬁned above, so that

lated by:

V = −Edamp∆z

∆z = q/ρ0

We therefore get from (18), (19) and (20):

Dealing with harmonic excitation, ∂/∂t is like multiplication by ω (up to a 900

phase). So ¨v ∼ ω2v, and ( ˙v)2 ∼ (ωv)2. Having v smaller by 11 orders of

magnitude than light velocity, ˙v2 is completely negligible relative to ¨v.

We therefore may write (21) (after neglecting the ˙v2 term), using (22):

(25)

The constant ratio between ∂2I/∂t2 and I means that the current is ”in phase”

with its second derivative, and therefore the ﬁrst part of ∆P in (24), integrated

over time, represents radiated energy. However, the multiplication of I by ∂I/∂t

has the form of cos ω(t − z + φ) sin ω(t − z + φ) and therefore the second part of

∆P represents a reactive power, which results in zero energy after integrating on

an integer number of time cycles. The reactive power represents power which is

returned to the source each time cycle. We are therefore interested in the ﬁrst

term of ∆P in (24).

Putting (25) into the ﬁrst part of (24) we obtain:

∆P (z) = 2

(26)

In (26) we omitted the time dependence, which is harmonic (see (1a)), and

multiplied by 1

2 which is (1/T ) R

0 cos2(2π/T )tdt. So (26) represents the mean

T

emitted power over a time cycle T = 2π/ω.

Therefore the mean power emitted from the whole wire is:

(28)

The factor 2 is due to P being averaged on a time cycle, and I0 is the ampli-

tude. Now we put back the units: Z0 = 1/(ǫ0c) = pµ0/ǫ0 = 120π would be the

impedance of the free space, if we had used ǫ0 = 1; but we used ǫ0 = 1/4π, so

we have to multiply (28) by Z0 = 120π

4π = 30. We therefore obtain the radiation

resistance:

R = 80π2( L

λ )2(Iav/I0)2Ω

(29)

which is identical to the result in the literature [1,2].

4. Discussion

from (29).

The radiation resistance of two particular cases can be immediately derived

One is a halfwave dipole L = λ/2, for which the boundary conditions give

f (z) = cos(2πz/λ) in (1a). Here we obtain Iav = (2/π)I0, hence R = 80Ω.

The second is an ideal case of very short dipole antenna, in which we suppose

Iav = I0, (as if the boundary conditions were satisﬁed by two discs at the ends of

the wire to act as charge reservoirs). In this case we obtain R = 80π2(L/λ)2Ω.

This result could have been obtained by directly dividing the voltage in the ﬁrst

part of (23) by the current I ≡ I0, and obtain R = 80π2(∆z/λ)2Ω, if L = ∆z.

This is actually the most interesting case for our study, because it considers

the segment ∆z (which contains the charge q) as an antenna. This segment has

the radiation resistance R = (2/3)(2π)2(∆z/λ)2 (in our units), which directly

results from the third term of (17), and could also be written as:

R = Pself
I 2

,

(30)

11

where the work is Pself = Fself v, Fself being (2/3)q2 ˙a, and I is the charge ﬂow

per unit time - or current. We see that Fself in a continuum of charges could

be considered as the force acted by the perturbed neighbor.

The radiation resistance is therefore the ”self work” divided by the charges

ﬂow rate squared.

We have to remark that this result has been derived with the aid of several

approximations like ρ0 ≫ C1,2/c, resulting in v ≪ c, which are very accurate for

charges in a real wire, but cannot be counted on for a single charge. Therefore,

result (30) is not a proof of the formula Fself = (2/3)q2 ˙a, but rather shows that

in a macro perspective, it looks like the self force of a charge, which accounts

for the radiation, is (2/3)q2 ˙a.

Moreover, Pself comes out to be also (2/3)q2a2 (averaged on a time cy-

cle), which is the Larmor formula, describing the emitted energy per unit

of emission time. This is because: v(t) = I(t)

ρ0 = I0 cos(ωt)

ρ0

≡ v0 cos(ωt),

a(t) = −ωv0 sin(ωt), ˙a(t) = −ω2v0 cos(ωt) and therefore ˙av = −(ωv0)2 cos2(ωt)

and a2 = (ωv0)2 sin2(ωt). Both sin2(ωt) and cos2(ωt) averaged on a cycle, give

The result that | ˙av| = a2 implies that Pself represents the ”self work”, i.e.

Fself v and also the emitted energy per unit of emission time, suggesting that

the self force is an energy conservation force.

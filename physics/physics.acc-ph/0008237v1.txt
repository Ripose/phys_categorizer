Abstract

We show that scattering matrix calculations for dipole
modes between 23-43 GHz for the 206 cell detuned struc-
ture (DS) are consistent with ﬁnite element calculations and
results of the uncoupled model. In particular, the rms sum
wake for these bands is comparable to that of the ﬁrst dipole
band. We also show that for RDDS1 uncoupled wakeﬁeld
calculations for higher bands are consistent with measure-
ments.
In particular, a clear 26 GHz signal in the short
range wake is found in both results.

INTRODUCTION

In the Next Linear Collider (NLC)[1], long trains of intense
bunches are accelerated through the linacs on their way to
the collision point. One serious problem that needs to be
addressed is multi–bunch, beam break–up (BBU) caused
by wakeﬁelds in the linac accelerating structures. To coun-
teract this instability the structures are designed so that the
dipole modes are detuned and weakly damped. Most of the
effort in reducing wakeﬁelds, however, has been focused on
modes in the ﬁrst dipole passband, which overwhelmingly
dominate. However, with a required reduction of about two
orders of magnitude, one wonders whether the higher band
wakes are sufﬁciently small.

For multi-cell accelerating structures higher band dipole
modes can be obtained by several different methods. These
include the so-called “uncoupled” model, which does not
accurately treat the cell-to-cell coupling of the modes[2],
an open–mode, ﬁeld expansion method[3], and a ﬁnite
element method employing many parallel processors[4].
(Note that the circuit approaches[5][6] do not lend them-
selves well to the study of higher bands.) A scattering
matrix (S-matrix) approach can naturally be applied to
cavities composed of a series of waveguide sections[7],
such as a detuned structure (DS), and such a method has
been used before to obtain ﬁrst band modes in detuned
structures[8][9]. Such a method can also be applied to the
study of higher band modes.

the 3rd to the
8th passbands—ranging from 23-43 GHz—of a full 206–
cell NLC DS accelerating structure. We then compare our
results with those of a ﬁnite element calculation and those
of the uncoupled model. Next we repeat the uncoupled
calculation for the latest version of the NLC structure, the

rounded, detuned structure (RDDS1). Finally, we compare
these results with those of the DS structure and with recent
wakeﬁeld measurements performed at ASSET[12].

2 S-MATRIX WAKE CALCULATION

Let us consider an earlier version of the NLC accelerating
structure, the DS structure. It is a cylindrically–symmetric,
disk–loaded structure operating at X-band, at fundamental
frequency f0 = 11.424 GHz. The structure consists of
206 cells, with the frequencies in the ﬁrst dipole passband
detuned according to a Gaussian distribution. Dimensions
of representative cells are given in Table 1, where a is the
iris radius, b the cavity radius, and g the cavity gap. Note
that the structure operates at 2π/3 phase advance, and the
period p = 8.75 mm.

For our S-matrix calculation we follow the approach
of Ref. [11]: A structure with M cells is modeled by a
set of 2M joined waveguide sections of radii am or bm,
each ﬁlled with a number of dipole TE and TM waveg-
uide modes. First the S-matrix for the individual sections
is obtained, and then, by cascading, the S-matrix for the
composite structure is found. Using this matrix, the real
part of the transverse impedance R⊥ at discrete frequency
points is obtained. We simulate a structure closed at both
ends, and one with no wall losses. For such a structure R⊥
consists of a series of inﬁnitesimally narrow spikes. To fa-
cilitate calculation we artiﬁcially widen them by introduc-
ing a small imaginary frequency shift, one small compared
to the minimum spacing of the modes. To facilitate com-
parison with the results of other calculation methods, we
ﬁt R⊥(ω) to a sum of Lorentzian distributions, from which
we extract the mode frequencies fn and kick factors kn.
Knowing these the wakeﬁeld is given by

with s the distance between driving and test particles, c the
speed of light, and Qn the quality factor of mode n.

For our DS S-matrix calculation we approximate the
rounded irises by squared ones. We use 15 TE and 15 TM
waveguide modes for each structure cavity region, and 8
TE and 8 TM modes for each iris region. Our imaginary
frequency shift is 1.5 MHz. Our resulting kick factors,
for frequencies in the 3rd–8th passbands (23–43 GHz), are
shown in Fig. 1. (Note that the effect of the 2nd band modes
is small and can be neglected.) In Fig. 1 we show also, for
comparison, the results of a ﬁnite element calculation of the
entire DS structure[4], an earlier calculation that, however,
does include the rounding of the irises.

Figure 1: Results for the DS structure as obtained by the
S-matrix and the ﬁnite element approaches. Note that the
dimensions in the two cases differ slightly.

We note from Fig. 1 that the agreement in the results
of the two methods is quite good, taking into account the
difference in geometries. We see that the strongest modes
are ones in the 3rd band (24-27 GHz), the 6th band (35-
37 GHz), and the 7th band (38-40 GHz), with peak values
of k = .04, .08, and .08 V/pC/mm/m, respectively (which
should be compared to .4 V/pC/mm/m for 1st band modes).
However, thanks to the variation in a (for the 7th band)
and g (for the 3rd and 6th bands), these bands are seen to
be signiﬁcantly detuned, or spread in frequency. Another
comparison is to take 2 P kn for the bands, a quantity that
is related to the strength of the wakeﬁeld for s ∼ 0, be-
fore coupling or detuning have any effect. For our S-matrix
calculation for bands 3-8 this sum equals 19, for the ﬁnite
element results 21 V/pC/mm/m (for the ﬁrst two bands it is
74 V/pC/mm/m).

It is also necessary to know the mode Q’s to know the
strength of the wakeﬁeld at bunch positions. A pessimistic
estimate takes the natural Q’s due to Ohmic losses in the
walls for the closed structure. Assuming copper walls these
Q’s are very high for some of these higher band modes (>
10000). In the real structure, however, the Q’s can be much
less, depending on the coupling of the modes to the beam
tubes and the fundamental mode couplers, effects that in
principle can be included in the S-matrix calculation. In
practice, however, these calculations are very difﬁcult.

3 THE UNCOUPLED MODEL

The uncoupled model is a relatively simple way of estimat-
ing the impedance and the wake. It can be applied easily
to higher band modes (unlike the circuit models) and to
structures that are not composed of a series of waveguide
sections (unlike the S-matrix approach). However, since
it does not accurately treat the cell-to-cell coupling of the
modes, it does not give the correct long time behavior of
the wakeﬁeld.

The wakeﬁeld, according to the uncoupled model, is
given by an equation like Eq. 1, except that the sum is over
the number of cells M times the number of bands P , and
the mode frequencies and kick factors are replaced by ˜fpm
and ˜kpm, which represent the synchronous mode frequen-
cies and kick factors, for band p, of the periodic structure
with dimensions of cell m of the real structure. For our
uncoupled calculation we obtain the ˜fpm and ˜kpm for a
few representative cells of the structure using an electro-
magnetic ﬁeld solving program, such as MAFIA[13], and
obtain them for the rest by interpolation.

In Fig. 2 we plot again the kick factors obtained by the
S-matrix approach for the DS structure (rectangular irises),
but now compared to the results of the uncoupled model
applied to the same structure. The agreement is better than
in Fig. 1. We expect the kick factors for the two methods
to be somewhat different, due to the cell-to-cell coupling,
but the running sum of kick factors, which is related to the
short-time wake, should be nearly the same. The running
sum, beginning at 20 GHz, of the two calculations is plotted
in Fig. 3. We note that agreement, indeed, is very good.

(square irises).

In Fig. 4 we plot the amplitude of the dipole wakes, for
the frequency range 23-43 GHz only, of the DS structure
(with squared irises), as obtained by the two approaches.
(Here Q has been set to 6500, appropriate for copper wall
losses for the 15 GHz passband). Note that horizontal axis
of the graph is √s in order to emphasize the wake over
the shorter distances. Far right in the plot is equivalent to
s = 80 m, the NLC bunch train length. We note that the
initial drop-off and the long-range wake are very similar,
though there is some difference in the region of 1-10 m.

study the higher band wakes we have removed the 15 GHz
component from the data in the plots. The remaining wake
was ﬁt to the function A sin(2πF + Φ) with A, F , and Φ
ﬁtting parameters. This ﬁt, along with the 3rd band compo-
nent of the uncoupled model results (∼ 26 GHz), are also
given in the ﬁgures. At .7 nsec this component is clearly
seen in the data, and the amplitude and phase are in reason-
able agreement with the calculation. At 1.4 ns there is more
noise, though the 26 GHz component can still be seen.

Figure 3: Running sum of kick factor comparison.

The amplitude at the origin, 20 V/pC/mm/m, is small com-
pared to 78 V/pC/mm/m for the ﬁrst dipole band, but the
longer time typical amplitude of ∼ 1 V/pC/mm/m is com-
parable to that of the ﬁrst band. The rms of the sum wake,
Srms, an indicator of the strength of the wake force at the
bunch positions, for the higher bands is .5 V/pC/mm/m,
which is comparable to that of the ﬁrst dipole band. De-
pending on the external Q for the structure, however, Srms
for the higher bands may in reality be much smaller.

Figure 4: Comparison of wakeﬁelds (23-43 GHz frequency
range only) for the DS structure (square irises).

The latest version of the NLC structure is RDDS1 which
has rounded irises as well as rounded cavities. As such it is
difﬁcult to calculate using the S-matrix approach. We have
not yet done a parallel processor, ﬁnite element calculation,
but we have done an uncoupled one. The sum of the kick
factors of the result is given also in Fig. 3 above. Although
the running sums at 42 GHz for DS and RDDS1 are very
similar, at lower frequencies the curves are quite different.
In particular, the 3rd band modes (∼ 26 GHz) appear to be
less detuned for RDDS1, the 4th and 5th band modes (27-
31 GHz) are stronger, though still detuned, and between
32-40 GHz there is very little impedance.

4 ASSET MEASUREMENTS

Measurements of the wakeﬁelds in RDDS1 were per-
formed at ASSET[12]. In Figs. 5,6 we present results for
the vicinity of .7 and 1.4 nsec behind the driving bunch. To

Abstract

We study a method of laser-Compton cooling of electron beams for future linear colliders. Using

a Monte Carlo code, we evaluate the eﬀects of the laser-electron interaction for transverse cooling.

The optics with and without chromatic correction for the cooling are examined. The laser-Compton

cooling for JLC/NLC at E0 = 2 GeV is considered.

INTRODUCTION

An operation of the e+e− linear collider at a center-of-mass energy of 5 TeV beyond
the Large Hadron Collider and the 500 GeV e+e− linear collider, requires a luminosity of
1035cm−2s−1 for a study of particle physics. To achieve the required luminosity in several

TeV colliders, the phase space of the electron and positron beams must be signiﬁcantly

reduced before the beam is accelerated in a main linear accelerator.

The technique which could accomplish the required cooling for the linear colliders was

proposed by R. Palmer and V.Telnov [1, 2] and is laser-Compton cooling. In laser-Compton

cooling, the beam loses both transverse and longitudinal momentum by Compton scattered

photons, during head-on collisions with laser photons. The longitudinal momentum is re-

stored to the beam in a linear accelerator. Since the Compton scattered photons follow

the initial electron trajectory with a small additional spread due to much lower energy of

photons (a few eV) than the energy of electrons (several GeV), the transverse distribution of

electron beams remains almost unchanged and also the angular spread is almost constant.
Consequently the emittance ǫi = σiσ′

i the
transverse beam size and the angular divergence. At the same time, the electron energy

i remains almost unchanged (i = x, y), where σi, σ′

decreases from E0 to Ef . Thus the normalized emittances have decreased as follows

ǫn = γǫ = ǫn0(Ef /E0) = ǫn0/C,

(1)

where ǫn0, ǫn are the initial and ﬁnal normalized emittances, γ = E/mec2, me is electron

mass, and the factor of the emittance reduction C = E0/Ef . The method of electron beam

cooling, repeated many times, allows further reduction of the transverse emittances after

damping rings or guns by 1-3 orders of magnitude [2].

In this paper, we have evaluated the eﬀects of the laser-Compton interaction for trans-

verse cooling using the Monte Carlo code [3, 4]. The simulation calculates the eﬀects of

the nonlinear Compton scattering between the laser photons and the electrons during a

multi-cooling stage. Next, we examine the optics for cooling with and without chromatic

correction. The laser-Compton cooling for JLC/NLC [5] at E0 = 2 GeV is considered in

section 4. A summary of conclusion is given in section 5.

In this section we describe the main parameters for laser-Compton cooling of electron

beams. A laser photon of energy ωL (wavelength λL) is backward-Compton scattered by

an electron beam of energy E0 in the interaction point (IP). The kinematics of Compton

scattering is characterized by the dimensionless parameter [2]

Table I and II. The parameters of the electron beam with 2 GeV are given for JLC/NLC

case in section 4. The parameters of that with 5 GeV are used for simulation in the next

subsection. The wavelength of laser is assumed to be 0.5 µm. The parameters of x0 with

the electron energies 2 GeV and 5 GeV are 0.076 and 0.19, respectively.

where ZR, lγ(∼ 2σL,z), and le(∼ 2σz) are the Rayleigh length of laser, and the bunch lengths

of laser and electron beams. From this formula, the parameters of A with the electron

energies 2 GeV and 5 GeV are 56 J and 4 J, respectively.

where the rms energy of the initial beam is σe0 and the ratio of energy spread is deﬁned as

δ = σe/Ef . If the parameter ξ or x0 is larger, the energy spread after Compton scattering is

increasing and it is the origin of the emittance growth in the defocusing optics, reacceleration

linac, and focusing optics. The energy spreads δ for the electron energies 2 GeV and 5 GeV

are 9.8% and 19%, respectively.

where βi are the beta functions at IP. From this formula we can see that small beta gives

small emittance. However the large change of the beta functions between the magnet and

the IP causes the emittance growth. Taking no account of the emittance growth, for the
electron energies 2 GeV and 5 GeV, the equilibrium emittances are 5.8 × 10−9 m·rad and
1.4×10−10 m·rad, respectively. The equilibrium emittances depended on ξ in the case ξ2 ≫ 1

were calculated in Ref. [2].

B. Simulation of Laser-Electron Interaction

For the simulation of laser-electron interaction, the electron beam is simply assumed to

be a round beam in the case of E0 = 5 GeV and C = 5. Taking no account of the emittance

growth of optics, the one stage for cooling consists two parts as follows:

1. The laser-Compton interaction between the electron and laser beams.

2. The reacceleration of electrons in the linac.

In the ﬁrst part, we simulated the interactions by the CAIN code [4]. This simulation

calculates the eﬀects of the nonlinear Compton scattering between the laser photons and

the electrons. We assumed that the laser pulse interacts with the electron bunch in head-on

collisions. The βx and βy at the IP are ﬁxed to be 0.1 mm. The initial energy spread of the

electron beams is 1%. The energy of laser pulse is 20 J. The polarization of the electron

and laser beams are Pe=1.0 and PL=1.0 (circular polarization), respectively. When the x0

parameter is small, the spectrum of the scattered photons does not largely depend on the

polarization combination. In order to accelerate the electron beams to 5 GeV for recovery of

energy in the second part, we simply added the energy ∆E = 5 GeV−Eave for reacceleration,

where Eave is the average energy of the scattered electron beams after the laser-Compton

interaction.

Figure 1 shows the longitudinal distribution of the electrons after the ﬁrst laser-Compton

scattering. The average energy of the electron beams is 1.0 GeV and the energy spread δ is

0.19. The longitudinal distribution seems to be a boomerang. If we assume a short Rayleigh

length of laser pulse, the energy loss of head and tail of beams is small. The number of the

scattered photons per incoming particle and the photon energy at the ﬁrst stage are 40 and

96 MeV (rms energy 140 MeV), respectively.

The transverse sizes of the electron beams in the multi-stage cooling are shown in Fig. 2.

During collisions with the laser photons, the transverse distribution of the electrons remains

the longitudinal emittance rapidly increases at the ﬁrst stage. After the ﬁrst stage, the

for cooling. The 8th or 9th cooling stages have small reduction for cooling. The initial and

There are three optical devices for the laser-Compton cooling of electron beams as follows:

1. The focus optics to the ﬁrst IP.

2. The defocus optics from the ﬁrst IP to the reacceleration linac.

3. The focus optics from the linac to the next IP.

Figure 8 shows a schematic diagram of the laser-Compton cooling of the electron beams. The

optics 1 is focusing the electron beams from a few meters of β-function to several millimeters

in order to eﬀectively interact them with the laser beams. The optics 2 is defocusing them

from several millimeters to a few meters for reacceleration of electron beams in a linac. In

a multi-stage cooling system, the optics 3 is needed for cooling in the next stage. The key

problem for the focus and defocus optical devices is the energy spread of electrons and the

electron beams with a large energy spread are necessary to minimize or correct the chromatic

aberrations avoiding emittance growth.

In this subsection we discuss the optics for laser-Compton cooling without chromatic

corrections. For the focus and defocus of the beams, we use the ﬁnal doublet system which

is similar to that of the ﬁnal focus system of the future linear colliders [5]. The pole-tip ﬁeld

of the ﬁnal quadrupole BT is limited to 1.2 T and the pole-tip radius a is greater than 3

mm. The strength of the ﬁnal quadrupole is

κ = BT /(aBρ) ≤ 120/E[GeV] [m−2],

(7)

where B, ρ, and E are the magnetic ﬁeld, the radius of curvature, and the energy of the

electron beams. In our case, the electron energies in the optics 1, 2, and 3 are 5.0, 1.0, and

5.0 GeV, respectively and the limit of the strength of the quadrupole in laser cooling is much

larger than that of the ﬁnal quadrupole of the future linear colliders. Due to the low energy

beams in laser cooling, the synchrotron radiation from quadrupoles and bends is negligible.

The diﬀerence of three optical devices is the amount of the energy spread of the beams.

In the optics 1,2, and 3, the beams have one, several tens, and a few % energy spread. In

order to minimize the chromatic aberrations, we need to shorten the length between the

ﬁnal quadrupole and the IP. In this study, the length from the face of the ﬁnal quadrupole

to the IP, l is assumed to be 2 cm. Here we estimated the emittance growth in the optics 2,

because the chromatic eﬀect in the optics 2 is the most serious. Figure 9 shows the defocus

optics for laser-Compton cooling by the MAD code [6]. The input ﬁle is attached to Ref. [7].

4 mm, respectively. The ﬁnal βx and βy are assumed to be 2 m and 1 m, respectively. The

initial and ﬁnal αx(y) with no energy spread δ = 0 are 0 in this optics. The strength κ of the
ﬁnal quadrupole for the beam energy of 1 GeV from Eq. (7) is assumed to be 120 m−2.

In our case, the chromatic functions ξx and ξy are 18 and 148, respectively. The mo-

mentum dependence of the emittances in the defocus optics without chromaticity correction

is shown in Fig. 10. In the paper [8], the analytical study by thin-lens approximation has

been studied for the focusing system, and here the transverse emittances are calculated by

a particle-tracking simulation. The 10000 particles are tracked for the transverse and lon-

gitudinal Gaussian distribution by the MAD code. The relative energy spread δ is changed

from 0 to 0.4. Due to the larger chromaticity ξy, the emittance ǫy is rapidly increasing with

the energy spread δ. If we set a limit of 200% for ∆ǫi/ǫi (i = x, y), the permissible energy

spread δx and δy are 0.11 and 0.012 which mean the momentum band width ±22% and

±2.4%, respectively. The results are not suﬃcient for cooling at E0 = 5 GeV and C = 5,

because the beams through the defocusing optics have the energy spread of several tens %.

On the one hand, the optics can be useful as the optics 1 and 3 with the energy spread of a

few %.

B. Optics with chromaticity correction

The optics without chromaticity correction for the optics 2 does not work as we seen

before subsection. In this subsection we apply the chromaticity correction for the optics 2.

The lattice for cooling is designed referring to the ﬁnal focus system of the future linear

colliders by K. Oide [9]. The ﬁnal doublet system is the same lattice as the optics before

subsection. The method of chromaticity correction uses one family of sextupole to correct

for vertical chromaticity and moreover we added two weak sextupoles in the lattice to correct

for horizontal chromaticity. Figure 11 shows the defocus optics with chromaticity correction

for laser-Compton cooling. The input ﬁle is attached to Ref. [7]. The total length of the

lattice is about 63 m.

The momentum dependence of the emittances in the defocus optics with chromaticity

correction is shown in Fig. 12. The 10000 particles are tracked for the transverse and

longitudinal Gaussian distribution by the MAD code. The relative energy spread δ is changed

from 0 to 0.06 with the conservation κ2 θB, where κ2 and θB are the strength of the sextupole

are 20 mm and 4 mm, respectively. The ﬁnal βx and βy are assumed to be 2 m and 1 m,

respectively. The initial and ﬁnal αx(y) with no energy spread δ = 0 are 0 in this optics.

After the chromaticity correction, the chromaticity functions ξx and ξy are 9.3 and 1.6,

respectively. If we set a limit of 200% for ∆ǫi/ǫi(i = x, y), the permissible energy spread

δx and δy are 0.040 and 0.023 which mean the momentum band width ±8% and ±4.6%,

respectively. By the comparison with the results of the optics with chromaticity correction

at a limit of 200% for ∆ǫi/ǫi(i = x, y), the ǫy of the optics without chromaticity correction

is about two times larger than that of the one with chromaticity correction, but the ǫx of

the optics with chromaticity correction is three times smaller than that of the one before.

The results are still not suﬃcient for cooling with E0 = 5 GeV and C = 5. These results

emphasize the need to pursue further ideas for plasma lens [10].

IV. LASER-COMPTON COOLING FOR JLC/NLC AT E0 = 2 GEV

A. Optics without chromaticity correction

For the future linear colliders, the method of laser-Compton cooling is eﬀective to reduce

the transverse emittances after damping rings. Where can it be placed? There are two

possibilities for JLC/NLC [11] as follows:

1. After the ﬁrst bunch compressor (BC1) and before the pre-linac. E0 = 2 GeV and

σz = 0.5 mm.

14

2. After the second compressor (BC2) and before the main linac. E0 = 10 GeV and

σz = 0.1 mm.

The case 2 needs a large energy for recovery after Compton scattering and we consider the

case 1 in this study. The parameters of the electron and laser beams for laser-Compton

cooling for JLC/NLC at E0 = 2 GeV and C = 10 are listed in Table I and II. The energy of

laser pulse is 300 J. The simulation results of the laser-electron interaction by the CAIN code

are summarized as follows. The energy spread of the electron beam is 11%. The decrease

of the longitudinal polarization of the electron beam is 0.038 (Pe = 1.0, PL = 1.0). The

number of the scattered photons per incoming particle and the photon energy are 200 and

8.9 MeV (rms energy 19 MeV), respectively.

optics for laser-Compton cooling for JLC/NLC at E0 = 2 GeV and C = 10. The ﬁnal βx

and βy are assumed to be 1 m and 0.25 m, respectively. The chromaticity functions ξx and

ξy are 18 and 23, respectively. Using the MAD code, the emittance growth in the defocus

In the reacceleration linac, there are two major sources of the emittance increase [11] as

optics is

The ﬁnal emittance growth and the ﬁnal emittance with C = 10 are

The total reduction factor of the 6D emittance of the laser-Compton cooling for JLC/NLC

at E0 = 2 GeV is about 13. The decrease of the polarization of the electron beam is 0.038

due to the laser-Compton interaction.

V. SUMMARY

We have studied the method of laser-Compton cooling of electron beams for future linear

colliders. The eﬀects of the laser-Compton interaction for cooling have been evaluated by

the Monte Carlo simulation. From the simulation in the multi-stage cooling, we presented
that the low emittance beams with ǫ6N = 1.2 × 10−19(m·rad)3 can be achieved in our beam

parameters. We also examined the optics with and without chromatic correction for cooling,

but the optics are not suﬃcient for cooling due to the large energy spread of the electron

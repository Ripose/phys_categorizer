Strength of Higher-Order Spin-Orbit Resonances

When polarized particles are accelerated in a synchrotron, the spin precession can be periodically
driven by Fourier components of the electromagnetic ﬁelds through which the particles travel. This
leads to resonant perturbations when the spin-precession frequency is close to a linear combination
of the orbital frequencies. When such resonance conditions are crossed, partial depolarization or
spin ﬂip can occur. The amount of polarization that survives after resonance crossing is a function of
the resonance strength and the crossing speed. This function is commonly called the Froissart-Stora
formula. It is very useful for predicting the amount of polarization after an acceleration cycle of a
synchrotron or for computing the required speed of the acceleration cycle to maintain a required
amount of polarization. However, the resonance strength could in general only be computed for
ﬁrst-order resonances and for synchrotron sidebands. When Siberian Snakes adjust the spin tune
to be 1
2 , as is required for high energy accelerators, ﬁrst-order resonances do not appear and higher-
order resonances become dominant. Here we will introduce the strength of a higher-order spin-orbit
resonance, and also present an eﬃcient method of computing it. Several tracking examples will
show that the so computed resonance strength can indeed be used in the Froissart-Stora formula.
HERA-p is used for these examples which demonstrate that our results are very relevant for existing
accelerators.

INTRODUCTION

azimuth and

In this paper we want to introduce the strength of
higher-order spin orbit resonances which we want to use
in the Froissart-Stora formula to compute how much po-
larization is lost when a resonance is crossed. For ﬁrst-
order resonances the deﬁnition and computation of the
resonance strength is relatively simple [1, 2], for higher-
order resonances it is much more elaborate. We will need
to use the invariant spin ﬁeld, also called the ~n-axis [3],
the amplitude dependent spin tune and the periodic coor-
dinate system over phase space that determines the spin
tune [4]. These concepts are therefore quickly reviewed
in this introduction.

While a polarized particle moves along the azimuth
θ = 2πl
L of the storage ring’s closed orbit with path length
l and total length L, its semi-classical spin precesses ac-
cording to the T-BMT equation [5, 6]

~m = (~Ω0 − ν0~n0) × ~m ,

~l = (~Ω0 − ν0~n0) × ~l .

(3)

Since particles on the closed orbit have spins that pre-
cess around ~n0, the product s3 = ~S(θ) ·~n0(θ) is an invari-
ant, i.e. does not depend on θ. It can be shown that it is
also an adiabatic invariant [7, 8, 9], i.e. it hardly changes
when parameters of the system, like the storage energy,
are slowly changed.

This concept of an invariant spin direction, a spin tune,
a periodic system of unit vectors and an adiabatic invari-
ant can be extended to particles that do not move on
the closed orbit but oscillate around this orbit and whose
motion is thus described by phase space trajectories ~z(θ).
The T-BMT equation for spin motion then depends on
the phase space trajectory

d
dθ

~S = ~Ω(~z, θ) × ~S .

(4)

The spin direction that is periodic after one turn is re-
ferred to as ~n0(θ). If the spin has any other direction,
it precesses around ~n0. The numbers of precessions that
occur during one turn is referred to as the closed orbit
spin tune ν0. To describe the precession, a right handed
system of orthogonal unit vectors ( ~m,~l, ~n0) is introduced
for any azimuth. The two vectors ~l(θ) and ~m(θ) precess
around ~n0 according to the T-BMT equation so that they
would have rotated ν0 times after one turn. However
a precession is added that continuously winds back ν0
precessions. These vectors are therefore periodic in the

If the vector ﬁeld ~f (~z, θ) with | ~f | = 1 describes the
spin distribution in a particle beam, it is called a spin
ﬁeld and satisﬁes the T-BMT equation

d
dθ

~f (~z(θ), θ) = ~Ω(~z, θ) × ~f .

(5)

A special spin ﬁeld that is periodic from turn to turn is
called the invariant spin ﬁeld ~n,

~n(~z, θ + 2π) = ~n(~z, θ) .

(6)

Particles that travel along the trajectory ~z(θ) have
spins that precess around ~n(~z(θ), θ). Describing this pre-
cession and even the number of precessions in one turn
starting at ~z(θ0) is not trivial, since the particle has a
new phase space point ~z(θ0 + 2π) after one turn. An
orthogonal set of unit vectors (~u1, ~u2, ~n) has to be de-
ﬁned for each phase space point and for each azimuth to
determine spin precession angles.

If the unit vectors ~u1 and ~u2 would satisfy the T-BMT
equation along each phase space trajectory starting at
~zi and ending at ~zf after one turn, these vectors would
precess around ~n and after one turn ~ui(~zf , θ0 + 2π) would
have some angle 2π˜ν(~z0) with respect to the initial unit
vectors ~ui(~zf , θ0) at the same phase space point.

The rotation angle 2π˜ν is not well deﬁned, since the
direction of the ~ui before and after the turn is only re-
quired to be perpendicular to ~n, but has a free angular
orientation in the orthogonal plain. This free orientation
for each phase space point can (under certain general
conditions [7, 10, 11]) be chosen to make the number of
rotations ν independent of the orbital phase variables ~Φ.
It then only depends on the amplitudes ~J of the orbital
motion and is therefore called the amplitude dependent
spin tune ν( ~J).

To obtain a periodic set of unit vectors, the described
precession of the unit vectors is again augmented by con-
tinuously winding back ν spin precessions during one
turn,

d
dθ

~ui(~z(θ), θ) = [~Ω(~z, θ) − ν( ~J)~n(~z, θ)] × ~ui .

Since

product
JS = ~S(θ) · ~n(~z(θ), θ) is an invariant of motion,
i.e. it
does not change with θ. It can be shown, however, that
it is also an adiabatic invariant [7, 8, 12], i.e. it hardly
changes when system parameters like the storage energy
change suﬃciently slowly. This has strong implications.
When a beam is polarized parallel to the invariant spin
ﬁeld ~n(~z, Ei) at some initial energy Ei and the storage
energy is increased slowly, the beam will be polarized
parallel to ~n(~z, Ef ) at the ﬁnal energy Ef .

This is a very important property since a beam in such
a polarization state will have the average polarization
Plim =< ~n > after acceleration, which can be large even
if this average polarization is small at intermediate ener-
gies.

II. THE SINGLE RESONANCE MODEL (SRM)

A. Fourier Expansion of Spin Perturbations

The quantities ~n, ν, ~u1, ~u2 and JS will be computed
for an analytically solvable model and the adiabatic in-
variance will be illustrated by letting a parameter of this
model change. Since this model leads to the Froissart-
Stora formula, a comparison of its equations with the

2

equations of general spin dynamics leads to the intro-
duction of higher-order resonance strengths that can be
used in the Froissart-Stora formula.

The spin precession vector for particles which oscil-
late around the closed orbit can be decomposed into the
closed-orbit contribution ~Ω0 and a part ~ω due to the
particles’ oscillations, ~Ω(~z, θ) = ~Ω0(θ) + ~ω(~z, θ). In the
( ~m,~l, ~n0) system we write

~S = s1 ~m + s2~l + s3~n0 , ~ω = ω1 ~m + ω2~l + ω3~n0 .

(8)

With the complex notation ˆs = s1 +is2 and ω = ω1 +iω2,
the equation of spin motion is

~Ω × ~S = ~m

s1 +~l

s2 + ~n0

s3 + (~Ω0 − ν0~n0) × ~S (9)

d

and the equation of motion for ˆs is obtained by mul-

Spin precession on the closed orbit (ω = 0) leads to a
constant ˆs0 due to the left equation. The right equa-
tion describes additional precessions due to phase space
motion.

If the motion in phase space can be transformed
to action-angle variables, the spin precession vector
~ω( ~J , ~Φ, θ) for particles which oscillate around the closed
orbit is a 2π-periodic function of ~Φ and θ. The Fourier
spectrum of ω( ~J, Φ0 + ~Qθ, θ) has frequencies κ = j0 +~j · ~Q
where the jk are integers and ~Q describes the tunes of
synchrotron and betatron oscillations. The integer con-
tributions j0 are due to the 2π periodicity of ~ω in θ and
give rise to so-called imperfection resonances. The con-
tributions ~j · ~Q of integer multiples of the orbit tunes are
due to the 2π periodicity of ~ω in the orbital phases Φk
and give rise to so-called intrinsic resonances [1]. When
one of the Fourier frequencies is nearly in resonance with
ν0, one component of e−iν0θω is nearly constant. Then
it can be a good approximation to drop all other Fourier
components since their inﬂuence on spin motion can av-
erage to zero so that they are in eﬀect less dominant.
This is referred to as the single resonance approxima-
tion. Note that this approximation can only be good
when the domains of inﬂuence of individual resonances
are well separated. This model corresponds to the ro-
tating ﬁeld approximation often used to discuss spin res-
onance in solid state physics [13]. Note also that for a
conventional ﬂat ring, the ﬁrst-order resonances due to
vertical motion dominate and therefore the Fourier com-
ponents with frequencies κ = j0 ± Qy are often of most
interest.

The amplitude of a single Fourier contribution is some-
times called the resonance strength. This is misleading
since generally it cannot be used in the Froissart-Stora
formula. The fact that the Fourier component is not
the resonance strength manifest itself clearly in models
where where ~ω is linear and has only ﬁrst-order Fourier
3
k=1 |jk| = 1. Such a ~ω can
components, i.e. those with
lead to depolarization or spin ﬂip at ﬁrst-order resonances
P
but also at higher-order resonances [18, 19, 20, 21]. The
strength of these resonances that might be use in the
Froissart-Stora formula can clearly not be determined
by the higher order Fourier coeﬃcients, i.e. those where
3
k=1 |jk| > 1, since those are zero. In fact all examples
of higher-order resonances that will be shown in this pa-
P
per were computed for such a linear model of HERA-p
with Siberian Snakes [30].

A higher order resonance can thus be created either by
a higher-order Fourier component or by feed-up of lower
order components. Such a feed-up can occur due to the
inherent non-commutativity of three dimensional rota-
tions or equivalently due to the nonlinearity of the map-
ping from the unit sphere to the complex plane which
gives rise to the square root term in the equation of mo-
tion (10). Obtaining a resonance strength ǫκ that can be
used to describe depolarization therefore has to include
all these feed-up eﬀects. Before the following investi-
gations it was not clear whether a Froissart-Stora for-
mula with some resonance strength ǫκ could be applied
to crossing such higher-order resonances. But even if it
can be applied, it is clear that the resonance strength
cannot be obtained from a Fourier coeﬃcient of ~ω in
(10). Moreover, in high energy accelerators, the n-th
order Fourier coeﬃcients of ~ω are not even the dominant
contribution to the strength of a n-th order resonance.
Usually the former contain Gγ, whereas the feed-up con-
tributions from combining m lower order harmonics, con-
tain (Gγ)m, which can be an exceedingly large number.
3
k=1 |jk| = 1,
there is no feed-up contribution and the Fourier compo-
nents can generally be used in the Froissart-Stora formula
and there are diﬀerent straight forward ways of comput-
ing ǫκ in that case [1, 2].

B. Solutions for the SRM

The analytically solvable model advertised above is
usually called the single resonance model (SRM). It has
~Ω0 = ν0~n0 and an ~ω which only has one Fourier contribu-
tion, ~ω = ǫκ( ~m cos Φ +~l sin Φ), with Φ = j0θ +~j · ~Φ + Φ0.
Note that the modulus of its higher-order Fourier coeﬃ-
cient is denoted as ǫκ since there are no lower order coeﬃ-
cients that could contribute to the resonance strength by
a feed-up precess. Any dependence on the orbital actions
can be expressed by ǫκ( ~J).

This ~ω is perpendicular to ~n0 and tilts spins away from
~Φ = ~Q, the frequency is κ = j0 + ~j · ~Q and

~n0. Since d

Initial coordinates ~zi are taken into ﬁnal coordinates ~zf

whence Φf = Φi + 2πκ. Now the orthogonal matrix
T (~e, ϕ) is introduced to describe a rotation around a unit
vector ~e by an angle ϕ. Transforming the spin com-
ponents of ~S into a rotating frame using the relation

As required, ~n is

sig(δ) κǫκ
function of phase space, a 2π-periodic function of the
angle variables ~Φ and of θ.

This analytically solvable model can also be used to
illustrate the construction of a phase independent but
amplitude-dependent spin tune ν( ~J ). Once an ~n-axis
has been obtained, one can transform the components
of ~S into a coordinate system [~˜u1, ~˜u2, ~n]. With the sim-

In general, the so found rotation could depend on Φ
and an additional rotation of ~˜u1 and ~˜u2 around ~n can now
be used to make ˜ν independent of the angle variables ~Φ
and to deﬁne the amplitude-dependent spin tune. Here
however, ˜ν is already independent of ~Φ and it is therefore
an amplitude dependent spin tune, and ǫκ = |~ω(~z)| char-
acterizes the orbital amplitude. The freedom of rotating
~u1 and ~u2 around ~n for each phase space point can be
used to obtain a ν which reduces to ν0 on the closed orbit
(ǫκ = 0). We let ~˜u1 and ~˜u2 rotate around ~n by −Φ, to
give the amplitude-dependent spin tune

ν = sig(δ)Λ + κ .

(19)

The corresponding uniformly rotating basis vectors ~u1
and ~u2 become

~u1 = ~˜u1 cos Φ−~˜u2 sin Φ , ~u2 = ~˜u2 cos Φ+~˜u1 sin Φ . (20)

On the closed orbit, the coordinate system now reduces
to

~n → ~n0 , ~u1 → sig(δ) ~m , ~u2 → sig(δ)~l , ν → ν0 . (21)

It drops to 0 at ν0 = κ since according to
versus ν0.
(15) the cone of vectors {~n(Φ)|Φ ∈ [0, 2π]} opens up for
small values of |δ|. This strong reduction of Plim occurs
when ν approaches κ, i.e. close to spin-orbit resonances.
According to (19) ν is never exactly equal to κ, but it
jumps by 2ǫκ across the resonance condition ν = κ, which
is shown in Fig. 1 (bottom). This jump of the spin tune
could in principle be transformed away since the sign of
the spin tune depends on the sign of the rotation direction
~n. Here the sign of ~n in (15) has been ﬁxed by choosing
~n0 · ~n > 0, and the tune jump is therefore essential.

τ of the system is being slowly changed, i.e. d
dθ τ = α. In
particular this allows the study of an acceleration where
ν0 crosses the frequency κ. It is useful to describe the
spin motion in the coordinate system [~u1, ~u2, ~n]. In order
to take account of the change of the basis vectors with
the parameter τ , we use that for a vector with |~ui| = 1,
∂τ ~ui is perpendicular to ~ui so that it can be written as a
rotation,

Since ν0 = Gγ in a ﬂat ring, the acceleration process
in the SRM is usually described by a slowly changing
ν0 = κ + τ with τ = αθ while assuming that κ and ǫκ
do not change with energy. This leads to the following

use the similarity of the SRM in Eq. (32) and the equation
for a general system in Eq. (31) to show how higher-order
resonance strength can be introduced and how they can
be computed.

III. THE FROISSART-STORA FORMULA

For the analytically solvable SRM the change of the
adiabatic invariant JS = ~S · ~n can be computed explic-
itly. When the design-orbit spin tune changes during
the acceleration process, resonances will be encountered,
where ν jumps from κ±ǫκ to κ∓ǫκ while the spin is under
the strong inﬂuence of an approximately resonant Fourier
contribution of ω. It is then found that for some speeds
of the spin tune change, parametrized by α, a reduction
of polarization can occur is due to a generally irreversible
reduction of JS rather than a temporary decrease of Plim,
and which does not recover after the energy has increased
and the resonance is crossed.

To describe the reduction of polarization during reso-
nance crossing, (32) can be used but the usual approach
is to insert a changing closed orbit spin tune ν0 into the
equation of motion (13). The method of solution de-
pends on the form of the function ν0(θ) [1, 16, 17, 21]. If
the closed-orbit spin tune changes like ν0 = κ + αθ, the
equation of spin motion can be solved in terms of con-
ﬂuent hypergeometric functions. The equations for arbi-
trary initial conditions are quite complicated but when
at θ → −∞ a vertical spin s3(−∞) = 1 is chosen as the
initial condition then the vertical component at θ → +∞
is given by the well known and regularly used Froissart-
Stora formula [16],

s3(∞) = 2e−π

2
ǫ
κ
2α − 1 .

(33)

In the case of a strong perturbation ǫκ, or when the
acceleration is very slow, spins follow the change of
~n(Φ). The ~n-axis in (15) has a discontinuity from ~n− =
−ǫκ(cos Φ, sin Φ, 0)T just below resonance to ~n+ = −~n−
just above resonance. Spins do not follow this instanta-
neous change of sign, but they then follow −~n adiabat-
ically after the resonance has been crossed. Therefore

5

s3(∞) is close to −1 for a slow change of ν0. When the
perturbation is weak or crossed very quickly, then spin
motion is hardly aﬀected and s3(∞) is close to 1 in (33).
In intermediate cases, |s3| is reduced. In the ﬁrst case
the polarization is preserved but the spins are reversed.
In the second case the polarization is preserved without
reversal. In the third case the polarization is no longer
vertical but precesses around the vertical so that the time
averaged polarization is reduced.

IV. THE FROISSART-STORA FORMULA FOR
HIGHER-ORDER RESONANCES

As mentioned above, the Froissart-Stora formula in
Eq.(33) is regularly used to describe the reduction of
polarization due to vertical betatron motion during reso-
nance crossing in accelerators where the closed-orbit spin
tune ν0 changes with energy. These descriptions were
normally restricted to ﬂat rings and ν0 = Gγ.

Since Siberian Snakes [22, 23, 24, 25, 26] are unavoid-
able for high-energy polarized beam acceleration, the
design-orbit spin tune is 1
2 in most cases which will be
considered here and it does not change during accelera-
tion. Since the orbital tunes are never chosen to be 1
2 ,
ﬁrst-order resonances with ν = j0 ± Qk are avoided and
higher-order resonances can become dominant. But since
the strength of such resonances cannot be obtained as a
Fourier coeﬃcient of ω(~z(θ), θ), a method for obtaining
the strength of the higher-order resonances is required in
order to use the Froissart-Stora formula when Siberian
Snakes are in use.

HERA-p will require at least 4 Siberian Snakes [7, 27,
28, 29]. The snake angles ϕj of these 4 snakes can be
chosen quite arbitrarily, except for the restriction ∆ϕ =
ϕ4 −ϕ3 +ϕ2 −ϕ1 = π
2 . To illustrate crossing higher-order
resonances a snake scheme for HERA-p was chosen that
has 4 Siberian Snakes with snake angles of π
4 and
0 in the South, East, North and West straight section,
respectively.

4 , 0, π

In Fig. 2 the amplitude-dependent spin tune (green)
and Plim (blue) are plotted versus the reference momen-
tum for a vertical amplitude of 70π mm mrad. Many
higher-order resonances can be observed. The curves for
Plim and ν( ~J ) were computed with the non-perturbative
algorithm SODOM II [31] using the spin-orbit dynam-
ics program SPRINT [15, 32]. The ~n-axis and also Plim
are in general diﬀerent at diﬀerent azimuth θ0. For this
ﬁgure and for all following plots of Plim, the ~n-axis was
observed at the interaction point of the ZEUS experiment
in the South of HERA.

While the design-orbit spin tune remains at 1

2 , the
amplitude-dependent spin tune ν(Jy) changes with en-
ergy and is in resonance with 2Qy at the second line (red)
and with 5Qy − 1 at the bottom line at several energies.
In both cases a clear change of Plim can be observed. The
reduction of Plim at some resonances is similar to the be-
havior for the single resonance approximation shown in

(23) where Plim is reduced at those resonances. The drop
of Plim at 811.2 GeV/c is due to the 2 − 5Qy resonance,
which lies a little below the 2Qy line. At all other en-
ergies where this resonance is crossed, no inﬂuence on
Plim can be observed since the corresponding ﬁfth-order
resonance strength is very small. At some second-order
resonances, Plim increases resonantly. Presumably, two
resonant eﬀects are in constructive interference at these
energies. Nonetheless, polarization can be reduced when
these resonance positions are crossed during acceleration
since a sudden increase of Plim =h~ni is due to a sudden
change of ~n(~z) which might be too sudden for the adia-
batic invariance of JS = ~S · ~n(~z) to be maintained. In
addition one can see in Fig. 2 that the spin tune ν(Jy)
has discontinuities at some of the resonances.

When spin motion in a ring is approximated by a sin-
gle resonance with κ = j0 ± Qy and then Siberian Snakes
are included in the ring, it has often been noted that
only odd-order resonances with κ = j0 + jyQy appear,
i.e. jy is odd. However it can be shown by nonlinear nor-
mal form theory that this is a feature of any ring with
midplane symmetric spin-orbit motion and is not pecu-
liar to rings with Siberian Snakes [10]. For rings without
midplane symmetry, resonances of even order can appear
also. HERA-p has non-ﬂat regions, and rings with closed-
orbit distortions in general do not have midplane sym-
metric motion. Then, resonances with even jy can also
appear and be destructive. In fact, the resonances with
jy = 2 are among the most destructive spin-orbit res-
onances in HERA-p after Siberian Snakes are included.
For the IUCF cooler ring with a partial snake running,
second-order resonances have been observed experimen-
tally [33].

FIG. 2: Plim (blue) and ν(Jy) (green) for particles with a
4.2σ vertical amplitude of 70π mm mrad in HERA-p with
and Qy = 0.289 . Three resonance lines cross ν and at each
crossing Plim exhibits a large variation and there are jumps
in ν, bottom: ν = 5Qy − 1, middle: ν = 2 − 5Qy, and top
ν = 2Qy

When a parameter τ is being varied, the spin motion is
described in the coordinate system [~u1, ~u2, ~n] by Eq. (31).
In the following we will demonstrate that this equation
has some characteristics of the equation of spin motion
(32) of the SRM. If the spin tune ν has a discontinuity

6

from ν− to ν+ at some energy, then we deﬁne the center
frequency κ∗ = 1
2 (ν− + ν+). To take the jump of ν into
account, we introduce Λ∗ = |ν − κ∗|, which does not
have a discontinuity and we express the spin tune as ν =
sig(ν − κ∗)Λ∗ + κ∗.

Since ~η is related to the basis vectors by (25), it is a
2π-periodic function of ~Φ and θ. The jump of ν across κ∗
can be produced by a Fourier component of η if there is a
set of integers so that ~j · ~Q + j0 = κ∗. This is the case in
all instances of spin tune jumps presented here. Accord-
ingly, one can analyze what happens when the Fourier
component ηκ∗ ei(κ∗θ+Φ0) of η dominates the motion of
ˆs. For that analysis, all other Fourier components of η
are ignored. When α is small, spins which are initially
almost parallel to the ~n-axis remain close to ~n so that ˆs
is small and αη3ˆs can therefore be ignored. This leads to

(34)
Due to its similarity with (32), this equation will produce
the observed spin tune jump by 2ǫκ∗ = |ν+ − ν−| if ηκ∗ =
ǫκ∗
Λ∗2 = ǫκ∗
(ν−κ∗)2 in the vicinity of the energy where the
jump occurs. Otherwise (34) would not reproduce this
jump. One is then left with a relation which has exactly
the structure of the equation of motion (32) for the SRM.
Therefore, the Froissart-Stora formula can be applied to
estimate how much polarization is lost when a polarized
beam is accelerated through the energy region where the
spin tune jumps by 2ǫκ. In the following we will check
whether, for some higher-order resonances in HERA-p,
all assumptions leading to the approximation (34) are
satisﬁed to the extent that the Froissart-Stora formula
describes the reduction of polarization well.

The basis vectors ~n, ~u1, and ~u2, and the amplitude-
dependent spin tune ν can in general only be computed
by computationally intensive methods. The perturbing
function η is then obtained from

η = ~η · (~u1 + i~u2) = ~η · (−~n × ~u2 + i~n × ~u1)

= (~η × ~n) · (−~u2 + i~u1) = i(~u1 + i~u2) · (∂τ ~n) ,(35)

but the required diﬀerentiation is prone to numerical in-
accuracies. However, when ~n is computed by perturba-
tive normal form theory using diﬀerential algebra (DA)
[34], the diﬀerentiation with respect to τ can be per-
formed automatically. After η is computed, the Fourier
integral over the complete ring would ﬁnally be required
in order to compute ǫκ.

If (31) can be approximated well by a SRM, there is
however a diﬀerent and much less cumbersome method
for determining the relevant resonance strength and
the resonant frequency. Observation of the amplitude-
dependent spin tune ν( ~J ) allows the determination of all
parameters which are required to evaluate the Froissart-
Stora formula for higher-order resonances: The spin tune
jumps by 2ǫκ, the center of the jump is located at the fre-
quency κ itself, and the rate of change of ν with changing

lim

h~ni

According to (23),
1 − ( ǫκ

energy is used to determine the parameter α for (33). In
the SRM this parameter is ν0−κ
θ where ν0 is the frequency
of spin rotations when the resonance strength vanishes.
Here the corresponding frequency, which would be ob-
served if no perturbation η were present, is not directly
computed. But it can be approximately inferred from
the slope ∂τ ν at some distance from the resonance.
is given by P SRM

=
ν−κ )2 in the SRM. To check whether the observed
q
drop of Plim indeed shows the characteristics of the SRM,
the width of the resonance dip in P SRM
lim was obtained
from the amplitude-dependent spin tune alone and then
compared to the width of the dip in the actual Plim of
the system. This analysis was done for HERA-p’s reso-
nance at approximately 812.4 GeV/c and the results are
shown in Fig. 3. The top left plot shows the dependence
of Plim and ν on the reference momentum for a vertical
amplitude of 70π mm mrad which, with HERA-p’s cur-
rent one sigma emittance of 4π mm mrad, corresponds
to the amplitude of a 4.2σ vertical emittance. The mo-
mentum range is as in Fig. 2. The low Plim shows that
many perturbing eﬀects interfere in this region. In units
of π mm mrad, the vertical amplitude of the particles
in the top left graph is 70, in the middle graphs it is 40
and 60, and in the bottom graphs 80 and 100. The hori-
zontal scale displays the distance ∆p in GeV /c from the
momentum at the resonance.

In the 4 bottom graphs, Plim and P SRM

lim are plotted
for diﬀerent orbital amplitudes, and the diﬀerent reso-
nance strengths are obtained from the jump in ν(Jy).
Only information about ν was used to compute P SRM
lim .
To allow better comparison, a linear change of P SRM
lim
with momentum was added as a background curve and
the height of the dip was scaled to ﬁt the actual Plim.
The width however was not changed. The distance be-
tween spin tune and resonance has been magniﬁed by 10,
ν∗ = κ + 10(κ − ν) in these graphs. The tune jump is
symmetric around the resonance line ν = 2Qy, showing
that a second-order resonance is excited.

p

As shown in Fig. 3 (top right) the tune jump scales
approximately linearly with the orbital action variable
Jy. This is consistent with the crossing of a second-order
resonance, since a frequency of 2Qy can be produced by
Jye±iQyθ with order larger or equal to
monomials of
2. This linear scaling is not exact for two reasons: (1)
The jump does not reduce to 0 at Jy = 0 but already at
some ﬁnite amplitude at which ν(Jy) does not cross the
resonance line. (2) When the amplitude is changed, the
momentum at which the resonance occurs changes, and
the resonance strength is in general diﬀerent at diﬀerent
energies. Deviations from a linear dependence should
therefore be expected. Plim is already very low away
from the resonance at ν = 2Qy, indicating that other
strong perturbations distort the invariant spin ﬁeld and
can interfere with the resonance harmonic.

Thus we conclude that the resonance width computed
in terms of the tune jump 2ǫκ agrees surprisingly well

7

with the actual drop in Plim.

and 100. ∆p: distance from the momentum at resonance in

Since the higher-order resonances analyzed here show
the established and characteristic relation between tune
jump and reduction of Plim, the applicability of the
Froissart-Stora formula will now be tested.

In Fig. 4 (top) Plim and ν are shown for HERA-p. Plim
is reduced at two resonances with ν = 2Qy. The vertical
tune had been chosen as Qy = 0.2725 so that these res-
onances are crossed already for the small 0.75σ vertical
amplitude of 2.25π mm mrad. At this small amplitude
Plim is reasonably large.

The spins of a set of particles were set parallel to the
invariant spin ﬁeld ~n(~z) so that all had JS = 1 at the
momentum of 801 GeV/c. The ~n-axis had been com-
puted by stroboscopic averaging [15]. Due to the rather
large Plim at that energy the initial polarization was ap-
proximately 97%. Starting with this spin conﬁguration,
the beam was accelerated to 804 GeV/c at various rates.
The average hJSiN over the tracked particles is plotted
versus acceleration rate in Fig. 4 (bottom) together with
the prediction of the Froissart-Stora formula. The av-
erage hJSiN describes the degree of beam polarization
which could be recovered due to the adiabatic invariance
of JS when moving into an energy regime where ~n(~z) is
close to parallel to the vertical.

The resonance strength ǫ2Qy has been determined from
the tune jump. The parameter α is proportional to the
energy increase per turn dE and is determined from the
tune slope ∆ν
∆E in Fig. 4 (top right) by the relation α =
∆ν
1
∆E dE.
2π
The polarization obtained by accelerating particles
through the second-order resonance agrees remarkably
well with the Froissart-Stora formula. For the slow accel-
eration of about 50 keV per turn in HERA-p, the polar-
ization would be completely reversed on the 0.75 sigma
invariant torus. This would lead to a net reduction of
beam polarization, since the spins in the center of the
beam are not reversed.

FIG. 4: Top: Plim and ν for a second-order resonance of
HERA-p with Qy = 0.2725 and a 0.75σ vertical amplitude of
2.25π mm mrad. Bottom: hJSiN after acceleration from
801 GeV/c to 804 GeV/c with diﬀerent acceleration rates
(blue points) and the prediction of the Froissart-Stora for-
mula (red curve) using parameters ǫ2Qy and α obtained from
ν

This result on the applicability of (33) for the reso-
nance strength and α obtained from the amplitude de-
pendent spin tune is so important for detailed analysis of
the acceleration process that it will be checked in another

8

case. In the next example, the same lattice is used, the
tune was adjusted to a realistic value of Qy = 0.289 and
a 4.2σ vertical amplitude of 70π mm mrad was chosen.
At this large amplitude, the second and ﬁfth-order res-
onances already shown in Fig. 2 are observed. Particles
were then accelerated from 812.2 GeV/c to 812.6 GeV/c
with diﬀerent acceleration rates. Note that the initial
condition has a vertical polarization of only 60%. Nev-
ertheless this state of polarization corresponds to a com-
pletely polarized beam, and 100% polarization can poten-
tially be recovered by changing the energy adiabatically
into a region where ~n(~z) is tightly bundled. These stud-
ies emphasize again the importance of choosing ~n(~z) as
the initial spin direction. For example if the spins were
initially polarized vertically, they would rotate around
~n(~z) and that would lead to a ﬂuctuating polarization,
even without a resonance and it would not be possible to
establish a Froissart-Stora formula for higher-order reso-
nances.

As shown in Fig. 5, Plim is as low as 0.11 in the center
of the displayed region. Obviously other strong eﬀects
beyond the second-order resonance are present and over-
lap with it. The bottom ﬁgure shows hJSiN after the
acceleration. The fact that hJSiN is again described very
well by the Froissart-Stora formula (33) is an impressive
conﬁrmation of the conjecture.

The two data points at largest acceleration speed in
Fig. 4 (bottom) are lower than predicted by the Froissart-
Stora formula. A possible explanation is the following:
at very large acceleration speeds the resonance region is
crossed so quickly that the spin motion is hardly dis-
turbed. But when the ~n-axis ~n− before the resonance
region is not parallel to the ~n-axis ~n+ after the resonance
region, then the spins which initially had JS = 1 will ap-
proximately have JS = ~n− ·~n+ after the resonance region
is crossed, which is smaller than the Froissart-Stora pre-
diction, which approaches 1 for large acceleration speeds.
Here the parameter τ was the slowly changing momen-
tum. This generalized way of using the Froissart-Stora
formula can however also be used when other system pa-
rameters change. An example can be found in [35], where
the particle’s phase space amplitude is changed artiﬁ-
cially slowly in order to compute the invariant spin ﬁeld
at various orbital amplitudes. In [10] an example is dis-
played where the Froissart-Stora formula is successfully
applied to a resonance which is encountered because of a
slow variation of Qy.

V. THE CHOICE OF ORBITAL TUNES

When the amplitude-dependent spin tune ν( ~J) of par-
ticles with the amplitude ~J crosses a resonance, for exam-
ple during acceleration, the beam polarization is usually
reduced. It is therefore important to ﬁnd suitable orbital
tunes so that low-order spin-orbit resonances are far away
from the operating point. In particular, when Siberian
Snakes are used to maintain a closed orbit spin tune of 1

ness to the resonance ν = j0 ± 5Qy. For HERA-p with
Siberian Snakes, several simulations have shown that the
resonances of second order and of ﬁfth order are most
destructive. This is supported by Fig. 2. Therefore two
new tunes (blue points) are suggested which have an opti-
mal distance from low-order spin-orbit resonances. It has
been tested experimentally that HERA-p could operate
at these tunes.

FIG. 5: Top: Plim and ν for a second-order resonance of
HERA-p with realistic tune of Qy = 0.289 and a large 4.2σ
vertical amplitude of 70π mm mrad. Bottom: hJSiN after
acceleration from 812.2 GeV/c to 812.6 GeV/c with diﬀer-
ent acceleration rates (blue points) and the prediction of the
Froissart-Stora formula (red curve) using parameters ǫ2Qy and
α obtained from ν

it is important that these Snakes are optimized so that
higher-order resonances do not lead to large deviations
of the amplitude dependent spin tune from this value.
Such optimal choices of snakes are discussed in [29]. The
dominant eﬀects are due to radial ﬁelds on vertical beta-
tron trajectories. Thus Fig. 6 (right) shows the resonance
lines ν = j0 + jQy up to order 10 in the ν-Qy plane. If
the spin tune on the closed orbit is ﬁxed to ν0 = 1
2 by
Siberian Snakes the orbital tune can be chosen to avoid

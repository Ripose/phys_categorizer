JLC PROGRESS

N. Toge, KEK, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0801, Japan

Abstract
The JLC is a linear collider project pursued in Japan by re-
searchers centered around KEK. The R&D status for the
JLC project is presented, with emphasis on recent results
from ATF concerning studies of production of ultra-low
emittance beams and from manufacturing research on X-
band accelerator structures.

INTRODUCTION

Major elements of the current R&D activities for the JLC
project[1] includes: development of polarized electron
sources[2], experimental studies of a damping ring[3], de-
velopment of X-band technologies as the main scheme for
the main linacs, and C-band RF development as a backup
technology for the main linacs[4].

Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of JLC. The target
center-of-mass energy is 250∼500 GeV in phase-I, and ∼1
TeV or higher in phase-II. Since 1998, through an R&D
collaboration (International Study Group – ISG) which was
formalized between KEK and SLAC[5], development of
hardware elements for the X-band main linacs has been
pursued based on the basic parameters common to both
JLC and NLC[6]. Tables 1 and 2 give the most up-to-date
basic machine parameters that have been chosen as a result
of optimization process in ISG discussions.

This paper presents the R&D status of the JLC project,
with strong focus on (i) the most recent results from ATF
concerning studies of production of ultra-low emittance
beams and (ii) manufacturing research on X-band accel-
erator structures.

2 ATF

The Accelerator Test Facility (ATF)[3] at KEK (see Fig-
ure 2) is a test bed for an upstream portion of JLC, which
has to produce a train of ultra-low emittance bunches
of electrons (and positrons).
It includes a multi-bunch-
capable electron source, a 1.54 GeV S-band linac, and a
1.54 GeV damping ring (DR) prototype.

A variety of studies were successfully conducted in 1994
through 1996 on acceleration of multi-bunch beam (up to
12 bunches, 2.8 ns bunch separation). The multi-bunch
beam loading compensation scheme based on the RF fre-
quency modulation of a small set of accelerating structures
was successfully demonstrated.

Commissioning work of the ATF DR began in early
1997 with many participants from both inside and out-
side KEK. The accelerator has been operated in a single-
bunch mode with the typical stored intensity of ∼ 1 × 1010
electron/bunch or less at a repetition rate up to 1.56 Hz.
Achieved and design parameters relevant to operation of
ATF are summarized in Table 3. By Summer 1998, the
horizontal beam emittance ǫx of ∼1.4×10−9m (i.e. γǫx
≃
3.5×10−6 m) was measured by using a group of wire
scanners in the beam diagnostics section of the extraction
line[7].

tion of bunch intensity from ATF.

Some of the development at ATF which are considered to
play important roles in the progress of the achieved vertical
emittance values are summarized as follows:

• Improved resolution (∼20 µm) of single-shot BPM

readout electronics.

• Improved understanding of the ﬁrst order optics in
the DR, and corrections introduced by using “fudge”
factors for the ﬁeld strength of quadrupole magnets
and quadrupole ﬁeld components of the combined-
function bend magnets in the DR.

• Improved dispersion and orbit correction algorithm
which are tuned to minimize the vertical dispersion (∼
5 mm) in the DR without overly upsetting the COD.

• Skew quadrupole magnet ﬁelds were introduced in
the arc sections of the DR by using trim windings of
sextupole magnets. They were used to minimize the
cross-plane coupling by using the x-y coupling sig-
nals in the diagnostics of the ﬁrst-order optics, as well
as by using the tune difference νx-νy near the coupling
resonance.

• Improved algorithm for the correction procedure for
the vertical dispersion in the extraction line, where the
wire scanner beam diagnostics instruments are situ-
ated.

ues that have been achieved at SLAC and ATF, compared
to what are required for injectors of next-generation linear
colliders.

This result from ATF may be put in perspective as shown
in Figure 4. It is seen that the beam emittance that is re-
quired for typical next-generation linear colliders, includ-
ing JLC/NLC, is nearly achieved. However, a number of
issues still remain to be investigated at ATF. For instance,

1. The beam emittance values so far considered the most
reliable have been obtained by using wire scanners
in the extraction line. These and measurements from
synchrotron radiation (SR) monitor in the DR, which
utilizes the interferometry, are not totally consistent.
This is most likely due to effects of mechanical vi-
brations of the optical stands that are used for the SR
monitor system, but it requires more studies.

2. There may be ﬁeld errors in the magnetic components
in the beam extraction line or at the beam extraction
point. They might introduce x-y cross plane cou-
pling and ﬁctitious signals of the growth of the ver-
tical beam emittance, which may not yet be accounted
for in wire scanner measurements.

3. Observed growth of vertical emittance or the emit-
tance ratio as shown in Figure 3 is found to have too
strong a dependence on the bunch intensity, compared
to existing model calculations of intra-beam scatter-
ing effects. It has not yet been resolved whether this
is due to errors in measurements, inadequate set-up
assumptions or true beam dynamics effects.

In addition, the reported emittance numbers from ATF are
so far based only on single-bunch beam operations. After
the Summer shutdown period, the beam operation of ATF

is scheduled to resume in October, 2000. Preparation is
currently under way for addressing the single-bunch emit-
tance issues as well as multi-bunch operation of the ATF
DR.

3 X-BAND ACCELERATING

STRUCTURE

Development of X-band accelerating structure at KEK
has been conducted in close collaboration with a group
at SLAC. The accelerating structure studied is based on
the damped-detuned concept [5]. The recent research fo-
cus at KEK has been on (i) fabrication of copper disks
for the RDDS (Rounded Damped-Detuned) structure with
a diamond-turning technique with ultra-high precision
lathes, and (ii) their assembly into structure bodies by
means of the diffusion bonding technique[5, 9]. They have
been pursued in conjunction with development of better
control of transverse wakeﬁeld and improved RF-to-beam
efﬁciency.

Figure 5: Schematic drawing of an RDDS disk.

Figure 5 shows a schematic drawing of the typical cop-
per disk for the RDDS structure, whose ﬁrst prototype
(RDDS1) was successfully built in 1999 and was tested for
wakeﬁeld characteristics at the ASSET facility of SLAC in
2000. The RDDS1 (1.8 m long) consists of 206 similar
disks, each 61 mm in diameter and 8.737 mm in thickness.
During disk fabrication, much attentions have been paid
to the temperature control of the lathe, positioning of the
diamond cutting tool, and its motion. The radius of the cut-
ting tool are pre-determined within 0.3 µm by machining
an aluminum test hemisphere (φ60 mm) and by measuring
the surface features with a roundness tester. Figure 6 shows
a contour proﬁle plot of a test RDDS disk that was mea-
sured with a CMM (Coordinate Measurement Machine)
with contouring capability. The solid line shows the de-
sign shape, while the black dots show the measured shape,
with the deviation from the nominal shape magniﬁed by
200 times. The machined surface matched the design to
within ±1 µm. Other dimensional parameters such as the
disk outer diameter, aperture radius 2a, which are deter-
mined by the diamond turning, are found to have been done
with similar precision.

In addition to mechanical quality control, careful mea-
surements of the fundamental and ﬁrst-order transverse

mode resonant frequencies of cells were performed for
individual disks. As an example, Figure 7 shows the
fundamental-mode frequencies, measured on a disk-stack
setup (white circles). The disks are mostly fabricated in
the order of the disk number. Figure 7 also shows the in-
tegrated phase error (broken line), expected from the mea-
sured deviation of the fundamental-mode frequencies. It
is seen that by ﬁne-adjusting the cell cavity size (denoted
as 2b in Figure 7) based on the past trend of frequency
errors, the total integrated phase error can be controlled
with an extreme precision. Also, the ﬁrst-order transverse
mode frequencies of the fabricated disks have been found
to have a smooth distribution within 0.4 to 0.6 MHz. Over-
all, the micron-level precision to which the disks are ma-
chined have been very successfully demonstrated.

Disk number(cid:13)

Figure 7: Fundamental mode frequencies, measured in a
disk-stack setup, of RDDS1 disks.

The disks are then stacked on a precision V-block, where
a disk-to-disk alignment of 1 µm or better is possible dur-
ing stacking. A growth of the so-called “bookshelf” stack
errors is prevented by monitoring the inclination angles of
the surface of stacked disks with a two-axis autocollimator
and by applying corrections during stacking.

Formation of the complete accelerating structure is made
through (i) the diffusion bonding procedure of the copper

(cid:13)
(cid:13)
disks that is conducted in two steps (prebonding and ﬁnal
bonding), and (ii) the brazing of external components such
as cooling water tubing, ﬁxtures for support frames, waveg-
uides and ﬂanges.
It has been found repeatedly that the
disk-to-disk alignment and the “bookshelving” error (of its
absense thereof) of the disks are well maintained through-
out the diffusion bonding process, which create vacuum-
tight and mechanically strong enough disk-to-disk bonding
junctions.

However, differential expansion of the ceramics endplate
supports relative to the ﬁrst and the last copper disks lead
to a ﬂaring of the structure ends during diffusion bonding.
Similar deformation occurred on RDDS1 when a stainless
steel manifold was installed on a mid portion of the struc-
ture during brazing. While the former error could be recti-
ﬁed later, the bonding techniques used in the assembly of
X-band structures call for some improvements in the near
future, in addition to studies of mass-production issues.
Results from wakeﬁeld measurements of RDDS1 proto-
type are reported in a contribution submitted to this confer-
ence [9]. Also, issues pertaining to RF processing and high
power operation of X-band accelerating structures at ﬁeld
gradient up to 70∼80 MV/m are being investigated[10].

4 OTHER ACTIVITIES ON THE X-BAND

RF R&D

(PPM)

Development work is also under way[11] for: klystron
modulators with semiconductor switching devices, con-
struction of X-band high-power klystrons with periodic-
permanent magnet
the
DLDS (Delay Line Distribution System) components
(see Figure 8), development of X-band high-power RF
windows[12]. Some of the efforts are carried out in collab-
oration with a group from Protvino branch of BINP, Russia,
as well as with SLAC in the framework of the KEK-SLAC
ISG.

experiment of the DLDS concept was successfully con-
ducted at KEK by a KEK-SLAC-Protvino collaboration in
1999. Another testing is planned for Fall, 2000. A high-
power testing of Protvino-KEK RF windows have been
successfully carried out at SLAC in late 1999 through early
2000. As of August, 2000, intense testing is being con-
ducted on KEK site for a PPM klystron that was designed
at KEK and built in collaboration with Japanese industry.

In a few years, when the basic R&D of these RF compo-
nents, including the accelerating structures, becomes suf-
ﬁciently mature, it is considered highly desirable to build
a small part of the X-band linac, for instance a complete
unit set of the RF system as shown in Figure 8. While its
successful operation without any beam acceleration should
already mark a major milestone, possible acceleration of
low-emittance beams which would be hopefully available
by that time from ATF would play a decisive role in show-
ing the feasibility of JLC/NLC.

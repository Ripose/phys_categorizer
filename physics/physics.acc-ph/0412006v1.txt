A single RF bunch in the KEK proton synchrotron was accelerated with an induction acceleration

method from the injection energy of 500 MeV to 5 GeV.

PACS numbers: 29.20.Dh,29.20.Lq,52.58.Hm

Four years ago, the concept of an induction syn-
chrotron employing induction accelerating devices was
proposed by Takayama and Kishiro [1] for the purpose
of overcoming the shortcomings, such as a limitation
of the longitudinal phase-space available for the ac-
celeration of charged particles in an RF synchrotron,
which has been one of indispensable instruments for
nuclear physics and high-energy physics since the in-
vention by McMillan [2] and Veksler [3]. Accelerating
devices in a conventional synchrotron, such as an RF
cavity, are replaced with induction devices in the in-
duction synchrotron. A gradient focusing force, seen
in the RF waves, is not indispensable for the longitu-
dinal conﬁnement of particles. Pulse voltages, which
are generated at both edges of some time-period with
opposite sign, as shown in Fig. 1, are capable of pro-
viding longitudinal focusing forces. A pair of barrier-
voltage pulses work in a similar way to the RF bar-
rier, which has been demonstrated at FNAL and BNL
[4]. The acceleration and longitudinal conﬁnement
of charged particles are independently achieved with
induction step-voltages in the induction synchrotron.
This notable property of the separated-function in the
longitudinal direction brings about a signiﬁcant free-
dom of beam handling never seen in a conventional RF
synchrotron, in which radio-frequency waves in a reso-
nant cavity simultaneously take both roles of acceler-
ation and longitudinal conﬁnement. Associated with
this separated-function, various ﬁgure of merits are ex-
pected. The formation of a super-bunch, which is an
extremely long bunch with a uniform line-density, and
the use of which is considered in a proton driver for
the second-generation neutrino physics and a future
hadron collider [5], is most attractive.
In addition,
transition crossing without any longitudinal focusing
seems to be feasible [1], which could substantially mit-
igate undesired phenomena, such as bunch shortening

due to non-adiabatic motion and microwave instabil-
ities [6].

The time-duration between barrier-voltage pulses
determines the size of a super-bunch. For accelerating
a super-bunch, a long accelerating step voltage with a
pulse length on the order of µsec is required. The volt-
age has to be generated at the revolution frequency of
the beam in a ring. In the case of a ring-circumference
of 300 m, a repetition rate of 1 MHz is required. So
far, there has been no induction accelerating system
capable of meeting these parameters. Recently, pro-
totype devices, which can generate a 250nsec ﬂat-top
voltage at a repetition rate of cw 1 MHz, have been
assembled at KEK after the 3-year R&D stage, and
combined with the existing RF accelerating system. A
single proton bunch trapped in an RF bucket was ac-
celerated with the induction accelerating system from
500 MeV to 5 GeV during 1.6 sec. In this letter, we
report on the ﬁrst experimental result of the induction
acceleration of a single RF bunch in the KEK proton
synchrotron (KEK-PS) as well as a brief description
of the induction accelerating system.

The key devices required to realize an induction
synchrotron are an induction accelerating cavity [7]
and a pulse modulator driving the cavity [8]. These
devices are notably diﬀerent from similar devices em-
ployed in modern linear induction accelerators [9]. Re-
markable characteristics are its switching characteris-
tics, repetition ratio, and duty factor. Another dif-
ferent feature is that the pulse modulator has to be
kept far from the induction cavity placed in the accel-
erator tunnel, because the solid-state power switching
elements obtainable at present can’t survive an ex-
tremely high radiation dose. Thus, the pulse modula-
tor is connected with the accelerating cavity through
a long transmission cable. In order to reduce reﬂec-
tion from the load, a matching resistance has been

installed at the end of the transmission cable. The
induction accelerating system consists of an induction
cavity with a matching load, a transmission cable, a
pulse modulator, and a DC power supply. A typical
system capable of generating a step-pulse of 2 kV out-
put voltage and 18 A output peak current at 1 MHz
with 50% duty has been demonstrated at KEK. An
equivalent circuit for the induction accelerating sys-
tem is shown in Fig. 2.

The core material of the induction cavity employed
for the ﬁrst acceleration experiment is a nanocrys-
talline alloy, called Finemet (Hitachi Metal). Heat
generated due to core loss is cooled down by insula-
tion oil. The electrical parameters of each unit-cell are
given by the capacitance of 260 pF, the inductance of
110 µH and the resistance of the 330 Ω, which deter-
mine the properties of pulse rising and falling. Three
unit cells with a 2 kV output voltage per unit are
mechanically combined into a single module for the
convenience of installation. Since the inner conductor
with three ceramic gaps is common to three unit-cells,
but both sides of each gap are electrically connected
to the outer edges of each cell, a particle is accelerated
with the same voltage passing these gaps.

A full-bridge

in the pulse-
switching circuit
modulator, which is depicted in Fig. 2, was employed
because of its simplicity. The pulse modulator is capa-
ble of generating bipolar rectangular shaped voltage
pulses. The full-bridge type pulse-modulator consists
of four identical switching arms. Each switching arm
is composed of 7 MOS-FETs, which are arranged in se-
ries. Their gates are driven by their own gate-driving
circuits. The gate signals are generated by converting
light signals provided from the pulse controller, which
is a part of the accelerator control system, to elec-
tronic signals. Its details will be presented elsewhere
[8].

The entire system employed for the current experi-
ment is schematically shown in Fig. 3. The generation
of a 2 kV voltage pulse is directly controlled by trigger
pulses for the switching elements of the pulse modula-
tor, the master signal of which is created in the DSP
synchronizing with ramping of bending magnets, and
gate-driving signal patterns initiated by this master
trigger-signal are generated by the following signal-
pattern generator to be sent to the gate controller of
the pulse modulators through a long coaxial cable.
The DSP counts the B-clock signal, and achieves the
desired revolution frequency. Any delay between the
accelerating pulse and a bunch monitor signal is al-
ways corrected by the DSP. The system is connected
to the existing RF system through the RF signal,
which shares the B-clock signal. As a result, synchro-
nized induction acceleration is guaranteed. Here, the
RF does not contribute to acceleration of the beam
bunch, but gives the focusing force in the longitudi-
nal direction; the beam bunch is in principle trapped
around the phase of zero. The machine parameters
of the KEK PS employed for the experiment are as

2

follows; transition energy γt is 6.63, injection and ex-
traction energy are 500 MeV/8 GeV, revolution fre-
quency f0 is 668 - 877 kHz, RF voltage Vrf is 40 kV
and harmonic number h is 9.

In the experiment, the signals of the bunch mon-
itor and three current transformers (CT), which al-
ways observed the current ﬂow through the matching
resistances, were monitored on a digital oscilloscope
located at the central accelerator control room. Be-
fore the experiment, an actual induced voltage at the
ceramic gap, an output voltage of the transmission
cable, and the CT signal were simultaneously mea-
sured and the correspondence between each other was
well calibrated. In addition, a delayed timing of the
master gate signal triggering the pulse modulator is
adjusted by the DSP so that the bunch signal would
stay around the center of the induction voltage pulse
through the entire accelerating period. Typical wave-
forms of the CT signals are shown in Fig. 4 together
with the bunch signal.

Under coexistence with the RF voltage and the in-
duction voltage, a charged particle receives an energy
gain per turn,

eVacc (t) = e [Vrf sin φ (t) + Vind] ,

(1)

where Vrf and Vind are the RF voltage and the in-
duction voltage, respectively, and φ (t) is the position
of the particle in the RF phase, ωrf t. The orbit and
energy of a particle are dominated by the following
equations:
for the force balance in the radial direc-
tion

= ecβ · B (t) ,

(2)

where B (t) is the bending ﬁeld and ρ is the bending
radius, and for the change in energy

· Vacc (t) .

(3)

From Eq. (2) and (3), the accelerating voltage must
satisfy the relationship Vacc (t) = ρ·C0 ·dB/dt, so that
the particle is synchronously accelerated with ramp-
ing of the bending ﬁeld. The bending ﬁeld is linearly
ramped over 1.7 sec, as shown in Fig. 5. In this linear
ramping region, a Vacc of 4.7 kV is required. In the
present experiment, the induction voltage was ﬁxed to
be 5.28 kV.

In order to conﬁrm the induction acceleration, the
phase signal, which shows the relative position of the
bunch center to the RF, was measured through an
entire accelerating region. Particularly, we focused
on three cases:
(1) with an RF voltage alone, (2)
with an RF voltage and a positive induction volt-
age, and (3) with an RF voltage and a negative in-
duction voltage. From Eq. (1), a theoretical predic-
(Vacc/Vrf ) ∼ Vacc/Vrf = 6.73 de-
tion is φs = sin
grees for case (1), φs = −0.68 degree for case (2),
(2Vacc/Vrf ) ∼ 2Vacc/Vrf = 14.59 degrees
φs = sin

for case (3), where φs represents the position of the
bunch center in the RF phase. Since the induction
voltage is devoted to the acceleration for case (2), the
RF does not serve for acceleration, but takes a role of
capturing alone; thus, the phase must be nearly zero.
In case (3), the RF has to give a two-times larger
energy to the bunch than that in case (1) from the
energy-conservation law; the phase should increase by
a factor of two. Actually, the time-evolution of the
phases and a beam-current for each case has been ob-
served. There were notable diﬀerences between three
cases for the temporal evolution in phase. The beam
itself behaved in the same manner for the three cases
as shown in Fig. 5, where a temporal evolution of the
beam intensity from 500 MeV to 5 GeV is shown.

Before we proceed to an analysis of the experimental
results, we have to pay attention to the phase signal
amplitude, because there were several ambiguities in
our phase pick-up monitoring system, such as time-
varying oﬀset and gain. In order to avoid unknown
factors, we have made a kind of calibration table, from
which the relationship between the monitored phase
pick-up voltage and the exact phase-angle is readable,
by measuring the phase pick-up voltages correspond-
ing to the diﬀerent RF voltages from 40kV to 90kV. In
Fig. 6, the experimental results are shown along with
corrections obtained from a calibration table. For case
(1), the phase is very close to the theoretical predic-
tion. For case (2), the phase is nearly 0 as a rough
estimate. For case (3), the magnitude is higher by
an about factor of two than that of Case (1). At a
ﬁrst glance, we can ﬁnd a qualitative agreement with
the theoretical prediction. Using the calibrated gain
in the linear ramping region from 700 msec to 1.6 sec,
we arrived at Table I, where the results are more quan-
titatively compared with the prediction.

The experimentally obtained phases are slightly dif-
ferent from the theoretically predicted values. A dif-
ference growing near the transition energy may be
attributed to the fact that the RF bunch becomes
shorter when approaching the transition energy; as
a result, the eﬀective acceleration voltage in this re-
gion sensitively depends on the relative position in the

3

induction voltage with a droop. Meanwhile, we real-
ize that a diﬀerence between the accelerating voltage
pulse-shape and the decelerating voltage pulse-shape,
which can be seen in Fig. 4, gives a slightly asym-
metric evolution around Case (1). From the over-all
experimental results and their analysis, we conclude
that a single RF bunch was accelerated from 500 MeV
up to 5 GeV with the induction accelerating device,
as expected.

The present induction voltage wave-form has a
droop of 10-15% over 250 nsec, although it has not
been discussed. To achieve a uniform acceleration of
the super-bunch, ﬂatness in the wave-form is impor-
tant. Several methods [11] to compensate the droop
have been proposed. They will be tried at the KEK
PS. Following the original scenario of the POP experi-
ment to realize an induction synchrotron [1], hereafter,
we will proceed to its next step in the formation of a
super-bunch by the induction step-barriers.

It is emphasized that for the ﬁrst time charged par-
ticles in a high-energy accelerator ring were acceler-
ated with an induction accelerating system. The ex-
perimental fact of induction acceleration in a circular
ring and the reality that the key devices developed for
this purpose, such as a pulse modulator as a switching
driver, are on our hands as big mile-stones for us to
achieve an induction synchrotron in the near future,
and a super-bunch hadron collider in the no-so-far fu-
ture. Last, it is emphasized that the induction system
worked well through the entire operating period of 24
hours without any trouble.

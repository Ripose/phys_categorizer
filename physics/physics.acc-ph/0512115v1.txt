Abstract. We apply the Smaller ALignment Index (SALI) method to a 4–dimensional mapping of accelerator dynamics in
order to distinguish rapidly, reliably and accurately between ordered and chaotic motion. The main advantage of this index
is that it tends exponentially to zero in the case of chaotic orbits, while it ﬂuctuates around non–zero values in the case
of quasiperiodic trajectories. Thus, it avoids the notorious ambiguities concerning the eventual convergence of (maximum)
Lyapunov exponents to (positive) non-zero values. Exploiting the different behavior of SALI in these two cases we produce
phase space ‘charts’ where regions of chaos and order are clearly identiﬁed. Evaluating the percentage of chaotic and escaping
orbits as a function of the distance from the origin we are able to estimate rapidly and accurately the boundaries of the
dynamical aperture of a proton beam, passing repeatedly through an array of magnetic focusing elements.

INTRODUCTION

One of the basic problems in accelerator physics is
the determination of the stability regions (islands of
quasiperiodic motion) of a particle beam, as well as its
dynamical aperture, i.e the domain about the ideal circu-
lar path in which the particles’ motion remains bounded
[1]. In the case of ‘ﬂat’ hadron beams, where the horizon-
tal (x-) motion is dominant, 2–dimensional (2D) area–
preserving mappings are frequently used to model the
effect of nonlinearities as the particles repeatedly pass
through focusing magnetic elements [2], or experience
the beam-beam interaction with particles of a colliding
beam [3]. The presence of invariant curves around the
origin of such mappings (corresponding to the particle’s
ideal circular orbit), guarantees the long–time stability
of the beam. In that case, the chaotic motion that exists
between these invariant curves remains always bounded
and so the beam particles do not escape to inﬁnity. On
the other hand, in the case of ‘elliptical’ bunched hadron
beams, where the vertical (y-) and longitudinal (z-) mo-
tion cannot be neglected and which are modelled by
k = 2M–dimensional symplectic mappings with M > 1,

chaotic regions can be connected, providing a path for
the orbits to move away from the origin and eventually
escape to inﬁnity. This practically means the loss of par-
ticles in the storage rings of the accelerator and hence a
reduction of the beam’s dynamical aperture.

In the present paper, we face the problem of the es-
timation of the dynamical aperture of a 4D symplectic
mapping, which describes the motion of a hadron parti-
cle as it passes through a magnetic focusing element of
the FODO cell type. This system has already been stud-
ied in [4, 5, 6, 7]. In particular Vrahatis et al. [7] tried
to approximate invariant tori existing as far away from
the origin as possible by computing stable periodic or-
bits of very high period. Their idea was that the corre-
sponding islands of stability and the quasiperiodic ‘tori’
around these periodic orbits could play the role of an ef-
fective barrier of orbital diffusion, although their pres-
ence does not exclude the possible ‘leaking’ of chaotic
orbits to large distances from the origin.

A more direct approach to the problem of estimating
the size of the dynamical aperture, is the actual charac-
terization of orbits on a ﬁne grid around the origin as or-
dered or chaotic (escaping or not escaping to inﬁnity). In
this way one can determine the region about the ideal cir-
cular path where predominantly ordered orbits exist, thus
guaranteeing the stability of the beam, at least up to the
number of iterations that the orbits have been computed.

This approach requires the use of a fast and reli-
able method which can distinguish between ordered and
chaotic motion rapidly, reliably and accurately. The usual
method of the computation of the maximal Lyapunov ex-
ponent [8, 9] does not meet these requirements as the
number of iterations needed for the convergence of the
Lyapunov exponent to its actual (zero or positive) value
is not known a–priori and may become very high. There-
fore, the application of this procedure to a huge num-
ber of initial conditions becomes impractical and its ef-
ﬁciency as a tool for studying the dynamical aperture of
particle beams seems seriously doubtful . For these rea-
sons, we prefer apply to our system the Smaller ALign-
ment Index (SALI) method [10, 11, 12, 13], which has
been proved to be an efﬁcient, reliable and very fast
method of chaos detection.

THE SALI METHOD

The SALI method was introduced in [10] and has already
been applied successfully to distinguish between ordered
and chaotic motion in various mappings and Hamiltonian
systems [11, 12, 13], as well as problems of Celestial
Mechanics [14, 15], Galactic Dynamics [16, 17], Field
Theory [18] as well as non–linear lattices [19, 20].

In order to recall the deﬁnition of the SALI let us con-
sider the k-dimensional phase space of a conservative dy-
namical system, e. g. a 2M–dimensional symplectic map-
ping or a Hamiltonian ﬂow of N degrees of freedom, with
k = 2N. In a symplectic mapping the evolution of an or-
bit with initial condition X(0) = (x1(0), x2(0), . . . xk(0)),
k = 2M is governed by the discrete–time equations of the
mapping, having the form

X(n + 1) = F(X(n)),

(1)

where X(n) = (x1(n), x2(n), . . . , xk(n)) is the orbit’s lo-
cation at the n–th iteration of the mapping. On the other
hand, in a Hamiltonian ﬂow, the motion of an orbit with
initial condition X(0) = (x1(0), x2(0), . . . xk(0)), k = 2N
is governed by Hamilton’s equations of motion, which
have the general form

dX(t)
dt

= F(X(t)),

(2)

where X(t) = (x1(t), x2(t), . . . , xk(t)) is the orbit’s posi-
tion in the phase space at time t.

Suppose we wish to determine the chaotic vs. ordered
nature of an orbit X(n) of a symplectic mapping (or X(t)
of a Hamiltonian system) with initial condition X(0).
To do so, one traditionally follows the evolution of one
deviation vector V (n) = (dx1(n), dx2(n), . . . , dxk(n)) (or
V (t)), which can be considered as initially pointing to
an orbit nearby the one under study, and computes the

orbit’s maximal Lyapunov exponent [8, 9]. In the case of
mappings the evolution of such a deviation vector V (n)
is governed by the equations of motion of the so–called
tangent map:

V (n + 1) = DF(X(n)) ·V (n),

(3)

while, in the case of Hamiltonian ﬂows we use the set
of linear ordinary differential equations called variational
equations:

dV (t)
dt

= DF(X(t)) ·V (t),

(4)

where DF denotes the Jacobian matrix of equations (1)
or (2) evaluated at the points of the orbit under study.
Since, in the present paper, we study symplectic map-
pings, our notation from now on will be restricted to dif-
ference equations, although the following concepts can
be easily extended to the case of differential equations
describing Hamiltonian ﬂows.

For the evaluation of the SALI we follow the time evo-
lution of two initially different deviation vectors V1(0),
V2(0) and deﬁne SALI [10] as:

SALI(n) = min{k ˆV1(n) + ˆV2(n)k, k ˆV1(n) − ˆV2(n)k} (5)

where k · k denotes the usual Euclidean norm and ˆVi,
i = 1, 2 are normalized vectors with norm equal to 1,
i. e. ˆVi(n) = Vi(n)/kVi(n)k.

Two different behaviors of SALI are thus distin-

guished:

1. If the orbit under study is chaotic, the two vectors
ˆV1(n), ˆV2(n) tend to coincide (or become opposite)
along the most unstable direction (corresponding
to the maximal Lyapunov exponent). In this case,
SALI tends exponentially to zero following a rate
which depends on the difference between the two
largest Lyapunov exponents [13].

2. If the orbit is ordered (quasiperiodic), there is no
unstable direction and vectors ˆV1(n), ˆV2(n) tend to
become tangent to the corresponding torus, having
in general different directions. In this case SALI re-
mains different from zero, ﬂuctuating around some
mean value [12]. An exception to this behavior ap-
pears for ordered orbits of 2D mappings where the
SALI tends to zero following a power law (see [10]
for more details).

The simplicity of SALI’s deﬁnition, its completely dif-
ferent behavior for ordered and chaotic orbits and its
rapid convergence to zero in the case of chaotic motion
are the main advantages that make SALI an ideal chaos
detection tool, perfectly suited for multidimensional con-
servative systems, such as proton (antiproton) beams in
accelerator storage rings.

describing the instantaneous sextupole nonlinearities ex-
perienced by the dynamics of a proton beam as it passes
repeatedly through magnetic focusing elements of the
FODO cell type [4, 5, 6, 7]. Here x1 and x3 are the par-
ticle’s horizontal and vertical deﬂections from the ideal
circular orbit of the beam, x2 and x4 are the associated
momenta and w 1 and w 2 are related to the accelerator’s
tunes qx, qy by

w 1 = 2p qx , w 2 = 2p qy.

(7)

Let us ﬁrst examine the behavior of the SALI for some
individual orbits. Vrahatis et al. [7] have computed near
the boundary of escape of the mapping several stable pe-
riodic orbits of very long period, as well as some invari-
ant tori near them. In Figure 1(a) we see the projection
into the x1 − x2 − x3 space of one such ordered orbit of
the mapping (6) for qx = 0.61803 and qy = 0.4152 ﬁrst
presented in ﬁgure 1(b) of [7]. This orbit is generated by
a small perturbation in qx of the stable periodic orbit of
period 13237 found in [7] for qx = 0.61903 and it lies on
8 tori in the x1 − x2 − x3 space. The exact values of the
orbit’s initial condition, which will be denoted from now
2(0), x∗
on as X ∗(0) = (x∗
4(0)), can be found
in table 3 of [7]. Following [8, 9], we may compute the
maximal Lyapunov exponent l 1, of the orbit as the limit
for n → ¥ of the quantity

where V (0), V (n) are deviation vectors from the orbit at
n = 0 and n > 0 iterations respectively. We recall that
l 1 = 0 for ordered orbits, while l 1 > 0 for chaotic orbits.
The ordered nature of the orbit is clearly revealed by the
evolution of its SALI (Figure 1(b)) and of its L1 (Figure
1(c)). The SALI remains different from zero ﬂuctuating
around 10−2.5 converging to this value long before L1
becomes zero. Thus, as far as SALI is concerned, the
computation could have been stopped after about 10000
iterations, concluding correctly that the orbit is ordered.

By changing the x1 coordinate of the initial condition
of the orbit of Figure 1, to x1 = 0.624 we get the weakly
chaotic orbit plotted in Figure 2(a), surrounding the 8 tori
of Figure 1(a). This behavior is clearly seen in Figure

2(b) where we project on the x1 − x2 plane the points
of Figures 1(a) and 2(a) with |x3| ≤ 0.04. The SALI of
the chaotic orbit decreases rapidly to zero, after a tran-
sient initial phase (Figure 2(c)) reaching the limits of the
computer’s accuracy (i. e. 10−16) after about n = 20000
iterations, showing clearly the chaotic nature of the or-
bit. We can of course set a less demanding threshold for
the SALI’s values in order to deﬁne an orbit as chaotic.
Considering for example as such a threshold the value
SALI ≈ 10−8, we can characterize the orbit as chaotic
after only 8000 iterations. For the same number of iter-
ations, L1 (Figure 2(d)) does not seem to converge to a
non–zero value, so that many more iterations are needed
for the deﬁnite characterization of the orbit as chaotic by
the use of the maximal Lyapunov exponent. In fact, at
about 10000 iterations the maximal Lyapunov exponent
gives an erroneous picture, as it starts to fall to values
closer to zero!

In Figure 3(a) we see the projection into the x1 −
x2 − x3 space of a chaotic orbit near the edge of the
beam’s dynamical aperture, with initial condition X ∗(0)
for qx = 0.628615, qy = 0.4152, which escapes to inﬁnity
after about n = 82000 iterations. Again, the SALI rapidly
determines the chaotic nature of the orbit as it becomes
less than 10−8 after about n = 12000 iterations (Figure
3(b)), while L1 continues to decrease showing no sign
of convergence to a non–zero value, until after 32000
iterations (Figure 3(c)).

This fundamentally different behavior of the SALI for
ordered (Figure 1(b)) and chaotic orbits (Figures 2(c) and
3(b)) and its rapid determination allows us to perform
efﬁciently a more ‘global’ study of the dynamics of
mapping (6) in order to estimate the region of stability
around the origin.

As a ﬁrst step in that direction, let us compute, up
to n = 105 iterations, a great number of orbits whose
x1(0) coordinate varies from 0 to 0.9 with a step equal
to 10−4, while x2(0), x3(0), x4(0) are the same as in the
stable orbit of Figure 1. In Figure 4 we plot the SALI
of each orbit (after n = 105 iterations) as a function of
the initial coordinate x1(0). We note that chaotic orbits
which escape in less than n = 105 iterations are charac-
terized as escaping orbits and are not plotted in Figure
4. From Figure 4 we see that orbits with x1(0) ≤ 0.54
are ordered, having SALI > 10−4, except for a tiny inter-
val around x1(0) ≈ 0.39 where one ﬁnds chaotic orbits
having SALI ≈ 10−9. The region 0.54 . x1(0) . 0.59 is
occupied mainly by chaotic orbits having SALI values
less than 10−8 and is followed by a region of mainly or-
dered motion for 0.59 . x1(0) . 0.79. For larger values
of x1(0) chaos dominates while escaping orbits that are
not plotted in Figure 4 appear for x1(0) & 0.83.

Since we are interested after all in global picture of the
dynamics around the origin, it is convenient to use the
SALI method for ‘charting’ this region. Let us consider

orbit escapes before the ﬁnal number n of iterations is
reached it will be characterized as an escaping orbit.

We ﬁrst restrict our study to the 2–dimensional con-
ﬁguration plane x1 − x3 in order to be able to visual-
ize our results. In particular, we consider orbits on a
400 × 400 grid mesh uniformly covering the rectangu-
lar region −1 ≤ x1(0) ≤ 1, −1 ≤ x3(0) ≤ 1, keeping
ﬁxed the x2(0), x4(0) values. The corresponding ‘charts’
are plotted in Figure 5 for x2(0) = x4(0) = 0 (Figures
5(a),(b)) and for x2(0) = x4(0) = 0.1 (Figures 5(c),(d)).
The orbits were followed for n = 104 (Figures 5(a),(c))
and n = 105 (Figures 5(b),(d)) iterations in order to un-
derstand the evolution of ‘charts’ with respect to the
number of iterations. In Figure 5 the initial conditions
corresponding to chaotic orbits are plotted in black while
the ones corresponding to ordered orbits are plotted in
gray. In all panels of Figure 5 all non–colored points cor-
respond to escaping orbits.

From the comparison of panels (a) and (b), and pan-
els (c) and (d) of Figure 5 we see that the region occu-
pied by non–escaping orbits (ordered and chaotic ones)
does not practically change as the number n of iterations
increases. This means that most of the escaping orbits
ﬂy away from the central region very fast, after a small
number of iterations. So, the initial conditions plotted by
black and gray color in Figure 5 deﬁne the region of sta-
bility around the beam’s circular motion in the sense that
all these orbits do not escape. We also see that in all pan-
els of Figure 5 the region around the origin corresponds
to ordered motion, while chaotic orbits exist mainly at
the borders of the stability region. As the number of it-
erations increases, the number of chaotic orbits also in-
creases. This happens because weakly chaotic orbits lo-
cated at the borders of the region of ordered motion re-
veal their chaoticity later on as their SALI needs more
iterations in order to become less than 10−8. Thus, al-
though the number of non-escaping orbits remain practi-

104 (gray curves) and n = 105 (black curves) iterations. The
percentages of escaping orbits do not change signiﬁcantly as
the number of iterations increases and so the corresponding
curves practically coincide.

cally constant the percentage of this number that corre-
sponds to chaotic orbits increases as n grows.

Considering orbits with initial conditions uniformly
distributed around the origin within a ‘volume’ of the
full 4–dimensional phase space, we now perform a more
global analysis of orbital stability. As we cannot produce
plots like the ones of Figure 5 for the 4–dimensional
space, we present in Figure 6 the percentages of the
various types of orbits within spherical shells of width
dr = 0.01 inside a 4–dimensional hypersphere of radius
r = 1 centered at the origin. We note that by the distance
r of an initial condition (x1(0), x2(0), x3(0), x4(0)) from
the origin (0, 0, 0, 0) we refer to the quantity

r = qx2

1(0) + x2

From the results of Figure 6 we see again that the number
of escaping orbits does not change signiﬁcantly as the
number n of iterations increases, while the percentage
of chaotic orbits increases with n. An estimation of the
radius of the dynamical aperture therefore gives r ≈ 0.55,
as up to that distance from the origin no escaping orbits
are found. Of course, for 0.4 ≤ r ≤ 0.55 there exists a
signiﬁcant amount of non–escaping chaotic orbits. So
r ≈ 0.4 is a reasonable estimate of the maximal radius
of a 4–dimensional hypersphere around the origin, where
orbits not only do not escape to inﬁnity but, in addition,
are also ordered.

x2(0) = x4(0) = 0 for panels (a) and (b) and x2(0) = x4(0) =
0.1 for panels (c) and (d). In all frames, initial conditions
are colored black if their SALI ≤ 10−8 and gray if SALI >
10−8. The uncolored initial conditions correspond to orbits that
escape in less than n iterations.

CONCLUSIONS

In the present paper, we have applied the method of
the Smaller Alignment Index (SALI) to the character-
ization of orbits of a 4D symplectic mapping describ-
ing the dynamics of a proton beam passing repeatedly
through magnetic focusing elements of the FODO cell
type. Thus, we have been able to locate efﬁciently is-
lands of ordered motion, layers of weak chaos, as well as
estimate accurately the beam’s dynamical aperture.

The success of this approach lies in the fact that it
can rapidly distinguish between ordered and chaotic mo-
tion in Hamiltonian ﬂows and symplectic mappings of
any dimensionality. Since the SALI decays exponen-
tially to zero in the case of chaotic orbits (and oscillates
quasiperiodically around non-zero values in ordered re-
gions), it bypasses the slow and often irregular conver-
gence properties of the computation of Lyapunov expo-
nents and thus provides quickly a deﬁnite characteriza-
tion of each orbit.

This allows one to use the SALI to characterize whole
domains in phase space of different scales and sizes and
‘chart’ them as chaotic or regular. Carrying out such a
study for the mapping of this paper, we have been able
to ‘trace out’ the dynamical aperture of proton beams
with a 2-dimensional (x and y) cross section, by locat-
ing 4-dimensional domains, where non-escaping behav-
ior is guaranteed even after a very high number of it-
erations. Currently, we are extending our work to more
realistic 6-dimensional mappings, where longitudinal (or
synchrotron) oscillations are taken into consideration and
space charge effects are included [21]. Despite the addi-
tional complications present in these models, we believe
that the SALI method will again be able to yield useful
results, ‘charting’ correctly the dynamics of phase space
domains that would otherwise be very difﬁcult to probe
efﬁciently by more traditional techniques.

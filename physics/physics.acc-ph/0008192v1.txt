Abstract
We present a ground motion model for the SLAC site. This
model is based on recent ground motion studies performed
at SLAC as well as on historical data. The model includes
wave-like, diffusive and systematic types of motion. An
attempt is made to relate measurable secondary properties
of the ground motion with more basic characteristics such
as the layered geological structure of the surrounding earth,
depth of the tunnel, etc. This model is an essential step in
evaluating sites for a future linear collider.
INTRODUCTION

1

In order to accurately characterize the inﬂuence of ground
motion on a linear collider, an adequate mathematical
model of ground motion has to be created. An adequate
model would require an understanding of the temporal and
spatial properties of the motion and identiﬁcation of the
driving mechanisms of the motion. Eventually these must
be linked to more general properties of a site like geology
and urbanization density. In this paper, we consider one
particular model based on measurements performed at the
SLAC site [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. We use this model to illustrate ex-
isting methods of modeling, as well as potential problems
and oversimpliﬁcations in the modeling techniques. In our
particular case, the representation of the cultural noise, es-
pecially that generated inside the tunnel, is difﬁcult to in-
corporate. However, the model provides a foundation to
which many additional features can be added.

In general, the ground motion can be divided into ‘fast’
and ‘slow’ motion. Fast motion (f >∼ a few Hz) cannot
be adequately corrected by a pulse-to-pulse feedback op-
erating at the repetition rate of the collider and therefore
results primarily in beam offsets at the IP. On the other
hand, the beam offset due to slow motion can be compen-
sated by feedback and thus slow motion (f <∼ 0.1) results
only in beam emittance growth. Another reason to divide
ground motion into fast and slow regimes is the mechanism
by which relative displacements are produced that appears
to be different with a boundary occuring around 0.1 Hz. In
the following, we will ﬁrst describe the ‘fast’ motion and
then we will present the ‘slow’ motion which includes both
diffusive and systematic components.

2 FAST GROUND MOTION

Modeling of the ground motion requires knowledge of the
2-D power spectrum P (ω, k). The fast motion is usually
represented by quantities that can be measured directly: the
spectra of absolute motion p(ω) and the correlation c(ω, L)
which shows the normalized difference in motion of two
points separated by distance L. The spectrum of relative

motion p(ω, L) can be written as p(ω, L) = p(ω)2(1 −
c(ω, L)) which in turn can be transformed into P (ω, k) [9].
Measurements [2, 6] show that the fast motion in a rea-
sonably quiet site consists primarily of elastic waves prop-
agating with a high velocity v (of the order of km/s).
The correlation is then completely deﬁned by this velocity
(which may be a function of frequency) and by the distri-
bution of the noise sources. In the case where the waves
propagate on the surface and are distributed uniformly in
azimuthal angle, the correlation is given by c(ω, L) =
hcos(ωL/v cos(θ))iθ = J0(ωL/v) and the correspond-
ing 2-D spectrum of the ground motion is P (ω, k) =
2p(ω)/p(ω/v(f ))2 − k2, |k| ≤ ω/v(f ).

The absolute power spectrum of the fast motion, as-
sumed for the SLAC model, corresponds to measurements
performed at 2 AM in one of the quietest locations at
SLAC, sector 10 of the linac [2], (see Fig.1). The spa-
tial properties are deﬁned by the phase velocity found from
correlation measurements v(f ) = 450 + 1900 exp(−f /2)
(with v in m/s, f in Hz) [2].

motion for the 2 AM SLAC site ground motion model.

We believe that the frequency dependence of the mea-
sured phase velocity v(f ) is explained by the geological
structure of the SLAC site where, as is typical, the ground
rigidity and the density increase with depth. The surface
motion primarily consists of transverse waves whose

phase velocity is given by vs ≈ pE/(2ρ) and which are

localized within one wavelength of the surface.
If one
plots the quantity v2/λ versus wavelength λ, we see that
this value is almost constant, varying from 3000m/s2 at
λ = 100m to 2000m/s2 at λ = 1000m. This is consistent
with a ground density at the SLAC site that ranges from
1.6 · 103 within the upper 100 m to 2.5 · 103kg/m3 at a
kilometer depth and a Young’s modulus E which increases
from 109Pa at 100 m to 1010 Pa at 1000 m. These results
seem to be quite reasonable for the SLAC geology, and, as
we will see below, they also agree with explanations of the
observed slow motion.

3 SLOW GROUND MOTION

Based on the arguments above, the wavelength at frequen-
cies below 0.1 Hz quickly becomes much larger than the
accelerator and eventually exceed the earth’s size. In this
case, the motion has little effect on the accelerator and at
some point the notion of waves is not really applicable.
Causes other than the wave mechanism must be responsi-
ble for producing relative misalignments that are important
at low frequencies. Such sources include the variation of
temperature in the tunnel, underground water ﬂow, spatial
variation of ground properties combined with some exter-
nal driving force, etc. These causes can produce misalign-
ments with rather short wavelength in spite of their low fre-
quencies.

The ATL model of diffusive ground motion [7] is an at-
tempt to describe all these complex effects with a simple
rule which states that the variance of the relative misalign-
ment ∆X 2 is proportional to a coefﬁcient A, the time T
and the separation L: ∆X 2 = AT L. In the spectral repre-
sentation this rule can be written as P (ω, k) = A/(ω2k2).
It has been shown [10] that this rule adequately describes
available measured data in many cases, however, typically
only spatial or temporal information, but not both, was
taken for a particular data set. Measurements where good
statistics were collected, both in time and space and in a
relevant region of parameter space, are sparse and difﬁcult
to perform. Thus, detailed investigation of slow motion is
an urgent issue for future studies.

The diffusive component of the ground motion model
considered is based on measurements of slow motion per-
formed at SLAC. First, measurements performed in the
FFTB tunnel using the stretched wire alignment system
over a baselength of 30 m give the value of A ≈ 3 ·
10−7µm2/(m·s) on a time scale of hours [3]. Second, a
48 hour measurement of the linac tunnel motion performed
with the linac laser alignment system over a baselength of
1500 m gave A ≈ 2 · 10−6µm2/(m·s) [4]. Finally, re-
cent measurements using a similar technique were made
over a period of one month and show that A ≈ 10−7–
2 · 10−6µm2/(m·s) for a wide frequency band of 0.01–
10−6Hz [5].
In the latter case, the major source of the
slow 1/ω2 motion was identiﬁed to be the temporal vari-
ations of atmospheric pressure coupled to spatial variations
of ground properties [5]. The atmospheric pressure was
also thought to be responsible for a slow variation of the
parameter A.

The clear correlation of atmospheric pressure variation
with deformation of the linac tunnel, observed in [5], can
only be explained if one assumes some variation of the
ground properties along the linac. This variation can be
due to changes in the Young’s modulus E, changes in
the topology such that the normal angle to the surface
changes by ∆α, or changes in the characteristic depth h
of the softer surface layers. A rough estimate of the tunnel
deformation due to variation of atmospheric pressure ∆P
can be expressed as

The observed deformation of the tunnel ∆Y = 50µm cor-
responding to ∆P = 1000 Pa is consistent with this es-
timation if ∆E/E∼0.5, ∆α ∼0.5 or ∆h/h∼0.5 and if
one assumes E/h ∼ 107Pa/m. The former assumption
is consistent with the heterogeneous landscape and geol-
ogy at SLAC while the latter appears to agree well with the
properties of the ground determined in the previous SLAC
correlation measurements, if one assumes that h ∼ λ.
No direct conclusions can be drawn from the measure-
ments [5] to determine the spatial behavior of the observed
slow motion because the relative motion was only mea-
sured for one separation distance. However, the topology
of many natural surfaces (including landscapes) exhibits a
1/k2 behavior of the power spectra [11]. Thus, it seems
reasonable to expect that temporal pressure variation can
also be a driving term of the spatial ATL-like motion. Fur-
thermore, the measured parameter A can be extended from
1500 m to a shorter scale, without contradicting the very
short baseline measurements [3] which produced a similar
value of A.

It is also worth noting that the contribution to the param-
eter A driven by the atmosphere scales as 1/E2 or as v4
and therefore strongly depends on geology. Thus, the pa-
rameter A, at a site with a much higher vs, would not be
dominated by atmospheric contributions, while a site with
softer ground and a vs half that at SLAC, may have a pa-
rameter A as high as 3 · 10−5µm2/(m·s).
Finally, very slow motion, observed on a year-to-year
time scale at SLAC, LEP, and other places, appears to be

where there is limited data, this spectrum can be charac-
terized as Psyst(t, k) ≈ Asystt2/k2 with the parameter
Asyst ≈ 4 · 10−12µm2/(m·s2) for early SLAC. An estimate
of the rms misalignment due to this systematic motion is
then ∆X 2 = AsystT 2L. One can see that the transition
between diffusive and systematic motion would occur at
Ttrans = A/Asyst which in our case, assuming the value
A = 5 · 10−7µm2/(m·s) for the diffusive component of
the SLAC ground motion model, would happen at about
Ttrans ≈ 105 s.
The SLAC ground motion model includes all of the fea-
tures that we have described. The transition from the ‘fast’
to the ‘slow’ motion is handled in a manner described in
Ref. [9]. The absolute spectrum p(ω) and the spectrum
of relative motion p(ω, L) are shown in Fig. 1. The sys-
tematic motion is not seen in this ﬁgure as it corresponds
to much lower frequencies. However, it is seen in Fig. 5
where the rms ∆X is calculated for L = 30 m by di-
rect modeling of the ground motion using harmonic sum-
mation [15]. One can see that this curve can be divided
into three regions: wave dominated (T <∼ 10 s), ATL-
dominated (10 <∼ T <∼ 105 s) and systematic motion domi-
nated (T >∼ Ttrans ∼ 105 s).
This ground motion model is included in the PWK mod-
ule of the ﬁnal focus design and analysis code FFADA [13]
which can perform analytical evaluations using the model
spectra. The model is also included in the linac simulation
code LIAR [14] where the summation of harmonics is used
for direct simulations of the ground motion.

4 CONCLUSION

We have presented a model of ground motion for the SLAC
site. This model includes fast, diffusive and systematic mo-
tion with parameters that are consistent with the known ge-
ological structure of the SLAC site. It is being now used to
study the performance of the various systems in the Next
Linear Collider.

systematic in time, i.e. ∆X 2 ∝ T 2 [12]. For example,
measurements of the SLAC linac tunnel between 1966 and
1983 [1] show roughly linear motion in time with rates up
to 1mm/year in a few locations along the linac. Subsequent
measurements indicate that the rate of this motion has de-
creased over time although the direction of motion is still
similar as is illustrated in Fig. 2. In the case of SLAC, the
motion may have been caused primarily by settling effects,
while in LEP, the cause may more likely be something dif-
ferent such as underground water [12].

The temporal dependence of earth settlement problems

typically are approximated as:

∆y

(1 + 2pt/τ )! exp(−2.36 t/τ ) (2)

∆ymax ≈ 1− 1 − pt/τ
where the typical value of τ is years. This type of solu-
tion exhibits √t motion at the beginning which then slows
and exponentially approaches ∆ymax. An example of such
a dependence is compared with the motion observed at
SLAC in Fig. 2. One can see that the early SLAC sys-
tematic motion can be also described reasonably well by
a linear in time motion, though nowadays the rate of the
motion should be already much lower.

The spatial characteristics of this systematic motion also
seem to follow the 1/k2 (or ∆X 2 ∝ L) behavior. This
is evident in the displacements of the SLAC linac [1] af-
ter 17 years which is shown in Fig. 3. The correspond-
ing spatial spectrum is shown in Fig. 4 and it follows
1/k2 in the range of λ from 20–500m. Although there
is deviation from the 1/k2 behavior at long wavelengths

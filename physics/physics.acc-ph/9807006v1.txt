100 GeV “First Muon Collider”, the exact energy taken to
be representative of the actual mass of a Higgs particle.

Proton Driver The speciﬁcation of the proton driver
for the three machines is assumed the same: 1014 pro-
tons/pulse at an energy above 16 GeV and 1-2 ns rms bunch
lengths. There have been three studies of how to achieve
them. The most conservative, at 30 GeV, is a generic de-
sign. Upgrades of the FNAL (at 16 GeV) and BNL (at
24 GeV) accelerators have also been studied. Despite the
very short bunch requirement, each study has concluded
that the speciﬁcation is attainable. Experiments have been
done and are planned to conﬁrm some aspects of these
designs.[3]

Abstract

Besides continued work on the parameters of a 3-4 and
0.5 TeV center of mass (CoM) collider, many studies are
now concentrating on a machine near 100 GeV (CoM) that
could be a factory for the s-channel production of Higgs
particles. We mention the research on the various com-
ponents in such muon colliders, starting from the proton
accelerator needed to generate pions from a heavy-Z tar-
get and proceeding through the phase rotation and decay
(π → µ νµ) channel, muon cooling, acceleration, storage
in a collider ring and the collider detector. We also men-
tion theoretical and experimental R & D plans for the next
several years that should lead to a better understanding of
the design and feasibility issues for all of the components.
This note is a summary of a report[1] updating the progress
on the R & D since the Feasibility Study of Muon Colliders
presented at the Workshop Snowmass’96.[2]

INTRODUCTION

Unlike protons, muons are point like but, unlike electrons,
they emit relatively little synchrotron radiation and there-
fore, can be accelerated and collided in rings. As a result,
a muon collider with a given energy reach could be smaller
than either a proton or electron machine. A 3 TeV muon
collider (with effective energy comparable with that of an
SSC) would ﬁt on existing sites, such as BNL or FNAL
(see Figs.1, 2). Another advantage resulting from the low
synchrotron radiation is the lack of beamstrahlung and the
possibility of very small collision energy spreads. A beam
energy of ∆E/E of 0.003 % (equivalent to a CoM spread of
∆E/E of 0.002 %) is considered feasible for a 100 GeV
machine; and it has been shown that by observing spin
precession, the absolute energy could be determined to a
small fraction of this width. These features become impor-
tant in conjuction with the large s-channel Higgs produc-
tion (µ+µ− → h, 43000 times larger than for e+e− → h),
allowing precision measurements of the Higgs mass, width
and branching ratios.

Such machines are clearly desirable. The questions are:

• whether they can be built and physics done with

them

• what will they cost.

Much progress has been made in addressing the ﬁrst ques-

tion and the answer, so far, appears to be positive.
too early yet to address the second. We have studied ma-
chines with center of mass energies of 100 GeV, 400 GeV
and 3 TeV, deﬁned parameters and simulated many of their
components (see Tb.1). Most work has been done on the

Muon Production Pion production has been taken
from the best models available, but an experiment (BNL-
E910) that has taken data, and is being analyzed, will re-
ﬁne these models.[4] The assumed 20 T capture solenoid
appears to be well within current technology (a coil with
the speciﬁed ﬁeld and aperture is now nearing completion
at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Florida
State University). Capture, decay and phase rotation have
been simulated, and have achieved the speciﬁed production
of 0.3 muons per initial proton. The most serious remaining
questions for this part of the machine are:

1. The nature and material of the target: The base-
line assumption is that a liquid metal jet will be used,
but the effects of shock heating by the beam, and of
the eddy currents induced in the liquid as it enters the
solenoid, are not yet fully understood.

2. The maximum RF ﬁeld in the phase rotation. For
the short pulses used, the current assumptions would
be reasonably conservative under normal operating
conditions, but the effects of the massive radiation
from the nearby target are not known.

Both these questions can be answered in a target experi-
ment planned to be performed within the next two years at
AGS.[5]

Cooling The required ionization cooling is the most
difﬁcult and least understood element in any of the muon
colliders studied. Ionization cooling is a phenomenon that
occurs whenever there is energy loss in a strong focus-
ing environment. Such an environment has existed, for
instance, in the iron toroid muon calorimeters of several
neutrino experiments, and a Monte Carlo simulation has
shown[6] that cooling must have occured there. But achiev-
ing the nearly 106 reduction required is a challenge. Cool-
ing over a wide range has been simulated using lithium
lenses and ideal (linear matrix) matching and acceleration;
and examples of limited sections of solenoid lattices with
realistic accelerating ﬁelds have now been simulated. But
the speciﬁcation and simulation of a complete system has
not yet been done. Much theoretical work remains: space
charge and wake ﬁelds must be included; lattices at the
start and end of the cooling sequences must be designed;
lattices including liquid lithium lenses must be designed
and studied, and the sections must be matched together and
simulated as a full sequence. The tools for this work are
nearly ready, and this project should be completed within
two years.[7]

Technically, one of the most challenging aspects of the

cooling system appear to be:

• High gradient RF (e.g. 36 MV/m at 805 MHz) oper-
ating in strong (5-10 T) magnetic ﬁeld, with beryllium
foils between the cavities.

An experiment is planned that will test such a cavity, in the
required ﬁelds, in about two years time. On an approxi-

mately six year time scale, a “Cooling Test Facility” is be-
ing proposed that could test ten meter lengths of different
cooling systems.[8] If they are required, there is the need
to develop:

• Lithium Lenses: (e.g. 2 cm diameter, 70 cm long,
liquid lithium lenses with 10 T surface ﬁelds and a
repetition rate of 15 Hz).

They may not be needed for the low energy “First Muon
Collider”, which would ease the urgency of this rather long
term R & D. Meanwhile a short lithium lens is under con-
struction at BINP (Novosibirsk, Russia).

Acceleration The acceleration systems are probably
the least controversial, although possibly the most expen-
sive, part of a muon collider. Preliminary parameters have
been speciﬁed for acceleration sequences for a 100 GeV
and 3 TeV machines, but they need reﬁnement. In the low
energy case a linac is followed by three recirculating ac-
celerators. In the high energy accelerator, the recirculat-
ing accelerators are followed by three fast ramping syn-
chrotrons employing alternating pulsed and superconduct-
ing magnets. The parameters do not appear to be extreme,
and it does not appear as if serious problems are likely.

Collider The collider lattices are challenging because
of their required very low intersection betas, high single
bunch intensities, and short bunch lengths (see Tb.1); how-
ever, the fact that all muons will decay after about 1000
turns means that slowly developing instability are not a
problem. Feasibility lattices have been generated for a
4 TeV case, and more detailed designs for 100 GeV ma-
chines studied. In the latter case, but still without errors,
5σ acceptances in both transverse and longitudinal phase
space have been achieved in tracking studies. Beam scrap-
ing schemes have been designed for both the low energy
(collimators) and high energy (septum extractors) cases.

is needed to remove the

stabilities (beam breakup) should be controlled by rf BNS
damping.

The heating of collider ring superconducting magnets by
electrons from muon decay can be controlled by thick tung-
sten shields, and this technique also shields the space sur-
rounding the magnets from the induced radioactivity on the
inside of the shield wall. A conceptual design of magnets
for the low energy machine has been deﬁned.

Although much work is yet to be done (inclusion of er-
rors, higher order correction, magnet design, rf design, etc),
the collider ring do not appear likely to present serious
problems.

Neutrino Radiation and Detector Background Neu-
trino radiation, which naturally rises as the cube of the en-
ergy, is not serious for machines with center of mass ener-
gies below about 1.5 TeV. It is thus not signiﬁcant for the

First Muon Collider; but above 2 TeV, it sets a constraint
on the muon current and makes it harder to achieve desired
luminosities. However, advances in cooling, and correc-
tion of tune shifts may still allow a machine at 10 TeV with
substantial luminosity (> 1035 cm−2s−1).

Background in the detector was, at ﬁrst, expected to be
a very serious problems. But after much work, shielding
systems have evolved that limit most charged hadron, elec-
tron, gamma and neutron background to levels that are ex-
pected to be acceptable. Muon background, in the higher
energy machines, is a special problem that can cause seri-
ous ﬂuctuations in calorimeter measurements. It has been
shown that fast timing and segmentation can help suppress
this background, and preliminary studies of its effects on
a physics experiment are encouraging. The studies are
ongoing.[9]

3 SUMMARY

Much progress has been made since Snowmass, but much
still needs to be done. A time scale of two years should al-
low completion of simulation studies, and the experimental
testing of crucial technical challenges. Prototype construc-
tion and testing will be required for another 4-6 years. The
construction of a “First Muon Collider” by about 2010 does
seem to be possible.

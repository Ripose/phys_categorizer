SIMULATION OF AN INTRA-PULSE INTERACTION POINT FEEDBACK

FOR FUTURE LINEAR COLLIDERS

D. Schulte, CERN, 1211 Geneva, Switzerland

Abstract
In future normal-conducting linear colliders, the beams
will be delivered in short bursts with a length of the or-
der of 100 ns. The pulses will be separated by several ms.
In order to maintain high luminosity, feedback is neces-
sary on a pulse-to-pulse basis. In addition, intra-pulse feed-
back that can correct beam positions and angles within one
pulse seem technically feasible. The likely performances
of different feedback options are simulated for the NLC
(Next Linear Collider [1]) and CLIC (Compact Linear Col-
lider [2]).

INTRODUCTION

A vertical position displacement between the beam centres
at the interaction point (IP) will cause luminosity reduc-
tion. Two main sources of beam jitter at the interaction
point IP are expected. Firstly, the beam entering the ﬁnal
focus system may jitter in angle and position. At the IP,
the resulting vertical position error, normalised to the beam
size, and the resulting angle error, normalised to the beam
divergence, are expected to have the same size. Secondly,
transverse jitters of the ﬁnal focus magnets, especially of
the ﬁnal doublet, will mainly change the position of the
beams at the IP, not so much the angle. The jitter at the IP
can thus be described by

(cid:18) h(∆y)2i

σ2

y (cid:19) =  h(∆y ′)2i

y ′ ! +(cid:18) h(∆f f sy)2i

σ2
y

σ2

(cid:19) .

Here, ∆y and ∆y ′ are the offset and angle error of the beam
at the IP, σy and σy ′ are beam size and divergence, also at
the IP. ∆f f sy is the contribution to the position error due to
the ﬁnal focus system. If it is large, the effect of the angle
at the IP can be neglected.

2 BEAM-BEAM INTERACTION

When the beams collide with a vertical offset, they will re-
ceive a strong kick from the beam-beam interaction. The
angle of the outgoing beam can therefore be used to mea-
sure the relative positions of the beams. The dependence of
kick angle and luminosity on the position and initial angle
have been simulated with the program GUINEA-PIG [3],
varying both parameters.
The luminosity L as a frac-
tion of the nominal L0, is shown in Fig. 1, as a function
on the relative beam position error and beam angle error.
The kick angle is shown in Fig. 2 as a function of the off-
set. If the beams collide without an offset but with an an-

gle, their initial angle is roughly preserved in the beam-
beam interaction. For comparison: the beam divergence is

CLIC.

3 POSITION FEEDBACK MODEL

In order to have a fast correction, corrector and beam-
position monitor (BPM) need to be located close together.
Here, they are located on the same side of the IP at a dis-
tance of 1.5 m, see Fig. 3. Thus the correction is not ap-

plied to the measured beam but to the other one. This sig-
niﬁcantly reduces the time necessary to transport the signal
from the BPM to the kicker. The feedback response time
τd is given by

τd = τp + τk + τpf + τkf + τs

(1)

Here, τp is the time the BPM electronics needs to measure
the beam offsets and to process the data, τk is the response
time of the kicker and τs is the transport time of the signal
from BPM to kicker. τpf and τkf are the times of ﬂight
from the IP to the BPM and from the kicker to the IP, re-
spectively. In the following, a total of τd = 20 ns is as-
sumed, half of which is due to τpf + τkf . The pulse lengths
are 100 ns in CLIC and 266 ns in NLC.

The hardware for this feedback has not yet been de-
signed. With a solid state ampliﬁer it should be possible
to correct an offset of 2σy [4], with an additional stage of
tube ampliﬁcation this may even be extended to 20σy [5].
It is assumed that the feedback changes the beam posi-

tion by δy after each measured bunch according to

δy = g

for a measured angle θ. The gain factor g is chosen to give
optimal performance. The additional crossing angle, that
results from the correction is orders of magnitude smaller
than the beam divergence and can be neglected.

4 RESULTS OF POSITION FEEDBACK

Here, only position errors are considered. First NLC is dis-
cussed. In Fig. 4, the luminosity loss with a beam offset
∆y = 2σy is shown as a function of the gain g. As can be
seen, g = 0.06 seems a good choice. Very small gains lead
to a slow correction, very large ones to an over-correction.
Both result in a larger luminosity loss. With g = 0.06, the
luminosity loss is reduced by a factor 6, compared to the
case without feedback. For a smaller offset of ∆y = 1/8σy
about the same factor is found.

Two main sources of noise can lead to an increased lumi-
nosity loss with feedback: a bunch-to-bunch position jitter
of the incoming beam, and the position resolution of the

BPM. For the chosen gain g = 0.06, the additional loss in-
duced by the feedback is very small, compared to the case
without feedback. To estimate the required BPM resolu-
tion, simulations are performed with perfect beams and a
position error of the BPM of σBP M = 15 µm for a single
bunch. The luminosity loss, averaged over 100 cases, is
only ∆L/L = 0.7 × 10−3. The limit on the BPM resolu-
tion seems therefore not to be very stringent compared to
the resolutions that must be achieved in other parts of the
machine.

For a very large offset of ∆y = 12σy, the luminosity
without feedback, is only 3.5% of the nominal value. If the
feedback has the required correction range, it can recover
73% of the full luminosity. For the experiment, this can
make the difference between a complete failure and still
acceptable running conditions.

For CLIC, the machine with a centre-of-mass energy of
1 TeV is simulated. At higher energies, Ecm = 3 TeV or
Ecm = 5 TeV, a large number of electrons and positrons
will be produced during the collision of the two beams, in a
process called coherent pair creation [6]; already at Ecm =
3 TeV, the number of these particles is about 20 % of the
number of beam particles. They induce a strong signal in
the BPM, and due to their large angle could even hit it.
Their properties need to be studied in detail before one can
suggest a feedback for the high energy machines.

In CLIC at Ecm = 1 TeV, the feedback response time
is assumed to be the same as in NLC. With the optimum
gain g = 0.005, the luminosity loss is reduced by a factor
3. This is not as good as in NLC, since the bunch trains
are shorter in CLIC. A BPM resolution of σBP M = 15 µm
leads to a luminosity loss of only ∆L/L = 1.2 × 10−4.
This is better than in NLC because of the lower gain and
the slightly larger kick angle for an offset of ∆y = σy.

5 INFLUENCE OF ANGLES

If the beams at the IP have angle jitters, this reduces the
luminosity. In addition, the BPM measures the additional
angle and the feedback tries to correct a non-existing off-
set. The latter problem can be solved by measuring the in-
coming beam angle error and subtracting it from the value
measured by the feedback. Two options are discussed in
reference [7], one suggested by M. Breidenbach. Both have
some difﬁculties and neither correct the angle error, but
only its effect on the position feedback. As shown below,
this is not sufﬁcient, because the luminosity loss will stay
large. If the angle jitter is signiﬁcant, an additional angle
feedback is needed for each beam, as described below.

6 ANGLE FEEDBACK MODEL

Each angle feedback consists of a BPM and a strip-line
kicker which are placed in the beam delivery section before
the detector, see Fig. 5. This assumes that the angle jitter is
created before this system, as is to be expected. The BPM

has to be at a phase advance of (n + k + 1

where an angle error at the IP can be measured as a position
error. The kicker has to be closer to the IP, at nπ, to be able
to transport the signal in the same direction as the beam.
Here, the angle at the IP can be corrected by applying a
kick. One needs large beta-functions, at the BPM to have a
good signal, and at the kicker to have a smaller divergence
and thus correction angle. Possible positions exist in the
beam delivery system [8]. The kick angles have to be sig-
niﬁcantly larger than for the offset feedback [7], and it may
be difﬁcult to achieve this.

This feedback is relatively simple, and uses a constant
gain for each bunch. The response time τd is given by equa-
tion (1). In the present case τpf is negative, since the beam
reaches the BPM before the IP. With signal transmission at
the speed of light, one would obtain τs + τpf + τkf = 0 and
consequently τd = τp + τk. In the following, τd = 15 ns is
assumed.

7 RESULTS OF ANGLE FEEDBACK

The angle feedback is simulated for NLC. The optimum
gain is determined in the same way as for the position feed-
back. If only angle errors were present, the luminosity loss
would be reduced by a factor 6, as for the position feed-
back.

The required resolution for the BPM depends on the ver-
tical beta-function at its position. It must correspond to a
resolution of the beam angle in the IP of 0.2σy ′, to achieve
a luminosity loss of only ∆L/L = 10−3 for perfect beams.

Finally, the combination of angle and position error is
considered. Figure 6 shows the fractional luminosity loss
for a constant beam position error of ∆y = 2σy as a func-
tion of the angle error. If no feedback is used, the luminos-
ity loss is high. An additional angle error can increase it
even more. If only a position feedback is used, which does
not correct the angle error of the incoming beam, the lu-
minosity loss is small as long as the angle errors are small.
If ∆y ′/σy ′ becomes comparable to ∆y/σy, the loss is al-
most the same as without feedback. If one measures the
incoming angle, and subtracts it from the measured value,
the situation does not improve very much. If ﬁnally, a po-
sition feedback at the IP and an angle feedback for each
beam are used, the luminosity loss is signiﬁcantly reduced,
independent of the initial angle error.

8 CONCLUSION

If the appropriate hardware can be built, the intra-pulse
feedback at the interaction point offers a reduction of the
luminosity loss due to pulse-to-pulse jitter by a factor of
about 6 in NLC and 3 in CLIC. Even in case of a very
large offset of 12 times the beam size, more than 70 % of
the luminosity is recovered in NLC. Without feedback the
luminosity would be almost zero.

If the angle jitter is signiﬁcant, it is not sufﬁcient to cor-
rect the measured kick angle accordingly. To reduce the
luminosity loss due to the angle errors, the described angle
feedback is necessary. Whether it is feasible needs to be
studied.

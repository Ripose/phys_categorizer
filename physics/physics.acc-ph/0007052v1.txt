Design Studies for a High Current Bunching System for CLIC Test Facility

(CTF3) Drive Beam

Y. Thiery, J. Gao, and J. Le Duff, LAL, Orsay, FRANCE

Abstract
A bunching system is proposed for the initial stage of CTF3
which consists of one (two) 3 GHz prebuncher(s) and one
3GHz travelling wave (TW) buncher with variable phase
and group velocities. The electron beam is emitted from a
140 KV DC gun. Since the average macropulse beam cur-
rent (3.5 A) at the exit of the TW buncher is rather high,
inside the TW buncher one has to take the beam load-
ing effect into consideration. By using PARMELA, it is
shown numerically that the bunching system can provide
the bunches which properties satisfy the design require-
ment of CTF3. The 0.8 meter long TW buncher working at
2π
3 mode has two phase velocities, β = 0.75 and β = 1.
The dimensions of the cavities in the two phase velocity
regions are proposed by considering the beam loading ef-
fect. The transient beam loading effect and the multibunch
transverse instabilities are studied numerically. It is con-
cluded that higher order mode (HOM) couplers should be
installed in the TW buncher with the loaded quality factor
of the dipole mode lower than 80.

INTRODUCTION

CLIC is a two beam accelerator (TBA) based e+e− linear
collider. As other linear collider projects, such as NLC,
JLC, and TESLA, CLIC evolves in terms of its concep-
tions and technologies. The recently proposed CLIC drive
beam scheme [1] makes CLIC more interesting. To demon-
strate the feasibility of the new drive beam scheme and to
test other technical aspects, CTF3 [2] has been proposed
as a natural successor of the existing CTF2 to which LAL
has actively collaborated and contributed in the past years
[3][4]. In this paper we will restrict oursevles to the study
of the bunching system for CTF3 which is a new subject of
collaboration between LAL and CLIC group of CERN.

The bunching system under study consists of a 140 KV
DC gun, one (two) prebuncher(s) of 3 GHz for the initial
stage and one TW buncher of 3 GHz. The design means
choosing bunching system layout, parameters, and numer-
ical simulations. In the following sections we will discuss
the design of the travelling wave buncher considering the
beam loading effect, the numerical simulations of the pro-
posed bunching system by using PARMELA, the multi-
bunch longitudinal and transverse beam dynamics in the
TW buncher with the presence of long range wakeﬁelds.

2 BEAM LOADING EFFECT

We start with the power diffusion equation in a linac

dP (z)

dz

= −2α(z)P (z) − IE(z)

(1)

where P (z) is the power ﬂow inside the structure, E(z) is
the amplitude of the synchronous accelerating ﬁeld, and I
is the average beam current during the rf pulse. By using
the initial condition E(0) = E0, one gets:

E(z) = E0 exp(−αz) sin(φ)−IRsh(1−exp(−αz)) (2)
where Rsh(z) is the shunt impedance of the accelerating
mode, E0 = √2αP0Rsh and P0 is the input power from
the rf source, Rsh(z) and α(z) are kept constant within the
accelerating structure, φ = π/2 corresponds to the max-
imum acceleration, and this expression was ﬁrst obtained
by A.J. Lichtenberg [5].

To have good energy transfer efﬁciency and energy gain
at the same time, one requires (fully beam loading condi-
tion):

E(L) = 0

(3)

where L is the length of the accelerating section. When
the ohm loss on the structure wall is small the fully beam
loaded condition results in

P0 =

IE0L

2

(4)

For a given E0, I, and L, one gets P0 from eq. 4 and one
can determine the geometry of the disk-loaded structure by
solving the following equations:

E 2

P0

ωRsh
vgQ

c(vg/c)

(5)

where k010 and vg/c can be expressed analytically as
[6][7]:

k010 =

where the deﬁnitions of a, h, R, D, and d are given in
Fig. 1. Now we make a rough design for the TW buncher
working at 3 GHz and 2π/3 mode. If one takes E0 = 10
MV/m, R = 0.04 m, I = 4 A, L = 0.8 m, one ﬁnds
P0 = 16 MW and the structure dimensions given in Table
1. The structure has two sections with phase velocities β =
0.75 and β = 1, respectively. The number of the cells of
β = 0.75 is four which has been determined by the beam
dynamics simulations of PARMELA.

3 BEAM DYNAMICS

The design goal and the layout of the bunching system are
shown in Fig. 2, and in Fig. 3 [8][9]. A multibunch beam
dynamics study shows that for the ﬁnal phase of CTF3
the dipole mode in the TW buncher has to be damped to
QL,110 ≤ 80 as shown in Fig. 4. By using PARMELA
one gets the bunched beam parameters at the exit of the
TW buncher. Limited by the space we show the simula-
tion results in Fig. 5 only for the case of single prebuncher.
The DC current coming from the cathode is 7 A and during
2π, 500 particles has been tracked. For the observing win-
dow of 20 degree centered around the bunch current peak,
one gets: 322 particles, the normalized rms emittance is 51
mm.mrad, the rms energy spread is 0.12 MeV, the energy
of the reference particle is 3.8 MeV, and the longitudinal
rms bunch length is 4.4 ps. In future simulations two fully
beam loaded structures will be added after the TW buncher
to push the beam energy up to about 26 MeV.

4 CONCLUSION

In this paper we have given a preliminary design for the
TW buncher. By using PARMELA the bunching system
consisting one (two) prebuncher(s) and a TW buncher has
been simulated and the results are satisfactory. More sim-
ulations will be done to determine how many prebunchers
are to be used and to include two accelerating sections to
accelerate the beam to about 26 MeV. Multibunch beam dy-
namic simulation results show that higher order mode cou-
plers should be installed on each cell of TW buncher with
the loaded quality factor of the dipole mode lower than 80.

Abstract

When a relativistic electron bunch traverses a structure,
strong electric ﬁelds are induced in its wake. We present
measurements of the electric ﬁeld as a function of time as
measured at a ﬁxed location in the beam line. For a 12 nC
bunch of duration 4.2 ps FWHM, the peak ﬁeld is measured
> 0.5 MV/m. Time resolution of ∼5 ps is achieved using
electro-optic sampling with a lithium tantalate (LiTaO3)
crystal and a short-pulse infrared laser synchronized to the
beam. We present measurements under several different
experimental conditions and discuss the inﬂuence of mode
excitation in the structure.

INTRODUCTION

Since the pioneering experiments [1–3], electro-optic sam-
pling (EOS) has been shown to be a powerful technique for
fast time-domain measurements of electric ﬁelds [4, 5].

The use of electro-optic sampling for accelerator appli-
cations has been previously suggested by [6–8] and others.
Detection of the beam current by magneto-optic effects has
been demonstrated by [7] with a time resolution that is sub-
nanosecond.

Recently, at Brookhaven, electro-optic detection of a
charged particle beam was reported by detecting a faint
light pulse through crossed polarizers as the beam passed
by an electro-optic crystal [9]. The time resolution possi-
ble here is limited by the speed of the photodetectors and
ampliﬁers, which similar to that available with capacitive
beam pickups (∼100 ps). Earlier at Brookhaven, an RF
phase measurement using the electro-optic effect and phase
stabilization by feedback was demonstrated [10].

We have used electro-optic sampling to measure the
electric ﬁeld waveforms in vacuum induced by the passage
of electron bunches with an estimated time resolution of
∼5 ps, limited by the laser pulse length [11, 12].
Independently of our work, a group at FOM Rijnhuizen
(Nieuwegein, The Netherlands) has used electro-optic sam-
pling in ZnTe to resolve the sinusoidal electric ﬁeld of
the free electron laser FELIX at the optical frequency
(λ = 150 µm) [13]. Of note is the rapid-scanning cross-
correlation technique (a fast data-acquisition trick). The
same group has sampled the electric ﬁeld of the transition
radiation from the electron beam exiting a beryllium win-
dow [14] and the electric ﬁeld in vacuum [15] from which

the bunch length is measured.

We have thus far been unable to reproduce their results

with ZnTe; we suspect a problem with our crystal.

2 EXPERIMENT

The linear electro-optic effect (or Pockels effect) is one of
several nonlinear optical effects that arise from the second-
order susceptibility tensor χ(2), and is described in many
standard texts, such as [16]. For our purposes, it suf-
ﬁces that the polarization of light is altered by an electric
ﬁeld applied to the crystal. By analyzing the polarization
change, the electric ﬁeld can be measured. Using a short
laser pulse and a thin crystal, the electric ﬁeld is sampled
at a particular time Ti when the laser pulse arrives at the
crystal. By changing the delay of the probe laser arrival
time, and repeatedly measuring the electric ﬁeld, the elec-
tric ﬁeld waveform is recovered by electro-optic sampling.
The data acquistion is handled by LabVIEW and a digital
oscilloscope.

Experiments were performed at the AØ Photoinjector of
Fermilab [17, 18]. A lamp-pumped Nd:glass laser system
built by the University of Rochester is quadrupled to UV
(λ = 263 nm) for photocathode excitation. The UV pulses
are temporally shaped to an approximate ﬂat-top distribu-
tion with a 10.7 ps FWHM. Unconverted infrared light is

the probe laser for the electro-optic sampling, so that jit-
ter between the beam and the probe laser vanishes to ﬁrst
order. The photoinjector produces 12 nC bunches with
normalized emittance of 20π mm-mrad (uncompressed) in
pulse trains up to 200 pulses long with interpulse spacing
1 µsec. A chicane of four dipoles was used for magnetic
compression. In a companion paper in these proceedings
we present some compression studies. The best compres-
sion to date is σz = 0.63 mm (1.89 ps) for a charge of
13.2 nC, which gives a peak current of 2.8 kA.

We have taken data using several different conﬁgura-
tions. The elements common to all of the setups are a po-
larizer, the crystal, the compensator, and another polarizer
(analyzer). The ellipsometry can be simpliﬁed for perfect
polarizers and small polarization changes in the crystal. For
two detectors A and B (silicon photodiodes) after the ana-
lyzer, the intensity measured at IA ≡ A is:

A = Io sin2(δΓ + φ)

(1)

where the intensity incident on the analyzer is Io, and φ
is a constant which represents the compensator and/or the
static birefringence of the crystal (φs = ω(no − ne)L/c).
The term proportional to the electric ﬁeld is δΓ = ωδn L/c,
and putting in the electro-optic coefﬁcient for LiTaO3 with

the electric ﬁeld along the 3-axis, we ﬁnd

δΓ =

For the electric ﬁeld along the 2-axis of LiTaO3,
electro-optic coefﬁcient is δΓ = ωn3
o r22 E2L/c. It is clear
from Equation 1 that if φ = 0, then for small signals,
A ∝ Io(δΓ)2.
The second detector B measures the orthogonal polar-
ization component, so B = Io cos2(δΓ + φ). It is seen that
for a choice of φ = π/4,

A − B

= sin δΓ ∼ δΓ ∝ E

independent of Io. The compensator then is used to balance
the detectors in the absence of electro-optic modulation.
However, the static birefringence is a function of tempera-
ture, so we make one further subtraction to cancel drifts to
form the experimental Γ.

Γ = (cid:18) A − B

A + B(cid:19)signal− (cid:18) A − B

(4)

For the background points, a shutter is closed which blocks
the UV for the photocathode but allows the infrared probe
laser to go to the crystal. The ﬁeld magnitude is estimated
by calibrations on a duplicate crystal on the bench. A
ﬁeld E3 = 100 kV/m induces a rotation Γ = 0.046 rad,
while E2 = 100 kV/m induces Γ = 0.003 rad, all for the
7×8×1.5 mm LiTaO3 crystal (thickness L = 1.5 mm).

3 RESULTS

With the sensitive axis of the crystal oriented so that E3 =
(Ez +Eθ)/√2, using the convention that the electron beam
velocity deﬁnes the +z direction, the measured waveform
in shown in Figure 2. The initially surprising feature is the
presence of strong oscillations that persist beyond the end
of the delay stage (3 ns). These are attributed to excitation
of modes in the structure, and an FFT of the waveform is
shown in Figure 3. We can, for example, identify the fre-
quencies near 3 GHz as trapped modes in the 6-way cross
[19].

With the sensitive axis of the crystal oriented so that
E3 = Er, the measured waveform is quite different, being
nearly sinusoidal (Figure 4). In the cylindrical beam pipe
(radius b = 2.2 cm), there is a propagating (waveguide)
TM1,1 mode with frequency ν = (3.83)c/2πb = 8.4 GHz,
and it may be the origin of the observed 8.8 Ghz compo-
nent. The slow build-up (and beat near 1900 ps) in the
envelope could be explained by a small splitting of this
mode into two frequencies, which are initially out of phase.
The FFT (ﬁgure 5) suggests a splitting, but the resolution
(limited by the length of the scan) is poor. More will be
presented and discussed in a future publication. A second
round of experiments is planned with the goal of detecting
the direct Coulomb ﬁeld of the bunch.

The direct Coulomb ﬁeld of the bunch, if detected, is
simply connected with the charge distribution ρ(z) with
sensitivity to head-tail asymmetries. As the electro-optic
effect has a physical response at the femtosecond level,
the technique of electro-optic sampling could be a valuable
method for bunch length measurements at the < 100 fs
level. The transient (wake) ﬁelds we measured off-axis
could be applied to on-axis measurements of the wake
function and beam impedance. Higher-order mode cou-
pling and damping in structures may also be of interest.

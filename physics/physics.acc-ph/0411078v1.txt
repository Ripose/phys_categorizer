Abstract

The International Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) is devoted to a
study of a muon cooling channel capable of giving the desired performance for a Neu-
trino Factory. One of the goals is achieving an absolute accuracy of measurements of
emittance reduction as high as
0.1%. The paper describes results of a Monte Carlo
study on allowed density variations of liquid hydrogen corresponding to the desired
accuracy of the measurements.

1 Introduction

An experiment which allows the investigation of the performance of a muon cooling chan-
nel at different conditions of interest has been designed by MICE collaboration [1]. In par-
ticular, high precision measurements of emittance reduction are planned to be performed
0.1%. Various factors should be taken into account to achieve the
with an accuracy of
desired accuracy. One of the essential parameters is material density of the liquid hydrogen
in the absorber. The density is inﬂuenced by temperature and pressure of the hydrogen kept
within pre-determined tolerances. The Monte Carlo study with the MARS14 code [2] was
undertaken to calculate the dependence of the emittance reduction on hydrogen density at
realistic conditions. The results can be used to determine the above-mentioned tolerances
corresponding to the desired accuracy of measurements.

2 Basic Formulae

In a four-dimensional phase space with coordinates x, px, y, py, the normalized emittance
of a muon beam, e n, can be calculated according to the expression [3]

To generate a proper muon beam distribution in the system, symmetry considerations
are taken into account [4]. Firstly, Gaussian distributions are modeled for x, px, y, py in the
geometrical center of the absorber, where magnetic ﬁeld ﬂips, using information on the
b -function distribution in the channel [1]. Secondly, backward muon transport is modeled
in the magnetic ﬁeld and without the material (hydrogen and aluminum) to get a reﬂected
incoming muon distribution in front of the absorber. And thirdly, regular muon transport
through the absorber is modeled.

3 Geometry Model

Realistic geometry of the 35-cm liquid hydrogen absorber along with ’inﬂected’ window
design [1, 5] was implemented in the model (see Fig. 1). The absorber is inside a solenoid
which is taken into account via its magnetic ﬁeld only. Thickness of the aluminum windows
of the absorber is variable with the thinnest parts being on the z-axis.

Realistic three-dimensional distributions of magnetic ﬁeld over the cooling channel
were taken from Ref. [6]. The longitudinal and radial solenoidal ﬁeld distributions as im-
plemented in the MARS model are shown in Fig. 2.

4 Calculated Results

The Monte Carlo calculations were performed for 200-MeV/c incident muons at various
densities of the liquid hydrogen. Results of the calculations are shown in Fig. 3. Statistical
uncertainty (1s ) of the calculations was about 0.02% which is less than the linear size of
the symbols used in the Figure.

of the cooling channel for 200-MeV/c muons [1]. Here 100% corresponds to 0.0708 g/cm3.

One can see that a variation as high as 2% in hydrogen density gives rise to a 0.1%
n. Therefore, to ensure the desired accuracy of emittance measurements,

variation in D
tolerance for the density of the liquid hydrogen should not exceed 2%.

5 Conclusions

Monte Carlo calculations were performed on emittance reduction of a muon beam vs hy-
drogen density for a MICE liquid hydrogen absorber within realistic absorber geometry and
with detailed three-dimensional distribution of magnetic ﬁeld. It was shown that, within
the range of interest, the density dependence is clearly linear. To ensure the accuracy of
emittance measurements as high as 0.1%, tolerance for the hydrogen density should be less
than 2%.

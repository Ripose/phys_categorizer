Abstract. A conceptual program to use NLC beams for test beams and ﬁxed target
physics is described. Primary undisrupted polarized beams would be the most simple to
use, but for NLC, the disrupted beams are of good enough quality that they could also
be used, after collimation of the low energy tails, for test beams and ﬁxed target physics.
Pertinent issues are: what is the compelling physics, what are the requirements on beams
and running time, and what is the impact on colliding beam physics running. A list of
physics topics is given; one topic (Møller Scattering) is treated in more depth.

I

INTRODUCTION

During the last 10 years, colliding beam physics with the SLC/SLD was SLAC’s
main program. During most of the SLC colliding beam running, SLAC was also
engaged in a highly successful ﬁxed target program. The main emphasis was on the
spin content of the nucleon (E-142 [1] and E-143 [2] at 30 GeV, and E-154 [3] and E-155
[4] at 50 GeV), but other fundamental experiments like E-144 also ran [5]. Typically
two months per year were set aside from the main program. Test beams [6]) were
used parasitically for smaller experiments (E-146, [7]) and for detector development,
in particular GLAST [8].

This report discusses the possibilities for using the NLC [9] primary electron
beam for ﬁxed target physics or to produce secondary hadron test beams. While
dedicated operation of a ﬁxed target program is obviously the most eﬃcient, we will
assume that test beam or ﬁxed target running is done in parallel with colliding beam
physics. Other design conditions are that there must be permitted access to the ﬁxed

target and test beam experimental building during colliding beam operation, there
should be useful hadron and electron yields up to about 80% of the primary beam
energy, and a single beam transport line and experimental area can be used for both
tests and ﬁxed target running.

Figure 1 shows possible locations of such test beam and ﬁxed target beam fa-
cilities: they could be at the end of the electron linac (dedicated running only), or
behind either IP following the NLC extraction line. The scheme shown is based on
the current NLC design of a low energy IR (up to 500 GeV center of mass (cms),
i.e., 250 GeV per beam), and a high energy IR (up to 1 TeV cms) expandable to
higher energies. To keep the option for multi-TeV beams open, the beam path to the
high energy IR has minimal bends; this requires that the linacs have a small angle of
20 mrad between them to enable the outgoing bunches to be separated from the

≈
incoming beam.

Test beam or ﬁxed target facilities could be attached behind either of the IR’s or at the end of the
electron linac.

Figure 2 shows a schematic layout of the NLC low energy IR extraction line,
including the 5 MW water beam dump, and the proposed test beam and ﬁxed target
take-oﬀ. For colliding beam physics the beam dump intercepts both the disrupted,
primary electrons and the beamstrahlung γ’s. For test beams, a 0.3 radiation length
Be target is placed in the disrupted beam for production of secondary e−, π−, K−,
¯p (or their anti-particles). To extract the primary beam for ﬁxed target physics, a
dipole is placed at the location of the Be target to bend the beam into the secondary
transport line. The dipole aperture must be large enough so as not to intercept the
beamstrahlung photons. The 5 MW dump (a larger dump will be required for the
high energy IR) does double duty as a collimator of the disrupted beam energy tail,
see Section II-B. Some design requirements of the transport beam line to the test
beam/ﬁxed target experimental area are: 1) able to transport the full primary beam

rupted energy, 3) no energy dispersion in the experimental area, 4) magnet apertures
sized to allow useful secondary yields, 5) zero net bend so that the longitudinal po-
larization is preserved no matter what beam energy is being used in NLC, 6) the
experimental area has a suﬃcient transverse displacement from the straight-ahead
NLC dump line so that the muon ﬂux from the 5 MW dump is not a problem.

II TEST PARTICLE PRODUCTION AND TAIL

COLLIMATION

A Test Particle Production

Figure 3 shows simulations [10] of pion and proton yields at production angles
of 0.25◦, 0.5◦ and 1.0◦ for a 250 GeV electron beam of intensity 1012/pulse train on
a 0.3 rl Be target in a secondary beam line of acceptance 4 µsr and ∆P/P = 4%.
The curves show that the yield at 1◦ is large enough for lower energies, but that
the maximum energy of particles is a function of angle, so smaller angles give more
latitude in choosing the right yield at higher secondary energies. Kaon yields are
somewhere in between. Not enough test particles were used in these simulations to
determine if enough yield is produced at an angle of 1◦; this will be investigated at a
later time.

all angles shown; simulations with more test particles will be performed in the future to explore the
high energy region at larger angles with greater precision.

B Fixed Target Experiments

Figure 4 shows the concept of a combined test beam and ﬁxed target facility.
The beams after the dump are bent and sent through a system of slits. These slits
will be designed to deﬁne the momenta of the particles for the test beam application
and to clean up the remainder of the tails of the disrupted beams for ﬁxed target
experiments.

SLAC A-line are designed for such power. In the NLC case, not all power has to be
absorbed by the energy deﬁning slits because some will be absorbed by the 5 MW
dump.

At higher cms energy (1 TeV), the beams at collision are smaller, and the beam-
strahlung and coherent pair production eﬀects more severe. The use of disrupted
beams at higher energy also seems possible, but needs more study.

The disrupted beam depolarization due to the beam-beam interaction at the IP

depolarization for 250 GeV beams would be 0.3%.

III REQUIREMENTS ON THE FIXED TARGET

BEAMS AND POSSIBLE EXPERIMENTS

A Requirements on the Beam Parameters

The demands on beams for ﬁxed target physics are very modest compared to the
demands of luminosity production with colliding beams. For colliding beams both
beams must have a very small emittance, and both the electron and positron system
must be working at the highest level.

These requirements do not apply for ﬁxed target experiments. Here the lumi-
nosity is determined by the number of beam particles and the density of the target,
1039 cm−2 sec−1 can be
and not the emittance of the beams. Luminosities of
achieved; this is 4-5 orders of magnitude larger than in colliding beam experiments.
Furthermore, only the system for producing polarized electrons is needed.

≈

Traditionally, in preparing collider experiments a “Snowmass year” = 107 sec,
corresponding to 32% eﬃciency, is used for run time calculations. Because of the
relaxed conditions we will use √2*32% = 45% eﬃciency for ﬁxed target experiments
at the NLC. This number compares well with the experience at SLAC.

Requirements of ﬁxed target electron beams: These requirements are similar to present day spin
physics experimental needs, properties already achieved in End Station A at SLAC. The
two last quantities (*) are the uncertainties with respect to the polarization state integrated
over an entire run.

As shown above, the speciﬁc requirements of energy spread and polarization for
ﬁxed target experiments can be achieved, even with disrupted beams. This opens
up parasitic use of otherwise unused beams, thus enhancing the physics value of
operations at moderate cost.

B Fixed Target Area Design Parameters

The ﬁxed target area, including the targets, must be accessible during colliding
beam operations to make installation and operation of the ﬁxed target experiments
eﬃcient and independent from the colliding beam operation. The main colliding beam
200 m is assumed to be hermetic, except for µ’s. Muons range out with
dump at

∝

0.4 m per GeV in earth and a transverse spread of about 10 m. At 250 GeV they will
600 m in the earth beyond the main colliding beam dump, so the transverse
reach
separation of the experimental area from the primary line-of-ﬂight of the µ’s has to
be at least 10 m.

∝

≈

This optimal scattering angles at 250 GeV are 1-4 mrad for Møller experiments
and
20 mrad for spin structure experiments. This in turn requires large drift
sections to have enough transverse space available for the spectrometers. The target
and spectrometer locations can be separated by a divergent tunnel to minimize the
excavation costs of an experimental hall.

C Possible Experiments

Below is a list of possible experiments which should continue to be interesting
ten years from now, thereby opening a window of opportunity for NLC. The avail-
ability of high energy, high ﬂux and high polarization γ-beams will spawn new and
exciting proposals because the ﬁgure of merit of γ-absorption experiments increases
with energy.

With a backscattered laser beam, quasi-monochromatic γ’s of 200 GeV energy can
also be produced, but at much lower intensities.

As listed above, with γ-absorption, the gluon spin contribution ∆G in the nucleon
can be determined. This is an interesting possibility via open charm production from
γg fusion, because the cross section for γN -> c¯cX at 200 GeV is 700 nb, so that the
event rate with a primary γ-beam will be very high. An experiment using muons,
but similar in kinematics with a much lower event rate, is COMPASS at CERN
[14]. A new proposal to do such measurements at SLAC with a 45 GeV coherent
bremsstrahlung beam (SLAC-Proposal E-161, [13]) has just been approved.

Another experiment which could have a very large impact on the physics of charm
mixing, is γN -> c¯cX. Here the cross section is 3 orders of magnitude larger than at
B-factories. The kinematic boost is large compared even to asymmetric B-factories,
opening up a new regime for lifetime determinations, D0-mixing and CP-violation.
This experiment would improve on the work of the FOCUS collaboration (FermiLab
E831, [15]) which used a 250 GeV endpoint broad band bremsstrahlung beam from
secondary electrons and positrons produced from the 800 GeV Tevatron proton beam.

D Speciﬁc Example: The Running of sin2ΘW by Polarized

Møller Scattering

SLAC is currently ﬁnishing construction of a 50 GeV ﬁxed target experiment to
measure the weak mixing angle [16] at low momentum transfer (oﬀ the Z) with Møller
scattering with great precision (E-158, [17]). The ﬁrst runs are scheduled for early
2001.

Figure 7 shows a theoretical prediction and several experimental measurements of
sin2ΘW as well as the predicted errors for two potential NLC ﬁxed target experiments.
Like other Weinberg angle measurements [20], they are based on measuring ALR, the
left-right asymmetry.

TABLE: Impact of beam energy on the Møller measurement error: as explained in the text the
statistical error decreases with increasing beam energy. 100% polarization was assumed for the
table.

The small errors result mainly from the fact that the left-right asymmetry is
proportional to the beam energy: ALR
E. This has a unique and beneﬁcial con-
∝
sequence for Møller scattering. Generally in electron scattering the cross section is
8

E−2, but in the case of
proportional to the inverse of the beam energy squared, σ
E−1 (see Ref. [17]). The ﬁgure of merit for
Møller scattering the cross section is
∝
this experiment, however, is A2
E. The consequence is that the statistical error
decreases with increasing beam energy. The point in Figure 7 at NLC-250 assumes a
total charge of 170 Coul on target. Assuming the nominal NLC beam of 1012 electrons
per bunch train, this corresponds to eight months running at 45% eﬃciency using an
undisrupted beam. For the disrupted beam, 57% of the beam is within ∆E/E = 1%.
In this case 120 Coul can be collected in nine months running, or 170 Coul in 13
months.

·

In summary for Møller scattering, the use of disrupted beams is possible and
the beam depolarization due to colliding beams is small. Within about one year of
running at NLC energies, the compositeness of the electron can be probed at the 60
TeV scale and the existence of an extra Z-boson, Z′, can be veriﬁed or excluded up to
2.7 GeV. An important cross check on the Higgs mass can be performed at the 10%
level [21].

IV SUMMARY

Single beam use at the NLC oﬀers possibilities for a wide variety of ﬁxed target
experiments at (relatively) modest cost. We have investigated the possibilities of
attaching a single beam facility to the low energy IR at 250 GeV maximum energy
for polarized electrons, 200 GeV for polarized quasi-monochromatic photons. Other
locations are possible. NLC detector development and testing, in particular for a
detector in the HE IR, is possible with the early availability of a 250 GeV test beam.

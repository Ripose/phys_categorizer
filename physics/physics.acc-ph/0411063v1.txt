Abstract

Various projects under study require an angular-momentum-dominated electron beam generated

by a photoinjector. Some of the proposals directly use the angular-momentum-dominated beams

(e.g. electron cooling of heavy ions), while others require the beam to be transformed into a ﬂat

beam (e.g. possible electron injectors for light sources and linear colliders).

In this paper, we

report our experimental study of an angular-momentum-dominated beam produced in a photoin-

jector, addressing the dependencies of angular momentum on initial conditions. We also brieﬂy

discuss the removal of angular momentum. The results of the experiment, carried out at the Fer-

milab/NICADD Photoinjector Laboratory, are found to be in good agreement with theoretical and

numerical models.

INTRODUCTION

Angular-momentum-dominated electron beams generated by photoinjectors have direct

applications in several accelerator proposals presently under consideration, either in the

ﬁeld of high-energy colliders or accelerator-based light sources. In Reference [1], an angular-

momentum-dominated, or “magnetized”, beam is proposed to be accelerated to ∼ 50 MeV

and used for electron beam cooling [2, 3] of ion beams in the relativistic heavy ion collider

(RHIC). In such a scheme, the electron beam propagates together with the ion beam at the

same velocity. Collisions of ions with electrons lead to a transfer of thermal motion from the

ion to the electron beam. As the two beams co-propagate, the electron-ion eﬀective inter-

action length is increased due to the helical trajectory of the electron in the magnetic ﬁeld,

thereby improving the cooling eﬃciency. The cooling rate is then mainly determined by

the longitudinal momentum spread of the electron beam, which can be made much smaller

than the transverse one. Reference [4] concerns the photoinjector production of ﬂat beams,

i.e. a beam with high transverse emittance ratio. The technique consists of manipulating

an angular-momentum-dominated beam produced by a photoinjector using the linear trans-

formation described in Reference [5]. The latter linear transformation removes the angular

momentum and results in a ﬂat beam. In the context of linear collider proposals, where a

ﬂat beam at the interaction point is needed to reduce beamstrahlung [6], the development

of a ﬂat-beam electron source is an attractive idea since it could simplify or eliminate the

need for an electron damping ring. The ﬂat beam technique is also proposed for generation

of ultrashort X-ray pulses by making use of the smaller dimension of the ﬂat beam [7], and

also in enhancing beam-surface interaction in a Smith-Purcell radiator [8] or in an image

charge undulator [9]. A proof-of-principle experiment conducted at the Fermilab/NICADD

Photoinjector Laboratory (FNPL)[29] has demonstrated the ﬂat beam production [10, 11],

where an emittance ratio of 50 was reported.

In this paper we report on recent results pertaining to the experimental investigation

of some properties of an angular-momentum-dominated beam. We also brieﬂy address the

removal of angular momentum and the subsequent generation of a ﬂat beam. Producing ﬂat

beams is our primary motivation for the present studies.

In Section II we brieﬂy summarize theoretical aspects of the photoinjector production of

angular-momentum-dominated beams. In Section III we describe the experimental set-up

2

of FNPL. Sections IV and V are dedicated to experimental results and their comparisons to

theory and numerical simulations. Our conclusions appear in Section VI.

II. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

In this section we assume the beam and external focusing forces to be cylindrically

symmetric. The cylindrical symmetry implies the conservation of the canonical angular

momentum of each electron. In an axial magneto static ﬁeld Bz(z), the canonical angular

momentum of an electron, L, in circular cylindrical coordinates (r, φ, z) is [12]

L = γmr2 ˙φ +

eBz(z)r2,

1
2

where γ is the Lorentz factor,

˙φ the time derivative of φ, m and e are respectively the

electron rest mass and charge.

The average canonical angular momentum of the electrons, hLi, is obtained by averaging

Eq. (1) over the beam distribution. At the photocathode location, we have h ˙φi = 0 and

hLi =

eB0hr2i = eB0σ2
c ,

1
2

where σc = phr2i/2 is the transverse root-mean-square (rms) beam size on the photocath-

ode, B0 = Bz(z = 0) is the axial magnetic ﬁeld on the photocathode.

Outside the solenoidal ﬁeld region, where Bz vanishes, an electron acquires mechanical

angular momentum due to the torque exerted on it in the transition region. Since Bz(z) = 0,

the second term of Eq. (1) vanishes and the canonical angular momentum is given by the ﬁrst

term of Eq. (1), which is the mechanical angular momentum. It is convenient to normalize

hLi with the axial momentum pz, and introduce the quantity L given by

where κ = eB0/(2pz).

The beam angular momentum can be removed by means of a properly designed skew

quadrupole section [13, 14, 15] and the beam is transformed into a ﬂat beam (see section V).

The ﬂat beam transverse emittances after the skew quadrupole section, ǫ±, are given by [15,

16]:

Here ǫu is the uncorrelated transverse emittance prior to the skew quadrupole section. Note
that the four dimensional emittance is conserved since ǫ2

u = ǫ+ǫ−.

I0γ3 is the generalized perveance, I is the absolute
value of the instantaneous beam current and I0 is the Alfv´en current for electrons (∼ 17

kA). The second, third and fourth terms respectively represent the eﬀects due to space

charge, emittance and the angular momentum. For low energy beam, the space charge term

is important. However, for the typical operating conditions considered in this paper, e.g.,

γ ≈ 30, bunch charge ≈ 0.5 nC, rms beam duration σt ≈ 4 ps, σ ≈ 1.25 mm [18], γǫu ≈ 4

mm mrad [19], γL ≈ 20 mm mrad, the fourth term Eq. 5 is much greater than the second

and the third term. Such a beam is said to be angular momentum dominated.

The thereby photoemitted electron bunch exits from the rf-gun at 4 MeV/c and is immedi-

ately injected into a TESLA-type superconducting cavity [20] (henceforth referred to as the

booster cavity). The bunch momentum downstream of the booster cavity is approximately

16 MeV/c when the cavity is operated to yield the maximum energy gain. The typical

operating conditions of the main subsystems of the photoinjector are gathered in Table I,

and a block diagram of the facility is depicted in Fig. 1.

IV. MEASUREMENTS OF CANONICAL ANGULAR MOMENTUM

We now turn to the basic properties of the canonical angular momentum. We especially

investigate the conversion of the canonical angular momentum of the photo-emitted electron

bunch into mechanical angular momentum downstream of the booster cavity.

FIG. 2: Beam with angular-momentum-induced shearing while drifting. The dark narrow rectangle

represents a slit inserted into the beamline to measure the shearing angle (see text for more details).

The canonical angular momentum at the photocathode surface is obtained from Eq. (2).

Given the experimental settings of the solenoidal lens currents, the magnetic ﬁeld, B0, is
inferred via simulations using the Poisson [24] program, which is bench-marked against

calibration of the solenoidal lenses [25]. The value of σc used in Eq. (2) is directly measured

from an image of the UV laser on a “virtual photocathode”. The virtual photocathode is a

calibrated UV-sensitive screen, located outside of the vacuum chamber, being a one-to-one

optical image of the photocathode.

To elaborate the method used to measure the mechanical angular momentum downstream

of the booster cavity, we consider an electron in a magnetic-ﬁeld-free region at longitudinal
location z1 with transverse radial vector r1 = r1 ˆex ( ˆex stands for the x-axis unit vector).
After propagating through a drift space, the electron reaches r2 at location z2. Let θ =
∠(r1, r2) be the angle between the two aforementioned radial vectors (θ is henceforth referred
to as “shearing angle”; see Fig. 2). The mechanical angular momentum of the electron, L,

is given by:

L = r1 ˆex × P = r1py ˆex × ˆey.

Thus the measurements of rms beam sizes at locations z1 and z2 along with the corresponding

shearing angle provide all the necessary information for calculating the mechanical angular

momentum. Experimentally, the shearing angle is obtained by inserting at location z1

a multislit mask and measuring the corresponding shearing angle of the beamlets at the

location z2; see Fig. 3. For the mechanical angular momentum measurement reported here

we use the diagnostic stations X3 and X6 (see Fig. 1). The X3 diagnostic station includes

an OTR screen and two insertable multislit masks (with vertical and horizontal slits). The

station X6 is only equipped with an OTR screen.

A set of measurements of mechanical angular momentum versus B0 was reported in

Ref. [26]. In the present Paper, such measurements are performed by varying B0 over a wider

range (B0 ∈ [200, 1000] Gauss for a bunch charge of 0.41 ± 0.05nC; see details in Ref. [18]).

The measurement technique discussed in the previous paragraph was also numerically tested

for each experimental data point. In Fig. 4 we compare the measured mechanical angular

momentum from Eq. (8) with the canonical angular momentum calculated from Eq. (2),

given the B0. The measured values include both experimental data and simulated values,

value of the canonical angular momentum calculated from the axial magnetic ﬁeld (solid line). In

the top ﬁgure, the dashed line represents the average value of all the data points, and the shaded

area has the same meaning as in Fig. 5.

i.e., values that have been retrieved after simulating the measurement technique numerically
with the particle tracking program Astra [27]. The uncertainties in the measurement of

angular momentum are obtained via error propagation from the direct measurements of rms

beam sizes and the “shearing angle”.

Conservation of canonical angular momentum is demonstrated in Fig. 5, where the an-

gular momentum was measured at diﬀerent locations along the beamline. In these measure-

ments all quadrupoles are turned oﬀ so that the beam propagated in a drift space.

The dependence of mechanical angular momentum on the charge was also explored. In

this experiment, the laser spot size was set to σc = 0.82 mm, and the laser intensity was

varied via a wave-plate attenuator located in the UV laser path. The results, shown in

Fig. 6(a), indicate the mechanical angular momentum, for our set of operating parame-

ters, is charge-independent, conﬁrming our assumption that the beam dynamics is angular-

momentum-dominated in the range explored here.

Finally the dependence of canonical angular momentum versus σc was investigated. The

laser intensity was held constant and B0 was identical to the previous experiment (B0 =

962 G). The charge density in the bunch is therefore kept constant. The measurements

[see Fig. 6(b)] support the expected quadratic dependence of the angular momentum on σc

The measured dependencies of canonical angular momentum on the diﬀerent parameters

are all in good agreement with theoretical expectations. Such an agreement gives us some

conﬁdence on our ability to control the angular momentum of the incoming beam upstream

of the RTFB section.

V. REMOVAL OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM AND FLAT-BEAM GENERATION

To remove angular momentum,

it is necessary to apply a torque on the beam. A

quadrupole can exert a net torque only on an incoming asymmetric beam. Thus more than

one quadrupole is needed to remove the angular momentum of an cylindrically symmetric

incoming beam. A ﬁrst quadrupole followed by a drift space will introduce asymmetry in the

x-y space, while the other quadrupoles downstream are properly tuned to apply a total net

torque such that the angular momentum is removed at the exit of the quadrupole section.

For the series of measurements and simulations presented in this section, a set of three skew

quadrupoles (S2, S3, S5 in Fig. 1) are used to remove the angular momentum and generate

a ﬂat beam.

Given the photoinjector parameters, numerical simulations of the beamline (from the
photocathode up to the entrance of the RTFB transformer) are performed using Astra. The

four-dimensional phase-space coordinates are propagated downstream of the transformer

using a linear transfer matrix. The initial values of the skew quadrupole strengths are those

derived, under the thin-lens approximation, in Reference [28]. They are then optimized,

using a least-square technique, to minimize the x-y coupling terms of the beam matrix at

the exit of the transformer. The ﬁnal optimized quadrupole strengths are used for subsequent
Astra simulation of the beam dynamics through the RTFB transformer.

Further empirical optimization around the predicted values is generally needed to insure

the angular momentum is totally removed, as inferred by observation of the x-y coupling at

several locations downstream of the RTFB section. Evolution of transverse density through-

out the RTFB section is in good agreement with expectations from simulations, as shown in

Fig. 7. Each of the top six photos is a superposition of 5 bunches with charge of 0.55 ± 0.10

nC. In the sequence of measurements and simulations presented there, the incoming round

beam (X3) is transformed into a ﬂat beam characterized by the large asymmetry (X7 and

beam propagates from X7 to X8.

VI. CONCLUSION

We have experimentally explored some parametric dependencies of angular momentum

for an angular-momentum-dominated electron beam produced in a photoinjector. The re-

sults obtained are in good agreement with theoretical expectations, giving us some conﬁdence

in our understanding of the angular-momentum-dominated beam.

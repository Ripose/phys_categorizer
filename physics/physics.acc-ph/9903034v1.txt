THE TOUSCHEK EFFECT
IN STRONG FOCUSING STORAGE RINGS

A. Piwinski

Abstract

The lifetime of a stored beam due to the Touschek eﬀect is calculated
for arbitrary ratios of beam height to beam width. A variation of
the beam envelopes is taken into account, i. e. the derivatives of
the horizontal and vertical amplitude functions and dispersions are
included. The calculation is done for arbitrary energies in the rest
frame of the colliding particles.

Introduction

Coulomb scattering of charged particles in a stored beam causes an exchange
of energies between the transverse and longitudinal motion. It changes, therefore,
the betatron and synchrotron oscillation coordinates of the colliding particles. One
consequence is the Touschek eﬀect which is the transformation of a small transverse
momentum into a large longitudinal momentum due to the scattering. Then both
scattered particles are lost, one with too much and one with too little energy. The
ampliﬁcation of the momentum change is a relativistic eﬀect so that the change of
the longitudinal momentum is increased by the Lorentz factor γ.

The Touschek eﬀect is diﬀerent from intra-beam scattering which is also caused
by Coulomb scattering. The intra-beam scattering, however, is a multiple scattering
which leads to diﬀusion in all three directions and, primarily, changes the beam
dimensions. The Touschek eﬀect, on the other hand, is a single scattering eﬀect
which leads to the immediate loss of the colliding particles. Here only the energy
transfer from the transverse to the longitudinal direction plays a role

The Touschek eﬀect was observed for the ﬁrst time in the small electron storage
ring ADA [1] and it turned out later that it is a serious problem in storage rings
at low energies and in synchrotron light sources where it can reduce the lifetime
considerably. Theoretical investigations were made in [1, 2] for the non-relativistic
case, where the velocities of two colliding particles are non-relativistic in their center of
mass system. The theory was then extended in [3] to the ultra-relativistic case, and in
[4] to arbitrary energies. Dispersion was included in [5]. In all these calculations only
the transfer of horizontal momentum into longitudinal momentum was considered
whereas the transfer of the vertical momentum was neglected. In [6] a 100% coupling
of horizontal and vertical betatron oscillations, i. e. the special case of a round beam,
was considered for the non-relativistic case.

The main aim of the following calculation is to take into account both the hori-
zontal and the vertical betatron oscillations. In that case one has a two-dimensional
distribution of the transverse momenta which leads to a weaker dependence on the
maximum stable energy deviation than a one-dimensional distribution. This can
increase the Touschek lifetime by a factor of two as compared to the ﬂat beam ap-
proximation at energies around 1 GeV, but the correction can be larger at lower
energies.

At the same time a variation of the beam envelopes is taken into account. The
derivatives of the amplitude functions βx and βz and of the dispersions Dx and Dz
increase the angle between colliding particles. But the derivatives of the amplitude
functions play a role only at positions where the dispersion does not vanish, or to
be exact, where βx,zD′
β′
x,zDx,z/2 is diﬀerent from zero. In that case they can
increase the loss rate and decrease the Touschek lifetime.

x,z −

We will use here the same method as for the calculation of the intra-beam scat-
tering [7]. Thus we will consider the collision of two arbitrary particles in their center
of mass system using the complete Møller scattering cross section, i. e. assuming ar-
bitrary energies in the center of mass system. After transforming into the laboratory

2

system we will calculate the number of collisions with those momentum changes which
lead to the loss of both particles. When averaging over the positions and angles of
the colliding particles we will assume Gaussian distributions for all coordinates.

2. Change of the momenta of two colliding particles

The momenta ~p1 and ~p2 of the two colliding particles before the collision are given

in the laboratory coordinate system

s, x, z

by the two vectors

~p1,2 = 






j,k,l

~p1~p2 = p1p2 cos(χ1+χ2)

p1 sin χ1 = p2 sin χ2

where s indicates the longitudinal, x the horizontal, and z the vertical direction. We
deﬁne a coordinate system with the axes j, k, and l which are parallel to ~p1 + ~p2,
~p2), respectively. The two momenta then take the form
~p1 ×

~p2, and (~p1 + ~p2)

(~p1 ×

×

where χ1 and χ2 are the angles between the vector ~p1 + ~p2 and the vectors ~p1 and ~p2,
respectively. They are given by the two relations

and

When we apply a Lorentz transformation parallel to ~p1 + ~p2 we obtain for the

momenta ~¯p1 and ~¯p2 in the c. o. m. system the representation

~¯p1,2 = p1,2 

The transformed energies ¯E1 and ¯E2 are given by (see App. A1)

¯E1,2 = γtE1,2(1

βtβ1,2 cos χ1,2) = (E1+E2)/(2γt)

−

where βt is the relative velocity of the c. o. m. system, γt is the Lorentz factor of the
transformation, β1,2 are the relative velocities of the two particles in the laboratory
system, and the bars denote all quantities in the c. o. m. system. βt is determined by
the condition that the sum of the two momenta vanishes in the c. o. m. system and
is given by:

βt =

p1χ1 = p2χ2

Finally one obtains with χ1 ≈

χ2 ≈
4χ2 = (px1 −

the two angles ¯ψ and ¯φ, where ¯ψ is the angle between the momentum of the scattered

particle ~¯p

We want to calculate the number of collisions per unit time which lead to the loss
of both particles. We shall integrate, therefore, the cross section with respect to all
positions and angles of the two colliding particles satisfying the condition Eq.(21).
The distribution of the positions and angles of electrons and positrons is, in good
approximation, a Gaussian distribution:

The number of particles lost per unit time is given by

The fact that always two particles are lost is taken into account by averaging over
both particles, 1 and 2, in Eqs.(28) to (30), so that there are always two contributions
to the scattering rate which diﬀer only by the indices 1 and 2. Integration of Eq.(38)

that the change γtσzβ/βz of the longitudinal momentum due to the initial vertical
momentum σzβ/βz is smaller than the maximum stable momentum deviation δm so
that the vertical momentum does not contribute to the loss rate. The Bessel function

(53)

where Ko is a Bessel function, the integral in Eq.(52) can be solved exactly except
for the terms with ln(τ /(1 + τ )). Then one gets for small τm:

F (τm, B1, 0) = √πB1(2 + B1)(K1 −

Ko)eB1/2 + 0(√τm)

(54)

11

where K1 and Ko are Bessel functions with the argument B1/2.

Thus for a round beam F becomes constant with decreasing τm. This is diﬀerent in
the case of a ﬂat beam where F increases continuously with decreasing τm. The reason
for the diﬀerent behaviour is the diﬀerent distribution of the transverse momentum.
dδm more particles
When the maximum stable energy deviation δm is decreased by
will be lost having the smaller transverse momentum diﬀerence ∆p⊥
d∆p⊥. In a one-
dimensional distribution the number of particles which can be scattered additionally
is proportional to 2d∆px, but in a two-dimensional distribution it is proportional to
2π∆p⊥d∆p⊥ with ∆2p⊥ = ∆2px + ∆2pz. Thus with decreasing ∆p⊥ the increase in
loss rate is larger in a one-dimensional distribution, i. e. in a ﬂat beam.

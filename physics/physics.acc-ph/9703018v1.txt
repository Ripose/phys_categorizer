Wire scanners in low energy accelerators

Fast wire scanners are today considered as part of standard instrumen-
tation in high energy synchrotrons. The extension of their use to syn-
chrotrons working at lower energies, where Coulomb scattering can be
important and the transverse beam size is large, introduces new complica-
tions considering beam heating of the wire, composition of the secondary
particle shower and geometrical consideration in the detection set-up. A
major problem in treating these eﬀects is that the creation of secondaries
in a thin carbon wire by a energetic primary beam is diﬃcult to describe
in an analytical way. We are here presenting new results from a full Monte
Carlo simulation of this process yielding information on heat deposited in
the wire, particle type and energy spectrum of secondaries and angular
dependence as a function of primary beam energy. The results are used
to derive limits for the use of wire scanners in low energy accelerators.

1 Introduction

Fast wire scanners have been used successfully for beam proﬁle measurements
in the CERN-PS [1–5] for more than ten years. We are presently considering
to extend the use of them to the PS injector, the PS Booster. The PSB is a
1013 protons
synchrotron with four superimposed rings accelerating up to 1
per ring from 50 MeV to 1 GeV kinetic beam energy. Operation of the fast
wire scanners in this low energy region where the physical beam emittance
is large has triggered us to take a new look at the theory for wire heating,
emittance blow up and the importance of the geometrical relationships in the
detector set-up. The work has been specially aimed at the low energy domain
of a proton beam but the results are in general valid also for the high energy
domain.

×

The design and operation of fast wire scanners has been described elsewhere
[1–8]. We will here only concern ourselves with the problems that set the limits
for the use of these devices. For our discussion we need to deﬁne a geometry
and as a starting point we use the geometry shown in Fig. 1. The ﬁgure is
showing an instant in the process of the wire sweeping through the beam. The
transverse particle distribution within the beam is for simplicity taken to be
σ of
Gaussian. As a measure for the beam size we have in this work used 4
the Gaussian beam proﬁle as the measure for the beam width. This transforms
to the so called 2σ emittance which at the CERN-PS is the standard quoted
measure for transverse beam emittance.

2 Simulation of beam-wire interaction

The fast wire scanner method for measuring beam proﬁles is based on the
simple fact that an energetic particle beam passing any obstacle , in our case a
thin carbon wire, will create a secondary particle shower which is proportional
to the primary beam intensity. The limits for the method is determined by
how much deposited heat the carbon wire can support and the possibility of
detecting the secondary particles. With this in mind we have simulated the
process of a primary proton beam passing a thin carbon wire using the FLUKA
code, [9]. The main interaction parameters studied are the heat deposited in
the carbon wire, the angular dependence of the particle shower as a function of
energy and the particle composition and energy spectrum of the secondaries.

2.1 Heat deposited in the carbon wire

The simulation was especially aimed at calculating the part of the interaction
energy deposited in the wire (which eventually is transferred to heat). The
fraction of the total deposited energy leaving through the nuclear interaction
proved to be very small, e.g. at 100 MeV kinetic beam energy 35.5 keV is
deposited in wire as heat and only 0.67 keV is leaving the wire through the
nuclear interaction. The nuclear interaction part of the energy remains more
or less constant up to the highest simulated value at 1 GeV. Furthermore,
we also calculated the possible spread of the deposited energy along the wire
due to internal scattering and even at the ﬁnest spatial resolution used in our
simulations of 0.001 mm no signiﬁcant smearing of the deposited energy was
observed.

As a model for the energy loss we take the Bethe–Bloch formula (see e.g.[12])

2.2 Secondary particle shower

The inelastic cross section of a 100 MeV proton in carbon is of the order of
240 mb, rising to about 250 mb at 1 GeV. The elastic cross section drops from
about 180 mb at 100 MeV to roughly 100 mb at 1 GeV.

For the typical total scattering cross section of 400 mb and a carbon density
of 2.3g/cm3 the mean free path in the wire material is 21.7 cm. For a wire
with a radius of 15 µm the average number of protons needed to obtain one
scattering is 9200. Since the interaction probability is so small, scattering of
the produced secondaries can be neglected.

Using the scattered particles the beam intensity can be monitored, by mea-
suring the energy deposition in a detector well away from the beam axis. This
requires that the energy deposited per one scattered particle is known. This
can be calculated with the FLUKA Monte Carlo program [9].

The simulations should be carried out in a realistic geometry, since stray
radiation around an accelerator may give a signiﬁcant contribution to the total
energy deposition. The simulations presented in the following were carried out
in a very idealized geometry.

The detectors were represented by polyethylene disks of 5 mm thickness, 3 cm
diameter and a density of 0.95 g/cm3. These were placed at a radial distance

5

of 50 cm from the point where the beam hits the wire. 17 detectors, starting
at a polar angle of 10 degrees and spaced by 10 degrees were used.

The scattering of protons with 100 MeV and 1 GeV kinetic energy was studied.
Instead of simulating a beam hitting the wire, we ﬁrst created sets of 10000
elastic and 10000 inelastic events for both energies. The secondaries from
these events were then mixed in ratios given by the inelastic and elastic cross
sections. Since these event sets were postulated to be representative of an
inﬁnite number of events, the event structure itself was not important. So the
azimuth angle of each secondary particle could be separately sampled between
zero and 2π. Due to the small solid angle covered by the detectors the relatively
limited number of events could be reused several times to improve the statistics
of the quantities scored at the detectors.

The obtained energy deposition is shown in Fig. 3. Normalization is to one
proton incident on the wire assuming a circular wire with 30 µm diameter. In
the upper plots the total energy deposition and the fraction coming from elas-
tic scattering is shown separately. It can be seen that the elastic contribution
quickly becomes negligible, which is fortunate, since the angular distributions
of the elastic scattering in Fluka are not really optimized to reproduce single
scattering distributions. In particular they lack the diﬀractive structure, which
is characteristic for elastic scattering and only reproduce rough trends of the
diﬀerential cross section.

The lower plots show a comparison of the energy deposition in the detectors if
material is introduced between the wire and the detectors. In a real situation
there will always be at least a thin window, sometimes a thick beam pipe.
Therefore we compare four cases, our idealized one without any material and
with three steel window thicknesses of 0.1, 1 and 10 mm. This “window” was
in the simulations a spherical iron (density 7.87 g/cm3) shell of 40 cm radius,
surrounding the point where the particles originated from. It can be seen
that the thicker windows start to reduce the energy deposition only at large
angles. At the forward angles the presence of material can even increase the
energy deposition due to secondary interactions. As expected the material has
more eﬀect for the lower beam energy. Qualitatively the behaviour can be
understood by looking at the particle spectra. These are shown in Fig. 4 for
5) degrees. It can be seen that
scattering angles of 10 (
at 90 degrees the particle spectra are considerably softer than in the forward
direction, which accounts for the larger eﬀect of material. Of course also the
spectra for the lower beam energy are softer than those from the higher one.
A minimum ionizing particle would loose about 12 MeV/cm in iron, which
already would cut into the spectrum. In fact all of the particles are on the
1/β2 part of the Bethe–Bloch equation, and therefore lose much more than 12
MeV/cm. And with decreasing energy this energy loss increases rapidly. So a
10 mm iron layer stops a signiﬁcant fraction of the particles.

respect to the beam direction. Normalisation is to one particle incident on the 30 µm

(i) At the low energies considered here evaporation fragments and splitting of
the 12C nucleus into three helium nuclei are important inelastic channels.
The heavy fragments have not been transported. This underestimates the
result and probably their eﬀect would be to make the angular distribution
ﬂatter, since elastic scattering and particle production are less isotropic
than evaporation and fragmentation. However, the heavy fragments are
very slow and therefore highly ionising, so they most probably would
be stopped in almost any kind of window separating the wire from the
detectors.

(ii) As was pointed out previously the simulations should be done in a realistic
geometry with realistic beam halo. Neither surrounding walls, nor support
materials, nor the arriving beam have been included in the simulations.
Their eﬀect would be to generate stray radiation, mostly photons and
neutrons all over the system. Especially plastic scintillators would be
sensitive to this stray radiation ﬁeld.

3 Beam heating of the wire

3.1 A simple model of heating

In the process of is interaction with the beam the wire the wire gets heated
by energy absorption. We shall formulate a model to estimate the maximal
temperature rise in the stationary situation when the wire sweeps back and
forth with a given frequency. The formalism is generally valid for any particle
type and any energy range. The numerical examples are given for a low energy
proton beam. For a general discussion on heating in any obstacle by a primary
beam we refer to [10], for a detailed discussion of the heating in a carbon wire
by protons to [14] and for high energy electrons to [11]. We compile the main
results here for convenience. Let us initially neglect conductive cooling and
only consider radiative cooling, in the end of this section we will derive the

8

condition for this approximation.

When the wire is in the beam it is thus heated according to the equation

and the maximal temperature it can reach is

.

For constant normalised emittance it is useful re-express everything in terms of
β. Furthermore, we must also account for the fact that the highest temperature
is reached in the part of the wire that sweeps through the centre of the assumed
Gaussian beam proﬁle. So all together we can write the maximum temperature
as,

at β <

of the beam. If the wire is swept with a constant speed and frequency the
time the wire spends in the beam decreases with increasing E since the beam
size decreases, thus seemingly reducing the ﬁnal temperature. In order to ﬁnd
out what really happens in that case we need to solve the dynamical heating
problem.

3.2 Solution to the periodic heating

We shall now ﬁnd the stationary temperature in the case the wire is swept
through the beam with a given speed and frequency. The wire is cooled by
radiation from a temperature T0 to T1 during the cooling time tc, and then
heated to T2 during the heating time th. Putting T0 = T2 we shall ﬁnd the max-
imal temperature in the stationary situation. During cooling the temperature

but, as we shall see, the cooling time has to be very short for this approxima-
tion to be valid.

3.2.3 Conductivity

So far we have neglected conductivity in the wire and we shall now estimate
its importance compared to radiation. As a measure of the importance of
conductivity we shall compare the radiated energy from the heated region of
the wire with the conducted energy. The conducted energy per unit time is

3.3 Numerical example

In order to better see the validity of the approximations and the actual phys-
ical values they predict we shall go through a real example with a carbon
wire in a proton beam. It is important to remember that the nature of our
problem and the many approximations done in our derivation are such that
we can’t hope for high numerical precision results. The derived formulas can
only give us an idea of the temperatures reached and show the temperatures
energy dependence. The values we use in the Bethe–Bloch equation are given
in Tab. 1. Other numerical values are given in Tab. 2.

With the parameters in the tables the maximal temperature is given by

For long cooling time we can use the approximate formula in Eq. (16). It turns
out that the combination bthT 3
m is in fact small for a large range of energies
so the approximate temperature is T0 = bthT 4
m. We show this as a function
of energy as the lower solid line in Fig. 5. The condition for the long cooling
time to be valid is from Eq. (14) that

The right hand side of this equation is plotted as the solid line in Fig. 6.

For low energies the sweep frequency must be well below 0.01 Hertz for this
approximation to be valid. The approximation of short cooling time is valid if
the correction in Eq. (21) is small, which means

and this limit is also plotted in Fig. 6 (dashed line). Since there is a wide
range of cooling times for which none of the above approximations works we
should also solve the full Eq. (13) exactly. This solution is presented in Fig. 5
for tc = 0.001, 0.1 and 100 s.

Finally we need to check from Eq. (25) that the conductivity is negligible in
our example. At high energy T0 increases but at the same time ∆y decreases,
and the net eﬀect is that the ratio Pr/Pc decreases. For the region in E that
we have studied here we always have Pr/Pc > 10 which justiﬁes neglecting
conductivity.

4 Emittance blow-up of the primary beam

4.1 Emittance blow-up due to a thin window

The increase of the beam emittance when passing a thin window is a well
understood process (see e.g. [13]). The scattering of the beam increases the
angular spread of the beam which through ﬁlamentation results in an increased
emittance

E = E0 + ∆E = E0 +

(30)

π
2

βT h

θ2

.

i

Here E0 is the initial emittance and βT the Twiss value in the plane of the
emittance at the thin window. The average square scattering angle will depend
on the characteristics of the foil and the beam and is usually derived using
formulas based on the Moli`ere theory for multiple Coulomb scattering [15].
The emittance blow up due to the wire scanner device can be evaluated using
the same formalism as the wire can be pictured as a virtual foil which thickness
depends on the velocity and shape of the wire and the velocity of the beam.
For the case of a wire with a circular cross section in a synchrotron with a
revolution time of τ0 (at β = 1) the virtual foil thickness (vft) can be written
as

zvf t =

(2r)2πβ

Consequently, we are for e.g. the CERN-CPS wire scanners left in a situation
in between single Coulomb scattering and multiple scattering. We can get
an idea of the order of magnitude if we assume that we are dealing with
single Rutherford scattering events and that outside the atomic radius there
is no interaction between the primary particle and the scattering centre. If
for a numerical example we take the parameters in Tab. 2 at a kinetic proton
beam energy of 1 GeV this approach gives a root mean square scattering
10−11 radians while a multiple scattering approach
angle of typically a few 1
10−7 radians. The large range spanned by these

two extreme approaches might be of theoretical interest but of no practical
importance in a large physical beam emittance machine where both values
yield an emittance blow-up well below the required precision. An attempt
was done to measure the emittance blow-up in the CERN-CPS caused by
the passage of a scanner wire using a two sweep process on a 500 ms ﬂat-
top of the magnetic cycle. An initial sweep and measurement was followed
approximately 400 ms later by a back-sweep also with a measurement. The
diﬀerence in emittance between the ﬁrst and the second sweep was assumed to
mainly be due to the blow-up in the wire. Earlier experience at the CPS has
shown that this is a reasonable assumption. However, for a physical ǫh = 30π
mm mrad proton beam at a beam energy of 300 MeV and a wire velocity of
20 m/s the error of the measured “emittance blow-up” was 0.3π mm mrad
which is insuﬁcient to separate between the two discussed approximations for
the scattering process. Planned improvements, in line with ﬁndings presented
in this note, for the dedicated low energy wire scanners in the PSB booster
should make that possible.

5 Detection of secondary particles

In section 2 we have shown that a detectable amount of secondary particles are
created by the primary beam when passing the wire of the fast wire scanners.
A detector positioned at a given polar angle with respect to the beam direction
can be used to monitor the number of particles scattered by the wire. If the
angle is of the order of 10 degrees or larger, we know from section 2 that only
nuclear scattering events, both elastic and inelastic, contribute.

Fig. 7. The deduced emittance is deviating from the real beam emittance due to
geometrical eﬀects and the anisotropy of the induced particle shower. The eﬀect is
increasing with decreasing energy (larger transversal beam size). Both the combined
result for both eﬀects and the more signiﬁcant geometrical eﬀect are plotted for
10, 30 and 90 degree (only geometrical eﬀects at 90 degree as the anisotropy eﬀect
of Eq. (33) is zero at 90 degree).

5.1 Eﬀect on the deduced emittance

The detectors occupy a certain space-angle which together with other detector
speciﬁc parameters determines the detection eﬃciency. For a beam which is
large transversely such as the high intensity - low energy proton beam in the
CPS, the space angle will change noticeably as the wire is passing through the
beam.

The secondary particles will be emitted anisotropically with a majority of the
particles going in the forward direction. This anisotropy will have “skewing”
eﬀect on the measured beam proﬁle if the transverse beam size is large. For
a rough estimate of the eﬀect we will assume that the anisotropy is described
by

W (θ) = 1 + cos θ

(33)

A simple approach to calculate the size of the combined eﬀect is to divide the
beam into thin slices, calculate the detector eﬃciency and the resulting number

16

of detected particles for each slice and ﬁnally compare the initial emittance
with the deduced emittance. Using the wire scanner example from Tab. 2 we
have calculated the inﬂuence of the change in space angle and of the particle
shower anisotropy for two wire scanner set-ups. In the ﬁrst conﬁguration the
detector is positioned in the forward direction 15 cm from the wire at an angle
of 30 degree to the beam axes and in the second conﬁguration with an angle
of 10 degree to the beam axes. The conﬁguration with an angle of 30 degree to
the beam axes is in the PS-complex enforced by the space limitations at the
wire-scanner installations. In our numerical example the beam was initially
assumed to be Gaussian and σ for the measured beam proﬁle was calculated
as

and where Ch(xi) is the number of counts in channel xi.

In Fig. 7 we can see that the deviation form the real beam emittance is, as
expected, increasing with decreasing beam energy. That is to say increasing
with increasing transverse beam size. In Fig. 8 the measured beam proﬁle dur-
ing acceleration of the same beam at 100 MeV and 1.4 GeV are shown for a
detector positioned at 85 degree angle to the beam axes. The beam is transver-
sally larger at 100 MeV and the beam proﬁle is slightly deformed due to the
discussed geometrical eﬀects. The resulting error in the deduced normalised
emittance is small and will in most situations be insigniﬁcant. However, it is
interesting to note that for the Gaussian beam shape the deformation of the
beam proﬁle is such that the inﬂuence on the deduced emittance goes from
positive values for large angles to negative values for small angles.

5.2 Active sweep range of scanner

The large transverse size of the large emittance beam demand a long active
sweep range for the scanner to i) establish the zero baseline and ii) avoid
acquisition of “cut” proﬁles. At the CERN-CPS we have measured systematic
diﬀerences of up to 10% between diﬀerent wire scanners measuring the same
beam but at diﬀerent positions with diﬀerent centres of the closed orbit. The

Fig. 8. In the centre of the ﬁgure the measured proﬁles for two beams with the same
normalised emittance at two diﬀerent energies, 100 MeV and 1.4 GeV, are shown.
The wider proﬁle at 100 MeV is slightly deformed due to geometrical eﬀects. To
the left in the ﬁgure a proﬁle truncated at 2σ from the proﬁle centre is shown. The
wire scanner software will for this proﬁle deduce an emittance which is 20% smaller
than the true emittance.

numerical ”simulations” discussed in the previous section conﬁrms that such
large deviations from the original beam emittance easily can be caused by a
large oﬀset of the centre of the proﬁle. In Fig. 8 the measured beam proﬁle at
100 MeV for a beam proﬁle well centred in the wire-scanner sweep range and
for one truncated at 2σ form the beam proﬁle centre are shown. The presently
used wire scanner software will for this proﬁle deduce an emittance which is
20% smaller than the true beam emittance.

6 Discussion

We have presented new simulations for the creation of secondary particles
in a thin carbon wire by a primary proton beam. The derived limits for the
use of wire scanners show that the use of these devices in a low energy (50
MeV - 1 GeV) accelerators with large transverse beam size is fully feasible.
The total deposited energy in the wire increases with decreasing beam energy.
Nevertheless, the wire will not get hotter but rather the opposite due to the
increase of the total heated wire volume as the beam size is usually large at

lower energies. The fact that a large beam can not be considered as a point
source in relation to the detectors will only have small, and for most mea-
surements, insigniﬁcant eﬀect. The emittance blow-up will increase at lower
energies but will for most practical purposes be of little importance. However,
the large beam size requires a long active sweep range of the wire scanners to
avoid cut-oﬀ eﬀects which can result in signiﬁcant deviations of the measured
emittance from the true beam emittance.

Many thanks to Dr. Charles Steinbach for helpful discussions and to Marco
Pullia for patiently checking our equations and for helpful comments.

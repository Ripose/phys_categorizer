Abstract

Beginning with the general Bjorken-Mtingwa solution for intrabeam scattering (IBS) we derive

an accurate, greatly simpliﬁed model of IBS, valid for high energy beams in normal storage ring

lattices. In addition, we show that, under the same conditions, a modiﬁed version of Piwinski’s

IBS formulation (where η2

x,y/βx,y has been replaced by

Hx,y) asymptotically approaches the result

of Bjorken-Mtingwa.

INTRODUCTION

Intrabeam scattering (IBS), an eﬀect that tends to increase the beam emittance, is impor-

tant in hadronic[1] and heavy ion[2] circular machines, as well as in low emittance electron

storage rings[3]. In the former type of machines it results in emittances that continually

increase with time; in the latter type, in steady-state emittances that are larger than those

given by quantum excitation/synchrotron radiation alone.

The theory of intrabeam scattering for accelerators was ﬁrst developed by Piwinski[4], a

result that was extended by Martini[5], to give a formulation that we call here the standard

Piwinski (P) method[6]; this was followed by the equally detailed Bjorken and Mtingwa

(B-M) result[7]. Both approaches solve the local, two-particle Coulomb scattering problem

for (six-dimensional) Gaussian, uncoupled beams, but the two results appear to be diﬀerent;

of the two, the B-M result is thought to be the more general[8].

For both the P and the B-M methods solving for the IBS growth rates is time con-

suming, involving, at each time (or iteration) step, a numerical integration at every lattice

element. Therefore, simpler, more approximate formulations of IBS have been developed

over the years: there are approximate solutions of Parzen[9], Le Duﬀ[10], Raubenheimer[11],

and Wei[12]. In the present report we derive—starting with the general B-M formalism—

another approximation, one accurate and valid for high energy beams in normal storage ring

lattices. We, in addition, demonstrate that under these same conditions a modiﬁed version

of Piwinski’s IBS formulation asymptotically becomes equal to this result.

The Bjorken-Mtingwa Solution at High Energies

Let us ﬁrst consider 1/Tp as given by Eq. 2. We ﬁrst notice that, for normal storage ring

lattices (where

hHx,y/βx,yi ≪

1), the oﬀ-diagonal elements in L,

γφ, are small and can be

set to zero. Then all matrices are diagonal. Let us also limit consideration to high energies,

Our approximate IBS solution is Eqs. 10,13. Note that Parzen’s high energy formula is a

similar, though more approximate, result to that given here[9]; and Raubenheimer’s approx-

imation is formulas similar, though less accurate, than Eq. 10 and identical to Eqs. 13[11].

Note that the beam properties in Eqs. 10,13, need to be the self-consistent values. Thus,

for example, to ﬁnd the steady-state growth rates in electron machines, iteration will be

required. Note also that these equations assume that the zero-current vertical emittance is

due mainly to vertical dispersion caused by orbit errors; if it is due mainly to (weak) x-y
Hy = 0, drop the 1/Ty equation, and simply let ǫy = κǫx, with κ the coupling

Comparison of Modiﬁed Piwinski to the B-M Solution at High Energies

To compare with the B-M solution, let us consider a slightly changed version of Piwinski

that we call the modiﬁed Piwinski solution. It is the standard version of Piwinski, but with
(i.e. ˜a, ˜b, σh, become a, b, σH , respectively). Let us also assume high

≪

Let us sketch the derivation. First, notice that in the integral of the auxiliary function f

(Eq. 17): the

0.577 can be replaced by 0; the

3u2 in the numerator can be set to 0; P (Q)

−

−

can be replaced by √a2 + u2 (√b2 + u2). The ﬁrst term in the braces can be approximated

by a constant and then be pulled out of the integral; it becomes the eﬀective Coulomb log

factor. Note that for the proper choice of the Piwinski parameter d, the eﬀective Coulomb

log can be made the same as the B-M parameter (log). For ﬂat beams (a

b), the Coulomb

≪

log of Piwinski becomes (log) = ln [dσ2

H /(4r0a2)].

We see that the the approximate equation for 1/Tp for high energy beams according to

modiﬁed Piwinski is the same as that for B-M, except that h(a, b) replaces g(a/b).

We can now show that, for high energy beams, h(a, b)

g(a/b): Consider the function
˜h(a, b, ζ), which is the same as h(a, b) except that the upper limit of integration is inﬁnity, and
the u2 in the denominator are replaced by ζu2. It is simple to show that ∂ζ ˜h(a, b, ζ)
|ζ=1 =
g(a/b) = ˜h(a, b, 1). Now for high energies (a,b small), reducing the upper limit in the
integral of ˜h(a, b, 1) to 1 does not signiﬁcantly change the result, and h(a, b)

g(a/b). To

demonstrate this, we plot in Fig. 2 the ratio h(a, b)/g(a/b) for several values of a. We
see, for example, for the ATF with ǫy/ǫx ∼
h(a, b)/g(a/b) = 0.97; the agreement is quite good.

Finally, for the relation between the transverse to longitudinal growth rates according to

modiﬁed Piwinski: note that for non-zero vertical dispersion the second term in the brackets
Hx,y), will tend to dominate over the ﬁrst term,

of Eqs. 14 (but with η2

x,y/βx,y replaced by

and the results become the same as for the B-M method.

In summary, we have shown that for high energy beams (a,b

1), in rings with a

≪

standard type of storage ring lattice:

if the parameter d in P is chosen to give the same

equivalent Coulomb log as in B-M, then the modiﬁed Piwinski solution agrees with the

Bjorken-Mtingwa solution.

NUMERICAL COMPARISON[3]

We consider a numerical comparison between results of the general B-M method, the

modiﬁed Piwinski method, and Eqs. 10,13. The example is the ATF ring with no coupling

and vertical dispersion due to random orbit errors. For our example

= 17 µm, yielding

hHyi

a zero-current emittance ratio of 0.7%; the beam current is 3.1 mA. The steady-state growth

rates according to the 3 methods are given in Table I. We note that the Piwinski results are

4.5% low, and the results of Eqs. 10,13, agree very well with those of B-M. Finally note that,

not only the growth rates, but even the diﬀerential growth rates—i.e. the growth rates as

function of position along the ring—agree well for the three cases.

Abstract

The study of beam transport is of central importance to
the design and performance assessment of modern parti-
cle accelerators.
In this work, we benchmark two con-
temporary codes - DIMAD and BDSIM, the latter being
a relatively new tracking code built within the framework
of GEANT4. We consider both the 20 mrad and 2 mrad
extraction lines of the International Linear Collider (ILC)
and we perform tracking studies of heavily disrupted post-
collision electron beams. We ﬁnd that the two codes mostly
give an equivalent description of the beam transport.

INTRODUCTION

In a high-energy e+e− linear collider such as ILC [1],
the beams must be focused to extremely small spot sizes
in order to achieve high charge densities and, in turn, to
reach the desired luminosity. This leads to large angular
divergence and energy spread for the disrupted beams,
as well as to the emission of beamstrahlung photons. A
careful design of the extraction lines must therefore be
performed to transport these outgoing beams from the
interaction point to their dumps with small losses. At ILC,
two conﬁgurations are being studied for the crossing angle
at the interaction point and, as a result, for the design of
the post-collision lines. With a 2 mrad crossing angle, the
main challenge is the extraction of the disrupted beam,
which has to be achieved by sending the outgoing beam
off-center in the ﬁrst large super-conducting defocusing
quadrupole of the ﬁnal focus beam line, as well as in the
two nearby sextupoles [2]. On the other hand, with a

ties under the 6th Framework Programme ”Structuring the European
Research Area”, contract number RIDS-011899.

20 mrad crossing angle [3], one must deal with technical
difﬁculties such as large crab-crossing corrections or the
construction of compact super-conducting quadrupoles for
the incoming beam lines, as well as with the passage of
the beams through the solenoid ﬁeld with an angle. For
the design of the ILC extraction lines, it is essential to
have a reliable simulation program for particle tracking. In
this study, we present a comparison between two codes,
DIMAD [4] and BDSIM [5], using the present versions of
the ILC post-collision lines for benchmarking purposes, in
both large and small crossing angle cases.

The DIMAD program speciﬁcally aims at studying the
behaviour of particles in beam lines, by computing their
trajectories using the second order matrix formalism [6].
The present version of the code ensures that the matrix
treatment is correct to all orders for energy deviations [4].
This is important, as the ILC disrupted beams downstream
of the interaction point can have very large energy spreads.
As for the BDSIM program [5], it uses the closed solu-
tions in linear elements, whilst for higher-order elements,
a GEANT4-like stepper integration method is used. The
program is written in GEANT4 [7] and provides a toolkit
to simulate interactions of particles with the surrounding
matter once they have left the vacuum pipe. However, for
the purpose of this study, we only aim at comparing the
tracking procedures in DIMAD and BDSIM.

DIMAD AND BDSIM TRACKING IN THE
20 MRAD EXTRACTION LINE

For this benchmarking study, we use the nominal beam
parameters for ILC at 500 GeV, for which the beam
transport from the interaction point to the dump is almost
loss-free (at least with the low-statistics input ﬁles that we
use). The particle distributions for the disrupted beams at

the interaction point were obtained with GUINEA-PIG [8]
and then transported, with DIMAD or BDSIM, along the
ILC 20 mrad extraction line. The optics used for this study
consists of a DFDF quadruplet, followed by two vertical
chicanes for energy and polarization measurements and a
long ﬁeld-free region that allows the beam to grow natu-
rally, with two round collimators to reduce the maximum
beam size at the dump, see Figure 1.

and ﬁnally a long ﬁeld-free region to allow the beam to
grow to the dump, in the same way as in the 20 mrad
scheme. Note that, in the 2 mrad scheme, separate dumps
are used for the charged beam and for the beamstrahlung
photons.

Figure 1: Betatron functions and vertical dispersion along
the ILC extraction line with a 20 mrad crossing angle.

At several locations of interest, we project the transverse
beam distributions obtained with each program into binned
histograms and we compare them quantitatively. An illus-
tration of this procedure is shown in Figures 2 and 3 for
the transverse beam distributions obtained respectively at
the secondary focus point Mexfoc, located at s = 142.4 m
(where βx and βy are very small, with a vertical dispersion
of 2 cm) and at the dump. The open circles show the ratio
between the number of events found by DIMAD or BDSIM
in a given histogram bin and the error bars account for the
limited number of events per bin (very few events are found
in the tails, which explains the large error bars there). The
transverse distributions of the disrupted beams were also
computed with DIMAD and BDSIM at several other loca-
tions in the 20 mrad extraction line. Their comparison also
showed excellent agreement.

DIMAD AND BDSIM TRACKING IN THE
2 MRAD EXTRACTION LINE

When the colliding beams cross with a small horizontal
angle of 2 mrad, the outgoing disrupted beam passes off-
axis through the bore of the ﬁnal quadrupole QD0, both ﬁ-
nal sextupoles, but not the second-to-ﬁnal quadrupole QF1.
However, the outgoing beam sees the pocket ﬁeld of this
latter magnet. Following this doublet, the beam is focused
with a series of large bore quadrupoles. These are followed
by a vertical energy clean-up chicane, diagnostic chicanes
for the purpose of energy spectrometry and polarimetry,

Figure 4: Betatron functions along the ILC 2 mrad post-

the ﬁnal doublet of the incoming beam line (bottom).

Following the BDSIM/DIMAD comparison in 20 mrad
scheme, we now simply describe the results obtained for
the 2 mrad case, using exactly the same beam. Figures 5
to 7 show the results of the comparison at three locations
along the 2 mrad extraction line. Figures 5 and 6 show
the comparison at Mexfoc1 (located just after the energy
clean-up chicane) and at Mexfoc2 (the secondary focus of
the polarimetry chicane), respectively. As for Figure 7, it
shows the comparison at the beam dump.

In these plots, we have projected the transverse beam dis-
tributions obtained from the particle tracking into bins, and
we have then formed the ratio of the DIMAD prediction to
the BDSIM prediction. As in the previous section, the open
circles show the ratio, with the error bars accounting for
the limited number of events in a given bin. All diagrams
show a good agreement between DIMAD and BDSIM for
the ILC 2 mrad extraction line, except at the secondary
focus of the polarimetry chicane (Mexfoc2), where slight

CONCLUSION

In this paper, we performed a detailed benchmarking
study of two particle tracking codes, DIMAD and BDSIM.
For this purpose, we have considered the ILC extraction
lines with a crossing angle of 2 mrad or 20 mrad and,
in each of these two conﬁgurations, we have performed
tracking studies of disrupted post-collision electron beams.
Here, only the nominal luminosity case of the 500 GeV
machine was studied. We ﬁnd that both programs give an
equivalent description of the beam transport in all parts of
the post-collision lines, except at the secondary focus for
the 2 mrad design, where a small difference is visible.

Abstract

We discuss the proposal of Bell and Leinaas (BL) to measure the circular Unruh eﬀect
in storage rings. The ideal concept ‘circular Unruh eﬀect’ has a more realistic correspondent
such as ‘circular vacuum noise’ used by Shin Takagi [Prog. Theor. Phys. Suppl. 88, 1 (1986)]
The BL resonance behavior does not ﬁt to the SPEAR ﬁrst order betatron resonance at 3.605
GeV, but of course, the real experimental situation is much more complicated, corresponding,
as a matter of fact, to an even more general term that one may call ‘synchrotron noise’. In
the ﬁnal section we focus on radiometric aspects of storage ring physics, such as the problem
of establishing better quantum ﬁeld radiometric standards at high energies. The Unruh-like
eﬀect could be a useful guide for that purpose.

Introduction

About thirty years ago Sokolov and Ternov showed that electrons circulating in a vertical and

uniform magnetic ﬁeld get polarized [1]. This occurs because in the quantum synchrotron

emissions there is a very small spin-ﬂip power( only 10−11 of the classical continuous power),

which is accumulating over a timescale of tens of minutes to a few hours to give a ﬁnal asymptotic

polarization Plim = 8/(5√3) = 0.924. This number found three decades ago as the result

of a simple theoretical QED exercise is today a famous ﬁgure of accelerator physics.

In the

seventies, Derbenev and Kondratenko [2] obtained a more realistic formula for the limiting

beam polarization containing the spin-orbit coupling function. This vector parameter expresses

1e-mail: rosu@ifug3.ugto.mx

the correlations among the positions of the synchrotron emission events on the orbit and the spin

motion (ﬂuctuations of the precession axes). It is completely determined by the magnetic lattice

of the accelerator. In a certain sense we could say that the synchrotron vacuum ﬂuctuations are

angularly constrained by the magnetic boundaries of the guiding structure via the spin axis of

the electrons (a kind of magnetic orientational Casimir eﬀect).

The Sokolov-Ternov eﬀect has been conﬁrmed at the major synchrotrons and storage rings

of the world. Even at LEP, the largest storage ring at the moment, a Compton polarimeter

detected some polarization [3]. Also transverse beam polarizations have been measured at

HERA by means of a laser polarimeter [4]. However, the whole spin game becomes technically

interesting because of the depolarizing resonances (DRs) that one encounters easily at any high

energy circular accelerator. In a way, accelerator DRs are similar to the classical resonances of

the Solar System, asteroid belt and planetary rings, of course at much diﬀerent scales of time

and space. The accelerator DR’s are a consequence of the anomalous (presumably irrational)
magnetic moment of the electron and the proton (a = g−2

2 ; ae = 0.00116, ap = 1.793). DRs

have been classiﬁed according to their cause and their parameters have been determined with

great accuracy. The point is that at high energies the density of DRs becomes embarassingly

large, a fact of great concern for the accelerator physicists.

2 Can one see the BL eﬀect ?

The DK polarization formula of 1973 is overwhelmingly used by accelerator people. It includes

in a well-established way the eﬀects of DRs on the equilibrium polarization. This formula reads

where FDK = γ ∂ ˆn

∂γ is the spin-orbit coupling function, which takes into account the depolarizing

eﬀects of jumps between various trajectories diﬀering from the reference closed orbit, ρ is the

bending radius, ˆb a unit vector along the transverse magnetic ﬁeld component. The brackets

indicate an average over the ring circumference and over the ensemble of particles in the beam.

The unit vector ˆn is the time-independent spin solution of the BMT equation, attached to each

particle trajectory.

2

On the other hand, motivated by Unruh thermal-like eﬀect, which can show up in circular

motion too (see section 3), Bell and Leinaas [5] developed a formalism which is closer to quantum

ﬁeld theory and therefore more acceptable by theoretical physicists. Aiming at very peculiar

eﬀects, ﬁrst of all, the correct way of taking into account vertical electron recoils, Bell and

Leinaas have been forced to consider the case when the spin-orbit function is zero. This is

valid only for perfectly aligned weak focusing storage rings for which the accelerating ﬁelds

are independent of arc length and the magnetic ﬁeld is vertical on the perfectly planar closed

orbit with a small magnetic gradient n =

(B/R)−1(∂B/∂r). The meaning of r is the radial

−

displacement from the closed orbit R. Usually the vertical betatron ﬂuctuations as determined

by the horizontal synchrotron emissions are a negligible eﬀect as compared to the more common

accelerator stochastic excitations. However, for weak focusing machines such eﬀects expressed

by Bell and Leinaas in terms of a parameter f have also a linear contribution to the limiting

polarization and become predominant over the main part of the stochastic excitations included

in the spin-orbit function of DK. Moreover, in an ideal perfectly aligned machine the DK spin-

orbit function is actually zero. The corresponding equilibrium betatron emittance of the vertical

oscillations is calculated by BL explicitly by means of the standard Lorentz-Dirac equation in

order to take into account the radiation damping (on the Langevin character of the Lorentz-

Dirac equation we shall comment in a future work, [6]). The ﬁnal BL polarization formula

is

PBL = (8/5√3)

where the BL parameter f is given by

(3)

In Eq.(3) γ is the relativistic kinematical factor, νs is the spin tune, (νs = aeγ = E/0.441(GeV )),

and Q2

β is the betatron tune.

The BL formula has the usual intrinsic betatron resonance condition νs = Qβ = √n. However

the f parameter implies a more intricate behavior of the polarization in passing through the

resonance, which should be isolated and of ﬁrst order, namely Peq drops from 0.924 to -0.169,

3

then increases to 0.992 to fall eventually to 0.924. A thorough comparison of the DK and BL

formalisms have been provided by Barber and Mane [7]. At the same time Mane has generalized

the BL result to the case of strong-focusing storage rings (see formula (41) in ref.

[7]). The

f parameter turns now to be a vector quantity deﬁned as f =

(2/γ)∂n/∂βb where again the

−

subscript b denotes the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld, not necessarily vertical. This allows a

coupling of the horizontal betatron and synchrotron oscillations to the vertical ﬂuctuations; n

is the chosen spin quantization axis. The only ﬁrst order resonance at which one might think

of a BL eﬀect on the SPEAR polarization data [8], is the resonance νs = 3 + νy at E= 3.605

GeV, but we have to emphasize that the experimental conditions are very diﬀerent from those

required by the ideal BL case. The SPEAR E= 3.605 GeV resonance would correspond to

n=67. This is already a rather high n to make the BL eﬀect unobservable. At SPEAR energies

we encounter a well developed forest of resonances not the isolated BL situation.Also SPEAR

has a superperiodicity of two for which all the odd resonances are forbidden. Their presence is

due only to higher order eﬀects, making them very narrow, (for an interpretation in terms of

nonlinear tunespreads see [9], [10]).

3 More about circular vacuum noise

We now come to the problem of interpretation. Bell and Leinaas were motivated in their partic-

ular treatment of ﬂuctuations in electron storage rings by the chance of revealing Unruh eﬀect

of vacuum ﬂuctuations. As it is well known there is a close parallel between Hawking eﬀect and

Unruh eﬀect [11]. Their proposal was chronologically the second one to detect such fundamental

eﬀects within terrestrial laboratories after that of Unruh [12], who developed a hydrodynamical

analogy for Hawking eﬀect. It has been considered as the most feasible one for a long time.

However, in their 1987 paper BL are aware of the diﬃculty of introducing a temperature param-

eter for synchrotron ﬂuctuations. We recall that for one parameter problems, like Schwarzschild

black holes and Rindler linear accelerated motion, the quantum ﬁeld vacuum turns formally into

an equilibrium thermal state. One may introduce a thermodynamic temperature directly related

to that one parameter of the problem, the Schwarzschild mass in the ﬁrst case, the constant

4

proper acceleration in the latter. There are papers connecting the usual QED bremsstrahlung

and zero-energy Rindler photons [13].

However, the situation is much diﬀerent in the uniform circular motion, and not only because

there is no horizon, but more important because the acceleration, despite being a constant, has

the rather peculiar form given by

are used.

The point is that in the circular motion the vacuum energy density cannot be written in the

canonical Planck spectrum form [14]. Since the Fourier transforms of the Wightman functions

have singularities of the branch cut type (implying Θ functions) one will ﬁnd out an energy

density of the vacuum ﬂuctuations as a sum over cyclotron harmonics. The quantum zero-point

noise is in this case of an intermediate nature between an additive and a multiplicative noise.

We shall address this very interesting problem in another work [6].

The vacuum energy density of a massless scalar ﬁeld in the circular case can be written as

follows [14]

From Eq.(5) one can see that to a certain power of the velocity many vacuum cyclotron harmonics

could contribute making the energy density spectrum a quasi-continuous one but with diﬀerent

shape and scale as compared with a pure Planckian spectrum.

The na¨ıve introduction of the circular-motion acceleration αc = γ2ω0v into the Planckian

expansion in velocity powers.

Hacyan and Sarmiento [15] developed a formalism, very close to the scalar case, for calculating

the vacuum stress-energy tensor of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in an arbitrarily moving frame and

applied it to a system in uniform rotation. They provided formulas for energy density, Poynting

ﬂux, and stress of the zero-point ﬁeld in such a frame. Moreover, Mane [16] has suggested the

5

Poynting ﬂux of Hacyan and Sarmiento to be in fact synchrotron radiation when coupled to an

electron.

The relationship of circular noise and Rindler noise has been under focus in the works of Letaw

[29], Gerlach [18], and Takagi [19]. These authors managed to determine an exact connection

for the massless scalar ﬁeld between the circular noise and so-called “drifted Rindler noise”

seen by a quantum detector which is uniformly accelerated but has also a constant speed in

the direction perpendicular to the acceleration. It is just the limiting case of inﬁnite radius for

circular uniform motion. In the three- dimensional Minkowski space the circular motion is a

helix winding around the time axis. The Rindler trajectory is also a helix this time winding

with an imaginary pitch around a space axis. They are examples of the six classes of stationary

motions obtained by Letaw [29] and possessing stationary noises. Nevertheless these stationary

noises do not satisfy the KMS condition, i.e., the principle of detailed balance in quantum ﬁeld

theory [6]. To quote Takagi [19], “the eﬀective temperature depends on the energy and does not

provide a very useful concept.”

4 On radiometry at storage rings

The considerations in the previous section make us expound a little on the (primary) radiometric

standards at high energies. As it is well known the common blackbody radiators are limited

103 K for technical reasons. The idea to use electron storage rings with their magneto-

to 3

×

brehmsstrahlung/synchrotron spectrum as primary radiometric standards at high energies is not

new, and important contributions have been made in the past [20]. Already 4 electron storage

rings working at 800 MeV, approximately, are used as radiometric standard sources: SURF II,

VEPP 2M, TERAS, and BESSY. The projected BESSY II will also be designed with regard to

radiometric applications [21]. The primary radiometric character of the synchrotron spectrum

is based on the famous spectral photon ﬂux formula of Schwinger [22].

If the comparison between the (non-thermal) magnetobrehmsstrahlung spectral distribution

and the (thermal) black body one is made by identifying their two maxima [23], one concludes

that for a beam of 1 GeV the “temperature” of the maximum of the brehmsstrahlung (syn-

6

chrotron) radiation is about 107 K. It is a gain of 4 orders of magnitude for the important ﬁeld

of radiometry. Nevertheless, as has been argued in section 3 above, we are not in completely

equivalent situations.The shapes of the two spectral densities are diﬀerent, i.e.,

for the synchrotron radiation, as compared to

for the blackbody radiation. In Eqs.(6) and (7) the y = ω

ωmax variable is a scaled frequency,
where ωmax is corresponding to the maximum of the synchrotron radiation ωmax = ωcγ3, ωc

being the cyclotron angular frequency.

One may hope to obtain non-thermal distributions from a thermal one by means of q-

deformations [24].

Indeed, the features of the emitted spectrum are strongly dependent on

the electron-photon interactions along the beam trajectory and a q-boson interpretation seems

natural.

In the search for a better primary radiometric standard we recall that a formal truly thermal

ambience such as the Unruh one is not a local property of the trajectory, but a global one [25].

We need a constant power spectrum uniformly distributed over the radiation spectrum of the

electron. To get this an undulator of a special type made of a collection of so-called “short

magnets” [26] is needed. For a single “short magnet”, it has been shown [26] that the electron

will radiate a white noise with the angular frequencies distributed from zero up to the frequency

ωshort = (c/l)γ2. Here l = 2αR is the arclength of the electron trajectory in the “short magnet”.

The criterion for a magnet to be a “short magnet” is α

mc2
E . They shift the maximum of the

≪

synchrotron radiation to longer wavelengths , and depending on their number we could move

the maximum of the synchrotron spectrum to whatever wavelength we like in the spectral width

of the quasi-white noise.

It seems therefore that various types of insertion devices will be of great help in the ﬁeld of

radiometry [27]. Especially for storage rings working at higher energies (ESRF, Spring 8, APS)

detailed models for the radiation at the insertion devices are required for its use in radiometry.

7

A highly interesting ﬁeld regarding the connections between the coherence and polarization

features of the insertion devices and radiometry is foreseeable (see [27] for a ﬁrst step in this

direction). It is known that even such a good simulator of blackbody radiation as cavity radiation

has a spatial frequency spectrum, which is not white over the real plane waves [28].

It is worth noting also that high-energy radiometry could be done in the future for other

types of brehmsstrahlungs, e.g., the beamstrahlung at linear colliders.

Radiation noises and radiometry at colliders are obviously connected with chaos problems.

Because in the phase space of a system possesing N dof’s the uncertainty principle replaces every

portion of the continuum of classical trajectories of states in each ¯hN volume cell by only one,

so-called quantum state, one immediately concludes that the physical quantum chaos is more

ordered than the classical (geometric) one. The latter is only a limiting pure mathematical

chaos from the point of view of real, physical measurement. But if one will insist to go beyond

quantum theory of physical measurements a knowledge of the topology and geometry of the

proximity of points is unavoidable [29].

5 Concluding Remarks

We presented a discussion of the ‘circular Unruh’ eﬀect put forth by Bell and Leinass [5].

Recently, Cai, Lloyd, and Papini [30] claimed that the spin-rotation-gravity coupling, also known

as Mashhoon eﬀect in gravitation theory [31], is practically stronger than the acceleration eﬀect

at all available energies, but the comparison is rather diﬃcult and not so direct. Another

interesting eﬀect is mentioned by Fr¨ohlich and Studer [32] for the case of non-electronic storage

rings. A beam of non-relativistic particles with spin display a variant of the Einstein-de Haas

eﬀect which could show up as a tidal Zeeman energy aﬀecting, after relaxing to a steady state,

the ratio of spin-up to spin-down ions in the beam.

Finally, we sketched above some radiometric aspects of storage ring physics that may be

useful for future detailed analyses.

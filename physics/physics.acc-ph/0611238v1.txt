Abstract

The Collective Beam-Beam interaction is studied in the framework of maps with a
“kick-lattice” model in the 4-D phase space of the transverse motion. A novel approach to
the classical method of averaging is used to derive an approximate map which is equivalent
to a ﬂow within the averaging approximation. The ﬂow equation is a continuous-time
Vlasov equation which we call the averaged Vlasov equation, the new model of this paper.
The power of this approach is evidenced by the fact that the averaged Vlasov equation has
exact equilibria and the associated linearized equations have uncoupled azimuthal Fourier
modes. The equation for the Fourier modes leads to a Fredholm integral equation of the
third kind and the setting is ready-made for the development of a weakly nonlinear theory
to study the coupling of the π and σ modes. The π and σ eigenmodes are calculated from
the third kind integral equation. These results are compared with the kick-lattice model
using our weighted macroparticle tracking code and a newly developed, density tracking,
parallel, Perron-Frobenius code.

Introduction

In this paper we introduce a new model for the collective beam-beam interaction for hadron
beams in 4D transverse phase space (2 degrees-of-freedom). This both generalizes and simpliﬁes
the work of [1, 2, 3, 4] on the collective beam-beam interaction in high energy colliders. In
addition, it extends the preliminary 1 degree-of-freedom collective case in [5]. Our model is
based on the classical method of averaging generalized to maps and collective forces. We do not
distribute the beam-beam force around the ring as is usually done. The technique we introduce
should be of general interest for studies of Vlasov systems with a localized perturbative collective
force.

In Section 2, we discuss our basic kick-lattice model for the evolution of the 4D phase space
densities of the two beams. In Section 3, we brieﬂy review the basic averaging theory which

1

is generalized in this paper. Previously, this averaging theory was applied to the weak-strong
beam-beam in one and two degrees-of-freedom [6, 7]. The equations of the kick-lattice model
will be transformed to a standard form for the method of averaging in Section 4 and the general
“averaged Vlasov equation” (AVE) will be derived (See equation (24)). We then introduce the
special case we treat in this paper, namely the case where the tunes of the two beams are
identical and are non-resonant. In this case the AVE has the property that any function of
the action only is an equilibrium solution. In Section 5, we linearize about these equilibria and
discuss the linearized equations and the associated third kind integral equation. In addition,
we compare our integral equation with the analogous integral equations which arise in the
standard plasma problem and in the beam dynamics problems concerning the longitudinal
dynamics with wake ﬁelds for a coasting beam and a bunched beam. In Section 6 we present
numerical results for the π and σ mode eigen-problems for an axially symmetric Gaussian
equilibrium and compare these results with simulations on the exact model of Section 2. In
Section 7 we give a summary and point to future work. An appendix is included which gives a
ﬁrst principles calculation of the beam-beam force.

2 The Kick-Lattice Model in 4D Phase Space

To describe the evolution equations, we refer to the bunches as “unstarred” and “starred”, and
for every quantity X describing the unstarred bunch, the quantity X ∗ describes the starred
bunch. The evolution equations are symmetric: the equation for the starred bunch is obtained
from the unstarred bunch by interchanging starred and unstarred quantities, so we mostly state
only the equation for the unstarred bunch.

We consider two counter-rotating particle bunches, which collide head on at a single interac-
tion point (IP). The electromagnetic interaction at the IP is determined up to a proportionality

(0, 0) in the case where ρ∗ is mirror symmetric and invariant under π

ρ∗(x, y) = ρ∗(

3 Map Averaging and Error Bounds

Here we give an overview of the averaging formalism, which we generalize in this paper, and
brieﬂy discuss error bounds. We consider the autonomous “kick-rotate” map in R2

with the small parameter ǫ. This is a model for the one degree of freedom weak-strong beam-
beam interaction and was discussed in [6]. The transformation

leads to the non-autonomous map

u = eJ22πnνv

vn+1 = vn + ǫ

J2∇vH(vn, nν),

where H(v, θ) = V (v1 cos(2πθ) + v2 sin(2πθ)). This is in a standard form for the method of
averaging in which the transformed dependent variable, v, is slowly varying. If ν is irrational,
then from Weyl’s equidistribution theorem [8] the average of H(v, nν) over n exists and is given
1
by ¯H(v) =
0 H(v, θ) dθ. It is therefore natural to ask, for what values of ν are solutions of
(10) approximated by solutions of the averaged map

R

wn+1 = wn + ǫ

J2∇w ¯H(wn).

Even though the maps in (8) and (10) are symplectic, the averaged map is not. However the
averaged ﬂow associated with (11) and deﬁned by

˙w = ǫ

J2∇w ¯H(w)
= O(ǫ) over O(1/ǫ) times. Since (12) is
w(n)
wn −
is Hamiltonian, and it is easy to show that
autonomous, (11) can be viewed as the Euler method for numerically integrating (12). Approx-
imating equation (10) with (11) is considered in our previous work [6], where we introduce the
concept of a far-from-low-order-resonance zone for ν. This zone is formed by removing a ﬁnite
number of intervals centered on low-order rationals, therefore ν needs to satisfy only ﬁnitely
many Diophantine conditions, and does not need to be irrational, which makes the formalism
= O(ǫ) is obtained without the
much more useful in the applications. The error bound
usual near-identity-transformation and is unchanged asymptotically if an O(ǫ2) term is added
to equations (8,10).

In [7], we extend the formalism of equations (8-12) to the weak-strong beam-beam interac-
tion in 2 degrees-of-freedom. The equation of motion corresponding to (8) is just equation (2)
with ρ∗
n replaced by the spatial density of the strong beam. We are working out the details of
the averaging theorem in this more complicated case with two frequencies [9]. Some ingredients
of our approach can be found in [10]. We generalize this to the collective beam-beam interaction
in the next section.

4 Map-Averaging for Vlasov Systems

We will begin by transforming (2) using a representation of the solution to the unperturbed,
ζ = 0, problem. The new coordinates will be slowly varying if ζ is small. As in the previous
section we could proceed by letting u =

qn+1 = qn + ζ

The transformation to (13) turned out to be a major advance in Sobol’s implementation of
the Perron-Frobenius (PF) method [11] (See [12] and [13] for a discussion of the PF method).
In addition, (13) is well suited for an error analysis which is in progress [14]. However, an
action-angle transformation may be better suited to understand approximate equilibria and
the associated linear analysis that we do here and that is how we will proceed.

The action-angle transformation from u = (x, y, px, py)T to slowly varying coordinates v =

(Θx, Θy, Jx, Jy)T is given by

x =

px =

2Jx βx sin(2πnνx + Θx)

2Jy/βy cos(2πnνy + Θy).

Note that for ﬁxed J and Θ these are solutions of the equations of motion with ζ = 0, that is

The integral in (20) is taken over [0, 2π] in the Θ’s and over [0,
) in the J’s. Since the
transformation is symplectic it is also volume preserving. Thus the (Θ, J)-density is given by
Ψn(v) = ψn(u), and its evolution law is

Clearly vn and v∗
n are slowly varying for ζ and ζ ∗ small, and it follows that the transformed
densities Ψ and Ψ∗ are slowly varying. Thus (19) is in a standard form for averaging and
we now follow the procedure laid out in the previous section. The averaged map problem is
obtained from (19) by replacing H by the appropriate n-average ¯H and dropping the O(ζ 2)
term. The associated averaged ﬂow problem is autonomous and has the Hamiltonian form

of (24) over (2) is that the step size in a numerical integration of (24) can be O(1/max(ζ, ζ ∗))
which is much larger than one turn.

At this stage the problem is general with parameters (νx, νy, ν∗

the correct averaged Hamiltonian ¯H depends on the relation between the four tunes. Here we
discuss the case νx = ν∗
y because (i) we wish to compare and contrast our results
with [3, 4] and (ii) it simpliﬁes the calculation of the average. In this case G(
) in (20) can
be rewritten as G(Dx sin(2πnνx + ϕx), Dy sin(2πnνy + ϕy)), where

and the phases ϕx and ϕy are easily determined from the trigonometry involved. If in addition
we consider the case where νx and νy are non-resonant (in the sense that kxνx + kyνy = k0 ⇒
kx = ky = k0 = 0), then the averaging over nνx and nνy can be done separately and each
average can be replaced by the associated integral. Thus the averaged Hamiltonian becomes

where ¯G(Dx, Dy) := 1/(2π)2
T2 G(Dx sin tx, Dy sin ty) dtx dty and as before v = (Θ, J). From
our experience with the non-collective case [6, 7], we expect this to be valid for νx, νy far from
low-order resonances; work on the error estimates is in progress [14]. Note that H = H ∗ if
βx = β∗

x and βy = β∗
y .

Because of the convolution structure of the Θ integral in (27) (see (25)) any function Ψ∗ =
e(J) results in ¯H being independent of Θ. It follows that any pair of densities Ψe and Ψ∗

Ψ∗
that are independent of Θ are an equilibrium pair for (24). Since ψn(x, y, px, py) = Ψn(Θ, J)
≈
+ βxp2
Ψe(J) = Ψe
, we see that (2) and equivalently (19) have quasi-
x
equilibria given the averaging approximation.
In [5], we have veriﬁed this in the 2D phase
space case. Figure 1 shows the evolution of two action densities at a hundred out of more
than 105 turns under the exact map, the 2D analog of (4), using the PF method for tracking
10−3. The red
phase space densities. The parameters are ν = ν∗ = √5
crosses represent the evolution of a quasi-equilibrium, namely the centered Gaussian Ψ0(Θ, J) =
Ψe(J) = 1/(2πε)e−J/ε (for ε = 1), while the green
’s stand for a Gaussian that was initially
shifted by 1σx, giving a Θ-dependent density. Since the red crosses for diﬀerent discrete J lie on
top of each other, Ψe hardly evolves over the 105 turns which is consistent with the averaging
result. The Θ-dependent density however, ﬂuctuates as is indicated by the band of green
’s.
Thus we have strong evidence for the existence of quasi-equilibria, however we believe that (4)
does not admit exact equilibria. This is in contrast to the lepton case, see [15].

but we do not pursue (28) in that generality here. Instead we investigate solutions, which exist

in (28) are coupled, while f + and f − in (29) are not. Moreover, the σ and π modes can
be intuitively interpreted as in-phase and 180◦ out-of-phase perturbations respectively to the
starred and unstarred beam. Note that t in (28) is dimensionless (same as n in (22)) whereas
τ in (29) has the dimension of a length. Note also that the beam current, which is a factor of
ζ, has been scaled out of the problem. Thus there can be no threshold for instability in our
problem.

and are called Fredholm integral equations of the third kind (see p.2 [16]). If a is bounded away
from zero it can be transformed into a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. Thus
the primary interest in this third kind equation is in the case where a has zeros and this is our
case. The case where a has zeros is complicated by the fact that there are generalized solutions
which are diﬃcult to represent numerically.

Equations (38) and (40) have analogues in both plasma physics and other beam dynamics
contexts. For example, Crawford and Hislop [17] discuss the standard plasma problem in the
periodic case, the case of this paper, summarizing both the Landau and the van Kampen-Case
solutions ([18], [19], [20]). Jackson [21] gives a nice presentation of the Landau approach in the
non-periodic case. The third kind integral equations are given in equations (17) and (23) of [17]
and in equation (3.5) of [21]. As is well known, the plasma problem leads to Landau damping
and growth for certain equilibria depending on the size of the average density. The stability
analysis is facilitated by the dispersion function which uncouples the calculation of the poles of
the solution from the calculation of the density itself.

Two standard beam dynamics problems concern the longitudinal dynamics with wake ﬁelds
for a coasting beam and for a bunched beam. The coasting beam case is completely analogous
to the periodic plasma problem including a dispersion function and possible Landau damping
for small beam current and an instability threshold at some critical current after which there is
Landau growth. A recent discussion of the coasting beam problem in the context of coherent
synchrotron radiation is given in [22]. The third kind integral equation is given in equation
(27) of that paper. The emphasis in [22] is on the threshold for instability which occurs when
a zero of the dispersion function reaches the real axis as the current increases from small
values. Landau damping is not discussed as it is not important for the stability discussion and
furthermore would require an analytic continuation into the lower half ω plane which would
require assumptions on the equilibrium (see p.7 in [22]).

The bunched beam case is more complicated as the Fourier modes do not decouple. Fur-
thermore, it appears at ﬁrst sight that the calculation of the instability threshold must be done
in combination with the calculation of the density. However, Warnock has introduced a reg-
ularization transformation which eliminates the continuous spectrum. The resulting equation
is then discretized leading to a determinant condition, independent of the density, which is
analogous to the dispersion relation. A convergence theorem would then make this rigorous.
This is discussed in [23], where equation (11) is very similar to our equation (38). However the
kernel of the integral equation is much diﬀerent and, in fact, one expects a stability threshold.
It is in this paper that Warnock introduces his regularization transformation which eliminates
the continuous spectrum and thus eliminates the numerical problem of representing generalized
functions numerically. More recent progress on the regularization is given in [24].

Our equations (38) and (40) are simpler than the longitudinal bunched beam equations in
that the Fourier modes are uncoupled. Also, our case is rather special in that it does not depend
on the beam current as mentioned above. In fact the π and σ eigen-modes are neutrally stable

of the linearized AVE (43) for the case of ν = ν∗, (νx, νy) far-from-low-order-resonance and for
equilibria with k
= 0, that despite the presence of an amplitude dependent tune shift
and a collective force, the modes show neither damping nor growth but instead are stable. In
[26, 13] we have given numerical evidence that the modes are indeed remarkably stable even in
the fully nonlinear regime of tracking with equation (2).
We have tried to show that eigensolutions (ω, ˆf ±

k ) of (40) for equilibria, which do not satisfy
R, but
the above condition, k
have been unsuccessful. This leaves open the possibility of complex eigenvalues. Since these
must come in complex conjugate pairs, there is the possibility of linearly (and thus nonlinearly)
unstable solutions.

We have assumed that the two beams have the same nonresonant tunes and this is probably
the reason that the eigensolutions are neutrally stable. Previous work indicates that when the
tunes are diﬀerent (a so-called tune split) or near-to-low-order resonance there can be Landau
damping or growth. In [25], the authors develop a perturbation procedure in the near resonance
case and argue that there are regions of stability and instability (see Figure 2 of [25] ). Landau
damping is also discussed in [4]. In [26], we have seen evidence for Landau damping in the 2D
phase space case (See Figures 5-7 of[26] ). A future problem for us is to determine the explicit
form of the averaged equations in this case.

Equation (43) and the associated Laplace transformed equation can be rewritten as (T
−
ωI)ˆg± = h. Since T is symmetric, we are looking for conditions which ensure that it is a
bounded selfadjoint operator on an appropriate Hilbert space. Such operators have a well
developed spectral theory. For example, the spectrum is a compact subset of the real line
contained in the interval [m, M] where both m and M are ﬁnite spectral values and all spectral
values are either in the point spectrum (eigenvalues) or the continuous spectrum, thus the
residual spectrum is empty [27]. Numerical results, in the section to follow, indicate that for
kT = (1, 0) or (0, 1) the spectrum is the interval [0, k
Ω(0)] for the σ mode with 0 an eigenvalue
·
and [0, k
Ω(0) an eigenvalue. A possible explanation
for the stability of the modes using the notion of the “Landau resonance” is that the modes can
not resonantly exchange energy with a macroscopic fraction of the particles in the beam. The
σ mode tune lies at the edge of the incoherent (continuous) spectrum towards inﬁnite orbital
amplitudes. Any sensible phase space density falls oﬀ rapidly at large amplitudes (or even has
compact support) so that the fraction of particles with tunes in resonance with the σ mode
tune vanishes. The π mode tune, in the studied parameter regime, lies considerably outside the
incoherent spectrum and is thus even less able to dissipate its energy among the single particle
trajectories or to draw energy from them.

6 Numerical Results for π and σ Modes

The analysis of the spectrum for equation (43) gives important information about the π and
σ modes. In this section, we discuss properties of solutions of (43) and give our results on the
numerical solution of this eigenvalue problem.

If ω is outside of the range of k

Ω(J), (43) can be reduced to an integral equation of the
Ω(J),
second kind by a simple algebraic transformation. Conversely, if ω is in the range of k
then (43) it must be treated as a third kind equation. Such equations have not been studied as
extensively as Fredholm integral equations of the ﬁrst and second kind. A review of work up

recently, we have become aware of [30, 31, 32]. However, to our knowledge, the case when J is
2-dimensional has not been discussed nor have convergent numerical schemes been developed.
As mentioned in the previous section the plasma problem and the coasting beam problems are
of this type and have been studied extensively, however these are particularly simple.

We now discuss the commonly used, straightforward discretization for integral equations of
the third kind as applied to our special case and give our numerical results. At the end of this
section we will discuss progress on work toward a convergent scheme. In the straightforward
approach, J is put on a mesh and the integral is approximated by a simple quadrature method.
This leads to a ﬁnite dimensional matrix eigenproblem and seems to lead to reasonable results.
This approach has been used in 1D in the beam-beam interaction in [3, 4], in the longitudinal
bunched beam case in [33] and by us in the 1D beam-beam interaction, [13]. In [13] we obtained
excellent agreement between the FFT spectra of the dipole modes in full blown simulations and
the eigenvalues of a one degree-of-freedom version of (43).

We consider the special case of axially symmetric Gaussian beams, where

number of independent variables from four as in (24) to two, the evaluation of the functions
Ω(J) and ˆKk(J, J ′) is in fact computationally expensive. The computation of Ω =
¯H[Ψe]
involves a 6-fold integral at each point of the 2D mesh in J and ˆKk involves a 4-fold integral at
each point of a 4D mesh in (J, J ′). Although we found a way to slightly simplify the calculation
for general Ψe, and reduce the 6-fold integral to a 5-fold integral, going to larger meshes is quite
expensive. However, for the important particular choice of (44) we found a very simple formula
involving modiﬁed Bessel functions:

and 5 show that these eigenvalues corresponds to regular eigenfunctions. FFT spectra obtained
by tracking, with our newly written parallel Perron-Frobenius code [11], which tracks the phase
space densities directly in 4D phase space, and with our 4D weighted macro particle tracking
code [13], shows pronounced peaks at tunes that correspond to these discrete eigenvalues. This
indicates an excellent agreement between these three completely diﬀerent approaches. We
consider this a major feat.

Even though our results are quite satisfactory, we are interested in a convergent procedure.
A well established theory (See e.g., [35]) guarantees that the above described ﬁnite dimensional
approximation of the integral equation converges as long as the operator is compact. However,
as we mentioned before, Figure 3 indicates the presence of a continuous spectrum, which a com-
pact operator can not have. In addition, the numerically computed “eigenfunctions” associated
with the continuous spectrum show a singular behavior, as illustrated in Figure 6. This is to be
expected [28, 29] and thus these third kind integral equations are not well suited for numerical
analysis in their standard form. Therefore further numerical and analytical analysis requires a
special treatment of equation (43). Such diﬃculties are common for equation (41) where a(x)

13

vanishes at least once inside of its domain. The recent work for the longitudinal bunched beam
Vlasov equation in [23, 24] mentioned above, suggests that the continuous spectrum can be
eliminated by the Warnock regularization transformation g(J, ω) = (ω
Ω(J))ˆg(J, ω). This

where the solutions (g(J, ω), ω) for η =

As mentioned before, equation (41) appears in other physics applications, and analytical
results have been published in [28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. We have begun a study of this problem in our
particular case. Speciﬁcally, the existence and uniqueness of solutions of equation (43) in the
one and two-dimensional cases has been addressed in [36]. In [36], we consider functions which
are continuous except for pole-like singularities at J such that (ω
Ω(J)) = 0, and interpret
the integrals over the singularities in the principal value sense. Under certain assumptions, we
proved a version of the Fredholm alternative theorem: the equation has a unique solution for
any right-hand side iﬀ the homogeneous version of this equation has only the trivial solution.
In addition, this framework may provide a numerically convergent scheme for solving (43).
Alternatively, we are looking for conditions so that discretization of the Warnock transformed
problem will lead to a convergent method. The theory of [36] is a ﬁrst step.

7 Summary and Future Work

An important aspect of collective beam-beam theory has been the study of the so-called π and σ
modes. The pioneering works of [1, 2, 3, 4] represent a major advance; however approximations
are made, the validity of which we would like to understand better. For example, in [3, 4],
the starting point is a Vlasov equation with a delta function kick and the beam-beam kick is
distributed around the ring by smoothing the delta function. The Vlasov equation is linearized
about a function which is only an approximate equilibrium and action-angle variables are
introduced. The Fourier modes in angle are not uncoupled at this stage but a horizontal dipole
mode proportional to exp(iΘx) is assumed. This leads to an inconsistent equation. To obtain
a consistent equation for this mode an average over the angle variables is taken which, after
a Fourier transform in time, leads to an integral equation, the analog of equation (43).
In
contrast, we start with the kick-lattice model to properly handle the delta function kick. Then
we make only one approximation, the averaging approximation, and in addition, as stated
earlier, we believe we can give an upper bound on the error of approximation. Our AVE has
exact equilibria and thus our exact problem has quasi-equilibria in good agreement with our
simulations. The linearization about these equilibria leads to an equation, which in contrast
to the above, has uncoupled Fourier modes. The Fourier modes satisfy an integral equation
that is easily transformed to a formally selfadjoint problem. We are looking for conditions such
that the associated operator is bounded and selfadjoint, a case which has a well developed
theory. The standard computation of the π and σ dipole mode frequencies discussed in Section
6 is in good agreement with density tracking based on equation (4), using both the PF and
the weighted macro-particle tracking methods. However the standard numerical approach to
numerically solving (43) does not converge as the mesh size decreases beyond some limit and
we are searching for convergent algorithms such as that suggested in [23, 36].

In summary, we have introduced a new model, the averaged Vlasov equation (24), for the

14

collective beam-beam interaction in two degrees of freedom, which we believe has signiﬁcant
potential for deepening our understanding of this important collective eﬀect.

Equation (24) was derived in the spirit of the rigorous analysis in [6]. We believe similar error
bounds can be derived, thus we believe (24) gives a good approximation to the basic dynamics
of (2). In fact, we have checked the one degree-of-freedom analog of (24) with two aspects of
a full-blown density tracking approach, the existence of quasi-equilibria and the calculation of
the π and σ mode eigenvalues, with excellent results. More importantly, we have checked the
two degree-of-freedom AVE with two full-blown simulation codes and have also found excellent
agreement in the calculation of π and σ mode eigenvalues. Thus we have conﬁdence in the
model.

We have demonstrated its usefulness as a tool for calculating π and σ mode eigenvalues
and for clarifying the existence of quasi-equilibria. In the case of leptons, progress has been
made on the question of the existence of an equilibrium for the exact model [15]. However, it
seems likely that exact equilibria do not exist in the hadron case as the underlying dynamics
is likely to be chaotic. In addition, the AVE may lead to a faster algorithm for calculating the
density evolution. This is because the beam-beam parameters, ζ and ζ ∗, are small and thus the
time step in numerical integration of (24) can be O(1/max(ζ, ζ ∗)), which is signiﬁcantly larger
than one turn. We propose to investigate this potential speed up by developing a numerical
procedure to integrate (24). As another example, the AVE will be useful in taking the next
step beyond the linear theory to investigate coupling between the π and σ Fourier modes. In
the Laplace-picture, we may be able to use the ﬁxed point iteration scheme discussed for the
plasma problem in [37] or in the eigen-picture presented here we may be able to use the van
Kampen-Case approach [19, 20]. In the latter case, the work of [17] may be useful. Finally, we
can investigate several other eﬀects such as those discussed by Alexahin [4]. Some topics we are
considering for future work are: (i) a study of the near-to-low-order resonance case as we do
in [6] (ii) adding another degree of freedom to study the eﬀect of synchrotron motion into the
dynamics of equation (2) and (iii) a study of the eﬀect of a tune split by letting ν∗
x = νx + ζa
and ν∗
y = νy + ζb and then applying our averaging formalism. Here (a, b) allow us to vary the
tune split in units of the kick parameter. As in [6] we expect bifurcations as a and b vary. Items
(i) and (iii) likely includes the possibility of both Landau damping and growth.

Our main point is that we now have a model in which many important collective beam-beam

interaction eﬀects can be studied in a more systematic way then was previously available.

A Derivation of the Beam-Beam Parameter

To calculate the kick we consider three inertial reference frames: the rest frame of the syn-
chronous particle of the unstarred bunch F , the lab frame F ′, and the rest frame of the syn-
chronous particle of the starred bunch F ∗. The coordinate axes of the three frames are parallel
and oriented so that viewed from the lab frame F ′, F is moving in the positive z direction with
β∗c. In what follows
velocity βc and F ∗ is moving in the negative z direction with velocity

−

we will consider the relative velocities of the particles with respect to the synchronous particle
of their bunch as non–relativistic.

We consider the momentum change of an unstarred particle moving through the starred
bunch. In the kick approximation, we assume that the transverse spatial coordinates are not
changed during the interaction, i.e. r(t) = (x, y, z + ut)T. Thus the change in transverse
momentum of an unstarred particle passing through the starred beam measured in F ∗ is

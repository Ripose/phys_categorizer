LOCAL ANALYSIS OF NONLINEAR RMS ENVELOPE DYNAMICS

A. Fedorova, M. Zeitlin, IPME, RAS, St. Petersburg, V.O. Bolshoj pr., 61, 199178, Russia ∗†

Abstract

We present applications of variational – wavelet approach
to nonlinear (rational) rms envelope dynamics. We have
the solution as a multiresolution (multiscales) expansion in
the base of compactly supported wavelet basis.

1

INTRODUCTION

In this paper we consider the applications of a new nume-
rical-analytical technique which is based on the methods
of local nonlinear harmonic analysis or wavelet analysis to
the nonlinear root-mean-square (rms) envelope dynamics
[1]. Such approach may be useful in all models in which it
is possible and reasonable to reduce all complicated prob-
lems related with statistical distributions to the problems
described by systems of nonlinear ordinary/partial differ-
ential equations.
In this paper we consider an approach
based on the second moments of the distribution functions
for the calculation of evolution of rms envelope of a beam.
The rms envelope equations are the most useful for analy-
sis of the beam self–forces (space–charge) effects and also
allow to consider both transverse and longitudinal dynam-
ics of space-charge-dominated relativistic high–brightness
axisymmetric/asymmetric beams, which under short laser
pulse–driven radio-frequency photoinjectors have fast tran-
sition from nonrelativistic to relativistic regime [2]. From
the formal point of view we may consider rms envelope
equations after straightforward transformations to standard
Cauchy form as a system of nonlinear differential equations
which are not more than rational (in dynamical variables).
Because of rational type of nonlinearities we need to con-
sider some extension of our results from [3]-[10], which
are based on application of wavelet analysis technique to
variational formulation of initial nonlinear problems.

Wavelet analysis is a relatively novel set of mathemat-
ical methods, which gives us a possibility to work with
well-localized bases in functional spaces and give for the
general type of operators (differential, integral, pseudod-
ifferential) in such bases the maximum sparse forms. Our
approach in this paper is based on the generalization [11] of
variational-wavelet approach from [3]-[10], which allows
us to consider not only polynomial but rational type of non-
linearities.

In part 2 we describe the different forms of rms equa-
tions.
In part 3 we present explicit analytical construc-
tion for solutions of rms equations from part 2, which are
based on our variational formulation of initial dynamical
problems and on multiresolution representation [11]. We

† http://www.ipme.ru/zeitlin.html; http://www.ipme.nw.ru/zeitlin.html

give explicit representation for all dynamical variables in
the base of compactly supported wavelets. Our solutions
are parametrized by solutions of a number of reduced al-
gebraical problems from which one is nonlinear with the
same degree of nonlinearity and the rest are the linear prob-
lems which correspond to particular method of calculation
of scalar products of functions from wavelet bases and their
derivatives. In part 4 we consider results of numerical cal-
culations.

2 RMS EQUATIONS

Below we consider a number of different forms of RMS en-
velope equations, which are from the formal point of view
not more than nonlinear differential equations with ratio-
nal nonlinearities and variable coefﬁcients. Let f (x1, x2)
be the distribution function which gives full information
about noninteracting ensemble of beam particles regard-
ing to trace space or transverse phase coordinates (x1, x2).
Then we may extract the ﬁrst nontrivial bit of ‘dynamical
information’ from the second moments

x1 = < x2

are also based on the second moments.

x,rms =< x2

We will consider the following particular cases of rms
envelope equations, which described evolution of the mo-
ments (1) ([1],[2] for full designation):
for asymmetric
beams we have the system of two envelope equations of
the second order for σx1 and σx2:

I/(I0(σx1 + σx2 )γ 3) + ε2

The envelope equation for an axisymmetric beam is a par-
ticular case of preceding equations.

Also we have related Lawson’s equation for evolution
of the rms envelope in the paraxial limit, which governs
evolution of cylindrical symmetric envelope under external

where Kr ≡ −Fr/rβ 2γmc2, β ≡ νb/c = p1 − γ−2

After transformations to Cauchy form we can see that
all this equations from the formal point of view are not
more than ordinary differential equations with rational non-
linearities and variable coefﬁcients (also,we may consider
regimes in which γ, γ′ are not ﬁxed functions/constants but
satisfy some additional differential constraint/equation, but
this case does not change our general approach).

3 RATIONAL DYNAMICS

The ﬁrst main part of our consideration is some variational
approach to this problem, which reduces initial problem to
the problem of solution of functional equations at the ﬁrst
stage and some algebraical problems at the second stage.
We have the solution in a compactly supported wavelet ba-
sis. An example of such type of basis is demonstrated on
Fig. 1. Multiresolution representation is the second main

part of our construction. The solution is parameterized by
solutions of two reduced algebraical problems, one is non-
linear and the second are some linear problems, which are
obtained from one of the standard wavelet constructions:
the method of Connection Coefﬁcients (CC) or Stationary
Subdivision Schemes (SSS).

So, our variational-multiresolution approach [11] gives
us possibility to construct explicit numerical-analytical so-
lution for the following systems of nonlinear differential
equations

˙z = R(z, t) or Q(z, t) ˙z = P (z, t),

(4)

where z(t) = (z1(t), ..., zn(t)) is the vector of dynamical
variables zi(t),

R(z, t) is not more than rational function of z,
P (z, t), Q(z, t) are not more than polynomial functions

of z and P,Q,R have arbitrary dependence of time.

The solution has the following form

z(t) = zslow

N (t) + Xj≥N

zj(ωjt), ωj ∼ 2j

(5)

N

which corresponds to the full multiresolution expansion in
all time scales. Formula (5) gives us expansion into a slow
part zslow
and fast oscillating parts for arbitrary N. So, we
may move from coarse scales of resolution to the ﬁnest one
for obtaining more detailed information about our dynami-
cal process. The ﬁrst term in the RHS of representation (5)
corresponds on the global level of function space decom-
position to resolution space and the second one to detail
space. In this way we give contribution to our full solu-
tion from each scale of resolution or each time scale. The
same is correct for the contribution to power spectral den-
sity (energy spectrum): we can take into account contribu-
tions from each level/scale of resolution.

So, we have the solution of the initial nonlinear (rational)

problem in the form

zi(t) = zi(0) +

N

Xk=1

λk
i Zk(t),

(6)

where coefﬁcients λk
i are roots of the corresponding re-
duced algebraical (polynomial) problem [11]. Conse-
quently, we have a parametrization of solution of initial
problem by solution of reduced algebraical problem.

So, the obtained solutions are given in the form (6),
where Zk(t) are basis functions and λi
k are roots of reduced
system of equations. In our case Zk(t) are obtained via
multiresolution expansions and represented by compactly
k are the roots of reduced poly-
supported wavelets and λi
nomial system with coefﬁcients, which are given by CC or
SSS constructions.

Each Zj(t) is a representative of corresponding multires-
olution subspace Vj, which is a member of the sequence of
increasing closed subspaces Vj:

...V−2 ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ ...

The basis in each Vj is

ϕjl(x) = 2j/2ϕ(2jx − ℓ)

(7)

(8)

where indices ℓ, j represent translations and scaling respec-
tively or action of underlying afﬁne group which act as a
“microscope” and allow us to construct corresponding so-
lution with needed level of resolution.

It should be noted that such representations (5),(6) for
solutions of equations (2),(3) give the best possible local-
ization properties in corresponding phase space.This is es-
pecially important because our dynamical variables corre-
sponds to moments of ensemble of beam particles.

4 NUMERICAL CALCULATIONS

In this part we consider numerical illustrations of previous
analytical approach. Our numerical calculations are based
on compactly supported Daubechies wavelets and related
wavelet families. On Fig. 2 we present according to formu-
lae (5),(6) contributions to approximation of our dynamical
evolution (top row on the Fig. 3) starting from the coarse

the ﬁnest one corresponding to the scales from 21 to 25
or from slow to fast components (5 frequencies) as details
for approximation. Then on Fig. 3, from bottom to top,
we demonstrate the summation of contributions from cor-
responding levels of resolution given on Fig. 2 and as result
we restore via 5 scales (frequencies) approximation our dy-
namical process(top row on Fig. 3 ).

We also produce the same decomposition/approximation
on the level of power spectral density (Fig. 4). It should
be noted that complexity of such algorithms are minimal
regarding other possible. Of course, we may use differ-
ent multiresolution analysis schemes, which are based on
different families of generating wavelets and apply such
schemes of numerical–analytical calculations to any dy-
namical process which may be described by systems of
ordinary/partial differential equations with rational nonlin-
earities [11].

I. MOTIVATION

High-energy muon beams have been proposed as uniquely powerful and incisive sources

for neutrino scattering and oscillation studies. They may also enable energy-frontier lepton-

antilepton colliders and may have unique advantages for studying the physics of electroweak

symmetry breaking. The production of high-energy muon beams at the intensities needed for

these applications will require muon-beam cooling [1, 2, 3, 4].

II. COOLING

To accelerate a secondary or tertiary beam it is desirable ﬁrst to decrease its size so that

a reasonable fraction of the produced particles will ﬁt inside the apertures of the beamline.

It is well known that a focusing element (e.g. a pair of quadrupole magnets with opposed

ﬁeld gradients) can decrease the area of a charged-particle beam while increasing its spread

in transverse momentum and, consequently, its divergence. This relationship is an example of

Liouville’s theorem: conservative forces cannot increase or decrease the volume occupied by a

beam in six-dimensional phase space [5].

Focusing alone does not suﬃce for eﬃcient acceleration of a secondary or tertiary beam, since

the resulting increase in divergence means the beam will exceed some other aperture further

downstream. What is needed instead is a process by which both the beam size and divergence

can be reduced. By analogy with refrigeration, which decreases the random relative motions of

the molecules of a gas, this is known as beam cooling.

It is convenient to represent the volume of phase space occupied by a beam by the beam’s

emittance. The emittance in a given coordinate can be expressed as

where σ designates root-mean-square, i = x, y, z, and the factor 1/mc is introduced so as

to express emittance in units of length (m is the mass of the beam particle and c the speed

of light). Neglecting possible correlations among the coordinates and momenta [6], we then

have ǫ6,n = ǫx,nǫy,nǫz,n for the six-dimensional emittance. The subscript n distinguishes these

normalized emittances from the frequently used unnormalized emittance

(1)

(2)

ǫi,n ≡ σiσpi/mc,

ǫi ≡ ǫi,n/γβ ,

2

where γ and β are the usual relativistic factors. In terms of (unnormalized) emittance, the

transverse beam sizes are given by

πσ2

x = βxǫx ,

πσ2

y = βyǫy ,

(3)

where βx, βy are the transverse amplitude functions of the focusing lattice in the x and y

directions, which characterize the focusing stength along the lattice (low βi corresponds to

strong focusing in the ith direction).

Since Liouville’s theorem tells us that normalized emittance is a constant of the motion, beam

cooling requires a “violation” of Liouville’s theorem. This is possible by means of dissipative

forces such as ionization energy loss [7], as described in more detail below.

III. MUON COOLING

Cooling of the transverse phase-space coordinates of a muon beam can be accomplished by

passing the beam through energy-absorbing material and accelerating structures, both embed-

ded within a focusing magnetic lattice; this is known as ionization cooling [7, 8]. Other cooling

techniques (electron, stochastic, and laser cooling) are far too slow to yield a signiﬁcant degree

of phase-space compression within the muon lifetime [9]. Ionization of the absorbing material

by the muons decreases the muon momentum while (to ﬁrst order) not aﬀecting the beam

size; by Eq. 1, this constitutes cooling. At the same time, multiple Coulomb scattering of the

muons in the absorber increases the beam divergence, heating the beam. Diﬀerentiating Eq. 1

with respect to path length, we ﬁnd that the rate of change of normalized transverse emittance

within the absorber is given approximately by [10, 11]

where angle brackets denote mean value, muon energy Eµ is in GeV, β⊥ is evaluated at the

location of the absorber, and LR is the radiation length of the absorber medium [12]. (This

is the expression appropriate to the cylindrically-symmetric case of solenoidal focusing, where

βx = βy ≡ β⊥.) The ﬁrst term in Eq. 4 is the cooling term and the second is the heating term.

To minimize the heating term, which is proportional to the β function and inversely pro-

portional to radiation length, it has been proposed [1] to use hydrogen as the energy-absorbing

medium, giving hdEµ/dsi ≈ 30 MeV/m and LR = 8.7 m [13], with superconducting-solenoid

focusing to give small β ∼ 10 cm [14]. Key issues in absorber R&D include coping with the

3

large heat deposition by the intense (∼ 1014/s) [15] muon beam and minimizing scattering in

absorber-vessel windows [16, 17, 18, 19].

An additional technical requirement is high-gradient reacceleration of the muons between

absorbers to replace the lost energy, so that the ionization-cooling process can be repeated

many times. Even though it is the absorbers that actually cool the beam, for typical radio-

frequency (RF) accelerating-cavity gradients (∼ 1 − 10 MeV/m), it is the RF cavities that

dominate the length of the cooling channel (see e.g. Fig. 1), and the achievable RF gradient

determines how much cooling is practical before an appreciable fraction of the muons have

decayed. We see from Eq. 4 that the percentage decrease in normalized emittance is proportional

to the percentage energy loss, thus cooling in one transverse dimension by a factor 1/e requires

≈100% energy loss and replacement. The expense of RF power favors low beam energy for

cost-eﬀective reacceleration, as do also the increase of hdE/dxi and the decreased width of the

dE/dx distribution at low momentum [13], and most muon-cooling simulations to date have

used hpi ≈ 200 − 300 MeV/c. We are pursuing R&D on high-gradient normal-conducting RF

cavities suitable for insertion into a solenoidal-focusing lattice [20].

Transverse ionization cooling causes the longitudinal emittance ǫz to grow. Several eﬀects

contribute to this growth: ﬂuctuations in energy loss in the absorbers (energy-loss straggling, or

the “Landau tail”) cause growth in the energy spread of the beam, as does the negative slope of

the hdE/dxi momentum dependence in the beam-momentum regime (below the ionization min-

imum) that we are considering [13]. Moreover, these low-momentum, large-divergence beams

have a considerable spread in propagation velocity through the cooling lattice, causing bunch

lengthening. These eﬀects result in gradual loss of particles out of the RF bucket. They could

be alleviated by longitudinal cooling.

Longitudinal ionization cooling is possible in principle, but it appears to be impractical [21].

Its realization would call for operation above the ionization minimum, where the hdE/dxi slope

with momentum is positive [13], but that slope is small and the resulting weak cooling eﬀect is

overcome by energy-loss straggling. Instead what is envisioned is emittance exchange between

the longitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom, decreasing the longitudinal emittance while

at the same time increasing the transverse. Conceptually, such emittance exchange can be

accomplished by placing a suitably shaped absorber in a lattice location where there is disper-

sion, i.e., using a bending magnetic ﬁeld to spread the muons out in space according to their

momenta, and shaping the absorber so as to absorb more energy from the higher-momentum

muons and less from the lower-momentum ones. (One can see that this is emittance exchange

4

rather than longitudinal cooling per se, since to the extent that the muon momentum spread

has been reduced by the shaped absorber, the beam can no longer be reconverged to a small

spot by a subsequent bend.) This is followed by transverse ionization cooling, the combined

process being eﬀectively equivalent to longitudinal cooling [22].

IV. COOLING-CHANNEL DESIGNS

A variety of focusing-lattice designs for transverse muon cooling have been studied, most

using solenoids as focusing elements. Especially for the large (≈ 0.6 m) aperture required at the

beginning of a muon cooling channel, stronger focusing gradients are possible using solenoids

than using quadrupoles, and unlike quadrupoles, solenoids have the virtue of focusing both

transverse dimensions simultaneously, giving a more compact lattice.

While a high-ﬁeld solenoid can produce a small (and constant) β⊥, it is straightforward

to see that a single such solenoid is not suﬃcient for muon cooling [23]. A charged particle

entering a solenoid oﬀ-axis receives a transverse magnetic kick from the fringe ﬁeld, such that

the particle’s straight-line motion in the ﬁeld-free region becomes helical motion within the

solenoid. The exit fringe ﬁeld must thus impart an equal and opposite kick so that the particle

resumes its straight-line motion in the subsequent ﬁeld-free region.

If within the solenoid the particle loses energy in an absorbing medium, the angular mo-

mentum of its helical motion must decrease, resulting in an imbalance between the entrance

and exit kicks. The particle then exits the magnet with a net angular momentum, implying

that a parallel beam entering an absorber-ﬁlled solenoid will diverge upon exiting. To cancel

this net angular momentum, the ﬁeld direction must alternate periodically. The simplest case

conceptually is focusing by a constant solenoidal ﬁeld, but with one “ﬁeld ﬂip” halfway along

the cooling channel [24]. The length of a uniform section can be of order 10 − 100 m. Better

performance can be achieved by adding a second ﬁeld ﬂip [25]. At an opposite extreme, the

solenoidal-ﬁeld direction can be ﬂipped every meter or so, leading to a variety of solenoidal-

focusing lattices dubbed alternating solenoid [1, 2, 23, 26], FOFO [21, 24, 27], DFOFO [26],

SFOFO (see Fig. 1), etc. [27, 28].

V. CONCLUSIONS

Detailed six-dimensional simulations show that enough transverse cooling can be achieved

to build a high-performance neutrino factory [15], using either a double-ﬂip or SFOFO cooling

lattice. For example, in Palmer’s recent SFOFO design an initial transverse normalized emit-

tance of 17π mm·mr is cooled in a 400-m-long cooling system to a ﬁnal emittance of 2.8π mm·mr
with ≈75% muon loss [15, 29]. Such a facility would produce ∼ 1020 neutrinos per year aimed

at a far detector that could be thousands of km from the source, giving oscillation sensitivity

at least two orders of magnitude beyond that of long-baseline experiments now under construc-

tion [3, 15]. Without longitudinal-transverse emittance exchange, transverse cooling reaches a

point of diminishing returns as emittance growth in the longitudinal phase plane causes muons

to be lost from the RF bucket. While emittance exchange would be helpful but not essential for

a neutrino factory, to achieve the considerably smaller emittances required in a muon collider,

it is mandatory. R&D on emittance exchange is ongoing, and several promising ideas are being

actively explored [22, 30].

[5] However, nonlinear conservative forces can cause phase-space “ﬁlamentation,” the practical eﬀect

of which is essentially growth of the beam’s occupied phase-space volume, and stochastic cooling

can be thought of as the opposite eﬀect, in which particles are moved in phase space to make

occupied regions of phase space more contiguous and move empty regions of phase space outside

of the beam envelope.

[6] More generally, letting V be the covariance matrix of (x, px, y, py, z, pz), the six-dimensional nor-

malized emittance is given by ǫ6,n ≡ det V/(mc)6.

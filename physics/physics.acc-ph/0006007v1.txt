Polarized Protons in HERA

Polarized proton beams at HERA can currently only be produced by extracting a beam
from a polarized source and then accelerating it in the three synchrotrons at DESY. In
this paper, the processes which can depolarize a proton beam in circular accelerators
are explained, devices which could avoid this depolarization in the DESY accelerator
chain are described, and speciﬁc problems which become important at the high energies
of HERA are mentioned. At HERA’s high energies, spin motion cannot be accurately
described with the isolated resonance model which has been successfully used for lower
energy rings. To illustrate the principles of more accurate simulations, the invariant
spin ﬁeld is introduced to describe the equilibrium polarization state of a beam and the
changes during acceleration.
It will be shown how linearized spin motion leads to a
computationally quick approximation for the invariant spin ﬁeld and how to amend this
with more time consuming but accurate non-perturbative computations. Analysis with
these techniques has allowed us to establish optimal Siberian Snake schemes for HERA.

1. INTRODUCTION

In contrast to polarized high energy electron beams which can become polarized by
the emission of spin ﬂip synchrotron radiation, proton beams do not become polarized
after acceleration. High energy polarized protons can only be produced by accelerating
a beam from a polarized ion source. The highest energy reached so far was 25GeV in
the AGS and a lot of care had to be taken during acceleration to preserve this injected
polarization [1,3]. To explain depolarization in circular accelerators, some concepts from
spin dynamics have to be introduced. When a particle with charge q moves through a
magnetic ﬁeld, the motion of the classical spin vector in the instantaneous rest frame is
described by the Lorentz force equation and the Thomas-BMT equation [4,5],

where ~B⊥ and ~B⊥ are the magnetic ﬁeld components perpendicular and parallel to the
particle’s momentum ~p . At high energy where (Gγ + 1)/γ ≈ G, the spin motion is
independent of energy and a ﬁxed ﬁeld integral of 5.48Tm leads to a spin rotation of
180◦ , in contrast to the orbit deﬂection which varies with 1/γ. For ﬁxed orbit deﬂections
and thus ﬁxed ratio of ~B⊥/γ, the spin precession rate increases with energy as we now
describe.

In purely transverse magnetic ﬁelds, the Thomas-BMT equation has the same structure
as the Lorentz force equation up to a factor Gγ + 1 . The spin therefore rotates like the
momentum but with a magniﬁed rate. At the HERA energy of 920GeV, the magniﬁcation
factor is Gγ = 1756 so that the spin is rotated by 100◦ when a proton’s direction is
altered by 1mrad in a transverse magnetic ﬁeld and the spin rotates 1756 times around the
vertical while a particle makes one turn on the design orbit of a ﬂat circular accelerator,
where the ﬁelds are vertical. The number of spin rotations which a particle performs while
it travels along the closed orbit once is called the spin tune ν0 .

When the spin tune is integer, the spin comes back to a ﬁeld imperfection with the same
direction after one turn and the eﬀect of the ﬁeld error can add up coherently from turn
to turn. This resonant depolarization at integer spin tunes ν0 is called an imperfection
resonance [6].

When viewed at a ﬁxed azimuth θ of the accelerator, the particles appear to perform
harmonic oscillations around the closed orbit with the frequencies νx, νy, and ντ for
horizontal, vertical, and longitudinal motion. These are called the orbital tunes. Some
of the ﬁelds through which a particle propagates will therefore oscillate with the orbital
tunes. Whenever the non-integer part of the spin tune is equal to plus or minus one of
these frequencies, the resulting coherent perturbation can lead to depolarization. The
coherent depolarization at the ﬁrst order resonance condition ν0 = m + νk is called an
intrinsic resonance [6]. Here the notation ν1=νx, ν2=-νx, ν3=νy, ν4=-νy, ν5=ντ , ν6=-ντ
is used. Since the spin tune changes with energy (in a ﬂat ring ν0 = Gγ) resonances will
have to be crossed at some energies during acceleration.

After one turn around the accelerator, all spins of particles on the closed orbit have
been rotated by 2πν0 around a unit rotation vector ~n0 . This vector is determined by
the accelerator’s main guide ﬁelds and small ﬁeld imperfections only perturb ~n0 weakly
except at energies where the guide ﬁelds would produce an integer spin tune. Then, when
viewed from a ﬁxed azimuth, spins would come back after one turn apparently without
a rotation. Close to imperfection resonances the remaining rotation and therefore the
direction of ~n0 will be dominated by the inﬂuence of ﬁeld errors. While the energy changes
during acceleration, ~n0 changes its direction strongly at these resonances. Whenever this
change is suﬃciently slow, spins which are initially parallel to ~n0 will follow the change of
~n0 adiabatically. Imperfection resonances can therefore be crossed either by making the
ﬁeld imperfections small enough or by making them so strong that ~n0 already starts to
get inﬂuenced by the ﬁeld errors suﬃciently long before the resonance and then changes
slowly enough to let all spins follow adiabatically while the resonance is crossed. Special
magnets for enhancing this eﬀect without disturbing the orbit are referred to as partial
snakes. So far solenoid magnets have been used [7] but for the AGS a helical dipole partial
snake is under construction [3].

The motion of spins along phase space trajectories is dominated by the main guide ﬁelds
on the closed orbit except close to an intrinsic resonance, where the coherent perturbations
described above can dominate over the main guide ﬁelds. When the emittance of the beam
and therefore the amplitude of the perturbations is suﬃciently small, intrinsic resonances
can be crossed without loss of polarization. Polarization in the core of the beam will
therefore be only weakly inﬂuenced when crossing intrinsic resonances. If a strong coherent
perturbation is slowly switched on and oﬀ, an eﬀect similar to adiabatically following ~n0

3

occurs and polarization is conserved. Therefore, while an intrinsic resonance is crossed,
perturbations inﬂuencing particles in the tails of a beam will slowly increase already before
the resonance and this adiabatic conservation of polarization can occur. In intermediate
parts of the beam, however, the polarization is lost. This type of depolarization can be
overcome by slowly exciting the whole beam coherently at a frequency close to the orbital
tune which causes the perturbation. All spins then follow the adiabatic change of the
polarization direction and the resonance can be crossed with little loss of polarization.
The excitation amplitude is then reduced slowly so that the beam emittance does not
change noticeably during the whole process. This mechanism has recently been tested
successfully at the AGS [1]. An older technique of avoiding depolarization at strong
intrinsic resonances utilizes pulsed quadrupoles to move the orbital tune within a few
microseconds just before a resonance so that the resonance is crossed so quickly that the
spin motion is hardly disturbed [8].

So far no polarized beam has been accelerated to more than 25GeV [3]. But the pos-
sibility of polarized proton acceleration has been analyzed for RHIC (250GeV), for the
TEVATRON (900GeV), and for HERA (920GeV). When accelerating through approx-
imately 5000 resonances in the case of HERA, even very small depolarization in every
resonance crossing would add up to a detrimental eﬀect.

It was mentioned below equation (1) that in a ﬁxed transverse magnetic ﬁeld the deﬂec-
tion angle of high energy particles depends on energy, whereas the spin rotation does not
depend on energy. It is therefore possible to devise a ﬁxed ﬁeld magnetic device which ro-
tates spins by π whenever a high energy particle travels through it at the diﬀerent energies
of an acceleration cycle. Such ﬁeld arrangements which rotate spins by π while perturbing
the orbit only moderately are called Siberian Snakes [9]. The rotation axis is called the
snake axis and the angle of this axis to the beam direction is referred to as the snake angle
ψ . Let us consider a Siberian Snake with snake angle ψ1 at one point in a ﬂat ring and
a second Siberian Snake with snake angle ψ2 at the opposite side of the ring where the
spin has rotated by Gγ/2. The spin rotation around the vertical between the Siberian
Snakes is described with Pauli matrices by the quaternion cos(πGγ/2) + i sin(πGγ/2)σ2.
The rotation by the ﬁrst Siberian Snake is described by i[sin(ψ1)σ1 + cos(ψ1)σ3] . The
total rotation for one turn around the ring is then described by

i[sin(ψ1)σ1 + cos(ψ1)σ3] · [cos(πGγ/2) + i sin(πGγ/2)σ2]
· i[sin(ψ2)σ1 + cos(ψ2)σ3] · [cos(πGγ/2) + i sin(πGγ/2)σ2]

= i[sin(ψ1 + πGγ/2)σ1 + cos(ψ1 + πGγ/2)σ3]
· i[sin(ψ2 + πGγ/2)σ1 + cos(ψ2 + πGγ/2)σ3]

= − cos(ψ1 − ψ2) + i sin(ψ1 − ψ2)σ2 .
For ψ1 − ψ2 = π/2 the spins rotate in total 1/2 times around the vertical ~n0 during
a complete turn around the ring, giving ν0 = 1/2. All imperfection resonances and,
since the orbital tunes cannot be 1/2, also all ﬁrst order intrinsic resonances are avoided
by the insertion of these two Siberian Snakes, and polarized beam acceleration to very
high energy could become possible. Siberian Snakes can only be used at suﬃciently
high energies since their ﬁelds are not changed during acceleration of the beam and they
produce orbit distortions which are too big for energies below approximately 8GeV [10].

2. THE DESY ACCELERATOR CHAIN FOR POLARIZED PROTONS

For HERA a polarized proton beam would be produced by a polarized H− source. Then
it would be accelerated to 750keV in an RFQ and then to 50MeV in the LINAC III from
where it would be accelerated in the synchrotron DESY III to 7.5GeV/c. In the next
ring, PETRA, 40GeV/c are reached, and HERA ﬁnally accelerates to 920GeV/c. The
four main challenges for obtaining highly polarized beams in HERA are: (1) Production
of a 20mA pulsed H− beam. (2) Polarimetry at various stages in the acceleration chain.
(3) Acceleration through the complete accelerator chain with little depolarization. (4)
Storage of a polarized beam at the top energy over many hours with little depolarization.
Polarized protons are produced either by a polarized atomic beam source (ABS), where
a pulsed beam with 87% polarization for 1mA beam current has been achieved, or by an
optically pumped polarized ion source (OPPIS), where pulsed beams with 60% for 5mA
have been achieved. Experts claim that 80% polarization and 20mA could be achievable
with the second type of source. The current source at DESY produces 60mA but the
maximal current of 205mA in DESY III can already be achieved with a 20mA source.

Polarimeters will have to be installed at several crucial places in the accelerator chain.
The source would contain a Lyman-α polarimeter [11]. Another polarimeter could be
installed after the RFQ [12]. This could not be operated continuously since it disturbs
the beam. The transfer of polarized particles through the LINAC III could be optimized
with a polarimeter similar to that in the AGS LINAC; and like the AGS, DESY III could
contain an internal polarimeter [8]. Polarization at DESY III energies has been achieved
and measured at several labs already. It is diﬀerent with PETRA and HERA energies;
for these high energies there is no established polarimeter. Here one has to wait and see
how the novel techniques envisaged and developed for RHIC will work [13].

Since DESY III has a super period of eight, only 4 strong intrinsic ﬁrst order resonances
have to be crossed. They are at values for the spin tune Gγ of 8− νy, 0 + νy, 16− νy, and
8 + νy. Depolarization can be avoided by jumping the tune with pulsed quadrupoles in a
few microseconds or by excitation of a resonance with an RF dipole. A solenoid partial
snake would be used to cross the one strong imperfection resonance at Gγ = 8. All these
methods have been tested successfully at the AGS and it is likely that a highly polarized
proton beam could be extracted from the DESY III synchrotron at 7.5GeV/c .

In PETRA it would be very cumbersome to cross all resonances which can be seen
in ﬁgure 1 (middle). Since Siberian Snakes can be constructed for the injection energy
of PETRA [14] it will be best to avoid all ﬁrst order resonances with two such devices.
There is space for Siberian Snakes in the east and the west section of PETRA.

3. SPECIFIC PROBLEMS FOR THE HERA RING

HERA is a very complex accelerator and a brief look already indicates four reasons why
producing a polarized beam in HERA is more diﬃcult than in an ideal ring. (1) HERA has
a super periodicity of one and only an approximate mirror symmetry between the North
and South halves of the ring. Therefore more resonances appear than in a ring with some
higher super periodicity and special schemes for canceling resonances in symmetric lattices
[15] cannot be used in such a ring. (2) The proton ring of HERA is on top of the electron
ring in the arcs, and the proton beam is bent down to the level of the electron ring on

5

both sides of the three experiments H1, HERMES, and ZEUS in the North, East, and
South straight sections. The HERA proton accelerator is therefore not a ﬂat ring. The
destructive eﬀect of the vertical bends can, however, be eliminated by so called ﬂattening
snakes [16,17] which let the spin motion in pairs of vertical bends cancel and makes
~n0 vertical outside the non-ﬂat sections of HERA. (3) There is space for spin rotators
which make the polarization parallel to the beam direction inside the collider experiments
while keeping it vertical in the arcs, and there is also space for four Siberian Snakes.
But installing more than four Siberian Snakes would involve a lot of costly construction
work. Simulations have shown that 8 snakes with properly chosen snake angles would be
desirable. However, if one does not choose optimal snake angles, then four-snake-schemes
can be better than eight snake schemes [18]. (4) The energy is very high and therefore
the spin rotates rapidly. If HERA had been designed for polarized proton acceleration,
several parts of the ring would probably have been constructed diﬀerently.

4. APPLICABLE THEORY AND SIMULATION TOOLS

4.1. The isolated resonance model

In the isolated resonance model, the ﬁeld components which perturb the spin of a
particle that oscillates around the closed orbit are Fourier expanded. The perturbation of
spin motion is then approximated by dropping all except one of the Fourier components.
When ~z describes the phase space coordinates relative to the closed orbit and θ describes
the accelerator’s azimuth, the Thomas-BMT equation (1) has the form d~s/dθ = ~Ω(~z, θ)×~s.
The precession vector ~Ω can be written as ~Ω0(θ) + ~ω(~z, θ) with a part on the closed
orbit and a part which is linear in the phase space coordinates ~z. For spins parallel to
the rotation vector on the closed orbit ~n0(θ) only the components of ~ω(~z, θ) which are
perpendicular to ~n0 perturb the polarization. We now choose two mutually orthogonal
unit vectors ~m0 and ~l0 which are perpendicular to ~n0 and precess around ~Ω0 according to
the Thomas-BMT equation on the closed orbit. The frequency of their rotation is given
by the spin tune ν0.

In this model a depolarizing resonance occures when a Fourier component of ~ω(~z(θ), θ)
rotates with the same frequency as ~m0 and ~l0 so that there is a coherent perturbation of
the spins away from ~n0. The Fourier component ǫν0 for this frequency is obtained from
the Fourier integral along a trajectory ~z(θ),

ǫν0 = lim
N→∞

1

2πN Z 2πN

0

~ω(~z(θ), θ) · ( ~m0 + i~l0)dθ .

(3)

These resonance strengths are shown in the ﬁgure 1 (top), (middle), and (bottom) for the
three proton synchrotrons at DESY. They were all computed for an oscillation amplitude
of ~z(θ) corresponding to the one sigma vertical emittance of 4πmm mrad.

4.2. The invariant spin ﬁeld

Already at extraction from PETRA the polarized beam would have somewhat more
energy than any other polarized proton beam so far obtained and one has to ask whether
the isolated resonance model successfully used so far for describing depolarization is still
applicable. To understand whether the isolated resonance model describes spin motion
at HERA accurately, we introduce the invariant spin ﬁeld of a circular accelerator. It has

6

been mentioned that a particle on the closed orbit has to be polarized parallel to ~n0 in
order to have the same polarization after every turn. Similarly, one can ask if the whole
ﬁeld of spin directions for particles at diﬀerent phase space points can be invariant from
turn to turn.

Each particle can have a diﬀerent spin direction at its phase space point ~z and each
of these spins propagates with a diﬀerent precession vector ~Ω(~z(θ), θ) in the Thomas-
BMT equation. A spin ﬁeld ~n(~z) which is invariant after one turn around the ring is
called an invariant spin ﬁeld or a Derbenev–Kontratenko ~n-axis [9]. A beam which is
polarized parallel to this invariant spin ﬁeld at every phase space point does not change
its polarization state from turn to turn. Particles change their location in phase space
from some initial phase space coordinate ~zi in the Poincar´e section at azimuth θ to some
ﬁnal coordinate after one turn ~zf = ~M (~zi) according to the one turn map. And spins
change their directions according to the one turn spin transport matrix R(~zi), but the
invariant ﬁeld of spin directions ~n(~zi) does not change after one turn. This requirement
is encompassed by the periodicity condition

~n( ~M(~zi)) = R(~zi)~n(~zi) .

(4)

Note that the polarization state of a particle beam is in general not invariant from turn to
turn when all particles are initially completely polarized parallel to each other, but rather
when each particle is polarized parallel to ~n(~z) at its phase space point ~z. In this case
the polarization of a particle will be parallel to ~n(~zi) whenever it comes close to its initial
phase space point ~zi during later turns around the ring, as long as ~n(~z) is suﬃciently
continuous. When two particles travel along the same trajectory, the angle between their
two spins does not change. When a particle is initially polarized with an angle φ to ~n(~z),
it will therefore be rotated around ~n(~z) every time it comes close to ~zi, but it will still have
the angle φ to the invariant spin ﬁeld. The time averaged polarization at ~zi will therefore
be parallel to ~n(~zi), but it can only have the magnitude 1 if the spin was initially parallel
to the invariant spin ﬁeld. However, even if all particles are initially polarized parallel to
~n(~z), the beam polarization is not 1 but < ~n > where < . . . > denotes an average over the
beam. The maximum average polarization that can be stored in an accelerator at a given
ﬁxed energy is therefore | < ~n > |. It was ﬁrst pointed out in [19] that this maximum
polarization can be small in HERA.
Since the spin dynamics depends on energy, the invariant spin ﬁeld ~n(~z) will change
during the acceleration process. If this change is slow enough, spins which are parallel
to ~n(~z) will follow adiabatically. However, if the change is too rapid, polarization will be
lost. It is therefore good to have < ~n > close to 1 not only at the collider energy but
during the complete acceleration cycle. Four problems occur when the diﬀerent directions
of ~n(~z) are not close to parallel for all particles in the beam. (1) Sudden changes of ~n(~z)
reduces the polarization. (2) The average polarization available to the collider experiment
is reduced. (3) The polarization involved in each collision process depends on the phase
space position of the interacting particles. (4) Measuring the polarization in the tail of
the beam will not give accurate information on the average polarization of the beam.

4.2.1. Linearized spin orbit motion

At azimuth θ, a spin can be described by a usually small complex coordinate α with

~s = ℜ{α} ~m0(θ)+ℑ{α}~l0(θ)+q1 − |α|2~n0(θ). When the spin coordinates α and the phase
space coordinates are linearized, one approximates an initial spin by ~si ≈ ℜ{αi} ~m0(0) +
ℑ{αi}~l0(0) + ~n0(0) at azimuth 0 and the ﬁnal spin after one turn around the accelerator
by ~sf = ℜ{αf} ~m0(0) + ℑ{αf}~l0(0) + ~n0(0) where αf is determined by the 7 × 7 one turn
transport matrix M 77,

αi! =   M ~0

αi! ,

~GT ei2πν0! ~zi

αf! = M 77 ~zi
 ~zf
whereby M is the 6×6 dimensional one turn transport matrix for the phase space variables,
the exponential describes the rotation of the spin components α by the spin tune ν0 around
~n0, the row vector ~GT describes the dependence of spin motion on phase space motion
to ﬁrst order, and the 6 dimensional zero vector ~0 shows that the eﬀect of Stern Gerlach
forces on the orbit motion is not considered.

(5)

We now write the components perpendicular to ~n0 of the invariant spin ﬁeld as a com-
plex function nα(~z) and use a 7 dimensional vector ~n1 to obtain the ﬁrst order expansion
of ~n(~z). The linearized periodicity condition for the invariant spin ﬁeld is

~n1(~z) =   ~z

nα(~z)! , ~n1(M~z) = M 77~n1(~z) .

(6)

This equation can be solved for ~n1 after the matrices are diagonalized. Let A−1 be the
column matrix of eigenvectors of the one turn matrix M . The diagonalized matrix of
orbit motion Λ = A M A−1 has the diagonal elements exp(i2πνk) given by the orbital
tunes ν1 = νx, ν2 = −νx, etc. We now need the 7 × 6 dimensional matrix T which is the
column matrix of the ﬁrst 6 eigenvectors of M 77 and has the form

~BT ! , T Λ = M 77T ,

T =  A−1
where the 7th components of the eigenvectors form a vector ~B. If a linear function ~n1(~z) =
K~z of the phase space coordinates can be found, which satisﬁes the periodicity condition
(6), then an invariant spin ﬁeld has been determined. Inserting the form ~z1 = K~z into
equation (6) and multiplying the resulting condition K M = M 77K by A−1 from the
right leads to K A−1Λ = M 77KA−1 . Therefore K A−1 is the 7× 6 dimensional matrix of
eigenvectors T satisfying equation (7) and we conclude that there exists a unique linear
invariant spin ﬁeld given by

(7)

~n1(~z) = T A~z .

(8)

In the linear approximation of spin motion, the invariant spin ﬁeld is simply computed
via the eigenvectors of the 7 × 7 spin orbit transport matrix. This matrix M 77 can
be computed in various ways, for example by multiplying the individual spin transport
matrixes of all elements [20] or by concatenating spin transport quaternions of individual
elements as done in the program SPRINT [21]. In the normal form space belonging to

8

the diagonal matrix Λ the coordinates are given by the actions Jj and the angle variables
Φj with

A~z =  

√J1eiΦ1
√J1e−iΦ1

. . . ! .

(9)

The average over all angle variables of a phase space torus then leads to the average
opening angle of

< φ(~n, ~n0) >≈ atan(q< |nα|2 >) = atan(vuut
Xk=1

3

(|B2k−1|2 + |B2k|2)Jk) ,

(10)

where the Bk are the 7th components of the eigenvectors in equation (7).

These opening angles are shown for DESY III in ﬁgure 2 (top) and it is apparent that at
the places where resonant spin perturbations are described by a large resonance strength,
the invariant spin ﬁeld has a large opening angle.
It is obvious when comparing with
the resonance strength of ﬁgure 1 (top) that the inﬂuence of diﬀerent resonances does
not overlap in the linearized spin approximation. At PETRA energies of up to 40GeV,
the resonances already come very close to each other as seen when comparing ﬁgure
2 (middle) with ﬁgure 1 (middle) and one can only barely expect an isolated resonance
approximation to lead to accurate results. For high energies between 780 and 820GeV/c
in HERA, ﬁgure 2 (bottom) clearly shows that one cannot speak of isolated resonances.
Often the inﬂuences of 4 resonances overlap.

The approximation of linearized spin motion contains all ﬁrst order orbital frequencies,
since it linearized the precession vector ~Ω with respect to ~z. However, in contrast to the
isolated resonance model, none of these resonances is ignored and the eﬀect of overlapping
resonances can be seen.

It is possible to recover the ﬁrst order isolated resonance strength from the one turn
spin orbit transport matrix. In analogy to the complex notation for the spin component
perpendicular to ~n0, the perturbing precession vector ~ω is expressed by a complex function
ω(~z, ~θ) as ~ω = ℜ{ω} ~m0 + ℑ{ω}~l0 + (~ω · ~n0)~n0.
Inserting this into the Thomas-BMT
equation, one obtains
α′ = −i√1 − ~α2ω + iα(~ω · ~n0) .
spin which was initially parallel to ~n0 one obtains α(θ) ≈ −iR θ
equation (3) one can express the resonance strength as ǫν0 = i limN→∞
resonance strength can therefore be computed from M N
becomes very eﬃcient if one uses M 2N

In the case of spins which are nearly parallel to ~n0, one can linearize in α and ~z. For a

The coordinate vectors ~m0(2π) and ~l0(2π) to which α(2π) refers have rotated by the spin
tune ν0, whereas the ﬁnal spin coordinate αf computed by M 77 refers to the coordinate
vectors ~m0(0) and ~l0(0). Therefore α(2πN) = αf exp(−i2πNν0), and ǫν0 can be computed

The 1 in the diagonal matrix is in position k. Here A−1(0...√JkeiΦk...0)T is the initial
value for a phase space trajectory which has only Fourier components with frequencies νk
plus integers and the kth eigenvector ~vk of M has been used. The inﬁnite Fourier integral
in equation (3) has been reduced to the scalar product between the bottom vector of M 77
and an eigenvector of M . This very simple formula is used in the program SPRINT.

4.3. Non-perturbative methods

While one does not drop Fourier coeﬃcients in the approximation of linearized spin
motion, there are other limitations. The approximation is no longer justiﬁed when |nα|
becomes large, which happens close to resonances in the ﬁgures 2. Therefore the validity
of linearized spin motion had to be be checked by computing the invariant spin ﬁeld non-
perturbatively. In the last few years two iterative higher order and three non-perturbative
methods of computing the invariant spin ﬁeld have been developed [22]. All of these meth-
ods agree within their ranges of mutual applicability. The invariant spin ﬁeld obtained
from a non-perturbative method contains the eﬀect of all Fourier coeﬃcients in ~Ω. When
comparing this spin ﬁeld with ~n1, it was found that linearized orbit motion describes the
opening angle and thus the maximum storeable polarization well in domains where the
opening angle is small. At the critical energies, where the maximum polarization is low
during the acceleration process, non-perturbative methods become essential for simulation
and results obtained with the computationally quick linearization of spin motion should
always be checked with more time consuming non-perturbative methods if possible.

One application of this strategy is the ﬁltering method [23]. Four or eight Siberian
Snakes are inserted into HERA to ﬁx the spin tune to 1/2 for all energies and to let ~n0 be
vertical in the ﬂat arcs. These conditions do not ﬁx all snake angles. Currently there is,
however, no established formula to determine good snake angles. Since the opening angle
of ~n(~z) is such a critical quantity for high energy polarized proton acceleration, we have
decided to maximize < ~n > by choosing snake angles. A computer code was written which
tested approximately 106 snake schemes and computational speed was therefore essential.
Linearized spin motion was used to ﬁnd the 8-snake-schemes with smallest average value
of |nα| over the acceleration cycle. These ﬁltered snake schemes then also had relatively
small opening angles when computed non-perturbatively with stroboscopic averaging [21].
Two other indications showed that this ﬁltering leads to good snake schemes. (1) Track-
ing simulations of the complete ramp process showed that the snake schemes found by
ﬁltering leads to less depolarization [24] than other schemes which were initially proposed.
(2) Computation of the amplitude dependent spin tune, which can only be performed when

10

~n(~z) has been found non-perturbatively, shows that snakes schemes found by ﬁltering have
signiﬁcantly less spin tune spread over orbital amplitudes than other proposed schemes
[25]. With the optimal scheme for four Siberian Snakes in HERA it turned out to be
possible to accelerate in computer simulations approximately 65% of the beam to high
energy with little loss of polarization as long as no closed orbit distortions were present
[18]. In simulations, the current 1mm rms closed orbit distortions lead to depolarization
[26]. Therefore either the closed orbit will have to be controlled more accurately or tech-
niques which make the spin motion less sensitive to closed orbit distortion [27] will have
to be utilized.

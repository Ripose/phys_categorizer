We suggest a new type of radiation (acoustically induced radiation – AIR), which is generated
by ultrarelativistic particles channeling in crystal along a crystal plane (or axis), which is bent by
a transverse acoustic wave. The AIR mechanism allows to make an undulator with characteristics
inaccessible in the undulators based on the motion of particles in the periodic magnetic ﬁelds and
also in the ﬁeld of the laser radiation. The intensity of AIR can easily be made larger than the
intensity of the radiation in a linear crystal and can be varied in a wide range by varying the
frequency and the amplitude of the acoustic wave.

We suggest the new type of the undulator radiation (acoustically induced radiation – AIR), which is generated
by the ultrarelativistic charged particle channeled in a crystal along a crystal axis or a crystal plane, which is bent
by a transverse acoustic wave (AW). In this letter we consider channeling of a positron along the plane bent by the
transverse monochromatic standing AW of the frequency withinin 1 − 102 MHz range. Due to bending of the crystal
planes caused by the AW, the beam of channeled positrons penetrating through the channel oscillates in the transverse
direction as illustrated in ﬁgure 1. Transverse oscillations of positrons caused by the AW become the eﬀective source
of radiation of undulator type due to the constructive interference of the photons emitted from the similar parts of
the trajectory. As we demonstrate below, the number of oscillations can vary in a wide range from few up to few
hundreds oscillations per cm depending on the chosen parameters.

In addition to AIR, channeled positrons emit ordinary channeling radiation [1] due to their transverse motion
inside the channel. However, the frequency of these oscillations is much higher than the frequency of the transverse
oscillations caused by the AW (see the estimates below). Therefore, two motions are well separated, and the AIR
mechanism can be treated independently from the ordinary channeling radiation. A similar situation occurs in a
one-arc bent crystal, where channeled charged particles generate additional synchrotron type radiation due to the
curvature of the channel [2,8]. This component of the total radiation intensity leads to the undulator eﬀect in the
channel periodically bent by AW. We demonstrate that the intensity of AIR can be made larger than the ordinary
channeling radiation. The important feature of the AIR consists in the possibility to vary signiﬁcantly the intensity
and the shape of the spectral distribution of AIR by varying the frequency and the amplitude of AW. The suggested
mechanism of AIR allows to make an undulator with the parameters N and p varying in a wide range (where N is

1

the number of periods of the undulator and p is the undulator constant) which is inaccessible in the undulators based
on the motion of charged particles in the periodic magnetic ﬁelds and also in the ﬁeld of the laser radiation [3]. In
the suggested scheme, AIR is generated by the relativistic charged particles, with relativistic factors γ = ε/mc2 in the
range γ = 1 − 107 and above (c is the velocity of light, m is the mass of the particle). The large range of γ available
in the modern colliders at present or in nearest future for various charged particles, both light and heavy, together
with the wide range of frequencies and the amplitudes possible for AW in crystals allows to generate the AIR photons
with the energies up to the TeV region.

The phenomenon, which we consider in the present paper, is an example of the charged particle channeling in a
bent crystal. The process of channeling of the charged particles in a bent crystal is presently of great current interest
(see e.g. [4,5]), because of its possible practical applications for the manipulation of charged particle beams of high
energy. In these papers, both theoretical and experimental, bent crystals were assumed or used as specially prepared
or grown. Here we suggest completely diﬀerent way of bending the crystal based on the use of the acoustic waves.
It is important to note that the condition for channeling in a bent crystal (see e.g. [2,5]) can be fulﬁlled in this case
too. As a result, motion of particle in the ﬁeld of the channel bent by the transverse AW becomes periodic and thus
acquires essential features of the motion of the particle in the periodic magnetic ﬁeld. However, parameters of particle
trajectory, such as the amplitude or the oscillation period, are not accessible in magnetic ﬁelds available at present in
laboratory conditions.

Now let us analyze the conditions which must be fulﬁlled when considering the bent crystal as an undulator.
Consider an ultra-relativistic particle (of mass m, charge q > 0, energy ε, relativistic factor γ ≫ 1, v ≈ c) channeling
near a crystallographic plane. Extension to the case of axial channeling of electrons is rather straightforward. Let
the transverse monochromatic AW be transmitted along the direction of projectile’s motion, and let vt, ν, λ = vt/ν,
a be the AW phase velocity, the frequency, the wave length and the wave amplitude, respectively. Under the action
of AW the planar channel, linear initially, will be bent.

Bending of a channel by the AW becomes signiﬁcant if the AW amplitude becomes larger than the interplanar
distance, d, d ≪ a. In this letter we analyze the case when the shape of the channel does not vary much during the
time of ﬂight, τ = L/c, of the particle through the crystal of the thickness L, i.e. τ is much smaller than the AW
period T : τ ≪ T . The channeling process in a bent crystal takes place if the maximal centrifugal force in the channel,
mγv2/Rmin (where Rmin is a minimum curvature radius of the bent channel) is less the force caused by the maximal
interplanar ﬁeld U ′

max [2,5]:

mγv2/Rmin < q U

′
max.

Provided (1) is fulﬁlled, the projectile, which enters the crystal under the angle θ much less than the critical angle θL,
will move, being trapped in the channel, along the trajectory, which represents the instant shape of the accoustically
bent channel (see ﬁgure 1):

The frequency of the transverse oscillatory motion of a positron moving along the trajectory (2), 2πc/λ, is much
2Umax/mγ/d [1], provided condition (1)
smaller than the frequency of the oscillatory motion inside the channel, 2π
is fulﬁlled and if a ≫ d. The frequencies of the two types of motions are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent so that they can be
treated independently.

p

The minimum curvature radius of the trajectory (2) is equal to Rmin = (λ/2π)2/a. Thus, decreasing λ and
increasing a, we decrease Rmin and increase the maximum acceleration of the particle in the channel. As a result,
photon emission due to the projectile’s acceleration in the bent channel may be signiﬁcantly enhanced. Below we
demonstrate that this radiation, which is emitted coherently from similar parts of the trajectory, may dominate
considerably over the radiation caused by the acceleration of the particle in the linear channel.

For the trajectory (2) the relation (1) reads as

vt
2π (cid:17)
and determines ranges of ν, a and γ for which the channeling process as well as the undulator radiation, can occur for
given crystal and crystallographic plane (the parameters U ′
max and vt are subject to the choice of a particular crystal
and a plane) and for given projectile type, characterized by a rest mass and a charge.

Both the motion of the projectile in the bent channel and the spectrum of the generated electromagnetic radiation
are of the undulator-type, only if λ ≪ L, i.e. if the channeling particle oscillates many times within the length L of
the crystal. The suggested undulator, ’AW + channeling particle’, is characterized as any other undulator [3] by the
frequency, ω0 = 2π c/λ, and the undulator parameter, p = 2πγ a/λ.

Figs. 2–3 illustrate the ranges of ν and a in which the channeling process for a positron and a proton in a carbon
crystal is possible. The cases 2 and 3 correspond to the energies 50 and 500 GeV . The solid thick line in both ﬁgures
represents the boundary ν2 a = C (see (3)). In each ﬁgure the range of validity of (3) lies below this line. Dotted
and dashed-dotted lines indicate the constant values of the undulator parameter p for a positron and a proton. The
dashed lines correspond the constant values of the number of the AW periods per 1 cm: N (cm−1) = λ−1. All data
presented in Figs. 2–3 and subsequently refer to a projectile channeling near the (110) crystallographic plane. We use

FIG. 3. Same as for Fig. 2 but for 500 GeV projectiles

Figs. 2–3 demonstrate that the parameters p and N vary in wide ranges: N = 1...100, p = 0.1 − 500 for projectile
positron and p = 0.001 − 0.1 for a proton. These values are by more than an order of magnitude larger than those
accessible in the undulators based on the motion of the charged particles either in periodic magnetic ﬁelds or in the
ﬁeld of the laser radiation [3].

In the limit N, p ≫ 1 one can calculate the spectral intensity of radiation (per 1 cm) emitted by a projectile positron
moving along the path (2), by utilizing the following formula deduced from general expression, given in [7], which has
been obtained within the framework of quasi-classical approximation:

Using (4)–(5), we have calculated the spectral distributions of AIR at diﬀerent parameters. The spectral distribu-
tions (per cm) of the radiation emitted by a 50 and 500 GeV positron moving along the trajectory (2) in carbon and
tungsten crystals are plotted for various values of the undulator parameter p and the amplitude a in Figs. 4–5. These
ﬁgures demonstrate that for a ﬁxed frequency ν the intensity of radiation can be varied in a wide range by altering the
AW amplitude, which is proportional to the value of the undulator parameter p. These ﬁgures illustrate as well the
dependence of the spectral distributions on the energy of the particle. Comparison of the spectra presented in Figs.
4–5 with those in the case of channeling in the corresponding linear crystal [1] shows that the intensity of AIR can be
made much larger than the corresponding intensity of radiation in the linear crystal case by choosing the appropriate
AW parameters.

Finally, let us estimate the stability of the suggested undulator. From general theory of undulators one can deduce
[1] that the relative deviation of the undulator resonance frequency ∆ω/ω is proportional to the relative variation of
the undulator parameters, in our case to ∆a/a and ∆λ/λ. For the resonant undulator frequencies and the parameters
considered above, the ratio ∆ω/ω ∼ 0.1. This means that the ﬂuctuation of a and λ in the AW on the level of 10%
or less does not inﬂuence much the stabilty of the suggested undulator even in the region of very high frequencies.
Note that the relative variation of the AW amplitude during the time of ﬂight of the positron through the crystal is
much lower, ∆a/a ∼ νL/c ∼ 1/300 at ν ∼ 100M Hz and L ∼ 1cm.

Our investigation shows that the described phenomenon can be used for the construction of an undulator with
variable parameters for the generation of high energy photons in a wide range. We have discussed the plane channeling
of positrons combined with one of the most simple examples of AW. However, other cases of AW (longitudinal waves,
spherical waves, non-monochromatic waves and various combinations thereof), interacting with the beam of the
channeled particles (positrons, electrons, heavy ions) as well as the case of axial channeling of electrons are worthy to
study. Another interesting question, being raised by our work, is the possibility of the stimulated photon emission in
the undulator described above (free electron laser type). Such work is in progress.

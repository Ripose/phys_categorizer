The current status of the 2mrad crossing angle layout for the ILC is reviewed. The scheme developed in the UK and
France is described and the performance discussed for a TeV machine. Secondly, the scheme developed at SLAC and
BNL is then studied and modiﬁed for a TeV machine. We ﬁnd that both schemes can handle the higher energy beam
with modiﬁcations, and share many common features.

1. INTRODUCTION

In this article, we describe the recent development of the 2mrad horizontal crossing angle scheme for the ILC.
To date, two parallel designs have emerged: the ﬁrst coming from the UK and France and the second from SLAC
and BNL. We shall describe both schemes here, although they share many common features and are now being
developed in parallel under the uniﬁed SLAC-BNL-UK-France task force collaboration. The work presented focuses
on the performance at 1 TeV. The beneﬁts of the scheme are well documented [1]: for small crossing angles, the
loss of luminosity is small (crab correction may not be necessary and it may be possible to partially correct this loss
by exploiting the ﬁnite η′ at the IP for local chromaticity correction lattices), no electrostatic separators or kicker
magnets are needed and the conditions are improved for physics (e.g. better forward coverage). A known weakness
of this scheme is however its more diﬃcult conditions for extracting cleanly the spent disrupted and energy-degraded
beam, in comparison with larger crossing-angle schemes where separate magnetic channels can be used for in-and
outgoing beams.

The work presented here covers the designs developed at SLAC, BNL, the UK and France. In section 2 we shall
describe the scheme developed in Europe and discuss its performance at 1 TeV. In section 3, we shall discuss the
performance of the SLAC/BNL scheme, when extended to 1 TeV from the initial design at 500 GeV, and we shall
draw our conclusions in section 4.

2. The UK/FRANCE EXTRACTION LINE DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE AT 1 TEV

In this section we shall describe the 2mrad interaction region layout and extraction line for the 2mrad horizontal

crossing angle scheme.

The ﬁnal doublet magnets have been optimised for the extraction of a 500 GeV beam. A similar optimisation exists
for the baseline beam energy of 250 GeV. It has been shown that the doublet parameters calculated for a high energy
beam also provide acceptable extraction at lower energy. The superconducting magnet closest to the IP, denoted

Figure 1: The power losses into QD, as a function of crossing angle. The left-hand plot is for the case of a TeV machine
with 2×1010 bunch population and the right-hand plot is a TeV machine with the vertical oﬀset of 150nm at the IP. In both
cases the blue line (the lower curve at small angle) denotes the power loss with the beam size eﬀect turned on and the red
line (the upper curve at small angle) denotes the power loss with the beam size eﬀect turned oﬀ. Note that for the right-hand
plot, both curves have the vertical oﬀset.

QD, is of critical importance to the IR layout properties and is chosen to be a LHC low-β-insertion quadrupole.
This provides the required aperture and ﬁeld strength to accommodate both the incoming and outgoing (disrupted)
beams. Note that the outgoing beam possesses a long low energy tail and, by virtue of the crossing angle, is oﬀ-axis
in QD. The other ﬁnal doublet magnet, QF, is constructed from a normal conducting magnet and is separated from
QD by 3m. For the TeV machine, QD and QF are 2.3m and 1.9m long, respectively. After passing through QD, the
outgoing disrupted beam enters the extraction line, which provides beam transport to the dump and downstream
diagnostics (the geometry is ﬁxed by the linear matrix element R22 from the IP to the exit of QD).

The LHC low-β-region quadrupoles are constructed from NbTi and can achieve a gradient of 215 Tm−1 with an
available aperture for the beam of 62mm. Note that higher gradients are currently under development, which will aid
the present application. LHC studies of the tolerable power depostion indicate local and integral values of 0.4 mWg−1
and 5 Wm−1 respectively; this approximately translates into a maximum power deposition from charged particles
into QD of around 10W.

Note that in all these studies, unless otherwise noted, we assume the parameters of the TeV ILC parameters working
group and, where possible, assume the worst possible parameter set for extraction. In this work, we follow [2] and
assume a photon cone half-opening angle of 0.5mrad in all cases. This ensures that the cone contains all the photon
power, apart from 100W. This remaining power needs to be lost in suitable collimators. Ensuring extraction of the
photons past QF immediately requires a crossing angle of greater than 1.6mrad.

Figure 1 shows the power deposition into QD from charged particles produced during the beam-beam interaction,
as a function of crossing angle. These power deposition calculations are described in detail in [3]. The charged particle
loss comes from two sources: the low energy tail of the disrupted beam and from radiative Bhabha events produced
in the interaction of colliding particles (also refered to as the “Compton tail”). The latter contribution is suppressed
in regions of phase space of low transverse momentum exchange, where the virtual photons participating in the
scattering process can have a transverse position indeterminacy exceeding the transverse beam size. The suppression
from this so-called beam-size eﬀect is illustrated in the curves of ﬁg. 1. Conservatively, the results without it are
however used for the worst-case scenarios considered here.
If we assume a maximun power loss of 10W, we ﬁnd
that for the case of a TeV machine with a bunch population of 2×1010, we can tolerate a crossing angle no larger
than 1.6mrad. This result is dominated by the Compton tail. The other case we have considered in ﬁgure 1 shows
a larger permitted crossing angle, and hence easier extraction. This case, with a vertical oﬀset of 150nm at the IP,
is studied because it maximises the low energy tail of the disrupted beam. For further details of these calculations
see [3]. All of these curves were produced using the US cold machine parameters, for which the key parameters (for
this study) are similar to the WG 1 new ILC nominal parameters [4].

The purpose of the extraction line is to transport the disrupted beam to the dump with controlled and acceptable
losses, handle the undisrupted beam in the case of single beam operation (e.g. during commissioning) and to provide

diagnostics on the disrupted beam. The possible diagnostics include Compton polarimetry and energy spectrometry.
The linear dispersion for the extraction line is shown in the left-hand plot of ﬁgure 2. The linear dispersion allows
identiﬁcation of the major optical structures, denoted by regions of non-zero dispersion. The ﬁrst region is the
dispersion generated by the beam being oﬀ-axis in QD (the ﬁrst magnet in the line). This dispersion is cancelled by a
mirroring dipole. The second dispersive region is a “bend-back” linear-achromatic structure, which bends the beam
parallel to the beam at the IP. This is necessary to perform Compton polarimeter and “undo” the spin precession
occuring in upstream dipoles. The third region is the diagnostic chicane; the current requirements for this chicane
is a secondary beam focus and some dispersion, such that the dispersive beam size dominates the betatron beam
size. Requirements of beamsize/laser wavelength correlation and of minimum background requirements are under
study. The ﬁrst magnet in the extraction line is of critical importance, due to the need to place the ﬁrst disrupted
beam magnet as close as possible to the IP, balanced against the constraints of transverse space. For this reason,
a half-quadrupole current sheet magnet is used [5]. These magnets, developed for the TESLA extraction line [5]
provide the required aperture and maximum pole tip ﬁeld whilst allowing the magnet to be placed 8m after the exit
of QD (with 50mm transverse separation). Note that other magnet designs are under study.

The right-hand plot of ﬁgure 2 shows the optimisation of the apertures for a ﬁxed power loss. We have used the
TeV machine nominal parameters and demanded a power loss of 0.5ppm at each element. We also considered a
vertical oﬀset of 120nm. The apertures were calculated using explicit all-orders ray-tracing of the disrupted beam.
The calculated apertures are acceptable, although the very downstream apertures for the TeV machine need some
optimisation.

The study of this scheme is on-going. It is necessary to include the eﬀects on the outgoing beam of all the ﬁelds
from nearby magnets used to focus the incoming beam, in particular QF. This can be done by way of suitable
multipole expansions, once the detailed ﬁeld map is computed.
It has been shown to be particularly critical to
predict reliably the transport of the low-energy tail of the extracted beam [6]. Furthermore the magnet technology
is of prime importance, and substitutes for the half-quadrupole described here are under consideration, along with
the use of sextupoles in the extraction line to aid the control of the low energy beam tail. The layout of the charged
particle and photon beam dumps is also a topic for further work, along with detailed calculations of backgrounds in
the detector and diagnostic sections.

3. The SLAC-DEVELOPED DESIGN EXTENDED TO 1 TEV

In this section, we describe the performance of the SLAC/BNL-designed 2 mrad scheme, when extended to the
upgrade centre-of-mass energy of 1 TeV. This scheme, described in [6], was studied at 1 TeV using the nominal
parameters and a vertical oﬀset of 100nm. This gives a low energy Beamstrahlung tail reaching down to 18%
of maximum energy, when computed with high statistics. Extending the design to 1 TeV required a number of

modiﬁcations to the initial design for 500 GeV: proper scaling of the lengths of sextupoles to keep the pole tips
within maximum achievable ﬁelds, increasing L* from 3.51m to 4.1m and reducing the length of QD0 to reduce over
focusing of low energy tail particles. In order to reduce the losses of the low energy tail particles on the magnets, a
collimator was introduced in the vertical plane within the ﬁnal doublet. The horizontal and vertical beam envelopes
for this scheme are shown in ﬁgure 3, for particles in diﬀerent energy ranges. Note that this is a ﬁrst look at the TeV
upgrade of this scheme and further optimisation and power losses on the magnets needs to be evaluated.

4. CONCLUSION

We have described the 2mrad horizontal crossing angle schemes under development for the ILC. The ﬁrst part
described the scheme developed in the UK and France, and focused on its propeties at 1 TeV. The second describes
the study of the SLAC and BNL scheme from these proceedings, when extending the design to 1 TeV. Both schemes
at 1 TeV can work with nominal parameters but the high luminosity case seems diﬃcult. Further development work
is ongoing. Finally we note that both schemes share many common features.

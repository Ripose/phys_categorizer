Analytical Estimation of the Beam-Beam
Interaction Limited Dynamic Apertures
and Lifetimes in e+e− Circular Colliders

Abstract

Physically speaking, the delta function like beam-beam nonlinear
forces at interaction points (IPs) act as a sum of delta function nonlin-
ear multipoles. By applying the general theory established in ref. [1],
in this paper we investigate analytically the beam-beam interaction
limited dynamic apertures and the corresponding beam lifetimes for
both the round and the ﬂat beams. Relations between the beam-beam
limited beam lifetimes and the beam-beam tune shifts are established,
which show clearly why experimentally one has always a maximum
beam-beam tune shift, ξy,max, around 0.045 for e+e− circular colliders,
and why one can use round beams to double this value approximately.
Comparisons with some machine parameters are given. Finally, we
discuss the mechanism of the luminosity reduction due to a deﬁnite
collision crossing angle.

1 Introduction

Beam-beam interactions in circular colliders have many inﬂuences on the
performance of the machines, and the most important eﬀect is that beam-
beam interactions contribute to the limitations on dynamic apertures and
beam lifetimes. Due to the importance of this subject, enormous eﬀorts

1

have been made to calculate incoherent and coherent beam-beam forces, to
simulate beam-beam eﬀects, to ﬁnd the diﬀerence between ﬂat and round
colliding beams, and to establish analytical formulae to estimate the maxi-
mum beam-beam tune shift [2]-[20]. Physically speaking, the delta function
like beam-beam nonlinear forces at interaction points (IPs) act as a sum of
delta function nonlinear multipoles. In ref.
[1] we have established a gen-
eral theory to study analytically in detail the delta function multipoles and
their combined eﬀects on the dynamic apertures in circular storage rings, and
in this paper we will apply these general analytical formulae to the case of
beam-beam interactions and ﬁnd the corresponding beam dynamic apertures
and beam lifetimes. We will show quantitatively why there exists a maximum
beam-beam tune shift, ξy,max, around 0.045 for ﬂat beams in e+e− circular
colliders, and why this number can be almost doubled for round colliding

beams. Applications to some machine parameters are also given.
paper we will restrict ourselves to the discussion of e+e− circular colliders
since the treatment for the hadron colliders will be somewhat diﬀerent and
more diﬃcult. Finally, we discuss beam-beam eﬀects with a deﬁnite crossing
angle.

2 Beam-beam interactions

For two head-on colliding bunches, the incoherent kick felt by each particle
can be calculated as [13]:

−

f (x, y, σx, σy)

δy′ + iδx′ =

γ∗
where x′ and y′ are the horizontal and vertical slopes, Ne is the particle pop-
10−15 m), σx
ulation in the bunch, re is the electron classical radius (2.818
and σy are the standard deviations of the transverse charge density distri-
bution of the counter-rotating bunch at IP, γ∗ is the normalized particle’s
energy, and
denotes the test particle and the bunch to which the test par-
ticle belongs. When the bunch is Gaussian f (x, y, σx, σy) can be expressed
by Basseti-Erskine formula [10]:

where r = √x2 + y2. Now we want to calculate the average kick felt by the
test particle since the probability to ﬁnd the transverse displacement of the
test particle is not constant (in fact, the probability function is the same as
the charge distribution of the bunch to which the test particle belongs in
lepton machines due to synchrotron radiations). In the following we assume
that the transverse sizes for the two colliding bunches at IP are exactly the
same. For the round beam case after averaging one gets[4][14]:

δ¯r′ =

2Nere

exp

−

γ∗¯r

 −

4σ2 !!

(RB)

(7)

Although this expression is the same as that of the coherent beam-beam kick
for round beams, one should keep in mind that we are not ﬁnding coherent
beam-beam kick originally, and the diﬀerence will be obvious when we treat
the vertical motion in the case of ﬂat beams. For the ﬂat beam case, we will
treat the horizontal and vertical planes separately. As far as the horizon-
tal kick is concerned, the horizontal kick depends only on one displacement
variable just similar to the round beam case, we will use its coherent form
expressed as follows [12][14]:

δx′ =

where σx in the incoherent formula in ref.
[12] has been replaced by Σx =
√2σx (for two identical Gaussian colliding beams) according to Hirata the-
orem demonstrated in the appendix A of ref. [14]. As for the vertical kick,
however, one has to make an average over eq. 6 with the horizontal proba-
bility distribution function of the test particle, and one gets [13]:

δy′ =

where <>x means the average over the horizontal probability distribution
function of the test particle, and for two identical colliding Gaussian beams
<>x= 1/√2. It is obvious that eq. 9 is not the expression for the coherent
beam-beam kick. The average over eqs. 4 and 6 is only a technical operation
to simplify (or to make equivalence) a two dimensional problem to a one
dimensional one. To study both round and ﬂat beam cases, we expand δ¯r′
at x = 0 (for round beam we study only vertical plane since the formalism
in the horizontal plane is the same), δx′ and δy′ expressed in eqs. 7, 8 and
9, respectively, into Taylor series:

where s2m is the location of the 2mth multipole, βx(s) is the beta function in

freedom of motion, x, a speciﬁc name, such as horizontal, or vertical plane.

4 Beam-beam limited dynamic apertures

To make use of the general dynamic aperture formulae recalled in section 3,
one needs only to ﬁnd the equivalence relations by comparing three Hamilto-
nians expressed in eqs. 16, 17, and 18 with eq. 19, and it is found by analogy
that:

Table 1: summary of multipole coeﬃcients

where Cm,RB, Cm,F B,x, and Cm,F B,y are given in Table 1. Now by inserting
eqs. 22-24 into eq. 21 one can calculate dynamic apertures of diﬀerent
multipoles due to nonlinear beam-beam forces. For example, one can get the
dynamic apertures due to the beam-beam octupole nonlinear force:

In the following we will consider the case of Atotal,x,y(s)

Obviously, the normalized beam-beam eﬀect limited dynamic apertures are
determined only by the beam-beam tune shifts. The impact of this discovery
will be more appreciated later. When the higher order multipoles eﬀects
(2m > 8) can be neglected eqs. 25, 26 and 27 give very good approximations
dynamic apertures limited by one beam-beam IP. If there are NIP interaction
points in a ring the dynamic apertures described in eqs. 25 and 27 will be
reduced by a factor of √NIP (if these NIP interaction points can be regarded
as independent).

5 Beam lifetime due to beam-beam

interactions

We take the beam-beam limited dynamic aperture as the rigid mechanical
boundary, i.e., those particles which walk beyond this virtual boundary will
be regarded lost instantaneously. Based on this physical point of view we
can calculate the beam lifetime due to the nonlinear beam-beam eﬀect:

τbb ==

τy
2  

σy(s)2
Adyna,y(s)2 !

exp

Adyna,y(s)2

 

σy(s)2 !

(37)

where τy is the synchrotron radiation damping time in vertical plane. It is
interesting to note that eq. 37 is similar to but diﬀerent from the quantum
lifetime forluma [21] where that σy(s)2 is used instead of 2σy(s)2. The reason
is that the quantum radiation results in energy ﬂuctuations of an electron and
2σy(s)2 corresponds to the average of the square of the oscillation amplitude,
however, the dynamic apertures calculated above due to nonlinear forces
are relevant only to the projected motions. When the beam-beam octupole
nonlinear force dominates the dynamic aperture, by inserting eqs. 29, 30,
and 31 into eq. 37, or inserting eqs. 34, 35, and 36 into eq. 37 one gets:

If we deﬁne the lifetime divided by the corresponding damping time as nor-
malized beam lifetime, one ﬁnds that the beam-beam eﬀect limited normalized
lifetimes depend only on beam-beam tune shifts. Figs. 11 and 12 show the
normalized beam lifetime with respect to the beam-beam tune shifts for both
ﬂat and round beams.

6 The maximum beam-beam tune shifts for

ﬂat and round beams

Now it is high time for us to discuss the maximum beam-beam tune shift
problem.
In literatures the term “maximum beam-beam tune shift” of a
speciﬁc machine is not well deﬁned. One of the reasonable deﬁnitions would
be that the maximum beam-beam tune shift corresponding to a well deﬁned
minimum beam-beam limited lifetime. In this paper we propose to take this
well deﬁned minimum beam-beam limited lifetime as one hour (the idea is
to reduce eq. 28 to Atotal(s)
Abb(s), and to have a machine still working !).
Assuming that for both round and ﬂat beam cases one has the same τy, from
eqs. 41, 42 and 43 one ﬁnds the following relations:

It is proved theoretically why round beam scheme can almost double the
ξy,max of ﬂat beam scheme as previously discovered in the numerical simu-
lations [16][17], and why the vertical beam-beam tune shift reaches its limit
earlier than the horizontal one. Quantitatively, taking τy = 30 ms, one ﬁnds
that ξy,max,F B(τbb = 1 hour)= 0.0447, ξx,max,F B(τbb = 1 hour)= 0.0632, and
ξy,max,RB(τbb = 1 hour)= 0.0843.

Now we investigate how the order of nonlinear resonance aﬀects the max-
imum beam-beam tune shift. By using eqs. 44, 42, and 46, and assuming
that τx = τy, one gets the maximum beam-beam tune shift with respect to
the order of nonlinear resonance, m, as shown in Fig. 3, where each maxi-
mum beam-beam tune corresponds to each dominating multipole resonance.
For ﬂat beams, it is obvious that if the horizontal tune is not well chosen,
the ξF B
y,max can be 0.032 instead of 0.0447, however, if the vertical resonances
have been successfully avoided before ξx,F B reaches its limit, one could possi-
bly obtain ξx,max,F B(τbb = 1 hour)= 0.0632 even diﬃcultly. What should be
stressed is that in choosing the working point in the tune diagram, one has to
pay attention to the nonlinear resonances of order as high as 14. To explain
qualitatively why the maximum beam-beam tune shifts for both round and
ﬂat beams seem to be limited by the lowest order of resonance, i.e., the 1/4
resonance, we have plotted in Fig. 4 the sum of the multipole strengths from
m=4 to m=14 assuming that they have the same strength, as expressed:

A(Qy) =

1)m/2 sin(2πmQy)

(49)

m=14

Xm=4

(

−

On the same ﬁgure we have plotted also the ﬁrst term (octupole) in this
summation with two opposite phases as compare references, and it is ob-
vious that except two regions of Qy, (0.2 to 0.3) and (0.7 to 0.8), one has
always that the amplitude of the sum is almost the same as that of the oc-
tupole term, and in this case the dangerous Qy values are 0.225, 0.275, 0.725
and 0.775. Another reason for the lowest resonance dominating is that the
lower the resonance order the more stable the resonance facing to the phase
perturbations.

Now we discuss brieﬂy the choice of tunes (working point). Limited to one
IP and the ﬂat beam case, based on the original work of Bassetti (LNF-135,
Frascati, Italy), B. Richter has shown in ref.
[22] that the tune should be
chosen just above an integer or half integer to make a best use of dynamic beta

11

eﬀect, and this conclusion has been experimentally observed in CESR [23].
Combining this information with what suggested by eq. 49, one concludes
that the tune Q should be chosen in the regions (0,0.2) or (0.5,0.7) to obtain
a maximum luminosity. If the collision is eﬀectuated with a deﬁnite crossing
angle some important synchrobetatron nonlinear resonances, such as 3Qx ±
Qs = p, should be avoided also. More discussions on the crossing angle
eﬀects will be given in section 8. Taking CESR and PEP-II for examples, for
CESR one ﬁnds Qx = 10.523 and Qy = 9.597 [23], and for PEP-II the actual
0.01 for
operation working points are Qx = 0.610
0.01 for
Low Energy Ring (LER) and Qx = 0.565
High Energy Ring (HER) [24], which in principal consist with our suggestion.
In this paper, under the assumption that the two colliding beams always
have the same transverse dimensions, we have arrived at the beam-beam
eﬀect determined lifetimes expressed in eqs. 44, 45, and 46. For a given min-
imum normalized (with respect to the damping time) beam lifetime one gets
universal maximum beam-beam tune shift values corresponding to diﬀerent
cases. In a real machine the situation can be more complicated, such as the
ﬂip-ﬂop phenomenon which breaks the symmetry assumed above, and in this
case one can continue the discussion starting from eqs. 25, 26, and 27 by
diﬀerentiating σy from σ∗,y, and by replacing σ, σx by Σ/√2, Σx/√2, respec-
∗ + σ2 and Σx =
σ2
x. We will not, however,
tively, where Σ =

7 Applications to some machines

Let us look at three machines, PEP-II B-Factory [25] and DAΦNE [26], and
BTCF [27], and the ﬁrst two have been put to operation. The relevant
machine parameters are shown in Table 2. Figs. 5 and 6 give the theoretical
estimations for the beam-beam limited beam lifetimes in both PEP-II LER
and HER. Figs. 7 and 8 show the beam lifetimes versus the beam-beam
tune shifts in both LER and HER. It is obvious that the nominal charge in
the bunch of HER is close to the limit which sets the beam lifetime in low
energy ring, however, the beam lifetime in HER is much longer than that in
LER. The theoretical results consist with the experimental observation [25].
Fig. 9 shows the beam lifetime prediction for the DAΦNE e+e− collider with
single IP. Finally, we study the beam-beam limited beam lifetime in BTCF

8 Discussion on the collision with a crossing

angle

To get a higher luminosity one could run a circular collider in the multibunch
operation mode with a deﬁnite collision crossing angle. Diﬀerent from the
head-on collision discussed above, the transverse kick received by a test par-
ticle due to the space charge ﬁeld of the counter rotating bunch will depend
on its longitudinal position with respect to the center of the bunch which the
test particle belongs to. In this section we consider ﬁrst a ﬂat beam colliding
with another ﬂat beam with a half crossing angle of φ in the horizontal plane.
Due to the crossing angle the two curvilinear coordinates of the two collid-
ing beams at the interaction point will be no longer coincide. The detailed
discussion about the coordinates transformation can be found in ref.
[28].
When the crossing angle is not too large one has:

x∗ = x + zφ

(50)

where x∗ is the horizontal displacement of the test particle to the center of the
colliding bunch, z and x are the longitudinal and horizontal displacements of
the test particle from the center of the bunch to which it belongs. Now we
recall eq. 17 which describes the Hamiltonian of the horizontal motion of a
test particle in the head-on collision mode, and by inserting eq. 50 into eq.

Since the test particle can occupy a deﬁnite z within the bunch according to
a certain probability distribution, say Gaussian, it is reasonable to replace z
in eq. 51 by σz, and in this way we reduce a two dimensional Hamiltonian
expressed in eq. 51 into a one dimensional one. What should be noted is that
eq. 51 takes only the test particle’s longitudinal position into consideration
which is regarded as a small perturbation to the head-on collision case, and
the geometrical eﬀect will included later. To simplify our analysis we consider
Qs = p
only the lowest synchrobetatron nonlinear resonance, i.e., 3Qx ±
(where Qs is the synchrotron oscillation tune, and p is an integer) which turns
out to be the most dangerous one [29][30]. Following the same procedure in
section 4 one gets the dynamic aperture due to the lowest synchrobetatron
nonlinear resonance as follows:

where Φ = σz
φ is Piwinski angle. Now we are facing a problem of how to
σx
combine the two eﬀects: the principal vertical beam-beam eﬀect and the
horizontal crossing angle induced perturbation. To solve this problem we
assume that the total beam lifetime due to the vertical and the horizontal
crossing angle beam-beam eﬀects can be expressed as:

(54)

where
Ry,8,F B corresponds to eq. 31. After the necessary preparations, we
can try to answer two frequently asked questions. Firstly, for a machine
working at the head-on collision beam-beam limit, how the beam lifetime
depends on the crossing angle? Secondly, for a deﬁnite crossing angle, to keep
the beam lifetime the same as that of the head-on collision at the beam-beam
limit, how much one has to operate the machine below the designed head-on
peak luminosity? To answer the ﬁrst question we deﬁne a lifetime reduction
factor:

R(Φ) =

(FB)

(55)

τ ∗
bb,total
τ ∗
bb,y

where τ ∗
bb,y is given in eq. 43, and R(Φ) will tell us to what extent one
can increase Φ. Concerning the second question, one can imagine to reduce
the luminosity at beam-beam limit by a factor of f (Φ) in order to against
the additional lifetime reduction term due to the deﬁnite crossing angle.
Physically, from eq. 54 one requires:

In fact, f (Φ) corresponds to the luminosity reduction due to the
synchrobetatron resonance, and to ﬁnd out the total luminosity reduction
factor, one has to include the geometrical eﬀects [31][32]. The total luminos-
ity reduction factor can be expressed as follows:

F (Φ) = f (Φ)

(FB)

where hourglass eﬀect is no taken into account (i.e. βy,IP > σz). Tak-
ing KEKB factory as an interesting example [25], one has σx = 90 µm,
σz = 0.4 cm, φ = 11 mrad, Φ = 0.49, ξx,design,F B = 0.039, and by putting
Φ = 0.49 into eq. 58 one ﬁnds F (0.49) = 83.5% which is very close to a
three dimensional numerical simulation result, i.e., 85% of designed head-on
[33]. In Figs. 11 and 12 we show how R(Φ) and
luminosity, given in ref.
F (Φ) depend on Piwinski angle where ξx,design,F B = 0.039 has been used in
Fig. 12. Finally, when the crossing angle is in the vertical plane or the beam
is round, one gets:

Rsyn−beta,x in eq.
σx
54 by eq. 60 or eq. 61 and following the same procedure shown above one can
easily make the corresponding discussions on the luminosity reduction eﬀects.
What should be remembered is that the geometrical luminosity reduction
factors for the vertical crossing angle and the round beam cases are (1 +
(Φ/r)2)−1/2 and (1 + Φ2), respectively.

9 Conclusion

In this paper we have established analytical formulae for the beam-beam
interaction limited dynamic apertures and beam lifetimes in e+e− circular
colliders for both round and ﬂat beam cases. It is shown analytically why for
ﬂat colliding beams one has always ξy,max around 0.045 and why this value
can be almost doubled by using round beams. Applications to the machines,
such as PEP-II, DAΦNE, and BTCF have been made. Finally, the luminos-
ity reduction due to a crossing angle has been discussed, and an analytical
formula for the luminosity reduction factor is derived and compared with a
numerical simulation result for KEKB factory.

Abstract

The ILC accelerator parameters and detector concepts are still under discussion in the world-
wide community. As will be shown, the performance of the BeamCal, the calorimeter in the
very forward area of the ILC detector, is very sensitive to the beam parameter and crossing
angle choices. We propose here BeamCal designs for a small (0 or 2 mrad) and large (20 mrad)
crossing angles and report about the veto performance study done. As illustration, the inﬂuence
of several proposed beam parameter sets and crossing-angles on the signal to background ratio
in the stau search is estimated for a particular realization of the super-symmetric model.

Introduction

The TESLA machine parameters were chosen to achieve a high peak luminosity with only little
room for operational optimization. As a more ﬂexible approach [1] deﬁnes a number of diﬀerent
machine conﬁgurations achieving similar peak luminosities. We consider here the impact of these
schemes on the pair depositions in the BeamCal. The pairs, stemming from the beamstrahlung
photon conversions, deposit several TeV of energy in the BeamCal (see Fig. 1) with large local
energy density ﬂuctuations from bunch to bunch. Identiﬁcation of single electrons on top of these
depositions is challenging at the inner part of the BeamCal even at the highest electron energies [2].

For a 2 mrad crossing angle the depositions of the pairs in the BeamCal are very similar to the
ones of the head-on scheme (Fig. 1a). The only change required for the BeamCal is a slightly larger
inner radius.

The 20 mrad crossing angle geometry is proposed with several possible arrangements for the
magnetic ﬁeld inside the detector. In the DID2 [3] ﬁeld conﬁguration the magnetic ﬁeld is directed
along the incoming beam lines with a kink at the transverse plane containing the IP. Hence the
incoming beams will not emit synchrotron radiation and their spins will not precess before they col-
lide. However, the amount of beamstrahlung deposited in the BeamCal rises considerably (Fig. 1b),
causing also higher background in the tracking detectors due to backscattering. Conversely, if the
magnetic ﬁeld is directed along outgoing beam lines with a kink at the IP plane (a conﬁguration
referred to as anti-DID), the depositions on the BeamCal and background in the central detector
are very similar to the head-on case.

The BeamCal is an important tool to identify two photon events by detecting either electrons
or positrons with an energy near the beam energy. Two photon events constitute the most seri-
ous background for many search channels which are characterized by missing energy and missing
momentum. In most cases lepton pairs produced in photon-photon processes have signiﬁcantly dif-
ferent topology and kinematics in comparison to the search channel and can be rejected by simple
cuts. However, since the two photon cross-section is typically several orders of magnitude larger,
events in the tails of the kinematic distributions become important.

The electron veto performance, obtained from simulations, is used to estimate the suppression
of the two-photon background in the diﬀerent ILC schemes. The search for a ˜τ super-symmetric
particle is taken as a benchmark process, following the approach described in [4]. In the particular
realization of the super-symmetric model, which is consider here (point 3 in the list of SUSY
benchmark points for the ILC detector [5]), the ˜τ ’s are the second lightest super-symmetric particles
which are pair-produced in e+e− annihilation and decay into lighter neutralinos, which escape
undetected, and regular τ ’s. In the context of this model, the ˜τ ’s and neutralinos could combine to
provide a plausible, quantitative explanation for the amount of dark matter in the universe. The
amount is directly related to the mass diﬀerence between ˜τ and neutralino and is assumed here to
be equal 5 GeV.

2 Simulation and Results

Single electrons and beamstrahlung pairs were simulated for 4 proposed accelerator parameter sets
(Tab. 1) at zero crossing angle and for the Nominal set at 20 mrad crossing angle with the DID
magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration. Beamstrahlung was generated using GUINEA-PIG [6]. The detector
was simulated in GEANT4 [7].

The BeamCal is located 370 cm from the interaction point. The inner radius is 1.5 cm for 0
mrad crossing angle and 2 cm for 20 mrad. The outer radius is 16.5 cm. For the 20 mrad crossing
angle area of 30 degrees in r
φ plane between the beam pipes for the in and outgoing beams is
assumed to be 100% ineﬃcient for particle detection, in anticipation of the practical diﬃculties to
instrument this area.

Fine granularity is necessary to identify the depositions from high energy electrons and photons
on top of energy depositions from beamstrahlung remnants. The simulated sampling calorimeter is
longitudinally divided into 30 disks of tungsten, each 1 X0 thick (3.5 mm) interleaved by diamond
active layers (0.5 mm). The sensitive planes are divided into pads with a size of about half a
Moli`ere radius (5 mm) in both dimensions, as shown in Fig. 1.

The energy depositions from pairs and the single electrons depositions are superimposed in the
sensor pads. A reconstruction algorithm is applied to the output. The reconstruction procedure is
described in more details in [8].

To evaluate the ability to suppress two-photon processes, we used the energy and polar angle
distributions of the two-photon background events remaining in the analysis described in [4] after
application of all selection cuts other than the electron veto [9]. At this stage of the analysis, 20
105.
stau events are left, while the number of surviving 2-photon background events is about 2.7
Fig. 2 shows the energy and spatial distributions of these electrons. Most of them have nearly
the beam energy and hit the BeamCal outside the area aﬀected by pairs, though the distribution
has tails down to the smallest angles and energies. It is important to notice that this distribution
depends on the particular stau-neutralino mass diﬀerence considered. In this study it is 5 GeV, if
it would be larger (smaller), for example the polar angle distribution would broaden (sharpen) and
shift to larger (smaller) values.

The average eﬃciency to veto electrons is shown in Fig. 2 for several electron energies for head-
on collisions and Nominal beam parameters. An electron of 250 GeV is vetoed even in regions
with high background with almost 100% eﬃciency. The eﬃciency drops near the innermost radius,
partly due to shower leakage. Electrons of 75 GeV are identiﬁed with high eﬃciency only at larger
radii.

Depending on the cuts in the reconstruction algorithm, fake electron candidates can also be
found. This can be either high energy particles from tails of the incoherent pair production process
or background ﬂuctuations which mimic the electron signal.
In this study, the reconstruction
algorithm was tuned for a misidentiﬁcation rate of 10%.

all selection cuts except the BeamCal veto. Right: The eﬃciency to veto an electron of energy 75,
150, 250 GeV as a function of the radius in the BeamCal.

For each beam parameter set in table 1 veto eﬃciencies are estimated from simulations in the
instrumented area of the BeamCal (see ﬁgure 1). These eﬃciencies were used to determine the
number of remaining non-vetoed two-photon background events in the stau analysis, see table 2.
Results are given for energy cuts of 50 and 75 GeV, showing that a relatively low energy cut of
50 GeV reduces considerably this background contribution. For the chosen benchmark physics
scenario the chances to see ˜τ particles are very good for most of the accelerator designs, except
the Low P scheme in which this remaining background completely dominates the selected event
sample. By far the best situation is obtained for the Low Q scheme.

Table 2: The number of un-vetoed background events. The number of ˜τ events is 20.

In the cases of 2 mrad or 20 mrad with the anti-DID ﬁeld conﬁguration we expect the BeamCal
performance to be similar to that in the head-on scheme, as the corresponding pairs deposition
distributions are similar.
In case of 20 mrad crossing angle with a DID ﬁeld conﬁguration, we
would have no chance to see ˜τ production for this benchmark scenario.

For the 20 mrad crossing angle geometry, an additional reduction in expected signal-to-
background ratio arises independent of choosing a DID or anti-DID magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration,
because removing events with electrons missed in the larger un-instrumented part of the BeamCal
(see ﬁgure 1) requires additional special selection cuts [4] and because of the increased fake veto
rate from Bhabha processes with only a single electron seen [2]. Estimations have shown that these
additional eﬀects would amount to about 30-50% in total for the present super-symmetric scenario,
which could be compensated for with additional luminosity.

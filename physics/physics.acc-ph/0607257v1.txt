A three-dimensional, spae-frequeny model for simulation of inter-

ation in free-eletron lasers (FELs) is presented. The model utilizes

an expansion of the total eletromagneti (cid:28)eld (radiation and spae-

harge waves) in terms of transverse eigenmodes of the waveguide, in

whih the (cid:28)eld is exited and propagates. The mutual interation be-

tween the eletron beam and the eletromagneti (cid:28)eld is fully desribed

by oupled equations, expressing the evolution of mode amplitudes and

eletron beam dynamis.

Based on the three-dimensional model, a numerial partile simula-

tion ode was developed. A set of oupled-mode exitation equations,

expressed in the frequeny domain, are solved self-onsistently with

the equations of partiles motion. Variational numerial methods were

used to simulate exitation of bakward modes. At present, the ode

an simulate free-eletron lasers operation in various modes: spon-

taneous (shot-noise) and self-ampli(cid:28)ed spontaneous emission (SASE),

super-radiane and stimulated emission, all in the non-linear Compton

or Raman regimes.

Introdution

Several numerial models have been suggested for three-dimensional simu-

lation of the FEL operation in the non-linear regime [1℄-[10℄. Unlike a pre-

viously developed steady-state models, in whih the interation is assumed

to be at a single frequeny (or at disrete frequenies), the approah pre-

sented in this paper onsiders a ontinuum of frequenies, enabling solution

of non-stationary, wide-band interations in eletron devies operating in the

linear (small-signal) and non-linear (saturation) regimes. Solution of exita-

tion equations in the spae-frequeny domain inherently takes into aount

dispersive e(cid:27)ets arising from avity and beam loading. The model is based

on a oupled-mode approah expressed in the frequeny domain [11℄ and used

in the WB3D partile simulation ode to alulate the total eletromagneti

(cid:28)eld exited by an eletron beam drifting along a waveguide in the presene

of a wiggler (cid:28)eld of FEL.

The unique features of the present model enable one to solve non-stationary

interations taking plae in eletron devies suh as spontaneous and super-

radiant emissions in a pulsed beam FEL, shown in Fig. 1. We employed

the ode to demonstrate a spontaneous and super-radiant emissions exited

when a bunh of eletrons passes through a wiggler of an FEL. Calulations

of the power and energy spetral distribution in the frequeny domain were

arried out. The temporal (cid:28)eld was found by utilizing a proedure of in-

verse Fourier transformation. Super-radiane in the speial limit of 'grazing'

(where dispersive waveguide e(cid:27)ets play a role) was also investigated.

2 Dynamis of the partiles

The state of the partile i is desribed by a six-omponents vetor, whih
onsists of the partile's position oordinates ri = (xi, yi, zi) and veloity
vetor vi . Here (x, y) are the transverse oordinates and z is the longitudinal

axis of propagation. The veloity of eah partile, in the presene of eletri

E(r, t) and magneti B(r, t) = µH(r, t) (cid:28)elds, is found from the Lorentz fore

equation:

d
dt

e
m

(γivi) = −

[E(ri, t) + vi × B(ri, t)]

(1)

where e and m are the eletron harge and mass respetively. The (cid:28)elds

represent the total (DC and AC) fores operating on the partile, and inlude

2

also the self-(cid:28)eld due to spae-harge. The Lorentz relativisti fator γi of

eah partile is found from the equation for kineti energy:

dγi
dt

= −

e
mc2

vi · E(ri, t)

where c is the veloity of light.

The equations are rewritten, suh that the oordinate of the propagation

axis z beomes the independent variable, by replaing the time derivative
d
dt = vzi

d
dz . This de(cid:28)nes a transformation of variables for eah partile, whih

enables one to write the three-dimensional equations of motion in terms of

z :

The time it takes a partile to arrive at a position z , is a funtion of the
time t0i when the partile entered at z = 0, and its instantaneous longitudinal
veloity vzi(z) along the path of motion:

3 The driving urrent

The distribution of the urrent in the beam is determined by the position

and the veloity of the partiles:

J(r, t) = −

qi vi δ(x − xi) δ(y − yi) δ [z − zi(t)] =

= −

qi

δ(x − xi) δ(y − yi) δ [t − ti(z)]

(6)

here qi is the harge of the ith maro partile in the simulation. The Fourier

transform (in the positive frequeny domain) of the urrent density is given

by:

e

J(r, f ) = 2u(f )

J(r, t)e−j2πf tdt =

= −2u(f )

δ(x − xi) δ(y − yi) e−j2πf ti(z)

This Fourier transform of the urrent (7) is substituted in the following

exitation equations to (cid:28)nd the evolution of the eletromagneti (cid:28)elds.

5 The Variational Priniple

The solution of the equations (3), (4) and (10) for forward waves is done

by integrating the equations in the positive z -diretion for a given boundary
onditions at the point z = 0. For bakward waves the natural physial
boundary onditions are given at the end of the interation region z = Lw
and the diretion of the integration is the negative z -diretion.

6 Numerial results

We shall use the ode to investigate super-radiant emission radiated when

an ultra short e-beam bunh (with duration of 1 pS, muh shorter than

the temporal period of the signal) passes through the wiggler of an FEL

having operational parameters as given in table 1. In this ase, the power of

super-radiant (oherent) emission is muh higher than that of the inoherent

spontaneous emission [12℄.

Fig. 2 shows two ases of dispersion relations: when the beam energy is set

to 1.375 MeV, there are two separated intersetion points between the beam

and waveguide dispersion urves, orresponding to the (cid:16)slow(cid:17) (vg1 < vz0 ) and
(cid:16)fast(cid:17) (vg2 > vz0 ) synhronism frequenies 29 GHz and 100 GHz, respetively.

Lowering the beam energy to 1.066 MeV, results in a single intersetion

(at 44 GHz), where the beam dispersion line is tangential to the waveguide

dispersion urve (vg = vz0 (cid:22) (cid:16)grazing limit(cid:17)).

The alulated spetral density of energy (cid:29)ux in the ase of two well-

separated solutions is shown in Fig. 3a. The spetrum peaks at the two

synhronism frequenies with main lobe bandwidth of ∆f1,2 ≈ 1

τsp1,2

, where

is the slippage time. The orresponding temporal wave-

paket (shown in Fig. 3b) onsist of two (cid:16)slow(cid:17) and (cid:16)fast(cid:17) pulses with dura-

tions equal to the slippage times modulating arriers at their respetive syn-

hronism frequenies. The spetral bandwidth in the ase of grazing shown

in Fig. 4a, is determined by dispersive e(cid:27)ets of the waveguide taking into

aount by the simulation. The orresponding temporal wavepaket is shown

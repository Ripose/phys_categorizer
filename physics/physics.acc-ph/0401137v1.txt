Abstract

Simple formulas for optimization of VUV and X-ray SASE FELs are presented.
The FEL gain length and the optimal beta-function are explicitly expressed in
terms of the electron beam and undulator parameters. The FEL saturation length
is estimated taking into account quantum diﬀusion in the undulator. Examples
of the FEL optimization are given. Parameters of a SASE FEL, operating at the
Compton wavelength, are suggested.

1 Introduction

Successful operation of the VUV (vacuum ultraviolet) FEL (free electron laser) at the

TESLA Test Facility at DESY [1,2], based on SASE (self-ampliﬁed spontaneous emission)

principle [3], has stimulated a rapidly growing interest in the development of VUV and

X-ray FELs. A number of projects (see, for instance, [4–8]) are now at diﬀerent stages of

design and construction.

At the ﬁrst stage of a SASE FEL design one looks for the dependence of the FEL saturation

length on the wavelength, electron beam parameters, undulator parameters, and beta-

function. Usually the parameters are optimized for the shortest design wavelength since

the saturation length is the largest in this case. The saturation length is proportional to

the gain length (e-folding length) of the fundamental transverse mode (see [9] for more

details). The gain length can be found by the solution of the FEL eigenvalue equation.

The eigenvalue equation for a high-gain FEL, including diﬀraction of radiation, emittance,

and energy spread, was derived in [10,11]. There exist approximate solutions [12,13] of

this equation. The exact solution was presented in [14] as well as an approximate solution

(with a limited validity range). The latter solution was ﬁtted [14] using 3 dimensionless

groups of parameters, and 19 ﬁtting coeﬃcients. An approximate solution, that ﬁts the

exact solution in the entire parameter space with high accuracy (better that 1 %), was

presented in [15]. A numerical algorithm for ﬁnding this approximate solution is very fast

and robust. It was used to obtain the main results of this paper.

In this paper we present the explicit, simple and rather accurate dependencies of the FEL

gain length on the beam and undulator parameters. Our formulas are not universal, but

they provide a good accuracy (better than 5 % for the gain length) in a typical parameter

range of VUV and X-ray FELs. We present the formulas without derivation since they

were not derived analytically. In some sense the parametric dependencies were guessed,

and then the ﬁtting coeﬃcients were found from the solution of the eigenvalue equation.

For instance, we used only 2 ﬁtting coeﬃcients for the gain length with the optimized beta-

function. Our formulas allow one to quickly estimate FEL saturation length, including the

principal eﬀect of energy diﬀusion in the undulator due to quantum ﬂuctuations of the

2

undulator radiation. In addition, we present two practical examples of using our design

formulas: optimization of SASE FEL with negligible energy spread, and the limitation on

SASE FEL wavelength taking into account quantum diﬀusion. In particular, we suggest for

the ﬁrst time the set of parameters for a SASE FEL operating at the Compton wavelength.

2 Gain length for the optimized beta-function

Let us consider an axisymmetric electron beam with a current I, and a Gaussian dis-

tribution in transverse phase space and in energy [14,15]. The focusing structure in the

undulator is a superposition of the natural undulator focusing and an external alternating-

gradient focusing. The eigenvalue equation [14,15] is valid under the following condition

[15]:

parameter:

K = 0.934 λw[cm] Brms[T] ,

Brms being the rms undulator ﬁeld.

where Lf is the period of the external focusing structure, β is an average beta-function, ǫ

is the rms emittance of the electron beam, and λr is the FEL resonant wavelength. The

In what follows we assume that the beta-function is optimized so that the FEL gain

length takes the minimal value for given wavelength, beam and undulator parameters.
Under this condition the solution of the eigenvalue equation for the ﬁeld gain length 1 can

Note that the condition (6) is usually satisﬁed in realistic designs of VUV and X-ray FELs

when one does optimization for the shortest wavelength (deﬁning the total undulator

length). The condition (7) is practically not a limitation. To illustrate the accuracy of the

formula (3) we present a numerical example. The following nominal operating point is

chosen: λr = 1 nm, λw = 3 cm, K = 1, I = 2.5 kA, ǫn = 2 µm, σE = 1 MeV, energy is 2.8

GeV, undulator is planar. We scan over diﬀerent parameters and compare the gain length

calculated with formula (3) and by solving the eigenvalue equation [15]. The results are

presented in Figs. 1-6.

Finally, let us note that the saturation length cannot be directly found from the eigenvalue

equation. However, with an accuracy 10-20 % one can accept the following estimate:

3 Inﬂuence of quantum diﬀusion in an undulator on saturation length

Energy spread growth due to the quantum ﬂuctuations of the spontaneous undulator

radiation can be an important eﬀect [3,16] in future SASE FELs. The rate of the energy

diﬀusion is given by [17]:

To estimate the FEL saturation length, we accept the following scheme. First, we neglect

energy diﬀusion and ﬁnd a zeroth order approximation to the saturation length from (9),

(3)-(5). Then we calculate an induced energy spread in the middle of the undulator from

(10), add it quadratically to the initial energy spread, and ﬁnd a new expression for δ.

Then, using (9), (3)-(5), we ﬁnd the ﬁrst approximation to the saturation length. Then

we do the next iteration, etc. Finally, the saturation length can be estimated as

which should be used instead of δ in (7) to check the applicability range and in (8) to

Although formula (12) is rather crude estimate, it can be used for quick orientation in

the parameter space with a posteriori check using a numerical simulation code.

4 Examples of SASE FEL optimization

4.1 Optimized FEL with a negligible energy spread

Formulas, presented in the previous Sections, can be used for the optimization of undulator

parameters as soon as a speciﬁc type of the undulator is chosen. We demonstrate such a

possibility with the planar NdFeB undulator of which magnetic ﬁeld can be described by

the following formula [8]:

Bmax[T] = 3.694 exp

where g is the undulator gap. The rms value of the parameter K is given by Eq. (2) with
Brms = Bmax/√2.

We assume that the energy spread eﬀect on the FEL operation can be neglected (δ , δq →
0). Then, using (3), (2) and (15), we minimize the gain length for a given undulator gap.

The optimal undulator period is found to be

for

g > 0.5 cm

The optimal value of K is then deﬁned from (15) and (2), the electron beam energy - from

(1), and the optimal beta-function - from (8). The minimal gain length can be expressed

Using estimate of the saturation length (9), we ﬁnd the minimal wavelength at which

SASE FEL can saturate within the given undulator length Lw:

4.2 SASE FEL at the Compton wavelength

Another example is the optimization of sub-Angstrom FELs for which the eﬀect of quan-

tum diﬀusion in the undulator can play an important role. We consider the case when the

energy spread is dominated by the quantum diﬀusion, and neglect initial energy spread

0). Optimizing undulator period and parameter K in (12), we get the following

Note that in some cases the optimal undulator parameters can be impractical. In any

case, the estimate (19) gives a lower limit. The following numerical examples show that

one can be close to this limit with technically feasible undulator parameters.

Let us consider the electron beam parameters (peak current and emittance) assumed in
[18]. One of the examples, considered in [18], is a SASE FEL operating at λr = 0.28 ˚A
with I = 5 kA and ǫn = 0.3 µm. Another example is even more ambitious: λr = 0.12 ˚A
with I = 5 kA and ǫn = 0.1 µm.

We try to push the wavelength closer to the extreme given by Eq. (19). In our ﬁrst

example we assume I = 5 kA and ǫn = 0.3 µm. With these parameters the wavelength

λr = 0.1 ˚A can be reached at the electron beam energy 23 GeV in a planar undulator
with λw = 2 cm and K = 1 (with the gap g = 0.7 cm according to (15) and (2)). The

optimal beta-function is about 40 m, and the saturation length is estimated at 160 m.

The second example is a SASE FEL operating at the Compton wavelength, λr = λc =
0.0234 ˚A (photon energy is 0.5 MeV). We assume the electron beam with I = 5 kA and

ǫn = 0.1 µm, the energy is 40 GeV. We choose a helical undulator with λw = 2 cm and

K = 0.7. The optimal beta-function is about 35 m, and the saturation is reached within

200 m. Our estimates show that quantum eﬀects, other than energy diﬀusion, give small

corrections to the classical description and can be neglected.

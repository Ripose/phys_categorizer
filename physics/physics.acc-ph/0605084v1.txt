Abstract

Space charge eﬀects can be very important for the dynamics of intense particle beams, as they

repeatedly pass through nonlinear focusing elements, aiming to maximize the beam’s luminosity

properties in the storage rings of a high energy accelerator. In the case of hadron beams, whose

charge distribution can be considered as “frozen” within a cylindrical core of small radius com-

pared to the beam’s dynamical aperture, analytical formulas have been recently derived [1] for the

contribution of space charges within ﬁrst order Hamiltonian perturbation theory. These formulas

involve distribution functions which, in general, do not lead to expressions that can be evaluated in

closed form. In this paper, we apply this theory to an example of a charge distribution, whose eﬀect

on the dynamics can be derived explicitly and in closed form, both in the case of 2–dimensional as

well as 4–dimensional mapping models of hadron beams. We ﬁnd that, even for very small values

of the “perveance” (strength of the space charge eﬀect) the long term stability of the dynamics

changes considerably. In the ﬂat beam case, the outer invariant “tori” surrounding the origin dis-

appear, decreasing the size of the beam’s dynamical aperture, while beyond a certain threshold the

beam is almost entirely lost. Analogous results in mapping models of beams with 2-dimensional

cross section demonstrate that in that case also, even for weak tune depressions, orbital diﬀusion

is enhanced and many particles whose motion was bounded now escape to inﬁnity, indicating that

space charges can impose signiﬁcant limitations on the beam’s luminosity.

INTRODUCTION

One of the fundamental problems concerning the dynamics of particle beams in the stor-

age rings of high energy accelerators is the determination of the beam’s dynamical aperture,

i.e. the maximal domain containing the particles closest to their ideal circular path and for

the longest possible time. For example, “ﬂat” hadron beams (experiencing largely horizontal

betatron oscillations) can be described by 2–dimensional (2D) area–preserving maps, where

the existence of invariant curves around the ideal stable path at the origin, guarantees the

stability of the beam’s dynamics for inﬁnitely long times [2, 3]. The reason for this is that

the chaotic motion between these invariant curves is always bounded and the particles never

escape to inﬁnity. Other important phenomena that arise in this context is the presence of a

major resonance in the form of a chain of islands through which the beam may be collected,

or the existence of an outer invariant curve surrounding these islands, which serves as a

boundary of the motion and thus allows an estimate of the beam’s dynamical aperture.

On the other hand, hadron beams with a 2 - dimensional cross section require the use

of 4–dimensional (4D) symplectic mappings for the study of their dynamics [4, 5, 6, 7, 8].

In fact, if longitudinal (or synchrotron) oscillations also need to be included the mappings

become 6–dimensional. In such cases, the problems of particle loss are severe, as chaotic

regions around diﬀerent resonances are connected, providing a network of paths through

which particles can move away from the origin, and eventually escape from the beam after

suﬃciently long times.

In this Letter, we add to these issues the presence of space charges within a core radius

rc, which is small compared to the beam’s dynamical aperture.

In other words, we will

assume that our proton (or antiproton) beam is intense enough so that the eﬀect of a charge

distribution concentrated within this core radius cannot be neglected. Furthermore, we will

consider this distribution as cylindrically symmetric and “frozen” (i.e. time independent, so

that it may be self consistent with the linear lattice) and study the dynamics of a hadron

beam as it passes repeatedly through nonlinear magnetic focusing elements of the FODO

cell type. This system has been studied extensively in the absence of space charge eﬀects in

[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and the question we raise now is whether its dynamics can be seriously

aﬀected if space charges are also taken into consideration.

Space charge presents a fundamental limitation to high intensity circular accelerators.

2

Its eﬀects are especially important in the latest designs of high-intensity proton rings, which

require beam losses much smaller than presently achieved in existing facilities. It is there-

fore necessary to estimate the major space charge eﬀects which could lead to emittance

growth and associated beam loss [9]. The interplay between nonlinear eﬀects, typical of

single-particle dynamics, and space charge, typical of multi-particle dynamics induced by

the Coulomb interaction, represents a diﬃcult challenge. To understand better these phe-

nomena, an intense experimental campaign was launched at the CERN Proton Synchrotron

[10]. It is very important, therefore, to develop analytical techniques which could be utilized

in order to study and localize the associated web of resonances (see e.g. [11]) to obtain an

analytical estimation of the dynamic aperture, as suggested e.g. in [12].

In a recent paper, Benedetti and Turchetti [1] used ﬁrst order canonical perturbation

theory to obtain analytical expressions for the jump in the position and momenta due to the

multipolar kicks in such maps, showing that the space charges eﬀectively modulate the tune

at every passage of the particle through a nonlinear element of the lattice. In particular,

they derived the new position and momentum coordinates after the nth passage through a

FODO cell in the thin lens approximation, as the iterates of the 2D map

0 determines the tune depression in (5), which must

R

be small for the above analysis to be valid [1].

The stage is now set for the investigation of space charge eﬀects on the dynamics. How-

ever, the space advances Ω(J) needed in (1) at every iteration depend on integrals of the

distribution function g(u) that may not be available analytically. To overcome this diﬃculty,

we choose in section II a particular form of g(u) for which these integrals can be explicitly

carried out not only for 2D maps of the “ﬂat” beam case, but also for 4D maps describing

vertical as well as horizontal deﬂections of the beam’s particles.

Thus, in section III we perform numerical experiments to examine the inﬂuence of space

charges on the dynamics and ﬁnd indeed that even for small perveance values the long

term stability of the beam is signiﬁcantly aﬀected. In particular, as ξ grows (or the tune

depression ω/ω0 decreases from 1), perturbations of 2D as well as 4D maps show that the

outer invariant “surfaces” surrounding the ideal circular path at the origin disappear and

the beam’s dynamical aperture is seriously limited. Only the major unperturbed stable reso-

nances survive, with their “boundaries” clearly diminished by the presence of new resonances

due to space charge eﬀects. In our 2D mapping model, a threshold value of ξ (or ω/ω0) was

found, beyond which the beam is practically destroyed. The paper ends by describing our

concluding remarks and work in progress in section IV.

Space charge eﬀects on beam stability became a relevant topic during the years when

construction of medium-low energy high currents accelerators, such as SNS and the design of

the FAIR rings at GSI were started [11, 13, 14] (see also many articles in the SNS Accelerator

Physics Proceedings of the last few years). The role of collective eﬀects and resonances has

attracted considerable attention, since they can cause signiﬁcant beam quality deterioration

and losses [15]. Another relevant issue is the coupling with the longitudinal motion which

modulates the transverse tune and induces losses by resonance crossing as shown by recent

experiments [10].

4

High intensity rings, where the bunches can circulate over one million turns, require a

careful analysis of the long term stability of the beam. Since the commonly used codes

require large CPU times and exhibit an emittance growth due to numerical noise, they

are not suited for long term dynamic aperture studies and the use of faster methods is

necessary [13]. The method proposed in [1] allows us to introduce space charge eﬀects in

one single evaluation of the map, when a thin sextupole or octupole is present, just as one

does in the absence of space charge, and is thus especially well suited for dynamical aperture

calculations.

that this function satisﬁes the requirements that g(0) = 1, g1(t) ∝ t as t → 0 and g1(t) → 1

as t → 0, (using (6)), as expected from the theory [1].

Evaluating now by elementary manipulations the integral in (3), using (7) and (6), we

whose dynamics has already been studied extensively in [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] in the absence of space

tune values qx = 0.61903, and qy = 0.4152, in

ω01 = 2πqx, ω02 = 2πqy,

(17)

a large dynamical aperture is achieved, with interesting chains of resonant “tori” surrounding

the origin. In section III we will study what happens to these structures when ξ > 0 (i.e

ω1 < ω01, ω2 < ω02) and space charge eﬀects are taken into account. Before doing this,

however, it is necessary to describe how the integrals in (14) are to be evaluated: Let us

This is clearly not an elementary integral. Notice, however, that all terms in the denominator
of (23) are positive and as u → ∞ the integrand vanishes as u−4. It is, therefore, expected to

converge very rapidly and may be computed, at every iteration of the map, using standard

routines. For practical purposes, however, in section III below, we prefer to compute instead

its equivalent form (21). Of course, as explained above, a similar integral, K2, also needs to

be computed (with 1 → 2 in (18), (21) and (22)), whence Ω1 and Ω2 are found and the next

iteration of the 4D map (16) can be evaluated.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

Let us now turn to some practical applications of the above theory to speciﬁc problems

concerning the stability of hadron beams passing through FODO cell magnetic focusing

elements and experiencing sextupole nonlinearities, as described in [2, 3, 4]. First, we shall

consider the ﬂat beam case (1), for the speciﬁc tune value qx = 0.21 corresponding to

frequency ω0 = 2πqx = 1.32, exhibiting, in the absence of space charge perturbations, the

phase space picture shown in Figure 1(a) below. As we see in this ﬁgure, the region of

bounded particle motion extends to a radius of about 0.54 units from the origin. There are

also 5 islands of a major resonance surrounded by invariant curves (or 1D “tori”), whose

outermost boundary delimits the so - called dynamical aperture of the beam. Outside that

domain there are chains of smaller islands (representing higher order resonances) and chaotic

regions through which particles eventually escape to inﬁnity. This escape occurs, of course,

at diﬀerent speeds due to the well - known phenomenon of “stickiness”, depending on how

close the orbits are to the invariant curves surrounding the islands.

Let us now consider a space charge distribution of the form (7) with a “frozen core” of

radius rc = 0.1, which is small compared with the radius of the beam’s dynamical aperture.

Our purpose is to vary the value of the preveance ξ > 0, cf. (4), starting from ξ = 0, to

estimate the eﬀects of space charge on the dynamics.

Setting ξ = 0.001 (ω/ω0 ≃ 0.97), for example, which is quite small compared with

r2
c = 0.01, we observe in Figure 1(b) that the picture has signiﬁcantly changed. In particular,

the 3-dimensional character of the dynamics (due to the variation of the space advance Ω(J))

has turned the invariant curves into “surfaces” and has led to the dissolution of the outer

ones surrounding the ﬁve major islands. Furthermore, most of the chains of smaller islands

picture with ξ = 0.001 (or ω/ω0 ≃ 0.9426) in the Hamiltonian (4). Notice the dissolution of the

of Figure 1(a) have disappeared due to the new resonances caused by the presence of space

charges. To see how all this aﬀects the dynamical aperture of the beam as a function of the

tune depression ω/ω0 we now perform the following experiment:

Forming a grid of initial conditions of step size ∆x = ∆p = 0.01 within a square [−1, 1] ×

[−1, 1] about the origin (Xn = Pn = 0), we use (1) to iterate for diﬀerent ξ > 0 (or ω/ω0 < 1)
all points falling within circular rings of width ∆r = 0.01 for N = 105 and N = 106 iterations
n )1/2 = resc value, at which at least one orbit was
found to escape from the next outer ring. The results demonstrate that already at ξ = 0.001

and plot in Figure 2 the last r = (X 2

n + P 2

(ω/ω0 ≃ 0.97) our estimate of the dynamical aperture resc has fallen from 0.54 to about

0.43. In fact, it remains close to that value (rising somewhat to about 0.5) until ξ ≃ .006

(ω/ω0 ≃ 0.81), where it experiences a sudden drop to resc ≃ 0.03, and the beam is eﬀectively

destroyed. Of course, once one orbit escapes most of them quickly follow within the next

one or two circular rings. Note also that increasing the number of iterations from N = 105

9

to N = 106 does not appreciably change the results, until the sudden drop occurs.

FIG. 2: Plot of dynamical aperture “radius” resc estimates of the ﬂat beam case, resulting from

the iterations of the map (1), with frequency ω0 = 1.32, in the presence of space charges, i.e for

increasing values of ξ in (4). Note the quick decrease of the aperture value by about 20 percent,

which remains nearly the same until ξ ≃ 0.006 (ω/ω0 ≃ 0.81), when a sudden drop occurs, probably

due to the appearance of a major new resonance.

This dramatic change at ω/ω0 ≃ 0.81 is most probably due to the presence of a major

new resonance caused by the space charge perturbation.

It may be an important eﬀect,

however, since it occurs at a ξ value which is still smaller than the r2

c = 0.01 radius of the
charge core. Of course, long before this happens, already at ξ ≃ 0.0002 (or ω/ω0 ≃ 0.994),

the eﬀective aperture of the beam has been signiﬁcantly reduced by about 20 percent from

its value at ξ = 0.

Finally, let us turn to the case of the 4D map (16), describing the more realistic case

of a beam whose particles experience horizontal as well as vertical displacements from the

ideal path, see (11). For comparison purposes, we choose the same parameter values as in

our earlier papers [5, 6, 7, 8], i.e horizontal and vertical tunes qx = 0.61903, qy = 0.4152

respectively, yielding the unperturbed frequencies (17) used in the mapping equations. In

Figure 3(a), we iterate many initial conditions X(0), P1(0), Y (0), P2(0) around the origin

and plot on a X(n), P1(n) projection a picture of the dynamics, for |Y (n)| ≤ 0.04, in the

absence of space charges, i.e. with ωi = ω0i, i = 1, 2.

of the map (16), with tunes qx = 0.61903, qy = 0.4152, in the absence of space charges. Note the

presence of a large region of invariant 2D “tori” about the origin and the 6 “islands” of a stable

resonance, shown here in a cut of the 4D space, with |Y (n)| ≤ 0.04. (b) The same picture with

ξ = 0.0002 in Hamiltonian (11) (or ω1/ω01 ≃ 0.9993, ω2/ω02 ≃ 0.9985). Each initial condition is

followed for N = 104 iterations. Notice the dissolution of outer invariant curves surrounding the

origin and the disappearance of the chain of islands of (a), leading to a signiﬁcant decrease of the

beam’s dynamical aperture.

Note the region of invariant tori and a chain of 6 “islands” corresponding to a stable reso-

nance. Strictly speaking, the motion between these tori need not be bounded as 2D surfaces

do not separate 4D space and Arno’ld diﬀusion phenomena [16] could in principle carry orbits

far away from the origin. However, as has been explicitly shown for this model in [5, 6, 7],

such phenomena are extremely slow and hence a domain with radius of the order of 0.5 can

be eﬀectively considered as the dynamical aperture of the beam. Repeating this experiment

in the presence of space charges, i.e. with ξ = 0.0002 (or ω1/ω01 ≃ 0.9993, ω2/ω02 ≃ 0.9985)

in (11), we observe in Figure 3(b) that the outer invariant curves (together with the islands)

have been destroyed and the dynamical aperture of the beam has been signiﬁcantly reduced.

Studying this reduction as a function of ξ, we proceed to choose initial conditions from

11

a grid of step size 0.05, extending from -0.65 to 0.65 in all 4 directions about the origin,

represented by X(0), P1(0), Y (0), P2(0).

spherical shells of width ∆r = 0.01, we plot in Figure 4, for each ξ, the resc value of

the inner radius of the shell from which at least one orbit escapes to inﬁnity. Our results

demonstrate that the beam’s dynamical aperture steadily decreases as ξ grows. At ξ = 0.006

(or ω1/ω01 ≃ 0.98, ω2/ω02 ≃ 0.955) its radius has fallen by more than 50 percent from its
original value, while at higher perveance values the approximation ξ << r2

c no longer applies.
In fact, it is worth noting that the size of the dynamical aperture falls drastically even for

small values of ξ, as our calculations with N = 105 iterations show. For example even at

ξ = 0.0002 (or ω1/ω01 ≃ 0.9993, ω2/ω02 ≃ 0.9985) our estimate of the dynamical aperture

has dropped from 0.54 to 0.37.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

High intensity eﬀects have long been studied in connection with the so called beam-beam

interaction and were a relevant topic in the design of many hadron colliders like ISABELLE

and the SSC (see articles in [17, 18, 19]). However, the eﬀects of high currents on the

 

12

beam stability have become especially crucial only in recent times, when the design and

construction of medium energy high current accelerators has started.

We have reported in this Letter our results on the possible importance of space charge

eﬀects to the global stability of intense hadron beams, experiencing the sextupole nonlin-
earities of an array magnetic focusing elements, through which the particles pass N = 105−6

times in a typical “medium term” experiment of intense beam dynamics. We have used a

recently developed analytical approach [1] to model the space charges by a “frozen core”

distribution, valid to ﬁrst order in canonical perturbation theory. By proposing a simple ex-

ample of such a distribution, which leads to explicit and convenient formulas, we have been

able to carry out detailed numerical investigations on perturbations of 2D and 4D mapping

models, describing the dynamics of ﬂat (horizontal) and elliptic beams (with horizontal and

vertical displacements) respectively.

These charge distributions are in eﬀect periodic modulations of the tunes (and space

advance frequencies) of the motion and are therefore expected to introduce new resonances,

raising the phase space dimensionality of the dynamics. Thus, outer invariant tori of the

unperturbed case start to disappear and “island” chains of higher order resonances far from

the origin eventually drift away, leading to a signiﬁcant decrease of the region of bounded be-

tatron oscillations of the particles about their ideal path (i.e. the beam’s dynamical aperture,

or luminosity).

In our experiments, we have been able to measure this reduction of the beam’s dynamical

aperture, for several small values of the perveance parameter ξ, representing the strength of

the space charge distribution. We found that, within the range of validity of our approxima-

tions, the domain of bounded orbits decreases by a signiﬁcant percentage and hence space

charge eﬀects should be taken into consideration as they can be important for the long term

survival of the beam. In the ﬂat beam case, we observed a near total loss of the beam at

some ξ value, which is most likely caused by the onset of a major new resonance introduced

by the space charge modulations. On the other hand, in the more general case of a beam

with 2- dimensional cross section modelled by a 4- dimensional map, we also discovered a

sudden drop in the dynamical aperture, occurring already at very small tune depressions.

We, therefore, believe that space charges are important enough to merit further investi-

gation in mapping models of intense proton beams [20]. The occurrence of new low order

resonances poses, of course, a major threat to the dynamics, if the perveance parameter is

13

big enough. However, even at small values of this parameter, weak (Arnol’d) diﬀusion eﬀects

and the slow drift of high order resonances, may signiﬁcantly alter the long term picture

of the motion, after a suﬃciently great number of iterations.

It would also be useful to

compare the one turn map with the full integration of the space charge eﬀect over one beam

revolution to appreciate the validity limits of our approximation.

Indeed, since the high

computation eﬃciency of the one turn map is a key issue of this approach, an estimate of

the errors in some reference cases would contribute additional useful information in realistic

applications.

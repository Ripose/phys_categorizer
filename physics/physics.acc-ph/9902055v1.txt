Abstract

The paper is devoted to the study of the inﬂuence of crystalline lat-
tice distortions due to external excitations (acoustic vibrations, tem-
perature gradient, etc.) on the Quasicerenkov radiation. Equations
describing Quasicerenkov radiation of charged particles in distorted
crystals are derived. These equations are solved numerically. It is
shown that certain types of lattice deformations may intensify the
Quasicerenkov radiation by several times.

It is known that being in uniform linear motion a charged particle radiates
only if the Cerenkov condition is satisﬁed or the medium has space and/or time
inhomogeneities. In the case of space inhomogeneities intensity of the radiated
beam, its direction, and frequency are depended on the type and size of inhomo-
geneities. If these inhomogeneities are periodically arranged then the radiation,
with the wavelength of the range of this periodicity, may be intensiﬁed due to
the interference of the waves radiated from the diﬀerent inhomogeneities. Such
radiation takes place when a charged particle moves through a crystal. Radia-
tion emitted under the Bragg angles is formed by diﬀraction of the secondary
waves accompanying the charged particles on the crystalline lattice. It is called
Quasicerenkov radiation [3] (QCR) (or Parametric x-ray radiation [2]). The
QCR was predicted [1],[2] in 1971 and their properties have been studied on
the basis of semi classical arguments in many theoretical works (for example
see [3]). The experimental observation of QCR occurred after 1985 (see Refs
[4]-[5]). The results of this and following experiments in the main agree with the
theory. Recent works (see [6]) have revealed some disagreement of the measured
and theoretical values of the ratios of higher order radiation intensities to ﬁrst
order radiation intensity for mosaic graphite.

The existing QCR theory was developed only for perfect (dynamic theory)
and mosaic (kinematic theory) crystals that can not describe the dynamic eﬀects
in the presence of week distortions in the crystal.
In the present paper an
attempt is made to develop a new method for investigating the inﬂuence of
lattice distortions on QCR.

The QCR phenomenon is described by Maxwell’s equations, where the per-
mittivity of the medium is considered to be a periodic function of the spatial
coordinates. The Fourier-transform of the electromagnetic induction with re-
spect to the time is found to be of the form ~D = ~Ds + ~Ee, where ~Ee is the
ﬁeld of the moving charge in vacuum, and ~Ds is the scattered ﬁeld. Then the
Maxwell equations are reduced to

where χ(~r, ω) is the polarizability of the medium, ω is the radiation frequency
and for ~Ee it is easy to ﬁnd

~Ee =

where e is the particle charge, γ is the Lorentz factor, ~k = ω~v/v2, ~v is the particle
velocity, while integration is over the vectors perpendicular to the particle path
(~q ⊥ ~v). As it is seen from (2), the ﬁeld of the moving charged particle can
be interpreted as a sum of secondary waves with wave vectors ~k + ~q. When
the crystal is distorted in a way that the characteristic length of the lattice
deformations exceed many times the sizes of elementary cell then for χ(~r, ω) we
can write [9]

χ(~r, ω) =

χbexp(−i~b(~r − ~u)),

Xb

where summation is performed with respect to the reciprocal lattice vectors ~b, ~u
is the vector displacement of the elementary cell from its initial position. Taking
into account (3) it is convenient to search a solution of (1) in the form

~Dgexp(−i~kg~r + i~g~u)d~q,

where ~kg = ~k + ~q + ~g and ~Dg are slow functions of the coordinates. Substituting
(4) into (1) and using the principle of superposition, after multiplying both
sides of the equation by exp(i~kh~r + i~h~u) and integrating over the elementary
cell volume we obtain an inﬁnite system of equations

where

and ~h takes all the values of the reciprocal lattice vectors. When deriving these
equations we neglect small terms of second and higher order (i.e., the terms
containing second derivatives of the slow functions ~u and ~Dh, the production
of ﬁrst derivatives by one another, and by χh as for x-ray frequency range
|χ|˜10−6). The left-hand side of system (5) completely coincides with the Takagi
equations [9] for x-ray diﬀraction in distorted crystals. Let us consider the case,

2

when for a given frequency only two strong waves scattered in the directions ~k0
and ~kh exist. In this case only two equations remain in system (5) describing
the amplitudes ~D0 and ~Dh. After separating the radiation into the normal and
coplanar polarizations one can ﬁnd the separate systems of two equations for
every kind of polarization

where index α = σ, π indicates the polarization type (σ corresponds to the

when they are in that plane),

where ~A = ~D or ~F . To solve the problem of ﬁnding a relativistic electron’s
QCR ﬁeld it is necessary to specify boundary conditions for the system (6).
For the Laue case of orientation the boundary conditions for the two wave
approximation is

~D0(~rp) = ~Dh(~rp) = 0,

where ~rp is the radius vector of a point on the crystal entrance surface, as is no
radiation ﬁeld before the crystal. The number of γ-quanta with the energy ¯hω
emitted in the direction ~kh is

where (x, y) are the coordinates of exit surface of the crystal. Equations (6) with
the boundary conditions (7) may be analytically solved only for certain types
of distortions of crystals.
It should be mentioned that since these equations
without right-hand side are the same as for the case of x-ray diﬀraction in the
distorted crystal [9] and since the solution of inhomogeneous equations can be
built by the solutions of homogeneous part of that equations then the problem of
QCR is analytically solvable for each type of distortions for which the problem
of x-ray diﬀraction is analytically solvable. For example they may be solved
analytically in the case of quadratic deformations of crystalline lattice [8] (that
is, in the case of temperature gradient or crystal bending). In common case they
will be solved approximately by analytic or numeric methods. We have studied

cases of the crystal’s distortions described in [10]. In the ﬁrst case

).

(9)

These type of distortions are generated when a piezocrystal is excited by
an alternating voltage with the resonant frequency of the sample (the time
dependence in (9) is omitted, as the time of particle transmission trough the
crystal is much less than the period of the acoustic vibrations). In the second
case the crystal is heated on one side and is cooled on the other one, so that the
direction of the temperature gradient is perpendicular to the reﬂection planes,
and the function ~h~u has the form

In both cases the crystal is oriented by the symmetric Laue geometry when
the diﬀraction vector is parallel to the entrance surface of crystal.
In these
cases ~h~u depends only on the coordinate perpendicular to the diﬀraction vector
~h, and the equations (6) can be reduced to the system of ordinary diﬀeren-
tial equations. The calculations are carried out by the Runge-Kutta numeric
method for the parameter values according to experimental data of [10]. The
results for acoustic vibration case are presented in the Figs. Fig.1 shows the
energy or the frequency dependence of the number of radiated γ-quanta emitted
in the diﬀraction direction for various values of the amplitude of the acoustic
vibrations. Fig. 2 shows the dependence of the integral number of the emitted
QCR γ-quanta on the amplitude of the acoustic vibrations.

interplane distance).

acoustic vibration’s amplitude.

As it is seen from Figs, the QCR intensity increases several times with the
increase of the amplitude of the acoustic vibrations. For the high values of
the vibration amplitude the intensity curve goes to the saturation. The similar
results are obtained in the case of temperature gradient. These results are in
good agreement with the experimental results of [10] and [11].

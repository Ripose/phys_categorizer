Abstract

Recent theoretical and experimental studies have shown that Self-Ampliﬁed Spon-
taneous Emission Free Electron Laser (SASE FEL) with a planar undulator holds a
potential for generation of relatively strong coherent radiation at the third harmonic
of the fundamental frequency. Here we present detailed study of the nonlinear har-
monic generation in the SASE FEL obtained with time-dependent FEL simulation
code. Using similarity techniques we present universal dependencies for temporal,
spectral, and statistical properties of the odd harmonics of the radiation from SASE
FEL. In particular, we derived universal formulae for radiation power of the odd
harmonics at saturation. It was also found that coherence time at saturation falls in-
versely proportional to harmonic number, and relative spectrum bandwidth remains
constant with harmonic number.

1 Introduction

Radiation of the electron beam in the planar undulator contains rich harmonic
spectrum. This referes to both, incoherent and coherent radiation as well. Dur-
ing last years a signiﬁcant eﬀorts of researchers have been devoted for studying
the process of the higher harmonic generation in the high-gain free electron
lasers [1]-[11]. Such an interest has been mainly driven by practical needs for
prediction of the properties of X-ray free electron lasers. A fraction of a higher
harmonic content is very important for users planning experiments at X-ray
FEL facility. On the one hand, higher harmonics constitute rather harmful
background for some classes of experiments. On the other hand, higher har-
monic radiation can signiﬁcantly extend operating band of the user facility.
In both cases it is highly desirable to know properties of the hiher harmonic
radiation. Analytical techniques have been used to predict properties of the
higher harmonics for FEL ampliﬁer operating in the linear mode of operation
[8,9]. However, the most fraction of the radiation power is produced in the
nonlinear regime, and a set of assumptions needs to be accepted in order to
estimate saturation power of higher harmonics on the base of extrapolation of
analytical results. As for statistical properties, they could not be extrapolated
from linear theory at all. A lot of studies has been performed with numerical
simulation codes. These studies developed in two directions. The ﬁrst direc-
tion is investigations of higher harmonic phenomena by means of steady-state
codes [4,5,6,7]. Despite the results of these studies are applicable to externally
seeded FEL ampliﬁers, it is relevant to appreciate that they gave the ﬁrst pre-
dictions for high radiation power in higher harmonics of SASE FEL. Another
direction was an extraction of time structure for the beam bunching from
time-dependent simulation code with subsequent use of analytical formulae of
the linear theory [8]. Giving an estimate for the power, such an approach does
not allow to describe statistical properties of the output radiation.

In this paper we perform comprehensive study of the statistical properties
of the odd harmonic radiation from SASE FEL. The study is performed in
the framework of one-dimensional model with time-dependent simulation code
FAST [12,14] upgraded for simulation of higher harmonic generation. We re-
strict our study with odd harmonics produced in the SASE FEL. We omit from
consideration an eﬀect of self-consistent ampliﬁcation of the higher harmonics.
In other words, we solve only electrodynamic problem assuming that particle
motion is governed by the fundamental harmonic. The latter approximation is
valid when power in higher harmonics is much less than in the fundamental.
This does not limit practical applicability of the results: it has been shown in
earlier papers that the growth rate of higher harmonics is too small to pro-
duce visible increase of the coherent ampliﬁcation above shot noise in X-ray
FELs [8]. Under this approximation and using similarity techniques we derive
universal relations describing general properties of the odd harmonics in the

trated for the 3rd and 5th harmonic having practical importance for X-ray
FELs.

2 Basic relations

The one-dimensional model describes the ampliﬁcation of the plane electro-
magnetic wave by the electron beam in the undulator. When space charge
and energy spread eﬀects can be neglected, operation of an FEL ampliﬁer

is described in terms of the gain parameter Γ = [πj0K 2
ﬁciency parameter ρ = λwΓ/(4π), and detuning parameter ˆC = [2π/λw −
ω(1 + K 2/2)/(2cγ2)]/Γ (see,e.g. [13,14]). Here λw is undulator period, K =
eλwHw/2πmc2 is undulator parameter, γ is relativistic factor, Hw is undula-
tor ﬁeld, j0 is the beam current density, (
e) and m are charge and mass of
electron, IA = mc3/e
17 kA, and ω is frequency of electromagnetic wave.
Coupling factor Kh is given by

Kh = K(

1)(h−1)/2[J(h−1)/2(Q)

J(h+1)/2(Q)] ,

(1)

Q = K 2/[2(1 + K 2)], and K is rms undulator parameter. When describing
start-up from shot noise, one more parameters of the theory appears – number
of particles in coherence volume, Nc = I/(eρω), where I is beam current.

We do not present here general technical details of the time dependent simu-
lations, they have described previously in details [12,14]. The only add-on to
these description is particle loading tool, but it is similar to that described in
other papers (see, e.g. [15] and references therein). We note only that under
accepted approximation (particle’s dynamics is governed by the fundamental
harmonic) we can simply calculate odd harmonics from particle distribution,
and amplitude of the electric ﬁeld scales as

E(z, t)

where ah is h-th harmonic of the beam bunching. Thus, we ﬁnd that coupling
factor Kh, and time-dependent integral of the beam bunching become to be
factorized. This allows us to extract universal ratio of the power of higher
harmonics to the power of fundamental harmonic.

3 Statistical properties of the odd harmonics of the radiation from

SASE FEL

In this section we present the results of numerical studies of the operation of
the SASE FEL in the linear and nonlinear regimes. In the framework of the ac-
cepted model, the input parameter of the system is the number of cooperating
electrons Nc. Most of the statistical characteristics of the SASE FEL process
are functions of Nc only in the ﬁxed z coordinate. A typical range of the values
of Nc is 106
109 for the SASE FELs of wavelength range from X-ray up to
infrared. The numerical results, presented in this section, are calculated for
107 which is typical for a VUV FEL. It is worth mentioning
the value Nc = 3
that the dependence of the output parameters of the SASE FEL on the value
of Nc is rather weak, in fact logarithmic. Therefore, the obtained results are
pretty general and can be used for the estimation of the parameters of actual
devices with suﬃcient accuracy.

the 1st harmonic is shown in Fig 2 with a solid line. It is seen that saturation
is achieved at the undulator ˆz = 13. Saturation length is well described in
terms of the number of cooperating electrons Nc [14,16]:

One can notice that power of the higher harmonics becomes to be above the
shot noise level only in the end of linear regime. This becomes clear if one
takes into account that the shot noise level of the beam bunching is about
107
1/√Nc. We consider an example typical for VUV FEL with Nc = 3

10−4. When
which corresponds to the shot noise beam bunching a
FEL ampliﬁer operates in the linear regime, odd harmonics grow as ah

we expect from this simple physical estimation that coherent contribution
into higher harmonics can exceed the shot noise level only for the values of
the beam bunching at the fundamental harmonic a1 & 0.1, i.e. in the end

and spikes of the 3rd harmonic radiation become rather pronouncing. At this
stage, for instance, the growth rate of the higher harmonics should be propor-
tional to the harmonic number [4,5,8]. The plot of the power growth rate for
the 1st, 3rd, and 5th harmonic is shown in Fig. 4. One can see from this plot
that in practical situation for SASE FEL the growth rates of higher harmon-
ics are visibly less than those given by prediction of the linear theory. This is

stage, and the beam density modulation is not a sine-like due to nonlinear
eﬀects. The noise nature of the SASE FEL makes a big diﬀerence in the be-
havior of the growth rates with respect to preidctions given in the framework
of steady-state simulations [4,5]. Analyzing the plot for the power growth rate
we can state that in practical situation predictions of the steady-state theory
are valid only for the 3rd harmonic, but only on a short piece of undulator close
to saturation, of about one gain length. Quantitative analysis of this stage of
ampliﬁcation shows that a prediction for the relation between averaged val-

holds approximately, and is strongly violated for higher harmonics, because of
strong contribution of the shot noise. This feature of the SASE FEL has been
highlighted qualitatively in early papers [8] with analysis of simulation results
obtained with code GINGER [3]. Here we just presented more quantitative
study.

Universal functions for the ratio (Kh/K1)2 are plotted in Fig. 3. Asimptotic
values for large value of undulator parameter are: (K3/K1)2
0.22, and
(K5/K1)2
0.11. Thus, we can state that contribution of the 3rd harmonic
into the total radiation power of SASE FEL at saturation could not exceed a
level of 2%. Thus, its inﬂuence on the beam dynamics should be small. This
result justiﬁes a basic assumption used for derivation of a universal relation
(4). A contribution of the 5th harmonic into the total power at saturation
could not exceed the value of 0.3%.

Another important topic is an impact of the electron beam quality on the non-
linear harmonic generation process. In the framework of the one-dimensional
theory this eﬀect is described with the energy spread parameter ˆΛ2

T [14]:

is the rms energy spread. Thus, result given by (4) is gener-
where
alized to the case of ﬁnite energy spread with the plot presented in Fig. 5.
We see that the energy spread in the electron beam suppresses power of the

i

higher harmonics. Within practical range of ˆΛ2
T this suppression can be about
a factor of 3 for the 3rd harmonic, and about an order of magnitude for the
5th harmonic. For practical estimations one should use an eﬀective value of
the energy spread describing contribution of the energy spread and emiitance
to the longitudinal velocity spread [14]:

where γz is longitudinal relativistic factor, ǫ is beam emittance, and β is fo-
cusing beta-function. The plot in Fig. 5 covers practical range of parameters
fo X-ray FELs. The saturation length at ˆΛ2
T = 0.5 is increased by a factor of
1.5 with respect to the ”cold” beam case ˆΛ2
T = 0.

3.2 Probability distributions

The next step of our study is the behavior of the probability distribution of the
instantaneous power. In Fig. 6 we show the normalized rms deviation of the
instantaneous radiation power, σw =
, as a function of
h
the undulator length. We see that at the initial stage of SASE FEL operation
rms deviation of the instantaneous power is equal to one for all harmonics.
This is a consequence of start-up from the shot noise in the electron beam: sta-

lines correspond to the fundamental, 3rd, and 5th harmonic, respectively

tistical properties of the undulator radiation and of the radiation from SASE
FEL operating in the linear regime are governed by Gaussian statistics [14,16].
One of the important features of the Gaussian statistics is that the normal-
ized rms deviation of the instantaneous radiation power is equal to the unity.
For the fundamental harmonic statistics of the radiation becomes to be non-
Gaussian when the ampliﬁcation process enters non-linear mode [14,16]. For
the higher harmonics non-Gaussian statistics takes place when the nonlinear
harmonic generation starts to dominate above incoherent radiation (at ˆz & 8
in the present numerical example). Analytical theory of nonlinear harmonic
generation [8] predicts the value of σw ≃
4 for the third harmonic. Analysis
of the relevant curve in Fig. 6 shows that this prediction holds approximately
in a short piece of the undulator length only. As we explained above, this is
due to the fact that nonlinear harmonic generation starts to dominate above
incoherent radiation only at the values of the beam bunching at the funda-
0.1. However, at such a value of the beam bunching the
mental harmonic a1 ∼
modulation of the beam density already deviates from a sin-like shape due to
nonlinear eﬀects.

Probability density distributions for the instantaneous power of the funda-
mental and the 3rd harmonic are presented in Fig. 7. SASE radiation is a
stochastic object and at a given time it is impossible to predict the amount
of energy which ﬂows to a detector. The initial modulation of the electron
beam is deﬁned by the shot noise and has a white spectrum. The high-gain
FEL ampliﬁer cuts and ampliﬁes only a narrow frequency band of the initial
spectrum ∆ω/ω
1. In the time domain, the temporal structure of the funda-
mental harmonic radiation is chaotic with many random spikes, with a typical
duration given by the inverse width of the spectrum envelope. Even without
performing numerical simulations, we can describe some general properties of
the fundamental harmonic of the radiation from the SASE FEL operating in
the linear regime. Indeed, in this case we deal with Gaussian statistics. As a
result, the probability distribution of the instantaneous radiation intensity W
should be the negative exponential probability density distribution [14,16]:

Here one should realize clearly that the notion of instantaneous intensity refers
to a certain moment in time, and that the analysis must be performed over an
ensemble of pulses. Also, the energy in the radiation pulse E should ﬂuctuate
in accordance with the gamma distribution [14,16]:

The statistics of the high-harmonic radiation from the SASE FEL changes

signiﬁcantly with respect to the fundamental harmonic (e.g., with respect to
Gaussian statistics). It is interesting in our case to be able to determine the
probability density function of instantaneous intensity of SASE radiation after
it has been subjected to nonlinear transformation. We know the probability
density function p(W ) =
) of the fundamental intensity
−
W , and W is subjected to a transformation z = (W )n. The problem is then
to ﬁnd the probability density function p(z). It can be readily shown that this

Using this distribution we get the expression for the mean value:
Thus, the nth-harmonic radiation for the SASE FEL has an intensity level
roughly n! times larger than the corresponding steady-state case, but with
more shot-to-shot ﬂuctuations compared to the fundamental [8]. Nontrivial
behavior of the intensity of the high harmonic reﬂects the complicated nonlin-
ear transformation of the fundamental harmonic statistics. One can see that
Gaussian statistics is no longer valid. Upper plots in Fig. 7 give an illustration
to these consideration. Despite in practical example we do not have pure linear
ampliﬁcation regime, the probability density functions for the instanteneous
power follow rather well prediction (7).

i

Analysis of the probability distributions in Fig. 7 shows that in the nonlinear
regime, near the saturation point, the distributions change signiﬁcantly with
respect to the linear regime for both, the fundamental and the 3rd harmonic.
An important message is that at the saturation point the 3rd harmonic radia-
tion exhibits much more noisy behaviour (nearly negative exponential) while
stabilization of the ﬂuctuations of the fundamental harmonics takes place.

undulator length. Solid, dashed, and dotted lines correspond to the fundamental,
3rd, and 5th harmonic, respectively

g2(0), takes values smaller or larger than two, but always larger than unity.
Note that there is a simple relation between g2(0) and the normalized rms
power deviation: g2(0) = 1 + σ2
w (see Fig. 6). It is a well-known result of
statistical optics that the cases of g2(0) = 1 and g2(0) = 2 correspond to
stabilized single-mode laser radiation and to completely chaotic radiation from
a thermal source, respectively. The values of g2(0) between 1 and 2 belong
to some intermediate situation. In classical optics, a radiation source with
g2(0) < 1 cannot exist but the case of g2(0) > 2 is possible. As one can
see from Fig. 8, the latter phenomenon (known as superbunching) occurs for
higher harmonics of SASE FEL, or for fundamental one when the SASE FEL
operating in the nonlinear regime.

In Fig. 9 we present the dependence on the undulator length of the normalized
coherence time ˆτc = ρω0τc, where τc is

τc =

(9)

For the fundamental harmonic the coherence time achieves its maximal value
near the saturation point and then decreases drastically. The maximal value
of ˆτc depends on the saturation length and, therefore, on the value of the
parameter Nc. With logarithmic accuracy we haave the following expression

13

for the coherence time of the fundamental harmonic:

(ˆτc)max ≃ s

π ln Nc
18

.

One can ﬁnd from Fig. 8 that coherence time at saturation for higher harmon-
ics approximately falls inversely proprtional to the harmonic number h.

3.3.1 Spectral Characteristics

When comparing radiation spectra, it is convenient to use the normalized
spectral density, h( ˆC), deﬁned as

∞

Z−∞

d ˆCh( ˆC) = 1 .

The frequency deviation, ∆ω, from the nominal value of ωh can be recalculated
2ρωh ˆC. Since we consider the model of a long rectangular bunch,
as ∆ω =
the function h( ˆC) can be treated as the normalized spectral density of both

The temporal structures of the radiation pulses (see Fig. 1) are used for calcu-
lating the ﬁrst order time correlation function (see Fig 8). Then the radiation
spectra are reconstructed by Fourier transformation of the ﬁrst order time
correlation function. Figure 10 shows evolution of the radiation spectra of the
SASE FEL radiation from the end of the linear regime to saturation. Note that
spectrum width of the higher harmonics from SASE FEL diﬀers signiﬁcantly
from that of incoherent radiation. For the case of incoherent radiation relative
spectrum width, ∆ω/ωh scales inversely proportional to the harmonic num-
ber h [19]. One can see that situation changes dramatically for the case when
nonlenear harmonic genaration process starts to be dominant. At saturation
we ﬁnd that relative spectrum bandwidth becomes to be nearly the same for
all odd harmonics.

4 Summary

In this paper we performed detailed study of the properties of the odd har-
monic of the radiation from SASE FEL. Universal formulae for contribution
of the higher odd harmonics to the FEL power for SASE FEL operating at
saturation are obtained. In the case of cold electron beam these contributions
are functions of the undulator parameter K only. General statistical properties
of the odd harmonics of the SASE FEL operating in saturation are as follows.
Power of higher harmonics is subjected to larger ﬂuctuations than that of
the fundamental one. Probability distributions of the instantaneous power of
higher harmonics is close to the negative exponential distribution. The coher-
ence time at saturation falls inversely proportional to harmonic number, and
relative spectrum bandwidth remains constant with harmonic number.

Using calculations and mathematical modeling, we demonstrate the feasibility of constructing a synchrotron
storage ring for neutral polar molecules. The lattice is a racetrack type 3.6 m in circumference consisting of
two of 180-degree arcs, six bunchers, and two long straight sections. Each straight section contains two triplet
focusing lenses and space for beam injection and experiments. The design also includes a matched injector and
a linear decelerator. Up to 60 bunches can be loaded and simultaneously stored in the ring. The molecules are
injected at 90 m/s but the velocity of the circulating beam can be decelerated to 60 m/s after injection.

The modeling uses deuterated ammonia (14N2H3) molecules in a weak-ﬁeld seeking state. Beam that survives
400 turns (15 s), has horizontal and vertical acceptances of 35 mm-mr and 70 mm-mr respectively, and an energy
acceptance of ±2%.

INTRODUCTION

An electric ﬁeld gradient exerts a force on the dipole mo-
ment of a neutral polar molecule. The force, Fx, in the (trans-
verse) x direction is:

where W is the potential energy, in an electric ﬁeld of mag-

similar expression may be written for the force in the y direc-
tion.

It is therefore possible to accelerate (decelerate)[1, 2, 3],
deﬂect, focus, and store polar molecules. Prior to this study,
a continuous torroidal ring, without a buncher or matched
injector was suggested by Auerbach et al.[4], analyzed by
Katz[5], and Loesch and Schell [6], and recently constructed
by Crompvoets et al.[7], who captured single pulses (about
106 molecules) of deuterated ammonia (14N2H3) at 90 m/s (ki-
netic energy ≈ 9.7 K) and observed them for six turns (0.053
s).

A ring with much longer storage times that can capture and
store the high peak intensity of (the decelerated output of) a
pulsed molecular beam jet source, could increase the avail-
able ﬂux. With bunching, the energy of the stored beam can
be varied continuously and the density of the molecules var-
ied. These features make a molecular synchrotron storage ring
useful for high-resolution spectroscopy, low energy scattering
experiments, and for evaporative cooling [8, 9]. With evapo-
rative cooling, the molecules can reach ultra-low temperatures
where they may form quantum condensates.

Evaporative cooling requires: high densities to thermalize
the molecules by elastic scattering, forced evaporation of the
hottest molecules, and long storage times for many repetitions
of the cooling cycle. Bunching (and focusing) raises the den-
sity to thermalize the molecules and beam drift (and/or de-
bunching) isolates the hottest molecules for removal.

In this paper we present the results of a study showing
the feasibility of constructing a molecular synchrotron storage
ring that will capture large numbers of molecules in multiple
bunches, maintain the bunches, store the molecules for longer
than 15 seconds and vary their kinetic energy.

The paper is organized as follows: In section II we dis-
cuss the lattice, the choice of molecular state, the necessity of
avoiding regions of very weak electric ﬁeld, and the dynam-
ics calculations. In section III we describe the performance
of the synchrotron storage ring, including the dynamic aper-
ture, operating parameters, the effect of gravity, bunching and
deceleration, and collisional losses. Finally, in section IV we
evaluate the overall performance of the storage ring by adding
a molecular beam source, a linear decelerator, and an injection
system.

II. STORAGE RING DESIGN

A. Lattice

Many different designs and placements of the elements
were considered and analyzed. Our resulting design (Fig.1)
is a racetrack conﬁguration consisting of two of 180-degree
arcs, 4 triplets of focusing lenses, six bunchers placed in re-
gions having low horizontal dispersion, an injector for loading
up to 60 bunches into the ring, space in the long straight sec-
tions for an extractor (for example a mirror image of the injec-
tor), and for experiments or evaporative cooling. The lengths
of the elements and drift distances between them are listed in
Table I. The strong combined horizontal and vertical focus-
ing in the bend sections makes the ring very compact. The

triplet of straight-lens electrodes then transforms the beam to
a wider, more collimated beam that can traverse the 32-cm-
long straight section as shown in Fig. 2(a). The large varia-
tion of focusing strength is apparent in Fig. 2(b), the plot of
the focusing parameters b x and b y around the ring.

The horizontal betatron phase advance in the 180-degree
bending region has been made equal to 4p
in order to have
zero dispersion at the bunching electrode, as shown in Fig. 3.
The very low dispersion at the bunching electrodes prevents
the development of strong synchro-betatron coupling and pre-
serves the momentum acceptance.

cause they had been previously used by Crompvoets et al.[7],
and because the focusing properties of weak-ﬁeld seeking
states make the design and feasability assessment easier and
the ring more compact.

Molecules in weak-ﬁeld seeking states (molecules whose
potential energy increases in an electric ﬁeld) can be fo-
cused simultaneously in both transverse directions, whereas
molecules in strong-ﬁeld seeking states can be focused in only
one transverse direction while defocusing in the other trans-
verse direction.

Fringe ﬁelds seen by the molecules upon entering and exit-
ing the bending, focusing, and bunching elements will also ex-
ert transverse forces on the molecules. A molecule in a weak-
ﬁeld seeking state traveling in the z direction will experience
a net focusing effect in the vertical (y) direction upon entering
or exiting an electric ﬁeld produced by horizontal (x, z) plane
parallel electrodes. A molecule in a strong-ﬁeld seeking state
will defocus.

Many different molecules and kinetic energies could be
used for our feasibility study. We selected 90 m/s 14N2H3
molecules in the weak-ﬁeld seeking upper-inversion level

Except for the rotational state J = 0 (which is always strong
ﬁeld seeking), each rotational state, J, contains M components
which are partially or completely degenerate in zero electric

ﬁeld. The different |M| states (or M states as in Fig. 4) have
different Stark shifts and hence experience different forces
in an electric ﬁeld gradient.
If the molecules in a ring re-
peatedly enter regions of weak and direction-changing elec-
tric ﬁelds, transitions between the different M components
will take place (Majorana transitions), leading to a loss of the
molecules[11, 12, 13]. Our method of avoiding this problem
is described below.

C. Avoiding weak-ﬁeld regions

In the bend sections, which use electrodes with zero electric
ﬁeld near their center, the centripetal force keeps the trajectory
of molecules in a strong electric ﬁeld at the inner side of that
zero (Fig. 5c). And, as did Crompvoets et al.[7], we take
advantage of the combined horizontal and vertical focusing.

Focusing lenses in the straight sections (Fig. 5a,b) are sex-
tupolar with a dipole ﬁeld added to avoid zero ﬁeld. The mul-
tipole coefﬁcients of the electrodes, their gaps, and electric
ﬁeld strengths on orbit, are listed in Table II. With the added
dipole ﬁeld, these lenses focus in only one transverse direction
while defocusing in the other and are used in an alternating-

gradient sequence [14]. To prevent rapid changes in elec-
tric ﬁeld direction, the ﬁeld direction, at the molecule’s orbit
throughout the ring, is vertical and remains unchanging in po-
larity (Fig. 6). This results in having some concave and some
convex lenses.

In the straight sections, away from focusing ﬁelds, we add a
weak bias ﬁeld (about one kV/m for the drift spaces) to main-
tain the quantization axis[12].

D. Dynamics calculation

The force on a molecule in one direction is given by Eq.
1. The basic formulas for motions of the molecules are de-
rived analytically without linearization. Then the beam optics
and dynamics are numerically calculated and optimized by us-
ing a modiﬁed version of the program Goemon[15] that was
originally developed for relativistic charged particles. The
molecules were numerically tracked through the synchrotron
for 400 turns (15 s) to determine the beam’s dynamic stability.
The numerical integration was done in the time domain be-
cause the speed of a molecule varies as a function of the elec-
tric ﬁeld. The overall dimension of the lattice is chosen to
balance easily attainable electric ﬁelds and high transverse ac-
ceptance with compact (desk top) size.

1. Potential energy

The potential energy, W, in an electric ﬁeld, of the |J, K >=
|1, 1 > level of 14N2H3 (Fig. 4) is given, in units of Joules

rately, and are described in section II D 3.

3. Fringing ﬁelds

To evaluate the transverse vertical focusing forces in the
fringing regions of the elements, a two - dimensional numer-
ical calculation, using the geometries of the electrodes, was
carried out to ﬁnd the electric ﬁeld as a function of z on the
midplane. The magnitude of the fringe ﬁelds are shown in Fig.
6. The focusing action was then calculated analytically from
the derivatives of this ﬁeld, evaluated as equivalent thin lenses
at the ends of the focusing, bending, and bunching electrodes,
and included in the calculation of trajectories around the ring.

III. SYNCHROTRON PERFORMANCE

A. Dynamic aperture

The survival of molecules, tracked through 400 turns, is cal-
culated to determine the usable dynamic apertures, ax and ay.
Fig. 7 shows a scatter plot of the starting coordinates x and
y at center of the straight section of those molecules that sur-
vive the 400 turns. From these we calculate the acceptances,
e , as 1/p
times the areas in displacement-angle phase space,
e = a2/b
. The dynamic apertures, values of beta at center of
straight section, and acceptances are given in Table III. In Ta-
ble III the circulation period is 38 ms whereas 3.357/90=37.3
ms, reﬂecting the 3% to 4% reduction in velocity when the
molecules enter the electric ﬁelds.

The dynamic aperture of off-momentum molecules deter-
mines the momentum acceptance. Fig. 8 shows the effect
of momentum on the dynamic aperture, and indicates an ac-
ceptance of about -3% to +1.7%. We shall see later that this
reduces to about ±2% when the bunchers are operating.

The betatron tunes, as a function of momentum, are found
by tracking the motions of a molecule over 512 turns. The

B. Effect of gravity

The effect of gravity is visible in the orbit because the ve-
locity of the beam is low. The vertical phase advance of 4p
(same as the horizontal phase advance), is favorable in reduc-
ing the effect of the gravity force on the vertical closed orbit.
Fig. 9 shows the vertical closed-orbit displacement (COD)
due to gravity. It ranges from -0.13 mm to 0.09 mm and is
small enough to be neglected in the case of linear optics calcu-
lations. In the case of dynamic aperture calculations we have
conﬁrmed that gravity changes only the details of the dynamic
aperture at its edges and does not affect its core portion (Fig.
7).

C. Bunching and deceleration

Bunching action is provided by six sets of parallel-plate
electrodes, each 20 mm in length with 10 mm half-gap, placed
in low dispersion regions around the ring (Fig.1, 3). The volt-
age on the plates is pulsed in a triangular waveform that pro-
duces a maximum electric ﬁeld of 1.0 MV/m for on-energy
molecules. Each buncher is synchronized to the on-energy
molecules (Fig. 10) so that the energy lost upon entering the
buncher is matched by the energy gained upon exit. A higher-
energy molecule reaches the buncher at an earlier time when
electric ﬁeld gradient is higher upon entrance and lower upon
exit, resulting in a net energy reduction for a molecule in a
weak-ﬁeld seeking state.

The buncher frequency is 1.58 kHz and allows 60 bunches
around the ring, spaced 56 mm apart. To prevent Majorana
transitions the voltage is biased to avoid negative ﬁelds. The
rate of change of the electric ﬁeld in the bunchers can be made
as large as about 7 GVm−1s−1. The synchrotron tune is pro-
portional to the square root of the rate of change and is 0.92 at
our reference value of 7 GVm−1s−1.

The lattice is optimized for a nominal velocity of 90 m/sec.
After stacking at this velocity, the beam can be decelerated by
synchronously changing the electrode and buncher settings.
This provides an opportunity to scan the velocity during an
experiment. The betatron tunes stay constant but the straight
section becomes dispersive. At 63 m/sec, the horizontal trans-
verse acceptance reduces from 35 to 13 mm-mrad and the mo-

seeking state in electrostatic traps. They ﬁnd that the loss rates
can be signiﬁcant, in some cases precluding successful evap-
orative cooling, and are inﬂuenced both by the electric ﬁelds
and the size of the electric dipole moment.

Thus, the use of a synchrotron storage ring with high den-
sities of molecules in a weak-ﬁeld seeking state will need to
confront this issue. Obviously, the alternative would be to use
molecules in the strong-ﬁeld seeking rotational ground (J = 0)
state. A synchrotron storage ring for molecules in the J = 0
state will be discussed in a future paper.

IV. SYNCHROTRON STORAGE RING SYSTEM

The overall performance of a molecular synchrotron stor-
age ring also depends upon the beam delivered by the source,
decelerator and injection line. To model performance and de-
termine the stored beam from the complete system we also
modeled a decelerator, injector and source.

A. Linear decelerator

Slow molecules, suitable for injection into a storage ring,
can be produced by time-varying electric ﬁeld gradient de-
celeration, by mechanical cancellation of the molecular beam
velocity[20], and possibly by buffer-gas cooling[21] (without
magnetic trapping). Time-varying electric ﬁeld gradient de-
celeration is the easiest of these for us to model and to match
to the storage ring. It has been used by Bethlem et al. [22, 23]
and Crompvoets et al. [7] to decelerate 14N2H3.

Our model linear decelerator takes the 310 m/s (115 K ki-
netic energy) output of a 14N2H3 - seeded xenon pulsed-jet
source (room temperature reservoir) and decelerates it to 90
m/s (9.75 K kinetic energy). The number of electrodes is set
by the decrease in kinetic energy in each electrode (equal to
the change in potential energy of the molecule entering the
electric ﬁeld). We use 79 decelerating electrodes, decreasing
in length from 48 mm to 8.75 mm effective length to keep
the transit time of the molecules constant through each elec-
trode. We choose the overall length of the decelerator, 3.4 m,
comparable to the 3.36 m circumference of the storage ring,
to balance high velocity acceptance with compact size.

The electric ﬁeld is nearly a square wave 158 µs long with
a repetition rate of 3.16 kHz and the maximum electric ﬁeld is
8 MV/m in a 1.75 mm half-gap and is the same for all decel-

D. Collisional losses

So far, we have only examined storage ring losses associ-
ated with the limits of the dynamic aperture and momentum
acceptance of the lattice. A real storage ring will also have
losses due to elastic and inelastic scattering of the molecules.
Scattering by room-temperature background gasses is the ma-
jor elastic scattering contribution and of the gasses likely to be
present in the ring, xenon and ammonia have the largest scat-
tering coefﬁcients. Assuming hard sphere binary collisions
between the 14N2H3 molecules and 300 K xenon (leaking in
from the source), the mean time between collisions is 15s at a
(xenon) pressure of 1 × 10−7 Pa (7.5 × 10−10 Torr), where we
have used the equations and collision diameter in Ref.[17].

For inelastic scattering between the 14N2H3 molecules,
their relative kinetic energy spread of about ± 0.4 K (±5.5 ×
10−24J) is small enough to prevent any signiﬁcant excitation
to higher rotational states. A molecule can however collision-
ally relax to a strong-ﬁeld seeking state, causing it to be lost
from the storage ring [7]. Bohn [18] and Kajita [19] have cal-
culated inelastic collision rates for molecules in a weak-ﬁeld

erating electrodes. After the molecules enter the electric ﬁeld
it drops to nearly zero so that the molecules that exit the elec-
trode must relinquish kinetic energy to enter the ﬁeld in the
next set of electrodes. This is done either by having succes-
sive electrodes 180 degrees out of phase or by using only ev-
ery other bunch. The electric ﬁeld does not return completely
to zero and the horizontal focusing elements (see below) have
their electric ﬁeld in the same direction as the decelerating
electrodes to minimize Majorana transitions.

Bunching, as the molecules decelerate, is accomplished by
having the electric ﬁeld (in each bunching electrode) decrease,
linearly over the 158 µs from 8 MV/m to 7.76 MV/m so that
the fastest molecules, arriving early, receive the most decel-
eration. This results in a ±1% momentum spread at 90 m/s
which falls within the momentum acceptance of the storage
ring.

The spacing between individual decelerating electrodes re-
mains constant. This ﬁxes the fringe ﬁeld which provides
vertical focusing. The decelerating electrodes are grouped
in sets of four as shown in Fig. 12. After each quadruplet
of decelerating electrodes is placed a horizontal focusing ele-
ment with length appropriate to keep the molecules in phase
with the next decelerating quadruplet. (One section has only
three decelerating electrodes.) The 20 focusing elements all
have the same ﬁeld but their focusing strength increases as
the molecules slow. The lattice is, in the vertical direction,
FFFFD and in the horizontal direction OOOOF. The overall
length of the decelerator is 3.4 m.

Upon exit from the decelerator, bunches are 7 mm long with
a vertical and horizontal half-width of 1.30 mm and 1.61 mm,
respectively. The vertical and horizontal betas are: b v = 56.3
mm and b h = 86.7 mm corresponding to vertical and hori-
zontal emittances both of 30 mm-mr. Being less than the 71
mm-mr and 35 mm-mr vertical and horizontal acceptances of
the synchrotron storage ring, this sets the overall transverse
acceptance of the entire system.

B.

Injector

A bunched beam of molecules is injected onto the closed or-
bit of the synchrotron at the downstream end of a straight sec-
tion. Starting at the exit of the decelerator, this beam is guided
along a trajectory by electric ﬁelds that focus transversely and

transform its size and divergence to match the vertical and
horizontal acceptances of the storage ring.

The last element must be a pulsed deﬂecting electrode that
turns off after the bunch or bunches have entered. Several
different injection protocols are available: a string of 158 µs
pulses can be injected into the ring in less than the circulation
period of 38 ms, or single bunches may be ﬁlled at any time by
switching the pulsed deﬂecting electrode during the interval
between bunches.

The injector guide ﬁeld consists of two bending sectors,
each an arc of about p /8 rad, arranged as shown in Fig.1. In
each bending sector the ﬁeld is conﬁgured to provide equal
horizontal and vertical focusing. The phase advance of trans-
verse motion is near p /2 in a sector; thus, it exchanges an-
gle for displacement and changes the ratio of angle to dis-
placement. Focusing strengths are adjusted to provide the
required match between injecting beam and ring acceptance.
The boundaries of the beam phase space are shown in Fig.13.
It was possible to choose the ﬁrst sector to have radius and
strength equal to that of the bend in the storage ring. The sec-
ond sector must have larger aperture and radius and it must
be pulsed to zero at the end of injection. Parameters of the
injector guide ﬁeld are shown in Table IV. The sum of the
two inverse curves was made near zero so that the line of the
decelerator is about parallel to the straight section of the syn-
chrotron storage ring.

C. Source and intensity

To estimate the number of molecules that can be deceler-
ated, injected, and stored, we assume 14N2H3 source condi-
tions similar to those reported by Crompvoets et al.[7] and by
Bethlem et al.[23]: a pulsed jet source of 0.8% 14N2H3 seeded
in 152 kPa (1140 Torr) of xenon (reservoir temperature 300
K) exiting through a circular 0.80 mm dia. oriﬁce into vac-
uum. Following Crompvoets et al. [7], we assume that 15% of
the molecules entering the decelerator are in the desired state.
From the formulas in Miller[24], we ﬁnd a ﬂux of 4.4 × 1018
14N2H3 molecules sr−1s−1 in the desired M state.

The decelerator’s transverse emittance of ±30 mm-mr and
momentum spread of ±1% at 90 m/s set a transverse accep-
tance from the 310 m/s jet source beam of ±9 mm-mr and mo-
mentum spread of ±0.29%. If we assume an initial Gaussian
velocity distribution with a mean of 310 m/s and a standard
deviation of ±20%, approximately 1.1 % of the molecules
from the jet source fall within our decelerator momentum ac-

ceptance. With a pulse length of 158 µs, the intensity of the
decelerated beam is roughly 6 × 108 molecules/pulse.

The horizontal acceptance of the storage ring matches the
emittance of the decelerator and the vertical acceptance and
momentum acceptance of the storage ring is about twice the
emittance of the injected beam, so all 6 × 108 molecules/pulse
should be captured and stored in a single bunch. If all sixty
bunches are ﬁlled (over multiple turns) the total stored beam
is 3.6 × 1010 molecules and the circulating ﬂux is 9.5 × 1011
molecules/s.

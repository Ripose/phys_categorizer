ing in a bent crystal with variable curvature. The general form of parabolic equation

1 Introduction

The parabolic equation was introduced by Leontovich and Fock [1] to de-
scribe the scattering of the wave in a cone centered on a direction of wave
propagation. Lervig, Lindhard and Nielsen [2] tried to use the similar time de-
pendent Schrodinger equation for quantum treatment the directional eﬀects
of energetic charged particles in the crystals. The work [2] indicated that an
asymptotic expansion of the wave equation with large parameter p
1 (p
- the incident momentum of particle, R - the atomic screen radius) should not
be done in the direction of p, but in the direction of crystal axes (planes), which
is slightly diﬀerent from the direction of the particle. The work [3] shown that
accurate calculations of potential scattering in the ﬁeld of a straight atomic
chain can be done as a double asymptotic expansion in terms of two large pa-
rameters of the scattering: the length of the atomic chain Lx/R
1 and the
component of the incident momentum of particle along the chain px ∗
1.
It is important to note [3,4] that this double expansion gives the parabolic
equation as well as the model of continuum potential which is central idea
of channeling eﬀect. The expansion along the axis of symmetry is the major
diﬀerence between original parabolic equation [1] and its applications for the

scattering in the crystals. The parabolic equation method is also more general
than sudden collision approximation [5] or so called eikonal-type approxima-
tions [6,7], and semi-classical corrections to the eikonal scattering amplitude
can be derived from it.

In this report we receive the parabolic equations using the symmetry of the
crystals described by orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system. On local level,
such systems looks as Cartesian coordinate systems. However, there is a diﬀer-
ence between the standard parabolic equation [1] and the parabolic equations
in curvilinear coordinate systems considered here.

2 Parabolic equations in cylindrical symmetry

The parabolic approximation allows to construct a family of solutions to the
Schrodinger wave equation which are close to the plane wave along some di-
rection. If the potential of scattering U has a spherical symmetry, the only
possible direction of expansion is the direction of incidence ~p of the particle.
Denoting this direction as x, the wave function Ψ satisfying to the stationary
Schrodinger equation

V )Ψ = 0,

−

and can be presented as

Ψ = exp(ipx)Φ(~r),

where V = 2MU, M is the mass of particle (~ = c = 1), Φ(~r is very slowly
varying in the direction x function in comparison to the exp(ipx). Substitution
of Eq. (2) into (1) and neglecting of the term ∂2Φ/∂x2 yields a well known
parabolic equation [1,8]

2ip ∂Φ/∂x + (∆⊥

V )Φ = 0,

−

with transverse Laplacian ∆⊥ = ∂2/∂y2 + ∂2/∂z2. When the scattering is
studied on potential centers which constitute a straight atomic chain (or
plane), and the momentum of particle is not parallel to the axis x of chain,
~p~r = pxx + ~p⊥~r⊥ , the the wave function Ψ should reﬂect the translation
symmetry along the direction of the chain

Ψ = exp(ipxx)Φ(~r).

Now we turn to the parabolic equation for bent atomic chain. First, consider a
circlular bent with a constant curvature k = 1/Rl and parametric presentation
of a chain along this circle x = Rl sin(φ), y = Rl(cos(φ)
1), z = z (see
Fig. 1(a)). If we take a cylindrical coordinate system (ρ, φ, z), then there are
the conjugate momentums of free particle (pρ, pφ, pz), such that

−

~p~r = pρρ + pφφ + pzz.

Based on this presentation of phase, we can derive three diﬀerent parabolic
equations, each one for the propagation of the particle along one curvilinear
coordinate when two others are constants. Parabolic equation along the axis
z lookes the same as 5, so we consider two cases in Fig. 1. For the motion
Fig. 1(a) the wave function can be in the form

Ψ = exp(ipφφ)Φ(ρ, φ, z).

step is to neglect the small term 1/ρ2∂2Φ/∂φ2 in range of high energies, and
we have the ﬁnal result

In the second case (Fig. 1(b)), the wave function can be written as

and doing the similar procedure, one can get the parabolic equation for the

However, using the assumption pρρ

be disregarded in Eq.(12) and parabolic equation becomes the same as Eq.(5)
for the straight chain.

3 Parabolic equations in orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system

Now we derive the general form the parabolic equation. Assume an atomic
chain is located along the curvilinear axis q1 of some orthogonal curvilinear
coordinate system (q1, q2, q3). The Laplacian in this coordinate system can be
written in the form

∆ =

where hi = √gii is Lame coeﬃcients; gij is metric tensor of the space, gij = 0
= j. For example, in the cylindrical coordinate system considered in
for i
Sec.2 h1 = 1, h2 = ρ, h3 = 1 and , in the elliptic coordinate system x =
Rl cos(q2) cosh(q1), y = Rl sin(q2) cosh(q1), z = q3 Lame coeﬃcients are h1 =
cos(q1)2, h3 = 1 . The wave function may be presented
h2 = Rl
as (obviously, due to symmetry there is no diﬀerence what coordinate qi can
q
be chosen)

cosh(q1)2

−

Ψ = exp(ipq1q1)Φ(q1, q2, q3).

The possibility of such presentation is based on relation between direct (q1, q2, q3)
and dual(pq1, pq2, pq3) spaces

Acting in the same manner as in Sec. 2 , we can derive three diﬀerent parabolic
equations, each one for propagation of the particle along one curvilinear co-
ordinate when two others are constants. We proceed with the wave function
(14). Substituting (14) in wave equation (1) with Laplacian (13), the accurate
equation for reduced wave function Φ can be written as

This is the most general form of parabolic equation, and all results received
in Sec.2 can easily be deduced from it. Indeed, in Cartesian coordinates q1 =
x, q2 = y, q3 = z and h1 = h2 = h3 = 1, now from (18) it follows the Eq.(5). In
cylindrical coordinates q1 = ρ, q2 = φ, q3 = z and h1 = 1, h2 = ρ, h3 = 1. From
(18) it follows the Eq.(12). Parabolic equations along the other axes q2, q3 look
exactly the same as (18) with cyclic substitution of indices. For example, the
parabolic equation along the axis q2 will have the form

Now it is straightforward to see that in cylindrical coordinates Eq.(19) has the
form of the Eq.(10).

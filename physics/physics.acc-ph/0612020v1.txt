ABSTRACT

We report the results of theoretical and numerical analysis of the crystalline undulators planned to be used in the
experiments which are the part of the ongoing PECU project.1 The goal of such an analysis was to deﬁne the
parameters (diﬀerent from those pre-set by the experimental setup) of the undulators which ensure the highest
yield of photons of speciﬁed energies. The calculations were performed for 0.6 and 10 GeV positrons channeling
through periodically bent Si and Si1−xGex crystals.

Keywords: crystalline undulator, dechanneling, photon attenuation

1. INTRODUCTION

In this paper we report the results of calculations of the parameters of the crystalline undulators (diﬀerent from
those pre-set by the experimental setup, see Section 2) and the characteristics of the undulator radiation for the
positron energies, the types and lengths of the crystals, and the photon energies which will be available in the
experiments planned to be carried out within the PECU project.1

A periodically bent crystal together with a bunch of ultra-relativistic charged particles which undergo planar
channeling constitute a crystalline undulator, see Fig. 1. In such a system there appears, in addition to the
well-known channeling radiation, the undulator type radiation which is due to the periodic motion of channeling
particles which follow the bending of the crystallographic planes.2, 3 The intensity and characteristic frequencies
of this radiation can be varied by changing the beam energy and the parameters of the bending. In the cited papers
as well as in subsequent publications (see the review Ref. 4 and the references therein) we proved a feasibility
to create a short-wave crystalline undulator that will emit high-intensity, highly monochromatic radiation when
pulses of ultra-relativistic positrons are passed through its channels.5 A number of corresponding novel numerical
results were presented to illustrate the developed theory, including, in particular, the calculation of the spectral
and angular characteristics of the new type of radiation. Later the importance of the novel concept of a crystalline
undulator has been realized by other authors.

The scheme presented in Fig. 1 leads also to the possibility of generating a stimulated emission of a free-
electron laser type. The estimates carried out in Refs. 3, 4, 7 showed that it is feasible to consider emission
stimulation within the range of photon energies 10 . . . 104 keV (a Gamma-laser). It was demonstrated6 also that
the brilliance of radiation from a positron-based undulator in the energy range from hundreds of keV up to tens
of MeV is comparable to that of conventional light sources (both existing and proposed) operating for much
lower photon energies.

Once the feasibility of a positron-based crystalline undulator had been established theoretically, it has become
clear that further joint theoretical and experimental eﬀorts are needed to actually create this powerful source of
radiation, the parameters of which can be easily tuned by varying the energy of the beam particles, by using
diﬀerent crystals and by changing the parameters of the crystal bending. All this constitute a complex, highly

interdisciplinary, absolutely new and very promising ﬁeld of research. Constructing such a device is an extremely
challenging task, to realize which it is necessary to bring together research groups from various ﬁelds of expertise.
Such a collaboration, created recently, has got the support from the European Commission within the framework
of the PECU project.1

The PECU project aims to develop in full the theory of of spontaneous and stimulated emission of radiation
in crystalline undulator, to use both theory and experiment to investigate the best methods and materials for
constructing the crystals, to carry out the experiments with the crystalline undulators. The European researchers,
involved in the project, are among the world leaders in various ﬁelds of research. Theoretical support of the
activities within the project will be carried out by researches from Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies and
Institut f¨ur Theoretische Physik (Univestit¨at Frankfurt am Main), whose pioneering works initiated the worldwide
activity in the ﬁeld. The key role in channeling experiments will be played by scientists from the Aarhus University
(Denmark), who have a long-term experience in beam physics and studying the channeling phenomenon. Also,
this institution has the necessary facilities to construct periodically bent crystalline structures. The group from
Mainz University (Germany) will carry out experiments on testing periodically bent structures. The group
from Imperial College (the UK) will contribute its expertise in the free-electron laser physics. The experiments
with crystalline undulators will be performed at CERN and INFN, where the positron beams, satisfying all the
necessary criteria, are available.

For further referencing, let us mention the necessary conditions, which must be met in order to treat a

crystalline undulator as a feasible scheme for devising a new source of electromagnetic radiation2–4:

Below we present a short description of the physics lying behind these conditions.

Stable channeling of an ultra-relativistic positron in a periodically bent channel is possible if the maximum
centrifugal force Fcf is less than the maximal interplanar force U ′
max < 1. Expressing Fcf
through the energy ε of the projectile, the period and amplitude of the bending one formulates this condition as
it is written in (1).

max, i.e. C = Fcf /U ′

The operation of a crystalline undulator should be considered in the large-amplitude regime. Omitting the
discussion (see Ref. 2–4), we note that the limit a/d > 1 accompanied by the condition C
1 is mostly
advantageous, since in this case the characteristic frequencies of undulator and channeling radiation (see, e.g.,
Ref. 8) are well separated, so that the latter does not aﬀect the parameters of the former, whereas the intensity
of undulator radiation becomes comparable or higher than that of the channeling one.2, 3, 9 A strong inequality
λ, resulting in elastic deformation of the crystal, leads to moderate values of the undulator parameter

of the synchrotron one.10

≪

The term ’undulator’ implies that the number of periods N = L/λ is large (here L denotes the crystal length).
In this case the emitted radiation bears the features of the undulator one, i.e. narrow, well-separated peaks, -
harmonics, in spectral-angular distribution. Therefore, the stronger the third inequality is the more pronounced
the features are.

The essential diﬀerence between a crystalline undulator and a conventional one, based on the action of a
magnetic (or electric) ﬁeld,11 is that in the latter the beams of particles and photons move in vacuum whereas
in the former – in a crystalline medium, where they are aﬀected by the dechanneling and the photon attenuation.
The dechanneling eﬀect stands for a gradual increase in the transverse energy of a channeled particle due to
inelastic collisions with the crystal constituents.12 At some point the particle gains a transverse energy higher
than the planar potential barrier and leaves the channel. The average interval for a particle to penetrate into a
crystal until it dechannels is called the dechanneling length, Ld. In a straight channel this quantity depends on
the crystal, on the energy and the type of a projectile. In a periodically bent channel there appears an additional
dependence on the parameter C. The intensity of the photon ﬂux, which propagates through a crystal, decreases
due to the processes of absorption and scattering. The interval within which the intensity decreases by a factor
of e is called the attenuation length, La(ω). This quantity is tabulated for a number of elements and for a wide
range of photon frequencies (see, e.g., Ref. 13). The forth condition in (1) takes into account severe limitation
of the allowed values of the length L of a crystalline undulator due to the dechanneling and the attenuation.

≫

Finally, let us comment on the last condition in (1). For suﬃciently large photon energies (ω & 102 keV)
the restriction due to the attenuation becomes less severe than due to the dechanneling eﬀect.2–4 Then, Ld(C)
introduces an upper limit on the length of a crystalline undulator. Indeed, it was demonstrated6, 14 that in the
Ld the intensity of radiation is not deﬁned by the expected number of undulator periods L/λ but rather
limit L
ε,10, 15, 16
is formed in the undulator of the eﬀective length
it seems natural that to increase the eﬀective length one can consider higher energies. However, at this point
another limitation manifests itself.2, 3, 17 The coherence of an undulator radiation is only possible when the
energy loss ∆ε of the particle during its passage through the undulator is small, ∆ε
ε. This statement
together with the fact, that for an ultra-relativistic projectile ∆ε is mainly due to the photon emission,10 leads
to the conclusion that L must be much smaller than the radiation length Lr, - the distance over which a particle
converts its energy into radiation.

For a positron-based crystalline undulator a thorough analysis of the system (1) was carried out for the ﬁrst
time in Refs. 2–4, 6, 9, 17. For a number of crystals the ranges of ε, a, λ and ω were established within which
the operation of the crystalline undulator is possible. These ranges include ε = 0.5 . . . 10 GeV, a/d = 101 . . . 102,
C = 0.01 . . . 0.2, ω & 10 keV and are common for all the investigated crystals. The importance of exactly this
regime of operation of the positron-based crystalline undulator was later realized by other authors.18

2. EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS

At the initial stage of the PECU project1 two experiments on the measurement of the photon yield from positron-
based crystalline undulators are planned to be carried out at CERN and INFN laboratories. Due to the experi-
mental conditions and methods of preparations of periodically bent crystalline structures several parameters of
the crystalline undulator are pre-set. These parameters include19:

•

The positron beam energy is ﬁxed at ε = 600 MeV in the INFN experiment and at ε = 10 GeV in the
CERN one.

•

The crystalline undulators are to be produced by two methods. The ﬁrst method utilizes the technology
of growing Si1−xGex structures. In this case, by varying the Ge content x one can obtain periodically
bent crystalline structure.20, 21 The technological restrictions imposed by this method on the crystalline
undulator length is that L
The periodic bending can also be achieved by making regularly spaced grooves on the crystal surface.18 In
this case, the crystalline planes in the vicinity of the defects become periodically bent. For the experiment
within PECU a number of Si crystals prepared by laser-ablation method are available.19, 22 The length of
such crystalline undulators is L = 2 or 4 mm, and the period of the structure is 50, 100 and 200 µm.

A severe restriction on the emitted photon energy is anticipated in the INFN experiment where the exper-
imental setup allows to register only ~ω = 20 keV photons.

Theoretical support for these experiments implied to provide an initial analysis of other parameters which
can be varied in the crystalline undulators described above, and, as a ﬁnal result, to establish the ranges of
parameters which lead to the highest yield of the undulator radiation. Partly, the results of such analysis we
present in sections 3.2 and 3.3 for the following two cases (labeled below in the paper as ’Undulator 1’ and
’Undulator 2’):

3. RESULTS OF CALCULATION

For the sake of reference let us outline the basic formulae which we used in our calculations. A more detailed
description of the formalism one can ﬁnd in Refs. 3, 4, 6, 14.

The spectral distribution of the energy E of radiation emitted in a crystalline undulator in the forward

direction (i.e., θ = 0 with respect to the z axis, see Fig. 1) can be written in the following form6:

where ω0 = 2πc/λ is the undulator frequency. The integer values of η, i.e. η = n = 1, 2, 3 . . . deﬁne the
frequencies ωn of harmonics. The factor sin2 ηπ/2 on the right-hand side of (4) ensures that only odd harmonics
are emitted in the forward direction. We also note that in this case the Anger’s functions J(η±1)/2 (zη) reduce to
the Bessel functions J(η±1)/2 (nz) (e.g., Ref. 23), so that the expression in the square brackets acquires the form
known in the theory of undulator radiation.10, 24

A peculiar feature of the undulator radiation, which clearly distinguishes it from other types of electromagnetic
radiation by a charge moving in external ﬁelds, is that for each value of the emission angle (and, in particular, for
θ = 0) the spectral distribution consists of a set of narrow and equally spaced peaks corresponding to diﬀerent
harmonics. In an ideal undulator (i.e., in which positrons and photons propagate in vacuum) the peak intensity
is proportional to the squared number of periods. Formally, it follows from the fact that d3E is proportional
which behaves as N 2 for η = n.10, 24 This factor reﬂects the constructive
to DN (η)
interference of radiation emitted from each of the undulator periods and is typical for any system which contains
N coherent emitters. Consequently, in an ideal undulator one can, in principle, increase unrestrictedly the

radiated intensity by increasing of the undulator length L which, for a ﬁxed λ, deﬁnes the number of undulator
periods.

The situation is diﬀerent for a crystalline undulator, where the number of channeling particles and the
number of photons which can emerge from the crystal decrease with the growth of L. In Ref. 6, 14 we analyzed
quantitatively the inﬂuence of the dechanneling and the photon attenuation on the spectral-angular distribution.
The main result of these studies reads that the peak intensity of the radiation is no longer proportional to N 2.
Omitting the discussion, which can be found in the cited papers, we mention that in a crystalline undulator
the factor DN (η) must be substituted with
DN (η), which depends not only on N and η but also on the ratios
κd = L/Ld(C) and κa = L/La(ω). A convenient formula for

3.2. Numerical results for ’Undulator 1’.

The goal of the quantitative analysis of the undulator with ﬁxed values of ε, L and ω (see eq. (2)) was to establish
the ranges of other parameters (these include, in particular, the number of periods N , the bending amplitude
a, and the parameter C) which ensure the largest photon yield. The results of this analysis are presented in
Figs. 3-5. The calculations were organized as follows.

As a ﬁrst step, let us consider the undulators with diﬀerent number of periods, N = 1, 2, 3 . . . . The value of
N deﬁnes the period length: λN = L/N . For ﬁxed ε, L and N the ﬁrst relation from (1) uniquely deﬁnes the
dependence of a on C, and, as direct consequence, the dependence of p = 2πγa/λ on C:

a(C) =

p(C) =

(9)

maxL2/4π2ε and pmax = U ′

where amax = U ′
maxL/2πmc2 are the absolute maximum values of the amplitude
and undulator parameter achieved at C = 1 and N = 1. The dependences a(C)/d and p(C) are presented in
Figs. 3(a)-(b). Fig. 3(c) presents the dependence of the parameter η on C which, as it follows from (5), has the
form η(C)

2 + p2(C) and for each N reaches its maximum value at C = 1, ηmax = η(1).

Eq. (9) and ﬁgs. 3(a)-(c) show that generic type of each of the functions, - a(C), p(C) or η(C), is independent
on N , so that in each graphs the curves for diﬀerent N diﬀer only quantitatively (for ﬁxed C the larger values
of a, p and η correspond to the smaller N ’s).

≡

These quantities, being used in (4), allow one to analyze the dependence of the energy emitted at given
d3E/~ dω dΩ
frequency in the forward direction d3EN (C)
on N and C, see Fig. 3(d). Let us mention
several features of the functions d3EN (C) and relate them to other graphs presented in Fig. 3. Firstly, comparing
the graphs (d) and (c) one notices that for each N the (most pronounced) maxima are located at those C-values
which correspond to η(C) = 1, 3, 5 . . . , whereas for even η the spectrum d3EN (C) = 0 in accordance with
general theory of the planar undulator radiation. The maximum value of η is much larger than one for N = 1
1.5 in the case N = 6. As a result, the number of the maxima of d3EN (C) decreases with N . The
but ηmax ≈
open circles in Fig. 3(d) mark the highest (for a given N ) peak. It is seen that the position C0 of the highest
peak gradually shifts towards larger values as N increases. This feature reﬂects the fact that for each N the
highest peak corresponds to η = 1, which is achieved at larger C’s as N grows, - Fig. 3(c). The height of the peak

ﬁrst of these it follows that d3EN (C0)

N 2 on the r.h.s. of (6)). However, as C0 becomes larger the dechanneling lengths Ld(C0), eq. (7), decreases, so
L/Ld(C0)) reduce d3EN (C0). Therefore, there exists a particular

The data presented in Figs. 3 and 4 illustrate the procedure, following which one deﬁne the optimal parameters
of the crystalline undulator (with pre-set values of ε, L and ~ω) in order to achieve the highest yield of the emission
of the energy 20 keV. However, the values of the undulator parameter p in all four cases described in the caption
to Fig. 4 indicate that for ~ω > 20 keV one can expect higher values of the spectral intensities d3E/~dωdΩ.
Indeed, as it follows from general theory of undulator radiation (see, e.g.,10), in the case p > 1 the number of
p3 and the intensity of emission into the fundamental harmonic is not the highest one.
emitted harmonics is
To illustrate this statement in Fig. 5 we present the results of calculation of d3E/~dωdΩ (eq. (4)) over the wide
range of photon energies. In each graph from this ﬁgure the characteristics of the undulator (C, p, a/d and λ) are
as in the graph with the same N from Fig. 5. The harmonic-like character of the spectral distribution manifests
itself in each graph, although it becomes more pronounced with the increase of N : the number of the emitted
harmonics (peaks) in Fig. 5(d) exceeds that seen in graph 5(a) by a factor approximately equal to the cubed
ratio of the corresponding undulator parameters (p = 3.8 and p = 1.8, see Fig. 4). The ﬁgure demonstrates also
that the undulators, initially ’tuned’ to the emission of ~ω = 20 keV, can be used to generate more energetic

emission. Each graph corresponds to the parameters which are indicated in the the caption to Fig. 3.

The energy ~ωn = n~ω1 of the harmonic of a suﬃciently large order n might become comparable with the
characteristic energy of the channeling radiation.8 Therefore, it is meaningful to compare the spectra of the
undulator and the channeling radiation. In Fig. 5 powerful and wide peaks in the region ~ω

3.3. Numerical results for ’Undulator 2’.

The results of numerical analysis of the second undulator, - eq. (3), are presented in Figs. 6-8 The calculations
were performed following, basically, the scheme outlined in Sec. 3.2, though there were several speciﬁc features.

Firstly, the energy of radiation was not limited by experimental conditions. Therefore, it was meaningful to
analyze the radiation within the range ~ω = 102 . . . 103 keV where the photon attenuation becomes much less
pronounced, see Fig. 2. The data presented below refer to the undulator tuned to the ﬁrst harmonic energy
~ω1 = 5 MeV. The corresponding attenuation length is nearly three orders of magnitude larger than the crystal
length L = 150 µm. Therefore, the photon attenuation can be completely disregarded. (In formal terms this
means that one can put κa = L/La(ω) = 0 on the right-hand side of (6).)

≫

C)2Ld(0)

Secondly, the length of Undulator 2 only slightly exceeds that of Undulator 1, whereas the beam energy,
ε = 10 GeV, is nearly 20 times higher. As a result, the dechanneling length Ld(0) becomes more that an order
of magnitude larger than the crystal length (see Table 1). Therefore, one may expect that a strong inequality
Ld(C) = (1
L will be valid over a wide range of the bending parameter C leading to a decrease of
the inﬂuence of the dechanneling eﬀect on the photon yield. Figs. 6(a)-(d) present the dependences a(C)/d, p(C),
η(C) (see (9)) and d3EN (C) - the energy emitted in the forward direction, calculated for several values of the
number N of undulator periods. General features of all dependences are similar to those presented in Figs. 3. The
qualitative diﬀerences are mostly pronounced for the a(C) dependences: it is seen that the a/d values in Fig. 6(a)
are by more than an order of magnitude smaller than those in Fig. 3(a). This is solely due to the diﬀerences
maxL2/4π2ε (see(9)) for Undulator
in the crystal length and the beam energy.
2 is approximately 15 times less than for Undulator 1. On the contrary, the factor pmax = U ′
maxL/2πmc2 is
independent on ε, and this results in close values of p(C) for both undulators. The peak intensities of d3EN (C)
in Fig. 6(d) are three orders of magnitude higher than those in Fig. 3(d). This increase is due to the following
two reasons. Firstly, the factor γ2 on the r.h.s. of (4) ensures the increase by more than 2 orders of magnitude.
The rest is donated by the enhancement of the factor
DN (η) due to the decrease of the ratios κd = L/Ld(C)
and κa = L/La(ω).

Indeed, the factor amax = U ′

Six graphs in Fig. 7 present spectral distribution of the radiation in the forward direction as a function of
photon energy within the interval including ~ω = 5 MeV and calculated for diﬀerent N values. For each N
the calculations were performed for the parameters C, a, η and p marked in Fig. 6 by the circles. The solid
and dashed curves were obtained with and without account for the positron dechanneling (the attenuation is
negligibly small for a 5 MeV photon). As mentioned above, the inﬂuence of this eﬀect in the case of Undulator
2 is much less pronounced that for Undulator 1 (see Fig. 4). Only in the two last graphs for N = 6 and N = 7
the account for the dechanneling results in a noticeable decrease of the photon yield. These cases correspond
(see the caption) to large values of the parameter C which, in turn, greatly reduces the dechanneling length (see
eq. (7)) making it comparable or even less than the length of the crystal.

Finally, let us shortly comment on the graphs from Fig. 7 which present the spectra d3E/~dωdΩ over the
wide range of photon energies calculated for the undulators with the parameters enlisted in the caption to Fig. 7.
Note the double log scaled used in this ﬁgure in contrast to its analogue for Undulator 1, - Fig. 7. Similar to the
latter case the undulator radiation contains several peaks corresponding to diﬀerent harmonics. The energies
~ωn of the harmonics with low order n are well-below the regions where the channeling radiation (the dashed
curves) dominates.

4. CONCLUSION

Theoretical investigations of the last decade2–4, 6 have proven that it is entirely realistic to use a positron-based
crystalline undulator for generating spontaneous radiation in a wide range of photon energies. The parameters of
such an undulator, being subject to the restrictions mentioned in Sect. 1, can be tuned by varying the parameters
of the bending, the positron energy and by choosing diﬀerent crystals and applying diﬀerent methods to create
periodically bent crystalline structures.

The eﬀorts of the last years have succeeded in constructing the consortium,1 consisting of leading European
groups, which will carry out further theoretical and experimental studies of this phenomenon. The latter,
provided being successful, will become a very important step toward actual construction of a new source of
electromagnetic radiation at very high energies.

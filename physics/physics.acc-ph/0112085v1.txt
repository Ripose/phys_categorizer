Abstract: A general procedure for construction of the formalism of quantum beam optics for any particle is reviewed.
The quantum formalism of spin- 1
2 particle beam optics is presented starting ab initio with the Dirac equation. As an
example of application the case of normal magnetic quadrupole lens is discussed. In the classical limit the quantum
formalism leads to the well-known Lie algebraic formalism of classical particle beam optics.

I. INTRODUCTION

Whenever the possibility of a quantum formalism of particle beam optics is mentioned the immediate response,
invariably, in the accelerator physics community is to ask what is the need to use quantum mechanics when classical
mechanics has been so successful in the design and operation of numerous accelerators? Of course, this is a natural
question and, though the system is quantum mechanical at the fundamental level, in most situations classical mechanics
is quite adequate [1] since the de Broglie wavelength of the (high energy) beam particle is very small compared to the
typical apertures of the cavities in accelerators as has been pointed out clearly by Chen. [2] But, the recent attention to
the sensitivity of tracking of particle trajectories to quantum granularities in the stochastic regions of phase space [3]
and the limits placed by quantum mechanics on the achievable beam spot sizes in accelerators [4] clearly indicates the
need for a formalism of quantum beam optics relevant to such issues. [5] Besides this, with ever increasing demand
for higher energies and luminosity and lower emittance beams, and the need for polarized beams, the interest in the
studies on the various quantum aspects of beam physics is growing. [6] So, it is time that a quantum formalism of
particle beam dynamics is developed in which all aspects (optical, spin, radiation, . . ., etc.) are considered in a uniﬁed
framework.

The grand success of the classical theories accounts for the very few quantum approaches to the charged-particle

beam optics in the past. Notable among these are:

•

1930 Glaser: Quantum theory of image formation in electron microscopy - Semiclassical theory based on the
nonrelativistic Schr¨odinger equation. [7]

equation. [8] 1995: Quantum theory of aberrations to all orders using the Klein-Gordon theory and the Dirac
Theory. [9] 1996: Spin dynamics of the Dirac particle beam. [10]

The formalism of quantum theory of charged-particle beam optics developed by Jagannathan et al., based on the
Klein-Gordan and Dirac equations, provides a recipe to work out the quantum maps for any particle optical system
up to any desired order. [8]− [11]. The classical limit (de Broglie wavelength
0) of this quantum formalism
reproduces the well-known Lie algebraic approach of Dragt et al. [12] for handling the classical beam optics. Spin
evolution, independent of orbital motion, can also be treated classically using the Lie algebraic approach. [13] This
brief note is to present the essential features of the quantum formalism of spin- 1
2 particle beam optics based on the
Dirac equation.

II. THE GENERAL FORMALISM OF QUANTUM BEAM OPTICS

In many accelerator optical elements the electromagnetic ﬁelds are static or can be reasonably assumed to be static.
In such devices one can further ignore the times of ﬂights which may be negligible, or of no direct relevance, as the
emphasis is more on the proﬁles of the trajectories. The idea is to analyze the evolution of the beam parameters of the
various individual charged-particle beam optical elements (quadrupoles, bending magnets,
) along the optic axis of
the system. Let us consider a charged-particle at the point (r
is the transverse coordinate and s refers
to the coordinate along the optic axis. After passing through the system this particle arrives at the point (r
, sout).
Note that (r
, s) constitute a curvilinear coordinate system, adapted to the geometry of the system. Given the initial
quantities at an sin, the problem is to determine the ﬁnal quantities at an sout, and to design an optical device in
such a way that the relations between the initial and ﬁnal quantities have the desired properties. Since we want to
know the evolution of the beam parameters along the optic axis of the system the starting equation of the quantum
formalism should be desirably of the form

linear in ∂/∂s, irrespective of the basic time-dependent equation (Schr¨odinger, Klein-Gordon, Dirac,
) governing
the system. So the step - I of building the quantum formalism is to cast the basic equation of quantum mechanics,
relevant for the system under study, in the form (1). Once this is done the step - II would be to obtain the relationship
for the quantities at any point s to the quantities at the point sin. This in the language of the quantum formalism
at the transverse plane at s to the observable
would require to obtain the relationship for an observable

Equation (1) is the basic equation of the quantum formalism of charged-particle beam optics and we call it as the
beam optical equation, ˆ

as the beam optical Hamiltonian and ψ as the beam optical wavefunction.

To summarize, we have a two-step algorithm to build a quantum formalism of charged-particle beam optics. On
may question the applicability of the two-step algorithm: Does it always work? From experience we know that it
works for the Schr¨odinger, Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations. The above description gives an oversimpliﬁed picture
of the formalism than, it actually is. There are several crucial points to be noted to understand the success of the
two-step algorithm. The ﬁrst step in the algorithm to obtain the beam optical equation is much more than a mere
mathematical transformation which eliminates ‘t’ in preference to a variable ‘s’ along the optic axis. There has to
be a clever set of transformations ensuring that the resultant s-dependent equation has a very close physical and
mathematical analogy with the original t-dependent equation of the standard quantum mechanics. Without this
guiding requirement it would not be possible to execute the second step of the algorithm which ensures that we can
use all the rich machinery of the quantum mechanics to compute the transfer maps characterizing the optical system.
This summarizes the recipe of obtaining the quantum prescriptions for the optical transfer maps. Rest is mostly a
computational aﬀair which is inbuilt in the powerful algebraic machinery of the algorithm. As in any computation,
there are some reasonable assumptions and some possible approximations coming from physical considerations. It
is important to note that in the case of the Schr¨odinger, Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations the beam optical forms
obtained are exact. Approximations necessarily enter only in the step - II of the algorithm, i.e., while integrating the
beam optical equation and computing the transfer maps for the quantum averages of the beam observables. As in
the classical theory, the approximations arise due to the fact that only the ﬁrst few terms are retained in the inﬁnite
series expansion of the beam optical Hamiltonian. The beam optical Hamiltonian is obtained as a power series in
ˆπ
where p0 is the design (or average) momentum of the beam particles moving predominantly along the optic
|
axis of the system and ˆπ
is the small transverse kinetic momentum. The leading order contribution gives rise to the
paraxial or the ideal behavior and higher order contributions give rise to the nonlinear or aberrating behavior. Both
the paraxial and the aberrating behaviors deviate from their classical nature by quantum contributions which are in
powers of the de Broglie wavelength of the beam particle (λ0 = 2π¯h/p0). The classical formalism is obtained from
the quantum formalism by taking the limit λ0 −→

III. FORMALISM OF THE DIRAC PARTICLE BEAM OPTICS

Now we shall see how the above algorithm works for the Dirac particle. Let us consider a monoenergetic beam of
Dirac particles particles of mass m, charge q and anomalous magnetic moment µa, transported through a magnetic
optical element with a straight optic axis characterized by the static potentials (φ(r), A(r)). The beam propagation
is governed by the stationary Dirac equation

The eﬀect of the transformation (7) is to make the lower components of a Dirac spinor corresponding to a quasi-
paraxial beam moving in the positive z-direction negligible compared to the upper components and thus eﬀectively
making the 4-component spinor as a 2-component spinor. Now one may observe the close analogy:

This completes the step - I of the algorithm. To execute the step - II we proceed as follows.

The above analogy suggests that, as the most systematic way to understand the Dirac Hamiltonian as a nonrel-
ativistic part plus relativistic correction terms is to use the Foldy-Wouthuysen (FW) transformation technique, [14]
we should adopt a similar FW-like approach in the beam optical case to understand the beam optical Hamiltonian
as a paraxial part plus nonparaxial correction terms. This leads to a procedure to obtain the paraxial behavior

It is to be noted that the transformation (10) keeps the upper components of the beam optical wavefunction large
compared to its lower components. One can proceed with further FW-like transformations and stop at any desired
stage. Let us denote the 2-component spinor comprising the upper components of the ﬁnal 4-component spinor
obtained in the above process as

Up to now, all the observables, the ﬁeld components, time etc., have been deﬁned in the laboratory frame. The
covariant description of the spin of the Dirac particle has the simplest operator representation in the rest frame of
the particle. Thus, in accelerator physics the spin is deﬁned in the rest frame of the particle. So we make a further
transformation which takes us from the beam optical form to the accelerator optical form

Thus we have got a fully quantum mechanical derivation of the combined eﬀect of the focusing action of the quadrupole
lens (note the traditional transfer matrices) and the Stern-Gerlach force. It may be noted that the quantum formalism
of spinor beam optics supports, in principle, the idea of a Stern-Gerlach spin-splitter device to produce polarized
beams. [15] The transfer map across the quadrupole lens for the spin components computed using the above accelerator
optical Hamiltonian describes the well known Thomas-Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi spin evolution. [10]

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In ﬁne, we have seen how one can obtain the formalism of quantum beam optics for any particle, starting ab initio
from the relevant basic quantum equation, at the single-particle level. A two-step algorithm for this purpose has been
suggested. Using the general principle, the construction of a spinor theory of accelerator optics, starting from the
Dirac equation and taking into account the anomalous magnetic moment, has been demonstrated. As an example of
application of the resulting formalism the normal magnetic quadrupole lens has been discussed. In the classical limit
the quantum formalism leads to the Lie algebraic formalism of charged-particle beam optics.

To get a formalism taking into account the multiparticle eﬀects, particularly for the intense beams, it should be
worthwhile to be guided by the quantum-like approaches to the particle beam transport: Thermal Wave Model [16]
and Stochastic Collective Dynamical Model [17]. Recently the quantum-like approach has been applied to construct a
Diﬀraction Model for the beam halo. [18] This model provides numerical estimates for the beam losses. In this context,
another useful approach could be to use the Wigner phase-space distribution functions. Heinemann and Barber [19]
have initiated the derivation of such a formalism for the Dirac particle beam physics starting from the original work
of Derbenev and Kondratenko [20] who used the FW technique to get their Hamiltonian for radiation calculations.

The present study is conﬁned to systems with straight optic axis. An extension to the curved optic axis systems
should be done. This would involve the subtlities of quantization in curvilinear coordinates. Then there are the well
known questions related to the position operator in the relativistic quantum theory. Also, there are doubts about the
exact form of the Stern-Gerlach force for a relativistic particle. [21] To address such questions from the point of view
of experiments using particle beams the right platform would be the formalism of quantum beam optics.

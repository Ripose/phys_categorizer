Abstract

An interpretation of the formation of halo in accelerators based on quantum-
like theory by a diﬀraction model is given in terms of the transversal beam
motion. Physical implications of the longitudinal dynamics are also examined.

Keywords: Beam Physics, Quantum-like, Halo, Beam Losses, Protons, Ions.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recently the description of the dynamical evolution of high density beams by using the
collective models, has become more and more popular. A way of developing this point of
view is the quantum-like approach [1] where one considers a time-dependent Schr¨odinger
equation, in both the usual linear and the less usual nonlinear form, as a ﬂuid equation
for the whole beam. In this case the squared modulus of the wave function (named beam
wave function) gives the distribution function of the particles in space at a certain time [2].
The Schr¨odinger equation may be taken in one or more spatial dimensions according to the
particular physical problem; furthermore the motion of the particles in the conﬁguration
space can be considered as a Madelung ﬂuid if one chooses the equation in its linear version.
Although the validity of the model relies only on experiments and on the new predictions
which must be veriﬁed experimentally, we like to invoke here a theoretical argument that
could justify the Schr¨odinger quantum-like approach. Let us think of particles in motion
within a bunch in such a way that the single particle moves under an average force ﬁeld

1

due to the presence of all others and collides with the neighbouring ones in a complicated
manner. It is obviously impossible to follow and describe all the forces deterministically. One
then faces a situation where the classical motion determined by the force-ﬁeld is perturbed
continuously by a random term, and one ﬁnds immediately a connection with a stochastic
process. If one assumes that the process is Markovian and Brownian, one easily arrives at
a modiﬁcation of the equations of motion in such a manner that would be synthesized by
a linear Schr¨odinger equation depending on a physical parameter that has the dimension of
action [3,4]. Wave quantum mechanics follows if this parameter coincides with the Planck’s
constant ¯h, whereas the quantum-like theory of beams is obtained if one chooses it as the
normalized emittance ǫ [1]. In both cases, the evolution of the system is expressed in terms
of a continuous ﬁeld ψ which deﬁnes the so-called Madelung ﬂuid. We may notice that the
normalized emittance ǫ with the dimension of an action is the natural choice in the quantum-
like theory, that ﬁnds the analogue in the Planck’s constant ¯h because it reproduces the
corresponding area in the phase-space of the particle.

We here point out that, after linearizing the Schr¨odinger-like equation, for beams in
an accelerator, one can use the whole apparatus of quantum mechanics, keeping in mind
a new interpretation of the basic parameters (for instance the Planck’s constant ¯h −→ ǫ
where ǫ is the normalized beam emittance).
In particular one introduces the propagator
K (xf , tf |xi, ti) of the Feynman theory for both longitudinal and transversal motion. A
procedure of this sort seems eﬀective for a global description of several phenomena such as
intrabeam scattering, space-charge, particle focusing, that cannot be treated easily in detail
by “classical mechanics”. One consequence of this procedure is to obtain information on
the creation of the Halo around the main beam line by the losses of particles due to the
transversal collective motion.

Let us indeed consider the Schr¨odinger like equation for the beam wave function

in the linearized case U (x, t) does not depend on the density |ψ|2. ǫ here is the normalized
transversal beam emittance deﬁned as follows:

˜ǫ being the emittance usually considered, (we may also introduce the analogue of the de
Broglie wavelength as λ = ǫ/p). Let us now focus our attention on the one dimensional
transversal motion along the x-axis of the beam particles belonging to a single bunch and
assume a Gaussian transversal proﬁle for particles injected into a circular machine. We want
to try a description of interactions that cannot be treated in detail, as a diﬀraction through
a slit that becomes a phenomenological boundary in each segment of the particle trajectory.
This condition should be applied to both beam wave function and beam propagator K. The
result is a multiple integral that determines the actual propagator between the initial and
ﬁnal states in terms of the space-time intervals due to the intermediate segments.

where τ = nτ ′ is the total time spent by the beam in the accelerator (total time of revolutions
in circular machines), T is the time necessary to insert the bunch (practically the time
between two successive bunches) and (−b, +b) the space interval deﬁning the boundary
mentioned above. Obviously b and T are phenomenological parameters which vary from a
machine to another and must also have a strict correction with the geometry of the vacuum
tube where the particles circulate.

1. We substitute the correct K with the free particle K0 assuming that in the τ ′ interval

V. LONGITUDINAL MOTION

As far as the longitudinal motion is concerned the quantum-like approach appears to
be quite appropriate to obtain information on the modiﬁed length (and consequently the
stability) of the bunches both in the linear and circular accelerators.. To be more speciﬁc it
describes a large number of important nonlinear phenomena that are present in RF particle
accelerators (with residual addition of longitudinal coupling impedance) as well as in cold
plasmas [8].

We introduce the Gaussian parameter b, as we did with the Gaussian slit e−

in the
transversal motion and look for a phenomenological solution of the equation for the beam
wave function ψ

where ω is the synchrotron frequency, Λ represents the coupling with non-linear terms and
x is the longitudinal particle displacement with respect to the synchrotronous one.

The Feynman propagator is given by Eq. (11) and the initial wave function can be again
assumed as a Gaussian wave packet. The main diﬀerence with the transversal case stays in
the numerical values of the parameters that exhibit a diﬀerent physical situation and require
a diﬀerent physical interpretation.

VII. COMMENTS AND CONCLUSIONS

Transversal Motion: This use of a quantum-like approach appears a simple powerful tool
for the analysis of the evolution of a beam in linear and circular accelerators and storage
rings.

Indeed the introduction of a very limited number of phenomenological parameters (in
our simpliﬁed model the only parameter b) in the beam quantum-like equations and the use
of the Schr¨odinger-type solutions allow us to calculate how the bunches evolve and modify
owing to the forces (linear and non-linear) acting on the particles.

As far as the betatronic oscillations are concerned the mechanism of the diﬀraction
through a slit appears a very adequate phenomenological approach. Indeed we can interpret
the probability (local and total) for a particle leaving its position as the mechanism of
creating a halo around the main ﬂux.

The values of τ , ω are strictly connected with the characteristic parameters of the designs

of the accelerators (in our example LHC and HIDIF)

The phenomenological parameter b represents several fundamental processes that are
present in the beam bunches (and play a determinant role in the creation of the halo) such
as intrabeam scattering, beamstrahlung, space-charge and imperfections in the magnets of
the lattice that could cause non-linear perturbative eﬀects.

We like to recall here the analogy with the diﬀraction through a slit in optics where it
represents a much more complicated physical phenomenon based on the scattering of light
against atomic electrons.

τ is the total time spent in the accelerator by a single bunch, T may coincide with
the average time interval between two successive injections and ω is the betatronic average
frequency given by 2πQfr, fr being the revolution frequency.

The fact that a small number of parameters can take into account many physical processes
is a very nice feature of the quantum-like diﬀraction approach. However the deep connection
between this method and the actual physical process as well as the nonlinear dynamical
classical theory is necessary to be understood.

We remark now the following points

1. The total probability (per particle) calculated from the free particle propagator (P )
and from the harmonic oscillator one (Pω) appear very near for the two diﬀerent
circular systems, LHC and HIDIF.

2. The local distribution between the two however looks quite diﬀerent for the free and
harmonic oscillator case, thus giving us a proﬁle of the halo which appears particularly
interesting in the HIDIF case (ﬁnal Gaussian width ∼ 1
√ ˜α

∼ 2.07 × 10−

1 m)

7

3. The HIDIF scenario, as we expect because of the higher intensity, exhibits a total
loss of particles (and beam power) which is at least 103 times higher than LHC. The
picture we have obtained for the transversal motion in the two analyzed examples (on
the basis of the parameters provided by the latest designs) is encouraging because the
halo losses are under control. In both cases the estimated losses of the beam power
appear much smaller than the permissible 1 Watt/m.

Longitudinal motion The formulae (7) and (13) can be used for calculating the motion
of the length of the bunch related to the synchrotron oscillations in both linear and circular
machines.
In this case we must consider only the propagator of the harmonic oscillator
which is the simplest linear version of the classical dynamical motion for the two canonical
conjugate variables that express the deviations of an arbitrary particle from the synchronous
one namely the RF phase diﬀerence ∆φ = φ − φs and the energy diﬀerence ∆E = E − Es.
Our examples are again the LHC synchrotron oscillations and the ones of the main LINAC
in the HIDIF project. The phenomenological Gaussian function e−
acquires a diﬀerent
meaning from the one it had in the transversal motion. Our analysis deals with a Gaussian
longitudinal proﬁle and predicts a coasting beam in LHC and a quite stable bunch in the
main LINAC of HIDIF.

x2/2b2

We may therefore conclude that our approach although preliminary is interesting and
particular attention is required in treating the longitudinal motion where the nonlinear
space-charge forces are very important. So the quantum-like method appears promising for
the future simulations in beam physics.

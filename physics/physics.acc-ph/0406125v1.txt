Abstrat

A three-dimensional, spae-frequeny model for the exitation of eletromagneti

radiation in a free-eletron laser is presented. The approah is applied in a numerial

partile ode WB3D, simulating the interation of a free-eletron laser operating in

the linear and non-linear regimes. Solution of the eletromagneti exitation equa-

tions in the frequeny domain inherently takes into aount dispersive e(cid:27)ets arising

from the avity and the gain medium. Moreover, it failitates the onsideration of

statistial features of the eletron beam and the exited radiation, neessary for the

study of spontaneous emission, synhrotron ampli(cid:28)ed spontaneous emission (SASE),

super-radiane and noise.

We employ the ode to study the statistial and spetral harateristis of the

radiation generated in a pulsed beam free-eletron laser operating in the millimeter

wavelengths. The evolution of radiation spetrum, exited when a Gaussian shaped

bunh with a random distribution of eletrons is passing through the wiggler, was

investigated. Numerial results of spontaneous emission power along the wiggler are

ompared to analytial preditions in the linear regime. In the (cid:28)rst few periods,

the power is exited from shot-noise in the low-gain regime. An exponential growth

periods, until saturation ours when arriving to the non-linear regime of the FEL

operation.

Introdution

Eletron devies suh as mirowave tubes and free-eletron lasers (FELs) uti-

lize distributed interation between an eletron beam and eletromagneti ra-

diation. Random eletron distribution in the e-beam auses (cid:29)utuations in ur-

rent density, identi(cid:28)ed as shot noise in the beam urrent [1℄-[4℄. Eletrons pass-

ing through a magneti undulator emit a partially oherent radiation whih is

alled undulator synhrotron radiation [5℄. The eletromagneti (cid:28)elds exited

by eah eletron add inoherently, resulting in spontaneous emission [6℄-[13℄.

When the eletron beam is modulated or pre-bunhed, the (cid:28)elds exited by

eletrons beome orrelated, and oherent summation of radiation (cid:28)elds from

individual partiles ours. If all eletrons radiate in phase with eah other,

the generated radiation beomes oherent (super-radiant emission).

In high-gain FELs, utilizing su(cid:30)iently long undulators, the spontaneous emis-

sion radiation exited in the (cid:28)rst part of the undulator is ampli(cid:28)ed along

the reminder of the interation region resulting in self-ampli(cid:28)ed spontaneous

emission (SASE) [14℄-[18℄. Super-radiant emission emerges if the eletrons are

injeted into the undulator in a single short bunh (shorter than the osilla-

tion period of the emitted radiation) [19℄-[25℄ or enter as a periodi train of

bunhes at the frequeny of the emitted radiation [26℄-[30℄.

Investigation of spontaneous and super-radiant emissions, as well as SASE,

all for analytial and numerial models, that an desribe non-stationary

stohasti proesses involved in the generation of inoherent or partially o-

herent radiation. In addition to the statistial features of the eletron beam

and radiation, the model should take into aount dispersive e(cid:27)ets evolving

in the medium, in whih the radiation is exited. The model presented in this

paper, utilizes an expansion of the total eletromagneti (cid:28)eld (radiation and

spae-harge waves) in terms of transverse eigenmodes of the medium, in whih

the (cid:28)eld is exited and propagates [31,32℄. The interation between the ele-

tron beam and the eletromagneti (cid:28)eld is desribed by a set of oupled-mode

exitation equations, that expresses the evolution of mode amplitudes in the

frequeny domain. The exitation equations are solved self-onsistently with

the equation of partiles motion, whih desribes the eletron beam dynamis.

main

The eletromagneti (cid:28)eld in the time domain is desribed by the spae-time

eletri E(r, t) and magneti H(r, t) signal vetors. r stands for the (x, y, z)

oordinates, where (x, y) are the transverse oordinates and z is the axis of

propagation. The Fourier transform of the eletri (cid:28)eld is de(cid:28)ned by:

E(r, f ) =

E(r, t) e+j2πf t df

(1)

+∞

Z−∞

where f denotes the frequeny. Similar expression is de(cid:28)ned for the Fourier
transform H(r, f ) of the magneti (cid:28)eld. Sine the eletromagneti signal is real
(i.e. E∗(r, t) = E(r, t)), its Fourier transform satis(cid:28)es E∗(r, f ) = E(r, −f ).

Analyti representation of the signal is given by the omplex expression:

The ross-orrelation funtion of the time dependent eletri E(r, t) and mag-
neti H(r, t) (cid:28)elds is given by:

Note that for (cid:28)nite energy signals, the total energy arried by the eletromag-

neti (cid:28)eld is given by W(z) = REH(z, 0)

Aording to the Wiener-Khinhine theorem, the spetral density funtion of

the eletromagneti signal energy SEH(z, f ) is related to the Fourier transform

of the ross-orrelation funtion REH(z, τ ) through the Fourier transformation:

The state of the partile i is desribed by a six-omponents vetor, whih
onsists of the partile's position oordinates ri = (xi, yi, zi) and veloity ve-
tor vi . The veloity of eah partile, in the presene of eletri E(r, t) and
magneti B(r, t) = µ0H(r, t) (cid:28)elds, is found from the Lorentz fore equation:

where e and m are the eletron harge and mass respetively. The (cid:28)elds repre-

sent the total (DC and AC) fores operating on the partile, and inlude also

7

the self-(cid:28)eld due to spae-harge. The Lorentz relativisti fator γi of eah

partile is found from the equation for kineti energy:

= −

e
mc2

1
vzi

vi · E(ri, t)

where c is the veloity of light.

The time it takes a partile to arrive at a position z , is a funtion of the

time t0i when the partile entered at z = 0, and its instantaneous longitudinal

veloity vzi(z) along the path of motion:

6 Numerial results

The WB3D ode was used to investigate the exitation of spontaneous emis-

sion in a millimeter wave free-eletron maser (FEM), with operational pa-

rameters given in Table 1. The orresponding dispersion urves of the FEM

8

are shown in Fig. 1. When the beam energy is set to 1.375 MeV, there are

two separated intersetion points between the beam and waveguide dispersion

urves, orresponding to the (cid:16)slow(cid:17) (vg1 < vz0 ) and (cid:16)fast(cid:17) (vg2 > vz0 ) synhro-

nism frequenies 29 GHz and 100 GHz, respetively. Lowering the beam en-

ergy to 1.066 MeV, results in a single intersetion at 44 GHz ("grazing limit"),

where the beam dispersion line is tangential to the waveguide dispersion urve

(vg = vz0 ).

The evolution of spontaneous emission power spetrum in the viinity of the

upper synhronism frequeny 100 GHz is drawn in Fig. 2.a. The power growth

along the wiggler as a funtion of the wiggling periods Nw is desribed in Fig.

2.b. In the (cid:28)rst few periods, the mutual interation between the eletromag-

neti radiation and the eletron beam is small and the power ampli(cid:28)ation

is low. Within this stage, the spontaneous radiation power inreases propor-

tional to N 2

w . An exponential growth of SASE is inspeted later after passing

a su(cid:30)ient number of periods, revealing that the interation enters to the high

gain regime, until saturation ours when arriving to the non-linear regime of

the FEL operation. Fig. 3 desribes the power evolution in the ase of grazing.

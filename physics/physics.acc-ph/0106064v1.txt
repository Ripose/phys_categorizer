Abstract

The SPEAR 3 upgrade lattice will provide much reduced beam emittance to increase the
brightness of synchrotron radiation beams from wigglers and undulators. Seven existing in-
sertion devices will be used in the lattice. In this paper we review the wiggler parameters,
outline the wiggler compensation scheme, and evaluate wiggler effect on the optics and dy-
namic aperture.

INTRODUCTION

insertion devices (ID). In this paper, we review the mag-
netic parameters for each of these ID’s, estimate linear and
higher order wiggler effects, evaluate radiation effects, and
discuss correction of wiggler focusing using quadrupole
trim windings. Tracking results show that dynamic aper-
ture reduction due to wiggler effects is modest. All optics
calculations were done with the MAD code [1], and the
tracking simulations with the LEGO code [2].

2 WIGGLER PARAMETERS, EFFECTS

AND MODELING

In SPEAR 3, the horizontally deﬂecting ID’s reside in dis-
persion free straights where the unperturbed β functions
are βx/βy =10.1/4.8 m. The magnetic ﬁeld parameters for
each ID are given in Table 1, where N is the number of
periods, λ the period length, Bo the peak ﬁeld.1 Future de-
vices are likely to be ∼10-period wigglers similar to Beam-
lines 9 and 11. These devices will replace the wigglers on
Beamlines 4 and 7 or illuminate new beam lines.

The main optical effects of the wigglers on the SPEAR
3 lattice are also summarized in Table 1. The parameter
deﬁnitions and relevant formulas are listed below:

where Qy=5.23 is the vertical betatron tune, ǫy the vertical
emittance, and E=3 GeV the beam energy.

For a ﬂat horizontal wiggler the ﬁeld components can be

expressed as [5]:

By = Bo cosh(ky) cos(kz),
Bz = −Bo sinh(ky) sin(kz),

(1)
(2)

where k = 2π/λ, y and z are the vertical and longitudi-
nal coordinates, and z=0 the center of a pole. The integral
of the By ﬁeld (Eqn. 1) with respect to the reference tra-
jectory vanishes over each wiggler period. This leads to
self compensation of the optics effects. For instance, the
horizontal orbit and dispersion generated by By are fully
localized within each period. The amplitude of the orbit
and dispersion is proportional to λ2Bo, and the increase in
beam path length is proportional to λ3B2
oN . Hence, the
largest orbit oscillations are produced in the wigglers with
the longest poles. The total increase of the path length for
all 7 wigglers is 191 µm.

Taking into account the horizontal orbit oscillations of
the beam, the Bz ﬁeld (Eqn. 2) can be decomposed into
longitudinal and horizontal components on the beam orbit.
Although the integral of the longitudinal component van-
ishes over each period, one can can ﬁnd a non-zero integral
of the ﬁeld horizontal to the beam trajectory [3]:

where label ˜x refers to the local horizontal axis with respect
to the oscillating beam orbit.

The ﬁrst term in Eqn. 3 (∝ y) is similar to the vertical
gradient in quadrupoles and thus results in vertical focus-
ing, namely the vertical tune shift ∆Qy and vertical beta-
tron beat ∆βy/βy. The total linear tune shift is ∆Qy=0.071
for all 7 wigglers. The pattern of the β-beat depends on
the distribution of wigglers in the ring. The ∼90o vertical
phase advance per cell helps to minimize beta perturbations

from a pair of wigglers if they are located on either side of
the same cell. All 7 wigglers generate about ±25% vertical
β-beat in the ring without correction.

The ﬁrst non-linear wiggler effect comes from the sec-
ond term in Eqn. 3 (∝ y3). This octupole-like ﬁeld gen-
erates quadratically increasing vertical tune shift with y-
amplitude. For devices of similar length (N λ) the ef-
fect is proportional to 1/λ2.
In Table 1, this tune shift
was evaluated for the maximum vertical emittance (ǫy=7.5
mm·mrad) deﬁned by the smallest vacuum chambers at
Beamlines 6 and 11 (y=6 mm, βy=4.8 m). The maximum
total tune shift for 7 wigglers is ∆Qoct
y =0.002. This value
is signiﬁcantly smaller than the amplitude dependent tune
shift caused by the sextupoles and was considered accept-
able. Tracking simulations with wiggler effects conﬁrm
that the vertical dynamic aperture stays well outside the
physical wiggler aperture.

For optics calculations, each wiggler pole was simu-
lated by a shorter pole with constant vertical ﬁeld and with
gaps between the poles [3]. In this model, the pole ﬁeld,
Bp = Boπ/4, and pole length, Lp = 4λ/π2, were set to
produce the same bending and focusing effect as the actual
wiggler ﬁeld. Therefore, the model yields the correct lin-
ear tune shift, β-beat, and the net orbit and dispersion. For
tracking studies, higher order multipole ﬁelds were added
to simulate the effects of non-linear wiggler ﬁelds on dy-
namic aperture.

3 RADIATION EFFECTS

Synchrotron radiation and quantum excitation in wigglers
increase the beam energy loss and change the equilibrium
emittance and the beam energy spread. For a single ID, the
relative increase in energy loss per turn is [6]:

where ρb=7.86 m is the bend radius in the main dipoles, and
Uo=913 keV/turn (without ID’s). The energy loss with all
7 wigglers at full ﬁeld increases by 23% to 1124 keV/turn.
The total radiated wiggler power is 225 kW from a 200 mA
beam.

ble 2. Emittance calculations show that 7 wigglers reduce
the horizontal emittance from 18.2 nm·rad to 15.3 nm·rad.

4 OPTICS COMPENSATION

The wiggler focusing from 7 wigglers at full ﬁeld gener-
ates ±25% vertical β-beat and a linear vertical tune shift
of 0.071. This distortion breaks the periodicity of the β-
functions and phase advance between sextupoles, which
could lead to stronger sextupole resonances and reduced
dynamic aperture.

Several options are possible to correct the wiggler fo-
cusing. The preferred scheme is to locally compensate the
distortion of β-functions and phase advance with four QF
and four QD independent quadrupole trims located to either
side of each ID. With this correction, the phase advance
stays identical in all cells, the global tune adjustment is
not necessary and the distortion of lattice functions at sex-
tupoles is minimal. The required independent quadrupole
trims are less than 10%. This correction scheme has been
designed into the SPEAR 3 lattice and was used in tracking
studies described in the following section. The SPEAR 3 β
functions after correction of 7 wigglers are shown in Fig. 1.

5 EFFECT ON DYNAMIC APERTURE

Effects of IDs on dynamic aperture arise from reduced
symmetry and lattice periodicity, distortion of β-functions
and betatron phase, non-linear wiggler ﬁelds, wiggler ﬁeld
errors and misalignment. In tracking simulations, we stud-
ied the following effects of wigglers on dynamic aperture:

- Linear wiggler focusing,
- Effect of systematic multipole ﬁeld errors in wigglers,
- Effect of intrinsic non-linear wiggler ﬁeld.

Without correction of the wiggler focusing, the vertical
dynamic aperture reduces by about 20% with all wigglers

active. With corrected wiggler focusing, linear wiggler ef-
fects alone do not reduce the aperture.

The study of wiggler multipole errors was based on mea-
sured systematic ﬁeld errors in the wiggler on Beamline 11.
A numerical multipole ﬁt to the measured data was per-
formed and the results for the integral of normal and skew
systematic multipole ﬁeld are shown in Table 3, where ‘n’
is the multipole order starting with dipole, L = N λ, and
an, bn are the skew and normal ﬁeld coefﬁcients deﬁned as

The effect of 7 wigglers on dynamic aperture is shown
in Fig. 2, with the aperture calculated at the ID locations
(βx/βy =10.1/4.8 m) for machine simulations with all er-
rors in the ring magnets. Without multipole errors in the
wigglers but with corrected wiggler focusing, the aperture
is not affected. With the systematic multipole errors in-
cluded in the 7 wigglers, the dynamic aperture reduction is
about 10% (2 mm).

The wiggler-intrinsic high order terms (Eqn. 3) were not
included in the previous simulation, but can further reduce
the dynamic aperture. This ﬁeld does not have the usual
form of (x-y) multipole expansion normally used in lattice
codes. To accurately study the effect of the octupole-like
and higher order terms in Eqn. 3, one needs a symplectic
model of this ﬁeld. We used an approximation to evaluate
the main effect of these terms. Since the non-linear B˜x
ﬁeld generates kicks only in y-plane, the effect on dynamic
aperture is expected to be mostly in the vertical plane, as it
was observed in simulations for other machines [6].

P

One can notice that the B˜x ﬁeld can be reproduced at
x=0 by the normal ﬁeld of Eqn. 6 (an=0). Using this ap-
proach, we used normal systematic multipoles in the form
bn(x + iy)n−1 to produce the non-linear
of By + iBx =
terms of the wiggler ﬁeld B˜x on the vertical axis (Eqn. 3),
and performed tracking to evaluate vertical aperture near
x=0. Simulation of the octupole-like and dodecapole-like
(∝ y5) ﬁelds with 7 wigglers showed only modest reduc-
tion of vertical dynamic aperture, from 11 mm to 8-9 mm.
This aperture still remains well outside the 6 mm wiggler
physical aperture.

Tracking simulations with 7 wigglers in SPEAR 3 predict
small impact on dynamic aperture when linear optics ef-

fects are locally compensated with individually controlled
quadrupole magnets. The 18 mm horizontal dynamic aper-
ture is sufﬁcient for 10 mm injection oscillations and long
Touschek lifetime, and the vertical aperture remains well
outside the 6 mm wiggler physical aperture. With all wig-
glers active, the increase in energy spread is negligible
(<2%), and the beam horizontal emittance decreases to
about 15.3 nm·rad at 3 GeV.

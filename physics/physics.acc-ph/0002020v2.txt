SIMULATION OF LASER-COMPTON COOLING
OF ELECTRON BEAMS∗

TOMOMI OHGAKI

Berkeley, California 94720, USA

We study a method of laser-Compton cooling of electron beams. Using a Monte Carlo
code, we evaluate the eﬀects of the laser-electron interaction for transverse cooling. The
optics with and without chromatic correction for the cooling are examined. The laser-
Compton cooling for JLC/NLC at E0 = 2 GeV is considered.

1. Introduction

A novel method of electron beam cooling for future linear colliders was proposed
by V.Telnov.1 During head-on collisions with laser photons, the transverse distri-
bution of electron beams remains almost unchanged and also the angular spread is
almost constant. Because the Compton scattered photons follow the initial electron
trajectory with a small additional spread due to much lower energy of photons (a
few eV) than the energy of electrons (several GeV). The emittance ǫi = σiσ′
i re-
mains almost unchanged (i = x, y). At the same time, the electron energy decreases
from E0 to Ef . Thus the normalized emittances have decreased as follows

ǫn = γǫ = ǫn0(Ef /E0) = ǫn0/C,

(1)

where ǫn0, ǫn are the initial and ﬁnal normalized emittances, the factor of the
emittance reduction C = E0/Ef . The method of electron beam cooling allows
further reduction of the transverse emittances after damping rings or guns by 1-3
orders of magnitude.1

In this paper, we have evaluated the eﬀects of the laser-Compton interaction for
transverse cooling using the Monte Carlo code CAIN.2 The simulation calculates
the eﬀects of the nonlinear Compton scattering between the laser photons and the
electrons during a multi-cooling stage. Next, we examine the optics for cooling
with and without chromatic correction. The laser-Compton cooling for JLC/NLC3
at E0 = 2 GeV is considered in section 4. A summary of conclusion is given in
section 5.

2. Laser-Electron Interaction

2.1. Laser-Electron Interaction

In this section, we describe the main parameters for laser-Compton cooling of
electron beams. A laser photon of energy ωL (wavelength λL) is backward-Compton
scattered by an electron beam of energy E0 in the interaction point (IP). The
kinematics of Compton scattering is characterized by the dimensionless parameter1

x0 ≡

E0[GeV]
λL[µm]

where me is electron mass. The parameters of the electron and laser beams for
laser-Compton cooling are listed in Tables 1 and 2. The parameters of the electron
beam with 2 GeV are given for JLC/NLC case in section 4. The parameters of that
with 5 GeV are used for simulation in the next subsection. The wavelength of laser
is assumed to be 0.5 µm. The parameters of x0 with the electron energies 2 GeV
and 5 GeV are 0.076 and 0.19, respectively.

where ZR, lγ(∼ 2σL,z), and le(∼ 2σz) are the Rayleigh length of laser, and the
bunch lengths of laser and electron beams. From this formula, the parameters of A
with the electron energies 2 GeV and 5 GeV are 56 J and 4 J, respectively.

In this study, for the electron energies 2 GeV and 5 GeV, the parameters of ξ are
2.2 and 1.5, respectively.

(5)

where the rms energy of the initial beam is σe0 and the ratio of energy spread is
deﬁned as δ = σe/Ef . If the parameter ξ or x0 is larger, the energy spread after
Compton scattering is increasing and it is the origin of the emittance growth in the
defocusing optics, reacceleration linac, and focusing optics. The energy spreads δ
for the electron energies 2 GeV and 5 GeV are 9.8% and 19%, respectively.

The equilibrium emittances due to Compton scattering are1

ǫni,min =

7.2 × 10−10βi[mm]
λL[µm]

(i = x , y) [m · rad],

(6)

where βi are the beta functions at IP. From this formula we can see that small beta
gives small emittance. However the large change of the beta functions between the
magnet and the IP causes the emittance growth. Taking no account of the emittance
growth, for the electron energies 2 GeV and 5 GeV, the equilibrium emittances are
5.8 × 10−9 m·rad and 1.4 × 10−10 m·rad, respectively. The equilibrium emittances
depended on ξ in the case ξ2 ≫ 1 were calculated in Ref. 1.

2.2. Simulation of Laser-Electron Interaction

For the simulation of laser-electron interaction, the electron beam is simply
assumed to be a round beam in the case of E0 = 5 GeV and C = 5. Taking no
account of the emittance growth of optics, the one stage for cooling consists two
parts as follows:

1. The laser-Compton interaction between the electron and laser beams.

2. The reacceleration of electrons in linac.

In the ﬁrst part, we simulated the interactions by the CAIN code.2 This simulation
calculates the eﬀects of the nonlinear Compton scattering between the laser photons
and the electrons. We assume that the laser pulse interacts with the electron bunch
in head-on collisions. The βx and βy at the IP are ﬁxed to be 0.1 mm. The initial
energy spread of the electron beams is 1%. The energy of laser pulse is 20 J. The
diﬀerence of the pulse energy between the simulation and the formula depends on
the transverse sizes of the electron beams at IP. The polarization of the electron
and laser beams are Pe=1.0 and PL=1.0 (circular polarization), respectively. When
the x0 and ξ parameters are small, the spectrum of the scattered photons does not
largely depend on the polarization combination. In order to accelerate the electron
beams to 5 GeV for recovery of energy in the second part, we simply added the
energy ∆E = 5 GeV − Eave for reacceleration, where Eave is the average energy of
the scattered electron beams after the laser-Compton interaction.

Here we deﬁne the transverse, longitudinal, and 6D emittances in the simulation.

The x, y-transverse emittance is

ǫn,i = qσ2

i σ2

i′ − (hi · i′i − hii hi′i)2 (i = x , y),

(7)

where the symbol h i means to take an average of all particles in a bunch.

The longitudinal emittance is

ǫn,l = qσ2

z σ2

pz − (hz · pzi − hzi hpzi)2/(mec).

The 6D emittance is deﬁned as

ǫ6N = ǫn,x · ǫn,y · ǫn,l.

Figure 1 shows the longitudinal distribution of the electrons after the ﬁrst laser-
Compton scattering. The average energy of the electron beams is 1.0 GeV and the
energy spread δ is 0.19. The longitudinal distribution seems to be a boomerang. If
we assume a short Rayleigh length of laser pulse, the energy loss of head and tail
of beams is small. The number of the scattered photons per incoming particle and
the average of the photon energy at the ﬁrst stage are 40 and 96 MeV (rms energy
140 MeV), respectively.

The transverse sizes of the electron beams in the multi-stage cooling are shown
in Fig. 2. During collisions with the laser photons, the transverse distribution of
the electrons remains almost unchanged. But they decrease when we focus them
for the next laser-Compton interaction due to the lower normalized emittance and
βiǫn,i/γ). The angles of the electron beams in
the ﬁxed β-function at IP (σi =
the multi-stage cooling are shown in Fig. 3. As a result of reacceleration, the angles
of the electrons decrease. They increase when we focus them for the next laser-
Compton interaction. Finally the angles attain the average of Compton scattering
angle and the eﬀect of cooling saturates.

Figure 4 shows the transverse emittances of the electron beams in the multi-
stage cooling. From Eq.(6), ǫni,min = 1.4×10−10 m·rad, and the simulation presents
ǫni,min = 1.2×10−9 m·rad. Figure 5 shows the longitudinal emittance of the electron
beams in the multi-stage cooling. Due to the increase of the energy spread of the
electron beams from 1% to 19%, the longitudinal emittance rapidly increases at the
ﬁrst stage. After the ﬁrst stage, the normalized longitudinal emittance is stable.
The 6D emittance of the electron beams in the multi-stage cooling is shown in
Fig. 6. The second cooling stage has the largest reduction for cooling. The 8th
or 9th cooling stages have small reduction for cooling. The initial and ﬁnal 6D
emittances ǫ6N are 1.5 × 10−13 (m·rad)3 and 1.2 × 10−19 (m·rad)3, respectively.

Figure 7 shows the polarization of the electron beams in the multi-stage cooling.
The decrease of the polarization during the ﬁrst stage is about 0.06. The ﬁnal
polarization Pe after the multi-stage cooling is 0.54.

Figure 8 shows schematics of the laser-Compton cooling of electron beams. The
optics 1 is focusing the electron beams from a few meters of β-function to several
millimeters in order to eﬀectively interact them with the laser beams. The optics
2 is defocusing them from several millimeters to a few meters for reacceleration of
electron beams in linac. In a multi-stage cooling system, the optics 3 is needed for
cooling in the next stage. The problem for the focus and defocus optical devices is
the energy spread of electrons and the electron beams with a large energy spread
are necessary to minimize or correct the chromatic aberrations avoiding emittance
growth.

Fig. 8. Schematics of the laser-Compton cooling of electron beams.

In this subsection, we discuss the optics for laser-Compton cooling without chro-
matic corrections. For the focus and defocus of the beams, we use the ﬁnal doublet
system which is similar to that of the ﬁnal focus system of the future linear col-
liders.3 The pole-tip ﬁeld of the ﬁnal quadrupole BT is limited to 1.2 T and the
pole-tip radius a is greater than 3 mm. The strength of the ﬁnal quadrupole is

κ = BT /(aBρ) ≤ 120/E[GeV] [m

−2],

(10)

where B, ρ, and E are the magnetic ﬁeld, the radius of curvature and the energy of
the electron beams. In our case, the electron energies in the optics 1, 2, and 3 are
5.0, 1.0, and 5.0 GeV, respectively and the limit of the strength of the quadrupole

in laser cooling is much larger than that of the ﬁnal quadrupole of the future linear
colliders. Due to the low energy beams in laser cooling, the synchrotron radiation
from quadrupoles and bends is negligible.

The diﬀerence of three optical devices is the amount of the energy spread of the
beams. In the optics 1,2, and 3, the beams have one, several tens, and a few %
energy spread. In order to minimize the chromatic aberrations, we need to shorten
the length between the ﬁnal quadrupole and the IP. In this study, the length from
the face of the ﬁnal quadrupole to the IP, l is assumed to be 2 cm. Here we estimated
the emittance growth in the optics 2, because the chromatic eﬀect in the optics 2 is
the most serious. Figure 9 shows the defocus optics without chromaticity correction
for laser-Compton cooling by the MAD code.4 The input ﬁle is attached to Ref. 5.
The parameters of the electron beam for laser-Compton cooling at E0 = 5 GeV and
C = 5 are listed in Table 3. The initial βx and βy after laser-Compton interaction
are 20 mm and 4 mm, respectively. The ﬁnal βx and βy are assumed to be 2 m and
1 m, respectively. The initial and ﬁnal αx(y) with no energy spread δ = 0 are 0 in
this optics. The strength κ of the ﬁnal quadrupole for the beam energy of 1 GeV
from Eq. (10) is assumed to be 120 m−2.

approximation has been studied for the focusing system, and here the transverse
emittances are calculated by a particle-tracking simulation. The 10000 particles
are tracked for the transverse and longitudinal Gaussian distribution by the MAD
code. The relative energy spread δ is changed from 0 to 0.4. Due to the larger
chromaticity ξy, the emittance ǫy is rapidly increasing with the energy spread δ. If
we set a limit of 200% for ∆ǫi/ǫi (i = x, y), the permissible energy spread δx and
δy are 0.11 and 0.012 which mean the momentum band widths ±22% and ±2.4%,
respectively. The results are not suﬃcient for cooling at E0 = 5 GeV and C = 5,
because the beams through the defocusing optics have the energy spread of several
tens %. On the one hand, the optics can be useful as the optics 1 and 3 with the
energy spread of a few %.

3.2. Optics with chromaticity correction

The optics without chromaticity correction for the optics 2 does not work as
we saw in the previous subsection. In this subsection we apply the chromaticity
correction for the optics 2. The lattice for cooling is designed referring to the ﬁnal
focus system of the future linear colliders by K. Oide.7 The ﬁnal doublet system

is the same lattice as the optics before subsection. The method of chromaticity
correction uses one family of sextupole to correct for vertical chromaticity and
moreover we added two weak sextupoles in the lattice to correct for horizontal
chromaticity. Figure 11 shows the defocus optics with chromaticity correction for
the laser-Compton cooling. The input ﬁle is attached to Ref. 5. The total length of
the lattice is about 63 m.

The momentum dependence of the emittances in the defocus optics with chro-
maticity correction is shown in Fig. 12. The 10000 particles are tracked for the
transverse and longitudinal Gaussian distribution by the MAD code. The relative
energy spread δ is changed from 0 to 0.06 with the conservation κ2 θB, where κ2
and θB are the strength of the sextupole and the angle of the bending magnet. The
initial βx and βy after laser-Compton interaction are 20 mm and 4 mm, respectively.
The ﬁnal βx and βy are assumed to be 2 m and 1 m, respectively. The initial and
ﬁnal αx(y) with no energy spread δ = 0 are 0 in this optics. After the chromaticity
correction, the chromaticity functions ξx and ξy are 9.3 and 1.6, respectively. If
we set a limit of 200% for ∆ǫi/ǫi(i = x, y), the permissible energy spread δx and
δy are 0.040 and 0.023 which mean the momentum band widths ±8% and ±4.6%,
respectively. By the comparison with the results of the optics without chromaticity
correction at a limit of 200% for ∆ǫi/ǫi(i = x, y), the ǫy of the optics with chro-
maticity correction is about two times larger than that of the one before subsection,

but the ǫx of the optics with chromaticity correction is three times smaller than that

4. Laser-Compton Cooling for JLC/NLC at E0 = 2 GeV

4.1. Optics

For the future linear colliders, the method of laser-Compton cooling is eﬀective
to reduce the transverse emittances after damping rings. Where can it be placed?
There are two possibilities for JLC/NLC9 as follows:

1. After the ﬁrst bunch compressor (BC1) and before the pre-linac. E0 = 2 GeV

and σz = 0.5 mm.

GeV and σz = 0.1 mm.

2. After the second bunch compressor (BC2) and before the main linac. E0 = 10

Case 2 needs a large energy for recovery after Compton scattering and we consider
case 1 in this study. The parameters of the electron and laser beams for laser-
Compton cooling for JLC/NLC at E0 = 2 GeV and C = 10 are listed in Tables 1
and 2. The energy of laser pulse is 300 J. The simulation results of the laser-electron

interaction by the CAIN code are summarized as follows. The energy spread of the
electron beam is 11%. The decrease of the longitudinal polarization of the electron
beam is 0.038 (Pe = 1.0, PL = 1.0). The number of the scattered photons per
incoming particle and the average of the photon energy are 200 and 8.9 MeV (rms
energy 19 MeV), respectively.

The electron energy after Compton scattering in case 2 is 0.2 GeV and the
strength of the ﬁnal quadrupole from Eq. (10) is 600 m−2. Table 4 lists the param-
eters of the defocusing optics for laser-Compton cooling for JLC/NLC at E0 = 2
GeV and C = 10. The ﬁnal βx and βy are assumed to be 1 m and 0.25 m, respec-
tively. The chromaticity functions ξx and ξy are 18 and 23, respectively. Using the
MAD code, the emittance growth in the defocus optics are

The total reduction factor of the 4D transverse emittance of the laser-Compton
cooling for JLC/NLC at E0 = 2 GeV is about 18. The decrease of the polarization
of the electron beam is 0.038 due to the laser-Compton interaction.

5. Summary

We have studied the method of laser-Compton cooling of electron beams. The ef-
fects of the laser-Compton interaction for cooling have been evaluated by the Monte
Carlo simulation. From the simulation in the multi-stage cooling, we presented that
the low emittance beams with ǫ6N = 1.2 × 10−19(m·rad)3 can be achieved in our
beam parameters. We also examined the optics with and without chromatic correc-
tion for cooling, but the optics are not suﬃcient for cooling due to the large energy
spread of the electron beams.

The laser-Compton cooling for JLC/NLC at E0 = 2 GeV and C = 10 was
considered. The total reduction factor of the 4D transverse emittance of the laser-
Compton cooling is about 18. The decrease of the polarization of the electron beam
is 0.038 due to the laser-Compton interaction.

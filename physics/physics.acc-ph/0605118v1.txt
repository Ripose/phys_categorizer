Abstract. We propose an effective method for polarising antiprotons in a storage ring by means of a parallel moving
polarised electron beam. If their relative kinetic energy is adjusted to the order of 1 keV the probability for spin exchange
is as large as hσPzzi ≈ 270 barn. Using a 80% polarised electron beam with a peak current of 1.2 A and an average
of 32 mA a polarisation of the antiproton beam of 50% in 1.5 hours is achieved under realistic conditions in a 1.8 T m
storage ring. The basis of this proposal are new calculations of the spin transfer cross sections and a state of the art
source of polarised electrons. The examples of a specialised low energy polariser ring and the polarisation in a high
energy experimental storage ring show that the method is realisable with a polarised electron source based on todays
technology.

1 Introduction

The spin of elementary particles is essential for their symmetry
and in the dynamics of their interaction. After better and better
experimental methods for polarising a broad range of different
particles have been developed in the last decades, experiments
with spin variables represent one of the most signiﬁcant meth-
ods for investigations in subatomic physics.

However, the particularly signiﬁcant case, the antiproton,
is still not available for experimental investigations due to the
lack of sources for polarised antiprotons. Such a source would
allow for studies with iso-spin and spin symmetry in the inter-
action of nucleons at low, medium and high energies. In order
to substantiate this three ﬁelds are mentioned:

1. Spectroscopy of hadrons:

The annihilation of antiprotons on protons produces a mul-
titude of ﬁnal states with two or more mesons (for a sum-
mary see [1]). They carry the potential of containing new
states, so called exotics, like glue balls or hybrid states
composed of quarks and gluons. However, the analysis of
the ﬁnal states is hampered by the need to perform a partial
wave analysis which is frequently not unique. The exploita-
tion of the spin degree of freedom for both the projectile
antinucleon and the target nucleon would at least halven the
contributing amplitudes and increase the signiﬁcance of the
search for exotics considerably.
Furthermore, also the study of known states would be more
selective making an identiﬁcation clearer and offer an ad-
ditional parameter in the decay dynamics.
2. Antinucleon-nucleon scattering and reactions:

The same arguments hold for the antinucleon-nucleon elas-
tic scattering. These cross sections have been measured from

close to threshold up to many GeV. One particularly in-
triguing aspect is the spin and iso-spin dependence of the
antinucleon-nucleon interaction at low energies. As well
known the nucleon-nucleon and antinucleon-nucleon po-
tentials are connected in the still very successful meson
exchange description by the G-parity symmetry. However,
whereas it appears that the long range part of the potential is
in this way reasonably well described by the pion exchange
there is no sensitivity to the short range part attributed to the
vector meson exchange since the annihilation dominates for
radii shorter than about 0.8 fm (for summaries see [2,3]).
The different spin orientations in the entrance channel close
to threshold, where s- and p-wave scattering dominate, will
provide sensitivity to vector mesons, i.e. to the short range
of the real part of the antinucleon-nucleon interaction.
For the annihilation dynamics the question whether the quark
reorientation or the gluonic quark fusion-creation mecha-
nism (OZI rule violation ) prevails the spin degree of free-
dom would provide very signiﬁcant constraints.
3. Antinucleon-nucleon interactions at the parton level:

The generalised parton distributions received recently great
attention. It appears that the transversity distribution would
become accessible in reactions of polarised antiprotons and
protons (for a summary see e.g. [4]). Of course, the exper-
imental efforts for such a study would be great beyond the
realisation of a polarised antiproton source. Recently the
PAX collaboration has proposed just such an investigation
for the FAIR facility being prepared at GSI, however, with-
out showing how to polarise antiprotons effectively [5].
Though antiprotons are stable all proposals to polarise them
have been less than satisfactory so far. Of the many propos-
als [6] only two possibilities have been considered as possi-

bly feasible. In the ﬁrst, the Filtex collaboration has considered
the different attenuation of the spin components of an initially
unpolarised antiproton beam due to the difference of the sin-
glet and triplet scattering cross sections in the interaction with
a polarised hydrogen gas target. In a pilot experiment with
protons instead of antiprotons at the Test Storage Ring TSR
of the Max-Planck-Institute for Nuclear Physics at Heidelberg
in 1992 [7,8,9] this collaboration did indeed ﬁnd a small ef-
fect. The rate of polarisation was, however, only dPb/dt =
(0.0124 ± 0.0006)/h, even a factor of two smaller than ex-
pected, possibly due to the contribution of the polarised elec-
trons in the polarised hydrogen target [10]. Beside the slow po-
larisation build-up the scheme is questionable for antiprotons
since the total annihilation cross section is two times larger
than the elastic scattering and most likely little spin dependent
meaning that the beam will be faster annihilated than polarised.
Additionally, the Coulomb scattering in the hydrogen gas target
reduces the beam lifetime greatly.

The second possibility is the spin transfer in the scattering
of initially unpolarised nucleons/antinucleons from polarised
electrons of a gas target placed in the coasting beam of a stor-
age ring [11]. This idea has been taken up recently [12] and
used as the basis for the proposal of the PAX collaboration
[5]. However, the internal polarised hydrogen gas target will
Coulomb scatter the antiproton beam and makes the use of a
very large aperture storage ring mandatory. Therefore, it is not
easy to characterise the performance of this method with a few
numbers. Table 1 tries to transform the presentation of ref. [12]
into numbers which can be compared later to the method pro-
posed in this article.

reference the value ∆Q = 0.015 in the order of commonly ac-
cepted values for the operation of storage rings has been cho-
sen. We note for later that N ∆Q
max depends very sensitively on
βlab.

The optimisation of these numbers depends on the way the
polarised antiprotons would be used in a certain experiment.
We have chosen the situation of the antiproton polariser ring
and the high energy experimental storage ring HESR of the
FAIR project at GSI [12] in order to make a direct compari-
son possible. However, as we shall discuss in section 4.2, the
method proposed here can be adapted to many different situa-
tions in storage rings at low and high antiproton energies.

As a summary we note that a polariser has to be evaluated

by considering
- the polarisation time,
- the degree of polarisation after this time,
- the number of antiprotons available after this time, and
- the phase space of the polarised antiprotons.

The evident remedy for avoiding the problems of the in-
ternal polarised target as Coulomb scattering and the large and
expensive accelerator acceptance would be the interaction of a
pure electron beam or target with a pure antiproton target or
beam, respectively. This idea, considered since the early phase
of the Low Energy Antiproton Ring LEAR at CERN, was,
however, never thoroughly pursued since reliable calculations
of the cross sections for the spin transfer adapted to the situ-
ation in a storage ring were missing. Unfortunately, the more
recent calculations of C.J. Horowitz and H.O. Meyer [11] are
not sufﬁciently realistic at low energies. As will be shown by
the new calculations in section 2 their approximations for the
Coulomb corrections are too pessimistic. Further, they use a
moving reference system depending on the scattering angle in-
stead of the laboratory frame of the ring. Recently A.I. Milstein
and V.M. Strakhovenko [14] put the results of C.J. Horowitz
and H.O. Meyer fundamentally into question. However, their
conclusion about the transfer of the spin of electrons to nucle-
ons is incorrect since it is based on nonrelativistic spin transfer
coefﬁcients instead of a full QED calculation with the complete
interaction Hamiltonian.

We propose in this paper the interaction of an antiproton
beam in a storage ring with a parallel moving polarised elec-
tron beam. It is shown with an ab-initio-QED calculation in
section 2 that the spin exchange cross section becomes larger
by a factor of about 100 than the results of C.J. Horowitz and
H.O. Meyer [11] for small relative energies.

In principle the spin transfer from electrons to nucleons has
been calculated in the framework of QED since a long time
[15,16,17,18,19] and extensively used for the measurement of

the electric form factor of the neutron and proton (see e.g. [20,
21]). However, these calculations are badly adapted to the sit-
uation of the interaction of an electron beam and an antipro-
ton beam in a storage ring at small energies. These calcula-
tions were not intended for small energies where one expects
the large spin exchange cross sections and disregard Coulomb
distortions. Consequently, they cannot be applied in this most
signiﬁcant kinematical range.

After the new calculations of the cross sections have been
sketched in section 2 we present in section 3 a discussion of
electron guns of polarised electrons based on existing technol-
ogy which will be shown to sufﬁce for a realistic scheme in
storage rings in section 4. In section 5 we discuss the ﬁgure-of-
merit for the different proposals and design examples.

For the scattering of an unpolarised spin-one-half hadron (here
proton or antiproton) on a polarised electron, described by a
density matrix ρe, the general expression for the polarisation of
the outgoing hadron is given in the centre-of-momentum (c.m.)

As already mentioned, at those low energies considered here,
Coulomb effects cannot be neglected. In [11] these were in-
cluded approximately by using the exact non-relativistic Coulomb
amplitude for the spin-independent part while multiplying the
hyperﬁne amplitude solely by the Coulomb wave function at
the origin. In the present work, we have evaluated the hyper-
ﬁne interaction in a distorted wave approximation, i.e. replac-
ing the incoming and outgoing plane waves by the correspond-
ing distorted Coulomb waves. This then leads to the following

2.3 Results for the integrated spin transfer cross
section

As a prototype we show

The various polarisation transfer cross sections have been in-
tegrated over the solid angle up to a minimal scattering angle
which is determined by the requirement that the impact param-
eter should not exceed 1010 fm. The dominant spin transfer
cross sections are the ones for the combinations xx, yy and zz.
dσPzz in ﬁg. 1 for the Born ap-
proximation and with inclusion of Coulomb effects for both
the Horowitz-Meyer approximation and the DWBA. It turns
out that Coulomb effects lead to a strong suppression below
1 MeV kinetic energy of the antiprotons in the lab system.
But the Horowitz-Meyer approximation overestimates largely
the Coulomb effects leading to almost vanishing cross sections
with decreasing energy. On the other hand, the DWBA gives
still sizeable cross sections exhibiting an oscillatory behaviour
with increasing amplitude for decreasing kinetic energy of the
antiproton.

R

It sufﬁces to show hσPzzi only because ﬁrstly we ﬁnd in

our evaluation

hσPyyi ≈ hσPzzi ,

where we denote the integrated cross sections as

hσPiii =

dσPii .

Z

Secondly, because the scalar part is completely negligible, the
cross section is dominated by the tensor contribution. Now,
since the trace of the tensor part vanishes, one has the simple
relation

hσPxxi = −(hσPyyi + hσPzzi) ≈ −2hσPzzi ,

(19)

and thus hσPxxi is also determined. We would like to remark
that above a kinetic energy of 10 MeV the Coulomb effects die
out rapidly with increasing energy. At 10 MeV the DWBA re-
sult amounts to hσPzzi = −0.86 barn compared to −0.55 barn
for the Horowitz-Meyer approximation. At 100 MeV both ap-
proach the Born result within 15%.

3 Source of polarised electrons

3.1 General considerations

Highly polarised electron beams are produced via photoemis-
sion from III/V semiconductor heterostructures like strained-
GaAs or super-lattices [24,25]. Such a photocathode yields a
longitudinally polarised electron beam which may, however,
be adjusted to the direction most convenient and efﬁcient by
means of a spin rotator after the source. As will be shown in
section 4.2 an efﬁcient polarisation will require approximately
1 A peak current with an average of 30 mA of polarised elec-
trons at about 100 keV kinetic energy. The parameters for the

pulsed operation required are well below those of existing po-
larised electron sources, as e.g. at SLAC [26,27].

The main problem of a polarised electron source is the sta-
bility of the photocathode. The salient parameter here is the
quantum efﬁciency deﬁned as the number of emitted electrons
per incident photon. As the lifetime of the photocathode we
want to understand the time interval in which the quantum ef-
ﬁciency is decaying to 1/e of the initial value.

The major limitation of the photocathode lifetime is caused
by the ionisation of the residual gas in the acceleration stage
in front of the source. These ions are accelerated towards the
cathode and destroy it by radiation damage. With the present
MAMI polarised source an integrated charge of about 200 C
is routinely observed [28] just right to allow one polarisation
cycle of 1.5 hours to 50% polarisation with the design example
of an antiproton polariser presented in section 4.2.

The ion bombardment can be reduced by improving the
vacuum conditions. A base pressure of less than 10−12 mbar
is possible [29] a factor of 30 better than in the present MAMI
set-up. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect charge lifetimes of
2000 C or 10 polarisation cycles before the photocathode has
to be regenerated.

An additional feature of the MAMI source is the possibility
of a fast replacement of the photocathodes, so that one cathode
can be regenerated while another is producing polarised beam
[30]. In this way a continuous operation is possible since the
cathodes can be exchanged in less than one hour.

If one raises the laser power, one has, however, to worry
about possible nonlinear effects which would not allow to con-
serve the charge lifetime for the currents required here. In the
remainder of this section we present therefore the results of
high current beam tests under realistic excitation conditions.
These experiments reveal that ’nonlinear’ effects indeed exist,
but that they can be kept under control.

3.2 Beam tests

Bulk-GaAs Photocathodes were excited by a high power (up
to 15 W dc) semiconductor laser operating at 1.53 eV photon
energy, the initial quantum efﬁciency was typically 4 to 5%
corresponding to a photosensitivity of about 26 to 33 mA/W.
The laser beam was focused to 2.5 mm diameter onto the cath-
ode surface. For the cathodes used in this experiment the po-
larisation is ≈ 25%. However, for the given photon energy
a polarised beam with P > 80% at 1% quantum efﬁciency
can be obtained if a state of the art super-lattice cathode is
used. Recent successes in the development of resonance en-
hanced super-lattices indicate that the quantum efﬁciency of
such structures can be increased to at least 3% without com-
promising polarisation [31]. Our experiments were carried out
with a copy of the MAMI polarised electron source followed
by a three meter long beam transport line ending in a water
cooled Faraday cup. Typical average currents were 1 to 2 mA,
beam transmission from the source to the cup was larger than
99.8%.

We have made two observations which tend to decrease the
charge lifetime. The ﬁrst is cathode heating since an increase
of the temperature above 350 K leads to a rapid degradation of
the quantum efﬁciency. This effect is probably related to the

decomposition of the Caesium-Oxide activation layer on the
cathode surface. However, it represents no problem for a source
with optimised thermal capabilities which can cope with up to
4.2 W average incident laser power. This power is needed to
produce an average current of 30 mA at the end of the photo-
cathode lifetime when only 1/e of the initial 3% quantum ef-
ﬁciency is left. Thermal coefﬁcients of 15 K/W have already
been demonstrated for a photocathode at TSR Heidelberg while
operating at 90 K [32]. In our present test experiments the re-
striction to a maximum average current of 2 mA is due to the
absence of any cooling devices.

A second phenomenon seems to be related to ion trapping
by the beam potential in the transport line. This leads to an in-
creased axial ﬂow of ions towards the photocathode that is not
proportional to the current. We were able to improve the charge
lifetime by suppressing the ion ﬂow with a repelling electrode
of +65 V potential with respect to the beam tube installed di-
rectly behind the anode of the source. Thus, if we operate in a
regime which is compliant with the thermal limitation we see
no decrease of the charge lifetime up to average currents of
2 mA.

We also have operated in pulsed mode at 16 mA peak cur-
rent with 0.5 ms pulse length and 100 Hz repetition rate. Again,
no decrease of charge lifetime was observed.

We are therefore convinced that charge lifetimes of 200 C,
as they have been demonstrated at lower currents, can also
be achieved with the existing MAMI source while operating
at average currents of 30 mA equivalent to peak currents of
1200 mA. A tenfold improvement of the charge lifetime and,
therefore, reliable operation at 30 mA average current over up
to 20 hours is well within reach with todays technology if one
would build a new source with a better vacuum system, a cool-
ing of the cathode and a higher laser power.

4 Realisation in a storage ring

After the two essential ingredients, the polarisation-transfer cross
sections and the source of polarised electrons have been pre-
sented, we want to show how one can build an antiproton po-
lariser based on them. The basic idea is to let the two beams
move in parallel with a small relative velocity, i.e. a small rela-
tive kinetic energy, and take advantage of the large spin-transfer
cross section of the electrons to the antiprotons in forward di-
rection making up for the relatively low density of the beam of
polarised electrons.

4.1 Polarisation build-up

Firstly, we want to calculate the polarisation build-up in the
ring. We go into the rest frame of the circulating electron beam
and can use the results of section 2 directly since the cross sec-
tions transform as scalars. The quantities in this system are in-
dicated by primes.

Since we want to transport the polarised electron beam with
a diameter of 2mm by means of a longitudinal solenoid we
chose the longitudinal spin direction though the transverse cross
sections are larger by a factor of two. This means one has to

provide a Siberian snake in the ring for rotating the spin longi-
tudinally at the entrance of the solenoid after one circulation.
In principle one could also use transverse polarisation with al-
ternating ﬁeld solenoids [33] as they are in use at MAMI. How-
ever, since they had to be run at the technical limits we do not
consider this option here.

where N0 is the constant number of beam particles in the ring.
The helicities h± can be calculated from the electron polari-
sation Pe deﬁned analogously to eq. (20) resulting in h+ =
(1/2)(1 + Pe) and h− = (1/2)(1 − Pe). Using eq. (30) one
ﬁnds from eqs. (28) or (29) the differential equation for the
beam polarisation build-up

The polarisation of the antiprotons is deﬁned as:

Pbeam =

N + − N −
N + + N −

(20)

with the solution

˙Pb = κ(Pe − Pb)

The rate of change of one spin direction of the total number of
antiprotons in the ring N0 = N + + N − is given by:

Pb = Pe{1 − exp(−κt)}

Now we have to Lorentz transform this equation to the ring

tron density is given by n′
e = neγbeam due to the length con-
traction, secondly, the time dilatation gives a factor of 1/γbeam
on the right hand side of eq. (22) cancelling with the previous

Further the rate of eq. (22) has to be multiplied by the ratio

If one erroneously assumes ˙N + = κPeN + and ˙N − = −κPeN −
violating the relation ˙N + = − ˙N − following from eq. (30) one
gets directly from eq. (20) Pb = tanh(κPet) as in ref. [10]. It
is evident that this formula cannot be correct by realising that
one cannot produce a 100% polarised antiproton beam with an
electron polarisation of less than 100%.

The intense beam of an electron cooler is unpolarised. Since
the calculation of the spin transfer cross section hσPzzi can-
not be performed at an kinetic energy Ekin → 0 as given for
the cooler one may worry about the depolarising effect of the
cooler. We assume that the cooler has a different κ than the
polariser. Then it is straight forward to derive the effect of the
cooler beam by extending eq. (31) and realising that Pe = 0 for
the cooler:

˙Pb = −κcoolerPb + κpolariser(Pe − Pb).

The solution of this differential equation is easily found:

Pb =

PB2

In this subsection we give two examples of an application of the
parallel beam method for polarising antiprotons. The ﬁrst is a
specialised polariser ring optimised for fast polarisation build-
up adequate for an external ﬁxed target experiment requiring
a slowly extracted beam suited for the experiments mentioned
under “1. Spectroscopy of hadrons” and “2. Antinucleon-nucleon
scattering and reactions” in the introduction. The second is the
exploitation of the method in an experimental storage ring simi-
lar to the HESR in ref. [5] as suited for “3. Antinucleon-nucleon
interactions at the parton level” in order to allow for a direct
comparison of the performance with the scheme presented in
ref. [12]. It is, however, not the purpose of this paper to present
elaborated proposals for the two applications. There are too
many interlinked parameters and constraints coming from the
experiments and the accelerator limitations. Some of the limi-
tations and needs for studies in the future will be discussed in
section 5.

electron beam in ring system

4.2.1 Specialised polariser ring

First we want to present a specialised polariser ring optimised
for fast polarisation build-up. We start with the parameters of
the example PB1 in Table 2 which is close to cooler rings built
before as e.g. LEAR (see [34] and references therein) or the
TSR [7]. This design represents a reasonable compromise be-
tween size and cost. We have chosen the maximum in the cross
section of 270 barn at the relative kinetic energy of 0.65 keV
(see ﬁg. 1). If we assume a freely coasting beam and in accord
with the discussion in section 3 an average electron current of
hIei = 32 m A and all other parameters as given in Table 2 we
get from eq. (27) κ = 1/(56 h). Assuming an electron polarisa-
tion of 80% we get according to eq. (32) (see Fig. 2 for a = 0)
an antiproton polarisation of 50% after 56 hours. This is pro-
hibitively long. However, we can make a more efﬁcient use of
the polarised electrons by bunching the antiprotons to a bunch
of lb = 2 m length and switch the electron source with the laser
synchronously to the passing antiproton bunch. As discussed
in section 3 only the integrated current or the “charge lifetime”
counts for the lifetime of the cathode and no additional limits
occur for this pulsed mode. However, in this way we gain the
ratio lb/L or a factor of 37.5 resulting in a polarisation time of
1.5 hours.

In the rest of this section we want to discuss in turn a few
aspects of the storage ring dynamics in order to show that for
the parameters in the Table 2 a safe operation is possible.

The realisation of a compression by a factor of 37.5 just
by adiabatic bunch compression in a single rf-section at the
circulation frequency (h=1) is very ambitious. A more real-
istic scheme is the bunching of the beam by “adiabatic mov-
ing barrier compression” [35] and a subsequent transfer of the
bunched beam into a e.g. h=15 rf-section. A simpler possibility
is the bunching of the beam in another ring of the antiproton ac-
cumulator chain and to transfer the bunch into a h=15 rf-bucket
of the polariser ring.

design. But rough estimates show that no dangerous regions for
this proposed storage ring are approached.

The incoherent tune shift spread ∆Q for our design ex-
ample is calculated with eq. (1). For N ∆Q = 3 · 108 we get
∆Q = 0.016 well in accord with running conditions in exist-
ing similar storage rings. ∆Q is one of the critical parameters
of the parallel beam method and limits the number of antipro-
tons in the ring. It may be possible to go to larger ∆Q than
0.016 in a specially optimised ring lattice but we did not inves-
tigate such an optimisation.

There are some limits as the Keil-Schnell limit of microwave
instabilities, intra beam scattering, and the static electron in-
duced tune shift which had to be studied in detail in a complete

This means that the polariser ring could be ﬁlled at the rate
of 107 ¯p/s in about 0.5 minutes and then polarise antiprotons
in 1.5 hours, i.e. one polarisation time τpol = 1/κ, to a polar-

isation of 0.5 or in two polarisation times to 0.7 (see ﬁg. 2).
The integrated charge for one polarisation time is 170 C well
in accord with the charge lifetimes of the source discussed in
section 3.

The relative kinetic energy T = 0.65 keV has been chosen
for the maximum of hσPzzi in the cross section. The maxima
in the oscillating cross sections are narrow and one has to worry
about the beam stability in order to stay safely in the polarising
maximum. Assuming a relative energy spread of ±10−3 easily
maintained in a storage ring at all phases of injection, storage
and ejection one arrives at an relative energy spread of ±1.1 ·
10−2 for Ekin = 0.65 keV. (In the example PB2 presented in
section 4.2.2 the relative energy spread is ±2.7 · 10−2). This is
quite good enough.

The region of overlap of the antiproton beam and polarised
electron beam is assumed to have a length of 2 m. In order to
achieve a good efﬁciency we want to have a high density of
polarised electrons and this means an as small cross section of
this region as possible. If we want to maintain a diameter of
the electron beam we have to provide focusing for the electron
beam by means of a solenoid. For the emittance of the electron
beam of 12 π mm mrad and a density of about 2 · 1016 m−3 for
the pulsed electron beam one has to compensate for the space
charge effect and needs a ﬁeld of about 0.1 T in order to main-
tain the beam diameter of 2 mm. For the design example PB2 in
the next subsection 4.2.2 a ﬁeld of 0.075 T is needed. However,
beam transfer with a solenoid in such situations represents no
problem and has been demonstrated before.

For this beam diameter we estimate a minimal value of the
beta function βmin of the antiproton beam in mid overlap ac-
cording to

βmin =

l/2
p2 − 1

(35)

p
where p = de/d0 with de the beam diameter at the entrance
and exit and d0 the diameter at the mid point of the overlap
region. With p = 1.1 of we obtain β0 >2.2 m. With this value
and a beam diameter of 2 mm we get from the relation

σx,y =

βx,y εx,y

(36)

p
εx,y = 0.45 mm mrad as emittance for the antiproton beam. This
means that we have to cool the antiproton beam after injec-
tion before we can efﬁciently polarise. The cooling has to stay
on during polarisation build-up in order to compensate for the
intra-beam scattering and the multiple scattering in the rest gas
of the ring. Emittances of about 0.1 mm mrad have been ob-
tained at LEAR and other cooler rings for up to 109 particles in
the ring.

4.2.2 HESR as polariser ring

As seen in the previous section 4.2.1 one limitation of the paral-
lel beam method comes from incoherent tune shift spread. One
can, however, just go to higher antiproton velocities and gain
considerably as seen from eq. 1. The apparent disadvantage of
the need for a storage ring with higher bending power is actu-
ally an advantage since one could put the polarising electron
beam directly in the experimental storage ring, as e.g. HESR,

and could renounce on the expensive separate polariser ring.
The design example PB2 designed for the nominal value γ = 2
takes up this idea. Table 2 shows again the salient parameters.
As seen all parameters are within the safe operating region and
the allowed number of particles goes up by a factor of 5. The
bunching factor is about the same as for PB1, only the interac-
tion length has been increased by a factor of two still feasible
with a loss of a factor 1.4 due to reduced overlap if one does
not change βbeam. But such factors are within the margin of the
considerations here. They have to be optimised in a real com-
plete design. The polarisation time τpol = 1/κ is now 5 hours,
half the time of one beam lifetime in HESR of 10 hours, and
will be used as the basis for a comparison of the performance
of the two methods presented in the next section 5.

5 Discussion and Conclusions

Now we want to compare the internal target method (IT) [12]
with the parallel beam method (PB) of this article on the basis
of the ﬁgure-of-merit FOM = Nb · P 2
b . For the internal beam
method (IT) we assume a ﬁlling time of 1 hour since it needs
many antiprotons in order to make up for the many particles
lost due to Coulomb scattering and annihilation. This means
that 9 hours are left for polarisation build-up. Further, the num-
bers of Table 1 are used.

For the parallel beam method PB1, i.e. polarisation in a sep-
arate polariser ring, we can ﬁll the ring in 2 minutes and con-
sequently ﬁll and polarise 3 times in 10 hours. Therefore, the
FOM has been multiplied by a factor 3. With a polarisation time
of tP = 3.3 hours we can polarise up to κpolarisertP = 2.2 and
reach a polarisation of the antiprotons of 0.72.

For the parallel beam method PB2 we assume a polarisa-
tion time of 5 hours using the HESR as polarisation ring. This
means that one cannot use the ring for experiments about half
of the time assuming a beam life time in HESR of 10 hours.
However, if one would polarise and perform the experiment
in parallel, one could do routine detector checks mandatory
for precision measurements in the ﬁrst half of the life time
of small polarisation and do the real experiment in the second
half. For such a scheme the average polarisation over the sec-
ond half of the polarisation time is 0.614 and the average FOM
= 0.6142 · 3 · 109 = 1.1 · 109 with Pe = 0.8. Consequnetly, the
FOM in Table 3 has been devided by a factor of 2.

Table 3 shows the comparison:

So far we have optimised the design examples of the par-
allel beam method for large polarisation and short polarisa-
tion times. However, we could, as in ref. [12], optimise for
the maximum of the FOM with respect to the bunching factor
B = L/lb. If we take the limit of the number of antiprotons
given by the incoherent tune shift spread and the polarisation
build-up according eq. (32) we get

FOM(B) =

(Pe{1 − exp(−κ0Bt0)})2.

where N0 is the number of antiprotons according to eq. (1) for
B=1, i.e. the coasting beam mentioned already in section 4.2,
κ0 the polarisation constant for the coasting beam, and t0 the
polarisation time for a certain design situation, as e.g. the 10
hours of the HESR example discussed before. Fig. 3 shows
FOM and Pb as a function of the bunching factor B for the
design example PB1. If we take the bunching factor at the max-

accumulate systematically false asymmetries. Therefore, ex-
ample ITa and ITb are rather unattractive for precision experi-
ments. On the other hand side, one can switch the sign of the
polarisation of the electron beam of the parallel beam method
with a frequency of 4 MHz. If one takes several bunches in the
polariser ring one can polarise them in an alternative or even
statistical sequence allowing for a powerful control of system-
atic errors.

It appears that the parallel beam method is clearly supe-
rior over any other method proposed so far since it provides a
high polarisation and a competitive ﬁgure of merit at low in-
vestment. It should be experimentally veriﬁed at an existing
storage ring as soon as possible in view of the importance for
the planning at FAIR. The higher ﬂexibility results in possibly a
considerable higher cost efﬁciency. It has not been attempted to
ﬁnd the optimum solution for FAIR due to a limited knowledge
of the ongoing discussion.

The parallel beam method for polarising antiprotons has

perimental difﬁculties of experiments with beams of low po-
larisation. Particularly for such cases, as for the internal target
method, for which the polarisation cannot be switched quickly
one needs a very stable accelerator and detector in order to not

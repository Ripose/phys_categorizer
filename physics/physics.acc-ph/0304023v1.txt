(Dated: November 27, 2012)

By concern of compression of charge density ﬁeld, the corrected Lorentz force formula and con-
sequent inference is presented. And further radiation frequency property of an individual charge
density ﬁeld in magnetic dipole is analyzed respectively for radiant property of the charged particle
and the emitted electromagnetic wave transfer property between the moving radiant source and ob-
server. As results, the behavior and radiation frequency property of the electron beam in magnetic
dipole is interpreted upon the individual’s behavior and property. At ﬁnal, the potential application
is put forward for wider interest.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In view point of electrical charge density ﬁeld [1], Lorentz interaction of individual charge and magnetic ﬁeld can
happen only in a speciﬁed space — overlapped volume of the charge density ﬁeld and magnetic ﬁeld. When the
volume is in compressed status or varies with a change of the charge internal potential energy due to energy exchange,
the Lorentz force will be aﬀected since the magnetic action amount is proportion to the volume; consequently the
centrifugal force’s variation will result in the angular velocity’s variation and radiant power’s of the charged particle.
By considering the charge’s internal structure and compressed status, Lorentz force correcting factor is studied. In
addition, for the Lorentz force to work for causing electromagnetic radiation, there will be a corresponding property
on the radiation frequency of a single particle during a single pass; however on the radiation property involving the
particle’s radiant frequency, observer detecting frequency and radiant power, currently relevant study is not complete
and explicit yet in some points for neglecting the charge’s micro-structure and undistinguishing the particle charge
itself’s radiation in magnetic ﬁeld from detecting radiation at observer location [2, 3, 4], while it is one of our studying
subjects following. Further based on the new results of Lorentz force correction and radiation frequency property for
single charged particle in magnetic dipole, we give a qualitative interpretation on the relevant behavior or property of
collectively charged particles or macro beam element during it passes through a magnetic dipole, and discuss verifying
method on our theorem as well as important application.

II. DERIVATION OF THE CORRECT RELATION AND INFERENCE

A. Corrected Formula of Lorentz Force

For a micro charge element within a charge density ﬁeld, where dqi = ρi(t)dVi(t) = ρoi(roic)dVoi(roic) and
ρ0(roic)dV0(roic) = q (Ref. [1]), there exists a corrected Lorentz force exerted on the dqi

ρ[ric(t)]dV =

In frame ﬁxated on the particle, according to the fact that the rate of line velocity, denoted as a//(t), results
from centrifugal acceleration a⊥(t), in other words a//(t) is determined by a⊥(t) and its value is just proﬁle of the
centrifugal acceleration on ~n⊥r direction.

So there

where
to substitute a//(t) = ˙ρωρ(t), a⊥(t) = v(t)ωρ(t) to Eq. (7), then

direction for Lorentz deﬂection or Lorentz force to work, the other in opposite direction of the displacement for
created radiant magnetic ﬁeld to oppose against the Lorentz work and convert the work into horizontal polarized
electromagnetic radiation in tangential direction of the particle’s trajectory.

A. Lorentz force, in a complete inertial frame, is particle’s total energy related

For a single charged particle, its energy Es(t) = mq

2 v2(t) + ¯µq[¯η(t) + e−¯η(t) − 1]
(Ref. [8]) relates to corrected Lorentz force as centrifugal force ~fρ(t) = q~v(t) × ~B(t)¯k(t); where ~v(t) reﬂects that the
force is particle’s kinetic energy related, and ¯k(t) = e−¯η(t) shows the corrected force is also particle charge’s internal
potential energy related.

2 v2(t) + ¯µq[ln ¯k−1(t) + ¯k(t) − 1] = mq

Interpretation on behavior and radiation property of electron beam in magnetic dipole

A. Beam’s horizontal size decreasing

This is because individual’s charge density ﬁeld is compressed by two opposite electrical ﬁelds (Ref. III A) along

centrifugal direction or ~nr(t). The compression contributes to decreasing space charge eﬀect along this direction.

B. Decreasing of beam’s longitudinal kinetic energy spread

This is because along ~n⊥r(t) there exists ∂v(t,z)

∂z < 0; thus along the longitudinal direction beam’s internal force

increase, that help to improve the kinetic energy spread and increase internal potential energy.

C. Application

V. CONCLUSION

For beam the observer frequency width will be wider than single’s due to energy spread of the electron beam.

A. Corrected Lorentz force formula can be used to calculate angular frequency and its rate of charged particle in
storage ring or cyclotron directly without supposing mass’s increasing or decreasing of particle as particle’s energy
varies. (Ref. Eq. (5′) (5′′))

B. The frequency property can be applied to analyze relevant astronomical electromagnetic wave source.

Lorentz force in magnetic ﬁeld is corrected by charge ﬁeld’s compression factor which manifests charge density
ﬁeld’s internal potential energy status. The radiation frequency property of individual charged particle in magnetic
ﬁeld is consisted of two characteristics, radiant frequency property due to Lorentz deﬂection radiation and detecting or
observing frequency property which is determined by time function of signal transportation between time domains of
radiant source and observer. Consequently the behavior and radiation property of electron beam can be interpreted
upon the behavior and radiation property of single charged particle.
In addition based on the corrected Lorentz
force formula, it is inferred that the angular frequency or velocity of a charged particle in magnetic dipole is timely
independent to its mass but its total energy status or speciﬁcally its internal potential energy status that relates the
charge ﬁeld’s compression status.

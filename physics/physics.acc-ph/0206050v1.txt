Abstract

We consider an application of modiﬁcation of our variational-wavelet approach to some
nonlinear collective model of beam/plasma physics: Vlasov/Boltzmann-like reduction from
general BBGKY hierachy related to modeling of propagation of intense charged particle
beams in high-intensity accelerators and transport systems. We use fast convergent multiscale
variational-wavelet representations for solutions which allow to consider polynomial and ra-
tional type of nonlinearities. The solutions are represented via the multiscale decomposition
in nonlinear high-localized eigenmodes (waveletons). In contrast with different approaches
we do not use perturbation technique or linearization procedures.

Abstract

We consider an application of modiﬁcation of our va-
riational-wavelet approach to some nonlinear collective
model of beam/plasma physics: Vlasov/Boltzmann-like re-
duction from general BBGKY hierachy related to modeling
of propagation of intense charged particle beams in high-
intensity accelerators and transport systems. We use fast
convergent multiscale variational-wavelet representations
for solutions which allow to consider polynomial and ratio-
nal type of nonlinearities. The solutions are represented via
the multiscale decomposition in nonlinear high-localized
eigenmodes (waveletons).
In contrast with different ap-
proaches we do not use perturbation technique or lineariza-
tion procedures.

INTRODUCTION

We consider applications of numerical–analytical tech-
nique based on modiﬁcation of our variational-wavelet
approach to nonlinear collective models of beam/plasma
physics, e.g. some forms of Vlasov/Boltzmann-like reduc-
tions from general BBGKY hierarchy (section 2). These
equations are related to the modeling of propagation of
intense charged particle beams in high-intensity accelera-
tors and transport systems [1], [2].
In our approach we
use fast convergent multiscale variational-wavelet repre-
sentations, which allows to consider polynomial and ra-
tional type of nonlinearities [3]-[16], [17]. The solutions
are represented via the multiscale decomposition in non-
linear high-localized eigenmodes (generalized Gluckstern
modes, in some sense), which corresponds to the full mul-
tiresolution expansion in all underlying hidden time/space
or phase space scales. In contrast with different approaches
we don’t use perturbation technique or linearization pro-
cedures. In section 3 after formulation of key points we
consider another variational approach based on ideas of
para-products and nonlinear approximation in multiresolu-
tion approach, which gives the possibility for computations
in each scale separately [18]. We consider representation
(4) below, where each term corresponds to the contribution
from the scale i in the full underlying multiresolution de-
composition as multiscale generalization of old (nonlinear)
δF approach [1]. As a result, fast scalar/parallel modeling
demonstrates appearance of high-localized coherent struc-
tures (waveletons) and pattern formation in systems with
complex collective behaviour.

F2(x1, x2; t) =

where partial Liouvillean operators are described in [17].
We are interested in the cases when

Fk(x1, . . . , xk; t) =

F1(xi; t) + Gk(x1, . . . , xk; t),

where Gk are correlation patterns, really have additional
reductions as in case of Vlasov-like systems. Then we have
in (2), (3) polynomial type of nonlinearities (more exactly,
multilinearities).

3 MULTISCALE ANALYSIS

Our goal is the demonstration of advantages of the fol-

lowing representation

F =

δiF,

Xi∈Z

(4)

for the full exact solution for the systems related to equa-
tions (2), (3). It is possible to consider (4) as multiscale
generalization of old (nonlinear) δF approach [1]. In (4)
each δiF term corresponds to the contribution from the
scale i in the full underlying multiresolution decomposi-
tion

. . . ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V2 . . .

(5)

of the proper function space (L2, Hilbert, Sobolev, etc) to
which F is really belong. It should be noted that (4) doesn’t
based neither on perturbations nor on linearization proce-
dures. Although usually physicists, who prefered computer
modelling as a main tool of understanding of physical re-
ality, don’t think about underlying functional spaces, but
many concrete features of complicated complex dynamics
are really related not only to concrete form/class of opera-
tors/equations but also depend on the proper choice of func-
tion spaces where operators actully act. Moreover, we have
for arbitrary N in the ﬁnite N-mode approximation

F N =

δiF

N

Xi=1

the following more useful decompositions:

We modify the scheme of our variational approach in such
a way in which we consider different scales of multiresolu-
tion decomposition (5) separately. For this reason we need
to compute errors of approximations. The main problems
come of course from nonlinear (polynomial) terms. We
follow according to the multilinearization (in case below –
bilinearization) approach of Beylkin, Meyer etc from [18].
Let Pj be projection operators on the subspaces Vj (5):

(Pj f )(x) =

< f, ϕj,k > ϕj,k(x)

(9)

Xk

(6)

and Qj are projection operators on the subspaces Wj:
Qj = Pj−1 − Pj. So, for u ∈ L2(R) we have uj = Pj u
and uj ∈ Vj . It is obviously that we can represent u2
following form:

0 in the

{F (t)} =

group of translations and dilations (the so called “wavelet
microscope”). The following constructions based on varia-
tional approach provide the best possible fast convergence
properties in the sense of combined norm

introduced in [17]. Our ﬁve basic points after functional
space choice are:

1. Ansatz-oriented choice of the (multidimensional) ba-
ses related to some polynomial tensor algebra. Some
example related to general BBGKY hierarchy is con-
sidered in [17].

2. The choice of proper variational principle. A few
projection/ Galerkin-like principles for constructing
(weak) solutions are considered in [3] - [16].
It
should be noted advantages of formulations related to
biorthogonal (wavelet) decomposition.

3. The choice of bases functions in scale spaces Wj
from wavelet zoo. They correspond to high-localized
(nonlinear) oscillations/excitations, coherent (nonlin-
ear) resonances, etc. Besides fast convergence prop-
erties of the corresponding variational-wavelet expan-
sions it should be noted minimal complexity of all un-
derlying calculations, especially in case of choice of
wavelet packets which minimize Shannon entropy.

4. Operators representations providing maximum sparse
representations for arbitrary (pseudo) differential/ in-
tegral operators df /dx, dnf /dxn,
T (x, y)f (y)dy),
etc [17].

R

In this formula there is no interaction between different
scales. We may consider each term of (10) as a bilinear
mappings:

M j

V W : Vj × Wj → L2(R) = Vj ⊕j′≥jWj′

(11)

M j

W W : Wj × Wj → L2(R) = Vj ⊕j′≥j Wj′

(12)

For numerical purposes we need formula (10) with a ﬁnite
number of scales, but when we consider limits j → ∞ we
have

(2Pju + Qju)(Qju),

(13)

u2 =

Xj∈Z

which is para-product of Bony, Coifman and Meyer [18].
Now we need to expand (10) into the wavelet bases. To
expand each term in (10) we need to consider the integrals
of the products of the basis functions (7), e.g.

′

M j,j

W W W (k, k′, ℓ) =

k(x)ψj
ψj

k′ (x)ψj

(14)

where j′ > j and

k(x) = 2−j/2ψ(2−jx − k)
ψj

(15)

are the basis functions (7).

′

M j,j

W W W (k, k′, ℓ) ≡ 0 for

|k − k′| > k0,

(16)

where k0 depends on the overlap of the supports of the basis
functions and

|M r

W W W (k − k′, 2rk − ℓ)| ≤ C · 2−rλM

5. (Multi)linearization. Besides variation approach we
consider now a different method to deal with (polyno-
mial) nonlinearities.

Let us deﬁne j0 as the distance between scales such that for
a given ε all the coefﬁcients in (17) with labels r = j − j′,
r > j0 have absolute values less than ε. For the purposes

V W : Vj × Wj → Vj ⊕j≤j′≤j0 Wj′

W W : Wj × Wj → Vj ⊕j≤j′≤j0 Wj′
Since Vj ⊕j≤j′≤j0 Wj′ = Vj0−1, Vj ⊂ Vj0−1, Wj ⊂
Vj0−1 we may consider bilinear mappings (18), (19) on
Vj0−1 × Vj0−1. For the evaluation of (18), (19) as map-
pings Vj0−1 × Vj0−1 → Vj0−1 we need signiﬁcantly fewer
coefﬁcients than for mappings (18), (19). It is enough to
consider only coefﬁcients

(20)

where ϕ(x) is scale function. Also we have

M (k, k′, ℓ) = 2−j/2M0(k − ℓ, k′ − ℓ),

(21)

where

M0(p, q) =

ϕ(x − p)ϕ(x − q)ϕ(x)dx

(22)

Z

M0(p, q) satisfy the standard system of linear equations
and after its solution we can recover all bilinear quanti-
ties (14). Then we apply some variation approach from
[3]-[16], but in each scale separately. So, after applica-
tion of points 1-5 above, we arrive to explicit numerical-
analytical realization of representations (4) or (6). Fig.1

demonstrates the ﬁrst contribution to the full solution (6)
while Fig.2 presents (stable) pattern as solution of system
(2)-(3). We evaluate accuracy of calculations according to
norm introduced in [17].

Abstract

Muon cooling is the main technological obstacle in the building of
a muon collider. A muon cooling scheme based on Frictional Cooling
holds promise in overcoming this obstacle. An experiment designed to
demonstrate the Frictional Cooling concept using protons was undertaken.
Although the results were inconclusive in the observation of cooling, the
data allowed for the qualiﬁcation of detailed simulations which are used
to simulate the performance of a muon collider.

1 Introduction

The basic idea of Frictional Cooling[1] is to bring the charged particles into
a kinetic energy range where the energy loss per unit distance increases with
kinetic energy. In its application to a possible muon collider, the cooling channel
is placed in a solenoidal ﬁeld to contain the muons. A constant accelerating force
can be applied to the muons resulting in an equilibrium energy. A sample dT/dx
curve, where T is the kinetic energy, is shown in Fig. 1. The desired condition
can be met for kinetic energies below a few KeV or kinetic energies beyond
about 200 MeV. At the high energy end, the change in dT/dx with energy is
only logarithmic, whereas it is approximately proportional to the speed at low
energies. Below the dT/dx peak, muons are too slow to ionize the atoms in
the stopping medium. The processes leading to energy loss; excitation, elastic
scattering on nuclei and charge exchange reactions, yield diﬀerences for µ+ and
µ−. Operating in this energy regime, an electric ﬁeld can be applied which
compensates for the energy loss. Several issues become apparent:

•

•

dT/dx is very large in this region of kinetic energy, so we need to work
with a low average density (i.e., gas) in order to have a reasonable electric
ﬁeld strength.

ergy range, dominates over the electron stripping cross section in all gases
except helium[2].

There is a measured diﬀerence in the µ+ and µ− energy loss rates near
the peak of the dT/dx spectrum (Barkas eﬀect[3]). This eﬀect is assumed
to be due to extra processes for µ+, such as charge exchange.

A possibly fatal problem for µ− is the eﬃciency loss resulting from muon
capture (µ− + Atom
µAtom + e−). The cross section for this process
has been calculated up to T=80 eV[4] but has not been measured. The
measurement of this cross section is a critical path item to the realization
of a muon collider based on Frictional Cooling. Hydrogen and helium are
the best candidate media.

→

Despite some reported evidence for Frictional Cooling[1], it is clear that much
more information is needed if this is to become a useful technique for phase
space reduction of beams. We have therefore planned a series of experiments
to understand the Frictional Cooling process in detail. The results described in
this paper are the ﬁrst measurements in this program.

As a ﬁrst step, we plan to study the emittance achievable for protons in such
a scheme. The behavior exhibited in Fig. 1 is typical for all charged particles.
The Frictional Cooling approach should work for a variety of charged particles,
including protons (the stopping power for protons in helium is shown in Fig. 2).
An experiment was performed using protons in order to demonstrate the
behavior of charged particles in this low energy regime. This experiment had
several goals: demonstrating frictional cooling; benchmarking the simulations,
and employing many of the experimental components, detectors, etc., which
would be needed in future experimentation with muons.

Using protons simpliﬁes the experiment considerably, as they are easily pro-
duced and are stable particles. A time of ﬂight experiment was devised employ-
ing start and stop detectors, an electric ﬁeld and a gas cell with thin entrance
and exit windows.

2 RAdiological Research Accelerator Facility (RARAF)

RARAF is dedicated to research in radio-biology and radiological physics and
is located at Nevis Laboratories, in Irvington, N.Y.1 RARAF has a 4 MeV
Van de Graaﬀ accelerator, which produces beams of positive light ions. The
beam provided by RARAF for this experiment was diatomic hydrogen with one
electron stripped (H +
2 breaks
up in the ﬁrst trigger detector resulting in an eﬀective initial beam of protons
800 KeV. H +
with energies in the range of 650
2 was used since the ion source
and accelerator tube have higher eﬃciency for H +
2 than for protons at the lower
energy reach of the accelerator. The demands made on the beam were not

(1

15 pA) suitable for our ﬁrst trigger detector.

3 Detailed Simulations

The tracking of protons through various materials was implemented using stand-
alone fortran code. Muonium formation, µ− capture, muon decay and processes
speciﬁcally aﬀecting muon energy loss are included in this simulation. Although
the detailed simulations were written with muons in mind, the program can track
any charged particle.

The two processes which concern the proton simulations are the electronic

and nuclear energy loss processes. Hydrogen formation was not implemented.

The energy loss from nuclear scattering of protons with kinetic energies be-
low 50 KeV was calculated and coded using the Everhart et al.[5] prescription
for generating scattering.
Individual nuclear scatters are simulated. For en-
ergies above 50 KeV, the Born Approximation is used. This procedure was
compared with the dT/dx tables from NIST2 and showed excellent agreement.
The electronic energy loss is treated as continuous and the data are taken from
the NIST tables.

The breakup of the H +

2 was not simulated. The SRIM[6] program was used
to simulate the energy loss of the protons through the 9 µm of silicon in the
timing detector. The transmitted proton energy spectrum from SRIM was then
used as an input to the detailed simulations of the gas cell.

Only a fraction of the delivered protons achieved the equilibrium energy in
the amount of gas available. The rest were too energetic or were lost due to
acceptance issues.

4 Time of Flight (TOF) Experiment Setup

Figure 3 shows the experimental setup. The proton beam was ﬁrst collimated
through a 1 mm hole separating the RARAF beam line from the experimental
section. This collimator, while reducing the delivered current to the experiment,
also acted as a baﬄe protecting the beam line vacuum from degradation as a
result of helium gas which leaked from the gas cell.

The proton beam then hit the ﬁrst timing detector which produced a stop
signal for the TOF measurement. The ﬁrst detector consisted of a D Series
planar totally depleted silicon surface barrier detector from ORTEC3. Frictional
Cooling operates in the region below the ionization peak. Hence from Fig. 2
one can see that only the protons below
(100) KeV had the possibility to be
cooled. The silicon detector acted to degrade the beam energy, adding energy
spread, while also providing the trigger.

After drifting 4.4 cm the protons entered the gas cell through a thin window.
The windows consisted of a
20 nm thick carbon ﬁlm on a nickel grid with
a 55% open area ratio and a diameter of 2.3 mm, as speciﬁed by SPI4. The
windows were inspected and it was discovered that in a few grid spacings the
carbon was perforated. The windows were epoxied between two precision wash-
ers and the sandwich arrangement was further epoxied to the window holders,
designed and built at Nevis Laboratories (See Fig. 4).

∼

The gas cell itself and the support structure for the accelerating grid which
surrounded the gas cell were made of Teﬂon (See Fig. 5). The supporting
structure needed to be non-conducting and Teﬂon was selected as it has a low
vapor pressure.

The gas ﬂow was controlled through a Piezoelectric valve. A calibration
was performed ahead of time, to determine the gas ﬂow rate as a function of
applied voltage, but was found to be unstable in situ. During data taking
the Piezoelectric valve had to be continuously adjusted manually to maintain
a constant cell pressure. There were three feedthroughs into the gas cell: one
was used for the pressure measurement, one for the gas intake and one to open
the gas cell to the vacuum while evacuation was taking place. The system was
in continuous ﬂow as a result of the small imperfections in the windows and
the natural permeability of helium. A Pirani gauge was used to measure the
pressure in the gas cell. This type of gauge is sensitive to the nature of the gas.
Unfortunately its sensitivity for helium pressure measurements is limited in the
desired range of operating conditions. As a result, the operating pressure was
estimated for values greater than 0.004 atm.

The accelerating grid consisted of 30 copper rings with thin (1 mm) Teﬂon
separators. The rings were connected in series by a resistor chain resulting in a
uniform accelerating ﬁeld of 60 KV/m. The distance between the windows in
the gas cell was 9.2 cm. The gas cell was shorter than the accelerating grid by
7.3 cm, which provided for a short reacceleration ﬁeld for protons exiting the
gas cell. Those protons which were not suﬃciently degraded by the silicon and
were not in the energy range suitable for stopping were minimally aﬀected by
the small reacceleration ﬁeld.

The second timing detector, in Fig. 3, was a Micro Channel Plate (MCP)
detector5. There were two plates with a total potential diﬀerence across them
of 1600 V.

5 Trigger and Data Acquisition

The trigger consisted of a coincidence between the two timing detectors. The
Data Acquisition (DAQ) chain was based on fast NIM logic modules and a
CAMAC TDC (See Fig. 6). The TDC had a maximum range of 800 ns. The
silicon detector singles rate was nominally 40 KHz and was kept below 100 KHz
in order to reduce the eﬀect of pile-up and to avoid potential damage to the

detector. The CAMAC readout system could be readout at a maximum rate
of 1 KHz. Hence the signal from the silicon detector was discriminated and
then digitally delayed by
700 ns, an amount comparable to the range of the
TDC, and used as the stop signal. The rate on the MCP detector was much
lower since its geometric acceptance is very small. The MCP signal was used
to trigger the common start of the DAQ system, thereby removing potential
dead time due to the DAQ readout. It was noticed that noise pulses from the
MCP were associated with multiple pulses. A veto was introduced to reduce
this noise by requiring that the MCP triggered pulse be isolated in a window
of 100 ns(see Fig. 6). In other words, the event was rejected if more than one
MCP pulse occurred within 100 ns. The trigger is illustrated in Fig. 7.

6 Datasets

Table 1 summarizes the datasets taken. H +
2 with T = 1.44 MeV was the
nominal running condition. A higher energy, T = 1.6 MeV, run was taken for
comparison. At the higher energy, no cooled protons were expected. Other
lower statistic runs were taken at T = 1.3 MeV and T = 1.5 MeV. Runs were
taken with the accelerating grid on and oﬀ and the gas ﬂow was turned on and
oﬀ for calibration and monitoring purposes.

7 Calibrations

The TDC was calibrated using a pulse generator and gate delay generator as
input to the DAQ chain. The absolute calibration for the time oﬀset, taking
into account the time delays introduced by the detectors, electronics and cables,
was found from three high statistics data runs corresponding to three diﬀerent
distances separating the two timing detectors. The nominal H +
2 beam energy of
1.44 MeV was used for these three calibration runs. For these data sets the entire
gas cell and accelerating grid structures were removed from the experimental
section.

As a result of the trigger conﬁguration illustrated in Fig. 7, increasing dis-
tance of ﬂight led to a smaller TDC value (see Fig. 8). Figure 8 also indicates a
long tail of background which is ﬁt by an exponential with a large time constant.
The tails of the distributions were subtracted before proceeding with the analy-
sis. The peaks were then ﬁt with a gaussian and the means were plotted against
the separation distance in order to extract the oﬀset for the DAQ system. The
calibration is shown in Fig. 9.

The data is compared to the Monte Carlo (MC) expectation in Fig. 10. The
data distribution is broader than the MC expectation but there is good agree-
ment on the location of the peak. The peaks of the distributions correspond
approximately to the ﬂight time required for a proton with the most probable
kinetic energy. The measured time distribution can be better ﬁtted by a con-
volution of the true time distribution with a gaussian, whose σ represents the

8 Analysis

The nominal H +
2 beam energy for the analysis was 1.44 MeV. Since the breakup
of the H +
2 is not simulated and there were uncertainties in the beam energy cal-
ibration, the ﬁrst step was to determine the kinetic energy of the incoming
protons. This was possible using the calibration runs which were taken without
the gas cell and accelerating grid structures. From the calibration plot in Fig. 9
one can extract not only the T0 oﬀset needed to reconstruct the TDC measure-
ments but also the slope of the distribution. The slope of the distribution is
representative of a velocity. The slope of 0.502 cm/ns represents the velocity
for a proton with the most probable kinetic energy after the silicon detector
(136 KeV). The incoming energy was varied in the simulations such that the
output of the SRIM calculations agreed with the values observed in the data.
As shown in Fig. 11, the transmitted energy is a strong function of the incom-
ing energy. An initial proton energy of 721 KeV is needed to produce a most
probable transmitted energy of 136 KeV.

The next step was to determine the eﬀect of the gas cell windows. With the
gas cell and accelerating grid in the beam line, a data run was taken without

diﬀerence in the TOF distribution resulted from the extra energy loss of the
protons in the entrance and exit windows of the gas cell. This data is plotted
in Fig. 12 and compared to the simulation of various window thicknesses. An
eﬀective carbon window thickness of 350 nm reproduced the data much better
than the quoted thickness of 20 nm. The apparent thickness of 350 nm was
more than an order of magnitude larger than what was expected. The eﬀect of
this thick window was to change the expected TOF distributions by adding an
eﬀective lower energy threshold for protons to get through the system. Hence,
no protons which would result in a TOF greater than 400 ns were expected to
penetrate the exit window. This greatly reduced the possibility of observing
cooled protons.

Finally, the pressure of the gas had to be determined from the data since
the pressure gauge was not precise. After adding the gas the MC was tuned
to extract the pressure of the helium gas inside the gas cell. This is shown in
Fig. 13. The MC was ﬁt to the data under these conditions and the probable
pressure of helium gas was found to be
0.01 atm. This was in line with our
readings from the pressure gauge. At a pressure of 0.01 atm, only protons with a
kinetic energy below
80 KeV could reach an equilibrium energy in the density
of gas provided, as seen from our simulations in Fig. 14.

For the H +

2 beam energy of 1.6 MeV, no calibration runs were taken without
the gas cell and accelerating grid structures. The window thickness was ﬁxed in
the MC at 350 nm, and the proton beam energy was then extracted by ﬁtting
the time spectrum for a data run in which the gas was not ﬂowing and the grid
was turned oﬀ. The proton energy was found to be 760 KeV.

Two additional nominal H +

2 energies, 1.3 and 1.5 MeV were used. However,
the conditions were not varied for these energies and single low statistic runs
were taken for each energy with the gas ﬂowing and the accelerating ﬁeld on.
For each run, the proton beam energies were varied in the MC and then ﬁt to
the data distributions.

Cooled protons were searched for in TOF distributions of data runs with the
gas on and the accelerating grid ramped up to produce a ﬁeld of 60 KV/m. The
results are shown in Fig. 15. The narrow peak in all the distributions at 167 ns
was the result of correlated noise in the DAQ system and was removed from the
data. The long tails of background were expected to be ﬂat or a slowly rising
exponential with a large time constant. Cooled protons were expected populate
a region of large TOF between 250 and 400 ns. The background was ﬁt using an
exponential in the region of TOF greater than 500 ns and TOF less than 10 to
50 ns, depending on the proton beam energy, where no protons were expected
from the MC. The 1.3, 1.44 and 1.5 MeV H +
2 data background regions were
consistent with being ﬂat. The 1.6 MeV H +
2 data set was the only data set with
a background exponential ﬁt with a positive time constant. The background
(including correlated noise) subtracted data is shown in Fig. 16.

The MC curve was normalized by ﬁtting the data in the time range of 0 to
400 ns, which corresponds to the protons which do not achieve the equilibrium
energy. The MC expectation was then calculated by integrating the number of
events over a time window. The results are summarized in Table 2. We note
that the MC expectations yield a very small number of cooled protons. This is
in large part due to the eﬀective thickness of the carbon windows. The data is
consistent with no observation of cooled protons, but also compatible with the
expectation from the simulations within the statistical errors.

9 Experimental Challenges and Outlook

The acceptance (including eﬃciency) can be estimated from the ratio of the
MCP to the Si detector rates, and was about 0.01 %. The factors entering into
this number include the geometrical acceptance for passage through the two
2.3 mm windows, possible misalignments of the windows with the MCP, and the
MCP detector eﬃciency. Assuming perfect alignment, a 100 % MCP detector
eﬃciency, and a 55 % transmission probability through the windows due to the
Nickel grid, we calculate an acceptance using our detailed simulations of 0.4 %
for low energy protons. The remaining loss in acceptance was presumably from
misalignment eﬀects and MCP detector ineﬃciency. A magnetic ﬁeld would have
considerably increased the acceptance. For example, we calculate an acceptance
increase of a factor 25 with a 5 T ﬁeld.

7

A further improvement in the experiment would be to remove the win-
dows entirely. The eﬀective window thickness measured in this experiment was
350 nm, as obtained from a comparison of data and simulation results for pro-
ton energy spectra with and without windows present. The cause of the larger
eﬀective window thickness is not known, but may have been due to extensive
exposure to the atmosphere. The eﬀective column density seen by the protons
from the exit window was similar to that from the helium gas. The exit window
therefore set a threshold on the minimum energy which could be extracted from
the gas cell and prevented us from observing low energy protons. Those protons
which had enough energy to pass through the exit window were too energetic
to be cooled in the gas cell.

We are preparing a new experiment in which a gas cell will be placed in a
strong solenoidal ﬁeld. A silicon drift detector will be placed inside the gas cell,
and will directly measure the proton energies without the need for windows.
The large increase in acceptance and sensitivity to low energies should therefore
allow the observation of cooled protons.

10 Conclusions

This experiment was performed to study Frictional Cooling using protons. The
number of cooled protons observed under various conditions was consistent with
zero within large statistical errors. This result was explained by the small
acceptance of the system and the large exit window thickness of our gas cell.

The data allowed for the tuning of untested simulation code. The experi-
mental experience and the reﬁned simulations will be used in the design and
implementation of future experiments.

NONLINEAR ACCELERATOR PROBLEMS VIA WAVELETS:
2. ORBITAL DYNAMICS IN GENERAL MULTIPOLAR FIELD

A. Fedorova, M. Zeitlin, IPME, RAS, St. Petersburg, Russia ∗ †

Abstract

In this series of eight papers we present the applications of
methods from wavelet analysis to polynomial approxima-
tions for a number of accelerator physics problems. In this
part we consider orbital motion in transverse plane for a
single particle in a circular magnetic lattice in case when
we take into account multipolar expansion up to an arbi-
trary ﬁnite number. We reduce initial dynamical problem to
the ﬁnite number (equal to the number of n-poles) of stan-
dard algebraical problem and represent all dynamical vari-
ables via an expansion in the base of periodical wavelets.

1

INTRODUCTION

This is the second part of our eight presentations in which
we consider applications of methods from wavelet analy-
sis to nonlinear accelerator physics problems. This is a
continuation of our results from [1]-[8], which is based on
our approach to investigation of nonlinear problems – gen-
eral, with additional structures (Hamiltonian, symplectic or
quasicomplex), chaotic, quasiclassical, quantum, which are
considered in the framework of local (nonlinear) Fourier
analysis, or wavelet analysis. Wavelet analysis is a rela-
tively novel set of mathematical methods, which gives us a
possibility to work with well-localized bases in functional
spaces and with the general type of operators (differential,
integral, pseudodifferential) in such bases. In this part we
consider orbital motion in transverse plane for a single par-
ticle in a circular magnetic lattice in case when we take into
account multipolar expansion up to an arbitrary ﬁnite num-
ber. We reduce initial dynamical problem to the ﬁnite num-
ber (equal to the number of n-poles) of standard algebraical
problem and represent all dynamical variables as expansion
in the base of periodical wavelet functions. Our consider-
ation is based on generalization of variational wavelet ap-
proach from part 1. After introducing our starting points
related to multiresolution in section 3, we consider meth-
ods which allow us to construct wavelet representation for
solution in periodic case in section 4.

2 PARTICLE IN THE MULTIPOLAR

FIELD

The magnetic vector potential of a magnet with 2n poles in
Cartesian coordinates is

where fn is a homogeneous function of x and y of order n.
The real and imaginary parts of binomial expansion of

correspond to regular and skew multipoles. The cases
n = 2 to n = 5 correspond to low-order multipoles:
quadrupole, sextupole, octupole, decapole. Then we have
in particular case the following equations of motion for sin-
gle particle in a circular magnetic lattice in the transverse
plane (x, y) ([9] for designation):

Then we may take into account arbitrary but ﬁnite num-
ber in expansion of RHS of Hamiltonian (4) and from our
point of view the corresponding Hamiltonian equations of
motions are not more than nonlinear ordinary differential
equations with polynomial nonlinearities and variable co-
efﬁcients.

3 WAVELET FRAMEWORK

Our constructions are based on multiresolution approach.
Because afﬁne group of translation and dilations is inside
the approach, this method resembles the action of a mi-
croscope. We have contribution to ﬁnal result from each
scale of resolution from the whole inﬁnite scale of spaces.

More exactly, the closed subspace Vj(j
to level j of resolution, or to scale j. We consider a r-regular
multiresolution analysis (MRA) of L2(Rn) (of course, we
may consider any different functional space) which is a se-
quence of increasing closed subspaces Vj:

4 VARIATIONAL WAVELET APPROACH
FOR PERIODIC TRAJECTORIES

We start with extension of our approach from part 1 to
the case of periodic trajectories. The equations of motion
corresponding to Hamiltonian (4) may also be formulated
as a particular case of the general system of ordinary dif-
ferential equations dxi/dt = fi(xj, t), (i, j = 1, ..., n),
1, where fi are not more than polynomial func-

So, we reduced our last problem to standard linear alge-
braical problem. Then we use the same methods as in part
1. As a result we obtained for closed trajectories of orbital
dynamics described by Hamiltonian (4) the explicit time
solution (14) in the base of periodized wavelets (16).

rmannsfeldt (SLAC), Mrs. J. Kono (LBL) and M. Laraneta
(UCLA) for their permanent encouragement

also depend on particular type of wavelet construction and
type of bases. This linear problem is our second reduced

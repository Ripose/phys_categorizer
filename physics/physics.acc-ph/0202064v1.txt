Abstract. We investigate the inﬂuence of the spin-ﬂip transitions on formation
of the spectral distribution of the radiation emitted by ultra-relativistic of tens to
hundreds GeV electrons incident along crystallographic axis in a thin single crystal.
Both the formalism and the numerical data are presented. The calculated spectra for
35 to 243 GeV electrons in W crystal are compared with the dependences obtained
experimentally [1].

Introduction

The aim of this paper is to carry out quantitative analysis of the role of the spin-
ﬂip transitions in formation of the total emission spectra by ultra-relativistic electrons
which traverse single crystal close to its axial direction. This study was stimulated by a
recent paper [1] where the experimental data on radiative energy loss of ε = 35 to 243
GeV electrons incident on a W single crystal are presented and, to a great extent, are
interpreted as the ﬁrst experimental evidence of a signiﬁcant contribution of spin to the
radiative spectrum.

The photon emission by a highly relativistic particle in a static ﬁeld of crystalline
axis/plane and the magnetic bremsstrahlung (or synchrotron radiation) are examples
of the radiative processes occurring in strong ﬁelds. It is a well-established fact (e.g.

[2, 3]) that quantum eﬀects start manifesting themselves in the photon spectrum when a
dimensionless quantum parameter χ exceeds the value of
0.1. The quantum parameter
can be written as χ = γ H/H0 (for magnetic bremsstrahlung) or χ = γ E/E0 (for the
radiation process in the external electric ﬁeld), where γ = ε/mc2 is the relativistic factor
of projectile, H/E is the strength of the magnetic/electric ﬁeld and H0 = E0 = m2c3/e¯h
is the critical ﬁeld.

≈

In this paper we focus attention on the inﬂuence of the spin-related eﬀects on
the formation of the spectral distribution of unpolarized photons emitted by tens to
hundreds GeV electrons incident under small angle ϑ0 to crystallographic axes of a thin
single crystal.

Theoretical approaches suitable for the analysis of the inﬂuence of the spin-related
eﬀects on the radiative spectrum of ultra-relativistic particles in a strong external
ﬁeld include (a) the quasi-classical method based on the operator representation of
the projectile’s wave function [4, 5] (see also [6]), (b) the approach based on the
correspondence principle and utilizing the equivalent photon method [7] (see also [8]),
(c) the full quantum-electrodynamical treatment of a kinetic equation for an electron
moving in the ﬁeld of a crystal axis [9].

In section 2 we present general formulae which allow to estimate quantitatively the
contribution of the spin-ﬂip transitions to the total radiative spectrum. This part of the
paper, which is included to make the reading easier, contains all the essential expressions
which were used to carry out the numerical analysis. They represent the quasi-classical
formalism described in great detail in [5].

To say it very clearly: (a) All the formulae are from [5] except one (equation (9)
below) which could not be found there. This refers to the explicit expression for
(b) In application to the radiation emission
the diﬀerential intensity with spin-ﬂip.
in crystals the formulae contain the standard CFA (constant ﬁeld approximation) and
correction terms (for details see section 2). (c) When carrying out the numerical analysis
we used both methods, ’pure CFA’ and ’CFA + corrections’.

The numerical results are presented, discussed and compared with the experimental
data [1] in section 3. A summary of the results and possible directions for further
improvement of the theoretical model are given in section 4.

2. The formalism

Within the framework of the quasi-classical approach the spectral-angular distribution
of the energy radiated by an ultra-relativistic particle (of a spin s = 1/2) moving in an
external static ﬁeld is given by the following formulae

The notations used are as follows: α is the ﬁne structure constant, ω, k and e are,
respectively, the photon energy, wave vector and polarization vector, n = c k/ω denotes
the direction of the emission, c is the light velocity, dΩn is the solid angle associated
with n. The initial and ﬁnal energies of the projectile are denoted by ε and ε′ = ε
¯hω,
the quantities ~ξ and ~ξ′ stand for the polarization vectors of the initial and ﬁnal states
respectively, ~σ is the vector constructed from the Pauli matrices σj (j = x, y, z). The
quantity ω′ is deﬁned as ω′ = ω (ε/ε′)

−

The remarkable feature of the quasi-classical formulae (1-5) is that they combine
the classical description of the projectile’s dynamics and the speciﬁc quantum eﬀects.
Indeed, the integrand in (1) is time-dependent through the functions p(t) and r(t)
which represent the classically deﬁned momentum and the position vector of the
projectile moving in an external ﬁeld. Therefore the emitted radiation is described
in terms of the trajectory deﬁned by p(t) and r(t), as in classical electrodynamics; it is
uniquely parametrized by the initial energy ε and and the initial values p0 = p(0) and
r0 = r(0). On the other hand, these expressions account for two important types
of quantum corrections:
the change in the projectile
energy/momenta due to photon emission) which formally enters the integrand in (1)
through the ’corrected’ photon frequency ω′, and (b) the dependence of the intensity of
radiation on the spin quantum numbers of the projectile. The latter enter the formulae
through the two-component polarization density matrices (1 + ~ξ
~σ)/2
(see (2)).

~σ)/2 and (1 + ~ξ′

·

The quantum corrections related to the projectile’s dynamics in the external ﬁeld
are neglected. This is fully justiﬁed provided the particle can be considered as an
ultra-relativistic in both the initial and the ﬁnal states. Hence, it is implied that the
relativistic factors satisfy the strong inequalities γ = ε/mc2
1. If
these conditions are met then, as it is proved in [4, 5] (see also the recent paper [6]), the
expressions (1-5) can be used to evaluate the characteristics of radiation emitted by a
projectile moving in an arbitrary static ﬁeld.

Once the functions p(t) and r(t) are known, then the these formulae allow one
to evaluate the most detailed characteristics of the emitted radiation. These include

4

the dependence of dE not only on the photon energy and the emission angle but the
polarizational properties as well.
In particular, one can analyze the role of the spin
degree of freedom in the radiative process.

To obtain expressions describing the radiative spectra of a collimated bunch of
unpolarized electrons passing through a crystal close to the axial direction one has to
carry out the following transformation of the right-hand side of (1): (a) summation
over the photon polarizations, (b) averaging over the electron polarizations (the cases
ξ′ =
ξ have to be considered separately), (c) integration over the emission angles, and
(d) averaging over the fast oscillatory transverse motion of the electrons due to the action
of the axial ﬁeld. The transformations (a)-(c) are carried out using standard methods
(see, e.g., [2, 5]). An adequate approach for averaging over the transverse motion is based
on the statistical description of the particle distribution in the phase space ([5, 10]). In a
thin crystal, where one can neglect the inﬂuence of multiple scattering from the crystal
nuclei and electrons, the diﬀerential probability, dw, for a projectile with (transverse)
coordinate ~ρ and velocity v⊥ can be written as follows

dw (~ρ, v⊥) =

The quantity ε⊥0 stands for the transverse energy ε⊥ 0 = εϑ2
0/2 + U(ρ0) which, for given
ϑ0 and the entrance coordinate ρ0, is the constant of motion in a thin crystal. Note that
for the incident angles larger than the critical Lindhard-angle, ϑL = (2U0/ε)1/2 (where
U0 is the depth of the potential well), when ε⊥0 > U0, the right-hand side of (7) reduces
to unity.

For small incident angles ϑ0 one can use the continuous model for the potential of the
axis. Then, assuming this potential to be axially symmetric, solving (approximately)
the equation of motion ˙v(t) = ε−1 (dU(ρ)/d~ρ) using on the right-hand side the relation
r(t) = r0 + v0 t for the position vector (v0 is the the mean velocity of the particle), and,
ﬁnally, using the obtained expressions in eqs. (1)-(5), one ﬁnds that the functions Φ(τ )

¿From the computational viewpoint the direct calculation of the functions (11-12)
and, correspondingly, the spectra (9) is a non-trivial problem even if one utilizes simple
analytic forms for the axial potential such as the Moli´ere approximation or the Lindhard
potential [10]. Considerable simpliﬁcation of the formulae is achieved within a so-
called constant ﬁeld approximation (CFA) [5]. The latter implies that the change in
the particle’s radial distance, ∆ρ = v⊥τc = cϑ0τc, occurring during the time interval

τc = lc/c (here lc ∼
within which the axial ﬁeld changes noticeably. Hence, provided the condition lcϑ0 < as
is met, one can expand the integrands in (11-12) in powers of q0 τ

addition, the incident angle ϑ0 is small compared with ϑv, then the terms proportional
to (ϑ0/ϑv)2 can be treated as small corrections. Within this approximation the functions
(11-12) are expressed in terms of local characteristics of the trajectory. The ﬁnal result,

3. Numerical results

In this section we present the results of calculations of the spectral intensity of radiation
emitted by ultra-relativistic electrons in the energy range ε = 35
243 GeV incident with
ϑ0 = 0.3 mrad from (111) axis in a W crystal of a thickness 0.2 mm. The parameters
correspond to those used in a recent experiment [1] where the main emphasis was put
on the investigation of the role of the spin-ﬂip process in forming the total radiative
spectrum.

The calculation of the spectral intensity was based on the formulae (14-20). The
averaging over the projectile trajectories was carried out according to the rule (8) where
we used F (ρ, ϑ0) = 1 which is justiﬁed by the relation ϑ0 > ϑL. Indeed, for the potential
1000 eV and, therefore, the Lindhard
of a (111) axis the depth of the potential well is
critical angle ϑL = 0.09 . . . 0.2 mrad for ε = 35
243 GeV.

We used a continuous potential approximation for modelling the ﬁeld of an atomic
string. The potential of an individual atom was calculated by using the radial
wavefunctions within the non-relativistic Hartree-Fock approximation. For the distances
ρ = [0, ρs] (where ρs = Lc/√6 is the half-distance between two (111) axes, Lc = 3.165
˚A is the lattice constant of a W crystal [12]) the potential of the individual string was
corrected by accounting for the potentials created by the nearest six axes. Only axially-
symmetric part of the resulting ﬁeld was used. The dependence of the ﬁeld strength
dU(ρ)/dρ on the distance ρ from the axis are plotted in ﬁgure 2. The screening distances,
as, deﬁned as the root of the equation dU(as)/dρ = e−1 (dU/dρ)max, are equal to 0.125
˚A for the crystal temperature T = 70 K and to 0.191 ˚A for T = 293 K.

As functions of ρ the spectral intensities dE(t)/¯h dω dl depend strongly on the
magnitude of the local quantum parameter χ(ρ) deﬁned by eq.
(16). Namely, the
value of χ(ρ) deﬁnes the eﬀective range of the emitted photon energies. The formal
analysis of this statement is as follows. The right-hand side of (14) is expressed in
terms of the Airy function and its derivative. These functions satisfy the conditions

case the total spectral distribution dE(tot)/¯h dω dl is (roughly) ﬂat within the interval

comparable in magnitude with the total spectrum) at the hard end of the spectrum
whereas for ¯hω/ε
1 it is negligibly small. The latter result immediately follows if
one compares the coeﬃcients C (tot) and C (−) (see (10)): for µ

inequality is valid C (−)/C (tot)

the values of the quantum parameter χs (see (13)) are plotted as well. The maximum
distance ρs is deﬁned by the crystal symmetry and the chosen crystallographic direction
and is independent on the crystal temperature. For a (111) axis in a W crystal ρs = 1.292

the spin-ﬂip transitions. For ﬁxed temperature the values of ˜ρ1,2 do not depend on ε,
while the interval [˜ρ1, ˜ρ2] increases with T . Thus, the intervals of the radial distances

range ρ

contribution of the regions where χ(ρ) < 1. As a result, even for high energies of the
projectile electron the relative yield of soft photons is larger than that of ¯hω

The results of our calculations of the radiative spectra are presented in ﬁgures 4
(a-e). The energies of electrons as well as the incident geometry (as speciﬁed in the
caption) correspond to the experimental conditions [1]. In addition to the information
presented in the caption let us note the following. The averaging procedure was carried
out according to (8) where we used F (ρ, ϑ0) = 1 which is adequate for the over-barrier
motion in a thin crystal. Thus, we have disregarded the evolution of the distribution
function due to the eﬀects of multiple scattering and the radiation damping. All curves
in ﬁgures 4 (a-e) were obtained within the CFA, i.e. by using the ﬁrst two terms in
the curly brackets on the right-hand side of (14). The dependences represented by open
circles were calculated (at T = 293 K) using a more elaborated method. For the photon

proportional to ϑ2
v. To calculate the total radiative spectrum in the region of lower
photon energies we made use of the asymptotic expressions (17.11-12) from [5] which
are valid, within logarithmic accuracy, for χs ≫

For the sake of comparison in ﬁgure 4(f) we plotted the spectral distributions
calculated for a ε = 243 GeV electron and for the incident geometry as described
above but without averaging over the radial distances ρ. The curves corresponding to
T = 70 and 293 K were obtained by accounting for the ﬁrst two terms in (14) where the
constant values of the quantum parameter χ = χs (see ﬁgure 3) were used. It is exactly
this approximation which was used, as one understands, in [1] when interpreting the
experimental data.

First we discuss the diﬀerences between the averaged and non-averaged intensities.
There are three features which clearly distinguish the curves in ﬁgure 4 (f) from their
analogies in ﬁgure 4 (e). These are: (a) the absolute magnitude of the intensities, (b)
the shapes of the spectral distributions, and (c) the diﬀerences between the T = 70 K
and T = 243 K spectra.

Although striking, these diﬀerences can be easily understood. To illustrate this let
us analyze the behaviour of the intensities due to the spin-ﬂip transitions. The analysis
of the discrepancies in the total spectral distributions can be carried out using similar
arguments.

It is easily checked that for large values of χs the corresponding non-averaged
spectral intensity due to the spin-ﬂip transition attains its maximum at the photon
energies satisfying the condition u = µ/(1
χs. A quantitative estimate of the
intensity in the vicinity of the maximum reads

The right-hand sides of eqs. (21) and (22), reproducing with a reasonable accuracy
the maximum values of the spectral intensities due to the spin-ﬂip transition (the dotted
curves in ﬁgures 4 (e) and (f)), allows one to explain the discrepancies between the
averaged and non-averaged spectra. The excess of the non-averaged intensities over
the averaged ones is reproduced by the ratio χs/χef f which equals 44 at T = 70 K
and 31 at T = 293 K which are close to the exact values which follow from ﬁgures
4 (e) and (f): 57 and 43, respectively. The diﬀerent behaviour of the two types of
the spectral distributions also follows from the above written formulae.
Indeed, the
ratio χs (T = 70) /χs (T = 293) = 1.7 explains the diﬀerence between the thick and
1.1

illustrates that the averaged intensities are much less sensitive to the change in the

Similar features characterize the total spectral distributions obtained from (8) and
(14) including the correction terms proportional to ϑ2
0.16, - the open circles in

ﬁgures 4 (a-e). The contribution of the correction terms is negligibly small for ¯hω
when the coherence length is small enough so that the characteristics of the spectrum are
deﬁned by the instant value of the particle’s acceleration. Their inﬂuence becomes visible
in the low-energy part of the spectrum. As it is seen, the inclusion of the correction
terms decreases the magnitude of the spectrum for ¯hω
ε which leads to a further
ﬂattening of the distribution.

Commenting on the spectral intensities due to the spin-ﬂip transitions we note the
following. For all incident energies the spectra become pronounced close to the tip-
region. This feature, which is known for both the synchrotron radiation [2, 3, 4] and for
the radiation by electrons in the ﬁeld of crystals [1, 5, 7, 8], can be easily traced from
the general formulae (9-10). Indeed, the spin-ﬂip intensity is proportional to the factor

is not adequate to describe the radiative spectra in the crystal (see the discussion in
connection with ﬁgure 4), so that the thin solid curves are plotted for the illustrative
purposes only.

Thus, on the basis of these calculations we cannot conﬁrm in full the statement
made in [1] that the region µ
1 of the radiative spectrum by ultra-relativistic electrons
moving under a small incident angle with respect to the crystallographic axis is formed
mainly due to the spin-ﬂip transition of the projectile.

4. Concluding remarks

We have calculated the spectral distributions of radiation formed during the passage of
multi-GeV unpolarized electrons along (111) axis in W crystal. The consideration was
carried out within the framework of the quasi-classical approach [5] which adequately
describes the radiative process of ultra-relativistic particles in strong external ﬁelds.

Special attention was paid to the investigation of the contribution of the spin-ﬂip

17

≈

≈

transitions of the projectile to the total spectrum. The results of our study can be
summarized as follows. The role of the spin-ﬂip transitions in forming the hard-photon
ε, of the radiative spectrum is quite noticeable. Deﬁnitely, it is much
end, ¯hω
larger than that predicted in [9] where a full quantum-electrodynamical approach was
developed. However, we also can hardly agree with the statement made in [1] that it is
the spin-ﬂip transitions which do modify dramatically the shape of spectral distributions.
The numerical results presented in this paper agree well with the experimental data in
the range of photon energies ¯hω
(0.7 . . . 1.0)ε, i.e. exactly where the contribution of
the spin-ﬂip transitions becomes pronounced. This fact demonstrates the applicability
of the standard CFA model (combined with a proper procedure for averaging over the
phase volume of a projectile) for the description of the hard-end of the spectrum for over-
barrier particles. For lower photon energies, when the coherence length becomes larger
than the typical scale of variation of the potential of a crystallographic axis/plane, it is
necessary to go beyond the CFA scheme. In the present paper we utilized the approach
suggested in [5] which allows to incorporate the corrections proportional to (ϑ0/ϑv)2.
Our data shows that even when this parameter is small (in the case considered in this
paper (ϑ0/ϑv)2 = 0.16) the correction terms reduce noticeably the magnitude of the
spectral intensity in the range of small photon energies. This approach becomes less
adequate as ¯hω/ε
1. In this case one has to use the formulae (9-12) which include
the deviations from the CFA in the most general way.

≪

The theoretical results can be improved further by taking into account three
important eﬀects which are intrinsic for the radiative scattering of an ultra-relativistic
particle in the ﬁeld of a crystal. The ﬁrst one is the analogue of the Landau-
Pomeranchuk-Migdal eﬀect [13]. The latter consists in a strong suppression of the yield
of the soft-photon bremsstrahlung emitted by an ultra-relativistic particle in medium.
This is a result of a number of correlated small-angle collisions of the projectile with
the lattice atoms on the scale of the coherence length. Similar eﬀect occurs when
the particle moves close to an atomic string in a crystal and under the small angle
ϑ0 from the axis [14]. The account for this mechanism will reduce the magnitude of
the spectral intensity for low photon energies. Another phenomenon to be accounted
for is the cascade process of the photon emission which is eﬀectively generated when
a multi-GeV electron/positron enters the crystal at small (ϑ0 < ϑv) angles to the
crystallographic axis/plane [5, 15]. The third eﬀect we would like to mention is the
inﬂuence of the radiative loss on the shape of the emission spectrum. In the present
calculations we disregarded the change in the particle’s energy on the scale of the crystal
thickness L. However, as soon as L becomes comparable with the eﬀective radiation
length the formalism must include the solution of the proper kinetic equation ([5, 9]).
This consideration is fully appropriate in the case considered in the present paper with

thick W crystal. Comparing this length with the values of Lef f (see table 1) one ﬁnds
0.5, so that the electron looses half of its initial energy. Although it is
L/Lef f ≈
clear, qualitatively, how the radiative loss inﬂuences the radiative spectrum (the latter
is shifted towards the low-energy part), the rigorous quantitative treatment is to be
performed for each speciﬁc set of the parameters: the incident energy and the geometry,
and the type of the crystal.

·

Finally, let us mention the phenomenon which was left beyond the scope of this
paper and which, as far as we know, has not been studied neither theoretically nor
[3]) that the magnetic bremsstrahlung leads to
experimentally. It is well-known (e.g.
the radiative self-polarization of the electron. Formally, this is due to the fact that the
diﬀerential probability contains the term proportional to ~ξ
H (here H is the vector of
the external magnetic ﬁeld) which depends on the angle between ~ξ and H. A similar
eﬀect was studied in [16] in connection with the axial channeling of electrons/positrons.
If one takes into account the radiative loss (which is the case when χ > 1 and γ
1)
then there appears a strong interaction of the spin with the ﬁeld of radiation, Hr
[4]. This results in (a) a noticeable change of the typical time τ of the radiative self-
polarization, and (b) in radiative damping which leads to the decrease of
. Later these
phenomena were considered in connection with the planar channeling of ultra-relativistic
electrons/positrons in slightly bent crystals [17, 18, 19]. It was demonstrated that there
appear additional terms, due to the centrifugal force in the bent channel, which inﬂuence
the spin-precession, and, as a result, the time of the self-polarization. We note here that
the planar channeling is more preferable than the axial one if studying the eﬀect of
radiative self-polarization. The reason is that the terms proportional to ~ξH (H is the
eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld acting on the particle in the channel) are less inﬂuenced by the
averaging over the phase distribution in the planar case.

~ξ

In our mind it will be very interesting to carry out the analysis (theoretically and,
if feasible, experimentally as well) of the self-polarization of a bunch of ultra-relativistic
particles undergoing channeling in a crystal whose channels are periodically bent. In
this case there arises very intensive radiation, additional to the well-known channeling
radiation, due to the periodicity of the trajectory of the projectile [20].

Abstract. We investigate, both analytically and numerically, the inﬂuence of the
dechanneling process on the parameters of undulator radiation generated by ultra-
relativistic positron channelling along a crystal plane, which is periodically bent. The
bending might be due either to the propagation of a transverse acoustic wave through
the crystal, or due to the static strain as it occurs in superlattices. In either case the
periodically bent crystal serves as an undulator which allows to generate X-ray and
γ-radiation.

We propose the scheme for accurate quantitative treatment of the radiation in
presence of the dechanneling. The scheme includes (i) the analytic expression for
spectral-angular distribution which contains, as a parameter, the dechanneling length,
(ii) the simulation procedure of the dechanneling process of a positron in periodically
bent crystals. Using these we calculate the dechanneling lengths of 5 GeV positrons
channeling in Si, Ge and W crystals, and the spectral-angular and spectral distributions
of the undulator over broad ranges of the photons. The calculations are performed for
various parameters of the channel bending.

Introduction

In this paper we proceed with the investigation of the properties of the spectrum of
emitted photons accompanying ultra-relativistic positron planar channeling through a
crystal which is periodically bent, as it is illustrated in ﬁgure 1. This phenomenon was
described recently in [1, 2] and was called Acoustically Induced Radiation (AIR). It
was noted that the periodic pattern of crystal bendings (which can be achieved either
through propagation of a transverse acoustic wave or by using static periodically strained
crystalline structures [2, 3]) gives rise to a new mechanism of electromagnetic emission
of the undulator type, in addition to a well-known ordinary channelling radiation [4, 5].
The mechanism of the AIR is as follows. Provided certain conditions are fulﬁlled [2] the
beam of particles, which enters the crystal at a small incident angle with respect to the
curved crystallographic plane, penetrates through the crystal following the bendings of
its channel. This results in transverse oscillations of the beam particles (additional to
the oscillations inside the channel due to the action of the interplanar force). These
oscillations become an eﬀective source of spontaneous radiation of undulator type
due to the constructive interference of the photons emitted from similar parts of the
trajectory. It was demonstrated [2] that the system “ultra-relativistic charged particle
+ periodically bent crystal” serves as a new type of undulator, and, consequently, as a
new source of undulator radiation of high intensity, monochromaticity and of a particular
pattern of the angular-frequency distribution.

The main subject of the present study is the detailed and accurate quantitative
consideration of the inﬂuence of the dechanneling process [6] on the parameters of the
AIR which are the intensity and the speciﬁc pattern of the spectral-angular and spectral
distributions. The dechanneling, i.e. the decrease in the volume density of the channeled
particles n(z) with penetration distance z due to the multiple scattering of the projectiles
with the target electrons and nuclei, is the parasitic eﬀect which leads to the restriction
on the crystal length L and, correspondingly, on the number of the undulator periods
N, which, in turn, deﬁnes the intensity of the AIR radiation [2]. The factor, which
plays a crucial role in obtaining the accurate data for the AIR characteristics, is a
so-called dechanneling length Ld, which is a mean penetration distance covered by a
channeling particle. The quantity Ld depends on the projectile energy, the type of the
crystal and crystallographic plane, and on the parameters of the channel bending (these
In this connection the following
are explained in more detail below in this section).
problems are solved and discussed below in the paper:

(i) We propose the scheme for accurate quantitative treatment of the AIR in presence
of the dechanneling (section 3). As a result, we evaluate simple analytic expression
for spectral-angular distribution of the AIR which contains, as a parameter, the
dechanneling length.

(ii) We introduce the algorithm of the simulation procedure of the dechanneling process

of a positron in periodically bent crystals (section 4).

(iii) Using (ii) we calculate the dechanneling lengths of 5 GeV positrons channeling in
Si, Ge and W crystals the (110) plane of which are periodically bent (section 5).
The calculations are performed for various parameters of the channel bending.
(iv) Using (i) and (iii) we calculate the spectral-angular and spectral distributions of
the AIR over broad ranges of the photons emitted by 5 GeV positrons channeled
in Si and W (section 6).

≪

In our previous papers [2] (see also [7, 8]) we have estimated the role of the
dechanneling by assuming simple relation L < Ld to be valid. The magnitude of
Ld was estimated on the basis of the diﬀusion theory (see [9, 10, 11, 12]) with some
corrections introduced due to the bending of the crystal [12, 13]. On the basis of these
estimates we carried out the calculations of the AIR spectra for various energies of
the projectile, diﬀerent types of the crystals and crystallographic plane and for various
parameters of the channel bending (these are explained in more detail below). It was also
pointed out [2] that the system “ultra-relativistic charged particles + periodically bent
crystal” leads, in addition to the spontaneous radiation, to the possibility of generating
stimulated emission, similar to the one known for a free-electron laser [14] in which the
periodicity of a trajectory of an ultra-relativistic projectile is achieved by applying a

4

spatially periodic magnetic ﬁeld. In connection with the stimulated AIR it was noted
in [2] that to achieve a noticeable degree of ampliﬁcation one has to operate with a
positron bunch of a high volume density. The dechanneling length played a crucial role
in these estimations by inﬂuencing the intensity of the spontaneous AIR as well as the
gain factor and the corresponding value of the positron bunch volume density for the
stimulated AIR. Indeed, increasing of the dechanneling length by a factor of 2 results
in decreasing of the channeling beam density needed to achieve large gain almost by by
a factor of 10 [2].

By utilizing the numeric scheme outlined in section 4 (to our knowledge it is the
ﬁrst time that the dechanneling process is simulated in a periodically bent crystal) we
demonstrate further in section 5 that the simple estimation of Ld made in [2] in many
cases produces the results which are noticeably smaller then more accurate ones. This
results, consequently, in essential (up to the order of magnitude for heavy crystals)
diﬀerence in the intensities of the AIR radiation (section 6) computed by using the
estimated, Le

Prior to presenting our main results let us formulate the important criteria which

are used further in the paper.

The planar channeling of an ultra-relativistic projectile in a straight crystal (for
reviews see [15, 16, 17]) occurs only if the entrance angle of the projectile velocity with
respect to the mid-plane does not exceed the critical angle of channeling [6]

Θ < ΘL

(1)

where the quantity ΘL (often called as the Lindhard angle) is deﬁned as (2Umax/mγ).
Here Umax is the interplanar potential-well depth, γ is the relativistic factor of the
projectile and m is its mass (below we consider only the channeling of positrons, if
otherwise is not explicitly stated).

The criterion for a stable channeling of an ultra-relativistic particle in a bent crystal
was formulated in [18] and has clear physical meaning: the maximum centrifugal force
due to the channel bending must be less than that of the interplanar ﬁeld. Provided
this condition is fulﬁlled, the beam of channeling particles at each instant moves inside
the channel, especially parallel to the bent crystal midplane as it does in the case
of linear channeling. The dynamics of the particles channeled in crystals bent with a
constant (or slowly varied) curvature 1/R is described in details in [12, 13, 19, 20, 21, 22]
(see also the references therein).
In the cited reviews the main accent was made on
channeling of heavy projectiles due to the growing interest for using bent crystals for
extraction, bending and splitting of high-energy beams (for the latest review see [22]
and the references therein.

For a periodically bent crystal the criterion for a stable channeling can be written

in the form [2]

The channeling radiation [4, 5] formed by ultra-relativistic positrons channeled
in various straight crystals has been studied extensively both theoretically (e.g.
[17, 16, 23, 24] and references therein) and experimentally [25, 26, 27, 28, 29].

Several papers [30, 31, 21] have treated the radiation emitted by light projectiles
channeled in non-periodically one-arc bent crystals. In this case the channel bending
gives rise to the synchrotron-type radiation in addition to the channeling one. In the
cited papers it was demonstrated that for small values of the parameter C (i.e.
for
large curvatures of the bending) the photon energies corresponding to the maximum
intensity of the synchrotron radiation do not exceed the energy of the ﬁrst harmonic of
the channeling radiation.

≪

In the case a/d

When the shape of the bent channel becomes periodic the additional radiation
becomes of the undulator type [32, 16, 24, 33] rather than the synchrotron one. Then,
there appear two essentially diﬀerent regimes which are deﬁned by the magnitude of
the ratio a/d [2, 8].
1, which can be realized either by applying
low-amplitude transverse ultrasonic wave [34, 35, 36, 37, 38] or by using a supperlattice
crystalline structure [35], the characteristic frequencies of the two types of radiation can
become compatible, and thus, one can consider, at least theoretically, the phenomenon of
the resonant enhancement of the photon yield due to the coupling of these mechanisms.
However, as it was demonstrated in [2, 7, 8], in the limit a/d
1 the intensity of AIR is
noticeably small compared not only with that of the channeling radiation but also with
the intensities of the radiative background mechanisms, such as coherent and incoherent
bremsstrahlung. Hence, it is highly questionable whether the AIR can be considered as
a new phenomenon in the limit of low values of a.

On the contrary, if the amplitude of the shape function and the interplanar spacing

satisfy strong inequality

then (i) the characteristic frequencies of the AIR and the channeling radiation are well-
separated (this is the consequence of both conditions, (3) and C
1), (ii) the intensity

of the AIR is essentially higher that that of the ordinary channeling radiation [2, 7, 8].
In this case the undulator-type radiation due to the periodic structure of the crystal
bending can be considered as a new source of the emission within the X- and γ-range.
Below in the paper we assume that both strong inequalities (2) and (3) are fulﬁlled.
It is important to mention that in our scheme the amplitude a is subject not only to
λ.
the condition (3) but also is much smaller compared with the period of S(z): a
Hence, neither the interplanar spacing nor the distance between neighbouring lattice
atoms are changed (in more detail it is discussed in section 4.1).

≪

To conclude the introductory part we note that two realistic ways of “preparation” of
a periodically bent channel may be discussed [1, 2]. It is feasible, by means of modern
technology, to grow the crystal with its channels been statically bent according to a
particular pattern. In particular, the crystalline undulator can be constructed based
on graded composition strained layers in a superlattice [3] (see also [39, 40]). Another
possibility is to use high-amplitude transverse ultrasonic wave. In the latter case the
parameters of the undulator can be easily tuned by varying the amplitude and the
frequency of the acoustic wave.
It was demonstrated [2] that the acoustically-based
undulator can be created by applying the supersonic waves within the frequency range
10 . . . 100 MHz which is achievable in the experiments on propagating the positron beams
through acoustically-excited crystals [41].

2. The AIR radiation in absence of the dechanneling

Let us consider the spectral-angular distribution of the photons emitted during the
projectile positron planar channeling in a periodically bent crystal along the z direction
(see ﬁgure 1). The motion of the particle occurs in the (yz)-plane, so that its radius
vector and the velocity are given by r(t) = z ez + y ey, v(t) = ˙z ez + ˙y ey where ez and
ey are the unit vectors along the z- and y-directions, respectively.

Provided the conditions (1-3) are fulﬁlled the photon spectrum is formed due to
the ordinary channeling mechanism and to the AIR, which prevail over two other
radiative background mechanisms, coherent and incoherent bremsstrahlung.
It has
[16, 26, 28]), that the
been established, both theoretically and experimentally (e.g.
total radiative losses of a positron channeling in a straight crystal are essentially smaller
than its energy provided ε
20 GeV. This estimate is correct in the case of
channeling through periodically bent crystal as well [7].

Therefore, restricting from above the range of ε by the value

10GeV , one can
assume that the emitted photon energies satisfy ¯hω
ε. This inequality allows
to consider the process of the photon emission within the framework of classical
electrodynamics (e.g. [42]).

The last relation deﬁnes the so-called undulator parameter p, which is commonly used
in the theory of the undulator radiation (e.g. [16]). This quantity is related to the mean-
square velocity ˙y2 in the y-direction, which is transverse with respect to the centerline
of the bent channel (see ﬁgure 1).

If one neglects the processes of inelastic scattering by the crystal electrons and
nuclei, then the motion of the positron in the channeling regime can be described within
the framework of the continuum approximation [6, 15] for the interaction potential U
between the projectile and lattice atoms. Within this approximation and in the case
of periodically bent channel the dependence y(t), which enters the r.h.s. of (7-9) and,
thus, deﬁnes the spectral-angular distribution (6), can be obtained as follows [7, 8].

At any given moment t the y-coordinate of the projectile can be presented as a sum

of two terms

y(t) = S(z) + ρ(t)

(11)

8

Here S(z) is the displacement due to the channel bending. The quantity ρ(t) stands for
the displacement of the projectile from the centerline of the channel. The equation of
motion for ρ(t) reads [43]

¨ρ =

U ′
mγ −

−

c2 S′′

where the dot sign stands for the time derivative, U ′ = dU/dρ is the derivative of the
interplanar potential which depends on ρ, and S′′ = d2S/dz2. The ﬁrst term on the
r.h.s. represents the acceleration of the particle due to the action of the interplanar
force, while the second one is the acceleration due to the centrifugal force. Note that
on the r.h.s. one may put z = ct after carrying out the diﬀerentiation S′′, because all
the deviations from c of the particle’s velocity along the z-axis were taken into account
when writing eqs. (7-9).

Solving the equation of motion (12) and, then, using the result, combined with
(11), in (7-9), one obtains the total spectral-angular distribution of the radiation (6).
This scheme was used in our recent papers [8] where the results of the numerical
calculations of the spectra were presented for various shapes S(z) and with using
diﬀerent approximations for the interplanar potential U(ρ).

A particle which channels through periodically bent crystal experiences two types
of oscillations in the transverse direction, as it is seen from (11). Firstly, there are the
channeling oscillations due to the action of the interplanar potential. The oscillations
of the second type (henceforth we refer to them as to the “undulator oscillations”) are
related to the periodicity in the shape S(z) of the centerline of the channel inside which
the particle moves. The characteristic frequencies of these oscillations, denoted as Ωch
and Ωu respectively, can be estimated as follows

Correspondingly, the quantities Ωch, Ωu deﬁne the characteristic frequencies, ωch and
ωu, of the photons emitted due to the channeling and the undulator oscillations:

Ωch ∼ s

Hence, the characteristic frequencies of the AIR and the ordinary channelling radiation
are well separated [7], and, what is also very important, in the region ω
ωu there is
no coupling of the two mechanisms of the radiation [8].

The results of numerical calculation of the spectral distribution (6) presented in [8]
clearly suggest that the characteristics of the AIR spectra (the position of the peaks
of the radiation, their width, the radiated intensity) are, practically, insensitive to the
choice of the approximation used to describe the interplanar potential U(ρ). Moreover,
if being interested in the spectral-angular distribution only in the region ω
ωu, then
one may disregard the channeling oscillations and to assume that the projectile moves
along the centerline of the bent channel. In this case, taking into account the periodicity
of the undulator motion, the r.h.s. of (6) can be presented in the form which clearly
exhibits all the characteristic features of the AIR radiation.

Let assume that there is integer number of the undulator periods on the crystal
length, L = λ N. Also, for the sake of transparency of the analytic expressions, let
consider the shape function S(z) of the form

S(z) = a sin kz,

k = 2π/λ

Let assume that there is integer number of the undulator periods on the crystal

The information on the speciﬁc pattern of the undulator radiation, namely on the

This function, which is well-known in the theory of undulator radiation (see e.g. [16, 24])
and in classical diﬀraction theory [42], deﬁnes the proﬁle of the line of the emission in an
ideal undulator. It has sharp maxima at the points η = k = 1, 2, 3... where DN (k) = N 2.
The integer values η = k deﬁne (see the ﬁrst equation in (19)) the characteristic
frequencies ωk (harmonics) of the undulator radiation for which the spectral-angular

10

distribution (17) reaches its maxima:

ωk =

4γ2 ω0 k
2 + 2 γ2ϑ2 + p2

(21)

The natural width of each line of the emission can be estimated as ∆ω′ = (1/N)(ωk/k)
and is independent on the harmonic number k.

The largest number of the radiated harmonics, kmax, can be estimated as kmax ∼
≤

p3/2
(see e.g. [16, 24]), so that in the range ω
ωkmax the spectral-angular distribution of the
AIR represents by itself the set of narrow well-separated peaks. The radiation intensity
at ω = ωk is proportional to the square of the total number of the undulator periods,
N 2, reﬂecting the coherence eﬀect of radiation.

It follows from (21) that the position of the peaks are dependent on the relativistic

factor, on the emission angle ϑ, and on the undulator parameter p.

The only feature, related to the channeling oscillations, which modiﬁes the formulae
(17-21), which describe the AIR spectrum, concerns the deﬁnition of the undulator
parameter p (see (10)).

When the channeling oscillations are disregarded completely (this means omitting
the term ρ(t) on the r.h.s. of (11)) then the undulator parameter equals 2γ2S′ 2 =
4π2γ2a2/λ2, and for given γ is deﬁned only by the amplitude and the period of the
shape function S(z).

To account for the channeling oscillations and to modify the deﬁnition of p one can
use the following arguments. The quantity p2 is proportional to the the mean-square
velocity ˙y2. The latter, according to (11), can be written as follows:

˙y2 = c2 S′ 2 + ˙ρ2 + 2c S′ ˙ρ

The last term on the r.h.s.
contains the product of the factors oscillating with
incompatible frequencies (see (15), and, therefore, it disappears when one carries out the
1/Ωch. Hence, the square of the undulator parameter
averaging over the time interval
can be written as follows

integration of the equation of motion (12) with the interplanar potential considered

(6), and (iii) by further averaging of the result over all channeling trajectories, can be
accurately reproduced by using (19) and (22) with the term ˙ρ2 calculated within the
harmonic approximation for U(ρ). The use of (19) instead of (6) simpliﬁes the numerical
procedures considerably, leading to the reduction, by orders of magnitude, of the CPU
time.

3. The AIR radiation in presence of the dechanneling

If the dechanneling is neglected, one may unrestrictedly increase the intensity of the AIR
by considering larger N-values. In reality, random scattering of the channeling positron
by the electrons and nuclei of the crystal leads to a gradual increase of the particle energy
associated with the transverse oscillations in the channel. As a result, the transverse
energy at some distance from the entrance point exceeds the depth of the interplanar
potential well, and the particle leaves the channel. Consequently, the volume density
n(z) of the channeled particles decreases with the penetration distance z. Although the
exact explicit dependence of the channeled fraction of the particles n(z)/n0 on z (n0 is
the volume density of the channeled particles at the entrance) hardly can be obtained
by analytical means due to the complexity of the accurate treatment of the multiple
scattering problem in medium, it has been argued [12, 17] that far from the entrance
point n(z)/n0 can be described by the exponential decay law

Basing on this relation, below in this section we present a model which allows to
modify the spectral-angular distribution (17) by taking into account the inﬂuence of
the dechanneling eﬀect.

Let us assume that the period λ of the shape function S(z) and the dechanneling
Ld. If so, then the number of particles (per
length Ld satisfy the strong inequality λ
unit volume) ∆n = n(z)
n(z+λ), which dechannel within the interval [z, z+λ], is small
compared with the number of the particles n(z) which reach the point z. The inequality
allows also to introduce the (discrete) probability pj of the event, that after channeling
through j periods of the undulator (j = 1, 2, . . . N
1) the particle dechannels within
the subsequent (j + 1)-th period. In accordance with (23) the probability pj is written
as follows

Let us note here the diﬀerence between the averaging procedure suggested above by
relation (25) and the conventional scheme (see e.g. [16]) for obtaining the characteristics
of the electromagnetic radiation accompanying the motion of an ultra-relativistic particle
in medium. The latter approach prescribes that, in the presence of multiple scattering,
the radiative spectrum (4) formed during the motion of a projectile in an external
ﬁeld along some particular trajectory must be averaged over all allowed trajectories.
This operation is carried out with the help of the distribution function satisfying the
corresponding kinetic equation [16]. Although the AIR radiation in medium is not an
exclusion from this rule, in this case there is one peculiarity which justiﬁes the use of
the averaging procedure (25). As mentioned above, the motion of a positron channelled
through a periodically bent crystal is characterized by two essentially diﬀerent modes.
The “fast” mode corresponds to the channeling oscillations inside the channel, the “slow”
mode describes the motion of the particle along the channel centerline. The AIR is due
to the “slow” mode and in the case a
d its characteristics are almost independent on
the parameters of the fast channeling oscillations [2, 8]. Hence, if one is interested in the
spectral-angular distribution of the AIR only, then it is suﬃcient to totally disregard the
channeling oscillations and to assume that the particle moves along the ﬁxed trajectory
which is deﬁned by the proﬁle of the bent channel centerline. The intensity of the AIR
radiation is then deﬁned by the number n of the λ-periods which the particle passes
before leaving the channel due to the multiple scattering. The value of n is subject to
the probability distribution (24) which, in turn, is based on the exponential decay law
(23).

≫

Hence, to obtain the parameters of the AIR radiation in presence of the dechanneling
it is suﬃcient to substitute the factor DN (η) (see (20)) with its averaged value deﬁned
in (27). The sum on the r.h.s. of (27) is carried out straightforwardly resulting in the

periods N can be varied by changing the length of the crystal L or/and by changing the
period λ of the shape function S(z) (see ﬁgure 1)).

In the case of a straight channel the dechanneling length Ld depends on the type of a
crystal and on the energy of projectile [15, 17]. For a crystal bent with constant curvature
1/R the quantity Ld becomes also dependent on R. The methods for estimating Ld for
heavy projectiles channeling in crystals bent with 1/R = const are discussed in [12].
To our knowledge, no detailed study has been carried out of the dependence of the
dechanneling length on the parameters of the shape function S(z) in the case of a light

sections we present the approach and the results of numerical calculation of Ld in this
case.

4. Simulation of the dechanneling process in periodically bent crystals

As it was demonstrated above the intensity of the radiation and the proﬁle of the line
of the AIR are deﬁned, to a great extent, by the parameter Ld.

This section is devoted to the description of the model which we used to calculate the
dechanneling length Ld for an ultra-relativistic positron channeling through periodically
bent crystal. Our approach is based on the simulation of the trajectories and the
dechanneling process of an ultra-relativistic positron. This is done by solving the three-
dimensional equations of motion which account for (i) the interplanar potential, (ii) the
centrifugal potential due to the crystal bending, (iii) the radiative damping force, (iv)
the stochastic force due to the random scattering of projectile by lattice electrons and
nuclei.

We analyze the dependence of Ld on the energy of the projectile, the type of the
crystal and crystallographic plane, the parameters of the shape function S(z). The
latter include two factors: the parameter C and the ratio a/d (see eqs. (2-3)).

The results of our calculations of the quantity Ld, presented in section 5, are used
further in section 6 to calculate the spectral-angular and the spectral distributions of
the AIR.

4.1. Equations of motion in periodically bent crystal with account for the radiation
damping

Below we outline the derivation of the equations of motion for an ultra-relativistic
positron channeled in a periodically bent crystal. Contrary to the case of a heavy
projectile, a light projectile (a positron, an electron) with ε
1600 m/Z looses its

Here the subscript 0 refers to the straight channel. When combined, the relations (34)
lead to the conclusion that the parameters of the bent channel, which are the channel
width and the distance between the atoms of any crystallographic plane, are equal to
the their values in the case of straight crystal provided one neglects the terms of the
order ξ2 and higher. This, in turn, allows to formulate the following two conditions

out the terms of the order U/mγc2. This is justiﬁed by the fact that for most of crystals

4.2. Equations of motion with account for the random collisions with target electrons
and nuclei

Random scattering of a projectile by target electrons and nuclei leads to deviation
of the trajectory from that which is obtained by solving equations of motion (37-39).
There are two diﬀerent approaches aimed to account for these deviations. The ﬁrst
approach is based on the diﬀusion theory applied to describe the multiple scattering
(e.g.
[11, 17, 48, 49]. The second approach is in direct computer simulation of the
scattering process [50, 12]. In the present paper we adopt the scheme similar to the one
described by Biryukov [50, 12].

Scattering from target electrons results in two changes in the projectile motion. The
ﬁrst one is the gradual decrease in the projectile energy due to the ionization losses.
The second eﬀect of the collisions is that they lead to a chaotic (random) change in the
direction of the projectile motion.

The scattering from target nuclei results in a chaotic (random) change in the

direction of the projectile motion.

Following Biryukov [50] we used the distribution (43) to generate (randomly) the
magnitude of θ when integrating the system of equations (37-38) and (42). The
magnitude of the second (the azimuthal) scattering angle φ is not restricted by any
kinematic relations, and is obtained by random shooting (with a uniform distribution)

5. Numerical results of the dechanneling process simulations

21

(51)

(52)

We used the scheme outlined in sections 4.1 and 4.2 for computer modelling of
the dechanneling process of ultra-relativistic positrons in periodically bent crystals.
The goal of these calculations was to obtain realistic dependences of the number of
channeled particles n(z) versus the penetration distance z. The interplanar potential
was considered within the the Moli`ere approximation at the temperature T = 150 K.

The calculations were performed for 5 GeV positrons channelling along the (110)
crystallographic planes in Si, Ge, and W crystals. The shape function S(z) was chosen
in the form (16). In this case the minimum curvature radius of the centerline bending
equals Rmin = 1/(ak2) = λ2/4π2a, and, consequently, the parameter C deﬁned in (2)
reads as C = εak2/U ′
max. Thus, for given crystal and crystallographic plane, and for
given ε the parameter C and the ratio a/d uniquely deﬁne the period λ.

In our calculations C was varied from 0 to 0.5, and the considered ratios a/d are: 0

(the case of a straight channel), 5,10, 15 and 20.

For each pair of the parameters C and a/d we simulated 2000 trajectories by solving
the coupled system (37-38) and (42), which was integrated with the account for the
random scattering from target electrons and nuclei as explained in section 4.2. The
initial conditions were chosen as follows. The coordinates x and z were set to zero
at the entrance, the transverse coordinate ρ was obtained by random shooting (with
d/2, d/2]. The vector of initial velocity v0

was aligned with the tangent to the centerline at the entrance but with allowance for
Θmax, Θmax]. Hence, the initial values of the
the spread in the incident angles Θ
velocities ˙x/c and ˙ρ/c were obtained by random shooting (with a uniform distribution)
Θmax, Θmax]. For each crystal the parameter Θmax was chosen as

is achievable in modern high-energy e+ e− colliders (see e.g. [56]).

The ratio a/d equals 10. The curves in the ﬁgures refer to diﬀerent values of C

the steep change in the magnitude in the region close to z = 0. This change, ∆n0,
is the smallest for the straight channels and its magnitude increases with C. Such a
behaviour is explained as follows. The probability for the projectile to undergo the large-
angle scattering from the crystal electrons or/and nuclei is proportional to the volume
densities nel(ρ) and nn(ρ) (see (46-50)). The large-angle scattering, i.e. when θ > ΘL,
results in the increase of the kinetic transverse energy, which becomes high enough for
the projectile positron to leave the potential well. Hence, all those particles which at the
entrance move in the region of high nuclear and electron densities leave the channeling
mode almost immediately. The volume density of crystal electrons is comparatively
aTF (here
small in the inner region of the channel and sharply increases as
aTF = 0.8853Z −1/3a0 is the Thomas-Fermi radius of the crystal atoms, a0 is the Bohr
uT (uT standing
radius), the density of target nuclei becomes noticeable for
for the thermal vibration root-mean-square amplitude). This is illustrated by ﬁgure
7. Since in our simulations we assumed that the particles are uniformly distributed in
the coordinate ρ at the entrance point, then the fraction
2 aTF)/d leaves
the channel close to z = 0. This the mechanism of dechanneling in the vicinity of the
entrance point [12] is intrinsic for both straight (C = 0) and bent (C > 0) channels.
In addition to it, in the case of bent channel there is a process which is called bending

the channelling mode provided its total energy associated with the transverse motion is
less the minimal value, Uef f (ρmin), of the two maxima points of the asymmetric potential
well described by (53) [7, 12]. The potential Uef f (ρ) reaches the magnitude of Uef f (ρmin)
at some point ρmin which satisﬁes the condition
< d/2 and the absolute value of
ρmin decreases with the growth of a. Hence, the more the channel is bent, the lower
the allowed values of the channelling oscillations amplitude are, and, consequently, the
narrower is the interval of the initial ρ0 values for which the trajectory from the very
beginning will correspond to the channeling one.

Another feature to be mentioned in connection with the curves in ﬁgures 4-6 is
the noticeable decrease, with the growth of C, of the penetration distance which the
projectile can achieve. If one assumes that the dependence n(z) satisﬁes the exponential-

in connection with the heavy particles dechanneling in crystals bent with constant
curvature. Physically clear quantitative arguments [12], based on the relationship
between the diﬀusion coeﬃcient and the mean-square angle of multiple scattering lead

In periodically bent crystal the mean curvature radius is proportional to Rmin (in

was used in [2, 7, 8] to calculate the characteristics of the spontaneous and stimulated
emissions based on the AIR eﬀect.

Basing on the estimate (54) one deduces that the dechanneling length is mainly
determined by the value of the parameter C and is not inﬂuenced by the a/d ratio. This
conclusion is supported by the results of our calculations. In ﬁgure (8) the dependences
n(z)/n(0), obtained for diﬀerent C and a/d values, are compared. It is seen that the
variations between the curves with diﬀerent a/d but the same C is much smaller than
for the curves with the same a/d ratio but diﬀerent C values.

Comparing the calculated values Lc

d with those estimated from (54) one notices that
the latter underestimates the dechanneling length in the case of small values of the
parameter C: C < 0.25 for Si, < 0.20 for Ge, and < 0.15 for W. It happens mainly
due to the fact that the quantity Le
), which enters (54), was obtained by using the
d(
Lindhard approximation for the interplanar potential U(ρ). The latter overestimates
the electron density inside the channel as compared with the Moli`ere approximation
used in the present calculations. Thus, the average multiple scattering angle is higher
if calculated within the Lindhard approximation, and, consequently, the dechanneling
lengths are lower. With C increasing the ratio Lc
d becomes less than one. This is
explained as follows. When the parameter C, and, consequently, the curvature of the
channel bending, increases, then the minimum of the eﬀective potential (53) is shifted
from the midplane towards the atomic plane. Hence, the channeled particle moves in
the region of higher electron density and, therefore, the probability of the large-angle
scattering increases [12, 13]. This is mechanism of the dechanneling, which is additional
to the bending dechanneling discussed above, is not accounted for by the estimate (54).
Comparing the Lc
d values for various C it is seen that for large C the dechanneling length
rapidly goes to zero, and the main reason for this behaviour is the increase of the role
of the large-angle scattering.

d/Le

Another important feature to be mentioned is that the estimate (54) predicts the
decrease in the dechanneling length for heavier crystals, whereas the more accurate
calculations within the framework of the Moli`ere approximation demonstrate that for
[0 . . . 0.1] the largest dechanneling lengths are in W, followed by the germanium
C
crystal, and ﬁnally, the lowest values of Lc
d are in the case of channeling in Si. With
C increasing the situations is reversed. To explain this behaviour let us compare the
cases of Si and W crystals. The maximum values of the interplanar potential U(ρ) at
temperature T = 150 K are equal to 22.9 eV for Si, and to 138.6 eV for W. Thus, the
critical transverse energy of the channeled positrons is approximately 6 times higher in
W. Hence, were the mean electron densities in these crystal equal then the dechanneling
length in W would be 6 times higher as compared to the silicon case. The ratio of

the mean electron densities for the inner regions of the (110) channels in W and Si
is approximately 3.8. Therefore, the realistic estimate for the ratio (Ld)W / (Ld)Si is
1.6 which is very close to that which can be obtained from table 1 for low
6/3.8
C-values. Our results for the relative magnitudes of Ld for a positron channeling in
Si and W coincides with the conclusion of made in [59] where the calculations of the
dechanneling lengths were carried out for heavy particles in the case of moderate bending
of the crystals.

As C increases, and the trajectory of the particle shifts towards the atomic plane,
the electron density in the region of the projectile motion increases as well. This increase
is more pronounced for W (see ﬁgure (7)) leading to the relation (Ld)W / (Ld)Si < 1 in
the range C > 0.15.

The important conclusion which can be made on the basis of the results presented in
this section is the following. To achieve higher yield of the monochromatic radiation by
means of the crystalline undulator it is necessary to use heavier crystals and to restrict
the parameter C by the range 0.05 . . . 0.15. Indeed, for these C values the number of
the undulator periods N
1 (this is valid for all crystals presented in the table),
but the intensity of the AIR, which is mainly deﬁned by the factor N 2
d (see (26)
and (30)), will be almost by the order of magnitude lager in the case of W than for Si
and/or Ge crystals.

6. Results of calculations of the spectral-angular and spectral
distributions of the AIR

The simulation of the dechanneling process, described in the preceding section, allows
to establish the ranges of the parameter Nd which to a great extent deﬁnes the
characteristics of the AIR radiation in the presence of the dechanneling. In this section
(26)) and the
we present the results of calculations of the spectral-angular (see eq.
spectral distributions of the AIR.

The general features of the angular distribution of the radiation formed in an
acoustically based undulator were discussed in [2] where the eﬀect of the dechanneling
was taken into account by restricting the length of the crystal (and, hence, the number
of the undulator periods) by the value Le
d, which, as it was demonstrated above, in
many cases underestimates the dechanneling length, and, consequently, leads to the
underestimation of the photon yield.

Figures 9(a)–9(d) present the spectral distribution (26) of the radiation emitted
along the undulator axis, ¯h−1
iϑ=0◦, for 5 GeV positron channeling along
(110) planes in Si and W crystals. The spectra were calculated by using the parameters
λ and p as indicated in table 1 in the lines C = 0.15 for Si, and C = 0.05 for W. The
number of the undulator periods varied from N = 4 N c
d, as in ﬁgures 9(a,c) and the

dEN /dω dΩn

30

solid curves in ﬁgures 9(b,d), to N = N c
d/2 (the long-dashed lines in ﬁgures 9(b,d)).
For ﬁxed λ diﬀerent values of N can be achieved by changing the length of the crystal.
The sinusoidal proﬁle of the channel bending can be created by applying the transverse
acoustic wave. The velocities of the transverse supersonic waves propagating along (110)
directions are equal 5.84 cm/s for Si [60] and 5.17 cm/s for W crystal [61]. Thus, the
corresponding frequencies of the acoustic wave needed to to obtain λ = 63.0 µm in Si
and λ = 42.2 µm in W (see the table) are: νSi = 93 MHz, νW = 123 MHz.

The upper ﬁgures illustrate the structure of the spectral distribution in wide ranges

harmonics [24, 16], the energies of which follow from (21) if putting ϑ = 0◦. It is seen

Figures 9(b,d) exhibit, in more detail, the structure of the ﬁrst-harmonic peaks. For
the sake of comparison we plotted the curves corresponding to diﬀerent values of the
undulator periods. It is seen that for N > N c
d the intensity of the peaks is no longer
proportional to N 2, as it is in the case of the ideal undulator without the dechanneling
of the particles (Section 2). For both Si and W crystals, the intensities of the radiation
calculated at N
d (the thick solid curves in the
ﬁgures) only by several per cent. Thus, the solid lines correspond to almost saturated
intensities which are the maximal ones for the used crystals, projectile energies and
the parameters of the crystalline undulator. It is worth noting that these intensities,
obtained with realistic values of the dechanneling lengths Lc
d, are noticeably higher than
the ones corresponding to N > N e
d (the thin solid lines in the ﬁgures). The latter were
used in [2] for the estimations of the yield of the AIR, both spontaneous and stimulated.
It it seen from the ﬁgure that our earlier estimations were adequate for light crystals
(the maximum of the thick solid curve exceeds that of the thin one by a factor of 3.5)
but they essentially underestimated the yield of the AIR in heavy crystals, where the
ratio of the intensities is almost 10.

It is known from general theory of the undulator radiation by an ultra-relativistic
projectile [24, 16] that it is emitted into the narrow cone along the undulator axis.
The opening angle of this cone, ϑc depends on the two parameters, namely, on the
relativistic factor γ and on the undulator parameter p. For p2
1 (the so-called dipole
1/γ. In the
case) the radiation is concentrated within the cone with the opening angle
opposite limit, p2
p/γ.
Uniting both limiting cases one can state that for given γ and p the maximum angle of
the emission can be estimated as ϑc ∼
1. In the case of a planar

9 (a) and (c). The radiation into the odd harmonics dominates over the even-harmonics
peaks which, nevertheless, become visible in contrast with the case of emission at ϑ = 0.
As the cone of emission becomes larger (the graphs (c)-(e) in the ﬁgures) the width
of the peaks grows and their shape becomes asymmetric. The enhancement of the
width follows from eq. (21) which connects the harmonics frequencies with the emission
angle, and from ﬁgure 2. For a given number k of the harmonic its frequency ωk(ϑ)
is the decreasing function of the emission angle, so that the center of the peak shifts
towards lower values of the frequency as ϑ grows. Hence, the integration of (26) over
the interval ϑ, ϑ + ∆ϑ leads to the appearing of the emission within the frequency range

[ωk(ϑ)

∆ω, ωk(ϑ)] where

We illustrate this estimate by ﬁgure 12, where the graphs (a)-(e) correspond to the
contributions of diﬀerent intervals of the emission angle to the spectral distribution
of the AIR for 5 GeV positron in tungsten. It is clearly seen that each interval of θ
corresponds to the emission radiated within particular ranges of ω.

In ﬁgures 10 and 11 the graphs (e) correspond to the value ϑmax = 0.5 ϑc for the
upper limit of integration over the emission angles. It is seen that initially well-separated
narrow peaks (the graphs (a)) have merged, except for the ﬁrst three harmonics. The
further increase of ϑmax up to ϑc produces the continuous spectrum of radiation although
with the irregularities in the vicinities of ωk(0).

7. Conclusions

In this work we have described the general formalism and the algorithm for eﬀective
calculations of the characteristics of the AIR as well as of the dechanneling length of
positrons in periodically bent crystals.

The calculations performed in the present paper conﬁrm the main result of our
previous considerations concerning the possibility to create a powerful and easily tunable
source of monochromatic radiation in the X or/and γ range by means of crystalline

35

undulator. They also demonstrate that the knowledge of the accurate values of the
dechanneling lengths for various projectile energies, crystals and crystallographic palnes,
and various parameters of the proﬁle function S(z) is essential for obtaining reliable data
on the intensity of the AIR.

The numeric results presented above refer to a particular shape of the bent channel
which can be achieved by applying monochromatic transverse supersonic wave. However,
both the formalism and the computer code allows to investigate, by comparatively simple
means, the radiative spectra formed during the channeling of ultra-relativistic positrons
along the crystallographic planes whose shape is described by arbitrary periodic shape
function.

In this connection we want to mention the problem concerning the possibility to
generate the AIR photons not in the range of up to several MeV but much higher. It can
be achieved by using positron beams of higher energies, ε = 10 . . . 100 GeV. The increase
of ε results in the increase of both the emitted photon energies and the dechanneling
length. The latter leads to the increase in the intensity of the AIR. The obvious diﬃculty
of the stable work of the crystalline undulator in this range of ε is in sharp increase of
the radiative energy losses which are mainly due the ordinary channeling radiation. The
radiative losses lead to a noticeable decrease of the projectile energy during the passage
through the undulator. Hence, the use of the shape function with constant parameters
a and λ does not result in the intensive monochromatic undulator radiation. However,
we believe, that this problem can be overcome by considering S(z) with the varied
parameters, a(z) and λ(z). Then, provided the dependence ε(z) (z = ct) is known it
is possible to adjust the parameters a(z), λ(z) so that the characteristic frequencies of
the AIR will not change as the projectile penetrates through the crystal, and, therefore,
the monochromaticity will be restored. This work is in progress at the moment and will
become the subject of another publication in the near future.

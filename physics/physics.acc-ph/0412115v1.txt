Future electron-positron linear colliders require a highly polarized electron beam
with a pulse structure that depends primarily on whether the acceleration utilizes
warm or superconducting rf structures. The International Linear Collider (ILC)
will use cold structures for the main linac. It is shown that a dc-biased polarized
photoelectron source such as successfully used for the SLC can meet the charge
requirements for the ILC micropulse with a polarization approaching 90%.

1. Charge

The SLAC Linear Collider (SLC) established that reliable electron beams
with a polarization at high energy approaching 80% can be provided over
periods of years. However, the beam pulse structures planned for future
colliders present new demands. The ILC beam at the interaction point (IP)
is expected to consist of a train micropulses spaced ∼300 ns apart. If one
assumes that at the source it is prudent to be able to generate at least twice
the charge required at the IP, then the charge, pulse length, and average
current for each micropulse is indicated in Table 1 and compared with
both the Next Linear Collider (NLC) and SLC designs. The ILC linac will
use superconducting (SC) L-band (LB) rf for the main linac, but normal

conducting (NC) rf is a possibility for the initial acceleration including the
injector.

Highly polarized electrons for linac beams are generated by illuminat-
ing a p-doped GaAs (or its analogues) crystal with circularly polarized
monochromatic light tuned to the band-gap edge. The absorbed photons
promote electrons from ﬁlled valance band states to the conduction band
(CB). If an atomically-clean crystal surface is treated with a Cs-oxide layer,
then combined with the band-bending the work function can be lowered to
below the vacuum level, resulting in a negative electron aﬃnity (NEA) sur-
face from which CB electrons reaching the surface are readily extracted by
applying a negative bias.

The activated cathode is extremely sensitive to any contamination. To
reduce ﬁeld emission to near-zero, the SLC gun was operated with a bias of
only -120 kV, which resulted in ﬁelds of ∼1.8 and 7 MV/m on the cathode
crystal and electrode respectively1. Under these conditions, space charge
will limit the peak current that can be extracted to 11 A, assuming a fully
illuminated round crystal of diameter 2 cm. A practical micropulse with
temporal and spatial shapes approximating a Gaussian will be limited to
average currents that are signiﬁcantly lower than the space charge limit
(SCL); e.g., ∼7 A in the SLC case2.

If the beam generated by the source can be accelerated with the same
micropulse spacing as at the IP, then Table 1 shows there is no SCL problem
regardless of whether the initial accelerating rf is SC or NC. However, if
the initial accelerating rf is NC-SB to accommodate some possible damping
ring designs, then the SCL could become a problem as illustrated in the
3rd column of values.

charge limit.

2. Polarization

The highest electron-beam polarization is achieved using crystals in which
the natural degeneracy of the heavy- and light-hole energy bands at the
valence-band maximum is removed. This is accomplished by introducing a
lattice mismatch with the substrate or by using a short-period superlattice
structure for the epilayer. By using a combination of both techniques, a
separation of 50-80 meV is readily achieved. This is suﬃcient to tune a
laser to promote electrons to the CB from the heavy-hole band only, giving
promise of 100% polarization. In practice polarizations ≥ 90% have been
reported3, and the recent parity-violating asymmetry experiment at SLAC
using the 50-GeV polarized electron beam, E-158, measured Pe = 85%
in the early phase with a strained-layer crystal, and in the ﬁnal phase an
online value of Pe = 90% using a strained superlattice crystal. In Table 2,
a comparison of polarization results for 3 photocathodes representing these
2 structures is presented. The crystal operating temperature was either
warm (∼20◦ ) or cold (∼0◦ ).

The polarization of accelerator beams is made at low energy with Mott
polarimeters and at high energy with typically Møller or Compton polarime-
ters. The two oﬄine Mott polarimeters developed for the SLC are still in
use. These polarimeters gave results that were consistent with the SLC
Compton polarimeter (accuracy of < 0.5%) within 2% after corrections for
known depolarization in the transmission to the IP.

to another for the same crystal structure, and can even vary by a few
percent for a single crystal depending on surface conditions, it has been
very diﬃcult to compare the polarization results between diﬀerent facilities.
Some insight into the accuracy of the polarimeters themselves was recently
gained in an experiment at JLAB in which the polarized electron beam was
switched on a pulse-to-pulse basis between 3 diﬀerent Møller polarimeters
and a Compton polarimeter, all at high energy, and compared with an inline
Mott polarimeter at low energy7. Undetected systematic eﬀects and errors
in the simulated values of the eﬀective analyzing powers were revealed at
the level of several percent.

As shown in Table 2, the higher polarization using cathode 1b relative
to cathode 2 is the same when measured by 2 independent polarimeters.
If the E158 Møller polarization data—corrected for the 1% depolarization
between source and polarimeter—for a GaAsP/GaAs strained superlattice
crystal is combined with the SLAC Mott measurements made with a cath-
ode crystal cut from the same wafer, the result is a polarization at the
source of (88± 4)%.

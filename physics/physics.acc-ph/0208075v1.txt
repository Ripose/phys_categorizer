Equilibrium Distribution and Tune Shift of Beams in a Linear Collider

The evolution of two colliding beams in a linear accelerator can be described by two coupled
Vlasov equations. In [1] the case without external focusing was considered. In this paper we derive
the equilibrium distribution and the tune shift in the presence of external focusing. Motion is
considered only in the vertical direction and the beams are presumed to be one-dimensional.

I. BEAM EVOLUTION

The beam-beam force due to the ﬁrst (second) beam on the second (ﬁrst) one is given by

where N is the particle density in a bunch and re the classical radius of the electron. The distributions of the beams
ψ1 and ψ2 are normalized to unity, i.e.

Then ψ1,2 satisfy the Vlasov equations

II. EQUILIBRIUM DISTRIBUTION

We are interested in ﬁnding an equilibrium (i.e. time-independent) distribution ψ0. The ansatz

ψ1(y, y′, s) = ψ2(y, y′, s) = ψ0(y, y′

)

simpliﬁes eqn. 3 signiﬁcantly.

where f is any arbitrary function whose derivative exists. This equilibrium distribution ψ0 must satisfy the normaliza-
tion condition eqn. 2. We choose an exponential function because the beams going into the collision from a damping
ring have an approximately Gaussian distribution. Dividing both sides by the derivative with respect to y′ and taking
the derivative with respect to y we obtain the following ordinary diﬀerential equation

Depending on the constants Y (y) describes single Gaussian-like functions, a nearly periodic sum of Gaussian-like
functions or oscillating functions. Because Gaussian beams enter the collision, we are interested in the case of a
Gaussian-like Y (y). Thus, we choose the ansatz

This leads to the identiﬁcation σ = β

If ξ is suﬃciently high the expression inside the root will become negative or - at a particular ξ - the denominator
will vanish. Therefore, ξ has to obey the inequality

since the design tune has to be ﬁnite and real.

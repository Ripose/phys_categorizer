Real and Image Fields of a Relativistic Bunch

Abstract

We derive analytical expressions for external ﬁelds of a charged relativistic bunch
with a circular cross section. At distances far from the bunch, the ﬁeld reduces
to the relativistic modiﬁed Coulomb form and in the near region, reproduce the
external ﬁelds of a continuous beam. If the bunch is surrounded by conducting
surfaces, the bunch self-ﬁelds are modiﬁed. Image ﬁelds generated by a bunch
between two parallel conducting planes are studied in detail. Exact summation
of image ﬁelds by the direct method invented by Laslett allows the inﬁnite series
to be represented in terms of elementary trigonometric functions.

1 Introduction

In an accelerator, the charged beam is inﬂuenced by an environment (beam pipe, accelerator
gaps, magnets, collimators, etc.), and a high-intensity bunch induces surface charges or
currents into this environment. This modiﬁes the electric and magnetic ﬁelds around the
bunch. There is a relatively simple method to account for the eﬀect of the environment by
introducing image charges and currents.

Over forty years ago Laslett [1] analyzed the inﬂuence of the transverse space-charge
phenomena, due to image forces, on the instability of the coherent transverse motion of an
intense beam. Methods of image ﬁelds summation are described in his paper [1] which pre-
sented some ﬁeld coeﬃcients calculated for inﬁnite parallel plate vacuum chambers, magnetic
poles and vacuum chambers with elliptical cross sections and variable aspect rations. The
resulting image ﬁeld was calculated only in the linear approximation and depends linearly on
the deviations ¯x and x of the bunch center and the position of a test particle, respectively,
from the axis. They act therefore like a quadrupole causing a coherent tune shift. The
approximation used is incorrect if the ﬁeld observation point x is located far from the bunch
or if the bunch center is close to a conducting wall.

In the present paper we consider the problem of the image ﬁeld summation once again for
a very simple geometry, namely, a relativistic bunch moving between inﬁnitely wide parallel
conducting planes. The problem is far from being a pure academic one [2]. In applications,
in particular by study of the electron cloud eﬀect [3] and the dynamics of photoelectrons in
the beam transport system, it is important to know the distribution of electromagnetic ﬁelds
not only in vicinity of the bunch, but in the whole gap. We did not ﬁnd publications with
attempts to sum up the series (17) in an approximation beyond the linear one. In Section 3
we present the exact solution of the problem.

To solve the problem formulated above, in Section 2 we ﬁrst derive an equation for the
external electromagnetic ﬁeld generated by a cylindrical bunch of charged particles. The
task is speciﬁed as follows.

tions (1) and (2) are used to describe ﬁelds of an individual bunch too. However, in the form
(1), (2) the bunch ﬁelds do not depend on the bunch energy and at large distances do not
follow the Coulomb asymptotic. This contrasts sharply with the ﬁelds produced (at t = 0)

2 Self-Fields of a Charged Finite Cylinder
with a Circular Cross Section

Let us consider a bunch of charged particles uniformly distributed with a density ρ within a
cylinder of length L and an elliptical cross section. The ellipsoid semi-axis in the x-y plane
are a and b and the coordinate z-axis is along the bunch axis. Suppose that the bunch is
moving along the z-axis with a relativistic velocity ~v = c~β.

To compute the radial electric ﬁeld of such a rapidly moving bunch, we have to sum up

ﬁelds of the type (3), generated by the bunch constituents. In this way we get [4]

E⊥(r, ξ, z) = κργ{zI1 + (L − z)I2}

with

I1 =

where σ is the distance in the x-y plane from the z-axis to the elementary charged volume

Equation (5) represents the radial electric ﬁeld as observed at a distance r from the bunch
axis, at an angle ξ relative to the x axis and at a distance z from the bunch tail.

The integrals I1 and I2 can be estimated only numerically [4], if integrands are taken as
it is. However, the integrands are easy to simplify if the bunch is relativistic, γ ≫ 1, and we
would like calculate the ﬁeld in vicinity of the bunch, r ∼ L, but at distances much larger
than the bunch radius, b ≪ r.

To simplify, we make use of the notation

and the integrand of I1 can be written as

(r2 + γ2z2)

−1/2A(1 − B)(1 + Y )

−1/2 .

Now we expand the above expression in a power series by using A as a small parameter and
keeping only terms up to the power A4 at each step. For the bunch shaped as a circular
cylinder, a = b and we may set ξ = 0. Due to the fact that

2π

cos2k+1 φ dφ = 0,

all odd power of B vanish after integration in φ. This greatly simpliﬁes the series generated
from (9). After lengthy algebraic manipulations with (9), we get

The ﬁeld of a relativistic bunch described by (14), has diﬀerent behavior at distances far
apart of the bunch and in the near region, r ≤ L. At very large distances, r ≫ γz and
r ≫ γ(L − z), equation (14) reduces to the Coulomb form (4). At the same time, in the near
region and beyond the bunch tails, γz ≈ γ(L − z) ≫ r and equation (14) simpliﬁes to

which coincide with the external ﬁeld (1) of a continuous beam with λ = N/L.

3 Fields from Image Charges

Following Laslett [1] (see also [5]), we consider a relativistic bunch of the length L between
inﬁnitely wide conducting planes at x = ±h. Suppose that constituents of the bunch are
positively charged. For full generality, let the circular particle bunch be displaced in the
horizontal plane by ¯x from the midplane (0,y,z), and the observation point of the ﬁeld be
at (x, 0, 0) between the conducting parallel planes. The end points of the bunch are at
z = ±L/2. The boundary condition for electric ﬁelds is Ez(±h) = 0 on the conducting plane
and is satisﬁed if the image charges change sign from image to image. Suppose that the
distance between planes is of the order L. Thus, the electric ﬁeld of each image is described
by (15). To calculate the image electric ﬁeld E⊥,image(x) in front of the plate, we add the
contributions from all image ﬁelds in the inﬁnite series [1]

where x1 = x + ¯x and x2 = x − ¯x. These image ﬁelds must be added to the direct ﬁeld of the
bunch (15) to meet the boundary condition that the electric ﬁeld enters conducting surfaces
perpendicularly.

In the original paper [1], the series (17) was summed up only in the linear approximation

in x and ¯x,

E⊥,image(x, ¯x) = κ

h2 (2¯x + x).

The coeﬃcient ǫ1 = π2/48 is known as the Laslett coeﬃcient (or form factor) for inﬁnite
parallel plate vacuum chambers and magnetic poles. The approximation used in (18) is
incorrect if the deviation of the bunch center from the axis is large (¯x ∼ h) or if the ﬁeld
observation point x is located far oﬀ the bunch. Therefore, below we present the exact
solution of the problem.

In Appendixes A and B we prove that the exact summation of the series (17) gives

where the image ﬁeld structure function Λ depends only on normalized variables δ = x/h,
¯δ = ¯x/h in the form

In Appendix A it is shown that in the linear approximation equation (19) recovers the part
(18) derived by Laslett.

We shall now estimate values of the function Λ in several particular points. If the obser-
vation point of the ﬁeld is located at the plane, x = h, then δ = 1 and the structure function
depends only on the bunch center position between planes, ¯δ. Thus, from (20) we get

Equation (21) is singular at ¯δ → 1 and shows that the conducting plane attracts the bunch
with increasing force with the bunch displacement from the midplane. This phenomenon,
involving the transverse movement of the bunch as a whole, arises from image forces and
could lead to a transverse instability.

For a bunch in the midplane, ¯δ = 0, the summed image ﬁeld at the surface equals

E⊥,image(h, 0) = κ

The image ﬁeld (19) must be added to the direct ﬁeld of the bunch (15) to meet the

boundary condition. Thus

For a bunch in the midplane, ¯δ = 0, we ﬁnd from (23) the expression of the transverse

parallel planes

That is, at the surface, δ = 1, the ﬁeld is enhanced by a factor π/2 due to the presence of
the conducting planes.

Notice that in the linear approximation (18) the ﬁeld gradient, ∂E⊥/∂x, is independent
of position x. Thus the tune shift experienced by each particle in the bunch is the same
(a coherent tune shift). However, the exact result (19) demonstrates that the coherence is
violated and equation (19) allows us to estimate the accuracy of the linear approximation.

4 Magnetic Images

In the above, we have used electrostatic images. Magnetic images can be treated in much
the same way. Let the ferromagnetic boundaries be represented by a pair of inﬁnitely wide
parallel surfaces at x = ±g. The magnetic ﬁeld lines must enter the magnetic pole faces
perpendicularly. For magnetic image ﬁelds we distinguish between DC and AC image ﬁelds.
The DC ﬁeld penetrates the metallic vacuum chamber and reaches the ferromagnetic poles.
In case of bunched beams the AC ﬁelds are of rather high frequency and we assume that
they do not penetrate the thick metallic vacuum chamber.

The DC Fourier component of a bunched beam current is equal to twice the average

beam current qcβλB [5], where B is the the Laslett bunching factor. Thus,

5 Summary

We have derived an approximate expressions for electric (14) and magnetic (16) self-ﬁelds
produced by a relativistic circular bunch with uniform charge density. They show that at
distances far from the bunch the electromagnetic ﬁeld coinsides with the ﬁeld generated by a
point-like charged paricle. At the same time, in the near region and beyond the bunch tails,
the ﬁelds coincide with the external self-ﬁelds of a continuous beam (1)-(2).

We re-analyzed the problem of summing the image ﬁelds generated by a bunch of charged
particles moving with a relativistic velocity between inﬁnitely wide parallel conducting planes.
The exact solution of the problem represented by the structure function of image ﬁelds Λ
(20) depending only of the normalized variables.

An inspection of (37) shows that the contributions of negative charged images are enhanced
by the factor 22n − 1, as compared with the contributions from the positive charged images.
Equation (37) also shows that for x in the bunch center, δ2 = 0 and the contributions from
the positive charged images are vanish.

At the ﬁnal step, it is possible to rewrite the inﬁnite series (37) in terms of elementary
trigonometric functions. To do this, recall the relations between the Bernoulli numbers and
the trigonometric functions [8],[9]

Equations (37), (40) and (41) were derived assuming δ < 1 and ¯δ < 1. Therefore, one
cast doubts on validity of (41) at δ ∼ 1, near the conducting plane. For that reason in the
next section we re-expand the series (28) into a power series of new small parameters.

B Image Fields in Vicinity of a Conducting Plane

A similar derivation is used to obtain the ﬁeld structure near a conducting surface. For
the case under consideration we have to choose new small parameters for the expansion.
Each bracket in (28) we represent in the form (1 ± ∆)−1 and expand in series, recalling that
at the plane x ≈ h,

To perform the summation in (55), we have to split the series (55) into even, n = 2i, and
odd, n = 2i − 1 parts and substitute (53), (54) in equation (55)

The structure function Λ(∆1, ∆2), as written in (61), looks very diﬀerent from (40). However,
it is not diﬃcult to check that by use of the relations ∆1 = 1 − δ1 and ∆2 = 1 − δ2, equation
(61) transforms in (40) or (41).

In this way we ensure that equations (40), (41) and (61) are correct and represent exact
summation of image ﬁelds generated by a charged bunch between inﬁnitely wide conducting
planes.

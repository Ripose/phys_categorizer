Abstract

The exact solution of the Dirac equation and the spectrum of electron quasi-
energies in a superposition of the ﬁeld of a circularly polarized electromagnetic
wave and a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the direction of wave prop-
agation, are found taking into account the anomalous magnetic moment. It is
found that taking account of the anomalous magnetic moment removes the spin
degeneracy and that for intense ﬁelds the levels change radically. The shift of the
radiation frequency due to the intensity of the wave ﬁeld is found. This shift can
be considerable.

The exact solutions of the Dirac equation in a superposition of a homogeneous mag-
netic ﬁeld ~
and a classical monochromatic electromagnetic wave ﬁeld propagating
B
along ~
(the so-called Redmond conﬁguration) were found for the ﬁrst time in [1].
B
In [2] a transformation was introduced, in analogy with the Volkov solution [3], which
reduces the solution of the Dirac equation for ﬁelds of the Redmond conﬁguration to
a product of the solution of a Klein-Gordon equation for these ﬁelds and a bispinor
of a free particle. Wave functions of this form facilitate the physical interpretation,
calculation and analysis of spin phenomena.

In this paper an exact solution of the Dirac equation and the spectrum of particle
quasi-energies for ﬁelds of the Redmond conﬁguration is found, taking into account the
electron anomalous magnetic moment. We consider the case of circular wave polariza-
tion using the method suggested in [2]. In addition, electron and positron states are
distinguished by introducing the quantum number qv which is positive and negative for
electrons and positrons respectively.

Furthermore, it is shown that by taking into account the electron anomalous mag-
netic moment the degeneracy in the quantum spin states is removed. Moreover, owing
to the presence of the anomalous magnetic moment and at certain values of other pa-
rameters, the relative positions of the quasi–energy levels are radically changed. This
latter is important for the consideration of spin eﬀects. The establishment of the quasi–
energy spectrum allows us to obtain the photon absorption and radiation spectrum. It
is found that the radiation frequency is shifted because of the inﬂuence of the intensity
of the wave ﬁeld and that this shift can be considerable.

These theoretical considerations are of direct relevance for various applications: laser
acceleration [4]; electron–positron pair creation at high wave ﬁeld intensities [5]; fast
measurement of the absolute energy of charged unpolarized particles with a relative
4 over a wide energy range up to TeV energies, and so on. It is important
precision of 10−
that during the measurement of the energy of longitudinally spin–polarized electrons
by this method, the degree of polarization does not decrease.

2 The solution of the Dirac equation

In this section we derive the solution of the Dirac equation in the ﬁeld of an elec-
tromagnetic wave and a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld taking account of the electron
anomalous magnetic moment. We describe the external ﬁelds in terms of a classical
vector-potential

corresponds to a positron state [6].

4 The photon absorption and radiation spectrum

For absorption of a photon with 4–momentum kµ(ω; ~k) by an electron moving at an
angle θ = 0 to the z–axis, the energy–momentum conservation law reads as:

From this and using Qµ from (46) we ﬁnd that the photon absorption frequency ω is:

Qµ + kµ = Q′

µ.

γωc[2(n′

ω =

n) + (ζ ′
1 + ζG

.

(64)

(65)

For G = 0 and without spin ﬂip the frequency ω coincides with that found earlier by
classical methods.

13

We see from (65) that if there is no spin ﬂip, the frequencies of the Q0 spectrum are
equally spaced. Then the electron can resonantly absorb a succession of photons of the
same frequency and accelerate.

For radiation of a photon with 4–momentum k′(ω′; ~k′) by an electron the energy–

momentum conservation equation is given by:

Qµ + νkµ = Q′

µ + k′

µ

where the coeﬃcient ν denotes the number of photons absorbed from the wave ﬁeld.

From (66) and using Qµ from (46) we ﬁnd a cubic equation for the frequency spec-

of an electromagnetic wave on free electrons — especially near resonance when δ

Because the intensity of the radiation increases near resonance like ξ2/δ2 [12], the
resonance condition ω = 2γωc can be used for measurement of the particle energy
and then the shift of the radiation frequency ω′ (69) compared to the incident laser
frequency ω allows incident and radiated photons to be distinguished [13].

Note that the resonance condition ω = 2γωc is easy to realise using existing powerful
lasers (with ξ up to 1) for reasonable values of the parameters γ and ωc. For example
at an electron energy of 500 GeV and a laser wavelength λw = 0.248µm (¯hω = 5eV )
= 220 Gs.

5 Summary

We have found the wave functions (45) and electron quasi-energy spectrum (46) and (56)
in a superposition of a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld ~
and a classical circularly polarized
B
wave propagating along ~
for an electron with anomalous magnetic moment. The
B
factorized wave functions (45) facilitate calculations for processes involving particles
with spin since the bispinor Uq,ζ satisﬁes the equation for a free particle.

Taking account of the electron anomalous magnetic moment removes the degeneracy
of the quantum spin states. For intense wave ﬁelds, i.e. when aξ2/δ2
1 the relative
positions of the quasi–energy levels with opposite spin direction change radically (Fig.
2).

≫

We have considered the photon absorption and radiation spectrum and have found
a dependence of the shift of the radiation frequency on the intensity of the wave ﬁeld.
In addition we suggest a new method for measuring the electron energy by observing
the radiation intensity near resonance. This will be discussed in more detail in a later
paper. This method could also be used for ultra high energy muons [14].

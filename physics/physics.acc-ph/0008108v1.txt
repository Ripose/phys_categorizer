Estimates of Dispersive Effects in a Bent NLC Main Linac∗

Abstract
An alternative being considered for the Next Linear Col-
lider (NLC) is not to tunnel in a straight line but to bend
the Main Linac into an arc so as to follow an equipotential.
We begin here an examination of the effects that this would
have on vertical dispersion, with its attendant consequences
on synchrotron radiation and emittance growth by looking
at two scenarios: a gentle continuous bending of the beam
to follow an equipotential surface, and an introduction of
sharp bends at a few sites in the linac so as to reduce the
maximum sagitta produced.

1 CONTINUAL GENTLE BENDS

In our ﬁrst scenario, the Main Linac remains as close as
possible to an equipotential surface. Minimalism suggests
that we try bending the beam by vertically translating al-
ready existing NLC quadrupoles, without introducing new
elements or additional magnetic ﬁelds. We thus propose
that steering be accomplished by precisely aligning all the
quads “level” along the equipotential and then raising the
vertically defocusing (D) quadrupoles to steer the beam
through the centers of the vertically focusing (F) quads. 1
Bending at the D quad locations will minimize the gener-
ated dispersion.

To estimate the order of magnitude of dispersion pro-
duced by such an arrangement, we calculate (a) assuming
a periodic sequence of magnets while (b) neglecting the ef-
fects of acceleration [1] and (c) keeping only leading terms
in the bend angle. Our results will be reasonably correct
provided that upstream injection into the Main Linac is re-
designed to match the new arrangement. Further details of
the calculation and others discussed in this paper are docu-
mented elsewhere. [2]

Figure 1 shows the physical layout of quadrupoles and
identiﬁes the geometric parameters.
It is practical to
write the vertical offset of the quadrupole relative to the
equipotential, d − ysag. In terms of the distance between
quadrupoles, L, the local betatron phase advance per cell,
µ, and the radius of the earth, R, this offset is

thin quad calculations.

(1) in passing through a thin bending magnet, the slope of
the dispersion function, D′, changes by an amount approx-
imately equal to the bend angle; (2) by symmetry, the dis-
persion attains its maximum (minimum) value at the center
of the focussing (defocussing) quadrupole. The values of
the dispersion function at the thin-lens quadrupoles will be

Dmin =

Dmax =

.

Using the same parameters as before, this provides the

numerical estimate, at the high energy end of the linac,

Dmin = 0.032 mm, Dmax = 0.11 mm.

If we take a large ∆p/p ≈ ∆E/E = 0.02, because of
BNS damping, and assume that the “invariant emittance”
γǫy/π ≈ 100 nm and βy ≈ 40 m at a point where the elec-
tron’s energy is E = 100 GeV, then Dmax · ∆p
p = 2.2 µm
compared to σy = pβyǫy/π = 4.6 µm.

Vertical bending will produce synchrotron radiation,
which, in its turn, will add to the vertical emittance of the
beam. At high energy, the total energy radiated by one elec-
tron is given by the expression,2

To make a numerical estimate of this offset at the high en-
ergy end of the linac, we take L ≈ 19 m, µ ≈ π/2, and
R ≈ 6400 km. Eq.(1) then yields d − ysag ≈ 108 µm. The
dispersion can be estimated easily using two observations:

where, ρ is the bend radius, γ is the relativistic

1/p1 − (v/c)2, and the other variables need no introduc-

tion. In terms of the electron energy, E, and the bend angle,

considering dynamics only in the vertical plane.

Using the same parameters as before, θ ≈ 5.6 µrad;
at the high energy end of the linac, E ≈ 500 GeV, and
ℓ ≈ 1 m; our estimate of the total radiated energy (per elec-
tron per bend) is about 28 keV. Put another way, the ra-
tio, U/E ≈ 6 × 10−8. It is inconceivable that such a small
fractional change in beam energy could seriously damage
the emittance, but we will estimate its effect anyway. The
additional invariant emittance due to synchrotron radiation
is approximated as

Plugging in the same numbers as before, estimating
βy ≈ 60 m, and using our previous estimates for U and
Dmax, we obtain, ∆(γǫy/π) ≈ 1.8 × 10−7 nm – as ex-
pected, a very small number.

2 LOCALIZED SHARP BENDS

Although the 2 µm offset of an off-momentum particle pre-
dicted in the previous section is not catastrophic, neither is
it completely negligible. We will now consider eliminating
it by employing the second scenario: constructing a Main
Linac that is laser straight except for highly localized bends
at a few, widely separated locations. These bend sites then
allow us to follow the equipotential in a coarser, piece-wise
fashion. If we think of bending every kilometer, or so, then
the bend angle should be about 160 µrad. We’ll take this as
the “canonical” value for calculations in this section.

We will proceed again in a minimalist way.

In order
to minimize the modiﬁcation of existing lattice hardware
and optics, we adopt the use of combined function mag-
nets to both bend and focus the electron beam. Other pos-
sibilities could be considered at a later date.
If we only
“bend” at each of the local sites, a dispersion wave of am-
plitude ∼ 4 mm would be generated at each bend center.
To match the trajectories at the end of each local bending
region for particles with various momenta, the total bend
angle of each region is distributed across four neighboring
(combined function) dipoles. The strategy is akin to that
of an 18th century optician designing a simple focussing
achromat.

The results at the lowest energy bending location are
shown in Figure 2. The dashed line follows the residual
dispersion, now completely contained within the ≈ 40 m
long bending region, with maximum amplitude of about
0.6 mm. The maximum orbit distortion of 1 mm is too
large an offset from the central (curved) axis of the local
bending magnets. They would have to be displaced so as to
follow the new orbit. A few iterations of these manipula-
tions should then converge on an acceptable design. How-
ever, the ﬁnal orbit and its local residual dispersion should
not be much different from what we have calculated here.
For now, we simply display these results as indicating the
order of magnitude of the effects.

The distortions in the trajectory at ten locations located
∼1 km apart in the NLC are of the order 1-2 mm, with
the higher displacements occuring at the higher energies.
The corresponding dispersions generated along the linac
are shown in Figure 3. A residual dispersion of 1 mm re-
mains in the neighborhood of the bends. Again assuming
that ∆p/p ≈ 0.02, we have Dmax · ∆p
p = 20 µm compared
to σy = pβmaxǫy/π = 4.6 µm. This is a large increase,
but it exists only near the bend sites. Away from these sites,
the dispersion is (essentially) zero, and its contribution to
emittance is negligible. We note in passing that an advan-
tage of this calculation is that one can envision making it
operational.

Finally, we estimate the synchrotron radiation and emit-
tance growth incurred by our second scenario, once again
using Eqs.(2) and (3). The values of ∆(γǫy/π) at all bend
locations are plotted in Figure 4. Each site contains one

becomes overwhelming. Even so, the additional ≈ 1 nm in

In passing, we note that some attention should be given
to coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) from individual
bunches. A quick look[2] shows that the current NLC de-
sign has an aperture a ≈ 7 mm, so CSR is forbidden, even
at the high energy end of the linac, because of “shielding”
from the walls of the beam pipe. However, the margin of
safety is not comfortably large. It may be necessary to re-
examine this issue.

Results with accelerating gradients of 50 MeV/m and

This conclusion is illustrated in Figure 5. The emittance
growth due to synchrotron radiation is also plotted, show-
ing that a growth of ∆(γǫy/π) = 100 nm (roughly equal to
the NLC nominal design value at collision) occurs well be-
fore the ﬁnal energy is reached, with the emittance growth
being a steep function of energy (∼ γ6). For 50 MeV/m,
the practical limit of a curved linac may be only about 2-
3 TeV per beam, which would have a length of about 50
km. For 150 MeV/m, the limits are 3-4 TeV per beam over
about 20 km. Note that a “laser straight” linear collider
with 20 km per linac, and a lengthy interaction region, with
its two ends near the surface of the earth would have its
collision point located roughly 50 m below the surface.

While present NLC designs with beam energies in the
range of a few hundred GeV to 1 TeV may not be very
sensitive to the curvature of the earth, there will be a prac-
tical limit to the upgraded energy of such a device. Suppose
the scheme of steering the beam with offset quadrupoles is
adopted. Then, at high energies, eventually the energy gain
within a FODO cell will be equal to the energy lost due
to synchrotron radiation as the beam is bent by the offset
quadrupole. This limit can be easily written as

Elim = (cid:18) π

Cγ

ℓq
L

EcvR2(cid:19)1/4

where Ecv is the energy gain per meter of the linac. As the
energy is increased, both the quadrupole length (strength)
and the half-cell length increase roughly proportionally. As
an example, using Ecv = 50 MeV/m, and ℓq/L = 0.025,
then we get Elim ≈ 6.5 TeV.

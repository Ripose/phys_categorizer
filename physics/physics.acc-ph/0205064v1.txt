Abstract

Based on the Vlasov-Maxwell equations describing the
self-consistent nonlinear beam dynamics and collective
processes, the evolution of an intense sheet beam prop-
agating through a periodic focusing ﬁeld has been stud-
ied.
In an earlier paper [1] it has been shown that in
the case of a beam with uniform phase space density the
Vlasov-Maxwell equations can be replaced exactly by the
macroscopic warm ﬂuid-Maxwell equations with a triple
adiabatic pressure law. In this paper we demonstrate that
starting from the macroscopic ﬂuid-Maxwell equations a
nonlinear Schroedinger equation for the slowly varying
wave amplitude (or a set of coupled nonlinear Schroedinger
equations for the wave amplitudes in the case of multi-wave
interactions) can be derived. Properties of the nonlinear
Schroedinger equation are discussed, together with soliton
formation in intense particle beams.

INTRODUCTION

Of particular importance in modern accelerators and
storage rings operating at high beam currents and charge
densities are the effects of the intense self-ﬁelds produced
by the beam space charge and current on determining de-
tailed equilibrium, stability and transport properties.
In
general, a complete description of collective processes in
intense charged particle beams is provided by the Vlasov-
Maxwell equations for the self-consistent evolution of the
beam distribution function and the electromagnetic ﬁelds.
As shown in [1] in the case of a sheet beam with con-
stant phase-space density the Vlasov-Maxwell equations
are fully equivalent to a warm-ﬂuid model with zero heat
ﬂow and triple-adiabatic equation-of-state.

In the present paper we demonstrate that starting from
the hydrodynamic equations, and using the renormalization
group (RG) technique [2, 3, 4, 5] a nonlinear Schroedinger
equation for the slowly varying single-wave amplitude can
be derived. The renormalized solution for the beam den-
sity describes the process of formation of periodic holes in
intense particle beams.

3 RENORMALIZATION GROUP

REDUCTION OF THE
HYDRODYNAMIC EQUATIONS

Following the basic idea of the RG method, we represent
the solution to equations (2.4) in the form of a standard
perturbation expansion [6] in a formal small parameter ǫ as

̺ = ̺0 +

Before proceeding with explicit calculations order by order,
we note that in all orders the perturbation equations acquire
the general form

where the functions αn(ξ; s) and βn(ξ; s) involve contri-
butions from previous orders and are considered known.
Eliminating vn and Ψn, it is possible to obtain a single
equation for ̺n alone, i.e.,

It is evident that in ﬁrst order α1 = β1 = 0. Imposing the
condition

dξ̺1(ξ; s) = 0,

(3.4)

which means that linear perturbation to the uniform sta-
tionary density ̺0 should average to zero and not affect the
normalization properties on the interval

we obtain the ﬁrst-order solution

have been introduced. Moreover, the discrete mode fre-

In third order, the functions α3 and β3 entering the right-

already determined quantities from the ﬁrst and second or-
ders, according to

It is important to note that the right-hand-side of equation
(3.3) for ̺3 contains terms which yield oscillating terms
with constant amplitudes to the solution for ̺3. Apart from
these, there is a resonant term (proportional to eiχm(ξ;s))
leading to a secular contribution. To complete the renor-
malization group reduction of the hydrodynamic equations,
we select this particular resonant third-order term on the

right-hand-side of equation (3.3). The latter can be written
as

ξ → X and s → S] on both sides of equation (3.24), we
obtain

where the dots stand for non-secular oscillating terms.
Moreover, the amplitude Pm(ξ; s) is secular and satisﬁes

We can now construct the perturbative solution for ̺ up
to third order in the small parameter ǫ. Conﬁning attention
to the constant stationary density ̺0 and the fundamental
modes (ﬁrst harmonic in the phase χm), we obtain

(3.23)
Following the basic philosophy of the RG method, we in-
troduce the intermediate coordinate X and “time” S and
transform equation (3.23) to

̺(ξ; s) = ̺0 + ǫ

{Am(X; S)

(cid:9)

(3.24)

Note that the transition from equation (3.23) to equation
(3.24) can always be performed by enforcing the constant
amplitude Am to be dependent on X and S, which is in
fact the procedure for renormalizing the standard perturba-
tion result. Since the general solution for ̺(ξ; s) should not
depend on X and S, by applying the operator
Lm(X; S)
[which is the same as that in equation (3.22) but with

b

Lm(X; S)Am(X; S) =

ΓmkAm(X; S)|Ak(X; S)|2,

b

(3.25)
where we have dropped the formal parameter ǫ on the right-
hand-side. Since the above equation should hold true for
any choice of X and S, we can set X = ξ and S = s.
Thus, we obtain the so-called proto RG equation [3, 4, 5]

Lm(ξ; s)Am(ξ; s) =

ΓmkAm(ξ; s)|Ak(ξ; s)|2.

4 THE NONLINEAR SCHROEDINGER
EQUATION FOR A SINGLE MODE

Equation (3.28) represents a system of coupled nonlinear
Schroedinger equations for the mode amplitudes. Neglect-
ing the contribution from modes with k 6= m, for a single
mode amplitude Am, we obtain the equation

It is easy to verify that Γm is always positive. In nonlinear
optics equation (4.1) is known to describe the formation
and evolution of the so-called dark solitons [7]. In the case
of charged particle beams these correspond to the forma-
tion of holes or cavitons in the beam. Since the renormal-
ized solution for the beam density ̺(ξ; s) can be expressed
as

̺(ξ; s) = ̺0 +

Am(ξ; s)eiχm(ξ;s).

(4.3)

Xm6=0

these holes have periodic structure in space ξ and “time” s.

5 CONCLUDING REMARKS

Based on the renormalization group method, a system of
coupled nonlinear Schroedinger equations has been derived
for the slowly varying amplitudes of interacting beam-
density waves. Under the approximation of an isolated

wave neglecting the effect of the rest of the waves, this sys-
tem reduces to a single nonlinear Schroedinger equation
with repulsive nonlinearity. The latter describes the for-
mation and evolution of holes in intense charged particle
beams.

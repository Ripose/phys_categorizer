Some general theorem was demonstrated by Panofsky and Wenzel [1] for
a beam of fast particles passing through a cavity parallel to its axis. The
transverse momentum p⊥ imparted to the particle (charge e) can be presented
as

p⊥ = e

∇⊥(Az) · dz,

(1)

d

0
Z

where z is the distance along the axis of the cavity, the ends of which
corresponds to z = 0, d and A is the vector potential. This equation was
derived for the special case of a cavity being some part of waveguide and
having no transit holes. However, in paper [2] eq.(1) was extended to the
common case, when cavity has an arbitrary shape and has transit holes.

For any TE-mode (no component of electric ﬁeld E parallel to the axis)
eq.(1) gives p⊥ = 0 . Here and throughout this paper the physical reason
of such a result is as follows: the actions of transverse electric and magnetic
ﬁelds cancel each other being integrated over trajectory. For a TM-mode
(no component of magnetic ﬁeld H parallel to the axis) the equation (1) was
presented in paper [1] as some integral of E⊥ only, independently of particle
velocity. However, this conclusion generally is in contradiction with Bell’s
paper [3] in which it was shown that TM-mode, excited in circular cavity
with round transit holes, gives p⊥ → 0 at vz → c. We will discuss below the
reason of such a discrepancy.

The latter result is of great importance for electron accelerators because it
inhibits, at ﬁrst sight, high-frequency (HF) focusing of electrons by accelerat-
ing ﬁeld. However, in our paper [4] the method of HF focusing was proposed
which consists in using not round but oval transit holes, may be slits, or in
using of noncircular cavities. In both cases the circular symmetry is broken
and in some direction the focusing by electric ﬁeld exceeds the magnetic ﬁeld
defocusing whereas in perpendicular direction one has the reverse situation.
This method was successfully used in classical microtron (see [4] and [5]) and
recently it was used for calculation of race-track microtron [6].

In all these papers only circular or rectangular cavities were considered.
Let us calculate the particle deﬂection in the common case with the only
restriction that a cavity has x = 0 and y = 0 planes of symmetry. In this case,
taking the cavity symmetry into consideration, we can write approximate
formulae

Ex = fxx, Ey = fyy, Hx = gxy, Hy = gyx, Hz = gzxy,

where x and y are small deviations of a particle trajectory from the cavity
axis, all coeﬃcients f and g are certain functions of z and an electromagnetic
ﬁeld inside the cavity can be written as Ecos(ωt + φ◦), Hsin(ωt + φ◦) with
a frequency ω and an arbitrary initial phase φ◦. Now one can obtain the
following relations, using one of the Maxwell equations:

We see that at β → 1, that usually takes place in electron accelerators, the
ﬁrst terms of the integrands in both equations vanish, the result depends only

The obtained result is interesting in some respects. First, one can see
that at any shape of cavity and transit holes HF focusing in some direction is
accompanied by defocusing in transverse direction the same as it takes place
for usual quadrupole focusing. Next, it follows from eqs.(6) that p⊥ = 0

2

for TM-mode at vz → c, the same as it follows from eq.(1) for TE-mode
at any velocity. Such a TM-mode may arise, for example, in a cavity of
cylindrical symmetry and this result corresponds to that of paper [3]. Such
mode may also be excited in rectangular cavity having such transit holes that
parameters G = α′ = α′′ which appear in eq.(4.13) of monograph [5]. It is
worth mentioning that ﬁrst of the relations (6) follows from eqs. (4.13) and
(4.14) of this monograph for the calculated there circular and rectangular
cavities.

This result, concerning TM-mode, obviously is in contradiction with the
formula (7) of paper [1], in which p⊥ 6= 0 at any velocity. Such a discrep-
ancy arises not only due to diﬀerent boundary conditions. The mentioned
formula (7) is incorrect because it was derived from the correct equation (3)
of paper [1], which corresponds to eq.(1) of this paper, under the assumption
∇⊥(Az) ∝ E⊥ (see eq.(4) in paper [1]), which is valid only for a waveguide,
not for a cavity. In any cavity mode the mentioned values are displaced in
time by quarter of a period. At the same time eq.(6) is agreed upon the
equation (1) ﬁrst obtained by Panofsky and Wenzel [1].

Here the equations (6) were derived for a cavity of an arbitrary shape hav-
ing two planes of symmetry. In this common case TM-modes also can exist
if the cavity is extended in some of these planes as much that it corresponds
to transit holes asymmetry. If there is no such an accordance then magnetic
lines penetrate into holes from the cavity and week component Hz arises.
However, despite low level of this component and the fact that Lorentz force
does not depend on Hz, the resulting focusing at β → 1 is proportional to
Hz as it follows from eq.(6). So, it follows from paper [1] together with this
paper, that high-energy electrons can be deﬂected or focused only by such
HF ﬁelds that have all six components and, hence, they are nor TE- nor
TM-modes.

The relations (6) are of practical importance for the numerical calculation
of HF focusing. Such calculation is hampered by the fact that great focusing
and defocusing impulses, produced by quasi-static electric ﬁeld near transit
holes and by HF magnetic ﬁeld inside the cavity, are subtracted from each
other and ﬁnal value is little compared to initial ones. For this reason one
needs to know the ﬁeld distribution with very high accuracy that is conjec-
tural. Taking this into account, the equations (6) can be used to check a
result of numerical calculations.

Abstract

corresponding Hamiltonian is ([13] for designation):

We present the applications of methods from nonlinear
local harmonic analysis in variational framework to cal-
culations of nonlinear motions in polynomial/rational ap-
proximations (up to any order) of arbitrary n-pole ﬁelds.
Our approach is based on the methods provided possibil-
ity to work with dynamical beam/particle localization in
phase space, which gives representions via exact nonlinear
high-localized eigenmodes expansions and allows to con-
trol contribution to motion from each scale of underlying
multiscale structure.

INTRODUCTION

In this paper we consider the applications of a new nu-
merical-analytical technique based on the methods of local
nonlinear harmonic analysis or wavelet analysis to the cal-
culations of orbital motions in arbitrary n-pole ﬁelds. Our
main examples are motion in transverse plane for a sin-
gle particle in a circular magnetic lattice in case when we
take into account multipolar expansion up to an arbitrary
ﬁnite number and particle motion in storage rings. We re-
duce initial dynamical problem to the ﬁnite number of stan-
dard algebraical problems and represent all dynamical vari-
ables as expansion in the bases of maximally localized in
phase space functions. Our approach in this paper is based
on the generalization of variational-wavelet approach from
[1]-[12]. Starting in part 2 from Hamiltonians of orbital
motion in magnetic lattice with additional kicks terms and
rational approximation of classical motion in storage rings,
we consider in part 3 variational-biorthogonal formulation
for dynamical system with rational nonlinearities and con-
struct explicit representation for all dynamical variables as
expansions in nonlinear high-localized eigenmodes.

Then we may take into account an arbitrary but ﬁnite num-
ber of terms in expansion of RHS of Hamiltonian (2) and
from our point of view the corresponding Hamiltonian
equations of motions are not more than nonlinear ordinary
differential equations with polynomial nonlinearities and
variable coefﬁcients. Also we may add the terms corre-
sponding to kick type contributions of rf-cavity:

sical dynamics in storage rings and using Serret–Frenet

3 VARIATIONAL APPROACH IN
BIORTHOGONAL WAVELET BASES

The ﬁrst main part of our consideration is some vari-
ational approach to these problems, which reduce initial
problem to the problem of solution of functional equations
at the ﬁrst stage and some algebraical problems at the sec-
ond stage. Multiresolution expansion is the second main
part of our construction. As a result the solution is param-
eterized by solutions of two reduced algebraical problems,
one is nonlinear and others are linear problems obtained
from wavelet constructions and represented as expansion
in a compactly supported wavelet basis. Because inte-
grand of variational functionals is represented by bilinear
form (scalar product) it seems more reasonable to consider
wavelet constructions which take into account all advan-
tages of this structure. Let (M, ω) be a symplectic man-
ifold, H is Hamiltonian, XH is unique Hamiltonian vec-
tor ﬁeld deﬁned by ω(XH(x), υ) = −dH(x)(υ),
υ ∈
x ∈ M, where ω is the symplectic structure. T-
TxM,
periodic solution x(t) of the Hamiltonian equations ˙x =
XH (x) on M is a solution, satisfying the boundary condi-
tions x(T ) = x(0), T > 0. Let us deﬁne a function

Φ(x) =

< −J ˙x, x > dt −

H(x(t))dt

(5)

T

The critical points of Φ are the periodic solutions of ˙x =
XH (x). Computing the derivative at x ∈ Ω in the direction
of y ∈ Ω, we ﬁnd

Φ′(x)(y) =

Φ(x + ǫy)|ǫ=0

(6)

d

< −J ˙x − ▽H(x), y > dt

Consequently, Φ′(x)(y) = 0 for all y ∈ Ω iff the loop x
satisﬁes the equation

− J ˙x(t) − ▽H(x(t)) = 0

(7)

Now we introduce wavelets in our underlying bilinear
structure. Let us consider action of operator S on x

S(ω(J), H, x, ∂/∂t, ∇, t)x = −J ˙x(t) − ▽H(x(t)) (8)

which is polynomial/rational in x, and have arbitrary de-
pendence on t. Then (6) is equivalent to

< Sx, y > dt = 0

(9)

Z

We start with two hierarchical sequences of approximations
spaces [14]:

. . . V−2 ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V2 . . . ,

and corresponding biorthogonal expansions:

Let W0 be complement to V0 in V1, but not necessarily
orthogonal complement. Orthogonality conditions have the
Wj,
W0 ⊥ V0, W0 ⊥
following form:
Vj ⊥
Wj . Translates of ψ span W0, translates of ˜ψ span
W0.

Biorthogonality conditions are

(12)
where ψjk(x) = 2j/2ψ(2jx−k). Functions ϕ(x), ˜ϕ(x−k)
form dual pair: < ϕ(x − k), ˜ϕ(x − ℓ) >= δkl, < ϕ(x −
k), ˜ψ(x − ℓ) >= 0. Functions ϕ, ˜ϕ generate a multiresolu-
tion analysis. ϕ(x − k), ψ(x − k) are synthesis functions,
˜ϕ(x − ℓ), ˜ψ(x − ℓ) are analysis functions. Synthesis func-
tions are biorthogonal to analysis functions. Scaling spaces
are orthogonal to dual wavelet spaces. Two multiresolu-
tions are intertwining Vj +Wj = Vj+1,
Vj+1.
These are direct sums but not orthogonal sums. So, our
representation (11) for solution on the level of resolution
Vj has now the form

Wj =

Vj +

f

e

e

xj(t) =

˜ajkψjk(t),

(13)

where synthesis wavelets are used to synthesize the func-
tion. But ˜ajk come from inner products with analysis
wavelets. Biorthogonality yields

˜ajm =

xj (t) ˜ψjm(t)dt.

Z

(14)

So, we may use this more useful construction in our vari-
ational approach [1]-[12]. We have modiﬁcation only on
the level of computing coefﬁcients of reduced nonlinear al-
gebraical system of equations. This biorthogonal construc-
tion is more ﬂexible and stable under the action of large
class of operators while orthogonal (one scale for multires-
olution) is fragile, all computations are much more simpler
and we accelerate the rate of convergence. In all types of
Hamiltonian calculation, which are based on some bilin-
ear structures (symplectic or Poissonian structures, bilinear
form of integrand in variational integral) this framework
leads to greater success. In numerical modelling we may
consider very useful wavelet packets. As a result we have
from (9) the following reduced system of algebraical equa-
tions (RSAE) on the set of unknown coefﬁcients ai of ex-
pansions (11):

L(Sij, a, αI , βJ ) = 0

(15)

where operator L is algebraization of initial problem (8).
I = (i1, ..., iq+2), J = (j1, ..., jp+1) are multiindexes,
by which are labelled αI and βI , the other coefﬁcients of
RSAE (15):

βJ = {βj1...jp+1} =

ϕjk ,

(16)

Z Y1≤jk≤p+1

xN (t) =

arψr(t),

yN (t) =

bk ˜ψk(t)

(11)

αI = {αi1 ...αiq+2 } =

ϕi1 ... ˙ϕis ...ϕiq+2 ,

Xi1,...,iq+2

Z

N

Xk=1

where p (q) is the degree of nominator (denominator) part
˙ϕis = dϕis /dt. Now,
of operator S (8), iℓ = (1, ..., q + 2),
when we solve RSAE (15) and determine unknown coefﬁ-
cients from formal expansion (11) we therefore obtain the
solution of our initial problem. It should be noted that if
we consider only truncated expansion with N terms then
we have from (15) the system of N × n (n is dimension
of x (7)) algebraical equations and the degree of this alge-
braical system coincides with degree of initial differential
system. The problem of computations of coefﬁcients αI ,
βJ (16) of reduced algebraical system may be explicitly
solved in wavelet approach. The bases functions ψk(t) (11)
are obtained via multiresolution expansions (10) and repre-
sented by compactly supported wavelets. Because afﬁne
group of translations and dilations is inside the approach,
this method resembles the action of a microscope. We have
contribution to ﬁnal result from each scale of resolution
from the whole inﬁnite scale of spaces (10). The solution
has the following form

we present sections x − px corresponding to model (5) in
different parameter regions.

part zslow
and fast oscillating parts for arbitrary N. So, we
may move from coarse scales of resolution to the ﬁnest one
for obtaining more detailed information about our dynam-
ical process. The ﬁrst term in the RHS of equation (19)
corresponds on the global level of function space decom-
position to resolution space and the second one to detail
space. In this way we give contribution to our full solution
from each scale of resolution or each time scale. On Fig. 1

NONLINEAR ACCELERATOR PROBLEMS VIA WAVELETS:
6. REPRESENTATIONS AND QUASICLASSICS VIA FWT

A. Fedorova, M. Zeitlin, IPME, RAS, St. Petersburg, Russia ∗ †

Abstract

In this series of eight papers we present the applications of
methods from wavelet analysis to polynomial approxima-
tions for a number of accelerator physics problems. In this
part we consider application of FWT to metaplectic repre-
sentation(quantum and chaotical problems) and quasiclas-
sics.

INTRODUCTION

This is the sixth part of our eight presentations in which
we consider applications of methods from wavelet anal-
ysis to nonlinear accelerator physics problems. This is a
continuation of our results from [1]-[8], in which we con-
sidered the applications of a number of analytical methods
from nonlinear (local) Fourier analysis, or wavelet analy-
sis, to nonlinear accelerator physics problems both general
and with additional structures (Hamiltonian, symplectic or
quasicomplex), chaotic, quasiclassical, quantum. Wavelet
analysis is a relatively novel set of mathematical methods,
which gives us a possibility to work with well-localized
bases in functional spaces and with the general type of
operators (differential, integral, pseudodifferential) in such
In contrast with parts 1–4 in parts 5–8 we try to
bases.
take into account before using power analytical approaches
underlying algebraical, geometrical, topological structures
related to kinematical, dynamical and hidden symmetry of
physical problems. In part 2 according to the orbit method
and by using construction from the geometric quantization
theory we construct the symplectic and Poisson structures
associated with generalized wavelets by using metaplectic
structure. In part 3 we consider applications of very useful
fast wavelet transform technique (FWT) (part 4) to calcu-
lations in quasiclassical evolution dynamics. This method
gives maximally sparse representation of (differential) op-
erator that allows us to take into account contribution from
each level of resolution.

2 METAPLECTIC GROUP AND

REPRESENTATIONS

Let Sp(n) be symplectic group, M p(n) be its unique two-
fold covering – metaplectic group [9]. Let V be a sym-

plectic vector space with symplectic form ( , ), then R ⊕ V
is nilpotent Lie algebra - Heisenberg algebra:
[R, V ] =
0, [v, w] = (v, w) ∈ R, [V, V ] = R. Sp(V ) is a group
of automorphisms of Heisenberg algebra. Let N be a group
with Lie algebra R ⊕ V , i.e. Heisenberg group. By Stone–
von Neumann theorem Heisenberg group has unique irre-
ducible unitary representation in which 1 7→ i. Let us also
consider the projective representation of symplectic group
Sp(V ): Ug1 Ug2 = c(g1, g2) · Ug1g2 , where c is a map:
Sp(V ) × Sp(V ) → S1, i.e. c is S1-cocycle. But this rep-
resentation is unitary representation of universal covering,
i.e. metaplectic group M p(V ). We give this representa-
tion without Stone-von Neumann theorem. Consider a new
group F = N ′ ⊲⊳ M p(V ),
⊲⊳ is semidirect product (we
consider instead of N = R ⊕ V the N ′ = S1 × V, S1 =
(R/2πZ)). Let V ∗ be dual to V, G(V ∗) be automorphism
group of V ∗.Then F is subgroup of G(V ∗), which consists
of elements, which acts on V ∗ by afﬁne transformations.
This is the key point! Let q1, ..., qn; p1, ..., pn be symplec-
pidqi and dα be symplectic
tic basis in V, α = pdq =
form on V ∗. Let M be ﬁxed afﬁne polarization, then for
P
a ∈ F the map a 7→ Θa gives unitary representation of G:
Θa : H(M ) → H(M ). Explicitly we have for representa-
tion of N on H(M): (Θqf )∗(x) = e−iqxf (x), Θpf (x) =
f (x − p) The representation of N on H(M) is irreducible.
Let Aq, Ap be inﬁnitesimal operators of this representation

Aq = lim

[Θ−tq − I], Ap = lim

then Aqf (x) = i(qx)f (x), Apf (x) =

X

Now we give the representation of inﬁnitesimal basic ele-
ments. Lie algebra of the group F is the algebra of all (non-
homogeneous) quadratic polynomials of (p,q) relatively
Poisson bracket (PB). The basis of this algebra consists of
elements 1, q1, ..., qn, p1, ..., pn, qiqj, qipj, pipj,
i, j =
1, ..., n,

i ≤ j,

P B is {f, g} =

and {1, g} = 0 f or all g,
{pi, qj} = δij,
{piqj, pk} = −δjkpi,
{pipj, qk} = δikpj + δjkpi,
{qiqj, pk} = −δikqj − δjkqi

{piqj, qk} = δikqj,

{pipj, pk} = 0,

{qiqj, qk} = 0,

so, we have the representation of basic elements f 7→ Af :
1 7→ i, qk 7→ ixk,

where α = (α1, . . . , αn) is a multi-index, |α| = α1 + . . . +
αn, Dx = −i¯h∂x. So, evolution (1) for symbol bt(x, ξ; ¯h)
is

This gives the structure of the Poisson manifolds to rep-
resentation of any (nilpotent) algebra or in other words to
continuous wavelet transform. According to this approach
we can construct by using methods of geometric quantiza-
tion theory many ”symplectic wavelet constructions” with
corresponding symplectic or Poisson structure on it. Then
we may produce symplectic invariant wavelet calculations
for PB or commutators which we may use in quantization
procedure or in chaotic dynamics (part 8) via operator rep-
resentation from section 4.

3 QUASICLASSICAL EVOLUTION

Let us consider classical and quantum dynamics in phase
space Ω = R2m with coordinates (x, ξ) and generated by
Hamiltonian H(x, ξ) ∈ C∞(Ω; R). If ΦH
: Ω −→ Ω is
t
(classical) ﬂow then time evolution of any bounded clas-
sical observable or symbol b(x, ξ) ∈ C∞(Ω, R) is given
by bt(x, ξ) = b(ΦH
t (x, ξ)). Let H = OpW (H) and
B = OpW (b) are the self-adjoint operators or quantum
observables in L2(Rn), representing the Weyl quantization
of the symbols H, b [9]

where u ∈ S(Rn) and Bt = eiHt/¯hBe−iHt/¯h be the
Heisenberg observable or quantum evolution of the observ-
able B under unitary group generated by H. Bt solves
the Heisenberg equation of motion ˙Bt = (i/¯h)[H, Bt]. Let
bt(x, ξ; ¯h) is a symbol of Bt then we have the following
equation for it

˙bt = {H, bt}M ,
with the initial condition b0(x, ξ, ¯h) = b(x, ξ). Here
{f, g}M (x, ξ) is the Moyal brackets of the observables
f, g ∈ C∞(R2n), {f, g}M (x, ξ) = f ♯g − g♯f , where f ♯g
is the symbol of the operator product and is presented by
the composition of the symbols f, g

For our problems it is useful that {f, g}M admits the formal

At ¯h = 0 this equation transforms to classical Liouville

˙bt = {H, bt}.
Equation (2) plays a key role in many quantum (semiclas-
sical) problem. We note only the problem of relation be-
tween quantum and classical evolutions or how long the
evolution of the quantum observables is determined by the
corresponding classical one [9]. Our approach to solution
of systems (2), (3) is based on our technique from [1]-[8]
and very useful linear parametrization for differential oper-
ators which we present in the next section.

4 FAST WAVELET TRANSFORM FOR

DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS

P

Let us consider multiresolution representation . . . ⊂ V2 ⊂
V1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V−2 . . . (see our other papers from
this series for details of wavelet machinery). Let T be an
operator T : L2(R) → L2(R), with the kernel K(x, y)
: L2(R) → Vj (j ∈ Z) is projection opera-
and Pj
tors on the subspace Vj corresponding to j level of res-
olution: (Pjf )(x) =
k < f, ϕj,k > ϕj,k(x). Let
Qj = Pj−1 − Pj is the projection operator on the sub-
space Wj then we have the following ”microscopic or tele-
scopic” representation of operator T which takes into ac-
count contributions from each level of resolution from dif-
ferent scales starting with coarsest and ending to ﬁnest
j∈Z (QjT Qj + QjT Pj + PjT Qj). We
scales [10]: T =
remember that this is a result of presence of afﬁne group in-
side this construction. The non-standard form of operator
representation [10] is a representation of an operator T as
a chain of triples T = {Aj, Bj, Γj}j∈Z, acting on the sub-
spaces Vj and Wj: Aj : Wj → Wj, Bj : Vj → Wj, Γj :
Wj → Vj, where operators {Aj, Bj, Γj}j∈Z are deﬁned
as Aj = QjT Qj, Bj = QjT Pj, Γj = PjT Qj. The
operator T admits a recursive deﬁnition via

Tj =

Aj+1 Bj+1

,

(cid:18)
: Vj → Vj.
where Tj = PjT Pj and Tj works on Vj
It should be noted that operator Aj describes interaction
on the scale j independently from other scales, opera-
tors Bj, Γj describe interaction between the scale j and all
coarser scales, the operator Tj is an ”averaged” version of
Tj−1. The operators Aj , Bj, Γj, Tj are represented by ma-
trices αj, βj , γj, sj

We may compute the non-standard representations of oper-
ator d/dx in the wavelet bases by solving a small system
of linear algebraical equations. So, we have for objects (4)

space V0. The coefﬁcients rℓ, ℓ ∈ Z satisfy the following

ℓ ≤ L − 2, rℓ = −r−ℓ. For the representation of op-
erator dn/dxn we have the similar reduced linear system
of equations. Then ﬁnally we have for action of operator

where ϕj,k(x) = 2−j/2ϕ(2−jx − k) is wavelet basis and

fj,k−1 = 2−j/2

f (x)ϕ(2−j x − k + ℓ)dx

are wavelet coefﬁcients. So, we have simple linear para-
metrization of matrix representation of our differential op-
erator in wavelet basis and of the action of this operator on
arbitrary vector in our functional space. Then we may use
such representation in all preceding sections.

We are very grateful to M. Cornacchia (SLAC), W. Her-
rmannsfeldt (SLAC) Mrs. J. Kono (LBL) and M. Laraneta
(UCLA) for their permanent encouragement.

Abstract

Inﬂuence of a linear energy chirp in the electron beam on a SASE FEL operation is studied

analytically and numerically using 1-D model. Explicit expressions for Green’s functions and for

output power of a SASE FEL are obtained for high-gain linear regime in the limits of small and

large energy chirp parameter. Saturation length and power versus energy chirp parameter are

calculated numerically. It is shown that the eﬀect of linear energy chirp on FEL gain is equivalent

to the linear undulator tapering (or linear energy variation along the undulator). A consequence of

this fact is a possibility to perfectly compensate FEL gain degradation, caused by the energy chirp,

by means of the undulator tapering independently of the value of the energy chirp parameter. An

application of this eﬀect for generation of attosecond pulses from a hard X-ray FEL is proposed.

Strong energy modulation within a short slice of an electron bunch is produced by few-cycle optical

laser pulse in a short undulator, placed in front of the main undulator. Gain degradation within

this slice is compensated by an appropriate undulator taper while the rest of the bunch suﬀers from

this taper and does not lase. Three-dimensional simulations predict that short (200 attoseconds)

high-power (up to 100 GW) pulses can be produced in Angstroem wavelength range with a high

degree of contrast. A possibility to reduce pulse duration to sub-100 attosecond scale is discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Start-to-end simulations [1] of the TESLA Test Facility Free Electron Laser (TTF FEL),

Phase 1 [2], have shown a presence of a strong energy chirp (energy-time correlation) within

a short high-current leading peak in electron density distribution that has driven Self-

Ampliﬁed Spontaneous Emission (SASE) FEL process. The energy chirp was accumulated

due to the longitudinal space charge after compression. According to the simulations (that

reproduced well the measured FEL properties), the energy chirp had a dramatical impact on

SASE FEL saturation length and output characteristics. A similar eﬀect takes place during

the operation of VUV FEL at DESY in a ”femtosecond mode” [3, 4, 5]. Such a mode of

operation might also be possible in future X-ray SASE FELs.

There also exists a concept of frequency-chirped SASE FELs (frequency chirp of SASE

FEL radiation is correlated with energy chirp in the electron beam due to the FEL resonance

condition) aiming at the shortening of radiation pulse with the help of a monochromator

[6]. Energy chirp can also be used to tune the output frequency of an FEL with coherent

prebunching as it was demonstrated in the experiment at the DUV FEL facility [7]. Thus,

a theoretical understanding of the energy chirp eﬀect on the FEL performance is of crucial

importance.

Analytical studies on this subject were performed in [8]

in the framework of one-

dimensional approximation. The general form of a time-domain Green’s function as an

inverse Laplace transform was derived in [8]. It was then reduced to the explicit expression

in the limit of small energy chirp parameter up to the ﬁrst order, resulting in phase correc-

tion (and ignoring the gain correction). This explicit solution for the Green’s function was

used to analyze statistical properties of a chirped SASE FEL in this limit. A second order

correction to the FEL gain was presented in [6] but this result is incorrect.

In this paper we study the impact of energy chirp on SASE FEL performance. We also

ﬁnd that FEL gain degradation can be perfectly compensated by undulator tapering. We

discuss an application of the compensation eﬀect for generation of attosecond pulses from

X-ray FELs such as European XFEL [9] and Linac Coherent Light Source [10].

II. GREEN’S FUNCTION

Let us consider a planar undulator with the magnetic ﬁeld

Hz(z) = Hw cos(2πz/λw) ,

where λw is undulator period, and Hw is peak magnetic ﬁeld. Electric ﬁeld of the ampliﬁed

electromagnetic wave is presented in the form:

E = ˜E exp[iω0(z/c

t)] + C.C. ,

−

where ω0 is a reference frequency and ˜E is slowly-varying amplitude [11]. As it was shown in
[8], for a SASE FEL, driven by an electron beam with linear energy chirp, ˜E can be written

as follows (we use notations from [11]):

˜E = 2E0

IV. NONLINEAR REGIME

We studied nonlinear regime of a chirped SASE FEL operation with 1-D version of the

code FAST [11, 14]. Analytical results, presented above, were used as a primary standard

for testing the code in linear regime. Green’s function was modelled by exciting density

modulation on a short scale, ∆ˆs

1. SASE FEL initial conditions were simulated in a

≪

standard way [11]. The results of numerical simulations in all cases were in a good agreement

with analytical results presented in two previous Sections.

13.

The main results of the simulations of the nonlinear regime are presented in Figs. 1 and 2.

Saturation length and power are functions of two parameters, ˆα and Nc. For our simulations

we have chosen Nc = 3

107 - a typical value for VUV SASE FELs. Note, however, that

×

the results, presented in Figs. 1 and 2, very weakly depend on Nc. Fig. 1 shows increase of

saturation length with respect to unchirped beam case. In Fig. 2 the output power is plotted

versus chirp parameter for two cases: when undulator length is equal to a saturation length

for a given ˆα and when it is equal to the saturation length for the unchirped beam case.

One can see sharp reduction of power for negative ˆα while a mild positive chirp ( ˆα < 0.5) is

beneﬁcial for SASE.

V. ENERGY CHIRP AND UNDULATOR TAPERING

Let us consider now the case when there is no energy chirp ( ˆα = 0) and the detuning
parameter changes linearly along the undulator [11]: ˆC(ˆz) = ˆb1 ˆz. This change can be

due to variation of undulator parameters (K(ˆz) and/or kw(ˆz)), or due to an energy change

γ0(ˆz). We have found from numerical simulations that in such case the eﬀect on FEL gain
is exactly the same as in the case of energy chirp and no taper if ˆα = 2ˆb1 for any value

of ˆα (Figure 3 shows an example). Therefore, all the results of two previous Sections can

be also used for the case of linear variation of energy or undulator parameters with the
2ˆb1. The amplitudes of Green’s functions are also the same while the

substitution ˆα
phases are obviously diﬀerent. In case of ˆb1 = 0, ˆα

An eﬀect of undulator tapering (or energy change along the undulator) on FEL gain was
2ˆb1)

studied in [13] in the limit ˆb1 ≪
and Eq. (45) of Ref. [13], we can see that quadratic correction term in the argument of the

1. Comparing our Eq. (13) (with the substitution ˆα

→

exponential function is the same but the linear term is two times larger in [13]. The reason

for discrepancy is that the frequency dependence of the pre-exponential factor in Eq. (42)

of Ref. [13] is neglected.

A symmetry between two considered eﬀects (energy chirp and undulator tapering) can be

understood as follows. If we look at the radiation ﬁeld acting on some test electron from an

electron behind it, this ﬁeld was emitted at a retarded time. In the ﬁrst case a back electron

has a detuning due to an energy oﬀset, in the second case it has the same detuning because

undulator parameters were diﬀerent at a retarded time. The question arises: can these two

eﬀects compensate each other? We give a positive answer based on numerical simulations
(see Fig. 3 as an example): by setting ˆb1 =

ˆα/2 we get rid of gain degradation, and FEL

−
power at any point along the undulator is the same as in the case of unchirped beam and

untapered undulator. This holds for any value of ˆα. For instance, if one linearly changes

magnetic ﬁeld Hw of the undulator, the compensation condition can be written as follows

(nominal values of parameters are marked with subscript ’0’):

Of course, in such a case we get frequency chirped SASE pulse. Since compensation of gain

degradation is possible also for large values of ˆα (there is no theoretical limit on the value

of chirp parameter, except for above mentioned condition ρˆα

1), one can, in principle,

≪

organize a regime when a frequency chirp within an intensity spike is much larger than the

natural FEL bandwidth (given by ρω0).

200 attosecond pulse duration.

VI. GENERATION OF ATTOSECOND PULSES

Up to now several schemes for generation of attosecond pulses from X-ray SASE FELs

have been proposed [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. Here we mention the schemes considered in [17,

18] making use of energy modulation of a short slice in the electron bunch by a high-power

few-cycle optical pulse in a two-period undulator. Due to energy modulation the frequency

of SASE radiation in X-ray undulator is correlated to the longitudinal position within the

few-cycle-driven slice of the electron beam. The largest frequency oﬀset corresponds to a

single-spike pulse in time domain (about 300 attoseconds). The selection of single-spike

pulses is achieved by using a crystal monochromator after the X-ray undulator [17], or with

the help of the other undulator tuned to the oﬀset frequency [18].

In this paper we propose a new scheme (see Fig. 4) that makes use of the compensation

eﬀect, described in the previous Section. Indeed, there is a strong energy chirp around zero-

crossing of energy modulation. If one uses appropriate undulator taper then only a short

slice around zero-crossing produces powerful FEL pulse. The main part of the bunch is

unmodulated and suﬀers from strong negative undulator tapering (see Fig. 2). One should

also note that for large negative taper the SASE FEL gain is very sensitive to longitudinal

velocity spread. Therefore, a high-contrast attosecond pulse is directly produced in the

undulator.

FIG. 5: Possible evolutions of the electric ﬁeld in the 5-fs pulse. carried at a wavelength 800 nm

for two diﬀerent pulse phases (φ = 0, π/2)

Operation of attosecond SASE FEL is illustrated for the parameters close to those of the

European XFEL operating at the wavelength 0.15 nm [9]. The parameters of the electron

beam are: energy 15 GeV, charge 1 nC, rms pulse length 25 µm, rms normalized emittance

1.4 mm-mrad, rms energy spread 1 MeV. Undulator period is 3.65 cm.

The parameters of the seed laser are: wavelength 800 nm, energy in the laser pulse 3 mJ,

and FWHM pulse duration 5 fs (see Fig. 5). The laser beam is focused onto the electron

beam in a short undulator resonant at the optical wavelength of 800 nm. Optimal conditions

of the focusing correspond to the positioning of the laser beam waist in the center of the

modulator undulator. It is assumed that the phase of laser ﬁeld corresponds to ”sine” mode

(dashed line with ϕ = π/2, see Fig. 5). Parameters of the modulator undulator are: period

length 50 cm, peak ﬁeld 1.6 T, number of periods 2. The interaction with the laser light

in the undulator produces a time-dependent electron energy modulation as it is shown in

Fig. 6. This modulation corresponds to the energy chirp parameter ˆα

2 at zero crossing

≃

(t = 5 fs in Fig. 6).

Optimization of the attosecond SASE FEL has been performed with the three-

dimensional, time dependent code FAST [14] taking into account all physical eﬀects in-

ﬂuencing the SASE FEL operation (diﬀraction eﬀects, energy spread, emittance, slippage

eﬀect, etc.). Three-dimensional simulations conﬁrmed the predictions of the one-dimensional

model: the energy chirp and the undulator tapering compensate each other, there is strong

suppression of the ampliﬁcation in the case of uncompensated negative taper.

Undulator tapering is performed by changing the gap of undulator modules [9] such that
magnetic ﬁeld increases linearly along the undulator length (ˆb1 < 0). We performed the
scan of tapering depth ˆb1 in order to maximize the power in the main peak on one hand,

and to minimize contribution of the background, on the other hand. We ended up with the

value of taper which is about 20 % smaller than that required for a perfect compensation of

chirp at t = 5 fs. Note that the chirp is not linear in the region of interest. In addition, a

mild net positive chirp is beneﬁcial for SASE, as it was discussed above (see Fig. 2).

A typical radiation pulse at the undulator length 100 m is shown in Fig. 6. One can see

a high-power spike in the region where the energy chirp is well compensated by the taper

and two weak side peaks at t

2 fs and t

8 fs where the net eﬀect is negative taper. In

the rest of the bunch a large negative taper together with velocity spread and 3-D eﬀects

completely suppresses ampliﬁcation. In Fig. 7 we present three diﬀerent shots illustrating

the properties of the main peak. Typical pulse duration is about 200 attoseconds (FWHM)

and peak power ranges from several tens up to hundred GW. To estimate the contrast

(which we deﬁne as the ratio of energy in the main peak to the total radiated energy at the

experiment) we assume that an angular collimation is used in order to reduce spontaneous

emission background. A collimator with half-angle 3 µrad allows the entire intensity in the

main peak to be transmitted. The contrast is inﬂuenced by SASE intensity in two side

peaks and by spontaneous emission in the ﬁrst harmonic from the rest of the bunch. For the

charge of 1 nC, as in our numerical example, the contrast is about 95 %. Higher harmonics of

undulator radiation (if they disturb an experiment) can be cut, for instance, by a multilayer

monochromator with a bandwidth of the order of 1 %.

VII. BEYOND ”FUNDAMENTAL LIMIT”

It is generally accepted that the shortest pulse, that can be obtained from a SASE FEL,

is given by a duration of intensity spike in time domain, i.e.
it is deﬁned by inverse FEL
bandwidth (ρω0)−1. However, the fact that a SASE FEL can operate with a strong chirp

parameter (in combination with undulator tapering) without gain degradation, opens up a

13

possibility of a conceptual breakthrough: one can get from SASE FEL a radiation pulse

which is much shorter than the inverse FEL bandwidth.

Indeed, in the case of ˆα

1,

≫

the frequency chirp inside an intensity spike is much larger than FEL bandwidth. Thus,

one can use a monochromator to reduce pulse duration. By an appropriate choice of the

monochromator bandwidth one can select an X-ray pulse that is shorter by a factor of

√2 ˆα than the inverse FEL bandwidth. The only theoretical limit in this case is given by

1. Note that for hard X-ray FELs the parameter ρ is in the range

the condition ρˆα
10−3.
10−4

≪

−

To illustrate a possible technical realization of this idea, we can suppose that the energy

modulation by a few-cycle optical pulse is increased by a factor 3 so that ˆα

6.

In

combination with undulator tapering and a monochromator, this would allow to obtain sub-

100-GW coherent X-ray pulses with a duration below 100 attoseconds and a contrast about

80-90 %.

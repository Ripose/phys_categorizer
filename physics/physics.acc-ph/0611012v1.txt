The feasibility to generate powerful monochromatic radiation of the undulator type in the gamma
region of the spectrum by means of planar channeling of ultra-relativistic electrons in a periodically
bent crystal is proven.
It is shown that an electron-based crystalline undulator operates in the
regime of higher beam energies than a positron-based one does. A numerical analysis is performed
for a 50 GeV electron channeling in Si along the (111) crystallographic planes.

In this Letter we demonstrate, for the ﬁrst time, that
it is possible to construct a powerful source of high en-
ergy photons by means of planar channeling of ultra-
relativistic electrons through a periodically bent crystal.
For a positron channeling the feasibility of such a device
was demonstrated in Ref. [1].

A periodically bent crystal together with a bunch of
ultra-relativistic charged particles which undergo planar
channeling constitute a crystalline undulator.
In such
a system there appears, in addition to the well-known
channeling radiation, the undulator type radiation which
is due to the periodic motion of channeling particles
which follow the bending of the crystallographic planes
[1]. The intensity and characteristic frequencies of this
radiation can be varied by changing the beam energy and
the parameters of the bending.
In the cited papers as
well as in subsequent publications (see the review [2] and
the references therein) we proved a feasibility to create
a short-wave crystalline undulator that will emit high-
intensity, highly monochromatic radiation when pulses
of ultra-relativistic positrons are passed through its chan-
nels. More recently it was demonstrated [3] that the bril-
liance of radiation from a positron-based undulator in the
energy range from hundreds of keV up to tens of MeV is
comparable to that of conventional light sources of the
third generation operating for much lower photon ener-
gies. Experimental study of this phenomenon is on the
way within the framework of the PECU project [4].

The mechanism of the photon emission in a crystalline
undulator is illustrated by Fig. 1. Provided certain con-
ditions are met, the particles, injected into the crystal,
will undergo channeling in the periodically bent channel
[1]. The trajectory of a particle contains two elements.
Firstly, there are channeling oscillations due to the action
of the interplanar potential [5]. Their typical frequency
Ωch depends on the projectile energy ε and parameters
of the potential. Secondly, there are oscillations because
of the periodicity of the bendings, the undulator oscilla-
tions, whose frequency is ω0 ≈ 2πc/λ (c is the velocity of
light). The spontaneous emission is associated with both
of these oscillations. The typical frequency of the chan-
neling radiation is ωch ≈ 2γ2Ωch [6], where γ = ε/mc2.

Circles denote the atoms belonging to neighboring crystallo-
graphic planes (separated by the distance d) which are pe-
riodically bent. The wavy lines represent the trajectories of
channeling particles. A positron (dashed curve) channels in
between two planes, whereas the electron channeling (chained
curve) occurs nearby the crystallographic plane. The proﬁle
of periodic bending is given by y(z) = a sin(2πz/λ), where the
period λ and amplitude a satisfy the condition λ ≫ a > d.

The undulator oscillations give rise to photons with fre-
quency ω ≈ 4γ2ω0/(2 + p2), where p = 2πγa/λ is the
If ω0 ≪ Ωch, then the frequen-
undulator parameter.
cies of channeling and undulator radiation are also well
separated. In this limit the characteristics of undulator
radiation are practically independent on the channeling
oscillations [1], and the operational principle of a crys-
talline undulator is the same as for a conventional one
[7] in which the monochromaticity of radiation is the re-
sult of constructive interference of the photons emitted
from similar parts of the trajectory.

The necessary conditions, which must be met in order
to treat a crystalline undulator as a feasible scheme for
devising a new source of electromagnetic radiation, are
as follows [1]:

maxλ2 < 1 - stable channeling,

C = 4π2εa/U ′
d < a ≪ λ
- large-amplitude regime,
N = L/λ ≫ 1
- large number of periods,
L ∼ minhLd(C), La(ω)i - account for dechanneling
and photon attenuation,

(1)

∆ε/ε ≪ 1

- low radiative losses.

Below we present a short description of the physics lying
behind these conditions.

A stable channeling of a projectile in a periodically
bent channel occurs if the maximum centrifugal force Fcf
is less than the maximal interplanar force U ′
max, i.e. C =
Fcf /U ′
max < 1. Expressing Fcf through the energy ε of
the projectile, the period and amplitude of the bending
one formulates this condition as it is written in (1).

The operation of a crystalline undulator should be con-
sidered in the large-amplitude regime. Omitting the dis-
cussion (see Ref. [1, 2]), we note that the limit a/d > 1
accompanied by the condition C ≪ 1 is mostly advanta-
geous, since in this case the characteristic frequencies of
undulator and channeling radiation are well separated,
so that the latter does not aﬀect the parameters of the
former, whereas the intensity of undulator radiation be-
comes comparable or higher than that of the channeling
one [1, 8]. A strong inequality a ≪ λ, resulting in elas-
tic deformation of the crystal, leads to moderate values
of the undulator parameter p ∼ 1 which ensure that the
emitted radiation is of the undulator type rather than of
the synchrotron one.

The term ’undulator’ implies that the number of peri-
ods, N , is large. Only then the emitted radiation bears
the features of an undulator radiation (narrow, well-
separated peaks in spectral-angular distribution). This
is stressed by the third condition in (1).

The essential diﬀerence between a crystalline undula-
tor and a conventional one, based on the action of a mag-
netic (or electric) ﬁeld [7], is that in the latter the beams
of particles and photons move in vacuum whereas in the
former – in a crystalline medium, where they are aﬀected
by the dechanneling and the photon attenuation. The
dechanneling eﬀect stands for a gradual increase in the
transverse energy of a channeled particle due to inelastic
collisions with the crystal constituents [5]. At some point
the particle gains a transverse energy higher than the pla-
nar potential barrier and leaves the channel. The average
interval for a particle to penetrate into a crystal until it
In a
dechannels is called the dechanneling length, Ld.
straight channel this quantity depends on the crystal, on
the energy and the type of a projectile. In a periodically
bent channel there appears an additional dependence on
the parameter C. The intensity of the photon ﬂux, which
propagates through a crystal, decreases due to the pro-
cesses of absorption and scattering. The interval within
which the intensity decreases by a factor of e is called the
attenuation length, La(ω). This quantity is tabulated for
a number of elements and for a wide range of photon fre-
quencies (see, e.g., Ref. [9]). The forth condition in (1)
takes into account severe limitation of the allowed val-
ues of the length L of a crystalline undulator due to the
dechanneling and the attenuation.

Finally, let us comment on the last condition in (1).
For suﬃciently large photon energies (ω & 102 keV) the
restriction due to the attenuation becomes less severe

2

than due to the dechanneling eﬀect [1, 2]. Then, Ld(C)
introduces an upper limit on the length of a crystalline
undulator. Indeed, it was demonstrated [3, 10] that in
the limit L ≫ Ld the intensity of radiation is not deﬁned
by the expected number of undulator periods L/λ but
rather is formed in the undulator of the eﬀective length
∼ Ld. Since for an ultra-relativistic particle Ld ∝ ε
[11, 12, 13], it seems natural that to increase the eﬀec-
tive length one can consider higher energies. However,
at this point another limitation manifests itself [1, 14].
The coherence of an undulator radiation is only possible
when the energy loss ∆ε of the particle during its passage
through the undulator is small, ∆ε ≪ ε. This statement
together with the fact, that for an ultra-relativistic pro-
jectile ∆ε is mainly due to the photon emission [13], leads
to the conclusion that L must be much smaller than the
radiation length Lr, - the distance over which a particle
converts its energy into radiation.

For a positron-based crystalline undulator a thorough
analysis of the system (1) was carried out for the ﬁrst
time in Refs. [1, 2, 3, 8, 14]. For a number of crystals the
ranges of ε, a, λ and ω were established within which the
operation of the crystalline undulator is possible. These
ranges include ε = (0.5 . . . 5) GeV, a/d = 101 . . . 102,
C = 0.01 . . . 0.2, N ∼ Nd = Ld/λ = 101 . . . 102, ω & 102
keV and are common for all the investigated crystals.
The importance of exactly this regime of operation of the
positron-based crystalline undulator was later realized by
other authors [15, 16].

In the case of electron channeling the restrictions due
to the dechanneling eﬀect on the parameters of undula-
tor are much more severe [1, 2]. Therefore, it has been
commonly acknowledged that the concept of an electron-
based undulator cannot be realized. In what follows we
demonstrate, for the ﬁrst time, that the crystalline un-
dulator based on ultra-relativistic electron channeling is
feasible, but it operates in the regime of higher beam
energies than the positron-base undulator.

FIG. 2: Positron and electron dechanneling lengths in the
straight channels versus ε. Solid, dashed, long-dashed and
chain lines correspond to C (111), Si (111), Ge (111) and W
(110). The horizontal lines show the radiation lengths [17].

It is important to note that for negative and for
positive projectiles the dechanneling occurs in diﬀerent
regimes. Positrons, being repulsed by the interplanar po-
tential, channel in the regions between two neighboring
planes, whereas electrons channel in close vicinity of ion
planes (see Fig. 1). Therefore, the number of collisions
with the crystal constituents is much larger for electrons
and they dechannel faster. Fig. 2, which presents the de-
pendences of Ld on ε for planar channeling of positrons
and electrons in various straight crystals, illustrates this
statement [17]. It is seen that for all energies the dechan-
neling length for e+ exceeds that for e− by more than an
order of magnitude. Such a large diﬀerence (consistent
with the experimental [18] and other theoretical [6] data)
is the reason why the crystalline undulator problem has
been analyzed, so far, only for positrons.

FIG. 3: Parameters of the undulator and undulator radiation
as functions of λ for 50 GeV electron channeling in Si along
the (111) crystallographic planes. In each graph solid, dashed
and chain curves correspond to the ﬁxed numbers of undu-
lator periods within the dechanneling length: Nd = 5, 10, 15,
respectively. Thick parts of the curves mark the regions where
a/d ≥ 1.

As mentioned, a positron-based undulator is feasible
for ε . 5 GeV. For these energies, see Fig. 2, the radiation
length greatly exceeds Ld (or, in other words, ∆ε ≪ ε),
and it is possible to achieve N ∼ 10 . . . 102 within Ld [2,
3]. The corresponding values of the undulator period are
λ = 10−4 . . . 10−2 cm, i.e. exactly the interval to which
the electron dechanneling lengths belong. Therefore, for
0.5 . . . 5 GeV electrons the number of undulator periods is
∼ 1, thus indicating that this system is not an undulator.
However, Fig. 2 suggests that the electron-based undu-
lator can be discussed for higher energies, ε = 10 . . . 102
GeV, where Ld is large enough to ensure Nd ≫ 1 but
still is much lower than Lr. To demonstrate the feasibil-
ity of such an undulator one must carry out the analysis
of other conditions from (1) and establish the ranges of
a, λ and ω within which the operation of the electron-

3

based crystalline undulator is possible. In Figs. 3 and 4
we present the results of such an analysis performed for
50 GeV electron channeling in Si (111).

Figs. 3(a,b) present the ranges of parameters of the
electron-based undulator. In Fig. 3(a) the ratio a/d ver-
sus λ is shown for ﬁxed values of undulator periods within
the dechanneling length, i.e. for Nd = Ld(C)/λ = const
(the curves correspond to Nd = 5, 10, 15 and this is also
valid for other graphs in the ﬁgure). This graph illus-
trates the ranges of a, λ and Nd within which the second
and third conditions from (1) are met. Fig. 3(b) presents
the dependences C(λ) and illustrates the fulﬁllment of
the condition for the stable channeling. Figs. 3(a,b) sug-
gest that the undulator can be devised for a = 2 . . . 20
˚A, λ = 10 . . . 102 µm, which are close to parameters of
a positron-based undulator [2, 3, 4]. Therefore, to con-
struct an electron-based undulator one can consider the
methods proposed earlier: propagation of an acoustic
wave [1, 20], or the use of a graded composition of diﬀer-
ent layers [4, 19], or periodic mechanical deformation of
the crystalline structure [4, 15].

Figs. 3(c,d) present the parameters of the undula-
tor radiation, - the energy of fundamental harmonic,
ω1 = 8πγ2cλ−1/(2 + p2), and the peak value of the spec-
tral distribution d3Emax/~dω dΩ (scaled by the factor
γ−2) of the energy emitted in the forward direction at
ω = ω1 - as functions of λ. To calculate d3Emax/~dω dΩ
we used the formalism, developed in [3] to describe the
undulator radiation in presence of the dechanneling and
the photon attenuation (i.e. the decrease in the intensity
of the photon ﬂux in a crystal). For each λ the crystal
length was chosen as L ≈ 4Ld(C). This value is close to
the optimal length of the undulator, which ensures the
highest yield of the photons for given C, ε and ω1 [3].

Figs. 3(c,d) show that both the photon energy and the
intensity of undulator radiation can be varied over wide
ranges (note the log scale). However, it is important to
compare these quantities with the characteristics of the
channeling radiation. This is done in Fig. 4, where the
spectral distributions of undulator and channeling radi-
ation in the forward direction are presented for the indi-
cated values of C (using which in Fig. 3(a,b) one ﬁnds
the values of a/d and λ). The spectra were calculated
with the account for the dechanneling and the photon
attenuation [3]. To calculate the spectrum of channeling
radiation we, ﬁrst, calculated the spectra for individual
trajectories (using the P¨oschl-Teller model [13] for the
interplanar potential acting on an electron), correspond-
ing to stable channeling for given C. Then, the averag-
ing procedure was applied to calculate the spectra (see
Refs. [8] for the details).

The graphs in Fig. 4 clearly demonstrate that by tun-
ing the parameters of bending it is possible to separate
the frequencies of the undulator radiation from those of
the channeling radiation, and to make the intensity of
the former comparable or higher than of the latter.

FIG. 4: Spectra of the undulator (narrow peaks) and channeling (wide peaks) radiation emitted in the forward direction for
50 GeV electron channeling in Si (111) and for diﬀerent values of the parameter C. The undulator radiation: the ﬁrst (i.e., the
leftest) narrow peaks correspond to Nd = 5 (in the ﬁgures for C=0.20 and C=0.40 they are hardly visible), the second peaks -
to Nd = 10, and the third peak (only in the ﬁgure for C=0.20) - to Nd = 15. The crystal length is chosen as L ≈ 4Ld(C).

In summary, we have demonstrated that it is feasible
to devise an undulator based on the channeling eﬀect of
a bunch of ultra-relativistic electrons through a period-
ically bent crystal. An electron-based undulator oper-
ates in the regime of higher energies of projectiles than
a positron-based one. The present technologies are suf-
ﬁcient to achieve the necessary conditions to construct
the undulator and to create, on its basis, powerful radi-
ation sources in the γ-region of the spectrum. As in the
positron case [1] it is meaningful to explore the idea of a
γ-laser by means of an electron-based undulator.

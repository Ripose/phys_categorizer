We present applications of variational – wavelet approach to three diﬀerent models
of nonlinear beam motions with underlying collective behaviour: Vlasov-Maxwell-
Poisson systems, envelope dynamics, beam-beam model. We have the represen-
tation for dynamical variables as a multiresolution (multiscales) expansion via
high-localized nonlinear eigenmodes in the base of compactly supported wavelet
bases. Numerical modelling demonstrates formation of coherent structures and
stable patterns.

1 Introduction

In this paper we consider the applications of a new numerical-analytical
technique which is based on the methods of local nonlinear harmonic anal-
ysis or wavelet analysis to three nonlinear beam/accelerator physics prob-
lems which can be characterized by collective type behaviour: some forms of
Vlasov-Maxwell-Poisson equations[1], RMS envelope dynamics[2], the model
of beam-beam interactions[3]. Such approach may be useful in all models in
which it is possible and reasonable to reduce all complicated problems re-
lated with statistical distributions to the problems described by systems of
nonlinear ordinary/partial diﬀerential equations with or without some (func-
tional)constraints. Wavelet analysis is a relatively novel set of mathematical
methods, which gives us the possibility to work with well-localized bases in
functional spaces and gives the maximum sparse forms for the general type
of operators (diﬀerential, integral, pseudodiﬀerential) in such bases. Our ap-
proach is based on the variational-wavelet approach from [4]-[14], which allows
us to consider polynomial and rational type of nonlinearities. The solution
has the following multiscale/multiresolution decomposition via nonlinear high-
localized eigenmodes

aijU i(x)V j(t),

which corresponds to the full multiresolution expansion in all underlying
time/space scales (x are the generalized space coordinates or phase space
coordinates, t is time coordinate). Formula (1) gives us expansion into the
slow part uslow
N,M and fast oscillating parts for arbitrary N, M. So, we may
move from coarse scales of resolution to the ﬁnest one for obtaining more
detailed information about our dynamical process. The ﬁrst terms in the
RHS of formulae (1)-(3) correspond on the global level of function space de-
composition to resolution space and the second ones to detail space. In this
way we give contribution to our full solution from each scale of resolution or
each time/space scale or from each nonlinear eigenmode (Fig.1). The same
is correct for the contribution to power spectral density (energy spectrum):
we can take into account contributions from each level/scale of resolution.
In all these models numerical modelling demonstrates the appearence of co-
herent high-localized structures and stable patterns formation. Starting in
part 2 from Vlasov-Maxwell-Poisson equations, root-mean-square (RMS) en-
velope dynamics and beam-beam interaction model we consider in part 3 the
approach based on variational-wavelet formulation. We give explicit represen-
tation for all dynamical variables in the base of compactly supported wavelets
or nonlinear eigenmodes. Our solutions are parametrized by solutions of a
number of reduced algebraical problems one from which is nonlinear with the
same degree of nonlinearity and the rest are the linear problems which corre-
spond to particular method of calculation of scalar products of functions from
wavelet bases and their derivatives. In part 4 we consider numerical modelling
based on our analytical approach.

2 Collective models

2.1 Vlasov-Maxwell-Poisson Equations

Analysis based on the non-linear Vlasov-Maxwell-Poisson equations leads to
more clear understanding of the collective eﬀects and nonlinear beam dy-
namics of high intensity beam propagation in periodic-focusing and uniform-
focusing transport systems. We consider the following form of equations

2.2 RMS Equations

We consider an approach based on the second moments of the distribution
functions for the calculation of evolution of RMS envelope of a beam. The
RMS envelope equations are the most useful for analysis of the beam self–
forces (space–charge) eﬀects and also allow to consider both transverse and
longitudinal dynamics of space-charge-dominated relativistic high–brightness
axisymmetric/asymmetric beams, which under short laser pulse–driven radio-
frequency photoinjectors have fast transition from nonrelativistic to relativis-

tic regime [2]. Analysis of halo growth in beams, appeared as result of bunch
oscillations in the particle-core model, also are based on three-dimensional
envelope equations [2]. We can consider the diﬀerent forms of RMS envelope
equations, which are not more than nonlinear diﬀerential equations with ra-
tional nonlinearities and variable coeﬃcients from the formal point of view.
Let f (x1, x2) be the distribution function which gives full information about
noninteracting ensemble of beam particles regarding to trace space or trans-
verse phase coordinates (x1, x2). Then we may extract the ﬁrst nontrivial
eﬀects of collective dynamics from the second moments

We will consider the following particular cases of RMS envelope equations,
which describe evolution of the moments (9) ([2] for full designation):
for

order for σx1 and σx2 :

The envelope equation for an axisymmetric beam is a particular case of pre-
ceding equations. Also we have related Lawson’s equation for evolution of
the rms envelope in the paraxial limit, which governs evolution of cylindrical
symmetric envelope under external linear focusing channel of strenght Kr:

the following form for envelope equations in the model of halo formation by

where X(s), Y(s), Z(s) are bunch envelopes, ξx, ξy, ξz = F (X, Y, Z).

After transformations to Cauchy form we can see that all these equations
from the formal point of view are not more than ordinary diﬀerential equations
with rational nonlinearities and variable coeﬃcients Also, we may consider
regimes in which γ, γ′ are not ﬁxed functions/constants but satisfy some
additional diﬀerential constraints/equations, but this case does not change
our general approach of the next part.

2.3 Beam-beam modelling

tial collective description by some sort of equation for distribution function

is reduced to Fockker-Planck (FP) equation on the ﬁrst stage and to very

which solution gives the parameters of enveloping gaussian anzatz for solution
of FP equation, on the second stage. From the formal point of view equations
(14) are particular case of system (12).

3 Rational Dynamics

After some anzatzes [15] our problems may be formulated as the systems of
ordinary diﬀerential equations (cases 2.2 and 2.3 (system (14)) above)

or a set of such systems (cases 2.1, 2.3 (full equation (13)) above) corre-
sponding to each independent coordinate in phase space. They have the ﬁxed
initial(or boundary) conditions xi(0), where Pi, Qi are not more than poly-
nomial functions of dynamical variables xj and have arbitrary dependence

of time. Because of time dilation we can consider only next time interval:
0 ≤ t ≤ 1. Let us consider a set of functions

and a set of functionals

Φi(t) = xi

(Qiyi) + Piyi

d
dt

Fi(x) =

Φi(t)dt − Qixiyi |1
0,

Z
0

where yi(t) (yi(0) = 0) are dual (variational) variables. It is obvious that the
initial system and the system

Fi(x) = 0

are equivalent. Of course, we consider such Qi(x) which do not lead to the
singular problem with Qi(x), when t = 0 or t = 1, i.e. Qi(x(0)), Qi(x(1)) 6=
∞.

Now we consider formal expansions for xi, yi:

xi(t) = xi(0) +

λk
i ϕk(t)

yj(t) =

ηr
j ϕr(t),

(19)

Xk

Xr

where ϕk(t) are useful basis functions of some functional space (L2, Lp,
Sobolev, etc) corresponding to concrete problem and because of initial condi-
tions we need only ϕk(0) = 0, r = 1, ..., N,

λ = {λi} = {λr

i } = (λ1

i , λ2

(20)

i = 1, ..., n,
i , ..., λN

i ),

where the lower index i corresponds to expansion of dynamical variable with
index i, i.e. xi and the upper index r corresponds to the numbers of terms
in the expansion of dynamical variables in the formal series. Then we put
(19) into the functional equations (18) and as result we have the following
reduced algebraical system of equations on the set of unknown coeﬃcients λk
i
of expansions (19):

L(Qij, λ, αI ) = M (Pij , λ, βJ ),

(21)

where operators L and M are algebraization of RHS and LHS of initial problem
(15), where λ (20) are unknowns of reduced system of algebraical equations
(RSAE)(21).

Qij are coeﬃcients (with possible time dependence) of LHS of initial sys-
tem of diﬀerential equations (15) and as consequence are coeﬃcients of RSAE.
Pij are coeﬃcients (with possible time dependence) of RHS of initial sys-
tem of diﬀerential equations (15) and as consequence are coeﬃcients of RSAE.

I = (i1, ..., iq+2), J = (j1, ..., jp+1) are multiindexes, by which are labelled αI
and βI are other coeﬃcients of RSAE (21):

βJ = {βj1...jp+1} =

ϕjk ,

Z Y1≤jk≤p+1

(22)

where p is the degree of polinomial operator P (15)

αI = {αi1 ...αiq+2 } =

(23)

Xi1,...,iq+2

where q is the degree of polynomial operator Q (15), iℓ = (1, ..., q + 2),
dϕis /dt.

˙ϕis =

Now, when we solve RSAE (21) and determine unknown coeﬃcients from
formal expansion (19) we therefore obtain the solution of our initial problem.
It should be noted if we consider only truncated expansion (19) with N terms
then we have from (21) the system of N × n algebraical equations with degree
ℓ = max{p, q} and the degree of this algebraical system coincides with degree
of initial diﬀerential system. So, we have the solution of the initial nonlinear
(rational) problem in the form

xi(t) = xi(0) +

λk
i Xk(t),

(24)

N

Xk=1

where coeﬃcients λk
i are roots of the corresponding reduced algebraical (poly-
nomial) problem RSAE (21). Consequently, we have a parametrization of so-
lution of initial problem by solution of reduced algebraical problem (21). The
ﬁrst main problem is a problem of computations of coeﬃcients αI (23), βJ
(22) of reduced algebraical system. These problems may be explicitly solved
in wavelet approach [4]-[6]. The obtained solutions are given in the form
(24), where Xk(t) are basis functions and λi
k are roots of reduced system of
equations. In our case Xk(t) are obtained via multiresolution expansions and
represented by compactly supported wavelets and λi
k are the roots of corre-
sponding general polynomial system (21). Because aﬃne group of translation
and dilations is inside the approach, this method resembles the action of a
microscope. We have contribution to ﬁnal result from each scale of resolution
from the whole inﬁnite scale of spaces. More exactly, the closed subspace
Vj(j ∈ Z) corresponds to level j of resolution, or to scale j. We consider a
multiresolution analysis of L2(Rn) (of course, we may consider any diﬀerent
functional space) which is a sequence of increasing closed subspaces Vj :

...V−2 ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ ...

satisfying the following properties: let Wj be the orthonormal complement of
Vj with respect to Vj+1 : Vj+1 = Vj

Wj , then

L
L2(R) = V0

∞

Mj=0

Wj ,

(25)

This functional space decomposition corresponds to exact nonlinear eigen
mode decompositions (2),(3).
It should be noted that such representa-
tions give the best possible localization properties in the corresponding
(phase)space/time coordinates. In contrast with diﬀerent approaches formu-
lae (1)-(3) do not use perturbation technique or linearization procedures and
represent dynamics via generalized nonlinear localized eigenmodes expansion.
So, by using wavelet bases with their good (phase)space/time localization
properties we can construct high-localized coherent structures in spatially-ex-
tended stochastic systems with collective behaviour.

4 Modelling

Resulting multiresolution/multiscale representations for solutions of equa-
tions from part 2 in the high-localized bases/eigenmodes are demonstrated
on Fig. 2–Fig. 7. This modelling demonstrates the appearence of stable pat-
terns formation from high-localized coherent structures. On Fig. 2, Fig. 3 we
present contribution to the full expansion (1)-(3) from level 1 and level 4 of
decomposition (25). Figures 4, 5 show the representations for full solutions,
constructed from the ﬁrst 6 eigenmodes (6 levels in formula (25)). Figures 6,
7 show stable patterns formation based on high-localized coherent structures.

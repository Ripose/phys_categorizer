NONLINEAR ACCELERATOR PROBLEMS VIA WAVELETS:
4. SPIN-ORBITAL MOTION

A. Fedorova, M. Zeitlin, IPME, RAS, St. Petersburg, Russia ∗ †

Abstract

In this series of eight papers we present the applications of
methods from wavelet analysis to polynomial approxima-
tions for a number of accelerator physics problems. In this
part we consider a model for spin-orbital motion: orbital
dynamics and Thomas-BMT equations for classical spin
vector. We represent the solution of this dynamical sys-
tem in framework of biorthogonal wavelets via variational
approach. We consider a different variational approach,
which is applied to each scale.

1

INTRODUCTION

This is the fourth part of our eight presentations in which
we consider applications of methods from wavelet analy-
sis to nonlinear accelerator physics problems. This is a
continuation of our results from [1]-[8], which is based on
our approach to investigation of nonlinear problems – gen-
eral, with additional structures (Hamiltonian, symplectic or
quasicomplex), chaotic, quasiclassical, quantum, which are
considered in the framework of local (nonlinear) Fourier
analysis, or wavelet analysis. Wavelet analysis is a rela-
tively novel set of mathematical methods, which gives us
a possibility to work with well-localized bases in func-
tional spaces and with the general type of operators (dif-
ferential, integral, pseudodifferential) in such bases. In this
part we consider spin orbital motion. In section 3 we con-
sider generalization of our approach from part 1 to varia-
tional formulation in the biorthogonal bases of compactly
supported wavelets. In section 4 we consider the different
variational multiresolution approach which gives us possi-
bility for computations in each scale separately.

2 SPIN-ORBITAL MOTION

Let us consider the system of equations for orbital motion
and Thomas-BMT equation for classical spin vector [9]:
dq/dt = ∂Horb/∂p,
ds/dt =
w × s, where

dp/dt = −∂Horb/∂q,

w = −

q = (q1, q2, q3), p = (p1, p2, p3) are canonical position
and momentum, s = (s1, s2, s3) is the classical spin vec-
tor of length ¯h/2, π = (π1, π2, π3) is kinetic momen-
tum vector. We may introduce in 9-dimensional phase
space z = (q, p, s) the Poisson brackets {f (z), g(z)} =
fqgp − fpgq + [fs × gs] · s and the Hamiltonian equations
are dz/dt = {z, H} with Hamiltonian

H = Horb(q, p, t) + w(q, p, t) · s.

We will consider this dynamical system also in another pa-
per via invariant approach, based on consideration of Lie-
Poison structures on semidirect products. But from the
point of view which we used in this paper we may con-
sider the similar approximations as in the preceding parts
and then we also arrive to some type of polynomial dynam-
ics.

3 VARIATIONAL APPROACH IN
BIORTHOGONAL WAVELET BASES

Because integrand of variational functionals is represented
by bilinear form (scalar product) it seems more reasonable
to consider wavelet constructions [10] which take into ac-
count all advantages of this structure. The action functional
for loops in the phase space is [11]

F (γ) =

pdq −

H(t, γ(t))dt

(4)

Z

Zγ

The critical points of F are those loops γ, which solve
the Hamiltonian equations associated with the Hamiltonian

H and hence are periodic orbits. By the way, all critical
points of F are the saddle points of inﬁnite Morse index,
but surprisingly this approach is very effective. This will
be demonstrated using several variational techniques start-
ing from minimax due to Rabinowitz and ending with Floer
homology. So, (M, ω) is symplectic manifolds, H : M →
R, H is Hamiltonian, XH is unique Hamiltonian vec-
tor ﬁeld deﬁned by ω(XH(x), υ) = −dH(x)(υ),
υ ∈
x ∈ M, where ω is the symplectic structure.
TxM,
A T-periodic solution x(t) of the Hamiltonian equations
˙x = XH (x) on M is a solution, satisfying the boundary
conditions x(T ) = x(0), T > 0. Let us consider the loop
space Ω = C∞(S1, R2n), where S1 = R/Z, of smooth
loops in R2n. Let us deﬁne a function Φ : Ω → R by
setting

Z

Φ(x) =

< −J ˙x, x > dt −

H(x(t))dt,

x ∈ Ω

(5)
The critical points of Φ are the periodic solutions of ˙x =
XH (x). Computing the derivative at x ∈ Ω in the direction
of y ∈ Ω, we ﬁnd

Φ′(x)(y) =

Φ(x + ǫy)|ǫ=0 =

< −J ˙x − ▽H(x), y > dt

Consequently, Φ′(x)(y) = 0 for all y ∈ Ω iff the loop x
satisﬁes the equation

− J ˙x(t) − ▽H(x(t)) = 0,

(7)

i.e. x(t) is a solution of the Hamiltonian equations, which
also satisﬁes x(0) = x(1), i.e. periodic of period 1. Pe-
riodic loops may be represented by their Fourier series:
ek2πJtxk, xk ∈ R2k, where J is quasicomplex
x(t) =
structure. We give relations between quasicomplex struc-
ture and wavelets in our other paper. But now we need to
take into account underlying bilinear structure via wavelets.
We started with two hierarchical sequences of approxima-
tions spaces [10]:

P

. . . V−2 ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V2 . . . ,
V2 . . . ,
. . .

V−2 ⊂

V−1 ⊂

V1 ⊂

V0 ⊂

and as usually, W0 is complement to V0 in V1, but now
not necessarily orthogonal complement. New orthogonal-
ity conditions have now the following form:

W0 ⊥ V0, W0 ⊥

V0,

Vj ⊥

Wj,

Vj ⊥ Wj

translates of ˜ψ span

< ψjk, ˜ψj′k′ >=

ψjk(x) ˜ψj′ k′ (x)dx = δkk′ δjj′ ,

∞

Z

−∞

where ψjk(x) = 2j/2ψ(2jx−k). Functions ϕ(x), ˜ϕ(x−k)
form dual pair: < ϕ(x − k), ˜ϕ(x − ℓ) >= δkl, < ϕ(x −
k), ˜ψ(x − ℓ) >= 0. Functions ϕ, ˜ϕ generate a multiresolu-
tion analysis. ϕ(x − k), ψ(x − k) are synthesis functions,
˜ϕ(x − ℓ), ˜ψ(x − ℓ) are analysis functions. Synthesis func-
tions are biorthogonal to analysis functions. Scaling spaces
are orthogonal to dual wavelet spaces. Two multiresolu-
tions are intertwining Vj +Wj = Vj+1,
Vj+1.
Vj +
These are direct sums but not orthogonal sums.

e
So, our representation for solution has now the form

Wj =

f

e

f (t) =

˜bjkψjk(t),

Xj,k

(11)

where synthesis wavelets are used to synthesize the func-
tion. But ˜bjk come from inner products with analysis
wavelets. Biorthogonality yields

˜bℓm =

f (t) ˜ψℓm(t)dt.

Z

(12)

So, now we can introduce this more complicated construc-
tion into our variational approach. We have modiﬁcation
only on the level of computing coefﬁcients of reduced non-
linear algebraical system. This new construction is more
ﬂexible. Biorthogonal point of view is more stable un-
der the action of large class of operators while orthogonal
(one scale for multiresolution) is fragile, all computations
are much more simpler and we accelerate the rate of con-
vergence. In all types of Hamiltonian calculation, which
are based on some bilinear structures (symplectic or Pois-
sonian structures, bilinear form of integrand in variational
integral) this framework leads to greater success. In par-
ticular cases we may use very useful wavelet packets from
Fig. 1.

4 EVALUATION OF NONLINEARITIES
SCALE BY SCALE.NON-REGULAR
APPROXIMATION.

We use wavelet function ψ(x), which has k vanishing mo-
ments
cℓϕℓ(x)

xkψ(x)dx = 0, or equivalently xk =

R

P

for each k, 0 ≤ k ≤ K. Let Pj be orthogonal projector on
space Vj. By tree algorithm we have for any u ∈ L2(R)
and ℓ ∈ Z, that the wavelet coefﬁcients of Pℓ(u), i.e. the
set {< u, ψj,k >, j ≤ ℓ − 1, k ∈ Z} can be compute using
hierarchic algorithms from the set of scaling coefﬁcients in
the set {< u, ϕℓ,k >, k ∈ Z} [12]. Because for
Vℓ, i.e.
ϕ(x)dx = 1,
scaling function ϕ we have in general only
therefore we have for any function u ∈ L2(R):

R

and since the projection error in
V : kf (u)− P ¯V (f (u)) kL2
is much smaller than the projection error in Vq we have
e
the improvement (20) of (18). In concrete calculations and
estimates it is very useful to consider approximations in the
particular case of c-structured space:

V =

Vq +

span{ψj,k,

(22)

p−1

Xj=q

lim
j→∞,k2−j →x

| 2j/2 < u, ϕj,k > −u(x) |= 0

(13)

e

k ∈ [2(j−1) − c, 2(j−1) + c] mod 2j}

If the integer n(ϕ) is the largest one such that

xαϕ(x)dx = 0

for

1 ≤ α ≤ n

(14)

Z

then if u ∈ C(n+1) with u(n+1) bounded we have for j →
∞ uniformly in k:

| 2j/2 < u, ϕj,k > −u(k2−j) |= O(2−j(n+1)).

(15)

Such scaling functions with zero moments are very use-
ful for us from the point of view of time-frequency local-
ization, because we have for Fourier component ˆΦ(ω) of
them, that exists some C(ϕ) ∈ R, such that for ω → 0
ˆΦ(ω) = 1 + C(ϕ) | ω |2r+2 (remember, that we con-
sider r-regular multiresolution analysis). Using such type
of scaling functions lead to superconvergence properties
for general Galerkin approximation [12]. Now we need
some estimates in each scale for non-linear terms of type
u 7→ f (u) = f ◦ u, where f is C∞ (in previous and future
parts we consider only truncated Taylor series action). Let
us consider non regular space of approximation
V of the
form

V = Vq ⊕

e

Wj,
Xq≤j≤p−1 f

Wj ⊂ Wj . We need efﬁcient and precise estimate of

V . Let us set for q ∈ Z and u ∈ L2(R)

with
f ◦ u on

fq(u) = 2−q/2

e

Y

Xk∈Z

f (2q/2 < u, ϕq,k >) · ϕq,k (17)

We have the following important for us estimation (uni-
formly in q) for u, f (u) ∈ H (n+1) [12]:

kPq (f (u)) −

fq(u)kL2 = O

For non regular spaces (16) we set

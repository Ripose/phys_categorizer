Asymptotic Analysis of Ultra-relativistic Charge

Abstract

This article oﬀers a new approach for analysing the dynamic behaviour of distributions of
charged particles in an electromagnetic ﬁeld. After discussing the limitations inherent in the
Lorentz-Dirac equation for a single point particle a simple model is proposed for a charged
continuum interacting self-consistently with the Maxwell ﬁeld in vacuo. The model is developed
using intrinsic tensor ﬁeld theory and exploits to the full the symmetry and light-cone struc-
ture of Minkowski spacetime. This permits the construction of a regular stress-energy tensor
whose vanishing divergence determines a system of non-linear partial diﬀerential equations for
the velocity and self-ﬁelds of accelerated charge. Within this covariant framework a particular
perturbation scheme is motivated by an exact class of solutions to this system describing the
evolution of a charged ﬂuid under the combined eﬀects of both self and external electromag-
netic ﬁelds. The scheme yields an asymptotic approximation in terms of inhomogeneous linear
equations for the self-consistent Maxwell ﬁeld, charge current and time-like velocity ﬁeld of the
charged ﬂuid and is deﬁned as an ultra-relativistic conﬁguration. To facilitate comparisons with
existing accounts of beam dynamics an appendix translates the tensor formulation of the pertur-
bation scheme into the language involving electric and magnetic ﬁelds observed in a laboratory
(inertial) frame.

1 Introduction

The intense international activity involved in probing the structure of matter on all scales, with
particle beams and radiation, owes much to recent advances in accelerator science and technology.
Developments in the production of high power laser radiation also oﬀer new avenues for accelerator
design and new diagnostic tools of relevance to medical science, engineering and the communications
industry. A common theme in these developments is the interaction between charged particles and
the electromagnetic ﬁeld in domains where relativistic eﬀects cannot be ignored.

It is remarkable that many of the challenges that must be addressed in order to develop and control
devices that accelerate charged particles have their origin in the interaction of particles with their own
electromagnetic ﬁeld. Despite the fact that the classical laws of electromagnetism were essentially
formulated over a century and a half ago the subject of electromagnetic interactions with matter
remains incomplete. This incompleteness has had concomitant eﬀects on the development of quantum
electrodynamics and renormalisation theory. At root, the diﬃculties reside in the recognition that

1

the quantum structure of matter at some scale is beyond observation. Furthermore, the classical
description of the electron as a point particle leads to singularities in the Maxwell self-ﬁelds that
inevitably create ambiguities in its interaction with the Maxwell ﬁeld. The general consensus is
that a useful domain of validity of the Lorentz-Dirac equation [1, 2, 3], describing covariantly the
radiation reaction on a point electron, can be accommodated by performing a“reduction of order”
that eﬀectively replaces the equation by a perturbative second order system for the particle world
line. One must then decide whether higher order terms in this expansion should be maintained given
the neglect of terms associated with the regularisation scheme. This approach is behind many of the
successful applications of approximate radiation reaction dynamics, despite the somewhat delicate
and unsatisfactory nature of the arguments that purport to support this approach.

It appears that the analysis of systems involving radiating matter has progressed by a very
successful symbiosis between experimental expediency and a variety of approximation schemes with
proven eﬀectiveness in diﬀerent domains of validity. However, as schemes for accelerating charged
particles in these devices become more complex and ambitious in their aims it is apparent that some
existing theoretical models are inadequate for a proper understanding of new challenges. Such models
are sometimes enshrined in large commercial computer codes that do not survive scientiﬁc scrutiny
or have documentation that makes contact with established scientiﬁc literature diﬃcult. As particle
energies increase with the use of higher intensity laser ﬁelds this issue becomes critical and more
reliable methods for accommodating radiation reaction must be found.

A mathematically coherent formulation of a closed system of partial diﬀerential equations describ-
ing the relativistic behaviour of charged matter with electromagnetic ﬁelds is inevitably non-linear
and, in general, exact solutions satisfying causal boundary conditions are intractable. The fact that
the eﬀects of (coherent and incoherent) radiation on micrometre-sized charged bunches in a host
of newly proposed advanced devices is a signiﬁcant barrier to development indicates that existing
approaches used to model such eﬀects are inadequate and that a new look at the whole problem is
timely.

Many of the radiation problems alluded to above can be circumvented by working entirely in
the language of ﬁelds rather than both particles and ﬁelds. This makes it possible to use intrin-
sic tensor ﬁeld theory and exploit to the full the power of diﬀerential geometry in a relativistic
spacetime framework. The geometric ﬁeld formulation oﬀers a number of powerful computational
advantages over existing formulations of beam dynamics. These include the maintenance of relativis-
tic covariance (local Lorentz transformation between local (accelerating) frames are unnecessary),
the use of curvilinear coordinates adapted to the geometry of particular problems (thereby facilitat-
ing imposition of boundary conditions), exploitation of available symmetries and the formulation of
coordinate-independent approximation schemes.

In this article a new approach is oﬀered for analysing the behaviour of distributions of charged
particles in a coupled electromagnetic ﬁeld environment. Guided by a simple model, an approxima-
tion scheme designed for charged distributions containing ultra-relativistic particles1 is explored. The
exact equations of motion are derived from the vanishing divergence of a relativistic stress-energy
tensor for matter and radiation. Before presenting the approximation scheme in detail we recall the
genesis of the radiation reaction for a point charge, mention its shortcomings and argue that these
may be overcome by treating a large collection of charged particles as a continuum.

1A novel deﬁnition of an “ultra-relativistic vector ﬁeld” relying entirely on the light-cone structure of spacetime is

given in Appendix A.1.

Due to its high symmetry, Minkowski spacetime admits a class of global charts that play a

contains a point charge in an external ﬁeld this approach must take into account
that part of the electromagnetic ﬁeld becomes singular on the world-line of the particle so the domain
above must exclude this line. Furthermore, one needs to postulate a stress-energy tensor for a stable
U
point particle. Without further information application of Stokes’ theorem then leaves an unknown
contribution to the conservation law. However, experiment indicates that accelerating electrons
(thought to be point particles) experience a reaction to their emitted radiation and that the power
radiated is in good agreement with the covariant Larmor formula [4]. A number of methods have been
devised in an attempt to accommodate this observed radiation reaction by adopting a regularisation
procedure that permits the use of Stokes’ theorem in a spacetime region that includes the particle
world-line.
Inevitably this requires some assumption of how the singular Coulombic stresses are
compensated by stresses that are not of electromagnetic origin. Early approaches invoked delicate
limiting processes and the use of both advanced as well as retarded solutions to Maxwell’s equations
[5, 3]. Dirac [5] oﬀered one of the simplest covariant regularisation schemes and the resulting equation
of motion is known as the Lorentz-Dirac equation. The use of both advanced and retarded solutions
is however unnecessary [6, 7].

To highlight the assumptions in the single particle approach to radiation reaction an outline is
given of how the Lorentz-Dirac equation can be derived using a coordinate system adapted to the
light-cone structure of spacetime and the time-like world-line of a particle on a parametrised history
given in the above chart as yµ = ξµ(u). For each value of u the unit tangent to the world-line is the

Although solutions to this system that self-accelerate can be eliminated by demanding contrived
data at diﬀerent points along the world-line there remain solutions that pre-accelerate in situa-
tions where the external ﬁeld is piecewise deﬁned in spacetime [3]. Although the duration of pre-
acceleration is probably classically unobservable for most electrons this general feature suggests that
not all of the assumptions above are acceptable.

One resolution of these diﬃculties [1] is to assume that the right hand side of (46) should be
mc2 iV Fext. Then the above assumptions

Although this oﬀers a workable scheme it is unclear what its limitations are in diﬀerent types of

number of accelerating high-energy particles in close proximity the neglect of higher order terms in
the expansion may be suspect.

2 Symmetric solutions to the coupled ﬁeld system

Although the ﬁeld system (52-55) appears considerably less complicated than a large number of
ordinary diﬀerential equations for a collection of accelerating charges, it is non-linear in (V, ρ, F )
and so obtaining exact solutions is diﬃcult except in certain simple circumstances. One method of
obtaining solutions in more general situations is to employ a perturbation scheme based on properties
of a particular class of exact solutions.

In this section a family of exact dynamical solutions with symmetries generated by ∂

∂y2 will
be described. Such highly symmetric solutions can be interpreted as accelerating “walls of charge”
moving in vacuo under the inﬂuence of their self-ﬁelds (their “space-charge” ﬁelds) and an externally
applied ﬁeld. The coordinate y0 will be identiﬁed with time t in an inertial laboratory frame (the

Thus one may reduce the problem to a ﬁeld theory on a 2-dimensional Lorentzian spacetime with
global coordinates y0, y3. The ﬁeld system (52-55) is solved exactly using a co-moving coordinate
system (τ, σ) adapted to the charged continuum. However, expressing the solutions in terms of
laboratory coordinates (t, z) requires the inverse of the mapping (τ, σ)
(t, z), which is generally
diﬃcult to obtain in closed form. To progress, a running parameter ε > 0 is introduced into the
(t, z) and a perturbation scheme in ε is established. This approach facilitates
mapping (τ, σ)
(t, z) and thereby leads to
an order-by-order construction of the inverse of the mapping (τ, σ)

2.1 Laboratory frame description

Although the solutions above are exact in terms of (τ, σ), solving (67) for ˆσ(t, z) in closed form is
impossible if ζ is arbitrary. One way of tackling this problem is to introduce a running parameter
ε > 0, replace ˆσ by a 1-parameter family of functions ˆσε and solve (67) for ˆσε order-by-order in ε.

To eﬀect the coordinate transformation from (τ, σ) to (t, z) ζ is replaced with the 1-parameter

family of functions ζ ε:

ζ ε(σ) =

ζ−1 + ζ0(σ).

1
ε

ext = 1

ε ζ−1 6

where ζ ε
= 0 and ζself = ζ0. One may interpret (70) by saying that external ﬁeld eﬀects (the
ﬁrst term 1
ε ζ−1) dominate the eﬀects of space-charge (the second term ζ0). The coeﬃcients of the ε
terms in (70) have been labelled by the ε-order of the term in which they appear; this convention
will be used consistently throughout this article.

A solution to (67) can be obtained order-by-order in ε using the series ansatz for t > 0

(70)

(71)

The electric ﬁeld component

ε(t, z) and 4-velocity ﬁeld V ε can be written entirely in terms of

which the approximate solution is valid (the half-plane t > 0) is a subset of the domain of the exact
solution (the entire (t, z) plane). This is not too surprising since the charged continuum is at rest at
t = 0 and the leading term J0 in the series for J ε is light-like:

This approach can lead to the series expansions for the highly symmetric solutions just discussed,
but can also yield ε expansions for solutions that depend on (x, y) as well as (t, z). A consequence
of the above series expansions is that the electric 4-current has the form

J ε = ρεV ε =

It will be shown below that the above expansions partially decouple the ﬁeld system (52-55) yielding
an inﬁnite hierarchy of equations that are amenable to solution when supplemented with appropriate
boundary conditions and initial data.

3 The perturbation scheme

Based on the above exact symmetric solution it is assumed that there exists a class of solutions
to (52-55) that represents conﬁgurations of charged particles in ultra-relativistic collective motion.
It is shown in Appendix A.1 that the notion of an ultra-relativistic 4-velocity vector ﬁeld can be
made precise and should be distinguished from the magnitude of a relative Newtonian speed that
can be deﬁned for any two time-like 4-vector ﬁelds. An ultra-relativistic velocity ﬁeld is a pointwise
limiting concept that depends on the existence of the forward light-cone structure at each event
in spacetime. To leading order in the expansion deﬁned below the velocity ﬁeld of the charged
continuum is light-like. The full series will be considered as an asymptotic expansion for a solution
to (52-55) and physically represents an ultra-relativistic conﬁguration controlled by the parameter
ε. Such conﬁgurations cannot of course be exhaustive. They are chosen to be representative of the
class relevant to charged beams in high-energy accelerators.

Although (87) is non-linear in the unknown ﬁeld V−1 it is straightforward to analyse; it can
be written as a quasi-linear second-order ordinary diﬀerential equation for the integral curves
of V−1 and is the only non-linear diﬀerential equation in this scheme.
It may seem that the pair of equations above oﬀer 5 scalar equations for 4 unknown scalars.
However, the contraction of the ﬁrst equation with V−1 identically vanishes, so there are only
4 independent equations. This can be seen6 by writing (87) with respect to an arbitrary

In conclusion, the only non-linear equations in the hierarchy developed in theorem 1 are those

for V−1. All of the remaining equations are linear and therefore, in principle, simpler to solve.

4 Example : Charged beam propagating in free space

As a simple application of the hierarchy (80-84) consider a high-energy charged beam propagating
in free space. Unlike the exact “wall of charge” solutions derived earlier, the charge distributions
considered here have ﬁnite extent transverse to and along the direction of propagation. The ﬁrst
eight steps of the hierarchy (80-84) are:

Step 1: The leading order Maxwell ﬁeld F−1 (the external ﬁeld) is chosen to vanish so (86) is trivially

satisﬁed.

Step 2: Using (87) the leading order 4-velocity ﬁeld V−1 satisﬁes

∇V−1V−1 = 0,

V−1 ·

V−1 = 0

since the external ﬁeld F−1 = 0. Therefore, consider solutions to (80-84) adapted to a null
geodesic coordinate system (u, v, x, y) where u = z

5 Conclusion

When analysing the dynamics of charged particle beams it is often fruitful to adopt a description
based on classical ﬁelds rather than classical point particles. Pathologies (such as pre-acceleration)
associated with radiating point particles are avoided by relying on ﬁeld-theoretical notions.

24

A novel analysis of charged beam dynamics has been presented and a model of a freely propagating
charged bunch discussed. The approach relies on an asymptotic series representation of solutions
to self-consistent spacetime covariant ﬁeld equations for (V, ρ, F ) describing a charged continuum.
The asymptotic series for V is based on the light-like vector ﬁeld V−1 leading to an ultra-relativistic
approximation. The hierarchy of equations obtained are more amenable to analysis than the original
non-linear ﬁeld system and particular solutions have been presented.

There are numerous avenues for the development of this work involving ultra-relativistic charged
beams in the vicinity of beam pipes, RF cavities, spoilers, etc. leading to dynamical eﬀects that are
often described in terms of “wake-ﬁelds” [8, 9]. This work will lead to a clearer understanding of
radiation-reaction exhibited by continuum models of charged particle beams.

A Appendix

A.1 Deﬁnition of ultra-relativistic and light-like limited vectors

The spacetime description of a classical point particle with mass m0 > 0 invokes a parametrised
curve (world-line) with a future-pointing time-like tangent vector. For aﬃnely parametrised curves
the tangent vector V (4-velocity) is normalised: V
1. A spacetime reference frame may be

V =

·

−

25

associated with a time-like vector ﬁeld U with U
1 and an “observer” in such a frame is
modelled by an integral curve of U. The 4-momentum of the particle is deﬁned to be p = m0 V .
At an event where an observer curve intersects the world-line of the particle one has the orthogonal
decomposition:

U =

−

·

where U
P is its 3-momentum. The Newtonian velocity v of the particle relative to U is

P = 0. Relative to U, the scalar

is the energy of the particle (in units with c = 1) and

Since U
U = V
0 it is traditional to say that the particle is
“relativistic” relative to U if
1. Clearly, such a notion depends
on both V and U and the nearness of P·P
to unity. Furthermore, one may always ﬁnd a frame in
E 2
which P = 0 and
= m0. However, given a particular frame U one may contemplate a 4-velocity V
that is relativistic relative to it. To generalise this notion for any frame one may consider a family
of 4-velocities V ε and invoke properties of V ε as ε tends to some limit.

The 1-parameter family of vector ﬁelds V ε is ultra-relativistic if and only if V−1 does not vanish

A.2 The perturbation hierarchy in Gibbs’ 3-vector notation

To facilitate a comparison with existing ﬂuid descriptions of beam dynamics [10, 11] that employ

b is the standard Euclidean dot product of two 3-vector ﬁelds a and b. Note that (118) can
where a
be obtained by taking the scalar product of p with the diﬀerential equation for p and the algebraic
constraint on γ and p in (117). Therefore, like the ﬁnal equation in (117) (charge conservation),
equation (118) is redundant. However, the two diﬀerential equations are treated very diﬀerently in
the subsequent asymptotic analysis. Equation (118) is automatically maintained order-by-order by
the algebraic constraint on γ and p but charge conservation must be imposed order-by-order. Hence,
(118) is not included in the following.

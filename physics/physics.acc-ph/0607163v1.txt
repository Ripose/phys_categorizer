Abstract

The study of beam transport is of central importance to the design and performance assessment of
modern particle accelerators. In this paper, we benchmark two contemporary codes, DIMAD and
BDSIM, the latter being a relatively new tracking code built within the framework of GEANT4.
We consider both the 20 mrad and 2 mrad extraction lines of the 500 GeV International Linear
Collider (ILC) and we perform particle tracking studies of heavily disrupted post-collision electron
beams. We ﬁnd that the two codes give an almost equivalent description of the beam transport.

1 Introduction

In a e+e− linear collider such as ILC [1], the beams must be focused to extremely small spot sizes
in order to achieve high charge densities and, in turn, to reach the desired luminosity. Because of
the extremely small transverse dimensions of the colliding beams, electrons and positrons experience
very strong transverse electromagnetic ﬁelds at the interaction point, which leads to the emission
of beamstrahlung photons, as well as large angular divergence and energy spread for the disrupted
beams. A careful design of the extraction lines must therefore be performed to transport the outgoing
beams and the beamstrahlung photons from the interaction point to their dumps with small losses.
At ILC, two conﬁgurations are being studied for the crossing angle at the interaction point and, as
a result, for the design of the post-collision lines. With a 2 mrad crossing angle, the main challenge
is the extraction of the disrupted beam, which has to be achieved by sending the outgoing beam
oﬀ-center in the ﬁrst large super-conducting defocusing quadrupole of the ﬁnal focus beam line, as
well as in the two nearby sextupoles [2, 3]. On the other hand, with a 20 mrad crossing angle [4],
one must deal with technical diﬃculties such as large crab-crossing corrections or the construction
of compact super-conducting quadrupoles for the incoming beam lines, as well as with the passage
of the beams through the solenoid ﬁeld with an angle. For the design of the ILC extraction
lines, it is essential to have a reliable simulation program for particle tracking.
In this study, we
present a comparison between two codes, DIMAD [5] and BDSIM [6], using the present versions
of the ILC post-collision lines for benchmarking purposes, in both large and small crossing angle cases.

The DIMAD program speciﬁcally aims at studying the behaviour of particles in circular machines or
beam lines, by computing their trajectories using the second order matrix formalism [7]. The present
version of the code makes sure that the matrix treatment remains correct to all orders for energy
deviations [5]. This is important here, as the ILC disrupted beams downstream of the interaction
point can have very large energy spreads. The BDSIM program [6] uses the closed solutions in linear
elements, whilst for higher-order elements, a GEANT4-like stepper integration method is used. The
program is written in GEANT4 [8] and provides a toolkit to fully simulate interactions of particles
with the surrounding matter once they have left the vacuum pipe. However, for the purpose of this
study, we only aim at comparing the tracking procedures in DIMAD and BDSIM: a more detailed
evaluation of the losses, with all particle-matter interactions and with the subsequent background
generation, is underway and will be the subject of a future report. In order to compare the tracking
procedures in DIMAD and BDSIM, we will proceed as follows.
In Section 2, we consider the ILC
extraction line with a 20 mrad crossing angle, where the disrupted beam remains centered in all
magnetic elements. We compare single particle trajectories as well as beam transverse spectra, as
they are obtained with DIMAD and BDSIM at various positions along the extraction line. Then, in
Section 3, we perform a similar analysis with the ILC 2 mrad post-collision line, where the geometry
is slightly more complicated, since the disrupted beam goes oﬀ-center in the ﬁrst magnetic elements.
Finally, a summary is given in Section 4.

2 DIMAD and BDSIM tracking in the 20 mrad extraction line

In order to compare the tracking procedures in DIMAD and BDSIM, we ﬁrst consider the ILC 20 mrad
extraction line. Thanks to the large crossing angle, one can use a dedicated line to transport each
outgoing beam from the interaction point to its dump. In the present design of the ILC 20 mrad
extraction line [4], the disrupted beam and the beamstrahlung photons go through the same magnets
to a common dump. The optics consists of a DFDF quadruplet, followed by two vertical chicanes
for energy and polarization measurements and a long ﬁeld-free region that allows the beam to grow
naturally, with two round collimators to reduce the maximum beam size at the dump. Figure 1 shows
the betatron functions and the vertical dispersion in this design.

2.1 Single oﬀ-momentum particles

For the sake of simplicity, we switch oﬀ any type of particle-matter interaction, including for the
moment synchrotron radiation, in BDSIM, since we want to benchmark the tracking procedures only.
Let us ﬁrst compare single particle trajectories. For this purpose, we track four particles with ideal
transverse coordinates (x = 0, x′ = 0, y = 0, y′ = 0) at the interaction point and increasing fractional
energy deviation δ. The ﬁrst one has the nominal energy (δ=0) and it thus follows a centered reference
path in all elements of the extraction line. The three other particles have lower energies (δ < 0): as a
result, they follow diﬀerent paths inside the magnetic chicanes, as shown in Figure 2. Note however
that, since the total vertical dispersion of both chicanes is equal to zero, all particles remain on the
same trajectory downstream of the chicanes. For all energies, there is a perfect agreement between
the single particle trajectories obtained with DIMAD (with no synchrotron radiation) and with the
tracking procedure of BDSIM.

Note that the paths are slightly diﬀerent when the synchrotron radiation is taken into account. To
illustrate this, let us track one 500 GeV electron along the ILC 20 mrad post-collision line with
DIMAD, with and without synchrotron radiation, for δ = 0 (see Figure 3) or δ = −0.5 (see Figure 4).

Figure 4: Eﬀect of the synchrotron radiation on the tracking in DIMAD for an electron with δ = −0.5

(E = 250 GeV).

The energy loss due to synchrotron radiation along the ILC post-collision line is larger for an electron
with δ = 0 than for an electron with δ = −0.5, as expected. When the electron radiates a fraction
of its energy, it leaves the reference path inside the bending magnets. Figures 3 and 4 show that this
eﬀect is relatively more important for particles having the nominal energy (which should be centered
in all magnetic elements) than for particles with a non-zero energy deviation (which are already
passing oﬀ-center in all magnetic elements). Note that the losses occuring during the transport of the
disrupted beams from the interaction point to the dumps concern almost exclusively particles with a
large energy deviation and almost never particles close to the nominal energy. Therefore, we expect
the synchrotron radiation to have a limited inﬂuence on the power lost along the ILC extraction line
and, for the rest of this study, we will switch oﬀ this eﬀect in both DIMAD and BDSIM.

2.2 Complete phase-space

Having shown that DIMAD and BDSIM agree perfectly when following single particles with various
energy deviations, let us now compare transverse distributions of particles at several locations along
the ILC extraction line. For this purpose, since we are not interested in a detailed estimation of the
losses along the post-collision line but only in the behaviour of the tracking in both simulations, we
use the suggested nominal beam parameters for ILC at a centre-of-mass energy of 500 GeV [10], for
which the beam transport from the interaction point to the dump is almost loss-free (at least with
the low-statistics input ﬁles that we use for this study). The corresponding particle distributions for
the e+/e− disrupted beams at the interaction point, just after the bunch crossing, obtained with the
GUINEA-PIG program [9] are shown in Figure 5.

for a centre-of-mass energy of 500 GeV in the nominal luminosity conﬁguration. Here, about
70000 e+/e− macro-particles are displayed.

Such particle distributions are transported along the ILC 20 mrad extraction line with either DI-
MAD or BDSIM. At several locations of interest (typically before, in and after each vertical magnetic
chicane), we project the transverse beam distributions obtained with each program into binned his-
tograms and we compare them quantitatively. An illustration of this procedure is shown in Figures 6
and 7 for the transverse beam distributions (x and y) that are obtained respectively at the secondary
focus point MEXFOC, located at s = 142.4 m (where βx and βy are very small, with a vertical disper-
sion of 2 cm) and at the dump. The open circles show the ratio between the number of events found

3 DIMAD and BDSIM tracking in the 2 mrad extraction line

In this section, we shall compare the DIMAD and BDSIM tracking procedures for the ILC 2 mrad
extraction line [2, 3]. This layout was developed in an attempt to preserve the physics advantages of
the head-on scheme suggested in the TESLA TDR [11], whilst mitigating the associated technological
challenges. In this scheme, the colliding beams cross with a small horizontal angle of around 2 mrad.
The outgoing disrupted beam then passes oﬀ-axis through the ﬁrst magnets of the incoming ﬁnal
focus beam line, so these magnets require a large magnetic bore. In the design used for this work, the
outgoing beam passes through the bore of the ﬁnal quadrupole QD0, both ﬁnal sextupoles but not
the second-to-ﬁnal quadrupole QF1. The outgoing beam sees however the pocket ﬁeld of this latter
magnet. The strongest design challenge lies in this shared doublet region, with current work focusing
on the choice of ﬁnal doublet magnet technology [3]. The extraction line of the 2 mrad scheme follows
the 20 mrad design, with the inclusion of downstream diagnostic structures. The current version of the
optics was presented at Snowmass 2005 [12, 13]. The corresponding linear optics is shown in Figures 8
and 9.

Figure 8: Betatron functions along the ILC 2 mrad post-collision line.

Following the doublet, the beam is focused with a series of large bore quadrupoles. This is followed by
an energy clean-up vertical chicane, diagnostic chicanes for the purpose of energy spectrometry and
polarimetry and, in the same way as in the 20 mrad scheme, a long ﬁeld-free region to allow the beam
to grow to the dump. Note that, in the 2 mrad scheme, separate dumps are used for the charged beam
and for the beamstrahlung photons.

3.1 Single oﬀ-momentum particles

We shall now, in exactly the same way as for the 20 mrad case, track single particles. We consider
three particles at the interaction point, with ideal transverse coordinates and energy deviations δ=0,
-0.2 and -0.4. The ﬁrst particle traces out the nominal trajectory. The oﬀ-momemtum particles
trace out diﬀerent trajectories, just as in the 20 mrad case, and the same comments with regard to
the downstream chicanes apply. For all momentum deviations, we see a perfect agreement between
DIMAD and BDSIM.

of the incoming beam line.

The 2 mrad case has an extra degree of complexity compared to the 20 mrad case. This is because
the beam is oﬀ-axis in the ﬁnal doublet, including in one case the pocket ﬁeld, which requires the
introduction of a multipole expansion in BDSIM. The extraction line after the ﬁnal doublet is then
aligned to ensure that the outgoing beam is on-axis in this part of the beamline. For the single particle
tracking, we align the extraction line to the nominal particle. When we consider beam distributions
(for example in the next section), we align the extraction line after the ﬁnal doublet to the outgoing
beam centroid. This transformation is implemented as an active transformation of the beam in DIMAD
and as a 3D transformation of the reference coordinate system in BDSIM. Note that the shift of the
particle trajectories can be seen in Figure 10.

3.2 Complete phase-space

Following the discussion of the 20 mrad BDSIM/DIMAD comparison in the previous section, we now
simply describe the results of the comparison for the 2 mrad case. The studies in this section were
performed for a 250 GeV disrupted beam with the same nominal parameters as in the previous section
(see Figure 5). Figures 11 to 13 show the results of the comparison at three extraction line locations.
Figures 11 and 12 show the comparison at MEXFOC1, which is located after the energy clean-up
chicane, and at MEXFOC2, which is the secondary focus of the polarimetry chicane, respectively. As
for Figure 13, it shows the comparison at the beam dump.

In these plots, chosen to be at various places of interest, we have projected the transverse beam disti-
butions obtained from the tracking into bins, and we have formed the ratio of the DIMAD prediction
to the BDSIM prediction. As in the previous section, the open circles show the ratio, with the error
bars accounting for the limited number of events in a given bin (again, the larger error bars are from
the beam tail where there are less events). All diagrams show a good agreement between DIMAD
and BDSIM for the ILC 2 mrad extraction line, except at the secondary focus of the polarimetry

8

chicane (MEXFOC2), where some slight discrepancies are visible. These may be due to the diﬀerent
treatments of high-order eﬀects in the optical transport for non-linear elements (see Section 1).

4 Conclusion

In this paper, we performed a detailed benchmarking study of two particle tracking codes, DIMAD
and BDSIM. For this purpose, we have considered the ILC extraction lines with a crossing angle
of 2 mrad or 20 mrad and, in each of these two conﬁgurations, we have performed tracking studies
of heavily disrupted post-collision electron beams. Here, only the nominal luminosity case of the
500 GeV machine was studied. We ﬁnd that both programs give an equivalent description of the
beam transport in all parts of the post-collision lines, except at the secondary focus for the 2 mrad
design.

A similar benchmarking study is presently being performed in order to compare the power losses
obtained with DIMAD and BDSIM along the ILC 2 mrad and 20 mrad post-collision lines. A more
comprehensive simulation study of the backgrounds from secondary particles will then follow.

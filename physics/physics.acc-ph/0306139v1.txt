Abstract

It has been well known for about half a century
that autoresonance (self-sustained resonance) phe-
nomena occur when a system continuously adjusts
its amplitude so that its instantaneous nonlinear pe-
riod matches the drive period, the eﬀect being a
growth of the system’s energy. Autoresonance ef-
fects were ﬁrst observed in particle accelerators1,2,
and have since been noted in nonlinear waves3,4,
ﬂuid dynamics5,6, atomic and molecular physics7,8,
plasmas9−11, nonlinear oscillators12,13, and planetary
dynamics14−17. In spite of the immense relevance and
scope of autoresonance phenomena, the only existing
theoretical approach to them is restricted to the very
particular case when the system stays locked with
an adiabatically varying perturbing oscillation (the
drive) and reduces to a Duﬃng-like oscillator at low
amplitude9−11,17. Here, a general exact theory of
autoresonance in both dissipative and Hamiltonian
nonautonomous systems is presented. An autoreso-
nance solution occurs when the system stays phase
locked with the excitation while its energy exhibits
maximum growth. The equations that together gov-
ern the autoresonance solutions and excitations are
derived with the aid of a variational principle con-
cerning the power functional. The theory is applied
to Duﬃng oscillators to obtain exact analytical ex-
pressions for autoresonance excitations and solutions
which explain all the (phenomenological and/or ap-
proximate) results arising from the aforementioned
previous approach to autoresonance phenomena.—

Apparently, the ﬁrst mention of the notion of res-
onance (“risonanza”) was by Galileo18. Remarkably,
this linear-system-based concept has survived up to
resonance (nonlinear resonance) is identiﬁed
now:
with how well the driving period ﬁts (a rational frac-
tion of) a natural period of the underlying conser-
vative system19. However, the genuine eﬀect of the
frequency (Galilean) resonance (FR) (i.e., the secular
growth of the oscillation amplitude) can no longer be
observed in a periodically driven nonlinear system.
As is well known, the reason is simple: a linear oscil-
lator has a single period which is energy-independent,
while nonlinear oscillators generally present an inﬁn-
ity of energy-dependent periods. Thus, if one is in-
terested in obtaining a nonlinear equivalent of the
secular maintained growth intrinsic to the FR, it
is clear that the system must not be driven by a
strictly periodic excitation.
In this regard, a pre-
vious theory of autoresonance3,7−11 (AR) provided
an early approach to the mechanism inducing the
growth of the oscillation (without the use of feed-
back) for a very particular class of resonantly driven
nonlinear systems which stay locked with an adiabat-
ically varying perturbing oscillation (the drive) even
if certain system parameters vary in time. The adi-
abatic excitation yields the autoresonant eﬀect by
automatically adjusting the system’s amplitude so
that the instantaneous nonlinear period matches the
driving period. That AR theory (hereafter referred
to as locking-by-passage-through-resonance (LPTR)
theory9−11,20) presents severe limitations of applica-
bility and insight: essentially, it solely can be applied

From Eq.
can be deduced such that the solutions of the system
given by Eqs. (2) and (5) together provide the AR so-
lutions, xAR(t), and the AR excitations, FAR(t). The
corresponding AR equations for the multidimensional
case can be straightforwardly obtained from the same
principle.

To compare the present approach with the previous
one9,11,20 (cf. Eq. (1)), consider the power functional

Note that Eq.
(6b) implies that the AR excita-
tions and the (corresponding) AR solutions have
the same instantaneous nonlinear period, at all in-
stants, which is inherent to AR phenomena but with-
out the adiabaticity requirement of the LPTR the-
ory. To obtain AR solutions (and hence AR excita-
(6b)) consider the ansatz xAR(t) =
tions, cf. Eq.
γf (t) cn [βg(t) + φ; m], where cn is the Jacobian el-
liptic function of parameter m, and where the con-
stants β, m, and the functions f (t), g(t) have to be
determined for the ansatz to satisfy Eq. (6a), while
γ, φ are arbitrary constants. After substituting this
ansatz into Eq.
(6b), one ﬁnds the set of coupled
diﬀerential equations which have to be satisﬁed by
m, β, f (t), and g(t):

for small amplitudes, where α is the sweep rate and
δ > 0. In the context of LPTR theory, it has been
found numerically that AR solutions only occur if
(i) the damping coeﬃcient δ is not too large, and
(ii) the amplitude of the AR oscillations grows on
the average, but also oscillates around the average
growth. Also, LPTR theory predicts that (iii) there
exists a threshold for AR, i.e., if the normalized exci-
exceeds a threshold propor-
tation amplitude ε/ω
tional to α3/4, the system will follow the excitation
to high amplitude, while the amplitude will stay very
low otherwise, (iv) that the threshold sweep rate αth

scales as δ
for AR, tb. Properties (ii), (iii), (v) also hold in (vi)
the case with no dissipation (refs 9, 11, 20).

Here a new, general, and exact theory for AR phe-
nomena in nonautonomous systems is presented and
applied to the above Duﬃng oscillators to explain
conjointly points (i)-(vi).

argument in Eq. (11) can be reliably approximated
by the ﬁrst two terms, as in LPTR theory (cf. Eq.
(1)). Point (vi) is rather striking in view of the very
diﬀerent properties of Hamiltonian and dissipative
systems, and its explanation is a little more subtle.
Firstly, note that current AR theory provides an
unsatisfactory result for the limiting Hamiltonian

possible types of corresponding particular solutions,
equilibria and those yielded by a constant excitation
(cf. Eqs. (2), (5)), can no longer be AR solutions.
Secondly, for the above Duﬃng oscillators we have
= FAR/2 (cf. Eq.
found
(6)). Therefore, it is natural to assume the ansatz
(cid:1)
.
F (t)
x(t), λ > 0, for the case with no dissipation,
where now the AR rate, λ, is a free parameter which
controls the initial excitation strength. Thus, the
corresponding AR solutions are given by Eq.
(8)
while AR excitations are given by the expression in
Eq. (9) multiplied by 1/2, both with λ instead of δ,
which explains point (vi).

A further question remains to be discussed: We
have seen why LPTR theory requires AR excita-
tions to be adiabatically varying perturbing oscilla-
tions, but which are the underlying adiabatic invari-
ants? To answer this question, note that Eq. (6a)
(with λ instead of δ for the case with no dissipa-
tion) can be derived from a Lagrangian, which one

It is straightforward to see that the gener-

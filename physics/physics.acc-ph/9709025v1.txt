Abstract

I present some simple exactly solvable models of spin diﬀusion caused by synchrotron
radiation noise in storage rings. I am able to use standard stochastic diﬀerential equa-
tion and Fokker-Planck methods and I thereby introduce, and exploit, the polarization
density. This quantity obeys a linear evolution equation of the Bloch type, which is, like
the Fokker-Planck equation, universal in the sense that it is independent of the state of
the system. I also brieﬂy consider Bloch equations for other local polarization quantities
derived from the polarization density. One of the models chosen is of relevance for some
existing and proposed low energy electron (positron) storage rings which need polariza-
tion. I present numerical results for a ring with parameters typical of HERA and show
that, where applicable, the results of my approach are in satisfactory agreement with
calculations using SLIM. These calculations provide a numerical check of a basic tenet of
the conventional method of calculating depolarization using the ~n-axis. I also investigate
the equilibrium behaviour of the spin ensemble when there is no synchrotron radiation.
Finally, I summarize other results which I have obtained using the polarization density
and which will be published separately.

Introduction

This paper provides an introduction to the use of spin polarization transport equations of
Fokker-Planck and Liouville type in electron (positron) and proton storage rings. As vehicles
for this study I use two exactly solvable but simple conﬁgurations called Machine I and Machine
II. 1

Machine I is a smoothed planar ring with no vertical emittance and with spins lying in
the machine plane which diﬀuse as the result of the stochastic nature of synchrotron radiation
photon emission. It is therefore an extremely simple arrangement but it serves to introduce the
concepts without the latter being obscured by unnecessary complication.

Machine II is similar to Machine I except that it contains a Siberian Snake and is therefore
relevant to some existing and proposed low energy electron storage rings. By introducing the
snake the equilibrium polarization is constrained to the machine plane together with the spins
and it therefore becomes possible to compare the Fokker-Planck approach with the conventional
method of calculating the spin depolarization rate and to comment on the validity of the latter.
A novel aspect of this work is the introduction of a phase space dependent quantity called the
polarization density. This satisﬁes an evolution equation of the Bloch type 2 which provides a
causal azimuthal evolution of the polarization density. This linear equation is universal, like the
Fokker-Planck equation, in the sense that it is independent of the state of the system. 3 There
is no equation which could provide a causal azimuthal evolution for the polarization vector
of a given ensemble, even in the simple cases of machines I and II. Other local polarization
quantities derived from the polarization density also obey evolution equations of the Bloch
type, but these equations depend on the orbital state of the system.

The basic orbital formalism needed is introduced in section 1. Then in section 2 the ﬁrst
model, Machine I, is studied. This conﬁguration was already used [BBHMR94a, BBHMR94b]
in a preliminary study of the rate of decoherence of spins (= ‘horizontal spin diﬀusion’) lying
in the machine plane of such a machine. As explained in those reports, the aim was to estimate
the diﬃculty of 4 using a radial rf ﬁeld to ﬂip spins which had been previously polarized into the
vertical direction by the Sokolov-Ternov eﬀect [ST64]. The approach adopted was to consider
the eﬀect of damped stochastic synchrotron motion on the development of the distribution of
spins lying in the machine plane and some numerical results were given. In this paper I will ﬁll
in some details omitted in [BBHMR94a, BBHMR94b] and develop some extra analytical tools.
The dynamics for Machine I can be studied for various initial spin-orbit distributions. In this
paper I consider two scenarios, i.e. two stochastic processes. The approach is pedagogical, step
by step and exhaustive and uses elementary methods for the solution of stochastic diﬀerential
equations. In scenario 1 I study the phase space distribution for a starting distribution which
is pointlike in both spin and orbit space. In scenario 2 I begin with a pointlike spin distribution
but with an orbital distribution which is already in equilibrium. The resulting phase space
evolutions are referred to as Process 1 and Process 2 respectively. By comparing the asymptotic
spin distributions I discover that they are not unique but that in both cases there is no complete
decoherence.
I also study the eﬀect of switching oﬀ the synchrotron radiation. Process 1
has some theoretical importance and Process 2 is more closely related to physical situations.
Numerical results for a machine similar to the HERA electron ring are presented.

1In appendices C and D I brieﬂy consider machines III and IV which are closely related to Machine I.
2For Bloch equations in spin diﬀusion problems, see [Abr61].
3But it is model dependent.
4For an earlier treatment, see also [Kou91].

3

In section 3 I consider Machine II, where in addition to the ﬁelds of Machine I the spin
experiences the inﬂuence of a pointlike Siberian Snake [DK78]. The aim here is to discover to
what extent a snake can, by its tendency to cancel spin perturbations, suppress decoherence. I
consider three scenarios, the stochastic processes 3,4,5. Process 3 has the same initial spin-orbit
distribution as in scenario 2 for Machine I and as one will see the spin exhibits transients for
the ﬁrst few orbital damping times. Process 4 has no transients and for Process 5 I set the
initial local polarization parallel to the ~n-axis [DK72, HH96] at each point in phase space. By
comparing these processes one ﬁnds that in the presence of radiation the asymptotic polarization
direction is not exactly parallel to the ~n-axis. Furthermore in the presence of the snake there
is complete depolarization.

All of the noise processes studied in this report are processes of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type 5
and in particular they are Markovian diﬀusion processes. One can determine their statistical
properties in an explicit form.

Finally, in an Epilogue, I summarize further results involving the polarization density. The
inclusion of a detailed account here would make this paper too long. These aspects will appear
in a separate article.

1 The orbital model

In this section I lay the foundations for the models to be discussed in sections 2 and 3.

The underlying mathematical model for machines I and II [BBHMR94a, BBHMR94b] com-
prises a three-dimensional spin-orbit system for the two longitudinal orbit variables and the
angle describing the orientation of the spin in the machine plane. In contrast to discrete stochas-
tic processes used occasionally in the literature my ‘time’ parameter s is continuous, so that I
can work with diﬀerential equations. Only synchrotron motion is considered and the inﬂuence
of the much faster betatron oscillations is neglected as are the Stern-Gerlach forces (back reac-
tion of the spin onto the orbit) and depolarizer ﬁelds [BHR94a, BHR94b, Hei96]. There are no
vertical bends so that the design orbit is planar. Underlying machines I and II is the ‘smooth
ring’ approximation. This takes advantage of the fact that the synchrotron tune is usually very
small so that the optical functions can be averaged around the ring. Then the combined orbital
motion is described by the following stochastic diﬀerential equation: 6

where s denotes the distance around the ring (the ‘azimuth’), σ the distance to the centre of
the bunch, η the fractional energy deviation, and ζ simulates the noise due to the synchrotron
radiation. Also αs is the one turn synchrotron damping decrement and ω is the one turn
averaged stochastic kick strength where in terms of the curvature Kx of the design orbit in the

< ζ(s) >= 0 .

Thus the stochastic part of the synchrotron radiation is treated as a Gaussian white noise
process. This is suﬃcient for my purposes since the characteristic time for the emission of a
photon is very small compared with other time scales of the system. Finally, κ is the compaction
factor, L is the length of the ring and Ωs = 2π
Qs/L where Qs is the synchrotron tune. The
·
ring is perfectly aligned so that in the smooth approximation the closed orbit and design orbit
are identical. The vertical emittance is taken to be zero.

2 Machine I

2.1

For ‘Machine I’ the spin vectors are restricted to the horizontal (machine) plane so that the spin
vector ~ξ can be described by a single phase angle ψ. 9 Although spin is a quantum mechanical
phenomenon, in high energy storage rings it can be treated at the semiclassical level using the
Thomas-BMT equation [Tho27, BMT59]

~ξ ,

~ξ ′ = ~ΩI ∧
describing the precession of a classical spin ~ξ in electric and magnetic ﬁelds. Alternatively I can
take ~ξ to be the spin expectation value of an electron in a pure state with spin along ~ξ/
. The
precession vector ~ΩI is a function of the magnetic and electric ﬁelds and of the particle velocity
and energy. As is usual in this context I now write ~ΩI as a sum of a piece ~ΩI,0 accounting for
the ﬁelds on the closed orbit and a piece ~Ωosc accounting for synchrotron motion with respect
to the closed orbit, i.e.

~ξ
||

(2.1)

||

~ΩI = ~ΩI,0 + ~Ωosc .

~ξ ′ = ~ΩI,0 ∧

~ξ .

Thus the Thomas-BMT equation on the closed orbit takes the form:

(2.2)

Since only motion in the horizontal plane need be considered one can write

~ΩI,0|| ·
~e3 ,
Ωosc ·
where ~e3 points normal to the machine plane. 10 By averaging (‘smoothing’) over one turn one
obtains:

~ΩI,0 ≡ ||
~Ωosc ≡

~e3 ,

~ΩI,0||
8Note that δ denotes Dirac’s delta function.
9The extension to full three-dimensional spin motion, i.e. the inclusion of vertical spin is brieﬂy considered

= (2πν/L) ,

||

in appendices C and D.

10Two additional unit-vectors ~e1, ~e2 are radial resp. longitudinal w.r.t. the closed orbit. Moreover ~e1, ~e2, ~e3

constitute an orthonormal, right-handed dreibein on the closed orbit. This deﬁnes the ‘machine frame’.

By only including synchrotron oscillations and averaging (smoothing) the instantaneous pre-

Thus ψ only couples to and is only driven by η.

One now sees that the noise not only acts on the orbit motion but also indirectly on the spin
via its coupling to η. It is this coupling which will lead to the spin decoherence.

11Thus ~n0,I is the so called ‘~n0-axis’ of Machine I.
12Note that ~ξ, unlike ~S, is the spin vector in an arbitrary frame. Thus (2.1), unlike (2.4a), is valid in an

arbitrary frame.

Because
three-component processes of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type [Gar85]. Thus the stochastic integra-
tions involved in the solution of (2.7) can be either deﬁned as Ito-integrations or Stratonovich-
integrations and lead by both methods to the Fokker-Planck equation (2.22). The analogous
situation holds for Machine II.

If s0 denotes the starting azimuth of a process ~x(s) then ~x(s0) is always assumed to be

chosen so that ~x(s) is a Markovian diﬀusion process [Arn73, Gar85]. 14

The three-component diﬀerential equation (2.7) has essentially only two nontrivial compo-

My chosen boundary conditions (see (2.20) and the sentences following) are very natural for
σ, η. After all, the rms relative energy spread for the values (2.12) is about 10−3 and the rms
bunch length is about 1 cm. On the contrary I will be dealing with spreads in ψ of order 2π
) for ψ.
or more so that at ﬁrst sight it would seem unnatural to choose the domain (
Indeed, if one writes the spin vector ~S in spherical coordinates as:

then by (2.3) one can identify ψ as the azimuthal angle, where the polar angle θ equals π/2.
Since the values ψ = 0 resp. ψ = 2π are identiﬁed it would then seem more appropriate to use
a probability density wper which fulﬁlls periodic boundary conditions in ψ:

wper(σ, η, ψ + 2π; s) = wper(σ, η, ψ; s) .

The normalization condition (2.20) would then be replaced by

However Process 2 considered in this section has, for s > 0, a Gaussian probability density.
Furthermore Process 1 has, for s > 0, a probability density which is a combination of a Gaussian
function and a delta function. 16 Thus it is more convenient to adopt boundary conditions
which allow one to work with Gaussians as much as possible. Thus machines I and II are
treated with the standard boundary conditions and the periodic boundary conditions are only
mentioned in passing.

16Both processes have standard boundary conditions.

equation (2.22). Moreover one then ﬁnds that wper,orb = worb.

The expression (2.42) is of special interest if semiclassical considerations come into play.
In fact by adopting the spinning particle Wigner function formalism of [Str57, GV88, GV89]
one originally deals with a Wigner function of the form (2.42) and its evolution equation, and
one can then in turn try to construct the probability density w and its underlying process, i.e.
design a model like Machine I from quantum mechanics.

Further remarks on the periodic boundary conditions are made in sections 2.7.3 and Ap-
pendix D. For the eﬀect of boundary conditions on Fokker-Planck equations, see also [Gar85]
and for the eﬀect on stochastic diﬀerential equations, see [GS71].

Clearly, from their deﬁnition the diagonal elements are always nonnegative. Furthermore the
σ matrix is nonnegative deﬁnite 17 and symmetric.

17This means that for every three-component vector ~v with real components one has the inequality:

If σ is nonsingular, then it is positive deﬁnite, i.e. the equal sign in the above inequality then only occurs for
~v = 0.

For the ﬁrst moment vector < ~x(s) > one gets the following diﬀerential equation:

< ~x′(s) > =

< ~x(s) > .

AI·

The diﬀerential equations (2.44),(2.45) can be easily derived from (2.7). They are valid for all
processes running with Machine I and are particularly useful for processes whose probability
densities are determined only by the covariance matrix and the ﬁrst moment vector such as
processes 1 and 2. These equations also show that for every process running with Machine I
the covariance matrix and the ﬁrst moment vector depend smoothly on s.

In Machine I 19 the orbital motion is not inﬂuenced by the spin motion (see (2.7)). Thus once the
orbital motion of a process has been determined, ﬁnding the spin motion reduces to solving the
stochastic diﬀerential equation (2.14b) for ψ. Equation (2.14b) for the process ψ(s) is equivalent
to the Thomas-BMT equation (2.4a) for the process ~S(s). The s-dependent vector ~WI(η(s)) is
a stochastic process whose properties are determined by the process η(s). With (2.4a) one has
moulded the spin motion of a stochastic process into the stochastic motion of the spin vector

18See also [Van81]. From the normalization (2.20) of w it also follows by (2.28):

19The same is true for Machine II.

for s > 0 so that in fact w1,orb is Gaussian for s > 0.

Now I have made the probability density w1 of Process 1 explicit. It is deﬁned by (2.62), where
w1,orb is given for s = 0 by (2.58) and for s > 0 by (2.65). The probability density w1 fulﬁlls the
Fokker-Planck equation (2.22) and the normalization condition (2.20). One sees that w1 factors
for s > 0 into a Gaussian function and a delta function. However w1 is not Gaussian because, as
follows from (2.61), the covariance matrix of Process 1 is singular. One thus observes the rather
unusual feature that not every process running with Machine I has a nonsingular covariance
matrix.

As mentioned in section 2.2.2 the three-component diﬀerential equation (2.7) has only two
nontrivial components. This is reﬂected by Process 1 because the probability density (2.62)
can be written as:

w1(σ, η, ψ; s) = w1,orb(σ, η; s)

So one gets 59% equilibrium polarization, i.e. only a moderate spin decoherence as already
pointed out in [BBHMR94a, BBHMR94b]. The detailed s-dependence is shown in ﬁgure 1
where one sees that the polarization reaches its asymptotic value after a few τdamp. Careful
inspection of the curve reveals a small ripple at twice the synchrotron frequency. Furthermore
one can show that σ1,33 approaches its equilibrium value on the scale of half the orbital damping
time τdamp.

Conventional wisdom has suggested that σψ should increase asymptotically like √s as for
any simple diﬀusion process. This is not the case as one has just seen. However, for the simpler
two-dimensional pure diﬀusion problem for η and ψ without synchrotron oscillations the √s
growth does emerge and for HERA it would result in a complete decoherence after a few orbital
damping times. So synchrotron motion is an essential ingredient.

display this < J (1)

(2.12) and σ0 = η0 = 0. The stochastic average < J (1)

few τdamp and with these parameters the sin2(λ

that with large σ0 and η0 the curve could approach < J (1)

2.6 The probability density of Process 2

2.6.1

Although Process 1 has led to most of the methods needed for problems of this kind it is too
idealized; in an electron storage ring it is not possible to have an initial state with deterministic
orbital values, i.e. sharp orbital values at the initial azimuth s = 0, and complete polarization
at the same azimuth since an injected beam or a beam at orbital equilibrium always occupies
a nonzero phase space volume.

Therefore in this section I consider another process, called ‘Process 2’, running with Machine
It is

I. It solves the Langevin equation (2.7) and fulﬁlls the standard boundary conditions.

However, in contrast to Process 1 the orbital variables are not deterministic at s = 0 but have a
Gaussian distribution with the ‘equilibrium’ probability density wnorm(σ, η), deﬁned in (2.74).
It describes an initial situation with complete polarization and orbital equilibrium. Denoting
the probability density of Process 2 by w2 one therefore has by (2.19), (2.23):

w2(σ, η, ψ; 0)

wnorm(σ, η)

This fulﬁlls (2.20) and by applying the orbital transition probability density one gets via (2.87)
the expected result that Process 2 is at ‘orbital equilibrium’, i.e. the orbital part w2,orb of w2
has the form

Thus for Process 2 the orbital variables remain in equilibrium, i.e. the orbital process

w2,orb = wnorm .

~z (2)(s)

Process 1.

One sees by (2.98) that σ2,33(0) = 0 as required and that σ2,33(s) approaches its equilibrium
value on the scale of the orbital damping time τdamp, so that the equilibrium polarization is
approached more slowly than for Process 1.

The polarization of Process 2 is displayed for the HERA values (2.12) in ﬁgure 3 for the ﬁrst
1000 turns where one sees that in contrast to Process 1 the spin equilibrium is reached only
after strong oscillations at the synchrotron frequency. The reason for the diﬀerence is clear. In
Process 2 the short time behaviour is dominated by synchrotron motion and the beam has a
prepared energy spread. The damping and diﬀusion act on a longer time scale. But in Process
1 there is no initial energy spread.

It is also interesting to study how the polarization would behave when starting with the
equilibrium orbital distribution but with no synchrotron radiation. I call this ‘Process 2a’. One
could use a solution based on the ﬁrst three terms on the rhs of (2.22) but it is more convenient
10−6. In
to use the result (2.100) in the limit where c, ω
→
this case the orbital phase space distribution remains unaltered but the damping and diﬀusion
forces have been turned oﬀ. 26 The resulting polarization is displayed in ﬁgure 4 where one
sees that the polarization never reaches equilibrium and continues to oscillate strongly at the
synchrotron frequency. So although the orbital distributions for processes 2 and 2a are identical
In
the spins behave very diﬀerently owing to the very diﬀerent ‘hidden’ orbital dynamics.
Process 2 the spin motion is irreversible.
In Process 2a the spins tend to ‘remember’ their
initial distribution.

This ﬁgure gives an impression of what could happen if one were considering protons and
is reminiscent of the long term polarization oscillations in ﬁgure 9 in [HH96]. In Appendix D
I consider the nature of the equilibrium distribution for ψ in the radiationless case in more
detail.

This completes the detailed account of the analytical derivation of the results for Machine
I discussed in [BBHMR94a, BBHMR94b]. I now continue with further developments of the
subject.

ization vector from a point in the orbital phase space. The standard boundary conditions of w
are taken into account in (2.103) via the integration range of ψ. Also one sees by (2.104) and
the ﬁniteness of the polarization vector that the polarization density obeys standard boundary
conditions in the variables σ, η.

Note that by (2.62), (2.103) the polarization density for Process 1 is given by:

There is an obvious connection between the radiationless Bloch equation (2.107) and the

Thomas-BMT equation (2.4a). In fact the s-dependent vector:

~P w(σ(s), η(s); s)

fulﬁlls (2.4a) because in the absence of radiation σ(s), η(s) fulﬁll the following equations of
motion:

σ′(s) = a

One easily sees that this connection between the radiationless Bloch equation and the Thomas-
BMT equation also holds if ~P w in (2.108) is replaced by any other quantity obeying (2.107).
An analogous connection holds for Machine II.

2.7.2

Just as for the Fokker-Planck equation, the Bloch equation (2.106) for the polarization density
also has a causal azimuthal evolution, i.e. an initial polarization density ~P w(σ, η; s0) determines

With the periodic boundary conditions discussed in section 2.3.6 one can express the polar-
ization density in terms of wper. By (2.103) the polarization density reads for the two forms

~P w(σ, η; s)

worb(σ, η, ψ; s)

~P w

As seen by (2.107), (2.120), in the absence of radiation the local polarization direction obeys

the same radiationless Bloch equation as the polarization density.

The chief virtue of the polarization density stems from the fact that it satisﬁes a universal and
linear diﬀerential equation (of the Bloch type). In the case of Machine I this equation is given
by (2.106). Furthermore this equation provides a causal azimuthal evolution but this feature
is not as important as universality and linearity.

One has seen that the local polarization vector and its direction also obey Bloch equations
but that these equations are not universal. Furthermore the equation for the local polarization
direction is in general nonlinear (see (2.120)). Clearly, in contrast to the full Fokker-Planck
equation (2.22), all these Bloch equations enable one to study average spin behaviour without
having to look closely at the ψ distribution wspin. The polarization density, the local polar-
ization vector and its direction only depend on orbital variables and the eﬀects of radiation
are contained in damping and diﬀusion terms of (2.106), (2.118), (2.120) which are associated
with the orbital Fokker-Planck operator LF P,orb. Indeed, it is no accident that Bloch equations
emerge for Machine I. See section 5.

I make further comments about Bloch equations in section 2.8.4.

2.8 The polarization properties of Machine I for G-processes

2.8.1

In this section I consider a special class of processes running with Machine I and one aim is to
consider the azimuthal evolution of the polarization vector.

I consider processes running with Machine I which have a general Gaussian probability

density in σ, η, ψ for s > s0. Thus for s > s0:

w(σ, η, ψ; s) = w(~x; s) = (2π)−3/2

where < ~x(s) > and σ denote the ﬁrst moment vector and covariance matrix of the process. I
call these ‘G-processes’. 30 Hence Process 2 is a G-process. By (2.27),(2.121) the characteristic
function Φ of a G-process reads as:

(2.122)

Because the ﬁrst moment vector and the covariance matrix depend continuously on s, (2.122)
holds even at s = s0, so that the characteristic function is especially convenient for those
G-processes whose covariance matrix is singular at s = s0.

Due to (2.26) the spin part wspin of w is also Gaussian for s > s0, i.e.:

By (2.47) the stochastic averages < σ(s) >, < η(s) > of the orbital variables have a causal
azimuthal evolution, i.e. they are determined by the initial values < σ(s0) >, < η(s0) >: 31

However, for the spin vector such a causal behaviour does not prevail and this already shows
up for G-processes.

By (2.124) one sees that two G-processes which have the same values for < ψ(s0) > and
σ33(s0) have the same initial polarization vector. However it does not follow from this that
both processes have the same polarization vector for s > s0, because by using the diﬀerential
equations (2.44), (2.45) and by using the freedom of choice of < σ(s0) >, < η(s0) >, σ11(s0),
σ12(s0), σ13(s0), σ22(s0), σ23(s0) one easily ﬁnds that the two processes in general have diﬀerent
polarization vectors for s > s0. This holds even if both processes are in the same orbital state,
i.e. have the same worb. As an example I compare the initial conditions:

< σ(s0) >=< η(s0) >=< ψ(s0) >= 0 ,
σ33(s0) = 2

where each set of initial conditions deﬁnes a speciﬁc G-process. Both processes are in orbital
equilibrium, so they are in the same orbital state with worb = wnorm. In particular they have
the same orbital stochastic averages < σ(s) >=< η(s) >= 0. Also both processes have same
initial polarization vector:

Hence the initial values < σ(s0) >, < η(s0) >, ~P w

tot(s0) do not determine the future behaviour
of the polarization vector. In particular there exists no diﬀerential equation for the azimuthal
evolution of the polarization vector, which could provide such a causal azimuthal evolution.
Indeed by diﬀerentiating (2.124) and by using (2.44), (2.45) one obtains for a G-process the

Concluding this section I have seen that, at least without further approximation, no (Bloch)

in equations (2.106), (2.137) have diﬀerent structures and that there is no diﬀusion term in
(2.137).

33In fact σinv(s) is positive deﬁnite for s > s0 because σ(s) is. From this it follows that: σinv,33(s) > 0 for

s > s0, which proves the assertion.

2.9 Miscellaneous equilibrium properties of Machine I

With the examples of processes 1,2 one has already seen that Machine I has no unique equilib-
rium state. Therefore in this section I study the asymptotic behaviour of arbitrary processes
running with Machine I.

To come to that I conclude ﬁrst of all from (2.79), (2.82), (2.86), (2.91):

The equilibrium probability density (2.138) is not the same for every process, reﬂecting the fact
that Machine I has no unique equilibrium state. From (2.138), (2.139) it is also clear that only
average 34 information about the initial state is needed in order to determine the corresponding
equilibrium state, i.e. for a given equilibrium state there are many diﬀerent initial states which
all approach the same equilibrium.

From (2.139) it follows that waver is normalized:

librium characterized by wnorm.

So at equilibrium the damping and diﬀusion balance each other and the Fokker-Planck equation
eﬀectively reduces to a Liouville equation, i.e. at equilibrium one eﬀectively has a Hamiltonian
ﬂow of the probability density. Furthermore, since Machine I is smooth, the asymptotic w is
independent of s so that ∂w/∂s = 0.

This is the equilibrium covariance matrix for an arbitrary process running with Machine I. One
sees that the (33)-element is simply determined by the initial covariance matrix. Stating it
diﬀerently: two processes running with Machine I have equilibrium covariance matrices which
can only diﬀer by the (33)-element. Of course, the equilibrium covariance matrices of processes
1 and 2 have the form (2.150). Also one ﬁnds that the equilibrium covariance matrices of the
processes deﬁned by (2.127), (2.128) are diﬀerent, conﬁrming the results of section 2.8.2.

Combining (2.155), (2.157) one observes that (2.153) holds so that I have proven that for
Machine I every stationary process fulﬁlls the condition of detailed balance.

For Machine I, as for many stochastic systems whose stationary states obey detailed balance,
the ‘Onsager relations’ [Gar85] hold. By these relations the covariance matrix σ for a stationary
process fulﬁlls:

ε

σ =

(cid:19)

(2.158)

In fact, the covariance matrix of a stationary process is the equilibrium covariance matrix and
the latter, given by (2.150), fulﬁlls the Onsager relations (2.158). This proves that the Onsager
relations hold for every stationary process of Machine I.

2.10 Resonant spin ﬂip

The study of Machine I was originally motivated by a wish to know whether it is possible to ﬂip
vertical polarization from up to down by perturbing the spins with an oscillating radial magnetic
ﬁeld running at a frequency close to ν and hence almost in resonance with the precession of
the spin basis ~m0,I(s),~l0,I(s), ~n0,I(s). My calculation suggests that for the smoothed machine
the horizontal spin components would partially decohere within a few orbital damping times.
Perhaps in reality there would be complete decoherence [BBHMR94a, BBHMR94b]. In any
case it looks as if the spin ﬂip procedure should be completed within a fraction of the orbital
damping time. However it must be bourne in mind that I have neglected the oscillating ﬁeld
in my calculations. I am pursuing this topic further.

2.11 Recapitulation of Machine I

Although the stochastic spin-orbit system of Machine I is very simple it has served to illustrate
the application of standard stochastic diﬀerential equation theory to such systems. Moreover,
this study is a useful introduction to the treatment of a more complicated system, namely
Machine II. To orient the reader I recapitulate the main results here:

For Machine I all processes reach equilibrium.

•

45

However the equilibrium is not unique.

•

•

•

•

•

•

There is no equation which provides a causal azimuthal evolution for the stochastic av-
erage of the ﬁve-component spin-orbit vector, i.e. there is no appropriate Bloch equation
for the polarization vector in Machine I.

But there is a universal Bloch equation which provides a causal azimuthal evolution for
the polarization density.

The Bloch equations for the local polarization vector and its direction provide causal
azimuthal evolution only under certain circumstances.

The value of the local polarization is uniform across phase space for Process 1 and G-
processes (e.g. Process 2).

There is an upper limit to the equilibrium polarization, namely the equilibrium value of
Process 1.

3 Machine II

3.1
In section 2 I studied the spin distribution w.r.t. a pair of (usually) nonperiodic vectors ( ~m0,~l0)
lying in the horizontal plane and found that this distribution always reaches equilibrium. How-
ever, this is not an equilibrium w.r.t. the directions ~e1, ~e2. On the contrary, the equilibrium
spin direction on the closed orbit is the ~n0-axis, i.e. that solution ~n0 to the Thomas-BMT
equation on the closed orbit which is 1-turn periodic in the machine frame and in Machine I
this is vertical. Thus it would be interesting to use my formalism to study spin diﬀusion w.r.t.
an equilibrium spin direction which is also constrained to lie in the horizontal plane. This can
be arranged by including a Siberian Snake [DK78] in the smoothed optic of Machine I to create
‘Machine II’. Siberian snakes are devices that rotate a spin on the closed orbit by an angle of
π around a ﬁxed axis which usually lies in the horizontal plane. With such a snake the ~n0-axis
is horizontal.

This layout is of great practical interest for some existing or proposed electron storage
rings (e.g the MIT-Bates, AmPs and BTCF rings) 37 where horizontal spin polarization is
required at the interaction points but whose energy is too low for a useful Sokolov-Ternov
[ST64] polarization rate to be achieved. These rings use Siberian Snakes to ensure that the
~n0-axis lies in the horizontal plane. A polarized electron beam is injected with its polarization
vector parallel to the ~n0-axis at the injection point and as well as determining the ~n0-axis the
snakes are supposed to suppress the spin diﬀusion that one naively expects when spins lie in
the horizontal plane so that useful polarization lifetimes can be achieved. 38

In this section I use my model to calculate the spin decoherence in the presence of a
pointlike snake whose rotation axis is radial 39 As we will see, this will allow a comparison

37See [Bar96] and the reference list therein.
38But recall from Machine I that it is not so clear that there will be complete depolarization.
39In the language of [Mon84] this is a ‘type 2’ snake. See section 6.3 thereof. The depolarization time

determined below (see eq. (3.64)) would be the same if the rotation axis were longitudinal.

with calculations using the SLIM formalism [Cha81] which is based on a linearized descrip-

3.3 The polarization density and its Bloch equation for Machine II

Fokker-Planck equation (3.9) one obtains:

∂ ~P w
∂s

= LF P,orb ~P w + ~WII ∧
which is the Bloch equation for Machine II w.r.t. the (~n0,II, ~m0,II,~l0,II)-frame. Writing it out

or (3.10) in analogy with (2.44), (2.45).

In this section I consider further properties arising for processes which are at orbital equilibrium,
i.e. for which worb = wnorm

43. Firstly:

Then from (3.14),(3.15) one gets:

< σ(s) >=< η(s) >= 0 .

< ψ′(s) >= 0 .

From (3.15),(3.16) follows:

The orbital matrix elements of the covariance matrix read as:

< ~x(s) > = (0, 0, < ψ(s0) >)T .

σ11 = σ2

σ ,

σ12 = σ21 = 0 ,

σ22 = σ2
η ,

so that the determinant of the covariance matrix is:

From this follows by using the diﬀerential equation (3.13):

By (3.17),(3.18), (3.24) one sees that the ﬁrst moment vector and the covariance matrix depend
continuously on s. However the dependence is not smooth because the discontinuity of ˆd(s) at
s = NL causes (see (3.22)) σ′

23(s) to be discontinuous at s = NL (N=integer).

In addition to the Bloch equation for the polarization density, at orbital equilibrium a Bloch

equation for the local polarization vector holds. In fact from (2.74), (2.115), (3.11) follows:

In the remainder of section 3 I study three diﬀerent G-processes at orbital equilibrium which
I call processes 3,4,5. 44 For Machine II G-processes are deﬁned as for Machine I; see section
2.8. Moreover by (3.18) the inverse σinv of the covariance matrix fulﬁlls:

Naturally one could describe processes 3,4 and 5 with the aid of the Bloch equations (3.11),
(3.25), (3.33) which one would solve by standard methods (e.g. using Green functions or
method of characteristics) but for such simple G-processes the ﬁrst and second moments are
easily obtained, so that on this occasion the Bloch equations are not needed.

3.5 The probability density of Process 3

Now I consider the process ~x(3)(s), called ‘Process 3’ and I abbreviate:



≡ 



This process is characterized by the following three conditions:

It is a G-process at orbital equilibrium and its starting azimuth is s0 = 0.

The initial local polarization direction is parallel to the ~n0-axis of Machine II.

Its initial local polarization is 1.

By the second and third conditions one has:

~P w3

where the probability density of Process 3 is denoted by w3. Thus one has by (3.29), (3.30):

where the covariance matrix of Process 3 is denoted by σ3 and where:

m being an arbitrary integer. 45 From the ﬁrst condition on Process 3 and from (3.19), (3.36),
(3.37) it follows that:

Also from (3.17), (3.35) follows:

By (3.32), (3.35) one obtains:

< ~x(3)(s) >=< ~x(3)(0) >= (0, 0, ψ0,m)T .

G-process, and one obtains for s > 0:

By (3.43), (3.44) w3 fulﬁlls the normalization condition (2.20). Also it follows for the orbital
part of w3 that:

w3,orb = wnorm ,

conﬁrming that Process 3 is at orbital equilibrium. Note that ~x(3)(s) is a Markovian diﬀusion
process.

3.5.2

Now I continue the calculation of the covariance matrix σ3 of Process 3 and by (3.13) this is
basically an integration problem. In this section I determine the matrix elements σ3,13, σ3,23
which fulﬁll the diﬀerential equation (3.22). To do this I ﬁrst obtain a 2-turn periodic special
solution (denoted by (g7, g8)) of (3.22), i.e.

g′
7
g′
8 !

=

 

Aorb ·  

g7
g8 !

+ σ2

η ·

ˆd !

.

Because the diﬀerence of two such solutions solves the homogeneous equation corresponding to
(3.45) one observes that (g7, g8) is unique since the 2-turn periodic solution to the homogeneous
equation vanishes. 47 I can then write:

σ3,13(s)
σ3,23(s) ! ≡  

g7(s)
g8(s) !

+

 

g9(s)
g10(s) !

,

 

where (g9, g10) is a solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation, i.e.

With (3.47) one ﬁnds that after a few orbital damping times g9, g10 fade away so that by (3.46)
σ3,13(s), σ3,23(s) become 2-turn periodic in s. Hence after a few orbital damping times one gets:

g′

Aorb ·  

g9

.

σ3,13(s)
σ3,23(s) ! ≈

.

 

One ﬁnds that (g7, g8) is given explicitly by:

One sees by (3.59) that after a few orbital damping times g16 becomes constant so that by
(3.56) g13 becomes constant, too. Also one observes that g14(s) is 1-turn periodic in s because
s is 1-turn periodic in s. Hence after a few orbital damping times one

obeys:

This completes the calculation of the covariance matrix, whose matrix elements are given

which corresponds to 12000 turns, i.e. about 260 milliseconds. If on the other hand Qs (and
therefore λ) were close to half of an integer g15 would, because of its factor g11, become very
large and τspin would be very small. This is exactly what one expects when sitting close to a
spin-orbit resonance [BHMR91].

Process 3 is a rough model for the behaviour of the polarization after injection into the
rings mentioned in section 3.1 and it is therefore interesting to study the transient behaviour
in (3.62). To come to that I study the complicated azimuthal dependence of the polarization
‘turn by turn’, i.e. I consider its behaviour with increasing number of turns and thus investigate
the sequence σ3,33(2NL), where N is a nonnegative integer. My ‘observation point’ is at the
azimuth s = 2NL, i.e. at the snake after every second turn. 48

First of all one gets

48I consider the sequence σ3,33(2N L) instead of σ3,33(N L) because of mathematical convenience.

σ3,33(2NL) = g13(2NL) + g14(2NL) + 2NL

All transient behaviour is contained in the ﬁrst factor on the rhs of (3.68) and as one has
seen this term converges to a ﬁnite value after a few orbital damping times. Unfortunately,
polarimeters are usually not fast enough to measure the transients. To look at σ3,33,inter(2NL)

term dominates the polarization. However the intermediate term is so small that it never
seriously degrades the polarization. The strongest eﬀect is a degradation of the polarization
value to 0.93 after 8 turns. This can be seen in ﬁgure 7 where the polarization is displayed
for the ﬁrst 1000 turns. The polarization is also displayed for the ﬁrst 20000 turns in ﬁgure
8. Finally in ﬁgure 9 the polarization is displayed for the limiting case, where c, ω

within narrow limits. This is a kind of spin echo eﬀect [Abr61].

Comparing ﬁgure 7 and ﬁgure 8 with ﬁgure 3 one also sees that for the ﬁrst few thousands of
turns the polarization of Process 3 is much larger than for Process 2 showing that as expected
the snake can strongly suppress oscillations in the spin distribution. However, and this is at ﬁrst
unexpected when recalling the equilibrium reached by Process 2, in the end there is complete
decoherence for Process 3. But, on the other hand, one should not be surprised when one recalls
that the calculations with SLIM [Cha81] for a perfectly aligned ﬂat ring with a pointlike radial
snake in which only spin diﬀusion due to synchrotron motion generated in the arcs is included,
also predict complete depolarization [Bar97]. Similar calculations also show that spin diﬀusion
due to horizontal betatron motion in the arcs is very much less than that due to synchrotron
motion.

Another illustration of the transient behaviour of Process 3 is provided by calculating the
polarization after one turn. During the ﬁrst turn Process 3 is identical to Process 2 so that by

The local polarization starts from the value 1 at s = 0 and decreases towards its vanishing
equilibrium value.

With the local polarization quantities at hand one can reconsider the transient behaviour of
Process 3 in more detail. After a few orbital damping times the transient behaviour disappears
so that the local polarization quantities acquire certain periodicity properties w.r.t. s. In fact
from section 3.5.2 it is clear that on this time scale σ3,13(s), σ3,23(s) become 2-turn periodic in
s and change sign from turn to turn:

g7(s) =

g7(s + L) ,

g8(s) =

g8(s + L) .

−

−

Hence by (3.72) the local polarization direction becomes 2-turn periodic in s in the
(~n0,II, ~m0,II,~l0,II)-frame. Since in the machine frame ~m0,II also changes sign from turn to turn,
the local polarization direction becomes 1-turn periodic in the machine frame after a few orbital
damping times. Note that at the phase space point where σ = σσ and η = ση and for the HERA
values (2.12) the ~n0-axis deviates at the snake by about 200 milliradians from the asymptotic
local polarization direction.

Moreover in section 3.5.3 I observed that σ3,33(s) quickly splits up additively into a term
increasing linearly with s plus a term 1-turn periodic in s. Hence by (3.71) the local polarization
factors into an exponentially decaying part and a part 1-turn periodic in s. 50

I now round oﬀ section 3 by considering two processes with contrasting transient behaviour,
one of which shows no transients and one which will turn out to illustrate very nicely the
validity of a tenet at the basis of the standard method of calculating the rate of depolarization.
Both processes are G-processes at orbital equilibrium.

3.6 The probability density of Process 4

3.6.1

free process.

For Process 3 I found that during the ﬁrst few orbital damping times transient behaviour
prevents an exponential decay of the polarization. Knowing this it is now simple to deﬁne a
modiﬁcation of Process 3 which shows no transient behaviour of the polarization properties at
any s and which from the beginning has those periodicity properties which Process 3 acquires
50In fact one can use these properties of the local polarization and its direction as the deﬁnition of a transient

63

only after a few orbital damping times. For this process ~x(4)(s), called ‘Process 4’, the expo-
nential decay of the polarization shows up right from the beginning because no transient terms
destroy the exponential structure. I abbreviate:



Process 4 is characterized by the following four conditions:

σ(4)(s)
η(4)(s)
ψ(4)(s)

.



~x(4)(s)

≡ 



It is a G-process at orbital equilibrium and its starting azimuth is s0 = 0.

The direction of the local polarization is 2-turn periodic in s in the (~n0,II, ~m0,II,~l0,II)-frame
and 1-turn periodic in the machine frame.

The direction of the local polarization on the closed orbit is parallel to the ~n0-axis of
Machine II.

•

•

•

•

Its initial local polarization is 1.

The second condition ensures that the process is free of transients.

By the third condition one has:

~P w4

dir (0, 0; s) = 






< ψ(4)(0) >= ψ0,m ,

(3.74)

(3.75)

(3.76)

(3.77)

where the probability density of Process 4 is denoted by w4. Thus one has by (3.30), (3.74):

where ψ0,m is given by (3.38). From (3.17), (3.75) follows:

< ~x(4)(s) >=< ~x(4)(0) >= (0, 0, ψ0,m)T .

Also, due to the second condition on Process 4 one observes by (3.30) that σ4,13(s), σ4,23(s) are 2-
turn periodic in s, where σ4 denotes the covariance matrix of Process 4. Because σ4,13(s), σ4,23(s)
obey (3.22) and are 2-turn periodic in s, one concludes by section 3.5.2 that:

σ4,13(s)
σ4,23(s) !

where g7, g8 are given by (3.49).

With (3.18), (3.76), (3.77), (3.81) I have determined the ﬁrst moment vector and the covariance

Therefore to prove that the above construction constitutes a G-process I just have to show that
the covariance matrix is nonsingular for s > 0. This can be done in analogy to Process 3. In

Hence by (3.83) σ4 is nonsingular for s > 0, conﬁrming that Process 4 is a G-process. Thus the
probability density reads for s > 0 as:

The observed periodicity properties of the local polarization quantities of Process 4 show

Applying this to (3.30) one sees that on this time scale the direction of the local polarization

Hence after a few orbital damping times one ﬁnds that the local polarization of Process 3 is
proportional to the local polarization of Process 4. One thus sees that the local polarization, as
well as the polarization, is the product of a 1-turn periodic factor and an exponentially decaying

68

factor with the same depolarization rate 1/τspin as was observed for the long term behaviour
of Process 3. Furthermore the polarization densities are proportional:

In this section I consider the process ~x(5)(s), called ‘Process 5’, whose initial state was used in
several studies of the past [DK72, BHMR91]. I abbreviate:



Process 5 is characterized by the following three conditions:

σ(5)(s)
η(5)(s)
ψ(5)(s)

.



~x(5)(s)

≡ 



It is a G-process at orbital equilibrium and its starting azimuth is s0 = 0.

The direction of the initial local polarization is given by the ~n-axis of Machine II [DK72,
HH96].

Its initial local polarization is 1.

69

For my two-dimensional orbital phase space the ~n-axis, denoted by ~nII (see Appendix B), is a
unit-vector periodic solution of the radiationless Bloch equation (B.1) satisfying the condition:

~nII(σ, η; s) = ~nII(σ, η; s + L) ,

51

in the machine frame and it is a key component of the standard method for calculating the
rate of depolarization by perturbation theory in real rings.
In the absence of radiation
an ensemble, for which the local polarization direction is parallel to the ~n-axis and for which
the local polarization equals 1, remains in this state. See the discussion in [HH96]. 52 In the
presence of radiation it is usually assumed [DK73, Man87, BHMR91] that the local polarization
direction remains parallel to the ~n-axis at each point in phase space and it is this assumption
that provides a way to calculate the depolarization rate for real rings using perturbation theory.
In this section I will use my exact analytical methods to check these assumptions for Machine II
and to show analytically that in the absence of radiation an ensemble initially polarized along
the ~n-axis is in spin equilibrium.

Process 5 diﬀers from Process 4 by the second condition. By the ﬁrst condition one has via

(3.17):

< ~x(5)(s) >=< ~x(5)(0) >= (0, 0, < ψ(5)(0) >)T .

(3.97)

A constraint on < ψ(5)(0) > will be derived below using the second condition.

Because of the ﬁrst condition on Process 5 I can apply (3.29),(3.30) by which one gets:

Bloch equation (3.12) and satisﬁes the condition

ˆ~nII (σ, η; s) = ˆ~nII (σ, η; s + 2L) .

52Note that in this treatment the ~n-axis enters the picture as the periodic solution of the radiationless Bloch
equation. This is in contrast to other treatments, where the ~n-axis appears in the diagonalization of the
combined spin-orbit Hamiltonian (see Appendix D) [DK73, Yok86, BHR94b]. For the relation of the ~n-axis to
the Thomas-BMT equation, see section 2.7.1.

(3.18), (3.105), (3.109), (3.112) I have determined the ﬁrst moment vector and the covariance
matrix of Process 5. By (3.32), (3.102) the characteristic function Φ5 corresponding to w5 reads

Therefore to prove that the above construction constitutes a G-process I just have to show that
the covariance matrix is nonsingular for s > 0. This can be done analogously to processes 3

for s > 0 the probability density reads as:

where I used (3.69). This converges after a few orbital damping times to a constant whereas
σ3,33(2NL) grows exponentially.
It is now clear that processes 3,4 and 5 all have the same
depolarization time τspin and the same asymptotic local polarization direction. 53

A plot of the azimuthal dependence of the polarization for Process 5 for the HERA values
(2.12) is visually indistinguishable from the plot in ﬁgure 10 for Process 4 and is therefore not

presented here.
be seen in ﬁgure 12 where I plot the diﬀerence. This is tiny and shows oscillating transient
behaviour which must be due to transient behaviour in Process 5 since Process 4 is transient
free. In ﬁgure 13 I plot the azimuthal dependence of the angle between the local polarization
direction of processes 4 and 5 at the phase space point where σ = σσ and η = ση. One again sees
oscillating transient behaviour with an angle diﬀerence of typically 0.05 milliradians whereas
the angle between the ~n0-axis and the ~n-axis at the same point is about 200 milliradians.

The interpretation of these ﬁndings is straightforward; although, as discussed above, the
~n-axis should give the local polarization direction in the absence of radiation, this is no longer
exactly true in the presence of radiation. We have already seen for Process 3 that when
the initial polarization direction deviates typically by 200 milliradians from the asymptotic
local polarization direction, polarization ﬂuctuations of several percent occur which eventually
damp away while at the same time the local polarization direction approaches its asymptotic
distribution. A similar thing happens with Process 5 except that the diﬀerence between the
~n-axis and the asymptotic local polarization direction is very small so that the polarization
ﬂuctuations are correspondingly small.
It can be shown using (3.90), (B.2) that the angle
between the ~n-axis and the asymptotic local polarization direction at the phase space point
where σ = σσ and η = ση is given at the snake by:

54Note that the initial polarization of processes 4 and 5 is not complete because the initial direction of the

local polarization is not uniform - see (3.90),(3.103).

Thus I have shown that the ~n-axis does not describe the direction of the local polarization in
Machine II in the presence of radiation. However, the relative diﬀerence in the directions is
extremely small and can, for practical purposes be ignored for Machine II.

The depolarization rate obtained using SLIM [Cha81] for a real perfectly aligned ﬂat HERA
lattice with a pointlike radial snake and when only spin diﬀusion due to synchrotron motion
generated in the arcs is included, is in satisfactory agreement with τ −1

spin [Bar97].

As one can see from (B.8), the SLIM approximation to the ~n-axis is quite good near phase
space points where σ = σσ and η = ση. However, it becomes progressively worse towards the
edges of phase space.

In the absence of radiation the local polarization direction should be parallel to the ~n-
axis and the polarization of an ensemble in orbital equilibrium set up in this state should be
constant from turn to turn. This can be conﬁrmed analytically by putting c and ω to zero with
10−6, in which limit Process 5 modiﬁes to ‘Process 5a’. Using

which is indeed constant from turn to turn. Also the local polarization is constant from turn to
turn. For the HERA values (2.12) this expression gives about 0.98. It also coincides with the
constant polarization seen in Process 4a. One can now see why the polarization of Process 4a is
constant from turn to turn; if, as in Process 4, I require that the local polarization direction is
already asymptotic at s = 0 and switch oﬀ the radiation, this local polarization direction must
coincide with the ~n-axis since it now fulﬁlls the characteristic properties of the ~n-axis. Then,
just as in Process 5a, the polarization must be constant from turn to turn and Process 4a is
identical with Process 5a.

3.8 The polarization density and spin matching for Machine II

Although the synchrotron radiation parameters c and ω are s-independent the present formalism
can be used to analyze more complex rings. For example, the Green function for the polarization
density, in particular the radiationless Green function, can be used to analyze the eﬀect of
‘lumped’ radiators such as asymmetric wigglers [Mon84]. 55 If, for example, a wiggler is placed
diametrically opposite the snake, then one expects on the basis of standard ‘spin matching’
concepts that the spin diﬀusion due to the extra excitation of η would be almost cancelled
[BKRRS85]. This can be made quantitative by considering the ‘G matrix’, the 2
6 spin-orbit
coupling matrix of the SLIM formalism. Writing this in the form

×

G = (g x, g z, g s) ,

where the g’s are 2
s = L/2 to s = 3L/2 in Machine II is:

(3.123)
55Asymmetric wigglers can be designed so that the overall spin phase advance is zero and so that no dispersion

is generated overall.

(cid:19) · 


76

The nonzero matrix elements of g s vanish as λ0 goes to zero and then in linear approximation
a spin travelling from s = L/2 to s = 3L/2 on any synchrotron orbit is unperturbed overall.
This interval is then said to be ‘spin transparent’ and the depolarization due to the wiggler
is cancelled. For the HERA values (2.12) g s does not exactly vanish but since Qs is small
g s is still small enough to ensure that the depolarization due to the wiggler should be largely
suppressed.

However, in realistic machines like HERA, there is still excitation in the remainder of the
ring. So even if the radiation power from the wiggler were dominant, the radiation in the
remainder of the ring would still cause depolarization on the ‘time’ scale τspin. These conjectures
are conﬁrmed by numerical calculations with SLIM [Bar97].

Spin transparency can be discussed using the polarization density. Since in this section I
am only considering the radiation from the wiggler, this condition can be investigated using
the polarization density for the radiationless case. The causality properties of the azimuthal
evolution for Machine II are the same as for Machine I, so that in particular one has a Green
function for the polarization density. For the radiationless case the Green function P II,nrad for
the radiationless Bloch equation (3.12) is given by:

4 Summary

The spin depolarization rate in an electron storage ring is usually calculated using standard
algorithms like SLIM or a Monte-Carlo tracking program such as SITROS [Kew83, Boe94].
SLIM exploits the Derbenev-Kondratenko (DK) formula 56 and a ﬁrst order perturbation theory.
Methods based on the DK formalism are only applicable once various transient phenomena
have damped away. In this paper I have shown how one can, instead, apply standard Fokker-
Planck methods, but to very simple model rings. In the process I introduced the polarization
density, a quantity which obeys a universal evolution equation of the Bloch type. This is a
linear equation valid for arbitrary spin distributions and can therefore be used far from orbital
and/or spin equilibrium. I also introduced the local polarization vector and its direction. Both
obey Bloch type evolution equations which depend on the orbital state and are therefore not
universal.

In the numerical part of this report I have used the parameters (2.12) of a typical ring,
namely the HERA electron ring, to study the short and long term behaviour of nine diﬀerent
scenarios, the stochastic Processes 1,2,3,4 and 5 and the noise free processes 2a, 3a, 4a and 5a. It
is found that Processes 1 and 2 do not lead to complete spin decoherence and the corresponding
equilibrium polarization is calculated. However in the presence of a Siberian Snake (processes
3,4 and 5) there is complete spin decoherence, a result which is to some extent counter intuitive
given that snakes tend to stabilize the polarization. The asymptotic depolarization rates agree
with SLIM estimates and in the presence of radiation the asymptotic local polarization direction
is not exactly parallel to the ~n-axis. The radiationless Green function for the polarization
density oﬀers another tool for studying spin matching. In processes 2a and 3a the polarization
oscillates indeﬁnitely but in processes 4a and 5a, the spin distribution begins in equilibrium
and remains there.

The models considered here are extremely simple but in the next section I indicate how the
polarization density (and the local polarization vector and its direction) can be used in realistic
cases.

5 Epilogue

This paper is the ﬁrst part of a paper prepared in 1995 but not distributed. In the second part
I demonstrate that the polarization density deﬁned on a six-dimensional orbital phase space
for full three-dimensional spin motion also obeys a universal evolution equation of Bloch type
with the same linear structure as equations (2.106), (3.11), namely

∂ ~P w
∂s

~P w ,

= LF P,orb,gen ~P w + ~Wgen ∧
where LF P,orb,gen denotes the orbital Fokker-Planck operator and where the vector ~Wgen is
determined by the Thomas-BMT equation.
In the more general formulation I use periodic
boundary conditions for the spin phase. 57 The polarization density is appropriate for use with
arbitrarily complicated rings. The local polarization vector and its direction are also useful
tools (especially at orbital equilibrium) and by using these and their Bloch equations I obtain
56Other algorithms exploiting the DK approach, but at higher order, are SMILE [Man87] and SODOM

[Yok92].

By calculating the depolarization rate for Machine II in terms of
the 1/τspin of (3.63). In fact the derivation of the Bloch equation for the general polarization
density constitutes a classical construction for the pure depolarization part of equation 2 in
[DK75] which was obtained by semiclassical methods. Using the polarization density one can
estimate the angle between the ~n-axis and the true local polarization direction in practical
rings. The Sokolov-Ternov process can be included by adding in parts of the Baier-Katkov-
Strakovenko expression [BKS70] in an obvious way. One then has many of the terms in equation
2 in [DK75]. The remaining terms can only be obtained by a full semiclassical treatment of the
radiation process and this work is in progress and will be published at a later date together
with the classical work on the general polarization density.

Appendix A

In this appendix I show that the Thomas-BMT equation (3.6) for Machine II, deﬁned in the
rotating frame ~n0,II, ~m0,II,~l0,II of section 3.1, follows from (3.1). First of all I have to show that
the vectors ~m0,II(s),~l0,II(s), ~n0,II(s) solve the closed orbit Thomas-BMT equation:

Appendix B

In this appendix I calculate the ~n-axis of Machine II. 59 As mentioned in section 3.7.1 the ~n-axis
is denoted by ~nII and it obeys the following radiationless Bloch equation:

In fact, (B.1) holds because in the (~n0,II, ~m0,II,~l0,II)-frame the ~n-axis obeys the radiationless
Bloch equation (3.12).

I begin by assuming that the ~n-axis is horizontal, so that I make the ansatz:

where fII(σ, η; s) needs to be determined. Then with the ansatz that fII is linear in σ, η one
ﬁnally gets

In this section I show that ~nII, as deﬁned by (B.2),(B.3),(B.4) fulﬁlls all properties of an ~n-axis.

reads at the snake as:

It is easily checked that this expression solves (B.5). One also observes by (B.3),(B.4) that:

(B.5)

(B.6)

lim
0<s→0

[fII(σ, η; s)] =

lim
0>s→0

−

[fII(σ, η; s)] .

From this follows by (A.3),(B.2):

lim
0<s→0

[~nII(σ, η; s)] = M snake ·

lim
0>s→0

[~nII(σ, η; s)] ,

so that ~nII obeys (B.6) at the snake. One also sees that fII(σ, η; s), given by (B.3), is 1-turn
periodic in s.

Thus I have shown that ~nII(σ, η; s), given by (B.2), (B.3), is a unit-vector solution of the
radiationless Bloch equation (B.1), 1-turn periodic in s in the machine frame. It is thus the
vector ﬁeld ~n of [DK72, HH96].

Note that for σ = η = 0 one gets:

~nII(σ = 0, η = 0; s) = ~n0,II(s) .

One also observes that with this ansatz a singularity in ~nII occurs if the fractional part of the
orbital tune Qs = (λ0 ·

L)/(2π) equals 1/2, i.e. if one is at a spin-orbit resonance.

Appendix C

In this Appendix I brieﬂy reconsider Machine I by extending it to ‘Machine III’ which is
obtained by including the nonhorizontal component of the spin vector, i.e. by considering the
full three-dimensional spin motion. For horizontal spin the dynamics of Machine III is the same
as for Machine I.

As for Machine I I denote the spin vector in the ( ~m0,I,~l0,I, ~n0,I)-frame by ~S. To cover the
full three-dimensional spin motion one can employ, as mentioned in section 2.3.6, spherical
coordinates, so that:

~S

where ψ, θ denote the azimuthal and polar angles. The horizontal spin vector (2.3) can be
obtained from (C.1) by setting θ = π/2. Thus for θ = π/2 Machine III eﬀectively reduces to
Machine I.

In dealing with 4 variables, the processes to be studied for Machine III are denoted by ~y(s),

compared with ~x(s) they have an additional component. The Langevin equation for

i.e.
Machine III is then deﬁned by:

Appendix D

D.1

In section 2.9 I observed that the equilibrium behaviour of Machine I in the presence of radiation
resembles a Hamiltonian ﬂow. In this appendix I now brieﬂy reconsider Machine I by switching
oﬀ the radiation eﬀects to obtain a real Hamiltonian ﬂow. I call this model ‘Machine IV’. The
aim is to investigate the existence of an equilibrium spin distribution and to do that I adopt
the usual approach of describing the system in terms of action-angle variables. Since I use a

85

(D.1)

(D.2)

(D.3)

(D.4)

canonical formalism I need an even number of variables. Hence I supplement σ, η, ψ by a fourth
variable J, canonically conjugate to ψ, which is deﬁned by:

where θ denotes the polar angle in the spherical coordinate expression (2.33) of the spin vector
~S. 60 Thus for Machine IV the spin vector in the ( ~m0,I,~l0,I, ~n0,I)-frame is parametrized as:

J

Hence, as for Machine III, I consider the full three-dimensional spin motion, i.e. the nonhori-
zontal component of the spin vector is included. One sees that the additional variable describes
the projection of the spin onto the vertical direction so that for processes running with Machine
I one has: J = 0. But owing to the ﬁeld geometry in Machine I one could have carried through
the analysis with nonzero J if I had only been interested in the ψ distribution. The Poisson
brackets are deﬁned by [DK73, Yok86, BHR94a, BHR94b] 61:

and the Hamiltonian reads as:

·

≡

Horb + Hspin ,

where Horb is deﬁned in section 2.5 and:

·

·

Due to the absence of radiation the Langevin equation for Machine IV reduces to the following
canonical equations of motion:

σ′ = a

η + d

J ,

η′ = b

σ ,

ψ′ = d

η ,

J ′ = 0 .

(D.5)

·

·
One sees that Hspin contributes a (very small) Stern-Gerlach term [BHR94a, BHR94b] appear-
ing in the ﬁrst identity of (D.5) which was neglected for Machine I because this Stern-Gerlach
eﬀect vanishes at J = 0.

·

·

Thus Machine III, unlike Machine IV, is lacking the Stern-Gerlach force and Machine IV,
unlike Machine III, is lacking radiation eﬀects. Both machines involve the full three-dimensional
spin motion but they parametrize it in diﬀerent ways.

60Note that for Machine III (see Appendix C) the variable θ is used instead of J.
61Note that because of (D.1),(D.3) I use units in Appendix D where ¯h has the dimension of length [BHR94a,

BHR94b].

86

Coming to the probability density, I now adopt boundary conditions for the variables ψ, J
which are natural for their role as spherical coordinates. In particular I adopt for ψ the periodic
boundary conditions mentioned in section 2.3.6. The probability density in the present case also
depends on J and I denote it by wmod,a. The normalization condition (2.35) for wper translates
by using (D.1) into:

To investigate the matter of equilibrium with the help of the evolution equation (D.8) I trans-
form to action-angle variables. To come to these I ﬁrst replace σ, η by the orbital variables
φ, Jorb deﬁned in section 2.5. Thus I treat my system using the variables φ, Jorb, ψ, J with the
Poisson brackets:

This Hamiltonian is not yet in action-angle form since it still contains the phase φ. The

wmod,b(φ, Jorb, ψ, J; s)

wmod,a(σ, η, ψ, J; s) .

Note that wmod,b is periodic in φ, ψ with period 2π. For the ﬁnal step in obtaining the action-
angle variables I use the spin-orbit action-angle formalism of [DK73, Yok86, BHR]. This allows
one to perform the following canonical transformation 62

and since it now only contains an action I ﬁnally have the desired form. Note that this Hamil-
tonian does not contain the spin action Jnew. Note also that ψnew is identical to ˜ψ in section
2.2. Thus one sees that this canonical transformation which has removed the spin dependence
from the Hamiltonian is equivalent to the reduction from a three-dimensional problem to a
two-dimensional problem observed by (2.17b). This reduction reﬂects the nonuniqueness of the
equilibrium state already observed in section 2 in the presence of radiation eﬀects. Denoting
the probability density in these variables by wmod,c one gets:

(D.14)

wmod,c(φnew, Jorb,new, ψnew, Jnew; s) = wmod,b(φ, Jorb, ψ, J; s) .

(D.15)

Note that wmod,c is periodic in φnew, ψnew with period 2π. The corresponding Liouville equation
reads as:

∂wmod,c
∂s

=

Hc, wmod,c}

{

.

(D.16)

D.4

Having obtained action-angle variables one now can discuss equilibrium. I deﬁne ‘equilibrium’
to mean that ∂wmod,c/∂s is zero. Then by (D.16) the Poisson bracket
vanishes.
Since Hc is independent of φnew the probability density wmod,c must be independent of φnew.
However, since (D.14) does not contain Jnew the probability density wmod,c can still depend
on ψnew. The interpretation of this is that since the ψnew for each particle is constant (see
(2.17b)), the ψnew distribution does not change as s increases and is therefore in equilibrium.
So although I have a complete transformation to action-angle variables the special form for the
Hamiltonian (D.14) means that by insisting on equilibrium one cannot say very much about
the ψnew distribution except that wmod,c has the form

Hc, wmod,c}

{

wmod,c(φnew, Jorb,new, ψnew, Jnew; s) = wmod,c(Jorb,new, ψnew, Jnew) ,

(D.17)

so that wmod,c neither depends on φnew nor on s. The dependence of wmod,c on ψnew reﬂects
the nonuniqueness of the equilibrium state already observed in section 2 in the presence of
radiation eﬀects. If on the contrary the Hamiltonian had contained Jnew the ψnew distribution
would have had to be uniform. In the case of horizontal spin one has J = 0 so that by (D.12d)
one has: Jnew = 0. Then (D.17) simpliﬁes to:

wmod,c(Jorb,new, ψnew, Jnew)

wrest(Jorb,new, ψnew)

δ(Jnew) ,

(D.18)

≡

·

where wrest neither depends on φnew, Jnew nor on s.

63The above action-angle formalism neglects higher orders in ¯h in a speciﬁc way which is made use of in

(D.13).

The s-dependence of the ﬁrst moment of the variables σ, η allows one to deﬁne a damping time
for every process. It turns out that this ‘orbital damping time’ is independent of the process.
It is the same for machines I and II since they have the same orbital equations of motion.

Also it is shown how the orbital damping time is involved in the orbital correlation matrix

(deﬁned below).

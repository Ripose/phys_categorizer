Abstract
We present ﬁrst observation of Self-Ampliﬁed Spontaneous
Emission (SASE) in a free-electron laser (FEL) in the Vac-
uum Ultraviolet regime at 109 nm wavelength (11 eV). The
observed free-electron laser gain (approx. 3000) and the ra-
diation characteristics, such as dependency on bunch charge,
angular distribution, spectral width and intensity ﬂuctuations
all corroborate the present models for SASE FELs.

I. INTRODUCTION

X-ray lasers are expected to open up new and excit-
ing areas of basic and applied research in biology, chem-
istry and physics. Due to recent progress in accelera-
tor technology the attainment of the long sought-after
goal of wide-range tunable laser radiation in the Vacuum-
Ultraviolet and X-ray spectral regions is coming close to
realization with the construction of free-electron lasers
(FEL) [1] based on the principle of Self-Ampliﬁed Spon-
taneous Emission (SASE) [2,3]. In a SASE FEL lasing
occurs in a single pass of a relativistic, high-quality elec-
tron bunch through a long undulator magnet structure.
The radiation wavelength λph of the ﬁrst harmonic of
FEL radiation is related to the period length λu of a
planar undulator by

λph =

λu

2γ2 (cid:18)1 +

K 2

2 (cid:19)

(1)

where γ = E/(mec2) is the relativistic factor of the elec-
trons, K = eBuλu/(2πmec2) the undulator parameter
and Bu the peak magnetic ﬁeld in the undulator. Equa-
tion (1) exhibits two main advantages of the free-electron
laser: the free tunability of the wavelength by changing
the electron energy and the possibility to achieve very
short radiation wavelengths.

For most FELs presently in operation [4], the electron
beam quality and the undulator length result in a gain of
only a few percent per undulator passage, so that an opti-
cal cavity resonator and a synchronized multi-bunch elec-
tron beam have to be used. At very short wavelengths,
normal-incidence mirrors of high reﬂectivity are unavail-
able. Therefore the generation of an electron beam of
extremely high quality in terms of emittance, peak cur-
rent and energy spread, and a high precision undulator of
suﬃcient length are essential. Provided the spontaneous
radiation from the ﬁrst part of the undulator overlaps
the electron beam, the electromagnetic radiation inter-
acts with the electron bunch leading to a density mod-
ulation (micro-bunching) which enhances the power and
coherence of radiation. In this “high gain mode” [5–7],
the radiation power P (z) grows exponentially with the
distance z along the undulator

P (z) = APin exp(2z/Lg)

(2)

where Lg is the ﬁeld gain length, Pin the eﬀective input
power (see below), and A the input coupling factor [6,7].
A is equal to 1/9 in one-dimensional FEL theory with an
ideal electron beam. Typical parameters for a SASE FEL
operating in the VUV wavelength range are: Pin of about
a few Watts and power gain at saturation, G = Psat/Pin,
of about 108.

Since the desired wavelength is very short, there is
no laser tunable over a wide range to provide the in-
put power Pin. Instead, the spontaneous undulator ra-
diation from the ﬁrst part of the undulator is used as
an input signal to the downstream part. FELs based on
this Self-Ampliﬁed-Spontaneous-Emission (SASE) prin-
ciple are presently considered the most attractive can-
didates for delivering extremely brilliant, coherent light
with wavelength in the ˚Angstr¨om regime [8–11]. Com-
pared to state-of-the-art synchrotron radiation sources,
one expects full transverse coherence, up to 4-6 orders of
magnitude larger average brilliance, and up to 8-10 or-
ders of magnitude larger peak brilliance at pulse lengths
of about 200 fs FWHM. Recently there have been impor-
tant advances in demonstrating a high-gain SASE FEL
at 12 µm wavelength [12] and at 530 nm wavelength [13].

II. EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP

The experimental results presented in this paper
have been achieved at the TESLA Test Facility (TTF)
Free-Electron Laser [14] at the Deutsches Elektronen-
Synchrotron DESY. The TESLA (TeV-Energy Supercon-
ducting Linear Accelerator) collaboration consists of 39
institutes from 9 countries and aims at the construction
of a 500 GeV (center-of-mass) e+/e− linear collider with
an integrated X-ray laser facility [10]. Major hardware
contributions to TTF have come from Germany, France,
Italy, and the USA. The goal of the TTF FEL is to
demonstrate SASE FEL emission in the VUV and, in
a second phase, to build a soft X-ray user facility [15,16].

FIG. 1.

Schematic layout of phase 1 of the SASE FEL
at the TESLA Test Facility at DESY, Hamburg. The linac
contains two 12.2 m long cryogenic modules each equipped
with eight 9-cell superconducting accelerating cavities [20].
The total length is 100 m.

The layout is shown in Fig. 1. The main parameters for
FEL operation are compiled in Table I. The injector is
based on a laser-driven 1 1
2 -cell rf gun electron source op-
erating at 1.3 GHz [17]. It uses a Cs2Te cathode [18] and
can generate bunch charges more than 10 nC at 1 MHz
repetition rate. A loading system allows mounting and
changing of cathodes while maintaining ultra-high vac-
uum conditions [18]. The cathode is illuminated by a
train of UV laser pulses generated in a mode-locked solid-
state laser system [19] synchronized with the rf. An en-
ergy of up to 50 µJ with a pulse-to-pulse variation of 2%
(rms) is achieved. The UV pulse length measured with
a streak camera is σt = 7.1 ± 0.6 ps . The rf gun is
operated with a peak electric ﬁeld of 37 MV/m on the
photocathode. The rf pulse length was limited to 100 µs
and the repetition rate to 1 Hz for machine protection
reasons. The gun section is followed by a 9-cell super-
conducting cavity, boosting the energy to 16 MeV. The
superconducting accelerator structure has been described
elsewhere [20].

The undulator is a ﬁxed 12 mm gap permanent magnet
device using a combined function magnet design [21] with
a period length of λu = 27.3 mm and a peak ﬁeld of Bu =
0.46 T, resulting in an undulator parameter of K = 1.17.
Integrated quadrupole structures produce a gradient of
12 T/m superimposed on the periodic undulator ﬁeld in
order to focus the electron beam along the undulator.
The undulator system is subdivided into three segments,
each 4.5 m long and containing 10 quadrupole sections
to build up 5 full focusing-defocusing (FODO) cells. The
FODO lattice periodicity runs smoothly from segment to
segment. There is a spacing of 0.3 m between adjacent
segments for diagnostics. The total length of the system
is 14.1 m. The vacuum chamber incorporates 10 beam
position monitors and 10 orbit correction magnets per
segment, one for each quadrupole [22,23].

For optimum overlap between the electron light beams,
high precision on the magnetic ﬁelds and mechanical
alignment are required. The undulator ﬁeld was adjusted
such that the expected rms deviations of the electron or-
bit should be smaller than 10 µm at 300 MeV [24]. The
beam orbit straightness in the undulator is determined by
the alignment precision of the superimposed permanent-
magnet quadrupole ﬁelds which is better than 50 µm in
both vertical and horizontal direction. The relative align-

ment of the three segments is accomplished with a laser
interferometer to better than 30 µm [25].

Diﬀerent techniques have been used to measure the
emittance of the electron beam [26]: Magnet optics scan-
ning (“quadrupole scans”), tomographic reconstruction
of the phase space including space charge eﬀects, and
the slit system method. All methods use optical transi-
tion radiation emitted from aluminum foils to measure
the bunch proﬁles and yield values for the normalized
emittance of (4 ± 1) π mrad mm for a bunch charge of
1 nC at the exit of the injector. The emittance in the un-
dulator, as determined from quadrupole scans and from
a system of wire scanners was typically between 6 and
10 π mrad mm (in both horizontal and vertical phase
space). It should be noted that the measurement tech-
niques applied determine the emittance integrated over
the entire bunch length. However, for FEL physics, the
emittance of bunch slices much shorter than the bunch
length is the relevant parameter.
It is likely that, due
to spurious dispersion and wakeﬁelds, the bunch axis is
tilted about a transverse axis such that the projected
emittance is larger than the emittance of any slice. Based
on these considerations we estimate the normalized slice
emittance in the undulator at (6 ± 3) π mrad mm.

A bunch compressor is inserted between the two accel-
erating modules, in order to increase the peak current of
the bunch up to 500 A, corresponding to 0.25 mm bunch
length (rms) for a 1 nC bunch with Gaussian density pro-
ﬁle. Experimentally, it is routinely veriﬁed that a large
fraction of the bunch charge is compressed to a length
below 0.4 mm (rms) [27]. There are indications that the
core is compressed even further. We estimate the peak
current for the FEL experiment at (400 ± 200) A. Coher-
ent synchrotron radiation in the magnetic bunch com-
pressor may aﬀect the emittance and the energy spread
at such short bunch lengths [28].

III. FEL MEASUREMENTS

A strong evidence for the FEL process is a large in-
crease in the on-axis radiation intensity if the electron
beam is injected such that it overlaps with the radia-
tion during the entire passage through the undulator.
Fig. 2 shows the intensity passing a 0.5 mm iris, lo-
cated on axis 12 m downstream of the undulator, as a
function of the horizontal beam position at the undula-
tor entrance. The observed intensity inside a window of
±200 µm around the optimum beam position is a factor
of more than 100 higher than the intensity of spontaneous
radiation. A PtSi photodiode was used integrating over
all wavelengths. Note that the vacuum chamber diam-
eter in the undulator (9.5 mm) is much larger than the
beam diameter (300 µm).

SASE gain is expected to depend on the bunch charge
in an extremely nonlinear way. Fig. 3 shows the mea-
sured intensity on axis as a function of bunch charge Q,

2

while the beam orbit is kept constant for optimum gain.
The solid line indicates the intensity of the spontaneous
undulator radiation multiplied by a factor of 100. The
strongly nonlinear increase of the intensity as a function
of bunch charge is a deﬁnite proof of FEL action. The
gain does not further increase if the bunch charge exceeds
some 0.6 nC. This needs further study, but it is known
that the beam emittance becomes larger for increasing Q
thus reducing the FEL gain.

FIG. 2. Sensitivity of radiation power to horizontal elec-
tron beam position at the undulator entrance. The dots rep-
resent mean values of the radiation intensity for each beam
position. The horizontal error bars denote the rms beam posi-
tion instability while the vertical error bars indicate the stan-
dard deviation of intensity ﬂuctuations, which are due to the
statistical charcter of the SASE process, see. Eq. (3)

todiode behind a 0.5 mm aperture in a distance of 12 m from
the end of the undulator. The dotted line is the result of
numerical simulation.

The wavelength spectrum of the radiation (taken on
axis at maximum FEL gain) is presented in Fig. 4. The
central wavelength of 108.5 nm is consistent with the
measured beam energy of (233 ± 5) MeV and the known
undulator parameter K = 1.17, see Eq. (1). The inten-
sity gain determined with the CCD camera of the spec-
trometer is in agreement with the photodiode result.

A characteristic feature of SASE FELs is the concen-
tration of radiation power into a cone much narrower
than that of wavelength integrated undulator radiation,

3

l
l
whose opening angle is in the order of 1/γ. Measure-
ments done by moving the 0.5 mm iris horizontally to-
gether with the photodiode conﬁrm this expectation, see
Fig. 5. The spontaneous intensity is ampliﬁed by a factor
of 30 to be visible on this scale.

In order to study which section of the undulator con-
tributes most to the FEL gain, we applied closed orbit
beam bumps to diﬀerent sections of the undulator, thus
disturbing the gain process at various locations along the
undulator. It was seen that practically the entire undu-
lator contributes, but with some variation in local gain.
Some improvement in the over-all gain should be possible
by optimizing the settings of the 30 orbit correction coils
which have not been touched so far.

To determine the absolute FEL intensity, the photo-
diode is ﬁrstly calibrated using the known intensity of
undulator radiation. For the iris diameter of 3 mm used
for spontaneous emission and averaging the solid angle
Ω over the source positions inside the undulator, we get
Ω = 2 × 10−8. About 70 pJ is accepted within the iris
at the ﬁrst harmonic of the spontaneous undulator radi-
ation per 1 nC bunch charge. The SASE FEL signal was
measured using an iris diameter of 0.5 mm, the signal was
larger by a factor of about 5. Hence, the energy ﬂux is
2 nJ/mm2 at the location of the detector and the on-axis
ﬂux per unit solid angle is about 0.3 J/sr (assuming a
source position at the end of the undulator). This value
was used as input for the numerical simulation of the
SASE FEL performed with the code FAST [29]. The lon-
gitudinal proﬁle of the bunch current was assumed to be
Gaussian with an rms length of 0.25 mm. The transverse
distribution of the beam current density was also taken
to be Gaussian. Calculations have been performed for a
Gaussian energy spread of 0.1%. According to numerical
simulation one of the most critical parameters for FEL
operation is the normalized emittance εn that was varied
in the simulations between 5 and 10 π mrad mm. A ﬁrst
conclusion from our calculations is that the TTF FEL
operates in the high-gain linear regime where the power
grows exponentially along the undulator. The contribu-
tion of the fundamental transverse mode TEM00 to the
total power seems to dominate, so that Eq. (2) applies.
Our calculations show that the length at which a level
of energy ﬂux of 0.3 J/sr is obtained strongly depends on
emittance, but the number of gain lengths is roughly the
same in all cases and is about 5. Figs. 4 and 5 include
typical theoretical spectral and angular distributions as
calculated by our numerical simulation. In both cases ex-
perimental curves are wider than the simulation results.
A possible source of the widening is energy and orbit jit-
ter, since the experimental curves are results of averaging
over many bunches.

The FEL gain is deﬁned as the ratio of output to input
powerPout/Pin, see Eq. (2). It is a characteristic of the
FEL ampliﬁer and should depend only on the parameters
of the electron beam and the undulator but not on the
type of input signal. For a FEL ampliﬁer seeded by an
external laser the input power is well deﬁned. For an

FEL ampliﬁer starting from noise (i.e. a SASE FEL)
the eﬀective power of shot noise can be deﬁned as the
power of optimally focused seeding radiation yielding the
same output power. The gain G is then simply G =
A exp(2z/Lg), see Eq. (2). With an input coupling factor
A ≈ 0.1, the FEL gain can be estimated at G ≈ 3 · 103.
The uncertainty is estimated at a factor of 3 (i.e. 103 <
G < 104) and is mainly due to the imprecise knowledge
of the longitudinal beam proﬁle.

It is essential to realize that the ﬂuctuations seen in
Figs. 2 and 3 are not primarily due to unstable operation
of the accelerator but are inherent to the SASE process.
Shot noise in the electron beam causes ﬂuctuations of
the beam density, which are random in time and space
[30]. As a result, the radiation produced by such a beam
has random amplitudes and phases in time and space
and can be described in terms of statistical optics.
In
the linear regime of a SASE FEL, the radiation pulse
energy measured in a narrow central cone (opening angle
±20 µrad in our case) at maximum gain is expected to
ﬂuctuate according to a gamma distribution p(E) [31],

where hEi is the mean energy, Γ(M ) is the gamma func-
tion with argument M , and M −1 = h(E − hEi)2i/hEi2
is the normalized variance of E. The parameter M cor-
responds to the number of longitudinal optical modes.
Note that the same kind of statistics applies for com-
pletely chaotic polarized light, in particular for sponta-
neous undulator radiation.

The rms ﬂuctuation yields a number of longitudinal modes

M = 14.4. The bunch charge is 1 nC.

For these statistical measurements the signals from
3000 radiation pulses have been recorded, with the small
iris (0.5 mm diameter) in front of the photo diode to
guarantee that transversely coherent radiation pulses are
selected. As one can see from Fig. 6, the distribution of
the energy in the radiation pulses is quite close to the

gamma distribution. The relative rms ﬂuctuations are
about 26% corresponding to M = 14.4. One should take
into account that these ﬂuctuations arise not only from
the shot noise in the electron beam, but the pulse-to-
pulse variations of the beam parameters can also con-
tribute to the ﬂuctuations. Thus, the value M ≈ 14 can
be considered as a lower limit for the number of longitu-
dinal modes in the radiation pulse. Using the width of
radiation spectrum we calculate the coherence time [31]
and ﬁnd that the part of the electron bunch contribut-
ing to the SASE process is at least 100 µm long. ¿From
the quality of the agreement with the gamma distribu-
tion we can also conclude that the statistical properties of
the radiation are described with Gaussian statistics. In
particular, this means that there are no FEL saturation
eﬀects.

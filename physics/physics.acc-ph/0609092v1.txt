Abstract

We propose a model-independent quantity, L/G, to characterize non-Gaussian tails
in beam proﬁles observed with the Fermilab Booster Ion Proﬁle Monitor. This quan-
tity can be considered a measure of beam halo in the Booster. We use beam dynamics
and detector simulations to demonstrate that L/G is superior to kurtosis as an ex-
perimental measurement of beam halo when realistic beam shapes, detector eﬀects
and uncertainties are taken into account. We include the rationale and method of
calculation for L/G in addition to results of the experimental studies in the Booster
where we show that L/G is a useful halo discriminator.

1 Introduction

The generation and characterization of beam halo has been of increasing im-
portance as beam intensities increase, particularly in a machine such as the
Fermilab Booster. The FNAL Booster provides a proton beam that ultimately
is used for collider experiments, antiproton production, and neutrino exper-
iments – all high intensity applications. The injection energy of the Booster
is 400 MeV, low enough that space charge dynamics can contribute to beam
halo production. Beam loss, in large part due to halo particles, has resulted in
high radiation loads in the Booster ring. The beam loss must be continuously
monitored, with safeguards to insure that average loss rates do not exceed safe

levels for ground water, the tunnel exterior, and residual radiation within the
tunnel. Collimation systems have been installed to localize beam loss within
shielded regions [1].

Methods have been developed to characterize beam halo that are based on
analyzing the kurtosis of the beam proﬁle [2,3,4]. Kurtosis is a measure of
whether a data set is peaked or ﬂat relative to a normal (Gaussian) distribu-
tion. Distributions with high kurtosis have sharp peaks near the mean that
come down rapidly to heavy tails. The kurtosis will decrease or go negative as
a distribution becomes more square, such as in cases where shoulders develop
on the beam proﬁle. An important feature of quantiﬁers such as the proﬁle and
halo parameters (introduced by Crandall, Allen, and Wangler in Refs. [2] and
[3]) is that they are model independent. Such beam shape quantities based
on moments of the beam particle distribution are discussed in Ref. [7], which
extends previous work based on 1D spatial projections [2] to a 2D particle
beam phase space formalism. These studies utilize numerical simulations of
the physics which cause the halo generation, but ignore the potential eﬀects
of the detectors used in the experimental measurements. In realistic accel-
erator operating conditions and, to some extent, also in carefully prepared
dedicated beam halo measuring experiments, instrumental eﬀects can reduce
the eﬀectiveness of the above deﬁned quantities. Even when state-of-the-art
3D numerical simulations are used to model realistic experiments, the models
fail to describe the measured beam distributions to the desired detail [8]. In
the following, we will investigate the use of shape parameters relevant to the
proﬁles observed with the Fermilab Booster IPM, and will study how they
perform using realistice 3D particle beam simulations and a model of the IPM
detector response.

Beam proﬁle measurements in the Fermilab Booster are almost exclusively
done with an Ion Proﬁle Monitor (IPM) [5]. The Booster IPM is able to
extract horizontal and vertical beam proﬁles on a turn-by-turn basis for an
entire Booster cycle. The IPM relies on the ionization of background gas by
the particle beam in the vicinity of the detector. A high voltage ﬁeld is applied
locally, causing the ionized particles to migrate to micro-strip counters on a
multi-channel plate. The applied high voltage is perpendicular to the mea-
surement axis of the multi-channel plate, so that it does not alter the relative
transverse positions of the ions. However, the space charge ﬁelds of the particle
beam aﬀect the transverse trajectories of the ions, requiring a sophisticated
calibration of the IPM to relate the measured width of the distribution to the
true width of the particle beam [6].

This paper describes a new quantity for characterizing beam proﬁles, L/G.
We start by describing the observed beam proﬁles in the Booster and their
parametrization. We then deﬁne and calculate kurtosis and L/G for the re-
sulting functional form. Next, we consider the eﬀect of the systematic and

2

statistical uncertainties in the IPM detector on both kurtosis and L/G. We
then combine a simulation of beam dynamics with a simulation of the IPM
detector response in order to demonstrate that L/G can be used to character-
ize the non-Gaussian beam tails in the Booster. We compare the sensitivity
of L/G to that of kurtosis, and we ﬁnd that L/G is a superior discriminator
of beam halo when realistic beam shapes, detector eﬀects and uncertainties
are taken into account. Finally, we present the results of two Booster beam
studies performed with and without beam collimators, which demonstrate the
sensitivity of L/G to non-Gaussian beam tails.

2 Booster beam proﬁles

The Booster IPM is used to measure beam proﬁles under a wide range of
operating conditions, ranging from normal operating conditions to machine
tuning and beam studies under potentially extreme conditions. The beams
under these conditions vary considerably. Following the standard experimental
procedure for characterizing a peak signal combined with a potentially large
background by ﬁtting to a Gaussian plus polynomial background, the IPM
data are characterized by ﬁtting the proﬁles to a sum of Gaussian and linear
functions [5],

f (x) = Ng(x) + Ml(x),

and N, M ,σ, x0, and c1 are the ﬁtting parameters. This parametrization does
a reasonable job of characterizing the observed IPM proﬁles. Fig. 1 shows a
typical beam proﬁle observed during normal Booster operations, along with
the ﬁt to Eq. 1.

3 Characterizing observed proﬁles

Our goal is to describe the shape of the observed beam proﬁles by some pa-
rameter derived from the observed beam shape. For simplicity, we start by

which is shown in Fig. 2.

Our goal is to use an experimentally accessible observable to quantify the non-
Gaussian portion of the observed beam, which amounts to using the inverse
of Eq. 10. From Fig. 2 it is clear that kurtosis is not a good observable for this
problem. In order to extract beam shape information µ from an observable k,
we need the inverse function µ(k). For this beam shape, µ(k) is multi-valued
for a signiﬁcant portion of the possible range of µ. A beam that is roughly
half non-Gaussian (µ
0.5) has the same kurtosis as a beam with no non-
Gaussian component whatsoever (µ = 0). At best, kurtosis gives a qualitative
measure of the degree to which the distribution is non-Gaussian.

4 Detector eﬀects

Extracting beam shape information from the Booster IPM is complicated by
the beam intensity-dependent smearing of the signal and statistical noise. The
smearing eﬀect comes from the electromagnetic ﬁeld generated by the beam
itself. The observed beam shape is a convolution of the true shape with the re-
sponse function of the detector, the smearing function. The authors of Ref. [6]
studied the IPM smearing function and developed a system for extracting the
true beam width from the observed IPM data. In the case discussed in the
reference, the objective was to study the evolution of the statistical emittance
of the beam, which only depends on the second moment of the beam proﬁle.
By assuming a Gaussian shape for the true beam distribution, it was possible
to invert the smearing function as it applies to the beam size. Experimental
measurements utilizing independent measurements of the beam size veriﬁed
that the inversion of the smearing function is accurate when applied to beam
size.

Since halo studies require quantitative measurement of the shape of the beam
in addition to the size, any inversion of the smearing function would be strongly
dependent on the assumed shape. Furthermore, independent measurements of
the true beam shape are not readily available, so experimental veriﬁcation

versus channel number. The standard deviation for each pedestal was averaged for
35 consecutive runs (Booster cycles); the error bars shown represent the RMS of
these 35 runs. Note that channel 31 is used to measure the Booster charge as a
function of turn, thus it is natural that the characteristic spread of each pedestal is
diﬀerent than the rest of the channels.

is excluded. The method we present in these paper avoids the diﬃculties of
inverting the IPM smearing function by operating directly on the raw IPM
data. Where we compare the experimental data with predictions from beam
dynamics simulations, we smear the simulation results in order to compare
them with data.

The smearing function is not the only experimental complication. Each chan-
nel in the IPM includes a constant pedestal that must be subtracted from the
data. Before each IPM run, 30 pedestal triggers are collected; these triggers
are used to ﬁnd the mean and standard deviation of the pedestal. Fig. 5 shows
the typical pedestal variation present in the IPM. The pedestal introduces a
ﬂuctuation in the data that is constant across the entire detector. We take this
source of error into account when calculating the ﬁts to Eq. 1, so the expected
eﬀect on L/G is only a small increase in the overall error. The kurtosis calcu-

lation suﬀers a much larger error because of the eﬀect of the (x
the error in x far from x0 is magniﬁed fourfold. We will see below that the
end result is a smaller overall fractional error in L/G than in kurtosis when
extracting from data.

5 Results using simulated data

In order to test our L/G technique and compare it with kurtosis, we employ
an integrated simulation of both the Booster accelerator and the IPM detec-
tor. Our accelerator model is based on the code Synergia [4], which includes
halo generating eﬀects such as nonlinearities in the accelerator lattice and 3D
space-charge eﬀects. Our IPM detector model includes both the space-charge
eﬀects on the IPM response [6] and pedestal variations. We simulate a variety
of initial beam shapes, ranging from a Gaussian with no space-charge eﬀects, to
beam with severe halo component, much larger than what is usually observed
experimentally at the Booster. In order to generate beams with large halo that
are realistic, we construct an initial beam containing a matched Gaussian com-
ponent combined with a completely ﬂat (and mismatched) halo component,
then use Synergia to simulate its evolution through two revolutions through
the Booster. The resulting beam has a proﬁle that is qualitatively consistent
with observed beam proﬁles.

In Fig. 6 we show simulated beam proﬁles using a purely Gaussian beam, with
and without detector smearing eﬀects. Figs. 7 and 8 show proﬁles for a beam
that has been adjusted to have a non-Gaussian component consistent with
typical proﬁles observed in the Booster (Fig. 7) and the sort of beam observed
under extremely mismatched conditions (Fig. 8). The ﬁtted curves in these
ﬁgures are ﬁts to f (x) (Eq. 1.) In Fig. 9 we show the measured proﬁle for ten
consecutive turns (added together to increase statistics), obtained during beam
study time with the Booster operating with a severely mismatched beam,
and the simulated (beam and detector response) proﬁles for similar beam
conditions: the agreement is very good 2

integration limits in units of σ

Fig. 10. Values of the L/G components and L/G as a function of the integration
limits in units of the sigma of the Gaussian component.

we take seven diﬀerent input beams with mixing parameters µ ranging from 0
to 0.7. We then pass them through two simulated revolutions of the Booster
cycle and then the detector simulation. Although the input beams have an
unrealistically large non-Gaussian component, by the time the beam enters
the detector simulation, after a few turns through the accelerator simulation,
the halo fraction has reached realistic levels.

As described above, L/G depends on the parameter n, the number of units of σ
over which to perform our integrations. We have (somewhat arbitrarily) chosen
n = 5 for our results. In Fig.10, we show the variation of L, G and the ratio
L/G as a function of n for a simulated beam proﬁle with a moderate non-
Gaussian contribution. The ﬁts we always use all the information available
to us, i.e., the full range of the detector, so the choice of n is an arbitrary
convention.

The results of our simulated studies are summarized in Figs. 11 and 12, where
we have calculated kurtosis and L/G from both unsmeared and smeared sim-
ulated proﬁles, as a function of µ. The two ﬁgures correspond to simulated
data with diﬀerent beam widths, corresponding to the widths shown in the
left and right plots of Figs. 6–8. The simulated results in the ﬁgures verify
our arguments for the superiority of L/G as compared with kurtosis for this
analysis: First, L/G increases monotonically with µ, while kurtosis does not.
Second, the fractional error bars are much smaller for L/G. Third, the eﬀect
of detector smearing on L/G is small compared to the overall error, while
it is relatively larger for kurtosis. Finally, and most importantly, L/G pro-
vides a statistically signiﬁcant signal for the presence of non-Gaussian beam
components, while kurtosis does not.

6 Beam studies using L/G

As an application of the L/G technique, we have studied the eﬀects of the beam
collimators on the beam shape. The results of two studies are presented. Both
studies compare L/G analysis of IPM proﬁle data for the case where a beam
collimator is near the beam, to the case where the collimator is away from the
beam. One study uses a collimator located within the Booster ring, while the
other uses a collimator in the linear accelerator (linac). The Linac [10] is the
injector for the Booster synchrotron.

The Fermilab Booster is an alternating gradient synchrotron of radius 75.47
meters. It accelerates protons from 400 MeV to 8 GeV over the course of
20,000 turns. The optical lattice consists of 24 cells (or periods) with four
combined function magnets each, with horizontal and vertical tunes of 6.7

injected for ten Booster turns, for a total average current of 420 mA. The

be found in Ref. [9].

6.1 Data selection

For the L/G procedure to work successfully it is very important that noisy
and dead channels are excluded from the ﬁts. Before analyzing any set of
IPM proﬁles taken over a particular Booster cycle (an IPM run), the pedestal
information on each IPM channel is used to identify channels that need to
be excluded. The standard deviation of the pedestal data for all runs in a
given study period is averaged. Channels with very large standard deviation
(noisy), or zero standard deviation (dead), are excluded from the ﬁts. Fig. 5
shows the average pedestal sigma (standard deviation) for each IPM channel
for one characteristic IPM data set (35 runs). The ﬁgure shows all the channels
recorded by the IPM data acquisition system. The vertical and horizontal
IPM data are encoded in 30 channels each. Channel 31 contains the Booster
charge information, which is why it has a wider pedestal RMS than the rest
of the channels. In this picture, there are no noisy (anomalously large sigma)
channels. However, there are ﬁve dead channels, which are easily identiﬁed by
their small pedestal variation.

6.2 L/G with Booster collimators

The horizontal and vertical collimators within the Booster ring are each a two-
stage system; a thin copper foil located at a short straight section in period
5, followed by secondary collimators in the long straight sections of periods 6
and 7. The beam edge can be put near the copper foil in order to scatter halo
particles. The secondary collimators pick up the scattered particles [1].

The beam edge is near the collimator only after beam injection is complete;
so, for this study IPM proﬁles were taken at the end of the Booster cycle.
Measurements were made both with the collimator in and with the collimator
out, and repeated for several cycles. The average value of L/G for 500 turns
at the end of the booster cycle was extracted from each set of proﬁle data (in
other words, from each run). Fig. 13 shows a histogram of the number of runs
versus their average L/G value. Even though there is a great deal of spread
in the data, the mean values of L/G for collimators in and collimators out
are distinctly separated. The overall distributions clearly show that L/G is

tive in reducing activation due to uncontrolled beam loss. The activation limit for
1017 pro-
Booster throughput after the installation of the collimators is near 1
tons/hr, approximately double the number allowed before the installation of the
collimators.

lower when the collimators are in the Booster. Since the Booster collimators
are eﬀective in reducing beam halo (see Fig. 14), we conclude that L/G is a
good quantity to use to identify beam halo from beam proﬁle measurements.

6.3 L/G with Linac collimator

The Fermilab Linac accelerates beam from an energy of 750 KeV to an energy
of 400 MeV. The Linac collimator is located after the ﬁrst accelerating tank,
where the beam energy is 10 MeV. The collimator has several diﬀerent size
apertures that may be inserted into the beam path. In order to collimate the
beam for these studies, the 1/2-inch diameter hole was used.

The procedure was much the same as for the study with the Booster col-
limator, except here the IPM proﬁles at Booster injection, rather than near
extraction, were used. Since the beam halo was reduced in the Linac, the eﬀect
on the Booster beam proﬁle should have been most pronounced at injection,
before evolution of the beam distribution through the acceleration cycle. IPM
proﬁles for the ﬁrst 500 turns after beam injection into the Booster were used
to extract an average L/G value for each run. Runs were done both with
the Linac collimator inserted and with the Linac collimator removed. Fig. 15
shows a histogram of the number of runs versus their average L/G value. The
L/G distributions for collimator-in and collimator-out conditions are clearly
diﬀerentiated. Presumably the distinction is cleaner for the Linac collimator
study because the beam distribution has not undergone as much evolution be-
tween the scraping and the proﬁle measurement as in the case of the Booster
collimator study.

7 Conclusion

A new method of characterizing beam halo, the L/G technique, has been devel-
oped for beam proﬁle measurements using the Fermilab Booster IPM. Proﬁle
data is ﬁt with a combination of linear and Gaussian functions. The ratio of
the integrated values of those functions is taken, with higher L/G values cor-
responding to larger tails in the beam distribution. Simulations implementing
both models of the accelerator and the response of the IPM show that L/G
is superior to kurtosis for characterizing the presence of non-Gaussian por-
tions of the beam both because L/G is a monotonically increasing function of
the non-Gaussian fraction of the beam whereas kurtosis is not, and because
L/G is less aﬀected by detector errors and smearing than kurtosis. The L/G
quantiﬁer has been tested experimentally in the Booster ring via collimator
studies. Two beam studies were done, both using the Booster IPM to obtain
the needed proﬁle data. One study compared injection proﬁle data for the case
of having the Linac beam collimated versus having no collimation. The second
study compared proﬁle data near extraction for the case of having the Booster
collimator act on the beam versus no collimation. Both studies demonstrated
that the L/G parameter is a good indicator for beam halo. We expect that
this method will continue to be a useful tool.

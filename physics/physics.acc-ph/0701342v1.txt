Abstract. We discuss the features of a crystalline undulator of the novel type based
on the eﬀect of a planar channeling of ultra-relativistic electrons in a periodically bent
crystals. It is demonstrated that an electron-based undulator is feasible in the tens of
GeV range of the beam energies, which is noticeably higher than the energy interval
allowed in a positron-based undulator. Numerical analysis of the main parameters of
the undulator as well as the characteristics of the emitted undulator radiation is carried
out for 20 and 50 GeV electrons channeling in diamond and silicon crystals along the
(111) crystallographic planes.

1. Introduction

In this paper we suggest and discuss a new type of a powerful source of high
energy photons generated by a bunch of ultra-relativistic electrons undergoing planar
channeling in a periodically bent crystal. We call such system ’an electron-based
crystalline’ undulator. The feasibility of the undulator has been recently proven for the
ﬁrst time in [1]. In this work the results of more detailed qualitative and quantitative
analysis of the radiation formed in electron-based crystalline undulators at diﬀerent
energies of electron and for diﬀerent types of crystals are presented.

As it is known [2,3], in a crystalline undulator there appears, in addition to the well-
known channeling radiation [4], the radiation of an undulator type which is due to the
periodic motion of channeling particles which follow the bending of the crystallographic
planes. In the cited papers, as well as in the subsequent publications [5–8], a feasibility
to create a short-wave crystalline undulator emitting intensive and monochromatic
radiation, based on an ultra-relativistic positron channeling was proven (for the latest
review see [8]). More recently [9] it was shown that the brilliance of the radiation from
a positron-based crystalline undulator in the energy range from hundreds of keV up to
tens of MeV is comparable to that of a conventional light source of the third generation
but for much lower photon energies. Experimental study of this phenomenon is on the
way within the framework of the PECU project [10].

to neighbouring crystallographic planes (separated by the distance d) which are
periodically bent. The wavy lines show the trajectories of channeling particles. A
positron channels between two neighbouring planes, whereas the electron channeling
occurs nearby the crystallographic plane. The proﬁle of periodic bending is given by
y(z) = a sin(2πz/λ), where λ and a are the period and amplitude of the bending
(indicated in graph (a)).

The operational principle of a crystalline undulator does not depend on the type
of a projectile and is illustrated by ﬁgure 1. Under certain conditions [2, 3] an ultra-
relativistic charged particle, which enters the crystal at the angle smaller than the
Lindhard’s critical angle [11], will penetrate through the crystal following the bendings
of its planes. Consequently, the trajectory of the particle contains two elements.
Firstly, there are oscillations due to the action of the interplanar force, - the channeling

oscillations [11], whose frequency Ωch = c
max/dε (c is the speed of light) depends
on the energy of the particle ε and the parameters of the channel: the maximal gradient
p
of the interplanar potential U ′
max and the interplanar distance d. Secondly, there are
oscillations due to the periodicity of the bendings, the undulator oscillations, whose
frequency is ω0
2πc/λ, where λ is the spatial period of bending. The spontaneous
emission is associated with both of these oscillations. Typical frequencies of the
4γ2ω0/(2 + p2), where
channeling and undulator radiation are ωch
γ = ε/mc2 is the Lorentz factor of the particle and p = 2πγa/λ is the undulator
parameter, a is the amplitude of bending. If ω0
Ωch, then the frequencies of channeling
and undulator radiation are well separated. In this case the characteristics of undulator
radiation are practically independent on channeling oscillations [2,3], and the operational
principle of a crystalline undulator is the same as for a conventional one [12–14], in which
the monochromaticity of the radiation is the result of a constructive interference of the
photons emitted from similar parts of trajectory.

Earlier, it was demonstrated that these conditions can be achieved in a positron-based
undulator [2, 3, 8]. In the present work, we demonstrate this for an electron-based one.
Prior to doing this let us present a short description of the physics lying behind these
conditions.

A stable channeling of a projectile in a periodically bent channel occurs if the
maximal centrifugal force in the channel Fcf is less than the maximal interplanar force
U ′
ε/Rmin, where
Rmin = λ2/4π2a is the minimum curvature radius of the channel with the proﬁle of the

The operation of a crystalline undulator must be considered in the large-amplitude
regime. Omitting the discussion (see [2, 3, 8]) we note, that the limit a/d > 1
accompanied by the condition C
1 is mostly advantageous, since in this case the
typical frequencies of undulator and channeling radiation are well separated, and the
latter does not aﬀect the parameters of the former, whereas the intensity of the undulator
radiation becomes comparable or higher than that of the channeling radiation. On the
other hand, the inequality a
λ means that the crystal structure is not destroyed and
the deformation is an elastic one. Also, this results in moderate values of the undulator
parameter, p
1, which ensure that the emitted radiation is of the undulator type rather
than of the synchrotron one. Consequently, the quantities a, d and λ must satisfy the

double inequality presented in the second line in (1).

≫

The term ’undulator’ signiﬁes that the number of periods is large, N

1. This
inequality leads to a very peculiar pattern of a spectral-angular distribution of the
emitted radiation. Namely, for each value of the emission angle θ (measured with
respect to the undulator axis) the spectrum consists of a set of narrow, well-separated
peaks (harmonics). In a conventional undulator, based on the action of a magnetic (or
electric) ﬁeld [12–14], the beams of charged particles and photons move in vacuum. In
such ’ideal’ conditions the peak intensity of the emitted radiation is proportional to N 2.
In a crystalline undulator the beams move in a medium and are aﬀected by the
dechanneling and photon attenuation eﬀects, which noticeably reduce the N 2 increase
of the peak intensity [7]. Due to collisions with the crystal constituents the channeling
particle increases its transverse energy ε⊥. At some point ε⊥ exceeds the interplanar
potential barrier and leaves the channel. The average interval for a particle to penetrate
into a crystal until it dechannels is called the dechanneling length Ld.
In a straight
crystal Ld depends on its type, the energy and the type of a projectile.
In addition
to these, in a periodically bent crystal Ld acquires the dependence on the parameter
C [3]. The dechanneling length introduces a natural upper limit on the length of a
crystalline undulator: L
Ld(C). The essential diﬀerence between an electron-based
undulator and a positron-based one lies in the fact that the dechanneling process for
these projectiles occurs diﬀerently, resulting in a strong inequality Le−
[15]. We
discuss this important issue in more detail in section 2.

The photon attenuation stands for a decrease of the intensity of the emitted
radiation in the crystal due to the processes of absorption and scattering. The interval
within which the intensity decreases by a factor of e is called the attenuation length,
La(ω) [16]. This quantity is tabulated for a number of elements and over wide ranges
of photon frequencies [17]. It is worth noting that for suﬃciently high photon energies
102 keV) the restriction on the length of undulator due to the photon attenuation
(~ω
eﬀect becomes much less severe than to the dechanneling process [2, 3, 8].

≥

≫

It was demonstrated [7, 9] that in the limit L

Ld(C) the intensity of radiation
is deﬁned not by the total number of undulator periods N = L/λ, but rather by the
quantity Nd = Ld(C)/λ which is the number of periods within the dechanneling length.
Since for an ultra-relativistic particle Ld
ε [18–20], it seems natural that to increase
Nd one can consider higher energies. However, at higher energies another limitation
appears [2, 3, 6]. The coherence of undulator radiation is only possible when the energy
loss ∆ε of the particle during its passage through the undulator is small, ∆ε
ε. This
statement together with the fact, that for an ultra-relativistic projectile ∆ε is mainly
due to radiation [18], leads to the conclusion that L must be much smaller than the
radiation length Lr, which deﬁnes the mean energy loss of an ultra-relativistic particle
per unit length (see e.g. [18]). Therefore, we come to the forth and ﬁfth limitations in
(1).

A thorough analysis of the conditions (1) for the system ”periodically bent crystal
+ ultra-relativistic positrons” was performed for the ﬁrst time in [2, 3] (and analyzed

further in [5,6,8,9] ). The ranges of ε, a and λ for a number of crystals were established
within which the operation of the crystalline undulator is possible. These ranges include
Nd = 101 . . . 102,
ε = (0.5 . . . 5) GeV, a/d = 101 . . . 102, C = 0.01 . . . 0.2, N

by other authors [21, 22].

In the case of electron channeling the restriction due to the dechanneling eﬀect
on the parameters of undulator are much more severe [2, 3, 8]. Therefore it has been
commonly acknowledged that the concept of an electron-based undulator cannot be
realized.
In what follows we demonstrate that the crystalline undulator of this type
is feasible but operates in the regime of higher beam energies than the positron-based
undulator.

2. Dechanneling length of positrons and electrons in a periodically bent
crystal

As mentioned, random multiple scattering of a channeling particle by electrons and
nuclei of the crystal leads to the dechanneling eﬀect. As a result, the volume density n(z)
of the channeling particles decreases with the penetration distance z. The dependence
n(z) can be approximated as n(z) = n0 exp(
z/Ld) [3, 4, 19], where n0 is the density

natural limitation for the eﬀective length of a crystalline undulator [3, 7]. Therefore,
the crystalline undulator is feasible when Ld(C) is large enough to ensure that the
number of undulator periods within the dechanneling length satisﬁes the condition
Nd = Ld(C)/λ

−

1.

It is known that the dechanneling length of positrons exceeds that of electrons
(see, e.g., [15]). This is due to the diﬀerence in the channeling processes for these
projectiles. Indeed, positrons, possessing positive charge, are repulsed by crystal atoms
and, thus, channel between neighbouring crystallographic planes (see ﬁgure 1(a)), where
the concentration of nuclei and electrons is low. In contrast, electrons channel in close
vicinity of atomic planes (ﬁgure 1(b)) where the number of the collisions with the crystal
constituents is much larger. Therefore, electrons dechannel faster.

≫

Let us discuss the approximations which one can use to calculate the dechanneling

lengths of a positron and an electron.

The inﬂuence of the dechanneling process on the photon emission in a positron-
based crystalline undulator was considered in [2, 3, 7]. In the cited works the expression
for the dechanneling length of ultra-relativistic positrons in a periodically bent crystal,
based of the diﬀusion model [19], was written as follows:

Ld(C) = (1

where Ld(0) is the dechanneling length a straight channel. This quantity can be
estimated as Ld(0) = (256/9π2)(aTF dγ/r0 Λc) [3, 19], where r0 and aTF are the

well due to periodic bendings. The advantage of the approximate formula (2) is
that it explicitly demonstrates the dependence of the dechanneling length on C, ε
and parameters of the channel. Equation (2) was tested in [7] against more rigorous
calculations, based on the simulation procedure of the positron channeling in straight
and bent crystals. It was demonstrated that in wide range of the parameters (2) produces
a good quantitative estimate for Ld(C).

To estimate the dechanneling length for electrons, one can use the model due to
Baier and Katkov [18] which relates Ld(0) to a mean square of the multiple scattering
angle of an ultra-relativistic electron. Since electrons channel in close vicinity of atomic
planes, the multiple scattering occur predominantly from the nuclei of the crystal. The
latter makes the main contribution to the increase of ε⊥ [18]. Let q denote the mean
square of the multiple scattering angle per a unit length. Then, Ld(0) can be deﬁned as
the length within which the mean square of the multiple scattering angle becomes equal
to the square of Lindhard angle θL, i.e.
Ld(0) = θ2

length of an ultra-relativistic electron in a straight crystal [18]

This equation has been derived assuming that the dechanneling length of ultra-
relativistic electrons in a straight crystal is less than the characteristic length of the
radiation losses [18].

As far as we know (see also [24]), experimental measurements of the dechanneling
length during planar channeling of high energy electrons were performed in [25–27].
In [25, 26] the dechanneling length for 1.2 GeV electrons, channeled in Si(110) was
determined as Ld(0) = 25
5 µm. This value, as indicated in [25], is in a good agreement
with (5). However, in the experiment [27] the dechanneling length for 350 MeV electrons
channeled in Si(110) was found as Ld(0) = 31 µm, which is even greater than the value
based on (5). Therefore, we believe that the approximate formula (5) can be used for a
quantitative estimate of the dechanneling length of ultra-relativistic electrons in straight
crystals.

Figure 2 presents the dependence of Ld(0) on ε for planar channeling of electrons,
calculated in accordance with (5), and of positrons (see (2) for C = 0) in various straight
channels. Horizontal lines show the radiation length in the crystals. To calculate Lr
we used equation (27.22) from [16]. It is seen from ﬁgure 2 that for all energies the
dechanneling length for a positron exceeds that for an electron by more than an order
of magnitude: Le+

corresponding values of the undulator period are λ = Ld/Nd = 10−4 . . . 10−2 cm. From
ﬁgure 2 it is seen that this is exactly the interval to which Le−
d belongs. Therefore, for
an electron of the energy much smaller than 10 GeV the number of undulator periods
within the dechanneling length is equal, in the order of magnitude, to one. Hence, an
electron-based crystalline undulator can hardly be realized in this energy regime.

For higher energies, ε > 10 GeV, the dechanneling length of a positron becomes
comparable with the radiation length. This means, that a positron-based crystalline
undulator cannot be realized due to large radiation losses (see the last condition in
(1)). On the other hand, the dechanneling length of electrons at such energies, being
much lower than Lr, becomes comparable with Ld for positrons but of lower energies.
Therefore, an electron-based crystalline undulator is meaningful to discuss within the
interval ε

101 . . . 102 GeV.

To conclude this section let us discuss a model which allows one to deﬁne the

The factor (1

C)2 in (2) appears as a result of application of the harmonic
approximation for interplanar potential U(x) [6, 8, 19]. This approximation is adequate
for a positively charged projectile, but its validity is not obvious for an electron.
In
the latter case the interplanar potential is strongly anharmonic [15]. To calculate the
dependence of dechanneling length on C one can consider the following arguments. In
the point of maximum curvature, the eﬀective potential, acting on the electron, can
be written as UC(x) = U(x)
max x, where x is the distance from the plane. The
depth of the eﬀective potential well, ∆UC, deﬁnes the maximum value of the transverse
energy which an electron may gain. Within the framework of the diﬀusion theory [19]
the dechanneling length Ld(C) of an ultra-relativistic projectile in a bent channel is
proportional to ∆UC. Hence one can write Ld(C) = k(C) Ld(0), where Ld(0) is deﬁned
by equation (5) and k(C) stands for the ratio ∆UC/∆U < 1. To obtain the explicit
dependence k(C) one has to calculate the quantity ∆UC using a realistic model for U(x).

of an electron-based crystalline undulator.

3. Numerical results for the electron-based crystalline undulator

To prove the feasibility of an electron-based crystalline undulator for a ﬁxed value of
the undulator periods Nd = Ld(C)/λ it is necessary to establish the ranges of ε, a
and λ within which all the conditions, formulated in (1), are met. Once the ranges
are found one can calculate the spectral-angular distribution of the energy emitted in
the undulator. The results, presented below in this section, show, that for an electron-
102
based crystalline undulator the energy of emitted photons is in the range ~ω
keV. For such energies the values of the attenuation length for all crystals fall within
Ld(0). Therefore, it is the
the cm range [17], resulting in a strong inequality La(ω)
dechanneling which becomes the dominant eﬀect restricting the length of the undulator
(see the forth condition in (1)).

length: the solid curves stand for Nd = 5, the dashed curves - for Nd = 10, the chained

One can easily demonstrate that the ratio (a/d)max is reached when C = 0.2.
This is valid for all Nd (see ﬁgures 4 and 5, where open circles mark the parameters
corresponding to this value of C). The graphs (a) and (b) in ﬁgures 4 and 5 allow
one to explicitly establish the ranges of parameters within which the conditions (1)
are fulﬁlled, and consequently, the operation of an electron-based undulator is feasible.

These ranges are: C

Graphs (c,d) in ﬁgures 4 and 5 present the dependences on λ of the energy
fundamental harmonic (graph (c)) and of the peak intensity (9) calculated in the forward
direction at ω = ω1 and scaled by the factor γ2, graph (d). These graphs demonstrate
that within the a, λ and Nd ranges indicated above, the magnitude of ~ω and of the
intensity of undulator radiation can be varied by the orders of magnitude.

Figures 4(c) and 5(c) indicate that the energy of photons emitted in the 50 GeV
electron-based crystalline undulator lies within the 1 . . . 102 MeV range. Let us note
here, that the corresponding values of the attenuation lengths (for both C and Si
crystals) exceed 5 cm (see, e.g. [16, 17]). This value by far exceeds the dechanneling
lengths in the crystals. Therefore, the statement on the negligible role of the photon
attenuation, made in the opening paragraph of this section, is fully justiﬁed.

Let us now discuss the extent to which the decrease of the electron energy inﬂuences
the allowed ranges of parameters of the crystalline undulator. Figure 6 presents the

Figure 6. Same as in ﬁgure 4 but for a 20 GeV electron channeling in the periodically
bent C(111).

Comparing the curves in ﬁgures 6(a,b) with the corresponding dependences from
ﬁgures 5(a,b) one notices, that the domain of parameters a/d, λ and Nd consistent
with the conditions from (1) shrinks with the decrease of ε. Firstly, it is seen that the
undulator period for a 20 GeV electron is noticeable smaller than that for a 50 GeV
one. This feature is a corollary of a linear dependence of the dechanneling length on ε
(see (5)). As a result, the maximum value of the undulator period, λmax = Ld(0)/Nd,
1, is 2.5 times less for a 20 GeV electron. Due
consistent with the condition 0
to the same reason the maximal values of a/d in ﬁgure 6(a) are 2.5 times lower than
those in ﬁgure 5(a). Indeed from (5) and (10) follows, that for ﬁxed Nd and for the
ε. As a result, in the case of 20 GeV electrons the
same channel (a/d)max
condition a/d > 1 can be satisﬁed only within the reduced interval of the undulator
periods, Nd < 10.

The arguments, presented above, indicate that further decrease of ε will result,
eventually,
in a collapse of the domain of the parameters consistent with (1). To
illustrate this, in ﬁgure 7 we present the dependence of the ratio a/d on λ for a 1
GeV electron. This ﬁgure illustrates that the case Nd
1 can be realized only if
a/d < 1, which contradicts to the second condition from (1). For such low electron
energies the large-amplitude regime can be realized only for Nd

Figure 7. Dependence of a/d on λ for a 1 GeV electron channeling in a periodically
bent C(111). The curves correspond to diﬀerent values of undulator periods within
the dechanneling length: the solid curve stands for Nd = 5, the dashed curve - for
Nd = 10.

Figures 4-6 allow one to deﬁne a set of parameters which characterize the undulator
and its radiation. For example, ﬁxing Nd and C one ﬁnds: the period λ - from graphs
(b), the amplitude a - from graphs (a), ~ω1 and the peak intensity - from graphs (c)
and (d). In each ﬁgure, open circles mark the parameters of undulators with diﬀerent
number of Nd but with the same value of C equal to 0.2. For the undulators, based on
the electron channeling in C(111), we calculated the spectral distribution of radiation
(in the forward direction) in vicinity of the corresponding fundamental harmonics, i.e.
for ω
ω1. To calculate the distributions we followed the formalism, developed in [9],
which describes the undulator radiation in presence of the dechanneling and the photon
attenuation. Narrow peaks in ﬁgure 8 represent the results of these calculations. Wide
peak in each graph stands for the spectral distribution of the channeling radiation
in the forward direction. To obtain the latter we, at ﬁrst, calculated the spectra for
individual trajectories (using the P¨oschl-Teller model [18] for the interplanar potential),
corresponding to a stable channeling for given C. Then, the averaging procedure
was carried out to calculate the spectra (see [5, 6] for the details). Figure 8 clearly
demonstrates that by tuning the parameters of bending and varying the electron energy
it is possible to separate the frequencies of the undulator radiation from those of the
channeling radiation, and to make the intensity of the former comparable or higher than
of the latter.

4. Conclusion

We have demonstrated that it is feasible to devise an undulator based on the channeling
eﬀect of ultra-relativistic electrons in a periodically bent crystal. The electron-based

Figure 8. Spectral distributions of the undulator and channeling radiation emitted in
the forward direction by a 20 GeV (ﬁgure (a)) and by a 50 GeV (ﬁgure (b)) electron in
C(111). Narrow peaks stand for the spectral distribution of the undulator radiation in
the vicinity of the fundamental harmonics for six diﬀerent undulators (corresponding
to C = 0.2) deﬁned by open circles in ﬁgures 5 and 6. In each graph the ﬁrst (i.e., the
leftest) narrow peak corresponds to Nd = 5, the second peak - to Nd = 10, and the
third peak - to Nd = 15.

undulator operates in the tens of GeV range of electron energies. These energies are
noticeably higher than those in a positron-based undulator. Apart from the diﬀerence
in energies of the projectiles, other parameters of the crystalline undulators (i.e., a, p, λ)
are much alike. Therefore, to construct an electron-based undulator one can consider the
methods proposed earlier in connection with a positron-based undulator. These methods
include propagation of an acoustic wave [2, 3, 28] or the use of a graded composition of
diﬀerent layers [29] or a periodic mechanical deformation of the crystalline structure [21].
Present technologies allow one to construct the periodically bent crystalline
structures with the required parameters [10]. Similar to the case of a positron-based
undulator [9, 10], the parameters of high-energy electrons beams available at present
(see Ch. 26 in [16]) are suﬃcient to achieve the necessary conditions to construct the
undulator and to create, on its basis, powerful radiation sources in the γ-region of the
spectrum. As in the positron case [2, 3, 8] it is meaningful to explore the idea of a
γ-laser by means of an electron-based undulator.

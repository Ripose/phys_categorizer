1 Introduction

The electromagnetic waves, excited in plasma by charged bunches, can be used both for

focusing of bunches and for charge acceleration [1]. In the relativistic bunch case an ampli-

tude of excited one dimensional nonlinear plasma waves can essentially exceed the conven-
tional wavebreaking ﬁeld E∗ = mev0ωp/e (v0 is the phase velocity, ωp = (4πn0e2/me)1/2

is the electron plasma frequency, n0- plasma electron density in equilibrium) and reaches
of the value ˜E = [2(γ − 1)]1/2, where γ = (1 − β2)−1/2, β = v0/c, and ˜E is normalized on

E∗. Acceleration rate in the wake-ﬁelds can reaches of a few GeV/m, that is much more,

than was reached on conventional accelerators.

The one dimensional nonlinear wake-ﬁelds theory was developed in series of works

(see e.g. [2]-[8] and references therein). Maximum of the accelerated electrons energy, as
it was shown in [8], can reach of value 4mec2γ3.

In this paper bunches with the diﬀerent parameters investigated analytically and by

numerical simulation (including nonuniform and positively charged bunches).

2 One Dimensional Nonlinear Wake-ﬁelds

Consider a cold electron plasma with moving through the plasma, in Z direction charged

bunch (or train of bunches), which transverse sizes one can consider inﬁnite. The sub-

ject of our investigation is the steady wakeﬁelds excited by such bunches. Plasma ions

assumed immobile because of their large mass (me/mi ≪ 1). As usually we also as-

sume, that ﬁeld in front of the bunch (or bunches) is absent, potential and strength of

the electric ﬁeld are continuous in all space. Then, from the continuety equation, rela-

tivistic equation of motion for plasma electrons and the Poisson equation one can obtain

following equation for steady ﬁelds [5],[8]

βF
(F 2 − γ−2)1/2
where F = 1 + |e|ϕ/mec2 ≥ γ−1, ϕ is the electric potential, z = kp(Z − v0t), kp = ωp/v0

(here the phase velocity v0 is equal to bunch velocity), α(z) = (q/|e|)nb(z)/n0, e is the

2

electron charge, q is the charge of the bunch particles, nb(z) is their density. Normalized
on E∗ the strength of electric ﬁeld obeys the formula Ez(z) ≡ E = −(1/β2)dF/dz. The

plasma electrons dimensionless velocity as function of F is

βe = [β − (F 2 − γ−2)1/2]/(β2 + F 2).

Inside uniform bunches and outside of bunches Eq. (1) can be rewritten in the form

[5]

d2F
dz2 +

dU
dF

= 0,

U = β2[(γ2 + α)F − βγ2(F 2 − γ−2)1/2].

(2)

(3)

Formally Eq. (3) describes one-dimensional motion of a particle in a ﬁeld with potential

U(F ). Analysis of the function U(F ) allows to determine both qualitative behaviour of

the ﬁeld and some quantitative values (such as electric ﬁeld amplitude in the bunch, the

wave-breaking ﬁeld, maximum value of electric potential and other). Moreover, it can

be obtained analytical solution of Eq. (3), which includes the elliptic functions [3],[5]-[7].

However, even in the case of uniform bunch, the analytical description of the ﬁeld behind

bunch in general case is practically impossible. For nonuniform bunches the problem

analytically is not solved yet.

Outside the bunch (where α(z) = 0) ”potential” U(F ) has one minimum, therefore
the ﬁeld is periodical and for ﬁxed γ fully determines by electric ﬁeld amplitude Emp ≤ ˜E.

It is necessary to note that Eq. (3) with α = 0 describes also the wake wave, excited by

other way (for example, by laser pulse).

Nonlinear wake wavelength Λp increases as the amplitude Emp increases. When γ ≫ 1

the dependence Λp(Emp) practically not depend on γ and is presented on Figure 1 (notice,

that according to accepted in (1) variables, value Λp = 2π corresponds to the linear
approach). Near by the ”breaking” (Emp ≈ ˜E) the wake wavelength in the case of γ ≫ 1
is approximately equal to 4(2γ)1/2 [3], [6] and maximum value of the dimensionless electric
potential is Fmp ≈ (1+β2)γ [5]. In general case Fmp increases as Emp increases (see Fig.1).

The energy gain of electrons (or positrons) accelerating in the wake wave can reach
of value 4mec2γ3 [5]. Really, the relativistic equation of motion of accelerating electron

In the laboratory frame

In the case γ ≫ 1 and βa(0) ≥ β, choosing F (0) ≈ 1/γ and
F ≈ Fmp ≈ 2γ (that corresponds to Emp ≈ ˜E) obtain γa ≈ 4γ3. In this case acceleration
occur on the half of the wavelength;the acceleration length is proportional to γ5/2 [5]. For
example, when n0 = 3 · 1012cm−3 and γ = 10, the acceleration length is la ≈ 1m, Λp ≈
5cm and (γa)max ≈ 4000. The result (γa)max ∼ γ3 is consequence both of correlations
Emp ∼ γ1/2, Λp ∼ γ1/2 and relativistically large mass of the accelerating particle (i.e.

βa ≈ β ≈ 1), that causes long keeping back of the particle in accelerating phase. For

arbitrary wake wave amplitude the maximum value Fmp can be obtained from Fig.1.

For the large γ the acceleration length can surpasses the laboratory plasma sizes.

In the cosmos (for example, in the blanket of supernova), where the plasma can be

considered unlimited, acceleration in the strong plasma ﬁelds described here can originate

high energy cosmic rays.

3 Single Bunch

Consider a single uniform bunch:nb = const, when −d ≤ z ≤ 0 and nb = 0 elsewhere.

The ﬁeld inside the uniform bunch describes by Eq. (3). ”Potential” U(F ) is maximum

when F = 1/γ and is minimum when

F = Fc = |γ2 + α|/(γΓ1/2), Γ = γ2(1 + 2α) + α2.

From (5) follows, that in the case −1/(1+β) ≡ α1 < α < ∞ function U(F ) has minimum

and the ﬁeld inside bunch is periodical;F changes in the limits

(5)

(6)

1/γ ≤ F ≤ [(γ2 + α)2 + β2γ4]/γΓ.

4

When α = α1, U(F ) monotonously decreases as F increases and tends to zero when

F → ∞. In this case the electric ﬁeld strength inside the bunch grows from zero at the

bunch head (z = 0) and tends to some constant value (see (7)). When α < α1, U(F )

decreases unlimitedly, E grows from the bunch head to its tail (z = −d), and for bunch

length d more than some value dmax the wake behind the bunch ”breaks”.

When U(F (z = 0) = 1) > Umax = U(F = 1/γ) (that takes place, when α > γ),

in enough long bunch F becomes less than 1/γ, that is using in this paper cold ﬂuid

approach becomes inapplicable. Thus, in the cases −∞ < α < α1 and α > γ the uniform

bunch length can not exceed some value dmax;the wake amplitude in the case of d = dmax
is equal to ˜E. Dependence of the dmax on α for γ = 10 presented on Figure 2.

In the case of α1 ≤ α ≤ γ the uniform bunch length can be arbitrary. The ﬁeld inside

the bunch is periodical and has amplitude [5], [6]

Emb = [2(1 + α − Γ1/2/γ)]1/2/β.

(7)

Dependence of the wavelength inside the bunch Λb on α for γ ≫ 1 shown on Figure 3.

In the linear approach Emp ∼ α (|α| ≪ 1) and diﬀerences between the electron

bunch case and the positron one reduce to changing of electric ﬁeld sign (saying electron

or positron bunch we mean negatively or positively charged bunch, respectively).

In

nonlinear theory these diﬀerences are essential. The wavelength Λb in the electron bunch

increases as |α| increases when α1 < α < 0 (see Fig.3), and in the case γ ≫ 1 and α ≈

−0.5 is nearly equal to 8γ [3], [5], [6], that is much more than linear plasma wavelength.

In the positron bunch Λb decreases as α increases. Note, that diﬀerence of the nonlinear

wavelength from linear one, in the case γ ≫ 1 is palpable even for |α| ≪ 1. From (3),

(5) and the boundary conditions one can see, that F (z) ≥ 1 in the electron bunch, and

F (z) ≤ 1 in the positron bunch. That is, according to (2), βe(z) ≤ 0 in the electron

bunch and βe(z) ≥ 0 in the positron one.

density distributions in the bunch

Equation(1) was investigated numerically for uniform, parabolic and linear charge

αu = αu0,

5

αp = αp0[1 − (z − d/2)2]/(d/2)2,

αl = αl0|z|/d,

−d ≤ z ≤ 0.

(8)

Bunches with proﬁles (8), but with the same length and same total charge are compared.

That means |αp0| = (3/2)|αu0|, |αl0| = 2|αu0|.

Typical dependence of the wake wave amplitude Emp on bunch length for distributions

(8), in the case of periodical ﬁeld inside the uniform bunch (i.e. when α1 < αu0 < γ)

shown on Figure 4. For the uniform bunch this dependence is periodical (on Fig. 4 shown

one period only). The wake wave amplitude behind the uniform bunch is maximum and
equal to Emp = 2|αu0|γ/Γ1/2 [5], [6] when d = (n + 1/2)Λb (n is integer) and equal to

zero when d = nΛb. For the parabolic and linear proﬁles choice d ≈ (3/4)Λb is optimal.

One can see also, that in the case d > Λb the ”parabolic” bunches becomes less eﬀective

and the wake wave amplitude behind the bunch with linear proﬁle weakly depends on d.

For a short bunch (d < Λb/2) Emp(d) almost not depends on the bunch proﬁle.

4 Trains of Bunches

The results presented above demonstrates, that for the strong wake wave (with Emp ∼ ˜E)

excitation it is necessary relativistic either negatively charged bunch with α ≤ −0.5 or

positively charged bunch with α ≥ γ. However, on experiments density of bunches is

often much less of the plasma density, i.e.

|α| ≪ 1. Therefore, it is naturally to try

excite the strong waves by series of bunches. For the case of uniform bunches with

the same densities this problem was investigated analytically in [7]. The wake wave

amplitude behind the train of uniform bunches is maximum when di = (ni + 1/2)Λbi and

lj = (nj + 1/2)Λpj, where di is the length of i-th bunch, lj is the spacing between j-th

and (j + 1)-th bunches, Λbi is the wavelength in i-th bunch, Λpj is the wavelength behind

j-th bunch, ni and nj are integer. The wake wave amplitude behind such optimized train

6

depending on number of bunch N is [7]:

Emp(N) ≈ (2/β)sh(|α|βN), |α| ≪ 1.

(9)

(10)

From (9) follows, that the wave amplitude quickly grows as N increases and reaches the
value ˜E when

N ≈ (|α|β)−1 ln[(γ + 1)1/2/2 + (γ − 1)1/2/2].

The electric ﬁeld in the optimised train, obtained by numerical simulation of equation (1)

presented on Figure 5. The numerical results showed high exactness of the expressions

(9) and (10).

Often in experiments using trains of bunches with di = d = const, lj = l = const and

|α(z)| ≪ 1. Analytical discription of the ﬁelds excited in such trains is very diﬃcult.

The numerical simulation showed, that for proﬁles (8) in the case of d and l optimal for

ﬁrst bunch (see Sec. 3) the wake wave amplitude behind the train grows almost linearly

up to N = N∗ ∼ 0.5/|αu0|.Emp(N∗) increases as |αu0| and (or) γ increases. When the

wave becomes essentially nonlinear (when N ≥ N∗) coherence of the waves exciting by the

bunches breaking because of increasing of the wave length and the wave amplitude behind

train decreases almost up to zero as N increases. Dependence Emp(N) for N ≫ N∗ is

nearly periodical.

It was ascertained, that trains of short bunches (d ≪ Λb/2 and l ∼ Λp/2) are not

eﬀective as in this case Emp(N) ≤ Emp(1). When d ≪ Λb and l ≪ Λp the train behaves

as one bunch with averaged along the train length charge density.

5 Conclusions

The analytical and numerical results presented above throws light upon a number of

questions of the theory of strong plasma waves excited by charged bunches. This results

allow to choose parameters of the bunches optimal on future experiments.

The peculiarity of wake waves excitation by positively charged bunches are revealed.

In particular, it was discovered, that the nonlinear wavelength in uniform positively

7

charged bunch decreases as charge density increases.

For the excitation of wake wave with Emp ∼ ˜E more suitable is a bunch, consisting

of heavy particles (for example, protons), as light particles (electrons, positrons) lose

considerable part of their energy on length comparable with the bunch length. This is

easy to show by comparing of the bunch energy with the energy of wake wave.

Note, that the results presented in this paper are also suitable for the case of two-

dimensional cylindrical bunches with radius a when (γc/ωpa)2 ≪ 1 and r2 ≪ a2 [9].

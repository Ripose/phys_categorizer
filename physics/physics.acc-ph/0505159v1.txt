DYNAMICAL EFFECTS DUE TO FRINGE FIELD OF THE MAGNET IN
CIRCULAR ACCELERATORS∗

Y. Cai† , Y. Nosochkov, SLAC, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA

Abstract

The leading Lie generators, including the chromatic ef-
fects, due to hard-edge fringe ﬁeld of single multipole and
solenoid are derived from the vector potentials within a
Hamiltonian system. These nonlinear generators are ap-
plied to the interaction region of PEP-II to analyze the
linear errors due to the feed-down from the off-centered
quadrupoles and solenoid. The nonlinear effects of tune
shifts at large amplitude, the synchro-betatron sidebands
near half integer and their impacts on the dynamic aperture
are studied in the paper.

INTRODUCTION

PEP-II is an asymmetric B-factory that consists of two
separate rings with different energies. The electron and
positron beams are brought into head-on collisions at the
BABAR detector as shown in Fig. 1. In order to separate
the beams fast enough away from the interaction point (IP)
to avoid the deteriorating effect on the luminosity due to
adjacent parasitic collisions, the beams go through many
strong magnets inside the solenoid with very large offsets
from their center. These offsets can be as large as a few
centimeters as indicated in Fig. 1. The excursion of the de-
sign orbit introduces large uncertainty into the optics near
the IP. Most problematic, the optics changes, as recently
seen in the beam-beam experiments [1], when the local or-
bit varies.

An accurate optical model requires a map of three-
dimensional magnetic ﬁeld in the region. That is rather
difﬁcult to compute because of the overlapping ﬁelds and
complicated geometry. As a ﬁrst step, we will use the hard-
edge model for the fringe ﬁeld to estimate the effects ana-
lytically in this paper.

VECTOR POTENTIAL

The magnetic ﬁeld of a single normal harmonics, includ-
ing its fringe ﬁeld, in the cylindrical coordinate is derived
by Bassetti and Biscari [2]. To study the single-particle ef-
fects of the fringe ﬁeld using Hamiltonian system, we need
to know its corresponding vector potential.

Single normal harmonics, n > 0

expressed as

For a skew multipole, the expression can be obtained by
an exchange between sine and cosine. The Coulomb gauge
is chosen because its potential becomes the conventional
multipole expansion.

Solenoid, n = 0

For the solenoid, due to its axial symmetry, it is more
convenient to choose the axial gauge: As = 0. The vector
potential is given by

The potential satisﬁes Maxwell’s equation ∇ × ∇ × ~A =
0. Any truncation of the series could violate Maxwell’s
equation. The magnetic ﬁeld is given by ~B = ∇ × ~A.

HARD-EDGE FRINGE

Dipole

In the Cartesian coordinate system, the Hamiltonian, us-
ing the distance s as the independent variable for a charged
particle moving in a static magnetic ﬁeld, is given by [3]

H(x, px, y, py, δ, l; s) = −as

−q(1 + δ)2 − (px − ax)2 − (py − ay)2,

(4)

where ax,y,s = eAx,y,s/cp0 are scaled components of the
vector potential along axis x,y,s, respectively; px, px are the
transverse canonical momenta scaled by a reference mo-
mentum p0, δ = (p − p0)/p0, and l = vt is the path length.
We expand the square root in Eq. (4) and keep only the ﬁrst
order of the vector potential,

H = −(1 + δ) +

(p2

Similarly, for a dipole magnet, we start with

G1,0 = B0θ(s),

(11)

and set n = 1 in Eq. (1) to obtain the components of the
vector potential of a dipole magnet as follows

Ax =

(x2 − y2){

Ay = xy{

where B0 is the magnetic ﬁeld of the dipole. The Hamil-
tonian is derived by substituting the vector potential into
Eq. (5). We have

−[as +

(pxax + pyay)].

H = D + V0θ(s) + V1θ

This Hamiltonian is used to compute the dynamical effects
on the charged particles due to the fringe ﬁeld.

Solenoid

Taking a solenoid with ﬁeld Bs as an example and follow
the method used by Forest and Milutinovic [5], we choose
a hard-edge model

G0,1 = Bsθ(s),

where θ(s) is the unit step function. Using this model and
the vector potential in Eq. (3), we have, As = 0 and

(14)

where,

fd =

As a ﬁrst-order kick and δ = 0, it agrees with the expres-
sion found by Papaphilippou, Wei, and Talman [4].

Ms = e:[V2,D]: = e:fs:,

where

fs =

(10)

Here, : f : g = [f, g] and [ , ] denotes the Poisson bracket.
Note that Ms is invariant under the two-dimensional rota-
tion around the axis of the solenoid.

Similar exercise can be carried out for a quadrupole mag-

net with n = 2. The ﬁnal map is given by

Mq = e:fq:,

(16)

where,

fq =

12(1 + δ)

[−(x3 + 3xy3)px + (y3 + 3yx2)py]. (17)

where K1 = eG/cp0 and G is the gradient. Mq agrees
with the expression ﬁrst found by Forest and Milutinovic.
Here, the maps are derived for the raising edge of the
magnet. For the falling edge, the maps are obtained by
simply switching the sign of the Lie generator of the map.
If there is a design off-axis orbit: ∆x and ∆px in the
horizontal plane, the non-linear effects of the fringe ﬁeld of

a quadrupole magnet will feed down to linear optical errors.
By substituting x with x + ∆x and px with px + ∆px into
Eq. (17), and extracting the quadratic terms of x, px, y, py,
we ﬁnd that the tune shifts are given by

∆νx =

(∆x∆pxβx − ∆x2αx),

(∆x∆pxβy + ∆x2αy),

(18)

where β and α are the Courant-Snyder parameters at the
position of the edge. For PEP-II, the estimated tune shifts
in the vertical plane relative to the design orbit in the Low
Energy Ring are tabulated in Table 1.

Note that the outside edges of the quadrupole contribute
more because the excursions are larger. These rather large
optical effects are not currently included in our optical
model.

NONLINEAR EFFECTS

The nonlinear fringe transformation at quadrupole edges
has been recently implemented in the LEGO code [6].
Based on Eq. (17), the fringe octupole-like ﬁeld would gen-
erate an amplitude dependent tune shift and excite chromo-
geometric octupole resonances. These effects were ob-
served in PEP-II dynamic aperture calculations. To maxi-
mize luminosity, the PEP-II horizontal tune is moved close
to a half-integer. However, the tune space in this region
is limited by the effects of half-integer resonance and its
synchrotron side bands. The effect of the quadrupole res-
onances on PEP-II dynamic aperture had been observed in
earlier tracking studies [7]. In this case, the resonance con-
dition is 2νx +kνs = n, where νs is the synchrotron tune.

After including the nonlinear fringe in quadrupoles, the
tracking showed a reduction of dynamic aperture for off-

∗

∗

/βy

momentum particles. An example of dynamic aperture for
PEP-II High Energy Ring (HER) is shown in Fig. 2.
In
this case, the 90◦ HER upgrade lattice [8] is used where
= 50/1 cm
the IP beta functions and tunes are βx
and νx/νy/νs = 28.51/27.63/0.0405. The tracking in-
cluded synchrotron oscillations, machine errors and var-
ious optics corrections.
In Fig. 2, the blue dotted lines
show on-momentum dynamic aperture for 10 random er-
ror settings, the dash red lines correspond to relative mo-
mentum error of δ = 8σδ, and the solid ellipse shows the
10σ beam size for reference. One can see that the fringe
effect increases the on-momentum aperture but reduces the
horizontal off-momentum aperture at .510 tune. The on-
momentum improvement is due to the fringe compensation
of the amplitude dependent tune shift from sextupoles. The
off-momentum effect was attributed to the 1st octupole side
band of the half-integer resonance excited by the fringe. In
this case, the octupole resonance condition 4νx +lνs = 114
yields the resonance tune at νx = 28.5101. Moving the tune
away from this resonance to 28.518 restored the aperture
above the 10σ size.

CONCLUSION

We have found a new Lie generator for the hard-edge
fringe due to a solenoid magnet. It is a fourth-order gener-
ator and gives an octupole-like kick to charge particles. It
can also provide additional x-y couplings through an off-
centered orbit.

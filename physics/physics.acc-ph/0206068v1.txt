Abstract

Compensation of optics errors at the Interaction Point (IP) is essential for maintaining max-
imum luminosity at the NLC. Several correction systems (knobs) using the Final Focus sex-
tupoles have been designed to provide orthogonal compensation of linear and the second
order optics aberrations at IP. Tuning effects of these knobs on the 250 GeV beam were
veriﬁed using tracking simulations.

Abstract

Compensation of optics errors at the Interaction Point
(IP) is essential for maintaining maximum luminosity at the
NLC. Several correction systems (knobs) using the Final
Focus sextupoles have been designed to provide orthogonal
compensation of linear and the second order optics aberra-
tions at IP. Tuning effects of these knobs on the 250 GeV
beam were veriﬁed using tracking simulations.

INTRODUCTION

The NLC Final Focus (FFS) optics [1] is designed to pro-
duce a very small vertical beam size of 3 nm at the Interac-
tion Point (IP) in 500 GeV cms collisions. To attain these
small spots, the NLC FFS design includes a number of non-
linear elements; the optics for the NLC FFS is shown in
Fig. 1, where sextupoles are denoted with ﬁrst letter “S”,
octupoles with “O”, and decapoles with “D”. These correc-
tors are used to compensate the high-order geometric and
chromatic effects generated in the nominal FFS optics as
well as fold the beam halo in on itself to reduce the number
of large amplitude halo particles [2].

Unfortunately, alignment and ﬁeld errors in the FFS are
ampliﬁed by the strong focusing and may lead to enlarge-
ment of IP beam size and subsequent luminosity loss. To
maintain the maximum luminosity, aberrations increasing
the beam size at IP have to be corrected. The correction
procedure envisioned for the NLC FFS is very similar to
that implemented on the Stanford Linear Collider (SLC)
FFS or the Final Focus Test Beam (FFTB) [3]:

1. the quadrupoles are aligned using beam-based align-

ment techniques such as the shunting method,

2. the sextupoles are aligned in a similar manner,

3. trajectories are ﬁt to verify the ﬁrst-order optics and

ﬁx the phase advance between sextupoles,

4. the sextupoles are set to minimize the chromaticity,

5. global tuning correctors (knobs) are used to tune both
the ﬁrst-order and the nonlinear corrections using lu-
minosity measurements.

In the following, we describe a set of simple correction
system (knobs) using a minimum number of magnets for
independent control of individual IP aberrations. The knob
correctors are located at optimum optical positions close to
the IP to minimize the extent of optics perturbation. Several
knobs based on the FFS sextupoles have beed designed to
correct linear and the second order optical aberrations at
the IP.

2 LINEAR KNOBS

Five knobs have been designed to correct the following
linear aberrations at the IP: longitudinal position of hori-
zontal (x) and vertical (y) beta waist, x and y dispersion,
and x-y coupling. Correction of the ﬁrst order aberrations
requires adjustment of the normal and skew quadrupole
ﬁeld in the FFS. Similar to tuning techniques at the SLC [4]
and the FFTB, we used x, y offsets of the FFS sextupoles
to make these knobs. One can verify that a sextupole dis-
placed by ∆x and ∆y generates the following low order
ﬁeld on the reference orbit:

∆K1n = −K2∆x, ∆K1s = K2∆y,

(3)

∂mBy
respectively, where Km = 1
∂xm and Bρ is the mag-
Bρ
netic rigidity. The last terms in Eqn. 1, 2 lead to additional
orbit, quadratic in ∆x, ∆y, which may be not negligible
for large offsets, however, it is assumed that this orbit will
be cancelled by the IP steering correctors. Correction efﬁ-
ciency of the FFS sextupoles is enhanced by the large beta
functions and phase advance of ∆µs = π/2+nπ from IP.

2.1 Waist and Horizontal Dispersion

Enlargement of IP beam size and subsequent luminos-
ity loss may be caused by longitudinal displacement ∆s
of focusing waist and residual horizontal dispersion ∆η∗
x
at IP. The waist displacement increases IP beta function as

1

β = β∗+∆s2
β∗ , where β∗ is the ideal beta at IP. For maximum
luminosity, waist position has to be kept within ∆s ≪ β∗.
The beta waist and horizontal dispersion knobs have
been constructed using horizontal sextupole offsets. Ac-
cording to Eqn. 3, ∆x creates a normal quadrupole ﬁeld
which distorts βx,y and ηx functions. Beta perturbation
propagates to the IP and for ∆µs = π/2 + nπ results in
a longitudinal shift of the beta waist. The shift caused by a
single sextupole is approximately

where L and βs are the sextupole length and beta function.
As shown in Fig. 1, the dispersion ηs
x is not zero in most of
the FFS sextupoles, therefore ∆x also generates horizontal
dispersion at IP:

x = K2L∆x ηs

Three sextupoles are required to construct three orthog-
onal knobs for the ∆sx,y and ∆η∗
In each
knob, the sextupole offsets are varied linearly with the ﬁxed
scale factors to produce a desired amplitude of the aberra-
tion. The scale factors for ∆x offsets are listed in Table 1.
Note that two sextupoles are sufﬁcient for ∆sy and ∆η∗
x
knobs for the following reasons. In the ﬁrst case, the ratio
ηs
βs
x at SD0 and SF1 is about constant which results
x/
in correction of ∆η∗
x when ∆sx is corrected. In the second
case, the −I transformation between SF5 and SF6 makes
it possible to cancel ∆sx and ∆sy with one scale factor.

MAD [5] calculations show the following effects from
these knobs: ∆sx ≈ −3122 ∆xSD0, ∆sy ≈ −60.36 ∆xSD0,
∆η∗
x ≈ −0.4981 ∆xSF5. It is expected that x, y resolution
of sextupole movers will be close to 50 nm which is suf-
ﬁcient for accurate tuning of ∆sx,y and ∆η∗
x – if desired,
the magnet could be split onto two movers which would
effectively reduce the required resolution.

2.2 Vertical Dispersion and Coupling

Orthogonal knobs to correct the vertical dispersion and
betatron coupling at IP have been constructed using vertical
sextupole offsets. The ∆y offsets create a skew quadrupole
ﬁeld which couples the x and y motion. Vertical dispersion
at IP, caused by a single sextupole, is given by

∆η

y = −K2L∆y ηs

(6)

In general, betatron coupling is described by four orthog-
onal matrix terms which can be independently tuned at IP
using four skew quadrupoles located at the following phase
advance from IP: [∆µx, ∆µy] = [0, 0], [ π
2 ].
However, by design, all FFS sextupoles are located at
∆µs
x,y = π/2 + nπ from IP, and hence only one coupling

2 , 0], [0, π

2 ], [ π

2 , π

term can be created using the sextupoles. Regardless, this
is the dominant coupling term in the FFS since most aber-
rations will be created by quadrupoles with the largest beta
functions which are at the same phase as the sextupoles.
The remaining three coupling terms can be compensated
using three additional skew quadrupoles in the FFS sys-
tem. So far, it has been found that the effect of the three
minor terms is rather small and there is a full 4-D coupling
correction section upstream of the beam delivery system.

Two sextupoles were used in the knobs for vertical dis-
persion and coupling as shown in Table 2, where the scale
factors for ∆y are listed. The SD0, SD4 offsets cancel ver-
tical dispersion and create coupling, while SF5 and SF6,
located −I apart, do the opposite. The effect of ∆η∗
y knob
is estimated to be about ∆η∗
y ≈ 0.06918 ∆ySF5. This pro-
duces noticeable enlargement of vertical beam size when
∆ySF 5 is a few microns. The beam sensitivity is much
greater to the coupling knob, where an offset of ∆ySD0 =
0.5 µm increases the IP vertical beam size by a factor of
three. This enlargement is roughly linear with ∆y and it
implies tight tolerances on the sextupole vertical alignment.

Simulations

x/σ∗

Spot size tuning using the linear knobs has been tested
in tracking simulations using DIMAD [6] and MATLAB-
LIAR [7] codes. The FFS design for 250 GeV beam was
used where the unperturbed beam size at IP is σ∗
y =
243/3.00 nm. In the tests, the nominal IP beam emittances
were used for injection into the FFS rather than the smaller
design emittances which include allowances for tuning er-
rors, aberrations, and emittance dilutions. Select errors
were applied to the FFS magnets which caused enlarge-
ment of the IP beam size, and then the knobs were used to
minimize this increase. In a typical simulation, 2000 parti-
cles were tracked through the collimation and FFS sections
with the initial gaussian distribution in phase space and a
double-horned distribution for the energy spread. Emit-
tance growth due to synchrotron radiation in the bending
magnets and quadrupoles was included in the DIMAD sim-
ulations which also causes a slight increase in the nomi-
nal IP beam sizes. The knob tuning was done manually in
DIMAD and an automatic routine was used in MATLAB-
LIAR. Two of the tests are presented below, although more
cases have been studied.

In the ﬁrst test, a gradient error of ∆K1

K1 = 10−4 was ap-
plied to the ﬁnal doublet quadrupole QF1. According to
MAD, this results in IP waist offsets and horizontal disper-
sion as follows: ∆sx = −4.769 mm, ∆sy = 0.134 mm, and
∆η∗
x = 44.8 µm. In this case, the ∆sx,y values are com-
parable with the IP beta functions β∗
y = 8/0.11 mm.
Analytically, this increases σ∗
x, σ∗
y by 16% and 58%, re-
spectively. In addition, ∆η∗
x enlarges the horizontal size

x/β∗

2

by about 12%. To compensate this error, beta waist and
horizontal dispersion knobs were used in the simulations.
The results of this correction using DIMAD are presented
in Table 3, where x∗, y∗ are beam offsets at IP. The correct-
ing sextupole offsets were: ∆xSD0 = 0.48, ∆xSF 1 = 0.295,
∆xSF 5 = 84.05, ∆xSF 6 = 32.34 µm. The SF5, SF6 offsets
are large enough to create a non-negligible orbit x∗ which
could be corrected using the FFS steering correctors. Sim-
ilar results were obtained using MATLAB-LIAR.

In the second test, an x-y rotation error ∆θ = 10−4
was applied to the ﬁnal doublet quadrupole QD0. This
generates two dominant aberrations at IP: vertical disper-
sion and coupling. The results of DIMAD simulations
are listed in Table 4, and the correcting sextupole offsets
are: ∆xSD0 = −2.87, ∆xSD4 = −7.60, ∆xSF 5 = −215,
∆xSF 6 = −56.1 µm. The corresponding IP distribution is
shown in Fig. 2. Note that the uncorrected σ∗
y is very large
in this case which implies tight tolerances on rotation errors
in the ﬁnal doublet and necessity for their compensation.

More tests have been done using random rotation errors
in all quadrupoles in the collimation and FFS sections. It
has been found that the knob correction is capable of reduc-
ing σ∗
y enlargement to about 2% from an uncorrected size
of 10σ∗
y. For larger errors, the compensation is poorer, pos-
sibly due to effects such as chromatic coupling and emit-
tance dilution.

3 SECOND ORDER KNOBS

Taking into account the small σ∗

y at the NLC, enlarge-
ment of IP beam size due to high-order aberrations may
also be signiﬁcant. The FFS sextupoles, octupoles and de-
capoles may be used to create non-linear correction knobs.

Since all of the FFS sextupoles are located at the same
phase from IP (π/2+nπ), they create only limited number
of second order aberrations at IP. At present, four approx-
imately orthogonal knobs have been constructed using six
variable sextupole strengths to generate the projected sec-
ond order terms at IP: T122, T166, T342 and T364. Note that
T122, T166 affect σ∗
y. The knobs
have been designed using MAD matching routine. Their
effect can be analytically estimated by constructing the thin
lens second-order matrix containing the desired terms and
applying it to the IP phase space.

An example of the second-order correction is presented
in Table 5 and Fig. 3, where the strength error ∆K2
K2 = 10−2
was applied to the SD0 sextupole. MATLAB-LIAR sim-
ulations also showed good compensation in another test,
where random strength errors were applied to ﬁve FFS sex-
tupoles with rms value of ∆K2
K2 = 3·10−3.

4 CONCLUSION
A set of knobs based on the FFS sextupoles have been
designed to correct linear and second-order aberrations at
the IP. These knobs have been tested in numerical simula-
tions for several FFS errors and satisfactory compensation
has been achieved. Additional high-order knobs are under
study. Further simulations will be needed to investigate the
error range for an acceptable knob correction and to de-
velop a practical strategy for the beam measurement and
knob compensation.

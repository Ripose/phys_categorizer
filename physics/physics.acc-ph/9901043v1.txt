The relationship between the level of spin polarisation caused by Un-
ruh radiation as calculated by Bell and Leinaas and that obtained from
the Derbenev–Kondratenko formalism is explained.

1 Introduction

In 1986 in the course of investigating quantum ﬂuctuations in accelerated reference
frames and striving to assign spin temperatures, Bell and Leinaas (BL) [1] found that
in a perfectly aligned, azimuthally uniform, weak focussing electron storage ring, the
electron polarisation antiparallel to the dipole ﬁeld is given by the formula

ν2) and ν = aγ b.

Over most of the energy range Peq is 8/5√3 i.e. 92.4%. But as one approaches
the resonance point Qz = ν from below, the polarisation dips to
17% and then
rises through zero at the resonance energy to reach 99.2% before levelling oﬀ again
at 92.4%.

Such behaviour is not exhibited in the DKM formula (Article I, Eq. (36)) which
is based on a calculation of spin motion driven by synchrotron radiation emission in
the laboratory frame. Indeed, in a perfectly aligned ﬂat storage ring ∂ˆn/∂δ is zero
and the polarisation is 92.4% independently of energy. At the time, the BL result
caused considerable surprise and baﬄement in the accelerator community.

2 The solution

However, the BL eﬀect can be accommodated within the DKM formalism and we
were able to provide a detailed treatment [2]. The full story can be found in [2, 3] so
that here, owing to space limitations, I will be exceedingly brief.

BL were primarily concerned with the eﬀect of vertical orbit ﬂuctuations driven
by the background Unruh radiation [4]. In the laboratory frame these ﬂuctuations
stem from the fact that synchrotron radiation photons are emitted at a small angle of

order 1/γ with respect to the horizontal plane and thus cause the particles to recoil
vertically. This must also be taken into account when considering the change in the
ˆn axis under photon emission (Article I, Eq. (35)) and the DKM formula for the
polarisation along ˆn then becomes:

If ∂ˆn/∂δ is zero as in the BL ring, the terms containing the very small quantity

Thus we have recovered the BL result except for the extra piece 2/γ. Near to
the resonance this is negligible compared to the resonance term and so near to the
resonance we may consider the two results to be in agreement. Thus the vertical kicks
imparted to the orbit by the Unruh radiation of BL have been identiﬁed with vertical
recoils caused by synchrotron radiation.

Further instructive interpretations of synchrotron radiation can be found in [5, 6].
In [6] synchrotron radiation emission is considered to result from ‘inverse Compton
scattering’ of electrons from the virtual photons of the deﬂecting magnetic ﬁeld and
the spin dependent Compton cross–section is used to obtain the radiation distribution.
It would be interesting to see if an extension of this calculation emphasising spin eﬀects
could simulate the Sokolov–Ternov eﬀect.

I thank S. R. Mane for fruitful collaboration on this and other aspects of spin po-
larisation in storage rings. I would like to thank J.D. Jackson, W. G. Unruh and H.
Rosu for useful exchanges of ideas.

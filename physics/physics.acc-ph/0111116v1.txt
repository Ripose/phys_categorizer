INTRODUCTION

to 4 inputs

Abstract

At BESSY the standard 16 bit resolution of the corrector
power supplies was insufﬁcient for the continuous orbit
drift correction [1]. A new sophisticated design of the ana-
log/digital I/O board [3] increases the resolution of the ana-
log output up to 24 bits without suffering on losses in the
long term stability or the dynamic range of the correctors.
This is achieved by a cost-efﬁcient board design using stan-
dard 16 bit DAC devices in a range-overlapping ﬁne/coarse
architecture.

The third generation light source BESSY II started op-
eration equipped with power supplies using low thermal
drift 16 Bit DAC devices. First experiences with the im-
plemented SVD based automatic orbit correction scheme
showed that the 16 bit resolution of the power supplies was
not sufﬁcient to correct the orbit without unacceptable in-
ﬂuences to speciﬁc experiments[1].
A typical solution to solve this problem is to reduce the
dynamic range of the correctors. A single bit of the DAC
device then represents a smaller current step of the correc-
tor power supply output. The obvious disadvantage of this
solution is that large kicks and bumps are not achievable.
This leads to an inacceptably restricted use of the power
supplies for diagnostic and recalibration purposes.
To avoid the disadvantages of a reduced dynamic range a
new I/O board with an increased DAC channel resolution
of up to 24 bits has been introduced.

24 BIT DAC BOARD DESIGN

2.1 Compatibility Demands

At BESSY the power supplies are CAN bus controllable.
Therefore an I/O board,
together with a piggy back
embedded controller including the CAN bus interface,
is plugged directly into the power supply. This board
combination provides the whole functionality needed for
low level control of a typical power supply[3].

Forschung und Technologie (BMBF) and the Land Berlin

Taking this into account, a new 24 bit I/O board,
ADA2x16-IO8, has been developed1. The design has the
same form factor as the former 16 bit I/O board. The new
board is fully compatible to the former design and consists
of:

• 8 digital inputs and 8 digital outputs

• a 24 bit analog output

• a fast 16 bit ﬂash ADC, multiplexed to 4 inputs

• a slow dual slope ± 15 bit + sign ADC, multiplexed

• a connector to house the BESSY embedded controller

including a CAN bus interface

• a conﬁgurable bus interface unit supporting several

bus types (e.g. ISA96, VME)

2.2 Analog Output Stage Design

The long term stability of the corrector power supplies di-
rectly affects the static orbit stability of the BESSY II stor-
age ring. This requires a high stability analog stage with
low thermal drifts (in our case typically 1.5 ppm / ◦C or
better) for the I/O board. The long term stability depends
mainly on the drift of the voltage reference and the DAC
output. The signiﬁcant differences in thermal drifts of typ-
ical DACs available on the market are shown in Table 1.

design of the 24 bit DAC board is based on a combination
of two low thermal drift 16 bit DAC devices. A range-
overlapping architecture is used to accomplish the 24 bit
resolution (see Figure 1). The 16 bit DAC devices are the
same as in the design of the 16 bit board. The higher 8
bits of DAC1 are used for coarse setting and the 16 bits of
DAC2 for ﬁne setting. The lower 8 bits of DAC1 are avail-
able to linearize the relative accuracy or endpoint nonlin-
earity of the 24 bit output if needed (in our case this feature
is not used).

Digital Setting

Figure 1: 24 Bit DAC Stage Principle

Critical in this design is the transition point between the
two 16 bit DAC devices (e.g. bit 16 switches to one and
bits 0..15 are switching to zero). This directly affects the
differential nonlinearity and therefore the monotonicity of
the design. In our case the board is calibrated to provide
monotonicity up to 17 bits resolution. Considering a full
scale range of ± 10 V a single bit of 24 bit resolution rep-
resents 1.192 µV and 17 bit represents 152.59 µV; i.e. the
design is calibrated to be monotonic for relative settings
down to 152.59 µV or better.

2.3 Measurements

Figure 2 shows the measured relative output steps of one
randomly selected 24 bit DAC when the input is incre-
mented by steps of 25 digits, which is equivalent to a 19

tion mode, every relative output step of the DAC should
be 38.15 µV. In Figure 3 the majority of measured output
steps are in the 38.15 µV region and only some few are in
the 152.59 µV region.
Because of these encouraging measurement results we ex-
pected signiﬁcant improvements regarding the resolution
of the corrector power supplies and therefore performance
improvements of the orbit correction scheme.

3 PERFORMANCE

After installation of the ADA2x16-IO8 24 bit DAC boards,
ﬁrst tests with the SVD based orbit correction scheme have
been done using different resolutions for the setting. Figure
4 shows the FFT performed over the resulting time depen-
dent vertical beam position data of all beam position moni-
tors (BPMs). A drastically reduced orbit drift could be seen
when the resolution was increased from 16 bit to 18 resp.
20 bit [2].

4 CONCLUSION

The new 24 bit design of the analog/digital I/O board pro-
vides the higher resolution needed for the correctors of the
third generation light source BESSY II. Due to the range-
overlapping architecture of the board using the low thermal
drift 16 bit DAC devices, the known static orbit stability

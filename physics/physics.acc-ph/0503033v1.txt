Abstract

The properties of coherent beamstrahlung (CB) in the microwave part of the spectrum, as well

as its usage, are introduced. Some of its features are remarkable, and they include background-

free detection, passive, precision measurement of the beam-beam oﬀset and beam length, and

measurement of the ratio of the beams transverse widths.

INTRODUCTION.

The problem of achieving and maintaining beam-beam collisions (BBC) at the Interna-

tional Linear Collider (ILC) ranks as possibly the greatest technical challenge in a project

full of daunting technical challenges.

It is not diﬃcult to see why. For the purpose of counting degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) in

the BBC, each beam has an average direction in space, a charge population N1,2, and a mean

beam energy E1,2. These eight quantities can be monitored accurately with a combination

of beam position monitors and energy spectrometers.

In the following, if related beam

quantities are equal, the indices are dropped, i.e., N1 = N2 = N.

Next to these d.o.f , one has seven quantities, depicted in Fig. 1, that belong in the

plane transverse to the beam-beam axis. These quantities are the minimum number of

transverse parameters, under the hypothesis that the beams be Gaussian (GH) in both

transverse dimensions. There are four transverse beam widths, one in x and one in y for

each beam, plus two oﬀsets, one in x and one in y, and one beam rotation.

It is these

quantities that dominate the beam-beam luminosity for a particular collision, since they

specify geometrically whether two beams “hit” or “miss” each other.

Continuing the count of the degrees of freedom, one then has two beam lengths σz1

and σz2 (again under GH). The beam lengths do not enter directly in the determination

of luminosity but both the beam disruption and the total radiated beamstrahlung power

depend on the beam length. The beam length is famously diﬃcult to monitor, specially in

the sub-millimeter case of the ILC.

In momentum space, there are at least four angular parameters in the two beams angular

distributions (under angular GH), but of particular interest is the luminosity-weighted en-

ergy distribution, dL/dE, which is non-Gaussian, strongly depends on beamstrahlung and

signiﬁcantly impacts the physics output. By measuring the beam geometrical parameters

one can constrain the expectation value for the beamstrahlung yield, so that multiple BBC

monitoring inevitably results in beneﬁts other than luminosity. This papers mostly concerns

itself with the measurement of geometrical beam-beam parameters.

So, there are at least 21 degrees of freedom in the BBC under the benign assumption that

the beams be exactly Gaussian in space and reasonably narrow in the energy distribution

of the incoming beams. Compounding the problem, some of these d.o.f will jitter from one

collision to the next, and all are expected to drift (to change slowly and continuously over

Further degrees of freedom include extra parameters specifying the beams spatial distri-

butions as they deviate from pure 3-D Gaussian distributions. Wake ﬁelds are expected to

play a role at the ILC, and that means the beams will be transversely asymmetric with the

head and the tail of the beam being diﬀerent (“banana beams”).

It is evident that the BBC needs to be observed in as many ways as possible. Pulse-

to-pulse measurements, and passive measurements that do not require that the beams be

scanned, are at a premium. Multiple measurements of the same quantity may be useful,

but they will be most useful if they have diﬀerent sensitivity to diﬀerent beam shapes (e.g.,

symmetrical versus asymmetrical). The hypothesis of diﬀerent sensitivities to diﬀerent beam

shapes for diﬀerent BBC observables is likely but it has not been proven or studied so far.

Measurements should be available both during the commissioning phase, when beams have

a brightness perhaps 1% of nominal, and the beam-beam interaction is relatively weak.

Techniques to monitor the BBC were developed at the SLC and have been studied for

the ILC. Amongst them the beam-beam deﬂection technique, invented by P. Bambade[1],

and recently studied by the authors of Ref.[2] in regard to a future linear collider. This

technique, when used passively, is limited to the measurement of two degrees of freedom,

due to Newton’s Third Law equating the force exerted by each beam on the other.

The study of the high energy part of the beamstrahlung spectrum would provide informa-

tion about the BBC through the overall radiated power, its angular direction and spread[3]

(three quantities for each beam). This technique potentially provides six d.o.f though it is

unclear whether the information is completely independent. For example, all six quantities

increase when the beams develop an oﬀset in y.

In the last few years a new way to measure the BBC has been invented at Wayne State[4]

and is currently under development[5] at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring, CESR. It fo-

cusses on the large angle part of the beamstrahlung radiation[6]. The interest of studying

that part of the radiation is that the beamstrahlung polarization information can be ob-

tained.

The device eﬀectively provides four d.o.f on a pulse-to-pulse basis, and up to six d.o.f

when the beam drift is considered[6]. The basic idea underlying the technique is that

polarization is best observed at lower wavelengths, and also that one can recover 100%

of the polarization information due to the special synchrotron radiation (SR) spectrum at

large angles[7]. Background reduction is achieved almost entirely due to the much higher

angular spread of beamstrahlung, compared to the synchrotron radiation coming from the

many accelerator magnets[5],[8].

Besides its many strengths, this technique has already shown itself to be one that turns
on very slowly, due to its overall N 3 dependence[6]. That makes it a poor candidate to

study the BBC during the ILC commissioning phase. For reasons that will become clear in

a moment, this type of monitoring is termed incoherent beamstrahlung (IB).

With this paper the usage of coherent beamstrahlung (CB) is proposed, and its observa-

tional capabilities are discussed for the ﬁrst time. This regime is dramatically diﬀerent from

IB because the whole beam behaves as a single particle. As shown in Sect. III, coherence

sets in when one observes beamstrahlung at wavelengths exceeding the beam length, AND

when the beams are oﬀset in any transverse direction. When beamstrahlung is coherent,

the radiation is enhanced by the factor N

O(1010) which is very large.

CB is a new method with its own strengths, many of which are unlike any of the other

methods. These strengths include very rapid turn-on, a large signal very nearly free of

background, the direct measurement of the two beam lengths, and the capability to measure

beam-beam vertical jitter to better than 0.01σy.

In the past, Ref.[9] has discussed the

possibility of measuring the radiation of one beam interacting with the wake ﬁeld of the

other beam. He termed this radiation “coherent beamstrahlung” as well, though in this

paper the radiation coming from the BBC alone is considered.

Section II discusses coherent radiation in the case of synchrotron radiation in general and

beamstrahlung in particular. Section III presents some simulation results. The results focus

on the usage of CB during commissioning, when beams are weakest. A Table provides the

CB rates for weak and nominal beams. Section IV discusses a simple method of detection

and the backgrounds.

II.

INCOHERENT AND COHERENT LIMIT FOR LOW ENERGY RADIATION.

Beamstrahlung is just another form of SR. Its diﬀerences with the usual kind of SR are
the extremely high magnetic ﬁeld B (105T at the ILC) and the extremely short magnet

length L (0.6mm= 2σz at the ILC). The SR critical energy is directly proportional to B, so

the former diﬀerence was used as the main discrimination against SR backgrounds at the

SLC[10]. The latter diﬀerence is being used to discriminate against SR at CESR, because a

short magnet radiates at larger angles than a long magnet[7].

This Section is qualitative in nature, for the purpose of introducing coherent beam-

strahlung (as well as the lack of coherent synchrotron radiation from magnets). Quanti-

tative results are available in the next Section. The basis of this Section is the brilliant

discussion of coherence and incoherence in radiating beams, by Panofsky and Phillips[11].

That discussion is extended to show four things,

why, in practice, coherent synchrotron radiation is never observed when a beam crosses

•

•

•

•

a magnet (except for small fringe eﬀects[12])

why the beams need to be oﬀset for CB to be present,

why, in practice, CB is entirely polarized along the y

axis, and

−

how CB propagates in the physical environment of a vacuum beam pipe.

5

In Ref.[11], the spatial distribution of electrons in a ring is studied with respect to the

radiation wavelength and electron multiplicity.

If only one electron is present, coherent

and incoherent radiation are the same.

If N electrons are present, the vector potentials

(which have a wave-like form) of each electron must be superposed. In practice one can also

superpose the electric ﬁeld vectors or the force vectors, which are the techniques adopted in

this paper.

After superposition, constructive or destructive interference may arise. If electrons are

forced into a highly uniform distribution, such as in a metallic wire loop, destructive inter-

ference arises and the ring will not radiate at wavelengths exceeding the electron spacing. If
constructive interference is present, the radiation will be proportional to N 2.

In the case of interest here, electrons are free and they radiate because of density ﬂuctua-

tions in the electron bunch. The ﬂuctuations are of order √N, and they radiate coherently,

so that the radiated power U

= N. The bunch radiates as the sum of the ra-

2

√N

∝

diation intensities, and the mean radiation loss per electron is equal to that of a single

electron[11]. This radiation is incoherent. If the electrons are free, incoherent radiation can

not be eliminated, even when the superposition is largely destructive.

In most practical synchrotron radiation applications one is interested in the photons with

wavelengths λ << σz, so that the same argument holds, that is, superposition happens

within the beam and must produce incoherent radiation. That is certainly true of beam-

strahlung as well. Fig. 2 illustrates how the forward waves interfere destructively, save for

the aforementioned statistical ﬂuctuations. Particle are assumed to be in phase with their
radiation since their velocity diﬀers from the speed of light by less than one part in 1012 at

the ILC.

Consider next a bunch of length σz crossing a magnet of length L (this problem was

already partially addressed in Ref.[8]), σz << L. What happens to the wavelengths L >

λ > σz? In those cases, the beam is spatially in phase with the emitted wave but emits also

at a later time (Fig. 3), for example after a distance λ/2 has been covered. Again one sees

that waves tend to cancel, leaving only the incoherent part. So for all wavelengths shorter

than L the radiation is incoherent.

What happens in the limit L << λ (Fig. 4)? Here radiation is truly coherent, but in

practice very diﬃcult to observe. Beam pipes have typical diameters of centimeters, and

magnets have lengths of order meters. In practice these waves are absorbed in the pipe within

centimeters of the point of production and the superposition of many waves (that produces

coherence) never develops. Given a beam pipe of diameter d, the microwave propagation

cutoﬀ is λ = 2d[13]-[14]. However, for λ > d, the attenuation is typically at 0.01 dB per

meter[13]-[14], so that for those frequencies microwaves can travel to a distant device and

be detected.

One sees that there are constraints on the detection of coherent radiation at an accelerator.

First, both the beam and the magnet have to be less than λ. This is not a problem for

beamstrahlung, since beam and magnet (which is the other beam) have approximately the

same length. Second, in practice the radiation has to propagate through a beam pipe of

diameter d to a distant detector. That is possible only if λ < d. Therefore, coherent

beamstrahlung can be studied if

d > λ > σz.

(1)

At the ILC, σz = 0.3mm and d = 2.5cm, and a large window for detection exists. We

note that, with σz being about 1% of d, a free radiation approximation is warranted, unlike

the CESR case discussed below. This approximation will be valid for wavelengths of order

of σz or slightly larger. Wavelengths of order d will inevitably propagate in waveguide mode,

therefore aﬀecting to some degree the beam position monitors, as well as other instrumenta-

tion, downstream. This is a problem but not necessarily an unsolvable one. The waveguide

mode will propagate more slowly than the beam itself, so that the beam induced pulse and

CB could conceivably be time-resolved.

At existing accelerators, in some cases detection is impossible. For example, at the

Tevatron the beams have σz ∼
At CESR, σz = 9 millimeters. The beam pipe near the IP has a diameter of d = 2.5 cm,

0.6 meters, and the beam pipe has a diameter d = 5 cm.

extending for 60 cm away from the IP. From there, the beam pipe ﬂares out to a diameter

of d = 12.5 cm. While close in value, waves with λ < d should still propagate with small

absorption, of the same order as the one given for the ILC. The absorption is expected to

peak sharply at λ = 2d = 5 cm, due to the small piece of narrow beam pipe near the IP. It

is a fact that can probably be tested experimentally if CB is studied at CESR. Clearly, in

the CESR case the microwave propagation is in waveguide mode.

Finally, one builds the EM waves in the case of beamstrahlung to show how they can

be coherent. First consider the situation where the beams overlap completely (a perfect

together with the force vector components due to the attraction towards the center of the

other beam. Their components cancel one another, except for statistical ﬂuctuations. The

radiation is incoherent.

In Fig. 5b the beams are oﬀset, the x

components still cancel and are incoherent, but

components add up. Therefore, CB is present only in the case of a beam-beam oﬀset

and completely polarized in the transverse direction of oﬀset. In practice, the ILC beams

are so ﬂat that only the y

oﬀset matters (see Table I below).

III. SIMULATIONS AND RESULTS.

In a typical beam-beam simulation, each beam is divided in many cells, and the BBC

is simulated by stepping one beam through the other, one layer of cells at a time. The

EM ﬁelds, in the ultrarelativistic approximation, are purely transverse so that only layers of

beam 1 and beam 2 overlapping along the z-axis (the direction of motion) interact with one

another. Also the ultrarelativistic limit implies that the force on a given electron in beam 1

Throughout this Section either the force vector or the electric ﬁeld vector are used inter-

changeably, since they diﬀer by a multiplicative constant. The ﬁeld exerted by beam 2 on

the cell i in beam 1 is computed as a sum of the ﬁelds of all the cells j of beam 2 overlapping

along the beam axis

Ei1 = X Eij(bij),

with bij the transverse impact parameter between the centers of the two cells.

The ﬁeld determines the deﬂection of the beam 1 cell for this step of the BBC, and

therefore the trajectory of each cell during collision (which ultimately causes the disruption

phenomenon). Dynamic quantities are now given. After some algebra, one ﬁnds

step. Fi1 is the force exerted on one particle of beam 1 by the whole beam 2 layer interacting

with it. The p are the fractional charge population in each cell. All beamstrahlung simulation

codes feature Eqs. 2-3, because they describe the way the beams disrupt one another.

When it comes to radiation, the simplest possible case is when the radiation energy loss

is very small compared to the beam energy. This is the limit valid for the SLC and also

for CESR today. Those cases are fairly simple to treat. Each cell’s energy does not change

through the interaction, and the radiated energy is proportional to the force squared. The

incoherent energy vector U(ω) is formed by the two polarization components of the energy

emitted at a particular frequency ω.

g is a small number describing the angular and frequency acceptance of the detector. U1

is relevant at large angle where the polarization can be 100% at certain angular locations[6].

The sum is then extended to all layers to obtain the total radiated energy for the collision.
Of note are the dependence of U1 on N1, due to incoherence, and N 2

2 , which comes through

the square dependence on the force. A quantity U0 is introduced, the energy radiated

incoherently when the beams collide perfectly.

If the disruption is not too large, U0 is

unpolarized, and polarization phenomena arise when the BBC is not perfect[6].

When one considers the ILC, the only change compared to CESR is that energy loss is

not small compared to the beam energy. This is taken care by more complex algorithms,

mainly by introducing also a set of macroparticles which are allowed to lose energy according

to the quantum ﬂuctuations. Speciﬁc simulations were done with this technique to verify

the consistency of the results below.

Finally, we get to address how to simulate CB. As stated before, the radiation is assumed

to propagate freely inside the beam pipe. The algorithm used in Ref.[6] is used to produce

the results of Figs. 6-8, but with a change. One now adds all electric ﬁeld vectors during

the BBC, then squares them at the end, to evaluate coherent eﬀects. Naming the CB power

and likewise for W2. As in Eqs. 4-5, the sum is run over all cells in all layers. k and

x are the momentum and space photon 4-vectors. The simulation were all done assuming

that the radiation propagates along the direction of motion (zero angle approximation). The

coherent enhancement C shown in Figs. 6-8 is deﬁned as C = W/U0.

The approximation will hold only under the condition that the beam-beam deﬂection

angle and the beam angular spread be much smaller than the typical angular spread of the

radiation. The is probably adequate to compute the emitted power at CESR. It is almost

certainly not adequate for the ILC at full luminosity, where the deﬂection is going to be

large. If the angular divergence of the beam, including beam-beam eﬀects, is typically θdiv,

and the angular spread of the radiation θrad, one may reasonably expect that the coherent
enhancement will remain but be reduced by a quantity of order (θrad/θdiv)2.

The algorithm’s estimates of Wx, incoherent by construction, ﬂuctuate from zero to about
10−8 of the maximum Wy. The ﬂuctuations are due to computer roundup errors. This is

irrelevant at this time, given that Wx is negligible fraction of the power output when a

coherent enhancement is present (See Figs. 6-8 below). The calculation of Wy was also

observed to be unstable for very small oﬀsets. Empirically, the program was tested by

running it with slightly diﬀerent beam-beam oﬀsets of, e.g., 0.499, 0.5, and 0.501σy, making

sure that the results lay along a smooth curve. The program was found to be numerically

stable to 1% or better when the enhancement C exceeded the number of cells in a beam

(typically 30

30

40). In practice, the program does not work properly for oﬀsets which

are non zero but below 0.05σy.

Table I shows the beam parameters at startup and at nominal conditions. The main

simulation results are shown in Figs. 6-8 for startup (“weak”) beams.

In Fig. 6, the

microwave power (in units of IB power) is shown for equal colliding aussian beams as a

function of the beam-beam vertical oﬀset (in beam width units). The curves show the

dependence of the coherent yield for various λ/σz ratios. To give an idea of the eﬀect of

energy loss (ignored in the simulations), the point with a normalized oﬀset of 3.02 (the point
109 without energy loss and for λ/σz = 2.

Fig. 7 shows the side-to-side power ratio, when beams have diﬀering lengths (σz2/σz1) =

0.8. The ordinate in this plot is the ratio of the powers emitted by the beams. The shorter

beam will attain coherence at a lower wavelength than the other one, resulting in substan-

tially more power. From the ratio, and its dependence on wavelength, one measures accu-

rately the two beam lengths (with a precision which is probably dominated by uncertainties

in the wavelength being detected).

Fig. 8 shows the same plot as Fig. 6, for beams which have diﬀerent beam widths

(σy2/σy1 = 3). The slower turn-on of the coherence curve of the wider beam is noted.

Clearly CB measures two distinct degrees of freedom, which are, roughly speaking but not

exactly, the ratio of the beam-beam oﬀset and the vertical width of each beam.

IV. DETECTION OF COHERENT BEAMSTRAHLUNG AT THE ILC.

It has been already noted that CB has huge ﬂuctuations for relatively small changes in

oﬀset, and that the radiation of interest (between 0.3 and 1 mm wavelength) will travel

unimpeded inside the ILC beam pipe. It was also noted that the oﬀset is measured by the

CB power, that the beam length is measured as a ratio of powers at diﬀerent wavelengths,

and that the ratio of transverse widths is observed through the ratio W1/W2 (or alternatively

C1/C2) .

project.

It was also noted, in Fig. 6, that one will be able to measure sub-nanometer jitter at the

ILC, even when the beams are tens of nanometers wide. CB jumps by orders of magnitudes

for relatively small changes of oﬀset. Assuming a 5% measurement of W , and initial beams

of 20-40 nanometers, one can see that CB will be sensitive to jitter below 0.1-0.2 nm. Thus

diagnostic (and remediation) of some of the most worrisome instabilities of the ILC can start

long before the beams are made small, possibly improving the eﬃciency of the whole ILC

14

In this Section the problem of detection is addressed, but also some ideas are given on how

to handle the potentially large power of CB. The microwave radiation under consideration

has a typical angular spread of 0.1 mrad with respect to the electron instantaneous direction

(estimated using the large angle synchrotron radiation formulae of Ref.[7]). The angular

spread does not depend on whether the radiation is coherent or incoherent, as long as the

observation angle is such that θ << σz/λ, which is clearly the case here. 0.1 mrad is less

than the angular spread due to the typical beam-beam deﬂection, which is 2-3 mrad at

nominal conditions. The microwave beamstrahlung image at 100 meters will be of order

8-12 cm (assuming a 95% contour of the image) and forming a pixel image is an interesting

possibility, and possibly the topic of a future paper.

In Table II the expected yields for coherent beamstrahlung at the ILC are listed. They
are very large of course, because the beam populations are of order 1010. The maximum

with about 1MW in incoherent beamstrahlung.

A possible concern is that coherent beamstrahlung will blind a lot of equipment down-

stream whenever one of the beams jumps by a few σy. This concern has been partially

addressed in Section III in regard to the part of the spectrum that propagates in waveguide

mode, but also the free radiation (which is on time with the beam) needs to be addressed.

It is suggested here that the beam dump window be as reﬂective as possible and tilted so

as to bounce the microwave burst to another beam dump, leaving only the CB detector in

harm way (Fig. 9 below). The need for the window to be a very good mirror is stressed

here, because all microwave power will be deposited very close to the surface. Mechanical

resonances of the window, that may have a period which is a multiple of the bunch-bunch

period, are probably not a problem. The maximum impulse on the window(derived from
Table II) is a modest 4X10−8Nsec for a single bunch crossing.

The backgrounds from the machine magnets can be estimated.

In the low frequency

limit, one can use classical synchrotron radiation formulae which are accurate up to the

beamstrahlung fraction energy loss. The total incoherent energy U in a given low photon

which provides a simple way to compare the intensities of two diﬀerent SR. The B of an
ILC beam is of order 105 Tesla, and its length is 2σz. For the backgrounds one assumes

approximately 100 meters of magnets with an average B

3T.

By comparing the two estimates according to Eq. 8, for incoherent beamstrahlung signal

and magnets background, one sees that the incoherent beamstrahlung radiation will be

approximately 5% of the magnets background. An oﬀset of 0.1σy should be suﬃcient to take

the CB well above background. The machine background, as estimated here, is probably

too low to be detected by the device sketched below.

Given the large power and relatively small angular distribution a detection device is not

diﬃcult to design. The apparent challenges are how to safely extract the microwave beam

out of the powerful beamstrahlung spray, and how to accomodate the huge dynamic range

exhibited in Fig. 6. The results of Figs 6-8 suggest three or more diﬀerent bands. These

are assumed to be centered at 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 millimeters (each band having a 0.7% width,

17

see below). Strictly speaking this part of the spectrum is still in the far infrared, however,

detection techniques similar to the microwave region apply.

FIG. 9: Basic CB detection: a) reﬂection oﬀ of slightly tilted beam dump window; b) extraction

by a primary mirror at 15 meters; c) angular spreading by a microwave grating; d) detection by

three microwave diode arrays.

Given the presence of many machine components vying for space, and RF noise from

the nearby beam, one wishes to build this device as far away as possible from the beam

line. We consider the beam dump window, which will function as the primary mirror, to

be tilted by one degree (17 mrad) from its optimal orientation (Fig. 9). This arrangement

increases the amount of radiation and heat deposited in the window by beamstrahlung by

approximately 0.03%. This may look like one more aggravation for beam dump designers.

Very possibly there is no choice except to do build the window at an angle, because such a

strong microwave beam should simply not be reﬂected back into the ILC.

The window reﬂected microwave beam (and all other wavelengths all the way to near

UV) is collected about 15 meters in front of the beam dump, approximately 26 cm from the

beamline. Fig. 9 shows a primary mirror that bounces the radiation away from the beam

line. The window and the primary mirror need not be polished, in fact the typical roughness

of beam pipe metal (typically a few microns) would be useful to disperse unwanted shorter

18

wavelengths. At the same time these ”mirrors” would reﬂect microwaves perfectly, being at

least λ/20 smooth.

30
The third mirror is in fact a grating. Such a device (assumed to have an area of 30
cm2) can be easily manufactured out of 143 razor blades spaced by D = 2.1mm. The

×

interest of using razor blades is that their edge will be well above (perhaps one inch) the

blades support. Radiation whose λ << D will not scatter and be absorbed in the non-

reﬂective background behind the blades (which will act as another beam dump and be also

water cooled). The radiation whose λ >> D which was not absorbed by the grid can not

have secondary maxima, will see the grating as a good mirror, and reﬂect the rest of the

radiation to the ﬁnal microwave beam dump.

This grating eﬀectively acts like a broadband ﬁlter, leaving only the band of interest

being reﬂected at an angle by the grating. The grating will have a wavelength resolution of

order 1/143, or 0.7%. This number will reﬂect into a measurement of σz which should be of

the same order.

Radiation in each of the three bands is then collected at their ﬁrst order maximum

(respectively at 12, 25 and 40 degrees with respect to the main reﬂected microwave beam)

by three microwave detector arrays. These are in danger of failure due to the spikes in

microwave radiation they may receive. However, one notices that the arrangement allows a

power reduction of close to three orders of magnitude compared to the entire signal.

A microwave ﬁlter (water cooled) is located in front of the second and third array to

prevent, for example, the second order maximum of 0.45mm radiation from introducing a

spurious signal in the 0.9mm detector.

The choice of detector is restricted to two candidates. One candidate is the traditional

tunnel diode, as sold by Eclipse[18]. This diode is far superior, for this application, to the

most common microwave Schottky diode. First, it is much faster, 10nsec typical rise time

against a few hundred nsec. Second, it has a very large dynamic range, about 40dB from

noise to maximum output. Third, the V-I curve ﬂattens at high voltages, eﬀectively limiting

the power in the diode and helping minimize diode failure. The nominal sensitivity of these

diodes is around 1V/mW.

The second candidate consists of heterodyne detectors[19]. These have been developed

relatively more recently and can resolve picosecond signals. It is unclear whether they can

provide the dynamic range that is required here, however, being more sensitive than tunnel

19

diodes, they could eventually be part of the detection device. In the following we assume a

tunnel diode system, based on their desirable V-I curve, large dynamic range, and reasonably

fast rise-time.

Ideally one could have two diodes, side by side, covering the same solid angle but masked

by attenuators of diﬀerent strength (given the numbers of Table II, 20dB and 50dB). The

strongest attenuators are really needed only for the longest wavelengths, as Fig. 6 shows,

because shorter wavelengths span a more modest dynamic range. Most probably, it will be

desirable to extract the microwave beam outside the vacuum (diamond, quartz or amorphous

silicon are transparent in this band) so as to replace failing diodes easily.

In each array, all diodes will be connected to the same power supply, and control of the

biasing voltage can give close to two orders of magnitude control of the output current. In

practice the diodes voltage will be decreased as the ILC ramps up. All diodes are properly

gated and connected to their own fast ADC. From there the data enter the ILC data stream.
This simple arrangement would eﬀectively provide a dynamic range of 108, which should

easily cover the expected signal from 0.2σ oﬀsets at startup to the maximum expected signal

at nominal conditions.

The diodes are also quite small (millimeters in size). The size of each microwave detector,

in fact, is determined by the size of the attenuator or ﬁlter (which typically has the diameter

of a BNC connector), so that several detectors should be able to ﬁt within the same device.

This is a most basic design for the device, but one that should provide the information

promised by Figs. 6-8. Future detector development could include the polarization splitting

of the microwave signal (the x

component would give the oﬀset in x), and the projection of

−

the microwave image onto a matrix of diodes for the purpose of imaging the BBC. Adoption

of logarithmic electronics should simplify the dynamic range problem. The option of de-

veloping a fast, low sensitivity (perhaps 1µV/W) device with a V

I curve asymptotically

−

going to zero would also assure that the detectors would not fail during protracted data

taking.

V. CONCLUSIONS.

It appears that coherent beamstrahlung has a role to play at the ILC, its observables

being somewhat diﬀerent from more established beam-beam monitoring methods. While

20

CB manifests itself only when the beams are oﬀset, beam jitter should provide enough

collisions, where the signal is usable, to continuously monitor the beams.

The strength of the method include large, background-free signals, which allow measure-

ments of the BBC as soon as the ILC turns on, direct measurements of the beam-beam

oﬀset, probably to an incredible precision well below 1nm, their respective beam lengths ,

probably to 1% or better precision, and the ratio of their transverse widths.

There is much left to do about coherent beamstrahlung. The exact coherent enhancement

in the presence of a large angular divergence, its exact transmission mode down the beam

pipe, the possibility of imaging the BBC through coherent beamstrahlung, all have to be

assessed.

Abstract

KEK-ATF is studying the low-emittance multi-bunch elec-
tron beam for the future linear collider. In ATF, thermionic
gun is used to generate 20 bunches electron beam with the
bunch spacing of 2.8 ns. Due to a distortion of the gun
emission and the beam loading effect in the bunching sys-
tem, the intensity for each bunch is not uniform by up to
40 % at the end of the injector. We have developed a sys-
tem to correct the gun emission by precisely controlling the
cathode voltage with a function generator. For the beam
loading effect, we have introduced RF amplitude modula-
tion on Sub Harmonic Buncher, SHB. By these technique,
bunch intensity uniformity was improved and beam trans-
mission for later bunches was recovered from 67% to 91%,
but intensity for ﬁrst ﬁve bunches is still lower than others.

2 MULTI-BUNCH BEAM GENERATION
The gun assembly consists from a thermionic gun, Grid
pulser, and a high voltage gun pulser.

The thermionic gun, is a triode type, EIMAC Y796. The

electron current is controlled by Grid bias.

To make a multi-bunch electron beam with a bunch spac-
ing of 2.8 ns, 357 MHz RF signal is applied to the GUN
cathode. 357MHz ECL level RF signal is ampliﬁed by a
power ampliﬁer. This output has a pulse height of 400 V
peak-to-peak, but the amplitude is gradually changing at
the rise and fall edge as shown in FIG. 1.

INTRODUCTION

KEK-ATF is a test facility to develop the low emittance
multi-bunch beam and beam instrumentation technique for
the future linear collider. That consists from 1.5 GeV S-
band linac, a beam transport line, a damping ring, and a
diagnostic extraction line.

In the linac,

the electron beam is generated by a
thermionic electron gun. Typical intensity is 1.0 × 1010
electron/bunch. The bunch length is compressed from 1
ns to 10 ps by passing a couple of sub-harmonic bunchers,
a TW buncher, and the ﬁrst S-band accelerating structure.
This area is called as injector part. After the injector part,
electron energy becomes 80 MeV.

The electron beam is then accelerated up to 1.3 GeV by 8
of the S-band regular accelerating section. One section has
two accelerating structures driven by a klystron-modulator.
Klystron is Toshiba E3712 generating 80 MW with a pulse
duration of 4.5µs RF. A peak power of 400 MW with a
pulse duration of 1.0µs is obtained by SLED cavity and
makes a high gradient accelerating ﬁeld, 30 MeV/m.

20 of bunches separated by 2.8 ns are accelerated by one
RF pulse. This multi-bunch method is one of the key tech-
nique in the linear collider.

In April 2000, we achieved horizontal emittance 1.3 ×
10−9rad.m, vertical emittance1.7 × 10−11rad.m (both for
2.0 × 109electron/bunch, single bunch mode )[1] which
are almost our target.

In November 2000, we have started the multi-bunch op-
eration. The commissioning was successfully done. Due
to lack of the instrumentation device for the multi-bunch
diagnostic, emittance for each bunch is not measured yet.

Grid bias

Rectangular signal

Figure 1: To omit the rise and fall edge of 357 MHz RF
signal, a rectangular signal is combined. Grid bias is deter-
mined to clip uniform multi-bunch beam.

If the RF signal is directly applied to Gun cathode, bunch
intensity becomes not ﬂat. To get uniform bunches, an ad-
ditional rectangular pulse is combined as shown in FIG 1.
The grid bias is determined that the rectangular pulse clips
out the ﬂat part of the RF signal. Finally, only the ﬂat part
of the RF pulse is obtained as real beam current.

3 EMISSION CORRECTION
FIG. 2 shows the multi-bunch beam generated by
thermionic gun. The vertical and horizontal axes show time
in ns and the beam current in A respectively. The grid bias
was set to 240 V. The left side is early bunch. The beam
current is measured by a current transformer which is set
right after the gun exit. The current transformer measures
the beam current as the induction voltage, so the output de-
cays with a time constant.

Intensity for the ﬁrst three bunches is still increasing.
This behavior is due to the rounded rising edge of the clip-
ping rectangular pulse.

In addition, several bunches around 13th and 14th have
lower intensity than others. A study for the gun emission
[2] demonstrated that the gun response to the rectangular

derstood. This is not any problem on the electrical circuit
such as reﬂection signal because any dip was not observed
in direct measurement of the rectangular pulse applied to
the cathode.

Figure 3: Multi-bunch beam applying the correction signal.
Grid bias was 240 V.

To correct this dip, an additional signal source was in-
troduced. The correction signal is produced by a function
generator, Tektronix AWG 510 which can make an arbi-
trary waveform with 1 GHz clock speed. The signal is
transfered to the gun high voltage station through an op-
tical cable , ampliﬁed 20 W RF ampliﬁer, and combined
with the main signal through a resistive power combiner.
Typical amplitude of the correction signal is 30 V which is
roughly 10% of the main signal applied to the gun cathode.
FIG. 3 shows the gun output by applying the correc-
tion signal. The grid bias was set to 240 V. The ﬁrst three
bunches have still current lower than others, but the large
dip on 12-15th bunches in FIG. 2 was well compensated.

4 SHB AMPLITUDE MODULATION
Electron beam generated by the thermionic gun has approx-
imately 1 ns bunch length which is larger than acceptance
of S-band acceleration. A couple of 357 MHz standing
wave Sub-harmonic bunchers, and a traveling wave S-band
buncher are placed to gather electrons into the S-band ac-
ceptance, 10 − 20ps.

In multi-bunch operation, the bunching ﬁeld is decreased
by beam induced ﬁeld,
i.e. wake ﬁeld. This is the
beam loading effect. Beam loading effect is larger for
later bunch, so the condition becomes worse for the later
bunches.

Figure 4:
In amplitude modulation method, amplitude of
input RF is changed synchronously with the beam timing.
Cavity RF amplitude is then gradually increased with the
ﬁlling time as shown by the dashed line. On the other hand,
RF amplitude is decreased by the beam loading effect as
shown by the dotted line. Totally, cavity RF amplitude is
kept ﬂat.

To compensate the beam loading effect, we have in-
troduced amplitude modulation on pulsed RF for SHBs.
In amplitude modulation, the amplitude of pulsed RF is
changed synchronously with the beam timing. FIG. 4
shows the beam loading compensation by amplitude mod-
ulation schematically. Cavity RF amplitude is then gradu-
ally increased with ﬁlling time as shown by the dashed line.
On the other hand, RF amplitude is decreased by the beam
loading effect as shown by the dotted line. Totally, cavity
RF amplitude is kept ﬂat. The bunching quality becomes
equal for all bunches.

The beam loading effect always decelerates the followed
bunches. In ATF, the ﬁrst SHB, SHB1 is operated in de-
celeration mode and the second, SHB2 is in acceleration
mode. The beam loading effectively increases RF ampli-
tude in SHB1 and decreases in SHB2 . Modulation sign is
then negative for SHB1 and positive for SHB2.

Optimization for the amplitude modulation has been
done by looking beam transmission at the end of injector
part. A wall current monitor is placed at the exit of the
injector part to observe the beam current. FIG. 5 shows
the response of the wall current monitor to the multi-bunch
beam. The dotted and solid curves indicate those obtained
with the conventional pulsed RF and the amplitudely mod-
ulated pulsed RF on SHBs respectively. Transmission for

2.8 ns. The beam already reached to the extraction line,
but the emittance was not measured yet due to lack of the
instrumentation for multi-bunch beam.

Intensity for each bunch is not uniform because of ; 1)

gun emission un-uniformity; 2) beam loading effect.

For gun emission problem, we have applied a correc-
tion signal generated by an arbitrary function generator to
Gun cathode. Bunch intensity ﬂatness was signiﬁcantly im-
proved by this emission correction. However, Gun emis-
sion for ﬁrst ﬁve bunches is still lower than others. That
will be one of the main issue in future.

For beam loading effect, we have introduced amplitude
modulation on SHB RF. The amplitude modulation com-
pensated the beam loading effect and recovered the beam
transmission from 67% to 91%.

the later bunches was recovered by the amplitude modula-
tion.

The beam loading effect affects the transmission for the
later bunches, then we should investigate the bunch trans-
mission to examine the beam loading effect. Since the ab-
solute transmission for each bunch is hard to measure ex-
actly, the intensity ratio of the early bunch and later bunch
can be used instead of the absolute transmission.

Intensity of the last bunch is much lower than others due
to the less sharpness of the clipping rectangular pulse. Be-
cause of that, effect of the amplitude modulation should
be examined by the last second bunch rather than the last
bunch.

The transmission ratio of the second last bunch was 0.67
for the conventional SHB RF and 0.91 for the amplitudely
modulated SHB RF respectively. The most intense bunch
was used as the reference. Improvement of the transmis-
sion by the amplitude modulation was 24%.

FIG. 6 shows distributions of bunch intensity for 6th and
later bunches. The peak voltage of wall current monitor
is here used instead of the real beam current. The solid
and hatched histograms are those with the amplitude mod-
ulation and the conventional pulsed RF on SHB respec-
tively. With the amplitude modulation, most bunches are
distributed more than 18 V, but with the conventional RF,
bunches are spread widely from 12 V to 20 V. The ampli-
tude modulation improved the ﬂatness of intensity for these
later bunches.

FIG. 6 does not include the ﬁrst ﬁve bunches. The lower
intensity of these bunches is due to the rounded rising edge
of the clipping pulse. That will be one of the main issue on
the multi-bunch operation.

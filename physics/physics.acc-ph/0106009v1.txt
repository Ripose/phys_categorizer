Abstract

The consideration of transverse dynamics of relativis-
tic space-charge dominated beams and halo growth due to
bunch oscillations is based on variational approach to ratio-
nal (in dynamical variables) approximation for rms enve-
lope equations. It allows to control contribution from each
scale of underlying multiscales and represent solutions via
exact nonlinear eigenmodes expansions. Our approach is
based on methods provided possibility to work with well-
localized bases in phase space and good convergence prop-
erties of the corresponding expansions.

INTRODUCTION

In this paper we consider the applications of a new nu-
merical-analytical technique based on the methods of local
nonlinear harmonic analysis or wavelet analysis to nonlin-
ear rms envelope dynamics problems which can be char-
acterized by collective type behaviour [1], [2]. Such ap-
proach may be useful in all models in which it is possible
and reasonable to reduce all complicated problems related
with statistical distributions to the problems described by
systems of nonlinear ordinary/partial differential equations
with or without some (functional) constraints. Wavelet
analysis is a set of mathematical methods, which gives the
possibility to work with well-localized bases in functional
spaces and gives the maximum sparse forms for the general
type of operators (differential, integral, pseudodifferential)
in such bases. Our approach is based on the variational-
wavelet approach from [3]-[14], that allows to consider ra-
tional type of nonlinearities in rms dynamical equations.
The solution has the multiscale/multiresolution decompo-
sition via nonlinear high-localized eigenmodes, which cor-
responds to the full multiresolution expansion in all under-
lying time/space scales. We may move from coarse scales
of resolution to the ﬁnest one for obtaining more detailed
information about our dynamical process. In this way we
give contribution to our full solution from each scale of
resolution or each time/space scale or from each nonlin-
ear eigenmode. The same is correct for the contribution
to power spectral density (energy spectrum): we can take
into account contributions from each level/scale of reso-
lution. Starting in part 2 from general rms envelope dy-
namics model we consider in part 3 the approach based on
variational-wavelet formulation. We give explicit represen-
tation for all dynamical variables in the base of compactly
supported wavelets or nonlinear eigenmodes. Our solutions
are parametrized by the solutions of a number of reduced

algebraical problems one from which is nonlinear with the
same degree of nonlinearity and the others are the linear
problems depend on particular wavelet type approach. In
part 4 we consider numerical modelling based on our ana-
lytical approach.

2 RMS EQUATIONS

We consider an approach based on the second moments
of the distribution functions for the calculation of evolution
of rms envelope of a beam. The rms envelope equations are
the most useful for analysis of the beam self–forces (space–
charge) effects and also allow to consider both transverse
and longitudinal dynamics of space-charge-dominated rel-
ativistic high–brightness axisymmetric/asymmetric beams,
which under short laser pulse–driven radio-frequency pho-
toinjectors have fast transition from nonrelativistic to rela-
tivistic regime [1]. The analysis of halo growth in beams,
appeared as result of bunch oscillations in the particle-core
model, is also based on three-dimensional envelope equa-
tions [1], [2]. Let f (xi) be the distribution function, which
gives full information about noninteracting ensemble of
beam particles regarding to trace space or transverse phase
coordinates (xi, xj). Then we may extract the ﬁrst nontriv-
ial effects of collective dynamics from the second moments

RMS emittances are given by

We consider the following most general case of rms enve-
lope equations, which describe evolution of the moments
in the model of halo formation by bunch oscillations (ref.
[2] for full designation):

¨σx + k2

where σx(s), σy(s), σz(s) are bunch envelopes, ξx, ξy,
ξz = F (σx, σy, σz). After transformations to Cauchy form
we can see that all these equations from the formal point of
view are not more than ordinary differential equations with
rational nonlinearities and variable coefﬁcients. Also, we
consider regimes in which we are interested in constraints
on emittances:

ε2
xi,rms = ci,

(4)

where ci are constants.
In the same way according to
[2] we may consider the case of energy-type functional-
differential constraints on emittances. A different approach
is considered in our related paper in this Proceedings [15].

3 RATIONAL DYNAMICS WITH

CONSTRAINTS

Our problems above may be formulated as the systems

of ordinary differential equations

possible time dependence) of LHS of initial system of dif-
ferential equations (5) and as consequence are coefﬁcients
of RSAE. Pij are the coefﬁcients (with possible time de-
pendence) of RHS of initial system of differential equa-
tions (5) and as consequence are the coefﬁcients of RSAE.
I = (i1, ..., iq+2), J = (j1, ..., jp+1) are multiindexes,
by which are labelled αI and βI , the other coefﬁcients of
RSAE (9):

βJ = {βj1...jp+1} =

ψjk ,

x = (x1, ..., xn),

(5)

where p is the degree of polynomial operator P (5)

with initial (or boundary) conditions xi(0), xi(T ) and
Pi, Qi are not more than polynomial functions of dy-
namical variables xj and have arbitrary dependence on
time/length parameter. Of course, we consider such Qi(x)
which do not lead to the singular problem with Qi(x),
when t = 0 or t = T , i.e. Qi(x(0)), Qi(x(T )) 6= ∞,
0. We’ll consider these equations as the following oper-
ator equation. Let L be an arbitrary nonlinear (rational)
matrix differential operator of the ﬁrst order with matrix
dimension d (d=6 in our case) corresponding to the sys-
tem of equations (5), which acts on some set of functions
t ∈ Ω ⊂ R from
Ψ ≡ Ψ(t) =
L2(Ω):

Ψ1(t), . . . , Ψd(t)
(cid:17)
(cid:16)

,

LΨ ≡ L(R, t)Ψ(t) = 0,

(6)

where R ≡ R(t, ∂/∂t, Ψ).

Let us consider now the N mode approximation for so-
lution as the following ansatz (in the same way we may
consider different ansatzes):

ΨN (t) =

aN
r ψr(t)

N

Xr=1

(7)

(8)

We shall determine the coefﬁcients of expansion from the
following variational conditions (different related varia-
tional approaches are considered in [3]-[14]):

LN

k ≡

Z

(LΨN )ψk(t)dt = 0

We have exactly dN algebraical equations for dN un-
knowns ar. So, variational approach reduced the initial
problem (5) or (6) to the problem of solution of functional
equations at the ﬁrst stage and some algebraical problems
at the second stage. Here ψk(t) are useful basis functions of
some functional space (L2, Lp, Sobolev, etc) correspond-
ing to concrete problem. As result we have the following
reduced algebraical system of equations (RSAE) on the set
of unknown coefﬁcients aN

i of expansions (7):

L(Qij, aN

i , αI ) = M (Pij , aN

i , βJ ),

(9)

where operators L and M are algebraization of RHS and
LHS of initial problem (5). Qij are the coefﬁcients (with

αI = {αi1...αiq+2 } =

ψi1 ... ˙ψis ...ψiq+2 ,

Xi1,...,iq+2

Z

(11)
where q is the degree of polynomial operator Q (5), iℓ =
(1, ..., q + 2),

˙ψis = dψis /dt.

According to [3]-[14] we may extend our approach to
the case when we have additional constraints (4) on the set
of our dynamical variables Ψ or x. In this case by using
the method of Lagrangian multipliers we again may apply
the same approach but for the extended set of variables. As
result we receive the expanded system of algebraical equa-
tions analogous to the system (9). Then, after reduction we
again can extract from its solution the coefﬁcients of ex-
pansion (7). Now, when we solve RSAE (9) and determine
unknown coefﬁcients from formal expansion (7) we there-
fore obtain the solution of our initial problem. It should
be noted if we consider only truncated expansion (7) with
N terms then we have from (9) the system of N × d al-
gebraical equations with degree ℓ = max{p, q} and the
degree of this algebraical system coincides with degree of
initial differential system. So, we have the solution of the
initial nonlinear (rational) problem in the form

x(t) = x(0) +

aN
k ψk(t),

(12)

N

Xk=1

where coefﬁcients aN
k are roots of the corresponding re-
duced algebraical (polynomial) problem RSAE (9). Con-
sequently, we have a parametrization of solution of initial
problem by solution of reduced algebraical problem (9).

The problem of computations of coefﬁcients αI (11), βJ
(10) of reduced algebraical system may be explicitly solved
in wavelet approach. The obtained solutions are given in
the form (12), where ψk(t) are wavelet basis functions. In
our case ψk(t) are obtained via multiresolution expansions
and represented by compactly supported wavelets. Because
afﬁne group of translation and dilations is inside the ap-
proach, this method resembles the action of a microscope.
We have contribution to ﬁnal result from each scale of res-
olution from the whole inﬁnite scale of spaces:

...V−2 ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ ...,
where the closed subspace Vj(j ∈ Z) corresponds to level
j of resolution, or to scale j. This multiresolution functional

space decomposition corresponds to exact nonlinear eigen-
mode decompositions (12).

It should be noted that such representations give the
best possible localization properties in the corresponding
(phase)space/time coordinates.
In contrast with differ-
ent approaches formulae (7), (12) do not use perturba-
tion technique or linearization procedures and represent
dynamics via generalized nonlinear localized eigenmodes
expansion. So, by using wavelet bases with their good
(phase)space/time localization properties we can construct
high-localized (coherent) structures in spatially-extended
stochastic systems with collective behaviour.

4 MODELLING

So, our N mode construction (7), (12) gives the follow-

ing representation for solution of rms equations (3):

x(t) = xslow

N (t) +

xi(ωit), ωi ∼ 2i

(13)

Xi≥N

where xr(s) may be represented by some family of (non-
linear) eigenmodes and gives as a result the multiresolu-
tion/multiscale representation in the high-localized wavelet
bases. The corresponding decomposition is presented on
Fig. 1 and two-dimensional transverse section σx–σy on
Fig. 2.

Abstract
Quadrupole scans were used to characterize the LEDA RFQ
beam. Experimental data were ﬁt to computer simulation
models for the rms beam size. The codes were found to
be inadequate in accurately reproducing details of the wire
scanner data. When this discrepancy is resolved, we plan
to ﬁt using all the data in wire scanner proﬁles, not just the
rms values, using a 3-D nonlinear code.

1

INTRODUCTION

During commissioning of the LEDA RFQ[1, 2], we found
that the beam behaved in the high energy beam transport
(HEBT) much as predicted. Thus the actual RFQ beam must
have been close to that computed by the PARMTEQM code.
The HEBT included only limited diagnostics[3] but we
were able to get additional information on the RFQ beam
distribution using quadrupole scans[4]. An good under-
standing of the RFQ beam and beam behavior in the HEBT
will be helpful for the upcoming beam halo experiment.
The problems with the quad scan measurements were the
strong space effects and the almost complete lack of knowl-
edge of the longitudinal phase space. Also, our simulation
codes, which served as the models for the data ﬁtting, did
not accurately reproduce the measured beam proﬁles at the
wire scanner.

2 HEBT DESIGN

The HEBT[5] transports the RFQ beam to the beamstop and
provides space for beam diagnostics. Here, we discuss
HEBT properties relevant to beam characterization.

• Design has Weak Focusing. Ideally, the HEBT would
have closely-space quadrupoles at the upstream end
until the beam is signiﬁcantly debunched, i.e., for
about one meter. After this point, we could use any
kind of matching scheme with no fear of spoiling the
beam distribution with space-charge nonlinearities.
Our HEBT design uses four quadrupoles, which is
the minimum that provides adequate focusing for the
given length. Any fewer than four quadrupoles re-
sults in the generation of long Gaussian-like tails in
the beam, which would be scraped off in the HEBT.

• Good Tune is Important. If a tune has a small waist
in the upstream part of the HEBT, the beam will also
acquire Gaussian-like tails. Simulations showed that

good tunes existed for our four-quadrupole beamline
and were stable (slight changes in magnet settings or
input beam did not lead to beam degradation).

• Beam Size Control.

In our design, increasing the
strength of the last quadrupole (Q4) increases the
beam size in both x and y by about the same amount.
This is because there is a crossover in x just down-
stream of Q4 and a (virtual) crossover just upstream
of Q4 in y. If the beam turns out to not be circular,
this can be adjusted by Q3, which moves the upstream
crossover point.

• Emittance Growth in HEBT. Simulations showed that
the transverse emittances grew by about 30% in the
HEBT. However, this did not affect ﬁnal beam size. At
the downstream end of the HEBT and in the beamstop,
the beam is in the zero-emittance regime (very nar-
row phase-space ellipses). Simulations with TRACE
3-D, which has no nonlinear effects, and a 3-D par-
ticle code that included nonlinear space-charge pre-
dicted almost identical ﬁnal beam sizes.

3 OBSERVED HEBT PERFORMANCE

Near the beamstop entrance, there is a collimator with a
size less than 3 times the rms beam size. Initial runs showed
beam hitting the top and bottom of the the collimator, in-
dicating the beam was too large in y. This was ﬁxed by
readjusting Q3 and slightly reducing Q4 to reduce the beam
size. After these adjustments, beam losses were negligible.
This indicated the HEBT was operating as predicted and the
RFQ beam was about as predicted. There were no long tails
generated in the HEBT that were being scraped off. Thus
our somewhat risky design, having only four quadrupoles,
worked as designed.

4 QUADRUPOLE SCANS

4.1 Procedure

Only the ﬁrst two quadrupoles were used. For character-
izing the beam in y, Q1, which focuses in y, was varied
and the beam was observed at the wire scanner, which was
about 2.5 m downstream. The value of the Q2 gradient was
chosen so that the beam was contained in the x direction
for all values of Q1. For characterizing x, Q2 was varied.
As the quadrupole strength is increased, the beam size
at the wire scanner goes through a minimum. At the min-
imum, there is a waist at approximately the wire-scanner
position. For larger quadrupole strengths, the waist moves

upstream in the beamline.

4.2 Measurements
Quadrupole scans were done a number of times for a vari-
ety of beam currents for both the x and y directions. The
minimum beam size at the wire scanner was near 2 mm,
which was almost equal to the size of the steering jitter.
Approximately ten quadrupole settings were used for each
scan. Data were recorded and analyzed off line.

4.3 Fitting to Data
To determine the phase-space properties of the beam at the
exit of the RFQ, we needed a model that could predict the
beam proﬁle at the wire scanner, given the beam at the RFQ
exit. We parameterized the RFQ beam with the Courant-
Snyder parameters α, β, and ǫ in the three directions. We
used the simulation codes TRACE 3-D and LINAC as models
for computing rms beam sizes in our ﬁtting. The TRACE
3-D code is a sigma-matrix (second moments) code that
includes only linear effects but is 3-D. The LINAC code is
a particle in cell (PIC) code that has a nonlinear r-z space
charge algorithm.

Figure 1 shows the rms beam size in the y direction as
a function of Q1 gradient. The experimental numbers are
averages from a set of quad scan runs[4]. The other curves
are simulations using the TRACE 3-D, LINAC, and IMPACT
codes. The IMPACT code is a 3-D PIC code with nonlinear
space charge. The initial beam (at the RFQ exit) for all
simulations is the beam determined by the ﬁt to the LINAC
model[4]. (This is why there is little difference between the
experimental points and the LINAC simulation.) There are
signiﬁcant differences among the codes in the predictions
of the the rms beam size. Table 1 shows emittances we

5 QUAD SCAN SIMULATIONS

5.1 Proﬁles at Wire Scanner
Since only the IMPACT code has nonlinear 3-D space
charge, we would expect that this code would be the most
accurate and should be used to ﬁt to the data. Both nonlin-
ear and 3-D effects are large in the quad scans. However,
we found that the IMPACT code (as well as LINAC) could
not predict well the beam proﬁle at the wire scanner. Fig-
ure 2 shows the projections onto the y axis for two points
of the y quad scan, corresponding to a Q1 gradients of 7.52
and 11.0 T/m. The agreement for 11 T/m, which is to the
right of the minimum of the quad scan curve, is especially
poor. We see that the experimental curve (solid) has a nar-
rower peak, with more beam in the tail than the IMPACT
simulation predicts.

imental measurement and the dashed curve is the IMPACT

Figure 3 shows the y phase space just after Q2 for two
points in the y quad scan. After Q2, space charge has little
effect and the beam mostly just drifts to the end (there is
little change in the maximum value of |y ′|). The graph on
the left is for a Q1 value to the left of the quad scan mini-
mum (9.5 T/m). The graph at the right shows the situation
to the right of the minimum (10.9 T/m). The distribution
in the left graph is diverging, while the one on the right is
converging. It is this convergence that apparently leads to
the strange tails we seen in the experimental proﬁles at the
wire scanner. Figure 4 shows similar graphs a little before

how the tails in the y projection form for the case of the
quad scan points to the right of the minimum, which cor-
respond to larger quad gradients. While this appears to ex-
plain the narrow-peak-with-enhanced-tails seen in the wire
scans, the effect is much smaller than in the experiment.

wire scanner.

We studied various effects looking to better reproduce
the proﬁles seen at the wire scanner, all with negative re-
sults.

5.2 Code Physics

We studied the effects of mesh sizes, boundary conditions,
particle number, and time step sizes with no signiﬁcant
change in results.

We investigated the possibility that there were errors as-
sociated with using normalized variables (px) in a z code,
which IMPACT is. For high-eccentricity ellipses, this could
be problem. However, transforming distributions to unnor-
malized coordinates, which are appropriate to a z code, did
not noticeably change the results.

5.3 Effects of Input Beam

We used for input the beam generated by the RFQ simu-
lation code PARMTEQM. We also used generated beams,
which were speciﬁed by the Courant-Snyder parameters.
Using the Courant-Snyder parameters of the PARMTEQM
beam yielded similar results. Varying these parameters in
various ways did not make the beam look any closer to the
experimentally observed one.

We tried various distortions of the input beam such as
enhancing the core or tail and distorting the phase space
by giving each particle a kick in y ′ direction proportional
to y2 or y3. These changes had little effect, even for very
severe distortions. Kicks proportional to y1/3 were more
effective. These are more like space-charge effects in that
the distortion is larger near the origin and smaller near the
tails. In general, we found that any structure we put into
the input beam tended to disappear because of the strong
nonlinear space-charge forces at the HEBT front end.

5.4 Effects of Quad Errors

Multipole errors were investigate using a version of
MARYLIE with 3-D space charge. We could generate tails
that looked like the experimentally observed ones, but this
took multipoles that were about 500 times as large as were
measured when the quadrupoles were mapped.

Quadrupole rotation studies also yielded negative re-

sults.

Space Charge

5.5
We investigated various currents and variations in space
charge effects along the beamline, as could be generated
by neutralization or unknown effects.

5.6 Longitudinal Motion
We had practically no knowledge of the beam in the longi-
tudinal direction except that practically all of the beam is
very near the 6.7 MeV design energy. Since the transverse
beam seems to be reasonably predicted by the RFQ simu-
lation code, we do not expect the longitudinal phase space
to be much different from the prediction. We tried various
longitudinal phase-space variations and none led to proﬁles
at the wire scanner that looked similar to the experimental
ones.

6 DISCUSSION

In the upstream part of the HEBT the beam size proﬁles
(xrms and yrms as functions of z) for the quad scan tune are
not much different from those of the normal HEBT tune.
The differences occurs quite a way downstream. But here,
space charge effects are small and are unlikely to explain
the differences we see in the beam proﬁles at the wire scan-
ner. This is a mystery that is still unresolved.

If we succeed in simulating proﬁles at the wire scanners
that look more like the ones seen in the measurement, then
it will be reasonable to ﬁt the data to the 3-D IMPACT sim-
ulations. In that case, we will use all the wire-scanner data,
taking into account the detailed shape of the proﬁle and
not just the rms value of the beam width, as we did for the
TRACE 3-D and LINAC ﬁts. While we were able to use a
personal computer to run the HPF version of IMPACT for
most of the work described here, the ﬁtting to the IMPACT
model will have to be done on a supercomputer.

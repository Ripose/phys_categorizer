Abstract

We present an experimental evidence of a bunch compression scheme that uses a traveling wave accelerating

structure as a compressor. The bunch length issued from a laser-driven radio-frequency electron source was

compressed by a factor >3 using an S-band traveling wave structure located immediately downstream from

the electron source. Experimental data are found to be in good agreement with particle tracking simulations.

INTRODUCTION

In the recent years there has been an increasing demand on ultrashort electron bunches to drive

short-wavelength free-electron lasers and study novel accelerating techniques such as plasma-based

accelerators [1, 2]. Short bunches are commonly obtained by magnetic compression. In this latter

scheme, the bunch is compressed using a series of dipoles arranged in a chicane conﬁguration such

to introduce an energy-dependent pathlength. Therefore an electron bunch having the proper

time-energy correlation can be shortened in the chicane. However, problems inherent to magnetic

compression such as momentum spread and transverse emittance dilution due to the bunch self-

interaction via coherent synchrotron radiation [4] has brought back the idea of bunching the beam

with radio-frequency (rf) structures [5].

It was recently proposed to incorporate the latter method (henceforth named velocity bunching)

into the next photo-injector designs [6]. The velocity bunching relies on the phase slippage between

the electrons and the rf-wave that occurs during the acceleration of non ultra-relativistic electrons.

In this paper after presenting a brief analysis of the velocity bunching scheme, we report on its

exploration at the deep ultraviolet free-electron laser (DUV-FEL) facility of Brookhaven National

Laboratory (BNL). The measurements are compared with numerical simulations performed with

the computer program ASTRA [7].

II. ANALYSIS OF THE VELOCITY BUNCHING TECHNIQUE

In this section we elaborate a simple model that describes how the velocity bunching works. A

more detailed discussion is given in Reference [6].

An electron in an rf traveling wave accelerating structure experiences the longitudinal electric ﬁeld:

Ez(z, t) = Eo sin(ωt

kz + ψo),

−

where Eo is the peak ﬁeld, k the rf wavenumber and ψo the injection phase of the electron with

respect to the rf wave. Let ψ(z, t) = ωt

kz + ψo be the relative phase of the electron w.r.t the

−

wave. The evolution of ψ(t, z) can be expressed as a function of z solely:

The system of coupled diﬀerential equations (2) and (3) with the initial conditions γ(z = 0) = γo

and ψ(z = 0) = ψo describe the longitudinal motion of an electron in the rf structure. Such a

system is solved using the variable separation technique to yield:

dγo.

Hence depending upon the incoming energy and phase extents, the phase of injection in the rf

structure ψo can be tuned to minimize the phase extent after extraction i.e.

to ideally (under

single-particle dynamics) make dψ∞

0. We note that there are two contributions to dψ∞: the

→

ﬁrst term ∂ψ∞/∂ψo comes from the phase slippage (the injection and extraction phases are generally

diﬀerent). The second term ∂ψ∞/∂γo is the contribution coming from the initial energy spread.

To illustrate the compression mechanism we consider a two macro-particles model. In Figure 1 we

present results obtained by numerically integrating the equation of motion for two non-interacting

macro-particles injected into a 3 m long traveling wave structure. Given the incoming phase ∆ψo

and energy ∆γo spreads between the two macro-particles, and the accelerating gradient of the

structure (taken to be 20 MV/m), we can optimize the injection phase to minimize the bunch

length at the structure exit.

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

The measurement was carried out at the DUV-FEL facility of Brookhaven national laboratory [11].

A block diagram of the linear accelerator is given in Fig. 2. The electron bunches of

4 MeV,

∼

generated by a laser-driven rf electron source, are accelerated by a series of four linac sections. The

linac sections consist of 2.856 GHz traveling wave structures operating on the 2π/3 accelerating

mode. The structures are approximately 3 m long and can operate with an average accelerating

voltage up to 20 MV/m. Nominally the bunch is shortened using a magnetic bunch compressor

chicane located between the second and third linac sections. In this latter case, the linac sections

L1, L3, L4 are ran on-crest while the linac L2 is operated to impart the proper time-energy

correlation along the bunch to enable compression as the beam pass through the magnetic chicane.

To investigate the velocity bunching scheme, the linac section L1 was used as a buncher:

its

phase was varied and, for each phase setting, the section L2 was properly phased to maximize the

beam energy with sections L3 and L4 turned oﬀ. The magnetic bunch compressor was turned oﬀ

during the measurement. The nominal settings for the diﬀerent rf and photo-cathode drive-laser

parameters are gathered in Table I.

TABLE I: Nominal settings for the rf-gun, accelerating sections, and the photo-cathode drive-laser. The

values have been directly measured or inferred from the beam properties.

The measurements of bunch length that follow are compared with simulations performed with the

program ASTRA [7]. ASTRA is a macro-particle tracking code based on a rotational symmetric

space charge algorithm.

It incorporates a detailed model for the traveling wave accelerating

structure [8, 9]. To perform the simulations we used the parameters values of Table I. The laser

transverse distribution was modeled by a radially uniform transverse distribution with 0.75 mm

radius, and the time proﬁle, measured using a single shot cross-correlation technique, was directly

loaded into the simulations.

Both time- and frequency-domain techniques were used to characterize the bunching process as the

phase of the linac L1 was varied.

The time-domain charge density was directly measured using the so-called zero-phasing method [12,

13]. In the present case, we use the linac section L3 to cancel the incoming time-energy correlation,

and operate the linac L4 at zero-crossing to introduce a linear time-dependent energy chirp along

the bunch (we have investigated both zero-crossing points). The bunch is then directed to a beam

viewer (“YaG monitor” in Fig. 2) downstream from a 72◦ angle spectrometer. The viewer, located at

a dispersion (horizontal) of η = 907 mm, allows the measurement of the bunch energy distribution.

Unlike in Reference [12], the longitudinal phase space of beams issued from an rf electron source

is not perfectly linear: because of the longitudinal space charge forces, the phase space generally

has a third order distortion [10]. To analyze the impact of such a distortion on our bunch length

measurement method, it is interesting to consider the Gaussian normalized longitudinal phase space

(s, δ) density:

Here σs and σδ are the bunch rms length and rms uncorrelated fractional momentum spread

and h1, h3 are constants that quantify the linear and third order correlations of the longitudinal

phase space. The zero-phasing measurement can then be analyzed in term of a sequence of

numerical calculation based on Eq. 7: by computing and comparing the time and fractional

momentum spread projections associated to

(s, δ + Co

s). The constant Co depends on the

ber krf , and dispersion [12]: Co =

An example of such a calculation is presented in Fig. 3. To generate the presented data

we started with a longitudinal phase space which has a third order distortion but no linear

correlation (as it should be downstream from linac L3) we then set the constant Co to have

a full-width fractional momentum spread of approximately 1.5 % similar to the value imposed

by the ﬁnite size of the viewer (diameter

15 mm) used for the measurement of the bunch

∼

energy distribution. The Figure 3 demonstrates the impact of the third order distortion in

the longitudinal phase space: depending on the chosen zero-crossing phase,

it contributes to

an elongation or a contraction of the measured time proﬁle compared to the real proﬁle. For

the rms bunch length measurements reported hereafter we computed the average bunch length

measured for the two zero-crossing points and reported the diﬀerence as an error bar. For the

reported bunch proﬁles we use the bunch proﬁle corresponding to the case when the phase space has

no fold over. Hence we expect the bunch time-proﬁle reported hereafter to be longer than in reality.

As the phase of the linac section L1 was varied and L2 tuned to maximize the energy gain, the beam

energy was measured. The so-obtained energy variation versus the phase of the linac L1 is compared

with the simulations for the nominal operating point (see Table I) in Fig. 4 and the corresponding

plot for the bunch length is shown in Fig. 5. As predicted, we observed that operating the linac at

lower phases (thereby giving the bunch head less energy than the tail) provides some compression.

The parametric dependence of the rms bunch length on the phase of linac L1 is found to be in

good agreement with the simulation predictions. Two cases of measured and simulated bunch time-

proﬁle are presented in Fig. 6. Again, the agreement between simulation and experiment is fairly

good taking into account the uncertainties associated to the zero-phasing method. Noteworthy is

the achieved peak current of

150 A.

∼

The frequency-domain technique is based on the measurement of the coherent radiation emitted by

the electron bunch via some electromagnetic process. In the coherent regime (i.e. for frequencies

ω

2π/σt where σt is the rms bunch duration) the radiated power scales with the squared charge

∼

and depends on the bunch form factor. Thus it provides indirect informations on the bunch time-

proﬁle. In DUV-FEL, we detect the far-ﬁeld radiation associated to the geometric wake ﬁeld caused

by aperture variation along the accelerator (e.g. the irises of the rf-structure). The radiation shining

out of a single-crystal quartz vacuum window, located prior to the linac section L3, was detected

with a He-cooled bolometer. The detection system, composed of the bolometer and the vacuum

extraction port, can transmit radiation within the frequency range [ωl, ωu]

[1.2, 50] THz. The

≃

lower and upper frequency limits being respectively due to diﬀraction eﬀects related to the ﬁnite

size of the detector and transmission function of the vacuum extraction port. Given the bunch
charge Q and the Fourier transform of the bunch time-proﬁle ˜S(ω), the power is expected to scale

In Figure 8, the measured bolometer output signal versus the phase of L1 is compared with the

expectation (1) calculated from the simulated phase space density and (2) computed from the mea-

sured bunch time proﬁle obtained by zero-phasing. As expected the increase of the coherent signal

is an unambiguous signature of the bunch being compressed (the charge was monitored during the

measurement and remained constant to 200

20 pC).

IV. CONCLUSION

We have measured the bunch length dependence on the phase of a traveling wave accelerating

structure located just downstream from an rf electron source. We could compress the bunch by a

factor ¿3, down to

0.5 ps, for a bunch charge of 200 pC. In our experimental setup, a stronger

∼

compression is currently diﬃcult to achieve without signiﬁcantly impinging the transverse phases-

pace quality. The linac section used for the compression also plays a crucial role in achieving low

emittance since it quickly accelerates the beam at energies of approximately 60 MeV thereby freezing

the transverse phase space. Hence operating the ﬁrst linac far oﬀ-crest reduces the ﬁnal energy
and impact the emittance since transverse space charge forces scale as 1/γ2. An improvement of

our experiment would be to surround the accelerating structure used as a bunch compressor with

a solenoidal lens to enable a better control of the beam transverse envelope and emittance [14, 15].

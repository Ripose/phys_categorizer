Abstract

We explore the NLC linac optics compatible with a low energy scenario where ini-
tially only part of the full linac is installed. Optics modiﬁcation suitable for a low
energy beam running and upgrade to the nominal energy is discussed. Linac pa-
rameters and beam tolerances in the modiﬁed lattice are compared to the nominal

Abstract

We explore the NLC linac optics compatible with a low energy scenario where initially
only part of the full linac is installed. Optics modiﬁcation suitable for a low energy
beam running and upgrade to the nominal energy is discussed. Linac parameters and
beam tolerances in the modiﬁed lattice are compared to the nominal design.

Introduction

We consider a scenario where the NLC [1] is initially built for a lower beam energy than in the
nominal design. The advantage is an earlier start of machine operation at a lower cost since only
part of the full linac may be initially installed. However, the linac design has to be compatible with
the low energy operation and upgrade to the nominal energy. A modiﬁcation of the linac lattice
suitable for the low energy option is discussed. Parameters of the modiﬁed lattice and ground
motion tolerances are compared with the nominal design (based on linac version May 2000).

2 Optics

NLC linac optics (version May 2000) and β functions for a 500 GeV beam are shown in Fig. 1.
The linac has three sectors consisting of FODO cells with accelerator rf-structures placed between
quadrupoles. Compensation of wakeﬁeld eﬀects requires stronger focusing at the low beam energy.
This is achieved using short FODO cells in the ﬁrst sector where each half-cell contains three
accelerator structures. Cells in the second and third sectors are longer and contain six and nine
structures per half-cell, respectively. Phase advance per cell along the ﬁrst and second sectors is
gradually decreased to take into account reduced wakeﬁeld eﬀects with energy.

Let’s consider a scenario where the NLC is initially built for a lower beam energy than in the
nominal design. To reduce the initial machine cost, only the last part of the nominal linac may be
installed for the low energy operation. We assume that injection can be provided at the beginning
of the shorter linac. A schematic of the nominal (500 GeV) and low energy (125 GeV) linacs is
shown in Fig. 2. In this scenario, the low energy linac would occupy part of the third sector of the
full linac where the nominal cells are long. But for a wakeﬁeld compensation the low energy cells
have to be about three times shorter, as in the ﬁrst sector of the linac. It is also desirable to keep
the same lattice for the low and nominal energy operations to reduce the cost of upgrade.

A compromise between the low and full energy optics can be achieved by a simple modiﬁcation

of the nominal cell in the third sector. The original long cell which is described schematically as

where F and D are focusing and defocusing quadrupoles, can be modiﬁed by placing a quadrupole
after every three accelerator structure module (3rf) to generate either three identical short cells for
a low energy linac:

F − 3rf − D − 3rf − F − 3rf − D − 3rf − F − 3rf − D − 3rf,

or one long cell for the nominal energy beam:

F − 3rf − F − 3rf − F − 3rf − D − 3rf − D − 3rf − D − 3rf.

Although the same physical quadrupoles are considered for both regimes, their strengths will be
diﬀerent at low and high energy. Cells in the second sector may be modiﬁed similarly, if needed.

Modiﬁcations (2)-(3) add ﬂexibility to the linac optics, but require many more quadrupoles.
Based on the original design, it is clear that the modiﬁed short cell (2) is acceptable for the low
energy beam since it’s practically identical to the nominal cell in the ﬁrst sector. The modiﬁed
long cell (3) for the full energy beam is similar to the nominal long cell (1) except that F and D
quadrupoles are split in three pieces. The quadrupole splitting increases the combined quadrupole
strength KL and slightly reduces the maximum β functions.

An example of the nominal and modiﬁed long cells in the third sector is shown in Fig. 3 and 4,
where the cell phase advance of 90 degrees is used. The maximum β functions are about 10% lower
in the modiﬁed cell (3) in Fig. 4, but the combined quadrupole strength KL is up ∼60% compared

to the nominal cell. The individual quadrupoles in (3) are a factor of two weaker and therefore may
be as twice as short (for the same K) compared to the nominal quadrupoles. Linear chromaticity

4π P βKL in the nominal and modiﬁed cells is about the same: -0.318 and -0.310, respectively.

Using design lattice for a 500 GeV beam (version May 2000), we estimated linac length when
quadrupoles are placed after every three structures (3rf). In this case, each 12.8 inches gap between
3rf modules in the nominal design is replaced by a quadrupole with 6.275 inches space on both

sides. If the original quadrupoles are used, then the modiﬁed second and third sectors would be
77.7 m and 699.5 m longer, respectively, and the full linac would be longer by 777.2 m. However,
if shorter quadrupoles are used in the modiﬁed lattice, the length increase could be reduced by a
half.

To generate a 500 GeV linac with a quadrupole after every three structures, we used a specially
written code: “Linac 05” [2]. It automatically generates matched lattice for a three sector linac
with F-3rf-D-3rf cells in the ﬁrst sector, F-3rf-F-3rf-D-3rf-D-3rf cells in the second sector, and F-
3rf-F-3rf-F-3rf-D-3rf-D-3rf-D-3rf cells in the third sector, where realistic spaces between magnets
and accelerator structures are used. For an estimate, we used phase advance of 90 degrees per cell
in the modiﬁed lattice. Short 12.75 inches quadrupoles were used throughout the modiﬁed linac
to minimize the total length. Some other linac parameters were updated as well compared to the
original design. The resultant β functions are shown in Fig. 5.

Linac parameters for the original and modiﬁed lattices are listed in Table 1. The nominal linac
in Table 1 also includes a 114 m post-linac diagnostic section while the modiﬁed linac does not.
The main disadvantage of the modiﬁed lattice is that it requires a larger number of individual
quadrupoles. However, Table 1 represents a conservative approach where both sectors 2 and 3
are modiﬁed. In principle, the nominal optics could be kept unchanged in the second sector and
beginning of the third sector which would reduce the number of additional quadrupoles.

3 Tolerances at 500 GeV/beam

To compare alignment tolerances in the nominal and modiﬁed lattices for a 500 GeV beam, we com-
puted eﬀects of ground motion on beam emittance and beam jitter using the “Tolerance” code [3].
This code analytically calculates tolerances on quadrupole and rf-structure rms displacements for
6% emittance dilution and beam jitter amplitude of 25% of beam size. An approximation is used
where the entire space between quadrupoles is ﬁlled with accelerator structures. This way, the total

length of structures is slightly increased and the accelerator gradient is correspondingly reduced
to maintain the same energy gain. The following beam parameters were used in the tolerance
calculation:

• 3×10−6 and 3×10−8 m for x and y normalized emittance, respectively
• 1.1×1010 particles per bunch
• 150 µm for rms bunch length
• 1.29×1020 V/C/m3 for transverse wakeﬁeld slope in the structures.
The computed tolerances are shown in Table 2. One can see that diﬀerence between the nominal
and modiﬁed linac tolerances are small. Therefore, the modiﬁed lattice is acceptable for running
at the full beam energy. This lattice has more optical ﬂexibility than the nominal lattice, but at
the expense of using many more quadrupoles.

4 Summary

We described a modiﬁcation of the NLC linac lattice suitable for initial low energy beam running
as well as an upgrade to the nominal energy. In this lattice, the long cells in the last segment of
the linac are replaced by shorter cells with quadrupoles placed after every three rf-structures. The

modiﬁcation is optimal for the low energy beam running and provides acceptable ground motion
tolerances at the nominal energy. The main disadvantages of the modiﬁed optics are a larger
number of quadrupoles needed for a full energy beam and up to 4% longer linac.

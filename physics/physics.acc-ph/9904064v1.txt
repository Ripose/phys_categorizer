Abstract

An interpretation of the the “halo puzzle” in accelerators based on
quantum-like diﬀraction is given. Comparison between this approach and
the others based on classical mechanics equations is exhibited.

Keywords: Beam physics, Beam optics, Accelerator optics, Quantum-like, Beam
halo, Beam losses, Stochasticity.

In this note we point out that, after linearizing the Schr¨odinger-like equa-
tion, for beams in an accelerator one can use the whole apparatus of quantum
mechanics, with a new interpretation of the basic parameters (for instance the
Planck’s constant ¯h
ǫ where ǫ is the normalized beam emittance) and intro-
xi, ti) of the Feynman theory for both longitudinal
duce the propagator K (xf , tf |
and transversal motion. A procedure of this sort seems particularly eﬀective for
a global description of several phenomena such as intrabeam scattering, space-
charge, particle focusing, that cannot be treated easily in detail by “classical
mechanics” and are considered to be the main cause of the creation of the “Halo”
around the beam line with consequent losses of particles.

Let us indeed consider the Schr¨odinger like equation for the beam wave

function

in the linearized case U (x, t) does not depend on the density
normalized transversal beam emittance deﬁned as follows:

˜ǫ being the emittance usually considered, where as we may introduce the analog
of the De Broglie wavelength as λ = ǫ/p. We now focus our attention on
the one dimensional transversal motion along the x-axis of the beam particles
belonging to a single bunch and assume a Gaussian transversal proﬁle for a
particles injected in to a circular machine. We describe all the interactions
mentioned above, that cannot be treated in detail, as diﬀraction eﬀects by a
phenomenological boundary deﬁned by a slit, in each segment of the particle
trajectory. This condition should be applied to both beam wave function and its
corresponding beam propagator K. The result of such a procedure is a multiple
integral that determines the actual propagator between the initial and ﬁnal
states in terms of the space-time intervals due to the intermediate segments.

1 PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES

Preliminary numerical estimates based on the above formulae for the two dif-
ferent cases of LHC [3] and HIDIF [4] designs give the following encouraging
results:

2 CONCLUSION

These preliminary numerical results are encouraging because they predict halo
losses which seem under control. Indeed the HIDIF scenario gives a total loss of
beam power per meter which is about a thousand higher than the LHC. However
in both cases the estimated losses appear much smaller than the 1 Watt/m.

Abstract. We investigate the solutions to the Lorentz–Dirac equation and
show that its solution ﬂow has a structure identical to the one of renor-
malization group ﬂows in critical phenomena. The physical solutions of the
Lorentz–Dirac equation lie on the critical surface. The critical surface is
repelling, i.e. any slight deviation from it is ampliﬁed and as a result the so-
lution runs away to inﬁnity. On the other hand, Dirac’s asymptotic condition
(acceleration vanishes for long times) forces the solution to be on the critical
manifold. The critical surface can be determined perturbatively. Thereby
one obtains an eﬀective second order equation, which we apply to various
cases, in particular to the motion of an electron in a Penning trap.

The Lorentz–Dirac equation governs the motion of a classical charge in
prescribed external electromagnetic ﬁelds and including radiation reaction,
i.e. the loss of energy due to radiation. In standard relativistic notation it
reads [1]

m ˙vµ = eF µν(x)vν + (e2/6πc3)[¨vµ −

1
c2 ˙vλ ˙vλvµ] .

(1)

Here m is the (experimental) rest mass of the particle with charge e. xµ(s) is
the world line and vµ(s) = ˙xµ(s) the velocity of the charge parametrized in

1

its eigentime s. The particle is subject to time–independent external ﬁelds
as given through the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor F µν. The ﬁrst term in (1)
is the Lorentz force while the second term describes the radiation reaction.
One obvious issue is to understand how the Lorentz–Dirac equation is
related to the Maxwell–Lorentz equations with a suitable ultraviolet cut–
oﬀ. This problem was studied extensively by Abraham, Lorentz, and many
others, cf.
In his famous paper [3], Dirac
circumvented the issue through a somewhat delicate splitting of the ﬁelds
generated by a point charge. The, to our knowledge most complete formal
derivation of (1) has been worked out by Nodvik [4]. Some rigorous results
are [5, 6, 7]. For the purpose of this letter we regard the Lorentz–Dirac
equation as given.

[1, 2] for a detailed account.

As noted already by Dirac, Eq. (1) has runaway solutions which grow ex-
ponentially in time, simply because for F µν = 0 and in the approximation of
small velocities we have m ˙v = (e2/6πc3)¨v. Dirac [3], reemphasized by Haag
[8], postulated that the physical solutions to (1) must satisfy the asymptotic
˙vµ(s) = 0, which, as extra bonus, is a substitute for the miss-
condition lim
s→∞
ing initial condition ¨x(0). The validity of the asymptotic condition has been
tested only in explicit cases [1, 9, 10]. With a general external ﬁeld tensor
F µν the solution behavior of (1) might be complicated and should expected
to be chaotic. Physical and unphysical solutions might be thoroughly mixed.
Thus in principle, for given x(0), ˙x(0), there could be many solutions satisfy-
ing the asymptotic condition. Which one to pick then? On a more practical
level, one would like to have a reliable numerical scheme not hampered by
the instability of physical solutions.

The purpose of this letter is to explain that the solution ﬂow of the
Lorentz–Dirac equation has a structure familiar from the renormalization
group ﬂows in critical phenomena. The physical solutions lie on the critical
surface, which contains attractive ﬁxed points whose location depends on
F µν. Slightly oﬀ the critical surface, the solution grows exponentially fast,
low, temperature ﬁxed point. Our
so to speak it ﬂows to the high, resp.
observation has two important implications.
(1) The critical manifold is
actually a surface of the form ¨x = h(x, ˙x). Thus, for given initial conditions
x(0), ˙x(0), there is exactly one solution on the critical surface and, as to

second order equation, given below, which governs the motion on the critical
surface. Thus the initial value problem is restored and the equation can

esasily be solved numerically. We will demonstrate the predictive power of
the second order equation by a few examples, still handled without numerical
integration, the physically most relevant of which is the motion of an electron
in a Penning trap [12]. (This system was pointed out to us by Wolfgang
Schleich).

In all applications the radiation reaction is a small correction to the
Lorentz force equation, which means that the radiation reaction term, the
highest derivative in (1), carries a small prefactor. Diﬀerential equations of
such a type have been studied extensively through singular (or geometric)
perturbation theory [13, 14], which is closely connected to the theory of cen-
ter manifolds. The application to the Lorentz-Dirac equation is a little bit
messy and has been carried out in [7]. Rather than trying to summarize these
results, we believe it to be more instructive to illustrate the basic features of
the method by using a ﬁctituous mathematical example.

Let us consider then the ordinary diﬀerential equation of the form

˙x = g(x, y) ,

ε ˙y = y − h(x) ,

(2)

x(t) ∈ R, y(t) ∈ R. We want to understand the behavior of solutions for
small ε. If we simply set ε = 0, the second equation reduces to y = h(x)
and therefore ˙x = g(x, h(x)). The ambient phase space has disappeared and
the motion takes place only on the one–dimensional surface {y = h(x)}. On
the other hand we can go over to the slow time scale τ, τ = ε−1t. Denoting
diﬀerentiation with respect to τ by ′, (2) reads

x′ = εg(x, y) ,

y′ = y − h(x) .

Setting now ε = 0, yields x′ = 0, i.e. x(τ ) = x0 and y′ = y − h(x0).
Thus the surface {y = h(x)} consists exclusively of repelling ﬁxed points.
If y(0) 6= h(x0), the solution grows exponentially. In this sense the surface
{y = h(x)} is critical. The main result of geometric singular perturbation
theory is that for small ε the critical surface persists and is of the form
{y = hε(x)}. On the critical surface the motion is governed by

(3)

(4)

˙x = g(x, hε(x)) .

If x(0), y(0) are oﬀ the critical surface, the solution to (2) diverges exponen-
tially with rate 1/ε.

Of course, abstractly only the existence of hε is asserted.

Its concrete
form must be extracted from (2). Fortunately we are allowed to determine

3

hε perturbatively (which is not the case for individual solutions). We make
the ansatz y = hε(x) = h0(x) + εh1(x) + O(ε2) and insert in (2). This results
in ε ˙y = εh′
0(x)g(x, h0(x))+O(ε2) = h0(x)+εh1(x)−h(x)+
O(ε2). Comparing orders of ε yields h0(x) = h(x), h1(x) = h′
0(x)g(x, h0(x)).
Inserting in (4), we have the eﬀective equation of motion

0(x) ˙x+O(ε2) = εh′

˙x = g(x, h(x)) + ε∂yg(x, h(x))h′(x)g(x, h(x)) ,

(5)

valid up to an error of order ε2.

Returning to the Lorentz–Dirac equation, by the same argument it has a
repelling critical surface of the form {¨x = h(x, ˙x)}. To understand the motion
on the critical surface we ﬁx one inertial frame and denote the position and
velocity three–vectors by r(t), u(t). If φ is the external electrostatic potential,
then the energy balance reads

[γmc2 + eφ(r) − (e2/6πc3)γ4(u · ˙u)]
= −(e2/6πc3)[γ4 ˙u2 + c−2γ6(u · ˙u)2]

(6)

(7)

1 − u2/c2. We integrate both sides of (6) in time. Since on
with γ = 1/
the critical manifold the Schott term −(e2/6πc3)γ4(u · ˙u) is bounded, we
conclude that

on the critical surface. This is possible only if the asymptotic condition
˙u(t) = 0 holds. Oﬀ the critical manifold ˙u(t) diverges. Thus given
lim
t→∞
r(0), ˙r(0), the asymptotic condition singles out the unique ¨r(0) on the critical
surface.

Inserting the asymptotic condition in (1), we see that −∇φ(r(t)) → 0 as
t → ∞, which implies in essence two distinct scenarios. (i) The particle is
scattered into a region where F νµ = 0. Then u(t) has a limit as t → ∞ and
r(t) grows linearly. (ii) The motion is bounded. Then the particle comes to
u(t) = 0, at a point where the electrostatic force, −∇φ, vanishes.

t→∞
Note that in general the condition −∇φ(r∞) = 0 does not determine the
asymptotic position r∞. E.g. a uniform magnetic ﬁeld is conﬁning even for
φ(r) = 0.

In analogy to (5), our next task is to derive an eﬀective second order
equation for the motion on the critical surface. We follow the steps leading
to (5) and obtain

m ˙vµ = eF µν(x)vν + (e2/6πc3){(e/m)vσ(∂σF µν(x))vν
+(e/m)2F µα(x)F ν

α (x)vν + (e/mc)2F σα(x)F ν

α (x)vσvνvµ} .

(8)

In principle one could compute also higher order terms. But they have the
same magnitude as those contributions neglected already in the derivation
of the Lorentz–Dirac equation. In addition (8) correctly describes the long
time behavior as dominated by radiation reaction. Higher orders yield no
qualitative change and, at best, make a minute correction of relative order
10−24 or even smaller in concrete examples.

Eq. (8) appears in the second volume of the course in theoretical physics
by Landau and Lifshitz [11], who were guided by the insight that radiation
reaction must have a small eﬀect. One can only speculate why the Landau
and Lifshitz equation (8) is apparently ignored in the literature. For sure,
they do not discuss the structure of the ﬂow with its critical manifold nor
the relation to the asymptotic condition.

There are several cases of interest where the solution to (8) can still be
handled analytically. The ﬁrst one is a vanishing magnetic ﬁeld and an
electrostatic potential varying only along the 2–axis. Setting r = (0, y, 0),
u = (0, ˙y, 0), eφ(r) = V (y), the one–dimensional motion is governed by

d
dt

(mγ ˙y) = −V ′(y) − (e2/6πc3)(1/m)V ′′(y)γ ˙y .

(9)

If V is convex, the energy is damped monotonically. The particular case of
a quadratic potential is studied in the recent third edition of the textbook
by Jackson [15] in the context of line breadth and level shift of a radiating
oscillator. However, if V is periodic, say V (y) = V0 cos(k0y), then at the
maxima the particle gains in energy from the near ﬁeld, a process dominated
by the energy loss at the minima. For long times the particle comes to
rest. Also if V has a linear piece, then in this spatial interval the charge is
accelerated without friction.

An experimentally more accessible set–up is the motion in a uniform

magnetic ﬁeld (0, 0, B). Then (8) simpliﬁes to

d
dt

(mγu) = eBu⊥ − (e2/6πc3)(eB/m)2γ2u

(10)

with u = (u1, u2, 0) = u(cos ϕ, sin ϕ, 0), u⊥ = (−u2, u1, 0). Setting α =
e2/6πmc3 and the cyclotron frequency ωc = eB/m, one obtains du/dϕ =
−αωcϕ, i.e. u(ϕ) = u(0) exp[−αωcϕ]. For electrons αωc = 8.8×10−18B[Gauss],
which shows that radiative reaction is very small even at high ﬁelds. The
charge spirals to its central rest point. Using (10) the radius shrinks as

r(t) = r0e−αω2

c t/(1 + (γ − 1)((1 − e−2αω2

c t)/2)) .

(11)

In the ultrarelativistic regime, γ ≫ 1, (11) simpliﬁes to r(t) = r0(1 +
c t)−1, provided αω2

c t ≪ 1. To have some order of magnitude, in the

case of an electron, αω2
10−3(γ/(B[Gauss])) m. Thus for B = 103 Gauss and an ultrarelativistic
γ = 6 × 104 the radius shrinks within 0.9 sec from its initial value r0 = 10 cm
to r = 1 µm, at which time the electron has made 2 × 1014 revolutions. Only
then the power law, (1 + t)−1, crosses over to an exponential damping.

Our third example is the motion of an electron in a Penning trap [12].
The electron is subject to a uniform magnetic ﬁeld, as before, and in addition
to the electrostatic quadrupol potential

A non–relativistic approximation suﬃces and in (8) we only keep terms to
linear order. Then the in–plane and axial motion decouple and satisfy, with

works only for a single mode.

Note that ω− < ω+ and therefore γ− < 0 which reﬂects that a loss of
energy due to radiation lowers the potential energy and increases the orbit
size. In practice ωc/2π = 164 GHz and ωz/2π = 62 MHz. Inserting in (15)

To summarize, we have investigated the solution ﬂow of the Lorentz–Dirac
equation and discovered that in its structure it is identical to renormaliza-
tion group ﬂows in critical phenomena. The physical solutions are on the
critical manifold and are governed there by an eﬀective second order equa-
tion. This equation is not plagued by the diﬃculties usually associated with

and have the correct long–time behavior. Our examples show how radiation
damping can be handled systematically and with ease. It would be of in-
terest to have more stringent experimental tests. E.g. one could decrease
the magnetic ﬁeld in the Penning trap, so that the two modes mix better,
and try to reach the resonance point ω2
z , where the life–times should
vanish according to (15). A further interesting possibility is to turn the mag-
netic ﬁeld out of the symmetry axis. Then all three modes mix resulting in
damping coeﬃcients which can be understood only on the basis of (8).

I am most grateful to Fritz Rohrlich for instructive discussions and for the
hint that the independently derived Eq. (8) appeared in Landau and Lifshitz
already a long time ago. I am indebted to Wolfgang Schleich for pointing
out the Penning trap as an interesting application. I thank M. Rauscher for
details on synchroton sources.

Ultimate parameters of the photon collider at the ILC ∗

V. I. Telnov †

Abstract. At linear colliders, the e+e− luminosity is limited by beam-collision effects, which
determine the required emittances of beams in damping rings (DRs). While in γγ collisions at the
photon collider, these effects are absent, and so smaller emittances are desirable. In present damping
rings designs, nominal DR parameters correspond to those required for e+e− collisions. In this note,
I would like to stress once again that as soon as we plan the photon-collider mode of ILC operation,
the damping-ring emittances are dictated by the photon-collider requirements—namely, they should
be as small as possible. This can be achieved by adding more wigglers to the DRs; the incremental
cost is easily justiﬁed by a considerable potential improvement of the γγ luminosity. No expert
analysis exists as of yet, but it seems realistic to obtain a factor ﬁve increase of the γγ luminosity
compared to the “nominal” DR design.

1. Introduction

It is well known and publicized that in addition to e+e− physics, linear colliders provide
a unique opportunity to study γγ and γe interactions at high energy and luminosity [1–5].
The physics in γγ, γe collisions is very rich [6,3,7,8]. The photon collider almost doubles
the ILC physics program, while the increase of the total cost is only a few percent.

The next few years are very important for the photon collider. Everything that is required
for the photon collider must be properly included in the basic ILC design. It is important
to continue the development of the physics program and start the development of the laser
system, which is a key element of the photon collider. However, even more urgent are the
accelerator and interaction-region aspects, which inﬂuence the ILC design and determine
the parameters of the photon collider.

At this workshop (LCWS06), I would like to emphasize two very important problems of
the photon collider that require special attention of ILC designers: 1) attaining the ultimate
luminosities (this article), 2) the layout of the photon collider at the ILC [9].

2. Towards high γγ, γe luminosities

p

The γγ luminosity at the photon collider at ILC energies is determined by the geo-
metric luminosity of electron beams [10,11,3]. There is an approximate general rule:
the luminosity in the high-energy part of spectrum Lγγ ∼ 0.1Lgeom, where Lgeom =
ǫnxǫny βxβy. Compared to the e+e− case, where the minimum transverse
N 2νγ/4π
beam sizes are determined by beamstrahlung and beam instability, the photon collider
needs a smaller product of horizontal and vertical emittances and a smaller horizontal beta-
function.

The “nominal” (for e+e−) ILC beam parameters are: N = 2 × 1010, σz = 0.3 mm,
ν = 14100 Hz, ǫnx = 10−5 m, ǫny = 4 × 10−8 m. Obtaining βy ∼ σz = 0.3 mm
is not a problem, while the minimum value of the horizontal β–function is restricted by
chromo-geometric aberrations in the ﬁnal-focus system [3]. For the above emittances, the
limit on the effective horizontal beta-function is about 5 mm [12,15]. The expected γγ
luminosity Lγγ(z > 0.8zm) ∼ 3.5 × 1033 cm−2s−1 ∼ 0.17 Le+e− (here the nominal
Le+e− = 2 × 1034 cm−2s−1) [12]. Taking into account that cross sections in γγ are larger
than those in e+e− collisions by one order of magnitude, the number of events will be
somewhat larger than in e+e− collisions even for the “nominal” case.

The above γγ luminosity corresponds to the beam parameters optimized for the e+e−
collisions, where the luminosity is determined by collision effects. The photon collider
has no such restriction and can work with much smaller beam sizes. The horizontal beam
size at the considered parameters (in the γγ case) is σx ≈ 300 nm, while the simulation
shows that the photon collider at such energies can work even with σx ∼ 10 nm without
fundamental limitations [10,11,3]. So, the nominal beam parameters are very far from the
physics limits and we should do everything possible to minimize transverse beam sizes at
the photon collider!

Note, the minimum βx depends on the horizontal emittance: about 5 mm for the
nominal emittance and 3.7 (2.2) mm for emittances reduced by a factor of 2 (4), re-
spectively [15,12]. In the TESLA, emittances close to the latter case were considered:
ǫnx = 0.25 × 10−5, ǫny = 3 × 10−8 m, which give the γγ luminosity a factor of 3.5
higher!

The minimum emittances are determined by various physics effects in damping rings
such as quantum ﬂuctuations in synchrotron radiation and intra-beam scattering (IBS).
The latter is the most difﬁcult to overcome. Where is the limit? One of the possible ways
to reduce emittances is decreasing the damping time by adding wigglers [14]. There are no
detailed considerations by experts yet. There are many effects in damping rings, and one
should believe only careful done studies. Nevertheless, I would like to make some rough
estimates.

ﬂuctuations [13]

If wigglers ﬁll 1/3 of the DR, then for B0 = 2 T and E = 5 GeV one gets Ts =
7.5 × 10−4 sec, which is more than 20 times smaller than the damping time in present
designs.

For λw = 10 cm and βx = 5 m, the equilibrium normalized emittance due to syn-
chrotron radiation is ǫnx = 1.3 × 10−7 m, which is 60 times smaller than the present
nominal emittance. The vertical emittance will be much smaller as well.

The second effect limiting the emittance is the intra-beam scattering (IBS). The
growth time for IBS at ǫx/ǫy = const depends on the emittances roughly as 1/T IBS ∼
2 [16,17], where b is a coefﬁcient that depends on the DR structure and only slightly
b/ǫx
on ǫx.

In presence of both synchrotron radiation and IBS, the emittance is damped as

where ǫ ≡ ǫx, Ts is the radiation damping time, ǫs the equilibrium emittance in the
absence of IBS. This equation gives the equilibrium emittance in the presence of IBS:

In the present DR design, IBS adds about 20% to ǫs [17] (i.e., ǫ0 = 1.2ǫs), which gives
bTs ∼ 0.25ǫ2

new equilibrium emittance in IBS dominated DR would be

time by factor of 5, the resulting emittance

So, it would seem that there are a lot of resources for decreasing the damping time and thus
decreasing emittances in x, y directions, as well as βx. Until βx,y > σz (the hour-glass
effect) and σy > 1 nm [18] there is a strong dependence of the luminosity on emittances
(L ∝ 1/
ǫnx ǫny βx, βy). The decrease of the damping time will need more RF peak
power, but this problem is solvable. The tune shift due to the beam space charge may be
not important due to strong damping.

Let us assume, as an optimistic goal, a reduction (compared to the nominal beam pa-
rameters) of ǫnx by a factor of 6, ǫny by a factor of 4, and βx down to 1.7 mm (which is
possible for such emittances). Then, one can have the following parameters for the pho-
ton collider: N = 2 × 1010, ν = 14 kHz, ǫnx = 1.5 × 10−6 m, ǫny = 1. × 10−8 m,
βx = 1.7 mm, βy = 0.3 mm, the distance between interaction and conversion regions is
1 mm, σx = 72 nm, σy = 2.5 nm, Lgeom = 2.5 × 1035, Lγγ(z > 0.8zm) ∼ 2.5 × 1034
cm−2s−1 ∼ 1.25Le+e−, nomin.. The resulting γγ luminosity is larger than at the nominal
beam parameters by a factor of 7. This is very attractive and needs a serious consideration
by DR experts !

The (interesting) event rate in γγ collisions will be higher than in e+e− by one order of
magnitude. This opens new possibilities, such as the study of Higgs self-coupling in γγ
collisions just above the γγ → hh threshold [19].

Figure 1 shows simulated luminosity spectra for these parameters. All important effects
are taken into account. In the ﬁgure on the right, only one of the electron beams is converted
to photons, it is more preferable for γe studies due to easier luminosity measurement [20]
and smaller backgrounds. The corresponding luminosities Lγγ(z > 0.8zm) ∼ 2.5 × 1034

conversion and interaction regions, one can obtain a much more monochromatic luminosity
spectrum with reduced luminosity for study of QCD processes [21].

I want to stress again that parameters of the ILC damping rings are dictated not by e+e−,
but by γγ collisions and a decision on the DR design should be based on the dependence
Lγγ = f (DR cost). It could be that the increase of the γγ luminosity by a factor of 7, as
suggested above, is too difﬁcult, but even a 3–5 times improvement will be very useful.
This is a very important and urgent task !

One more remark. The photon collider does not need positrons, so one can consider a
scheme without damping rings at all. Unfortunately, the product of emittances in polarized
electron guns is larger than in damping rings, though progress is possible. A more radical
improvement can be provided by the laser cooling [22,23], where intense laser beams are
used instead of wigglers. In this case, the cooling process is very fast, there is no IBS,
etc. Preliminary estimates show that the γγ luminosity can be increased by a factor of 30.
However, it is too early to consider this method seriously, but it should be kept in mind for
the seconds stage of the photon collider, the “γγ factory”.

In summary, in order to have a high luminosity at the photon collider, damping rings with
emittances much smaller than for e+e− are required. No serious study has been done
yet. It is not excluded that optimized wiggler-dominated storage rings would allow a γγ

dling smaller horizontal emittance should be foreseen in designs of all ILC system (bunch
compression, big bend, etc.).

QUANTUM EXCITATION-FREE RADIATION EMISSION
INCLUDING MULTIPLE SCATTERING

ULRIK I. UGGERHØJ

Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Aarhus
DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark

In order to increase the luminosity of electron-positron colliders it is desirable to
ﬁnd a means to reduce the phase-space of the beams. The transverse cooling of
positrons imposed by the quantum excitation-free radiation emission in a single
crystal is considered as a potential route to achieving ultra-cold beams. An anal-
ysis of the problem is presented, including an evaluation of the contribution from
multiple scattering during the passage. The analysis shows that an emittance re-
duction may be achieved in special cases, but in general the emittance will increase
as a result of the multiple scattering.

1. Introduction

In a series of theoretical papers, the quantum excitation-free radiation emis-
sion in a single crystal has been discussed 1,2. It is shown that the transverse
action - and thereby the emittance - decreases exponentially towards the
minimum value ~/2, corresponding to an emittance of half of the Comp-
ton wavelength. This applies as long as the radiation is in the undulator
regime where the angle of emission is larger than the pitch angle. On the
other hand, experiments 3 have been performed which in agreement with
theoretical expectations based on a completely diﬀerent analysis show that
positrons in contrast to electrons generally suﬀer heating instead of cool-
ing. The present work is motivated by two things: The desire to estimate
the potential of single crystals as ‘devices’ for the production of ultra-cold
beams and a wish to ﬁnd a consensus between two apparently diﬀerent the-
oretical approaches and experimental results. In the following the outline
of 2 is followed, with the inclusion of multiple scattering, and it is shown
that for the experiment one should indeed expect heating as concluded from
both theories. Finally, it is shown that in special cases it is expected that
transverse cooling can be achieved.

2. Channeling, multiple scattering and dechanneling

The large ﬁelds present near the nuclei in solid materials may in the case
of single crystals add coherently such that a penetrating particle experi-
ences a continuous ﬁeld along its direction of motion - the so-called contin-
uum approximation 4. If further the particle is incident with a suﬃciently
small angle to a particular crystallographic direction, inside the so-called
Lindhard angle, the negatively/positively charged particle is constrained to
move near/far from the nuclei and the electron clouds surrounding these.
This is the channeling phenomenon 4 which has found widespread applica-
tions in physics. For a general introduction to channeling and applications,
see eg. 5. The critical angle for planar channeling is given by

ψp =

4Z1Z2e2N dpCaTF/pv

(1)

where Z1e is the charge of the penetrating particle, Z2e that of the lattice
nuclei, p the momentum, v the velocity, N dp is the planar density of atoms,
√3 is Lindhard’s
N being the atomic density and dp the planar spacing, C
≃
constant and aTF is the Thomas-Fermi screening distance.

Figure 1. The ﬁgure shows as a function of reduced transverse position, x/dp, a) the
transverse potential in the Moli`ere and harmonic approximations and b) the electron
density calculated from Poisson’s equation.

In the continuum approximation, the resulting transverse potential leads
to a continuously focusing environment in which photon emission may take
place without recoil to the emitting particle, the recoil being absorbed by
the lattice. This is the so-called ’semi-classical channeling radiation reac-
tion’ 1,2. In the previous papers on this phenomenon two main assumptions
are made: The particle is moving in a harmonic potential and the energy of
the photons emitted is small compared to the energy of the particle. Disre-
garding for the moment the potentially important case of axially channeled
positrons along a crystal axis, this leaves only planar channeled positrons
since channeled electrons are in a strongly anharmonic potential. Axially
channeled positrons may be conﬁned to a region between certain strings if
their transverse energy is very low, so-called proper channeled positrons. In
this case the transverse potential can be well approximated by a harmonic
potential, see e.g. 6. As seen from ﬁgure 1a, the harmonic approximation
is clearly well suited for positive particles.

reduced transverse position, x/dp, for a p = 25 GeV/c beam in silicon.

The transfer of channeled particles to states above the barrier, so-called
random, is referred to as dechanneling. The length, LD, over which a planar
channeled beam of protons has been reduced to the fraction 1/e of the initial
intensity by transfer to the random beam is given for γ

agreement with measured values of LD at room temperature 8. Due to the
dependence of electron density on transverse position, see ﬁgure 1a, the
dechanneling process which is a result of the multiple scattering depends
itself on the transverse position and therefore on the transverse energy. In
ﬁgure 2 is shown the squared scattering angle per unit distance, ∆θ2/∆z,
for a p = 25 GeV/c beam in silicon. For low transverse energies, the
multiple scattering is dominated by the interaction with electrons and it is
observed that ∆θ2/∆z is almost a factor of two lower for the more accurate
Moli`ere approximation than for the harmonic potential (for the Moli`ere
approximation, see e.g. 9).

arises due to a steady increase of the transverse energy imposed by mul-
tiple scattering, i.e. the transverse energy increases as dEx/dz = U0/LD.
Therefore the transverse action increases as dJx/dt = U0c/LDωz, but since
the eﬀective dechanneling length depends on the transverse energy approx-
imately as LD = LD0U0/Jxωz, the transverse action changes according to

In ﬁgure 3 is shown the pitch angle calculated as a function of normalized
penetration time, t/τc, for 25 GeV positrons in a (110) diamond, with
and without inclusion of the multiple scattering. It is seen that while the
cooling starts around t/τc = 0.1 without multiple scattering, it is postponed

In ﬁgure 4 is shown the diﬀerent behaviours for several angles of in-
cidence, calculated for tungsten (110). Strong cooling is found to appear

early for small values of the angle of incidence, but for tungsten cτc ≃
which means that even for small angles there will be a strong inﬂuence from
incoherent scattering.

In ﬁgure 5 is shown results for silicon and germanium showing that for
light materials, where the lattice is not very compact as in diamond, the
inﬂuence of multiple scattering is much stronger than for heavier ones.

To get an impression of the variation of the cooling eﬀect as a function
of energy in ﬁgure 6 is shown the results for 4 diﬀerent energies. Clearly,
as the energy increases, the inﬂuence of multiple scattering diminishes and
cooling starts earlier.

the dotted curves do not include this eﬀect.

As a crude estimate, the axial potential can be approximated by a har-
monic potential with barrier height equal to that found by the Moli`ere
potential. The two kinds of motions in the planar and axial channeling
cases are very diﬀerent and it is not expected to get anything but an indi-

7 is shown the results obtained by this procedure for two energies and we
note that in this case the characteristic cooling length is much shorter than
X0. This indicates that the much stronger axial ﬁelds may indeed provide
substantial cooling.

In 11 calculations of the transverse cooling including multiple scatter-
ing have also been performed. However, in order to present a fully self-
consistent model, the authors have chosen to model the electron density by
solving the Poisson equation for the harmonic potential. This yields an elec-
tron density which is constant as a function of transverse position and may
underestimate the net cooling eﬀect as a cause of this. On the other hand,
in 11 scattering ‘on ﬂuctuations of the planar potential’, i.e. the nuclear
contribution is not taken into account either. The analysis presented here
supplements that of Baier and Katkov 11 in producing essentially the same
conclusion by use of a diﬀerent approach: Only under special circumstances
may a penetrating particle experience a net cooling eﬀect.

5. Conclusions

Qualitative agreement among two diﬀerent theoretical approaches and an
experiment on radiative angular cooling is shown. This gives considerable
conﬁdence in the predictions, especially of the semi-classical channeling ra-

diation reaction approach. Furthermore, for this approach multiple scatter-
ing is included to obtain a more realistic estimate of the cooling properties.
Rough estimates show that for existing positron beams a strong cooling
eﬀect may be achievable by means of axial channeling in a
20 mm thick
diamond crystal. There are however still open questions which deserve
attention, among others that of dilution of the longitudinal phase-space
due to the severe straggling in energy loss and the possibility of cooling
simultaneously in both transverse directions by proper axial channeling or
channeling in carbon nanotubes 12.

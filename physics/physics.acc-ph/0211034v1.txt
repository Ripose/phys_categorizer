A new type of charge-exchange injection scheme for high-intensity proton rings that use a laser
beam and an undulator magnet is proposed. The elementary stripping process is resonant photoion-
ization via a broad Stark state formed by the Stark eﬀect at an energy level near the peak of the
potential barrier. The method used to estimate the parameters of the necessary laser beam and
magnetic ﬁeld is described. As an application to an actual accelerator, a laser stripping system using
a high-ﬁnesse Fabry-Perot resonator and an undulator is proposed. An estimation of the photon
loss due to the pumping-up of H0 atoms, tunability of the system and the emittance growth due to
stripping in the undulator magnet is also given.

INTRODUCTION

Thin foils of carbon or alminum oxide are very convenient for stripping media for H− charge-exchange injection
into a proton ring. However, two serious problems come to the fore for such MW-class proton rings as drivers of the
next-generation neutron sources or neutrino factories. One is a serious degradation of the foil performance due to
heating to an extremely high temperature by the energy deposit of traversing protons. The other is activation of the
accelerator components by high-energy protons scattered by foil atoms [1].

In order to avoid these problems, stripping methods without foils have been studied from several years ago. Those
methods usually combine Lorentz stripping and the excitation of H0 atoms by laser pumping. Here, Lorentz stripping
means stripping an electron from an H− ion or an H0 atom using the Lorentz force that acts on charged particles
with a velocity in a magnetic ﬁeld [2, 3, 4].

With respect to the Lorentz stripping of an H− beam, we well know about the experiences of the PSR (Proton
Storage Ring) at Los Alamos National Laboratory [5]. A two-step H0 injection scheme, that used neutralization of
H− beams by Lorentz stripping for the ﬁrst step, has ﬁnally been converted to direct H− injection without Lorentz
stripping, because the controllability of the beam size at the foil was very low for H0 beams. Since the beam size of
H0 beams could not be reduced suﬃciently, neither the area of the stripping foil that protons captured in the ring
hit, nor the foil-hit number of the captured proton beam could be suﬃciently reduced. However, there is a suggestion
that the reason for the low controllability of the H0 beam size at the foil is the foil location in PSR, and that perfect
matching of the H0 beam to the ring optics is possible by choosing the foil location [6]. In any case, these problems
will not take place if a stripping foil is not used. In addition, when the energy of the H− beam becomes higher, the
dissociation probability of H− ions by the Lorentz force becomes higher, and the angular divergence of the H0 beam
in a stripping magnet using a steep magnetic ﬁeld gradient becomes smaller. Therefore, if the optics of the H− and
H0 beams is carefully designed, Lorentz stripping is considered to be suﬃciently useful, especially for higher energy
H− beams.

With respect to the stripping of H0 beams, we know that a beam of excited H0 atoms with a principal quantum
number of no less than 3 may be stripped by Lorentz stripping in the same manner as a H− beam [1]. H0 atoms
formed by Lorentz stripping from H− ions are left in the ground state. If H0 atoms of the beam can be excited to
a state with a principal quantum number of no less than 3 by laser pumping, a stripping scheme without foils will
be possible. Thus, a three-step stripping scheme was studied ﬁrst. The ﬁrst step is Lorentz stripping of a H− beam
to a H0 beam by a stripping magnet. The second step is pumping-up of the H0 beam to an excited state with the
principal quantum number being no less than 3, using a laser beam in a straight section of the ring. Finally, the third
step is again Lorentz stripping of the excited H0 beam by another stripping magnet. A variety of three-step stripping
schemes were reported [1, 7, 8]. The major diﬀerence of these schemes are in the second step, where we must take
care of the Doppler broadening of the transition frequency distribution due to the momentum spread of the H0 beam.
It was known from an early stage of studies on the laser stripping that there are two problems for the second step of
this scheme. One problem is that, since the transition frequency shifts by the Doppler eﬀect, the transition frequency

distribution spreads to as broad as 1013Hz, according to the momentum spread, ∆p/p, of the H0 beam, which is
typically 10−3. We denote the frequency by the angular frequency, ω ≡ 2πν , except when otherwise mentioned. The
line width of the laser should be narrower than 10 MHz in order to secure a coherence time necessary to cover the
ﬂight time of light from the laser source to the end of the interaction region, which is typically on the order of 10 ns.
Therefore, we need to take some measure to cover the spread of transition frequency as broad as 1013 Hz using a laser
beam having a line width as narrow as 10 MHz. The other problem is that if we do not take any measure, the rate
of H0 atoms that are excited in one collision between H0 and the laser beam is at most one half. This is because the
probability of the absorption and the stimulated emission of a photon by a H0 atom are the same, and the population
of the excited state saturates to one half. Therefore, in order to achieve an eﬃciency near to 100%, collisions between
the H0 beam and the laser must be repeated 4 or 5 times.

When H0 atoms are placed in an external electric ﬁeld, a potential barrier is formed due to the superposition of
the Coulomb potential of the proton and the external electric ﬁeld. The energy levels of the H0 atoms shift due
to the Stark eﬀect [9]. As the electric ﬁeld is increased, the peak energy of the potential barrier becomes lower.
And as the energy level comes near to the peak of the potential barrier, the lifetime of the energy level due to ﬁeld
ionization becomes shorter, and the level width becomes broader. Thus, the optical spectral lines fade out when the
ﬁeld ionization lifetime becomes comparable to the lifetime against radiation. However, the energy levels of the H0
atoms are well deﬁned at energies near to the peak of the eﬀective potential barrier [10]. The reciprocal lifetimes of
those energy levels become as high as 1012 ∼ 1013 sec−1 and, accordingly, the widths may be as broad as 1013 Hz
[11]. Broadening of the level width with an increase of the electric ﬁeld was experimentally observed using 800 MeV
H− beams at the Clinton P. Anderson Meson Physics Facility [12].

The widths of these levels are as broad as the spread of the transition-frequency distribution, due to the momentum
spread of the H0 beam, and are controllable by varying the external electric ﬁeld. Thus these levels were ﬁrst used as a
measure against the ﬁrst problem mentioned above. However, these broad levels soon also turned out to be helpful as
a measure against the second problem. Because excited H0 atoms ionize within a very short lifetime, the population
of excited H0 atoms cannot increase, and therefore pumping down to the ground state by stimulated emission is
negligible. Thus, the ionization eﬃciency is expected to be 100%. The level broadened by the Stark eﬀect as broad
as the spread of the transition-frequency distribution due to the momentum spread of the H0 beam is the essential
element of the stripping scheme described here. Therefore, for the sake of convenience, it is called the broad Stark
state.

II. DOPPLER SHIFT OF THE TRANSITION FREQUENCY

The frequency (ω) of laser in the laboratory frame is shifted to ω0 in the particle rest frame by the Doppler eﬀect,

and ω0 is given by

ω0 = γ (1 + β cos α) ω,

(1)

where β and γ are relativistic parameters of the particle, and α is the angle between the velocity of the particle and
the laser beam in the laboratory frame. Accordingly, the wavelength shifts with the kinetic energy of the H0 beam,
as shown in Fig. 1. In the particle rest frame of an H0 atom, the transition wavelength between the ground state and
the state with a principal quantum number 3 is 103nm, and a laser with this wavelength is in the ultraviolet region.
However, the transition wavelength is in the color region when the H0 beam energy becomes several hundreds MeV or
higher. Most of the beam energies of H− charge-exchange injection into high-intensity proton rings are in this energy
region. Generally speaking, lasers in the color region are easier to obtain and handle than those in the ultraviolet
region. This is a big advantage of the Doppler eﬀect.

Because the momentum spread of the H0 beam is the velocity spread of particles in the beam, the transition
frequencies of the individual particles spread due to the Doppler eﬀect. The spread of the transition-frequency
distribution in the particle rest frame (∆ω0) is given by

∆ω0 = ω0β

∆p
p (cid:19)

,

(cid:18)

(2)

where ω0 is the transition frequency in the particle rest frame and ∆p/p is the momentum spread of the H0 beam
in the laboratory frame. For example, when the momentum spread of a 1 GeV H0 atom is 10−3, as a typical value,
∆ω0 = 1.6 × 1013 Hz for the transition frequency between the ground state and the state with a principal quantum
number of 3.

III.

LASER STRIPPING VIA A BROAD STARK STATE

When a particle, with relativistic parameters of β and γ, moves in a magnetic ﬁeld B in the laboratory frame, the

particle is aﬀected in the particle rest frame by an electric ﬁeld (E) given by

E = βγcB.

(3)

This electric ﬁeld causes the particle to experience the Stark eﬀect. Therefore, by adjusting B so that the Stark
level comes near to the peak of the potential barrier, a broad Stark state can be formed. Combining such a broad
Stark state and laser pumping, a new type of H− charge-exchange injection system, like Fig. 2(a), becomes possible.
In this injection system, a H− beam is ﬁrstly converted to a H0 beam by a stripping magnet. Next, the H0 beam
is conducted into a magnetic ﬁeld of an undulator, where a broad Stark state of H0 atoms is prepared. Then, the H0
atoms are pumped up from the ground state to the prepared broad Stark state by a narrow-band laser beam. Excited
H0 atoms immediately dissociate and form a proton beam. Finally, the proton beam is captured by the ring.

The stripping process of this scheme is conceptually shown in Fig. 2(b). When H0 atoms come into the magnetic
ﬁeld of the undulator, the potential of the H0 atom is deformed to form a barrier by the electric ﬁeld of the Lorentz
force. The magnetic ﬁeld of the undulator is adjusted so that the aimed Stark state comes near to the peak of
the potential barrier, and is broadened as broad as the spread of the transition-frequency distribution due to the
momentum spread of the H0 beam. Because the level width of the state is suﬃciently broad, a narrow-band laser
with the same frequency as the central transition frequency can interact with all H0 atoms of the beam, although the
distribution of the transition frequency is very broad due to the momentum spread. Then, H0 atoms are pumped
up to the broad Stark state by a narrow-band laser. A narrow-band laser is necessary to secure the coherence time
that should cover the ﬂight time of light from the laser source to the end of the interaction region. Excited H0
atoms immediately ionize through auto-ionization, because the ionization probability of the state is far larger than
the probability of the stimulated emission of photons. Therefore, the rate of pumping down to the ground state is
negligible, and the reaction proceeds one-directionally from pumping up to auto-ionization. Competition between
pumping up and down does not occur. Thus, the stripping eﬃciency is expected to reach 100%. the ionization cross
section is given as a product of the cross section of the transition from the ground state to the excited state and the
ionization rate of the excited state. In this case, the ionization rate is almost one, because the ionization probability
of the excited state is very high and the ionization cross section is almost equal to the transition cross section.

FIG. 2: (a) New type of the H− charge-exchange injection system using an undulator and a laser pumping system. SM indicates
a stripping magnet. H0 atoms formed by SM drift into the magnetic ﬁeld of the undulator. Then, they are pumped up to a
broad Stark state and decay to a proton and an electron. (b) Conceptual drawing of the stripping process. An aimed Stark
state of H0 (here the state with n = 5) is broadened as much as the spread of the transition frequency due to the momentum
spread of the H0 beam by adjusting the undulator magnetic ﬁeld so that the aimed comes near to the peak of the eﬀective
potential barrier. Then, H0 atoms are pumped up to the broad Stark state by a narrow-band laser. Formed excited H0 atoms
immediately decay through autoionization.

We now estimate the parameters of the laser and the undulator necessary to realize a stripping system for a H0
beam. With respect to the Stark state of an H0 atom in an external electric ﬁeld, the variables describing the
quantum state are separated in parabolic coordinates [9]. An atomic state is completely deﬁned by a set of quantum
numbers (n, k1, k2, m). The quantum number n(m) is the principal (magnetic) quantum number, k1 is the quantum
number of a partial wave function in a partial potential that becomes inﬁnity at inﬁnite distance, and k2 is that in
a partial potential that has a barrier and becomes negative inﬁnity at inﬁnite distance. Also, there is the relation
n = k1 + k2 + |m| + 1.

The electric ﬁeld dependence of the energy level of the H0 atom Stark state with a set of quantum numbers

(n, k1, k2, m) is given by the following formula [9]:

where W is the energy in atomic unit (a. u.=27.21eV) and E is the strength of the external electric ﬁeld in atomic unit
(a. u.= 5.142 × 109V/cm). In Fig. 3, the dependence of the energy level upon the external electric ﬁeld is shown for
several states of n from 3 to 6 with k1 = 0, k2 = n − 1, and m = 0. Ec indicates the energy of the peak of the potential
barrier. Ec decreases with the electric ﬁeld strength. When Ec comes near a level, the decay probability of the level
due to the tunneling eﬀect increases and, accordingly, the level width broadens. As Ec approaches nearer, the level
width rapidly broadens. After Ec comes below the level, it ﬁnally disappears. Therefore, every line is terminated at
the point where the level width becomes 1013Hz. As shown in Fig. 3, the state with n = 5 or higher can be broadened
by as much as 1013Hz in an electric ﬁeld lower than 1MV/cm.

The level width is often denoted as the reciprocal lifetime or the ionization probability for a level near the peak of
the eﬀective potential barrier. The ionization probability Γ (in atomic unit) of a Stark level of a H0 atom is given by
the formula [13]

The ionization cross section for the combined action of a laser and an electric ﬁeld is given by σi = σknηi, where

where ωkn is the transition frequency. The coherence time of the laser is taken to be suﬃciently long to cover the
ﬂight time of light from the laser source to the end of the interaction region. However, H0 atoms see the laser as a
pulse of the length of the interaction time (τint/γ) in the particle rest frame. Therefore, the necessary energy density
of the laser is given by

We are now ready to derive a formula for the necessary laser power density in the laboratory frame. When the laser

and H0 beams collide at an angle α, the necessary energy density of the laser in the laboratory frame is given by

Before evaluating the laser power density, we must deﬁne which broad Star state is most suitable. By the selection
rule of the dipole transition, ∆m = 0 is allowed for a transition by a laser beam with π-polarization parallel to the
electric ﬁeld and ∆m = ±1 by that with σ-polarization. For a transition with ∆m = 0, the total transition matrix
element, or Ank in eq. (6), strongly depends upon k1 [14, 15]. For k1 of medium values, Ank decrease to many orders
of magnitude smaller than that for k1 near the extreme values: 0 or n − 1. In addition, the energy level with k1 = 0,
k2 = n − 1, and m = 0 is the lowest of the family of states with the same principal quantum number and accordingly
the transition energy is the lowest. Therefore, it seems to be most advantageous to utilize the broad Stark state with
n = 5, k1 = 0, k2 = 4, and m = 0. This state is broadened to 1.7 × 1013 Hz in an electric ﬁeld of 0.8 MV/cm. Under
this electric ﬁeld, the transition energy is shifted to 12.9 eV and, accordingly, the transition wavelength is 96.1 nm in
the particle rest frame.

Although there is no experimental data of the transition cross section in a MV/cm electric ﬁeld, some theoretical
calculations for the transition probability are reported [15, 16]. Here, we use the value 1.38 × 107 sec−1 for A1000,5040
given in the Atomic Data and Nuclear Data Table [16]. Substituting this value, ∆ωa = 1.7 × 1013 Hz and λ1000,5040 =
96.1nm into eq.( 6), the cross section is obtained as

Table I. shows a result of an evaluation of the relevant parameters for several energies of a H0 beam with the same
momentum spread of 0.1%, and for an interaction length of 30 cm. When the beam energy is 800 MeV, the necessary
laser wavelength is in the ultraviolet region. However, as the beam energy increases to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.0 GeV, the laser
wavelength changes to violet, blue and yellow. The necessary laser power density is about 4 kW/cm2, and a little
higher power density is necessary for a higher beam energy. The magnetic ﬁeld to cause the necessary Stark eﬀect is
below 2 kGauss.

IV.

LASER

With respect to the laser, a narrow-band CW laser is considered to be suitable, because the coherence time of the
laser must cover the ﬂight time of light between the laser source to the end of the interaction region, which may be
more than several tens of nano-seconds in an actual injection area of the proton ring. Furthermore, the duration of
the laser pulse must cover one injection period on the order of 1 msec, while H− beams are injected into the ring.

At present, the wavelengths of the available lasers are limited. Nd-YAG lasers seem to be the most available, and
also their performance is the most reliable. Those have a wavelength of 1,064 nm in the fundamental mode and 532
nm in the second harmonic. For the region near 400 nm, the second harmonic of a Ti-S laser may be useful. The
laser wavelength necessary for laser stripping depends on the energy of the H− beam. We should carefully choose a
laser that is reliable and easy to handle.

Nowadays, Fabry-Perot resonators (hereafter denoted as a FP resonator), which have a ﬁnesse as high as 105, are
realized in some ﬁelds of scientiﬁc research [17, 18]. Mirrors of such a FP resonator are made of a base material polished
to a sub-nanometer roughness and coated by carefully designed multiple layers. The loss rate per one reﬂection is on
the order of one ppm [19]. These FP resonators are able to stack a 10kW/cm2 laser beam with a diameter of 10 mm,
even when the mirror separation becomes as long as about 6 m. Although the wavelength of a laser that has been
actually applied for such a high-ﬁnesse FP resonator is limited to 1,064 nm, the fabrication technique is suﬃciently
applicable to shorter wavelengths.

The loss rate of photons by reﬂection and diﬀraction in one cycle of light in the resonator may be as low as on the
order of ppm in a high-ﬁnesse FP resonator. However, when we use such a FP resonator for laser stripping, additional
photon loss occurs accompanying the absorption of photons to excite H0 atoms to a broad Stark state. The loss rate
of photons increases with the intensity of the H0 beam to be stripped. However, the loss rate of photons must be
suppressed at a necessary level that depends on the intensity of the available original laser beam injected into the
FP resonator to secure the intensity of the laser beam stacked in the FP resonator. In the case of Table I, where all
H0 atoms of the beam are stripped, the laser beam ﬂux is about 4 kW/cm2 and the photon energy is about 3 eV.
Accordingly, when the diameter of the laser beam is 1cm, the photon intensity is 1 × 1022 photon/s. If the intensity
of the H0 beam is i mA, the photon loss due to absorption by the H0 beam occurs at 6.25i × 10−7. Therefore, when
the intensity of the source laser is a few hundreds mW, a laser beam with an intensity suﬃcient to strip an H0 beam
of about 100 mA is expected to be stacked in the FP resonator. Thus, a high-ﬁnesse FP resonator is considered to
be promising for application to a laser stripping system.

Using such a high-ﬁnesse FP resonator, the laser stripping system shown in Fig. 5 may be possible. The H0 and
laser beam stacked in the FP resonator collide at a small angle in order to secure the necessary interaction length.
An interaction region of about 30 cm long is placed in the central one of three magnets which compose an undulator.
The ﬁeld strength of the central magnet is set so as to cause H0 atoms to experience the necessary Stark eﬀect. The
magnetic ﬁeld strength of the outer magnets is set a little diﬀerent from that of the central one so that stripping does
not occur in these magnets. When the diameters of the H0 and laser beams are taken as 3 mm and 10 mm respectively,
the colliding angle is 20 mrad for the interaction length of 30 cm.Since the size of the beam duct is typically 10 cm,
the separation of two mirrors of the FP resonator becomes 6 m or longer. Thus, the FP resonator mentioned above
is considered suﬃciently applicable to this type of laser stripping system.

V. TUNABILITY OF LASER FREQUENCY AND UNDULATOR MAGNETIC FIELD

When we put a new method into actual use, it is very important to make clear in advance how to tune all of the
necessary parameters. In our case, the tunability of the laser frequency and the magnetic ﬁeld should be checked.
When the kinetic energy of a H0 atom is 1 GeV, the transition frequency of the Stark state with n = 5, k1 = 0,
k2 = 4, and m = 0 shifts and broadens with the magnetic ﬁeld as is shown in Fig. 6. From this ﬁgure, the operating
point is expected to be near to 1.9632 × 1016 Hz and 1.47 kGauss. However, we must probably search for the best
operating point, because not only the calculation, but also the caliblation of laser frequency and the magnetic ﬁeld,
often includes some errors. In this case, since the level width is as large as 1013 Hz near the operating point, such

a FP resonator. The H0 beam and the laser beam stacked between mirror 1 and mirror 2 collide in a small angle to secure a
necessary interaction length lint. The interaction region is placed in a magnetic ﬁeld B of the central magnet of an undulator
to cause H0 atoms necessary Stark eﬀect. The magnetic ﬁeld B’ of the outer magnets is set a little diﬀerent from B so that
stripping does not occur in these magnets.

a search procedure may be considered. The laser frequency of the FP resonator should be changeable in steps of a
few times 1012 Hz over a frequency range that well includes the operating point. The magnetic ﬁeld of the undulator
should be changeable by steps of 10 or 20 Gauss up to a suﬃciently high ﬁeld. Then, we scan the laser frequency and
the magnetic ﬁeld, while observing the yield of protons downstream of the interaction region. The peak of the proton
yield indicates the best operating point.

and laser beam collide in the magnetic ﬁeld of the central of the undulator magnet and accordingly stripping takes place there.
(Lower): Motion of the formed protons in the phase space. Protons formed by laser stripping at the point a through e in the
central magnet walk along respective dotted line from the origin to the point a through e int phase space while protons move
from the point they have been stripped to the end of the undulator magnet.

VI.

EMITTANCE GROWTH DUE TO STRIPPING IN THE UNDULATOR

Another important item to be checked is the emittance growth due to the stripping process. Here, we consider the
case where stripping takes place in the central magnet of the undulator, as is shown in Fig. 7(Upper). For the sake of
simplicity, the magnetic ﬁelds of the outer magnets are taken to be the same as that of the central magnet. Then, the
protons circulating in the ring take the orbit shown by the thick line. The maximum deﬂection (θ) and the maximum
displacement (d0) are given by the equations shown on the right side of the ﬁgure.

We consider that laser stripping occurs only in the central magnet. The motion of protons stripped at various
points of the magnet is shown in Fig. 7(Lower). While a proton stripped at point a in the central magnet moves
and reaches the end of the undulator, it walks along the dotted line from the origin, and reaches point a in phase
space. In the same manner, the protons formed at points b through e in the central magnet walk along the respective
dotted line from the origin to points b through e in phase space. Therefore, at the end of the undulator, protons just
formed by stripping distribute along the thick line in phase space. Thus, ptotons have a deﬂection spread of 2θ, and
a displacement spread of 2(d0 + θlm). For example, when 1 GeV H0 beams are stripped in an undulator magnet with
B = 0.148 T, lm = 15 cm and lg = 10 cm, θ and (d0 + θlm) are 3.92 mrad and 1.57 mm, respectively.

These spreads of the deﬂection and displacement increase the emittance of the formed proton beam by several
times the original emittance of the H0 beam which is typically 1 πmmmrad. However, such an emittance growth is
not considered to be very serious in a situation where we need to form a ring beam with an emittance larger than
100 πmmmrad by sophisticated phase-space painting. The emittance growth accompanying laser stripping should be
taken into account as a part of the phase-space painting.

VII. CONCLUSION

10

Resonant photo-ionization via a broad Stark state formed at energies near the peak of the eﬀective potential
barrier, called here laser stripping via a broad Stark state, turned out to be eﬀective not only to cover the spread
of the transition-frequency distribution due to the momentum spread of the H0 (or H−) beam, but also to avoid
saturation of the stripping eﬃciency to one half by the competition of pumping up and down. As a result, the
stripping eﬃciency is expected to reach 100%.

For a 1 GeV H0 beam, the magnetic ﬁeld necessary to broaden the Stark state of a H0 atom with n = 5, k1 = 0,
k2 = 4, and m = 0 as broad as 1013 Hz is estimated to be 1.45 kGauss, and the laser power density necessary to
complete stripping in an interaction length of 30 cm is estimated to be 4.15 kW/cm2. Today, high power FP resonators
are available which have ﬁnesses near 105 and lengths of 6m or longer, and are able to stack a 10 kW/cm2 light beam
with a diameter of 10 mm. These FP resonators are considered to be suﬃciently applicable for the laser stripping
systems installed in actual accelerators.

Because the level width of the Stark state is very broad, tuning of the laser frequency and the undulator magnetic
ﬁeld is rather easy. The emittance growth accompanying stripping in a magnetic ﬁeld is expected to be several times
the emittance of the H0 beam, but is insigniﬁcant in a situation where a ring beam with an emittance larger than
100 πmmmrad is formed from the H− beam by sophisticated phase-space painting. This emittance growth should be
taken into account as a part of beam painting.

Thus, a laser stripping system using a high-ﬁnesse Fabry-Perot resonator and an undulator magnet is considered
to be suﬃciently applicable to actual high-intensity proton rings as a substitute for the conventional injection system
using a solid foil.

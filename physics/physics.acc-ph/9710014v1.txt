High Energy Photon-Photon Colliders ∗

Abstract

Using the laser backscattering method at future TeV linear colliders one can
obtain γγ and γe colliding beams (photon colliders) with the energy and luminosity
comparable to that in e+e− collisions. Now this option is included to conceptual
designs of linear colliders. This paper (talk at the conference on nonlinear optics) is
a short introduction to this ﬁeld with an emphasis on required lasers which can be
γ conversion and for preparation of electron beams (photoguns,
used both for e
laser cooling), some interesting nonlinear QED eﬀects in a strong ﬁeld which apply
restrictions on parameters of photon colliders are discussed.

1 INTRODUCTION

It is well known that according to Maxwell’s equations electromagnetic waves in vacuum
cross each other without perturbations. Quantum electrodynamics predicts nonzero cross
section of photon–photon scattering (via box diagram with virtual e+e− pairs). However
for the optical photons this cross section is extremely small, about 10−63 cm2 growing
mec2). At high energies,photons can produced
very fast with the energy (
pairs of charged particles (e+e−, µµ, ...q ¯q, WW etc.) and other ﬁnal states.

Physics of elementary particles is studied in collisions of particles of various types: pp,
p¯p, ep, e+e−, etc..., which allows to produce new particles, investigate their properties,
structure and interaction. Photon collisions are also of great interest. Photons, as
electrons, are elementary particles (that is important for interpretation of results), cross
sections of new particle production in photon–photon collisions are of the same order

as that in e+e− collisions. Many phenomena of particle physics can be studied in γγ
collision in the best way. Generally speaking, physics in γγ collisions is complimentary
to that studied in other types of collisions. For example, e+e− annihilation goes via one
virtual photon and resonances with odd charged parity (the same as for photon) are
produced: ρ0, φ . . . Ψ, Υ, Z. While in γγ collisions resonances with even charged parity
are produced: π0, η . . . f, ηc, χ . . . H.

Since 1970, two-photon physics has been actively studied at e+e− storage rings. An
electromagnetic ﬁeld of a relativistic charged particle is transverse and can be treated
as equivalent photons. Approximately accuracy one can assume that each electron is
0.035
accompanied by almost real photon with the probability dnγ ∼
dω/ω. These experiments have given a lot of information on the nature of elementary
particles. For example, it was found that some of known C-even mesons have very small
cross sections in γγ collision that indicates that they have not quark-antiquark nature
(as usually) but more likely they consist of four quark or two gluons.

However, the γγ luminosity (number of events/second is proportional to luminosity)
in collisions of virtual photons at storage rings is much lower than e+e− luminosity and
concentrated mainly in the region of low invariant masses of γγ system. In the region
Wγγ/2E0 > 0.5 it accounts for only 0.02% of e+e− luminosity. Therefore, it is natural
that most of discoveries were done in e+e− collisions.

Maximum energy of e+e− storage ring is about 100 GeV (LEP-II at CERN with
circumference 27 km). Due to severe synchrotron radiation in storage rings the energy
region beyond LEP-II can be explored only with linear colliders. Such linear colliders
of 500 —1500 GeV center-of-mass energy are developed now in the main high energy
centers [1]. Some parameters of the linear colliders are presented in table 1. Parameters
of electron beams here are optimized for e+e− collisions. The luminosity (L) of colliders
given in the third line characterizes the rate of events and it is deﬁned as follows: the
number of events of a certain class per second ˙n = Lσ, where σ is the cross section of
N 2f /4πσxσy, where N is the number
the process. For cylindrical Gaussian beams L
of particles in the beam, σx, σy are transverse beam sizes, f is the collision rate.

≈

Linear colliders oﬀer unique, much more rich than before, opportunities to study γγ
and γe interactions. Unlike the situation in storage rings, in linear colliders each bunch
is used only once. This makes it possible to ”convert”electron to high energy photons
to obtain colliding γγ and γe beams [2, 3]. Among various method of γ
e conversion
the best one is Compton scattering of laser light on high energy electrons. The basic
scheme of a photon collider is the following, ﬁg.1. Two electron beams after the ﬁnal
focus system are traveling toward the interaction point (IP). At a distance of about
0.1–1 cm upstream from the IP, at the conversion point (C), the laser beam is focused
and Compton backscattered by electrons, resulting in the high energy beam of photons.
With reasonable laser parameters one can “convert” most of electrons into high energy
photons. The photon beam follows the original electron direction of motion with a small
angular spread of order 1/γ, arriving at the IP in a tight focus, where it collides with
the similar opposing high energy photon beam or with an electron beam. The photon

Two collision scheme were considered.

In the ﬁrst scheme there is no magnetic
deﬂection of spent electrons and all particles after the conversion region travel to the IP.
The conversion point may be situated very close to the IP. In the second scheme after
the conversion region particles pass through a region with a transverse magnetic ﬁeld
(B
0.5–1 T) where electrons are swept aside. Thereby one can achieve more or less
pure γγ or γe collisions.

In both schemes the removal of the disrupted spent beams (with very wide energy
spread, E = (0.02

scheme the electron bunches are tilted (using RF cavity) with respect to the direction of

the beam motion, and the luminosity is then the same as for head-on collisions. Due to
the collision angle αc ∼
30 mrad the outgoing disrupted beams travel outside the ﬁnal
quads.

The detailed description of photon colliders properties can be found in refs [3]–[7]
and in the Berkeley Workshop Proceedings [8]. Recently this option was included into
the Conceptual Design Reports of the NLC [9], TESLA–SBLC [10] and JLC. All these
linear collider projects foresee an interaction region for γγ,γe collisions.

Physical problems, which can be studied in γγ and γe collisions, were discussed in
hundred papers. Recent review of physics at photon colliders can be found, for example,
in TESLA/SBLC Conceptual Design Report [10].

These studies of possible physics and technical problems have shown that photon
colliders are quite realistic and can substantially add to a discovery potential of linear
colliders. Below is some list of arguments in favor of photon colliders.

•

•

Some phenomena can be studied at photon colliders better than anywhere, for
Higgs 1 width which is sensitive to all heavy
example: the measurement of γγ
charged particles (even with mc2 much larger than the collider energy); study of
the vertex γγWW.

→

Cross sections for the pair production of charged scalar, leptons and top in γγ col-
lisions are larger than those in e+e− collisions by a factor of 5; for WW production
this factor is even larger: 10–20.

In γe collisions charged supersymmetric particles with masses higher than in e+e−
collisions can be produced (heavy charged particle plus light neutral).

The luminosity of photon colliders (in the high energy part of luminosity spectrum)
with electron beam parameters considered in the present designs will be about
1033 cm−2s−1 or by a factor 5 smaller than Le+e−. But the absence of collisions
eﬀects at 0.1 – 1 TeV photon colliders allows to reach Lγγ up to 1035 cm−2s−1
using electron beams with very low emittances. High luminosity photon colliders
can provide much higher production rate of WW pair and other charged particles
than in e+e− collisions (see item 2) .

•

Obtaining of the ultimately high luminosities requires the development of new tech-
niques, such as the laser cooling of electron beams [12]. However, linear colliders
will appear (may be) only in one decade and will work next two decades. The
upgrading of the luminosity requires the injection part modiﬁcation only; it may

be a separate injector for a photon collider, merging of many low emittance RF-
photoguns (with or without laser cooling) is one of possible variants. Note that for
photon colliders positron beams are not required that simpliﬁes the task.

Development of X-ray FEL lasers based on linear colliders (which are now under
way) will favour the work on FEL required for photon colliders.

Summarizing we can say that physics goals for γγ,γe colliders are signiﬁcant and
complimentary to those in e+e− collisions; the technology (laser etc.) is suﬃciently
advanced and no more diﬃcult or risky than for e+e− colliders, there are no show–
stoppers; incremental cost is relatively small; therefore γγ,γe colliders should be
build.

nonlinear QED eﬀects important for photon colliders are discussed.

2 LASER PARAMETERS, CONVERSION EFFI-

CIENCY

The generation of high energy γ-quanta by the Compton scattering of the laser light on
relativistic electrons is well known method [5] and it has been used in many laboratories.
However, usually, the conversion eﬃciency of electron to photons k = Nγ/Ne is very
small, only about 10−7—10−5. At linear colliders, due to small bunch sizes one can focus
the laser more tightly to the electron beams and get k
1 at rather moderate laser ﬂash
energy.

∼

In the conversion region, a laser photon with an energy ω0 collides almost head-on
with a high energy electron of the energy E0. The energy of the scattered photon ω
depends on its angle ϑ with respect to the motion of the incident electron as follows [3]:

For 2E0 = 500 GeV it is about 1 µm, that is the region of the most powerful solid state
lasers. The energy spectrum of the scattered photons for x = 4.8 is shown in ﬁg. 3 for
various helicities of the electron and laser beams (here λe is the mean electron helicity
1/2), Pc is the helicity of laser photons. We see that with the polarized beams

softer in general and populate the low energy part of the spectrum. If a laser light is

polarized, high energy photons are also polarized. Corresponding curves can be found
elsewhere [4, 7]. The polarization is very advantageous for many experiments.

The spectrum of scattered photons is very broad, but because of energy-angle
correlation in the Compton scattering it is possible to obtain rather narrow distributions
of the spectral luminosities in γγ and γe collisions. Spectral luminosity distributions
depend on the variable ρ = b/γa, where b is the distance between the conversion region
and the interaction point (i.p.), a is the r.m.s. radius of the electron beam at the i.p..

collisions electrons collide only with the highest energy photons, therefore the invariant
mass spectrum of γe collision is narrow. In γγ collisions at ρ
1 the photons with higher
energy collide at smaller spot size and, therefore, contribute more to the luminosity. As
a result, the luminosity spectrum is much narrower than at ρ
1. In ﬁg. 4 the plots
of spectral γγ luminosities are shown in collisions of round beams at a low conversion
coeﬃcient. The cases of unpolarized and polarized beams(2Pcλe =
1 both beams) for
ρ = 0 and 1 are presented [7]. One can see that at ρ = 1 the luminosity in the low mass
region is strongly suppressed and the full width at half of maximum is about 10% for
polarized and 20% for unpolarized beams. In realistic cases one should take into account
photons from the multiple Compton scattering and emitted by electrons in the strong
ﬁeld of the opposing beam (so called “beamstrahlung”), examples of realistic luminosity
distribution can be found elsewhere [7, 10].

A laser ﬂash energy required for obtaining conversion eﬃciency close to 100% can
easily be estimated using well known characteristics of a laser beam with diﬀraction
divergence. The emittance of the Gaussian laser bunch with diﬀraction divergence is
ǫx,y = λ/4π. The r.m.s. spot size of a laser beam at the focus (i = x, y) [3], σL,i(0) =
λZR/4π, where ZR is known as the Rayleigh length. The r.m.s. transverse size of a

laser near the conversion region depends on a distance z to the focus (along the beam) as
σL,x(z) = σL,x(0)
R. We see that 2ZR is the eﬀective length of the conversion

Note, that the required ﬂash energy decreases with reducing the Rayleigh length down to
σz, and it is hardly changed with further decrease in ZR. This is because the density of
photons grows but the length having a high density decreases and the Compton scattering
probability remains almost the same. It is not helpful to make the radius of the laser
λσz/4π, which may be much larger than the
beam at the focus smaller than σL,x ∼ q
transverse electron bunch size at the conversion region.

Above we have considered only the geometrical properties of the laser beam and the
pure Compton eﬀect. However, in the strong electromagnetic ﬁeld at the laser focus,
multiphoton eﬀects (non-linear QED) are important. Nonlinear eﬀects are described by
the parameter [11]

1 an electron
scatters on many laser photons simultaneously (synchrotron radiation in a wiggler). The
transverse motion of an electron in the electromagnetic wave leads to an eﬀective increase
in the electron mass: m2
m2(1 + ξ2), and the maximum energy of scattered photons
decreases: ωm = x/(1 + x + ξ2). At x = 4.8, the value of ωm/E0 decreases by 10% at
ξ2 = 0.6. Although this can be compensated by some increase in x, but, in any case,
large ξ2 leads to smearing of the high energy Compton peak. The value of ξ2
1 can
be considered as the limit.

→

∼

Recently [12], it was found how to avoid this problem.

The nonlinear QED eﬀects are more important for projects with shorter bunches and
higher beam energies (larger λ) and makes problems already for some current projects [6,
7]. In principle, in order to avoid this problem one can make the laser target of less dense
but longer (to keep the conversion coeﬃcient constant). But in this case, the required
ﬂash energy should be larger than that deduced from the diﬀraction consideration only.
In the suggested scheme
the focus depth is stretched without changing the radius of this area. In this case, the
collision probability remains the same but the maximum value of the ﬁeld is smaller. The
solution is based on use of chirped laser pulses [14] (wave length is linearly depends on
longitudinal position) and chromaticity of the focusing system. In the proposed scheme,
the laser target consists of many laser focal points (continuously) and light comes to
each point exactly at the moment when the electron bunch is there. One can consider
that a short electron bunch collides on its way sequentially with many short light pulses
le. The required ﬂash energy in the scheme
of length lγ ∼
with a stretched laser focus is determined only by diﬀraction and at the optimum wave
length does not depend on the collider energy.

3.1 Solid state lasers

In the last ten years the technique of short powerful lasers made an impressive step and
has reached petowatt (1015) power levels and few femtosecond durations [13]. Obtaining

8

few joule pulses of picosecond duration is not a problem. For photon collider applications
the main problem is a high repetition rate. This is connected with overheating of the
amplifying media.

The success in obtaining picosecond pulses is connected with a chirped pulse ampliﬁ-
cation (CPA) technique [14]. The principle of CPA is the following. A short, low energy
pulse is generated in an oscillator. Then this pulse is stretched by a factor about 104 in
the grating pair which has delay proportional to the frequency. This long nanosecond
pulse is ampliﬁed and compressed by another grating pair to a pulse with the initial or
somewhat longer duration. Due to practical absence of non-linear eﬀects for the stretched
pulses, the obtained pulses have a very good quality close to the diﬀraction limit.

One of such lasers [15] works now in the E-144 experiment studying nonlinear QED
eﬀects in the collision of laser photons and 50 GeV electrons. It has a repetition rate
of 0.5 Hz, λ = 1.06 µm (Nd:Glass), 2J ﬂash energy, 2 TW power and 1 ps duration.
This is a top-table laser with ﬂash lamp pumping. Its parameters are very close to our
needs, only the repetition rate is too low. Further progress in the repetition rate (by two
orders) is possible with a diode pumping (high eﬃciency semiconductor lasers). With
diode pumping the eﬃciency of solid state lasers reaches a 10% level. Recent studies [15,
16, 9] have shown that the combination of CPA, diode pumping, zig-zag slab ampliﬁer,
recombining of several lasers (using polarizers and Pockel cells or slightly diﬀerent wave
lengths), and other laser techniques (if necessary) such as phase-conjugated mirrors,
moving ampliﬁers allows already now to build a solid state laser system for a photon
collider. All necessary technologies are developing actively now for other applications.

3.2 Free Electron Lasers

Free electron lasers (FEL) are very attractive for gamma-gamma collider. Indeed, FEL
radiation is tunable and has always minimal (i.e. diﬀraction) dispersion. The FEL
radiation is completely polarized: circularly or linearly for the case of helical or planar
undulator, respectively. The problem of synchronization of the laser and electron bunches
at the conversion region is solved by means of conventional methods used in accelerator
techniques. A FEL ampliﬁer has potential to provide high conversion eﬃciency of the
kinetic energy of an electron beam into coherent radiation, up to 10%. At suﬃcient peak
power of the driving electron beam the peak power of the FEL radiation could reach
the required TW level. A short review of activities on FEL for photon colliders and
references can be found elsewhere [10].

4 Optics at the interaction region

The possible layout of optics near the IP is shown in ﬁg. 5 [10]. The conversion region
1.5γσy = 0.5–1.5 cm from the IP. Beams collideat the IP
is situated at a distance b
at the crab-crossing angle 30 mrad (see ﬁg. 2). The distance between IP and ﬁnal quad

∼

is about 2 m. All the optics is situated inside a tungsten conical mask which absorbs
particle from showers on mirrors and quads. Arguments for chosing this geometry and
estimation of mirror resistance are given in ref. [10].

5 LASER COOLING

To attain high luminosity, beams in linear colliders should be very tiny. At the interaction
point (IP) in the current LC designs [1], beams with transverse sizes as low as σx/σy
200/4 nm are planned. Beams for e+e− collisions should be ﬂat in order to reduce
∼
beamstrahlung energy loss (synchrotron radiation in the ﬁeld of the opposing beam).
For γγ collision, the beamstrahlung radiation is absent and beams with smaller σx can
be used to obtain higher luminosity.

The transverse beam sizes are determined by the emittances ǫx, and ǫy. The beam
sizes at the interaction point (IP) are σi = √ǫi βi , where βi is the beta function at
the IP (analog of the Rayleigh length in optics) which should be of the order of the
electron bunch length. With the increase in the beam energy the emittance of the bunch
decreases: ǫi = ǫni/γ, where γ = E/mc2, ǫni is the normalized emittance.

The beams with a small ǫni are usually prepared in damping rings which naturally
ǫnx. Laser RF photoguns can also produce beams with low

produce bunches with ǫny ≪
emittances. However, for linear colliders it is desirable to have smaller emittances.

Recently [12], a new method was considered — laser cooling of electron beams —
which allows, in principle, to obtain the electron beam with cross sections by about two
orders smaller than attainable with other methods.

10

The idea of laser cooling of electron beams is very simple. During a collision with
optical laser photons (in the case of strong ﬁeld it is more appropriate to consider the
interaction of an electron with an electromagnetic wave) the transverse distribution of
electrons (σi) remains almost the same. Also, the angular spread (σ′
i) is almost constant,
because for photon energies (a few eV) much lower than the electron beam energy (several
GeV) the scattered photons follow the initial electron trajectory with a small additional
spread. So, the emittance ǫi = σiσ′
i remains almost unchanged. At the same time,
the electron energy decreases from E0 down to E. This means that the transverse
normalized emittances have decreased: ǫn = γǫ = ǫn0(E/E0). One can reaccelerate the
electron beam up to the initial energy and repeat the procedure. Then after N stages of
cooling ǫn/ǫn0 = (E/E0)N (if ǫn is far from its limit).

∼

Some possible sets of parameters for the laser cooling are: E0 = 4.5 GeV, le = 0.2 mm,
λ = 0.5 µm, ﬂash energy A
10 J. The ﬁnal electron bunch will have an energy of 0.45
GeV with an energy spread σE/E
13%, the normalized emittances ǫnx,ǫny are reduced
by a factor 10. A two stage system with the same parameters gives 100 times reduction

of emittances. The limit on the ﬁnal emittance is ǫnx ∼
10−6
comparison, in the TESLA (NLC) project the damping rings have ǫnx = 14(3)
10−8 m rad. The electron beam after laser cooling accelerated to
m rad, ǫny = 25(3)
one TeV energy can be focused to a spot with about 0.5 nm diameter.

For obtaining ultimate emittances the parameter ξ2 in the cooling region should be
less than one (Compton scattering) [12]. This is also necessary for preserving the electron
polarization. These conditions can be achieved using the method of laser focus stretching
described in sect.2.

Laser cooling requires a laser system even more powerful than that for e

γ con-
version. However, all the requirements are reasonable taking into account fast progress
of laser technique and time plans of linear colliders. A multiple use of the laser bunch
can reduce considerably an average laser power.

→

Using laser cooling one can attain in γγ collisions the luminosity by one order higher
than that in e+e− collisions [17, 18]. Besides, the typical cross section in the γγ collisions
are larger by a factor of ﬁve. Both these facts are very good arguments in favor of photon
colliders.

6 MAXIMUM ENERGY AND LUMINOSITY OF

PHOTON COLLIDERS

Cross sections of “interesting” physical processes (such as charged pair production) de-
crease usually with energy as 1/E2
cm, where Ecm is the center-of-mass energy of colliding
particles, therefore the luminosity of colliders should grow proportionally to E2
cm. A
reasonable scaling for the required γγ luminosity at γγ collider is

Lγγ ∼

3

×

1033E2

cm cm−2s−1,

(7)

11

where Ecm is in TeV unit. In e+e− collisions characteristic cross sections are somewhat
smaller and a required luminosity is larger by a factor of 5.

In linear colliders, each bunch is used only once, its production and acceleration
requires a certain power. It means that the number of accelerated particle can not be
increased with energy. In current projects a power consumption is already 100–200 MW.
The only way to increase the luminosity is a decrease in transverse beam sizes at the
interaction point.

In e+e− collision, the minimum beam sizes are determined by strong radiation of
particles in the ﬁeld of the opposing beam (beamstrahlung) and beam–beam instability.
These eﬀects impose strong restrictions on beam parameters and determine the attain-
able luminosity in e+e− collisions. In table 1 one can see that all projects use the ﬂat
beams, vertical size is of the order of 3–20 nm and horizontal size is larger by a factor of
100. This is because for the same beam cross section the electromagnetic ﬁeld is reverse
proportional to the largest transverse size.

6.1 Restrictions due to coherent pair creation

At the ﬁrst sight, in γγ collisions both beams are neutral and collision eﬀects should be
absent. It is not a case. The conversion point is situated very close to the interaction
point (IP), and electrons after conversion pass the IP very close to the axis and inﬂuence
on the oncoming photons and electrons.

What happens with photons? First of all, a photon can be converted into e+e−
pair in a collision with an individual electron (Bethe-Heitler process — incoherent pair
10−26 cm2. The
creation). The cross section of this process at high energies is about 4
characteristic luminosity in one bunch collision is about 1030 cm−2s−1 therefore as much
as 104 e+e− pairs will be produced per one bunch collisions (these pairs move in forward
direction and do not cause serious background in detector). Note, that this process does
not destroy the beam containing about 1010 photons.

×

More important for photon colliders is the process of coherent pair creation (conver-
sion of a photon into e+e− pair in the collective ﬁeld of an opposing electron beam) [19, 6,
7, 17]. This process becomes important for the beam ﬁelds B (

the critical ﬁeld, re = e2/mc2 is the classical radius of electron, ω is the photon energy.
The origin of this condition is the following. In the rest system of the virtual e+e− pair

B. If the energy
acquired by e+ and e− in this ﬁeld on the Compton wave length λc = ¯h/mc is larger than
mc2 then a virtual particle may become a real one. That is a spontaneous pair creation

The coherent pair creation can impose restriction on the value of attainable luminos-
ity. Fortunately, at an energy below about one TeV (which is a goal of the next linear

12

colliders) this eﬀect is considerably suppressed due to repulsion of electron beams dur-
ing collisions. Even inﬁnitely narrow electron beams after repulsion at the IP create an
acceptable ﬁeld on the axis, which does not cause catastrophic loss of the γγ luminosity.
Some simulation results of the attainable γγ luminosity are shown in ﬁg. 6[17]. It
was assumed that the conversion point is situated as close as possible to the IP at a
distance b = 3σz + 0.04E[TeV] cm. The second number is equal to the minimum length
of the conversion region posed by nonlinear QED eﬀects. The vertical electron beam size
was taken smaller than b/γ, the horizontal size was varied. The total beam power was
kept equal to 15Ecm[TeV] MW. In ﬁg. 6 one can see that, if the collision eﬀects are not

Figure 6: Dependence of the γγ luminosity on the horizontal beam size for σz = 0.2 mm,
see comments in the text.

important, the luminosity curves follow their natural behavior L
1/σx. This is valid
for all curves at large horizontal beam sizes (low beam ﬁelds). At low σx some curves
make zigzag or change slope, this is due to the conversion of photons into e+e− pairs.

∝

These results lead us to following conclusions. For the energies Ecm < 2 TeV, which
are in reach of the next generation of linear colliders, the luminosity limit is much higher

13

than that required by our scaling for luminosity given by eq. 7. The energy limit for
photon colliders is about Ecm ∼

5–10 TeV.

6.2 Depolarization of photons in a strong beam ﬁeld

.

It is well known that the region with a strong electromagnetic ﬁeld can be treated as
an anisotropic medium with some refraction index [11]. In fact, the conversion of photons
to e+e− pairs (absorption) considered in the previous section is the manifestation of the
imaginary part of the refraction index. The values n are diﬀerent for photons with
linear polarization parallel (n1) and perpendicular (n2) to the ﬁeld direction. Similar to
the behaviour of optical photons in anisotropic crystals an electromagnetic ﬁeld in the
vacuum can change a photon polarization. Such an eﬀect was considered before for high
energy photons traveling in a strong ﬁeld between crystal planes [20]. A similar eﬀect (but
not in constant ﬁeld) is possible in the conversion region at photon colliders where the
high energy photon polarization can change due to interaction with high density optical
photons in the laser focus [21]. Here we will consider the new eﬀect at photon colliders –
an inﬂuence of the ﬁeld of the opposite electron beam on the polarization of high energy
photons. A detailed consideration of this eﬀect will be published elsewhere [22], here
only main results are presented.

We see that the beam ﬁeld is an isotropic medium with diﬀerent refraction indeces
for linear polarization parallel and perpendicular to the beam direction. Such a medium
transforms the circular γ quanta polarization of into the linear polarization and vice
versa. In addition, due to the diﬀerence in the absorption length the total polarization
decreases. Using eqs. 8,11 one can obtain the decrease in circular polarization λγ during
the beam collision (it is assumed that the initial polarization was 100%)

κ from eqs. 11,12 we can ﬁnd ∆λγ/λγ as a function of γ/σz for diﬀerent We+e−, it is
shown in ﬁg. 8a. For low γ/σz and large We+e− the depolarization is unacceptably high.
The e+e− pair creation is the only one eﬀect restricting the γγ luminosity. In prin-
ciple, it may happen that photons lose their polarization at the luminosity much lower
than its limit posed by the pair creation. To check this we plotted in ﬁg. 8b the values of
κ as a function of the same parameters as those in ﬁg. 8a. In order to decrease ∆λγ/λγ
at ﬁxed γ/σz we have to decrease We+e− (see ﬁg. 8a) which can be done, for example,
by increasing the horizontal beam size σx. This corresponds to some decrease in κ (see
ﬁg. 8b). Now we can estimate the luminosity loss in this procedure. The luminosity is

e−W . Looking at ﬁg. 8b one can ﬁnd that the retention of
L
depolarization below 1% is accompanied by a very small loss of luminosity (compared to
the maximum one), it is less than 20% in the whole region of parameters. This is very
good. Note, however, that so simple adjustments of polarization loss by varying the hor-
izontal beam size σx is not always possible. In the case where the initial electron beams
are very narrow and the pair creation is suppressed only due to the beam repulsion (as it
was discussed in the previous section) we will get some value of κ which is not controlled
by the focusing of the electron beams. If depolarization degree is not acceptable it is
necessary to adjust the number of particles in the beam and its length.

So, the analysis of depolarization phenomena at photon colliders connected with the
anisotropy of the refraction index in the collision region with a strong electromagnetic
ﬁeld shows that this eﬀect is essential in some cases and should be taken into account. By
proper measures one can keep the depolarization below few percents without noticiable
loss of the γγ luminosity.

7 Conclusion

Future linear colliders oﬀer unique opportunities to study particle physics in γγ and γe
interactions. Such photon colliders at an energy 0.1 – 1 TeV are being developed now

16

in the main high energy centers. Hopefully, in 15–20 years this will be one of the main
areas of particle physics.

Diﬀerential Transfer Relations of Physical Flux Density
Between Time Domains of the Flux Source and Observer

Ji Luo∗
Accelerator Center, Institute of High Energy Physics, Beijing, China
(Dated: February 2, 2008)

Diﬀerential transfer relations of ﬂux density, general physics quantities’ and its corresponding
energy’s, between time domains of source and observer are derived from conservative rule of various
physical quantities and time function between the two domains. In addition, integrated form of the
relations are inferred and examples of potential application are illustrated and discussed.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Observing whole physical transportation process of a speciﬁed micro ﬂux increment from being emitted to detected
during a pair of corresponding time intervals on time domains of source and observer respectively, a fundamental fact
can be realized that both variations of physical quantity due to possible loss or energy exchange in the process and
transportational time for diﬀerent ﬂux signals within the micro ﬂow element can contribute detected ﬂux density at
observing location signiﬁcantly. Physical quantity, here divided into two main categories — general physics quantity
such as phase of waves, mass, charge and particles’ number and micro system’s energy carried by the micro ﬂow
element consisted of a kind of or a compound of general physics quantities like a micro multi-charged particle system,
contributes the detectable ﬂux density in two ways; for negative contribution, some quantity of the micro ﬂow which
originated from source might be lost in the transportational process and fails to reach the observer; for energy exchange
related contribution to energy ﬂux density at observer, an amount of energy originated in external system joins or
adds to the micro system’s energy for the system’s energy gain till to reach the observer, whereas it is converse for
the system’s energy release. Meanwhile a variation of the ﬂux signal’s transportation time will result in a variation
of time interval in which the ﬂux element is received by observer with respect to the time interval of the ﬂux element
emission at source, so that it aﬀects detecting ﬂux density with time factor. In addition, a variation of longitudinal
length of the micro ﬂux element along its moving direction, as a particular physics quantity, exists in the process and
accompanied with their physical quantity’s diﬀerential transfer relation simultaneously. By combining conservative
rule of physical quantity with a knowledge of time function between time domains of signal source and observer [1],
we will set up the three diﬀerential transfer relations which are accompanied or combined for any kind of physics ﬂux
between time domains of ﬂux source and observer, and present integral form of the diﬀerential transfer relations, their
basic properties and their potentially important application in a few cases.

II. DERIVATION OF THE DIFFERENTIAL TRANSFER RELATIONS, BASIC PROPERTIES AND
INFERENCE

A. Derivation of the Three Diﬀerential Transfer Relations

For any micro continuous ﬂow consisted of a kind of physical quantity from source to observer, there are three
essential diﬀerential transfer relations accompanied with the transportation process simultaneously; they are the
micro ﬂux increment themselves, corresponding longitudinal length of the micro ﬂow and energy ﬂux, therefore the
three transfer relations must share same time related characteristics or time relations.

Speciﬁcally there is the transportation process as following:
A micro ﬂux increment ∆Q( ˙t) is released from instants t − ∆t to t, then pass through the space between source
and observer during transfer time T (t − ∆t) and T (t) for head and tail of the micro ﬂow element respectively, and
ﬁnally are detected at observing location from instant t′ − ∆t′ = t − ∆t + T (t − ∆t) to instant t′ = t + T (t) [1], here
˙t ∈ [t, t + T (t)]. Consequently the diﬀerential transfer relations can be derived below.

2. Transfer Relation of Longitudinal Length of the micro ﬂow along moving direction

As a particular physics ﬂux, the length can be either compressed or elongated. So except that the micro length
∆ℓ( ˙t) could be increased or lengthened whereas the general micro increment ∆Q( ˙t) can only be decreased in general
due to ∆Ql( ˙t), it has same transfer relations as general physics ﬂux has.

Any change on the physical quantity in the micro increment, longitudinal length, energy carried by ∆Q(t′) and

physical or diﬀerential state inside of the micro ﬂux element occurs simultaneously and is inner related.

According to the electromagnetic wave energy ﬂux relation, observer’s measuring or measured optical intensity not
only has been determined by optical energy’s spatial diminishing factor related with T (t), but also depend upon time
function’s factor which is determined by a rate of signal transfer time. From equation (19), it’s known that time
function’s eﬀect must be considered in frequency-shift relevant measures and data analysis.

This means that the number of particles in the micro element will diminish as they are accelerated.
However, according to the number’s ﬂux diﬀerential transfer relation

at observing location instantaneous number ﬂux can exceed the emitting number ﬂux due to time function related
factor when dT (t

Furthermore, as to rf accelerator T (t) or T (t′) is periodic function with a designated τ ∗, T (t + τ ∗) = T (t) and
T (t′ + τ ∗) = T (t′); hence on diﬀerent time domains along higher energy of the micro ﬂux increment, there will be ever
increasing high frequency fractional factor in a Fourier analysis on number ﬂux, charge ﬂux, mass ﬂux and energy ﬂux,
although number of the particles, and corresponding mass and charge of the speciﬁc micro increment will decrease
continuously in the transportation process.

According to equation (8) the carried energy of the micro increment, ∆E( ˙t), can be progressively increased by

with equation (24), we can make an inference that the energy gain ∆E(t′) − ∆E(t) can not be stored as or converted
into any mass of the micro element for ∆M (t′)−∆M (t) 6 0. Then where has been the energy gain stored in the micro
ﬂux increment? We will ﬁnd it stored as internal electrical potential energy in the micro increment, and partially
converted to the mass center’s kinetic energy of the micro increment [2].

B. Potential Application

A. By means of phase transfer function (Ref. Eqs. 19, 20), the phase function on observer time domain at measuring
location of wave interference region can be transformed to phase source time domain on which the angular
frequency or velocity is known. Then phase diﬀerence on observer time domain is expressed by term of time
function and known or designated parameter of phase source [3].

B. Energy ﬂux analysis on frequency-shift astronomical measurement [4].

C. As an analytic approach one longitudinal properties, energy exchange and ﬂux of charged particles in accelera-

tion [2].

IV. CONCLUSION

The diﬀerential transfer relations of general physics ﬂux between time domains of source and observer, accompanied
with a longitudinal length’s transfer relation, and corresponding energy ﬂux occur or exist simultaneously; and they
reﬂect diﬀerent aspect of a speciﬁed ﬂux increment’s transportation process between source and observer. Time
function factor could signiﬁcantly aﬀect the values of corresponding ﬂuxes on two time domains and itself or rate of
it is a necessary fraction of the transfer relations. The diﬀerential transfer relations are set up on conversation of
various physics quantities independently and shared time transfer relation. Based on the diﬀerential transfer relation
of ﬂux, its integral form — physical quantity transfer function between the time domains is inferred.

MULTISCALE ANALYSIS OF RMS ENVELOPE DYNAMICS

A. Fedorova, M. Zeitlin, IPME, RAS, St. Petersburg, V.O. Bolshoj pr., 61, 199178, Russia ∗†

Abstract

We present applications of variational – wavelet approach
to different forms of nonlinear (rational) rms envelope
equations. We have the representation for beam bunch os-
cillations as a multiresolution (multiscales) expansion in
the base of compactly supported wavelet bases.

1

INTRODUCTION

In this paper we consider the applications of a new nume-
rical-analytical technique which is based on the methods
of local nonlinear harmonic analysis or wavelet analysis to
the nonlinear root-mean-square (rms) envelope dynamics
[1]. Such approach may be useful in all models in which it
is possible and reasonable to reduce all complicated prob-
lems related with statistical distributions to the problems
described by systems of nonlinear ordinary/partial differ-
ential equations.
In this paper we consider an approach
based on the second moments of the distribution functions
for the calculation of evolution of rms envelope of a beam.
The rms envelope equations are the most useful for analy-
sis of the beam self–forces (space–charge) effects and also
allow to consider both transverse and longitudinal dynam-
ics of space-charge-dominated relativistic high–brightness
axisymmetric/asymmetric beams, which under short laser
pulse–driven radio-frequency photoinjectors have fast tran-
sition from nonrelativistic to relativistic regime [1]. Anal-
ysis of halo growth in beams, appeared as result of bunch
oscillations in the particle-core model, also are based on
three-dimensional envelope equations [2]. From the for-
mal point of view we may consider rms envelope equations
after straightforward transformations to standard Cauchy
form as a system of nonlinear differential equations which
are not more than rational (in dynamical variables). Be-
cause of rational type of nonlinearities we need to con-
sider some extension of our results from [3]-[10], which are
based on application of wavelet analysis technique to vari-
ational formulation of initial nonlinear problems. Wavelet
analysis is a relatively novel set of mathematical methods,
which gives us a possibility to work with well-localized
bases in functional spaces and give for the general type of
operators (differential, integral, pseudodifferential) in such
bases the maximum sparse forms. Our approach in this
paper is based on the generalization [11] of variational-
wavelet approach from [3]-[10], which allows us to con-
sider not only polynomial but rational type of nonlineari-
ties.

Our representation for solution has the following form

z(t) = zslow

N (t) + Xj≥N

zj(ωjt), ωj ∼ 2j

(1)

N

which corresponds to the full multiresolution expansion in
all time scales. Formula (1) gives us expansion into a slow
and fast oscillating parts for arbitrary N. So, we
part zslow
may move from coarse scales of resolution to the ﬁnest one
for obtaining more detailed information about our dynami-
cal process. The ﬁrst term in the RHS of equation (1) corre-
sponds on the global level of function space decomposition
to resolution space and the second one to detail space. In
this way we give contribution to our full solution from each
scale of resolution or each time scale. The same is correct
for the contribution to power spectral density (energy spec-
trum): we can take into account contributions from each
level/scale of resolution. In part 2 we describe the different
forms of rms equations. In part 3 we present explicit ana-
lytical construction for solutions of rms equations from part
2, which are based on our variational formulation of ini-
tial dynamical problems and on multiresolution represen-
tation [11]. We give explicit representation for all dynami-
cal variables in the base of compactly supported wavelets.
Our solutions are parametrized by solutions of a number
of reduced algebraical problems from which one is nonlin-
ear with the same degree of nonlinearity and the rest are
the linear problems which correspond to particular method
of calculation of scalar products of functions from wavelet
bases and their derivatives.

2 RMS EQUATIONS

Below we consider a number of different forms of RMS en-
velope equations, which are from the formal point of view
not more than nonlinear differential equations with ratio-
nal nonlinearities and variable coefﬁcients. Let f (x1, x2)
be the distribution function which gives full information
about noninteracting ensemble of beam particles regard-
ing to trace space or transverse phase coordinates (x1, x2).
Then we may extract the ﬁrst nontrivial bit of ‘dynamical
information’ from the second moments

x1 = < x2

x,rms =< x2

We will consider the following particular cases of rms
envelope equations, which described evolution of the mo-
ments (1) ([1],[2] for full designation):
for asymmetric
beams we have the system of two envelope equations of
the second order for σx1 and σx2:

and have arbitrary dependence of time. Because of time di-
lation we can consider only next time interval: 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.
Let us consider a set of functions

Φi(t) = xi

(Qiyi) + Piyi

and a set of functionals

Fi(x) = Z 1

where yi(t) (yi(0) = 0) are dual (variational) variables. It
is obvious that the initial system and the system

I/(I0(σx1 + σx2 )γ 3) + ε2

The envelope equation for an axisymmetric beam is a par-
ticular case of preceding equations.

Also we have related Lawson’s equation for evolution
of the rms envelope in the paraxial limit, which governs
evolution of cylindrical symmetric envelope under external
linear focusing channel of strenghts Kr:

where Kr ≡ −Fr/rβ2γmc2,
According [2] we have the following form for envelope
equations in the model of halo formation by bunch oscil-
lations:

β ≡ νb/c = p1 − γ−2

Fi(x) = 0

(9)

are equivalent. Of course, we consider such Qi(x) which
do not lead to the singular problem with Qi(x), when t = 0
or t = 1, i.e. Qi(x(0)), Qi(x(1)) 6= ∞.

Now we consider formal expansions for xi, yi:

xi(t) = xi(0) +Xk

λk
i ϕk(t)

yj(t) = Xr

ηr
j ϕr(t), (10)

where ϕk(t) are useful basis functions of some functional
space (L2, Lp, Sobolev, etc) corresponding to concrete
problem and because of initial conditions we need only
ϕk(0) = 0, r = 1, ..., N,

i = 1, ..., n,

λ = {λi} = {λr

i } = (λ1

i , λ2

i , ..., λN

where the lower index i corresponds to expansion of dy-
namical variable with index i, i.e. xi and the upper index
r corresponds to the numbers of terms in the expansion of
dynamical variables in the formal series. Then we put (10)
into the functional equations (9) and as result we have the
following reduced algebraical system of equations on the
set of unknown coefﬁcients λk

i of expansions (10):

(5)

where X(s), Y(s), Z(s) are bunch envelopes, ξx, ξy, ξz =
F (X, Y, Z).

After transformations to Cauchy form we can see that all
this equations from the formal point of view are not more
than ordinary differential equations with rational nonlin-
earities and variable coefﬁcients (also,b we may consider
regimes in which γ, γ′ are not ﬁxed functions/constants but
satisfy some additional differential constraint/equations,
but this case does not change our general approach).

3 RATIONAL DYNAMICS

Our problems may be formulated as the systems of ordi-
nary differential equations

Qi(x)

dxi
dt

= Pi(x, t),

x = (x1, ..., xn),

(6)

i = 1, ..., n, max

i

deg Pi = p, max

i

deg Qi = q

with ﬁxed initial conditions xi(0), where Pi, Qi are not
more than polynomial functions of dynamical variables xj

L(Qij, λ, αI ) = M (Pij , λ, βJ ),

(12)

where operators L and M are algebraization of RHS and
LHS of initial problem (6), where λ (11) are unknowns of
reduced system of algebraical equations (RSAE)(12).

Qij are coefﬁcients (with possible time dependence) of
LHS of initial system of differential equations (6) and as
consequence are coefﬁcients of RSAE.

Pij are coefﬁcients (with possible time dependence) of
RHS of initial system of differential equations (6) and as
consequence are coefﬁcients of RSAE. I = (i1, ..., iq+2),
J = (j1, ..., jp+1) are multiindexes, by which are labelled
αI and βI — other coefﬁcients of RSAE (12):

βJ = {βj1...jp+1} = Z Y1≤jk≤p+1

ϕjk ,

(13)

where p is the degree of polinomial operator P (6)

αI = {αi1 ...αiq+2 } = Xi1,...,iq+2

Z ϕi1 ... ˙ϕis ...ϕiq+2 ,

(14)

where q is the degree of polynomial operator Q (6), iℓ =
(1, ..., q + 2),

˙ϕis = dϕis /dt.

Now, when we solve RSAE (12) and determine unknown
coefﬁcients from formal expansion (10) we therefore ob-
tain the solution of our initial problem. It should be noted
if we consider only truncated expansion (10) with N terms
then we have from (12) the system of N × n algebraical
equations with degree ℓ = max{p, q} and the degree of
this algebraical system coincides with degree of initial dif-
ferential system. So, we have the solution of the initial
nonlinear (rational) problem in the form

where coefﬁcients λk
i are roots of the corresponding re-
duced algebraical (polynomial) problem RSAE (12). Con-
sequently, we have a parametrization of solution of initial
problem by solution of reduced algebraical problem (12).
The ﬁrst main problem is a problem of computations of
coefﬁcients αI (14), βJ (13) of reduced algebraical sys-
tem. These problems may be explicitly solved in wavelet
approach. The obtained solutions are given in the form
k are roots
(15), where Xk(t) are basis functions and λi
of reduced system of equations.
In our case Xk(t) are
obtained via multiresolution expansions and represented
by compactly supported wavelets and λi
k are the roots of
corresponding general polynomial system (12). Our con-
structions are based on multiresolution approach. Because
afﬁne group of translation and dilations is inside the ap-
proach, this method resembles the action of a microscope.
We have contribution to ﬁnal result from each scale of res-
olution from the whole inﬁnite scale of spaces. More ex-
actly, the closed subspace Vj (j ∈ Z) corresponds to level
j of resolution, or to scale j. We consider a multiresolution
analysis of L2(Rn) (of course, we may consider any dif-
ferent functional space) which is a sequence of increasing
closed subspaces Vj: ...V−2 ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ ...
satisfying the following properties:

\j∈Z

Vj = 0, [j∈Z

Vj = L2(Rn),

So, on Fig.1 we present contributions to bunch oscillations
from ﬁrst 5 scales or levels of resolution. It should be noted
that such representations (1), (15) for solutions of equa-
tions (3)-(5) give the best possible localization properties
in corresponding phase space. This is especially important
because our dynamical variables corresponds to moments
of ensemble of beam particles.

In contrast with different approaches formulae (1), (15)
do not use perturbation technique or linearization proce-
dures and represent bunch oscillations via generalized non-
linear localized eigenmodes expansion.

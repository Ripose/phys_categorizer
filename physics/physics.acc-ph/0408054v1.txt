The Israeli Tandem Electrostatic Accelerator FEL (EA-FEL), which is based on an electrostatic Van der Graaﬀ
accelerator was relocated to Ariel 3 years ago, and has now returned to operation under a new conﬁguration.
In the present FEL, the millimeter-wave radiation generated in the resonator is separated from the electron
beam by means of a perforated Talbot eﬀect reﬂector. A quasi-optic delivery system transmits the out-coupled
power through a window in the pressurized gas accelerator tank into the measurement room (in the previous
conﬁguration, radiation was transmitted through the accelerator tubes with 40 dB attenuation). This makes it
possible to transmit useful power out of the accelerator and into the user laboratories.

After re-conﬁguring the FEL electron gun and the e-beam transport optics and installing a two stage depressed
collector, the e-beam current was raised to 2 A. This recently enabled us to measure both spontaneous and
stimulated emissions of radiation in the newly conﬁgured FEL for the ﬁrst time. The radiation at the W-band
was measured and characterized. The results match the predictions of our earlier theoretical modeling and
calculations.

1. Introduction

The Israeli electrostatic accelerator FEL (EA-
FEL) is based on a 6 MeV EN-Tandem Van de
Graaﬀ accelerator, which was originally used as
an ion accelerator for nuclear physics experiments
[1]. The scheme employs straight geometry for
the electron beam transport, where the electron
gun and the collector are installed outside of the
accelerator region. Lasing was reported in a pre-
vious conﬁguration, where radiation was trans-
mitted through the accelerator tubes with 40dB
attenuation [2,3].

In the present version of the FEL, which was
relocated to Ariel, the millimeter-wave radiation
generated in the resonator is separated from the
electron beam by means of a perforated Talbot
eﬀect reﬂector [4,5]. A quasi-optic delivery sys-
tem transmits the out-coupled power through a
window in the pressurized gas accelerator tank.
The basic parameters of the FEL are summarized
in Table 1. The acceleration voltage is set to be

Ek = 1.4 M eV in order to tune the frequency of
the FEL radiation to the W-band near 100 GHz.
In the following sections, we present an analy-
sis and the results of spontaneous and stimulated
emissions measurements carried out recently.

2. Spontaneous emission in a resonator

Random electron distribution in the e-beam
causes ﬂuctuations in current density, identiﬁed
as shot noise in the beam current. Electrons pass-
ing through a magnetic undulator emit a partially
coherent radiation, which is called undulator syn-
chrotron radiation. The electromagnetic ﬁelds ex-
cited by each electron add incoherently, resulting
in a spontaneous emission with generated power

imately 2/τsp = 2(f0/NW ). In a FEL, utilizing a

2πf µ0/kz is the mode impedance, and

I0 is the DC beam current. The expected value
of the total spontaneous emission power gener-
ated inside the cavity is about Psp(LW )/I0 =
60 µW A−1. The calculated spectrum of the spon-
taneous emission power of the Israeli EA-FEL,
has a null-to-null bandwidth of 18 GHz.

At the resonator output, the spontaneous emis-
sion spectrum generated inside the resonator
is modiﬁed by a Fabry-Perot spectral transfer-
function [7]:

The maxima of the resonator transfer function
factor occur when kz(fm)
Lc = 2mπ (where
m is an integer), which deﬁnes the resonant fre-
quencies fm of the longitudinal modes. The free-
spectral range (FSR) (the inter-mode frequency
separation) is given by FSR = vg/Lc
113 MHz.

the power emitted from the resonator out-coupler
is reduced to P out
24 µW. The attenua-
tion of the wave-guiding system, delivering the
power from the resonator, located inside the high-
voltage terminal, to the measurement apparatus
is 10dB. Consequently, the spontaneous emission
power expected at the detector sight is 2.4 µW.
The traces shown in Fig. 2, describe the electron
beam current pulse and the signal obtained at
the detector video output, corresponding to the
measured spontaneous emission RF power.

In the present operation regime of the FEL, the
eﬃciency of energy extraction from the electron
beam is given in terms of the number of wiggler’s
periods Nw by the approximate formula ηext
≈
1/2NW = 2.5 %. The stimulated radiation power
generated inside the resonator at steady state is
given as follows:

and evaluated to be Pout = 7 kW. Consider-
ing the attenuation of the transmission system,
700 W is expected at the detector. Fig. 3 shows
recent measurement of 150 W radiation power
at the end of the optical transmission line in the
measurement room. We note that in the present
preliminary experiments, only a fraction of the
cathode current was transported through the
wiggler, and no beam circulation (transport up
to the collector) was achieved. The charging of
the terminal caused voltage drop of the terminal
of 125 kV during the pulse duration. Evidently,
the FEL had not yet reached saturation because
the radiation mode built inside the resonator
went out of synchronism with the beam before
reaching saturation.

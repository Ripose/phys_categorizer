INTRODUCTION

In this paper we consider the applications of numerical-
analytical approach based on multiscale variational wavelet
technique to the systems with collective type behaviour de-
scribed by some forms of Vlasov-Poisson/Maxwell equa-
tions [1], [2]. Such approach may be useful in all mod-
els in which it is possible and reasonable to reduce all
complicated problems related with statistical distributions
to the problems described by the systems of nonlinear or-
dinary/partial differential/integral equations with or with-
out some (functional) constraints.
In periodic accelera-
tors and transport systems at the high beam currents and
charge densities the effects of the intense self-ﬁelds, which
are produced by the beam space charge and currents, de-
terminine (possible) equilibrium states, stability and trans-
port properties according to underlying nonlinear dynamics
[2]. The dynamics of such space-charge dominated high
brightness beam systems can provide the understanding of
the instability phenomena such as emittance growth, mis-
match, halo formation related to the complicated behaviour
of underlying hidden nonlinear modes outside of perturba-
tive tori-like KAM regions. Our analysis is based on the
variational-wavelet approach from [3]-[17], which allows
us to consider polynomial and rational type of nonlinear-

where s(x − xji) is a shape function of distributing par-
ticles on the grids in conﬁguration space, are replaced by
powerful technique from local nonlinear harmonic analy-
sis, based on underlying symmetries of functional space
such as afﬁne or more general. The solution has the mul-
tiscale/multiresolution decomposition via nonlinear high-
localized eigenmodes, which corresponds to the full mul-
tiresolution expansion in all underlying time/phase space
scales. Starting from Vlasov-Poisson equations in part 2,
we consider the approach based on multiscale variational-
wavelet formulation in part 3. We give the explicit repre-
sentation for all dynamical variables in the base of com-
pactly supported wavelets or nonlinear eigenmodes. Our
solutions are parametrized by solutions of a number of re-
duced algebraical problems one from which is nonlinear
with the same degree of nonlinearity as initial problem and
the others are the linear problems which correspond to the
particular method of calculations inside concrete wavelet
scheme. Because our approach started from variational for-
mulation we can control evolution of instability on the pure
algebraical level of reduced algebraical system of equa-
tions. This helps to control stability/unstability scenario
of evolution in parameter space on pure algebraical level.
In all these models numerical modeling demonstrates the
appearance of coherent high-localized structures and as a
result the stable patterns formation or unstable chaotic be-
haviour.

Analysis based on the non-linear Vlasov equations leads
to more clear understanding of collective effects and non-
linear beam dynamics of high intensity beam propagation
in periodic-focusing and uniform-focusing transport sys-
tems. We consider the following form of equations (ref.

3 MULTISCALE REPRESENTATIONS

We obtain our multiscale/multiresolution representations
for solutions of equations (3)-(8) via variational-wavelet
approach. We decompose the solutions as

fb(s, x, y, px, py) =

⊕δif (s, x, y, px, py)

(9)

∞

Xi=ic

ψ(s, x, y) =

⊕δjψ(s, x, y)

(10)

x(s) =

⊕δkx(s),

y(s) =

⊕δℓy(s)

(11)

∞

Xℓ=ℓc

where set (ic, jc, kc, ℓc) corresponds to the coarsest level
of resolution c in the full multiresolution decomposition

Vc ⊂ Vc+1 ⊂ Vc+2 ⊂ . . .

Introducing detail space Wj as the orthonormal comple-
Wj, we

In some sense (9)-(11) is some generalization of the old
δF approach [1], [2]. Let L be an arbitrary (non) line-
ar differential/integral operator with matrix dimension d,
which acts on some set of functions Ψ ≡ Ψ(s, x) =
, s, x ∈ Ω ⊂ Rn+1 from L2(Ω):

Ψ1(s, x), . . . , Ψd(s, x)

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

LΨ ≡ L(R(s, x), s, x)Ψ(s, x) = 0,

(14)

(x are the generalized space coordinates or phase space co-
ordinates, s is “time” coordinate). After some anzatzes [3]-
[17] the main reduced problem may be formulated as the
system of ordinary differential equations

dfi

or a set of such systems corresponding to each indepen-
dent coordinate in phase space. They have the ﬁxed initial
(or boundary) conditions fi(0), where Pi, Qi are not more
than polynomial functions of dynamical variables fj and
have arbitrary dependence on time. As result we have the
following reduced algebraical system of equations on the
set of unknown coefﬁcients λk
i of localized eigenmode ex-
pansion (formula (17) below):

L(Qij, λ, αI ) = M (Pij , λ, βJ ),

(16)

where operators L and M are algebraization of RHS and
LHS of initial problem (15) and λ are unknowns of re-
duced system of algebraical equations (RSAE) (16). Af-
ter solution of RSAE (16) we determine the coefﬁcients
of wavelet expansion and therefore obtain the solution of
our initial problem. It should be noted that if we consider
only truncated expansion with N terms then we have from
(16) the system of N × n algebraical equations with degree
ℓ = max{p, q} and the degree of this algebraical system
coincides with degree of initial differential system. So, we
have the solution of the initial nonlinear (rational) problem
in the form

fi(s) = fi(0) +

λk
i fk(s),

(17)

N

Xk=1

where coefﬁcients λk
i are the roots of the corresponding re-
duced algebraical (polynomial) problem RSAE (16). Con-
sequently, we have a parametrization of solution of ini-
tial problem by the solution of reduced algebraical prob-
lem (16). The obtained solutions are given in the form
(17), where fk(t) are basis functions obtained via multires-
olution expansions (9)-(11), (13) and represented by some
compactly supported wavelets. As a result the solution of
equations (3)-(8) has the following multiscale/multireso-
lution decomposition via nonlinear high-localized eigen-
modes, which corresponds to the full multiresolution ex-
pansion in all underlying scales (13) starting from coars-
est one (polynomial tensor bases are introduced in [17];
x = (x, y, px, py)):

Ψ(s, x) =

Formula (18) gives us expansion into the slow part Ψslow
N,M
and fast oscillating parts for arbitrary N, M. So, we may
move from coarse scales of resolution to the ﬁnest one
for obtaining more detailed information about our dynam-
ical process. The ﬁrst terms in the RHS of formulae (18)
correspond on the global level of function space decom-
position to resolution space and the second ones to detail
It should be noted that such representations give
space.

ent approaches formulae (18) do not use perturbation tech-
nique or linearization procedures. So, by using wavelet
bases with their good (phase) space/time localization prop-
erties we can describe high-localized (coherent) structures
in spatially-extended stochastic systems with collective be-
haviour. Modelling demonstrates the appearance of stable
patterns formation from high-localized coherent structures
or chaotic behaviour. On Fig. 1 we present contribution
to the full expansion from coarsest level (waveleton) of

of KAM region. We can control the type of behaviour on
the level of reduced algebraical system (16).

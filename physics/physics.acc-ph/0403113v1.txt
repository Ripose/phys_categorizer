In this paper we present the nonlinear quantum theory of X-Ray FEL in a wiggler. We present
the solution of the Dirac equation in a space periodic strong magnetic ﬁeld, which describes the
quantum dynamics of a single electron in a wiggler. With the help of obtained wave function of an
electron the self-consistent set of the Maxwell and relativistic quantum kinetic equations is obtained.
Then, the process of coherent X-ray radiation generation in nonlinear quantum regime, when the
photon energy is larger than resonance widths due to energetic/angular spreads of an electron beam
and resonance width caused by ﬁnite interaction length, is investigated.

I. INTRODUCTION

∼

Many types of stimulated radiation sources have been suggested over the years to achieve lasing in shortwave
domain. A promising way for realization of X-ray laser is connected with the version of free electron laser (FEL)
[1]. The main advantage of FEL lies in the fact that the emission frequency is continuously Doppler upshifted by
γ2
several orders (
L, γL being Lorenz factor) with respect to the frequency of the pump ﬁeld. In particular, the X-ray
FEL schemes have been proposed based on the coherent accumulation of ultrarelativistic electron beam radiation
in undulator and at Compton-backscattering, channeling, transition and diﬀraction radiations [2]. At the present,
however, among these versions the undulator scheme is actually developed and the ﬁrst lasing has been carried out
in this system [3]. Although the amplifying frequencies are still far from X-ray, the main hopes for an eﬃcient X-ray
FEL remain connected with the undulator scheme. The absence of the normal-incidence mirrors of high reﬂectivity
at the short wavelengths in order of X-ray practically excepts a resonator scheme of radiation generation. In this case
it is necessary to implement a single pass high gain FEL. The most attractive scheme, which is presently considered,
is the Self Ampliﬁed Spontaneous Emission [4], where the spontaneous undulator radiation from the ﬁrst part of an
undulator is used as an input signal to the downstream part. For this purpose two international projects [5] TESLA
and LCLS being currently implemented.

In the more conventional undulator devices to achieve X-ray frequencies domain one should increase the electrons

energies up to several GeV , which in turn signiﬁcantly reduces the small-signal gain (

In contrast with conventional laser devices on atomic systems FEL is usually reckoned as a classical device. But this
is not universal property of FEL as in some cases the quantum eﬀects may play signiﬁcant role, especially for X-ray
frequencies. In the quantum description [6], the resonant momenta of an electron for the emission pe and absorption
pa are diﬀerent due to a quantum recoil. The probability distributions of emission and absorption are centered at pe
and pa respectively and when these distributions much narrower than the spread of electron beam distributions f (p),
f (pa). In the quasiclassical limit
the small-signal gain is proportional to the so called ”population inversion” f (pe)

where ∆εγ, ∆εϑ, are the resonance widths due to energetic and angular spreads, and ∆εL resonance width caused by
ﬁnite interaction length the quantum expression for the gain coincides with its classical counterpart being antisym-
metric about the classical resonant momentum pc=(pe + pa)/2 and proportional to the derivative of the momentum
distribution function df (p)/dp at p = pc. Resulting gain takes place only if the initial momentum distribution is
centered above pc as the electrons whose momenta are above pc contribute on average to the small-signal gain, and
those whose momenta are below pc contribute on average to the corresponding loss. This severely limits the FEL gain
performance at short wavelengths.

The eﬃciency of FEL at short wavelengths can be signiﬁcantly increased in the quantum regime of generation:

In this case the absorption and emission lineshapes are separated and the simultaneous absorption of probe wave is
excluded. To achieve the condition (1.2) for FEL operation is problematic as it presumes severe restrictions on the
beam spreads. In any case, it may be satisﬁed at the emission of hard X-ray quanta.

In this work the scheme of X-ray coherent radiation generation in nonlinear quantum regime by means of relativistic
high density electron beam in wiggler is investigated. The possibility to achieve quantum regime of FEL at high
harmonics of Doppler-shifted ”wiggler frequencies” is treated. The consideration is based on the self-consistent set
of the Maxwell and relativistic quantum kinetic equations. Because of nonequdistantness of the energy-momentum
levels the probe wave resonantly couples only two electrons states in wiggler and the coupled equations are solved in
the slow varying envelope approximation.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section II we obtain the wave function of an electron in a wiggler. Section
III describes our model with the self-consistent set of equations. The particular solutions of self-consistent set of
equations for the X-ray generation are discussed in Sec. IV. Finally, conclusions are given in Sec. V.

II. WAVE FUNCTION OF AN ELECTRON IN A WIGGLER

For the quantum description of FEL dynamics we will need the wave function of an electron in a wiggler. We will
consider as linear (LW) as well as helical Wigglers (HW). Here and in what follows for the four-component vectors
we have chosen the following metrics a

aµ = (a0, a) and ax is the relativistic scalar product:

To describe the magnetic ﬁeld of a Wiggler we will choose the following four-vector potential

where

x = (ct, r) is the four-component radius vector and

with the Wiggler step-ℓ. In (2.2) g =

The dynamics of an electron in Wiggler can be described by the Dirac equation, which in the quadratic form [7],

Eq. (2.4) in the form

where p = (ε/c, p) is the four-momentum of a free Dirac particle.

To solve Eq. (2.4) we will consider f (τ ) as a slowly varying bispinor function of τ (in the scale of pk0/(~k2

0) and
neglect the second derivative compared with the ﬁrst order (see condition (2.10)). So from (2.4) and (2.7) for f (τ )
we will have the following equation:

function [7]. The main diﬀerence in this case is that k2

III. SELF-CONSISTENT SET OF THE MAXWELL AND RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM KINETIC

probe electromagnetic (EM) wave in a Wiggler.

IV. STEADY-STATE REGIMES OF AMPLIFICATION

Our goal is to determine the conditions under which we will have non-linear ampliﬁcation. We will assume steady-
state operation, according to which will drop with partial time derivatives in (3.32). The considered setup is either a
single-pass ampliﬁer, for which it is necessary injected input signal or self-ampliﬁed coherent spontaneous emission,
for which it is necessary initially modulated beam.

Besides we will consider the case of exact resonance neglecting detuning in Eqs. (3.32) assuming that electron
beam momentum distribution is centered at ∆e = 0. To achieve maximal Doppler-shift and optimal conditions of
ampliﬁcation we will assume that electron beam propagates along undulator axis (Z axis).
In this case optimal
condition for LW is θ = 0, while for HW θ
K/γL (θ << 1). For both cases we will assume that the envelope of
probe wave depends only on z . Then the set of equations (3.32) and conservation laws (3.33, 3.34) are reduced to

We will consider two regimes of ampliﬁcation, which are determined by initial conditions. For the ﬁrst regime the
initial macroscopic transition current of the electron beam is zero and it is necessary to have an seeding electromagnetic
wave. In this case the following boundary conditions are imposed

where dn (z, κ) is the Elliptic function of Jacobi and κ its module.

As is known dn (z, κ) is the periodic function with the period 2Ξ(κ) , where Ξ(κ) is the Complete Elliptic Integral
Ξ(κ)/σ (r = 0, 1, 2...) the wave intensity reaches its maximal value

of ﬁrst order. At the distances L = (2r + 1)κ

and the wave gain is rather small. To extract maximal energy from electron beam the interaction length should be at
Ξ(κ)/σ. At this condition the intensity value
least order of half of spatial period of the wave envelope variation- κ
Imax = I0 + N ~ωvz is achieved, because all electrons make contribution in radiation ﬁeld. Taking into account that

Let us now consider the other regime of wave ampliﬁcation when electron beam is modulated- ”macroscopic transition
current” J diﬀers from zero. This regime can operate without any initial seeding power (I0 = 0). So we will consider
the optimal case with the following initial conditions

Then the wave intensity is expressed by the formula

V. DISCUSSION

The coherent interaction time of electrons with probe radiation is conﬁned by the several relaxation processes. To be
more precise in the self consistent set of equations (3.32) we should add the terms describing spontaneous transitions
and other relaxation processes. Since we have not taken into account the relaxation processes, this consideration is
correct only for the distances L
cτmin, where τmin is the minimum of all relaxation times. Due to spontaneous
radiation electron will lose the energy

In the Tables 1, 2 we give the parameters for the diﬀerent setups of a beam and undulator as for LW as well as
for HW. The beam current have been chosen 5kA and the beam radius 10−3cm. Maximum intensity Imax scales as
W/cm2. As we see from these tables for the high harmonics Lc is decreased and simultaneously
∼
~ω/ε is increased, but Ls < Lc. In this case wiggler tapering is necessary to keep the resonance condition. But how
it will look like for quantum regime will be the subject of the future work.

inﬂuence upon this regime as it is governed by the initial current and only Doppler dephasing and spontaneous
lifetime may interrupt the superradiation process. Note, that necessary for this regime quantum modulation of the
particle beams at the above optical frequencies can be obtained through multiphoton transitions in the laser ﬁeld at
the presence of a ”third body”. The possibilities of quantum modulation at hard X-ray frequencies in the induced
Compton, undulator and Cherenkov processes have been studied in the works [9].

Abstract

In the framework of the Low Emittance Gun (LEG) project, high gradient ac-
celeration of a low emittance electron beam will be necessary. In order to achieve
this acceleration a -500 kV, 250 ns FWHM, pulse will be applied in between two
electrodes. Those electrodes should sustain the pulsed ﬁeld without arcing, must
not outgass and must not emit electrons. Ion back bombardment, and dark current
will be damageable to the electron source as well as for the low emittance beam.
Electrodes of commercially available OFE copper, aluminium, stainless steel, tita-
nium and molybdenum were tested following diﬀerent procedures including plasma
glow discharge cleaning.

1 Introduction

In the framework of the Low Emittance Gun (LEG) project, an X-ray free-electron laser
based on a ﬁeld emitting cathode is expected to deliver six orders of magnitude higher
peak brightness than current state-of-the-art light sources, and thus with a thousand
times shorter pulses [1, 2].

To quickly accelerate the electrons emitted by the electron source, and keep the emit-
tance low, a stable pulsed voltage in the megavolt range is needed. The ﬁrst project phase
is to design and test an ultra high vacuum (UHV) 500 kV pulser using a resonant air-core
transformer (Tesla coil) [3]. A pulse of 250 ns (full width at half maximum), -500 kV,
working at 10Hz, will be applied between the cathode holder and an extracting anode.
During this time, electrodes material should sustain the ﬁeld without arcing and the dark
current should be kept as low as possible. This dark current will ionize the residual gas as
well as desorbing neutral and ions by the known electron stimulated desorption process
(ESD) [4, 5]. Those ions will be accelerated toward the cathode and the ﬁeld emitter

array (FEA), aka the electron source, and induce sputtering. It is known that very low
energy ions, 500 eV, do sputter diﬀerently diﬀerent surfaces and already produce mea-
surable damages [6, 7, 8]. The damages induced, from any kind of energetic ions, will
then reduce the electron emission and the lifetime of the ﬁeld emitter, as it is the case
for AsGa photocathodes, for example, used as polarized electron source for accelerators
[9, 10]. During the after pulse, the reversed ﬁeld will accelerate the ions toward the ex-
tracting anodes producing a current of electrons which will also back bombard the ﬁeld
emitter. The gas desorbed can induced a pressure bump which might not disappear before
the next pulse, giving room to build a dangerous plasma, which could in a worse case lead
to breakdown and sputtering of the anode material to the ﬁeld emitter cathode. Recent
work, and thorough review over a century of vacuum breakdown research, in many areas,
[11, 12, 13] is still not enough to choose blindly the electrodes of choice.

In order to investigate the electrodes material, a DC high gradient test stand was
built to test diﬀerent metals susceptible to be used as electrodes in the pulser. The goal
is to ﬁnd the most suitable material, for our needs, which can sustain high ﬁeld without
breakdown, and does emit almost no electron. In situ cleaning by plasma glow discharge
was also tested to see whether an improvement was noticeable in the mitigation of the
dark current. This technique of gas conditioning to lower the ﬁeld enhancement factor
β has already been reported [14, 15, 16] and used successfully in accelerators to process
niobium accelerating cavities, see description in [12], as well as for curing other issues [17].

2 System setup and electrodes preparation

2.1 System setup

The ultra-high vacuum (UHV) system shown on Fig.1, outside its metal conﬁnement
bunker for radiological protection, is pumped by a 150 l/s diode ion pump. The average
pressure reached is in the low 10−9 Torr scale after a quick bake of the ion pump. A more
thorough bake brings the pressure in the mid 10−10 Torr. An injection line, a leak valve
and a Torr capacitance gauge allow the controlled injection of diﬀerent gas in the system
to prepare the glow discharge in between the electrodes.

Figure 1: Dark Current -100 kV DC test stand. The ﬂat cathode is mounted on the left
side of the system.

2

A negative and continuous 0 to 100 kV bias is applied to the cathode through an insu-
lating ceramic, left side of the picture (Fig.1). The anode is grounded. The capacitance of
the system is closed to 300 pF, hence an energy potentially stored of 1.5 J at 100 kV. The
current ﬂowing from the cathode to the anode is measured across a 1 MΩ resistor with
a digital FlukeTM voltmeter. The gap separation between the electrodes are adjustable
via a translation feedthrough and controlled with a mechanical comparator. The sagging
due to the weight at the end of the rods makes that the two electrodes are not centered
on each other. We do not expect this oﬀ centering to be of any consequences on the
high voltage processing. However, it explains the oﬀ center damages seen on cathodes.
Accurate measurement of the current to the 50 pA level is achieved.

2.2 Electrodes’ choice

Due to the long history of research on vacuum breakdown, it seems that the choice of the
electrodes should be easy. However, as there is no universal quantifying theory to explain
the process of vacuum breakdown depending on the material, its surface state (physical
and chemical), it is necessary to do our own test for our own application. In order to pick
the most appropriate material, one choose to look at some elements properties. Many
tables of elements are then compiled in order to make an educated choice. In our case, our
electrodes should sustain a DC pulse of 500 kV and not produce or have a low electron
dark current. Also as a FEA will be installed in the middle of the cathode, if any arcing
occurs sputtered, or vaporized, anode material will deposit on the FEA. This can lead
to the death of the FEA, and the necessity to exchange it; with all the trouble that it
implies. We have then look at elements, cf Table.1, comparing the secondary electron
yield (SEY) the sputtering rate, the melting point, and the tensile modulus.

[6] and self-sputtering rate at 500 eV of diﬀerent elements [19, 20].

From Table.1, some of the bad candidate could be Cu and Au. Result obtained with
RF waveguide support this point [22]. Despite its good electronic and ionic properties
Al should be discarded as the combination of melting point and elastic modulus is low,
compare to other materials. Al will probably coat thoroughly a FEA in case of arcing,
as it happened in a setup with a FEA and a gold coated anode. That implies that spark

3

processing to reach high gradient, despite being eﬃcient, should be avoided [23, 24],
or used with an adequate procedure. Some of the other material which look good in
this table, would be probably discarded in regards to their yield strength versus the
temperature or their electrical or thermal conductivity. Also the choice of the cathode
and anode should be made separately as one good cathode material might not be as well
adapted as an anode. All being decided by the geometry of the system, and by evacuation,
eventually, of the heat generated by the dark current.

2.3 Electrodes preparation and testing

All our electrodes tested have the same shape, see Fig.2 & 3 for the cathode and anode,
respectively. The mean roughness was, by design, deﬁned to be less than Ra ≤ 0.2µm.
On the anodes picture, Fig.3), the copper anode, has a hole in the middle. This hole was
made to mimic the behaviour of the extracting anode of the 500 kV pulser. None of the
other electrodes have this hole. The Ra of the electrodes was checked after high gradient
testing.

Figure 2: Cleaned Cu cathode after high voltage testing, left. Damaged Mo cathode, right
picture Damages can be clearly seen.

The electrodes were cleaned by use of acetone and alcohol in an ultra-sonic bath,
before installation in the UHV system. Unless speciﬁed otherwise none of the surfaces
have been mirror ﬁnished. All materials were commercially obtained from GoodfellowTM.
Technical materials refer to commercially available material, which is exposed to air before
installation.

Ti and Mo electrodes were obtained from the same machining company. Electrodes
were thoroughly cleaned in acetone and alcohol before use. Ti electrodes were installed
as it, and Mo electrodes were vacuum ﬁred at 900◦C for 3 h, during that time. After
Mo testing, Ti electrodes were also vacuum ﬁred and reused. From the literature, it was
shown that heating up the material is beneﬁcial in improving the breakdown strength
[25].

ﬁring), Mo in the center and Cu on the right. Pictures taken after HV testing. Damages
can be seen on the Ti electrodes

The processing history followed by the material tested are summarized in Table.2.
The procedure of high gradient conditioning is the same for all the cathodes. The voltage
between the electrodes is applied for a given gap, 4 mm, 3 mm, 2 mm, 1.5 mm and
then 1 mm. The voltage is raised slowly, waiting for stable condition, by discreetness
steps, to 60 kV and then the gap is closed with a reduce voltage equal to the previously
obtained static electrical ﬁeld. It was found that above 70 kV arcing sometime happened
somewhere else in the system.

During conditioning, soft breakdowns might occur. During those breakdowns, current
is measured and the pressure can increase by a factor 10. When observed, the voltage is,
usually, manually reduced. The pressure recovers in a minute or two, and the voltage is
again raised slowly to the previous level.

In this study, we do not reproduce quality preparation achieved in [26].

Instead,
the interest is to see what is the behaviour of a technical material prepared with less
stringent procedure. As we know that Plasma glow discharge (PGD) is an eﬃcient way
of cleaning the surface, and as ﬁeld emission is also depending of surface contamination.
Surface sputtering can be a way to insure the reach of a stable high electric ﬁeld without
breakdown or dark current. Mirror surface ﬁnish, obtained using not so trivial technique,
will certainly be wasted during an agressive GD.

Plasma glow discharge is usually applied after we reached 1 nA of current at 1 mm

5

gap from the as received state. The gases injected for the GD are usually a mixture of He
and Ar, with a composition of 50% He and 50% Ar. Sometime pure Ar is solely used. The
total pressure is in all cases comprises between ∼0.15 Torr and ∼0.25 Torr. Noble gases
are chosen to avoid chemistry on the surfaces. Helium is chosen because, for the same
energy, its sputtering potency of material is less than Ar. The gases are coming directly
from compressed gas cylinder and are injected via the leak valve. A +400 V to +600 V
bias is applied between a third electrode, not shown on Fig.1, and the two electrodes
to be tested. The pressure and the energy of the ions in the GD are adjusted, so that
the plasma wraps around the electrodes. The distance between the three electrodes are
around 6 cm and the time of the PGD can last between 40 to 60 minutes.

Finally, as it is known from literature that pressure can aﬀect the breakdown onset
threshold, and that dark current appearance is aﬀected by the gas species [11]. The
system is baked not only after air venting but also after each plasma. By this mean we
are minimizing any role that the pressure and the gas composition would have in FE or
arcing.

3 Results

Before presenting results obtained with our electrodes, it is of importance to have in minds
results obtained by Furuta et al [26, 27] and Diamond [25, 28]. According to Furuta’s
publication, the design of their electrodes are equivalent to ours. They have obtained for
stainless steel, Cu, Ti and Mo with mirror ﬁnished surfaces the results summarized in
Table.3. Those results have been obtained not only with mirror ﬁnished surfaces, but the
assembly of their system and the mounting of their electrodes, were done in class 1 and
class 10, respectively, clean room.

All the current vs electric ﬁeld plots presented in [26] and in this work can be ﬁtted
using the following I = c E2 e−a/E, see Fowler-Nordheim equation (equ.1), with I being
the current, c and a are some constants, and E is the applied electric ﬁelds. From those

where Es = β · E and the work function, for Mo, Φ is taken equal to 4.2 eV. However,
the aim of this paper is not to try to compare another list of F-N parameters, nor trying
to understand the ﬁeld enhancement dependance vs the gap etc... Hence, all these topics
won’t be discussed here. The goal is to report how surface conditioning can lead to stable
operation under the presence of an high electric ﬁeld. It is also to report on the erosion
of the materials upon the ﬁeld processing.

to the anode.

3.1 Aluminium Results

3.1.1 Al-Al electrodes

Pristine as received Al electrodes were tested. The ﬁrst test after a thorough bake of the
chamber led to a dark current of 1nA at a gap of 1 mm for a ﬁeld of 7.1 MV/m. The gap
between the electrodes was set at 4 mm and the electrodes were conditioned overnight by
applying 29 kV and drawing 7 nA of current. The next day the dark current measured
increased to 13 nA. Several dark current curves were then produced and compared to
the as received test, Fig.4. The obvious conclusion is that at this level this DC electrical
conditioning did not lead to any improvement.

The subsequent test was to clean and condition using ﬁrst an He plasma of 0.26 Torr.
The sputtering rate of 500 eV He ions on Al is 0.16 [6]. The 1 nA at 1 mm gap is reached
for a ﬁeld of 13.5 MV/m. Subsequent He plasma kept improving the results. However,
a few breakdown did happen during the voltage processing. The best improvement was
obtained after an ArGD at a pressure of ∼0.1 Torr and results are presented in Fig.5.
The 1 nA at 1 mm gap (full circles) is reached for a ﬁeld of 42 MV/m. When leaving the
system at this level of ﬁeld and dark current an improvement, decrease of dark current
over time, is observed Fig.5 full circles. In subsequent test, also with diﬀerent materials,
this improvement was occasionally observed. However, in some cases the current increased
more than the double of the reached value.

In the next test an He-Ar plasma was used to clean the same electrodes. The be-
haviour, after pumping out the noble gases, was that no FE was observed until break-
down. The Al electrodes did hold stably (12hours) a ﬁeld of 42 MV/m without dark
current at 1.5 mm gap. At some point in time, when holding the ﬁeld at 45 MV/m an
arc occurred and emission current 350 nA could be measured. Nevertheless, damages due
to this breakdown as well as the other occurring during the voltage processing, where

not suﬃciently severe that still a current of 1 nA at 1 mm was measured for a ﬁeld of
41.5 MV/m. Finally, the best result obtained playing this game of He-Ar GD, was to hold
a ﬁeld of 52 MV/m at 1 mm without dark current. However, at some point an arc more
violent than the previous one, will suﬃciently damage the cathode that no more GD will
be able to restore the holding of the high electric ﬁeld. A summary of the performance
obtained with Al electrodes is shown in Table.4.

3.1.2 Mirror Finished Al Anode

We then replaced the damaged Al cathode by a pristine mirror like ﬁnish Al (6082)
cathode, machined to an Ra of 3 nm. The previously damaged mushroom anode was
reused, after having been solely wiped with alcohol before reinstallation in the UHV
system. The damages on the anode were localized around the summit of the anode, and
similar to the one shown in Fig.6 right picture.

Figure 6: Breakdown damages withstood by the Al cathode (mirror ﬁnished-left) and
anode (right) during the conditioning period. Scale in cm.

With this conﬁguration, the as received system held stably without dark current, an
electric ﬁeld of less than 36 MV/m. At this value, an arc occurred. Inspection of the
cathode through the viewport of the UHV system showed pitting, hence damages. An
He-Ar GD was then applied to cure and clean the electrodes. Results are summarized in
Table.4. The column labelled <0.05 nA shows the ﬁeld strength held without measuring
any FE. The System held the 90 MV/m electric ﬁeld at 750 µm, and broke down at
92 MV/m. The vacuum arcing was so severe that no further PGD was able to restore
such ﬁelds. Final damages of the Al electrodes upon removal are shown in Fig.6. The
results show that the breakdown is cathode initiated as the cathode was pristine and the
anode was already severely damaged.

3.2 Copper results

Oxidized copper electrodes were tested solely after a PGD. Even after a PGD and the
voltage processing, the electrodes are still very oxidized. Cleaner spots around the hole
of the anode were observed at the end of the testing. Damages on the cathode were also
visible. The electrodes were then cleaned by chemical etching by use of a phosphoric
based solution Polynoxr. They were subsequently rinsed under tap water and after
drying, cleaned with ethanol. A last test was conducted by installing a mirror diamond
turned OFHC Cu cathode (Ra ∼ 3 nm) and the already used Mo and then a SS anode.

3.2.1 Cu-Cu electrodes

The results obtained seem to show that there is no inﬂuence from the anode hole in the
obtention of the high gradient. If we compare to results in Table.3 [26] for clean copper.
All damages were localized around the hole of the mushroom. Comparing to Al, craters
in the Cu were neither as deep, neither as extended see Fig.2 and the 2 spots, compared
to damages in Fig.6. The damages on the anode did stay localized near the hole. That
suggest two possibilities without excluding a combination of the two. The energy in the

arc was not suﬃcient to vaporize the Cu materials, by melting and sputtering the melted
Cu; and thus despite that Cu has a higher sputtering rate than Al. Or the ﬁeld was not
strong enough to pull out droplets of Cu which could have then been vaporized [29].

3.2.2 Mirror ﬁnished Cu anode

As results from Al seems to indicate that the breakdown is cathode initiated, a combina-
tion of a mirror ﬁnished cathode with previously used Mo (vacuum ﬁred ) and SS anode
was tested. Those anodes have sustained damaged far less important than the Al anode
pictured in Fig.6. Results of the Cu-Mo conditioning is shown in Table.5. The condi-
tioning of the ”as received” electrode happened following the ”breakdown processing” or
spark processing, and thus until a more severe breakdown brought the Cu anode to emit
at the level of 800 nA, at 3 mm gap. During the ﬁrst 500 eV ArGD, small breakdown
could be seen on the Cu cathode. Probably being dust burning away. Results obtained
after plasma processing did improve the situation but not to the level of the two clean
Cu electrodes. It was expected that higher ﬁelds could be reached, as in the case of using
two Cu electrodes, Table.5, or two Mo electrodes (see Table.6).

The Mo anode was exchanged for a SS anode, and the Cu cathode was turned 180 on
its axis. As the anode arm sags, damages on the cathode are not localized on the center
of the anode, hence allowing to expose a pristine area.
the maximum ﬁeld held with
this pair was 11 MV/m at 3 mm gap, and thus after an ArGD. From these last result,
no conclusion should be drawn on the coupling of this last pair, as some experimental
hypothesis could explain them.

3.3 Stainless steel, titanium and molybdenum results

Main results obtained, at 1 mm, for stainless steel (SS), Ti and Mo are summarized in
Table.6.

3.3.1 Stainless Steel

SS electrodes were electrically processed the same way as Al electrodes. After plasma
treatment, the best ﬁeld achieved was 68 MV/m with dark current below the 10 pA
detection limit. The latest breakdown, was not recoverable by the use of a PGD. Upon
removal of the electrodes, damages were located at the top of the mushroom. However,
craters were not as profound or as wide as for Al electrodes (in Fig.6). The damages
If we looked at the data
are less extended as the one observed on the Cu electrodes.
in Table.1, it is then not surprising. Eﬀectively, both the melting point and the young

modulus of SS are far above the copper’s values. However, as tiny amounts of vaporized
or sputtered material from the anode can be prejudicial to the working of FEAs; avoiding
even soft breakdowns seems to be a good strategy.

3.3.2 Titanium

In the case of Ti, we have observed after plasma treatment, a stable ﬁeld holding at
52 MV/m without FE. From 53 MV/m on, dark current appeared and reached 1 nA
at 62 MV/m, cf Fig.7 (diamonds). The ﬁeld held there for a few minute until arcing,
bringing the current above 1 µA. The ﬁeld was then reduce to 35 MV/m in order to get
a 1 nA current value, cf Fig.7 (squares.) This current value did decrease over 56 hours of
35 MV/m ﬁeld processing. A few MV/m were then gained to bring back the current to
1 nA. It is possible that after a soft breakdown leading to dark current emission around
1 µA, no rise in pressure can be detected. At a pressure of 2.10−9 Torr, gas released
by ESD process can in principle be detected. A simple calculation will show that such
a current will produce a gas ﬂux of ∼3.10−9 Torr.l.s−1, hence an increase of pressure of
∼2.10−11 Torr; assuming an ESD coeﬃcient of 10−2 molecule/electron. This is below the
resolution of our instrumentation.

A subsequent ArGD for 90 minutes at 580 eV under pressure varying from 0.156 Torr
to 0.174 Torr was done. During this PGD, the Ar gas was evacuated several time and
then replaced by new Ar coming from the cylinder. The ﬁeld held after this plasma was
61 MV/m. The voltage was then increased and ﬂuctuation in the emitted current below
50 pA were observed, above 63 MV/m the dark current was ﬂuctuating around 0.1 nA
and thus until 67 MV/m, see Fig.8. Field conditioning over a week showed, like in the
case of Al or SS, an improvement in the dark current emission. The ﬁnal stable electric
ﬁeld obtained for 1 nA at 1 mm gap is 55 MV/m, see insert in Fig.8. Above this level of
ﬁeld, the dark current does not diminish but it increases with time, Fig.8.

Upon inspection of the electrodes after their extraction from the chamber; damage
spots can be seen on either one of the electrodes. Damages are located on the anode
around the top of the mushroom, and 4 separated spots can be seen on the cathode
spread over a trail of 1 cm long. Damages on Ti anode are similar to the one seen on the
SS and Cu anodes, in extension and morphology (melted area).

3.3.3 Molybdenum

Vacuum ﬁred Mo electrodes were installed in the system, the best results are summarized
in Table.6. A simple 25Hz optical camera was viewing the electrodes hence the space
in between. When running, no light is present in the system enclosure. During the soft
events, a ﬂash is seen on the TV screen and a jump in current intensity, below 0.1 nA,
is measured sometime associated to a pressure increase. The ﬂash is localized and take
the full space occupied between the electrodes. During harder breakdowns, sound can
be heard coming from the enclosure. After these soft breakdowns, the voltage could still
be increased. In order to have a chance to detect breakdown precursor, fast acquisition
and very high sensitivity, to single photon, are mandatory. However, such simple optical
system can be used as an interlock system for our FEL.

As for the Ti electrodes, dark current appears at some voltage. Raising the ﬁeld
increased the dark current until breakdown occurs. Dark current plots from as received
electrodes(triangles), and after three plasma treatments are presented in Fig.9. The ﬁrst
ArGD push the limits of the dark current onset (diamonds) until a hard breakdown
occurs, bringing the current over the µA. The onset and the 1 nA limit is then greatly
reduced (squares). The second ArGD allows to partially recuperate from this breakdown
(asterisks). A third plasma He-Ar, does not bring any extra improvement (crosses in
squares). Mo conditioning from broad electrodes at large gap (> 500µm) is similar as
conditioning with short gaps. Mo reach higher gradient than Cu but it sparks more to
get there [24], hence showing more damage than Cu, Fig.2. From this, it is obvious that
a special electrodes conditioning procedure must be used to process them, and thus to
protect the electron source.

3.3.4 Titanium vacuum ﬁred

Original Ti electrodes were re-installed after vacuum ﬁring and the results, for comparison
with non ﬁred Ti, are presented in Table.6. After vacuum ﬁring the Ti became gray black.
This color can be the mark of TiH2 or TiO2 in the rutile form, or Ti3O5. Damages, all
localized on the top of Ti anode, can be seen on Fig.3. Upon a close look, the involuntary
coating is removed by the severe breakdowns sustained by both electrodes.

Given the rather poor performances, in ﬁeld holding for the Mo electrodes, compare to
literature values, and the colour of the Ti electrodes; it is suspected that the vacuum ﬁring
did degrade the Mo properties instead of improving them. The pressure in the vacuum
furnace should have been around 10−5 Torr. Ti and Mo cathodes were sent for surface
analysis, X-ray photoelectron (XPS) and Auger (AES) spectroscopy. Upon AES analysis,
both electrodes surface exhibit high contents of carbon (C) and oxygen (O), higher than
normal air exposure. Nitrogen (N) is also present on the Mo surface. Nitrogen cannot be
seen on Ti as Ti and N overlaps under AES analysis. Under XPS analysis, a shift of about
5 eV to higher binding energy, for both Mo 3d5/2 and Ti 2p3/2 is observed. Such shift
can be the marked of TiO2 and MoO3 [30]. The Mo shows no discoloration, suggesting
the formation of a thin trioxide ﬁlm. The conclusions of it are, ﬁrst of all a small air leak
might have been present in the furnace. Secondly, a bad heat treatment will bring the
opposite results in term of ﬁeld holding.

4 Conclusions

Plasma glow discharge is a very eﬀective way to enhance the DC ﬁeld holding in between
two broad electrodes. It allows also to restore and sometime improve the DC ﬁeld limit
achieved after a breakdown event leading to dark current emission. This dark current
follows the FN law.

The downside of such treatment, for Al, Cu and SS electrodes, is that the surfaces hold
the ﬁeld until breakdown with no or little warning. No increase of pressure is recorded, but
sometime some current variation in the tens of pA might appear. Such ﬂuctuations can
be the sign of a forthcoming breakdown, if any, but the time scale can vary from minutes
to hours. In the hunt of the precursor breakdown, in the framework of an interlock for
the 500 kV pulser, some highly sensitive and fast photomultiplier will be tested in this
100 kV DC test stand.

For Ti and Mo electrodes dark current appears and increases to some intensities until
breakdown occurs. However, during the processing a few sparks occurs, sometime in a
”spitfest” regime. Those sparks are beneﬁcial as they condition the surface. Dark current
at a level of 1 nA can either drift to hundreds of nA, fall back to less of hundred of pA or
stay stable. So far, the prediction for its evolution is only empirical.

Finally, we have without stringent procedure match, or exceeded results obtained by
other labs. However, results for non mirror ﬁnished Ti and Mo were below the ones
obtained elsewhere. In the case of Mo, it is suspected that the vacuum ﬁring did contam-
inate the Mo as it did for Ti, leading to poorer performances as usually reported in the
literature.

In order to ﬁnd the Grail material, the which will hold our requested ﬁeld without
emitting dark current, Niobium seems to be a material of interest. Ion implantation, with

14

nitrogen, is known to harden materials [31, 32]. It is maybe possible that this technique of
hardening can be useful to increase the breakdown threshold of soft materials, as it seems
to have for harder ones [33]. Dark current from electrodes can be lowered by depositing a
pure monolayer of oxygen on the surface; the which will increase the work function of the
electrodes. However, and in the framework of an accelerator electron source, this layer
might have to be regenerated frequently as back bombardement from residual gas ion will
cleaned up the surface.

Abstract

The aim of this contribution is to study the particle dynamics in
a storage ring under the inﬂuence of noise. Some simpliﬁed stochastic
beam dynamics problems are treated by solving the corresponding
Fokker-Planck equations numerically.

1 Introduction

Colliders have become an important tool in high energy physics. For ex-
ample, HERA, the electron-proton collider at DESY, consists of a 820 GeV
proton ring and a 30 GeV electron ring. At the intersections of these two
rings the colliding beam experiments H1 and ZEUS are located. Besides these
colliding beam experiments there are also two internal target experiments:
HERA-B probing the proton beam halo with a wire target and HERMES
using the longitudinally polarized electron beam. The experiments require
optimal performance of the collider i.e. maximum luminosity (collision rates),
high polarization degree and controled beam halo. In order to achieve these
requirements one needs a good understanding of all phenomena and eﬀects
which cause a degradation of the beam quality. The beam constitutes a com-
plicated many particle system of about 1013 charged, ultrarelativistic (v
c)
particles with spin which are distributed in 180 bunches. This ensemble is
subject to external electromagnetic ﬁelds (dipoles, quadrupoles, multipoles
and rf ﬁelds), to space charge ﬁelds and wakeﬁelds. Furthermore, various

≈

1

scattering mechanisms (restgas, intrabeam) must be taken into account, and
in the case of the electrons, radiation phenomena must be included. In ad-
dition to these eﬀects there are also various sources of noise such as rf noise,
power supply noise, random ground motion and quantum ﬂuctuations due
to the radiation. Altogether, the beam constitutes a complicated nonlinear,
explicitly stochastic many particle system.

The goal of accelerator physics is to describe and understand via suitable
models the dynamical behaviour of such a system - in the ideal case in terms
of macroscopic dynamical variables such as particle density and polarization
density (in phase space or conﬁguration space). Mathematically, the system
can be described via a stochastic Liouville equation (for a recent discussion
of this approach in accelerator physics see [1]) or via a stochastic diﬀerential
equation.

In the following we will restrict our considerations to the latter case, the
Langevin-like description of dynamical systems. For more information about
the conceptual foundations of these statistical dynamics problems we refer
the reader to [2, 3].

Our paper is organized as follows: In section 2 we summarize some ba-
sic facts about stochastic beam dynamics in accelerators and we remind the
reader of some mathematical results concerning stochastic diﬀerential equa-
In section 3 we apply the Fokker-
tions and the Fokker-Planck equation.
Planck description to certain (simpliﬁed) accelerator problems and models
such as beam-beam interaction, rf noise and diﬀusion out of a stable rf-
bucket. Section 4 consists of a summary and a list of open problems for
future work.

2 Stochastic dynamics

In the classical approximation and for the problems to be studied below,
the particle dynamics in accelerators can be written in the form of a multi-
plicative stochastic diﬀerential equation with a Gaussian white noise vector
process ξ(t)

d
dt

y(t) = f (y, t) + T (y, t)ξ(t)

(1)

where y(t) = (x(t), η(t)) consists of the n-dimensional phase space vector
x(t) (n=2,4 or 6 for the orbital motion and n=8 for the spin-orbit mo-
tion [5]) and an m-dimensional Ornstein- Uhlenbeck type stochastic process

×

η(t), f (y, t) is an (n+m)-dimensional known vector function and T (y, t) is
an (n+m)
(n+m) matrix (for more details see for example the review [6]).
In the case of protons, equation (1) describes the stochastic Hamiltonian
dynamics of the coupled synchro-betatron oscillations, and in the case of
electrons - because of radiation phenomena (radiation damping and quan-
tum excitation) - (1) describes a stochastically and dissipatively perturbed
Hamiltonian system [4].

With the Ito and Stratonovich calculus one has the mathematical tools to
study these multiplicative stochastic diﬀerential equations, whose solutions
are in general Markovian diﬀusion processes [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. In this case,
instead of studying the stochastic diﬀerential equations (1) directly [12, 13],
one can also study the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation. The Fokker-
Planck equation is a partial diﬀerential equation for the probability density
y0, t0) of the stochastic process deﬁned
p(y, t) and the transition density p(y, t
|
by equation (1), and in the Ito interpretation of this equation it takes the
following form

If one integrates p(y, t) over the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-type variables η, one
obtains the probability ¯p(x, t) = R p(x, η, t)dη of ﬁnding the system at time
t between x and x + dx in phase space. Using N ¯p(x, t)dx = dn(x, t) where
N is the total number of particles and where dn(x, t) denotes the number
of particles in the volume element dx, ¯p(x, t) can be interpreted (up to a
constant) as phase space density of system (1).

(2) is a partial diﬀerential equation with (n+m+1) independent variables
and a solution of this equation requires initial conditions and suitable bound-
ary conditions (natural (
), periodic, reﬂecting or absorbing). Only few
exact analytical solutions are available (mainly for the low (1+1)-dimensional
case). A detailed and comprehensive review of the Fokker-Planck equation
and a list of methods for its solution is given in [14] to which the reader is
referred.

In the following we will concentrate on the numerical solution of this equa-
tion by direct discretization of space and time. The structure of the Fokker-
Planck equation suggests an operator splitting algorithm [15, 16] which will

stochastic problems and models in colliders.

3 Models of stochastic beam dynamics in ac-

celerators

In this section we consider three stochastic problems in storage rings. As a
ﬁrst example we study how an electron is inﬂuenced by the strong nonlinear
ﬁelds of a counter rotating particle bunch (weak-strong beam-beam interac-
tion model [17, 13, 18]). In this case, the equation of motion for the horizontal
betatron oscillations is given by the following stochastic diﬀerential equation

a strongly localized periodic function.

·

The numerical solution of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation near
a fourth order resonance is depicted in Fig. 1, and Fig. 2 shows a contour
plot of the density, which shows the nonlinear resonance characteristics of
the underlying Hamiltonian dynamics [19]. As initial conditions we have
used a Gaussian distribution localized at the origin of the two-dimensional
phase space (x, ˙x = v). We also want to mention that this model has been
used to compare various numerical tools to study stochastic systems such as
cell-mapping methods, Monte-Carlo methods and ﬁnite diﬀerences [20].

An important problem in proton storage rings is to study the inﬂuence
of rf noise on the particle stability (see for example [21, 22, 23, 13]). Here,
we investigate the diﬀusion out of a stable rf bucket under the inﬂuence of
random energy losses (for example due to scattering) and under Gaussian

¨φ + V1 sin(φ) + V4 sin(4φ) + ∆p(t) = √2Dξ(t)

where V1, V4 denote the voltages of a two-rf system, and where ∆p(t) denotes
the average energy loss due to scattering.

The unperturbed bucket structure is shown in Fig. 3, and Fig. 4 and Fig. 5
show how the distribution diﬀuses outward in phase space thus forming a
coasting beam. The initial distribution was Gaussian and was localized near
the origin.

4 Summary and discussion

In this contribution we have shown that stochastic beam dynamics is an
important issue in accelerator physics. Usually - via various diﬀusion mech-
anisms - noise can lead to a degradation of the beam quality in a collider
(emittance growth, reduced lifetime etc). However, the application of clev-
erly chosen noise in the transverse plane or longitudinal phase plane can also
help to shape and control the beam and its halo [24, 25]. Furthermore, we
have shown that the Fokker-Planck equation is a suitable and helpful math-
ematical tool to treat these stochastic systems. Since only few exact results
are available for this partial diﬀerential equation (especially in higher dimen-
sions) one needs a powerful, reliable, accurate and fast numerical solver. Such
a solver which is based on the operator splitting method has been developed,

and it has been used to study stochastic beam dynamics problems in ac-
celerators. However, longtime calculations and higher dimensional problems
such as stochastic spin-orbit motion in realistic colliders with at least (8+1)
independent variables are certainly beyond the capacity of this and other
codes even if parallel algorithms and high performance computers are used.
So -in addition- to these numerical studies of the Fokker-Planck equation
one also needs perturbative methods such as averaging with all its mathe-
matical subtleties. Furthermore, complementary studies of the dynamics via
direct analysis of the underlying stochastic diﬀerential equations or discrete
stochastic maps are important. Another alternative could be the use of ana-
logue computers (see the recent interesting review [26]). In addition to these
topics noise induced transitions (stabilization by noise) [11] and stochastic
resonance [27] might play an important role in accelerator physics. First

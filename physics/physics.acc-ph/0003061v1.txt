The Hawking-Unruh eﬀective temperature,

¯ha⋆
2πck , due
to quantum ﬂuctuations in the radiation of an accelerated
charged-particle beam can be used to show that transverse
oscillations of the beam in a practical linear focusing chan-
nel damp to the quantum-mechanical limit. A comparison is
made between this behavior and that of beams in a wiggler.

I. INTRODUCTION

Many of the eﬀects of quantum ﬂuctuations on the be-
havior of charged particles can be summarized concisely
by an eﬀective temperature ﬁrst introduced in gravita-
tional ﬁelds by Hawking [1], and applied to accelerated
particles (with the neglect of gravity) by Unruh [2].

Hawking argued that the eﬀect of the strong gravita-
tional ﬁeld of a black hole on the quantum ﬂuctuations
of the surrounding space is to cause the black hole to
radiate with a temperature

T =

¯hg

2πck

,

(1)

where g is the acceleration due to gravity at the surface
of the black hole, c is the speed of light, and k is Boltz-
mann’s constant. Shortly thereafter, Unruh argued that
an accelerated observer should become excited by quan-
tum ﬂuctuations to a temperature

T =

¯ha⋆
2πck

,

(2)

where a⋆ is the acceleration of the observer in its instan-
taneous rest frame.

In a series of papers, Bell and co-workers [3], have
noted that electron storage rings provide a demonstra-
tion of the utility of the Hawking-Unruh temperature
(2), with emphasis on the question of the incomplete po-
larization of the electrons due to quantum ﬂuctuations
of synchrotron radiation. The author has commented
on how the Hawking-Unruh temperature can be used to
characterize quickly the limits on damping of the phase
volume of beams in electron storage rings [4], leading to
well-known results of Sands [5].

II. QUANTUM ANALYSIS OF A LINEAR

FOCUSING CHANNEL

Recently, Chen, Huang and Ruth have discussed radi-
ation damping in a linear focusing channel [6–8], ﬁnding
that in such devices the beam can be damped to the
quantum mechanical limit set by the uncertainty princi-
ple. I show here how this result follows very quickly from
an application of the Hawking-Unruh temperature.

A linear focusing channel is a beam-transport system
that conﬁnes the motion of a charged particle along a
straight central ray via a potential that is quadratic in
the transverse spatial coordinates. This potential can
be characterized by a spring constant k, and hence the
frequency ω of transverse oscillations (as observed in the
laboratory frame) of a particle of mass m and Lorentz
factor γ is

ω =s k

γm

.

(3)

If the amplitude of the oscillation in transverse coordi-
nate x is called x0, then the amplitude a0 of the corre-
sponding transverse acceleration is

a0 = x0ω2 =

kx0
γm

.

(4)

To apply the Hawking-Unruh temperature, we con-
sider the motion in the instantaneous rest frame of the
particle. Supposing the transverse oscillations are small,
the instantaneous rest frame is very nearly the frame in
which the particle has no longitudinal motion. Quanti-
ties measured in the instantaneous rest frame will by de-
noted with the superscript ⋆. Thus, in the instantaneous
rest frame the amplitude of the transverse acceleration
as measured is

a⋆
0 = γ2a0 =

γkx0

m

,

the frequency of the oscillation is

ω⋆ = γω,

(5)

(6)

and hence the transverse spring constant of the focusing
channel appears as

k⋆ = mω⋆2 = γk.

(7)

In the instantaneous rest frame, the charge particle
ﬁnds itself in a bath of radiation of characteristic tem-
perature given by eq. (2) with acceleration a⋆ given by
eq. (5). This bath can be regarded as the eﬀect of
quantum ﬂuctuations, which excite transverse oscilla-
tions (having two degrees of freedom) to characteristic
energy U ⋆ (as measured in the instantaneous rest frame)
given by

U ⋆ = kT =

¯ha⋆
0
2πc

=

¯hγkx0
2πmc

.

(8)

The energy of transverse oscillation can also be written
in terms of the (invariant) transverse amplitude x0 as

U ⋆ =

k⋆x⋆2
0

2

=

γkx2
0

2

.

(9)

Hence, the amplitude of excitation of the transverse os-
cillations is

x0 =

¯h

πmc

=

λC
π

,

(10)

where λC is the (reduced) Compton wavelength of the
particle.

The amplitude (10) must, however, be compared to
the amplitude of the zero-point oscillations of the system,
considered as a quantum oscillator:

x0,zero point =s ¯h

γmω

=s λC λ

γ

,

(11)

where λ = c/ω is the laboratory (reduced) wavelength
of the transverse oscillation as measured along the beam
axis. In practical laboratory devices, we will have λ ≫
γλC . Hence, the excitation of the transverse oscillations
by ﬂuctuations in the radiation of the oscillating charge,
as are described by the Hawking-Unruh temperature, is
negligible compared to the zero-point ﬂuctuations of the
transverse oscillations. In this sense, we can say along
with Huang, Chen and Ruth that the radiation does not
excite the transverse oscillations, and those oscillations
will damp to the quantum-mechanical limit.

In futuristic devices, for which γ > λ/λC , i.e., when

γ >

mc2
kλC

,

(12)

quantum excitations of oscillations in a linear focusing
channel would become important. When (12) holds, the
transverse oscillations would be relativistic even when
their amplitude is only a Compton wavelength. The
strength of the transverse ﬁelds in the channel would then
exceed the QED critical ﬁeld strength (in the average rest
frame),

Ecrit =

m2c3
e¯h

= 1.6 × 1016 V/cm = 3.3 × 1013 Gauss,

(13)

2

and the beam energy would be rapidly dissipated by pair
creation.

Another way of viewing a practical linear focusing
channel is that its Hawking-Unruh excitation energy, (8),
is small compared to the zero-point energy, ¯hω⋆/2 =
γ¯hω/2 of transverse oscillations.

The quantum-mechanical limit for transverse motion
can, of course, also be deduced from the uncertainty prin-
ciple:

σxσpx

>
∼ ¯h,

which leads to a minimum normalized emittance of

ǫN =

σxσpx

mc

≈ λC ,

corresponding to geometric emittance of

ǫx =

ǫN
γβz

≈

λC
γ

.

III. SEMICLASSICAL ANALYSIS

In a quantum analysis of a linear focusing channel,
we found that the transverse oscillations can damp to
the limit set by the uncertainty principle. Hence, in a
classical analysis we would expect the damping to be able
to proceed until the transverse amplitude was zero.

Indeed, a simple analysis conﬁrms this. Transform to
the longitudinal rest frame, in which the particle’s mo-
tion is purely transverse. The particle has nonzero kinetic
energy in this frame, but its average momentum is zero.
The radiation due to the transverse oscillation is reﬂec-
tion symmetric about the transverse plane in this frame,
so the radiation carries away energy but not momentum.
With time, all of the energy would be radiated away, and
the particle would come to rest. The transverse oscil-
lations will have damped to zero without aﬀecting the
longitudinal motion.

If we add the concept of photons to the preceding anal-
ysis, we can say that the radiated photons carry away
momentum along the direction of emission, but the ra-
diation pattern is symmetric, so the averaged radiated
momentum is zero. Again, the radiation carries away
energy, now in the form of photons.

Back in the lab frame, we view the photons as car-
rying away a small amount of longitudinal momentum
on average, as a result of the Lorentz transformation of
the energy radiated in the longitudinal rest frame. This
momentum, however, is only that part of the particle’s
longitudinal momentum associated with its transverse os-
cillation; the longitudinal velocity of the particle is unaf-
fected.

On average, the photons carry away no transverse mo-
mentum in the lab frame, and the average momentum of
the radiated photons is therefore parallel to the beam axis

in lab frame. However, there is no need to argue that the
momentum of individual radiated photons is parallel to
the beam axis, nor to imply that the matter of the focus-
ing channel absorbs transverse momentum in a manner
than aﬀects the kinematics of the radiation process [7].

IV. COMPARISON OF A LINEAR FOCUSING

CHANNEL TO A WIGGLER

A comparison with the behavior of particle beams in
a wiggler is instructive. Here the transverse conﬁnement
of the beam motion is provided by a series of alternat-
ing transverse magnetic ﬁelds. This has the notable ef-
fect that even if a particle enters the wiggle parallel to
the beam axis, transverse oscillations will result whose
amplitude is independent of the initial transverse coordi-
nate.

In contrast, a particle that enters a linear focusing
channel parallel to and along the axis undergoes no os-
cillation, no matter what is the particle’s longitudinal
momentum.

We thereby see that radiation damping cannot reduce
the oscillations in a wiggler to zero unless the longitudinal
momentum falls to zero also, since the wiggler continu-
ally re-excites transverse oscillations for any particle with
nonzero kinetic energy.

Another diﬀerence between a wiggler and a linear fo-
cusing channel can be seen by going to the longitudinal
rest frame.
In the case of the wiggler, the alternating
magnetic ﬁelds in the laboratory transform to ﬁelds that
are very much like a plane wave propagating against the
direction of the laboratory motion of the beam. The ra-
diation induced by this eﬀective plane wave is not sym-
metric with respect to the transverse plane, but results
in a net kick of the particle into the backward direction.
Viewed in the lab frame, we ﬁnd that along with
the damping of their transverse oscillations, the parti-
cles’ longitudinal momenta are signiﬁcantly reduced. To
maintain the initial longitudinal momentum, the beam
must be reaccelerated. The momentum (and energy)
added back into the beam then increases the amplitude
of the transverse oscillations, and the damping cannot
continue beyond some limit.

In contrast, in a linear focusing channel, the transverse
damping proceeds without signiﬁcant reduction in the
longitudinal momentum of the particle, and the trans-
verse oscillations can damp to the quantum limit without
the need of adding energy back into the beam.

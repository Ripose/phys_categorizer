INTRODUCTION

For any particle in a storage ring, the change of the
square of its amplitude of betatron oscillations caused
by sudden energy change δE in smooth approximation is
determined by the equation

x =
δA

2xβ,0δxη + (δxη)

where xβ,0 is the initial particle deviation from it’s closed
orbit; δxη = ηxβ−2(δE/E) –is the change of it’s closed
orbit position; ηx is the dispersion function in the storage
ring; β is the normalized velocity. In the approximation
< 2A the amplitude will be decreased,
δxη
|
if the product xβ,0δxη > 0. Based on this observation,
two schemes of EOC of particle beams based on external
selectivity were suggested in [1] for unbunched beam (RF
turned oﬀ). Pick-up and kicker undulators, laser and
optical systems in these schemes of cooling are similar
to corresponding systems in the method of the optical
stochastic cooling (OSC) [2]. The possibility to enhance
OSC by screening the radiation from some part of the
beam was mentioned also in [3].

In the ﬁrst scheme of EOC two or more identical un-
dulators are installed in diﬀerent straight sections of a
storage ring at a distance determined by a betatron phase
advance for the lattice segment (2p+1)π between pick-up
and ﬁrst kicker undulator and 2p′π between next kicker
undulators; where p, p′ = 1,2,3... are integer numbers.
Undulator Radiation Wavelets (URW) are emitted by a
particle in the pick-up undulator passed through an op-
tical system with movable screens located on the image
plane of the particle’s beam. Then this radiation is am-
pliﬁed and passes through the following kicker undulators
together with the particle.

First, the screens in the optical system open the way
for URW emitted in the pick-up undulator by parti-
cles with higher energies and higher positive deviations
xβ > 0 from their closed orbits. The beam of ampliﬁed
URW in the kicker undulators, in this case is similar to
the moving prototype of the target T2 considered in [1],
[4] if deﬁnite phase conditions are fulﬁlled in the optical
system to inject particles in the kicker undulators at de-
celerating phases. If the betatron phase advance for the
lattice segment between pick-up and kicker undulators is
(2p + 1)π and the deviation of the particle in the pick-up
undulator xβ > 0, then the deviation of the particle in
the kicker undulators comes to be xβ < 0. In this case
the energy loosed by particles is accompanied by a de-

crease in both energy spread and amplitudes of betatron
oscillations of the beam. So the EOC is going both in the
longitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom. After the
screen will open images of all particles of the beam the
optical system must be switched oﬀ. Then the cooling
process can be repeated.

Second modiﬁcation of EOC method uses the pick-up
undulator followed by even number of kicker undulators
installed in straight sections of a storage ring. The dis-
tances between neighboring undulators are determined
by the phase advance equal to (2p + 1)π. In this scheme,
the deviations of particles in undulators ”i” and ”i+1”
xβi+1 and that is why the decrease of energy
are xβi =
of particles in undulators does not lead to change of the
particle’s betatron amplitude at the exit of the last un-
dulator. So it leads the cooling of the particle beam in
the longitudinal coordinate only.

−

A third modiﬁcation of EOC method can be suggested.
It uses the pick-up undulator and even number of kicker
undulators installed in straight sections of a storage ring
at distances determined by a phase advance (2p + 1)π
between the pick-up and next neighboring kicker undu-
lators as well. If the particle decreases its energy in odd
undulators and increases it in even ones, then the change
of the energy of the particle in undulators leads to de-
crease of their betatron amplitudes and do not lead to
change of their energy at the exit of the last undulator.
In this case cooling of the particle beam is going in the
transverse coordinate only.

The wavelets of UR emitted by a particle in the pick-
up undulator after ampliﬁcation in the optical ampliﬁer
interact eﬃciently with the particle in the kicker undu-
lators. Radiation from one particle does not disturb tra-
jectories of other particles if an average distance between
particles in a longitudinal direction is more, than the
length of the URW, M λUR, where M is the number of
the undulator periods; λUR is the wavelength of the emit-
ted undulator radiation (UR). This case is named “single
particle in the sample”. It corresponds to the beam cur-
rent

If overlapping of other particles with URW occurs
(more than one particle in the sample), then ampliﬁed
URW does not disturb the energy and amplitudes of beta-
tron oscillations of other particles of the beam in the ﬁrst
approximation. It leads to an increase of their amplitudes

in the second approximation because of the stochasticity
of the initial phase of the URW for other particles.

In the second method the URW emitted by a parti-
cle in the pick-up undulator and ampliﬁed in the optical
ampliﬁer interact eﬃciently with the same particle in the
kicker undulators and do not disturb amplitudes of be-
tatron oscillations of other particles independently of the
average distance between particles.

In the third method the ampliﬁed URW do not dis-
turb the energy and amplitudes of betatron oscillations
of other particles of the beam in the ﬁrst approximation.
It leads to a week increase in theirs betatron amplitudes
in the second approximation because of the stochasticity
of the initial phase of the URW for other particles.

In these schemes of cooling at ﬁrst approximation, the
degree of cooling of high current beams is higher, if the
transverse dimensions of the URW in the kicker undula-
tors are less then the transverse total (dispersion + beta-
tron) dimensions of the being cooled particle beam as in
this case the particles outside the URW do not interact
with the URW and the characteristic current (2) is in-
creased in the ratio of the areas of the particle beam and
URW. It means that high dispersion- and beta- functions
in the straight section of the storage ring have to be used
at the location of the pick-up and kicker undulators.

The considered schemes are of great interest for cooling
of fully stripped ion, proton and muon beams. Laser
cooling, based on nuclear transitions has problems with
low-lying levels [5]. Enhanced optical cooling of heavy
ions, on the level with optical stochastic cooling, is the

where Z is the atomic number [6].

II. THE RATE OF COOLING

The total energy radiated by a relativistic particle
traversing a given undulator magnetic ﬁeld B of ﬁnite
length is given by

Etot = 2

3 r2

pB2γ2M λu,

(3)
where B2 is an average square of magnetic ﬁeld along
the undulator length M λu; γ is the relativistic factor;
rp = Z 2e2/Mpc2 is the classical radius of the particle;
Z = 1 for electrons, protons and muons. All other sym-
bols have theirs standard meanings. For a plane har-
monic undulator, B2 = B2
0/2, where B0 is the peak of
the undulator ﬁeld. For helical undulator B2 = B2
0.

The expression for the wavelength of the undulator

radiation is

λUR,k =

λu
2kγ2 (1 + K 2 + ϑ2),

where λUR,k is the wavelength of the kth harmonic of
UR; ϑ = γθ; θ, the azimuth circle angle and K is the
deﬂection parameter given by

where β⊥ = K/γ is the maximum deﬂection angle of a
particle from the direction of its closed orbit; f is the rev-
olution frequency; Nkick is the number of kicker magnets;
αampl is the gain in optical ampliﬁer.

The damping time for the particle beam in the longi-

tudinal degree of freedom is

τ = ∆Eb/Ploss,
where ∆Eb is the energy spread of the particle beam.

(11)

According to (11), the damping time of the particle
beam in the longitudinal plane is shorter, proportionally
to its energy spread (not to the initial energy of particles).
Moreover, because of non-exponential decay of its both
energy and angular spreads the degree of cooling is much
higher than 1/e reduction of the beam emittance [1].

If in the pick-up method of cooling the screen of the
optical system will open images of all particles of the
beam and at this moment it will be stopped, the open
particles will continue to loose their energies up to the
moment when they will be displayed inward to the dis-
tances corresponding to overlapping their URW by the
screen. After this time all particles will stay at a thresh-
old energy with the energy spread determined by the
jump of the particle energy ∆Eloss = Ploss√nc/f , where
nc = (i/ic)(σURW /σb) is the number of particles in a
sample; σURW is the transverse area occupied by the
URW and σb is the area occupied by the particle beam.

The minimum rms transverse dimension of the beam
σx is determined by jumps δxη of the closed orbit of
particles. According to (1),

(12)
where Nc = (∆Eb/∆Eloss)nc is the number of interac-
tions of particles with URWs. In this case the value

In the smooth approximation the relative phase shifts
of particles in their URWs radiated in the pick-up un-
dulator and displaced to the entrance of kick undulators
depend on theirs energy and amplitude of betatron os-
cillations.
If we assume that the longitudinal shifts of
URWs ∆l < λUR/2, then the amplitudes of betatron os-
cillations, transverse horizontal emittance of the beam
and the energy spread of the beam, in the smooth ap-
proximation, must not exceed the values

γ−2 and αc are local slip and momentum

compaction factors between undulators. Strong limita-
tions (14) to the energy spread can be overcame if, ac-
cording to the decrease of the high energy edge of the
being cooled beam, a change in time of optical paths of
URWs is produced. Special elements in storage ring lat-
tices (short inverted dipoles, quadrupole lenses et al.) to
decrease the slip [7] can be used as well. With cooling
of fraction of the beam at a time only, the lengthening
problem diminishes also as the ∆E/E now stands for
the energy spread in the part of the beam which is under
cooling at the moment.

The power of the ampliﬁer is equal to the power of the

The transverse selectivity of radiation (movable screen)
can be arranged with help of electro-optical elements.
These elements contain crystals, which change its refrac-
tion index while external voltage applied. This technique
is well known in optics [8]. In simplest case the sequence
of electro-optical deﬂector and a diaphragm followed by
optical lenses, allow controllable selection of radiation
generated by diﬀerent parts of the beam.

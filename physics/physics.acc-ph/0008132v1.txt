BEAM LOADING COMPENSATION IN THE MAIN LINAC OF CLIC

D. Schulte and I. Syratchev, CERN, 1211 Geneva, Switzerland

Abstract
Compensation of multi-bunch beam loading is of great im-
portance in the main linac of the Compact Linear Collider
(CLIC). The bunch-to-bunch energy variation has to stay
below 1 part in 103. In CLIC, the RF power is obtained
by decelerating a drive beam which is formed by merging
a number of short bunch trains. A promising scheme for
tackling beam loading in the main linac is based on vary-
ing the lengths of the bunch trains in the drive beam. The
scheme and its expected performance are presented.

1

INTRODUCTION

Multi-bunch beam loading is a strong effect in the main
linac of CLIC. It needs to be compensated with help of the
RF to avoid extreme variations of the beam energy along
the pulse. Several approaches to solve the problem exist.
All of them are based on manipulations of the drive beam
which generates the RF power.

The ﬁrst possibility is to reduce the bunch charge in the
ﬁrst part of the drive-beam pulse [1]. In this scheme, the
ﬁrst bunch has about 70 % of the nominal charge. The
charge is then slowly increased from one bunch to the next
until it reaches the nominal value. This charge ramp cre-
ates a ramp in the RF voltage. By carefully shaping the
charge ramp, one can achieve beam-loading compensation.
In principle, this compensation can be perfect. However, it
may be very difﬁcult to control the bunch charge with the
required precision so as to achieve the required compensa-
tion of the gradient variation ∆G/G0 ≤ 10−3 (G0 is the
nominal gradient).
Another method is described in reference [2]. It achieves
∆G/G0 ≈ 2 × 10−3. It requires additional hardware and
may compromise the stability of the drive beam in the de-
celerator.

In a third option, presented in this paper, one creates a
ramp in the current of the drive-beam pulse comparable to
the ﬁrst option. But instead of varying the bunch charge,
one varies the number of bunches per unit length of the
pulse. This can be achieved by modifying the drive beam
in the drive-beam injector [3]. To understand this, it is nec-
essary to understand the drive-beam generation, which is
described below.

2 THE DRIVE-BEAM GENERATION

The drive beam is produced and accelerated at a frequency
of about 937 MHz. In the injector of the drive-beam linac,
one has a sub-harmonic buncher which can be switched to

rectangles.

ﬁll either odd or even buckets.
In the drive-beam accel-
erator, the beam then consists of short trains of bunches
that ﬁll every second bucket. The ﬁrst train ﬁlls the odd
buckets, the immediately following second train ﬁlls the
even ones, and this pattern is then repeated [4]. The cur-
rent in the drive-beam accelerator, and consequently the
beam loading, therefore remains constant. After acceler-
ation, the trains are separated using an RF-deﬂector run-
ning at half the linac frequency. The ﬁrst train is deﬂected
into a delay loop and merged with the second one in a sec-
ond RF-deﬂector, see Fig. 1. The newly created pulses are
separated by gaps that allow conventional deﬂectors to be
switched on and off.

They are sent into two combiner rings [5]. These rings
have a circumference equal to the distance between two
pulses plus (or minus) a quarter wavelength. This allows
to merge four pulses to form a single one, using an RF-
deﬂector. The new pulse has four times as many bunches
as each of the initial ones, with a distance between the
bunches that is four times smaller. The bunches comprising
the four pulses have been inter-leaved by this operation so
that the ﬁrst bunch of each of the initial pulses is one of the
ﬁrst four of the ﬁnal pulse.

The ﬁrst ring is followed by a second one, four times
larger, which merges four of the pulses of the ﬁrst ring.
At the end, the bunch-to-bunch distance has been reduced
from the initial 64 cm to only 2 cm. In the following, each
64 cm long section of the beam pulse is called a bin and it
contains 32 bunches. The bunches that were in the ﬁrst bin
of each initial train are in the ﬁrst bin of the ﬁnal pulse. The
bunches that were in the second bin of an initial pulse are
in the second bin of the ﬁnal pulse, and so on.

Figure 2: The scheme of delayed switching. In this example,
each train contains 5 bins (an arbitray number chosen for better
visibility). In the upper case the phase is switched at the nominal
time, creating a rectangular pulse.
In the lower case the phase
switch is delayed to create a ramp.

3 DELAYED SWITCHING

In order to create a current ramp in the ﬁnal pulse, the ﬁrst
few bins of this pulse must contain a smaller number of
bunches than nominal. This in turn requires that some of
the pulses after the delay loop have less than the nomi-
nal two bunches per bin. This can be achieved by delay-
ing the switching of the sub-harmonic buncher. The effect
of the nominal switching is illustrated in the upper part of
Fig. 2. The two trains before the delay loop and the pulse
after this loop are shown. In the delay loop, the bunches
of the ﬁrst train are delayed by one nominal train length.
In the lower part of the ﬁgure, the sub-harmonic buncher
is switched slightly later. The bunch that, in the nominal
scheme, would have been the ﬁrst one of the second train is
therefore appended to the ﬁrst train. The second train starts
one bunch later than nominal. As a consequence, the pulse
after the delay loop contains only one bunch in the ﬁrst bin.
The last bunch of the ﬁrst train is appenended after at the
end of the pulse.

The additional tail of the pulse creates no problem in the
combiner ring, as long as the distance to the ﬁrst bin of
the next pulse is long enough to switch the ejection kickers
of the rings on and off. In the drive-beam decelerator, the
additional tail is not important, since it will just add a little
tail to the RF-pulse produced in the power extraction and
transfer structures (PETS).

The switching time can be individually chosen for each
train, so a rather ﬁne ramp in the ﬁnal pulse can be created.
This solution does not require any additional hardware; one
must only be able to switch the sub-harmonic buncher at
non-regular intervals.

4 NUMERICAL RESULTS

To achieve beam-loading compensation in the CLIC main
linac, 11 of the 32 initial trains need to be delayed in the
drive-beam linac. The maximum delay necessary is 11
bins. The gradient seen by the main-linac bunches can be

simulated with ASTPC [6]. In this program, the transient
effects in the PETS of the drive-beam decelerator, as well
as in the main-linac accelerating structures are taken into
account. Each structure is represented by a series of reﬂec-
tors that are located at the cell boundaries. This makes it
possible to simulate precisely the beam acceleration in the
time domain.

The gradient errors depend on which of the trains are
delayed. To ﬁnd a good choice, a number of different de-
lay patterns was created randomly. These were evaluated
with the program and the best case was accepted. For this
case, Fig. 3 shows the RF-pulse as it is produced by the
PETS. This pulse leads to a bunch-to-bunch gradient error
in the main linac that remains below ∆G/G0 = 5 × 10−4,
see Fig. 4. This is better than the required precision of
∆G/G0 ≤ 10−3.
The method described achieves a constant amplitude of
the accelerating ﬁeld in the main linac. The main beam is,
however, not accelerated on the crest of the RF wave, but
at a small phase in the main part of the linac, ΦRF = 6◦.
At the end of the acceleration, this phase is even larger,
ΦRF = 30◦. Since the amplitude is increased in the RF
phase and the beam loading is in phase with the beam, this

leads to an effective phase shift of the total accelerating
ﬁeld during the ﬁrst part of the main-linac pulse. In order
to prevent this, one can think of shifting the delayed trains
before they are merged with the other ones. The shift has to
be such that the bunches are in phase with the main beam.
In this case, not only the amplitude but also the acceleration
phase is maintained.

6 APPLICATION TO CTF3

Delayed switching could also be used in CTF3, the new
CLIC Test Facility, which will be constructed at CERN.
In this case, the switching time will be longer, about 4 ns.
Since only ten pulses are merged to form the drive beam,
one only delays three of them. Again, different cases were
searched for an optimum. The achieved compensation is
very good, about ∆G/G0 ≈ 1.2 × 10−3, see Fig. 6.

5 SIMULATION OF THE DRIVE BEAM

7 CONCLUSION

To estimate the impact of the beam-loading compensation
on the stability of the drive beam in the decelerator, simu-
lations are performed using PLACET [7]. A lattice is cho-
sen in which each six-waveguide structure feeds three main
linac structures.

As a measure of the stability, the maximum ampliﬁcation
of an initial jitter is used, which is determined as follows:
in the simulation, each bunch is cut into slices. The beam is
offset and then tracked through the decelerator. The maxi-
mum offset that the centre of any slice reaches, divided by
the initial offset, is the maximum ampliﬁcation. Figure 5
shows this ampliﬁcation of a transverse jitter along the
drive-beam decelerator. If no transverse wakeﬁelds were
present, the ﬁnal ampliﬁcation factor would be A = √10
from the adiabatic undamping of the motion. As can be
seen, a rectangular current pulse (case 1) is close to this
case. The bunch ramp increases the ampliﬁcation some-
what (case 2). This seems tolerable. Most of the effect is
due to the trailing bunches.

If the delayed trains are shifted in phase, so as to prevent
phase shift of the acceleration ﬁeld, the wakeﬁeld effects in
the drive-beam decelerator may become worse. The sim-
ulation shows that also in this case, the jitter ampliﬁcation
is almost the same as without the shift; they could not be
distinguished in the plot. The method therefore seems to be
practical. But other methods, such as a slow phase change
along the train, might achieve the same result.

The method presented, to compensate the beam loading in
the main linac, achieves the required precision of better
than one part in 1000. It is very simple, can be adjusted to
different switching times, and requires no additional hard-
ware. It seems to be the method of choice for CLIC.

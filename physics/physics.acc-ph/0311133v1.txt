Abstract

Using the pre-bunched electron beam of 5-MeV linear accelerator the coherent
Smith-Purcell radiation (CSPR) from a ﬂat periodic target (made of conductive
layers separated by dielectric gaps) in millimeter wavelength region has been inves-
tigated. The angular distribution of this radiation was measured with a narrow-band
detector and experimental data agree with our theoretical calculations for similar
kind of targets. Such properties of Smith-Purcell radiation as strong dependence of
radiation wavelength on the observation angle overlapping with coherent radiation
eﬀect may be used for a noninvasive bunch length measurement. The possibility
of using the room temperature detectors for single bunch measurements is demon-
strated.

1 Introduction

The diﬀraction radiation (DR) is stipulated by means of dynamic perturba-
tion of electronic shells of atoms and free electrons by an electromagnetic ﬁeld
of a charged particle moving near a conductive target. An eﬀective transver-
sal size of a relativistic electron ﬁeld for its component with wavelength λ is
about γλ where γ - is the Lorentz factor of an electron. This value can reach

macroscopic sizes in ultrarelativistic case, allowing the distance between an
electron beam and the target to be increased. A transition radiation, in con-
trast, is generated during passing of an initial particle through material of a
target. In case of the periodic target to be used, there maybe a constructive
interference of radiation from diﬀerent elements of a target and the radiation
becomes resonant in this case. The special case of resonant diﬀraction radia-
tion, when the electron moves in parallel to a periodic target plane is referred
as Smith-Purcell radiation (SPR) [1]. There are two types of targets for this
geometry of experiment: a volume grating obtained by a periodic deformation
of a continuous surface, and a ﬂat periodic target obtained by alternation of
metal strips and vacuum (dielectric) gaps. Authors of the work [3] suggested
to use CSPR for bunch length measurements. Changing the observation an-
gle (in other words, the CSPR wavelength) one may detect a sharp increase
in CSPR intensity when the wavelength becomes more than a bunch length.
But the usage of a traditional lamellar grating for this aim has some disad-
vantages: for a set of observation angles there may exist deep minima in the
CSPR angular distribution [2]. It leads to signiﬁcant troubles in interpretation
of experimental data. Another method of the beam diagnostics suggested in
[4] is based on the rotation of the grating in the grating plane to change an
eﬀective grating period and needs the developed theory of SPR eﬀect for a
rotated grating that is absent now. As with of grating rotation the spectra of
CSPR became wider and this technique should be investigated both theoret-
ically and experimentally. The use of a ﬂat grating for the beam diagnostic
technique allows one to avoid the angular distribution unevens and to increase
the radiation yield [5,6].

2 Theoretical model

The basis of theoretical model for calculation of radiation characteristics from
a ﬂat target is the exact solution of Maxwell equations for diﬀraction radiation
caused by relativistic electron moving close to a thicknessless ideal conductive
half-plane [7].

As shown in [5,8] the spectral - angular distribution of SPR from a ﬂat grating
consisting of N strips with width a and period d, separated by vacuum gaps
with width (d-a) can be written as:

Fig. 1 shows the calculated dependence of radiation wavelength on the ob-
servation angle which follows from the equation for φ0 = 2πk (Smith-Purcell
dispersion law). It is evidently that, with increasing the observation angle the
spectral lines are shifted to large wavelength region.

With the radiation wavelength exceeding the longitudinal size of an electron
bunch, all the electrons from a bunch emit coherently. In this case radiation
yield, normalized to one electron, increases proportionally to the number of
electrons in the bunch. The yield of coherent radiation for a bunch with number
of electrons Ne in the aperture of the detector ∆Ω registered by the detector
with bandwidth ∆λ can be expressed as follows:

relation between the squared form-factor modulus and radiation wavelengths
for gauss longitudinal distribution of electrons in a bunch. In ﬁgure we consider
a bunchlength Lbunch equal to 3σ in longitudinal distribution of electrons. It is
clear from the ﬁgure that, for example, for 50% level of a maximum intensity
corresponds wavelength λ = 0.7
Lbunch. That is, the measurement of angular
distribution of CSPR (in other words, measurement of spectral dependence of
a CSPR yield) allows a length of an electron bunch to be determined.

The detector may be rotated on the table with radius R = 1 m that allows one
to change angle of photon detection. The center of rotation coincides with a
target center. In the experiment we registered CSPR together with transition
radiation (TR) background from the exit window foil.

4 Experimental results

Figure 4 presents the calculated dependence of CSPR intensity on the angle
of detection in the real aperture of the detector with regard to the spectral
eﬃciency. The experimental relations between CSPR intensity and angle of
observation, the impact parameter and a current of an electron beam are
shown in Figures 5,6,7.

Comparing Figures 4 and 5 it is possible to notice the reasonable agreement

between the theoretical model and experiment. The monochromaticity of the
main maximum is deﬁned by the number of the lattice periods and band pass
of the detector ∆λ/λ > 1/N

12%.

The narrow peaks in Fig. 5 for angles θ = 560 and 730 can be explained by
resonances of a narrow-band detector. To get dependence of CSPR intensity
on the impact parameter, the detector was installed at angle θ = 950 that
corresponded to the maximal value of CSPR.

In Fig. 6 the value h = 0 corresponds to a beam passing exactly through a
target and the dip at this value h is explained by scattering the electrons on
target material.

The approximation of dependence of CSPR intensity on the impact parameter
by exponential function f = F + a
γ<λ> , gives the
value of mean detected wavelength of CSPR < λ >= 7.9
1.3mm, that agrees
well with resonant wavelength of the detector.

For conﬁrming a coherent character of radiation we measured a dependence of
its intensity on pulse current of a macrobunch, Iacc, proportional to the number
of particles in the bunch. It canbe seen from Fig. 7 that for Iacc < I0 ≈

electron beam is square-law, that conﬁrms the coherent character of radiation.
For values Iacc, exceeding 12mA detector starts to work in a nonlinear regime.
It is necessary to notice that the experiment was performed for Iacc < I0
condition.

5 Conclusion

In conclusion we may note that using 5 MeV beam of a linac NPI MSU we
investigated characteristics of CSPR and showed, that the CSPR mechanism
provided the high monochromaticity of radiation even for a target with 8
periods only and the aperture of the detector γ−1, whereas the continuous
component in a spectrum connected with background processes (TR from
exit window, for instance) is small enough. Also it is necessary to pay at-
tention to the fact, that for θ >> 1/γ the CSPR yield practically does not
depend on γ (for γ = 10 and for γ = 1000 diﬀerence is a few percent). The
macropulse power of CSPR is proportional to n
e , where n - the number
of bunches in macropulse, (for a linac NPI MSU estimation from (2) gives
P
0.9W ). For such accelerators as KEK-ATF and SLAC
1010, this power level is

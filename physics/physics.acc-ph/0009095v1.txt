Emittance Growth from the Thermalization of Space-Charge Nonuniformities∗

Abstract
Beams injected into a linear focusing channel typically
have some degree of space-charge nonuniformity. In gen-
eral, injected particle distributions with systematic charge
nonuniformities are not equilibria of the focusing channel
and launch a broad spectrum of collective modes. These
modes can phase-mix and have nonlinear wave-wave inter-
actions which, at high space-charge intensities, results in a
relaxation to a more thermal-like distribution characterized
by a uniform density proﬁle. This thermalization can trans-
fer self-ﬁeld energy from the initial space-charge nonuni-
formity to the local particle temperature, thereby increasing
beam phase space area (emittance growth). In this paper,
we employ a simple kinetic model of a continuous focus-
ing channel and build on previous work that applied system
energy and charge conservation[1, 2] to quantify emittance
growth associated with the collective thermalization of an
initial azimuthally symmetric, rms matched beam with a
radial density proﬁle that is hollowed or peaked. This emit-
tance growth is shown to be surprisingly modest even for
high beam intensities with signiﬁcant radial structure in the
initial density proﬁle.

INTRODUCTION

Experiments with high-current, heavy-ion injectors have
observed signiﬁcant space-charge nonuniformities emerg-
ing from the source. Sharp density peaks on the radial
edge of beam have been measured, but the local incoher-
ent thermal spread of particle velocities (i.e., the particle
temperature) across the beam is anticipated to be fairly uni-
form since the beam is emitted from a constant temperature
surface. When such a distribution is injected into a linear
transport channel, it will be far from an equilibrium condi-
tion (i.e., particles out of local radial force balance), and a
broad spectrum of collective modes will be launched.

The spatial average particle temperature of a heavy ion
beam emerging from an injector is typically measured as
several times what one would infer from the source ther-
mal temperature (∼ 0.1eV) and subsequent beam envelope
compressions, with ¯Tx ∼ 20eV where ¯Tx ∼ [ǫ2
x/(2R2)]Eb.
On the other hand, the radial change in potential energy
from beam center to edge is q∆φ ∼ 2.25keV for a beam
with line-charge density λ ∼ 0.25µC/m (∆φ ∼ λ/(4πǫ0)).
If even a small fraction of such space-charge energy is ther-
malized during collective relaxation, large temperature and
emittance increases can result.

In this paper, we employ conservation constraints to bet-
ter estimate emittance increases from collective thermal-

ization of normal mode perturbations resulting from ini-
tial space-charge nonuniformities characteristic of intense
beam injectors. Past studies have employed analogous
techniques to estimate emittance increases resulting from
the thermalization of initial rms mismatches in the beam
envelope and space-charge nonuniformities associated with
combining multiple beams and other processes[1, 2, 3].

2 THEORETICAL MODEL

We analyze an inﬁnitely long, unbunched (∂/∂z = 0) non-
relativistic beam composed of a single species of particles
of mass m and charge q propagating with constant axial
kinetic energy Eb. Continuous radial focusing is provided
by an external force that is proportional to the transverse
coordinate x, i.e., Fext = −2Ebk2
x, where kβ0 = const
is the betatron wavenumber of particle oscillations in the
applied focusing ﬁeld. For simplicity, we neglect particle
collisions and correlation effects, self-magnetic ﬁelds, and
employ an electrostatic model and describe the transverse
evolution of the beam as a function of axial propagation
distance s in terms of a single-particle distribution function
f that is a function of s, and the transverse position x and
angle x′ = dx/ds of a single particle. This evolution is
described by the Vlasov equation[2],

If no particles are lost in the beam evolution, the Vlasov-

Here, W ≡ R d2x |∇φ|2/(8π) is the self-ﬁeld en-

(R d2xR d2x′ ξ f )/(R d2xR d2x′ f ) is a transverse statis-
tical average of ξ over the beam distribution f . Note that U
includes both particle kinetic energy and the ﬁeld energy of
the applied and self-ﬁelds. These conservation laws follow
directly from Eqs. (1)-(2) and provide powerful constraints
on the nonlinear evolution of the system.

Moment descriptions of the beam provide a simpliﬁed
understanding of beam transport. For an azimuthally sym-
metric beam (∂/∂θ = 0), a statistical measure of the beam
edge radius R ≡ 2hx2i1/2 is employed. Note that R is the
edge radius of a beam with uniformly distributed space-
charge. Any axisymmetric solution to the Vlasov-Possion
system will be consistent with the rms envelope equation[1]

Here, Q = qλ/Eb = const is the self-ﬁeld perveance and

rms x-emittance of the beam and is a statistical measure of
the beam area in x-x′ phase-space (i.e., beam quality). For
general distributions, ǫx is not constant and evolves accord-
ing to the full Vlasov-Poisson system.

3 NONUNIFORM DENSITY PROFILE

We examine an beam with an azimuthally symmetric radial

density proﬁle n =R d2x′ f given by
n(r) =( n0h1 − 1−h

h (cid:16) r

0,

rb(cid:17)pi , 0 ≤ r ≤ rb,
rb < r ≤ rp.

(5)

Here, rb is the physical edge-radius of the beam, n0 =
n(r = 0) is the on-axis (r = 0) beam density, and h and p
are “hollowing” [0 ≤ h ≤ ∞, h = n(r = rb)/n(r = 0),
p ≥ 0] and radial steepening parameters associated with
the density nonuniformity. This density proﬁle is illustrated
in Fig. 1 for the steepening index p = 2 and hollowing fac-
tors h = 1 (uniform), h = 1/2 (hollowed), and h = 2
(peaked). The hollowing parameter h has range 0 ≤ h < 1
for an on-axis hollowed beam and 0 ≤ 1/h < 1 for an
on-axis peaked beam. The limit h → 1 corresponds to a
uniform density beam and h, 1/h → 0 correspond to hol-
lowed and peaked beams with the density approaching zero
on-axis and at the beam edge (r = rb), respectively. For
large steepening index p ≫ 1, the density gradient will be
signiﬁcant only near the radial edge of the beam (r ≃ rb),
and the density is uniform for h = 1 regardless of p.

It is convenient to deﬁne an average phase advance pa-
rameter σ for the density proﬁle (5) in terms of an enve-
lope matched (R′ = 0 = R′′), rms equivalent beam with
uniform density (h = 1) and the same perveance (Q) and
emittance (ǫx) as the (possibly mismatched) beam with a
nonuniform density proﬁle (h 6= 1). Denoting the phase
advance per unit axial length of transverse particle oscilla-
tions in the matched equivalent beam in the presence and
absence of space-charge by σ and σ0, we adapt a normal-
ized space-charge parameter σ/σ0 ≡qk2
β0 − Q/R2/kβ0.
The limits σ/σ0 → 0 and σ/σ0 → 1 correspond to a cold,
space-charge dominated beam and a warm, kinetic domi-
nated beam, respectively. Note that this measure applies
only in an equivalent beam sense. In general, distributions
f consistent with the density proﬁle (5) will not be equi-
libria (d/ds 6= 0) of the transport channel and will evolve
leaving σ ill deﬁned.

4 EMITTANCE GROWTH

We consider an initial beam distribution f with a density
proﬁle given by Eq. (5) and an arbitrary “momentum” dis-
tribution in x′. Such an initial distribution is not, in general,
an equilibrium of the focusing channel and a spectrum of
collective modes will be launched (depending on the full
initial phase-space structure of f ). These modes will phase-
mix, have nonlinear wave-wave interactions, etc., driving
relaxation processes that have been observed in PIC simu-
lations to cause the beam space-charge distribution to be-
come more uniform for the case of high beam intensities.
The conservation constraints (3) are employed to connect
the parameters of an initial (subscript i), nonuniform den-
sity beam with h 6= 0 with those of a ﬁnal (subscript f ),
azimuthally symmetric and rms envelope matched beam
(R′

f = 0 = R′′
Employing Eqs. (4)-(7), conservation of charge (λi =
λf ≡ λ) and system energy (Ui = Uf ) can be combined
into an single equation of constraint expressible as

Eqs. (8) and (9) allow analysis of emittance growth from
the thermalization of initial space-charge nonuniformities.
We numerically solve Eqs. (8) and (9) to plot (Fig. 2)
the growth in rms beam radius (Rf /Ri) and emittance
(ǫxf /ǫxi) due to the relaxation of an initial rms matched
beam (R′
i ) with nonuniform hollowed and
peaked density proﬁles to a ﬁnal uniform, matched pro-
ﬁle. Final to initial beam ratios are shown for hollowing
index of p = 2 and are plotted verses the “hollowing fac-
tors” h (hollow initial density) and 1/h (peaked initial den-
sity) for families of σi/σ0 ranging from σi/σ0 → 0 to
σi/σ0 → 1. Growths are larger for the initially hollowed
proﬁle than the peaked proﬁle and increase with stronger
space-charge (smaller σi/σ0). However, the change in
rms radius (Rf /Ri) is small in all cases, even for strong
space-charge with strong hollowing (h → 0) and peaking
(1/h → 0) parameters. Moreover, the increases in beam
emittance (ǫxf /ǫxi) are surprisingly modest (factor of 2 and
less) for intense beam parameters with σi/σ0 ∼ 0.1 and
greater. At ﬁxed σi/σ0 and increasing steeping factor p,

son equation (2), one obtains to arbitrary order in δφ,

Thus, constrained extrema of F satisfy qφ = µ1x2 + µ2,
corresponding to a uniform density beam centered on-axis.
Variations about this extremum satisfy δF > 0 and are
second order in δφ. Thus, the available electrostatic energy
for thermalization induced emittance increase is modest for
any smooth density proﬁle. This can be demonstrated for
our speciﬁc example using equation (7) to plot ∆F = Wi−
Wf with Ri = Rf verses h and 1/h for p = 2, 8 (Fig. 3).

It has been shown that the rms beam size and emittance
undergo very small decreases on relaxation from a uniform
density beam to thermal equilibrium over the full range of
σi/σ0 ( Min[ǫxf /ǫxi] ≃ 0.97 at σi/σ0 ≃ 0.45)[4]. Thus if
one views the relaxation as a multi-step procedure using the
conservation constraints to connect the initial nonuniform
proﬁle to a uniform proﬁle and then a thermal proﬁle, any
emittance growth will be experienced in the ﬁrst step. This
result together with the variational argument above show
that the emittance growth results presented should be rela-
tively insensitive to the form of the ﬁnal distribution.

Finally, caveats should be given for validity of the theory.
First, the model assumes no generation of halo in the ﬁnal
state and that the initial nonuniform beam can be perfectly
rms envelope matched. Initial mismatches can lead to halo
production and provide a large source of free energy which,
if thermalized, can lead to signiﬁcant emittance growth[1].
Also, although the velocity space distribution is arbitrary in
the present theory, choices that project onto broader spec-
trums of modes will more rapidly phase mix and thermal-
ize. Small applied nonlinear ﬁelds tend to enhance this re-
laxation rate. Initial simulation results in a full AG lattice
are consistent with model predictions presented here and
will be presented in future work.

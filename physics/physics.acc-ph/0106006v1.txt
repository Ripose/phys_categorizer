Abstract

We present the applications of nonlinear local harmonic
analysis methods to the modelling of beam-beam interac-
tion. Our approach is based on methods provided the pos-
sibility to work with dynamical beam localization in phase
space. The consideration of Fokker-Planck or Vlasov-
Maxwell models is based on a number of anzatzes, which
reduce initial problems to a number of dynamical systems
(with constraints) and on variational-wavelet approach to
polynomial/rational approximations for reduced nonlinear
dynamics. We calculate contribution to full dynamics (par-
tition function) from all underlying subscales via nonlinear
eigenmodes decomposition.

INTRODUCTION

In this paper we consider the applications of numerical-
-analytical technique based on the methods of local non-
linear harmonic analysis or wavelet analysis to nonlinear
models of beam-beam interactions which can be charac-
terized by collective type behaviour. We consider dif-
ferent but related models [1] of the beam-beam interac-
tion from the point of view of construction of reasonable
numerical-analytical approaches. It is very important be-
cause some beam-beam effects limit luminosity and sta-
bility of collider. Such approaches may be useful in all
models in which it is possible and reasonable to reduce
all complicated problems related with statistical distribu-
tions to the problems described by systems of nonlinear or-
dinary/partial differential equations with or without some
(functional) constraints. Wavelet analysis is a set of math-
ematical methods, which gives us the possibility to work
with well-localized bases in functional spaces and gives
the maximum sparse forms for the general type of op-
erators (differential, integral, pseudodifferential) in such
bases. Our approach is based on the variational-wavelet
approach from [2]-[13], which allows us to consider poly-
nomial and rational type of nonlinearities. The constructed
solution has the multiscale/multiresolution decomposition
via nonlinear high-localized eigenmodes. In this way we
give contribution to our full solution from each scale of
resolution or each time/(phase) space scale or from each
nonlinear eigenmode. Fig.1 demonstrates such decompo-
sition for the ﬁnite kick term. The same is correct for the
contribution to power spectral density (energy spectrum):
we can take into account contribution from each level/scale
In all models below numerical modelling
of resolution.

demonstrates the appearance of (coherent) high-localized
structures and (stable) pattern formation. Starting in part
2 from beam-beam interaction models [1] we consider in
part 3 the approach based on variational-wavelet formu-
lation. We give explicit representation for all dynamical
variables in the base of compactly supported wavelets or
nonlinear eigenmodes. Our solutions are parametrized by
solutions of a number of reduced algebraical problems one
from which is nonlinear with the same degree of nonlin-
earity as initial models and the rest are the linear problems
which correspond to concrete details of wavelet calcula-
tions. In part 4 we consider numerical modelling based on
our analytical approach.

3 VARIATIONAL MULTISCALE

REPRESENTATION

We obtain our multiscale/multiresolution representations
(formulae (9) below) for solutions of equations (1),(2),(4)
via variational-wavelet approach for the following formal
systems of equations (with the corresponding obvious con-
straints on distribution function), which is the general form
of these equations.

Let L be an arbitrary (non) linear differential/integral op-
erator with matrix dimension d, which acts on some set of
functions

Ψ ≡ Ψ(s, x, p) =

Ψ1(s, x, p), . . . ,

Ψd(s, x, p)

(cid:16)

, s, x, p ∈ Ω ⊂ R3 from L2(Ω):

(cid:17)
LΨ ≡ L(Q, s, x, p)Ψ(s, x, p) = 0,

(5)

where

Q ≡ Qd1,d2,d3(s, x, p, ∂/∂s, ∂/∂x, ∂/∂p) = (6)

Xi1,i2,i3=1

Let us consider now the N mode approximation for solution
as the following ansatz (in the same way we may consider
different ansatzes):

ΨN (s, x, p) =

arskAr(s) ⊗ Bs(x) ⊗ Ck(p)

(7)

N

Xr,s,k=1

We shall determine the coefﬁcients of expansion from
the following conditions (different related variational ap-
proaches are considered in [2]-[13]):

ℓN
kℓm ≡

Z

(LΨN )Ak(s)Bℓ(x)Cm(p)dsdxdp = 0

(8)

So, we have exactly dN 3 algebraical equations for dN 3 un-
knowns arsk. Such variational approach reduces the initial
problem to the problem of solution of functional equations
at the ﬁrst stage and some algebraical problems at the sec-
ond stage. We consider the multiresolution expansion as

the second main part of our construction. The solution is
parametrized by solutions of two set of reduced algebraical
problems, one is linear or nonlinear (depends on the struc-
ture of operator L) and the rest are some linear problems re-
lated to computation of coefﬁcients of algebraic equations
(8). These coefﬁcients can be found by some wavelet meth-
ods by using compactly supported wavelet basis functions
for expansions (7). We may consider also different types of
wavelets including general wavelet packets [2]-[13]. The
constructed solution has the following multiscale/multire-
solution decomposition via nonlinear high-localized eigen-
modes

f (s, x, p) =

aijkAi(s)Bj(x)Ck(p),

which corresponds to the full multiresolution expansion in
all underlying time/space scales. Formula (9) gives us ex-
pansion into the slow part f slow
N,M,K and fast oscillating parts
for arbitrary N, M, K. So, we may move from coarse scales
of resolution to the ﬁnest one to obtain more detailed infor-
mation about our dynamical process. The ﬁrst terms in the
RHS of formulae (9) correspond on the global level of func-
tion space decomposition to resolution space and the sec-
ond ones to detail space. Particular one-dimensional case
of formulae (9) determines the solution of equations (3)
(more exactly corresponding constructions are considered
in other papers presented during this Conference). But,
it should be noted that in this one-dimensional case we
have really nontrivial nonlinear dynamics only for func-
tional parameters of enveloping gaussians, which give the
solution only for linearization of equations (1),(2),(4). As
we demonstrated, our representation (9) provides the solu-
tion as in linear as in nonlinear cases without any perturba-
tion technique but on the level of expansions in (functional)
space of solutions. The using of wavelet basis with high-
localized properties provides good convergence properties
of constructed solution (9). Because afﬁne group of trans-
lation and dilations is inside the approach, this method re-
sembles the action of a microscope. We have contribution
to ﬁnal result from each scale of resolution from the whole
inﬁnite scale of spaces or from each underlying scale: the
closed subspace Vj(j ∈ Z) corresponds to level j of res-
olution, or to scale j. Our full multiresolution/multiscale
decomposition of functional space L2(Rn) of solutions of
initial problems, which is a sequence of increasing closed
subspaces Vj : . . . V−2 ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ . . .,
provides us with formulae (9). This functional space de-
composition corresponds to (exact) nonlinear eigenmode
decomposition.
It should be noted that such representa-
tions give the best possible localization properties in the

corresponding (phase)space/time coordinates. In contrast
with different approaches, formulae (9) does not use per-
turbation technique or linearization procedures and repre-
sents dynamics via generalized nonlinear localized eigen-
modes expansion. So, by using wavelet bases with their
good (phase)space/time localization properties we can con-
struct high-localized coherent structures in spatially-exte-
nded stochastic systems with collective behaviour.

4 MODELLING

Multiresolution/multiscale representations for solutions
of equations from part 2 in the high-localized bases/eigen-
modes are demonstrated on Fig. 2–Fig. 4. On Fig. 2, Fig. 3
we present contribution to the full expansion (9) from level
1 and level 4 of full decomposition. Fig. 4 show the rep-
resentation for full solution, constructed from the ﬁrst 6
eigenmodes (6 levels in formula (9)).

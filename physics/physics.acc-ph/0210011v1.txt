Abstract

Vertical vibration of linac components (accelerating
structures, girders and quadrupoles) in the NLC has been
studied experimentally and analytically. Effects such as
structural resonances and vibration caused by cooling wa-
ter both in accelerating structures and quadrupoles have
been considered. Experimental data has been compared
with analytical predictions and simulations using ANSYS.
A design, incorporating the proper decoupling of structure
vibrations from the linac quadrupoles, is being pursued.

INTRODUCTION

As part of the R&D effort for the Next Linear Collider
(NLC), a program has developed to study the vibrations
induced by cooling water on the NLC components.

An adequate ﬂow of cooling water to the accelerating
structures is required in order to maintain the structure at
the designated operating temperature. This ﬂow may cause
vibration of the structure and its supporting girder. The
acceptable tolerance for vibration of the structure itself is
rather loose ∼ 1µm. However our concern is that this vi-
bration can couple to the linac quadrupoles, where the vi-
bration tolerance is 10 nm, either via the beam pipe with its
bellows or via the supports.

In this paper we will brieﬂy show results obtained for
the NLC RF structure and girder [1], and then focus on
vibration of a linac quadrupole, including consideration of
coupling between the structure and the quadrupole.

2 VIBRATION OF RF STRUCTURE

The structure studied is 1.8 m long and is supported by
a “strongback” (hollow aluminum beam 4x6 inches) of the
same length, Fig.1. In the design, it was assumed that 3
such structures would be mounted on a single 6 m long
girder [2]. The required water ﬂow (at 70MV/m) is about
∼1 ℓ/s for each structure (in total, through four cooling cop-
per tubes). The structure was connected to the quad with
a bellow, and a simple mock-up of a BPM was connected
(glued) to the quadrupole. It should be noted that the NLC
currently plans to use shorter RF structures than the one
studied [3].

Fig.2 displays the results obtained in measuring the
vertical vibration induced by different ﬂow rates pass-
ing through the structure-girder system [1]. Note that
the system considered is above the turbulence threshold
(Re>2000) when the ﬂow > 0.1 ℓ/s. In Fig.2 the water was

supplied by the NLC Test Accelerator (NLCTA) water sys-
tem. In this case, the displacement of the structure-girder
is weakly dependant of the ﬂow variation in the structure
because the supplying cooling water has signiﬁcant ﬂuctu-
ations of pressure in it (external turbulence).

The NLC cooling system will be designed so that pres-
sure ﬂuctuations in the cooling water will be limited (if nec-
essary, by use of passive devices as typically done in indus-
try). Thus, aiming to understand the contribution to vibra-
tion of the internal turbulence occurring inside the structure
itself, we conducted the second set of experiments. In this
case, the structure-girder was installed in a quieter place on
the ﬂoor of the SLD (SLAC Large Detector) collider hall
and the cooling water was gravity-fed from a tank located
∼18 m higher. The structure-girder was bolted to a ∼26T
concrete block initially placed on a rubber mat and then
on sand (in the ﬁrst conﬁguration the block had resonance
at ∼35Hz which was decreased in the second case). The
vibrations were monitored either by piezo-accelerometers
or by seismometers and one piezo-transducer was used to
measure water pressure ﬂuctuations. In both sets of exper-
iments (NLCTA and SLD) the ﬂows in four cooling tubes
were in opposite direction (2 by 2).

We have shown in [1] that the vibration spectrum of
the girder-structure system exhibits a vertical resonance at
∼52Hz. Simulations using ANSYS code have shown that
the natural ﬁrst resonant frequency for such design is about
∼49 Hz, in good agreement with measurements, and corre-
sponds to simplest vertical bending mode Fig.3. These sim-
ulations also indicate that the second and the third modes
are the horizontal dipole at ∼69 Hz and vertical two-nodes
mode at ∼117 Hz, while the fourth resonance is torsional
∼146 Hz. The driving forces (ground motion, pressure
DP/P, ) decrease rapidly with frequency. One possibility to
further reduce the vibration of the structure-girder system
is to design a girder which has a higher ﬁrst resonant fre-
quency. For further studies, we have set a goal of increasing
the lowest resonance frequency to 130 Hz and performed

simulations to understand what modiﬁcations this would
require. One way to stiffen the girder is to increase its di-
mensions. Simulations have shown that keeping the same
material and design but increasing the girder size (6”x4” to
10”x10”) and the wall thickness (from 0.25” to 1”) lead to
a lowest natural frequency of 120 Hz. Such big increase
of the resonance frequency may not be necessary, but the
studies have shown that signiﬁcant improvement is possi-
ble with simple modiﬁcation of the girder design.

about 2% in the current conﬁguration. We also investi-
gated inﬂuence of vacuum in the RF structure (and pos-
sible stiffening of the bellow) on this coupling. No no-
ticeable difference was observed with or without vacuum
(the results displayed in Fig.4 are obtained with a primary
vacuum of about 10−1 Torr in the structure-quadrupole
system). However, we have not yet studied how much cou-
pling is due to the bellow connection and how much due to
transmission via support and concrete.

3 VIBRATION OF RF STRUCTURE AND

COUPLING TO QUADRUPOLE

Using the setup of Fig.1 we have studied the vibration
of RF structure versus ﬂow, and the coupling of vibration
from the RF structure to the EM quadrupole in the case
when RF structure is cooled with gravity-fed water.

Vibration of the RF structure versus ﬂow is shown in
Fig.4. In this case, vibrations are caused mostly by the in-
ternal turbulence occurring in the RF structure. At nominal
ﬂow 1ℓ/s vibration of the structure is ∼110nm, in com-
parison with 350nm obtained with NLCTA cooling wa-
ter [1]. Additional vibrations of the quadrupole are small.
Performing multiple measurements with and without ﬂow,
and analyzing spectra of quadrupole vibration (Fig.5), we
found that the additional vibration of the quadrupole due
to cooling of RF structure above 30Hz is 2.4nm (obtained
as (4.32 − 3.62)0.5, assuming vibrations are uncorrelated),
see Fig.6. Taking lower cut frequency would be statistically
uncertain, due to high background noise. These results sug-
gest that coupling from RF structure to the quadrupole is

One should also note that the present set up is simpliﬁed.
In particular, the quadrupole was placed on small granite
stand (with shims to adjust the height), which was placed
on concrete block (without rigid connections). Such system
had ampliﬁcation – the quadrupole vibration is higher than
the concrete as seen in Fig.4. This can be avoided in real
system.

4 VIBRATION OF EM QUADRUPOLE

The NLC project calls for maximal use of permanent
magnet (PM) quadrupoles which will not have cooling
water. The electromagnet quadrupoles (EM) however
are also prototyped for NLC and we studied vibration
caused by cooling water in such EM quadrupole. The EM
quadrupoles was fed by a standard water supply for a nom-
inal ﬂow of ∼0.1 ℓ/s obtained with pressure difference of
8.5 bar. The quadrupole was installed on a granite table

Fig.7. The table was installed on rubber pads to isolate
the table from the high frequency vibration in the noisy
environment where measurements were performed. This
reduced the high frequency background, but signiﬁcantly
ampliﬁed frequencies below 6-9 Hz, making it possible to
study the effect of cooling water on quadrupole vibration
only above about 10Hz.

For f>20Hz,

the vibration induced by the ﬂow of
∼0.1 ℓ/s in the quad is roughly 3.5 nm±0.25 nm while
1 nm±0.25 nm at rest (averaged on several measurements).
Assuming that the additional vibration is uncorrelated, the
effect due to cooling water itself is: p(3.522 − 1) =
3.35 nm. The result is similar if a lower cut frequency
(e.g. 15Hz) was considered, until below 10Hz where sta-
tistical error becomes too big. Note that earlier studies of
FFTB quadrupole stability [4] have shown that the effect
of the cooling water is on a nanometer level as well, for
quadrupoles that were (in contrast to our study) also prop-
erly placed on movers.

With these data, we can estimate that in the pessimistic
case, if the cooling water will be similar to NLCTA (with
similar pressure ﬂuctuations), vibration of the quadrupoles
will scale to about 7.6nm due to coupling to the RF struc-
tures. In the case of EM quadrupoles, there will be about
3.3nm additional due to cooling of the quadrupoles them-
selves, which in total amounts to p(7.62 + 3.32) = 8.3nm.
This value is below the tolerance but has little margin.
However, simple design optimizations, discussed above,
are expected to reduce these numbers considerably.

Among further studies of RF structure and quadrupole
vibration planned at FNAL and SLAC are: performing
measurements in quieter place, to quantify lower frequency
range; study the case of quadrupole been placed on movers
and realistic independent supports; continuing optimization
of the system as a whole.

5 CONCLUSION

Cooling water can cause vibration of an accelerating
structure both through internal turbulence in the cooling
pipes on the structure, and through pressure ﬂuctuations in
the supply water (external turbulence) [1]. The latter does

not depend on the ﬂow rate through the structure and can be
the dominant source of vibration in practical situations. For
the case studied, mechanical resonances of the structure-
girder assembly explain the measured amplitudes. Opti-
mization of design to increase resonance frequencies is ex-
pected to reduce vibration. Coupling from RF structure to
linac quadrupoles can occur via bellows and the support
but was measured to be at the percent level. Present stud-
ies suggest that the vibration tolerances for the NLC linac
quadrupoles are met, but without much margin. Optimiza-
tion of the girder design to improve its vibration property
is highly desirable and will be pursued.

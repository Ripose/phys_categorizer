Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is a parameter estimation method from in-
complete observations. In this paper, an implementation of this method to the calibration
of HKS spectrometer at Jeﬀerson Lab is described. We show that the application of EM
method is able to calibrate the spectrometer properly in the presence of high background
noise, while the traditional nonlinear Least Square method fail. The preliminary results
of HKS spectrometer calibration is presented.

1. Introduction

Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is a statistical method for parameter esti-
mation from incomplete observations. It is an extension of the Maximum Likelihood (ML)
method well known to physicists. This method was ﬁrst proposed by A. Dempster etc in
[1]. Since its introduction, this method has been used in a wide varieties of applications
such as signal processing, medical image processing and genetics, to name a few ([2]).

The EM method is well suited to handle problems with observations diluted by large
amount of noise, since it is not known a priori a observation is signal or noise. That is why
it is introduced into High Energy physics for track reconstruction in the ATLAS detector
at LHC ([3], [4]). In the presence of track noise, the EM based tracking algorithm can
obtain a track resolution more than two order of magnitude better than traditional Least
Square tracking method .

We have used the EM method in the spectrometer calibration for HKS experiment at
Jeﬀerson Lab. Jeﬀerson Lab HKS experiment aims at obtaining high resolution hyper-
nuclear spectroscopy by (e,e’K) reaction. To achieve this goal,it is essential to perform a
proper spectrometer calibration to optimize the reconstruction resolution of the momen-
tum and angles of scattering electrons and Kaons ([5]). The only high precision calibration
method is to make use of the known masses of Λ,Σ0 hyperons produced from hydrogen in
CH2 target and the narrow width of 12
Λ B hypernuclear ground state from 12C target([6]).
These masses can be produced at the same spectrometer kinematics as the production of
hypernuclei.

2. Nonlinear Least Square Method

Let {π} denote the set of parameters which deﬁnes the reconstruction function. For
example, the {π} can be a set of polynomial coeﬃcients in the polynomial expansion of

2

reconstruction function. The task of calibration now is to ﬁnd the best set of parameters
{π} to optimize the reconstruction resolution. The missing mass Em of (e,e’K) reaction
can be calculated from the focal plane measurement Xi,
i = 1, . . . N, i denotes each
event number, and the reconstruction parameters {π} :
Ei

m = f(Xi, {π}),

(1)

where f is a nonlinear function. The format of f can be derived from the kinematics
equations. Xi represent the trajectories of the particles at spectrometer focal plane.
Let ∆Mi be the diﬀerence between the calculated mass and the known mass value from
Particle Data Book M P DB,
∆Mi = Ei

m − M P DB.

(2)

Finally, we deﬁne a Chisquare as the weighted sum of squared ∆Mi over all events:

where wi is the relative weights of Λ,Σ and 12

Λ B GS events.

The set of parameters {π} which minimize the Chisquare function will deﬁne our opti-
mized reconstruction function. This is a typical nonlinear Least Square (NLS) problem.
The Chisquare function is still a complex nonlinear function and have to be minimized
It is carried out by using CERNLIB Fortran program package
by numerical method.
LEAMAX ([7]).

In case we have a clean signal of hyperons and hypernuclear bound states (The sig-
nal to noise (S/N) ratio better than 6:1), the NLS method works well, as is shown for
simulated HKS data in our Arxiv paper ([5]). However, the HKS spectrometer setup
detects very forward angle e’ and Kaons in order to increase hypernuclear yield. Thus
in real experiment, we see high accidental background between Kaon arm and electrons
produced by Bremsstrahlung photons. For the real data, The S/N ratio in the missing
mass spectrum is almost 1:1 (ﬁg.1). Applying the NLS method to the data results in
wrong calibration. As shown in ﬁg.2, the accidental background under the 12
Λ B gs peak,
which should be ﬂat, now forms an artiﬁcial “bump” as a result of the NLS calibration.
Clearly, the EM algorithm which is robust to noise observations should be used for the
spectrometer calibration of HKS.

3. Expectaton Maximization method

We have two condiderations in order to implement the EM method:

1. EM method is used for parameter estimation with incomplete observation. Taking
i = 1, . . . N, which denotes
advantage of this feature, we can deﬁne a variable Si,
whether event i is a real signal (real coincidence) : Si = 1 or noise (accidental
coincidence): Si = 0, although Si can not be observed by the spectrometer. Thus
instead of minimize the chisquare in eq.3, we will minimize an energy function
deﬁned as
E({Si}, {π}) =

i + λ(Si − 1)2],

2. There is a large number of parameters in the parameter set {π}, to aviod the cal-
ibration process ending up in a local minimum, we introduce an annealing process
([4]). One requires each conﬁguration of the system with energy E obey the Bolz-
mann distribution at temperature T . One then minimizes the expectation value of
the energy function at successively lower temperatures until ﬁnal result at T → 0.

According to Bolzmann distribution, the probability for the system to have conﬁg-
uration {Si, ∆Mi, i = 1, . . . N}, is:

where β is the inverse temperature β = 1/T and Z is the partition function:

P ({Si}, {π}) = e−βE({Si},{π})/Z,

Z =

Z

X{Si}

d{π}e−βE({Si},{π})

The EM algorithm can be divided into the expectation step and the maximization step.
In the expectation step, the expectaion value of the energy function over the unobserved
variable is calculated:

where P ({Si} | {π′}) is the probability function of assignment variables Si conditioned
on the parameter set {π′}, PM is the marginal probability function:

Q({π} | {π′}) =

E({Si}, {π})P ({Si} | {π′})

pi′ can be interpreted as the probability that event i is a real signal. The minimization step
is then to minimize the Q function with respect to the parameter set {π}. Because the
second term is independent of {π}, in the maximization step, we will minimize function:

with respect to {π}. pi′ is deﬁned by equation 10. Again, we have added the relative
weights wi to adjust for the eﬀect of Λ,Σ and 12
Λ B GS events in the calibration. The new
values of the parameter is used to update the probabilities pi′, and the g function is again
minimized. Comparing with eq.3, we can see that the EM algorithm in this case is nothing
but an iteratively reweighted least-square procedure. The weights or probabilies are not
constants now, but functions of ∆Mi or {π}. Example probability functions calculated
for the HKS spectrometer calibration is shown in ﬁg.3.

The minimization of function g is also carried out by CERNLIB Fortran program pack-
age LEAMAX. We have obtained preliminary reconstruction functions by the EM method
described above. The preliminary missing mass spectra of Λ,Σ0 from CH2 target and hy-
pernucleus 12

Λ B from C12 are shown in ﬁg. 1 and ﬁg. 4 overlayed with background.

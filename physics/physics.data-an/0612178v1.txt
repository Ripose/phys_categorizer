On the Combining Signiﬁcances

Abstract

We present the statistical approach to the combining of signal signiﬁcances.

1 What we keep in mind as a signiﬁcance ?

The measure of the excess of observed (or expected events) in the experiment above the
background often is named the signal signiﬁcance. According to ref. [1] “Common practice
is to express the signiﬁcance of an enhancement by quoting the number of standard
deviations”.

Let us distinguish the signiﬁcances of two classes:

•

“the initial (or internal) signiﬁcance” S of an experiment is the expression of two
parameters of the experiment - expected number of signal events Ns and expected
number of background events Nb in the given experiment (“the initial signiﬁcance”
can be considered as a potential for discovery in planned experiments [2]),

“the observed signiﬁcance” ˆS is the expression of observed number of events ˆNobs
and of the expected background Nb [3].

•

The ﬁrst one is a parameter of the experiment. We suppose that it is constant for given
integral luminosity. The second one is a realization of a random variable. The observed
signiﬁcance is considered as an estimator of the initial signiﬁcance.

Why we can consider the observed signiﬁcance as the realization of a random variable?

The observed number of events ˆNobs is the realization of the random variable which obeys
the Poisson distribution, hence the observed signiﬁcance ˆS also is the realization of the
random variable as a function which depends from ˆNobs.

It is easy to show. Let us take, as an example, the “counting” [4] signiﬁcance ˆSc12 and
the signiﬁcance ˆScP [5].
The observed signiﬁcance ˆSc12 is expressed by formula

ˆSc12 = 2

The signiﬁcance ScP is the probability from Poisson distribution with mean Nb to observe
equal or greater than ˆNobs events, converted to equivalent number of sigmas of a Gaussian
distribution, i.e.

We use the method which allows to connect the magnitude of “the observed signiﬁcance”
with the conﬁdence density [6, 7] of the parameter “the initial signiﬁcance”. This method
was applied in many studies [8, 9]. We carried out the uniform scanning of initial signif-
icance Sc12 and ScP , varying Sc12 from value Sc12 = 1 to value Sc12 = 16 using step size
0.075 and varying ScP from value ScP = 0 to value ScP = 6.2 using step size 0.031. By
playing with the two Poisson distributions (with parameters Ns and Nb) and using 30000
trials for each value of Sc12 and ScP we used the RNPSSN function (CERNLIB [10]) to
construct the conditional distribution of the probability (the conﬁdence density) of the
production of the observed value of signiﬁcance ˆSc12 or ˆScP by the initial signiﬁcance Sc12
or ScP , correspondingly. We assume that an integral luminosity of the experiment is a
constant Ns + Nb. The parameters Ns and Nb are chosen in accordance with the given
initial signiﬁcance Sc12 or ScP , the realization ˆNobs is a sum of realizations ˆNs and ˆNb of
two random variables with parameters Ns and Nb, correspondingly.

In Fig.1 the distributions of ˆSc12 of several values of initial signiﬁcance Sc12 with the
given integral luminosity Ns + Nb = 70 are shown. As seen, the observed distributions of
signiﬁcance is similar to the distributions of the realizations of normal distributed random
variable with variance which close to 1. The distribution of the observed signiﬁcance ˆSc12
versus the initial signiﬁcance Sc12 (Fig.2) shows the result of the full scanning.
The normal distributions with a ﬁxed variance are statistically self-dual distributions [7].
It means that the conﬁdence density of the parameter “initial signiﬁcance” S has the
same distribution as the random variable which produced a realization “the observed
signiﬁcance” ˆS. The several distributions of the probability of the initial signiﬁcances
Sc12 to produce the observed values of ˆSc12 are presented in Fig.3. These ﬁgures clearly
shows that the observed signiﬁcance ˆSc12 is an estimator of the initial signiﬁcance Sc12.
The distribution presented in Fig.4 shows the result of the full scanning in the case of the
observed signiﬁcance ˆScP and the initial signiﬁcance ScP .
The error of these estimators with a good accuracy obeys the standard normal distribution
(variance equals to 1). It can be conﬁrmed by the using of the Eqs.1-2 for pure background.
The results of the simulation of the signal absence (3000000 trials) are shown in Fig.5 (for
the estimator ˆSc12) and in Fig.6 (for the estimator ˆScP ).
Statement 1: The observed signiﬁcance (the case of the Poisson ﬂows of events)
is a realization of the random variable which can be approximated by
normal distribution with variance close to 1.

2 What is the Combining Signiﬁcance?

The Statement 1 allows us to determine the combinations of the several partial signif-
icances Si as combinations of independent normal distributed random variables by the
simple way.

Let us deﬁne the observed sum ˆSsum of partial signiﬁcances and the observed combining
signiﬁcance ˆScomb for the n observed partial signiﬁcances ˆSi with variances var(Si):

Statement 2: The ratio of the sum of the several observed partial signiﬁcances
and the standard deviation of this sum is the observed combining signiﬁcance
of several partial signiﬁcances. 1

In our case of Poisson ﬂows of events the variances of the considered signiﬁcances close
to 1. It means that the formula (Eq.4) is approximated by the formula

ˆScomb

ˆSsum

It also can be shown by Monte Carlo. Let us generate the observation of the signiﬁcances
ˆSc12 for four experiments with diﬀerent parameters Nb and Ns simultaneously. The results
of this simulation (30000 trials) for each experiment are presented in Fig.7. The distri-
bution of the sums of four observed signiﬁcances of experiments in each trial is shown in
Fig.8 (top). Correspondingly, the Fig.8 (bottom) presents the distribution of these sums
divided by √4 in each trials, i.e. the distribution of the observed combined signiﬁcances.

This property is correct also for another “counting” signiﬁcances ( ˆS1 =

3 Conclusion

The initial signiﬁcance is a parameter of the given measurement. The observed signiﬁ-
cance is a realization of the random variable. Also the observed signiﬁcance is the esti-
mator of the initial signiﬁcance. It means that we must consider the combinations of the
signiﬁcances as the combinations of the random variables with corresponding estimators.

1Note the additivity of observed combined signiﬁcances is not conserved. We must take into account
the number of partial signiﬁcances in each observed combined signiﬁcance for performance of the Eq.3.

Abstract

Correlation analysis is convenient and frequently used tool for investigation of time
series from complex systems. Recently new methods such as the multifractal detrended
ﬂuctuation analysis (MFDFA) and the wavelet transform modulus maximum method
(WTMM) have been developed. By means of these methods (i) we can investigate
long-range correlations in time series and (ii) we can calculate fractal spectra of these
time series. But opposite to the classical tool for correlation analysis - the autocor-
relation function, the newly developed tools are not applicable to all kinds of time
series. The unappropriate application of MFDFA or WTMM leads to wrong results
and conclusions. In this article we discuss the opportunities and risks connected to the
application of the MFDFA method to time series from a random number generator and
to experimentally measured time series (i) for accelerations of an agricultural tractor
and (ii) for the heartbeat activity of Drosophila melanogaster. Our main goal is to
emphasize on what can be done and what can not be done by the MFDFA as tool for
investigation of time series.

1 Introduction

The investigation of correlation properties is one of the ﬁrst tasks that a researcher of a time
series has to perform. The classical tool for this is the autocorrelation function which can
be calculated for stationary as well as for the nonstationary time series. The autocorrelation
function reﬂects the behaviour of the time series. If for an example a time series is periodic
its autocorrelation function is periodic too. For the most experimentally measured time
series however the correlation function decays and in simple systems this decay in the most
of the cases is exponential one. Opposite to this in numerous complex systems, which consist
of many interacting subsystems, the correlations decay with power law and are called long-
range because at large time scales the power law function is always large than the exponential
function.

The properties of the long-range correlations can be investigated by means of two recently
developed methods: WTMM and MFDFA. WTMM is based on the properties of the wavelets
[1, 2, 3, 4] and it leads to excellent results when the recorded time series are long enough.
For shorter time series (usually below 106 values) more convenient is the much simpler for
implementation MFDFA method based on the scaling properties of the so called ﬂuctuation
function. Below we shall discuss what can be done and what can not be done by the MFDFA
method when it is applied to diﬀerent kinds of time series. We use two kinds of experimentally
recorded time series (i) three short time series for the acceleration of an agricultural tractor
working in diﬀerent regimes and (ii) two time series for the heartbeat activity of Drosophila
melanogaster. In addition we shall investigate a time series obtained by a random numbers
generator in order to illustrate the monofractal properties of a time series.

The paper is organized as follows.

In the next section we discuss some multifractal
quantities and how they can be calculated by the MFDFA method. In section 3 we give
more information about the time series and analyze their autocorrelation functions.
In
section 4 we analyze the time series by means of the MFDFA method. Several concluding
remarks are summarized in the last section.

2 Generalized dimensions, fractal spectra, H¨older and

Hurst exponents

Let us have a set S which lies in an N−dimensional Cartesian space covered by a grid of
N-dimensional boxes of edge length ǫ. Let ǫ be small and we need N ∗(ǫ) boxes to cover our
set. The box-counting dimension of the set is

D0 is not an integer for some sets. These sets are called fractals. D0 is a member of the
spectrum of the Dq dimensions

where q is a continuous index and I(q, ǫ)

D0 = lim

is a sum over the N ∗ boxes of size ǫ which cover the set. µk is the natural measure i.e. it is a
measure of the frequency with which typical orbit visit various boxes covering the attractor
for the limit case when the length of the orbit goes to inﬁnity (in addition the frequencies
have to be the same for all initial conditions in the basin of attraction of the attractor except
for a set with Lebesque measure 0). Thus for µk we have

where ξ is the time the orbit originating from x0 spends in the cube ck in the time interval
0 ≤ t ≤ T . From (2) by means of the L‘Hospital rule we easy can obtain

µk = lim

D1 = lim

ln ǫ

D1 is called also information dimension. In general D0 ≥ D1 ≥ D2 ≥ . . .. If Dq varies with
q the measure, associated with Dq is called multifractal measure. The measure can have
diﬀerent behavior in each cube covering the set regardless of how small is its size ǫ. Thus
the dimension is not enough for a characterization of the measure and we need additional
characteristic quantities. One such quantity is the coarse-grained H¨older exponent for each
box

µ can have irregular behavior for diﬀerent boxes. When the box size decrease and µ has
statistically the same irregular behavior the measure is called self-similar [9]. For large class
of such measures α lies between αmin > 0 and αmax < ∞. For given ǫ we can count the
number Nǫ of the boxes with value of α in small interval around a prescribed value. Thus
we can deﬁne the coarse-grained spectrum

α =

ln µ(box)
ln ǫ

fǫ(α) ∝ −

ln Nǫ(α)
ln ǫ

From (7) we obtain Nǫ(α) ≈ ǫ−f (α), i.e. the relationship which has a form analogous to this
one for the dimension above. Thus f (α) can be treated as fractal dimension of the subsets
Sα of S having coarse grained H¨older exponent equal to α. If f (α) is not constant then for
small ǫ the set S is constructed by subsets Sα of diﬀerent dimensions f (α). Then the set S
is called multifractal.

The multifractals can be characterized by diﬀerent spectra. Below we shall obtain rela-
tionships for these spectra for the case ǫ → 0. We remember that the set S be covered by
grid of boxes of unit size ǫ and µ is the probability measure on S (µ(S) = 1). Let µ(ck) = µk
where ck denotes again the k−th cube. We have assigned a singularity measure αk to each
cube
(8)

µk = ǫαk

For small ǫ we can make continuous approximation for the number of cubes for which αk is
between α and α + dα, i.e., we can denote this number as

(9)

ρ(α)ǫ−f (α)dα

2

By substitution of (8) in the relationship for I(q, ǫ) and after a transition from a sum over
the boxes to an integration over the α we obtain

For small ǫ ln(1/ǫ) is large and the main contribution to the above integral is from the
neighborhood of the maximum value of the f (α∗) − qα∗. Let f (α∗) be smooth and the
maximum is located at α∗ = α(q) given by

N ∗(ǫ)

I(q, ǫ) =

ǫαkq =

dα∗ρ(α∗)ǫ−f (α∗)ǫqα∗

=

Xk=1
dα∗ρ(α∗) exp {[f (α∗) − qα∗] ln(1/ǫ)}

Z

=

Z

d

dα∗ [f (α∗) − qα∗] |α∗=α(q)= 0 →

dα∗ |α∗=α= q

d2
d(α∗)2 [f (α∗) − qα∗] |α∗=α(q)= 0 →

d2f
d(α∗)2 |α∗=α= q

Now we take the Taylor series representation of the function F (α∗, q) = f (α∗) − qα∗ around
the point α∗ = α(q) and substitute it in (10). The result is

I(q, ǫ) = exp {[ f (α(q)) − qα] ln(1/ǫ)}

dα∗ρ(α∗)ǫ−(1/2)f ′′ (α(q))(α∗ −α(q))2

Z

≈ exp {[ f (α(q)) − qα] ln(1/ǫ)}

Introducing (13) in (2) we obtain

Dq =

[qα(q) − f (α(q))]

q − 1

d
dq

[(q − 1)Dq] = α(q) =

f (α) = qα − τ (q) = q[α − h(q)] + 1

Thus for each q from (16) and (17) give α(q) and f (α) thus parametrically specifying the
function f (α). The Hurst exponent sometimes is associated with the coarse-grained H¨older
exponent for ǫ → 0. This can be done in the following way. For the cases in which the
following relationship holds

τ (q) = qh(q) − 1

But in which cases holds (18)? Let us consider stationary time series {xk}, k = 1, . . . , N and
let us use appropriate transformations in order to make all values positive and to normalize
the time series, i.e.,

In this case we can associate the time series with some probabilities and we shall use this
fact to derive (18). Let us construct the proﬁle function for our normalized time series

xk ≥ 0,

xk = 1

N

Xk=1

Yn =

(xk − hxi)

n

Xk=1

where hxi is the mean of the time series. Now we divide the time series into Ns segments of
length s and let for simplicity Ns = N/s is an integer. The sum

Y (νs) − Y ((ν − 1)s) =

(xk − hxi)

νs

Xk=(ν−1)s+1

for the segment ν is identical to the box probability ps(ν) which is the main building block
of the corresponding partition sum Zq(s) and scales with the τq spectrum

Zq(s) =

| ps(ν) |q∝ sτ (q)

N/s

Xν=1

From other side for our time series {xk} we can build a scaling function which contains the
local Hurst exponent. This is the sum

From here we obtain

and ﬁnally

| Y (νs) − Y ((ν − 1)s |q

| Y (νs) − Y ((ν − 1)s |q∝ sqh(q)

A comparison of (24) and (27) leads to (18).

The implementation of the MFDFA method [5] follows the steps below. The starting
point are our time series {xk} of ﬁnite length N. First of all we have to determine the proﬁle
function. Here we have to mention the following. There are two possibilities. First of all we
can use proﬁle function as in (22), i.e.,

Xk=1
The ﬁnal result of our analysis will be to obtain some values of the local Hurst exponent h.
If we use (28) as proﬁle function we can determine only positive Hurst exponents which are
not quite close to 0. In all other cases we have to use as proﬁle

i

Y (i) =

(xk − hxi)

ˆY (i) =

(Y (k) − hY i)

(24)

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

where Y (k) comes from (28). Thus we shall obtain value of local Hurst exponent which is
larger than the value of true exponent i.e.

(30)

ˆh(q) = 1 + h(q)

This is the ﬁnal diﬀerence between the two branches of the method. We shall present here
the ﬁrst branch, which has the same steps as the second with the only diﬀerence that we have
everywhere to change Y with ˆY if we want to obtain the algorithm for the second branch.
After the calculations of the proﬁle function we have to divide it into segments of length s.
As N/s in general is not an integer some part at the end of the time series will remain out
of the Ns = int(N/s) segments. In order to incorporate the inﬂuence of this part into the
analysis we divide the time series from the end to the beginning again to Ns segments of
length s. Thus we obtain 2Ns segments and for each segment calculate the local polynomial
trend yν(p), p = 1, . . . , s. The trend can be a polynomial of order m. Thus we perform
MFDFA of order m and the coeﬃcients of the polynom are obtained by a least-square ﬁt of
the corresponding segment. After the trend calculation we determine the variance

F 2(ν, s) =

{Y [(ν − 1)s + i] − yν(i)}2

for the segments ν = 1, 2, . . . , Ns. For the segments ν = Ns + 1, Ns + 2, . . . , 2Ns the variance
is

F 2(ν, s) =

{Y [N − (ν − Ns)s + i] − yν(i)}2

The next step is an averaging over the segments for obtaining the q-th order ﬂuctuation
function (q is in general a real number). For q = 0 the ﬂuctuation function is

For large class of time series the ﬂuctuation function has a power law behavior and from this
power law for large s we can determine the local Hurst exponent

3 The time series and their autocorrelation functions

In order to achieve our goals we have selected time series from three diﬀerent systems: an
agricultural tractor, time series from the heartbeat activity of the classical object of Genetics
-Drosophila melanosgaster and a time series from a random number generator in order to
illustrate the case of absence of correlations as well as the monofractal properties of some
time series. The investigated time series are shown in Fig. 1. We investigate two kinds
of experimental time series for acceleration of agricultural tractors. The time series from
panels (a) and (b) of Fig. 1 are from experimental modeling of the bouncing phenomenon.

and for q 6= 0

It arises when a machine travels on a rough road and consists of large-amplitude oscillations
which can lead to injuries of the driver, to a lift of the machine (some times more than
half-a-meter over the surface) and to damage of some of its elements. The time series for
this phenomenon are recorded when the tractor moved on artiﬁcial rough road, consisting
of 12 small kinks prepared on am asphalted surface. For this case we have several large
amplitude oscillations when the tractor moves on the rough part of the road and in some
time series we have also the noise background when the tractor moves on the smooth part
of the road. Thus we can discuss these time series as time series of noise with superimposed
periodic trend. The time series from panel (c) of Fig. 1 are recorded when the tractor has
a construction exhibiting impact properties. This case has been chosen because the impact
systems are frequent source of chaotic vibrations [6], [7]. The tractor has been converted
to an impact system by adding vibrating subsoiler to it. The soil cutting chiesel breaks a
hard soil layer located at the depth between 30 and 50 cm from the ﬁeld surface and it is
oscillated in order to reduce the draft force and to improve the water inﬁltration into the
soil. The oscillation is realized by a hydravlic power cylinder with two lift arms. This work
mode is called ground-penetrating mode.

The time series in panels (d) and (e) of Fig. 1 are records of the heartbeat activity of
Drosophila melanogaster These ﬂies are provided by Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center,
U.S.A. The time series are ECGs (electrocardiogramms) for the ﬁrst generation (the kids)
obtained by male Dopa decarboxilase (Ddc) mutant (FBgn 0000422) located in chromosome
2, locus 37C1, crossed with female shibire (shi) (FBgn 0003392) located in chromosome 1,
locus 13F7-12. Ddc codes for an enzyme necessary for the synthesis of four neurotransmitters:
norepinephrine, dopamine, octopamine, serotonin, related to learning and memory. The
shibire (shi) mutants cause paralysis at high temperature and eliminates the eﬀect of the
neurotransmitters on the heart. The ECGs have been recorded optically at a stage P1
(white puparium) of a Drosophila development when it is both immobile and transparent
and the dorsal vessel is easily viewed. The object was placed on a glass slide in a drop
of distilled water under a microscope (magniﬁcation 350 x). Fluctuation in light intensity
due to movement of the dorsal vessel tissue was captured by photocells ﬁtted to the one
eyepiece of the microscope. The captured analogue signal was then digitized at 1 kHz
sampling rate by data acquisition card and LabVIEW data capturing software supplied
by National Instruments. Finally the time series from the random number generator are
obtained by means of the generator ran2 from [10]. In Fig. 2 are presented the autocorrelation
functions for the investigated time series. The large amplitude oscillations in panels (a) and
(b) reﬂect the bouncing phenomenon. The impact oscillations are clearly reﬂected by the
almost periodic behaviour of the autocorrelation function in panel (c). The slowly decaying
autocorrelations for the ECGs of Drosophila show some degree of anticorrelation at large
n. Finally as it can be expected the time series from the random number generator are
uncorrelated.

4 Fractal analysis of the time series

Excluding the time series from the random number generator which are uncorrelated, the
other time series exhibit some degree of long range correlations. Below we shall discuss the
question how far these correlations can be investigated by means of the modern methods
such as the MFDFA. In order to answer this question we have to look at the ﬂuctuation

6

functions connected to the time series. We shall calculate the ﬂuctuation functions directly
on the basis of the time series for the cases of tractor accelerations and for the time series
from the random number generator. For the time series from Drosophila we ﬁrst shall
construct the time series for the intermaxima intervals (the time series for the time between
two consequent maxima of the time series) and for the intermaxima time series we shall
calculate the ﬂuctuation functions and eventually the characteristic fractal quantities. The
results are shown in Fig. 3. For the time series for the acceleration of the tractor in bouncing
regime we can not apply the MFDFA method. The reason is that these time series (shown
in panels (a) and (b) in Fig. 1) are too short and we can not divide them in large number of
segments in order to have enough statistics for correct calculation of the ﬂuctuation function.
In order to apply the MFDFA the time series must have at least two thousand values. The
minimum number of values - 4000 for which the ﬂuctuation function is calculated here are
the time series for the acceleration of the tractor in impact regime. The ﬂuctuation function
is not a straight line on a log-log scale - it has a kink as a reﬂection of periodicity of the time
series. Thus these time series do not show scaling behaviour and we can not calculate the
fractal spectra for them. On the other side we conﬁrm the observation [8] that the periodic
behaviour inﬂuences the ﬂuctuation function. On panels (b) and (c) of Fig. 3 are presented
the ﬂuctuation functions for the intermaxima intervals of Drosophila. On panel (b) the
ﬂuctuation function is close to a straight line, i.e., the scaling properties can be assumed
and the multifractal spectra can be calculated. Not so clear is the situation in panel (c).
We shall carry further the calculations for this case in order to see how the not very large
deviations from the scaling behaviour inﬂuence the form of the fractal spectra. The best
scaling properties are exhibited by the time series from the random number generator -
panel (d). This can be expected as these time series are specially selected for illustration of
monofractal behaviour. Thus for calculation of the fractal characteristics from the initial 6
time series the requirements for length and presence of scaling properties have eliminated 3
time series. The h(q) spectra for the remaining three time series are presented in Fig. 4.
The expected behaviour of such kind of spectrum is presented in panel (a) where h decreases
with increasing q. This multifractal behaviour reﬂects the scaling properties of the time
series as shown in panel (b) of Fig. 3. Multifractal behaviour is exhibited also by the second
time series for the intermaxima intervals of Drosophila melanogaster shown in panel (b) of
Fig. 4. As it can be seen from panel (c) of Fig. 4 for the time series from the random
number generator h is a constant for all q which is characteristic feature for the monofractal
behaviour.

Finally we calculate the f (α) spectra. For the time series from the random number
generator this spectrum is a point and it is not presented in Fig. 5. Panel (a) shows the
spectrum for the time series with scaling properties shown in panel (b) of Fig. 3. The
expected form for the f (α) spectrum is parabolic one. This form is observed on panel
(a) of Fig. 5. The maximum of the f (α) spectrum shows at which α is positioned the
most statistically signiﬁcant part of the time series, i.e., the subsets with maximum fractal
dimension among all subsets of the time series. In our case fmax = 1 at α = 0.652. These
and other characteristics of the f (α) spectrum (such as its width at some value kfmax,
0 < k < 1) can be used as tools for classiﬁcation of time series with multifractal properties.
The consequences of not fully scaling properties of the time series from panel (c) of Fig. 3 are
observed in panel (b) of Fig. 5 where the parabolic form of the spectrum is slightly deformed.
As such a form is diﬀerent from the form for which we can make quantitative conclusions
we can use such spectra only for qualitative conclusions and classiﬁcations. From the point

7

of view of genetics the diﬀerent spectra correspond to the diﬀerent genetic characteristics
which the ﬂies from the ﬁrst generation obtained from the parents with diﬀerent genetic
heart defects. Thus only on the basis of the ECGs we can conclude that the two investigated
Drosophila ﬂies are aﬀected in diﬀerent way by the genetic defects of their parents. Thus the
heartbeat dynamics of Drosophila is connected to its genetics. This conclusion opens the way
for further intensive research on the relation between (i) the biomechanical properties of the
heart of simple and more complex animals and humans and (ii) their genetic speciﬁcations.

5 Concluding remarks

In this paper we demonstrate the possibilities and risks when the multifractal detrended
ﬂuctuation analysis is applied to experimentally obtained time series. We have started with
six time series from which only one was carefully selected in order to demonstrate monofractal
and irregular behaviour. Then step by step we have demonstrated how the requirements of
the method stop the investigation of diﬀerent time series at diﬀerent points as follows. The
requirement for length was not satisﬁed by the time series for the acceleration of the tractor
in bouncing regime. The investigation of the time series for the tractor acceleration in impact
regime was stopped at the point where the requirement for scaling of the ﬂuctuation function
was imposed. At this point we allowed us to make a relative crude approximation for scaling
properties of one of the time series for the heartbeat activity of Drosophila. The above crude
approximation has the consequences in the multifractal spectra and especially in the f (α)
spectra. The monofractality of time series was clearly illustrated by the h(q) spectrum of
the time series from the random number generator. Finally the f (α) spectra have shown
that the prescribed form of the spectrum for the multifractal behaviour can be assigned to
only one of the six time series.

In conclusion we warn the researcher to be very careful when he or she applies the MFDFA
to time series from real systems. Only small number of them are appropriate for such
analysis. But when this analysis can be performed it can supply us with much quantitative
and qualitative information about the relations between (i) the observed dynamics of the
investigated complex system and (ii) the usually not visible processes, responsible for this
dynamics.

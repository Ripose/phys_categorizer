Uncovering the hidden regularities and organizational principles of networks arising in

physical systems ranging from the molecular level to the scale of large communication

infrastructures is the key issue for the understanding of their fabric and dynamical prop-

erties 1,2,3,4,5. The “rich-club” phenomenon refers to the tendency of nodes with high cen-

trality, the dominant elements of the system, to form tightly interconnected communities

and it is one of the crucial properties accounting for the formation of dominant communi-

ties in both computer and social sciences 4,5,6,7,8. Here we provide the analytical expression

and the correct null models which allow for a quantitative discussion of the rich-club phe-

nomenon. The presented analysis enables the measurement of the rich-club ordering and

its relation with the function and dynamics of networks in examples drawn from the bio-

logical, social and technological domains.

Recently, the informatics revolution has made possible the analysis of a wide range of large

scale, rapidly evolving networks such as transportation, technological, social and biological

networks 1,2,3,4,5. While these networks are extremely different from each other in their func-

tion and attributes, the analysis of their fabric provided evidence of several shared regularities,

suggesting general and common self-organizing principles beyond the speciﬁc details of the

individual systems. In this context, the statistical physics approach has been exploited as a very

1

Colizza et al.

convenient strategy because of its deep connection with statistical graph theory and because of

its power to quantitatively characterize macroscopic phenomena in terms of the microscopic dy-

namics of the various systems 1,2,3,4,9. As an initial discriminant of structural ordering, attention

has been focused on the networks’ degree distribution; i.e., the probability P (k) that any given

node in the network shares an edge with k neighboring nodes. This function is, however, only

one of the many statistics characterizing the structural and hierarchical ordering of a network;

a full account of the connectivity pattern calls for the detailed study of the multi-point degree

correlation functions and/or opportune combination of these.

In this paper, we tackle a main structural property of complex networks, the so-called “rich-

club” phenomenon. This property has been discussed in several instances in both social and

computer sciences and refers to the tendency of high degree nodes, the hubs of the network, to

be very well connected to each other. Essentially, nodes with a large number of links - usually

referred to as rich nodes - are much more likely to form tight and well interconnected subgraphs

(clubs) than low degree nodes. A ﬁrst quantitative deﬁnition of the rich-club phenomenon is

given by the rich-club coefﬁcient φ, introduced by Zhou and Mondragon in the context of the

Internet 7. Denoting by E>k the number of edges among the N>k nodes having degree higher

than a given value k, the rich-club coefﬁcient is expressed as:

φ(k) =

2E>k
N>k(N>k − 1)

,

(1)

where N>k(N>k − 1)/2 represents the maximum possible number of edges among the N>k

nodes. Therefore, φ(k) measures the fraction of edges actually connecting those nodes out of

the maximum number of edges they might possibly share. The rich club coefﬁcient is a novel

probe for the topological correlations in a complex network, and it yields important information

about its underlying architecture. Structural properties, in turn, have immediate consequences

on network’s features and tasks, such as e.g. robustness, performance of biological functions, or

selection of trafﬁc backbones, depending on the system at hand. In a social context, for example,

a strong rich-club phenomenon indicates the dominance of an “oligarchy” of highly connected

and mutually communicating individuals, as opposed to a structure comprised of many loosely

2

Colizza et al.

connected and relatively independent sub-communities. In the Internet, such a feature would

point to an architecture in which important hubs are much more densely interconnected than

peripheral nodes in order to provide the transit backbone of the network 7.

It is also worth

stressing that the rich club phenomenon is not trivially related to the mixing properties of net-

works, which enable the distinction between assortative networks, where large degree nodes

preferentially attach to large degree nodes, and disassortative networks, showing the opposite

tendency 10,11,12. Indeed, the rich club phenomenon is not necessarily associated to assortative

mixing. In the top panel of Fig. 1, we sketch a simple construction in which a disassortative

network is exhibiting the rich club phenomenon. In other words, the rich club phenomenon and

the mixing properties express different features that are not trivially related or derived one from

each other (the technical discussion of this point is reported in the methods section).

In Fig. 1, we report the behavior of the rich club coefﬁcient as a function of the degree in

a variety of real world networks drawn from the biological, social and technological world. In

Table 1, we summarize the basic topological features of these networks and the datasets used.

We also consider three standard network models: the Erd¨os-R´enyi (ER) graph 22, the generalized

random network having a heavy-tailed degree distribution obtained with the Molloy-Reed (MR)

algorithm 23, and the Barabasi-Albert (BA) model 24. In the ER graph, N nodes are connected by

E edges randomly chosen with probability p out of the N(N −1)/2 possible pairs of nodes. The

MR network is obtained starting from a given degree sequence P (k) (in our case P (k) ∼ k−γ

with γ = 3) by randomly connecting nodes with the constraints of avoiding self-loops and

multiple edges. The BA model is generated by using the growing algorithm of Ref. 24 that

produces a scale-free graph with power-law degree sequence with exponent γ = 3. In all cases,
the generated networks have N = 105 vertices and an average degree hki = 6.

As is evident from Fig. 1, the monotonic increasing of φ(k) is a feature shared by all the

analyzed datasets. This behavior is claimed to provide evidence of the rich-club phenomenon

since φ(k) progressively increases in vertices with increasing degree (e.g., see Ref. 7 for the In-

ternet case, where a different representation of the function is adopted with φ deﬁned in terms

3

Colizza et al.

of the rank r of nodes sorted by decreasing degree values). However, a monotonic increase

of φ(k) does not necessarily implies the presence of the rich-club phenomenon. Indeed, even

in the case of the ER graph - a completely random network - we ﬁnd an increasing rich-club

coefﬁcient. This implies that the increase of φ(k) is a natural consequence of the fact that ver-

tices with large degree have a larger probability of sharing edges than low degree vertices. This

feature is therefore imposed by construction and does not represent a signature of any particular

organizing principle or structure, as is clear in the ER case. The simple inspection of the φ(k)

trend is therefore potentially misleading in the discrimination of the rich-club phenomenon.

In order to ﬁnd opportune baselines for the detection of the rich-club phenomenon we focus

on the theoretical analysis of φ(k). In the methods section we derive an expression for the rich

club coefﬁcient as a function of the convolution of the two vertices degree correlation function

P (k, k′). Interestingly, it is possible to obtain an explicit expression for the rich-club coefﬁcient

of random uncorrelated networks. In this case, the two-vertices correlation function is a simple

function of the degree distribution, yielding the following behavior for uncorrelated large size

networks at large degrees:

φunc(k)

∼

k,kmax→∞

k2
hkiN

,

(2)

where kmax is the maximum degree present in the network. Eq.(2) shows unequivocally that the

rich-club coefﬁcient is also a monotonically increasing function for uncorrelated networks, so

that, in order to assess the presence of rich-club structural ordering, it is necessary to compare

it with the one obtained from the appropriate null model with the same degree distribution, thus

providing a suitable normalization of φ(k).

From the previous discussion, a possible choice for the normalization of the rich-club coefﬁ-

cient is provided by the ratio ρunc(k) = φ(k)/φunc(k), where φunc(k) is analytically calculated

by inserting in Eq. (4), reported in the methods section, the network’s degree distribution P (k).

A ratio larger than one is the actual evidence for the presence of a rich-club phenomenon lead-

ing to an increase in the interconnectivity of large degree nodes in a more pronounced way than

4

Colizza et al.

in the random case. On the contrary, a ratio ρunc(k) < 1 is a signature of an opposite organizing

principle that leads to a lack of interconnectivity among large degree nodes. On the other hand,

a completely degree-degree uncorrelated network with ﬁnite size is not always realizable due to

structural constraints. Indeed, any ﬁnite size random network presents a structural cut-off value

ks over which the requirement of the lack of dangling edges introduces the presence of multi-

ple and self-connections and/or degree-degree correlations 21,25. Networks with bounded degree
distributions and ﬁnite second moment hk2i present a kmax that is below the structural one ks.

In this situation, φunc(k) is properly deﬁned for all degrees and is representative of the network

topology. However, in networks with heavy-tailed degree distribution (e.g., scale-free degree

distributions with 2 < γ ≤ 3, as observed in many real systems), this is no longer the case and

ks is generally smaller than kmax. In fact, structural degree-degree correlations and higher order

effects, such as the emergence of large cliques 26, set in even in completely random networks.

The normalization of φ(k) that takes into account these effects is provided by the expression

ρran(k) = φ(k)/φran(k), where φran(k) is the rich-club coefﬁcient of the maximally random

network with the same degree distribution P (k) of the network under study. Operatively, the

maximally random network can be thought of as the stationary ensemble of networks visited by

a process that, at any time step, randomly selects a couple of links of the original network and

exchange two of their ending points (automatically preserving the degree distribution). Also in

this case an actual rich-club ordering is denoted by a ratio ρran(k) > 1. Therefore, whereas

ρunc(k) provides information about the overall rich-club ordering in the network with respect to

an ideally uncorrelated graph, ρran(k) is a normalized measure which discounts the structural

correlations due to unavoidable ﬁnite size effects, providing a better discrimination of the actual

presence of the rich club-phenomenon due to the ordering principles shaping the network.

In Fig. 2, we report the ratios ρran(k) for the real world and the simulated networks. The

analysis clearly discriminates between networks with or without rich-club ordering. In partic-

ular, we identify a strong rich-club ordering in the Scientiﬁc Collaboration Network, providing

support to the idea that the elite formed by more inﬂuential scientists tends to form collaborative

5

Colizza et al.

groups within speciﬁc domains. This also supports the view that the rich-club phenomenon is

a natural tendency in many social networks. We ﬁnd a clearly opposite result in the decreasing

behavior of the rich club spectrum for the Protein Interaction Network and the Internet map

at the Autonomous System level. In both cases, this evidence provides interesting information

regarding the system structure and function.

The lack of rich-club ordering in the Protein Interaction Network indicates that proteins

with large number of interactions are presiding over different functions and thus, in general,

are coordinating speciﬁc functional modules (whose detailed analysis requires speciﬁc tools 27).

Figure 3 shows portions of the Protein Interaction Network and the Scientiﬁc Collaboration

Network including the club of N>k nodes – N>k = 29 and N>k = 35 for the Protein Intera-

tions, N>k = 30 and N>k = 36 for the Scientiﬁc Collaboration – and the connections among

them. The network representations clearly show the presence of a rich-club phenomenon in the

Scientiﬁc Collaboration Network, where the majority of rich nodes are highly interconnected

forming tight subgraphs, in contrast with the Protein Interaction Network case, where only few

links appear to connect rich nodes, the rest linking to lower degree vertices.

In the case of the Internet, the appropriate analysis of the rich-club phenomenon shows

that, contrary to previous claims 7, the structure at the Autonomous System level lacks rich-club

ordering. This might appear counter-intuitive. It is reasonable to imagine the Internet backbone

made of interconnected transit providers which are also local hubs. This is however not the

case and an explanation can be easily found in the fact that we are just considering topological

properties.

Indeed, the backbone hubs are identiﬁed more in terms of their bandwidth and

trafﬁc capacity than in terms of the sole number of connections. The present result suggests

that high degree hubs provide connectivity to local region of the Internet and are not tightly

interconnected. The backbone of interconnected transit providers is instead identiﬁed by high

trafﬁc links which play a crucial role in terms of trafﬁc capacities but whose number might

represent a small fraction of the total possible number of interconnections.

The previous discussion points out that, in some cases, the concept of rich-club ordering

6

Colizza et al.

should be generalized in order to evaluate the richness of vertices not just in terms of their de-

gree but in terms of the actual trafﬁc or intensity of interactions handled. In this case, we have to

consider a weighted network representation of the system where a weight wij representing the

trafﬁc or intensity of interaction is associated to each edge between the vertices i and j. Also

in this case, however, the study of the weighted rich-club coefﬁcient alone does not discrimi-

nate the actual presence of the rich club effect (see Methods). Given the entanglement of the

weight and degree correlations, the appropriate null hypothesis is however more complicated to

deﬁne and a detailed account of the evaluation of the weighted rich-club effect will be provided

elsewhere.

In summary, the presented analysis provides the baseline functions for the detection of the

rich-club phenomenon and its effect on the structure of large scale networks. This allows the

measurement of this effect in a wide range of systems, ﬁnally enabling a quantitative discussion

of various claims such as “high centrality” backbones in technological networks and “elitarian”

clubs in social systems.

Methods

Analytic expression of the rich club coefﬁcient. The basic analytical understanding of the

rich-club phenomenon starts by considering the quantity Ekk′, representing the total number of

edges between vertices of degree k and of degree k′ for k 6= k′, and twice the number of edges

between vertices in the same degree class. We can express the numerator of φ(k) in Eq. 1 as

2E>k =

kmax
k

dk′

kmax
k

dk′′Ek′k′′, where kmax is the maximum degree present in the network

and where, for the sake of simplicity, the variable k is thought of as continuous. In turn, the

R

quantity Ekk′ can be expressed as a function of the joint degree probability distribution 11,21,28,29

via the identity NhkiP (k, k′) = Ekk′, yielding

From Eq. (3), it is clear that φ(k) is also a measure of correlations in the network, although

i h

7

Colizza et al.

it represents a different projection of P (k, k′) as compared to other degree-degree correlation

measures. At the same time, it is possible to see that the rich-club coefﬁcient express a property

that is not trivially related to the usual indicators of assortative behavior, such as the Pearson’s

correlation coefﬁcient 11 or the average nearest neighbor degree 10. Notice that these assortativity

measures quantify two-point correlations and so account for quasi-local properties of the nodes

in the network, whereas the rich club phenomenon is computed as a global feature within a

restricted subset. The double integral is indeed a convolution of the correlation function that

allows the presence of different combinations of the assortative and rich-club features in the

same network.

Only in the case of random uncorrelated networks 3,4,29, the joint degree distribution P (k, k′)
factorizes and takes the simple form Punc(k, k′) = kk′P (k)P (k′)/hki2. By inserting this ex-

pression into Eq. (3), we obtain φ(k) for uncorrelated networks as

φunc(k) =

Rich club coefﬁcient for weighted networks. If the rich-club is deﬁned as the set of nodes

having a strength larger than a given value s, a possible deﬁnition of the weighted rich-club

coefﬁcient can be expressed as

φw(s) =

2W>s
i|si>s si

,

where W>s represents the sum of the weights on the links connecting two nodes in the club and
P

the normalization is given by the sum of the strengths of the rich nodes.

Table 1: Basic topological properties of the analyzed datasets. We considered four real

world networks: (1) the Protein Interaction Network 12,13 of the yeast Saccharomyces Cere-

visiae collected with different experimental techniques and documented at the Database of In-

teracting Proteins (http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/); (2) the Scientiﬁc Collaboration Network 14,15

extracted from the electronic database e-Print Archive in the area of condensed matter physics

(http://xxx.lanl.gov/archive/cond-mat/), from 1995 to 1998, in which nodes represent scientists

and a connection exists if they coauthored at least one paper in the archive; (3) the network

of Worldwide Air Transportation 16,17 representing the International Air Transport Association

(http://www.iata.org/) database of airport pairs connected by direct ﬂights for the year 2002;

(4) the Internet network at the Autonomous System 4 level 4,10,18,19,20 from data collected by the

Oregon Route Views project (http://www.routeviews.org/) in May 2001, in which nodes repre-

sent Internet service providers and edges connections among those. The sizes of the networks

in number of nodes and edges are shown, along with the average degree hki and the maximum

degree value kmax. We also give the value for the corresponding structural cut-off, ks, in the

uncorrelated case 21.

Figure Legends

Figure 1: Schematic picture of the rich-club phenomenon and rich-club spectrum φ(k)

for real networks. At the top, a conceptual example of disassortative network displaying the

presence of the rich-club phenomenon is shown. Disassortative mixing is given by the tendency

of hubs to be on average more likely connected to low degree nodes. However, the four rich

nodes represented in the schematic picture show a clear rich-club behavior by forming a fully

connected clique within the club. At the bottom, results for the four real-world networks and

the three models analyzed are shown. The computer generated networks - ER, MR, and BA -
have size N = 105 and average degree hki = 6. ER refers to the Erd¨os-R´enyi graph, MR is

12

Colizza et al.

constructed from the Molloy-Reed algorithm with a given degree distribution P (k) ∼ k−3, and

the BA model is generated by growing a network with preferential attachment that produces a

scale-free graph with power-law degree sequence with exponent γ = 3. Results are averaged
over n = 102 different realizations for each model. All networks share a monotonic increasing

behavior of φ(k), independent of the nature of the degree distribution characterizing the network

and of the possible presence of underlying structural organization principles. Also random

networks, either having a Poissonian degree distribution (such as ER) or a heavy-tailed P (k)

(such as MR and BA), show a rich club spectrum increasing with increasing values of the degree.

This common trend is indeed due to an intrinsic feature of every network structure, for which

hubs have simply a larger probability of being more interconnected than low degree nodes.

Figure 2: Assessment for the presence of the rich-club phenomenon in the networks under

study. φ(k) is compared to the null hypothesis provided by the maximally random network with

φran(k). The ratio ρran = φ/φran is plotted as a function of the degree k and compared to the

baseline value equal to 1. If ρ(k) > 1 (< 1) the network displays the presence (absence) of

the rich-club phenomenon with respect to the random case. The Protein Interaction Network,

the Internet map at the Autonomous System level and the Scientiﬁc Collaboration Network

show clear behaviors as explained in the main text. The Worldwide Air Transportation network

displays a mild rich-club ordering with ρran(k) > 1. The ER and MR network models show

a ratio ρran(k) = 1 ∀k, as expected, whereas the BA model exhibits a mixing behavior with

values above 1 for very high degrees.

Figure 3: Graph representations of the rich-clubs. Progressively smaller clubs of N>k rich

nodes in the Protein Interaction Network -top- and in the Scientiﬁc Collaboration Network -

bottom- are shown together with the E>k connections among them. Here N>k = 35, E>k = 37

(top left) and N>k = 29, E>k = 21 (top right) for the Protein Interactions; Nk> = 36, E>k =

62 (bottom left) and Nk> = 30, E>k = 54 (bottom right) for the collaboration network. The

two graph representations for each network show progressively smaller clubs made of N>k

rich nodes for increasing values of the degree k. The links connecting the rich nodes to the

13

Colizza et al.

rest of the network are not represented for sake of simplicity. The Protein Interaction Net-

work shows a club whose hubs are relatively independent being loosely connected among each

other, leaving the remaining links to coordinate speciﬁc functional modules. A different pic-

ture is observed in the Scientiﬁc Collaborations case, where most of the hubs form cliques and

tightly interconnected subgraphs, thus revealing the tendency of scientists to form densely in-

terconnected collaborative groups. The graphs have been produced with the Pajek software

(http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/pajek/).

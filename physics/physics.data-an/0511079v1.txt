Abstract

Time series of heartbeat activity of humans can exhibit long-range correlations.
In this paper we show that such kind of correlations can exist for the heartbeat
activity of much simpler species like Drosophila melanogaster. By means of the
method of multifractal detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (MFDFA) we calculate frac-
tal spectra f (α) and h(q) and investigate the correlation properties of heartbeat
activity of Drosophila with genetic hearth defects for three consequent generations
of species. We observe that opposite to the case of humans the time series of the
heartbeat activity of healtly Drosophila do not have scaling properties. Time series
from ﬂies with genetic defects can be long-range correllated and can have multifrac-
tal properties. The fractal heartbeat dynamics of Drosophila is transferred from
generation to generation.

1 Introduction

The irregular and complex structure of the time series (ECG) of human heartbeat dynam-
ics is an object of considerable clinical and research interest [1], [2], [3]. This structure is
connected not only to the external and internal perturbations but also depends on the syn-
ergetic action of muscle and nervous systems which inﬂuences the correlation properties
of the time series. In many simple systems the correlation function of the measured time
series usually decays exponentially with the time. In complex systems the correlations
can decay with power law and because no characteristic scale is associated with the power
law such systems are called scale-free. Their correlations are called long-range because at
large time scales the power law function is always larger than the exponential function.
Below we are interested in the presence of long-range correlations in the time series for
heartbeat activity of Drosophila melanogaster - the classical object of Genetics. Due to

the short reproduction cycle of Drosophila we can investigate the correlation properties
of the heartbeat dynamics for three consequent generations. This allows us to study the
relation between genetic properties of Drosophila and correlation properties of the time
series of its heartbeat activity.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we describe the investigated system,
recording of the time series and quantities used for their analysis. The analysis of the
obtained fractal spectra is performed in Sect.3 . Some concluding remarcs are summarized
in the last section.

2 System and methods

We investigate time series of the heart activity (ECG) of Drosophila melanogaster ob-
tained from mutant ﬂies and wild type controls provided by Bloomington Drosophila
Stock Center, U.S.A. We crossed male Dopa decarboxilase (Ddc) mutant (FBgn 0000422
located in chromosome 2, locus 37C1) and female shibire (shi) (FBgn 0003392 located in
chromosome 1, locus 13F7-12). The Ddc mutants’ heartbeat rate is about 60 % of the
normal one. Ddc codes for an enzyme necessary for the synthesis of four neurotransmit-
ters: norepinephrine, dopamine, octopamine, serotonin, related to learning and memory.
The shibire (shi) mutants cause paralysis at high temperature. They code for the pro-
tein dynamin, necessary for the endocytosis. Its damaging at high temperature stops the
transmission of the impulse through the synapses, causes paralysis, and eliminates the
eﬀect of the neurotransmitters on the heart [4]. ECGs were taken from three consequent
generations of species. Drosophila heartbeat was recorded optically and digitalized. Opti-
cal ECG records were taken at a stage P1 (white puparium) of a Drosophila development
when it is both immobile and transparent and the dorsal vessel is easily viewed. The
object was placed on a glass slide in a drop of distilled water under a microscope (magni-
ﬁcation 350 x). Fluctuation in light intensity due to movement of the dorsal vessel tissue
was captured by photocells ﬁtted to the one eyepiece of the microscope. The captured
analogue signal was then digitized at 1 kHz sampling rate by data acquisition card and
LabVIEW data capturing software supplied by National Instruments. 600000 data points
were taken for each sample.

The obtained time series are analysed by the multifractal formalism which is widely
used in mathematics, physics, and biology [1], [5], [6], [7], [8]. The investigation is based
on the spectrum h(q) of the local Hurst exponent and on the fractal spectrum f (α) [9, 10].
Let us consider a set of points which lies in an N−dimensional Cartesian space covered
by a grid of N-dimensional cubes of edge length ǫ. If for small ǫ we need N ∗(ǫ) cubes to
cover our set we can deﬁne the spectrum of generalized dimensions

Dq =

ln(1/ǫ)

I(q, ǫ) =

where q is a continuous index. µk is the natural measure, i.e., it is a measure of the fre-
quency with which a typical orbit visits various cubes covering the investigated attracting
set of points for the limit case when the length of the orbit goes to inﬁnity (in addition

2

the frequences have to be the same for all initial conditions in the basin of attraction of
the attractor except for a set with Lebesque measure 0). Thus for µk we have

where ξ is the time the orbit originating from x0 spends in the cube ck in the time interval
0 ≤ t ≤ T . D0 is called capacity of the set and it is not integer for some sets. From (1)
by means of the L‘Hospital rule we can easily obtain

µk = lim
T →∞

ξ(ck, x0, T )
T

,

D1 = lim

ǫ→0 P

N ∗
k=1(ǫ)µi ln µi
ln ǫ

D1 is called also information dimension (as it measures how the information is scaled with
ln(1/ǫ)). In general D0 ≥ D1 ≥ D2 ≥ . . .. If Dq varies with q the measure, associated
with Dq is called multifractal measure.

Let a set S be covered with a grid of cubes of unit size ǫ and µ is the probability
measure on S (µ(S) = 1). Let µ(ck) = µk where ck denotes again the k−th cube. We can
assign a singularity measure αk to each cube

µk = ǫαk

For small ǫ we can make continuous approximation for the number of cubes for which αk
is between α and α + dα, i.e., we can denote this number as ρ(α)ǫ−f (α)dα. Substituting
(4) in the relationship for I(q, ǫ) and after a transition from a sum over the cubes to an
integration over the α we obtain

N ∗(ǫ)

I(q, ǫ) =

ǫαkq = Z

dα∗ρ(α∗)ǫ−f (α∗)ǫqα∗

=

Xk=1
dα∗ρ(α∗) exp {[f (α∗) − qα∗] ln(1/ǫ)}

=

Z

For small ǫ ln(1/ǫ) is large and the main contribution to the above integral is from the
neighborhood of the maximum value of the f (α∗) − qα∗. Let f (α∗) be smooth. The
maximum is located at α∗ = α(q) given by

d

dα∗ [f (α∗) − qα∗] |α∗=α(q)= 0 →

df
dα∗ |α∗=α= q

d2
d(α∗)2 [f (α∗) − qα∗] |α∗=α(q)= 0 →

d2f
d(α∗)2 |α∗=α= q

Now we take the Taylor series representation of the function F (α∗, q) = f (α∗) − qα∗
around the point α∗ = α(q) and substitute it in (5). The result is

I(q, ǫ) = exp {[ f (α(q)) − qα] ln(1/ǫ)} ×
dα∗ρ(α∗)ǫ−(1/2)f ′′ (α(q))(α∗−α(q))2

≈ exp {[ f (α(q)) − qα] ln(1/ǫ)}

Using (6) we obtain

,

For each q from (11) and (12) we can obtain α(q) and f (α) thus parametrically specifying
the function f (α). And α can be connected to the local Hurst exponent by means of the
relationships

α = h(q) + q

f (α) = q[α − h(q)] + 1

(13)

Thus obtaining the h(q) spectrum we can obtain also α and f (α) spectra by means of
(13).

For calculation of h from the heartbeat time series we can use the method of multifrac-
tal detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (MFDFA) or the more complex wavelet transform mod-
ulus maxima method (WTMM), initially developed for investigation of quasi-singularities
of turbulent signals (for applications of this method see [11, 12], [13], [14], [15], [16]). In
this paper we shall use the MFDFA method which realization is as follows [17]. First of
all we have to calculate the proﬁle function Yi. For this we calculate the mean hxi of the
investigated time series {xk} and use it to obtain the proﬁle function

Yi =

(xk − hxi),

i = 1, 2, . . . , N.

Xk=1

The following step is to divide the time series into segments and to calculate the variation
for each segment. The division is into Ns =int(N/s) segments and because the obtained
segments would not include some data at the end of the investigated time series, additional
Ns segments are added, which start from the last value of the sequence in the direction
to the ﬁrst value of sequence.

In order to calculate the variation we have to calculate the local trend (the ﬁtting
polynomial yν(i) for each segment of length s, where s is between an appropriate minimum
and maximum value). Then the variations are deﬁned as

F 2(ν, s) =

{Y [(ν − 1)s + i] − yν(i)}2

for the ﬁrst Ns segments and

F 2(ν, s) =

{Y [N − (ν − N)s + i] − yν(i)}2

Fq(s) = {[1/(2Ns)]

[F 2(ν, s)]q/2}1/q.

(17)

2Ns

Xν=1

The scaling properties of Fq(s) determine the kind of fractal characteristics of the time
series. For monofractal time series Fq(s) scales as s of constant power h for each q. For
sequences of random numbers this constant h has the value 1/2. Even in presence of
local correlations extending up to a characteristic range s∗ the exponent h = 1/2 would
be unchanged when s >> s∗. If the correlations do not have characteristic lengths the
exponent h would be diﬀerent from 1/2.

The procedure described above is appopriate for determination of positive Hurst ex-
ponents which are not very close to zero. For close to zero or negative exponents we have
to add a step after the calculation of the proﬁle function namely to calculate the proﬁle
function of the proﬁle function Y

Y ∗
i =

i

Xk=1

[Y (k) − hY i]

and the function Y ∗
should be used further in the MFDFA procedure. The result is
i
that if there is a scaling in the ﬂuctuation function this scaling is connected to the Hurst
exponent as

F ∗
q (s) ∝ sh(q)+1
In our investigation below we use MFDFA(1) i.e.
approximated by a straight line.

the local trend for each segment is

3 Results

A part of typical time series for the heart activity of Drosophila melanogaster is presented
in panel (a) of Fig. 1. From these time series we can construct time series for the
interbeat intervals (presented in panel (b) of Fig. 1). Such time series are widely studied
for humans [18], [19] because they can be easily measured in a noninvasive way and
may have diagnostic and prognostic value. The interbeat time series of human heartbeat
dynamics has (i) monofractal properties (constant h) for humans with heart diseases and
(ii) multifractal properties (nonconstant h) for time series from healtly humans. As we
shall see this is not the case for Drosophila.

The autocorrelation functions for a healtly control ﬂy and for the parents with heart
defects are shown in Fig. 2. In all three panels we observe that a signiﬁcant degree of
correlation exists even for large values of n. In addition in panel (c) we observe systematic
decrease of the autocorrelation function and transition from predominantly correlated
behavior for small n to predominantly anticorrelated behavior for large n. Thus the
dynamical consequences of the diﬀerent genetic heart defects of Drosophila are clearly
visible.

Panel (a) of Fig. 3 shows the ﬂuctuation functions ( q = 2) for a healtly Drosophila
and for parent ﬂies with heart defects. In the case of humans the normal sinus rhythm of

The unit for time is 0.001 s. Panel (b): Interbeat intervals for the time series of heart
activity of Drosophila. As we can see the time series of the heart rate ﬂuctuate irregularly
from beat to beat.

the heartbeat activity has complex behavior similar to the behavior of a chaotic attractor
[1]. The heart dynamics of humans with heart diseases may become more periodic in
comparison to the heartbeat dynamics of the healtly individuals. The heartbeat dynamics
of the investigated here Drosophila shows opposite behavior. We see that the ﬂuctuation
function for the healtly Drosophila does not exhibit scaling at least for small s and this
lack of scaling is observed for all values of the parameter q. The deviation from the scaling
behavior for the ﬂuctuation function means that we can not calculate any fractal spectra
for the healtly Drosophila opposite to the case of the ﬂies with genetic defects where the
ﬂuctuation function can show good scaling properties for the whole studied range of s.
We note that the ﬂuctuation functions for the parents seem to be very close to a straight
line on a log-log scale. Thus we shall proceed with calculation of the fractal spectra.
These spectra will have diﬀerent properties for time series of Drosophila with diﬀerent
heart defects.

The Hurst exponent for the two parents is presented in Fig. 4. h is not a constant and
hence the two time series of the parents have multifractal properties. Thus multifractal
cardiac dynamics can be observed not only for humans but also for much simpler animals
like Drososphila. In ﬁgures 5 and 6 we see the kinds of spectra of the Hurst exponent char-
acteristic for the ﬁrst and second generations of ﬂies obtained from the above-mentioned
parents with genetically defect hearts. The spectra in panels (a) and (b) in Fig. 5 are
of the same kinds as the spectra of the two parents. The spectrum in panel (c) has non-
typical from the point of view of physics because in most physical systems h decreases

with increasing q. For the second generation of ﬂies we observe the two kinds of h(q)
spectra existing in the case of the parents plus an additional kind of spectrum with Hurst
exponent which is systematically smaller than 0.5 for positive q i.e. the anticorrelations
dominate the corresponding time series.

The diﬀerence in the dynamical properties of the intermaxima time series for the
heartbeat activity of Drosophila can be investigated by means of their f (α) spectra. Fig.
7 shows these spectra for the parents. For the spectra with parabolic form, the parts
of elements of the time series with a given value of α, build a partial fractal with a
fractal dimension denoted by f (α). The top part of the spectrum which is located around
some value f (α∗) corresponds to the statistical most signiﬁcant part of the spectrum
(corresponding to the parts of the time series with the largest dimension). f (α∗) gives
the value of this largest dimension and we can distinguish the time series with respect
to the value of α∗ and the width of the spectrum around the maximum ( ∆ = αr(f ∗) −
αl(f ∗), where f ∗ is characteristic which we shall take to be equal of 0.9fmax in order to
compare the parameters of the f (α) spectra of all generations of Drosophila. αl and αr
are the values of α corresponding to f ∗ and positioned to the left and to the right with
respect to the value α∗ corresponding to the maximum of the f (α) spectrum). Wide f (α)
spectrum corresponds to more distributed multifractal (the partial fractal dimensions are
less concentrated around the maximum partial dimension fmax) and a narrow spectrum
corresponds to more concentrated multifractal. Coming back to the spectra of parents in
Fig. 7 we observe the typical parabolic form of the spectrum only for the male parent.
Thus the form of the f (α) spectrum can help us to distinguish among the heart defects

the power law is shown as a continuous straight line. The closeness to a straight line on
the log-log scale means that the corresponding time series of the intermaxima intervals
have scaling properties. For comparison typical time series for a healtly Drosophila (ﬁlled
triangles) is presented. We do not observe scaling and thus we cannot calculate any fractal
spectra. Panel (b): Fluctuation functions F2(s) and power-law r.m.s. ﬁts (solid lines) for

of Drosophila as some of these defects (and in particular the genetic defect of the female
parent) can lead to nonparabolic form of the f (α) spectrum, i.e., to deviation from the
ideal multifractal behaviour. fmax = 1 for the spectrum of the male parent and its
0.9fmax width is ∆ = 0.18. The result of the combination of the two kinds of dynamics
leading to parabolic and nonparabolic f (α) spectra can be observed in the spectra of the
two generation of ﬂies following the parents. The characteristic spectra for the second
generation are presented in Fig. 8. We observe two kinds of consequences from the form
of the spectrum of the female parent (i) the nonparabolic kind of spectrum is reproduced
as it can be seen in panel (b) of Fig. 8. and (ii) some (but not al) of the parameters of
the parabolic spectra change. We note that for the parabolic spectra in panels (a), (c),
(d) of Fig. 8 fmax remains unchanged and equal to 1 not only for this generation of ﬂies
but also for the parabolic spectra in the next generation shown in Fig. 9. For the second
generation of ﬂies α for fmax is dispersed around 0.66 - its value for the male parent.

In the third generation of ﬂies the nonparabolic form of the spectrum is reproduced
again. From several characteristic examples of parabolic spectra of this generation which
are shown in Fig.9 only one of the spectra has a wide basis. For all spectra fmax = 1 and
for the spectra from panels (a), (c), (d) ∆ is almost the same.

that the presence of long-range correlations in the heartbeat activity is property not
only of humans and complex animals and can be observed in much simpler animals as
for example in Drosophila melanogaster. Opposite to the heartbeat dynamics of healtly
humans which is described by broad range of Hurst exponents the intermaxima intervals
of the time series of the heartbeat dynamics of healtly Drosophila do not have scaling
properties and thus it cannot be described by means of scaling exponents and fractal
spectra. We have shown that the presence of genetic defects can lead to long-range
correlations of the heartbeat dynamics of Drosophila. The transfer of the multifractal
properties from generation to generation and the similarity of the kinds and parameters
of the multifractal spectra for diﬀerent generations of Drosophila show that a correlation
could exists between genetic properties and dynamic patterns in the heartbeat activity of
simple animals like Drosophila. We can conjecture that the above correlation exists for
the case of other simple animals and probably also for the case of more complex animals
and ever humans.

Figure 7: The fractal spectrum f (α) for the time series of the parents. Panel (a): female
parent; Panel (b): male parent. Parameters of the spectrum in panel (b) are: αmin = 0.35,
αmax = 1.01, fmax = 1.00 at α = 0.66. αl(0.9fmax) = 0.57, αr(0.9fmax) = 0.75. Thus the
width ∆(0.9fmax) = 0.18.

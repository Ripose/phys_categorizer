Wavelets on the edge

The traditional continuous wavelet transform is plagued by the cone-of-inﬂuence, ie wavelets which
extend past either end of a ﬁnite timeseries return transform coeﬃcients which tend to decrease as
more of the wavelet is truncated. These coeﬃcients may be corrected simply by rescaling the
remaining wavelet. The corrected wavelet transform displays no cone-of-inﬂuence and maintains
reconstruction as either edge is approached. As an application and example, we present the corrected
wavelet transform of the (derectiﬁed) yearly International Sunspot Number, Ri, as a measure of solar
magnetic activity, and compare the yearly solar magnetic power with Oerlemans’ glacial global
temperature reconstruction.

INTRODUCTION

The continuous wavelet transform, or CWT, as tradi-

tionally deﬁned:

suﬀers from a decline in its response as the analyzing
wavelet runs oﬀ either edge of a ﬁnite timeseries of data.
This region, where the CWT coeﬃcients decrease,
is
known as the cone-of-inﬂuence. For the complex Mor-
let wavelet

, and Φ(t) = e−η

/2 is the scaling func-
where η =
tion, one may rescale wavelets on the edge by normaliz-
ing to unity the integral of the scaling function remain-
ing over the data (assuming unit normalization for the
untruncated scaling function). Let t be deﬁned on unit
intervals; t

and similarly for the right edge. Unlike adaptive wavelets
[1], this technique preserves the shape (if not the mo-
ments) of the analyzing wavelet regardless of the distance
to the edge.

ANALYSIS OF SOLAR MAGNETIC ACTIVITY

Edge corrected wavelet transform

To demonstrate the corrected wavelet transform, we
analyze the timeseries of sunspot data given by the In-
ternational Sunspot Number, Ri, at the SIDC [2]. Fol-
lowing Buck and Macaulay [3] and the observation by
Hale that the sunspot number should represent a rec-
tiﬁcation of the underlying solar magnetic activity, we
derectify the signal by taking the square root of Ri and
inserting alternating signs as appropriate

The familiar yearly sunspot numbers Ri are shown in
√Ri are dis-
Figure 1(a), and the derectiﬁed values
played in Figure 1(b). With derectiﬁcation, the sunspot
Schwabe cycle of
11 years is seen to correspond to the
magnetic Hale cycle of

22 years.
The uncorrected wavelet power spectral density is
shown in Figure 2(a).
It clearly displays the cone-of-
inﬂuence, as the amplitude of the dominant cycle cer-
tainly should not decrease as one approaches the present!
We see the eﬀects of the cone-of-inﬂuence on signal recon-
struction as a decline in the reconstructed amplitude as
the edge of the timeseries is approached in Figure 3. For
the corrected wavelet transform, Figure 2(b), no cone-of-
inﬂuence is seen, and perfectly adequate reconstruction
is maintained out to the edge, Figure 3.

Solar magnetic power vs global temperature

One may integrate the wavelet power spectral density
to ﬁnd the yearly solar magnetic power, Figure 4. Here
one sees a gentle oscillation in the two centuries follow-
ing the Maunder Minimum, followed by a clearly increas-
ing level of activity throughout the 20th century. Plot-
ted alongside is Oerlemans’ glacial reconstruction of the

global temperature “anomaly” [4], deﬁned as the diﬀer-
ence from the mean temperature of some years around
1950. Again, gentle oscillations are followed by a clear
warming trend in the 20th century. As the solar dynamo
is powered by convective (and other?) ﬂows within the
sun [5], an increase in solar magnetic activity might well
correlate with an increase in solar irradiance, with cli-
matic consequences here on Earth.

CONCLUSIONS

By rescaling the wavelets on the edges of a timeseries
of data, one may construct a corrected wavelet transform
which has no cone-of-inﬂuence and maintains reconstruc-
tion. Applying the corrected wavelet transform to the
solar magnetic activity as recorded in sunspot data, a
clearly increasing level of activity is seen during the 20th
century. A correlation with global temperature is ob-
served. We note that the corrected wavelet transform
may be further enhanced [6] to reveal more detailed in-

formation about the yearly harmonic content of the solar
magnetic activity record.

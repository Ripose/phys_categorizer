The high frequency ﬁnancial data of the foreign exchange market (EUR/CHF, EUR/GBP,
EUR/JPY, EUR/NOK, EUR/SEK, EUR/USD, NZD/USD, USD/CAD, USD/CHF, USD/JPY,
USD/NOK, and USD/SEK) are analyzed by utilizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two
normalized spectrograms of the tick frequency. We detect and characterize temporal structure
variations of the similarity between currency pairs. A simple agent-based model that N market
participants exchange M currency pairs is proposed. The equation for the tick frequency is approx-
imately derived in the theoretical manner. From the analysis of this model the spectral distance
of the tick frequency is associated with the similarity of behavior (perception and decision) of the
market participants to exchange these currency pairs.

I. INTRODUCTION

The recent accumulation of high frequency ﬁnancial data due to development and spread of information technology
has sparked considerable interest in ﬁnancial markets among researchers [1–10]. Many researchers expect that they
bring new ﬁndings and insights to both ﬁnance and physics. The ﬁnancial markets are complex systems. Since we
need an enormous amount of data in order to describe and understand them at a microscopic level, we have to employ
methodology for complex systems [11] in order to treat data of the ﬁnancial markets. We have to ﬁnd adequate
variables or relevant quantities to describe the properties of them. A macroscopic description allows us to compress
the information with global properties. As a result an important step in treating ﬁnancial markets is to establish
relations between various macroscopic quantities.

On the other hand agent-based models as complex systems are attracting signiﬁcant interest across a broad range
of disciplines. Many agent-based models to explain the behavior of ﬁnancial markets are proposed during the last
decade [12–17]. The agent-based models are expected to be an alternative to phenomenological models that duplicate
mimic market price ﬂuctuations. Speciﬁcally it seems to be worth to consider the explanation capability of the
agent-based models for causality.

In the previous article the author reported that the tick frequency, which is deﬁned as the number of ticks per
unit time, exhibits periodic motions due to collective motion of the market participants [18,19]. As results of spectral
analysis on the foreign exchange market they appear and disappear depending on both observation periods and
currency pairs. Moreover in order to explain the periodic behavior of the tick frequency a simple agent-based model
based on the double-threshold noisy devices [20,21] is proposed. The result of quantifying the similarity of tick
frequency of two currency pairs based on the spectral distance deﬁned by the Kullback-Leibler divergence of two
spectrograms detected structure of the foreign exchange market [22].

In this article we discuss the meaning of the spectral distance of the tick frequency in theoretical manner. The
agent-based model which consists of N market participants who choose their action among three kinds of investment
attitudes is order to exchange M currency pairs. In this model the heterogeneous agents perceive information in
environment, which are separated into exogenous factor (news about events) and endogenous factor (news about
market ﬂuctuations), and decide their action based on them. They have two thresholds to select their action among
three kinds of investment attitudes (buying, selling, and waiting). Analysis of this model concludes that the spectral
distance of the tick frequency is equivalent to behavioral similarity of market participants who exchange the currency
pairs.

This article is organized as follows. In Sec. II the high-frequency ﬁnancial data of 12 currency pairs in the foreign
exchange market are analyzed based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two normalized spectrograms. In
Sec. III an agent-based model that N market participants deal with M currency pairs is proposed. In Sec. IV from
the agent-based model the equation for the tick frequency is approximately derived and the relation between the
spectral distance of the tick frequency and the behavior of market participants is discussed. Sec. V is devoted into
concluding remarks.

II. FREQUENCY ANALYSIS

A. Data

We investigate the foreign currency market data of United States Dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), Switzerland Francs
(CHF), Great Britain Pounds (GBP), Norway Krone (NOK), Sweden Kronor (SEK), Canada Dollars (CAD), New
Zealand Dollars (NZD), and Japan Yen (JPY), which are provided from CQG Inc [23]. The data include two quote
rates, namely, bid and ask, in the resolution of minutes. The bid and ask are the rates at which bank traders are
willing to buy and sell a unit of currency. All traders in the foreign exchange market have a rule to quotes both rates
at the same time. Generally the ask is higher than the bid and the diﬀerence between bid and ask is called bid-ask
spread.

The datum investigated in this article are two kinds of database. One includes 12 currency pairs, EUR/CHF,
EUR/GBP, EUR/JPY, EUR/NOK, EUR/SEK, EUR/USD, NZD/USD, USD/CAD, USD/CHF, USD/JPY,
USD/NOK, and USD/SEK during period from 1st to 29th September 2000. The other includes 3 currency pairs,
EUR/USD, EUR/JPY, and USD/JPY during period from 4th January 1999 to 31st December 2004. The data start
on 17:00 (CST) of Sunday, and ﬁnish on 16:59 (CST) of Friday. The foreign exchange market is open for 24 hours on
weekdays. On Saturdays and Sundays, we ﬁnd no tick on the data set because almost all banks are close.

The tick frequency is deﬁned by counting how many times bank traders quote the bid and ask rates per unit time.
According to this deﬁnition the currency pair having high quote frequency means active. Since bank traders usually
quote both bid and ask rates at the same time, it is suﬃcient to count only bid or only ask. Therefore the tick
frequency is deﬁned as the number of ask quotes per unit time,

A(k) =

C(k∆t; (k + 1)∆t),

∆t

where C(t1; t2) means the number of the ask quotes from t1 to t2, and ∆t denotes a sampling period, and ∆t = 1
minutes throughout this analysis.

The spectrogram is estimated with a discrete Fourier transform for time series multiplied by the Hanning window.
(k = 0, 1, 2, . . .) time series of tick frequencies. The spectrogram with the Hanning window represented as

where T denotes representative time to localize the data by the window function whose range is L∆t. Since the
Nyquist critical frequency is given by fc = 1/(2∆t) = 0.5 [1/min] we can detect behavior of the market participants
in 2 [min] resolution.

For a purpose to quantify the similarity between the currency pairs, we employ a method of the Kullback-Leibler
divergence (KL) between normalized spectrograms of the tick frequency [18]. The KL is deﬁned as a functional of two
normalized positive functions [24]. In order to apply the KL method to the spectrogram we introduce the normalized
spectrogram as follows,

The KL between the spectrograms without direct current component for the i-th currency pair, pi(n, T ), and that for
the j-th currency pair, pj(n, T ), is deﬁned as

From the deﬁnition of the KL it is always non-negative,

with KLij(T ) = 0 if and only if pi(n, T ) = pj(n, T ). Note that Kij(T ) is asymmetric dissimilarity matrix which is
satisﬁed with

Kij(T )

Generally asymmetric matrix is separated into symmetric matrix and asymmetric matrix,

Kij(T )

= Kji(T ), Kii(T ) = 0.

Kij(T ) = Jij(T ) + Iij (T ),

where Jij(T ) = (Kij(T ) + Kji(T ))/2, Iij (T ) = (Kij (T )

C. Results

Fig. 1 shows the symmetrical Kullback-Leibler distance among 12 currency pairs Aij (T ) on the Asian timezone
(T =0:00 (GMT)), the European timezone (T =8:00 (GMT)), and the American timezone (T =16:00 (GMT)) at 4th
Septmber 2000.

The patterns of similarity and dissimilarity are captured at each timezone. There exist similar currency pairs and
dissimilar currency pairs. The similarity and dissimilarity between currency pairs temporally varies. Furthermore the
variations of similarity and dissimilarity are slow. Namely some similarities and dissimilarities are updated at each
time step and others are almost constant.

the European timezone (T =8:00 (GMT)) (center), and the American timezone (T =16:00 (GMT)) (right) at 4th September
2000 for N = 480 (8 hours). The thin/thick lines between the i-th currency pair and the j-th currency pair represent
similarity/dissimilarity between them, Kij (T ).

The results of the KL values among the EUR/USD, the USD/JPY, and the EUR/JPY during period from 4th
January 1999 to 31 December 2004 are shown in Fig. 2. The KL between the EUR/USD and the EUR/JPY are
relatively decreasing as time passed. For the period from the middle of 1999 to the middle of 2000 high values last.
They decrease from the beginning of 2000 and they tend to be less than 0.1 from the beginning of 2001. The KL
between the USD/JPY and EUR/USD tend to be greater than 0.1. They do not change drastically. The KL between
the USD/JPY and EUR/JPY are relatively decreasing as time passed. They are high for the period from the middle
of 1999 to the middle 2000. From the beginning of 2000 they decrease and for the period from the middle of 2000 to
the ﬁrst quarter of 2001 they are high. For the period from the ﬁrst quarter of 2001 to third quarter of 2001 they are
high. From the beginning of 2004 they became low. They become high at new year days.

The KL values have a tendency to decrease year by year. Hence, the recent markets are more similar than the past
markets. The reason why the recent markets are similar seems to be because market participants all over the world
behave similarly due to development of information technology and communication technology.

III. AGENT-BASED MODEL

Consider N market participants who deal with M currency pairs. The ith market participant perceives information
from environment xi(t). On the basis of this information he/she determines his/her investment attitude. Let yij (t)
denote investment attitude of the i-th market participant for the j-th currency pair. The market participants are able
to select his/her action from three investment attitudes (buying, selling, and waiting).

According to the Virginia Satir’s seven step model from perception to action, which is one of psychological models
of human [25], we consider an agent-based model of the foreign exchange market. In the Virginia Satir’s model a
process from perception to action is separated into seven main steps; perception of information, interpretation, feeling,
feeling about the feeling, defense, rule for acting, and action.

For simplicity the i-th market participant perceives information xi(t), which is evaluated as a scalar value. This
information builds a momentum that the market participant decides his/her investment attitude. The market partici-
pant interprets the information and determines his/her attitude on the basis of the interpretation. Since the possibility
of interpretation is greatly high and dependent on time and market participants the diﬀerence of action depending
on the interpretation is modeled by a noise ξi(t), which is unique for the i-th agent at time t. It is assumed that a
result of the interpretation xi(t) + ξi(t) drives feeling to determine his/her investment attitude. Furthermore feeling
about the feeling checks the validity of the feeling and drives his/her actions. In order to model the feeling about
the feeling we introduce a multiplicative factor aij(t) which represents the feeling about the feeling of the i-th market
participant for the j-th currency pair. If aij (t) is positive then the feeling about the feeling supports the feeling. If
aij(t) is negative then the feeling about the feeling denies the feeling. The absolute value of aij(t) represents intensity
of the feeling about the feeling. Since the determination depends on both the feeling and the feeling about the feeling
the investment attitude is assumed to be determined from the value aij (t)(xi(t) + ξi(t)). If it is large then the market
participant tends to make a buying decision. Contrary if it is small then he/she tends to make a selling decision. For
simplicity it is assumed that a trading volume can be ignored.

The action is determined on the basis of his/her feeling about the feeling. Since the decision and action have
strong nonlinearity the action is determined with Granovetter type threshold dynamics [26]. In order to separate
three actions two threshold are needed at least. Deﬁning the threshold for the i-th market participant to determine
buying the j-th currency pair as θB
ij(t)), three investment attitudes (buying: 1,
selling: -1, and waiting: 0) are determined by

ij (t) and selling it as θS

ij (t) > θS

Furthermore it is assumed that the information is described as the endogenous factor, moving average of log return

IV. DISCUSSION

Since the market participants have limitation due to ﬁnite time and capacity to perceive the information and deter-
mine the investment attitude, it is reasonable to assume Tij(t) is ﬁnite and constant, i.e., Tij(t) = Tij. Furthermore
for simplicity it is assumed that ξi(t) is sampled from the independent Gaussian distribution,

pξ(ξi) =

where σ(> 0) represents the standard deviation of uncertainty of the interpretation. Then yij(t) are random variables

ij represent the i-th agent’s decision and perception for the
j-th currency pairs and aij feeling about the feeling of the i-th agent for the j-th currency pairs Klm is associated
with behavioral similarity of the market participants who exchange the lth-currency pair and the mth-currency pair.
Namely the similarity of the tick frequency between the lth-currency pair and mth-currency pair is equivalent to the
similarity of behavior (perception and decision) whose the market participants exchange the lth-currency pair and
the mth-currency pair.

Moreover the symmetrical Kullback-Leibler distance

can be described by using the normalized autocorrelation functions and the cepstral coeﬃcients [28]. Let rl(t) denote

Jlm is also associated with similarity between the normalized autocorrelation functions and between the cepstral
coeﬃcients. Therefore these quantities can characterize the behavioral structure of the participants in the market.

As shown in Sec. II the Kullback-Leibler divergence among currency pairs temporally varies and there exist similar
pairs and dissimilar pairs. These temporal structure variations of the Kullback-Leibler divergence seem to capture and
characterize behavior of the market participants. The perception and decision of the market participants who deal
with these currency pairs temporally vary but there exist some kinds of patterns of perception and decision during
short time. The collective behavior of the market participants can be capture by analyzing the tick frequency.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We investigated the tick frequency of the foreign exchange market for 12 currency pairs (EUR/CHF, EUR/GBP,
EUR/JPY, EUR/NOK, EUR/SEK, EUR/USD, NZD/USD, USD/CAD, USD/CHF, USD/JPY, USD/NOK, and
USD/SEK). As the result to characterize the similarity between two currency pairs by utilizing the spectral distance
based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two normalized spectrograms it is found that behavioral structure
of market participants in the foreign exchange market dynamically varies and that the present markets are more
In order to understand meaning of the similarity between two currency pairs the

agent-based model that N market participants exchange M currency pairs is considered. It can be concluded that
the spectral distance for the tick frequency characterizes the behavioral similarity of the market participants who deal
with those currency pairs.

Analyzing the tick frequency as well as prices or rates will provide us deep insights about ﬁnancial markets from

both ﬁnance and physics point of view.

Abstract

We perform statistical analysis of the single-vehicle data measured on the Dutch freeway A9 and discussed in [2].
Using tools originating from the Random Matrix Theory we show that the signiﬁcant changes in the statistics of the trafﬁc
data can be explained applying equilibrium statistical physics of interacting particles.

The detailed understanding of the processes acting in
the trafﬁc systems is one of the most essential parts of the
trafﬁc research. The basic knowledge on the vehicular in-
teractions can be found by means of the statistical analy-
sis of the single-vehicle data. As reported in Ref. [3] the
microscopical trafﬁc structure can be described with the
help of a repulsive potential describing the mutual inter-
action between successive cars in the chain of vehicles. Es-
pecially, the probability density P (r) for the distance r of
the two subsequent cars (clearance distribution) can be de-
scribed with the help of an one dimensional gas having an
inverse temperature β and interacting by a repulsive poten-
tial V (r) = r−1 - see Ref. [4] and [3]. Such a potential
leads to a clearance distribution

Another way to seek for the interaction between cars
within the highway data is to investigate the trafﬁc ﬂow

A statistical analysis of the data set recorded on the

Plus signs and stars represent the variance of average time-gaps for free
and congested ﬂows, respectively.

There is, however, one substantial drawback of this de-
scription. The time-gap variance was introduced ad hoc
and hardly anything is known about its exact mathematical
properties in the case of interacting vehicles. It is therefore
appropriate to look for an alternative that is mathemati-
cally well understood. A natural candidate is the number
variance ∆n that was introduced originally for describing
the statistics of eigenvalues in the Random Matrix Theory.
It reproduces also the variances in the particle positions
of certain class of one dimensional interacting gases (for
example Dyson gas in Ref. [1]).

Dividing the interval [0, Q] into subintervals [(k

and represents the statistical variance of the number of
vehicles moving at the same time inside a ﬁxed part of
the road of a length L. The mathematical properties of
the number variance are well understood. For independent
events one gets ∆n(L) = L. Applying it to the highway
data in the low density regime (free trafﬁc) one obtains
however ∆n(L)
5L/6 (not plotted). The small deviation
from the behavior ∆n(L) = L, is induced by the weak (but
still nonzero) interaction among the cars.

≈

The situation becomes more tricky when a congested
trafﬁc is investigated. The touchy point is that behavior
of the number variance is sensitive to the temperature of
the underlying gas - or in the terminology of the Random
Matrix Theory - to the universality class of the random ma-
trix ensemble. To use the known mathematical results one
has not to mix together states with different densities - a
procedure known as data unfolding in the Random Matrix
Theory. For the transportation this means than one cannot
mix together trafﬁc states with different trafﬁc densities
and hence with different vigilance of the drivers. So we
will perform a separate analysis of the data-samples lying
within short density intervals to prevent so the undesirable
mixing of the different states.

We divide the region of the measured densities ̺
∈
[0, 85 veh/km/lane] into eighty ﬁve equidistant subinter-
vals and analyze the data from each one of them separately.
The number variance ∆n(L) evaluated with the data in
a ﬁxed density interval has a characteristic linear tail (see
Fig. 2) that is well known from the Random Matrix Theory.
It was found in models of one-dimensional thermodynam-
ical gases with the nearest-neighbor repulsion among the
particles (see Ref. [5]). We remind that for the case where
the interaction is not restricted to the nearest neighbors
but includes all particles the number variance has typically
a logarithmical tail - see [1]. So the linear tail of ∆n(L)
supports the view that in the trafﬁc the interactions are re-
stricted to the few nearest cars only. The slope of the linear
tail of ∆n(L) decreases with the trafﬁc density (see the top
subplot in the Fig. 3). It is a consequence of the increas-
ing alertness of the drivers and hence of the increasing
coupling between the neighboring cars in the dense trafﬁc
ﬂows.

The fact that the behavior of the number variance evalu-
ated from the trafﬁc data coincides with the results obtained
for interacting one-dimensional gases strengthen the idea
to apply the equilibrium statistical physics for the descrip-
tion the local properties of the trafﬁc ﬂow. We take the
advantage of this approach in a following thermodynami-
cal trafﬁc model.

temperature β. Let xi (i = 1 . . . N ) denote the position of
the i-th particle and put xN +1 = x1 + N, for convenience.

with the respect to the realistic behavior of a car-driver in
the trafﬁc stream. As published in Ref. [4], the heat bath
drives the model into the thermal equilibrium and the prob-
ability density P (r) for gap r among the neighboring par-
ticles corresponds to the function (1).

According to [1], the number variance ∆n(L) of an one

termined from its spacing distribution P (r). For the clear-

dent events. The slope χ is a decreasing function of β.

Fig. 3. The slope χ and the inverse temperature β as a function of the
trafﬁc density ̺.

The squares on the upper subplot display the slope of the number
variance ∆n(L) (see Fig. 2), separately analyzed for various densities.
The lower subplot visualizes the ﬁtted values of the inverse temperature
β, for which the exact form of number variance
∆n(L) = χ(β) L + γ(β) corresponds to the number variance obtained
from the trafﬁc data. The continuous curves represent a polynomial
approximations of the relevant data.

The described properties of the function ∆n(L) agree
with the behavior of the number variance extracted from
the trafﬁc data (see Fig. 2). A comparison between trafﬁc
data number variance and the formula (3) allows us to de-
termine the empirical dependence of inverse temperature
β on trafﬁc density ̺. The inverse temperature reﬂects the
microscopic status in which the individual vehicular inter-
actions inﬂuence the trafﬁc. Conversely, in the macroscopic
approach, trafﬁc is treated as a continuum and modelled by
aggregated, ﬂuid-like quantities, such as density and ﬂow
(see [6]). Its most prominent result is the dependence of the
trafﬁc ﬂow on the trafﬁc density - the fundamental diagram.

It is clear that the macroscopic trafﬁc characteristics are
determined by its microscopic status. Consequently there
should be a relation between the behavior of the fundamen-
tal diagram and that of the inverse temperature β. On the
Figure 4 we display the behavior of the inverse tempera-
ture β simultaneously with the fundamental diagram. The
both curves show a virtually linear increase in the region
10 veh/km/lane). The inverse
of a free trafﬁc (up to ̺

≈

≈

temperature β then display a plateau for the densities up
to 18 veh/km/lane while the ﬂow continues to increase.
A detailed inspection uncovers, however, that the increase
of the trafﬁc ﬂow ceases to be linear and becomes con-
cave at that region. So the ﬂow is reduced with respect to
the outcome expected for a linear behavior - a manifes-
tation of the onset of the phenomenon that ﬁnally leads
to a congested trafﬁc. For larger densities the temperature
β increases up to ̺ ' 32 veh/km/lane. The center of
25 - a critical point of the
this interval is localized at ̺
fundamental diagram at which the ﬂow starts to decrease.
This behavior of the inverse temperature is understandable
and imposed by the fact that the drivers, moving quite fast
in a relatively dense trafﬁc ﬂow, have to synchronize their
driving with the preceding car (a strong interaction) and are
therefore under a considerable psychological pressure. Af-
ter the transition from the free to a congested trafﬁc regime
(between 40 and 50 veh/km/lane), the synchronization
continues to decline because of the decrease in the mean
velocity leading to decreasing β. Finally - for densities
related to the congested trafﬁc - the inverse temperature
increases while the ﬂow remains constant. The comparison
between the trafﬁc ﬂow and the inverse temperature is even
more illustrative when the changes of the ﬂow are taken
into account. Therefore we evaluate the derivative of the
ﬂow and plot the result on the Figure 5. The behavior of
the inverse temperature β can be understood as a quantita-
tive description of the alertness required by the drivers in a
given situation.

β obtained from the number variance ∆n(L). It is known
(see [1]) that for one dimensional gases in thermal equi-
librium the function ∆n(L) can be determined from the
knowledge of the spacing distribution P (r). So the fact
that obtaining β by virtue of the number variance ∆n(L)
and the spacing distribution P (r) leads to the same results
supports the view that locally the trafﬁc can be described
by instruments of equilibrium statistical physics.

In summary, we have investigated the statistical vari-
ances of the single-vehicle data from the Dutch freeway
A9. Particularly we have separately analyzed the number
variance in eighty ﬁve equidistant density-subregions and
found a linear dependence in each of them. Using the ther-
modynamical model presented originally in Ref.[3], we
have found an excellent agreement between the number
variance of particles in thermal-equilibrium and that of the
trafﬁc data. It was demonstrated that the inverse tempera-
ture of the trafﬁc sample, indicating the degree of alertness
of the drivers, shows an increase at both the low and high
densities. In the intermediate region, where the free ﬂow
regime converts to the congested trafﬁc, it displays more
complex behavior.

The presented results support the possibility for apply-
ing the equilibrium statistical physics to the trafﬁc systems.
It conﬁrms also the hypothesis that short-ranged forwardly-
directed power-law potential (2) is a good choice for de-
scribing the fundamental interaction among the vehicles.

The dependence of β on the density ̺ can be obtained
also using the measured clearance distribution and compar-

We would like to thank Dutch Ministry of Transport for
providing the single-vehicle induction-loop-detector data.

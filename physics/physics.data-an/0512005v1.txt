Abstract

We introduce a model of proportional growth to explain the distribution Pg(g) of business ﬁrm

growth rates. The model predicts that Pg(g) is exponential in the central part and depicts an

asymptotic power-law behavior in the tails with an exponent ζ = 3. Because of data limitations,

previous studies in this ﬁeld have been focusing exclusively on the Laplace shape of the body of

the distribution. In this article, we test the model at diﬀerent levels of aggregation in the economy,

from products to ﬁrms to countries, and we ﬁnd that the model’s predictions agree with empirical

growth distributions and size-variance relationships.

INTRODUCTION

Gibrat [1, 2], building upon the work of the astronomers Kapteyn [3], assumed the ex-

pected value of the growth rate of a business ﬁrm’s size to be proportional to the current

size of the ﬁrm, which is called “Law of Proportionate Eﬀect” [4, 5]. Several models of

proportional growth have been subsequently introduced in economics in order to explain the

growth of business ﬁrms [6, 7, 8]. Simon and co-authors [9, 10, 11, 12] extended Gibrat’s

model by introducing an entry process according to which the number of ﬁrms rise over time.

In Simon’s framework, the market consists of a sequence of many independent “opportuni-

ties” which arise over time, each of size unity. Models in this tradition have been challenged

by many researchers [13, 14, 15, 16, 17] who found that the ﬁrm growth distribution is not

Gaussian but displays a tent shape.

Here we introduce a general framework that provides an unifying explanation for the

growth of business ﬁrms based on the number and size distribution of their elementary

constituent components [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. Speciﬁcally we present a model of

proportional growth in both the number of units and their size and we draw some general

implications on the mechanisms which sustain business ﬁrm growth [7, 11, 21, 26, 27, 28].

According to the model, the probability density function (PDF) of growth rates is Laplace
in the center [13] with power law tails [29, 30] decaying as Pg(g) ∼ g−ζ where ζ = 3.

Because of data limitations, previous studies in this ﬁeld focus on the Laplace shape of

the body of the distribution [31]. Using a database on the size and growth of ﬁrms and

products, we characterize the shape of the whole growth rate distribution.

We test our model by analyzing diﬀerent levels of aggregation of economic systems,

from the “micro” level of products to the “macro” level of industrial sectors and national

economies. We ﬁnd that the model accurately predicts the shape of the PDF of growth rate

at all levels of aggregation studied.

II. THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

We model business ﬁrms as classes consisting of a random number of units. Accord-

ing to this view, a ﬁrm is represented as the aggregation of its constituent units such

as divisions [22], businesses [20], or products [21]. Accordingly, on a diﬀerent level of

2

coarse-graining, a class can represent a national economy composed by economic units such

as ﬁrms.

In this article we study the logarithm of the one-year growth rate of classes

g

log(S(t + 1)/S(t)) where S(t) and S(t + 1) are the sizes of classes in the year t and t + 1

≡

measured in monetary values (GDP for countries, sales for ﬁrms and products). Our model

is illustrated in Fig. 1. Two key sets of assumptions in the model are (A) the number of

units in a class grows in proportion to the existing number of units and (B) the size of each

unit ﬂuctuates in proportion to its size.

The ﬁrst set of assumptions is:

(A1) Each class α consists of Kα(t) number of units. At time t = 0, time step measured

by year generally, there are N(0) classes consisting of n(0) total number of units. The

initial average number of units in a class is thus n(0)/N(0).

(A2) At each time step a new unit is created. Thus the number of units at time t is

n(t) = n(0) + t.

(A3) With birth probability b, this new unit is assigned to a new class, so that the average

number of classes at time t is N(t) = N(0) + bt.

(A4) With probability 1

b, a new unit is assigned to an existing class α with probability

−

Pα = (1

b)Kα(t)/n(t), so Kα(t + 1) = Kα(t) + 1.

−

For simplicity, we do not consider the decrease of the number of units in a class.

In

reality, elementary units enter and exit. Because we are considering the case of a growing

economy, it is legitimate to assume the entry rate being higher than the exit rate. On the

average, the net entry rate of units can be simpliﬁed as a positive constant. In the model,

the net entry rate of units is ﬁxed at 1. Thus, at large t, it gives results equivalent to the

ones that would have been obtained considering a value for the exit rate of units.

Our goal is to ﬁnd P (K), the probability distribution of the number of units in the classes

at large t. This model in two limiting cases (i) b = 0, Kα = 1 (α = 1, 2 . . . N(0)) and (ii)

b

= 0, N(0) = 1, n(0) = 1 has exact analytical solutions P (K) = N(0)/t(t/(t + N(0)))K(1 +

O(1/t)) [32, 33] and lim
t→∞

P (K) = (1 + b)Γ(K)Γ(2 + b)/Γ(K + 2 + b) [34] respectively.

In the general case, the exact analytical solution is not known and we obtain a numerical

solution by computer simulations and compare it with the approximate mean ﬁeld solution.

(see, e.g., Chapter 6 of [35] and Appendix A)

Our results are consistent with the exactly solvable limiting cases as well as with the

empirical data on the number of products in the pharmaceutical ﬁrms and can summarized

as follows. In the limit of large t, the distribution of K in the old classes that existed at

t = 0 converges to an exponential distribution [36]

III. THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE

To test our model, we analyze diﬀerent levels of aggregation of economic systems, from

the micro level of products to the macro level of industrial sectors and national economies.

First, we analyze a new and unique database, the pharmaceutical industry database

(PHID), which records sales ﬁgures of the 189,303 products commercialized by 7,184 phar-

maceutical ﬁrms in 21 countries from 1994 to 2004, covering the whole size distribution for

products and ﬁrms and monitoring the ﬂows of entry and exit at both levels kindly pro-

vided by the EPRIS program. Then, we study the growth rates of all U.S. publicly-traded

ﬁrms from 1973 to 2004 in all industries, based on Security Exchange Commission ﬁlings

(Compustat). Finally, at the macro level, we study the growth rates of the gross domestic

product (GDP) of 195 countries from 1960 to 2004 (World Bank).

Fig. 3 shows that the growth distributions of countries, ﬁrms, and products are well ﬁtted

by the distribution in Eq. (12) with diﬀerent values of Vg. Indeed, growth distributions at

any level of aggregation depict marked departures from a Gaussian shape. Moreover, even

if the Pg(g) of GDP can be approximated by a Laplace distribution, the Pg(g) of ﬁrms

and products are clearly more leptokurtic than Laplace. Based on our model, the growth

distribution is Laplace in the body, with power-law tails. In fact, Fig. 4 show that the central

body part of the growth rate distributions at any level of aggregation is well approximated

by a double exponential ﬁt. Fig. 5 reveals that the asymptotic behaviors of g at any level

of aggregation can be well ﬁtted by power-law with an exponent ζ = 3.

Our analysis in Sec. II predicts that the power law regime of Pg(g) may vary depending

on the behavior of P (K) for K

1, and the distribution of the growth rates of units. In

case of PHID, for which P (1)

P (3) . . . the growth rate distribution of ﬁrms must

→
P (2)

≫

≫

be almost the same as the growth rate distribution of products, as we stated in Sec. II. Hence

the power law wings of Pg(g) for ﬁrms originate on the level of products. Because PHID

does not contain information on the subunits of products we can not test our prediction

directly, but we can hypothesize that the distribution of the product subunits (number

7

of customers or shipping ways) is less dominated by small K, but has a suﬃciently wide

power law regime due to the inﬂux of new products. These rather plausible assumptions are

suﬃcient to explain the shape of the distribution of the product growth rates, which is well

described by Eq. (12).

The PHID database allows us to test the empirical conditional distribution Pg(g

K) and

the dependence of its variance σ2 on K, where K is the number of products. We ﬁnd that

|

K −0.28, which is signiﬁcantly smaller than 1/√K behavior. This result does not imply

σ

∼

correlations among product growth rates on the ﬁrm level [21], but can be explained by

the fact that for skewed distributions of product sizes Pξ(ξ) characterized by large Vξ, the

convergence of Pg(g

K) to its Gaussian limit Eq. (8) is slow and the growth rates of the

|

ﬁrms are determined by the growth of the few large products. Using the empirical values

for the PHID µξ = 3.44, Vξ = 5.13, µη = 0.016, Vη = 0.36 and assuming lognormality of the

distributions Pξ(ξ) and Pη(η) we ﬁnd that the behavior of σ can be well approximated by a

power law σ

K −0.20 for K < 103. For this set of parameters, the convergence of Pg(g

K)

to a Gaussian distribution takes place only for K > 105. This result is consistent with

∼

|

the observations of the power law relationship between ﬁrm size and growth rate variance

reported earlier [13, 18, 19, 38].

IV. DISCUSSION

Business ﬁrms grow by increasing their scale and scope. The scope of a ﬁrm is given

by the number of its products. The scale of a ﬁrm is given by the size of its products. A

ﬁrm like Microsoft gets few big products while Amazon sells a huge variety of goods, each

of small size in terms of sales. In this article we argue that both mechanisms of growth are

proportional. The number of products a ﬁrm can successfully launch is proportional to the

number of products it has already commercialized. Once a product has been launched its

success depends on the number of customers who buy it and the price they are willing to pay.

To a large extent, if products are diﬀerent enough, the success of a product is independent

from other products commercialized by the same company. Hence, the sales of products

can be modeled as independent stochastic processes. Moreover, sometimes, new products

are commercialized by new companies. As a result, small companies with few products can

experience sudden jerks of growth due to the successful launch of a new product.

8

In this article, we ﬁnd that the empirical distribution of ﬁrm growth rates exhibits a

central part which is distributed according to a Laplace distribution and power-law wings
Pg(g) ∼ g−ζ where ζ = 3. If the distribution of number of units K is dominated by single

unit classes, the tails of ﬁrm growth rate are primarily due to smaller ﬁrms composed of one

or few products. The Laplace center of the distribution is shaped by big multiproduct ﬁrms.

We ﬁnd that the shape of the distribution of ﬁrm growth is almost the same in presence of a

small entry rate and with zero entry. We also ﬁnd that the model’s predictions are accurate

also in the case of product growth rates, which implies that products can be considered

as composed by elementary sale units, which evolve according to a random multiplicative

process [6]. Although there are several plausible explanations for the Laplace body of the

distribution [18, 31], the power law decay of the tails has not previously been observed.

We introduce a simple and general model that accounts for both the central part and the

tails of the distribution. The shape of the business growth rate distribution is due to the

proportional growth of both the number and the size of the constituent units in the class.

This result holds in the case of an open economy (with entry of new ﬁrms) as well as in the

case of a closed economy (with no entry of new ﬁrms).

Appendix A: The distribution of units in old and new classes

Assume that at the beginning there are N(0) classes with n(0) units. Because at every

time step one unit is added to the system and a new class is added with probability b,

at moment t there are n(t) = n(0) + t units and N(t) = N(0) + bt classes, among which

there are bt new classes with nnew units and N(0) old classes with nold units, such that

nold + nnew = n(0) + t.

Because of the preferential attachment assumption, we have

Solving the second diﬀerential equation and taking into account initial condition nold(0) =

n(0), we obtain

K(t) =

Analogously, the number of units at time t in the classes existing at time t0 is

where the subscript ‘e’ means “existing”. The average number of units in old classes is

It is known that [36] for t

the preferential attachment model converges to the

·

The average number of units in these classes is K(t0, t) = nnew(t0, t)/b dt = (n(0) +

The distribution of the growth rate of the old classes can be found by Eq. (7) in the

text.

In order to ﬁnd a close form approximation, we replace the summation in Eq. (7)

by integration and replace the distributions P (K) by Eq. (A6) and P (g) by the Eq. (A26)

Earthquake occurrence in nature is thought to result from correlated elastic stresses, leading to
clustering in space and time. We show that occurrence of major earthquakes in California correlates
with time intervals when ﬂuctuations in small earthquakes are suppressed relative to the long term
average. We estimate a probability of less than 1% that this coincidence is due to random clustering.

INTRODUCTION

It is widely accepted [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
that the observed earthquake scaling laws indicate the
existence of phenomena closely associated with prox-
imity of the system to a critical point. More speciﬁ-
cally, it has been proposed that earthquake dynamics
are associated either with a second order critical point
[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11] or a mean ﬁeld spinodal [9, 10] that can
be understood as a line of critical points. Mean ﬁeld the-
ories of the Ginzburg-Landau type have been proposed
[7, 8, 9, 10] to explain the phenomenology associated with
scaling and nucleation processes of earthquakes, which
would in turn imply that a Ginzburg criterion is appli-
cable [12]. If mean ﬁeld Ginzburg-Landau equations do
describe earthquakes, the dynamics must be operating
outside the critical region, and ﬂuctuations are corre-
spondingly reduced.

To summarize our results

We compare the performance of two probability mea-
sures that deﬁne the locations of future earthquake occur-
rence: the spatially coarse-grained seismic intensity and
the intensity change. We show that an order parameter
ΨI (t) can be deﬁned based on the performance of these
probability measures on a Receiver Operating Character-
istic (ROC) diagram and that a generalized Ginzburg
criterion G(t) can be established measuring the relative
importance of ﬂuctuations in ΨI (t). We ﬁnd that since
1960, major earthquakes in California with magnitudes
m ≥ 6 tend to preferentially occur during intervals of
time when G(t) < 1, consistent with mean ﬁeld dynam-
ics. Currently in northern California, G(t) < 1.

tudes −124◦E and −115◦E, coarse-grained in time inter-
vals of one day. Only events above a magnitude threshold
mT ≥ 3 are used to ensure catalog completeness. Fig-
ure 1 shows the event locations. We tile the region with a
spatially coarse-grained mesh of N boxes, or pixels, hav-
ing side length 0.1◦, about 11 km at these latitudes, ap-
proximately the rupture length of an m ∼ 6 earthquake.
The average intensity of activity I(x, t0, t2) is constructed
by computing the number of earthquakes n(x, t0, t2) in
each coarse-grained box centered at x since records be-
gan at time t0 = 1932 until a later time t2 that will be
allowed to vary: I(x, t0, t2) = n(x, t0, t2). We then re-
gard Pµ ≡ Pµ(x, t0, t2) = I(x, t0, t2)/
I(x, t0, t2)dx as a
probability for the location of future events m ≥ mT for
times t > t2. Previous work [13, 14, 15] indicates that
Pµ is a good predictor of locations for future large events
having m ≥ 5.

R

The intensity change map builds upon the intensity
map by computing the average squared change in inten-
sity over a time interval ∆t = t2 − t1. Here we use
∆t = 13 years [13, 14]. We compute n(x, tb, t1) and
n(x, tb, t2) for the two times t1 and t2, where t2 > t1,
beginning at a base time tb, where t1 > tb > t0. Comput-
ing the change in numbers of events as ∆n(x, tb, t1, t2) =
n(x, tb, t2) − n(x, tb, t1), we then deﬁne the intensity
change ∆I(x, t1, t2) by normalizing ∆n(x, tb, t1, t2) to
have spatial mean zero and unit variance, yielding
∆n′(x, tb, t1, t2), and then averaging ∆n′(x, tb, t1, t2)
over all values for tb from t0 to t1: ∆I(x, t1, t2) =<
∆n′(x, tb, t1, t2) >tb. The corresponding probability is
P∆ ≡ P∆(x, t1, t2) = [∆I(x, t1, t2)]2/
[∆I(x, t1, t2)]2dx.
Previous work [13, 14, 15] has found that P∆ is also a
good predictor of locations for future large events having
m ≥ 5. P∆ can be viewed as a probability based upon
the squared change in intensity.

ing [15, 16]. We construct binary forecasts for m ≥ mc
and for times t > t2, where mc is a cutoﬀ magnitude. In
past work [13, 14, 15] we have taken mc = 5, but we now
remove this restriction.
In our application, the prob-
abilities Pµ ≡ Pµ(x, t0, t2) and P∆ ≡ P∆(x, t1, t2) are
converted to binary forecasts Bµ ≡ Bµ(D, x, t0, t2) and
B∆ ≡ B∆(D, x, t1, t2) by the use of a decision threshold
D, where D ∈ [0, max{Pµ}] or D ∈ [0, max{P∆}] respec-
tively [15, 16].

For a given value of D, we set Bµ = 1 where Pµ > D
and Bµ = 0 otherwise. Similarly, we set B∆ = 1 where
P∆ > D and B∆ = 0 otherwise. The set of pixels
{xµ(D)} where Bµ = 1 and {x∆(D)} where B∆ = 1
then constitute locations where future events m ≥ mc are
considered to be likely to occur. We call these locations
hotspots. The locations where Bµ = 0 and B∆ = 0 are
sites where future events m ≥ mc are unlikely to occur.
In previous work, intensity maps and intensity change
maps at a particular value of D were called Relative In-
tensity maps and Pattern Informatics maps. Examples
of binary forecast maps are shown in Figure 2A.

mc = 4.

RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC
(ROC) DIAGRAMS

A series of D-dependent contingency tables are con-
structed using the set of locations {xq(mc)} where the
q = 1, . . . , Q large events m ≥ mc are observed to actu-
ally occur during the forecast veriﬁcation period t > t2.
The contingency table has 4 entries, a → d, whose values
are determined by some speciﬁed rule set [15, 16]. Here
we use the following rules for given D (same rules for
both “µ” and “∆” subscripts):

1. a is the number of boxes in {x(D)} which are also

in {xq(mc)}

2. b is the number of boxes in {x(D)} whose location
is not in {xq(mc)}, i.e., is in the complement to
{xq(mc)}

3. c is the number of boxes in the complement to

{x(D)} whose location is in {xq(mc)}

4. d is the number of boxes in the complement to
{x(D)} whose locations are in the complement to
{xq(mc)}

The hit rate is then deﬁned as H = a/(a + c), and the
false alarm rate is deﬁned as F = b/(b + d). Note that
with these deﬁnitions, a + c = Q, a + b = number of
hotspots, and a + b + c + d = N .

The ROC diagram [15, 16] is a plot of the points
{H, F } as D is varied. Examples of ROC curves cor-
responding to the intensity and intensity change maps
in Figure 2A are shown in Figure 2B. A perfect forecast
of occurrence (perfect order, no ﬂuctuations) would con-
sist of two line segments, the ﬁrst connecting the points
(H, F ) = (0, 0) to (H, F ) = (1, 0), and the second con-
necting (H, F ) = (1, 0) to (H, F ) = (1, 1). A curve of this
type can be described as maximum possible hits (H = 1)
with minimum possible false alarms (F = 0). Another
type of perfect forecast (perfect order, no ﬂuctuations)
consists of two lines connecting the points (0, 0) to (0, 1)
and (0, 1) to (1, 1), a perfect forecast of non-occurrence.
The line H = F occupies a special status, and corre-
sponds to a completely random forecast [15, 16] (max-
imum disorder, maximum ﬂuctuations) where the false
alarm rate is the same as the hit rate and no information
is produced by the forecast. Alternatively, we can say
that the marginal utility [17] of an additional hotspot,
dH/dF , equals unity for a random forecast.

For a given time-dependent forecast H(F, t), we con-
sider the time-dependent Pierce Skill Score H(F, t) − F
[16], which measures the improvement in performance of
H(F, t) relative to the random forecast H = F . A Pierce
function Ψ(t) measures the area between H(F, t) and the
random forecast:

Fmax

Z
0

= A(t) − F 2

max/2,

where

A(t) =

H(F, t)dF.

The upper limit Fmax on the range if integration is a
parameter whose value is set by the requirement that the
marginal utility [17] of the forecast of occurrence H(F, t)
exceeds that of the random forecast H = F :

d
dF

{H(F, t) − F } > 0.

(3)

Since H(F, t) curves are monotonically increasing, Fmax
is determined as the value of F for which dH(F, t)/dF =
1. For the forecasts we consider, we ﬁnd that Fmax ≈ 0.2,
as can be seen from the examples in Figure 2B.

ORDER PARAMETER AND GENERALIZED
GINZBURG CRITERION

We deﬁne an order parameter as the Pierce func-
tion Ψτ (t) obtained using as the probability Pτ ≡

3

Pτ (x, t1, t2) = n(x, t1, t2)/
n(x, t1, t2)dx, where Pτ is
R
the average normalized intensity of seismic activity dur-
ing t1 to t2. Using Pτ and the decision threshold D, we
construct a binary forecast Bτ ≡ Bτ (D, x, t1, t2) . Eval-
uating the forecast Bτ during the time interval t2 to t
produces the ROC diagram Hτ (F, t). For the case of
forecasts having positive marginal utility relative to the
random forecast, Ψτ (t) > 0. If past seismic activity is un-
correlated with future seismic activity, Pτ is equivalent
to a random forecast, and Ψτ (t) = 0

Corresponding to the order parameter Ψτ (t), we deﬁne
a function G(t) to indicate the relative importance of ﬂuc-
tuations with respect to forecasts of occurrence. We note
that the probability Ψ∆ is a measure of the mean squared
change of intensity, a measure of ﬂuctuations in seismic
intensity, during t1 to t2, and that the probability Pµ is
a measure of the average intensity over the entire time
history (t0 to t2). We will refer to P∆ as the “ﬂuctuation
map” or “change map”, and Pµ as the “average map”.
Using the corresponding ROC functions we deﬁne

G(t) ≡

Ψ∆(t)
Ψµ(t)

,

(4)

where Ψ∆(t) is based upon the ROC curve computed
using P∆, {H∆(F, t), F } and Ψµ(t) is based upon the
ROC curve computed using Pµ, {Hµ(F, t), F }. We can
say that when G(t) < 1, “ﬂuctuations are less signiﬁcant
relative to the mean” in the sense that the ﬂuctuation
map provides a poorer forecast than the mean map. This
statement is equivalent to the Pierce diﬀerence function:

This diﬀerence function can be considered to be a gener-
alized Ginzburg criterion [12].

To examine these ideas, we compare a plot of G(t)
with activity of major earthquakes (m ≥ 6) in Califor-
nia. We ﬁrst consider the Gutenberg-Richter frequency-
magnitude relation f = 10a · 10−bm, where f is the num-
ber of events per unit time with magnitude larger than m
and a and b are constants. a speciﬁes the level of activity
in the region, and b ∼= 1.

To construct ROC curves, we consider t to be the cur-
rent time at each time step and test the average map
and change map by forecasting locations of earthquakes
during t2 to t. We use events having m ≥ mT , where
mT is some threshold magnitude. Note that f −1 speci-
ﬁes a time scale for events larger than m: 1 event with
m ≥ 6.0 is associated on average with 10 m ≥ 5.0 events,
100 m ≥ 4.0 events, etc. Without prior knowledge of
the optimal value for mT , we average the results for a
scale-invariant distribution of 1000 mT ≥ 3.0 events, 794
mT ≥ 3.1 events, 631 mT ≥ 3.2 events, . . ., 10 mT ≥ 5.0
events. We terminate the sequence at mT ≥ 5.0 due
to increasingly poor statistics. To control the number
of earthquakes with m ≥ mT in the snapshot window

Ψ(t) =

(H(F, t) − F )dF

(1)

∆A(t) ≡ Aµ(t) − A∆(t) > 0.

(5)

(t2 to t), we determine the value of t2 that most closely
produces the desired number of events within the snap-
shot window. It is possible to have ﬂuctuations in actual
number of events if the snapshot window includes the oc-
currence time of a major earthquake, when there may be
many events m ≥ mT in the coarse-grained time intervals
of length 1 day following the earthquake.

A central idea is that the length of the snapshot win-
dow is not ﬁxed in time; it is instead ﬁxed by earthquake
number at each threshold magnitude mT = 3.0, 3.1, 3.2,
and so forth. Nature appears to measure “earthquake
time” in numbers of events, rather than in years. “Earth-
quake time” is evidently based on stress accumulation
and release, that is, earthquake numbers, rather than in
months or years [10].

Results are shown in Figure 3 for the region of Cal-
ifornia shown in Figure 1. At top of either plot is the
Pierce diﬀerence function ∆A(t) = Aµ(t)− A∆(t), and at
bottom is earthquake magnitude plotted as a function of
time from 1 January 1960 to 31 March 2006. The vertical
lines in each top panel are the times of all events m ≥ 6 in
the region during that time interval. It can be seen from
Figures 1 and 3 that there are 11 m ≥ 6 events in north-
ern California and 10 such events in southern California.
For both areas, these major events are concentrated into
8 distinct “episodes” corresponding to 8 main shocks. In
each plot, 7 of the 8 major episodes fall during (“black”)
time intervals where ∆A(t) > 0, or they either begin or
terminate such a time interval. If a binomial probability
distribution is assumed, the chance that random cluster-
ing of these major earthquake episodes could produce this
temporal concordance can be computed. For Figure 3A,
where black time intervals constitute 36.8% of the to-
tal, we compute a 0.46% chance that the concordance is
due to random clustering. For Figure 3B, the respective
numbers are 19% of the total time interval, and 0.0058%
chance due to random clustering. Our results support the
prediction that major earthquake episodes preferentially
occur during time intervals when ﬂuctuations in seismic
intensity, as measured by ROC curves, are less important
than the average seismic intensity.

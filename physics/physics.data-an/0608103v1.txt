A stochastic analysis of ﬁnancial data is presented. In particular we investigate how the statistics
of log returns change with diﬀerent time delays τ . The scale dependent behaviour of ﬁnancial data
can be divided into two regions. The ﬁrst time-range, the small-timescale region (in the range
of seconds) seems to be characterized by universal features. The second time-range, the medium-
timescale range from several minutes upwards and can be characterized by a cascade process, which
is given by a stochastic Markov process in the scale τ . A corresponding Fokker-Planck equation can
be extracted from given data and provides a non equilibrium thermodynamical description of the
complexity of ﬁnancial data.

INTRODUCTION

SMALL SCALE ANALYSIS

One of the remarkable features of the complexity of the
ﬁnancial market is that very often ﬁnancial quantities
display non-Gaussian statistics often denoted as heavy
tailed or intermittent statistics, for further details see
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].

To characterize the ﬂuctuations of a ﬁnancial time se-
ries x(t), most commonly quantities like returns,
log-
returns or price increments are used. Here, we con-
sider the statistics of the log return y(τ ) over a certain
timescale τ , which is deﬁned as:

y(τ ) = log x(t + τ ) − log x(t).

(1)

where x(t) denotes the price of the asset at time t. We
suppressed the dependence of the log return y(τ ) on the
time t, since we assume the underlying stochastic process
to be stationary. In this paper we present mainly results
for Bayer for the time span of 1993 to 2003. The ﬁnancial
data sets were provided by the Karlsruher Kapitalmarkt
Datenbank (KKMDB) [10]. The graph of the logarithm
of the price time series is shown in Fig. 1.

First we look at the statistics of p(y(τ )) as shown in
Fig. 2. Here we ﬁnd the remarkable feature of ﬁnancial
data that the probability density functions (pdfs) are not
Gaussian, but exhibit heavy tailed shapes. Another re-
markable feature is the change of the shape with the size
of the scale variable τ . To analyse the changing statistics
of the pdfs with the scale τ a non-parametric approach
is chosen. The distance between the pdf p(y(τ )) on a
timescale τ and a pdf pT (y(T )) on a reference timescale
T is computed. As a reference timescale, T = 1sec is
chosen. In order to look only at the shape of the pdfs
and to exclude eﬀects due to varying mean and variance,
all pdfs p(y(τ )) have been normalized to a zero mean and
a standard deviation of 1.

As a measure to quantify the distance between two
distributions p(y(τ )) and pT (y(T )), the Kullback-Leibler-
Entropy [11]

is used. In Fig. 3 the evolution of dK with increasing
τ is shown, which measures the change of the shape of
the pdfs. For diﬀerent stocks we found that for timescales
smaller than about one minute a linear growth of the dis-
tance measure seems to be universally present, see Fig.
3a. If as a reference distribution a normalised Gaussian
distribution is taken, the fast deviation from the Gaus-
sian shape in the small timescale regime becomes evident,
as displayed in Fig. 3b. The independence of this small
scale behaviour on the particular choice of the measure
and on the choice of the stock is shown in [12].

III. MEDIUM SCALE ANALYSIS

Next the behaviour for larger timescales (τ > 1min)
is discussed. Here we proceed the analysis with the idea
of a cascade. As has been shown by [9, 13, 14] it is

possible to grasp the complexity of ﬁnancial data by cas-
cade processes running in the variable τ . In particular
it has been shown that it is possible to estimate directly
from given data a stochastic cascade process in form of
a Fokker-Planck equation [13, 14]. The underlying idea
of this approach is to access statistics of all orders of
the ﬁnancial data by the general joint n-scale probabil-
ity densities p(y1, τ1; y2, τ2; ...; yN , τN ) (Here we use the
shorthand notation y1 = y(τ1) and take without loss of
generality τi < τi+1. The smaller log returns y(τi) are
nested inside the larger log returns y(τi+1) with common
end point t.)

The

joint pdfs

can be
expressed as well by
the multiple

densities
p(yi, τi|yi+1, τi+1; ...; yN , τN ).
This very general n-
scale characterization of a data set, which contains the
general n-point statistics, can be simpliﬁed essentially
if there is a stochastic process in τ , which is a Markov
process. This is the case if the conditional probability
densities fulﬁl the following relations:

p(y1, τ1|y2, τ2; y3, τ3; . . . yN , τN ) = p(y1, τ1|y2, τ2). (3)

Consequently,

p(y1, τ1; ...; yN , τN ) =

p(y1, τ1|y2, τ2) · ... · p(yN −1, τN −1|yN , τN ) · p(yN , τN )

holds.

for Markov processes.

Equation (4) indicates the importance of the con-
ditional pdf
Knowledge of
p(y, τ |y0, τ0) (for arbitrary scales τ and τ0 with τ <
τ0) is suﬃcient to generate the entire statistics of the
increment, encoded in the N-point probability density
p(y1, τ1; y2, τ2; . . . ; yN , τN ).

For Markov processes the conditional probability den-
sity satisﬁes a master equation, which can be put into
the form of a Kramers-Moyal expansion for which the
Kramers-Moyal coeﬃcients D(k)(y, τ ) are deﬁned as the
limit ∆τ → 0 of the conditional moments M (k)(y, τ, ∆τ ):

For a general stochastic process, all Kramers-Moyal co-
eﬃcients are diﬀerent from zero. According to Pawula’s
theorem, however, the Kramers-Moyal expansion stops
after the second term, provided that the fourth order co-
eﬃcient D(4)(y, τ ) vanishes. In that case, the Kramers-
Moyal expansion reduces to a Fokker-Planck equation
(also known as the backwards or second Kolmogorov
equation):

assuming that the Kramers-Moyal coeﬃcients are con-
stant with respect to the timescale τ in each of these
sub intervals of the timescale. We started with a small-
est timescale of 240s and continued in such a way that
τi = 0.9 · τi+1. The Kramers-Moyal coeﬃcients them-
selves were parameterised in the following form:

D(1) = α0 + α1y
D(2) = β0 + β1y + β2y2.

(9)

The coeﬃcients we obtained by this procedure are shown
in Fig. 4. This result shows that the rich and com-
plex structure of ﬁnancial data, expressed by multiscale
statistics, can be pinned down to coeﬃcients with a quite
simple functional form.

To show the quality of our results we reconstruct
the measured statistics by the estimated Fokker-Planck
equations. At ﬁrst, the conditional probability densi-
ties p(y(τi)|y(τi+1)) were reconstructed. As an example
the conditional probability density p(y(τ = 3389s)|y(τ =
3766s)) is shown in Fig. 5. The reconstructed condi-
tional probability density and the one calculated directly
from the data are in good agreement. As a next step
we used the pdf on the scale of τ = 27900s and the
reconstructed conditional probability densities to calcu-
late the increment pdfs on timescales between four min-
utes and one hour. The results for the timescales of
τ = 3766s, 1800s, 955s, 454s and 240s are shown in Fig.
2. Again the agreement between unconditional probabil-
ity densities p(y(τ )) of the original data (dots) and the
reconstructed ones (broken lines) is very good.

seems to exhibit a well deﬁned structure, expressed by
the very simple functional form of the Kullback-Leibler
entropy with respect to the timescale τ .

Based on a stochastic analysis we have shown that a
second time range, the medium scale range exists, where
multiscale joint probability densities can be expressed by
a stochastic cascade process. Here the information on
the comprehensive multiscale statistics can be expressed
by simple conditioned probability densities. This simpli-

4

ﬁcation may be seen in analogy to the thermodynamical
description of a gas by means of statistical mechanics.
The comprehensive statistical quantity for the gas is the
joint n-particle probability density, describing the loca-
tion and the momentum of all the individual particles.
One essential simpliﬁcation for the kinetic gas theory is
the single particle approximation. The Boltzmann equa-
tion is an equation for the time evolution of the proba-
bility density p(p, t) in one-particle phase space, where
x and p are position and momentum, respectively.
In
analogy to this we have obtained for the ﬁnancial data a
Fokker-Planck equation for the scale τ evolution of con-
ditional probabilities, p(yi, τi|yi+1, τi+1). In our cascade
picture the conditional probabilities can not be reduced
further to single probability densities, p(yi, τi), without
loss of information, as it is done for the kinetic gas theory.
As a last point we want to mention that based on the
information of the Fokker-Planck equation it is possible
to generate artiﬁcial data sets. As pointed out in [15],
the knowledge of conditional probabilities can be used to
generate time series. One important point is that one
uses increments y(τ ) with common right endpoints. By
the knowledge of the n-scale conditional probability den-
sity of all y(τi) the stochastically correct next point can
be selected. We could show that time series for turbulent
data generated by this procedure even reproduces quite
well the conditional probability densities, as the central
quantity for a comprehensive multiscale characterization.

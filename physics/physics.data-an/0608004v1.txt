Abstract

We investigated the critical dynamics on the daily Taiwan stock exchange index (TSE) from

1971 to 2005, and the 5-min intraday data from 1996 to 2005. A global persistence exponent θp

was deﬁned for non-equilibrium critical phenomena [1, 2], and describing dynamic behavior in an

economic index [3].

In recent numerical analysis studies of literatures, it is illustrated that the persistence probability
has a universal scaling form P (t) ∼ t−θp [4]. In this work, we analyzed persistence properties of

universal scaling behavior on Taiwan ﬁnancial market, and also calculated the global persistence

exponent θp. We found our analytical results in good agreement with the same universality.

INTRODUCTION

Problems in economy and ﬁnance have attracted the interest of statistical physicists all

over the world. Using the tools developed for statistical physics, like phase transitions, criti-

cal exponents, mean ﬁeld approximations, renormalization group [5], persistence probability

[6, 7, 8].

In recent years the detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) method [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] has

become a widely used technique for the determination of (mono-) fractal scaling properties

and the detection of long-range correlations in noisy, nonstationary time series [11]. In many

of non-equilibrium systems, the persistence has been found to decay as a power-law at time
series, P (t) ∼ t−θp. Hurst exponent and persistence exponent in these ﬁnancial time series

are investigated in numerical and analytical [8].

We calculated the experimental data with the daily Taiwan stock exchange index (TSE)

from 1971 to 2005, and the 5-min intraday data from 1996 to 2005. In this work, we analyzed

persistence properties of universal scaling behavior on Taiwan ﬁnancial market.

II. METHOD

We consider a set of data recorded the daily Taiwan stock exchange index (TSE) from

1971 to 2005. Let Yi(t) be the stock index at discrete times i, i = 1, 2, ..., tn − 1. The ﬁnal

transaction time is denoted by tn. Then, the log-return price is deﬁned as

ri(t) = ln Yi(t + ∆t) − ln Yi(t),

(1)

where ∆t is time interval. In this paper, we analyzed daily data; ∆t = 1 day.

Let us denote the value of the TSE at a certain time t′ as y(t′). P+(t) is the probability
that the value of the TSE has never gone down to the value y(t′) in time t, y(t′+N∆t) > y(t′)

for N = 1, 2, ..., t. i.e., P−(t) is the probability that the value of the TSE has never gone up
to the value y(t′) in time t, y(t′ +N∆t) < y(t′) for N = 1, 2, ..., t. The persistence probability

P (t) is [P+(t) + P−(t)]/2.

The persistence probability has a power-law behavior

P (t) ∼ t−θp.

III. DISCUSS AND RESULTS

A ”persistence exponent” θp is deﬁned for non-equilibrium critical phenomena. Based on

large amounts of data compiled in past years, especially those records in minutes or seconds,

it becomes possible to perform relatively accurate analysis and to study the ﬁne structure

of the dynamics. In Fig. 2 and 3, we observe the persistence probability that at least up to

least up to 250. The slope of persistence probability P (t) estimation from the initial time

to 200.

The price evolution is multifractal if the exponent hierarchy Hq varies with q, otherwise

is fractal in the theory of surface dynamical scaling referred to as multiaﬃne and self-aﬃne,

respectively.

In particular, for q = 2, we recover the fractional Brownian motion case

described by the well-known Hurst exponent, 0 < H2 < 1. The bridge between these two

analyses is provided by the second-order Hurst exponent H2 associated with the correlation

function of the stock price, which has been shown to be simply related to the persistence

exponent through H2 = 1 − θp.

We note that this relation holds for any zero-mean process (not necessarily Gaussian

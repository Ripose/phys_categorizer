We show that we may generalize the Ursel l-Mayer statistial mehanis so that it may

over also the unique statistis of Internet websites. Our starting point is the intro-

dution of an extra variable that is assumed to take aount, as wil l be explained, of

the unique nature of the Internet statistis. We then show, fol lowing the arguments in

Mayer, that one may obtain a phase transition-like phenomena.

Introdution

The use of the Internet as a neessary tool for easing the appliation of an inreasing number

of diverse tasks, and not only for web sur(cid:28)ng, is fastly growing. There has been lately an

ongoing researh that disuss the Internet topology [1℄ and among other things also its

resiliene under intentional attak [2℄. Use has been made of the fratal [3, 4℄ and the

perolation theories [5, 6℄ and the Internet web sites are regarded as its building bloks.

These works disuss the Internet as random network [4, 5℄.

We fous our attention here on the sites themselves and take into aount their unique

nature ompared to that of fratals. An important harateristi of Internet websites is the

possible existene in them of any number of links whih refer to other sites that may be

1 INTRODUCTION

downloaded by a single lik of the omputer mouse. Moreover, whereas any fratal is built

by repeated iteration (see Aharony in [5℄) of some unique natural "mirosopi" growth rule,

the ase of the Internet is di(cid:27)erent. This is beause not only the forms of the onstituent

websites, the identity and onnetivity [4, 5, 6℄ of their links depend only on the programmers

that write the relevant softwares (and not upon any natural rule) but also the growth of the

web itself depends exlusively upon them. Thus, we must take into aount this harateristi

of the programming that enables one to display on the two dimensional sreen pratially

anything.

In other words, the nonphysial harater of the Internet websites, ompared

for example to the partiles in an N partile system, auses one to disuss them in terms

appropriate and adapted to their unique nature. For that purpose we introdue a speial

variable, denoted in the following by s, that have a role analogous to that of the spatial

variable r whih is used to disuss the statistis of the N partile system. The harater of

this variable s will be disussed in the following setion.

We note that similar situations arise in the disussion of some mathematial [7℄ and

physial [8℄ situations for whih one have to add a speial variable that takes aount of some

nonphysial properties of the disussed systems. For example, in the funtional generalization

[9℄ of Quantum Mehanis the generalized Hilbert spae (the Lax-Phillips one [8℄) is obtained

by adding an extra variable to the onventional Hilbert spae. A similar addition of an extra

variable has been proposed by Parisi-Wu [10, 11℄ in their stohasti quantization theory.

This theory assumes that some stohati proess [12℄ ours in the extra dimension and that

the physial laws are obtained from those involving this additional variable in the limit when

all its values are set equal to eah other and taken to in(cid:28)nity.

As known, any web site ontains one or more web pages and eah of these may inlude

one or more links to other plaes on the same page or to other sites or other web servers.

The user that liks, through the keyboard, on any link downloads its relevant site to the

sreen. The number of the links in a web site may be small (or even zero for the unlinked

web sites) or it may be very large. We do not onsider here the seondary links that may be

1 INTRODUCTION

found on the sites refered to by the (cid:28)rst links.

Our aim in this work is to show that if we onsider large lusters of mutually linked

sites then adding even a very small amount of onneting links results in an unproportional

phase-transition-like inrease of the total onnetivity [4, 5℄ of these lusters. We use, for

that purpose, a generalized version of the Ursell [13℄ and Mayer [14, 15℄ statistial mehanis.

This generalization is obtained by the introdution of the remarked extra variable that takes

aount of the unique Internet statistis. We note that similar disussion in Ursell [13℄ and

Mayer [14℄ with regard to the large lusters of partiles results in demonstrating phase-

transition phenomena [13, 14, 15℄.

The system we wish to disuss here is a large ensemble of omputers that are onneted

to the Internet. We assume that these omputers at on a sharing basis so that all the (cid:28)les

of eah one are potentially shared by all of them and any (cid:28)le of any kind may be downloaded

by eah one. There exist in the web dozens of appropriate softwares that enable this kind

of sharing and free downloading of all kinds of (cid:28)les (for example, the now non-existent

Napster.om that enables all the omputers that use its software to free-download musi).

These softwares, when ativated by any one of the sharing users that searhes for a spei(cid:28)

information in any form (softwares, media (cid:28)les, video (cid:28)les et), suggest a list of possible

addresses (URL's) that refer to other users that have this information. The requested (cid:28)les

(sites) may be downloaded and the uploading one hosen is generally that whith a large rate

of downloading that is onneted most of the time to the Internet so that the downloading

proess will not be interrupted. We show, as remarked, that when the members of the

ensemble form a large linked luster then adding to them even a very small amount of

onneting links results in an unproportional strengthening of their overall onnetivity in

the sense that eah of them is found to have the same (cid:28)nite group of (cid:28)les.

Note that we have used alternately the terms (cid:28)le and site on the same basis although

the (cid:28)rst is used to mean a more disrete doument that belongs to the user that writes it

as ompared to the Internet sites that may be aessed by any one. This is so beause, as

2 THE INTERNET STATISTICS

4

noted, we disuss the shared ensemble of users, any one of them may have aess to the (cid:28)les

of the others, so these (cid:28)les are, in this respet, the same as the Internet websites.

In Setion 2 we disuss the Internet using the partition funtion method [14, 15, 16℄ where

the relevant "on(cid:28)guration integral" is disussed by adapting the luster formalism of Ursell

[13℄ and Mayer [14℄. The integrals inluded in the (cid:16)on(cid:28)guration integral(cid:17) are expressed

with respet to the extra variable s. We follow the disussion in [14℄, with respet to the N

partile system, exept for the neessary hanges imposed by the unique nature of sub jet

dealt with here. We show that if we have a large onneted luster of sites then enhaning,

even slightly, its onnetivity [4, 5℄ results in a phase transition-like ontribution of this

luster to the (cid:16)on(cid:28)guration integral(cid:17) ompared to its ontribution without this small added

onnetivity.

2 The Internet statistis

We adapt in the following for our websites system the virial expansion of the equation of state

[15, 16℄ whih is disussed by using the luster formalism developed (cid:28)rst by Ursell [13℄ and

generalized by Mayer [14℄. We assume that the web sites system disussed here is omposed

of N sites where N is generally a large number. We note that in Statistial Mehanis when

one disuss the potential energy of the N partile system in the on(cid:28)guration spae [15, 16℄

the relevant variable is the distane rij between any two partiles i and j whih depends only

on their positions so that the potential between them u(rij) is assumed to be e(cid:27)etive for

small ranges of rij and vanishes when rij grows. Here, also for the N site system we denote

by u(sij) the "potential" between the two sites i and j whih depends upon the "distane",

denoted here by sij , between them. This (cid:16)distane(cid:17) signi(cid:28)es how muh these sites di(cid:27)er

from eah other so that it is shorter the more (cid:16)similar(cid:17) they are and longer for unrelated

sites. The distane between i and j may be assigned a quantitative aspet by taking into

2 THE INTERNET STATISTICS

5

aount the number of ommon links to both so that the more large this number is the

more short this distane is. Thus, eah site i is haraterized by all its links so that its

"position" in s spae may be written as si(si1, si2, si3, . . .), where, si1 , si2 , si3 et denote the

links in i to the sites 1, 2, 3, et, and the "distane" between i and j , for example, may be

written as sij(si1, si2, . . . , sj1, sj2, . . .) = si(si1, si2 . . .) − sj(sj1, sj2, . . .). Thus, we an de(cid:28)ne

a "potential" u(sij), in analogy to the N partile system, for example, as

u(sij) =

1
si(si1, si2, . . .) − sj(sj1, sj2, . . .)

(1)

The potential u(sij) from the last equation, as for the orrespondent u(rij), is e(cid:27)etive for

small (cid:16)distanes(cid:17) sij and vanishes when sij grows. However, in ontrast to the N partile

system in whih the distane rij between any two members i and j is sharply and uniquely

determined by their positions only here the "distane" between any two sites is also hara-

terized, as has been remarked, by other links to other sites that are ommon to both, besides

the links that refer to eah other. Moreover, a site may have a link to another one whereas

the seond have no link to the (cid:28)rst in whih ase the (cid:28)rst is linked to the seond whih is

not linked to the (cid:28)rst. Thus, in order to disuss appropriately the potential between any

two sites i and j one must di(cid:27)erentiate between four di(cid:27)erent situations: 1): i has a link to

j and j has no one to i. 2): j has a link to i and i has no one to j . 3): both i and j have no

links to eah other. 4): both i and j have links to eah other in whih ase the onnetivity

between them is larger than in ases 1 and 2. Analogously to the N partile system, the

states of the N site ensemble and the orrelation among them may be determined from the

fundamental (cid:16)partition funtion(cid:17) [15, 16℄ of statistial mehanis

Z =

2 THE INTERNET STATISTICS

where QN (V (s)) is the (cid:16)on(cid:28)guration integral(cid:17) in s spae given by [15, 14℄

QN (V (s)) =

Z Z

. . .

Z

e−V (s)ds1ds2 . . . dsN

(3)

The variable s denotes that we disuss Internet sites and f (s) is generally an exponential fun-

tion that does not depend upon the potential V (s). Eah of the di(cid:27)erentials ds1ds2 . . . dsN

signi(cid:28)es an in(cid:28)nitesimal volume element in s-spae. Thus, if we assume, analogously to

the on(cid:28)guration spae of the N partile system, that this spae may be pro jeted into

three axes denoted by a1, a2 and a3 then the i di(cid:27)erential in Eq (3) may be written as

dsi = dsia1dsia2dsia3 . Now, sine the variable s denotes the (cid:16)position(cid:17) in s-spae so that sij

is, as remarked, the (cid:16)distane(cid:17) between the sites i and j in terms of how muh they are sim-

ilar to eah other then we may regard the integrals in Eq (3) as integrated over all distanes

from a referene site whih is analogous to the origin of the on(cid:28)guration spae. And as this

origin is assigned the zero value so the referene site may be haraterized as the unliked

one. Note that our disussion in this work is general in that we do not speify the nature

and identity of the relevant sites. The quantity to be disussed exlusively in this work, as

in [14℄ with respet to the N partile system, is the important (cid:16)on(cid:28)guration integral(cid:17) from

Eq (3) that takes aount through V (s) of the numbering proedure suitable for the linked

sites. The potential V (s), as in [14℄, is assumed to be written as a sum of terms eah of whih

depends on the (cid:16)distane(cid:17) sij between any two sites i and j whih denotes, as remarked, the

onnetivity between them. Now, sine eah two sites may be onneted to eah other in

three di(cid:27)erent ways as in the situations 1, 2, and 4 in the disussion before Eq (2) we get the

result that in a system of N sites there are

3N (N −1)
2

di(cid:27)erent pairs, ompared to the

possible di(cid:27)erent pairs in the N partile system, so that the potential is

The (cid:28)rst double sum takes aount of the N(N − 1) pairs that are singly onneted to eah

other and the seond overs the

N (N −1)
2

that are doubly onneted and u(sij) is the potential

of the pair of sites i and j as a funtion of the (cid:16)distane(cid:17) sij between them. Note that the

number of doubly onneted pairs is half that of the singly onneted ones sine a single

onnetion between any two sites i and j may be realized in two di(cid:27)erent ways (see the

situations 1, and 2 in the former disussion) ompared to the double onnetion between

them whih is realized in only one way. We de(cid:28)ne, as done when disussing the luster

funtion theory [13, 14, 15℄, the funtion fij (whih has nothing to do with the f (s) of Eq

(2))

fij = f (sij) = e−u(sij) − 1

(5)

We see that fij = 0 for a large (cid:16)distane(cid:17) sij (unrelated web sites) where u(sij) tends to zero

(see Eq (1)). Note that when the sites i and j have no links to eah other (unrelated sites)

then they, naturally, also have no other ommon links so that fij and u(sij) are both zero.

Also, as one may imagine the probability to (cid:28)nd two di(cid:27)erent sites that are entirely idential

to eah other is very small so that u(sij) in this ase beomes very large (see Eq (1)) suh

that f (sij) ≈ −1. By fij we denote also the one-way onnetion from site i to site j when

there is a link in i to j , and the double onnetion between them is denoted by fijfji where,

obviously, we have (see Eqs (1) and (5)) fij 6= fji . The (cid:16)on(cid:28)guration integral(cid:17) from Eq (3)

beomes using the last equations

(6)

Note that due to the speial harater of the websites, as disussed after Eq (1), the ounting

relation between the general sites i and j is as written in the subsript of the summation

sign of the last equation (ompare with the analogous expression in the N partile system

(see Eq (13.3) in p. 277 in [14℄)).

In order to be able to ope with the terms under the parentheses signs in Eq (6) we

2 THE INTERNET STATISTICS

8

use a somewhat extended version of the luster theory developed by [13℄ and [14℄ for the

imperfet gas and interating (cid:29)uids (see also [15℄) in whih a one to one orrespondene is

made between the terms under the parentheses signs in Eq (6) and ertain planar diagrams.

For example, the diagram shown in Figure 1 for N = 24 orresponds to the term in Eq

(6) that involves f1,2 , f3,4 , f5,6 , f9,10 , f11,12 , f11,19 , f12,19 , f12,20 , f13,20 , f15,16 , f15,23 , f16,23 ,

f16,24 , f19,20 and f23,24 (we have inserted ommas between the i and j omponents of fij ).

As seen from the diagram the sites (denoted in this paragraph by square parentheses) are

assembled in lusters, so that the sites [7℄, [8℄, [14℄, and [22℄ eah onstitutes a single luster

of 1 member. The sites [1℄[2℄, [5℄[6℄, and [17℄[18℄ are in lusters of two where the pairs [1℄[2℄

and [17℄[18℄ are doubly onneted . The sites [3℄[4℄[9℄[10℄ and [15℄[16℄[23℄[24℄ are lusters of 4

where the members of the (cid:28)rst are singly onneted to eah other whereas those of the seond

are doubly onneted. The sites [11℄[12℄[13℄[19℄[20℄[21℄ onstitute a six-member luster. As

seen from Figure 1 the sites in a luster are onneted in a di(cid:27)erent manner to eah other

so that one may be doubly onneted to all the other sites of the luster in whih ase its

onnetivity is maximal whereas another may be singly onneted to only one site so that

its onnetivity is minimal. For example, in the six member luster of Figure 1 the site [20℄

is doubly onneted to the sites [11℄, [12℄, and [19℄ and singly onneted to [13℄ and [21℄,

whereas the sites [13℄ and [21℄ are eah singly onneted to only the site [20℄. This di(cid:27)erene

between the onneted sites and the less onneted ones is realized when one remove from

the luster one site and all its onneting lines. Thus, if the removed site is the densely

onneted one the onnetivity of the remained luster is weakened onsiderably whereas if

the removed site is lightly onneted the e(cid:27)et on the onnetivity of the remaining luster

is less in(cid:29)uential. For example, if the site [20℄ and all its onneting lines in the six-member

luster of Figure 1 is removed the luster is atually broken into three di(cid:27)erent smaller ones

whereas if either the site [13℄ (or [21℄) is removed together with its single onneting line the

onnetivity of the remaining 5-member luster is only slightly a(cid:27)eted.

We note that Figure 1 is reminisent of Fig 13.1 in page 278 in [14℄ whih shows a similar

2 THE INTERNET STATISTICS

9

diagram for 28 moleules. The prinipal di(cid:27)erene between the two diagrams is that in

Figure 13.1 in [14℄ the onnetion, if exists, between any two moleules is unique and not

direted as in the plane diagram of Figure 1 here. That is, as disussed after Eq (1) the

linking between any two sites may be of three kinds and the lines that onnet them have the

nature of vetors. We denote the number of times an l-sites luster appears in a term by ml

so that the total number N of all the sites may be written, as for the analogous N partile

system [14℄, as N =

l=N
l=1 lml . Note that the integrals over the sites in di(cid:27)erent lusters of

P

one term in Eq (6) are, as in the N partile system [14℄, independent of eah other. Thus,

the integral of a term in Eq (6) is the produt of the integrals over the sites in the same

luster where the meaning of the integral over the s variable is as disussed after Eq (3). As

in the N partile system [14℄, we sum the integrals of all the produts that our when a

spei(cid:28)ed l-sites are in one luster but, due to the unique harater of the Internet websites,

we divide this sum, denoted by bl , into two di(cid:27)erent parts as

bl = blm + bld =

l!S Z Z

(

Z X

fij +

fijfji)ds1 . . . dsl,

(7)

Yl≥i6=j≥1

Yl≥i>j≥1

where blm , bld denote the produts over the mixed and doubly onneted sites respetively.

By the term mixed we mean that the sites in the relevant luster may be either only singly

onneted or both singly and doubly onneted. Note the di(cid:27)erent ounting relations between

the general sites i and j for the mixed and doubly onneted sites as expressed respetively

in the subsripts of the two produt signs of Eq (7). The ounting relation of l ≥ i > j ≥ 1

for the doubly onneted sites, whih is the same as in the analogous N partile system (see

p. 277 in [14℄), is beause this kind of onnetion is unique and does not depend on diretion.

The number of fij in eah term of the blm ranges from a minimum of (l − 1) to a maximum

of (l(l − 1) − 1) and the orresponding number in the bld part ranges from a minimum of

2(l − 1) to a maximum of l(l − 1) where these numbers are always even for bld . The produt

l!S is a normalization fator and S is the total volume in s-spae of all the N sites (by small

The b3d is given by the (cid:28)rst four terms and b3m is given by the rest. Note that sine eah

mixed onnetion between any two sites may be, as remarked, of three kinds there are 50

terms in b3m whereas only 4 terms in b3d beause the double onnetion is unique.

We alulate, now, the number of terms ontributed to the (cid:16)on(cid:28)guration integral(cid:17) by

any spei(cid:28) bl . This ontribution is valid only when the sites in the same luster are linked to

eah other and is obtained by exploiting the speial harater of the bl from Eq (7) in order to

(cid:28)nd all the possible ways by whih it ontributes to the on(cid:28)guration integral. We take into

aount that the number of fij in the terms of bl ranges, as noted, from (l − 1) to l(l − 1) and

that eah fij denotes, as remarked, a link to site j in site i. Thus, the ontribution of eah bl

may be obtained by alulating the number of possible ways by whih eah of the quantities

of links (l − 1), l, . . . l(l − 1), may link l sites among them so as to onstrut an l-site luster.

We begin from the least linked l-luster whih is onstruted by using only (l − 1) di(cid:27)erent

links. The number of ways to onstrut suh luster is (we denote this number Wl(l − 1))

2 THE INTERNET STATISTICS

of Eq (7) ranges from (l − 1) to l(l − 1) we have, in order to (cid:28)nd all the possible di(cid:27)erent

ontributions of eah bl , to alulate also the Wl(l), Wl(l + 1) . . . Wl(l(l − 1)). Eah of these

is found by (cid:28)rst onstruting the minimally onneted l-luster from (l − 1) sites as in Eqs

(8) and sine eah site in the l-luster may be linked to all the other (l − 1) sites, exept to

itself, the next step is to link eah of the sites to all the others. That is, the total number

of ways to ompose an l luster using a number of links that ranges from (l − 1) to l(l − 1)

is Wl(l − 1) + Wl(l) + . . . + Wl(l + k) + . . . Wl(l(l − 1)). Wl(l − 1) in the former sum is

given by Eq (8) and eah one of the other W 's is obtained by noting that after omposing

the minimally linked l-luster using the (l − 1) links, from the possible l(l − 1), one remains

with l(l − 1) − (l − 1) = (l − 1)2

links. These links, in ontrast to the former least linked l

luster, may be formed so that it is allowed to ount also mutually linked sites suh as fij

and fji . That is, for alulating the number of ways to link these (l − 1)2

additional links

we may permute them instead of the former ombinations used for the initial (l − 1) links.

Thus, as remarked, for alulating Wl(l), . . . Wl(l + k), . . . Wl(l(l − 1)) we (cid:28)rst onstrut the

least linked l luster, using (l − 1) links as in Eq (8), and then we link the remaining links

whih range from 1 for Wl(l) to (l − 1)2

for Wl(l(l − 1)). For example, the number of possible

ways to onstrut an l site luster using (l + k) links, where 0 ≤ k ≤ l(l − 2) is given by the

reursive relation

Wl(l + k) = Wl(l + k − 1) · (l(l − 1) − (l + k − 1)) = Wl(l + k − 1) · ((l − 1)2 − k)

(9)

The fator (l(l − 1) − (l + k − 1)) in the middle expression is the number of ways to link

the remaining links, from the initial possible l(l − 1), after linking (l + k − 1) links. When

k = 0 we obtain from Eq (9) Wl(l) = Wl(l − 1) · (l − 1)2

. From the last equation one

obtains the number of ways for using l links, from a total of l(l − 1), to onstrut an l

luster where the (cid:28)rst (l − 1) links are used to initially ompose the least linked luster

and the additional link may be anyone from the remaining (l − 1)2

. When k = l(l − 2)

2 THE INTERNET STATISTICS

12

one obtains from Eq (9) Wl(l(l − 1)) = Wl(l(l − 1) − 1). Now, we an alulate the sum

Wl(l − 1) + Wl(l) + + + Wl(l + k) + + + Wl(l(l − 1)) in order to (cid:28)nd the number of ways by

whih one may build an l-site luster. That is, we write, using the former equations

Wl(l − 1) + Wl(l) + + + Wl(l + k) + + + Wl(l(l − 1)) =

= Wl(l − 1)[1 + (l − 1)2[1 + ((l − 1)2 − 1) + ((l − 1)2 − 1)((l − 1)2 − 2) + + +

The last result is the number of terms of bl and it is very large for large l. Thus, the total

ontribution to the (cid:16)on(cid:28)guration integral(cid:17) from eah spei(cid:28) l-luster is [14℄

whih is the expression obtained also for the N partile system (see p. 280 in [14℄) exept

that here we use the volume in s spae. The produt (l!S) has been introdued to anel

the e(cid:27)et of the normalization onstant (see Eq (7) and the disussion following it) and ml

is, as noted, the number of times an l-luster appears in a term. Now, we add all the similar

ontributions from the other l-site lusters and this is obtained by mutiplying the expression

from the last equation by

N !
ml!l! whih is the number of ways to distribute N di(cid:27)erent sites
into lusters so that m1 lusters have one site eah, m2 lusters have two sites eah ... and

partile system (see page 281 in [14℄)) is beause of the unique nature of the websites whih

are not only di(cid:27)erent from eah other but also render their lusters, even those with the

same number of sites, di(cid:27)erent. Thus, the division by

sites inside the lusters and the division by

where we have used the relation s = S

N whih is the volume in s spae per site. Compare Eq

(11) with the analogous expression for the N partile system (Eq (13.10) page 281 in [14℄).

As seen from the last equation the indies ml and l over whih the sum and the produt

are respetively run must satisfy the ondition [14℄

l=N
l=1 lml = N (see the disussion before

Eq (7)). Now, as may be realized from the last equations, there are many terms in bl that

represent lusters that are omposed of two parts that are onneted by only one site, so

that removing it splits the relevant integral into a produt of two. Thus, the luster integrals

bl 's may be simpli(cid:28)ed as in the N partile system [15, 14℄ by representing them as sums

of integrals that an not be further redued into a produt of integrals. That is, these

irreduible integrals, denoted as βk , orrespond to lusters all the members of whih are

more than singly onneted as follows

where, the produt is over all the sites that are onneted eah to at least two other sites.

Note that sine, as remarked, the onnetion between any two sites i and j is not unique

(see the disussion after Eq (1)) the ounting relation is as written in the subsript of the

produt sign and not k + 1 ≥ i > j ≥ 1 whih is appropriate for the N partile system (see

2 THE INTERNET STATISTICS

14

p. 287 in [14℄). As for the bl we di(cid:27)erentiate between βkm and βkd whih denote mixedly

and doubly onneted sites respetively where by the term mixedly we mean that the sites

in the relevant luster may be, as for the blm , either only singly onneted or both singly and

doubly onneted. From Eqs (5), (7) and (12) we see that the terms of blm and βkm may be

positive or negative depending upon the evenness or oddness respetively of the numbers of

fij in these terms . The terms of bld and βkd , on the other hand, are always positive sine

the number of their fij is always even.

The (cid:28)rst two βk , for example, are

(2f12 + f12f21)ds1ds2

(13)

The oe(cid:30)ients of 2, 6, and 12 signify the number of similar terms that di(cid:27)er only by the

diretion of the onneting lines between the sites. Thus, the term 6f32f31f21 denotes the

six possible di(cid:27)erent ways to onstrut a 3-luster from three singly onneted sites sine

eah of these sites may be onneted in two di(cid:27)erent ways to its neighbour. For example,

denoting these two neighbours by 1 and 2 the onnetion between them may be for the

singly onneted sites either f12 or f21 . Likewise, the term 12f32f23f31f21 denotes the 12

di(cid:27)erent possible ways to onstrut a 3-luster from two doubly onneted sites that are

singly onneted to the third. This is so sine there are 3 di(cid:27)erent ways to selet the two

doubly onneted sites from three and for eah of these there are four di(cid:27)erent ways to

singly onnet these two sites to the third one. Now, we an write any luster integral bl in

a manner analogous to the N partile system (see p. 288 in [14℄). That is, as a sum of terms

eah of whih depends upon the powers nk of the integrals βk where nk and k are related by

k=l−1
k=1 knk = l − 1. The −1 in the last relation is beause one site is left over due to the

P
de(cid:28)nition of βk (see the disussion before Eq (12), see also Eq (13.33) in [14℄). Thus, taking

We now follow the disussion in [14℄ with respet to the N partile system exept for

the required hanges due to the remarked unique nature of the websites. This is to show, as

shown in [14℄ for the N partile system, that one may obtain a phase-transition phenomenon.

We begin by using the Stirling approximation [17℄ for ln l!, ln ml!, ln k! and ln nk! so one may

write the logarithms of the general terms of the sums of Eqs (11) and (14), denoted by ln Tb

and ln Tβ respetively, as (ompare with Eqs (13.13) and (14.2) in [14℄)

ln Tb =

(ml ln(sNbl) + (ml − 1)(l ln l − l) − ml ln ml + ml)

(15)

ln Tβ =

Now, if all the βk 's are positive one may replae [14℄ , for large values of l, the logarithm of the

sums in Eqs (11) and (14) by that of their largest terms whih may be obtained from Eqs (15)

by (cid:28)rst subtrating from eah a onstant (denoted − ln Z for the (cid:28)rst of (15) and − ln ρ for

the seond) multiplied by their respetive onditions

l=N
l=1 lml = N and

k=l−1
k=1 knk = (l−1).

P

P

The denotation of these onstants as − ln Z and − ln ρ is as in [14℄ and for the purpose of the

following alulations. We, now, di(cid:27)erentiate the (cid:28)rst of the resulting expressions (related

to ln Tb) with respet to ml and the seond (related to ln Tβ ) with respet to nk and equate

to zero so that the values of ml and nk that maximize ln Tb and ln Tβ respetively are

ml = sNbllle−lZ l, nk = lβkkke−kρk

(16)

Note that, due to the nature of bl and βk (see Eqs (7) and (12)), both Z and ρ has dimension

of inverse s. Substituting for nk in the seond of Eqs (15) and regarding the resulting

expression, in the limit of very large l, as representing the logarithm of the sum in (14) one

obtains, negleting the terms − ln 3 and −2 ln l ompared to l and using the ondition for

Compare with the analogous expressions (14.6)-(14.7) in [14℄ for the N partile system. From

the last two equations one obtains, in analogy to the N partile system [14℄

bl = f (l, β)bl
0,

2 THE INTERNET STATISTICS

17

where f (l, β) is small ompared to l so that it satis(cid:28)es liml→∞

= 0. Now, the ondition

ln f (l,β)
l

l=N
l=1 lml = N may be written, using the (cid:28)rst of Eq (16), as

P

Xl=1

l=N

Xl=1

lml =

Nsll+1e−lblZ l = N

Substituting bl = f (l, β)bl

0 into the last equation, dividing by N , and writing for large l

ll+1 ≈ ll

one obtains

l=N

Xl=1

sf (l, β)(le−1b0Z)l = 1

(18)

Using the last equation we show that when the number of sites l of the l-luster is large

and if these sites are doubly onneted to eah other, in whih ase both bl and βk are, as

remarked, positive due to the even number of their fij then enlarging this kind of onnetivity

even slightly, by adding the same links to them, results in an enormous strengthening of the

overall onnetivity. Thus, dividing both sides of Eq (18) by s we an (cid:28)nd, for example, the

ontribution to its sum of the term that orresponds to l = N . We (cid:28)rst write the logarithm

of this term (denoted by TN ).

ln TN = ln f (N, β) + N ln(Ne−1b0Z)

(19)

The expression Nb0Ze−1

may be written as eǫ

so that if ǫ = 0 then Nb0Ze−1 = 1, and

when ǫ is negative Nb0Ze−1

is smaller than unity and the relevant term N ln(Ne−1b0Z) is

negative. In this ase sine it is the dominant term in Eq (19) ln TN is also negative, whih

implies that TN is smaller than unity and its ontribution to the sum in Eq (18) is small.

We, now, assume for N the value of N = 1015

and take into aount the previously obtained

result of liml→∞

ln f (l,β)
l

= 0, whih requires that ln f (N, β) be muh smaller than N . Thus,

if ǫ inreases from zero by only the small amount of 10−10

, due to adding a small quantity

of linked sites to the luster, the value of ln TN grows, as a result of this, by 105
the ontribution of TN to the sum inreases by 10105

. That is, adding even a very small

so that

2 THE INTERNET STATISTICS

18

amount of onneting links to a large luster of onneted sites results in an unproportional

large amount of additional "material" to this spei(cid:28) large luster and to a orresponding

strengthening of the overall onnetivity. Now, remembering that Eq (19) was obtained after

dividing both sides of Eq (18) by s we have to onlude in order to retain Eq (18) that s

must dereases in this ase to a orrespondingly very small value, where, as noted, s is the

"volume" in s spae per site. We note that the analogous disussion in [14℄ for the N partile

system also yields similar results (see p. 300 and Figure 14.1 in [14℄). That is, in order to

keep the relevant equations for the last ase onsistent one have to onlude that the volume

for one partile v in the on(cid:28)guration spae must beomes in(cid:28)nitesimally small.

In that

ase the relevant large onneted luster of partiles undergones a phase transition termed

ondensation in [14℄. That is, the former distanes among these partiles beome very small

and they tend now to onentrate in a small region of spae. We, now, reall that in our

ase the omponents of the relevant linked luster (the Internet websites) are related to eah

other by the variable s that denotes the (cid:16)distane(cid:17) between them, that is, how muh they

are similar to eah other (see the disussion before Eq (1)). Thus, the meaning of what we

have said that for the large luster of doubly linked sites the volume in s spae for one site

beomes very small is that the distanes that signify the di(cid:27)erenes between them beome

also very small and they all turn out to be similar to eah other. This ours, as remarked,

when adding a small amount of links to the larger terms of the sum in Eq (18) whih results

in the outome that the overall onnetivity among the omponent sites beomes maximal

in the sense that they have the same links and so they are similar to eah other.

Note that all the former disussion depends on the assumption that all the βk are positive

(see the paragraph after Eq (15)) whereas we know that the signs of bl and βk alternate due

to the evennes and oddness of their number of fij (see the disussion after Eq (12)). But if

we on(cid:28)ne our disussion to only the double onneted sites then all the bl and βk are, as

remarked, positive (in addition to their being mutually onneted as required) so the former

disussion and Eqs (15)-(19) are obviously valid. That is, the double onneted lusters

may show this kind of phase transition-like of the onnetivity by only adding a very small

amount of onneting links. Note that the mathematial expressions of the doubly onneted

N site system are the same as the N partile system disussed in [14℄ exept that in the

websites system all the bld and βkd are positive, and this kind of avalanhe (or ondensation

as termed in [14℄) has been shown in [14℄ for the N partile system provided one assumes

that all the βk are positive.

We note that the proess just desribed of a large inrease in the fration of the onne-

tivity in linked large-size lusters is frequently enountered in ensembles of shared omputers

onneted to eah other and to the Internet. In this ase an additional web site in the form

of a (cid:28)le that has been programmed intentionally for the purpose of adding and onneting

it to the other (cid:28)les of the shared ensemble enhanes the onnetivity of these members to

a very high degree. For example, suppose that all these members use some utility program

and that not all of them have the same version of it but use several ones, so that adding an

updation (cid:28)le of this program to them turns all the di(cid:27)erent versions into one that is ommon

to all thereby inreasing very muh the total onnetivity of them.

3 Conluding Remarks

We have disussed the Internet statistis using a generalized version of the Ursell-Mayer

statistial mehanis [13, 14, 15℄. We (cid:28)nd it appropriate to disuss the relevant omponents

of the Internet statistis, whih are the websites, by introduing a new variable that takes

aount of the unique nature of them. The speial harater of the Internet, unlike any

other fratal web, is espeially demonstrated through the links in its websites whih may be

of several kinds as disussed after Eq (1). Taking into aount this unique harater and

introduing the relevant expressions into the Ursell-Mayer framework we have shown that one

may obtain a phase-transition phenomena. This ours when a large luster of doubly linked

sites are added an extra small amount of onneting links in whih ase the ontribution of

this luster to the overall onnetivity of the entire ensemble beomes enormous. This has

been learly demonstrated using a generalized version of the Ursell-Mayer's formalism.

We investigate the average frequency of positive slope ν +

α , crossing for the returns of market prices. The
method is based on stochastic processes which no scaling feature is explicitly required. Using this method we
deﬁne new quantity to quantify stage of development and activity of stocks exchange. We compare the Tehran
and western stock markets and show that some stocks such as Tehran (TEPIX) and New zealand (NZX) stocks
exchange are emerge, and also TEPIX is a non-active market and ﬁnancially motivated to absorb capital.

INTRODUCTION

II. LEVEL CROSSING ANALYSIS

In recent years, ﬁnancial markets have been at the focus of
physicists’s attempts to apply existing knowledge from sta-
tistical mechanics to economic problems1,2,3,4. These mar-
kets, though largely varying in details of trading rules and
traded goods, are characterized by some generic features of
their ﬁnancial time series. Here we introduce a new method
to analyze these time series are calling is as ”level-crossing
method”. The method is based on stochastic processes which
should grasp the scale dependency of any time series in a most
general way. No scaling feature is explicitly required. This
stochastic approach has turned out to be a promising tool also
for other systems with scale dependent complexity ( see5 and6
about the application of the method to characterize the rough-
ness of growing surfaces). Some authors have applied this
method to study the ﬂuctuations of velocity ﬁelds in Burg-
ers turbulence7 and the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation in d +
1-dimensions8.

The level crossing analysis is very sensitive to correlation
when the time series is shufﬂed and to probability density
functions (PDF) with fat tails when the time series is surro-
gated. The aim is to characterize the statistical properties of
given time series with the hope that a better understanding of
the underlying stochastic dynamics could provide useful in-
formation to create new models able to reproduce experimen-
tal facts. An important aspect concerns are ability to deﬁne
concepts of activity and degree of development of the markets.
Based on recent research for characterizing the stage of de-
velopment of markets9,10, it is shown that the Hurst exponent
shows remarkable differences between developed and emerg-
ing markets. Level crossing with detecting correlation is a
useful tool to ﬁnd the stage of development of markets, too. It
is known that emerging markets have long-range correlation.
This sensitivity of level crossing to the market conditions pro-
vides a new and simple way of empirically characterizing the
development of ﬁnancial markets.

This paper is organized as follows. In section II we discuss
the level crossing method in detail. Data description and data
analysis based on the level crossing method of some stocks
indices are given in section III. Section IV closes with a dis-
cussion of the present results.

Let us consider a time series of price index with length n
given by p(t1), p(t2), ..., p(tn), and the price returns rt which
is deﬁned as r(ti) = ln p(ti + 1) − ln p(ti). Let ν+
α denote
the number of positive difference crossing of r(t) − ¯r = α
for interval T (see ﬁgure 1) and let the mean value for all the
samples be N +

α (L) where

N +

α (T ) = E[n+

α (T )].

Since the process r(ti), is a stationary ( the averaged vari-
ance saturate to a certain value) if we take a second interval
of T immediately following the ﬁrst we shall obtain the same
result, and for the two intervals together we shall therefore
obtain

N +

α (2T ) = 2N +

α (T ),

from which it follows that, for a stationary process, the aver-
age number of crossing is proportional to the space interval T .
Hence

or

N +

α (T ) ∝ T,

N +

α (T ) = ν+

α T.

which ν+
α is the average frequency of positive slope crossing
of the level r(t)− ¯r = α. We now consider how the frequency
parameter ν+
α can be deduced from the underlying probability
distribution function PDF for r(t) − ¯r. In time interval △t the
sample can only cross r(t) − ¯r = α with positive difference
if it has the property r(t) − ¯r < α at the beginning of the
time interval. Furthermore there is a minimum difference at
time t if the level r(t) − ¯r = α is to be crossed in interval △t
depending on the value of r(t) − ¯r at time t. So there will be
a positive crossing of r(t) − ¯r = α in the next time interval
△t if, at time t,

r(t) − ¯r < α

and

III. APPLICATION ON STOCK MARKET

We have analyzed the level crossing of return time series for
S&P500, Djindu, Biojen, 10ytsy, Composite, Amex, TEPIX
and NZX. To have a good comparison, we have chosen the
time series from the same time interval: 20 May 1994 to 18
March 2004. The data have been recorded at each trading day.
Consider a price time series with length n. Then transform
the time series into a zero mean returns with unit variance and
length m = n − 1 such that r1(i) = ln( pi+1
pi ), i = 1..., n − 1.
According to Eq. 6 the level crossing, ν+
α , is calculated for
each index. Figure 2 shows a comparison of ν+
α for TEPIX
It is clear that ν+
and S&P500 as a function of level α.
α
scales inversely with time, so τ (α) = 1
is a time inter-
ν+
α
val, within this time, the level crossing in average will be ob-
served again. Table I shows the time interval in the high fre-
quency (τ (α = 0)) and the low frequency (tails, τ (α = ±3σ))
regimes for some indices. The time interval τ (α = 0) of
TEPIX and S&P500 are 7.0 and 4.0 days, respectively. Still,
in the tails, it is comparable. Another difference between
TEPIX and the other markets (except Amex market) is seen in
the time interval of left and right tails. The time length in the
left tail is larger than the time length in the right but also less
than the other markets. This means that TEPIX is ﬁnancially
motivated to absorb capital. It is clear that when we apply Eq.
7 to the small q regime, high frequency is more signiﬁcant,
whereas in the large q regime, low frequency (the tail) is more
signiﬁcant. Figure 3 shows that when q < 2, the value of N +
tot
for TEPIX is smaller than that of S&P500, while for q > 2,
the value of N +
tot for TEPIX gets larger than the other mar-
kets. This is because for small q the low frequency events of
tails are more signiﬁcant than the high frequency peak. Ac-
cording to the last section and Eq. 7, the area under the level
crossing curve, N +
tot(q = 0), shows the total number of cross-
ing. This means that the larger the area, the larger the activity.
In essence, by comparing the N +
tot(q = 0), the activity of the
index is obtained.

From another point of view, based on recent research of
characterizing the stage of development of markets9,10, it is
shown that the Hurts exponent is sensitive to the degree of
development of the market. Emerging markets are associated
with high value of Hurts exponent and developed markets are
associated with low value of the exponent. In particular, it
is found that all the emerging markets have Hurts exponents
larger than 0.5 (strongly correlated) whereas all the developed
markets have Hurts exponents near to or less than 0.5 (white
noise or anti-correlated). Here we have shown that the level
crossing has ability to characterize the degree of development
of the markets. The sensitivity of the level crossing to the mar-
ket conditions provides a new and more simple way of empir-
ically characterizing the activity and development of ﬁnancial
markets. Since N +
tot(q = 0) is very sensitive to correlation,
it increases when the time series is shufﬂed so that the cor-
relation disappears. Thus, by comparing the change between
N +
sh(q = 0) (shufﬂed), the stage of devel-
opment of markets can be determined. Figure 4 shows ν+
α as
a function of α for original and shufﬂed data in TEPIX and

tot(q = 0) for orig-
inal data and its shufﬂed and Hurst exponent are reported in
Table II. We notice that TEPIX and NZX belong to the emerg-
ing markets category; it is far from an efﬁcient and developed
market. These result are comparable with the results reported
in9 and show that Tehran stock exchange belongs to the cate-
gory of emerging ﬁnancial markets.

IV. CONCLUSION

In this paper the concept of level crossing analysis has been
applied to several stock market indices. It is shown that the
level crossing is able to detect the activity of markets. This
method is based on stochastic processes which should grasp
the scale dependency of any time series in a most general
way. No scaling feature is explicitly required. Based on re-

markets9,10, it is shown that the level crossing is sensitive
to the degree of development of market, too. This sensitiv-
ity of the level crossing to the market conditions provides a
new and simple way of empirically characterizing the activ-
ity and development of ﬁnancial markets. Considering all of
the above discussions and results, we notice that the Tehran
Stock Exchange belongs to the emerging markets category. It
is far from an efﬁcient and developed market and also we have
found that it is ﬁnancially motivated to absorb capital. Using
this method we classify the activity and stage of development
of some markets.

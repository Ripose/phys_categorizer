Abstract

We study the eﬀect on the distribution of return periods of rare events of the presence in
a time series of ﬁnite-term correlations with non-exponential decay. Precisely, we analyze the
auto-correlation function and the statistics of the return intervals of extreme values of the
resistance ﬂuctuations displayed by a resistor with granular structure in a nonequilibrium
stationary state. The resistance ﬂuctuations, δR, are calculated by Monte Carlo simulations
using the SBRN model introduced some years ago by Pennetta, Tref´an and Reggiani and
based on a resistor network approach. A rare event occurs when δR overcomes a threshold
value q signiﬁcantly higher than the average value of the resistance. We have found that for
highly disordered networks, when the auto-correlation function displays a non-exponential
decay but yet the resistance ﬂuctuations are characterized by a ﬁnite correlation time, the
distribution of return intervals of the extreme values is well described by a stretched expo-
nential, with exponent largely independent of the threshold q. We discuss this result and
some of the main open questions related to it, also in connection with very recent ﬁndings
by other authors concerning the observation of stretched exponential distributions of return
intervals of extreme events in long-term correlated time series.

1 Introduction

It is well known that in a Poisson process the return periods between extreme events associated
with the exceedance of a threshold are exponentially distributed [1, 2]. In other terms, by con-
sidering a time series x(t) made by uncorrelated records, the return periods rq of events above a
threshold q (i.e. the time intervals between two consecutive occurences of the condition x(t) > q)
are distributed according to the probability density function (PDF):

Pq(r) = (1/Rq) exp(−r/Rq)

(1)

where Rq is the mean return interval of these events [1, 2]. Of course, the higher the value of q
(quantile), the rarer are the events over-threshold and bigger is the value of Rq. Fluctuations of
prices in ﬁnancial markets, wind speed data or daily precipitations in a given location for a same
time windows are typically described by uncorrelated records [1, 3]. However, particularly in the
last ten years, it has become clear that several other important examples of time series display

long-term correlations [3, 4, 5]. This is the case of physiological data, like heartbeats [6, 7] and
neuron spikes [8], hydro-meteorological records, like daily temperatures [3, 4, 9], geophysical or
astrophysical data, concerning for example the occurrence of earthquakes [10, 11] or solar ﬂares
[12], stock market volatility [3, 13] and internet traﬃc records [4]. Long-term correlated series
are characterized by an auto-correlation function which decays as a power-law:

Cx(s) =< xixi+s >=

xixi+s ∼ s−γx

,

0 < γx < 1

N − s

i=1

In this case, since the mean correlation time τ is the integral of Cx(s) over s, it is easy to see that
this time diverges when the correlation exponent γx is between 0 and 1.

Recently, Bunde et al.

[4] investigated the eﬀect of long-terms correlations on the statistics
of the return periods of extreme events rq. These authors found that: i) long-terms correlations
leave unchanged the mean return interval Rq; ii) they signiﬁcantly modiﬁes the distribution of
return intervals whose PDF becomes a stretched exponential:

Pq(r) = a exp[−(b r/Rq)γ]

(3)

where the values of the exponents γ and γx are found the same; and that iii) the return intervals
themself are long-term correlated, with an exponent γ′ close to the exponent γ of the original
records [4]. The result i) was obtained by Bunde et al. [4] by statistical arguments and, as clariﬁed
by Altmann and Kantz in a very recent paper [3], it can identiﬁed be with Kac’s lemma [14] in the
context of area preserving dynamical systems. The results ii) and iii) in Ref. [4] were obtained by
numerical analysis of long-term correlated Gaussian time series generated by the Fourier transform
technique and by imposing a power-law decay of the power spectrum [15]. Very recently, it has
been realized [3, 5] that result ii) only applies to linear time series (i.e. to series whose properties
are completely deﬁned by the power spectrum and by the probability distribution, regardless of
the Fourier phases). However, a part from this restriction, the stretched exponential distribution
of the return intervals of extreme events seems to be a general feature in presence of long-term
correlations in a time series [3, 5]. It must be noted that this feature has important consequences
on the observation of extreme events: in fact it implies a strong enhancement of the probability
of having return periods well below Rq and well above Rq, in comparison with the occurrence of
extreme events in an uncorrelated time series. Finally, it must be underlined that the distribution
in Eq. (3) is a single parameter function, being a and b in Eq. (3) functions only of the exponent γ,
as shown in Ref. [3]. Here, we study the eﬀect on the distribution of return periods of rare events
of the presence in a time series of ﬁnite-term correlations with non-exponential decay. Precisely, in
the following section we will analyze the auto-correlation function and the statistics of the return
intervals of extreme values of the resistance ﬂuctuations displayed by a resistor with granular
structure in a nonequilibrium stationary state [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. In particular we will consider
time series characterized by a stretched exponential decay of the auto-correlation function, thus
a behavior intermediate between an exponential and a power law decay. A situation which can
occur in systems which are approaching criticality [2, 21].

2 Method and Results

We analyze time series of resistance ﬂuctuations of a thin resistor with granular structure in
nonequilibrium stationary states in contact with a thermal bath at temperature T0 and biased
by an external current I. More precisely, we indicate with R the resistance of the resistor, with

Figure 1: The x(t) signal (resistance ﬂuctuations calculated by the SBRN model) as a function
of the time expressed in simulation time steps. Only a small portion of the records are shown.
The data have been normalized to provide a zero average and a unit variance for x(t).

< R > its average value and with σ the root-mean-square deviation from the average and we
analyze the normalized signal: x(t) ≡ (R(t)− < R >)/σ, with zero average and unit variance.
The R(t) series is calculated by using the stationary and biased resistor network (SBRN) model
introduced in 1999 by Pennetta, Tref´an and Reggiani [22] and developed in Refs. [16, 17, 18, 19].
This model describes a thin ﬁlm with granular structure as a resistor network in a stationary state
determined by the competition between two stochastic processes, breaking and recovery of the
elementary resistors. Both processes are thermally activated and biased by the external current.
The network resistance and its ﬂuctuations are calculated by Monte Carlo simulations. All the
details about the model and its results are reported in Refs.
[16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. Within this
model, the level of intrinsic disorder in the network (average fraction of broken resistors in the
vanishing current limit [23]) is controlled by a characteristic parameter: λ ≡ (ED − ER)/kBT0,
where ED and ER are the activation energies respectively of the breaking and recovery processes.
It holds the relationship: λmin < λ < λmax, where λmax corresponds to an homogeneous resistor
(perfect network) and λ = λmin ≈ 0 to the maximum level of intrinsic disorder compatible with a
stationary state of the network (stationary resistance ﬂuctuations) [17, 18, 19, 20, 23]. In addition
to this intrinsic disorder, a disorder biased by the current I is also present in the network. As
a consequence, for a given value of λ, and for a network of given size, nonequilibrium stationary
states of the resistor exist only for I ≤ IB (breakdown threshold). When I > IB the resistor
undergoes an electrical breakdown, associated with an irreversible divergence of its resistance
[16, 17, 18, 20]. For a generic value of λ this breakdown corresponds to a ﬁrst order transition
[17, 18, 19]. However, for decreasing λ values, when λ → λmin, the system becomes more and more
close to its critical point [17, 18, 19]. We note that the SBRN model provides a good description of
many features associated with nonequilibrium stationary states and with the electrical instability
of composite and granular materials [16, 17, 18], including the electromigration damage of metallic
lines [20].

Long x(t) time series (typically made of 1 ÷ 2 × 106 records) have been generated and analyzed

for diﬀerent values of λ, of the external current and of the network size. The analysis has been
performed by calculating the auto-correlation function Cx and the PDF of the x records, the
return intervals rq of the extreme values for diﬀerent threshold q and their distribution Pq(r).
The values of q are expressed in root-mean-square deviation units. At small λ values (high level
of intrinsic disorder), we have found that the auto-correlation function displays a non-exponential
(but non-power-law) decay. This behavior is diﬀerent from that displayed at high λ values (low
level of intrinsic disorder), where Cx exhibits an exponential decay (consistent with the Lorentzian
power spectrum reported in previous works [16, 17, 19]). Here we will focus on this situation,
which is typical of a system which is approaching criticality, and we will show the results obtained
by taking λ = 0.33 for a network of size 125 × 125, biased by a current I = 0.011 A.

Figure 1 displays a portion of the x(t) time series (the total number of records in x(t) is
1.6 × 106). The ﬁgure clearly shows a strong non-Gaussianity of the resistance ﬂuctuations. Ac-
tually, with the above speciﬁed choice of the parameters, the PDF of the resistance ﬂuctuations is
well described by the Bramwell-Holdworth-Pinton [24] distribution, as discussed in Refs. [18, 19].
Figure 2 reports the auto-correlation function which signiﬁcantly deviates from a single exponen-
tial or a power-law behavior. We have found that Cx is well ﬁtted by a stretched exponential
function: Cx(s) = A exp[(−s/b)γ )], with the following values of the ﬁtting parameters: A = 1.23,
b = 74.9 and γ = 0.54. We have also considered many other functions for the best-ﬁt of the Cx
data. However, we have found that the stretched exponential function optimizes the best-ﬁt pro-
cedure with the minimum numbers of ﬁtting parameters. We note that this expression of Cx(s)
recovers the simple exponential dependence for γ = 1 while it provides a constant behavior for
γ = 0. Moreover, it provides a ﬁnite value of the average correlation time τ . Figure 3 shows the
return intervals of the extreme values above the threshold q = 5. For comparison, in Fig. 4 we
have reported the return intervals obtained for the same quantile by random shuﬄing the records
of x(t) (an operation which leaves unchanged the PDF of the x-data). The diﬀerent scales of Fig.
3 and 4 must be underlined. Similarly to the results of Bunde et al.
[5] concerning long-term
correlated records, Fig. 3 shows a strong clustering of the extreme events: sequences of very short
return intervals follow sequences of typically long intervals. This strong clustering is present even

if the x records are not long-term correlated while they are characterized by a ﬁnite correlation
time. A situation completely diﬀerent from that reported in Fig. 4, which corresponds to fully
uncorrelated records. The clustering of extreme values persists also by lowering the threshold.
This is displayed in Fig. 5 which shows the return intervals obtained for q = 2.5. Again, Fig. 6
reports the returns intervals calculated by shuﬄing the x-data.

The probability density function Pq(r) of the return intervals of extreme values is plotted
in Fig. 7 in a double-logarithmic scale as a function of r/Rq and for diﬀerent quantiles q (the
probability density has been normalized to Pq(1)). This representation has been adopted for
convenience: in fact in this plot a stretched exponential function with exponent γ is represented
by a straight line, whose slope just provides the value of γ. For check and comparison we have
reported in Fig. 8 the probability density function Pq(r) of the return intervals calculated after
random shuﬄing the x-records: in this case γ = 1, i.e. the distribution of the rq is exponential,
as it must be for a Poisson process. Thus, Fig. 7 shows that the distribution of return intervals
of extreme values of x(t) is well described by a stretched exponential and that the value of the
exponent γ is independent of the threshold q in a large range of q-values. Moreover, at least in
the case of the data reported in Figs. 1-8, the value of the exponent γ of the return interval
distribution is just 1/2 of the value of γx, the exponent of the auto-correlation function. An
analysis performed on other sets of data, obtained for high disordered networks of diﬀerent size L
and/or biased by diﬀerent current density I/L, seems to conﬁrm this last result. However, further
investigations are necessary to establish the possible relationship between the two exponents.

3 Conclusions and Open Questions

We have studied the distribution of return intervals of extreme events in time series with ﬁnite-
term correlations. Precisely, we have analyzed the auto-correlation function and the distribution
of the return intervals of extreme values of the resistance ﬂuctuations displayed by a resistor
with granular structure in nonequilibrium stationary states. The resistance ﬂuctuations were
calculated by Monte Carlo simulations using the SBRN model [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. We have found
that for highly disordered networks, when the auto-correlation function displays a non-exponential
(precisely, a stretched exponential) decay and the resistance ﬂuctuations are characterized by a
ﬁnite correlation time, the distribution of return intervals of the extreme values is well described
by a stretched exponential with exponent γ largely independent of the threshold q. Therefore our
results show that the stretched exponential distribution [21] describes the distribution of return
intervals of extreme events not only in the case of long-term correlated time series [3, 4, 5] but
also when the records are characterized by ﬁnite-term correlations, with non-exponential decay of
the auto-correlation function. Many open questions arise from this study and we limit to mention
the following ones:
i) why is the distribution of return intervals of extreme values a stretched
exponential? what is the basic reason for this behavior which, as we have found, is not only
limited to long-term correlated records [3, 4, 5] but is present also when non-exponential, ﬁnite
term correlations are present? ii) what is the relationship between the exponents γ and γx? The
correlations among the rq have been studied in Refs. [3, 4, 5] in the case of long-term correlated
processes, thus we can ask iii) what kind of correlations exist among the rq in the case of a
ﬁnite-term, non-exponentially correlated processes ?

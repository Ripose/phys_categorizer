(Dated: February 2, 2008)

The problem of determining dynamical models and trajectories that describe ob-
served time-series data (dynamical inference) allowing for the understanding, predic-
tion and possibly control of complex systems in nature is one of very great interest
in a wide variety of ﬁelds. Often, however, in multidimensional systems only part of
the system’s dynamical variables can be measured. Furthermore, the measurements
are usually corrupted by noise and the dynamics is complicated by an interplay of
nonlinearity and random perturbations. The problem of dynamical inference in these
general settings is challenging researchers for decades. We solve this problem by ap-
plying a path-integral approach to ﬂuctuational dynamics [1, 2, 3, 4], and show that,
given the measurements, the system trajectory can be obtained from the solution
of the certain auxiliary Hamiltonian problem in which measured data act eﬀectively
as a control force driving the estimated trajectory toward the most probable that
provides a minimum to certain mechanical action. The dependance of the mini-
mum action on the model parameters determines the statistical distribution in the
model space consistent with the measurements. We illustrate the eﬃciency of the
approach by solving an intensively studied problem from the population dynamics
of predator-prey system [5] where the prey populations may be observed while the
predator populations or even their number is diﬃcult or impossible to estimate. We
emphasize that the predator-prey dynamics is fully nonlinear, perturbed stochas-
tically by environmental factors and is not known beforehand (see e.g. [6]). No
overall solution was previously available for this problem even in the deterministic
case [7, 8]. We apply our approach to recover both the unknown dynamics of preda-
tors and model parameters (including parameters that are traditionally very diﬃcult
to estimate) directly from measurements of the prey dynamics. We provide a com-
parison of our method with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique. As a further
test of the method we demonstrate the reconstruction of the dynamics of chaotic
Lorenz attractor driven by noise from measurements of only one if its trajectory
component.

INTRODUCTION

2

For quantitative understanding, predicting, and controlling time-varying phenomena

it is necessary to relate observations to a mathematical model of a system dynamics.

In a great number of important problems such model is multidimensional, nonlinear,

stochastic and not known from “ﬁrst principles”. Furthermore, often only part of the

system’s variables can be measured and these measurements are corrupted by noise. The

rest of the system variables are invisible, or hidden. In these settings, perhaps the most

fundamentally diﬃcult unsolved problem of dynamical inference is how and to which

extent one can learn both the model parameters and system trajectory from a given set of

incomplete trajectory measurements. A solution of this problem is of importance across

many disciplines. Examples range from molecular motors [10] to coupled matter-radiation

system [11] (see e.g.

[7, 8, 12, 13] for further examples).

Here we present a solution to this problem using a path-integral approach to ﬂuctu-

ational dynamics[1]. We show that, given the measurements, the most probable system

trajectory can be obtained from ﬁnding the minimum of the mechanical action of a certain

auxiliary Hamiltonian system under properly deﬁned boundary conditions. The depen-

dence of the minimum action on the system model parameters determines the statistical

likelihood of diﬀerent parametric models.

The method is used to solve an intensively studied problem from the population dy-

namics of the predator-prey system[5, 13, 14] where the cyclic dynamics of populations of

small rodents is observed in Kilpisj¨arvi, Finnish Lapland, 1952-1992 [15] (see Fig. 1(a))

while the number of predators is diﬃcult or impossible to estimate. The predator-prey

dynamics is fully nonlinear subject to seasonal and random perturbations. This is a clas-

sical longstanding problem in ecology [16] and epidemiology (see e.g. [17]). In particular,

the cited database accumulates nearly 5000 individual datasets with similar structure

collected over more then 150 years of research. It is shown that the proposed approach

allows to recover both the unknown dynamics of predators and model parameters directly

from measurements of the prey dynamics.

To formalize the discussion above note that in a typical experimental situation we

observe M-dimensional time series of signals

the system x(t). We are interested in the case where M

components are hidden. Quantitative understanding of the time-varying phenomena un-

derlying

requires, in general, an expert input into the observed data in the form of

Y

a mathematical modelling framework for the system dynamics and for the measurement

scheme. A commonly used dynamical and measurement equations for nonlinear models

in the presence of random perturbations that apply to but by far not limited by the

predator-prey ecological system described above are

Due to the presence of dynamical and measurement noise the problem of dynamical in-

ference must be cast in probabilistic terms. This can be done within a general framework

of the Baeysian statistical approach [18, 19]. A key statistical quantity is a so-called likeli-

hood probability density functional (LPDF)

Y [x(t);

]. It represents a joint probability

density that the system trajectory is x(t) and the system parameter values are

. We emphasize that in a real physical process

conditioned on the observed time-series

Y

the system has a distinct trajectory and parameter values. In this regard the LPDF rep-

resents a degree of uncertainty in our knowledge about these quantities obtained from the

measurements and assuming some basic properties of the system ﬂuctuational dynamics

[24].

The explicit

form of the LPDF can be obtained from (1) using the path-

integral approach to ﬂuctuational dynamics

[1, 2, 4]. We write

on the case M < L that implies the existence of hidden variables. We note that despite

hidden dynamical variables are not measured directly the functional SY (3) still depends

on them explicitly because of the dynamic coupling between the variables imposed by the

force ﬁeld K.

In many practically important cases available recording of a system trajectory, while

containing only a part of dynamical variables, has suﬃciently small time-step, long time

duration and limited noise characteristics. Such measurements can provide a strong in-

formation that is suﬃcient to pin down both key model parameters of the system and

its trajectory, or at least to extract strong correlations between them. In these cases the

We now put forth a new paradigm in which a solution of the dynamical inference

problem with hidden variables is obtained via the calculus of variations for the functional

SY (x(t),

The Bayesian approach for dynamical inference was initially proposed by Meyer and

Christensenin [19] for the case where all variables were directly observed. The previous

7

work on this subject (see e.g. [6, 19, 20, 21]) was exclusively focusing on brute force

numerical methods, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). However our detailed

study of MCMC approach for the problem of dynamical inference with hidden variables

has shown that the functional SY (x(t),

) has multiple deep spurious minima in the space

of piece-wise continuous trajectories

. These minima occur due to the

search stacks in those minima and takes a prohibitively large time to converge (see Sec. V

for details). In contrary, our approach avoids those spurious minima because the solution

of the Hamiltonian boundary value problem (6) is achieved via large smooth variations in

the space of continuous trajectories. This key ﬁnding reﬂects a basic property of a hidden-

variable and parameter inference in a noisy dynamical system with continuous vector ﬁeld

K(x, C): expected value of the inferred trajectory xopt(t) is a smoothly varying function

of time whereas the measured signal y(t) is not.

We note that the likelihood distribution around the maximum is determined by the

second variation δ2SY of the action with respect to the both x(t) and

computed at

M

its minimum. In many cases, in particular in the case of a multi-modal LPDF, it is of

interested to explicitly study the full shape of the LPDF in a reduced subspace of the

model parameters while marginalizing the LPDF with respect to the other parameters

and the system trajectory. Within our approach this can be handily done by computing

the minimum action Sopt(c1, c2) using the above algorithm for diﬀerent values of the

parameters (c1, c2).

However in many complex cases where observational and model errors are signiﬁcant

and hidden variables are present LPDF can have a very large number of local minima. In

this case the more informative quantity is a distribution of local minima. To obtain it we
pick at random some values of (c1, c2) and converge to the nearest point (c′
minimum of the action Sopt(c1, c2) where the conditions δS

2) of a local
δM = 0 are satisﬁed.
We then repeat this procedure many times for diﬀerent starting values of (c1.c2). Then

δx(t) = 0 and δS

the histogram of the local minima (c′

appropriately normalized gives the distribution of local minima P = PY (c1, c2). We will

demonstrate this approach in Sec. III for the inference of the population dynamics.

Finally, we emphasize that the prerequisite of the approach considered in this section

is that LPDF computed at any set

of relevant parameter values has a sharp peak in

M

the space of the system paths x(t) at some xopt(t) that depends on

(cf. Fig. 5).

INFERENCE OF PREDATOR-PREY MODEL.

We now apply the method described above to reconstruction of the unknown predator

dynamics and model parameters from the observed oscillations of small rodents in Finish

Lapland. The observed time-series data is shown by yellow circles in the Fig. 1(a). To

formulate the problem we ﬁrst brieﬂy summarize an expert input into observed data, see

e.g.

[5, 13, 14, 26] for more details. It was argued [5, 13] that the most likely predators

to potentially maintain oscillatory dynamics in rodent populations are small mustelids,

weasels, and stoats which are notoriously diﬃcult to observe and study in the ﬁeld. It

was further argued [5, 13, 26] that in addition to the dominating eﬀect of these so-called

specialist predators the population of rodents is strongly aﬀected by generalists predators

(such as foxes, owls and skua) and by seasonal (periodic) and stochastic variations of the

environment. Based on these arguments the following equations were introduced to model

observed ecological time series

{

}

The precise functional form is known neither for predation nor for numerical response

of the predators and some modiﬁcations of the equations (7) where considered in the

10

literature [14].

The problem of dynamical inference is the following: Use 80 experimental points of

corrupted by noise measurements to recover both hidden dynamics of predators P = P (t)

and the model of the nonlinear stochastic dynamics of small rodent in Fennoscandia

represented by the full set of parameters from Eq. (7) and σosb. Since there were no general

methods to recover neither hidden dynamics nor nonlinear models of stochastic systems

it was always assumed (see e.g. [5, 14]) that the goal to obtain solution of this problem is

unrealistic and no attempt was made to solve it in the earlier research. Instead a number

of models were developed [5, 13, 14, 26] from the ﬁrst ecological principles and from the

extensive ﬁeld studies of the small rodents ecology. The outcome of the simulation of these

models was compared to the experimental points to decide whether or not the model is

capable of producing reasonable predictions. This approach although very valuable and

often the only one available in practice has very limited statistical signiﬁcance and can

hardly be generalized.

The method introduced above provides a general and eﬀective alternative approach to

a solution of this ecological problem. First, we map the predator-pray model (7) directly

onto the dynamical model with additive white noise considered in Eqs. (1) by making the
change of variables: x1(t) = log(N(t)/K ′) and x2(t) = log(Q′P/K ′) (here some known
nominal values are used for the scaling coeﬃcients K ′ and Q′). Then the full set of

unknown parameters c =

r, s, e1, e2, K, G, C, Q, H, D, σn, σp, σobs}

{

and the trajectory of

the predator density P = P (t) is inferred from the observed data using the dynamical

inference scheme described above (for the scaling of dynamical equations and precise

ecological meaning of these parameters see [5, 13, 26]). To present the solution of this

inference problem we investigate the marginalized LPDF as a function of key model

parameters that are notoriously diﬃcult to estimate [13] using other techniques: carrying

capacity K and equilibrium ration between two populations Q (see online supplement

material for further details).

The results are shown in the Fig 1 and Fig. 3. It can be seen from the Fig 1 (a) that the

r and rK ′/K. This gives rise to a broad distribution of the possible dynamical trajectories

of hidden predators shown in the Fig 1 (b). However, the likelihood functions of various

trajectories are exponentially diﬀerent. This fact is taken into account by weighting the

corresponding distributions of the model parameters with the factor exp(

SY [x(t), c]).

The weighted distributions of trajectories and model parameters is the main outcome of

IV. LEMMING OSCILLATIONS IN THE HIGH-ARCTIC TUNDRA IN

GREENLAND

The method can be further veriﬁed by analyzing experimental data obtained for the

small rodents-predators community in high-arctic Greenland [26]. This data is very similar

to the data collected in Fennoscandia with a important exception, namely, dynamics of

both populations prey and predator was recorded very carefully in Greenland. Therefore,

it has become possible to check if the predator dynamics reconstructed from the prey

population alone coincides with the actual observations of the predator time series. The

experimental data (see Fig. 3) for the population oscillation in the lemming-stoat predator

prey community were collected in the high-Arctic tundra in Greenland in 1988–2002 [26].

The time-variation of the predator and prey oscillations are also inﬂuenced by a number

of generalists predators such as arctic fox, snowy owl, and long-tailed skua. We note

that a very detailed model with experimentally measured numerical responses of various

predators is available [26] to simulate this data. However, to analyze hidden predator

population along the lines outlined in the previous section we notice that the organization

of the lemming-stoat community in the high-arctic Greenland is very similar to the vole-

weasel community in Finnish Lapland. So we attempt to ﬁt the lemming-stoat population

oscillations using the model (7) developed for the latter community [5, 13, 14].
In this model the populations are scaled as x = log(N/K ′) and y = log( Q′P

K ′ ) with some
assumed values of the carrying capacity K ′ and proportionality constant Q′ (K ′ and Q′

values in the range: 4 - 7 yr−1; (ii) the dimensionless amplitude of seasonal forcing e
with range: 0.5 - 1; (iii) prey carrying capacity K with range: 100 - 300 voles ha−1.

The specialist predator population is described by: (i) intrinsic rate of weasel population
growth s with range: 1- 1.5 yr−1; (ii) minimum consumption per predator C with range:
500-700 voles yr−1 weasel−1; (iii) half saturation constant D with range: 5-6 voles ha−1;
(iv) predator-prey constant ratio Q with range: 20-40 voles weasel−1. The generalist

predation is characterized by: (i) the maximum rate of mortality G with range: 70 - 125
voles ha−1 yr−1 and (ii) half-saturation prey density H with range: 11-16 voles ha−1.

First, we try to ﬁt this model to the experimental data taking into account measure-

ments of both populations. To avoid the problem related to the fact that continuous

model is being ﬁtted to the experimental points measured only once a year we interpolate

experimental points for predator and prey using a piecewise cubic Hermite interpolation

with time step h = 0.001 year. The corresponding results of the ﬁt are shown by the

dashed black line in the Fig. 4(a) and (b). We note that the model (8) can ﬁt very well

experimental data. However, this agreement has a limited statistical signiﬁcance since we

are ﬁtting 30 experimental points by a nonlinear model with 18 parameters. It turns out

that the same experimental data can be well ﬁt in a broad range of the values of the model

parameters. A detailed study of the landscape of the log-likelihood function is needed

to choose the most probable model. We defer this study to a future publication. In the

present study our main goal is to verify that even in the absence of the measurements of

the predator population we can still recover both hidden dynamics of the predator and

the model parameters although with degraded accuracy.

To this end we now infer both hidden dynamics of the stoat population and the model

parameters assuming that only population of lemming was measured. The corresponding

inference results are shown in the Fig. 4(a) and (b) by the red dash-dot lines. The values

of the parameters inferred in both cases are summarized in the Table I.

We conclude that even in the case of incomplete corrupted by noise measurements

of the population dynamics our method allows one to recover both hidden dynamics of

V. COMPARISON OF PATH-INTEGRAL BASED INFERENCE WITH

MARKOV CHAIN MONTE CARLO METHOD

To compare directly the results of the reconstruction obtained by the path-integral

method and by MC algorithm we simplify problem and consider oscillations in a two-

dimensional system of the form

where ǫ = 0.1 and D11 = D22 = 0.04. We assume that only x1(t) is measured with

measurement noise η(t) of intensity N = 0.2 to produce an observed time series

approach as described above and Markov Chain Mote Carlo (MCMC) using Metropolis-

Hastings algorithm within Gibbs sampling scheme (see e.g. [38]). The results are shown

in the Fig. 4. It can be seen from the ﬁgure that the MCMC algorithm can indeed be

used to reconstruct dynamical trajectory from the noisy measurements. However, in the

case of missing variable the MCMC fails to recover correct solution. The reason is that

the later requires large smooth variations of the trajectory, while the MCMC algorithm

is searching in the space of discontinuous nondiﬀerentiable trajectories and as a result
converges to multiple deep spurious minima produced by the terms of the order (xk+1−xk)2

h2

in the cost function (3). Similar problem appears already in deterministic case [7], where

the multiple shooting technique is applied to solve the problem. We note that our approach

is more general. It is valid both in stochastic and deterministic case and avoids logistic

and technical problems related to dividing trajectory on arbitrary number of piece-wise

continuous solutions and on gluing these solution together.

Fig. 7(b,c,d).

VI. CONCLUSIONS

Is has been assumed up to now that a lack of observational data for predator popu-

lations constituted a fundamental obstacle to the inference of ecological parameters from

experimental data [5, 13, 14, 26]. A conclusion that can be drawn from the above results

that this is not necessarily the case. Using the methods described above it is possible to

reconstruct both invisible dynamics of predators population and the model parameters

directly from measurements of prey populations, even those containing some measurement

errors and uncertainties.

Note, that much of the studies across many scientiﬁc disciplines rely on the analysis

of the extremal properties of the eﬀective action similar to (3) in various function spaces

(cf. e.g. [23, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]). For example, solution of the problems of large occa-

sional deviations in noisy dynamical systems is given by the minimum of the functional

(3) with no measurement term. Unlike the dynamical inference searching for the tra-

jectory and model parameters that the system has with high probability, the theory of

large deviations is concerned with an optimal ﬂuctuation, or a least improbable path of

the system to reach a remote state from the attractor during the rare event. However

20

FIG. 7: (a) Measured variable x(t) for the following system parameters: D11 = 2.5, D22 = 3.0,
and D33 = 3.5, r = 28, σ = 10, b = 8/3. (b) and (c) Actual values of the unknown dynamical
variables y(t) and z(t) are shown by the black line. Inferred values are shown by the red dots. (d)
Actual trajectory of the system in 3D space of the variables x, y, z (black solid line) is compared
with the inferred trajectory (red line).

the solution of both problems provides a global minimum to the functional (3) in the

space of dynamical trajectories and is equivalent to a certain Hamiltonian dynamics in an

extended phase space. In the theory of large deviations the corresponding Hamiltonian

is called Wentzel-Friedlin Hamiltonian [3]. The dynamical quantities appearing within

this Hamiltonian theory have precise physical meaning and are accessible for direct ex-

perimental measurements [30, 32, 35]. Very similar optimization problems also occur in

the context of stochastic optimal control of large deviations [31, 32, 33] and the related

Hamiltonian can sometimes be identiﬁed [32] with so-called Pontryagin Hamiltonian [34]

playing a key role in the theory of optimal control. We note however that the dynamical

inference Hamiltonian HY (x, p) (4) is of a qualitatively new type. It depends explicitly

21

on the time-varying measurement signal y(t) that plays a role of a ’control force’ in the

Hamiltonian dynamics. These considerations suggest that the proposed path-integral ap-

proach to the problem of dynamical inference with hidden variables is a general one and

sets the solution of this problem into the standard mathematical context. It is valid both

in deterministic and stochastic case and is a natural generalization of the earlier ad hoc

approach to the dynamical inference of deterministic systems [7, 36].

We believe that methods of Hamiltonian theory will provide a new topological insight

to the solutions of complex problems of a dynamical inference with hidden variables.

For example, in many cases the observed data are not suﬃcient to discriminate with

high probability between the diﬀerent values of system parameters and/or the forms of

its hidden trajectory component. This corresponds to a certain ’degeneracy’ set in the

joint functional space (x(t),

) where the functional S takes a constant maximum value.

M

In general, the degeneracy set will be determined by the properties of the corresponding

Lagrangian manifold associated with the auxiliary Hamiltonian system (4) and conditions

p(0) = p(T ) = 0. We also note that whenever the dynamical inference converges to a right

solution the inferred system trajectory and parameter values correspond to a suﬃciently

capture some important properties of the real-world system (a so called, “model error”).

Overall, the locations of maxima of eﬀective action S dominating the LPDF, their relative

) answer

the statistical question of what can or cannot be learned with a high likelihood about

the system at hand given the available data and basic assumptions about the dynamical

model.

Our results also reveal a remarkable property of the dynamical inference with incom-

plete measurements.

is bounded from below by the dynamical and measurement noise. This

eﬀect can appear counterintuitive to a reader, because hidden variables and model param-

eters are trading against each other in the log-likelihood (3) that could seemingly cause

the parameter and trajectory errors to be comparable with each other. The explanation

for the above eﬀect is that the trajectory points x(tm) at closely spaced instances of time

tm are correlated with each other, those correlations are being extracted and accumulated

during the dynamical inference which we presented in the paper and this leads to the

shrinking of the parameter error with time below the noise level.

The proposed method should be applicable to a broad range of problems in science

and technology ranging from extracting parameters of molecular motors from the mea-

surements of their progression along microtubules [10, 37] to the inference of a climate

forcing mechanisms from reconstructed from the measurements of carbon dioxide in ocean

sediment [9]. We also expect this method to be particularly useful in the context of physi-

ological measurements where it is especially important to relate diﬃcult-to-access param-

eters to noninvasively-measured data [39, 40]. The open question to be addressed in the

near future is an extension of this theory to quantum and spatially extended systems.

APPENDIX: BAYESIAN INFERENCE OF CONTINUOUS NOISE-DRIVEN

DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS FROM INCOMPLETE MEASUREMENTS

Within the Bayesian framework the problem of dynamical inference is to determine

the conditional probability density functional (PDF) deﬁned over the set of the unknown

quantities (x(t),

), subject to observations y(t). The later, so-called posterior PDF,

pps[x(t);

of the observation record. We focus on demonstrating of the main eﬀect mentioned in

Conclusion and for brevity we assume that there are two dynamical variables, one of them,

x1, is hidden, and the other, x2, is observed with zero measurement error, x2(t) = y2(t).
We assume that the correlation matrix ˆD of the dynamical noise is diagonal with the small
nonzero matrix elements Dj ≡

We note that the integrand in the expression for a(T ) represents a sum of squares

and therefore a(T ) is a growing function of T , implying that the variance

down with T . Assume now that the measurement of the trajectory component y2(t) varies

periodically for large t (system approaches a periodic attractor). This variation will play a

role of a periodic forcing in Eqs. (34)-(36) and the long-time solutions of those equations,

ξ(t), η(t) will also have a periodic component. That means that a(T ) in (33) is growing

at least linearly with T , an assertion made in the Conclusion. Dynamical inference with

hidden variables in systems with chaotic attractors will be considered elsewhere.

[24] In a fully Bayesian scheme the inference from a given data set involves not only a likelihood

PDF but also a so-called prior PDF that (unlike the likelihood) does not depend on the

data set and is based on the previously available information. For simplicity, we do not

provide a full mathematical formulation involving prior PDF since our usage of it is very

limited. In particular, we use a prior information by simply ﬁxing the values of certain

parameters known from the previous measurements and infer the other parameters. However

the extension of our method to the fully Bayesian scheme is straightforward (see Appendix

A)

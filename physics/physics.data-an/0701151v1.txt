Abstract. Modularity is one of the most prominent properties of real-world complex
networks. Here, we address the issue of module identiﬁcation in an important class of
networks known as bipartite networks. Nodes in bipartite networks are divided into
two non-overlapping sets, and the links must have one end node from each set. We
suggest a novel approach especially suited for module detection in bipartite networks,
and deﬁne a set of random networks that permit the evaluation of the accuracy of the
new approach. Finally, we discuss how our approach can also be used to accurately
identify modules in directed unipartite networks.

Units in physical, chemical, biological, technological, and social systems interact
with each other deﬁning complex networks that are neither fully regular nor fully
random [1, 2, 3]. Among the most prominent and ubiquitous properties of these networks
is their modular structure [4, 2], that is, the existence of distinct groups of nodes with an
excess of connections to each other and fewer connections to other nodes in the network.
The existence of modular structure is important in several regards. First, modules
critically aﬀect the dynamic behavior of the system. The modular structure of the air
transportation system [5], for example, is likely to hold back or, at least, slow down the
spread of viruses at an international scale [6] and thus somewhat minimize the eﬀects of
high-connectivity nodes that may otherwise function as “super- spreaders” [7]. Second,
two modules in a complex modular network can have diﬀerent structural properties [8].
Therefore, characterizing the network using global average properties may result in the
misrepresentation of the structure of many, if not all, of the modules. Finally, from a
more formal point of view, the modular structure of networks is likely responsible for
at least some of the correlations (e.g. degree-degree correlations [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]),
that have attracted the interest of researchers in recent years [8].

1. Introduction

For all of these reasons, considerable attention has been given to the development
of algorithms and theoretical frameworks to identify and quantify the modular structure
of networks (see [15, 16] and references therein). However, current research activity has
paid little attention, except for a few studies by sociologists [17, 18], to the problem

Module identiﬁcation in bipartite networks with applications to directed networks

of identifying modules in a special and important class of networks known as bipartite
networks (or graphs). Nodes in bipartite networks are divided into two non-overlapping
sets, and the links must have one end node from each set. Examples of systems that
are more suitably represented as bipartite networks include:

• Protein-protein interaction networks [19, 20, 11, 21] obtained from yeast two hybrid
screening: one set of nodes represents the bait proteins and the other set represents
the prey or library proteins. Two proteins, a bait and a library protein, are
connected if the library protein binds to the bait.

• Plant-animal mutualistic networks [22, 23]: one set represents animal species and
the other set represents plant species. Links indicate mutualistic relationships
between animals and plants (for example, a certain bird species feeding on a plant
species and dispersing its seeds).

• Scientiﬁc publication networks [24, 25, 26, 27]: one set represents scientists and
the other set represents publications. A link between a scientist and a publication
indicates that the scientist is one of the authors of the publication.

• Artistic collaboration networks [28, 27]: one set represents artists and the other

teams. A link indicates the participation of an artist in a team.

Here, we address the issue of module identiﬁcation in complex bipartite networks.
We start by reviewing the approaches that are currently used heuristically and
aprioristically to solve this problem. We then suggest a new approach especially suited
for module detection in bipartite networks, and deﬁne a set of random networks that
permit the evaluation of the accuracy of the diﬀerent approaches.

This paper is organized as follows. In the next section we state what is the speciﬁc
problem we are interested in solving, and we review some prior work. In Section 3, we
suggest a quantitative measure of modularity for bipartite networks. In Section 4, we
introduce a model for bipartite networks with ﬁxed modular structure, which enables us
to quantitatively evaluate the performance of diﬀerent module identiﬁcation approaches.
In Section 5, we test diﬀerent approaches in a real bipartite network and in our model
bipartite networks. Finally, in Section 6, we discuss how it is possible to use the bipartite
formalism to identify modules in directed unipartite networks.

2. Background

For simplicity, from now on we denote the two sets of nodes in the bipartite network
as the set of actors and the set of teams, respectively. Given a bipartite network, we
are interested in identifying groups of actors, the modules, that are closely connected
to each other through co-participation in many teams‡.

We require any module-identiﬁcation algorithm to fulﬁll two quite general

conditions:

‡ Of course, we are free to select which set of nodes in a given network is the “actor set” and which
one is the “team set,” so we can identify modules in both sets.

• The algorithm needs to be network independent.

• Given the list of links in the network, the algorithm must determine not only a
good partition of the nodes into modules, but also the number of modules and their
sizes.

The ﬁrst condition is somewhat trivial. We just make it explicit to exclude
algorithms that are designed to work with a particular network or family of networks,
but that will otherwise fail with broad families of networks (for example, large networks
or sparse/dense networks).

The second condition is much more substantial, as it makes clear the diﬀerence
between the module-identiﬁcation problem and the graph partitioning problem in
computer science, in which both the number of groups and the sizes of the groups
are ﬁxed. To use a unipartite network analogy, given a set of 120 people attending a
wedding and information about who knows whom, the graph partitioning problem is
analogous to optimally setting 12 tables with 10 people in each table. In contrast, the
module-identiﬁcation problem is analogous to identifying “natural” groups of people,
for example the diﬀerent families or distinct groups of friends.

The second condition also excludes algorithms (based, for example, on hierarchical
clustering or principal component analysis [29]) that project network data into some
low-dimensional space without specifying how to select sharp boundaries in such low-
dimensional space. For example, given a dendogram generated using hierarchical
clustering, one still needs to decide where to “cut it” in order to obtain the relevant
modules. To be sure, one can propose a combination of algorithms that ﬁrst project
the data into some low-dimensional space and then set the boundaries, and assess the
In general, however, one cannot evaluate the performance
accuracy of the method.
of hierarchical clustering, given that hierarchical clustering does not provide a single
solution to module-identiﬁcation problem. Neither can one test the inﬁnite combinations
of dimensionality reduction algorithms with techniques for the actual selection of
modules.

Freeman [30] has recently compiled a collection of 21 algorithms that have been
used in the social networks literature to identify modules in bipartite networks. To
the best of our understanding none of the algorithms described there satisﬁes the two
conditions above. Among the statistical physics community, on the other hand, the
common practice is to project the bipartite network onto an actors’ network, and then
identify modules in the projection. In the scientists’ projection of a scientiﬁc publication
network, for example, two scientists are connected if they have coauthored one or more
papers. The caveat of this approach is that, even if the projection is weighted (by for
example, the number of papers coauthored by a pair of scientists), some information
of the original bipartite network, like the sizes of the teams, is lost in the projection.
Here, we suggest an alternative to existing approaches to identify modules in complex
bipartite networks.

3. Modularity for bipartite networks

In the spirit of the most successful method to date for the identiﬁcation of modules in
unipartite networks [31, 32, 16], we deﬁne a modularity function that, upon optimization,
yields the best possible partition of the actors into modules. By doing this, the module
identiﬁcation problem becomes a combinatorial optimization problem that is analogous
to the identiﬁcation of the ground state of a disordered magnetic system [33].

The rationale behind the modularity deﬁned by Newman and Girvan [34] for
links are not homogeneously
in a modular network,
unipartite networks is that,
distributed. Thus, a partition with high modularity is such that the density of links
inside modules is signiﬁcantly higher from the random expectation for such density.
Speciﬁcally, the modularity M(P) of a partition P of a network into modules is [34]

M(P) =

NM

s=1 "
X

,

where NM is the number of modules, L is the number of links in the network, ls is
the number of links between nodes in module s, and ds is the sum of the degrees of the
nodes in module s. Then ls/L is the fraction of links inside module s, and (ds/2L)2 is an
approximation (assuming that self-links and multiple links between nodes are allowed)
to the fraction of links one would expect to have inside the module from chance alone.
In the same spirit, we deﬁne a new modularity MB(P) that can be applied to
identify modules in bipartite networks. We start by considering the probability that a
given actor i belongs to a certain team a comprised of ma actors. This probability is
given by

where ti is the total number of modules to which node i belongs. Similarly, at the same
level of approximation as in Eq. (1), the probability that two nodes i and j belong to
the team is

Therefore, the average number of teams in which i and j are expected to be together is

Ensembles of random networks with prescribed modular structure [4] enable one to
assess algorithm’s performance quantitatively, and thus to compare algorithms to each
other. Here, we introduce an ensemble of random bipartite networks with prescribed
modular structure (Fig. 1).

We start by dividing the actors into NM of modules; each module s comprises
Ss nodes. For simplicity, we denote each module by a color. The network is then
created assuming that actors that belong to the same module have a higher probability
of being together in a team than actors that belong to diﬀerent modules§. Speciﬁcally,

§ This is, to some extent, an implicit deﬁnition of what modularity means in bipartite networks, in the

we proceed by creating NT teams as follows:

• Determine the size ma of the team.
• Determine the color ca of the team, that is, the module that will contribute, in

principle, the most actors to the team.

• For each spot in the team: (i) with probability p, select the actor from the pool
of actors that have the same color as the team; (ii) otherwise, select an actor at
random with equal probability. The parameter p, which we call team homogeneity,
thus quantiﬁes how homogeneous a team is. In the limiting cases, for p = 1 all the
actors in the team belong to the same module and modules are perfectly segregated,
whereas for p = 0 the color of the teams is irrelevant, actors are perfectly mixed
and the network does not have any modular structure.

5. Results

We next investigate the performance of diﬀerent module identiﬁcation algorithms in
both a simple real network that shows some interesting features, and in model networks
with predeﬁned modular structure.

We consider three approaches for the identiﬁcation of modules in bipartite networks.
First, we consider the unweighted projection (UWP) approach. Within this approach,
we start by building the projection of the bipartite network into the actors space. Then
we consider the projection as a regular unipartite network and use the modularity given
in Eq. (1).

Second, we consider the weighted projection (WP) approach. Within this approach,
we start by building the weighted projection of the bipartite network. In the simplest
weighted projection, actors are connected if they are together in one or more teams,
and the weight of the link indicates the number of teams in which the two actors are
together. We then use the simplest generalization of the modularity in Eq. (1), in which
numbers of links are replaced by sum of the weights of links, and node degrees are
replaced by node strengths [35].

Third and last, we consider the bipartite (B) approach. Within this approach, we

consider the whole bipartite network and use the modularity introduced in Eq. (5).

In all cases, we maximize the modularity using simulated annealing [36]. Several
alternatives have been suggested to maximize the modularity including greedy search
[37], extremal optimization [38], and spectral methods [39, 40]. In general, there is a
trade-oﬀ between accuracy and execution time, with simulated annealing being the most
accurate method [16], but at present too slow to deal properly with networks comprising
hundreds of thousands or millions of nodes.

same way that “higher linkage probability inside modules” is a deﬁnition of what modularity means in
unipartite networks.

the unweighted projection (UWP) approach. (b) Modular structure as obtained from
the weighted projection (WP) approach and the bipartite (B) approach. The UWP
approach fails to capture the real modular structure of the network.

5.1. Southern women dataset

During the 1930s, ethnographers Allison Davis, Elizabeth Stubbs Davis, J. G. St. Clair
Drake, Burleight B. Gardner, and Mary R. Gardner collected data on social stratiﬁcation
in the town of Natchez, Mississippi [41, 30]. Part of their ﬁeld work consisted in collecting
data on women’s attendance to social events in the town. The researchers later analyzed
the resulting women-event bipartite network in the light of other social and ethnographic
variables. Since then, the dataset has become a de facto standard for discussing bipartite
networks in the social sciences [30].

Here we analyze the modules of both women and events. We start by considering the
unweighted projection of the network in the women’s space (two women are connected
if they co-attended to at least one event), and in the events’ space (two events are
connected if at least one woman was in both events). As we show in Fig. 2a, the
unweighted projection does not capture the true modular structure of the network. The
failure of this approach is due to the fact that the projections are very dense. For
example, some central events were attended by most women and thus most pairs of
women are connected in the projection.

In contrast, the weighted projection approach and the bipartite approach yield the
exact same results (Fig. 2b), which do capture the two-module structure of the network.
Except for one woman, the partition coincides with the original partition proposed by
the ethnographers who collected the data, and is in perfect agreement with some of the
supervised algorithms reviewed in Ref. [30].

5.2. Model bipartite networks

Next, we consider the performance of the diﬀerent module identiﬁcation approaches
when applied to the model bipartite networks described in Section 4. We assess the
performance of an algorithm by comparing the partitions it returns to the a priori ﬁxed
partition. Speciﬁcally, we use the mutual information IAB [16] between partitions A and
B to quantify the performance of the algorithms

In the simplest version of the model all modules have the same number of nodes, all
teams have the same size, and the color of each team is set assuming equal probability
for each color. Unless otherwise stated, we build networks with NM = 4 modules, each
of them comprising 32 actors, and NT = 128 teams of size m = 14.

5.2.1. Team homogeneity We ﬁrst investigate how team homogeneity p aﬀects
algorithm performance. For p = 1, all the actors in a team belong to the same
module, and any reasonable algorithm must perfectly identify the modular structure
of the network; thus I = 1. Conversely, for p = 0, actors are perfectly mixed in teams,
and all algorithms will return random partitions due to small ﬂuctuations [33]; thus
I = 0. Any p > 0 must provide a signal that an algorithm can, in principle, use.

As shown in Fig. 3, the UWP approach performs systematically and signiﬁcantly

worse than the weighted projection and the bipartite algorithms for all values of p. For
the choice of parameters described above, the last two algorithms start to be able to
identify the modular structure of the network for p ≈ 0.30. For p ≥ 0.5, one already
ﬁnds I > 0.9. Remarkably, for the parameters considered, the WP and the B approaches
yield essentially indistinguishable results.

5.2.2. Number of teams and average team size Team homogeneity is not the only
parameter aﬀecting algorithm performance. For example, the number of teams NT
in the network critically aﬀects the amount of information available to an algorithm.
Interestingly, the number of teams aﬀects in diﬀerent ways the UWP approach on the
one hand, and the WP and B approaches on the other (Fig. 4). For the WP and B
algorithms, the larger NT , the larger the amount of information and therefore the easier
the problem becomes. Indeed, even for very small values of p, the signal to noise ratio
can become signiﬁcantly greater than 1 if NT is large enough. On the contrary, as the
number of teams increases the UWP becomes denser and denser and eventually becomes
a fully connected graph, from which the algorithm cannot extract any useful information.
Once more, the performance of the WP and the B approaches are indistinguishable.

5.2.3. Team size distribution All the results so far suggest that the WP approach
and the B approach yield results that are indistinguishable from each other. We know,
however, that diﬀerences do exist between both. The distribution of team sizes, in
particular, is considered in the B approach but disregarded in the WP approach. In
particular, “teams” with m = 1 are totally disregarded in projection-based approaches,
but not in the B approach.

We thus investigate what is the eﬀect of the team size distribution on the

Instead of considering that all teams have the same

which is the discrete counterpart of the exponential distribution. The distribution has
mean hmi = µ.

As shown in Fig. 5, some small diﬀerences between the WP approach and the B
approach are indeed noticeable as we change the average team size. For small average
team sizes, the B approach slightly outperforms the WP approach. Conversely, for
intermediate average team sizes the WP approach seems to slightly outperform the B
approach.

5.2.4. Module size heterogeneity In real networks, modules will have (sometimes
dramatically) diﬀerent sizes. Given the sizes of the modules in a network, and assuming
that they are ordered so that S1 ≥ S2 ≥ . . . ≥ SNM , we deﬁne h as the ratio of sizes
between consecutive modules (up to integer limitations)

h =

Si+1
Si

.

(8)

Additionally, we select the color of the teams with probabilities proportional to the size
of the corresponding module, so that all actors participate, on average, in the same
number of teams.

As shown in Fig. 6, we again observe slight, but signiﬁcant, diﬀerences between
the WP and the B. In this case, the B approach seems to consistently outperform the
WP approach for all values of h < 1. We hypothesize that this behavior is due to the

tendency of the WP approach to merge the smallest modules with some of the bigger
ones.

6. Application to directed networks

Another important class of networks for which no satisfactory module identiﬁcation
algorithm has so far been proposed is directed unipartite networks. In order to tackle
this class of networks, we note that directed networks can be conveniently represented
as bipartite networks where each node is represented by two nodes Ii and Oi. A directed
link from i to j would be represented in the bipartite network as an edge connecting Oi
to Ij.

Consider, for example, a network in which nodes are companies and links represent
investments of one company into another. By considering each company as two diﬀerent
objects, one that makes investments and one that receives investments, the directed
network can be represented as an undirected bipartite network. Modules in the set of
objects that make investments correspond to groups of companies that invest in the
same set of companies, that is, groups of companies with a similar investing strategy.

The most widely used approach to identify communities in directed networks is to
disregard the directionality of the links and identify modules using a method suitable
for undirected unipartite networks. This method might work in some situations, but
will fail when diﬀerent modules are deﬁned based on incoming and outgoing links.

Consider, for instance, the simple model network depicted in Fig. 7a. According
to the outgoing links of the nodes this network has two modules: nodes 1-12 and nodes
13-24. According to the incoming links of the nodes the network has also two modules,
but they are diﬀerent: nodes 1-6 and 13-18 on the one hand, and nodes 7-12 and 19-24

Figure 7. Application of the bipartite approach to the identiﬁcation of modules in
directed networks. (a) A directed model network. A link from node i to node j is
established according to the probabilities in the matrix on the left. For example, there
is a probability pi that there is a link from node 1 to node 13. In particular, we use
pi = 0.45 > po = 0.05 to generate the directed network on the right. (b) Bipartite
representation of the network in (a). Each node i is in (a) is represented by two nodes
here, a circle Ai and a square Bi. All links in the bipartite network run between
circles and diamonds, and a link between Ai and Bj corresponds to a link from i to j
in the directed network. (c) Modules identiﬁed in the bipartite network. (d) Modules
identiﬁed from the directed network disregarding link direction. Here, we use the same
color for Ai and Bi, since this approach does not make distinctions between incoming
and outgoing links.

on the other. A simple layout of the corresponding bipartite network (Fig. 7b) already
makes clear the modular structure of the network, and any of the approaches described
above (UWP, WP, and B) is able to identify the in-modules and out-modules correctly
(Fig. 7c). Disregarding the direction of the links, however, results in modules that fail
to capture the modular structure of the network (Fig. 7d).

7. Discussion

In this work, we have focused on approaches that aim at identifying modules in each
of the two sets of nodes in the bipartite network independently. There are two main

reasons for this choice. First, methodologically our choice enables comparison with
projection-based algorithms, which, by deﬁnition, cannot identify modules of actors
and teams simultaneously. Second, in most situations it is reasonable to assume that
two actors belong to the same module if they co-participate in many teams, regardless
of whether the teams themselves belong to the same module or not. An alternative
approach, however, would be to group nodes in both sets at the same time.

Another interesting observation relates to the optimization algorithm used to
maximize the modularity. Although we have chosen to use simulated annealing to
obtain the best possible accuracy [31, 32, 16], one can trivially use the new modularity
introduced in Eq. (5) with faster algorithms such as greedy search [37] or extremal
optimization [38].

Interestingly, one can also use the spectral methods introduced in [39, 40]. Indeed,
just as the unipartite modularity M(P ), the bipartite modularity MB(P) can be
rewritten in matrix form as

MB(P) = gTBg ,

where gis = 1 if node i belongs to module s and 0 otherwise, and the elements of the
modularity matrix B are deﬁned as

Finally, a few words are necessary on the comparison between the diﬀerent
approaches. First, we have shown that the (so far preferred) unweighted projection
approach is not reliable and can lead, in quite general situations, to wrong results.
Therefore, we believe that this approach should not be used. As for the weighted
projection approach and the bipartite approach, we have shown that their performance
is very similar. We have also pointed out, however, that they can and do give noticeably
diﬀerent results in some situations. Given this, we believe that the bipartite approach
has a more straightforward interpretation and would be preferable in cases in which the
modular structure of the network is unknown.

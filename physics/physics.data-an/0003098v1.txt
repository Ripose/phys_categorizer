Abstract

The proper way of averaging is an important question with regards to Tsal-

lis’ Thermostatistics. Three diﬀerent procedures have been thus far employed

in the pertinent literature. The third one, i.e., the Tsallis-Mendes-Plastino

(TMP) [1] normalization procedure, exhibits clear advantages with respect to

earlier ones. In this work, we advance a distinct (from the TMP-one) way of

handling the Lagrange multipliers involved in the extremization process that

leads to Tsallis’ statistical operator. It is seen that the new approach consid-

erably simpliﬁes the pertinent analysis without losing the beautiful properties

of the Tsallis-Mendes-Plastino formalism.

I. INTRODUCTION

Tsallis’ thermostatistics [1–6] is by now recognized as a new paradigm for statistical

mechanical considerations. One of its crucial ingredients, Tsallis’ normalized probability

distribution [1], is obtained by following the well known MaxEnt route [7]. One maximizes

Tsallis’ generalized entropy [3,8]

(k ≡ k(q) tends to the Boltzmann constant kB in the limit q → 1 [2]) subject to the

where pi is the probability assigned to the microscopic conﬁguration i (i = 1, . . . , w) and one

(j = 1, . . . , n) denote the n relevant observables

(the observation level [9]), whose generalized expectation values hhOjiiq are (assumedly) a

priori known.

The Lagrange multipliers recipe entails maximizing [1]

The above procedure, originally employed in [1], overcomes most of the problems posed

by the old, unnormalized way of evaluating Tsallis’generalized mean values [1,11]. Some

hardships remain, though. One of them is that numerical diﬃculties are sometimes encoun-

tered, as the pi expression is explicitly self-referential. An even more serious problem is also

faced: a maximum is not necessarily guaranteed. Indeed, analyzing the concomitant Hessian

so as to ascertain just what kind of extreme we face, one encounters the unpleasant fact

that this Hessian is not diagonal.

In the present eﬀort we introduce an alternative Lagrange route, that overcomes the

above mentioned problems.

II. THE NEW LAGRANGE MULTIPLIERS’ SET

We extremize again (1) subject to the constraints (3), but, and herein lies the central

idea, rephrase (4) by recourse to the alternative form

wXi=1

pq

i(cid:16)O(i)

j − hhOjiiq(cid:17) = 0,

with j = 1, . . . , n. We have now

F = Sq − α0  wXi=1

pi − 1! −

λ′
j

nXj=1

wXi=1

pq

i (cid:16)O(i)

j − hhOjiiq(cid:17) ,

(8)

(9)

so that, following the customary variational procedure and eliminating α0 we ﬁnd that the

probabilities are, formally, still given by (5). However, in terms of the new set of Lagrange

multipliers, the conﬁgurational characteristics do not depend explicitly on the probabilities

f ′
i = 1 −

(1 − q)

k Xj

λ′

j(cid:16)O(i)

j − hhOjiiq(cid:17) .

(10)

Comparing (10) with (6), it is clear that the Lagrange multipliers λj of the Tsallis-

Mendes-Plastino formalism (TMP) [1] and λ′

j (present treatment) can be connected via

,

(11)

λ′
j =

Pi pq

i

λj

3

which leads to the nice result f ′

i = fi. The probabilities that appear in (11) are those special

ones that maximize the entropy, not generic ones. The ensuing, new partition function is

also of the form (7), with fi > 0 the well known Tsallis’ cut-oﬀ condition [3,8]. Notice that

now the expression for the MaxEnt probabilities pi is NOT explicitly self-referential.

In order to ascertain the kind of extreme we are here facing we study the Hessian, that

now is of diagonal form. The maximum condition simpliﬁes then to the requirement

∂2F
∂p2
i

< 0.

The above derivatives are trivially performed yielding

∂2F
∂p2
i

= −qpq−2

i

fi,

(12)

(13)

which formally coincides with the maximum requirement one ﬁnds in the case of Tsallis’

unnormalized formalism. Since the fi are positive-deﬁnite quantities, for a maximum one

should demand that q > 0.

Extremes found by following the celebrated Lagrange procedure depend only on the

nature of the constraints, not on the form in which they are expressed. Thus, the two sets

of multipliers lead to the same numerical values for the micro-state probabilities. Via (11)

one is always able to establish a connection between both treatments.

The present algorithm exhibits the same nice properties of the TMP formalism, namely:

• The MaxEnt probabilities are invariant under uniform shifts of the Hamiltonian’s

energy spectrum (see, for instance, the illuminating discussion of Di Sisto et al. [12]).

Indeed, after performing the transformation

ǫi → ǫi + ǫ0

Uq → Uq − ǫ0,

(14)

(15)

on equation (5), with fi given by (10), we trivially ﬁnd that the probabilities pi keep

their forms invariant if the λ′

j do not change. Due to relation (11), the λj are invariant

too.

4

• The mean value of unity equals unity, i.e., hh1iiq = 1, which is not the case with the

unnormalized expectation values [3,8].

• One easily ﬁnds that, for two independent subsystems A, B, energies add up: Uq(A +

B) = Uq(A) + Uq(B).

III. THERMODYNAMICS

We pass now to the question of writing down the basic mathematical relationships of

Thermodynamics, as expressed with respect to the new set of Lagrange multipliers λ′
j.

In order to do this in the most general quantal fashion we shall work in a basis-

independent way. This requires consideration of the statistical operator (or density operator)

ˆρ that maximizes Tsallis’ entropy, subject to the foreknowledge of M generalized expectation

values (corresponding to M operators bOj). These take the form

,

j = 1, ..., M.

DDbOjEEq

=

T r(ˆρqbOj)

T r(ˆρq)

To these we must add, of course, the normalization requirement

T r ˆρ = 1.

(16)

(17)

The TMP formalism, where relations are written in terms of the “old” Lagrange multi-

pliers λj, yields the usual thermodynamical relationships [1], namely

∂S

= kλj

∂DDbOjEEq
(lnq Zq) = −DDbOjEEq

∂

where

(18)

(19)

(20)

lnq Zq = lnq ¯Zq −Xj

so that the essential mathematical structure of Thermodynamics is preserved.

Following the standard procedure [5,13] one gets

where ¯Zq stands for the partition function

(21)

(22)

(23)

Enters here Tsallis’cut-oﬀ condition [5,13]. The form (22) does not a priori guarantee

that we will have a positive-deﬁnite operator. Some additional considerations are requested.

Consider the operator

bA = 1 − (1 − q)Xj

λ′

j(cid:18)bOj −DDbOjEEq(cid:19)

(24)

enclosed within parentheses in (22). One must ensure its positive-deﬁnite character. This

entails that the eigenvalues of ˆA must be non-negative quantities. This can be achieved by

recourse to an heuristic cut-oﬀ procedure. We replace (22) by

with ¯Zq given by

ˆρ = ¯Z −1

q

h ˆA Θ( ˆA)i1/(1−q)

,

¯Zq = T rh ˆA Θ( ˆA)i1/(1−q)

,

(25)

(26)

where Θ(x) is the Heaviside step-function. Equations (25)-(26) are to be re-interpreted

as follows. Let |ii and αi, stand, respectively, for the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the

operator (24), whose spectral decomposition is then

ˆA =Xi

αi |ii hi| .

(27)

In the special basis used above ˆρ adopts the appearance

6

with f (x) deﬁned as

ˆρ = ¯Z −1

q Xi

f (αi) |ii hi| ,

f (x) = 0, f or x ≤ 0,

f (x) = x

1−q , f or x > 0.

(28)

(29)

(30)

Notice that f (x) possesses, for 0 < q < 1, a continuous derivative for all x. Moreover,

df (x)

dx

=  1

q − 1! [xΘ(x)]

q

In terms of the statistical operator, Tsallis’ entropy Sq reads

(31)

(32)

where ˆI is the unity operator.

Obviously, ˆρ commutes with ˆA. The product of these two operators can be expressed in

the common basis that diagonalizes them

which entails, passing from the special basis |ii to the general situation, that

[f (αi)]q αi|iihi|,

ˆρq ˆA Θ( ˆA) = ¯Z −q

(35)

and, consequently

Sq =

Since the last term of the right-hand-side vanishes, by deﬁnition (8), we ﬁnally arrive at

7

Sq =

¯Z q−1

q − 1
q − 1

T r (ˆρq) .

Now, from the very deﬁnition (in terms of ˆρ) of Tsallis’ entropy Sq [5,13], we ﬁnd

so that (36) and (37) lead to

and

T r (ˆρq) = 1 +

(1 − q)

k

Sq,

T r(ˆρq) = ¯Z 1−q

Sq = k lnq ¯Zq,

where lnq ¯Zq has been introduced in (20).

Using (38), equation (11) can be rewritten as

Following [1] we deﬁne now

and introduce

lnq Z ′

q = lnq ¯Zq −Xj

λ′

k′ = k ¯Z 1−q

which leads ﬁnally to (see (18) and (19))

(37)

(38)

(39)

(40)

(41)

(42)

(43)

(44)

Equations (43) and (44) constitute the basic Information Theory relations on which to

build up, `a la Jaynes [7], Statistical Mechanics.

8

Notice that k′, as deﬁned by (42), obeys the condition k′ → kB as q → 1. This is a

condition that this constant must necessarily fulﬁll (see [2]). Comparing (18) and (43) one

arrives at the important relationship

k′λ′

j = kλj,

(45)

which entails that the intensive variables are invariant under the λ′ → λ transformation.

As a special instance of Eqs. (43) and (44) let us discuss the Canonical Ensemble, where

they adopt the appearance

= k′β′ = kβ =

T

∂S
∂Uq
∂

∂β′ (cid:16)lnq Z ′

q(cid:17) = −Uq,

where (see equation (41))

lnq Z ′

q = lnq ¯Zq − β′Uq.

(46)

(47)

(48)

¿From Equation (46) one notices that the temperature T is the same for both multipliers’

sets. Finally, the speciﬁc heat reads

Cq =

∂Uq
∂T

= −k′β′2 ∂Uq
∂β′ .

(49)

We conclude that the mathematical form of the thermodynamic relations is indeed pre-

served by the present treatment. Both sets of Lagrange multipliers accomplish this feat and

they are connected via (11). The primed one, however, allows for a simpler treatment, as

will be illustrated below.

IV. SIMPLE APPLICATIONS

We consider now some illustrative examples. They are chosen in such a manner that

each of them discusses a diﬀerent type of situation: classical and quantal systems, the latter

in the case of both ﬁnite and inﬁnite number of levels.

9

A. The classical harmonic oscillator

Let us consider the classical harmonic oscillator in the canonical ensemble. We can

associate with the classical oscillator a continuous energy spectrum ǫ(n) = ǫ n with ǫ > 0

and n ∈ R+ compatible with the cut-oﬀ condition. The ensuing MaxEnt probabilities adopt

the appearance

where

and

pq(n, t′) =

[fq(n, t′)]1/(1−q)

¯Zq(t′)

,

fq(n, t′) = 1 − (1 − q)

(n − uq)

t′

,

¯Zq(t′) =Z nmax

0

[fq(n, t′)]1/(1−q) dn,

(50)

(51)

(52)

with uq = Uq/ǫ and t′ = k′T /ǫ. We have introduced also nmax as the upper integration limit

on account of Tsallis’ cut-oﬀ condition. One appreciates the fact that nmax → ∞ if q > 1.

nmax is, of course, the maximum n-value that keeps [fq(n, t′)]1/(1−q) > 0 for q < 1.

The normalization condition reads

0

uq(t′) = R nmax
R nmax

0

[pq(n, t′)]q n dn
[pq(n, t′)]q dn

,

or, using (50),

0

uq(t′) = R nmax
R nmax

0

[fq(n, t′)]q/(1−q) n dn
[fq(n, t′)]q/(1−q) dn

(53)

(54)

.

Due to the form of fq, equation (54) constitutes a well-deﬁned expression. By explicitly

performing the integrals for 1 < q < 2 (for q ≥ 2 the integrals diverge) we obtain

uq(t′) =

t′2/(2 − q)(1 + (1 − q)uq/t′)(2−q)/(1−q)

t′(1 + (1 − q)uq/t′)1/(1−q)

.

(55)

After a little algebra, the above equation leads to the simple result

10

uq(t′) = t′.

(56)

Replacing now uq = Uq/ǫ and t′ = k′T /ǫ, we obtain Uq = k′T , so that the speciﬁc heat

reads

Cq = k′.

(57)

It is worthwhile to remark that, in the case of this particular example, we formally

regain the usual expressions typical of the q = 1 case. Due to fact that we possess a degree of

freedom in the deﬁnition of k′, we can set k′ = kB and thus recover Gibbs’ Thermodynamics.

Performing the pertinent integral and using (56), the partition function becomes

¯Zq(t′) = t′(2 − q)1/(1−q).

(58)

According to equation (40), t′ can be written in terms of t and ¯Zq, allowing us to recover

[1]

and, consequently,

¯Zq(t) = t1/q(2 − q)1/[q(1−q)],

uq = t1/q(2 − q)1/q

Cq =

k
2

(2 − q)1/qt(1−q)/q.

(59)

(60)

(61)

These results are identical to those of [1], but are here derived in a remarkably simpler

fashion.

B. The two-level system and the quantum harmonic oscillator

Let us consider the discrete case of a single particle with an energy spectrum given by

En = ǫn, where ǫ > 0 and n = 0, 1, ..., N.

If N = 1, we are facing the non degenerate

two level system, while, if n → ∞, the attendant problem is that of the quantum harmonic

oscillator.

11

The micro-state probabilities are of the form, once again

with

pn =

f 1/(1−q)
n

¯Zq

¯Zq =

NXn=0

fn

1/(1−q).

The conﬁgurational characteristics take the form

fn(t′) = 1 − (1 − q)(n − uq)/t′

where again (see (IV A)), t′ = k′T /ǫ and uq = Uq/k′.

Using (62), the mean energy can be written as

(62)

(63)

(64)

(65)

uq = PN
PN

n

n=0 f q/(1−q)
n
n=0 f q/(1−q)

,

n

which, using the explicit form of fn and rearranging terms, allows one to write down the

following equation

NXn=0"1 −

(1 − q)

t′

(n − uq)#q/(1−q)

(n − uq) = 0,

(66)

which implicitly deﬁnes uq. Notice that one does not arrive to a closed expression. However,

in order to numerically solve for uq, we just face (66). This equation is easily solved by

recourse to the so-called “seed” methods (cut-oﬀ always taken care of), with quick conver-

gence (seconds). This is to be compared to the TMP instance [1]. In their case, one faces a

non-linear coupled system of equations in order to accomplish the same task. This coupled

system can be recovered from (66) and (62), writing t′ in terms of t.

C. Magnetic Systems

Consider now a very simple magnetic model, discussed, for instance, in [14]: a quantum

system of N spin 1/2 non-interacting atoms in the presence of a uniform, external magnetic

ﬁeld ~H = H ˆk (oriented along the unit vector ˆk). Each atom is endowed with a magnetic

12

(i)

(i)

= g µ0b~S

, where µ0 = e/(2mc) is Bohr’s magneton and b~S

standing for the Pauli matrices. The concomitant interaction energy reads

(i)

= (¯h/2)b~σ

, with

(67)

ˆH = −

the total (collective) spin operator. The simultaneous eigenvectors of

where b~S = PN
i=1 b~S
b~S
and bSz constitute a basis of the concomitant 2N -dimensional space. We have |S, Mi, with

S = δ, . . . , N/2, M = −S, . . . , S, and δ ≡ N/2 − [N/2] = 0 (1/2) if N is even (odd). The

corresponding multiplicities are Y (S, M) = Y (S) = N!(2S + 1)/[(N/2 − S)!(N/2 + S + 1)!]

[14]. We recast the Hamiltonian in the simple form

ˆH = −

x′
β′

ˆSz,

with x′ = gµ0Hβ′/¯h. Our statistical operator can be written as

ˆρ =

1

¯Zq (cid:20)1 − (1 − q)x′(cid:18) ˆSz −DD ˆSzEEq(cid:19)(cid:21)1/(1−q)

,

where

¯Zq = T r(cid:20)1 − (1 − q)x′(cid:18) ˆSz −DD ˆSzEEq(cid:19)(cid:21)1/(1−q)
Due to the cut-oﬀ condition, 1 − (1 − q)x′(cid:18) ˆSz −DD ˆSzEEq(cid:19) > 0.

.

The mean value of the spin z-component is computed according to (16)

DD ˆSzEEq

=

T r(cid:16)ˆρq ˆSz(cid:17)

T r (ˆρq)

,

so that, replacing (69) into (71) and rearranging then terms we arrive at

T r((cid:20)1 + (1 − q)x′(cid:18) ˆSz −DD ˆSzEEq(cid:19)(cid:21)q/(1−q)(cid:18) ˆSz −DD ˆSzEEq(cid:19)) = 0.

More explicitly, one has

N/2XS=δ

Y (S)

SXM =−S(cid:20)1 + (1 − q)x′(cid:18)M −DD ˆSzEEq(cid:19)(cid:21)q/(1−q)(cid:18)M −DD ˆSzEEq(cid:19) = 0,

13

(68)

(69)

(70)

(71)

(72)

(73)

which is the equation to be solved in order to ﬁnd DD ˆSzEEq

.

Notice that, once again, one faces just a single equation, that can be easily tackled. If one

uses instead the TMP prescription (as discussed in [15]) one has to solve a coupled, highly

non-linear system of equations. Such a system can be recovered from (73) if one replaces x′

by x/T r(ρq) and adds the condition T r(ρq) from (69).

As in [15], we consider now two asymptotic situations from the present viewpoint.

For x′ → 0 we Taylor-expand (73) around x′ = 0 and ﬁnd

DD ˆSzEEq

=

qx′N

4

,

that leads to an eﬀective particle number

N 0

ef f = qN,

as in [15]. Following the same mechanism and using (74), one ﬁnds that

T r(ρq) = 2N (1−q).

(74)

(75)

(76)

Remembering that x′ = x/T r(ρq), it is possible to recover the TMP normalized solution

[15]

and

DD ˆSzEEq

=

qxN

4

2N (q−1),

N 0 (3)

ef f = qN 2N (q−1).

(77)

(78)

For x′ → ∞, and for 0 < q < 1, expression (73) leads to an equation identical to that of

[15]

SXM =−S(cid:18)M −DD ˆSzEEq(cid:19)1/(1−q)

= 0,

(79)

N/2XS=δ
whose solution reads DD ˆSzEEq

Y (S)

= N/2.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In order to obtain the probability distribution pi that maximizes Tsallis’ entropy subject

to appropriate constraints, Tsallis-Mendes-Plastino extremize [1]

j − hhOjiiq(cid:17)

,

and ¯Zq is the partition function. Two rather unpleasant facts are thus faced, namely,

• pi explicitly depends upon the probability distribution (self-reference).

• The Hessian of F is not diagonal.

In this work we have devised a transformation from the original set of Lagrange multi-

pliers {λj} to a new set {λ′

j} such that

• Self-reference is avoided.

• The Hessian of F becomes diagonal.

As a consequence, all calculations, whether analytical or numerical, become much simpler

than in [1], as illustrated with reference to several simple examples. The primed multipliers

incorporate the pi

1 in their deﬁnition. Since one solves directly for the primed multipliers,

λ′
j =

λj

Pi pq

i

such a simple step considerably simpliﬁes the TMP treatment. Finally, we remark on the fact

that the two sets of multipliers lead to thermodynamical relationships that involve identical

intensive quantities (45).

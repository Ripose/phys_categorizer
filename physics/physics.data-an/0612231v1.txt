Abstract

It is generally recognized that economical systems, and more in general complex
systems, are characterized by power law distributions. Sometime, these distributions
show a changing of the slope in the tail so that, more appropriately, they show a
multi-power law behavior. We present a method to derive analytically a two-power
law distribution starting from a single power law function recently obtained, in the
frameworks of the generalized statistical mechanics based on the Sharma-Taneja-
Mittal information measure. In order to test the method, we ﬁt the cumulative
distribution of personal income and gross domestic production of several countries,
obtaining a good agreement for a wide range of data.

Key words: Two-power law distribution, Sharma-Taneja-Mittal information
measure, distribution of personal income and gross domestic production.

1 Introduction

Free-scale behavior in the economical systems have been observed since 19th
century, when Pareto noticed that the cumulative distribution of the personal
∞
x p(y) dy of several countries behaves like a power law func-
income P (x) =
R
tion. Afterwards, Gibrat clariﬁed that such a power law behavior holds only
for the high income region, whilst in the low-middle income region, which in-
cludes almost the whole body of data, the curve is well ﬁtted by a log-normal
distribution.
Actually, the problem concerning the real proﬁle showed by the function P (x)
in the whole range of the accessible data is still an open question. In particular,

it has been suggested [1] that deformed exponential functions derived recently
in the ﬁeld of the generalized statistical mechanics, can be fruitfully employed
to modeling analytically the cumulative distribution P (x) for a wide range of
the income values.
Notwithstanding, the recent analysis based on a huge quantity of data nowa-
days accessible, shown that sometime the crossover among the low-middle
region (the log-normal region) and the high region in the upper tail of the
x−s, where
distribution (the Pareto region, with a power law behavior P (x)
s is a positive constants quite generally 1
2), does not occur smoothly,
giving origin to knee or ankle eﬀects (see for instance [2]). Moreover, in some
cases, it has been observed a deviation from the Pareto behavior in the high-
x−˜s with a
est region, which can originate a new power law behavior P (x)
diﬀerent slope ˜s
The complicate proﬁle in the shape of P (x) cannot be accounted for by a
generalized exponential with a single power law behavior. This open the ques-
tions: how can we describe the shape observed in P (x) with an analytically
simple function?
In the present contribution, we introduce a mechanism which permits to gen-
erate multi-power law functions by employing deformed exponentials and log-
arithms with a single power law asymptotic behavior.
Notice that, two-power law behavior have been observed in various econom-
ical systems like, for instance, in the cumulative distribution of the personal
income [3], in the cumulative distribution of the land price [4] or in the returns
of many market indexes [5].
On a general ground, two-power law behavior have been observed in diﬀerent
physics ﬁelds as well as in biological, geological and social sciences. Among
the many, we quote the dielectric relaxation [6], the re-association in folder
proteins [7], and others [8].
It is worthy to remark that there have been proposed diﬀerent methods in
literature [7,9,10] to produce generalized distributions with a double-power
law behavior which diﬀer from the one advanced in the following.

6 Conclusions

We have derived a simple method which permits to generate functions with
a multi-power law behavior starting the deformed logarithm ln{κ, r}(x) and
the deformed exponential exp{κ, r}(x), recently derived in [11], which exhibit
a single power law proﬁle. An explicit two-power law function has been con-
structed starting from the κ-exponential and its inverse, the κ-logarithm. We
have employed this function to ﬁt the inverse cumulative distribution of the
personal income and of the gross domestic production of several countries,
showing a good agreement among the analytical and the empirical data for a
wide range of values.

Signal discovery in sparse spectra: a Bayesian analysis

Abstract

A Bayesian analysis of the probability of a signal in the presence
of background is developed, and criteria are proposed for claiming ev-
idence for, or the discovery of a signal. The method is general and in
particular applicable to sparsely populated spectra. Monte Carlo tech-
niques to evaluate the sensitivity of an experiment are described.

As an example, the method is used to calculate the sensitivity of the

GERDA experiment to neutrinoless double beta decay.

1 Introduction

In the analysis of sparsely populated spectra common approximations, valid
only for large numbers, fail for the small number of events encountered. A
Bayesian analysis of the probability of a signal in the presence of background is
developed, and criteria are proposed for claiming evidence for, or the discovery
of a signal. It is independent of the physics case and can be applied to a variety
of situations.

To make predictions about possible outcomes of an experiment, distribu-
tions of quantities under study are calculated. As an approximation, ensem-
bles, sets of Monte Carlo data which mimic the expected spectrum, are ran-
domly generated and analyzed. The frequency distributions of output param-
eters of the Bayesian analysis are interpreted as probability densities and are
used to evaluate the sensitivity of the experiment to the process under study.
As an example, the analysis method is used to estimate the sensitivity of

the GERDA experiment [1] to neutrinoless double beta decay.

The analysis strategy is introduced in section 2. The generation of ensem-
bles and the application of the method onto those is discussed in section 3.
The application of the analysis method in the GERDA experiment is given as
an example in section 4 where the sensitivity of the experiment is evaluated.

2 Spectral analysis

A common situation in the analysis of data is the following: two types of
processes (referred to as signal and background in the following) potentially

1

contribute to a measured spectrum. The basic questions which are to be
answered can be phrased as: What is the contribution of the signal process
to the observed spectrum? What is the probability that the spectrum is due to
background only? Given a model for the signal and background, what is the
(most probable) parameter value describing the number of signal events in the
spectrum? In case no signal is observed, what is the limit that can be set on the
signal contribution? The analysis method introduced in this paper is based on
Bayes’ Theorem and developed to answer these questions and is in particular
suitable for spectra with a small number of events.
The assumptions for the analysis are

• The spectrum is conﬁned to a certain region of interest.

• The spectral shape of a possible signal is known.

• The spectral shape of the background is known1.

• The spectrum is divided into bins and the event numbers in the bins

follow Poisson distributions.

The analysis consists of two steps. First, the probability that the observed
spectrum is due to background only is calculated. If this probability is less
then an a priori deﬁned value, the discovery (or evidence) criterion, the signal
process is assumed to contribute to the spectrum and a discovery (or evidence)
is claimed. If the process is known to exist, this step is skipped. Based on
the outcome, in a second step the signal contribution is either estimated or an
upper limit for the signal contribution is calculated.

2.1 Hypothesis test

In the following, H denotes the hypothesis that the observed spectrum is due
to background only; the negation, interpreted here as the hypothesis that
the signal process contributes to the spectrum2, is labeled H. The conditional
probabilities for the hypotheses H and H to be true or not, given the measured
spectrum are labeled p(H|spectrum) and p(H|spectrum), respectively. They
obey the following relation:

p(H|spectrum) + p(H|spectrum) = 1 .

The conditional probabilities for H and H can be calculated using Bayes’

Theorem [2]:

p(H|spectrum) =

p(spectrum|H) · p0(H|I)
p(spectrum)

1This assumption and the previous can be removed in a straightforward way with the

introduction of additional prior densities.

2Since the shape of the background spectrum is assumed to be known the case of unknown
background sources contributing to the measured spectrum is ignored. However, the overall
level of background is allowed to vary.

and

p(H|spectrum) =

p(spectrum|H) · p0(H|I)
p(spectrum)

,

(3)

(5)

(6)

(7)

where p(spectrum|H) and p(spectrum|H) are the conditional probabilities to
ﬁnd the observed spectrum given that the hypothesis H is true or not true,
respectively and p0(H|I) and p0(H|I) are the prior probabilities for H and H.
The values of p0(H|I) and p0(H|I) are chosen depending on additional infor-
mation, I, such as existing knowledge from previous experiments and model
predictions. In the following, the symbol I is dropped but it should be under-
stood that all available information is used in the evaluation of probabilities.
The probability p(spectrum) is rewritten as

p(spectrum) = p(spectrum|H) · p0(H) + p(spectrum|H) · p0(H)

(4)

The probabilities p(spectrum|H) and p(spectrum|H) can be decomposed
in terms of the expected number of signal events, S, and the expected number
of background events, B:

p(spectrum|H) =

p(spectrum|B) · p0(B) dB,

p(spectrum|H) =

p(spectrum|S, B) · p0(S) · p0(B) dS dB,

Z

Z

where p(spectrum|B) and p(spectrum|S, B) are the conditional probabilities
to obtain the measured spectrum. Further, p0(S) and p0(B) are the prior prob-
abilities for the number of signal and background events, respectively. They
are assumed to be uncorrelated, and are chosen depending on the knowledge
from previous experiments, supporting measurements and models.

The observed number of events in the ith bin of the spectrum is denoted
ni. Assuming the ﬂuctuations in the bins of the spectrum to be uncorrelated
the probability to observe the measured spectrum, given B (in case H is true)
or the set S, B (in case H is true), is simply the product of the probabilities
to observe the N values, {ni}. The expected number of events in the ith bin,
λi, can be expressed in terms of S and B:

λi = λi(S, B)

= S ·

fS(E) dE + B ·

fB(E) dE,

Z∆Ei

Z∆Ei
where fS(E) and fB(E) are the normalized shapes of the known signal and
background spectra, respectively, and ∆Ei is the width of the ith bin. The
letter E suggests an energy bin, but the binning can be performed in any
quantity of interest. The number of events in each bin can ﬂuctuate around

3

λi according to a Poisson distribution. This yields

p(spectrum|B) =

e−λi(0, B)

p(spectrum|S, B) =

e−λi(S, B) .

with λi calculated according to (7). Evidence for a signal or a discovery can be
decided based on the resulting value for p(H|spectrum). It should be empha-
sized that the discovery criterion has to be chosen before the data is analyzed.
A value of p(H|spectrum) ≤ 0.0001 is proposed for the discovery criterion,
whereas a value of p(H|spectrum) ≤ 0.01 can be considered to give evidence
for H.

The analysis can be easily extended to include uncertainties in the knowl-
edge of relevant quantities. For example, if the spectrum is plotted as a func-
tion of energy, and the energy scale has an uncertainty, then equations (8,9)
can be rewritten as

p(spectrum|B) =

e−λi(0, B|k)

(12)

where λi(S, B|k) is the expected number of events for a given energy scale
factor k and p0(k) is the probability density for k (e.g., a Gaussian distribution
centered on k = 1).

2.2 Signal parameter estimate

In case the spectrum fulﬁlls the requirement of evidence or discovery, the
number of signal events can be estimated from the data. The probability
that the observed spectrum can be explained by the set of parameters S and
B, making again use of Bayes’ Theorem, is:

p(S, B|spectrum) =

p(spectrum|S, B) · p0(S) · p0(B)
p(spectrum|S, B) · p0(S) · p0(B) dS dB

.

(13)

R

In order to estimate the signal contribution the probability p(S, B|spectrum)

is marginalized with respect to B:

p(S|spectrum) =

p(S, B|spectrum) dB .

(14)

Z

The mode of this distribution, S∗, i.e., the value of S which maximizes
p(S|spectrum), can be used as an estimator for the signal contribution. The
standard uncertainty on S can be evaluated from

S16

0
Z

S84

0
Z

p(S|spectrum) dS = 0.16

p(S|spectrum) dS = 0.84

such that the results can be quoted as

S∗+(S84−S∗)
−(S∗−S16) .

(15)

2.3 Setting limits on the signal parameter

In case the requirement for an observation of the signal process is not fulﬁlled
an upper limit on the number of signal events is calculated. For example, a
90% probability lower limit is calculated by integrating Equation (14) to 90%
probability:

S90

0
Z

p(S|spectrum) dS = 0.90 .

(16)

S90 is the 90% probability upper limit on the number of signal events. It
should be noted that in this case it is assumed that H is true but the signal
process is too weak to signiﬁcantly contribute to the spectrum.

3 Making predictions - ensemble tests

In order to predict the outcome of an experiment distributions of the quantities
under study can be calculated. This is done numerically by generating possible
spectra and subsequently analyzing these. The spectra are typically generated
from Monte Carlo simulations of signal and background events. For a given
ensemble, the number of signal and background events, S0 and B0 are ﬁxed
and a random number of events are collected according to Poisson distributions
with means S0 and B0. From each ensemble a spectrum is extracted and the
analysis described above is applied. The analysis chain is shown in Figure 1.

5

The output parameters,

such as the conditional probability for H,
p(H|spectrum), are histogrammed and the frequency distribution is interpreted
as the probability density for the parameter under study. As examples, the
mean value and the 16% to 84% probability intervals can be deduced and used
to predict the outcome of the experiment. This approach is referred to as
ensemble tests.

Systematic uncertainties, such as the inﬂuence of energy resolution, miscal-
ibration or signal and background eﬃciencies, can be estimated by analyzing
ensembles which are generated under diﬀerent assumptions.

each ensemble a spectrum is extracted and subsequently analyzed. The prob-
ability p(H|spectrum) for each spectrum is depicted here as the outcome of
the analysis.

4 Sensitivity of the GERDA experiment

In the following, the GERDA experiment is introduced and the Bayesian
analysis method, developed in section 2, is applied on Monte Carlo data in
order to predict possible outcomes of the experiment.

4.1 Neutrinoless double beta decay and the GERDA ex-

periment

The GERmanium Detector Array, GERDA [1], is a new experiment to search
for neutrinoless double beta decay (0νββ) of the germanium isotope 76Ge.
Neutrinoless double beta decay is a second order weak process which is pre-
dicted to occur if the neutrino is a Majorana particle. The half-life of the

6

process is a function of the neutrino masses, their mixing angles, and the CP
phases. Today, 90% C.L. limits on the half-life for neutrinoless double beta
decay of 76Ge exist and come from the Heidelberg-Moscow [3] and IGEX [4]
experiments. They are T1/2 > 1.9 · 1025 years and T1/2 > 1.6 · 1025 years,
respectively. A positive claim was given by parts of the Heidelberg-Moscow
collaboration with a 3 σ range of T1/2 = (0.7 − 4.2) · 1025 years and a best value
of T1/2 = 1.2 · 1025 years [5].

A total exposure (measured in kg·years of operating the germanium diodes)
of at least 100 kg·years should be collected during the run-time of the GERDA
experiment. The germanium diodes are enriched in the isotope 76Ge to a level
of about 86%. One of the most ambitious goals of the experiment is the
envisioned background level of 10−3 counts/(kg·keV·y). This is two orders of
magnitude below the background index observed in previous experiments [3, 6].
For an exposure of 100 kg·years the expected number of background events in
the 100 keV wide region of interest is approximately 10. Using the present
best limit on the half-life less than 20 0νββ-events are expected within a much
smaller window. The number of expected 0νββ-events, S0, is correlated with
the half-life of the process via

S0 ≈ ln 2 · κ · M · ǫsig ·

NA
MA

·

t
T1/2

,

(17)

where κ = 0.86 is the enrichment factor, M is the mass of germanium in grams,
NA is Avogadro’s constant and t is the measuring time. MA is the atomic mass
and ǫsig is the signal eﬃciency, estimated from Monte Carlo data to be 87%.

4.2 Expected spectral shapes and prior probabilities

In GERDA, the energy spectrum in the region around 2 MeV is expected
to be populated by events from various background processes. The signature
of neutrinoless double beta decay, the signal process, is a sharp spectral line
at the Qββ-value which for the germanium isotope 76Ge is 2 039 keV. In the
following, the region of interest is deﬁned as an energy window of ±50 keV
around the Qββ-value. The shape of the background spectrum is assumed to
be ﬂat, i.e. fB(E) = const. The shape of the signal contribution is assumed to
be Gaussian with a mean value at the Qββ-value. The energy resolution of the
germanium detectors in the GERDA setup is expected to be 5 keV (FWHM),
corresponding to a width of the signal Gaussian of σ ≈ 2.1 keV.

For the calculation of the sensitivity, ensembles are generated according
to (1) the exposure, (2) the half-life of the 0νββ-process which is translated
into the number of expected signal events, S0, in the spectrum, and (2) the
background index in the region of interest which is translated into the number
of expected background events, B0. The number of signal and background
events in each ensemble ﬂuctuate around their expectation values S0 and B0
according to a Poisson distribution. For each set of input parameters 1000

7

ensembles are generated. An energy spectrum is extracted from each ensemble
with a bin size of 1 keV.

In order to calculate the probability that the spectrum is due to background
processes only, the prior probabilities for the hypothesis H and H have to be
ﬁxed, as well as those for the signal and background contributions. This is
a key step in the Bayesian analysis. Given the lack of theoretical consensus
on the Majorana nature of neutrinos and the cloudy experimental picture, the
prior probabilities for H and H are chosen to be equal, i.e.

p0(H) = 0.5,
p0(H) = 0.5 .

(18)
(19)

(20)

(21)

The prior probability for the number of expected signal events, assuming
H, is assumed ﬂat up to a maximum value, Smax, consistent with existing
limits3. It should be noted that the setting of the prior probability for H is
dependent on the maximum allowed signal rate. Smax was chosen in such a
way that the probability for the hypothesis H is reasonably assumed to be
50 %. The eﬀect of choosing a diﬀerent prior for the number of signal events
is discussed below.

The background contribution B is assumed to be known within some un-
certainty (recall that the shape of the background is however ﬁxed). The prior
probability for B is chosen to be Gaussian with mean value µB = B0 and width
σB = B0/2. The prior probabilities for the expected signal and background
contributions are

As an example, Figure 2 (top, left) shows a spectrum from Monte Carlo data
generated under the assumptions of a half-life of 2 · 1025 years, a background
index of 10−3 counts/(kg·keV·y) and an exposure of 100 kg·years. This cor-

tion is S∗ = 19.8, consistent with the number of signal events in the spectrum.
Figure 2 (bottom, left) shows the distribution of S∗ for 1000 ensembles gen-
erated under the same assumptions. The average number of S∗ = 20.3, in

a probability p(H|spectrum) of less than 0.01%. I.e., a discovery could not be
claimed for less than 3% of experiments under these conditions.

and an exposure of 100 kg·years. The signal events are indicated by a solid
line, the background events by a dashed line. The probability density for S
(top, right) peaks at 19.8 which is consistent with the number of signal events,
20, in the spectrum. The distribution of the estimated number of signal events
(bottom, left) as well as the distribution of the log p(H|spectrum) (bottom,

In order to simulate the case in which only lower limits on the half-life
of the 0νββ-process are set, ensembles are generated without signal contribu-
tion, i.e. S0 = 0. As an example, Fig. 3 (top, left) shows a spectrum from
Monte Carlo data generated under the assumptions of a background index of
10−3 counts/(kg·keV·y) and an exposure of 100 kg·years. No signal events are

4.4 Sensitivity

For the ensembles generated without signal contribution the mean of the 90%
probability lower limit on the half-life is shown in Figure 4 as a function
of the exposure for diﬀerent background indices.
In case no background is
present the limit scales linearly with the exposure. With increasing back-
ground contribution the limit on the half-life increases more slowly. For the
envisioned background index of 10−3 counts/(kg·keV·y) and an expected ex-
posure of 100 kg·years an average lower limit of T1/2 > 13.5 · 1025 years can be
set. For the same exposure, the average lower limit is T1/2 > 6.0 · 1025 years
and T1/2 > 18.5 · 1025 years for background indices of 10−2 counts/(kg·keV·y)
and 10−4 counts/(kg·keV·y), respectively.

Using the nuclear matrix elements quoted in [7] the lower limit on the half-
life of the 0νββ-process can be translated into an upper limit on the eﬀective
Majorana neutrino mass, hmββi, via

hmββi = (T1/2 · G0ν)−1/2 ·

1
hM 0νi

,

(22)

where G0ν is a phase space factor and hM 0νi is the nuclear matrix element.
Figure 4 also shows the expected 90% probability upper limit on the eﬀective
Majorana neutrino mass as a function of the exposure. With a background
index of 10−3 counts/(kg·keV·y) and an exposure of 100 kg·years, an upper
limit of hmββi < 200 meV could be set assuming no 0νββ-events are observed.

Figure 5 shows the half-life for which 50% of the experiments would re-
port a discovery of neutrinoless double beta decay as a function of the expo-
sure for diﬀerent background indices. For the envisioned background index of
10−3 counts/(kg·keV·y) and an expected exposure of 100 kg·years this half-life
is 5 · 1025 years.

Using the same matrix elements from reference [7], the half-life is trans-
formed into an eﬀective Majorana neutrino mass. The mass for which 50%
of the experiments would report a discovery is shown in Figure 5 (bottom)
as a function of the exposure and for diﬀerent background conditions. For an
exposure of 100 kg·years and a background index of 10−3 counts/(kg·keV·y)
neutrinoless double beta decay could be discovered for an eﬀective Majorana
neutrino mass of 350 meV (with a 50% probability).

Figure 4: The upper plot shows the expected 90% probability lower limit
on the half-life for neutrinoless double beta decay versus the exposure under
diﬀerent background conditions. Also shown is the half-life for the claimed
observation [5]. The lower plot shows the expected 90% probability upper limit
on the eﬀective Majorana neutrino mass versus the exposure under diﬀerent
background conditions. The eﬀective Majorana neutrino mass for the claimed
observation is also shown. All mass values were determined from the half-life
using the matrix element reported in [7].

Figure 5: Top: the half-life for which 50% of the experiments would report a
discovery, i.e. a probability that the spectrum is due to background processes
only, p(H|spectrum), of less than 0.01%, is plotted versus the exposure under
diﬀerent background conditions. Bottom: the eﬀective Majorana neutrino
mass for which 50% of the experiments would report a discovery versus the
exposure under diﬀerent background conditions. The mass was determined
from the half-life using the matrix element reported in [7].

Inﬂuence of the prior probabilities

In order to study the inﬂuence of the prior probabilities on the outcome of
the experiment, the prior probability for the number of expected signal events,
p0(S), was varied. Three diﬀerent prior probabilities were studied:

• ﬂat prior: p0(S) ∝ const. ,

• pessimistic prior: p0(S) ∝ e−S/10 ,

• peaking prior: p0(S) ∝ e1− ˜S/S/S2,

where ˜S is the number of events corresponding to a half-life of 1.2·1025 years
and S < Smax. For a background index of 10−3 counts/(kg keV y) and an ex-
posure of 100 kg years the limit strongly depends on the chosen prior. For the
pessimistic prior probability the limit which can be set on the half-life is about
10% higher than that for the ﬂat prior probability. In comparison, the peaking
prior gives a 50% lower limit compared to the ﬂat prior. This study makes
the role of priors clear. If an opinion is initially strongly held, then substantial
data is needed to change it. In the scientiﬁc context, consensus priors should
be strived for.

5 Conclusions

An analysis method, based on Bayes’ Theorem, was developed which can be
used to evaluate the probability that a spectrum can be explained by back-
ground processes alone, and thereby determine whether a signal process is
necessary. A criterion for claiming evidence for, or discovery of, a signal was
proposed. Monte Carlo techniques were described to make predictions about
the possible outcomes of the experiments and to evaluate the sensitivity for
the process under study.

As an example the method was applied to the case of the GERDA ex-
periment for which the sensitivity to neutrinoless double beta decay of 76Ge
was calculated. With a background index of 10−3 counts/(kg·keV·y) and an
exposure of 100 kg·years the sensitivity of the half-life of the 0νββ-process is
expected to be 13.5 · 1025 years.

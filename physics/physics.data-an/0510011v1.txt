Abstract

1/f α noises are ubiquitous and aﬀect many measurements. These noises are both
a nuisance and a peculiarity of several physical systems; in dielectrics, glasses and
networked liquids it is very common to study this noise to gather useful informa-
tion. Sometimes it happens that the noise has a power-law shape only in a certain
frequency range, and contains other important features, that are however diﬃcult
to study because simple ﬁts often fail. Here I propose a model-based ﬁt procedure
that performs well on spectra obtained in a molecular dynamics simulation.

1 Introduction

1/f α noises are very common and aﬀect many measurements; the literature
on this subject keeps growing and the apparent ubiquity of these noises has
always drawn a great deal of attention. In the experimental practice, they are
both a nuisance and a peculiarity of several physical systems; in dielectrics,
glasses and networked liquids it is very common to study these noises to gather
useful information [1,2,3,4]. Sometimes it happens that the noise has a power-
law shape only in a certain frequency range which spans several decades, and
at the same time contains other important features, that are however diﬃcult
to study because simple ﬁts often fail. The main reason of this failure is that
the prominent low-frequency peak biases the ﬁt so much that the minute and
mostly high-frequency features are neglected. Here I propose a model-based
ﬁt procedure that bypasses this problem and that performs well on spectra
obtained in a molecular dynamics simulation of water.

In the rest of this introduction I review the classic superposition argument
that relates power-law spectra to the single exponential relaxation processes;
in section 2 I analyze the properties of the autocorrelation function of 1/f α
spectra; in section 3 I consider the spectral behavior associated to some well-
deﬁned distributions of relaxation rates; ﬁnally in the last section I show the
results of a model-based ﬁt in the case of a molecular dynamics simulation of
liquid water, and I summarize my conclusions.

A mathematical mechanism for producing 1/f α noise was proposed long ago
by Bernamont [5], who observed that the superposition of many Lorentzian
spectra with a certain distribution of diﬀerent rates could produce a spec-
tral density with a 1/f region. The Bernamont superposition argument can
be made rigorous with a slight modiﬁcation of the standard proof of Camp-
bell’s theorem [6], and it goes as follows. Take a signal x(t) originated by the
linear superposition of many random pulses, i.e., pulses that are random in
time and can be described by a memoryless process with a Poisson distribu-
tion, have random amplitude A drawn from a distribution with ﬁnite variance
and probability density gA(A), and such that their pulse response function
h(t, λ) = exp(
λt) (if t > 0, otherwise h(t, λ) = 0) is drawn from a distri-
bution with probability density gλ(λ). The pulses are received and detected
with a rate n(A, λ) which in general depends both on the amplitude A and on
the decay rate λ. The pulse arrival process is Poissonian and thus one detects
on average [n(A, λ)dAdλ] dt pulses in the time interval (t′, t′ + dt) (and in the
amplitude-λ range dAdλ); for the same reason the variance of the number of
detected pulses is also equal to [n(A, λ)dAdλ] dt. This means that the mean
square ﬂuctuation of the output signal at time t is given by the integral

2 The rate distribution from the correlation function

We see that from a given rate distribution we obtain a certain spectral density:
can we do the reverse and obtain the rate distribution from a given spectral
density? This is not obvious because the spectral density is only a second-
order statistics, and does not contain phase information (nor is it possible to
preserve it for a noise process). However the answer is yes, the rate distribution
can be recovered from the spectral density. This can easily be seen from the
formal Taylor expansion of the denominator in the integral (5):

This expansion is only formal inasmuch as it does not converge everywhere,
however it shows unequivocally that the shape of S(ω) depends only on the
even moments about the origin of the probability density gλ. A probability
density function is uniquely determined by the knowledge of all the moments
λn
(see, e.g., [7]), and the even moments alone are not enough, but we could
h
still do without the odd moments if the probability density function were an
even function. This is not so, because the decay rates λ must be non-negative,
and thus the associated probability density function does not have any deﬁ-
nite parity. However a probability density function which is non-zero only for
positive values of the decay rates can be written in a unique way as the sum of
an even and an odd function gλ(λ) = g(odd)
(λ) =

The previous result is only formal and does not yield a practical inversion
formula; the actual inversion can be performed in the time domain when we
recall that the spectral density S(ω) is related to the correlation function R(τ )

then we see from equation (13) that the correlation function is also the Laplace
transform of gλ(λ)/(2λ), and the rate distribution function is uniquely deter-
mined by the spectral density and can be retrieved by means of a numerical
inverse Laplace transform. In practice, rather than a numerical evaluation of
the inverse Laplace transform, one is forced to ﬁt a discrete set of decaying
exponentials, and moreover from the correspondence between the Bromwich
inversion integral and the inverse Fourier transform, and from the sampling
theorem, we see that we must sample the time correlation function, and there-
fore the noise signal, at a frequency at least twice as high as λmax to retrieve
gλ. Notice that because of the λ in the denominator of the integrand in (13),
the slow relaxations are more heavily weighted in the integral, and the high-
frequency parts of the decay rate distribution are much harder to recover
than the low-frequency parts; this makes even harder an inversion task which
is already known to be very diﬃcult [8].

The mixtures of decaying exponentials that characterize many experimental
measurements diﬀer signiﬁcantly only at very short times, while for longer
times all the exponentials are equally buried in noise. Disentangling the mix-
ture and ﬁnding the relative weights of the diﬀerent components is possible
only if sampling times are very closely spaced at the beginning (and one com-
mon strategy is to use logarithmically spaced sampling times (see, e.g. [9]))
and only if one includes some form of prior or assumed knowledge of the dis-
tribution of decay rates. There are very few well-established procedures to do
this, and the best known are the programs CONTIN and UPEN. CONTIN
[10] uses the following strategies: a) it takes into account absolute prior knowl-
edge, i.e. whichever exact information that may be available at the beginning,
like the non-negativity of decay rates; b) it assumes some statistical prior
knowledge as well, which is essentially the knowledge of the statistics of the
measurement noise; c) it uses a principle of parsimony, which is similar to the
principle of maximum entropy, though not as well deﬁned. UPEN (Uniform

5

PENalty) [11] assumes instead a priori that the distribution of decay rates is a
continuous function and penalizes distributions which are either discontinuous
or have wildly varying curvature.

In addition to constraints on the shape of the distribution function it is com-
mon to use some well-deﬁned standard functions that appear to ﬁt very well
many sets of experimental data; the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts function de-
scribes stretched exponentials and works well for relaxations in the time do-
main and similarly the Havrilijak-Negami (HN) function provides good ﬁts
to spectral data. These empirical functions are well-known, and in particular
from the HN spectral shape it is possible to compute analytically the distribu-
tion of relaxation rates [12]. However, even though these functions often give
satisfactory ﬁts, it would be much better to connect data from experiments or
numerical simulations to some well-deﬁned, simple distribution of relaxation
rates, just like the spectral density in equation (6) can be directly related to
a ﬂat distribution of relaxation rates: in the following section I give a list of
such spectral shapes.

3 A gallery of spectral densities

The spectral density in equation (6) produces an intermediate region with
a 1/f behavior, and includes both a minimum and a maximum relaxation
rate: at a frequency lower than the minimum relaxation rate the spectral
density whitens and becomes nearly ﬂat, while at a frequency higher than the
maximum relaxation rate the spectral density bends downward and assumes a
1/f 2 behavior, and for ﬁtting purposes we deﬁne the standard spectral density

(14)

However either the minimum or the maximum relaxation rate (or both) may
be out of the experimental or numerical simulation range: in these cases the
bends at low- and high-frequency become invisible, and a ﬁt with the spectral
density (14) is unstable (at least one of the range parameters is invisible and
the chi-square hypersurface ﬂattens out in that direction, adversely inﬂuencing
the ﬁt). This can be corrected using the modiﬁed spectral density

We have already given a simple argument that shows that a nonuniform dis-
λ−β between the maximum and
tribution of relaxation processes like gλ ∝
minimum relaxation rates λmin, λmax, produces a spectral density with an
intermediate 1/f 1+β region: an exact integration yields the spectral density

but I shall not consider them here, since these shapes seem to be far less

The integral (5) is a sum of functions that decrease for positive, increasing ω
and therefore cannot be an increasing function and therefore no distribution
of relaxation rates can possibly describe bumps and other small local features
such as those that are observed in the spectral densities of glassy systems.
These features can be described by resonances or by groups of close resonances;
the simplest choices are a) ﬁxed resonance frequency and ﬂat distribution of
relaxation rates; b) ﬁxed relaxation rate and ﬂat distribution of resonance
frequencies. In the case of a ﬂat distribution of relaxation rates between the
maximum and minimum rates λmin, λmax we ﬁnd

4 Model-based ﬁt of a simulated spectral density

When ﬁtting spectra it is important to include the variance of spectral data: if
Sk is the spectral estimate at the k-th frequency, and if the time-domain data
are aﬀected by Gaussian white noise, then the spectral estimate of the white
noise background has standard deviation Sk [13]; this estimate of the standard
deviation is usually assumed for simplicity even when there are deterministic
components or the noise is not white. Moreover if the ﬁnal spectral density
is the average of M uncorrelated spectra, then the estimate of the standard
deviation at the k-th frequency is Sk/√M . I wish to stress that this treatment
of the spectral variance is only approximate in the case of colored noises,
but it is assumed nonetheless, because of the complexity of a calculation that
includes the correlation between diﬀerent samples in the time domain (see,
e.g. [14]).

I have tested the simple model-derived spectral densities described in section
3 on data kindly provided by C. Chakravarty and A. Mudi [15]: the original
spectral data are shown in ﬁgure 10 and correspond to the 230 K curve in ﬁg-
ure 1a of reference [16] (see also [17,18,19] for full simulation details). At very
low frequency the spectrum is rather steep: a simple ﬁt of the low-frequency
data shows a 1/f 2 behavior, and thus we can surmise that this is just the
high-frequency tail of a simple relaxation with a very low relaxation constant
(this accounts for 2 ﬁt parameters: amplitude and relaxation rate). At higher
frequency the slope is smaller and Mudi and Chakravarty estimate a spectral
index slightly higher than 1 [16]: since there is no hint of a downward bend,
I exclude the full spectral shape (18) and also the reduced form (22), and I
choose (19) instead, i.e. I include the possibility of a low-frequency ﬂattening,
made invisible by the high-frequency tail of the simple relaxation (this adds
three more parameters to the ﬁt: an amplitude, a minimum relaxation rate,
and a spectral index β). The high-frequency bump resembles rather closely

12

Fig. 10. Spectral data from [16] (230 K data in ﬁgure 1a): mean square ﬂuctuation
of potential energy vs. frequency. The overall shape is close to a 1/f α spectrum,
but notice the low-frequency steepening of the spectrum and the pair of bumps: the
low-frequency steepening can be associated to a strong single relaxation, while the
bumps should correspond to two resonance distributions like those in equation (26).

the shape in ﬁgure 9, and thus it is reasonable to assume that both the low-
frequency and the high-frequency bumps correspond to ﬂat superpositions of
resonances like in equation (26) (each bump accounts for 4 more parameters:
an amplitude, a relaxation rate, a minimum and a maximum resonance fre-
quency, but the relaxation rate is taken to be the same in both bumps). The
resulting 12 parameter model is:

4Sfw(ω; ωmin,4, ωmax,4, λ34)

(27)

Notice that the assumptions on the relaxation rate distributions help keep the
number of ﬁt parameters rather low. If we tried to ﬁt with a superposition
of N simple relaxations we would have 2N parameters (one amplitude plus
one relaxation rate for each relaxation component): with 12 parameters we
could ﬁt only 6 simple relaxation components, therefore the assumed shapes
(that correspond to given distributions of relaxation rates and resonance fre-
quencies) allow for a much more economical ﬁt procedure. In this case the
spectral data are averages of M = 448 spectra; table 1 lists the ﬁt parameters
to the data [15] obtained with a standard Levenberg-Marquardt chi-square
minimization procedure, and ﬁgure 11 compares the ﬁt with the data (the a
amplitude values in the table are in the spectral amplitude units of ﬁg. 10,
the λ’s and the ω’s are in cm−1, and β is dimensionless).

The model (27) is a function of both relaxation rate and resonance frequency
and should thus be described by a two-parameter distribution g(λ, ω0) rather
than gλ(λ), however if we concentrate on the projection on the λ axis, then we
can consider only the ﬁrst two terms: the (reduced) λ distribution is shown in

The data are shown in light gray in the background; the dotted curves a, b, c, and
d represent respectively the ﬁrst, second, third and fourth term of the model (27).

distribution. Notice that such a distribution is quite challenging for other ﬁt
methods, like those implemented by CONTIN and UPEN.

5 Conclusion

In this paper I have described a model-based ﬁt of power-law-like spectral
densities. Like other similar methods, it embodies a priori information on the
shape of the distribution, but unlike the other methods, the shape is physically
motivated, and the ﬁts can be eﬃciently performed with a reduced number of
parameters.

Abstract

Novel String Banana Template Method (SBTM) for track reconstruction in high multiplicity
events in non-uniform magnetic ﬁeld spectrometer with emphasis on the lowest momenta tracks
with signiﬁcant Multiple Scattering (MS) is described. Two steps model of track with additional
parameter/s which takes into account MS for this particular track is introduced. SBTM is
time eﬃcient and demonstrates better resolutions than another method equivalent to the Least
Squares method (LSM).

1 SBTM description

Detailed Monte Carlo (MC) simulations (using GEANT [1], for example) could provide database of
track’s characteristics (templates) for later fast use.

The MS cone (as on Fig. 1a)) for an ensemble of particles with the same vector momentum ~P has
a signiﬁcant width (volume) at low momenta. At ﬁtting stage in high multiplicity event it results in
heavy computation with covariance matrices [2]. For pattern recognition in such diﬃcult cases it’s
crucial to have narrow Search Windows (SW) what requires an a priori knowledge of momentum.

It was found [3] that for another ensembles SWs are more narrow. The main idea of SBTM is in
use of ensembles with 3 ﬁxed points. Where the ﬁrst point is initial vertex V0. As two other points
two strips (pixels) i, j in two reference planes (RP) close to the middle and end of the track are used.
It results in 2-dimensional {i, j} templates (see Fig. 1b)). For such ensemble which geometrical
image in magnetic ﬁeld has a Banana-like shape all necessary characteristics (centre of Bananas,
their widths, angles, lengths ... ) could be saved a priori to track reconstruction.

Two steps model of track is used: the ﬁrst one – averaged over ensemble, gives rough estimations
for SW (Banana center and width) and momentum of candidate. The second – per event dependent
(takes into account MS for this particular track), permits to localize track in more narrow String
SW and provides track parameters corrections depending on relative deﬂection of a String inside a
Banana window. So SBTM uses more parameters in its model space than usually and it provides
additional corrections to track’ parameters.

At ﬁrst track recognition stage one check diﬀerent combinations of (i, j) signals in RPs and
select such which has proper number of signals inside of Banana road. At the second stage relative
positions of signals inside Banana are checked and if they are inside of a more narrow window
String – track candidate is recognized.

2 Comparison to another method and Conclusions

For demonstration and comparison the SBTM method is applied for the toy model spectrometer as
in [4]. In this article optimal track ﬁtting (OTF) which reproduces the results of the global ﬁt [5] is
described. Toy model spectrometer consists of four high resolution (5 µm) silicon detectors followed
by thirteen gas detectors (200 µm resolution) in 1T magnetic ﬁeld.

Main track reconstruction characteristics for this method and for OTF are shown on Fig.
2.
Points for OTF were taken from Fig. 10,11,12 in [4]. Fig. 2d) shows how close is track model to the
actual hits.

This global method has internal robustness and can easily work with ambiguous measurements
of diﬀerent detectors. It exploits simple and fast access model of track and is time eﬃcient. Its
template based nature and close approach to the actual hits make it attractive for implementation
in ﬁrmware.

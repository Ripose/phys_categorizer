Abstract
Clustering is a central concept in network theory. Nevertheless, its usual formulation as
the clustering coeﬃcient has serious limitations. We review the issue, pointing out well
studied networks where the coeﬃcient is insuﬃcient in the task of describing their local
topology. Motivated by this, we present an extension, the clustering proﬁle, following with
three applications that illustrate the relevance of this more complete and robust measure of
clustering. It gives us a fresh perspective of networks that have been extensively studied,
shedding new light on the small-world eﬀect and providing means to compare diﬀerent
mechanisms of cluster formation. We stress its use to better diﬀerentiate and understand
network growth processes, in particular to provide stringent constraints on theoretical
growth models.

Physicists have been greatly interested in studying the interplay between the
topology and growth dynamics of complex networks, for they are a universal frame-
work to understand various processes in previously unexplored areas ranging from
cell metabolism to linguistics. The unusual nature of their structure, represented by
graphs, required the development of novel methods and, perhaps, a new branch of
statistical physics, of which one of the core diﬃculties has been to understand what
measurements are robust and indeed represent universal quantities by which we can
compare and classify networks, or assert how eﬀectively a network growth model
reﬂects the network it tries to mimic.

Average distance, degree distribution, degree correlations, and the clustering co-
eﬃcient are some quantities which have established themselves as useful[1], but of
these, only the latter is a local quantity, measuring how many of your neighbors are
also neighbors themselves. Local structure is not only an important topological char-
acteristic, but also a main concern when studying searchability[2] and dynamics[3]
on a network.

But important as it is, the clustering coeﬃcient has serious limitations. We ﬁrst
focus on these shortcomings, as understanding them will enable us to propose an
improvement which allows a better characterization of a network’s local topology,
leading to many applications, one of which is the ability to diﬀerentiate network
growth processes that remained indistinguishable by the usual clustering coeﬃcient.
Since its introduction[4], the clustering coeﬃcient has been deﬁned as the ratio of
connected pairs among the neighbors of a vertex, averaged either over all vertices or
all pairs of neighbors. These two seemingly close deﬁnitions might yield very diﬀerent
results[5], as can be seen from the fact that the individual ratio for vertices of high
degree has greater impact on the latter case. Both deﬁnitions are useful though, and
can indeed be treated as equal in speciﬁc cases, but this ambiguity has often been
overlooked.

Later, a better description of clustering has been adopted by considering the coef-
ﬁcient as a function of vertex degree, as doing so reveals important structural features
such as hierarchical organization[6], and — something seldom noted — removes the
ambiguity of the former deﬁnition. Moreover, other deﬁnitions have become neces-
sary as in the case of bipartite networks, crucial for the study of the dynamics of
sexually transmitted diseases[7], where no odd-cycles exist and thus the clustering
coeﬃcient is always zero, even though a bipartite network may have a very dense
local structure.

All this is evidence that a general treatment of clustering cannot expect to rest
on a simple scalar quantity; however, it should remain a local property that can be
calculated for each vertex. Thus the source of the problem seems to be the question
asked, of “how many of my neighbors are connected?”, instead of “how closely related
are my neighbors?”, which we think better comprehends the concept of clustering as

FIG. 1: The clustering proﬁle C d(v): the fraction of pairs of neighbors whose smallest cycle
shared with the vertex has length d. In the example above, v has 10 pairs of neighbors and
a non-zero proﬁle for d = 1, 2. C 1(v) is, by deﬁnition, the usual clustering coeﬃcient.

a measure of local topology.

In order to implement this idea we turn back to the original deﬁnition of clustering
for a vertex, the fraction of connected pairs among its neighbors, and notice that
“connected” can stand for “whose distance is 1”. Then the usual clustering coeﬃcient
can be understood as the ﬁrst term of a sequence, the term accounting for the fraction
of pairs of neighbors whose distance is 1. The second term would be the fraction of
pairs of neighbors whose distance is 2, and so on. Now, since those are all neighbors
of the same vertex, they are always connected by a path of length 2 going through
that vertex, and so we must discard paths going through the vertex in question when
calculating this distance between its neighbors.

This can, perhaps, be more clearly understood in terms of cycles: the nth term of
the sequence would correspond to the fraction of pairs of neighbors whose smallest
cycle shared with the given vertex has length n + 2; as can be seen on FIG. 1.

It is this sequence over distance which we will deﬁne as the clustering proﬁle for a
vertex. Each term stands for the fraction of pairs of neighbors whose distance is d if
you disregard paths through the vertex. We therefore proceed to a formal deﬁnition.
In a network G composed of vertices V and edges E, so that G = (V, E), we
denote the clustering proﬁle for a vertex u ∈ V as C d(u), and deﬁne it as the number
of pairs of neighbors of u whose distance in the induced network G(V \ {u}) is d,
divided by the total number of pairs of neighbors of u, thus

3

C d(u) =

|{{v, w}; v, w ∈ N(u)|dG\{u}(v, w) = d}|
|N (u)|

,

(cid:16)

where N(ν) is the set of neighbors of the vertex ν, the modulus | · | represents
the cardinality (number of elements) of a set, and so |N(ν)| is the degree of ν, also
denoted δ(ν).

This leads to a generalized description of how the network is organized around
that vertex, reﬂecting the contribution of more distant neighbors in higher terms,
while still preserving the good property that, when summed over all terms, it ranges
between 0 and 1.

We can then deﬁne the clustering proﬁle for a network as a function of degree,

being the average of C d(u) over all vertices of same degree k, and denote it

(1)

(2)

k = P{u|δ(u)=k} C d(u)
C d
|{u|δ(u) = k}|

.

It should be noticed that the usual clustering coeﬃcient as a function of degree
is simply C 1
k . And though calculating numerically the clustering proﬁle is more
expensive a computer operation than calculating the usual coeﬃcient, each step
of the calculation is parallelizable and so even large networks can be treated with
relatively small computer resources.

We here provide three examples of applications of the clustering proﬁle involving
digital, social and biological networks. It is interesting to notice that in each case a
diﬀerent aspect of the proﬁle is relevant to the conclusions.

FIG. 2 shows the clustering proﬁle for the actors network. Based on the coeﬃcient
alone (d = 1), one could suggest that higher degree actors live in a much less clustered
world. The proﬁle makes it clear that the clustering only migrates from distance one

remarkably close to 1.0 for all k, which implies that almost every two neighbors of a
vertex share a cycle of length 4 or less with it.

In addition, the sum of C d

On FIG. 3 we present the proﬁle for the metabolic network of bacteria studied
in reference [6], where a growth model is also provided to explain its hierarchical
organization. The graphic portrays, for ﬁxed distances, the proﬁle’s variation with
degree in dilog scale. We note that, other than the usual clustering coeﬃcient C 1
k,
all additional terms diﬀer sharply from the behavior of the network-growth model
presented in the reference. In more detail, this plot shows that for all d, C d
k varies
as a power law in k, indicating a deeper hierarchical structure, while for the model
it can be shown[16] that, almost-everywhere in k, it decreases as a rational function
of k for d = 2 and is constantly zero for d > 2.

FIG. 2: The well studied actors network has a richer local topology than one can see with
the usual clustering coeﬃcient, since C 1
k decreases quickly (d = 1) with degree, while deeper
measures (d = 2, 3) reveal the structure present even in high degrees.

FIG. 3: In a dilog scale (and smoothed for visualization), we see the metabolic network
has a wide range with power-law behavior even for higher distances. The small box shows
the same graph without scaling for comparison with the actors network.

While clearly in this case the model was crafted only to exemplify the hierarchical
characteristic of the network, we have been able to spot an important feature of the
local topology of the network that was missing from it, which would be relevant if
considering models to study ﬂow-dynamics in bacteria metabolism, for example.

In the detail box of FIG. 3, where the proﬁle is plotted without scaling, we see
another interesting feature of this network. As opposed to the actors network, ver-
tices with higher degrees do live in a much less clustered world, since even the sum
over all distances of the clustering proﬁle quickly approach zero as degree raises.

So, although both networks are small-world networks in the sense that they have
small average distance and high usual clustering coeﬃcient, our observations with
the clustering proﬁle sets them clearly apart: there are networks, such as the actors
network, where almost every vertex experiences, in a generalized sense, the small
world phenomena, while on other networks, such as the metabolic network, this
eﬀect is restricted to vertices of very low degree.

This is not only evidence of very diﬀerent network-growth processes, but we note
that this distinction reﬂects a strikingly diﬀerent local topology around the high
degree vertices, also called “hubs” in the literature, which play a central role in many
dynamical processes, notably in disease spreading[8] and information retrieval[9].
Therefore, clarifying this distinction is an important step towards a more structured
understanding of both the growth of, and the dynamics on, small-world networks.

From the arguments above, it is useful to deﬁne “complete-small-world networks”
as those networks where, for all degrees, the sum of the clustering proﬁle up to a
distance of the order of the network’s diameter is close to 1. This is also equivalent,
as we noted for the actors network, of requiring that all vertices in a complete-small-
world network share short cycles with all of their pairs of neighbors — a deﬁnition
some may ﬁnd more intuitive.

Finally, FIG. 4 displays a comparison of the above networks plus the World Wide
Web[10], but viewing the proﬁle as a function of distance, averaged over all vertices.
Both the web and the actors network have a simple exponential behavior, while
the metabolic network ﬁts to exp(−αd2). This is quite surprising, since the web
and metabolic are both free-scale dissortative[11] hierarchical[12] networks, while
the actors network, being assortative, has very little in common with the WWW.
As these discrepancies cannot be explained by the usual characteristics alone, they
stand as evidence for a new structural feature of complex networks.

This variation of the proﬁle with distance, being independent of current structural
measures, provides a new insight into the underlying dynamics leading to clusteriza-
tion by focusing on the depth of clustering, with which it might be possible to evaluate
or improve the various network growth models which use community structure[13],
edge addition bias[14, 15] and other strategies to explain the diﬀerent mechanisms
of clustering formation found in natural, social and technological networks.

FIG. 4: A diﬀerent view of the clustering proﬁle, averaged over all vertices to visualize its
variation with distance. The metabolic network shows a curious exp(−αd2) behavior, unlike
both the WWW and actors, which have close behavior but diﬀerent degree assortativity
properties.

In this paper we reviewed several issues and limitations of the usual clustering
coeﬃcient, a measure for clustering which is a pivot concept in the ﬁeld of com-
plex networks. We then presented a natural and comprehensive extension which
removes these limitations, showing both conceptually and by applications that this
generalization, called the clustering proﬁle, directly allows deeper and new insights
into networks well studied in the literature. Throughout these applications, we have
pointed how the clustering proﬁle may be used to better distinguish and understand
network growth processes and other phenomena related to their local structure, such
as the emergence of clustering in networks and the small-world eﬀect.
It is also
very suggestive, but still open, that having a more complete description of the local
topology of networks will have a major role in understanding the interaction between
network topology and dynamics on the network.

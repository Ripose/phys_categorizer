Abstract. An adaptive kernel method in the Bayesian framework together with a
new simulation program for Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS) have
been applied to the analysis of RBS data. Even in the case of strongly overlapping
RBS peaks a depth proﬁle reconstruction without noise ﬁtting has been achieved.
The adaptive kernel method leads to the simplest depth proﬁle consistent with
the data. Erosion and redeposition rates of carbon divertor plates in the fusion
experiment ASDEX Upgrade could be determined by RBS-analysis of thin ﬁlm
probes before and after exposition to plasma discharges.

1. Introduction

Rutherford backscattering is one of the most important and most commonly ap-
plied techniques in surface analysis. Its main advantages are that it is fully quan-
titative and that precisions less than 1% can be achieved [1]. The interpretation
of the data, however, is in many cases not straightforward. During the last decade
several computer programs for the simulation and analysis of spectra obtained
from RBS were developed, such as RUMP [2] or SIMNRA [3]. With these pro-
grams the determination of a depth proﬁle is, however, a matter of trial and error.
The user has to prescribe depth proﬁles of all elements and has to compare the
simulated spectrum calculated from the input proﬁles with the data. The depth
proﬁles are then adjusted until one obtains a reasonable agreement of simulated
and measured data. Obviously this evaluation procedure has several shortcomings.
It is a time-consuming cumbersome task, the accuracy of the achieved depth pro-
ﬁle is unknown and in many cases there is an ambiguity between diﬀerent depth
proﬁles which ﬁt the data equally well. The combination of the adaptive kernel
method in the Bayesian framework [4] with an RBS-simulation program allows to
overcome these disadvantages and extends the potential of Rutherford backscat-
tering spectroscopy.

2. Basic Concepts of Rutherford Backscattering

In RBS-analysis, a sample is exposed to a beam of ions with mass m0 (e.g. He-
particles) with a well deﬁned energy E0 in the order of MeV. Ions undergoing
elastic Coulomb collisions with sample atoms are recorded in a solid state detector
which views at a ﬁxed deﬂection angle θ. The Rutherford cross-section for this
coulombic projectile-target interaction is quantitatively known. The energy E′ of
the backscattered ions depends on the energy E before the collision, the mass of
the ions m0, the mass of their colliding partner Mi and the deﬂection angle θ :

From Eq. 1 we see that ions undergoing a collision with a heavy target atom loose
less energy than ions colliding with a target atom of lower atomic mass. In addition,
both primary ions and scattered ions loose energy on their way through the sample,
depending on the stopping power. This is the main reason which enables RBS to
be depth sensitive. The stopping power depends on the energy of the particles and
the composition of the sample.

from B produces a broadened step at lower energies. The high energy side of this
step originates from scattering from the topmost B-Layer. The increase of the
spectrum with decreasing energy results mainly from the 1
E2 dependence of the
Rutherford cross section.

3. Simulation of RBS-Spectra

For a spectrum synthesis the sample is divided into sub-layers with thickness
∆x. The spectrum is calculated from the superimposed contributions of scattering
processes from all elements in all sub-layers of the sample. For each sub-layer
the concentrations on the layer-boundaries must be given. Inside the sub-layer
the concentration proﬁle is assumed to interpolate linearly. In each sub-layer the
energy loss of the ions inside this layer and the cross-sections are determined.

Cross-Section Data: The actual cross-section deviates from the well known
Rutherford cross-section [5] at both, high and low energies. The low-energy dis-
crepancy is caused by partial screening of the nuclear charges by the electronic
shells [5]. This screening is taken into account by a correction factor C(E, Θ) [6].
At high energies the cross sections deviate from the Rutherford cross-section due
to the inﬂuence of the nuclear force [7]. This is unimportant in the present case.

Stopping Power Data: The two dominant processes of energy loss of a pene-
trating ion are the interactions of the moving ion with bound or free electrons
in the target, and the interactions of the moving ion with the screened or un-
screened nuclei of the target atoms. The electronic stopping power data are taken
from Ziegler, Biersack and Littmark [8]. The nuclear stopping power for helium is
calculated from [8]. In compound materials, Bragg’s rule is used,

the stopping power
Bragg’s rule that the interaction between the ion and a target atom is independent
(cid:1)
of the environment holds in most cases. In some compounds such as oxides the
deviations from Bragg’s rule predictions may, however, be of the order of 10% to
20% [9].

(cid:0)

Energy Loss Straggling: The energy loss of charged particles penetrating material
is accompanied by a spread of the beam energy which is due to statistical ﬂuctu-
ations of the energy transfer in the loss channels. As the number of interactions
is high, the energy broadening is well described by a Gaussian. The program uses
Bohr’s theory of energy-loss straggling [10], together with corrections by Chu [11],
which include the electron binding in the target atoms. The energy dependence of
the stopping power results further in a non-stochastic broadening (or squeezing)

the sub-layer is given by [12]:

with Ei, Ef as the mean energies and S(Ei), S(Ef ) as the stopping powers at the
entrance and exit of the sub-layer, respectively.

4. Experiment

The interpretation of RBS data is required for the analysis of erosion measurements
of plasma facing materials in fusion experiments. The solid inner walls surrounding
the plasma are subjected to an intense bombardment by plasma particles because
the conﬁnement of the plasma by the conﬁning magnetic ﬁeld is not perfect. The
surfaces of the inner walls are mainly modiﬁed by ion implantation, erosion and
by deposition of material from other wall areas.
One major problem in fusion research is to ﬁnd a wall material where wall ero-
sion rate and wall modiﬁcations are small and tolerable [13]. The importance of
this problem for planned fusion power plants is emphasized by an erosion anal-
ysis for ITER [14]. The modeled gross erosion yield of a carbon-divertor could
reach a maximum of 5m/burning-year, which is reduced by redeposition down
to about 0.5m/burning-year. The modeling, however, faces exceptional diﬃculties
due to complex hydrocarbon transport phenomena and the lack of input data (e.g.
for low energy sputtering). Therefore experimental determination of erosion and
redeposition yields is necessary to validate the modeling and to improve the quan-
titative knowledge of the fundamental erosion processes.
To determine carbon erosion rates in the divertor of ASDEX Upgrade, graphite
probes which were covered with a 150nm layer of 13C were exposed to single plasma
discharges. 13C was used because chemical erosion is unaﬀected by isotope substi-
tution and to allow the measurement of redeposited 12C eroded at other plasma
facing components. Furthermore the stopping power in 13C and 12C is the same
and so the limited accuracy of the stopping power in the simulation cancels. The
sample was introduced in the outer divertor of ASDEX Upgrade (circle in Fig. 2)
covering in particular the strike point, which is the point where the outermost last
closed magnetic ﬂux line touches the plate surface with a corresponding maximum
of the power load.
The samples were analyzed before and after plasma exposure with a total exposure
time of 4 seconds using RBS with 2.0 MeV 4He ions. The backscattered particles
were detected at a scattering angle of Θ = 165◦. The width of the apparatus trans-
fer function is about 19keV FWHM [15]. Fig. 3 shows typical spectra before and
after plasma exposure. Before plasma exposure the signal from the 13C-layer at
higher energy is separated by a gap from the part of the spectrum corresponding to
the underlying 12C-bulk material. After plasma exposure the high energy edge of
the signal from 13C has shifted towards lower energies. This indicates that there is
no longer 13C at the surface of the sample. The peak at 430 keV is due to the 12C
at the sample surface and from the 13C fraction below the surface. The diﬀerence

5. Results

To determine the concentration depth proﬁles from the measured RBS data a
simple χ2-ﬁt is insuﬃcient and results in useless rapidly oscillating depth proﬁles.
This is due to the ill-conditioned nature of the inversion problem which results from
the energy-straggling broadening, the ﬁnite apparatus-induced energy resolution
and the counting statistics. Furthermore the optimal grid, given by the thickness
of the sub-layers the sample is divided in, is unknown.
For this kind of problems the adaptive kernel method is well suited. The concept of
adaptive kernels provides local smoothness which makes the result robust against
noise corruption. The locality of the information content of the data is taken into
consideration by the local varying kernel widths. Constraints like positivity or
other prior knowledge (like bulk concentrations) are easy to include. The used
adaptive kernel method is presented in detail in this proceeding [16].

concentration of 13C (on the left side) is above 90% and decreases only slightly
to a depth of about 150nm. The remaining 10% fraction of 12C is caused by
impurities in the coating process. The broad transition between the 13C−layer and
the 12C−bulk can be explained by the interface roughness of the virgin sample.

DEPTH PROFILE RECONSTRUCTION FROM RBS-DATA

After 4 seconds of plasma exposure the depth proﬁles have changed dramatically,
as shown in Fig. 4b. There is a 12C−layer with a thickness of about 70nm on top of
the 13C. The maximum concentration of 13C has decreased, however, the thickness
of the 13C-layer is with about 170nm nearly unchanged. Furthermore, there is a
continuous level of 12C in the whole sample with a minimum concentration of 20%.
Since diﬀusion due to thermal eﬀects could be excluded, the impacting 12C-atoms
must have mixed the material. Fig. 4c shows the RBS-data as black dots and the
calculated RBS-spectrum (solid line) based on the depth proﬁle shown in Fig. 4b.
The agreement is within the counting statistics.
With samples in diﬀerent distances to the strike point we achieved a laterally
resolved determination of erosion and deposition as shown in Fig. 5. The height of
the 13C-tracer was 153nm before exposure (dashed line in Fig. 5). The grey shaded

erosion of 40nm was observed at the strike point. With increasing distance the
erosion reduces slightly to ≃ 30nm in 5cm distance. The solid line represents the
joint height of the 13C and deposited 12C under the assumption that no 12C from
the bulk was eroded. The diﬀerence between the solid line and the grey shaded
area of 13C is the height of deposited 12C. The amount of 12C which covers the
13C is largest at the strike point with over 100nm and reduces down to 10nm
in a distance of 5.5cm. Near the strike point the redeposition of carbon is larger
than the erosion, which makes this location a net deposition zone. By contrast,
in a distance larger than 1.5cm from the strike point there is a net erosion area.

Fig. 5 is only a schematic representation which shows the total amount of 12C
and 13C in a simpliﬁed distribution. It can be seen from the depth proﬁles in
Fig. 4 that after plasma exposure there are no longer clearly separated layers of
the two diﬀerent isotopes and pronounced mixing has occurred. The large spatial
variation of erosion and deposition rates shows, that the lifetime of plasma facing
components can only be evaluated for speciﬁc local conditions.

6. Conclusions

With the used combination of the RBS-simulation program and the adaptive kernel
method the capabilities of RBS-data evaluation have been considerably extended.
This allows to study erosion, deposition and mixing of carbon as inner wall material
in fusion experiments by using diﬀerent isotopes which have no inﬂuence on the
chemical erosion. The experiment shows a spatially varying net erosion/deposition
rate with large mixing. Further investigations are necessary to answer the question
of the long-time behavior of the erosion of the inner wall materials facing diﬀerent
plasma conditions.

Abstract

A suggestion is made for improving the Feldman-Cousins [1] method of esti-

mating signal counts in the presence of background. The method concentrates

on ﬁnding essential information about the signal and ignoring extraneous in-

formation about background. An appropriate method is found which uses

the condition that that the number of background events obtained does not

exceed the total number of events obtained. Several alternative approaches

are explored.

I. INTRODUCTION

Feldman and Cousins, [1] in a recent article, have made major advances towards solving

two long-standing problems concerning the use of conﬁdence levels for estimating a parame-

ter from data. The ﬁrst of these is eliminating the bias that occurs when one decides between

using a conﬁdence interval or a conﬁdence bound, after examining the data. The second

is ﬁnding a conﬁdence interval when the experimental result produces estimators that are

close to or past known bounds for the parameters of interest. Feldman and Cousins’ method

is called the uniﬁed approach below and is described in Section 2. In the present paper we

argue that the uniﬁed approach does not make quite enough of an allowance for the known

bounds and suggest a modiﬁcation. The modiﬁcation is illustrated with the KARMEN 2

Data, [2] where precisely this problem has arisen. The KARMEN group has been searching

for a neutrino oscillation signal reported by an LSND experiment [3]. As of Summer 1998,

they had expected to see 2.88 ± 0.13 background events and 1.0 - 1.5 signal events, if the

LSND results were real, but had seen no events. From their analysis, they claimed to almost

exclude the eﬀect claimed by the LSND experiment.

To be speciﬁc recall that the Poisson density with mean µ is

pµ(k) =

µke−µ

1
k!

(1)

for k = 0, 1, 2, · · ·, and let Pµ denote the corresponding distribution function, Pµ(k) =

pµ(0) + · · · + pµ(k). Suppose that background radiation is added to a signal producing a

total observed count, n say, that follows a Poisson distribution with mean b + λ. Here

the background and signal are assumed to be independent Poisson random variables, with

means b and λ respectively. What are appropriate conﬁdence intervals for λ if no events are

observed (n = 0) or, more generally, if n is smaller than b? For n = 0 and a 90% conﬁdence

level, the uniﬁed intervals all have left endpoints at λ = 0, while the right endpoints decrease

from 2.44 when b = 0 to 0.98 when b = 5. These are the right answers within the formulation

of the uniﬁed approach.

2

The formulation is suspect, however, because the conﬁdence intervals should not depend

on b when n = 0. For if no events are observed, then both the signal and background

radiation must have been zero.

It is as if two independent experiments were performed,

one for the background and one for the signal. The fact that there were no background

events may be interesting but it is not directly relevant to inference about λ once the signal

is known, and certainly the a priori expectation b of the background radiation is irrelevant

when one knows that the actual background was 0. In this case, the conﬁdence interval for

λ should be the same as if one had observed a signal of strength 0–either 2.44 using the

uniﬁed approach, or 2.30 using an upper conﬁdence bound. Statisticians have a name for

situations like this one. The background radiation is called an ancillary variable, because its

distribution does not depend on unknown parameters, and conventional statistical wisdom

calls for conditioning on ancillary variables when possible [4]. That is what we just did,

since conditioning on no background events leaves n as the signal.

Our modiﬁcation does not depend on b when n = 0. It is described in Section 2, where it

is compared to the unmodiﬁed procedure. For the KARMEN 2 data the modiﬁed conﬁdence

region is substantially larger than the unmodiﬁed one and overlaps the major portion of the

LSND region. The modiﬁcation is compared to a Bayesian solution in Section 4 and shown

to agree with it quite well, especially for low counts. Some other possible modiﬁcations are

discussed brieﬂy in Section 3. Giunti [5] has also proposed a modiﬁcation of the uniﬁed

approach and applied it to the KARMEN 2 data. Our approach is contrasted with his in

Section 3.

II. AN IMPROVED METHOD

It is not trivial to generalize the method just described to the case of non-zero counts n

that may be small compared to the expected background radiation. For if n > 0, then it is

no longer possible to recover the background and signal. The key to our modiﬁcation is to

remember that a conﬁdence interval consists of values of the parameter that are consistent

3

with the data (that is, are not rejected by an hypothesis test whose signiﬁcance level is

one minus the conﬁdence level). This is also the approach taken by Feldman and Cousins.

Suppose, for example, that the expected background radiation is b = 3 but that only one

event is observed (n = 1). Is λ = 2 inconsistent with this observation? From one point of

view it is. If λ = 2, then the probability of observing at most one event is e−5+5e−5 = 6e−5 =

.040, which is less than the usual levels of signiﬁcance. On the other hand, if only one event

is observed, then there can have been at most one background event, and this information

should be included in assessing signiﬁcance. For the probability of at most one background

event, e−3 + 3e−3 = 4e−3 = .199, is not large, and if the statement λ = 2 is regarded as

an hypothesis, then it seems unfair to include lower than expected background radiation

as evidence against it. The way to remove the eﬀect of the low background radiation is

to compute the conditional probability of at most one event (total), given at most one

background event. The latter is 6e−5/4e−3 = 1.5 × e−2 = .203, which is not less than the

usual levels of signiﬁcance.

Some notation is required to adapt this reasoning to the uniﬁed approach. The likelihood

function in the signal plus background problem is Lb(λ|n) = pb+λ(n), where n is the observed

count. Following Feldman and Cousins, let ˆλ = max[0, n−b] denote the maximum likelihood

estimator of λ and let

be the likelihood ratio statistic for testing λ. Then the uniﬁed approach consists of taking

those λ for which R(λ, n) ≥ c(λ), where c(λ) is the largest value of c for which

Rb(λ, n) =

Lb(λ|n)
Lb(ˆλ|n)

pb+λ(k) ≤ α

Xk:Rb(λ,k)<c

(2)

(3)

and 1 − α is the desired conﬁdence level. In words, the left side of (3) is the probability

that Rb(λ, n) < c; a level α generalized likelihood ratio test [6] rejects the hypothesis λ = λ0

if Rb(λ0, n) < c(λ0); and the uniﬁed conﬁdence intervals consist of those λ that are not

rejected. The modiﬁcation suggested here consists of replacing pb+λ(k) by the conditional

probability of exactly k events total given at most n background events. The latter is

4

pb+λ(k)/Pb(n)

if k ≤ n

n
j=0 pb(j)pλ(k − j)/Pb(n) if k > n,

qn

since k total events imply at most n background events when k ≤ n. Let ˜Rn

b (λ, k) denote

the likelihood ratio obtained using qn

b,λ(k); i.e., ˜Rn

b (λ, k) = qn

b,λ′(k). Let ˜cn(λ)

be the largest value of c for which

(4)

(5)

qn
b,λ(k) ≤ α.

Xk: ˜Rn

b (λ,k)<c

Then the modiﬁed conﬁdence interval consists of those λ for which ˜Rn

b (λ, n) ≥ ˜cn(λ).

The modiﬁed and original uniﬁed approaches are compared in Figure 1 for the special

case b = 3 and n = 0, · · · , 15. Observe that the modiﬁed intervals are wider for small

n and that there is not much diﬀerence for large n. The latter result is to be expected,

since there is not much diﬀerence between qn

b,λ and pb+λ for large n. In the case of small

n, the rationale for the modiﬁcation is as above.

If n is smaller than b, then there was

less background radiation than expected, and this information should be used in assessing

signiﬁcance. Observe further, that the modiﬁcation does not depend on b when n = 0,

because q0

b,λ does not depend on b.

For the KARMEN 2 Data, b = 2.88 ± 0.13 and n = 0. At the 90% conﬁdence level, the

uniﬁed approach leads to 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1.08, and the modiﬁed approach leads to 0 ≤ λ ≤ 2.42.

As above, values of λ between 1.08 and 2.42 are found to be inconsistent with the data by

the uniﬁed approach, but this is due to lower than expected background radiation, and the

inconsistency disappears after adjusting for the low background radiation. On the basis of

this data, it is not reasonable to exclude the possibility of signal.

To summarize, if one thinks of the conﬁdence set as the set of λ that are not rejected by

a test, then it is unwise to reject a value of λ because the background radiation was smaller

than expected. To be complete (and fair), Feldman and Cousins were aware of the problems

inherent with low counts. For such cases, they suggest reporting the conﬁdence intervals

that would have been used had n been equal or close to b, along with the intervals for the

observed n.

III. OTHER POSSIBLE MODIFICATIONS

The rationale given for the modiﬁcation in Section 2 could also have been used to support

other modiﬁcations. We describe these brieﬂy here and explain our preference for the one

described in Section 2. We also contrast our modiﬁcation with that of Giunti.

The modiﬁcation described in Section 2 replaces pb+λ with qn

b,λ in the derivation of the

uniﬁed approach, thus replacing Rb(λ, k) by ˜Rn

b (λ, k) = qn

b,λ(k)/ maxλ′ qn

b,λ′(k) in (2) and

replacing Equation (3) by Equation (5). An alternative modiﬁcation would be to keep the

uniﬁed approach criterion Rb(λ, n) but calibrate the associated tests diﬀerently, by replacing
b,λ in Equation (3) and, therefore, c(λ) with cn(λ) (except that R not ˜R is used).

pb+λ with qn

We have explored this approach and found it to be very similar to the one presented. It has

the disadvantage that the limits for n = 0 are slightly dependent on b.

Our approach may be contrasted with that of Giunti, [5] who has suggested a diﬀerent

modiﬁcation of the uniﬁed approach, called the new ordering approach. His physical argu-

ments are along similar lines to ours. However, in detail his approach diﬀers. In the new

ordering approach, Rb(λ, n) is replaced by RN O

b

(λ, n) = pλ+b(n)/pλNO+b(n) in Equation 3,

where λN O is the Bayes’ estimate of λ for a uniform prior. (We shall describe the Bayes’

approach further in the next section.) The calibration then proceeds as in Equation 3, us-

ing pb+λ(k). The resulting intervals are shorter than ours, but depend on b when n = 0.

Amusingly, our intervals are closer to the Bayesian intervals than are Giunti’s intervals, even

though our approach is entirely frequentist. See Table 1 below.

In Equation (4),

qn
b,λ(n) =

pb+λ(n)
Pb(n)

(6)

is the conditional probability of n events (total) given at most n background events. This is

a very intuitive quantity but, unfortunately, is not a density in n, since Pb(n) < 1 for all n

and, therefore,

∞
n=0 qn

b,λ(n) >

∞
n=0 pb+λ(n) = 1. Of course, qn

b,λ(n) could be renormalized by

κ(λ) :=

P
P
∞
b,λ(n), and the resulting ratio qn
n=0 qn

b,λ(n)/κ(λ) would be a density; but, because

P

6

κ is a function of λ, this density lacks the initiative appeal of qn

b,λ since the deﬁnition of the

experiment producing this density becomes unclear.

A closely related quantity is the conditional probability of at most n events total, given

at most n background events

Db,λ(n) =

Pb+λ(n)
Pb(n)

.

It is not obvious, but Db,λ(n) is a distribution function in n for reasons explained below. Let

db,λ(n) = Db,λ(n) − Db,λ(n − 1) denote the corresponding density. Still another alternative

is to replace pb+λ by db,λ in the uniﬁed approach. This too led to a procedure that was more

complicated and no more eﬃcient than the modiﬁcation described in Section 2.

To see that Db,λ(n) is a distribution function in n, ﬁrst observe that limn→∞ Db,λ(n) =

limn→∞ Pb+λ(n)/Pb(n) = 1/1 = 1. So, it suﬃces to show that Db,λ(n) is non-decreasing in n.

For this, note that, after some manipulation, db,λ(n) can be written in either of the following

forms for n > 0:

db,λ(n) = qn

b,λ(n) −

k=0 pλ+b(k)

The discussion in this section makes use of the following identity, which may be estab-

lished by repeated integrations by parts: if m is any positive integer and c ≥ 0, then

This has an amusing consequence: While qn

b,λ(n) is not a density in n, it is a density in λ;

that is,

∞

0
Z

qn
b,λ(n)dλ = 1.

(11)

(12)

It follows that qb,λ(n) is the (formal) posterior distribution that is obtained when λ is given

an (improper) uniform distribution over the interval 0 ≤ λ < ∞. (It is also the limiting

posterior that is obtained if λ is given a (proper) uniform distribution over the interval

0 ≤ λ ≤ Λ and then Λ is allowed to approach ∞). Moreover, using (10) again, leads to the

following curious relation

∞

λ0

Z

qn
b,λ(n)dλ = Db,λ0(n).

That is, the posterior probability that λ exceeds λ0 given n is the conditional probability

of at most n events total given at most n background events when λ = λ0. Hence, using

D, one of our possibilities above, although fully based on a frequentist approach, has some

Bayesian justiﬁcation. The Giunti approach, mentioned above, fundamentally uses a partly

Bayesian, partly frequentist approach.

Treating qn

b,λ(n) as the posterior density in λ leads to Bayesian credible (conﬁdence)

intervals of the form {λ : qn

b,λ(n) ≥ cn}, where cn is so chosen to control the posterior

probability of coverage; that is,

qn
b,λ(n)dλ = 1 − α.

Z{λ:qn

b,λ(n)≥cn}

(13)

Relation (12) is useful in computing the latter integral. The endpoints of these intervals

have been computed for selected b and n and are compared to the endpoints of the modiﬁed

uniﬁed approach in Table 1.

V. SUMMARY

We have suggested a modiﬁcation to the uniﬁed approach of Feldman and Cousins to

further improve the estimation of signal counts in the presence of background. It consists

of replacing the density function corresponding to the Poisson distribution pb+λ(k), with

the conditional density function qn

b,λ(k). We noted that this method has a clear frequentist

justiﬁcation and is the answer to a clear statistics question.

We compared the results using this modiﬁcation to the uniﬁed approach with the results

obtained using the unmodiﬁed uniﬁed approach. In contradistinction to the old method,

the new method leads naturally to sensible results if the observation has fewer events than

expected from background events alone.

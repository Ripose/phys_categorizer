of Voltage Pulse in SAGE Proportional Counters

A kind of analysis of waveform of voltage pulse in small proportional
counter is described. The technique is based on deconvolution of recorded
pulse with a response function of the counter.
It allows one to restore a
projection of the track of initial ionization to the radius of the counter, or a
charge collection function.

I. INTRODUCTION

One of main procedures of solar neutrino ﬂux measurement in gallium experiments is
a detection of several atoms of 71Ge in a small proportional counter.
71Ge decays solely
via electron capture to the ground state of 71Ga. In the proportional counter 1.2 keV and
10.4 keV Auge-electrons are usually detected. These low-energy electrons produce a nearly
point-like ionization in the counter gas. This ionization will arrive at the anode wire of
the proportional counter as a unit resulting in a fast rise time for the pulse. In contrast,
although a typical β-particle produced by a background process may also lose 1 keV to 15
keV in the counter gas, it will leave an extended trail of ionization. The ionization will arrive
at the anode wire distributed in time according to its radial extent in the counter, which
usually gives a pulse with a slower rise time than for a 71Ge event. The identiﬁcation of
true 71Ge events and the rejection of background events is thus greatly facilitated by using
a two parameter analysis: a candidate 71Ge event must not only fall within the appropriate
energy region, but must also have a rise time consistent with point-like ionization.

The anode wire is directly connected to a charge-sensitive preampliﬁer. After further
ampliﬁcation the signal is going (in SAGE) to the digital oscilloscope HP5411D, which
records the voltage pulse waveform with 8-bit voltage resolution and 1 ns time resolution
for 800 ns after pulse onset. A typical pulse produced by 10.4 keV Auge-electron after 71Ge
decay is shown on Fig. 1.

II. STANDARD ANALYSIS OF WAVEFORM

There are several diﬀerent techniques which are applied to waveform analysis in both
gallium solar neutrino experiments. All of them are described in detail elsewhere (see [1],
[2] for SAGE,
[3] for GALLEX). For example, in the standard analysis of SAGE data so
called TN method is used there. A functional form described in [1] with parameter TN
characterizing rise time of the pulse is written for ﬁt the observed pulse to. This technique
gives the correct description of the shape of the voltage pulse as recorded by the digital
oscilloscope when the ionization produced in the proportional counter consists of a set of
point ionizations evenly distributed along a straight track. Since 71Ge events are usually a

single cluster of ionization, this method works satisfactorily to select 71Ge candidate events.
It is, however, restricted to the particular form of ionization that is assumed, and gives a
poor ﬁt to other types of charge deposit in the counter, such as the combination of a point
event from 71Ge K-electron capture followed by capture of the 9.3-keV x ray at some other
location in the counter. To give us the capability to investigate all possible events that may
occur in the counter, we have also developed a more general method which can analyze
an event produced by ionization with an arbitrary distribution of charge. We call this the
‘restored pulse method’, or ‘RST method’ for short.

III. DESCRIPTION OF RST TECHNIQUE

We begin with the measured voltage pulse V (t) as recorded by the digitizer. For an
ideal point charge that arrives at the counter anode wire, V (t) has the Wilkinson form
V (t) = W (t) = V0 ln(1 + t/t0), provided the counter is ideal and the pulse processing
electronics has inﬁnite bandwidth. For a real event from the counter, with unknown charge
distribution, V (t) can in general be expressed as the convolution of the Wilkinson function
with a charge collection function G(t):

V (t) = W (t) ⊗ G(t).

(3.1)

The function G(t) contains within it the desired information about the arrival of charge
at the counter anode, coupled with any deviations of the counter or electronics from ideal
response. Equation (3.1) can be considered as the deﬁnition of G(t).

To get the desired function G(t), one must deconvolute Eq. (3.1). To perform this
deconvolution, we have found it mathematically convenient to use the current pulse I(t),

An example of this procedure as applied to a typical 71Ge K-peak event is given in Fig.
2. This pulse has TN = 3.9 ns. The recorded voltage pulse after inversion and smoothing is
given by V (T ) in the lower panel. The current pulse, obtained by numerical diﬀerentiation
of the voltage pulse, is given by I(t) in the upper panel. The deduced function G(t) is also
shown in the upper panel. It has a FWHM of about 15 ns, found to be typical for true 71Ge
K-peak events. The integrated current pulse, which records the pulse energy, is given by

IV. CONCLUSION

This method has the advantage that it can reveal the basic nature of the ionization in the
counter for an arbitrary pulse. It is also capable of determining the pulse energy over a wider
range than the TN method. A problem that has been found with this method in practice,
however, is that when 71Ge data are analyzed one obtains multiple collection functions (i.e.,
G(t) has several distinct peaks separated in time) more often than is expected from the
known physical processes that take place in the counter. These multiple peaks are due to
noise on the pulse and cutoﬀ of the system frequency response at about 100 MHz. Attempts
have been made to remove these extraneous peaks by ﬁltering and smoothing the original
pulse, but they have not been fully successful. Evidently we need faster electronics and a
reduction in the noise level to be able to fully exploit this pulse shape analysis technique. As
a result, we have only been able to use this method to select events on the basis of energy.

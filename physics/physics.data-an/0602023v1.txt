sPlot : A QUICK INTRODUCTION

M. PIVK
CERN, 1211 Geneva 23, Switzerland
E-mail: muriel.pivk@cern.ch

The paper advocates the use of a statistical tool dedicated to the exploration of data samples populated by several
sources of events. This new technique, called sPlot, is able to unfold the contributions of the diﬀerent sources to the
distribution of a data sample in a given variable. The sPlot tool applies in the context of a Likelihood ﬁt which is
performed on the data sample to determine the yields of the various sources.

1 Introduction

This paper describes a new technique to explore
a data sample when the latter consists of several
sources of events merged into a single sample of
events. The events are assumed to be characterized
by a set of variables which can be split into two com-
ponents. The ﬁrst component is a set of variables for
which the distributions of all the sources of events are
known: below, these variables are referred to as the
discriminating variable. The second component is a
set of variables for which the distributions of some
sources of events are either truly unknown or consid-
ered as such: below, these variables are referred to
as the control variables.

The new technique, termed sPlot a, allows one
to reconstruct the distributions for the control vari-
able, independently for each of the various sources of
events, without making use of any a priori knowledge
on this variable. The aim is thus to use the knowl-
edge available for the discriminating variables to be
able to infer the behavior of the individual sources
of events with respect to the control variable. An es-
sential assumption for the sPlot technique to apply
is that the control variable is uncorrelated with the
discriminating variables.

The sPlot technique is developed in the context
of a maximum Likelihood method making use of the
discriminating variables. Section 2 is dedicated to
the deﬁnition of fundamental objects necessary for
the following. Section 3 presents an intermediate
technique, simpler but inadequate, which is a ﬁrst
step towards the sPlot technique. The sPlot formal-
ism is then developed Section 4 and its properties
explained in Section 5. An example of sPlot at work
is provided in Section 6 and some applications are

described in Section 7. Finally, the case where the
control variable is correlated with the discriminating
ones is discussed in Section 8.

2 Basics and deﬁnitions

One considers an unbinned extended maximum Like-
lihood analysis of a data sample in which are merged
several species (signal and background) of events.
The log-Likelihood is expressed as:

N

Ns

Ns

L =

ln

Nifi(ye)

−

Ni ,

(1)

e=1
X

n

i=1
X

o

i=1
X

where

• N is the total number of events considered,

• Ns is the number of species of events populating

the data sample,

• Ni is the (non-integral) number of events ex-

pected on the average for the ith species,

• y represents the set of discriminating variables,

which can be correlated with each other,

• fi(ye) is the value of the Probability Density
Function (pdf) of y for the ith species and for
event e.

The log-Likelihood L is a function of the Ns yields Ni
and, possibly, of implicit free parameters designed to
tune the pdfs on the data sample. These parameters
as well as the yields Ni are determined by maximiz-
ing the above log-Likelihood.

The crucial point for the reliability of such an
analysis is to use an exhaustive list of sources of
events combined with an accurate description of all
the pdfs fi. If the distributions of the control vari-
ables are known (resp. unknown) for a particular

source of events, one would like to compare the ex-
pected distribution for this source to the one ex-
tracted from the data sample (resp. determine the
distribution for this source) b.

The control variable x which, by deﬁnition, does
not explicitly appear in the expression of L, can be:

1. totally correlated with the discriminating vari-
ables y (x belongs to the set y for example).
This is the case treated in Section 3.

2. uncorrelated with y. This is the subject of Sec-

tion 4.

Section 8.

3. partly correlated with y. This case is discussed

In an attempt to have access to the distributions of
control variables, a common method consists of ap-
plying cuts which are designed to enhance the con-
tributions to the data sample of particular sources of
events. However, the result is frequently unsatisfac-
tory: ﬁrstly because it can be used only if the signal
has prominent features to be distinguished from the
background, and secondly because of the cuts ap-
plied, a sizeable fraction of signal events can be lost,
while a large fraction of background events may re-
main.

The aim of the sPlot formalism developed in this
paper is to unfold the true distribution (denoted in
boldface Mn(x)) of a control variable x for events
of the nth species (any one of the Ns species), from
the sole knowledge of the pdfs of the discriminat-
ing variables fi, the ﬁrst step being to proceed to
the maximum Likelihood ﬁt to extract the yields Ni.
The statistical technique sPlot allows to build his-
tograms in x keeping all signal events while getting
rid of all background events, and keeping track of the
statistical uncertainties per bin in x.

3 First step towards sPlot: inPlot

In this Section, as a means of introduction, one con-
siders a variable x assumed to be totally correlated
with y: x is a function of y. A ﬁt having been per-
formed to determine the yields Ni for all species, one
can deﬁne naively, for all events, the weight

Pn(ye) =

Nnfn(ye)
Ns
k=1 Nkfk(ye)

,

(2)

which can be used to build an estimate, denoted ˜Mn,
of the x-distribution of the species labelled n (signal
or background):

Nn ˜Mn(¯x)δx ≡

Pn(ye) ,

(3)

e⊂δx
X

where the sum runs over the events for which the x
value lies in the bin centered on ¯x and of total
width δx.

In other words, Nn ˜Mn(¯x)δx is the x-distribution
obtained by histogramming events, using the weight
of Eq. (2). To obtain the expectation value of ˜Mn,
one should replace the sum in Eq. (3) by the integral

*

e⊂δx+
X

Z

Ns

j=1
X

−→

dy

Njfj (y)δ(x(y) − ¯x)δx .

(4)

Similarly, identifying the number of events Ni as de-
termined by the ﬁt to the expected number of events,
one readily obtains:

Nn ˜Mn(¯x)
E

D

≡ NnMn(¯x) .

(5)

Therefore, the sum over events of the naive weight Pn
reproduces, on average, the true distribution Mn(x).
Plots obtained that way are referred to as inPlots:
they provide a correct means to reconstruct Mn(x)
only insofar as the variable considered is in the set
of discriminating variables y. These inPlots suﬀer
from a major drawback: x being fully correlated to
y, the pdfs of x enter implicitly in the deﬁnition of the
naive weight, and as a result, the ˜Mn distributions
cannot be used easily to assess the quality of the ﬁt,
because these distributions are biased in a way diﬃ-
cult to grasp, when the pdfs fi(y) are not accurate.
For example, let us consider a situation where, in the
data sample, some events from the nth species show
up far in the tail of the Mn(x) distribution which
is implicitly used in the ﬁt. The presence of such
events implies that the true distribution Mn(x) must
exhibit a tail which is not accounted for by Mn(x).
These events would enter in the reconstructed inPlot
˜Mn with a very small weight, and they would thus
escape detection by the above procedure: ˜Mn would
be close to Mn, the distribution assumed for x. Only
a mismatch in the core of the x-distribution can be
revealed with inPlots. Stated diﬀerently, the error
bars which can be attached to each individual bin of

the covariance-weighted quantity (thereafter called
sWeight) deﬁned by:

4 The sPlot formalism

In this Section one considers the more interesting
case where the two sets of variables x and y are un-
correlated. Hence, the total pdfs fi(x, y) all factorize
into products Mi(x)fi(y). While performing the ﬁt,
which relies only on y, no a priori knowledge of the
x-distributions is used.

One may still consider the above distribution ˜Mn
(Eq. (3)), using the naive weight of Eq. (2). However
in that case, the expectation value of ˜Mn is a biased
estimator of Mn:

Here, the naive weight is no longer satisfactory
because, when summing over the events, the x-
pdfs Mj(x) appear now on the right hand side of
Eq. (4), while they are absent in the weight. How-
ever, one observes that the correction term in the
right hand side of Eq. (6) is related to the inverse of
the covariance matrix, given by the second deriva-
tives of −L:

Hence, when x is uncorrelated with the set y, the

With this sWeight, the distribution of the control

variable x can be obtained from the sPlot histogram:

(12)

e⊂δx

which reproduces, on average, the true binned dis-
tribution:

Nn s ˜Mn(x)
E
D

= NnMn(x) .

(13)

The fact that the covariance matrix Vij enters in the
deﬁnition of the sWeights is enlightening: in particu-
lar, the sWeight can be positive or negative, and the
estimators of the true pdfs are not constrained to be
strictly positive.

Beside satisfying the essential asymptotic property
Eq. (13), sPlots bear properties which hold for ﬁnite
statistics.

The distribution s ˜Mn deﬁned by Eq. (12) is guar-
anteed to be normalized to unity and the sum over
the species of the sPlots reproduces the data sample
distribution of the control variable. These properties
rely on maximizing the Likelihood:

• Each x-distribution is properly normalized. The
sum over the x-bins of Nn s ˜Mnδx is equal to Nn:

sP n(ye) = Nn .

(14)

• In each bin, the sum over all species of the ex-
pected numbers of events equals to the number
of events actually observed.
In eﬀect, for any
event:

sP l(ye) = 1 .

(15)

N

e=1

Ns

l=1
X

Therefore, an sPlot provides a consistent represen-
tation of how all events from the various species are
distributed in the control variable x. Summing up
the Ns sPlots, one recovers the data sample distri-
bution in x, and summing up the number of events
entering in a sPlot for a given species, one recovers
the yield of the species, as it is provided by the ﬁt.
For instance, if one observes an excess of events for a

4

particular nth species, in a given x-bin, this excess is
eﬀectively accounted for in the number of events Nn
resulting from the ﬁt. To remove these events implies
a corresponding decrease in Nn. It remains to gauge
how signiﬁcant is an anomaly in the x-distribution
of the nth species.

The statistical uncertainty on Nn s ˜Mn(x)δx can

be deﬁned in each bin by

σ[Nn s ˜Mn(x)δx] =

(sP n)2 .

(16)

e⊂δx
s X

The above properties Eqs. (13)-(15) are completed
by the fact that the sum in quadrature of the un-
certainties Eq. (16) reproduces the statistical uncer-
tainty on the yield Nn, as it is provided by the ﬁt.
In eﬀect, the sum over the x-bins reads:
σ2[Nn s ˜Mnδx] = Vnn .

(17)

X[δx]

Therefore, for the expected number of events per x-
bin indicated by the sPlots, the statistical uncertain-
ties are straightforward to compute using Eq. (16).
The latter expression is asymptotically correct, and
it provides a consistent representation of how the
overall uncertainty on Nn is distributed in x among
the events of the nth species. Because of Eq. (17),
and since the determination of the yields is optimal
when obtained using a Likelihood ﬁt, one can con-
clude that the sPlot technique is itself an optimal
method to reconstruct distributions of control vari-
ables.

6 Illustrations

An example of sPlot at work is taken from the anal-
ysis where the method was ﬁrst used 2,3. One deals
with a data sample in which three species are present:
B0→π+π− and B0→K +π− are signals and the main
background comes from e+e−→qq. The variable
which is not incorporated in the ﬁt is called ∆E and
is used here as the control variable x. The detailed
description of the variables can be found in Refs. 2,3.
The left plot of Fig. 1 shows the distribution
of ∆E after applying a cut on the Likelihood ratio.
Therefore, the resulting data distribution concerns a
reduced subsample for which statistical ﬂuctuations
cannot be attributed unambiguously to signal or to
background. For example, the excess of events ap-
pearing on the left of the peak is likely to be at-
tributed to a harmless background ﬂuctuation.

ﬁgure is obtained applying a cut on the Likelihood ratio to
enrich the data sample in signal events (about 60% of signal
is kept). The right ﬁgure shows the sPlot for signal (all events
are kept).

Looking at the right plot of Fig. 1, which is a
signal sPlot, one can see that these events are sig-
nal events, not background events. The pdf of ∆E
which is used in the conventional ﬁt for the whole
analysis is superimposed on the sPlot. When this
pdf is used, the events in excess are interpreted as
background events while performing the ﬁt. Further
studies have shown 2 that these events are in fact ra-
diative events, i.e. B0→π+π−γ. When ignored in the
analysis they lead to underestimates of the branching
ratios by about 10%. The updated results 4 for the
B0→π+π−, K +π− analysis, now taking into account
the contribution of radiative events, show agreement
with the estimate made in Ref. 2.

7 Applications

Beside providing a convenient and optimal tool to
cross-check the analysis by allowing distributions of
control variables to be reconstructed and then com-
pared with expectations, the sPlot formalism can be
applied also to extract physics results, which would
otherwise be diﬃcult to obtain. For example, one
may be willing to explore some unknown physics
involved in the distribution of a variable x. Or,
one may be interested to correct a particular yield
provided by the Likelihood ﬁt from a selection eﬃ-
ciency which is known to depend on a variable x, for
which the pdf is unknown. Provided one can demon-
strate (e.g. through Monte-Carlo simulations) that
the variable x exhibits weak correlation with the dis-
criminating variables y.

To be speciﬁc, one can take the example of a
three body decay analysis of a species, the signal,

polluted by background. The signal pdf inside the
two-dimensional Dalitz plot is assumed to be not
known, because of unknown contributions of reso-
nances, continuum and of interference pattern. Since
the x-dependence of the selection eﬃciency ǫ(x) can
be computed without a priori knowledge of the x-
distributions, one can build the eﬃciency corrected
two-dimensional sPlots (cf. Eq. (12)):

Nn s ˜Mn(¯x)δx =

Analyses can then use the sPlot formalism for valida-
tion purposes, but also, using Eq. (18) and Eq. (19),
to probe for resonance structures and to measure
branching ratios 5.

Carlo simulation, and apply the sPlot technique to

to be compared to the sPlot obtained with the real
data. Stated diﬀerently, the sPlot can still be ap-
plied to compare the behaviour of the data with the
Monte-Carlo expected behavior, but it loses its sim-
plicity.

9 Conclusion

5

• one examines a data sample originating from dif-

ferent sources of events,

• a Likelihood ﬁt is performed on the data sample

to determine the yields of the sources,

• this Likelihood uses a set y of discriminating

variables,

• keeping aside a control variable x which is sta-

tistically uncorrelated to the set y.

By building sPlots, one can reconstruct the distri-
butions of the control variable x, separately for each
source present in the data sample. Although no cut
is applied (hence, the sPlot of a given species repre-
sents the whole statistics of this species) the distri-
butions obtained are pure in a statistical sense: they
are free from the potential background arising from
the other species. The more discriminating the vari-
ables y, the clearer the sPlot is. The technique is
straightforward to implement; it is available in the
ROOT framework under the class TSPlot6. It fea-
tures several nice properties: both the normaliza-
tions and the statistical uncertainties of the sPlots
reﬂect the ﬁt ouputs.

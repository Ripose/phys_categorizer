The Error in the Two Envelope Paradox

(Dated: August 8, 2006)

The ”paradox” arises in the Two Envelopes Paradox from the incorrect formulation of the ar-
gument. The infomation given is misused and therefore the results are incorrect for the question
asked. The key is to be clear on what question we are asking. We must make sure that the question
that is asked is the question that is written down.

INTRODUCTION

Here is the situation: There are two identical sealed
envelopes, marked ”A” and ”B”, that each contain a
diﬀerent sum of money. You are handed the enveloped
marked A. You are told that one envelope contains twice
the amount of money as the other envelope. Now you
are given the choice to keep the envelope that you have
or switch it for the other envelope.
In some scenarios
you are allowed to open the envelope that you have and
count the money before making a decision. So, what do
you do?

Clearly being able to count the money of one of the
envelopes is irrelevant information.
In other words, it
does not tell you anything about the other envelope since
you were not told the sum total of the two envelopes.
This leaves us with the original situation described above.
The solution to the question has traditionally been
formulated like this: There is a one to one symmetry
between the envelopes. Thus there is a 50% chance of
getting the larger amount of money. However, if we cal-
culate the expectation of, let’s say A, then one gets a
very diﬀerent result. Let us look at the two possibilities
for A. The ﬁrst is that A contains twice the amount as
B (A = 2B). The second is that A has half of what B
contains (A = B
2 ). Now if we calculate the expectation
value we get,

hAi =

(2B) +

How can the expectation value of A be greater than that
of B? According to this A should always be expected to
hold more than B and one should always keep the enve-
lope. However, if A and B are switched in the calculation
the opposite occurs and one should always switch the en-
velope. Herein lies the paradox, which should you do?
Keep A or trade it for B?

II. THE ERROR IN THE QUESTION

incorrectly. The ﬁrst question has to do with which enve-
lope we should keep. As far as this question goes, the only
relevant information is that the two envelopes are identi-
cal. Whether one has more money than the other one is
inconsequential because you have no way of ﬁnding out
what the other envelope holds. Here is another example:
Suppose someone ﬂips a fair coin and asks you what the
outcome is going to be. You have a 50/50 chance of being
correct. Now you are told that the coin is unfair, or that
the person who ﬂipped the coin is able to get whichever
side they want. What are your chances of being correct
now? From your perspective, it is still 50/50! The extra
information is irrelevant to you because you can only pick
heads or tails. Thus, the only information that you can
actually use is the fact that the coin has two sides and
as such, will not inﬂuence you about which side to pick.
So, from your perspective, it does not matter which one
you pick.

The second question asks, ”What do you expect the
value of the envelope you are holding to be?” Unfortu-
nately that is not the question that we wrote down. The
error lies in what we claim are the two possibilities. The
possibilities for envelope A are twice that of what enve-
lope B contains or one half of what B contains. This
is either two units or one unit, since the ratio between
the two is 2:1. Here we choose the ﬁrst possibility as the
”two unit” possibility. The second possibility therefore
must be the ”one unit” possibility which is half of the
ﬁrst possibility. Thus the expectation should be written
as follows,

hAi =

(2U nits) +

(U nits) =

U nits

Which is what one would expect the average to be, ex-
actly one half of the total units. Expectation used in
this way is, after all, an average. And, after many tri-
als (n → ∞), one would expect to get an average of 1.5
units. The point to understand here is that one cannot
have both 2 units and a half of a unit simultaneously.

The solution to this paradox is very simple, we are ask-
ing two diﬀerent questions and the second one is written

III. CONCLUSIONS

In the end it is not the logic that usually creates a para-
dox, it is the misuse or misinterpretation of it. There are
several lessons to be learned from this kind of problem.

First is that one has to be very careful that the question
one is writing is indeed the question that one is asking.
As has been demonstrated, this was the case. The sec-
ond lesson is understanding when tools are useful and
when they are not. For example look at the tossing of a
die. With one toss the expectation value is 3.5 units or
dots. However, this number is not even a possible out-
come! But, when the die is thrown many times the aver-
age amount of units will indeed be 3.5. In the envelope
case illustrated above, the one half that is used for the
probability in the expectation value is really a frequency.
The probability distribution is actually ﬂat and therefore

one should have no expectation of what the value of the
envelope is at all. On the other hand when there are
many trials, as a frequency suggests, one should right-
fully expect to get the average of the envelopes which is
precisely what we attained.

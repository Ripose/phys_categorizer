A general method is proposed which allows one to estimate drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients of a
stochastic process governed by a Langevin equation. It extends a previously devised approach [R.
Friedrich et al., Physics Letters A 271, 217 (2000)], which requires suﬃciently high sampling rates.
The analysis is based on an iterative procedure minimizing the Kullback-Leibler distance between
measured and estimated two time joint probability distributions of the process.

INTRODUCTION

Complex behavior in systems far from equilibrium can
quite often be traced back to rather simple laws due to
the existence of processes of selforganization [1]. Since
complex systems are composed of a huge number of sub-
systems, however, ﬂuctuations stemming from the micro-
scopic degrees of freedom play an important role intro-
ducing a temporal variation on a fast time scale which
quite often can be considered as ﬂuctuations. The con-
sequence is the existence of evolution equations of a set
of macroscopic order parameters q(t) which are governed
by nonlinear Langevin equations [2], [3]:

dqi = D1

Analyzing complex systems, which can be described by
stochastic equations of the form (1), therefore, amounts
to assess the underlying Langevin equations or the cor-
responding Fokker-Planck equations from an inspection
of experimentally determined time series [4]. Recently,
an operational method [5], [6] has been devised, which
allows one to estimate drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients of
the stochastic processes from experimental data. This
method has been successfully applied to various prob-
lems in the ﬁeld of complex systems like the analysis of
noisy electrical circuits [6], stochastic dynamics of metal
cutting [7], systems with feedback delay [8], meteorologi-
cal processes like wind-driven Southern Ocean variability
[9], traﬃc ﬂow data [11] and physiological time series [12].
Furthermore it has been applied to problems like turbu-
lent ﬂows [13], [14], passive scalar advection [15], ﬁnan-
cial time series [16], analysis of rough surfaces [17], [18],
which can be characterized as a stochastic process with

respect to a scale variable exhibiting markovian proper-
ties in scale.

The method is based on the evaluation of the time

From these expressions it becomes evident that the sam-
pling rate in the experiments has to be suﬃciently high
in order to allow for a reliable evaluation of the limit
τ
0. Therefore, in all applications mentioned above
the results have been checked in a selfconsistent manner
by a recalculation of conditional pdf’s from the estimated
Fokker-Planck equation. Possible problems in estimating
drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients related with low sampling
frequencies have been adressed by Sura [19], Ragwitz and
Kantz [20], [21] and Friedrich et al. [22].

The aim of the present letter is to devise an exten-
sion of the above method in order to overcome problems
related with the time limit τ
0. These problems im-
mediately show up for low sampling rates or for the case
of stochastic forces F(q, t) with small but ﬁnite temporal
correlations. Furthermore, uncorrelated noise sources,
so-called measurement noise [23] additionally may limit
the accuracy of the estimates (2).

II. DESCRIPTION OF THE METHOD

The starting point is a ﬁrst estimate of drift and diﬀu-
sion coeﬃcients by the expressions (2) evaluated for the
smallest reliably possible values of τ . The second step
is an embedding of drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients into a
family of functions D1(q, σ), D2(q, σ) parameterized by
a set of free parameters σ. The expressions obtained in
the ﬁrst step already yield a crude estimate of the pa-
rameters σ. The third step consists in optimizing the
free parameters σ.

for the parameter set σ either by a simulation of the
Langevin equations or by a numerical solution of the
corresponding Fokker-Planck equation.
In each case,
one can determine the two point pdf f (q, t; q0, t0; σ) =

The minimum of the Kullback-Leibler information
with respect to the parameters σ yields estimates of drift
and diﬀusion of a stochastic process. This process is the
best approximation with respect to this measure in the
class of stochastic processes characterized by the param-
eters σ. The problem of identifying a stochastic process
is then equivalent to determining a minimum of the Kull-
back information. In practice the minimum can be de-
termined by gradient or genetic algorithms and solved by
standard methods [24]. In the following we shall consider
cases, where it is possible to obtain a parametrization of
the stochastic processes by only few parameters σ such
that the Kullback-Leibler measure can be investigated by
graphical means.

III. EXAMPLES

For certain classes of stochastic processes the above
procedure can be reduced considerably by the fact that
only few free parameters for the parametrization of drift
and diﬀusion terms have to be introduced. As a con-
sequence the minimization procedure of the Kullback-
Leibler information is greatly facilitated.

−4 in the center. The distance be-
lines starting from 2.6 · 10
−5. A clear minimum is located at
tween contour lines is 5 · 10
(Q, a) = (1, 1).

Since f (q) can be determined from the time series an
estimate in terms of a parameterized ansatz for the dif-
fusion term suﬃces.
In fact, one may use the ansatz
D2(q) = Q + aq2 + bq4 + . . . , which helps in lowering the
number of parameters σ to be estimated by the above
procedure of minimization the Kullback-Leibler informa-
tion. The drift then follows from (6).

Let us consider system I with drift and diﬀusion func-

dure the two point pdf’s have to be calculated. We again

the most eﬃcient way to generate the pdf’s.

We generated a time series containing 106 points with
time increment 10−2. The time increment used for nu-
merical integration of the corresponding Langevin equa-
tion is 10−5. A time segment of the data is presented in
ﬁg. 1. Since the stochastic process is stationary and er-
godic all statistical quantities can be retrieved from this
data.

ansatz
D2(Q, a, q) = Q + aq2 is reasonable. The drift im-
mediately follows from (6) and, for each parameter set
(Q, a), one obtains a stationary distribution that equals
the experimental one. Due to this fact the evaluation
of the conditional pdf p(q, t + τ
q0, t; Q, a) suﬃces to
|
calculate the Kullback-Leibler distance.

For the estimation of the pdf’s from data state space
has to be divided into bins. We used 100 equidistant bins
for the stationary pdf. A very accurate way to calculate
the integral yielding the Kullback-Leibler distance with-
out running out of memory even for higher dimensional
data is to select a diﬀerent amount of bins for the con-
ditional pdf’s. The conditional pdf then locally can be
retrieved from the data for any q with high accuracy.

A clear minimum of the distance is found at (Q, a) =
(1, 1) corresponding to the original parameter set. The
Kullback distance close to this minimum in the two-
dimensional parameter space is exhibited in ﬁg. 2.

B. Application to potential systems

The procedure for one-dimensional systems can be im-
mediately extended to higher dimensions if one restricts
the analysis to the so-called class of potential systems for
which the drift vector D1(q) is obtained from a potential
V (q) and gik = √Qδik. The central point of our analysis

is the following exact expression for the stationary pdf

f (q) = N e

−V (q)/Q

.

(8)

Since the stationary pdf can be estimated from experi-
mental data one may parameterize the class of stochastic
processes by the single variable Q. Thus the drift func-
tion can be taken to be ﬁxed except for the value Q:

D1(q) = Q

ln f (q)

Since the drift D1(q) can be evaluated from (9) all pa-

imum is clearly visible at Q = 0.05 and agrees with the

tribution based on relation (9). The resulting drift vector

IV. CONCLUSION

Summarizing, we have outlined an operational method
for the estimation of drift and diﬀusion terms from ex-
perimental time series of stochastic Langevin processes.
In contrast to previous approaches the present algorithm
does not rely on estimating conditional moments in the
small time increment limit. Although this limit yields
a ﬁrst approximation an iterative reﬁnement of the esti-
mated stochastic process is performed by minimization
of the Kullback-Leibler distance between estimated and
measured two time probability distributions. The pro-
posed procedure solves the problem of estimating drift
and diﬀusion terms of Langevin processes from time se-
ries. It involves the numerical solution of Langevin equa-
tions with parameter dependent drift and diﬀusion terms,
an evaluation of the Kullback-Leibler integral (which
may be determined by means of a Monte-Carlo method)
and an optimization procedure, for which standard ap-
proaches can be used. All involved steps are based on
routine calculations. Furthermore, restriction to certain
classes of stochastic processes like potential systems can
drastically lower the numerical eﬀorts of the procedure.
Therefore, the proposed algorithm can be applied also to
systems with higher dimensional state spaces.

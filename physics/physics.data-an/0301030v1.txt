Abstract. We show that the continuous wavelet transform can provide a unique de-
composition of a timeseries in to ’signal-like’ and ’noise-like’ components: From the overall
wavelet spectrum two mutually independent skeleton spectra can be extracted, allowing
the separate detection and monitoring in even non-stationary timeseries of the evolution
of (a) both stable but also transient, evolving periodicities, such as the output of low
dimensional dynamical systems and (b) scale-invariant structures, such as discontinuities,
self-similar structures or noise. The idea of the method is to keep from the overall wavelet
expansion of the timeseries only the wavelet components of largest amplitude at any given
time or scale, thus obtaining the instantly maximal and scale maximal wavelet skeleton
spectrum, respectively. The scale maximal spectrum was previously proposed for studying
possible multifractal scaling properties of the timeseries (e.g. Arneodo et al., 1988). The
here proposed instantly maximal spectrum exhibits clearer spectral peaks and reduced
noise, as compared to the overall wavelet spectrum. An indicative application to the
monthly-averaged sunspot index reveals, apart from the well-known 11-year periodicity, 3
of its harmonics, the 2-year periodicity (quasi-biennial oscillation, QBO) and several more
(some of which detected previously in various solar, earth-solar connection and climate in-
dices), here proposed being just harmonics of the QBO, in all supporting the double-cycle
solar magnetic dynamo model (Benevolenskaya, 1998, 2000). The scale maximal spec-
trum reveals the presence of 1/f ﬂuctuations with timescales up to 1 year in the sunspot
number, indicating that the solar magnetic conﬁgurations involved in the transient so-
lar activity phenomena with those characteristic timescales are in a self-organized-critical
state (SOC), as previously proposed for the solar ﬂare occurence (Lu & Hamilton, 1991).

1 Introduction

The widely used Fourier transform, although useful for stationary signals of sim-
ple dynamics consisted of a linear superposition of few independent, strong, non-
evolving periodicities, has severe drawbacks for analyzing signals of the following two
important categories, often encountered as output of physically interesting complex
systems:

a. Signals that include transient or variable periodicities. The Fourier transform,
since integrating over the whole time domain, does not allow monitoring of amplitude
or frequency evolution in periodicities. A limited solution is to divide the signal in
segments or else ’windows’ (a method called short-time, Gabor or windowed Fourier

SIGNAL-NOISE DECOMPOSITION: APPLICATION TO SUNSPOTS

2

transform), however introducing the arbitrary, ﬁxed window width that imposes a
low frequency cut-oﬀ near which edge eﬀects occur, thus artiﬁcially deforming the
estimated spectrum.

b. Signals that signiﬁcantly depart from stationarity, consisted of intermittent
’activity bursts’ (e.g. energy releases), or hierarchies of localized structures in space
or time (e.g.
in turbulent ﬂuids reside eddies, discontinuities, ﬁlaments, sheets,
shocks etc.). For each localized structure a wide frequency range of strongly phase
coherent (i.e. ’synchronized’ in time) Fourier sine components are required to repro-
duce it, adding near and canceling away from the structure. Hence, each structure
spreads and become undetectable over the whole Fourier spectrum. Moreover, such
structures often exhibit ’self-similarity’, or else ’scale invariance’, i.e. consists of
hierarchies of mutually similar structures, emerging through a cascade mechanism,
and ’roughness’ over a wide scale range (well modeled by fractals and multi-fractals)
that is not built in the sine waves of Fourier transform.

The projection of signals with continuous or discrete wavelet analyzing func-
tions, that are by deﬁnition self-similar and well localized in both time (or space)
and frequency (or wavenumber) domains, provides eﬃcient descriptions, in terms
of sparseness, of non-stationary, transient, or ’bursty’ records. It is proven a useful
tool, used in an increasingly large variety of applications. Here we mention some of
them indicatively according to the type of use: detection of periodic signals in noisy
timeseries (e.g. Otazu et al., 2002), monitoring of period variations (e.g. Frick et
al., 1997, Fligge et al., 1999), unevenly sampled period analysis (e.g. Foster, 1996),
derivation of multifractal properties (e.g. Arneodo et al., 1988, Argoul et al., 1989,
Muzy et al., 1991, 1993, Arneodo et al., 1995, 1998), random multifractal synthe-
sis (e.g. Benzi etal, 1993), localized structure identiﬁcation (e.g. Lucek & Balogh,
1997, Roux et al., 1999, Mouri et al., 1999), polarization analysis (e.g. Baumjohann
et al., 1999), denoising (e.g. Fligge & Solanki, 1997, Komm et al., 1999), signal-
to-noise ratio enhancement (e.g. Zhang & Paulson, 1997), information compression
(e.g. Muhlmann & Hanslmeier, 1996), multi-resolution image decomposition (e.g.
Mallat, 1989, Pantin & Starck, 1996), studies of random walks (Arneodo et al.,
1996), ﬂow structure analysis (Haynes & Norton, 1993), population classiﬁcation
(Bendjoya et al., 1991), clustering detection (e.g. Bijaoui et al., 1993, Girardi et al.,
1997, Lima Neto et al., 1997), fast data query (e.g. Chakrabarti et al., 2001), ﬂuid
turbulence simulations (e.g. Schneider et al., 1997) etc.

The wavelet transform is now used extensively for the analysis of oscillations
and periodicities in various solar structural and activity features, as the sunspot
number (Fligge et al., 1999, Mordvidov & Kuklin, 1999, Sello, 2000, Rigozo et
al., 2001, Nayar et al., 2002), sunspot groups (Ballester & Oliver, 1999), active
regions (Ireland et al., 1999, O’Shea et al., 2001, 2002), coronal holes (Marsh et al.,
2002), bursts (Schwarz et al., 1998, Meszarosova et al., 1999, Gimenez et al., 2001),
ﬂares (Aschwanden et al., 1998), polar plumes (Banerjee et al., 2000), coronal loops
(De Moortel et al., 2000, 2002a, b), photospheric ﬂows (Lawrence et al., 2001),
chromosphere (Bocchialini & Baudin, 1995, Frick et al., 1997), transition region
(Fludra, 2001), diﬀerential rotation (Hempelmann & Donahue, 1997, Soon et al.,

1999, Hempelmann, 2002) etc.

In this article we demonstrate that two exactly deﬁned, mutually independent,
complementary wavelet skeleton spectra, extracted from the total continuous wavelet
spectrum, allow to discriminate the components of (stable or transient) periodici-
ties and of hierarchies of discontinuities in timeseries. An indicative application is
made to sunspot number, since (a) is known to include both periodic and noise-like
components, and (b) its study may contribute in understanding the features and
mechanism of the solar activity. Section 2 includes a brief review of the continuous
wavelet transform for the unfamiliar reader (for extended reviews see e.g. Hunt et
al., 1993, Kaiser, 1994, Louis et al., 1997, Torrence & Compo 1998). The two wavelet
skeleton spectra are introduced in Section 3. The application to the sunspot index
is presented in Section 4. Conclusions and discussion are summarized in Section 5.

2 A brief review of the wavelet transform

2.1 Linear functional projection

One way to quantify the degree of ’similarity’ between two, generally complex func-
tion x(t), y(t) of a variable t ∈ [0, T ] (e.g. time or distance) is by the amplitude (or
else cross-correlation) of their functional projection over the domain of t:

a =

T

1
T Z

0

x(t) y∗(t) dt

with y∗ being the complex conjugate of y. The factor 1/T makes the amplitude a
independent of T and ﬁnite in the limit T → +∞. The two functions are called
’orthogonal’ if a = 0.

In analogy to the projection of a vector to a coordinate system in physical space,
a given function x(t) (e.g. the timeseries of a measured observable) thus can be
analyzed to a family of functions y(t, pi), of n characteristic parameters pi, i = 1...n:

a(pi) =

x(t) y∗(t, pi) dt

T

1
T Z
0

The functional analysis (2) is linear in the sense that any x(t) can be expanded to
a linear superposition of a set of functions y(t, pi) that are mutually orthogonal and
integrable.

Note that the continuous functional transform (2) is generally redundant since it
spreads the information content of x(t) from the one-dimensional time axis, to the
n-dimensional space of the parameters pi. The minimization of information spread
in the parameter space pi by appropriate selection of the functional basis and the
development of eﬃcient redundancy reduction schemes is of central importance for
spectral analysis, functional approximation and compression applications.

2.2 Appropriate selection of analyzing functions

Although the linear functional projection (2) is mathematically valid with any set of
functions, an appropriate projection should aim in selecting such functions to match
as much as possible (i.e. being nearly orthogonal to most of the functions so that
the representation is sparse) the analyzed function, which often is or consists of the
following:

(a) Analog signal, as the independent variables of a system or model of relatively
simple dynamics. The usually smoothly varying variables of systems of low dimen-
sionality (i.e. small number of independent variables) exhibit oscillatory behavior,
thus can often be sparsely expanded to a linear superposition of a few periodic
functions, or, more generally, transient, quasi-periodic components. Hence, it is
desirable that the analyzing functions have well-deﬁned, single-peaked, narrow fre-
quency spectral content.

(b) Noise, as this due to observational ’random’ ﬂuctuations (often additive)
of high-frequency content, e.g. of ﬂat spectrum in uncorrelated (white) or more
generally of wide range power-law decaying spectrum in auto-correlated (’colored’)
noise. Noise-like contributions may also caused by fast-varying components of a
deterministic complex system of large number of independent variables (such as
macroscopic systems) or the interaction of a low-dimensional open system with an
environment of high dimensionality. The observables of high-dimensional systems,
often involving strongly turbulent ﬂuids, are characterized by intermittency or ’sin-
gularities’ due to coherent structures or intermittent energy bursts and, exact or
weaker, self-similarity between diﬀerent scales (often termed scale-invariance), well
modeled by fractals and multi-fractals. Although such systems are characterized
by strongly non-linear physical mechanisms, for an appropriate linear projection
of such observables, the analyzing functions should at least posses the element of
self-similarity.

2.3 Fourier transform

The widely used Fourier transform can be interpreted as mapping, or complete
’rotation’ (in analogy to the vector rotation in physical space) from the time domain
to the frequency domain, by means of the complex periodic plain wave functions:

The (generally complex) spectral amplitude (see equ. (2)):

y(t, f ) = e2πif t

a(f ) =

x(t) y∗(t, f ) dt

T

1
T Z
0

(3)

(4)

thus represents an estimate of the amplitude of periodicities of frequency f , that
occurred during the time interval T . The, often studied, Fourier power spectral
density is deﬁned as follows:

SIGNAL-NOISE DECOMPOSITION: APPLICATION TO SUNSPOTS

p(f ) = a2(f )

A useful property of the Fourier transforms is the power theorem: any linear func-
tional projection (2) can be calculated via Fourier transforms in the frequency do-
main (e.g. Hunt et al., 1993, p.6):

a(pi) =

x(t) y∗(t, pi) dt =

ˆx(f ) ˆy∗(f, pi) df

+∞

Z

−∞

T

Z
0

where ˆx, ˆy the Fourier transforms of x, y respectively (see (4)). Hence, the functional
projection (2) can be treated as a linear ﬁlter acting on ˆx.

2.4 Time-frequency analysis

Note that each Fourier basis function y is totally localized in frequency but nowhere
in time, since having inﬁnite duration (i.e. y in (3) do not vanish for t → ±∞). As a
consequence, the Fourier transform does not allow monitoring of transient (periodic
or aperiodic) components in the signal, since they are spread over the whole Fourier
spectrum.

In the framework of the transform (2) a solution to this problem is to introduce
analysing functions of well-deﬁned frequency but are also localized in time i.e. of
signiﬁcant amplitude for a ﬁnite time duration.

Perfect localization in both time and frequency in however inhibited by the
uncertainty principle (e.g. Kaiser, 1994, p. 50): (2) keeps the information of x(t)
conﬁned in cells, within which there is total uncertainty about the information of
x(t), and the size of these cells cannot be inﬁnitesimally small, having a lower limit
depending on the properties (shape, rate of decay etc.) of the selected analysing
functions.

Any time-frequency transform represents a mapping of x(t) on the t − f plane.
Given a set of (generally complex-valued) functions y(t, t′, f ), of characteristic fre-
quency f , localized in the vicinity of time t′, the linear functional projection (2)
is:

a(t, f ) =

x(t′) y∗(t, t′, f ) dt′

T

The graph of the power a2(t, f ) on the t − f plane is oftenly called scalogram. The
total spectrum:

p(f ) =

a2(t, f ) dt

is expected to generally exhibit similar features and shape (e.g.
slope) as the corresponding Fourier spectrum (equ. (5)).

2.5 Windowed Fourier transform

In the windowed Fourier transform (Gabor, 1946) the Fourier plain wave functions
are modulated by a ’support’ φ (often called ’window’ function) of signiﬁcant value
only in the vicinity σ of time t′:

(9)

)2σ2

−(f −f
2

Its Fourier transform has spectral width of the order of 1/σ. Therefore, the t − f
plane is resolved in cells of ﬁxed shape and area at least σ by 1/σ.
A commonly used support function is a Gaussian of width σ:

The resulting analysing function (9) has Fourier transform:

The Gaussian support can be proven to give optimal localization in the sense that
among all functions it covers smallest area permitted by the uncertainty principle
in the time-frequency plane (Louis et al., 1997). Other window functions are also
used, aimed at reducing the leakage of power of spectral peaks to nearby frequencies
(e.g. Press et al., 1992).

However the windowed Fourier transform always introduces the arbitrary dura-
tion of the support function (σ in equ. (10)) which itself does not depend on f and
must be selected appropriately before the analysis. Also, the analyzing functions y
are not self-similar since include increasingly many oscillations within their support
with increasing frequency.

2.6 Continuous wavelet transform

The continuous wavelet transform resolves the information on the t−f plane in cells
of variable shape depending on frequency, with size of the order of 1/f by f . With
this partition of the t−f plane the arbitrary selection of the windowed Fourier trans-
form is avoided and the analyzing functions (wavelets) are exactly self-similar (or else
scale-invariant) since each includes a constant number of oscillations independent of
frequency. The wavelet transform at lower frequencies provides better resolution in
frequency but worse in time (since the analysing functions are wider) and at high
frequencies better time localization (since the analysing functions are narrower) but
more uncertainty in frequency, in all acting as a ’mathematical microscope’.

While many wavelet families are so far proposed (also depending on the nature
of application), of the most commonly used in physical applications is the Mor-
let wavelet (Morlet et al., 1982), being the generalization of the windowed Fourier
transform (see equ. (9)):

3 The two wavelet skeleton spectra

3.1 Signal-noise decomposition:

Successful decomposition of the timeseries into ’signal’ and noise-like component is
of fundamental importance in various applications, for the separate study of the
signal and noise properties (e.g. locating spectral peaks and deriving scaling laws),
denoising, compression etc. The wavelet transform is promising for that decompo-
sition, since allowing monitoring of the evolution of time-localized wavepackets of
speciﬁc frequency, hence also of stable or transient periodicities and noise-like spikes.
The overall wavelet scalogram generally contains a mixture of the signal and
noise characteristics.
Imposing some thresholding logic (e.g. hard or soft level,
trend etc) to the wavelet components (i.e. a type of wavelet band-pass ﬁlter) is
expected to have limited success in the case of strong, auto-correlated noise and/or
weak, transient periodicities. The deeper reason that such ﬁlters have limited success
in those cases is that the selection of the wavelet components that are attributed
to the signal or the noise is to some extend arbitrary, not adaptively taking into
account the information content in the original timeseries.

As commented in section (2.1) for any continuous functional projection, the con-
tinuous wavelet transform is always redundant in both time and frequency, since
mapping the one dimensional information in x(t) on the (two dimensional) t − f
plane. It contains correlations between the wavelet components that do not exist
in the timeseries but is signiﬁcant at those (small) regions and scales where the
wavelet functions cross-correlation is also signiﬁcant. As a consequence, the higher
the achieved resolution (i.e. sampling in frequency), the higher the smoothness of
the resulting spectrogram due to the increased cross correlations between wavelet
amplitudes at nearby frequencies. The presence of noise-like components, e.g. due
to observational noise, contaminates (’blurs’) the scalogram, by making more un-
correlated wavelet amplitudes of nearby times and introducing ridges across wide
ranges of frequencies.

SIGNAL-NOISE DECOMPOSITION: APPLICATION TO SUNSPOTS

8

In contrast to the continuous, the discrete wavelet transform (the review of which
is outside the scope of this article) leads to uncorrelated wavelet amplitudes if the
discrete wavelet analysing functions are orthogonal. However the lack or redundancy
is not an advantage for the signal-noise decomposition, since there is no profound cri-
terion for attributing the wavelet components to signal or to noise. Some threshold-
ing criterion can be imposed, as commonly used in signal compression applications,
again having a degree of arbitrariness.

From the above discussion emerges a plan for an eﬃcient signal-noise decompo-

sition using the continuous wavelet transform, consisted of the following steps:

(a) Continuous wavelet transform of the timeseries with suﬃciently high fre-
quency resolution (sampling), thus producing a highly redundant wavelet scalogram.
(b) A non-parametric, information dependent selection criterion that disposes
eﬀectively the redundancy, in a way that selects separately those wavelet components
that can be with high probability attributed to signal and to those to noise.

3.2 Scale maximal wavelet skeleton spectrum

A transient structure or burst of ﬁnite, characteristic duration τ , occurring (i.e.
having center of mass) in the timeseries at time t is expected to cause a local increase
of the amplitudes |a(t, f )| of the timeseries wavelet transform in the vicinity of time
t, at wavelet period of the order of τ (or else frequency 1/τ ), while can extent
across diﬀerent timescales, e.g. a discontinuity (τ = 0) is wavelet-transformed to a
superposition of wavelets with the same center of mass at time t, at all timescales
(and frequencies).

For the study of such structures the scale maximal wavelet skeleton spectrum is
extracted from the overall wavelet spectrum, keeping only those wavelet components
of which the complex amplitude is locally maximum across time at any given time-
scale, i.e. those for which:

∂|a(t, f )|
∂t

= 0,

∂2|a(t, f )|
∂t2

< 0

(15)

It is already recognized that the so deﬁned spectrum (otherwise called wavelet trans-
form modulus maxima) contains all the important information about the existence
of hierarchies of discontinuities, usually appearing as continuous lines across scales
pointing at the time of the discontinuity, hence can be used for detection of singu-
larities (e.g. Mallat, 1999, p. 176), or even approximate reconstruction of timeseries
(e.g. Mallat, 1999, p. 185 and references therein). It is also used for the study scal-
ing (e.g. possible multifractal) properties in timeseries: the lines of each singularity
is often, at least at high frequencies, consisted of wavelet amplitudes that follow
power-law dependence on frequency across many orders of frequency range (i.e. for
these ranges there is no characteristic scale, or else there is some scale-invariance
in the timeseries), well modeled by multifractals: If the timeseries is a realization
of a multifractal then the wavelet amplitudes of the locally scale-invariant skeleton

SIGNAL-NOISE DECOMPOSITION: APPLICATION TO SUNSPOTS

spectrum, at least at high frequencies, f → +∞, follow power-law of the form (for
a review see e.g. Arneodo et al., 1995):

|a(t, f )| ∝ f −h(t)
where h(t) is the H¨older (or else local Hurst) exponent, being a local measure of
’burstiness’ in the timeseries at time t (for details see e.g. Muzy et al., 1993).

(16)

Power-law spectral power dependance over frequency, at least over several orders
of frequency magnitude and especially tails at high frequencies (or small scales) are

has the same value for all t. Of speciﬁc interest is the case of 1/f noise (i.e. with
h = 0), constituting the hallmark of self-organized criticality, (SOC, Bak et al.,
1987) i.e. the meta-stable state close to a critical point of a universal class of systems
characterized by intermittency, well modeling aspects of solar ﬂares, earthquakes,
geological formation, biological evolution, economy etc. (for a review see Bak, 1996).

3.3

Instantly maximal wavelet skeleton spectrum

A transient or stable periodic component of instant period T at time t in the time-
series is expected to cause increase of the wavelet amplitudes |a(t, f )| in the vicinity
of wavelet period of the order of T (or else frequency 1/T ), while may extend across
time as far as its period T remains constant in time.

For the detection of periodicities in timeseries here we introduce the instantly
maximal wavelet skeleton spectrum, extracted from the overall wavelet spectrum, if
keeping only those wavelet components that are locally of maximum amplitude at
a given time, i.e. only those for which:

∂|a(t, f )|
∂f

= 0,

∂2|a(t, f )|
∂f 2

< 0

(17)

From the above discussion becomes clear that the so deﬁned spectrum can be used
for detecting transient periodicities of varying period, and of course those of stable
period in the timeseries. Note that the instantly maximal skeleton spectrum excludes
the wavelet components that instantly extend across time scales, thus it is less
contaminated by the noise-like scale-invariant component of the timeseries. On the
other hand, the scale maximal spectrum includes only those wavelet components that
extend across time scales, thus the scaling properties derived from it are not distorted
by possible transient periodicities in the timeseries due to the presence of components
of analog signal type. In that sense the two skeleton spectra are complementary,
permitting the separate study of the noise-like and signal-like timeseries component
properties separately. Noise-like components of an hierarchy of discontinuities also
aﬀects strongly the complex phases, arg(a(t, f )), of the wavelet spectrum since the
wavelet expansion requires ’synchronization’ of wavelets (i.e. to be placed nearby in
time). For this reason only the wavelet amplitudes are considered in (17). However,
auto-correlated random noise has signiﬁcant slowly varying components, i.e. non-
periodic trends at various scales (and in that sense the two skeleton spectra do

SIGNAL-NOISE DECOMPOSITION: APPLICATION TO SUNSPOTS

10

not completely separate signal from noise), nevertheless introducing a power-law
background without concentration of power in spectral peaks. In all, the instantly
maximal skeleton spectrum is expected to exhibit more clearly the periodicities of
a signal-like component of timeseries, practically excluding uncorrelated hierarchies
of discontinuities due to noise.

4 Application to the sunspot index

4.1 A review on solar activity and sunspots

The solar activity (e.g. sunspots, ﬂares, coronal mass ejections etc) is rich, involving
complex, not well understood magnetoﬂuid processes, extending in a wide range of
spatial scales and durations. The sunspot number is widely regarded as an easily
collectable quantitive solar activity measure. Sporadic, naked-eye observations exist
in Chinese dynastic histories since 28 BC, while systematic sunspot observations are
kept since the discovery of telescope in 1610, while not uniformly reliable (Waldmeier
1961, Eddy, 1977, Sonett 1983).

The sunspot number is dominated by the 11-year periodicity (well-known Schwabe
in 1843) connected to the 22-year cycle of the overall solar magnetic ﬁeld. The 11-
year cycle is stable, exhibiting only small variations of each cycle duration, as also
shown using wavelet analysis of sunspot number (Fligge et al., 1999). However, the
maximum number of sunspots in each cycle varies signiﬁcantly and quite unpre-
dictably, even nearly, but not totally, vanishing for many cycles. In all, the sunspot
record includes enigmatic epochs of suppression, as the Maunder Minimum from
1645 to 1715 (e.g. Ribes & Nesme-Ribes, 1993) and Sp¨orer Minimum in the 15th
century, as well as epochs of enhanced activity, as the nowadays Modern Maximum
and Medieval Maximum in the 12th century. The reason for the large variations of
the cycle’s amplitudes and the epochs of suppressed activity of Maunder minimum
type is unclear, e.g. proposed being due to chaotic behaviour of the nonlinear dy-
namo equations (e.g. Ruzmaikin, 1983, K¨uker et al., 1999) or due to stochastic
instabilities forcing the solar dynamo leading to on-oﬀ intermittency (e.g. Hoyng,
1988, 1993, Ossendrijver & Hoyng, 1996, Schmitt et al., 1996).

The average shape of each sunspot cycle is systematically asymmetric, taking
less time rising to maximum than reaching the next minimum, implying that the
solar cycle is intrinsically non-linear (e.g. Veselovski & Tarsina, 2002). Probably the
most signiﬁcant relation between the cycle shape characteristics is the Waldmeier
eﬀect: cycles with larger amplitudes are more asymmetric, taking less time to reach
maximum (e.g. Hathaway, et al., 1994, Li, 1999, Veselovski & Tarsina, 2002). That
the 11-year oscillation is not harmonic has an important implication: it introduces
inﬁnite number of spectral peaks (harmonics) with periods 11/n years, n = 2, 3, ...
(e.g. Polygiannakis et al., 1996, Mursula et al., 1997). All those general features
were successfully described by a simpliﬁed mono-parametric Van der Pol non-linear
RLC oscillator model, further shown to accurately reproduce the observed sunspot

SIGNAL-NOISE DECOMPOSITION: APPLICATION TO SUNSPOTS

11

record and extended epochs of suppressed activity, given the maximum of each cycle
(Polygiannakis et al., 1996).

Systematic search for periodicities other than the basic 11-year in sunspot num-
ber, solar activity indices and, consequently, in the interplanetary, geomagnetic,
earth rotation ﬂuctuations and climate parameters lead to numerous claims, also
depending on the nature of the analyzed parameter (as regarding its sensitivity to
the solar activity periodicities), the periodicity detection method and the ﬁnite size
of the records:

(a) Periodicities longer than 11 years, such as 180 years, 90 years (’Gleiseberg
cycle’), 45 and 22 years (e.g. Cohen & Lintz, 1974, Sonnet 1982), perhaps subhar-
monics (i.e.
integer multiples) of the basic 11-year periodicity, and several others
(Norderman & Trivedi, 1992), intended to describe the long-term modulation of
the sunspot cycle amplitudes as periodic, in contrast to the chaotic or stochastic
theoretical scenarios discussed above.

(b) 11-year periodicity harmonics, namely of 5.5 (FYO, ﬁve-year oscillation) and
3.7 years in sunspot number, other solar activity and solar-terrestrial connection
parameters as the geomagnetic ﬁeld and earth rotation disturbances (e.g. Currie,
1976, Courtillot & Le Mouel, 1976, Suguira, 1980, Carta et al., 1982, Kondor, 1993,
Djurovic & Paquet, 1996, Mursula et al., 1997, Nayar et al., 2002).

(c) Numerous shorter periodicities of transient character, detected over one or
few 11-year cycles, with most frequently appearing in bibliography the 2-year (QBO,
quasi-biennial) oscillation in sunspot number (Shapiro & Ward, 1962, Apostolov,
1985), solar radio ﬂux (Hughes & Kesteven, 1981), solar magnetic helicity (Bao
& Zhang, 1998), other solar activity, solar-terrestrial connection and atmospheric
parameters and earth rotation rate (e.g. Chao, 1989, Djurovic & Paquet, 1993,
Kane, 1997). Oftenly discussed are also periodicities of 154, 129, 103, 77, 51 days
in solar ﬂare occurrence and sunspot area (Riegel et al., 1984, Bogard & Bai, 1985,
Dennis, 1985, Kile & Cliver, 1991, Bai & Surrock, 1991, Carbonel & Ballester, 1992).
The 11-year sunspot (equivalently, 22-year solar magnetic) cycle phenomenon,
is now believed to be due to a magneto-hydrodynamic dynamo action, periodically
regenerating the solar magnetic ﬁeld at the basis of the convection zone. The cause
and importance of periodicities other than the 11-year remain so far unclear. The
periodicities of 154, 129, 103, 77, 51 days were proposed to be subharmonics of a
25.5 days fundamental periodicity of some ’clock mechanism’ in the sun, modeled
by an oblique rotator, (Bai & Surrock, 1991, Sturrock & Bai, 1992). Alternatively it
was proposed that the 154-day periodicity and others can be related to the normal
modes of the solar interior oscillations (Wolﬀ, 1983, 1992). The source of the QBO
may be connected with periodic poleward streams of magnetic ﬂux, ﬁrst discussed
by Howard and LaBonde (1981). Based on magnetic helicity observations (Bao &
Zhang, 1998), it was proposed a double-cycle solar magnetic dynamo model, with one
dynamo operating at the basis of the convection zone (11-year cycle) due to radial
shear and the other at the top of the convection zone (with 2-year periodicity) due
to latitudal shear (Benevolenskaya, 1998, 2000). Also supporting this model, further
analysis of the solar magnetic ﬁeld data showed that the active region magnetic ﬁeld

SIGNAL-NOISE DECOMPOSITION: APPLICATION TO SUNSPOTS

12

exhibits an intense, short-scale component varying with 2-year periodicity (Erofeev,
2001). It was also proposed that the sunspot number can be well ﬁtted by a super-
position of the usual 11-year cycles and wave trains with periodicity continuously
varying from 38 months at solar maximum, to 21 months towards solar minimum
(Krasotkin, 2001).

The sunspot number and all other solar activity parameters also exhibit non-
periodic intense ﬂuctuations that should be attributed to the episodic character
of short-timescale solar phenomena. The solar magnetic ﬁeld on the photosphere
exhibits complex organization and sudden, intermittent energy emissions as the solar
ﬂares, in all well modeled as if the solar corona is in a self-organized critical state
(SOC). The corresponding cellular automata models are in good agreement with the
observed power-law distributions of ﬂare released energy and occurrence rate (e.g.
Dennis, 1985, Lu & Hamilton, 1991, Lu et al., 1993, Georgoulis & Vlahos, 1998,
Isliker et al., 2000, 2001, Anastasiadis, 2002). The emergence of a ﬂare drastically
reorganizes the magnetic ﬁelds in solar active regions, hence is expected to aﬀect
the underlying sunspot and active region lifetimes, thus leaving an imprint of a,
characteristic of SOC, 1/f tail at high frequencies in all the solar-activity related
parameters, as the here considered sunspot index.

From the timeseries point of view the sunspot number record provides a good
example of mixture of, both stable and transient, periodicities of signiﬁcantly varying
amplitudes and of high-frequency, noise-like components (e.g. Watari, 1996). From
the physical point of view it promises to provide useful information about the, not
completely understood, nature of the solar activity, as connected to the overall solar
magnetic ﬁeld regeneration mechanism and, at smaller timescales, the generation of
active, transient solar phenomena, such as ﬂares and coronal mass ejections.

4.2 Wavelet spectra of sunspot index

For this application we the record of 2048 recent monthly sunspot number timeseries
extending from June 1831 to February 2002, compiled from the SIDC RWC Belgium
World Data Center for the Sunspot Index catalogues. The number of points was
selected being a power of 2 in order to avoid edge eﬀects in the fast Fourier transforms
used to derive the wavelet scalograms, thus also omitting the record before 1830
which are of questionable reliability (e.g. Sonett 1983). The use of monthly-averaged
numbers excludes eﬀects related to the solar diﬀerential rotation, with period of 27
days at the solar equator, and the time-life of each sunspot, persisting for one or for
a few solar rotations.

The wavelet transform was calculated using the Morlet wavelet (equ.

(13)),
ﬁltering the timeseries for each wavelet scale in the frequency domain for N = 100
total wavelet periods, sampled logarithmically between the minimum sampling time
(1 month) and the total timeseries duration (2048 months) and then inverse Fourier
transforming it in the time domain (power theorem, see (6)). Note that the total
number of period samples, N, used to derive the wavelet scalogram is arbitrary,
depending on the information content in the record (deﬁning the complexity of the

SIGNAL-NOISE DECOMPOSITION: APPLICATION TO SUNSPOTS

13

scalogram). Too large N may lead to mode splitting eﬀects and too small to poorly
sampled scalogram. Generally, selecting N being of the order of 1/10 of the total
number of points in the timeseries (here 2048) gives satisfactory results. For a review
on continuous wavelet transform and the details of the related numerical techniques
used to derive the wavelet scalogram, see Torrence & Compo (1998). Once the
wavelet scalogram is calculated it is parsed twice, once across time at each scale and
once across scales for each time instance, testing successive triads of amplitudes and
keeping only the locally maximal, thus obtaining the two skeleton scalograms.

In ﬁgure 1(a) we present the monthly-averaged sunspot index. The well-known
11-year periodicity and the asymmetry of each cycle are prominent. Also, the ﬂuc-
tuations of the index are larger near each cycle’s maximum.

In ﬁgure 1(b) the corresponding wavelet scalogram is shown. Notice the stable
11-year periodicity, having nearly constant period with time. The spectrum is rich
in higher-frequency components too, and the intensity of higher frequencies is larger
at cycle’s maxima, since the ﬂuctuations are more intense there. Note that there is
some arbitrarily in the image of the scalogram (as this applies to the representation of
any wavelet scalogram and more generally time-frequency distribution), in the sense
that appropriate color or grey scales must be attributed to the range of wavelet
amplitudes, resulting in visually richer or poorer images.

The two skeleton scalograms, extracted from the overall wavelet one, are shown
in ﬁgures 1(c) and 1(d). In the locally scale-invariant spectrum it can be noticed that
the lines of maxima proceed towards larger periods at the cycle’s maxima, since they
represent the center of each cycle as an overall structure. The instantly maximal
skeleton spectrum clearly shows the 11-year periodicity as a nearly horizontal line
and others, also quite stable. Periodicities of about 22-years are also prominent,
probably being sub-harmonics of the 11-year one. Near the period of 1 year the
periodicities appear having signiﬁcant evolution with time, lasting for many decades
(several cycles). The periodicities of smaller periods seem becoming increasingly
unstable and intermittent (i.e. the lines have more and more gaps), probably due
to their small amplitude, and the presence of self-similar noise-like ﬂuctuations.

The total wavelet power of the overall and the two skeleton spectra is shown in
ﬁgure 2. The main spectral peaks are indicated with arrows, noting the correspond-
ing period in years. On the ﬁrst column of table 1 we give the period of each of
these peaks. The corresponding period error estimates represent the width between
successive wavelet periods, as sampled to derive the wavelet transform (equ. (13)).
The overall wavelet spectrum is poor, exhibiting only few spectral peaks, namely
at the 11, 5.5, 2 and 1 year, and an 1/f tail at periods smaller than 1-year. However,
the instantly maximal skeleton spectrum exhibits several spectral peaks, and this
veriﬁes its value: apart from the dominant 11-year periodicity, 3 of its harmonics,
expected due to the 11-year cycle rise-fall asymmetry, with periods 11/n, n = 2, 3, 4
(i.e. 5.5, 3.67 and 2.75 years) and rapidly decreasing amplitudes at shorter periods
are also prominent. The weaker peaks of 16, 13 and 8.8 years seem related with the
main 11-year periodicity, probably being a mode-splitting eﬀect. The long, 28, 24
and 19 year periodicities are probably due to mode-splitting of a 22-year periodicity,

SIGNAL-NOISE DECOMPOSITION: APPLICATION TO SUNSPOTS

14

being the main 11-year sub-harmonic, or can be interpreted as modulation eﬀects
of the cycle’s amplitudes (see the discussion for periods longer than 11-years in the
previous section).

At shorter periods, a set of 10 spectral peaks with less rapidly decreasing am-
plitudes (nearly as 1/f with frequency) exists, with periods given in Table 1. Note
that the QBO and the periodicities of 154, 129, 103, 77 days, i.e. 0.42, 0.35, 0.28,
0.21 years (previously reported in various solar activity parameters, as discussed in
the previous section), are recovered.

As discussed in the previous section, according to the ’clock mechanism’ scenario
(Bai & Surrock, 1991, Sturrock & Bai, 1992) the 154, 129, 103, 77 day periodicities
constitute the 6th, 5th, 4th and 3th subharmonics of a 25.5 days fundamental periodic-
ity. However the remaining 6 peaks are not easily explained in a similar way as even
higher subharmonics. The QBO should be the 29th subharmonic of the 25.5 day
periodicity, however the subharmonics in between are not observed in the spectrum.
Alternatively, here we propose that all these periodicities are actually harmonics
of the QBO periodicity, which then itself should be non-harmonic. In table 1 we
present the periodicities found and also those predicted by the hypothesis of only
two non-harmonic fundamental oscillations, of 11 and 2 years. Note that 12 out
of 15 detected spectral peaks, with periods of 11-year and shorter can be explained
solely with this hypothesis. However:

(a) Two of the predicted QBO harmonics, of 0.29 and 0.22 years are not promi-
nent in the spectrum, possibly being merged, due to noise, with the expected 0.33
and 0.2 year peaks respectively.

(b) The expected single spectral peak at 1-year period is wide, extending from
about 0.9 to 1.6 years, within which 3 merged peaks of 0.97, 1.07, 1.4 period are
detectable. Possibly this peak widening is due to evolution of ephemeral, evolving
periodicities (as seen in ﬁg. 1(d)), indicative of transient underlying solar activity, or,
alternatively, the 0.97 and 1.4 year peaks are additional periodicities (independent
of the QBO) of unknown origin.

The scale maximal skeleton spectrum is aﬀected only by the main 11-year pe-
riodicity, appearing as a dominant spectral peak, while at timescales of 1-3 years,
where the main QBO peak resides, the scale maximal spectral power is reduced. At
periods smaller than 1 year the scale maximal spectrum exhibits a plateau of nearly
zero-slope. This power law-behavior at high frequencies is expected from (16) for
Hurst exponent h = 0. The noise-like component in the sunspot index thus exhibits
power-law (scale-invariant) properties characterizing the 1/f noise, supporting the
hypothesis of self-organized criticality (SOC) in the solar activity, previously pro-
posed for the solar ﬂare occurrence, as discussed in the previous section.

The observation that all the spectral peaks at periods of 2 years and shorter,
here proposed to be harmonics of the QBO, have amplitudes decreasing nearly as
1/f with frequency (clearly diﬀerently from the 11-year cycle, the harmonics of
which decay much faster), also emerging in the same frequency range as the 1/f
noise-like component (apart from the 2-year peak itself) indicates a connection of
these oscillations to surface (photospheric) solar activity phenomena, such as the

solar ﬂares. From theoretical point of view this observation again supports the
model of double solar dynamo (Benevolenskaya, 1998, 2000) in which the 2-year
oscillation is due to latitudal shear at the top of the convection zone, hence also the
photosphere. The nature and properties of the surface dynamo producing both the
QBO and intermittent bursts of 1/f -type (SOC), and the coupling with the main
11-year dynamo at the basis of the convection zone is not within the scope of the
present article, yet are to our opinion of great interest for solar physics and deserve
further investigation.

5 Conclusions

We proposed the parallel use of two complementary skeleton spectra, extracted from
the overall continuous wavelet spectrum, that are useful for studying the existence
and evolution of stable or transient periodicities and noise-like components in time-
series. As an indicative physical application, we analyzed the monthly averaged
sunspot index. The results showed:

(a) Clearer spectral peaks in the instantly maximal, compared to the overall,
wavelet spectrum, that can be further attributed to the action of only two non-
harmonic oscillators, namely the well-known 11-year and the 2-year (QBO), sup-
porting the double-cycle solar dynamo model (Benevolenskaya, 1998, 2000).

(b) The existence of a 1/f noise background at timescales of 1 year and shorter,
possibly being an imprint of the previously proposed self-organized critical state
(SOC) of the solar magnetic ﬁelds and the intermittent energy releases, such as
solar ﬂares (e.g. Lu & Hamilton, 1991, Lu et al., 1993).

We hope that the two wavelet skeleton spectra will be further useful in vari-
ous signal processing applications, as data compression, ﬁltering, data ﬁtting and
modeling.

Figure captions

Figure 1. The monthly-averaged sunspot index. (b) The corresponding wavelet
scalogram in grey color scale (whiter color corresponds to larger wavelet amplitudes).
(c) The scale maximal and (d) the instantly maximal wavelet skeleton spectra.

ﬁgure 2. The total wavelet power of the overall (upper curve), the instantly
maximal (middle curve, the period in years of the spectral peaks is also noted) and
scale maximal wavelet skeleton spectra in common, arbitrary units.

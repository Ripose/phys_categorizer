Escape rates in periodically driven Markov processes

Abstract

We present an approximate analytical expression for the escape rate of time-dependent
driven stochastic processes with an absorbing boundary such as the driven leaky integrate-
and-ﬁre model for neural spiking. The novel approximation is based on a discrete state
Markovian modeling of the full long-time dynamics with time-dependent rates. It is valid
in a wide parameter regime beyond the restraining limits of weak driving (linear response)
and/or weak noise. The scheme is carefully tested and yields excellent agreement with three
different numerical methods based on the Langevin equation, the Fokker-Planck equation
and an integral equation.

1 Introduction

Although the solution of the stationary and unbounded Ornstein-Uhlenbeck pro-
cess has been found long ago, it is not yet possible to give an analytic exact ex-
pression that includes time-dependent driving and absorbing boundaries [1,2]. Yet,
such processes with a linear restoring force an a periodic driving which termi-
nate at a prescribed threshold are widely used as models for numerous physical
effects. Examples range from rupturing experiments on molecules [3] where the
time-dependence is introduced as linear movement of the absorbing boundary up
to totally different models like the leaky integrate-and-ﬁre (LIF) model for neuronal
spiking events [4,5,6,7,8]. The latter is the application we primarily think of in this
paper. The stochastic variable stands for the cell soma’s electric potential x(t) that is
changing due to a great many incoming signals from other neurons. It is thus cus-
tomary to employ a diffusion approximation for the stochastic dynamics of x(t).

After ﬁring the process immediately restarts at the instantaneous minimum of the
potential.

The set of eqs. (1–4) deﬁnes our starting point for obtaining the ﬁring statistics of
this driven neuron model. Our main objective is to develop an accurate analytical
approximation that avoids certain restrictive assumptions of prior attempts. Those,
in fact, all involve the use of either of the following limiting approximation schemes
1) [7,9]
such as the limit of linear response theory (i.e. a weak stimulus A
or the limit of asymptotically weak noise [10,11,12,13,14]. Our scheme detailed
below yields novel analytic and tractable expressions beyond the linear response
and weak noise limit; as will be demonstrated, this novel scheme indeed provides
analytical formulae that compare very favorably with precise numerical results of
the full dynamics in eqs. (1, 2–4). The arguments given for the agreement of the
ﬁrst-passage time distribution also hold for the residence-time [15] which is not
further considered here.

2 Reduction to a discrete model

The periodicity of the external driving with the period T = 2π/ω allows one to rep-
resent the time-dependent solution ρ(x, t) of the Fokker Planck equation in terms
of Floquet eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the Fokker-Planck operator, vi(x, t)

2

and µi, respectively, [10,16]

∂
∂t

−

vi(x, t) + L(t)vi(x, t) = µivi(x, t),

where the eigenfunctions are periodic in time, integrable in x from
fulﬁll the absorbing boundary condition at x = a

−∞

to a, and

vi(a, t) = 0.

The time-dependent PDF can be written as a weighted sum of the Floquet eigen-
functions

ρ(x, t) =

ci vi(x, t) exp(µit)

Xi

where the coefﬁcients ci are determined by the initial PDF. Note that because of the
absorbing boundary condition at x = a the total probability is not conserved and
therefore all Floquet eigenvalues have a non-vanishing negative real part.

The ﬁrst main assumption that we impose concerns the value of the potential at
the boundary: The minimum of the potential must always belong to the “allowed”
region left of the threshold, and, moreover, the potential difference between thresh-
old and minimum, denoted by ∆U(t), must always be larger than at least a few D,
i.e. ∆U(t)/D > 4. This assumption implies an exponential time-scale separation
between the average time τκ in which the threshold is reached from the minimum
of the potential compared to the time τr of the deterministic relaxation towards the
potential minimum. In the dimensionless units used here τr = 1. For the Floquet
spectrum this implies the presence of a large gap between the ﬁrst eigenvalue µ1
1/τκ and the higher ones which are of the order
which is of the same order as
1 or smaller. After a short initial time of the order 1, all contributions from higher

−
Floquet eigenvalues can be neglected and only the ﬁrst one survives:

In general, the Floquet eigenfunctions and the corresponding eigenvalues are difﬁ-
cult to determine. A formal expansion in terms of the instantaneous eigenfunctions
ψi(x, t) of L(t) fulﬁlling

is always possible though not always helpful

L(t)ψk(x, t) = λk(t)ψk(x, t)

vi(x, t) =

dik(t)ψk(x, t).

Xk

The periodicity of vi(x, t) and ψk(x, t) implies that the coefﬁcients dik(t) also are
periodic functions of time. Expansion (10), together with the Floquet equation (5),
yields a coupled set of ordinary differential equations for the coefﬁcients dik(t) [17]

est, namely the PDF for the ﬁrst-passage time (FPT) of the attracting ”integrating”

3 Numerical analysis

We implemented three different numerical methods to obtain both the FPT-PDF
and the rate in order to have a reliable basis for comparison with the analytical ex-
pression (21). The ﬁrst method performs explicit time-steps of the Langevin equa-
tion (1). We used an elaborate technique for the time-integration of the ﬂuctuating
force ξ(t). For points away from the threshold a it is sufﬁcient to take a normal
distributed random variable for the displacement due to ξ(t). Quite the contrary in
the vicinity of the absorbing boundary. Here, the integral of ξ(t) rather behaves like
a Wiener process with absorbing boundary, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The appropriate
transition distribution, is known analytically as the weighted difference between
two normal distributions [1]

The multiplication on the right-hand side stands for a logical AND that leads to a
correction step in the algorithm. First, a new position xi+1 is proposed according

5

to the normal distribution density N1. With the probability Pout(xi+1, xi, δt) the
trajectory has already crossed the boundary during this time-step δt from xi to xi+1
and, therefore, is to be ended. The explicit forms of N1 and N2 give

The same formula has been given by [19] but with a different reasoning.

In order to get the correctly normalized FPT-PDF g(t) we counted the number of
trajectories hitting the absorbing boundary within the interval [t, t + δt). The FPT-
PDF is then estimated by this number divided by δt and by the total number of
trajectories. The rate is given by

κ(t) = g(t)/P (t),

For the second numerical method we have solved the FP equation (2) using a
Chebychev collocation method to reduce the problem to a coupled system of or-
dinary differential equations [13,20]. This gives P (t) as the integral of ρ(x, t) from
to a. The FPT-PDF in the ﬁgures is then calculated according to eq. (23), and

−∞
the rate again by (26).

The third method solves Ricciardi’s integral equation for the FPT-PDF and is de-
tailed in [21,22]. For employing his algorithm the process must be transformed into
a stationary Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with a moving absorbing boundary

All three methods provide practically identical results as can be seen in Figs. 2 and
3. The results for the FPT-PDF and for the rate all collapse into one single line.
Differences between the numerical methods, e.g. ﬂuctuations in the histogram of
the Langevin equation method are visible only in the plots of the relative errors
(Fig. 3 middle and lower rows).

Figure 2 shows that the FPT-PDF is extremely well approximated by expression
(21) for the rate κ(t). In the left plots we used quite a high barrier with quite slow
driving compared to the time-scale τr of the process. Good agreement is thus ex-
pected. In the right plots we show the situation with extreme parameters. The lower
barrier height ∆Umin/D goes down to 3 where a rate-description is unlikely to suf-
ﬁce. Moreover, the driving is faster, ω = 0.5. The system cannot follow the driving
instantaneously, and we ﬁnd a shift in the maximum of the FPT-PDF to later times.
Under these conditions it is impressing how good the novel approximation still
works.

A more delicate measure for the errors of the approximation are the rate κ(t) itself
and its relative deviation from the three numerically calculated rates. Both can be
seen in Fig. 3. The upper row of plots shows the approximation error of the rate
for the same two parameter sets as in Fig. 2. Especially at the maximum the rate
is over-estimated. This leads to a faster decay of the FPT-PDF which is scarcely
visible in Fig. 2. Also, the shift of the maxima (indicated by vertical lines) can be
observed. It is negligibly small for ω = 0.05 but more pronounced for ω = 0.5.

In the middle row of Fig. 3 a systematic error of the approximation becomes vis-
ible. The relative error with respect to the numerical results behaves roughly si-
nusoidally with a phase-shift of π/2 relative to the driving and with an additional
constant offset. For the instantaneous rate expression (19) to be valid it is neces-
sary that the driving signal is sufﬁciently slow. If this assumption is violated then
a rate can still be deﬁned if the barrier is sufﬁciently high. But in addition to the

7

leading term d11(t) in (10) the higher instantaneous eigenfunctions must be taken
into account. The coupling to the coefﬁcients d1k(t) is induced by the matrix ele-
ments
, see eq. (11), containing a time derivative that introduces non-
adiabatic corrections to the rate and, consequently, to the statistics of the FPT.

It is quite astonishing, that the huge relative error in the right middle plot of Fig. 3
leads to such a good result in Fig. 2. The explanation for this is that the FPT-
PDF (23) uses the time-integrated rate. Therefore, errors are important only where
the rate is large. A closer look on the plot shows that around the maxima of the rate
the relative error is comparably small. Because the errors are linear in time around
the rate’s maxima they cancel out when integrated over time in (23). The same is

valid for the residence time whose PDF also contains integrals of the rate [15,23].

Figure 4 shows this relative error of κ(t) at the maxima of the numerically obtained
rate as a function of the barrier height. Again, two different driving frequencies are
given. In both cases the relative error has the same order of magnitude, and thus
explains why both parameter sets in Fig. 2 yield good approximations.

Finally, we would like to point the reader’s attention to the limitations of the linear
response approximation. For linear response the parameter ratio A/D needs to be
small. In our validating example in Fig. 2 (left plots) it takes on the value A/D =
1.5. Thus, our approximation scheme is valid beyond the linear response limit.

The time-scale of the driving force is mainly restricted by the relaxation time-
scale τr and much less by the magnitude of the rate itself. There is no restriction
on the relative magnitudes of κ and T . Instead, both ω and κ have to be sufﬁciently
small. Fig. 5 indicates that both the relative error and the time-shift of the maxima’s
positions are modest for ω < 0.1.

4 Conclusions

By reference to a discrete Markovian dynamics for the corresponding full space-
continuous stochastic process we succeeded in obtaining an analytical approxima-
tion for the time-dependent escape rate which can be used for calculating ﬁrst-
passage time statistics. This result is valid beyond the restraining limits of linear
response or asymptotically weak noise and of adiabatically slow driving.

We checked our ﬁndings using simulations of the Langevin equation (1) and nu-
merical solutions of the equivalent FP equation in (2) and of the integral equation
in [21]. We found an impressive agreement for the ﬁrst-passage time density and a
good match for the rate which is the more delicate property for comparison.

Finally, we note that our method is not restricted to a periodic forcing but applies
also to arbitrary drive functions. However, in the oscillatory case some of the ap-
proximation errors cancel out. This leads to useful results in extreme parameter
regimes where agreement cannot be expected a priori.

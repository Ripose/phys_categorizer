Abstract

We show that the simulation process used so extensively in the exact sci-
ences may be described by the Parisi-Wu stochastic quantization version of
the Langevin equation in which the extra variable may take account of the
programming mechanism. We also describe it using the Ursell-Mayer cluster
formalism of Statistical Physics. As an example we take the Internet web sites
formation upon the computer screen

I. INTRODUCTION

The problem of validating scientiﬁc theories through numerical simulations has been
discussed from several points of view [1–3]. There is now almost no scientist (physicist,
chemist, biologist etc) that does not use the powerful means of numerical simulations as a
necessary aid in his research. Moreover, it is accepted [2,3] that if some scientiﬁc theory
is found in its computer simulated form to be valid on the screen then generally it is valid
also outside it. The simulating process is sharply divided into two chronologically ordered
parts: the ﬁrst is writing the relevant software and the second running it on the screen.
The content of the written software depends exclusively upon the writer of it which actually
can write anything, so long as he does not deviate from the syntactic rules dictated by the
computer language he uses. Thus, compared to any real process which generally has one
ﬁnal outcome the programming one is unique in that the ﬁnal result shown on the screen is
arbitrary and may be anything dependent upon the relevant software. Since the outcome of
any simulation process is the resulting two-dimensional form shown on the computer screen
we take this form as the basic variable and ﬁnd how its spatial-time dependence changes on
the screen due to changes of the software source.

In order to be speciﬁc we take the example of the Internet web and note that there has
been research that discuss the Internet topology [4] and among other things also its resilience
under intentional attack [5]. Use has been made of the fractal [6,7] and the percolation
theories [8,9] and the Internet web sites are regarded as its building blocks. These works
discuss the Internet as random network [7,8] without considering the nature of its constituent
sites.

We focuse in this work our attention on the sites themselves and take into account
their unique nature compared to that of any other fractal as will be explained in Section
4. Moreover, whereas any other fractal is built by repeated iteration (see Aharony in [8])
of some unique natural ”microscopic” growth rule, the case of the Internet is diﬀerent since
not only the forms of the constituent sites, the identity and connectivity [7–9] of their links
depend only on the programs writers (and not upon any natural rule) but also the growth
of the web itself depends exclusively upon them. To be more exact, each speciﬁc software
source constitutes the ”natural law” that governs the formation on the screen of the speciﬁc
web site related to it. Thus, we must take into account this unique character of programming
that enables one to simulate on the two dimensional screen anything compared to physical
evolutions that generally end in a single outcome and so may be simulated on the computer
screen by only a speciﬁc software source.

Now, to mathematically express any natural law that determines one speciﬁc process
one needs no more variables than those necessary for specifying the time and space axes.
But for discussing the possibilities hidden in the software scripting we need an extra variabe
denoted here by s that takes account of its generalization. We note that similar situations
arise in the functional discussion of some mathematical [10] and physical [11] situations for
which one have to add another special variable that takes account of this functionality (see,
for example, the functional generalization [12] of Quantum Mechanics where one have to
discuss a more general Hilbert space (the Lax-Phillips one [11]) obtained by adding extra
variable to the conventional Hilbert space). A similar generalization, used here in Sections
2-3, of adding an extra variable to the Langevin equation [13] has been proposed and termed

2

stochastic quantization (SQ) by Parisi and Wu [14] and expanded further by Namiki [15] to
cover also constrained systems and nonperturbative methods. The SQ theory assumes that
some stochatic process [16] occurs in the extra dimension and that the physical laws and
expressions are obtained from those involving it in the limit when all its values are set equal
to each other and taken to inﬁnity. Quantum Mechanics is obtained as a special case as will
be shown. This formalism is suitable to our discussion in Sections 2-3 in which the extra
variable takes account of the large possibilities of the software process which depends, as
pointed out, exclusively upon its writer’s wishes and so may be represented by a stochastic
process [16] in the variable s. Moreover, the operator formalism and especially the creation
and annihilation ones are especially appropriate for describing the programming mechanism
through which the programmer actually creates or annihilates at his will any form on the
computer screen. Note that quantum methods and operators, especially for creation and
annihilation, have been found appropriate to discuss even classical phenomena (see, for
example, [15,17,18]).

As known, any web site contains one or more web pages and each of these may include
one or more links to other places on the same page or to other sites or other web servers.
The user that clicks, through the keyboard, on any link downloads its relevant site to the
screen. The number of the links in a web site may be small (or even zero for the unlinked
web sites) or it may be very large in which case the relevant site is densely linked. Each
site together with all the sites obtained by clicking on all its links constitute the information
on some subject. We do not consider here the secondary links that may be found on the
sites referred to by the ﬁrst links. Now, if one wish to obtain some information that may be
found in a speciﬁc web site all he has to do is to click the right address (Unique Resource
Locator - URL) and the relevant site appears on the screen. But suppose that one does not
know the exact address then in this case he may use some search engine that accepts as
its input a word or two related to the wanted information and return, as its output, a list
of addresses (URL’s) of web sites each of which may contain a small or large part of the
sought-for information. In the following we use alternately the terms sites and ﬁles with the
same meaning.

The system we wish to discuss here is a large ensemble of computers that are connected
to the Internet. We assume that these computers act on a sharing peer to peer basis without
diﬀerentiating between servers and clients, so that all the ﬁles of each one are potentially
shared by all of them and any ﬁle of any kind may be downloaded by each one. There
exist in the web dozens of appropriate softwares that enable this kind of sharing and free
downloading of all kinds of ﬁles (for example, the now non-existent Napster.com that enables
all the computers that use its software to free-download music). These softwares, when
activated by any one of the sharing users that searches for a speciﬁc information in any form
(softwares, media ﬁles, video ﬁles etc), suggest a list of possible URL’s that refer to other
users that have this information. The requested ﬁles of any such user may be downloaded
and the uploading one chosen is generally that whith a large rate of downloading that is
connected most of the time to the Internet so that the downloading process will not be
interrupted as usually happens when he disconnects from the web. We show that when the
members of the ensemble are connected to each other in a large cluster then adding to them
even a very small amount of connecting links results in an unproportional strengthening of
their overall connectivity in the sense that each of them is found to have the same ﬁnite

3

group of ﬁles. As will be explained this may be the reason for the fast and overall devastating
eﬀects of the computer viruses.

In Section 2 we show that the process of creating any web site by programming it may
be described, as remarked, by the Parisi-Wu version [14] of the Langevin equation [13]. The
large ensemble of shared computers is discussed using the path integral formalism [19] in
which this Langevin equation is inserted into its action S. In Section 3 we apply the results of
Section 2 to the speciﬁc sites and programs that simulate the harmonic oscillator. In Section
4 we discuss the Internet by the partition function method [20,21]. and its ”conﬁguration
integral” is discussed by adapting the cluster formalism of Ursell [22] and Mayer [23]. The
integrals included in the “conﬁguration integral” are expressed with respect to the variable
s, as always done in the SQ method, remembering that the stationary physical situations
are obtained in the limit when this variable is eliminated from the relevant expressions.
We show that enhancing, even slightly, the overall connectivity [7,8] of some large cluster
of the ensemble results in a very large contribution of this cluster to the “conﬁguration
integral” compared to its contribution without this small connectivity. We show also that
the partition function formalism coincides with the path integral one of Section 2-3. In the
Concluding Remarks section we discuss the repetitive criterion that emerges as a necessary
factor from the discussions in the former sections.

II. REPRESENTATION OF THE SIMULATION PROCESS AS A STOCHASTIC
LANGEVIN EQUATION

As remarked, the forming stage of any web site, depends upon its relevant software, that
is, upon s and its ﬁnal form on the screen may be described using only its time-spatial
coordinates. We note that the time dependence is eﬀective only if the form simulated on
the screen has dynamical attributes, as in the case of video ﬁles, otherwise, the dependence
is only spatial for static sites. Now, since any time-spatial dependence of the sites are
determined by the relevant software sources, that is, by s, the development of these sites,
denoted here by qi, may be expressed as

∂qi(s, t, x)
∂s

= Ki(q(s, t, x)) + ηi(s, t, x),

where the ηi denote the softwaring processes in s that result in the site forms (here x denotes
the two-dimensional plane of the screen in which the web sites are viewed). The Ki are given,
according to the SQ theory, as [14,15]

where the Si[q] denote the relevant actions. Note that Eq (1) is similar to the Langevin
equation [13]

(1)

(2)

(3)

Ki(q(s, t, x) = −(

)q=q(s,t,x),

∂Si[q]
∂q

∂qi(t, x)
∂t

= Ki(q(t, x)) + ηi(t, x),

in which the extra variable s is absent. These equations are the time evolution of
in an n degrees of freedom dy-
stochastic processes of the Wiener-Markoﬀ type [16]
namical system with the variables q(t) = (q1(t), q2(t), . . . qn(t)), and the random forces
η(t) = (η1(t), η2(t), . . . ηn(t)) which denote stochastic processes in the time t. The quan-
tities Ki(q(t, x)) are the drift forces connected to these processes. Generally, these Langevin
equations are supplemented by additional constraints, usually of the Gaussian statistical
ones.

< ηi(t) >= 0, < ηi(t)ηj(t) >= 2αδijδ(t − `t),

or equivalently by

Pηi(y)dy =

which is the probability to ﬁnd a value of ηi in (yi, yi + dy), where

yi =

∂qi(t, x)
∂t

− Ki(qi(t, x)),

(4)

(5)

(6)

and the angular brackets denote an ensemble average over values of η with the Gaussian
distribution. The α from Eq (4) is α = kβT
f , where kβ is the Boltzman constant and f is the
friction constant relevant to the speciﬁc physical situation at hand (T is the temperature in
Kelvin units). The equililibrium conﬁgurations of Eq (1) is obtained, according to the SQ
theory [14,15], when all the values of the extra variables s are equated to each other and
taken to inﬁnity in which case this variable is eliminated from Eq (1) which turns out to
be, in its dependence upon the remaining variables x and t, the same as Eq (2). This is
because the Ki in Eq (1) is not the same as that of Eq (3) (see Eq (2)), thus, as long as the
remarked limit for s is not taken the Ki that depend on s gives rise to all kinds of actions
Si and each of them determines a diﬀerent site qi with a diﬀerent dependence upon t and x.
Thus, we may say that Eq (3) denotes the equilibrium conﬁguration obtained from Eq (1)
when s is eliminated.

We, now, discuss the ”evolution” of the Internet site q(t, s) in the time interval (t0, t) and
the assumed corresponding s interval (s0, s), and divide each of them into N subintervals
(t0, t1), (t1, t2), . . . , (tN −1, t) and (s0, s1), (s1, s2), . . . , (sN −1, s) respectively. At each of these
subintervals the Langevin Eq (1) is satisﬁed together with the assumed Gaussian constraints
[15]

< ηi(tr, sr) >= 0, < ηi(tr, sr)ηj(`tr, `sr) >= 2αδijδ(tr − `tr)δ(sr − `sr),

(7)

where, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n and 1 ≤ r ≤ N (generally one takes n = N). When α = ¯h one obtains
the quantum region in its path integral formalism [19] (see the following Eqs (9)-(10)). The
last constraints may be written equivalently [15] as (see the corresponding Eqs (4)-(5))

Pηi(y)dy =

2(< η >)2 )dyi,

which is the probability to ﬁnd a value of ηi in (yi, yi + dy), where

yi =

− Ki(qi(s, t, x))

As in any ﬁeld theory the Green’s functions ∆ij...(t1, t2, . . .) that determine the correlation
among the members of the ensemble are the important quantities and these are phrased as
[15] path integrals [19]. One may (see [14,15]) deﬁne Green functions which depend also
upon the variable s so

∆ij...(t0, s0, t1, s1, . . .) =< qi(t0, s0)qj(t1, s1) . . .>= C

where, S =
and Lagrangian respectively and S is related to the K(q(t, s)) through Eq (2). Now, if the
s’s in (8) are diﬀerent which means that any member i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) has its speciﬁc action
Si(q(si, t)) and, therefore, diﬀerent Ki(si, t) and ηi(si, t) and diﬀerent websites qi(si, t), the
correlation from Eq (8) is obviously zero. In order to obtain a ﬁnite probability for ﬁnding a
large number of the ensemble each having in its ﬁle system the same ﬁnite group of similar
websites one has to consider the stationary conﬁguration in which the correlation must not
depend upon the extra variable s. Now, since this dependence is through q which means
that the correlation between any two (or more) members i and j of the ensemble is expressed
through their t and s diﬀerences [15], that is, as ∆ij(ti − tj, si − sj) one has to equate, as
done in the SQ theory, all the diﬀerent s values to each other so as to eliminate the variable
s (in the SQ theory one also take the limit of s → ∞; here we obtain elimination of s by
only equating all the s values). In this case, the members of the ensemble have actions S
that may diﬀer from each other only by their time-spatial dependence and so may be similar
to each other as requested. That is, the stationary state of the correlation function from Eq
(8) may be written as

∆ij...(t0, s0, . . .)st =< qi(t0, s0)qj(t1, s1) . . .>st= C

Dq(t)qi(t0)qj(t1) . . . exp(−

Note that the Feynman measure [19] exp(i S(q)
¯h ) is replaced in Eqs (8)-(9) by the Euclidean
one [27] and that C is a normalization constant. Stationarity and with it a ﬁnite group of
websites that may diﬀer only in their time spatial dependence are obtained when similar
versions, from all the diﬀerent possible ones, of the software are taken and this occurs when
all the diﬀerent si are equated to each other as shown on the right hand side of Eq (9).
The allowed S and L are, therefore, the speciﬁc similar Euclidean actions and Lagrangians
related to these speciﬁc site forms on the screen. Note that the remarked sharing property
is taken into account by constraining each path of each member of the ensemble to have an
action S only from the ﬁnite group related to the similar sites. Thus, as remarked, keeping
the same similar versions of the software during all the site forming process results in ﬁnding
the whole ensemble with the same group of similar ﬁles (sites) . In the following section we
specialize our discussion to the speciﬁc S and L of the harmonic oscillator.

III. THE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR EXAMPLE

We apply the results of the previous section to the harmonic oscillator case, that is, we
calculate the probability to ﬁnd the screens of the n shared computers showing the same
group of ﬁles (sites) that refer to the harmonic oscillator assuming that there is a large
number of such sites diﬀering slightly from each other. For that we have to calculate the
correlation function from Eq (8) < qi(t0, s0)qj(t1, s1) . . .>, where qi, qj, . . . represent the sites
occupied by the screens of computers i, j, . . . and we wish to ﬁnd if these sites are correlated
among them, that is, if they belong to the group that contains information on the harmonic
oscillator. We assume that there is a large number of sites, diﬀering slightly from each other,
that refer to the harmonic oscillator. According to Eq (8) the correlation function may be
written as a path integral over all the possible paths of sites that each computer screen is
capable of showing. The relevant time interval (t0, t) in which the system of screens are
watched is assumed to be related to a corresponding s-interval (s0, s) in the extra variable
s. We divide each of these two intervals into N subintervals (t0, t1), (t1, t2), . . . (tN −1, t),
(s0, s1), (s1, s2), . . . (sN −1, s), and discuss ﬁrst the probability P (qk, sk|qk−1, sk−1) that the
system of screens show at the time tk the harmonic oscillator site qk(tk, sk) if at the time
tk−1 they show the site qk−1(tk−1, sk−1), where these sites diﬀer slightly from each other.
When N becomes very large, in which case the remarked subintervals are inﬁnitesimal one
can write the appropriate Langevin equation for the interval (sk−1, sk) as follows [15]

i − qk−1
qk

i − Ki(qk−1)(sk − sk−1) = dηk−1

where Ki is the harmonic oscillator drift force given by

The α is as in (4) and (qk, sk|qk−1, sk−1) may be written, following Eq (5), as

which is the probability that the dηi’s at the right hand side of Eq (10) take the values at
its left hand side and the index i runs over the members of the ensemble. We assume here a
Markov process [16] in which η(s) does not correlate with its history, so that the probability
for the entire interval may be written as [15]

P (qN , sN |q0, s0) =

For V (qi) we may write V (qi) = 1
Eν = w0(ν + 1
as

i as in quantum mechanics, where the eigenvalues are

where ˜qi(κk, sk) and ˜ηi(κk, sk) are the Fourier transforms of qi(tk, sk) and ηi(tk, sk). Solving
Eq (16) one obtain

˜qk
i (κk, sk) = q0 exp(−m((κk)2 + (w0)2)sk) +

exp(−m((κk)2 + (w0)2)(sk − `sk))˜ηi(κk, `sk)d`sk,

m((κk)2 + (w0)2)

exp(iκk(tk − `tk) − m((κk)2 + (w0)2)|sk − `sk|)

The former Eqs (15)-(19) are for the subinterval (sk−1, sk), so generalizing to the entire
interval (s0, sN ), noting that the general correlation function over it Dq(t − t0, s − s0) =<
qi(t0, s0)qj(t1, s1) . . . > is no other than the probability (path integral) P (qN , sn|q0, s0) from

Eq (13) [15], we use the known property of the correlation function (see, for example, [25])

< q1(x1)q2(x2) . . . q2N (x2N >=

From the last property and Eq (19) we may write for the general correlation over all the
members of the ensemble, assumed to be 2N, and over the whole interval subdivided also
into 2N subintervals

Dq(t − t0, s − s0) =< q0(t0, s0)q1(t1, s1) . . . q2N −1(t2N −1, s2N −1) >=

The last exression is, as remarked, the probability that the entire system of computer screens
are occupied at the time t by the harmonic oscillator site q2N −1(t, s) if at the initial time t0
they were occupied by another harmonic oscillator site q0(t0, s0). As noted, the stationary
functions are obtained when all the diﬀerent s are equal to each other, so we obtain from
the last equation.

We see that from the initial large number of diﬀerent possible paths of web sites that begin
at q0 and end at q2N −1 there remains, as remarked in the former section, only those which
are composed along their entire length of only harmonic oscillator sites as seen from the
former equation. The reason is that we have constrained each inﬁnitesimal section of each
one of the possible paths of sites to be constructed only from the same group of similar
sites (that diﬀer by inﬁnitesimal s values) that discuss the harmonic oscillator subject. We
do it by intentionally ﬁxing the dynamical action of each path and along all of its length
to be the harmonic oscillator one in which the corresponding diﬀerential Langevin equation
is substituted (see Eqs (11), (15), (19)) and by equating all the diﬀerent si to each other.
Figure 1 shows the correlation from Eq (21) as a function of t for m = 1 and w0 = 0.4. it
begins from the unity value, proceeds through a maximum and vanishes for large t. In Figure
2 we see a three-dimensional graph of the general correlation from Eq (20) that depends
upon both t and s and for the same values of m and w0 as in Figure 1. Note that for large
s the correlation vanishes even at those values of t at which it attains maximum in the
stationary case of Figure 1. Now, remembering that the path integrals from Eqs (8)-(9) and
(18)-(21) are discussed in the Euclidean formalism in which t is imaginary ordinary time [27]
Eq (21) is almost identical to the correlation relation of the quantum harmonic oscillator
which is [15]

∆quantum(t1 − t0, t3 − t2, . . . t2N −1 − t2N −2) =

From Eq (21) we may proceed one step further and show that any of the remaining harmonic
oscillator paths may be realized so that the probability P (q2N −1, s|q0, s0) to move through

9

all its sites from q0 to q2N −1 is unity which means that each member of the ensemble has
exactly the same sites so that the correlation among them is maximal. This is obtained in
the limit of large N when we may write N = t−t0
2δt , where δt is the duration of each of the
2N subintervals, so that one may assume that for large N all the subintervals (t2k+1 − t2k)
are identical and Eq (21) may be written as

e−N w0δt
(4πmw0)N = (

)N

From the last equation one realizes that the correlation P (q2N −1, s|q0, s0)st is unity when

e−w0δt = 4πmw0,

so that when N is large one may obtain the maximum possible correlation due to the fact
that now even the subintervals of t (in addition to those of s) tend to zero (see Eqs (23)-(24))
so that the sites in the equilibrium stage are almost identical. In such a case, as remarked,
all the members of the ensemble each have exactly the same group of ﬁles (sites) related
to the harmonic oscillator so that the probability to follow any predetermined path of web
sites, from the large number of possible ones all begining at the site q0 and ending at q2N −1,
is unity.

IV. THE INTERNET WEBMASTERING

We see in the previous sections that when the ensemble members have the sharing prop-
erty the probability to ﬁnd each of them having the same ﬁnite group of websites grows.
This may also be shown by adapting for our web sites system the virial expansion of the
equation of state [20,21] which is discussed by using the cluster formalism developed ﬁrst by
Ursell [22] and generalized by Mayer [23]. We assume that the web sites system discussed
here is composed of N sites where N is generally a large number. We note that in Statistical
Mechanics when one discuss the potential energy of the N particle system in the conﬁgura-
tion space [20,21] the relevant variable is the distance rij between any two particles i and j
which depends only on their positions so that the potential between them u(rij) is assumed
to be eﬀective for small ranges of rij and it vanishes when rij grows. Here, also for the N
site system we denote by u(sij) the ”potential” between the two sites i and j which depends
upon the ”distance”, denoted here by sij, between them where this distance signiﬁes how
much these sites diﬀer from each other so that it is shorter the more “similar” they are and
longer for unrelated sites. The distance between i and j may be assigned a quantitative
signiﬁcance by taking into account the number of common links to both so that the more
large this number is the more short this distance is. Thus, each site i is characterized by
all its links so that its ”position” in s space may be written as si(si1, si2, si3, . . .), where, si1,
si2, si3 etc denote the links in i to the sites 1, 2, 3, etc, and the ”distance” between i and j,
for example, may be written as sij(si1, si2, . . . , sj1, sj2, . . .) = si(si1, si2 . . .) − sj(sj1, sj2, . . .).
Thus, we can deﬁne a ”potential” u(sij), in analogy to the N particle system, for example,
as

10

u(sij) =

1
si(si1, si2, . . .) − sj(sj1, sj2, . . .)

(25)

That is, in contrast to the N particle system in which the distance rij between any two
members i and j of it is sharply and uniquely characterized by the positions of these two
members only here the ”distance” between any two sites is also characterized, as has been
remarked, by other links to other sites that are common to both, besides the links that refer
to each other. Moreover, a site may have a link to another one whereas the second have
no link to the ﬁrst in which case the ﬁrst is linked to the second which is not linked to the
ﬁrst. Thus, in order to discuss appropriately the potential between any two sites i and j one
must diﬀerentiate between four diﬀerent situations: 1): i has link to j and j has no one to
i. 2): j has link to i and i has no one to j. 3): both i and j have no links to each other. 4):
both i and j have links to each other in which case the connectivity between them is larger
than in cases 1 and 2. We assume, analogously to the N particle system, that the states of
the N sites system and the correlation among them may be determined from the following
“partition function” [20,21]

Z =

f (s)QN (V (q(s))),

N =∞

XN =0

(26)

(27)

where QN (V (q(s))) is the “conﬁguration integral” in s space given by [20,23]

QN (V ) =

. . .

e−V (q(s))ds1ds2 . . . dsN ,

Z Z

Z

and q(s), as remarked, denotes the possible sites that may be shown on the screen. The
potential V (q(s)) is assumed to be written as a sum of terms each of which depends only on
the “distance” sij between any two sites i and j which denotes, as remarked, the connectivity
between them. Now, since each two sites may be connected to each other in three diﬀerent
ways as in the situations 1, 2, and 4 in the discussion before Eq (26) we get the result that
in a system of N sites there are 3N (N −1)

diﬀerent pairs so that the potential is

The ﬁrst sum takes account of the N(N − 1) pairs that are singly connected to each other
and the second covers the N (N −1)
that are doubly connected and u(sij) is the potential of
the pair of sites i and j as a function of the “distance” between them. Note that the number
of doubly connected pairs is half that of the singly connected ones since a single connection
between any two sites i and j may be realized in two diﬀerent ways (see the situations 1,
and 2 in the former discussion). We deﬁne, as done when discussing the cluster function
theory [22,23,20], the function fij

2

fij = f (sij) = e−u(sij) − 1;

(29)

and note that fij = 0 for a large “distance” sij (unrelated web sites) where u(sij) = 0. Note
that when the sites i and j have no links to each other (unrelated sites) then they, naturally,

11

also have no other common links so that fij and u(sij) are both zero. Also, as one may
imagine the probability to ﬁnd two diﬀerent sites that are entirely identical to each other is
very small so that u(sij) in this case becomes very large (see Eq (25)) such that f (sij) ≈ −1.
By fij we denote also the one-way connection from site i to site j when there is a link in
i to j, and the double connection between them is denoted by fijfji where, obviously, we
have (see Eqs (25) and (29)) fij 6= fji. The “conﬁguration integral” from Eq (27) becomes
using the last equations

In order to be able to cope with the terms in the parentheses sign in Eq (30) we use a
somewhat extended version of the cluster theory developed by [22] and [23] for the imperfect
gas and interacting ﬂuids (see also [20]) in which a one to one correspondence is made between
the terms under the parentheses sign in Eq (30) and certain planar diagrams. For example.
the diagram shown in Figure 3 for N = 24 corresponds to the term in Eq (30) that involves
f1,2, f3,4, f5,6, f9,10, f11,12, f11,19, f12,19, f12,20, f13,20, f15,16, f15,23, f16,23, f16,24, f19,20 and
f23,24. As seen from the diagram the sites (in square parentheses) are assembled in clusters,
so that the sites [7], [8], [14], and [22] each constitutes a single cluster of 1 member. The sites
[1][2], [5][6], and [17] [18] are in clusters of two where the pairs [1][2] and [17][18] are doubly
connected . The sites [3], [4], [9], [10] and [15], [16], [23] and [24] are clusters of 4 where
the members of the ﬁrst are singly connected to each other whereas those of the second
are doubly connected. The sites [11], [12], [13], [19], [20] and [21] constitute a six-member
cluster. As seen the sites in a cluster are connected in a diﬀerent manner to each other
so that one may be doubly connected to all the other sites of the cluster in which case its
connectivity is maximal whereas another may be singly connected to only one site so that
its connectivity is minimal. For example, in the six member cluster of Figure 3 the site [20]
is doubly connected to the sites [11], [12], and [19] and singly connected to [13] and [21],
whereas the sites [13] and [21] are each singly connected to only one site in the cluster [20].
This diﬀerence between the connected sites and the less connected ones is realized when one
remove from the cluster one site and all its connecting lines so that if the removed one is
the densely connected one the connectivity of the remained cluster is weakened considerably
and might even be broken into secondary smaller clusters, whereas if the removed site is
lightly connected the eﬀect on the connectivity of the remaining cluster is less inﬂuental.
For example, if the site [20] and all its connecting lines in the six-member cluster of Figure
3 is removed the cluster is actually broken into three diﬀerent smaller ones whereas if either
the site [13] (or [21]) is removed together with its single connecting line the connectivity of
the remaining 5-member cluster is only slightly weakened. We note that if each member
of some cluster is doubly connected to all the other members of the cluster the obtained
structure may be termed, in analogy to the N-particle system [20], a star graph in which
removing any site from it results with the same degree of connectivity for the remaining
cluster as can be seen in Figure 3 from the four-member cluster composed of the sites [15],
[16], [23] and [24]. Note that when one removes (deletes) a ﬁle (site) or even a directory of
such ﬁles from his overall ﬁle system he does it the same way done for dismantling a fractal.
But when he wants, in a hakerly manner, to perform a computer crime and remove ﬁles of
other users, he does it by appending (not removing since he has no access to their computer

12

account) a new ﬁle (a virus) to their ﬁle systems and this virus may, as will be explained,
damage a large number of ﬁles in a short time.

We denote the number of times an l-sites cluster appears in a term by ml so that the
l=N
l=1 lml. The integral of a term
total number N of all the sites may be written as [23] N =
is the product of the integrals over the sites in the same cluster where the integrals over
the sites that occupy diﬀerent clusters in the same term are independent [23]. The integrals
of all the products that occur when a speciﬁed l-sites are in one cluster are summed and
denoted , as in the N particle system [23], bl

where blm, bld denote the products over the mixed and doubly connected sites respectively.
By the term mixed we mean that the sites in the relevant cluster may be either only singly
connected or both singly and doubly connected. Note that the number of fij in each term of
the blm ranges from a minimum of l − 1 to a maximum of l(l − 1) − 1 and the corresponding
number in the bld part ranges from a minimum of 2(l − 1) to a maximum of l(l − 1). The
product l!S is a normalization factor and S is the total volume in s-space of all the N sites.
For example, b3 is

b3 = b3d + b3m =

ds1ds2ds3[(f31f13f21f12 + f32f23f31f13 + f32f23f21f12 +

+2f32f23f31f13f21 + 2f32f23f21f12f31)

Note that since each mixed connection between any two sites may be, as remarked, of three
kinds there are 50 terms in b3m whereas only 4 terms in b3d because the double connection
is unique.

We calculate, now, the number of terms contributed to the “conﬁguration integral” by
any speciﬁc bl. This contribution is valid only when the numbered sites in the same cluster
are linked to each other and is obtained by exploiting the special character of the bl from
Eq (31) in order to ﬁnd all the possible ways by which it contributes to the conﬁguration
integral. We take into account that the number of fij in each of its term ranges, as noted,
from (l − 1) to l(l − 1) and since each fij also denotes, as remarked, a link to site j in site i
the contribution of each bl may be obtained by calculating the number of possible ways by
which each of the quantities (l − 1), l, . . . l(l − 1), may be linked to l sites of the same kind as
the linked ones (note that we have only l diﬀerent sites) so as to construct an l-site cluster
provided that no site is linked to a one that is identical to it and no two or more identical
sites are linked to a third one. Thus, the number of diﬀerent ways to link (l − 1) sites to the
l sites is obtained by ﬁrst linking the (l − 1) sites to any (l − 1) sites that may be selected
in l diﬀerent ways from the given l sites. And since these (l − 1) sites are diﬀerent we have
to permute them in order to ﬁnd all the possible connections between them, but we have to
exclude all the permutations in which any one of the (l − 1) sites is linked to its identical
one. The allowed permutations are obtained from the inclusion-exclusion principle [26] and
are given by Pallowed = (l − 1)!(1 − 1
2! − 1
(l−1)! ), so that the number of

all the possible diﬀerent ways to construct an l-site cluster from (l − 1) diﬀerent ones is (we

When l is large the expression under the parentheses signs is very close to e−1 so that

(32)

(33)

Wl(l − 1) ≈ l!e−1

Now, since, as remarked, the number of fij related to an l-site cluster may range from (l − 1)
to l(l−1) we have, in order to ﬁnd all the possible diﬀerent contributions obtained from bl, to
calculate also the Wl(l), Wl(l + 1) . . . Wl(l(l −1)). Each of these is found by ﬁrst constructing
the minimally connected l-cluster from (l − 1) sites as in Eqs (32)-(33) which left one site
unconnected and all the others linked one time. Now, since each site in the l-cluster may
have links to all the other l − 1 sites, except to itself, the next step is to gradually link each
of the once-connected (l − 1) sites to all the others. Thus, the minimum number of sites
required to construct an l- cluster so that one of them has (l − 1) links to all the others
is (2l − 3) and the number of ways to do it is Wl(l − 1) + Wl(l) + . . . + Wl(2l − 3), where
Wl(l −1) is given by Eq (32) and each one of the other W ’s is given by the recursive equation
Wl(l + k) = Wl(l + k − 1)(l − (k + 2)) where 0 ≤ k ≤ (l − 2). In a similar manner we link each
of the other remaining (l − 2) once-connected sites so that, generally, for any k in the range
1 ≤ k ≤ (l −1) we have (l −3) values of nk in the range k(l −2) + 2 ≤ nk ≤ (k + 1)l −(2k + 1)
that satisfy the (l − 3) recursive equations

Wl(nk) = Wl(nk − 1)(l − m),

k(l − 2) + 2 ≤ nk ≤ (k + 1)l − (2k + 1)
2 ≤ m ≤ (l − 1)

(

(34)

We are left with the last site that has no link to any of the others so that following the same
reasoning that leads to Eq (34) one may write for it the following (l − 2) recursive equations
that express the number of ways to link it to the other (l − 1) sites

Wl(n) = Wl(n − 1)(l − m),

l(l − 2) + 2 ≤ n ≤ (l + 1)l − 2l
1 ≤ m ≤ (l − 1)

(

Now, we can sum Wl(l − 1) and all the other Wl(nk) in order to ﬁnd the number of ways by
which one may build an l-site cluster. That is, denoting this number as Dl we may write,
using the former equations

Dl = Wl(l − 1) + Wl(n1) + . . . + Wl(nk) + . . . + Wl(nl) = Wl(l − 1)[1 + (l − 2) +
+(l − 2)(l − 3) + . . . + (l − 2)! + (l − 2)!(l − 2) + . . . + ((l − 2)!)2 + ((l − 2)!)2(l − 2) +
+ . . . + ((l − 2)!)3 + . . . ((l − 2)!)k + . . . ((l − 2)!)l] = Wl(l − 1)[1 + ((l − 2) +
+(l − 2)(l − 3) + . . . + (l − 2)!) · (1 + (l − 2)! + ((l − 2)!)2 + . . . + ((l − 2)!)l−1]

(35)

The last result is the number of terms of bl and it is very large for large l. Thus, the total
contribution to the “conﬁguration integral” from each speciﬁc l-cluster is [23]

Q(V (q(s)))specif ic l−cluster =

(l!Sbl)ml,

Yl

14

where ml is, as noted, the number of times an l-cluster appears in a term. Now, we add all
the similar contributions from the other l-site clusters and this is obtained by mutiplying
N !
the expression from the last equation by
l ml!l! which is the number of ways to distribute
N diﬀerent sites into clusters so that m1 clusters have one object each, m2 clusters have two
l ml!l! is because the order inside each cluster and among
object each etc. The division by
them is irrelevant, whereas the exchange among the sites of clusters with the same number
of sites l is relevant. Thus, the overall contribution from all the l site clusters is

where we have used the relation s = S
N which is the volume in s space per site. Now, as may
be realized from the last equations, there are many terms in bl that represent clusters that
are composed of two parts that are connected by only one site, so that removing it splits the
relevant integral into a product of two. Thus, the cluster integrals bl’s may be simpliﬁed as
in the N particle system (see [20,23]) by representing them as sums of integrals that can not
be further reduced into a product of integrals. That is, these irreducible integrals, denoted
as βk, correspond to clusters all the members of which are more than singly connected as
follows

βk =

(38)

where, the product is over all sites that are connected to at least two other. From Eqs (29),
(31) and (38) we see that the terms of blm and βkm may be positive or negative depending
upon the evenness or oddness respectively in the numbers of fij. The terms of bld and βkd,
on the other hand, are always positive since the number of their fij is always even.

The ﬁrst two βk, for example, are

The coeﬃcients of 2, 6, and 12 signify the number of similar products that diﬀer only by
the direction of the connecting lines between the sites. Thus, taking into account that
the number of ways to distribute l diﬀerent objects into nk clusters of k objects each with
knk = l − 1 (with one object left over due to the nature of βk (see the discussion before

Note the similarity between the last equation and Eq (37). Using the Stirling approximation
[36] for ln l!, ln ml!, ln k! and ln nk! one may write the logarithms of the general terms of the
sums of Eqs (37) and (40), denoted by ln Tb and ln Tβ respectively, as

lnTb =

(ml ln(sNbl) + (ml − 1)(l ln l − l) − ml ln ml + ml)

(41)

lnTβ =

(nk ln(βk) + (nk − 1)(k ln k − k) + nk ln l − nk ln nk + nk) − ln 3 − 2 ln l

Now, if all the βk’s are positive one may replace [23] , for large values of l, the logarithm of
the sums in Eqs (37) and (40) by that of their largest terms which may be obtained from Eqs
(41) by ﬁrst subtracting from each a constant (denoted − ln Z for the ﬁrst of (41) and − ln ρ
knk = l − 1. We
for the second) multiplied by their respective conditions
then diferentiate ln Tb with respect to ml and ln Tβ with respect to nk and equate to zero so

that the values of ml and nk that maximize ln Tb and ln Tβ respectively are

Note that, due to the nature of bl and βk (see Eqs (31) and (38)), both Z and ρ has
dimension of inverse s. Substituting for nk in the second of Eqs (41) and regarding the
resulting expression, in the limit of very large l, as representing the logarithm of the sum
in (40) one obtain, neglecting the terms − ln 3 and −2 ln l compared to l and using the

Xl=1

Using the last equation we show that when the number of sites N of the ensemble is large
and when some large l-cluster in it have sites that are doubly connected to each other, in
which case both bl and βk are, as remarked, positive due to the even number of their fij then
enlarging this kind of connectivity even slightly, by adding the same links to them, results in
an enormous strengthening of the overall connectivity. Thus, dividing both sides of Eq (44)
by s we can write, for example, the contribution to its sum of the term that corresponds to
l = N. We ﬁrst write the logarithm of this term

ln TN = ln f (N, β) + N ln(Ne−1b0Z)

(45)

ln f (l,β)
l

We may represent the expression Nb0Ze−1 as eǫ so that if ǫ = 0 Nb0Ze−1 = 1, and when ǫ is
negative it is smaller than unity in which case the relevant term N ln(Ne−1b0Z) is negative
and since it is the dominant term in Eq (45) ln TN is also negative, which implies that TN
is smaller than unity and so its contribution to the sum in Eq (44) is small. Now, assuming
for N the value of N = 1015 and taking into account the previously obtained result of
= 0 we see that if ǫ increases from zero by only the small amount of 10−10,
liml→∞
due to adding a small quantity of linked sites to the cluster, the value of ln TN grows, as a
result of this, by 105 so that the contribution of TN to the sum increases by 10105. Thus, we
see that adding even a very small amount of connecting links to a large cluster of connected
sites results in an unproportional large amount of additional ”material” to this speciﬁc large
cluster and to a corresponding strengthening of the overall connectivity. Now, in order to
retain Eq (44) s must decreases in this case to a correspondingly very small value, where, as
noted, s is the ”volume” in s space per site which we may say is the amount of possibilities
allowed by the software in the forming stage of the site. Thus, the very small value of s in
this case is in accordance with what we have noted that adding even a small amount of links
to the larger terms of the sum in Eq (44) results in the outcome that from the large number
of possible sites allowed by the software there remains only a ﬁnite group of similar ones as
that shown on the screen, so that the volume s in s-space becomes very small. That is, the
number of possibilities has been considerably reduced.

Note that all the former discussion depends on the assumption that all the βk are positive
(see the paragraph after Eq (41)) but as has been remarked the signs of bl and βk alternate
due to the evennes and oddness of their number of fij (see the discussion after Eq (38)).
But if we conﬁne our discussion to only the double connected sites then all the bl and βk
are, as remarked, positive (in addition to their being mutually connected as required) so
the former discussion and Eqs (41)-(45) are obviously valid. That is, the double connected
clusters may show this kind of a large additional connectivity by only adding a very small
amount of connecting links. Note that the doubly connected N site system is exactly the
same as the N particle system discussed in [23] except that in the former case all the bld
and βkd are positive, and this kind of avalanche (or condensation as termed in [23]) has been
shown in [23] for the N particle system provided one assumes that all the β are positive.

We note that the process just described of a large increase in the fraction of the “material”
in connected large size clusters is frequently encountered in ensembles of shared computers

17

connected to each other and to the Internet. In this case an additional web site in the form
of a ﬁle that has been programmed intentionally for the purpose of adding and connecting
it to the other ﬁles of the shared ensemble enhances the connectivity of these members to
a very high degree. For example, suppose that all these members use some utility program
and that not all of them have the same version of it but use several ones, so that adding
an updation ﬁle of this program to them turns all the diﬀerent versions into one that is
common to all thereby increasing very much the total connectivity of them. As another
example we may assume that this added ﬁle is some virus that is supposed to act once the
members of the ensemble do some common act as, for example, opening their e-mail system.
In such an event this virus becomes eﬀective and may infect tens of thousands of computers
in a short time. Note, as remarked, that because of the unique character of the sites of the
Internet, when one intentionally attack the web it is done not by removing its sites and their
connecting links, as conventionally done when dismantling any other fractal, but by addind
a speciﬁc (ﬁle) site, a virus, that may damage the software content of the computers or even
their hardware.

We must note that the discussion in this section which is based on the partition function
from Eq (26) is not diﬀerent from that of Sections 2-3 based on the path integral method
since, as we now show, these two approaches coincide with each other in the limit of a large
ensemble of connected sites. We ﬁrst note that this coincidence has already been proved
generally in [27] for the case of periodic paths with period β [28] that start and end at the
same state and since β = 1
kT where k is the large Boltzman constant the period β is rather
small for moderate T . That is, the path integral for these small closed trajectories is no
other than the partition function, but considering the nature of the path integral formalism
used in Section 2-3 where we have constrained the action in each inﬁnitesimal s interval in
each integral to have exactly the same form we realize that all these paths are initiated and
terminated at the same states (sites) and the period is small as required. Moreover, the
equating process of all the diﬀerent s’s to each other causes all the diﬀerent possible states
(sites) to vanish except the one determined by the speciﬁc action inserted into each integral.
We can, therefore, write for the partition function [27].

where C is a normalization constant. Note the similarity between the last expression and
those of the path integrals from Eqs (8)-(9).

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

We have shown in Sections 2-3 that the stationary state in which one speciﬁc web site,
from a large number of possible ones allowed at the forming stage of writing the software
source, is shown on the screen when all the values of the extra variable s, related to this
forming stage of the site, are equated to each other. This equating process is necessary as
can be seen from Eq (9) for the general case, and Eq (21) for the harmonic oscilltor which
are valid only after this process is performed in which case the computer screen shows the
relevant stationary (state) site connected to its speciﬁc action S[q]. Otherwise, there is
no speciﬁc action S[q] and no web site to view on the screen. This is seen clearly for the

18

harmonic oscillator case in Eq (10) where each value of s gives rise to diﬀerent ηi(s) and,
therefore, to diﬀerent Ki and Si (see Eq (2)) so that a speciﬁc harmonic oscillator site is
obtained only when all these s’s are equated to each other in which case one remains with
only the unique ηi that gives rise to the related harmonic oscillator Ki from Eq (11). Note
that this equating procedure eliminates, as remarked, the extra variable s thereby causing
the system to pass from the forming stage of writing the program (that build the sites) which
depends on s to the ﬁnal equilibrium stage of running the speciﬁc written program where
only its relevant site is shown on the screen so that its form depends no more upon s but
only on the time-spatial variables of the screen. The equating of all the diﬀerent s values
for all the ensemble members of computers constitutes a repetition of the same process for
them. That is, if we imagine each as activated by its speciﬁc user, through clicking on the
keyboard, then equating the s values for all of them is as if each one writes a very similar
program (the only diﬀerences may be in the spatial variable, perhaps also in the time for
video ﬁles (sites)) which constitutes a repetition of the act of writing it so that when run on
their screen the probability to see the same group of sites is obviously large.

We note that obtaining equilibrium conﬁguration of any process through a large num-
ber of repetitions along a ﬁnite extent of time is the main characterstic of any numerical
simulation. That is, when simulating any system which evolutes through some process that
ends in an equilibrium conﬁguration as in the physical or chemical sciences one obtains this
stationary state only after a large number of iterations of the basic relation which governs
the remarked process. Better statistics is obtained when the number of iterations grows
since this increases also the number of samples. The advantage of these repetitions is clearly
seen when simulating the long range correlation functions for which the conventional Monte
Carlo simulation methods to numerically simulate and obtain them, using path integrals,
fails [29]. It has been shown explicitly by Parisi [30] and Namiki et al [29], using SQ methods,
that the following two point connected correlation function

< q1ql >=

d
dh

(

d[q]qle−Sh
d[q]e−Sh

1
h

R

R

)|h=0 =

(< ql >h − < ql >) + o(h),

(47)

where the action Sh = S −hq1 involves a small external additional term −hq1, may be solved
by replacing the ensemble averages with and without the small external source < ql >h and
< ql > respectively by the time averages calculated from the following Langevin equations

(48)

(49)

The η and ˜ηl are independent and assumed to satisfy

< η >=< ˜ηl >= 0, < ηl(t)ηm(s) >=< ˜ηl(t)˜ηm(s) >= 2δlmδ(t − s)

Solving the right hand side of Eq (47) generally results in a large statistical error [30,29],
so Parisi [30] uses the same random forces in Eqs (48), (49), that is, η = ˜η which reduces
considerably the statistical error as shown in [29] (see the appendix there). Thus, in order

˙ql = −

+ ηl

˙ql = −

+ ˜ηl

∂S
∂ql

∂Sh
∂ql

19

to be able to simulate and obtain the long range correlation functions one must equate not
only all the diﬀerent values s’s of η and those of ˜η but also to equate η to ˜η so that in
the stationary limit one obtains, as remarked, the sought-for simulations. But as noted by
Namiki et al [29] the last method, although works well for the ﬁxed potential and the o(4)
model, breaks down when using it to obtain the long range correlation function for the o(3)
model possibly due to its large degree of nonlinearity. This situation is avoided in [29] by
initiating a new round of repetitions where each one begins from the ﬁnal conﬁguration of
the former. That is, in order to improve the statistical results one have ﬁrst, as remarked,
to increase the number of samples which is obtained by parallel updating of Eqs (48), (49)
without and with the external source respectively using the same random forces for η and
˜η. These steps which are suﬃcient, as remarked, for the ﬁxed potential and the o(4) models
end in a breakdown of the simulation process for the o(3) model when the updating process
continues. Thus, one must [29] stop this updating before break-down occurs and restart
the whole procedure from switching again the external source and updating Eqs (48), (49)
starting from the last stopped conﬁguration as the initial one of the new round of updating.
In other words, by only repeating the switching and the updating process one obtains,
numerically, the sought-for long range correlation functions for the o(3) model.

Moreover, it has been shown [31–35] that these repetitions not only lead to numeri-
cal stabilization but when they are really performed (not just through clicking upon the
computer keyboard) lead to a real stabilization. This phenomenon, termed the quantum
Zeno eﬀect, has been validated both theoretically [31,33–35] and experimentally [32] and
its main characteristic is the preserving, through a large number of repetitions of the same
measurement, an initial state of the sytem [31,33] or guiding it through a prescribed path of
evolution, from a large number of possible ones [34,35]. This guiding through a prescribed
path of sites has been shown in Section 3 for the Harmonic oscillator example (see Eqs
(21)-(22) and the discussion there) where repeating the same or very similar versions of
programming and simulating the Harmonic oscillator interaction enhances and strengthens
the presence and existence of its relevant sites among the members of the large ensemble
of users (see Eqs (21)-(22)). Moreover, when these repetitions, during a ﬁnite total time,
becomes large so that the duration of each is small one is able to realize any predetermined
path of sites, from a large possible ones, which means, as remarked, that each member of
the ensemble has exactly the same ﬁles (sites) related to the Harmonic oscillator and the
correlation among them is, therefore, maximal. This maximum correlation has been found
also from the partition function method of Section 4 when all the sites of the ensemble are
doubly connected to each other so that each one of them has exactly the same sites and
so all the N members may be thought of as N identical replicas of the same N-linked site.
In the last situation it was found that adding, even a small amount of connecting links,
to any large doubly connected cluster results in a very large strengthening of the overall
connectivity of the ensemble so that the contribution of this cluster is large.

In summary, we have discussed the mechanism of the computer simulation which is used
so extensively by the exact sciences community. We show that this process may be described
by the generalized Langevin equation (the SQ theory) the extra variable of which may take
account of the inﬁnite possibilities of the programming process. We show, using both the
path integral and the partition function methods, that, considering a large ensemble of
shared computers connected to the Internet, one may enhance to a very high degree its

20

overall connectivity by adding to it only a slight amount of connecting links.

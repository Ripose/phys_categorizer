This contribution to the proceedings of the Cracow meeting on ‘Applications of Random Matrix
Theory’ summarizes a series of studies, some old and others more recent on ﬁnancial applications
of Random Matrix Theory (RMT). We ﬁrst review some early results in that ﬁeld, with particu-
lar emphasis on the applications of correlation cleaning to portfolio optimisation, and discuss the
extension of the Marˇcenko-Pastur (MP) distribution to a non trivial ‘true’ underlying correlation
matrix. We then present new results concerning diﬀerent problems that arise in a ﬁnancial con-
text: (a) the generalisation of the MP result to the case of an empirical correlation matrix (ECM)
constructed using exponential moving averages, for which we give a new elegant derivation (b) the
speciﬁc dynamics of the ‘market’ eigenvalue and its associated eigenvector, which deﬁnes an interest-
ing Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on the unit sphere and (c) the problem of the dependence of ECM’s
on the observation frequency of the returns and its interpretation in terms of lagged cross-inﬂuences.

I. PORTFOLIO THEORY: BASIC RESULTS

Suppose one builds a portfolio of N assets with weight wi on the ith asset. The (daily) variance of the portfolio

return is given by:

R2 =

wiσiCij σjwj ,

where σ2

expected gain of the portfolio is G =

wigi.

is the (daily) variance of asset i and Cij is the correlation matrix. If one has predicted gains gi, then the

In order to measure and optimize the risk of this portfolio, one therefore has to come up with a reliable estimate of
the correlation matrix Cij . This is diﬃcult in general [1, 2] since one has to determine of the order of N 2/2 coeﬃcients
out of N time series of length T , and in general T is not much larger than N (for example, 4 years of data give 1000
daily returns, and the typical size of a portfolio is several hundred stocks.) We will denote, in the following, q = N/T ;
an accurate determination of the true correlation matrix will require q

kurtosis of the stock, known to be typically κ
mean return, small compared to daily ﬂuctuations. The empirical correlation matrix is obtained as:

Because the portfolio is not constructed using E, this estimate is unbiased and the relative mean square-error is small

Problems indeed arise when one wants to estimate the risk of an optimized portfolio, resulting from a Markowitz
optimization scheme, which gives the portfolio with maximum expected return for a given risk or equivalently, the

From now on, we drop σi (which can always be absorbed in gi and wi). In matrix notation, one has:

P

The question is to estimate the risk of this optimized portfolio, and in particular to understand the biases of diﬀerent
possible estimates. We deﬁne the following three quantities:

The “In-sample” risk, corresponding to the risk of the optimal portfolio over the period used to construct it:

•

The “true” minimal risk, which is the risk of the optimized portfolio in the ideal world where C would be
perfectly known:

•

(gT E−1g)2

The “Out-of-sample” risk which is the risk of the portfolio constructed using E, but observed on the next period
of time:

•

From the remark above, the result is expected to be the same (on average) computed with C or with E′, the ECM
corresponding to the second time period. Since E is a noisy estimator of C such that
= C, one can use a convexity
argument for the inverse of positive deﬁnite matrices to show that in general:

E

Hence for large matrices, for which the result is self-averaging:

By optimality, one clearly has that:

out.

These results show that the out-of-sample risk of an optimized portfolio is larger (and in practice, much larger, see
Fig 1) than the in-sample risk, which itself is an underestimate of the true minimal risk. This is a general situation:
using past returns to optimize a strategy always leads to over-optimistic results because the optimization adapts to
the particular realization of the noise, and is unstable in time. In the case where the true correlation matrix is C = 1,
one can show that [3]:

underestimation can be reduced by matrix cleaning. From [4].

II. MATRIX CLEANING AND RMT

How should one ‘clean’ the empirical correlation matrix to avoid, as much as possible, such biases in the estimation
of future risk? In order to get some general intuition on this problem, let us rewrite the Markowitz solution in terms
of the eigenvalues λk and eigenvectors V k

i of the correlation matrix:

wi ∝

λ−1
k V k

i V k

j gj ≡

gi +

(λ−1

k −

1)V k

i V k

j gj

Xkj

Xkj

The ﬁrst term corresponds to the naive solution: one should invest proportionally to the expected gain (in units where
σi = 1). The correction term means that the weights of eigenvectors with λ > 1 are suppressed, whereas the weights
of eigenvectors with λ < 1 are enhanced. Potentially, the optimal Markowitz solution allocates a very large weight to
small eigenvalues, which may be entirely dominated by measurement noise and hence unstable. A very naive way to
avoid this is to go for the naive solution wi ∝

gi, but with the k∗ largest eigenvectors projected out:

wi ∝

gi −

Xk≤k∗;j

V k
i V k

j gj,

so that the portfolio is market neutral (the largest eigenvector correspond to a collective market mode, V 1
1/√N )
and sector neutral (other large eigenvectors contain sector moves). Since most of the volatility is contained in the
market and sector modes, the above portfolio is already quite good in terms of risk. More elaborated ways aim at
retaining all eigenvalues and eigenvectors, but after having somehow cleaned them. A well known cleaning corresponds
to the so-called “shrinkage estimator”: the empirical matrix is shifted ‘closer’ to the identity matrix. This is a Bayesian
method that assumes that the prior empirical matrix is the identity, again only justiﬁed if the market mode has been
subtracted out. More explicitely:

i ≈

Ec = αE + (1

−

where the subscript c corresponds to the cleaned objects. This method involves the parameter α which is undetermined,
but somehow related to the expected signal to noise ratio. If the signal is large, α
0 if the noise is large.
Another possible interpretation is through a constraint on the eﬀective number of assets in the portfolio, deﬁned as
i )−1 [2]. Constraining this number to be large (ie imposing a minimal level of diversiﬁcation) is equivalent to

choosing α small.

determine the theoretical edge of the ‘random’ part of the eigenvalue distribution, and to ﬁx k∗ such that λk
to this edge.

What is then the spectrum of a random correlation matrix? The answer is known in several cases, due to the work
of Marˇcenko and Pastur [5] and others [6, 7, 8]. We brieﬂy recall the results and some elegant methods to derive them,
with special emphasis on the problem of the largest eigenvalue, which we expand on below. Consider an empirical
correlation matrix E of N assets using T data points, both very large, with q = N/T ﬁnite. Suppose that the true
correlations are given by
= Cijδtt′ . This deﬁnes the Wishart ensemble [9]. In order to ﬁnd the eigenvalue
density, one introduces the resolvent:

The simplest case is when C = I. Then, E is a sum of rotationally invariant matrices δEt
in that case is to consider the so-called Blue function, inverse of G, i.e.
R(x) = B(x)
equal to q and N

ij = (xi
t )/T . The trick
such that B(G(z)) = z. The quantity
1/x is the ‘R-transform’ of G, and is known to be additive [5, 11, 12]. Since δEt has one eigenvalue

The case of a general C cannot be directly written as a sum of “Blue” functions, but one can get a solution using

the Replica trick or by summing planar diagrams, which gives the following relation between resolvents: [6, 7, 8]

where

Z =

from which one can easily obtain ρ(λ) numerically for any choice of C [8]. [In fact, this result can even be obtained
from the original Marˇcenko-Pastur paper by permuting the role of the appropriate matrices]. The above result does
however not apply when C has isolated eigenvalues, and only describes continuous parts of the spectrum. For example,
if one considers a matrix C with one large eigenvalue that is separated from the ‘Marˇcenko-Pastur sea’, the statistics
T −1/2, much
of this isolated eigenvalue has recently been shown to be Gaussian [13] (see also below), with a width
q1/2). A naive application of Eq. (24), on the other hand,
smaller than the uncertainty on the bulk eigenvalues (
would give birth to a ‘mini-MP’ distribution around the top eigenvalue. This would be the exact result only if the
top eigenvalue of C had a degeneracy proportional to N .

∼

∼

From the point of view of matrix cleaning, however, these results show that: (i) the expected edge of the bulk,
that determines k∗, obviously depends on the prior one has for C. The simplest case where C = I was investigated
in particular in [1, 10], with the results shown in Fig 2. Other choices are however possible and could lead to an
improved cleaning algorithm; (ii) the uncertainty on large eigenvalues is much less than that on the bulk eigenvalues,
meaning that the bulk needs a lot of shrinkage, but the bigger eigenvalues less so – at variance with the naive shrinkage
procedure explained above. An alternative route may consist in using the ‘power mapping’ method proposed by Guhr
[14] or clustering methods [15].

of one very large eigenvalue, corresponding to the market mode (see section IV) and (ii) the MP ﬁt reveals systematic deviations,
suggesting a non trivial structure of the true correlation matrix, even after sector modes have been accounted for (see [8, 16]).

III. EWMA EMPIRICAL CORRELATION MATRICES

Consider now the case where C = I but where the Empirical matrix is computed using an exponentially weighted

moving average (EWMA). More precisely:

random matrix with q ≡ N/T = 1/3.45, chosen to have the same upper edge. From [17].

In the case at hand, by evaluating B(x) when B′(x) = 0 we can write directly an equation whose solutions are the
spectrum edges (λ±)

λ± = log(λ±) + q + 1

(32)

When q is zero, the spectrum is a δ in 1 as expected. But as the noise increases (or the characteristic time decreases)
the lower edge approach zero very quickly as λ−
q). Although there are no exact zero eigenvalues for EWMA
matrices, the smallest eigenvalue is very close to zero.

IV. DYNAMICS OF THE TOP EIGENVALUE AND EIGENVECTOR

As mentioned above, it is well known that ﬁnancial covariance matrices are such that the largest eigenvalue is well
separated from the ‘bulk’, where all other eigenvalues reside. The ﬁnancial interpretation of this large eigenvalue is
the so-called ‘market mode’: in a ﬁrst approximation, all stocks move together, up or down. One can state this more
precisely in the context of the one factor model, where the ith stock return at time t is written as:

where the market mode φt is common to all stocks through their market exposure βi and the εi
noises, uncorrelated from stock to stock. Within such a model, the covariance matrix reads:

t are idiosyncratic

t = βiφt + εi
ri
t,

Cij = βiβjσ2

φ + σ2

i δij.

φ + σ2
When all σi’s are equal, this matrix is easily diagonalized; for N stocks, its largest eigenvalue is Λ0 = (
1 eigenvalues Λα are equal to σ2. The largest eigenvalue corresponds to the
and is of order N , and all the other N
eigenvector βi. More generally, the largest eigenvalue Λ0, normalized by the average square volatility of the stocks,
can be seen as a proxy for the average interstock correlation.

j )σ2

j β2

P

−

A natural question, of great importance for portfolio management, or dispersion trading (option strategies based
on the implied average correlation between stocks), is whether Λ0 and the β’s are stable in time. Of course, the
largest eigenvalue and eigenvector of the empirical correlation matrix will be, as discussed at length above, aﬀected
by measurement noise. Can one make predictions about the ﬂuctuations of both the largest eigenvalue and the
corresponding eigenvector induced by measurement noise? This would help separating a true evolution in time of the
average stock correlation and of the market exposure of each stock from one simply related to measurement noise.
We shall see that such a decomposition seems indeed possible in the limit where Λ0 ≫
average of the returns. This means that the matrix E evolves in time as:

We will assume, as in the previous section, that the covariance matrix is measured through an exponential moving

The true covariance matrix Cij =
is assumed to be time independent – this will give us our benchmark
hypothesis – with its largest eigenvalue Λ0 associated to the normalized eigenvector Ψ0. In this section we deal with
covariance matrices instead of correlation matrices for simplicity, but most results should carry over to this latter case
as well.

(Λ1/Λ0)2 smaller than the terms retained in Eq. (38).

We now need to work out an equation for the projection of the instantaneous eigenvector ψ0t on the true eigenvector

Ψ0. This can again be done using perturbation theory, which gives, in braket notation:

In the continuous time limit, we therefore have two coupled Langevin equations for the top eigenvalue λ0t and the

imately realized for ﬁnancial markets), the deviation from the true top eigenvalue δλ0 and the deviation angle θ are
independent Gaussian variables (the correlation between them indeed becomes zero as can be seen using Eq. (44) in
that limit, both following Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes.

From these results one directly obtains the variogram of the top eigenvalue as:

This is the result expected in the absence of a ‘true’ dynamical evolution of the structure of the matrix. From Fig.
4, one sees that there is clearly an additional contribution, hinting at a real evolution of the strength of the average
correlation with time. One can also work out the average overlap of the top eigenvector with itself as a function of
, one sees that an equation for the evolution of

the transverse component
is a priori also needed. It is easy to show, following the same method as above, that
the evolution of the angle φt made by the component with a ﬁxed direction is a free diﬀusion with a noise term of
order ǫΛ1/Λ0. Therefore, on the time scale ǫ−1 over which θt evolves,
can be considered to be quasi-constant,

Any signiﬁcant deviation from the above law would, again, indicate a true evolution of the market structure. Again,
Fig. 4, provides some evidence of such an evolution, although weaker than that of the top eigenvalue λ0.

V. FREQUENCY DEPENDENT CORRELATION MATRICES

The very deﬁnition of the correlation matrix a priori depends on the time scale over which returns are measured.
ln pi(t), where pi(t) is the price at time t. The

The return on time τ for stock i is deﬁned as: ri,τ (t) = ln pi(t + τ )
correlation matrix is then deﬁned as:

−

Cij (τ ) = h

ri,τ (t)rj,τ (t)
σiσj

ic

A relatively well known eﬀect is that the average inter-stock correlation grows with the observation time scale – this
is the so-called Epps eﬀect [18, 19]. For example, for a collection of stocks from the FTSE index, one ﬁnds, in the
period 1994-2003:

Ci6=j (5′)
h

i ≈

0.06;

Ci6=j (1h)
h

i ≈

0.19;

Ci6=j (1d)
h

i ≈

0.29

Besides the change of the average correlation level, there is also a change of structure of the correlation matrix: the
full eigenvalue distribution distribution changes with τ . A trivial eﬀect is that by increasing the observation frequency
one also increases the number of observations; the parameter q deﬁned above decreases and the noise band is expected
to shrink. This, at ﬁrst sight, appears to be a nice way to get rid of the observation noise in the correlation matrix
(see [20] for a related discussion). Unfortunately, the problem (or the interesting eﬀect, depending on the standpoint)
is that this is accompanied by a true modiﬁcation of the correlations, for which we will provide a model below. In
particular one observes the emergence of a larger number of eigenvalues leaking out from the bulk of the eigenvalue
spectrum (and corresponding to ‘sectors’) as the time scale τ increases. This eﬀect was also noted by Mantegna [21]:
the structure of the minimal spanning tree constructed from the correlation matrix evolves from a ‘star like’ structure
for small τ ’s (several minutes), meaning that only the market mode is present, to a fully diversiﬁed tree at the scale
of a day. Pictorially, the market appears as an embryo which progressively forms and diﬀerentiates with time.

The aim of this section is to introduce a simple model of lagged cross-inﬂuences that allows one to rationalize the
mechanism leading to such an evolution of the correlation matrix. Suppose that the return of stock i at time t is
inﬂuenced in a causal way by return of stock j at all previous times t′ < t. The most general linear model for this
reads:

ri,1(t) = ξi(t) +

dt′Kij(t

t′)rj,1(t′)

Here τ = 1 is the shortest time scale – say a few seconds. The kernel Kij is in general non-symmetric and describes
how the return of stock j aﬀects, on average, that of stock i a certain time later. We will deﬁne the lagged correlation
Cij(t

t′) by:

−

were already studied in [22]. Going to Fourier space, one ﬁnds the Fourier transform of the covariance matrix

where K(ω) is the Fourier transform of K(τ ) with by convention K(τ < 0) = 0. When cross-correlations are small,
which is justiﬁed provided the ri,1(t) corresponds to residual returns, where the market has been subtracted, the
relation between

Cij and Kij becomes quite simple and reads, for τ > 0:

Cij (τ ) = DjKij(τ ).

FIG. 6: Typical cross-inﬂuence kernels Kij (E) for three pairs of stocks, and ﬁt with the Laplace transforms of the sum of two
exponentials. Note that the inﬂuence amplitudes have diﬀerent signs, even for the same pair of stock, depending on the time
scale.

This equation allows one, in principle, to determine Kij(τ ) from the empirical observation of the lagged correlation
matrix. Suppose for simplicity that the inﬂuence kernel takes the form Kij(τ ) = K 0
ij/(iω +
Γij). In this model, the primary object is the inﬂuence matrix K which has a much richer structure than the correlation
matrix: each element deﬁnes an inﬂuence strength K 0 and an synchronisation time Γ−1. In fact, as shown in Figs.
5 and 6, ﬁtting the empirical data requires that Kij is parameterized by a sum of at least two exponentials, one
corresponding to a time scale of minutes, and a second one of hours; sometimes the inﬂuence strength corresponding
to these two time scales have opposite signs. Pooling together the parameters corresponding to diﬀerent pairs of
stocks, we ﬁnd, as might have been expected, that strongly coupled stocks (large K 0) have short synchronisation
times Γ−1.

ije−Γij τ , then Kij(ω) = K 0

Coming back to the observation that the correlation matrix is frequency dependent, one should note that the scale

dependent correlation matrix Cij (τ ) is related to

Cij(ω) by:

Cij (τ ) =

ri,τ rj,τ ic =
h

dω S2(ωτ )

Cij (ω)

Z

(56)

where S(.) is the form factor (i.e. Fourier transform of the window used to deﬁne returns on scale τ , for example a
ﬂat window in the simplest case). Therefore, for τ small one ﬁnds that residuals are uncorrelated (i.e. the correlation
matrix has no structure beyond the market mode):

whereas on long time scales the full correlation develops as:

Cij (τ

0)

→

≈

Diδij,

Cij (τ

)
→ ∞

≈

Diδij +

dτ [DjKij(τ ) + DiKji(τ )] .

Z

The emergence of correlation structure therefore reveals the lagged cross-inﬂuences in the market. Note that on long
time scales, small K 0’s can be counterbalanced by large synchronisation times Γ−1, and lead to signiﬁcant correlations
between ‘weakly coupled’ stocks.

We believe that a more systematic empirical study of the inﬂuence matrix Kij and the way it should be cleaned,

in the spirit of the discussion in section II, is worth investigating in details.

We want to thank Pedro Fonseca and Boris Schlittgen for many discussions on the issues addressed in sections IV and V,
and Szilard Pafka and Imre Kondor for sharing the results on the EWMA matrices given in section III. We also thank G´erard
Ben Arous and Jack Silverstein for several clarifying discussions. We also thank the organisers of the meeting in Cracow for
inviting us and for making the conference a success.

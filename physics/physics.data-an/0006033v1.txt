Abstract: On contrary to the customary thought, the well-known “lemma”
that the distribution function of a collisionless Boltzmann gas keeps invari-
ant along a molecule’s path represents not the strength but the weakness of
the standard theory. One of its consequences states that the velocity dis-
tribution at any point is a condensed “image” of all, complex and even dis-
continuous, structures of the entire spatial space. Admitting the inability to
describe the entire space with a microscopic quantity, this paper introduces
a new type of distribution function, called the solid-angle-average distribu-
tion function. With help of the new distribution function, the dynamical
behavior of collisionless Boltzmann gas is formulated in terms of a set of
integrals deﬁned by molecular paths. In the new formalism, not only that
the diﬃculties associated with the standard theory are surmounted but also
that some of practical gases become calculable in terms of today’s computer.

Introduction

The Boltzmann gas, by which we mean a gas in that molecules are subject
to binary short-range interparticle forces, is usually studied by means of
the Boltzmann equation[1][2]. The conventional wisdom assumes that if a
suﬃciently large supercomputer were available, a ﬁnite-diﬀerence scheme
could be employed to construct solutions of the Boltzmann equation and
many realistic gases would become completely analyzable.

Some of diﬃculties related to the solution-construction scheme of the
Boltzmann equation are relatively well-known[3]. They include the follow-
ing. (i) Seven variables have to be dealt with (time, spatial coordinates and
velocity components). (ii) The collisional operator in the Boltzmann equa-
tion is complex in nature. Due to these diﬃculties, only low-dimensional
problems, for instance those having one dimension of coordinates and one
dimension of velocity components, were tried in practical calculations.

In some of our works[4][5], it was argued that more fundamental diﬃ-
culties existed with the standard kinetic theory. One of them was that dis-
tribution functions of Boltzmann gases involved in discontinuity and quasi-
discontinuity, thus the eﬀectiveness of using a ﬁnite-diﬀerence scheme to
solve the Boltzmann equation, as well as the validity of the Boltzmann
equation itself, became questionable.

Putting aside whether the arguments presented by our previous works
are suﬃciently convincing or not, we will, in this paper, engage our primary
attention with the following subject. Is there any alternative approach with
the aid of that one can use today’s computational means to calculate at least
some of full-dimensional practical gases? A positive answer to this question
will apparently arouse widespread interest.

It turns out that if an average-type distribution function, called the solid-
angle-average distribution function, is introduced and the path-information
of molecules is adequately taken into account, then the objective mentioned
above can be accomplished.

The structure of this paper is the following.

In Sec. 2, the standard
approach to the Boltzmann gas is employed to “derive” a lemma that the
distribution function of a collisionless Boltzmann gas, if continuous at the
beginning, will keep its value along a molecule’s path.
In applying the
lemma to various situations, we are led to an unexpected conclusion that
strictly continuous and well-behaved distribution functions exist only on a
theoretical assumption. In Sec 3, we examine two kinds of discontinuous dis-
tribution functions. The ﬁrst kind is related to point-like molecular sources

2

and the second kind to surface-like molecular sources. It is shown that the
solid-angle-average distribution function needs to be introduced in order to
treat discontinuous distribution functions related to the molecular sources.
Sec. 4 oﬀers a comprehensive formulation in which both continuous and dis-
continuous distribution functions are formulated in terms of path-integrals
deﬁned by initial-state and boundary conditions. The ﬁnal section, Sec. 5,
gives a brief survey on essential features of the new formalism.

2 Evolution of continuous distribution function

We suppose in this section that the distribution function of interest is per-
fectly continuous, diﬀerentiable in a more exact language, in the position-
velocity space (µ-space).

Under this supposition, according to the standard kinetic theory, the

collisionless Boltzmann equation holds and it reads

∂f
∂t

+ v ·

∂f
∂r

+

F
m

·

∂f
∂v

= 0,

(1)

in which the collisional eﬀects between molecules have been disregarded (as
the title of this paper has suggested). If the initial state

f (t0 + 0, r, v) = f (t0, r, v)

and the boundary condition

f (t, r, v) = Z K(v, v1)f (t, r, v1)dv1,

(2)

(3)

where the shape of K represents the collisional eﬀects between molecules
and boundaries[6], are regarded as known ones, the solution of Eq. (1) can
be constructed by means of a ﬁnite-diﬀerence scheme[3]. In such a scheme,
notably, the governing equation (1) and the initial and boundary conditions
(2)-(3) constitute a complete equation set, and any additional information,
such as the path-information of individual molecules, becomes theoretically
dispensable. (In a sense, the whole idea behind introducing the conservation-
type partial diﬀerential equations into kinetic theory is just to avoid knowing
paths of individual molecules.)

Instead of making a detailed analysis of the standard formalism out-
lined above, which has been done elsewhere[4], we now use the formalism to
“derive” a relatively well-known lemma in statistical mechanics. The point

3

= 0.

(4)

df

dt(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)r(t),v(t)

here is that the lemma will automatically lead us to the very essence of gas
dynamics.

By relating the vector variables r and v in (1) to a molecule’s path, the
partial diﬀerential equation can be rewritten in the form of a simple ordinary
diﬀerential equation

Of course, r(t) and v(t) are associated with the equations of motion for a
single molecule

dr(t)

dt

= v,

dv(t)

dt

=

F
m

,

(5)

where F stands for all forces acting upon the molecule. Equation (4) simply
means

f (t, r, v)|r(t),v(t) = Constant.

(6)

That is to say, in the absence of collisions a continuous distribution function
keeps invariant along a molecular path in µ-space.
[Since formula (6) is
the integral of (4) along a path, we may regard the formula as a primitive
prototype of path-integral approach.] If the time development operator T is
employed to represent the equations of motion (5), namely if we have

T (t0, t)[r(t0), v(t0)] = [r(t), v(t)],

then we can equivalently express (6) as

f (t, r, v) = f (t0, r0, v0) = f (t0, T −1r, T −1v),

(7)

(8)

where r0 = r(t0), v0 = v(t0) and T −1 = T (t, t0). In view of (8) and (6), we
will refer to f (t0) as the “source” function and refer to f (t) as the “image”
function. In a similar spirit, it will be said that r0 is a source point and r
an image point.

Now, we use the path-invariance expressed by (6) to derive some dynam-
ical features of the Boltzmann gas. These features, though quite interesting
and very essential, received no enough attention before. For simplicity only
situations in that no external force exists will be considered, though equa-
tions (4)-(8) are valid more generally.

Suppose, to begin with, that the initial distribution function f (t0, r, v)
is known (which is continuous) and we are concerned with the velocity dis-
tribution at a speciﬁc point r, denoted by fr(t, v) hereafter. Equation (8)
shows that

fr(t, v) = f (t0, T −1r, v).

(9)

4

For one ﬁxed value of vi = |vi|, the source points ri = T −1r simply form
a spherical surface, labeled as Si = S(vi) in Fig. 1. The radius of such a
surface can be expressed by

|ri − r| = vi · (t − t0).

(10)

To determine the velocity distribution, we must let vi take values from very
small to very large, and thus the radius |r−ri| varies from very small to very
large. This implies that the velocity distribution fr(t, v) is a condensed im-
age of the entire spatial space. If f (t0, r, v) is not spatially uniform, fr(t, v)
will possess a complex structure, inﬁnitely complex in general situations
(which reminds us of the famous Cantor set and many other interesting
structures in the fractal studies). To make the situation even more wor-
risome, the inference presented above also suggests that any discontinuous
things, if exist in the spatial space, will constantly create discontinuous im-
ages on velocity distributions in the nearby and distant regions (virtually
everywhere).

To see the point in another perspective, let’s assume that a numerical
work is being carried out and the velocity space is being divided into many
small but ﬁnite cells (for time being pay less attention to the spatial space),
of which one takes the form ∆v = v2∆v∆Ω. It is then up to the investigator
to determine the distribution function for each of the cells, denoted by

fr(t, ∆v, ∆Ω).

(11)

In other words, each of fr(t, ∆v, ∆Ω) should be endowed with one deﬁnite
value. The task, though seems quite straightforward, cannot be done con-
ventionally. Look at Fig. 2, in which the spatial cone −∆Ω corresponding
to the velocity cone ∆Ω, called the eﬀective cone hereafter, and the two
spherical surfaces Si = S(vi) and Si+1 = S(vi+1), where vi+1 − vi = ∆v,
are plotted. It is easy to ﬁnd that when v varies within the range v2∆v∆Ω,
the source point T −1r runs over the shaded volume in the ﬁgure. Since the
thickness of the shaded volume is proportional to ∆v solely (for the ﬁxed
t − t0), if we let ∆v be smaller and smaller the value of

lim
∆v→0

fr(t, ∆v, Ω)

(12)

tends to a limit in the usual sense. Whereas, the size of ∆Si, the area
element on S(vi) enclosed by the eﬀective cone, is proportional to v2
i , and if
we let ∆Ω be smaller and smaller the value of

lim
∆Ω→0

fr(t, v, ∆Ω)

(13)

5

tends to a limit at a rate that strongly depends on the magnitude of v.
That is to say, the velocity distribution at r is not uniformly continuous.
According to mathematics textbooks[7][8], a function that is not uniformly
continuous may involve some irregularities and has to be treated carefully.
As far as our situation is concerned, there indeed exist diﬃcult things. As
one thing, when vi is rather large, the area of ∆Si must be rather large.
If the source function f (t0) on this large area element varies signiﬁcantly
(quite possible in practical situations), giving a unique value to the image
function fr(t, ∆v, ∆Ω) becomes a tricky business. This type of diﬃculty has
been named as quasi-discontinuity in our previous works[4][5].

We now study boundary eﬀects. At ﬁrst suppose, if the path-invariance
expressed by (6) is combined with the boundary condition (3), the boundary
eﬀects can be regarded as being formulated completely. The investigation
below, however, tells a diﬀerent story. First of all, note that a realistic
boundary cannot be considered as having a geometrically and physically
uniform surface. This, according to the spirit of calculus, leaves us no choice
but to divide the boundary into many area elements, inﬁnitesimally small in
the theoretical sense. We are then supposed to examine how each of them
receive and emit incident molecules.
If we assume that an area element
dS in Fig. 3 uniformly reemit the incident molecules and the distribution
function immediately above it is known as f (ro, v), it follows from (6) that,
assuming the gas to be relatively stationary,

f (ro, v) = f (rp1, v) = f (rp2, v).

(14)

An interesting question must arise. What is the diﬀerence between the ve-
locity distributions at p1 and at p2? Fig. 3b oﬀers manifestation that the
velocity distribution at p1 takes the value of f (ro, v) within the solid-angle
range dΩ1 while the velocity distribution at p2 takes the same value within
dΩ2. An essential fact is that the inﬁnitesimally small dΩ1 is signiﬁcantly
larger than the inﬁnitesimally small dΩ2. It is then rather obvious that equa-
tion (14) alone cannot be deemed as a satisfactory description of the process.
(The next section shows that introducing δ-functions into the scheme does
not provide much help either.)

We have seen that the path-invariance lemma, though intended to de-
scribe the evolution of continuous distribution function, discloses many fea-
tures that cannot be well treated in terms of continuous distribution func-
tions.

Before ﬁnishing this section and turning our attention to the next sub-
ject, we wish to comment on the diﬀerences between the Boltzmann-equation

6

approach and the approach represented by formulas (4)-(8), though it seems
that formula (4) or (6) is “derived from” and “completely equivalent to” the
collisionless Boltzmann equation (1).

According to most textbooks, the derivation of the Boltzmann equation
is closely related to the conservation law in the phase space µ-space[1]. Ref.
4 and Ref. 5, however, argue that such a conservation law is not truly
sound. On one hand, deﬁning ﬂuxes through ﬁve-dimensional hypersurfaces
(six of them can enclose a six-dimensional volume element) is an absolute
must for the conservation law; on the other hand, such ﬂuxes cannot be
well deﬁned in either physical or mathematical sense. For instance, in deﬁn-
ing a ﬂux through the ordinary surface dydz we invoke that the velocity
˙x = vx is perpendicular to the surface; whereas in deﬁning a ﬂux through
the hypersurface dvxdvydvzdydz we cannot invoke that the velocity ˙x = vx
is perpendicular to the hypersurface, because vx itself is among the ﬁve
dimensions of the hypersurface.

Formula (4) can be derived independently through a Jacobian approach
under two assumptions[1][2]. One is that the distribution function is per-
fectly continuous at an initial time. The other is that forces acting on all
molecules are free from dissipation (independent of speed) and free from
ﬂuctuation (smooth everywhere). After obtaining (4), equation (1) can be
obtained by abandoning the path-information expressed by equation (5).
Noting that the abandonment involves an information loss, we wish to say
that the approach represented by (4)-(8), instead of the collisionless Boltz-
mann equation (1), should be regarded as a more basic and more complete
formalism. The discussion of this section, in which expressions (4)-(8), in-
stead of (1), reveal the essential features of continuous distribution function,
also substantiates the statement presented above.

The standard kinetic theory gets heritages from the ordinary ﬂuid me-
chanics. It assumes that a local value of distribution function is largely inﬂu-
enced by its immediate neighborhood and the inﬂuence is exerted through
two-dimensional surfaces or ﬁve-dimensional hypersurfaces. By adopting
this assumption, the theory unanimously employs a conservation-type par-
tial diﬀerential equation to set up its framework. Formulas (4)-(8), however,
suggest that events of gas dynamics develop along molecular paths, which
are one-dimensional lines in µ-space. The new picture, quite diﬀerent from
the standard one in the physical and mathematical senses, implies that even
a gas that initially possesses a perfectly continuous distribution function will
not behave itself like a continuous medium. We have manifestly seen this
point in the discussion related to the quasi-discontinuity.

7

Finally, formulas (4)-(8) oﬀer, in a primitive manner though, diﬀerent
concepts concerning the way we approach to gas dynamics. Instead of rely-
ing on comprehensive, but diﬃcult and delicate, diﬀerential equations, one
is virtually led to accepting a procedure-type approach. Such approach sup-
posedly includes the following steps: (i) to determine paths of individual
molecules; (ii) to formulate how a local distribution function gives a contri-
bution to another local distribution function through a path; (iii) to integrate
all contributions associated with all possible molecular paths. The last step
is necessary since, according to the basic principles of statistical mechanics,
molecular paths must involve a probabilistic nature due to the molecule-
boundary and molecule-molecule interaction. (All points in this paper are
given in terms of classical mechanics.) We will, by following Feynman[9],
call an approach of this type the path-integral approach.

3 Evolution of discontinuous distribution function

The last section has shown that the Boltzmann gas should be regarded
less as a perfectly continuous medium and more as a special collection of
individual molecules. In this section we will formulate how discontinuous
distribution functions, each of which describes a set of molecules, develop
along molecular paths.

For simplicity only discontinuous distribution functions that are pro-
duced by point-like sources and surface-like sources are of our interest. It
is also assumed that molecules of the interested gases are free from exter-
nal forces. If needed, the approach here can, in a straightforward way, be
adapted to more general situations.

In Fig. 4, a point r0 is plotted at which molecules are generated (for
whatever reasons). To make the discussion applicable later, the molecular
emission rate ρ is allowed to depend on the time, velocity magnitude and
velocity direction. The number of molecular emission can thus be expressed
by

ρ(t0, r0, v, Ω0)dt0dvdΩ0,

(15)

where Ω0 is deﬁned in the frame whose origin is at r0. Moving along a
molecule’s path, it is found that at a later time t the emitted molecules
spread over the volume

|r − r0|2vdtdΩ0

(16)

8

where r is the point in the spatial space such that

r − r0 = v(t − t0).

It follows from (15) and (16) that the density of molecules at r is

n(r) =

ρdvdt0dΩ0

|r − r0|2vdtdΩ0

=

ρdv

|r − r0|2v

,

(17)

(18)

where dt = dt0 has been understood. Since the distribution function f at
the point r satisﬁes

f v2dvdΩ = n(r) =

ρdv

|r − r0|2v

,

ZΩ

the distribution function produced by the point-like source is

f (t, r, v, Ω) =

ρ(t0, r0, v, Ω0)

|r − r0|2v3

δ(Ω − Ω0).

(19)

(20)

Note that Ω0 in (20) takes the same direction as that of (r−r0). The form of
(20) manifests that molecules produced by a point-like source are associated
with a discontinuous distribution function. If one tries to apply the Boltz-
mann equation (1) to it, diﬃculties arise sharply with the diﬀerentiation
operations.

Now, we consider a surface-like source of molecules. It seems that after
the surface is divided into many small area elements and the formula Eq.
(20) is applied to each of them, our task is virtually accomplished. However,
the following discussion shows that if we stick to what the standard kinetic
theory implies, more troublesome things will emerge and no progress can be
made.

Let ∆S0i denote one of area elements on the surface and η(t0, r0, v, Ω0)

denote the molecular emission rate per unit area on ∆S0i. By identifying

η(t0, r0, v, Ω0)∆S0i

(21)

with the molecular emission rate ρ in (20), we ﬁnd the entire distribution
function produced by the surface-like source to be

f (t, r, v, Ω) = Xi

η∆S0i

|r − r0i|2v3 δ(Ω − Ω0i),

(22)

9

where i runs over all the elements on the surface. If one rewrites (22) in the
integral form

(23)

f (t, r, v, Ω) = Z

ηdS0

|r − r0|2v3 δ(Ω − Ω0),

the following question will be of the immediate concern. Does equation (23)
deﬁne a normally behaved distribution function? Fig. 5 demonstrates that
each of Ω0 points to a diﬀerent direction while the distribution function on
the left side of (23) involves only one direction deﬁned by Ω. That is to say,
expression (23) cannot be integrated in the usual sense.

It is quite interesting to look at the peculiarities that we have just en-
countered. In dealing with our discontinuous distribution functions neither
the usual diﬀerentiation nor the usual integration works smoothly.

In order to ﬁnd a way out of the diﬃcult situation, we propose to use
the following solid-angle-average distribution function such that if the exact
distribution function f (t, r, v) is known, which exists only in a pure academic
sense, then the average distribution function is

¯f (t, r, v, ∆Ω) =

1

∆ΩZ∆Ω

f (t, r, v)dΩ,

(24)

where ∆Ω is a solid-angle range in the velocity space set by the investigator.
In practical calculations, it is convenient to employ the spherical coordi-
nate system of velocity, in which Ω is deﬁned by the polar angle θ and the
azimuthal angle φ, and the solid angle range can be expressed by

∆Ω ≈ sin θ∆θ∆φ.

(25)

On this understanding, the entire solid-angle range of velocity associated
with a spatial point r is divided into a large number of small, but ﬁnite,
ranges, which may or may not be equal to each other. Of course, if the
distribution function is smooth enough and ∆Ω is suﬃciently small, we may
simply assume

¯f (t, r, v, ∆Ω) = f (t, r, v, Ω).

(26)

In the rest of this paper, we will always omit the bar notation when referring
to such distribution function.

In terms of practical calculations, the size of ∆Ω should be chosen prop-
erly so that the computational work can be done eﬃciently and at the same
time no signiﬁcant macroscopic phenomena will be overlooked.

As we may notice, an investigator of numerical work can take a sim-
ilar strategy to treat distribution functions in terms of ∆r and ∆v. The

10

diﬀerence here lies in that our solid-angle-average distribution function is
introduced in a theoretical (analytical) consideration: the discontinuity rep-
resented by (20) and the quasi-discontinuity represented by (13) should, and
have to, be handled under the new deﬁnition.

It is rather important to emphasize that the distribution function intro-
duced above seems to be an “approximate” one, but it actually represents an
“accurate” approach in the following two senses. One is that by letting ∆Ω
be suﬃciently small, we can describe a statistical process with any desirable
accuracy. The other is that errors related to giving up the exact distribution
function are largely inherent to nature not to the way we approach to it.

With help of the new average distribution function, the deterministic
nature and the probabilistic nature of a statistical process can be kept in
a balanced way. By using all kinds of mathematical operations, such as
diﬀerentiation and integration, to formulate the distribution function, we
preserve the macroscopic causality. By taking the solid-angle average, some
of the microscopic information, in particular those related to discontinuity
and quasi-discontinuity, are forsaken forever.

We are now equipped to formulate the discontinuous distribution func-
tion due to the existence of a surface-like source, as shown in Fig. 6. For
a chosen solid-angle range ∆Ω in the velocity space there is an eﬀective
cone −∆Ω in the spatial space. A surface-like molecular source enclosed
by the eﬀective cone, the shaded area ∆S in Fig. 6, gives contributions to
f (t, r, v, ∆Ω).

Assuming the emission rate on the surface to be known and allowing
expression (23), not normally behaved though, to represent the emitted
molecules, we obtain from (24)

f =

1

∆ΩZ Z∆S

ηdS0

|r − r0|2v3 δ(Ω − Ω0)dΩ.

By exchanging the order of the integration, we ﬁnally arrive at

f (t, r, v, ∆Ω) =

1

∆Ω Z∆S

η(t0, r0, v, Ω0)dS0

|r − r0|2v3

.

(27)

(28)

In the integrand of (28) r0 is the position of dS0, t0 is equal to t − |r − r0|/v
and Ω0 points to the direction of (r − r0).

It is easy to see that the distribution function expressed by (28) is ﬁnite

and well behaved.

11

4 The complete path-integral formulation and its

application

The discussion in the last two sections has shown that the distribution func-
tion at any speciﬁc point consists of two parts. The ﬁrst part is a continuous
one produced by the continuous distribution function existing previously;
the second part is a discontinuous one produced by surface-like molecular
sources. Here, we summarize the last two sections and give a comprehensive
formulation for the dynamics of collisionless Boltzmann gas.

In Fig. 7 we assume that the complete solid-angle-average distribution
function f (t, r, v, ∆Ω) is aﬀected by a continuous distribution function and
a surface-like source. Both the “sources” exist within the eﬀective cone
and constantly “emit” molecules into the region around the point r. The
complete distribution function can formally be expressed as

f (t, r, v, ∆Ω) = f(i) + f(ii),

(29)

where f(i) and f(ii) are produced by the aforementioned two sources respec-
tively.

First, we wish to determine f(i) in terms of certain speciﬁcations of ini-
tial state. Providing the initial state of the continuous distribution function,
denoted by f ct, is given only at one speciﬁc moment t0, we have no other
choices but to take the following approach. All relevant source points, ac-
cording to Sec. 2, can be determined by the mapping T −1r and by the
eﬀective cone −∆Ω. Namely, they distribute on an area element of the
spherical surface |r0 − r| = v(t − t0), denoted by ∆S1 in Fig. 7. We will refer
to such area element as a virtual eﬀective surface in view of that similar
surface-like sources (boundaries) are physical ones. From (6) and (24), the
continuous part of the distribution function can be written as an integral

f(i)(t, r, v, ∆Ω) =

=

∆Ω Z∆Ω
|r − r0|2∆ΩZ∆S1

1

1

f ct(t, r, v, Ω)dΩ

f ct(t0, r0, v, Ω0)Ur0 rdS0

(30)

where r0 is the position of dS0, Ω0 is in the direction (r − r0), and Ur0 r is a
specially deﬁned path-clearness function such that

Ur0 r = ( 1 no block along the path from r0 to r

0 otherwise.

(31)

Note that the diﬃculty of quasi-discontinuity discussed in Sec. 2 is no longer
an issue: f(i) is uniquely deﬁned and makes appropriate physical sense no
matter how dynamically the source function f ct(t0) varies on the virtual
eﬀective surface ∆S1.

If the distribution function is known within a period of time (before t),
we have freedom to choose the virtual eﬀective surface. For instance, by
choosing the surface ∆S ′

1 in Fig. 7, we have, as an alternative of (30),

f(i) =

1

∆ΩZ∆S ′

1

f ct(t0, r0, v, Ω0)Ur0 r

|r − r0|2

| cos α|dS0,

(32)

where α is the angle between the direction (r−r0) and the normal of the area
element dS0, and the time t0 now depends on the position of dS0, namely
t0 = t − |r − r0|/v.

Then, we wish to formulate the discontinuous part of the distribution
function. As suggested in the last two sections, boundary surfaces in a gas
can be treated as surface-like molecular sources, since they constantly reemit
incident molecules. In Fig. 7, the boundary surface ∆S2 within the eﬀective
cone, called the physical eﬀective surface, is singled out as a surface-like
source that can aﬀect f (t, r, v, ∆Ω).

The focus is naturally on the local emission rate η(t0, r0, v, Ω0) deﬁned by
(21). To determine it, we ﬁrst consider the falling rate of incident molecules
expressed by

ξ(t0, r0, vi, Ωi) = f (t0, r0, vi, Ωi) cos θiU (cos θi),

(33)

where θi is the angle between the inward normal of the local surface and the
incident direction of the molecules and U is a step function whose value is
equal to unity if cos θi > 0 and equal to zero otherwise.

As well known, the functional relation between η and ξ has to be ulti-
mately measured in experiments[6], though some kinds of theoretical models
may be of use at some stages. To see how this relation can be formulated
empirically, consider a molecule that moves with the velocity (vi, Ωi), strikes
an area element and leaves the area element with a velocity within the range
dvdΩ0, with respect to the surface element, in a certain probability. If the
probability is denoted by

and its normalization takes the form

P (vi, Ωi, v, Ω0)dvdΩ0

Z P (vi, Ωi, v, Ω0)dvdΩ0 = 1,

13

(34)

(35)

then the emission rate of the area element, for rareﬁed gases, will satisfy

η(t0, r0, v, Ω0) = Z P (vi, Ωi, v, Ω0)ξv2

i dvidΩi.

(36)

To verify the correctness of (36), one may integrate (36) and obtain, with
the help of (35),

dt0dS0Z η(t0, r0, v, Ω0)dvdΩ0 = dt0dS0Z ξ(t0, r0, vi, Ωi)v2

i dvidΩi,

(37)

which is nothing but the conservation law of the molecular number on the
surface element. It is now clear that the purpose of such experiment should
be to determine the functional form of P (vi, Ωi, v, Ω0).

Under the assumption that the molecular emission rate η of the involved
boundary surface has been determined (by whatever means), the interested
discontinuous part can, by virtue of Eq. (28), be written as

f(ii) =

1

∆Ω Z∆S2

η(t0, r0, v, Ω0)dS0

|r − r0|2v3

Ur0 r,

where the path-clearness function Ur0 r has been deﬁned by (31).

The ﬁnal result is then

f (t, r, v, ∆Ω) =

1

∆Ω Z∆S ′

1

f ct(t0, r0, v, Ω0)| cos α|

|r − r0|2

Ur0 rdS0

+

1

∆Ω Z∆S2

η(t0, r0, v, Ω0)
|r − r0|2v3 Ur0 rdS0,

(38)

(39)

where the ﬁrst term of the right side can be replaced by (30). If macroscopic
quantities are of interest, the distribution function expressed by (39) can be
used as a conventional one.

At this point, it is interesting to comment on the time-irreversibility
of the formalism given above.
It is kind of well-known that the time-
reversibility dilemma related to a dynamical process can be eliminated if
a proper statistical average is taken. With the statistical average, two is-
sues get involved. (i) Some pieces of microscopic information are forsaken.
(ii) Conservative basic forces are converted into ﬂuctuating and dissipative
(speed-dependent) forces. Notably, the second issue mentioned above is di-
rectly responsible for the time-irreversibility of the interested process. In this
approach, it appears that the time-irreversibility has nicely been embedded.
Though the pure evolution of continuous distribution function expressed by

14

(6) or (8) is time-reversible, other treatments, including the deﬁnition of
the solid-angle-average distribution function and the formulation of bound-
ary eﬀects, are manifestly time-irreversible. In particular, by allowing the
molecule-boundary interaction to be determined by empirical laws (or other
adequate statistical laws), the formulation in this paper is fully in harmony
with the Langevin theory[10], in which ﬂuctuating and dissipative forces nat-
urally arise from the interaction between a moving body and its surrounding
molecules.

At the end of this section, we give a brief look at what will happen
if a calculation suggested by this paper is practically performed. Fig. 8
oﬀers schematic of a gas leaking out of a large container through a small
hole. (Ref. 4 shows that the standard theory encounters many diﬃculties in
treating the case.) Since the container is rather large one may assume that
the distribution function on a surface, labeled as S in the ﬁgure, constantly
takes the value

(40)

f = n0(cid:18) m

2πκT(cid:19)3/2

exp −

mv2

2κT ! ,

provided that the surface S is not very close to the hole. It is obvious that
the values of distribution function at the starting points of paths 1,2 and 3
are all equal to the value of (40). If contributions from complex paths, such
as path 3, are neglected, we can directly use an ordinary PC-type computer
to calculate (39) on the understanding that the molecular emission rate η
in the formulation has been determined empirically.

5 Conclusion

We have set up a new formalism that exhibits many features strongly dif-
ferent from those related to the standard theory. They can brieﬂy be listed
as the following.

1. Instead of pursuing the exact distribution function, a special type of
distribution function, called the solid-angle-average distribution func-
tion, is introduced. The new-type distribution function can describe
statistical phenomena with any desirable accuracy.

2. Instead of relying on a partial diﬀerential equation, which is diﬃcult
and delicate, the new approach gives a set of tamable integral formulas.
As well known, for a law of nature the integral formulation often enjoys
advantages.

15

3. Instead of disregarding the path-information, the new approach bases
its formulation on the path-information of molecules. With the path-
information included, many sophisticated and important features of
kinetic systems become explicable and treatable.

4. Instead of treating the collisionless Boltzmann gas as a completely
continuous medium, the new approach treats the discontinuity and
quasi-discontinuity at the very beginning. No singularity of any type
exists with the ﬁnal result of the formalism.

5. Instead of falling into the time-reversibility paradox, the new approach
admits its inability to formulate all microscopic details. In treating
boundary eﬀects, the time irreversibility has explicitly been embedded
in the formalism.

The complete dynamics of the Boltzmann gas, including collisional ef-
fects, will be formulated in diﬀerent works[5][11]. Helpful discussion with
Prof. Keying Guan is greatly appreciated. This work is partly supported
by the fund provided by Education Ministry, PRC.

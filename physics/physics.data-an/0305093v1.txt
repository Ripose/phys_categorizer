Abstract

We review recent results on the appearance of long-term persistence in climatic
records and their relevance for the evaluation of global climate models and rare
events. The persistence can be characterized, for example, by the correlation C(s)
of temperature variations separated by s days. We show that, contrary to previous
expectations, C(s) decays for large s as a power law, C(s) ∼ s−γ. For continen-
tal stations, the exponent γ is always close to 0.7, while for stations on islands
γ ∼= 0.4. In contrast to the temperature ﬂuctuations, the ﬂuctuations of the rainfall
usually cannot be characterized by long-term power-law correlations but rather by
pronounced short-term correlations. The universal persistence law for the temper-
ature ﬂuctuations on continental stations represents an ideal (and uncomfortable)
test-bed for the state of-the-art global climate models and allows us to evaluate
their performance. In addition, the presence of long-term correlations leads to a
novel approach for evaluating the statistics of rare events.

1. INTRODUCTION

The persistence of weather states on short terms is a well-known phenomenon: a warm day
is more likely to be followed by a warm day than by a cold day and vice versa. The trivial
forecast that the weather of tomorrow is the same as the weather of today was, in previous
times, often used as a ”minimum skill” forecast for assessing the usefulness of short-term
weather forecasts. The typical time scale for weather changes is about one week, a time
period which corresponds to the average duration of so-called “general weather regimes”
or “Grosswetterlagen”, so this type of short-term persistence usually stops after about
one week. On larger scales, other types of persistence occur, one of them is related to
circulation patterns associated with blocking [5]. A blocking situation occurs when a very
stable high-pressure system is established over a particular region and remains in place for
several weeks. As a result, the weather in the region of the high remains fairly persistent
throughout this period. Furthermore, transient low-pressure systems are deﬂected around
the blocking high so that the region downstream of the high experiences a larger than
usual number of storms. On even longer terms, a source for weather persistence might be
slowly varying external (boundary), forcing such as sea surface temperatures and anomaly
patterns for example. On the scale of months to seasons, one of the most pronounced

1

phenomenon is the El Ni˜no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event, which occurs every three
to ﬁve years and which strongly aﬀects the weather over the tropical Paciﬁc as well as
over North America [21].

The question is, how the persistence, that might be generated by very diﬀerent mech-
anisms on diﬀerent time scales, decays with time s. The answer to this question is not
simple. Correlations, and in particular long-term correlations, can be masked by trends
that are generated, for instance, by the well-known urban warming phenomenon. Even
uncorrelated data in the presence of long-term trends may look like correlated data, and,
on the other hand, long-term correlated data may look like uncorrelated data inﬂuenced
by a trend.

Therefore, in order to distinguish between trends and correlations, one needs methods
that can systematically eliminate trends. Those methods are available now: both wavelet
techniques (WT)1 and detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA)2 can systematically eliminate
trends in the data and thus reveal intrinsic dynamical properties such as distributions,
scaling and long-range correlations that are often masked by nonstationarities.

In recent studies [6, 16, 15, 22] we have used DFA and WT to study temperature and
precipitation correlations in diﬀerent climatic zones on the globe. The results indicate
that the temperature variations are long-range power-law correlated above some crossover
time that is of the order of 10 days. Above 10 d, the persistence, characterized by the
autocorrelation C(s) of temperature variations separated by s days, decays as

C(s) ∼ s−γ,
(1)
where, most interestingly, the exponent γ has roughly the same value γ ∼= 0.7 for all
continental records. For small islands the correlations are more pronounced, with γ around
0.4. This value is close to the value obtained recently for correlations of sea-surface
temperatures [17].
In marked contrast, for most stations the precipitation records do
not show indications of long-range temporal correlations on scales above 6 months. Our
results are supported by independent analysis by several groups [19, 18, 23].

The fact that the correlation exponent varies only very little for the continental atmo-
spheric temperatures, presents an ideal test-bed for the performance of the global climate
models, as we will show below. We present an analysis of the two standard scenarios
(greenhouse gas forcing only and greenhouse gas plus aerosols forcing) together with the
analysis of a control run. Our analysis points to clear deﬁciencies of the models. For fur-
ther discussions we refer to Govindan et al. [8, 9]. Finally, we review a recent approach
to determine the statistics of rare events in the presence of long-term correlations.

The chapter is organized in ﬁve sections.

In Section 2, we describe one of the de-
trending analysis methods, the detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA). In Section 3, we
review the application of this method to both atmospheric temperature and precipitation
records. In Section 4, we describe how the ”universal” persistence law for the atmospheric
temperature ﬂuctuations on continental stations can be used to test the three scenarios
of the state-of-the-art climate models. In Section 5, ﬁnally, we describe how the common
extreme value statistics is modiﬁed in the presence of long-term correlations.

1 THE METHODS OF ANALYSIS

Consider, for example, a record Ti, where the index i counts the days in the record,
i = 1,2,...,N. This record Ti may represent the maximum daily temperature or the daily

2

amount of precipitation, measured at a certain meteorological station. For eliminating
the periodic seasonal trends, we concentrate on the departures of the Ti, ∆Ti = Ti − T i,
from their mean daily value T i for each calendar date i, say 1st of April, which has been
obtained by averaging over all years in the record.

Quantitatively, correlations between two ∆Ti values separated by n days are deﬁned

by the (auto)-correlation function

C(n) ≡ h∆Ti∆Ti+ni =

, ∆Ti∆Ti+n

(2).

N − n

N −n

X
i=1

If the ∆Ti are uncorrelated, C(n) is zero for n positive. If correlations exist up to a certain
number of days n×, the correlation function will be positive up to n× and vanish above
n×. A direct calculation of C(n) is hindered by the level of noise present in the ﬁnite
records, and by possible nonstationarities in the data.

To reduce the noise we do not calculate C(n) directly, but instead study the “proﬁle”

Ym =

∆Ti.

m

X
i=1

(3).

We can consider the proﬁle Ym as the position of a random walker on a linear chain
after m steps. The random walker starts at the origin and performs, in the ith step,
a jump of length ∆Ti to the right if ∆Ti is positive, and to the left if ∆Ti is negative.
The ﬂuctuations F 2(s) of the proﬁle, in a given time window of size s, are related to the
correlation function C(s). For the relevant case (1) of long-term power-law correlations,
C(s) ∼ s−γ,
0 < γ < 1, the mean-square ﬂuctuations F 2(s), obtained by averaging over
many time windows of size s (see below) asymptotically increase by a power law [3],

F 2(s) ∼ s2α, α = 1 − γ/2.

(3)

For uncorrelated data (as well as for correlations decaying faster than 1/s), we have
α = 1/2.

For the analysis of the ﬂuctuations, we employ a hierarchy of methods that diﬀer in
the way the ﬂuctuations are measured and possible trends are eliminated (for a detailed
description of the methods we refer to Kantelhardt et al. [14]).

1.) In the simplest type of ﬂuctuation analysis (FA) (where trends are not going to be
eliminated), we determine the diﬀerence of the proﬁle at both ends of each window. The
square of this diﬀerence represents the square of the ﬂuctuations in each window.

2.) In the ﬁrst-order detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA1), we determine in each
window the best linear ﬁt of the proﬁle. The variance of the proﬁle from this straight line
represents the square of the ﬂuctuations in each window.

3.) In general, in the nth order DFA (DFAn) we determine in each window the best nth
order polynomial ﬁt of the proﬁle. The variance of the proﬁle from these best nth-order
polynomials represents the square of the ﬂuctuations in each window.

By deﬁnition, FA does not eliminate trends similar to the Hurst method and the
conventional power spectral methods [7]. In contrast, DFAn eliminates trends of order
n in the proﬁle and n − 1 in the original time series. Thus, from the comparison of
ﬂuctuation functions F (s) obtained from diﬀerent methods, one can learn about long-
term correlations and types of trends, which cannot be achieved by the conventional
techniques.

2. ANALYSIS OF TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION
RECORDS

Figure 1 shows the results of the FA and DFA analysis of the maximum daily temper-
atures Ti of the following weather stations (the length of the records is written within
the parentheses): (a) Cheyenne (USA, 123 y), (b) Edinburgh (UK, 102 y), (c) Campbell
Island (New Zealand, 57 y), and (d) Sonnblick (Austria, 108 y). The results are typical
for a large number of records that we have analyzed so far (see Eichner et al. [6] and
Koscielny-Bunde et al. [16, 15]). Cheyenne has a continental climate, Edinburgh is on a
coastline, Campbell Island is a small island in the Paciﬁc Ocean, and the weather station
of Sonnblick is on top of a mountain.

In the log-log plots, all curves are (except at small s values) approximately straight
lines. For both the stations inside the continents and along coastlines, the slope is
α ∼= 0.65. There exists a natural crossover (above the DFA crossover) that can be best
estimated from FA and DFA1. As can be veriﬁed easily, the crossover occurs roughly
at tc = 10d, which is the order of magnitude for a typical Grosswetterlage. Above tc,
there exists long-range persistence expressed by the power-law decay of the correlation
function with an exponent γ = 2 − 2α ∼= 0.7. These results are representative for the large
number of records we have analyzed. They indicate that the exponent is ”universal” , i.e.,
does not depend on the location and the climatic zone of the weather station. Below tc,

Figure 2: Analysis of daily precipitation records of four representative weather stations.
The four ﬁgures show the ﬂuctuation functions obtained by FA, DFA1, DFA2, DFA3,
DFA4, and DFA5 (from top to bottom) for the four sets of data. The scale of the
ﬂuctuation functions is arbitrary. In each panel, a line with slope 0.5 is shown as a guide

the ﬂuctuation functions do not show universal behavior and reﬂect the diﬀerent climatic
zones.

However, there are exceptions from the universal behavior, and these occur for loca-
tions on small islands and on top of large mountains. In the ﬁrst case, the exponent can
be considerably larger, α ∼= 0.8, corresponding to γ ∼= 0.4. In the second case, on top of
a mountain, the exponent can be smaller, α ∼= 0.58, corresponding to γ ∼= 0.84.

Next we consider precipitation records. Figure 2 shows the results of the FA and DFA
analysis of the daily precipitation Pi of the following weather stations (the length of the
records is written within the parentheses): (a) Cheyenne (USA, 117 y), (b) Edinburgh
(UK, 102 y), (c) Campbell Island (New Zealand, 57 y), and (d) Sonnblick (Austria, 108
y). The results are typical and represent a large number of records that we have analyzed
so far [22]).

In the log-log plots, all curves are (except at small s values) approximately straight
lines at large times, with a slope close to 0.5. If there exist long-term correlations, then
they are very small. Some exceptions are again stations on top of a mountain, where
the exponent might be around 0.6, but this happens only very rarely. In most cases, the
exponent is between 0.5 and 0.55, pointing to uncorrelated or weakly correlated behavior
at large time spans. Unlike the temperature records, the exponents actually do not depend
on speciﬁc climatic or geographic conditions.

precipitation records. Diﬀerent climatological conditions are marked in the histograms.
First we concentrate on the temperature records (ﬁg. 3a). One can see clearly that for
stations that are neither on islands nor on summits, the average exponent is close 0.65,
with a variance of 0.03. For the islands (where only few records are available) the average
value of α is 0.78, with quite a large variance of 0.08. The variance is large, since stations
on larger islands, like Wrangelija, behave more like continental stations, with an exponent
close to 0.65. For the precipitation records (ﬁg. 3b), the average exponent α is close to
0.54, with a variance close to 0.05, and does not depend signiﬁcantly on the climatic
conditions around a weather station.

Since for the temperature records the exponent for continental and coastline stations
does not depend on the location of the meteorological station and its local environment,
the power-law behavior can serve as an ideal test for climate models where regional details
cannot be incorporated and therefore regional phenomena like urban warming cannot be
accounted for. The power-law behavior seems to be a global phenomenon and therefore
should also show up in the simulated data of the global climate models (GCM).

3. TEST OF GLOBAL CLIMATE MODELS

The state-of-the-art climate models that are used to estimate future climate are coupled
atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) [10, 12]. The models provide
numerical solutions of the Navier Stokes equations devised for simulating meso-scale to
large-scale atmospheric and oceanic dynamics. In addition to the explicitly resolved scales

6

of motions, the models also contain parameterization schemes representing the so-called
subgrid-scale processes, such as radiative transfer, turbulent mixing, boundary layer pro-
cesses, cumulus convection, precipitation, and gravity wave drag. A radiative transfer
scheme, for example, is necessary for simulating the role of various greenhouse gases such
as CO2 and the eﬀect of aerosol particles. The diﬀerences among the models usually lie
in the selection of the numerical methods employed, the choice of the spatial resolution3,
and the subgrid-scale parameters.

Three scenarios have been studied by the models, and the results are available, for
four models, from the IPCC Data Distribution Center [13]. The ﬁrst scenario represents
a control run where the CO2 content is kept ﬁxed. In the second scenario, one considers
only the eﬀect of greenhouse gas forcing (GHG). The amount of greenhouse gases is taken
from the observations until 1990 and then increased at a rate of 1% per year.
In the
third scenario, the eﬀect of aerosols (mainly sulfates) in the atmosphere is taken into
account. Only direct sulfate forcing is considered; until 1990, the sulfate concentrations
are taken from historical measurements , and are increased linearly afterwards. The eﬀect
of sulfates is to mitigate and partially oﬀset the greenhouse gas warming. Although
this scenario represents an important step towards comprehensive climate simulation, it
introduces new uncertainties - regarding the distributions of natural and anthropogenic
aerosols and, in particular, regarding indirect eﬀects on the radiation balance through
cloud-cover modiﬁcation etc. [11].

For the test, we consider the monthly temperature records from those four AOGCMs.
Data for these three scenarios are available from the Internet: CSIRO-Mk2 (Melbourne),
CCSR/NIES (Tokyo), ECHAM4/OPYC3 (Hamburg), and CGCM1 (Victoria, Canada).
We extracted the data for six representative sites around the globe (Prague, Kasan, Seoul,
Luling [Texas], Vancouver, and Melbourne). For each model and each of the three scenar-
ios, we selected the temperature records of the four grid points closest to each site, and
bilinearly interpolated the data to the location of the site. Figure 4 shows representative
results of the ﬂuctuation functions, calculated using DFA3, for two sites (Kasan [Russia]
and Luling [Texas]) for the four models and the three scenarios. As seen in ﬁgure 4 most
of the DFA curves approach the slope of 0.5. However, the control runs seem to show a
somewhat better performance, i.e., many of them have a slope close to 0.65 (e.g., Luling
(CSIRO-Mk2)), and the greenhouse gas only scenario show the worst performance. The
actual long-term exponents α for the three scenarios of the 4 models for the 6 cities are
summarized in ﬁgure 5(a)-(c). Each histogram consists of 24 blocks and every block is
speciﬁed by the model and the city.

For the control run (ﬁg. 5(a)) there is a peak at α ∼= 0.65 but more than half of
the exponents are below α ∼= 0.62. For the greenhouse gas only scenario (ﬁg. 5(b)), the
histogram shows a pronounced maximum at α = 0.5. For best performance, all models
should have exponents α close to 0.65, corresponding to a peak of height 24 in the window
between 0.62 and 0.68. Actually, more than half of the exponents are close to 0.5, while
only 3 exponents are in the proper window between 0.62 and 0.68. Figure 5(c) shows
the histogram for the greenhouse gas plus aerosol scenario, where, in addition to the
greenhouse gas forcing, also the eﬀects of aerosols are taken into account. For this case,
there is a pronounced maximum in the α window between 0.56 and 0.62 (more than half
of the exponents are in this window), while again only 3 exponents are in the proper range
between 0.62 and 0.68. This shows that although the greenhouse gas plus aerosol scenario
is also far from reproducing the scaling behavior of the real data, its overall performance

is observed for the control run, which points to remarkable deﬁciencies in the way the
forcings are introduced into the models.

4. EXTREME VALUE STATISTICS

The long-term correlations in a record {Ti} eﬀect strongly the statistics of the extreme
values in the record, as has been shown recently in [2]. The central quantity in Extreme
Value Statistics (EVS) is the return time rq between two events of size greater or equal to
a certain threshold q. The basic assumption in conventional EVS is, that the events are
uncorrelated (at least when the time lag between them is suﬃciently large). In this case,
one can obtain the mean return time Rq simply from the probability Wq that an event
greater or equal to q occurs, Rq = 1/Wq. Since the events are uncorrelated, also the
return intervals are uncorrelated and follow the Poisson-statistics; i.e. their distribution
function Pq(r) is a simple exponential, Pq(r) ∼ exp(−r/Rq).

For long-term correlations, it has been shown in [2] that the distribution function Pq(r)

changes into a stretched exponential function,

Pq(r) ∼ exp[−const(r/Rq)γ)],

(4)

for γ between zero and one. For γ above one, in the case of short-term correlations, Pq
reduces to the Poisson distribution.

In addition, the return intervals become long-term correlated, with an exponent that
is approximately identical to γ [2]. This is seen in Fig. 6, where the ﬂuctuation functions
F (s) of the return intervals (obtained by DFA2) are shown for two artiﬁcial long-term

Figure 6: Fluctuation functions F (s) for the record of return intervals obtained from two
artiﬁcial long-term correlated records {Ti} with γ = 0.4 (upper curves) and γ = 0.7
(lower curves). The distribution of the Ti values has been chosen as Gaussian, with zero
mean and variance one. For the return intervals, the thresholds q = 1.5 and 2.5 have
been considered. The straight lines in the ﬁgure have slopes α = 1 − γ/2, suggesting
that the return intervals are long-term correlated in the same way as the Ti

correlated records with γ = 0.4 and 0.7. Two values of thresholds q = 1.5 and 2.5 have
been considered for each value of γ. The distribution of Ti values has been chosen as
Gaussian, with zero mean and variance one. In the double logarithmic plot, all the curves
approach straight lines with slopes α = 1 − γ/2, suggesting that the return intervals are
long-term correlated in the same way as the Ti.

As a consequence, small return intervals are more likely to be followed by small inter-
vals and large intervals are more likely to be followed by large intervals. Accordingly, for
long-term correlated records it is more likely than for uncorrelated records that a sequence
of large return times is followed by a sequence of short return times.

This fact may be relevant for the occurence of ﬂoods.

It is well known that river
ﬂows are long-term correlated with exponents γ between 0.3 and 0.9, in most cases close
to 0.4. In the last decades, the frequency of large ﬂoods in Europe has increased. It is
possible, that this increase is due to global warming, but it is also possible that it has
been triggered by the long-term correlations.

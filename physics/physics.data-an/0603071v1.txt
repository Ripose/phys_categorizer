Abstract

The statistics of return distributions on various time scales constitutes one of the
most informative characteristics of the ﬁnancial dynamics. Here we present a sys-
tematic study of such characteristics for the Polish stock market index WIG20 over
the period 04.01.1999–31.10.2005 for the time lags ranging from one minute up to
one hour. This market is commonly classiﬁed as emerging. Still on the shortest time
scales studied we ﬁnd that the tails of the return distributions are consistent with
the inverse cubic power-law, as identiﬁed previously for majority of the mature mar-
kets. Within the time scales studied a quick and considerable departure from this
law towards a Gaussian can however be traced. Interestingly, all the forms of the
distributions observed can be comprised by the single q-Gaussians which provide
a satisfactory and at the same time compact representation of the distribution of
return ﬂuctuations over all magnitudes of their variation. The corresponding nonex-
tensivity parameter q is found to systematically decrease when increasing the time
scales.

1 Introduction

Making the quantiﬁcation of ﬁnancial ﬂuctuations is a real interdisciplinary
challenge. The related well identiﬁed stylised fact is the so-called inverse cubic
power-law [1] which applies to developed stock markets [2,3,4,5], to the com-
modity market [6], as well as to the most traded currency exchange rates [7].
The emerging stock markets are commonly considered to be governed by a
somewhat diﬀerent dynamics which often [8,9] results in exponential tails of
the return distributions. Of course, both the above types of distributions are

Levy unstable and thus for the suﬃciently long time lags they may converge
towards a Gaussian. The distribution with an exponential tail might corre-
spond to an intermediate stage between a distribution with the power-law
asymptotics and a very large time lag limit - a Gaussian [10]. Such a scenario
corresponds for instance to the Heston model [11].

In order to elaborate more on this sort of issues we systematically study the
character of ﬂuctuations of the Polish stock market as represented by the
WIG20 index. This equity market started trading on April 16, 1991 and the
presently most often quoted corresponding index is WIG20 (Warszawski In-
dex Gie ldowy - Warsaw Stock Market Index), introduced in 1994, comprising
capitalization weighted prices of the 20 largest companies. The high quality
electronic processing and recording of all the transactions started in the be-
ginning of 1999. The analysis presented here thus covers the time period since
January 4, 1999 until October 31, 2005.

Fig. 1. NASDAQ, S&P500 and WIG20(Warsaw Stock Exchange) index from
1999.01.04 until 2005.10.31.

The daily trading closing hour during this period was 4:00pm and since 17.11.2000
4:10pm. The opening hours have been changed two times. On 4.1.1999 until
30.7.1999 (Period1) it was 1pm, then until 16.11.2000 (Period2) it was 12am,
and then 10am (Period3) with the closing at 4:10pm.
As it can be seen from Fig. 1 in the whole time period inspected here, even
though representing an emerging market, the WIG20 has been following the
overall world trend - more in terms of the phase than in the amplitude how-
ever. During the ﬁrst two years of the period considered its behavior closely

resembles the Nasdaq. Starting in 2003 it however by far overperforms the
two world major indices: the Nasdaq and the S&P500. As natural, the orig-
inal WIG20 is quoted in the Polish Zloty (PLN). Converting systematically
the PLN into the US$ - to make this comparison even more informative -
results in an even larger gain as can be easily seen from Fig. 1. This is due to
a parallel sizable PLN appreciation in the period considered.

2 Conventional log-log analysis

For the time series W (t) representing the index value at time t we use the
commonly accepted deﬁnition of returns as

R

R(t, ∆t) = ln W (t + ∆t)

ln W (t).

≡

−

As another standard procedure, we calculate the normalized returns r
r(t, ∆t) deﬁned as

≡

R

r =

R

iT

,

− h
v

≡
v2 =

h

iT − h

R

2
T

i

where v

v(∆t) is the standard deviation of returns over the period T

and

. . .

h

iT denotes a time average.

The cumulative distribution functional (cdf) of ∆t = 1min moduli of WIG20
returns collected from the whole period 1999 - 2005 speciﬁed above is shown
in panel (a) of Fig. 2. Interestingly, this distribution displays very similar
behavior as for many mature markets analysed before. Even the tails of this
distribution reveal scaling

consistent in addition with the inverse cubic power law (α = 3). The remain-
ing (b), (c) and (d) panels show cdf’s separately for the Period1, Period2 and
Period3. As one can see, even though these periods correspond to diﬀerent
phases - from less to more advanced - of the Polish Stock Market develop-
ment, the return distribution characteristics remain essentially invariant. This
indicates that the ﬂuctuation characteristics of an emerging market do not
have to diﬀer from those of a mature one. A distribution whose tails follow

−

the inverse cubic power law has a ﬁnite second moment and is thus Levy
unstable. In the present context this means that the return distributions for
the suﬃciently large time lags ∆t are expected to eventually start converging
towards a Gaussian due to eﬀects in the spirit of the Central Limit Theorem
(CLT). Of course, ﬂuctuations typically carry some higher order time correla-
tions - quantiﬁable for instance in terms of multifractals [12,13] - therefore this
convergence may be much slower than for uncorrelated stochastic processes
to which the conventional CLT refers. For the stock market ﬂuctuations such
eﬀects are however identiﬁed in the literature [3,4] for the time scales of the
order of a few days or even a few hours for the more recent data [5]. How the
corresponding situation develops for our WIG20 data when the time lag ∆t
increases is shown in Fig. 3.
Departure from the inverse cubic scaling can already be seen for time lags
larger than 10 minutes and for ∆t = 60 min the scaling regime is hardly

4

visible with the tail of the distribution being closer to a Gaussian.

Fig. 3. Cumulative distributions of moduli of the WIG20 normalized returns (sym-
bols) from 4 Jan 1999 to 31 Oct 2005 for several time scales: 1 min (△), 2 min ((cid:13)), 4
min (▽), 8 min ((cid:3)), 16 min (•), 32 min ((cid:3)), and 60 min ((cid:4)). Dashed line corresponds
to a Gaussian distribution.

Whether this much faster convergence with ∆t towards a normal distribution
is characteristic to WIG20 ﬂuctuations or it just reﬂects the fact that one
deals here with even more recent data than in ref. [5] remains an open ques-
tion. Based on empirical arguments collected form the world leading stock
markets the hypothesis put forward in that reference says that when going
from past to present the same ∆t measured by a conventional clock time ef-
fectively corresponds to increasing time lags of an internal market time and
this originates form an increasing speed of the information processing.

3 Nonextensive statistical approach

The fat tails in the ﬁnancial return distributions and the complex character
of the underlying temporal correlations [12,13,14,15] indicate that the con-
ventional concept of ergodicity may break down in the ﬁnancial dynamics.

5

Under such circumstances the generalised formalism of nonextensive statis-
tical mechanics may oﬀer an appropriate framework to quantify the corre-
sponding statistics. At present the most consistent seems the one based on
the generalised entropy which for a set of N events
characterised by the
probabilities

reads

{

pi}

{

Xi=1

i lnq pi,

as postulated by Tsallis [16]. Here lnq denotes the q- logarithm function

lnq x = (x1−q

1)/(1

q).

−

−

The parameter q in Eq. 5 is the so called nonextensivity parameter. For q = 1
this equation expresses the standard Bolzmann-Gibbs entropy.

The optimization of this generalized entropic form under appropriate con-
straints [16,17], in the continuous form, yields the following q-Gaussian form
for the distribution of probabilities

p (x) =

Nq e−Bq(x−¯µq)2

Another argument which makes this distribution attractive from the present
perspective is that for q > 1 it asymptotically (x >> 1) develops a power law
form p(x)
1−q . In particular, for q = 3/2, on the level of the cumulative
distribution, it recovers the inverse cubic power law. This is an especially
nice aspect of the functional form expressed by the Eq. 6 because it at the
same time provides a compact form for the probability distribution for any
value of x. Indeed, the ﬁrst attempts [18] of the applicability of this form
to describe the probability distributions of the ﬁnancial ﬂuctuations turn out

6

(8)

(9)

quite promising. For all these reasons in the following we explore a possibility
to describe the empirical WIG20 return distributions presented in Fig. 3 by a
family of the q-Gaussians. In order however to attain a better stability of this
analysis, instead of directly using the Eq. 6 we convert it to the cumulative
form by deﬁning

P±(x) =

p(x′)dx′

where the + and - signs correspond to the right and left wings of the distri-
bution correspondingly. By using here the Eq. 6 one obtains

Fig. 4 shows the cumulative variant of the WIG20 data points for the same
sequence of the time lags as in Fig. 3 and the corresponding best theoreti-
cal ﬁts in terms of Eq. 9. The result appears very encouraging. For a given
∆t one obtains a good theoretical representation for the empirical probabil-
ity distribution over the whole interval of changes of the returns. The only
inaccuracy is at small ∆t for a few positive and even more negative extreme
events whose probability is somewhat lower than what the overall global ﬁt
provides. Nevertheless, the obtained q-values for the smallest ∆t are close to
3/2, as consistent with the inverse cubic power law. With increasing ∆t the
best ﬁt q-values systematically decrease and the corresponding q-Gaussians
provide amazingly reasonable representation for the empirical data on all the
time scales considered.

The main conclusion to be drawn from the analysis presented above is that the

Fig. 4. Cumulative distributions of normalized returns (symbols) for WIG20 index
(Warsaw Stock Exchange) from 4 Jan 1999 to 31 Oct 2005 for several time scales.
Solid line represents the best theoretical ﬁt corresponding to Eq. 9, from top to
bottom: q = 1.46 (∆t = 1 min, △), q = 1.44 (∆t = 2 min, (cid:13)), q = 1.435 (∆t = 4
min, ▽), q = 1.425 (∆t = 8 min, (cid:3)), q = 1.41 (∆t = 16 min, •), q = 1.395 (∆t = 32
min, (cid:3)), and q = 1.37 (∆t = 60 min, (cid:4)). Dashed line corresponds to a Gaussian
distribution. The curves have been rescaled vertically for better display.

lis entropy seems to oﬀer the best theoretical framework to compactly quantify
the probability distributions of the stock market ﬂuctuations on various time
scales. This observation may appear helpful in formulating a generalised CLT
when the summed stochastic variables - like the ﬁnancial once - are not com-
pletely uncorrelated. It also gives further support to the option pricing [19,20]
models based on the q-Gaussians [21]. This analysis has been performed for
the Warsaw Stock Market WIG20 high frequency recordings. Even though
commonly considered as emerging this market displays ﬂuctuation character-
istics typical for the mature markets. The returns distribution for the small
time lags conforms well to the inverse cubic power law. However, the departure
from this law when increasing the time lags is seen to be faster than for any
market presented so far in the literature. None of those previous studies for

8

other markets refers however to such a recent time period and it is likely that
going from past to present eﬀectively contracts the time scales characteristic
to the internal market dynamics and a similar eﬀect may be seen for the other
markets as well [5]. This is an interesting issue for further study.

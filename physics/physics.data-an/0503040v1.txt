A new technique is introduced to reconstruct a nonlinear stochastic model of the cardiorespiratory
interaction.
Its inferential framework uses a set of polynomial basis functions representing the
nonlinear force governing the system oscillations. The strength and direction of coupling, and the
noise intensity are simultaneously inferred from a univariate blood pressure signal, monitored in
a clinical environment. The technique does not require extensive global optimization and it is
applicable to a wide range of complex dynamical systems subject to noise.

Keywords: Dynamical inference, nonlinear time-series analysis, cardio-respiratory interaction

Heart rate variability (HRV) is an important dynam-
ical phenomenon in physiology. Altered HRV is associ-
ated with a range of cardiovascular diseases and increased
mortality [1], and its parameters are starting to be used
as a basis for diagnostic tests. However, signals acquired
from the human cardiovascular system (CVS), being de-
rived from a living organism, arise through the interac-
tion of many dynamical degrees of freedom and processes
with diﬀerent time scales [2]. Thus HRV is attributable
to the mutual interaction of a large number of oscillatory
processes. Among them, the eﬀect of respiration on heart
rate has been the most intensively studied. The physio-
logical mechanisms have recently been reviewed [3] and
include e.g. modulation of the cardiac ﬁlling pressure as a
result of changes of intrathoracic pressure during respira-
tory movements [4], direct respiratory ordering of auto-
nomic outﬂow [3], and baroreceptor feedback control [5].

An important feature of these processes is that they
are nonlinear, time-varying, and subject to ﬂuctuations
[6, 7, 8]. For such systems deterministic techniques fail
to yield accurate parameter estimates [9]. Additionally,
models of the cardiovascular interactions are not usually
known exactly from ﬁrst principles and one is faced with
a rather broad range of possible parametric models to
consider [5, 10]. Inverse approaches, in which dynami-
cal properties are analysed from measured data have re-
cently been considered. A variety of numerical techniques
have been introduced to analyse cardio-respiratory inter-
actions using e.g. linear approximations [11], estimations
of either the strength of some of the nonlinear terms [12],
the occurrence of cardio-respiratory synchronization [13]
or the directionality of coupling [14]. Hitherto, modelling
approaches have not been used interactively in conjunc-
tion with time series analysis methods. Rather, the latter
have each focussed on a particular dynamical property,
e.g. synchronization, or nonlinearities, or directionality.

In this Letter we introduce an approach to the prob-
lem that combines mathematical modelling of system dy-
namics and extraction of model parameters directly from
measured time series. In this way we estimate simulta-
neously the strength, directionality of coupling and noise

intensity in the cardio-respiratory interaction. The tech-
nique reconstructs the nonlinear system dynamics in the
presence of ﬂuctuations.
In addition, the method pro-
vides optimal compensation of dynamical noise-induced
errors for continuous systems while avoiding extensive
numerical optimization. We demonstrate the approach
by using a univariate blood pressure (BP) signal for
reconstruction of a nonlinear stochastic model of the
cardio-respiratory interaction. The results are veriﬁed
by analysis of data synthesized from the inferred model.
The problems faced in the analysis of CVS variability
are common, not only to all living systems, but also to
all complex systems subject to ﬂuctuations, e.g. molec-
ular motors [15] or coupled matter–radiation systems in
astrophysics [16]. Yet there are no general methods for
the dynamical inference of stochastic nonlinear systems.
Thus the technique introduced in this paper will be of
wide applicability.

We use public domain data to illustrate the idea.
We analyse central venous blood pressure data, record
24 of the MGH/MF Waveform Database available at
www.physionet.org. Its spectrum, shown in Fig. 1(a),
exhibits two basic frequencies corresponding to the res-
piratory, fr ≈ 0.2 Hz, and cardiac, fc ≈ 1.7 Hz, oscilla-
tions; the higher frequency peaks are the 2nd, 3rd and
4th harmonics of the cardiac oscillation. We note that
the relative intensity and position of these peaks vary
from subject to subject, with the average frequencies for
healthy subjects at rest being around 0.2 and 1.1 Hz for
respiration and heart rate respectively.

We must bear in mind that CVS power spectra also
contain lower frequency components [1, 17]. In practice,
parametric modelling is usually restricted to a speciﬁc
part of the power spectrum. Because our interest here
centres on the cardio-respiratory interaction, we select
for study the frequency range that includes the main
harmonics of cardiac and respiratory oscillations fc and
fr and their combinational frequencies as shown in Fig.
1(b).
In addition, we assume that the two higher ba-
sic frequency components observed in all CVS signals
[8, 19] can be separated. Hence the blood pressure sig-

nal can be considered in the ﬁrst approximation as a
sum of the cardiac and respiratory oscillatory compo-
nents s(t) = sc(t) + sr(t). Accordingly, we use a com-
bination of zero-phase forward and reverse digital ﬁl-
tering based on Butterworth ﬁlters to decompose [18]
the blood pressure signal into 2-dimensional time series
{s(tk) = (sc(tk), sr(tk)), tk = kh, k = 0 : K}. The time
series represent the contributions of cardiac and respira-
tory oscillations to the blood pressure on a discrete time
grid. A window consisting of 18000 points of the origi-
nal signal, sampled at 360 Hz, was resampled at 90 Hz.
Hence the signal considered for inference was of length
500 s, with a step size of h = 1/90 sec.

Following the suggestion of coupled oscillators [8, 19],
we now choose the simplest model that can reproduce
this type of oscillation: two nonlinearly coupled systems
with limit cycles on a plane

˙xc = a2xc + yc,

that includes nonlinear coupling terms up to 3rd order.
We assume that the measurement noise can be neglected.
The two dynamical variables of the model (1), xr(t)
and xc(t) correspond to the two-dimensional time-series,
s(t) = {sr(t), sc(t)}, introduced above. Using (1) the
remaining two dynamical variables y(t) = {yr(t), yc(t)}
can be related to the observations {s(tk)} as follows

where n = r, c. Parametric presentation (1) with a spe-
cial form of embedding (3) allows one to infer a wide
class of dynamical models including e.g. the van der Pol
and FitzHugh-Nagumo models. Furthermore, it allows
physiological interpretation of the model parameters.

Using (3) we can reduce the original problem of char-
acterizing the cardio-respiratory interaction to that of
inferring the set of unknown parameters M = {c, ˆD} of
the coupled stochastic nonlinear diﬀerential equations

The model parameters can be obtained by use of our
novel method of dynamical inference of stochastic nonlin-
ear models. The method is based on the Bayesian tech-
nique. Details, and a comparison with the results of ear-
lier research, are given elsewhere [20]. Here we describe
brieﬂy the main steps in applying the method to inference
of cardio-respiratory interactions. First, one has to deﬁne
the so-called likelihood function ℓ(y|M): the probability
density to observe the dynamical variables y(t) under the
condition that the underlying dynamical model (4) has a
given set of parameters M. We suggest that, for a uni-
form sampling scheme and a suﬃciently small time step
h, one can use results from [21] to write the logarithm of
the likelihood function as

Note that the form of (6) diﬀers from the cost function
in the method of least-squares: the term involving v pro-
vides optimal compensation of noise-induced errors [20].
In the next step one has to summarize a priori expert
knowledge about the model parameters in the so-called
prior PDF, ppr(M). We assume ppr(M) to be Gaus-
sian with respect to the elements of c and uniform with
respect to the elements of ˆD.

Finally, one can use the measured time-series y to im-
prove the a priori estimation of the model parameters.
The improved knowledge is summarized in the posterior
conditional PDF ppost(M|y), which is related to the prior
PDF via Bayes’ theorem

ppost(M|y) =

ℓ(y|M) ppr(M)
ℓ(y|M) ppr(M) dM

.

For a suﬃciently large number of observations, ppost is
sharply peaked at a certain most probable model M =
M∗, providing a solution to the inference problem.

To ﬁnd this solution we substitute the prior ppr(M)
and the likelihood ℓ(y|M) into (7) and perform the op-
timization by diﬀerentiation of the resulting expression
with respect to ˆDnn′

We emphasize that a number of important parameters of
the decomposition of the original signal (e.g. the band-
width, order of the ﬁlters and scaling parameters aki)
have to be selected to provide the best ﬁt to the measured
time series {s(tk)}. The parameters of the model (4) can
now be inferred directly from the measured time series
of blood pressure, yielding the values shown in the ﬁrst

oscillations are β20 = 2.2, β21 = 0.27, β22 = −8.67, and
D22 = 8.13 ; here we use a double-indexing scheme for
the coeﬃcients of the linear expansion (2), the scheme
being evident from the caption in Table I. It is clear that
there is a close resemblance between the peaks at the
basic and combinational frequencies, nfc + mfr, in the
power-spectra. A similarly close resemblance is found for
respiratory oscillations, sr(t) and xr(t), respectively (not
shown).

The frequency content can be reproduced from a uni-
variate signal s(t) because for fr ≪ fc it can be written
in the form: s(t) ≈ sr(t)+Ac(t) cos(fct+θc(t))+. . ., here
Ac(t), θc(t) are slow amplitude and phase and the omit-
ted terms oscillate at multiples of fc. Fast-oscillating
terms in this expansion correspond to a cardiac signal
sc(t) and this ensures the validity of the signal decompo-
sition s(t) = sr(t)+sc(t), with components corresponding
to weakly coupled nonlinear oscillators.

coeﬃcients inferred from measured data. The middle row rep-
resents coeﬃcients inferred from synthesized data, obtained as
an average of 100 non-overlapped 1600 s blocks. Each block
includes 160000 points with a sampling time 0.01 sec. The
estimation error is shown in the bottom line.

To validate these results we consider a synthesized sig-

nal x(t) = xr(t) + xc(t) where xr(t), xc(t) are obtained
using numerical simulations of the model (1) with the
parameters taken from the inference. We now repeat the
full inference procedure to estimate nonlinear coupling
parameters in (1) by using the synthesized univariate sig-
nal x(t) as a time-series data input s(t). This gives us the
following estimates for the parameters of cardiac oscilla-
tions β20 = 6.32, β21 = 0.49, β22 = 6.03, and D22 = 3.44,
which diﬀer from the values in the ﬁrst row of Table I,
but provides a correct estimation of the order of magni-
tude of the absolute values of the measured parameters.
The main source of error here is the fact that we have to
reconstruct the state of multidimensional system using
the univariate signal.

If the state of the system was known the accu-
racy of inference could be arbitrary high [20]. To il-
lustrate this point we use the synthesized time-series
{xr(t), xc(t), yr(t), yc(t)} as bivariate data for two cou-
pled oscillators to infer parameters of the model (1). The
results are summarized in the second row of Table I. It
can be seen that the values of the parameters can be esti-
mated with relative error of less than 10%. In particular,
the relative error of estimation of the noise intensity is
now below 4%. The accuracy of the estimation can be
further improved by increasing the total time of observa-
tion of the system dynamics. The decomposition problem
could of course be eliminated by using bivariate cardio-
vascular data, which are now commonly available.

The relative magnitudes of the parameters obtained,
|βi| > |αi|, indicate that respiration inﬂuences cardiac ac-
tivity more strongly than vice versa, consistent with the
results of methods speciﬁcally developed for detecting the
coupling directionality of interacting oscillators [14], and
with direct physiological observations. Furthermore, the
presence of non-zero quadratic terms is consistent with
recent results obtained by time-phase bispectral analysis
[12]. The frequency and amplitude variability of the main
oscillatory components [8] is implicitly captured within

4

the coupling terms and noise. We ﬁnd that the present
model class is able to reproduce, not only the coupling
directionality, but also to a large extent the 1:7 and 1:8
cardio-respiratory synchronization properties of the mea-
sured data, as will be discussed in detail elsewhere.

We would like to mention that reported method is only
a ﬁrst step in the direction of developing path-integral
based approach to the dynamical inference of stochastic
nonlinear models. It was veriﬁed on a number of model
systems and has demonstrated stable and reliable infer-
ence of a broad class of models with high accuracy (see
e.g. [20]). However, the method in its present form has a
number of limitations. For example, to include frequen-
cies lower then the frequency of respiration as well as to
account for feedback mechanism of control from the ner-
vous system will require for an extension of the model
class used in the paper.
In particular, it will require
to include new degrees of freedom, time-delay functions
and non-polynomial basis functions, possibly a non-white
noise and non-parametric model inference. However, the
technique can be readily extended to encompass men-
tioned above situations.

In summary, we have solved a long-standing problem
in physiology: inference of a nonlinear model of cardio-
respiratory interactions in the presence of ﬂuctuations.
Our technique estimates simultaneously the strength and
directionality of coupling, and the noise intensity in the
cardio-respiratory interaction, directly from measured
time series.
It can in principle also be applied to any
physiological signal. Our solution is facilitated by an an-
alytic derivation of the likelihood function that optimally
compensates noise-induced errors in continuous dynam-
ical systems.
It has enabled us to eﬀect the ﬁrst ap-
plication of nonlinear stochastic inference to identify a
dynamical model from real data.

Abstract

We show, using various examples, that the decoherence and “physicalization”
of an unencountered-before phenomena proceeds through the same stages of
computer simulation and that one may use the known procedure of the latter
in order to learn about the former. We use the example of programming and
webmastering Internet websites that refer to known physical phenomena such
as the harmonic oscillator and the energy shift (known from quantum ﬁeld
theory). We also discuss the classical cylinder and pistons used to measure
entropy in classical thermodynamics.

I. INTRODUCTION

Nowadays, there is almost no scientist that does not exploit the advantages oﬀered by the
computer. It is accepted [1] that the valid scientiﬁc theories, especially the physical ones
[2], are also valid in their numerical simulated forms on the screen and vice versa. Thus, a
parallelism may be drawn between the various stages in physical theories of ﬁrst proposing
the scientiﬁc theory (writing the relevant equations), then testing it through experiments
and ﬁnally of validating (or refuting) it to the corresponding steps in computer simulations
of ﬁrst writing the program, then running it and ﬁnally of validating (or disproving) it on the
computer screen. This parallelism between the two processes is especially emphasized in the
experimentation and validation (or refutation) stages except for the diﬀerences due to their
diﬀerent characters. That is, whereas the physical theories are proved or refuted through real
experiments performed in the (three-dimensional) laboratory, in the numerical simulations
the related experiments are the running of the involved programs on the (two-dimensional)
computer screen.

We focus in this work our attention on the correspondence between the physical theories
and computer simulations at the very initial stage of explaining, by the assumed mathe-
matical expressions, a ﬁrstly-met physical phenomena, and writing the computer program
respectively. We note that in the simulation process the stage of writing the program depends
exclusively on the writer which is not prevented from writing anything except the syntactic
rules of the computer language he uses. That is, the sole reason for the possible failure
of a computer program, as realized in the compilation process, is rooted in its erroneous
code that does not conform to the syntactic rules of the used computer language. Thus,
the programmer, actually, creates, through the relevant program, any form displayed on the
screen. The natural physical phenomena, on the other hand, are believed not to depend
upon either the relevant equations or upon the observers (scientists) that propose and write
them. That is, the observers that describe these phenomena, for the ﬁrst time, through
the relevant equations are regarded as merely discovering an always existing laws. Thus,
whereas the programmer actually determines, through his programs, the displayed form on
the screen the proposed equations, that try to describe a new phenomena, are believed to
have no inﬂuence whatever on them. We show in the following, using various examples, that
there is more than merely this belief. That is, the stage of expressing, explaining, and later
of experimenting, some natural process is not merely a registering of an entirely independent
phenomenon.

Since we are concerned in this work with the stage of writing the program we must take
into account the mentioned fact that the writer is not constrained in any way in his writing
and, therefore, the number of possible outcomes on the computer screen is very large. Thus,
in order to discuss this generalization and the large number of possibilities oﬀered at this
forming stage of writing the program one needs an extra variable that takes account of
this. We note that similar situations exist, especially, in the functional discussion of some
mathematical [3] and physical phenomena [4], where an extra variable is introduced that
takes account of the generalization thus obtained. We use here, for our purpose a similar
technique [5,6] by which an extra variable, denoted by s, has been introduced into the
Langevin equation [7] so that the generalized equation obtained covers also quantum and
ﬁeld phenomena [5,6]. This formalism, termed stochastic quantization (SQ) [5,6], assumes

2

that some stochastic process [8] occurs in the extra dimension of the additional variable and
that the equilibrium physical situations are obtained in the limit of the elimination of it
which is get by equating all the diﬀerent values of this variable to each other and taking
to inﬁnity. This formalism is appropriate for the program writing stage of the simulation
where the resulting outcome on the computer screen depends, as remarked, on the writer’s
wish and so may be thought of as a stochastic process. Note that in the running stage when
only one speciﬁc version is compiled one does not have to use any extra variable in addition
to the spatial-time variables of the computer screen.

We note that the use of stochastic methods in describing physical phenomena has al-
ready been done by various authors that use various diﬀerent names for their methods. For
example, the “quantum-state diﬀusion model” [9], the “quantum jump” model [10], the
“quantum trajectories” approach [11], the “geometrical stochastic state vector reduction”
[12], the “stochastic mechanics” [13], to name a few (see also [14] ).

An important aspect we want to emphasize is the diﬀerences between the case when
the remarked stages of explaining and experimenting some ﬁrstly-met phenomenon are done
by only one observer and the case when a large number of observers participate in these
stages. We show that in the ﬁrst case one may validate and establish through experiment
for himself the mathematical expression he uses in explaining this phenomenon, and the
more large is the number of times of repeating the experiment the more established the
relevant explanation (theory) will be for him. But, as should be obvious, this validation
will not be common to other unrelated observers. We point out in this respect the striking
similarity of these repetitions to the corresponding numerical repetitions, when running any
computer simulation, that ends in obtaining a computer equilibrium state. That is, the main
role of any numerical simulation is iterating a large number of times the basic code which
governs the simulated process, and since a large number of iterations increases the number
of samples a better statistics is obtained as a result of it. When the experiment is done by a
large ensemble of observers the relevant theories will be physically validated and established
without having each one of them repeating his experiment so long as they are related to
each other in the sense that the results of any speciﬁc experiment done by any one of them
is valid also for any other member. That is, although only one, from a large number of
observers, does his speciﬁc experiment, nevertheless, because he is related to all the others
through the similarity of their physical systems the results he obtains hold, as remarked, also
for all the others. We show that the more large is the ensemble of observers that perform
the experiments the more valid will be the underlying theory for all of them even if each
peforms his experiment only once. This point is what diﬀers between establishing a real
new phenomenon and running a program on the computer screen which requires only one
computer.

We discuss ﬁrst the example of the Internet web [15] and focus our attention on the
initial forming stage of its sites, that is, the stage of writing their software source, where,
as remarked, nothing prevent the programmers from writing anything except the rules of
the programming languages they use. We also take account of the ﬁnal stage when from
all the large number of possible site forms allowed initially there remain only those actually
shown on the screen. We discuss the system of a large ensemble of computers connected to
the Internet and also to each other through some sharing software that enables each user to
download any ﬁle from any other member of the ensemble. The important and interesting

3

attribute of such an ensemble is the correlation among its members ∆ijk...(t0, s0, t1, s1, . . .)st
where t and s are the time and the noted extra variable respectively and the suﬃx st denotes
the stationary conﬁguration obtained, as remarked and as required by the SQ theory, in the
limit of eliminating the variable s. Note that since the identity and connectivity of the
sites shown on the screen of any computer are determined by their links, which are accessed
through clicking on the highlighted places of the sites, it is obvious that when the links in,
for example, the sites i and j are diﬀerent then these sites are uncorrelated and the more
large is the number of their common links the more correlated they are. We show that
when they have the remarked sharing property the probability to ﬁnd them with the same
ﬁnite set of ﬁles (sites) is large. We use alternately the terms ﬁle and site on equal footing
although the ﬁrst is, generally, used to mean a more discrete document that belongs to the
user that writes it as compared to the Internet sites that may be accessed by any one who
owns an Internet account. This is so because, as noted, we discuss exclusively the shared
ensemble of users, any one of them has access to the ﬁles of the others, so these ﬁles, in this
respect, have the same status as the Internet websites.

In Section 2 we present the SQ method and relate it to the two-dimensional sites shown
on the screen. In Section 3 we specify the discussion to the sites that discuss the physical
harmonic oscillator. That is, referring to those related to the harmonic oscillator we show
that if the initial sites of most of the ensemble members are harmonic oscillator’s then the
probability to ﬁnd them later with set of ﬁles related to the harmonic oscillator is large
provided that they have the remarked sharing property. The discussion in this section
follows closely that in [16]. In Section 4 we discuss the unphysical process of emitting and
reabsorbing a photon where the total energy is not conserved. We show, using the SQ
formalism and the Fokker-Plank equation [17], that if one takes the classical [6,18] Feynman
diagram [19,20] of this process to all orders then one may obtain the analogous case of
quantum ﬁeld theory in which a measurable energy shift [21,22] is obtained (the Lamb shift).
In Section 5 we discuss the eﬀects of performing measurements by an ensemble of observers
compared to the case of doing it by one observer. We use the path integral method [19,20]
and also the Everett’s relative state formalism [23,24] which is more natural and appropriate
for discussing observers as inherent parts of the physical systems. We obtain quantitative
results that include the number of diﬀerent observers that obtain the same or diﬀerent set of
eigenvalues. In Section 6 we use thermodynamics and entropy considerations [25] to arrive,
using the cylindrical system from [26], at essentially the same results of Sections 2-5.

II. APPLICATION OF THE SQ FORMALISM TO THE INTERNET

The initial stage of writing the program, which depends entirely, as remarked, upon
its writer’s wishes and so may be characterized as a stochastic process, is assumed to be
described, as most stochastic processes, by an n degrees of freedom Langevin equation [7]. It
may represent n diﬀerent computers each connected to its respective user, that may function
as a programmer, and all are connected and shared among them as remarked. This equation
which has been shown [6] to describe a very large number of diﬀerent phenomena, including
those from the quantum regime, is

∂qi(s, t, x)
∂s

= Ki(q(s, t, x)) + ηi(s, t, x),

i = 1, 2, . . . n

(1)

in which the extra variable s has been introduced and ηi denote stochatic processes in this
variable. As remarked, these processes stand for the indeterminacy of the programming acts,
where a large diﬀerent possible versions of the program are allowed at the stage of writing
it for any member i of the ensemble. The variables qi represent the relevant site forms on
the screen which depend upon s and upon the spatial-time axes (x, t), where x denotes the
two dimensional spatial axes of the screen and t is the time (which is eﬀective only for sites
that change kinematically on the screen such as video ﬁles). The Ki are given in the SQ
theory by [5,6]

In order to discuss the “evolution” of any web site in its forming stage of writing
the program that determines its form on the screen we consider the time and s intervals
(t0, t), (s0, s) and divite each of them into N subintervals (t0, t1), (t1, t2), . . . (tN
1, t) and
(s0, s1), (s1, t2), . . . (sN
1, s) respectively. We assume that the Langevin Eq (1) is satisﬁed
for each member of the ensemble at each subinterval with the following Gaussian constraints

Boltzman constant, the temperature in Kelvin units and the relevant friction force. We
note that by using Eq (1) together with the speciﬁc constraints from Eq (3) enables one
[6] to discuss, using the same mathematical tools, a large number of diﬀerent classical and
quantum phenomena. For example, writing α = ¯h one may obtain the quantum regime in
its path integral formalism [6] as will be seen in the following. The middle expression in Eq
(3) may be written as [6]

seen that when the s’s are diﬀerent in the members of the ensemble so that each has its
speciﬁc Si(q(si, t)), Ki(q(si, t)), and ηi(si, t) and so diﬀerent site then the correlation in (6) is
obviously zero. Thus, in order to have a nonzero value for the probability to ﬁnd a large part
of the ensemble having the same ﬁnite set of sites (ﬁles) we have to consider the stationary
conﬁguration where, as remarked, all the s values are equated to each other and eliminated.
For that we take into account that the dependence upon s and t is through q so this ensures
[6] that this dependence is expressed through the s and t diﬀerences. For example, referring
sj), so that for
to the members i and j the correlation between them is ∆ij(ti −
eliminating the s variable from the correlation function one equates all these diﬀerent s’s to
each other to obtain the following stationary equilibrium correlation

where the subscript of st denotes the stationary conﬁguration. In other words, the equilib-
rium physical correlation in our case is obtained when all the diﬀerent s values that give
rise to diﬀerent possible versions of the programs and so to diﬀerent websites are equated
to each other in which case one remains with a ﬁnite set of similar websites that may diﬀer
by only their x (and possibly t) values of the computer screen.

Thus, keeping for all or most members of the ensemble, the same similar versions of
the program by using, as remarked, corresponding similar actions S one ﬁnds with a large
probability these ensemble members, in the later equilibrium stage, with the same ﬁnite
set of similar websites. That is, imposing deliberately the remarked sharing property by
introducing the same similar actions into the corresponding path integrals one ﬁnds this
mentioned large probability as we show explicitly in the following section.

III. THE WEBSITES OF THE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR

As an application of the former discussion we take the harmonic oscillator example and
calculate the correlation of the n member ensemble with respect to the speciﬁc sites that
refer to it. That is, we calculate the conditional probability to ﬁnd the screens of all or most
of the shared computers showing the same set of sites (ﬁles) that contains information about
the harmonic oscillator, assuming that there is a large number of them that may diﬀer from
each other. In other words, supposing that the screens of most or all of them show at the
initial time t0 these harmonic oscillator sites (ﬁles) (denoted collectively as q0) we want to
ﬁnd the probability that they show also at the later time t these or other sites (denoted qN )
that refer only to the harmonic oscillator. We divide, as before, the two intervals (t0, t) and
(s0, s) into N subintervals (t0, t1), (t1, t2), . . . (tN
1, s) and write
the relevant Langevin equation for the subintervals (tk

time tk the harmonic oscillator site qk if at the time tk

only equating all its diﬀerent values to each other. The last expression from Eq (17) is, as
remarked, the probability that if the ensemble members began at the initial time t0 with
the harmonic oscillator site q0 then at the ﬁnal time t they will be found with the harmonic
oscillator site q2N
1. Figure 1 shows the correlation from Eq (17) as a function of t for m = 1
and w0 = 0.4. It begins from the unity value, then steps through a maximum and vanishes
for large t. Figure 2 shows a three-dimensional graph of the general correlation from Eq
(16) that depends upon both t and s and for the same values of m = 1 and w0 = 0.4 as in
Figure 1. Note that for large s the correlation vanishes even at those values of t at which it
attains its maximum in the stationary case of Figure 1.

Note that the stationary conﬁguration from Eq (17) at the time t has been delibrately
arrived at by arranging that the action of each inﬁnitesimal subinterval of each path contains
the harmonic oscillator Langevin expression from Eq (12) (see, for example, Eq (10) that
1, sk)).
includes the Langevin relation from (8) in each pair of subintervals (tk
Thus, since Eq (12) yields the sites qk
i (kk, sk) from Eq (13) and, therefore, the speciﬁc
correlation functions from Eqs (14)-(17) which turn out to be the harmonic oscillator’s once
all the diﬀerent values of s’s are equated to each other we see that the remarked probability
(17) is obtained. Now, taking into account that the classical path integrals, as discussed in
this work, are formulated in the Euclidean formalism [20,28] in which t is imaginary time we
see that the correlation from Eq (17) is almost the same as that of the quantum harmonic
oscillator which is [6,28]

That is, as remarked, one may obtain physical correlations from mathematical expressions
that contain the variable s in the limit of eliminating it as we will see again for another
diﬀerent example in the next section. Moreover, when the remarked substitution of the
harmonic oscillator relation is performed in a dense manner over a very short intervals of t
and s, in which case these substitutions are almost identical, one may obtain the situation
in which all the members of the ensemble have the same sites (ﬁles) and, therefore, the
correlation (17) becomes large. This may be seen from Eq (17) in the limit of large N when
we may write N = t

is satisﬁed then the correlation among the ensemble members is maximal because each of
them have exactly the same ﬁles (sites) so the mentioned probability is unity. Note that
in this case not only the s intervals tends to zero but also the t’s as seen from the former
equations.

IV. THE ENERGY SHIFT EXAMPLE

We see from the former section that substituting into the actions S of the path integrals
[19,20] of a large ensemble of observers the same expression, that represents some interaction
among the various variables of the relevant system, assigns to this expression a physical
signiﬁcance. This obtaining of physical characteristics due to repeating a large number of
times the same experiment, or interaction, reminds us of the quantum Zeno eﬀect [29,30]
in which the large number of repetitions, in a ﬁnite total time, of the same experiment of

9

checking the present state of a quantum system that has been prepared in some deﬁnite state
preserves it in time. When these experiments are not repetitions over the same experiment
but are done consecutively and densely along a deﬁnite preassigned sequence of them that
result in reducing the system to the corresponding deﬁnite sequence of states then this
reduced set, which is one from a large number of possible diﬀerent ones, is physically ﬁxed
[31].

One may argue that since the remarked large number of repetitions “realizes” [31] some
deﬁnite state or a path of such states, from a large number of diﬀerent possible ones, then one
may also “realizes”, through these repetitions, any process even apparently an unphysical
one. We show by the following example of a two state electron which emits a photon and
then reabsorbs it that it may be the case. We subdivide, as before, the intervals (s0, s)
and (t0, t) into a large number of subintervals (s0, s1), (s1, s2), . . . (sN
1, sN ) and (t0, t1),
1, tN ) respectively and formulate the appropriate relation for the described
(t1, t2), . . . , (tN
electron-photon interaction over the representative subintervals (tk
1, sk). The
sought-for relation, because of this kind of interaction, will be an operational one [6], of the
type met in quantum mechanics. That is, we begin from the following Fokker-Plank equation

and its commutation with the operator qi satisfy [6] [πk, qi] = 2αδki, where all one have to
do in order to obtain the quantum regime is to set [6] α = i¯h
2 . From the former relations
one may develop, as has been done in [6], an operator formalism similar to that of quantum
mechanics, especially, the corresponding “Schroedinger”, “Heisenberg” and “interaction”
pictures. Moreover, there has been deﬁned [6] in the stochastic “interaction” picture annihi-
lation and creation operators with commutation relations for which their operations on the
stochastic “bra” and “ket” [6] correspond to their quantum analogs.

Using the former discussion we ﬁnd the probability to ﬁnd at s and t the ensemble at

The probability P I in the equilibrium limit in which, as remarked, the variable s is eliminated
is no other than the equilibrium state [6] (which has also a probability character). Thus, in
the former equations we may assign to the initial s0 and t0 the value of zero and refer to
P I(q0, t0, s0) as the initial state of the discussed system of (electron+photon). As remarked,
the electron is assumed to have two diﬀerent states and that at t1 and s1 it was at the
higher state 2 from which it descends to the lower one 1 through emitting a photon. Then
at t2 and s2 it reabsorbs the photon and returns to state 2 as schematically shown at the
left hand side of Figure 3. The incoming electron and the emitted photon at t1 and s1 may

only those in t as required by the SQ theory [5,6]. The outgoing electron after emission at
t1 and s1 may be represented by the plane wave eiǫ1t1 + eiǫ1s1(1+iδ) where the δ has the same
meaning as before. At the reabsorption stage at t2 and s2 the electron is represented, before

The photon is represented at the reabsorption stage by eiwλt2 +eiwλs2(1+iδ). Also, the emission
itself, denoted by the vertex in Figure 3, may be represented, as in the quantum analog [21],
by gλs and the reabsorption by g+
λs may be
obtained in an equivalent manner to their quantum analogs (see [21]), but these expression
are not required for the discussion here. Thus, since the ﬁnal state at t and s after the
reabsorption of the photon is the same as the initial one before its emission we may write
for the relevant P I at the end of the whole process of emission and reabsorption [21]

as well as the constant terms may be neglected compared to t and s as in the analogous
quantum discussion of the same process [21]. Substituting the resulting expression in Eq
(25) one obtains

of this process, the diagram of the fourth-order term of which is shown on the right hand
side of Figure 3, are taken into account one obtains, analogously to the quantum analog (in
which the variable s is absent), the result

Now, as required by the SQ theory, the physical stationary situations are obtained in the
limit of eliminating the extra variable s which is done by equating all the s values to each
other and taking to inﬁnity, so since we have, in the process of our calculation, equated
the initial s0 to zero we must, likewiswe, equate all the other s values to zero. Thus, the

The last result is the one obtained in quantum ﬁeld theory [21] for the same interaction
of (emission+reabsorption) as the one discussed here. The quantity ∆ǫλ, given by the ﬁrst
of Eqs (30), has the same form also in the quantum version [21,34] where it is termed the
energy shift. This shift results from the unphysical process that does not satisfy even the
basic energy conservation law as seen explicitly in Eqs (25)-(32) where the energy diﬀerence
between the two states of the electron is not equal to the energy of the emitted photon, that
= wλ. This virtual process in the quantum ﬁeld theory leads to an energy shift that
is, ǫ2 −
has been experimentally validated for the case of a real many-state particle in the famous
Lamb shift [21,22,34] of the Hydrogen atom. This shift has been demonstrated also [35] using
nonlinear spectroscopy methods. We must remark that this energy shift, in the quantum
regime, has been shown theoretically and experimentally without, of course, having to use
any extra variabe as we do here. We use this variable in the former section in relation to
the real physical harmonic oscillator example and in this section for the unphysical situation
of emitting and reabsorbing virtual photons in order to show, as remarked, that the large
number of repetitions of the same experiment is an important factor in obtaining physical
results from either process. Thus, in the harmonic oscillator example the large number of
repetitions, eﬀected by substituting the same (harmonic oscillator) expression into the action
S of each path integral of the related ensemble, leads to maximal correlation among them
and to a probability of unity to ﬁnd all of them with the same set of sites (ﬁles) (see Eqs
(16)-(17) and (19)-(20)). These repetitions come into eﬀect here by taking all the orders
of the same Feynman diagram of the (emission + reabsorption) process, which results in
validating the interaction represented in the diagram in the sense that even it is virtual it
yields a measurable energy shift. That is, taking the limit of eliminating the extra variable s,
by which the physical situation is obtained, one remains with the expression for the energy
shift (see Eq (32)) which is obtained only when the same diagram is summed to all orders.
The former results are demonstration of the remarked Aharonov-Vardi [31] idea of per-
forming dense measurement along a speciﬁc Feynman path of states, from a large number
of possible ones, and thus to physically “realize” it [31]. That is, before this realization one
have at most only a tentative mathematical expression that suggests a connection among the
variables of the relevant system, generally in the form of a diﬀerential equation. Integration
of this equation in order to obtain an explicit expression that relates its variables does not
help since the resulting expression involves arbitrary constants of integration (the number
of them depends upon the degree of the diﬀerential equation) that allow a large number of
diﬀerent possible connections among these variables. We must, however, note that although
all values of the constants are allowed in the assumed mathematical relation, nevertheless,
for obtaining physical results one have to do experiments and these can be performed only
for deﬁnite values of the constants. Thus, all one has to do in order to physically realize
his suggested theory is to prepare and perform experiments, with the correct values of the

13

constants, that physically validate it. Moreover, the more repeated are the experiments with
these constants the more physically realized the assumed theory will be.

The described mechanism for “physicalizing” the initial mathematical relation is actually
what we have done with respect to the two examples of the harmonic oscillator and the
energy shift. In both cases we initially have only mathematical relations that depend upon
the variable s (see Eqs (16) and (28)) which plays an analogous role to the remarked constants
of integration. Thus, as for the case of these constants the physical equilibrium conﬁguration
of both examples are obtained when all the values of s are equated to each other in which case
it is eliminated from the involved equations (see Eqs (17) and (31)) as the elimination of the
constants of integrations upon assigning them deﬁnite values. Also, the remarked element
of large number of repetitions was shown in both examples where the s and t intervals were
subdivided into a large number of inﬁnitesimal subintervals in each of which the proposed
connection among the variables of the relevant system was assumed to be eﬀective.

V. THE ENSEMBLE EFFECT

In this section we discuss the eﬀects that result when a large ensemble of related observers
performs experiments. We show that the physical establishment of any new phenomenon
will be shorter and faster the more large the ensemble of observers is, and this is obtained
for the whole of them without the necessity to have each one doing dense measurement
along the speciﬁc Feynman path that represents this phenomenon. The reason is that when
a large number of connected observers perform experiments, each at his time and place,
the overal eﬀect is the same, as will be shown quantitatively, as if each one performs dense
measurement of the kind described.

The collective measurement is performed by ﬁrst preparing N similar systems at N
arbitrarily selected states, from actually the very large number which constitute the speciﬁc
Feynman path which we want to “realize” [31] by densely experimenting along it. These
systems are then delivered to the N observers of the ensemble so that the system i (i =
1, 2, . . . N), prepared at the state φi, is assigned to the observer Oi. Thus, we may write
for the probability amplitude that the ﬁrst observer O1 ﬁnds his system, after doing the
experiment of checking its present state, at the state φ2 of the second observer O2

Φ12 =

The summation is over all the possible secondary paths [36] (as those shown along the middle
primary path of Figure 4) between φ1 and φ2 and the quantities φ1i and φi2 denote [19] the
probability amplitudes to proceed from the state φ1 to φi and from φi to φ2 respectively. In
the same manner one may write for the conditional probability amplitude that the second
observer O2 ﬁnds his system at the state φ3 (of the observer O3), provided that the observer
O1 ﬁnds his system at the state φ2

Figure 4 shows 7 Feynman paths, from actually a large number of paths that all begin at

speciﬁc one along which the described collective dense measurement is performed. Along
this line we have the N (8 in the ﬁgure) initially prepared states φ1, φ2, . . . φN as well as the
secondary Feynman paths that lead from each φi to φi+1 where i = 1, 2, . . . , (N

Thus, we see that performing dense measurement along any Feynman path of states
results in its realization in the sense that the probability to proceed through all of its states
tends to unity. Moreover, as described, the dense measurement is performed through the
joint action of all or most of the ensemble of observers without having to do it separately
by each one of them. Thus, even when each observer performs his experiment only once,
the obtained realized path is now for all them. Figure 5 shows
nevertheless, when N
a schematic representation of the state of the ensemble after the remarked collective dense
measurement. Each separate batch of 4 similar curves denotes a member of the ensemble
that has, as known, a large number of diﬀerent possible Feynman paths (only 4 are shown

→ ∞

15

for clarity). In the middle part of the ﬁgure we have a large number of diﬀerent batches of
paths all mixed among them so it becomes diﬃcult to discern which curve belongs to which
batch. The emphasized path in Figure 5 is the deﬁnite Feynman path along which the de-
scribed collective dense measurement has been done. Note that this path, actually, belongs
to all the diﬀerent batches which means that although each one of the observers performs
his experimental part only once, nevertheless, after completing the described collective mea-
surement each one of those that participates in it has now the same realized Feynman path.
The reason is that although each observer Oi of the ensemble performs his experiment on
his speciﬁcally prepared state φi he may, potentially, do it on any one of the other N
1
states φj
= i. Thus, the result of any experiment, performed by any observer, is valid
for all the others. In other words, the realized Feynman path has been made concrete and
real for all of them in the sense that the probability for each to move along its constituent
states tends to unity as seen from Eq (37).

We note that the last results may be demonstrated in a more natural and appealing
manner by using the relative state theory of Everett [23,24] that has been formulated,
especially, for taking observers into account. We use, in the following, the special notation
and terminology of this theory. Thus, if the initial state was some eigenstate of an operator
A the total initial state of the (system S + observer O) is denoted by ΨS+O = φiΨO[...],
where φi is the initial eigenstate of the system S and ΨO[...] denotes the observer’s state
before the measurement. After the experiment the observer’s state is denoted by ΨO[...αi],
where αi stands for recording of the eigenvalue φi by the observer so that the total ﬁnal state
of the (system + observer) is ΨS+ `O = φiΨO[...αi]. Now, if the initial state of the system is
i aiφi then the total states before and after
not an eigenstate but a superposition of them
the measurement are [23]

j bijφj so that the new initial state (39) before the new
of the eigenfunctions of B φi =

operators. Note that each term in Eq (42) denotes an observer with his speciﬁc sequence
[αi, βj, . . . , λl, ξk] that results from the n experiments. Thus, Eq (42), termed the Everett’s
universal wave function [23,24], yields all the possible results that may be obtained from
measuring the n observables. We, now, count the number of observers that have the same or
similar sequences [αi, βj, . . . , λl, ξk] which record, as remarked, the n measured eigenvalues.
For this we assume that each measurement of any of the n observables may yields K possible
diﬀerent results where the n observables do not have to be all diﬀerent and so some eigen-
values in the sequence [αi, βj, . . . , λl, ξk] may be identical. Thus, denoting by R1, R2, . . . , Rr
the numbers of times the r particular eigenvalues l1, l2, . . . , lr appear respectively in some
speciﬁed sequence [αi, βj, . . . , λl, ξk] we may see from Eq (42) that each possible value of Ri

In Table 1 we show the number of observers that have r predetermined diﬀerent eigenvalues
in their respective n-place sequences for n = 100, ﬁve diﬀerent values of K: 1100, 100, 10, 5, 2,
and even values of r between r = 0 and r = 98. Note that for the large values of K, which
signiﬁes a large number of possible results for any experiment done by any observer, the
sequences most frequently encountered are the ones that have small r as should be and as
we have seen by other methods in the former sections. This is so because a large K signiﬁes
not only a large number of possible results for each experiment but also a large number of
possible initial states which entails a comparatively large number of observers with small r
so that the probability to ﬁnd in the sequences of the ensemble’s members a large number
of the r predetermined eigenvalues is small. For example, for K = 1100 and K = 100 the
number of observers with r = 0, that have not even one of the preassigned eigenvalues, are
10159
1.258257

that have in their sequences 98 places occupied by such eigenvalues. That is, for K = 1100
10145
and K = 100 the number of observers with r = 0 are large by the factors of 1.2268
1041 respectively compared to those with r = 98. On the other hand, for smaller
and 3.9617
K, which signiﬁes a small number of possible diﬀerent results for any observer and so a
corresponding small number of possible initial states , one ﬁnds a large number of observers
that have among their sequences, after the n experiments, a comparatively large number
of the predetermined eigenvalues, that is, a large r. Moreover, as seen from Table 1, the
number of observers increases proportionally to r for small values of K, compared to the
large values of K for which the number of observers decreases as r increases. The results of
Table 1 are corroborated also from Figure 6 which shows a three-dimensional surface of the
relative rate R(K, r) of the increase of observers which is given by

where Nl1,l2,...,lr(K, r) is given by Eq (45) (for K = 70) and the ranges of K and r are

100 respectively. We see from the ﬁgure that the surface,
including the planar form on top of it, is inclined from positive values of R(K, r), for small
K, towards negative values for large K which means that the large numbers of observers are
found at large K and small r as we have found from Table 1. Also, As seen from the ﬁgure,
the rate R(K, r) decreases sharply, for small r, as K increases, whereas this decrease is less
pronounced for intermediate values of r and then it strengthens again for large r but less
than for the small values of it as seen from the ﬁgure. When K = 1, which means that there
is only one result for any experiment and so the initial states are exactly known, we must
have, for each observer, r = n since there is no eigenvalue in any place of any n-sequence
that is diﬀerent from the speciﬁed ones. In this case all the sequences of all the observers
are identical to each other and the probability to ﬁnd in them all the r speciﬁed eigenvalues,
where r = n, is unity. In other words, the more known are the initial states of the observers
the more larger is the probability to ﬁnd among the eigenvalues of their sequences a large
number of the speciﬁed ones. Note that we have found for the harmonic oscillator and
the energy shift examples that if the same initial states are delibrately substituted into the
actions S of all the path integrals that signify the observers then the probability to ﬁnd
them in ﬁnal similar predetermined states is large.

VI. ENTROPY CONSIDERATIONS

We use now entropy considerations [25] to get similar results to those obtained in the
former sections. That is, we show that the eﬀect of a related ensemble of observers is to
“physicalize” the assumed relation between the variables of the system as compared to that
of an unrelated ensemble that have no eﬀect at all in this respect. We assume, in the
following, that we have N thermodynamical systems, of the kind discussed in [26], that is,
a hollow cylinder that contains n particles, not all of the same species, among four pistons
as shown in Figure 7. The pistons A and `A are ﬁxed while B and `B may move along the
cylinder. Also the pistons `A and B do not allow passage of particles through them, whereas
A and `B are permeable so that each permits some kind of particles to move through it

19

where those that are allowed to pass through A are not allowed through `B and vice versa.
The pistons B and `B move in such a way that the distances B `B and A `A are always equal
as seen in Figure 7. These distances are measured using the x axis which is assumed to be
upward along the cylinder. We wish to examine the validity of the assumed connection in
[26] between the two variables x and f , where the latter denotes the property that if any of
the n particles is found in some preassigned interval (x1, x2) then we assign to f the value
of +1, otherwise, if it is found outside this interval then f assumes the value of
1. That
is, the relevant proposed connection between x and f is

−

f (x) =

x
+1 for x2 ≥
1 for x outside (x1, x2)
−

x1

≥

(

(48)

We assume that the piston A is permeable only to the particles inside the interval (x1, x2)
and `B only to those outside it. We denote by w1 the initial probability that any randomly
selected particle is found to be in the interval (x1, x2) and by w2 that it is outside it. At ﬁrst
the pistons B and `B were at the positions of A and `A respectively and all the n particles
were in the one space between. Now, we wish to test the assumed relation from Eq (48) by
performing, reversibly and with no external force, a complete cycle of ﬁrst moving up the
pistons B `B and then retracing them back to their initial places so that the only assumed
relation between the molecules and their positions along the axis x is that from Eq (48).
Thus, we ﬁrst move, without doing work, the pistons B and `B so that, as remarked, the
volume enclosed between them equals that between A `A and since A is permeable to the
particles in the interval (x1, x2) and `B to the rest the result is that we obtain two separate
equal volumes, each of which equals to the initial one, the upper one B `B contains only the
particles from the predetermined interval (x1, x2) and the lower A `A only the others. We
want now to retrace our former steps and move, again without doing work, the pistons B
and `B to the places of A and `A so as to have, as before, the same initial volume and thus
to complete one cycle. We must take into account, however, that during the upward motion
some particles that were inside (outside) the interval (x1, x2) may come out of (into) it due
to thermal or other kind of ﬂuctuation so that these particles change from the kind that
may pass through the piston A ( `B) into the kind that is not allowed to do that. Thus, the
last step of retracing the pistons B, `B into their former initial positions at the pistons A, `A
respectively can not be performed without doing work since the molecules that have come
out of (into) the interval (x1, x2) are not permitted now to pass through A ( `B). That is, the
former process of expanding the volume is not reversible as described because we have to
exert force on these molecules to move them back into (out of) the interval (x1, x2) so that
they can pass through A ( `B). Thus, the relation (48) is not valid any more since it does not
take into account the external force just described. We may express this in a quantitative
manner by noting that there is now [26] a decrease of entropy per molecule after the ﬁrst
step of moving up the pistons which may be calculated by taking account of the fact that
now the probabilities, to ﬁnd any randomly selected molecule out of (in) the preassigned
interval (x1, x2), are diﬀerent from the initial values w2 and w1 before moving up the pistons.
Thus, suppose that during the ﬁrst stage of expanding the initial volume of the cylinder no
molecules, from the total number n, have come out of the remarked interval and ni from
outside have entered so that the probability to ﬁnd now any randomly selected molecule out
of it is (w2 + (no

If no = ni, the entropy diﬀerence from Eqs (52) is obviously zero which results in the
validation of the relation (48) after returning the pistons back to their initial places as
= ni the expression (48) can not be validated by retracing, without
remarked. When no 6
doing work, the volume back to its initial value since now the molecules that come out of
the interval (x1, x2) and those that have entered it prevent this reversible motion which is
necessary for its validation. Thus, a new expression, instead of the invalid one from Eq
(48), that takes account of these molecules must be adopted as in [26]. But before writing
this expression we remark that the probability w1 must be proportional to the length of the
x1, so that a small or large value for one indicates a corresponding
remarked interval x2 −
value for the other. Thus, we may deﬁne a probability distribution for w1 in terms of
the variable x and assume a normal distribution [37] so that we may write for the density
function of w1(x), denoted as fw1(x),

Note that in order to have no negative expression under the ln sign, especially for the
following numerical simulations, we take the absolute values of these expressions which does
not change the real calculated results. The right hand side of Eq (55), which yields the
entropy decrease per molecule, must be multiplied by the number n of molecules in the
cylinder in order to obtain the total decrease of entropy after moving up the pistons. Figure

The remarked problem of moving back the pistons, without doing work, to their original
volume has been solved in [26] by taking into account Eq (48) which assign to f (x) the value
of +1 when the relevant molecule was in the interval (x1, x2) and
1 otherwise. That is, after
the ﬁrst step of doubling the initial volume the cylinder includes now, except the molecules
that remain inside (outside) the noted interval and characterized by f (x) = 1 (f (x) =
1),
also those that were in (outside) it and were denoted by these values. All these molecules
that were in (out of) the interval (x1, x2) continue, for the short time interval between
moving the pistons up and down, to be denoted by f (x) = 1 (f (x) =
1). Thus, as noted
in [26], for the last step of retracing to the original volume, without doing work, one has
only to replace the pistons A by A∗ that is permeable not with respect to the molecules in
the interval (x1, x2) but to those that their f (x) is +1. Correspondingly, the piston `B is

(

(56)

In such a way one is able to perform a complete cycle of ﬁrst expanding the volume with the
original permeable pistons A and `B and then retrace this step reversibly with the pistons
A∗ and `B∗ instead of A and `B as remarked. Thus, all the possible motions of the molecules,
including their coming out of or into the given interval (x1, x2) are accounted for by Eq (56)
which results in its validation as remarked (see the discussion after Eq (48)).

The only problem left is that in which the act of expanding the volume in the ﬁrst
step with the original pistons A and `B results in a decrease of the entropy per molecule
by the amount calculated in Eq (55). This is solved in [26] by assuming, in order not to
violate the thermodynamical second law, that the experiment of lifting the pistons must be
accompanied by a corresponding increase of the entropy. But we have to take into account
that this production of entropy is required only for the molecules that step out of (into) the
noted interval so that the decrease of entropy per molecule from Eq (55) is not zero and
thus one have to assume a corresponding compensating increase of it. That is, considering
the molecules that remain in (out of) this interval we conclude that there is no entropy
decrease during the moving-up stage and, therefore as remarked, no compensating increase
of it. Thus, it is not the mere performance of the experiment that involves this production
of entropy but the use of the pistons A and `B in the moving-up stage of the motion which
results not only in the failure of Eq (48) due to the decrease of entropy but also to the
necessity of assuming a corresponding increase of it even after adopting the more general
relation from Eq (56). Thus, all one have to do is to use the pistons A∗ and `B∗ also in
the moving-up stage of the motion. That is, using Eq (56) and deﬁning w1 (w2) as the
probability to ﬁnd any randomly selected molecule either in (outside) the interval (x1, x2)
or as one that was in (out of) it we certainly ﬁnd for each molecule the same value of f (x)
during the whole complete cycle so that no entropy has been decreased and, therefore, no
production of it is required for compensation. Thus, the entropy change per molecule during
the complete cycle is zero.

Now, if we take into account the possible Feynman paths [19] through which the system
may evolute during the remarked complete cycle then such paths may be characterized also
by those that conform to Eq (48) or to (56). That is, the Feynman paths that may result
in a deacrease of the entropy are those in accord with (48) and those that do not change its
value are in accord with (56). Thus, using (56) is the same as passing along the speciﬁc path
that preserve the entropy and rejecting those that change it (that conform to (48)). All one
have to do is to “realize” the correct path, in the sense of [31], which is done by repeating a
large number of times the whole process of ﬁrst moving-up the pistons with the original A
and `B and then of returning to the initial volume with either the same pistons if no decrease
of entropy occurs or with the replaced A∗ and `B∗ if such a decrease is registered. Thus, one
must have, as shown in the former sections, a large number of observers each moving up and
down his respective pistons in the described manner. We calculate the correlation among
the N separate systems by assuming that all begin with the original pistons A, `A, B and `B
and ﬁnding the number of them that after completing one cycle are found with the pistons

expanding the initial volumes of the N cylinders we ﬁnd, for some of them, that no molecule
from the interval (x1, x2) has come out of it and no one from outside has entered then they
end, after returning the volume to its initial state, with the same pistons they begin with
and in such a case the expression (48) is obviously valid for them. But suppose that for the

that the sum of all these +1 constitutes from the total Nc experiments.
It is shown, as
remarked, that as N grows this fraction increases and with it the probability that most of
them obtain negative entropy diﬀerences in which case they end, according to the rules of
the experiment (see the discussion after Eq (56)), with the replaced pistons A∗ and `B∗ in
place of the original ones A and `B so that the relation (56) is established for most of them.
Figure 9 shows the remarked fraction fNc(N) for Nc = 1000 as a function of the N observers
and we see that fNc(N) grows as N increases. That is, the presence of a large number of

We note that the same results may be obtained by using other methods and terminology.
Thus, it is shown in [38] that the “localization” (in the sense of smaller dispersion) for the
φ > is greater the more small is the entropy which results when the rate of “eﬀective
state
interaction with the environment” [38] increases. Localization is another phrase for what we
call here “realizing or preserving a speciﬁc state” and the interaction with the environment
is equivalent to performing experiment [39–41], so that as the rate of performing experiment
grows the more realized and localized is the state one begins with or the path of states along
which one proceeds.

We see, therefore, that the classical thermodynamic system discussed here obeys also
the same evolution we have encountered in the former sections regarding the development
of newly met phenomena. That is, the establishment of the assumed physical connection
from Eq (56) between the variables f and x proceeds through the mentioned steps of ﬁrst
trying to propose an appropriate theory that connects between f and x. It is ﬁrst expressed
in the form (48) but it soon becomes clear, by trying to validate it through experiments,
that there is a gap between it and the experimental results with regard to the molecules
that come out of (into) the preassigned interval (x1, x2). Thus, in order to conform to the

25

experimental ﬁndings one have to replace the weak theory of (48) by the new expression from
Eq (56) which takes into account these molecules. The new theory entails a corresponding
change in the experimental set-up that is supposed to validate it. That is, the replacement
of the pistons A and `B by A∗ and `B∗ in the second stage of reversing back, without doing
work, to the former volume. The important step that assign to the relation (56) a physical
aspect is, as remarked in the former section, when a large number of observers perform
the relevant experiments with their cylinders and obtain similar results. Finally we realize
that the moving-up with the original pistons, which is the sole source of the decrease and
the assumed production of entropy, is not needed any more and we may account for all
the possible changes the molecules may undergo during the moving-up motion by using Eq
(56) together with experimenting with the pistons A∗, `A, B, `B∗ during the whole complete
cycle. The result is the ultimate validation of Eq (56) without any decrease of entropy, and,
therefore, no assumed commpensating production of it.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

We show, using examples that range from ﬁeld events through Internet webmastering to
classical thermodynamics, that the physical processes must pass through a time in which
they become ﬁxed and established. At the beginning of this time one encounters a new
phenomenon or some unstable process that he wish to further explore using experiments that
are prepared to reconstruct this phenomenon under various conditions. We show that the
more large the number of repetitions of the relevant experiments the more valid and physical
the new process will be assuming that most of these experiments result in establishing it. The
corresponding initial theory, before it becomes physically established through the remarked
is shown to have a possible dependence upon an extra variable [5,6] that
experiments,
takes account of the large possible evolutions, allowed at this initial time, for the relevant
system. The theory found suitable for discussing these initial possibilities is the stochatic
quantization theory of Parisi-Wu [5] where an extra variable is introduced that takes account
of an assumed stochastic process (in this variable), that allows, as all stochastic processes do,
a large diﬀerent possible behaviours of the system. The equilibrium conﬁguration is obtained
[5,6] when this variable is eliminated through equating all its diﬀerent values to each other
and taking to inﬁnity. This equating of all the possible s values to each other introduces
an element of repetitions of the same process through which the system is stabilized and
brought to its physical equilibrium conﬁguration.

These results were validated also by comparing the mechanism just described to the
known procedure of numerical simulations in which one ﬁnds the same mentioned steps re-
lated to the establishment of physical processes. For example, the initial stage of writing
the program that depends entirely upon the programmer may be described, as shown, by a
Langevin equation. Also, the running of the ﬁnal version of the program on the computer
screen is done through a large number of iterations of its code which is the main characteris-
tic of numerical simulations. A large number of these iterations entails a corresponding large
number of samples which results in a better statistics. As an example for these computer
simulations we take the Internet websites and especially those that refer to the harmonic
oscillator and to the energy shift. The mentioned initial time through which the new phe-
nomena are established have also been discerned in the classical thermodynamical cylinder

26

system.

The same eﬀect of physically establishing the new phenomena and their theories is ob-
tained, more eﬃciently and fastly, through a collective experiment performed by a large
number of related observers. It results, as remarked, in realizing and making concrete the
relevant Feynman path of states for all the observers as if each has performed dense mea-
surement along it. This is because, although each one may do his speciﬁc experiment only
once, nevertheless, since all the observers have similar systems the speciﬁc results obtained
by any one are valid for all the others as if they do the same experiment. We have also
shown that when the observers are not related to each other then this physical realization
of the speciﬁc evolution will not be obtained.

An equivalent analog has been discussed in [16] with regard to the Internet websites where
it has been shown, using the cluster formalism of Ursell [42] and Mayer [43], that a large
ensemble of connected shared computers (users) may aquire a very large additional amount
of connectivity [44] among them by adding only a small amount of connecting website links.
The process of repetitions described are reminiscent of the Zeno eﬀect [29,31] by which
an equilibrium physical conﬁguration is obtained as a consequence of these repetitions. This
is eﬀective not only for repeating the same experiment with the same system a large number
of times in a ﬁnite time but also when a large number of observers, all conﬁned in a ﬁnite
region of space, perform similar experiments as shown by the various examples discussed
here and in [45]. This inﬂuence of the ensemble has been shown to be eﬀective also for
classical systems (see also [46]). We remark that the appearance of physical phenomena
due to only repeating the same experiment a large number of times or performing densely a
large number of slightly diﬀerent measurements has been experimentally demonstrated [30]
using various methods and techniques.

We note that this Zeno eﬀect by which one Feynman path of states, from a large number
of possible ones, is “realized” whereas the probability for the other paths tends to zero satis-
ﬁes the consistency conditions of the histories formalism of Gell-Mann-Hartle and Griﬃths
[47–49]. That is, only one evolution is eﬀected in the last run and not a superposition of
them.

photon in the time interval (t0, t) where the energy is not conserved. The electron is represented
in the ﬁgure by the directed arrow and the photon by the wavy line. The right hand side of the
ﬁgure shows the same virtual process repeated four times, in a perturbative manner, over the same
time interval.

FIG. 4. seven Feynman paths of states that all begin at the state φ1 and end at φ8 are shown in
the ﬁgure. The middle path is the one along which the collective dense measurement is performed
i = 1, 2, . . . N . The N separate systems of these observers have
by the ensemble members Oi
been initially prepared in the states φi
i = 1, 2, . . . N . Only eight states are shown in the ﬁgure
for clarity. Note the secondary Feynman paths between neighbouring states in the middle path.

FIG. 5. A schematic representation of the physical situation after performing the collective
dense measurement shown in Figure 4. Note that although no member of the ensemble has done
dense measurement by himself, nevertheless, the joint action of all or most of the observers has
resulted in “realizing” the speciﬁc Feynman path from Figure 4 for all the participating observers.
This relized path is shown emphasized in the ﬁgure.

FIG. 6. The ﬁgure shows a three-dimensional surface of the relative rate of the number of
observers as function of the number of possible results K for each experiment and the number r
of places occupied by preassigned eigenvalues (see text). The ranges of K and r are 2
250
100 respectively. Note the large jump towards zero for large K when r increases from

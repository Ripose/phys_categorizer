Abstract

A new method for approximating spatiotemporal noise covariance for use in MEG/EEG source
analysis is proposed. Our proposed approach extends a parameterized one pair approximation con-
sisting of a Kronecker product of a temporal covariance and a spatial covariance [1] into 1) an
unparameterized one pair approximation and then 2) into a multi-pair approximation. These models
are motivated by the need to better describe correlated background and make estimation of these
models more eﬃcient. The eﬀects of these diﬀerent noise covariance models are compared using a
multi-dipole inverse algorithm and simulated data consisting of empirical MEG background data as
noise and simulated dipole sources.

I. Introduction

The magnetoencephalogram (MEG)/ electroencephalogram (EEG) source localization problem is
to infer active brain regions from measurements outside of the human head. Often, for example in
evoked response experiments, the data from individual stimulus trials are averaged, time-locked to
the stimulus presentation. This averaged post-stimulus data (signal) is compared with the statistical
properties of the averaged data far from the stimulus ( representing background ) and this diﬀerence
is used to infer the location and time-courses of neural activity that were, at least on average,
generated in response to the given stimulus. Because these inferences are based on diﬀerences
between signal and background, it is important to characterize the background as accurately as
possible. This is especially important in spatiotemporal analysis since background is correlated
both in space and time.

The log likelihood function is a common mathematical expression quantifying the likelihood of a
given model ( current distribution ) matching the data. For Gaussian zero-mean noise background
spatiotemporal data log likelihood is given by:

Here bkt are the measurements (the data being analyzed) at sensor k and time t, Lk(x) is the lead
ﬁeld at point x for the sensor k, j(x, t) is the current distribution function used in the forward model
and COV is averaged background (assumed to be Gaussian) covariance, which describes second
order statistical properties of MEG/EEG background in time and space. There are a number of
diﬀerent inverse algorithms in use [2–7] but most use the likelihood formulation in some way. In all
cases, accurate covariance is required to solve source localization problem more accurately. However,

the covariance has been commonly taken to be diagonal, even though there is ample evidence that
the background averaged data is correlated within both space and time [8–10]. This may aﬀect the
results of inverse calculations, such as biasing source location [11], as is demonstrated here.

In principle, if a normal distribution is assumed, the full covariance matrix of the averaged data
can be estimated in the following way. MEG/EEG is measured in M trials, on L sensors and in C
time samples. Let Em be the L by C single trial noise matrix at trial m. Conventionally, the full
averaged noise covariance matrix of dimension N = LC is estimated by

COV =

M(M − 1)

¯E =

(vec(Em) − vec( ¯E))(vec(Em) − vec( ¯E))T ,

(3)

where vec(E) is all the columns of E stacked in a vector.

There are a number of reasons why this estimate of the full covariance is diﬃcult to use and
why an adequate approximation is needed. First, suﬃcient experimental data is rarely available
to adequately estimate the large number of parameters present in the full covariance matrix for
modern multi-sensor setups. For example, for 35 time samples and 121 channels and considering
the fact that covariance matrix is symmetric, 8, 969, 730 parameters should be determined. Second,
since spatiotemporal noise covariance matrix in this form is extremely large, a tremendous amount
of memory is required for its storage. Third, this full covariance is almost impossible to handle in
the likelihood formulation, since computation time of calculating the inverse still renders the task
infeasible in most interesting cases. A naive algorithm for matrix inversion takes O(N 3) time and
though there are some improvements over this result for large matrices [12, 13], it is still hard with
any interesting N. Here, N is the dimensionality of the matrix. Due to all these diﬃculties with
the estimate of the full spatiotemporal covariance, some approximation needs to be introduced.

II. Models

In this section we describe several models approximating the full spatiotemporal noise covariance.
Among them are two existing models and three models we introduce in this paper. Existing models
include the widely used diagonal approximation and a Kronecker product approximation introduced
by Huizenga et.al [1]. We introduce two additional models based on a single Kronecker product
approximation. They are: an unparameterized maximum likelihood approximation and one pair
model calculated from the data. And most important, we present a new multi-pair model based on a
series of Kronecker products. Three of these ﬁve models are compared later in the paper. They are:
diagonal approximation, one pair model calculated from the data and multi-pair approximation.

A. Diagonal approximation

It is common when solving the inverse problem to model covariance as a diagonal or even just as
an identity. In this case the full spatiotemporal covariance is COV ∝ T⊗S, where T is the temporal
covariance which is taken to be identity and S is the diagonal spatial covariance with elements of
the main diagonal being sensor variances. This model is very simple and yet still generates noise
with variance levels consistent with those of noise generated by more complex models described
below.

B. Kronecker product approximation

B.1 An existing model

As an improvement over the widely used, generic diagonal approximation, Huizenga et al. pro-
posed a Kronecker product of a C by C temporal covariance matrix T and a L by L spatial
covariance matrix S [1, 14], where C is the number of time samples and L is the number of sensors:

COV ≈ T ⊗ S = 

...

...

TC1S TC2S · · · TCCS









To reduce the number of free parameters in the model both spatial and temporal covariances were
parameterized. It was assumed that spatial covariance can be modeled as an exponential function
of the distance between sensors [1]:

ˆsll′ = ˆσl ˆσl′exp(−(dll′/ ˆα) ˆβ)

where dll′ is the distance between sensors l and l′, ˆσl and ˆσl′ are the standard deviations of corre-
sponding sensors, and ˆα and ˆβ are free parameters. In this model, covariance between sample t and
t′ was denoted as a scalar Ttt′ and it was assumed that temporal covariances are only dependent on
the lag t − t′ between samples. It follows that temporal covariance could be expressed as Toeplitz
matrix.

Huizenga et al. also assumed that the full covariance matrix has been estimated. They suggested

two ways to determine the parameters to their Kronecker model. First, by minimizing:

tr{

F − ˆT ⊗ ˆS
i

(cid:16)h

W−

1

}

(cid:17)

where F is the full spatiotemporal covariance (2) and ˆT and ˆS are estimates of T and S, respectively.
Note that W is the weighting matrix and setting it to diﬀerent values gives diﬀerent noise parameter
estimates. For example setting it to I yields Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimate. Second, by
minimizing [1, 15]:

ψ( ˆT, ˆS) = ln | ˆT ⊗ ˆS| + tr{

F} = L ln | ˆT| + C ln |ˆS| + tr

ˆT−

1 ⊗ ˆS−

which gives Maximum Likelihood (ML) covariance estimate. Inversion of this model is easily cal-
culated by using the following identity:

However, the Huizenga model was found unworkable for our dataset, described below. The most
important diﬃculty we encountered working with this model was numerical instability, which lead
to the impossibility of inverting the spatial and temporal covariances because they were numerically
almost singular. This was likely due to their parameterization of spatial covariance (5): ˆα in the
denominator of a fraction which is an argument to exponential function was contributing to forming
a numerically unstable matrix. These diﬃculties lead us to introduce other models based on this
one so it would be possible to use it for comparison purposes.

B.2 Unparameterized maximum likelihood model

In order to have a one Kronecker product model for subsequent comparisons that would work
in our case we introduce another model. In this model, both spatial and temporal covariances are
unparameterized leading to several beneﬁts. Importantly it is not prone to numerical instability
- solutions in our analysis had numerically tractable inverses. Also, the increased number of free
parameters allows the proposed model to capture more information about the noise than Huizenga’s
(see section B.1). Finally, this model is markedly faster in the convergence of iterative ﬁtting of the
model to the full spatiotemporal covariance because an analytical calculation of partial derivatives of
(7) is possible ( see appendix A). Having obtained partial derivatives of ψ from (7), namely ∂ψ( ˆT,ˆS)
∂ ˆT−1
and ∂ψ( ˆT,ˆS)
, it is easy to devise an iterative algorithm for minimizing ψ( ˆT, ˆS). This derivative
∂ ˆS−1
basically yields the same results as [14].

Note that this estimate can give sensor variances inconsistent with those estimated from the
data and given by other models (see for example ﬁgure 1). This is expected as we are obtaining

Maximum Likelihood estimates without constraining our model to keep correct variances. That is,
maximizing the likelihood does not necessarily mean keeping sensor variances consistent with those
that are correct. Below we explain our solution to this issue.

B.3 One pair model calculated from the data

To overcome this feature, and observing that the model T ⊗ S assumes independence between

space and time, we can estimate T and S directly from the data by:

ˆT =

ˆS =

where Em is a L × C single trial noise data with L number of sensors and C number of time points,
M is number of trials. The above is true with the assumption that each sensor measurement, at
any time point, at any epoch, is an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random vector;
and each time vector for any sensor at any epoch is also an i.i.d. random vector. Correctness of this
estimation for the model can be demonstrated if we assume that the noise was indeed generated

from this model. For more details of this argument see appendix B. Inherently, this model yields
the same sensor variances as the full covariance.

We use this modiﬁed version of the one pair Huizenga model for comparisons with the diagonal

model and our multi-pair model in the rest of the paper.

C. Multi-pair approximation

In an attempt to capture more properties of the full covariance while still allowing for inversion we
propose an alternative estimation of noise covariance as a series of Kronecker products of temporal
covariance matrices Tl and orthogonal spatial covariance matrices Sl expressed as:

L

COV ≈

Tl ⊗ Sl.

Diagonal entries of this matrix are time-lagged autocovariances, and oﬀ-diagonal entries (l, l′) are
cross covariances between (time t, component l) and (time t′, component l′). Assuming cross

Note that the above assumption of small cross covariances lets us construct a model which is
easily invertible due to the orthogonality of spatial components. In cases where this assumption
does not hold, the model might not perform optimally.

Our Multi-pair Model is

where Sl are constructed from the orthogonal singular vectors of the SVD of the data and Tl
are constructed from the data having been rotated into the orthogonal space formed by spatial
components. This model has less free parameters than the full spatiotemporal covariance estimate
(2) and has more expressive power than the one Kronecker product model (4) described in [1].
A very important feature that favorably distinguishes this model is that it does not need the full
spatiotemporal covariance and can be estimated directly from the data. Also, inversion is still
computationally manageable and only a constant time slower than inversion of (4).

Proposition 1: The inversion of

COV can be expressed by

Empirical MEG data used for comparing these noise covariance models were acquired in the

following experiment:

Median nerve stimulation at the motor twitch threshold was applied using a block design of
30s on, 30s oﬀ for a total of 10 blocks for each of 8 runs. The stimulus alternated across runs,
with four runs total of left side stimulation and four runs total of right side stimulation. The ISI
(interstimulus interval) was randomized from between 0.25 and 0.75s (Fig. 2). Such setup provides
for easier collection of brain noise since there is no stim for long periods. This feature might be
useful in other noise studies. Data were collected on 4D Neuroimaging Neuromag-122 whole-head
gradiometer system with 122 channels [16]. The experiment used a male subject, age 38, sampling
rate was set to 1000Hz.

A median ﬁlter was chosen because high-pass ﬁltering was introducing substantial distortions to
the signal in the averaged data. These distortions expressed themselves more strongly as the cutoﬀ
frequency values increased. In ﬁgure 3, comparisons are shown between changes introduced by a
high-pass ﬁlter for 10Hz (3(b)) and the much smaller changes that appeared after median ﬁltering

chosen since at this cutoﬀ, distortions are clearly seen. In this paper, a 1Hz cutoﬀ frequency was
used. Distortions introduced by a high-pass ﬁlter are not as evident there but should still be bigger
than those introduced by subtracting the median ﬁltered signal from the original signal for the high
pass eﬀect. This justiﬁes the use of median ﬁltering.

The 60Hz noise and harmonics were handled by removing peaks in the spectrum and then inter-

polating between adjacent spectrum points.

A. Comparing model covariances to full covariance

We compare three models described in the previous section in terms of their ability to approximate
the full spatiotemporal covariance and also in terms of the performance of an inverse algorithm
employing those models. These models are: diagonal approximation, one pair model calculated
from the data and the multi-pair model. We have used 121 channel data with 35 time points (35ms
with the used sampling frequency). This time interval is the maximal interval at which we still had
enough data samples available for reliable estimation of the full spatiotemporal covariance matrix.
Estimation of the full spatiotemporal covariance matrix is needed since it is used for comparisons.
Channel 51 was removed due to the presence of a large number of artifacts. Covariance models were
calculated using the formulation in the previous section. All covariances were consistent with each
other in that they yielded the same sensor variances. The only diﬀerence was in the correlation

structure.

In ﬁgure 4, scatterplots of spatiotemporal covariance approximation models with the full co-
variance are plotted. These plots were constructed by plotting points on a graph such that the
x-coordinate of a point is the value of an element of the full spatiotemporal covariance and the
y-coordinate is the value of the corresponding element in the model covariance. Distribution was
scaled to the same range of values. Such a construction provides information about structural cor-
respondence of the models with the full covariance. The case of ideal coincidence should give a
ﬁgure with all points located along a line that goes through the origin and forms a 45◦ angle with
the x-axis. In order to have a reference each ﬁgure is plotted over a ﬁgure that has a point for each
element of the full spatiotemporal covariance with x and y coordinates equal to each other and equal
to the value of this element. Even though it is clear that all points of this ﬁgure will be located on
a 45◦ line, this still gives additional information about which values are present in the covariance.
In the case when the approximation is very close to the full covariance, the scatterplot should be
very close to this reference plot. Note that the scatterplot of the diagonal approximation and the
full spatiotemporal covariance (shown in 4(a)) is very diﬀerent from the other two. Many points
of this plot are on the x-axis. This is easily explained by an observation that non-zero oﬀ-diagonal
elements of the full spatiotemporal covariance correspond to zero oﬀ-diagonal elements of the di-
agonal approximation. This means that for each oﬀ-diagonal element of the full spatiotemporal
covariance we place a point with the corresponding x-coordinate and the zero y-coordinate. These
ﬁgures suggest that our proposed multi-pair spatiotemporal covariance model should be better than
the other two models in approximating the structure of the full spatiotemporal covariance .

B. Comparing noise models in an inverse algorithm

In order to compare performance of the models in an inverse algorithm, we used simulated data
constructed with three dipoles acting in the region of 35ms using the same physical setup as in the
empirical experiment. Locations are given on a sphere ﬁtted to the skull with the z axis pointing
up, the y axis pointing left and the x axis pointing forward. Dipole parameters are presented in
Table I.

To these simulated dipoles, we added noise extracted from prestimulus regions of type 1 stimulus

As stated earlier, there are many inverse algorithms that use the likelihood function. Rather
than pick one such algorithm, we chose to summarize the eﬀects each background model had on
the function itself by numerically sampling the likelihood function using a dipole source model. To
obtain this sampling we used a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) approach [17]. The code used
for sampling was developed in our group for Bayesian inference dipole analysis [4, 18]. The number
of dipoles was ﬁxed at three. The free parameters for each dipole were the location, orientation
and time course. The sampled dipole locations may be histogrammed to show the probability of
reconstructed dipole locations in relation to the true dipoles. 1000 samples were generated for
each covariance model and were used to summarize the likelihood in each case. Histograms of
likelihoods of the distances between the true locations of dipoles and those obtained using diﬀerent
covariance models are in ﬁgure 6. They were constructed by histogramming the projection of the
sampled dipole locations onto the line connecting the true dipole location and the mean location
of the sampled dipoles. The origin of this line was set to the location of the true dipole. Only the
results of the multi-pair covariance are consistent with the true locations for all three dipoles. Both
the one pair and diagonal covariance models yielded inconsistent results, with that of the diagonal
covariance being the most inconsistent.

In addition the width of the likelihood in the multi-pair case is wider than in the one pair or
diagonal cases. We believe this is due to more positive correlation in the multi-pair case, which
reduces the number of independent samples in the data and results in a wider distribution (eg. [19, p.
24]). To obtain additional support for this explanation we modeled the variances of the log likelihood
function for each of these models. We calculate variance of the log likelihood (deﬁned in (1)) around
the true dipole location as:

Now, by changing Σ to the appropriate covariance model and using the noise data from our ex-
perimental set we obtain the variances of the log likelihood for each model, which are in Table II.

These results are consistent with our observation and support the argument that it is the cor-
relation structure of each noise model that aﬀects the width of the reconstructed dipole location
distribution.

In this section, we have demonstrated that the multi-pair model approximates the full spatiotem-
poral covariance structure better than the other two models used for comparison. This model also
shows better results for the purpose of localization.

IV. Conclusions

As it was demonstrated, the proposed multi-pair model captures more information about the
structure of the noise in the data (ﬁgure 4) which can be useful in the analysis of MEG/EEG data.
This approximation has several useful features which distinguish it from others. Most important is
its ability to capture more information about noise due to increased degrees of freedom. Further,
the model is still quite straightforward to estimate. Another important feature is that it does
not need the full covariance for estimation; hence, it can be tractable for the smaller amounts of
data that are usually available in practice. At the same time, all the good properties of previous
approximations are preserved: the inversion is still easy to calculate, space requirements are not
high and the number of free parameters is much smaller than in the full covariance.

Appendices

A gradient method should be faster than others, thus expression (7) needs to be diﬀerentiated.
This can be done analytically, making the solution much easier. Diﬀerentiation was performed with
respect to inverses of parameter matrices (T and S), since that was found to give better convergence
results than diﬀerentiating with respect to non-inverted parameter matrices.

Having analytical derivatives, solutions can be obtained quickly with iterative algorithms. In this

where k is the iteration number, Tk:ij and Sk:ij are elements of the inverted matrices T and S,
respectively. Initial conditions for both matrices in our analysis were set to identity, which gave
fast convergence.

B. Validating estimation of one pair model

In order to show that the method we use for the estimation of the one Kronecker product model

is valid, we start from an assumption that the noise was generated by such a model:

where ~η is a column vector of white Gaussian noise of length LC and ~n is the resulting vector of
correlated Gaussian noise. This can be represented in another form if we generate Gaussian noise
in the form of an L × C matrix, where L is the number of sensors and C - number of time points:

with n being the resultant L×C correlated Gaussian noise sample. In section B spatial and temporal
covariances were estimated as

With normalization we get

˜T ⊗ ˜S
Trace( ˜T ⊗ ˜S)

= T ⊗ S.

Thus, for the noise that has spatiotemporal covariance structure described by a Kronecker product
both spatial and temporal covariances could be recovered by the procedure described in (10) up to
a multiplicative constant. The constant is not important since we are able to demonstrate validity
of the approach without calculating it.

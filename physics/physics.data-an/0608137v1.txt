In this paper we investigate the dependence structure for PARMA mod-
els (i.e. ARMA models with periodic coeﬃcients) with symmetric α−stable
innovations. In this case the covariance function is not deﬁned and therefore
other measures of dependence have to be used. After obtaining the form
of the bounded solution of the PARMA system with symmetric α-stable
innovations, we study the codiﬀerence and the covariation – the most pop-
ular measures of dependence deﬁned for symmetric stable time series. We
show that both considered measures are periodic. Moreover we determine
the cases when the codiﬀerence and the covariation are asymptotically pro-
portional with the coeﬃcient of proportionality equal to α.

1. Introduction

Conventional time series analysis is heavily dependent on the assumption
of stationarity. But this assumption is unsatisfactory for modelling many
real-life phenomena that exhibit seasonal behaviour. Seasonal variations in
the mean of time series data can be easily removed by a variety of methods,
but when the variance varies with the season, the use of periodic time se-
ries models is suggested. In order to model periodicity in autocorrelations,
a class of Periodic Autoregressive Moving Average (PARMA) models was
introduced. The PARMA(p, q) system is given by:

Xn −

bj(n)Xn−j =

ai(n)ξn−i,

(1)

p

Xj=1

q−1

Xi=0
j=1 and {ai(n)}q−1

where n ∈ Z and the coeﬃcients {bj(n)}p
i=0 are nonzero
sequences periodic in n with the same period T while the innovations {ξn}

(1)

2

are independent Gaussian random variables. For such PARMA models, the
covariance function is a tool for describing the dependence structure of the
time series and we can recall that the sequence given by (1) is periodi-
cally correlated, more precisely the covariance function Cov(Xn, Xn+k) is
T −periodic in n for every k (see [1, 2, 3]). As the coeﬃcients in (1) are pe-
riodic, it is obvious that the class of PARMA models is an extension of the
class of commonly used ARMA models. Due to their interesting properties,
PARMA systems have received much attention in the literature and turned
out to be an alternative to the conventional stationary time series as they
allow for modelling many phenomena in various areas, e.g., in hydrology
([4]), meteorology ([5]), economics ([6, 7]) and electrical engineering ([8]).

The assumption of normality for the observations seems not to be rea-
sonable in the number of applications, such as signal processing, telecom-
munications, ﬁnance, physics and chemistry, and heavy-tailed distributions
seem to be more appropriate, see e.g.
[9]. An important class of distribu-
tions in this context is the class of α-stable (stable) distributions because
it is ﬂexible for data modelling and includes the Gaussian distribution as a
special case. The importance of this class of distributions is strongly sup-
ported by the limit theorems which indicate that the stable distribution
is the only possible limiting distribution for the normed sum of indepen-
dent and identically distributed random variables. Stable random variables
have found many practical applications, for instance in ﬁnance ([9]), physics
([10]), electrical engineering ([11]).

PARMA models with symmetric stable innovations combine the advan-
tages of classical PARMA models and stable distributions – they oﬀer an
alternative for modelling periodic time series with heavy tails. However,
in this case the covariance function is not deﬁned and thus other measures
of dependence have to be used. The most popular are the covariation and
codiﬀerence presented in [12, 13, 14].

In this paper we consider a special case of stable PARMA models, i.e.
PARMA(1,1) systems with symmetric α-stable innovations. In this case we
rewrite the equation (1) in a simple way, i.e.:

Xn − bnXn−1 = anξn,

where n ∈ Z and the coeﬃcients {bn} and {an} are nonzero periodic se-
quences with the same period T while the innovations are independent
symmetric α-stable (SαS for short) random variables given by the following
characteristic function:

E exp(iθξn) = exp(−σα|θ|α), 0 < α ≤ 2,

where σ denotes the scale parameter. Let us deﬁne P = b1b2 . . . bT and
Bs

j=r bj, with the convention Bs

r = 1 if r > s.

As the covariance function is not deﬁned for stable random vectors, in
Section 2 we present two other measures of dependence that can be used for
symmetric stable time series – the covariation and the codiﬀrence. In Section
3 we discuss the necessary conditions for existence of the bounded solution
of PARMA(1,1) systems for 1 < α ≤ 2 and we note that results obtained
in [3] for PARMA systems with Gaussian innovations can be extended to
the case of stable innovations. The covariation and the codiﬀerence for
PARMA(1,1) models with stable innovations are studied in Section 4 and
the asymptotic relation between these two measures of dependence for the
considered models is examined there. We ﬁnd it interesting to illustrate
theoretical results and thus in Section 5 we give an example of PARMA(1,1)
systems with SαS innovations and illustrate the periodicity of the considered
measures of dependence and the asymptotic relation between them.

2. Measures of dependence for stable time series

Let X and Y be jointly SαS and let Γ be the spectral measure of the
random vector (X, Y ) (see for instance [12]). If α < 2 then the covariance
is not deﬁned and thus other measures of dependence have to be used. The
most popular measures are: the covariation CV (X, Y ) of X on Y deﬁned
in the following way:

CV (X, Y ) =

Γ(ds),

1 < α ≤ 2,

(4)

s1s<α−1>
2

ZS2

where s = (s1, s2) and the signed power z<p> is given by z<p> = |z|p−1 ¯z,
and the codiﬀerence CD(X, Y ) of X on Y deﬁned for 0 < α ≤ 2:

CD(X, Y ) = ln E exp{i(X − Y )} − ln E exp{iX} − ln E exp{−iY }.

(5)

Properties of the considered measures of dependence one can ﬁnd in
[12]. Let us only mention here that, in contrast to the codiﬀerence, the
covariation is not symmetric in its arguments. Moreover, when α = 2 both
measures reduce to the covariance, namely

Cov(X, Y ) = 2CV (X, Y ) = CD(X, Y ).

(6)

The covariation induces a norm on the linear space of jointly SαS ran-
dom variables Sα and this norm is equal to the scale parameter, see [12].
Hence throughout this paper the norm (so-called covariation norm) ||X||α
is deﬁned by ||X||α = (CV (X, X))1/α, for a SαS random variable X and
α > 1. The sequence {Xn}n∈Z , is bounded in a space Sα with norm ||.||α if
supn∈Z ||Xn||α
α < ∞. Moreover, in this paper we write X = Y in Sα if and
only if ||X − Y ||α = 0.

4

If it is possible to transform the sequence {Xn} to the moving average
∞
representation Xn =
j=−∞ cj(n)ξn−j, where the innovations {ξn} are in-
dependent SαS random variables with parameters σ and 1 < α ≤ 2, then
both the covariation and the codiﬀerence can be expressed in terms of the
coeﬃcients cj(n) (see [15]):

3. Bounded solution of stable PARMA(1,1) system

In this section we consider PARMA(1,1) system given by (2) with the
SαS innovations for 1 < α < 2 and we investigate when the bounded solution
exists.

Let us assume that |P | < 1. In this case we show that the considered

PARMA(1,1) system has a bounded solution given by the formula:

Xn =

Bn

n−s+1an−sξn−s.

(7)

∞

Xs=0

Provided that every s ∈ Z can be represented as s = N T + j for some

N = 0, 1, . . . and j = 0, 1, . . . , T − 1, we have

||Xn||α

Moreover, it is easy to check that {Xn} given by (7) satisﬁes equation (2).

For each n ∈ Z and k = N T + j by periodicity of the coeﬃcients we have

of (2) then

It is worth pointing out here that the solution for the PARMA(1,1)
system with SαS innovations takes the same form of the moving average
as in the case of Gaussian innovations obtained in [3] and it reduces to
well-known formula for ARMA models in case of constant coeﬃcients.

4. Dependence structure of stable PARMA(1,1) models

Let us consider PARMA(1,1) system given by (2) with SαS innovations
for 1 < α ≤ 2. Moreover, we will restrict our attention to the case |P | < 1
because this case is more important for applications – as shown in Section
3, the considered system has a bounded solution {Xn} in the linear space
of jointly SαS random variables with norm ||.||α given by the causal moving
average representation (7).

In order to investigate the dependence structure of stable PARMA(1,1)

models we will ﬁrst rewrite Xn as Xn =

∞
s=−∞ cs(n)ξn−s, where

and then using results presented in Section 2 we will ﬁnd formulas for the
covariation and the codiﬀerence. We will also study periodicity of these
measures and their asymptotic relation.

The covariation. If n ≥ m, then for 1 < α ≤ 2 we have

It is easy to notice that z · z<α−1> = |z|α and Bn

As every s ∈ Z can be represented as s = N T + j for some N = 0, 1, . . .

Now it suﬃces to notice that by periodicity of coeﬃcients am−N T −j = am−j
and Bm

|P |N α = 1/(1 − |P |α). Thus

m−N T −j+1 = P N Bm

m−j+1 and that

As the sequences {an} and {bn} are periodic in n with period T , the covari-
ation is periodic in n and m with the same period, indeed CV (Xn, Xm) =
CV (Xn+T , Xm+T ).

And now it is suﬃcient to notice that the sum
been already calculated for the covariation. So we obtain

m−s+1am−s|α has

CD(Xn, Xm) = σα 1 + |Bn

m+1|α − |1 − Bn

It is not necessary to calculate the codiﬀerence for n < m as this mea-
for every n, m ∈ Z we have
sure is symmetric in its arguments,
CD(Xn, Xm) = CD(Xm, Xn). By the assumption, the coeﬃcients {an}
and {bn} are periodic in n with period T . Thus it is not diﬃcult to notice
that CD(Xn, Xm) = CD(Xn+T , Xm+T ), which means that the codiﬀerence
is periodic in n and m with the period T .

i.e.

Asymptotic relation between CV and CD. Using formulas (10),
(11) and (12) and two simple facts that hold for 1 < α < 2, 0 < |P | < 1
and any real constant a 6= 0:

lim
m→∞

1 + |aP m|α − |1 − aP m|α
aP m
aP m (1 + |aP m|α − |1 − aP m|α)
|aP m|α
it can be proved that for the considered PARMA(1,1) systems with SαS
innovations the following relations hold for each n ∈ Z and 1 < α < 2:

lim
m→∞

= α,

= 0,

lim

The interesting point is that, because of asymmetry of the covariance,
we obtained quite diﬀerent asymptotic results. Moreover, (13) extends the
results obtained in [13] for ARMA models and it reduces to (6) for α = 2.

5. Example

In order to illustrate our theoretical results let us consider PARMA(1,1)
model with SαS innovations with σ = 1, where the coeﬃcients are given by

bn = 




0.5
1.6,
0.4,

if n = 1, 4, 7, . . . ,
if n = 2, 5, 8, . . . ,
if n = 3, 6, 9, . . . ,

1
2,
0.003,

if n = 1, 4, 7, . . . ,
if n = 2, 5, 8, . . . ,
if n = 3, 6, 9, . . . .

an = 




It is clear that the coeﬃcients are periodic with T = 3 and in this case
P = 0.32. Therefore we are allowed to use formulas obtained in Sections 3
and 4. We ﬁrst want to demonstrate how the parameter α inﬂuences the
behaviour of the time series, so we plot 1000 realizations of the considered
model for α = 2, α = 1.7 and α = 1.4, see Figure 1. It is easy to notice
that the smaller α we take, the greater values of the time series can appear
(property of heavy-tailed distributions). Next, we want to show the depen-
dence structure of the considered model, especially periodicity of measures

of dependence. In order to do this we plot the codiﬀerence CD(Xn, Xn+k)
and the covariation CV (Xn, Xn+k) for α = 1.7 and α = 1.4 in case of k = 5,
see Figure 2. Although the behaviour of the measures of dependence de-
pends on the parameter α, one can observe that both measures are periodic
with the same period T = 3.

Finally, let us illustrate the asymptotic relation between the covariation
and the codiﬀerence that is studied in Section 4. Figure 3 contains plots of
the functions CD(Xn+k,Xn)
αCV (Xn,Xn+k) and CD(Xn−k,Xn)
αCV (Xn−k,Xn)
for k = 0, 1, . . . , 40, n = 50 and α = 1.7 and α = 1.4. According to the
theoretical results, the ﬁrst two quotients tend to 1 and the next two tend
to 0 as k increases.

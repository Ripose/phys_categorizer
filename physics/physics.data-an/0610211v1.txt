Abstract

We made a ﬁrst attempt to associate a probabilistic description of stochastic processes like

birth-death processes with spacetime geometry in the Schwarzschild metrics on distance scales

from the macro- to the micro-domains. We idealize an ergodic system in which system states

communicate through a curved path composed of transition arrows where each arrow corresponds

to a positive, analogous birth or death rate.

It is well known that stochastic processes can occur according to a simple 1D birth-and-

death model (see, e.g., [1, 2]). The probabilities pj at the system state j in this model are

obtained recursively from the relation

ˆµj pj(t) = ˆλj−1 pj−1(t)

(j = 1, 2 · · ·)

,

(1)

where by a choice of the birth ˆλj and death ˆµj rates various stochastic models can be con-
structed, e.g., cell populations, queueing, etc. Birth-death processes are Markow stochastic

processes where the states 1 ≤ j ≤ n represent the size of a ﬂuctuating population (of

system capacity n or greater) limited to births and deaths with pj(t) population proba-

bility distributions. The inﬁnitesimal population variation dn occuring during a time in-

terval dt is a random variable with possible values ±1. Its statistical expectation value is

E{dn} = (+1) × {P rob. of a birth at dt} + (−1) × {P rob. of a death at dt} , which

implies

E{dn} = (ˆλn − ˆµn) dt

.

(2)

The actual change in population of any one replicate can be written as dN/dt = ˆλn − ˆµn +
η(t)(ˆλn − ˆµn)1/2 where η(t) is a random variable with zero mean and unit variance. Thus

the expected system capacity change during dt is the same as would be predicted by a

determinitic model.

In this work we shall associate the probabilistic description of Eq.(1) of processes describ-

ing the behaviour of a stochastic physics system to space curvature within the Schwarzschild

description. The idea that the stochastic birth and death rates can be associated to some

geometric properties of spacetime derivated from general relativity framework is quite new

and interesting. We believe this association could be useful to imagine alternative views of

spacetime in a more comprehensible way, even though the notion of probability seems to be

purely epistemic within a theory of spacetime geometry like relativity [3].

The inﬁnitesimal radial distances in the Schwarzschild metrics, at ﬁxed polar angles θ

and φ and time t, satisfy [4]

dR ≡ (1 − 2m/r)−1/2dr ,

(3)

where m ≡ GM/c2, and M is the mass of the body producing the ﬁeld, G is the Gravitational

constant and c is the speed of light. The Schwarzschild isotropic solution is the basics for

the tests of general relativity, including the bending of the light and the spectral-shift.

2

This spacetime metric which leads to an exact solution of the Einstein ﬁeld equations

of general relativity in a static, spherically symmetric gravitational ﬁeld has been assumed

to be valid even at microscopic scales.

In particular, the superposition of (N-electrons)

quantum states over the 10cm scale human brain has been estimated to last for millions of
years using a free electron Schwarzschild radius of about 1.35 × 10−55cm [5]. On the other

hand, elementary particles have also been studied under the perspectives of microscopic

black holes [6, 7]. This microworld scheme suggests that the black hole mass spectrum in

quantum theory is discrete such that the black hole horizon area is conﬁned to equaly spaced

levels whose degeneracy corresponds to the black hole entropy [8].

Thus, in principle, the universe we live in may consist of an inhomogeneous density

of matter (in the form of starts, molecules, atoms, etc), that curve space due to their

gravitational ﬁelds on scales ranging from the size of the observable universe to the micro-

world. Intuitively, all of this makes sense at least up to a submolecular order of magnitude in

which the force of gravity cannot be negligible compared to other fundamental forces found

in nature.

It is not unreasonable to consider then the possibility of extending the Schwarzschild

metric to the vicinity of multiple massive objects, due to the inhomogeneous presence of

matter in the universe at diﬀerent geometrical scales. When M 6= 0, the curvature of space

implies that dR > dr and the coordinates not necessarily have the physical meaning as they

have in a ﬂat space where time is measured by clocks -stationary in the reference system

employed, and r is a radial distance from the origin.

As shown in Fig.1 (for each of the interconnected surfaces illustrated), So represents a

portion of ﬂat space (with M −→ 0), while the (nested) curved surface Sm represents a

portion of the curved space. The circles C1 and C3 represent spheres of radius r while the

circles C2 and C4 represent spheres of radius r + dr, embedded in an Euclidean space.

Let us extend Eq.(3) and consider a system of nested curved surfaces Sm to form a spiral

of n-curved surfaces as illustrated in the ﬁgure which are interconnected in the sense that

dR(1) ≡ (1 − 2m(1)/R)−1/2dR ,

dR(2) ≡ (1 − 2m(2)/R(1))−1/2dR(1)

,

· · ·

· · ·

3

dR(n) ≡ (1 − 2m(n)/R(n−1))−1/2dR(n−1)

,

(4)

In other words we are simply assuming the space to be curved at all geometric scales dR(n)

due to the presence of scattered matter M (i) 6= 0 (i = 0, 1, · · · , n) with M (0) ≡ m.

It

is enough to select an inﬁnitesimal dR(n) for large n in order all other radial distances

dR(n) > · · · > dR > dr to be also inﬁnitesimal.

Let us deﬁne next the R-dependent trial functions λ and µ, to be indentiﬁed below, as

λ(n) ⇀↽ (R(n) − R(n+1)
µ(n) ⇀↽ R(n−1)/rs

where R(n)

s are Schwarzschild radii at which the metric of Eq.(3) becomes singular for positive

n ≥ 1, namely

R(n)

s =

2GM (n)
c2

,

such that R(0)

s ≡ rs = 2m. The ratio λ/µ tends to 0 as R → Rs and it tends to unity as
R → ∞ (or, alternatively, M (n) → 0). Using Eqs.(4) and (5), the ratio of their product

satisﬁes in particular

where we have set R(0) ≡ R and P (0)(r) ≡ (r − rs)/r ≡ (dr/dR)2 < 1.

It is then straightforward to establish the general recursive relation

such that

at ﬁxed time and (along a ﬁxed path of) polar angles. The latter is our master equation

relating space geometry to an iterative (n-process) function.

In view of the above we could then associate Eq.(9) to Eq.(1) in analogy to birth-death

types of processes (projection-like operators). The analogous ’birth’ and ’death’ rates being

deﬁned by Eq.(5) when the system is in a given state n. The left side of Eq.(9) becomes an

analogous eﬀective rate at which the system is leaving the state n because of the analogous

decaying processes (deaths), and the right side becomes the eﬀective rate at which the system

is entering state n because of analogous births.

Within this analogy, a large number of aggregating processes would change as a function

of distance R acting collectively to pass on information or to introduce system disorder

(via the information like entropy −P (n) ln P (n) > 0). In this case from the deﬁnition of the

Schwarzschild radii of Eq.(6) we write for the scattered matter

Since M is ﬁnite, then µ(n+1) 6= λ(n) or µ(n) 6= λ(n−1). In a ﬂat space dR −→ dr, then system

is in an analogous state n = 1 and λ → µ.

The above relation means that variations of an analogous coeﬃcient of system energy

could be related to the diﬀerence between some ’annihilated’ analogous processes of leaving

state n and those being ’generated’ in the state n.

If this is the case, we may look at

the function P (n) in Eq.(10) as an analogous probability measure provided the sum over n

diﬀerent states satisﬁes the normalization condition

n

P (i)(r) =

= 1 .

Xi=0  
Let us analyse next if this normalization condition is rigorously valid. From Eq.(8) we can

Xi=0

see that P (n) is completely determined by the value of P (0) at each distance. On physics

grounds we have that r > rs, hence 1 > P (0) ≡ (r − rs)/r > 0 and P (n) > 0. This means

that the normalization condition for an anologous topological probability directly relates

the singularity of Schwarzschild’s metrics (black hole horizon) rs. Then it only remains to

choose P (0), such that the associated (or analogous) probabilities {P (i)} sum to unity ∀r.

Similarly to birth-death stochastic processes [1, 2], for large n one can choose

where ρi is deﬁned by i-products of birth-death ratios λ(i−1) · · · λ(0)/µ(i) · · · µ(1). For n ≥ 1,

these ratios get small suﬃciently rapidly because the trial associations in Eq.(5) plus the fact
that R > 0 ∀i, imply the limits 0 < λ(i−1)/µ(i) = 1 − (R(i)

s /R(i−1)) < 1. Hence

unique normalized solution of an equivalent equation of motion of a population probability

distribution [1, 2].

We can also derive a recurrence relation for the universal time coordinate. Inﬁnitesimal

proper time intervals for a clock at a ﬁxed distance in space are given by dτ ≡ (1−2m/r)1/2dt,

such that in the curved space dτ < dt. By a similar analysis to that leading to Eq.(9), we

obtain (dτ (n)/dt)2 < 1 after n-iteration processes. In terms of a temporal translation this

quantity is always positive at diﬀerent scales. This could be seen as a forward positive direc-

tion for the ”real” time in the direction in which disorder (i.e., positive entropy) increases.

The trial functions deﬁned by Eq.(5) are strictly deterministic. Next, they have been

turned stochastic via Eq.(9). So what is the source of randomness in our approach? The

answer is as follows. Integrating Eq.(12) with respect to any one of a countable number of

system states n, and using Eq.(5), it gives

This means that the inﬁnitesimal geometrical variation dR(n) occuring during a system state

interval dn corresponds to an analogous random variable and some 0 < η < 1 ﬂuctuations

in the Schwarzschild radii R(n)

s

are our source of randomness. Generally randomness for

birth-and-death processes can come from competition selection [9], environment pressure

[10], random particle ﬂuctuations [11] or random noise [12].

Our goal here has been to connect some concepts from stochastic processes (in the

form of birth/death rates) to concepts of topology, in particular to space curvature in the

Schwarzschild simplest (isotropic) metrics. Thus, the starting points have been the birth-

death generic equation, Eq.(1) and the Schwarzschild metrics, Eq.(3). The core of the paper

6

is the general recursive relation for Schwarzschild radii, Eq.(9) in which a probability is

assigned to the ﬁrst term of the recurrence and two trial functions geometrically deﬁned in

Eq.(5), are assimilated to the birth and death rates. In this way, Eq.(9) becomes similar

with a birth-and-death stochastic equation, and allows for deﬁning the system statistical en-

ergy (and thereof the entropy) of Eq.(12) such that the normalization condition of Eq.(13)

implies to deal with distance scales greater than the Schwarzschild radius rs. The ratios
λ(n−1)/µ(n) decay to zero suﬃciently rapidly for n ≥ 1. We have assumed that the system

is ergodic –i.e., all n-states of the system communicate through a curved path composed of

transition arrows, each arrow corresponding to a positive birth or death rate.

In the light of this simple description diﬀerent physics theories –corresponding to diﬀer-

ent averaging scales (from, say, particle physics to astrophysics), may be associated via a

geometric approach to probabilities [13]. One could deduce the metric, which allows a non-

inertial observer to perform experiments in spacetime [14], via a probabilistic approach and

vice versa. However, to understand the underlying order in the world a metric independence

would be more encopassing.

We regard the present ideas as a toy approach only. Toy models to search for a solution

to spacetime problems in physics are not new. An example is the toy model providing an

extension of the dimensionality of spacetime, with an additional spatial dimension which is

macroscopically unobservable [15].

So far our approach has no output variables.

It could become more reliable if some

universality of generation-annihilation mechanisms are found to have similar features at the

microscopic, mesoscopic and microsopic scales as suggested by Fig.1. An indication of univer-

sality though is given by the general ﬂuctuation theorem derived from Jarzynski’s inequality

for univariate birth-death processes driven out of equilibium by the external variation of a

control parameter [16, 17]. This is so because the theory of birth-and-death processes has

been applied independently on astrophysics [18], biophysics [19] and quantum physics [20]

and the ﬂuctuation theorem becomes valid in each of these situations.

The recurrence equations (9) can be interpreted as an equivalent conservation of radial

distance ﬂow relation (i.e., rate up = rate down). That is, the long radio rate at which

the system of nested surfaces moves up from state n to n + 1 equals the rate at which the

system moves down from state n + 1 to n. Thus our analogous birth-death process describes

an evolution in radial distance whose values increases or decreases (stochastically) by one

7

single state starting from an analogous ground probability state P (0). In an universe seen at

diﬀerent scales, averaged eﬀects of small-scale inhomogenities may alter both observational

and dynamical relations at the larger scale [21]. Probability could be then consistent with

the full ﬁlling of the whole space with nested curved surfaces. There is no a priori speciﬁed

time and one would ultimately expect measured time to be increasingly positive or future

oriented.

It is tempting to relate this ﬁrst attempt, based on gravity and stochastic processes

associated via Eq.(10), to a theory that relies on interactions between particles such as

that of quantum mechanics and the probabilistic interpretation of wave functions |ψ(r)|2

[22]. Our hope is to stimulate further investigations in this direction despite such possibility

may not have at present convincing physical ramiﬁcations and this paper may look rather

metaphysical.

Abstract

Power spectrum densities for the number of tick quotes per minute
(market activity) on three currency markets (USD/JPY, EUR/USD,
and JPY/EUR) for periods from January 1999 to December 2000 are
analyzed. We ﬁnd some peaks on the power spectrum densities at
a few minutes. We develop the double-threshold agent model and
conﬁrm that stochastic resonance occurs for the market activity of
this model. We propose a hypothesis that the periodicities found
on the power spectrum densities can be observed due to stochastic
resonance.

1 Introduction

In the past few years there has been increasing interest in the investigation of
ﬁnancial markets as complex systems in statistical mechanics. The empirical
analysis of the high frequency ﬁnancial data reveals nonstationary statistics

1

of market ﬂuctuations and several mathematical models of markets based on
the concept of the nonequilibrium phenomena have been proposed [1, 2].

Recently Mizuno et al. investigate high frequency data of the USD/JPY
exchange market and conclude that dealers’ perception and decision are
mainly based on the latest 2 minutes data [3]. This result means that there
are feedback loops of information in the foreign currency market.

As microscopic models of ﬁnancial markets some agent models are pro-
posed [4, 5, 6, 7]. Speciﬁcally Ising-like models are familiar to statistical
physicists and have been examined in the context of econophysics. The anal-
ogy to the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition is used to explain crashes
and bubbles. Krawiecki et al. consider the eﬀect of a weak external force
acting on the agents in the Ising model of the ﬁnancial market and con-
clude that apparently weak stimuli from outside can have potentially eﬀect
on ﬁnancial market due to stochastic resonance [8]. This conclusion indicates
that it is possible to observe the eﬀect of the external stimuli from the market
ﬂuctuations.

Motivated by their conclusion we investigate high-frequency ﬁnancial data
and ﬁnd a potential evidence that stochastic resonance occurs in ﬁnancial
markets.
In this article the results of data analysis are reported and the
agent-based model is proposed in order to explain this phenomenon.

2 Analysis

We analyze tick quotes on three foreign currency markets (USD/JPY, EUR/USD,
and JPY/EUR) for periods from January 1999 to December 2000 [9]. This
database contains time stamps, prices, and identiﬁers of either ask or bid.
Since generally market participants (dealers) must indicate both ask and bid
prices in foreign currency markets the nearly same number of ask and bid
oﬀering are recorded in the database. Here we focus on the ask oﬀering
and regard the number of ask quotes per unit time (one minute) A(t) as
the market activity. The reason why we deﬁne the number of ask quotes
as the market activity is because this quantity represents amount of dealers’
responses to the market.

In order to elucidate temporal structure of the market activity power

spectrum densities of A(t), estimated by

where f represents frequency, and T a maximum period of the power spec-
trum density, are calculated. Figs. 1, 2, and 3 show the power spectrum
densities for three foreign currency markets (USD/JPY, UER/USD, and

have some peaks at the high frequency region.

There is a peak at 2.5 minutes on the USD/JPY market, at 3 minutes
on the EUR/USD market, and there are some peaks on the JPY/EUR. We
conﬁrm that these peaks appear and disappear depending on observation
periods. On the USD/JPY market there is the peak for periods of January
1999–July 1999, March 2000–April 2000, and August 2000–November 2000;
on the EUR/USD market July 1999–September 1999; and on the EUR/JPY
market January 1999–March 1999, April 1999–June 1999, November 1999,
and July 2000–December 2000.

These peaks mean that market participants oﬀer quotes periodically and
in synchronization. The possible reasons for these peaks to appear in the
power spectrum densities of the market activity are follows:

1. The market participants are aﬀected by common periodic information.

2. The market participants are spontaneously synchronized.

In the next section the double-threshold agent model is introduced and ex-
plain this phenomenon on the basis of the reason (1).

3 Double-threshold agent model

Here we consider a microscopic model for ﬁnancial markets in order to explain
the dependency of the peak height on observation periods. We develop the
double-threshold agent model based on the threshold dynamics.

In foreign exchange markets the market participants attend the markets
with utilizing electrical communication devices, for example, telephones, tele-
grams, and computer networks. They are driven by both exogenous and en-
dogenous information and determine their investment attitudes. Since the
information to motivate buying and one of selling are opposite to each other
we assume that the information is a scaler variable. Moreover the market par-
ticipants perceive the information and determine their investment attitude
based on the information. The simplest model of the market participant is
an element with threshold dynamics.

We consider a ﬁnancial market consisting of N market participants having
three kinds of investment attitudes: buying, selling, and doing nothing. Re-
cently we developed an array of double-threshold noisy devices with a global
feedback [10]. Applying this model to the ﬁnancial market we construct
three decision model with double thresholds and investigate the dependency
of market behavior on an exogenous stimuli.

The investment attitude of the ith dealer yi(t) at time t is determined
by his/her recognition for the circumstances xi(t) = s(t) + zi(t), where s(t)
represents the investment environment, and zi(t) the ith dealer’s prediction

The excess demand is given by the sum of investment attitudes over the

market participants,

The dealers determine their investment attitude based on exogenous fac-
tors (fundamentals) and endogenous factors (market price changes). Gen-
erally speaking, the prediction of the ith dealer zi(t) is determined by a
complicated strategy described as a function with respect to historical mar-

It is assumed that the dealers’ response can be separated by common and

individual factors,

ai(t) = ζ(t) + ηi(t),

(7)

where ζ(t) denotes the common factor, and ηi(t) the individual factor. Gen-
erally these factors are time-dependent and seem to be complicated functions
of both exogenous and endogenous variables.

For simplicity it is assumed that these factors vary rapidly in the limit
manner. Then this model becomes well-deﬁned in the stochastic manner.
We assume that ζ(t) and ηi(t) are sampled from the following identical and
independent Gaussian distributions, respectively:

This agent model has nine model parameters. We ﬁx N = 100, Bi = 0.01,
0.01, γ = 0.1, ση = 0.01, and a = 0.0 throughout all numerical
Si =
simulations.
It is assumed that an exogenous periodic information to the
market is subject to s(t) = q0 sin(2π∆tf t) at q0 = 0.001, f = 0.8 and ∆t = 1.
We calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the market activity as a

function of σξ. The SNR is deﬁned as

SNR = log10

S
N

,

(11)

where S represents a peak height of the power spectrum density, and N noise
level.

From the numerical simulation we ﬁnd non-monotonic dependency of the
SNR of q(t) on σξ. Fig. 4 shows a relation between the SNR and the noise
strength σξ. It has an extremal value around σξ = 0.0035. Namely the un-
certainty of decision-making plays a constructive role to enhance information
transmission. If there are exogenous periodic information and the uncertainty
of decision-making we can ﬁnd the peak on power spectrum densities at ap-
propriate uncertainty of decision-making due to stochastic resonance [12].

5 Conclusion

We analyzed time series of the number of tick quotes (market activity) and
found there are short-time periodicities in the time series. The existence and
positions of these peaks of the power spectrum densities depend on foreign
currency markets and observation periods. The power spectrum densities
have a peak at 2.5 minutes on the USD/JPY market, 3 minutes on the
EUR/USD. There are some peaks at a few minutes on the JPY/EUR.

We developed the double-threshold agent model for ﬁnancial markets
where the agents choose three kinds of states and have feedback strategies to
determine their decision aﬀected by last price changes. From the numerical
simulation we conﬁrmed that the information transmission is enhanced due
to stochastic resonance related to the uncertainty of decision-making of the
market participants. We propose a hypothesis that the periodicities of the
market activity can be observed due to stochastic resonance.

Appearance and disappearance of these peaks may be related to the eﬃ-
ciency of the markets. The eﬃciency market hypothesis [13] says that prices

information. If the peaks of the power spectrum densities come from exoge-
nous information then SNR is related to the eﬃciency of the market. Namely
the market may be eﬃcient when the peaks appear.

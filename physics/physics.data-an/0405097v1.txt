Abstract

Stress time series from the PLC effect typically exhibit stick-slips of upload and

download type. These data contain strong short-term correlations of a nonlinear type.

We investigate whether there are also long term correlations, i.e. the successive up-

down patterns are generated by a deterministic mechanism. A statistical test is con-

ducted for the null hypothesis that the sequence of the up-down patterns is totally

random. The test is constructed by means of surrogate data, suitably generated to

represent the null hypothesis. Linear and nonlinear estimates are used as test statis-

tics, namely autocorrelation, mutual information and Lyapunov exponents, which are

found to have proper performance for the test. The test is then applied to three stress

1

time series under different experimental conditions. Rejections are obtained for one of

them and not with all statistics. From the overall results we cannot conclude that the

underlying mechanism to the PLC effect has long memory.

1 Introduction

The Portevin-Le Châtelier (PLC) effect or jerky ﬂow is one of the best studied forms of

plastic instability in many metallic alloys when tensile specimens are deformed in a certain

range of strain rates and temperatures. A distinct characteristic of PLC effect is the up-load

and down-load behavior of the total stress vs time curves, due to the pinning / unpinning

of lattice dislocations [1]. As a result, the stress time series is comprised of successive

stick-slip patterns, i.e. slow rather linear up-trends followed by fast down-trends. Simple

physically-based mathematical models, suggested in the literature, reproduce partially this

feature [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Recently, data analysis using nonlinear methods give evidence for

nonlinear and chaotic behavior [7, 8, 9].

Nonlinear methods, mostly based on chaos theory, have been applied to real data from

different ﬁelds with varying success [10, 11]. These methods provide estimates of dy-

namical characteristics of the underlying system, such as topological or fractal dimenion,

entropy and Lyapunov exponent, as well as sophisticated data driven models. However, the

estimates are meaningful if there is evidence that the underlying system is indeed nonlin-

ear deterministic and eventually chaotic. Regarding the nonlinearity in the data, an indirect

approach, namely testing the null hypothesis that the data are linear stochastic, has gained

much interest in the last years. The test employs surrogate data to form the empirical distri-

bution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis [12, 13, 14].

2

The methodology of nonlinear dynamics, including the surrogate data test for nonlin-

earity has been applied recently to data from the PLC effect. In a number of experiments

of occurrence of the PLC effect, nonlinear techniques were used aiming at characterising

the structure of the stress times series. Within certain experimental range, jerky ﬂow was

reported to exhibit chaotic behaviour for single crystals of Cu-Al alloys [8, 5] as well as

for Al-Mg polycrystals [9, 7]. Moreover, for both crystals, the surrogate data test gave evi-

dence for the existence of nonlinear dynamics. However, one could argue that this evidence

is solely due to the presence of strong deterministic structure at small time scales within the

upload or download phase, a quite obvious form of nonlinear dynamics.

In this work, we direct the statistical analysis to a different time scale. We focus on cor-

relations at a larger time scale that spans over the stick-slips, that is we investigate whether

there is long term deterministic structure in addition to the short term nonlinear dynamics

that forms the stick-slip patterns. The data analysis is done by means of hypothesis testing,

where the null hypothesis is that the stick–slip sequence is random. For this we introduce

an algorithm generating surrogate data with the same stick-slip patterns at a random order

and we apply several linear and nonlinear statistics. We use three stress time series from

single crystals at different experimental conditions.

The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, the stress data are described and in

Section 3, the results of the standard nonlinear analysis on these are reviewed. In Section 4,

the surrogate test for the hypothesis of random stick–slips is described, and in Section 5, the

results of the application of the test to the stress data are presented. Finally, a discussion

follows in Section 6.

2 The Stress Data

The stress time series are recordings of the total stress of single crystal Cu-10% Al under

compression at a constant strain rate (these time series were used in [15]). The notation

and some speciﬁcations for the data sets are given in Table 1. The selected records from the

experiments regard plastic deformation giving successive slow up-load and rapid down-load

of stress. Table 1 to be placed here

3 Review of the Nonlinear Analysis of the Stress Data

Recently, it has been shown that the stress time series at low and medium strain rates are

nonlinear and chaotic using standard nonlinear methods based on chaos theory [8, 5]. We

start by reviewing these results on a particular time series, S1, described in Section 2.

The stress time series and a segment of this is shown in Fig. 1 (top pannel). The structure

of successive stick–slip patterns for this stress range clearly indicates that the underlying

system is deterministic at small time scales. The other stress time series listed in Table 1

show the same feature of stick-slips. There is no ambiguity at the level of sampling time

as to the evolution of the up-load stress (stick phase); it is simply a linear upward trend.

The same holds for the slip phase, which is much shorter and thus the slope of the down-

ward trend is very large. This ﬁne piecewise linear stress evolution cannot be generated by

conventional stochastic Markov chain models, such as ARMA models, neither by a linear

deterministic system. It is therefore of no surprise that the estimates from nonlinear meth-

ods applied to this type of time series suggest nonlinear deterministic structure (for a review

on nonlinear methods refer to [16, 10, 11]).

4

The presence of nonlinear short-term dynamics can also be established statistically, test-

ing the null hypothesis H0 that the stress time series is generated by a linear (Gaussian)

process, perturbed by a static, possibly nonlinear, transform [12, 13, 14]. The transform

is included in H0 to explain deviations from Gaussian amplitude distribution of the data,

which is often observed in real time series. The test involves the generation of an ensemble

of surrogate data, i.e. time series that represent the null hypothesis, and the computation of a

test statistic q, here an estimate from a nonlinear method, on the original and surrogate data.

If the estimate q0 on the original data does not lie within the empirical distribution of q un-

der H0, formed by the estimates q1, q2, . . . , qM on the M surrogates, then H0 is rejected and

it is unlikely that the original time series is linear stochastic. The statistics q1, q2, . . . , qM

form typically a normal-like distribution. Therefore the deviation of the statistic q0 on the

original data from the distribution of q under H0 is quantiﬁed by the signiﬁcance S deﬁned

as

S =

|q0 − ¯q|
sq

,

(1)

where ¯q and sq are the average and standard deviation of q1, q2, . . . , qM , respectively. The

rejection region for H0 is formed by a lower limit for S given from the critical value of

standard normal distribution at a prespeciﬁed conﬁdence level. If S > 1.96, H0 is rejected

at the 95% conﬁdence level.

One could easily discriminate the surrogate data (consistent to the abovementioned H0)

from the original stress data solely by eyeball judgement. As shown in Fig. 1 (middle panel),

the surrogate time series fails to capture the special feature of the original data. The sur-

rogate time series used in this Section are generated using the STAP algorithm, recently

presented in [17]. The same results were obtained using the AAFT and IAAFT algorithms

5

(for a review on the algorithms and their performance see [18]). The surrogate data are

designed to mimic the original time series in terms of amplitude distribution and autocor-

relation and are otherwise random. These two conditions are apparently not sufﬁcient to

preserve the stick–slip patterns of the stress data.

In Fig. 2, we show estimates of the autocorrelation, mutual information and largest Lya-

punov exponent on the original stress data and 40 STAP surrogate time series (for review

on these methods see [16, 10, 11])1.

The results on autocorrelation r(τ ) for τ = 1, . . . , 50τs, conﬁrm that the STAP sur-

rogate data have the same linear structure as the original time series The other two mea-

sures are both nonlinear. The mutual information I(τ ) measures the general correlation,

linear and nonlinear. The discrepancy in I(τ ) for the original and the surrogate data,

shown in Fig. 2b, suggests that the original data contain nonlinear correlations and there-

fore give larger mutual information for a long range of lags. The largest Lyapunov ex-

ponent λ1(m) measures the rate of divergence in the evolution of nearby trajectories in a

reconstructed state space of dimension m. Chaotic and stochastic systems have positive λ1,

and large positive λ1 indicate high complexity or stochasticity. As shown in Fig. 2c, the

original data obtain signiﬁcantly larger λ1(m) for the whole range of embedding dimen-

sions m = 1, . . . , 10, which indicates that they exhibit more complexity than the surrogate

data. For both nonlinear statistics the signiﬁcance S takes very high values giving rejection

of H0 at essentially 100% conﬁdence level. The same results were established with other

generation algorithms for the surrogate data and other nonlinear estimates, i.e. correlation

dimension and ﬁtting error of local averages.

1The algorithms in the TISEAN software were used, see [19].

6

The nonlinear time series analysis we have done so far could reproduce a quite evident

result, i.e. the stress time series contains nonlinear dynamics at small time scale. A more

interesting question we investigate next is whether there is any evidence of determinism or

correlation in the evolution of the stick–slip patterns of the stress time series.

4 Surrogate Data Test for Sequence of Patterns

We employ the statistical approach of surrogate data testing discussed in Section 3, but the

working H0 now is that the succession of the stick–slip patterns is random, i.e. the stick–

slip states are independent. The surrogate data for this H0 should have the same stick–slip

structure as the stress data, but at a random order.

4.1 The SUDT algorithm

We have built an algorithm, called Stochastic Up-Down Trends (SUDT), to generate the

surrogate data for this H0. The algorithm permutates randomly the stick–slips of the original

time series taking care that the range of the original data is retained. Speciﬁcally, the steps

of the algorithm are as follows:

1. Scan the original time series x = [x1, x2, . . . , xn]′, identify and store the up-down

trend patterns, as well as the global minimum xmin, the global maximum xmax, the

smallest end-point of the up-trend xu and the largest end point of the down-trend xd.

2. The surrogate time series z to be constructed starts at the same data point as x, i.e.

z1 = x1 (a random point could be chosen as well).

3. Using discrete uniform distribution, draw randomly an up-down trend segment from

7

those stored in step 1, and displace it so that its starting point coincides with the

currently last point of the time series z (for the ﬁrst iteration this is z1).

4. Check whether the “up” end-point of the chosen up-down trend segment is between

xu and xmax, and the “down” end-point is between xmin and xd. If the two end-points

are within the given limits, then accept the up-down trend (the “down” end-point of

the accepted trend is now the last data point of the time series). If not, then discard

the up-down trend and repeat step 3.

5. Repeat the last two steps until the time series z is as long as the original time series

(eventually truncating the last eligible trend).

Note that the algorithm assumes that the original time series starts with an upward trend.

We adjust accordingly the data sets by dropping a few samples from the beginning if neces-

sary. Alternatively, one can simply reverse the magnitudes of the original data (e.g. multiply

by -1) before applying the algorithm.

This algorithm implements bootstrapping on blocks of data, i.e.

the up-down trends

from the original time series, allowing repetitions of the same block of data in the surrogate

time series. Simple shufﬂing of the original trends cannot be done because the end-points

have to match.

It was found necessary to constrain the random selection of the up-down trends using

lower and upper limits for both the “up” and “down” end-points of each trend in order to

keep the generated surrogate time series z within the bounds of the original data. The use

of the global minimum and maximum (xmin and xmax) alone led to edge effect problems,

so the additional limits of xu and xd had to be introduced to assure robust execution of the

8

algorithm. This increases the frequency of discarding randomly selected up-down trends

and mars the random order of the up-down trends.

4.2 Examples with simulated data

The surrogate data generated by the SUDT algorithm represent the H0 of independent stick–

slip states in the time series. Certainly, the stick–slip states of the original data may be

correlated implying that the underlying mechanism exhibits a deterministic structure on

longer time scales, which is an interesting possible aspect for the PLC effect.

Using simulated data, we show that the standard methods of time series analysis have ac-

tually discriminative power and can distinguish the original time series from its SUDT sur-

rogates only when this is the case. For this, we use deterministic and stochastic time series

of the stick-slip type. For the deterministic case, we use 2000 data of the log–transformed

w variable of the Rössler hyperchaos system [20], sampled at time τs = 0.1sec, call it xd.

This time series exhibits stick–slip structure. For the stochastic case (time series with ran-

dom stick–slip states), we simply use a time series derived by the SUDT algorithm on xd,

call it xs. Two segments of the two time series are shown in Fig. 3a. Note that the time

series xd and xs have the same structure and cannot be distinguished by eyeball judgement.

In the generation of 40 SUDT surrogates, there were on average 48 rejections of candidate

stick-slips for xd (which is comprised of 193 stick–slip patterns) and about the same for xs,

so that the shufﬂing can indeed be considered random. The SUDT surrogate data for each

of the two time series possess similar amplitude distribution to the original ones, as shown

in Fig. 3b. The same holds for the distribution of the up and down velocities and for the

distribution of the up and down times. The preservation of all these distributions signiﬁes

9

the successful performance of the SUDT algorithm.

We apply the linear and nonlinear test statistics on xd, xs and their respective SUDT sur-

rogates. The results are shown in Fig. 4. The autocorrelation r(τ ) does not discriminate xs

from its SUDT surrogates, as expected, but the same holds for xd (see Fig. 4a). Speciﬁcally

for xd, rejection of H0 at the 95% conﬁdence level could only be established for a small

range of delays around τ = 5, as shown in Fig. 4d. So, for the chaotic time series from

Rössler hyperchaos the linear test statistic has essentially no discriminative power. Note

that there is no reason to believe that this is always the case with deterministic systems.

However, the same results were obtained also on a quasi-periodic system with stick–slip

structure (a two torus, for description of the system see [21]).

The chaotic deterministic data xd are correctly distinguished from their respective SUDT

surrogates with both nonlinear statistics, i.e. the mutual information I(τ ) and the largest

Lyapunov exponent λ1(m), as shown in Fig. 4b and c. Subsequently, the H0 of indepen-

dent stick–slip states is rejected at the 95% conﬁdence levels for a long range of the free

parameter of its statistic (see Fig. 4e and f). On the other hand, the xs data are correctly

not distinguished from their respective SUDT surrogates by either λ1(m) or I(τ ), and H0

is not rejected for any value of the free parameter of the two statistics. Very similar results

were obtained on the quasi-periodic system (where S obtained larger values for the deter-

ministic system) as well as when using other nonlinear statistics, e.g. local average maps

and entropy.

These ﬁndings show that even standard nonlinear statistics that are not tailored for

this particular test can distinguish correctly correlated stick–slip states from non-correlated

stick–slip states of similar shape.

10

5 Application of the Test to the Stress Data

In order to avoid false local minima and maxima the stress time series were smoothed using

a ﬁnite impulse response ﬁlter prior to the identiﬁcation of the stick–slips. Note that there

was no further use of the smoothed time series and the shufﬂing in the SUDT algorithm

was done on the original stick–slips. The SUDT surrogate time series preserve well the

stick–slip patterns of all the PLC stress time series. In Fig. 1, this is shown for the stress

time series S1 and one SUDT surrogate of this (upper and lower pannel, respectively).

For the surrogate data to be proper for the test, we require good match of the distribu-

tion of the data, the distribution of the velocity of the up and down trends, as well as the

distribution of the time of the up and down trends. The velocity and time distributions were

preserved in the SUDT surrogates for all three stress time series. The amplitude distribu-

tion was well preserved for S2, sufﬁciently preserved for S1 and not preserved for S3, as

shown in Fig. 5. It turns out that the stick–slip time series generated by the SUDT algo-

rithm tend to possess symmetric amplitude distribution, so that when the original data have

skewed distribution (as is the case with S3) deviations in amplitude distribution do occur

(see Fig. 5c). This constitutes a shortcoming of the SUDT algorithm to provide proper

stick–slip surrogates. So, whenever the amplitude distribution is not preserved one may

question the outcome of the test as deviations in the test statistics that may lead to rejection

of H0 may be assigned to the mismatch of amplitude distribution.

In Fig. 6, the outcome of the test using the three test statistics is shown. The linear

statistic r(τ ) distinguishes the time series S1 from its 40 surrogates (for a long range of τ ),

but not S2. For S3, the r(τ ) for the SUDT surrogates is much higher (accordingly, S takes

very high values not shown in Fig. 6d for τ ≤ 13), but this mismatch may be due to the

11

lack of match in amplitude distribution, so it cannot be regarded as genuine discrimination

that would correspond to rejection of H0. Therefore, the clear rejection for S3 also with the

nonlinear statistics are not reliable.

It should be noted that for S1, the original r(τ ) for τ < 40 is actually smaller in ampli-

tude than for the surrogates suggesting the opposite of the alternative hypothesis we attempt

to establish, i.e. the surrogate data involve more correlations than the original data. A pos-

sible explanation for this would be the discrepancy at the bulk of the amplitude distribution

between S1 and its surrogates (see Fig. 5a). We note also that sucl long range correlations

are often due to drift in the data.

The I(τ ) statistic that measures both linear and nonlinear correlations is at the same

level for S1 and its SUDT surrogates, as shown in Fig. 6b. Compared to the results with

r(τ ), it seems that S1 contains nonlinear correlations not present in the SUDT surrogates.

However, S is below the threshold for rejection of H0 at the 95% conﬁdence level for all

but very small τ (see Fig. 6e). The λ1(m) statistic shows also a difference in nonlinear

correlations between S1 and its surrogates giving conﬁdent rejections at the 95% level for

m > 2, as shown in Fig. 6c and f.

The stress time series S2 could not be discriminated from its SUDT surrogates with any

of the three statistics, indicating that it has no correlations between stick–slips.

The results on the three stress time series suggest that there is not enough statistical evi-

dence to establish that the stick–slip states of the stress time series from plastic deformation

of single crystals are correlated and thus that there is a deterministic system at large time

scales that controls the evolution of the stick–slip states.

12

6 Discussion

It is plausible that the evolution of the stress in the PLC effect is rather deterministic at short

time scales as the stress time series has a characteristic stick-slip structure. We employed

statistical testing to investigate whether there is a deterministic mechanism that controls the

stress at larger time scales that span over the duration of the stick-slip states. The standard

surrogate data test for nonlinearity, used recently to establish determinism and nonlinearity

for the PLC effect, is not suitable for the question of interest as the surrogate data do not pre-

serve the stick-slip structure. Subsequently, the disrcimination between original stress time

series and surrogate data (generated under the null hypothesis of linear stochastic system)

is guaranteed. However, this result does not establish the presence of correlations between

the stick–slips that should be present if the underlying mechanism is nonlinear determinis-

tic. Indeed, our simulations showed that time series comprised of uncorrelated stick–slips

are also discriminated from this type of surrogates, questioning the appropriateness of the

surrogate data test for nonlinearity for this type of time series.

We designed the SUDT algorithm to generate surrogate data of stick–slip structure and

performed the surrogate data test for the null hypothesis of independent stick-slip states.

Nonlinear statistics as the ones used for the test for nonlinearity turned out to perform ap-

propriately when applied to simulated data. However, the power of the statistics on chaotic

time series with stick-slip structure was not as high as for the quasi-periodic systems.

We applied this test on three stress time series from plastic deformation of single crystal

Cu-10% Al under compression at different strain rates. We used one linear test statistic,

i.e. the autocorrelation, and two nonlinear statistics: the mutual information and the largest

Lyapunov exponent. The null hypothesis could be rejected, but not clearly, for the stress

13

time series obtained at low constant strain rate ( ˙ǫ = 3.3 · 10−6s−1) and could not be rejected

with any test statistic for the stress time series obtained at medium constant strain rate ( ˙ǫ =

37 · 10−6s−1). For the third time series at larger constant strain rate ( ˙ǫ = 107 · 10−6s−1), the

SUDT algorithm failed to match the amplitude distribution and thus the rejection obtained

with the test statistics is questioned. Overall, the statistical testing could not establish that

the stress time series contain signiﬁcant correlations. However, this is a pilot study and a

systematic application of the test to stress time series under varying experimental conditions

is planned.

An improvement of the SUDT algorithm would be to constraint the surrogates to match

the amplitude distribution of the original time series, but there does not seem to be an

obvious way to do this. Our simulations showed that the match is maintained through the

sufﬂing of the stick–slips, but for one stress time series this failed. Also, the test may

be improved by employing other test statistics that are tailored to capture the information

relating the stick-slip states, such as correlation between the lengths of successive up-down

trends or between the magnitudes of successive turning points.

for (a). (d) The signiﬁcance S for r(τ ) in (a). (e) S for I(τ ) in (b). (f) S for λ1(m) in (c).

For (a), (b) and (c), the black thick lines denote the original data and the gray lines denote

the surrogates. For (d), (e) and (f), the level of S = 1.96 is denoted by a horizontal gray

line.

surrogates: (a) S1, (b) S2, (c) S3.

Figure 6: (a) The autocorrelation r(τ ) of the stress time series S1, S2, S3, and their 40

SUDT surrogates at the upper, middle and lower panel, respectively. (b) The mutual infor-

mation I(τ ) for the same sets of data as for (a). (c) The largest Lyapunov exponent λ1(m)

for the same sets of data as for (a). (d) The signiﬁcance S for r(τ ) in (a). (e) S for I(τ )

in (b). (f) S for λ1(m) in (c). For (a), (b) and (c), the black thick lines denote the original

data and the gray lines denote the surrogates. For (d), (e) and (f), the level of S = 1.96 is

denoted by a horizontal gray line.

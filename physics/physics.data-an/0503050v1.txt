Abstract
We present a least squares method for estimating parameters from measurements of event yields
in the presence of background and crossfeed. We adopt a uniﬁed approach to incorporating the
statistical and systematic uncertainties on the experimental measurements input to the ﬁt. We
demonstrate this method with a ﬁt for absolute hadronic D meson branching fractions, measured
in e+e− → ψ(3770) → D ¯D transitions.

INTRODUCTION

Least squares ﬁtting is a well-known and powerful method for combining information
from a set of related experimental measurements to estimate the underlying theoretical
parameters (see, for instance, Reference [1]). We discuss a speciﬁc implementation of this
method for use in high-energy physics experiments, where the free parameters, denoted by
the vector m, are extracted from event yields for signal processes. Typically, these yields
are subject to corrections for background, crossfeed, and eﬃciency. Because the sizes of
these corrections depend on the values of the free parameters, we make all yield adjustments
directly in the ﬁt. Often, the uncertainties on these corrections are ignored during the ﬁt
and are propagated to the free parameters afterwards. However, doing so could, in principle,
bias the ﬁtted central values. Therefore, we build the χ2 variable from a full description of
the uncertainties, statistical and systematic, as well as their correlations, on both the yields
and their corrections. Thus, the input measurements — event yields, signal eﬃciencies,
parameters quantifying the background processes, and background eﬃciencies — and their
uncertainties are all treated in a uniform fashion. In the χ2 minimization, we account for
the m dependence of the yield corrections.

II. FORMALISM

Below, we denote matrices by upper case bold letters and one-dimensional vectors by
lower case bold letters. Let n represent a set of N event yield measurements, each for
a diﬀerent signal process. Each measurement may receive crossfeed contributions from
other signal processes as well as backgrounds from non-signal sources. The background
processes are described by b, a vector of B estimated production yields, which can be
functions of experimentally measured quantities, such as branching fractions, cross sections,
and luminosities. In principle, the free parameters m can also appear in b. The rates at
which these background processes contaminate the signal yields are given by the N × B
background eﬃciency matrix, F. Thus, the vector s ≡ n − Fb represents the background-
subtracted yields.

We use an N ×N signal eﬃciency matrix, E, to describe simultaneously detection eﬃcien-
cies (diagonal elements) and crossfeed probabilities (oﬀ-diagonal elements). The elements
Eij are deﬁned to be the probabilities that an event of signal process j is reconstructed and
counted in yield i. The corrected yields, denoted by c, are obtained by acting on s with the
inverse of E:

c = E−1s = E−1(n − Fb).
(1)
Thus, c encapsulates all the experimental measurements. The variance matrix of c, denoted
by Vc, receives contributions, both statistical and systematic, from each element of n, b,
E, and F.

In the least squares ﬁt, we deﬁne χ2 ≡ (c −

c is the vector of
c), where
c (c −
predicted yields, which are also functions of m. Because both
c and c (through b) depend
on m, minimizing this χ2 amounts to a nonlinear version of the total least squares method [2].

Nonlinearities also occur when Vc contains multiplicative or Poisson uncertainties that
depend on the measurements. With the least squares method, these nonlinearities result in
biased estimators unless these variable uncertainties are evaluated using the predicted yields
c instead of the measured c. Therefore, all three ingredients in the χ2 — c,
c, and Vc — are
functions of m. However, we do not include the derivatives ∂Vc/∂m in D because doing so

For a simple demonstration of the aforementioned biases, we consider two yields, c1 and
c2, which are both estimators of the true yield ¯c. We assume that the uncertainties on c1

INPUT VARIANCE MATRIX

The uncertainties on the N elements of n and the B elements of b are characterized by
the N × N matrix Vn and the B × B matrix Vb, respectively. Usually, the elements of

3

E and F share many common correlated systematic uncertainties, so we construct a joint
variance matrix from the submatrices VE, VF, and CEF, where VE (N 2 × N 2) and VF
(NB × NB) are the variance matrices for the elements of E and F, respectively, and CEF
(N 2 × NB) contains the correlations between E and F. Below, we label each element of E
or F by two indices (Eij or Fij), and the two dimensions of E or F are mapped onto one
dimension of VE or VF.

The statistical and systematic uncertainties on n, b, E, and F are propagated to c to

labeled by two indices, which refer to the elements of E and F, respectively, and columns
labeled by one index, which refers to the elements of c. In other words, the ij-th row of A
is given by cT (∂E/∂Eij)T , where (∂E/∂Eij)kl = ∂Ekl/∂Eij. Therefore, the elements of A

Systematic uncertainties on the eﬃciencies are often multiplicative and belong to one
of three categories: those that depend only on the reconstructed mode (row-wise), those
that depend only on the generated mode (column-wise), and those that are uncorrelated
among elements of E and F. For row-wise eﬃciency uncertainties, all the elements in any
given row of E and F have the same fractional uncertainty, which we denote by λi ≡
σEij /Eij = σFij /Fij. The correlation coeﬃcients between elements of diﬀerent rows are
λ2
ij/(λiλj), where λij characterizes the uncertainties common to ci and cj. For instance, if
λtrack is the fractional uncertainty associated with the charged particle tracking eﬃciency,
then λi = tiλtrack and λ2
track, where ti and tj are the track multiplicities in modes i
and j, respectively. Note that λii = λi. Similarly, for column-wise uncertainties, we deﬁne
the fractional uncertainties µj ≡ σEij /Eij = σFij /Fij and correlation coeﬃcients µ2
ij/(µiµj).
We denote the uncorrelated fractional uncertainty on any element of E or F by νik,jl. Table I
gives expressions for the elements of VE, VF, and CEF, as well as their contributions to Vc
for row-wise, column-wise, and uncorrelated uncertainties.

IV. EXAMPLE: HADRONIC D MESON BRANCHING FRACTIONS

The least squares method described in the previous sections has been employed by the
CLEO-c collaboration [3] to measure absolute branching fractions for hadronic D meson
decays. Using D ¯D pairs produced through the ψ(3770) resonance, the branching fraction
for mode i, denoted by Bi, is measured by comparing the number of events where a single
D → i decay is reconstructed (called single tag, denoted by xi) with the number of events
where both D and ¯D are reconstructed via D → i and ¯D → j (called double tag, denoted
by yij). These yield measurements form the vector n. The free parameters m are the Bi and
the numbers of D0 ¯D0 and D+D− pairs produced, denoted by N 00 and N +−, respectively,
and denoted generically by N . Yields for charge conjugate modes are measured separately,
c are N Bi for single tags and N BiBj for double tags. Thus,
so the predicted corrected yields
Bi and N can be extracted from various products and ratios of xi, xj, and yij: Bi ∼ yij/xj,
N ∼ xixj/yij, up to corrections for eﬃciency, crossfeed, and background.

e

The matrix Vn describes the statistical uncertainties and correlations among the xi and
yij. The yij are uncorrelated, but because any given event can contain both single tag and
double tag candidates, the xi are correlated among themselves as well as with the yij. If
the selection criteria for single and double tags are the same, then the events (signal and
background) used to estimate yij are a proper subset of those for xi and xj. Thus, any
single tag yield is a sum of exclusive single tags (xexcl
{i,j} + yij.
Propagating the uncertainties on the independent variables xexcl
{i,j} and yij gives the following
elements for Vn:

where ∆xi ≡ xi − hxii, ∆yij ≡ yij − hyiji, and σ2
yij . Thus, for any two single
tag yields and the corresponding double tag yield, the three oﬀ-diagonal elements of Vn are
all given by the uncertainty on the number of overlapping events. If yij were not included in
the ﬁt, then xi and xj would be independent. In addition to these statistical uncertainties,
Vn can also receive contributions from additive systematic uncertainties.

Some of the sources of background we consider are non-signal D decays, e+e− → q ¯q

where Xq ¯q and Xτ +τ − are the cross sections for q ¯q and τ +τ − production, respectively, and
L is the integrated luminosity of the data sample. Because of the non-signal D decays, the
free parameter N appears in b but does not contribute any additional terms to the variance
matrix Vb, which takes the following block diagonal form:

Also, the matrix ∂b/∂m is nontrivial and is incorporated into the χ2 minimization.

In the joint variance matrix for E and F, uncertainties of all three types discussed in
Section III are present. Row-wise eﬀects arise from systematic uncertainties on simulated
S → π+π− decays, and par-
reconstruction eﬃciencies for charged tracks, π0 → γγ decays, K 0
ticle identiﬁcation (PID) for charged pions and kaons. Column-wise uncertainties reﬂect the
poorly known resonant substructure in multi-body ﬁnal states. Uncorrelated contributions
come from statistical uncertainties due to the ﬁnite Monte Carlo (MC) simulated samples
used to determine E and F. Thus, for example, if mode i is D0 → K −π+π0 and mode j is
D+ → K 0

Sπ+, then the row-wise uncertainties are given by

Because these row-wise and column-wise uncertainties are completely correlated among the
yields to which they pertain, they degrade the precision of Bi but not N . Furthermore, they
m because the relative weighting of information from
have no eﬀect on the central values of
each yield is unaltered by these uncertainties. However, they can introduce large systematic
correlations among the ﬁt parameters, even between statistically independent branching
fractions of diﬀerent charge.

A. Toy Monte Carlo Study

We test the method presented above using a toy MC simulation with Gaussian smearing
of the ﬁt inputs. We generate data for ﬁve decay modes, D0 → K −π+, D0 → K −π+π0,
D0 → K −π+π−π+, D+ → K −π+π+, and D+ → K 0
Sπ+ (charge conjugate particles are
implied), for which there are ten single tag and thirteen double tag yields. The ﬁt determines
seven free parameters: N 00, N +−, and ﬁve charge-averaged branching fractions. The input
branching fractions are taken to be the world-average values given in Reference [1], and we
use N 00 = 2.0 × 105 and N +− = 1.5 × 105. The eﬃciencies are mode-dependent: 30%–70%

for single tags and 10%–50% for double tags, with fractional statistical uncertainties of 0.5%–
1.0%. The yield uncertainties are speciﬁed to be close to the Poisson limit, and backgrounds
correspond roughly to those expected in 60 pb−1 of e+e− collisions at the ψ(3770). Also,
we apply correlated systematic eﬃciency uncertainties of 1% for tracking, 2% for π0 decays,
2% for K 0

S decays, and 1% for charged pion and kaon PID.

The ﬁt reproduces the input parameters well. Figure 1 shows the pull distributions for
the seven ﬁt parameters and the ﬁt conﬁdence level for 10000 toy MC trials. All the pull
distributions are unbiased and have widths consistent with unity. Also, the conﬁdence level
is ﬂat. Table II gives the correlation coeﬃcients among the ﬁt parameters. Branching
fractions tend to be positively correlated with each other and negatively correlated with
N 00 and N +−. In particular, the D0 branching fractions are correlated with those for D+.
In the absence of correlated eﬃciency uncertainties, the D0 and D+ free parameters would
essentially be independent.

Slight asymmetries can be observed in the pull distributions, especially in those for N 00
and N +−. These asymmetries are caused by the nonlinear nature of the multiplicative
c(m). Because the ﬁt parameters are eﬀectively
eﬃciency uncertainties and of the functions
estimated from ratios of the input yields, Gaussian ﬂuctuations in the denominators produce
non-Gaussian ﬂuctuations in the ratios, which are most visible in N 00 and N +−, where the
e
uncertainties in the denominators are dominant. Similarly, multiplicative uncertainties,
which aﬀect only the branching fractions, scale with the ﬁtted values and, therefore, give
rise to asymmetric B pulls. In both cases, larger fractional uncertainties would heighten the
asymmetries.

V. SUMMARY

We have developed a least squares ﬁt that simultaneously incorporates statistical and
systematic uncertainties, as well as their correlations, on all the input experimental mea-
surements. Biases from nonlinearities are reduced by introducing ﬁt parameter dependence
in the input variance matrix. This ﬁtting method is used to measure absolute branching
fractions of hadronic D meson decays, and toy Monte Carlo studies validate the performance
of the ﬁtter.

Abstract

Systems of a large number N of globally coupled maps have become popular as a
relatively simple prototype of high-dimensional dynamics, showing many interesting
and typical phenomena like synchronisation, cluster formation and multistability,
and having potential applications in systems like Josephson junction arrays or in
biophysical models.

There exists a wealth of numerical investigations of globally coupled maps. While
much progress has been made in the explanation of the macroscopic behaviour of
such systems in the limit N
, there is still need for a sound theory about the
asymptotic behaviour of ﬁnite-N systems as N approaches inﬁnity.

This article introduces a method by which it is possible to obtain asymptotic
estimates for long-term deviations from the thermodynamic limit behaviour. This
method is based upon the concept of quasipotentials, originally developed by Frei-
dlin, Wentzell, and others for describing the inﬂuence of small random perturbations
on the long-term behaviour of dynamical systems.

The problems of explicitly computing quasipotentials in the present context and
potential approximation schemes are discussed. All the concepts described in this
article are illustrated with a simple example.

1 Introduction

The last decades have seen a very successful development of new concepts
and methods for the investigation of low-dimensional dynamical systems. It is
obviously worth while to draw inspiration from this low dimensional experience
when studying the much more diﬃcult and much less explored ﬁeld of high and
inﬁnite dimensional dynamics, especially in the context of spatially extended
systems.

This strategy has motivated the construction of certain models of high dimen-
sional dynamical systems which are particularly well suited for an analysis in
the tradition of what has been done for low dimensional systems. One class
of such models has been termed coupled map lattices [1]. Here, time as well as
the spatial aspect of the system are discretised. The most commonly studied
coupling form in such systems is a nearest-neighbour coupling. There exists
a large number of numerical and phenomenological investigations about such
systems, and they have been very useful for studying typical eﬀects appearing
in extended systems as well as for formulating theoretical concepts appropriate
for the characterisation of such systems.

However, for certain explicit calculations it is attractive to look at a diﬀerent
form of coupling, which is not local but global, and which gives each subsys-
tem the same inﬂuence on every other subsystem [2]. Obviously, mean-ﬁeld
type approximations of models with local coupling lead to such a global cou-
pling. These approximations are usually good for long range interactions [3]
or for nearest-neighbour couplings on high-dimensional lattices [4,5], but all
spatial characteristics of the system loose their meaning since all subsystems
are treated equally independent on where they are.

On the other hand, global coupling does not only appear as an approximation;
there are many applications where one is interested in a global coupling of the
subsystems right from the beginning. Typically, this is the case in systems for
which a macroscopic (i.e. global) conserved quantity exists, which mediates the
global coupling. Prominent examples of globally coupled systems (in the form
of globally coupled diﬀerential equations) are arrays of Josephson junctions [6],
laser arrays [7], multi-mode lasers [8], certain chemical reactions [9], interacting
biological clocks [10], and models of neural activity [11].

In this paper we study the discrete-time version of globally coupled systems:
globally coupled maps.

Before formulating in the next section a more general deﬁnition of the type
of systems which we want to consider, we give a typical example: a system of
N globally coupled tent maps for the discrete time (index t) evolution of the

Here, the parameter κ has the meaning of a coupling strength, and a charac-
terises the slope of the tent.

A very rich variety of dynamical phenomena in the long term has been ob-
served in this system (or in a system of globally coupled logistic maps), caused
by the competition between a possibly chaotic local dynamics fa and the or-
dering inﬂuence of the coupling term [2,12–19]. Depending on the values of the
parameters κ and a, the system can show complete synchronisation of all sub-
systems, partial synchronisation with the formation of synchronised clusters,
or turbulent, seemingly uncorrelated movement of all subsystems. In addition,
multi-stability, often with inﬁnitely many attractors, is a common feature.

These phenomena seem to be typical for all globally coupled systems.

A technical merit of global coupling is that it is relatively easy to analyse
the thermodynamic limit N
of the time evolution of globally averaged
quantities like the mean ﬁeld

ht =

fa(x(j)

t ).

In the thermodynamic limit, the time evolution of the mean-ﬁeld can be ob-
tained from the so called nonlinear Frobenius-Perron equation [12,13,15,20,21],
an equation for probability densities ρt(x) on the subsystem state space:

This equation has to be solved self-consistently. Here, the tent map (2) brings a
special advantage: Because of the piecewise linearity of the map it is possible to

h[ρ] :=

fa(x)ρ(x) dx.

Z

approximate the densities ρt(x) by piecewise constant functions, and this leads
to a very accurate numerical procedure to follow the long-term dynamics of
equations (4) and (5), see e. g. [22,23]. While for a truly turbulent, uncorrelated
behaviour of the subsystems one would expect to ﬁnd a ﬁxed point attractor
for the dynamics of the densities, much more complicated attractors have been
observed, hinting at some nontrivial, ’hidden’ correlations in the system even
in cases without any partial synchronisation. One example for such a non-
trivial attractor is shown in Fig. 1, where ht+1 is plotted versus ht for a = 1.65
and κ = 0.27. Looking at this ﬁgure there appears to be a low-dimensional
quasiperiodic attractor of the nonlinear Frobenius Perron dynamics. (More
detailed calculations have shown that there is a ﬁne structure in the time
delay mean-ﬁeld representation which cannot be resolved in Fig. 1.)

During the last few years the nonlinear Frobenius Perron equation has been
the subject of numerous numerical and theoretical investigations [24–32].

However, the temporal behaviour of the mean-ﬁeld can be predicted correctly
by the nonlinear Frobenius Perron dynamics only in the limit N
. For
large but ﬁnite N there are clear deviations of the mean-ﬁeld from its limit
behaviour. It is worth while to study in more detail the N
asymptotics
of the long-term behaviour of the mean-ﬁeld because of the following reasons:

→ ∞

→ ∞

a) Numerical simulations of a system of globally coupled maps are bound to
use a ﬁnite number N of maps. It is important to be able to estimate how
large one has to choose N in such simulations in order to recognise the details
of the Frobenius Perron dynamics.

b) Globally coupled systems which are motivated by realistic examples consist
of a ﬁnite number of subsystems. If one wants to use for their description the
results obtained in the thermodynamic limit one has to understand in detail
how the limit situation is approached as the number of subsystems grows.

c) The nonlinear Frobenius Perron equation may produce features that are
sensitive to the system size in the sense that they cannot be observed for ﬁ-
nite N at all, while other features will still be present. In order to be able to
distinguish between sensitive and insensitive features it is crucial to under-
stand the N
asymptotics that leads to the Frobenius Perron dynamics.

→ ∞

It is easy to get a ﬁrst idea about the way in which ﬁnite N changes the picture
obtained in the thermodynamic limit by comparing Fig. 1 with the results of
some numerical simulations with ﬁnite values of N. Fig. 2 shows numerical
simulations with a decreasing number of subsystems. One can see clearly, that
the details of the attractor of the Frobenius Perron equation get washed out
more and more, the fewer subsystems are involved.

This picture resembles very much the changes in the appearance of attrac-

4

tors caused by small external random perturbations; a decreasing number of
subsystems here corresponds to an increasing noise strength there.

The idea of describing deviations from the thermodynamic limit behaviour as
stochastic perturbations is quite obvious, but it is much less easy to specify
concretely which properties these stochastic perturbations must have. Pikovsky
and Kurths [21] gave heuristic arguments based on the central limit theorem
of how to add random perturbations to the Frobenius Perron dynamics in or-
der to get a proper description of numerical simulations with ﬁnite N. While
this method works very well for special examples it lacks a solid theoretical
justiﬁcation, so that it is neither clear how widely it is applicable nor how to
improve it.

It is the aim of this article to develop an approach to understanding long-term
deviations from the thermodynamic limit in globally coupled maps based on
large deviations methods. This means that we concentrate on the rare but
very inﬂuential events that in the case of very large but ﬁnite N render the
behaviour of the coupled system perceptibly diﬀerent from what the ther-
modynamic limit predicts. The central object of this approach is a so called
quasipotential.

The notion of quasipotentials originated in the physical context from attempts
to generalise the idea of a thermodynamic potential to nonequilibrium situ-
ations (see [33] for a review). Its mathematical foundations were formulated
by Freidlin and Wentzell [34]. Quasipotentials are asymptotic estimates — on
a logarithmic scale — of invariant probability measures of stochastically per-
turbed dynamical systems with decreasing noise strength. They have proven
to be successful for characterising the stability and sensitivity of attractors
with respect to small noise, for estimating noise-induced escape times and
transition times between diﬀerent attractors, and for deriving noise scaling
laws which describe the inﬂuence of small noise on bifurcation scenarios; a
very short and incomplete list of typical applications may help the reader to
trace recent developments in this area: [35–40].

In constructing quasipotentials for the N
-asymptotics in globally cou-
pled maps, a rigorous, abstract identiﬁcation of ﬁnite-N eﬀects and random
noise is established, and the above mentioned successes in applying weak-noise
quasipotentials can hopefully be repeated for large-N quasipotentials.

→ ∞

It should be mentioned that as a starting point for studying large deviations
in globally coupled systems we do not use pure globally coupled deterministic
maps like (1) but globally coupled discrete-time Markov processes (which can
be thought of as stochastic perturbations of maps). This extension is interest-
ing for applications and advantageous from a technical point of view. It is in-
teresting to note that the corresponding ‘noisy’ version of the nonlinear Frobe-

5

nius Perron equation (touched upon in [21,13]) is the discrete-time version of
the nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation introduced by Desai and Zwanzig [41].
A quasipotential approach to ﬁnite-N deviations from the nonlinear Fokker-
Planck equation has been derived by Dawson and G¨artner [42] and is closely
related to the present approach. However, the discrete-time theory described
in this paper is clearly conceptually less complicated and easier to use for
concrete calculations.

The plan of this article is as follows: In the next section we give a deﬁnition
of exactly which type of coupled systems we want to investigate. In addition,
that section serves to introduce our notation.

Section 3 is the theoretical main part of the article. Subsection 3.1 deals with
the time-evolution in the thermodynamic limit. In subsection 3.2, deviations
from the thermodynamic limit in each single time step are studied. Subsection
3.3 shows how to obtain asymptotic estimates for long-term deviations from
the thermodynamic limit by putting together the information about the single
time steps and thereby constructing a quasipotential on a space of probability
measures. Since this ‘full’ quasipotential is a rather indigestible object, in
subsection 3.4 contracted quasipotentials are introduced as a way of extracting
information about the long-term behaviour of macroscopic variables.

Section 4 turns to the question, how large-N quasipotentials can be computed.
In particular, in subsection 4.1 a discrete-time Hamiltonian ﬁeld theory with
constraints is set up, emerging from a variational principle fulﬁlled by the
contracted quasipotentials. While it does not seem to be possible to solve the
corresponding Hamilton equations in general, one can introduce approxima-
tions that lead to an algorithm which is suitable for numerical computations of
contracted quasipotentials close to attractors of the dynamics of macroscopic
variables. In subsection 4.2 the ideas and the approximation schemes worked
out in this article are illustrated with a simple example of globally coupled
linear maps with Gaussian noise.

Finally, Section 5 sums up the statements of the paper and indicates in which
directions ongoing and planned investigations are heading.

An Appendix gives a self-contained proof of Theorem 2 (which is one of the
main ingredients of the method developed in this article). Its ﬁrst paragraphs
can serve as an introduction into the language used for probabilistic arguments
throughout this paper; more details on the relevant basic facts from probability
theory can be found in introductory texts like [43,44].

2 Systems of globally coupled noisy maps

The state of a system which consists of N coupled subsystems, each being
deﬁned on some state space M, can be characterised by an N-tuple

x[N ] := (x[N ](1), . . . , x[N ](N ))

M N ,

(6)

∈

which we call the conﬁguration of the coupled system. Often it is not necessary
to mention the index [N] explicitely in the components of x[N ], so that we
usually write x(i) instead of x[N ](i).

In this and the next section we assume that M is a compact metric space.
(However, the assumption of compactness could be weakened at the cost of a
much higher technical eﬀort in most of our considerations.) The most common

case studied in concrete examples is M = I

Coupling means generally that the subsystems do not follow an individual
time evolution, but that the state of any subsystem at a later time depends
on the states of other (and in the case of global coupling even of all) subsystems
at an earlier time. We are interested in a form of global coupling which can
be incorporated in a measure theoretic way and which is sometimes called
democratic coupling since all elements have equal inﬂuence in it.

We ﬁrst deﬁne one of the central objects of our investigation, the empirical
measure connected to a conﬁguration x[N ]:

When talking about continuity, we have to specify the topologies which we

probability measures (µn) is said to converge weakly to µ if for all bounded

The abstract form (8) of the time evolution contains the various concrete
models of globally coupled maps which have been studied in the literature:

Our introductory example (1) would correspond to

Fκ(x, µ) = fa(x) + κ˜h(µ).

(15)

Here and in the other models the local map fa depends on some parameter a
which usually changes the strength of the nonlinear character of fa.

However, the choice

Fκ(x, µ) = (1

κ)fa(x) + κ˜h(µ)

−

(16)

used by Kaneko [2] has the advantage that there is a built-in guarantee that
the right hand side is in M as long as κ is in the interval [0, 1].

The coupling can act through the parameter a, too, like in

Fκ(x, µ) = fa0+κ ˜m(µ)(x),

(17)

which has been studied by Pikovsky and Kurths [21].

As already explained in the introduction, in this article we study coupled
systems with a stochastic time evolution, for which the deterministic behaviour
of eq. (8) is a limit case. What we call a system of globally coupled noisy maps

The last step which completes the proof of Theorem 1 concerns the fact that
the exceptional null-sets on which the above convergence does not hold true
may depend on the function g. But standard topological arguments can be
used to exclude the possibility that all the diﬀerent null-sets — for all bounded
continuous functions g — do not add up to a set of positive measure, so that
the conditional probability for the weak convergence (22) is 1, indeed.

In the case of globally coupled maps without noise, i. e. Qx = δx, eq. (23) re-
duces to the nonlinear Frobenius Perron equation mentioned in the Introduc-
tion, which has been introduced by Kaneko [13] and by Pikovski and Kurths
[21].

Many — mostly numerical — studies of the nonlinear Frobenius Perron equa-
tion and its noisy counterpart show that the map
often has a very compli-
cated attractor structure [21,13,14,22,23]. Periodic, quasiperiodic, and chaotic
attractors of the dynamics (23) have been found and discussed in connec-
tion with some counterintuitive observations about the temporal behaviour of
macroscopic variables. Also, multi-stability with the simultaneous existence of
many (possibly inﬁnitely many) attractors is possible.

F

Not surprisingly it is the nonlinearity of (23) which opens up the possibility
of a much richer dynamical behaviour than what is known from the linear
Frobenius Perron equation and its noisy counterpart (which is the limiting

case of (23) in which F (x, ϕ) depends on x only — and not on ϕ (uncoupled
case)).

3.2 Large deviations from the deterministic dynamics of empirical measures

namic limit deterministically by the map
. By deﬁnition, for large but ﬁnite
N the temporal evolution of (

In the Introduction we gave an example of how the behaviour of a macroscopic
variable for a large ﬁnite system looks like a stochastically perturbed version
of its behaviour in the thermodynamic limit. Here, we trace this observation
back to the level of empirical measures: The behaviour of

plus random perturbations with a strength

N . These random perturbations have the so called large
deviation property, which is essential for the methods we will apply to study
their inﬂuence.

First we recall what it means to say that probability measures have the large
deviation property [46,47].

Consider a family of probability measures (P [ε]) on some compact metric space
. This family is said to have the large deviation property with deviation rate

I, which is a function I :

the following limit holds:

(26)

To be precise, this property is called the Laplace principle [47] because of
its obvious relation to the Laplace approximation (i.e. the “saddle point ap-
proximation” for real valued integrals), but (at least in our setting) this is
equivalent to the large deviation property in its original formulation.

It is convenient and helpful for intuition to introduce the following symbolic

13

notation for the essence of (26):

P [ε]( ds)

(27)

Thus, the large deviation property can be characterised as a tool for estimating
the probability of rare events: Roughly speaking, the sets A
which do not
contain points where the deviation rate is vanishing, have a probability that
converges to zero exponentially fast as ε
0, and the quantity inf s∈A I(s)
gives the exponential rate of this convergence.

generalised Sanov theorem proved by Dawson and G¨artner [42]. However,
we will sketch a direct proof of Theorem 2, which requires less topological
prerequisites than the approach of Dawson and G¨artner, in the Appendix.

where in the last transformation we used equation (32). This completes the
proof of Theorem 3.

If we are able to ﬁnd the quasipotential, i.e. the deviation rate for invariant
measures of the process of empirical measures then we have all we need to know
for exponential estimates of the long term behaviour of empirical measures and
thereby of the long term behaviour of all global variables. We will come back
to this point in the next subsection.

Theorem 3 gives the key information how to ﬁnd quasipotentials: Equation
(33) is an eigenvalue equation in a generalised sense, and there exists a com-
plete theory about how to ﬁnd solutions to such equations. A very brief sum-
mary of the relevant facts from that theory [49,50] will be given below.

The concept of a quasipotential for an asymptotic description of the long term
behaviour of stochastic perturbations of dynamical systems was introduced
(under various names) by several authors in the context of low-dimensional
diﬀusion processes with a small noise term. Early work on quasipotentials pub-
lished in the physics literature was inspired by an analogy with semiclassical
approximation in the path integral formalism of quantum mechanics, and by
the fact that in the weak noise limit the Fokker-Planck equation can be linked
to a Hamilton-Jacobi equation; for references see [33]. A rigorous mathematical
formulation of the quasipotential method for these continuous-time situations
was given by Wentzell and Freidlin [34]. Later, a version of the quasipotential
method for the discrete-time systems was formulated [51,52], and this is what
we need here.

The usual Wentzell-Freidlin approach to quasipotentials does not start from
the assumption that there is a family of invariant measures with the large
deviation property (like Theorem 3) but rather shows its existence. However,
the conditions used in the arguments of references [51,52] are not strictly
fulﬁlled in the present case. Instead of going into the details of these arguments
again with an adjusted set of preconditions, we pragmatically content ourselves
here with showing how to ﬁnd a quasipotential if it exists, which can be done
by studying the algebraic consequences of Theorem 3 . The proofs of the

following statements can be found in [49]

The name action for a sum of one-step deviation rates like in (36) alludes to
the formal analogy to semi-classics and hints at the methods which we will
apply for the calculations in the next section.

Least actions are the crucial elements in the construction of solutions of equa-
tion (33):

Every solution of (33) can be written in the following form:

[S(ϕ

α) + c(α)] ,

(38)

where the coeﬃcients c(α) are free parameters, if one is only interested in solv-
ing (33). But since the quasipotential is the deviation rate for the invariant
measures, the coeﬃcients have to fulﬁl some additional equations that guar-
antee compatibility with (32), and these equations ﬁx the values c(α) up to an
additive constant which can be set to zero. A graph theoretical method of how
to determine the values c(α) when the least actions V (ψ
α) are known for all

F goes back to Wentzell and Freidlin [34]. We will not explain the details
of this procedure, for which we refer to [34,51,52], as in a general context it
is enough to know that the coeﬃcients can be determined in principle, while

3.4 Large deviations from the deterministic dynamics of global variables in

the long term

The quasipotential Φ describes the long term behaviour of empirical measures
as N approaches inﬁnity, or more precisely the probability for ﬁnding cer-
tain empirical measures in the long time development of the system. From
a practical point of view, however, it is cumbersome to observe probability
(M) in large coupled sys-
distributions on the inﬁnite dimensional space
tems. Instead, it is usually more convenient to follow the time development of
(low dimensional) global variables, i.e. variables that depend on the empirical
measure through a continuous map

P

G :

(M)

P

→

Rk.

G describes the long term behaviour

The fact that (W [N ]) has the large deviation property implies a large devia-
tion property for (W [N ]
G ), too, and the deviation rate can be found through
a theorem which is known as contraction principle in large deviation theory
[46,47]:

Theorem 4 The deviation rate of the family (W [N ]
G ) of probability measures
describing the long term statistics of the global variable G, which we call
contracted quasipotential φG, can be derived in the following way from the
quasipotential Φ:

φG(u) =

inf
ψ∈P(M ):G(ψ)=u

[Φ(ψ)]

(42)

19

for all u

G(

The proof of this theorem consists in the simple observation that the large
deviation property (26) for (W [N ]) implies that for all bounded continuous
functions hG : G(

and this shows that the statement of Theorem 4 is true.

For ﬁnite N, however, the points in the time delay plot will be distributed
according to a probability measure W [N ]
R. Again, the measures (W [N ]
G,2)
have the large deviation property, and it follows from Theorem 2, Theorem

G,2 on R

3, and equation (26) that the corresponding deviation rate, the time delay
contracted quasipotential φG,2, can be calculated from the quasipotential Φ in
the following way:

φG,2(u, v) =

inf
G(ϕ)=u,G(ψ)=v

[Φ(ϕ) + H(ψ

(45)

|F

This time delay contracted quasipotential predicts the outcome of time delay
plots for large but ﬁnite N. Its minimum or minima coincide with the set (44),
and its level cuts (contour lines) in heights proportional to 1/N determine the
regions of the plane in which points of the time delay plot are to be expected
when N is ﬁnite.

In the example of Fig. 1 , the time delay contracted quasipotential is expected
to have a ring-shaped valley along the thermodynamic limit attractor and a
hill in the middle of that ring, the height of which is proportional to the critical
number of subsystems which is necessary in order to resolve the ring structure
in a simulation.

4 Approximative computation of contracted quasipotentials

In the preceding section we have built the theoretical fundament for a large
deviation type description of the N
asymptotics for the long term be-
→ ∞
haviour of globally coupled maps. The central object in this description is the
quasipotential; however, its computation is a complex and diﬃcult minimi-
sation problem over paths (i.e., sequences) in the inﬁnite dimensional space
(M) of probability measures. This is a much more diﬃcult task than the min-
P
imisation problem that one has to solve in order to compute quasipotentials
for low dimensional maps. Nevertheless, a Hamiltonian approach to the min-
imisation problem, which has proved to be successful in the low-dimensional
context, can be useful for the present situation, too. However, in order to reach
at practical algorithms we do not simply copy the low dimensional procedure
to treat the too complicated inﬁnite-dimensional problem of computing Φ(ϕ),
but we describe a way to approximate computations of contracted quasipo-
tentials φG(u), which are deﬁned on a low-dimensional space.

4.1 A Hamiltonian formalism for minimising actions

has only one attractor and that
For the following we assume that the map
χ0 is a point of this attractor. This simpliﬁes the notation, and the general
case of more than one attractor is complicated only by the fact that several

F

21

pieces of ‘local’ quasipotentials have to be stitched together like in equation
(38).

We concentrate now on the problem how to compute the contracted quasipo-
tential φG for a global variable G. According to equations (42), (39), (37), and
(36) we have the following multiple minimisation problem:

φG(u) = inf

It will turn out to be useful to introduce in an intermediate step constraints
not only to the value of the global variable in the last state χn but in all steps
Rk the constrained

The advantage of the introduction of constrained n
actions is that the min-
imisation problem of equation (48) looks very much like the problem of de-
termining the quasipotentials of a low-dimensional (i.e., k
dimensional) map,
the only diﬀerence being that the n
action of a low-dimensional map has been
replaced by a constrained n
action derived from an inﬁnite dimensional map.

This shows that the main new technical problem which we face is the compu-
tation of constrained n
actions (47), while the step (48) can then be solved
by standard methods.

−

Equation (47) which deﬁnes the constrained n
actions can be reformulated
as a Lagrangian minimisation problem; we do this here under the assumption
that M is a compact interval in R and that the probability measure χ0 is
absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure on M so that χ0
has a probability density ρ0.

In order to ﬁnd a minimising sequence of densities ρ1, . . . , ρn that solves
the minimisation problem (49) one could start to write down the variational
derivatives
δρi(y) of the sum in (49) which have to be equal to zero for the min-
imising sequence. In this way one would be led to an implicit relation between
ρj+1, ρj, and ρj−1, which is a discrete-time version of a Lagrange equation.
However, this relation cannot simply be turned into an explicit iterative rule
how to proceed from ρj−1 and ρj to ρj+1 in a minimising sequence.

The situation is easier to analyse in a Hamiltonian formulation which can
be derived from the Lagrangian one if the global variable has the following
structure

G[ρ] =

γ(x)ρ(x) dx,

(53)

i.e., if it is obtained by averaging some integrable function γ(x). This is the
case for the examples: mean value (12) with γ(x) = x, and mean ﬁeld (14)
with γ(x) = f (x).

By Legendre transforming (50) one arrives at the Hamiltonian

and that equations (61), (62), and (63) in equation (59) lead to an expres-

This remark shows that the present formalism can be interpreted as a gener-
alisation of the classic Cram´er’s theorem which says that the deviation rate
of the probability laws of mean values of independent identically distributed
random variables is the Legendre transform of the logarithmic moment gen-
erating function of those random variables. However, on the level of practical
calculations, expression (64) does not oﬀer any additional help.

For any more explicit progress in evaluating the constrained n-action (47) it is
Zπj+1(ρj, µ)
necessary to resort to some approximations. First of all we expand
in powers of µ. Retaining only terms up to second order in µ, we are led to
approximate expressions for λj+1 and µj+1. With the abbreviations

At this point it is useful to look back to equation (57) and to note that there
are two ways in which ρj+1 deviates from
[ρj]: If the exponential factor on
the right hand side of the equation would not contain an x-dependent πj+1(x)
part, ρj+1 would be among all densities with the prescribed value uj+1 for the
global variable G that one which has smallest relative entropy with respect
[ρj]. The additional eﬀect of πj+1(x) is to allow for the fact that for
to
minimising the total n-step action it is usually advantageous not to try to
[ρj]) in all the single steps but to look
minimise the one-step actions H(ρj+1|F
at the overall eﬀect of the choice of ρj+1 on the total n-step action.

F

F

However, it is the non-trivial inﬂuence of πj+1(x) that makes it so diﬃcult
to ﬁnd a minimising sequence which fulﬁls equations (57) and (58). The sit-
uation becomes much simpler if we neglect the inﬂuence of πj+1(x) by just
concentrating on eq. (57) and setting

πj(x)

1 for all j

≡

(72)

in this equation. This is expected to lead to a reasonable approximation of the
contracted quasipotential in the vicinity of the attractor in the dynamics of

26

the global variable G, since in this case a minimising sequence of densities ρj
should stay close to the attractor so that there is not much scope for reducing
the action by changing the sequence through the inﬂuence of πj. In any case,
the approximate contracted quasipotential computed with the assumption (72)
is an upper bound for the true contracted quasipotential.

With (72) we obtain from equations (65) — (67):

We have written this equation in a form which resembles the well studied sit-

system with white Gaussian noise (xt+1 = F (xt) + ξ) [53,52]. In that case, a
quasipotential Φ(x) which describes the asymptotic behaviour of the system’s

where in the sum on the right hand side q0 is a point of the attractor of F ,
and qn = x.

Despite this similarity, there is a crucial diﬀerence between equation (77) and
equation (78): The points u′
j which appear in equation (77) are not simply
images of the points uj under some low dimensional map F . Instead, in order
to calculate u′
j one has to know the full density ρj. Therefore it is not enough

27

to look only at the sequence of points (uj) but one has to follow the sequence
of densities (ρj), which, however, is determined by equation (57) with (72).
Unfortunately this means that in order to evaluate (77) one cannot simply
use the known algorithms for computing quasipotentials according to (78).
Nevertheless, solving equation (77) is much easier than solving the original
problem (46), since the minimisation now requires only variation of a sequence
of points instead of variation of a sequence of densities.

With equation (77) we have found a generally applicable procedure how to
compute an upper bound for contracted quasipotentials which can serve as a
good estimate for the exact contracted quasipotential near attractors.

4.2 A simple example

In this subsection we study a very simple model system of globally coupled
noisy maps. The purpose of this example is, on the one hand, to illustrate the
deﬁnitions and computational procedures that were introduced in this article,
and, on the other hand, to serve as a test for the quality of the approximation
formula (77).

The model system consists simply of linear maps on R:

fa(x) = ax,

1 < a < 1,

−

(79)

to which white Gaussian noise with a standard deviation σ is added, and which
R of their mean ﬁeld (where κ is a
are coupled through a function kκ : R
→
R); this means that equation (8)
coupling strength and k0(h) = 0 for all h
has to be applied with the function

∈

Fκ(x, µ) = fa(x) + kκ(˜h(µ)) = ax + kκ(˜h(µ))

(80)

(cf. (14)), and equation (23) becomes:

[ρ](y) =

F

1
√2πσ ZR

e− 1

2σ2 (y−ax−kκ(˜h[ρ]))2

ρ(x) dx.

(81)

The subsystem state space of this example is R rather than a compact space —
in contrast to an assumption that was used for the derivations in the previous
sections; the reason for choosing such a system is the simplicity of calculations
which serves the purpose of illustrating the various steps in the construction
of quasipotentials. Therefore we do not bother here to give proofs for the
non-compact case. In practise it is not diﬃcult (for suﬃciently small coupling

28

(82)

(83)

(84)
(85)

(86)

strength) to modify the system in a way that the subsystems are restricted
to a closed interval by cutting of the noise whenever a subsystem would leave
that interval. Such a modiﬁcation does not change the asymptotic behaviour
and therefore it is convenient to use the original system for calculations.

We denote a Gaussian probability density with mean value m and variance v
by

Now it is an important observation that Gaussian densities stay Gaussian
under the inﬂuence of the temporal evolution (81). In fact, we have

Nm,v(y) :=

1

If m∗ is any point of an attractor of (84), the density

nonlinear couplings there may be diﬀerent attractors of (84).

Nm∗,v∗ is a point of an
. For a linear coupling, kκ(h) = κh, one has m∗ = 0, but for

F

We now want to ﬁnd the contracted quasipotential φ ˜m for the global variable
˜m, the mean value, i. e. γ(x) = x in equation (53). Starting from the density
Nm∗,v∗, one has to look for a minimising sequence of densities ρj according
ρ0 =
to equation (57) and fulﬁlling the constraints (52) for a given sequence of mean
values (uj).

If we use the simpliﬁcation (72), the minimising sequence turns out to be the
Nuj,v∗. Then, the approximation (77) for the
sequence of Gaussian densities
contracted quasipotential reads like this:

This means that in this case the approximate contracted quasipotential is
— up to the constant factor 1
v∗ — equal to the quasipotential of the one-
dimensional map m
am + kκ(am) with Gaussian random perturbations,
which can be calculated using the well established methods of [53] and [52].

This result can be checked through numerical simulations of the system of
coupled maps (8) with (80): The data of a long time simulation of the N
subsystem can be used for plotting a histogram ˆw ˜m(m) of the distribution
1
N log ˆw ˜m(m) should converge
of mean values, and Theorem 4 tells us that
−
to the contracted quasipotential as N
. Typically, one expects that al-
→ ∞
1
ready for large ﬁnite N the histogram
N log ˆw ˜m(m) shows the shape of the
−
quasipotential, shifted by an additive oﬀset due to the pre-factor hidden in
asymptotic relations like (27), which is only weakly dependent on m.

Fig. 3 compares the approximation (88) for the contracted quasipotential with
histograms obtained in simulations. Part a) shows the case κ = 0, a = 0 of
uncoupled identically distributed random variables, where the result φ ˜m(m) =
1
2σ2 m2 is not only a special case of our approximation (88) but a necessary
consequence of the central limit theorem. The histogram contains the results
of simulations with N = 105 and σ = 1, and its shape ﬁts very well with the
shifted contracted quasipotential, which is the solid line parabola in the ﬁgure.

Part b) is for the less trivial case κ = 0.4, a = 0.5. Here and in all the following
examples we use again σ = 1. The lower half of the ﬁgure shows a histogram
for a simulation with N = 105, the upper half with N = 106. While the
parabolic contracted quasipotential (88) gives a reasonable approximation to
the histogram for N = 105, it obviously works better for N = 106.

Looking at nonlinear coupling functions kκ(h) one can study more complicated
mean ﬁeld dynamics. With the choice

kκ(h) = 10κ(1

(89)

with some nonlinearity parameter α one has for κ = 0.1 the following mean

ﬁeld map: m
lution of the mean ﬁeld can show all the dynamical behaviours that are known

for the logistic map. The approximation (87) for the contracted quasipoten-
tial is the conventional quasipotential for the logistic map, which cannot be
written down explicitely but can be solved numerically with high precision.

Fig. 4 shows the results for this nonlinearly coupled system of noisy linear
maps with a = 0.5, κ = 0.1 and α = 3.16. For this set of parameters the mean
ﬁeld map has a stable period 2. Part a) of the ﬁgure shows the approximative
contracted quasipotential φ ˜m(m) with its two minima. Part b) contains two
N log ˆw ˜m(m), the lower one with N = 105 and the upper
histograms for
one with N = 106. Part c) and d) show enlargements of these histograms in
the neighbourhood of the left and right minimum, respectively, together with
shifted portions of the contracted quasipotential (as solid lines) in order to
demonstrate that again the approximate contracted quasipotentials correctly
predict the shape of the histograms within the numerical accuracy.

As a ﬁnal example we look at the system with a = 0.5, κ = 0.1 and α = 7.92.
In this case the mean ﬁeld map is chaotic on an interval. We use this case
as an example of how to apply time delay contracted quasipotentials (45).
Fig. 5 a) shows the result of a simulation of this system with N = 3000 in
the form of a time delay plot. The time delay contracted quasipotential in
Fig. 5 b), which again has been obtained with the approximation (72), allows
predictions about the blurring eﬀect of ﬁnite N in numerical simulations of
such systems.

5 Conclusion and outlook

The aim of this article was to develop a method for describing large deviations
from the thermodynamic limit of systems of globally coupled noisy maps after
the model of the quasipotential method for stochastically perturbed dynamical
systems.

On an abstract level this has been achieved by interpreting the time evolution
in the thermodynamic limit as a consequence of a deterministic dynamical
system on a space of probability measures (Theorem 1) and by recognising
that the deviations from this thermodynamic limit behaviour in one time step
follow a statistical distribution which allows exponential asymptotic estimates
for large deviations (Theorem 2). These are the two ingredients necessary for
constructing abstract quasipotentials on the space of probability measures
(Theorem 3).

These abstract quasipotentials contain the full information about large devia-
tions from the thermodynamic limit in the long term. However, being deﬁned
on an inﬁnite dimensional space of probability measures, they are rather in-

31

accessible through concrete calculations and ill-suited for directly interpreting
the observed long-term distribution of macroscopic quantities in large ﬁnite
systems.

Therefore, the concept of contracted quasipotentials has been introduced (The-
orem 4 and equation (45)) in order to extract from the abstract quasipotential
information about concrete and observable characteristics of the temporal evo-
lution of macroscopic quantities.

The Hamiltonian approach discussed in Section 4 makes it clear how diﬃcult
it is to solve the variational problem behind the quasipotentials . On the
other hand it opens the way for approximations which turn the problem into
a manageable one. In particular, the approximation (77) is appropriate in the
vicinity of attractors of the macroscopic dynamics.

The simple example with linearly and nonlinearly coupled linear maps shows
that this approximation gives a correct description of the probability of rare
deviations from the thermodynamic limit close to an attractor. An investiga-
tion of the much more interesting situation of coupled nonlinear maps like the
tent map or the logistic map, which requires the implementation of a new nu-
merical scheme, is in progress and is expected to lead to a correct description
of the blurring eﬀect of ﬁnite system size on the attractors of the macroscopic
dynamics in such systems. In addition, this approach will oﬀer a new answer
to the question under which circumstances the invariant density, which is a
ﬁxed point of the nonlinear Frobenius-Perron equation, can loose stability. It
will be interesting to compare this new criterion to the various statements
obtained by linear stability analysis of the Frobenius Perron dynamics, which
depend on which norm is used for measuring the smallness of perturbations
[25–27,29,30,22,31,32].

However, as the approximation (77) is limited to the vicinity of attractors,
it is desirable to go beyond the approximation (72) of equation (58) so that
it is possible to calculate global features of quasipotentials like quasipotential
barriers between diﬀerent attractors. This is probably not possible for the
general case, but for special choices of
there is some hope of being able to
simplify equation (58) — for instance if the maps Fκ(x, µ) are piecewise linear
in x and the noise inﬂuence in

is weak (i. e., if Qx is close to δx).

F

F

In view of this problematic situation with the evaluation of quasipotentials
it is consoling, that there is a class of systems for which the computation of
quasipotentials for ﬁnite-N eﬀects in globally coupled systems is not more
diﬃcult than the computation of quasipotentials for weak noise eﬀects in low-
dimensional dynamical systems. This class of systems consists of coupled sub-
systems which are deﬁned on a ﬁnite state space M. More concretely, if M con-
sists of m elements, empirical measures can be written as (m
1)-dimensional

−

32

−

deﬁnes a (m

1)-dimensional dynamical system, and the
vectors, so that
F
quasipotential Φ is deﬁned on a (m
1)-dimensional space. While such sys-
−
tems with a ﬁnite discrete subsystem space are not directly motivated by
realistic physical systems, they can be studied as conceptually simplest proto-
types for globally coupled noisy systems that show non-trivial eﬀects such as
noise induced phase transitions when N is ﬁnite, which can be analysed using
quasipotentials. Results in this direction will be published elsewhere [54].

A Appendix

This Appendix gives details of a proof of Theorem 2. The reader who is not
familiar with the mathematics literature on large deviations will ﬁnd this the-
orem less intuitive than most other statements in this article, and therefore
— instead of referring to related results in [42] — we will try to use a fairly
self-contained line of arguments here, following the proof of Sanov’s theorem
in [47], but without making explicit use of stochastic control theory.

In the light of [49] this can be called a stochastic possibilistic dynamics. If
we start from V [N |ψ]

Unfortunately this requires more work than (A.14), and we have to use some
non-trivial but standard results from probability theory which can be found
in introductory texts like [43,44].

First of all we observe that the convexity of H allows us to use Jensen’s
inequality in (A.13), so that

probability 1, it is suﬃcient to know that there is a countable dense subset
of the space of bounded, uniformly continuous functions (with regard to an

appropriate metric), but this follows from a standard separability result, see
for instance Corollary 11.2.5 in [43].

Combining these convergence results with the continuity of h and the lower
semicontinuity of H we know now that almost surely

This is nearly the statement (A.16) except that it refers not to the whole se-
quence VN but to a subsubsequence V(k). However, it has been shown that every
subsequence of VN has such a subsubsequence. Now assume that eq. (A.16)
were not true. Then for suﬃciently small ǫ > 0 there would be an inﬁnite
sequence of VNi smaller than inf ϕ∈P(M ) [H(ϕ
ǫ, and this sub-
sequence would not have a subsubsequence which fulﬁls eq. (A.23). This con-
tradiction shows that (A.16) must be true, and the proof of Theorem 2 is
complete.

Fig. 1: Time delay plot of the mean ﬁeld ht+1 = h[ρt+1] versus ht = h[ρt] as
obtained by numerically solving the nonlinear Frobenius-Perron equation
(4) for coupled tent maps (2) with a = 1.65 and κ = 0.27.

Fig. 2: Time delay plot of the mean ﬁeld ht+1 versus ht for the same pa-
rameters as Fig. 1, but this time obtained by iterating equation (1) and
using equation (3) for ﬁnite systems with decreasing size: a) N = 106, b)
N = 105, c) N = 104. In each case the plots show 2000 points after initial
transients have died out.

Fig. 3: The contracted quasipotential φ ˜m(m) of the system (80), (81) with
linear coupling, compared to histogramms of the invariant density ˆw ˜m(m)
obtained from numerical simulations: a) with parameters κ = 0, a = 0,
σ = 1, N = 105 over 10000 time steps, b) with parameters κ = 0.4, a = 0.5,
σ = 1, and with N = 105 (lower part) and N = 106 over 10000 time steps. In
all cases the logarithmically plotted histogramms can be approximated by
the contracted quasipotential (solid line) after a vertical shift by a constant
oﬀset.

Fig. 4: Comparison of invariant density and contracted quasipotential for the
system (80), (81) with nonlinear coupling (89). The parameters are κ = 0.1,
a = 0.5, and α = 3.16; in this case, the nonlinear Frobenius-Perron dy-
namics predicts a period-2-attractor for the mean value. The various parts
show a) the contracted quasipotential φ ˜m(m), b) a logarithmic plot of the
histogramm for the invariant density ˆw ˜m(m) from a simulation of 10000
time steps with N = 105 (lower histogramm) and N = 106 (upper his-
togramm). Parts c) and d) enlarge the vicinity of the left periodic point
and the right periodic point, respectively, to show the agreement between
the histogramms and the shifted contracted quasipotials (solid lines).

Fig. 5: a) Time delay map, mt+1 versus mt for the system (80), (80) with
nonlinear coupling (89) and parameters κ = 0.1, a = 0.5, and α = 7.92,
obtained from a simulation with N = 3000 over 10000 time steps. b) Time
delay contracted quasipotential φ ˜m,2(m, m′). The contour lines for the levels
of 0.002, 0.004, and 0.006 in the quasipotential follow the shape of the
blurred attractor in a).

sis. Based on numerical results, the scaling range of TEPIX returns
is speciﬁed, long memory eﬀect or long range correlation property in
this market is investigated, characteristic exponent for probability dis-
tribution function of TEPIX returns is derived and ﬁnally the stage of
development in Tehran Stock Exchange is determined.

Introduction

Financial markets have in recent years been at the focus of physicists’s at-
tempts to apply existing knowledge from statistical mechanics to economic
problems . These markets, though largely varying in details of trading rules
and traded goods, are characterized by some generic features of their ﬁnan-
cial time series, called stylized facts. Multifractal processes and the deeply
connected mathematics of large deviations and multiplicative cascades have
been used in many contexts to account for the time scale dependence of the
statistical properties. For example, recent empirical ﬁndings [1, 2, 3] suggest
that in rough surfaces, this framework is likely to be pertinent. The aim is

to characterize the statistical properties of the series with the hope that a
better understanding of the underlying stochastic dynamics could provide
useful information to create new models able to reproduce experimental
facts. An important aspect concerns concepts as scaling and the scale in-
variance of height surface [3, 4]. There is an important volume of data and
studies showing self-similarity at short space scales and an apparent break-
down for longer spaces modeled in terms of distributions with truncated
tails. Recent studies have shown that the traditional approach based on a
Brownian motion picture [5, 6] or other more elaborated descriptions such
as L´evy and truncated L´evy distributions [2], all of them relying on the idea
of additive process, are not suitable to properly describe the statistical fea-
tures of these ﬂuctuations. In this sense, there are more and more evidences
that a multiplicative process approach is the correct way to proceed, and
this line of thought leads in a natural way to multifractality. In fact, this
idea was already suggested some years ago when intermittency phenomena
in return ﬂuctuations was observed at diﬀerent length scales which gave
rise to some eﬀorts to establish a link with other areas of physics such as
turbulence [7, 8]. Nowadays, we know that there are important diﬀerences
between both systems, as for instance the spectrum of frequencies, but the
comparison triggered an intense analysis of the existing data. Multifractal
analysis of a set of data can be performed in two diﬀerent ways, analyzing
either the statistics or the geometry. A statistical approach consists of deny-
ing an appropriate intensive variable depending on a resolution parameter,
then its statistical moments are calculated by averaging over an ensemble of
realizations and at random base points. It is said that the variable is mul-
tifractal if those moments exhibit a power-law dependence in the resolution
parameter [9, 10]. On the other hand, geometrical approaches try to assess
a local power-law dependency on the resolution parameter for the same in-
tensive variables at every particular point (which is a stronger statement
that just requiring some averagesthe momentsto follow a power law). While
the geometrical approach is informative about the spatial localization of self-
similar (fractal) structures, it has been much less used because of the greater
technical diﬃculty to retrieve the correct scaling exponents. However, in the
latest years an important eﬀort to improve geometrical techniques has been
carried out, giving sensible improvement and good performance [11, 12]. We
will apply the geometrical approach in this paper as a valuable tool for the
understanding of the price return ﬂuctuations.
The main objective of this article is to investigate the characteristics of
Tehran Stock Exchange using some multifractal measures. Our purpose is
to show how some relatively simple statistics gives us indications on the mar-
ket situation. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe
our data. In Section 3, we review the rescaled range (R/S) analysis and it’s
modiﬁed version, Lo’s R/S analysis. The way of interpretation and empir-
ical results for classical R/S analysis and Lo’s R/S analysis are presented.

acteristic exponent for a probability distribution and its relation to Hurst
exponent is reviewed. Moreover, characteristic exponent of TEPIX returns
distribution is computed. Then, in Section 7, a simple explanation of long
memory process is mentioned and shown how we can use Lo’s R/S analysis
to ﬁnd out presence of such process. The market stage of development and
its relation to generalized Hurst exponent is studied in Section 8. Finally,
conclusions are given in Section 9.

2 Data Description

We analyze the values of the TEPIX for the period of almost 9 years: from
20th may 1995 to 18th march 2004. Before 1995 the Tehran Price Index was
rather ﬁxed because of government controls. The data have been recorded at
each trading day. So that our database consists of 2342 values and 2341 daily
returns. The sources of this data is the center of research and development
of Iran capital market and the paper utilizes only the closing prices. In Fig.1
we present a time series corresponding to daily values of the TEPIX index.
It must be mentioned that TEPIX tracks the performance of more than 350
listed local ﬁrms.

turns does not look like a Gaussian distribution and belongs to stable L´evy
distributions.

3 Rescaled Range (R/S) analysis

3.1 Classical R/S Analysis

The Hurst rescaled range (R/S) analysis is a technique proposed by Henry
Hurst in 1951 [13] to test presence of correlations in empirical time series.
The main idea behind the R/S analysis is that one looks at the scaling
behavior of the rescaled cumulative deviations from the mean, or the dis-
tance the system travels as a function of time. This is compared to the
null-hypothesis of a random walk. For an independent system, the distance

covered increases, on average, by the square root of time.
covers a larger distance than this, it cannot be independent by deﬁnition,
and the changes must be inﬂuencing each other; they have to be corre-
lated. Although there may be autoregressive process present that can cause
short-term correlations, we will see that when adjusting for such short-term
correlations, there may be other forms of memory eﬀects present which need
to be examined.
Consider a time series in prices of length P . This time series is then trans-
formed into a time series of logarithmic returns of length N = P
1 such
that

i = 1, 2, ..., P

−

Time period is divided into m contiguous sub-periods of length n, such that
m
n = N . Each sub-period is labelled by Ia, with a = 1, 2, ...m. Then,
each element in Ia is labelled by Nk, a such that k = 1, 2, ..., n. For each
sub-period Ia of length n the average is calculated as

∗

Ma =

Thus, Ma is the mean value of the N ′
is contained in the sub-period Ia of
length n. Then, we calculate the time series of accumulated departures from
the mean (Xk, a) for each sub-period Ia, deﬁned as

Xk, a =

(Ni, a −

Ma),

k

Xi=1

k = 1, 2, ...n.

(3)

As can be seen from Eq. (3), the series of accumulated departures from the
mean always will end up with zero. Now, the range that the time series
covers relative to the mean within each sub-period is deﬁned as

RIa = max(Xk, a)

min(Xk, a),

1 < k < n.

(4)

−

The next step is to calculate the standard deviation for each sub-period Ia,

Then, the range for each sub-period (RIa) is rescaled by the corresponding
standard deviation (SIa). Recall that we had m contiguous sub-periods of
length n. Thus, the average R/S value for length or box n is

Now, the calculations from Eqs. (1)-(6) must be repeated for diﬀerent time
horizons. This is achieved by successively increasing n and repeating the
calculations until we have covered all integer ns. One can say that R/S
analysis is a special form of box-counting for time series. However, the
method was developed long before the concepts of fractals. After having
calculated R/S values for a large range of diﬀerent time horizons n, we plot
log(R/S)n against log(n). By performing a least-squares regression with
log(R/S)n as the dependent variable and log(n) as the independent one, we
ﬁnd the slope of the regression which is the estimate of the Hurst exponent
H. The Hurst exponent (H) and the fractal dimension Df are related as
[14]

Df = 2

H.

In theory, H = 0.5 means that the time series is independent, but as men-
tioned above the process need not be Gaussian.
If H = 0.5, the process
may in fact be a non-Gaussian process as e.g. the Student-t or gama. If
(0.5, 1.0] it implies that the time series is persistent which is charac-

price changes are correlated with future daily price changes; all weekly price

changes are correlated with all future weekly price changes and so on. This
is one of the key characteristics of fractal time series.
It is also a main
characteristic of non-linear dynamical systems that there is a sensitivity to
initial conditions which implies that such a system in theory would have an
inﬁnite memory. The persistence implies that if the series has been up or
down in the last period then the chances are that it will continue to be up
or down, respectively, in the next period. This behavior is also independent
of the time scale we are looking at. The strength of the trend-reinforcing
behavior, or persistence, increases as H approaches 1.0. This impact of the
present on the future can be expressed as a correlation function (C),

C = 2(2H−1)

1.

(8)

In the case of H = 0.5 the correlation C equals zero, and the time series
is uncorrelated. However, if H = 1.0 we see that C = 1, indicating perfect

positive correlation. On the other hand, when H
persistence. This means that whenever the time series have been up in the
last period, it is more likely that it will be down in the next period. Thus, an
anti-persistent time series will be more choppier than a pure random walk
with H = 0.5. The R/S analysis can also uncover average non-periodic
cycles in the system under study. If there is a long memory process at work,
for a natural system this memory is often ﬁnite, even though long mem-
ory processes theoretically are supposed to last forever, as was the case for
mathematical fractals and the logistic map. When the long term memory is
lost, or the memory of the initial conditions has vanished, the system begins
to follow a random walk; this is also called the crossover point. Thus, a
crucial point in the estimation of the Hurst exponent is to use the proper
range for which there is non-normal scaling behavior. This is the range for
which the scaling behavior is linear in the log(R/S)n versus log(n) plot.
If there is a crossover-point, this can be seen as a break in the plot where
the slope changes for a certain value, log(nmax). If this is the case, it is an
indication of a non-periodic cycle with average cycle length equal to nmax.

A plot of the rescaled range R/S as a function of τ for the TEPIX
returns over the mentioned period is shown in the curve of Fig.2. The
data in this case show a scaling regime that goes from τ = 2 up to 7 (in

for time series of small sizes [15].

3.2 Lo’s Modiﬁed R/S Analysis

The classical R/S test has been proven to be too weak to indicate a true long
memory process, in fact it tends to indicate a time series has long memory

when it does not.
In 1991 Lo [16] introduced a stronger test based on a
modiﬁed R/S statistics, which is known to be too strong to indicate a true
long memory process. Lo’s modiﬁed R/S test is described in brief below.

For a given series Ni, i = 1, 2, ...n, Lo deﬁnes the modiﬁed R/S statistic

as,

(11)

Lo ﬁnally standardizes the statistic Qn by dividing by √n and is denoted as
Vn(q). The numerator of Vn(q) is the range of deviation from the approxi-
mate linear trend line in a given interval and the denominator is the sample
variance augmented with weighted autocovariances up to a lag determined
q. For q = 0, this is same as the classical R/S statistic. This autocovariance
part of the denominator is non zero for series exhibiting short term memory

7

and this makes the statistic robust to heteroscedasticity.

Table 2 gives the results from the modiﬁed R/S statistic. R/S analysis
is extremely sensitive to the order of truncation q and there is no statistical
criteria for choosing q in the framework of this statistic. Since there is no
data driven guidance for the choice of this parameter, we consider diﬀerent
values for q = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 15. More explanations related to long
memory eﬀect and interpretation of data in Table 2 will be mentioned in
Section 7. In brief, the starred values in Table 2 reject null hypothesis of
short memory.

4 Detrended Fluctuation Analysis

Detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) is a scaling analysis technique pro-
viding a simple quantitative parameter-the scaling exponent α-to represent
the correlation properties of a time series [17]. The advantage of DFA over
many techniques are that it permits the detection of long-range correlations
embedded in seemingly non-stationary time series, and also avoids the spu-
rious detection of apparent long-range correlations that are an artifact of
non-stationarity. Additionally, the advantages of DFA in computation of H
over other techniques (for example, the Fourier transform) are:

inherent trends are avoided at all time scales;

local correlations can be easily probed.

•

•

8

To implement the DFA, let us suppose we have a time series, N (i)(i =

1, ..., Nmax). We integrate the time series N (i):

N (i).

Next we break up N (i) into K non-overlapping time intervals, In, of equal
1 and K corresponds to the integer part of
size τ where n = 0, 1, ...K
Nmax/τ . In each box, we ﬁt the integrated time series by using a polynomial
function, ypol(i), which is called the local trend. For order-l DFA (DFA-1 if
l=1, DFA-2 if l=2, etc.), the l-order polynomial function should be applied
for the ﬁtting. We detrend the integrated time series y(i) in each box, and
calculate the detrended ﬂuctuation function:

For a given box size s, we calculate the root mean square ﬂuctuation:

Y (i) = y(i)

ypol(i).

[Y (i)]2

The above computation is repeated for box sizes s (diﬀerent scales) to pro-
vide a relationship between F (s) and s. A power law relation between F (s)
sα. The parameter α,
and s indicates the presence of scaling: F (s)
called the scaling exponent or correlation exponent, represents the corre-
lation properties of the signal:
if α = 0.5, there is no correlation and the
signal is an uncorrelated signal [17]; if α < 0.5, the signal is anticorrelated; if
α > 0.5, there are positive correlations in the signal. In the two latest cases,
the signal can be well approximated by the fractional Brownian motion law
[15].

∼

In Fig.3 we plot in double-logarithmic scale the corresponding ﬂuctuation
function F (s) against the box size s. Using the above procedure, we obtain
the following estimate for the Hurst exponent: H = 0.72
0.01. Since
H > 0.5 it is concluded that the TEPIX returns show persistence; i.e, strong
correlations between consecutive increments. It is seen that for s
115 the
empirical data deviate from the initial scaling behavior. This indicates that
the TEPIX tends to loose its memory after a period of about 162 days.
Based on overestimating the Hurst exponent in the R/S analysis it may be
explained why the exponent H obtained via the Hurst method is usually
larger than that of the DFA method [18].

5 Generalized Hurst Exponents Approach

A generalization of the approach proposed by Hurst should be associated
with the scaling behavior of statistically signiﬁcant variables constructed
from the time series [19]. Therefore we analyze the q-order moments of
the distribution of the increments which is a good characterization of the
statistical evolution of a stochastic variable P (t). The generalized Hurst
H(q), for a time series P (t)(t = 1, 2, ...) are deﬁned by the
exponents, Hq ≡
scaling properties of its structure functions Sq(τ )

where q > 0, τ is the time lag and averaging is over the time box (window)
τ , usually the largest time scale of the system. The function H(q)
T
contains information about averaged generalized volatilities at scale τ (only
q = 1, 2 are used to deﬁne the volatility). In particular, the H(1) exponent
indicates persistent (H(1) > 0.5) or anti-persistent (H(1) < 0.5) behavior
of the trend. For the Brownian random walk one gets H(1) = 0.5. For the
popular L´evy stable and truncated L´evy processes with parameter α, it has
been found that H(q) = q/α for q < α and H(q) = 1 for q
α. In this
framework, we can distinguish between two kinds of processes:

≥

a process where H(q) = H, constant independent of q;

•

•

a process with H(q) not constant.

10

The ﬁrst case is characteristic of unifractal processes where qH(q) is linear
and completely determined by its index H. In the second case, when H(q)
depends on q, the process is commonly called multi-fractal and diﬀerent ex-
ponents characterize the scaling of diﬀerent q-moments of the distribution.

Eq. (13) is studied numerically in order to analyze the generalized qth-
order Hurst exponents in the structure function Sq(τ ). Table 3 includes the
values of the generalized Hurst exponents H(q) in the structure function for
the TEPIX. The values H(q) versus q for q = 1, ..., 10 are plotted in Fig. 3
for the TEPIX.

It should be noted that the methods listed above, that is, R/S analysis,
Lo’s R/S analysis and DFA can only extract a single scaling exponent from
a time series. However, it is possible that the given time series may be
governed by more than one scaling exponents, in which case a single scaling

11

exponent would be unable to capture the complex dynamics inherent in the
data. Analysis using generalized Hurst exponents method, elucidates the
dependence of H(q) on q, which is a hall mark of multifractal processes.
Such processes are far more than one exponent to characterize their scaling
properties [20].

6 Characteristic Exponent

Paul L´evy, the French mathematician, proposed a general approach with the
Gaussian as only a special case, to identify probability distributions which
their sum has the same probability distribution. A stable L´evy distribution
is represented by [21]

Lα(N,

t)

△

≡

π Z

0

exp(

−

△

(17)

where α is the characteristic exponent 0 < α
factor, and
t the time interval.
This distribution obeys below scaling relations:

△

2, N the return, γ the scale

and

N△t = Ns(

t)1/α

△

Lα(Ns,

t)

△

≡

Lα(Ns, 1)(

t)−1/α.

△

If α = 2 the distribution is Gaussian, and there is a ﬁnite second moment.
If α = 1 we have the Cauchy distribution with both inﬁnite ﬁrst and second
moments. In the region for which 1 < α < 2, the second moment becomes
inﬁnite, but with a stable mean. L´evy stable distributions are self-similar
and this means that the probabilities of return are the same for all time
intervals once we adjust for the time scale. Roughly speaking, an agent
with 1 min time interval faces the same risk as a 100 min agent in his
time interval when adjusted for scale. The α exponent takes this scaling
relationship into account.
The fractal dimension of the probability space, α, used in above Equations
is related to the Hurst exponent of the time series as:

(18)

(19)

(20)

In this way, characteristic exponent for return distribution of TEPIX
can be calculated. α exponents derived by using all of above methods has
been shown in Table 4.

These estimates of α are relatively close to each other. Based on α val-
ues, we observe a non-normal scaling behavior and all estimates indicate
that the process is diﬀerent from a pure random walk. In fact, these results

α =

H

.

are evidence of a non-linear chaotic system.
The distribution of TEPIX returns can be ﬁtted by a stable L´evy distribu-
tion. For a better comparison of the return distribution with a Gaussian
PDF and evaluating derived Hurst exponents, we have performed a max-
imum likelihood estimation of stable parameters. The parameters of this
ﬁtted L´evy distribution is presented in Table 5.

Alpha is the same characteristic exponent. Beta is the skewness in the

rameters respectively. A probability distribution function of returns against
Gaussian distribution with the mean and standard deviation of ﬁtted L´evy
distribution is depicted in Fig.5. Fitted L´evy distribution iself, is plotted in
the Fig.6. It can be seen from this ﬁgures that the the real distribution (or
the L´evy ﬁtted ones) of returns is diﬀerent from a Gaussian PDF (random
walk).

7 Long Memory Process

A random process is called a long memory process if it has an autocorrela-
tion function that is not integrable. This happens, for example, when the
autocorrelation function decays asymptotically as a power law of the form
τ −α with α < 1. This is important because it implies that values from the
distant past can have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the present, and implies anoma-
lous diﬀusion. A process is deﬁned as long memory if in the limit k

γ(k) =

k−αL(k)

∼

→ ∞

(21)

where 0 < α < 1 and L(x) is a slowly varying function at inﬁnity. The
degree of long memory dependence is given by the exponent α; the smaller
α, the longer the memory.
The Hurst exponent simply is related to α. For a long memory process

2H. Short memory processes have H = 1

H = 1
2 , and
the autocorrelation function decays faster than k−1. A positively correlated
long memory process is characterized by a Hurst exponent in the interval
(0.5, 1).
As an application of results provided by Lo’s modiﬁed R/S statistic, it can
be said [22], at the 5% signiﬁcance level, the null hypothesis of a short
memory process is rejected if the modiﬁed R/S statistic does not fall within
the conﬁdence interval [0.809, 1.862]. For returns, the null hypothesis of
short memory is rejected at any lags, except for 0 and 2. For absolute and
squared returns, the null hypothesis of short memory is rejected for all lag
orders.
Besides, the Hurst exponent is linked to the modiﬁed R/S statistic by

lim
T →+∞

E[RT /ST (q)]/(aT H ) = 1

(22)

with a > 0. With this link it is possible to obtain the following approximate
relationship:

(23)

log E[RT /ST (q)] ∼= log(a) + H log(t)
In order to estimate the value of the Hurst exponent, H, we ﬁrst determine a
series of estimates of the Hurst exponent by ﬁtting an ordinary least squares
regression between log[RT,l/ST,l(q)], l = 1, ..., j and log(l), l = 1, ..., j for ev-
ery j = 2, ..., T ∗, where RT,l and ST,l(q) are quantities related to RT and
ST (q), respectively. Then we choose the optimal estimate in this series. As a
result of such procedure, Hurst exponent has obtained equal to 0.721
0.001.
Therefore, the Lo’s method veriﬁes long memory process in returns of the
TEPIX, based on above discussions.

8 Market Stage of Development

Based on recent research for characterizing the stage of development of mar-
kets [23] it is shown that the exponent H(2) has sensitivity to the degree
of development of the market. As far as Stock markets are concerned, the
generalized Hurst exponents H(1), H(2) show remarkable diﬀerences be-
tween developed and emerging markets. At one end of the spectrum there
are stocks like as the Nasdaq 100 (US), the S&P 500 (US), the Nikkei 225
(Japan) and so on. Whereas , at the other end, there are Russian AK&M,
the Indonesian JSXC, the Peruvian LSEG, etc. This sensitivity of the scal-
ing exponents to the market conditions provides a new and simple way of
empirically characterizing the development of ﬁnancial markets.
Roughly speaking, emerging markets are associated with high value of H(1)
and developed markets are associated with low values of H(1). Besides, it
is found that all the emerging markets have H(2)
0.5 whereas all the
0.5.
developed have H(2)

Considering all of above discussions and results, we notice that Tehran Stock
Exchange belongs to emerging markets category and it is far from an eﬃ-
cient and developed market. Hurst exponent calculated by R/S and DFA
methods in one hand and generalized Hurst exponents (H(1) and H(2)) in
the other hand, both present this fact.
For the sake of comparison between various stock markets, the two ﬁrst gen-
eralized Hurst exponents are shown in Table 5. It must be noticed that all of
data in Table 6, except those corresponds to TEPIX, have been calculated
during 1997 to 2001 period [23], while those corresponds to TEPIX have
been calculated in the time period from 1995 to 2004.

These results indicate that, ﬁnancial market characteristics in Iran do
not show developed situations. In fact, Tehran Stock Exchange belongs to
the category of emerging ﬁnancial markets.

9 Conclusions

In this paper the concept of multifractality has been applied to Tehran Stock
Exchange data. This market show a fractal scaling behavior signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent from what a random walk would produce. For TEPIX time series
we have obtained a Hurst exponent greater than 0.5, indicating that the
TEPIX has long term dependence (persistence). This memory eﬀect seems
to last for up to about 6 months (115-128 trading days). Analysis using
generalized Hurst exponents method, indicates the dependence of H(q) on
q, which is an evidence of multifractal processes. Also, we show that based
on generalized Hurst exponents, ﬁnancial market characteristics in Iran do
not indicate a developed market. In other words, we are dealing with an
emerging capital market. These ﬁndings imply that there are patterns, or
trends in returns that persist over time. This provides a theoretical platform
supporting the use of technical analysis to produce above average returns.
The ﬁndings may be used to improve the current models or to make new

16

ones which use the concept of fractal scaling.

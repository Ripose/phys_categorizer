Abstract

We propose a method to estimate the probability of new physics
discovery in future high energy physics experiments. Physics simu-
lation gives both the average numbers < Nb > of background and
< Ns > of signal events. We ﬁnd that the proper deﬁnition of the sig-
niﬁcance for < Nb >, < Ns >
√< Nb > in comparison with often used signiﬁcances S1 =

1 is S12 = √< Ns > + < Nb >

and S2 =

√< Ns > + < Nb >

. We propose a method for taking into

account the systematical errors related to nonexact knowledge of back-
ground and signal cross sections. An account of such systematics is
very essential in the search for supersymmetry at LHC. We also pro-
pose a method for estimation of exclusion limits on new physics in
future experiments.

1 Introduction

One of the common goals in the forthcoming experiments is the search for new
phenomena. In the forthcoming high energy physics experiments (LHC, TEV22,
NLC, ...)
the main goal is the search for physics beyond the Standard Model
(supersymmetry, Z ′-, W ′-bosons, ...) and the Higgs boson discovery as a ﬁnal
conﬁrmation of the Standard Model. In estimation of the discovery potential of
the future experiments (to be speciﬁc in this paper we shall use as an example
CMS experiment at LHC [1]) the background cross section is calculated and for
the given integrated luminosity L the average number of background events is
L. Suppose the existence of a new physics leads to the nonzero
< Nb >= σb
signal cross section σs with the same signature as for the background cross section
that results in the prediction of the additional average number of signal events
< Ns >= σs

L for the integrated luminosity L.

·

The total average number of the events is < Nev >=< Ns > + < Nb >=
(σs + σb)
L. So, as a result of new physics existence, we expect an excess of the
average number of events. In real experiments the probability of the realization of
n events is described by Poisson distribution [2]

·

·

< n >n
n!
Here < n > is the average number of events.

f (n, < n >) =

<n>.

(1)

Remember that the Poisson distribution f (n, < n >) gives [3] the probability
of ﬁnding exactly n events in the given interval of (e.g. space and time) when the
events occur independently of one another and of x at an average rate of < n > per
the given interval. For the Poisson distribution the variance σ2 equals to < n >.
So, to estimate the probability of the new physics discovery we have to compare the
Poisson statistics with < n >=< Nb > and < n >=< Nb > + < Ns >. Usually,
high energy physicists use the following “signiﬁcances” for testing the possibility
to discover new physics in an experiment:

(a) “signiﬁcance” S1 =

(b) “signiﬁcance” S2 =

Nb, S1 and S2 diﬀer. Therefore, a natural question arises:

∼

It should be noted that there is a crucial diﬀerence between “future” exper-
iment and the “real” experiment. In the “real” experiment the total number of
events Nev is a given number (already has been measured) and we compare it with
< Nb > when we test the validity of the standard physics. So, the number of possi-
< Nb > and it is compared with the
ble signal events is determined as Ns = Nev
average number of background events < Nb >. The ﬂuctuation of the background
is σf b = √Nb, therefore, we come to the S1 signiﬁcance as the measure of the dis-
tinction from the standard physics. In the conditions of the “future” experiment
when we want to search for new physics, we know only the average number of
the background events and the average number of the signal events, so we have to
compare the Poisson distributions P (n, < Nb >) and P (n, < Nb > + < Ns >) to
determine the probability to ﬁnd new physics in the future experiment.

In this paper we estimate the probability to discover new physics in future
experiments. We show that for < Ns >, < Nb >

has been published in our early paper [8].

2 An analysis of statistical ﬂuctuations

Suppose that for some future experiment we know the average number of the
background and signal event < Nb >, < Ns >. As it has been mentioned in the
Introduction, the probability of realization of n events in an experiment is given
by the Poisson distribution

3

(2)

(3)

P (n, < n >) =

< n >n
n!

e−

<n>,

where < n >=< Nb > for the case of the absence of new physics and < n >=<
Nb > + < Ns > for the case when new physics exists. So, to determine the
probability to discover new physics in future experiment, we have to compare the
Poisson distributions with < n >=< Nb > (standard physics) and < n >=< Nb >
+ < Ns > (new physics).

Consider, at ﬁrst, the case when < Nb >

1, < Ns >
the Poisson distributions approach the Gaussian distributions

PG(n, µ, σ2) =

,

e−

with µ = σ2 and µ =< Nb > or µ =< Nb > + < Ns >. Here n is a real number.
The Gaussian distribution describes the probability density to realize n events
in the future experiment provided the average number of events < n > is a given
number. In Fig.1 we show two Gaussian distributions PG with < n >=< Nb >= 53
and < n >=< Nb > + < Ns > = 104 ([6], Table.13, cut 6). As is clear from Fig.1
the common area for these two curves (the ﬁrst curve shows the “standard physics”
events distribution and the second one gives the “new physics” events distribution)
is the probability that “new physics” can be described by the “standard physics”.
In other words, suppose we know for sure that new physics takes place and the
probability density of the events realization is described by curve II (f2(x) =
PG(x, < Nb > + < Ns >, < Nb > +Ns >). The probability κ that the “standard
physics” (curve I (f1(x) = PG(x, < Nb >, < Nb >))) can imitate new physics (i.e.
the probability that we measure “new physics” but we think that it is described
by the “standard physics”) is described by common area of curve I and II.

Numerically, we ﬁnd that

Let us discuss the meaning of our deﬁnition (4). For x

x0 = σ1σ2 we have
f2(x), i.e. the probability density of the standard physics realization is

higher than the probabilty density of new physics realization. Therefore for x
x0
we don’t have any indication in favour of new physics. The probability that the
x0
number of events is less than x0 is α =
f2(x)dx. For x > x0 f2(x) > f1(x) that
−∞
gives evidence in favour of new physics existence. However the probability of the

backround events with x > x0 is diﬀerent from zero and is equal to β =
So we have two types of the errors. For x
x0 we don’t have any evidence in
favour of new physics (even in this case the probabilty of new physics realization
is diﬀerent from zero). For x > x0 we have evidence in favour of new physics.
However for x > x0 the ﬂuctuations of the background can imitate new physics. So
the probability that standard physics can imitate new physics has two components
α and β and it is equal to κ = α + β. It means that the area of intersection of
the probabilty density functions of the pure background and the background plus
signal is the measure of the future experiments discovery potential.

For the case Ns = kNb, S12 = k12S2, where for k = 0.5, 1, 4, 10 the value of k12
is k12 = 0.55, 0.59, 0.69, 0.77. For not too high values of < Nb > and < Nb + Ns >,
we have to compare the Poisson distributions directly. Again for the Poisson
distribution P (n, < n >) with the area of deﬁnition for nonnegative integers we
can deﬁne P (x, < n >) for real x as

Nb = 1 (S1 = 5) κ = 14.2%. For Ns = Nb = 25 (S1 = 5) κ = 3.8%, whereas
asymptotically for Ns

3 An account of systematic errors related to
nonexact knowledge of background and sig-
nal cross sections

In the previous section we determined the statistical error κ (the probability that
“new physics” is described by “standard physics”). In this section we investigate
the inﬂuence of the systematical errors related to a nonexact knowledge of the
background and signal cross sections on the probability κ not to confuse a new
physics with the old one.

Denote the Born background and signal cross sections as σ0

Two loop corrections at present are not known. So, we can assume that the
uncertainty related with nonexact knowledge of cross sections is around δ1b and
δ1s correspondingly. In other words, we assume that the exact cross sections lie
in the intervals (σ0
s (1 + 2δ1s)). The average number of
background and signal events lie in the intervals

b (1 + 2δ1b)) and (σ0

To determine the probability that the new physics is described by the old one,
we again have to compare two Poisson distributions with and without new physics
but in distinction from Section 2 we have to compare the Poisson distributions
in which the average numbers lie in some intervals. So, a priori the only thing
we know is that the average numbers of background and signal events lie in the
intervals (9) and (10), but we do not know the exact values of < Nb > and < Ns >.
To determine the probability that the new physics is described by the old, consider
the worst case when we think that new physics is described by the minimal number
of average events

< N min

b >=< N 0

b > + < N 0

s > .

(11)

Due to the fact that we do not know the exact value of the background cross
section, consider the worst case when the average number of background events

As an example consider the case when δ1b = 0.5, < Ns >= 100, < Nb >= 50

to the probability κ = 0.24

2δ1b < Nb >= 50) gives κs = 0.0245.

Another example is with < Ns >= 28, < Nb >= 8 and δ1b = 0.5. For such

example we have S1 = 9.9, S2 = 4.7, S12 = 3.2, S12s = 2.0, κs = 0.045.

So, we see that an account of the systematics related to nonexact knowledge
of background cross sections is very essential and it decreases the LHC SUSY
discovery potential.

4 Estimation of exclusion limits on new physics

In this section we generalize the results of the previous sections to obtain exclusion
limits on signal cross section (new physics).

Suppose we know the background cross section σb and we want to obtain
bound on signal cross section σs which depends on some parameters (masses of new

8

particles, coupling constants, ...) and describes some new physics beyond standard
model. Again as in Section 2 we have to compare two Poisson distributions with
and without new physics. The results of Section 2 are trivially generalized for the
case of the estimation of exclusion limits on signal cross section and, hence, on
parameters (masses, coupling constants, ...) of new physics.

L

Consider at ﬁrst the case when < Nb >= σb

1
and the Poisson distributions approach the Gaussian distributions. As it has been
mentioned in Section 2 the common area of the Gaussian curves with background
events and with background plus signal events is the probability that ”new physics”
can be described by the ”standard physics”. For instance, when we require the
probability that ”new physics” can be described by the ”standard physics” is less
or equal 10% (S12 in formula (5) is larger than 1.64) it means that the formula

For the case of not large values of < Nb > and < Ns > we have to compare the

in Section 2. As an example in Table 7 we give 90% exclusion limits on the signal
1 and for diﬀerent values of background cross sections.
cross section for L = 104pb−
Formulae (14), (15) do not take into account the inﬂuence of the systemati-
cal errors related to nonexact knowledge of the background cross sections on the
exclusion limits for signal cross section. To take into account such systematics
we have to use the results of Section 3. The corresponding generalization of the
formulae (14) and (15) is straightforward, namely:

Remember that δ1b describes theoretical uncertainty in the calculation of the
background cross section. As an example, in Table 8 we give 90% exclusion limits
on the signal cross section for L = 104pb−
1, 2δ1b = 0.25 and for diﬀerent values
of background cross sections.

Note that in refs.[9, 10] diﬀerent and strictly speaking ”ad hoc” methods to
derive exclusion limits in future experiments has been suggested. As is seen from
Fig.3 the essential diﬀerences in values of the exclusion limits take place. Let us
compare these methods by the use of the equal probability test [11].

To estimate the diﬀerent approaches in determination of the exclusion limits
we suppose that the new physics exists, i.e. the value < Ns > equals to one of
the exclusion limits from Fig.3 and the value < Nb > equals to the corresponding
value of expected background. Then we apply the equal probability test to ﬁnd
critical value n0 for hypotheses testing in future measurements. Here a zero hy-
pothesis is the statement that new physics exists and an alternative hypothesis is
the statement that new physics is absent. After calculation of the Type I error α
(the probability that the number of observed events will be equal to or less than
the critical value n0) and the Type II error β (the probability that in the case
of absence of new physics the number of observed events will be greater than the
critical value n0) we can compare the methods. In Table 9 the comparison result
is shown. As is seen from this Table the ”Typical experiment” approach [10] gives
too small values of exclusion limits. The diﬀerence in the 90% CL deﬁnition is the
main reason of the diﬀerence between our results and the exclusion limits from
ref. [9].

5 The probability of new physics discovery

In section 2 we determined the probability κ that ”new physics” can be described
by the ”standard physics”. But it is also very important to determine the prob-
abilty of new physics discovery in future experiment. According to common deﬁ-
nition [1] the new physics discovery corresponds to the case when the probability
that background can immitate signal is less than 5σ or in terms of the probabilty
less than 5.7

7 (here of course we neglect any possible systematical errors).

too high values of < Ns > and < Nb >, when the deviations from the Gaussian
distributions are essential, our results are presented in Tables 1-6. We proposed a

method for taking into account systematical errors related to the nonexact knowl-
edge of background and signal events. An account of such kind of systematics is
very essential in the search for supersymmetry and leads to an essential decrease
in the probability to discover the new physics in the future experiments. We also
proposed a method for the estimation of exclusion limits on new physics in future
experiments.

We are indebted to M.Dittmar for very hot discussions and useful questions
which were one of the motivations to perform this study. We are grateful to
V.A.Matveev for the interest and useful comments.

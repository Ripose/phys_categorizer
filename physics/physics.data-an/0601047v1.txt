The formation of price in a ﬁnancial market is modelled as a chain of Ising spin with three
fundamental ﬁgures of trading. We investigate the time behaviour of the model, and we compare
the results with the real EURO/USD change rate. By using the test of local Poisson hypothesis, we
show that this minimal model leads to clustering and “declustering” in the volatility signal, typical
of the real market data.

Despite the obvious interest to adequately describe
the stochastic behaviour of price formation in a ﬁnancial
market [1], stochastic modelling misses some interesting,
and perhaps crucial characteristics of the real market. In
particular, it is well known that the market cannot be
adequately described by time series of independent and
identically distributed realizations of a random variable.
In fact time series in the ﬁnancial framework depend on
a large number of strongly interacting systems. Then,
the problem should be investigated in the framework of
complex systems.
In this case long-range correlations,
not obvious a priori and very diﬃcult to be adequately
modelled, are present in the system.
In this situation
every step towards the goal of analysing and describing
correlations is welcomed. The Ising spin system [2] is one
of the most frequently used models in statistical mechan-
ics. Being made simply by binary variables, the model is
able to reproduce diﬀerent complex phenomena in diﬀer-
ent areas of science like economy [3, 4, 5], biology [6] and
sociology [7], were many interactions are required among
various discrete elements. Some times ago a model of
this kind has been used to describe the decision making
mechanism of a closed community [8], where, in contrast
to the usual majority rules [9], the inﬂuence was spread-
ing outwards from the center.
In this paper we use the Ising spin as a minimal model
of ﬁnancial market, in order to investigate and repro-
duce the non-Poisson characteristics of isolated events in
price formation. Besides the statndard statistical tools,
we use a local analysis of time intervals between volatil-
ity events, which is not aﬀected by the non-stationarity
of the signal.
The dataset we investigate is
exchange rate
EURO/USD collected every minute during two months
in the period from May 25, 2004, up to July 31, 2004.
The exchange rate e(t) is represented by a discrete time
series where t = tk = k∆t (∆t is the sampling rate
and k = 0, 1, . . . , N ). The main quantities of interest
for traders within the market is the return of price r(t),
deﬁned as the change of the logarithmic price over a time
interval τ , namely G(t) = ln e(t + τ ) − ln e(t). A measure
of the magnitude of ﬂuctuations of prices used by traders
is the volatility, deﬁned as the absolute values of returns

VT (t) =

where n is an integer representing the moving average
window size. A further quantity is the autocorrelation
function of returns (or of volatility) deﬁned as

a(r, m) = P

N
n=m+1 [Gn − hGi] [Gn−m − hGi]
N
n=1 [Gn − hGi]

where Gn = G(tn). The main characteristics of the time
serie are summarized in Figure 1 where we show the time
evolution of various quantities, namely e(t), G(t) and
VT (t). We note the typical non-stationarity, the pres-
ence of bursty and explosive events in the return dataset
and of isolated volatility events.
We also report the autocorrelation function for both the
returns and the volatility (see Figure 2). While the for-
mer displays a very fast decay (mτ ≤ 10 min), the latter
displays a much longer persistent time lag.
Finally in Figure 3 we report the standardized probabil-
ity density function (PDF) of returns, which shows very
clearly typical “fat” tails.

The above characteristics can be adequately modelled
by the Ising spin chain. The community of interacting
agents which partecipate to the market, is modelled as
a chain of one-dimensional Ising spins si (i = 1, . . . , N ).
Each agent, at a time t, has an attitude to place buy
orders, described by an up-spin si(t) = 1, or to place
sell orders which is described by a down-spin si(t) = −1.
The price of the asset at a given time t is proportional to
the normalized diﬀerence between demand and supply

Here |y(t)| ≤ 1 represents a probability. The evolution
of the Ising chain is controlled by three simple rules that

Ref. [8]:
1) in general a lot of market agents follows the trend.
This is described by the rule that both agents in two next
neighbouring sites (i − 1, i + 2) follow the trend given by
agents placed in (i, i + 1), namely when sisi+1 = 1 then
si−1 = si+2 = si.
2) Some agents prefer to act on the market independently
on the neighbour agents. Then in absence of a precise
“tendency”, sites (i − 1, i + 2) are chosen at random,
namely when sisi+1 = −1 then both si−1 and si+2 are
randomly chosen in an independent way.
3) A third ﬁgure is partecipating to the market, that is an
agent with some knowledge external to the market. This
is known in literature as “fundamentalist” [4, 5]. This
ﬁgure has an exact knowledge of what happens in the
market so that he knows the diﬀerence between demand
and supply. If supply is greater than demand he places a

returns G(t) of

buy order, while he places a sell order when the demand
is greater than supply.
Realizations of the Ising spin model have been analysed
starting from a random sequence of N = 1000 spins at
t = 0. Each interaction between two agents is interpreted
as the tick-by-tick interaction between traders, while the
price ﬁxed at a given time t, deﬁned as p(t) = exp [y(t)],
is calculated after a single evolution of the whole chain.
Of course time is arbitrary in the Ising model. Actu-
ally, we have varied the value of the sampling rate in
the numerical dataset and we have compared it with the
real dataset. On the basis of the results obtained fron
the simulation, we can suppose that each update of the
whole chain represents the price every minute of the real
market. Then, in the following, p(t) is proportional to
e(t).
As in Ref. [8], we compare the real data of EURO/USD
exchange rate with the numerical results of the simula-
tion. The statistical analysis of p(t) shows the same fea-
tures of real exchange e(t), namely the non-stationarity
of the signal (see Figure 4), the behaviour of the corre-
lation functions (see Figure 5) and, ﬁnally, the fat tailed
PDFs of returns, as shown in Figure 6.

The statistical analysis carried on until now shows that
this minimal model of ﬁnancial market can capture many
features similar, in a statistical sense, to the real market
ones.
To further characterize the temporal properties of these
time series (exchange rate and stock price) and investi-
gate on the characateristics of isolated events in pricing
formation, we analyze the distribution of waiting times
(WT) between these events.
The statistical distribution of WT between discrete or
isolated “events” has been shown to be a powerful tool

to investigate and characterize temporal point processes
like solar ﬂares [10], earthquakes [11], dissipative events
in turbulent ﬂows [12], disruptions in laboratory plasmas
[13] and so on [14]. We consider the volatility of a ﬁnan-
cial market as a temporal point process with a certain
number of discrete “events”, as the spikes in Figures 1
and 4.
To quantify these events, we need to ﬁx a threshold,
above which we can select a spike as an “event”. We
adopted a method according which all events that are
above a certain threshold are cut. Then, we calculate the
ﬂatness of the remaining signal. The value of the thresh-
old is varied, until the ﬂatness of the remaining signal is
equal to the Gaussian value 3 [15]. At this point we cal-
culate the waiting times from the diﬀerence between the
end time and start time of two next events (quiet times).
The statistical analisys of such variables can be used
to detect the presence of long-range correlations in the

dataset. For example, the study of the autocorrelation
function of quiet times of long-term persistent records
can provide informations about the presence or not of
clustering in the extreme events
[14, 16]. Due to the
non-stationarity and the poor statistics of our dataset
(∼ 300 events) this kind of analisys can not be per-
formed. However, a local Poisson hypothesis test can
be used to check for presence of clustering in short and
non-stationary records [17, 18].
Let us consider the time sequence of extreme events
selected in the volatility data according the rules ex-
plained above. Let us suppose that each event occurs
at the discrete time ti; each ıth event can be associ-
ated to the two nearest and next nearest neighboring
events, which occur at the times ti−1, ti+1, ti−2 and
ti+2, respectively. Let δti = min{ti+1 − ti; ti − ti−1}
and let δτi be either = ti+2 − ti+1 (if δti = ti+1 − ti) or
δτi = ti−1 − ti−2 (if δti = ti − ti−1). If a local Poisson
hypothesis holds, both δti and δτi are indipendently dis-
tributed according two Poissonian probability densities:
P (δti) = 2λi exp(−2λiδti) and P (δτi) = λi exp(−λiδτi).
In this case, the stochastic variable H deﬁned as

H =

δti
δti + 1

2 δτi

is uniformely distributed in [0; 1] and it has a cumulative
distribution P (H ≥ h) = 1 − h independent on λ. In a
process, where δτis are systematically smaller than 2δtis,
much more events are found respect to the Poissonian
case, that is clusters are present and the average value
of H is greater than 1/2. Conversely, a value of hHi
less than 1/2 means that voids are present in the signal.
The values of H have been calculated from the volatil-

for the events obtained from both dataset. Indeed, the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test gives a probability of 1.7% for
Poissonian distributions of WT of both dataset. The av-
erage value hHi = 0.47 ± 0.3 and the shape of P (H)
in Figure 7(a) indicate that voids and clusters are both
present in a same fashion in both signals.
Several observational evidences of clustering in the mar-
ket volatilities can be found in literature and numerical
models [19, 20, 21]. They refer to the clustering volatility
phenomenon as a clustering of time periods when volatil-
ity ﬂuctuates very strongly and its autocorrelation func-
tions show very long persistent time lags. Several ap-
proaches have been guessed to describe this phenomenon,
as in Ref. [22]. Here, by using the test of local Poisson
hypothesis for the ﬁrst time, we can provide a quanti-
tative measure of the phenomenon of volatility cluster-
ing in ﬁnancial time series and we show that voids are
also present. In summary, we have shown that a mini-
mal spin model leads to a fat-tailed distribution function
for returns, short-time dependence in the autocorrelation
function of returns and, on the contrary, long-term de-
pendence in the volatility signal which shows the typical
clustering and “declustering” of the real market data.

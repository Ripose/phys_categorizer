ABSTRACT
Millisecond and binary pulsars are the most stable natural frequency standards which
admits to introduce modiﬁed versions of universal and ephemeris time scales based
correspondingly on the intrinsic rotation of pulsar and on its orbital motion around
barycenter of a binary system. Measured stability of these time scales depends on
numerous physical phenomena which aﬀect rotational and orbital motion of the pulsar
and observer on the Earth, perturb propagation of electromagnetic pulses from pulsar
to the observer and bring about random ﬂuctuations in the rate of atomic clock used
as a primary time reference in timing observations. On the long time intervals the main
reason for the instability of the pulsar time scales is the presence of correlated, low-
frequency timing noise in residuals of times of arrivals (TOA) of pulses from the pulsar
which has both astrophysical and geophysical origin. Hence, the timing noise can carry
out the important physical information about interstellar medium, interior structure
of the pulsar, stochastic gravitational waves coming from the early universe, etc. Each
speciﬁc type of the low-frequency noise can be described in framework of power law
spectrum model. Although the data processing of pulsar timing observations in time
domain seems to be the most imformative it is signiﬁcantly important to know to which
spectral bands single and binary pulsars, considered as detectors of the low-frequency
noise signal, are the most sensitive. Solution of this problem may be reached only if
a parallel processing of timing data in frequency domain is fulﬁlled. This requires a
development of the Fourier analysis technique for an adequate interpretation of data
contaminated by the correlated noise with a singular spectrum. The given problem is
examined in the present article.

1 INTRODUCTION

Millisecond and binary pulsars are known as exellent probes for testing theory of general relativity
Taylor & Weisberg 1982, 1989), structure of interstellar medium (Rickett 1990, 1996) and interior
of neutron stars (Cordes & Greenstein 1981, Kaspi et al. 1994) as well as setting upper limit on
the energy density of primordial gravitational radiation (Kaspi , Thorsett & Dewey 1996, McHugh
et al. 1997, Kopeikin 1997a, Kopeikin & Wex 1999). Rotational motion of a pulsar around its own
axis had been proposed (Shabanova et al. 1979, Backer et al. 1982, Rawley et al. 1987, Matsakis
et al. 1997) for using as a new time reference being analogue of universal time in astrometry.
Quite recently, a new step toward to estiblishing a stable time scale on extremely long intervals

approaching 50-100 years has been suggested (Ilyasov et al. 1998, Kopeikin 1999). It is extracted
from the orbital motion of pulsar in a binary system and represents the analogue of ephemeris time
of classical astronomy introduced by Newcomb (1898)at the end of last century and based on the
orbital motion of the Earth around the Sun.

An adequate analysis of timing data requires deeper understanding of nature of a noise process
dominating in pulsar timing residuals. As soon as the autocovariance function of the noise process
is known the analysis in time domain becomes possible. Time domain analysis is the most informa-
tive since the observed stochastic process is not usually stationary and includes the non-stationary
component as well (Groth 1975, Cordes 1978, 1980; Kopeikin 1997b). Because pulsar timing obser-
vations are conducted on relatively long time intervals the white noise of errors in measuring TOA
of pulsar’s pulses will be suppressed by the presence of a number of correlated, low-frequency (red)
noises having diﬀerent spectra and intencities. Henceforth, we are mainly interested in analysing
the red noise.

The simple model of such noise has been worked out by one of us (Kopeikin 1997b). It is based
on the shot noise approximation and do includes a dependence of the autocovariance function on
both stationary and non-stationary components of red noise. In the process of elaborating the given
model a rather remarkable fact has been established (Kopeikin 1999), namely, that timing residuals
and variances of some spin-down and all orbital parameters are not aﬀected by the non-stationary
component of the red noise at all. This discovery put on a ﬁrm ground the Fourier analysis of TOA
residuals and variances of ﬁtting parameters in frequency domain. This analysis gives exhaustive
information about the noise process itself and admits us to reveal to which frequency harmonics in
the spoectral expansion of the stochastic process pulsar timing observations are the most sensitive.
Moreover, just we have an adequate approach for the treatment of red noise in frequency domain
a lot of interesting applications is opened having the goal to study the physical nature of the low
frequency noises with arbitrary spectrum.

Any low-frequency noise can be approximately characterized by the power-law spectrum S(f ) ∼
f −n where the spectral (integer) index n ≥ 1. It is obvious that the spectrum has a singularity
at zero frequency. Hence, the energy of TOA residuals comprised in such noise should has inﬁnite
value because the integral over all frequencies from zero to inﬁnity taken from S(f ) is divergent.
Clearly, this has no physical meaning and one has to resort to special mathematical tricks in order
to avoid this artiﬁcial divergency. There are two ways for curing this ﬂaw. First of them consists in
analytical continuation of the spectrum by changing it from S(f ) ∼ f −n to S(f, A) ∼ f −(n+A) where
A is the pure complex parameter being diﬀernt from zero. Such model of the analitically continued
spectrum gives convergent integrals which coincide everywhere on real axis with ones taken from
the spectrum S(f ) ∼ f −n exept for the point f = 0. In order to prescribe a physical meaning to
such integrals we have to expand them in the Laurent series with respect to the parameter A and
to take the ﬁnite part of the expansion. Such procedure has been used, in particular, by Kopeikin
(1997a) for calculation of autocovariance function of stochastic noise of the primordial gravitational
wave background having spectrum S(f ) ∼ f −5 (Mashhoon 1982, 1985, Mashhoon & Seitz 1991,
Bertotti et al. 1983).

The procedure of analytical continuation of divergent inetgrals is mathematically rigorous and
theoretically powerful tool which gives well-deﬁned and self-consistent results (Gel’fand & Shilov
1964). However, it is inconvinuent for people doing numerical computations. For them, the second
method of regularization of singular spectra seems to be more preferable and practically useful.
It is based on the truncation of all divergent integrals at the lower cut-oﬀ frequency f = ε along
with corresponding modiﬁcation of the power-law model of the red noise spectrum in order to
avoid the model dependence of results of ﬁtting procedure on the artiﬁcially introduced cut-oﬀ
frequency. It will be shown that the simplest way of modiﬁcation of the spectrum can be reduced
to the addition to the existing power-law spectrum of red noise of the inﬁnite sum consisting of the

Dirac delta function and its derivatives having local support at the lower cut-oﬀ frequency f = ε.
Such modernization of the spectrum preserves the structure of the autocovariance function and,
as a consequence, do not vilolate results of numerical computations in time domain. This second
method of regulariazation of divergent integrals will be used in the present paper.

In what follows it is more convinuent for us to work in terms of dimensionless frequency and
time. For instance, in binary pulsars it is preferable for analytic calculations to measure time in
units of orbital frequency nb = 2π/Pb, where Pb is the orbital period of the binary. Then, frequency
f is measured in units of 1/Pb and dimensionless time is the pulsar’s mean anomaly u = nbτ .
Hereafter, we use u instead of τ .

2 REGULARIZED SPECTRUM OF LOW-FREQUENCY NOISE

Any gaussian low-frequency noise is completely characterized by the autocovariance function which
describes correlation between two values of stochastic process separated by the arbitrary time
interval τ = t2 − t1. Autocovariance function consists usually of two algebraically independent
parts characterizing separately stationary R−(τ ) and non-stationary R+(τ ) components of the
noise. Complete expressions of autocovariance functions for diﬀerent events of low-frequency noise
have been derived in the paper (Kopeikin 1997b) where the shot noise approximation of stochastic
process has been used. Although both stationary and non-stationary components of autocovariance
function are important for an adequate treatment of observations (Kopeikin 1999) we are dealing in
the present paper only with the stationary part which posseses to be transformed into the spectral
density of noise S(f ) by means of the Wiener-Khintchine theorem

R−(u) = 2

S(f ) cos(2πf u)df.

If (constant) intensity of noise is denoted by hn then autocovariance function of low-frequency
correlated noise is determined by the expression (Kopeikin 1997b)

n = 2, 4, 6, ..., random walk noise




Cnhnun−1 ln |u|, n = 1, 3, 5, ..., ﬂicker noise
where Cn is a numerical constant of normalization.


Functions, which might be appropriate candidates for the spectrum of noise procesess with the
foregoing autocovariance functions, are S(f ) = constf −n where n is integer. However, integrals (1)
from such power-law functions are divergent because of non-physical singularity at zero frequency.
For this reason, regularization technique should be used because we don’t know usually the low-
frequency behavior of the spectrum.

2.1 Analaitic Continuation Technique

Analytic continuation regularization procedure is contained in that one extends the spectrum S(f )
in the complex plane domain by introducing the function

S(f, A) = constf −n−A

where A is a complex parameter. Autocovariance function becomes an analytically continued func-
tional of the complex variable A:

which coincides (due to the properties of analytically continued complex functions) exactly with
the integral in (1) exept at the point A = 0. The functional (4) with the spectrum deﬁned by eq.
(3) is a table integral and can be easily calculated analitically. After calculation of the integral it
is expanded in the Laurent series near the point A = 0. It yields

R−(u, A) =

The ﬁrst term in the expansion is a simple pole with respect to A. The second term in the expansion
is ﬁnite and gives exactly the autocovariance function given in eq. (2). Regularization of the integral
(4) means that we take only its ﬁnite part and abandon the singular term. Analytic continuation
technique is powerful theoretical tool (Kopeikin 1997a) but it hardly can be used in numerical
computations for which infrared cut-oﬀ technique is much better.

2.2 Infrared Cut-oﬀ Technique

The power spectrum S(f ) of the noise is deﬁned using the truncated Fourier transform with the
lower cut-oﬀ frequency f = ε. Namely, we require that the truncated cosine Fourier transform of
S(f ) must give the stationary part of the original autocovariance function (2) without any additional
contributions. Let us postulate that the spectrum S(f ) may be represented by the formula

n − th derivative with respect to f of the Dirac delta-function δ(f − ε). The Dirac delta function
is deﬁned according to the condition (Korn & Korn 1968)

where f (x) is arbitrary function being such that unilateral limits f (X − 0) and f (X + 0) exist.
Coeﬃcients Bk(ε) are determined by the condition that the cosine Fourier transform of S(f ) gives
stationary part of autocovariance function of corresponding low-frequency noise the model of which
may be found in papers (Kopeikin 1997b, 1999). As an example of derivation of Bk(ε) we determine
the several ﬁrst coeﬃcients Bk(ε) in the event of ﬂicker noise in pulsar’s rotational phase which
has the spectral index n = 1. Coeﬃcients Bk(ε) for noises having other spectral indices will be
displayed in this section without proof which is rather straightforward.

Stationary part of autocovariance function R−(τ ) of ﬂicker noise in pulsar’s phase is equal to

h1π−1 log |u|. According to deﬁnition of the spectrum we should have

For practical purposes it is enough to account for the coeﬃcient B0(ε) only, since all other resid-
ual terms appear being multiplied by the factor 2πεu which is negligibly small under the usual
circumstances because of smallness of the product εu. Thus, residual terms are not important as
long as the accuracy of observations is not high enough. It is worth emphasizing that the residual
terms under discussion are model dependent. Had we chosen another model for the spectrum having
slightly another behavior as frequency approaches to zero the residual terms would look diﬀerently.
These arguments permit to estimate how long we can observe a certain pulsar and process the data
with one or another model of red noise spectrum.

Proceeding in the same way for the set of other spectral indeces we obtain the following expres-

sions for the power spectra of low-frequency noises:

(cid:27)

Let us note that the coeﬃcient B4(ε) ≡ 0 in the expression (18) for spectrum of random walk in
frequency derivative.

The expressions given above indicate that there is a strong concentration of inﬁnite energy of
the noise at the lower cut-oﬀ frequency. As we have stressed already it is a speciﬁc feature of the
chosen model of the spectrum which appears because we do not know a real behavior of spectrum
while frequency is approaching to zero. Another remark is that a direct integration of any of the
foregoing spectra with respect to frequency from f = ε to inﬁnity (which may be erroneosly treated
as the energy being stored in TOA residuals) gives zero value which may look surprising. However,
it is worth noting that the entire energy presents in TOA residuals can be calculated only after
multiplication of the spectrum by the ﬁlter function (see section 6 below for more detail). Therefore,
calculation of the total energy of residuals is more complicated and always gives a positive numerical
value as it should be. Similar arguments can be used in calculating variances of ﬁtting parameters.
For example, calculation of variances of the ﬁrst several spin-down parameters in frequency domain
may give a negative numerical value of the variance (Kopeikin 1999) which is physically meaningful.
The paradox is solved if we remember about contribution of the non-stationary part of noise which
always makes variances of the parameters numerically positive (for more detail see (Kopeikin 1999)).
Pulsar timing observations can be used for estimation of strength and spectrum of low frequency
noise presents in TOA residuals. For this reason, development of practically useful estimators of
spectrum of noise are required. We are not going to consider in the present paper the question about
how to construct the best possible estimators. This subject has been enlightened by a number of
other researches (see, for instance, the papers of Deeter & Boynton (1982), Deeter(1984), Taylor
1991, Matsakis al. 1997). Our purpose is to study spectral dependence of TOA residuals and
variances of ﬁtting parameters which are used in real practice. In order to make clear what we are
doing let us describe, ﬁrst of all, the timing model we are dealing with.

3 TIMING MODEL

We consider a simpliﬁed, but still realistic model of arrival time measurements of pulses from a
pulsar in a binary system. It is assumed that the orbit is circular, and the pulsar rotates around
its own axis with angular frequency νp which slows down due to the electromagnetic (or whatever)
energy losses. It is also taken into account that the orbital frequency of the binary system, nb, and
its projected semimajor axis, x, have a secular drift caused by radial acceleration of the binary
(Damour & Taylor 1991, Bell & Bailes 1996), its proper motion of in the sky (Kopeikin 1996), and
emission of gravitational waves from the binary (Peters & Mathews 1963, Peters 1964) bringing
about the gravitational radiation reaction force (Damour 1983a, Grishchuk & Kopeikin 1983).

c(cid:13) 1999 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

Millisecond and Binary Pulsars as Nature’s Frequency Standards

The moment T of emission of the N -th pulsar’s pulse relates to the moment t of its arrival mea-
sured at the inﬁnite electromagnetic frequency by the equations (Damour & Taylor 1992, Kopeikin
1994, 1999):

D [T + x sin (nbT + σ)] = t + ϕ0(t) + ϕ1(t),
t = τ ∗ + ∆C + ∆R⊙ + ∆π⊙ + ∆E⊙ + ∆S⊙.
We use the following notations:

• T - pulsar time scale,
• t - barycentric time at the barycenter of the Solar system,
• τ ∗ - topocentric time of observer,
• ∆C, ∆R⊙, ∆π⊙, ∆E⊙, ∆S⊙ - clock and astrometric corrections (Taylor & Weisberg 1989,

Doroshenko & Kopeikin 1990, 1995) which one assumes to be known precisely,

• D - Doppler factor gradually changing due to the acceleration and proper motion of the binary

system in the sky ⋆

• σ - initial (constant) orbital phase,
• nb - orbital frequency (nb = 2π/Pb),
• i - angle of inclination of the orbit to the line of sight,
• x - projected semimajor axis ap of the pulsar’s orbit (x = ap sin i/c),
• c - speed of light,
• ϕ0(t) - the gaussian noise of TOA measuring errors,
• ϕ1(t) - low-frequency gaussian noise caused by the long-term instabilities of terrestrial clocks,
eﬀects in propagation of radio signals in the interstellar medium and stochastic background of
primordial gravitational waves, etc.

accounts only for linear terms which is enough for implication of least square method of ﬁtting
parameters to the data. All non-linear residual terms of order x2, xǫ, ǫ2, ˙νx, ¨νx, etc. are negligible
and, for this reason, have been omitted from (22).

We assume that all observations of the binary pulsar are of a similar quality and weight. Then
one deﬁnes the timing residuals r(t) as a diﬀerence between the observed number of the pulse,
N obs, and the number N (t, θ), predicted on the ground of our best guess to the prior unknown
parameters of timing model (22), divided by the pulsar’s rotational frequency ν, that is

r(t, θ) =

N obs − N (t, θ)
ν

,

(24)

where θ = {θa, a = 1, 2, ...k} denotes a set of k measured parameters (k = 14in the model(22))
which are shown in Table 1. It is worth noting that hereafter we use for the reason of convinuence
the time argument u = nbt, that is the current orbital phase. If a numerical value of the parameter
θa coincides with its true physical value ˆθa, then the set of residuals would represent a physically
meaningful noise ǫ(t), i.e.
r(t, ˆθ) = ǫ(t).

In practice, however, the true values of parameters are not attainable and we deal actually with
their least square estimates θ∗

a of a priori unknown true values of parameters ˆθa.

In the following it is more convenient to regard the increments βa as new parameters whose
values are to be determined from the ﬁtting procedure. The parameters βa and ﬁtting functions are
summarized in Table 1 with asterisks omitted and time t is replaced for convenience by the function
u = nbt which is the current value of orbital phase. We restrict the model to 14 parameters since
in practice only the ﬁrst several parameters of the model are signiﬁcant in ﬁtting to the rotational
and orbital phases over the available time span of observations.

Let us introduce auxilary functions Ξa(t) deﬁned according to the formula:

Ξa(t) =

Now suppose that we measure m equally spaced and comparably accurate arrival times each orbit
for a total of N orbital revolutions, so we have mN residuals ri ≡ r(ti), i = 1, ..., mN. Standard
least squares procedure (Bard 1974) gives the best ﬁtting solution for estimates of the parameters
βa

βa(T ) =

Ξa(ti)ǫ(ti),

a = 1, ..., 14.

Let the angular brackets denote an ensemble average over many realizations of the observational
procedure. Hereafter, we assume that the ensemble average of the noise ǫ(t) is equal to zero. Hence,
the mean value of any parameter βa is equal to zero as well, i.e.

< ǫ(t) >= 0

< βa >= 0.

The covariance matrix Mab ≡ < βaβb > of the parameter estimates is now given by the expression

where f is the Fourier frequency measured in units being inversly proportional to units of mea-
surement of time t. We measure time in units of orbital phase u = nbt, that is in radians. Then
the frequency ω = 2πf is dimensionless and measured in units of orbital frequency nb. One notes
the Fourier transfrom of the ﬁtting functions depends on the Fourier frequency f , total amount of
orbital revolutions N, and frequency of observations m.

When the total amount of observational points, mN, is large we can approximate the sum (36)

by the integral (Kopeikin 1999)

5 FOURIER TRANSFORM OF THE COVARIANCE MATRIX

In order to calculate the covariance matrix we need to know the Fourier transform of the dual
functions Ξa(t). The transform is deﬁned in accordance with deﬁnition (27) of the dual functions
and takes the form

and the cross-orthonormal condition in frequency domain is given by the integral

In the limit of continuous observations it is convinuent to introduce matrix Cab = 2π

m Lab instead

of the matrix Lab. Explicit expression for the matrix Cab is given by the integral:

and the result of calculation of the integral is given in the paper (Kopeikin 1999, Tables 5,6). Then
we have L−1

ab and the dual function ˜Ξ(f ) can be recast as

m C −1

Hence, comparing the eq. (71) with (68) one concludes that in the limit of continuous observations
the Fourier transfrom of the dual functions depend only on the Fourier frequency and total amount
of orbital revolutions as it was expected. It is more insightful to express the dual functions (71) in
terms of the spherical Bessel functions (60). The expressions obtained are rather unwieldy and, for
this reason they are given in Appendix A. Plots of the Fourier transform of the spherical Bessel
functions are given in Appendix D.

Making use of deﬁnition of the Fourier transforms of stationary part of autocovariance function
(8) and the dual functions (68) we obtain the Fourier transform of stationary part of the covariance

Plot of the Fourier transform (77) of the ﬁlter function K(f ) is shown in Appendix E for diﬀerent
amount of orbital revolutions N. It is approximately equal to 1 until frequency is higher than 1/T ,
and rapidly decreases its amplitude as frequency approaches to zero. We also note that the curve
of the Fourier transform clearly shows the additional dip near the orbital frequency. The dips near
zero and orbital frequencies are getting narrower as a number of observational points increases.

7 SPECTRAL SENSITIVITY OF TIMING OBSERVATIONS OF MILLISECOND AND BINARY

PULSARS

Analytical expressions and graphical representations of Fourier transforms of dual functions and
timing residuals help us to understand in more detail spectral sensitivity of single and binary pulsars
to diﬀerent frequency bands in spectral decomposition of noise. First of all, let consider behavior
of Fourier transform of ﬁtting functions near zero and orbital frequencies.

It is easy to conﬁrm after making use of Taylor expansion of exponential function in (38) near

Now we can study asymptotic behaviour of ﬁlter function K(f ) deﬁned by eq. (77). Taking into

account the fact that

where B0 and B1 are numerical constants. Such speciﬁc behavior of the ﬁlter function K(f ) sig-
niﬁcantly reduces the amount of detected red noise below the cut-oﬀ frequency fc ≃ αcT−1 and in
the frequency band 1 − αbT−1 ≤ f ≤ 1 + αbT−1 lying near the orbital frequency. Here constant
coeﬃcents αc and αb can be determined by means of comparision of calculations of mean value of
timing residuals in time and frequency domains (Kopeikin 1997a). Low frequencies of noise power
spectrum are ﬁtted away by the polynomial ﬁt for the spin-down parameters of the observed pulsar.
Frequencies being close to the orbital one are ﬁtted away by the ﬁt for orbital parameters of the
pulsar. Amount of noise power remained in timing residuals after completion of ﬁtting procedure
is estimated by the expression

The second term in the right hand side of eq. (83) shows amount of noise absorbed by ﬁtting orbital
parameters. It is negligibly small comparatively with ﬁrst term in the right hand side and can be
not taken into account in practice. Hence, we declare that the post-ﬁt timing residuals can be used
for estimation of amount of red noise and its spectrum in frequency band just from αcT−1 up to
inﬁnity, irrespectively of whether the pulsar is binary or not. This reasoning puts on ﬁrm ground the
estimates of spectral window of timing observations and cosmological parameter Ωg, characterizing
energy density of stochastic gravitational waves in early universe, made by Kaspi et al. (1994) and
Camilo et al. (1994) using observations of binary pulsars PSR B1855+09 and PSR J1713+0747
respectively.

Analysis of spectral sensitivity of estimates of variances of spin-down and orbital parameters
is more cumbersome. We are interested in which frequencies give the biggest contribution to the
variances. This is important to know, for example, in the event of using variances of certain orbital

Analitic calculations reveal the leading terms in asymptotic expansions of the dual functions near
zero frequencies:

Squares of the dual functions ˜ξa appearing in eqs. (B1)-(B14) and eqs. (C1)-(C14) is rather
complicated. Their behavior is periodic with bumps both near zero and orbital frequencies with
rapidly decaying occilating wings far outside these frequencies. We evaluated that the frequency
bump for the spin-down parameters near zero frequency is bigger than that near the orbital one. On
the other hand, the situation for orbital parameters is just opposite. Analitic behavior of the dual
functions shows that there are two spectral windows in which they are the most sensitive to the
stochastic noise. One is located near zero frequency and the second one lies near the orbital one. We
can bound these windows by two frequency intervals (0, α
T ) respectively where
constant coeﬃcients α, α−, α+ can be calculated by means of comparison of results of calculation
of variances in time and frequency domains. It allows easily to calculate contributions from the
foregoing frequency bands to numerical values of variances of ﬁtting parameters and determine
which of these frequency bands makes bigger deposit. Variances of ﬁtting parameters depend only
on the total span, T , of observations (Kopeikin 1997b). Comparing dependence of the variances
on T calculated in time domain with that calculated in two frequency windows reveal the relative
importance of diﬀerent frequencies. In order to do this we have to compare magnitude of two
integrals

T ) and (1 − α−

The ﬁrst integral describes contribution of low frequencies to parameter’s variances. The second
integral gives contribution to parameter’s variances from the frequencies lying near the orbital
one. It is worth emphasizing that terms with delta function and its derivatives in (84) bring on
mutual cancellation of all terms depending on cut-oﬀ frequency ε and diverging as ε goes to zero.
Such cancellation has been expected since we modiﬁed the spectrum of red noise so that to avoid
appearance of all divergent terms which have no physical meaning. We don’t give here results of
calculation of numerical values of parameters α, α−, α+ because they are not so important for
making conclusions. Asymptotic behavior of the dual functions near zero and orbital frequency is
enough to see which frequncy band is the most important for giving contribution to corresponding
integrals and parameter’s variances. Time dependence of two integrals is shown in Table (3) up
to not so important constant. Behavior of variances of the ﬁrst three spin-down parameters is

not interesting for they are contaminated by the presence of the non-stationary part of red noise
(Kopeikin 1997b). For the rest of spin-down parameters one observes that contribution of noise
energy from low frequencies to variances of the parameters is dominating. However, the situation is
not so simple in the event of orbital parameters. One can see that in the event of red noise having
T , 1+ α+
spectral index n ≤ 4 contribution of the noise energy from the orbital frequency span (1− α−
T )
can be equal to or even bigger than that from the low frequency band. Only when the spectral index
of noise n ≥ 5 contribution of the noise energy of low frequencies to variances of orbital parameters
begins to dominate. It is worth noting that the timing noise with spectral index n = 5 is produced
by cosmological gravitational wave background. The fact that for this noise low-frequencies give the
main contribution to variances of orbital parameters conﬁrms our early statement (Kopeikin 1997a)
that measurement of variances of orbital parameters showing secular evolution tests the ultra-low
frequency band of cosmological gravitational wave background. Hence, these variances can be used
for setting upper limit on the cosmological parameter Ωg in this frequency range in contrast to
timing residuals which test only low-frequency band of the background noise. (Kopeikin 1997a).

We investigate statistical properties of daily international market indices of seven countries,
and high-frequency S&P 500 and KOSDAQ data, by using the detrended ﬂuctuation method and
the surrogate test. We have found that the returns of international stock market indices of seven
countries follow a universal power-law distribution with an exponent of ζ ≈ 3, while the Korean
stock market follows an exponential distribution with an exponent of β ≈ 0.7. The Hurst exponent
analysis of the original return, and its magnitude and sign series, reveal that the long-term-memory
property, which is absent in the returns and sign series, exists in the magnitude time series with
0.7 ≤ H ≤ 0.8. The surrogate test shows that the magnitude time series reﬂects the non-linearity
of the return series, which helps to reveal that the KOSDAQ index, one of the emerging markets,
shows higher volatility than a mature market such as the S&P 500 index.

INTRODUCTION

Up to now, numerous studies analyzing ﬁnancial time
series have been carried out to understand the complex
economic systems made up of diverse and complicated
agents [1]. The statistical analysis of economic or ﬁ-
nancial time series exhibits features diﬀerent from the
random-walk model based on the eﬃcient market hy-
pothesis (EMH), which are called stylized facts [2-15].
Previous studies showed that the returns of both stocks
and foreign exchange rate have a variety of stylized facts.
For example, the distribution of ﬁnancial time series fol-
lows a universal power-law distribution with an exponent
ζ ≈ 3 [3-7]. While the temporal correlation of returns fol-
lows the process of random walks, the volatility of returns
shows a long-term-memory property [12-15]. However,
recent work has revealed that the distribution function
of returns in emerging markets follows an exponential dis-
tribution, while the mature markets follow a power-law
distribution with an exponent ζ ≈ 3 [11].

In this paper, we use Detrended Fluctuation Analysis
(DFA), which was introduced by Peng et al. to ﬁnd the
long-term-memory property of time series data [16] and
utilizes the surrogate test method proposed by Theiler et
al. to measure the non-linearity of time series [17]. We
study daily international market indices of seven coun-
tries from 1991 to 2005, the high-frequency S&P 500 5-
minute index from 1995 to 2004, and the high-frequency

KOSDAQ 1-minute index from 1997 to 2004, to investi-
gate diverse time characteristics of ﬁnancial market in-
dices.

We found that the returns of international stock mar-
ket indices of seven countries follow a universal power-law
distribution with an exponent of ζ ≈ 3, while the Korean
stock market follows an exponential distribution with an
exponent of β ≈ 0.7. For a more detailed statistical anal-
ysis, the original return time series is divided into mag-
nitude and sign time series, and the corresponding Hurst
exponents are computed. The Hurst exponent analysis
of the original return, and its magnitude and sign time
series, reveal that the long-term-memory property, which
is absent in the return and sign time series, exists in the
magnitude time series with 0.7 ≤ H ≤ 0.8.

In order to test the nonlinearity of the time series, the
surrogate test is performed for all time series. We ﬁnd
that the magnitude time series reﬂects the non-linearity
of the return series, which helps to reveal that the KOS-
DAQ index, one of the emerging markets, shows higher
volatility than a mature market such as the S&P 500
index.

In the next section, we explain the market data used
in our investigations. In Section III., we introduce the
methods of the surrogate test and detrended ﬂuctuation
analysis (DFA). In Section IV., the results of the statis-
tical analysis for various time series of the market data
are presented. Finally, we end with a summary of our
ﬁndings.

II. DATA

Then, rk is multiplied by random phases,

We use the return series in eight daily international
market indices of seven countries from 1991 to 2005, the
S&P 500 index (5 minutes) from 1995 to 2004, and the
KOSDAQ index (1 minute) from 1997 to 2004. The seven
countries are France (CAC40), Germany (DAX), United
Kingdom (FTSE100), Hong Kong (HangSeng), KOREA
(KOSPI), America (NASDAQ), Japan (Nikkei225), and
America (S&P 500). We make use of the normalized
return often used in the ﬁnancial time series analysis in-
stead of the stock prices. Let y1, y2, ....yn, be the daily
stock prices. The normalized return Rt at a given time t
is deﬁned by

rt = ln yt+1 − ln yt,
ln yt+1 − ln yt
σ(rt)

Rt ≡

,

where σ(rt) is the standard deviation of the return. The
normalized returns Rt are divided into magnitude and
sign series by using the following relation:

Rk,t = |Rk,t| × Signk,t,

(2)

where Rk,t is the return series of the k-th market index
calculated by the log-diﬀerence, |Rk,t| the magnitude se-
ries of the returns of the k-th market index, and Signk,t
the sign series with +1 for the upturn and −1 for the
downturn. Note that the magnitude series |Rt| from tak-
ing the absolute value of the return measures the size of
the return change, and the sign series Signt measures the
direction of the change. The volatility of the returns can
be studied though the magnitude series |Rt|.

III. METHODS

A. Surrogate Test

The surrogate test method was ﬁrst proposed by
Theiler et al.
to prove the non-linearity contained in
the time series [17]. The surrogate data test can be ex-
plained by the following four steps [16]. First, a null
hypothesis is made and the features of the linear pro-
cess following the hypothesis are deﬁned. In general, the
linearity uses the mean, the variance, and the autocorre-
lation of the original time series. The surrogate data are
randomly generated but retain the autocorrelation func-
tion, the mean, and the variance of the original data. In
the second step, the surrogate data are created through
the Fast Fourier Transform(FFT) method. Let rn be the
original time series. The Fourier Transform rk of rn is
given by

˜rk = rkeiφk ,

(4)

where φk is uniformly distributed in [0, 2π]. The inverse
FFT of ˜rk gives the surrogate data retaining the linearity
in the original time series,

(5)

In the third step, non-linear measurements with the en-
tropy, the dimension, and Lyapunov exponents are per-
formed for the original data and the surrogate data, re-
spectively. Finally, the diﬀerence in measurements of the
original data and the surrogate data is tested for signiﬁ-
cance. If signiﬁcant, the hypothesis will be rejected and
the original data are regarded as having non-linearity.

B. Detrended Fluctuation Analysis

The typical methods to analyze the long-term-memory
property in the time series data are largely classiﬁed into
three types: the re-scaled range analysis (R/S) method
proposed by Mandelbrot and Wallis [19], the modiﬁed
R/S analysis by Lo et al. [18], and the DFA (detrended
ﬂuctuation analysis) method by Peng et al. [20]. In this
paper, the DFA method is used due to its eﬀectiveness
even for the absence of long-term memory. The Hurst
exponent can be calculated by the DFA method through
the following process.

Step (1): The time series after the subtraction of the

mean are accumulated as follows:

y(i) =

[x(i) − ¯x],

(6)

N

X
i=1

where x(i) are the i-th time series, and ¯x is the mean of
the whole time series. This accumulation process is one
that changes the original data into a self-similar process.
Step (2): The accumulated time series are divided into
In each box of length n,
boxes of the same length n.
the trend is estimated through the ordinary least square
method, called DFA(m), where m is the order of ﬁtting.
In each box, the ordinary least square line is expressed as
yn(i). By subtracting yn(i) from the accumulated y(i) in
each box, the trend is removed. This process is applied
to every box and the ﬂuctuation magnitude is calculated
by using

rk =

rnei2πnk/N .

The process of Step (2) is repeated for every scale, from
which we obtain a scaling relation

F (n) ≈ cnH ,

(8)

where H is the Hurst exponent. The Hurst exponent
characterizes the correlation of time series with three dif-
ferent properties. If 0 ≤ H < 0.5, the time series is anti-
persistent. If 0.5 < H ≤ 1, it is persistent. In the case of
H = 0.5, the time series correspond to random walks.

IV. RESULTS

In this section, we analyze the statistical features of
daily international market indices of seven countries from
January 1993 to May 31, 2005, the S&P 500 5-minute in-
dex from 1995 to 2004, and the KOSDAQ 1-minute index
from 1997 to 2004. We present the results of the statisti-
cal features such as the cumulated distribution function
(CDF) and the time correlation of the various ﬁnancial
time series. Figure 1(a) is a log-log plot of the cumu-
lative distribution function of the market indices of six
countries, excluding Korea, from January 1991 to May
2005. Figure 1(b) is a linear-log plot of the distribution
function of the KOSPI index.

In Figure 1(a), we ﬁnd that the tail exponents of the
indices of all the countries except Korea follow a universal
power-law distribution with an exponent ζ ≈ 3. However,
in Figure 1(b), we ﬁnd that the Korean stock market
follows an exponential distribution with β ≈ 0.7, not a

power-law distribution. These results indicate that the
distribution of returns in the KOSPI index, that belongs
to the emerging markets, does not follow a power-law
distribution with the exponent ζ ≈ 3.

Figure 2 shows the Hurst exponents for the returns
of each international market index, calculated from the
return, magnitude and sign time series. The long-term-
memory property is not found for the return and sign
series with H ≈ 0.5. However, we ﬁnd that the magni-
tude time series has a long-term-memory property with
H ≈ 0.8. The surrogate test plots denoted as (surro) in
Figure 2 show that the magnitude time series reﬂects the
non-linearity of the original returns, while the sign time
series shows the linearity of the original returns.

In order to investigate the scaling in high-frequency
data, we use the S&P 500 5-minute index from 1995
to 2004 and the KOSDAQ 1-minute index from 1997
to 2004. Figure 3(a) shows the Hurst exponents of the
return, magnitude and sign series for the S&P 500 5-
minute index and the KOSDAQ 1-minute index. As for
international stock market indices, the sign series corre-
sponds to random walks (H ≈ 0.5), but the magnitude
series has a long-term-memory property (0.7 ≤ H ≤ 0.8).
Figure 3(b) shows that all Hurst exponents of the corre-
sponding surrogate data follow random walks.

In order to ﬁnd the time evolution of the Hurst ex-
ponent, we also investigated the time series by shifting
the S&P 500 5-minute index and KOSDAQ 1-minute in-
dex by 500 minutes and 100 minutes, respectively. Fig-
ure 4 shows the Hurst exponent calculated with 6,000
data points by shifting approximately 500 minutes for
the S&P 500 5-minute index, from 1995 to 2004. The
average Hurst exponent H ≈ 0.5 for the S&P 500 index
sign series of the returns, and H ≈ 0.7 for the magnitude
time series. In addition, the surrogate test shows that
the non-linearity of the original time series is reﬂected

Figure 5 shows the Hurst exponent calculated with
6,000 data points by shifting approximately 100 minutes
for the KOSDAQ 1-minute index from 1997 to 2004 .
Though on average H ≈ 0.5, the Hurst exponent of the
returns changes considerably over time, unlike the S&P
500 index with a more or less uniform Hurst exponent.
In particular, in the KOSDAQ index during its bubble
period from the second half of 1999 to mid-2000, a large
long-term-memory property is observed in the return se-
ries. After the market bubble burst, we found that the
Hurst exponent of the returns dropped to 0.5. This result
indicates that the KOSDAQ index may have improved its
market eﬃciency after the bubble. As in the previous re-
sults, the non-linearity of the original time series of the
KOSDAQ data is reﬂected in the magnitude time series,

and the linearity in the sign time series.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have investigated the statistical fea-
tures of international stock market indices of seven coun-
tries, high-frequency S&P 500 and KOSDAQ data. For
this purpose, the tail index was studied through a linear
ﬁtting method by using the Hurst exponent by the DFA
method. Also, the non-linearity was measured through
the surrogate test method. We ﬁnd that the absolute
value distribution of the returns of international stock
market indices follows a universal power-law distribution,
having a tail index ζ ≈ 3 . However, the Korean stock
market follows an exponential distribution with β ≈ 0.7,
not a power-law distribution.

We also found that in the time series of international
market indices, the S&P 500 index and the KOSDAQ
index, the returns and sign series follow random walks
(H ≈ 0.5), but the magnitude series does not. On the
other hand, we found that in all the time series, the Hurst
exponent of the magnitude time series has a long-term-

5

memory property (0.7 ≤ H ≤ 0.8). Furthermore, we
found that in high-frequency data, the KOSDAQ index,
one of the emerging markets, shows higher volatility than
a mature market such as the S&P 500 index, which is pos-
sibly caused by the abnormally generated bubble. We
found a long-term-memory property in the magnitude
time series of all data, regardless of nation or time scale.
Non-linear features of the returns are generally observed
in the magnitude time series. However, the degree of dis-
tribution and correlation in the returns of all data diﬀer
in emerging and mature markets. Our results may be
useful in analyzing global ﬁnancial markets, for example,
diﬀerentiating the mature and emerging markets.

ABSTRACT

Three slow glitches in the rotation rate of the pulsar B1822−09 were

revealed over the 1995–2004 interval. The slow glitches observed are charac-

terized by a gradual increase in the rotation frequency with a long timescale

of several months, accompanied by a rapid decrease in the magnitude of the
frequency ﬁrst derivative by ∼ 1–2 per cent of the initial value and subsequent

exponential increase back to its initial value on the same timescale. The cu-

mulative fractional increase in the pulsar rotation rate for the three glitches
amounts to ∆ν/ν0 ∼ 7 × 10−8.

1 INTRODUCTION

Many pulsars exhibit signiﬁcant variations in their rotation rates superimposed on the deter-

ministic pulsar spin-down due to electromagnetic torque. Rotation variations may occur in

the form of glitches - sudden increases in rotation frequency and in the form of timing noise -

random variations in pulse arrival times. For slow pulsars, a rotation phase is well described

by a simple ν, ˙ν spin down model. The values of the second derivative ¨ν due to slowdown

are usually very small in comparison to the measurement uncertainties. The signiﬁcant sec-

ond derivatives measured for most slow pulsars are manifestations of random walk processes

that produce timing residuals with cubic polynomial components (Cordes & Helfand 1980).

These cubic structures make up 30 per cent of many diﬀerent structures observed in the

timing residuals (Hobbs et al. 2003). The strength of timing noise is correlated with the

period derivative and is quantiﬁed by the stability parameter based on a non-zero second

derivative of the rotation frequency (Cordes & Downs 1985; Arzoumanian et al. 1994).

PSR B1822−09 is of great interest as it enables the timing behaviour of a pulsar to be

studied over a long observing span. It has a period of 0.769 s, a large period derivative of
52.36 × 10−15, implying a relatively young characteristic age of ∼ 230 kyr. An analysis of

timing data over the observational interval 1989–1993 by Arzoumanian et al. (1994) showed

that this pulsar possesses considerable timing noise described by the stability parameter

∆8=-1.2. Timing observations for a longer interval of 3000 days (Lyne 1996) before the

glitches occurred also showed that this pulsar is among the noisiest pulsars. During this

interval, variations in pulse arrival times for the pulsar were characterized by red power

spectrum and consequently, timing residuals relative to a simple spin-down model were

described by a cubic term corresponding to the signiﬁcant second derivative.

In 1994 September the pulsar suﬀered a small glitch with ∆ν/ν ∼ 0.2 × 10−9 (Shabanova

1998). This glitch was typical, associated with a sudden increase in the rotation frequency.

Subsequent monitoring of the pulsar showed evidence for a new kind of timing variations

which may be described in terms of a slow glitch. Since 1995, the pulsar has suﬀered three

slow glitches. The present paper is the third in series studying the glitch behaviour of the
pulsar B1822−09. The signature of the ﬁrst slow glitch occurred in late 1995 was described

in the ﬁrst paper (Shabanova 1998). It was shown that the slow glitch observed was char-

acterized by a gradual increase in the rotation frequency during 620 days, accompanied
by a rapid decrease in the magnitude of the frequency ﬁrst derivative by ∼ 0.4 per sent

and subsequent increase back to its initial value on the same time span. In the second pa-

per (Shabanova & Urama 2000), the glitch behaviour of the pulsar for the period 1991–1998

was studied at widely separated frequencies of 0.1 and 1.6/2.3 GHz using quasi-simultaneous

observations made at the Pushchino Radio Astronomy Observatory (PRAO) and the Harte-

beesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory (HartRAO). The authors showed that the ν and

˙ν changes with time are similar at both observational frequencies and reported the second
large decrease in the magnitude of the frequency derivative by ∼ 2.4 per sent which occurred

in 1998 August. The present paper summarises the results of the two previous papers, re-

ports the third slow glitch occurred in 2000 December and presents the description of the
timing behaviour of PSR B1822−09 over the 19-yr data span from 1985 to 2004.

The third slow glitch was independently detected by Zou et al. (2004) and published in

a recent paper obtained from astro-ph after submission of the present paper. Comparison

between the results presented in both papers is given in the results section.

2 OBSERVATIONS AND TIMING ANALYSIS

Timing observations of the pulsar have been made at the Pushchino Observatory at frequen-
cies around 102.5 and 112 MHz with the BSA transit radiotelescope, using a 32 × 20 kHz

ﬁlter bank receiver. Observations have been conducted since 1991 a few times per month

and lately daily. The detected signal was sampled at 1.28-ms intervals and integrated syn-

chronously with the apparent pulsar period for 3.2 minutes of the BSA transit time. After

the dispersion removal the signals from all the channels were summed to form an average

pulse proﬁle for a single observation.

The topocentric arrival times for each observation were calculated by cross-correlating an

average pulse proﬁle with a low-noise template and then were corrected to the barycenter of

the Solar System using the TEMPO software package1 and the JPL DE200 ephemeris. A pul-

sar position and a proper motion assumed in this correction were taken from Arzoumanian et al.

(1994) and Fomalont et al. (1992), respectively. A simple spin-down model involving a ro-

tation frequency ν and its ﬁrst derivative ˙ν was used for ﬁtting to the barycentric arrival

times giving the pulse phase φ at the time t as

φ(t) = φ0 + ν(t − t0) + ˙ν(t − t0)2/2,

(1)

where φ0 is the phase at some reference time t0. The diﬀerences between the observed

times and times predicted from a best ﬁt model gave the timing residuals which were used

for an analysis of the pulsar rotation behaviour.

3 RESULTS

In order to study variations in the spin-down parameters of the pulsar in more detail, the

rotation frequency and frequency ﬁrst derivative were calculated by performing local ﬁts to

the arrival time data over the intervals of 120–200 days. The timing data set analysed includes

the Pushchino data collected for the period 1991–2004 and the HartRAO data collected over

the 1985–1998 interval and taken from the previously published paper (Shabanova & Urama

3.1 Signature of the ﬁrst slow glitch

This section presents a detailed description of the signature of the ﬁrst slow glitch, using the

ν, ˙ν data published in the two previous papers (Shabanova 1998; Shabanova & Urama 2000).

During the period 1991–1998, the pulsar suﬀered two glitches, the ﬁrst of which occurred

at the end of September, 1994 (MJD 49615) and had a typical signature, while the second

occurred about a year later (MJD 49940) and exhibited an unusual signature related to a

gradual increase in the pulsar rotation frequency. The plots of ˙ν and ∆ν together with the

timing residuals over the interval 1992–1998 are shown in Fig. 1. The frequency residuals are

given relative to a simple slow-down model, involving the mean value of ν0 and ˙ν0 deﬁned

over the interval 1991–1994, where the behaviour of the pulsar was steady. The values of

˙ν and ∆ν were calculated from the local ﬁts, performed over intervals of 120 days. The

plotted points agree well with the mean spin-down parameters up to the 1994 glitch. This
glitch was quite small with the fractional increase of rotational frequency equal to 0.8×10−9.

Apparently, the glitch was followed by a relaxation in frequency as shown in Fig. 1b.

From Figs. 1a and 1b, it is seen that ˙ν and ∆ν begin to vary considerably shortly after
the 1994 glitch. During the ∼ 500-day interval from the middle of 1995 to the end of 1996, ˙ν

was smaller than the mean spin-down. The observed changes in ˙ν involve two similar events.

The ﬁrst one occurred at about MJD 49874 when ˙ν rapidly decreased by approximately 0.7

per cent of the initial value, while the second one occurred at about MJD 50253 when ˙ν
decreased by ∼ 0.3 per cent of the initial value. Both the events were followed by an increase

back to its initial value. The relaxations are well described by two diﬀerent exponential

components with timescales of 100 and 80 days, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1a.

Fig. 1b shows that a slow increase of the frequency residuals relative to the pre-glitch data

begins when ˙ν rapidly reaches its minimum value (near MJD 49874). The slow growth of ∆ν

is well described by a combination of two asymptotic exponential functions with the same

timescales of 100 and 80 days. The frequency residuals after subtracting these asymptotic

exponentials are given in Fig. 1c. The size of the slow glitch after a span of two years is equal
to ∆ν/ν0 = 13 × 10−9. Apparently, the slow glitch observed is about one order of magnitude

larger than the 1994 glitch which showed a typical signature.

The timing residuals relative to the best-ﬁt for ν and ˙ν for the data from the interval

of 1200 days preceding the 1994 glitch and for the data from the interval of 1400 days

following the 1994 glitch are presented in Fig. 1d. The timing residuals for the data over the

period 1995–1998 when the slow glitch was observed, have quasi-periodic structure with the

amplitude of about 80 ms. From Figs. 1b and 1d, it is clear that the changes in the slope of

the curves of frequency and timing residuals reﬂect the detailed structure in the frequency

ﬁrst derivative ˙ν.

3.2 Observed properties of the slow glitches

Fig. 2a shows ˙ν as a function of time over the entire data span of 19 years from 1985 to 2004.

A plot of ∆ν versus time is given in Fig. 2b. As before, the frequency residuals are presented

relative to the data from the interval 1991–1994. Here, the local ﬁts were performed over

intervals of 200 days. The dependencies of ν and ˙ν on time are diﬀerent for the timing

data collected before and after the 1994 glitch. A long-term linear trend in ˙ν is well seen

in the pre-glitch data. Both the plots show that there is a large pre-glitch frequency second
derivative ¨ν = 8.9 × 10−25s−3. It is most likely related to timing noise.

The behaviour of the three slow glitches after 1995 can be clearly seen in Figs. 2a and 2b.

The signature of the ﬁrst slow glitch was analysed in detail in the previous section. Common

properties of the slow glitches observed may be described as follows. The slow glitches are

characterized by a rapid initial decrease in the magnitude of ˙ν and subsequent increase back

to its previous value with a long timescale of several months. This causes a gradual growth

in the frequency residuals ∆ν with the same timescale. The epoch of a slow glitch is the

time at which ˙ν rapidly reaches its minimum value. This epoch is slightly earlier than the

epoch when the timing residuals begin to show the negative change after the slow glitch.

The derived parameters of the three slow glitches observed in the rotation rate of the
pulsar B1822−09 are given in Table 1. A fractional decrease of the frequency derivative is

about 0.7, 2.7 and 1.7 per cent for the three events, respectively. The form of the subsequent

increase back to its initial value is well modelled by an exponential function with a timescale

of 235, 80 and 110 days, respectively. A gradual growth in rotation frequency ν is well

described by asymptotic exponential functions with the same timescales of 235, 80 and 110
days. A fractional increase in frequency of ∆ν/ν0 is about 13, 20 and 31 ×10−9 for the three

slow glitches, respectively.

The integrated eﬀect of the three slow glitches at the present time (for example, on
May 25, 2004) is equal to ∆ν ∼ 89 × 10−9 Hz that gives the total fractional increase in
the rotation frequency of ∆ν/ν0 ∼ 68 × 10−9. This means that at the indicated epoch the

pulsar period is approximately 53 ns less than the expected value from extrapolation of the

pre-glitch 1991–1994 model. As a result, the pulsar begins to rotate faster than it would if

the slow glitches had not occurred.

The third glitch was also detected by Zou et al. (2004) at the observing frequency of 1540
MHz and described as slow glitch, too. The size of this glitch with ∆ν/ν = 31.2(2) × 10−9

is in good agreement with the result in Table 1. However, there is a discrepancy between

the quoted values of the changes in the frequency derivative. Zou et al. (2004) give ∆ ˙ν/ ˙ν =
1.9(1)×10−3, that is one order magnitude smaller than ∆ ˙ν/ ˙ν given in Table 1. The signature

of ∆ν and ˙ν shown in their Fig.2 over the interval MJD 51500–53000 is consistent with that

plotted in Figs. 2a and 2b of the present paper. The small event in ˙ν reported by Zou et al.

(2004) as the next possible slow glitch between MJD 52798 and 52969 is clearly seen in

our plot, too. The good agreement between the results describing the signature of the third

slow glitch at diﬀerent frequencies of 112 and 1540 MHz provides strong evidence for the
existence of unusual glitch phenomenon in the pulsar B1822−09.

The frequency residuals relative to the new model ﬁt involving the new values of ν and ˙ν

from the interval 1995–2004 where the three slow glitches occurred, are presented in Fig. 2c

on the right hand plot. It is clearly seen that the rotation frequency of the pulsar relative to

the new ﬁt shows the oscillation behaviour. The timescale of this oscillation can be estimated
to be ∼ 1000 days.

3.3 Timing residuals of the pulsar

A full picture of the timing residuals for the pulsar B1822−09 over the 19-yr data span

between 1985 and 2004 is presented in Fig. 3. Analysis of the entire data set showed that all

arrival times cannot be described by a simple spin-down model within half the pulsar period

because of the presence of several glitches. Therefore, the timing residuals were obtained

from three independent polynomial ﬁts for ν and ˙ν over three diﬀerent intervals indicated in

the plot by the horizontal lines. The corresponding mean values of the spin-down parameters

are given in Table 2. The errors are given in units of the last quoted digit. The derived models

are a good representation of the timing behaviour of the pulsar for the total data span of 19

years and successfully predict the pulse arrival times and the pulse periods over the present

observing session.

For the ﬁrst interval 1985–1994, the timing residuals relative to a simple spin-down

model show a large cubic term which corresponds to a large frequency second derivative
¨ν = 8.9 × 10−25s−3. The magnitude of ¨ν for this pulsar is a measure of the amount of timing

noise (Lyne 1996). It gives the timing noise parameter ∆8=-0.94 that agrees well with that
of Arzoumanian et al. (1994). The derived braking index, n = ν ¨ν/ ˙ν2 ∼ 145, is too large to

be due to the pulsar slowdown and indicates the high level of timing noise, too. This timing

behaviour was interrupted by a small glitch occurred in 1994 September.

The second interval is a short one-year interval 1994–1995 following the 1994 glitch and

preceding the ﬁrst slow glitch in 1995 August. During this interval the pulsar exhibits the

timing residuals dominated by the random deviations at a level of a few milliseconds with a

zero mean.

The third interval is a long interval from 1995 to 2004 where the three slow glitches

occurred. The plot shows that variations in the pulse arrival times have oscillatory structure

with a large amplitude of about 150 ms. Three cycles of this structure are caused by the

three slow glitches observed for this interval. It is seen that the timing residuals presented in

Fig. 3 well correspond to the frequency residuals of Fig. 2. Comparison between the values

of the period derivative for diﬀerent intervals indicated in Table 2 shows that the presence

of slow glitches decreases signiﬁcantly the mean value of the period derivative.

4 DISCUSSION

The main result of this paper is detailed description of a new kind of timing variations which

may be explained in terms of a slow glitch. Results of the two previous papers (Shabanova

1998; Shabanova & Urama 2000) and also the present paper have shown that the pulsar
B1822−09 suﬀered three slow glitches over the 1995–2004 interval. The third slow glitch

was independently detected by Zou et al. (2004) and the authors have interpreted unusual
glitch phenomena in PSR B1822−09 as slow glitches, too. Characteristic properties of the

slow glitches observed are a gradual increase in the rotation frequency with a long timescale

of several months, accompanied by a rapid decrease in the magnitude of the frequency
derivative by ∼ 1–2 per cent of the initial value and subsequent exponential increase back

to its initial value with the same timescale. The size of a slow glitch after a span of a
few years is rather moderate, with the fractional increase ∆ν/ν ∼ 20 × 10−9. An obvious

relaxation in frequency after a slow glitch is not observed. An analysis of observations of large

samples of pulsars (Cordes & Helfand 1980; Gullahorn & Rankin 1982; Cordes & Downs

1985; Lyne et al. 1992, 1993; D’Alessandro et al. 1995; Johnston et al. 1995; Shemar & Lyne

1996; Wang et al. 2000; Krawczyk et al. 2003) showed that an event similar to a slow glitch

was not observed earlier in any pulsar.

Fig. 2 shows that the small glitch of 1994 lies between two regions with diﬀerent behaviour

of the frequency derivative. It is of interest whether this glitch could aﬀect the character of

timing variations and whether this small glitch could act as a trigger for a slow glitch, about

two orders of magnitude larger.

It is known that variations in the pulsar rotation rate in the form of glitches and timing

noise are an important source of information on neutron star interiors (Baym et al. 1969;

Alpar et al. 1984; Pines & Alpar 1985). These events are common to many pulsars and arise

from sudden and irregular transfer of angular momentum between a more rapidly rotating

interior superﬂuid and a solid crust of a neutron star. Pulsar glitches are characterized by
a sudden increase in rotation frequency with ∆ν/ν ∼ 10−10 to 10−6, followed by a post-

glitch relaxation. They are accompanied by an increase in the magnitude of the frequency
derivative with ∆ ˙ν/ ˙ν ∼ 10−3 to 10−2, which decays after the glitch (Shemar & Lyne 1996).

The pulsar glitches and post-glitch relaxation reﬂect changes in the angular momentum

distribution inside a neutron star (Alpar et al. 1993).

The signature of slow glitches, as they have been observed in the spin rate of the pulsar

Observations of three slow glitches in PSR B1822−09

B1822−09, is quite diﬀerent. The existence of a gradual glitch, as a response of a neutron

star to a perturbation in its temperature, was predicted by a model in which a glitch was

associated with a thermal instability in a neutron star (Greenstein 1979). A slow glitch

may be a thermal response of a neutron star to a sudden local increase of the inner crust

temperature (Link & Epstein 1996). However, the behaviour of the frequency derivative - a

rapid initial decrease and subsequent exponential increase back to the initial value, is not

accounted for by the thermal glitch model. It seems more likely, the signiﬁcant variations

in spin-down rate have to be attributed to variations in braking torque. A decrease in spin-

down rate requires a corresponding decrease in torque that brakes rotation of the pulsar

crust.

Torque variations may be caused by changes in the magnetosphere structure, for example,

the variations of the polar cap size. The region of magnetosphere which rigidly corotates

with a neutron star is restricted to the light cylinder. In order to decrease ˙ν, the region of a

corotating magnetosphere should decrease, i.e. closed magnetic ﬁeld lines should temporarily

open and then the polar cap size should increase. The measured oscillatory behaviour in the
rotation frequency ν on the timescale of ∼ 1000 days reﬂects the oscillatory changes in

torque which suggests the existence of a long-term oscillation in the polar cap size. This

oscillation could be accompanied by observable changes in an average pulse proﬁle shape

which is determined mainly by the structure of the magnetic ﬁeld.

It should be noted that the pulsar B1822−09 is a very interesting object. It exhibits

simultaneously four rare properties of the pulsar emission. Three unusual properties as mode-

changing of the average pulse proﬁle, drifting subpulses and interpulse emission were revealed

by Fowler et al. (1981) in the frequency range 1620–2650 MHz. The forth property - the

microstructure in the main pulse emission, was detected by Gil et al. (1994) at the frequency

of 1420 MHz. At the low frequency of 112 MHz, these unusual properties are not seen. An

analysis of the width and intensity of the average pulse proﬁle made for the data span before

and after the glitches did not show any changes within the precision of the measurements. It

is reasonable to search for a correlation between the times of slow glitches and the occurrence

of mode-changing and other properties of the pulsar emission in the data obtained at high

frequencies where the mentioned properties are clearly seen.

the residuals for the slow glitch after subtracting the two asymptotic exponentials on timescales of 100 and 80 days. d) Timing
residuals relative to independent ﬁts for ν and ˙ν to the data ∼ 1200 days before the 1994 glitch and 1400 days after the 1994
glitch. Arrows indicate the time at which the 1994 glitch occurred. The exponential ﬁts drawn as thick-lines in panels (a) and

Figure 2. The frequency ﬁrst derivative and frequency residuals for PSR B1822−09 from 1985 to 2004. The 1994 glitch and
three slow glitches during the 1995–2004 interval are clearly seen in the data. a) ˙ν versus time. Three rapid decreases in ˙ν over
the interval 1995–2004 are the eﬀect of the slow glitches. The horizontal line denotes the mean value of ˙ν0 over the 1991–1994
interval. b) ∆ν relative to a ﬁt to the data for the interval 1991–1994. Signiﬁcant cumulative change in the rotation rate is the
eﬀect of the three slow glitches. c) As for (b) but with ∆ν relative to a new ﬁt to the data for the 1995–2004 interval where the
slow glitches occurred. Arrows indicate the time at which the 1994 glitch occurred. The exponential ﬁts drawn as thick-lines
in panels (a) and (b).

Figure 3. Timing residuals for PSR B1822−09 between 1985 and 2004 relative to a ﬁt to the data for the following three
intervals: 1985–1994, 1994–1995 and 1995–2004. The length of each interval is indicated by the horizontal line. The bottom
arrow indicates the epoch at which the 1994 glitch occurred. The three upper arrows indicate the epochs at which the three
slow glitches occurred.

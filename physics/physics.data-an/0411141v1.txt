Abstract

Using coherence analysis (which is an extensively used method to study the cor-
relations in frequency domain, between two simultaneously measured signals) we
estimate the time delay between two signals. This method is suitable for time delay
estimation of narrow band coherence signals for which the conventional methods
cannot be reliably applied. We show by analysing coupled R¨ossler attractors with
a known delay, that the method yields satisfactory results. Then, we apply this
method to human pathologic tremor. The delay between simultaneously measured
traces of Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Electromyogram (EMG) data of sub-
jects with essential hand tremor is calculated. We ﬁnd that there is a delay of 11-27
milli-seconds (ms) between the tremor correlated parts (cortex) of the brain (EEG)
and the trembling hand (EMG) which is in agreement with the experimentally ob-
served delay value of 15 ms for the cortico-muscular conduction time. By surrogate
analysis we calculate error-bars of the estimated delay.

1 Introduction

The time delay between two dynamical systems can provide information on
conduction velocity, and the nature and origin of coupling, between the pro-
cesses. So it is necessary to use a well validated method for this purpose.
Literature on time delay is vast and well documented in [1, 2]. Often, in phys-
iological time series analysis, a single method cannot be made unique to be
applicable for a wide class of data stemming from the processes seemingly
operated by similar mechanisms. Methods used for time delay estimation are
no exception from this fact. Here, we use a spectral based method, maximis-
ing coherence, for the time delay estimation [3]. First, we apply this method
to uni- and bi-directionally coupled R¨ossler attractors with a known delay
between the systems. In both cases, the results obtained are in good agree-
ment within a narrow range of the delay used in the simulation. Then, we
apply this method to simultaneously recorded traces of Electroencephalogram
(EEG) and Electromyogram (EMG) of subjects with essential tremor a well
known pathological form of hand tremor. We obtain a delay of 11-27 milli sec-
onds (ms) between the tremor correlated cortical activity (EEG) and EMG
and the results are reasonably within the range of experimentally observed
value for cortico-muscular transmission [4]. This result, further conﬁrms the
involvement of cortex in the generation of essential tremor [5].

The paper is organised as follows: In section 2, we discuss in detail, the method-
ology of coherence analysis. Then, we extend the coherence analysis for time
delay estimation. Due to a time delay there will be a time misalignment be-
tween the two time series thereby causing a reduction in the coherence esti-
mated between them. In order to compensate for the reduction in coherence
due to delay, we shift one of the time series keeping the other constant and
estimate the coherence as a function of the shift. This method has been suc-
cessfully applied to estimate the time delay between the acoustic source and
the receiving signals [3]. On similar lines, phase synchronisation is used to es-
timate the time delay between and among the atmospheric variables observed
at diﬀerent meteorological sites [6]. In section 3, we apply this method to afore
mentioned theoretical models. After validating the method by the results of
standard models, in section 4, we apply this method to estimate the time delay
between the simultaneously recorded EEG and EMG data of essential tremor
subjects. We discuss the results and conclude in section 5.

2 Methodology

Let x(t) and y(t) be two simultaneously recorded data sets of length N. The
mean and standard deviation of the two data sets are, respectively, set to zero

2

and one. We divide the data sets into M disjoint segments of length L, such
that N = L · M. We calculate power spectra,
Sxy,
d
which is the Fourier transform of the cross-correlation function of the signals
x(t) and y(t) [1], in each segment. Over cap in all the quantities indicates that
it is an estimate of that quantity. Finally, we average the power spectra and
the cross-spectrum across all the segments and calculate coherence as follows
[7],

The coherence spectrum provides the strength of correlation between the two
signals, x(t) and y(t). The conﬁdence limit for coherence at the 100% α is given
by 1 − (1 − α)
(M −1) . Thus, the coherence spectrum is always considered with
this line. In all of our analysis, α is set to 0.99, and hence the conﬁdence limit
is 1 − 0.01
(M −1) . The estimated value of coherence, at a frequency, above this
line indicates (a) signiﬁcant coherence between the two time series at this fre-
quency; (b) the magnitude (deviation of coherence from this line) determines
the degree of linear correlation between the two time series at this frequency.
The estimated value of coherence at a frequency below this line is considered
as the lack of correlation between the two time series at this frequency.

If the sampling frequency of the signals is sf − Hz (i.e. sf number of data
points are sampled per second), then the frequency resolution of the quantities
in eq. 1, is sf
L . Thus, one should optimally choose the value of L depending on
the purpose of analysis, to compromise between the sensitivity and reliability.
Usage of the ﬁxed segment length L is questioned and a variable segment
length is suggested in [8], to make quantitative assessment of the signal. But,
for all practical purposes, a ﬁxed segment length is easily implementable and
hence, it is used in the forthcoming analysis.

While the coherence spectrum provides the strength of correlation between the
two signals x(t) and y(t), time (delay) information between the two signals
can be obtained from the phase spectrum, which is the argument of the cross-
spectrum [1, 7],

[
Φ(ω) = arg{

\Sxy(ω)}.

Following [1], eq. 2 can be further simpliﬁed to see the explicit appearance of
the time delay in it as follows,

Thus, the conﬁdence interval of the phase estimate is inversely related to
coherence. In the rest of the paper we use estimates of the coherence and
phase without the over hat for the sake of convenience.

One of the conventional ways to estimate a time delay, in frequency domain,
is to ﬁt a straight line to the phase spectrum (eq. 3) in the frequency band
of signiﬁcant coherence, as the phase can be reliably estimated only in the
frequency band of signiﬁcant coherence (see eq. 4). This method of estimating
delay is possible when we have a broad band coherence and limits its applica-
bility to the narrow band coherent signals. In some cases, coherence extends
to ﬁrst harmonic and hence the phase values at the harmonics are used to
increase the reliability of the delay estimate [9].

Further, if two time series show signiﬁcant coherence over a wide range of
frequency band, but have a minimal phase relation, then the estimation of time
delay from the phase estimate is not straight forward. Under such conditions,
phase estimate, in addition to the ωδ term (see eq. 3), will also contain a
frequency dependent factor, namely, the argument of the transfer function,
arg A(ω). In such cases, arg A(ω) is estimated by Hilbert transform, and then
delay is estimated from the phase estimate after subtracting the estimated
transfer function from the phase estimate [2]. From the above discussion it is
clear that phase estimates cannot be used to estimate the delay from narrow
band coherent signals which are often observed in human physiological data
[5, 10]. For this purpose, we use the method of maximising coherence.

As discussed in the last part of the introduction, a delay δ between two time
series, will cause a reduction in the estimated coherence between them. In
order to compensate for the reduction in coherence due to delay and thereby to
estimate the delay, we realign the time series by artiﬁcially shifting them. For
this, we shift one of the time series by a lag (τ ) keeping the other constant and
consider coherence at the selected frequency band ω0 as a function of τ , C(τ )ω0
and repeat the same for the other time series. If there is a delay between the
two time series, coherence in the selected frequency band C(τ )ω0 will increase
from its value at τ = 0 and reach a maximum at the τ corresponding to δ. After
shifting one of the time series by a lag τ , the length of the shifted time series
will be less than the un-shifted time series by N − τ (τ in sample units) data
points. We discard the extra data points in the un-shifted time series to have
the same length for both time series. Further, coherence is a relative measure
and changes with the length of the data. It is reﬂected in the 99% conﬁdence
level (see above). For each shift, we discard the points corresponding to the
maximum lag from the entire length of the time series, and consider only

4

the length of the data which is integer multiple of L. By doing so, coherence
C(τ )ω0 calculated for all the lags will have the same conﬁdence level, thereby
conﬁrming that the maximum value of coherence is reached only because of
the delay and not due to the spurious eﬀects caused in estimating coherence
for diﬀerent lengths of data. As we have conﬁdence level as a check for the
reliability of δ, we don’t need any additional tests like, surrogate tests [11] to
assess the reliability of the results. However, in order to get the variability in
the estimated delay, we use surrogate analysis.

Surrogate analysis is introduced in the context of nonlinear time series analysis
to check whether or not the time series under consideration has got a nonlinear
structure [11, 12]. Making the (null) hypothesis that the time series has come
from a linear process, several linear realizations of the time series namely, sur-
rogates, are synthesised. Then, the original time series and the surrogates are
quantiﬁed by a suitable discriminating statistic. Any deviation in the discrimi-
nating statistic calculated for the original time series and surrogates indicates
the presence of nonlinear structure in the original time series and thereby
rejecting the null hypothesis [12]. There are diﬀerent ways of preparing the
surrogates [11, 13]. The misconception of surrogate analysis is discussed in
[14]. As mentioned above, the objective of the methods to generate surrogates
[11, 13] is to synthesise a new data set by destroying the nonlinear structure
present in the original data set. But our aim is not to show the presence of
nonlinear structure in our data. For the purpose of calculating the error-bars
of delay, surrogates are generated by exploiting one of the basic assumptions
of spectral analysis that distinct parts of the time series are independent [7].
Instead of shuﬄing the time series as a whole (which is done in one of the
methods to synthesise surrogates, amplitude adjusted surrogates) we shuﬄe
the disjoint data segments from which the original spectrum is estimated (see
above). We shuﬄe only the un-shifted time series (see above) from which the
information is assumed to ﬂow to the other time series (which is time shifted
in advance in maximising coherence analysis) with a delay. By doing so, the
\Syy(ω) in eq. 1 will remain the same
spectra of both the time series,
\Sxy(ω) in eq. 1 will be diﬀerent. This type of surrogate
but the cross spectrum
is similar to the one proposed in [13] where the whole time series is shuﬄed but
by preserving two point correlation (i.e. power spectrum) of the original time
series. For all the analyses reported in this paper we synthesise 19 diﬀerent
realizations of surrogates. We make a null hypothesis that C(τ )ω0 obtained is
due to spurious correlations between the two time series. For each realization
of surrogate we calculate time delayed coherence C(τ )surr
. We calculate the
signiﬁcance of diﬀerence S(τ ) between the C(τ )surr
calculated for surrogates

\Sxx(ω) and

and C(τ )ω0 where S(τ ) =

erage over diﬀerent realizations of surrogates and σ[.] indicates the standard
deviation between diﬀerent realizations of surrogates. Any value of S(τ ) > 2
indicates that the C(τ )ω0 obtained is not due to spurious correlations [12] and

hence the null hypothesis is rejected. If the null hypothesis is rejected we con-
sider C(τ )ω0 for further analysis otherwise we discard it as spurious correlation.
For the C(τ )ω0 qualiﬁed in the surrogate analysis (for which null hypothesis is
rejected) we calculate the error in the delay in the following way: we subtract
C(τ )surr
calculated for each realization from C(τ )ω0 and calculate delay for
each subtracted function (i.e.) C(τ )ω0 − C(τ )surr
. We report here the delay of
the system as the mean value of the delays (calculated for the 19 surrogate sub-
tracted realizations) and their standard deviation as error-bar. As the increase
in the C(τ )ω0 when compensated for the delay is very small, for the sake of
clarity we plot C ′(τ )ω0 = hC(τ )ω0− < C(τ )surr
>i − [C(ω0)− < C(ω0)surr >].
Note that C(ω0) is the value of C(τ )ω0 at τ = 0 and < C(ω0)surr > is the
average of C(τ )surr
for diﬀerent realizations of the surrogates at τ = 0. By
this deﬁnition C ′(τ )ω0 will pass through a zero value at τ = 0 and show a
maximum value (above zero) at τ = δ (for δ 6= 0) between the processes.
Though we calculate S(τ ) for diﬀerent τ values at which C(τ )ω0 is evaluated,
we report here S(τ = δ) as it is the most relevant one in determining the
signiﬁcance of the C ′(τ = δ)ω0 (and hence C(τ = δ)ω0). Based on the above
arguments the delay between the two time series is given by:

3 Application to coupled R¨ossler attractors

In this section, we apply the method of maximising coherence, to coupled
R¨ossler systems. The dynamics of the i-th attractor is given as follows:

˙xi(t) = −[yi(t) − zi(t)] + ǫj,i xj(t − δ)
˙yi(t) = xi(t) + a yi(t)
˙zi(t) = b + zi(t) [xi(t) + c],

where a = 0.38, b = 0.3, c = 4.5, are the parameters. Coupling is estab-
lished through the x component between the attractors. ǫj,i, is the coupling
constant and xj is the x− component of the j−th attractor. In our study, we
consider the dynamics of two coupled R¨ossler attractors, and hence i = 1
and j = 2 and δ is the delay. Further, we don’t consider the self coupling of
the oscillators.

to 2 sec.

First, we consider the coupling scheme as shown in Fig. 1, where two R¨ossler
attractors are coupled and the information ﬂow is from attractor 2 to attractor
1 (ǫ2,1 = 0.16 and ǫ1,2 = 0) as governed by the above set of equations. δ is
set to 2 sec. The above equations are simulated by Euler scheme with a step
size of 0.01 sec and for the subsequent analysis the data are down sampled
to 0.1 sec. As the coupling is established through the x− component between
the attractors, we use the x− time series to perform the delay estimation. We
have used 30000 data points for further analysis.

Power spectra of the two attractors are shown in Fig 2a. Solid line represents
the power spectrum of attractor 1 and solid line with dots represents the power
spectrum of attractor 2. For the sake of clarity the spectrum of attractor 1 is
shifted vertically upwards by a factor of 5 from its original position. We have
used a segment length of L = 1000 and hence the frequency resolution (of
the quantities in eq. 1) is 0.01 Hz. Spectra show dominant activities in the
frequency range of 0.1 to 0.2 Hz, which can be related to the mean orbital
period of ∼ 5 sec of the attractor [15, 16]. Since the dynamics of the attractor
1 is perturbed by coupling (see Fig. 1), its spectrum looks slightly diﬀerent
from that of the attractor 2. The coherence spectrum of the coupled attractors
is shown in Fig. 2b. Horizontal line around the coherence of 0.15 indicates the
conﬁdence level of α = 0.99.

In the frequency band between 0.1-0.2 Hz (see Fig. 2a), where the individ-
ual attractors show dominant activities, the coupled systems show signiﬁcant
coherence. Estimated phase (eq. 2) between the coupled attractors is shown
in Fig. 2c. Error-bars represent the 95% conﬁdence interval of the phase esti-
mate given by eq. 4. Thus the phase can be reliably estimated in the frequency
band (0.1-0.2 Hz), where the coupled attractors show a signiﬁcant coherence
(see Fig. 2b). The result of maximising coherence is shown in Fig. 2d where
C ′(τ )ω0 is plotted as a function of lag τ . We have chosen ω0 = 0.13Hz (and
is shown in Fig. 2b) from the basic frequency of the oscillators. Solid line at
C ′(τ )ω0 = 0 indicates C(ω0)− < C(ω0)surr >(see the last part of the method-
ology for details). Negative shift indicates that the time series of attractor 1
is in advance and positive shift indicates that the time series of attractor 2 is
in advance. Since there is a delay of 2 sec, the coherence calculated at τ = 0
is zero (see above). In order to compensate for the reduction in the coherence
and thereby to estimate the time delay, time series of the attractors are shifted
by a time lag τ . As the delayed information ﬂows from attractor 2 to attractor
1, coherence C ′(τ )ω0 increases from zero (see above) when the time series of
attractor 1 is shifted back in time and reaches a maximum at the τ = −2.1
which is the time delay between the two time series (δ used in the simulation
is 2 sec). The signiﬁcance of deviation from the surrogate data S(−2.1) is
2.24 and indicates that C ′(τ = −2.1) is not due to spurious correlations. The
error-bar for the delay (as explained in the methodology section) is calculated
as 0.4 sec. Thus, the time delay δ is −2.1 ± 0.4 sec and is well captured by

7

the maximising coherence analysis (expected delay value is 2 sec for the ﬂow
from attractor 2 to attractor 1).

is indicated along with its coherence value C(ω0). (c). Phase estimate Φ(ω) of the

C ′(τ )ω0 = 0 indicates C(ω0)− < C(ω0)surr >. < . > represents the average over

of -2.1 sec (from attractor 2 to 1), and the expected value of δ is 2 sec for the ﬂow
from attractor 2 to attractor 1. The signiﬁcance of deviation from the surrogate
S(−2.1) is 2.24 and indicates that C ′(τ )ω0 is not due to spurious correlations.

Next, we consider the coupling scheme as shown in Fig. 3, where two R¨ossler
attractors are coupled as considered above, but with a bi-directional ﬂow,

8

ǫ2,1 = 0.15 and ǫ1,2 = 0.1. δ used in the coupling is same as in Fig. 1, which is
2 sec.

2 

Fig. 3. Coupling scheme of the attractors 1 and 2. ǫ2,1 = 0.15 and ǫ1,2 = 0.1. δ is
set to 2 sec.

Power spectra of the attractors look almost the same as the two attractors
perturb each other almost to the same extent (see Fig. 4a). As obtained for
uni-directional coupling, in this case also, signiﬁcant coherence is between 0.1-
0.2 Hz (Fig. 4b). As the number of data points used is the same (30000) as in
the uni-directional coupling, the conﬁdence level α = 0.99 is also around the
coherence of 0.15 (see the horizontal line in Fig. 4 b which is same as in Fig.
2b). Phase estimate of the bi-directionally coupled systems is shown in Fig. 4c
with the 95 % conﬁdence interval as the error-bars. Error-bars are relatively
narrow (see eq. 4) in the frequency band of 0.1-0.2 Hz where signiﬁcant co-
herence is observed (as seen in Fig. 2c). Result of the maximising coherence
for bi-directionally coupled systems is shown in Fig. 4d. The horizontal line
at C ′(τ )ω0 = 0 has the meaning as in Fig. 2d. In this case 0.15 Hz is used as
ω0 (and is shown in Fig. 4b) which is the basic frequency of the attractors.
C ′(τ )ω0 shows two maxima, one at τ = −2.5 sec which corresponds to the ﬂow
from attractor 2 to 1 and another at τ = 1.7 sec which corresponds to the
ﬂow from attractor 1 to 2, while the δ used in the coupling is 2 sec in both
directions (see Fig. 4d). Also, in this case, the signiﬁcance of deviation from
surrogate calculated by S(τ ) at τ values -2.5 sec and 1.7 sec are well above
2 (see Fig. 4d) indicating that the C ′(τ )ω0 obtained at these two τ values
are not due to spurious correlations. Thus, the time delays of the system are
−2.5 ± 0.5 sec (for the ﬂow from attractor 2 to attractor 1) and 1.7 ± 0.4 sec
(for the ﬂow from attractor 1 to attractor 2) and are well within the expected
value of 2 sec in either direction (see Fig. 3). The error-bars are obtained by
surrogate analysis.

Fig. 4. (a-c). Explanations are as in Fig. 2 but for bi-directionally coupled R¨ossler
attractors, ǫ2,1 = 0.15 and ǫ1,2 = 0.1. (d). Result of maximising coherence C ′(τ )ω0.
C ′(τ )ω0 has reached maximum value at two places, one at -2.5 sec (from attractor 2
to 1) and another at 1.7 sec (from attractor 1 to 2), where δ is set to 2 sec in both
directions. The signiﬁcance of deviation from surrogate at S(−2.5) is 6.60 and at
S(1.7) is 3.25 and indicates that C ′(τ ) at τ values -2.5 sec and 1.7 sec are not due
to spurious correlations. The horizontal line at C ′(τ )ω0 = 0 has the same meaning
as in Fig. 2d.

Results of the theoretically coupled systems are summarised in Fig. 5. For
the unidirectional ﬂow, shown in Fig. 1, which is referred to as scenario 1 in
Fig. 5, the value of the delay obtained by maximising coherence, shown by ’∗’
with the error-bars (calculated by surrogate analysis) shown as vertical line,
is close to the expected value of -2 sec (shown as dot in Fig. 5). Similarly
for the bi-directional ﬂow (see Fig. 3) which is referred to as scenario 2 in
Fig. 5, the values of the delay obtained by maximising coherence with their
error-bars (vertical lines) are close to the expected delay of 2 sec in either
direction (see Fig. 3). Compared to the unidirectional ﬂow, the results of
the bi-directionally coupled oscillators show slightly more deviations from the
expected value of 2 sec but when we include the error-bar, they are close to
the expected value. So when dealing with the biological systems we should

consider the delay always with the error-bar before we draw any conclusion
from it. For the uni-directionally coupled oscillators there is no signiﬁcant
change in the result when ω0 is chosen as 0.19 Hz where there is a signiﬁcant
coherence between the two oscillators. Further for the above studied systems
similar results can be obtained by cross-correlation analysis and by the time
delayed phase synchronisation analysis as well [6].

4 Application to EEG and EMG data

Tremor is an involuntary, periodic movement of the parts of the body [17]. It
can be classiﬁed as normal and pathological tremor depending on amplitude
and the conditions under which tremor is activated [17]. Essential tremor
is a common movement disorder characterised mostly by postural tremor of
the arms. Other neurological abnormalities are typically absent in essential
tremor [18]. It has been shown by experimental studies in animals [19, 20] and
by Positron emission tomography or functional magnetic resonance imaging
studies [21–23] on human beings, that diﬀerent parts of the brain are involved
in essential tremor. The correlation between the thalamic activity and forearm
electromyogram provides a direct evidence for the involvement of the thalamus

11

in the tremor oscillations [24]. Further, control of essential tremor by stereo-
tactic lesions and high frequency stimulation of the ventrolateral thalamus
adds support for the involvement of thalamus in the mechanism of essential
tremor [25, 26]. As the cerebellum has its main outputs to thalamus which in
turn has strong projections to cortex, it is hypothesised that essential tremor
arise from an oscillating cerebello-thalamo-cortical loop the output station of
which is the motor cortex [5].

Cortico-muscular coherence for essential tremor has been studied earlier [27]
but has not been ascertained at the tremor frequency in [27]. We show below
that there is a signiﬁcant cortico-muscular coherence when the signal to noise
ratio of the tremor increases beyond a certain threshold value as seen in [5,
28]. Since the paper is aimed at time delay estimation, the detailed results
and discussion of the spectral analysis of the tremor study will be reported
elsewhere [10].

For this purpose we consider ﬁve patients (with mean age 66 years and stan-
dard deviation 5.1 years), which showed postural essential tremor of the arms.
In a dimly lighted room, patients are asked to sit on a comfortable chair
in a slightly supine position with both hands held against gravity while the
forearms are supported. EEG is recorded with a 64-channel EEG system (Neu-
roscan) with standard electrode positions [29]. Surface EMG is recorded from
EMG electrodes attached to wrist ﬂexors and extensors of both arms. For all
the subjects EEG and EMG are sampled at a rate of 1000 Hz. EEG and
EMG are bandpass ﬁltered online, respectively, between 0.01-200 Hz and 30-
200 Hz. Data are stored in a computer and are analysed oﬄine. In all the
cases EMG is recorded on both hands. Each recording lasted for 1-4 minutes.
Artifacts like base line shift, eye blinks etc. are discarded by visual inspection.

Before further analysis, EMG signals are full wave rectiﬁed (magnitude of the
deviations from mean) and EEG is made reference free by constructing the
second (spatial) derivative, (Laplacian) [30, 31]. We discuss in detail for one of
the subjects, subject 1, which we feel typical and for the remaining subjects
we summarise the results in a table.

For subject 1, the power spectra of EEG (solid line) and EMG (solid line with
dots), see Fig. 6a, are calculated with L = 1000 and hence the frequency reso-
lution is 1 Hz (since sf = 1000 Hz). In Fig. 6a, we show the power spectra of
one of the EEG channels (C4) in the contralateral (right) side to tremor (left)
hand and the rectiﬁed EMG (extensor muscle) of the same hand. Power spec-
trum of EEG (shown as solid line in Fig. 6a) is shifted vertically upwards by a
factor of 10 from its initial position for the sake of clarity. Power spectrum of
EEG shows dominant activity in a broad band between 8-20 Hz containing the
bands of 10-13 Hz and 15-20 Hz, which correspond, respectively, to the alpha
and beta activity of the brain [32]. Muscle spectrum (solid line with dots in Fig.
6a) shows tremor activity around 5 Hz. Correlation between the muscle and
C4 (the central electrode overlaying the primary motor cortex, PMC) of EEG
cannot be guessed from the EEG spectrum as there is no signiﬁcant activity
around 5 Hz (tremor frequency). Correlation becomes clear when we consider
coherence. Figure 6b shows coherence between C4 and extensor muscle. The
horizontal line around the coherence of 0.024 indicates the conﬁdence level of
α = 0.99. There is a signiﬁcant coherence (and hence correlation) between C4
and the tremor activity reﬂected by the muscle [5, 28, 33–36] and also in the

13

frequency band of 10-15 Hz. Phase estimate of this system is given in Fig. 6c
with 95% conﬁdence interval as error-bars. It is clear from Fig. 6c that phase
can be reliably estimated at the (tremor and the signiﬁcant coherence) fre-
quency of 5 Hz (conﬁdence interval is narrow) and also in the frequency band
of 10-15 Hz. In an earlier study Hellwig et al. [28] investigated time delays
[
Φ(ω) at the tremor frequency.
based on the value of the phase estimate
But the results obtained [28] are not in the interpretable level. The reason
postulated in [28] that the delay might be modulated by frequency dependent
mechanism is hardly conceivable in a narrow (single) frequency band at which
phase estimate is signiﬁcant. The reason may be due to the weak assumption
[
Φ(ω) = ωδ + θ, where θ is the indispensable constant [33, 34],
of the model
phase shift between the two processes which is ignored in [28]. However, we
show below that the delay estimated by maximising coherence is reasonably
in good agreement with the experimentally observed conduction velocity and
is in physiologically interpretable range.

Application of the maximising coherence method to real life data like EEG
is not straight forward. Since the maximising coherence method is aimed at
to capture the time delay (by making up for the reduction in the coherence)
by artiﬁcially shifting (local dynamics) the time series, it is very sensitive
to non-stationarities in the time series. However, in order to make coherence
analysis robust against non-stationarities within the time series, we use the
following way to discard the non-stationary parts of the data: We calculate
autocorrelation function [37], in each of the segments (of length 1000 samples).
Then the de-correlation time, time at which autocorrelation function falls to
exp(−1) (as the ﬁrst value of autocorrelation function is 1 by deﬁnition) [37]
is calculated for all the segments. Non-stationarities due to base line shift,
eye blinks will introduce artiﬁcial trends (lifting up of the mean value of the
signal) [38] in the signal, which will have higher de-correlation time than the
stationary parts of the signal. In order to discard the non-stationary parts,
about 50 % of the median of the de-correlation time calculated in all the
segments is taken as threshold and parts of the EEG and EMG data with
de-correlation time greater than the above deﬁned threshold are discarded in
the delay estimation. After discarding the non-stationary parts of the data,
the segments left out on either side of the removed parts are stitched as if
they are recorded continously. Of course, care should be taken in applying the
above method. The above method will capture only the non-stationary parts
if it is applied to the data of low signal to noise ratio which can be avoided by
visual inspection of the data.

Result of the delay estimation between C4 and muscle, is shown in Fig. 6d.
The horizontal line at C ′(τ )ω0 = 0 in Fig. 6d has the same meaning as in Fig.
2d. Here, we have used ω0 = 5 Hz (see Fig. 6b), where signiﬁcant coherence is
observed. Negative shift indicates that the time series of EEG is in advance. In

14

Fig. 6d, C ′(τ )ω0 reaches a maximum value at τ = 16 ms, indicating the cortex
(time series of EMG is in advance for positive values of τ ) is driving the tremor.
The signiﬁcance of deviation from the surrogate is given by S(16) = 13.01 and
indicates that C ′(τ )ω0 obtained is not due to spurious correlations. The error-
bar obtained by surrogate analysis is 7 ms and hence the delay obtained for
C4 is 16±7 ms which is in good agreement with the experimentally observed
value of around 15 ms [4]. Comparison of Fig. 6d with Fig. 2d, shows that
the information ﬂow is in one direction (i.e.) from cortex to muscle. But in
other subjects, in (an electrode from) this region, we have also observed a
bi-directional ﬂow, a situation similar to Fig. 4d.

to record EEG. Electrodes on the left hand side are odd numbered and those on
the right hand side are even numbered. (b). Isocoherence map of the subject 1,
constructed by considering the coherence at the tremor frequency (5 Hz in this
case). Magnitude of the coherence is indicated by the gray scale-bar juxtaposed to
the isocoherence map. Parts of the scalp which showed signiﬁcant coherence are
coloured black and the conﬁdence level of α = 0.99 is marked with white colour
(which is set to zero, see text for details). (Electrodes O5-O6 are just displayed and
are not used for coherence analysis).

Of the 64-channels of EEG recorded, coherence and delay estimation are ex-
plained in detail for C4, as it is overlaying the primary sensorimotor cortex
which is involved in motor control of the contralateral hand aﬀected by essen-
tial tremor. For the rest of the electrodes (see Fig. 7a) we give the results of the
coherence analysis as isocoherence (region of scalp with same coherence) map.
Electrodes on the boundary of the scalp are not considered for the analysis as
they had low signal to noise ratio. Further, we have not used the electrodes
O5 - O6 for the study. To construct isocoherence map, we have considered
the coherence C(ω) at the (tremor) frequency of 5 Hz for all the thirty ﬁve
channels (see above) shown in Fig. 7a, from F5 (top left of scalp, Fig. 7a), to
P6 (bottom right of scalp, Fig. 7a). We have subtracted the conﬁdence level
(α = 0.99) from the coherence so that the conﬁdence level for coherence is
zero. In Fig. 7b, surface of the scalp exhibiting signiﬁcant coherence is marked

15

with black colour and the coherence of the parts which do not cross the con-
ﬁdence level of α = 0.99 (which are set to zero after the above normalisation)
are marked with white colour. In Fig. 7b, C4 shows maximum coherence, (see
the gray scale-bar juxtaposed to Fig. 7b). Thus, there is a hot spot (region of
signiﬁcant coherence) in the PMC region. Similar results have been obtained
in the spectral study of essential tremor [5, 28].

There is another hot spot for subject 1 in the frontal region of the scalp (FCZ).
The detailed discussion of this will be dealt with in [10].

The horizontal line at C ′(τ )ω0 = 0 in Fig. 8 (a-f) has the same meaning as in Fig.
2d. The signiﬁcance of deviation from the surrogate S(τ ) at τ = δ is given in all
the plots. Estimated values of delay by maximising coherence are (c) -28 ms (d) -2
∼ 0 ms (e) -30 ms and 31 ms (f) 25 ms. As the maximum of C ′(τ )ω0 = 25 ms in
Fig. 8f is not clearly discernable (see text for details) it is magniﬁed in the inset
shown in Fig. 8f. Negative shift indicates that the time series of EEG is in advance
and positive shift indicates that the time series of EMG is in advance. A negative
delay indicates the ﬂow from muscle to EEG and a positive delay indicates the ﬂow
from EEG to muscle. C2 and C6 do not qualify in the surrogate analysis as their
S(τ = δ) values lie below 2 indicating that the values of C ′(τ )ω0 (see Fig. 8a and
8b) obtained for these two electrodes are due to spurious correlations and therefore
are not considered for further analysis.

Spectral and delay estimations for C4 and extensor muscle have been analysed
in detail showing a uni-directional ﬂow from PMC to muscle, with a delay of 16
ms. For the rest of the electrodes (C2, C6, CP2, CP4, CP6) of the central hot
spot and FCZ of the frontal hot spot, the results of delay estimation are given
in Fig. 8. The signiﬁcance of deviation from surrogate S(τ ) at τ = δ is given
in all the plots, see Fig. 8(a-f). For C2 (Fig. 8a) and C6 (Fig. 8b) the value of
S(τ = δ) is below two indicating that the values of C ′(τ )ω0 obtained for these
two electrodes are due to spurious correlations. Therefore we do not consider
them for further analysis. For CP2, CP4, CP6 and FCZ, S(τ = δ) values
obtained are above 2 (see Fig. 8(c-f)) indicating that C ′(τ )ω0 values obtained
for these electrodes are not due to spurious correlations. Delay values exhibited
by C(τ )ω0 shown in Fig. 8(c-f) are CP2 -28 ± 3.3 ms (see Fig. 8c), CP4, -2 ∼
0 ms (see Fig. 8d), CP6 -30 ± 7.4 and 31 ± 13.5 ms (see Fig. 8e) and FCZ
25 ± 10.4 ms (see Fig. 8f). The maximum in C ′(25)ω0 for FCZ shown in Fig.
8f is not clearly discernable and hence this region is magniﬁed in the inset
shown in Fig. 8f where the maximum at τ = 25 ms can be seen without any
ambiguity. The large ﬂuctuations in C ′(τ )ω0 for FCZ (Fig. 8f) and C4 (Fig. 6d)
indicate larger uncertainty in the delay estimated by this method and is one
of the shortcomings of this method. However, this uncertainty, to some extent
is revealed by the error-bars (see above) obtained by the surrogate analysis.
A positive value of τ indicates that the time series of muscle is in advance
and a negative value of τ indicates that the time series of EEG is in advance.
Error-bars are obtained by surrogate analysis as discussed in the methodology
section. A zero delay for CP4 (see Fig. 8d) may be due to the nulliﬁcation
of two strong counter acting forces (drive from PMC to muscle and opposing
drive from muscle to PMC, a situation similar to phase locking in coupled
oscillators). The positive values of estimated delays including the error-bars
are well in agreement with the experimentally observed value of 15 ms for
forearm muscles [4]. For the negative delay (ﬂow from muscle to EEG), it is at
least partly in keeping with normal median Somatosensory Evoked Potential
(SEP) latencies of around 20 ms.

Further, in order to make the delay statistically signiﬁcant we report the de-
lay of the hot spot as a whole as the delay of the system, by weighting the
delay obtained for each electrode (when it is qualiﬁed in surrogate analysis)
by a fraction of the coherence C(ω0) value that each electrode contributes to
the hot spot. By doing so, electrodes showing higher tremor related correla-
tions will contribute more to the delay of the system. For subject 1, there
is a hot spot (central hot spot) in the PMC region of scalp and another in
the frontal region of the scalp (i.e.) FCZ (see Fig. 7b). Of the electrodes con-
tributing to the central hot spot, we do not consider C2 and C6 (as they do
not qualify in the surrogate analysis) for further analysis. We weight the de-
lay obtained for rest of the electrodes contributing to the central hot spot by

Further, in the calculation of NC (l)(ω0) for positive delay, only those elec-
trodes which display positive delay are considered and similarly for negative
delay, only those electrodes which display negative delay are considered. For
subject 1, only one electrode, FCZ contributes to the frontal hot spot, for
which NC (l)(ω0) = 1. We have normalised the error-bars of the delays in a
similar way. The ﬁnal values of delay for both the hot spots are given in Table
1 along with the delay values obtained by maximising coherence analysis for
four other subjects.

Of the ﬁve subjects considered three show an additional hot spot in the frontal
region the delay values of which are also given in Table 1 (see third column). As
can be seen there is also a cortico-muscular delay between the frontal hot spot
and the periphery in all three cases. However, this delay is about double the
cortico-muscular delay from the central hot spot. These results indicate that
both the central area most likely corresponding to the primary sensorimotor
cortex and more frontal area are involved in the generation of essential tremor.
While the delays from the central area (PMC) between 11 and 16 ms are in
keeping with a direct transmission through fast conducting pyramidal path-
ways [4] the cortico-muscular delay from the more frontal area rather indicates
another way of interaction with the periphery. Thus the method of maximis-
ing coherence is capable of distinguishing diﬀerent types of cortico-muscular
interactions which are relevant to the understanding of the pathophysiology
of essential tremor, for details see [10] . The musculo-cortical delays partly
agree but are generally slightly lower than the somatosensory conduction de-
lays known from routine SEP studies and most likely reﬂect feed back of the

18

peripheral tremor to the cortex.

5 Conclusion

We have used the method of maximising coherence to obtain the time delay
between two series. As a test case, we applied this method to uni- and bi-
directionally coupled R¨ossler attractors. In both cases, the delays estimated
by maximising coherence match well with the expected values, within the er-
ror limits which are obtained by surrogate analysis. For EEG-EMG time series
of essential tremor subjects, this method yields a delay in the range of 11 to
16 ms for the primary sensorimotor area and 23-27 ms for the more frontal
area involved in the tremor oscillation whereas the experimentally observed
value of the conduction time between primary cortex and muscle is 15 ± 2
ms [4]. The larger delay observed for the frontal area may indicate a diﬀerent,
possibly indirect interaction with the periphery. The musculo-cortical delays
(9 to 24 ms) are partly in keeping with the delay observed (around 20 ms)
in SEP studies. One of the reasons for the slight deviation of the delay from
experimentally observed value may be as follows: We have employed maximis-
ing coherence method to capture the delay between two series, assuming that
there will be a continuous delayed ﬂow of information from one time series to
another. But, it may not be the case in biological data like EEG and EMG.
Intermittently the ﬂow may be absent. One way to check out this is to divide
the time series into small sub-portions and calculate the time delay in each
portion. But coherence analysis needs at least a minimum of 30000 data points
to decide statistically whether or not the two time series under study are lin-
early correlated. So we need to analyse the nature of information ﬂows using
the nonlinear methods like extended Granger causality [39], transfer entropy
[40]. This issue will be addressed in our future work. Of course other methods
like cross-correlation analysis and time delayed phase synchronisation anal-
ysis [6] can be used to estimate the delay between the EEG and EMG of
the essential tremor subjects. But the problems in using cross-correlation are
addressed in [1] and references therein. There exists an analytical expression
for the conﬁdence limit for coherence estimate but this is lacking for phase
synchronisation used in [6]. That is the reason why phase synchronisation is
not commonly used for correlation analysis (subsequently for delay analysis in
this work) though this method is expected to be superior to coherence anal-
ysis [41]. However comparison of the diﬀerent methods of delay estimation is
beyond the scope of the current paper.

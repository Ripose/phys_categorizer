Analytic Conﬁdence Level Calculations using
the Likelihood Ratio and Fourier Transform

Hongbo Hu and Jason Nielsen1
University of Wisconsin-Madison, Wisconsin, USA

Abstract

The interpretation of new particle search results involves a con-
ﬁdence level calculation on either the discovery hypothesis or the
background-only (“null”) hypothesis. A typical approach uses toy
Monte Carlo experiments to build an expected experiment estimator
distribution against which an observed experiment’s estimator may
be compared. In this note, a new approach is presented which calcu-
lates analytically the experiment estimator distribution via a Fourier
transform, using the likelihood ratio as an ordering estimator. The
analytic approach enjoys an enormous speed advantage over the toy
Monte Carlo method, making it possible to quickly and precisely cal-
culate conﬁdence level results.

1 Introduction

A consistently recurring topic at LEP2 has been the interpretation and com-
bination of results from searches for new particles. The fundamental task is
to interpret the collected dataset in the context of two complementary hy-
potheses. The ﬁrst hypothesis – the null hypothesis – is that the dataset is
compatible with non-signal Standard Model background production alone,
and the second is that the dataset is compatible with the sum of signal and
Standard Model background production. In most cases, the search for new
particles proceeds via several parallel searches for ﬁnal states. The results
from all of these subchannels are then combined to produce a ﬁnal result.

All existing conﬁdence level calculations follow the same general strat-
egy [1, 2, 3]. A test statistic or estimator is constructed to quantify the
“signal-ness” of a real or simulated experiment. The “signal-ness” of a single
observed experiment leads to the conﬁdence level on, for example, the null
hypothesis that the observed experiment is incompatible with signal and
background both being produced. Most calculation methods use an ensem-
ble of toy Monte Carlo experiments to generate the estimator distribution
against which the observed experiment is compared. This generation can be
rather time-consuming when the number of toy Monte Carlo experiments is
great (as it must be for high precision calculations) or if the number of signal
and background expected for each experiment is great (as it is for the case
of searches optimized to use background subtraction).

In this note, we present an improved method for calculating conﬁdence
levels in the context of searches for new particles. Speciﬁcally, when the
likelihood ratio is used as an estimator, the experiment estimator distribu-
tion may be calculated analytically with the Fourier transform. With this
approach, the disadvantage of toy Monte Carlo experiments is avoided. The
analytic method oﬀers several advantages over existing methods, the most
dramatic of which is the increase in calculation speed and precision.

2 Likelihood ratio estimator for searches

The likelihood ratio estimator is the ratio of the probabilities of observing an
event under two search hypotheses. The estimator for a single experiment is

E = C Ls+b
Lb

.

1

(1)

Here

Ls+b is the probability density function for signal+background ex-
periments and
Lb is the probability density function for background-only
experiments. Because the constant factor C appears in each event’s estima-
tor, it does not aﬀect the ordering of the estimators – an event cannot become
more signal-like by choosing a diﬀerent C. For clarity in this note, the con-
stant is chosen to be es, where s is the expected number of signal events. 1
For the simplest case of event counting with no discriminant variables (or,
equivalently, with perfectly non-discriminating variables), the estimator can
be calculated with Poisson probabilities alone. In practice, not every event
is equally signal-like. Each search may have one or more event variables that
discriminate between signal-like and background-like events. For the gen-
eral case, the probabilities
Lb are functions of the observed events’
measured variables.
As an example, consider a search using one discriminant variable m, the
reconstructed Higgs mass. The signal and background have diﬀerent proba-
bility density functions of m, deﬁned as fs(m) and fb(m), respectively. (For
searches with more than one discriminant variable, m is replaced by a vector
of discriminant variables −→x .) It is then straightforward to calculate
Ls+b
and
Lb for a single event, taking into account the event weighting coming
from the discriminant variables:

Ls+b and

E = es Ps+b
Pb

= es e−(s+b) [sfs(m) + bfb(m)]

.

e−b [bfb(m)]

(2)

The likelihood ratio estimator can be shown to maximize the discovery
potential and exclusion potential of a search for new particles [3]. Such
an estimator, both with and without discriminant variables, has been used
successfully by the LEP2 collaborations to calculate conﬁdence levels for
searches [2, 3].

3 Ensemble estimator distributions via Fast

Fourier Transform (FFT)

One way to form an estimator for an ensemble of events is to generate a large
number of toy Monte Carlo experiments, each experiment having a number of

expected signal s is uniquely determined by the cross section. If the cross section is not
ﬁxed, then es is not constant, and C may be set to unity.

events generated from a Poisson distribution. Another way is to analytically
compute the probability density function of the ensemble estimator given the
probability density function of the event estimator. The discussion of this
section pursues the latter approach.

The likelihood ratio estimator is a multiplicative estimator. This means
the estimator for an ensemble of events is formed by multiplying the indi-
vidual event estimators. Alternatively, the logarithms of the estimators may
be summed. In the following derivation, F = ln E, where E is the likelihood
ratio estimator.

For an experiment with 0 events observed, the estimator is trivial:
E = es e−(s+b)
F = 0
ρ0(F ) = δ(F ),

e−b = 1

where ρ0(F ) is the probability density function of F for experiments with 0
observed events.

For an experiment with exactly one event, the estimator is, again using

the reconstructed Higgs mass m,

E = es e−(s+b) [sfs(m) + bfb(m)]

,

e−b [bfb(m)]
sfs(m) + bfb(m)
bfb(m)

,

F = ln

and the probability density function of F is deﬁned as ρ1(F ).

For an experiment with exactly two events, the estimators of the two
events are multiplied to form an event estimator. If the reconstructed Higgs
masses of the two events are m1 and m2, then

E =

[sfs(m1) + bfb(m1)] [sfs(m2) + bfb(m2)]
[bfb(m1)] [bfb(m2)]

F = ln

sfs(m1) + bfb(m1)
bfb(m1)

+ ln

sfs(m2) + bfb(m2)
bfb(m2)

.

The probability density function for exactly two particles ρ2(F ) is simply the
convolution of ρ1(F ) with itself:

ρ2(F ) =

ρ1(F1)ρ1(F2)δ(F

Next, the convolution of ρ1(F ) is rendered manageable by an application

of the relationship between the convolution and the Fourier transform.

If A(F ) = B(F )

C(F ), then the Fourier transforms of A, B, and C

satisfy

⊗

A(G) = B(G)

C(G).

(16)

This allows the convolution to be expressed as a simple power:

ρn(G) =

Note this equation holds even for n = 0, since ρ0(G) = 1. For any practi-
cal computation, the analytic Fourier transform can be approximated by a
numerical Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [4].

(17)

.

How does this help to determine ρs+b and ρb? The probability density
function for an experiment estimator with s expected signal and b expected
background events is

ρs+b(F ) =

e−(s+b) (s + b)n

ρn(F ),

where n is the number of events observed in the experiment. Upon Fourier

ρs+b(G) = e(s+b)[ρ1(G)−1]

(21)

The function ρs+b(F ) may then be recovered by using the inverse transform.
In general, this relation holds for any multiplicative estimator.

This ﬁnal relation means that the probability density function for an ar-
bitrary number of expected signal and background events can be calculated
analytically once the probability density function of the estimator is known
for a single event. This calculation is therefore just as fast for high back-
ground searches as for low background searches. In particular, it holds great
promise for Higgs searches which, due to use of background subtraction and
discriminant variables, are optimized to higher background levels than they
have been in the past.

Two examples will provide practical proof of the principle. For the ﬁrst,
assume a hypothetical estimator results in a probability density function of
simple Gaussian form

ρ1(F ) =

(22)

where σ = 0.2 and µ = 2.0. For an expected s + b = 20.0, both the FFT
method and the toy Monte Carlo method are used to evolute the event es-
timator probability density function to an experiment estimator probabil-
ity density function. The agreement between the two methods (Fig. 1) is
striking. The higher precision of the FFT method is apparent, even when
compared to 1 million toy Monte Carlo experiments. The periodic struc-
ture is due to the discontinuous Poisson distribution being convolved with

ln E = 0 corresponds to the probability that exactly zero events be observed
(e−(s+b) = 2.1
10−9). The precision of the toy Monte Carlo method is lim-
ited by the number of Monte Carlo experiments, while the precision of the
FFT method is limited only by computer precision.

The variable used here is the reconstructed Higgs mass of the event. This
estimator’s probability density function is then calculated for an experiment
with s = 5 and b = 3 expected events (Fig. 2). Again, the two methods agree
well in regions where the toy Monte Carlo method is useful.

These examples support the mathematical proof of the FFT method de-
scribed above. Because the ﬁnal calculations cs+b and cb are simply integrals
of the experiment estimator probability density function, any conﬁdence lev-
els calculated with the FFT method and the toy Monte Carlo method are
identical. The examples also show the precision achievable with the FFT
method, a precision that will be important when testing discovery hypothe-
ses at the 5σ = 5

10−7 level.

4 Combining results from several searches

Given the multiplicative properties of the likelihood ratio estimator, the com-
bination of several search channels proceeds intuitively. The estimator for
any combination of events is simply the product of the individual event es-
timators. Consequently, construction of the estimator probability density
function for the combination of channels parallels the construction of the es-
timator probability density function for the combination of events in a single
channel. In particular, for a combination with N search channels:

ρs+b(G) =

ρj
s+b(G)

N

j=1
Y

P

= e

N
j=1(sj +bj)
h

ρj
1(G)−1
i

(23)

(24)

Due to the strictly multiplicative nature of the estimator, this combina-
tion method is internally consistent. No matter how subsets of the combina-
tions are rearranged (i.e., combining channels in diﬀerent orders, combining
diﬀerent subsets of data runs), the result of the combination does not change.
Once a results are obtained for ρs+b(F ) and ρb(F ), simple integration
gives the conﬁdence coeﬃcients cs+b and cb. From this point, conﬁdence
levels for the two search hypotheses may be calculated in a number of ways
[2, 5, 6]. Those straightforward calculations are outside the scope of this
note.

5 Final remarks and conclusions

A few short remarks conclude this note and emphasize the advantages of
calculations using the likelihood ratio with the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
method.

1. The likelihood ratio estimator is an optimal ordering estimator for max-
imizing both discovery and exclusion potential. Such an estimator can
only improve the discovery or exclusion potential of a search.

2. As a multiplicative estimator, the likelihood ratio estimator ensures
internal consistency when results are combined. For example, if the
dataset is split into several smaller pieces, the combined result always
remains the same.

→

3. The probability density function of an ensemble estimator may be cal-
culated analytically from the event estimator probability density func-
tion. Avoiding toy Monte Carlo generation brings revolutionary ad-
vances in speed and precision. For a HZ
4-jets search with 25
expected background events, a full conﬁdence level calculation with
218 toy MC experiments and 60 Higgs mass hypotheses takes approx-
imately ﬁfteen CPU hours. By contrast, the same calculation using
the FFT method takes approximately two CPU minutes. This dis-
crepancy only increases as the required conﬁdence level precision and
the number of toy MC experiments increase. For example, conﬁdence
(108) toy
level calculations for discovery at the 5σ level would require
MC experiments. Given the approximately linear scaling of calculating
time with number of toy experiments, such a calculation would take up
almost a year in the 4-jet channel alone! The precision of the analytic
FFT method is more than suﬃcient for a 5σ discovery.

O

A fast conﬁdence level calculation makes possible studies that might have
otherwise been too CPU-intensive with the toy MC method. These include
studies of improvements in the event selections, of various working points,
and of systematic errors and their eﬀects, among others. A precise calcu-
lation makes possible rejection of null hypotheses at the level necessary for
discovery.

The marriage of the likelihood ratio estimator and the FFT method seems
well-suited for producing extremely fast and precise conﬁdence level results,
and the ﬂexibility and ease of use of the clfft package should make this a
powerful tool in interpreting searches for new particles.

Abstract

We extend the method of recurrence plots to cross recurrence plots (CRP) which

enables a nonlinear analysis of bivariate data. To quantify CRPs, we introduce three

measures of complexity mainly basing on diagonal structures in CRPs. The CRP

analysis of prototypical model systems with nonlinear interactions demonstrates

that this technique enables to ﬁnd these nonlinear interelations from bivariate time

series, whereas linear correlation tests do not. Applying the CRP analysis to clima-

tological data, we ﬁnd a complex relationship between rainfall and El Ni˜no data.

1 Introduction

A major task in bi- or multivariate data analysis is to compare or to ﬁnd in-

terrelations in diﬀerent time series. Often, these data are gained from natural

systems, which show generally nonstationary and complex behaviour. Further-

more, these systems are often observed by very few measurements providing

short data series. Linear approaches of time series analysis are often not suf-

ﬁcient to analyse this kind of data. In the last two decades a great variety of

nonlinear techniques has been developed to analyse data of complex systems

(cf. [1,2]). Most popular are methods to estimate fractal dimensions, Lyapunov

exponents or mutual information [2–5]. However, most of these methods need

long data series. The uncritical application of these methods especially to

natural data often leads to pitfalls.

To overcome the diﬃculties with nonstationary and rather short data series,

the method of recurrence plots (RP) has been introduced [6–8]. An additional

quantitative analysis of recurrence plots has been developed to detect transi-

tions (e. g. bifurcation points) in complex systems [9–12]. An extension of the

method of recurrence plots to cross recurrence plots enables to investigate the

time dependent behaviour of two processes which are both recorded in a single

time series [13,14]. The basic idea of this approach is to compare the phase

space trajectories of two processes in the same phase space. The aim of this

work is to introduce new measures of complexity, which are based on cross

recurrence plots and to evaluate the similarity of the considered systems. This

nonlinear approach enables to identify epochs where there are linear and even

nonlinear interrelations between both systems.

Firstly, we give an overview about recurrence plots, than we introduce cross

recurrence plots and deﬁne new measures of complexity. Lastly, we apply the

method to two model systems and to natural data.

2 Recurrence Plot

The recurrence plot (RP) is a tool in order to visualize the dynamics of phase

space trajectories and was ﬁrstly introduced by Eckmann et al. [7]. Following

Takens’ embedding theorem [15], the dynamics can be appropriately presented

2

by a reconstruction of the phase space trajectory ~x(t) from a time series uk

(with a sampling time ∆t) by using an embedding dimension m and a time

delay τ

~x(t) = ~xi = (cid:16)ui, ui+τ , . . . , ui+(m−1) τ (cid:17) ,

t = i ∆t.

(1)

The choice of m and τ are based on standard methods for detecting these

parameters like method of false nearest neighbours (for m) and mutual infor-

mation (for τ ), which ensures the entire covering of all free parameters and

avoiding of autocorrelation eﬀects [2].

The recurrence plot is deﬁned as

Ri, j = Θ (εi − k~xi − ~xjk) ,

(2)

where εi is a predeﬁned cut-oﬀ distance, k · k is the norm (e. g. the Euclidean

norm) and Θ(x) is the Heaviside function. The values one and zero in this

matrix can be simply visualized by the colours black and white. Depending

on the kind of the application, εi can be a ﬁxed value or it can be changed

for each i in such a way that in the ball with the radius εi a predeﬁned

amount of neighbours occurs. The latter will provide a constant density of

recurrence points in each column of the RP. Such a RP exhibits characteristic

large-scale and small-scale patterns which are caused by typical dynamical

behavior [7,12,10], e. g. diagonals (similar local evolution of diﬀerent parts of

the trajectory) or horizontal and vertical black lines (state does not change

for some time). A single recurrence point, however, contains no information

about the state itself.

As a quantitative extension of the method of recurrence plots, the recurrence

quantiﬁcation analysis (RQA) was introduced by Zbilut and Webber [10,11].

This technique deﬁnes several measures mostly based on diagonal oriented

lines in the recurrence plot: recurrence rate, determinism, maximal length of

3

diagonal structures, entropy and trend. The recurrence rate is the ratio of all

recurrent states (recurrence points) to all possible states and is therefore the

probability of the recurrence of a certain state. Stochastic behaviour causes

very short diagonals, whereas deterministic behaviour causes longer diago-

nals. Therefore, the ratio of recurrence points forming diagonal structures to

all recurrence points is called the determinism (although this measure does

not really reﬂect the determinism of the system). Diagonal structures show

the range in which a piece of the trajectory is rather close to another one at

diﬀerent time. The diagonal length is the time span they will be close to each

other and their mean can be interpreted as the mean prediction time. The

inverse of the maximal line length can be interpreted to be directly related

with the maximal positive Lyapunov exponent [7,9,16]; in this interpretation

it is assumed that the considered system is chaotic and has no stochastic in-

ﬂuences. Since real (natural) systems are always aﬀected by noise, we suggest

that this measure has to be interpreted in a more statistical way, for instance

as a prediction time. However, if we consider a chaotic system, the maximal

positive Lyapunov exponent is much more reﬂected in the distribution of the

line lengths. The entropy is deﬁned as the Shannon entropy in the histogram

of diagonal line lengths. Stationary systems will deliver rather homogeneous

recurrence plots, whereas nonstationary systems cause changes in the distribu-

tion of recurrence points in the plot visible by brightened areas. For example,

a simple drift in the data causes a paling of the recurrence plot away from

the main diagonal to the edges. The parameter trend measures this eﬀect by

diagonal wise computation of the diagonal recurrence density and its linear

relation to the time distance of these diagonals to the main diagonal.

4

3 Cross Recurrence Plot

Analogous to Zbilut et al. [13], we have recently expanded the method of re-

currence plots to the method of cross recurrence plots, which compares the

dynamics represented in two time series. Herein, both time series are simul-

taneously embedded in the same phase space. The test for closeness of each

point of the ﬁrst trajectory ~xi (i = 1 . . . N) with each point of the second

trajectory ~yj (j = 1 . . . M) results in a N × M array CRi, j = Θ(ε − k~xi − ~yjk)

called the cross recurrence plot (CRP). Visual inspection of CRPs already re-

veals valuable information about the relationship between both systems. Long

diagonal structures show similar phase space behaviour of both time series. It

is obvious, that if the diﬀerence of both systems vanishes, the main diagonal

line will occur black. An additional time dilatation or compression of one of

these similar trajectories causes a distortion of this diagonal line [14]. In the

following, we suppose that both systems do not have diﬀerences in the time

scale and have the same length N, hence, the CRP is a N × N array and an

increasing similarity between both systems causes a raising of the recurrence

point density along the main diagonal until a black straight main diagonal

line occurs (cf. Fig. 3). Finally, the CRP compares the considered systems

and allows us to benchmark their similarity.

4 Complexity measures based on cross recurrence plots

Next, we will deﬁne some modiﬁed RQA measures for quantifying the sim-

ilarity between the phase space trajectories. Since we use the occurrence of

the more or less discontinuous main diagonal as a measure for similarity, the

modiﬁed RQA measures will be determined for each diagonal line parallel to

the main diagonal, hence, as functions of the distance from the main diagonal.

Therefore, it is also possible to assess the similarity in the dynamics depending

5

on a certain delay.

We analyze the distributions of the diagonal line lengths Pt(l) for each diagonal

parallel to the main diagonal. The index t ∈ [−T . . . T ] marks the number of

diagonal line, where t = 0 marks the main diagonal, t > 0 the diagonals above

and t < 0 the diagonals below the main diagonal, which represent positive

and negative time delays, respectively.

The recurrence rate RR is now deﬁned as

RR(t) =

l Pt(l)

the same phase space regions.

Analogous to the RQA the determinism

DET (t) = P

N −t

and reveals the probability of occurrence of similar states in both systems with

a given delay t. A high density of recurrence points in a diagonal results in a

high value of RR. This is the case for systems whose trajectories often visit

is the proportion of recurrence points forming long diagonal structures of all

recurrence points. Stochastic as well as heavily ﬂuctuating data cause none or

only short diagonals, whereas deterministic systems cause longer diagonals. If

both deterministic systems have the same or similar phase space behaviour,

i. e. parts of the phase space trajectories meet the same phase space regions

during certain times, the amount of longer diagonals increases and the amount

of smaller diagonals decreases.

reports the duration of such a similarity in the dynamics. A high coincidence

of both systems increases the length of these diagonals.

High values of RR represent high probabilities of the occurrence of the same

state in both systems, high values of DET and L represent a long time span

of the occurrence of a similar dynamics in both systems. Whereas DET and

L are sensitive to fastly and highly ﬂuctuating data, RR measures the proba-

bilities of the occurrence of the same states in spite of these high ﬂuctuations

(noisy data). It is important to emphasize that these parameters are statistical

measures and that their validity increases with the size of the CRP.

Compared to the other methods, this CRP technique has important advan-

tages. Since all parameters are computed for various time delays, lags can

be identiﬁed and causal links proposed. An additional analysis with oppo-

site signed second time series allows us to distinguish positive and negative
relations. To recognize the measures for both cases, we add the index “+′′
to the measures for the positive linkage and the index “−′′ for the negative

linkage, e. g. RR+ and RR−. A further substantial advantage of our method

is the capability to ﬁnd also nonlinear similarities in short and nonstation-

ary time series with high noise levels as they typically occur, e. g., in biology

or earth sciences. However, the shortness and nonstationarity of data limits

this method as well. One way to reduce problems that occur with nonstation-

ary data is the alternative choice of the neighbourhood as a ﬁxed amount of

neighbours in the ball with a varying radius ε. A further major aspect is the

reliability of the found results. Until a mature statistical test is developed, a

ﬁrst approach could be a surrogate test.

In the next section we apply these measures of complexity to prototypical

model systems and to real data.

5 Examples illustrating the CRP

5.1 Noisy periodic data

First, we consider a classical example to check whether our technique is there

compatible with linear statistical tools: two sine functions f (x) and g(x) with

the same period (2 π), whereby the second function g(x) is shifted by π/2 and

strongly corrupted by additive Gaussian white noise ξ ∈ [−1, 1]; the signal to

noise ratio is 0.5 (Fig. 1). Both time series have a length of 500 data points

with a sampling rate of 2π/100.

We apply our analysis with m = 3, τ = π/2 and ε = 1.5 (ﬁxed radius,

Euclidean distance). The CRP shows diagonal structures separated by gaps

(Figs. 2). These gaps are the result of the high ﬂuctuation of the noisy sine

function. Due to the periodicity of these functions, the diagonals have a con-

stant distance to each other equal to the value of the period λ = 2 π. The

interrupted diagonal structures consist of a number of short diagonals. How-

ever, these are long enough to achieve signiﬁcant maxima in the measures RR,

DET and L.

As expected, in this example the classical cross-correlation function shows a

signiﬁcant correlation after a lag of π/2 (Fig. 3A). The RR, DET and L func-

tions also show maxima for positive and negative relation between f (x) and

g(x). These maxima occur with the same lags π/2 like the linear correlation

test (Fig. 3B-D). Despite the high noise level, these measures ﬁnd the correla-

tion. Hence, the result of this CRP analysis agrees with the linear correlation

analysis.

Due to the noisy data, the trajectories strongly ﬂuctuate in the phase space.

Therefore, only short diagonal lines in the CRP occur and the means of the

measures DET and L have (relative) small values.

8

5.2 System with non-linear correlations

The next example is dedicated to a nonlinear interrelation between systems.

We consider linear correlated noise (autoregressive process), which is nonlin-

early coupled with the x-component of the Lorenz system x(t) (solved with

an ODE solver for the standard parameters σ = 10, r = 28, b = 8/3 and a

time resolution of ∆t = 0.0185, [17,18]). We use a second order autoregressive

process yn and force it with the squared x-component

yn = 1.095 yn−1 − 0.400 yn−2 + 0.700 ξn + 0.300 x2
n,

(6)

where ξ is white noise and xn (x(t) → xn, t = n∆t) is normalized to standard

deviation σ. The coupling is realized without any lag.

The CRP of the AR-process (Eq. 6) with the Lorenz model measured in the

x-component (m = 10, τ = 5, ε = 4) contains a lot of longer diagonal lines,

which represent time ranges in which both systems have a similar phase space

dynamics (Fig. 5). The results of the quantitative analysis of the CRP is

strongly diﬀerent from those of the linear analysis. It is important to note

that the linear correlation analysis is here not able to detect any signiﬁcant

coupling or correlation between both systems (Fig. 6A). In contrast, all the

measures RR, DET and L have signiﬁcant maxima at a lag of about zero for

both embeddings with positive and negative sign (Figs. 6B-D). This means,

that these measures ﬁnd the nonlinear relation between the considered data

series, where the linear analysis is not able to detect this relation. Since the

result is independent of the sign of the second data before the embedding, the

found relation is of the kind of an even function.

The diﬀerences between the minima and maxima of RR and DET are smaller

than in the ﬁrst example, because in the second example we consider more

complex, nonlinear coupled systems. Since the signal to noise ratio in the sec-

9

ond example is smaller than in the ﬁrst one, their trajectories do not ﬂuctuate

so abruptly like in the ﬁrst example. This causes rather long diagonal lines

and the high values of DET and L.

5.3 Climatological data

The last example shows the potential of the CRPs in order to ﬁnd interrela-

tions in natural data. We investigate, whether there is a relation between the

precipitation in an Argentinian city and the El Ni˜no/ Southern Oscillation

(ENSO). Power spectra analysis of local rainfall data found periodicities of

2.3 and 3.6 years within the ENSO frequency band [19].

For our analysis we use monthly precipitation data from the city San Salvador

de Jujuy in NW Argentina for the time span 1908–1987 (data from [20]).

The behaviour of the ENSO phenomenon is well represented by the Southern

Oscillation Index (SOI), which is a normalized air pressure diﬀerence between

Tahiti and Darwin [21] (Fig. 7). Negative extrema in SOI data mark El Ni˜no

events and positive extrema La Ni˜na events. We use the monthly SOI data for

the same time span as the rainfall data. Both data sets have lengths of 960

points.

The cross correlation function shows a rather small correlation ̺ = 0.14 be-

tween both data series (Fig. 9A).

After normalization the data, the CRP with m = 3, τ = 4 and ε = 1.3 is

calculated and shows several structures (Fig. 8).

The CRP analysis of local rainfall and SOI is done with a predeﬁned short-

est diagonal length lmin = 6. The analysis reveals maxima for the complexity

measures RR+, DET+ and L+ for correlated behaviour around a delay of zero

months, whereas the measures for anti-correlated behaviour RR−, DET− and

10

L− increase after about ﬁve months (Fig. 9). This result enables to conclude

a positive relation between ENSO and the local rainfall. This gives some in-

dication that the occurrence of an El Ni˜no (extreme negative SOI) at the end

of a year causes a decreased rainfall in the rainy season from November to

January and the occurrence of a La Ni˜na (extreme positive SOI) causes an

increased rainfall during this time of the year. This conclusion extends the

results obtained by power spectra analysis, where the similar periodicities in

both SOI and local rainfall data were found [19]. Both analysis show that a

source for inter-annual precipitation variability in NW Argentina is the ENSO

[19].

The linear correlation analysis ﬁnds the correlation, however, it is scarce above

the signiﬁcance and its mean at a lag of three months. In contrast, all the com-

plexity measures RR, DET and L show a signiﬁcant result and decomposite

the correlation in a positive one with no delay and in a negative one with a de-

lay of about ﬁve months, what suggests a more complex interrelation between

the ENSO phenomenon and local rainfall in NW Argentina.

6 Conclusions

We have expanded the method of recurrence plots (RPs) to cross recurrence

plots (CRPs) in order to study two diﬀerent phase space trajectories. Local

similar time evolution of the states becomes then visible by long diagonal lines.

The distributions of recurrence points and diagonal lines along the main diag-

onal provides an evaluation of the similarity of the phase space trajectories of

both systems. We have introduced three new measures of complexity based on

these distributions. They enable to quantify a possible similarity and interre-

lation between both dynamical systems. We have demonstrated the potentials

of this approach for typical model systems and natural data. In the case of

linear systems, the results with this nonlinear technique agree with the linear

11

correlation test. However, in the case of nonlinear coupled systems, the linear

correlation test does not found any correlation, whereas the new complexity

measures clearly reveal this relation. Additionally, they determine the kind

of coupling as to be an even function. The application to climatological data

enables to ﬁnd a more complex relationship between the El Ni˜no and local

rainfall in NW Argentina than the linear correlation test or the power spectra

analysis yielded.

Our quantiﬁcation analysis of CRPs is able to ﬁnd nonlinear relations between

dynamical systems. It provides more information than a linear correlation

analysis. The future work is dedicated to the development of a signiﬁcance

test for RPs and the complexity measures which are based on RPs.

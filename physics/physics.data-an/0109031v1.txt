Abstract

Fractal behavior and long-range dependence have been observed in an astonishing number
of physical systems. Either phenomenon has been modeled by self-similar random functions,
thereby implying a linear relationship between fractal dimension, a measure of roughness, and
Hurst coeﬃcient, a measure of long-memory dependence. This letter introduces simple stochas-
tic models which allow for any combination of fractal dimension and Hurst exponent. We syn-
thesize images from these models, with arbitrary fractal properties and power-law correlations,
and propose a test for self-similarity.

I. Introduction. Following Mandelbrot’s seminal essay [1], fractal-based analyses of time series,
proﬁles, and natural or man-made surfaces have found extensive applications in almost all scientiﬁc
disciplines [2–5]. The fractal dimension, D, of a proﬁle or surface is a measure of roughness, with D ∈
[n, n + 1) for a surface in n-dimensional space and higher values indicating rougher surfaces. Long-
memory dependence or persistence in time series [6–8] or spatial data [9–11] is associated with power-
law correlations and often referred to as Hurst eﬀect. Scientists in diverse ﬁelds observed empirically
that correlations between observations that are far apart in time or space decay much slower than
would be expected from classical stochastic models. Long-memory dependence is characterized by
the Hurst coeﬃcient, H. In principle, fractal dimension and Hurst coeﬃcient are independent of each
other: fractal dimension is a local property, and long-memory dependence is a global characteristic.
Nevertheless, the two notions are closely linked in much of the scientiﬁc literature. This stems from
the success of self-similar models such as fractional Gaussian noise and fractional Brownian motion
[12] in modeling and explaining either phenomenon. For self-similar processes, the local properties
are reﬂected in the global ones, resulting in the celebrated relationship

D = n + 1 − H

(1)

between fractal dimension, D, and Hurst coeﬃcient, H, for a self-similar surface in n-dimensional
space [1,3]. Long-memory dependence, or persistence, is associated with the case H ∈ ( 1
2 , 1) and
therefore linked to surfaces with low fractal dimensions. Rougher surfaces with higher fractal di-
mensions occur for antipersistent processes with H ∈ (0, 1
2 ). Self-similarity is undoubtedly a natural
assumption for many physical, geological, and biological systems. Owing to its intuitive appeal
and a lack of suitable alternatives, self-similarity and the linear relationship (1) are believed to be
warranted by a large number of real-world data sets.

The stochastic models presented here provide a fresh perspective, since they allow for any com-
bination of fractal dimension, D, and Hurst exponent, H. The models are very simple, have only
two exponents, and allow for the straightforward synthesis of images with arbitrary fractal proper-
ties and power-law correlations. We call for a critical assessment of self-similar models and of the
relationship (1) through joint measurements of D and H in physical systems.

II. Stationary processes. This section recalls some basic facts for reference below. In the interest
of a clear presentation, we restrict ourselves to a discussion of stationary, standard Gaussian [13]

1

random functions Z(x), x ∈ Rn, which are characterized by their correlation function,

c(h) = < Z(x)Z(x + h) >,

h ∈ Rn.

The behavior of the correlation function at h = 0 determines the local properties of the realizations.
Speciﬁcally, if

1 − c(h) ∼ |h|α

as h → 0

for some α ∈ (0, 2], then the realizations of the random function have fractal dimension

with probability one [14]. Similarly, the asymptotic behavior of the correlation function at inﬁnity
determines the presence or absence of long-range dependence. Long-memory processes are associated
with power-law correlations,

c(h) ∼ |h|

−β

as

|h| → ∞,

and if β ∈ (0, 2), the behavior is frequently expressed in terms of the Hurst coeﬃcient,

D = n + 1 −

α
2

H = 1 −

β
2

.

The asymptotic relationships (3) and (5) can be expressed equivalently in terms of the spectral
density and its behavior at inﬁnity and zero, respectively. The traditional stationary, self-similar
stochastic process is fractional Gaussian noise [12], that is, the Gaussian process with correlation
function

c(h) =

|h + 1|2H − 2|h|2H + |h − 1|2H

h ∈ R,

,

(cid:1)

1
2 (cid:0)

where H ∈ (0, 1) is the Hurst coeﬃcient. Then 1 − c(h) ∼ |h|2H as h → 0 and

c(h)

H(2H − 1)|h|−(2−2H) → 1 as

|h| → ∞;

hence, the linear relationship (1) holds with n = 1. The case H ∈ ( 1
2 , 1) is associated with positive
correlations, persistent processes, and low fractal dimensions; if H ∈ (0, 1
2 ) we ﬁnd negative cor-
relations, antipersistent processes, and high fractal dimensions. In other words, the assumption of
statistical self-similarity determines the relationships between local and global behavior, or fractal
dimension and Hurst eﬀect. By way of contrast, the stochastic models presented hereinafter allow
for any combination of fractal dimension and Hurst coeﬃcient.

III. Cauchy class. The Cauchy class consists of the stationary Gaussian random processes Z(x),

x ∈ Rn, with correlation function

c(h) = (1 + |h|α)

−β/α ,

h ∈ Rn,

for any combination of the parameters α ∈ (0, 2] and β ≥ 0. It provides ﬂexible power-law cor-
relations and generalizes stochastic models recently discussed and synthesized in geostatistics [15],
physics [11,16], hydrology [17], and time series analysis [18–19]. These works consider time series (in
discrete time) only, or they restrict α to 1 or 2. The special case α = 2 has been known as Cauchy
model [15], and we refer to the general case, α ∈ (0, 2], as Cauchy class. The correlation function (9)
behaves like (3) and (5) as h → 0 and |h| → ∞, respectively. Thus, the realizations of the associated

random process have fractal dimension D, as given by (4); and if β ∈ (0, 2) the Hurst coeﬃcient, H,
is given by (6). In particular, D and H may vary independently. Figure 1 illustrates two-dimensional
realizations of the Cauchy class for various values of α and β. In each row, β = 2 − 2H is constant;
but from left to right α increases, that is, the fractal dimension, D = 3 − α
2 , decreases. In each
column, the fractal dimension is constant, but from top to bottom the Hurst coeﬃcient decreases.
These values of D and H are the theoretical quantities as determined by the correlation function.
The measured values for the realizations diﬀer from the theoretical ones, due to chance variability
and the discrete nature of simulations, but only slightly so. We used the turning bands method with
line simulations by the circulant embedding approach [20] to generate the realizations. The code is
publicly available [21] and allows, for the ﬁrst time, for the straightforward synthesis of images with
any given combination of fractal dimension and Hurst coeﬃcient.

IV. Modiﬁed Cauchy class. The Cauchy class allows for any positive parameter β in the power-
law (5), and the correlations are always positive. In contrast, fractional Gaussian noise can only
model power-laws with β ∈ (0, 2), and the correlations eventually become negative if H ∈ (0, 1
2 ) or
β ∈ (1, 2). We consider the positive correlations to be an advantage of the Cauchy model, since
positive power-laws are ubiquitous in the physical, geological, and biological sciences. Nevertheless,
we present another stochastic model, the modiﬁed Cauchy class, which allows for any combination of
fractal dimension and Hurst coeﬃcient and also features the transition from persistence to antiper-
sistence. The modiﬁed Cauchy class consists of the stationary Gaussian random processes Z(x),
x ∈ R, with correlation function

c(h) = (1 + |h|α)

−(β/α)−1 (1 + (1 − β)|h|α) ,

h ∈ R,

(10)

where α ∈ (0, 2] and β ≥ 0 [22].
In the same way as (9), the correlation function (10) behaves
like (3) and (5) as h → 0 and |h| → ∞, respectively, yielding the same conclusions for the fractal
dimension, D, given by (4), and Hurst coeﬃcient, H, given by (6). Furthermore, there is a transition
from positive to negative correlations, or persistence to antipersistence, respectively, depending on
whether β is smaller or greater than 1. Similarly to fractional Gaussian noise, (10) is a valid
correlation function in R, but not in the general Euclidean space Rn (n > 1). Figure 2 illustrates
realizations of the modiﬁed Cauchy class. The graphs along the subdiagonal correspond to parameter
combinations with α + β = 2, or D = 2 − H, the same relationship as for self-similar processes.
The graphs along the diagonal, however, correspond to parameter combinations of D and H which
cannot be realized for self-similar processes.

V. Discussion. We introduced simple stochastic models which separate fractal dimension and
Hurst coeﬃcient, and allow for any combination of the two parameters. This is in sharp contrast to
traditional, self-similar models for which fractal dimension and Hurst coeﬃcient are linearly related.
To our knowledge, Figures 1 provides the ﬁrst display of fractal images, in which fractal dimension
and Hurst coeﬃcient vary independently. Publicly available code [21] allows to synthesize images
with any pre-speciﬁed combination of fractal dimension and Hurst coeﬃcient. We draw two major
conclusions. The ﬁrst concerns estimation and measurement. Various methods have been proposed
and applied to estimate fractal dimension and Hurst coeﬃcient. Popular techniques for estimating or
measuring fractal dimension include box-counting, spectral, and increment-based methods [1,3,23–
25], and estimators for the Hurst coeﬃcient range from Mandelbrot’s R/S analysis to maximum
likelihood [1,7,26]. For estimation of D, it is tempting to estimate the Hurst exponent H, and then
apply the linear relationship (1), or vice versa [27]. We disapprove of any such approach, since
the estimator breaks down easily if the critical assumption of self-similarity is violated. Secondly,
our ﬁndings suggest a straightforward test of self-similarity for time series, proﬁles, or surfaces [28]:

3

estimate D, a local roughness parameter, and H, a long-memory parameter, and check whether the
estimates are statistically compatible with the linear relationship (1). A positive answer for a large
number of data sets, across disciplines, will further substantiate the role of self-similarity within the
sciences. Conversely, a negative answer may reject a self-similar model, but it does not preclude
fractal statistics or long-memory dependence. The Cauchy and modiﬁed Cauchy model provide a
striking illustration - and this might be our key point - that the two notions are independent of each
other, and can be modeled, explained, and synthesized without recourse to self-similarity.

Figure 1. Realizations of the Cauchy class with α = 0.5, 1, 2 (from left to right) and β =
0.025, 0.2, 0.9 (from top to bottom). In each row, the Hurst coeﬃcient, H = 1 − β
2 , is constant,
but the fractal dimension, D = 3 − α
2 , decreases from left to right (D = 2.75, 2.5, 2). Accordingly,
the images become smoother. In each column, the fractal dimension is held constant, but the Hurst
parameter decreases from top to bottom (H = 0.9875, 0.9, 0.55). Accordingly, persistence and long-
range dependence become less pronounced. The pseudo-random seed is the same for all nine images,
and the length of an edge corresponds to a lag of 16 units in the correlation function (9).

Figure 2. Realizations of the modiﬁed Cauchy class with α = 0.65 (left) and 1.95 (right), and
β = 0.05 (top, persistent) and 1.35 (bottom, antipersistent). Again, the distinct eﬀects of fractal
dimension and Hurst coeﬃcient are evident. The pseudo-random seed is the same for all four proﬁles,
and the maximal lag corresponds to 32 units in the correlation function (10).

We present results about ﬁnancial market observables, speciﬁcally returns and traded volumes.
They are obtained within the current nonextensive statistical mechanical framework based on the

tic dynamical mechanisms which mimic probability density functions empirically observed. These
mechanisms provide possible interpretations for the emergence of the entropic indices q in the time
evolution of the corresponding observables. In addition to this, through multi-fractal analysis of
return time series, we verify that the dual relation qstat + qsens = 2 is numerically satisﬁed, qstat
and qsens being associated to the probability density function and to the sensitivity to initial con-
ditions respectively. This type of simple relation, whose understanding remains ellusive, has been
empirically veriﬁed in various other systems.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years statistical mechanics has enlarged its
original assignment: the application of statistics to large
systems whose states are governed by some Hamilto-
nian functional [1]. Its capability for relating microscopic
states of individual constituents of a system to its macro-
scopic properties are nowadays used ubiquitously [2].
Certainly, the most important of these connections still is
the determination of thermodynamic properties through
the correspondence between the entropy concept, origi-
nally introduced by Rudolf Julius Emmanuel Clausius in
1865 [3], and the number of allowed microscopic states,
introduced by Ludwig Boltzmann around 1877 when he
was studying the approach to equilibrium of an ideal
gas [4]. This connection can be expressed as

S = k ln W,

(1)

where k is a positive constant, and W is the number
of microstates compatible with the macroscopic state of
an isolated system. This equation, known as Boltzmann
principle, is one of the cornerstones of standard statistical
mechanics.

When the system is not isolated, but instead in con-
tact to some large reservoir, it is possible to extend Eq.
(1), under some assumptions, and obtain the Boltzmann-
Gibbs entropy

SBG = −k

pi ln pi ,

where pi is the probability of the microscopic conﬁgura-
tion i [1]. The Boltzmann principle should be derivable
from microscopic dynamics, since it refers to microscopic
states, but the implementation of such calculation has
not been yet achieved. So, Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) sta-
tistical mechanics is still based on hypothesis such as the
molecular chaos [4] and ergodicity [5]. In spite of the lack
of an actual fundamental derivation, BG statistics has
been undoubtedly successful in the treatment of systems
in which short spatio/temporal interactions dominate.
For such cases, ergodicity and (quasi-) independence are
favoured and Khinchin’s approach to SBG is valid [5].
Therefore, it is entirely feasible that other physical en-
tropies, in addition to the BG one, can be deﬁned in
order to properly treat anomalous systems, for which the
simplifying hypothesis of ergodicity and/or independence
are not fulﬁlled. Examples are: metastable states in
long-range interacting Hamiltonian dynamics, metaequi-
librium states in small systems (i.e., systems whose num-
ber of particles is much smaller than Avogrado’s num-
ber), glassy systems, some types of dissipative dynamics,
and other systems that in some way violate ergodicity.
This includes systems with non-Markovian memory (i.e.,
long-range memory), like it seems to be the case of ﬁnan-
cial ones. Generically speaking, systems that may have
a multi-fractal, scale-free or hierarchical structure in the
occupancy of their phase space.

Inspired by this kind of systems it was proposed in

1988 the entropy [6]

is to be determined a priori from microscopic dynamics.
Just like SBG, Sq is nonnegative, concave, experimentally
robust (or Lesche-stable [10]) (∀q > 0), and leads to a
ﬁnite entropy production per unit time [2, 11]. Moreover,
it has been recently shown [12] that it is also extensive,
i.e.,

for special kinds of correlated systems, more precisely
when the phase-space is occupied in a scale-invariant
form. By being extensive, for an appropriate value of
q, Sq complies with Clausius’ concept on macroscopic
entropy, and with thermodynamics.

Since its proposal, entropy (3) has been the source of
several results in both fundamental and applied physics,
as well as in other scientiﬁc areas such as biology, chem-
istry, economics, geophysics and medicine [13]. Herein,
we both review and present some new results concern-
ing applications to the dynamics of ﬁnancial market ob-
servables, namely the price ﬂuctuations and traded vol-
umes. Speciﬁcally, we will introduce stochastic dynam-
ical mechanisms which are able to reproduce some fea-
tures of quantities such as the probability density func-
tions (PDFs) and the Kramer-Moyal moments. More-
over, we will present some results concerning the return
multi-fractal structure, and its relation to sensitivity to
initial conditions.

Our dynamical proposals will be faced to empirical
analysis of 1 minute returns and traded volumes of the
30 companies that were used to compose the Dow Jones
Industrial Average (DJ30) between the 1st July and the
31st December 2004. In order to eliminate specious be-
haviours we have removed the well-known intra-day pat-
tern following a standard procedure [8]. After that, the
return values were subtracted from its average value and
expressed in standard deviation units, whereas the traded
volumes are expressed in mean traded volume units.

II. VARIATIONAL PRINCIPLE USING THE
ENTROPY Sq

Before dealing with speciﬁc ﬁnancial problems, let us
analyse the probability density function which emerges
when the variational principle is applied to Sq [9].

Let us consider its continuous version, i.e.,

Sq = k

for q > 1, PDF (14) presents an asymptotic power-
law behaviour. On the other hand, if q = n−4
n−2 with
n = 3, 4, 5, . . ., p (x) recovers the r-distribution with n

a compact support which is deﬁned by the condition

III. APPLICATION TO MACROSCOPIC
OBSERVABLES

A. Model for price changes

The Gaussian distribution, recovered in the limit q → 1
of expression (14), can be derived from various stand-
points. Besides the variational principle, it has been de-
rived, through dynamical arguments, by L. Bachelier in

his 1900 work on price changes in Paris stock market [14],
and also by A. Einstein in his 1905 article on Brownian
motion [15]. In particular, starting from a Langevin dy-
namics, we are able to write the corresponding Fokker-
Planck equation and, from it, to obtain as solution the
Gaussian distribution. Analogously, it is also possible,
from certain classes of stochastic diﬀerential equations
and their associated Fokker-Planck equations, to obtain
the distribution given by Eq. (14).

In this section, we will discuss a dynamical mechanism
for returns, r, which is based on a Langevin-like equation
that leads to a PDF (q-Gaussian) with asymptotic power-
law behaviour [16, 17]. This equation is expressed as

dr = −k r dt +

θ [p (r, t)](1−q) dWt

(q ≥ 1) , (15)

q

(in Itˆo convention) where Wt is a regular Wiener process
and p(r, t) is the intantaneous return PDF. In a return
context the deterministic term of eq. (15) intends to rep-
resent internal mechanisms which tend to keep the mar-
ket in some average return or, in a analogous interpreta-
tion, can be related to the eternal competition between
speculative price and the actual worth of a company. In
our case, we use the simplest approach and write it as
a restoring force, with a constant k, similar to the vis-
cous force in the regular Langevin equation. In regard to
the stochastic term, it aims to reproduce the microscopic
response of the system to the return: θ is the volatility
constant (intimately associated to the variance of p(r, t))
and q, the nonextensive index, reﬂects the magnitude of
that response. Since the largest unstabilities in the mar-
ket are introduced by the most unexpected return values,
it is plausible that the stochastic term in Eq. (15) can
have such inverse dependence on the PDF p(r, t). Fur-
thermore, Eq. (15) presents a dynamical multiplicative
noise structure given by,

r (t) =

′)
e−k(t−t

θ [p (r, t)](1−q) dWt′ ,

(16)

where we have assumed r (−∞) = 0.

(18)

One of the most interesting features of eq. (15) is its
aptitude to reproduce the celebrated U-shape of the 2nd
(i.e., n = 2) Kramers-Moyal moment

3

It is this fact which allowed the establishment of analogies
(currently used in ﬁnancial mimicry) between ﬁnancial
markets dynamics and ﬂuid turbulence [20].

It is noteworthy that eq. (16) is statistically equivalent

to [18, 21]

dr = −k r dt + Aq (t) dWt + (q − 1) Bq (r, t) dW ′

t , (20)

i.e., a stochastic diﬀerential equation with independent
additive and multiplicative noises. If eq. (15) allows an
immediate heuristic relation between q and the response
(20) permits
of the system to its own dynamics, eq.
a straighforward dynamical relation between q and the
magnitude of multiplicative noise in such a way that, for
q = 1, the Langevin equation is recovered as well as the
Gaussian distribution.

In Fig. (1) we present the typical PDF for the 1 minute
returns of a company constituent of the Dow Jones Indus-
trial Average 30 (upper panel) presenting q = 1.31±0.02,
a time series generated by eq. (15) (middle panel), and
the U-shaped 2nd Kramers-Moyal moment for our data
(lower panel). As it can be seen the accordance using the
simplest approach is already quite nice. Upgrades of this
model can be obtained by taking into account the risk-
aversion eﬀects, which induce asymmetry on the PDF,
and correlations on the volatility in a way which diﬀers
from others previously proposed. The formulation pre-
sented herein has also the advantage of being aplicable
to systems which are not in a stationary state since the
time-dependent solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation
are of the q-Gaussian type as well.

B. Model for traded volumes

Changes in the price of a certain equity are naturally
dependent on transactions of that equity and thus on its
traded volume, v. Previous studies proved the asymp-
totic power-law behaviour of traded volume PDF [22],
later extended for all values of v [23]. In this case it was
shown that the traded volume PDF is very well described
by the following ansatz distribution

Consider now, that instead of being a constant, ω is a
time dependent quantity which evolves on a time scale
T larger than the time scale of order γ−1 required by
eq. (22) to reach stationarity [25, 26]. This time depen-
dence is, in the present model, associated to changes in
the volume of activity (number of traders that performed
transactions) and empirically justiﬁed through the anal-
ysis of the self-correlation function for returns. In Fig. 2
we have veriﬁed that the correlation function is very well
described by

C [v (t) , v (t + τ )] = C1 e−τ /T1 + C2 e−τ /T2

(24)

with T2 = 332 ≫ T1 = 13.
In other words, there is
ﬁrst a fast decay of C [v (t) , v (t + τ )], related to local
equilibrium, and then a much slower decay for larger τ .
This constitutes a necessary condition for the application
of a superstatistical model [25].

If we assume that ω follows a Gamma PDF, i.e.,

tem in order to keep v close to some “normal” value,

of v, like a multiplicative noise commonly used in inter-
mittent processes. This dynamics, and the correspond-
ing Fokker-Planck equation [18], lead to the following

5

Analogously, it was recently conjectured [28] that, for
systems which can be studied within nonextensive statis-
tical mechanics, the energy probability density function
(associated to stationarity or (meta) equilibrium), the
sensitivity to the initial conditions, and the relaxation
would be described by three entropic indices qstat, qsens,
and qrel, referred to as the q-triplet. The ﬁrst physi-
cal corroboration of such scenario has been made from
the analysis of two sets of daily averages of the mag-
netic ﬁeld strength observed by Voyager 1 in the solar
wind [29]. Others systems are currently on study (e.g.,
[30]). Of course, if the system is non Hamiltonian, it has
no energy distribution, hence qstat cannot deﬁned in this
manner. We may however estimate it through a station-
ary state generalised Gaussian (which would generalise
the Maxwellian distribution of velocities for a BG sys-
tem in thermal equilibrium). In contrast, the other two
indices, qsens and qrel, remain deﬁned in the usual way.
Let us focus now on the multi-fractal structure of re-
turn time series. It has been ﬁrst conjectured, and later
proved, for a variety of nonextensive one-dimensional sys-
tems, that the following relation holds [31]:

trum of 1 minute traded volumes, obtained by the appli-
cation of the MF-DFA5 method [32]; h and f (h) have
been obtained from averages of the empirical data of 30
companies. Through this analysis, we have determined
hmin = 0.28 ± 0.04 and hmax = 0.83 ± 0.04. The use
of Eq. (28) yields qsens = 0.58 ± 0.10. Considering that
the q value obtained for the return probability density
function was qstat = 1.31 ± 0.02, we verify that the dual
relation

qstat + qsens = 2

(29)

is approximately satisﬁed within the error intervals. Tak-
ing into account the well-known fast decay of return self-
correlations, we see that the price changes for a typical
DJ30 stock may be essentially described by the q-triplet
{qsen, qstat, qrel} = {0.58 ± 0.10, 1.31 ± 0.02, 1}.

V. FINAL REMARKS

In this article we have presented a nonextensive sta-
tistical mechanics approach to the dynamics of ﬁnan-
cial markets observables, speciﬁcally the return and the
traded volume. With this approach we have been able
to present mesoscopic dynamical interpretations for the
emergence of the entropic index q frequently obtained by
a numerical adjustment for data PDF of eqs. (18) and
(21). For the case of returns, q is related to the reaction
degree of the agents on the market to ﬂuctuations of the

we can redeﬁne our parameters and obtain the q-Gamma
PDF (21).

In Fig. 3 we present a comparation between the traded
volume of Citigroup (2004 world’s number one company
[27]) stocks, as well as a replica of that time series ob-
tained using this dynamical proposal. As it can be easily
veriﬁed, the agreement is remarkable.

IV. THE NONEXTENSIVE q-TRIPLET AND
FINANCIAL OBSERVABLES

Systems characterised by Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical
mechanics present the following characteristics: (i) Their
PDF for energies is proportional to an exponential func-
tion in the presence of a thermostat; (ii) They have strong
sensitivity to the initial conditions, i.e., this quantity in-
creases exponentially with time (currently referred to as
strong chaos), being characterised by a positive maxi-
mum Lyapunov exponent; (iii) They typically present,
for basic macroscopic quantities, an exponential decay
with some relaxation time. In other words, these three
behaviours exhibit exponential functions (i.e., q = 1).

6

the stationary state, the sensitivity to initial conditions,
and the relaxation for nonextensive systems. The com-
plete understanding of these connections remains ellu-
sive. For instance, concerning relaxation and the q-triplet
conjecture, a new question arise for price changes. It is
well-known that the self-correlation for returns is of ex-
ponential kind, in contrast with the long-lasting correla-
tions for the volatility (or returns magnitude) [33]. The
latter is also considered a stylised fact and it is compati-
ble with a q-exponential form. In this way, if the eﬃcient
market hypothesis is considered the key element in ﬁnan-
cial markets, then it makes sense to assume qrel = 1. But,
if arbitrage on markets is considered as the fundamental
feature instead, then the essential relaxation to be taken
into account might be the one related to the volatility, for
which qrel > 1. Progress is clearly still needed, at both
the fundamental and applied levels, in order to achieve a
deep understanding of this complex system.

observable, while for the case of traded volume it is asso-
ciated to ﬂuctuations on the (local) average traded vol-
ume. Along with these dynamical scenarios, and based
on the multi-fractal nature of returns, we have veriﬁed
that this quantity appears to approximatively satisfy the
dual relation, qstat + qsens = 2, previously conjectured
within the emergence of the q-triplet which characterises

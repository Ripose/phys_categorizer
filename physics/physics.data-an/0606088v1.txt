Using Memory Tabu Search(MTS) algorithm, we investigate the relationship between structural
characters and synchronizability of scale-free networks by maximizing and minimizing the ratio Q
of the eigenvalues of the coupling matrix by edge-intercrossing procedures. The numerical results
indicate that clustering coeﬃcient C, maximal betweenness Bmax are two most important factors
to scale-free network synchronizability, and assortative coeﬃcient r and average distance D are the
secondary ones. Moreover, the average degree hki aﬀects the relationship between above structural
characters and synchronizability of scale-free networks, and the minimal Q decreases when hki
increases.

Based on nonlinear dynamics, synchronization in cou-
pled dynamical systems has been studied for many years.
It is observed in a variety of natural, social, physical, and
biological systems and has found applications in a vari-
ety of ﬁelds [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. In particular, synchro-
nization in networks of coupled chaotic systems has re-
ceived a great deal of attention over the past two decades
[8, 9, 10, 11]. However, most of these works have been
concentrated on networks with regular topological struc-
tures such as chains, grids, lattices, and fully connected
graphs[12, 13, 14, 15]. Recent empirical studies have
demonstrated that many real-world networks have two
common statistical characteristics: small-world eﬀect[16]
and scale-free property[17], which cannot be treated as
regular or random networks. Recently, an increasing
number of studies have been devoted to investigating syn-
chronization phenomena in complex networks with small-
world and scale-free topologies [18, 19, 20, 21].

One of the goals in studying network synchronization
is to understand how the network topology aﬀects the
synchronizability. The network synchronizability can be
measured well by the eigenratio Q of the largest eigen-
value and the smallest nonzero eigenvalue [22, 23, 24, 25];
thus, our work is to understand the relationship between
network structure and its eigenvalues. Since there are
several topological characters of scale-free networks, what
is the most important factor by which the synchronizabil-
ity of the system is mainly determined?

In this brief report, we studied the relationship be-
tween structural characters and synchronizability of
scale-free networks. Some detailed comparisons among
various networks have been done, indicating the network
synchronizability will be stronger with smaller hetero-
geneity, which can be measured by the variance of degree
distribution or betweenness distribution [25, 26, 27], but
the strict and clear conclusions have not been achieved
because that previous studies are of both varying aver-

age distances and degree variances. Another extensively
studied one is average distance D. Some works indi-
cated the average distance D is one of the key factors
to network synchronizability [28]. However, we have not
achieved the consistent conclusion [19, 21, 25]. Some
researchers considered that the randomicity is the more
intrinsic factors leading to better synchronizability [29],
which means that the intrinsic reason making small-world
and scale-free networks having better synchronizability
than regular ones is their random structures. Recently,
several researches examine the eﬀect of clustering coeﬃ-
cient on the synchronization by using Kuramoto model
[30] or master stability function [31, 32]. Other re-
searchers focus on the role played by maximal between-
ness Bmax, they found the network synchronizability will
be better with smaller Bmax [26, 33]. Zhao et. al [27] en-
hanced the synchronizability by structural perturbations,
they found that maximal betweenness plays a main role
in network synchronization [34]. Zhou et. al [28] studied
the average distance D to synchronizability by crossed
double cycle. However, a network contain several sta-
tistical characteristics, such as degree distribution P (k),
average distance D, clustering coeﬃcient C, maximal be-
tweenness Bmax and so on. In the previous works, if one
wants to show clearly how a structural character aﬀects
the network synchronizability, such as average distance
D, he would investigate the network synchronizability
with diﬀerent D while keeping other structural charac-
ters constant approximately. However, this method ne-
glect the inﬂuence made by the initial network struc-
tural characters.
In fact, the network functions, such
as the synchronizability, are aﬀected by these character-
istics simultaneously. Therefore, we should investigate
these structural factors holistically. In order to ﬁnd the
real factors aﬀect network synchronization and eliminate
the inﬂuence made by the initial networks, we maximize
and minimize the eigenratio Q by MTS algorithm [35]
from the same initial network. The structural characters
which change dramatically from maximal Q to minimal
Q are the key factors inﬂuence network synchronizability,
while the ones change little is not.

We investigate the synchronizability of a class of
continuous-time dynamical networks with scale-free
topology. Based on the synchronization criterion, we
maximize and minimize the ratio Q of the eigenvalues
of the coupling matrix by edge-intercrossing procedures,
which provides a way for observing the correlation be-
tween the synchronizability and those characteristics by
keeping the degree distribution unchanged.

We start by considering a network of N linearly cou-
pled identical oscillators. The equation of motion reads

˙xi = F(xi) + σ

Gij H(xj),

i = 1, · · · , N,

(1)

N

X
j=1

where ˙x = F(x) govern the local dynamics of the vector
ﬁeld xi in each node, H(x) is a linear vectorial function,
σ is the coupling strength, and G is a coupling matrix.

Stability of the synchronous state xi(t) = xs(t), i =
1, · · · , N can be accounted for by diagonalizing the lin-
ear stability equation, yielding N blocks of the form
˙ζi = JF(xs)ζi − σλiH(ζi), where J is the Jacobian op-
erator. Replacing σλi by ν in the equation, the master
stability function(MSF) [22] fully accounts for linear sta-
bility of the synchronization manifold. For a large class
of oscillatory systems, the MSF is negative in a ﬁnite
parameter interval Ist ≡ (ν1 ≤ ν ≤ ν2)[22]. When the
whole set of eigenvalues (multiplied by σ) enters the inter-
val Ist, the stability condition is satisﬁed. This is accom-
plished when σλ2 > ν2 and σλN < ν2 simultaneously.
As ν2 and ν1 depend on the speciﬁc choice of F(x) and
H(x), the key quantity for assessing the synchronization
of a network is the eigenratio

Q = λN /λ2,

(2)

which only depends on the topology of the network. The
small λN /λ2 is, the more packed the eigenvalues of G
are, leading to an enhanced σ interval for which stabil-
ity is obtained[36]. In this paper, we will not address a
particular dynamical system, but concentrate on how the
network topology aﬀects eigenratio Q.

The processes of heuristic algorithm, named MTS, is

as follows.

Step 1. Generate an initial matrix G0 of the extensional
BA network [37, 38] with N nodes and E edges. Set
the optimal network’ coupling matrix G∗
k = G0 and
the optimal network of taibu table Gk = G0, and
the time step k = 0. Compute the ratio Q of G∗
k.

Step 2. If a prescribed termination condition is satisﬁed,
stop; Otherwise intercrossing a pairs of edges cho-
sen randomly based on the network remains con-
nected, denote by G.

tabu condition, |QGk − QG|/RG > δ (where δ is a
random number between 0.5 and 0.75), Gk+1 = Gk,
else Gk+1 = G. Go to Step 2.

Since the MTS algorithm is heuristic, it can only ﬁnd
the approximate optimal solution. Thus, the termination
condition of Step 2 should conﬁrm by the experimenta-
tion solution.

The numerical results are experimented on extensional
BA model for diﬀerent network scales. The statistical
properties of the optimal networks show similar trends.
After many numerical experimentations, we set the ter-
mination condition for maximizing Q as 8000 time steps
and the one for minimizing Q as 3000 time steps, which
can obtain the stability value using MTS algorithm.

We start from a network of size N = 100, 200, 300,
400, 500 and the average degree hki = 6 and then per-
form the optimization precesses. At each time step, we
record the structural properties, such as D, C, r and
average node betweenness, when the objective function
Q is reduced. Let Dmin, Cmin rmin and Bmin
max denote
the stable value when Q reaches its minimal value Qmin,
and Dmax, Cmax, rmax and Bmax
max denote the stable value
when Q reaches its maximal value Qmax. Deﬁne the rel-
ative diversity function of the structural character x as

far from its optimal synchronizability state, which means
x is more relevant to network synchronizability.

Figure 1. (a) demonstrates that D remains stable when

Figure 1. (b), (c) show C and r decrease to a stable value
when maximizing and minimizing Q, and Cmax and rmax
are both smaller than Cmin and rmin. The diﬀerence be-
tween Cmin and Cmax, rmin and rmax means that the
two structural characters are relevant to synchronizabil-
ity of scale-free networks. Figure 1. (d) gives the change
trend of average node betweenness when maximizing and
minimizing Q, which is consistent with D. Figure 2. (a)-
(d) demonstrate the stable value of D, C, r and Bmax
when N = 100, 200, 300, 400, 500. From Fig.2, one can
obtain that when N = 500, f (D) = 1.27, f (C) = 20.97
and f (r) = 1.27 and f (Bmax) = 19.04. Moreover, one
can see that the relative diversity of C, r and Bmax be-
come large, while the one of D remain constant, which
indicates that the inﬂuence produced by the structural
characters C, r and Bmax to synchronizability of scale-
free networks would become great when N become large.
Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between av-
erage degree hki and f (x). Figure 3 demonstrats the
Qmin obtained by MTS algorithm to diﬀerent hki when
N = 500. The inset gives the functions of the structural
characters obtained by diﬀerent hki. From the inset, one
can see that if hki increase, the function of D, r and
Bmax increases while the function of C decreases, which
means that the inﬂuence of the structural characters to
network synchronizability is aﬀected by hki. When hki
increases, Bmax, D and r become more relevant to syn-
chronizability of scale-free networks, while C become less
relevant.

In summary, using the MTS optimal algorithm, we
maximized and minimized the network synchronizabil-
ity by changing the connection pattern between diﬀer-
ent pairs of nodes while keeping the degree variance un-
changed. Starting from extensional BA networks, we
found the relationship between structural characters and
synchronizability of scale-free networks. The numerical
results indicate that D, C, r and Bmax inﬂuence net-
work synchronizability simultaneously. Especially, C and
Bmax are the two most important structural characters
which aﬀect synchronizability of scale-free networks, as-
sortative coeﬃcient r is the secondary character and D is
the last one. Furthermore, the relationship is aﬀected by
the average degree hki, and the maximal synchronizabil-
ity of scale-free networks increases when hki increases.

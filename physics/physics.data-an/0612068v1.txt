We examine from an economic view the possible factors that can aﬀect the number of links with
other stocks in a stock network by a cross-correlation-based method, a minimal spanning tree(MST),
using individual stocks in American(S&P 500) and Korean(KOSPI) stock markets. Among the well
known common factors in the ﬁnancial ﬁeld, the market index has been identiﬁed as a possible one.
We have found a power-law behavior in topological properties of the stock network where the degree
distribution obtained through the cross-correlation-based MST method exhibits a power-law with
an exponent ζ ∼ 2.1, for all stock markets explored. Furthermore, in a degree distribution, the
relationship between the number of links with other stocks and the correlation between the market
index and individual stocks follows a power-law distribution. This suggests that the number of links
with other stocks is signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the market index. That is, the stocks with a large
number of links in a stock network are more strongly correlated with the market index than those
with a small number of links.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Recently, researchers from diverse disciplines are interested in exploring the topological properties of networks. In
particular, the network observed in natural and social science shows a variety of topological properties that diﬀer
from those of random graphs [1-3]. The economic world, known as one of the most complex networks, evolves through
interactions between heterogeneous units. The stock market is an example. The prices of individual stocks are formed
by a complex evolution process of diverse information generated inside the market and outside, and these have strong
correlations with each other due to common factors in the market [4]. In other words, individual stocks are correlated
with each other and companies with the same properties tend to be grouped into a community, that is, a homogeneous
group. To investigate these properties, Mantegna et al. proposed the minimal spanning tree(MST) method, which
can be used to observe the grouping process of individual stocks on the basis of the cross-correlation between stocks
[5-7]. They constructed a stock network visually using the MST method and discovered that this generated stock
network had an economically signiﬁcant grouping process.

The various studies of the past several years have shown that the degree distribution of the stock network generated
by the MST method follows a power-law distribution with the exponent ζ ∼ 2 [8-9]. This implies that most individual
stocks in a network have a small number of links with other stocks, while a few stocks have a large number of links.
The previous results also discovered that stocks in a network tend to gather around homogeneous industries or sectors
[10-12], while some results presented contrary evidences [13]. The application of the MST method to portfolio theory,
such as Markowitz’s classical eﬃcient portfolio, found that stocks with a positive weight for the diversiﬁcation aspect
of portfolio optimization are always located on the outskirts of the stock network [14]. That is to say, these stocks are
more aﬀected by speciﬁc ﬁrm factors than common factors, such as the market index, in the mean-variance dimension
of the stock market. However, until recently, there have been not enough studies on the possible factors that can
aﬀect the number of links with other stocks from an economic view. We use the cross-correlation-based MST method
introduced by Mantegna in order to examine the topological properties of the stock network. In addition, we also
consider the market index as a possible factor that can aﬀect the number of links with other stocks in a network. That
is, we want to investigate whether the number of links with other stocks in a network is attributable to the strength
of the relationship between an individual stock and the market index. We used data of individual stocks listed on

diﬀerent stock markets, such as 400 individual stocks in the S&P 500 market index from January 1993 to May 2005,
and 468 individual stocks in the KOSPI market index from January 1991 to May 2003.

We found that the cross-correlation distribution between 400 individual stocks for S&P 500 is very similar to that
for KOSPI. We also found as in the previous work, the degree distribution in a stock network follows a power-law
distribution with an exponent ζ ∼ 2.1, for all stock market explored. Furthermore, we found that the relationship
between the number of links with other stocks and the correlation between the market index and individual stocks
is positive, and follows a power-law distribution hρiM (k)i ∼ kγ, where the exponents are calculated to be γS&P 500 ∼
0.16 and γKOSP I ∼ 0.14, for the S&P 500 and KOSPI market index, respectively. These results suggest that the
number of links in a stock network is signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the strength of the correlation with the market index,
for each of the markets explored. That is, stocks with a large number of links with other stocks in a network using a
MST are more highly related to the market index than those with a small number of links.

In the next section, we will brieﬂy explain the ﬁnancial data and the methods we used. In section III, we present

the analysis of ﬁnancial data with various methods. In the ﬁnal section, we summarize the ﬁndings brieﬂy.

II. DATA AND METHODS

We used individual stocks listed on diﬀerent stock markets for robustness of observed results, such as the daily
prices of 400 individual stocks in the S&P 500 index of the American stock market from January 1993 to May 2005,
and the daily prices of 468 individual stocks in the KOSPI index of the Korean stock market from January 1991 to
May 2003. In addition, we used the S&P 500 and KOSPI market indices from the same period, respectively.

Mantegna et al. proposed a cross-correlation-based method which can detect essential topological information about
the market. We constructed a stock network using a MST based on cross-correlation, using 400 S&P 500 stocks and
468 KOSPI stocks, respectively. The cross-correlation coeﬃcient ρi,j between the stock return i and j is given by

ρi,j ≡

hrirji − hriihrj i
2
i i − hrii

)(hr2

j i − hrji

,

2

)

q(hr2

where rj is the time series of the log-diﬀerence return rj,t = ln Pj(t) − ln Pj (t − 1), and Pj(t) is the stock price j at
the trading time t. The notation h.i means an average over time. This cross-correlation coeﬃcient can vary between
−1 ≤ ρi,j ≤ +1, where ρi,j = −1 denotes completely anti-correlated stocks and ρi,j = 1, completely correlated stocks.
In the case of ρi,j = 0, the stocks i and j are uncorrelated. The cross-correlation coeﬃcients form a symmetric N × N
matrix with diagonal elements equal to unity. Therefore, N (N − 1)/2 cross-correlation coeﬃcients characterizes the
cross-correlation coeﬃcient matrix completely.

The metric distance, introduced by Mantegna, relates the distance of two stocks to their cross-correlation coeﬃcient

[15],

di,j = q2(1 − ρi,j).

This distance can vary between 0 ≤ di,j ≤ 2, where small values imply strong cross-correlations between stocks. In
addition, this distance matrix can be used to construct stock networks using essential information of the market. The
MST network has N − 1 links connecting N nodes, where the nodes represent stocks and the links are chosen so that
the sum of all distances is minimal. The MST, a theoretical concept in the graph theory [16], is the spanning tree of
the shortest length, that is, a graph without a cycle connecting all N nodes with N − 1 links. This method is known
as single linkage cluster analysis in multivariate statistics [17].

In order to ﬁnd out the possible factors that can aﬀect the number of links with other stocks in a network using a
MST, we consider the market index in terms of a possible factor. That is, we investigate whether the strength of the
relationship between individual stocks and the market index can aﬀect the determination of the number of links with
other stocks. Using Equation(1), the cross-correlation between an individual stock, rj , and the market index, rM is
calculated as follows:

ρj,M ≡

hrj rM i − hrj ihrM i

.

q(hr2

2
j i − hrj i

)(hr2

2
M i − hrM i

)

Using this coeﬃcient ρj,M , we can investigate the relationship between the number of links with other stocks in a
network. That is, it sheds a light into whether the strength of correlation with the market index is a possible factor
in the degree distribution of a stock network.

III. RESULTS

3

In this section, using the correlation-based MST method, we investigate the topological properties of a stock network
of 400 individual stocks in the S&P 500 market index from January 1993 to May 2005, and 468 individual stocks in
the KOSPI market index from January 1991 to May 2003, respectively.

First, we present a distribution of the cross-correlation matrix, ρi,j for individual stocks for S&P 500 and KOSPI
indices. In Fig.1, we show the distribution of the cross-correlation matrix. In the ﬁgure, the squares((cid:3), blue) and
circles((cid:13), red) refer to the distribution of the cross-correlation by the stocks in the S&P 500 index and KOSPI index,
respectively. We also show the cross-correlation distribution of the surrogated time series created by method proposed
by Theiler et al. [18] for both stock market. In the ﬁgure, the triangles(△, black) and diamonds(♦, green) indicate
the distribution of cross-correlation by the surrogated time series for S&P 500 and KOSPI, respectively. In Fig 1, the
cross-correlation distribution between stocks in the S&P 500 index is very similar to that of stocks in the KOSPI index,
but they deviate from the cross-correlation distribution of the surrogated time series. Next, in order to investigate
the topological properties of the stock network for both stock markets, we employ the cross-correlation-based MST
method proposed by the Mantegna. Using stock returns of the whole period for both stock markets, we present the
stock network generated by the MST method and degree distribution. Fig. 2 (a) and (b) show the stock networks
for 400 stocks in the S&P 500 index and 468 stocks in the KOSPI index, respectively. In addition, Fig. 2 (c) and (d)
show the degree distributions for both stock markets in a log-log and linear-log plot, respectively. In the ﬁgure, the
squares((cid:3), blue) and circles((cid:13), red) refer to the degree distribution of stocks for S&P 500 and KOSPI, respectively.
We also present the degree distribution of surrogated time series for the both market. In the ﬁgure, the triangles(△,
black) and diamonds(♦, green) indicate the degree distribution of the stock network using the surrogated time series
of S&P 500 and KOSPI, respectively.

We show that the degree distributions for both stock markets follows a power-law distribution with an exponent
ζ ∼ 2.1, while those for the surrogated time series follow an exponential distribution with an exponent δ ∼ 0.77. The
scale-free property of the stock network implies that most stocks have a few links, while only a few stocks have a very
large number of links, acting as a hub for clusters in the stock network.

Then, in order to examine the possible factors that can aﬀect the number of links with other stocks in a network,

we consider the market index in terms of a possible factor. That is, we investigate whether the degree distribution
in a stock network is attributable to the strength of the relationship between an individual stock and the market
index. In Fig.3, we show the relationship between the cross-correlation ρi,M and the degree distribution k for both
stock markets in a log-log plot. In the ﬁgure, the squares((cid:3), blue) and circles((cid:13), red) refer to the relationship for
S&P 500 and KOSPI, respectively. We ﬁnd that the relationship between the number of links with other stocks and
the correlation between the market index and individual stocks follow a power-law distribution hρjM (k)i ∼ kγ, where
the exponents are calculated to be γS&P 500 ∼ 0.16 and γKOSP I ∼ 0.14, respectively. As a result, we observed that
the degree distribution in a stock network is signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the market index. That is, stocks with a large
number of links with other stocks in a network are more highly correlated with the market index than those with a
small number of links. These results suggest that some stocks that act as a hub for clusters in a network are aﬀected
more by the market index, while some stocks with a small number of links, located on the outskirts of the stock
network, are aﬀected less by the market index.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we use the cross-correlation-based MST method introduced by Mantegna in order to examine the
topological properties of the stock network. Furthermore, the market index has been studied as a possible factor that
can aﬀect the number of links with other stocks in a network. That is, we have investigated whether the number of
links with other stocks in a network is attributable to the strength of the relationship between an individual stock

and the market index. We used data of individual stocks listed on diﬀerent stock markets, such as 400 individual
stocks in the S&P 500 market index from January 1993 to May 2005, and 468 individual stocks in the KOSPI from
January 1991 to May 2003.

We have discovered that the cross-correlation distribution between stocks in the S&P 500 index is very similar to
that of stocks in the KOSPI index. We also found as in the previous research, the degree distribution in a stock
network follows a power-law distribution with an exponent ζ ∼ 2.1, for American and Korean stock markets, while
those for the surrogated time series follow an exponential distribution with an exponent δ ∼ 0.77. Furthermore,
we found that the relationship between the degree distribution and the correlation between the market index and
individual stocks follows a power-law distribution with the exponents γS&P 500 ∼ 0.16 and γKOSP I ∼ 0.14. As a result,
the number of links with other stocks are signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the market index. Our ﬁndings imply that the
degree is the most important quantity to describe the topological properties of a network, due to its close relationship
with the market index, and is conﬁrmed as a well-established common factor in a ﬁnancial market.

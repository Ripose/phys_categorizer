Abstract

Stochastic neutron transport theory is applied to the derivation of the two-neutron-
detectors cross power spectral density for subcritical assemblies when external pulsed
sources are used. A general relationship between the two-detector probability gene-
rating functions of the kernel and the source is obtained considering the contribution
to detectors statistics of both the pulsed source and the intrinsic neutron source. An
expansion in α-eigenvalues is derived for the ﬁnal solution, which permits to take
into account the eﬀect of higher harmonics in subcritical systems. Further, expres-
sions corresponding to the fundamental mode approximation are compared with
recent results from experiments performed under the MUSE-4 European research
project.

1 Introduction

In last years, researchers have shown an increasing interest on the conceptual
development of accelerator-driven systems (ADS) for nuclear waste transmuta-
tion and energy production purposes. An important issue regarding its future
industrial applicability is the development of a periodically subcriticality level
measurement and monitoring technique, since both its operation safety and

its performance as a part of the nuclear fuel cycle shall be seriously aﬀected
by this variable.

Following the study of the neutron ﬂuctuations in a multiplying medium,
Courant and Wallace (1947), several static and dynamic methods have been
proposed and studied for years concerning their applicability for the determi-
nation of some nuclear reactor physics parameters (see Uhrig (1970); Williams
(1974); Lewins (1978); Carta and D’Angelo (1999)). Within the group of dy-
namic techniques, apparently the utilisation of the neutron-ﬁssion chain ﬂuctu-
ations for nuclear assemblies subcriticality determination was ﬁrstly suggested
by Bruno Rossi (the Rossi-α method). In these methods neutron detector
counting rates related to individual ﬁssion-chain events must be discerned
from the total counting rate, therefore these methods are applicable to sub-
critical systems near delayed critical conditions, Carta and D’Angelo (1999).

Further, dynamic methods based on a time-dependent external neutron source
were proposed by Perez et al. (1964). Recently, the use of these methods has
increased during the MUSE European experimental studies carried out at the
MASURCA facility (Cadarache, France) due to their applicability in order to
investigate ADS kinetic parameters. In these experiments D-D and D-T neu-
tron sources running in pulsed mode have been used, although the utilisation
of an external spallation proton source has also been thought. Anyway, mea-
surements can be done in two diﬀerent ways (Valentine et al. (2000); Degweker
(2003); Ceder and P´azsit (2003)): in the ﬁrst one, the neutron detector time
gate is synchronized with the external neutron pulse injection, thus this me-
thod is referred to as deterministic pulsing method, whereas, in the second
case, the relative delay between the neutron pulse injection and the begin-
ning of the neutron counting time is uniformly sampled between zero and the
pulsed source period, which is known as stochastic pulsing method. For the
latter case, the neutron source can be assumed to have the form

S (t) = k

δ (t − (ξ + mT )) ,

(1)

∞

m=−∞
X

where k is the number of protons injected per proton pulse, T is the pulsed
source period, and ξ is uniformly sampled within the time interval [0, T ].
Obviously, for the deterministic pulsing method we will put ξ = 0.

On the other hand, P´al (1958) developed a general theory for the study of
the stochastic neutron ﬁeld. This model, complemented afterwards by Bell
(1965), completely describe the stochastic neutron ﬁeld in a ﬁssile assembly.
Later, Mu˜noz-Cobo et al. (1987) derived expressions for the variance of the
number of counts in a detector and the CPSD for a Poissonian source without
delayed neutrons from the general neutron stochastic transport theory. These
approaches permit to go beyond classical point kinetic approximations, taking

2

into consideration general problems with spatial, spectral, and angular depen-
dence. They have been extensively applied to nuclear subcriticality safety and
non-destructive nuclear fuel assay problems.

Classical reactor noise methods are not correct when pulsed or correlated
sources are used (Matthes et al. (1988); Behringer and Wydler (1999)). For
these kind of sources, forward Kolmogorov’s approach is not valid because
of the non-Markovian character of the process, while backward Green’s func-
tion description needs to go beyond Poissonian behaviour (Degweker (2003);
Ballester and Mu˜noz-Cobo (2005)).

In our work we have derived a relationship between the source probability
generating function and the kernel probability generating function when non-
Poissonian spallation neutron sources are considered. We have also studied
the eﬀect of the intrinsic neutron source due to spontaneous ﬁssion occur-
ring in major actinides forming part of the nuclear fuel of an ADS. This
result can considered as a generalisation of the master equation obtained by
Ballester and Mu˜noz-Cobo (2005) for cross statistical descriptors (problems
with more than one detector).

In particular, we admit the intrinsic source spontaneous ﬁssion process to
behave as a Poissonian one, albeit neutron emission multiplicity corresponding
to spontaneous ﬁssion events has also been included.

In this paper we have neglected the contribution of delayed neutrons, therefore
all quantities appearing here can be interpreted as prompt variables for short
time-scales, in comparison with the delayed neutron precursors lifetimes.

2 General expression for the relationship between the source pgf

and the kernel pgf

The derivation of the general relationship between the source pgf and the
kernel pgf shall be based on two well known results (see, e.g., Lando (2003)):

• given a random variable, Z = X 1 + X2 + . . . + Xn, Xi, i = 1, 2, . . . , n, being
j sjPXi=j
mutually independent discrete random variables, and GXi(s) =
being the probability generating function associated to Xi, where PXi=j is
P
j PXi=j = 1, then
the probability for the occurrence of the event Xi = j,
the probability generating function of Z can be expressed as

P

GZ (s) =

GXi (s) ;

i
Y

(2)

• given a random variable Z = X1 + X2 + . . . + XY , X ≡ Xi ∀i and Y being

3

mutually independent discrete random variables, then

GZ (s) = GY (GX (s)) .

(3)

In our system we must consider two independent sources leading to detector
counts, Ballester and Mu˜noz-Cobo (2005): neutrons appearing from sponta-
neous ﬁssion of isotopes contained within the nuclear fuel, and neutrons com-
ing from the spallation source induced by nuclear interactions of the proton
beam with the target material.

In particular, for the derivation of the cross correlation between two neutron
detectors, we shall consider the two-dimensional discrete random variable Z =
(Z1, Z2), where Zi, i = 1, 2, is the number of neutron detections gathered by
the i-th detector during the time interval (tfi − τci, tfi). And according to our
previous discussion, Zi = Ni+Mi, where Ni, Mi, are the number of detections
registered by the i-th detector and coming from the intrinsic spontaneous
ﬁssion source and the external pulsed source, respectively; equivalently, N =
(N1, N2), M = (M1, M2).

In case of the intrinsic spontaneous ﬁssions source, the number of detector
counts within the time interval (tfi − τci, tfi), Ni, can be expressed as

Ni = Xi1 + Xi2 + . . . + XiY ,

(4)

where Y is the number of spontaneous ﬁssion events occurring within the
fuel material and Xij ≡ Xi is the number of detector counts gathered by
the i-th detector corresponding to each spontaneous ﬁssion event, both being
mutually independent discrete random variables, Ballester and Mu˜noz-Cobo
(2005); its corresponding two-dimensional discrete random variable will be
denoted as X = (X1, X2). We can deﬁne the following probability functions:
Pn1n2 (d1 (tf1) , d2 (tf2)) is the joint probability to have Ni = ni, i = 1, 2, detec-
tor counts within the time interval (tfi − τci, tfi) upon the introduction of the
neutron intrinsic source in the remote past, Py (tf) is the probability to have
Y = y intrinsic source spontaneous ﬁssion events within the fuel material at
time tf = max {tf1, tf2} upon the introduction of this neutron source in the re-
mote past, Px1x2 (r, t|d1 (tf1) , d2 (tf2)) is the joint probability to have Xi = xi,
i = 1, 2, counts in the i-th detector within the time interval (tfi − τci, tfi)
after an intrinsic source disintegration event at time t and position r. In ad-
dition, Kn1n2 (ϑ, t|d1 (tf1) , d2 (tf2)) is the joint probability of having Ni = ni,
i = 1, 2, detector counts per single neutron injected in the phase-space point
ϑ = (r, v, Ω) at instant t. Associated with these probabilities we have the
source probability generating functions

If we apply the result given by equation (3) and consider the fact that the
spontaneous ﬁssion neutron source will behave as a Poissonian source, then
we ﬁnd that (Bell (1965); Ballester and Mu˜noz-Cobo (2005))

where we have supposed the source, which is given by the product of its time
dependent activity, λsfN (t), and the shape probability distribution function
ρsf (r), to be introduced in the remote past. In addition, the relationship be-
tween the spontaneous disintegration source probability generating function
and the kernel probability generating function is given by (Mu˜noz-Cobo et al.

On the other hand, in order to obtain the relationship applicable for the
proton-beam-driven spallation neutron source we can proceed in the follow-
ing way: ﬁrstly, let us consider the expression for the joint probability to
register Mi = mi, i = 1, 2, neutron counts in each neutron detector during
the corresponding detector time interval (tfi − τci, tfi) following the injection

With this expression and taking into account the relationships expressed at
the beginning of this Section, and admitting that the number of detector
counts after the introduction of each proton belonging to the same source
pulse can be considered as independent discrete random variables, we can
derive the relationship between the spallation source and the kernel probability
generating functions for the injection of k protons in one proton pulse (pp) at

But, in general, the number of protons injected per accelerator pulse might
be considered to be a discrete random variable, thus, the correct expression
for the relationship between the spallation source and the kernel pgfs for the
injection of one proton pulse can be recast as

Gpp (s1, s2, ξ|d1 (tf1) , d2 (tf2)) =

εpp
k Gpp,k (s1, s2, ξ|d1 (tf1) , d2 (tf2)) ,(15)

where εpp
is the probability for the accelerator to inject k protons per proton
k
pulse and Ipp is the maximum number of protons that can be introduced in
the system per proton pulse.

Considering this expression, for a periodic pulsed proton source such as that
one given by equation (1), we will have

S (s1, s2, ξ|d1 (tf1) , d2 (tf2)) =

Gpp (s1, s2, ξ + mT |d1 (tf1) , d2 (tf2)) .

In general, neutron detectors will register counts coming from both, sponta-
neous ﬁssion and spallation, sources which can be treated as mutually indepen-
dent random variables (Ballester and Mu˜noz-Cobo (2005)), thus the probabil-
ity generating function governing both processes will be given by the product
of equations (10) and (16), that is,

GS (s1, s2, ξ|d1 (tf1) , d2 (tf2))

= Gsf

S (s1, s2|d1 (tf1) , d2 (tf2)) × Gsp

S (s1, s2, ξ|d1 (tf1) , d2 (tf2)) .

This last equation expresses the relationship between the source probability
generating function and the kernel probability generating function when we
consider the eﬀect of the intrinsic spontaneous ﬁssion source and the periodic
pulsed spallation neutron source, Ballester and Mu˜noz-Cobo (2005). In partic-
ular, for the deterministic pulsed method we just need to choose the elapsed
time ξ equal to zero, whereas, in order to apply the stochastic pulsing me-
thod we will calculate the expected value of (17), ξ being uniformly sampled
between zero and the proton pulse period, T , i.e.,

GS (s1, s2|d1 (tf1) , d2 (tf2)) = hGS (s1, s2, ξ|d1 (tf1) , d2 (tf2))iξ

3 The Boltzmann neutron transport equation for counting pro-

blems from the stochastic neutron transport theory

In this Section we derive the integro-diﬀerential equation governing the kernel
probability generating function GK (s1, s2, ϑ, ξ|d1 (tf1) , d2 (tf2)). First of all, we
need to obtain an expression for the probability function Kz1z2 (ϑ, t|d1 (tf1) , d2 (tf2))
for both neutron detectors. It can be done using a probability balance of
mutually exclusive events (Mu˜noz-Cobo et al. (1987, 2000)). Then we shall
multiply the probability balance equation of Kz1z2 (ϑ, t|d1 (tf1) , d2 (tf2)) by the
factor sz1
2 and then sum up from z1, z2 = 0 to ∞. Next, we need to apply
the known P´al’s methodology (see P´al (1958); Bell (1965); Mu˜noz-Cobo et al.
(1987)) to obtain the non-linear transport integro-diﬀerential equation satis-
ﬁed by the kernel probability generating function, Mu˜noz-Cobo et al. (1987):

Further, according to Bartlett’s procedure, Bartlett (1955), we can derive the
ﬁrst factorial moment of the number of detector counts per single neutron
injected in the system at the phase-space point ϑ and at time t as

¯zi (ϑ, t|d (tf )) =

(cid:12)
(cid:12)

whereas the cross second factorial moment of the number of detector counts
per single neutron injected can be deﬁned as

This magnitude will be non-zero only for r ∈ VDi and t ∈ (tfi − τci, tfi].

The solution ¯zi of equation (30) must fulﬁl the boundary condition ¯zi = 0
for n · Ω > 0, on a convex boundary, and the time-reversed causality condi-
tion, i.e., it must vanish at the end of the measurement period τci. Indeed,
equation (30) reveals the nature of ¯zi as an adjoint generalised Green’s func-
tion driven by the adjoint importance source S+

Now, the forward neutron ﬂux satisﬁes the initial condition φ (t = −∞) = 0,
and the boundary condition φ = 0 for n · Ω < 0, on a convex boundary.
A proper choice of the corresponding boundary and ﬁnal conditions for the
adjoint function makes the associated bilinear concomittance to vanish, and,
hence, due to the commutation relation

where Dirac’s notation for the inner product is used, and where both terms
account for the average number of detector counts during its counting interval:
at the left hand side we have the inner product of the neutron source strength,
S1, (neutrons emitted at a given phase-space point and time) and the number
of counts gathered at detector i per single neutron introduced at a given phase-
space point and time, ¯zi; equivalently, the right hand side term expresses the
inner product of the eﬀective macroscopic neutron detection cross section for
the same detector, S+

Di, and the neutron ﬂux, φ, Mu˜noz-Cobo et al. (2000).

Similarly, we can make use of (29) to ﬁnd an expression for the cross sec-

The cross second factorial moment z1z2 must satisfy the same time-reversed
and boundary conditions as ¯zi, but for tf = max{tf1, tf2}. Hence, it can be
viewed as a generalised adjoint function, now driven by the adjoint source,
S+
D1D2, that is, the product of the detector cross sections and the spectral and
angular weighted neutron importances. Again, the commutation relation leads
to the identity

Next, we look for a solution to the Boltzmann neutron transport equation (32)

φ (ϑ, t) = φsf (ϑ, t) + φsp (ϑ, t) =

ϕj (ϑ) ζj (t) ,

where we assume the eigenfunctions ϕj (ϑ) to form a complete basis in the
corresponding Hilbert space (Bell and Glasstone (1979); Carta and D’Angelo
(1999)). These must obey the α-eigenvalue equation

4 Analytical expression for the cross power spectral density with

pulsed sources

4.1 The deterministic pulsing method

In order to obtain the analytical expressions corresponding to the factorial
moments of the number of counts of both neutron detectors we can apply
again Bartlett’s procedure (Bartlett (1955)) to the expression corresponding
to the source probability generating function. As we have outlined previously,
we can do it taking into account two diﬀerent situations: in the ﬁrst case,
we can calculate factorial moments corresponding to the deterministic pulsing
method.

We are interested in the well known cross covariance function, Papoulis (1991),
deﬁned as

Ξ (d1 (tf1) , d2 (tf2)) =

s1,s2=1

(57)

where GS ≡ GS (s1, s2|d1 (tf1) , d2 (tf2)) is given by (17) with ξ = 0, i.e., it
is the diﬀerence between the cross second factorial moment of the number
of detector counts gathered by both detectors and the product of their ﬁrst
factorial moments. It can be recast as

Ξ (d1 (tf1) , d2 (tf2)) = hS+

D1D2|φi (d1 (tf1) , d2 (tf2)) + ∆Ξ (d1 (tf1) , d2 (tf2)) , (58)

where the ﬁrst term takes into account the contribution coming from multi-
plicative processes within the system and the detector volumes due to ﬁssion
events and detections. The latter can be de facto neglected if we admit that the
volume occupied by detectors is small in comparison with the system volume.
In addition, the second term in (58) stems from the non-Poissonian behaviour
of both neutron sources.

Next we can divide equation (58) by τc1τc2 and then apply the limits limτc1 ,τc2 ↓0
in order to derive the expression corresponding to the second order instanta-
neous rate of the cross covariance function:

¨Ξ (t − tf1, t − tf2) = h ¨S+

D1D2|φi (t − tf1, t − tf2) + ∆¨Ξ (t − tf1, t − tf2) ,

Without loss of generality, we can assume that the upper integral limit in (57)

tf → ∞. Next, we can deﬁne the time delay between the ﬁnal instant of both
dτ exp (−iωτ )
detector intervals as τ = tf2 − tf1, and then apply the operator
to equation (59) to derive the Fourier transform of ¨Ξ (t − tf1, t − tf2), i.e., the

(2005)) and, obviously it only involves the pulsed neutron source.

The cross power spectral density shall be derived following the same steps as
before, i.e., dividing equation (77) by τc1τc2, then applying the limits limτc1 ,τc2 ↓0

Equation (85) apparently seems to be similar to that obtained by Rugama et al.
(2004) albeit a deeper examination permits to understand an important dif-
ference: in the latter case, the expression for the CPSD for the stochastic puls-
ing method was derived assuming a quasi-Poissonian behaviour of the pulsed
external source, i.e., with no delay time averaging. That means that the ex-
pression obtained in this reference should be exactly equal to our expression
for the CPSD in Section 4 under the deterministic pulsing method, only with-
out the contribution of (75), which stems from the non-Poissonian behaviour
of the periodic pulsed source. But it is clear that, in any case, equation (69)
is a completely bounded function for any non-zero value of the frequency, ω,
which cannot produce the response obtained at MUSE-4 experiments, also

reported by Rugama et al. (2004), for the stochastic pulsing CPSD method.
Unlikely, we have shown that those spectral lines appearing at frequencies
which are multiples of the accelerator frequency are indeed not produced by
the system cross covariance contribution, but they are a prima facie of the
time self-correlation introduced by the stochastic pulsing method.

In addition, it has been recently shown that the utilisation of determinis-
tic external pulsed sources, such as those used in MUSE-4 experiments, can
make the nuclear process to behave as a sub-Poissonian one, Ballester et al.
(2005). It can occur when the contribution of non-Poissonian term of the
pulsed source becomes negative. That means that under those conditions the
time-independent term ̺1 can be eﬀectively negative for very deterministic
pulsed sources. But, anyway, it is of common practice to use Bode’s diagram
of the magnitude in order to represent graphically a system response function
such as (85), therefore, it is not necessary to consider the sign of ̺1 provided
that, from a practical viewpoint, we only need to ﬁt its magnitude for those
points of the graph where ω is not a multiple of the accelerator frequency,
together with the eigenvalue α0. Notice that the value of ̺2 cannot be de-
termined from this technique (we will need a further integral condition), but
in any case it is completely useless for a practical purpose. That means that
when the stochastic pulsing CPSD method is applied to determine the value
of the subcriticality level of a nuclear system, only two ﬁtting parameters must
be considered, in contrast with the stochastic pulsing Feynman-α technique,
where three parameters must be ﬁtted, Ballester et al. (2005).

In Figure 1 we show some experimental points reported in that graph cor-
responding to the stochastic pulsing CPSD method of Rugama et al. (2004)
(Figure 6), together with equation (85) conveniently ﬁtted. This particular
experiment, corresponds to the conﬁguration SC0 of the MASURCA subcrit-
ical assembly used during MUSE-4 studies, Soule et al. (2004), with a D-D
pulsed source. The value of the prompt neutron time constant obtained by
Rugama et al. (2004), which is shown in Table 1, is eﬀectively very similar to
that reported using other noise techniques for the same conditions.

6 Conclusions

In the present work we have dealt with the applicability of stochastic-neutron-
ﬁeld-based methods for the study of the neutron counting statistics in a nuclear
system. We have derived the generalised two-detectors relationship between
the probability generating functions of the kernel and the source for sub-
critical assemblies when pulsed neutron sources are used together with the
intrinsic neutron source coming from spontaneous ﬁssion events within the
fuel material, Ballester and Mu˜noz-Cobo (2005). It has been done within the
stochastic neutron transport theory framework, which permits to understand
how the general transport problem is inﬂuenced by its spatial, spectral and
angular dependence.

Further, we have followed P´al-Bell’s methodology for the derivation of the
integro-diﬀerential Boltzmann transport equation, and applied the formalism
described by Mu˜noz-Cobo et al. (1987) in order to calculate the chosen sta-
tistical descriptor.

In Section 4 an expansion in α-eigenvalues for the cross covariance and the
CPSD of two-detectors stochastic counting rates have been obtained. The
contribution of higher harmonics in subcritical monitoring problems shall play
an important role in ADS assemblies. In this case, the excitement of higher
modes could be relevant in situations of normal operation, and it will increase
as the reactor departs from the criticality condition.

In Section 5 we have compared the expression obtained for the stochastic
pulsing CPSD method with experimental data obtained during the MUSE-4
European project. The value of the prompt neutron time constant ﬁtted is

23

comparable with others methods. In addition, the reduced number of ﬁtting
parameters makes this method suitable as a subcriticality monitoring tech-
nique.

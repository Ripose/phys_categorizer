Abstract

We study the functional link between the Hurst parameter and the Normalized Total
Wavelet Entropy when analyzing fractional Brownian motion (fBm) time series—
these series are synthetically generated. Both quantiﬁers are mainly used to identify
fractional Brownian motion processes (Fractals 12 (2004) 223). The aim of this work
is understand the diﬀerences in the information obtained from them, if any.

1 Introduction

When studying the laser beam propagation through a laboratory-generated
turbulence [1] we have introduced two quantiﬁers: the Hurst parameter, H, and

the Normalized Total Wavelet Entropy (NTWS), SWT. The former quantiﬁer
was introduced to test how good the family of fractional Brownian motion [2]
(fBm) processes model the wandering of such laser beam, while the NTWS is
a more general quantiﬁer aimed to study any given dynamic system [3]. Also,
in a recent work we have analyzed the dynamic case: the laboratory-generated
turbulence was set up to change in time [4]. We have observed that these
quantiﬁers are correlated, but at the time only a qualitative argument was
given. Furthermore, each one of these quantiﬁers have been used separately
to obtain information from biospeckle phenomenon [5, 6].

The fBm is the only one family of processes which are self-similar, with sta-
tionary increments, and gaussian [7]. The normalized family of these gaussian
processes, BH, is the one with BH (0) = 0 almost surely, E[BH (t)] = 0, and
covariance

for s, t ∈ R. Here E[ ·] refers to the average with gaussian probability density.
The power exponent H has a bounded range between 0 and 1. These processes
exhibit memory, as can be observed from Eq. (1), for any Hurst paremeter but
H = 1/2. In this case successive Brownian motion increments are as likely to
have the same sign as the opposite, and thus there is no correlation. Oth-
erwise, it is the Brownian motion that splits the family of fBm processes in
two. When H > 1/2 the correlations of successive increments decay hyperboli-
cally, and this sub-family of processes have long-memory. Besides, consecutive
increments tend to have the same sign, these processes are persistent. For
H < 1/2, the correlations of the increments also decay but exponentially, and
this sub-family presents short-memory. But since consecutive increments are
more likely to have opposite signs, it is said that these are anti-persitent.

The Wavelet Analysis is one of the most useful tools when dealing with data
samples. Thus, any signal can be descomposed by using a diadic discrete family
{2j/2ψ(2jt−k)}—an orthonormal basis for L2(R)—of translations and scaling
functions based on a function ψ: the mother wavelet. This wavelet expansion
has associated wavelet coeﬃcients given by Cj(k) = hS, 2j/2ψ(2j · −k)i. Each
resolution level j has an associated energy given by Ej = E |Cj(k)|2. If the
signal has stationary increments the coeﬃcients are independent on k and
then the relative wavelet energy, RWE, is

(2)

with j ∈ {−N, . . . , −1}, where N = log2 M is the number of sample points,
E |Cj|2 is the total energy. Thus the NTWS is deﬁned as
and Etot =

For a signal originated from a fBm the energy per resolution level can be
calculated using the formalism introduced in Ref. [8], see Appendix 3,

which becomes independent on wavelet basis. And so it does the normalized

As it was expected the entropy decreases when H increases, with H measuring
the level of order of the signal.

2 Simulations and tests

To test the functional relation between the Hurst exponent and NTWS we
have simulated 50 fractional Brownian motion data samples [9] for each H ∈
{0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9}. Since we have examined data of 5000
point in length in Ref. [1], these samples are set to the same length. For
each set we estimate H and SWT. Moreover, we employ an orthogonal cubic
spline function as mother wavelet. Among several alternatives, the cubic spline
function is symmetric and combine in a suitable proportion smoothness with
numerical advantages. It has become a recommendable tool for representing
natural signals [10, 11].

The Hurst parameter is estimated as usual: by plotting the logarithm of the

Ej =

Xk=1
with Nj = 2−jM the number of coeﬃcients at resolution level j, versus j and
ﬁtting a minimum square line. The slope of the line is the desired estimator.

b

For NTWS we start dividing the signal into NT non-overlapping temporal win-
dows with length L, NT = M/L. The wavelet energy estimator at resolution
level j for the time window i is given by

E (i)
j =

with i = 1, · · · , NT ,

where Nj represents the number of wavelet coeﬃcients at resolution level j
corresponding to the time window i; while the total energy estimator in this
time window will be

E (i)
tot =

Hence, the time evolution estimators of RWE and NTWS will be given by:

then the total wavelet energy temporal average is deﬁned as hEtoti =
In consequence, a mean probability distribution {qj} representative for the
whole time interval (the complete signal) can be deﬁned as

qj = hEji/hEtoti,

with

j qj = 1 and the corresponding mean NTWS as

In Figure 1 we compare H against its estimator. It has a good performance for
0.3 < H < 0.9 and fails outside. Furthermore, the estimators ﬁts better the
larger values. Figure 2 represents the temporal average of NTWS, hSWTi, and
SW T , estimated with our procedure and compared against
the mean NTWS,
the theoretical result in eq. (6) with N = 12. As usual, boxplots [12] show
lower and upper lines at the lower quartile (25th percentile of the sample) and
upper quartile (75th percentile of the sample) and the line in the middle of
the box is the sample median. The whiskers are lines extending from each end
of the box indicating the extent of the rest of the sample. Outliers are marked
by plus signs. These points may be considered the result of a data entry error
or a poor measurement.

3 Conclusions

For a fBm we have found, eq. (6), there is an inverse dependence: as H grows
the temporal average, hSWTi, and mean NTWS,
SW T , diminishes. It is veriﬁed
with the synthetic fBm data samples. This relation is logical, the spectrum has
less high-frequency components as H gets higher and all the energy is closer
to the origin, and, if H gets lower the energy contribution at high frequencies
becomes relevant. Observe that the closer ˆH is to the exact value, the better
are the results for both estimators of the entropy.

e

From an analytical point of view both H and SWT are equivalent. Although,
the NTWS also contains information about the extension of the data set.
Nevertheless, from a computational point of view the latter is independent
on the scaling region, making the entropy less subjective. On the other hand
the logarithm in the entropy deﬁnition introduces important errors, as we see
in Figure 2. To narrow these it is necessary to increase the data samples. It
should be stressed that extending the length of the data samples reduces the
statistical error.

for the last step we used the self-similar property of the fBm; that is, BH(t) d=

corresponding to the total energy. Its logarithm (base 2) is simply log2 pj =
(1 + 2H)(j + 1) + log2[1 − 2−(1+2H)/1 − 2−N (1+2H)]. Finally, using these results
in the deﬁnition of NTWS, it is

SWT(N, H) =

Abstract

Researchers have used many diﬀerent methods to detect the possibility of long-term dependence

(long memory) in stock market returns, but evidence is in general mixed.

In this paper, three

diﬀerent tests, (namely Rescaled Range (R/S), its modiﬁed form, and the semi-parametric method

(GPH)), in addition to a new approach using the discrete wavelet transform, (DWT), have been

applied to the daily returns of ﬁve Irish Stock Exchange (ISEQ) indices. These methods have

also been applied to the volatility measures (namely absolute and squared returns). The aim is

to investigate the existence of long-term memory properties. The indices are Overall, Financial,

General, Small Cap and ITEQ and the results of these approaches show that there is no evidence of

long-range dependence in the returns themselves, while there is strong evidence for such dependence

in the squared and absolute returns. Moreover, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) provides

additional insight on the series breakdown. In particular, in comparison to other methods, the

beneﬁt of the wavelet transform is that it provides a way to study the sensitivity of the series to

increases in amplitude of ﬂuctuations as well as changes in frequency. Finally, based on results for

these methods, in particular, those for DWT of raw (or original), squared and absolute returns, it

can be concluded that there is strong indication for persistence in the volatilities of the emerging

INTRODUCTION

There is no unique deﬁnition of long-term memory (LTM) processes (ﬁrst introduced in

[1]) which measure long range dependence. Such a process is generally deﬁned as a series

having a slowly declining correlogram or an inﬁnite spectrum at zero frequency (see [2]).

The existence of long-range dependence (LRD) in a stock market has been an important

topic in recent ﬁnancial research as LTM models are able to describe features of data of var-

ious granularities using the same parameters. Several studies ﬁnd evidence of long memory

in stock market returns. ([3], [4] and [5]), while others show that there is none or at best

there is weak evidence ([6], [7], [8], [9], [10] and [11]).

In [12], the author utilized GPH, classical and modiﬁed Rescaled Range (R/S) methods

to test the presence of LTM in the international stock index returns of the G-7 countries and

found no evidence of LTM in these series with the exception of West Germany. Further, the

authors, in [13], applied the Spectral Regression Method to test for long-range dependence

in 10 U.S stock returns, and returns of 30 ﬁrms included in the Dow Jones Industrial Index.

Their results showed no evidence of long memory in these returns, as a whole, but some

evidence for persistence in ﬁve companies while three other ﬁrms exhibited anti-persistence.

In [14], the authors used a Lagrange Multiplier procedure and reported that long memory

exists in the squared returns but not in the returns themselves.

More recently, Elekdag [15] applied GPH methods to volatilities of a large data set of

emerging markets and found strong evidence for LTM in these series. This evidence was

robust to various volatilities, speciﬁcally the absolute and modiﬁed log-squared returns. Fur-

ther, Sibbertsen [16] found signiﬁcant evidence of LTM in the volatilities of several German

stock returns, investigated using the classical and tapered log-periodogram regression meth-

ods. Several articles detail the fact that emerging capital markets are more likely to have

LTM than the major capital markets ([17], [18], [19], [20] and [21]).

It seems clear from the literature, therefore, that the volatilities of stock returns, such as

squared and absolute returns, are more likely to have LTM than the stock returns themselves.

The aim of this paper is twofold; (1) To employ the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) (for

description see, [22], [23] and [24]) as a new testing approach to investigate the existence

of LTM in the returns series and volatilities of ﬁve Irish indices.

(2) To compare DWT

with other methods [namely Rescaled Range (R/S) (introduced in [1]), its modiﬁed form

2

(for detail see [6]) and GPH (suggested in [25])]. We examine Irish index returns, (namely

Overall, Financial, General, Small Cap and ITEQ), in order to determine whether long

memory behaviour is exhibited in any or all of these.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section II the data and results

are described and our conclusion is presented in section III.

II. DATA AND RESULTS

A. Data Overview

The data sets considered in this study are the daily closing values of ﬁve Irish Stock Ex-

change (ISEQ) indices, namely Overall, Financial, General (from 04/1/1988 to 30/9/2003),

Small Cap (from 4/1/1999 to 30/9/2003) and ITEQ (from 4/1/2000 to 30/9/2003). The

daily returns of all these indices are calculated as follows, [Daily Returns= ln(Pt/Pt−1) where

Pt and Pt−1 are the index price at time t and t

1 respectively].

B. Results

The R/S and Lo’s R/S analysis are applied to the index returns and their volatility

measures and the results are reported in Table I. There appears to be little evidence of long

memory property in all returns series themselves (from either method). There is, however,

strong evidence of long-range dependence in the absolute and squared returns of all indices

except in those of the Small Cap index.

Note: V -tests are calculated as Vn = Wn/√n. The acceptance or rejection of the null hypothesis at

α% level for 5% or 1% is determined by whether or not Vn is contained in the interval [0.809,1.862] or

[0.721,2.098] respectively. Thus * and ** indicate statistical signiﬁcance at the 5% and 1% respectively.

The spectral regression procedure (GPH) is also applied to estimate d and to test the

hypothesis (H0 : d = 0 vs. H1 : d

= 0) for index returns and their volatilities. We report the

GPH test for diﬀerent values of α =0.45, 0.50, 0.55, 0.60 in order to measure the sensitivity of
this test to the choice of m (where m = nα). A two-sided test is performed, by constructing
a t-statistic with the theoretical variance of the spectral regression error equal to π2/6, to

test the statistical signiﬁcant of the d estimates. The results are reported in Table II. Based

on this analysis, there is no evidence of long-term memory in any of the returns series and

there is strong indication of persistence in the absolute and the squared returns of all indices,

except that of the Small Cap index. The GPH method shows that the squared returns of the

General index have no long memory behaviour while both R/S tests show that long-range

dependence is strongly exhibited in this series.

While these more conventional analyses are useful, serving to contrast the Irish with

other markets’ data, we now consider the relatively novel approach using the discrete wavelet

transform (DWT) to analyze the volatility more directly. The DWT with symmlet 8 wavelet

(s8) for 6 levels (scales) is computed for daily returns series and their volatility measures (

namely squared and absolute returns) of all Irish indices in order to investigate the long-

term memory property. The DWT provides a more detailed breakdown of the contribution

to the series energy from the high and low frequencies in the following manner. Table III

(Panels: A, B and C) display the energy percentages for wavelet components (crystals) of the

returns, squared and absolute, of Overall, Financial, General, Small Cap and ITEQ indices

respectively. These percentages indicate the proportion of energy in these series explained by

each wavelet crystal. From Table III (Panel A), it can be seen that high-frequency crystals

(especially the ﬁrst and the second) have much more energy than the lowest frequency

one and this means that movements in the returns are mainly caused by the short-term

ﬂuctuations. This conﬁrms that there is little evidence for long memory in the returns

series. Table III (Panel B) shows that the lowest frequency component (s6) of the squared

returns of each of the Overall, Financial and ITEQ indices has more energy than the second

high-frequency component (d2) but less energy than the ﬁrst crystal (d1). This provides

futher detail on previous analysis and implies that movements in these squared returns are

caused by both short-term and long-term ﬂuctuations. Thus there is clear evidence of a long

memory property in the squared returns series. The lowest frequency component (s6) of the

squared returns of the General index has lower energy than the second highest frequency

(d2) but higher than that of the third component, indicative of a weak long memory eﬀect

in the squared returns of General index. However, the energy of the lowest frequency crystal

of the squared returns of Small Cap index is even lower than that of the d3 component

and this clearly implies that the movements of this series are mostly caused by short-term

ﬂuctuations with no signiﬁcant evidence of long-term memory.

ponent (s6) has much more energy than both the ﬁrst (d1) and the second (d2) components

together, which is strong evidence of long-range dependence in the absolute returns series

with movements in these series mostly caused by long-term ﬂuctuations. From the wavelet

analysis it is clear that the frequency patterns are demonstrably diﬀerent for the respective

series where large energy percentages, associated with high frequency components, implies

short-term memory dominance and vice versa.

III. CONCLUSION

In this article, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and three other methods, were

employed to test for the presence of long memory in the ﬁve Irish Stock Exchange (ISEQ)

indices. In agreement with ﬁndings for other indices, (e.g.

[26], [15] and [16]), there is no

evidence of long memory for returns series, while for squared and absolute returns, such a

property does appear to exist. The exception is the Small Cap index for the Irish data,

which shows no signiﬁcant evidence of long-term dependence for any returns series. The

DWT analysis, however, provides additional insight on the series breakdown. In particular,

in comparison to other methods, the beneﬁt of wavelet transform is that it provides a way to

study the sensitivity of the series to increases in amplitude of ﬂuctuations as well as changes

in frequency. Finally, based on results for these methods, in particular, those for DWT of

returns, squared and absolute returns, it can be concluded that there is strong indication

for persistence in the volatilities of the emerging stock market returns for the Irish data.

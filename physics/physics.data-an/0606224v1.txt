We propose a generic model for multiple choice situations in the presence of herding and compare
it with recent empirical results from a Web-based music market experiment. The model predicts
a phase transition between a weak imitation phase and a strong imitation, ‘fashion’ phase, where
choices are driven by peer pressure and the ranking of individual preferences is strongly distorted
at the aggregate level. The model can be calibrated to reproduce the main experimental results of
Salganik et al. (Science, 311, pp. 854-856 (2006)); we show in particular that the value of the social
inﬂuence parameter can be estimated from the data. In one of the experimental situation, this value
is found to be close to the critical value of the model.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Making decisions is part of everyday life. Some situations require a binary choice (i.e.

to vote yes or no in a
referendum, to buy or not to buy a cell phone, to join or not to join a riot, etc. [1, 2]). Many others involve multiple
options, for example in the ﬁrst round of French presidential elections (where the number of candidates is typically 15),
in portfolio management where very many stocks are eligible, in supermarkets where the number of possible products
to buy is large, etc. In most cases, the choice is constrained by some generalized budget constraint, either strictly
(at most one candidate in the French presidential election) or softly (the total spending in a supermarket should on
average be smaller than some amount). It is common experience that people generally do not determine their action
in isolation. Quite on the contrary, interactions and herding eﬀects often strongly distort individual preferences, and
are clearly responsible for the appearance of trends, fashions and bubbles that would be diﬃcult to understand if
agents were insensitive to the behaviour of their peers. Catastrophic events (such as crashes, or sudden opinion shifts)
can occur at the macro level, induced by imitation, whereas the aggregate behaviour of independent agents would be
perfectly smooth.

A relevant challenge in the present era of information economy is to be able to extract faithfully individual opin-
ions/tastes from the publicly expressed preferences under the inﬂuence of the crowd. For example, book reviewers
on Amazon may be biased by the opinion expressed by previous reviews; if imitation eﬀects are too strong, over-
whelmingly positive (or negative) reviews cannot be trusted (see [3]), as a result of “information cascades” [4]. In
the case of ﬁnancial markets, strong herding eﬀects in the earning forecasts of ﬁnancial analysts have been reported
– the dispersion of these forecasts is typically ten time smaller than the ex post diﬀerence between the forecast and
the actual earning (see [5] and refs. therein). These herding eﬀects may lead to a complete divergence between the
market price and any putative ‘rational’ price. In the context of scientiﬁc publications, the substitution of the present
refereeing process by other assessment tools, such as number of downloads from a preprint web-page, or number of
citations, is also prone to strong, winner-takes-all, distortions [6, 7]. More generally, it is plausible that such herding
phenomena play a role in the appearance of Pareto-tails in the measure of success (wealth, income, book sales, movie
attendance, etc.).

Despite their importance, already stressed long-ago by Keynes and more recently by Schelling [1], quantitative
models of herding and interaction eﬀects have only been explored, in diﬀerent contexts, in a recent past, see [2, 4, 8,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. This category of models have in fact a long history in physics, where interaction is indeed
at the root of genuinely collective eﬀects in condensed matter, such as ferromagnetism, superconductivity, etc. One
particular model, that appears to be particularly interesting and generic, is the so-called ‘Random Field Ising Model’
(rfim) [16], which models the dynamics of magnets under the inﬂuence of a slowly evolving external solicitation. This
model can be transposed in a socio-economics context [9, 17, 18, 19] to represent a binary decision situation under
social pressure. A robust feature of the model is that discontinuities appear in aggregate quantities when imitation
eﬀects exceed a certain threshold, even if the external solicitation varies smoothly with time. Below this threshold, the
behaviour of demand, or of the average opinion, is smooth, but the natural trends can be substantially ampliﬁed by

peer pressure. The predictions of the rfim can be confronted, with some success, to empirical observations concerning
sales of cell phones, birth rates and the terminal phase of clapping in concert halls [19].

Here, we want to generalize the rfim to multiple choice situations. One motivation is that, as mentioned above,
these situations are extremely common. A more precise incentive for such a generalization is however the recent
publication of a remarkable experimental paper by Salganik, Dodds and Watts [20]. In order to detect and quantify
social inﬂuence eﬀects, the authors have conducted a careful Web-based experiment (described below) with several
quantitative results. Their detailed interpretation begs for a speciﬁc model, which we introduce and discuss in this
paper and compare with these empirical results. The model is found to fare quite well and allows one to extract
from the data a quantitative estimate of the imitation strength, called J below. Interestingly, one of the situations
corresponds to a value of J close to the critical point of the model, where collective eﬀects become dominant and
strongly distort individual preferences.

We consider N agents indexed by roman labels i = 1, ..., N , and M items indexed by Greek labels α = 1, ..., M .
Each agent can construct his ‘shopping list’ or portfolio of items, for simplicity, we restrict here to cases where the
quantity of item α is either zero or unity (in the example of movies, we neglect the possibility of going twice to see the
same movie). The portfolio of agent i is therefore a vector of size M : {nα
i = 0, 1. The “budget constraint”
can in general be written as:

i } with nα

where the budget might be diﬀerent for diﬀerent agents.

The choices made by agent i are assumed to be determined by three diﬀerent factors:

• a piece of public information aﬀecting all agents equally, measuring the intrinsic attractivity of item α. This is
modeled by a real variable F α, which may contain, for example, the price of the product (low price means large
F α’s), or its technological performances, past reputation, etc.

• an idiosyncratic part describing the preferences/tastes of agent i, in the absence of any social pressure or
i , which is positive and large if agent i is

imitation eﬀects. This part is again modeled by a real variable hα
particularly fond of item α.

• a social pressure/imitation term which describes how the choices made by others aﬀect the perception of item

α by agent i. In full generality, we can write this term as:

j,i measures the inﬂuence of the consumption of product β by agent j. Positive J β,α

where J β,α
j,i ’s describe herding-
like eﬀects (which could exist across diﬀerent products), whereas negative J β,α
j,i ’s are related to contrarian eﬀects
(for example, agent j buying item β might push the price of item α up). We will consider in this paper a
simpliﬁed version of the model where only the aggregate consumption of item α itself inﬂuences the value of nα
i ,
i.e.:

where the factor M is introduced for convenience and C is the total consumption, deﬁned as:

We will also introduce the total consumption of item α as Cα =
φα = Cα/C, with

α φα = 1.

P

i , and the relative consumption (or success rate)

We assume that the consumption of item α by agent i is eﬀective if the sum of these three determining factors

exceed a certain threshold, and consider the following update rule for the nα

where Θ is the Heaviside function, Θ(u > 0) = 1 and Θ(u ≤ 0) = 0. In the above equation, we have added a ‘chemical
potential’ bi (borrowing from the statistical physics jargon) which allows the budget constraint to be satisﬁed at all
times [21]. The −1/M term was added for convenience, and makes explicit that it is the consumption of item α in
comparison with its expected average 1/M that generates a signal (see also [22]). It is easy to check that the case
M = 1, with J → JC/N , corresponds to the standard rfim considered in [19]. Note also that the Θ function describes
a deterministic situation: as soon as the total ‘utility’ of item α is positive for agent i, consumption is eﬀective. One
could choose a probabilistic situation where Θ(u) is replaced by a smoothed step function, for example:

Θβ(u) =

1
1 + e−βu .

The limit β → ∞ corresponds to the deterministic rule, to which we will restrict throughout this paper.

In the following, we assume that both F ’s and h’s are time independent, and taken from some statistical distributions
which we have to specify. Here again, the number of possibilities is very large, and correspond to diﬀerent situations.
We choose the F α’s as iid random variables (for example Gaussian), with mean mF and variance Σ2
F . The mean mF
describes the average intrinsic attractivity of items – for example, a large overall inﬂation would lead to a negative
mF . The dispersion in quality of the diﬀerent items is captured by ΣF . More realistic models should include some
sort of ‘sectorial’ correlations between the F α’s.

As for hα

i ’s, we posit that they can be decomposed as hα

i , where hi describes the propensity of agent i
for consumption (‘compulsive buyers’ correspond to large positive hi’s), whereas δhα
i correspond to the idiosyncratic
i are iid; without
tastes of agent i, deﬁned to have zero mean. For simplicity, we again assume that both hi’s and δhα
loss of generality we can assume that the average (over i) of hi is zero (a non zero value could be reabsorbed into mF ).
The variance of hi is Σ2 and that of δhα
i is σ2. Since in the limit β → ∞ considered in this paper the overall scale of the
ﬁelds is irrelevant, we can choose to set σ ≡ 1. One could also add explicit time dependence, for example choosing mF
to be an increasing function of time, to describe a situation where the average propensity for consumption increases
with time.

i = hi + δhα

The model as deﬁned above is extremely rich and its detailed investigation as a function of the diﬀerent parameters
and budget constraints will be reported in a forthcoming publication. The most interesting question about such a
model is to know whether the realized consumption is faithful, i.e. whether or not the actual choice of the diﬀerent items
reﬂects the ‘true’ preferences of individual agents, as would be the case in the absence of interactions (J = 0). Based
on the rfim, we expect that this will not be the case when J is suﬃciently large, in which case strong distortions
will occur, meaning that the realized consumption will (i) violate the natural ordering of individual preferences
and (ii) become history dependent: a particular initial condition determines the ‘winners’ in an irreproducible and

measured diﬀerent observables, in particular:

• The Gini coeﬃcient G, deﬁned as:

which is zero if all items are equally chosen, and equal to 1 − 1/M if a unique item is chosen. The Gini coeﬃcient
is a classic measure of inequality. In fact, a more relevant measure of interaction eﬀects is the ratio G/G0, where
G0 is the Gini coeﬃcient for J = 0.

• The unpredictability coeﬃcient U , deﬁned as:

where the indices k, ℓ refer to W diﬀerent ‘worlds’, i.e. diﬀerent realizations of the model with the very same
F α’s but a diﬀerent set hα
i ’s (chosen with the same distribution) or diﬀerent initial conditions. In the limit of a
large population (N → ∞), it is easy to show that U = 0 when J = 0, since the φα only depends on the F α’s.
A non zero value of U , on the other hand, reveals that it impossible to infer from the intrinsic quality of the
items the aggregate consumption proﬁle (strong distortion).

• A more detailed information is provided by the scatter plot of φα versus φα(J = 0); for J small one expects
a nearly linear relation, whereas for larger J the points acquire a larger dispersion and the average relation
becomes non-linear, indicating a substantial ‘exaggeration’ of the consumption of slightly better items.

We have studied these quantities both numerically and analytically within the above model. We present below
some of our numerical results, and compare them with the empirical results of [20]. Our most important analytical
result is the existence of a critical value Jc, below which the unpredictability U is strictly zero in the limit N → ∞,
and becomes positive for J > Jc, growing as U ∼ J − Jc close to the transition. The ﬂuctuations of U diverge close
to Jc, as for standard second order phase transitions. The value of Jc can be computed exactly in the limit of a large
number of items M ≫ 1, and depends on the detailed shape of the distribution of the ﬁelds F and h. More precisely,
Jc is given by:

III. THE WEB-BASED EXPERIMENT OF SALGANIK ET AL.

Here we describe the beautiful experimental set-up of M. J. Salganik, P. S. Dodds and D. J. Watts [20], which
allows them to conclude that social inﬂuence has a determinant eﬀect on the choices of individual agents. In the next
section, we will in fact use their quantitative results to measure, within the above theoretical framework, the strength
of the social inﬂuence factor J. Salganik et al. have [20] created an artiﬁcial “music market” on the web with M = 48
songs from essentially unknown bands in which 14,341 (mostly teen-agers) participated. Songs are presented in a
screen and participants make decisions about which songs to listen to, and in a second step, whether they want to
download the song they listened to. Participants are randomly assigned to one of the three following situations:

• an independent (zero-inﬂuence) situation where the list of songs carries no mention of the songs downloaded by
other participants. This situation allows to deﬁne a benchmark, where an ‘intrinsic’ mix between the quality of
the songs and the preference of the participants can be measured. This situation corresponds to J = 0 in the
model above;

• a ‘weak’ social inﬂuence situation. In this case, the number of times a given song has been downloaded by other
participants is shown. However, the songs are presented in random order so that the ranking of the preference
of other participants is not obvious at ﬁrst glance. This situation corresponds to a certain small value J1 > 0 in
the model above;

• a ‘strong’ social inﬂuence situation. In this case, the list of songs is presented by decreasing number of downloads,
such as to emphasize the preferences expressed by previous participants. This situation corresponds to a certain
value J2 > J1 > 0 in the model above.

Furthermore, in both social inﬂuence conditions participants are randomly assigned to W = 8 diﬀerent worlds, each
one with its own history and evolving independently from one another, but with the same initial conditions, i.e. zero
downloads. For each of the two inﬂuence conditions, the outcomes (i.e. the number of downloads of all songs) are
compared to the independent, zero-inﬂuence situation. In this way, the authors are able to conclude that increasing
the strength of social inﬂuence increases both the inequality G and the unpredictability of success U [20].

Because these experiments look very much like those in physical laboratories, we believe that they could play
an important role in the development of scientiﬁc investigations of collective human behavior. The Web gives the
opportunity to devise and perform large scale experimentation (see also [23]), with a number of participants that
allows one to extract meaningful statistical information, We expect that many other experiments of the same type
will be conducted in the future. In the present case, the experiment is very carefully thought through to remove
many artefacts: for example, download is free (no consideration of the wealth of participants is required – no ‘budget
constraint’) and anonymous (no direct social pressure is involved); participants are not rewarded to have made a
‘good’ or ‘useful’ choice, songs and bands are not well known (avoiding strong a priori biases), etc.

IV. MODEL CALIBRATION: TOWARDS A MEASUREMENT OF SOCIAL INFLUENCE?

We now turn to a semi-quantitative analysis of the empirical data collected by Salganik et al.

(dashed vertical line), and to grow linearly for small J − Jc > 0. The empirical values of U for N = 700 and in the three
diﬀerent situations are: U0 ≈ 0.0045 (no imitation), U1 ≈ 0.008 (weak imitation) and G2 ≈ 0.013 (strong imitation). This last

parameters: mF , ΣF , Σ and the social inﬂuence J. These values must be chosen as to reproduce the observations
reported in [20], namely:

• The Gini coeﬃcient G0, the unpredictability U0 and the qualitative shape of the distribution of φα

0 in the

independent situation, corresponding to J = 0.

• The Gini coeﬃcient G, the unpredictability U and the qualitative shape of the relation between φα and φα

0 in

the social inﬂuence conditions

Quite a lot more data is reported in the supplementary material of [20], for example the average number of
downloaded songs per participant d = C/N . In fact, the situation of [20] is slightly more complicated than assumed
in the above model because each participant makes a two-step decision. Participants, before possibly downloading a
song, ﬁrst choose to listen to it. These two decisions may be correlated and both inﬂuenced by the choice of other
participants. The authors of [20] report separate statistics for the number of downloaded songs and the number of
‘tested’ songs. In order to reproduce these results in full detail, one must generalize the above model, for example by
assuming that the number of downloads of song α by agent i can be written as:

where Ψα
i = 1 with probability pα and 0 otherwise describing the decision of actually downloading a song after
listening to it. Although the inclusion of this second decision step is crucial to account fully for the results of [20],
we neglect this aspect altogether in the present paper and refer the reader to a later, more detailed publication [21].
Here we want to show that the main empirical features can indeed be reproduced by the model.

Diﬀerent choices of mF , ΣF , Σ are in fact compatible with the observations corresponding to J = 0, for which
Salganik et al. ﬁnd G0 ≈ 0.22 and U0 ≈ 0.0045 (for a number of participants in each ‘world’ of N = 700, the value
we also use in our numerical simulations). A possible choice (further justiﬁed in [21]) is: mF ≈ −2, ΣF ≈ 0.2,
Σ = 1. The resulting shape of the distribution of φα
0 is found to be compatible with the data of [20]. Note that
Σ2
F = 0.04 < Σ2 + σ2 = 2, suggesting that the intrinsic quality of songs is less dispersed than the preference of agents.
This is expected in a situation where songs and bands are unknown, leading to very small a priori information on
their intrinsic quality.

Now, it is interesting to see how G and U are aﬀected by a non zero value of J – cf. Figs. 1 and 2. ¿From these
plots, one sees that the ‘weak’ social inﬂuence situation, characterized by G1 ≈ 0.35 and U1 ≈ 0.008 [20], corresponds
to J1 ≈ 0.17. One the other hand, the ‘strong’ inﬂuence situation yields G2 ≈ 0.5 and U2 ≈ 0.013 [20], which we
can account for by setting J2 ≈ 0.30. The scatter plots of φα vs. φα
0 are shown in Figs 3-a and 3-b and can be
satisfactorily compared to Figs. 3-A and 3-C of [20].

It is of particular interest to compare the above values of J1 and J2 to the critical value Jc of the model, which can
be determined exactly as a function of mF , ΣF , Σ in the limit M → ∞ [21]. In the present case, we ﬁnd Jc ≈ 0.29,
such that, in the limit N → ∞, U (J < Jc) should be strictly zero. As expected on general grounds and shown in
Fig. 2, the value of U at ﬁnite N suﬀers from large ﬁnite size eﬀects. Only a careful extrapolation for N → ∞ allows
one to conﬁrm the existence of a critical value Jc [21]. But in any case, the value J2 accounting for the data in the
‘strong’ inﬂuence situation is indeed quite large, since it corresponds to the critical region where imitation eﬀects
become dominant.

Another eﬀect worth noticing is the dependence of the average number of downloaded songs d (or consumption
C = N d) on the imitation parameter J, predicted by the model and reported in Fig 4. We see that this quantity has
a clear maximum as a function of J: at ﬁrst, imitation eﬀects tend to increase the total consumption until J ∼ 1,
beyond which over-polarisation on a small number of items become such that the total consumption goes back down.
This might have interesting consequences for marketing policies, for example (see e.g. [24, 25]). The increase of the
d with J is actually not observed in [20]; see [21] for a further discussion of this point.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have proposed a generic model for multiple choice situations with imitation eﬀects and compared it with recent
empirical results from a Web-based cultural market experiment. Our model predicts to a phase transition between a
weak imitation phase, in which expressed individual preferences are close to their value in the absence of any direct
social pressure, and a strong imitation, ‘fashion’ phase, where choices are driven by peer pressure and the ranking of
individual preferences is strongly distorted at the aggregate level. The model can be calibrated to reproduce the main
experimental results of Salganik et al. [20]; we show in particular that the value of the social inﬂuence parameter can
be estimated from the data. In one of the experimental situation, this value is found to be close to the critical value

of the model, conﬁrming quantitatively that social pressure are strong in that case. This concurs with the conclusions
of [19], who also found near critical values of the social inﬂuence parameter.

Our model can be transposed to many interesting situations, for example that of industrial production, for which
one expects a transition between an archaic economy dominated by very few products and a fully diversiﬁed economy
as the dispersion of individual needs becomes larger. We leave the investigation of these questions, and the detailed
analytical investigation of our model, for a further publication. We believe that the simultaneous development of
theoretical models and detailed, rigorous experiments in the vein of [20] or [23, 26], will help promoting a quantitative
understanding of collective human (and animal) behaviour.

With the advancement in the information age, people are using electronic media more frequently
for communications, and social relationships are also increasingly resorting to online channels. While
extensive studies on traditional social networks have been carried out, little has been done on
online social network. Here we analyze the structure and evolution of online social relationships by
examining the temporal records of a bulletin board system (BBS) in a university. The BBS dataset
comprises of 1,908 boards, in which a total of 7,446 students participate. An edge is assigned to
each dialogue between two students, and it is deﬁned as the appearance of the name of a student in
the from- and to-ﬁeld in each message. This yields a weighted network between the communicating
students with an unambiguous group association of individuals. In contrast to a typical community
network, where intracommunities (intercommunities) are strongly (weakly) tied, the BBS network
contains hub members who participate in many boards simultaneously but are strongly tied, that is,
they have a large degree and betweenness centrality and provide communication channels between
communities. On the other hand, intracommunities are rather homogeneously and weakly connected.
Such a structure, which has never been empirically characterized in the past, might provide a new
perspective on social opinion formation in this digital era.

INTRODUCTION

With the advancement in the information age, people
are using electronic media for communication more fre-
quently, and social relationships between people are also
increasingly resorting to online communications. For ex-
ample, the advent of online bulletin board systems (BBS)
made it possible to develop a new type of online social
relationship and social consensus. Very similar to the
Usenet service, which was fairly popular during the ear-
lier days of the Internet, BBS is based on the commu-
nication between people sharing common interests; the
topic of interest is usually identiﬁed by the board itself.
People with common interests post messages on a cer-
tain board and a response is conveyed by posting an-
other message, thereby forming a thread. Thus, a thread
in the BBS roughly represents a dialogue between peo-
ple, and such a dialogue constitutes the basic relationship
among the people participating in it. In the BBS, dia-
logues or discussions usually proceed with little restric-
tion on message writing and discrimination based on per-
sonal information, thereby forming the so-called “warm
discussions” as described in psycho-sociology [1]. There-
fore, the pattern of such online social relationships may
be diﬀerent from that of traditional social relationships
based on face-to-face contact or online communication
involving exchange of personal information, such as e-
mail transactions [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and instant messaging [7].
Thus, it would be interesting to study the structure of
online social relationship networks constructed by people
in warm discussions; this would be useful in resolving di-
verse sociological and political issues and understanding

the manner in which social opinion is formed in the digi-
tal era [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Extensive studies on traditional
social networks have been carried out [13, 14, 15]; how-
ever, few studies exist on online social networks. Here,
we investigate the structure of online social networks by
studying BBS networks, which are familiar to university
students.

From the graph theoretical perspective, the BBS net-
work oﬀers distinct features such as weighted and modu-
lar network structure. Since the number of times a given
pair of people exchange dialogues can be counted explic-
itly, a weighted network is naturally obtained [16]. More-
over, since people are sharing a board corresponding to
their common interests, BBS provides an unambiguous
way of deﬁning modules or communities [17]. This is
unlike other examples of accessible protocols, including
the sibling/peer relationship in the online community [18]
and trackback in the blog system [19]. In fact, the BBS
network constructed by us diﬀers in crucial aspects from
other aﬃliation networks such as the collaboration net-
work [20] and student course registration network [21]. In
these examples, the relationship between people is not ex-
plicitly deﬁned but is indicated indirectly by their aﬃlia-
tion. Such an indirect deﬁnition generates several cliques-
completely connected subgroups-which may result in an
artifact particularly in the case of large-sized aﬃliations.
Thus, to obtain a network of people with explicit pairwise
interaction strength together with a distinct community
deﬁnition is crucial for an appropriate description of the
social system. The BBS network provides such ingredi-
ents.

and traditional social network (b).

II. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

The BBS network has interesting structural features
and implications. It contains hub members who partici-
pate in dialogues across a large number of boards, thereby
connecting one group of people at one board to another
group at a diﬀerent board. Further, their degrees, which
are the numbers of people they have exchanged dialogues
with, are large, thereby inﬂuencing other people through-
out diﬀerent communities. As a result, the hub mem-
bers act as weak ties in connecting diﬀerent communi-
ties; however, their links are strong during on actual ac-
tivity. On the other hand, intraboard connections are
rather homogeneous in degree. Such a network feature is
in contrast to traditional social networks maintained by
the ties bridging disparate communities, which tend to
be weak [14]. The diﬀerence is schematically depicted in
Fig. 1. In the BBS network, the strength s, i.e., the total
number of dialogues each individual participates in has a
nonlinear relationship with the degree k as s ∼ k1.4. This
implies that the hub members tend to post messages at
considerably more frequently than the other people with
small degrees. The neutrality in the assortative mixing
is another feature of the BBS network compared with
the assortativity in traditional social networks. Such a
behavior may originate due to the absence of personal
information on the partner during online social commu-
nication. Thus, hub members are democratic in their
connections to the remaining people, and they are in-
deed “ubiquitous persons.” Since the hub members play
a dominant role in providing communication channels
across diﬀerent boards, it might be more eﬃcient to use a
BBS-like online media for persuading people and drawing
social consensus than traditional social networks based
on person-to-person relationships. We attempt to under-
stand the BBS network from the perspective of a simple
network model. In the model, we take into account the
empirical fact that the BBS network contains groups of
which size are inhomogeneous. In addition, the link den-
sity of each group is not uniform, however decreases with
increasing group size, which has been usually neglected
in constructing model.

It would be interesting to implement the present work
in the context of a previous study involving a psycho-
sociological experiment on group discussions and the re-
sulting consensus [1], in which, group discussions are dis-

2

tinguished into two types, “warm” and “cold”.
In the
former type, people express their thoughts freely without
any restriction, while in the latter, group discussions are
restricted by some constraint either explicitly or implic-
itly, for example, the hierarchy in group members. The
experimental study concludes that the consensus mea-
sured after group discussions can be diﬀerent from that
before the discussions depending on the type. In the for-
mer, the consensus after discussions shifts to an extreme
opinions, while in the latter, it leads to a trade-oﬀ aver-
age group consensus. From the perspective of the exper-
iment, we might state that the dialogues in the BBS are
warm because no restriction is imposed on posting mes-
sages and little information on the personal background
of the partner is provided. Thus, the dialogues in the
BBS may lead to radicalized consensus, violent group be-
haviors, or imaginative and creative solutions to a given
issue. Since students still in the process of developing a
value system are vulnerable to negative inﬂuences, and
have more opportunities to be inﬂuenced by their peers
through online networks in this digital era than in the
past, the proposed network pattern we report here will be
useful in guiding them in the right direction. Moreover,
the BBS network data will be helpful in understanding
the manner in which diverse opinions are synchronized
from the psycho-sociological perspective.

III. BBS NETWORK

We mainly examined the BBS system at the Korea Ad-
vanced Institute of Science and Technology; it is named
as loco.kaist.ac.kr. The characteristics of the net-
work structure obtained from this BBS system also ap-
pear in another system-bar.kaist.ac.kr. The data
comprises records of all the threads posted from March
9, 2000 to November 2, 2004, thus corresponding to a du-
ration of around three and a half years. As of November
2004, the system comprised 1,908 boards with a total of
7,446 participating students. In order to ensure privacy,
we are only allowed to access the information on “from,”
“to,” the date of posting, and the name of the board it
was posted on, for each message. Based on this informa-
tion, we constructed the network between students such
that for each message, an edge was assigned between two
students appearing as “from” and “to.” Alternatively, an
arc (a directed edge) can be assigned for each message;
however, we found that the communications are largely
reciprocal: Approximately a half of the postings are ac-
companied by another one with its from and to ﬁelds
reversed, for example, a “Re:” message. Subsequently,
we shall consider the network as undirected for simplicity.
Our network construction naturally yields a weighted
network in which the weight wij of the edge between two
students i and j is determined by the number of messages
they exchanged during the period. The detailed statistics
of the BBS are listed in Table I.

A. Student network

The global snapshot of the student network in Fig. 1
reveals the inhomogeneity among the students. The de-
gree ki of a student i, which is the number of students
he/she has exchanged dialogues with, is distributed ac-
cording to a power law with an exponent of around −1
followed by an exponential cutoﬀ, as shown in Fig. 2(a).
This feature is similar to that of the scientiﬁc collabora-
tion network [20]. The strength si of a student i is the
sum of the weight of each edge attached to i. Therefore,
si = PN
j aijwij , where aij is the component of the adja-
cent matrix; its value is 1 if an edge is connected between
vertices i and j and 0 otherwise. wij is the weight of the
edge between i and j. The strength and degree of a stu-
dent exhibit a scaling behavior s(k) ∼ kβ with β ≈ 1.4;
however, the ﬂuctuation is quite strong, particularly for
a small k [Fig. 2(b)]. The strength distribution exhibits
a behavior that is similar to that of the degree distribu-
tion; however, the value of the cutoﬀ is larger[Fig. 2(a)].
The nonlinear relationship between s and k implies that
the hub members tend to post messages at considerably
more frequently than the other people, as is evident in
Table II.

Other standard measures of network topology are also
obtained. The local clustering coeﬃcient ci is the local
density of transitive relationships, deﬁned as the number
of triangles formed by its neighbors, cornered by itself,
i, divided by the maximum possible number of these,
ki(ki − 1)/2. The average of ci over vertices with a given
degree k is referred to as the clustering function C(k).
For the student network, C(k) decays as ∼ k−0.5 for large
k, and its weighted version deﬁned in Ref. [16]1 behaves
as C(w)(k) ∼ k−0.3, as shown in Fig. 2(c). The clustering
coeﬃcient C, which is the average of ci over all vertices
with k > 1, is ≈ 0.48. This is one order of magnitude
greater than Crandom ≈ 0.04 of its typical randomized
counterpart with an identical degree sequence [22]. The
average nearest-neighbor degree function knn(k), which
is deﬁned by the average degree of the neighbors of ver-
tices of degree k, is almost ﬂat for the student network;
nevertheless, its weighted version deﬁned in [16] shows a
slightly upward curvature for large k (Fig. 2(d)). The as-
sortativity coeﬃcient [23] for the binary network and the
Spearman rank correlation of the degrees are measured
to be close to zero, as r ≈ 0.011 and rSpearman ≈ 0.024,
respectively. This almost neutral mixing, which is in con-

1 In Ref. [16], the local weighted clustering coeﬃcient was deﬁned
as c(w)
i = Pj,h(wij + wih)aij aihajh/[2si(ki − 1)]. C(w)(k) is
the average of c(w)
over vertices with degree k. The weighted
average nearest-neighbors degree of vertex i was deﬁned as
k(w)
nn,i = PN
nn,i over
the vertices with degree k.

trast to the common belief that social networks are as-
sortative, has also been observed in another online social
network [18].

The number of boards that a student participates in
is likely to be larger for students with a larger degree, as
shown in Fig. 2(e). Its distribution follows a skewed func-
tional form in Fig. 2(f). These results imply an important
fact that a group of people with a large degree tend to
participate in diverse dialogues on diﬀerent boards and
will play a dominant role in drawing social consensus on
diverse issues. Moreover, they work as mediators between
diﬀerent groups in an online social community.

The betweenness centrality (BC) or load [24, 25, 26],
which is deﬁned as the eﬀective number of paths or pack-
ets passing through a given vertex when every pair of
vertices gives and receives information, is also measured.
The BC distribution follows a power law with an expo-
nent ≈ 2.2, as shown in Fig. 3(a) and the BC of a given
vertex ℓ is strongly correlated to its degree k as ℓ ∼ k1.6
as shown in Fig. 3(b). This implies that the hub mem-

bers have a large BC and have a strong inﬂuence on the
remaining people.

In other words, the student network is extremely het-
erogeneous, highly clustered, and yet, almost neutrally
mixed, thereby exhibiting a strong nonlinear relationship
between the strength and degree.

B. Board network

The procedure for constructing the board network is
similar to the usual projection method of the bipartite af-
ﬁliation network. We create a link between two boards if
they share at least one common member. In other words,
each student participating in more than one board con-
tributes a complete subgraph—a clique— to the board
network. Thus, the board network is the superposition
of cliques, each of which originates from the crossboard
activities of a student. Such crossboard activities will
provide channels for information transmission across the
boards. In order to assign meaningful weights to these
channels, all the links in each clique are assigned a weight
that is equal to the inverse of the number of vertices in
that clique.
In other words, the communication chan-
nels created by the students posting on fewer boards are
stronger. Therefore, the weight of an edge between two
boards increases with the number of co-members; how-
ever, the contributions of “ubiquitous persons” would
only be moderate. The strength of a board is the sum
of the weights of its edges. Such a strength distribution
along with the degree distribution, which does not ac-
count for the weight, is shown in Fig. 4(a). The relation
between the strength and degree is shown in Fig. 4(b).

The board network is quite highly clustered with a
clustering coeﬃcient of ≈ 0.61, and the clustering func-
tion decreases with k [Fig. 4(c)]. However, it is notewor-
thy that such a high clustering may result from the gen-
eration of cliques by the projection procedure. Moreover,
even the randomized board network has a clustering co-
eﬃcient as high as ≈ 0.48. The average nearest-neighbor
degree initially increases with k but decreases for larger
k. However, its weighted version increases monotonically
with k, as shown in Fig. 4(d).

V. STUDENT NETWORK WITHIN A BOARD

Upon examining the networks within a board, we
were presented with a diﬀerent scenario. As shown in
Fig. 5(a), the degree distributions of the student net-
works within the boards are rather homogeneous. They
exhibit a peak followed by an exponential tail, which
overall ﬁts well into the Gamma distribution. Here, the
degree k must be speciﬁed in further detail. Consider a
case where two students A and B on a given board who
do not communicate directly with each other. However,
this communication between A and B can occur on a dif-
ferent board. In this case, the two students are regarded
to be connected for the deﬁnition of degree in Fig. 5(a).
When such a pair is regarded to be disconnected, the de-
gree k0 is redeﬁned and its distribution exhibits fat tails,
as shown in Fig. 5(b); this was also observed in another
BBS system.

The size of the board, which denotes the number of
students posting messages on it, has a broad distribution
[Fig. 5(c)]- a power law followed by a rapidly decaying
tail. The edge density Λ inside a given board scales with
its size M as Λ(M ) ∼ M −0.65, as shown in Fig. 5(d).
Such a behavior cannot be observed in the random sam-
pling of populations of diﬀerent sizes, thereby indicat-
ing that the communications between students are in-
deed strongly constrained within each board rather than
across them. Further, the power-law scaling behavior
suggests that the BBS network is organized in a self-
similar manner. From this result, it is evident that the

usual projection method involving the creation of cliques
by bipartite aﬃliation graphs cannot provide an appro-
priate description of the BBS system. Moreover, such a
size-dependent scaling of edge density within groups has
not been realized thus far in a simple model of a clustered
network [28].

VI. EVOLUTION OF THE BBS NETWORK

The daily record of the BBS network also allows us
to examine the temporal evolution of the network. The
number of vertices (students) N grows exponentially af-
ter the transient period; however, the continuously mod-
erated growth rate appears to attain a steady state
[Fig. 6(a)]. Similar behavior is observed in the case of
the number of links L and the number of dialogues W .
The number of boards G grows at a rather steady rate
over the period.

Despite its continuous evolution, the structural prop-
erties of the network seem to be in a stationary state.
In other words, the overall network characteristics such
as the degree distribution and clustering function achieve
their forms in the initial period (after ∼1 year), and do
not change considerably with time, as shown in Figs. 6(c)
and (d). The crossover time scale of approximately 1
year can also be observed in terms of the evolution of
the number of vertices N : Their growth patterns change
qualitatively after ∼10 months, as seen in Figs. 6(a) and
(b).

VII. SIMPLE MODEL

Having identiﬁed the main statistical characteristics of
the BBS network, we attempt to understand them from
the perspective of a simple network model. First, we
consider a simple extension of the model of a clustered
network introduced by Newman [28]. The original model
of Newman is speciﬁed with two fundamental probability
distributions, rm and sM . rm represents the probability
that an individual belongs to m groups [PB(B) in our
notation; (see Fig. 5(d))] and sM , the probability that
the group size is M [PM (M ) in our notation]. By assum-
ing that the link density within the groups is given by a
constant parameter p, it is possible to obtain several of
formulae for the network structure using the generating
function method. For example, the degree distribution
of the network can be written as follows:

Pd(k) =

1
k!

dk
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
dzk f0[g1(pz + q)]
(cid:12)
(cid:12)z=0

,

(1)

where f0(z) and g1(z) are appropriate generating func-
tions deﬁned as f0(z) = P∞
m=0 rmzm and g1(z) =
hM i−1 P∞

M=0 M sM zM−1, and q = 1 − p.

However an obvious shortcoming of the model is that
in real data, the link densities are not uniform across
the boards and they strongly depend on the board size,

as shown in Fig. 5(d). In fact, by simply applying this
model with the average link density p ≈ 0.3 along with
rm and sM , directly measured from the data, the de-
gree distribution of the BBS network cannot be repro-
duced. Therefore, we modify the model by allowing p
to vary across the group, based on the empirical formula
Λ(M ) ∼ M −0.65. Such a modiﬁcation complicates the
mathematical formulae and they must be solved numer-
ically. The resulting degree distribution of the modiﬁed
model along with that of the real data is shown in Fig. 7.
Although it is imperfect, the agreement improved signif-
icantly. Thus, it is crucial to incorporate the nonuniform
link density into the realistic modeling of the BBS net-
work.

The manner in which the group size distribution,
group membership distribution, and group density
scaling, which are the input parameters of the model,
achieve their present forms, as shown in Figs. 5(c) and
(d), is a topic for future study.

Abstract

We argue that on electronic markets, limit and market orders should
have equal eﬀective costs on average. This symmetry implies a linear rela-
tion between the bid-ask spread and the average impact of market orders.
Our empirical observations on diﬀerent markets are consistent with this
hypothesis. We then use this relation to justify a simple, and hitherto
unnoticed, proportionality relation between the spread and the volatility
per trade. We provide convincing empirical evidence for this relation. This
suggests that the main determinant of the bid-ask spread is adverse se-
lection, if one considers that the volatility per trade is a measure of the
amount of ‘information’ included in prices at each transaction. Symmetry
between market and limit orders stems from the self-organization of liq-
uidity in electronic markets. Our results appear to hold approximately on
liquid specialist markets as well, although the spread is signiﬁcantly larger.

1 Introduction

One of the most important attribute of ﬁnancial markets is to provide liquidity
to investors [1], who may convert cash into stocks and vice-versa nearly instanta-
neously whenever they choose to do so. Of course, some markets are more liquid
than others and the liquidity of a given market varies in time and can in fact
dramatically dry up in crisis situations. How should markets be organized, at
the micro-structural level, to optimize liquidity, and to favor steady and orderly

1

trading by avoiding these liquidity crises? In the past, the burden of providing
liquidity was given to market makers, or specialists. In order to ensure steady
trading, the specialists alternatively sell to buyers and buy to sellers, and re-
tribute themselves through the so-called bid-ask spread – i.e. the price at which
they sell to the crowd is always slightly larger than the price at which they buy.
The determinants of the value of the spread in specialists markets have been the
subject of many studies in the economics literature [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. How-
ever, most ﬁnancial markets have nowadays become electronic (with the notable
exception of the New-York Stock Exchange, nyse). In these markets, liquidity is
self-organized, in the sense that all agents can choose to be liquidity consumers
or liquidity providers. More precisely, any agent can provide liquidity by posting
limit orders: these are propositions to sell (or buy) a certain volume of shares
or lots at a minimum (maximum) price ﬁxed by the emitter. Limit orders are
stored in the order-book. At a given instant in time, the best oﬀer on the sell side
(the ‘ask’) is higher than the best price on the buy side (the ‘bid’) and no trans-
action takes place. For a transaction to occur, an agent must consume liquidity
by launching a market order to buy or to sell a certain number of shares; the
transaction occurs at the best available price, provided the volume in the order
book at that price is enough to absorb the incoming market order. Otherwise,
the price ‘walks up’ (or down) the ladder of oﬀers in the order book, until the
order is fully satisﬁed. The liquidity of the market is partially characterized by
the bid-ask spread S, which sets the cost of an instantaneous round-trip of one
share (a buy instantaneously followed by a sell).1 A liquid market is such that
this cost is small. A question of both theoretical and practical crucial importance
is to know what ﬁxes the magnitude of the spread in the self-organized set-up of
electronic markets.

In large fraction of the economics literature [2, 3, 4, 5], liquidity providers are
described as market makers who earn proﬁt from the spread. In a competitive
framework the spread should be determined by requiring that such a strategy
has zero gain on average. The resulting spread is non zero because this strategy
has costs. Three types of cost are discussed in the literature: (i) order process-
ing costs; (ii) adverse selection costs: sometimes, liquidity takers have superior
information on the future price of the stock, in which case the market maker
loses money;2 (iii) inventory risk: market makers may temporarily accumulate
large long or short positions which are risky. If agents are risk-sensitive this adds
extra-costs. Theoretical models that account for these costs typically introduce
a rather large amount of free parameters (such as risk-aversion to risk, fraction
of informed trades, fraction of patient/ impatient traders, etc.) which cannot be
measured directly. In order to extract the diﬀerent determinants of the spread
1Other determinants of liquidity discussed in the literature are the depth of the order book

and market resiliency [10, 11].

2This is also discussed as the free option trading problem in the literature, see e.g. [12] and

refs. therein.

2

from empirical data, some drastic assumptions must be made. For example, as-
suming the order ﬂow to be short-ranged correlated, Huang and Stoll [8] ﬁnd
that 90% of the spread is associated to order processing costs, and not to ad-
verse selection (which is often found to have, within this framework, a negative
contribution to the spread!). This is surprising, both because these processing
costs are objectively at least ten times smaller than the spread, in particular on
electronic markets, where the spread is found to comparable to the spread in
markets with specialists. One reason for the discrepancy is the assumption that
the order imbalance has only short-ranged correlation, and therefore that impact
is permanent, in striking disagreement with empirical data, where the order ﬂow
is found to be a long-memory process [13, 14], and price impact transient, but
decaying very slowly [13, 15].

Some important ingredient thus seems to be missing. Still, both adverse
selection and inventory risk suggest a positive correlation between the spread
and the volatility of the traded asset. This makes perfect intuitive sense, and
the aim of the present paper is to clarify in detail the origin of this relation.
Positive correlation between spread and volatility is indeed found empirically
(see [16, 4, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]), but is not particularly spectacular and stands
as one among other correlations, e.g., with traded volume, ﬂow of limit orders,
market capitalization, etc. Here, we want to argue theoretically, and demonstrate
empirically on diﬀerent markets, that there is in fact a very strong correlation
between the spread and the volatility per trade, rather than with the volatility per
unit time. Such a relation was ﬁrst noted on the case of France-Telecom [13], and
independently on the stocks of the ftse-100 [22], but no theoretical argument
was given in favor of this relation.

From a theoretical point of view, several statistical models of limit and mar-
ket order ﬂows have been analyzed to understand the distribution of the bid-ask
spread, and relate its average value to ﬂow and cancellation rates [3, 23, 24, 25,
27, 26, 28, 29]. Some models include strategic considerations in order placement
and look for a trade-oﬀ between the cost of delayed execution and that of imme-
diacy, but suppose that the price dynamics is bounded in a ﬁnite interval [24],
therefore neglecting the long term volatility of the price (see also [28, 29]). As
such, these ﬁnite band models have nothing to say about the spread-volatility
relationship. Another line of models discards all strategic components (“Zero
intelligence models”) and assume Poisson rates for limit orders, market orders
and cancellation [25, 27, 26]. One can then compute both the average bid-ask
spread and the long-term volatility as a function of these Poisson rates, and
compare these predictions with empirical data [30]. The problem with such mod-
els is that although the order ﬂow is completely random, the persistence of the
order book leads to strong non-diﬀusive short term predictability of the price,
which would be very easily picked up by high frequency execution engines by
adequately conditioning the order ﬂow (limit versus market orders) to optimize

3

execution costs.3 In other words, as shown in [13, 14, 32], there are in fact very
strong high frequency correlations in the order ﬂow coming from the ‘hide and
seek’ game played by buyers and sellers around the order book. For small tick
stocks, the total available volume in the order book at any instant in time is in
10−4 of the market capitalization,
fact extremely small, on the order of 10−5
because liquidity providers want to avoid giving a free trading option to informed
traders. Conversely, this state of aﬀairs forces liquidity takers to cut their total
order in small chunks [33]. This necessarily creates long term correlation in the
order ﬂow, which in turn entices more latent liquidity to reveal itself – all traders
seeking to optimize their execution costs (see e.g.
[34]). This precisely means
that on electronic markets the cost of limit and market orders should be very
similar.

−

In the following, we show that this important average symmetry between
market and limit orders allows us to relate the average price impact of a market
order and the bid-ask spread, a relation that we check empirically. We then argue
that the impact function must be related to the volatility per trade, a property
that we again check on data. This allows us to establish a proportionality relation
between the spread and volatility per trade, which holds both across diﬀerent
stocks and for a given stock across time, both on electronic markets and on the
nyse. Our symmetry argument should be very general and robust, and shows
that in a competitive electronic market the bid-ask spread can in fact only come
from “adverse selection”, provided one extends this notion to account for the fact
that a trade can be uninformed but still impact the price. What is relevant here
is that any unexpected component of the market order ﬂow, whether it is truly
informed or just random, impacts the price and creates a cost for limit orders,
which must be compensated by the spread (see [13, 15]).

2 Limit orders vs market orders and market im-

pact

2.1 A market making strategy

Our aim is to compare the relative costs of limit and market orders. To do
so we compute the gain of a simple market making strategy which consists in
participating to all trades through limit orders. If this strategy has a positive
gain, then limit orders are clearly more favorable than market orders. Otherwise
market orders are preferable. More precisely, we consider a market maker with a
time horizon T (where T is measured in trade time) who provides an inﬁnitesimal
fraction φ of the total available liquidity. The market maker posts limit orders
both at the bid and at the ask. We assume that he participates to a fraction φ

3More elaborated ‘weak intelligence’ models have been studied recently, see [31].

of all traded volume. His gains will come from the spread S, which is in general
time dependent, except on large tick markets where the spread is nearly always
equal to one tick. Since this market making strategy generates typical inventory
imbalances of order √T which is risky, we impose that the market maker has a
perfectly balanced inventory at the end of the period T . As we show now, this
has a cost.

The optimal strategy to use to ensure that the market maker’s position is
ﬂat at time T is an interesting problem in itself, but its solution depends on the
statistics and correlations in the order ﬂow. We will thus assume a sub-optimal,
but universal strategy, which is to use a market order to sell back (or buy back) at
time T the whole position he has accumulated over the trading period [0, T
1].
This suboptimal strategy will lead to a lower bound on the gains, and therefore
an upper bound on the spread which will turn out to be in very good agreement
with empirical data.4 We will call vi the volume of the ith market order, and
ǫi the sign of that market order (ǫ = +1 for a buy and ǫ =
1 for a sell). The
volume V and its sign ε accumulated by the market maker is deﬁned as:

We assume that φ
1 is suﬃciently small to neglect the impact of the market
maker when he sells (buys) back at time T at the current mid-quote PT (plus
or minus half the current spread ST ). Even in that case, unwinding the position

is costly on average because the change of price PT −
εV : when the crowd buys, the price is impacted and goes up while the market
making strategy accumulates a short position which is costly to buy back at time
T , and vice-versa.

How can one measure the impact of a market order? Suppose a market order
of size vi and of sign ǫi is launched at a trade-time i; the subsequent mid-point

before the ith trade.) We shall deﬁne, following [13], the average impact

of the
market maker can be obtained by noting that if ǫi is the sign of the market order,
the transaction price is Pi + ǫiSi/2, where Si is spread prevailing just before the
market order is emitted. 5 Therefore the total gain of this strategy is given by:

This expression shows clearly that the gain of the market maker is determined
by the competition between the spread (ﬁrst term) and the impact of market
orders (second term). We will neglect the last term for T large, since V grows
sub-linearly with T ,6 while the ﬁrst two terms grow linearly with T . Using the
above deﬁnition of the average impact function, one obtains for the average gain
of the market making strategy, per unit of traded volume and per unit time, the

Eq.(4) is our central result;

it shows that the market maker gain can be
computed entirely from empirical data, without having to make any assumption
on the fraction of informed trades. In fact, trades need not be informed at all;
provided their average impact is non zero, these trades inﬂict losses upon market
makers.

From the factorization property of

expressed as:

Both the half spread term V ST /2 and any market impact, neglected in the above
formula, reduce the gain of the market maker and therefore reinforce the inequal-
ity.

5The following computation neglects the fact that one single large market order may trigger
transactions at several diﬀerent prices, up the order book ladder. Nevertheless this situation is
empirically quite rare, and corresponds to only a few percents of all cases [35].

2.2 Limit/market order symmetry

The gain g of the above simple market making strategy also corresponds, by
deﬁnition, to the average cost of a market order.
In electronic markets, any
agents can choose to execute through limit or market orders, or any mixture of
those. Thus, both types of orders must have very similar cost. Any imbalance
is easy to detect because of the very large number of orders per day that allows
quantitative trading houses to obtain reliable estimates of these costs. If market
orders were too costly, limit orders would be preferred, leading to a reduction of
the spread and therefore a reduction of the cost of market orders.7 If limit orders
were too costly, more market orders would be used, leading to a widening of the
average spread. Therefore the spread should stabilize such that one average limit
orders and market orders have an equal cost. This symmetry assumption appears
reasonable in markets without privileged operators who can manipulate the order
ﬂow, which means that it should even hold for liquid stocks of the NYSE where
the large ﬂow of limit orders not coming from the specialists insures some sort
of equilibrium. This equal cost assumption is equivalent to g
0, or, using the
above result:

is artiﬁcially bounded from below. See the discussion in section 2.5

Before comparing this prediction with empirical results, let us consider a simple
market where the spread would be constant and all market orders would have the
same size v with independent signs ǫ. In this case, the impact function is time
independent [13], and Eq.(7) reduces to:

In economical terms, this equality has a very simple meaning: it indicates that
on average, the new mid-price after the transaction Pi+1 = Pi + ǫiR
is equal to
the last transaction price Pi + ǫiS/2.

2.3 Comparison with empirical data: small tick electronic

markets

We ﬁrst consider small tick electronic markets, such as the Paris Stock Exchange
(pse) or Index Futures. The case of large tick stocks is diﬀerent since in this case
the spread is (nearly) always one tick, with huge volumes at both the bid and
the ask. The case of such markets will be considered below.

We studied extensively the set of the 68 most liquid stocks of the pse during
the year 2002. The summary statistics describing these stocks is given in the
Appendix. From the Trades and Quotes data, one has access the the bid-ask just
before each trade, from which one can obtain the sign and the volume of each
trade (depending on whether the trade happened at the ask or at the bid) and
the mid-point just before the trade. From this information, one computes the
quantities of interest, such as the instantaneous impact function
or the spread
S. Note that we have removed ‘block trades’, which appear as transactions with
volumes larger than what is available at the best price that are not followed by a
change of quotes. This represent typically a 5
10% fraction of the total number
of trades.

We test Eq.(7) in two diﬀerent ways – for a given stock across time, and across
all diﬀerent stocks. Since both the spread and impact vary with time, one can

iv over a number of successive trades. In the example of Fig. 2,

sponding to 2 days of trading in the case of France Telecom in 2002. Doing so we
obtain quantities that vary by a factor 5 that allows us to test the linear depen-
dence predicted by Eq.(7). Our result shown in Fig.2 is in very good agreement
with the theoretical bound; note that the bound is violated only on rather rare
occasions, even on averages over rather short time scales. A linear ﬁt gives a
slope equal to 2.14, corresponding to λ = 1.07.8 As expected for highly liquid

We also test Eq.(7) cross sectionally in Fig. 3, using the above 68 diﬀerent
stocks of the pse. The relative values of the spread and the average impact also
varies by a factor 5 between the diﬀerent stocks, which enables to test the linear
relation (7). Once again we ﬁnd a good agreement with the predicted bound,
and the linear ﬁt gives a slope of 2.86, or λ
1.43, corresponding to a market
making horizon of roughly 20 trades (see Fig. 1).

It is also interesting to analyze small tick Futures markets, for which the
typical spread is ten times smaller than on stock markets. We have studied a
series of small tick Index Futures in 2005 (except the mib for which the data
is 2004), again both as a function of time and across the 7 indexes of our set.
Results are shown in Fig. 4; the bound is again very well obeyed both across
contracts and across time, even when the time averaging is restricted to only 1000
consecutive trades. This shows that on these highly liquid contracts, where the
transaction rate as high as a few per second, the equilibrium between limit and
market orders is reached very quickly.

2.4 Comparison with empirical data: NYSE stocks
The case of the nyse is quite interesting since the market is still ruled by special-
ists, who however compete to provide liquidity with other market participants

posted by the specialist. Once again we ﬁnd a good agreement with the predicted
bound, although in this case, the gap between the bound and the empirical points
is substantially larger than in the case of the pse. This translates into a signiﬁ-
cantly larger slope of 3.96, which suggests that, perhaps not surprisingly, market
makers on the nyse post spreads that are systematically over-estimated com-
pared to the situation in electronic markets. This result is in agreement with
the study of Harris and Hasbrouck performed in the nineties on the nyse [37],
which showed that limit orders were more favorable than market orders. Quite
interestingly, our analysis allows us to compare in a simple and meaningful way
the spread in diﬀerent markets.

2.5 The case of large tick electronic markets

The string of arguments leading to Eq. (7) does not directly apply in the case
where the tick size is large. In that case the spread S is most of the time stuck
to its minimum value, i.e. one tick, while the size of the queue q at the bid and
at the ask tends to be extremely large (see e.g. Appendix, Table 3). Because of
the large value of the spread, limit orders are a priori favorable, but huge limit
order volumes accumulate as liquidity providers attempt to take advantage of the

11

≈

−

spread. The size of the queue q at the bid or at the ask is thus much larger than the
0.01 (see Table

which assumes that one can participate to a small fraction of all transactions,
cannot be implemented. We thus expect that the spread on these markets will be
substantially larger than predicted by the bound Eq.(7), because the competition

2.6 Comparison with empirical data: conclusion

Our empirical analysis shows that on small tick electronic markets, an approxi-
mate symmetry between limit and market orders indeed hold, in the sense that
the spread is very nearly equal to minimum value needed for market making to
be proﬁtable. On the nyse, spreads appears to be signiﬁcantly larger but the
predicted linear relation between spread and impact still holds. Similarly, a large
value of the tick size thwarts the full expression of the symmetry between market
and limit orders.

3 Liquidity vs. volatility

3.1 A simple model

Consider again the simple model discussed above where all market orders have
the same size and are not correlated in time. In this case, the impact function
R
is constant over time [13], and the volatility per trade σ1 is therefore easily found
to be σ1 =

. Using Eq.(8) one obtains:

R

σ1 =

S
2

(9)

In what follows we argue that this simple idea is still valid in the more realistic
case where market orders are distributed in volume and, more importantly, have
long term correlations in sign.

3.2 The situation in real markets

It is now a well established fact that order ﬂow has long term memory, in the sense
that the correlation function of the market order signs C(ℓ) =
decays for

ǫiǫi+ℓi

h

large ℓ as ℓ−γ, with an exponent γ less than unity, i.e. the sign correlation function
is in fact non summable [13, 14].9 Naively, this should lead to strong correlations
in the price dynamics. However, these correlations are nearly perfectly oﬀset
by market resiliency, i.e. an adapted reaction of the limit order ﬂow and the
dynamics of quotes to the ﬂow of market orders [13, 32, 14]. As a result, the
price is nearly perfectly diﬀusive.

The instantaneous impact
for two reasons. First, the impact appears to follow the liquidity of the market
measured by the spread (see section 2). On the pse, the spread has a distribution
close to an exponential, hence one has
2 (see Table 2,
h
Appendix).10 Second, recall that the impact is measured between two market
orders, in between which a lot may happen. Large impact ﬂuctuations could arise
from external news, which may induce large quote revisions due to cancellation
of limit orders but with no transactions, resulting in large jumps of the price,
unrelated to the trading activity.
In order to account for this possibility, we

A speciﬁc model for this Einstein-like relation was worked out in [13], and tested
on France-Telecom (see also [38]). Here, we establish that this relation holds
quite precisely across diﬀerent stocks: see Fig. (6). Perhaps surprisingly, the
exogenous quote revision contribution Σ2 appears to be small. This might be
related to the observation made in Farmer et al. [35] that for most price jumps,
some limit orders are too slowly cancelled and get ‘grabbed’ by fast market orders,
which means that these events in fact contribute to
1. In the following, we will
therefore neglect Σ2, as suggested by Fig. (6): in this sense the volatility of the
stock can be fully explained by market impact.

R

Our ﬁnal assumption is that of universality, i.e. when the tick size is small
enough and the typical number of shares traded is large enough, all stocks should
behave identically up to a rescaling of the average spread and the average volume.
The universality of the shape of the order book was indeed checked to hold rather
well in [27]. This means that, for example,

the constants introduced above as c = 2λb′/√a′b. This very simple relation
between volatility per trade and average spread was noted in [13, 22], and we
present further data in the next section to support this conjecture. Therefore, the
constraints that (i) high frequency execution strategies impose that the price is
diﬀusive [Eq. (10)], and (ii) the cost of limit and market orders are equal [Eq.(7)],
lead to a simple relation between liquidity and volatility. As an important remark,
note that the above relation is not expected to hold for the volatility per unit
time σ, since it involves an extra stock-dependent and time-dependent quantity,
namely the the trading frequency ν, through:

σ = σ1√ν.

4 Discussion and conclusion

The main theoretical result of this paper is the possibility to express the proﬁt
of simple market-making strategies directly in terms of the spread and the im-
pact function. This relation does not require any assumption on the fraction of
informed trades; in fact our result holds even if trades are all uninformed but
impact the price. Imposing that the strategy leads to a zero average gain allows
one to derive a linear equation between spread and impact. This relation is in
good agreement with empirical data on small tick contracts, with a slope com-
patible with the zero gain hypothesis. This implies that limit and market orders
have similar costs and therefore play symmetric roles in electronic markets, at
least when the tick size is small. This result is in fact expected since all mar-
ket participants can choose to use one type of order or the other; any persistent
assymetry would be easily detected and be corrected (see below). This means,
quite interestingly, that minimization of execution costs leads to self-organization
of liquidity in electronic markets (at least in normal conditions). Our analysis
allows us to compare in an objective way the spreads in diﬀerent markets and
suggests that spreads are distinctly too large on the nyse.

Making reasonable further assumptions, we have then shown that spread S
and volatility per trade σ1 are also proportional, a result that we conﬁrm empir-
ically. This very simple relation sheds light on the debate in the literature about
the determinants of the bid-ask spread, and suggests that the bid-ask spread is
dominated by adverse selection, if one considers that the volatility per trade is
a measure of the amount of ‘information’ included in prices at each transaction.
There are two complementary economic interpretations of the relation σ1
S in
small tick markets: (i) since the typical available liquidity in the order book is
quite small, market orders tend to grab a signiﬁcant fraction of the volume at
the best price; furthermore, the size of the ‘gap’ above the ask or below the bid
is observed to be on the same order of magnitude as the bid-ask spread which
therefore sets a natural scale for price variations. Hence both the impact and
the volatility per trade are expected to be of the order of S, as observed; (ii) the
relation can also be read backwards as S
σ1: when the volatility per trade is
large, the risk of placing limit orders is large and therefore the spread widens until
limit orders become favorable. Therefore, there is a clear two-way feedback that
imposes the relation σ1
S, valid on average; any signiﬁcant deviation tends to
be corrected by the resulting relative ﬂow of limit and market orders. Our result
therefore appears as a fundamental property of the markets organization, which
should be satisﬁed within any theoretical description of the micro-structure. Zero
intelligence models [30], for example, fail to predict any universal relation between
S and σ1.

Our relation involves the volatility per trade whereas most of the economet-
ric work has instead focused on the volatility per unit time σ. The relation
between the two involves the trading frequency ν, which is itself time- and stock-

18

dependent. As a function of time, we ﬁnd, in agreement with [42], that volatility
per trade and trading frequency are positively correlated; the volatility σ = σ1√ν
therefore increases because both σ1 and ν increase.12 Across stocks, on the other
hand, the volatility per unit time does not exhibit systematic variations with
ϕ, whereas the trading frequency increases with capital-
capitalization
ization as ν
0
and ζ
0.44 [22], while for US stocks the scaling for ν is less clear [43]. Interest-
ingly, our result then leads to a result between average spread and capitalization

The fundamental question at this stage is to know what ﬁxes the volatility σ
and the trading frequency ν. Clearly, the trading frequency has to do with the
available liquidity and the way large volumes have to be cut in small pieces. But
is the volatility per unit time the primary object, driven by a fundamental process
such as the arrival of news, to which the volatility per trade and therefore the
spread is slaved? Or on the contrary is the market micro-structure and trading
activity imposing, in a bottom-up way, the value of the volatility? Understanding
these coupled dynamical problems appears to be a major challenge for the theory
of ﬁnancial markets, and an unavoidable step to understand the interrelation
between liquidity and market eﬃciency [9, 44, 18, 19, 36, 13, 14, 45].

We want to thank J. D. Farmer, Th. Foucault and G. Zumbach for useful

discussions.

Appendix: Summary statistics

12The long-memory property of σ is actually argued to be related to long range correlation

in the trading frequency rather than in the volatility per trade, see [41].

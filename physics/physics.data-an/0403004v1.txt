The special problem of transport in 2-dimensional divergence-free stochastic velocity ﬁelds is studied
by developing a statistical approach, the nested subensemble method. The nonlinear process of
trapping determined by such ﬁelds generates trajectory structures whose statistical characteristics
are determined. These structures strongly inﬂuence the transport.

I. INTRODUCTION

Test particle motion in stochastic velocity ﬁelds is a
generic problem in various topics of ﬂuid and plasma
turbulence or solid state physics [1]- [4]. This problem
was very much studied and several analytical approaches
were developed. Most of them are based on Corrsin [5],
[1] and direct-interaction [6], [7] approximations.

In this context, particle motion in 2-dimensional
divergence-free velocity ﬁelds represents a special case.
Kraichnan has shown for the ﬁrst time, in a study based
on numerical simulations [8], that the existing analyti-
cal methods are not adequate for this type of problems.
The cause of this anomaly is the trapping of the parti-
cles, which appears in such velocity ﬁelds when they have
slow time variation. The trapping consists in trajectory
winding on almost closed paths. A typical trajectory has
a complicated shape with such localized trapping events
separated by long jumps. Consequently, the probability
distribution function is non-Gaussian. Thus Corrsin and
direct-interaction approximation which are based on this
hypothesis are not adequate for this speciﬁc case. A more
recent analysis of the eﬀects of trapping is presented in
Ref. [9] where a non-Gaussian peaked distribution of the
displacements and a long negative tail in the Lagrangian
velocity correlations are evidenced for numerically calcu-
lated trajectories.

This special problem of diﬀusion in 2-dimensional
divergence-free velocity ﬁelds describes for instance the
transport in turbulent magnetized plasmas or in incom-
pressible ﬂuids. It was studied especially by means of di-
rect numerical simulations ( [10] and the reference there
in) or on the basis of simpliﬁed models [11], [12]. There is
also a qualitative theoretical estimation of the scale law
for the asymptotic diﬀusion coeﬃcient [13] based on an
analogy with the percolation process in stochastic land-
scapes. The case of collisional particle motion in such
static velocity ﬁelds was analyzed by means of the renor-
malization group techniques ( [2] and the references there
in) and the asymptotic time behavior of the mean square
displacement was determined. The evolution of the diﬀu-

1

sion process is determined only in [14] where a statistical
approach, the decorrelation trajectory method, is devel-
oped. It yields analytical expressions for the time depen-
dent diﬀusion coeﬃcient D(t) and for the correlation of
the Lagrangian velocity L(t), that are qualitatively valid
for the whole range of the Kubo number (see next Section
for the deﬁnitions). The basic idea consists of determin-
ing the Lagrangian velocity correlation by means of a set
of average Lagrangian velocities estimated in subensem-
bles of realizations of the stochastic ﬁeld. This method
could be extended to more complicated physical systems
which contain particle collisions [15], average velocities
[16] or a supplementary component of the motion perpen-
dicular to the 2-dimensional plane [17], [18]. It was shown
that the presence of trapping strongly inﬂuences the dif-
fusion coeﬃcients and their scaling laws determining a
rich class of anomalous diﬀusion regimes. These stud-
ies have shown that the decorrelation trajectory method
provides a qualitatively good description of the trapping
process. However, due to the rather strong approxima-
tion introduced in this method (see Section III), there
are several qualitative aspects that are not well described
[19], [20]. They are related to trajectory ﬂuctuations and
their correlation with the stochastic velocity.

The above results concern the eﬀect of trapping on
the individual trajectories. The trapping has also col-
lective eﬀects. It determines coherence in the stochastic
motion in the sense that bundles of neighboring trajec-
tories form localized structures similar with ﬂuid vor-
tices. The formation of these structures strongly inﬂu-
ences the transport. The aim of this paper is to study
the statistical characteristics of these trajectory struc-
tures determined by the intrinsic trapping appearing in
2-dimensional divergence-free stochastic velocity ﬁelds.
The average, the dispersion and the probability distribu-
tion function for the trajectories in such structures are
determined. The evolution of these statistical quanti-
ties saturates showing that they do not contribute to
the asymptotic transport. The statistical evolution of
the distance between two neighboring trajectories is also
studied and its mean, dispersion and probability distri-

bution are determined. We show that for the trapped
trajectories in a static velocity ﬁeld, the average decays
to zero and the dispersion remains very small for long
time and eventually saturates. A very strong clump ef-
fect is found for the trapped trajectories. This demon-
strates the existence of trajectory structures and their
eﬀect of strongly reducing the relative transport. The
later is produced only by a small part of the stochas-
tic trajectories which are not contained in these vortical
trajectory structures.

The method developed for this study is a semi-
analytical statistical approach which extends and im-
proves the decorrelation trajectory method [14] by in-
troducing the ﬂuctuations of the trajectories in the
subensembles.

II. THE PROBLEM

Particle motion in a 2-dimensional stochastic velocity

ﬁeld is described by the nonlinear Langevin equation:

dx(t)
dt

= v [x(t), t] ,

x(0) = 0

(1)

where x(t) represents the trajectory in Cartesian coordi-
(x1, x2). The stochastic velocity ﬁeld v(x, t) is
nates x
≡
v(x, t) = 0 and thus its two compo-
divergence-free:
nents v1 an v2 can be determined from a stochastic scalar
ﬁeld φ(x, t), as:

∇ ·

vi(x, t) = εij

∂φ(x, t)
∂xj

(2)

where εij is the antisymmetric tensor (ε12 = 1, ε21 =
1,
ε11 = ε22 = 0). In the studies of turbulence of magne-
tized plasmas, φ(x, t) is essentially the potential (φ =
φe/B where φe(x, t) is the electrostatic potential and
−
B is the magnetic ﬁeld strength) and in ﬂuid turbulence
φ(x, t)e3 is the stream function (e3 is the unitary vector
along the axis perpendicular on the plane (x1, x2)).

−

The potential φ(x, t) is considered to be a stationary
and homogeneous Gaussian stochastic ﬁeld, with zero av-
erage and given two-point Eulerian correlation function
(EC)

alizations of φ(x, t). The statistical properties of the
space derivatives of the potential are completely deter-
mined by those of the potential. They are station-
ary and homogeneous Gaussian stochastic ﬁelds like
φ(x, t). The two-point Eulerian correlations of the
derivatives of φ(x, t) are obtained as derivatives of
the potential EC, E(x, t). We introduce the notation
Ei..;k..(x, t)
where

φi(x, t)
indices of the derivatives of the potential in x1, t1 (left
factor) separated by semicolon from the indices of the
derivatives of the potential in x1 + x, t1 + t (right factor).
The absence of indices correspond to a factor φ inside the
average (see Eqs. (5) for examples). One obtains

with n equal to the number of derivatives of the ﬁrst

the velocity v(x, t) is such a stationary and homogeneous
Gaussian stochastic ﬁeld. The correlation of the velocity
components and the potential-velocity correlations are
obtained using the deﬁnition (2) of the velocity and Eq.

These correlations (4)-(5) will be used in the following
calculations.

The potential is a continuous function of x and t in
each realization and it determines an unique trajectory
as the solution Eq. (1). Starting from the above statis-
tical description of the stochastic potential and from an
explicit EC, E(x, t), one has to determine the statistical
properties of the trajectories. The later can be obtained
from the Lagrangian velocity correlation (LVC), deﬁned
by:

The probability distribution function of the trajectories
can be obtained from the equation for particle density,
once the LVC is known [22]. Thus, the solution of the

above Langevin problem consists essentially in determin-
ing the LVC (6) corresponding to a given EC (3) of the
stochastic potential.

This kind of Langevin problem, sometimes named in
the literature diﬀusion by continuous movements, is non-
linear due to the space dependence of the potential, which
leads to x-dependence of the EC (3). The importance of
the nonlinearity is characterized by the Kubo number
deﬁned by

K =

V τc
λc

(9)

where V is the amplitude of the stochastic velocity, τc
is the correlation time and λc is the correlation length.
These parameters appear in the EC of the velocity as
the maximum value in the origin [V 2 = Eii(0, 0)] and
the characteristic decay time and length of this functions.
The Kubo number is thus the ratio of τc to the average
time of ﬂight of the particles over the correlation length,
τf l = λc/V.
It measures the particle’s capacity of ex-
ploring the space structure of the stochastic velocity ﬁeld
before it changes.

For small Kubo numbers the time variation of the ve-
locity ﬁeld is fast and the particles cannot ”see” the space
structure of the velocity ﬁeld. The condition K

τf l) deﬁnes the quasilinear regime (or the weak
(τc ≪
turbulence case) for which the results are well estab-
lished: the diﬀusion coeﬃcient is Dql = ( λ2
c/τc)K 2 and
the trajectories have Gaussian distribution.

≪

For K > 1 (τc > τf l) the time variation of the stochas-
tic potential is slow and the trajectories approximately
follow the contour lines of φ(x, t). This produces a trap-
ping eﬀect : the trajectories are conﬁned for long periods
in small regions. A typical trajectory shows an alterna-
tion of large displacements and trapping events. The lat-
ter appear when the particles are close to the maxima or
minima of the potential and consist of trajectory winding
on almost closed small size paths. The large displace-
ments are produced when the trajectories are at small
absolute values of the potential. Thus there is a strong
inﬂuence of trapping on individual trajectories. Trajec-
tory trapping appears for K > 1 and becomes stronger
as K increases up to the limit of static ﬁeld (K, τc =
)
∞
where the trapping is permanent. It determines the de-
crease of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient and the change of its
dependence on the Kubo number from the Bohm scal-
ing [23], [24], DB ∼

in a time dependent potential.

Besides this inﬂuence on individual trajectories, the
trapping has collective eﬀects and it generates trajectory
structures similar with ﬂuid vortices. The trapping ap-
pears coherently for bundles of neighboring trajectories
leading to eddying regions. We analyze here the statis-
tical characteristics of these trajectory structures. We
show that the dispersion of the trapped trajectories sat-
urates and that the mean square of the distance between
trajectories evolve slowly and eventually saturates. The
motion of trapped particles is almost coherent and leads
to structures which do not contribute to the transport
(trajectory dispersion) nor to the relative transport.

III. THE NESTED SUBENSEMBLE METHOD

We start from the main idea of the decorrelation tra-
jectory method [14]. It consists in studying the Langevin
equation (1) in subensembles (S) of realizations of the
stochastic ﬁeld, which are determined by given values of
the potential and of the velocity in the starting point of
the trajectories:

(S) :

φ(0, 0) = φ0, v(0, 0) = v0.

(10)

We note that similar subensemble averages of the Eu-
lerian stochastic velocity ﬁeld were studied in Ref. [25]
with the aim of showing that eddies and structures exist
even in isotropic turbulence. Subensemble Lagrangian
averages are estimated in [26] on the basis of a rather
strong assumption and in [12] for a model of rotating
ﬂuid layers. Our approach is diﬀerent.

The statistical properties of the stochastic potential
and velocity, reduced in the subensemble (S) deﬁned by
condition (10) are derived in [14]. They are Gaussian
ﬁelds but non-stationary and non-homogeneous, with
space and time dependent averages and dispersions. The
averages depend on the parameters of the subensemble
and are deﬁned by

≡ h

≡ h

v [x, t]

φ(x, t)

ΦE(x,t; S)

iS , VE(x,t; S)

iS (11)
where
iS denotes the average taken on the realiza-
...
h
tions in (S) and the superscript E is used to underline
the Eulerian nature of these quantities. They are equal to
the corresponding imposed condition (10) in x = 0 and
t = 0 and decay to zero at large distance and/or time.
The mean squares of the potential and velocity ﬂuctu-
ations are zero in x = 0, t = 0 and increase up to the
values corresponding to the whole set of realizations at
large distance and/or time. The existence of an average
Eulerian velocity in the subensemble determines an aver-
age motion (decorrelation trajectory). This decorrelation
trajectory is estimated in each subensemble and an ap-
proximation for the LVC is derived in terms of the set of
these trajectories.

More precisely, the LVC (6) for the whole set of re-
alizations is obtained by summing up the contributions
of each subensemble. The latter can be written as
vi [x(0), 0] vj [x(t), t]
iS. Thus, the
h
problem of evaluating the LVC reduces to the determina-
tion of the average Lagrangian velocity in each subensem-
ble (S), VL(t; S)
iS. This is one of the ad-
vantages brought by the subensemble analysis: the two-
point LVC (6) can be expressed as a function of one-point
averages (VL(t; S)) in subensembles which correspond to
given initial velocity:

The approximation introduced in the decorrelation tra-
jectory method is in the estimation of VL(t; S) and es-
sentially consists in neglecting the ﬂuctuations of the tra-
jectories around the average trajectory in (S). Thus the
average Lagrangian velocity in (S) is approximated with
the average Eulerian velocity calculated along the aver-
age trajectory:

iS . Then, this average trajectory in (S) (decorrela-

(15)

the approximation (14) are periodic and evolve on closed
paths. They provide a representation of the trapping
and lead to a subdiﬀusive transport for the static poten-
tial and to trapping scaling for the asymptotic diﬀusion
K γ with γ < 1, in time dependent
coeﬃcient, Dtr ∼
stochastic potentials with slow variation (K > 1).

The approximation (14) seems to be rather rough but,
because it is performed in the subensemble, there are
two aspects which contribute to improving its accuracy.
One is due to the fact that the ﬂuctuations of the ve-
locity in (S), which are the source of the trajectory ﬂuc-
tuations, are zero in the starting point of the trajecto-
ries and become important only if the trajectory reaches
large enough distances. The second is related to the fact
that the trajectories in the subensemble are superdeter-
mined. Besides the necessary and suﬃcient initial condi-
tion x(0) = 0, they have supplementary initial conditions
determined by the deﬁnition (10) of the subensembles.
This reduces the diﬀerences between the trajectories in
(S) and thus the ﬂuctuations. The ﬁrst description of
the trapping process in qualitative agreement with the
numerical simulations was obtained using this approxi-
mations [14]- [18]. However, there are important qualita-
tive aspects that are not obtained from this approxima-
tion. The most evident concerns the average trajectory
in the subensemble. In the static case the trajectory in
each realization (solution of (1)) is periodic but the aver-
age of such trajectories cannot be periodic (as obtained
from (16)) since they have diﬀerent periods (distributed
around some average value which depends on (S)). An-
other aspect is discussed in [19], [20] and concerns the
average Lagrangian velocity in a biased stochastic poten-
tial. It is thus necessary to improve the decorrelation tra-
jectory method by taking into account the ﬂuctuations of
the trajectories in the subensembles. This development
is also required by the aim of this paper. The decorrela-
tion trajectory method as presented in [14] is not able to
describe the statistics of the trajectories in (S) nor the
two-particle statistical quantities.

The analysis of the decorrelation trajectory method
leads to the conclusion that this method succeeds in de-
scribing the trajectory trapping due to the fact that it
maintains the invariance of the average Lagrangian po-
tential in (S). The motion described by Eqs. (1), (2) has
the velocity at any moment perpendicular to the gra-
dient of the potential in the instantaneous position x(t)
and the time variation of the Lagrangian potential is pro-
duced only by the explicit time dependence of φ(x, t)

tude potentials such that τc > τf l
(i.e. K > 1), ∂φ/∂t
is small and there is an approximate invariance of the
potential along the trajectory in each realization. Tra-
jectory trapping is essentially related to this invariance
of the Lagrangian potential.

The average Lagrangian potential in (S) is invariant in
the frame of the decorrelation trajectory method. Indeed,
one obtains, by neglecting trajectory ﬂuctuations as in
(14), the average Lagrangian potential in (S) as
i ∼= ΦE [X(t, S), t; S] .

ΦL(t; S)

Since the Eulerian quantities VE(x, t; S) and ΦE(x, t; S)
are related by an equation similar to (2)

(19)

the time derivative of (18) is zero for the static case
and, due to the deﬁnition (10) of the subensembles (S),
ΦL(t; S) = ΦE(0; S) = φ0 at any time.

The aim of this paper is to consider the ﬂuctuations
of the trajectories in the subensemble (S) and to study
their eﬀect. The approximations (14), (14) that neglect
trajectory ﬂuctuations have to be replaced. As suggested
by the above discussions, this development must be per-
formed having in mind the idea of maintaining the con-
dition of invariance of ΦL(t; S). Moreover, the invariance
of the Lagrangian potential applies to each trajectory,
i.e.
in each realization. Thus, it determines, besides
the invariance of ΦL(t; S), other statistical constraints.
Actually, in the static case the probability distribution
function for the Lagrangian potential in a subensemble
(S) is

(20)

because φ [x(t)] = φ0 for all trajectories in (S) and for any
time moment. We note that the knowledge of P S(φ, t) is
not very helpful in solving the problem of determining the
statistical properties of the trajectories but it rather im-
poses strong conditions on the possible approximations.
For example, the hypothesis that trajectory ﬂuctuations
in (S) are Gaussian around the average trajectory is ex-
cluded by Eq. (20). It can be shown that such distri-
bution is not compatible with the δ-distribution of the
Lagrangian potential.

Trajectory ﬂuctuations in the subensembles (S) are
considered here in agreement with the condition (20) by
separating the realizations in (S) in subensembles (S2)
corresponding to ﬁxed values of the second derivatives of
the potential in x = 0, t = 0

approximately determined by neglecting trajectory ﬂuc-
tuations in (S2). Pushed to the subensembles (S2), this
approximation is much more accurate than taken in (S)
because the trajectories in (S2) are much more superde-
termined than those in (S): three supplementary initial
conditions (21) are added to the initial conditions (10).
Moreover, the source of trajectory ﬂuctuations, the ve-
locity ﬂuctuations, has smaller amplitude in (S2) than in
(S). Thus the accuracy of this method is much increased
compared to the accuracy of the decorrelation trajectory
method. But the main advantage of performing this de-
velopment consists in the fact that it provides for each
subensemble (S) a collection of trajectories instead of one
decorrelation trajectory. It is thus possible to determine
the statistical properties of the trajectories in (S) by per-
forming averages over the subensembles (S2) contained
in (S). We determine using this nested subensemble pro-
cedure the dispersion of the trajectories in (S) and their
probability distribution function, besides the average tra-
jectory. The statistical evolution of the distance between
two trajectories is also studied by this method and the
average, the dispersion and the probability distribution
function are determined as functions of time.

We note that this nested subensemble approach can be
further developed by introducing subensembles deﬁned
by higher order derivatives of the potential, (S3), (S4),
.... This systematic expansion fulﬁls at each order higher
than 1 all the conditions required by the invariance of
the Lagrangian potential. It is however expected that the
main statistical properties of the stochastic trajectories in
(S) are already obtained at the second order and that the
higher orders contribute with corrections to these results.
The nested subensembles (S), (S2) are considered in this
study.

The explicit calculations consist of the following steps.
First, the statistical properties of the stochastic potential
and velocity, reduced in the subensemble (S2) deﬁned by
conditions (21) and (10) are derived. Namely, the prob-
ability that a realization belongs to a subensemble (S2)
and the subensemble average Eulerian velocity and po-
tential are determined. These average quantities lead to
the equation for the average trajectory in (S2) by neglect-
ing the ﬂuctuations of the trajectories in (S2). Then the
statistical properties of the trajectories and of the dis-
tance between two trajectories in the subensemble (S)
are expressed as functions of the average trajectories in
all subensembles (S2) contained in (S). The calculations
are for the static stochastic potential corresponding to
the strongest trapping. The transport in time-dependent
potential is discussed in Section VI B.

The subensemble (S2) average potential (28) equals φ0
in x = 0, t = 0 and it decays to zero at large x, as the
average Eulerian potential in the upper subensemble (S).
Its expression is more complicated and depends on the
second order derivatives φ0
ij that label (S2). The poten-
tial considered only in the realizations in the subensemble
(S2) is a non-stationary and non-homogeneous Gaussian
ﬁeld having a space-time dependent average.

As in the whole ensemble and as in (S), the statistical
properties of the velocity ﬁeld in the subensemble (S2)
are deduced from those of the potential in (S2). The
velocity in the subensemble (S2) (21) is a non-stationary
and non-homogeneous Gaussian stochastic ﬁeld having
a space-time dependent average. This average Eulerian
velocity is calculated by the same procedure used for the
potential (28). The relation (2) between velocity and
potential in each realization holds between the respective
average quantities calculated in the nested subensembles.
It was obtained in the subensemble (S), Eq. (19), and it
can be shown that :

Thus the average velocity in the subensemble (S2) is

divergence-free:
It is interesting to note that the potential and the ve-
locity in the subensembles (S) and (S2) are deterministic
quantities in x = 0 (φ(0) = φ0, v(0) = v0 for all re-
alizations in (S), thus also in (S2)). As
grows, the
average values decay to zero and the ﬂuctuations build
up progressively and eventually become the same as in
the global statistical ensemble. The amplitude of the
ﬂuctuations in a point x is smaller in the subensemble
(S2) than in the subensemble (S).

This nested subensemble procedure evidences, in the
zero-average stochastic velocity ﬁeld, a set of average
velocities (corresponding to each subensemble). They
depend on the statistical characteristics of the veloc-
ity ﬁeld (the correlation and the constraint imposed in
the problem, i.e. the zero-divergence condition). In the
nested subensembles introduced here, the following re-
lation holds between the (S2) average velocities and the
(S) average velocity:

Similar equations can be written for all statistical quan-
tities deﬁned in the nested subensembles.

Similar equations hold for all the statistical quantities
corresponding to the subensemble (S). The average tra-
jectory in the subensemble (S), X(t; S)
iS , is de-
termined by averaging X(t; S2), the solution of Eq. (32)

x(t)

B. Average Lagrangian velocity in the subensemble
(S2)

The average Eulerian velocity (29) determines an av-
erage displacement in the subensemble (S2), X(t; S2). It
is the time integral of the average Lagrangian velocity in
(S2), VL(t; S2). The latter is evaluated using an approx-
imation similar to (14) as

VL(t; S2) ∼= VE [X(t; S2); S2]

(31)

by neglecting the ﬂuctuations of the trajectories in the
subensemble (S2). A nonlinear equation for X(t; S2) is
so obtained

−

dX(t, S2)
dt

= VE [X(t; S2); S2] .

(32)

With this approximation the average Lagrangian poten-
iS2 ∼= ΦE [X(t; S2); S2] and due to
tial in (S2) is
Eq.(29)

ϕ [x(t)]

VE [X(t; S2); S2] = εij

ΦE [X(t; S2); S2] .

∂Xj

which shows that Eq.
(32) has a Hamiltonian struc-
ture. The solution of this equation with the initial
condition X(0; S2) = 0 ensures the invariance of its
time-independent Hamiltonian function ΦE [X(t; S2); S].
Since the Eulerian average potential (28) has the value
φ0 in x = 0, the average Lagrangian potential equals φ0
at any time moment.

C. Lagrangian statistics in the subensemble (S)

The nested subensemble method provides

for a
subensemble (S) an ensemble of trajectories, the aver-
age trajectories X(t; S2), one for each subensemble (S2)
contained in (S). The statistical properties of these tra-
jectories can be determined performing averages over the
subensembles (S2).

The average velocity in (S), VL(t; S), is determined
by averaging VL(t; S2) obtained from the solution of
Eq.(32) over all subensembles (S2) contained in (S)

is the solution of Eq.
(32) with the initial condition
X′(0; S2) = δ0. The average, the dispersion and the pdf
of δ(t) in the subensemble (S) are determined by equa-
tions similar to (34)-(36) where X(t; S2) is replaced by

cient (8) is obtained from (12) and (34) as

analytical expression for D(t) in terms of the average
trajectory X1(t; S) is obtained in [14] by means of the
decorrelation trajectory method. But the average trajec-
tory was determined there as solution of a Hamiltonian
equation while here it is the average (34) of the average
trajectories in (S2).

IV. EXPLICIT CALCULATIONS

The nested subensemble method actually is based on
the classiﬁcation of the stochastic trajectories in groups
(subensembles) according to some resemblance between
them. The most important criterion in this classiﬁca-
tion is the value of the potential in the starting point
of the trajectories. All trajectories contained in such a
group evolve on contour lines with the same value of the
potential. Consequently their paths and periods are sta-
tistically similar in the sense that they have an average
size and period. Thus this condition determines a global
resemblance of the trajectories (extended at long time).
This condition is imposed beginning with the ﬁrst level
of classiﬁcation (in the subensembles (S)). Other criteria
of the classiﬁcation are the velocity and the derivatives of
the velocity in the origin. These are not conserved quan-
tities ant they inﬂuence the shape of the trajectory only
at small time for time intervals that grow with the num-
ber of imposed conditions. The value of the initial veloc-
ity is ﬁxed in the subensemble (S), then each subensem-
ble (S) is divided in smaller subensembles (S2) according
to the value of the derivatives of the velocity (second
derivatives of the potential). This classiﬁcation can con-
tinue in principle and at each step the resemblance of
the trajectories contained in a group is increased and the
number of groups grows. The approximation consists in
neglecting the diﬀerences between the trajectories in a
group. With this condition it is possible to determine
an average trajectory for each subensemble. Thus the
nested subensemble method determines a set of trajecto-
ries X(t; S2) and a weighting factor for each one. Then,
the statistical properties of the stochastic trajectory are
obtained by performing averages over these trajectories.
Except for some special case, the trajectories X(t; S2)
have to be numerically calculated by solving the Hamil-
tonian system (32). This procedure appears to be very
similar with a direct numerical study of the simulated
trajectories. There are however essential diﬀerences. The

average trajectories are obtained from a rather smooth
and simple time-independent Hamiltonian. They are pe-
riodic functions and thus are calculated only for a pe-
riod. The number of trajectories is much smaller than
in the numerical study due to the weighting factor deter-
mined analytically. This reduced very much the calcula-
tion time, such that it can be performed on PC. Moreover
such a calculation performed for a static stochastic po-
tential with a given EC determines the solution for the
time dependent potential with arbitrary time factor in
the EC (see Section VI B).

−

We have developed an algorithm for calculating the
statistical characteristics of the trajectories in subensem-
bles (S) and the running diﬀusion coeﬃcient (38) for
given EC of the potential. The trajectories are calculated
for a period using a variable integration step determined
monitored by the precision obtained for the potential.
Values of this precision of 10−3
10−4 ensure the stability
of the calculated D(t). The order of performing the in-
tegrals in Eq.(38) appears to be important. The integral
over u is ﬁrst calculated. This parameter is factorized in
the expression of the average Eulerian potential in (S2)
(28) such that it appears as a factor in the right hand
side of Eq.(32). This factor is introduced in the time
variable and so only the trajectories with u = 1 need
to be calculated. The values of the function X1(ut; S2)
are determined by interpolation and using the periodic-
ity. the range of u is determined from the range of the
exponential factor and the step du is determined at each
integration such that a large enough number of points
(30-50) exists on each period. When there are more than
about 50 periods on the range of u the integration is not
performed because its value is negligible. The next in-
tegrations are over φ0
12. The integrand for
each of these integrals is over the range determined by
the exponential factor and we have calculated it on a
mesh with constant step with 31-61 points. The last is
performed the integral over φ0. Due to trajectory trap-
ping, the range of this integral is continuously reduced
as time increases (φ0
). The range
of this integral is calculated as a function of time for
the interval of calculation of D(t). The calculations start
with a large value of φ0
max, as obtained from the expo-
nential factor. At the time when the integrand becomes
approximately zero on half of this range φ0
max is reduced
and the integration of the trajectories is taken again from
t = 0 for the new values of φ0. The mesh for φ0′ has vari-
able steps that increase toward large values of φ0 because
the function has strong variations at small φ0. The tests
performed with this code have shown that the numerical
calculations are rather fast and accurate and they can be
advanced up to large values of time. For instance, using
the decorrelation trajectory method the duration of the
calculation of D(t) up to time of the order 10ˆ2 is of the
order of 10 seconds on an usual PC. Using the nested
subensemble method the calculation time is of the order

of one day because the number of calculated trajectories
increases with a factor 104.

The nested subensemble method determines the LVC
for test particles moving in a stochastic potential with
given EC. The main condition for using this method
is that the transport is stationary, which usually cor-
responds to stationary and homogeneous stochastic po-
tentials. The potential ﬁeld is Gaussian. The time-
dependent diﬀusion coeﬃcient (38) corresponds to an
isotropic potential but this is not a restriction for this
method. The above calculation are for a static potential
but they can be extended to time dependent case (see
Section VI B and [14]).

V. TRAJECTORY STRUCTURES

We present in this Section typical results obtained
for the statistical characteristics of the trajectories in a
subensemble (S2). We need to specify the EC of the
stochastic potential, which we choose as

E(x) =

1
1 + x2

2)/2

.

1 + (x2

(40)

This is the EC of a normalized stochastic potential with
amplitude E(0) = 1, λc = 1 and the time with τf l = 1.
The velocity v0 that deﬁnes the subensembles (S) is taken
along the x1 axis.

φ0

The average trajectory in the subensembles (S2), solu-
tion of Eq.(32), is a periodic function of time and evolves
on a closed path for most of the subensembles (S2).
There are also some open paths for subensembles with
φ0 = 0 and trajectories with very large periods for small
values of
. Some examples of paths of the average
trajectories in (S2) are presented in Fig. 1. There is a
clear diﬀerence between the trajectories corresponding to
small
(Fig. 1b for
φ0 = 1). In the ﬁrst case there are open trajectories, large
displacements and large periods for the closed paths. In
the second case the trajectories have small size and their
periods are much smaller. The size of the path and the
period of the trajectory depend on the six parameters
that deﬁne the nested subensembles (S), (S2).

subensemble (S) are presented in Fig. 2. The time depen-
dence of X(t; S) is presented in Fig. 3. These trajectories
are not periodic. They evolve on spiral shaped paths, ex-
cept for the subensemble with φ0 = 0 which yields a
continuous displacement along v0. The size of the paths

(S). It increases when
paths) and when φ0
0 it becomes inﬁnite. Thus the
average trajectories in (S) obtained here are completely
diﬀerent from those obtained by means of the decorrela-
tion trajectory method [14]. The later are periodic func-
tions of time and their paths are closed (see Fig. 2 for
comparison). This means that the ﬂuctuations of the tra-
jectories have a strong inﬂuence on the average trajectory
in (S). They determine the time-saturation of the aver-
age trajectory in (S) by the mixing of the closed periodic
trajectories.

The dispersion of the trajectories in the subensemble
(S) obtained from Eq. (35) is presented in Fig. 3 as a
function of time for φ0 = 0 (Fig. 3a) and φ0 = 1 (Fig.
3b). One can see that in the ﬁrst case the dispersion con-
tinuously increases (Fig. 3a) while in the second case it
saturates after a more complicated evolution (Fig. 3b).
The saturation time is the same as for the average tra-
jectory. The amplitude of the trajectory ﬂuctuations is
comparable with the average displacement.

The trajectories in the subensemble (S) are Gaussian
τf l but their distribution is strongly
at small time t
modiﬁed as time increases. The pdf obtained from Eq.
(36) is represented in Fig. 4. Important diﬀerences can
be observed between the subensembles with φ0
∼= 0 (Fig.
φ0
(Fig. 4b). In the ﬁrst case
4a) and those with large
the pdf is symmetric around v0, it develops a narrow
(cid:12)
maximum in x = 0 and an annulus that expands contin-
(cid:12)
uously in the direction of v0 as time increases (Fig. 4a).
The velocity of this part of trajectories is larger than the
average velocity. The path of the average displacement is
also represented in Fig. 4a. The end point of this curve
is the average position at the moment corresponding to
the representation of the pdf (t = 100τf l). It is located
between the two maxima of the pdf in a region where the
later is practically zero. The pdf for subensembles with
large
is completely diﬀerent. It saturates in a time τs
at a function that has a narrow maximum in x = 0 and
extends only on a small region (with x2 > 0 for φ0 > 0).
Thus the statistical characteristics of the trajectories
in a subensemble (S) with a large values of
are com-
pletely diﬀerent of those corresponding to subensembles
with φ0
∼= 0. The average, the dispersion and the pdf
of these trajectories saturate. This shows that there is
a quasi-coherent motion in such subensembles consist-
ing in trajectory rotation on closed paths, with localized
pdf and small saturated dispersion. The trajectories form
structures similar with ﬂuid vortices. These structures or
eddying regions are permanent in static stochastic poten-
tials. The saturation time τs represents the average time
necessary for the formation of the structure. The aver-
age size of the structure is represented by the asymptotic
average displacement
τs. The disper-
sion of the trajectories in the structure is given by the

these trajectories showing that they form structures. On
the contrary, the clump eﬀect is very weak (practically

in Fig. 5a,

calized around zero and saturates (Fig. 6b). In the case

the absence of trapping the clump eﬀect appears as an
exponential time dependence of the average square dis-
tance between two trajectories, of the type
=
δ2
0 exp(t/τcl), where the clump characteristic time τcl is
of the order of the diﬀusion time which is the ﬂight time
τf l at large K (see [28] and the references therein or the
review paper [4]). The distance between two neighbor-
ing trajectories remains close to the initial value during
a time τcl and then
grows rapidly and reaches
a diﬀusive behavior with the diﬀusion coeﬃcient equal
(cid:11)
to 2D. The process of trajectory trapping determines a
complete change of the clump eﬀect. It appears only for
a part of the trajectories, those contained in subensem-
bles (S) with large
, and is very strong. The life time
of the clump is much larger than τf l and than the satu-
ration time τs. The time evolution of the relative square
displacement is much slower. Neighboring particles have
thus a coherent motion for a long time. For the other
part of the trajectories, those that move along contour

VI. TRANSPORT

A. Static stochastic potential

≡

The Lagrangian velocity correlation and the time de-
pendent diﬀusion coeﬃcient for the whole ensemble of
trajectories are determined from Eq.
(38). The in-
tegral over the parameters of the subensembles (S) of
the average displacement in (S) has to be calculated.
Since X1(t; S) decays to zero in a time τs(S), the tra-
jectory structures have only a transient contribution to
the running diﬀusion coeﬃcient. At times larger that
τs(S) the contribution of the subensemble (S) vanishes.
As time increases the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D(t) is deter-
mined by a smaller and smaller number of trajectories,
those contained in large structures with large saturation
time. The results obtained for D(t) are presented in
Fig. 7 where the dimensionless function F (t)
D(t)/DB
is plotted (continuous line). The transport is subdiﬀu-
sive in such static stochastic potential. One can observe
the change that appears at t & τf l. The running diﬀu-
sion coeﬃcient begins to decrease and eventually goes
to zero. A power law decay was obtained at t > τf l as
−0.43. The LVC becomes negative
D(t) = V λc (t/τf l)
at this time and after a minimum it has a long negative
algebraic tail that decays to zero. The positive and the
negative parts of L(t) have equal time integral such that
t
0. The mean square displacement is
0 L(τ )dτ = D(t)
x2(t)
R
The result obtained for D(t) with the decorrelation tra-
(cid:10)
jectory method is also plotted in Fig. 7 (dashed line). It
is surprisingly close to the result of the nested subensem-
ble method although the two methods yield completely
diﬀerent average trajectories in the subensembles (S)
(Fig. 2). This shows that by introducing the subensem-
bles (S2) in the nested subensemble method a strong
qualitative improvement of the statistical results in the
next upper subensemble (S) is obtained and only a small
correction at the level of the whole set of realizations.
It is thus expected that the development of the method
by introducing higher order derivatives and the corre-
sponding nested subensembles (S3), (S4), ...would yield
only small corrections for the physically interesting re-
sults that concern the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D(t) and the
statistical properties of the trajectory structures. This
nested subensemble method appears to be fast conver-
gent. This is a consequence of the fact that the mixing
of periodic trajectories, which characterizes this nonlin-
ear stochastic process, is directly described at each order
of our approach. The results obtained in ﬁrst order (the

t0.57 and thus the process is subdiﬀusive.

decorrelation trajectory method) for D(t) are thus vali-
dated by the present second order calculations.

B. Time-dependent stochastic potential

For a time-dependent potential φ(x, t) (ﬁnite τc and
K), it is also possible to apply the nested subensemble
method following the same procedure as above. A very
simple analytical solution is obtained when the stochastic
potential has independent time and space variations such
that its EC is E(x)h(t). In this case, the average Eulerian
potential in the subensemble (S) is given by Eq.(28) mul-
tiplied with the factor h(t). This factor is transmitted to
the average Eulerian velocity in (S) (29) and it appears
in the equation (32) for the average trajectory in (S2). A
change of variable from t to

θ(t) =

h(τ )dτ

(41)

t

0
Z

can be performed in Eq.(32) and thus the average tra-
jectory in (S2) for a time dependent potential can be
written in terms of the average trajectory for the static
case as X(θ(t); S2). The argument θ(t) determined by
the time-dependence of the potential is θ(t) ∼= t at small
t and saturates at a constant which is the decorrelation
time θ(t)
τc. The same expression (38) is eventually
obtained for the time dependent diﬀusion coeﬃcient but
with X1(t; S) replaced by X1(θ(t); S) and thus the diﬀu-
sion coeﬃcient is

→

Dtd(t) = D [θ(t)] .

(42)

The limit for t
is ﬁnite which shows that the trans-
port is diﬀusive in a time dependent stochastic potential
and the diﬀusion coeﬃcient is

→ ∞

Dtd = D(τc) = DBF (τc).

(43)

This equation shows that the asymptotic diﬀusion coef-
ﬁcient is determined by the time dependent diﬀusion co-
eﬃcient D(t) corresponding to the static potential (F (t)
is the function plotted in Fig.7 and represents the nor-
malized diﬀusion coeﬃcient in the static potential and
DB = (λ2
c /τc)K = V λc is the Bohm diﬀusion coeﬃcient
obtained when trajectory trapping is neglected). In the
limit of small K, the quasilinear result is recovered from
Eq.(43) and, at large K, Dtd is reduced compared to the
Bohm diﬀusion coeﬃcient by a factor F (K) < 1 which
accounts for trajectory trapping. For the above EC of the
potential, Eq.(43) gives the large K scaling law Dtd
(
λ2
c/τc)K γ with γ = 0.57. The exponent γ depends on the
EC of the potential, namely on its space dependence at
large distances. It is not a ﬁxed value as in the estima-
tion based on percolation theory [13]. A detailed study
of the eﬀect of the EC of the potential on the scaling of
the diﬀusion coeﬃcient is in progress.

≈

Thus, the study of the static case permits to deter-
mine the asymptotic diﬀusion coeﬃcient in a time de-
pendent stochastic potential. This property appears in
the results of the nested subensemble method (and in
the decorrelation trajectory method) but it is possible to
demonstrate in general that the time dependence of the
diﬀusion coeﬃcient in the subdiﬀusive static case deter-
mines the Kubo number dependence of the asymptotic
diﬀusion coeﬃcient in a time dependent potential. The
subdiﬀusive transport corresponds to Lagrangian corre-
lations L(t) which have the property:

D(t) =

L(t)dt

0.

→

t

0
Z

(44)

≈
≈

This shows that such a correlation has negative parts
that compensate the small time correlation which is al-
ways positive. We suppose that D(t) decays to zero as
−α and consequently the LVC behaves as
D(t)
(t/τf l)
(t/τf l)−α−1. In the time-dependent case, the vari-
L(t)
ation of the stochastic ﬁeld produces the decorrelation of
the Lagrangian velocity and consequently the Lagrangian
correlation decays to zero at t ' τc. The asymptotic dif-
fusion coeﬃcient can be evaluated as
τc

D =

L(t)dt

L(t)dt

and using Eq. (44) one can write

0

≈

(τc/τf l)

−α.

Thus the exponent α of the time decay of the subdiﬀusive
transport coeﬃcient in the static case determines the ex-
ponent of the K dependence of the asymptotic diﬀusion
coeﬃcient in the time-dependent case. This means that
Eq.(43) holds even if the evolution of Dtd(t) is not given
by Eq.(42) as happens for example when the EC of the
potential is not factorized.

The time variation of the potential determines a decor-
relation eﬀect. After a time of the order τc the conﬁg-
uration of the stochastic potential changes. A competi-
tion appears between the intrinsic tendency of the tra-
jectories to form structures and the destruction of these
structures produced by the time variation of the poten-
tial ﬁeld. Structures with τs(S) & τc cannot exist and the
corresponding trajectories produce a diﬀusive transport.
Small structures that build up rapidly (with τs(S)
τc)
still exist if the correlation time of the ﬁeld is longer than
the ﬂight time (τc > τf l, K > 1). These vortical struc-
tures do not contribute to the large time values of the
diﬀusion coeﬃcient and the transport is reduced.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

We have studied the special problem of test parti-
cle transport in 2-dimensional divergence-free stochas-

11

tic velocity ﬁelds, which is characterized by the intrin-
sic trapping of the trajectories on the contour line of
the stochastic potential. We have developed a semi-
analytical statistical approach, the nested subensemble
method. The time dependent diﬀusion coeﬃcient is de-
termined by means of a set of deterministic trajectories,
the average trajectories in subensembles with given val-
ues of the potential and of the velocity in their starting
point. These trajectories are obtained by dividing each
subensemble in a class of subensembles deﬁned by the
values of the second derivatives of the potential. Thus,
the nested subensemble approach reduces the problem of
determining the statistical behavior of the stochastic tra-
jectories to the calculation of weighted averages of some
smooth, deterministic trajectories determined from the
EC of the stochastic potential.

The statistical characteristics of subensembles of tra-
jectories are obtained with this method. We have shown
that the statistical behavior of the trapped trajectories
is completely diﬀerent from that of the free trajectories.
The trapped trajectories have a quasi-coherent behavior.
Their average displacement, dispersion and probability
distribution function saturate. A very strong anomalous
clump eﬀect characterizes neighboring trapped trajecto-
ries. Their clump life time is very large compared to the
time of ﬂight. This shows that these trajectories form
structures similar with ﬂuid vortices. The statistical pa-
rameters of these structures (size, build-up time, disper-
sion) are determined. The trajectories contained in such
structures do not contribute to the large time diﬀusion
coeﬃcient. The later is determined by the free trajec-
tories which have a continuously growing average dis-
placement and dispersion. The probability distribution
function for both types of trajectories are non-Gaussian.
The time dependent diﬀusion coeﬃcient is determined
as a functional of the Eulerian correlation of the stochas-
tic potential.

The general conclusion of this work is that the exis-
tence of an invariant in the evolution equation (the poten-
tial) determines long-time correlations (memory eﬀects)
and coherence (trajectory structures) in the stochastic
motion.

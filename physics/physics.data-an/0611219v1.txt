Notes on statistical separation of classes of
events

Introduction

A common problem is that of separating diﬀerent classes of events in a given
sample. One may want to separate some ”signal” from one or more ”back-
ground” sources, or simply distinguish between diﬀerent classes of signal
events. There are several instances where one cannot or does not wish to
separate by means of cutting, and instead wants to do a statistical separa-
tion. This means to be able to calculate the number of events in each category
that are present in the given sample, and maybe measure some other char-
acteristics of each class, without explicitly labeling each individual event as
belonging to a particular category. For this to be possible, one needs some
observables that have diﬀerent distributions for each class of events.

The purpose of this note is to deﬁne some criteria for quantifying the
resolution achievable in statistical separation, given the distributions of the
observables used to this purpose. One can use this to:

• quote the separation power of an observable in a compact way

• quickly evaluate the expected resolution on extracting the fractions of

events in each category before actually performing any ﬁt

• decide the optimal variables to use in separation when there are several

choices

Separating contributions

Suppose your sample contains n diﬀerent classes of events, each contribut-
ing a fraction fi of the total, and let x be some observable (which may be
multidimensional) that is supposed to distinguish between those events. The
probability distribution of x for our sample will be:

ptot(x|f ) =

fipi(x)

(1)

i=1,n
X
where pi(x) is the pdf of x for events of type i, and it is assumed here to be
perfectly known (any uncertainty in the pi(x) would contribute a systematic
uncertainty to the ﬁnal results).

The most basic informations one wishes to extract from the sample of
data at hand is the values of the fractions fi; we can therefore take the
resolution in extracting the fi’s as the measure of the separating power of
the observable x.

The sum of all fi must be 1 in order for the overall distribution to be
correctly normalized, so there are actually only n − 1 free parameters to be
evaluated; let’s put arbitrarily fn = 1 −

i=1,n−1 fi.

P

The resolution in estimating the fi’s can in principle be measured by
setting up a Maximum Likelihood ﬁt procedure, and repeating it on a suﬃ-
cient number of MonteCarlo samples to evaluate the spread of results around
the input values. You can also look at the resolutions returned by your fa-
vorite ﬁtter program, but it is important to remember that those numbers
are only approximate estimates of the actual resolution achieved, especially
when statistics is low and/or the likelihood function is less than regular, so
it is useful to be able to calculate them indipendently. This is also a good
cross–check that the ﬁt is actually doing what you want and that its error
estimates are sound.

A standard way to evaluate the resolution expected from a measurement
before actually carrying it out is to look at the Minimum Variance Bound[1]:

cov( ˆµi, ˆµj) = −

−1

∂2log L
∂µi∂µj ##
ij

E

"

(2)

this is an upper bound to the precision that can be achieved, whatever
the estimation procedure used. Whenever the problem is suﬃciently regular,

2

the ML estimator gets in fact very close to this limit.

Luckily enough, the MVB for our problem can be written down in a pretty
simple form: the covariance matrix of the n − 1 independent fi parameter
estimates is:

cov(fi, fj) =

1
N "Z

(pi(x) − pn(x)) (pj(x) − pn(x))
ptot(x|f )

−1

dx
#

ij

(3)

(remember that the fraction fn associated to distribution pn(x) is deter-
mined from the other fi’s). Note that in this formula the symbol x may
stand for a set of many variables, discrete and/or continuous, and the inte-
grals extend over the whole x domain.

For a 2–component sample, there is only one fraction f = f1 to be eval-

uated, and the result is particulary simple:

σ2(f ) =

1
N  Z

(p1(x) − p2(x))
f p1(x) + (1 − f )p2(x)

dx

!

−1

This is the quantity you want to minimize in order to achieve the best

possible statistical separation.

In the limiting case of the diﬀerent classes of events being totally sep-
arated in x, that is, the pi(x) having zero overlap, the uncertainties on fi
come just from the statistical ﬂuctuations of the distribution of the events
amongst classes due to ﬁnite sample size, and eq. 4 becomes:

σ2
best(f ) =

f (1 − f )
N

which is the familiar result from the Binomial distribution.
It is particularly convenient to use the ratio of the resolution (4) to the
limit resolution (5), in order to quote the separation power of the observable
x as an adimensional quantity:

s = σbest(f )/σ(f ) = v
u
u
t

f (1 − f )

Z

(p1(x) − p2(x))
ptot(x|f )

dx

This is indipendent from the sample size N, and tells you at a glance the
power of the x observable in separating the samples, from 0 (no separation)
to 1 (absolute maximum achievable with the given sample). This quantity

is more informative than common expressions like ”n-sigma separation” or
”curves overlap by xxx%”, as it tells you exactly how good the observable
x is in separating the events, and it is valid whatever the shape and the
dimensionality of the distributions involved.

Examples

A simple and common example is the separation between two 1-dimensional
gaussian distributions of same sigma. The above quantity s is easily evaluated
by numerical integration. Note that s, as it generally happens for resolutions,
depends on the true value of the fractions fi. Figure 1 shows s as a function of
the distance, in units of sigma, between the mean values of the two gaussians,
and the diﬀerent curves are for diﬀerent values of f . From this graph you
can read, for instance, that a separation of 1 sigma between roughly equally
populated samples gives you a resolution on the relative fractions slightly
more than a factor of two (1/0.45) worse than ideal, that is to say, the
sample is statistically equivalent to a fully separated sample of size smaller
by a factor 0.2 = 0.452.

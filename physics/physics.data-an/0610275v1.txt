We introduce an infectious default and recovery model for N obligors. Obligors are assumed

to be exchangeable and their states are described by N Bernoulli random variables Si(i =
, N ). They are expressed by multiplying independent Bernoulli variables Xi, Yij, Y ′
ij ,
1,
and default and recovery infections are described by Yij and Y ′
ij . We obtain the default
probability function P (k) for k defaults. Taking its continuous limit, we ﬁnd two nontrivial

Introduction

The cooperative phenomena, especially phase transitions have been extensively studied

and they still remain to be important subjects up to now. They have provided universal

paradigm for physics, sociology and economy. The economical systems composed of a large
number of interacting units have been studied from the viewpoint.1, 2 Recently, systemic fail-
ure problems are hot topics in econophysics,3–6 ﬁnancial engineering7–11 and computer en-
gineering12 and many probabilistic models have been proposed. One motivation is that the

description of systemic failures is necessary to control and manage them. Other motivation is
that credit risk markets are now growing and pricing the products are urgent problems.13 For

the purpose, it is necessary to propose probabilistic models to describe credit risks.

The diﬃculty in the description of systemic failures comes from that they are not indepen-

dent events. If they are independent, the description is very easy and we only need Bernoulli

type random variables Si describing the element i’s failure or not by Si = 1 or Si = 0. How-

ever, there are much phenomena where the “correlation” between the failure events are very

important. For example, in the network of storage systems, in the case of a failure of a node,

it can propagate to other nodes.

In credit risk markets, the same kind of risk propagation does occur. A percolation type

probabilistic model was proposed to describe bank bankruptcies, where interbank deposits

lead to collective credit risks. The probability of l failures showed the power law P (l)

with the Fisher exponent τ at its critical point. In the paper,7 a default infection mechanism

was proposed to describe the risk dependency structures. The constituents are obligors and

risk is whether he (or she) can refund at the expiry. Such a risk is called default risk. Davis

and Lo introduced independent Bernoulli random variables Yij which describes the infection

from bad obligor j to good one i. They obtained the probability function for k defaults P (k)

explicitly. They estimated the eﬀect of default correlation on P (k).

One of the crucial problems of these studies is that whether or not their P (k)s do describe

the empirical default distribution P (k) is not clear. Because of the relative scarcity of good

data on credit events, it was impossible to compare the models with the empirical data.

Recently, from the market quotes on credit risk products, it becomes possible to infer the
default distribution function.11, 14 We are able to compare and calibrate probabilistic models.

In the present paper, we generalize the model of Davis and Lo by introducing a recovery eﬀect.

We compare the default distribution P (k) with a credit market’s implied one and calibrate

the model parameters. About the bulk shape, we see that the calibrated P (k) looks similar.

The outline of the present paper is as follows. Section 2 gives a brief introduction to
the infectious default model of Davis and Lo7 and we modify it by introducing a recovery

process. We obtain the default probability function P (k) for k defaults. In section 3, we take

the continuous limit of P (k) with ﬁnite Pd and non-zero correlation ρ > 0. We ﬁnd two non-
trivial probability distribution functions with a reﬂection symmetry. They show oscillating

behaviors and we understand the mechanism. We compare the model distribution function

P (k) with a market implied one in section 4. Section 5 summarizes our results and future

problems are discussed.

Infectious Default Model

We consider N exchangeable obligors whose states are described by random variables

· · ·

Si(i = 1, 2,

, N ) such that Si = 1 if obligor i defaults and Si = 0 otherwise. Here, the term

“exchangeable” means the non-dependency of the joint probabilities P (S1, S2,

Here, Xi is the internal state variable which describes whether the obligor is in good state

(Xi = 0) or not (Xi=1). Si is also the state variable, which describes whether the obligor is

defaulted (Si = 1) or not (Si = 0). It is determined by not only the internal state but also

by the external environment. If Xi = 1, Si takes 1 and the obligor default. Even if Xi takes

0, the obligor i can default. Yij represents the inﬂuence from other bad obligor (Xj = 1) to

obligor i. A default infection from bad obligor j takes place if Yij = 1 and Xj = 1. Si becomes

1 and the obligor defaults. The second term of eq.(2.3) represents the eﬀect.

We introduce a supporting eﬀect from other good obligors in addition to the default

infection. In fact, it may occur that a good obligor support other bad obligors and the latter

can circumvent their defaults. We introduce new independent Bernoulli random variables Y ′ij

Eq.(2.5) means that even when Xi takes 1, if Xj takes 0 and Y ′ij takes 1, obligor i is supported
by obligor j and avoids its default. We note that eq.(2.5) has a default, non-default symmetry.

particular, for large N , there are three solutions. For example, there are three solutions p =

0.808310, 0.5, 0.191680 for N = 100, Pd = 0.5, and q = q′ = 0.05, on the other hand, there is

only one solution p = 0.5 for N = 50, Pd = 0.5, and q = q′ = 0.05. The reason is that for
= 0, Pd behaves as in Fig.2. Pd(p, q, q′) starts from 0 at p = 0 to 1 at p = 1.
arbitrary q, q′ 6
For the intermediate value of p, Pd rapidly increases to 1 and then decreases to 0 near p = 1
in the large N limit. Afterwords Pd goes to 1 toward p = 1 rapidly. Such a behavior can be

explained with eq.(2.9). There are three p solutions corresponding to a Pd value and we call
them the left, middle and right solutions according to the order of p. The parameter region

(q, q′) where there are three solutions of p expands with N and in the N

limit, it covers

→ ∞

the whole parameter space (q > 0, q′ > 0).

We show the proﬁles of the three solutions in Fig.3. We set N = 50, Pd = 0.5 and q =

q′ = 0.2. The three solutions are realized at p = 0.079281 (left), p = 0.5 (middle) and

p = 0.920719(right). The probability distribution function for the left solution and that for

the right solution have reﬂection symmetric proﬁles. The origin of the symmetry comes from

the reﬂection symmetry of eq.(2.5). P (k) for the middle solution p = 0.5 has a symmetrical

proﬁle and is almost the binomial distribution Bi(50, 0.5).

3. Continuous Limit and probability distribution function

In this section, we would like to take the continuous limit of eq.(2.7). It is required to

take the limit N

with non-zero correlation because probability distribution function of

uncorrelated variables is the binomial distribution. Its continuous limit reduces to a trivial

→ ∞

delta function. We need to take the continuous limit with ﬁxed Pd and ρ. Writing explicitly,

Pini(n) is the probability that there occurs n internal bad obligors and it is the Poisson

probability function. p(x

n) is the resulting probability density after n bad companies appear

and infections occur from them. By the decomposition eq.(3.14), it is easy to understand the

oscillating behavior of p(x). See Fig.6, p(x) is clearly decomposed into the product of the

normal distribution p(x

n) and Pini(n).

We make a comment about De Finetti’s theorem which states that the joint probability

function of N exchangeable Bernoulli variables can be expressed by a mixture of the binomial
distribution function Bi(N, p) with some mixing function f (p).15–17 In the limit N

4. Comparison with implied default distribution

We compare our model with an implied distribution Pimp(k) which is inferred from the

market quotes of iTraxx-CJ (Series 2) on August 30, 2005. It describes the probability function

for k defaults of 50 Japanese companies and represents the credit market’s implications.

Pimp(k) that is estimated from the maximum entropy principle is depicted with dotted line in

Fig.7. It decreases rapidly for small k and then for 9

k

20 it is almost constant

0.1%.

Afterwards, Pimp(k) decays to zero rapidly. About the details of the inference process, please
see the article.10 Up to now, many probabilistic models have been proposed, they only give

poor ﬁts to the implied one. Here, we calibrate the model parameters p, q, q′ and study whether

or not our model ﬁts Pimp(k) well.

In the calibration, we equate the default probability Pd and default correlation ρ of the
model with those of the implied ones, Pd = 1.65% and ρ = 6.8%. There are three parameters

p, q, q′ in the model, we have only one degree of freedom. We study P (k) for the following 4

cases.

(1) Default infection only (left); q′ = 0.0, q = 0.054857 and p = 0.004512.

(2) Recovery infection only (right); q = 0.0, q′ = 0.421050 and p = 0.818175.

(3) Default infection with recovery (right); q = 0.001, q′ = 0.563790 and p = 0.847362.

(4) Default infection with recovery (right); q = 0.002, q′ = 0.723940 and p = 0.864563.

P (k) of the above four cases are shown in Fig.7. About the ﬁrst case, the model has only

the default infection mechanism (q′ = 0) and it is shown with a solid line. P (k) shows a sharp

valley structure at k = 1 and then decreases rapidly to zero at k

20. The proﬁle is clearly

diﬀerent from that of the implied one. On the other hand, the model with the right solution

q′ > q and p
proﬁles are smooth. They are depicted with symbols (cid:3)(q = 0.0),

(q = 0.001),

(cid:13)

△

Their proﬁles are closer to the implied one than that of the infection only case. As q increases,

the tail becomes short and fat. At q = 0.001 and q = 0.002 they look similar to the implied one.

We think that the infectious recovery is important to describe the implied default distribution

in the framework of infectious models.

P (k)s for the right solutions (case 2,3,4) have another peak at k = 50. The peak means

the probability that all 50 companies default simultaneously. The discrepancy from Pimp(k) is

not so serious, because the inference of the default distribution from market quotes depends

on the details of the optimization process. Instead of the entropy maximum principle, if we

use another method, the implied distribution might have a peak at k = 50.

The reason why the peak appears there in the infectious models is that we need to set
p large for the right solution. The probability that all 50 companies are bad is p50 and it is

non-zero. In the case, the recovery infection does not occur because of no good companies and

P (50) remains. On the other hand, the probability for k < 50 bad companies and 50
companies is Pint(k) = 50Ck ·
companies and the resulting default number is far less than k. Intuitively, probability Pint(k)

for k bad companies are dragged to the left and it changes to the probability P (k′) for k′ < k

defaults. As q increases, in order to ﬁx Pd and ρ, we need to increase p and q′. The peak at
k = 50 becomes higher and the dragging power to the left increases. As a result, P (k) moves

to the left.

About the case 1, where only default infection occurs, the distribution shifts to the right

in general. About k = 0 case where there are no bad companies, the probability (1

remains. The default infection does not occur and P (k) has a peak at k = 0.

5. Concluding remarks and future problems

We have generalized the infectious default model by incorporating an infectious recovery

eﬀect. We have obtained the default probability function P (k) for k defaults as a function

of model parameters p, q, q′ explicitly. We have taken the continuous limit and obtained the
probability density function p(x) for the default ratio x = k
N . We have understood the oscil-
lating behavior of p(x) by decomposing it as in eq.(3.14). p(x) is given as a superposition of

the occurrence of n bad obligors and the following default infection. The former follows the

Poisson distribution and the latter obeys the normal distribution. The normal distributions

have narrow peaks of width

, they appear in the oscillating behavior of p(x). We have

compared the P (k) with the implied one Pimp(k) inferred from the iTraxx-CJ quotes. By

calibrating model parameters, about the bulk shape, the proﬁles look similar. However, P (k)

∼

has a peak at k = 50. We give an intuitive reasoning about it. We note that, the principal

features of our model are solvability, ﬁtness for the implied distribution, and to be written as

a superposition of the Poisson distributions with only three parameters.

As future issues, we should study the time evolution of the model. One possibility is that

we prepare an initial conﬁguration of Si(t = 0) and time evolution of them are given as

Si(t + 1) = Si(t)Πj

=i(1

Y ′ij(t)(1

Sj(t))) + (1

Si(t))(1

=i(1

Yij(t)Sj(t))).

Yij(t) and Y ′ij(t) are independent Bernoulli variables at each time t and a conﬁguration of Sj(t)
is mapped to a new conﬁguration Si(t + 1). In the original problem, the binomial distribution

Bi(N, p) for Xi are transformed into a singular oscillating P (k). We can expect more dynamic

and complex behavior. Furthermore, in addition to the two-body interaction Yij, Y ′ij, three-
body or more many body interaction case might be interesting. Keeping the integrability of

the model, to what extent, such a generalization is possible. In the continuous limit, the model

with a continuous mixing function f (p) should be searched.

The model is on the complete graph. However the industry networks have been extensively
studied recently and it has been shown that they have complex structures.18, 19 The behavior

of the model on such realistic networks is of interest. In addition, the relation between this
model and the contact process20–22 should be clariﬁed. Despite the seeming similarity of our

model to the contact process, the infectious model proposes a new approach to the description

of infection. It may be that we can get the attribute of the contact process from infectious

models by taking some limit.

Applying any strategy requires some knowledge about the past state of the system. Unfortunately
in the case of economy collecting information is a diﬃcult, expensive and time consuming process.
Therefore the information about the system is known at the end of some well deﬁned intervals, e.
g. company reports, inﬂation data, GDP etc. They describe a (market) situation in the past. The
time delay is speciﬁc to the market branch. It can be very short (e.g. stock market oﬀer is updated
every minute or so and this information is immediately available) or long, like months in the case
of agricultural market, when the decisions are taken based on the results from the previous harvest.
The analysis of the information ﬂow delay can be based on the ACP model of spatial evolution of
economic systems [1]. The entities can move on a square lattice and when meeting take one of the
two following decisions: merge or create a new entity. The decision is based on the system state,
which is known with some time delay. The eﬀect of system’s feedback is investigated. We consider
the case of company distribution evolution in a heterogenous ﬁeld. The information ﬂow time delay
implies diﬀerent ﬁnal states, including cycles.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Economy system consists of companies which are working in some environment. All ﬁrms need some resources to
be able to perform their job. Besides typical resources such as energy, water or labour forces there is one which plays
a special role. This is the information about the system. This is one of the key points in an economy, because the
information about the system state – its state and actions of the competiting companies allows to build appropriate
strategies on the market [2, 3, 4]. On the other hand it is impossible to know the state of the system at once. Any of
economic index, e.g. Gross Domestic Product, inﬂation rate, ... is known with some time delay. Even in the case of
the stock market one knows only the last price, based on the bids from the last session, but one does not know the
bids on the present session. So even in this case the state of the system is not known. The problem is best seen in the
case of agriculture markets. Because farmers make theirs decisions based on the informations of the income of the last
harvest. It means that it might be a year time delay. It is well known that the agricultural market without control
and the more with control [5] is evolving as a periodic function. The typical mechanism is as follows. If there is a
great demand for a product, then the prices are high. This results in starting the production process, but usually to
many farmers have the same idea which results in great supply, which ﬁnally leads to price falling. Of course nobody
wants to loose money so farmers decide to change their product. Then supply fall and prices grow, repeating the
cycle. Therefore the delay of information ﬂow is one of the basic features of the economy system. This paper deals
with the problem of information ﬂow onto the evolution of the economy system.

The economy environment is modelled by adopting the ACP model [1, 6, 7]. The ACP model is altered by
introduction of the strategy depending on the state of the system. The inﬂuence of the information ﬂow delay onto
the behaviour of the system was investigated in the case of uniform distribution of companies in the system [8]. The
following step is to consider the case of a non uniform distribution of ﬁrms.

The paper is organised as follows: the short description of ACP model is presented in Sec.II, then the results of a
mean ﬁeld approximation are recalled in Sec.III. The results of heterogenous space evolution is presented in Sec.IV.

For the sake of clarity a short description of the main features of the ACP model is presented below. The model
was built to simulate the behaviour of economic system in changing conditions e.g. political changes or destruction

of economy barriers [1, 6, 7]. Originally the model was set in the form of a Monte Carlo simulation.

Economy entities are initially randomly placed on a square symmetry lattice. The environment is characterised by
a real ﬁeld F ∈ [0, 1] and a selection pressure sel. Each company is described by a real parameter f ∈ [0, 1] named
the ﬁtness.

There are three possible events in the system:

1. the company survive with the probability pi = exp(−sel|fi − F |)

2. then they move on the lattice (horizontally or vertically) one step at a time if a free space is available

3. if companies meet they can set a new ﬁrm or merge; the decision is taken through the strategy parameter b,
which is the probability of merging. Since the creation of company is a complementary event the settlement
probability is 1 − b.

The model was rewritten in the case of a mean ﬁeld approximation [9, 10] by introducing the company distribution
function N (t, f ), which is the number of ﬁrms with ﬁtness f at time t. Then the system was characterized by the
concentration of companies c(t) and investigated in the case of the best adapted companies f = F [9].

The ACP model was investigated by Monte Carlo simulations in order to describe the adaptation process to new
conditions [1, 6, 7]. Since the results show that usually the most adapted ones survive the best adapted case was
investigated in order to ﬁnd out stability conditions of the system [9].

III. THE INFORMATION TRANSFER IN A UNIFORMLY OCCUPIED SPACE

The information transfer delay was investigated by the introduction of an investment strategy depending on the
state of the system the system. The constant probability of company creation was replaced by b → (1 − c), where c
was the concentration updated every n-th iteration step. The evolution of the system was governed by the following
equation:

ct = ct−1 +

ct−1(1 − c8

t−1)(1 − (1 − ct−1)8)(2ST (c(g(t))) − 1),

where ST (c) = 1 − c, g(t) = k[ t
given in the brackets. The time is measured in iteration steps IS. It has been shown [8] that for

k ] and [ ] denotes the procedure of taking a natural number not larger than the one

• short time delay, td ∈ [2, 4]:

The system evolves to a stable state of concentration c = 0.5. The stability time (ts) deﬁned as the time required
by the system to achieve a stable state increases with the time delay from about ts ≈ 20 IS for td ≈ 2 IS,
ts = 100 IS for td = 3 IS and ts ≈ 4200 IS for td = 3 IS.

• medium time delay, td = 5 IS or td = 6 IS:

Due to the time delay cycles become visible in the system. For td = 5 IS the system evolves between six states.

• long time delay, td ≥ 7 IS:

For the td = 7 IS crashes appear in the system. A crash of the system is recognised if the concentration of
companies goes below zero. However for a time delay longer than 7 IS the system does not have to crash.
Even in the case of very long time delay (12 IS or 15 IS) and for some initial values of the concentration (e.g.
c0 = 0.041) the crash time is very long (above 400 IS). Additionally it has been observed that in the case of
td = 15 IS for same initial concentration (e.g. c0 = 0.021) the system was able to reach the stable fully occupied
state (c = 1).

IV. THE INFORMATION TRANSFER A NON-UNIFORMLY OCCUPIED SPACE

After the analysis of the behaviour of a uniform distribution of companies let us consider the problem of a

heterogeneous distribution of companies. The system is deﬁned as follows:

• the space is a square symmetry lattice

• the lattice consists of subspaces described by a uniform density of ﬁrms

• the companies may:

– stay at their subspace
– jump to another lattice subspace
– after moving (or staying) the company may create a new one or merge with another

Strategy constraints:

jump decision)

• the length of the jump depends on the company strategy J and the concentration of ﬁrms in the considered

lattice point (higher concentration – longer jump)

• the decision upon creation or annihilation depends on the concentration of companies in a new place (after the

• the information time delay inﬂuences only the decision about company creation

It is assumed that the company should know the situation in its closest neighbourhood so that the decision about
jump length is taken on the real data, but the creation decision depends on a global situation on the system based
on the information published by the system. However the system updates the information every td IS, whence the
decision is taken based on the information which can be as old as td IS.

Evolution of the system is described by the following set of equations for the increase (decrease) of concentration
at point (x, y) at the given time t under a delay td. The eight possible directions of jumps are considered and the
case when no jumps occure ∆ci(xj, yk)(t), i = 1...9, j, k = 0, 1, 2.

∆c1(x, y)(t) ≡ c(x, y)(t − 1){(1 − c(x, y)(t − 1)) · (1 − c(x, y)(td)) · (1 − c8(x, y)(t)) −

where:

c(td) is the recently updated information about the system,
x1 = x + J · c(x, y), x2 = x − J · c(x, y), y1 = y + J · c(x, y), y2 = y − J · c(x, y), the concentration is measured at the
time indicated in Eqs. (3 - 10).

The new state of the system is calculated summing inputs from Eqs.(2-10), i.e.,

c(x, y)(t) = c(x, y)(t − 1) +

If the concentration of companies is smaller than zero it is recognised as a local crash of the system and the
concentration is reset to zero. Unlike in the previously analysed system [8] it is obvious that the system will remain
in a zero state. Due to the jumps it is possible that the place will be taken by another company later.

V. BEHAVIOUR OF THE SYSTEM

A. Time delay inﬂuence

Examples of the system evolution are presented in Figs.1-4. The simulation parameters are as follows: the size of
the square lattice 100 × 100. The jump length J = 4, the time delay td varies from 1 to 12. Initially the lattice was
occupied in the middle x ∈ (45, 55), y ∈ (45, 55). The value of the initial concentration was chosen randomly from
the interval (0, 1).

For the case with no delay in the information ﬂow the system evolves toward a stable state with concentration
c = 0.5 at every lattice point. This is similar to the case discussed in the uniformly occupied system (Sec.III),
where the system evolved to the stable state in the case of short time delay of the information ﬂow. However in the
heterogeneous system the oscillatory behaviour becomes visible even for very short td. For td = 2 IS the Fourier
transform of the total concentration presented in Fig.5 has a peak at t = 75 IS. The same is for td = 4 IS,
but the maximum is signiﬁcantly higher.
It is in agreement with the evolution of the system presented in Fig.2,
where oscillations of the total concentration can be seen. If the time delay is longer than 4 IS the periodic behaviour
becomes more complicated; the Fourier transform (Fig.5) showas two distinct maxima. The complexity of the periodic
behaviour increases with the value of the time delay of information ﬂow. For td = 8 IS there are three strong maxima
and for td = 10 IS – ten maxima.

In the case of an inital random concentration the inﬂuence of the jump length parameter has been investigated.
The evolution of the system has been investigated in the case J = 10, which is a signiﬁcant number as compared with
the lattice size. Only the speed of inhibiting the system was increased. Other results as the periodic behaviour or the
stabilisation level did not change signiﬁcantly.

B. Jump length inﬂuence

VI. CONCLUSIONS

The causes of economic cycles and their properties are fascinating problems of the economy [11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18]. In the present investigations it has been shown that an ability to move may prevent the system from a
total crash. In contrast to the uniformly occupied system analysed in [8] even in the case of very long time delay
of information ﬂow the systems do not crash. On the other hand for td > 4 the system evolution reveals periodic
behaviours. This may suggest that the information ﬂow plays one of the key factors in economic cycle generations.
It is worth to notice that the td = 4 IS causes periodic behaviour of 75 IS. Applying the same proportion to the real
systems the quarterly updated data may result in 5-6 year cycle. Of course the investigated model is highly far from
the complexity of the economy system, but the importance of the information ﬂow in economy systems is hereby well
demonstrated.

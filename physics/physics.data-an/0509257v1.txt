Small scale behavior of ﬁnancial data

(Dated: September 28, 2013)

A new approach is presented to describe the change in the statistics of the log return distribution
of ﬁnancial data as a function of the timescale. To this purpose a measure is introduced, which
quantiﬁes the distance of a considered distribution to a reference distribution. The existence of a
small timescale regime is demonstrated, which exhibits diﬀerent properties compared to the normal
timescale regime. This regime seems to be universal for individual stocks.
It is shown that the
existence of this small timescale regime is not dependent on the special choice of the distance
measure or the reference distribution. These ﬁndings have important implications for risk analysis,
in particular for the probability of extreme events.

INTRODUCTION

The origin of mathematical ﬁnance dates back to
Bachelier’s famous thesis Th´eorie De La Sp´eculation (see
[1]). As a central point in this work a normal distribu-
tion was assumed for ﬁnancial returns. This assumption
was for several reasons later changed by other authors to
a normal distribution for the log return r [2]. The log
return r is deﬁned in the following way:

r(τ ) := log(P (t + τ )) − log(P (t))

(1)

where P (t) denotes the price of the investment at time
t. For further alternative analytic distributions we re-
fer to [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Other attempts [8] focused more
on the mechanism that may produce such distributions.
Several candidates have been proposed that provide a
good approximation to the real distribution [9]. There
remains a general problem to determine the correct fam-
ily of distributions, based on an appropriate underlying
stochastic process. This problem becomes particularly
diﬃcult if changing shapes of the distribution with the
timescale are considered.

In the following we focus on the distribution (or the so
called probability density functions - pdf) of log returns
for ﬁxed timescale τ . This pdf is in general dependent
on the value of the log return itself as well as on the
considered timescale. The question of the dependence of
the shape of the distribution on the time scale was al-
ready posed in [2]. Considering changes of the form of
distributions one has to distinguish between changes due
to the mean value, due to the standard deviation and
due to the shape. The dependence of the mean and the
standard deviation on the timescale was analyzed exten-
sively in diﬀerent publications dealing mainly with the
scaling behavior of ﬁnancial data, see e.g. [10]. A com-
mon approach is to assume that the normalized shape
of the distribution is independent of the timescale, and
only the mean and the standard deviation change. But
this is only true in the limit of very large timescales,
or more generally speaking in the case where the con-
sidered distribution is already a stable distribution [11].
For ﬁnancial data this approach can be problematic as is

shown in Fig. 1, where a comparison between the nor-
malized distributions of the log returns on the scale of
one minute and on the scale of seven hours is displayed.
There have been several studies with the aim to provide
insight into this problem, for example [12, 13]. A dis-
cussion of the importance of risk measures like VaR and
their connection to the underlying distribution can be
found in [14, 15].

When considering individual stocks, for very large time
scales the normalized distribution is quite similar to
a Gaussian distribution. For small timescales a Non-
Gaussian fat-tailed distribution is obtained. An inter-
esting question now arises. Is this transition from a fat-
tailed distribution towards a Gaussian a smooth and uni-
form process? A general non-parametric method, utiliz-
ing a Fokker-Planck equation in timescale, has been pro-
posed, which provides a general description of how the
shape of the distribution evolves with changing timescale
it is
[16]. Although this approach is very general,
based on assumptions that are partially no longer ful-
ﬁlled for very small time scales (typically smaller than
several minutes). Therefore here a more speciﬁc non-

parametric approach is presented, which provides insight
into timescales covering seconds and minutes. After re-
marks on the used data sets, in Section III we present dif-
ferent measures to quantify the dependence of the shape
of distribution on the timescale. In Section IV the tran-
sitions from the fat-tailed distribution towards a Gaus-
sian distribution are shown for the diﬀerent data sets
mentioned in Section II. In Section V a comparison of
this transition for ﬁnancial data and turbulence data is
provided. Some implications of the results towards risk
analysis are presented in Section VI.

In this study tick-by-tick data sets are used, in order
to cover timescales as small as possible. The ﬁnancial
data sets were provided by the Karlsruher Kapitalmarkt
Datenbank (KKMDB) [17]. The data sets contain all
transactions on IBIS and XETRA in the corresponding
period. The data used in this study span from the be-
ginning of 1993 till the end of 2003. Only stocks with a
continuous history of trading in this period were consid-
ered. Results are presented for the German Stock Index
DAX itself and the three stocks with the largest number
of trades in this period. These three stocks are Bayer,
Volkswagen(VW) and Allianz. The data sets contain
3 − 4 · 106 data points.

In order to investigate changes of the shape of the dis-
tribution, we analyze in general normalized distributions
and therefore look at the normalized return variable R,
which is created from the log return by subtracting the
mean and dividing by the standard deviation.

tion for three stocks in dependence on the timescale.

the timescale. Secondly if the shape is not constant this
provides a quantitative measure of the size of the change
in the shape of the distribution. Therefore a measure
is needed to quantify the distance between two distribu-
tions. Here, the Kullback-Leiber-Entropy is used. It is
deﬁned through the following equation [19]:

dK(p(τ, R), pR(R)) :=

dR p(τ, R) · ln

In order to demonstrate the independence of our results
on the particular choice of the measure we used also the
weighted mean square error in logarithmic space with
normalization constant:

R =

r − r
r2 − r2

dM (p(τ, R), pR(R)) :=

In order to compare the ﬁndings for stocks to other
systems, the same analysis is performed for a turbulence
data set. The data set was obtained by measuring the
local velocity of a ﬂuid in the turbulent wake behind a
cylinder with a Taylor-based Reynolds number of 180.
For the measurement of the longitudinal and transversal
velocity component a X-hotwire was used. The data was
sampled at a frequency of 25 kHz and contain 31 · 106
data points. The mean velocity was 9.1 m/s. For more
details concerning the data sets see [18]

III. METHOD

A non-parametric approach to the detection of a
change in shape of a distribution is a direct measure-
ment of the distance between two distributions, the dis-
tribution, pR(R), computed for a reference timescale, and
the distribution, p(τ, R), computed for another timescale.
Firstly this allows veriﬁcation of the frequently pro-
posed assumption of a constant shape with respect to

dR (p(τ, R) + pR(R))(ln p(τ, R) − ln pR(R))2

dR (p(τ, R) + pR(R))(ln2 p(τ, R) + ln2 pR(R))

It can be shown, that dM is conﬁned to a ﬁxed interval.

Furthermore the chi-square distance is used as a third
measure:

for a certain timescale from a reference distribution. For

available for the DAX index in our data sets. The dots represent the estimated value, the dotted lines the one sigma error

Gaussian, therefore the Gaussian distribution is a good
ﬁrst choice for the reference distribution. In Fig. 2 the
Kullback-Leiber distance to the Gaussian distribution for
three individual stocks is shown. It is evident, that the
behavior changes considerably for timescales smaller than
100s.

IV. EVIDENCE OF A NEW UNIVERSAL
SMALL TIMESCALE REGIME

In the following these small timescales, ranging be-
tween 1s and 100s, are analyzed in more detail. For these
scales the pdfs of ﬁnancial data are quite diﬀerent from
the Gaussian distribution. Therefore the distribution of
the smallest scale of the considered asset is chosen as a
reference distribution. In Fig. 3 the distance dK to the
smallest timescale for the DAX index and three stocks
is shown. Additionally, the dotted lines provide the one

sigma error estimate. The error estimate was calculated
by means of sub-samples of the data set to estimate the
distribution of the distance measure. Again a transition
behavior is seen, indicating a change in the stochastic
behavior in the region 10s -100s for the three individ-
ual stocks. For the DAX index itself a similar transition
behavior is visible, but the region where this happens
is diﬀerent, it spans the timescales between 10min and
60min. This may be due to the diﬀerent kind of data.
For individual stocks a price P (t) at a certain time t is
only obtained, if a transaction at time t is performed.
For the DAX index on the contrary a value is computed
with a certain frequency as a weighted sum of the indi-
vidual stock prices. This computation is independent of
whether a transaction is indeed occurring at this time for
the underlying individual stocks. For further discussion
see [20]. But in all four cases the ﬁrst region may be
characterized by a linear increase of the distance mea-
sure dK . The linear ﬁt for this ﬁrst region is drawn as

a solid line in the corresponding ﬁgures (Note the use of
semilog plots).

In order to verify if the region with the linear behav-
ior is dependent on the chosen reference timescale, the
distance measure dK has been calculated for diﬀerent
reference timescales. As an illustration, the results for
Volkswagen at timescales of 1s, 2s, 5s and 10s of the ref-
erence distribution are shown in Fig. 4. For all these ref-
erence distributions the extent of the linear region (more
precisely the upper bound) does not change. This and
similar results for the other assets indicate, that the lin-
ear region is independent of the timescale that was cho-
sen for the reference distribution. The only constraint
is, that the timescale of the reference distribution has
to be smaller than the timescale where the linear region
ends. Indeed if the results for the case where the refer-
ence distribution is a pdf on very small timescales are
compared to the case where the reference distribution is
the Gaussian distribution, it can be seen that the transi-
tion to another functional behavior is always happening
at similar timescales.

As discussed before, other measures are applied to
quantify the distance between the considered distribution
and a reference distribution. As an example the distance
to the smallest timescale for VW is shown in Fig. 5 using
the three diﬀerent distance measures deﬁned in Eq. 3, 4
and 6. Similar results were obtained for other stocks.
In order to compare the results, all distance measures
were rescaled, so that the distance to the smallest scale
is always zero, while the distance to the largest scale is
always one. For all three distance measures a division of
the timescale in two parts characterized by the diﬀerent
functional behavior in these parts is evident.

Concluding,

for individual stocks a special small
timescale regime is observed, where the distance to a ref-
erence distribution exhibits distinct properties. If the pdf
on the smallest scale is chosen as the reference distribu-
tion, the functional behavior of the distance measure dK
may be approximated by a linear function. However the
width of this region may vary from stock to stock. For

the

of

stocks presented here the small timescale regime spans up
to timescales of about 15s. A possible reason for the ex-
istence of diﬀerent domains may be a diﬀerent functional
relationship between consecutive increments on diﬀerent
timescales. One way to analyze this is to destroy all
possible causal relationships of consecutive increments.
This can be done by permuting all increments on a cer-
tain timescale and thereby creating a new time series.
Technically, the reference distribution (here the distri-
bution at the smallest timescale) is taken and an arti-
ﬁcial time series is constructed by choosing increments
from this distribution at random. The results are dis-
played in Fig. 6. This new time series exhibits for small
timescales a logarithmic increase in the distance measure
dK. Further there is no longer a division in two distinct
timescale intervals with diﬀerent functional behavior of
the distance measure dK. It therefore is evident, that the
small timescale regime is due to functional relationships
between consecutive increments. In order to investigate
if the dependencies are linear, the autocorrelation func-
tions (ACF) of the considered data sets were calculated.

where r(τ, ti) is the log return on the timescale τ at
the time ti and δ a small number. The results for the
ACF are shown in Fig. 7 - 8.
In Fig. 7 the ACF is
computed for the log returns on a timescale of four sec-
onds. The computation of the ACF for smaller timescales
becomes increasingly diﬃcult due to the very small num-
ber of available log returns on such small timescales. In
agreement with the literature [9] [20] there is a negative
autocorrelation for the smallest lag, while for larger lags
the ACF yields values very close to zero. The ACF of
the magnitude of the log returns is considered in Fig.
8. Here there is a strong positive autocorrelation for
the smallest lag, which is decaying slowly for larger lags.
However, for both ACFs and all the considered stocks

In [13] and [22] it has been shown, that ﬁnance and
turbulence data display common properties. The anal-
ysis described above has therefore also been performed
with turbulence data in order to see if a small timescale
regime is present in that case as well. Due to the fact
that velocity data from turbulent ﬂows can be accurately
measured experimentally, it is possible to obtain long
uniformly sampled time series. Therefore it is possible
to perform very accurate calculation of distributions and
related quantities.

In Fig. 9 the distance dK of the distribution of the
velocity increments to the Gaussian distribution for the
turbulence data is shown. The qualitative behavior for
larger timescales is identical to that observed for indi-

vidual stocks. For very large timescales the distance is
very close to zero, indicating that the considered dis-
tribution of velocity increments is close to the Gaus-
sian distribution. For smaller timescales ranging between
10−4 − 10−2s the distance increases moderately.
It is
important to note the diﬀerence in scale of the distance
measure in Figs. 2 and 9. For timescales smaller than
10−4s a new eﬀect takes control and prevents the distance
measure from further fast increase, keeping it almost con-
stant. Two prominent candidates for this new eﬀect are
the dissipation on small scales for turbulence [18] and the
noise added by the measurement system.

Using the distribution on the smallest possible
timescale for this data set as a reference distribution
the picture gets even more similar. In Fig. 10 the dis-
tance measure dK versus the timescale for the longitu-
dinal and the transversal velocity increment is shown.
For very large timescales the distance measure is almost
constant, suggesting that for this range of timescales the
shape of the distribution is nearly constant. Again, and
similar to the behavior of individual stocks, for smaller
timescales ranging between 10−4 − 10−2s the distance
measure shows a logarithmic increase of dK with respect
to the timescale. However, for the smallest timescales, i.e.
smaller than 10−4s, a clear diﬀerence in behavior com-
pared to individual stocks is visible. The distance mea-
sure dK changes slower for the smallest timescales than
one would expect by extrapolating the distance measure
from the region of logarithmic increase. No linear behav-
ior of the distance measure is found here.

Concluding, the shape of the distribution changes
slowly for very small timescales. For medium timescales
it changes faster, indicated by a logarithmic increase of
the distance measure. For large timescales the shape of
the distribution changes more slowly and remains con-
stant for very large timescales indicating convergence to
the Gaussian distribution.

VI. APPLICATIONS

How does the speciﬁc behavior of the small timescale
regime translate into practical applications? As has been
shown in Fig. 2 the deviation from the Gaussian distri-
bution is increasing much faster in the small timescale
regime than in the normal timescale regime. A visual
inspection shows, that the considered log return distri-
butions deviate into the direction of fat-tailed distribu-
tions. Therefore it might be expected that the proba-
bility mass in the tails of the distribution is increasing
faster if the small timescale regime is entered. In order
to analyze this, the probability mass in the tails of the
distribution is calculated and the results are compared to
the distance measure dK. For the individual stocks the
reference timescale was chosen to be one second while
the reference timescale for the DAX index was 60 sec-
onds. Additionally the probability mass in the tails of
the distribution is calculated as the probability mass be-
yond the 10th standard deviation, where the left and the
right tail are considered together. The results are shown
in Fig. 11. In all four cases it is evident, that the change
of the distance measure corresponds to a change of prob-
ability mass in the tails of the distribution. In the small
timescale regime the increase in the probability mass in
the tails of the distribution is very pronounced. Addition-
ally the estimates of probability mass are rather noisy,
due to the eﬀect that the events are quite rare in this
region, while the estimation of the distance measure is
much more stable. Especially for timescales larger than
103s the estimate of the probability mass becomes more
unreliable, displaying a sudden surge or drop due to the
shrinking total amount of independent returns for larger
timescales.

This indicates a very fast deviation from a Gaussian-like
shape in the small timescale regime. These results could
be conﬁrmed with diﬀerent distance measures, for ex-
ample the chi-square distance or the mean square dis-
tance in logarithmic space. Further it has been shown
that this small timescale regime is a speciﬁc feature of
the ﬁnancial data investigated here. For turbulence data
no such small timescale regime is observed, although ﬁ-
nancial and turbulence data sets exhibit similarities in
the normal timescale regime. Furthermore this partic-
ular small timescale regime can not be reproduced by
trivial randomized data. As an application of this new
approach it has been demonstrated that on entering the
small timescale regime, a large increase in the probability
mass in the tails of the distribution occurs, which could
lead to very diﬀerent risk characteristics in comparison
to that of larger timescales.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

Summarizing, it has been demonstrated that the prop-
erties of the log return distribution of stocks do not
In-
change smoothly if one goes to smaller timescales.
stead, for small timescales a small timescale regime is
entered with diﬀerent properties. In the small timescale
regime, the shape of the distribution changes much faster
than one would expect by extrapolating the behavior
of the normal timescale regime. This small timescale
regime extends for individual stocks to our knowledge
from timescales of around 1s to timescales of around
15s. The small timescale regime can be characterized
by a linear dependence of the Kullback-Leiber distance
dK on the timescale, if as a reference distribution a log
return distribution on a very small timescale is chosen.
In the normal timescale regime the dependence is much
slower and can be assumed to be logarithmic or for very
large timescales independent of the timescale. This result
seems to be independent of the chosen reference distri-
bution as long as the chosen reference distribution is a
log return distribution on a suﬃcient small timescale. If
the Gaussian distribution is taken as a reference distri-
bution, dK is rising very fast with decreasing timescale in
the small timescale regime, while it stays nearly constant
in the normal timescale regime in accordance with [12].

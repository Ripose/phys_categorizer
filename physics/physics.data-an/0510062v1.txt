Abstract

The distribution of return intervals of extreme events is studied in time

series characterized by ﬁnite-term correlations with non-exponential decay.

Precisely, it has been analyzed the statistics of the return intervals of extreme

values of the resistance ﬂuctuations displayed by resistors with granular struc-

ture in nonequilibrium stationary states. The resistance ﬂuctuations are cal-

culated by Monte Carlo simulations using a resistor network approach. It has

been found that for highly disordered networks, when the auto-correlation

function displays a non-exponential and non-power-law decay, the distribu-

tion of return intervals of the extreme values is a stretched exponential, with

exponent independent of the threshold.

I. INTRODUCTION

Fluctuations of prices in ﬁnancial markets, wind speed data or daily precipitations in

a given place for the same time windows are typically described by time series x(t) made

by uncorrelated records1,2. In these cases, by considering the return intervals rq of extreme

events associated with the overcoming of a given threshold q (i.e. the time intervals between

two consecutive occurences of the condition x(t) > q), it can be seen that the rq are ex-

ponentially distributed1,3,4. In other terms, the probability density function (PDF) of the

distribution of the rq is given by1,3,4 :

Pq(r) = (1/Rq) exp(−r/Rq)

(1)

where Rq is the mean return interval. Of course, the higher the threshold q, the bigger

is the value of Rq. On the other hand, in the last years it has become clear that several

other important examples of time series display long-term correlations2,5,6. This is the case

of physiological data (heartbeats7,8 and neuron spikes9), hydro-meteorological records (daily

temperatures2,5,10), geophysical or astrophysical data (occurrence of earthquakes11,12 or solar

ﬂares13), internet traﬃc5 and stock market volatility2,14 records. Long-term correlated series

are characterized by an auto-correlation function, Cx(s), decaying as a power-law:

Cx(s) =< xixi+s >=

1
N − s

N −s

X
i=1

xixi+s ∼ s−γx

with exponent γx (correlation exponent) between 0 and 1. In this case, the mean correlation

time τ , given by the integral over s of Cx(s), diverges. The eﬀect of long-terms correlations on

the statistics of the rq has been ﬁrst studied by Bunde et al.5 and the conclusions of this study

were the following. i) The mean return interval Rq is left unchanged by the presence of long-

terms correlations. ii) The distribution of return intervals becomes a stretched exponential:

(2)

(3)

where the two exponents γ and γx were found to be equal. iii) The return intervals them-

self are long-term correlated with a correlation exponent γ′ ≈ γx. As noted by Altmann

Pq(r) = a exp[−(b r/Rq)γ]

2

and Kantz in a very recent paper2, the result i), obtained by Bunde et al.5 by statistical

arguments, can be identiﬁed with Kac’s lemma15 introduced in the context of dynamical sys-

tems. The results ii) and iii) were obtained in Ref.5 on the ground of numerical calculations

performed on long-term correlated and Gaussian time series generated by the algorithm

described in Ref.16. It must be noted that the result ii) only applies to linear time series

(i.e. to series whose properties are completely deﬁned by the power spectrum and by the

probability distribution, regardless of the Fourier phases)2,6. Apart from this restriction,

the stretched exponential distribution of the rq seems to be a general feature in presence of

long-term correlations in a time series2,6. It must be underlined that this fact has important

consequences on the observation of extreme events: indeed it implies a strong enhancement

of the probability of having return intervals well below and well above Rq, in comparison

with the occurrence of extreme events in an uncorrelated time series. Furthermore, it must

be noted that the stretched exponential distribution depends on the parameter γ only, being

a and b in Eq. (3) functions of γ, as shown in Ref.2.

In this paper it will be analyzed the eﬀect on the distribution of the rq of the pres-

ence of ﬁnite-term correlations with non-exponential decay, a situation which can occur

in systems which are approaching criticality, where intermediate behaviors, consisting in a

non-exponential and non-power-law decay of correlations can emerge4. Precisely, in the fol-

lowing section it will be studied the statistics of the return intervals of extreme values of the

resistance ﬂuctuations displayed by a resistor with granular structure in a nonequilibrium
stationary state17–21.

II. METHOD AND RESULTS

The time series analyzed in this paper consist in the resistance ﬂuctuations of a thin re-

sistor with granular structure, in contact with a thermal bath at temperature T0 and biased

by an external current I. The resistance values are calculated by using the stationary and
biased resistor network (SBRN) model17–22. This model describes a thin ﬁlm with granular

3

structure as a two-dimensional resistor network in a stationary state determined by the com-

petition between two stochastic processes, breaking and recovery of the elementary resistors.

A broken elementary resistor (with resistance 109 higher than the resistance corresponding

to a normal elementary resistor) can be associated with a high resistivity region within the

conducting material. Both processes are thermally activated and biased by the external

current. The resistance of the network and its ﬂuctuations are calculated by Monte Carlo

simulations17,18,21. Within this model, the level of intrinsic disorder in the network (average

fraction of broken resistors in the vanishing current limit23) is controlled by a characteristic

parameter20: λ ≡ (ED − ER)/kBT0, where ED and ER are the activation energies respec-

tively of the breaking and recovery processes. The intrinsic disorder parameter λ ranges

between: λmin < λ < λmax, where λmax corresponds to an homogeneous resistor (perfect

network) and λ = λmin ≈ 0 to the maximum level of intrinsic disorder compatible with a
stationary state of the network (stationary resistance ﬂuctuations)18–21,23.

In addition to this intrinsic disorder, the SBRN model considers also the presence of

a disorder driven by the external current I. As a consequence, for a given value of λ,

and for a network of given size, nonequilibrium stationary states of the network exist only

when I ≤ IB (breakdown threshold). For contrast, when I > IB the network undergoes
an electrical breakdown associated with an irreversible divergence of its resistance17–19,21.

For an arbitrary value of λ this breakdown corresponds to a ﬁrst order transition from a
conducting to a non-conducting state of the network18–20. However, at decreasing λ values,
when λ → λmin, the system becomes more and more close to its critical point18–20.

All the details about the SBRN model and its results can be found in Refs.17–21. However,

it must be noted that this model provides a good description of many features associated

with nonequilibrium stationary states and with the electrical instability of composites and
granular materials17–19,24, including the electromigration damage of metallic lines21. Finally,

it must be underlined that, apart from the speciﬁc system described by the SBRN model, the

method adopted here for generating the time series can be also viewed as a pure numerical

algorithm for generating numerical series with diﬀerent and tunable correlation properties.

spectively.

Then, by indicating with R the resistance of the network (expressed in Ω) and with t

the time (expressed in iteration steps), long R(t) time series (typically made of 1 ÷ 2 × 106

records) have been generated and analyzed for diﬀerent values of λ, of the external current

and of the network size. Precisely, normalized series with zero average and unit variance

have been considered: x(t) ≡ (R(t)− < R >)/σ, where < R > is the average value of the

network resistance and σ the root-mean-square deviation from the average. The analysis has

been performed by calculating the auto-correlation function and the PDF of the x records,

the return intervals rq of the extreme values for diﬀerent threshold q and their distribution

Pq(r) (the values of q are expressed in units of σ). For small λ values (high level of intrinsic

disorder), it has been found that Cx displays a non-exponential and non-power-law decay.

This behavior is diﬀerent from that obtained for high λ values (low level of intrinsic disorder),

where Cx decays exponentially (consistently with the Lorentzian power spectrum reported

in Refs.17,18,20). By focusing on this situation, of interest for systems which are approaching

5

criticality, in the following of this section results will be shown concerning a network of size

125 × 125, biased by a current I = IB = 0.011 A and obtained by taking λ = 0.33.

ries of Fig. 1.

the ﬁrst 5000 intervals are shown.

The x(t) time series is shown in Fig. 1 (only a small portion of the total number of

records, N = 1.6 × 106, is reported in this ﬁgure). As evident from Fig. 1, the resistance

ﬂuctuations exhibit a strong non-Gaussianity and actually their PDF is well described by the

Bramwell-Holdworth-Pinton distribution25, as discussed in Refs.19,20. The auto-correlation

function of x(t) is reported in Fig. 2. The function signiﬁcantly deviates from a single

exponential and from a power-law while it is well ﬁtted by a stretched exponential:

Cx(s) = A exp[(−s/b)γ)]

(4)

with the following values of the ﬁtting parameters: A = 1.23, b = 74.9 and γ = 0.54.

Many other functions have also been considered for the best-ﬁt of the Cx data. However,

it has been found that the stretched exponential optimizes the best-ﬁt procedure with the

minimum numbers of ﬁtting parameters. It must be remarked that a stretched exponential

describes a behavior intermediate between a simple exponential decay (which is obtained for

γ = 1) and a constant behavior (a limit of power-law) for γ → 0. Moreover, the correlation

6

time corresponding to the expression (4) of Cx is ﬁnite.

The sequence of the Nq return intervals of the values above the threshold q = 5 is plotted

in Fig. 3 as a sequence of Nq impulses. The ﬁgure shows that a succession of very short

return intervals (rq ≪ 100, the apparently empty portions of the horizontal axis) is followed

by a succession of long intervals, indicating a strong clustering of the extreme events, a

feature similar to that exhibited by the data of Bunde et al.6 which instead concern long-

term correlated records and very diﬀerent from what observed for uncorrelated time series26.

Thus, the clustering of the extreme events is present even if the x records are not long-term

correlated while they are characterized by a ﬁnite correlation time. This clustering of the

extreme values persists also by lowering the threshold. This is shown in Fig. 4 which reports

the sequence of the return intervals obtained for q = 1.5.

Figure 5 displays the probability density function Pq(r) of the distribution of the return

intervals as a function of rq/Rq for diﬀerent thresholds q ranging from −1.5 to 5.0 (the

probability density has been normalized to Pq(1) ). A double-logarithmic plot of Pq has

been adopted because in this representation a stretched exponential function with exponent

γ appears as a straight line of slope γ. Therefore Fig. 5 shows that the distribution of the

7

return intervals of extreme values of the x-series is well described by a stretched exponential

and that the value of the exponent γ is independent of the threshold q in a large range of

q-values. This occurs even in absence of long-term corrrelations and in presence of a ﬁnite

correlation time. This not-obvious result agrees with the conclusions of Altmann and Kantz

formulated in their recent paper2. For comparison, Fig. 6 reports the probability density

function Pq(r) of the distribution of the return intervals obtained after random shuﬄing the

records of the same x-series: in this case γ = 1, i.e. the distribution of the rq is exponential,

as it must be for uncorrelated time series.

III. CONCLUSIONS

The distribution of return intervals of extreme events has been studied in time series

with ﬁnite-term correlations. Precisely, it has been analyzed the distribution of return

intervals of extreme values of the resistance ﬂuctuations displayed by a resistor with granular

structure in nonequilibrium stationary states. The resistance ﬂuctuations were calculated
by using the SBRN model based on a resistor network approach17–21. It has been found

that for highly disordered networks, when the auto-correlation function displays a non-

exponential and a non-power-law decay, the distribution of the rq is well described by a

stretched exponential with exponent γ largely independent of the threshold q. This result

shows that the stretched exponential distribution describes the distribution of the return

intervals of extreme events not only when long-term correlations are present in the time

series2,5,6, but also when ﬁnite-term correlations exist among the records, characterized by

a non-exponential decay, a situation typical of systems which are approaching criticality.

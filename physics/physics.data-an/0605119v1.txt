Abstract

Formulas are derived to compute the mean number of times a site has been visited during

symmetric Levy ﬂights. Unrestricted Levy ﬂights are considered ﬁrst, for lattices of any dimension:

conditions for the existence of ﬁnite asymptotic maps of the visits over the lattice are analysed

and a connection is made with the transience of the ﬂight. In particular it is shown that ﬂights

on lattices of dimension greater than one are always transient. For an interval with absorbing

boundaries the mean number of visits reaches stationary values, which are computed by means of

numerical and analytical methods; comparisons with Monte Carlo simulations are also presented.

INTRODUCTION

Levy ﬂights are a model of diﬀusion in which the probability of a |z|-length jump is

“broad”, in that, asymptotically, p(z) ∼ |z|−1−α, 0 < α < 2. In this case the sum xk =

k
i zi
is distributed according to a Levy distribution, whereas for α ≥ 2 normal diﬀusion takes

P

place [1], [2]. Interesting problems arise in the theory of Levy ﬂights when considering the

statistics of the visits to the sites, such for instance the number of diﬀerent sites visited

during a ﬂight [3], [4]; in this paper we consider a diﬀerent, but related, problem, namely

the number of times a site visited by a random ﬂyer.

Suppose that a random walk takes place on a d-dimensional lattice L, let s be a site of

L and let P (d)

k (s) be the probability that after k steps the walker is at s. The mean value of

visits to the site s after n steps is [5]

M (d)

n (s) =

P (d)

k (s);

n

Xk=0

(1)

since derivation of Eq. (1) does not depend on the speciﬁc form of the walk [5], it holds

also for Levy ﬂights. In the following it will be assumed M0(s) = P0(s) = δs,0; the asymptotic
value of M (d)

n , denoted by M(d), is deﬁned as M(d) = limn→∞ M (d)

n . It is known [6] that a

random walk is transient if and only if

ﬁnite M(d) implies that the walk is transient.

k (s) < ∞; in other words the existence of

Levy ﬂights have a wide range of applications (see for instance [7] and references therein)

and, in particular, analysis of the number of times a site is visited can be relevant in those

processes, such as random searches, in which it is important not just to determine what sites

have been visited but how often they have been visited; examples of possible applications
range from animal foraging [8] to exploration of visual space [9]. Moreover M (d)
n

can be

given the following interpretation, useful for possible applications: assume that particles
undergoing a Levy ﬂight are continuously generated at the origin, then, at time n, M (d)
C (d)
M (d)

n has been used, in a model based on electrons Brownian motion, to simulate distributions

n (s) is the mean number of particles at site s 6= 0 [10]. This property of

n (s), where C (d)

INFINITE LATTICES

Consider ﬁrst one-dimensional, inﬁnite lattices; the probability of occupancy of site x

where p(y) is the probability of having a displacement of y sites. In case of symmetric

Levy ﬂights the canonical representation of p and P (1)

are [1], [2]

simplicity [2]; a scaling relation holds between P (1)

where 0 < α < 2 and c is a real number, which in the following will be set equal to 1 for
k (x) = k−1/αp(xk−1/α).
k fails to
be a proper distribution not concentrated at a point [6]; therefore representations (3), (4)

If α = 2 Eqs. (3), (4) yield the Gaussian distribution [1], [6], whereas, if α > 2, P 1

and p, namely P (1)

k

are valid only in the interval 0 < α ≤ 2. More recently it has been shown that the analytic
forms of p and P (1)

can be given through a Fox function [12].
Application of (1) and of the scaling relation leads to M (1)

The trend of M (1)

related to the zeta function [13]; for α < 1 the result is

n (x), x 6= 0, obtained above, can be extended in a straightforward

way to multidimensional lattices. Thus Levy ﬂights on lattices of dimensions higher than
one are always transient; if α ≥ 2, M (2)

n (0) = O(log(n)) and, if d > 2, M (d)

n (0) converges to

a ﬁnite value [10], and the walk is transient [6].

n (0) has the same trend of M (2)

n (0) in the Gaussian regime,

an instance of Levy ﬂights increasing the eﬀective dimension of the walk [11].

III. FINITE INTERVALS WITH ABSORBING BOUNDARIES

In case of ﬂights on a bounded set it is obvious that for reﬂecting boundaries M (d)
n

diverges as n increases, since asymptotically P (d)

k ≈ 1/|L|, where |L| is the number of sites
[6], whereas if boundaries are absorbing M(d) exists; here we shall consider just the case
of one-dimensional lattices with absorbing boundaries. The map M (1)
n

can be computed

by means of numerical or analytical methods. In fact, Eq. (2) can be seen as a recursive
method to compute P (1)

and application of (1) provides the result; alternatively, one can

k

use the diﬀusion approximation to derive an analytical formula. Both methods have been

used here and their results have been compared with S(x), the “experimental” number of

visits generated by a Monte Carlo simulation.

In a closed interval [−a, a] Eq. (2) becomes

here, for reason of simplicity, instead of (3), we have used the transition probability,

deﬁned on integers y,

(11)

and p(0) = 0, Z being a normalising constant. A similar form of p has been used in a

work on the average time spent by ﬂights in a closed interval [15].

In case of numerical

calculations, obviously, the absolute length |y| of a step must be truncated to some ﬁnite

value: here max(|y|) = 2a, to allow ﬂights to encompass the whole interval, and consequently
2a
y=−2a |y|−(α+1), y 6= 0. Equation (11) provides a valid transition probability for any
α > 0 and hence it can be used to model also classical Brownian motion; for α → ∞

Z =

P

the process becomes the simple symmetric walk. Note that by combining (2) and (1) a
recursive formula for M (1)
n

can be derived, namely M (1)

x=−a p(x − y)M (1)

n (y) + δx,0;

n+1(x) =

a

however the separate use of (2) and (1) is to be preferred, in that it also yields values of the

P

probability distribution and this is useful to check the correctness of the results.

In the classical theory of random walk the diﬀusion approximation allows to replace
P (1)
k (x) with the pdf P (1)(x, t), solution of the diﬀusion equation [16]; analogously for Levy

5

ﬂights a superdiﬀusion equation can be derived (see, among others, [12] [15], [17]), whose

solution is a series of eigenfunctions fk of the operator Dα [15]. Setting P (1)(x, 0) = δ(x − 0),
the pdf is P (1)(x, t) =

fm(0)fm(x) exp(λmt). Deﬁne, in analogy with the discrete case,

In [17] a solution P (1)(x, t) of the superdiﬀusion equation has been presented that, for

the graph of M tends to a triangular shape as α increases; indeed for simple symmetric

random walk, (α = ∞, p(x) = 1/2δ|x|,1) M(1)(x) = a − |x| [10].

Figure (3) presents the graph of M(1)(0) as a function of α; note that the inﬂection point of

the curve occurs at α = 2, that is at the boundary between Levy ﬂights and classical random

walks. In other words, M(1)(0) shows a “phase transition” from Levy ﬂights, characterised

by small number of visits, to the Gaussian regime where visits are more frequent.

IV. CONCLUSION

The results of this note clarify how the mean number of times a site is visited by a

random ﬂyer depends on the dimensionality of the lattice, the value of α and the boundary

conditions.

In particular,

it has been shown that unrestricted Levy ﬂights are always

transient, but for the unidimensional case with α ≥ 1; restricted ﬂights are transient if the

boundaries are absorbing.

In the last case computations show that the direct numerical

method agrees very closely with “experimental data” generated by the Monte Carlo

simulation, whereas the agreement is worse for Eq. (14), especially when α is small (see

result for α = ∞

values.

whereas Eq. (14) results from the diﬀusion approximation. On the other hand, obviously,

Eq. (14) provides a more general, analytical formula for M(1) and not just a set numerical

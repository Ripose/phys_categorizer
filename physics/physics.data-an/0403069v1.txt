The empirical probability density function for the conditional distribution of the true value of Poisson dis-
tribution parameter on one measurement is constructed by computer experiment. The analysis of the obtained
distributions conﬁrms that these distributions are gamma-distributions.

Let us consider the Gamma-distribution with

where a is a scale parameter and n + 1 > 0 is a
shape parameter. Suppose a = 1, then the proba-
bility density of Gamma-distribution Γ1,n+1 looks
like Poisson distribution of probabilities:

gn(λ) =

e−λ, λ > 0, n > −1.

Let the probability of observing n events in the
experiment be described by a Poisson distribution
with parameter λ, i.e.

f (n; λ) =

for any λ1 ≥ 0 and λ2 ≥ 0, that at one measure-
ment of the number of events n (in our case it
is the number of casual events appearing in some
system for certain period of time) which appear
according to Poisson distribution, the parameter
value of this distribution is described by Gamma-
distribution Γ1,1+n with mean, mode, and vari-
ance n + 1, n, and n + 1, respectively. In other
words conditional distribution of the probability
of true value of parameter of Poisson distribution
is a Gamma-distribution Γ1,1+n on condition that
the measured value of the number of events is
equal to n.

It means that the value n corresponds to the
most probable value of parameter of Poisson dis-
tribution, and the mean value of the number of
events, appearing in Poisson ﬂow in the ﬁxed time
interval, must correspond to the magnitude n+ 1,
i.e. the estimation of parameter of Poisson distri-
bution at one observation is displaced for 1 from
the measured value of the number of events. The

(4)

equation (5) in the considered case allows to mix
Bayesian and frequentist probabilities.

As a result, we can easily construct the conﬁ-
dence intervals, take into account systematics and
statistical uncertainties of measurements at sta-
tistical conclusions about the quality of planned
experiments, estimate the value of the param-
eter of Poisson distribution by several observa-
tions [3,4].

Nevertheless there are works in which the ap-
proaches based on other assumptions of distribu-
tion of true value of parameter of Poisson distri-
bution in presence of its estimation on a single
measurement, for example [5]. Also the works
using Monte Carlo methods for construction of
conﬁdence intervals and for estimations of Type I
and Type II errors in the hypotheses testing have
recently appeared [6,7] (see, also, [8]). Therefore
the experimental test with the purpose to con-
ﬁrm, that the true value of parameter of Poisson
distribution at single observation has density of
probability of Gamma-distribution, and with the
purpose to check up applicability of Monte Carlo
methods to such tasks was carried out.

The structure of the paper is the following. In
the next section the arrangement of computer ex-
periment is considered, in the third section - the
statistical analysis of the results is given, and the
last section contains concluding remarks.

2. The arrangement of measurements

From the identity (5) follows, that any prior,
except the uniform, on value of parameter of Pois-
son distribution in distribution of true value of
this parameter at presence of the measured esti-
mation n is excluded by existence of the boundary
conditions determined by the appropriate sums
of Poisson distributions (see Eq.(5)). Therefore
we carried out the uniform scanning in parameter
of Poisson distribution with step 0.1 from value
λ = 0.1 up to value λ = 20, playing the Poisson
distribution 30000 trials for each value λ (Fig.1)
with the using of function RNPSSN [9].

After scanning for each value of number of the
dropped out events n the empirical density of
probability of true value of parameter of Poisson
distribution to be λ if the observation is equal n

Figure 1. Amount of occurrences of n in the interval
from 0 up to 9. Scanning in parameter of the Poisson
distribution (30000 trials at each value of parameter
λ) was carried out with step 0.1 in the interval of λ
from 0.1 up to 20

was obtained.

3. The analysis of results

In Fig.2 the distribution (a), obtained at scan-
ning (the playing of Poisson distribution with
consequentive increase of the parameter λ after
each series of trials with the ﬁxed value of the
parameter) in parameter λ with the selection of
number of the dropped out events n = 6, and
distribution (b) of the casual value, having Γ1,7
distribution of appropriate area, calculated by the
formula, are shown. One can see that the average
value of parameter λ ≈ 7. It means, the number
of observed events is displaced for one unity by
the estimation of the mean value of Poisson dis-
tribution parameter and correspond to the most
probable value (the mean value has bias).

The same distributions obtained by the selec-
tion of number of dropped out events n = 0
(Fig.3) and n = 8 (Fig.4) superimposed on each
other in logarithmic scale also are shown.

In Tab.1 the values of probabilities of compat-
ibility of the empirical distribution, obtained by
Monte Carlo by the scanning in parameter λ, and

depending on value of parameter λ. The distribution
obtained at Monte Carlo scanning in parameter λ is
superimposed on the distribution obtained by direct
construction of Gamma-distribution Γ1,9

the appropriate Gamma-distribution for values n
from 0 up to 9 are presented. The calculations
are based on the Kolmogorov Test (the function
HDIFF of the package HBOOK [9]). The authors
of a package as criterion of coincidence of two dis-
tributions recommend to use the requirement of
probability value of compatibility more than 0.05.
In Fig.4 the least conterminous distributions are
given.

Thus, the obtained results do not contradict
the statement that conditional distribution of

distribution.

4. Conclusion

In the report Monte Carlo experiment on the
check of the statement, that true value of parame-
ter of Poisson distribution at an estimation of this
parameter on one observation n has probability
density of Gamma-distribution Γ1.n+1, is carried
out. The obtained results conﬁrm the conclusions
of the papers [3,4] about a kind of conditional
distribution of true value of parameter of Poisson
distribution at single observation.

Note, that the given results also specify the ap-
plicability of Monte Carlo method for construc-
tion of conditional distribution of the true value
of parameters of various distributions.

Let us consider the famous equality [1,2] in

k!

Let us suppose that g(µ; k) is the probability
density of parameter of the Poisson distribution
to be µ if number of observed events is equal to k.
It is a conditional probability density. As shown
above (Eq.3) the g(µ; k) is the density of Gamma-
distribution by deﬁnition.

On other side:

if g(µ; k) is not equal to this
probability density and the true probability den-
sity of the Poisson parameter is the other function
h(µ; k) (continuous or with set of points of dis-
continuity by measure 0) then there takes place
another identity

This identity is correct for any µ1 ≥ 0 and

µ2 ≥ 0.

If we subtract Eq.7 from Eq.6 then we have

(g(µ; n) − h(µ; n))dµ = 0.

(8)

We can choose the µ1 and µ2 by the arbitrary
way. Let us make this choice so that g(µ; n) is
not equal h(µ; n) in the interval (µ1, µ2) and, for
example, g(µ; n) > h(µ; n) and µ2 > µ1. In this
case we have

(g(µ; n) − h(µ; n))dµ > 0

(9)

and as a result we have contradiction. The iden-
tity (6) does not leave a place for any prior except
uniform.

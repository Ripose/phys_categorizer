Abstract

A concept of neighborhood in complex networks is addressed based on the cri-
terion of the minimal number os steps to reach other vertices. This amounts to,
starting from a given network R1, generating a family of networks Rℓ, ℓ = 2, 3, ...
such that, the vertices that are ℓ steps apart in the original R1, are only 1 step apart
in Rℓ. The higher order networks are generated using Boolean operations among the
adjacency matrices Mℓ that represent Rℓ. The families originated by the well known
linear and the Erd¨os-Renyi networks are found to be invariant, in the sense that
the spectra of Mℓ are the same, up to ﬁnite size eﬀects. A further family originated
from small world network is identiﬁed.

Several properties of complex networks have been addressed recently, much
inspired by the identiﬁcation of their relevance in the description of the re-
lations among the individual constituents of many systems, which have their
origin from natural to social sciences, telephone and internet to energy sup-
ply, etc. [1,2,3,4]. The huge development in this research area came along with
the proposition of many parameters that might be relevant to the character-
ization of properties of networks. The sofar most established and quantiﬁers
are the distribution of links n(k), clustering coeﬃcient C, mean minimal dis-
tance among the nodes < d >, diameter D, the assortativity degree [5,6]. The
evaluation of these and other indices for actual networks help characterizing
them, putting into some network classes with well deﬁned properties, such as
the small-world [7], the scale-free [8], the Erd¨os-Renyi [9] or random networks,
etc.

As the number of nodes directly connected to node i is ki, n(k) characterizes
the immediate neighborhood of the network nodes. In this work we explore

further neighborhood properties of networks, which are related to the distri-
bution of the number of second, third, ..., neighbors. For the sake of simplicity,
we assume that the networks we consider herein are connected, i.e., each node
can be reached from any other one. Two nodes are ℓ − th neighbors, or neigh-
bors of order O(ℓ), when the minimal path connecting them has ℓ steps. Then,
for a given network R, the explicit evaluation of the distributions of neighbors
O(ℓ) along the network, ℓ = 1, 2, 3, ... promptly indicates the structure of min-
imal paths connecting the nodes. This classiﬁes uniquely the neighborhood of
a vertex, in the sense that if two vertices are O(ℓ) neighbors, they are not
O(j) neighbors for ℓ 6= j. Also, we consider that any vertex is O(0) neighbor
of itself.

It is expected that the neighborhood properties change with ℓ. However, if a
meaningful criterion G can be devised, according to which the ℓ-neighborhoods
of R remain invariant, it may be important to assign R a G neighborhood in-
variant (NI) property. It characterizes an invariance of R with respect to length
scale, provided length is measured by number of steps along the network. Also,
it is distinct both from the scale free distribution of vertex connections, as well
as from geometrical scale invariance included in the construction of the net-
work as, for instance, in the class of Apollonian networks (AN).

In our investigation we identiﬁed, for each ℓ, all O(ℓ) neighbors of R and
constructed a family of networks R. Each Rℓ ∈ R is deﬁned by the same set
of nodes, while links are inserted between all pairs of vertices that are O(ℓ)
neighbors in R ≡ R1. Thus, the family R characterizes the neighborhood
structure of R. The Rℓ’s were actually set up by a corresponding family M of
adjacency matrices (AM) Mℓ [5], achieved by the systematic use of Boolean
(B) operations [10] among matrices.

To deﬁne a neighborhood invariance criterion, it is necessary to identify a
relevant network property that may be present in all elements of R, e.g.,
the corresponding values for nℓ(k) and Cℓ [11]. However, these are global
indices that do not provide a suﬃciently precise identiﬁcation of a network. A
much more precise characterization is based on the eigenvalue spectra of the
family Mℓ[12,13], even if it is well known that there may exist topologically
distinct networks which share the same spectrum (co-spectral), and that only
the complete set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors univocally characterizes a
network. A spectrum based invariance criterion condenses (in the sense of
reducing from N 2 elements of M to N numbers) a lot of information about
the network, and has been used herein. This can be further justiﬁed by the
fact that, if two AM’s in Mℓ have the same spectrum, they diﬀer only by a
basis transformation.

Before proceeding with details of the guidelines of our actual work, we recall
that the ﬁrst matrix M1, which describes the original network R1, has only 0’s

2

or 1’s as entries for all of its elements. If M1 is applied to a unitary vector vℓ,
with all but one entry ℓ set to 0, the resulting vector expresses which vertices
are linked to the the vertex ℓ. If we take the usual matrix product of M1
by itself, the non-zero elements (M 2
1 indicates
how many possible two-step walks along the network, with endpoints r and s
exist. Contrary to what happens with M1, M 2
1 )rs > 1,
indicating multiplicity of paths starting at r and ending at s. In particular, all
elements (M 2
1 )rr of the diagonal can have this property, since they count all
two-step walks that start at r, visit any of the vertices s to which r is linked
(M1)rs = 1, and turn back to r. The same interpretation is valid for all usual
powers of M1.

1 )rs of the resulting matrix M 2

1 has many elements (M 2

As the elements of M1 are all 0’s or 1’s, we can regard (M1)rs as B variables,
and use the B sum, subtraction and product operations [10], respectively
⊕, ⊖, ⊗,

0 ⊕ 0 = 0 1 ⊕ 0 = 1 0 ⊕ 1 = 1 1 ⊕ 1 = 1

0 ⊖ 0 = 0 1 ⊖ 0 = 1 0 ⊖ 1 = 0 1 ⊖ 1 = 0

0 ⊗ 0 = 0 1 ⊗ 0 = 0 0 ⊗ 1 = 0 1 ⊗ 1 = 1

(1)

to deﬁne B operations between matrices of B elements. The B matrix opera-
tions are deﬁned by using the usual matrix element operation rules, replacing
the usual sum, subtraction and product involving matrix elements by the
corresponding B operations. To avoid multiplicity of notation, we will use
hereafter the same symbols ⊕, ⊖ and ⊗ to indicate matrix B operations.

If we consider M2 = M1 ⊗ M1 and compare it to M 2
1 , we see that the posi-
tion of all their zero elements coincides, while if we collapse to 1 all non-zero
elements of M 2
1 we obtain M2. In fact, M2 indicates the possibility of two-
step walks, while it deletes the information on the multiplicity of walks. As
the neighborhood concept does not take path multiplicity into account, the B
operations are well suited to deﬁne the matrices Mi.

For instance, M2 can be expressed by

M2 = (M1 ⊕ M2) − (I ⊕ M1) = (I ⊕ M1) ⊗ M1 − (I ⊕ M1),

(2)

where I indicates the identity matrix. To see this note that all forward-
backward walks, included together with pairs of distinct sites linked by two-
step walks in M2, can not be present in M2, as any vertex has been deﬁned to
be O(0) neighbor of itself. Thus we must subtract I from M2. Also, it is neces-
sary to B sum M1 to M2, and subsequently subtract M1, as M2 may describe
two-step walks between two sites that were already related in the original net-

work R1. Noting that M0 ≡ I, Eq.(2) can be generalized for arbitrary value
of ℓ by:

Mℓ = (

Mj) ⊗ M1 − (

Mj) = Mℓ−1 ⊗ M1 ⊖ (

Mj).

Once a precise procedures to set up all Mℓ’s is available, let us brieﬂy comment
on several possibilities opened by the knowledge of M for the purpose of
evaluation of network indices. 1) If we have a ﬁnite network with N vertices,
then there is a large enough ℓmax such that Mℓ ≡ 0, ∀ℓ > ℓmax. Thus, the value
for D is found when the ﬁrst Mℓ ≡ 0 is found. Also, when ℓ approaches D, the
Mℓ’s become sparser and, as a consequence, the number of zero eigenvalues
increases largely. 2) As for each r, s pair, (mℓ)rs = 1 for only one Mℓ ∈ M,
one can collapse in a single matrix

all information on the neighborhood of any pairs of vertices. Particularly, all
pairs r, s of the O(ℓ) neighbors satisfy
Mrs = ℓ. 3) To obtain the average
minimal path for each node r, it is suﬃcient to sum all elements of the r − th
c
M and divide by N − 1. The average minimal path for the
row (or column) of
network follows immediately. 4) The evaluation of all Cℓ by means of line to
c
line multiplication of matrix elements, can be easily computed once the family
M has been obtained. 5) The matrix
M can be easily used to visualize the
structure of network with the help of a color or grey code plots.

The numerical evaluation of the eigenvalue spectra λr
ℓ, r ∈ [1, N] for the family
Mℓ has been carried out for several networks. For each one of them, we are
particularly interested to understand how the form of the spectral density
ρℓ(λ) as function of λ evolves with ℓ. We ﬁrst illustrate the procedure by
showing how the spectra of the standard AN depends on ℓ. Several properties
of AN’s have been discussed recently [14,15]: they are constructed according to
a precise geometrical iteration rule that grant them topological self-similarity
and a scale free distribution of nodes degrees. The M1 spectra of the AN for g
successive generations converge very quickly to a well deﬁned form. However,
for the ﬁnite size networks up to g = 8, with 3283 vertices, we can not identify
any sort of invariance in the eigenvalues density distribution ρℓ(λ). This is
better visualized with the help of the integrated spectra [16]

for successive generations, as shown in the Figure 1. Π1 and Π2 converge very
quickly to distinct g independent forms. Thus, scale free distribution of node
degrees and self similarity do not necessarily lead to NI.

Exact NI invariance is observed for the linear chain network with periodic
boundary conditions, where each vertex interacts only with its two next neigh-
bors. The corresponding AM M1 has a well known pattern, where all 1 ele-
ments are placed along the nearest upper and lower diagonals to the matrix
main diagonal. This matrix has been used to describe a very large number
of models in 1 dimension, like the system of phonons, tight-binding electrons
[17,18], etc. Also, it has been used as the starting point to construct small
world networks, by changing some of the original nearest neighbors links ac-
cording to a given rewiring probability pw. For M1, ρ is expressed analytically
by the relation [17,18,19]

ρ(λ) ∼

1
(4 − λ2)1/2 .

(6)

The other matrices of the family Mℓ keep essentially the same shape, with
two sequences of 1’s along near-diagonals. Each one of them moves one step
away from the main diagonal upon increasing the value of ℓ by 1, but this
does not change the spectrum. Indeed, this operation can be regarded, e.g.
in the analysis of tight-binding systems, as a decimation procedure of half
of the sites along with a renormalization of the hopping integral [19]. The
resulting system has exactly the same shape as the original and, consequently,
the same spectral density. The diameter of the network depends linearly on
N, as diagonals move away one step when ℓ is increased by 1.

The Erd¨os-Renyi networks [9] constitute another class where one could expect
to ﬁnd NI. Indeed, if connections are randomly distributed for R1, so should
they also be for all members of R. For very low values of p (the connection
probability between any two nodes), R1 is split into several disjoint clusters,
and this situation is preserved for all other Rℓ’s. In such cases, the M1 spectral
density does not obey a simple analytical expression, being constituted by

some individual peaks superimposed on a shallow background. The Mℓ (ℓ ≥ 2)
spectra also share the same qualitative structure. Quantitatively, it is observed
an increase of the λ = 0 dominant peak and a decrease of the other peaks.
This is related to the clustered structure of the network and to the fact that
several clusters are reaching their own diameter.

When p = c/N z, with z < 1, and for such large enough c, almost all nodes
are connected in a single cluster, and ρ obeys the well known semicircle law
[20,21]

ρ(λ) ∼ (4 − λ2)1/2.

(7)

In this regime, networks usually have a very small diameter, and invariance
can only be noted for a few values of ℓ. For the average node number hki ≃ 0.5,
we have found that the ρ2 also obeys (7), as shown in the Fig. 2b. However,
for smaller values of hki, a clear skewness in the distribution is observed for
ρ2, despite the semicircle form of ρ1. We conclude that Erd¨os-Renyi networks
are NI for a restricted subset of p and c.

Watts-Strogatz- small network starting from a next-nearest neighbor linear chain
and pw = 0.2.

We have also investigated small world networks obtained along the Watts-
Strogatz rewiring procedure[7], starting both from the above discussed next-
neighbor (nn) and the nearest-next-neighbor (nnn) linear chains. In Figure 3,
we show a sequence of Mℓ spectra for very small value of pw, starting from a
nn chain. We see that the ρ(λ) is split into two parts: the ﬁrst one, essentially
described by Eq.(6), corresponds to the contribution of unperturbed segments
of the linear chain. We see that, as it happens to the whole spectra when
pw = 0, this part remains almost invariant, at least for a large number of Mℓ.
The other part of the spectra, located outside of this ﬁrst region, has no well
deﬁned shape. It entails a considerably lower number of eigenvalues, which
increases with ℓ. This indicates that, at each increase of ℓ, a small number
of eigenvalues migrates from the unperturbed part into it, as the number of
vertices that are aﬀected by the rewiring operation increases with i. This
successive migration ends up by aﬀecting the whole form of the spectrum for
large enough ℓ. Of course this behavior depends on the value of pw. If we
increase it, there is a smooth transition on the shape of the M1 spectrum,
until it reaches a pattern with many structures and bands, similar to that of
the AN.

For pw in the range pw ∼ 0.15−0.22, we have observed that, as ℓ increases, the
spectral density ρℓ evolves towards a very peculiar form, which remains almost
invariant for several values of ℓ, as shown in the Figure 4. This spectrum has
its own features, distinct from those discussed before for the fully ordered
and disordered networks. For the speciﬁc case pw = 0.21 and N = 1000, we
have a large diameter D = 15, and the shown form of the spectra remains
invariant for ℓ ∈ [7, 10]. For smaller values of ℓ, the shape changes steadily
from a structured shapes similar to those in Figure 3 into the invariant form.
For larger values of ℓ, ﬁnite size eﬀects lead to quite sparse Mℓ, with a large
number of zero eigenvalues: ρℓ evolves to a δ like distribution centered at λ = 0.

ℓ. The particular shape in Figure 4 is associated with roughly dense matrices
when ℓ ∈ [7, 10]. For smaller and larger values of ℓ, matrices have rather
distinct structure.

For other values of N, we have observed the same evolution. For instance,
when N = 1500 and 2000, the shape lasts almost invariant for more gener-
ations, respectively ℓ ∈ [8, 12] and [11, 16], indicating that this behavior can
be more robust as N increases. For pw larger than the range given above, this
persistence in the form is not observed. For smaller values of pw the spectra
changes very slowly as shown in Figure 3. In such cases, ﬁnite size eﬀects set
in prior than any tendency of evolution towards the form shown in Figure 4.

To conclude, in this work we have discussed the concept of higher order neigh-
borhood and neighborhood invariance of networks. These have been obtained
by a systematic use of Boolean matrix operations and the deﬁnition of a AM
family. We explored well-know networks, showing that this property is not
equivalent to other concepts of scale and geometrical invariance. Further, we
looked for evidence of NI based on the invariance of the spectral density, iden-
tifying this property in the linear chain, Erd¨os-Renyi network, and ﬁnally, in
a non-trivial class that evolves from Watts small world network.

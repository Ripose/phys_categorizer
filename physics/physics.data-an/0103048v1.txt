Abstract

Multipath propagation of radio waves in indoor/outdoor environments shows a highly irregular

behavior as a function of time. Typical modeling of this phenomenon assumes the received signal

is a stochastic process composed of the superposition of various altered replicas of the transmitted

one, their amplitudes and phases being drawn from speciﬁc probability densities. We set out to

explore the hypothesis of the presence of deterministic chaos in signals propagating inside various

buildings at the University of Calgary. The correlation dimension versus embedding dimension

saturates to a value between 3 and 4 for various antenna polarizations. The full Liapunov spectrum

calculated contains two positive exponents and yields through the Kaplan-Yorke conjecture the

same dimension obtained from the correlation sum. The presence of strange attractors in multipath

propagation hints to better ways to predict the behaviour of the signal and better methods to

counter the eﬀects of interference. The use of Neural Networks in non linear prediction will be

illustrated in an example and potential applications of same will be highlighted.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Multipath propagation of radio waves in indoor or outdoor environments shows a highly

irregular behavior as a function of time [1]. The characterization of radio channels in mobile

or in building propagation is important for addressing issues of design, coding, modulation

and equalization techniques tailored speciﬁcally to combat time and frequency dispersion

eﬀects.

Irregular behavior of the received signal has prompted researchers in the past to model the

channel with stochastic processes. One of the earliest linear models in this vein is the Turin

et al. model [2] in which the impulse response of the channel is written as a superposition

of replicas of the transmitted signal delayed and having altered amplitudes and phases.

A number of models exist diﬀering in the numbers of replicas of the signal or in the type

of probability distributions from which the amplitudes and phases are drawn. Also, diﬀer-

ent stochastic processes are used in the generation of delay times of received replicas. The

popular choice for the amplitude probability density functions (PDF) are Rayleigh or Rice

PDFs depending on whether a weak or strong line of sight propagation exists; nevertheless

other PDFs have been used such the lognormal, Nakagami-m or uniform. The phases ought

to be drawn from PDFs compatible with the ones selected for the corresponding ampli-

tudes; nevertheless the most popular choice found in the literature is the uniform [0 − 2π]

distribution. Delay times are usually extracted from either stationary of stationary Poisson

processes although in some cases the Weibull PDF is used.

II. A HYPOTHESIS OF DETERMINISTIC CHAOS

Although an assumption of stochastic behavior in mobile or indoor propagation is ubiqui-

tous, in the present work we set out to explore the hypothesis that the indoor communication

channel displays deterministically chaotic behavior. This question is important in many re-

spects and the tools to answer it readily exist. These tools are based on the determination

of the correlation dimension of the strange attractor associated with the multipath proﬁle

considered as a real valued time-series x(t). Using delay coordinates [3] one forms the m-

dimensional delay vector X(t) = [x(t), x(t − T )...x(t − (m − 1)T ] with delay T and computes

the correlation sum C(r) which is the ratio of the number of pairs of delay vectors (the

2

distance between which is less than r) to the total number of pairs. From this, the corre-

lation dimension ν is deﬁned as the logarithmic slope of C(r) versus r for small r. For a

true stochastic process, ν increases with m without showing any saturation. In contrast,

for deterministic chaos, ν saturates at a value, the next integer greater than which, rep-

resent the minimum number of non-linear recursion or diﬀerential equations from which

it originates. If the proﬁle turns out to be deterministic, the modulation, coding and de-

tection/demodulation techniques ought to be adapted accordingly in order to account for

this fact; otherwise one has to rely upon techniques capable of handling stochastic signals.

Let us illustrate this by an analysis of multipath measurements we have made in an indoor

environment.

III. EXPERIMENT AND CORRELATION DIMENSION ANALYSIS

The propagation environment from which the data are collected are hallways in the En-

gineering Building at The University of Calgary [4]. The transmitted power was 10 dBm

fed into a half wave dipole antenna with a matching balun. The receiving antenna was a

cross-polarized dipole array. The co-polarized antennas (CPA) and crosspolarized antennas

(XPA) proﬁles referred to in Figure 1 are from a single measurement run and points from

both proﬁles were obtained in coincident pairs. The terms CPA and XPA simply refer to

the relative state of polarisation between the transmit and receive antennas. The receiving

hardware was specially developed to measure diversity characteristics and gives an accu-

rate reference between distance from transmitting to receiving antennas and received signal

strength. The same measurement procedure was employed as for the arbitrarily polarized

data set. We have estimated the correlation dimension for the sets of data: Arbitrarily

Polarized Antennas (APA, 6000 data points), co-polarized (CPA, 3800 points) and Cross-

polarized antennas (XPA, 3800 points) by the box-counting method of Grassberger and

Procaccia [3]. There are a number of limitations and potential pitfalls with correlation

dimension estimation that have been discussed by various authors [5]. In addition, the num-
ber of operations it takes to estimate C(r) is O(N 2) where N is the number of collected

experimental points. Recently Theiler [5] devised a powerful box-assisted correlation sum

algorithm based on a lexicographical ordering of the boxes covering the attractor, reducing

the number of operations to O(Nlog(N)) and incorporating several test procedures aimed

3

at avoiding the previous pitfalls. Before we used Theiler’s algorithm, we made some pre-

liminary tests against well known cases. We generated uniform random numbers, Gaussian

random numbers, and numbers z(n) according to the logistic one-dimensional map at the

onset of Chaos: z(n+1) = a z(n)(1-z(n)) with a = 3.5699456 and in the fully developed

Chaotic regime at a=4.

In the ﬁrst two cases we found ν approximately equal to m as

expected in purely stochastic series whereas ν saturated respectively at 0.48 and 0.98 (we

used 2000 points only) for the logistic map indicating the presence of a low dimensional

attractor and deterministic Chaos (the exact correlation dimensions for the logistic map is

0.5 at a=3.5699456 and 1 for a=4.). We tested as well the H´enon two dimensional map,

the Lorenz three dimensional system of non-linear diﬀerential equations, the R¨ossler three

and four dimensional systems as well as an inﬁnite dimensional system, the delay-diﬀerential

Mackey-Glass equation whose attractor dimension is tunable with the delay time. The re-

sults we found for the various correlation dimensions agreed with all the results known in the

literature to within a few percents. Then we went ahead and examined the ν vs. m curves

for the three sets of experimental data along with a set of 6000 Rayleigh and band-limited

Rayleigh distributed numbers which constitute prototypic received envelopes. Our results,

in Figure 1 show that, while ν ∼ m for the pure Rayleigh case (with a slope equal to one),

and ν ∝ m for the band limited Rayleigh case (with a slope smaller than one) the ν vs.

m curves for the three examined experimental sets of data start linearly with m then show

saturation indicating the presence of a low dimensional attractor (whose dimension is about

4 for CPA and XPA data whereas it is slightly above 4 for the APA situation). This ﬁnding

is in line with the Ruelle criterion [6] that sets an upper bound on the possible correlation

dimension one can get from any algorithm of the Grassberger-Procaccia type. This upper

bound is set by the available number of data points N in the time series. The dimension

that can be detected should be much smaller than 2 log10(N). Since we used 3800 and 6000

points respectively, the upper bound for the detectable correlation dimension in our case

is about 7.16 to 7.56. We respect this bound since our correlation dimensions are around

4. Nevertheless the presence of Chaos is going to be conﬁrmed through another route, the

spectrum of the Liapunov exponents that will be discusssed next.

IV. SPECTRUM OF THE LIAPUNOV EXPONENTS

The spectrum of Liapunov exponents is very important in the study of dynamical systems.

If the largest exponent is positive, this is a very strong indication for the presence of Chaos in

the time series originating from the dynamical system. The reciprocal of this exponent is the

average prediction time of the series and the sum of all the positive exponents (if more than

one is detected like in hyper-chaotic systems such as the R¨ossler four dimensional system of

non-linear diﬀerential equations or the large delay Mackey-Glass equation) is the Kolmogorov

entropy rate of the system. The latter gives a quantitative idea about the information

processes going on in the dynamical system. In addition, with the Kaplan-Yorke conjecture,

the full spectrum gives the Hausdorﬀ dimension of the strange attractor governing the long

time evolution of the dynamical system. We have calculated the Liapunov exponents of

the data with four diﬀerent methods. Firstly, we determined the largest exponent λmax

from the exponential separation of initially close points on the attractor and averaging over

several thousand iterations. Second, we determined the largest Liapunov exponent from the

correlation sum with the help of the relation C(r) ∼ rνexp(−mT λmax) valid for large values

of the embedding dimension m and small values of r. Finally, we determined all exponents

with two diﬀerent methods: the Eckmann et al. method [7] and the Brown et al.’s [8]. Our

results for the spectrum of exponents is shown in ﬁgures 2 and 3. We tried several embedding

delay times T and several approximation degrees for the tangent mapping polynomial (as

allowed in the Brown et al. [8] algorithm ) without observing major changes in the spectrum.

Several time series (Logistic map, H´enon, Lorenz, R¨ossler and Mackey-Glass) were tested

for the sake of comparison to results obtained with the experimental data. In addition, the

Liapunov exponents saturate smoothly as they should for large embedding dimension. Then

we applied the Kaplan-Yorke conjecture to get the dimension of the attractor: Using the

following typical numbers we obtained for the exponents λmax = λ1 = 18.06, λ2 = 1.88, λ3 =

−8.85, λ4 = −24.94, λ5 = −68.80 and using the formula:

D = j +

Pi λi
|λj+1|

(1)

where the summation is over i=1,2...j. The λi’s are ordered in a way such that they

decrease as i increases. We determine j from the conditions Pi λi > 0 and: λj+1 + Pi λi < 0.

We get j=3 and D=3.44 for the strange attractor dimension (called its Liapunov dimension).

5

The total sum of the Liapunov exponents is negative ( equal to -82.65) as it should be for

dissipative systems with a strange attractor. The value of the attractor dimension will be

conﬁrmed from the spectrum of singularities or the mutifractal spectrum in the next section.

V. MULTIFRACTAL SPECTRUM

The generalized dimension may be used to characterize non-uniform fractals for which

there are diﬀerent scaling exponents for diﬀerent aspects of the fractal, so-called multifrac-

tals. For these, there are two scaling exponents, one generally called τ , for the support of the

fractal, and one called q, for the measure of bulk of the fractal. In general, τ (q) = (q − 1)Dq,

where Dq is the generalized dimension. Multifractals have been employed to characterize

multiplicative random processes, turbulence, electrical discharge, diﬀusion-limited aggrega-

tion, and viscous ﬁngering [9]. Multifractals have this in common: there is a non-uniform

measure (growth rate, probability, mass) on a fractal support. Besides the exponents, τ and

q, and the generalized dimension Dq, there is another method for characterizing multifrac-

tals. This depends upon the use of the mass exponent α, and the multifractal spectrum,

f (α) [9]. A graph of the multifractal spectrum explicitly shows the fractal dimension, f, of

the points in the fractal with the mass exponent (or scaling index), α. We have estimated

Dq by use of the generalised moments of the correlation sum with a window chosen carefully

enough to avoid temporal correlation eﬀects. We have developed a program that computes

the generalized correlation sum using a box-assisted method. Our program is based on one

written by Theiler [5]. Several modiﬁcations had to be made to the straightforward box-

assisted correlation sum method. In addition, our program allows for logarithmic scaling

with the distance parameter r. From a log-log graph of the generalized correlation sums,

appropriate scaling regions can be identiﬁed, for each order, q. Least-squares ﬁts to these

scaling regions yields a sequence of generalized correlation dimensions, Dq, for values of q

between ±∞. We have found computation of Dq for integers in the interval [-10,10] and

D−∞ and D+∞ to be suﬃcient. From the Dq, we calculate the τ (q) = (q − 1)Dq. We then

perform a Legendre transform to obtain the f (α) curve. We do this by ﬁrst ﬁtting a smooth

curve (a hyperbola was considered to be adequate) to the τ (q) curve. With an analytic

expression for the τ (q) curve, we can compute the Legendre transform in closed form. The

domain of f (α) may be found from D−∞ and D+∞; we assume that α is conﬁned to this

6

region, and that f (α) is 0 at these points. The values of f (α) for D−∞ ≤ α ≤ D+∞ are cal-

culated as min[qα − τ (q)], the minimum being taken over q. We found that this procedure,

although complex, corrects for the known numerical sensitivities of the Legendre transform.

We checked that our method for obtaining f (α) gave the same results as those found in

the literature for the Logistic map and the strongly dissipative circle map [9]. The f (α)

curve for the multipath data is shown in Figure 4. It may be seen that the peak value of

f (α), corresponding to the box-counting dimension at q=0, is about 3.7. This is consistent

with our above ﬁndings from the correlation dimension and the full spectrum of Liapunov

exponents. Our further research in this area concerns the prediction of the received signal

intensity, from our above hypothesis of the presence of deterministic chaos.

VI. NON LINEAR PREDICTION

We applied the above ﬁndings to the non linear prediction of multipath proﬁles consider-

ing that each point on the envelope of the measured signal is a function of some number of

past points in the series, deviating from the traditional wave superposition approach. More

precisely, we write:

y(n + 1) = F [y(n), y(n − 1), y(n − 2), y(n − 3)...y(n − m + 1)]

(2)

with F an m dimensional map and y(n) the value of the signal x(t) sampled at timestep

n. Expressing F as a sum of sigmoidal and linear functions [10] we determine the unknown

weights through the Marquardt least squares minimisation method [11] in order to achieve

the best ﬁt to the data. Our results comparing the onestep prediction to the multipath

data analysed above are displayed in ﬁgure 5. The goodness of ﬁt between the measured

and predicted envelopes for a map dimension m=5 is another indication of the soundness

of the approach. This is conﬁrmed in Figure 6 where we display the normalised prediction

error versus the embedding dimension. A minimum is observed in the prediction error for

an embedding equal to 5 or 6. In Figure 6, we started always from the same initial weights

and let the system run through 150 iterations searching for the least squares minimum

for 200 data points and later on making 300 one step ahead predictions. For embedding

dimension larger or equal to 7 the minimisation procedure stopped because of the presence

of zero-pivot in the least-squares matrices. The presence of a minimum in the prediction

7

error around an embedding equal to 5 or 6 complies again with the value of embedding

dimension used previously in the correlation dimension analysis, the Liapunov spectrum

and the Kaplan-Yorke conjecture.

VII. DISCUSSION

We stress that although the proﬁles we examined were found to be chaotic in all three

experimental conﬁgurations with conﬁrmations from the Liapunov spectrum and non linear

prediction studies, indicating that we would be able to describe our data with a set of at

most 5 non-linear diﬀerential or algebraic equations,

investigation in other propagation

situations is needed. Nevertheless, in our investigations we observed a signiﬁcant amount

of consistency between the various methods of detecting Chaos and characterising it using

embedding dimensions m beyond the minimum mmin required by the Takens theorem

(mmin > 2d + 1, where d is the dimension of the strange attractor). Assuming the

hypothesis of the presence of Chaos in a given multipath proﬁle is ﬁrmly established, many

avenues become possible. For instance, one might consider devising ways for controlling

the signal propagation by altering slightly some accessible system parameter and improving

the performance characteristics of the channel [12]. Shaw [13] has introduced the concept

that a deterministically chaotic system can generate entropy. The consequences of this

observation is important for the design of communication equipment when the channel is

a chaotic system. For one, it implies that information at the receiver about the state of

the channel is lost at a mean rate given by the Kolmogorov entropy. For another it implies

that a channel estimator should be adapted to the mathematical nature of the set of non

linear equations describing the channel as shown in the previous paragraph. Our studies

up to this date have shown that this approach is valid in an indoor situation but not in an

outdoor one. This might be due to the conﬁned geometry one encounters inside buildings

and the boundary conditions for the electromagnetic ﬁelds leading to a low dimensional

system of non linear equations giving birth to the observed chaotic behaviour. Our studies

in this direction are in progress.

one-step ahead prediction over the next 300 points and calculated the resulting squared

error divided by the total of points. One sees a minimum for an embedding dimension

around 5 or 6. For an embedding equal to 7 or larger, a large error or no convergence

(null pivot encountered in the least square error matrices) were observed.

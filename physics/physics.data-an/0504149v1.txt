We introduce a non-perturbative two scale Kirchhoﬀ theory, in the context of light scattering by
a rough surface. This is a two scale theory which considers the roughness both in the wavelength
scale (small scale) and in the scales much larger than the wavelength of the incident light (large
scale). The theory can precisely explain the small peaks which appear at certain scattering angles.
These peaks can not be explained by one scale theories. The theory was assessed by calculating
the light scattering proﬁles using the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) images, as well as surface
proﬁlometer scans of a rough surface, and comparing the results with experiments. The theory is in
good agreement with the experimental results.

I. INTRODUCTION

Wave scattering by rough surfaces has been extensively
studied both analytically and experimentally. For analyt-
ical approaches two methods have been generally consid-
ered: rigorous electromagnetic theory and approximate
methods. The Kirchhoﬀ theory is among the electromag-
netic theories and is known as a ”tangent plane theory”.
This theory is most widely used to calculate the distri-
bution of the specular and diﬀuse parts of the reﬂected
light. The Kirchhoﬀ theory treats any point on a scat-
tering surface as a part of an inﬁnite plane, parallel to
the local surface tangent. The theory is therefore exact
for an inﬁnite, smooth and planar scatterer, but is ap-
proximate for scatterers that are ﬁnite sized, non-planar
or for rough surfaces [1]. Due to the computational limi-
tations, most studies have been done for one dimensional
data of the surfaces. There are only few cases of the
analysis of two dimensional surface data. One and two
dimensional exact approaches have been successfully ap-
plied to dielectric, metallic or perfectly conducting sur-
faces [2,3], deterministic surfaces [4,5], dielectric ﬁlms on
a glass substrate [6] and dielectric ﬁlms [7,8]. Such ex-
act calculations have been compared with experimental
results and approximate models [6,9]. Also some authors
studied wave scattering from random layers with rough
interfaces [10,11].

The joint probability density functions (PDF) of sur-
face slopes and heights P (∂xh, h), is a key function in
the estimation of the main parameters of wave scattering
by a rough surface [12–16]. This is more obvious in a
geometrical optics approach, when the angular distribu-
tion of the scattered power is proportional to the specular
reﬂecting slope PDF. The slope PDF has also been in-
troduced in references [12,15,16] in the context of Bragg

scattering. They have shown that, the Bragg scattering
results must be averaged by the proper slope PDF of the
rough surface. This is also true for the estimation of the
thermal emission from rough surfaces at small grazing
angles [15,16].

In the present paper, we introduce a non-perturbative
two scale Kirchhoﬀ theory. The theory is applied to ex-
plain the small peaks observed in the scattering proﬁle
of a rough surface, at certain scattering angles. The the-
ory employs the data obtained from the rough surface in
two diﬀerent scales. To check the theory we have mea-
sured the scattered light intensity as a function of the
scattering angle, I(θ), using a setup consisting of a He-
Ne laser (632.8nm), a photo-multiplier tube (PMT) de-
tector and a computer controlled micro-stepper rotation
stage. The resolution of the micro-stepper was 0.5 min-
utes. Alumina sheets were used as the rough samples.
The surface topography of the alumina samples in small
scale (< 5µm) was obtained using an atomic force micro-
scope (AFM) (Park Scientiﬁc Instruments). The images
in small scale were collected in a constant force mode
and digitized into 256
256 pixels. A commercial stan-
dard pyramidal Si3N4 tip was used. A variety of scans,
each with size L, where recorded at random locations on
the surface. The large scale (< 5mm) morphology line
scans of the alumina samples were recorded using a sur-
face proﬁlometer (Taylor Hobson). Figures (1) and (2)
show typical AFM image and surface proﬁle data with
resolutions of about 20nm and 0.25µm, respectively.

II. NON-PERTURBATIVE TWO SCALE
KIRCHHOFF THEORY

The Kirchhoﬀ theory is based on three major assump-

tions [1]:

a)- The surface is observed from far ﬁeld.
b)- The surface is regarded as ﬂat, and the optical be-
havior is locally identical at any given point on the sur-
face. Therefore the Fresnel laws can be locally applied.
c)- The amplitude of the reﬂection coeﬃcient, R0 is

independent of the position on the rough surface.

The ﬁeld scattered by the rough surface, ψsc(r), is ob-
tained by an integration over the mean reference plane
SM [1], (the geometry is displayed in ﬁgure (3))

FIG. 2. Proﬁlometer scans of the Alumina surface with res-

In most cases, the wave scattering models from rough
surfaces implicitly assume that the surface is rough on a
single scale. However, in practice all surfaces are rough
on several scales, ranging from atomic scale to the scale
determined by the length of the surface. Nevertheless,
only a ﬁnite range of scales are important in scattering
of waves from a surface, i.e. the range covering the wave-
length of the incident radiation. Models have been devel-
oped for describing surfaces that consist of high frequency
ﬂuctuations superimposed on a slowly varying roughness
[1]. These models use perturbation theories to describe
the scattering from the high frequency roughness and this
is modiﬁed in some manner by the low frequency com-
ponent [17]. All of the perturbative methods deal with
the eﬀect of the large scale ﬂuctuations as perturbation to
the small scale height ﬂuctuations. Here, we intend to ob-
serve the surface in two scales with resolutions of nanome-
ter and micrometer. The ﬁgure (4), shows schematically
the modulation of small scale height ﬂuctuations by large
scale variations. Various statistical parameters like the
joint height and height gradient PDF, surface roughness
σ, correlation function C(R), correlation length τ etc.,
were measured in two scale.

In what follows, we are going to describe the non-
perturbative two scale Kirchhoﬀ theory. We ﬁrst cal-
culate the contributions of the coherent and the diﬀuse
ﬁelds by the Kirchhoﬀ theory in small scale. The coher-
ent ﬁeld with a gaussian height distribution will be [1]:

So far, we have expressed the results of the light scat-
tering from the surface in small scale. Now we divide the
whole surface to many small pieces (meshes) such that
length of which is smallest scale of our observation. In
each mesh we can apply one scale ( small scale) Kirchhoﬀ
theory. Therefore for each mesh we have a similar expres-
sion for coherent ﬁeld as equation (2), but with diﬀerent
angles which depend on the positions of the small mesh.
In the small scale, we denote the height ﬁeld in position
xs and ys with hs. Therefore, one can write the height
ﬁeld in any position, ~x, as follows:

Kirshhoﬀ theory and experimental results for scattered ﬁeld
(bold symbols).

III. COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTS

Here we test the non-perturbative two–scale Kirshhoﬀ
theory with experiment. For this purpose, we obtain
the height proﬁle of the Alumina sheets as the rough
samples, using the proﬁlometer in large scale and the
AFM images in small scales.
Indeed we intend to ob-
serve the surface in two scales; nano-meter and micron.
To use the two scale theory the surface must possess
two conditions. First, the PDF of the height and its
slope must be independent at small and large scales,
i.e. P (hl, ∂xhl, hs, ∂xhs) = P (hl, ∂xhl)P (hs, ∂xhs). The
homogeneous rough surfaces possess this condition. In-
deed statistical parameters in small scale ( roughness,
exponents, etc.) are similar at any point of the sam-
ple (large scale). This means that the two PDFs are
independent. The second condition is that the height
and height gradient ﬂuctuation must be independent
in the large scale. This means that the joint PDF of
the height and height gradients can be decomposed as
P (hl, ∂xhl) = P (hl)P (∂xhl). This assumption needs con-
ﬁrmation. In ﬁgure (6), we have plotted the joint PDF
P (hl, ∂xhl) vs P (hl)P (∂xhl). It is obvious that the joint
PDF vs multiplication of single PDFs ﬁts with a line
with slope one. Considering its statistical error we ob-
serve that the height and height gradient PDFs are inde-
pendent. For large values of h and ∂xh, our assumption
becomes poor and thus uncertainty increases.

To compare the experimental observation with those of
the theoretical prediction, we need estimate the several

tion (8), we need to evaluate the quantity < ψsc

in the small scale and PDF of the height gradients in
the large scale. To evaluate the intensity < ψsc
s >,
we have to use the equation (2), where the averaging is

done in the small scale. Therefore we need the PDF of
height ﬂuctuation in the small scale. Also we need other
statistical quantities such as surface roughness σ, corre-
lation function C(R), correlation length τ etc., in small
and large scales. We evaluate the height -height corre-
lation function < h(x + R)h(x) > vs radial distance R
for large scale ﬂuctuations. We ﬁnd the following expres-
R2

sions for the Alumina surface as, C(R) = 2.14 exp(
and 1.27 exp(
0.58R), for small and large scales, respec-
tively. Also the roughness exponent, variance and scal-
ing length for the small (large) scale have been found as,
0.85 (0.85, 031), 0.31µm (1.33µm) and 1.5µm (19.4µm),
respectively.
It is found that the height PDF in the
two scales are almost gaussian. The estimated statistical
quantities enable us to predict the average total inten-
sity. In ﬁgure (7), we have plotted the experimental ob-
servation and theoretical prediction of total intensity. It
is evident that the theoretical prediction ﬁts with those
of experimental observation. We observe the theory is
180 in the
able to predict small peak in the angle
variation of the total intensity vs angle scale θ2. We
note that if one plots the PDF of height gradient, then
ﬁnds that the PDF has also small peaks at angle scale
tan−1(∂xh)
90. This means that the gradient PDF is
responsible to have a small peak in the variation of the
total intensity in terms of angle scale (we note that the
slope α = tan−1(∂xh), we produces 2α contribution in
the reﬂection of the light from the surface). In ﬁgure (8),
the behavior of the slope PDF (∂xlhl) in terms of ∂xlhl,
has been given. Also as shown in ﬁgure (7), the two scale
Kirshhoﬀ theory is able to predict the small peak in the
variation of the total intensity in terms of angle scale.
As we observe, there are other peaks in the ﬁgure (7),
where the theory can not predict the peaks for large an-
gle scales. Indeed for these angle scales we should take
into account the shadowing eﬀect [15,16]. In ref.[12], the
validity range of geometrical shadow functions has been
investigated for a randomly rough surface for which the
shadowed Kirchhoﬀ approximation has been shown to
give good results for the scattered intensity distribution.
We will discuss the modiﬁcation of the two scale Kirsh-
hoﬀ theory by the shadowing eﬀect elsewhere.

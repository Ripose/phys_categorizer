We consider models for growing networks incorporating two eﬀects not previously considered: (i)
diﬀerent species of nodes, with each species having diﬀerent properties (such as diﬀerent attachment
probabilities to other node species); and (ii) when a new node is born, its number of links to old nodes
is random with a given probability distribution. Our numerical simulations show good agreement
with analytic solutions. As an application of our model, we investigate the movie-actor network
with movies considered as nodes and actors as links.

I.

INTRODUCTION

It is known that many evolving network systems, in-
cluding the world wide web, as well as social, biological,
and communication systems, show power law distribu-
tions. In particular, the number of nodes with k links is
often observed to be nk ∼ k−ν, where ν typically varies
from 2.0 to 3.1 [1]. The mechanism for power-law network
scaling was addressed in a seminal paper by Barab´asi and
Albert (BA) who proposed [2] a simple growing network
model in which the probability of a new node forming
a link with an old node (the “attachment probability”)
is proportional to the number of links of the old node.
This model yields a power law distribution of links with
exponent ν = 3. Many other works have been done ex-
tending this the model. For example Krapivsky and Red-
ner [3] provide a comprehensive description for a model
with more general dependence of the attachment proba-
bility on the number k of old node links. For attachment
probability proportional to Ak = ak + b they found that,
depending on b/a, the exponent ν can vary from 2 to ∞.
Furthermore, for Ak ∼ kα, when α < 1, nk decays faster
than a power law, while when α > 1, there emerges a sin-
gle node which connects to nearly all other nodes. Other
modiﬁcations of the model are the introduction of aging
of nodes [4], initial attractiveness of nodes [5], the addi-
tion or re-wiring of links [6], the assignment of weights
to links [7], etc.

We have attempted to construct more general grow-
ing network models featuring two eﬀects which have not
been considered previously: (i) multiple species of nodes
[in real network systems, there may be diﬀerent species of
nodes with each species having diﬀerent properties (e.g.,
each species may have diﬀerent probabilities for adding
new nodes and may also have diﬀerent attachment prob-
abilities to the same node species and to other node
(ii) initial link distributions [i.e., when
species, etc.)].
a new node is born, its number of links to old nodes is

not necessarily a constant number, but, rather, is char-
acterized by a given probability distribution pk of new
links].

As an application of our model, we investigate the
movie-actor network with movies considered as nodes
and actors as links (i.e., if the same actor appears in
two movies there is a link between the two movies [8]).
Moreover, we consider theatrical movies and made-for-
television movies to constitute two diﬀerent species.

II. MODEL

P

We construct a growing network model which incorpo-
rates multiple species and initial link probabilities. Given
an initial network, we create new nodes at a constant
rate. We let the new node belong to species j with prob-
j Q(j) = 1). We decide how many links l
ability Q(j) (
the new node establishes with already existing nodes by
randomly choosing l from a probability distribution p(j)
.
Then, we randomly attach the new node to l existing
nodes with preferential attachment probability propor-
tional to a factor A(j,i)
, where k is the number of links
of the target node of species i to which the new node of
species j may connect. That is, the connection proba-
bility between an existing node and a new node is deter-
mined by the number of links of the existing node and
the species of the new node and the target node.

l

As for the single species case [3], the evolution of this
model can be described by rate equations. In our case
the rate equations give the evolution of N (i)
k , the number
of species i nodes that have k links,

where S is the total number of species and ¯k(j) =
is the average number of new links to a new node of
species j, and t is normalized so that the rate of creation
of new nodes is one per unit time. The term propor-
tional to A(j,i)
k due
to the addition of a new node of species j that links to
a species i node with k − 1 connections. The term pro-
portional to A(j,i)
accounts for the decrease of N (i)
k
due to linking of a new species j node with an exist-
ing species i node with k connections. The denominator,
, is a normalization factor. If we add
a new node with l initial links, we have l chances of in-
P
creasing/decreasing N (i)
k . This is accounted for by the
factor ¯k(j) =
appearing in the summand of Eq.
(1). The last term, Q(i)p(i)
k , accounts for the introduction
of new nodes of species i. Since all nodes have at least

III. ANALYSIS OF THE MODEL

total number of links increase at ﬁxed rates. The total
number of nodes of species i increases at the rate Q(i).

To most simply illustrate the eﬀect of spread in the

choose [3], Ak = k + c. (Note that by Eq. (1) this is
equivalent to Ak = ak + b with c = b/a.) Inserting this

Ak into Eq. (6), we obtain

and Bk = (k + c)/η, where η = (2

[(k + c)nk − (k + c − 1)nk−1] + ηnk = ηQpk.

(7)

Setting pk = p1(k + c)−β, we can solve Eq. (7) for large k
by approximating the discrete variable k as continuous,
so that

(k + c)nk − (k + c − 1)nk−1 ∼=

[(k + c)nk].

Solution of the resulting diﬀerential equation,

[(k + c)nk] + ηnk = ηQp1(k + c)

(9)

for nk with β 6= η + 1 consists of a homogeneous solution
proportional to (k + c)−(η+1) plus the particular solution,
[ηQp1/(η + 1 − β)](k + c)−β. For β = η + 1 the solution
is nk = ηQp1(k + c)−(η+1) ln[d(k + c)], where d is an
arbitrary constant. Hence, for suﬃciently large k we have
nk ∼ k−(η+1) if β > η + 1, and nk ∼ k−β if β < η + 1.
Thus the result for β > η + 1 is independent of β and,
for c = 0, coincides with that give in Ref. [2] (η + 1 = 3
when c = 0). Solutions of Eq. (7) for nk versus k in the
range 1 ≤ k ≤ 104 are shown as open circles in Fig. 1(a)
for initial link probabilities of the form

pk =

(cid:26)

for 1 ≤ k ≤ 102
for k ≥ 102,

(10)

which are plotted as solid lines in Fig. 1(a). The values of
¯β used for the ﬁgure are ¯β = 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and ∞ ( ¯β = ∞
corresponds to pk ≡ 0 for k > 102). For clarity nk has
been shifted by a constant factor so that n1 coincides
with the corresponding value of p1. Also, to separate the
graphs for easier visual inspection, the value of p1 for
successive ¯β values is changed by a constant factor [since
(7) is linear, the form of the solution is not eﬀected]. We
note from Fig. 1(a) that nk follows pk for k < 102 in all
cases. This is as expected, since pk decreases slower than
k−3 in this range. Furthermore, nk very closely follows pk
for k > 102 for ¯β = 0.5, 1.0, 2.0. As ¯β increases deviations
of nk from pk in k > 102 become more evident, and the
large k asymptotic k−3 dependence is observed. Thus, if
pk decreases suﬃciently rapidly, then the behavior of nk
is determined by the growing network dynamics, while, if
pk decreases slowly, then the behavior of nk is determined
by pk.

To simply illustrate the eﬀect of multiple species we
now consider a growing two species network with pk =

node can link to species 1 nodes only. Thus, the increase
of species 1 links is (1 + γ)Q(1) + Q(2) and that of species
2 links is (1 − γ)Q(1) + Q(2). Since γ is the ratio of the
number of species 1 links to the total number of links,
γ = [(1 + γ)Q(1) + Q(2)]/2 or

In order to illustrate the model with our numerical
simulations, we specialize to a speciﬁc case. We choose
attachment coeﬃcients A(1,1)
=
bk, and A(2,2) = 0. Thus a new species 1 node connects
to either existing species 1 nodes and species 2 nodes with
equal probability, while a new species 2 node can connect
to existing species 1 nodes only. Therefore, the ﬁrst sum-

k ), which is a times the total increase
of links at each time a × 2(Q(1) + Q(2)). Recall that
Q(1) + Q(2) = 1. In order to calculate the second summa-
k kn(1)
tion term in Eq. (11),
k ,
we deﬁne a parameter γ that is the ratio of the total num-
P
ber of links of species 1 to the total number of links in the
network. Since the probability of linking a new species
1 node to existing species 1 nodes is determined by the
total number of links of species 1, this probability is ex-
actly same as γ. Thus, if we add a new species 1 node,
the number of links of species 1 increases by Q(1) due to
the new node and by γQ(1) due to the existing species 1
nodes that become connected with the new node, while
the number of links of species 2 increases by (1 − γ)Q(1).
But, if we add a new species 2 node, the numbers of links
increases by Q(2) for both species because a new species 2

where obtain η(1) = 2/[Q(1) + Q(2)(2 − Q(1))] and η(2) =

Proceeding as for the single species case, we approx-
imate (5) by an ordinary diﬀerential equation (c.f., Eq.
k ∼ k−(1+η(i)). As an example, we set
(9)) to obtain n(i)
Q(1) = Q(2) = 0.5, in which case Eqs. (13) give expo-
nents 1+η(1) = 2.6 and 1+η(2) = 5. In Fig. 1(b) we plot,
for this case, the analytic solution obtained from (5) and
(13) as dashed lines, and the results of numerical simula-
tions as open circles and pluses. The simulation results,
obtained by histogram binning with uniform bin size in
log k, agree with the analytic solutions, and both show
k ∼ k−2.6
the expected large k power law behaviors, n(1)
and n(2)

k ∼ k−5.

IV. THE MOVIE-ACTOR NETWORK

We now investigate the movie-actor network. We col-
lected data from the Internet Movie Data Base (IMDB)
web site [9]. The total number of movies is 285,297 and
the total number of actors/actresses is 555,907. Within
this database are 226,325 theatrical movies and 24,865
made for television movies. The other movies in the
database are made for television series, video, mini se-
ries, and video games.
In order to get good statistics,
we choose only theatrical and television movies made be-
tween 1950 to 2000. Thus we have two species of movies.
We also consider only actors/actresses from these movies.
We consider two movies to be linked if they have an ac-
tor/actress in common. We label the theatrical movies
species 1, and the made for television movies species 2.

k and A(j,i)

In order to apply our model, Eq. (1), we require as in-
put Q(j), p(j)
k which we obtain from the movie-
actor network data. We take Q(1) and Q(2) to be, re-
spectively, the fractions of theatrical and made for tele-
vision movies in our data base. We obtain Q(1) = 0.83
and Q(2) = 0.17. We now consider p(j)
k . Suppose a
new movie is produced casting r actors. For each ac-
tor s (s = 1, 2, ..., r) let ls denote the number of previous
movies in which that actor appeared. Then the total

Incorporating these results for Q(i), p(i)

in
our multi-species model, Eq. (1), we carry out numerical
simulations as follows: (i) We add a new movie at each
time step. We randomly designate each new movie as a
theatrical movie with probability Q(1) = 0.83 or a televi-
sion movie with probability Q(2) = 0.17. (ii) With initial
link probability p(j)
k , we randomly choose the number of
connections to make to old movies. (iii) We then use the
attachment A(j,i)
to randomly choose connections of new
species j movie to old species i movies. (iv) We repeat
(i)-(iii) adding 100,000 new movies, and ﬁnally calculate
the probability distributions of movies with k links.

ing regions [11]. For small k (k . 102) the two species

network is determined by the initial link probability p(i)

In conclusion, in this paper we propose a model for a
multi-species network with variable initial link probabili-
ties. We have investigated the movie-actor network as an
example. We believe that the eﬀect of multiple species
nodes may be important for modeling other complicated
networks (e.g., the world wide web can be divided into
commercial sites and educational or personal sites). We
also conjecture that the initial link probability is a key
feature of many growing networks.

[8] Barab´asi and Albert also investigated the movie-actor
network. However, they consider actors as nodes that are
linked if they are cast in the same movie. See Ref. [2] and
Ref. [6].

is similar to that
used by H. Jeong et al. who presume single species situ-
ations (in which case the superscripts j, i do not apply).

[11] Similar observations suggesting two scaling regions have
also been recently observed in other cases of growing
networks. Barab´asi et al. investigated the scientiﬁc col-
laboration network [A.-L. Barab´asi, et al., ArXiv:cond-
mat/0104162 v1 10 Apr 2001]. They argue that a model
in which links are continuously created between exist-
ing nodes explains the existence of two scaling regions in
their data. Vazquez investigated the citation network of
papers (nodes) and authors (links) for Phys. Rev. D and
found two scalings in its in-degree distribution. See A.
Vazquez, ArXiv:cond-mat/0105031 v1 2 May 2001.

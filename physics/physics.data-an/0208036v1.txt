Abstract

We examine a ﬁrst order diﬀerential equation with respect to time coming up in the description

of magnetic islands in magnetically conﬁned plasmas. The free parameters of this equation are

obtained by employing Bayesian probability theory. Additionally a typical Bayesian change point

is solved in the process of obtaining the data.

INTRODUCTION

Magnetic islands are structures appearing on resonant surfaces of plasmas in toroidal

magnetic conﬁnement devices. They have been found to limit the maximum achievable

energy which can be stored in a fusion plasma and may therefore be a problem for a future

reactor. Concepts of stabilizing the plasma in order to handle these instabilities include

electron cyclotron current drive which can only be useful if it is accurately adjusted to the

needed quantity. Therefore a thorough understanding of the island is necessary.

The time dependence of the magnetic island width W is theoretically described by the

generalized Rutherford equation [1]. This ﬁrst order nonlinear diﬀerential equation with

respect to time contains in our case three free parameters which have to be determined from

measured data since theoretical considerations can only provide estimates for these values.

They are assigned to three terms describing stabilizing and destabilizing eﬀects in the plasma,

i.e. the bootstrap eﬀect (with parameter aBS), the Glasser-Greene-Johnson eﬀect (aGGJ ) and

the polarization currents (apol). We use a simpliﬁed form of the Rutherford equation which
comprises the relevant dependencies on the parameters ~aT = (aBS, aGGJ , apol) only. The full

account of all physical constants and time dependent quantities may be found in [2].

pressure.

II. GENERATING THE DATA

The data is obtained from the so called Mirnov coils which are distributed poloidally

around the torus and measure any change of the poloidal magnetic ﬁeld. The time variation

dm/dt of the magnetic ﬂux m(t) through the Mirnov coil is proportional to the recorded

signal. We are interested in the time evolution of the amplitude m of the integrated signal

which can be connected to the magnetic island width W via

where mo is the oﬀset of the magnetic signal and b a proportionality constant. Additional

information about the absolute size of the magnetic island for a certain time comes from the

electron cyclotron emission (ECE) diagnostic. From this we know that WECE = 7cm within

a range of ∆ECE = 1cm. This information will be used later in setting up a prior.

A. Extracting the data from the Mirnov signal

The original signal from the Mirnov coils is shown in Fig. 1. A closer look (upper graph in

Fig. 2) reveals two kinds of structures: On the one hand peaks at intervals of approximately

3-5ms which are due to an edge plasma phenomena where energy and particles are expelled

out of the conﬁned region, and on the other hand the signal originating from the change

of the magnetic ﬁeld which shows sinusoidal behavior (interval approximately 0.08ms) with

an amplitude connected to the magnetic island width. This is the information we want to

extract. First one has to identify the positions of the peaky structures. Since the height

of the peaks is not everywhere larger than the highest amplitude of the sinusoidal signal

we can not simply look for all points which are higher than a certain level. Fortunately

the two structures live on two diﬀerent scales in frequency domain. Therefore we Fourier

transform (FFT) the complete data set and discard all the higher frequencies which refer to

the sinusoidal structure (see Fig. 2). Back transformation gives then a signal where peaks

are easy to identify. With the peak positions at hand we are set to go for the amplitude

of the sinusoidal structure in between two peaks. Again Fourier transformation is applied

where in addition we integrate over time and are ﬁnally left with the magnetic signal m

shown in Figs. 3 and 4 .

B. Finding the valid range of the model

The Rutherford equation (1) describes the dynamics of a magnetic island considering

certain plasma physics eﬀects. However, at the onset of the mode the magnetic island

is not stabilized and subjected to ﬂuctuations which are not covered by the model used.

We therefore have to identify the region in which the Rutherford equation is valid. Fig. 3

depicts the amplitude of the magnetic signal. The left part diﬀers from the right one where

the island has stabilized in amplitude and noise and we have to look for the certain time

FIG. 3: Amplitude of the magnetic signal of discharge #12238. After the onset of the magnetic

island the signal has not saturated and ﬂuctuates (left side). The analysis of the Rutherford

equation can only be performed for the stabilized part on the right side. The full line is the

posterior distribution for the change point Nc. The dashed line is a fourth order polynomial in the

respective regions.

incident tc = t(Nc) when the change of the behavior happens – a typical Bayesian change

point problem. Since we are out for the change point only we describe the time variation of

the amplitude of the magnetic signal by low order polynomials

For convenience we use matrix notation in the following, with matrix elements

}k−1,i = tk

and ~αT = (α0, ..., αK). The index < (>) denotes time points before (after) the change point.

III. LIKELIHOOD AND PRIOR

The measured quantity in Eq. (2) is the magnetic signal m with measurement uncertainty

ε. It is given in the form of a time series with N successive events, where we can write

Next step is the assignment of prior distributions for the conditional dependencies on mo, b,

the free parameters ~a and σ. Due to the above mentioned treatment of Fourier transforming

the data back and forth we loose any information about the actual scatter originating from

the measurement process. All we know is that a variance σ exists and that it functions like

a scale parameter – justiﬁed reasons for employing Jeﬀreys prior.

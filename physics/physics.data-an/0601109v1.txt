INTRODUCTION

Since its creation in 1966 by Hohenberg and Platzmann1, the Deep Inelastic Neutron Scattering

(DINS) technique was considered the most direct probe of the momentum distribution of nuclei in

condensed matter. The interest on this technique was further stimulated by subsequent develop-

ments, that showed that features attributed to the interference between the neutron and the proton
could be observed in experiments made on hydrogen2, thus determining the wave function of the

protons directly from the experimental data. The availability of this technique as a customary re-

search tool, opened in the last decade a new ﬁeld for the investigation in condensed matter, and

stirred up particular interest in the study of hydrogen dynamics, a topic for which this technique is

particularly suitable. Despite the main activity in the ﬁeld is held at Rutherford Appleton Labora-
tory (United Kingdom), contributions from different laboratories were also reported in the past3,4,5
and recently6,7,8,9.

The technique basically consists in an energy analysis carried out through the use of neutron

resonant ﬁlters in the range of a few electron-Volts, and it is based on pulsed neutron sources.

The spectra are recorded in time channels, which for the purpose of the study of momentum

distributions must be translated to a momentum variable, thus obtaining the so-called Neutron

Compton Proﬁle (NCP).

The theoretical basis of the technique was established by Sears10, who outlined the general
procedure that must be employed to arrive to the NCP from the experimental data. Later, Mayers11

established the conditions of validity of the usually employed approximations.

Recently, we re-examined the usual procedure to analyze the experimental data obtained from
this technique12,13, and and suggested improvements in the analysis of experiments involving light

nuclei14. In the cited reference, we showed that the method to obtain the momentum distributions

is, in general, a non-trivial task that involves a thorough knowledge of the different components of

the experimental setup. In particular, it is important to know the energy spectrum of the incident

neutrons, the detector efﬁciency, as well as an accurate description of the ﬁlter total cross section.

However, in the above mentioned work we did not examine the sample-dependent effects such as

multiple scattering and attenuation, which must be previously accounted for, before any analysis

is attempted. It is a very well-known fact that multiple scattering and attenuation effects can be

important even if all the reasonable cautions are taken in the sample design, since some low-signal
portion of the observed spectra could nevertheless be seriously affected15.

2

Multiple scattering corrections is a long-debated subject, and has been extensively treated in
the literature. Following the pioneering works of Vineyard16, and Blech and Averbach17, Sears

thoroughly established its theoretical basis18, stating the integrals that describe the contribution

of the n-th scattering process to the observed spectrum. The complexity of its solution was suc-
cessfully tackled by Copley19 who devised a Monte Carlo code, suited to a particular experimental

situation. However, Copley’s scheme could not be easily adapted to different kinds of experiments.

On the other hand, the common knowledge in neutron scattering technique teaches that speciﬁc
procedures must be devised for each particular experimental situation15,20.

Therefore, there is a primary need of a customary correction tool for multiple scattering and

attenuation effects in DINS experiments, that was only recently fulﬁlled. The authors have already

presented numerical results from a new Monte Carlo code compared with experimental results in

multiple scattering corrections in DINS experiments (see Refs.7,8,9), and recently Mayers et al.21

introduced the details of a new Monte Carlo code, related with the experimental setup thoroughly
described in Ref.22. The Monte Carlo procedure described in the mentioned work contains a

series of assumptions that were carefully analyzed in several publications. In the ﬁrst place it is

considered that the neutron has a well-deﬁned ﬁnal energy corresponding to the maximum of the
main absorption of the resonant ﬁlter. In a recent analysis23 we showed that such distributions

are far more complex than considering a single ﬁnal energy, and depends on the time channel
and the dynamics of the scattering species. The scattering angles in21 are generated considering a
random isotropic distribution. The validity of such assumption was investigated in Ref.24 showing

that the results obtained from such approximation deviate signiﬁcantly from the exact ones when

considering incident neutrons in the epithermal range. Another approximation contained in the

mentioned work the description of the total cross sections of the scattering system with a constant

plus a ‘1/v’ absorption scattering law, which can deviate signiﬁcantly from the real behavior when
considering molecular systems25.

In this paper we present the fundamentals of our Monte Carlo procedure to account for mul-

tiple scattering and attenuation effects. Account is taken of the experimental details such as the

energy spectrum of the incident neutrons, the resonant ﬁlter transmission and the efﬁciency of

the detectors bank. Regarding the sample, inelastic scattering is taken into account employing

suitable models for each analyzed case. The proposed model can be easily introduced as a double-

differential cross section, either analytical or numerically, so a complete description of the energy-

transfers and scattering angles are obtained. Experimental results of samples of different sizes are

3

shown, and the present code is benchmarked. The importance of an accurate model to describe the

neutron-sample interaction is stressed, and ﬁnally implications of multiple scattering corrections

on different situations are discussed.

II. BASIC FORMALISM

A basic description of the kind of experiments that we will analyze can be found in Ref.12, so

we will give only a brief account here. We will analyze the case a DINS experiment performed

in a pulsed source with an inverse-geometry conﬁguration, i.e. the resonant ﬁlter is placed in the

path of the neutrons emerging from the sample. A typical experiment consists of alternative ’ﬁlter

out’ and ’ﬁlter in’ measurements, whose difference gives the NCP in the time-of-ﬂight scale.

We deﬁne E0 as the incident neutron energy (characterized by a spectrum F (E0)), E its ﬁnal
the scattering angle.

III. MULTIPLE SCATTERING

In this section we will give an outline of the basic equations which govern the multiple scatter-

ing processes of n-th order, that are employed in the Monte Carlo programs. For a more detailed
treatment the reader is referred to15 and18.

We will suppose throughout this paper an isotropic sample. Let S(Q, w ) be the scattering law of

the sample, E0 and E the incident and ﬁnal neutron energies (being k0 and k their corresponding
the element of solid angle in the direction of the scattered neutron, s b the
wave vectors), dW
bound-atom scattering cross section of the sample (considered monatomic), and N the number of

scattering centers, then the double-differential cross section is

deﬁned as the average number of scattered neutrons with ﬁnal energies between E and E +dE, and

k and ¯hw = E0

E.

The integral of Eq. (3) over all angles and ﬁnal energies gives the microscopic total cross section
s (E0).

The above deﬁnition corresponds to the ideal textbook case where there is not multiple scat-

tering. Turning to the real case let us deﬁne the macroscopic double-differential cross section as

the probability that an incident neutron with a wave-vector k0 will emerge from the sample with a
wave-vector k18. In this deﬁnition we do not take into account neutrons non-interacting with the

sample (i.e. transmitted). Its expression thus reads

dW dE

4p A

k

s(k0, k),

where A is the cross-sectional area perpendicular to the incident beam. s(k0, k) is an effective

scattering function that admits a decomposition in a part due to singly-scattered neutrons in the

sample s1(k0, k), another due to singly-scattered neutrons in the container sC(k0, k), and a third

due to multiply scattered neutrons (with any combination of sample-container scattering events)

s(k0, k) = s1(k0, k) + sM(k0, k) + sC(k0, k).

The single scattering component s1 is simply related with the scattering law through the relation-

s1(k0, k) = Ns bS(Q, e )H(k0, k),

where H(k0, k) is the ﬁrst-order attenuation factor, deﬁned as the fraction of single-scattered neu-
trons that fail to leave the sample due to multiple scattering and nuclear absorption18 or that are

not detected due to the detector efﬁciency15. Expression (4) inserted into (2), gives the real NCP

including multiple scattering components. Its calculation, will normally involve a numerical sim-

ulation based on the Monte Carlo method.

IV. MONTE CARLO CODE

In this section we will describe the numerical simulation devised for DINS experiments. Its

fundamentals are based on Copley’s method19, and they are extensively developed in27 and28.

A. Neutron Histories

Neutron histories are generated with an initial unity weight. The incident neutron energy is

decided randomly using the experimental neutron spectrum as the probability distribution. The

ﬂight path x for a neutron with energy E is given by the probability

p(E, x) =

t(E, x)T (E, x)
T (E, d)
1

,

−
where the probability has been biased so the neutron never gets out of the sample27. In Eq. (7),

t(E, x) is the macroscopic total cross section of the sample-container set a distance x away from
the neutron previous scattering position, taken in the current ﬂight direction, T (E, x) is the fraction

of noninteracting (transmitted) neutrons in that direction after traversing a distance x, and d is the

distance to the sample surface in that direction. To compensate the bias in the probability, a weight

is assigned to each neutron which decreases according to the transmitted fraction in the traversed

considered path. A history is ﬁnished when the weight drops under a predetermined cut-off value,

so the number of scattering events is not predetermined.

The assignment of new energies and ﬂight directions is made via the use of model distributions

for the double-differential cross sections of the sample and the container environments, normalized

B. Scoring

At each step, the contribution of the current history to the detectors is calculated for each time-

of-ﬂight channel t. The ﬁnal energy E to be considered for this channel is obtained from15

where N is the number of scattering steps, and Li is the ﬂight path of step i, which was covered

with an energy Ei.

The quantity to be scored is the current weight, times the transmission factor from the cur-

rent position to the sample surface in the direction towards the detector position, times the ﬁlter

absorption ratio, times the detector efﬁciency

It can be shown15 that the average of zi after a large number of histories is the sought solution of

Eq.(2) for the case of a macroscopic sample (Eq.(4)).

C. Summary of input data

The above described Monte Carlo procedure, requires a detailed description of the experimental

setup and total cross sections of the involved materials. It also makes use of models for the scat-

tering laws to describe the sample and container interaction with neutrons. Here we summarize

the input data needed to perform it.

Incident spectrum as a function of energy.

•

•

Total cross section of the sample and the container materials as a function of the energy.

These data must be tabulated in an energy range wide enough to cover not only the energies

corresponding to the incident spectrum (epithermal energies), but also to consider the energy

transfers after a number multiple scattering steps (typically thermal energies).

V. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The experiments were performed at the Bariloche pulsed neutron source (Argentina). Neu-

trons, produced by the interaction of the electrons accelerated by the LINAC on a lead target, are

moderated in a 4 cm thick polyethylene slab. A cadmium sheet is placed in the incident beam, to

absorb thermal neutrons. The LINAC was operated at a 100 Hz rate. A collimated neutron beam

1 inch diameter was employed.

A schematic view of the of the DINS facility is shown in Fig. 1. A movable cylindrical

indium ﬁlter 0.25 mm thick, is placed in the ﬂight path of the scattered neutrons. The movement

is controlled remotely to perform alternative ’ﬁlter-in’ and ’ﬁlter-out’ measurements every 10
minutes. The detector bank consists of six 3He proportional counters (10 atm ﬁlling pressure,

6 inch active length, 1 inch diameter) placed at a mean scattering angle of 560. The detectors were

covered with cadmium cylinders to minimize the background due to thermal neutrons. The ﬂight-

path lengths were 504 cm (source-sample distance), and 27.5 cm (sample-detector) respectively.

The incident spectrum, measured employing a 3He detector placed perpendicularly to the direct

beam, is shown in Fig. 2 where the detector efﬁciency effect was accounted for. The detector bank

efﬁciency was determined through the ratio of the spectrum of scattered neutrons on a lead sample

36 Here we refer to the slow neutron regime, where the absorption cross section is inversely proportional to the neutron

velocity. See Ref.29.

benchmark on the numerical simulations, and they are not intended to represent optimized choices

in the experimental design. Finally we will show the importance of the present corrections in

thin samples, suitable for the experimentalists’ work. Numerical simulations were performed

employing the above mentioned Monte Carlo code, making use of the experimental parameters

mentioned in the previous section, and using total cross section data for the Indium ﬁlter from
Ref.30.

In Fig. 4 we show the results for the graphite samples, 3.54 cm diameter and 1 and 2 cm thick-

ness respectively. A typical error bar is indicated for each experimental dataset. The approximate

difference in count-rate (’ﬁlter out’ minus ’ﬁlter in’) at the peak maximum was 4 counts every

10000 LINAC pulses for the thin sample and 6 counts every 10000 LINAC pulses for the thick

one. Measurements were carried out in 4 million LINAC pulses for the thin and 2 million LINAC

pulses for the thick sample. Numerical simulations were carried out using a gas model for the

graphite. This is a good approach at epithermal energies like in this case, with the condition that

the temperature must be replaced by an effective temperature that takes into account the phonon

dynamics32. The resulting effective temperature is 61.2 meV calculated on the basis of a Debye
temperature of 1860 K31. In Fig. 4 we show the Monte Carlo results for the single and multiple

scattering components as well as the total one. Besides the main peak at about 315 µsec two extra

peaks at 200 and 130 µsec are observed, due to the resonances of 3.85 and 9.07 eV of Indium,

respectively. A good agreement is observed between the calculation and the experimental data,

showing that the multiple scattering component has a peak shape that is broader than the main

peak and is centered at lower times of ﬂight, thus contributing to a signiﬁcant distortion in the

observed total scattering. In the insets of Fig. 4 we show the attenuation factors (Eq. (6)), that

have to be applied to the observed proﬁle, once multiple scattering is subtracted.

In Fig. 5 we show the same results for the two samples of polyethylene 3 cm diameter and 1 and

2 mm thickness respectively, where typical error bars are shown. The approximate count rate at

the peak position was 5 counts every 10000 LINAC pulses for the thin sample and 7.5 counts every

10000 LINAC pulses for the thick one. Measurements were carried out in 5 million LINAC pulses

for the thin and 4 million LINAC pulses for the thick sample. For the Monte Carlo simulations
we employed the Synthetic Model25 with the parameters from Ref.33, which was successfully

employed to describe different integral magnitudes of the double-differential cross section. The

model adequately describes the interaction between the neutron and the sample in different energy

regimes, tending naturally to the commonly employed impulse approximation in the epithermal

region. Although the shape of the observed main peak due to hydrogen is less affected by multiple

scattering effects than in the case of graphite, it must be noted the distorting effect due to the

attenuation factor that varies a 25 % from 200 to 350 µsec thus affecting signiﬁcantly the long-

times tail of the Compton proﬁles.

The general trend of the multiple scattering behavior can be analyzed by observing the total in-

tensities observed in the main peak of the Compton proﬁles as a function of the sample thickness.

In Fig. 6 we show the integral intensity of the main peak for single, multiple and total scattering

obtained from Monte Carlo simulations at several sample thicknesses of graphite and polyethy-

lene. In the same graph we show the results obtained from our experimental data. In the case of

polyethylene, we measured a third sample 4 mm thick, that is not included in Fig. 5, but is shown

in Fig. 6. It is worth to mention that the results from the simulations were multiplied by a constant

(the same value in all the cases) in order to ﬁt the experimental data. In both systems, we observe

that the trend of the peak intensity as a function of the sample thickness can be correctly accounted

for only if multiple scattering processes are considered.

It is worth to emphasize the importance of a good description of the ﬁlter total cross section and

the detector efﬁciency. For that purpose we performed simulations assuming two different cases:

(a) a black detector (i.e. a detector with unit efﬁciency) and the ﬁlter described by the complete

absorption cross section;

(b) a ﬁlter described with a Lorentzian shape36, with the real detector efﬁciency.

In both cases commonly employed approaches are used. The results are shown in Fig . 7 and

in the inset the Lorentzian used to represent the ﬁlter together with the exact cross section30. We

observe that both assumptions are inadequate and affect both the single and the multiple scattering

components. In the case (a) the defect is manifested in an inaccurate description of the long-times

tail. On the other hand, in (b) we observe an incorrect description in the short time region and the

long-time tail, is mostly unaffected. It is worth to discuss the reason for both behaviors. The long-

times region of the observed proﬁle is mainly composed by emerging slow neutrons, which are

absorbed by the ﬁlter according to the above referred ’1/v’ behavior. In the case of a black detector

(a) our system is sensitive to those neutrons, while in (b) and our detectors are covered with

14

s
cadmium cylinders, whereby our detection system is insensitive to such neutrons. Both behaviors

are observed in the calculated curves in Fig. 7, while experimental data only marginally illustrate

the effect due to experimental errors.

Finally, it is worth to mention that in common practice, the experimentalist will choose an ad-

equate sample size in order to minimize multiple scattering effects, while keeping an acceptable

signal-to-noise ratio. To illustrate the multiple scattering and attenuation effects on samples suit-

able to the experimentalist, we present in Fig. 8 the results of our Monte Carlo program for thin

sample thicknesses of graphite and polyethylene of the same diameters as presented in Figs. 4 and

5. In the upper frame we show our results for graphite (1 mm thick). We observe that although

the multiple scattering contribution is small, it is non negligible, and it will have to be properly

computed if accurate values of the peak-shape parameters are to be obtained from the experiment.

Special attention must be payed to the attenuation factor, that still has an appreciable variation over

the range of times of interest. The reason is that H(k0, k) in Eq. (6) contains not only the attenua-

tion in the sample (negligible for a thin sample) but also the fraction of detected neutrons (detector

efﬁciency effects). In the case of polyethylene, we show the results of a 0.15 mm thick sample.

The multiple scattering effect is barely visible, but the attenuation factor has also an appreciable

variation over the range of interest, thus affecting the observed peak shape.

VII. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Throughout this paper we examined different aspects that affect multiple scattering and at-

tenuation effects in DINS experiments. We presented a Monte Carlo procedure that adequately

describes Multiple Scattering and attenuation processes in DINS experiments. To attain a good

agreement between the numerical simulations and the experimental data, accurate descriptions of

the incident neutron spectrum, the detector efﬁciency as a function of the energy and the ﬁlter total
cross section were necessary. These considerations add up to those stated in Refs.12,13, regarding

the need of a good description of the experimental setup and the inadequacy of the convolution

approximation in the description of the neutron Compton proﬁles. It must be remarked the impor-

tance of an accurate description of the efﬁciency of the detector system. As such, we understand

the detecting setup that comprises the kind of detectors employed, the geometry and the materi-
als involved. For instance, the detector system employed in this work is composed by 3He tubes

covered with cadmium, that result in the efﬁciency shown in Fig. 3. The importance of the knowl-

The same notation as in Fig. 4 applies. Insets: attenuation factors

edge of the detector efﬁciency as a function of the energy can be understood in the light of the
recent work on the analysis of ﬁnal energy distributions in DINS experiments23. As a result of this

analysis it was concluded that at every time of ﬂight a distribution of ﬁnal energies is operative

in the neutron Compton proﬁles, instead of a single well-deﬁned energy as is usually assumed
in the customary data processing procedures21. As a consequence is is not sufﬁcient to assume a

detector operative at a single energy (in which case the knowledge of the efﬁciency function would

be irrelevant), but the behavior of the efﬁciency function is essential, as conﬁrmed by the results

presented in Fig. 7.

The results presented on Multiple Scattering effects should be considered when designing a

DINS experiment. In the analyzed graphite samples, the multiple scattering components have a

signiﬁcant structure that affect the shapes of the neutron Compton proﬁles. In the case of polyethy-

lene, multiple scattering contributes with a ﬂat background, but on the other hand the attenuation

factor has a signiﬁcant variation over the time range of interest. This is a consequence of the sub-

stantial variation of the efﬁciency function of our detection system in the range of energies shown

in Fig. 3.

From the analyzed examples, we conclude that a wise choice of the sample thickness is still a

valid rule, taking into account that a good contrast between ‘ﬁlter-out’ and ‘ﬁlter-in’ positions is

required. Even if the sample sizes are adequately chosen, multiple scattering and/or attenuation

corrections will necessarily have to be considered. The case of Fig. 8 is illustrative. Even if the

multiple scattering contribution is small, the correction due to the attenuation factor can still be

important (as shown in our case), given that it also includes the detectors’ efﬁciency correction15,

which in our case has an appreciable variation with the energy. In general this result will depend

on each particular detection system. All the considered cases show the need to perform accurate

multiple scattering, attenuation and efﬁciency corrections. To this end numerical simulations are

the most adequate procedure. In this paper we presented a suitable correction tool, for which an ex-

perimental benchmark with samples considerably affected by these corrections was satisfactorily

performed.

These corrections will normally have to be taken into account before proceeding to the data

analysis, i.e. obtaining the kinetic energy distributions of the atoms, peak areas, etc. Particular

importance will have the corrections in the analysis of lighter nuclei. Monte Carlo simulations on
heavier nuclei not shown in this paper21 reveal that the multiple scattering component tends to be

located below the main peak and it is roughly proportional to it, thus having negligible distortion
effects on its shape. This consideration must be brought together with those mentioned in Ref.12

regarding the extreme care that must be exercised when analyzing light nuclei with the DINS

technique.

36 A Lorentzian centered at 1.457 eV and full-width at half maximum of 0.2016 eV was employed. This

value is greater than the one found in the literature34 (0.075 eV at 0 K) due to the ﬁnite temperature of

the ﬁlter. The peak shape at ﬁnite temperature is not a Lorentzian but a peak described with the Lamb

equation35 , that is broader due to the Doppler effect.

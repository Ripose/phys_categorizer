Abstract

We present a method for the decomposition of mass spectra of mixture gases using Bayesian

probability theory. The method works without any calibration measurement and therefore applies

also to the analysis of spectra containing unstable species. For the example of mixtures of three

diﬀerent hydrocarbon gases the algorithm provides concentrations and cracking coeﬃcients of each

mixture component as well as their conﬁdence intervals. The amount of information needed to

obtain reliable results and its relation to the accuracy of our analysis are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Mass spectrometry is a standard technique for residual gas analysis and active processing

control in vacuum devices. Traditional low resolution quadrupole mass spectrometers are

widely used due to high sensitivity, reasonable stability, wide operational pressure range,

high scan speed and low costs. To be ﬁltered in the quadrupole ﬁeld, neutral gases have

to be ionized ﬁrst, most commonly by electron impact. At a typical electron energy of

50-100 eV used to achieve a high ionization eﬃciency and stability analyte molecules can

decompose into a variety of fragment ions leading to the so called cracking pattern(CP).

The fragmentation is a molecular speciﬁc property which reﬂects the chemical structure and

the atomic composition of the molecule. It can therefore be used for the decomposition of

multicomponent mass spectra.

A direct decomposition of mass spectra from mixture gases by successive subtraction

of component contributions from the mixture signal, the wide spread pedestrian approach,

works only if there are non-interfering mass numbers. A more elaborate method, least square

evaluation, is not subject to this limitation and can incorporate measurement errors into the

analysis[1, 2]. In both cases one must assume the CP of the components to be exactly known

[1]. The CP is, however, not an intrinsic property of molecules but depends on the particular

mass spectrometer and operating parameters making the determination of CP nontrivial.

The problem becomes even more severe if unstable species like radicals are among the

components of a mixture, since in this case there are neither calibration measurements nor

literature values for the CP available. In case of mixtures containing a single radical the

CP of the radical is usually identiﬁed with the rest signal after subtraction of all component

signals from the mixture signal. Because of the error propagation of measured signals the

above procedure, however, provides only poor and sometimes unphysical (e.g. negative

cracking coeﬃcients) estimations.

To overcome these diﬃculties and to treat measured spectra consistently we introduced

a novel method using Bayesian probability theory [3]. This was applied to the pyrolysis of

azo-methane in order to evaluate concentrations and improved cracking coeﬃcients together

with their conﬁdence intervals for the pyrolysis products including the methyl radical. In the

present work we deal with another case of decomposition, in which mixtures made up given

diﬀerent compositions have to be decomposed without using any calibration measurements.

2

Because of lack of calibration measurements this method oﬀers a practical use, in particular,

in handling unknown mixture gases. But most importantly, this approach is able to treat

mixtures containing unstable species, because exact CPs are not needed.

As an example we synthesize mixtures of three diﬀerent hydrocarbon gases, ethane(C2H6),

propane(C3H8) and n-butane(C4H10). The gas composition and the cracking coeﬃcients of

the mixture components will be estimated by independent experiments and compared with

the results from the Bayesian analysis.

II. BAYESIAN DATA ANALYSIS

The procedure used in this work is similar to that used for the decomposition of the

pyrolysis products of azo-methane introduced by Schwarz-Selinger et al. [3], where details

of the calculation may be found. Here we present only the relevant steps for our algorithm.
Assuming linear response of the mass spectrometer the mass signal ˜dj of a mixture is the

sum of contributions of all species in the mixture

˜dj = ˜C˜xj + εj

,

(1)

where j = 1, ..., J with J mixtures. The vector ˜dj has N elements representing the same

number of mass channels. The composition vector ˜xj has the dimension M of the number
of species in the mixture. ˜C is a cracking matrix with M column vectors corresponding to

the cracking patterns of M species. Since we are interested in compositions and cracking
patterns but not in the absolute intensities, ˜dj and the column vectors of ˜C are normalized

with respect to the sum of intensities of all mass channels for practical reasons, which enforces

in turn the normalization of ˜xj

where ˜xmj is the m-th component of the j-th mixture. This sum rule has been overlooked

in our previous work [3]. The results in Ref. 3 approximate however closely the sum rule.
Quite the same it does improve stability of the estimates on ˜x and ˜C if the relation is
explicitly included in the analysis. The vector εj in Eq. (1) represents the ﬁnite noise of the
experiments. We assume that εj is bias free,

nj.
Note that for the absolute composition of the mixtures ˜xj in (1) has to be scaled by a

independent calibration experiments. Since it is beyond the scope of this work it will not

be discussed. In the following we call ˜xj concentration of a mixture.

Now we can make use of the normalization condition (2) and reduce the number of

unknown concentrations by 1. We split ˜C˜xj in Eq. (1) into two parts

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

All mass spectra presented in this work were taken with a quadrupole mass spectrometer

(Hiden, HAL 201), which has the standard axial ion source and the secondary electron

multiplier (SEM) for ion detection. The mass spectrometer chamber with a base pressure
10−9hPa is diﬀerentially pumped and connected with the main chamber by

better than 1

a capillary (φ 1 mm, 10 mm long). Both chambers are pumped with a separate turbo

molecular pump. The gas ﬂows into the main chamber are controlled by three individual

MKS ﬂow controllers (type 1259C), which allow a nominal error of 0.8 %. During calibration

as well as mixture measurements the pressure in the mass spectrometer chamber was kept
10−8hPa to minimize any pressure eﬀect on the cracking patterns.

Fig. 1 depicts the mass signals of 6 mixtures of diﬀerent gas compositions composed of

ethane, propane and n-butane for the most intensive 14 mass channels. Note the strong

similarity of the six spectra. The quoted ratio was determined from the gas ﬂows into the

main chamber and does not reﬂect the actual concentrations, since the gas ﬂow through

8

the capillary as well as the pumping power in the main and the mass spectrometer chamber

strongly depend on species. However, they still may serve as a crude estimate of the mixture

ratio.

The upper part in Fig. 2a shows calibration measurements of C2H6, C3H8 and C4H10

together with their literature values taken from Cornu and Massot [6]. The cracking co-

eﬃcients are normalized with respect to the sum of the intensities, so that they all have

the total intensity of one making the direct comparison of cracking patterns from diﬀerent

sources possible. Although the rough structures of CP from literature and calibration mea-

surements for the three gases look very similar, nearly every peak shows a clear deviation

between calibration and literature values. This is actually expected since the CP depends on

the geometry of ion sources, analyzer transmission and mass dependent secondary electron

multiplier gain reﬂecting the speciﬁcation of a particular mass spectrometer. The lower plots

in Fig. 2a show the results of the Bayesian analysis on the mixture data in Fig. 1. The

agreement of CP between calibration and our analysis is very good. For ethane the Bayesian

results coincide exactly with those from the calibration, and for propane and butane only

few points show a small deviation, namely peaks at m=28 and m=29, 43, respectively. But

this deviation means not necessarily an error in the measurements or analysis. In contrast,

it is conceivable that CP of pure gases is changed in a mixture by an inﬂuence of gases

on each other through a simultaneous presence in the ion source or by variation of partial

pressures [8].

Fig. 2b shows the concentrations of the components in six mixtures from the Bayesian

analysis and from the independent estimation by pressure measurement. For the latter the

partial pressure of known gas ﬂows of pure gases was measured by a baratron gauge, which

is mounted in the main chamber, and the ﬂux rate of a mixture was rescaled to partial

pressures of each gas. The error of this estimation was assessed to 10 %, which is mainly

contributed by the long-term ﬂuctuation of the total pressure and the tolerance of the ﬂow

controller. Our results in Fig. 2b are in a satisfactory agreement with the estimation by

pressure measurement and rather accurate with about 3 % conﬁdence interval. It can also

be found that there is a systematic deviation between the two sources: the concentrations

from the pressure estimation for ethane are lower than those from our analysis and the

concentrations for butane show exactly the opposite. This may be explained by the mass

dependent conductance through the capillary [9], which connects the mass spectrometer

9

and the main chamber with the gas inlet system. Since the conductance of the capillary

is larger for ethane than for butane, the estimations by the baratron have to be increased

for ethane and decreased for butane, which leads to a better agreement between the two

determinations. In fact, the determination of the composition of a mixture is rather diﬃcult

and needs much care. A gaseous molecule in a mixture can aﬀect the molecular kinetic of

other gases and thus the pressure reading of pure gases cannot be directly combined with the

mixture composition. If no calibration of pure gases is available as in the case of radicals,

the pressure determination is even impossible. Our method in this case provides a unique

way to yield concentrations of all components in the mixture.

The accuracy of Bayesian analysis relies on the amount of information provided, which

include prior knowledge, number of measurements or the availability of calibration measure-

ments. It is therefore interesting and important to ask how much information or how many

data sets we need to obtain reliable results from the equation system (7). A single mixture

delivers 13 known and 2 unknown parameters (14

1 for dj and 3

1 for xj due to the

−

−

normalization), while the number of unknown cracking coeﬃcients (=30) is unchanged. For

the latter mass numbers with no signiﬁcant signal compared to the background noise are

neglected. For the analysis with 3 mixture data, for example, the number of known and

unknown parameters are 39 and 36, respectively, illustrating an overdetermined equation

system. This consideration, however, is only valid if the input data are linearly indepen-

dent. Our data by no means meet this condition, as can be seen qualitatively in Fig. 1.

Quantitatively, the signiﬁcant singular values of the SVD of the data matrix gives the num-

ber of sources, which eﬀectively contribute to solving the equation system. For the data

matrix with six column vectors only three singular values are signiﬁcant (Table 1) indicat-

ing that at least six data sets would be needed for the reliable decomposition of the mixtures

by the purely mathematical treatment. In contrast, for the Bayesian approach each data set

contributes to increase the accuracy of the analysis on the basis of prior knowledge. As can

be seen in Fig. 2, six mixtures were proved to contain enough information to decompose the

mixtures. Let us now reduce the input data down to three mixtures. In Fig. 3 the results

from three data sets are compared to those from six data sets. The point estimations of the

cracking coeﬃcients are nearly unchanged, but the error bars became somewhat broader,

which seems to be reasonable because of less information. The concentrations derived from 3

and 6 mixtures also show no signiﬁcant change. These very satisfactory outcomes from three

10

mixtures would not be possible by directly resolving the equation system (7). It should be

also noted that the analysis with two mixture data illustrating a superior number of unknown

parameters leads to a strong uncertainty in the estimation of both cracking coeﬃcients and

concentrations.

We can also even increase the accuracy by adding calibration measurements to our anal-

ysis. Fig. 4 shows the results deduced from 7 data sets including the 6 mixture data and the

calibration measurement for butane. One can see that the deviation of cracking coeﬃcients

at m=29, 43 for butane shown in Fig. 2a entirely vanishes and that the overall error signif-

icantly decreases. This demonstrates that the incorporation of calibration measurements is

an eﬃcient way to improve the accuracy of our analysis. This may be possible even for very

unknown mixtures, since in most cases one can infer from the source of mixture gases one

or more of its components.

IV. SUMMARY

We introduced a method for decomposition of multicomponent mass spectra using

Bayesian probability theory, which was used to derive concentrations and cracking coef-

ﬁcients of mixture components as well as their conﬁdence interval without any use of cal-

ibration measurements. For synthesized mixtures from ethane, propane and butane the

algorithm was able to deliver precise results, which were compared with independent esti-

mations. This example exhibits a very challenging case, in which the mass spectra of the

mixtures show only a moderate diﬀerence from each other. Since the number of available

mixture data does not restrict the application of our method but merely aﬀects the accuracy

of the analysis, even cases in which limited number of mixtures is available can be processed

by our Bayesian approach. For unknown mixtures, if only few components are assumed to

be known from the source of the mixtures, the outcome of our analysis for the concentrations

serves as a critical criterion to decide whether a certain species is among the constituents of

the mixture.

Future applications include the decomposition of neutral particle ﬂuxes from low temper-

ature hydrocarbon plasmas including larger radicals employed in thin-ﬁlm deposition and

etching. The radicals are believed to play an crucial role in ﬁlm formation at the plasma-

surface boundary [10, 11]. Their quantiﬁcation, which will be possible by the present method,

11

is therefore prerequisite for understanding of the microscopic ﬁlm growth process. In this

case mixture data are easily available, e.g. by variation of plasma parameters [10].

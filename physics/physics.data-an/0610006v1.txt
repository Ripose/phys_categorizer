Abstract

The vast majority of sampling systems operate in a standard way: at each tick of a ﬁxed-

frequency master clock a digitizer reads out a voltage that corresponds to the value of some physical

quantity and translates it into a bit pattern that is either transmitted, stored, or processed right

away. Thus signal sampling at evenly spaced time intervals is the rule: however this is not always

the case, and uneven sampling is sometimes unavoidable.

While periodic or quasi-periodic uneven sampling of a deterministic signal can reasonably be

expected to produce artifacts, it is much less obvious that the same happens with noise: here I

show that this is indeed the case only for long-memory noise processes, i.e., power-law noises 1/f α

with α > 2. The resulting artifacts are usually a nuisance although they can be eliminated with a

proper processing of the signal samples, but they could also be turned to advantage and used to

encode information.

INTRODUCTION

Nearly all digital signal-measuring equipment found in laboratories throughout the world,

from the humble voltmeter up to powerful computerized data-logging systems and high-

frequency digitizing scopes, operate with an internal master clock that sets the pace for an

analog-to-digital converter that translates the electrical output of a transducer into a bit

pattern. The master clock frequency is usually held as stable as possible and the sample

intervals are ﬁxed to a very high degree of precision. Correspondingly, most signal-analysis

techniques are meant to be used on evenly spaced data: this is true for the Discrete Fourier

Transform (DFT) and also for Autoregressive (AR) or Moving Average (MA) modeling of

data [1]. However some data happen to be unevenly sampled: this is especially true for

astronomers, who are seldom so lucky as to have an uninterrupted series of clear nights,

and in general are bound to observe whatever comes from the sky, whenever it comes, and

have to search for periodicities amid these scattered data. Indeed it was the astronomical

community that developed the ﬁrst eﬀective spectral estimation techniques for unevenly

sampled data [2].

Uneven sampling has special properties: Beutler proved rigorously [3] that in general

uneven sampling is not band-limited and later showed that a random, Poisson-distributed

set of sampling times allows perfect signal reconstruction [4]. Earlier, Yen [5] was able to

derive modiﬁed forms of the Shannon reconstruction formula for diﬀerent types of uneven

sampling, which are however much more complex than the corresponding formula for even

sampling. And indeed, randomly sampled signals are not easy to analyze and many standard

methods must be abandoned, although in some cases one can restore regular sampling using

reconstruction algorithms [6].

Since no sampling clock is quite perfect and is normally aﬀected by noise [7] and by

deterministic drifts (that may be periodic), all regular sampling should actually be regarded

as quasi-regular sampling. Ignoring this may be dangerous, because it is clear that quasi-

regular sampling of a deterministic signal (e.g. a sinusoidal signal) may introduce unwanted

harmonics in the DFT analysis of the sampled signal, unless corrective measures are taken.

But what happens if one samples pure noise? Can one still produce artifacts? If this were

the case then an unrecognized quasi-regular sampling of a noisy background might become

a problem since it would produce fake signals that could be mistaken for true. In this paper

2

I show that this is just what happens in some cases of colored noise, i.e., in the case of the

long-memory noise processes 1/f α with α > 2, while the correlation between samples for

noises with α

2 is insuﬃcient to produce replicas of the low-frequency peak of the noise

≤

spectrum. A proof is given in section II, while section III illustrates numerical results that

conﬁrm the theoretical analysis, and section IV discusses some implications of these ﬁndings.

II. PROOF BASED ON A DFT MODEL OF THE NOISE PROCESS

It is well known that a signal sampled N times in the time interval (0, T ) can be modeled

by a sum of N exponentials and that this is equivalent to a DFT: in other words the DFT

is a physical model of the signal [1] and we can write:

where fn denotes the n-th sample, and the ﬁt coeﬃcients Fk correspond to the DFT and

can be calculated from the formula

With the usual regular sampling intervals ∆t, the n-th sampling time is tn = n∆t, the total

sampling time is T = N∆t, and equation (1) can be rewritten as follows:

fn =

Fk exp

If sampling is not quite regular, the sampling times tn are replaced by tn +∆tn, and equation

Now we assume a periodic sampling pattern with a period equal to M clock ticks, so that

N = mM and M

show that this requirement can be relaxed and m can be real) and we expand the relative

and in addition, we assume the relative timing shifts to be very small, i.e., ∆tn/∆t

we notice that k/N < 1, and then, using equations (4) and (5) and after a few cumbersome

(the hypothesis of phase independence is quite common, because it is essential for noise

generators like that of Timmer and K¨onig [8], and is supported by the numerical results

reported in [9]).

If the noise is white, i.e., the spectral density is ﬂat, or if it is a 1/f α noise with a spectral

index α

2, we see from eq. (7) that the periodic uneven sampling amounts to the addition

of a (small) non-ﬂat background. In fact a 1/f α noise has a discrete spectrum Sk

However, if the spectral index α is greater than 2, then the l-th harmonic of the relative

time shift ∆tn/∆t produces a peak over the power-law background, which is just the low-

frequency noise peak, shifted to the (ml)-th frequency bin.

III. NUMERICAL SIMULATION

The analysis that leads to eq. (7) assumes small relative timing shifts, but in this section I

report numerical simulations carried out with the exact power-law noise generator described

in [9, 10, 11] that do support the analytical results also for large relative timing shifts [12].

The generator used in the simulation runs produces power-law noise from a superposition

of random exponential pulses, and is exact in the sense that it produces a process that is

theoretically guaranteed to yield a range-limited power-law spectrum between two extreme

(angular) frequencies λmin and λmax. The generator takes correctly into account the cor-

relation between samples in colored noises, and works also with unevenly spaced sampling

times.

In these simulations, time is in arbitrary units, and the average sampling interval is

∆t = 1 arb. units; the choice of time units also sets the corresponding frequency units

used for the relaxation rates λmin and λmax. Figure 1 shows a simulated signal obtained
with the noise generator for a 1/f 3 noise; in this case the generator parameters are α = 3,
λmin = 0.0001, and λmax = 1, i.e., the spectrum has a power-law region 1/f 3 that spans the
10−1, and the pulse rate has been set at n = 10 pulses

frequency interval 1.6

10−5 < ω < 1.6

·

per unit time, so that the resulting noise signal is Gaussian to a very high degree [9]. In

this case the sampling time has been sinusoidally modulated: ∆tk/∆t = 1 + 0.2 sin(2πk/4)
(the period for uneven sampling is 4 samples), and there are in all 220 = 1048576 samples.

Figure 2 shows the DFT spectrum of the signal of ﬁgure (1): a comparison with the exact

theoretical spectrum of the noise generator [10, 11]

– which has a 1/f α power-law in the range λmin < ω < λmax – shows that on the whole

the sampled noise process produced by the noise generator actually behaves as predicted by

theory [9, 10, 11], except for a small peak at the frequency of the sampling time modulation.

This small peak only shows up in this and in other runs (not shown here, but easily repro-

ducible [12]) with α > 2, and this lends support to the proofs of the previous sections. The

spectra shown in this and in the other ﬁgures have been partly detrended with a Hanning

window (a general introduction to the need of the detrending step can be found, e.g., in [14];

5

see also the qualitative considerations in [16, 17]).

A closer look at the modulation peaks yields however a much more striking conﬁrmation

in fact the theoretical spectral density (9) of the noise generator
of the analytical results:
has a 1/f α power-law region for λmin < ω < λmax, while for ω < λmin it has a 1/f 2 behavior,

and this means that from equation (7) we expect that the correction term due to uneven

sampling is negligible just at the modulation frequency, while there should be two side-

peaks whose exact shape depends on the low-frequency limit of the 1/f α region, i.e., on

λmin. And indeed this is just what happens in the simulations, as shown in ﬁgure 3, where

part a. shows the region of the averaged spectrum in ﬁgure 2b close to the peak due to

sampling time modulation. Figure 3b shows the expected behavior calculated from equation

(7) and from the conditions used in the generation of the noise process and listed above (the

correction for the incoherent gain of the Hanning window is also included). Finally, ﬁgure

3c is the superposition of parts 3a and 3c, where we see that the calculated shape closely

matches the observed shape.

Figure 4 shows the results of a similar calculation performed on the spectrum of a single

realization of the noise process shown in ﬁgure 2a: ﬁgure 4a is the zoomed portion of the

spectrum around the modulation peak. Figure 4b is a still closer zoom, and the arrow in

the ﬁgure shows the position of the modulation frequency: notice that there is no peak

just where one would naively expect to ﬁnd one. The low frequency part of the spectrum

in ﬁgure 2a has been inserted in equation (7) to obtain the spectrum in ﬁgure 4c, and we

see that there is an almost perfect correspondence with the peak in ﬁgure 4c: this means

that the correlation terms between diﬀerent frequencies (the cross-terms in the derivation

of equation (7)) are negligible even for a single realization of the noise process.

I have also noted that there must be a dependence of the split-peak shape on the exact

shape of the low-frequency part of the spectrum: ﬁgure 5a shows the shape of the peak for a
larger value of λmin (λmin = 10−3). In this case the low-frequency part of the noise spectrum
(9) has a wider 1/f 2 region, and the side-peaks must be correspondingly lower and further

apart: indeed this is just what happens in ﬁgure 5a. A further conﬁrmation is provided by
10−5): the side-peaks

ﬁgure 5b, which shows the peak for a smaller value of λmin (λmin = 5

·

are much higher and also closer.

IV. DISCUSSION

While most of the observed power-law (1/f α) noises have spectral indexes 0 < α

2, with

≤

an apparent clustering around α = 1, red noises, i.e., noises with spectral indexes α > 2, also

show up in several unrelated systems [16, 17] like the water level of the Nile river, economics,

orchid population size [18] and local temperature ﬂuctuations and aﬀect precise timekeeping

[19] and our ability to predict environmental and animal population variables [20]. Noises

with α > 2 also appear in the energy level ﬂuctuations of quantum systems [21, 22] and in

timing noise in pulsars [23]. Because of their extreme peaking behavior at low frequencies

these noises are also called “black” [17], and they display marked persistence properties [16]

that may lead to the mistaken identiﬁcation of underlying trends in experimental data [24].

From the results reported in this paper it follows that these noises pose yet another potential

danger to experiments that use uneven sampling, because their long-memory properties give

rise to artifacts in the DFT spectra.

However equation (7) also shows that the single peak – in the case of true 1/f α noise

– or the side-peaks – in the case of range-limited 1/f α noise – can be modulated both in

amplitude and in frequency by modulating either the noise spectrum or the relative timing

shift amplitude, or the repetition index m: this means that uneven sampling of colored noise

could be utilized to encode information, and since an encoding noise appears at ﬁrst sight

just ordinary noise, this could be used to implement a secure communication channel (there

is a very rich literature on this topic, but here I give only a reference to a classic book

[25] and to a recent paper [26]). A simple example of the kind of modulation that can be

achieved can be gleaned from ﬁgures 3, 4 and 5: if one uses the noise generator [9, 10, 11], it

is possible to modulate the shape of the low-frequency part of the spectrum with a proper

change of λmin and in this way one modulates in turn both the amplitude and the position,

i.e., the frequency, of the side peaks.

FIG. 1: This ﬁgure show a noise signal produced with the generator described in [9, 10, 11].

The parameters in this speciﬁc run are α = 3, λmin = 0.0001, and λmax = 1, i.e., the spectrum
has a power-law region 1/f 3 that spans the angular frequency interval λmin < ω < λmax. The

generator produces power-law noise from a superposition of random exponential pulses, and in

this run the pulse rate has been set at n = 10 pulses per unit time, so that the resulting noise

signal is Gaussian to a very high degree [9]. Time is in arbitrary units, and the average sampling

interval is ∆t = 1 (arb. units); the choice of time units also sets the corresponding frequency units

used for the relaxation rates λmin and λmax. The sampling time has been sinusoidally modulated:
∆tk/∆t = 1 + 0.2 sin(2πk/4), and the signal has been sampled 220 = 1048576 times. Part a. shows

the whole signal generated in this run (time does not start from zero, because at the beginning

some samples are used for the generator initialization and are discarded); part b. shows the initial

32768 valid samples. Notice that even though the sampling time modulation is rather large (20%),

it is quite invisible in the zoomed ﬁgure.

ωN = πνS is the (angular) Nyquist frequency and νS is the sampling frequency. b. Spectrum aver-

aged over 16 realizations of the same noise process: the solid line shows the expected (theoretical)

behavior of the noise spectrum [10, 11], corrected for the incoherent gain of the Hanning window

that has been used for trend removal. The upward bend at high frequency in the spectrum b is

due to aliasing which becomes apparent after averaging, while the upward bend at low frequency

is due to the uncorrected DC component which cannot be removed by windowing.

FIG. 5: This ﬁgure illustrates how the peak splitting changes for diﬀerent noise shapes: a.) In

this case the noise generation parameters are the same as for the signal in ﬁgure 1, except for

the lowest relaxation rate λmin = 0.001, and the ﬁgure shows the averaged spectrum zoomed and

centered on the position of the small peak. The softer low-frequency behavior in noise spectrum

produces side peaks that are smaller and further apart than those shown in ﬁgure 3. The solid line

shows the expected behavior, calculated as in ﬁgure 3b b.) A smaller value of the lowest relaxation

rate, λmin = 0.00005 yields instead much closer and higher side peaks. Once again we see that the

calculated shape (solid line) matches very well the observed shape. Because of the much narrower

splitting, the scale in part b is expanded with respect to a to improve visibility.

Abstract

We study a scenario under which variable step random walks give anomalous statistics. We

begin by analyzing the Martingale Central Limit Theorem to ﬁnd a suﬃcient condition for the

limit distribution to be non-Gaussian. We note that the theorem implies that the scaling index ζ

is 1

2 . For corresponding continuous time processes, it is shown that the probability density function

W (x; t) satisﬁes the Fokker-Planck equation. Possible forms for the diﬀusion coeﬃcient are given,

and related to W (x, t). Finally, we show how a time-series can be used to distinguish between

these variable diﬀusion processes and L´evy dynamics.

INTRODUCTION

Under which conditions can statistics of stochastic processes be anomalous? Such statis-

tics have been observed in temperature and longitudinal velocity ﬂuctuations in highly turbu-

lent ﬂuid ﬂows [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], instantaneous velocities of gusting winds [6] and price variations

in ﬁnancial markets [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Furthermore, in the case of ﬁnancial markets, it has

been noted that the probability density functions exhibit self-similarity [7, 8]. In prior work,

L´evy statistics [13, 14, 15] and hierarchical processes [16] have been suggested as possible

causes of anomalous behavior. In this paper we suggest an alternative scenario where, in

contrast to L´evi processes, stochastic increments have uniformly bounded variance and are

not independent.

General conditions for the validity of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) are given for

martingales, which are deﬁned in Section II. We discuss how the limit distribution can

fail to be Gaussian, and provide a set of conditions that give non-Gaussian statistics. In

Section III, we argue that the corresponding probability density W (x; t) for continuous time

W (x; t) = 1

processes satisﬁes the Fokker-Planck equation [19, 20] and scales with index ζ(= 1

2); i.e.,
√t. By using the Fokker-Planck equation, we show that the
diﬀusion coeﬃcient D(x; t) for the process takes a speciﬁc form. It is shown that a reduction

√t F (u), where u = x

of D(x; t) to a form D(u) preserves all statistical features of the stochastic process. Given

D(u), we then provide an explicit expression for F (u). As examples, we provide forms

for D(u) that give exponential and power-law distributions for F (u).

In Section IV, we

provide a criterion that can be used to distinguish these newly introduced variable diﬀusion

processes from L´evy statistics. Previous analysis of ﬂuctuations in ﬁnancial markets appear

to contradict the L´evy mechanism.

Throughout the paper, we will relate our results to turbulent ﬂows and ﬁnancial markets

to illustrate implications of our assertions. However, it should be emphasized that our work

is a theory of neither of these systems.

gales. We describe the setup only for the case of interest to us.

We consider a random walk (on the real line) starting at x0 = 0, with steps denoted by

ε = (ε1, ε2, . . . ). The step εk can depend on its history (i.e., the previous (k

1) steps).

We ﬁrst provide a necessary and suﬃcient condition to obtain Gaussian statistics.

Lemma: If the random variables Z and η satisfy Eqn. (9), then Z is Gaussian if and only

if η2 is a constant.

Indeed, if η2 is constant, say σ2, then Z has characteristic function exp

therefore it is normally distributed with variance σ2. Conversely, if Z has mean zero and

implies, upon diﬀerentiating with respect to s and setting s = 1, that

E[gn] = σ2n for all n.

Thus η2 is constant (Theorem 3.11 of Ref. [18]).

Next, we identify a set of conditions that gives anomalous statistics for un. Condition (3)

of the martingale CLT is satisﬁed if increments εk have a variance bounded uniformly in n
(i.e., there exists a c > 0 such that for all k, V ar [εk] = E [ε2

What remains is to ﬁnd martingales that satisfy condition (2) where η2 is not a constant.

If εk’s are independent and identically distributed with ﬁnite variance σ2, then from the
classical CLT η2 = σ2 in probability. Once εk’s are allowed to be history dependent, the

conditions for convergence of (

ε2
k/n) becomes non-trivial, as illustrated by the following
example: consider a stochastic process with independent steps, consisting of N1 steps from

P

a distribution with ﬁnite variance σ2

1, followed by M1 steps from a distribution with ﬁnite

variance σ2

2, followed by N2 steps from the ﬁrst process, M2 steps from the second, etc. For

5

suitable choices of N1 ≪
converge. Convergence of η2 requires more stringent conditions on the stochastic process.

. . ., η2 moves between σ2

2, and fails to

1 and σ2

M1 ≪

M2 ≪

N2 ≪

For processes introduced in the next section, the distribution of η2 is not a δ-function, as

shown in the Appendix.

We conclude this section with the following observations. First, we reiterate that once

the conditions of the martingale CLT are satisﬁed, un = xn/√n converges to a distribution
F (u); i.e., the scaling index ζ is 1

2 . Second, in contrast to L´evy processes, increments εk
are not independent. Further, for the examples we consider, the εk’s satisfy Eqn. (10) (at

least, according to the numerical simulations). Note however that the conditional variance,

V ar

ε(n)

εn+1|

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

, is not required to be uniformly bounded.

III. CONTINUOUS MARKOV PROCESSES

In order to study continuous processes, divide the interval t into subintervals of δt and

let n = t/δt; it is assumed that δt is suﬃciently large for many martingale increments

to occur in this interval. Now, let εk’s denote the martingale increments in intervals δt.

In order for the variance of increments in 1 unit of time to be uniformly bounded, it is

necessary and suﬃcient (see the ﬁrst Lemma) that 1

δt V ar [εk] be uniformly bounded; i.e.,
be uniformly bounded. A priori, the limit Z may depend on the particular

that V ar

discretization used. For the examples given below, this is not the case, although we have

Note that the terms in ¯D(u; t) that contain c1(t) and c2(t) do not change the form of
W (x; t). Hence, they will not be considered in the remainder of the paper; i.e., only the
t-independent part of ¯D(u; t), henceforth denoted D(u), will be considered.

Thus, suitable choices of D(u) can give exponential or power-law behavior in F (u). Note

that, in the ﬁnal example α < 1 is needed in order for the condition (10) to be satisﬁed.

We have conﬁrmed numerically that stochastic dynamics with diﬀusion coeﬃcients given

in these examples give probability density functions consistent with the analytically derived

expressions. These computations were conducted by integrating the (zero-drift) Langevin

equation dX = [D(X(t); t)]1/2

(0, dt) [23]. The integrations are done using Ito calculus;

N

i.e., it is assumed that each step in the integration consists of a large number of stochastic in-

crements and that variations in D(X(t); t) during the interval can be ignored. Consequently,

the deviations in a time interval δt lie on

(0, √Dδt).

IV. DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN L´EVY AND VARIABLE DIFFUSION PRO-

CESSES

Given a stochastic process

such that xn lies on a scalable, non-normal distribution, is

εk}

{

it possible to determine if L´evy or variable diﬀusion processes are the more likely source of the

dynamics? More precisely, is it possible to eliminate one of the scenarios as the underlying

cause of the observed stochastic dynamics? One possible criterion is to test if the variance of

the stochastic process is ﬁnite (variable diﬀusion) or inﬁnite (L´evy). However, it is diﬃcult

to make this determination from a ﬁnite time series. An alternative is to use the fact that

while successive movements of a L´evy process are independent, those in the variable diﬀusion

case depend on the location and time of the walk. For example, if D(u) increases with

u

(as

|

|

in the examples above), then large movements are likely to leave xn (and hence D(u)) large;

FIG. 1: Examples of 10,000 steps from a (a) L´evy distribution with ζ = 2/3 and (b) variable

diﬀusion process with D(u) = 2(1 + u2). Unlike in (a), a large ﬂuctuation in (b) is generally

followed by movements with higher amplitude.

consequently, a large ﬂuctuation can generally be expected to be followed by additional

(positive or negative) large increments. L´evy processes with independent increments will

not exhibit such correlations. Dynamics of L´evy and variable diﬀusion processes, shown in

Figure 1, illustrates the diﬀerence.

Thus, one may consider distinguishing variable diﬀusion and L´evy processes using the

auto-correlation function of a time series. However, since the mean value of the increments

is zero in for each case (since they are martingales), the auto-correlation will vanish. On

the other hand, auto-correlation function of

(n) will only vanish for the L´evy case.

are unlikely to be the source of scalable non-Gaussian distributions in ﬁnancial markets.

V. DISCUSSION

The theory we have presented is not merely a reformulation where an observed scal-

able probability density function W (x; t) is recast into a suitably chosen diﬀusion coeﬃcient

D(x; t). Rather, it introduces a new class of stochastic dynamics. Unlike L´evy processes,

the increments considered in our work, although Markovian, are not independent. In addi-

tion, they have ﬁnite variances. The scaling index for scalable diﬀusion processes takes a

unique value ζ = 1

dynamics takes the form 1

2. The probability density function W (x; t) for continuous time stochastic
√t F (u) and satisﬁes the Fokker-Planck equation. The diﬀusion
coeﬃcient can be chosen to be a function of u, and there is a correspondence between F (u)

and the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D(u).

The fact that successive events are independent in L´evy processes and only martingales in

our variable diﬀusion processes implies that dynamics can be used to identify which model

is more suitable to represent a given time series of stochastic events. We propose the use of

the auto-correlation of ε2

k’s as such a test. Previous studies of ﬁnancial markets suggest that
they consist of increments that are not independent, and hence suggest that independent

L´evy processes are unlikely to be the correct explanation for the observed non-Gaussian

probability density functions [22].

The need for x-dependent diﬀusion coeﬃcients implies that the stochastic dynamics is

not invariant under translations in x. In particular, for the examples given earlier, the origin

is both the starting point of the walk as well as the location where D(x; t) is minimized. In

ﬁnancial markets, one does expect any sudden large ﬂuctuation in the price of a stock to

be followed by a period of high anxiety in the part of traders; consequently the stock can

be expected to trade at a signiﬁcantly higher rate. This is equivalent to an increase in the

diﬀusion rate. However, if the price of the stock settles at this new value, it is likely that the

location of the minimum in D(x; t) will move towards it. Thus, a more realistic model of

ﬁnancial markets would involve a coupled variation of the price of the stock and the location

of the minimum of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient [24].

A time-dependent, but x-independent drift µ(t) of the stochastic process can be intro-

duced by including a “drift” term

µ(t)W (x; t) on the right side of the Fokker-Planck

equation [20]. Redeﬁning u to be 1

When the diﬀusion coeﬃcient is a function of u, the martingale sums may fail to lie on

a normal distribution. We have chosen processes where E

is uniformly bounded,

so that conditions (1) and (3) of the martingale CLT are satisﬁed. Hence, the random

variable Z is not distributed normally because (1/n)

ε2
k does not approach a constant (in
probability) for large n. We illustrate this failure with two examples of discrete random

The distribution of η2 for a ﬁnite-step martingale with D(u) = 1 +

u

is shown in Figure

2(a). Since D(u)

1 for all u, η2 is non-vanishing only when the argument is larger

≥

than 1, where it decays exponentially. As expected from the analysis, F (u) is found to be

walks.

Next, consider a martingale with D(u) = (1 + tanh

u

). For a ﬁxed t, D(u) varies

|

|

between 1 and 2, and for a ﬁxed x, it reduces to 1 with increasing t. The histogram of η2,

computed numerically for a set of 100,000 random walks of length 100,000, converges to the

function shown in Figure 2(b). Since 1

D(u)

2, η2 is non-zero only in the interval [1, 2].

The corresponding probability density function W (x; t) has the form 1

is not Gaussian.

In contrast, if the diﬀusion coeﬃcient is chosen to be (1 + tanh

1 + tanh (1/√t)

, η2 is found to be constant, and W (x; t) is found to approach a Gaussian.

We investigate a network-based dynamical process called Naming Game, which allows a multi-
agent system to converge towards a consensus state in a self-organized way. We study the con-
vergence mechanism for interacting agents embedded in small-world networks and ﬁnd that the
dynamics resemble a coarsening process which is inﬂuenced signiﬁcantly by the typical size and the
clustering coeﬃcient of the underlying network: the smaller typical size and clustering coeﬃcient
cause the faster convergence; the larger clustering induces the smaller memory. Both numerical
certiﬁcations and analytical explanations are provided to support these conclusions.

INTRODUCTION

The ﬁeld of so-called semiotic dynamics has recently
become a topic of extensive interests[1, 2]. This ﬁeld
studies the origination and evolution of conventions in
a group of individuals and concerns about whether and
how the system can converge from an initial dissension
to a ﬁnal consensus. A recently proposed model called
Naming Game[3] applies itself to describe this conver-
gence process. The original model of Naming Game was
constructed by Steels and colleagues in a well-known ar-
tiﬁcial intelligence experiment called Talking Head[4]. In
the primary experiment, humanoid robots observed the
ambient objects via their digital cameras, and assigned
them new names. It is certiﬁed by the experiment that,
under certain rules, the system will drive itself to a con-
sensus state which is characterized by a shared lexicon
among robots, without any human intervention, i.e. the
system can converge towards a state of consensus in a
self-organized way.
In this paper, we focus on a spe-
cial model of Naming Game proposed by Baronchelli and
Implemented over complex net-
colleagues[5] recently.
works, this model prescribes a set of dynamical rules,
under which agents or nodes are supposed to negotiate
with each other to reach a consensus state. This dynam-
ics has recently gained special attentions from physicists
because it simulates a non-equilibrium dynamical behav-
ior of a complex adaptive system, and enable the sys-
tem to self-organize towards an special attractor via local
interactions. Former works on Naming Game had per-
formed it over some representative network topologies
such as fully connected graph[5, 6], regular lattice[7], the
WS networks[8, 9], and the so-called random geometrical
graph[10].

Recent works[11, 12, 13] on complex networks had re-
vealed that the dynamical processes are aﬀected signiﬁ-
cantly by the underlying topological structure, however,
how the topology of the network works on Naming Game
has not been particularly discussed yet. In this paper,
we focus on this issue and study the Naming Game on
small-world networks. We ﬁnd that the dynamics resem-
ble a coarsening process which is inﬂuenced signiﬁcantly

by the typical size and the clustering coeﬃcient of the
underlying network: the smaller typical size and clus-
tering coeﬃcient cause the faster convergence; the larger
clustering induces the smaller memory. Both numerical
certiﬁcation and analytical explanation are provided for
our conclusions.

MODEL

The model proposed by Baronchelli and colleagues
recently[5] captures the essential properties of current
dynamics:
it allows the system to converge towards a
consensus state in a self-organized way. To keep the pa-
per as self-contained as possible, we review the model
brieﬂy. The model includes a set of agents embedded in
a certain network. Two nodes are allowed to negotiate
with each other if they are connected. For the sake of
simpliﬁcation, there assumed to be only one objects in
the environment and words are then invented by nodes
to denominate this object. Each time step, nodes act
under following rules:

(1)a node is randomly selected from the network to

play the role of a “speaker”;

(2)from the speaker’s neighbors, another node is ran-

domly selected to play the role of a “hearer”;

(3)the speaker then randomly picks up a word, if any,
from local vocabulary and send it to the hearer; if the
speaker’s vocabulary is empty, the speaker invents a new
name for the object, stores it in local vocabulary and
send it to the hearer;

(4)when receives a word from the speaker, the hearer
search its own vocabulary to check whether it has al-
ready possessed the received word, if it has, the negotia-
tion will be deemed as a successful one, and both hearer
and speaker will delete all the other words in their vo-
cabularies; otherwise, i.e. if the negotiation is failed, the
hearer will add the new received word into local vocabu-
lary without deleting any other words.

This process continues until there is only one word left
on the network. It is obvious that at the beginning of
the dynamics, the whole community holds a variety of
diﬀerent invented names, however, it is certiﬁed that,

after enough steps of local interactions, the whole system
will eventually share an exclusive word.

Network topology adopted here is the so-called homo-
geneous small-world networks(HoSW) proposed recently
by Santos et al[14]. Slightly diﬀerent from the origi-
nal process, we started from a regular ring with periodic
boundary condition. Each of the networks’ N nodes ini-
tially connected to its K nearest neighbors. The proce-
dure begins as walking clockwise around the ring through
all the one-ordered edges, saying edges that connect a
vertex to its nearest neighbors; each time we stay on a
certain edge, with a probability p, we exchange it with
a edge randomly chosen from edges that have not been
exchanged before. The traverse will keep going on until
one lap ﬁnished. Afterward, we begin to move around
through the secondly ordered edges, that is edges con-
nect a vertex to its next nearest vertex. Just as we had
dealt with the ﬁrstly ordered edges, with a probability
p, we exchanged the edge we are travelling on with an-
other randomly chosen edge. This process continues until
all the edges are visited once. Naturally, we forbid any
self-edges and multi-edges.

The reason we use this network model is that dur-
ing the process of edges exchanging, degrees of vertices
keep constant[15], thus, after the whole procedure of net-
work reconstruction, each agent still keeps contact to K
neighbors, therefore we avoid the inﬂuence on the dy-
namical process from the network’s degree distribution
and degree deviation. Moreover, with the increase of
exchange probability p, the topology of the network dis-
plays a WS model liked properties[14], concretely speak-
ing, high clustering coeﬃcient and small average distance
are obtained at small p, and a dramatic decrease of clus-
tering coeﬃcient when p reaches the order of 0.1. How-
ever, it is worth emphasizing that network topologies in
idiographic problems may diﬀers from each other, the
reason we adopted HoSW network is that, as mentioned
above, it is able to aﬀord an eﬀective quantitative change
of concerned topological parameters, and further more
eliminate the inﬂuence of unconcerned ones.

NAMING GAME ON HOSW NETWORKS

In this section, based on the model mentioned above,
we investigate how dynamical property of Naming Game
responses to the change of network topology, which is
induced by regulating network size N and rewiring prob-
ability p. However, each network used are sharing the
same degree K = 8. All results average over 5000 real-
izations.

As for the topological parameters, we have special em-
phasis on clustering coeﬃcient, which has been proved to
be a dominating factor that aﬀects the dynamical pro-
cedure. The exact deﬁnition of clustering coeﬃcient is
C = 1
N P Ci, where Ci = 2ei/ki(ki − 1). ei here is the

gree of node i; thus Ci in fact measures the probability
of two neighbors of node i arbitrarily chosen out being
allowed to communicate with each other.

Before discussing how the underlying topological struc-
ture works on the dynamics of Naming Game, a general
situation of the evolution should be sketched. From a
global viewpoint, we pay attention to the total mem-
ory n(t), the total amount of words over the network at
the step t. Figure 1 shows the time evolution of n(t),
rescaled by network size N . One can observe that, in
the early stage of the dynamics, words are invented out
by agents, and begin to propagate over the whole net-
work, indicated by an increase of n(t) to a maximum
M which is proportional to network size N . After a de-
crease from the maximum, the behavior of n(t) is sepa-
rated into two distinct periods by a crossover time tcross.
The former period witnesses some preponderant words
engulﬁng puny ones, and at the same time aggrandiz-
ing their own inﬂuences; after this period of elimination,
only a limit number of fortunate words survive and im-
mediately, competition among these predominant words
presents in the second period. This competition persists
until the convergence time tcon, when the ﬁnal winner of
the competition eventually takes up the whole network,
and declares the convergence of the system.

From the viewpoint of a single word, however, the be-
havior of the current dynamics can be seen as a coars-
ening liked process[7, 10]. Considering that any isolated
member of the largest word will be engulfed quickly, we

FIG. 2: (Color Online) The size of the largest cluster g(t) as
a function of time over networks of diﬀerent sizes. Rewiring
probability p = 0.1. Time step is rescaled by network size
N . The ﬁrst section of the dynamics witnesses a power-law
increase of the largest cluster, and slopes of the curves are
observed to be equal to each other (approximately we have
γ ≃ 0.7), indicating that coarsening rate is independent of
network size N .

use g(t), the amount of the most predominant word at
step t, to illustrate the coarsening behavior, instead of
using a geometrical agglomerate. The process of conver-
gence can be deemed as the aggrandizing of g(t) from
a node to the whole network. Figure 2 and 3 display
g(t) as a function of time based on networks diﬀer from
each other in size or rewiring probability. A crossover
time separates the whole dynamics into two sections as
mentioned above, and before the crossover time when the
maximal cluster reaches the typical size of the network,
a power-law coarsening behavior of g(t) is observed. The
typical size of the network can be considered as a func-
tion of network size and the rewiring probability therefore
can be denoted as ℓ(N,p). Exscinding the early inventing
period persisting a time about N , and requiring g(t) to
reach the order of 1 when each node has been statistically
chosen once, one can write

FIG. 3: (Color Online) Time series of g(t) on networks of

clustering coeﬃcient and a smaller γ.

sharing a ﬁxed size induces diﬀerences of the coarsening
rate, as indicated by Figure 2 and 3, respectively. Thus
the factor aﬀects the coarsening rate can be considered
to be sensitive to p while independent of N .
Inspired
by the pioneer work which had testiﬁed that the clus-
tering coeﬃcient plays a signiﬁcant role of impeding the
epidemical propagation behavior over networks[16], we
argue that the clustering coeﬃcient is also a dominat-
ing factor that inﬂuences the dynamics of the Naming
Game. In the context of current dynamical process, for a
larger clustering coeﬃcient(implying a smaller p), which
implies more triangular loops embedded in the network,
and therefore stronger restriction against the aggrandize-
ment of the words, the coarsening rate γ will be smaller;
and at the same time, due to a smaller p, the typical size
of the network will be larger, both are responsible for an
increase of the crossover time.

While at a ﬁxed rewiring probability, considering the
small world eﬀect of the network, one can suppose
ℓ(N,p) ∼ ln(N ), and thus we have

g(t) ∼ (t/N )γ,

(N < t < tcross)

(1)

tcross ∼ N (ln(N ))

with γ indicating the coarsening rate and being deter-
mined by network topologies. Further more, considering
that g(tcross) ∼ ℓ(N,p), we have

tcross ∼ N (ℓ(N,p))

1
γ

(2)

A qualitative indication about how network topology
works on the coarsening rate γ is also provided by Figure
2 and 3. Networks with diﬀerent sizes and equal rewiring
probabilities reﬂect on the same coarsening rate γ and the
distinction in the rewiring probabilities of the networks

In the case of Figure 2, we obtain the approximal value
γ ≃ 0.7, this educes tcross ∼ N (ln(N ))1.43. At ﬁxed
p, simply assuming the convergence time to be propor-
tional to the crossover time, one has tcon ∼ N (ln(N ))1.43.
When rescaled by this factor, the convergence time on
networks of diﬀerent sizes are expected to be close to each
other. Figure 4 shows the numerical result via the con-
vergence of nd(t). The convergence time is reached when
there is only one word left in the network, i.e. nd(t) = 1.

Besides the dynamical time t, the maximal memory

FIG. 4: (Color Online) Amount of diﬀerent words nd(t) as
a function of time. Networks adopted here share a unique
p = 0.1 and diﬀer from each other in network size N . The
system converge to a consensus state when a victories word
eventually dominate the whole network. After being rescaled
by a theoretical factor N (ln(N ))1/γ (1/γ ≃ 1.43), the conver-
gence time of these systems of diﬀerent sizes are close to each
other.

FIG. 5: (Color Online) Relationship of Si and Ci at tmax.
Network size N = 2000, and p is regulated to obtain diﬀerent
clustering coeﬃcient distributions. For each rewiring proba-
bility p, 20 networks are independently used, and on each of
these networks, 5000 times independent simulations are per-
formed. Each time when t = tmax the local successful rates
of nodes are recorded as a function of their local clustering
coeﬃcients. A linear positive correlation between Si and Ci
is revealed, with the a slope a ≃ 0.35 and a constant b ≃ 0.20.

M is another meaningful dynamical parameter, which
can be deemed as a measurement of the minimal memory
space each agents should provides at least. Here we argue
that, base on the HoSW model, M is aﬀected primarily
by the network size N and the clustering coeﬃcient C.
Assume tmax to be the time n(t) reached its maximum,
according to the dynamical procedure, after an average
over independent simulations, the change rate of n(t) can
be expressed as:

dn(t)
dt

2n
N

= −S(t)(

− 2) + 1

(4)

where S(t) denotes the successful rate, saying the proba-
bility of the negotiation of step t being a successful one.
And, when n(t) reaches the maximum, we have:

Further more, one obtains:

dn(t)

|tmax= 0

M =

)

Assume ∆i to be the vocabulary of node i at step tmax,
and εi to be vocabulary size of node i, i.e. εi = |∆i|. For
arbitrary j ∈ ∆i, suppose that among node i’s neighbors,
there are ηj nodes that also possesses word j. We can
then deﬁne the local successful rate as

Si =

X ηj

1
εiki

(5)

(6)

(7)

Using Si, and noting that the choosing of the speaker
from the community and the choosing of the words from
the speaker’s vocabulary are both equiprobable, the suc-
cessful rate of step tmax can be expressed as

S(tmax) =

1
N X Si

(8)

In the early stage of the evolution, the dynamical pro-
cess can be considered as a propagation of diﬀerent kinds
of invented words, and the behavior of the dynamics can
be deemed to be aﬀected primarily by local topologies.
As mentioned above, the neighborhood of a particular
node with a larger clustering coeﬃcient is correspond-
ingly more accomplished in circumscribing the word’s
propagation. Thus it is reasonable to expect that in
the early stage, nodes with larger local clustering coeﬃ-
cients may have their words shared by their neighbors in a
higher degree, which immediately indicate that each time
when the dynamics reaches tmax, the local successful rate
of node i is then required to have a positive correlation
with the local clustering coeﬃcient. Figure 5 shows a
numerical simulation based relationship between Si and
Ci at tmax, a linear positive correlation between Si and
Ci is suggested. Despite slight diﬀerences of the slopes
of diﬀerent networks, for the sake of simpliﬁcation, we
suppose si = aCi + b for all cases, where a and b are con-
stants that involve the factor of degree K, and moreover
according to the numerical simulation, we have a ≃ 0.35
and b ≃ 0.20 as their approximate values. Using this sim-

sults αp=0.01 = 1.74 and αp=0.1 = 2.02. Figure 7 shows
how clustering coeﬃcient works on the minimal memory
each agent should hold, with a comparison between ana-
lytical results and numerical studies.

CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

In this paper, through performing Naming Game on
homogeneous small-world networks, we investigate how
network structures inﬂuence the dynamical process of
Naming Game. We ﬁnd that clustering coeﬃcient and
the typical size of the network are two major factors
determine the essential properties of current dynamical
model:
larger clustering coeﬃcient impedes the spread-
ing of invented words, and the typical size of the network
provides a turning point which indicates the changing
of local spreading behaviors of some predominant words
to a global aggrandizing behavior of a ﬁnal winner. We
proposed a quantitative relationship between clustering
coeﬃcient and the maximal memory, and a approximate

estimate for the convergence time. However, degrees of
nodes may also play an important role in aﬀecting the
converging procedures, the discussion on the relationship
between topology and dynamics is not yet complete. The
exact role of the average degree and the degree distribu-
tion of the network in the context of Naming Game is one
of the most interesting concerns in later works. In fact,
considering the local successful rate proposed above, one
can suppose that larger degree induces lower successful
rate and thus larger maximal memory, and once involve
the factor of degree, the expression of the maximal mem-
ory may become more complicated.

Further more, as a non-equilibrium mechanics of a
complex adaptive system, the Naming Game not only
can be used to describe the evolution of semiotic relation-
ships, it also provides a characterization for the spreading
of opinions or communication languages [17, 18] among
a set of interactional agents who negotiate with each
other to reach a consensus state.
It is worth empha-
sizing that, due to the diﬀerent situations of adopting
domains, Naming Game is therefore supposed to have
diﬀerent details,[6, 10, 18], which, however, are all re-
quired to capture the essential property of this dynamics
as Baronchelli model do: enable the system to drive itself
to a consensus state without any external or global coor-
dination. The discussion about these diﬀerent details in
diﬀerent backgrounds can also be an interesting topic in
future works.

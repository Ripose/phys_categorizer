Abstract

Testing symmetry of a probability distribution is a common question arising from
applications in several ﬁelds. Particularly, in the study of observables used in the
analysis of stock market index variations, the question of symmetry has not been
fully investigated by means of statistical procedures. In this work a distribution-free
test statistic Tn for testing symmetry, derived by Einmahl and McKeague, based
on the empirical likelihood approach, is used to address the study of symmetry of
ﬁnancial returns. The asymptotic points of the test statistic Tn are also calculated
and a procedure for assessing symmetry for the analysis of the returns of stock
market indices is presented.

1 Introduction
The gain/loss asymmetry of stock price variations is considered as one of the
stylized facts of ﬁnancial time series [1] and its nature is of great and current
interest [2]. In particular, and even though it has been researched for many
years, the study of the symmetry of the unconditional distribution of ﬁnancial
returns remains as an important subject. For instance, in reference [3] condi-
tions under which the distribution of ensemble returns becomes asymmetric

are reported. On the other hand, [4] has analized returns of a big sample of
diverse ﬁnancial indices without ﬁnding important symmetry deviations.
Then, due to the importance of this subject, the assumption of symmetry
of the distribution of returns should be supported by means of objective
distribution-free statistical procedures.
In next section of this paper, we present and review a distribution-free test
statistic Tn for testing symmetry, derived by Einmahl and McKeague [5], based
on the empirical likelihood approach. In section 3 we show our numerical calcu-
lation of the asymptotic distribution of the Tn statistic derived by simulation in
[5]. In section 4 we present a procedure for assessing symmetry of returns dis-
tribution by using the statistic Tn and illustrating it with data of the Mexican
Stock Market Index IPC (´Indice de Precios y Cotizaciones or by its English
meaning Prices and Quotations Index) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average
Index DJIA.

2 The Tn Statistic
An approach to omnibus hypothesis testing based on the empirical likeli-
hood method has been published in a very interesting paper by Einmahl
and McKeague [5]. For testing the null hypothesis of symmetry about zero,

3 Calculation of the Asymptotic Distribution of Tn
The asymptotic percentage points of the limiting distribution of Tn were ob-
tained here using (see for example [6]) the series representation:

where ν1, ν2, . . . are independent chi-squared random variables, with one degree
of freedom, and λ1, λ2, . . . are the eigenvalues of the integral equation:

with σ(s, t) denoting the covariance function of the process

W (t)
√t .

Due to the diﬃculty of solving analytically equation (3), the asymptotic per-
centage points of the distribution of Tn were found numerically; using k = 100
equally spaced points in the interval (0, 1) the integral was approximated in
order to solve equation (3). Similarly, a k by k grid on (0, 1)
(0, 1) was con-
structed to evaluate the covariance function σ(s, t) and the eigenvalue problem
solved to estimate λ1, . . . , λk. Using these approximations, the asymptotic per-
centage points were calculated using Imhof’s method [7]. The above procedure
was repeated for k=200 and k=300, and the results compared. As it can be
seen from table 1, the percentage points obtained are almost identical except
for a few discrepancies not greater than one unit in the third decimal ﬁgure.
These results are consistent with those obtained by simulation and reported
in Einmahl and McKeague’s paper.

4 Proposed approach and examples
Given a set of observations from an unknown probability distribution, if the
symmetry point is known, a statistical procedure (as the one described above)
can be used to test the symmetry of the distribution around that point. How-
ever, when the symmetry point is unknown, it might happend that the test
would lead us to the rejection of this assumption, even when the distribution
is symmetric; this would be the case when the symmetry point is incorrectly
speciﬁed in the test.
log St−∆t
St
Let us denote by
its returns or logarithmic increments during a certain time interval ∆t. The
“shifted returns” are also deﬁned as Rt(c) = Rt
c, where c denotes a real
number. Finally, let us denote by Tn(c) the value of the test-statistic Tn cal-
culated from R1(c), . . . , RN (c) for a particular value of c.
In the following, we will mean by a plausible value of the symmetry point,
(for a signiﬁcance level α) any real number c0, such that Tn(c0) < T (α) where
T (α) denotes the α

the stock index process and by Rt = log St

Table 1
Asymptotic percentage points of Tn calculated numerically. It can be seem from two
columns values that numerical convergence of Tn is very fast.

Using a similar approach to that of constructing conﬁdence regions, a plot of
Tn(c) versus c can be used to identify a plausible set of values of the unknown
symmetry point c in the sense that, for a given signiﬁcance level α, the interval
would contain the set of all possible values of c which would not lead to the
rejection of the null hypothesis of symmetry for the probability distribution
of the random variable Rt.
In order to illustrate the procedure, we present our analysis for two data sets:

(1) DJIA Daily closing values from October 30, 1978 to October 20, 2006.
(2) IPC Daily closing values for the same period.

For each data set, the shifted returns Rt were obtained, and the plots produced
using the procedure described above.
In ﬁgure 1, it is shown the plot from the Dow Jones index data, including the
lines y = 4.909, y = 2.983 and y = 2.200, which correspond to the asymptotic
0.99, 0.95 and 0.90 percentiles of distribution of the Tn statistic, from table
1. As it can be seen, for a signiﬁcance level α = 0.10 (or lower), it is possible
to ﬁnd an interval of plausible values for the unknown point of symmetry
which would not lead us to the rejection of the assumption of symmetry.
Approximately, for α = 0.10, any value within the interval (2.6

of the returns is symmetric.

for the unknown point of symmetry; that is, if we choose any value for the
symmetry point within that interval, the statistic Tn would not lead to the
rejection of the hypothesis of symmetry around the choosen point. Again, our
assessment would be that, for a given signiﬁcance level α = 0.10 (or lower),
there exists a set of plausible values for which the assumption of symmetry
can be statistically supported.

It must be remarked that the approach discussed here is not equivalent to
that of maximizing a test-statistic as it has been the case, for example, in
[8] or [9] and [10]. The reasoning behind our assessment is based on the idea

that whenever there exists a plausible value for the point of symmetry, this
assumption can be statistically sustained.

5 Conclusions
A procedure for assessing the assumption of symmetry, for the probability
distribution function of returns, has been presented. The approach is based
on determining, statistically, whether or not, a set of plausible values for the
unknown symmetry point can be found. Two examples were discussed to il-
lustrate the approach, analyzing returns data from the Dow Jones and the
Mexican IPC stock market indices. In both cases, sets of plausible values for
the point of symmetry could be found, so that that the assumption of sym-
metry can be statistically supported.

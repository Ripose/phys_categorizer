An exact formula for the distribution of lifetimes in coherent-noise models and related models
is derived. For certain stress distributions, this formula can be analytically evaluated and yields
simple closed expressions. For those types of stress for which a closed expression is not available,
a numerical evaluation can be done in a straightforward way. All results obtained are in perfect
agreement with numerical experiments. The implications for the coherent-noise models’ application
to macroevolution are discussed.

Agents under externally imposed stress have been re-
cently studied in coherent-noise and related models [1–7].
These models display scale free distributions in a number
of quantities, such as event sizes and lifetimes, or in the
decay pattern of aftershocks. Coherent-noise models are
very diﬀerent from other models displaying scale free be-
havior, such as sand pile models [8], as they do not rely
on local interactions or feedback. Hence, they are not self
organized critical. Considered the abundance of power-
law distributed quantities in nature [9], models such as
the ones of the coherent-noise type can help understand-
ing to what extent self-organized criticality is the right
paradigm for describing driven systems, and to what ex-
tent other mechanisms can provoke similar power-law dis-
tributions.

Despite the simplicity of the original coherent-noise
model—agents have thresholds xi; if global stress exceeds
a threshold xi, agent i gets replaced; with prob. f , an
agent gets a new threshold—, no exact analytical results
have been obtained so far. The distributions of event
sizes and aftershocks have been studied in detail in [3]
(event sizes) and in [10] (aftershocks). Both distributions
can be regarded as being well understood. Nevertheless,
the theoretical results are only of approximative charac-
ter in both cases.

In the case of the distribution of lifetimes, there are
even less theoretical results. Sneppen and Newman [3]
have given an expression based on their time-averaged
approximation. This expression is right for certain
stress distributions, as we will show below. However, it
breaks down for slowly decaying distributions such as the
Lorentzian distribution. Moreover, it is not clear when
exactly it can be applied.

In a recent paper [7], a diﬀerent approach of calculat-
ing the distribution of lifetimes has been taken, and the
author claimed that the lifetimes obey multiscaling, with
a L−2 decrease for small lifetimes, and a L−1 decrease
for large lifetimes. Here, we will demonstrate that this
statement is wrong. We will calculate the distribution
of lifetimes exactly, without any approximations, and we

will show that our results are in perfect agreement with
numerical simulations.

Our calculations are based on the observation that it is
not necessary to know the distribution of thresholds ρ(x)
for calculating the distribution of lifetimes. All we have
to know is the distribution according to which agents
enter the system, which is called pthresh(x) in the nota-
tion of [1], and the stress distribution pstress(x). Once an
agent has entered the system, it has a well deﬁned life ex-
pectancy, which is closely related to the probability that
the agent will be hit by stress or mutation. Note that
in this picture, we are considering only a single agent.
Therefore, if we talk about lifetimes, it does not mat-
ter whether the stress acts coherently on a large number
of agents, or whether it is drawn for all agents indepen-
dently. In this respect, the results we obtain in this work
are of a much more general nature than the results found
previously for event sizes or aftershocks.

An agent with threshold x will survive stress and mu-
tation in one time step with a probability p(x) equal to [5]

In the second step, we have assumed that the threshold
distribution is uniform. This can always be achieved af-
ter a suitable transformation of variables [3]. Hence, we

rived in [3]. The correcting term vanishes with f . It is of
importance only for extremely long lifetimes of the order
1/f , for which it modiﬁes the detailed cut oﬀ behavior.
In Fig. 1 we display Eq. (12) together with results from
direct numerical simulations, for diﬀerent values of f .
The theoretical result is in perfect agreement with the
measured distributions. The dependency of the cut oﬀ
on f is clearly visible in Fig. 1.

Another stress distribution for which we can derive a
closed analytic form for h(L) is the uniform distribution,

coherent-noise model with uniform stresses is not a power
law [3]. A plot of Eq. (14) is given in Fig. 2, together with
the corresponding measured distribution.

For the most other stress distributions, the integral in
Eq. (7) can only be done numerically. This is the case,
for example, for the Gaussian distribution, pstress(x) =
x2/(2σ2)]. Under Gaussian stress, an
agent with threshold x will survive a single time step

Here, g(L) is the probability density function for the life-

steps, therefore the lifetimes L are integers, and g(L) is
only deﬁned for integral arguments. We can calculate
the distribution of lifetimes h(L) by averaging over the
distributions generated by diﬀerent survival probabilities

at 1. However, for moderately small σ, the integration
can be carried out without too much trouble. The result-
ing density function h(L) is shown in Fig. 2 for σ = 0.15
and f = 10−4. We ﬁnd that, for L
1/f , the function
h(L) is almost linear in the log-log plot. A ﬁt to the lin-
0.01,
ear region of h(L) gives an exponent τ = 1.177
which means h(L) decays slightly steeper than the L−1
decay predicted by the approximation of Sneppen and
Newman. However, if we evaluate h(L) for much larger
L and much smaller f , we ﬁnd that the exponent τ de-
creases slowly towards the value 1 (Fig. 3).

Let us now turn to the Lorentzian distribution
pstress(x) = (2a/π)/(x2 + a2).

Here, pmax = (2/π)(1
f ) arctan(1/a). The result of the
numerical integration is shown in Fig. 4. As in the pre-
vious cases, we observe a perfect agreement between the
analytic expression for h(L) and the distribution mea-
sured in computer experiments. In the case of Lorentzian
stresses, the distribution of lifetimes is clearly not scale
invariant.

In [7] it has been claimed that the distribution of the
agents’ lifetimes under external stress decays as L−2 for
small L. Among the four stress distributions considered
in this work, we found a L−2 decay only for the uniform
stress distribution. Hence the statement made in [7] is
wrong in general. We could verify the L−1 decay reported
in [3] for exponential or Gaussian stresses. As it was also
stated there, the Lorentzian stress distribution does not
produce a scale free distribution of lifetimes.

A surprising result of this work is the observation
that the properties of the distribution of lifetimes and of
the distribution of event sizes in a coherent-noise model
are largely independent from each other. We do ﬁnd
power-law distributed lifetimes under uniform stress, un-
der which the distribution of event sizes is not scale free,
and we do not ﬁnd power-law distributed lifetimes under
Lorentzian stress, which generates a scale free distribu-
tion of event sizes. Consequently, we cannot infer from a
power-law distribution of event sizes to one of lifetimes,
and vice versa. Both distributions have to be investigated
independently for every type of stress.

Let us conclude with some remarks on the implications
of our results for the application of coherent-noise or re-
lated models to large scale evolution. In the context of
macroevolution, the agents are regarded as species, or
higher taxonomical units, such as genera or families [12].
The distribution of genus lifetimes in the fossil record
follows either a power-law decrease with exponent near
2, or an exponential decrease [13,14]. A L−2 decay can

be observed in coherent-noise models with uniform stress.
However, in this case the distribution of extinction events
does not follow the s−2 decay – with s denoting the num-
ber of families gone extinct in one time step – found in
the fossil record [2]. The distribution of lifetimes closest
to an exponential decay is, among the stress distributions
we studied here, generated by Lorentzian stresses. But
also in this case, the distribution of extinction events is
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the needed s−2 decay of ex-
tinction events. On the other hand, it seems to be typical
for distributions generating a s−2 decay, such as expo-
nential, Gaussian, or Poissonian, that the distribution of
lifetimes decays as L−1. It is arguable whether any type
of stress can actually generate the right type of distribu-
tion for lifetimes and extinction events simultaneously.
Hence, the coherent-noise models in their current for-
mulation probably miss some important ingredient as a
model of macroevolution. An eﬀect which is not covered,
and which has been shown recently to be of importance
for the statistical patterns in the fossil record, is a de-
cline in the extinction rate [14–17]. For example, Sibani
et al. [16,18] have demonstrated that the L−2 decay in
lifetimes might be closely related to the decline in the
extinction rate.

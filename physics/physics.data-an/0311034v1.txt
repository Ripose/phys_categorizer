Abstract

The deﬁnitions of the temperature in the nonextensive statistical
thermodynamics based on Tsallis entropy are analyzed. A deﬁnition
of pressure is proposed for nonadditive systems by using a nonadditive
eﬀective volume. The thermodynamics of nonadditive photon gas is
discussed on this basis. We show that the Stefan-Boltzmann law can
be preserved within nonextensive thermodynamics.

1 Introduction

The nonextensive statistical mechanics (NSM)[1] based on Tsallis entropy
is believed by many to be a candidate replacing Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics
(BGS) for nonextensive or nonadditive systems which may show probability
distributions diﬀerent from that of BGS. So according the common belief,
NSM, just as BGS, should be able to address thermodynamic functions and
intensive variables like temperature T , pressure P , chemical potential µ etc.
Although the Legendre transformation between the thermodynamic functions
is preserved in some versions of NSM with sometimes certain deformation, the
deﬁnition of intensive variables is not obvious if the thermodynamic functions

such as entropy S, energy U or free energy F are nonadditive. There are
sometimes misleading calculations using β = 1/T =

V (for photon gas) without
specifying the nonadditivity (or additivity) of each functions or noticing that
additive internal energy U and volume V associated with nonadditive S and
F will lead to non-intensive temperature or pressure which would make the
thermodynamic equilibrium or stationarity impossible in the conventional
sense.

On the other hand, within NSM, due to the fact that diﬀerent formalisms
are proposed from diﬀerent statistics or information considerations, thermo-
dynamic functions do not in general have the same nonadditive nature in
diﬀerent versions of NSM. This has led to diﬀerent deﬁnitions of, among
others, a physical or measurable temperature βp which is sometimes equal
to β[2], sometimes equal to β multiplied by a function of the partition func-
tion Z q−1[3, 4, 5, 6, 7] or Z 1−q[8, 9] which keeps βp intensive, where q is the
nonadditive entropy index1, or sometimes deﬁned by deformed entropy and
energy[9, 10, 11]. This situation often results in confusion and misleading
discussions of these temperatures[12] or other intensive variables[13], with-
out knowing or mentioning the validity conditions relevant to them and the
risk to have non intensive temperature or pressure.

The present paper tries to make a state of the art on this subject with
brief discussions of the speciﬁcities of each formalism of NSM and the relevant
consequences. It is hoped that this paper may oﬀer to the reader a global
view of the situation and of some important questions which are still matters
of intense investigation.

2 The ﬁrst deﬁnition of physical temperature

of NSM

We look at a composite system containing two subsystems A and B, all
having the same q as nonadditive entropy index. The entropy nonadditivity
of the total system is given by

S(A + B) = S(A) + S(B) + (1 − q)S(A)S(B).

This relationship is intrinsically connected with the product joint probability

pij(A + B) = pi(A)pj(B),

(2)

or inversely, where i or j is the index of physical states for A or B. Eq.(2) has
been intuitively taken as an argument for the independence of A and B and
for the energy additivity of A + B. This additivity oﬀers the ﬁrst possibility
to establish zeroth law and to deﬁne temperature within NSM[3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
The intensive physical temperature is deﬁned as

where Ei is the energy of a system at state i and a is 1 − q or q − 1 according
to the maximum entropy constraints of the formalism[8, 14], there may be
in general a conﬂict between the product joint probability and the energy
additivity condition due to the nonadditive energy Ei(A + B) = Ei(A) +
Ej(B) − aβpEi(A)Ej(B). So the validity of this thermostatistics strongly lies
on neglecting Ei(A)Ej(B).

A mathematical proof[3] shown that this was possible, for a N-body sys-
tem, if and only if q < 1 and N → ∞. This is not to be forgotten. For the
systems with q > 1 or with ﬁnite size without thermodynamic limits, this
additive energy model is not justiﬁed.

Especially, when this model is applied to the formalism of NSM de-
duced from the normalized expectation given by the escort probability U =

[14] where pi is a normalized probability which reads

3 The ﬁrst formalism of NSM

The ﬁrst formalism[1] of NSM maximizes entropy under the constraint U =

i piEi with normalized pi. The distribution function is given by

P

pi =

[1 − (q − 1)βpEi]

q−1 .

1

Z

The product probability implies the following nonadditivity of energy :

Ei(A + B) = Ei(A) + Ej(B) − (q − 1)βpEi(A)Ej(B)

(8)

and U(A + B) = U(A) + U(B) − (q − 1)βpU(A)U(B). The temperature of
this formalism is still given by Eq.(6) as brieﬂy discussed in [8].

The thermodynamic relations can be deduced from the basic expression

of entropy of this formalism

S =

Z 1−q − 1
1 − q

+ βpZ 1−qU

or Sp = Z q−1S = Z q−1−1
q−1 + βpU where Sp is an “auxiliary entropy” introduced
to write the generalized heat as dQ = TpdSp. The ﬁrst law reads dU =
TpdSp − dW . The free energy F is deﬁned as

F = U − TpSp = −Tp

Z q−1 − 1
q − 1

.

The ﬁrst law becomes dF = −SpdTp − dW where dW is the work done by
the system.

Sp can be calculated by using Sp = −

and Eqs.(5) and (10) with

This formalism is deduced from the entropy maximum under the constraint
U =

and the nonadditivity of energy by Ei(A + B) = Ei(A) + Ej(B) − (1 −

U(A + B) = U(A)Z 1−q(B) + U(B)Z 1−q(A) + (q − 1)βpU(A)U(B).

(13)

As discussed in [2], this is the only formalism of NSM in which the math-
ematical framework of the thermodynamic relationships is strictly identical
to that of BGS with βp = β. The heat is given by dQ = T dS, the ﬁrst law
by dU = T dS − dW and the free energy by

F = U − T S = −T

incomplete statistics.

The above calculation of Sp cannot be carried out for S by using β or
T because S 6= − ∂F
∂T although we can write F = U − TpSp = U − T S. In
addition, Z is not derivable with respect to β since it is a self-referential
function when written as a function of β. This calculation can be done for S
only in the second formalism with unnormalized expectation and normalized
probability associated to β = 1/T = ∂S
∂U .
An additive form of this formalism of a nonadditive statistical ther-
modynamics is proposed by using some deformed entropy s and energy
and ei = ln[1+(q−1)βpEi]
ei[9], where s =

s(A + B) = s(A) + s(B) and eij(A + B) = ei(A) + ej(B). The maximization

In this deformed formalism, everything is just as in BGS. This mathematical
framework has been used for the equilibrium problem of the systems having
diﬀerent q’s[10, 11].

6 Systems having diﬀerent q’s

The reader should have noticed that all the above discussions are based on
the entropy nonadditivity given by Eq.(1) which is valid only for systems
having the same index q. For systems A, B and A + B each having its own
q, this relationship breaks down even if the product joint probability holds.
So for establishing the zeroth law, we need more general nonadditivity for
entropy. A possible one is proposed as follows[10] :

(1 − qA+B)S(A + B) = (1 − qA)S(A) + (1 − qB)S(B)

(21)

+ (1 − qA)(1 − qB)S(A)S(B)

which recovers Eq.(1) whenever qA+B = qA = qB.

P

i pq

i ei with

i pi = 1[10], or u =

The establishment of zeroth law for this case has been discussed by using
the unnormalized expectations just as in the second formalism of NSM, i.e.,
u =
i = 1[11]. The reason
for this is that these unnormalized expectations allow one to split the ther-
P
modynamics of the composite systems into those of the subsystems through
the generalized product joint probability pqA+B
(A + B) = pqA
i (B) if
i pq
i = 1]. This thermodynamic
splitting is just a necessary condition for the statistical interpretation of the
P
zeroth law.

7 What about the pressure?

If the work in the ﬁrst law is dW = P dV , where P is the pressure and V a
certain volume, then the pressure can be calculated through P = −
. If
we want the pressure to be intensive, V will be nonadditive. This is a delicate
choice to make since nonadditive volume is nontrivial and not so easy to be
understood as nonadditive energy or entropy. For a standard system, we tend
to suppose additive volume as well as additive particle number. However, in
view of the fact that the work dW is in general nonadditive, additive volume
implies non intensive pressure P , which is impossible if the equilibrium or
stationary state is established in the conventional sense for, e.g. a gas of

photons or of other particles. So, ﬁrst of all, for the following discussion,
let us suppose an intensive pressure P , i.e., P (A) = P (B) at equilibrium or
stationarity.

Intensive P implies nonadditive V .

If one wants to suppose additive
volume (the real one) and particle number N, V must be regarded as an
eﬀective volume, as a function of the real volume Vp supposed additive.

In this case, a question arises about the nature of the work dW which
is no more proportional to the real volume dVp.
Is it a real work? Our
answer is Yes because dW is supposed to contribute to the energy variation
dU or dF according to the ﬁrst law. A possibility to account for this work
is that, for a nonextensive or nonadditive system, e.g., a small system or
a heterogeneous system, the surface/interface eﬀects on the total energy,
compared with the volume eﬀect, are not negligible. When the pressure
makes a small volume variation dVp, the work may be dW = P dVp + dWσ
where dWσ is the part of work related to the surface/interface variation dσ.
In general, the relationship dWσ ∼ dσ should depend on the nature and
the geometry of the system of interest. If we suppose a simple case where
dWσ = αP d(σθ) and σ = γV η
p (α, γ, η and θ are certain constants), the work
p ) = P d[Vp + αγV ηθ
can be written as dW = P dVp + αγP d(V ηθ
p ] which means
V = Vp + αγV ηθ
p . This example shows that a nonadditive eﬀective volume
can be used for nonextensive systems to write the nonadditive work in the
form dW = P dV , just as in the conventional additive thermodynamics.

7.1 A deﬁnition of pressure for NSM

Now let us come back to NSM. To determine the nonadditivity of the eﬀective
volume V with additive real volume Vp, one has to choose a given version
of NSM with given nonadditivity of entropy and energy. Without lose of
generality, the following discussion will be made within the second formalism
of NSM. From the entropy deﬁnition and nonadditivity Eq.(1) and the energy
nonadditivity Eq.(13), we can write, at equilibrium or stationarity,

dS(A + B) = [1 + (1 − q)S(B)]dS(A) + [1 + (1 − q)S(A)]dS(B)

It can be checked that this kind of calculation is also possible within

7.2 About nonadditive photon gas

Now let us suppose a nonadditive photon gas, which is possible when emission
body is small. For example, the emission of nanoparticles or of small optical
cavity whose surface/interface eﬀect may be important. We have seen in
the above paragraph that dU, dS and dV should be proportional to each
other. This can be satisﬁed by U = f (T )V and S = g(T )V . In addition,
we admit the photon pressure given by P = U
3 f (T ). From the ﬁrst law
dU = T dS − P dV , we obtain

in the conventional thermodynamics. This is because the thermodynamic
functions here, though nonadditive, are nevertheless “extensive” with respect
to the eﬀective volume. This result contradicts what has been claimed for
blackbody radiation on the basis of non intensive pressure[13], and is valid
as far as the pressure is intensive.

Is intensive pressure always true? The ﬁnal answer of course depends on
experimental proofs which are still missing as far as we know. If pressure may
be non intensive for nonadditive or nonextensive systems, the whole theory
of thermodynamics must be reviewed.

8 Conclusion

In summery, we have analyzed all the temperature deﬁnitions of NSM we can
actually ﬁnd in the literature. A deﬁnition of intensive pressure is proposed
for nonextensive thermodynamics by using a nonadditive eﬀective volume.
The thermodynamics of a nonadditive photon gas is discussed on that ba-
sis. It is shown from purely thermodynamic point of view that the Stefan-
Boltzmann law can be valid within NSM in this case.

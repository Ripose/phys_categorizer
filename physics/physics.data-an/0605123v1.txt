Abstract

Two modiﬁcations of the χ2 test for comparing usual (unweighted) and weighted his-
tograms and two weighted histograms are proposed. Numerical examples illustrate
an application of the tests for the histograms with diﬀerent statistics of events. Pro-
posed tests can be used for the comparison of experimental data histograms against
simulated data histograms and two simulated data histograms.

1 Introduction

A frequently used technique in data analysis is the comparison of histograms.
First suggested by Pearson [1] the χ2 test of homogeneity is used widely for
comparing usual (unweighted) histograms. The modiﬁed χ2 test for compari-
son of weighted and unweighted histograms recently was proposed in [2].

This paper develops the ideas presented in [2]. From this development, two new
results are presented. First, the χ2 test for comparing weighted and unweighted
histograms is improved so that it can be applied for histograms with lower
minimal number of events in a bin than is recommended in [2]. And secondly,
a new χ2 test is proposed for the comparison two weighted histograms.

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 the usual χ2 test and its appli-
cation for the comparison of usual unweighted histograms is discussed. Tests
for the comparison of weighted and unweighted histograms and two weighted

are illustrated and veriﬁed by a numerical example and experiments.

χ2 test for comparison two (unweighted) histograms

Without limiting the general nature of the discussion, we consider two his-
tograms with the same binning and the number of bins equal to r. Let us
denote the number of events in the ith bin in the ﬁrst histogram as ni and
as mi in the second one. The total number of events in the ﬁrst histogram is
equal to N =

r
i=1 mi in the second histogram.

r
i=1 ni, and M =

P

P

The hypothesis of homogeneity [3] is that the two histograms represent random
values with identical distributions. It is equivalent that there exist r constants
r
p1, ..., pr, such that
i=1 pi = 1, and the probability of belonging to the ith
bin for some measured value in both experiments is equal to pi. The number
of events in the ith bin is a random variable with a distribution approximated
by a Poisson probability distribution e−N pi(Npi)ni/ni! for the ﬁrst histogram
and with distribution e−M pi(Mpi)mi/mi! for the second histogram. If the hy-
pothesis of homogeneity is valid, then the maximum likelihood estimator of
pi, i = 1, ..., r, is

has approximately a χ2

The comparison procedure can include an analysis of the residuals which is
often helpful in identifying the bins of histograms responsible for a signiﬁcant
overall X 2 value. Most convenient for analysis are the adjusted (normalized)
residuals [4]

If hypotheses of homogeneity are valid then residuals ri are approximately
(0, 1) dis-
independent and identically distributed random variables having
tribution. Notice that residuals (3) are related with the ﬁrst histogram and
residuals related with the second histogram are:

The application of the χ2 test has restrictions related to the value of the
expected frequencies Npi, Mpi, i = 1, ..., r. A conservative rule formulated in
[5] is that all the expectations must be 1 or greater for both histograms. The
authors point out that this rule is extremely conservative and in the majority
of cases the χ2 test may be used for histograms with expectations in excess of
0.5 in the smallest bin. In practical cases when expected frequencies are not
known the estimated expected frequencies M ˆpi, N ˆpi, i = 1, ..., r can be used.

3 Unweighted and weighted histograms comparison

A simple modiﬁcation of the ideas described above can be used for the com-
parison of the usual (unweighted) and weighted histograms. Let us denote the
number of events in the ith bin in the unweighted histogram as ni and the com-
mon weight of events in the ith bin of the weighted histogram as wi. The total
r
i=1 ni and
number of events in the unweighted histogram is equal to N =
r
i=1 wi.
the total weight of events in the weighted histogram is equal to W =
P

P

Let us formulate the hypothesis of identity of an unweighted histogram to
a weighted histogram so that there exist r constants p1, ..., pr, such that
r
i=1 pi = 1, and the probability of belonging to the ith bin for some mea-
sured value is equal to pi for the unweighted histogram and expectation value
P
of weight wi equal to W pi for the weighted histogram. The number of events in
the ith bin is a random variable with distribution approximated by the Pois-
son probability distribution e−N pi(Npi)ni/ni! for the unweighted histogram.
The weight wi is a random variable with a distribution approximated by the
(W pi, σ2
is the variance of the
normal probability distribution
weight wi. If we replace the variance σ2
i (sum of squares of
weights of events in the ith bin) and the hypothesis of identity is valid, then
the maximum likelihood estimator of pi, i = 1, ..., r, is

This test, as well as the original one [3], has a restriction on the expected fre-
quencies. The expected frequencies recommended for the weighted histogram

is more than 25. The value of the minimal expected frequency can be de-
creased down to 10 for the case when the weights of the events are close to
constant. In the case of a weighted histogram if the number of events is un-
known, then we can apply this recommendation for the equivalent number of
events as nequiv
i . The minimal expected frequency for an unweighted
histogram must be 1. Notice that any usual (unweighted) histogram can be
considered as a weighted histogram with events that have constant weights
equal to 1.

deﬁned on the interval [4, 16]. Events distributed according to the formula
(12) are simulated to create the unweighted histogram. Uniformly distributed
events are simulated for the weighted histogram with weights calculated by
formula (12). Each histogram has the same number of bins: 20. Fig. 1 shows
the result of comparison of the unweighted histogram with 200 events (minimal
expected frequency equal to one) and the weighted histogram with 500 events
(minimal expected frequency equal to 25)

The value of the test statistic X 2 is equal to 21.09 with p-value equal to 0.33,
therefore the hypothesis of identity of the two histograms can be accepted.
The behavior of the normalized residuals plot (see Fig. 1c) and the normal
Q-Q plot (see Fig. 1d) of residuals are regular and we cannot identify the
outliers or bins with a big inﬂuence on X 2.

To investigate the dependence of the distribution of the test statistics from
the number of events all three tests were considered.

The comparison of pairs of unweighted histograms with diﬀerent minimal ex-
pected frequencies was considered (Pearson’s chi square test). Unweighted his-
tograms with minimal expected frequencies equal to one (200 events), 2.5 (500
events) and 5 (1000 events) where simulated. Fig. 2 shows the Q-Q plots of
X 2 statistics for diﬀerent pairs of histograms. In each case 10000 pairs of his-
tograms were simulated. As we can see for all cases the real distributions of

The comparison of pairs of unweighted and weighted histograms with diﬀerent
minimal expected frequencies was considered using the test proposed in sec-
tion 3 above. Unweighted histograms with minimal expected frequencies equal
to one (200 events), 2.5 (500 events) and 5 (1000 events) where simulated.
Furthermore weighted histograms with minimal expected frequencies equal to
10 (200 events), 25 (500 events) and 50 (1000 events) where simulated. Fig.

pected frequency of weighted events, equal to 10, has a heavier tail than the
theoretical χ2
19 distribution. This means that the p-value calculated with the
theoretical χ2
19 distribution is lower than the real p-value and any decision
about the rejection of the hypothesis of identity of the two distributions is
conservative. The distributions of test statistics for the minimal expected fre-
quencies 25 and 50 are close to the theoretical distribution. This conﬁrms that
the minimal expected frequency 25 is reasonable restriction for the weighted
histogram for this test.

The comparison of two weighted histograms with diﬀerent minimal expected
frequencies was considered using the test proposed in section 4 above. Weighted
histograms with minimal expected frequencies equal to 10 (200 events), 25 (500
events) and 50 (1000 events) where simulated. Fig. 4 shows the Q-Q plots of X 2
statistics for diﬀerent pairs of histograms. As we can see the real distributions
of the test statistics are close to the theoretical χ2

expectations of the two histograms are close to each other, it is in all cases
excluding case (10, 50). For the case when the diﬀerence in expectations are
big (10, 50) the real distribution of the test statistics has a heavier tail than
the theoretical χ2

19.

To verify the proposed tests two further numerical experiments were per-
formed.

For the ﬁrst case unweighted histograms with minimal expected frequencies
equal to 10 (2000 events), 25 (5000 events) and 50 (10000 events) were simu-
lated. These histograms were compared to an unweighted histogram with 10
or more expected frequencies by the three methods described above. Fig. 5
shows the Q-Q plots of X 2 statistics for diﬀerent pairs of histograms. As we
can see the real distributions of the test statistics are close to the theoretical
χ2

19 distribution for all three tests.

For the second case unweighted histograms with minimal expected frequencies
equal to one (200 events), 2.5 (500 events) and 5 (1000 events) were simulated.
These histograms were compared to an unweighted histogram with 10 or more
expected frequencies by the ﬁrst two methods described above. Fig. 6 shows
the Q-Q plots of the X 2 statistics for diﬀerent pairs of histograms. As we can
see for all cases the real distributions of the test statistics are close to the theo-
retical χ2
19 distribution. Also the real distributions of the test statistics for the
proposed method of comparison of unweighted and weighted histograms (see
Fig. 6b) do not have heavy tails as is the case for a weighted histogram with
weights calculated according formula (12) (see Fig. 3). This example conﬁrms
that the minimal expected frequency equal to 10 is enough for the application
of the method of comparison of unweighted and weighted histograms if the
weights of the events are close to a constant for the weighted histogram.

6 Conclusions

A chi square test for comparing the usual (unweighted) histogram and the
weighted histogram, together with a test for comparing two weighted his-
tograms were proposed. In both cases formulas for normalized residuals were
presented that can be useful for the identiﬁcations of bins that are outliers, or
bins that have a big inﬂuence on X 2. For the ﬁrst test the recommended min-
imal expected frequency of events is equal to 1 for an unweighted histogram
and 10-25 for a weighted histogram. For the second test the recommended
minimal expected frequency is equal to 10. Numerical examples illustrated an
application of the method for the histograms with diﬀerent statistics of events
and conﬁrm that the proposed restrictions related with the expectations are

comparison of several unweighted and weighted histograms or just weighted
histograms. The test statistic has approximately a χ2
(r−1)(s−1) distribution for
s histograms with r bins.

A method based on wavelet transform and genetic programming is proposed for characterizing and
modeling variations at multiple scales in non-stationary time series. The cyclic variations, extracted
by wavelets and smoothened by cubic splines, are well captured by genetic programming in the form
of dynamical equations. For the purpose of illustration, we analyze two diﬀerent non-stationary
ﬁnancial time series, S&P CNX Nifty closing index of the National Stock Exchange (India) and
Dow Jones industrial average closing values through Haar, Daubechies-4 and continuous Morlet
wavelets for studying the character of ﬂuctuations at diﬀerent scales, before modeling the cyclic
behavior through GP. Cyclic variations emerge at intermediate time scales and the corresponding
dynamical equations reveal characteristic behavior at diﬀerent scales.

INTRODUCTION

A number of non-stationary time series are known to
comprise of ﬂuctuations having both stochastic and cyclic
or periodic components. Isolating ﬂuctuations from these
time series, at diﬀerent scales for the purpose of char-
acterization and modeling is a research area of signiﬁ-
cant interest [1, 2, 3]. Here we explicate a wavelet based
approach for separating structured variations from the
stochastic ones in a time series before modeling them
through genetic programming (GP). For the purpose of
illustration we have chosen two ﬁnancial time series, since
the same is well-known to exhibit random and structured
behavior at diﬀerent scales [4, 5]. At small time scales,
the ﬂuctuations are primarily stochastic in nature; at
higher scales the random part is averaged out and char-
acteristic nature of the variations become transparent.
For a reliable analysis one also needs to have a reason-
ably long data set for which the ﬁnancial time series are
well suited. The chosen time series are S&P CNX Nifty
closing index of the National Stock Exchange (India) and
Dow Jones industrial average closing values, representing
two suﬃciently diﬀerent economic climates so as to bring
out the eﬃcacy of the present approach.

Study and characterization of ﬂuctuations in ﬁnancial
time series have been studied through a variety of ap-
proaches. For example, variations have been analyzed
through Levy-stable non-Gaussian model [6]. Stochastic
nature of the high frequency ﬂuctuations and presence
of structured behavior have emerged through study of

these time series using random matrix theory. In partic-
ular, analysis of the cross-correlations between diﬀerent
stocks [7, 8] reveal universal and non-universal phenom-
ena. The latter ones indicate correlated behavior between
stocks of diﬀerent companies. This behavior can manifest
in the composite stock price indices, where the correlated
behavior of several companies can give rise to structured
or cyclic behavior in appropriate time scales. Wavelet
transform, because of its multi-resolution analysis prop-
erty is well-suited to isolate ﬂuctuations and variations
at diﬀerent scales [9, 10].

The goal of the present article is to demonstrate the
usefulness of combining wavelet transform with tools like
genetic programming for modeling of ﬂuctuations. We
carry out our analysis on two diﬀerent ﬁnancial time
series, in order to ﬁnd out the similarities and diﬀer-
ences between them, from the perspective of ﬂuctuations.
Apart from sharp transients representing sudden varia-
tions ascribable to physical causes, the high frequency
ﬂuctuations at small scales are primarily random in char-
In all the time series, cyclic behavior emerges

at higher scales, when the random ﬂuctuations are av-
eraged out. The physical nature of the cyclic phenomena
is substantiated through both discrete and continuous
wavelets. In case of continuous wavelets, the scalogram
clearly reveals cyclic behavior at intermediate scales. We
then proceed to model these variations through Genetic
Programming (GP) [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. For that pur-
pose, we smoothen the cyclic behavior at every scale,
corresponding to diﬀerent levels of wavelet decomposi-
tion, through a cubic spline. It needs to be mentioned
that, since the purpose is to model cyclic behavior, physi-
cally it is meaningful to smoothen the same, before trying
to model them.

We study the ﬂuctuation characteristics of two diﬀer-
ent ﬁnancial time series, S&P CNX Nifty closing index
of the National Stock Exchange (India) and Dow Jones

forms belonging to both discrete and continuous families.
Haar and Daubechies-4 (Db4) from the discrete wavelet
family and the continuous Morlet wavelet are used to an-
alyze the time series. As has been observed earlier, at
small scales, the ﬂuctuations captured by the wavelet co-
eﬃcients exhibit self-similar character [16]. Clear cyclic
behavior emerges in medium scales and is evident from
both discrete and continuous wavelet analysis. It is found
that, GP captures the cyclic behavior at each scale quite

The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we
give a brief introduction to wavelets before carrying out
wavelet decomposition of both the data sets considered
to study the character of the variations at diﬀerent scales.
Cyclic variations at diﬀerent scales is extracted through
Daubechies-4 wavelet and conﬁrmed by continuous Mor-
let wavelet. We then proceed to model the cyclic phe-
nomenon through GP in section III and conclude in sec-
tion IV, after pointing out a number of applications and
future directions of work through the present method.

II. WAVELET TRANSFORM

Wavelet transform provides a powerful tool for the
analysis of transient and non-stationary data and is par-
ticularly useful in picking out characteristic variations
at diﬀerent resolutions or scales [17]. In the context of
ﬁnancial time series [18, 19], it has found extensive ap-
plications. It has been used for the study of commodity
prices [20], in measuring correlations [21], in the study

of foreign exchange rates [22] and for predicting stock
market behavior [23, 24], to name a few. This linear
transform separates a data set in the form of low-pass
or average coeﬃcients, resembling the data itself, and
wavelet or high-pass coeﬃcients at diﬀerent levels, which
capture the variations at corresponding scales. Wavelets
can be continuous or discrete.
In the latter case, the
basis elements are strictly ﬁnite in size, enabling them
to achieve localization, while disentangling characteristic
variations at diﬀerent frequencies.

In discrete wavelet transform (DWT), the construc-
tion of basis set starts with the scaling function ϕ(x)
(father wavelet) and the mother wavelet ψ(x), whose
height and width are arbitrary: R ϕdx = A, R ψdx =
0, R ϕψdx = 0, R |ϕ|2dx = 1, R |ψ|2dx = 1, where A is
an arbitrary constant. The scaling and wavelet functions,
and their scaled translates, known as daughter wavelets,
ψj,k = 2j/2ψ(2jx − k), are square integrable at diﬀerent
scales. Here, k and j respectively are the translation and
scaling parameters, with −∞ ≤ k ≤ +∞. Although con-
ventionally, one starts with the scale value j = 0, one
can begin from any ﬁnite value j′ and increase it by in-

tegral units. The original mother wavelet corresponds to
ψ0,0. The daughter wavelets are of a similar form as the
mother wavelet, except that their width and height dif-
fer by a factor of 2j and 2j/2 respectively, at successive
levels. The translation unit k/2j is commensurate with
the thinner size of the daughter wavelet at scale j. In
the limit j → ∞, these basis functions form a complete
orthonormal set, allowing us to expand a signal f (t) in
the form,

f (t) =

cj,kϕj,k(t) +

dj′,kψj′,k(t)

Here, cj,k’s are the low-pass coeﬃcients and dj,k’s are
the high-pass or wavelet coeﬃcients. They respectively
capture the average part and variations of the signal
at scale j and location k. For the discrete wavelets,
the property of multi-resolution analysis (MRA) leads
˜h(n − 2k)cj+1,n,
to cj,k = Pn h(n − 2k)cj+1,n, dj,k = Pn
where h(n) and ˜h(n) are respectively the low-pass (scal-
ing function) and high-pass (wavelet) ﬁlter coeﬃcients,
which diﬀer for diﬀerent wavelets. Both low-pass and
high-pass coeﬃcients at a scale j can be obtained from
the low-pass coeﬃcients at a higher scale (cj+1,n). This
implies that, starting from the ﬁnest resolution of the
signal, one can construct both scaling and wavelet coef-
ﬁcients, by convolution with the ﬁlter coeﬃcients h(n)
and ˜h(n).

and ˜h(0) =

wavelet, which is symmetric and compactly supported.
In a level one Haar wavelet decomposition, the level-I
low-pass (average) and high-pass (wavelet or detail) co-
eﬃcients are respectively given by the nearest neighbor
averages and diﬀerences, with the normalization factor
. In the subsequent step, the average coeﬃcients
of
are divided into two parts, containing level-II high-pass
and level-II low-pass coeﬃcients. The high-pass coeﬃ-
cients now represent diﬀerences of averaged data points
corresponding to a window size of two. Wavelets be-
longing to Daubechies family are designed such that,
the wavelet coeﬃcients are independent of polynomial
trends in the data. For example, Daubechies-4 wavelet
satisﬁes, R tψ(t)dt = 0, in addition to all other condi-
tions. Because of this the wavelet coeﬃcients here cap-
ture ﬂuctuations over and above the linear variations.

In DWT, a maximum of N level decompositions can
be carried out, when the data set is of size 2N . One may
choose to have a less number of decompositions than N .
Often one needs to supplement the data with additional
points to carry out a N level decomposition. Both in
DWT and CWT, one encounters boundary artifacts, due
to circular or other forms of extensions. In our case, for
minimizing these boundary artifacts, we have used sym-
metric extension, while studying the behavior of wavelet
coeﬃcients. The variations at diﬀerent scales are charac-
terized by their respective powers, deﬁned as the squared
sum of the wavelet coeﬃcients at that level. Since in
wavelet transform power is conserved, the squared sum
of all the low pass and high pass coeﬃcients add up to the
squared sum of the data points of the time series, called
as the total power or energy. We have used normalized
power which is the power at a given level divided by the
total power. Periodic extension has been used for ana-
lyzing the distribution of power at various levels, since
this extension conserves power. The power plots depict-
ing high pass power and low pass power clearly reveal the
character of the ﬂuctuation and the average behavior.

We start with the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of
India Nifty daily closing index values, consisting of 2048
data points, covering the duration from 24th December
1997 to 16th February 2006. This daily index is shown
in Fig. 1. We carry out an eight level decomposition
through Haar transform, since the same yields a trans-
parent picture about the nature of the variations. The
high pass coeﬃcients are depicted in Fig. 2. Transient
and cyclic behavior at diﬀerent scales are clearly visible.
The corresponding low pass coeﬃcients corresponding to
8th level are depicted in Fig. 3. As expected, these low
pass coeﬃcients capture the average behavior of the time
series (see Fig. 1). At ﬁner resolutions corresponding to
lower level wavelet coeﬃcients, one can clearly see pri-
marily random nature of the ﬂuctuations.

The non-random variations signiﬁcantly increase from
6th level onwards. Substantial increase in power at 6th
level is also evident in Fig. 4, which shows the behavior
of the normalized power of the high pass coeﬃcients. The
normalized power of low pass coeﬃcients shown in Fig.
5 start decreasing from 6th level onwards, since the total
power is conserved in wavelet transform. It is worth men-
tioning that the 6th level high pass coeﬃcients correspond
to the diﬀerences of data points, averaged over a tempo-
ral window size 32. A few transient phenomena are also
revealed by these coeﬃcients. After suﬃcient averaging,
cyclic behavior is seen to emerge. The averaged low pass
coeﬃcients reveal a linear trend like the time series in Fig.
1; this can aﬀect the high pass coeﬃcients. In order to
remove this and capture the characteristic nature of the
variations, we have carried out decomposition through
Daubechies-4 wavelets. The structured and cyclic behav-
ior is transparently demonstrated in Fig. 6. This justiﬁes
the use of Daubechies-4 wavelets, which removes linear
trend from the high-pass coeﬃcients. Plots of both high-
pass and low-pass normalized power reveal that at higher

scales ﬂuctuations capture most of the energy; the high-
pass power increases, while that of low-pass decreases
progressively. CWT through Morlet wavelets also reveal
the cyclic behavior at intermediate scales as seen in Fig.
7. The scale values indicate the window size of the Mor-
let wavelet corresponding to the same number of days.
We depict in Fig. 8 sum over the continuous wavelet
coeﬃcients over scales as a function of time. An approx-
imate periodic behavior is seen with a period of about
200 trading days. The fact that wavelet coeﬃcients con-
taining both positive and negative values add up to yield
a periodic behavior indicates the presence of correlated
behavior. As is clear, purely random un-correlated coef-
ﬁcients will not lead to this structure.

We next consider the Dow Jones industrial average
(DJIA) closing values, shown in Fig.
9 having 2048
data points for the duration lying within 22nd February
1993 to 25th January 2001. An eight level decomposi-
tion through Haar transform is then carried out to infer
about the nature of the variations. The high pass co-
eﬃcients are depicted in Fig. 10. Transient and cyclic
behavior at diﬀerent scales are clearly visible like the pre-
vious case of Nifty data. It is to be noted that the 2nd
half of the forward wavelet coeﬃcients for each level is
having higher amplitudes as compared to the ﬁrst half
of the coeﬃcients. In this respect, variations of wavelet
coeﬃcients of Nifty data and DJIA data have diﬀerent
characteristics. The corresponding low pass coeﬃcients
are shown in Fig. 11. As is evident, these low pass coeﬃ-
cients show the trend of the time series. The normalized
power of the high pass coeﬃcients (Fig. 12) shows a con-
tinuous rise with levels having a small decline at level 8.
Correspondingly the low pass coeﬃcients show continu-
ous decrease in the power (Fig. 13). In Fig. 14 we show
the Db4 wavelet coeﬃcients for levels 1 to 8 for the pur-
pose of comparison with the corresponding Nifty index
behavior.

We have studied the behavior of DJIA under CWT.
The corresponding scalogram is shown in Fig. 15. Akin
to the Nifty case one sees cyclic behavior in the scale

all scales plotted as a function of time (Fig. 16) reveal a
periodic behavior of little less than 200 trading days. In
this context both the ﬁnancial time series show similar
behavior. However the DJIA time series is showing a
tendency of bursty behavior which is absent in Nifty case.
Considering the cyclic behavior of variations at inter-
mediate scales, it is interesting to see how well these
wavelet coeﬃcients can be analyzed through the tech-
niques of Genetic Programming in which the model equa-
tions are built in the reconstructed phase space. This
modeling can reveal characteristic behavior of ﬂuctua-

Here f represents a function involving time series values
Xt in the immediate past and arithmetic operators (+,
-, × and ÷). The numbers appearing in function f are
bounded between the range [-N, N], where N is an inte-
ger number, we have chosen N to be 10. The numbers
within the above range are generated with the precision
of 1 digit after decimal point. In the above equation, d
represents the number of previous time series values that
may appear in the function and τ represents a time delay.

During the GP optimization, one considers a pool of
chromosomes. A chromosome represents a potential solu-
tion. Evolution to successive generations is then carried
out stochastically by applying genetic operators, namely
copy, crossover and mutation.

For a given chromosome, the lower the above sum of
squared errors, the better is the ﬁt generated and there-
fore the corresponding chromosome fairs better chance of
participating in further evolutionary process through its
ﬁtness measure. The ﬁtness measure is derived from △2

It is observed that during the optimization process, in
order to get higher and higher ﬁtness measures, GP may
lead to quite involved chromosome strings. In order to
discourage GP to over ﬁt by generating longer strings
of chromosomes, the ﬁtness measure is modiﬁed [15] as
follows,

th

values. We have therefore found it necessary to smoothen
these wavelet coeﬃcients using an appropriate method.
For all the wavelet coeﬃcients of diﬀerent levels consid-
ered, we smoothen them using a cubic Spline interpo-
lation method. We generate smoothened coeﬃcients by
incorporating 4 additional points which are sampled by
cubic Spline method for each consecutive pair of points.
The piecewise polynomial form of the smoothened data
is well suited with a similar structure used for the map
equation (Eq. 3) searched by Genetic Programming. It
is worth emphasizing that this procedure is appropriate
since we are modeling cyclic behavior which are gener-
ally smooth in nature as compared to sharp variations of
transients.

We now proceed with modeling of smoothened Db4
forward wavelet coeﬃcients using GP at level=6, 7 and
8.

modiﬁed ﬁtness measure prefers a parsimonious model by
generating crisp map equations for chromosomes. For R2
close to 0, the modiﬁed ﬁtness measure r can be negative.
The map equations generated by above GP prescrip-
tion is then used to make out-of-sample predictions out-
side the ﬁtted set of data and the measure of goodness
of predictions is ascertained by normalized mean square

On trying to model these wavelet coeﬃcients,

it is
found that due to sharp variations, the GP optimiza-
tion does not lead to convergence having good ﬁtness

As seen earlier cyclic and structured variations emerge
at relatively higher scales. For modeling purpose, we
consider the 6, 7 and 8th level coeﬃcients generated using
Db4 forward wavelet transform. These coeﬃcients show
considerable cyclic ﬂuctuations both at local and global
scales. At 6th level, bursty behavior is also seen.

We have divided the values of these wavelet ﬂuctua-
tions by 1000 for the sake of computational convenience.
The smoothened wavelet coeﬃcients for level=6, 7 and
8 are shown in Figs. 17, 18 and 19 along with original
wavelet coeﬃcients.

The smoothened wavelet coeﬃcients are then mod-
elled using GP. We have used d=5 and τ =1 for these
ﬁts and the resulting ﬁts are very good having ﬁtness
values 0.99499 (level=6), 0.99498 (level=7) and 0.997038
(level=8).

The map equations are shown in Eq. 8, 9 and 10.

FIG. 23: Contributions of individual terms in the right hand
side of Eq. 8 for Db4 level-6 wavelet coeﬃcients for Nifty
data.
It is observed that the ﬁrst and third terms are the
dominant ones which give rise to the bursty behavior (Fig.
20) due to their slight out of phase dynamics.

els, we observe that the 6th level variations show cyclic
as well as bursty behavior. Interestingly, the 7th level co-
eﬃcients show smooth variations; the corresponding GP
equation (Eq. 9) is completely linear. On the contrary
the 8th level variations show non-smooth variations which
are not bursty like the 6th level coeﬃcients.

In order to understand the interplay of diﬀerent terms
giving rise to the bursty behavior, we have computed the
contributions arising from each term of Eq. 8 individu-
ally. The same is shown in Fig. 23. It is clearly seen
that the ﬁrst and the third term are the dominant ones,
which are slightly out of phase from each other. The
corresponding cancellation is responsible for the bursty
behavior. The dynamical origin of these terms and their
modeling is rather non-trivial, which needs signiﬁcant in-
vestigations.

The map equations will now be used to carry out 1-step
out-of-sample predictions beyond the ﬁtted points. The
predictions for level=6, 7 and 8 are shown in Figs. 24,
25 and 26 respectively with corresponding NMSE values
as 0.04923, 0.03907 and 0.03946 respectively. It can be
seen that the 1-step predictions are very good.

B. Modeling variations in Dow Jones Industrial
Average Closing values

We next consider modeling of Db4 wavelet coeﬃcients
for Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closing values.
Akin to the GP analysis for Nifty wavelet coeﬃcients, we
have found it useful to smoothen the wavelet coeﬃcients
using Cubic Spline for the purpose of GP modeling. This
also makes it easier to compare the cyclic variations in
the two time series considered

The comparison of Db4 forward wavelet coeﬃcients for
level=6, 7 and 8 with the Cubic Spline smoothened coef-
ﬁcients are shown in Figs. 27, 28 and 29.

As seen in Figs. 30, 31 and 32 for level=6, 7 and 8

respectively, the GP ﬁts are quite good.

Similar to the Nifty analysis, the GP equations are
primarily of linear type having non-linear terms of Pad´e
type. Eq. 11 is primarily linear. The eﬀect of nonlinear-
ity as seen from the Pad´e terms is diﬀerent from the Nifty
behavior. Eq. 12 shows a very interesting behavior. If
diﬀerence between two consecutive data points are small,
then the Pad´e term gives a strong contribution, which de-
creases as the diﬀerences increase. Eq. 13 representing
level 8 coeﬃcients is again mostly linear.

We then use these map equations and carry out 1-step
out-of-sample predictions beyond the ﬁtted points. These
predictions are found to be very good as is reﬂected from
their small NMSE values, 0.001787 (level=6), 0.002379
(level=7) and 0.0004981 (level=8). The predictions are
shown for level=6, 7 and 8 in Figs. 33, 34 and 35 respec-
tively and are found to be excellent.

IV. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have illustrated a wavelet based ap-
proach to separate stochastic and structured variations
in non-stationary time series. Modeling diﬀerent aspects
e.g., ﬂuctuations and trend of these time series is a chal-
lenging task. It becomes particularly diﬃcult when the
ﬂuctuations comprise of random, cyclic and transient
variations at multiple scales. The fact that wavelet trans-
form possesses multi-resolution analysis capability, has
opened the way to isolate variations at diﬀerent scales.

programming models the cyclic behavior well through
crisp dynamical equations. One step predictions have
been carried through and these are found to be quite
accurate.

Apart from studying other physical time series, it will
be nice to combine the present approach with random
matrix based ones for the purpose of pinpointing emer-
gence of cyclic behavior. As has been mentioned earlier,
random matrix approach has indicated correlation be-
tween group of companies in ﬁnancial time series, which
can lead to cyclic or structured variations apparent in the
present analysis. Hence, it will be of deep interest to see
if these two can be interrelated.

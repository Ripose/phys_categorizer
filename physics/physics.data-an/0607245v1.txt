This paper studies the dynamics of Brazilian interest rates for short-term maturities. The paper
employs developed techniques in the econophysics literature and tests for long-range dependence
in the term structure of these interest rates for the last decade. Empirical results suggest that the
degree of long-range dependence has changed over time due to changes in monetary policy, specially
in the short-end of the term structure of interest rates. Therefore, we show that it is possible to
identify monetary arrangements using these techniques from econophysics.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The analysis of persistence in interest rates is a fun-
damental question in macroeconomics and ﬁnance.
In
macroeconomics, since monetary policy is implemented
through the setting of short-term interest, the term struc-
ture of interest rates carries information regarding expec-
tations of future movements in short-term interest rates.
However, very little research has been conducted to study
changes in the dynamics of persistence in interest rates.
This paper presents a contribution to the literature
by studying whether changes in monetary policy stance,
namely the implementation of an inﬂation targeting
regime and adoption of a ﬂoating exchange rate regime,
produce a change in the persistence of interest rates. We
measure persistence in this paper employing two devel-
oped techniques in econophysics, which are the detrended
ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) [Moreira et al, 2004; Peng
et al, 2004] and Generalized Hurst exponents (GHE)
[Barab´asi and Vicsek (1991)]. We show that changes in
monetary policy produce a a substantial change in per-
sistence of interest rates, specially for short-term interest
rates.

II. BRIEF LITERATURE REVIEW

Recent research has studied whether long-range depen-
dence in asset returns and volatility changes over time,
and has provided evidence of time-varying long-range de-
pendence (Cajueiro and Tabak, 2004,2005). Nonethe-
less, while the presence of long-range dependence in as-
set returns and returns volatility seems to be an styl-
ized fact[22], only few papers have provided empiri-
cal evidence of long-range dependence in interest rates
[Backus and Zin (1993), Tsay (2000), Barkoulas and
Baum (1998), McCarthy et al. (2004), Sun and Phillips

(2004), Duan and Jacobs (1996, 2001), Cajueiro and
Tabak (2006a, 2006b)].

This paper contributes to the literature by studying
changes in long-range dependence parameters in interest
rates time series. We focus on the Brazilian economy
due to recent changes that occurred in monetary policy,
with the adoption of an inﬂation targeting regime and a
ﬂoating exchange rate regime.

III. MEASURES OF LONG-RANGE
DEPENDENCE

There are several methods that may be used to take
into account the long range dependence phenomena[23].
However, in spite of the existence of several methods, the
task of calculation the Hurst exponent is not straightfor-
ward and the methods sometimes present incompatible
estimations of the long range dependence parameter.

In this paper we follow two diﬀerent approaches. The
method introduced by Barab´asi and Vicsek (1991) and
used recently by Di Matteo et al. (2005b) to measure the
degree of market development of several ﬁnancial mar-
kets. According to Di Matteo et al. (2005b), it combines
sensitivity to any type of dependence in the data and
simplicity. Moreover, since it does not deal with max
and min functions, it is less sensitive to outliers than the
popular R/S statistics. And, also, the detrended ﬂuctua-
tion analysis (DFA) which was developed independently
in (Moreira et al, 2004) and (Peng et al, 2004) and pro-
vides an alternative for the determination of the Hurst
exponent.

A. Generalized Hurst exponent

Let Y (t) be the integrated time series of logarithm re-
turns, i.e., Y (t) = log (X(t)). The generalized Hurst ex-
ponent is a generalization of the approach proposed by
Hurst. Barab´asi and Vicsek (1991) suggest analyzing the
q-order moments of the distribution of increments, which
seems to be a good characterization of the statistical evo-

lution of a stochastic variable Y (t),

h|Y (t + τ ) − Y (t)|qi

,

where the time-interval τ can vary[24]. The generalized
Hurst exponent can be deﬁned from the scaling behavior
of Kq(τ ), which can be assumed to follow the relation

B. Detrended ﬂuctuation analysis

Let Y (t) be the integrated time series of logarithm re-
turns, i.e., Y (t) = log (X(t)). So, one considers the τ -
neighborhood around each point Y(t) of the time series.
The local trend in each τ -size box is approximated by a
polynomial[25] of order m, namely Z(t)).

Then, one evaluates the local roughness, namely

IV. DATA

The data considered here are interest rate swaps ma-
turing on 1, 3, 6 and 12 months’ time, which are the
maturities available for a “long time” span (more than
10 years of data). In these contracts, a party pays a ﬁxed
rate over an agreed principal and receives a ﬂoating rate
over the same principal, the reverse occurring with his or
her counterpart. There are no intermediate cash-ﬂows,
with the contracts being settled on maturity. The ﬂoat-
ing rate is the overnight CDI rate (interbank deposits),
which tracks very closely the average rate in the market
for overnight reserves at the central bank. The ﬁxed rate,
negotiated by the parties, is the one used on this paper.
These contracts have been traded over-the-counter in
Brazil since the early 90’s, and have to be registered ei-
ther on Bolsa de Mercadorias e de Futuros - BMF (a
futures exchange) or on Central de T´itulos Privados -
CETIP (a custodian).

We use data on interest rates swaps due to the lack of
good quality data on government bond indices for diﬀer-
ent maturities. Nonetheless, these interest rates are used
as benchmarks in the Brazilian ﬁnancial market.

The data is sampled daily, beginning on January 2,
1995 and ending on May 30, 2006. The full sample has
2828 observations, collected from the Bloomberg system.

V. LONG-RANGE DEPENDENCE IN THE
TERM STRUCTURE OF BRAZILIAN INTEREST
RATES

This section presents results for testing for long-range
dependence in interest rates for diﬀerent maturities. Ta-
ble 1 shows Hurst exponents estimated using both DFA
and GHE methods. We estimate these Hurst expo-
nents using the entire sample and also constructing two
sub-samples. The diﬀerences between monetary policy
regimes are striking, with Hurst exponents above 0.5 for
all maturities in the period before the implementation
of the inﬂation targeting regime and below 0.5 for ma-
turities up to 6 months after the implementation of this
regime. Panel D presents the diﬀerences in Hurst expo-
nents, which decrease monotonically with maturity, sug-
gesting that very little changed in the dynamics of the
1 year maturity interest rate. However, changes in 1-
month interest rates were substantial, and robust to the
methodology employed to estimate Hurst exponents.

Figure 1 presents Hurst exponents for the entire sam-
ple, using both the DFA and GHE methodology. These
Hurst exponents are decreasing but the diﬀerence in
Hurst exponents is small. However when we compare
Hurst exponents across monetary regimes the pattern
changes dramatically. Figures 2 and 3 present Hurst ex-
ponents for two diﬀerent monetary regimes, using the
DFA and GHE methods.

Two main conclusions emerge from these empirical
results. Hurst exponents show a substantial break in
the dynamics of persistence in Brazilian interest rates,
specially for short-term maturities.
Second, the pe-
riod before the implementation of the Inﬂation Targeting
Regime is characterized by a downward slope in the Term
Structure of Hurst exponents, while the period after the
implementation with an upward slope. 1 year maturity
interest rates do not present any evidence of a structural
break, which suggests that studying the term structure
of interest rates is worthwhile.

est rates. We show that Hurst exponents change substan-
tially with the implementation of the Inﬂation Targeting
Regime in 1999, reducing substantially interest rates per-
sistence afterwards.

The economic intuition for the empirical results is that
the previous monetary policy cycles that occurred within
the period before the implementation of the Inﬂation
Targeting regime have had a substantial change. This
is true because within an Inﬂation Targeting regime the
exchange rate is ﬂoating and therefore, the exchange rate
may absorb, at least partially, external shocks. When ex-
change rates are ﬁxed external shocks must be absorbed
by changes in domestic interest rates, and therefore, one
should expect interest rates to show more persistence.

This phenomenon is particularly true in our study,
because structural changes in interest rates were more
pronounced in short-term interest rates, with very lit-
tle changes in 1 year maturity interest rates (considered
long-term interest rates in Brazil).

Our results show that methods derived from econo-
physics may be able to help explain dynamics of impor-
tant macroeconomic and ﬁnancial variables such as in-
terest rates. Further research could focus on a variety of
countries that have adopted diﬀerent monetary regimes
and studying changes in persistence across regimes.

Abstract. The statistics of
transitions between the metastable states of a
periodically driven bistable Brownian oscillator are investigated on the basis of a two-
state description by means of a master equation with time-dependent rates. The
results are compared with extensive numerical simulations of the Langevin equation
for a sinusoidal driving force. Very good agreement is achieved both for the counting
statistics of the number of transitions and the residence time distribution of the
process in either state. The counting statistics corroborate in a consistent way the
interpretation of stochastic resonance as a synchronisation phenomenon for a properly
deﬁned generalized Rice phase.

1. Introduction

Time dependent systems that are in contact with an environment represent an important
class of nonequilibrium systems. In these systems eﬀects may be observed that cannot
occur in thermal equilibrium as for example noise-sustained signal ampliﬁcation by
means of stochastic resonance [1], or the rectiﬁcation of noise and the appearence
of directed transport in ratchet-like systems [2].
In the case of stochastic resonance
the transitions between two metastable states appear to be synchronized with an
external, often periodic signal that acts as a forcing on the considered system [3, 4].
This force alone, however, may be much too small to drive the system from one
state to the other. Responsible for the occurence of transitions are random forces
imposed by the environment in form of thermal noise. This kind of processes can
conveniently be modelled by means of Langevin equations which are the equations of
motion for the relevant degree (or degrees) of freedom of the considered system and
which comprise the inﬂuence of the environment in the form of dissipative and random
forces [5]. Unfortunately, neither the Langevin equations nor the equivalent Fokker-
Planck equations for the time evolution of the system’s probability density can be solved
analytically for other than a few rather special situations [6]. Therefore, most of the
prior investigations of stochastic resonance are based on the numerical simulation of
Langevin equations [1], or the numerical solution of Fokker-Planck equations either by
means of continued fractions [7] or Galerkin-type approximation schemes [8]. Analytical
results have been obtained in limiting cases like for weak driving forces [1], or very slow
driving [9].

Interestingly enough, the same qualitative features that had been known from
numerical investigations also resulted from very simple discrete models [10] that contain
only two states representing the metastable states of the continuous model. The
dynamics of the discrete states is Markovian and therefore governed by a master

transition rates of this master equation.
In recent work [11] it was shown that such
master equations correctly describe the relevant aspects of the long-time dynamics of
continuously driven systems with metastable states provided that the intrawell dynamics
is fast compared to both the driving and the noise activated transitions between the
metastable states.

In the present work we will pursue ideas [4] suggesting that a periodically driven
bistable system can be characterized in terms of a conveniently deﬁned phase that may
be locked with the phase of the external force, yielding in this way a more precise
notion of synchronization for such systems. Various possible deﬁnitions of phases for a
bistable Brownian oscillator have been compared in Ref. [4] with the main result that
the precise deﬁnition does not matter much. Therefore one will use the deﬁnition for
which it is simplest to determine the corresponding phase. If we think of the considered
system as of a particle moving under the inﬂuence of a stochastic and a driving force
in a bistable potential then the Rice phase provides a convenient deﬁnition under

the condition that the particle has a continuous velocity [12]. This phase counts the
number of crossings of the potential maximum separating the two wells. The necessary
continuity of the velocity is guaranteed if the hypothetical particle has a mass and obeys
a Newtonian equation of motion. The continuity of the velocity is lost if the particle
is overdamped and described by a Aristotelian equation of motion, i.e. by a ﬁrst order
diﬀerential equation for the position driven by a Gaussian white stochastic force. Then
the trajectories are known to be nowhere diﬀerentiable and to possess further level
crossings in the close temporal neighborhood of each single one.

We will allow for this jittering character of Brownian trajectories by setting two
diﬀerent thresholds on the both sides of the potential maximum and only count
alternating crossings. By deﬁnition, the generalized Rice phase increases by π upon each
counted crossing of either threshold. We will choose the threshold positions in such a
way that an immediate recrossing of the barrier from either threshold is highly unlikely.
Put diﬀerently, up to exceptional cases, the particle will move from the threshold to
the adjacent well rather than to immediately jump back over the barrier to the original
well.
In the two-state description of the process we then can identify the phase by
counting the number of transitions between the two states. With each transition the
phase then grows by π. In previous work [13] one of us gave explicit expressions for
various quantities characterizing the alternating point process, comprised of the entrance
times into the states of a Markovian two-state process with periodic time dependent
rates. The deﬁnition of the Rice phase in that paper was based on the statistics of the
entrance times into one particular state. Some of the statistical details then depend
on the choice of this state. To avoid this ambiguity we here base our deﬁnition on the
transitions between both states.

A further quantity that has been introduced in order to characterize stochastic
resonance is the distribution of residence times [14]. It is also based on the statistics of
the transition times and characterizes the duration between two neiboring transitions.
The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we introduce the model, formulate
the respective equivalent Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations and give the formal
solutions of the two-state Markov process with time dependent rates that follow from
the Fokker-Planck equation. In Section 3 several statistical tools from the theory of point
processes are introduced by means of which the switching behavior between of the master
equation can be characterized. Explicit expressions for various quantitative measures
in terms of the transition rates and solutions of the master equation are derived. These
are the ﬁrst two moments of the counting statistics of the transitions from which the
growth rate of the phase characterizing frequency synchronization, its diﬀusion constant
and the Fano factor [18] follow. Further, the probabilities for n transitions within one
period of the external driving force and an explicit expression for the residence time
distribution in either state are determined. In Section 3 these quantities are estimated
from stochastic simulations of the Langevin equations and compared with the results of
the two-state theory. The paper ends with a discussion.

2. Rate description of a Fokker-Planck process

We consider the archetypical model of an overdamped Brownian particle moving in a
symmetric double well potential U(x) = x4/4 − x2/2 under the inﬂuence of a time-
periodic driving force F (t) = A sin(Ωt). Throughout the paper we use dimensionless
units: mass-weighted positions are given in units of the distance between the local
maximum of U(x) and either of the two minima. The unit of time is chosen as the
−d2 ˜U (0)/dx2 of the potential ˜U(x) in
inverse of the so-called barrier frequency ω0 =
the original dimensional units. The particle’s dynamics then can be described by the
Langevin equation

where ξ(t) is Gaussian white noise, with hξ(t)i = 0 and hξ(t)ξ(s)i = δ(t−s). In the units
chosen the noise strength β/4 equals the barrier height of the static potential divided
by the thermal energy of the environment of the Brownian particle. The equivalent,
time-dependent Fokker-Planck equation describes the time-evolution of the probability
density ρ(x, t) for ﬁnding the process at time t at the position x

ρ(x, t) =

where the time-dependent potential V (x, t) describes the combined eﬀect of U(x) and
of the external time-dependent force F (t), i.e.,

V (x, t) = U(x) − xF (t).

We shall restrict ourselves to forces with amplitudes A being small enough such that
V (x, t) has three distinct extrema x1(t), x2(t) and xb(t) for any time t, where x1(t)
and x2(t) are the positions of the left and the right minima, respectively, and xb(t)
that of the barrier top. The barrier heights as seen from the two minima are denoted
by Vα(t) = V (xb(t), t) − V (xα(t), t) for α = 1, 2. We further assume that the particle
only rarely crosses this barrier. This will be the case if the minimal barrier height
Vm = mintVα(t) is still large enough such that βVm > 4.5. Under this condition the
time-scales of the interwell and the intrawell motion are widely separated and the long-
time dynamics is governed by a Markovian two-state process where the states α = 1, 2
represent the metastable states of the continuous process located at the minima at x1(t)
and x2(t) [11]. The transition rates rα,α′(t), i.e. the transition probabilities from the
state α′ to the state α per unit time, are time-dependent due to the presence of the
external driving. Explicit expression for the rates are known if the driving frequency is
small compared to the relaxational frequencies ωα(t), α = 1, 2 and ωb(t) that are deﬁned
by

In the limit of high barriers these rates take the form of Kramers rates for the
instantaneous potential [15], i.e.

r1,2(t) =

A more detailed discussion of the validity of these rates in particular with respect to
the necessary time-scale separation is given in Ref. [11]. More precise rate expressions
that contain ﬁnite-barrier corrections are known [15] but will not be used here.

In the semi-adiabatic regime both the time-dependent rates and the driving force
are much slower than the relaxational frequencies. Then the long-time dynamics of the
continuous process x(t) can be reduced to a Markovian two-state process z(t) governed
by the master equation with the instantaneous rates (5)

˙p1(t) = − r2,1(t)p1(t) + r1,2(t)p2(t)
˙p2(t) = r2,1(t)p1(t) − r1,2(t)p2(t)

where pα(t), α = 1, 2 denotes the probability that z(t) = α. These equations can
be solved with appropriate initial conditions to yield the following expressions for the
conditional probabilities p(α, t|α′, s) to ﬁnd the particle in the metastable state α at
time t provided that it was at α′ at the earlier time s ≤ t :

3. Statistics of transition times

The two-state process z(t) is completely determined by those times at which it switches
from state 2 into state 1, and vice versa from 1 to 2. These events constitute an
alternating point process ...tn < t∗
n < tn+1 < t∗
n+1 < . . . consisting of the two point
processes tn (2 → 1) and t∗
n (1 → 2), see Ref. [16]. This alternating point process can
be characterized by a hierarchy of multi-time joint distribution functions. Of these, we
will mainly consider the single and two-time distribution functions. The single-time
distribution function W (t) gives the averaged number of transitions between the two
states 1 and 2 in the time interval [t, t + dt), i.e., W (t)dt = h#{s|s = tn or s = t∗
n, s ∈
[t, t + dt)}i. This density of transition times is given by the sum of the entrance time
densities Wα(t) specifying the number of entrances into the individual state α

W (t) = W1(t) + W2(t).

The entrance time densities can be expressed in terms of the transition rates ρα,α′ and
the single time probabilities pα(t), see Ref. [13]

W1(t) = r1,2(t)p2(t)

and W2(t) = r2,1(t)p1(t).

The density W (t) determines the average number of transitions N(t, s) between the

two states within the time interval (t, s)

hN(t, s)i =

dt′ W (t′).

t

s
Z

In the limiting case described by the asymptotic probability pas
α (t), see eq. (9), the
entrance time densities W (t) also is a periodic function of time. Then, the average
hN(t, s)i becomes periodic with respect to a joint shift of both times t and s by a period
T

hN(t + T, s + T )i = hN(t, s)i

and, moreover, the number hN(s + nT, s)i is independent of the starting time s and
grows proportionally to the number of periods n.

There are two “two-time” transition distribution functions f (2)(t, s) and Q(2)(t, s)
that specify the average product of numbers of transitions within the inﬁnitesimal
interval [s, s + ds) and the number of transitions in the later interval [t, t + dt). These
two functions are to be distinguished by the behavior of the process between the two
times s and t. For the distribution function f (2)(t, s) the process may have any number

6

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

Transition times and phase diﬀusion

of transitions within the time interval [s + ds, t). It is given by the sum of the two-time
entrance distribution functions fα,α′(t, s)

f (2)(t, s) =

fα,α′(t, s)

Xα,α′

that determine the densities of pairs of entrances into the states α and α′ at the
prescribed respective times t and s. For t > s they can be expressed by the transition
rates and the conditional probability p( ¯α, t|α′, s), see Ref. [13]

fα,α′(t, s) = rα, ¯α(t)p( ¯α, t|α′, s)rα′, ¯α′(s)p ¯α′(s)

where the bar over a state, ¯α, denotes the alternative of this state, i.e. ¯1 = 2 and ¯2 = 1.
Note that the conditional probability p( ¯α, t|α′, s) allows for all possible realizations of
the two-state process starting with z(s) = α′ at time s up to the time t with any number
of transitions in between. For t < s the function fα,α′(t, s) follows from the symmetry
fα,α′(t, s) = fα′,α(s, t).

In the second two-time distribution function Q(2)(t, s) transitions at the times s
and t are taken into account only if no further transitions occur between the prescribed
times. It is again given by a sum of respective two-time distribution functions for the
individual transitions from 1 to 2, and vice versa, and hence reads

Q(2)(t, s) =

Qα(t, s)

α
X

where the two-time entrance distribution function

Qα(t, s) = rα, ¯α(t)P ¯α(t|s)r ¯α,α(s)pα(s)

gives the density of an entrance into the state ¯α at time s and an entrance into state
α at time t conditioned upon processes z(t′) = ¯α, s < t′ < t that stay constant in the
time between s and t. Therefore, these distribution functions depend on the waiting
time distribution in the state ¯α as given by eq. (12), see also Ref. [13].

According to the theory of point processes, see Ref. [17], the second moment of the
number of transitions within the time interval [s, t) results from the two-time distribution
function f (2)(t, s) as

hN 2(t, s)i = hN(t, s)i + 2

ds′f (2)(t′, s′).

Subtracting the squared average number hN(t, s)i2 one obtains the second moment of
the number ﬂuctuations h(δN(s + τ, s))2i.
It is given by an analogous expression as

Transition times and phase diﬀusion

asymptotically periodic, the two-time distribution function factorizes into the product
W (t)W (s) and g(t, s) vanishes. Consequently, the double integral on the right hand side
of the eq. (22) grows linearly with t in the asymptotic limit (t − s) → ∞. This leads to
a diﬀusion of the transition number ﬂuctuations, i.e. an asymptotically linear growth
that can be characterized by a diﬀusion constant:

which is a periodic function of the initial time s with the period T = 2π/Ω of the external
driving force. This time-dependence reﬂects the non-stationarity of the underlying
process. The diﬀusion constant D(s) is proportional to the variance of the transition
number ﬂuctuations during a period of the process z(t) in the asymptotic periodic limit

D(s) = lim
τ →∞

hδN 2(s + τ, s)i
2τ

D(s) =

hδN 2(T + s, s)ias
2T

where h ias indicates the average in the asymptotic ensemble. In principle, one can shift
the window [s, T + s) where the transition number ﬂuctuations are determined in such
a way that the diﬀusion constant D(s) attains a minimum. In the sequal we will not
make use of this possibility. Superimposed on the linear growth of hδN 2(t, s)i there is
a periodic modulation in t with the period T .

The comparison of the ﬁrst moment of the number of entrances and the second

moment of its ﬂuctuations yields the socalled Fano factor F (s) [18]; i.e.,

F (s) = lim
τ →∞

hδN 2(s + τ, s)i
hN(s + τ, s)i

=

hδN 2(s + T, s)ias
hN(s + T, s)ias

.

It provides a quantitative measure of the relative number ﬂuctuations and it assumes
the value F (s) = 1 in the case of a Poisson process. Here, it is a periodic function of s
which attains minima at the same time s as D(s).

As already mentioned in the introduction, the number of transitions between the
two states can yet be given another interpretation as a generalized Rice phase of the
random process x(t). At each time instant the process has switched to another state the
phase grows by π. The simplest deﬁnition would be the linear relation Φ(t, s) = πN(t, s)
where we the phase is set to zero at the initial time t = s. With this deﬁnition the phase
changes stepwise. A linear interpolation would lead to a continuously varying phase, but
will not be considered here. Independently from its precise deﬁnition, in the asymptotic
periodic regime, both the average and the variance of the phase increase linearly in time,
superimposed by a modulation with the period of the driving force.

A further coarse-graining of the considered periodically driven process can be
obtained by considering the number of transitions during an interval [s, t). By pα(n; t, s)
we denote the probability that the process assumes the value z(s) = α at time s and
undergoes n transitions up to the time instant t > s. Keeping in mind the signiﬁcance of
the waiting time distributions Pα(t|s) (7) as the probability of staying uninterruptedly
in the state α and of the transition rates rα,β(t) as the probability per unit time of a

where the states α and ¯α are opposite to each other. The probabilities with values of
n > 0 can be determined recursively from the following set of diﬀerential equations:

pα(n + 1; t, s) = − rαn+1,αn(t)pα(n + 1; t, s) + rαn,αn−1(t)pα(n; t, s)

The hierarchy starts at n = 0 with pα(0; t, s) as deﬁned in eq. (27). Accordingly, the
probability P (n; t, s) of n transitions within the time intervall [s, t) the sum of the
individual probabilities pα(n, t, s)

P (n; t, s) = p1(n; t, s) + p2(n; t, s).

Finally, we like to emphasize that with the information at hand also the
distributions of residence times can be determined. The residence times, say of the
state α, are deﬁned as the duration of the subsequent episodes in which the process
dwells in state α without interruption. For a nonstationary process these times must
not be confused with the life times of this state. Rather, the distribution of the residence
times Rα(τ ) is the life-time distribution in the state α averaged over the starting time
with the properly normalized entrance density into the considered state [19, 20], i.e.,

Rα(τ ) =

Here we assumed that the process has reached its asymptotic periodic behavior and
expressed the entrance time distribution according to eq. (14). The denominator
guarantees for the proper normalization of the residence time distribution.

4. Simulations

We always started the numerical simulations of the Langevin equation at the left
minimum x = −1 at time t = 0 and determined the ﬁrst switching time t1 as the
ﬁrst instant of time at which the value x = 1/2 was reached. The switching time t∗
1 to
the left well was deﬁned as the ﬁrst time larger than t1 at which the opposite threshold
at x = −1/2 was reached. For t2 we waited until the positive threshold at x = 1/2 was
again crossed, and so on. In this way a series of switching times t1, t∗
2, t3, . . . was

1, t1, t∗

generated. We stopped the simulations after the time at which either 104 or at least
103 periods of the driving force and at least 500 transitions to the right hand side of
the potential had occured. The left and right thresholds were taken in such a way that
any multiple counting due to the inherent irregularities of the Langevin tracjectories
was excluded. Because of the time-scale separation between the inter- and intra-well
dynamics the precise value of the thresholds at x = ±1/2 is immaterial as long as they
stay in a ﬁnite distance from the top of the barrier. Then a fast return of a trajectory
to the previously occupied metastable state after a crossing of the threshold can safely
be excluded.

P

In the simulations the amplitude of the force was always A = 0.1. For the frequency
we considered the two values Ω = 10−3 and Ω = 10−4 and the inverse temperature β
was varied from 20 to 55 in integer steps. Note again that the barrier height of the
reference potential U(x) is β/4 in units of the thermal energy. In Fig. 1 the numbers of
(Θ(t − ti) + Θ(t − t∗
transitions N(t) ≡ N(t, 0) =
i )) up to a time t as a function of
t are depicted for diﬀerent inverse temperatures together with averages estimated from
the full trajectory and those averages following from the two-state model, see eq. (15).
The average growth behavior is determined by the average number of transitions per
period in the asymptotic state, hN(T + s, s)ias, which is independent of s. In Fig. 2
the estimated value of this number is compared with the two-state model prediction as
a function of β. The agreement between theory and simulations is excellent even for
the relatively high temperature values and corresponding low transition barriers for the
values of β < 25. The average number of transitions monotonically decreases with falling
temperature. At the temperature where hN(T + s, s)ias = 2 the system is optimally
synchronized with the driving force in the sense that the Rice phase increases by 2π per
period of the driving force. This optimal temperature depends on the driving frequency
and becomes lowered for slower driving. In the vicinity of the optimal temperature the
decrease of hN(T +s, s)ias with inverse temperature is smallest. The emerging ﬂat region
resembles the locking of a driven nonlinear oscillator and becomes more pronounced for
smaller driving frequencies.

The ﬂuctuations of the number of transitions δN(t) ≡ N(t, 0) − hN(t, 0)i for times
up to t = 500T in a single simulation together with the theoretical average following
from eq. (22) are shown in Fig. 3. The average behavior is characterized by the number
ﬂuctuations per period δN 2(T, 0). This quantity was estimated from the simulations
as a function of the inverse temperature. In Fig. 4 we compare the prediction of the
two-state model, see eq. (22) with numerics. These number ﬂuctuations exhibit a local
minimum very close to the optimal temperature where two transitions per period occur
on average, see Figs. 2 and 4. This minimum is more pronounced for the lower driving
frequency. The ﬂuctuations of the Rice phase also assume a minimum at this optimal
temperature. This means that the phase diﬀusion is minimal at this temperature.

For the Fano factor F (0) we obtain an absolute minimum near the optimal
temperature, see Fig. 5. For higher temperatures the Fano factor may become larger
than one, whereas it approaches the Poissonian value F = 1 for low temperatures

Figure 1. The number of transitions N (t)
accumulated from 0 up to time t as a function
of t for simulations with the driving strength
A = 1, driving period Ω = 10−3, and inverse
temperatures β = 25 (red), 30 (blue) and 35
(green) is depicted together with the average
behavior (black straight lines) resulting from the
two-state theory, see eq. (15). Note that the
observed deviations apparently are smallest for
the middle inverse temperature β = 30. The
mean value hN (t)i obtained from the simulations
as the average over all available periods is
compared with the theoretical prediction in
eq. (15).

Figure 2. The average number of transitions
hN (T )i ≡ hN (T, 0)i occuring in one period is
shown as a function of the inverse temperature
for the two driving frequencies Ω = 10−3
(red ×) and 10−4 (blue +) ans the driving
strength A = 0.1. The symbols representing
the results of the simulations nicely fall onto the
respective theoretical curves shown as black lines.
At the temperatures (thin black vertical lines)
where hN (T )i assume the value 2 indicated by
the thin black horizontal line, the dynamics is
optimally synchronized with the external driving
force. For the smaller frequency the average
number of transitions ﬂattens around this optimal
temperature value indicating a tighter locking of
the transitions with the external driving force.

because then, transitions become very rare and independent from each other. Also
here, theory and simulations agree indeed very well.

Next, we consider the probabilities P (n) = P (n; T, 0) for ﬁnding N(T, 0) = n
transitions per period in the asymptotic, periodic limit. For this purpose we count the
number k of transitions within each period [nT, (n + 1)T ) and determine their relative
frequency occurring in a simulation. A comparison with the prediction of the two-
state model determined from the numerical integration of eq. (27) and from eq. (30) is
collected in Fig. 6 for diﬀerent temperature values. The agreement between simulations
and theory is within the expected statistical accuracy. For large temperatures there is a
rather broad distribution of n-value around a most probable value n∗. With decreasing
temperature, the most probable value moves to smaller numbers whereby the width of
the distribution shrinks. Once n∗ = 2 the probability P2(T ) further increases at the
cost of the other k values with decreasing temperature until k = 0 gains the full weight
in the limit of low temperatures.

The degree of synchronization of the continuous bistable dynamics with the external
driving force can be characterized by the value of the probability p2(T ). As a function
of the inverse temperature β it has a maximum close to the corresponding optimal

found from the synchronization of the averaged
phase (see Fig. 2). They coincide remarkably well
with the positions of the minima of hδN 2(T )i.
So we ﬁnd that at the optimal temperature also
the ﬂuctuations of the number of transitions and
consequently of the generalized Rice phase are
suppressed.

phase ﬂuctuations, the Fano factor F = F (0) is

Symbols are the same as in Fig. 2. The minimum
positions of the Fano factor again nicely coincide
with the optimal temperature values indicated by
the thin black lines. With decreasing frequency
these minima move to lower temperatures and
become broader and deeper. For suﬃciently low
temperatures the transitions become very rare
and almost Poissonian leading to the asymptotic
low temperature limit F = 1.

temperature and its value is higher. Fig. 8 depicts p2(T ) as a function of the frequency
at a ﬁxed temperature. It has a maximum at some optimal value of the frequency.

Finally, we come to the residence time distributions which can be estimated from
histograms of the simulated data. In the Fig. 9 these histograms are compared with
the results of the two-state model. Theory and simulations are in good agreement and
show a transition from a multimodal distribution with peaks at odd multiples of half the

Figure 6. The probabilities P (n) = P (n; T, 0) are shown for the driving the driving strength A = 0.1
and the driving frequency Ω = 10−4; for two temperatures that are higher than the optimal one
corresponding to β ≈ 40 in panel (a) and and for the optimal and a lower temperature in panel (b). As
one expects for a good synchronization of the system with the driving force at the optimal temperature
one ﬁnds two transitions per period with about 90% of the total weight. For high temperatures the
distribution becomes rather broad with a maximum at some large number of transitions. On the
contrary, for low temperatures the probability is largest at n = 0 and decreases with n. The agreement
of the two-state theory with the simulations is remarkably good.

taking place at the inverse temperature β = 40 the distribution is also monomodal with
its maximum close to half the period.

5. Discussion and conclusions

In this work we investigated the statistics of transitions between the two states of a
periodically driven overdamped bistable Brownian oscillator. We compared results from
extensive numerical simulations with theoretical predictions of a discrete Markovian
two-state model with time-dependent rates. For the studied slow driving frequencies
the rates can be taken as the adiabatic, or frozen rates. Although the minimal barriers
separating the states from each other may become rather small when measured in units
of the thermal energy (βVmin ≈ 4 for the lowest inverse temperature β = 20) we did
not take into account ﬁnite barrier corrections for the rates and still obtained very
good agreement for all considered quantities even at the highest chosen temperatures.
We considerd diﬀerent quantities from the counting statistics of transitions such as the
averaged and variance as well as the probabilty of a given number of transitions in one
period. These quantities are directly related to the average Rice phase, its diﬀusion and
the probability of a given increase of this phase. We note that appart from the average
phase these quantities depend on the position of the chosen period for which we took
s = 0 as the starting time. Another, more sophisticated, way of analyzing the counting
statistics would have been to position the averaging window of the length of a period
such that the variance of the number of transitions is minimal. But already with the
present simpler method we could detect signiﬁcant signatures of synchronization in a
noisy nonlinear system such as the locking of frequency and phase which both occure at

basically the same parameter values.

The novel analytical expression for the residence time distribution derived for the

two-state model also agrees very well with the simulation results.

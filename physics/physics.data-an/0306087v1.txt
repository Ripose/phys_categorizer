Reconstruction of electrons with the Gaussian-sum ﬁlter in the CMS
tracker at LHC

The bremsstrahlung energy loss distribution of electrons propagating in matter is highly non Gaussian. Because
the Kalman ﬁlter relies solely on Gaussian probability density functions, it might not be an optimal reconstruc-
tion algorithm for electron tracks. A Gaussian-sum ﬁlter (GSF) algorithm for electron track reconstruction in
the CMS tracker has therefore been developed. The basic idea is to model the bremsstrahlung energy loss dis-
tribution by a Gaussian mixture rather than a single Gaussian. It is shown that the GSF is able to improve the
momentum resolution of electrons compared to the standard Kalman ﬁlter. The momentum resolution and the
quality of the estimated error are studied with various types of mixture models of the energy loss distribution.

1. Introduction

Modern track detectors based on semiconductor
technologies contain larger amounts of material than
gaseous detector types, partially due to the detector
elements themselves and partially due to additional
material required for on-sensor electronics, power,
cooling, and mechanical support. A precise mod-
elling of material eﬀects in track reconstruction is
therefore necessary to obtain the best estimates of
the track parameters. Such material eﬀects are par-
ticularly relevant for the reconstruction of electrons
which, in addition to ionization energy loss and multi-
ple Coulomb scattering, suﬀer from large energy losses
due to bremsstrahlung.

A well-known model of the bremsstrahlung energy
loss is due to Bethe and Heitler [1].
In this model,
the probability density function (PDF), f (z), of the
energy loss of an electron is

f (z) =

c−1

,

[− ln z]
Γ(c)

(1)

where c = t/ ln 2, t is the thickness of material tra-
versed by the electron (in units of radiation length),
and z is the fraction of energy remaining after the
material layer is traversed. The probability of a given
fractional energy loss is assumed to be independent
of the energy of the incoming particle. This PDF is
shown in Fig. 1 for diﬀerent thickness values.

The baseline for track reconstruction in the CMS
tracker is the Kalman ﬁlter [2]. Throughout the ﬁlter
tracks are described by a ﬁve-dimensional state vec-
tor, containing the information about the momentum,
the direction and the position at some reference sur-
face. The material eﬀects are currently assumed to
be concentrated in the active elements of the detector
layers. In this context the optimal treatment of ra-
diative energy loss is to correct the momentum with

the mean value of energy loss and to increase the vari-
ance of the momentum by adding the variance of the
energy loss distribution. This procedure should en-
sure unbiased estimates of the track parameters and
of the associated uncertainties [3]. The Kalman ﬁlter
is a linear least-squares estimator, and is proved to be
optimal only when all probability densities encoun-
tered during the track reconstruction procedure are
Gaussian. The implicit assumption of approximating
the Bethe-Heitler distribution with a single Gaussian
is quite crude.
It is therefore plausible that a non-
linear estimator which takes the actual shape of the
distribution into account can do better.

A non-linear generalization of the Kalman ﬁlter
(KF), the Gaussian-sum ﬁlter (GSF) [4, 5], has there-
fore been implemented in the reconstruction software
of the CMS tracker [6]. In the GSF the distributions of
all state vectors are Gaussian mixtures, i.e. weighted
sums of Gaussians instead of single Gaussians. The
algorithm is therefore appropriate if the probability
densities involved in track reconstruction can be ad-
equately described by Gaussian mixtures. The basic

idea of the present work is to approximate the Bethe-
Heitler distribution as a Gaussian mixture rather than
a single Gaussian, in which the diﬀerent components
of the mixture model diﬀerent degrees of hardness of
the bremsstrahlung in the layer under consideration.
The resulting estimator resembles a set of Kalman
ﬁlters running in parallel, where each Kalman ﬁlter
corresponds to one of the components of the mixture
describing the distribution of the state vector.

An important issue with the GSF reconstruction of
electrons is to obtain a good Gaussian-mixture ap-
proximation of the Bethe-Heitler distribution. The
parameters to be obtained are the weights, the mean
values and the variances of each of the components in
the approximating mixture. The parameters are de-
termined by minimizing the following two distances:

DCDF =

|F (z) − G(z)| dz,

DKL =

ln [f (z)/g(z)] f (z)dz,

where f (z) and F (z) are the PDF and cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of the model distribution
and g(z) and G(z) are the PDF and CDF of the Gaus-
sian mixture, respectively. The distance DKL is the
so-called Kullback-Leibler distance between the model
distribution and the mixture. Hereafter, the mix-
tures obtained by minimizing DCDF are called CDF-
mixtures, whereas the mixtures obtained by minimiz-
ing DKL are called KL-mixtures. The minimizations
have been done independently on a set of discrete val-
ues of t, ranging from 0.02 to 0.20. Figures 2 and 3

trary values of the thickness, ﬁfth-degree polynomials
have been ﬁtted to the parameters as a function of
t. Due to the fast access to the parameters from the
polynomials, the calculation of the mixture is done
on the ﬂy during reconstruction, using the eﬀective
thickness of a detector layer from the knowledge of
the incident angle of inclination.

3. Reducing the number of components

The approximation of energy loss by a Gaussian
mixture amounts to a convolution of this mixture with
the current state, which in general is also composed
of several Gaussian components. The strict applica-
tion of the GSF algorithm therefore quickly leads to a

prohibitively large number of components due to the
combinatorics involved each time a layer of material
is traversed.

In a realistic implementation of the GSF the num-
ber of components must repeatedly be reduced to a
predeﬁned maximum. As little information as possi-
ble should be lost in this procedure. Two strategies
have been tested:

1. Only the N components with the largest weights

are kept;

2. Components are merged into clusters, according

to a given metric.

The ﬁrst option has the advantage of being compu-
tationally light, but it turns out to be inferior. Even
the ﬁrst two moments of the estimated parameters are
not described correctly.

In the second approach, the component with the
largest weight is merged with the one closest to it,
and this procedure is repeated until the required num-
ber of components is reached. The results below have
been obtained by using the Kullback-Leibler distance
– deﬁned in Equation (3) – as a measure of distance.

4. Results from simulated tracks in the
CMS tracker

First, results from the reconstruction of data origi-
nating from a simpliﬁed simulation are shown. In this
simulation multiple scattering and ionization energy
loss are turned oﬀ, all the material is concentrated on
the detector units, and the exact amount of material
used in the simulation is known by the reconstruction
program. Single electron tracks with pT = 10 GeV/c
have been simulated for absolute values of η less than
1.0 . Reconstructed hits have been collected using
the knowledge of the associated simulated hits, so no
pattern recognition has been involved. The following
results all refer to the quantity q/p (charge over abso-
lute value of the momentum) recorded at the point of
closest approach to the vertex in the transverse plane
– the transverse impact point (TIP) – after a ﬁt go-
ing from the outside towards the inside of the tracker.
Figure 4 shows an example of the estimated q/p for
one single track, both for the KF and for the GSF.

used both in the simulation of the disturbance of the
momentum in a detector unit and in reconstruction.
Keeping 36 components yields estimates quite close to
the correct distribution of the parameter.

Figure 4: Estimated q/p of one single track for the GSF
(solid), the KF (dashed) and the combined GSF state
(dotted). The combined GSF state refers to the ﬁrst and
the second moments of the GSF estimate, here visualized
as a single Gaussian. The arrow denotes the true value of
q/p. It can be seen that the estimated PDF of the GSF
is a non-Gaussian function.

Figures 5 and 6 show probability distributions for
the estimated q/p of the KF and the GSF with a
varying maximum number of components kept dur-
ing the reconstruction. Given the estimated PDF (a
single Gaussian for the KF, a Gaussian mixture for
the GSF), each entry in the histogram amounts to

the estimated PDF is a correct description of the real
distribution of the parameter, the corresponding his-
togram should be ﬂat.

The deviation from ﬂatness can be quantiﬁed by the
χ2 of the diﬀerence between the probability distribu-
tions of q/p and the ﬂat distribution. This χ2 per bin
is shown in Fig. 7 for a set of diﬀerent mixtures as a
function of the maximum number of components kept.

Figure 6: Probability distribution for the estimated q/p

(dotted) components kept during reconstruction. The
same six-component mixture as the one described in the
caption of Fig. 5 has been used in reconstruction, but the
simulation of the disturbance of the momentum in a
detector unit has been done by sampling from the
Bethe-Heitler distribution. The distributions for the GSF
are seen to be less ﬂat than those shown in Fig. 5.

The CDF-mixtures are superior to the KL-mixtures
concerning the quality of the estimated q/p. The main
trend seems to be related to the maximum number of
components kept rather than the number of compo-
nents in the mixture describing the energy loss, even
though the mixtures with ﬁve and six components are
best in the limit of keeping a large number of compo-
nents.

ability distribution of the GSF exhibits no large de-
viation from ﬂatness, indicating that the estimated
PDF of q/p describes reasonably well the actual PDF
of q/p. This observation is all the more remarkable
since, with the full simulation, the energy loss is not
generated by the simple Bethe-Heitler model, and nei-
ther the exact amount nor the exact location of the
material are known to the GSF.

The corresponding residuals of the estimated q/p
with respect to the true value are shown in Figs. 13
and 14. The residuals shown in Fig. 14 have been
obtained by including a vertex constraint in the ﬁt.
Such a constraint allows the momentum to be mea-
sured in the innermost part of the track and thus
gives a handle on possible radiation in the ﬁrst two
layers. The result of including this constraint is a less
skew distribution with the mode being moved closer
towards zero, and the amount of tracks in the tails is
also reduced. Even though the results from the full
simulation qualitatively seem to conﬁrm those from
the simpliﬁed simulation, more studies are needed to
understand the diﬀerences in detail.

location are known to the reconstruction program. It
has been shown that the quality of the momentum
estimate depends mainly on the number of mixture
components kept during reconstruction, and to some
extent also on the number of components in the mix-
ture approximation to the energy loss distribution.
A comparison with the best linear unbiased estima-
tor, the Kalman ﬁlter, shows a clear improvement of
the momentum resolution. Remarkably, a similar im-
provement can be seen with electron tracks from the
full simulation, although in this case neither the exact
energy loss distribution nor the precise amount and
location of material are known to the reconstruction
program. More systematic studies with electrons from
the full simulation are clearly needed, but it seems
safe to conclude that in electron reconstruction the
Gaussian-sum ﬁlter yields a substantial gain in preci-
sion as compared to the Kalman ﬁlter.

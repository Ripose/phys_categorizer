Fourier spectral estimates and, to a lesser extent, the autocorrelation

function are the primary tools to detect periodicities in experimental data in

the physical and biological sciences. We propose a new method which is more

reliable than traditional techniques, and is able to make clear identiﬁcation

of periodic behavior when traditional techniques do not. This technique is

based on an information theoretic reduction of linear (autoregressive) models

so that only the essential features of an autoregressive model are retained.

These models we call reduced autoregressive models (RARM). The essential

features of reduced autoregressive models include any periodicity present in

the data.

We provide theoretical and numerical evidence from both experimental

and artiﬁcial data, to demonstrate that this technique will reliably detect

periodicities if and only if they are present in the data. There are strong

information theoretic arguments to support the statement that RARM de-

tects periodicities if they are present. Surrogate data techniques are used to

ensure the converse. Furthermore, our calculations demonstrate that RARM

I. INTRODUCTION

Periodic, and nearly periodic, behavior is a common feature of many biological and

physical systems and there exist several widely-used techniques to estimate the period of

a behavior, for example, spectral estimation [1], autocorrelation [1], spectrographs, band

pass (comb) ﬁlters [2] and wavelet transforms [3,4]. All of these standard techniques either

employ, or are related to, or are a generalization of, Fourier series.

In this paper we propose an alternative method of detecting periodicity that is not so

closely related to Fourier series. This new technique applies ideas from information theory

to linear autoregressive models of time series to extract evidence of periods.

The basic principle is the following. Given a time series {yt}N

t=1 one can propose a linear

autoregressive model AR(n) by

yt = a1yt−1 + a2yt−2 + a3yt−3 + . . . + anyt−n + et t = n + 1, n + 2, . . . , N.

(1)

where et are assumed to be independent and identically distributed random variables, which

are interpreted as the modeling errors [1,5]. Under these assumptions the maximum like-

lihood estimate of the parameters a1, a2, . . . , an can be written in terms of a covariance

function, and are therefore related to the autocorrelation function and Fourier spectrum.

It is common practice to determine the optimal size n of the model by using either the

Akaike [6] or the Schwarz [7] information criteria; this is done to avoid over-ﬁtting of the

time series [8]. It has recently been observed that a further optimization of an AR(n) model

may be possible by deleting some of the terms to obtain a model

yt = a0 + a1yt−ℓ1 + a2yt−ℓ2 + a3yt−ℓ3 + . . . + akyt−ℓk + et,

(2)

where,

2

1 ≤ ℓ1 < ℓ2 < ℓ3 < . . . < ℓk ≤ n.

ℓi ∈ Z+ i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , k.

The hope is to obtain a model that ﬁts the time series equally well, but has far fewer

parameters. Profound theoretical arguments, which are a codiﬁcation of Occam’s razor,

imply that if a reduced autoregressive model (RARM) is suitably optimized, then it is superior

to an equivalent autoregressive model AR(n). The key principle of this paper is that if one

has an optimized RARM, that is the RARM that has been reduced to only the essential

terms, then the parameters ℓ1, ℓ2, ℓ3, . . . , ℓk, often called lags, provide information about the

periodicity of the time series.

A practical procedure for obtaining an optimal reduced autoregressive model (RARM)

has been described by Judd and Mees [9]. This procedure was introduced in the more general

context of nonlinear modeling, but in the following section we describe brieﬂy the underlying

theory in the context of RARM.

The major part of this paper is aimed at presenting evidence that examining the lags of

an optimal RARM provides a more robust and accurate means of detecting periods in time

series than traditional spectral techniques. That is, the proposed technique unambiguously

identiﬁes periodicities even when spectral methods fail to do so, and furthermore, does not

falsely suggest the presence of periods when none are present. The evidence presented is a

combination of theoretical argument and numerical procedures, which are illustrated with

both artiﬁcial and experimental data.

An important numerical procedure that will be used to establish that the proposed

technique does not falsely identify periods is

surrogate data analysis. The principle of

surrogate data analysis is the following. From experimental data one generates artiﬁcial

data that are “similar” to the experimental data and satisfy a given hypothesis. One then

calculates a test statistic for each surrogate data set, and hence obtains an ensemble of

statistic values that estimate the distribution of the test statistic under the assumption that

the original data is consistent with the given hypothesis. One then compares the statistic

value of the original data with the estimated distribution of the surrogates.

If the data

3

has an atypical statistic value then the hypothesis will be rejected, otherwise it should be

accepted. In this paper we employ this technique to ensure that RARM procedures do not

spuriously identify periodicities in temporally uncorrelated surrogate data.

A. Minimum description length

The criteria we use for determining the optimal RARM is the minimum description

length. Occam’s razor recommends that the best description of a phenomenon is the shortest

description. This principle can be made rigorous using information theory, and the principle

was independently developed by Wallace [10] and Rissanen [11].

Operationally the principle is applied as follows. Suppose you have a time series {yt}N

t=1

given to a certain ﬁxed accuracy and that you wish to communicate the data to a colleague.

To send the raw data would require a certain number of bits. Alternatively, one could

build a predictive model, of the form (2) for example, and then send the model parameters

(to some precision), the initial ℓk observations, and the diﬀerences between the model’s

predictions and actual observations. Given this information your colleague can reconstruct

the original data. If the model of the time series is good, then the total number of bits

required for parameters, initial conditions and prediction errors is less than the number of

bits of raw data, because the diﬀerences between the predicted and actual observations are

smaller than the observations. The total number of bits sent in the second case is called the

description length, and the model that achieves the minimum description length is the one

recommended by the application of Occam’s razor. The dogma is that this model achieves

the best prediction of the data without over-ﬁtting.

In practice it is usually suﬃcient to estimate the description length of a model, rather

than calculate it in detail. An estimate will usually have the form

(description length) ≈ (number of data) × log (sum of squares of prediction errors)

+ (penalty for number and accuracy of parameters) .

4

Following Judd and Mees [9] the description length of a RARM can be estimated as

follows. Given a time series {yt}N

t=1 deﬁne a set of vectors {Vi}n

i=1 by

V0 = (1, 1, . . . , 1)T ,

V1 = (yn, . . . , yN −1)T ,

V2 = (yn−1, . . . , yN −2)T ,

Vj = (yn−j+1, . . . , yN −j)T ,

and deﬁne

Observe that if the model (2) is appropriate for the time series one can write

where B = (ℓ1, ℓ2, . . . , ℓk), VB = [Vℓ1|Vℓ2| · · · |Vℓk] is a matrix, and aB = (a1, a2, . . . , ak)T .

The maximum likelihood estimates of aB, that is, the values that minimize eT e, are given

by

Now each parameter aj must be sent to some precision δj, that is, the maximum likelihood

estimate of aj is “rounded-oﬀ” by an amount δj.

It can be shown [9] that the optimal

precisions δ = (δ1, δ2, . . . , δk), that is, the round-oﬀ for each aj that gives the minimum

description length, satisfy

Armed with this estimate of the description length of a RARM one can search over all

combinations of lags B = (ℓ1, ℓ2, . . . , ℓk) to obtain the optimal RARM, however, Judd and

Mees [9] describe a fast and eﬃcient method of doing this optimization.

II. DETECTING PERIODICITY USING OPTIMAL RARM

A function f is periodic with period τ if f (t) = f (t + τ ) for all t. A time series (assumed

stationary) has an (approximate) periodicity of period τ if yt ≈ yt+τ for all t, or, equivalently,

the autocorrelation ρ has a local maximum at τ . The reduced autoregressive model (2)

predicts the current value of a time series yt as a weighted average of the previous values,

that is, at the time steps ℓ1, ℓ2, . . ., and ℓk previous to t.

If a time series has periodic

behavior, then the lags ℓ1, ℓ2, . . . , ℓk should be (multiples of) the periods.

We claim that one can detect in time series a periodicity of period ≤ nM AX by the

following procedure, called the RARM procedure. For n = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , nM AX build optimal

reduced autoregressive models of the form (2) using the algorithm described by Judd and

6

Mees [9]. For each model in this sequence calculate its description length (4) and take as

the overall optimal model that model with the smallest description length. We claim that

if the overall optimal RARM is non-trivial, then the lags ℓ1, ℓ2, . . . , ℓk should be (multiples

of) the periods ≤ nM AX in the original time series if the time series is suﬃcient long.

In order to establish our claim we must demonstrate that

i. if the time series contains a period then the RARM procedure detects this periodic

behavior, and

series.

ii. if the RARM procedure detects a period then there is periodic behavior in the time

In section II A we provide a theoretical argument to establish the forward implication (i).

In section II B we discuss an essential procedure for ensuring (ii).

A. Forward implication (i)

The argument to establish the forward implication proceeds as follows. First, we observe

that a period in a time series will (regardless of whether it is linear or nonlinear) produce

a local maximum in the autocorrelation function ρ(τ ). Next it is shown below that, in the

optimization of a RARM of given maximum size n, the criterion for inclusion of a particular

term ajyt−ℓj in (2) is closely related to the magnitude of the autocorrelation at ℓj, ρ(ℓj).

Hence, if n is large enough, the optimal RARM will include a term corresponding to this

periodicity. Rissanen’s minimum description length criterion guarantees that provided the

time series is suﬃciently long this will always be the case and so the RARM procedure will

always detect periods that are present in a time series, provided the time series is suﬃciently

long.

The remainder of this section elaborates on the detail of this argument. A period τ in a

time series {yt}N

t=1 of N scalar measurements is a strong positive correlation between values

separated by τ time steps, i.e. the autocorrelation

has a local maximum at τ . Without loss of generality we may assume that y = 0, and

According to the algorithm of Judd and Mees [9], given Bk and a(k)

B , the next best term to

add to the model has the lag τ that maximizes L(τ ). However, identity (7) implies that

such a τ is a local maximum of ρ(τ ).

Rissanen’s minimum description length ensures that, for suﬃciently large N, “if there is

any machinery behind the data, which restricts the future observation in a similar manner

as the past and which can be captured by the selected class of parametric functions, then

we will ﬁnd that machinery” [11]. The argument in the preceding paragraphs demonstrates

that RARM are a suﬃciently broad class of parametric functions to capture “machinery”

behind the data, including observed periodicities. Thus, if periodicity is present in the data

then RARM techniques will detect it — provided N is suﬃciently large. This ensures the

forward implication (i).

8

B. Reverse implication (ii): Surrogate data techniques

In order to establish that the RARM techniques does not falsely identify a period when

none is present, the numerical procedure of surrogate data analysis can be used. The tech-

nique of surrogate data was originally introduced by Theiler and colleagues [12]. They

suggest three surrogate generation techniques to address three diﬀerent hypotheses about a

time series, but for our purposes we only use Theiler’s algorithm 0 surrogates.

In the present case we are interested in whether a time series contains periodicities, or

said in another way, we wish to test the null hypothesis that the time series contains no

periodicities, that is, has no temporal correlation. Theiler’s algorithm 0 generates surrogate

time series having no temporal correlation by simply shuﬄing the original time series, or

put another way, the surrogates are i.i.d. noise having the same same rank distribution as

the original time series [13].

Our proposal is to use optimal RARM as the test for periodicity, that is, if the optimal

RARM is non-trivial in that k > 0 in (2), then periods are present in the time series.

To believe the validity of this test one must require that if the optimal RARM detects a

period in a time series, then it must not detect any period in algorithm 0 surrogates [13,14].

This surrogate test must be applied to each data set for which an optimal RARM has been

constructed to ensure that the structure detected in each data set is genuine. That is, we

propose that an algorithm 0 surrogate test is a necessary part of the procedure of detecting

periodicity using an optimal RARM. If RARM methods identify periodicity in the surrogates

then this is clear evidence of false identiﬁcation of periodicity in the data. However, if the

RARM algorithm detects no periodicity in the surrogates then periodicity identiﬁed in the

original data is genuine. To ensure the reverse implication (ii) holds one need only apply an

algorithm 0 surrogate calculation.

III. CALCULATIONS

In this section we demonstrate with artiﬁcial and experimental data that RARM detects

periodic behavior (i) if and (ii) only if it is present in the original time series. To demonstrate

that RARM detects periodic behavior if it is present in the data we construct artiﬁcial data

contaminated with noise and demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the RARM algorithm. We

compare the RARM results to traditional Fourier spectral and autocorrelation techniques.

We repeat these calculations for some experimental data comparing the RARM algorithm

and traditional techniques. To demonstrate that our RARM algorithm detects periodic

behavior only if it is present in the data we apply the method of surrogate data.

In section III A we describe the application of these techniques to detect periodicities in

recordings of infant respiratory patterns during natural sleep. Section III B applies these

methods to artiﬁcial data sets to demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of these techniques compared

to traditional methods. Section III C describes the application of these same methods to

global climatic data.

A. Infant respiratory data

Using inductance plethysmography we have collected measurements of cross-sectional

area of the abdomen of infants during natural sleep. From these measurements we extract

a measure that can be related to the breath volume [15]. Figure 1 gives an example of data

collected in this way.

of the form

We applied our RARM procedure to the data illustrated in ﬁgure 1 and obtained a model

yt = a0 + a1yt−1 + a2yt−6 + et

(8)

where a0 ≈ 2.945206, a1 ≈ 0.300739 and a2 ≈ 0.202056. Figure 2 shows the result of analysis

of this data set with a fast Fourier transform algorithm (MATLAB’s spectrum command.)

and an estimate of the autocorrelation function. Both these techniques yield small peaks

10

at the same value (that is, 6) and are consistent with the results of our RARM algorithm.

However, the results are not as unambiguous as the results of the RARM algorithm. That

is, the RARM detects a periodicity that is not strong enough to be unambiguously identiﬁed

by spectral methods.

For many time series of breath size [16] we have computed autocorrelation and Fourier

spectral estimates. We have applied our RARM algorithm to each data set and compared

this to the result of applying traditional techniques. For these data the period of periodic

behavior detected by the RARM algorithm is consistent with the periods detected by auto-

correlation. That is, if RARM detects periodic behavior, then it is of the same period as that

detected by the autocorrelation estimate (if the autocorrelation detects periodic behavior).

Furthermore, if RARM does not detect periodic behavior, then neither does the autocorre-

lation estimate. The traditional techniques will often fail to detect periodic behavior when

the RARM algorithm does detect it.

We have provided experimental evidence that the RARM technique detects periodic

behavior when it does occur. Now we will demonstrate that the RARM technique does not

lead to spurious identiﬁcation of periodic behavior. That is, we will show that if the RARM

algorithm detects periodic behavior, then there is periodic behavior in the data. To do this

we apply a surrogate data algorithm which will ensure that false indications of periodicities

can always be identiﬁed.

For the data illustrated in ﬁgure 1, none of 100 surrogates generated by shuﬄing the data

exhibited periodic behavior of any period. This calculation was repeated with another 48

data sets [16]. In all 49 cases the RARM failed to detect periodic behavior in the surrogate

data in at least 99 (of 100) surrogates of each data set. This indicates that the RARM

algorithm does not identify periodicities not present in the data.

11

B. Artiﬁcial data

In this section we use the optimal RARM from section III A as a basis for generating

noisy artiﬁcial data with a known periodicity. From (8) we use the model

yt = a0 + a1yt−1 + a2yt−6 + et

(9)

(where a0 ≈ 2.945206, a1 ≈ 0.300739 and a2 ≈ 0.202056, as above) to generate an artiﬁcial

data set y. To this data we add observational noise ǫt and apply the above analysis to the

series z, zt = yt + ǫt. Figure 3 demonstrates the result of this technique for an artiﬁcial data

set of the same length as the data and normal observational noise with standard deviation 1

(et, ǫt ∼ N(0, 1)). Figure 4 is the result of the same technique for a longer data set (5000 data

points) and more observational noise (et ∼ N(0, 1) and ǫt ∼ N(0, 2)). In both cases RARM

clearly identiﬁed periodic behavior with period 6. For the time series in shown in ﬁgures

3 and 4 we constructed 100 algorithm 0 surrogates. none of them exhibited periodicity

detected by RARM.

The traditional Fourier spectral and autocorrelation techniques identify the same period

as the RARM technique for the shorter, but less noisy data illustrated in ﬁgure 3. However,

for the data shown in ﬁgure 4 the RARM technique has identiﬁed periodicities that are not

obvious from traditional techniques. Furthermore, it should be noted that in all cases that

the results of the autocorrelation and spectral methods are not clear cut. For reasonably long,

but extremely noisy data sets the RARM algorithm still provides a decisive and accurate

estimate of the period of periodic behavior present in data.

C. Global climatic data

In this section we describe the application of these techniques with noisy physical data.

The time series we use here is monthly deviations from monthly mean global air temperatures

over the period 1856–1997 [17]. These global air temperature measurements are obtained by

averaging observations at many spatially separated sites on the globe. Figure 5 shows the

12

complete data set. A more detailed discussion of this data may be found in [18]. Analysis

using the methods described in this paper demonstrates the presence of periodic ﬂuctuation

over periods of 7 months, 2 years and 45 months [19]. Fourier spectral and autocorrelation

estimates were also applied (after de-trending this time series) and the results are illustrated

in ﬁgure 5. From 100 algorithm 0 surrogates RARM did not detect periodicity in 99 of them.

These results demonstrate the presence of genuine periodic ﬂuctuation in this time series

and that the ﬂuctuation is diﬃcult to detect with traditional techniques. An advantage of

the RARM technique is that no de-trending is required. The results of the RARM algorithm

are not eﬀected by trends or non-stationarity.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have provided theoretical and experimental evidence to support the use of RARM

techniques to detect periodic behavior in noisy experimental time series. The concept of

minimum description length ensures that a RARM built with an MDL modeling criterion

will detect any periodicities present in the data. We provided numerical evidence using

experimental and artiﬁcial data to support this. Moreover these calculations have demon-

strated that the RARM algorithm provides an accurate and decisive method of detecting

periodicities that is more sensitive than Fourier spectrum or autocorrelation methods.

By applying surrogate data techniques we have demonstrated that the RARM algo-

rithm did not identify periodicities in temporally uncorrelated surrogates. This is strong

experimental evidence that the RARM algorithm is robust against identiﬁcation of false

periodicities. It does not identify behavior not present in the original system. However this

result has only been supported by numerical evidence and does not imply that true iden-

tiﬁcation with arbitrary data. To guard against false positives we recommend application

of surrogate data tests, as discussed in this paper. Periodicity detected using RARM are

genuine provided RARM detects no periodicity in i.i.d. surrogates.

relation function for the data illustrated in ﬁgure 1. The RARM detected periodic motion over a

period of 6 data points, see equation (8). A vertical dot-dashed line marks the location of period

6 behavior in both the frequency (power spectrum) and time (autocorrelation) domain. A peak in

the autocorrelation function corresponds exactly with the period 6 behavior detected by RARM.

The power spectrum has a peak close to a frequency of 6−1 ≈ 0.166667. A period of 6 is the closest

integer value to the peak evident at this location in the power spectrum. Whilst both power spectra

and autocorrelation detect behavior with a period of 6 these results are not as conclusive as the

RARM algorithm.

FIG. 3. Artiﬁcial data: A data set of 764 realization of the process described by (9) with

normal observational noise, standard deviation 1. This linear model is of the same form as that

predicted from the model of the data in ﬁgure 1. Also shown in the power spectrum (arbitrary units)

and autocorrelation estimate for this data set. For this data set RARM gave a clear indication

of period 6 behavior. The dot dashed line on the power spectrum and autocorrelation function

corresponds to the period of 6 detected by RARM.

FIG. 6. Spectral techniques: Estimates of the power spectrum and autocorrelation function

for the data illustrated in ﬁgure 5. The data in ﬁgure 5 was linearly de-trended before calculating

Fourier spectrum and autocorrelation. The RARM detected periodic motion over a period of 7, 24

and 45 months. A vertical dot-dashed line marks the location of period 7, 24 and 45 behavior in

both the frequency and time domain. A peak in the autocorrelation function corresponds exactly

with the period 24 and 45 behavior detected by RARM. The power spectrum has a peak close to a

frequency of 45−1 ≈ 0.0222. Whilst both power spectra and autocorrelation detect behavior with

a period of 24 and 45 these results are not as conclusive as the RARM algorithm.

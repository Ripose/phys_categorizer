Trend followers lose more often than they gain

We solve exactly a simple model of trend following strategy, and obtain the analytical shape of
the proﬁt per trade distribution. This distribution is non trivial and has an option like, asymmetric
structure. The degree of asymmetry depends continuously on the parameters of the strategy and
on the volatility of the traded asset. While the average gain per trade is always exactly zero, the
fraction f of winning trades decreases from f = 1/2 for small volatility to f = 0 for high volatility,
showing that this winning probability does not give any information on the reliability of the strategy
but is indicative of the trading style.

A question often asked by investors to fund managers, besides the average return of their strategies, is: “What is
your fraction of winning trades?” Implicitly, they expect the answer to be larger than 50% , as this would indicate
that the fund manager is more frequently right than wrong, and therefore trustworthy. We want to show in this
paper that this fraction is in fact meaningless. It depends entirely on the trading style of the manager, and tells very
little about the consistency of his returns. It is clear that one can make money on average even if the fraction f of
winning trades is low, provided the average gain per winning trade
.

The condition is, clearly:

exceeds the average loss per losing trade,

G

Since asset prices are very close to being pure random walks, any statistical signal exploited by systematic traders has
an extremely small signal to noise ratio. The average proﬁt per trade for any hedge fund is bound to be very small,
which means that the above inequality is close to an equality. If the typical holding period of winning trades is TG
and that of losing trades TL, one expects, for a random walk of volatility σ:

Therefore, the fraction of winning trades is in fact a measure of the ratio of the holding periods of winning trades to
that of losing trades:

For example, a 40% fraction of winning trades merely indicates that (unless the manager is really lousy) the typical
holding period of winning trades is
2 times that of losing trades. This, in turn, means that the manager is probably
mostly trend following, since by deﬁnition a trend following strategy stays in position when the move is favorable, but
closes it in case of adverse moves. Hence, conditioned to a winning trade, the holding period is clearly longer. The
opposite would be true for a contrarian strategy. Let us illustrate this general idea by two simple models. The ﬁrst
one is completely trivial and not very interesting besides driving our point home. The second model is much richer; it
can be solved exactly using quite interesting methods from the theory of random walks and leads to a very non trivial
distribution of proﬁts and losses. Besides its intrinsic interest, the model elegantly illustrates various useful methods
in quantitative ﬁnance, and could easily be used as a basis for a series of introductory lectures in mathematical ﬁnance.
The outcome of our calculations is that although the daily P&L of the strategy is trivial and reﬂects the statistics of
the underlying, the P&L of a given trade has an asymmetric, option-like structure!

The ﬁrst model is the following: suppose that the price, at each time step, can only move up +1 or down

1 with
1) and the previous
probability 1/2. The trend following strategy is to buy (sell) whenever the last move was +1 (
position was ﬂat, stay in position if the last move is in the same direction, and close the position as soon as the move
is adverse. Conditioned to an initial buy signal, the probability that the position is closed a time n later is clearly:

Let us now turn to our second, arguably more interesting model, where the log-price P (t) is assumed to be a
continuous time Brownian motion. This model has well known deﬁciencies: the main drawbacks of the model are
the absence of jumps, volatility ﬂuctuations, etc. that make real prices strongly non-Gaussian and distributions fat-
tailed [1]. However, for the purpose of illustration, and also because the continuous time Brownian motion is still
the standard model in theoretical ﬁnance, we will work with this model, which turns out to be exactly soluble. We
assume that on the time scale of interest, the price is driftless, and write:

where dW (t) is the Brownian noise and σ the volatility. From these log-returns, trend followers form the following
“trend indicator” φ(t), obtained as an exponential moving average of past returns:

where τ is the time scale over which they estimate the trend. Large positive φ(t) means a solid trend up over the last
τ days. Alternatively, φ(t) can be written as the solution of the following stochastic diﬀerential equation:

The strategy of our trend-follower is then as follows: from being initially ﬂat, he buys +1 when φ reaches the value
Φ (assuming this is the ﬁrst thing that happens) and stays long until φ hits the value
Φ, at which point he sells
1, and so on. An alternative model is to close the position when φ reaches
back and takes the opposite position
0 and remain ﬂat until a new trend signal occurs. The proﬁt G associated with a trade is the total return during
the period between the opening of the trade, at time to (φ(to) =
Φ) and the closing of the same trade, at time tc
(φ(tc) =
Φ). More precisely, assuming that he always keeps a constant investment level of 1 dollar and neglecting
transaction costs,

We are primarily interested in the proﬁt and loss distribution of these trend following trades, that we will denote
Q(G). A more complete characterization of the trading strategy would require the joint distribution Q(G, T ) of G on

the one hand, and of the time to complete a trade T = tc −
Obviously, G and φ evolve in a correlated way, since both are driven by the noise term dW . For deﬁniteness, we will
consider below the case of a buy trade initiated when φ = +Φ; since we assume the price process to be symmetric,
the proﬁt distribution of a sell trade is identical. Now, the trick to solve the problem at hand is to introduce the
conditional distribution P (g
φ, t) that at time t, knowing that the trend indicator in φ, the proﬁt still to be earned

We now proceed to solve Eq. (12). First, it is clear that all the results can only depend on the ratio Φ/σ√τ , i.e. on
the width of the trend following ‘channel’ Φ measured in units of the typical price changes over the memory time τ ,
that is, the order of magnitude of the expected gains of the trend following strategy. One expects in particular that
in the limit Φ/σ√τ
, the distribution of gains will become Gaussian, since the time needed to reach the edge
of the channel is then much larger than the memory time of the process. We will from now on measure Φ and G in
units of σ√τ , and therefore set σ2τ = 1 hereafter. Now, Fourier transforming P (g

From these expressions, one can reconstruct the whole distribution Q(G), that we now describe. As already
mentioned above, in the limit Φ
the distribution becomes Gaussian. As Φ decreases, the distribution becomes
more an more positively skewed: the fraction of winning trades decreases, but the average gain per winning trade
becomes larger. This is illustrated in Fig. 1 where we plot Q(G) for the intermediate case Φ = 1. It is clear that

. This can be done by observing that Ψλ(φ) has
poles for λ imaginary, corresponding to zeros of Wλ(
Φ). For Φ = 1, we ﬁnd that the zeros closest to λ = 0 are

showing again the strong asymmetry in the proﬁt and loss distribution.

The large λ behaviour of Ψλ(φ) is important to control, in particular to determine accurately the numerical Fourier

transform that gives Q(G). Using Eq. (21), we ﬁnd:

In the limit Φ

0, the distribution becomes maximally skewed. Since the sell threshold is so close to the buy
threshold, most events correspond to a small (O(2Φ)) immediate loss. Only with a small probability, also of order Φ,
is the strategy leading to an order 1 proﬁt. In the small Φ limit, one ﬁnds that the small λ expansion of Ψλ(φ) reads:

We have performed a numerical simulation of the above simple trend following strategy on the Swiss Franc against
Dollar, using 5358 days between 1985 and 2005, with τ = 5 days, and choosing the channel width Φ = σ2τ , where σ
is the historical volatility over the whole time period. The result for Q(G) is given in Fig. 2, and compared with the
theoretical prediction. The agreement is only qualitative, mostly due to the fact that the trading is in discrete time
(daily) and to non Gaussian character of the returns which makes the distribution Q(G) fatter than predicted by the
above model (see Fig. 3). However, the strong asymmetry is indeed observed; in particular, the loss probability is
found to be

0.605, not far from the theoretical prediction of 0.635.

Conclusion. We have therefore solved exactly a simple model for the proﬁt and losses of a trend following strategy,
and obtained the analytical shape of the proﬁt distribution per trade. This distribution turns out to be highly non
trivial and, most importantly, asymmetric, resembling the distribution of an option pay-oﬀ. The degree of asymmetry
depends continuously on the parameters of the strategy and on the volatility of the traded asset; while the average
gain per trade is always exactly zero, the fraction of winning trades decreases from f = 1/2 for small volatility to
f = 0 for high volatility, showing that this probability does not give any information on the reliability of the strategy
but is indicative of the trading style. In fact, we could repeat the same calculations as above for a ‘mean-reverting’
strategy, where the position of the trade is to sell when the trend indicator is high, and vice-versa. It is clear that
the distribution of gains in that case is the mirror image of that computed above; for a mean reverting strategy,
gains are more frequent than losses, but of a smaller amplitude. Note that the non trivial structure of the gain
distribution entirely comes from the conditioning on being associated to a given trade. If one asks, for example, for
the unconditional distribution of the daily returns of the strategy, then it is perfectly symmetrical and reproduces
exactly the return distribution of the underlying asset (see Fig. 3)!

Appendix: Duration of the trades

In this appendix, we give an alternative derivation of the gain distribution Q(G) which also allows to gather some
information on their duration. The method presented in the main text is elegant precisely because it gets rids of all
temporal aspects. Suppose that at t = 0 a buy trade is opened, with φ = +Φ. We will now focus on g′, the proﬁt
accumulated up to time t. Let us introduce the quantity R(φ, g′, t) as the probability that the trade is still open at
time t, has accumulated a proﬁt g′ and such that the trend indicator is φ. After Fourier transforming on g′, this
quantity admits the following path integral representation:

which, for φ = Φ is precisely the joint probability that the proﬁt of the trade is G and its duration is T (Fourier
transformed over G.) The integral over all G’s, corresponding to λ = 0, gives the unconditional distribution of trade
times. The result can be written in a fully explicit way if the trade closing condition is at φ = 0, in which case
the eigenvectors ψm are simply the odd levels of the harmonic oscillator and can be expressed in terms of Hermite
polynomials. More generally, the distribution of duration decays at large times as exp(
E0T /τ ), where E0 is the
ground state energy of the constrained Harmonic oscillator. One can also check that the integral over all T s of

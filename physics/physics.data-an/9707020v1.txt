Incorporation of the statistical uncertainty in
the background estimate into the upper limit
on the signal

Abstract

We present a procedure for calculating an upper limit on the number of signal events
which incorporates the Poisson uncertainty in the background, estimated from con-
trol regions of one or two dimensions. For small number of signal events, the upper
limit obtained is more stringent than that extracted without including the Poisson
uncertainty. This trend continues until the number of background events is com-
parable with the signal. When the number of background events is comparable or
larger than the signal, the upper limit obtained is less stringent than that extracted
without including the Poisson uncertainty. It is therefore important to incorporate
the Poisson uncertainty into the upper limit; otherwise the upper limit obtained
could be too stringent.

1 Introduction

In the search for a rare or forbidden process, an experiment usually observes
zero or few candidate events and sets an upper limit on the number of signal
events. The background is often estimated from control regions of one or two
dimensions. In the case of a small number of candidates events, it is important
to incorporate the uncertainty in the background estimate due to Poisson
statistics into the upper limit.

For Nob observed events with an expected background of Nbg events, the upper
limit on the number of signal events λ0 at a conﬁdence level δ is given by:

e−(λ0+Nbg )

assuming that there is no uncertainty in the background estimate [1,2]. In this
paper, we present a procedure for incorporating the statistical uncertainty in
the background estimate using Poisson statistics.

2 Incorporation of the statistical uncertainty

We consider the case in which the background is estimated from control regions
of one or two dimensions which have limited statistics. Figure 1(a) shows an
example of a signal and two sideband regions in the distribution of a physical
variable for the one-dimensional case. The corresponding example for the two-
dimensional case for the signal, four sideband and four corner-band regions is
shown in Fig. 1(b). Assuming that the background is linear in the vicinity of
the signal region, the background in the signal region can be estimated from
the number of events in the sideband (and corner-band if appropriate) regions.
The number of signal events N0 is given by:

N0 = Nob − Nbg ≡ Nob − αNsb + βNcb,

(2)

where Nsb (Ncb) is the number of events in the sideband (corner-band) regions.
For the one-dimensional case, α is the ratio of the width of the signal region to
the total width of the sideband regions and β is zero. In the two-dimensional
case, α is two times the ratio of the area of the signal region to the total area
of the sideband regions and β is the ratio of the area of the signal region to
the total area of the corner-band regions.

The extraction of the upper limit on the signal must account for the uncer-
tainty in the background estimate due to limited statistics in the control re-
gions. For the one-dimensional case, this is implemented by expanding Eq. (1)
to sum over all possible background values weighted by the Poisson proba-
bility for observing the Nsb background events given an expected number of
events λsb in the sideband regions. The upper limit on the number of signal
events λ at a conﬁdence level δ is given by:

can also be used to calculate the upper limit on the number of signal events for
the case in which the background is estimated from a Monte Carlo simulation.
In this case, Nsb is the number of background events that satisﬁed the event
selection criteria in a Monte Carlo sample that is α−1 times larger than the
data.

For control regions of two dimensions, the formula for the upper limit is much
more complicated. However, it can be simpliﬁed depending on the value of β.
In the case of β = 1 which corresponds a total corner-band area that is equal
to the area of the signal region, the upper limit is given by:

imenter may choose this kind of smaller background control regions so that
the background is more linear in the vicinity of the signal region. Substituting

3 Results

We have investigated the implication of including the Poisson uncertainty in
the estimated background in the calculation of upper limits. In Tables 1-3, we
give the 90% and 95% conﬁdence level upper limits on the signal with and
without including the Poisson uncertainty for several cases of small number
of observed events and various backgrounds. The control regions have been

chosen such that α = 1
4. In the calculation of λ0 with Eq. (1), the
background is set to zero if Ncb > 2Nsb. As expected, λ is identical to λ0 when
the number of events in the signal region is zero, regardless of the number of
estimated background events. However, λ is smaller than λ0 when the number
of events in the signal region is non-zero and the estimated background is zero.
This is not unexpected because Eqs. (6) and (7) allow for the estimated zero
background to ﬂuctuate up, in contrast to Eq. (1) in which the background is
estimated to be zero with no uncertainty. This trend continues until the num-
ber of background events is comparable with the signal. When the number
of background events is comparable or larger than the signal, the upper limit
obtained is less stringent than that extracted without including the Poisson
uncertainty in the estimated background. It is therefore important to incor-
porate the Poisson uncertainty into the upper limit; otherwise the upper limit
obtained could be too stringent.

For a large number of observed events, we can use the common assumption
that the signal N0 in Eq. (2) is normally distributed (Gaussian) with the
variance given by

area is δ of the area integrated to +∞. For an unphysical signal, N0 < 0,

the integration should be renormalized by setting N0 = 0 to obtain a more
conservative limit [2]. Tables 4-5 show a comparison of λG and λ for the case of
Nob = Nbg. Due to the longer tail of the Poisson distribution, λ is larger than
λG. The signiﬁcance of the diﬀerence diminishes with larger Nob. For example,
in the one-dimensional case, it decreases from ∼ 10% for Nob = 10 events to
∼ 5% for Nob = 50 events. For an experiment with small systematic error,
Eq. (6) or (7) should be used to compute the upper limit instead of using the
Gaussian approximation.

For completeness, we also listed in Tables 6-8 the 90% and 95% conﬁdence
level upper limits on the signal for α = β = 1 with and without including the
Poisson uncertainty in the estimated background for small number of observed
events and various backgrounds.

As noted in the previous section, Eq. (3) can also be used to calculate the up-

per limit on the signal for the case in which the background is estimated from
a Monte Carlo simulation. The impact of including the Poisson uncertainty
in the estimated background into the upper limit can be investigated by com-
paring the limit with that obtained without including the uncertainty. Table 9
lists the 90% conﬁdence level upper limits obtained with and without including
the Poisson uncertainty for several cases of small number of observed events
and various backgrounds. As in the previous examples, λ is smaller than λ0
for small number of observed events with comparable or smaller background.
However, λ is larger than λ0 for larger background. Not including the Poisson
uncertainty leads to a too stringent limit in this case.

4 Conclusion

We have presented a procedure for calculating an upper limit on the number
of signal events which incorporates the Poisson uncertainty in the background
estimated from control regions of one or two dimensions. For small number of
observed events in the signal region, the limit obtained is more stringent than
that extracted assuming no uncertainty in the estimated background. This
trend continues until the number of background events is comparable with
the signal. When the number of background events is comparable or larger
than the signal, the upper limit obtained is less stringent than that extracted
without including the Poisson uncertainty in the estimated background. It

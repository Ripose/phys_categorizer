We apply the Google PageRank algorithm to assess the relative importance of all publications in
the Physical Review family of journals from 1893–2003. While the Google number and the number
of citations for each publication are positively correlated, outliers from this linear relation identify
some exceptional papers or “gems” that are universally familiar to physicists.

INTRODUCTION

tation network.

With the availability of electronically available citation
data, it is now possible to undertake comprehensive stud-
ies of citations that were unimaginable just a few years
ago. In most previous studies of citation statistics, the
metric used to quantify the importance of a paper is its
number of citations. In terms of the underlying citation
network, in which nodes represent publications and di-
rected links represent a citation from a citing article to a
cited article, the number of citations to an article trans-
lates to the in-degree of the corresponding node. The dis-
tribution of in-degree for various citation data sets has a
broad tail [1] that is reasonably approximated by a power
law [2, 3, 4].

While the number of citations is a natural measure of
the impact of a publication, we probably all have encoun-
tered examples where citations do not seem to provide a
full picture of the inﬂuence of a publication. We are thus
motivated to study alternative metrics that might yield a
truer measure of importance than citations alone. Such a
metric already exists in the form of the Google PageRank
algorithm [5]. A variant of the PageRank algorithm was
recently applied to better calibrate the impact factor of
scientiﬁc journals [6].

In this work, we apply Google PageRank to the Phys-
ical Review citation network with the goal of measur-
ing the importance of individual scientiﬁc publications
published in the APS journals. This network consists of
353,268 nodes that represent all articles published in the
Physical Review family of journals from the start of pub-
lication in 1893 until June 2003, and 3,110,839 links that
represent all citations to Physical Review articles from
other Physical Review articles. As found previously [4],
these internal citations represent 1/5 to 1/3 of all cita-
tions for highly-cited papers. This range provides a sense
of the degree of completeness of the Physical Review ci-

With the Google PageRank approach, we ﬁnd a
number of papers with a modest number of citations
that stand out as exceptional according to the Google
PageRank analysis. These exceptional publications, or
gems, are familiar to almost all physicists because of
the very inﬂuential contents of these articles. Thus the
Google PageRank algorithm seems to provide a new and
useful measure of scientiﬁc quality.

II. THE GOOGLE PAGERANK ALGORITHM

To set the stage for our use of Google PageRank to
ﬁnd scientiﬁc gems, let us review the elements of the
PageRank algorithm. Given a network of N nodes i =
1, 2, . . . , N , with directed links that represent references
from an initial (citing) node to a target (cited) node,
the Google number Gi for the ith node is deﬁned by the
recursion formula [5]:

Gi = (1 − d)

Gj
kj

+

d
N

.

Xj nn i

(1)

Here the sum is over the neighboring nodes j in which
a link points to node i. The ﬁrst term describes propa-
gation of the probability distribution of a random walk
in which a walk at node j propagates to node i with
probability 1/kj, where kj is the out-degree of node j.
The second term describes the uniform injection of prob-
ability into the network in which each node receives a
contribution d/N at each step.

Here d is a free parameter that controls the perfor-
mance of the Google PageRank algorithm. The prefactor
(1−d) in the ﬁrst term gives the fraction of random walks
that continue to propagate along the links; a complemen-
tary fraction d is uniformly re-injected into the network,
as embodied by the second term.

We suggest that the Google number Gi of paper i,
deﬁned by Eq. (1), is a better measure of importance
i)
than the number of citations alone in two aspects:
being cited by inﬂuential papers contributes more to the
Google number than being cited by unimportant papers;
ii) being cited by a paper that itself has few references

gives a larger contribution to the Google number than
being cited by a paper with hundreds of references. The
Google number of a paper can be viewed as a measure
of its inﬂuence that is then equally exported to all of
its references. The parameter d > 0 prevents all of the
inﬂuence from concentrating on the oldest papers.

In the original Google PageRank algorithm of Brin and
Page [5], the parameter d was chosen to be 0.15. This
value was prompted by the anecdotal observation that
an individual surﬁng the web will typically follow of the
order of 6 hyperlinks, corresponding to a leakage proba-
bility d = 1/6 ≃ 0.15, before becoming either bored or
frustrated with this line of search and beginning a new
search. In the context of citations, we conjecture that en-
tries in the reference list of a typical paper are collected
following somewhat shorter paths of average length 2,
making the choice d = 0.5 more appropriate for a similar
algorithm applied to the citation network. The empirical
observation justifying this choice is that approximately
50% of the articles [9] in the reference list of a given pa-
per A have at least one citation B → C to another article
C that is also in the reference list of A (Fig. 1). Assum-
ing that such “feed-forward” loops result from authors of
paper A following references of paper B, we estimate the
probability 1 − d to follow this indirect citation path to
be close to 0.5.

C

FIG. 1: Feed-forward citation loop: Publication A cites both
publications B and C. About 50% of entries B in the reference
list of a typical publication A cite at least one other article C
in the same reference list.

To implement the Google PageRank algorithm for the
citation network, we start with a uniform probability
density equal to 1/N at each node of the network and
then iterate Eq. (1). Eventually a steady state set of
Google numbers for each node of the network is reached.
These represent the occupation probabilities at each node
for the random-walk-like process deﬁned by Eq. (1). Fi-
nally, we sort the nodal Google numbers to determine
the Google rank of each node. It is both informative and
entertaining to compare the Google rank with the cita-
tion (in-degree) rank of typical and the most important
publications in Physical Review.

III. GOOGLE PAGERANK FOR PHYSICAL

Fig. 2 shows the average Google number hG(k)i for
publications with k citations as a function of k. For small
k, there are many publications with the same number
of citations and the dispersion in G(k) is small. Corre-
spondingly, the plot of hG(k)i versus k is smooth and

FIG. 3: Individual outlier publications. For each number of
citations k, the publication with the highest Google number
is plotted. The top-10 Google-ranked papers are identiﬁed by
author(s) initials (see Table I). As a guide to the eye, the

in Fig. 2.

increases linearly with k for k & 50. Thus the average
Google number and the number of citations represent
similar measures of popularity, a result that has been ob-
served previously [7, 8]. In fact, the citation and Google
number distributions are qualitatively similar, further in-
dicating that citations and Google numbers are, on the
average, similar measures of importance.

However, for large k, much more interesting behavior
occurs. When k is suﬃciently large, there is typically
only one publication with k citations. Thus instead of an
average value, Fig. 3 shows the individual publications
with the largest Google number for each value of cita-

3

tion number when k ≥ 100. Of particular interest are
the extreme outliers with respect to the linear behavior
of Fig. 2. The ten articles with the highest Google num-
bers are shown explicitly and are identiﬁed by author
initials (see Table I). Also given in Table I is the num-
ber of citations and the citation rank of these publica-
tions. While several of the highest-cited Physical Review
papers appear on this list, there are also several more
modestly-cited papers that are highly ranked according
to the Google algorithm.

The disparity between the the Google rank and cita-
tion rank arises because, as mentioned in the previous
section, the former involves both the in-degree as well
as the Google PageRank of the neighboring nodes. Ac-
cording to the Google algorithm of Eq. (1), a citing pub-
lication (“child”) j contributes a factor hGj /kji to the
Google number of its parent paper i. Thus for a paper
to have a large Google number, its children should be
important (large Gj), and also each child should have a
small number of parents (small out-degree kj ). The lat-
ter ensures that the Google contribution of a child is not
strongly diluted.

With this perspective, let us compare the statistical
measures of the two articles “Unitary Symmetry and
Leptonic Decays”, Phys. Rev. Lett. 10, 531 (1963) by
N. Cabibbo (C) and “Self-Consistent Equations Includ-
ing Exchange and Correlation Eﬀects”, Phys. Rev. 140,
A1133 (1965) by W. Kohn & L. J. Sham (KS). The for-
mer has the highest Google number of all Physical Re-
view publications, while the latter is the most cited. The
high Google rank of C stems from the fact that that
value of hGj /kji = 1.52 × 10−6 for the children of C is an
order of magnitude larger than the corresponding value
hGj/kji = 2.31 × 10−7 for the children of KS. This diﬀer-
ence more than compensates for the factor 5.6 diﬀerence
in the number of citations to these two articles (3227
for KS and 574 for C as of June 2003). Looking a lit-
tle deeper, the diﬀerence in hGj/kji for C and KS stems
from the denominator; the children of C have 15.6 cita-
tions an average, while the children of KS are slightly
“better” and have 18.4 citations on average. However,
the typical child of C has fewer references than a child
of KS and a correspondingly larger contribution to the
Google number of C.

The remaining research articles on the top-10 Google-
rank list but outside the top-10 citation list are easily
recognizable as seminal publications. For example, On-
sager’s 1944 paper presents the exact solution of the two-
dimensional Ising model; both a calculational tour de
force, as well as a central development in the theory of
critical phenomena. The paper by Feynman and Gell-
Mann introduced the V − A theory of weak interactions
that incorporated parity non-conservation and became
the “standard model” of weak interactions. Anderson’s
paper, “Absence of Diﬀusion in Certain Random Lat-
tices” gave birth to the ﬁeld of localization and is cited
by the Nobel prize committee for the 1977 Nobel prize in
physics.

The last entry in the top-10 Google-rank list, “The
Theory of Complex Spectra”, by J. C. Slater (S) is par-

ticularly striking. This article has relatively few citations
(114 as of June 2003) and a relatively low citation rank
(1853th), but its Google number 2.13 × 10−4 is only a
factor 2.2 smaller than that of Cabibbo’s paper! What
accounts for this high Google rank? From the scientiﬁc
standpoint, Slater’s paper introduced the determinant
form for the many-body wavefunction. This form is so
ubiquitous in current literature that very few articles ac-
tually cite the original work when the Slater determinant
is used. The Google PageRank algorithm identiﬁes this
hidden gem primarily because the average Google con-
tribution of the children of S is hGj /kji = 3.51 × 10−6,
which is a factor 2.3 larger than the contribution of the
children of C. That is, the children of Slater’s paper were
both inﬂuential and Slater loomed as a very important
father ﬁgure to his children.

The striking ability of the Google PageRank algorithm
to identify inﬂuential papers can be seen when we con-
sider the top-100 Google-ranked papers. Table II shows
the subset of publications on the top-100 Google rank
in which the ratio of Google rank to citation rank is
greater than 10; that is, publications with anomalously
high Google rank compared to their citation rank. This
list contains many easily-recognizable papers for the av-
erage physicist. For example, the publication by Wigner
and Seitz, “On the Constitution of Metallic Sodium”
introduced Wigner-Seitz cells, a construction that ap-
pears in any solid-state physics text. The paper by Gell-
Mann and Brueckner, “Correlation Energy of an Electron
Gas at High Density” is a seminal publication in many-
body theory. The publication by Glauber, “Photon Cor-
relations”, was recognized for the 2005 Nobel prize in
physics. The Kramers-Wannier article, “Statistics of the
Two-Dimensional Ferromagnet. Part I”, showed that a
phase transition occurs in two dimensions, contradicting
the common belief at the time. The article by Dyson,
“The Radiation Theories of Tomonaga, Schwinger, and
Feynman”, uniﬁed the leading formalisms for quantum
electrodynamics and it is plausible that this publication
would have earned Dyson the Nobel prize if it could have
been shared among four individuals. One can oﬀer sim-
ilar rationalizations for the remaining articles in this ta-
ble.

On the other hand, an apparent mistake is the paper by
Rosenstock and Marquardt, “Cluster formation in two-
dimensional random walks: Application to photolysis of

silver halides” (RM). Notice that this article has only
3 citations! Why does RM appear among the top-100
Google-ranked publications? In RM, a model that is es-
sentially diﬀusion-limited aggregation is introduced. Al-
though these authors had stumbled upon a now-famous
model, they focused on the kinetics of the system and
apparently did not appreciate its wonderful geometrical
features. This discovery was left to one of the children
of RM—the famous paper by T. Witten and L. Sander,
“Diﬀusion-Limited Aggregation, a Kinetic Critical Phe-
nomenon” Phys. Rev. Lett. 47, 1400 (1981), with 680
citations as of June 2003. Furthermore, the Witten and
Sander article has only 10 references; thus a substantial
fraction of its fame is exported to RM by the Google
PageRank algorithm. The appearance of RM on the list
of top-100 Google-ranked papers occurs precisely because
of the mechanics of the Google PageRank algorithm in
which being one of the few references of a famous paper
makes a huge contribution to the Google number.

A natural question to ask is whether the Google rank-
ings are robust with respect to the value of the free pa-
rameter d in the Google algorithm. As mentioned above,
we believe that our ad hoc choice of d = 0.5 accounts in
a reasonable way for the manner in which citations are
actually made. For d = 0.15, as in the original Google
algorithm, the Google rankings of highly-cited papers lo-
cally reorder to a considerable extent compared to the
rankings for the case d = 0.5, but there is little global
reordering. For example, all of the top 10 Google-ranked
papers calculated with d = 0.5 remained among the top-

50 Google-ranked papers for d = 0.15. Thus up to this
degree of variation, Google rankings are a robust mea-
sure.

On the other hand, in the limit d → 1 Google rank
approaches citation rank. For example, for d = 0.9, 7
of the top-10 Google-ranked papers with d = 0.9 are
also among the 10 most-cited particles, while the citation
ranks of the remaining 3 of the top-10 Google-ranked
articles are 19, 54, and 56. In fact, we argue that the
Google rank reduces to citation rank as d → 1. To show
this, we ﬁrst notice that in the extreme case of d = 1, the
Google number of each node equals 1/N . For d → 1, we
therefore write d = 1 − ǫ, with ǫ ≪ 1, and also assume
that there is a correspondingly small deviation of the
Google numbers from 1/N . Thus we write Gi = 1
N +
O(ǫ). Substituting these into Eq. (1), we obtain

To estimate the sum in Eq. (2), we use the fact that
the out-degree distribution is relatively narrow (Fig. 4),
especially if we exclude the broad tail that is caused by
the contributions of review articles that appear in the
Reviews of Modern Physics. While the mean in-degree
and out-degrees are both close to 9 (and should be exactly
equal for the complete citation network), the dispersion
for the in degree is 23.15, while the dispersion for the out
degree (excluding Reviews of Modern Physics) is 8.64.

As a result of the sharpness of the out-degree distribu-

That is, the leading correction to the limiting d = 1 result
that Gi = 1
N is proportional to the in-degree of each
node. Thus as d → 1, the Google rank of each node
is identical to its citation rank under the approximation
that we neglect the eﬀect of the dispersion of the out-
degree in the citation network.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We believe that protocols based on the Google
PageRank algorithm hold a great promise for quantify-
ing the impact of scientiﬁc publications. They provide
a meaningful extension to traditionally-used importance
measures, such as the number of citation of individual ar-
ticles and the impact factor for journals as a whole. The
PageRank algorithm implements, in an extremely simple
way, the reasonable notion that citations from more im-
portant publications should contribute more to the rank
of the cited paper than those from less important ones.
Other ways of attributing a quality for a citation would
require much more detailed contextual information about
the citation itself.

The situation in citation networks is not that dissim-
ilar from that in the World Wide Web, where hyper-
links contained in popular websites and pointing to your
webpage would bring more Internet traﬃc to you and
thus would contribute substantially to the popularity of
your own webpage. Scientists commonly discover rele-
vant publications by simply following chains of citation
links from other papers. Thus it is reasonable to assume
that the popularity or “citability” of papers may be well
approximated by the random surfer model that underlies
the PageRank algorithm. One meaningful diﬀerence be-
tween the WWW and citation networks is that citation
links cannot be updated after publication, while WWW
hyperlinks keep evolving together with the webpage con-
taining them. Thus scientiﬁc papers and their citations
tend to age much more rapidly than active webpages.
These diﬀerences could be taking into account by explic-
itly incorporating the eﬀects of aging into the Page Rank
algorithm [10].

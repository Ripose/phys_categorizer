Abstract. We present the timing and spectral properties of the transient Be/X-

ray binary pulsar 3A 0535+262 during quiescence using three observations with

the narrow ﬁeld imaging instruments (NFI) of BeppoSAX. Assuming a distance

of 2 kpc for this system, the 2–10 keV X-ray luminosities measured from the three
−1, indicating a very low rate
observations are in the range of 1.5–4.0 × 1033 erg s

of accretion. We report the detection of pulsations at a very low luminosity of
2 × 1033 erg s−1 during one of the three observations, though at this accretion

rate the system is expected to be in the centrifugally inhibited regime. The X-

ray spectra for the unpulsed observations are best modeled as power law type

while a combined model of power law and black-body is required to ﬁt the pulsed

spectrum.

1. Introduction

3A 0535+262 is a close binary system which contains a O9.7 IIIe Be star (HDE 245770,

Giangrande et al. 1980) and a slowly rotating, strongly magnetized neutron star. The

X-ray source was discovered by the Ariel V satellite (Rosenberg et al. 1975) when it was

in a ‘giant outburst’ mode with X-ray intensity of the order of ∼ 2 Crab in the 3–7 keV

range and showed pulsations at 104 s. The system has been observed to undergo several

transient X-ray outbursts classiﬁed as “giant” (2–10 keV ﬂux > 1 crab) and “normal”

(2–10 keV ﬂux < 1 crab) outbursts. After 1975 two more giant outbursts were observed,

one in 1980 detected with the Hakucho satellite (Nagase et al. 1982) and another one

in 1994 by the BATSE detectors onboard CGRO (Finger et al. 1996). A large orbital

2

U. Mukherjee and B. Paul: 3A 0535+262

period of 111.0±0.4 days was discovered from the long term light curves obtained with

the Vela 5B satellite (Priedhorsky and Terrell 1983). Interestingly, the system shows

signiﬁcant periodic optical variability at a diﬀerent period of ∼ 103 days (Larionov,

Lyuty & Zaitseva 2001). During the 1994 outburst, quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO)

were observed with frequency correlated to the X-ray ﬂux and spin-up torque (Finger et

al. 1996, Ghosh 1996). The orbital parameters were also determined from observations

made with BATSE during this outburst. The magnetic ﬁeld strength of the neutron star
in 3A 0535+262 is ∼ 1 × 1013 Gauss as measured from the cyclotron resonance scattering

feature with the OSSE experiment onboard CGRO during the 1994 outburst (Grove et

al. 1995).

With EXOSAT observations made in 1985-1986 in between the outbursts, a moderate

and pulsating X-ray ﬂux was detected from 3A 0535+262 at various orbital phases (Motch

et al. 1991). The X-ray ﬂux in the 1–20 keV energy band was measured to be in the range
of 1.5–3.0 × 10−10 erg cm2 s−1, which corresponds to a luminosity of 0.7–1.4 ×1035 erg
s−1 for a distance of 2 kpc (Steele et al. 1998). The detection of X-ray pulsations in

two of the EXOSAT observations showed that the mass accretion rate was large enough

not to cause centrifugal inhibition and that material from the outﬂow of the Be star

companion accretes through a disk onto the neutron star. In more recent observations

of 3A 0535+262 made with the Proportional Counter Array of the Rossi X-ray Timing

Explorer (RXTE-PCA), the source was detected at a much lower luminosity of 2.0–4.5
× 1033 erg s−1 at which the onset of centrifugal inhibition of accretion or propeller eﬀect

is expected. The X-ray luminosity that was still detected in the propeller regime was

ascribed to material leaking through the magnetosphere or thermal emission from the

heated core of the neutron star (Negueruela et al. 2000). However, as the RXTE-PCA

detectors are non-imaging instruments and therefore have large internal and X-ray sky

background, the ﬂux and spectral measurements at low intensity are not very accurate.

In this paper, we present X-ray timing and spectral properties of 3A 0535+262 in a

quiescent state from three observations made with the Beppo-SAX narrow ﬁeld imag-

ing spectrometer instruments. Detection of pulsations and measurement of the X-ray

spectrum in quiescent state may resolve the outstanding issue regarding the diﬀerent ac-

cretion regimes in which the system would reside. In the subsequent sections we describe

the observations (§2), results from timing and spectral analysis (§3) and a discussion on

the propeller eﬀect in this pulsar and the X-ray spectral properties in the pulsating and

non-pulsating states (§4) based on the results obtained here.

2. Observations

Three observations of 3A 0535+262 were made with the Beppo-SAX observatory on 2000

September 4 (5:14 UT), October 5 (00:42 UT) and 2001 March 5 (22:52 UT) (observa-

tions A, B and C hereafter). The scientiﬁc payload of Beppo-SAX consists of four Narrow

Field Instruments (NFI) comprising one unit of Low Energy Concentrator Spectrometer
(LECS; 0.1–10 keV, 22 cm2 @ 0.28 keV) and three Medium Energy Concentrator
Spectrometer (MECS; 1.3–10 keV, 150 cm2 @ 6 keV). The energy resolution (% FWHM)
of the LECS and the MECS detectors is 8 × (E/6 keV)−0.5. BeppoSAX also consists of

a High Pressure Gas Scintillator Proportional Counter along-with a Phoswich Detection

System. A detailed description of Beppo-SAX can be found in Boella et al. (1997). Taking

the time of periastron passage and the orbital period from Finger et. al. (1996), the or-

bital phases of the three observations A, B and C are 0.77, 0.05 and 0.42 respectively.

The respective observations are shown in Figure 1 along-with a sketch of the orbit of

3A 0535+262/HDE 245770 binary system. The useful on-source times for the three ob-

servations were 32 ks, 39 ks and 51 ks each for the MECS and 19 ks, 30 ks and 43 ks for

the LECS detectors. As the source 3A 0535+262 was very faint during these observations,

we have analyzed data only from the narrow ﬁeld imaging instruments. Data from only

two of the MECS detectors were available and the event ﬁles of the two detectors were

added before further analysis.

3. Data Analysis

3.1. Timing Analysis

We extracted the MECS light curves with a time resolution of 1.0 s and then corrected

the arrival times to the times at the solar system barycentre. The average count rate of
the light curves of A & B were ∼ 0.04 count s−1 while that of C was 0.09 count s−1. All

the three light curves showed intensity variations by more than a factor of two at a few

hours to day timescale. The light curve of C had a stretch of 240 ks spread over several

satellite orbits, which is useful for accurate measurement of pulse period. We searched

for pulsations in the light curves of all the three observations using the pulse folding
and χ2 maximization technique in the expected pulse period range of 102–104 s with a

period resolution of 0.0035 s. Only the observation C showed coherent pulsations with

a period of 103.41 s and the result of the period search is shown in Figure 2. Another

period of 101.57 s also showed up when the period search was performed over a wider

range between 101–105 s. But by looking at the long term pulse period history of this

pulsar (Figure 3), it may be inferred that a period of 101.57 s is quite unlikely and arose

here due to the window function of the light curve.

To determine the lowest intensity in observation C at which pulsations can be detected

from 3A 0535+26, we subsequently divided the total MECS observation duration into

twenty four roughly equal segments in time. Following this we extracted ﬁve separate

light-curves each containing data only from those segments with average count rate less
than 0.15 count s−1, 0.125 count s−1, 0.1 count s−1, 0.08 count s−1, and 0.06 count s−1

4

U. Mukherjee and B. Paul: 3A 0535+262

respectively. From independent pulsation searches on these light curves with the same

parameter space as mentioned above, we detected pulsations down to an average count
rate of less than 0.08 count s−1. The inset in Figure 2 shows the period search result of

the light-curve created from the segments with average count rate less than 0.08 count
s−1. The light curve with segment-wise average count rate of less than 0.06 count s−1

has a very small time duration and pulsations could not be detected independently from

it. However, if this light curve is folded with the same pulse period as determined from

the entire observation, the pulse proﬁle clearly shows intensity variations correlated with

the pulse proﬁles from the higher intensity segments (Figure 4). The pulse proﬁles are

background subtracted and the pulse fraction is [(Maximum - Minimum)/Maximum] ∼

50%. Thus it is fair to conclude that pulsations exist in 3A 0535+262 during observation
C down to at least a count rate of 0.06 count s−1. Measurement of the X-ray luminosity

of 3A 0535+262 corresponding to this count rate is presented in the next section.

3.2. Spectral Analysis

The source and background spectra were extracted from the MECS and LECS detec-
tors using circular regions of radius 4′ and 8′ respectively. The energy range chosen for

MECS was 1.8–10.5 keV while that for LECS was 0.3–4.5 keV, in which the respective

instruments have large eﬀective area and the spectral responses are well understood. For

all the three observations, the MECS and LECS phase averaged spectra were ﬁtted si-

multaneously with the relative normalization of the two instruments allowed to vary. All
the spectra were suitably binned to allow use of χ2 statistics.

The continuum spectra of accreting X-ray pulsars are most often described by a power

law with a high energy cut-oﬀ, with the cut-oﬀ energy usually above 10 keV. Therefore,

while ﬁtting a pulsar spectra in medium energy band that is not very wide, only a power

law or a black-body model is invoked. Orlandini and Dal Fiume (2001) noted that the

continuum of accreting X-ray pulsars as observed by BeppoSAX can be well described in

terms of a black-body component, a power law and a high energy cutoﬀ (Ec > 10 keV).

The main physical process responsible for the continuum emission in accreting X-ray

pulsars is Compton up-scattering of soft seed photons. Depending on the value of the

comptonization parameter(y), the emergent spectrum of the photons can be a black-body

type (y ≪ 1) or power law type with a high energy cut-oﬀ (if y ≫ 1 and the inverse

compton scattering is unsaturated). Motivated by these factors, we ﬁtted the spectra

in XSPEC v11.2.0 (Shafer, Haberl and Arnaud 1989) with power law and black-body

models along-with an absorption by material in the line of sight. The black-body model
does not ﬁt any one of the three spectra well and reduced χ2 of more than 2.0 were

obtained. The results from the power law spectral ﬁt are given in Table 1 along with 90%

conﬁdence limits for the spectral parameters. We found that the spectra from the ﬁrst two

U. Mukherjee and B. Paul: 3A 0535+262

5

observations (A & B) ﬁt very well with the model while the spectrum from observation

C during which the X-ray luminosity was higher, does not ﬁt. Hence we tried to put

in another additive component. A power law and a black-body component along with

absorption column density was found to ﬁt the spectrum of observation C well and the

spectral parameters are given in Table 2. The power law photon index (for a single power

law component for observations A & B and a double component model for observation C)

during these three observations is between 1.5–2.0, whereas the temperature of the black-

body component is 1.33 keV. Assuming a 2 kpc distance for the object, the radius of the

emission region for this black-body model is estimated to be ∼ 0.1 km. The absorption
column density, for all the three observations is about 6.5 × 1021 atoms cm−2, marginally
above the galactic column density towards 3A 0535+262 which is 5.9 × 1021 atoms cm−2.
The 2–10 keV luminosities (in unit of 1033 erg s−1) for observations A, B & C are 1.54,

1.62 and 4.07 respectively for power law type spectra and 3.93 for the two component

spectrum in observation C. The spectrum from observation C is shown in Figure 5, along

with the model components and the residual to the best ﬁt model.

The LECS and MECS spectra were extracted for the time intervals in observation
C during which the average count rate was less than 0.06 count s−1 (see the previous

section). These spectra were ﬁtted simultaneously with the power law plus black-body

model with the absorption column density, power law photon index, black-body tem-

perature, and the relative LECS/MECS normalization being kept ﬁxed to the values

determined from the entire observation. Thus the lowest luminosity at which pulsations
could be detected from 3A 0535+262 came out to be 2.0 × 1033 erg s−1 calculated for a

distance of 2 kpc.

4. Discussion

Transient X-ray pulsars in general are prone to wide variations in mass accretion rates

and are suitable systems to test the various accretion regimes onto high magnetic ﬁeld
neutron stars. They generally have luminosities of the order of 1032–1033 erg s−1 during

quiescence. Detection of pulsations in these sources with such a low luminosity seems

to be an interesting phenomenon regarding the classiﬁcation of the accretion regimes in

which these systems may exist.

The luminosities obtained by us, 1.5–4.0 × 1033 erg s−1, during the three quiescence

observations with BeppoSAX are similar to that of Negueruela et al. (2000) measured

with the RXTE-PCA in quiescence. But the EXOSAT observations of this source during

previous low states (Motch et al. 1991) report a luminosity two orders of magnitude higher

than what is observed in quiescence. During observation C, we show that pulsations exist
for a luminosity as low as 2.0 × 1033 erg s−1, similar to the lowest luminosity obtained

for this source in quiescence by Negueruela et al. (2000). However, as the RXTE-PCA

6

U. Mukherjee and B. Paul: 3A 0535+262

detectors are non-imaging instruments, the diﬀuse X-ray emission from the galactic ridge

can cause hindrance to an accurate measurement of the very low X-ray ﬂux and the

spectral properties of 3A 0535+262 in quiescence.

Assuming an eﬃciency η = 1 in the conversion of gravitational energy into X-ray
luminosity, the luminosity obtained by us in the whole of observation C (  L= 3.95 × 1033
erg s−1 ) gives an accretion rate ˙M = 2.05 × 1013 g s−1. For the known surface magnetic

ﬁeld strength and the spin period of this pulsar, we obtain the magnetospheric radius as

rm = 9.35 × 10

9 cm

rc = 3.0 × 109

cm

and the corotation radius is calculated to be

(1)

(2)

Therefore as rm > rc, following Stella et al. (1986), the pulsar in observation C as well

as in A & B can be expected to be in the centrifugally inhibited regime. In this regime,

accretion onto the neutron star surface is inhibited by the centrifugal action of the rotat-

ing magnetosphere (Illarionov and Sunyaev 1975). As observations A & B do not show

pulsations, we infer that at such a low level of luminosity they are indeed in the centrifu-

gally inhibited regime. During observation C, which has the highest luminosity among

the three, though rm > rc would mean the existence of a centrifugal barrier, pulsations

have been detected unambiguously. The detection of pulsations in C probably means

that a fraction of the disk material is somehow going onto the surface of the neutron star

along the magnetic ﬁeld lines. The three BeppoSAX NFI observations combined together
show that at a luminosity between 1.5–4.0 × 1033 erg s−1, 3A 0535+262 makes a tran-

sition between centrifugal inhibition and direct accretion onto the neutron star surface.

We would like to note here that there are some uncertainties regarding the calculation of

rm. If η is not equal to 1 or if the distance to the source is very diﬀerent from what has

been assumed; the value of rm would change. A very low η would correspond to higher

accretion rate which in turn compresses the magnetosphere to give a smaller value of rm.

But even with η ∼ 0.1 the value of rm does not come out to be less than rc. Similarly,

a larger distance would imply a larger X-ray luminosity and higher accretion rate. The

distance of 2 kpc to 3A 0535+262 has been determined using spectral type and reddening

of its companion star (Steele et al. 1998) and is unlikely to be wrong by a large factor.

Another uncertainty in the calculation of rm is due to the assumption of aligned rotator.

Other X-ray transients like 4U 0115+63 (Campana et al. 2001 with BeppoSAX) and

GRO J1744-28 (Wijnands et al. 2002 with Chandra) in quiescence with luminosities of
∼ 1033 erg s−1 have also been thought to be in the centrifugally inhibited regime.

We found that the phase averaged spectrum for observation C ﬁtted well when a

combined model of power law and black-body along with absorption was used. Else in

the spectra of the other two observations A & B, the power law index (Γ) was between 1.5–
2.0 and the equivalent hydrogen column density obtained was of the order of 1021 atoms

U. Mukherjee and B. Paul: 3A 0535+262

7

cm−2. The spectral parameters of Motch et al. (1991) are in conformity with ours as they
obtained photon index ∼ 1.66 while the column density was ∼ 1021 atoms cm−2. The low

column density measured for this source matches with the amount of material expected

in the line of sight from reddening. The visual extinction Av ∼ 2.7 mag (Giangrande
et al. 1980) gives a column density of ∼ (4.8–6.0) × 1021 atoms cm−2 (Predehl and

Schmitt 1995, Gorenstein 1975). On the other hand, Negueruela et al. (2000) obtained

values of the column density which are an order of magnitude higher than that obtained

here with the BeppoSAX spectrometers. Since the energy range for RXTE-PCA was

taken to be 3–20 keV, the measurements of column density by Negueruela et al. (2000)

cannot be compared with the values obtained here with combined BeppoSAX MECS-

LECS which goes down to 0.3 keV. As the low energy part of the spectrum is measured

quite well with BeppoSAX, it can also be used to have some gross understanding about

the wind density and the mass-loss rate of the companion star. After taking into account
the galactic column density towards this source (5.9 × 1021 atoms cm−2) it is evident
that the column density arising due to local material is very low; of the order of 1020
atoms cm−2. A very low column density would imply a very low mass-loss rate for the

companion star which can cause the low mass accretion rate as observed here. To have an

order of magnitude estimation of the parameters, we have calculated the column density

proﬁle with orbital phase for the pulsar by considering a spherically symmetric stellar

wind emanating from the companion and assuming a terminal wind velocity of ∼ 1000
km s−1 and the inclination to the orbit was taken to be 25◦ (Okazaki and Negueruela

2001). Assuming spherical accretion, a set of three curves were obtained, each for the

observations A, B & C with the mass-loss rates being calculated from their respective

luminosities. The eﬀective column density values (Observed column density – Galactic

column density) as obtained from the power law ﬁts were superimposed on this set of

curves as shown in Figure 6. The eﬀective values of the column density are of the same

order of magnitude as of the model. Thus it can be said that a low luminosity and low

value of the measured local absorption column density are consistent with a low mass

loss rate from the companion star.

It is to be noted that the spectra for the pulsating and the non-pulsating states are

diﬀerent. From the three BeppoSAX observations, it is clear that a power law spectral

model ﬁts the quiescence spectra much better than a black-body model, although an

additional black-body component helps in improving the ﬁt signiﬁcantly for observation

C. From RXTE-PCA spectrum (Negueruela et al. 2000) it was not possible to distinguish

between power law and black-body models. The radii of the emitting region for the black-

body component in the third spectrum came out to be almost two orders of magnitude

smaller compared to the canonical 10 km neutron star radius. It is plausible that at very

low accretion rates as is the case here, the plasma not having enough ram pressure to

compress the magnetosphere moves along the outermost ﬁeld lines and gets deposited on

8

U. Mukherjee and B. Paul: 3A 0535+262

the very inner parts of the polar caps and hence occupy a rather small and compact region.

In this scenario, the black-body component in the spectra of observation C with very low

emitting region may be possible. In this regard, we mention the RXTE observations of

the persistent low luminosity X-ray pulsar 4U 0352+309 (Coburn et al. 2001). The area
of the black-body component (∼ 108 cm2; same as obtained in obs. C) seen in its spectra

in low state was consistent with being emitted from the magnetic polar cap of the pulsar.

This black-body component in observation C is quite diﬀerent from the soft excess

usually observed in some binary X-ray pulsars (Yokogawa et al. 2000, Paul et al. 2002).

They are in general modeled as a black-body or thermal bremsstrahlung where the black-
body temperature is ∼ 0.1 keV and the area of the emitting region ∼ 1015−16 cm2.

Recently, Hickox, Narayan and Kallman (2004) have explored the physical origin of this
so called “soft excess” and found that for sources with luminosity Lx ≤ 1036 erg s−1, it

may be due to emission by photoionized or collisionally heated diﬀuse gas, or thermal
emission from the surface of the neutron star. In the highly luminous (Lx ≥ 1038 erg s−1)

sources, the soft component may be due to reprocessing of hard X-rays by the optically

thick, accreting material, most likely near the inner edge of the accretion disk. At low

luminosities, like in the present case, the inner disk temperature can not be high enough

for it to be an X-ray emitter. Moreover, the size of the black-body emission region in

3A 0535+262 is very small compared to that of the inner accretion disk, and the ﬂux in

the black-body component is a substantial fraction of that in the power law component

(∼50% in the present case). These facts suggest that the black-body component is not

reprocessed by hard X-ray emission as is the case in many luminous High Mass X-ray

Binary (HMXB) pulsars. Rather, this soft black-body component resembles that of 4U

0352+309 (Coburn et al. 2001). In another HMXB, 4U 1700–37, a previously known soft

X-ray excess (Haberl et al. 1994) has now been found to consist of a blend of low energy

emission lines (Boroson et al. 2003). However, in the cases of 3A 0535+262 (present

work) and 4U 0352+309 (Coburn et al. 2001), the temperature of the soft component is

an order of magnitude higher and is unlikely to be a blend of narrow emission lines.

5. Conclusions

We have investigated the timing and spectral properties of the X-ray pulsar 3A 0535+262

in quiescent state using the narrow ﬁeld instruments of the BeppoSAX observatory. We

have detected pulsations in observation C in parts of which the 2–10 keV X-ray luminosity
was as low as 2 × 1033 erg s−1. For all the three observations of 3A 0535+262 the accretion

is expected to be centrifugally inhibited though the detection of pulsations at these low

ﬂux levels in one of them indicates that some matter may have leaked through onto the

neutron star surface. When the emission is non-pulsating, the X-ray spectrum is power

law type. The origin of an additional black-body component in the pulsed observation is

not very clear though it seems to be essential in ﬁtting the spectra.

Fig. 1. Orbital geometry of 3A 0535+262/HDE 245770 binary system. The orbital phases

are marked on the circumference of the ellipse. The observations A, B and C are denoted

with asterisks and the projection of the line of sight on the orbital plane is also shown.

The orbital parameters are taken from Finger et al. (1996). The radius of the companion
star is 15 R⊙ and the inclination of the orbit is ∼ 25◦ (Okazaki and Negueruela 2001)

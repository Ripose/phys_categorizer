Abstract

We derive an equation of motion for interest-rate yield curves by applying a min-
imum Fisher information variational approach to the implied probability density.
By construction, solutions to the equation of motion recover observed bond prices.
More signiﬁcantly, the form of the resulting equation explains the success of the Nel-
son Siegel approach to ﬁtting static yield curves and the empirically observed modal
structure of yield curves. A practical numerical implementation of this equation of
motion is found by using the Karhunen-L`oeve expansion and Galerkin’s method to
formulate a reduced-order model of yield curve dynamics.

Key words: Bond, interest rate, dynamics, Fisher information, yield curve, term
structure, principal-component analysis, proper orthogonal decomposition,

Yield curves are remarkable in that the ﬂuctuations of these structures can
be explained largely by a few modes and that the shape of these modes is
largely independent of the market of origin: a combination of parsimony and
explanatory power rarely seen in ﬁnancial economics. While these modes play
a fundamental role in ﬁxed-income analysis and risk management, both the
origin of this modal structure and the relationship between this modal struc-
ture and a formal description of yield curve dynamics remain unclear. The
purpose of this letter is to show that this modal structure is a natural conse-
quence of the information structure of the yield curve and that this information
structure, in turn, implies an equation of motion for yield curve dynamics.

Our application of Fisher information to yield curve dynamics is an exten-
sion of prior work [1,2,3] using this approach to derive equations of motion in
physics and static probability densities in asset pricing theory 2 . Though less
well known as a measure of information in physics and mathematical ﬁnance
than Shannon entropy, the concept of Fisher information predates Shannon’s
and other information statistics, and remains central to the ﬁeld of statisti-
cal measurement theory [6]. Fundamentally, it provides a representation of
the amount of information in the results of experimental measurements of an
unknown parameter of a stochastic system. Fisher information appears most
famously in the Cramer-Rao inequality that deﬁnes the lower bound on vari-
ance/upper bound on eﬃciency of a parameter estimate given a parameter
dependent stochastic process. It also provides the basis for a comprehensive
alternative approach to the derivation of probability laws in physics and other
sciences [1,2,7].

In the present work, the aim of our approach is to derive a diﬀerential equa-
tion for yield curve dynamics, ab initio, with the minimal imposition of prior
assumption, save that bond price observations exist, and that a stochastic
process underlies the dynamics. In a sense our approach is an inversion of
the perspective of a maximum likelihood estimate, where one would solve
for the most likely parameter values given observations within the context
of a pre-assumed model. Here we apply “minimum presumption” by deriving
the stochastic model that is implied by minimizing Fisher information given
known parameter measurements (bond prices).

A yield curve is a representation of the rate of interest paid by a ﬁxed-income
investment, such as a bond, as a function of the length of time of that invest-
ment. The interest rate over a given time interval, between say today and a
point of time in the future, determines the value at the beginning of the time
interval of a cash ﬂow to be paid at the end of the interval; also known as the
present value of the cash ﬂow. Since the value of any security is the present
value of all future cash ﬂows, yield curve ﬂuctuations give rise to ﬂuctuations
in present value and, thus, play an important role in the variance of security
prices.

The notion that a modal structure underlies yield curve dynamics comes from
common empirical experience with two related yield-curve measurements -
the construction of static yield curves from observed market prices and the
analysis of correlations between corresponding points in the time evolution of
successive static yield curves. Yield curves are inferred from observed ﬁxed-
income security prices and as the prices of these securities change over time so

imum entropy [4] and minimum local cross entropy [5] in the context of ﬁnancial
economics is discussed in [3].

does the yield curve. Yield curves are usually generated after the close of each
trading session and this process can therefore be viewed as a stroboscopic mea-
surement of the yield curve. Yield curves can assume a variety of shapes and
many methods have been proposed for their construction 3 . Of these meth-
ods, the Nelson Siegel approach [9] of representing yield curves as solutions of
diﬀerential equations has gained wide acceptance in the ﬁnance industry [10]
and in academic research on yield-curve structure [11,12,13,14,15]. In using
a second-order diﬀerential equation to represent the yield curve the Nelson
Siegel approach is essentially a proposal that yield curves can be represented
eﬀectively by a modal expansion and the practical success of this approach to
yield curve ﬁtting in markets around the world is a measure of the correctness
of this assertion.

The modal structure of the yield curve is also implied in the eigenstructure
of the two-point correlation function constructed from yield curves. Specif-
ically, diagonalization of the covariance matrix of yield changes along the
yield curve produces an eigenstructure where most of the variance - as mea-
sured by summing the normalized eigenvalues - is explained by the ﬁrst few
eigenmodes [16,17,18]. The consistency of the general shape of the eigen-
modes derived from empirical yield curve data and the explanatory power
of the truncated expansions in those eigenmodes is surprisingly robust over
time and largely independent of the country in which the interest rates are
set [19,20,21]. While this analysis motivated the use of yield-curve modes by
ﬁxed-income strategists and risk managers some time ago, an explicit link
between yield-curve modes and dynamics appeared in comparatively recently
research demonstrating the eigenstructure to be consistent with both the ex-
istence of a line tension along the yield curve and a diﬀusion-like equation
of motion for yield curves [22]. This notion of a line tension along the yield
curve has found further expression in descriptions of the yield curve as a vi-
brating string [23]. While the yield curve phenomenology just described can
be described well by modal expansions there as been little to motivate why
this should be the case and it is to this question that we now turn.

We begin with a more formal description of the notion of present value men-
tioned above. The yield curve is closely related to the function D(t, T ) known
as the discount function that gives the value at time t (i.e. the present value)
of a unit of currency (e.g. dollar) to be paid at time T in the future

−
D(t, T ) = e−rs(t,T )(T −t) = e

where rs(t, T ) is the “spot rate” yield curve at time t, specifying the con-
tinuously compounded interest rate for borrowing over the period [t, T ], and

rf (t, T ) is known as the “forward rate” yield curve at time t, specifying the
interest rate for instantaneous borrowing over [T, T + δT ].

Our explanation for the existence of dynamic yield-curve modes builds on
our recent application of Fisher information methods [2,3] to the construction
of well-mannered, static yield curves from a ﬁnite set of discount functions
or observed bond prices. Our approach, based on deriving yield curves that
extremize Fisher information, is facilitated by associating such yield curves
with complementary probability density functions where the time to maturity
T is taken to be an abstract random variable [24,25]. We assume the associated
probability density p(t, T ) satisﬁes p(t, T ) > 0 and is related to the discount
factor D(t, T ) via

D(t, T ) =

p(t, s)ds .

Discount factors are, however, not always observable. Coupon bonds, on the
other hand, are commonly available with prices B(t, N) related to the discount
factor by

B(t, N) =

C (Ti) D (t, Ti) ,

∞

ZT

N

Xi=1

where N indicates the number of remaining coupon payments and C (Ti) is
the cash ﬂow at time Ti in the future. For a typical coupon bond C (Ti) is
equal to the ith coupon payment for i < N and equal to the ﬁnal coupon
payment plus the principal payment for i = N.

In these expressions one can see that discount factors and bond prices share a
common structure as averages of known functions. Discount factors are the av-
erage of Θ (s − T ) and coupon bond prices are the average of
where Θ(x) is the Heaviside step function. Generally, where observed data
d1, . . . , dM = {dm} such as discount factors and the prices of bonds can be
expressed as averages of known functions {fm} at a static point in time, we
may write

and the probability density function p(T ) implicit in the observed data can be
obtained by forming a Lagrangian using Fisher information [26] in its shift-

where the λ’s are Lagrange multipliers that enter by incorporating a nor-
malization constraint on p(T ) (λ0) and observed data (λm) into the Fisher
information Lagrangian.

This is equivalent to an approximate use of the extreme physical information
(EPI) approach [1,2,7] wherein the constraint equations (Eq. 4) are used in
place of the fundamental source information J required by EPI. This replace-
ment amounts to a technical (as compared with fundamental) approach to
valuation.

In a recent communication [3] we exploited the formal equivalence of Eq. 7
and the time-independent Schroedinger wave equation (SWE) to calculate the
equilibrium densities p(T ) implicit in security prices as shown in Fig. 1. In the
graphs on the left-hand side of Fig. 1 we see the results for a single discount
factor with a price of 35% of par and a tenor of 10 years. The upper-left
graph illustrates the elements of Eq. 2 with the potential term of the SWE

(
well described by the step function, λ1, the level of λ0 and the probability
P
density function (PDF) p(T ), all follow from a self-consistent ﬁeld calculation
with the {λ0, p(T )} pair corresponding to the ground state of Eq. 7 subject to
the constraint given by Eq. 2. The lower-left graph shows the spot and forward
yield curves that follow from the PDF in the upper graph as deﬁned by Eq. 1.

The results of this analysis for a 6.75% coupon bond making semi-annual
payments with a maturity date of November 15, 2006, a price of 77.055% of
par, and a pricing date of October 31, 1994 [27] are shown on the right-hand
side of Fig. 1. The stepped structure of the potential function is a result of the
cumulative sum of the coupon payments with the ﬁnal large step being due to
the principal payment. Unlike the discount factor, there is no analytic solution
to Eq. 7 for the coupon bond. This type of potential is, however, ideally suited
to the transfer matrix method of solution [28] and that is the approach we used
to calculate the PDF solution shown in the upper-right graph. The calculation
of a general yield curve from a collection of coupon bonds is a straightforward
extension of this approach.

The general solution to the SWE with potentials of this form is commonly
expressed as a series expansion of modes and these modes have been used
to go beyond the equilibrium solutions illustrated in Fig. 1 to describe non-
equilibrium phenomena in physics [29,30,31]. It is with these modes that the
modal structure of the yield curve follows directly from the Fisher information
structure of the yield curve (cf. Eq. 8 below). This result also provides an
information-theoretic derivation of the Nelson Siegel approach. Of interest as
well is the behavior of the solutions illustrated in Fig. 1 in the range of tenor
where there are no observed security prices. The solution to Eq. 7 is known
to be an exponential decay which leads to a constant interest rate: a result
consistent with most priors concerning long-term interest rates.

The temporal evolution of yield curves now follows directly from the known
relationship between solutions of Eq. 7 and those of the Fokker -Planck equa-
tion 4 [33,34]. Speciﬁcally, the solutions of Eq. 7 {λ(m)
, qm(T )} can be used to
construct a general solution [33]

where the potential function U(T ) is related to the ground state q0(T ) via

Taken together, Eqs. 7 through 10 explain the existence of a modal structure
of yield curves and provide a theoretical basis for the common ansatz that a
diﬀusion process underlies interest-rate dynamics [8,18,35,36].

There are a variety of ways to solve Eq. 8, but the observation that the the
eigenstructure of the two-point correlation function is dominated by a few
modes suggests that this inﬁnite series can be reduced to a few terms us-
ing the Karhunen-L`oeve expansion 5 together with the Galerkin approxima-
tion [37,38,39,40]. Speciﬁcally, writing Eq. 8 in the slightly more general form

m=0 am(t)φm(T ) where φm(T ) ≡ q0(T )qm(T ), substituting this into

Truncating the series expansion for p(T, t) at i = N gives a Galerkin approx-
imation of order N [39] and this truncation is justiﬁed in our case because of
the dominance to the two-point correlation function by a few modes.

An example of applying this approach to the dynamics of the Eurodollar yield
curve is illustrated in Fig. 2. The probability density function implicit in the
Eurodollar futures market from the beginning of 1994 to the end of 1996 is
shown in the upper-left panel of the ﬁgure and the average of these density
functions is shown in the lower-left panel 6 . Using the method of snapshots [37]
we obtained the eigenstructure shown partially in the two right-hand panels of
Fig. 2. As the normalized eigenvalues indicate, more than 99% of the variance

5 This approach appears under a variety of names including factor analysis,
principal-component analysis, and proper orthogonal decomposition.

of this system is contained in the ﬁrst two modes. Thus a Galerkin approxi-
mation of order 2 would be expected to provide an adequate representation of
yield curve dynamics.

In summary, we have derived an equation of motion for yield curves that is
consistent with observed statics and dynamics starting from the Fisher infor-
mation of the probability density function that underlies the discount func-
tion. Our derivation leads to a Schroedinger wave equation for the probability
amplitude of the density function underlying the discount factor and thus
explains why solutions of equations of mathematical physics involving second-
order tenor derivatives work so well as a representation of yield curves. This
result also provides an explanation for the existence of a line-tension term in
the equations of motion found in string models of yield curves. Using the well-
known relationship between solutions of the Schroedinger wave equation and
the Fokker-Planck equation we obtained an equation of motion for the yield
curve consistent with the common ansatz that diﬀusion processes underly
yield-curve dynamics. Since the eigenstructure of the yield-curve two-point
correlation function is dominated by a few modes we found that a practi-
cal numerical solution to this equation of motion can be had by using the
Karhunen-L`oeve expansion together with Galerkin’s method.

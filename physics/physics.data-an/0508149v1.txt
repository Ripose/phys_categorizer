We use the multifractal detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (MF-DFA), to study the sunspot number ﬂuctuations.
We show that sunspot time series has a crossover time scale (s×), where the signal has different correlation
exponents in time scales s > s× and s < s×. Comparing the MF-DFA results of the original time series to
those for shufﬂed and surrogate series, we conclude that its multifractality nature is almost due to long-range
correlations.

scales s× separating regimes with different scaling exponents
[5,6]. In this case investigation of the scaling behavior is more
complicate and different scaling exponents are required for
different parts of the series [7]. Therefore one needs a multi-
tude of scaling exponents (multifractality) for a full descrip-
tion of the scaling behavior.

I. INTRODUCTION

Sunspots are observed as moderate-dark formations on the
sun surface. A sunspot is a relatively cool area on the solar
surface that appears as a dark blemish [1]. The number of
sunspots is continuously changing in time in a random fash-
ion and constitutes a typically random time series. Because
of the symmetry of the twisted magnetic lines as the origin
of sunspots, they are generally seen in pairs or in groups of
pairs at both sides of the solar equator. As the sunspot cy-
cle progresses, spots appear closer to the sun’s equator giving
rise to the so called “butterﬂy diagram” in the time latitude
distribution. Figure 1 shows the monthly measured number of
sunspots in terms of time. This plot includes 3077 data points.
The data belongs to a data set collected by the Sunspot Index
Data Center (SIDC) from 1749 up to now [2].

In recent years the detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA)
method has become a widely-used technique for the determi-
nation of (mono-) fractal scaling properties and the detection
of long-range correlations in noisy, nonstationary time series
[3–7]. It has successfully been applied to diverse ﬁelds such
as DNA sequences [3,8], heart rate dynamics [9,10], neuron
spiking [11], human gait [12], long-time weather records [13],
cloud structure [14], geology [15], ethnology [16], economi-
cal time series [17], and solid state physics [18]. One reason
to employ the DFA method is to avoid spurious detection of
correlations that are artefacts of nonstationarity in time series.
The focus of the present paper is on the intriguing statistical
properties and multifractal nature of the sunspot time series.
In general, two different types of multifractality in time se-
ries can be distinguished: (i) Multifractality due to a fatness
of probability density function (PDF) of the time series. In
this case the multifractality cannot be removed by shufﬂing
the series. (ii) Multifractality due to different long-range cor-
relations in small and large scale ﬂuctuations. In this case the
data may have a PDF with ﬁnite moments, e. g. a Gaussian
distribution. Thus the corresponding shufﬂed time series will
exhibit mono-fractal scaling, since all long-range correlations
are destroyed by the shufﬂing procedure. If both kinds of mul-
tifractality are present, the shufﬂed series will show weaker
multifractality than the original series.

In some cases, there exist one or more crossover (time)

This paper is organized as follows: In Section II we de-
scribe the MF-DFA method in detail and show that the scaling
exponents determined via the MF-DFA method are identical
to those obtained by the standard multifractal formalism based
on partition functions. The MF-DFA results of sunspot time
series and crossover time scale are presented in Section III. In
Section IV, we show that the long-range correlation is domi-
nant by comparing the MF-DFA results for original series to
those obtained via the MF-DFA for shufﬂed and surrogate se-
ries. Section V closes with a discussion of the present results.

II. MULTIFRACTAL DETRENDED FLUCTUATION
ANALYSIS

The simplest type of the multifractal analysis is based upon
the standard partition function multifractal formalism, which
has been developed for the multifractal characterization of
normalized, stationary measurements [19–22]. Unfortunately,
this standard formalism does not give correct results for non-
stationary time series that are affected by trends or that cannot
be normalized. Thus, in the early 1990s an improved multi-
fractal formalism has been developed, the wavelet transform
modulus maxima (WTMM) method [23], which is based on
the wavelet analysis and involves tracing the maxima lines in
the continuous wavelet transform over all scales. Here, we
apply an alternative approach based on a generalization of the
DFA method for the analysis of sunspot time series. This mul-
tifractal DFA (MF-DFA) does not require the modulus max-
ima procedure, and hence does not require more effort in pro-
gramming and computing than the conventional DFA.

A. Description of the MF-DFA

The generalized multifractal DFA (MF-DFA) procedure
consists of ﬁve steps. The ﬁrst three steps are essentially iden-
tical to the conventional DFA procedure (see e. g. [3–7]). Sup-
pose that xk is a series of length N , and that this series is of
compact support, i.e. xk = 0 for an insigniﬁcant fraction of
the values only.
• Step 1: Determine the “proﬁle”

i

Xk=1

Y (i) ≡

[xk − hxi] ,

i = 1, . . . , N.

(1)

Subtraction of the mean hxi is not compulsory, since it would
be eliminated by the later detrending in the third step.
• Step 2: Divide the proﬁle Y (i) into Ns ≡ int(N/s) non-
overlapping segments of equal lengths s. Since the length N
of the series is often not a multiple of the considered time
scale s, a short part at the end of the proﬁle may remain. In
order not to disregard this part of the series, the same proce-
dure is repeated starting from the opposite end. Thereby, 2Ns
segments are obtained altogether.
• Step 3: Calculate the local trend for each of the 2Ns seg-
ments by a least-square ﬁt of the series. Then determine the
variance

F 2(s, ν) ≡

{Y [(ν − 1)s + i] − yν(i)}2

called DFA1, DFA2, DFA3, . . .) [3,10]. Since the detrending
of the time series is done by the subtraction of the polynomial
ﬁts from the proﬁle, different order DFA differ in their capa-
bility of eliminating trends in the series. In (MF-)DFAm [mth
order (MF-)DFA] trends of order m in the proﬁle (or, equiv-
alently, of order m − 1 in the original series) are eliminated.
Thus a comparison of the results for different orders of DFA
allows one to estimate the type of the polynomial trend in the
time series [5,6].
• Step 4: Average over all segments to obtain the q-th order
ﬂuctuation function, deﬁned as:

(cid:3)

(cid:2)
where, in general, the index variable q can take any real value
except zero. For q = 2, the standard DFA procedure is re-
trieved. Generally we are interested in how the generalized
q dependent ﬂuctuation functions Fq(s) depend on the time
scale s for different values of q. Hence, we must repeat steps
2, 3 and 4 for several time scales s. It is apparent that Fq(s)
will increase with increasing s. Of course, Fq(s) depends on
the DFA order m. By construction, Fq(s) is only deﬁned for
s ≥ m + 2.
• Step 5: Determine the scaling behavior of the ﬂuctuation
functions by analyzing log-log plots of Fq(s) versus s for each
value of q. If the series xi are long-range power-law corre-
lated, Fq(s) increases, for large values of s, as a power-law,

Fq(s) ∼ sh(q).

(5)

In general, the exponent h(q) may depend on q. For station-
ary time series, 0 < h(2) < 1.0, where h(2) is identical to
the well-known Hurst exponent H (see e. g. [19]). In the non-
stationary case the corresponding scaling exponent of Fq(s)
is identiﬁed by ¯α(q) > 1.0. It is converted into the Hurst ex-
ponent according to H = ¯α(q = 2) − 1. Thus, one can call
the function h(q) the generalized Hurst exponent.

For monofractal time series, h(q) is independent of q, since
the scaling behavior of the variances F 2(s, ν) is identical for
all segments ν, and the averaging procedure in Eq. (4) will
just give this identical scaling behavior for all values of q. If
we consider positive values of q, the segments ν with large
variance F 2
s (ν) (i. e. large deviations from the corresponding
ﬁt) will dominate the average Fq(s). Thus, for positive values
of q, h(q) describes the scaling behavior of the segments with
large ﬂuctuations. For negative values of q, the segments ν
with small variance F 2
s (ν) will dominate the average Fq(s).
Hence, for negative values of q, h(q) describes the scaling
behavior of the segments with small ﬂuctuations [24].

B. Relation to standard multifractal analysis

for ν = Ns +1, . . . , 2Ns. Here, yν(i) is the ﬁtting polynomial
in segment ν. Linear, quadratic, cubic, or higher order poly-
nomials can be used in the ﬁtting procedure (conventionally

For a stationary, normalized series the multifractal scal-
ing exponents h(q) deﬁned in Eq. (5) are directly related to
the scaling exponents τ (q) deﬁned by the standard partition

that are used instead of τ (q) in some papers. While h(q) is
independent of q for a monofractal time series, D(q) depends
on q in this case. Another way to characterize a multifractal
series is the singularity spectrum f (α), that is related to τ (q)
via a Legendre transform [19,21],

α = τ ′(q) and f (α) = qα − τ (q).

(13)

Here, α is the singularity strength or H¨older exponent, while
f (α) denotes the dimension of the subset of the series that is
characterized by α. Using Eq. (11), we can directly relate α
and f (α) to h(q),

α = h(q) + qh′(q)

and f (α) = q[α − h(q)] + 1.

(14)

A H¨older exponent denotes monofractality, while in the
multifractal case, the different parts of the structure are char-
acterized by different values of α, leading to the existence of
the spectrum f (α).

III. ANALYSIS OF SUNSPOT TIME SERIES

As mentioned in section II, generalized Hurst exponents
h(q) in Eq. (5) can be found by analyzing log-log plots of
Fq(s) versus s for each q. Our investigation shows that there
is at least one crossover time scale s× in the log-log plots of
Fq(s) versus s for every q’s, for a monthly time axis. Figure 2
shows that there are different scaling exponent for time scales
s > s× and s < s×. To ensure the existence of the crossover
time scale, we plot the log-log graph of Fq(s) versus s for
q = −1.0, q = 2.0 and q = 3.0 in ﬁgure 3. This proves that
existence of the crossover time scale do not depend on the spe-
cial values of q. The crossover time scale is about s× ∼ 130
which is equal to the well known cycle of approximately 11
years of sun activity.

Let us now apply MF-DFA1 method for two different time
scales i.e. s < 130 and s > 130. Figure 4 shows the
MF-DFA1 results for time scale s > 130. The signal is
almost monofractal which means that h(q) dose not vary sig-
niﬁcantly with q. The weak q-dependence of h(q) is shown
in Figure 4, but q- dependence of the classical multifractal
scaling exponent τ (q) has different behaviors for q < 0 and
q > 0. For positive and negative values of q, the slopes of
τ (q) are 0.55 ± 0.001 and 0.33 ± 0.001, respectively. Accord-
ing to the relation between the Hurst exponent and h(2), i.e.
h(q = 2) = H, we ﬁnd that the Hurst exponent is 0.62±0.04.
This means that the sunspot time series in time scales s > s×
is a stationary process with long-range correlation [25].

function-based multifractal formalism as shown below. Sup-
pose that the series xk of length N is a stationary, normalized
sequence. Then the detrending procedure in step 3 of the MF-
DFA method is not required, since no trend has to be elimi-
nated. Thus, the DFA can be replaced by the standard Fluc-
tuation Analysis (FA), which is identical to the DFA except
for a simpliﬁed deﬁnition of the variance for each segment ν,
ν = 1, . . . , Ns. Step 3 now becomes [see Eq. (2)]:

F 2
FA(s, ν) ≡ [Y (νs) − Y ((ν − 1)s)]2.

(6)

Inserting this simpliﬁed deﬁnition into Eq. (4) and using
Eq. (5), we obtain

|Y (νs) − Y ((ν − 1)s)|q

∼ sh(q).

For simplicity we can assume that the length N of the series
is an integer multiple of the scale s, obtaining Ns = N/s and
therefore

|Y (νs) − Y ((ν − 1)s)|q ∼ sqh(q)−1.

This corresponds to the multifractal formalism used e. g. in
[20,22]. In fact, a hierarchy of exponents Hq similar to our
h(q) has been introduced based on Eq. (8) in [20]. In order
to relate also to the standard textbook box counting formalism
[19,21], we employ the deﬁnition of the proﬁle in Eq. (1). It
is evident that the term Y (νs) − Y ((ν − 1)s) in Eq. (8) is
identical to the sum of the numbers xk within each segment ν
of size s. This sum is known as the box probability ps(ν) in
the standard multifractal formalism for normalized series xk,

ps(ν) ≡

xk = Y (νs) − Y ((ν − 1)s).

The scaling exponent τ (q) is usually deﬁned via the partition
function Zq(s),

Zq(s) ≡

|ps(ν)|q ∼ sτ (q),

(10)

where q is a real parameter as in the MF-DFA method, dis-
cussed above. Using Eq. (9) we see that Eq. (10) is identical
to Eq. (8), and obtain analytically the relation between the two
sets of multifractal scaling exponents,

τ (q) = qh(q) − 1.

(11)

Thus, we observe that h(q) deﬁned in Eq. (5) for the MF-DFA
is directly related to the classical multifractal scaling expo-
nents τ (q). Note that h(q) is different from the generalized
multifractal dimensions

The auto-correlation function can be characterized by a
power law C(s) ≡ hnknk+si ∼ s−γ with exponent γ = 2 −
2H. Its power spectra can be characterized by S(ω) ∼ ω−β
with frequency ω and β = 2H − 1. The singularity spectrum
f (α), Eq. (13) is shown in Figure 4. All the related quantities
are given in Table I and Table II.

The MF-DFA1 results for monthly sunspot time series for
time scales s < 130 are shown in Figure 5. Sunspot time
series in this regime is a multifractal process as indicated by
the strong q dependence of generalized Hurst exponent and
τ (q). The upper and lower slopes of τ (q) as a function of q
are 0.13 ± 0.001 and 1.56 ± 0.001, respectively. The gen-

4

eralized Hurst exponent is ¯α(q = 2) = 1.59 ± 0.03, and
indicates that this process for the time scales s < 130 is a
nonstationary process with long-range correlation behavior.
The auto-correlation function and power spectra exponents
are γ = −2H and β = 2H +1, respectively [26,27]. The frac-
tal dimension in this regime is obtained as Df = 2−H = 1.44
[5]. The values of derived quantities from MF-DFA1 method,
are given in Table III and Table IV.

IV. COMPARISON OF THE MULTIFRACTALITY FOR
ORIGINAL, SHUFFLED AND SURROGATE SUNSPOT
TIME SERIES

As mentioned in the introduction, two different types of

cases is required a multitude of scaling exponents for small
and large ﬂuctuations. In this section we interested in the na-
ture of the multifractal behavior of sunspot time series. The
origin of multifractality of a time series can be due to the
broadness ( fatness ) of probability density function (PDF) of
sunspot time series or due to the different long-range correla-
tions of the number ﬂuctuations. Here we would like to distin-
guish between these two types of multifractality. The easiest
way to clarify this question is to analysis the corresponding
shufﬂed and surrogate series. The shufﬂing of time series de-
stroys the long range correlation, Therefore if the multifractal-
ity only belongs to the long range correlation, we should ﬁnd
hshuf (q) = 0.5. The multifractality nature due to the fatness
of the PDF signals is not affected by the shufﬂing procedure.
In the surrogate method, the phase of discrete fourier trans-
form (DFT) coefﬁcients of sunspot time series are replaced
with a set of pseudo independent distributed uniform (−π, π)
quantities. The correlations in the surrogate series do not
change, but the probability function changes to the Gaussian
distribution. If multifractality in the time series is due to a
broad PDF, h(q) obtained by the surrogate method will be in-

in sunspot time series, the shufﬂed and surrogate series will
show weaker multifractality than the original one.

To check the nature of multifractality, we compare the ﬂuc-
tuation function Fq(s), for the original series with the result
of the corresponding shufﬂed, F shuf
(s) and surrogate series
q
F sur
(s). Differences between these two ﬂuctuation functions
q
with the original one, directly indicate the presence of long
range correlations or broadness of probability density func-
tion in the original series. These differences can be observed
in a plot of the ratio Fq(s)/F shuf
(s) ver-
q
sus s [25]. Since the anomalous scaling due to a broad prob-
ability density affects Fq(s) and F shuf
(s) in the same way,
only multifractality due to correlations will be observed in
Fq(s)/F shuf

(s). The scaling behavior of these ratios are

If only fatness of the PDF is responsible for the multifrac-
tality, one should ﬁnd h(q) = hshuf (q) and hcor(q) = 0.
On the other hand, deviations from hcor(q) = 0 indicates
the presence of correlations, and q dependence of hcor(q)
indicates that multifractality is due to the long rage correla-
tion. If only correlation multifractality is present, one ﬁnds
hshuf (q) = 0.5. If both distribution and correlation multifrac-
tality are present, both, hshuf (q) and hsur(q) will depend on
q.

The q dependence of the exponent h(q) for original, sur-

Also the exponent hcor and hP DF vs q for time scales s > s×
and s < s× are illustrated in Figures 8 and 9, respectively.
The q dependence of hcor and hP DF shows that the multifrac-
tality nature of sunspot time series is due to both broadness of
the PDF and long range correlation. In both cases the absolute
value of hcor(q) is greater than hP DF (q), so the multifractal-
ity due to the fatness is weaker than the mulifractality due to
the correlation. The deviation of hcor(q) and hP DF (q) from
h(q) can be determined by using χ2

ν test as follows:

χ2

ν⋄ =

1
N − m

[h(q) − h⋄(q)]2
σ(q)2 + σ⋄(q)2 ,

(17)

N

i=1
X

where N −m is the degree of freedom and the symbol ⋄ can be
replaced by cor and P DF to determine the conﬁdence level
of hshu and hsur to generalized Hurst exponents of original
series, respectively. The value of χ2
ν⋄ for shufﬂed and surro-
gate time series in the s > s× and s < s× regimes are 3.41,
1.33 and 569.00, 102.38, respectively. In Figure 10 we com-
pare the dependence of F (s) to the scale s for the original,
surrogate and shufﬂed sunspot time series. As we mentioned
above the effect of shufﬂed series on the MF-DFA1 results is
greater than surrogate series.
The crossover time scale in correlation behavior in the shuf-
ﬂed series is destroyed, however this time scale exists in the
surrogate series.

V. CONCLUSION

Acknowledgements
We would like to thank Sepehr Arbabi Bidgoli for reading

The MF-DFA method allows us to determine the multifrac-
tal characterization of the nonstationary and stationary time
series. We have shown that the monthly sunspot time series
has a crossover time scale (s×). This crossover time scale is
equal to the well known cycle of sun activity, approximately
11 years(132 months). Applying the MF-DFA1 method shows
that the monthly sunspot time series is an effectively station-
ary time series for time scales s > s× and a nonstationary pro-
cess for s < s×. The weak q dependence of h(q) and τ (q),
for the s > s× shows that the monthly sunspot time series
has an almost monofractal behavior. Otherwise for s < s×,
the strong q dependence of h(q) and τ (q), indicates that the
sunspot number ﬂuctuation is a multifractal. By comparing
the generalized Hurst exponent of the original time series with
the shufﬂed and surrogate one’s, we have found that multi-
fractality due to the correlation has more contribution than the
broadness of the probability density function. We have esti-
mated also the Hurst exponent in small and large time scales
via the modiﬁed MF-DFA method. Usually, in the MF-DFA
method, deviation from a straight line in the log-log plot of
Eq. (5) occurs for small scales s. This deviation limits the
capability of DFA to determine the correct correlation behav-
ior for very short scales and in the regime of small s. The
modiﬁed MF-DFA is deﬁned as follows [5]:

where h[F shuf
(s)]2i1/2 denotes the usual MF-DFA ﬂuctuation
function [deﬁned in Eq. (4)] averaged over several conﬁgura-
tions of shufﬂed data taken from the original time series, and
s′ ≈ N/40. The values of the Hurst exponent obtained by
MF-DFA1 and modiﬁed MF-DFA1 methods are given in Ta-
ble V. The relative deviation of the Hurst exponent which is
obtained by modiﬁed MF-DFA1 in comparison to MF-DFA1
in the s < s× regime, is approximately 7.14% for original
sunspot time series.

[24] For the maximum scale s = N the ﬂuctuation function Fq(s)
is independent of q, since the sum in Eq. (4) runs over only two
identical segments (Ns ≡ [N/s] = 1). For smaller scales s ≪
N the averaging procedure runs over several segments, and the
average value Fq(s) will be dominated by the F 2(s, ν) from
the segments with small (large) ﬂuctuations if q < 0 (q > 0).
Thus, for s ≪ N , Fq(s) with q < 0 will be smaller than Fq(s)
with q > 0, while both become equal for s = N . Hence, if we
assume an homogeneous scaling behavior of Fq(s) following
Eq. (5), the slope h(q) in a log-log plot of Fq(s) with q < 0
versus s must be larger than the corresponding slope for Fq(s)
with q > 0. Thus, h(q) for q < 0 will usually be larger than
h(q) for q > 0.

Abstract

A formula of Doetsch (Math. Zeitschr. 42, 263 (1937)) is generalized and

used to numerically invert the one-sided Laplace transform ˆC(β). The neces-

sary input is only the values of ˆC(β) on the positive real axis. The method is

applicable provided that the functions ˆC(β) belong to the function space L2
α

deﬁned by the condition that G(x) = exα ˆC(ex), α > 0 has to be square inte-

grable. This space includes sums of exponential decays ˆC(β) =

∞
n ane−βEn,

e.g. partition functions with an = 1.

P

In practice, the inversion algorithm consists of two subsequent fast Fourier

transforms. High accuracy inverted data can be obtained, provided that the

signal is also highly accurate. The method is demonstrated for a harmonic

partition function and resonant transmission through a barrier. We ﬁnd ac-

curately inverted functions even in the presence of noise.

I. INTRODUCTION

It is often relatively easy to compute the Laplace transform

of a function rather than the function itself. Similarly, it is often known how to compute a

function on the imaginary axis and it is desirable to have a useful method for analytic con-

tinuation of the function to real time. Perhaps the most notable example is the computation

of the propagator < x
|
which is straightforward in imaginary time t =

e−itH/¯h

x′ > which is very diﬃcult because of the sign problem but

i¯hβ. A ’good’ Laplace inversion method-

ology would solve both of these issues. The diﬃculty is that the inverse Laplace transform

is known to be an ill-posed problem, since the addition of a small perturbation (for example

(β

1

−

−

ib)−1) to the image ˆC(β) leads to a non-vanishing contribution (i.e. exp

(1 + ib)E

)

{

}

even in the limit of a very small perturbation (large b) [1].

Diﬀerent numerical methods have been worked out to attempt at overcoming this prob-

lem [2], [3]. They divide roughly into ﬁve classes: The Fourier methods [4] which discretize

the Bromwich inversion formula [5]

(E) =

C

1
2π Z

σ+i∞

σ−i∞

eβE ˆC(β)dβ.

(1.2)

This requires knowledge of the function in the complex plane and so does not really solve

the problem.

The next two classes are based on the idea that the original function

(E) may be

C

expanded into a basis set of functions whose transforms are known. To this category belong

the linear least-squares ﬁtting methods, where diﬀerent basis sets are used, e.g. orthogonal

polynomials [1,6], sums of exponentials [7,8], rational fractions or continued fractions [9],

as well as others [10]. Nonlinear least-square ﬁts are necessary if the signal is decomposed

directly into a sum of exponentials with unknown decay rates En and coeﬃcients an [11,12].

With both methods, it is diﬃcult to treat signals accurately which are of the form ˆC(β) =

2

∞
n=1 ane−Enβ. The Laplace transform of a polynomial-type basis possesses singularities and

P
is inadequate for a ﬁt to exponentials. On the other hand, an exponential with a non-integer

decay-rate cannot correctly be approximated by exponentials of the sort e−nβ. As a result of

these diﬃculties, these methods are able to give at most ﬁve exponentials. For other signals,

such as rational polynomials, they have proved to be very accurate.

Another approach is the singular value decomposition method (SVD) [13,14] which is

based on the theory of inverse problems. This method transfers the inverse Laplace transform

into a matrix equation and the problem is transformed into the inversion of a nearly singular

matrix, an ill-posed problem as well [15].

The ﬁfth and most recent approach is the maximum entropy method [3,16].

In this

method the entropy of the spectrum (which means in this context the number of ways of re-

producing the spectrum) subject to a certain constraint is maximized. This approach allows

to incorporate prior knowledge about the solution. Maximum entropy inversion is a nonlin-

ear method, this complicates the practical application. However, it has proved its usefulness

in recent computations, see for example Refs. [17–19]. The last two methods, maximum

entropy and SVD, have recently been compared in simulating the electronic absorption

spectrum of a chromophore coupled to a condensed phase environment and it turned out

that the maximum entropy method is just able to reproduce the classical, smooth Franck-

Condon contribution to the spectrum whereas SVD is capable of resolving ﬁner oscillatory

details [20].

In this paper we will resurrect an old formula, derived by Paley and Wiener [21] and

by Doetsch [22], which is direct, there is no need to use a basis set and there is no need to

solve a set of nonlinear equations. The Paley and Wiener form was rederived by Gardner

et al. [23] 40 years ago and applied with limited success (due in part to computational

limitations) to the analysis of multi-exponential decay curves. The old formulae were derived

for functions ˆC(β) which are L2 integrable and so are not directly useful, for example for

partition functions. We will generalize them, so that the method includes all functions which

are L2

α integrable, that is that the function G(x) = exα ˆC(ex), α > 0 is L2 integrable. We

3

ﬁnd for an exponential series that the quality of the inversion depends on the magnitude of

the n-th exponent En. The smaller En, the more accurate the inversion. This enables to

enhance the resolution of the inverted data.

In Section II, we derive the generalized Laplace inversion formula, numerical properties

of the formula are discussed in Section III. The eﬀect of shifting the signal is studied in

Section IV. Applications to the harmonic oscillator partition function and a model resonant

transmission probability are given in Section V. We end with a discussion of the merits of

the method and outline some future extensions and applications.

II. THE CONTINUOUS SET

−1
α OF INVERSE LAPLACE TRANSFORMS

L

In this Section we derive and generalize a Laplace inversion formula which uses only the

values of the Laplace transformed function ˆC(β) on the positive, real β axis. The starting

point is the one-sided Laplace integral Eq. (1.1) for which we perform a transformation of

variables

E = eξ

β = ex .

(2.1)

The motivation for this transformation, which goes back to Doetsch in 1936 [24], is to

substitute the Laplace kernel e−βE in which we have the product of the two variables by a

diﬀerent one which contains the sum of the two variables. As a result, the Laplace integral

takes the form of a convolution.

If on both sides of the Laplace integral transform the

Fourier transform is applied, a certain convolution theorem can be used in order to express

the right hand side of the integral equation as a product of two terms. Finally, an algebraic

manipulation leads to the desired inversion formula.

If we follow this route both sides of Eq. (1.1) are multiplied with an exponential exα

with α > 0 so that:

Now, the integrand on the right hand side consists of one part which depends only on the

linear combination x + ξ and a second, braced part which depends only on ξ. Next, both

sides of the equation are Fourier transformed (with respect to x) and an application of the

convolution theorem (which is equivalent to replacing the variable x by z = x + ξ) gives

(2.10)

We have to require that exα ˆC(ex) is square integrable, lest we encounter divergent inte-

grals. This is not a very stringent requirement, as we can vary the parameter α to assure

convergence. For example, the partition function of the harmonic oscillator

Z(β) =

1
2 sinh β/2

(2.11)

leads to an L2 integrable function provided that α > 1.

Historically, Eq. 2.10 was ﬁrst derived for α = 1 by Paley and Wiener [21] and then

more rigorously by Doetsch [22] for the special case α = 1/2. In its form with α = 1 it

was applied 40 years ago to the analysis of multicomponent exponential decay curves [23].

With the choice α > 1 the inversion formula is now amenable to a wider class of functions.

Not less important is the fact that a proper choice of this exponent improves the numerical

performance of the integrations by an order of magnitude as discussed in Appendix A.

A generalization leading to the multi-dimensional inverse Laplace transform is straight-

forward, as the main steps in the derivation of formula Eq. (2.10) are based on the Fourier

integral. The scalar variables E, β are replaced by N-dimensional vectors E, β to arrive at

the N-dimensional inversion formula:

where the components of E are (eξ1, ..., eξN ) and β = (ex1, ..., exN ). The components of α

may be chosen to be diﬀerent for each degree of freedom.

III. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS

In any numerical application two central questions arise:

a) How does the accuracy with which ˆC(β) is known, or which is reduced due to noise, aﬀect

the accuracy of the inversion technique?

b) What is the range of β for which it is necessary to know the Laplace transformed function

ˆC(β) in order to obtain a ’good’ representation of the function

(E)?

C

6

To answer the ﬁrst question we will consider in some detail the properties of the inversion

formula for a single exponential ˆC(β) = e−E0β. The original signal then is

(E) = δ(E

E0),

−

C

where δ(x) is the Dirac ′δ′-function. The function g(y), cf. Eq. 2.7, can be obtained

analytically:

g(y) = E−α−iy

0

Γ(α + iy) .

(3.1)

(3.2)

This is a rapidly decaying function in the variable y, since the asymptotic behavior of the

Gamma-function for ﬁxed α and large

is:

y

|

|

Γ(α + iy)

√2π

y

α−1/2e−π|y|/2 .

|

| →

|

|

The asymptotic behavior of g(y) remains the same, even if the signal is a sum of many

exponential terms.

As seen from the exact integration Eq. (3.1), the Gamma-function in the denominator of

the inversion formula Eq. (2.10) is cancelled and the y-dependence is simply an oscillating

function with constant amplitude. This means that the numerically integrated function g(y)

has to be exponentially small in y in order to compensate for the exponentially increasing

factor coming from the denominator. The integrand of g(y) as shown in Fig. 1, has an

envelope of order unity and due to the term eixy, it oscillates with increasing frequency as

y increases. In the numerical integration, it is necessary to add up many Simpson boxes of

height of the order of unity which leads to an exponentially small number e−πy/2. The boxes

have diﬀerent signs, so for large y this leads to the severe problem of adding many numbers

with alternating signs, which diﬀer only by a small amount. At this step we encounter the

fact that the inverse Laplace transform is an ill-posed problem: a small error in the signal

ˆC(β) =< ˆC(β) > +δ ˆC(β)

(3.3)

leads to a large error in the integration

< g(y) > +δg(y) =

K(x, y)(< ˆC(β) > +δ ˆC(β)) .

(3.4)

Let m denote the number of decimal digits of the signal and assume that the numerical

integrations are all carried out with this same accuracy. Then g(y) can be obtained only up

to a certain maximum value

ymax ≈

beyond which any result is meaningless. This implies that the y-integration has to be

truncated at ymax. For the single exponent, this leads to the result:

which is a function peaked at E = E0 with many side oscillations. An increase of the

precision m allows to extend ymax resulting in a narrower peak. In the limit ymax → ∞
exact delta function is recovered.

the

To appreciate this result it is instructive to compare it with an analogous analysis of the

Fourier transform of a δ-function. In this case, truncation of the inverse Fourier transform

leads to the approximation:

and for the inverse Fourier transform

△F E =

.

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

Whereas for the Fourier integral the width is independent of the position of the approximate

delta, this is not true for the inverse Laplace transform. The resolution is automatically

higher for lower energy. This means that for a given accuracy m the resolution will increase

the lower the energy is.

8

Now, we come to the second task, the required range of β.

The integrand of g(y) is localized in x: for large negative x, the exponential factor eαx

causes the integrand to decay, while for positive x, the exponentially decaying signal itself

will also cause the integrand to decay rapidly. The decay for positive x is dependent on the

magnitude of the lowest exponent E0. If all calculations are performed with a precision of

m digits, the value of the function is meaningful only up to the value βmax deﬁned as:

e−E0βmax = 10−m ; βmax =

ln 10

(3.10)

m
E0

Since the function g(y) is strongly decaying, the sampling theorem [26] assures that

the integrand needs to be sampled only at relatively few points. Therefore, the numerical

integration involved in obtaining the function g(y) is straightforward. For example, for

ˆC(β) = e−β, α = 1/2, the integrand is larger than 10−15 in a range of

x = 75.0. Using

△

a Simpson integration rule with step size h = 0.1 leads to an integration error of

for y

[0, 20]. That is, we have taken only 750 sampling points for this highly accurate

integration, although the integrand varies quite rapidly for y = 20.0 with a period of

10−16

∼

△px =

0.3141.

In summary, the range of β values needed as well as the resolution with which the inverse

transform is performed is determined by the accuracy with which the Laplace transformed

function ˆC(β) can be obtained. The lower the energy of the features, the larger the β range

needed but also the higher the resolution. This property will be taken advantage of in the

next section to signiﬁcantly improve the algorithm.

IV. SHIFTING THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM.

Consider the case where the function

(E) is a sum of δ functions:

where the Ej’s are arranged according to ascending order. The Laplace transformed function

The inverse Laplace transform will lead to the function,

(E, Es) =

(Ej −

Es)] ,

∞

Xj=0

where all the eigenenergies have been moved closer to the origin by the amount Es. As

shown in the previous section, such a shift will lead to enhanced resolution in the inverted

function.

For illustration, let us consider four exponentials with decay rates 1,2,3,4.

In Fig. 2

we plot the inverse transform with a cutoﬀ at ymax = 5.0, which means that the accuracy

of the signal is only 3 decimal digits. Even the lowest decay rate can hardly be estimated

accurately as may be inferred more clearly from a blow-up of the dashed line shown in Fig.

3. The width of the lowest δ-function is of the same order as the spacing and so it is hardly

discernible. Shifting the function by Es = 0.9 gives a dramatic increase in resolution. A

blow-up of this ﬁrst peak is provided in Fig. 4. From this ﬁgure we can ﬁnd that the

maximum lies at E = 0.0995. The price to be paid for the increased resolution is that βmax

(cf. Eq. 3.10) must be increased, since it is inversely proportional to the magnitude of the

lowest eigenvalue which has now been reduced from E0 to E0 −
computation, shifting the data by 0.999 instead of 0.9 and the peak will be resolved with

Es. One may now repeat the

even higher accuracy. In this way, the eigenvalue can be obtained with arbitrary accuracy.

V. NUMERICAL APPLICATIONS

A. Partition function of the harmonic oscillator

The exact inversion of the partition function Eq. (2.11) leads to a train of delta functions

at the positions of the eigenvalues of the harmonic oscillator. This function was chosen

10

because its numerical Laplace inversion belongs to the most diﬃcult class of problems. A

non-linear least-squares method (without any knowledge in advance) could ﬁt at most ﬁve

exponentials. On the other hand, expansions in diﬀerent basis sets converge too slowly

[2]. The inverse Laplace transform of the partition function was computed with diﬀerent

degrees of decimal digits precision. Fig. 5 compares calculations with double precision,

i.e. 15 decimal digits, and a little higher accuracy, 26 decimal digits. Whereas for double

precision only the two lowest eigenvalues can be identiﬁed, at the higher accuracy the four

lowest eigenvalues are resolved.

The results of pushing the accuracy to 60 and 105 decimal digits precision are shown

in Fig. 6. At 105 decimal digit precision it is possible to identify the eigenvalues up to

the 10th level. The range of β values used in all these computations is as in Eq. (3.10),

4.5m. Of course, these calculations cannot be applied to data obtained from a Monte

βmax ≈
Carlo computation. However, as also discussed in the next section, they may be used to

invert basis sets which can then be ﬁtted to Monte Carlo data. These results also serve to

demonstrate the relative simplicity and accuracy of the method and the fact that in principle

it will work for any number of peaks.

To test the noise-sensitivity of the inverse Laplace transform, we added to the signal a

Gaussian distributed noise with zero mean and diﬀerent levels of RMS deviation σ. The

signal is assumed to be given up to x = 5.52, i.e. βmax = 250. Fig. 7 shows that beyond the

cut-oﬀ value ymax there is an accumulation of numerical errors and the signal deviates from

a cosine-like wave. This Figure also conﬁrms that the cut-oﬀ value depends rather linearly

on the logarithm of the RMS deviation of the noise σ. In Fig. 8, the signal is shifted to

the left by Es = 0.4, so that the smallest decay rate is around E

0.1. The cut-oﬀ values

≈

change only slightly under the shift operation, but the integrand contains more oscillations

before the cut-oﬀ, leading to an enhanced resolution in the peaks.

11

B. Reﬂection probabilities

The Laplace transform of the reﬂection probability for the Eckart potential [28],

1 + cosh(√4α2

π2)

−

,

cosh(2α

E/V ‡) + cosh(√4α2

q

(5.1)

see Fig. 9, is computed by numerical integration. Then the real inversion formula Eq. (2.10)

is used to regain the reﬂection probability. The diﬀerence between the exact function and

the inverted one for the parameter choice α = 4.0, V ‡ = 5.0 is too small to be seen by the

naked eye. A blow-up of the error is shown in Fig. 10. Even for the rather low accuracy

of only 3 decimal digits the relative error is about 10−2, and as seen from the Figure, it

decreases with increasing precision of the data. For the parameter α = 12.0, V ‡ = 5.0 the

results are a bit worse, as shown in Fig. 11, due to the ‘Gibb’s phenomenon‘ [29]. Near the

step, E

5.0 the error increases signiﬁcantly.

≈

In all the computations the cut-oﬀ ymax was chosen to minimize the error: decreasing the

value of ymax reduces the resolution but increasing it leads to numerically wrong values due to

the uncertainty of the signal. In Fig. 12 we show a typical integrand Re

if the inverse Laplace transform is not known, it is easy to judge which value for ymax has

to be chosen, as the integrand decays smoothly and then produces artiﬁcial oscillations and

blows up. (For an exact step transmission probability ˆf (β) = 1

β e−V ‡β, the integrand goes

asymptotically to 0 as 1/(α

1 + iy).)

C. Below-barrier resonance

A small resonance in the form of a Lorentzian is added to the transmission probability

(5.2)

with parameters given in Fig. 13. The accuracy of the data is 10−6 and the features

are reproduced quite well. The oscillations at very low energy are side oscillations of the

resonance and it is possible to smooth them away. As outlined above, the resolution depends

12

on the energy of the feature. In order to reproduce a Lorentzian of width ε, it is necessary

to have at least a comparable resolution. To check whether the Lorentzian coming out of

the inversion is broadened because of lack of resolution, the signal can be shifted towards

In this example we took the Laplace transform of the reﬂection probability with βmax =

106. One may also use the transmission probability, however it diverges at β = 0 and so this

lower energy.

requires some care.

VI. DISCUSSION

In this paper we have resurrected and generalized a formula of Doetsch which enables a

direct Laplace inversion of a large class of functions. By suitable scaling, these can include

functions that are not L2 integrable. Therefore the algorithm is directly applicable to parti-

tion functions, for example. The method is relatively simple, all that is needed are two fast

Fourier transforms. It is not necessary to pre-smooth the data. The method is controllable,

the more accurate the Laplace inverted data, and the larger the range, the more accurate

are the inversion results. The parameters of the inversion are controlled by the accuracy of

the data only. As a result, the method is stable with respect to small perturbations.

We have shown that in practice, an extremely high quality inversion can be obtained

provided that the signal is also of very high accuracy. This is not merely an academic

exercise. For example, the Laguerre basis set may be taken, systematically inverted, and

the resulting numerical functions may be stored. Then the Laplace transformed function

may be expanded in terms of Laguerre polynomials. The inverted function is then obtained

merely by reading oﬀ the inverted Laguerre functions. The utility of such a procedure

depends on the qualitfy of the ﬁt of the polynomials to the numerical Laplace transformed

data.

It may be, that more sophisticated techniques should be used which include local

smoothing of the data, such as the DAFS methodology [33]. In any case, once the Laplace

transformed data is projected onto standard basis sets, the high accuracy inversion may be

13

used to obtain the inverted function.

An important property of the inversion technique is the fact that the resolution of the

resulting signal depends on the location of the signal. The closer it is to the origin, the higher

is the resolution. This allows for a shifting of the signal to obtain an increased resolution.

The price to be paid is that each shift demands knowledge of the function for larger values

of β. For analytic functions, such as the Laguerre polynomials, this does not present any

severe diﬃculty, as present day computers enable computations with very high accuracy,

which is also demonstrated for the harmonic oscillator partition function.

The Laplace inversion method presented in this paper is ideally suited for data obtained

from matrix multiplication schemes [31,32]. These methods produce the data at points

βj =

β2j [30], while the inversion requires βj = ej△x.

△

In this paper we have not considered correlation functions. Elsewhere [34] we will present

the application of the present method to spectra and correlation functions. In principle there

is no special complication except for the fact that in some cases a two dimensional inverse

Laplace transform has to be computed.

We have also not considered directly the numerical analytic continuation of functions.

As already mentioned in the Introduction, once the inverted function is obtained, it may

be Fourier transformed to obtain the analytically continued function.

In this sense, the

inversion technique presented in this paper may be thought of as a representation of the

complex valued Dirac δ function. The real question is one of practical usage, that is the

level of accuracy needed to obtain the real time function from the imaginary time function

as well as the range of β values needed for a given time length. Other applications are

the computation of moments of a probability distribution from its transform [35]. These

questions will be considered in future studies [34].

APPENDIX A: OPTIMIZING THE CHOICE OF α

We will outline how the parameter α can help reduce the numerical eﬀort drastically,

especially in high precision calculations.

The main numerical advantage of introducing α is a shortening of the integration interval

in x needed for obtaining g(y), cf. Eq.

(2.7). The range of integration [xmin, xmax] is

determined by the required accuracy ε = 10−m. The negative limit is mainly ﬁxed by the

exponential eαx,

xmin =

ln

1
α

ε
ˆC(0)

,

(6.1)

and the positive limit is due to the very rapid decay of ˆC(ex) which is almost independent

of α and is determined by the smallest decay rate. The larger α, the smaller the integra-

tion interval, but if α becomes too large the integrand increases exponentially, magnifying

uncertainties in the signal.

The maximum value of the integrand, if one exponential decay ˆC(β) = a0e−E0β is con-

sidered, is at xm = ln α/E0 and the integrand I(x) takes the value

I(xm) = a0eα(ln α/E0−1)

a0eα ln α ,

≈

(6.2)

which goes essentially as α!. The larger α, the more digits are required in the computation.

On the other hand, the outcome of the integration must cancel the denominator Γ(α + iy)

whose large y-asymptotics is given by Eq. (3.2). For a given ymax the order of magnitude of

Γ(α + iy) divided by the integrand at y = 0, Γ(α)

In summary, for large cut-oﬀ values ymax the stepsize in the x integration remains ap-

proximately the same. A change of α reduces the interval of the ﬁrst integration, but to

keep the same resolution (i.e. keep ymax ﬁxed) it is necessary to increase the precision m.

We found that for m

FIG. 2.

Inverse Laplace transform of a sum of four exponential decays with decay rates
En = 1, 2, 3, 4. The accuracy of the signal is taken as 3 decimal digits. The inversion of the original
data allows at most the estimation of the ﬁrst delta function (dashed line) at E = 1. The solid
line shows the inversion of the data shifted by δE = 0.9 to the left. The ﬁrst maximum can now
be estimated much more accurately.

FIG. 3. Magniﬁcation of the unshifted inversion of Fig. 2. The exact curve should yield
a delta function at E = 1.0. Due to the insuﬃcient accuracy of the data, the four components
overlap and distort the maximum to E

1.05.

FIG. 4. Magniﬁcation of the shifted inversion Fig. 2. The exact curve should yield a delta
function at E = 0.1. This value may now be estimated very accurately from the shifted data, even
though the accuracy (m = 3) is low.

FIG. 5. Numerical inverse Laplace transform for the partition function of the harmonic oscil-
(n + 1/2)). The two lines correspond to diﬀerent
lator. The exact inverse should yield
input signals whose accuracy (signiﬁcant decimal digits) is indicated in the insert. The value of
α = 4 was used for all computations with the harmonic oscillator partition function.

FIG. 6. High precision numerical inverse Laplace transform for the partition function of the

harmonic oscillator. Other notation is as in Fig. 5.

FIG. 7. Noisy data. The integrand of the real inversion formula for the partition function
of the harmonic oscillator is plotted vs. y. Gaussian noise with RMS deviation σ as indicated is
added to the signal and this leads to a reduction of the cut-oﬀ value for the y-integration.

FIG. 8. Noisy shifted data. The data used for Fig. 7 are shifted by Es = 0.4 to the left.
The cut-oﬀ values in y remain the same, but because of the faster oscillation of the integrand, the
resolution of the ﬁnal inversion peaks will be increased.

FIG. 9. Reﬂection probabilities for the Eckart barrier with two diﬀerent choices of the param-

eters. For all reﬂection probabilities we used α = 0.5.

FIG. 10. Logarithm of the error of the inverted reﬂection probability of the Eckart potential
with α = 4.0, V ‡ = 5.0. The signal for the inversion is obtained by numerical Laplace transform of
the exact reﬂection probability and the accuracy in decimal digits of the numerical Laplace integral
is indicated. The values for ymax are 5.5 and 12.0 for 3 and 8 digits accuracy respectively.

FIG. 11. Logarithm of the error of the inverted reﬂection probability of the Eckart potential
with α = 12.0, V ‡ = 5.0. Other notation is as in Fig. 10. The error increases near the step at
E = 5.0 due to Gibb’s phenomenon.

FIG. 12.

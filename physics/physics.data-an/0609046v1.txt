The value of stocks indices, and other assets, are examples of stochastic processes that drop
and raise in unpredictable ways. In this paper, we discuss certain asymmetries in short term price
movements that can not be attributed to a long term increasing trend. These empirical asymmetries
predict that price drops in stock indices on a relatively short time scale are more common than
the corresponding price raises, and we present several empirical examples of such asymmetries.
Furthermore, a simple model is introduced with the aim of explaining these facts. The prime idea is
to introduce occasional, short periods of dropping stock prices that are synchronized for all stocks
of the index. These collective negative price movements are imagined to be triggered by external
factors in our society that create fear for the future among the investors.
In the model this is
parameterized by a “fear factor” deﬁning how often such events take place. It is demonstrated that
such a simple fear factor model can reproduce several empirical facts concerning index asymmetries.
It is also pointed out that in its simplest form, it has certain shortcomings.

INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION

After, say, a major terroristic attack, like for instance, the September 11, 2001 attack on New York city, the
stock prices are known to drop rather systematically in most sectors of the economy. They do not drop because
fundamental factors in the economy as a whole have worsened (from one day to the next), but because the prospects
of the immediate future are considered to be highly unknown after such a dramatic incident. Investors simply fear
for what the future might bring, and that is reﬂected in the dropping share prices. In other words, the share prices
of a large fraction of stocks show collectively a negative development shortly after such a major triggering event [1].
These facts are rather well known, and one may give several other similar and related examples. Fortunately,
extreme events like those given above are not that frequent. One should therefore expect that collective draw-downs
are rather infrequent. On the contrary, we have found results that indicate that they are much more frequent than
one would have anticipated. One may say that there is a whole sequence of “mini-crashes” that are characterized by
synchronized downward asset price movements. This has the consequence that systematically and up to a well deﬁned
(short) timescale, it is consistently more probable that you will loose a certain percentage of your stock investment,
than gaining the same amount over the same time interval. This is a what we call a gain-loss asymmetry and it
has been observed in diﬀerent stock indices including the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), the SP500 and
NASDAQ [2], but not in, for instance, foreign exchange data [3].

In this paper, we will brieﬂy revisit some of the empirical facts of the gain-loss asymmetry. This serves to deﬁne the
phenomenon that one later tries to explain by the introduction of a simple (fear factor) model. This model introduces
the concept of a synchronization eﬀect, among the otherwise symmetric stocks that compose the index. This eﬀect
we see as a consequence of risk aversion (or fear for the future) among the investors that was triggered by factors that
may, or may not, be external to the market. In our interpretation, the results show that the concept of fear has a
deeper and more profound consequence on the structure of the stock market than one might have anticipated initially.

II. THE INVERSE STATISTICS APPROACH

A new statistical method, known as inverse statistics has recently been introduced [3, 4, 5, 6]. In economics, it
represents a time-dependent measure of how well an asset performs. Let S(t) denote the asset price at time t. Then
the logarithmic return at time t, calculated over a time interval ∆t, is deﬁned as [7, 8, 9] r∆t(t) = s(t + ∆t) − s(t),
where s(t) = ln S(t). We consider a situation where an investor aims for a given return level, ρ, that may be both
positive (being “long” on the market) or negative (being “short” on the market). If the investment is made at time
t, then the inverse statistics, also known as the investment horizon, is deﬁned as the time τρ(t) = ∆t so that the
inequality r∆t(t) ≥ ρ when ρ ≥ 0, or r∆t(t) ≤ ρ when ρ < 0, is satisﬁed for the ﬁrst time.

The inverse statistics histograms, or in economics, the investment horizon distribution, p (τρ), is the distribution of
all the available waiting times τρ(t) obtained by progressively moving through time t of the time series to be analyzed
(Fig. 1(a)). Notice that these methods, unlike the return distribution approach, do not require that the data are
equidistantly sampled. It is therefore well suited for tick-to-tick data.

If the return level ρ is not too small, like in Fig. 1(a), the distribution p (τρ) goes through a maximum. This
maximum occurs due to the fact that it takes time to drive prices through a certain level. This most probable time,
i.e. the maximum of the distribution, corresponds to what has been termed the optimal investment horizon [5] for a
given return level, ρ, and will below be denoted τ ∗
ρ .

III. EMPIRICAL RESULTS

In this section, we present some empirical results on the inverse statistics. The data set that will be used for this

purpose is the daily close of the DJIA covering its entire history from 1896 till today.

Fig. 1(a) depicts the empirical inverse statistics histograms — the investment horizon distribution — for (loga-
rithmic) return levels of ρ = 0.05 (open blue circles) and ρ = −0.05 (open red squares). The histograms possess
well deﬁned and pronounced maxima, the optimal investment horizons, followed by long 1/t3/2 power-law tails that
are well understood [7, 8, 9, 10]. The solid lines in Fig. 1(a) represent generalized inverse Gamma distributions [5]
ﬁtted towards the empirical histograms. This particular functional form is a natural candidate since it can be shown
that the investment horizon distribution is an inverse Gamma distribution[18], p(x) ∼ exp(a/2x)/x3/2 (a being a
parameter), if the analyzed asset price process is (a pure) geometrical Brownian motion [11, 12].

A striking feature of Fig. 1(a) is that the optimal investment horizons of the same magnitude, but opposite signs,
are diﬀerent. Thus the market as a whole, monitored by the DJIA, exhibits a fundamental gain-loss asymmetry.
Other indices, such as SP500 and NASDAQ, also show this asymmetry [2], while, for instance, foreign exchange data
do not [3].

Even more surprising is it that a similar well-pronounced asymmetry is not found for any of the individual stocks
that compose the DJIA [2]. This can be observed from the insert of Fig. 1(a), which shows the results of applying
the same procedure, individually, to these stocks, and subsequently averaging to improve statistics.

Fig. 2(a) depicts the empirical dependence of the optimal investment horizon (the maximum of the distribution),
τ ∗
ρ , as a function of the return level ρ. If the underlying stochastic price process was a geometrical Brownian motion,
ρ ∼ |ρ|γ, with γ = 2, valid for all return levels ρ (indicated by the lower dashed line in
then one can show that τ ∗
Fig.. 2(a)). Instead one empirically observes a diﬀerent behavior where there seems to be a weak (γ ≈ 0), or no,
dependence on the return level when it is small compared to the (daily) volatility, σ, of the index. For instance the
DJIA daily volatility is about σDJIA ≈ 1%. On the other hand a cross-over can be observed, for values of ρ somewhat
larger than σ, to a regime where the exponent γ is in the range of 1.8–2. It should be stressed that we do not insist,
based on the empirical data, on a power-law dependence of τ ∗
ρ on ρ. For this the statistics is too poor and there
seem to be some ρ dependence in γ. An additional interesting and apparent feature to notice from Fig. 2(a) is the
consistent, almost constant, relative gain-loss asymmetry over a signiﬁcant wide range of return levels.

In light of these empirical ﬁndings the following interesting and fundamental question arises: How can it be that
the index exhibits a pronounced asymmetry, while the individual stocks do not? It is to address exactly this question
that the model that we are about to introduce was invented.

IV. THE FEAR FACTOR MODEL

Recently the present authors introduced a so-called fear factor model in order to explain the empirical gain-loss
asymmetry [1]. The prime idea is to introduce occasional, short periods of dropping stock prices that are synchronized
between the N stocks comprising the stock index. These collective stock price drops, are in essence what in the model
gives rise to the asymmetry of the index [1]. We rationalize such a behavior with the emergence of anxiety and fear

among the investors, a state that may be triggered by events external to the economy. Since we herein are mainly
interested in day-to-day behavior of the market, it will be assumed that the stochastic processes of the stocks are all
equivalent and consistent with a geometrical Brownian motion [7, 8, 13]. This implies that the logarithm of the stock
prices, si(t) = ln Si(t), follow standard, unbiased, random walks

si(t + 1) = si(t) + εi(t)δ ,

i = 1, . . . , N,

where δ > 0 denotes the (common) ﬁxed log-price increment (by assumption), and εi(t) = ±1 is a random time-
dependent direction variable. At certain time steps, chosen randomly with fear factor probability p, all stocks
synchronize their draw downs (εi = −1). For the remaining time steps, the diﬀerent stocks move independently
of one another. To make sure that the overall behavior of every single stock is according to a geometric Brownian
motion (as assumed), a slight upward bias, quantiﬁed by the probability q = 1/(2(1 − p)) [1], is introduced as a
“compensating” mechanism during the non-synchronized periods. From the price realizations of the N single stocks,
one may construct the corresponding price-weighted index, like the DJIA, according to

Here d(t) denotes the divisor of the index (at time t) that for simplicity has been ﬁxed to the value d(t) = N . For
more technical details about the model, the interested reader is referred to Ref. [1].

The above model is minimalistic, and it therefore includes aspects that are known not to be realistic. Work is in
progress to extend the present model by including into it more realistic and complex features. In particular, we have
implemented fear factor models including splits, mergers and replacements and economic sectors each having their own
fear factor. Moreover, other extensions include more realistic (fat-tailed) price increment distributions [7, 8, 9, 14]
as well as time-dependent stochastic volatility for the single stocks [7, 8, 9, 15, 16]. The detailed results of these
extensions will be reported elsewhere [17].

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We will now address the results that can be obtained by the fear factor model and compare them with the empirical
ﬁndings. Fig. 1(b) shows that the model can indeed produce a clear gain-loss asymmetry in the inverse statistic
histograms. Hence, the main goal of the model can be said to have been reached. Moreover, the investment horizon
distributions are qualitatively very similar to what is found empirically for the DJIA (cf. Fig. 1(a)). In particular, one
observes from Fig. 1(b) that the positions of the peaks found empirically (vertical dashed lines) are predicted rather
accurately by the model. To produce these results of Fig. 1(b), a fear factor of p = 0.05 was used. In passing, it is
observed, as expected, that the model with p = 0 does not produce any asymmetry (grey dashed line in Fig. 1(b)).

A detailed comparison of the shapes of the empirical and the modeled inverse statistics curves reveals some minor
diﬀerences, especially for short waiting times and the height of the ρ > 0 histogram. One could ﬁnd simple explanations
for these diﬀerences, such as the fact that the model does not consider a realistic jump size distribution, or even that
it does not include an “optimism factor” synchronizing draw-ups. This would result in a wider ρ > 0 distribution for
short waiting times, and additionally would lower the value of the maximum. Some of the these shortcomings of the
minimalistic model has already been dealt with by the more realistic and complex extensions mentioned above [17].
For the sake of this paper, however, none of these extension will be further discussed in detail.

Fig. 2(b) depicts the optimal investment horizon vs. return level obtained from our fear factor model. It is observed
that for ρ > 0 the empirical result for the DJIA (solid line in Fig. 2(b)) is reasonably well reproduced. One exception
is for the largest return levels, where a value of γ = 2 seems to be asymptotically approached. This might not be so
unexpected since this is the geometric Brownian motion value. However, the situation is diﬀerent for the ρ < 0 case.
Here the empirical behavior is not reproduced very accurately. Consistent with the empirical ﬁndings, a gain-loss
asymmetry gap, τ ∗
−|ρ|, starts to open up for return levels ρ around, and somewhat larger than, the volatility
of the index σ. Unlike what can be observed from Fig. 2(a), the gap, however, seems to close again for large return
levels. The numerical data seems also to indicate that the closing of the gain-loss asymmetry gap results in a data
collapse onto a universal τ ∗

ρ ∼ ργ curve with exponent γ = 2.

+|ρ| − τ ∗

We will now argue why this is a plausible scenario. Even during a synchronous event, when all stocks drop
simultaneously, there is a limit to how large the drop in the index may be. One can readily show (cf. Eq. (4) of
Ref. [1]) that the relative returns of the index during a synchronous event occurring at t + 1 is

∆I(t)
I(t)

=

I(t + 1) − I(t)
I(t)

= exp(−δ) − 1 < 0,

(3)

which also is a good approximation to the corresponding logarithmic return as long as I(t) ≫ ∆I(t) [8]. This
(negative) synchronous index drop sets a scale for the problem. One has essentially three diﬀerent regions, all of
diﬀerent properties, depending on the applied level of return. They are characterized by the return level ρ being (i)
much smaller than; (ii) comparable to; or (iii) much larger than the synchronous index drop exp(−δ) − 1.In the ﬁrst
case, the synchronization does not have much of an eﬀect, and there is essentially no dependence on the return level
or its sign. For the intermediate range, where ρ is comparable to exp(−δ) − 1, the asymmetric eﬀect is pronounced
since no equivalent positive returns are very probable for the index (unless the fear factor is very small). Speciﬁcally,
whenever ρ < exp(−δ) − 1 one collective draw-down event is suﬃcient to cross the lower barrier of the index, thereby
resulting in an exit time coinciding with the time of the synchronization. This is of course not the case when ρ > 0
which represents the working mechanism in the model for the asymmetry at short time scales. For the ﬁnal case, where
ρ ≫ exp(−δ) − 1, neither the synchronized downward movements, or the sign of the return level, play an important
role for the barrier crossing. However, in contrast to case (i) above, the waiting times are now much longer, so that
the geometrical Brownian character of the stock process is observed. This is reﬂected in Fig. 2(b) by the collapse onto
what seems to be an indication of a common scaling behavior with γ = 2 independent of the sign of the return level
The last topic that we will address in this paper is also related to an asymmetry, but takes on a somewhat diﬀerent
In particular, we have studied the probability that the DJIA index

goes down, respectively up, over a day and have found that there is a 9% larger probability to go down than to go
up. Based on this information, we performed a more systematic study by considering the number of consecutive time
steps, nt, the index drops or raises. This probability distribution will be denoted by p±(nt), where the subscripts +/−
refers to price raise/drop. The open symbols of Fig. 3 show that the empirical results, based on daily DJIA data, are
consistent with decaying exponentials of the form p±(nt) ∼ exp(−γ± |nt|), where γ± > 0 are parameters (or rates). It
is surprising to observe that also this quantity exhibits an asymmetry in the sense that γ+ 6= γ−. These rates, obtained
by exponential regression ﬁts to the empirical DJIA data, are γ+ = (0.62 ± 0.01) days−1 and γ=(0.74 ± 0.03) days−1.
So what does the fear factor model, say about the same probabilities? In Fig. 3 the dashed lines are the predictions
of the model and they surprisingly well reproduce the empirical facts. They correspond to the following parameters
γ+ = 0.62 days−1 and γ− = 0.78 days−1 for the raise and drop curves, respectively. However, the fear factor used to
obtain these results was p = 0.02. This is slightly lower than what was needed to get consistent results for the inverse
statistics histograms of Figs. 2 and in this respect, the model has an obvious deﬁciency. It should be stressed, though,
that it is still a highly non-trivial task, with one adjustable parameter, to reproduce correctly the two diﬀerent rates
(γ±) for the two probabilities. That such a good quantitative agreement with real data is possible must be judged as
a strength of the model, even if in its simplest form, it is not fully consistent.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOKS

In conclusion, we have brieﬂy reviewed what seems to be a new stylized fact for stock indices that show a pronounced
gain-loss asymmetry. We have described a so-called minimalistic “fear factor” model that conceptually attributes
this phenomenon to occasional synchronizations of the composing stocks during some (short) time periods due to
fear emerging spontaneously among investors likely triggered by external world events. This minimalistic model do
represent a possible mechanism for the gain-loss asymmetry, and it reproduces many of the empirical facts of the
inverse statistics. In its simplest form, it also shows some shortcomings, some of which have been identiﬁed in this
paper. Within the context of the model, the reason for these deﬁciencies are understood, and work is in progress to
address these issues.

DJIA obtained on the basis of the empirical daily close data covering its entire history of 110 years from 1896. The red open
squares are obtained using a loss level of ρ = −0.05 and the blue open circles are obtained using a gain level of ρ = +0.05
and both distributions are normalized. Note the clear asymmetry between the loss and the gain statistics. The full curves
are regression ﬁts using a generalized inverse Gamma distribution [3, 5, 6]. The inset shows the distributions obtained from
using the same procedure on the individual stocks of the DJIA, and subsequently averaging over the stocks. Notice that the
asymmetry is absent for individual stocks. (b) The results for the inverse statistics obtained within the fear factor model using
parameters characterizing the DJIA and used to produce the empirical results of Fig. 1(a). In particular it was used that the
index consists of N = 30 stocks and the return level was set to ρ/σ = 5, where ρ is the return level and σ denotes the daily
volatility of the index. In the model the index volatility, σ, should reﬂect the observed 1% daily volatility of the DJIA, and the
ρ/σ = ±5 therefore corresponds to ρ = ±5% in Fig. 1(a). A fear factor of p = 0.05 was chosen to reproduce the positions of
the two asymmetric maxima appearing in Fig. 1(a) and indicated by dashed vertical lines. The dashed thick line is the result
for a fear-factor parameter p = 0, in which case the asymmetry vanishes. As in Fig. 1(a), the inset shows the loss and gain
distributions for the individual stocks in the model. Notice, that here the asymmetry is also absent.

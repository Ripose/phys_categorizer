Trend arbitrage, bid-ask spread and
market dynamics

Nikolai Zaitsev∗
(submitted to ”Quantitative ﬁnance” journal)

May-June 2006

Abstract

Microstructure of market dynamics is studied through analysis of
tick price data. Linear trend is introduced as a tool for such analysis.
Trend arbitrage inequality is developed and tested. The inequality sets
limiting relationship between trend, bid-ask spread, market reaction
and average update frequency of price information. Average time of
market reaction is measured from market data. This parameter is
interpreted as a constant value of the stock exchange and is attributed
to the latency of exchange reaction to actions of traders. This latency
and cost of trade are shown to be the main limit of bid-ask spread.
Data analysis also suggests some relationships between trend, bid-ask
spread and average frequency of price update process.

Introduction

Question about market microdynamics is of fundamental importance. It in-
ﬂuences wide range of items: bid-ask spread dynamics, interaction of market
agents setting market and limit orders, patterns of price formation and provi-
sion of liquidity. These subjects are investigated using wide range of analytic
tools, trying to capture cross-correlation structure of price evolution and
volatilities through time series analysis [Roll] or studying dynamics of price
formation through simulation of detailed market mechanics [Smith et.al.] 1.
These methods concentrate on search of the source of random forces acting
over continuous or discrete time sets. These sets are considered homoge-
neous when long-term returns are considered. On the shorter scale (in tick
data), it is noticed that the trading frequency scales the returns making
time sets non-homogeneous. Theoretical construction is built in [Derman]
to account for such eﬀect.

In contrast to statistical methods, the behavioral ﬁnance searches pat-
terns of dynamics of collective actions of various market agents making as-
sumptions about their perception and searching for equilibrium and/or lim-
iting solution to price/spread prediction problem [Schleifer, Bondarenko].

All above mentioned methods analyze price returns. In this article we
introduce new object for such analysis, a trend 2. Common deﬁnition of
trend is ”the general direction in which something tends to move”. Visually
trend can be identiﬁed as a line with little random deviations. Of course,
trends were studied many times before. However, they were studied often
in relation to question of deterministic behavior of price.

We think, that the existence of trend is not necessarily determinis-
tic and in general does not disapprove statistical nature of price behavior.
Indeed, there is a non-zero probability to ﬁnd straight line in price path gen-
erated using, for example, Black-Scholes model [Durlauf]. Despite this fact,
crowd of market participants still believes that such trends are due to some
hidden bits of information and therefore contribute to trend persistence or
otherwise.

In this paper we would like to merge these two ideas of considering
price evolution through scope of trend and through random walk. Indeed,
the presentation of price path in terms of price returns (random walk) is
suitable in connection to CAPM and alike theories, where proﬁt and risks
are related in search of optimal investment portfolio. On the other side,
presentation of price evolution in terms of short-term price trends better
conforms description of market microdynamics.

The trend is an object worth to study because as we show it gives in-
sight into microstructure of market dynamics. It allows direct observation
of spread dynamics, price information update, costs, trading activity and
response time of the exchange. This information is diluted when correlation
analysis of price return series is used. In this paper trends are studied with-
out consideration of news impact to the price move but only in relation to
dynamics of agents interaction via exchange.

Exchange is a dynamic system. It allows traders to interact with each
other. It consists of many components. These parts are specialists on the
ﬂoor, electronic platform which helps to account and match trades through
software and a wire connection to trader computers. Traders use electronic
platforms to trade. Both systems, of traders and of exchange, have their
respective non-zero latencies and therefore the speed of information diﬀusion
is non-zero 3. The latencies inﬂuence price dynamics and respective trading
algorithms.

This study draws attention to the inﬂuence of dynamics of systems used
2In fact, trend was studied many times before, but in context of technical analysis
and it was always interpreted as an evidence to some non-random (deterministic) price
behavior.

3At the end, there is a hard limit of speed of light in the transmission cables.

for trading on the dynamics of price. We extract information content of
such dynamics from trends and spreads data.

The article is organized as follows. First, we discuss trend arbitrage. The
respective relationship has been derived and is taken as starting point to
further analysis. Second, one applies an algorithm searching for linear trend
in time series of bids and asks observed on stock markets. Third, several
distributions are obtained to support the relationship developed from trend
arbitrage requirement. Several outcomes have been discussed as well.

2 Trend Arbitrage

In the following, one analyze intra-day trend seen in prices of an asset which
is traded in double auction.

For brevity of explanation we assume two kind of market agents: Special-
ists and Investors. Specialists maintain sell- and buy-prices (asks and bids,
respectively) in continuous manner. Bids and asks generally move together.
Spread between them (spread=ask-bid) tends to some minimum level due
to competition between Specialists. This level depends on risk perceived by
Specialists to take their market share. In stress situations, especially when
price directionally moves to the new level, spread increases. The question
now is what this dependency is.

A simple example helps to ﬁnd an answer. Specialist provides bid and ask
prices earning spread. Investor proﬁts by taking directional bets. Suppose
now that the price moves within up-trend, µ, with spread, Spr, see Figure 1.

Investor buys asset at ask-price, p1, at t1 moment. After a while he sells it.
If the trend did not change its direction and Investor waits long enough, till
time t2, he can sell asset at bid-price, p2. Investor will make no proﬁt if:

0 ≥ p2 − p1 − Spr + µ · (t2 − t1)

(1)

Investor must meet three conditions to proﬁt for sure:

• |µ| is non decreasing during the period between t1 and t2;

• trading system of Investor is faster than that of Specialist and trading
system of Specialist is slower than some market reaction value, τ ;

• spread is small enough, satisfying (1).

Knowing these conditions (consciously or not), Specialist sets spread

such that he makes no losses, i.e. p2 is kept equal to p1 or less.

Same arguments are applied to down-trend, which changes µ to |µ|.

Therefore, (1) is modiﬁed and limit on spread can be set:

Spr ≥ |µ| · τ

where τ = t2−t1. More general expression must also include additional costs
to be paid by Investor related to his trading activity and some structure of
characteristic time, τ :

Spr ≥ |µ| · (τM + τS) + f ee

where f ee is a broker fee and similar additive costs, τM is exchange-wide
latency and τS is stock speciﬁc latency. τS can be attributed to aggregated
latencies of trading platforms used by Investors to trade the same stock.

These inequalities suggest that the non-zero spread is due to both, trans-

action costs and latencies of trading and exchange systems.

Now, let us look at the relationships through data analysis perspective.

3 Data analysis

3.1 Data

Tick price/volume data of 33 stocks traded at Amsterdam (NLD), Frankfurt
(GER), Madrid (SPA), Paris (FRA) and Milan (ITL) were collected over
the second half of the year 2003. This data includes bid, ask and trade prices
and respective volumes attached to time stamps. Time period considered is

4

between 15:30 and 17:30 of European time 4. Dividend information was not
used because it does not aﬀect our intraday analysis.

Data were ﬁltered. Only those bits of information were used in analysis
where price of either bid or ask has been updated. Any such change is
treated as ”information update”.

3.2 Trend identiﬁcation

Linear ﬁt (details can be found elsewhere [Wiki]) was applied to series of
one day mid-prices, (ask(ti) + bid(ti))/2. Bid-ask spread, ǫ(ti) = (ask(ti) −
bid(ti)), is understood as an uncertainty of observed price information (this
item to be discussed further). Data were ﬁt continuously. This way real-time
feed is simulated, where only past information is available. An output of ﬁt
is series of current trend parameters such as series of impact, p0(ti), series of
slope (trend), µ(ti), with respective errors, ǫp(ti), ǫµ(ti). These parameters
allow prediction of forward price, ˜p, and price error, ǫ:

˜p(ti) = p(p0(ti−1), µ(ti−1), ti), and

˜ǫ(ti) = ǫ(p0(ti−1), µ(ti−1), ǫp(ti−1), ǫµ(ti−1), ti).

Condition to trigger end of current trend:

|˜p(ti) − p(ti)|
2
q ˜ǫ(ti)

+ ǫ(ti)2

> n

where n is cut value, which is chosen to be equal to 2.3. This particular
choice of cut-oﬀ value was determined visually from trends superimposed
on the price plot (see Figure (2). There is an intuitive feeling that the
less cut-oﬀ value generates too many spurious trends and dilutes eﬀects we
are looking for. Use of price returns is a limiting case for trends with just
two points. On the other side, the larger cut-oﬀ value will lead to reduced
sensitivity of spread information to trends.

Trend search starts at the beginning of each day series with a seed of

three points. Algorithm continues to ﬁt line till the trigger (6) is hit.
then assumes that within the search time window (between current point
and the beginning of current trend) there are two trends. Algorithm starts
backward search in order to ﬁnd an optimal breaking time point between
current and forward trends. The point is found at the minimum of χ2
t =
(χ2
t )i are of current (i = cur) and of forward (i =
f wd) trends. This point becomes the end of current trend and the start of
forward one. The forward trend becomes current. And so on till the end of
day. Each trend is then accompanied with respective information:

3.3 Price uncertainty

Trend measurement rises important question: what is the measure-
ment error of observed price? One possibility is to interpret mid-prices
as observed exactly with equal weights. The errors of ﬁtted line param-
eters can be estimated from the sample in a standard way. Another
way is to assume that the price is governed by some diﬀusion process
and therefore to interpret estimated volatility as current price errors.
Both methods seem not acceptable since they do not bear instant in-
formation about price uncertainty.

We believe that the bid-ask spread is a good candidate to estimate in-
stant price uncertainty. In principle, the price error (and spread) must
be dependent on the volume to be traded by some arbitrage algorithm,
which uses the trend ﬁt. In this case all analysis will change. In this
research we concentrate on analysis of the best bids-asks dynamics
alone.
Example of distribution of χ2
t -probability (see Figure 3) demonstrates
that our choice is overall correct because the probability is mostly
ﬂattened in range [0,1] 5 peaking at 1.

for several other stocks indicate their similarity to log-normal p.d.f. and

is calibrated using max(0, f (x)), where f (x) is log-normal function. The
front-end value is calculated at 1% of ﬁtted log-normal p.d.f.. τM values per

Measurement of f ee and τM parameters for all three groups for all stocks
are given in the Table 2. Division of Investors into three groups is a reason-
able approach and reﬂects market situation when the less automation, the
slower their response to signals, the larger the fee (see Figure 9). The result
also justiﬁes our assumption that f ee = 0 when |µ| is large. F ee values
obtained from the ﬁt are too big and probably must be attributed to some
other source than trading costs, however, we clearly see that the structure
of (7) is established correctly.

We realize that the division into groups of Investors is voluntary and is
not covered by the model described in (7). This eﬀect should be accounted
in future developments.

Concluding the test of inequality (9) we see that in average market pre-
serves the trend arbitrage requirements. In particular situations, however,
given on page 4, an arbitrage is still possible.

4.2 Tick size and Specialists activity

4.2.1 Formula

Tick size, dp, is another important ingredient of the trend arbitrage equation.
Let us use similar arguments about trend arbitrage (like used in section 2,
”Trend arbitrage”). Consider the same situation when ask prices move with
up-trend (see Figure 1). If to assume that the price is updated every time
when the expected price becomes larger than the current one by tick-size,
the number of price updates should be:

Nu ∼

∆p
dp

=

|µ|∆T
dp

and therefore

dp ∼ |µ|

= |µ|τu

∆T
Nu

(8)

where, ∆T is duration of the trend, ∆p is price change and Nu is number of
ask updates during same period and τu is average update time alongside the
trend. Which sign must be used in the relationship, (=) or strict inequality,
is diﬃcult to say because the spread compensates for low update frequency.
Therefore we leave (∼)-sign.

4.2.2 Analysis

Data demonstrate, that distribution of µ·τu follows normal distribution with
some tails, which can be attributed to some ineﬃciency in the process, see
Figure 10. Tick size is covered within 3σ of the distribution. It means that
price update happens more often than necessary giving almost no chance
for trend arbitrage.

Figure 11 plots the 3σ(µτ )/dp of µτ distributions for all stocks under
consideration. We see that with few exceptions update frequency is such
that 3σ of µτ is within tick size which conﬁrms our proposition.

The general conclusion is that the tick size closely inﬂuences trading
activity by pushing Specialists to update their future price view. The larger
tick size, the less Specialist is motivated to do so. We see such pattern for
some stocks of Euronext. When their price crosses 50 euros boundary 7 the
price update frequency drops accordingly.

Following trend arbitrage logic, if the tick size is small but exchange or
trading systems are slow (e.g. Specialists trading on ﬂoor), then the 3σ(µτ )
must be larger than 1. If this is not compensated with larger spread the
arbitrage exists.

7Euronext rules that tick size is 0.01 euro for price stock < 50 euro and it is 0.05 for

price stock > 50 euro and < 500 euro.

Performing the same measurement of τM as in section 4.1.1 we ﬁnd that the
distinction between exchanges is almost removed and is now ranges between

distribution as it was done before in section 4.1.2 reveals (see Figure 13)
that tick size, dp, absorbs both τS and (probably) τM , therefore, reducing
(9) to the following:

Spr − dp ≥ τM · µ + f ee

We may conclude from this result, that (8) absorbs all stock speciﬁc

i.e. direct measurement of all latencies within exchange and traders com-
puters/software.

4.2.3 Simulation: Trends in Random walk model and return-

trend duality

A simpliﬁed model of price evolution has been implemented to understand
empirical results. The price increment of this model follows dS = σdW .
Trend search algorithm (given in section 3.2) is imposed to generated price
time series. Trends found with that procedure are stored in the same fashion
as we did for real data.

Two important points have to be mentioned:

• The model assumes generation of prices at equal time intervals, i.e.

trading activity is not simulated and

• Spread is assumed to be constant and is not dependent on the trend;

In particular, the model reproduces Normal distribution of |µ|τu for all
tracks. This leads to an idea that the description of price evolution with
some random walk model is equivalent to description of price via trends,
which also can be stochastic 8.

To be more speciﬁc let us consider some stochastic model describing price
dynamics, like Black-Scholes model, BS(µ, σ; ǫ) with growth rate, µ, volatil-
ity, σ, and ǫ, some value to cut the trend, like n in (6), as parameters. Then,
there is a homeomorphic transformation in parametric space into another
model describing same price dynamics in terms of trends, T (µ, ∆T ; q), with
trend slope, µ, trend duration, ∆T , and quality, q, as parameters. Quality,
q, characterizes amount of ﬂuctuations around trend (spread dynamics).

It is diﬃcult to interpret meaning of this relationship, because dimen-
sionalities of l.h.s and r.h.s. of equation (11), [sec] and [secβ], are diﬀerent.
There is some reference model though [SABR], which suggests fractionality
of return process:

dF = aF βdW1; da = νadW2; dW1dW2 = ρdt

(12)

The main diﬀerence, however, with the mentioned result is that SABR-
model describes process of last prices, while equation (11) describes bid-ask
update. The relationship between bid-ask update process and trade process
is subject of the next article.

5 Conclusions and prospects

The presented analysis has demonstrated importance of analysis of short-
term trends as it gives better insight into micro-dynamics of the market.

Using simple mechanistic arguments the trend arbitrage inequality is
developed. Empirical tests prove the inequality to hold. The inequality sets
limit on bid-ask spread which is determined by the latencies of exchange and
trading systems and by some costs. These latencies can also be identiﬁed
directly by measuring delay between sending time of the order from traders
computer and appearance of this order in the exchange book.

Using same arguments, the tick size is related to frequency of price up-
date by Specialist. Analysis of trend inequality with data allowed us to
measure latencies of exchange

Flat distribution of probability of χ2

t of trend ﬁt demonstrates that the
spread bears instant information about price uncertainty in the process of
price measurement. Indeed, from the point of view of Investor the next last
price will be within the current bid-ask spread.

Structure of trend arbitrage is in general captured correctly. In particu-

lar, it allows to see division of market participants by their speed.

Further analysis suggests some strong relationship between spread, trend
and time of trades update. Although dimensionality problem of the equation
remains, the theoretical explanation of this phenomenon is still waiting to
appear.

The ﬁnal conclusion is that the price evolution can be equally described
through random walk or trends. However, market participants induce such
spread dynamics as the trend exists and they limit their actions to conform
trend arbitrage requirement.

In the future research, we plan to investigate relationship between price
update and trading processes using the same type of analysis of trend asso-
ciated information. Some model development will take place as well.

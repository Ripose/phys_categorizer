The Auto Regressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (ARCH) and its Generalized version (GARCH) family of
models have grown to encompass a wide range of speciﬁcations, each of which is designed to enhance the ability
of the model to capture the characteristics of stochastic data, such as ﬁnancial indices. The existing literature
provides little guidance on how to select optimal parameters, which are critical in efﬁciency of the model, among
the inﬁnite range of available parameters. We introduce a new criterion to ﬁnd suitable parameters in GARCH
model. This criterion shows that the Standard GARCH (1,1) model works well for the majority of indices. In
this way, we establish a basis for why the (1,1) model works well.

INTRODUCTION

The ARCH model (Engle, 1982) and standard GARCH
model (Bollerslev, 1986) are now not only widely used in the
Foreign Exchange (FX) literature (Bollerslev et al., 1993) but
also as the basic framework for empirical studies of the mar-
ket micro-structure such as the impact of news (Goodhart and
Figliuoli, 1991; Goodhart et al., 1993) and government inter-
ventions (Goodhart and Hesse, 1993; Peiers, 1994), or inter-
and intra-market relationships (Engle et al., 1990; Baillie and
Bollerslev, 1990). Due to basic similarities between the men-
tioned models of different contents, here we focus our discus-
sion on ﬁnancial context.

The main assumption behind this class of models is the rel-
ative homogeneity of the price discovery process among mar-
ket participants at the origin of the volatility process. Volatil-
ity is an essential ingredient for many applied issues in ﬁ-
nance, for example, in asset pricing, asset allocation, or risk
management (Michael Schroder and Martin Schuler)[ref2].
It is becoming more important to have a good measure and
forecast of short-term volatility, mainly at the one to ten
day horizon. Currently, the main approaches to compute
volatilities are by historical indicators computed from daily
squared or absolute valued returns, by econometric models
such as GARCH. In other words, the conditional density of
one GARCH process can adequately capture the information.
In particular, GARCH parameters for the weekly frequency
theoretically derived from daily empirical estimates are usu-
ally within the conﬁdence interval of weekly empirical esti-
mates (Drost and Nijman, 1993). It is interesting to note that
despite the extensive list of models which now belong to the
ARCH family (Andersen and Bollerslev, 1994; Bera and Hig-
gins, 1993; Bollerslev and Domowitz, 1993), the existing lit-
erature provides little guidance on how to select optimal p and
q values in a GARCH (p,q) model. The two parameters p and
q in GARCH model refer to history of the return and volatil-
ity of data of index (or price) , respectively. However, there
are some criteria to ﬁnd the suitable p and q. Pagan and Sabu
(1992), suggest a misspeciﬁed volatility equation that can re-
sult in inconsistent maximum likelihood estimates of the con-

ditional mean parameters and BIC (Solibakke,2001 and refer-
ences therein ). Further West and Cho(1994), and Brooks and
Bruke(1998) show how appropriate GARCH model selection
can be used to enhance the accuracy of exchange rate volatil-
ity forecasts. However, there is an almost ubiquitous reliance
on the standard GARCH (1,1)-type model in the applied liter-
ature.

As our starting point we proceed by stressing on the role
of p and q in the GARCH model and their similarity to the
Markov length scale in stochastic processes. Many natural or
man-made phenomena, such as morphology of many physi-
cal systems and ﬂuctuations in the stock market prices, are
characterized by a degree of stochasticity( Torquato, 2002 and
Sahimi 2003). These systems are typical examples of Markov
processes (Friedrich and Peinke,1997, Friedrich,et al., 2000,
Parisi,et al. 1997, Friedrich, et al., 2000, Siefert, et al., 2003,
Kriso, et al., 2002, Siegert,et al. 1998, Jafari, et al.,2003).
Generally, We check whether the data follow a Markov chain
and, if so, measure the Markov length scale tM . Such a
given process with a degree of randomness or stochasticity
may have a ﬁnite or an inﬁnite Markov length scale. Speciﬁ-
cally, the Markov length scale is the minimum length interval
over which the data can be considered as a Markov process.
The main goal of this paper is to utilize the mentioned simi-
larity between the role of p and q in the GARCH model and
Markov time scale in stochastic processes, and introduce a
novel method to estimate optimal GARCH model parameters
of intra-daily data. However, Usage of our approach is not re-
stricted to this application. It is known that in many relevant
applications it is highly desired to know the dynamics of the
parameters.

GARCH BASED VOLATILITY MODELS

GARCH model has become important tool in the analysis
of time series data, particularly in ﬁnancial applications. This
model is especially useful when the goal of the study is to
analyze and forecast volatility.

The GARCH model, which stand for Generalized Auto Re-

gressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity, is designed to pro-
vide a volatility measure like a standard deviation that can be
used in ﬁnancial decisions concerning risk analysis, portfolio
selection and derivative pricing.

Let the dependent variable be denoted by rt, which could
be the return on an asset or portfolio. The mean value µ and
the variance σ2 will be deﬁned relative to past information set.
Then, the return r in present will be equal to the mean value of
r (that is ,the expected value of r based on past information)
plus the standard deviation of r times error term for present
period.

The challenge is to specify how the information is used to
forecast the mean and variance of the return, conditional on
the past information. The primary descriptive tool was the
rolling standard deviation. This is the standard deviation cal-
culated using a ﬁxed number of the most recent observations.
It assumes that the variance of tomorrow’s return is an equally
weighted average of the squared residual from the past days.
The assumption of equal weights seems unattractive as one
would think that the more recent events would be more rele-
vant and therefore should have higher weights. Furthermore
the assumption of zero weights for observations more than
one period old, is also unattractive. The GARCH model for
variance looks like this (Engle 1982):

t = α0 + α1r2
σ2

t−1 + ....... + αpr2

t−p

+ β1σ2

t−1 + ....... + βqσ2

The parameters α′
is, must be estimated. Among the
GARCH models, the GARCH(1,1) model is widely studied in
the economic literature (Bollerslev 1992). In this model, up-
dating simply requires knowing the previous forecast σ2 and
β1, β1, α1) and the long
residual. The weights are (1
−
run average variance is √ α0
1−α1−β1 . It should be noted that this
only works if α1 + β1 < 1, and only really makes series if the
weights are positive requiring α1 > 0, β1 > 0, α0 > 0. Such
a model, is often studied in the modeling of prices of ﬁnancial
assets. The ﬁrst number refers to how many autoregressive
lags or ARCH terms appear in the equation, while the second
number refers to how many moving average lags are speci-
ﬁed which here is often called the number of GARCH terms.
Sometimes models with more than one lag are needed to ﬁnd
good variance forecasts. For estimating on equation like the
GHARCH(1, 1) when the only variable on which there are
data is rt we can use maximum likelihood by replacing condi-
tional variance for unconditional variance in the normal like-
lihood and then maximizing with respect to the parameters.
The likelihood function provides a systematic way to adjust
the parameters a, b, c to yield the best ﬁt.

MARKOV PROCESS

Complete information about the stochastic process would
be available by the knowledge of all possible n-point, or

2

more precisely n-scale, joint probability density functions,
p(r1, t1; r2, t2; ...; rn, tn), describing the probability of ﬁnd-
ing simultaneously the return r1 on the scale t1, r2 on the
scale t2, and so forth up to rn on the scale tn. Without loss
of generality we take t1 < t2 < ... < tn (Risken 1984 and
Hanggi 1982). As a ﬁrst question, one has to ask for a suit-
able simpliﬁcation. In any case, the n-scale joint probability
density function (pdf) can be expressed by multi-conditional
pdf

p(

r1, t1; r2, t2; ...; rn, tn) = p(r1, t1
p(r2, t2

r3, t3; ...; rn, tn)...p(rn−1, tn−1

rj, tj) denotes a conditional probability of ﬁnd-
Here, p(ri, ti
|
ing the return ri on the scale ti under the condition that si-
multaneously, i.e. at the same time t, on a larger scale tj the
value rj was found. It is deﬁned with the help of the joint
probability p(ri, ti; rj, tj) as:

p(ri, ti

rj , tj) =
|

p(ri, ti; rj , tj)
p(rj, tj)

(3)

An important simpliﬁcation arises if

p(ri, ti

ri+1, ti+1; ...; rn, tn) = p(ri, ti
|

ri+1, ti+1)
|

(4)

This property is the deﬁning feature of a Markov process
evolving from ri+1 to ri. Thus for a Markov process the n-
scale joint pdf factorize into n conditional pdf

p(r1, t1; ...; rn, tn) = p(r1, t1

r2, t2)...
|

×

p(rn−1, tn−1

rn, tn)p(rn, tn) (5)
|

The Markov property implies that the t-dependence of r can
be regarded as a stochastic process evolving in r. Here it
should be noted that if condition (4) holds this is true for a
process evolving in t from large down to small scales as well
as reversely from small to large scales. Equation (5) also em-
phasizes the fundamental meaning of conditional probabilities
for Markov processes since they determine any n-scale joint
pdf and thus the complete statistics of the process.

As it is well known, a given process with a degree of
randomness or stochasticity may have a ﬁnite or an inﬁnite
Markov time (length) scale (Risken 1984, Hanggi et al 1982).
The proposed method utilizes a set of data for a phenomenon
which contains a degree of stochasticity. We begin by de-
scribing the procedure that lead to ﬁnd optimal GARCH pa-
rameters (p, q) based on the (stochastic) data set: As the ﬁrst
step we check whether the return (volatility) of data follow
a Markov chain and, if so, measure the Markov length scale
tM and introduce p(q) equal to tM . To determine the Markov
scale tM for return, we note that a complete characterization
of the statistical properties of stochastic ﬂuctuations of a quan-
tity r in terms of a parameter t requires the evaluation of the
joint pdf Pn(r1, t1; ; rn, tn) for an arbitrary n, the number of
the data points. If the phenomenon is a Markov process, an

important simpliﬁcation can be made, as the n-point joint pdf,
Pn, is generated by the product of the conditional probabilities
p(ri+1, ti+1
1. A necessary condition
for a stochastic phenomenon to be a Markov process is the
Chapman-Kolmogorov (CK) equation, that:

is satisﬁed. Equation (6) should hold for any value of t′ in
the interval t2 < t′ < t1. One should check the validity of
the CK equation for different r1 by comparing the directly
evaluated conditional probability distributions p(r2, t2
r1, t1)
|
with the ones calculated according to right side of Eq. (6). The
simplest way to determine tM for stationary or homogeneous
data is the numerical calculation of the quantity,

for given r1 and r2, in terms of, for example, t′
t1 and
considering the possible errors in estimating S. Then, tM =

t1 for which S = 0. To ﬁnd q we
repeat the above procedure for volatility series.

ESTIMATION OF THE GARCH PARAMETERS

isandβ′

Based on what has mentioned, the difﬁculty of modeling
a GARCH sequence depends on both p and q and also on
how much return and volatility memories there are in the pro-
cess. Higher values of the α′
is parameters give rise to
more return and volatility memories and are therefore harder
to model accurately. Increasing the number of model param-
eters will also make the model more difﬁcult to model sim-
ply because there are more variables to numerically optimise.
This suggests the following order of difﬁculty GARCH(1,1),
GARCH(1,2), GARCH(2,2),...,etc. Our approach is based on
developing a new way for selecting proper p and q in GARCH
family models. Since, p and q appear in a recursion relation,
it seems that, they mean as the direct memory in return and
volatility series, respectively. Roughly speaking, they indicate
that how many steps in return and volatility series we need to
go back to get a good p and q. Additionally, Markov time scale
is the direct memory of the data, too. So, using Markov time
scale to get a proper enumeration for p and q in return and
volatility series, respectively, is reasonable. In this way, we
now apply the introduced new method to construct the ﬂuctu-
ations in the stock markets by calculating tM . For this pur-
pose, return (rt) and volatility (σt) series are constructed on
an asset or portfolio in ﬁrst step. Then, to ﬁnd tM , the validity
of the CK equation for different r1 is checked by compar-
ing the directly evaluated conditional probability distributions
r1, t1) with the ones calculated according to the right
p(r2, t2
|
(6). As we mentioned in the previous section,
side of Eq.

the simplest way to determine tM for data is the numerical
calculation of the quantity S that was introduced in eq. (7),
considering the possible errors in its estimation S. It should
be taken into account that, if S is less than statistical error, it
means S = 0 and the CK equation is valid. Calculation of
tM is achieved for various time intervals and ﬁnally, tM will
be equal to the minimum length scale which S = 0. Using
this approach, we have considered some time series related to
ﬁnancial markets and commodities. We have calculated their
Markov time scale both for returns and volatilities. Numerics
are presented in Table 1. Taking into account results, indicates
that Markov time scale of returns and volatilities for most of
such data is equal 1. This implies that GARCH (1,1) model
can be a well established model for ﬁnancial modeling and
descriptions.

We have known that the Markov time scales tM for the
daily return and volatility series are equal to one for majority
of ﬁnancial time series, therefore the standard GARCH(1,1)
model could well capture the most important features of these
kind of data in general. We have used above formalism for
some daily time series such as S&P 500 (20 October 1982 to
24 November 2004), Dowjones (4 January 1915 to 20 Febru-
ary 1990), NZSX (7 January 1980 to 30 December 1999).

The value of S on the Eq. (7) has been calculated for two
time series: returns and volatilities. In ﬁg. 1 the results of S
values related to daily closing prices of S&P 500 along with
their statistical errors for different time scales are shown.

The interesting point is that our calculations show that
Markov time scale for the daily return and volatility series in
brent oil prices (4 January 1982 to 23 April 2002) is q = 2
and p = 1, respectively. Moreover, Renner, Peinke and
Friedrich (2001) have shown that Markov time scale in returns
of the high frequency (minutely) US Doller - German Mark
exchange rates in the one-year period October 92 to Septem-
ber 93 is larger than 4 minutes.

CONCLUSION

In this paper, we introduced a new criterion to ﬁnd proper p
and q in GARCH family models. In summary, a fundamental
time scale in our approach is the Markov time scale tM , which
is the minimum time interval over which the data can be con-
sidered as constituting a Markov process. This criterion shows

that the standard GARCH (1,1) model works well for the ma-
jority of daily time series. Since, stock market is a complex
phenomenon, it is indeed possible to have dynamic memory
instead of static memory. On the other way, further data has a
dynamic relation to previous data. Alternatively, previous data
affect the probability of happening present data. The method
we proposed, is sensitive enough to detect abnormal varia-
tions of the Markov time scale for ﬁnding appropriate p and q.
Based upon our proposed approach, one is able to go further
and predict the dynamics of the parameters. The method is
quite general and is capable of explaining the complexity of
the stochastic phenomena without requiring any scaling fea-
ture.

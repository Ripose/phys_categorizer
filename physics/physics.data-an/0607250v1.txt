Abstract

A taxonomy of large ﬁnancial crashes proposed in the literature locates
the burst of speculative bubbles due to endogenous causes in the frame-
work of extreme stock market crashes, deﬁned as falls of market prices
that are outlier with respect to the bulk of drawdown price movement
distribution. This paper goes on deeper in the analysis providing a fur-
ther characterization of the rising part of such selected bubbles through
the examination of drawdown and maximum drawdown movement of in-
dices prices. The analysis of drawdown duration is also performed and it
is the core of the risk measure estimated here.

Key words Risk measure, drawdown, speculative bubbles.

1 Introduction

An insight in the long term behavior of portfolios is a delicate task in long term
investment strategies. The need to consider extreme ﬁnancial market events
encompasses the investigation of large ﬁnancial crashes, that were already clas-
siﬁed as outliers with respect to the bulk of market drops, and often associated
to the burst of speculative bubbles due to endogenous causes [1].
This paper aims at extracting risk features that characterize the rising part of
such speculative bubbles.

Our data selection relies on the huge data analyses worked out by Johansen
and Sornette [1, 2]. In their several papers, they develop and support through
empirical evidence the theory describing speculative bubbles due to endogenous
causes like as systems close to some rupture point. In particular large market

indices drops ending speculative bubbles due to endogenous causes have been
characterized through the occurrence of log-periodic-power laws (LPPL), in-
terpreted as a signature of underlying cooperative phenomena among market
agents. These results were related to analyses of drawdown movements of mar-
ket indices prices (DD), thus providing systematic taxonomy of crashes [1, 3, 4].
Our analysis starts from this point and goes on inquiring drawdown market
prices movements duration and size. The analysis of duration of drawdown
movement is relevant in itself, considering the key role of time in catastrophic
events like as large ﬁnancial crashes are, that show a drop of prices within short
time intervals [1, 2, 5]. The analysis of drawdown size requires as a preliminary
step the selection among the several diﬀerent deﬁnitions of drawdown that were
proposed in literature. Results depend strictly on the measure chosen for draw-
down, and on the actual data set [1, 5, 6, 7]. A ﬁrst analysis classiﬁed large
stock markets indices crashes as outliers whether considering the stretched ex-
ponential distribution of market drops [6]. A further analysis for noise ﬁltered
drawdowns allowed to calibrate parameter in order to avoid outliers [5]. Other
studies using diﬀerent deﬁnitions of drawdowns and considering diﬀerent data
sets proposed for returns drawdown probability density ﬁtting stable models [8],
the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) [7, 8], and the modiﬁed the general-
ized Pareto distribution (MGPD). The worst scenario of maximum draw down
movements (MDD) has also been examined. Results depend on the time window
on which the maximum is estimated. For example in [7] the time window selec-
tion corresponds approximately to half an year, the entire data sets cover more
than 20 years, and the results are used for probability distribution calibration.
In [8] rolling windows of 63 data each are used on datasets including at least 15
year. In both cases the long time series of market indices data that were used
include lower and bigger ﬁnancial crashes, the rise and the deﬂate of bubbles,
till to the return to fundamentals, and the several changes of regimes included
in societal and trading dynamics spanning the last 15-20 years. Therefore, the
maximum drawdown measure calculated on rolling windows gives samples of a
process obeying several diﬀerent dynamics. Here we aim at using a diﬀerent
approach for drawdown modeling.
Instead of splitting the entire time series
that are available, we extrapolate the probability of drawdown and maximum
drawdown during the rising part of the speculative bubble, looking for the ex-
traction of common features.
We compare the results obtained on the DD through the estimate of risk mea-
sures. Risk exposure in ﬁnancial markets has been described through several
measures (VaR, CVaR, etc.) based on statistical properties of data that do not
consider the order of data sequences. In fact empirical mean, variance, as well
as higher order moments of probability distributions are invariant under data
shuﬄe. But long downward trends containing long lasting sequences of con-
secutive drawdown price movements could suggest investors to withdraw from
the market, and they can quite force small investors to such a choice. There-
fore, measures of risk based both on the duration of consecutive market drops
and on the maximum drawdown can play a relevant role in driving investment
strategies.

2

We stress again that we use here a methodological approach deeply diﬀerent
form other comparative studies on risk measures, because we aim at extracting
features of periods (the rising part of speculative bubbles due to endogenous
causes), that are supposed to be driven by the same kind of dynamics, and we
proceed comparing them with the entire data set available, whilst other studies
that compare risk measures on long time windows don’t take into account the
evolution of dynamics driving stock markets across decades [8].

2 Large stock market indices crashes

A series of papers about speculative bubbles proposes an explanation of large
ﬁnancial crashes due to causes endogenous to the market. Similarities with
critical phenomena like earthquakes and the sound emission in materials close
to the rupture point led the research to the detection of cooperative underlying
phenomena evidenced through discrete scale invariance in ﬁnancial data (FX,
Gold, stock market indices) close to large crashes that can thus be well described
as critical points [2]. In the case of market indices the logarithm of index values
close to the crash time is described by the by a characteristic LPPL:

F (t) ≃ A + B(tc − t)m + C(tc − t)mcos(ωln(tc − t) − φ)

t < tc

(1)

where tc is the crash time, and A, B, C, m , ω, φ, and tc are parameters to be
estimated via numerical optimization. A further taxonomy that distinguishes
the causes that generate crashes can be found in [1] and conﬁrms the detection
of LPPL as a hallmark of speculative bubbles due to causes endogenous to the
market [1, 9, 10] cross-validated with the amplitude of the crash ending the
bubble as an outlier from probability distribution of the bulk of price variations
[4, 6]. Stock market indices datasets reported in Tab. 1 were selected lying
on the results of [1] in which the selection of an outlier market drop is used in
itself as a deﬁnition of crash and then it is cross-validated with the occurrence
of LPPL. The rising period of the bubble in which the LPPLs occur is selected
starting from a lowest point before the rise of the bubble and ending at the
maximum value of the index [2].

3 Drawdown duration distribution

The time plays a key role in crash deﬁnition [1, 2] and in the reaction of investors
to the change of market condition, but most attention up to now was paid to
the MDD than to the time in which it occurs, although the time measure was
proposed as a ﬁrst step towards the deﬁnition of some “drawdown velocity” [1].
Therefore, for each selected data sets we exploit the duration of drawdowns,
deﬁned in the most simple way as the number of time steps from a local peak
to the next local minimum, corresponding to the so called “pure” drawdowns
of [1, 2, 5].

3

A ﬁrst empirical result for drawdown duration is shown in [7], where the neg-
ative binomial or the Poisson distribution is proposed for modeling drawdown
duration, and the Gamma or Pareto distribution for modeling the maximum
drawdown.
Let {pt}t=1,T be a time series of a stock market index daily closure price, and
let rt = log(pt/pt−1) be the usual log-returns. The following deﬁnition is in
accord with the drawdown deﬁnition used in [7], apart from a normalization
factor that is not relevant for our analysis.
Deﬁnition Let pk be a local maximum, and pl be the next local minimum:

pk > pk+1 > · · · > pl, with l − k ≥ 1, k ≥ 1, and pk > pk−1, pl+1 > pl.

(2)

A pure DD (size) is deﬁned as the partial sum of daily returns

DDk,l =| rk+1 + rk+2 + · · · rl |=|

rk+j |=| log

(3)

l−k

X
j=1

pl
pk

|

The drawdown duration is the time length l − k of the sequence of negative
returns deﬁned through (2).
The drawdown duration exponent decay during the rising part collapse on
the interval α ≃ 1, α ∈ [0.46, 1.7], mean value approximately at 1 (Fig. 1),
whilst on the entire data set mean value approximately at α ≃ 0.94 (Fig. 2)
α ∈ [0.67, 1.10], accordingly to the presence of longer and deeper crashes in
the enlarged time domain. The Poisson distribution gives a poor ﬁt on the
lowest duration values, and no useful result comes from the negative binomial
ﬁt. Therefore, we are going to use the empirical estimates for the risk measure
computation.

Studies on speculative bubbles have attempted to extract common features
beyond LPPL. A ﬁrst attempt [7] to relate GARCH parameters with the pre-
diction of the volatility connected to the drawdown movement is made clearer
in [11]: the presence of a bubble drives the high volatility in the GARCH model,
but the reversal implication does not hold. The power law exponents of draw-
down duration decay seem to evidence some general feature of drawdown dura-
tion interestingly in itself.
The grouping of the exponents in a range supports the hypothesis of close risk
proﬁles across international markets, form the DD duration point of view. How-
ever, a further correlation analysis comparing the α extimated on each series and
the LPPL paramenters ω and z does not show signiﬁcative empirical correlation,
like at it was stated for GARCH parameters.

4 A measure of risk based on drawdown move-

ments size and duration

Stock market indices actually are a particular portfolio, basing on a weighted
mean of selected stock prices, and to buy/sell stock market indices has the

4

meaning to buy/sell a previous selected ﬁnancial product replica of the index
(Exchange Traded Funds (ETF), certiﬁcates). Portfolio risk measures consid-
ering DD and MDD should be used in a complementary way with respect to
the traditional ones (VaR, ES) at least in the case of Stable Paretian distribu-
tion [8]. This section aims at comparing the behavior of a risk measure based
on drawdown movement size on the rising part of speculative bubbles and on
the entire time series. Results of [1] that classify as outliers with respect to
the stretched exponential distribution the large ﬁnancial crahes rising from the
burst of speculative bubbles due to endogenous causes were extended considering
coarse-grained drawdowns (ǫ-drawdowns) [5], and later the GPD distribution for
negative tails was tested [7, 8, 12, 13]. These last results go beyond the mere
distribution hypothesis testing, relying on literature on extreme events, that
proposes the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD), as a universal description
of the tail of distributions of Peaks-Over-Thresholds. The same approach can be
used for the MDD estimates. Although the duration plays a key role in draw-
downs little or no analysis has been reported on the literature on drawdown
duration [7]. Therefore, we perform analyses on the joint probability of both
drawdown size and drawdown duration. The following measure of drawdowns

P r{DD < s} =

P r{DDk,l < s}P r{l − k = d}

(4)

∞

X
d=1

is estimated on the rising part of each selected bubble and on the entire time
series of the corresponding stock market index. This approach diﬀers from the
one used in [7, 12], that relies on probability obtained as a best ﬁt of empirical
drawdown size distribution, but that is based on independence hypothesis for
drawdown duration modeling.
The weight of the biggest crashes in the entire time series evidences in lowering
curves corresponding to entire time series.
Following the approach of [7] we ﬁt the GPD generalized Pareto distribution

Gξ,β(x) = 1 − (1 + ξ ∗ x/β)

, x ∈ D(ξ, β)

(5)

−1
ξ

on the set of (4) estimated on the rising part and on the set of entire time series
(Figs 3, 4). This result provides the mean behavior of drawdown to which refer
in case of speculative bubbles, and evidences the diﬀerence with respect to the
common behavior of the entire time series. On the rising part of the bubble
β = 0.0089(0.0085, 0.0093), ξ = 0.4273(0.3783, 0.4763); on the entire time series
β = 0.0153(0.0148, 0.0158), ξ = 0.3012(0.2698, 0.3326) The ranges of ξ and β
parameters are not overlapping. The change of parameters value gives also
another measure of large drops considered in the entire time series if compared
with the drops experienced during the bubble. For each selected bubble Fig. 5
shows the cumulative function (4) of both the rising part of the bubble and the
entire index. The closest the functions, the closest the drawdown structures are,
and the lowest the impact of the outlier, that implies also that minor crashes in
the rising part of the bubble have a relevant weight.

5 Maximum of drawdown movements

Other measures of drawdown behavior were considered, in the case of the oc-
currence of the worst scenario. P r{max(DD) < s} was calculated in [7] condi-
tioning to the duration, like in (4). The probability distribution of max(DD)
was extracted through a segmentation of 15-20 years long time series. This
procedure relies on the (undeclared) assumption that data in time windows
considered obey a homogeneous underlying process, that of course is a very
raw assumption. The need to split windows is due to the fact that only one
max(DD) is available for each time series, but several samplings are needed in
order to build a distribution. Here we follow ad deeply diﬀerent methodological
approach, aiming at extracting features that can be shared by the rising part
of speculative bubbles. Therefore we consider max(DDk,l) conditioned to the
duration and we estimate and compare

E[max(DD)] =

max{DDk,l | l − k = d}P r{l − k = d}

(6)

∞

X
d=1

on each time series. Results are shown in Figs 6 and 6. The leftmost picture
reports the results on the rising part of the bubble, the rightmost on the entire
time series. This estimate compares the size of maximum sequences of drops
inside with the ones outside the bubble, allowing to understand the impact of a
huge ﬁnancial crash with respect to the smaller crashes internal to the bubble.
E[max(DD)] ∈ (0.01, 0.08) (rising part) and E[max(DD)] ∈ (0.05, 0.13) (entire
series). Ranges are partially overlapping, remarking that some crashes classiﬁed
as huge in some indices had a magnitudo not so impressive for other indices.

Another measure that has been considered starts from a stochastic processes

approach [14]:
Deﬁnition Let {X(t)} a stochastic process the maximum drawdown ¯D is given
by

¯D = supt∈[0,T ](sups∈[0,t]X(s) − X(t)).

(7)

This measure gives the range from the maximum to the minimum anytime
the maximum precedes the minimum. ¯D was calculated using X(t) = log(pt).
Using this deﬁnition size of drawdowns of ¯D are higher of max(DD), due to the
weakening of the descent conditions, and provides a worse scenario. Fig. 6 shows
¯D ∈ (0.04, 0.17) rising part; ¯D ∈ (0.08, 0.35) on entire series. The weakening
of the descent conditions can also be addressed for the the higher overlap in
windows values. Anyway this measure is worth of being considered because it
gives the very worst loss case in case of long time buy-and-hold strategies.

6 Conclusions and further developements

This paper focuses on risk measures based on drawdowns and has introduced
the empirical estimate of duration in the loss function underlying a risk measure.
The analysis of the duration of drawdown is relevant for fund managers, that

6

can bear high volatility periods, but that risk to lose clients whether a large
sequence of drops happens. Empirical results are used to extract characteristics
common to the rising part of speculative bubbles and to evidence similarities
and diﬀerences with respect to the entire time series. The approach used here is
deeply far from the most common usage to split long time series or to simulate
them basing on the raw hypothesis of a homogeneous process underlying long
time series. Recently an alert system [11] was proposed in order to open the
way to practical usage of the LPPL bubble theory for the forecast of the bubble
ending time. We look forward for the embedding the present analysis into the
predictive scheme of [11] for the calibration of investment strategies during the
rising part of bubbles, before the expected crash time.

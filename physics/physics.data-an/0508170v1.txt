Abstract

In spite of precautions to avoid the harmful eﬀects of extreme events, we experience
recurrently phenomena that overcome the preventive barriers. These barriers usually
increase drastically right after the occurrence of such extreme events, but steadily
decay in their absence. In this paper we consider a simple model that mimics the
evolution of the protection barriers to study the eﬃciency of the system’s reaction
to extreme events and how it changes our perception of the sequence of extreme
events itself. We obtain that the usual method of ﬁghting extreme events introduces
a periodicity in their occurrence and is generally less eﬃcient than the use of a
constant barrier. On the other hand, it shows a good adaptation to the presence of
slow non-stationarities.

Key words: extreme events, recurrence time, adaptive model

1 Introduction

One important motivation for the uniﬁed study of extreme events is the con-
centration of the destructive power of diﬀerent systems in some few rare events.
Remarkable examples are earthquakes, extreme weather conditions, epileptic
seizures, heart attacks, stock markets crashes, etc... (1). Extreme events are
usually generated by complex dynamics that involves the coupling between
many diﬀerent dimensions and scales (2). However, the characterization of
extreme events is usually done in a single scientiﬁcally or socially relevant
observable, like the magnitude of earthquakes, number of days of drought, or
the highest wind speed in storms. From the point of view of dynamical sys-
tems, which is assumed throughout this paper, we say that these observables

are obtained applying an observation function to the full phase space of the
system.

In this paper we assume a general perspective for the inﬂuence of feedback
reactions to extreme events. These reactions may be consequence of human
activities or of natural feedback loops present in the system (3). For concrete-
ness we motivate the problem and we associate our mathematical model with
the case of human reactions to ﬂoods in rivers (4), which is a representative
example of the class of extreme events which we are interested in. The land
use of the surrounding area of a river is usually determined through a long
period of (non-scientiﬁc) observations. The most natural observable is the
maximum height of the water in a period (e.g., annual maxima), even though
observables like the drainage area or the discharge volume are also commonly
used in the scientiﬁc literature. After a long period of normality, i.e., when
the river does not overcome the standard preventive barriers, protection is
usually neglected, and the barriers inevitably assume a lower value. On the
opposite, after the occurrence of a ﬂood (extreme event) a lot of attention
and eﬀorts are directed to avoid similar catastrophes in the future and the
barriers thus increase. This is the most natural unplanned human reaction
to extreme events and will constitute the main motivation for the simpliﬁed
model analyzed in this paper. More subtle reactions may aﬀect the observable
used to characterize the system. For instance, excavations in the river and the
construction of new buildings and levees in the ﬂoodplains, which also depend
on the occurrence of recent ﬂoods, modify the available area of the river. In
this case, the measure of the water level is directly aﬀected by these human
activities and not only by the amount of water in the rivers basin. An even
more drastic human activity can change the dynamics of the system in the
phase space: the construction of a water reservoir upstream can directly con-
trol the level of the waters, or, more indirectly, the precipitation in a region is
inﬂuenced by the presence of strong human activity.

In summary, the human activities act in a kind of feedback loop with the
occurrence of extreme events and can in principle inﬂuence three diﬀerent
levels on the measurement chain:

(I1) The preventive barriers, e.g., by increasing the protections around the river.
(I2) The observable used to characterize the system, e.g., by digging the river.
(I3) The dynamics in the phase space in a more fundamental way, e.g., by con-

structing water reservoirs.

The reactions to extreme events may be planned or involuntary and, corre-
spondingly, the two fundamental questions are:

(Q1) Which is the best method in order to reduce the number of extreme events?
(Q2) Which is the inﬂuence of the feedback reactions on our perception and on

2

the occurrence of extreme events?

This paper address questions (Q1) and (Q2) through the analysis of a simple
stochastic model that simulates the feedback reactions (I1) and (I2). It is orga-
nized as follows. In Sec. 2 we present the model. The time between successive
extreme events is studied in Sec. 3 and the eﬃciency of the model in Sec. 4.
In Sec. 5 we discuss how our model adapts to the eﬀect of non-stationarities.
Finally, we summarize our conclusions in Sec. 6.

2 Moving threshold model

We consider here a simpliﬁed model for the feedback reactions to extreme
events that takes into account the main features discussed in the previous sec-
tion. A random sequence of events ξn is taken as a stochastic input to our model
and represent the complex phenomenon measured in the physically relevant
observable. We say that an extreme event occurs at time n when ξn overcomes
the value of the barrier qn, i.e., ξn > qn. In this case we expect the new value
of the barrier qn+1 to be increased proportionally to the extreme value ξn. On
the other hand, if no extreme event occurs in time n, the barriers decrease to
a fraction of its previous value. This decay of the barriers occurs typically due
to the short memory underlying the human activities (forgetting), but it can
also appear naturally, e.g., the decay of immunity after vaccination (5), or the
increasing vulnerability of forest to wind gusts due to the growth of trees. The
change of the barrier size qn+1 can be thus summarized as

qn+1 = 


where formally 0 < β < 1 and α > 0. The max in the ﬁrst equation can as-
sume the value βqn only for α < β, and is introduced in the model to avoid the
artiﬁcial reduction of the barrier after an extreme event. We study the tem-
poral sequence of extreme events as a function of the control parameters α, β,
with special interest for the cases β / 1 and α ' 1, which means that an
event of the size of the last extreme should not overcome the threshold in the
(near) future. In principle the dynamics deﬁned by Eq. (1) can be applied to
that does not contain the inﬂuence of human activities.

It is interesting to compare this model to other simple stochastic models used

and paradigmatic examples of stochastic resonance (8). The novel aspect of
the model studied in this paper is the existence of a threshold that varies
deterministically in time depending only on the previous extreme events.

It is sometimes convenient to study the dynamics of Eq. (1) using the variable

We would like at this point to associate explicitely our model with the per-
spective of ﬂoods in rivers mentioned before. Considering the original vari-
ables (ξ, q), we regard the human inﬂuence restricted to the delimitation of
the river domain. In this case ξ could be the water level and q the size of
the preventive barrier, measured as the maximum acceptable height of the
water before causing damage. On the other hand, if we perform the change
of variable (2), we interpret y as the departure of the water level from this
threshold (y < 0 below and y > 0 above threshold), while ξ as the water in
the river basin and q as a measure of the modiﬁcation of the river shape due
to human activity. We see thus that the dynamics deﬁned by Eq. (1) models
simultaneously reactions (I1) and (I2) mentioned in the introduction.

form of ρ(y). In this case the knowledge of
, σy (see also Eq. (3)) uniquely
determines the fraction of extreme events ρ(y > 0). Increasing α we notice
an increase of σq and σy. For large α, the distribution ρ(q) becomes highly
asymmetric and a long tail for large q′s appears. In this case ρ(y) also loses
its normal form.

3 Interval between extreme events

One of the most important characteristics of the temporal sequence of extreme
events is their recurrence time (9), i.e., the time T between two successive ex-
treme events quantiﬁed by the interevent time distribution P (T ). Using a
constant barrier qn = q the extreme events obtained from an uncorrelated
random time series occur also completely at random and P (T ) decays expo-
nentially. We show in this section that this is not the case when the size of the
barrier dynamically changes according to Eq.(1). In this case P (T ) presents
typically a maximum, i.e., there is a characteristic interevent time Tmax > 0.

To compute P (T ), i.e., the probability of having two consecutive extreme
events separated by time T , we ﬁrst have to calculate the probability r(t) of
having one extreme event at time t independent of the other events. In our

given by

where erfc(x) is the complementary error function. During the interval between
extreme events the barrier evolves as qt = αξ−βt. The value ξ− determines q0 =
αξ− and corresponds to the value of ξn that generated the previous extreme
event, or, in the exceptional case when ξn > qn but βqn > αξn [see Eq. (1)], to
ξ− = βqn/α. Due to the lack of further correlations between extreme events,
the interevent time distribution P (T ) is obtained as the composition of the
probability of having an extreme event at time T with the probability that no
event occurred for t = [0, T [, which can be written as

Eq. (6) the constant value ξ− =

tions are plotted in Fig. 2 where we notice the existence of a nontrivial most
probable interevent time Tmax, in good agreement with the numerical results.
This constitutes the main and at ﬁrst sight most striking result, i.e., extreme
events occur almost periodically if α > 1.

The existence of such a most probable interevent interval Tmax resembles re-
sults obtained in models presenting stochastic resonance (8) or coherence res-
onance (12). However, this is not the case of our model since it has neither a
periodic input signal nor a resonance behavior for diﬀerent noise amplitudes.
In fact, in our case Tmax varies with the control parameters α, β, whereas a
modiﬁed (constant in time) variance of ξn is equivalent to a simple rescaling of
the length scale and do not aﬀect time scales. We would like to obtain now the

knowledge of the distribution of ξ−, which also strongly depends on α, β. For-
tunately some intuition can be gained through simple approaches developed
in what follows. Qualitatively, we notice that the existence of a most probable
interevent time is a consequence of the reduction of the probability of short in-
terevent times due to the increment of the barrier size after one extreme event.

4 Eﬃciency of the model

The most relevant issue in the socio-economic context is how to minimize the
number of extreme events, or how to optimize the eﬃciency of a protection
strategy. The rate of extreme events ρ(y) > 0 is the simplest and most natural
measure of the costs due to extreme events and is thus used throughout this
paper. For many situations it is a realistic measurement of the damage that
occur due to the overpass of a threshold (e.g, obstruction of a street or of
the power supply), where there is no diﬀerence between ”small” and ”large”
extreme events. In other situations, more detailed accounts of the costs would
make use of cost functions that depend (non-linearly) on y. Our model can be
considered as a speciﬁc method which can be optimized by the choice of the
control parameters α, β.

The rate of extreme events ρ(y > 0) as a function of the control parameters
is shown in Fig. 4. Since the barrier q do not necessarily increase after one
extreme event if α < 1, we notice again a qualitatively diﬀerent behavior
for α < 1 and α > 1. For a ﬁxed β and varying α (Fig. 4a) we notice that
the number of extreme events decays drastically around α
1. On the other
hand, by ﬁxing α and varying β (Fig. 4b) the number of extreme events goes
much faster to zero when β

1 if α > 1.

≈

→

It is quite natural that the number of extreme events is reduced when the con-
trol parameters increase. However, in real situations the increment of these
parameters, or equivalently the increment of the barrier, is related to some
costs that have to be taken into account when studying the eﬃciency of the
model. Since the costs are usually increasing with the size of the barrier, we
. In Fig. 5 the rate of
measure them by the mean value of the barriers
extreme events is shown against
for diﬀerent values of the control param-
eters α, β and is compared with the result (dotted line) obtained when the
barrier is maintained unchanged in time. As already suggested in Eq. (3), we
notice that our moving threshold method is always less eﬃcient than the con-
stant barrier case. The limit of unchanged barrier is obtained in our model
for α
1, when the most eﬃcient results are obtained. By noting
that the lines of constant α are approximately parallel to this limit, we realize
that the relevant limit is β
1 an eﬃcient reduction
of the number of extreme events is only possible by increasing β towards one.

than maintaining the size of the barrier constant in time, i.e., a non-reactive
model. On the other hand, a clear advantage of reactive models is their ability
to deal with non-stationarities in the time series. This is a specially important
issue when considering extreme events since in many cases they are indeed
originated from process presenting slow trends. Once more, these trends may
be natural or consequence of human activities (e.g., change in land use, global
warming).

In order to explore how the model deﬁned by Eq. (1) adapts to weak non-
stationarities, we choose in this section the input time series

Since the barrier increases proportionally to the size of the extreme event, we
see that the time our model takes to adjust to non-stationarities is given by
the interevent time T . When Tmax is much smaller than the total observation
time, as considered here, the non-stationary eﬀects can be considered small
during this time interval. As a consequence of this fast adaptability of our

model to the application of relations (7) we have that the dependence of the
number of extreme events on the parameters α, β is qualitatively equivalent
to the one reported in Sec. 4 for the stationary case. In order to obtain the
eﬃciency we have to compare again the extreme events rate ρ(y > 0) with
(costs). However, now the value of q is driven by changes

eﬃciency analysis does not make sense in this case. More interesting is the case
when the variance σξ changes in time and the mean value
is kept constant,
shown in Fig. 7 for both increasing and decreasing σξ. The comparison with
the results obtained with constant barrier shows that with reasonable choice
of parameters α, β the moving threshold model leads to a much more eﬃcient
result.

In summary, we have introduced a model to simulate human reactions or natu-
ral feedback response to extreme events. We have obtained that the sequence of
extreme events occur with a certain periodicity, exclusively due to the human
activity (natural feedback). Regarding the eﬃciency of the model, we have
obtained that the best strategy in order to eﬃciently reduce the number of
extreme events is to try to avoid the decrease of the protection barriers in the
periods between extreme events. On the other hand, if slow non-stationarities
are present in the phenomena, it is also useful to increase the usual protec-
tions to the value of the previous extreme event. The same conclusion is also
expected for positively correlated sequences of events.

These results are obtained in a very simpliﬁed model that tries to isolate the
inﬂuence of the human reactions to extreme events. In more realistic setups the
properties discussed here may appear together with system-speciﬁc character-
istics. In this sense, we can relate the characteristic interevent time observed

13

in our model with the observed interepidemic interval between, e.g., small-
pox epidemics (13). Direct association of realistic preventive schemes with the
control parameters of our model lead to the estimation of the characteristic
interevent time. For instance, in the example of ﬂoods in river we may esti-
mate that barriers are reduced by 2% every year and that after a ﬂood they
are increased by 20% more than the highest water level. With these parame-
ters and ignoring deviations of Gaussianity, we obtain through our model the
reasonable estimation of a 53 years period between ﬂoods.

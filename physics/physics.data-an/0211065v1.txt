The lognormal distribution describing, e.g., exponentials of Gaussian random variables is one of
the most common statistical distributions in physics. It can exhibit features of broad distributions
that imply qualitative departure from the usual statistical scaling associated to narrow distributions.
Approximate formulae are derived for the typical sums of lognormal random variables. The validity
of these formulae is numerically checked and the physical consequences, e.g., for the current ﬂowing
through small tunnel junctions, are pointed out.

INTRODUCTION: PHYSICS MOTIVATION

Most usual phenomena present a well deﬁned aver-
age behaviour with ﬂuctuations around the average val-
ues. Such ﬂuctuations are described by narrow (or ’light-
tailed’) distributions like, e.g., Gaussian or exponential
distributions. Conversely, for other phenomena, ﬂuctu-
ations themselves dictate the main features, while the
average values become either irrelevant or even non exis-
tent. Such ﬂuctuations are described by broad (or ’heavy-
tailed’) distributions like, e.g., distributions with power
law tails generating ’L´evy ﬂights’. After a long period
in which the narrow distributions have had the quasi-
monopoly of probability applications, it has been realized
in the last ﬁfteen years that broad distributions arise in
a number of physical systems [1, 2, 3].

Macroscopic physical quantities often appear as the

sums Sn of microscopic quantities xi:

Sn =

xi,

n

i=1
X

(1)

where x1, x2, . . . , xn are independent and identically dis-
tributed random variables. The dependence of such sums
Sn with the number n of terms epitomizes the role of the
broadness of probability distributions of xi’s. One intu-
itively expects the typical sum St

n to be given by:

n

is the average value of x. The validity of eq. (2)
where
is guaranteed at large n by the law of large numbers.
However, the law of large numbers is only valid for suf-
ﬁciently narrow distributions. Indeed, for broad distri-
butions, the sums Sn can strongly deviate from eq. (2).
For instance, if the distribution of the xi’s has a power
1/x1+α with 0 < α < 1
law tail (cf. L´evy ﬂights, [1]),
(
), then the typical sum of n terms is not pro-
x

portional to the number of terms but is given by:

∞

=

∝

St
n ∝

n1/α.

Physically, eq. (2) (narrow distributions) and eq. (3)
(L´evy ﬂights) correspond to diﬀerent scaling behaviours.

For the L´evy ﬂight case, the violation of the law of large
numbers occurs for any n. On the other hand, for other
broad distributions like the lognormal treated hereafter,
there is a violation of the law of large numbers only for
ﬁnite, yet surprisingly large, n’s.

These violations of the law of large numbers, whatever
their extent, correspond physically to anomalous scaling
behaviours as compared to those generated by narrow
distributions. This applies in particular to small tun-
nel junctions, such as the metal-insulator-metal junctions
currently studied for spin electronics [4, 5]. It has indeed
been shown, theoretically [6] and experimentally [7, 8],
that these junctions tend to exhibit a broad distribu-
tion of tunnel currents that generates an anomalous scal-
ing law: the typical integrated current ﬂowing through a
junction is not proportional to the area of the junction.
This is more than just a theoretical issue since this devi-
ation from the law of large numbers is most pronounced
[7, 9] for submicronic junction sizes relevant for spin elec-
tronics applications.

A similar issue is topical for the future development of
metal oxide semiconductor ﬁeld eﬀect transistors (MOS-
FETs). Indeed, the downsizing of MOSFETs requires a
reduction of the thickness of the gate oxide layer. This
implies that tunnelling through the gate becomes non
negligible[10, 11], generating an unwanted current leak-
age. Moreover, as in metal-insulator-metal junctions, the
large ﬂuctuations of tunnel currents may give rise to seri-
ous irreproducibility issues. Our model permits a statis-
tical description of tunnelling through non ideal barriers
applying equally to metal-insulator-metal junctions and
to MOSFET current leakages. Thus, anomalous scaling
eﬀects are expected to arise also in MOSFETs.

The current ﬂuctuations in tunnel junctions are well

described by a lognormal probability density [7, 12]

depending on two parameters, µ and σ2. The lognor-
mal distribution presents at the same time features of a
narrow distribution, like the ﬁniteness of all moments,

and features of a broad distribution, like a tail that can
extend over several decades.
It is actually one of the
most common statistical distributions and appears fre-
in biology [13] and ﬁnance [14]
quently, for instance,
(for review see [15, 16]).
In physics, it is often found
in transport through disordered systems such as wave
propagation in random media (radar scattering, mobile
phones,...)[17, 18].

In this paper, our aim is to obtain analytical expres-
sions for the dependence on the number n of terms of
the typical sums St
n of identically distributed lognormal
random variables. The theory must treat the n and σ2
ranges relevant for applications. For tunnel junctions,

both small n
1013 corresponding to millimet-
tions [12] and large n
ric sized junctions, and both small σ2
0.1 and large
σ2
10 [7, 19, 20, 21] have been studied experimentally.
For electromagnetic propagation in random media, σ2 is
typically in the range 2 to 10 [18].

There exist recent mathematical studies on sums of
lognormal random variables [22, 23] that are motivated
by glass physics (Random Energy Model). However,
these studies apply to regimes of large n and/or large
σ2 that do not correspond to those relevant for our prob-
lems. Our work concentrates on the deviation of the typ-
ical sum of a moderate number of lognormal terms with
σ2 . 15 from the asymptotic behaviour dictated by the
law of large numbers. Thus, this paper and [22, 23] treat
complementary
ranges.

Section II is a short review of the basic properties of
lognormal distributions, insisting on their broad char-
acter. Section III presents qualitatively the sums of n
lognormal random variables. Section IV introduces the
strategies used to estimate the typical sum St
n. Section V,
the core of this work, derives approximate analytical ex-
n for diﬀerent σ2-ranges. Section VI dis-
pressions of St
cusses the range of validity of the obtained results. Sec-
tion VII presents the striking scaling behaviour of the
sample mean inverse. Section VIII contains a summariz-
ing table and an overview of main results.

As the paper is written primarily for practitioners
of quantum tunnelling, it reintroduces in simple terms
the needed statistical notions about broad distributions.
However, most of the paper is not speciﬁc to quantum
tunnelling and its results may be applied to any problem
with sums of lognormal random variables. The adequacy
of the presented theory to describe experiments on tunnel
junctions is presented in [9].

II. THE LOGNORMAL DISTRIBUTION:
SIMPLE PROPERTIES AND NARROW VS
BROAD CHARACTER

In this section, we present simple properties (genesis,
characteristics, broad character) of the lognormal distri-
bution that will be used in the next sections.

Among many mechanisms that generate lognormal dis-

tributions [15, 16], two of them are especially important
in physics. In the ﬁrst generation mechanism, we con-
sider x as exponentially dependent on a Gaussian random
variable y with mean µy and variance σ2
y:

x = x0ey/y0

where x0 and y0 are scale parameters for x and y, respec-
tively. The probability density of y is:

A typical example of such a generation mechanism is pro-
vided by tunnel junctions. Indeed, the exponential cur-
rent dependence on the potential barrier parameters op-
erates as a kind of ’ﬂuctuation ampliﬁer’ by non-linearly
transforming small Gaussian ﬂuctuations of the param-
eters into qualitatively large current ﬂuctuations. This
implies, as seen above, lognormal distribution of tunnel
currents [9].

In the second generation mechanism, we consider the

product xn =
dom variables y1,

tends, at large n, to a Gaussian random variable of mean
2, according to the central limit the-
nµ′ and variance nσ′
orem. Hence, using eqs. (7a) and (7b) with x0 = y0 = 1,
xn is lognormally distributed with parameters µ = nµ′
and σ2 = nσ′

2.

The lognormal distribution given by eq. (4) has the

following characteristics.

The two parameters µ and σ2 are, according to eq. (7a)
and eq. (7b) with x0 = y0 = 1, the mean and the variance
of the Gaussian random variable ln x. The parameter µ
is a scale parameter. Indeed, if x is distributed according
to LN(µ, σ2)(x), then x′ = αx is distributed according
2 = σ2)(x′), as can be seen from
to LN(µ′ = µ + ln α, σ′
eq. (5), eq. (7a) and eq. (7b). Thus, one can always take
µ = 0 using a suitable choice of units. On the other hand,
σ2 is the shape parameter of the lognormal distribution.
The typical value xt, corresponding to the maximum

of the distribution, is

Figure 1 shows examples of lognormal distributions

row (rapidly decaying tail) and can be approximated

Another way of characterizing the broadness of a dis-
tribution, is to deﬁne an interval containing a certain

within [xm/eσ, xm
depends linearly on σ for the Gaussian and exponentially
for the lognormal.

Moreover, the weighted distribution xf (x), giving the
distribution of the contribution to the mean, is peaked
on the median xm. In the vicinity of xm one has[24]:

eµ+√2σ.

(14)

Thus, f (x) behaves as a distribution that is extremely
broad (1/x is not even normalizable) in an x-interval
whose size increases exponentially fast with σ and that
is smoothly truncated outside this interval.

Three diﬀerent regimes of broadness can be deﬁned
using the peculiar dependence of the probability peak
height f (xt) on σ2. Indeed, the use of eq. (4) and eq. (9)
yields:

f (xt) =

eσ2/2
√2πeµσ

For σ2

var (x) as

p
var (x) is the usual behaviour for a narrow dis-
width
tribution that concentrates most of the probability into
p
the peak.

When the shape parameter σ2 increases, still keep-

var (x), however it still decreases, as expected for a dis-
tribution that becomes broader and thus less peaked (see,

in ﬁgure 1, the diﬀerence between σ = 0.1 and σ = 1).

≤

On the contrary, when σ2 > 1, the peak height in-
creases with σ2 even though the distribution becomes
broader (see, in ﬁgure 1, the diﬀerence between σ = 1
and σ = 1.5). This is more unusual. The behaviour
of the peak can be understood from the genesis of
the lognormal variable x = ey with y distributed as
(y). When σ2 becomes larger, the

creases, yielding many x values much smaller than eµ,
all packed close to 0. This creates a narrow and high
peak for f (x).

This non monotonous variation of the probability peak
f (xt) with the shape parameter σ2 with a minimum in
σ2 = 1, incites to consider three qualitative classes of
lognormal distributions, that will be used in the next sec-
tions. The class σ2
1 corresponds to the narrow log-
normal distributions that are approximately Gaussian.
The class σ2 . 1 contains the moderately broad log-
normal distributions that may deviate signiﬁcantly from
Gaussians, yet retaining some features of narrow distri-
butions. The class σ2
1 contains the very broad log-
normal distributions.

III. QUALITATIVE BEHAVIOUR OF THE
TYPICAL SUM OF LOGNORMAL RANDOM
VARIABLES

In this section we explain the qualitative behaviour of
the typical sum of lognormal random variables by relating
it to the behaviours of narrow and broad distributions.
Consider ﬁrst a narrow distribution fN(x) presenting
a well deﬁned narrow peak concentrating most of the
probability in the vicinity of the mean
and with light
tails decaying suﬃciently rapidly away from the peak (ﬁg-
ure 2a). Draw, for example, three random numbers x1,
x2 and x3 according to the distribution fN(x). If fN(x)
is suﬃciently narrow, then x1, x2 and x3 will all be ap-
proximately equal to each other and to the mean
and
thus,

Note that no single term xi dominates the sum S3. More
generally, the sum of n terms will be close, even for small
n’s, to the large n expression given by the law of large
numbers:

(17)

Sn ≃

.

Consider now a broad distribution fB(x) whose proba-
bility spreads throughout a long tail extending over sev-
eral decades (ﬁgure 2b; note the logarithmic x-scale) in-
stead of being concentrated into a peak. Drawing three
random numbers according to fB(x),
it is very likely
that one of these numbers, for example x2, will be large
enough, compared to the other ones, to dominate the
sum S3:

S3 = x1 + x2 + x3 ≃

max(x1, x2, x3) = x2.

(18)

More generally, the largest term Mn,
Mn ≡

max(x1, . . . , xn),

will dominate the sum of n terms:

Sn ≃

Mn.

Under these premises, what is the order of magnitude
of Sn? To approximately estimate it, one can divide the
) of possible values of x [33] into n intervals
interval [0;
[a1 = 0; a2), [a2; a3), ..., [an; an+1 =
) corresponding
to a probability of 1/n:

fB(x) dx .

(21)

Intuitively, there is typically one random number xi in
each interval [aj; aj+1). The largest number Mn is thus
very likely to lie in the rightmost interval [an;
). The
most probable number in this interval is an (we assume
that fB(x) is decreasing at large x). Thus, applying
eq. (20) the sum Sn is approximately given by:

and with 0 < α < 1.

(23)
In this case, the sum Sn is called a ’L´evy ﬂight’. The
relation (22) yields[34] M t
x0n1/α and thus, using
n ≃
eq. (20),

St
n ≃

x0n1/α.

(24)

Note that, as α < 1, the average value is inﬁnite and thus
the law of large numbers does not apply here.

The fact that the sum Sn of n terms increases typi-
cally faster in eq. (24) than the number n of terms is in
contrast with the law of large numbers. This ’anomalous’
behaviour can be intuitively explained (see also ﬁgure 3 in
[9] for a complementary approach). Each draw of a new
random number from a broad distribution fB(x) gives
the opportunity to obtain a large number, very far in the
tail, that will dominate the sum Sn and will push it to-
wards signiﬁcantly larger values. Conversely, for narrow

n ≫

distributions fN(x), the typical largest term M t
n increases
very slowly with the number of terms (e.g., as √ln n for
a Gaussian distribution and as ln n for an exponential
distribution; see, e.g., [25]), whilst the typical sum St
n
increases linearly with n and thus St

M t
n.

The question that arises now is whether the sum of
lognormal random variables behaves like a narrow or
like a broad distribution. On one hand, the lognormal
distribution has ﬁnite moments, like a narrow distribu-
tion. Therefore, the law of large numbers must apply
at least for an asymptotically large number of terms:
. On the other hand, if σ2 is suﬃciently
x
Sn →n
i
h
large, the lognormal tail extends over several decades, as
for a broad distribution (see Section II). Therefore, the
sum of n terms is expected to be dominated by a small
number of terms, if n is not too large[35].

The domination of the sum by the largest terms can be

Figure 3 shows a plot of pq vs q for various σ’s. For
small σ’s (σ . 0.25), one has pq ≃

behaviour of a narrow distribution. For larger σ’s, one

behaviour of a broad distribution. Monte Carlo simula-
tions of tunnelling through MOSFET gates yield pq vs q

to a barrier thickness standard deviation of σd = 0.18 nm,

a barrier penetration length λ

In summary, if σ2 is small, the sum of n lognormal
terms is expected to behave like sums of narrowly dis-
tributed random variables, for any n. Conversely, if σ2
is suﬃciently large, the sum of n lognormal terms is ex-
pected to behave, at small n, like sums of broadly dis-
tributed random variables and, at large n, like sums of
narrowly distributed random variables (law of large num-
bers). Before converging to the law of large numbers
asymptotics, the typical sum may deviate strongly from
this law. Moreover, if this convergence is slow enough,
physically relevant problems may lie in the non converged
regime. This is indeed the case of submicronic tunnel
junctions [7].

In this section, we discuss strategies for obtaining the
n of lognormal random variables depending

typical sum St
on the value of the shape parameter σ2.

By deﬁnition St

n is the peak position of the distribu-
tion of Sn. Moreover, the latter is the n-fold convolu-
tion of f (x) and is denoted as f n
∗(Sn). As no exact
analytical expression is known for f n
∗ when f is lognor-
mal, one will turn to approximation strategies. These
strategies can be derived from the schematic represen-
tation, in the space of distributions, of the trajectory
followed by f n
∗ with increasing n (ﬁgure 4). The set of
lognormal distributions can be represented by an open
half-plane (µ, σ2) with µ
) and σ2
(0;
).
∞
In this half-plane, the shaded region with σ2
1 cor-
responds to quasi-Gaussian lognormal distributions (see
Appendix A). The whole lognormal half-plane is embed-
ded in the inﬁnite dimension space of probability distri-
butions, which is schematically represented in ﬁgure 4 as
a three dimension space.

for the law of large numbers to apply. We analyze now
more precisely the small n and large n behaviours.

For n = 1, eq. (35) gives St

decreases slowly with n, as 1/n, and might be measur-
able even for a relatively large n[42]. Thus, macroscopic
measurements may give access to microscopic ﬂuctua-
tions, which is important for physics applications. Usu-
ally, microscopic ﬂuctuations average out so that they
can not easily be extracted from macroscopic measure-
ments. This property, often taken for granted, comes
from the fast convergence of sums Sn to the law of large
numbers asymptotics, which only occurs with narrow dis-
tributions.

We consider now the peak height gn(Y t

A simple study, for the non trivial case σ2 > 1/2, reveals
p
that gn(Y t
n) decreases from n = 1 to n = C2/(e1/2
1)
(> 1) and then increases for larger values of n. This
echoes the non-monotonous dependence on σ2 of the peak
height of a lognormal distribution f (see eq. (15) and re-
lated comments). The increase at large n simply corre-
sponds to the narrowing of the distribution of Yn = Sn/n
when n increases, as predicted by the law of large num-
bers. Moreover, the large n expansion of eq. (41) gives
gn(Y t
n)
, which is the prediction of the central
limit theorem, as it should be. On the other hand, the
decrease of gn(Y t
n) at small n is less usual. The peak
of gn(Yn) is actually broader than the one of the un-
convoluted distribution g1 = f . This behaviour can be
understood in the following way. If the lognormal dis-
tribution f (x) is large enough (C2
1), it presents at
the same time a high and narrow peak at small x and
a long tail at large x. The eﬀect of convoluting f with
itself is ﬁrst (n < C2/(e1/2
1)) to ‘contaminate’ the
peak with the (heavy) tail. This results in a broadening
and decrease of the f n
∗(Sn) peak which is strong enough
to entail a decrease of the gn(Yn) = nf n
∗(Sn) peak. On
the contrary, when enough convolutions have taken place
(n > C2/(e1/2
n (eq. (32))
−
becomes small and the tail of f n
∗ becomes light. Under
these circumstances, further convolution mainly ‘mixes’
the peak with itself. This results in a broadening and
decrease of the f n
∗(Sn) peak which is weak enough to
allow an increase of the gn(Yn) = nf n

1)), the shape parameter σ2

∗(Sn) peak.

−

The small n decrease of gn(Yn) has physical conse-
quences. There is a range of sample sizes, corresponding
to n < C2/(e1/2
1) for which the precise determina-
tion of the typical values becomes more diﬃcult when
the sample size increases. This is a striking eﬀect of the
broad character of the lognormal distribution[43]. On the
contrary, for narrow distributions, the determination of
the typical value becomes more accurate as the sample
size increases.

At last, we examine the compatibility of the obtained
∗ with the central limit theorem by studying the distri-

consistently with the strategy deﬁned in Section IV (see

ation appears in eq. (44) as the convergence scale of f n

to the central limit theorem. As shown in eq. (35), C2
is also the convergence scale of St
n to the law of large

C. Case of very broad lognormal distributions

We consider here the case σ2

1 of very broad log-
normal distributions. To treat this complex case, we will
proceed through diﬀerent steps, in a more heuristic way
than in the previous cases.

≫

The ﬁrst step is to assume that the sums Sn are typi-
cally dominated by the largest term Mn, if n is not too
large (see eq. (20) and Section III) [45]. Thus, the dis-
tribution function of Sn, deﬁned as the probability that
Sn < x and denoted as Pr (Sn < x), is approximately
equal to the distribution function of Mn, denoted as
Pr (Mn < x):

σ2

≫

1 : Pr (Sn < x)

Pr (Mn < x) .

(46)

≃

As Mn is the largest term of all xi’s, Mn < x is equivalent
to xi < x for all i = 1, . . . , n. Thus,

Pr (Mn < x) = Pr (x1 < x)

where F (x)
the initial lognormal distribution. This implies

Pr (xn < x) = [F (x)]n

For n = 1 this expression is exact. When n increases
till n = σ2, eq. (50) gives an unusually fast, exponential
dependence on n that is in contrast with, e.g., the n5/2
dependence obtained for σ2 . 1 and n
C2 (eq. (36)).
Unfortunately, when n becomes larger, eq. (50) is qual-
itatively wrong. Indeed, it implies St

VII. A STRIKING EFFECT: SCALING OF THE
SAMPLE MEAN AND OF ITS INVERSE

×

In electronics, it is customary to study the product
A of the device resistance R by the device size A.
R
One usually checks that R
A does not depend on A,
×
otherwise this dependence is taken as the indication of
edge eﬀects.

What do the results presented in this paper imply for
the typical value of R
A? The resistance R being the
inverse of the conductance can be represented by 1/Sn
where Sn is the sum of n independent lognormally dis-
tributed conductances. The size A of the system is pro-
portional to n. Hence, one has:

×

(59)

where Yn is the sample mean of conductances. We have
shown that the typical sample mean increases with the
sample size (see eqs. (54)), if conductances are lognor-
mally distributed. Hence, one naively expects a decrease
of the typical value of R

A with A.

Let us do the correct calculation in the case σ2 .

Thus just as Y t

This counterintuitive result epitomizes the paradoxical
behaviour of some broad distributions. Moreover, this
can be a possible explanation for the anomalous scaling

[29].

VIII. CONCLUSION

We have studied the typical sums of n lognormal ran-
dom variables. Approximate formulae have been ob-
tained for three diﬀerent regimes of the shape parameter
σ2. Table I summarizes these results with their ranges of
applicability. These results are relevant up to σ . 4; for

larger σ, one may apply the theorems in [22] and [23].

The anomalous behaviour of the typical sums has been
related to the broadness of lognormal distributions. For
large enough shape parameter σ2, the behaviour of log-
normal sums is non trivial. It reveals properties of broad
distributions at small sample sizes and properties of nar-
row distributions at large sample sizes with a slow tran-
sition between the two regimes. Counter-intuitive eﬀects
have been pointed out like the decrease of the peak height
of the sample mean distribution with the sample size and
the fact that the typical sample mean and its inverse do
not vary with the sample size in opposite ways. Finally,
we have shown that the statistical eﬀects arising from
the broadness of lognormal distributions have observable
consequences for moderate size physical systems.

APPENDIX A: APPROXIMATION OF NARROW
LOGNORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS BY NORMAL
DISTRIBUTIONS AND VICE VERSA

As seen in Section II, the lognormal probability dis-
tribution f (x) = LN(µ, σ2)(x) is mostly concentrated in
the interval [eµe−
1, this range is small
and can be rewritten as:

σ, eµeσ]. If σ

Thus it makes sense to expand f (x) around its typical
value eµ by introducing a new random variable ǫ deﬁned
by:

[47] Standard numerical integration techniques to estimate
the n-fold convolution of f are impractical for broad dis-
tributions. On the contrary, the Monte Carlo scheme can
naturally handle the coexistence of small and large num-
bers [6].

log / log representation.

This expression is close to eq. (24), which consolidates
the intuitive reasoning based on eq. (22) to derive M t
n.
[35] This is distinct from the subexponential property. The
subexponentiality of the lognormal distribution [31] en-
sures that asymptotically large sums Sn are dominated
by the largest term, for any n. Here on the contrary, we
are interested in the domination of the typical sum, which
is by deﬁnition not asymptotically large, by the largest
term, a property that is only valid for a limited n range.
[36] The expressions of pq and q given by eq. (25) and eq. (26)
are meaningful for very large statistical samples, as they
correspond to average quantities. For small samples, sta-
tistically, pq and q might deviate signiﬁcantly from these
expressions.

[37] For tunnel junctions, the plot pq vs q gives a measure
of the inhomogeneity corresponding to the so-called ’hot
spots’: pq is the proportion of the average current carried
by the proportion q of the junction area with currents
larger than xq.

Forecasting extreme events in collective dynamics:
an analytic signal approach to detecting discrete scale invariance

(Dated: September 26, 2013)

A challenging problem in physics concerns the possibility of forecasting rare but extreme phenom-
ena such as large earthquakes, ﬁnancial market crashes, and material rupture. A promising line of
research involves the early detection of precursory log-periodic oscillations to help forecast extreme
events in collective phenomena where discrete scale invariance plays an important role. Here I inves-
tigate two distinct approaches towards the general problem of how to detect log-periodic oscillations
in arbitrary time series without prior knowledge of the location of the moveable singularity. I ﬁrst
show that the problem has a deﬁnite solution in Fourier space, however the technique involved re-
quires an unrealistically large signal to noise ratio. I then show that the quadrature signal obtained
via analytic continuation onto the imaginary axis, using the Hilbert transform, necessarily retains
the log-periodicities found in the original signal. This ﬁnding allows the development of a new
method of detecting log-periodic oscillations that relies on calculation of the instantaneous phase of
the analytic signal. I illustrate the method by applying it to the well documented stock market crash
of 1987. Finally, I discuss the relevance of these ﬁndings for parametric rather than nonparametric
estimation of critical times.

INTRODUCTION

More than a decade of pioneering research involving
catastrophic phenomena as diverse as the rupture [1] of
high pressure rocket tanks [2], stock market crashes [3]
and earthquakes [4] has lent growing credibility [5, 6] to
the hypothesis that such extreme events arise due to co-
herent large-scale collective behaviors observed in such
self-organizing systems [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,
12, 13]. An exciting prospect concerns the possibility of
prediction or forecasting of catastrophic events based on
the observation of discrete scale invariance. This inno-
vative approach, when applied to problems such as the
prediction of earthquakes or ﬁnancial crashes, questions
the common assumption that the absence of characteris-
tic scales seen in self-organizing [6, 14] complex systems
precludes the possibility of forecasting [6]. Instead, pre-
diction becomes possible due to the appearance of smaller
precursory events that in principle can help determine
the critical time tc of the catastrophic event, which one
can interpret as a ﬁnite time moveable singularity. One
does not directly observe the singularity due to ﬁnite size
eﬀects. Instead we observe an ultra-large event compa-
rable in magnitude to the system size. The best known
speciﬁc signature of discrete scale invariance involves log-
periodicity [5, 6, 15, 16]. Even a small improvement in
the ability to detect log-periodic oscillations may thus
have a relatively large impact, with potentially useful
applications.

Attempts to forecast extreme events by exploiting dis-
crete scale invariance and log-periodicity implicitly as-
sume an underlying information-carrying property of
some component in the signal studied. Indeed, in trying
to forecast an event for some variable f (t) that will occur

Typeset by REVTEX

at a future time t = tc, with the information [17] available
for f (t) at the present time t < tc, one implicitly assumes
the existence of correlations in the behavior of f (t). Such
correlations imply that the knowledge of the behavior of
f (t) in a certain period necessarily provides information
about the behavior at other (e.g., future) times. For
a continuous variable f , the maximum degree of corre-
lation arises for holomorphic or analytic f (t), since one
can then use analytic continuation to know f (t) for all fu-
ture times. No new information becomes available when
time elapses, because f (t) evolves deterministically. Con-
sider the well known example of classical Hamiltonian
systems. The ﬁne grained Gibbs entropy, equivalent to
the Shannon information measure, becomes a constant
of the motion for such systems due to Liouville’s theo-
rem (see ref. [18] for a discussion of other information
measures). Indeed, information can increase only if de-
terministic evolution becomes interrupted in some way,
e.g., perhaps by some stochastic process. Such interrup-
tions of deterministic evolution necessarily lead to breaks
in analytic behavior. From such considerations, it follows
as a logical consequence that the maximum possible rate
of transmission of information measured in bits per unit
time for a physical communication channel must equal
or exceed the rate of occurrence of non-analytic points in
the signal [19]

Detecting log-periodicity presents unique challenges.
Direct parametric estimation to obtain log-periodic ﬁts
can fail due to the presence of extreme ﬂuctuations as
well as due to the problem of large degeneracy of the so-
lutions, i.e. there exist too many good ﬁts that approx-
imate the best ﬁt. Parametric methods also fail because
often we do not know which underlying distribution to
assume. Moreover, the large scale catastrophic events
of interest may represent “outliers” that do not follow

the same distribution as the smaller scale events. Hence,
most of the research has tended to apply non-parametric
methods.

A widely used spectroscopic method for detecting log-
periodic oscillations involves changing the variable t to a
log-time τ ≡ ln(tc − t), and then studying the power
spectrum of the new series thus generated [3]. Log-
periodic oscillations will appear periodic in the log-time
τ. However, the data will no longer appear evenly sam-
pled. Hence standard FFT-based methods do not work
and instead one must obtain the spectrum via the Lomb
periodogram [20], which can handle unevenly sampled
points. In practice this method works remarkably well.
Since such nonparametric methods require prior knowl-
edge of the value of tc, here I investigate the general
problem of how we can detect log-periodic oscillations
without having prior knowledge of tc. Such a method
would in principle allow us to “ﬁne tune” our estimates
of tc, and then use the nonparametric methods that rely
on a priori knowledge of tc. The methods developed here
apply equally to a variety of time series, so a range of
applications become possible.

In this context, one of the most dreaded collective phe-
nomena of our times relates to the ﬁnancial and eco-
nomic crises that have punctuated our history since the
industrial revolution. Economic events, ranging in size
and diversity from the Great Depression to the ongoing
bursting of the real estate bubble in the US, aﬀect an at
least order of magnitude greater number of people than
earthquakes or tidal waves. Moreover, humans actively
participate in the dynamics of the economy whereas we
only passively watch tectonic plate movements. Indeed,
ﬁnancial crises have the potential to aﬀect almost every-
body (unlike, e.g., earthquakes). For such reasons, this
article limits the application of the new methods devel-
oped here to the study of cooperative economic phenom-
ena. Speciﬁcally, I have chosen to focus on the classic
ﬁnancial “correction” of 1987, when stock market indices
dropped ≈20% in an amazing display of cooperative be-
havior (i.e., “herding”) of otherwise rational individual
agents.

In Section II, I brieﬂy review discrete scale invariance
and log-periodicity. In Section III I develop techniques
for detecting discrete scale invariance.
In Sections IV
and V I illustrate the method and then apply it to the
stock market crash of 1987. Section VI concludes with a
discussion and a summary.

II. COMPLEX DIMENSIONS AND DISCRETE
SCALE INVARIANCE

The concept of dimensionality has undergone succes-
sive generalizations: from integer to fractional to nega-
tive to complex [21]. The fractional and complex [11]
dimensions have a relation to fractals [22, 23] and scale
invariance symmetry, i.e., when a system’s property ap-
pears unchanged under a transformation of scale. Power

tion

2

laws, such as f (t) ∼ tµ, play a fundamental role in de-
scribing scale invariance. A change of scale by a factor λ
does not alter the power law behavior: f (λt) = f (t)λµ.
Real power law exponents usually involve continuous
scale invariance.
In contrast, complex exponents bear
a relation to discrete scale invariance—a discrete rather
than continuous symmetry that holds only for certain
discrete values of the magniﬁcation λk = λk. The power-
ful formalism that emerged from the study and exploita-
tion of scale invariance in physical systems [24] became
known as the renormalization group (e.g., see ref. [25]).
These advances have led to the application of fractal con-
cepts and techniques to diverse systems, ranging from the
study of anomalous random walks [26, 27] and critical
points [28] to heart dynamics [29] and DNA organiza-
tion [30, 31].

To model a catastrophic event that corresponds to a
moveable singularity at time t = tc, we can consider
an arbitrary signal x(t) in terms of the renormalization
group formalism as follows:

F (tc − t) ≡ x(tc) − x(t)

′

tc − t

= φ(tc − t)

where φ denotes the ﬂow map and tc the critical time [32,
33]. The ﬂow map acts like a “zoom,” mapping the time
t to a new time t′. We can then express F (t) as a sum of
a singular part and a non-singular part as follows:

F (tc − t) = g(tc − t) +

F (φ(tc − t)) .

1
µ

Only the singular part contributes to the ultra-large
event, whereas the non-singular part only describes nor-
mal events. Close to the critical point, we can apply the
linear approximation φ(t) = λt to obtain the power law
solution, which satisﬁes

dF (tc − t)
d ln [tc − t]

= αF (tc − t)

with α = ln µ/ ln λ, i.e., we essentially ignore the non-
singular part. In practice this solution guarantees that
continuous scale invariance shows up as straight lines on
double log plots, with the slope given by α, which plays
the role of a fractal dimension or a scaling exponent.
If we allow this dimension or exponent to become com-
plex, α = z + iω, then the power law (tc − t)α becomes
(tc − t)z exp[iω ln[tc − t]], i.e., a power law modulated by
oscillations with angular frequency ω in the logarithm of
the time—hence the term log-periodic. Discrete scale in-
variance leads to complex exponents αn = z + iωn, with
ωn = 2πn/ ln λ.

In a number of applications, the ﬁrst order representa-

x(t) = A + B(t − tc)z + C(t − tc)z cos[ω ln(t − tc) + θ] (1)

captures enough of the relevant behavior to become use-
ful in forecasting and prediction applications [3]. Further

renormalization group symmetry considerations can lead
to higher order representations useful in some cases [32].
A diﬀerent approach to extending Eq. 1 involves the in-
clusion of higher harmonics. However, the linear approx-
imation leads us to expect the amplitude of the higher
order log-periodic corrections to decay exponentially fast
as a function of the order l of the harmonics [5]. The true
behavior (i.e., as opposed to the linear approximation) of
the higher order harmonics leads to a slower exponential
decay of the higher order harmonics. Nevertheless, the
ﬁrst harmonic still provides a good ﬁt and can account
for the experimental data. Having reviewed the basics of
discrete scale invariance, I next address the problem of
detecting it in arbitrary time series.

III. ANALYTIC BEHAVIOR AND DISCRETE
SCALE INVARIANCE

The relationship between analyticity and information
ﬂow discussed in Section I has inspired and allowed the
development here of methods for detecting discrete scale
invariance in arbitrary time series.

A. Detecting discrete scale invariance in Fourier
space

How can we exploit the role of correlations to detect
log-periodicity without prior knowledge of tc? The power
spectrum, deﬁned as the modulus squared of the Fourier
transform of the time series, allows us to measure cor-
relations. Indeed, one could also equivalently deﬁne the
power spectrum as the Fourier transform of the stan-
dard two-point autocorrelation function. As a starting
point, let us consider a useful but not widely known fact
about log-periodic time series and their Fourier trans-
forms. Discrete scale invariance in a time series can some-
times also become manifest in the frequency domain.

Mathematically, log-periodicity in the time domain ap-
pears in the frequency domain because complex expo-
nents also appear in the Fourier transform of the signal.
Consider the indeﬁnite Fourier integral

(cid:1)

(cid:21)

where Γ[·, ·] denotes the upper incomplete Gamma func-
tion. Note the terms of the form ω′ −iω. In practice we

3

can evaluate this integral with lower and upper integra-
tion limits t = −∞ and t = tc − ǫ to calculate the Fourier
transform.

Figs. 1 and 2 show log-periodic time series and their
power spectra S(f ), deﬁned as the modulus squared of
the Fourier transform of the time series. We clearly see
that the log-periodicity in the time domain manifests it-
self as log-periodicity in the frequency domain, within a
range of frequencies. Speciﬁcally, the log-periodic scaling
breaks down in the spectra at low and high frequencies
and the cutoﬀ frequencies depend both on the value of ω
as well as the temporal separation from the singularity.
Except for these high and low frequency cutoﬀs, discrete
scale invariance in the time domain manifests itself as
discrete scale invariance in the frequency domain. Note
that a similar relation holds for continuous scale invari-
ance, i.e.
the Fourier transform of a power law tailed
function f (t) ∼ t−α can also have a power law behavior
(e.g., at low frequencies).

An increase in the critical time tc leads to a decrease
in the upper cutoﬀ frequency in the log-periodicity of the
spectra. In principle one could exploit this relationship.
Indeed, we can show in a straightforward manner that
discrete scale invariance in Fourier space will break down
near an upper cutoﬀ frequency fhigh given by

ln[1 + 1/(fhigh(tc − tmax))] ≈ 2π/ω ,

(2)

where tmax denotes the largest time contained in the time
series. Except for too small ω, we can approximate

fhigh ≈

ω
2π(tc − tmax)

.

(3)

Hence, one could thus estimate tc knowing ω and the
upper cutoﬀ frequency in the spectra. We ﬁnd that this
relationship agrees fairly well for the data shown in Fig. 1.
Yet, in practice I expect that this method may not work
very well with real data. For realistic time series, the
spectrum contains too many other features that drown
out the log-periodic behavior. Perhaps one cannot sys-
tematically and reliably apply this method to detect log-
periodic oscillations in realistic scenarios. Nevertheless,
the concept appears to have validity on a fundamental
level.

Moreover, these ﬁndings oﬀer insight about the poten-
tial of investigating analytic behavior for detecting the
crucial log-periodicities.
Indeed, the basic premise of
forecasting based on exploiting “hidden” analytic proper-
ties appears valid. Continuing this line of reasoning leads
to a second approach. Next, I show below that the ana-
lytic signal obtained using the Hilbert transform of a time
series can help to isolate the log-periodic signature in ar-
bitrary time series. I brieﬂy outline the method here be-
fore describing it detail below. The method involves tak-
ing the Hilbert transform of the time series to obtain the
quadrature or analytic signal, consisting of the instan-
taneous amplitude and the instantaneous phase or argu-
ment. If the time series behaves purely log-periodically

tc = 65600 (b) and tc = 70000 (c), along with their corresponding power spectra (d,e,f). An increase in the critical time tc
leads to a decrease in the upper cutoﬀ frequency in the log-periodicity of the spectra. In principle, one could thus estimate tc.

∼ exp[iω ln(t − tc)], then the phase will behave logarith-
mically, ∼ ω ln(t − tc). On the other hand, experimen-
tally obtained data will realistically always have non-log-
periodic components, so a pure log-periodic series repre-
sents an impractical idealization.

In the more realistic case of a time series with a small
log-periodic component, the analytic signal phasor will
rotate log-periodically in the complex plane not around
the origin, but rather around some other point on the
complex plane. In principle this “center” or “focus” of
log-periodic rotation can itself ﬂuctuate in time, due to
the many other components that contribute to the an-
alytic signal. Hence, in the case of a small log-periodic
component in the time series, the phase of the analytic
signal will not vary as ∼ ω ln(t − tc). Instead the phase
will have a component that oscillates log-periodically, due
to the angle subtended at the origin by the analytic sig-
nal phasor tip. The log-periodicity contained in a time
series need not necessarily appear in the amplitude of the
analytic signal (e.g., consider how a pure log-periodic os-
cillation has constant amplitude). In contrast, the log-

periodicity necessarily appears in the phase of the an-
alytic signal. By studying the instantaneous phase, we
may thus enhance or highlight the log-periodicity appar-
ent in time series.

B. The Hilbert transform

The Hilbert transform Hf (x) of a function f (x) repre-
sents the convolution of the function f with 1/πx. Math-
ematically, we deﬁne the Hilbert transform as a Cauchy
principal value,

Hf (x) ≡

,

to avoid the singularity at x. Moreover, cancellation to-
wards ±∞ allows non-integrable functions to have well
deﬁned Hilbert transforms. The Hilbert transform also
corresponds to the inverse Fourier transform of the prod-
uct of the Fourier transform of f (x) with i sgn(x) (where

5

FIG. 2: More examples of log-periodic signals f (t) = cos[ω ln[t − tc]] shown for t = 1, 2, 3, . . . 216 with tc = 216 + 1 and ω = 30
(a), ω = 20 (b) and ω = 10 (c), along with their respective power spectra (d,e,f). As a general rule, for low frequencies at
least, discrete scale invariance in the time domain also manifests itself in the frequency domain. Notice that variation of the
time-domain angular frequency ω leads to a change in the log-periodicity observed in the frequency-domain. In principle, one
could thus estimate tc knowing ω and the upper cutoﬀ frequency in the spectra (see. Fig 1). In practice, however, we cannot
rely on this method for the more realistic case of noisy data. This limitation motivates other approaches for estimating tc for
actual experimentally measured time series.

the latter gives the Fourier transform of 1/πx). Hence the
Hilbert transform eﬀectively maintains the Fourier am-
plitudes but shifts all phases by −π/2. Hence H 2 = −11.

The Hilbert transform of x(t) allows us to deﬁne an

analytic signal

χ(t) ≡ x(t) + iHx(t) = A(t) exp[iϕ(t)] ,

where A(t) and ϕ(t) represent the instantaneous ampli-
tude and phase of the signal. This and related properties
have led Hilbert transforms to have important and di-
verse applications (e.g., see refs. [34, 35]).

C. Analytic signal of log-periodic data

For a pure log-periodic analytic signal
χ(t) = exp[iω ln[tc − t]]

the “unwrapped” instantaneous phase will follow

ϕ(t) = ω ln[tc − t].

Since in Nature we typically observe log-periodicity “dec-
orating” a power law or else hidden in noisy data, we
must consider an analytic signal of the form

χ(t) = χ0(t) + a exp[iω ln[tc − t] = A(t) exp[iϕ(t)] ,

with a ≪ χ0(t). Let χ0(t) = A0(t) exp[iϕ0(t)]. Then

A(t) =

Notice that log-periodicity need not appear in A(t), by
considering for instance, the important case A0(t) = 0,
for which we obtain A(t) = a = constant.
In con-
trast, log-periodicity will always appear in the phase ϕ(t),
which contains the information arising from the com-
plex exponents associated with discrete scale invariance.
The phase, calculated as an arctan will belong to a sin-
gle branch on the complex plane, but we can “unwrap”
the phase to make it vary outside the conventional range
−π/2 ≤ ϕ ≤ π/2, to avoid abrupt discontinuities at the
branch cut.

IV. AN ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE

The technique developed above ﬁnds practical applica-
tion to arbitrary time series. Consider, as an illustrative
example, the log-periodic oscillation decorating a power
law shown in Fig. 3(a). In a realistic situation, we would
never observe such a clean signal. Rather, it would be
embedded in noise or added to other types of signals.
Fig. 3(b) shows the same log-periodic signal with noise
added. Our goal involves ﬁnding the critical time from
such data.

Let us thus use the signal shown in Fig. 3(b) as our test
data. Applying the method described in the previous
section, Fig. 3(c) shows the discrete Hilbert transform

FIG. 5: The times (open circles) corresponding to the extrema
of the log-periodicity shown in Fig. 3(e), as well as the product
∆tn/(1 − exp[−π/ω]) of the inter-extrema intervals and the
scaling factor of the geometric series of Eq. 5 (open squares).
Their sum should equal the critical time tc and we indeed
observe this (ﬁlled diamonds). We thus obtain an estimate
tc = 11040 ± 370. Compare this estimate with the known
value tc = 11000. The discrepancy lies below 1% and the
standard deviation represents less than 5%.

of the signal and Fig. 3(d),(e) show the instantaneous
phase calculated from the analytic signal before and after
detrending.

The last plot, shown in Fig. 3(e), permits an estima-
tion of the times of the minima and maxima. I have used
quadratic regression ﬁts in the region of the extrema, due
to the validity of the parabolic approximation. In princi-
ple, other methods may work equally well. Alternatively,
one could estimate the times corresponding to the zeroes
rather than the extrema. Yet another possibility includes
direct parametric ﬁtting of a log-periodic cosine function.
I have not used this direct parametric estimation due to
the reasons mentioned in Section II.

Nevertheless, knowledge of the times of the extrema
permits parametric estimation of the log-periodic angular
frequency ω Fig. 4. I have used

∆tn = exp[−πn/ω](exp[−πω] − 1) ,

(4)

where n denotes an arbitrary integer index to identify
successive extrema and ∆t(n) ≡ tn+1 − tn represent the
inter-extrema intervals. The limit n → ∞ leads to the
singularity. The regression coeﬃcient obtained leads to
a value of ω = 21.6, compared with the known value
ω = 21.71. Notice the remarkable agreement.

Once we have knowledge of ω and the positions of the
extrema (or zeroes), it becomes straightforward to ﬁnd
the critical time. From Eq. (4) it follows that the inter-

cated their positions labelled by the index n. Notice that the

they actually appear distinct at smaller scales (not shown).
The decreasing intervals for successive n ≥ 2 suggests the
possibility of discrete scale invariance.

We thus obtain an estimate for tc (ﬁlled diamonds). Table I
summarizes the results.

In summary, the method uses the following steps: (i)
generation of the analytic signal from the original time
series, (ii) extraction of the instantaneous phase and any
necessary “unwrapping” of the phase, (iii) detrending
with polynomial regression etc., (iv) testing for evidence
of log-periodicity using more conventional methods.
If
applicable, then the ﬁnal and most important step con-
sists of estimating the location of the moveable time sin-

gularity tc by regression methods.

The above example illustrates step by step the appli-
cation of the method to arbitrary time series. Below I
apply the method to actual empirical data. Indeed, the
crucial question concerns whether the method works for
actual experimental data. I have chosen for this purpose
the stock market crash of 1987, since it represents a well
known event in which the collective social behavior of in-
dividual economic agents unleashed ﬁnancial havoc and
in which systematic studies have documented the role
played by log-periodicities.

V. THE STOCK MARKET CRASH OF 1987

Fig. 6(a) shows data corresponding to approximately
5000 business days of the S&P500 ﬁnancial index [36]
(which has ticker symbol “SPC”). The area in grey shows
the crash of October 1987, when stock markets lost some
20% of their valuation. Since the idea behind the pro-
posed method involves forecasting the crash, I applied
the method only to the data shown in black. The data
in grey appears only for greater visual clarity.

Fig. 6(b) shows the instantaneous phase ϕ′(t) after de-
trending with polynomial regression. To emphasize the
oscillations, I have further detrended the data by sub-
tracting a uniformly weighted moving average y(t) with
varying window size, using

y(t) =

1
tmax − t + 1

t′=t

(t

where tmax corresponds to the last point of the series.
I arbitrarily have chosen 17 June 1987 as the last data
point included in the test. This date corresponds to some
80 business days (i.e., several months) antecedent to the
crash of October 1987.

Fig. 6(c) shows the phase after detrending with y(t). I
have estimated the positions of the maxima using using
parabolic regression and have arbitrarily labelled each
maxima with an index n = 1, 2, . . . . , 8. Notice that
for n ≤ 2 no sign appears of the characteristic log-
periodicity. However, for n ≥ 2 the intervals between
maxima become smaller, consistent with a possible log-
periodicity. I have chosen to show only the maxima, be-
cause the minima appear less clear. So in what follows,
note that I use a phase variation of 2π for successive n,
in contrast to the a phase variation of π for the inter-
extrema intervals. So we must replace Eq. 5 by

and Eq. 6 similarly becomes

∆tn+1
∆tn

= exp[−2π/ω] ,

tc = tn +

∆tn
1 − exp[−π/ω]

.

Fig. 7 shows the inter-maxima intervals ∆tn. Notice
the approximate exponential behavior. Using regression,

we can estimate the log-periodic angular frequency ω1.
Then, we can apply Eq. 6 to estimate the crash, assuming
that it should occur near the singularity. Fig. 8 shows the
estimates for tc and Table I summarizes the results. All
estimates contain the actual crash within the margins of
error. Clearly, we must reject any estimate for tc that
occurs within the dates studied, since we know a priori
that no such event transpired.

VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS

Several points deserve commenting. One thought-
provoking point concerns the analysis of the 1987 crash.
The results reported here might bear some relation to
previous ﬁndings. The very large-scale log-periodic os-
cillations seen in Fig. 6 are not inconsistent with similar
conclusions in previous studies [6]. Such results raise a
number of questions and the implications merit further
study. Was the ﬁnancial crisis of 1987, which few had
anticipated even one month prior to the crash, really be-
ing slowly built up over large time scales spanning years?
Were the individual and institutional agents really start-
ing to behave collectively so long before the crash? What
about the implication for the individual agents:
is our
apparently “free will” essentially irrelevant to collective
dynamics?

Moreover, in the past few years, ﬁnancial institutions
(and some individuals) have started to use automated
trading software to buy and sell ﬁnancial assets (in real
time [37]). Each algorithmic “robo-trader” [38] follows a
given set of rules of arbitrary complexity, however other
traders (human and robotic) do not know the speciﬁc
rules and thus cannot exploit them to obtain ﬁnancial
arbitrage. How will the advent of large numbers of robo-
traders aﬀect the collective dynamics and what are the
implications relating to the probability of ﬁnancial crises?
Another noteworthy aspect concerns the the general
nature of the methods developed here, whose application
goes beyond ﬁnancial data. One of the major diﬃcul-
ties in parametric estimation of log-periodic properties
It is not in-
is due to the lack of foreknowledge of tc.
conceivable that even small improvements in the ability
to estimate tc can be of potential use in forecasting re-
search. It would be interesting to apply and further study
the method using other data sets. Given the recent ap-
plication of physical methodologies to study music time
series [39], it is even conceivable that such methods could
be applied to obtain quantitative descriptions of aesthetic
phenomena in the arts. In fact, wherever cooperative ef-
fects are involved, there is a real possibility that discrete
scale invariance plays some role. For example, an inter-
esting question, in this context, is whether the method
is applicable to coherent noise phenomena [40, 41, 42].
Concerning the method itself, there is room for further
improvement, e.g., corrections for ﬁnite size eﬀects of the
conventionally used Hilbert transform algorithm. Simi-
larly, one could take into consideration the role of log-

TABLE I: Estimates of the log-periodic angular frequency ω and tc found from Fig. 7. The ﬁrst and last points in Fig. 7
(n = 1, 8) deviate further than the middle points from an exponential behavior. Therefore, I have shown three estimates for ω:
(i) taking all points into account, (ii) taking only the middle points into account, excluding the ﬁrst and last points, and (iii)
taking all but the the ﬁrst point into account. (The a priori known value is tc ≈ 9582.) In all three cases, I dropped the n = 1
point to estimate tc, since it clearly does not belong to the same regime as the other maxima, as seen in Fig. 8. Remarkably, all
three estimates for tc surprisingly bear consistency with the actual stock market crash that followed in the middle of October
1987.

periodic harmonics, which no doubt play an important
role in such phenomena. Such issues are important but
their relevance is secondary to the more signiﬁcant ques-
tion of the theoretical basis for the method. The in-
clusion here of further discussion about such secondary
issues would detract from the central focus.

In summary, I have investigated two distinct ap-
proaches towards the general problem of how to detect
log-periodic oscillations in arbitrary time series without
prior knowledge of the location of critical time. The more
promising method involves analytic continuation of the
signal onto the imaginary axis, using the Hilbert trans-
form.
I have shown that the instantaneous phase nec-
essarily retains the log-periodicities found in the origi-

nal signal and develop a new method of detecting log-
periodic oscillations. Initial results of the application of
the method to the stock market crash of 1987 motivate
further systematic studies to verify how much promise
this approach holds for forecasting extreme events.

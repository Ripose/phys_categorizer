Abstract

Ezhela V.V., Kuyanov Yu.V., Larin V.N., Siver A.S. The Inconstancy of the Fundamental Physical
Constants: Computational Status: IHEP Preprint 2004–36. – Protvino, 2004. – p. 14, ﬁgs. 2, tables 3,
refs.: 11.

It is argued that the CODATA recommended values of the fundamental physical constants could
not be used as the reference data in searching the hypothetical space-time variations of the fundamental
physical constants.

It is shown that the CODATA data permanently suﬀers a loss of self-consistency of the released data

due to unjustiﬁed over-rounding of their estimates.

The simple estimates of the critical numbers of decimal digits that should be saved in the indepen-
dently rounded correlation coeﬃcients, the average values and uncertainties to save the self-consistency
is obtained.

The set of high level quality requirements to the computerized presentation of the numerical data on

the jointly measured or estimated physical values are formulated.

It is argued (once again) that the common standard for presentation of the numerical values of

correlated quantities in publications and sites is urgently needed.

1. Motivation

The possible spae and time variations of the fundamental physial onstants (FPC) ontin-

uously attrat muh attention of different investigators sine the time when Dira has invented

the idea. Following a reent review of J.P. Uzan [1℄, a general strategy for searhes of the

variability an be outlined as follows:

• The hypothesis of onstany of the FPC an and must be heked experimentally.

• It only make sense to onsider the variations of dimensionless ombinations (ratios) of the

• If the FPC vary, they most probably vary jointly and slowly. This means that to notie

fundamental onstants.

FPC variations we should:

(cid:21) selet several well separated spae-time regions;

(cid:21) measure/estimate as preise as possible physis observables expressed in terms of the

FPC, that refer to the same spae-time region;

(cid:21) ompare values of onstants in the different spae-time regions, but extrated from

the (cid:16)spae-time region dependent" observables with the same urrent FPC evaluation

and adjustment methods.

Let VX,i denotes the set of FPC related random variables to be estimated and adjusted

by the method of least squares (for example) on the experimental data at spae-time region

X . This means that after the suessful adjustment we will have in the parametri V -spae
the vetor of average values hVX,ii and the orresponding ovariane matrix Cov(UX,i, UX,j),

haraterizing the interior of the (cid:16)satter ellipsoid(cid:17) entered at the end of the vetor of averages

(VX,i − hVX,ii) · [Cov(UX,i, UX,j)]−1 · (VX,j − hVX,ji) < 1.

(1)

The same ellipsoid an be represented with the help of orrelation matrix Cij(X) = Cor(UX,i,
UX,j) and standard deviations UX,i =

Cov(UX,i, UX,i) of VX,i.

To see the spae-time variability we should see the well separation of the satter ellipsoids in the

V -spae. Let us say that vetor V deviates from the satter ellipsoid obtained for X spae-time
region by RX(V, hVXi) standard deviation if

(Vi − hVX,ii) · [Cov(VX,i, VX,j)]−1 · (Vj − hVX,ji) = R2

X(V, hVXi).

(3)

ij
X

Then it is easy to see that the satter ellipsoids obtained for the X and Y regions will be well
separated if in the whole V spae we will have

R2

X(V, hVXi) + R2

Y (V, hVY i) > 2,

(4)

that means that the satter ellipsoids do not interset. Hene, to be able to notie the variability

we should have both: aurately estimated average values and orresponding satter ellipsoid

for every spae-time region where we estimate the FPC. It is the deliate problem as we will

show further.

The only and the best known well elaborated proedures to evaluate and adjust fundamental

physial onstants are implemented at the NIST Physis Laboratory [2℄. The set of FPC peri-

odially adjusted at NIST is reommended by CODATA as the referene soure of the FPC for

sientifi appliations and tehnology. In any attempt to notie the spae-time variability of the

FPC one annot avoid the CODATA reommended values, deemed in the physis ommunity

as the one of the best known set of FPC adjusted in the spae-time region where we are. But

unfortunately it is impossible. Simply beause we never had the set of the reommended FPC

orret enough for the testing their spae-time variability. To show this let us selet subsample

of the dimensionless FPC from the CODATA-2002 reommended set [5℄, say the set:

This matrix is non-positive definite matrix (it has one negative eigenvalue = −0.000293338).

This means that we have no satter ellipsoid, the orresponding (cid:16)satter region(cid:17) is unbounded

and the omparison with any other evaluations is senseless. This onfusion might be due to mis-

prints in the resoure database as of 2002, but this is not the ase. The same situation with

non-positive definite orrelation matries is present in all releases of the FPC produed by NIST

and approved/reommended by CODATA. Further examples of the wrong subsamples of the

CODATA reommended FPC see in the Table 1, where we ompare data from the last three

releases (V.3.0, V.3.2, V.4.0). The other examples presented also in our previous papers [6, 7℄

on this subjet.

Definitely something is wrong with the NIST evaluation/adjustment/presentation proedures.

We suspet that the origin of these permanent onfusions is the unjustified independent round-

ing of the output interrelated quantities: vetor of onstant estimates, their standard devia-

tions(unertainties) and their orrelations.

Superfiial independent rounding may lead to atastrophi hanges in the onnetion of

averages, standard unertainties and the satter ellipsoid: the rounded average values may get

out of the (cid:16)etalon(cid:17) satter ellipsoid obtained after rounding the orrelation matrix. The (cid:16)satter

region(cid:17) may turn to beome hyperboloid. From the other hand any numerial alulation is

performed with rounding or trunating deimal numbers.

3

To preserve the general properties of the FPC data struture, a speial quality assurane

proedures should be developed and applied. In the next setion we ollet the high level require-

ments to the set of FPC needed to guarantee the safe and orret usage of this key informational

2. High level requirements to the set of adjusted FPC

Let us introdue a few speial notations and definitions for different sets of FPC to simplify

formulation and disussions of the requirements.

or (cid:16)basi FPC(cid:17) is the set of onstants that partiipated in the fits to the experimental

data via observational equations.

or (cid:16)derived FPC(cid:17) is the set of onstants and units onversion fators that are known

to be funtion dependent on basi onstants. Symbolially V D = F (V B) and they are evalu-
ated on the basis of the V B

with the proper propagation of the unertainties with the suffiient

auray to guarantee positive semidefinitness of the derived ovariane martix

.

1

V A

or (cid:16)adjusted FPC(cid:17) is the V B ∪ V D

with ross ovarianes (orrelations) added with

suffiient auray to obtain ombined ovariane matrix as positive semidefinite matrix.

V R

or (cid:16)reommended FPC(cid:17) is the V A

but rounded by NIST to be ompatly presented

in their publiations and as reommended data for siene and tehnology by CODATA.

All data sets V I

defined above have the same pair of strutures:

V I = {Average(V I), Covariance(V I)}

V I = {Average(V I), U ncertainty(U I), Correlator(CI)}.

Let us all the internal alulational auray of numerial presentation of all omponents of

obtained from the adjustment proedures as etalon auray.

2.1. Corretness and Self-onsisteny

If the adjustment of the onstants belonging to V B

is suessful then we have positive

definite ovariane (orrelation) matrix presented with an etalon auray, as well as the vetor

of average values.

We say that the V D

, V A

are orret if their ovariane (orrelation) matries are positive

semi-definite. In other words, we have suffiient internal alulation auray to obtain orret

resoure.

V B

V D

or

the V B

results.

1

By de(cid:28)nition the ovariane (orrelation) matrix for the jointly measured or estimated quantities is the positive

semide(cid:28)nite matrix, moreover if adjustment is performed by the least squares method the ovariane (orrelation)

matrix if presented with the etalon auray should be positive de(cid:28)nite for the suessful adjustment.

4

We say that the V R
1) V R ≡ V A
2) For any subset v(V R) ⊂ Average(V R) for whih orresponding ovariane submatrix

is orret and self-onsistent if one of two possibilities is true:

or

Cov(v(V R)) is positive definite we have

[v(V R) − v(V A)]i · [Cov(v(V A))]−1

ij · [v(V R) − v(V A)]j ≤ 1

or

[v(V R) − v(V A)]i · [Cov(v(V R))]−1

ij · [v(V R) − v(V A)]j ≤ 1.

These onditions guarantee the self-onsisteny of the V R

, e.g. that the rounded and un-

rounded satter ellipsoids are well interseted and unrounded and rounded subvetors belong to

that intersetion.

2.2. Reliability

We will say that the next release V R

subvetor v(V R

Y Y is reliable if it is orret, selfonsistent, and if any
Y Y ) with positive definite ovariane is ended in the point inside the satter

ellipsoid for the orresponding subvetor of the previous release. For example, for the 1998 and

2002 releases these onditions will read

[v(V R

02) − v(V A

98)]i · [Cov(v(V A

98))]−1

ij · [v(V R

02) − v(V A

98)]j ≤ 1.

The reliability indiator is onstruted with an assumption that the relative time variation of the

fundamental onstants during two suessive sessions of the adjustments are negligible ompared

with the average relative standard deviation of the onstants.

2.3. Availability

Next important quality indiator we propose is the availability of all data on FPC (average

values, unertainties, orrelations) in omputer readable forms with as maximal as possible

ompleteness and auray of numerial data. The importane of the availability is hard to

overestimate in the era of the Web ommuniations and Web and GRID omputations

.

2

It turns out that NIST and CODATA, in spite of the niely organized affiliation web ites

offer the urrent and arhived data on the FPC in the hopeless obsolete manner, as it will be

shown in the setions to follow.

2.4. Traeability

The traeability in the ontext of usage the reommended FPC is the aess to all input

experimental and theoretial material used in the adjustment as well as detailed desriptions of

the used proedures needed to reprodue the adjustment independently in ase of any suspiions

on the misprints in the database, ideologial or software bugs.

To taste the importane of the availability requirement we will reommend reader to try to hek our alu-

lations presented in the motivation setion, inluding the orretness of data extration from NIST publiations

2

and site.

3. Safety rounding off the orrelated quantities

Here we derive a simple suffiient estimates on the auray of a safely independent rounding

off the average values Vi, unertainties Ui, orrelations Cij obtained in jointly measurement or

estimation proedures with suffiient etalon auray.

Let (Vi, Ui, Cij), i, j = 1, . . . , n be the aggregate of n jointly measured or estimated
physial quantities, where numerial parts of Vi, Ui are the real numerial vetors, Ui > 0, Cij

is the real, symmetri, and positive definite matrix with matrix elements bounded as follows:

Cii = 1 for all

i = 1, . . . , n and |Ci6=j| < 1.0.

Suppose that for some reason we need to store and exhange numerial data on this aggregate

rounded to some auray A that is lower than the etalon one.
Let Rij be the (cid:16)rounder(cid:17) matrix, suh that if it is added to the matrix Cij , the obtained matrix
CR
i6=j| < 1 are deimal
numbers with A digits to the right of the deimal point.

ij = Cij + Rij will be real, symmetri, positive definite and all |CR

It is easy to see that matrix Rij should have the following properties:

Rii = 0 for all

i = 1, . . . , n and |Ri6=j| ≤ 5.0 × 10−A−1.

Let further c1 ≤ · · · ≤ cn, ρ1 ≤ · · · ≤ ρn, and cR

1 ≤ · · · ≤ cR

n be the ordered sets of

eigenvalues of the matries Cij , Rij , and CR
for any l = 1, . . . , n we have the following inequalities [8℄,[9℄:

ij orrespondingly. Then from the Weil's theorem

cl + ρ1 ≤ cR

l ≤ cl + ρn.

>From the Gershgorin's theorem on the distributions of the eigenvalues of the Hermitian

matries [8℄ it follows that

ρ1 ≥ −(n − 1) · 5 · 10−(A+1) = −

and hene to have the matrix CR

NOTE. Aording to the Weil's theorem any uniform rounding the off-diagonal matrix elements

of the positive semi-definite orrelation (ovariane) matrix is forbidden.

Indeed, as rounder matrix is traeless Hermitian matrix, it obliged to have the negative

minimal eigenvalue. Furthermore from the left inequality of the Weil's theorem statement it

follows that any rounding ould lead to the matrix with negative minimal eigenvalue.

Now let us larify to what auray we may round off the Vi and Ui in the deimal presenta-

i be the suh (cid:16)rounding vetor(cid:17) that the obtained rounded vetor V R

tions. Let RV

is still in the etalon satter ellipsoid. Then from the ondition (2) for the omponents of the

rounding vetor we will have

Now let us turn to the rounding of the unertainties Ui. It is the ommon pratie to present

the average values and unertainties with the same auray AV

i = AU

i . With this rule let us

rewrite inequality (9) in the form

is the preision of the Ui we will obtain

⌊log10(Ui)⌋ + 1 = P U

(cid:18)
One an see that right part of the inequality does not depend on index i, so we an introdue

The equation (11) give the minimal preision that should not be redued if we adopt the rule

that auray of the unertainties should be equal to the auray of the average values.

In summary: we have obtained n + 1 referene numbers Ath

C and AV

i defining the levels with

safety independent rounding off the deimal numerial presentation of the interrelated random

quantities: average values, their unertainties, and orrelations.

Having these numbers the strategy for the safety independent rounding an be as follows:

In self-onsistent numerial presentation of interrelated random quantities (Vi, Ui, Cij)
in deimal real numbers the average values Vi and the unertainties Ui should have at
least AV
i digits to the right of the deimal point and the orrelation oeffiients Ci6=j
should have at least Ath

C digits to the right of the deimal point.

4. Do the CODATA 2002 reommended FPC meet the high level quality

requirements?

In this setion we present some further evidenes of violations of the above high level require-

ments in the reent releases of the CODATA reommended values of the FPC.

4.1. Corretness & Selfonsisteny

In motivation setion we already presented the evidenes that the CODATA data on orre-

lations are inorret. Here we present an evidene that the average values of the reommended

FPC are also questionable, beause of over-rounding an easily move them out of the etalon sat-

ter ellipsoid. To hek this the whole adjustment proess should be repeated with the (cid:16)etalon

auray(cid:17).

preision it is not valid.

It turned out that we managed to ollet enough amount of data from the NIST publiations

to reprodue all steps of the evaluation and adjustment of the basi set of onstants [10℄ only

for the 1998 release. We had obtained the (cid:16)orret set of the basi onstants(cid:17) using methods

This equality is valid for real numbers only. For the integer number that treated as the numbers with in(cid:28)nite

and then alulated the threshold auraies for the elements of

the orrelation matrix, the averages and the unertainties. The results are as follows:

λC,min ≈ 7.58 · 10−7,

C = 8 (versus ACODAT A

Ath
= 3),
P U = 4 (versus P U,CODAT A = 2).

C

One an see that the CODATA data suffers the loss of self-onsisteny of the released data due

to unjustified over-rounding of their results.

Having the data on the FPC in the (cid:16)etalon auray(cid:17) we are able to show that the obtained

estimates for the threshold rounding indies are indeed lose to the real situation and should be

used as regulators for the orretness of the rounding. To show that the rounding proedure an

move the end of the vetor-of-onstants out of the etalon satter ellipsoid we will use the sample

of onstants that was mentioned in [1℄ as the andidates to trae the large-sale spae-time

variability of their dimensionless ombinations:

As the orrelation matrix of the unertainties in the input experimental data is not a positive de(cid:28)nite matrix

there (supposedly by overrounding for publiation), we were fored to (cid:16)un-round(cid:17) several matrix elements to have

positive de(cid:28)nite weight matrix in the least squares method of adjustment.

The Plank onstant is the basi one, the other seleted are derived onstants. In alulating the orresponding

orrelation matrix we use the minimal possible auray that give us the positive de(cid:28)nite orrelation matrix.

thresholds AV

In the Table 3 we present the values of the differenes hVii − V r

i between

alulated average values of the seleted onstants with the etalon auray and the rounded

step-by-step values to show that after the predited moment the end point of the rounded vetor

will be moved out of the etalon satter ellipsoid for many standards R(V r, hV i).

We see that our indies proposed as the suffiient number of digits for the safety rounding

are indeed lose to the reality. They an and should be used to the quality ontrol of the random

vetors obtained by statistial estimation proedures.

Another lesson from the omparisons presented above is that the problem of the orret

rounding off the FPC triad (Vi, Ui, Cij) is the very important problem in the task of traing

the spae-time variability of the FPC as the improper rounding will mimi the evolution of

rounding.

4.2. Reliability

As it was mentioned in the desriptions of the high level quality requirements, it is natural

to suppose that the next iteration of the adjustment will give onstants more aurate and more

selfonsistent than the previous adjustments.

Let us look for the time evolution of the estimates of one of the most important physial

onstant (cid:22) the Planks onstant h from the time of disovery up to the 2002 estimate. The

historial perspetive of the Plank onstant estimates one an find in [11℄.

estimates that still are far from been stable, though the amplitude of variation is

redued in the last two releases.

This (cid:16)small-sale time variability(cid:17) of the Plank onstant estimates we attribute to the possible

presene of the hidden (not estimated) systemati error introdued or missed by the adjustment

proedures.

It should be noted that systematist have to use ontraditory input data whih

The (cid:16)evidene(cid:17) of the possible stabilization (see Fig. 2 is very preliminary and should be

tested for the other onstants simultaneously by traing the variation of the hodograph of the

(cid:16)vetor of basi onstants(cid:17) as it is outlined in the reliability requirement. Unfortunately it is

not possible now beause of the orrupted data on orrelations in the releases. The onlusion

based on the reliability indiator is that the CODATA reommended values annot be used in

searhes of the possible large sale spae-time variations of the FPC.

4.3. Availability

The web aess to the data on FPC offered by NIST & CODATA in the last release (V.4.0) is

greatly improved. Now we have easy aess to all data on average values and their unertainties

just opy the file in the ASCII format. But unfortunately in the released list the values of 7

basi onstants out of 29 partiipating in the adjustment proess did not quoted. The values of

the other 28 important parameters (possible orretions to the theoretial expressions) for the

whole adjustment proedure are omitted. They even did not disussed in the publiations on

12

the 1998 release.

As it was disussed in the previous setions, the ignorane of the orrelations is inadmissable

in the high preision physis appliations. But the aess to the reommended orrelation oeffi-

ients remains to be the (cid:16)misanthropi(cid:17) one. It is hard to get data for an operative alulations

with several onstants simultaneously. There is no easy and safety way to get the omplete data

on the subsample of the triad (Vi, Ui, Ci,j) in a truly omputer readable form.

To extrat data on say 10 onstants with the orrelation matrix one have to produe about

300 flip-flops between web-pages (cid:16)by hands(cid:17).

4.4. Traeability

Traeability means that any release of the reommended FPC set should be aompanied

with full toolkit of the input data and methods to give interested user possibility to perform all

steps of the adjustment proess and to ompare the results with the reommended values.

Unfortunately materials attahed to the reommended FPC are not omplete as it was

stressed in the disussions of the availability indiator. Additional example is the inorret

presentation of the orrelations of unertainties in the input experimental data of the 1998 re-

lease.

The data on input orrelations are presented only in the review on the paper [4℄ and the

orrelation matrix is non positive definite there [7℄.

It should be noted also that in the published douments related to the releases of FPC there

are no disussions of the proedures used for rounding off the orrelated quantities.

Summarizing the above disussions and evidenes we are fored to stress that all high level

quality requirements to the sientifi information numerial data resoure: orretness, selfon-

sisteny, availability, reliability, and traeability are badly violated in at least the last three

releases of the CODATA reommended values of the fundamental physial onstants.

They ould not be used as referene data to monitor the large sale spae-time variability of

the fundamental physial onstants and moreover their usage in physis appliations where the

high preision alulations are needed is highly questionable.

The positive outome from our ritial treatment of the quality aspets of the entral numer-

ial sientifi information resoure are:

• the preliminary proposal for the safety rounding strategy in presentation the results of high

preision omputations of the physial observables;

• the proposal for the set of quality indiators to ertify sientifi information resoures for

the safety usage in physis appliations;

• the proposal of the data struture and proedures for the omplete and user friendly

Web-FPC.

Abstract

We study the information metric on instanton moduli spaces in two-dimensional nonlinear
sigma models. In the CP1 model, the information metric on the moduli space of one instanton

with the topological charge Q = k (k

1) is a three-dimensional hyperbolic metric, which

corresponds to Euclidean Anti-de Sitter spacetime metric in three dimensions, and the overall
scale factor of the information metric is 4k2
We also calculate the information metric in the CP2 model.

1. Introduction

A parameterized family of probability distributions is often treated as a statistical model,

which is deeply related to nonlinear sigma (NLσ) models. The NLσ models have arisen in

various contents: the Heisenberg ferromagnet model, the quantum Hall eﬀect, and other

statistical mechanics problems; and the conformal ﬁeld theory, string theory, and Yang-Mills

(YM) theories in four dimensions.

In such models, instantons play an important role in

nonperturbative analyses. From the geometrical point of view, the information metric arises

as a metric on the moduli space of the instantons, and in more general as a metric on a

manifold of probability distributions. It is generally deﬁned by

GAB =

dDx p(x; θ) ∂Alog p(x; θ) ∂Blog p(x; θ) ,

(1)

Z

where p(x; θ) is the probability density function of x, parameterized by θ [1][2]. Here, x is
assumed to belong to a ﬂat D-dimensional space RD, θ is a real N-dimensional parameter

(θ1, θ2,

, θN ), and ∂A is the derivative with respect to the parameters θA (A = 1, 2,

, N).

The space of the parameters correspond to the instanton moduli space in this paper. If we

· · ·

· · ·

treat the normalized topological charge density of the instantons, which is the same with

the normalized energy density, as the probability density function, the information metric

on the moduli space of the instantons naturally appears from the deﬁnition (1).

The information metric on the moduli space of the instantons has been studied in YM

theories in four dimensions and in NLσ models in two dimensions. It has been shown so

far that the information metric is isometric to hyperbolic space when one instanton with

topological charge one exists in a SU(2) YM theory [3][4][5] or in a rational map [6] which

is correspondent to a NLσ model in two dimensions, and also that the information metric

is nondegenerate for the moduli space of the multi-instantons in rational maps [6]. What

has not been done so far is to study the concrete dependence of the information metric on

the topological charge of the instantons. That is what we shall do in this paper. We shall

in particular compute the overall scale factor, which corresponds to the square of “radius”,

of the information metric in the moduli space of one instanton with the topological charge

which is greater than or equal to one. The negative reciprocal of the overall scale factor

of the information metric is directly correspondent to the curvature, which is the sectional

curvature to be exact. In the geometrical analyses about the NLσ models and statistical

models in general, it is important to investigate the curvature of the moduli spaces where

the instantons live.

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we brieﬂy review the CPn NLσ model. In

section 3, we compute the information metric on the moduli space of one instanton with the
topological charge which is greater than or equal to one in the CP1 model. And furthermore,
we compute the information metric in the CP2 model. In section 4, we draw conclusions and

indicate some interesting possibilities to extend our work.

2. Deﬁnition of the CPn NLσ model

To deﬁne the two-dimensional CPn model, we take an (n+1)-dimensional complex vector

ﬁeld Φ [7][8]:

time:

The CPn model is deﬁned by the Lagrangian density

in two-dimensional Euclidean space-

Φ = t(φ1, φ2,

where Dµ (µ = 1, 2) is the covariant derivative deﬁned by

and α is the multiplier ﬁeld imposing the constraint Φ†Φ = 1, and g is the coupling constant.

This model has the global SU(n + 1) symmetry and the U(1) local symmetry.

The CPn model deﬁned above has a topological charge Q, which is also called a winding

If the self-dual equation

is satisﬁed, then the equation of motion is automatically satisﬁed. Using this self-dual

equation, we get the topological charge density q as follows

which is proportional to the Lagrangian density under the constraint Φ†Φ = 1, namely, the

relation between the Lagrangian density and the topological charge density is

3. Information metrics on moduli spaces of instantons

To ﬁnd the self-dual solution, let us parameterize the ﬁeld Φ as follows

where W is an (n + 1)-dimensional vector:

Φ =

W
√W †W

,

W = t(w1, w2,

, wn+1) .

· · ·

Substituting this Φ into the self-dual equation (9), we ﬁnd that if ∂¯zW = 0, then the self-
dual equation is satisﬁed, where z = x1 + ix2. Moreover, by making use of the U(1) local
symmetry, we can take W as W = t(η, u2, u3,

.un+1), where η is a real number (η

0)

and ui’s (i = 2, 3,

· · ·

· · ·
, n + 1) are rational functions.

3-1. Information metric in the CP1 model

Let us consider the instanton solution in the CP1 model, which is the most simple NLσ

model. Since the purpose of this paper is to investigate the information metric on the moduli

space of the instanton with the topological charge which is greater than or equal to one, we

adopt the following self-dual solution

W = t(λk, (z

a)k) ,

(14)

where a = a1 + ia2 and k is any positive integer. Here, λ and a correspond to instanton

moduli parameters. The topological charge density of this instanton solution is given by

charge of the instanton solution (14) is k : Q = k. We take the normalized topological charge

density, which corresponds to the normalized energy density or the normalized Lagrangian

density in the Euclidean spacetime, as the probability density function p(z; λ, a) of the
instanton in the CP1 model:

By substituting this probability density function into the deﬁnition of the information metric

the information metric on the moduli space of one anti-instanton with the topological charge

4/3 k, which means that the sectional curvature is

curvature.

3-2. Information metric in the CP2 model

In the CP2 model, we consider the information metric on the moduli space of instantons

which have Q = 1 and moduli parameters (λ, a, b). The instanton solution is

2)2 .

This is indeed the same as the probability density function for one instanton with Q = 1 in
the CP1 model (see eq.(16)). Therefore, the information metric of the moduli space (Λ, c, δ)

is easily obtained:

where ~c = (c1, c2). This information metric represents the hyperbolic three-space, which

corresponds to the Euclidean Anti-de Sitter spacetime in three dimensions, in the same way

as the case of the CP1 model mentioned in 3-1. Notice that there is no dependence on
the parameter δ and d~δ in this information metric, where ~δ = (δ1, δ2). The substitution

of equations (25)(26)(27) (28) into (30) leads to the information metric for the moduli

parameters (λ, a, b):

4. Conclusions and Discussions

We have shown that in the CP1 model the information metric on the moduli space of

one instanton with the topological charge Q = k (k

1) is the Euclidean Anti-de Sitter

spacetime metric in three dimensions. The overall scale factor of the information metric is
4k2
3
3 , and this means that the “radius” R =
4k2 . If k
becomes very large, the spacetime approaches a ﬂat spacetime. Furthermore, we have also
computed the information metric of the moduli space of the instanton in the CP2 model.

4/3 k and the sectional curvature is

The NLσ model often arises in string theory as well as in various statistical mechanics

problems. Since the topological charge of the instanton may be related to the Ramond-

Ramond charge or the D-instanton charge in string theory, it is worthwhile to attempt to

apply the above results to the correspondence between conformal ﬁeld theories and string

theories in the Anti-de Sitter spacetime, which is called the AdS/CFT correspondence [9].

It is particularly interesting to investigate the relation between three-dimensional Anti-de

Sitter spacetime and a kind of two-dimensional NLσ model from the point of view of string

6

theory. Furthermore, we should study the information metric on the moduli space of multi-

instantons in the NLσ models, the YM theories and supergravity theory in more detail.

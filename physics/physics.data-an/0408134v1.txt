Abstract

In this work we present a new idea to develop a method to sep-
arate stochastic and deterministic information contained in an
electrocardiogram, ECG, which may provide new sources of in-
formation with diagnostic purposes. We assume that the ECG
has information corresponding to many diﬀerent processes re-
lated with the cardiac activity as well as contamination from
diﬀerent sources related with the measurement procedure and
the nature of the observed system itself. The method starts
with the application of an improuved archetypal analysis to
separate the mentioned stochastic and deterministic informa-
tion. From the stochastic point of view we analyze Renyi
entropies, and with respect to the deterministic perspective
we calculate the autocorrelation function and the correspond-
ing correlation time. We show that healthy and pathologic
information may be stochastic and/or deterministic, can be
identiﬁed by diﬀerent measures and located in diﬀerent parts
of the ECG.

1. Introduction

An electrocardiogram, ECG, is a time series of measure-
ments of one observable of a complex system:
surface
electric potentials measured between two poles around
the heart. The location of the poles depend on the deriva-
tion in use [1]. We may consider that the complex system
under study is the cardiac activity constituted by sev-
eral processes, and also related to many other processes
including neural, mechanical, hormonal, etc. Therefore,
the ECG contains mixed information of diﬀerent sources
and time scales. The nature of the useful information,
deterministic or stochastic, that can be extracted from an
ECG, depends on the characteristics of the corresponding
underlying process, on the process of measurement, and
on the capabilities of detecting and diﬀerentiating deter-
ministic from stochastic information. The separation of
these two kinds of information is diﬃcult, in particular
for ECGs and other time series of physiological origin. In
general applications, the a priori knowledge that we have
of the information and/or the contamination, facilitates
this separation, which are not well deﬁned in the case
of physiological signals [2,3]. Traditionally, the informa-
tion contained in an ECG has clinical relevance when it
is visually identiﬁed by an expert cardiologist [1]. The
stochastic and deterministic information extracted from
the ECG may provide new sources of information that
cannot be identiﬁed visually and, therefore, they give

complementary information to measure the quality of the
cardiac activity using the ECG as the unique source of
information not accesible by other means.
In this work we present a method to detect and character-
ize information not visually detectable in the ECG, it can
be deterministic or stochastic. We consider that the ECG
contains deterministic information, stochastic information
and contamination. The ﬁrst is called deterministic be-
cause we assume that in principle there is a deterministic
model that may represent such information. The stochas-
tic part can also be described with models of the evolution
of the probability distribution of the possible states of the
system. The contamination is a consequence of the real
limitations of the ECG as a time series: ﬁnite resolution,
ﬁnite number of data points, measurement sources of noise
and nonstationarity.
The method is based on an improved version of an archety-
pal analysis by constructing a special base of archetypes
to capture relevant characteristics of the ECG. In general,
the reconstruction of a signal with archetypes is selfcon-
sistent because the base of archetypes is constructed from
the signal itself. What is speciﬁc of a particular signal is
how the archetypal base is constructed. Recognizing the
strong but not perfect periodicity of the ECG, we have
prepared a particular archetypal base which permits us to
overcome the dominant periodicity of the ECG and thus
identify and measure small variations as deterministic and
stochastic information. These two informations cannot be
detected by visual analysis of the ECG as is tradition-
ally done by a cardiologist.
In this work we perform a
numerical experiment controlling two known ECGs from
a healthy and a pathological case, instead of a large sta-
tistical study with many diﬀerent ECGs, to detect and
measure stochastic and deterministic information.
It is
important to highlight that the construction of the special
base of archetypes does not reduce the detected stochastic
and deterministic informations to the variability of the
R-R intervals. The R-R series is used as an internal sys-
tem of reference for the archetypes as selfconsistency of
the method. One purpose of the numerically controlled
experiment is preciselly to show how the changes not rel-
evant to the visual analysis of an expert, such as small
dampening of the T wave, may be clearly measured by
this method. This provides a new source of information
useful for diagnostic and possibly with certain predictive
power identifying tendencies of cardiac activity before
they become clear pathologies.
In section 2 we present the procedure to ﬁlter out the two

sources of contamination mentioned above corresponding
to nonstationarity and noise, and the method to perform
the separation of the deterministic and stochastic informa-
tion. This includes the construction of the archetype-base
as will be presented. In section 3 we present the appli-
cation of the method to the mentioned ECGs in order
to characterize the information. Section 4 presents the
results and section 5 corresponds to the discussion and
conclusions of this work.

2. Preprocessing and Archetypal Analysis

Before we study the ECGs we apply a preprocessing of
the signal in order to get rid of some contamination but
taking care of the rest of the information contained in the
ECG. Given the ﬁnite resolution and the ﬁnite time of a
typical ECG, we consider two sources of contamination
that have to be ﬁltered out before any further analysis is
performed. We study four ECGs: the ﬁrst corresponds to
a healthy patient 25 years old male, H, the second is the
same healthy ECG but with its T wave smoothed with a
normal local average, SP1; this is an apparently healthy
ECG but we call it Simulated pathology 1 because of its
smoothed T wave. The third ECG also corresponds to a
simulated pathology obtained from the healthy ECG by
suppressing the T-wave, SP2; this pathology corresponds
to a myocardial damage [1]. The last ECG corresponds
to a real pathologic case, MITP, it is the ﬁle 100 of the
MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database [4], corresponding to a
supraventricular ectopy [1,4].
In the extreme of low frequencies, or large time scales, we
observe trends or modulations. These trends are ﬁltered
out by a time space ﬁltering replacing each data point by
the average of itself and its 70 neighbors on each side using
a Gaussian distribution. Since the measuring frequency is
300Hz, this average covers 0.47 seconds which corresponds
approximately to one half of the time between successive
heart beats. However, the Gaussian distribution makes
the signiﬁcative number of neighbors used for smoothing
to be 10 on each side of each data point, approximately a
time span of 0.07 seconds which does not compromise any
relevant structure of the ECG. This procedure also ﬁlters
out high frequency noise observed as fast ﬂuctuations. In
ﬁgure 1 we present a few seconds of the four mentioned
ECGs that will be studied in this work. We do not make
any further treatment to ﬁlter out any other contamina-
tion considering that the information, deterministic and
stochastic, may be distributed in most of the frequency
range of the whole power spectrum of the ECG.
We ﬁrst ﬁnd the R peaks of the ECG. Then we normal-
ize the R-to-R pseudo-periods with a length equal to the
greater R-R distance. The traditional archetypal analy-
sis constructs the set of archetypes from the whole set
of R-to-R pseudo-periods. We group the R-to-R pseudo-
periods in ﬁve groups ordering their size from the small-
est to the largest. Then we ﬁnd the set of archetypes
for each group. The middle group, the one around the
mean value, has most of the RR intervals. We take the
ﬁrst three archetypes obtained from this group. Propor-

tionally, we take two from the two groups at each side of
the central group, and one from each of the two exter-
nal groups. See ﬁgure 2. These nine archetypes consti-
tute the archetype-base to reconstruct the corresponding
ECG. See ﬁgure 3. The archetypes of each group are esti-
mated as follows [5-7]: Consider a set of multivariate data
{xi, i = 1, ..., n} where each xi is an m-dimensional vec-
tor. By means of Archetypal Analysis we search a set of
m-dimensional vectors zj that characterize the archetypal
patterns in the data. The patterns z1, ..., zp are mixtures
of the data values {xi}. Speciﬁcally, let zk = Pi βkixi
be an archetypal element. Here βki ≥ 0 and Pi βki = 1.
The {aik}, k = 1, .., p, are deﬁned as the minimizer of
||xi − Pk aikzk||. Here aik ≥ 0 and Pk aik = 1. Finally,
we deﬁne the archetypal patterns as the mixtures z1, ..., zp
that minimize Pi ||xi − Pk aikzk||2.

3. Archetypal Coeﬃcients Analysis

The reconstruction of each ECG from the archetype-base,
generates a time series of values for each archetype and
each ECG. These values measure the contribution of the
corresponding archetypes as they are compared with the
succesive RR intervals. We analyze the time series of each
coeﬃcient for each ECG to measure the stochastic and de-
terministic information potentially contained in each case.

indicate the archetype-base used of 9 archetypes.

We ﬁrst perform a stochastic analysis of these time se-
ries using a symbolic representation. The range of values

2

of any coeﬃcient is between 0 and 1. We reduce all the
possible values to four symbolic values, 0, 1, 2 and 3, cor-
responding to the ranges of 0 to 0.25, 0.25 to 0.5, 0.5 to
0.75 and 0.75 to 1 respectively. This approach reduces the
details but highlights the most representative qualitative
characteristics. With these four symbols we can construct
43 = 64 words of three symbols, and then we obtain the
probability distribution for each time series representing
the 9 coeﬃcients obtained from each of the four ECGs
analyzed in this work. The Renyi entropies given by

give a quantitative measure of the stochastic information
contained in these distributions [8]. From the determinis-
tic point of view, we calculate the autocorrelation function
of these 36 time series of coeﬃcients and estimate the cor-
relation time for each case. The autocorrelation function

This procedure measures the contribution of the corre-

val. Therefore, the mean value of the coeﬃcient of each
archetype measures the importance of this archetype for
the morphology of the whole ECG.

4. Results

In ﬁgures 4 to 6 we present the most interesting results of
this work. In ﬁgure 4 we plot the average of the archetypal
coeﬃcients for the four ECGs as indicated in the ﬁgure.
These averages are the mean values of each coeﬃcient.
A coeﬃcient mean value is obtained from the values of
the coeﬃcient as the corresponding archetype is compared
with each RR interval.

Figure 5 presents the results of two diﬀerent Renyi en-
tropies, for q = 1/4 and q = 4. These entropies are
measures of disorder where the small and large proba-
bilities dominate respectively. The healthy and T-wave
smoothed ECG, H and SP1, present larger average en-
tropies and smaller standard deviations for q = 1/4 than
the two artiﬁcial and real pathologic ECGs, SP2 and
MITP. These results indicate that the stochastic informa-
tion is homogeneously distributed in healthy ECGs and
that this distrubution of stochastic information is lost in
the pathologic cases.

Figure 6 shows the correlation time t,
for the nine
archetype coeﬃcients of the four ECGs, estimated from
equation (4) when C(t) = 1/3C(0). We observe that cor-
relation times are larger for healthier ECGs, H and SP1,
and smaller for pathologic ECGs, SP2 and MITP. We can
also observe appreciable diﬀerences between H and SP1,
and SP2 and MITP.

5. Discussion and Conclusions

With this work we do not pretend to ﬁnd new physics
nor develop all the technical details and standarization of
a new tool for diagnostic using the ECG as the unique
source of information. As we understand the scope of
applied physics, we present a method of applying new
concepts with improved techniques and show its potential
to help in the solution of actual problems in cardiac diag-
nostics. For the discussion of results we have to keep in
mind that SP1 actually resembles a healthy case, whereas
SP2 does not.
If a given coeﬃcient does not change apreciably along the
analyzed ECG, it means that the morphology represented
by this particular archetype is invariant throughout the
ECG. On the other extreme, if the values change a lot
and randomly, the corresponding morphology changes
randomly. An intermediate behavior may indicate some
order that can be characterized by a stochastic distribu-
tion and/or deterministic correlations.
The mean values of H 1/4 for H are large and a little larger
for SP1. The corresponding values of H 1/4 for the SP2
are small and still a little smaller for MITP. This means
that the morphologies represented by the archetypes are,
in average, more disordered for the healthy ECG than the
corresponding to the two, artiﬁcial and real, pathologic
cases, SP2 and MITP. In addition the standard deviations
of H 1/4 are smaller for H and SP1, and larger for SP2 and
MITP. This indicates that the morphologies represented
by the archetype are homogeneously distributed over the

4

nine archetypes of the archetype-base; for the pathologic
cases the disorder is more localized in some archetypes
than in others. Therefore, healthier ECGs present more
disorder, higher entropies, than the pathologic ECGs.
The correlation time, obtained from the autocorrelation
function of the coeﬃcients, shows that the local mor-
phologies of the healthier ECGs are more correlated than
the pathologic ECGs. This temporal correlation indicates
some deterministic information in the ECG that is more
evident in healthier ECGs. As a conclusion, we observe
that the method presented in this work detect strong evi-
dences of stochastic and deterministic useful information
in ECGs. These two kinds of information can diferentiate
pathologic and healthy ECGs even when the diﬀerences
cannot be detected by visual analysis. We have succeeded
to some extent, to separate these two informations from
the ECG, measure them for some trial controlled and
known cases, and show the distinctic characteristics of
each one as they are extracted from the diﬀerent ECGs.
These results are consisten with the complex nature of the
cardiac dynamics where stochastic and deterministic as-
pects are both present in a complex mixture. The quality
of cardiac dynamics may be characterized from the ECG
as the unique source of information.

We describe a test statistic for unbinned goodness-of-ﬁt of data in one dimension. The statistic is based on
the two-dimensional Random Walk. The rejection power of this test is explored both for simple and compound
hypotheses and, for the examples explored, it is found to be comparable to that for the χ2 test. We discuss
brieﬂy how it may be possible to extend this test to multi-dimensional data.

1. Introduction

2. Random Walk as a Test of Flatness

This search for an unbinned goodness-of-ﬁt test
has been motivated by the widespread use of un-
binned maximum likelihood ﬁtting for determining
CP -violating parameters at Belle. While there are
many cross-checks to insure that there are no spurious
signals and biases, the ﬁts tend to be complicated and
not very transparent. They often involve probability
density functions (PDF’s) that diﬀer with every event,
based on measured quantities that add dimensions to
the data that are not explicit in the ﬁts. As there is
no widely accepted unbinned goodness-of-ﬁt test that
applies to such ﬁts, testing for statistical consistency
of results has been uneven. The tests that have been
done, resorting to binned χ2 or toy Monte Carlo, have
their place but have not been entirely satisfactory in
addressing the question.

A common technique of unbinned tests involves ﬁrst
transforming the measured quantities to a variable in
which the null hypothesis has a uniform distribution,
where the PDF is ﬂat, and then to test this “ﬂattened”
distribution for consistency with uniformity. There
exists a variety of tests for uniformity, but most are
not readily extended to multidimensional data, and
they do not address compound hypotheses. A review
of methods is given in [1].

In this report, we explore a test statistic that is
based on the two-dimensional Random Walk. To be-
gin, its distribution in the case of a ﬂat PDF is dis-
cussed. The ensemble distribution is then found for
several alternate hypotheses, and the rejection power
is calculated for comparison with other goodness-of-
ﬁt tests. As the aim of a goodness-of-ﬁt test as it
would be applied at Belle is to test the validity of the
parametrization used in ﬁtting, it is also important to
examine how the test is modiﬁed under compound hy-
potheses. The discussion is thus expanded to include
data which are ﬁtted to determine one or more param-
eters. Finally, we discuss the possibility of extending
to multidimensional data.

A dataset consisting of N measurements of the one-
dimensional quantity x lying in the interval [0, 1] may
be mapped trivially to points on a unit circle with po-
lar angle φ on the interval [0, 2π], so that each point
is considered to be a unit vector with direction de-
If the PDF in x is ﬂat, the vector sum
ﬁned by φ.
of the corresponding unit vectors in two dimensions
corresponds to the net displacement, D, after a two-
dimensional Random Walk of N steps with unit step
size. For suﬃciently large N , this distribution con-
verges to a well-known form (Rayleigh, 1888) and the
distribution in D2 is an exponential decay with mean
equal to N . We take D2/N as the test statistic. A
deviation of the root distribution from the hypothe-
sis will result in a bias of the ensemble distribution of
this test statistic away from the origin. This statistic
is mathematically equivalent to the ﬁrst order term
in the Fourier series that describes the distribution of
the data:

F (k = 1) =

dφ

eikφδ(φ − φj)

(1)

2π

N

Xj=1

Z

N

Xj=1

=

eiφj

where one can see that D2 ∝ |F(1)|2. One would ex-
pect this distribution to be most sensitive to an overall
imbalance of the PDF in generally opposite φ direc-
tions. To obtain sensitivity to higher order diﬀerences,
one could thus take successively higher order terms in
the series, for k = 2, ....
In practice it may not be
useful to examine terms above k = 3. In this study
we look at k = 1 (d = 1) and deﬁne Kk ≡ |F (k)|
N .
What we have deﬁned as K1 appears in the review of
D’Agostino and Stephens[2] as R in the context of the
Von Mises test, a test for uniformity on a circle.

3. Flat PDF

As mentioned above, the K1 distribution for a ﬂat
PDF converges rapidly to an exponential with a de-
cay constant of unity. Figure 1 (top row) shows the
distributions in K1 for ensembles of randomly gen-
erated experiments containing N = 10, 100, and

1000 events. Each of the three distributions is ﬁt-
ted via binned maximum likelihood to an exponential
form. The ﬁtted inverse decay constants (“slopes”)
are 0.992 ± 0.010, 1.008 ± 0.033, and 1.039 ± 0.049,
respectively, in excellent agreement with the expecta-
tion.

To evaluate rejection power, these distributions may
be compared with those obtained for PDF’s that are
not ﬂat. The alternative hypotheses used in a study
by Aslan and Zech [3] provide a convenient range of
function types and allow for a direct comparson with
the range of tests reviewed in their work.
In that
paper the rejection power of the alternative hypothesis
was deﬁned as one minus the probability for an error
of the second kind, given a criterion that yields a 5%
signiﬁcance for the null hypothesis. Since in this case
the null hypothesis gives an exponential distribution
with unit decay constant, the 5% criterion is K1 > 3.0.
Ensembles of experiments were generated for each of
three functions used in Ref. [3]:

A1(X) = 0.3 + 1.4X
A2(X) = 0.7 + 0.3[n2e−64(X−0.5)

]

A3(X) = 0.8 + 0.2[n3e−256(X−0.5)

where the ni are normalization constants for the as-
sociated Gaussians. All functions are deﬁned in the
interval [0, 1]. The resulting K1 distributions for A1
are shown in Figure 1 (bottom row). The values for
rejection power are summarized in Table I. For com-
parison, the values for the χ2 method (N = 100) given
by Ref. [3] are approximately 0.81, 0.85, and 0.81, re-
spectively, so our method is comparable in power, at
least in the case of these three functions.

In order to apply this method as a goodness-of-ﬁt
test for non-uniform null hypotheses the PDF, f (X),
must ﬁrst be transformed to a “ﬂat” variable, Y ,
where the probability distribution is ﬂat. To form
a uniform null hypothesis on a circle one could, for

4. Compound hypotheses

The examples considered thus far have been ones
where no parameter ﬁtting has occurred. While this
has been an instructive exercise, it has limited ap-
plication, as most measurements in particle physics
involve the ﬁtting of measured distributions to deter-
mine shapes and to derive some physics quantity or
conclusion. We now look at compound hypotheses.

In evaluating rejection of alternative hypotheses
via toy MC in the compound case, it is important
that the ﬁtting process be integrated into the evalu-
ation procedure. Consider a data set {φi} where the

PDF is assumed to be parametrizable as f (φ; α) and
the unbinned likelihood is maximum for α = αmax.
The data are then ﬂattened assuming the PDF is
f (φ; αmax), and the associated K1 is evaluated. The
conﬁdence level of this K1 value may then be found
by referencing the ensemble distribution of K1 when
the true PDF is f (φ; αmax), and each experiment of
the ensemble is treated as data, ﬁtted and ﬂattened
according to the ﬁt.

This procedure was used to evaluate rejection power
for pairs of similarly shaped PDF’s. Here we show one
such result, for the hypothesis n4(α)e−10Xα, where n4
is a normalization constant, the measured quantity

is X, and experiments are ﬁtted for α. The alter-
native PDF was the linear form f (X) = 2(1 − X).
Experiments were generated according to the alterna-
tive PDF (A), and each was ﬁtted to the hypothesis.
The mean maximum likelihood value of α was approx-
imately 4.7. Ensembles (B) were generated according
to the hypothesis, with α = 4.7, and ﬁtted in the same
way. The 5% conﬁdence criterion on K1 for (B) and
acceptance of this criterion for (A) were estimated by
counting (Figure 2). The rejection powers were found
to be 28% and 99% for N = 100 and N = 1000, re-
spectively. For comparison we also calculated by the
same procedure the rejection of the χ2 test, using 20
bins in the interval [0,1] and found powers of 13% and
100%, respectively.

Figure 3: Scatter plots of ﬁtted parameter αmax vs. K1
for ensembles shown in Figure 2 (N = 100).

We also examined the two-dimensional distribution
of ﬁtted αmax values vs. K1. Any dependence of the
test on the ﬁtted rather than underlying parameter
value reduces its utility as a goodness-of-ﬁt test; for
example, the maximum likelihood value, Lmax, is not
usable as a goodness-of-ﬁt statistic because it depends
strongly on the ﬁtted parameter value(s) αmax – for
a certain class of ﬁtting functions, the correlation is
100%[4]. Figure 3 shows scatter plots of αmax and

K1, where the data were generated with N = 100
and the generated and ﬁtted forms are those from the
example of Figure 2. There appears to be no strong
dependence.

In any determination of rejection power with a com-
pound hypothesis, it is necessary to determine the dis-
tribution of K1 for the correct hypothesis. It does not
appear that there is a simple ansatz as in the case of
binned least squares ﬁtting, where the chisquare con-
verges to a chisquare distribution with the number of
degrees of freedom reduced by one unit for each linear
ﬁtted parameter. We study this question empirically
by generating MC ensembles for a variety of shapes.
Each ensemble was generated according to the ﬁtted
functional form with parameter value(s) ﬁxed. Each
experiment was ﬁtted with parameter(s) ﬂoating, and
the K1 value was obtained from the data ﬂattened ac-
cording to the best ﬁt. The distribution of resultant
K1 values for each ensemble was ﬁtted for the decay
constant, assuming an exponentially decaying form.
Ensembles with N = 10, N = 100, and N = 1000
were generated. The results are summarized in Ta-
ble 4. There are several notable features. First, while
all of the K1 distributions had a decaying form, as one
might expect, and a ﬁt that converged, not all yielded
good ﬁts; the exponential form is not preserved un-
der compound hypotheses. Secondly, all inverse decay
constants are greater than unity, indicating that the
K1 distribution moves toward zero with ﬁtting. This
is not suprising; ﬁtting identiﬁes for each experiment
the shape that is “closest” to the data, giving in gen-
eral a better goodness-of-ﬁt than the generator shape.
Finally, there is no obvious pattern in the value of
the decay constant with number of ﬂoated parame-
ters. However, it is seen that for a given PDF and set
of ﬁtted parameters, the shape of the K1 distribution
shows remarkably little change as N is changed by two
orders of magnitude.

5. Extension to multidimensional data:
speculation

Our goal in this investigation has been to arrive at
a multidimensional unbinned goodness-of-ﬁt test, one
that has rejection power in all dimensions, not just
in one-dimensional projections, for multidimensional
data. Many unbinned tests depend on the integrated
sum of or spacings between neighboring data points,
quantities which are not well-deﬁned when extended
to more than one dimension. Although the K1 statis-
tic does not have this property, it is yet to be deter-
mined whether there exists an extension that is fully
multidimensional; for example, in two dimensions, two
components each mapped to a circle corresponds to a
data space that is the surface of a toroid, for which
there is no obvious nontrivial vector sum that maps to
the Random Walk. A fully general extension to multi-
dimensional data will additionally require a ﬂattening
algorithm and provisions for data spaces of arbitrary
shape. We will continue to explore the possibilities for
extending K1 for use with multidimensional data.

6. Summary

We have explored an unbinned goodness-of-ﬁt test
for data in one dimension that is based on the map-
ping of ﬂattened distributions to a two-dimensional
random walk. This method is truly binning-free and
scale-independent, and the ensemble distribution for
the null hypothesis is well-deﬁned. For a compound
hypothesis we specify a procedure to determine the
ensemble distribution of the test statistic via Monte
Carlo so that rejection power may be readily deter-
mined. The distribution is found for several diﬀerent
parametrized forms and shown to be largely indepen-

dent of statistics. We examine several samples for de-
pendence between the test statistic and ﬁtted param-
eter values, and ﬁnd no evidence of any. The rejection
power for alternate hypotheses is demonstrated for a
few examples and is found to be comparable to that
of the chisquare method.

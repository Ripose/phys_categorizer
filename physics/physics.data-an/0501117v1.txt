A surrogate data analysis is presented, which is based on the ﬂuctuations of the “entropy” S
deﬁned in the natural time-domain [Phys. Rev. E 68, 031106, 2003]. This entropy is not a static
one as, for example, the Shannon entropy. The analysis is applied to three types of time-series,
i.e., seismic electric signals, “artiﬁcial” noises and electrocardiograms, and “recognizes” the non-
Markovianity in all these signals. Furthermore, it diﬀerentiates the electrocardiograms of healthy
humans from those of the sudden cardiac death ones. If δS and δSshuf denote the standard deviation
when calculating the entropy by means of a time-window sweeping through the original data and
the “shuﬄed” (randomized) data, respectively, it seems that the ratio δSshuf /δS plays a key-role.
The physical meaning of δSshuf is investigated.

In an electric signal consisting of N pulses, the nat-

pulse the value χk = k/N . The analysis is then made
in terms of the couple (χk, Qk) where Qk stands for the
duration of the k-th pulse. The entropy S, deﬁned[1, 3]

found[3] to distinguish Seismic Electric Signals (SES)
activities from artiﬁcial noises (AN), where the latter
terminology stands for electrical disturbances which are
recorded at a measuring site due to nearby man-made
electric sources. More precisely, SES activities and AN
have S-values smaller and larger than that (Su) of a “uni-
form” (u) distribution, respectively (as the latter was de-
ﬁned in Refs. [1, 3, 4]). Furthermore, ion current ﬂuctu-
ations in membrane channels (ICFMC) have S very close
to Su [3].

The fact that a system contains nonlinear components
does not necessarily reﬂect that a speciﬁc signal we mea-
sure from the system also exhibits nonlinear features.
Thus, before analyzing this signal by applying nonlin-
ear techniques, we must ﬁrst clarify if the use of such
techniques is justiﬁed by the data available. The method
of surrogate data has been extensively used to serve such
a purpose (see Ref. [5] for a review). Surrogate data refer
to data that preserve certain linear statistic properties of
the experimental data, but are random otherwise[6, 7].
These data are prepared by various procedures; for exam-
ple, Siwy et al.[7] in order to study the nature of dwell-
time series in ICFMC, among other methods, also used
surrogate data which have been obtained by three diﬀer-

ent procedures. The present paper aims, in general, at
presenting a kind of surrogate data analysis using the en-
tropy ﬂuctuations in the natural time-domain (see below)
as discriminating statistics. Throughout the paper, the
surrogate data are obtained by shuﬄing the Qk randomly
and hence their distribution is conserved. Applying such
a procedure, we do the following: consider the null hy-
pothesis that the data consist of independent draws from
a ﬁxed probability distribution of the dwell times; if we
ﬁnd signiﬁcantly diﬀerent serial correlations in the data
and their shuﬄes, we can reject the hypothesis of inde-
pendence, see paragraph 3.1 of Ref. [5]. In other words,
the tested null hypothesis is that Qk are independent and
identically distributed (iid) random variables, i.e., that
there are no correlations between the lengths of consec-
utive intervals.
If the original (continuous) time series
is Markovian then the null hypothesis for the Qk should
hold, i.e., the Qk are iid. We emphasize that the termi-
nology “Markovian” throughout this paper always refers
to the original time series.

Here, as a measure of the natural time entropy ﬂuc-
tuations we consider the standard deviation δS when we
calculate the value of S for a number of consecutive pulses
and study how S varies when sweeping this time-window
through the whole time-series. We use the following three
data sets: Two of them are those treated in Ref. [3], i.e.,
SES activities and AN. As a third one, we preferred to
use, instead of ICFMC, the case of electrocardiograms
(ECG), for several reasons, chief among of which are: (a)
They are publicly accessible [8]. (b) Instead of the single
ICFMC example, a large variety of ECG are available
(i.e., 105 individuals are employed here, 10 healthy and
95 patients). (c) The case of ECG is similar to ICFMC,
in the sense that the S-value in ECG results very close
to Su as in ICFMC investigated in [3]. Note, however,
that the intervals between heart beats ﬂuctuate widely,
e.g., [9].

A general agreement about whether or not normal
heart dynamics are chaotic or not chaotic is still lack-

ing (e.g., see Ref.[10] and references therein). The most
commonly used non-linear complexity measures are frac-
tal dimensions of various kinds (e.g., correlation dimen-
sion, Renyi dimensions). Each of them measures diﬀerent
aspects of the statistics on the attractor. On the other
hand, Liapunov exponents and the Kolmogorov-Sinai en-
tropy (K-S entropy) and entropy rates are measures of
the dynamics on an attractor. Except for the K-S en-
tropy and entropy rates, the other categories of complex-
ity measures assume a purely deterministic system (e.g.,
see Ref.[11]). Since a physiological time series may be
due to a mixed process, stochastic and deterministic, the
use of fractal dimensions in physiological time series has
been occasionally criticized[11]. On the other hand, en-
tropy is a concept equally applicable to deterministic as
well as stochastic processes. This is why we preferred to
use the entropy in natural time (more precisely its ﬂuc-
tuations δS ) as discriminating statistics. The following
point, however, should be stressed. Complexity measures
based on static entropy (e.g., Shannon entropy) quantify
statistical order in the time series. The underlying key-
property of these complexity measures is the probability
distribution of the (dwell times in the) data analyzed;
thus, the result of such computations should be indepen-
dent of permutations performed on the (sequence of the
dwell times in the) time series as in a surrogate (random-
ized) data set obtained by data shuﬄing. On the other
hand, the entropy in natural time (and the relevant mea-
sures) considers, from its deﬁnition, the sequential order
(of beats); in other words, S is a dynamic entropy, i.e., it
captures characteristics of the dynamics in a system. Ad-
ditional comments on the importance of the ﬂuctuations
of S in ECG will be forwarded in Section V.

δS
h

In all examples, we use a sliding window of length three
to ten pulses, except otherwise stated. Concerning the
symbols: We reserve δS only for the case when the cal-
culation is made by a single time-window, e.g., 5 pulses.
The symbol δS denotes the average of the δS-values cal-
culated for a sequence of single windows, e.g., 3, 4 and
5 pulses. Finally,
stands for the δS-values averaged
over a group of individuals, e.g., the 10 healthy subjects.
The present paper is organized as follows: In section
II, we investigate whether a distinction between SES ac-
tivities and AN can be achieved by the δS-value alone.
Furthermore, we examine if δS can recognize the non-
Markovianity in all the signals investigated. In section
III, we attempt to shed light on the quantity δSshuf cal-
culated in a surrogate (randomized) data set obtained
by data “shuﬄing”. We ﬁnd that δSshuf in ECG is a
measure of σ/µ (where µ and σ stand for the mean value
and the standard deviation of the corresponding inter-
vals, see below). Section IV shows that the δSshuf -value
the entropy S is not
diﬀers from δS, as expected (cf.
static entropy,as mentioned above). The prominent role
of the ratio δSshuf /δS in distinguishing ECG of healthy
humans from those suﬀered from sudden cardiac death
is shown in Section V. The conclusions are summarized
in Section VI. Finally, an Appendix is reserved to derive

an exact relationship between δSshuf and σ/µ when Qk
are iid.

II. THE POSSIBILITY OF EMPLOYING δS TO
“RECOGNIZE” THE NON-MARKOVIANITY

We start by examining whether the δS-values alone
can distinguish SES activities from AN as well as “recog-
nize” their non-Markovianity. Recall[2, 3], that SES and
AN are time-series of dichotomous nature which are non
Markovian. In a dichotomous Markovian time-series, the
dwell times (Qk) are exponentially distributed; for such
a series we plot, in Fig. 1(a), the δS-value versus the
time-window length. (Since in the calculation of S only
ratios of Qk are involved the result does not depend on
the transition rates of the Markovian process.) The error
shown in this case is on the average 7%. (The calcula-
tion was made for a total number of 102 pulses, see be-
low. Note that this error decreases upon increasing the
2% for 103 pulses,
number of pulses, i.e., it becomes
which will be used later). In the same ﬁgure, we insert
the δS-values calculated for the four SES activities (la-
belled K1, K2, A, U) and the six AN (labelled n1 to n6)
depicted in Fig. 1 of Ref. [3]. An inspection of Fig.1(a)
reveals the following conclusions. First, no distinction
between SES activities and AN (both of which have es-
timation errors comparable to the aforementioned error
of the Markovian) is obvious. An inspection of Table I
of [12], reveals that the number of pulses in three (out
of the four) SES activities is around 102, for K2, U and
A (while for K1, is
310) and this is why we calculated
here the Markovian case for 102 pulses. Second, concern-
ing the possibility of “recognizing” the non-Markovianity
(as discussed and shown in Refs.
[2–4] by independent
procedures): This could be possibly supported, only for
the shorter time-windows (i.e., 3, 4 and possibly 5 pulses)
for all SES activities as well as for most AN (i.e., n6, n4,
n3, n2, possibly n1, but not for n5), see Fig.1(a).

We now investigate if the δS-values alone can “rec-
ognize” the non-Markovianity in ECG. In a single si-
nus (normal) cycle of an ECG, the turning points are
labelled with the letters P, Q, R, S and T. We used
here the QT database from physiobank [8]( see also [13]),
which consists of 105 ﬁfteen-minute excerpts of Holter
recordings as follows: 10 from MIT-BIH Normal Si-
nus Rhythm Database (i.e., healthy subjects, hereafter
labelled H), 15 from MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database
(MIT), 13 from MIT-BIH Supraventricular Arrhythmia
Database (MSV), 6 from MIT-BIH ST Change Database
(MST), 33 from the European ST-T Database (EST),
4 from MIT-BIH Long-Term ECG Database (LT) and
24 from sudden death patients from BIH(SD). (cf. BIH
denotes the Beth Israel Hospital).
In Fig. 2, we plot,
for the QRS-interval time-series, the δS-value averaged
over each of the aforementioned seven groups versus the
time-window length. Since all time-series of these seven
103 intervals, we insert in the same ﬁgure
groups have

the results calculated for a Markovian case (cf. with the
procedure mentioned in the previous paragraph) of com-
103. We see that the Markovian case
parable length
exhibits δS-values that are roughly one order of magni-
tude larger than those of the seven groups of humans,
which clearly points to the non-Markovianity of all the
signals in these groups. We emphasize that the same
conclusions are drawn if we consider, instead of QRS-,
the series of QT-intervals, or the beat-to-beat intervals
(RR). In summary, the δS-value alone can well recognize
the non-Markovianity in ECG.

This points to the conclusion that δSshuf provides, as
intuitively expected, a measure of σ/µ. (This, however,
cannot be supported with certainty for the SES activities
and AN.) Note that, although these three slopes are more
or less comparable, they diﬀer by amounts lying outside
their standard error. Furthermore, it may be worthwhile
to mention, that if we study altogether the RR-, QT- and
QRS-intervals, for the 10 healthy humans only (Fig. 4),
a good linearity of σ/µ versus δSshuf results with a slope
37.5
if we study each of the three intervals
separately, we ﬁnd slopes that agree within the error mar-
0.1 for the
gins, i.e., 37.5

of this common behavior merits further investigation.

IV. ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN δS AND
δSshuf

We ﬁrst comment on the diﬀerence between δS and
δSshuf in the SES activities and AN. In Fig. 1(b), the
value of δS versus the corresponding δSshuf was plotted,
for each of the ten signals discussed in Fig. 1(a). The
average values in Fig. 1(b) have been calculated over the
three time-windows of 3, 4 and 5 pulses, since we men-
tioned in Section II that the “recognition” of the non-
Markovianity in all SES activities becomes possible in
this time-window range. If we disregard n6, and despite
the errors of around 5% (for the time-window range 3-5),
we may say that there is a systematic tendency point-
ing to a value of δSshuf /δS larger than unity (cf. the
same conclusion is drawn, if we take the averages over
the time-window range 3-10). This is consistent with
the non-Markovianity of all these signals, because for a
Markovian case we expect δSshuf =δS. (Since, by def-
inition, δSshuf corresponds to the entropy ﬂuctuations
upon random mixing of Qk, see Section I, it is naturally
expected that in a Markovian case the two quantities δS
and δSshuf should coincide). Note that the reverse is not
always true (thus the equality δSshuf = δS may also hold
for non-Markovian time series) as will be demonstrated
below with precise examples.

We now proceed to compare δSshuf with δS in ECG.
Figure 5(a) depicts the δS-values, calculated for each of
the 105 individuals, versus the corresponding δSshuf for
the RR-intervals (time-window range 3-10 beats). The
same is repeated in Figs. 5(b) and 5(c) for the QT- and
QRS-intervals, respectively.
In each case, we also plot
the straight line δSshuf =δS to visualize that the vast
majority of points fall below this line. The non-equality
of δSshuf and δS has been also veriﬁed by applying the
Wilcoxon paired signed-rank test recommended[14] to be

followed for non-Gaussian paired data. The tested null
hypothesis is that the means of δSshuf and δS are the
same and is rejected at a level of signiﬁcance well below
0.01, since the data of Figs. 5(a),(b) and (c) lead to nor-
mally distributed variables z =

respectively (cf.
the corresponding one-tailed asymp-
totic signiﬁcance is given by P (Z < z), i.e., the prob-
ability to obtain a normally distributed variable which
is smaller than z). Note that a least squares ﬁt to

Fs in ECG is 250 Hz; thus, if we take as an example
the RR-intervals, the experimental error in their alloca-
tion is around 1/Fs. The latter reﬂects in the calcula-
tion of δS and δSshuf errors which are drastically smaller
than those required to eventually justify a compatibility
of the expression δS = (0.76
0.03)δSshuf , found from
Fig.5(a), with a straight line of slope equal to unity, i.e.,
δS = δSshuf .

±

The diﬀerence between δS and δSshuf in ECG could
be understood in the context that the former depends
on the sequential order (of beats), as mentioned in Sec-
tion I, while the latter does not. Since short- (and long-)
[15] and
range correlations is a usual feature( see Ref.
references therein) in heartbeat dynamics, which are pos-
sibly destroyed (or become weaker) upon randomizing
the data, more “disorder” is intuitively expected to ap-
pear after randomization, thus reﬂecting δSshuf > δS.
Furthermore, note that in all the three plots of Fig. 5
there are some drastic deviations from the straight line
δS = δSshuf . The origin of these deviations is currently
investigated in detail.

Finally, we further clarify the aforementioned point
that the equality δS = δSshuf does not necessarily reﬂect
Markovianity.
In Fig.6, we plot, for the QT-intervals,
δSshuf versus δS (for time-window range 3-10 beats)
for SD and H. We see that there are several individuals
(mainly SD, see also next section) of which their points lie
practically (i.e., within the error margins) on the straight
line δS = δSshuf . If we plot their δS- (or δSshuf -) values
versus the time-window (in a similar fashion as in Fig.
2), we ﬁnd that these values are distinctly smaller than
those of the Markovian case, thus making clear that these
individuals cannot be characterized as exhibiting Marko-
vian behavior. (This non-Markovianity holds for all H

and all SD.)

V. THE USE OF δSshuf /δS TO DISTINGUISH
ECG OF HEALTHY HUMANS FROM THE
SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH ONES

Here we focus only on two groups of ECG, namely H
and SD, and examine whether they can be distinguished
by means of the ratio δSshuf /δS. We calculate this ratio,
for each type of interval, at two ranges: (i) a short (s)
range 3-4 beats (cf. consider that the smallest number
allowed for the natural time-domain analysis is 3 beats)
and (ii) a longer (L) range 50-70 beats. For the sake of
convenience, we deﬁne ν
δSshuf /δS, and hence the
≡
following ratios are investigated: νs(τ ) and νL(τ ), where
τ denotes the type of interval (i.e., τ =RR, QRS or QT)
and s, L refer to the range studied (i.e., s = 3-4 beats
and L=50-70 beats).

The calculated values for νs(τ ) and νL(τ ) for the three
types of intervals are given, for all H and SD, in Table
I. The minima minH [νκ(τ )] and maxima maxH [νκ(τ )]
(where κ denotes either the short, κ = s, or the longer,
κ = L, range) among the healthy subjects are also in-
serted in two separate rows, for each type of interval and
each range studied. These minima and maxima are la-
beled Hmin and Hmax, respectively. The cases of SD
which have smaller and larger values than Hmin and
Hmax (reported in each column) are marked with su-
perscripts “a” and “b” respectively.

A careful inspection of Table I leads to the following
main conclusion: All SD violate one or more H-limits
(i.e., they have values that are smaller than Hmin or
larger than Hmax). We intentionally emphasize that this
conclusion is also drawn even when disregarding the re-
sults for the QT-intervals.
(Concerning the latter in-
tervals: Only 5 SD out of 24 violate the H-limits; how-
ever, in all SD, their δS-values themselves are larger than
those in H, see also Fig. 6. The usefulness of this dif-
ference will be discussed in detail elsewhere). In other
words, when focusing our investigation solely on the RR-
and QRS-intervals, all SD violate one or more of the
four H-limits related to νs(RR), νL(RR), νs(QRS) and
νL(QRS). This is important from practical point of view,
because the RR- and QRS-intervals can be detected more
easily (and accurately) than the QT- by means of an
automatic threshold based detector (e.g., see Ref.
[16],
which evaluated the results of a detector that has been
forwarded in Refs. [17] and [18] to determine automati-
cally the waveform limits in Holter ECG).

A further inspection of Table I leads to the follow-
ing additional comment: When investigating the RR-
intervals alone (which can be detected automatically
more easily and precisely than the other intervals), i.e.,
studying νs(RR) and νL(RR), the vast majority of SD
(22 out of 24 cases) can be distinguished from H (only
two SD, i.e., sel30 and sel47, obey the corresponding H-
limits). Speciﬁcally, concerning νs(RR), 15 SD have val-

6

ues smaller than Hmin = 1.18, while only one SD (i.e.,
sel43) has a value exceeding Hmax = 2.25; as for νL(RR),
18 SD exceed Hmax = 0.77, while only 2 SD (i.e., sel34
and sel42) have values smaller than Hmin = 0.44.

In what remains, we proceed to a tentative physi-
cal interpretation of the above results, the main feature
of which focuses on the fact that most SD simultane-
ously have νs(RR)-values smaller than Hmin(= 1.18)
and νL(RR)-values exceeding Hmax(= 0.77). The RR
time-series of healthy subjects are characterized by high
complexity (e.g., [15, 19]); this, if we recall that in a
Markovian series we intuitively expect δSshuf /δS = 1
(and hence νs = 1 and νL = 1), is compatible with the
fact that in all H both νs(RR) and νL(RR) distinctly dif-
fer from unity (see Table I). We now turn to SD by con-
sidering that for individuals at high risk of sudden death
the fractal physiological organization (long range corre-
lations) breaks down and this is often accompanied by
emergence of uncorrelated randomness (see [15] and ref-
erences therein). It is therefore naturally expected that
in SD the values of νs(RR) and νL(RR) become closer
to the Markovian value (i.e., unity) compared to H; thus,
in SD, νs(RR) naturally becomes smaller than the value
1.18 (the corresponding Hmin-limit) and νL(RR) larger
than 0.77 (the corresponding Hmax-limit).

We now focus on the following important property
of H: although both νs(RR) and νL(RR) diﬀer from
unity, as mentioned, they systematically behave diﬀer-
ently, i.e., νs(RR) > 1 while νL(RR) < 1. The exact
origin of the latter diﬀerence has not yet been identi-
ﬁed with certainty, but the following comments might
be relevant: First, in the frame of the frequency-domain
characteristics of heart rate variability (e.g., [20]), we
may state that νs(RR) and νL(RR) are associated with
the high-frequency (HF, 0.15-0.4 Hz) and low-frequency
(LF, 0.015-0.15 Hz) range in the RR tachogram (“in-
stantaneous” heart rate,1/RR). An important diﬀerence
on the eﬀect of the sympathetic and parasympathetic
modulation of the RR-intervals has been noticed (e.g.,
see [20] and references therein): Sympathetic tone is
believed to inﬂuence the LF component whereas both
sympathetic and parasympathetic activity have an ef-
fect on the HF component (recall that our results show
νs(RR) > νL(RR)). Second, at short time scales (high
frequencies), it has been suggested [21] that we have rel-
atively smooth heartbeat oscillations associated with res-
piration (e.g., 15 breaths per minute corresponds to a
4 sec oscillation with a peak in the power spectrum at
0.25 Hz, see [20]); this is lost upon randomizing the con-
secutive intervals Qk, thus probably leading to (larger
variations -compared to the original experimental data-
between the durations of consecutive intervals and hence
to) δSshuf -values larger than δS, i.e., a νs(RR)-value
larger than unity (cf. an extension of the current analysis
to a surrogate sequence for a simultaneous recording of
the breath rate and the instantaneous heart rate, upon
considering the points discussed in paragraph 4.6 of Ref.
[5], could greatly contribute towards clarifying the valid-

ity of such an explanation). Such an argument, if true,
cannot be applied, of course, in the longer range 50-70
beats and hence explain why the opposite behavior, i.e.,
δSshuf < δS, then holds. The latter ﬁnding must be in-
herently connected to the nature itself of the long range
correlations. The existence of the latter is pointed out
from the fact that (in this range also) the RR-intervals re-

the long range correlations in the heart rate variability
has been independently established by several applica-

[15] and references therein).

∼

A simpliﬁed interpretation of the results of Fig.6, and
in particular the reason why for the QT intervals the
quantity δS is larger for the SD than for the H, could
be attempted if we consider that: (i) S could be thought
as a measure of the “disorder” (in the consecutive inter-
vals) (ii) the essence of the natural time-domain analy-

sis is built on the variation of the durations of consecu-
tive pulses, and (iii) it has been clinically observed (e.g.,
see Ref.[22]) that the QT interval (which corresponds to
the time in which the heart in each beat “recovers” -
electrically speaking- from the previous excitation) ex-
hibits frequent prolonged values before cardiac death.
Thus, when a time-window is sliding on an H-ECG, it
is intuitively expected to ﬁnd, more or less, the same
S-values (when sweeping through various parts of the
ECG) and hence a small δS-value is envisaged. By the
same token, in an SD-ECG, we expect that, in view of
the short-long-short sequences of the QT-intervals, the
corresponding S-values will be much diﬀerent (compared
to H), thus leading to a larger δS-value (cf. in the same
frame we may also understand why the σ/µ values -and
hence δSshuf , see Eq. (1)- are larger in SD than those
in H, as shown in Fig.6). The distinction between SD
and H could be also understood in the context of dy-
namic phase-transitions (critical phenomena), as follows:

VI. CONCLUSIONS

The N -dependence of Var(pk) is obtained from

In SD, since the dynamic phase transition (cardiac ar-
rest) is approached, the ﬂuctuations of S are expected
to become larger, thus reﬂecting larger δS; such intense
ﬂuctuations are not expected, of course, for H.

The main point emerged in the surrogate data analysis
presented in this paper, is the key-role of the quantity
δSshuf /δS. This ratio:

1. reveals the non-Markovianity in all three types of
signals analyzed here, i.e., SES activities, AN and ECG.
In a Markovian case we have δSshuf = δS, but the reverse
is not always valid; it may happen that δSshuf /δS = 1,
although δS- (and δSshuf -) value drastically diﬀer from
that of the Markovian (this is the case of ECG).

2. diﬀerentiates the ECG of healthy humans (H) from
those suﬀered from sudden cardiac death (SD). More pre-
cisely, in SD, the δSshuf /δS values of the RR (i.e. beat
to beat) intervals become closer to the Markovian value
(i.e., unity) compared to those in H. Furthermore, in SD,
both δS -and δSshuf - values of the QT interval ( corre-
sponding to the time in which the heart “recovers” from
its previous excitation) are larger than those in H.

As for the physical meaning of δSshuf in ECG, it was

shown to be a measure of σ/µ.

was used for the calculation of the sample variance of the syn-
thetic data, and thus N − 1 was replaced by N in Eqs.(A.8)
and (A.21).

The variance of the entropy Var(S) = (δS)2 can
then be found by adding and subtracting the terms

Expanding the square in Eq.(A.17), and using Eq.(A.14), we ﬁnd

If we assume that the distribution of Qk is skewnessless, i.e. E[(Qk

The right side of Eq.(A.20) becomes similar to Eq.(A.6), if we replace χq by χ ln(χ/m[K]e); thus after expanding the

A comparison of Eqs.(A.19) and (A.15) reveals the fol-
lowing: in order to ﬁnd the entropy ﬂuctuation δS, one
simply has to replace in Eq. (A.15) m[pk] with m[K]e

and then directly take its variance according to Eq.(A.9).
Equation (A.21) is just Eq.(1) of the main text.

On a quantitative method to analyse dynamical
and measurement noise

February 20, 2014

Abstract

This letter reports on a new method to analyse empirical time series of
a dynamical system with respect to the types of noise involved. Based on
experimental and numerically generated data we show that it is possible
to diﬀerentiate between dynamical and measurement noise. This method
is based on the theory of diﬀusion processes, it neither depends on further
assumptions, as the form of the process, nor on any parameters.

For scientiﬁc work it is of general importance to deduce properties of the
investigated system from measured data. In the past decades elaborated meth-
ods have been established to grasp diﬀerent properties of dynamical systems.
An important requirement is that these methods should be based on as little as
possible previous knowledge of the system.

Before 1980 complex systems were explained predominantly by stochastic
models. Then it became clear that many of these complex systems may be gen-
erated by low dimensional nonlinear systems. The nonlinear time series analysis
provides the tools for this point of view [1, 2]. Many methods exists to use the
nonlinear time series analysis to examine the underlying deterministics dynamic
also in noisy systems. To this end noise reduction is necessary and diﬀerent kinds
of methods exist to reduce noise as general as possible. It is important to no-
tice two diﬀerent kinds of noise: measurement noise which is not related to the
dynamics of the system and dynamical noise which interact with the dynamics
and hence forces the system. Therefore, in general a noise reduction has to
take into account the particular properties of noise. For hyperbolic systems the
shadowing Lemma allows to handle both kind of noise in a similar way. But
in general homoclinic tangencies exist and therefore the shadowing Lemma lose
validity and then especially dynamical noise causes problems [11, 12, 3].

On the other hand, dynamical noise is a part of the dynamics and therefore a
comprehensive knowledge of the system includes knowledge of the deterministic
part as well as knowledge of the stochastic part. The aim of stochastic modelling
is to ﬁnd the deterministic part and to determine the strength of the noise. For
this kind of view there exist many usefull methods [].

To sum up the previous points, if the kind of noise is known, then there exist

a lot of sophisticated methods to treat noisy systems.

1

Despite the diﬀerences mentioned between noise which does not interact
with the system dynamic and noise forcing the system’s dynamics, no tool exists
which clearly characterises the type of noise present for some data if the model
of the dynamic is not known [16, 10].

This letter is devoted to this problem. With the presented method it becomes

possible to characterize the noise involved in given data.

Thus the aim of our work is to present a method to indicate which kind of
noise is present. Based on the analysis of experimental data and of numerically
generated data we show that it is even possible to estimated the size of dynamical
and measuremant noise. [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].

In the following we consider linear or nonlinear dynamical systems with
perturbing noise. In principle two classes of noise excist, namely dynamical noise
which interacts with the system dynamics or measurement noise which does not
interact with the system dynamics itself. The ﬁrst case can be represented by
a Langevin equation (in the Itˆo representation),

j=1

[(D(2)(X, t))1/2]ij Γj(t), k = 1, . . . n

(1)

where X(t) denotes the time dependent n-dimensional stochastic state vector,
D(1), the so called drift coeﬃcient, represents the deterministic part of the dy-
namics, and [(D(2)(x, t))1/2]ij Γj(t) the stochastic part. D(2) is known as the
diﬀusion coeﬃcient and determines the strength of the noise, including the gen-
eral case of multiplicative noise. For the Langevin process Γj(t) is δ-correlated
Gaussian noise.

The measurement noise, which is typically inserted by the experimental mea-

suring process to the data, can formulated mathematically as

Yi(t) = Xi(t) + σiζi(t).

(2)

Now the observed/measured vector Yi is the sum of the state vector Xi, given
by the dynamics of equation (1), and δ-correlated measurement noise ζi with
standard deviation 1.

The structure of the paper is the following: Based on the mathematics of
diﬀusion processes we present the equation which allows to calculate the noise
level. To provide the evidends of this formula, we estimate the noise level from
diﬀerent kind of data. Our procedure here is based on the theory of diﬀusion
processes. It had been recently realized that using directly the deﬁnition of the
Kramers- Moyal coeﬃcient c.f. [4], it is possible to reconstruct the dynamics of
the Langevin equation [4, 13, 14]. Here the drift term D(1) is obtained as the
limit of conditional moments

(4)

where for numerical estimation the condition of the moments are approximated
by X(t)
U (x) for suﬃcient small neighborhood U . It is important to note,
that the conditional moments can be estimated directly from given data sets.
For small ∆t one get an equation connecting the diﬀusion coeﬃcient with the
ﬁrst two moments M (i) (i = 1, 2) [17]:

The successful application of these equation to estimate D(2)
ij were presented
in [4, 13, 14]. If in addition to the dynamic noise also measurement noise is
present, as deﬁned in (2), the moment M (2) changes to

Here σi denotes the standard deviation of the measurement noise. This equation
is valid for levels of measurement noise provided M (1)

ment noise.

Based on these features we analyse the following data. First experimental
data of a chaotic electronic oscillator are investigated. As circuitry we chose
the Shinriki oscillator [15] as shown in ﬁg. 1. In ﬁg. 2 exemplary phase space
representations of the attractors are shown. Fig. 2a) shows the chaotic dynamics
with dynamical noise, whereas in ﬁg. 2b) the trajectories of the chaotic dynamics
with dynamical and measurement noise is shown. As numerical system the

·

Additional measurement noise with diﬀerent amplitudes was added to the
numerically generated data. For the Shinriki oscillator we choose the state
component X1, for the Lorenz oscillator we choose the state component X2 to
add measurement noise.

To give evidence of the validity of our procedure, we show in Fig. 3 the
reconstructed deterministic part of (8). Here the one dimensional cut through
the three dimensional D(1) vector has been choosen in such a way that the ﬁfth
order nonlinearity becomes obvious. The reconstructed values are compared
with the measured characteristics of the corresponding electronic elements.

Next we investigate the noise describing term D(2). According to equation
(7) we calculate K (2)(∆t) in small neighbourhoods U . To improve the statistic,
we calculate the median of K (2)(∆t) about the whole state space assuming
additiv noise. As shown in ﬁg. 4 the moments K (2) display a linear dependence
on small ∆t. The strength of the dynamical noise D(2) is given by the slope.
Most remarkably K (2) shows an increasing oﬀ-set in the approximation for small
∆t as the measurement noise was increased. The value of K (2)(x, ∆t = 0)
coincides within 10% mistake to the expected values of the measurement noise
(table 2).

A further important consequence of this method should be noted. In the case
of purely dynamical noise, the knowledge of D(1) and D(2) enables to reconstruct
the noisy part of the dynamics (??). From this it can be quantiﬁed whether the
noise is δ-correlated or not.

Thus we conclude, based on the well known theory of diﬀusion processes and
especially based on the estimation of the Kramers-Moyal coeﬃcients we are able
to show what kind of noise is present in some given time series. The method
presented here does not depent any any preknowledge on the underlying non-
linear deterministic dynamics. Furthermore no parameters must be estimated.
Thus we think that our procedure is a good completion to [?].

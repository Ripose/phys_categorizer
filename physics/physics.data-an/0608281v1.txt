Abstract

Continuous time random walks (CTRWs) are used in physics to model anoma-
lous diﬀusion, by incorporating a random waiting time between particle jumps. In
ﬁnance, the particle jumps are log-returns and the waiting times measure delay be-
tween transactions. These two random variables (log-return and waiting time) are
typically not independent. For these coupled CTRW models, we can now compute
the limiting stochastic process (just like Brownian motion is the limit of a simple
random walk), even in the case of heavy tailed (power-law) price jumps and/or
waiting times. The probability density functions for this limit process solve frac-
tional partial diﬀerential equations. In some cases, these equations can be explicitly
solved to yield descriptions of long-term price changes, based on a high-resolution
model of individual trades that includes the statistical dependence between waiting
times and the subsequent log-returns. In the heavy tailed case, this involves oper-
ator stable space-time random vectors that generalize the familiar stable models.
In this paper, we will review the fundamental theory and present two applications
with tick-by-tick stock and futures data.

Continuous time random walk (CTRW) models impose a random waiting time
between particle jumps. They are used in statistical physics to model anoma-
lous diﬀusion, where a cloud of particles spreads at a rate diﬀerent than the
classical Brownian motion, and may exhibit skewness or heavy power-law tails.
In the coupled model, the waiting time and the subsequent jump are depen-
dent random variables. See Metzler and Klafter [15,16] for a recent survey.
Continuous time random walks are closely connected with fractional calculus.
In the classical random walk models, the scaling limit is a Brownian motion,
and the limiting particle densities solve the diﬀusion equation. The connection
between random walks, Brownian motion, and the diﬀusion equation is due
to Bachelier [1] and Einstein [5]. Sokolov and Klafter [26] discuss modern ex-
tensions to include heavy tailed jumps, random waiting times, and fractional
diﬀusion equations.

In Econophysics, the CTRW model has been used to describe the movement
of log-prices [7,9,18,19,20]. An empirical study of tick-by-tick trading data for
General Electric stock during October 1999 (Figure 1, left) in Raberto, et al.
[18] uses a Chi-square test to show that the waiting times and the subsequent
log returns are not independent. These data show that long waiting times
are followed small (in absolute value) returns, while large returns follow very
short waiting times. This dependence seems intuitive for stock prices, since
trading accelerates during a time of high volatility [4]. LIFFE bond futures
from September 1997 (Figure 1, right) show a diﬀerent behavior, where long
waiting times go with large returns. See [18] for a detailed description of the
data. In both cases, it seems clear that the two variables are dependent. In
the remainder of this paper, we will describe how coupled continuous time
random walks can be used to create a high-resolution model of stock prices in
the presence of such dependence between waiting times and log-returns. We
will also show how this ﬁne scale model transitions to an anomalous diﬀusion
limit at long time scales, and we will describe fractional governing equations
that can be solved to obtain the probability densities of the limiting process,
useful to characterize the natural variability in price in the long term.

Let P (t) be the price of a ﬁnancial issue at time t. Let J1, J2, J3, . . . denote
the waiting times between trades, assumed to be nonnegative, IID random
variables. Also let Y1, Y2, Y3, . . . denote the log-returns, assumed to be IID. We
speciﬁcally allow that Ji and Yi are coupled, i.e., dependent random variables
for each n. Now the sum Tn = J1 +
+ Jn represents the time of the nth
· · ·
trade. The log-returns are related to the price by Yn = log[P (Tn)/P (Tn−1)]
and the log-price after n trades is Sn = log[P (Tn)] = Y1 +
+Yn. The number
of trades by time t > 0 is Nt = max
, and the log-price at time t
is log P (t) = SNt = Y1 +

The asymptotic theory of continuous time random walk (CTRW) models de-
scribes the behavior of the long-time limit. For more details see [3,12,13]. The
log-price log P (t) = SNt is mathematically a random walk subordinated to
a renewal process. If the log-returns Yi have ﬁnite variance then the random
walk Sn is asymptotically normal. In particular, as the time scale c
we
have the stochastic process convergence c−1/2S[ct] ⇒
A(t), a Brownian mo-
tion whose densities p(x, t) solve the diﬀusion equation ∂p/∂t = D∂2p/∂x2

tween trades have a ﬁnite mean λ−1 then the renewal theorem [6] implies
Sλt, and hence the CTRW scal-
that Nt ∼
ing limit is still a Brownian motion whose densities solve the diﬀusion equa-
tion, with a diﬀusivity proportional to the trading rate λ. If the symmetric
r−α for
mean zero log-returns have power-law probability tails P (
some 0 < α < 2 then the random walk Sn is asymptotically α-stable, and
c−1/αS[ct] ⇒
A(t) where the long-time limit process A(t) is an α-stable L´evy

Fig. 2. Coupled CTRW model for LIFFE futures using normal coupling variable
(left) produces limit densities (right) from equation (1) for t = 0.5, 1.0, 3.0.

If the waiting times Ji and the log-returns Yi are coupled (dependent) then the
same process convergence holds, but now E(t) and A(t) are not independent.
Dependent CTRW models were ﬁrst studied by Shlesinger et al. [25] in order
to place a physically realistic upper bound on particle velocities Yi/Ji. They
set Yi = J β/α
i Zi where Zi is independent of Ji. In their example, they assume
that Zi are independent, identically distributed normal random variables, but
the choice of of Zi is essentially free [3]. Furthermore, any coupled model at
all for which (c−1/αS[ct], c−1/βT[ct])
(A(t), D(t)) will have one of two kinds
of limits: Either the dependence disappears in the limit (because the waiting
times Jn and the log-returns Yn are asymptotically independent), or else the
limit process is one of those obtainable from the Shlesinger model [3]. In the
former case, the long-time limit process densities are governed by the space-
time fractional diﬀusion equation of Zaslavsky [21,22,23]. In the remaining
case, the long-time limit process densities solve a coupled fractional diﬀusion

where Zi is normal [13]. In that case, the exact solution of this equation is

which describes the probability distributions of log-price in the long-time limit.
The resulting density plots are similar to a normal but with additional peaking
at the center, see Figure 2 (right).

As noted above, even if the waiting times and log-returns are dependent, it
is possible that the dependence disappears in the long-time limit. The rele-
vant asymptotics depend on the space-time random vectors (Tn, Sn), which
are asymptotically operator stable [11]. In fact we have the vector process
convergence (c−1/βT[ct], c−1/αS[ct])
(D(t), A(t)) and it is possible for the
component processes A(t) and D(t) of this operator stable L´evy motion to
be independent. The asymptotics of heavy tailed random vectors (or random
variables) depend on the largest observations [14] and hence the general situ-
ation can be read oﬀ Figure 1. When components are independent, the largest
observations cluster on the coordinate axes. This is because the rare events
that cause large waiting times or large absolute log-returns are unlikely to
occur simultaneously for both, in the case where these two random variables

are independent. Hence we expect a large value of one to occur along with a
moderate or small value of the other, which puts these data points far out on
one or the other coordinate axis. If the components are only asymptotically
independent, the same behavior will be seen on the scatterplot for the largest
outlying values, even though the two coordinates are statistically dependent.
This is just what we see in Figure 1 (left), and hence we conclude that for the
GE stock, the coupled CTRW model has exactly the same long-time behavior
as the uncoupled model analyzed previously [7].

The coupling Yi = J β/α
i Zi in the Shlesinger model implies that the longest
waiting times are followed by large log-returns. For the data set shown in
Figure 1 (right), it is at least plausible that the Shlesinger model holds. To
check this, we computed Zi = J
Yi for the largest 1000 jumps, following the
method of [24]. We estimated α = 1.97 and β = 0.95 using Hill’s estimator.
The “size” of the random vector (Ji, Yi) is computed in terms of the Jurek
distance r deﬁned by (Yi, Ji) = (r1/αθ1, r1/βθ2) where θ2
2 = 1 [14]. The
resulting data set Zi can be adequately ﬁt by a normal distribution (see Figure
2, left). Hence the Shlesinger model provides a realistic representation for the
coupled CTRW in this case. To address a slight lack of ﬁt at the extreme tails,
we also experimented with a centered stable with index 1.8, skewness 0.2, and
scale 0.08 (not shown), where the parameters were found via the maximum
likelihood procedure of Nolan [17]. For the stable model, the long-time limit
densities can be obtained by replacing the normal density in equation (1) with
the corresponding stable density.

In summary, we have shown that the coupled-CTRW theory can be applied to
ﬁnamcial data. We have presented two diﬀerent data sets, GE Stocks traded at
NYSE in 1999, and LIFFE bond futures from 1997. In both cases there is sta-
tistical dependence between log-returns and waiting time, but the asymptotic
behaviour is diﬀerent leading to diﬀerent theoretical descriptions.

monetarist experiment in the beginning of the 1980’s interest rates had a signiﬁcant long-range de-
pendence behavior. However, in the recent period, in the second part of the Volcker tenure and in the
Greenspan tenure, interest rates do not present long-range dependence behavior. These empirical
ﬁndings cast some light on the origins of long-range dependence behavior in ﬁnancial assets.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In the past decades the US economy has experienced
low inﬂation and little variation in real activity if com-
pared to the 1970’s. These improvements have been
largely attributed to a change in the way the Federal
Reserve conducts monetary policy. A number of research
papers have suggested that a structural break in the con-
duct of monetary policy has occurred since Paul Volcker
became chairman of the Federal Reserve in August 1979
(see Clarida et al., 2000).

However, there is little consensus as whether a change
in the conduct of monetary policy has indeed occurred
and if it has what would be the dates of these changes
(Boivin, 2005).

This paper adds to the debate on monetary policy by
studying changes in persistence in interest rates for dif-
ferent maturities for the US. We investigate 1, 3, 5 and
10 year maturity interest rates and present overwhelm-
ing evidence that a structural break has occurred in the
dynamics of these interest rates. We employ methods
recently developed in statistical physics and show that
interest rates’ persistence has decreased substantially in
the post-1982 period, while there is evidence of strong
long-range dependence in the pre-1982 period. There-
fore, the evidence in this paper is in line with the reason-
ing that a structural break has occurred in the conduct
of monetary policy in the early 1980’s.

This paper proceeds as follows. In section 2, a brief
review of the literature is presented.
In section 3, the
methodology to estimate generalized Hurst exponents is
reviewed. In section 4, the data used in this work is de-
scribed. Section 5 presents the empirical results. Finally,
in section 6, this paper is concluded.

II. BRIEF LITERATURE REVIEW

Researchers have documented a substantial change in
macroeconomic variables for the US in the past decades.

From the late 1960s through the early 1980s, the United
States economy experienced high and volatile inﬂation
along with several severe recessions. Since the early
1980s, however, inﬂation has remained steadily low, while
output growth has been relatively stable.

When Arthur Burns became chairman in February
1970, the inﬂation rate had reached nearly 6 percent, yet
almost immediately, monetary policy became more ac-
commodating in that the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee (FOMC) lowered the targeted federal funds rate and
money growth exploded. Over the period 1965 through
the end of the 1970s, monetary policy earned the appel-
lation stop-go from the FOMCs alternate concentration
on reducing inﬂation and stimulating economic activity.
The initial period of Volcker’s tenure as chairman, Au-
gust 1979 through 1982, can be thought of as the ﬁnal
stop phase of the preceding stop-go period. In that pe-
riod the Federal Reserve announced a change in operat-
ing procedures from partially targeting interest rates to
targeting nonborrowed reserves. This period, from Oc-
tober 1979 to August 1982, is known as the monetarist
experiment.

In 1982 the Volcker Federal Reserve began targeting
the fed-funds rate. From the mid-1980s onward, mone-
tary policy consistently responded strongly to inﬂation
and weakly to real-activity. This interest-rate targeting
continued in the Greenspan administration.

Romer and Romer (2003) study why monetary policy
has been so much successful under some Federal Reserve
chairmen than others. The authors argue that the key
determinants of policy success have been policymakers
views about the economy and limitations of monetary
policy.

Several papers have documented that a change in mon-
etary policy has occurred in the early 1980’s. Clarida
et al.
(2000) provide empirical evidence of important
changes in the U.S. conduct of monetary policy over the
last forty years. In particular they ﬁnd that while mon-
etary policy accommodated inﬂation in the 1970s, this
drastically and suddenly changed with the appointment
of Volcker in 1979. They emphasize that the pre-Volcker

conduct of monetary policy did not satisfy the so-called
Taylor principle, so that a given increase in inﬂation was
typically associated with a smaller increase in the nomi-
nal interest rate. The authors show that in the Volcker-
Greenspan era the Federal Reserve adopted a proactive
stance toward controlling inﬂation. Duﬀy and Engle-
Warnick (2004) study changes in monetary policy over
the 1995-2003 period and ﬁnd evidence o three structural
breaks, one of them in the beginning of the Volcker’s Fed-
eral Reserve chairmanship[25].

The literature cited above has discussed whether and
when structural breaks have occurred in the conduct of
monetary policy. The overall conclusion is that changes
have occurred in the dynamics of inﬂation and real ac-
tivity. Therefore, we will study the dynamics of interest
rates (long memory) and test whether changes have oc-
curred in the dynamics of these variables evaluating dif-
ferent time periods, according to hypothesized changes
in monetary policy and Federal Reserve chairman.

The ﬁrst to consider the existence of long memory in
interest rates seems to be Backus and Zin (1993) who
ﬁnd evidence of long-memory in the 3-month zero-coupon
rate for the US, and that allowing for long memory in the
short interest rate improves the ﬁtted mean and volatility
yield curves. The authors have suggested that the sources
of the long-memory property of the short-term interest
rate may be derived from a fractionally integrated dy-
namic for inﬂation and/or the money growth rate.

Since then, others have supported Backus and Zin
(1993) results. For example, Tsay (2000) has showed
that the ex post real interest rate for the US possesses
long memory. The author employed unit root tests due
to Kwiatkowski et al.
(1992) and Phillips and Perron
(1988). For most of the samples the authors analyzes
the rejection of both hypothesis suggest that these pro-
cess are neither an I(1) or I(0) process. Therefore, an
ARFIMA model was estimated and empirical evidence
suggested that ex post real interest rates could be well de-
scribed by an ARFIMA model with long memory. Other
evidences are provided by Barkoulas and Baum (1998)
employing spectral regression and Gaussian semipara-
metric methods to the Euroyen deposit rates and Eu-
royen term premium and McCarthy et al.
(2004) ap-
plying wavelets to a large class of US debt instruments.
In particular,the authors in Cajueiro and Tabak (2005a)
have found an interest evidence of this phenomenon
studying the long-range dependence behavior of the term
structure of interest rates in Japan where the predictabil-
ity in the term structure of interest rates increases with
maturity. In their paper this phenomenon is explained
by the nonnegative constraint in the interest rate.

The contribution of this paper is that we study long
memory properties for interest rates for diﬀerent time pe-
riods and check whether a structural break has occurred,
which is suggestive of changes in monetary policy.

III. MEASURES OF LONG-RANGE
DEPENDENCE

Several methods have been introduced to take the long-
range dependence phenomenon into account[26]. This lit-
erature can be actually divided in two diﬀerent strands:
(1) an approach whose focus is to determine the parame-
ter known as the Hurst exponent or a parameter related
to it (see, for example Geweke and Porter-Hudak (1983),
Hosking (1981), Hurst (1951), Robinson (1995) and Ca-
jueiro and Tabak (2005b)) and (2) an approach that aims
at developing statistics to test, through a hypothesis test,
the presence of long-range dependence (see, for example,
Giraitis et al. (2003), Lee and Schmidt (1996) and Lo
(1991)).

In this paper, our measure of long range dependence is
the Generalized Hurst exponent introduced in Barabasi
and Vicsek (1991) and considered recently by Di Mat-
teo et al.
(2005) to study the degree of development
of ﬁnancial markets. The generalized Hurst exponent
is a generalization of the approach proposed by Hurst.
The authors suggests analyzing the q-order moments of
the distribution of increments, which seems to be a good
characterization of the statistical evolution of a stochas-
tic variable X(t),

Kq(τ ) =

h|X(t + τ ) − X(t)|qi
h|X(t)|qi

,

where the time-interval τ can vary[27]. The generalized
Hurst exponent can be deﬁned from the scaling behavior
of Kq(τ ), which can be assumed to follow the relation

IV. DATA

The data is sampled daily, beginning on January 2,
1962 and ending on February 4, 2005. The full sample
has 10755 observations, collected from the Federal Re-
serve System. We study the 1,3 ,5 and 10-years to matu-
rity interest rates, which are constant maturity treasury
rates.

We test for long-range dependence in log interest rates
for diﬀerent time periods. We split the sample according
to monetary policy and also to Federal Reserve tenure.
Table 1 presents the tenure period for each chairman. We
do not study the Miller administration because it was too
short.

V. EMPIRICAL RESULTS

Recent research has documented that a change may
have occurred in the way monetary policy has been con-
ducted in the US in the past decades (see Clarida et al.,

2000, and Boivin, 2004). Therefore, we study the behav-
ior of interest rates for diﬀerent maturities and compare
generalized Hurst exponents for a variety of time periods.
Table 2 presents generalized Hurst exponents for diﬀer-
ent time periods. Panel A presents estimates according
to Federal Reserve chairman. Hurst exponents are de-
creasing with maturity, which suggests that short-term
interest rates are more predictable than long-term inter-
est rates. It is striking that these Hurst exponents are
close to 0.5 for the Greenspan era for all maturities, and
are very high for the Burns era (above 0.62 for all matu-
rities).

We would also like to test whether there is an inﬂuence
of the monetarist experiment conducted in the beginning
of the Volcker administration. Panel B shows results di-
viding the sample in a diﬀerent way. We see that interest
rates were quite persistent in the monetarist experiment
in the beginning of the Volcker administration. How-
ever, they converge to values similar to the ones seen in
the Greenspan administration afterwards.

The empirical results obtained suggest that the dy-
namics of interest rates has changed substantially in the

3

past decades. Long-range dependence seems to be strong
in the pre-1982 period, while this evidence practically dis-
appears in the recent period (post-1982), coinciding with
substantial changes in the conduct of monetary policy.
VI. CONCLUSIONS

Testing for long-range dependence in asset prices has
been subject of intense investigation in the ﬁnancial liter-
ature. There are many implications for portfolio and risk
management. For example, traditional option pricing
models should be modiﬁed to incorporate long-range de-
pendence features in asset prices and volatility. Further-
more, if the long-range dependence parameters change
over time, then the time series that are being studied
possess more information than is given by monofractal
models. Therefore, studies that focus on how and why
long-range parameters change over time may be particu-
larly useful as they can be used to determine structural
breaks or shifts in these time series.

This paper oﬀers a fresh look at the properties of in-
terest rates for the US. The empirical evidence suggests
that interest rates had strong long memory in the pre-
Volcker administration and that after 1982 this evidence
has disappeared. These results suggest a structural break
in the dynamics of interest rates. They also imply that
careful should be taken when studying long time series as
the parameters that characterize them may change over
time, which is evidence of multifractality.

It is important to notice that our sample period in-
cludes important changes in the macroeconomic envi-
ronment, as exchange rates become ﬂexible in the mid
1970’s and early 1980’s. Therefore, in a ﬁxed exchange
rate framework shocks to the economy must be absorbed
mainly by movements in interest rates, which implies in
more persistent interest rates’ dynamic. However, in ﬂex-
ible exchange rate regimes policy makers have more de-
grees of freedom to absorb shocks into the economy, as
exchange rates may absorb partially such shocks.

ior in the 1970’s and 1980’s.

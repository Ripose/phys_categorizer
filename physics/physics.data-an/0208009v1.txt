Interdependencies between experimental spectra, representing line or plane projections of elec-
tronic densities, are derived from their consistency and symmetry conditions. Some additional
relations for plane projections are obtained by treating them as line projections of line projections.
The knowledge of these dependencies can be utilised both for an improvement of experimental
data and for a veriﬁcation of various techniques used for correcting e.g. two-dimensional (or one-
dimensional) angular correlation of annihilation radiation spectra and Compton scattering proﬁles.

INTRODUCTION

All spectra, representing projections of the same den-
sity, must be interdependent. This so-called consistency
condition (CC ) has been considered for reconstructing
densities ρ(p) from their line projections [1-3]. In the case
of angular correlation of annihilation radiation (ACAR)
spectra or Compton proﬁles (CP) measurements this con-
dition is satisﬁed if spectra are measured up to such a
momentum pmax above which ρ(p) is isotropic and all
projections have the same values.

The CC is automatically imposed on the experimen-
tal data via the reconstruction of ρ(p). However, it can
be utilised for checking (before the reconstruction) if data
were measured and next corrected (to remove various ex-
perimental imperfections) properly. Moreover, this con-
dition can be also proﬁtable for an improvement of such
experimental data for which ρ(p) is not reconstructed.
For this purpose one should estimate interdependences
between projections what is a subject of this paper.

In the next Section we discuss the consistency condi-
tion in its general form, i.e.
for the Radon transform
in N-dimensional space. Next, some relations between
line (Sec. II.A) and plane projections (Sec. II.B) are de-
rived from both the CC and a symmetry of ρ(p) (elec-
tronic densisty in the momentum space) for various crys-
tallographical structures. A fulﬁlment of these relations,
proved for various model and experimental spectra, is
discussed in Sec. III.

II. THEORY

The Radon transform [4] represents integrals of ρ(p)
(deﬁned in N -dimensional space, RN ) over (N − 1)-
dimensional hyperplanes:

ˆR · ρ(p) = g(t, ζ) =

ρ(p)δ(t − ζ · p)dp,

(1)

∞

Z

−∞

where ζ is a unit vector in RN along t and t is a per-
pendicular distance of the hyperplane from the origin of

the coordinate system. The equation t = ζ · p deﬁnes the
hyperplane. In the same coordinate system the vector p
is described by p = |p| and ω (e.g. Dean [5]).

Both functions, g and ρ, can be expanded into spherical

harmonics of degree l:

g(t, ζ) =

glν(t)Slν (ζ),

ρ(p, ω) =

ρlν(p)Slν (ω),

where index ν distinguishes harmonics of the same order
l. In order to make our formuale clearer, henceforth index
ν will be omitted, keeping in mind that for the same l a
few harmonics can be used. According to Dean [5],

ρl(p) =

g(2µ+1)

where c = (−1)2µ+1Γ(l + 1)Γ(µ)/(2πµ+1Γ(l + 2µ)). Here
g(n) denotes the nth derivative of g ; Cµ
l are Gegenbauer
polynomials and µ = N/2 − 1. The equation (4) can be
solved analitically if either [6]

gl(t) =

alk(1 − t2)λ−1/2Cλ

l+2k(t),

with λ > N/2 − 1, or [7]

gl(t) = e−t

blkHl+2k(t),

(6)

where Hm are the Hermite polynomials. Because in ρl(p)
all terms tn with 0 ≤ n < l are equal to zero, the lowest
term in gl is of order l. This property, called CC, follows
from the fact that functions gl (Eq.
(2)) are a linear
combination of g(t, ζ) which in turn are interdependent
being projections of the same density. Generally, one can
write

gl(t) =

clkWl+2k(t),

where Wn denotes an arbitrary orthogonal polynomial.
Below, considering the cases N = 2 (line projections)
and N = 3 (plane projections), we show that due to this
property of gl(t) (its minimal number of zeros) we can get
some interdependences between projections g(t, ζ). For
that it is necessary to expand them into a series of the
same (as in Eq. (7)) polynomials:

g(t, ζ) =

ck(ζ)W2k(t).

(8)

Xk=0

By combining Eqs. (2), (7) and (8) we can obtain some
relations between ck(ζ) as a function of ζ.
In the pa-
per, for calculating the coeﬃcients ck, the Chebyshev
polynomials and the Gaussian quadrature formulae were
applied.

A. Line projections

In the case of reconstructing ρ(p) from its line pro-
jections g(x, y) (measured in the apparatus systems
(x, y, z)), the reconstruction of the three–dimensional
(3D) density can be reduced to a set of reconstructions
of 2D densities (the Radon transform for N = 2) per-
formed, independently, on succeeding planes y = const.,
parallel each other. In order to describe all projections
in the same coordinate system (in which the symmetry
of both ρ(p) and measured spectra is deﬁned) the func-
tion g can be characterized in the polar system where
g(x, y) ≡ g(t, α). Here t and α denote the distance of the
integration line from the origin of the coordinate system
and its angle with respect to a chosen axis, respectively.
For the planes y = const., perpendicular to the axis of
the crystal rotation of the order |G|, Eq. (2) reduces to
the cosine series [8]:

g(t, α) =

gl(t) cos(lα),

(9)

∞

Xl

with l = i · |G| (l = 0, |G|, 2|G|, etc.). Here the an-
gle α, describing nonequivalent directions, is changing
between 0 ≤ α ≤ αG = π/|G|. Of course, to use the
symmetry most proﬁtably, a sensible choice is to select
the planes perpendicular to the main axis of the crystal
rotation (|G| = 4 or 6 for cubic and tetragonal or hexag-
onal structures, respectively) where αG is minimal, i.e.
the number of equivalent directions is maximal.

Knowing that l/2 ﬁrst coeﬃcients clk are equal to zero
(Eq. (7)), the equations (8) and (9) give the following
dependences between ck(α)

10. ck(α) = c0k, i.e. |G|/2 ﬁrst coeﬃcients ck(α) are the

same for all projections.

20. 2ck(αG/2) = ck(α) + ck(αG − α) for k ≤ |G|.

30. 2{ck(αG/4) + ck(3αG/4)} = ck(α) + ck(αG/2 − α) +

ck(αG/2 + α) + ck(αG − α) for k ≤ 2|G|.

All these conditions have been proved for both various
models of ρ(p) and for |G| = 2, 4 and 6.

B. Plane projections

Due to the symmetry of ρ(p), in the case of N = 3,
g(t, ζ) ≡ g(t, Θ, ϕ) can be expanded into the lattice
harmonics Fl(Θ, ϕ) which form an orthogonal set of
linear combinations of the spherical harmonics K m
l =
c(l, m)P |m|
(cos Θ)(eimϕ + e−imϕ). c(l, m) is the normal-
ization constant and P |m|
(cos Θ) denotes the associated
Legendre polynomial. Angles (Θ, ϕ) describe the az-
imuthal and the polar angles of the ζ-axis with respect
to the reciprocal lattice system.

F6 = 0.35355338K 0
6 − 0.9354134K 4
6.
So, for the hexagonal and tetragonal structures a few
ﬁrst lattice harmonics do not depend on ϕ. Moreover,
very often, for some paticular sets of measured spectra,
we cannot calculate functions gl(t) (the matrix in Eq. (2)
is singular). For example: if for the hexagonal structure
we have only three projections with ζ along the ΓM ,
ΓK and ΓA symmetry directions (Fig. 1), the angles
(Θ, ϕ) are equal to: (π/2, π/6), (π/2, 0) and (0, 0), re-
spectively. Thus, the ﬁrst three lattice harmonics have
the same values for the ΓM and ΓK directions and there
is no a possibility to evaluate functions gl(t). Next, if e.g.
(Θ, ϕ) = (0, 0), (π/4, 0), (π/2, 0), (π/4, π/6), (π/2, π/6),
the set of equations for gl does not have a solution in
spite of the fact that the ﬁrst ﬁve harmonics distinguish
here all directions ζ. Due to these reasons we propose
to treat plane projections of ρ(p) as line projections of
˜ρL and to use the consistency and symmetry conditions
derived in Sec. II.A.

We consider only those spectra g(t, ζ) for which ζ is
changed on the plane perpendicular to the axis of the
crystal rotation of the order |G|. In such a case ˜ρL de-
notes the line integral of ρ(p) along lines L parallel to
this axis and g(t, ζ) can be described by Eq.(9). Now
all relations obtained for the line projections are valid
with ck(α) being replaced by ck(ζ) ≡ ck(Θ, ϕ) where ei-
ther α = ϕ and Θ = π/2 (for the planes perpendicular
to the main axis of the crystal rotation) or α = Θ and
ϕ = const. (for the planes with |G| = 2, perpendicular
to the previous ones).

For example,

for three spectra having the hexago-
nal symmetry and with ζ along the ΓM , ΓK and ΓA
symmetry directions (denoted here by g(ΓM ), g(ΓK)
and g(ΓA)) we have the following relations: ck(ΓM ) =

ck(ΓK) for k = 0, 1, 2 (here |G| = 6) and c0(ΓA) =
c0(ΓM ) = c0(ΓK) (|G| = 2), where c0 denotes the norm
of the spectrum. So, to get more information about
g(ΓA) we should have at least one additional spectrum
g(ΓI) (for Θ = π/4 and e.g. ϕ = 0) on the plane
with |G| = 2 where 2c1(ΓI) = c1(ΓA) + c1(ΓK) (see
Fig. 1). This equality is satisﬁed for Θ = π/4 and any
ϕ ∈ (0, π/6), i.e. 2c1(ΓI ′′) = c1(ΓA) + c1(ΓN ), where
the ΓN and ΓI ′′ directions are deﬁned by the same ϕ
with Θ = π/2 and Θ = π/4, respectively. Knowing that
c1(ΓN ) = c1 (does not depend on ϕ) we obtain that
c1(Θ = π/4, ϕ) has the same value for each spectrum
g(ζ) with ζ described by Θ = π/4 and any ϕ. This is
derived by treating g(ΓN ) simultaneously as the line pro-
jection of ˜ρ|6| and ˜ρ|2| with the symmetry |G| = 6 and
|G| = 2, respectively. Here ˜ρ|6| represents the line projec-
tion of ρ(p) along the main axis of the rotation, while ˜ρ|2|
along any line perpendicular to this axis. This last depen-
dence is particularly interesting because it gives interde-
pendence between line projections of diﬀerent densities,
while all consistency conditions for the line projections
are for the same ˜ρ.

All dependencies, shown here on the example of the
hexagonal structure, are valid for the cubic and tetrag-
onal structures where |G| = 6 is replaced by |G| = 4.
However, for the cubic structures, where three axes of
the fourth order exist, one can get some additional rules.
Because directions (Θ, ϕ) = (0, 0) and (π/2, 0) are equiv-
alent, we obtain that not only c0 but also c1 must be the
same for all projections. Some of these results can be also
derived from Eq. (2) because for the cubic structures all
lattice harmonics (except for F0) depend on (Θ, ϕ). Tak-
ing as an example directions [00h], [kl0] and [klh] we
obtain the following dependences between ci:

a1ci([00h]) + a2ci([kl0]) + a3ci([klh]) = 0 for i = 0, 1
b1ci([00h]) + b2ci([kl0]) + b3ci([klh]) = 0 for i = 0, 1, 2

where

bi =

ai = 0.

The above equalities arise from the conditions of van-
ishing all polynomials Wi with i = 0, 1 and i = 0, 1, 2
in the expansion of g4(t) and g6(t), respectively. The
coeﬃcient c1 satisﬁes both equations when c1([00h]) =
c1([kl0]) = c1([klh]) what is in agreement with the previ-
ous result. Knowing additionally that c1([kl0]) does not
depend on the direction [kl0], we can conclude that for
the cubic structure the value of c1([klh]) does not depend
on the direction (denoted here by [klh]).

As before, all relations were proved for both model
and experimental proﬁles. Some examples are presented
in the next section.

III. APPLICATION

First, disposing twenty ﬁve 2D ACAR experimental
spectra [10] for the four metals of the hcp structure with
ζ on the plane |G| = 6, we obtained that the conditions 10
and 20 are satisﬁed with a very high accuracy, lower than
0.5% (c1), 1.5% (c2), 1.5% (c3), 2.5% (c4) and 5.5% (c5).

Because the ﬁrst ckm(ζ) have the highest values, they are
determined the best (the inﬂuence of the statistical noise
is the lowest). This very small inconsistency implies that
spectra [10] (with the average number of counts at peak
about 60000) were not only measured but also corrected
with a very high precision.

In the ﬁgure 2 we show results for the theoretical
Compton proﬁles for Cr [11] with ζ along [100], [110]
and [111] directions. In this case (cubic structure) the
ﬁrst two coeﬃcients ck(ζ) should have the same value
for each spectrum, while the third coeﬃcient should sat-
isfy the relation: c[100] − c[110] = 3{c[110] − c[111]}.
After normalizing spectra to the same area (c0 = 1) we
obtained that a distortion of c1 from its average value
is changed from 0.1% up to 0.4% and the inconsistency
of c2 is of order 1.5%. Thus, the behaviour of ck(ζ) is
the same as for previously studied experimental data. It
is connected with the fact that in order to create such
spectra it would be necessary to calculate ρ(p) in the
whole momentum space p, what, of course, cannot be
done. Here the accuracy of calculating Compton proﬁles
was comparable with the statistical noise of 2D ACAR
data [10]. Of course, in order to get the similar inconsis-
tency of the Compton proﬁles (where a contribution of
core densities is much higher than in a positron annihila-
tion experiment) the experimental statistic must be also
much higher.

In order to examine how these conditions react to
an improper shape of g(t, ζ), we changed somewhat the
shape of one spectrum ( marked in ﬁgure 2 by squares).
Here we would like to point out that this incorrect spec-
trum does not diﬀer from other spectra too much (the
diﬀerences between g([100]) and g([111]) are higher). Af-
ter normalizing it to the same area (c0 = 1) we obtained
that c1 changed its value from -0.7 to -0.74 . So, here
we observe a much higher inconsistency (5%) than for
experimental data [10] (0.5%).

IV. CONCLUSIONS

All spectra received from experiments are contami-
nated by statistical noise and thus they are not consis-
tent. Depending on the number of measured projections,
some part of the inconsistent noise is eliminated via the
consistency conditions during the reconstruction of ρ(p).
However, we propose to check (before the reconstruction)
if spectra were measured and corrected properly (the in-
consistent part of the data cannot be too large). For
that purpose we can use the interdependences, derived
by combining the consistency and symmetry conditions,
obtained here for the line and plane projections.

The knowledge of the interdependences rules can be
also proﬁtable for an improvement of data for which den-
sities are not reconstructed (some part of the inconsistent
noise can be eliminated). Moreover, it can be applied
to verify these techniques which are used for correcting
Compton scattering spectra (they are not univocal and

can be individual for each spectrum [12]). For that we
propose to measure the high resolution CP, denoted usu-
ally by J(pz), for hexagonal metals with pz ≡ ζ changed
on the plane |G| = 6 (Θ = π/2). Having pz along ΓK
(ϕ = 0), ΓM (ϕ = π/6) and ΓN (ϕ = π/12), we can
check if ci(ΓK) = ci(ΓM ) = ci(ΓN ) for i = 0, 1, 2 and
if ci(ΓK) + ci(ΓM ) = 2ci(ΓN ) for i = 3, 4, 5. Of course,
the best choice is to study rare-earth metals where the
anisotropy of ρ(p) is so high that spectra J(pz) should
be essentionally diﬀerent.

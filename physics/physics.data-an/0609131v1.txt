We model information traﬃc on scale-free networks by introducing the node queue length L
proportional to the node degree and its delivering ability C proportional to L. The simulation gives
the overall capacity of the traﬃc system which is quantiﬁed by a phase transition from free ﬂow to
congestion. It is found that the maximal capacity of the system results from the case of the local
routing coeﬃcient φ slightly larger than zero, and we provide an analysis for the optimal value of φ.
In addition, we report for the ﬁrst time the fundamental diagram of ﬂow against density, in which
hysteresis is found, and thus we can classify the traﬃc ﬂow with four states: free ﬂow, saturated
ﬂow, bistable and jammed.

Complex networks can describe many natural and so-
cial systems in which lots of entities or people are con-
nected by physical links or some abstract relations. Since
the discovery of small-world phenomenon by Watts and
Strogatz [1], appeared in Nature in 1998, and scale-free
property by Barab´asi and Albert [2] one year later in Sci-
ence, complex networks have attracted growing interest
among physics community [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. As pointed
out by Newman, the ultimate goal of studying complex
networks is to understand how the network eﬀects in-
ﬂuence many kinds of dynamical processes taking place
upon networks [5]. One of the dynamical processes, traf-
ﬁc of information or data packets is of great importance
to be studied for the modern society. Nowadays we rely
greatly on networks such as communication, transporta-
tion, the Internet and power systems, and thus ensur-
ing free traﬃc ﬂow on these networks is of great signiﬁ-
cance and research interest. In the pass several decades, a
great number of works on the traﬃc dynamics have been
carried out for regular and random networks. Since the
increasing importance of large communication networks
with scale-free property such as the Internet [9], the traf-
ﬁc ﬂow on scale-free networks has drawn more and more
attention [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22].

Researchers have proposed some models to mimic the
traﬃc on complex networks by introducing the random
generation and the routing of packets [10, 11, 12, 13,
14, 15, 16]. Arenas et al. suggest a theoretical measure
to investigate the phase transition by deﬁning a quantity
[11], so that the state of traﬃc ﬂow can be classiﬁed to the
free ﬂow state and the jammed state, where the free ﬂow
state corresponds to the number of created and delivered
packet are balanced, and the jammed state corresponds
to the packets accumulate on the network.

Many recent studies have focused on two aspects to
control the congestion and improve the eﬃciency of trans-
portation: modifying underlying network structures or
developing better route searching strategies in a large
network [23]. Due to the high cost of changing the in-
In
frastructure, the latter is comparatively preferable.
this light, Wang et al. provide a traﬃc model in which
packets are routed based on local nearest-neighbour in-
formation [17, 18], and Yin et al. suggest a routing strat-
egy based on the local next-nearest-neighbour informa-
tion [19]. Yan et al. propose a eﬃcient routing strategy
to improve the transportation eﬃciency on complex net-
works based on the complete knowledge of the whole net-
work topology [20]. They ﬁnd that the eﬃcient path re-
sults in the redistributing traﬃc loads from central nodes
to other noncentral nodes and the network capability in
handling traﬃc ﬂow is improved more than 10 times by
optimizing the eﬃcient path.

However, previous studies usually assumed that the
capacity of each node, i.e., the maximum queue length of
each node for holding packets, is unlimited and the node
handling capability, that is the number of data packets
a node can forward to other nodes each time step, is
either a constant or proportional to the degree of each
node. But, obviously, the capacity and delivering ability
of a node are limited and variates from node to node in
real systems, and in most cases, these restrictions could
be very important in triggering congestion in the traﬃc
system.

Since the analysis on the eﬀects of the node capacity
and delivering ability restrictions on traﬃc eﬃciency is
still missing, we propose a new model for the traﬃc dy-
namics of such networks by taking into account the max-
imum queue length L and handling capacity C of each
node. The phase transition from free ﬂow to congestion
is well captured and, for the ﬁrst time, we introduce the
fundamental diagram (ﬂux against density) to character-
ize the overall capacity and eﬃciency of the networked
system. Hysteresis in such network traﬃc is also pro-

duced.

To generate the traﬃc network, our simulation starts
with the most general Barab´asi-Albert scale-free network
model which is in good accordance with real observation
of communication networks [3]. In this model, starting
from m0 fully connected nodes, one node with m links
is added at each time step in such a way that the prob-
ability Πi of being connected to the existing node i is
proportional to the degree ki of the node, i.e. Πi = ki
,
Σj kj
where j runs over all existing nodes.

The capacity of each node is restricted by two param-
eters: (1) its maximum packet queue length L, which is
proportional to its degree k (a hub node ordinarily has
more memory): L = α × k; (2) the maximum number of
packets it can handle per time step: C = β × L. Mo-
tivated by the previous models [10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18],
the system evolves in parallel according to the following
rules:

1. Add Packets - Packets are added with a given rate R
(packets per time step) at randomly selected nodes and
each packet is given a random destination.

2. Navigate Packets - Each node performs a local
search among its neighbors. If a packet’s destination is
found in its nearest neighborhood, its direction will be
directly set to the target. Otherwise, its direction will be
set to a neighboring node h with preferential probabil-
ity: Ph =
. Here the sum runs over the neighboring
nodes, and φ is an adjustable parameter. It is assumed
that the nodes are unaware of the entire network topol-
ogy and only know the neighboring nodes’ degree ki.

3. Deliver Packets – At each step, all nodes can deliver
at most C packets towards its destinations and FIFO
(ﬁrst-in-ﬁrst-out) queuing discipline is applied at each
node. When the queue at a selected node is full, the
node won’t accept any more packets and the packet will
wait for the next opportunity. Once a packet arrives at
its destination, it will be removed from the system. As
in other models, we treat all nodes as both hosts and
routers for generating and delivering packets.

h∆Npi
∆t

We ﬁrst simulate the traﬃc on a network of N = 1000
nodes with m0 = m = 5. To characterize the sys-
tem’s overall capacity, we ﬁrst investigate the incre-
ment rate η of the number of packets in the system:
η(R) = limt→∞
. Here ∆Np = Np(t + ∆t) − Np(t)
with h...i takes average over time windows of width ∆t.
Obviously, η(R) = 0 corresponds to the cases of free ﬂow
state, which is attributed to the balance between the
number of added and removed packets at the same time.
As R increases, there is a critical Rc at which Np runs
quickly towards the system’s maximum packet number
and η(R) increases suddenly from zero, which indicates
that packets accumulate in the system and congestion
emerges and diﬀuses to everywhere.

Hence, the system’s overall capacity can be measured
by the critical value of Rc below which the system can
maintain its normal and eﬃcient functioning. Fig.1 de-
picts the variation of Rc versus φ. The maximum over-

The capacity is characterized by the critical value of Rc for

at φ = 0.1 for α = 2 (b). The results are averaged from
10 simulations.

In the following, we provide an analysis for the opti-
mal value of φ corresponding to the peak value of Rc.
In the case of φ = 0, packets perform random-like walks
if the maximum queue length restriction of each node
is neglected. The random walk process in graph theory
has been extensively studied. A well-known result valid
for our analysis is that the time the particle spends at
a given node is proportional to the degree of such node
in the limit of long times [24]. Similarly, in the pro-
cess of packet delivery, the number of received packets
(load) of a given node averaging over a period of time is
proportional to the degree of that node. Note that the
packets delivering ability C of each node assumed to be
proportional to its degree, so that the load and deliv-
ering ability of each node are balanced, which leads to
a fact that no congestion occurs earlier on some nodes
with particular degree than on others. Since in our traf-
ﬁc model, an occurrence of congestion at any node will
diﬀuse to the entire network ultimately, no more easily
congested nodes brings the maximum network capacity.
However, taking the maximum queue length restriction
into account, short queue length of small degree nodes
make them more easily jammed, so that routing packets
preferentially towards large degree nodes slightly, i.e., φ
slightly larger than zero, can induce the maximum ca-
pacity of the system.

This also explain the diﬀerence in the position of Rmax
of Fig.1(a) and Fig.1(b). Comparing with the case of
α = 2, the small degree nodes are more easy to jam
when α = 1, so a greater φ is needed to achieve a more
eﬃcient functioning of the system. One can also conclude
that the optimal φ will be zero if α is large enough.

c

Then we simulate the packets’ travel time which is also
an important factor for measuring the system’s eﬃciency.
In Fig.2(a), we show the average travel time hT i versus

Average travel time hT i versus φ for R = 1, 2 and 5. The
data are truncated because the system jams when φ is either
too large or too small. (b) The variation of hT i versus R when
φ is ﬁxed. The data are also truncated when the system jams.

φ under the conditions of R = 1, 2 and 5. In the free-
ﬂow state, almost no congestion on nodes occurs and the
time for packets waiting in the node queue is negligible,
therefore, the packets’ travel time is approximately equal
to their actual path length in map. But when the system
approaches a jammed state, the travel time will increase
rapidly. One can see that when φ is slightly greater than
zero, the minimum travel time is obtained. In Fig.2(b),
the average travel time is much longer when φ is nega-
tive than it is positive. These results are consistent with
the above analysis that a maximum Rc occurs when φ is
slightly greater than zero. Or, in other words, this eﬀect
can also be explained as follows: when φ > 0, pack-
ets are more likely to move to the nodes with greater
degree (hub nodes), which enables the hub nodes to be
eﬃciently used and enhance the system’s overall capa-
bility; but when φ is too large, the hub nodes will more
probably get jammed, and the eﬃciency of the system
will decrease.

Finally, we study the fundamental diagram of net-
work traﬃc with our model. Fundamental diagram (ﬂux-
density relation) is one of the most important criteria
that evaluates the transit capacity for a traﬃc system.
Obviously, if the nodes are not controlled with the queue
length L, the network system will not have a maximum
number of packets it can hold and the packet density can
not be calculated, so that the fundamental diagram can
not be reproduced.
Interestingly, phase transition and
hysteresis phenomena can be observed in the fundamen-
tal diagram of our model.

To simulate a conservative system, we count the num-
ber of removed packets at each time step and add the
same number of packets to the system at the next step.
The ﬂux is calculated as the number of successful packet
delivered from node to node through links per step. In
Fig.3, the fundamental diagrams for φ = 0.0, 0.3, −0.5
and −0.7 are shown.

The curves of each diagram show four ﬂow states: free
ﬂow, saturate ﬂow, bistable and jammed. For simplic-
ity, we focus on the φ = 0.3 chart with the maximum
hF luxi = 1319 in the following description. As we can

FIG. 3: (color online). Fundamental diagram for a N = 1000
network with m0 = m = 5, α = 1, β = 0.2, and diﬀerent
φ. The data are averaged over 10 typical simulations on one
realization of network.
In each chart, the solid square line
shows the ﬂux variation when adding packets to the system
(increase density), while the empty circle line shows the ﬂux
variation when drawing out packet from the system (decrease
density). The sudden transition density values are: 0.26 and
0.23 (φ = 0.0), 0.40 and 0.34(φ = 0.3), 0.26 and 0.15(φ =
−0.5), 0.15 and 0.13(φ = −0.7). For diﬀerent realizations of
network, the fundamental charts are similar, but with small
diﬀerence in the transition values. The arrows in charts of
φ = 0.3 and −0.5 are showing the hysteresis for guide of eyes.

see, when the density is low (less than ≈ 0.10), all pack-
ets move freely and the ﬂux increases linearly with packet
density, which is attributed to a fact that in the free ﬂow
state, all nodes are operated below its maximum deliv-
ering ability C. Then the ﬂux’s increment slows down
and the ﬂux gradually comes to saturation (0.10 ∼ 0.34),
where the ﬂux is restricted mainly by the delivering abil-
ity C of nodes.

At the region of medium density, the model repro-
duces an important character of traﬃc ﬂow - “hysteresis”,
which can be seen that two branches of the fundamen-
tal diagram coexist between 0.34 and 0.40. The upper
branch is calculated by adding packets to the system,
while the lower branch is calculated by removing packets
from a jammed state and allowing the system to relax
after the intervention. In this way a hysteresis loop can
be traced (arrows in Fig.3), indicating that the system is
bistable in a certain range of packet density. As we know
so far, it is the ﬁrst time that the hysteresis phenomenon
is reported in the scale-free traﬃc system.

One can also notice that when φ = 0.3, the maxi-
mum saturated hF luxi is higher than others, and the
saturated ﬂow region is much boarder than the cases of
φ = 0.0, −0.5 and −0.7. All these results show that the
system can operate better when φ is slightly greater than
zero, which is also in agreement with the simulation re-

sult of Rc in Fig.1.

In order to test the ﬁnite-size eﬀect of our model, we
simulate some systems with bigger size. The simulation
shows similar phase transition and hysteresis in funda-
mental diagram as shown in Fig.4(a).

The ﬂux’s sudden drop to a jammed state from a
saturated ﬂow indicates a ﬁrst order phase transition,
which can be explained by the sudden increment of full
(jammed) nodes in the system (See Fig.4(b)). Accord-
ing to the evolutionary rules, when a given node is full,
packets in neighboring nodes can not get in the node.
Thus, the packets may also accumulate on the neighbor-
ing nodes and get jammed. This mechanism can trigger
an avalanche across the system when the packet density
is high. As shown in Fig.4(b), the number of full nodes
increase suddenly at the same density where the ﬂux drop
to zero and almost no packet can reach its destination.

As for the lower branch in the bistable state, starting
from an initial jammed conﬁguration, the system will
have some jammed nodes that are diﬃcult to dissipate.
Clearly, these nodes will decrease the system eﬃciency
by aﬀecting the surrounding nodes until all nodes are
not jammed, thus we get the lower branch of the loop.

In conclusion, a new model for scale-free network traf-
ﬁc is proposed to consider the nodes’ capacity and de-
livering ability. In a systemic view of overall eﬃciency,
the model reproduces several signiﬁcant characteristics
of network traﬃc, such as phase transition, and for the
ﬁrst time, the fundamental diagram for networked traﬃc
system. Inﬂuenced by two factors of each node’s capa-
bility and navigation eﬃciency of packets, the optimal
routing parameter φ is found to be slightly greater than
zero to maximize the whole system’s capacity. A special
phenomenon - the “hysteresis” - is also reproduced in the
typical fundamental diagram, indicating that the system
is bistable in a certain range of packet density. It is the
ﬁrst time that the phenomenon is reported in networked
traﬃc system. For diﬀerent packet density, the system
can self-organize to four diﬀerent phases: free-ﬂow, sat-
urated, bistable and jammed.

Our study may be useful for evaluating the overall eﬃ-
ciency of networked traﬃc systems, and the results may
also shed some light on alleviating the congestion of mod-
ern technological networks. With diﬀerent α and β, this
model may also be applied to other networks, such as
power grid and even urban traﬃc systems [8, 25].

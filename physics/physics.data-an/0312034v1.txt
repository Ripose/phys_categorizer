Volcano eruption forecast remains a challenging and con-
troversial problem despite the fact that data from volcano
monitoring signiﬁcantly increased in quantity and quality
during the last decades. This study uses pattern recognition
techniques to quantify the predictability of the 15 Piton de
la Fournaise (PdlF) eruptions in the 1988-2001 period using
increase of the daily seismicity rate as a precursor. Lead
time of this prediction is a few days to weeks. Using the
daily seismicity rate, we formulate a simple prediction rule,
use it for retrospective prediction of the 15 eruptions, and
test the prediction quality with error diagrams. The best
prediction performance corresponds to averaging the daily
seismicity rate over 5 days and issuing a prediction alarm
for 5 days. 65% of the eruptions are predicted for an alarm
duration less than 20% of the time considered. Even though
this result is concomitant of a large number of false alarms,
it is obtained with a crude counting of daily events that are
available from most volcano observatories.

1. Introduction

The eﬀective prediction success of volcanic eruptions is
rare if one deﬁnes “prediction” as a precise statement of
time, place, and ideally the nature and size of an impend-
ing activity [Minakami, 1960; Swanson et al., 1985; Voight,
1988; Tilling and Lipman, 1993; Chouet, 1996; Mcnutt,
1996]. A noteworthy obstacle is that most studies do not
quantify the eﬀectiveness and reliability of proposed pre-
dictions, and often do not surpass the analysis of a unique
success on a single case history with the lack of systematic
description of forecasting results.
In this study we focus
on rigorous quantiﬁcation of the predictive power of the in-
crease in the daily seismicity rate — a well-known and prob-
ably the simplest volcano premonitory pattern.

Following Minakami [1960], Kagan and Knopoﬀ [1987],
Keilis-Borok [2002], we do not consider here deterministic
predictions, and deﬁne a prediction to be “a formal rule
whereby the available observable manifold of eruption oc-
currence is signiﬁcantly contracted and for this contracted
manifold a probability of occurrence of an eruption is signif-
icantly increased” [Kagan and Knopoﬀ, 1987]. To quantify
the eﬀectiveness and reliability of such predictions we use
error diagrams [Kagan and Knopoﬀ, 1987; Molchan, 1997].
Previous attempts in probalistic forecast of volcanic erup-
tions used seismicity data in combination with other obser-

vations or alone [Minakami, 1960; Klein, 1984; Mulargia et
al., 1991, 1992]. These studies did not quantify the predic-
tion schemes in the error diagram framework. Minakami
[1960] was a pioneer in the development of seismic statistics
method for volcano monitoring. Based on the data from the
andesitic Asama volcano, Honshu, he uses the increase in
ﬁve-day frequencies of earthquakes to derive an increase in
the probability for an eruption in the next 5 days. Klein
[1984] tests the precursory signiﬁcance of geodetic data,
daily seismicity rate, and tides before the 29 eruptions dur-
ing 1959-1979 at the Kilauea volcano, Hawaii. He derives
a probabilistic prediction scheme that applies for eruptions
anywhere on the volcano and can give 1- or 30-days forecast.
The forecasting ability of daily seismicity rate is shown to
be better than random at 90% conﬁdence in forecasts on the
time scale of 1 or 30 days using small earthquakes that occur
in the caldera. A better performance is achieved with a 99%
conﬁdence when using located earthquakes only, in forecasts
on the time scale of 1 day. Mulargia et al. [1991, 1992] use
regional seimicity to deﬁne clusters of seismic events within
120 km distance of Etna volcano. Clusters within this re-
gional seismicity are found within 40 days before 9 out of
11 ﬂank eruptions in the 1974-1989 period. On the same
period no statistically signiﬁcant patterns are identiﬁed 40
days before and after the 10 summit eruptions.

As a test site we choose the PdlF volcano, the most active
volcano worldwide for the last decades with 15 eruptions in
the 1988-2001 period. On this site the volcanic risk remains
low because most of the eruptions are eﬀusive and occurred
in an area that is not inhabited. For the PdlF site, the in-
crease in seismicity rate and an increase in deformation rate
have been reported within a few hours prior to an eruption
(e.g. [Lenat et al., 1989; Grasso and Bachelery, 1995; Sapin
et al., 1996; Aki and Ferrazzini, 2000; Collombet et al., 2003;
Lenat et al., 1989; Cayol and Cornet, 1998]. Although the
deformation data are very eﬃcient to locate the lava outﬂow
vents from a few hours to minutes before the surface lava
ﬂow, there is not yet a long term catalog available to test
how they can be used to forecast an eruption days to weeks
in advance.

In this study we quantify the predictability of the PdlF
eruptions on the longer time scale of a few days to weeks prior
to an eruption. Collombet et al. [2003] show that accelerat-
ing seismicity rate weeks prior to the PdlF eruptions can be
recovered on average using the superposed epoch analysis
before numerous eruptions. Here we show that the increase
of the daily seismicity rate is useful as well to forecast indi-
vidual eruptions. This is achieved by rigorous quantiﬁcation
of the prediction performance by introducing error diagrams
[Kagan and Knopoﬀ, 1987; Molchan, 1997] to choose among
competitive prediction strategies.

GRASSO AND ZALIAPIN: VOLCANO PREDICTABILITY

During 1988-2001 period the seismicity at the PdlF site re-
mained low, with Mmax = 3.5, and was localized within a
radius of a few km beneath the central caldera. Less than
10% of these small events are located, most of them being
only recorded by the three summit stations located 3 km
apart from each other. Contrary to the Mauna Loa - Ki-
lauea volcanic system, there is no seismically active ﬂank
sliding or basal faulting on the PdlF. Contrary to the Etna
volcano, there is no tectonic interaction with neighboring
active structures. Accordingly, the PdlF seismicity is one of
the best candidates to be purely driven by volcano dynam-
ics. This seismogenic volume is also thought to be the main
path for the magma to ﬂow from a shallow storage system
toward the surface [Lenat and Bachelery, 1990; Sapin et al.,
1996; Bachelery, 1999; Aki and Ferrazini, 2000].

The PdlF seismicity catalog consists of data from the
16 seismic stations [Sapin et al., 1996; Aki and Ferrazzini,
2000]. During the May 1988- June 2001 period the geome-
try and instrumental characteristics of the seismic network
remained stable, with a magnitude detection threshold of
0.5 [Collombet et al., 2003].
In this period 15 eruptions
were seismically monitored. We use here the seismicity rate
of the volcano tectonic (VT) events, excluding long period
(LP) events or rockfall signals. The number of LP events at
the PdlF site is insigniﬁcant compared to the number of VT
events. For example, the eruption of 1998 was acconpanied
by a single LP event 4 hours before the surface lava ﬂow
[Aki and Ferrazzini, 2000], and 2500 VT events had been
recorded at that time.

3. Synthesis of seismicity pattern before
eruptions

Although the peaks of seismicity rate clearly correlate
with eruption days (see Figure 1 in [Collombet et al, 2003]),
it is diﬃcult to identify a long-term seismicity pattern before
each eruption, except possibly during the last few hours be-
fore surface lava ﬂow [Lenat et al., 1989; Sapin et al., 1996;
Aki and Ferrazzini, 2000; Collombet et al, 2003]. For all the
15 PdlF eruptions the hourly seismicity rate during the seis-
micity crisis that precedes each surface lava ﬂow is roughly
constant with values ranging from 60 to 300 events/hr, with
an average value of 120 events/hr. The average crisis dura-
tion is 4 hrs, the extreme values ranging from 0.5 hours for
the may 1988 eruption to 36 hours for the 1998 eruption.
No correlation is found between the seismic rates or the du-
rations of the crisis and the erupted volumes. Because there

is no recurrent migration of seismicity during these crises
[e.g. Sapin et al., 1996] we suggested, as proposed by Rubin
et al. [1998], that damage is neither directly related to the
dyke tip, nor does it always map the dyke propagation. It is
the response to dike intrusion of parts of the volcano ediﬁce
that are close to failure [e.g. Grasso and Bachelery, 1995].

We synthesize the pre-eruption seismicity rate on the
PdlF volcano as a 3 step process (Figure 1). First, the seis-
micity rate increases in average and it follows a power law
10-15 days prior the eruption [Collombet et al, 2003]. This
is reminiscent of the average foreshock patterns observed
for earthquakes [Jones and Molnar, 1979; Helmstetter and
Sornette, 2003]. As for earthquakes, we suggest that this
pattern illuminates a local damage process rather than a
macroscopic failure, the damage being localized within the
magma storage system a few km below the volcano [e.g.
Sapin et al., 1996]. This average acceleration is diﬀerent
from the acceleration proposed prior to each single eruption
by Voight [1988], or individual large earthquakes [e.g. Bufe
and Varnes, 1993]. The second phase is seismically mapped
by a discontinuity in seismicity rate from a peak value < 20
events/day to a > 2000 events/day constant rate (Figure 1).
We suggest it corresponds to the onset of the magma ﬂow
outward of the storage system. The third phase is char-
acterized by a constant strong seismicity rate during each
crisis. We suggest it corresponds to the damage induced by
ﬂuid ﬂow, either as a diﬀuse response to dyke propagation
in an heterogeneous rock matrix or as damage in the open
reservoir walls during ﬂuid ﬂow.

This pre-eruption scheme helps both to clarify the erup-
tion phases on the PdlF and to deﬁne our prediction targets.

time of surface lava ﬂow, then all the eruptions can be pre-
dicted a few hours in advance by choosing a daily seismicity
rate larger than 60 events/day as an alarm threshold. For
this threshold value the seismic crisis that did not end up in
an eruption are false alarms. They are post-labelled at the
observatory as intrusion, and are part of the endogeneous
growth of any volcano. We aim to ﬁnd precursory patterns
before the outward magma ﬂow from the reservoir system.
Accordingly, we deﬁne our target as the onset of a reser-
voir leak as mapped by the end of the average acceleration
process and before the onset of the eruption crisis (Figure
1). This target possibly maps a local failure in the reser-
voir walls, contemporary to the onset of outward magma
ﬂow from the reservoir, and corresponds to predicting erup-
tions more than one day in advance. Thus, our problem is
diﬀerent from that posed by Klein [1984].

4. Prediction scheme and error diagram

Here we follow a pattern recognition approach [e.g.
Gelfand et al., 1976] to predict rare extreme events in com-
plex systems; this approach is reviewed by Keilis-Borok
[2002]. To use pattern recognition techniques as a fore-
casting tool we deﬁne 3 steps in the data analysis. First
we consider a sequence of VT earthquake occurrence times
C = te : e = 1 , 2 , . . . E ; te ≤ te+1 . Note that we use neither
magnitude nor location of events. Second, on the sequence
C we deﬁne a function N (t, s) as the number of earthquakes
within the time window [t − s, t], s being a numerical pa-
rameter. This functional is calculated for the time interval
considered with diﬀerent values of numerical parameter s.
Third, an alarm is triggered when the functional N (t, s) ex-
ceeds a predeﬁned threshold N0. The threshold N0 is usually
chosen as a certain percentile of the distribution function for
the functional N (t, s). The alarm is declared for a time in-
terval ∆. The alarm is terminated after an eruption occurs
or the time ∆ expires, whichever comes ﬁrst. Our predic-
tion scheme depends on three parameters: time window s,
threshold N0, and duration ∆ of alarms. The quality of this
kind of prediction is evaluated with help of ”error diagrams”
which are a key element in evaluating a prediction algorithm
[Kagan and Knopoﬀ, 1987; Molchan, 1997].

The deﬁnition of an error diagram is the following. Con-
sider prediction by the scheme described above. We con-
tinously monitor seismicity, declare alarms when the func-
tional N (t, s) exceeds the threshold, and count the predic-
tion outcomes (Figure 2). During a given time interval T , N
targets occurred and NF of them were not predicted. The
number of declared alarms was A, with AF of them being
false alarms. The total duration of alarms was D. The
error diagram shows the trade-oﬀ between the relative du-
ration of alarms τ = D/T , the fraction of failures to predict
n = NF /N , and the fraction of false alarms f = AF /A. In
the (n, τ )-plane the straight line n + τ = 1 corresponds to
a random binomial prediction — at each step in time the
alarm is declared with some probability τ and not declared
with probability 1 − τ . Given a particular prediction that
depends on our three parameters (s, N0, ∆), diﬀerent points
in the error diagram correspond to diﬀerent values of these
parameters. Error diagrams thus tally the score of a predic-
tion algorithm’s successes and errors. This score depends on
the algorithm’s adjustable parameters. For example, raising
the threshold N0 will reduce the number of alarms A but
may increase the number NF of failures to predict. Raising
∆, on the other hand, will increase the duration alarms D
but may reduce the number of failures to predict NF , etc.
A prediction algorithm is useful if: (i) the prediction qual-
ity is better than that of a random one, i.e. the points on
error diagram are close to the origin and distant from the
diagonal n + τ = 1; and (ii) this quality is fairly insensitive
to changes in the parameters.

5. Results and Discussion

We estimate the time predictability of volcanic eruptions
based on the increase of the daily seismicity rate. The pa-
rameters of the algorithm are varied as follows: 1 < s < 30
days, 1 ≤ N0 ≤ 100 events per s days, 1 ≤ ∆ ≤ 30 days.
The 30 day limit is the minimum time between two eruptions
during 1988-2001. The best predictions are obtained when
averaging seismicity rate over a 5 day window and declaring
an alarm for 5 days. The predictive skills of our prediction
scheme are illustrated by the error diagrams of Figures (3,
4). Each point in the error diagram corresponds to diﬀerent
values of the threshold N0 ranging from 1 to 100 events per 5
days, other parameters are ﬁxed as s = 5 days, ∆ = 5 days.
Error diagrams outline the whole range of possible predic-
tion outcomes; thus they are more convenient for decision
making than performance of “the best” single version of pre-
diction. We observe for instance (Point A) that 65% of the
PdlF eruptions can be predicted with 20% of the time cov-
ered by alarms. These results are of the same quality as that
obtained on the Etna or the Hawaii volcanoes. For instance,
using regional seismicity in a 120 km radius from the Etna
volcano, 50% of the eruptions could have been predicted
within 40 days in the 1974-1990 period, which can be sorted
as 80 % of the 11 ﬂank eruptions, and no summit eruptions
[Mulargia et al., 1991, 1992]. Decreasing the threshold N0
yields an alternative prediction strategy that favors a lower
failure to predict rate and accepts a higher alarm duration
rate; it is shown as point B on Figure (3). The choice of
a particular prediction strategy must be always based on
the analysis of the entire error diagram; diﬀerent prediction
strategies may be used in parallel to complement each other
(see more in [Molchan, 1997; Zaliapin et al., 2003]).

It is worth noticing that the performance of our simple
prediction algorithm, which is based on mere averaging of
the seismicity rate, is close to the performance of much more
sophisticated algorithms that use numerous seismic param-
eters to predict large observed earthquakes [e.g. Kossobokov
et al., 1999]. The signiﬁcant predictability we obtain here is
still concomitant of a fraction of false alarm larger than 90%
(Figure 4). Because this predictability emerges from the use
of a daily seismicity rate only, we expect that a modiﬁca-
tion of the above prediction strategy to include earthquake
location and magnitudes with deformation and geochemistry
data will improve this ﬁrst quantitative analysis of eruption
prediction on PdlF.

Abstract

We introduce a model of proportional growth to explain the distribution P (g) of
business ﬁrm growth rates. The model predicts that P (g) is Laplace in the central
part and depicts an asymptotic power-law behavior in the tails with an exponent
ζ = 3. Because of data limitations, previous studies in this ﬁeld have been focus-
ing exclusively on the Laplace shape of the body of the distribution. We test the
model at diﬀerent levels of aggregation in the economy, from products, to ﬁrms, to
countries, and we ﬁnd that the its predictions are in good agreement with empirical
evidence on both growth distributions and size-variance relationships.

1 Introduction

Gibrat (1), building upon the work of the astronomers Kapteyn and Uven (2),
assumed the expected value of the growth rate of a business ﬁrm’s size to be
proportional to the current size of the ﬁrm (the so called “Law of Proportionate
Eﬀect”) (3; 4). Several models of proportional growth have been subsequently
introduced in economics to explain the growth of business ﬁrms (5; 6; 7). Simon
and co-authors (8; 9) extended Gibrat’s model by introducing an entry process
according to which the number of ﬁrms rise over time. In Simon’s framework,
the market consists of a sequence of many independent “opportunities” which
arise over time, each of size unity. Models in this tradition have been challenged
by many researchers (10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15) who found that the ﬁrm growth
distribution is not Gaussian but displays a tent shape.

Using a database on the size and growth of ﬁrms and products, we characterize
the shape of the whole growth rate distribution. Then we introduce a general
framework that provides an unifying explanation for the growth of business
ﬁrms based on the number and size distribution of their elementary constituent
components (16; 17; 18; 19; 20; 21; 22; 23; 15). Speciﬁcally we present a model
of proportional growth in both the number of units and their size and we
draw some general implications on the mechanisms which sustain business
ﬁrm growth (9; 6; 7; 19). According to the model, the probability density
function (PDF) of growth rates is Laplace in the center (10) with power law
tails (25). We test our model by analyzing diﬀerent levels of aggregation of
economic systems, from the “micro” level of products to the “macro” level of
industrial sectors and national economies. We ﬁnd that the model accurately
predicts the shape of the PDF of growth rate at any level of aggregation.

2 The Model

We model business ﬁrms as classes consisting of a random number of units. Ac-
cording to this view, a ﬁrm is represented as the aggregation of its constituent
units such as divisions (20), businesses (18), or products (19). We study the
logarithm of the one-year growth rate of classes g
log(S(t + 1)/S(t)) where
S(t) and S(t + 1) are the sizes of classes in the year t and t + 1 measured in
monetary values (GDP for countries, sales for ﬁrms and products). The model
is illustrated in Fig. 1. The model is built upon two key sets of assumptions:

≡

A) the number of units in a class grows in proportion to the existing number

of units;

B) the size of each unit grows in proportion to its size.

2

More speciﬁcally, the ﬁrst set of assumptions is:

(A1) Each class α consists of Kα(t) number of units. At time t = 0, there are

N(0) classes consisting of n(0) total number of units.

(A2) At each time step a new unit is created. Thus the number of units at

time t is n(t) = n(0) + t.

(A3) With birth probability b, this new unit is assigned to a new class.
(A4) With probability 1
probability Pα = (1

b, a new unit is assigned to an existing class α with
b)Kα(t)/n(t).

−

The second set of assumptions of the model is:

(A5) At time t, each class α has Kα(t) units of size ξi(t), i = 1, 2, ...Kα(t) where

Kα and ξi > 0 are independent random variables.

(A6) At time t + 1, the size of each unit is decreased or increased by a random

factor ηi(t) > 0 so that

ξi(t + 1) = ξi(t) ηi(t),

where ηi(t), the growth rate of unit i, is independent random variable.

Based on the ﬁrst set of assumptions, we derive P (K), the probability distri-
bution of the number of units in the classes at large t. Then, using the second
set of assumptions with P (K) we calculate the probability distribution of
growth rates P (g). Since the exact analytical solution of P (K) is not known,
we provide approximate mean ﬁeld solution for P (K) (see, e.g., Chapter 6
of (26)). We also assume that P (K) follows exponential distribution either in
old and new classes (27).

Therefore, the distribution of units in all classes is given by

P (K) =

Pold(K) +

Pnew(K).

(2)

N(0)
N(0) + bt

bt
N(0) + bt

where Pold(K) and Pnew(K) are the distribution of units in pre-existing and
new classes, respectively.

Let us assume both the size and growth of units (ξi and ηi respectively) are
distributed as LN(mξ, Vξ) and LN(mη, Vη) where LN means lognormal dis-
tribution. Thus, for large K, g has a Gaussian distribution

where m is the function of mη and Vη, and V is the function of Vξ and Vη.

The approximate solution of P (g) is obtained by using Eq. (3) for P (g
K) for
ﬁnite K, mean ﬁeld solution Eq. (2) for P (K) and replacing summation by
integration in Eq. (4). After some algebra, we ﬁnd that the the shape of P (g)
based on either Pold(K) or Pnew(K) is same, and P (g) is given as follows

3 The Empirical Evidence

We analyze diﬀerent levels of aggregation of economic systems, from the mi-
cro level of products to the macro level of industrial sectors and national
economies.

We study a unique database, the pharmaceutical industry database (PHID),
which records sales ﬁgures of the 189, 303 products commercialized by 7, 184
pharmaceutical ﬁrms in 21 countries from 1994 to 2004, covering the whole
size distribution for products and ﬁrms and monitoring the ﬂows of entry
and exit at both levels. Moreover, we investigate the growth rates of all U.S.
publicly-traded ﬁrms from 1973 to 2004 in all industries, based on Security
Exchange Commission ﬁlings (Compustat). Finally, at the macro level, we
study the growth rates of the gross domestic product (GDP) of 195 countries
from 1960 to 2004 (World Bank).

Figure 2a shows that the growth distributions of countries, ﬁrms, and products
seems quite diﬀerent but in Fig. 2b they are all well ﬁtted by Eq. (5) just with
diﬀerent values of V . Growth distributions at any level of aggregation depict
marked departures from a Gaussian shape. Moreover, while the P (g) of GDP
can be approximated by a Laplace distribution, the P (g) of ﬁrms and products
are clearly more leptokurtic than Laplace. Coherently with the predictions of
the model outlined in Section 2, we ﬁnd that both product and ﬁrm growth
distributions are Laplace in the body (Fig. 3), with power-law tails with an
exponent ζ = 3 (Fig. 4).

4 Discussion

We introduce a simple and general model that accounts for both the central
part and the tails of growth distributions at diﬀerent levels of aggregation in
economic systems. In particular, we show that the shape of the business ﬁrm
growth distribution can be accounted for by a simple model of proportional
growth in both number and size of their constituent units. The tails of growth
rate distributions are populated by younger and smaller ﬁrms composed of one
or few products while the center of the distribution is shaped by big multi-
product ﬁrms. Our model predicts that the growth distribution is Laplace in
the central part and depicts an asymptotic power-law behavior in the tails.
We ﬁnd that the model’s predictions are accurate.

Fig. 1. Schematic representation of the model of proportional growth. At time t = 0,
there are N (0) = 2 classes ((cid:3)) and n(0) = 5 units (
) (Assumption A1). The area
of each circle is proportional to the size ξ of the unit, and the size of each class is the
sum of the areas of its constituent units (see Assumption B1). At the next time step,
t = 1, a new unit is created (Assumption A2). With probability b the new unit is
assigned to a new class (class 3 in this example) (Assumption A3). With probability
b the new unit is assigned to an existing class with probability proportional to
1
the number of units in the class (Assumption A4). In this example, a new unit is
assigned to class 1 with probability 3/5 or to class 2 with probability 2/5. Finally,
at each time step, each circle i grows or shrinks by a random factor ηi (Assumption
B2).

Track ﬁnding and ﬁtting algorithm in the ALICE Time projection chamber (TPC) based on Kalman-ﬁltering
is presented. Implementation of particle identiﬁcation (PID) using dE/dx measurement is discussed. Filtering
and PID algorithm is able to cope with non-Gaussian noise as well as with ambiguous measurements in a
high-density environment. The occupancy can reach up to 40% and due to the overlaps, often the points along
the track are lost and others are signiﬁcantly displaced. In the present algorithm, ﬁrst, clusters are found and
the space points are reconstructed. The shape of a cluster provides information about overlap factor. Fast
spline unfolding algorithm is applied for points with distorted shapes. Then, the expected space point error is
estimated using information about the cluster shape and track parameters. Furthermore, available information
about local track overlap is used. Tests are performed on simulation data sets to validate the analysis and to
gain practical experience with the algorithm.

1. Introduction

Track ﬁnding for the predicted particle densities is
one of the most challenging tasks in the ALICE ex-
periment [1]. It is still under development and here
the current status is reported. Track ﬁnding is based
on the Kalman-ﬁltering approach. Kalman-like algo-
rithms are widely used in high-energy physics experi-
ments and their advantages and shortcomings are well
known.

There are two main disadvantages of the Kalman
ﬁlter, which aﬀect the tracking in the ALICE TPC
[2]. The ﬁrst is that before applying the Kalman-ﬁlter
procedure, clusters have to be reconstructed. Occu-
pancies up to 40% in the inner sectors of the TPC
and up to 20% in the outer sectors are expected; clus-
ters from diﬀerent tracks may be overlapped; there-
fore a certain number of the clusters are lost, and the
others may be signiﬁcantly displaced. These displace-
ments are rather hard to take into account. Moreover,
these displacements are strongly correlated depending
on the distance between two tracks.

The other disadvantage of the Kalman-ﬁlter track-
ing is that it relies essentially on the determination
of good ‘seeds’ to start a stable ﬁltering procedure.
Unfortunately, for the tracking in the ALICE TPC
the seeds using the TPC data themselves have to be
constructed. The TPC is a key starting point for the
tracking in the entire ALICE set-up. Until now, prac-
tically none of the other detectors have been able to
provide the initial information about tracks.

On the other hand, there is a whole list of very

attractive properties of the Kalman-ﬁlter approach.

• It is a method for simultaneous track recognition

and ﬁtting.

• There is a possibility to reject incorrect space
points ‘on the ﬂy’, during the only tracking pass.
Such incorrect points can appear as a conse-
quence of the imperfection of the cluster ﬁnder.

TULT011

They may be due to noise or they may be points
from other tracks accidentally captured in the
list of points to be associated with the track un-
der consideration. In the other tracking meth-
ods one usually needs an additional ﬁtting pass
to get rid of incorrectly assigned points.

• In the case of substantial multiple scattering,
track measurements are correlated and therefore
large matrices (of the size of the number of mea-
sured points) need to be inverted during a global
ﬁt. In the Kalman-ﬁlter procedure we only have
to manipulate up to 5 × 5 matrices (although
many times, equal to the number of measured
points), which is much faster.

• Using this approach one can handle multiple
scattering and energy losses in a simpler way
than in the case of global methods.

• Kalman ﬁltering is a natural way to ﬁnd the
extrapolation of a track from one detector to
another (for example from the TPC to the ITS
or to the TRD).

The following parametrization for the track was

chosen:

y(x) = y0 − 1
C
z(x) = z0 − tan λ
p
arcsin(Cx − η)
C

1 − (Cx − η)2

(1)

(2)

The state vector xT is given by the local track position
x, y and z, by a curvature C, local x0 position of the
helix center, and dip angle λ:

xT = (y, z, C, tan λ, η), η ≡ Cx0

(3)

Because of high occupancy the standard Kalman
ﬁlter approach was modiﬁed. We tried to ﬁnd max-
imum additional possible information which can be

2

the track projected onto the pad plane and pad-row is
relevant. For the measurement of the the drift coordi-
nate (z–direction) it is the angle β between the track
and z axis (ﬁg. 1).

The ionization electrons are randomly distributed
along the particle trajectory. Fixing the reference x
position of an electron at the middle of pad-row, the y
(resp. z) position of the electron is a random variable
characterized by uniform distribution with the width
La, where La is given by the pad length Lpad and the
angle α (resp. β):

La = Lpad tan α

The diﬀusion smears out the position of the electron
with gaussian probability distribution with σD. Con-
tribution of the E×B and unisochronity eﬀects for the
Alice TPC are negligible. The typical resolution in the
case of ALICE TPC is on the level of σy ∼ 0.8 mm
and σz ∼ 1.0 mm integrating over all clusters in the
TPC.

3. Center-of-gravity error parametrization

Detected position of charged particle is a random
variable given by several stochastic processes: diﬀu-
sion, angular eﬀect, gas gain ﬂuctuation, Landau ﬂuc-
tuation of the secondary ionization, E×B eﬀect, elec-
tronic noise and systematic eﬀects (like space charge,
etc.). The relative inﬂuence of these processes to the
resulting distortion of position determination depends
on the detector parameters. In the big drift detectors
like the ALICE TPC the main contribution is given
by diﬀusion, gas gain ﬂuctuation, angular eﬀect and
secondary ionization ﬂuctuation.

Furthermore we will use following assumptions:

• Nprim primary electrons are produced at a ran-
dom positions xi along the particle trajectory.

• ni − 1 electrons are produced in the process of

secondary ionization.

• Displacement of produced electrons due to the

thermalization is neglected.

Each of electrons is characterized by a random vec-

used during cluster ﬁnding, tracking and particle iden-
tiﬁcation. Because of too many degrees of freedom
(up to 220 million 10-bit samples) we have to ﬁnd a
smaller number of orthogonal parameters.

To enable using the optimal combination of local
and global information about the tracks and clusters,
the parallel Kalman ﬁlter tracking method was pro-
posed. Several hypothesis are investigated in parallel.
The global tracking approach such as Hough trans-
form was considered only for seeding of track candi-
dates.
In the following, the additional information
which was used will be underlined.

2. Accuracy of local coordinate
measurement

The accuracy of the coordinate measurement is lim-
ited by a track angle which spreads ionization and by
diﬀusion which ampliﬁes this spread.

The track direction with respect to pad plane is
given by two angles α and β (see ﬁg. 1). For the
measurement along the pad-row, the angle α between

where i is the index of primary electron cluster and
j is the index of the secondary electron inside of the
primary electron cluster. Random variable ~xi is a po-
sition where the primary electron was created. The
position ~yi
j is a random variable speciﬁc for each elec-
tron. It is given mainly by a diﬀusion.

and σnoise describe the contribution of the electronic
noise to the resulting sigma of the COG.

4. Precision of cluster COG
determination using measured
amplitude

We have derived parametrization using as parame-
ters the total number of electrons Nch and the number
of primary electrons Nchprim. This parametrization is
in good agreement with simulated data, where the Nch
and Nchprim are known. It can be used as an estimate
for the limits of accuracy, if the mean values N ch and
N chprim are used instead.

The Nch and Nchprim are random variables de-
scribed by a Landau distribution, and Poisson dis-
tribution respectively .

In order to use previously derived formulas (9, 10),
the number of electrons can be estimated assuming
their proportionality to the total measured charge A
in the cluster. However, it turns out that an empirical
parametrization of the factors G(N )/N = G(A)/(kA)

5. Estimation of the precision of cluster
position determination using measured
cluster shape

The shape of the cluster is given by the convolution
of the responses to the electron avalanches. The time
response function and the pad response function are
almost gaussian, as well as the spread of electrons due
to the diﬀusion. The spread due to the angular eﬀect
is uniform. Assuming that the contribution of the
angular spread does not dominate the cluster width,

4

CHEP03, La Jolla, California, March 24-28, 2003

the cluster shape is not far from gaussian. Therefore,
we can use the parametrization

where KMax is the normalization factor, t and p are
time and pad bins, t0 and p0 are centers of the cluster
in time and pad direction and σt and σp are the r.m.s.
of the time and pad cluster distribution.

where σpreamp and σPRF are the r.m.s. of the time
response function and pad response function, respec-
tively.

The ﬂuctuation of the shape depends on the con-
tribution of the random diﬀusion and angular spread,
and on the contribution given by a gas gain ﬂuctua-
tion and secondary ionization. The ﬂuctuation of the
time and pad response functions is small compared
with the previous one.

The measured r.m.s of the cluster is inﬂuenced by

a threshold eﬀect.

σ2
t =

(t − t0)2×A(t, p)

(16)

XA(t,p)>threshold

The threshold eﬀect can be eliminated using two di-
mensional gaussian ﬁt instead of the simple COG
method. However, this approach is slow and, more-
over, the result is very sensitive to the gain ﬂuctuation.
To eliminate the threshold eﬀect in r.m.s. method,
the bins bellow threshold are replaced with a vir-
tual charge using gaussian interpolation of the clus-
ter shape. The introduction of the virtual charge im-
proves the precision of the COG measurement. Large
systematic shifts in the estimate of the cluster posi-
tion (depending on the local track position relative to
pad–time) due to the threshold are no longer observed.
Measuring the r.m.s. of the cluster, the local dif-
fusion and angular spread of the electron cloud can
be estimated. This provides additional information
for the estimation of distortions. A simple additional
correction function is used:

σCOG → σCOG(A)×(1 + const× δRMS
teorRMS

),

(17)

where σCOG(A) is calculated according formulas 10
and 9, and the δRMS/teorRMS is the relative distor-
tion of the signal shape from the expected one.

The classical approach for the beginning of the
tracking was chosen.
Before the tracking itself,
two-dimensional clusters in pad-row–time planes are
found. Then the positions of the corresponding space
points are reconstructed, which are interpreted as the
crossing points of the tracks and the centers of the
pad rows. We investigate the region 5×5 bins in pad-
row–time plane around the central bin with maximum
amplitude. The size of region, 5×5 bins, is bigger than
typical size of cluster as the σt and σpad are about 0.75
bins.

The COG and r.m.s are used to characterize clus-
ter. The COG and r.m.s are aﬀected by systematic
distortions induced by the threshold eﬀect. Depend-
ing on the number of time bins and pads in clusters
the COG and r.m.s. are aﬀected in diﬀerent ways.
Unfortunately, the number of bins in cluster is the
function of local track position. To get rid of this
eﬀect, two-dimensional gaussian ﬁtting can be used.

Similar results can be achieved by so called r.m.s.
ﬁtting using virtual charge. The signal below thresh-
its expected
old is replaced by the virtual charge,
value according a interpolation. If the virtual charge is
above the threshold value, then it is replaced with am-
plitude equal to the threshold value. The signal r.m.s
is used for later error estimation and as a criteria for
cluster unfolding. This method gives comparable re-
sults as gaussian ﬁt of the cluster but is much faster.
Moreover, the COG position is less sensitive to the
gain ﬂuctuations.

The cluster shape depends on the track parameters.
The response function contribution and diﬀusion con-
tribution to the cluster r.m.s. are known during clus-
tering. This is not true for a angular contribution to
the cluster width. The cluster ﬁnder should be opti-
mised for high momentum particle coming from the
primary vertex. Therefore, a conservative approach
was chosen, assuming angle α to be zero. The tan-
gent of the angle β is given by z-position and pad-row
radius, which is known during clustering.

6.1. Cluster unfolding

The estimated width of the cluster is used as crite-
ria for cluster unfolding. If the r.m.s.
in one of the
directions is greater then critical r.m.s, cluster is con-
sidered for unfolding. The fast spline method is used
here. We require the charge to be conserved in this
method. Overlapped clusters are supposed to have the
same r.m.s., which is equivalent to the same track an-
gles. If this assumption is not fulﬁlled, tracks diverge
very rapidly.

The unfolding algorithm has the following steps:

• Six amplitudes Ci are investigated (see ﬁg. 2).
First (left) local maxima, corresponding to the

TULT011

Two cluster resolution depends on the distance be-
tween the two tracks. Until the shape of cluster trig-
gers unfolding, there is a systematic shifts towards to
the COG of two tracks (see ﬁg. 3), only one cluster
is reconstructed. Afterwards, no systematic shift is
observed.

6.2. Cluster characteristics

The cluster is characterized by the COG in y and z
directions (fY and fZ) and by the cluster width (fSig-
maY, fSigmaZ). The deposited charge is described by
the signal at maximum (fMax), and total charge in
cluster (fQ). The cluster type is characterized by the
data member fCType which is deﬁned as a ratio of
the charge supposed to be deposited by the track and
total charge in cluster in investigated region 5×5. The
error of the cluster position is assigned to the cluster
only during tracking according formulas (11) and (12),
when track angles α and β are known with suﬃcient
precision.

Obviously, measuring the position of each electron
separately the eﬀect of the gas gain ﬂuctuation can
be removed, however this is not easy to implement
in the large TPC detectors. Additional information
about cluster asymmetry can be used, but the result-
ing improvement of around 5% in precision on sim-
ulated data is negligible, and it is questionable, how
successful will be such correction for the cluster asym-
metry on real data.

However, a cluster asymmetry can be used as ad-
ditional criteria for cluster unfolding. Let’s denote µi
the i-th central momentum of the cluster, which was
created by overlapping from two sub-clusters with un-
known positions and deposited energy (with momenta
1µi and 2µi).

Let r1 is the ratio of two clusters amplitudes:

r1 = 1µ0/(1µ0 + 2µ0)

and the track distance d is equal to

d = 1µ1 − 2µ1.

Assuming that the second moments for both sub-
clusters are the same (0µ2 = 1µ2 = 2µ2), two sub-
clusters distance d and amplitude ratio r1 can be es-
timated:

ters at primary vertex in both the z-
direction and in r-ϕ plane.

6.3. TPC seed ﬁnding

The ﬁrst and the most time-consuming step in
tracking is seed ﬁnding. Two diﬀerent seeding strate-
gies are used, combinatorial seeding with vertex con-
straint and simple track follower.

6.4. Combinatorial seeding algorithm

Combinatorial seeding starts with a search for all
pairs of points in the pad-row number i1 and in a
pad-row i2, n rows closer to the interaction point
(n = i1 − i2 = 20 at present) which can project to
the primary vertex. The position of the primary ver-
tex is reconstructed, with high precision, from hits in
the ITS pixel layers, independently of the track deter-
mination in the TPC.

Algorithm of combinatorial seeding consists of fol-

lowing steps;

• Loop over all clusters on pad-row i1

6.5. Track following seeding algorithm

Seeding between two pad-rows, i1 and i2, starts in
the middle pad-row. For each cluster in the middle
pad-row, the two nearest clusters in the pad-row up
and down are found. Afterwards, a linear ﬁt in both
directions (z and y) is calculated. Expected prolonga-
tion to the next two pad-rows are calculated. For next
prolongation again two nearest clusters are found. Al-
gorithm continue recursively up to the pad-rows i1
and i2. The linear ﬁt is replaced by polynomial after
7 clusters. If more than half of the potential clusters
are found, the track parameters and covariance are
calculated as before.

6.6. Seed ﬁnding strategy

– Loop over all clusters on pad-row i2, in-
side a given window. The size of the win-
dow is deﬁned by a cut on track curvature
(C), requiring to seed primary tracks with
pt above a threshold.

∗ When a reasonable pair of clusters
is found, parameters of a helix going
through these points and the primary
vertex are calculated. Parameters of
this helix are taken as an initial ap-
proximation of the parameters of the
potential track. The corresponding co-
variance matrix is evaluated using the
point errors, which are given by the
cluster ﬁnder, and applying an uncer-
tainty of the primary vertex position.

The main advantage of combinatorial seeding is
high eﬃciency, around 90% for primaries with pt >
200MeV/c. The main disadvantage is the N 2 prob-
lem of the combinatorial search. The N 2 problem can
be reduced restricting the size of the seeding window.
This should be achieved by making the distance be-
tween seeding pad-rows smaller as the size of the win-
dow is proportional to i2−i1. However, decreasing the
seeding distance, eﬃciency of seeding and also quality

CHEP03, La Jolla, California, March 24-28, 2003

of seeds deteriorates. The size of the window can be
reduced also by reducing the threshold curvature of
the track candidate.

However, vertex constraint suppresses secondaries,
which should be found also. The track following seed-
ing has to be used for them. This strategy is much
faster but less eﬃcient (80%). The eﬃciency is de-
creased mainly due to eﬀect of track overlaps and for
low-pt tracks by angular eﬀect, which correlates the
cluster position distortion between neighborhood pad-
rows.

The eﬃciency of seeding can be increased repeat-
ing of the seeding procedure in diﬀerent layers of the
TPC. Assuming that overlapped tracks are random
background for the track which should be seeded, the
total eﬃciency of the seeding can be expressed as

ǫall = 1 −

(1 − ǫi),

Y
where ǫi is a eﬃciency of one seeding. Repeating
seeding, eﬃciency should reach up to 100%. Unfor-
tunately, tracks are sometimes very close on the long
path and seeding in diﬀerent layers can not be consid-
ered as independent. The eﬃciency of seeding satu-
rate at a smaller value then 1. Another problem with
repetitive seeding is that occupancy increases towards
to the lower pad-row radius and thus the eﬃciency is
a function of a the pad-row radius.

However, in order to ﬁnd secondaries from kinks
or V0 decay, it is necessary to make a high eﬃcient
seeding in outermost pad-rows. On the other hand in
the case of kinks, in the high density environment it
is almost impossible to start tracking of the primary
particles using only the last point of the secondary
track because this point is not well deﬁned. In order
to ﬁnd them, seeding in innermost pad-rows should be
performed. In both seeding strategies, large decrease
of eﬃciency and precision due to the dead zones is
observed. Additional seeding at the sector edges is
necessary. The length of the pads for the outermost
30 pad-rows is greater than for the other pad-rows.
The minimum of the occupancy and the maximum
of seeding eﬃciency is obtained when we use outer
pad-rows. In order to maximize tracking eﬃciency for
secondaries it is necessary to make almost continual
seeding inside of the TPC. Several combination of the
slow combinatorial and the fast seeding were investi-
gated. Depending on the required eﬃciency, diﬀerent
amount of the time for seeding can be spent. The de-
fault seeding for tracking performance results was cho-
sen as following: two combinatorial seedings at out-
ermost 20 pad-rows, and six track following seedings
homogenously spaced inside the outermost sector.

More sophisticated and faster seeding is currently
under development. It is planned to use, for seeding,
only the clusters which were not assigned to tracks
classiﬁed as almost perfect. The criteria for the almost
perfect track has to be deﬁned, depending on track
density.

in parallel. Following algorithm is used:

• For each track candidate the prolongation to the

next pad-row is found.

• Find nearest cluster.

• Estimate the cluster position distortions accord-

ing track and cluster parameters.

• Update track according current cluster parame-

ters and errors.

• Remove overlapped track hypotheses, i.e. those

which share too many clusters together.

• Stop not active hypotheses.

• Continue down to the last pad-row.

The prolongation to the next pad-row is calculated
according current track hypothesis. Distortions of the
local track position σy and σx are calculated accord-
ing covariance matrix. For each track prolongation
a window is calculated. The width of the window is
set to ±4σ where σ is given by the convolution of the
predicted track error and predicted expectation for
cluster r.m.s. Clusters in the container are ordered ac-
cording coordinates, binomial search with log(n) per-
formance is used. The nearest cluster is taken max-
imal probable. No cluster competition is currently
implemented because of the memory required when
branching the Kalman track hypothesis and because
of the performance penalty.

The width of the search window was chosen to take
into account also overlapped clusters. The position
error in this case could be signiﬁcantly larger than es-
timated error for not overlapped cluster, and the over-
lap factor is not known apriori. On the other hand,
the minimal distance between two reconstructed clus-
ters is restricted by a local maxima requirement. Two
clusters with distance less the ∼2 bins (∼1 cm) can
not be observed.

Once, the nearest cluster is found the cluster error is
estimated using the cluster position and the amplitude
according formulas (12) and (11). The correction for
the cluster shape and overlapped factor is calculated
according formula (17).

The cluster is ﬁnally accepted if the square of resid-
uals in both direction is smaller than estimated 3σ. If
this is the case track parameters are updated accord-
ing cluster position and the error estimates.

It may occur that the track leaves the TPC sec-
tor and enters another one.
In this case the track
parameters and the covariance matrix is recalculated
so that they are always expressed in the local coordi-
nate system of the sector within which the track is at
that moment. The variable fNFindable is deﬁned as

a number of potentially ﬁndable clusters. If track is
locally inside the sensitive volume, the fNFindable is
incremented otherwise remains unchanged.

If there are no clusters found in several pad-rows in
active region of the TPC, track hypothesis should be
removed. The cluster density is deﬁned to measure
the density of accepted clusters to all ﬁndable clusters
in the region, where region is several pad-rows.

It is not known apriori, if a given track is primary
or secondary, therefore local density can not be inter-
preted deﬁnitely as real density. This would be true
only for tracks which really go through all considered
pad-rows. Tracks with low local density are not com-
pletely removed, they are only signed (fRemoval vari-
able) for the next analysis.

In order to be able to remove track hypotheses
which are almost the same so called overlap factor is
deﬁned. It is the ratio of the clusters shared between
two tracks candidates and the number of all clusters.
If the overlap factor is greater than the threshold,
track candidate with higher χ2 or signiﬁcantly lower
number of points is removed. The threshold is pa-
rameter, currently we use the value (in performance
studies) at 0.6. This is a compromise between the
maximal eﬃciency requirement and minimal number
of double found tracks requirement. In the future this
parameters will be optimized, to increase double track
resolution. In this case a new criteria to remove dou-
ble found tracks will have to be used.

7.1. Double track resolution

In the ALICE TPC represents the main challenge
for tracking the large track density. From some dis-
tance between two tracks the clusters are not resolved
anymore. In our algorithm the track candidates are
removed if some fraction of the clusters are common
to two track candidates. There are three possibili-
ties, if the two tracks are overlapped on a very long
path. Either it is the same track, or the two very close
tracks or the two tracks where one changed direction
to the second one, and the change of the direction was
misinterpreted as multiple scattering.

New criteria should be deﬁned to handle this situa-
tion. Cluster shape can be used again for this purpose.
If the two tracks overlap and their separation is too
small, only one cluster is reconstructed, however, its
width is systematically greater. Moreover, the charge
deposited in the cluster is also systematically higher.
Another problem is with double found clusters

mainly at the low-pt region. There are two reasons:

• The non gaussian tail of Coulomb scattering
could change the direction of the track, track can
be lost and found again during the next seeding.
• Because of large inclination and Landau ﬂuctu-
ations clusters with double local maxima could
be created.

In order to maximize double-track resolution, and
to minimize the number of double found tracks, the
new criteria (mean local deposited charge and mean
local cluster shape) are under investigation.

7.2. dE/dx measurement

To estimate particle mean ionization energy loss
dE/dx, logarithmic truncated mean is used. Using
the current cluster ﬁnder the truncation at 60% gives
the best dE/dx resolution. Currently the amplitudes
at local cluster maxima are used, instead of the total
cluster charge, in order to avoid the distortion due to
the track overlaps. Shared clusters are not used for
the estimate of the dE/dx at all.

The measured amplitude is normalized to the track
length, given by angles α and β and by the pad length.
Speciﬁc normalization factors are used for each pad
type as the electronic parameters (gas gain, pad re-
sponse function) are diﬀerent in diﬀerent parts of the
TPC. The normalization condition requires the same
dE/dx inside each part of the TPC for one track.

Correlation between the measured dE/dx and par-
ticle multiplicity was observed. The additional cor-
rection function for the cluster shape was successfully
introduced, to take into account local clusters over-
laps.

8. Conclusions

We have described current development in the AL-
ICE TPC tracking which is one of the most challeng-
ing task in this experiment. The track ﬁnding eﬃ-
ciency increases, compared to the previous attempts,
for primary tracks by about 10%, and even more for
secondary tracks. The main improvement is a con-
sequence of the sophisticated cluster ﬁnding and de-
convolution which is based on detail understanding
of the physical processes in the TPC and the opti-
mal usage of achievable information. Another factor
which helped in eﬃciency increase, especially for sec-
ondary tracks, is the new seeding procedure. The AL-
ICE TPC tracker fulﬁl, and even exceeds the basic re-
quirement. Further development will be concentrated

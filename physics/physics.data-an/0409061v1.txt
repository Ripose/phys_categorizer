Abstract

In this paper, we present a simple model of scale-free networks that incorporates both

preferential & random attachment and anti-preferential & random deletion at each time

step. We derive the degree distribution analytically and show that it follows a power law

with the degree exponent in the range of (2, ∞). We also ﬁnd a way to derive an expression

of the clustering coeﬃcient for growing networks and simulate the average path length.

Keywords: scale-free network, degree distribution, clustering coeﬃcient, average path

(WWW), communities of scientists and biological cells can all be described as complex net-

works. Although various complex networks exist in various diﬀerent ﬁelds, their evolutions

are driven by a few rules. We believe that three intrinsic rules are behind the evolutions of

most complex networks. They are randomness, adaptability and hereditary. The existing

investigations usually focus on one or two of the three rules.

The earliest study of complex networks can be traced to the investigation of regular

graphs characterized by a large clustering coeﬃcient and a long average path length. Erd¨os

and R´enyi [3] initiate the studies of complex networks as random graphs. They propose

the ER model which has a short average path length and a small clustering coeﬃcient.

Later observations have found that some real networks have not only short average path

lengths like random graphs but also large clustering coeﬃcients like regular graphs. These

two features characterize the small-world network. Watts and Strogats [4] later develop a

model based on regular graphs in which links are random rewired with a ﬁxed probability.

For some range of small rewiring probabilities, their model successfully displays the small-

world characteristics. Two things are common for random graphs and small-world networks:

randomness of connections between nodes and exponential decay of the tail of the degree

distribution.

However, more recent empirical evidences from the Internet and WWW, among other

complex networks, show a fundamentally diﬀerent picture, i.e., the tail of the degree distri-

bution follows a power law. Two general features have been observed in many real-world

networks: successive additions of new nodes and preference to link to the existing nodes.

This shows that randomness is not the unique feature of networks and leads to the introduc-

tion of scale-free networks in 1999 by Albert, Baraba´asi, and Jeong in their pioneering works

[5, 6, 7], which start a new phase in the study of complex networks. Albert, Baraba´asi, and

Jeong propose two mechanisms to characterize the evolution of a scale-free network [6, 7]:

the growth, starting from m0 nodes, the network grows at a constant speed, i.e., adding

one node at each time step and connecting to m (m ≤ m0) existing nodes; the preferential

attachment, the chance that an existing node receives a connection from a new node is

proportional to the number of connections it already has. Here the phenomenon of pref-

erential attachment reﬂects the adaptability of complex network. The authors show that,

under these two mechanisms, a network evolves into a stationary scale-free state. Its degree

distribution follows a power law with the degree exponent γ = 2.9 ± 0.1 from simulation

analysis and γ = 3 from the analytical result. These results are signiﬁcant for complex

networks and these two mechanisms become the ﬁrst model, referred to as the BA model.

Although the BA model can be used to interpret many phenomena of complex networks,

the degree exponent is a constant, which is a weakness since most empirical studies shows

2

that γ can be either less than 3 or large than 3 in real complex networks [1].

To improve the original BA model, many researchers suggest diﬀerent mechanisms for

both growth and preferential attachment under which the range of γ varies from 2 to inﬁnity.

In the following, we will brieﬂy review some signiﬁcant works.

Krapivsky, Redner, Leyvraz [8] examine the eﬀect of a nonlinear preferential connection

probability Π(k) on complex networks. By analyzing the rate equation, they demonstrate

that the topology of the network is scale-free only when the preferential attachment is

asymptotically linear. Dorogovtsev, Mendes, and Samukhin [9] use a master-equation ap-

proach to study complex networks in which the probability Π(k) is proportional to the sum

of a node’s initial attractiveness and the number of incoming edges. By applying mean-ﬁeld

theory, Dorogovtsev and Mends [10] consider both preferential attachment and random re-

moval (with equal probability) in the evolution of a network. Albert, Baraba´asi [11] study

internal edges and rewiring, Dorogovtsev and Mends [12] propose models for gradual aging.

Diﬀerent from the BA model, Krapivsky, Rodgers, Render [13] consider a growing net-

work with directed edges. In their model, at each time step, either a new node or a new link

is randomly added to the network and the attachment probability depends on the in- or

out-degrees of nodes. By solving rate equations, they conclude that both in- and out-degree

exponents lies in (2, ∞). Kleinberg et al. [14], Kumar et al. [15, 16] address an alternative

preferential mechanism named copy mechanism by adding random links with “prototype”

nodes. It is found that the copy mechanism is equivalent to a linear preferential attachment.

Krapivsky and Render [17]’s edge redirection mechanisms is mathematically equivalent to

Kumar et al.’s model discussed above.

From the reviewed works, we ﬁnd two common facts: (1) under linear growth, the range

of the degree exponent can be extended to inﬁnity by adding randomness into model; (2)

local events and growth constraints have a similar function, which is to make the degree

exponent vary between 2 and 3. Although the above research extends the range of the

degree exponent, their proposed mechanisms are relatively complex. Compared with the

above models, Liu et. al [18]’s model is relatively simple.

It combines the ideas from

[3] and [6] to model the probability that a new node is connected to node i already in

the network. They ﬁnd that the degree exponent is no less than 3, so the model is not

applicable to situations when the degree exponent is between 2 and 3, which is the most

common range observed in real world. Recently, Chen and Shi [19] introduces the concept

of anti-preferential deletion into the BA model and show that 2 < γ < 3. This shows that

integrating randomness and anti-preferential deletion into the BA model, one may construct

a simple model for a general class of scale-free networks with γ > 2.

This research is mainly motivated by the above observation. Based on [18] and [19],

3

we propose a simple evolution model of complex networks with preferential and random

attachment, anti-preferential and random deletion. We show that the network self-organizes

into a scale-free network. We obtain the expression of the degree exponent analytically, and

ﬁnd it lies in (2, ∞). Clustering coeﬃcient is another key network parameter, but analytical

estimations are hard to obtain for growth networks as reﬂected by the current state of the

literature. In this paper, we are able to derive an analytical expression for the clustering

coeﬃcient. Our method can be useful for similar studies. In short, our model is constructed

from simple mechanisms and can be applied to analyze a general class of complex networks.

We organize the paper as follows. In the next section, we present a simple model of scale-

free network. In section 3, we obtain the degree exponent analytically. Section 4 develops

a method to derive the clustering coeﬃcient. Section 5 discusses the average path length.

We conclude the paper in Section 6 by pointing out some future research opportunities.

2 Model Description

Our network starts with m0 completely connected nodes. At each time step, the following

two procedures are performed:

(i) A new node is added to the system: m(≤ m0) new edges from the new node are

connected to m diﬀerent existing nodes. A node i with degree ki will receive a connection

from the new node with the linear-preferential probability

Π(ki) =

(1 − p)ki + p
j[(1 − p)kj + p]

,

(1)

(2)

where p is the probability that the selection of an existing node (for attachment) is random

P

while (1 − p) is the probability that the selection of an existing node (for attachment)

preferential.

(ii) c old links are deleted: We ﬁrst select node i with at least one link as one end of a

link with the anti-linear-preferential probability

Π∗(ki) = N −1(t − 1)[1 − Π(ki)],

where N (t − 1) is the number of connected nodes with nonempty links at t time step and
N −1(t − 1) is used as the normalized coeﬃcient such that
i Π∗(ki) = 1. Then, we choose
another node j from the neighborhood of node i (denoted as Oi ) as the other end of the link
with probability K −1Π∗(kj ), where K =
j∈Oi ∪i Π∗(kj ). We delete the link connecting
nodes i and j. We repeat this procedure c times to delete c old links.

P

The basic ideas of the above process is to use a linear combination of a random selection

probability and a preferential selection probability as the selection probability. We believe

P

4

that this linear selection rule for attachment and deletion models real world networks more

closely, from the point of view of the evolutionary theory.

3 Degree Distribution

By the continuum theory, ki(t) satisﬁes the following dynamic equation:

∂ki
∂t

= mΠ(ki) − c[Π∗(ki) +

K −1Π∗(kj)Π∗(ki)]

Xj6=i,j∈Oi

= mΠ(ki) − c{Π∗(ki) + Π∗(ki)[1 − K −1Π∗(ki)]}

≈ m

(1 − p)ki + p
[2(1 − p)(m − c) + p]t

,

− c

for large t.

We note that from the assumption that N (t − 1) ≈ t, we have ki(t) ∝ tβ where β < 1
and hence {Π∗(ki) + Π∗(ki)[1 − K −1Π∗(ki)]} ≈ 2/t. Together with
j[(1 − p)kj + p] =
[2(1 − p)(m − c) + p]t, we obtain the approximation in (3). The simulation results on the

P

degree exponent presented later in this section show that the accuracy of this approximation.

Let ti be the time step when node i is added to the network.

Initially, node i has

ki(ti) = m links, thus the above equation has the following solution:

ki(t) = B

,

where the dynamic exponent

and the coeﬃcient

B = B(m, p, c) = m +

mp − 2c[2(1 − p)(m − c) + p]
m(1 − p)

.

In the solution procedure, we require 0 < β < 1 and B > 0 for the feasible solution. To

guarantee 0 < β < 1, the parameters should satisfy

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

(1 − p)(m − 2c) + p > 0.

On the other hand, the condition B > 0 holds if and only if

m2(1 − p) + mp − 4c(1 − p)(m − c) − 2cp > 0 ⇔

(1 − p)(m − 2c)2 + p(m − 2c) > 0 ⇔

(m − 2c)[(1 − p)(m − 2c) + p] > 0.

Therefore, we conclude that B > 0 if only if (7) is held. In sum, we see that m > 2c is

a suﬃcient condition for both 0 < β < 1 and B > 0.

Assume that ti follows the uniform distribution over interval (0, t). Then, by (4), we

have

(9)

Thus, this system self-organizes into a scale-free network with a degree exponent given by

Since [p − 2c(1 − p)]/[m(1 − p)] is increasing in p and γ = 3 − 2c/m > 2 for p = 0, we have

γ > 2. In particular, when p ≤ 2c(1 − p), we can generate values of γ between 2 and 3. Such

γ values have been observed in diﬀerent networks including the WWW and movie actor

collaboration networks [7]. For p → 1, we have γ → ∞ while for (1 − p)(m − 2c) + p → 0,

we obtain γ → 2. Further, when p = c = 0, it yields the BA model [6]; when p = 0 and

c > 0, it gives Model B (with n = 0) proposed by Chen and Shi [19]; when p > 0 and c = 0,

it is equivalent to the model studied in Liu et. al [18].

We now use simulation to compute the degree distribution of our model. We set m0 = 10,

m = 5, c = 1 and p = 0.667. Analytically, γ = 3 from (9). In the experiment, we take the

average from 100 runs. After computation, we obtain γ ≈ 2.996, and the coeﬃcient is 29.692.

Figure 1 shows that the results of the simulation, which indicates the approximations in (3)

are reasonable.

Remark 1. Suppose that at each time step, we also perform an additional process: n new

edges between old nodes are produced: a node i is selected as a end of a new edge, with the

probability Π(ki) given by (1). Then, the new degree exponent is given by

γ = 3 +

p − 2(1 − p)(n + c)
(m + 2n)(1 − p)

.

(10)

We can show that this process has no impact on the range of γ. Further, by (10), when

we let c = 0, we ﬁnd that the range of γ is kept the same under the eﬀect of n, which

indicates that the function of adding new edges between old nodes is equivalent to that of

anti-linear-preferential deletion.

Remark 2. Now, at each time step, we consider another additional operation: we rewire n

existing edges in the network: select randomly a node i and a link lij connected to it. Next

we rewire this link and replace it with a new link li′j that connects node j and node i′ chosen

with the probability Π(ki) given by (1). This operation is repeated n times. As a result, the

degree exponent is given by

γ = 3 +

p − 2(1 − p)(n + c)
(m + n)(1 − p)

.

(11)

Clearly, n also does not aﬀect the range of γ. Moreover, if we let c = 0, we see that

the function of rewiring old edges between old nodes is equivalent to that of anti-linear-

preferential deletion.

4 Clustering Coeﬃcient

In this section, we present a method to derive an explicit expression for clustering

coeﬃcients of growing network models.

Consider a node l. When the size of the network is N , there will be kl(N ) nodes in

its neighborhood. The maximum possible number of links among all the neighbors of node

l is kl(N )[kl(N ) − 1]/2. The clustering coeﬃcient Cl(N ) of node l is then deﬁned as the

ratio between the actual number of links among all the nodes in the neighborhood and

kl(N )[kl(N ) − 1]/2. The clustering coeﬃcient of the network is then the average of the

clustering coeﬃcients of all the nodes in the network.

To compute the clustering coeﬃcient, we will rewrite dynamic equation (3) in the fol-

lowing integral form

ki(t) = m +

m(1 − p)ki(j) + mp − 2ca1
a1j

dj,

t

i
Z

(12)

7

where a1 = 2(1 − p)(m − c) + p > 0.

From (12), we ﬁnd that the expected number of links connecting node i added at the

ith time step with node j added at the jth time epoch up to time step t is given by

t

i
Z

m(1 − p)ki(j) + mp − 2ca1
a1j

dj.

Next, by continuous theory, we obtain that the probability for the existence of a link

from the node j to node i (i < j), i.e.,

P rob{(ij)} =

m(1 − p)ki(j) + mp − 2ca1
a1j

=

a2jβ−1
a1iβ ,

(13)

where the second equality is followed from (4) and a2 = m2(1 − p) + mp − 2ca1 > 0.

To ﬁnd the number of actual connections among neighbors of a given node l, we need

to consider the sequence (age) by which node l and its neighbors appear. For example,

l < i < j means that node l is older than node i which is in turn older than node j. Then,

the expected number of edges between node i and node j that are neighbors of node l is

given by

N
i djp(lj)p(ij). Similarly, we have to count ﬁve other cases: i < l < j,
i < j < l, l < j < i, j < l < i and j < i < l. The related integration expressions of six cases
R

N
l dip(li)

are given in (14), respectively. Note that we count the links between any two node twice,

we need to divide the sum of six integrations by 2. Also, we approximate the maximum
number of connections by kl(N )2/2. Thus, we obtain

Cl(N ) =

Now, we consider ﬁrst two extreme cases of our model: β = 0.5 and β = 0. For

β = 0.5, we set p = 0, c = 0. In this case, our model is equivalent to the BA model, and
p(ij) = p(ji) = m(ij)−1/2/2. Furthermore, (14) can be simpliﬁed to

The last equation is the same as the one provided in [23]. Noting that Cl(N ) is independent

of l, (15) also gives the cluster coeﬃcient of the whole network.

Analytical integration of the above equation is next to impossible in general. For an

approximation of the network clustering coeﬃcient and to identify it asymptotic behavior
as N becomes large, it is reasonable to approximate kl(N ) by B(N/l)β. This allows us to

Remark 3. Although the new model combines randomness and adaptability, the clustering

coeﬃcient is still quite small for a relatively large N . This shows that networks constructed

with the two intrinsic rules do not exhibit the small world property, although it does exists

in many real world scale-free networks. What are the reasons for this inconsistency? What

is missing in our construction process? Our conjecture is that the third intrinsic evolution

rule, i.e. hereditary, has been ignored in the model.

5 Average Path Length

We now examine the relationship between the average short path length L and the total

number of nodes N in two experiments. For each experiment, we set m0 = 10, test the
range of N from 103 to 104, and take the average from 100 simulation runs. We then ﬁt the

data from the experiments by linear regression.

Firstly, we examine the impact of m and p on L by comparing the following 5 cases,

with a ﬁx c = 0:

Case I: m = 8, p = 0;

Case II: m = 6, p = 0;

Case III: m = 4, p = 0;

Case IV: m = 4, p = 0.4;

Case V: m = 4, p = 0.8.

Comparing the ﬁrst three cases, Figure 2 shows that L is decreasing in m. This is because

the connectivity degree increases with more newly added links. Figure 3 demonstrates how

L changes with p in the last three cases. We ﬁnd that L is increasing in p, which indicates

that the randomness results in the long L.

Secondly, we study the relationship between L and N under diﬀerent values of the degree

exponent γ.

11

Case IV: m = 4, p = 0.4, γ = 3.167;

Case VI: m = 5, c = 1 and p = 0.4, γ = 2.667.

In Figure 4, we observe that L in Case IV is a bit shorter than that in Case VI. The

phenomenon shows that although a smaller γ yields a larger probability that a node has

more links, it is not the only factor that determines L. The length of L also depends on the

network construction mechanism.

Finally, noting that a log scale of the system size N is used, we can see in all three

ﬁgures a logarithmic growth of L with respect to N .

6 Conclusions and Discussions

There are two main contributions in this paper. First, by successfully integrating ran-

domness and adaptability, we introduce a simple yet very ﬂexible model for scale networks.

While, as demonstrated in the previous sections, a number of the existing models are, in

some way, special cases of our model, we are still able to derive an explicit expression for the

network degree distribution. Our second contribution is the analytical expressions that we

obtain for the clustering coeﬃcient for a large class of scale-free networks. Apparently, there

are not many successes in the literature for cluster coeﬃcients due to analytical diﬃculties.

Thus, the method we use in section 4 should be useful for others in the future.

Our discussion of cluster coeﬃcients leads to an important observation, i.e., Remark 3

in section 4. Without hereditary, the important small world phenomenon displayed in real

networks cannot be captured in our model as well as in many existing models. This shows

much remain to be done in our quest to understand complex networks better.

Some attempts have been made in including hereditary. Ravasz and Barab´asi [21] build

up a model of hierarchical organization with deterministic copy of a module. Dorogovtsev

et al. [20] model scale-free networks by a deterministic pseudofractal graph. Although the

authors show that the clustering coeﬃcient of a node follows a power law with respect to

the degree of the node, randomness and adaptability are absent. Sol´e et al. [22] investigate

proteome growth model with random node duplications, old removal edges, and newly added

edges. Empirically, they ﬁnd by simulation that their model can explain the macroscopic

features exhibited by the proteome. Klemm and Egu´ıluz [23]’s model combines the motif

13

copy and the BA model using a probability µ. For µ = 0, their model has the characters of

small-world networks. For µ = 1, their model is equivalent to the BA model. But, due to

the analytical diﬃculty for 0 < µ < 1, the performance of the model can not be well studied.

Holme and Kim [24] integrate preferential attachment with triad information to construct

a scale-free network. By simulation, they show that their model can generate small-world

characters.

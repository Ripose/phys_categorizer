Hierarchical noise in large systems of independent agents

(Submitted: ; Printed: February 21, 2014)

A generalization of the coherent-noise models [M. E. J. Newman and K. Sneppen, Phys. Rev.
E54, 6226 (1996)] is presented where the agents in the model are subjected to a multitude of
stresses, generated in a hierarchy of diﬀerent contexts. The hierarchy is realized as a Cayley-tree.
Two diﬀerent ways of stress propagation in the tree are considered. In both cases, coherence arises
in large subsystems of the tree. Clear similarities between the behavior of the tree model and
of the coherent-noise model can be observed. For one of the two methods of stress propagation,
the behavior of the tree model can be approximated very well by an ensemble of coherent-noise
models, where the sizes k of the systems in the ensemble scale as k−2
. The results are found to be
independent of the tree’s structure for a large class of reasonable choices. Additionally, it is found
that power-law distributed lifetimes of agents arise even under the complete absence of correlations
between the stresses the agents feel.

I. INTRODUCTION

II. AGENTS IN A HIERARCHICAL CONTEXT

It has recently been shown that in large systems of in-
dependent “agents”, the interplay of two diﬀerent types
of noise can lead to power-law distributed quantities,
like life-times of the agents, or sizes of reorganization
events [1]. One of the two noises, usually referred to
as stress, has to act coherently on all agents, while the
other one, usually referred to as mutation or reloading,
has to act individually on each agent, and on a much
longer time scale. Mechanisms of this kind have been
called “coherent-noise” mechanisms. Models incorporat-
ing coherent-noise mechanisms have been put forward to
explain eﬀects seen in earthquakes, rice-piles, or biologi-
cal evolution and extinction [1–4].

In most applications, however, it is hard to justify a
single stress imposed on the whole system at once. In [2],
the stress was identiﬁed with global inﬂuences on the
biosphere, as in the case of extraterrestrial impacts [5].
Nevertheless, there are more reasons for species to go ex-
tinct than impacts. Often, species’ extinction is a local
phenomenon [6]. For example, species living in a small
territory regularly die out because of the invasion of a
new species, able to exploit their ecological niche more
eﬀectively. A similar argument applies to the situation
In [1] the stress has been interpreted
of earthquakes.
as background noise with long wavelength, generated by
some distant external source. Nonetheless, in a large
fault system, we would expect background noise to be
present also locally, and probably on smaller and larger
scales at the same time [7].

The aim of the present paper is to advance a model
that, while incorporating the basic ideas of coherent-noise
systems, can deal with more complex situations by con-
sidering stress on diﬀerent scales. A short account of this
work has already been given elsewhere [8]. There, only
regular trees (see below) have been treated.

It is an observation from every-day life, as well as
from many physical systems [9], that very often ob-
jects or agents are embedded into a hierarchy of dif-
ferent contexts, all having inﬂuences on them. Mathe-
matically, this idea can be described with the concept
of ultrametricity [10], which means there exists a dis-
tance d(·, ·) such that the triangle inequality d(A1, A3) ≤
max{d(A1, A2), d(A2, A3)} holds for any three agents A1,
A2, A3. Geometrically, an ultrametric space can be con-
ceived of as a Cayley-tree. In the following, vertices in the
tree connected to exactly one other vertex will be called
leaves, and vertices connected to two or more other ver-
tices will be called nodes.
In this paper, the nodes of
the tree stand for diﬀerent contexts, and the agents are
placed at the tree’s leaves.

We can now formulate a generalization of the original
coherent-noise model by incorporating the above ideas.
Our system consists of N agents, each represented by a
real number (threshold) xi, or, in the general case, a vec-
tor xi. Furthermore, we choose a tree with Nn nodes and
Nl = N leaves, which means Nv = Nn + Nl vertices in
total. The tree will be kept ﬁxed throughout the simula-
tion. At every leaf we put exactly one agent. For every
node j of the tree we choose a stress distribution with
probability density function (PDF) pj(x). Additionally,
we also choose a stress distribution for every leaf of the
tree, so that we have a stress distribution for every vertex
of the tree. The stress distributions at the leaves allow to
simulate extremely localized inﬂuences acting only on a
single agent. The total number of stresses in the system
is therefore Nstress = Nv.

The course of the simulation runs as follows. At the
beginning, the agents are initialized with random thresh-
olds drawn from a distribution pthresh(x). Then, in every
i) from each of
time step, three actions are performed:

the Nstress stress distributions, a stress ηj is chosen at
random. ii) for every agent i, from all the Si stress val-
ues η(i)

is calculated according to some function A:

(cid:17)

If ηeﬀ
i ≥ xi, agent i is removed and replaced by a new
one with a threshold chosen at random from pthresh(x).
iii) ﬁnally, every agent has a small probability f to get a
new threshold, again from the distribution pthresh(x). Ac-
tion iii) represents the mutation or reloading mentioned
in the introduction.

There are a number of reasonable choices for the func-
tion A. In this paper, we will mainly study the “maxi-
mum rule”, which reads

This alternative, which we will call “sum rule”, will also
be discussed in this paper.

III. THE EFFECTIVE STRESS DISTRIBUTION

The eﬀective stress an agent feels can be calculated
exactly in the case of the maximum rule, Eq. (2). The
agent is subjected to the stress distribution at its leaf
and the stress distributions at the nodes above it. Let
there be S − 1 nodes above the leaf of an agent. Then the
S stress values having inﬂuence on this agent are S ran-
dom variables X1, . . . , XS with PDF’s p1(x), . . . , pS(x).
To obtain the eﬀective stress distribution, we have to cal-
culate the PDF pmax(x) of the random variable Xmax =
max{X1, . . . , XS}, i.e.,

pmax(x) dx = P

x ≤ max{X1, . . . , XS} < x + dx

. (4)

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

For reasons of simplicity, in the following we will de-
note probabilities of the form P (x ≤ X < x + dx) by
P (x ≃ X). With the partition theorem [11] we can write
the probability on the right-hand side of Eq. (4) as a
weighted sum of conditional probabilities:

appear in a coherent-noise model if the stress distribution

(9)

where C and α are positive constants which depend on
pstress(x) [12]. We assume this condition to hold for the
distributions pj(x) in Eq. (8), with constants Cj and
αj, respectively. Then we can approximate the tail of
pmax(x) by

We proceed further by taking only linear terms in pi(x)
and obtain

pmax(x) ≈

pi(x)

(11)

S

X

For large x, this sum will be dominated by the pi(x) that
is falling oﬀ slowest. We say that distribution pi(x) falls
oﬀ slower than distribution pj(x) if there exists a x0 such
that

pi(x) > pj(x)

for all x > x0.

(12)

For a set of reasonable stress distributions it is always
possible to identify the one that is falling oﬀ slowest ac-
cording to this deﬁnition. Hence, we ﬁnd for the PDF of
the eﬀective stress on an agent

pmax(x) ∼ p0(x)

for x → ∞ ,

(13)

where p0(x) is the one of the S stress distributions that
is falling oﬀ slowest.

A similar statement cannot easily be proved for the
sum rule. However, in special cases the necessary calcu-
lations can be done. Consider, for example, the case of
exponential stress distributions pi(x) = exp(−x/σi)/σi.

cases, the sum of the stresses will be dominated by a sin-
gle distribution in the limit of large stresses, as it is the
case in the situation of the maximum of the stresses.

IV. REGULAR TREES

In this section we are interested in trees which are con-
structed as follows. We begin with a single leaf and con-
vert it into a node by connecting to it n new leaves. Then
we repeat this procedure for every new leaf. We stop
the construction when we have reached a depth of l it-
erations. Trees generated in this way are called regular
trees [13]. The tree displayed in Fig. 1 is a regular tree
with n = 2 and l = 4.

The number of leaves in a regular tree is

(10)

and the number of vertices is

Nl = nl ,

Nv =

ni .

l−1

i=0
X

(16)

(17)

Therefore, we have N = nl agents in such a tree, and Nv
stress values have to be generated in every time step.

We saw in Sec. III that every agent feels eﬀectively
a single stress distribution in the limit of large stresses
(Eqns. (13), (15)). Since for coherent-noise systems, large
stresses give the main contribution to the systems’ behav-
ior, the stress distributions that are falling of very slowly
dominate large parts of the tree. Hence, the tree breaks
down into subsystems that are to some extent decoupled
from each other. For regular trees, it is relatively easy
to study the average distribution of the subsystems’ sizes
analytically. We assume for any two stress distributions
pi(x), pj (x) in the tree we can identify one of the two that
is falling oﬀ slower, according to Eq. (12). This is not a
severe restriction, as we have noted in Sec. III. Addi-
tionally, we restrict ourselves to situations in which pi(x)
and pj(x) are equally likely to fall oﬀ slower than the re-
spective other. Under these conditions, we can rank all
stress distributions in a tree, assigning rank 1 to the one
that is falling oﬀ fastest, and assigning correspondingly
higher ranks to the ones that are falling oﬀ slower. This
makes the calculation of the subsystems’ sizes relatively
easy. For every single agent, we have to identify the corre-
sponding highest rank placed above it in the tree (which
we will call the rank of the agent). Then, we simply have
to count the number of agents with the same rank. This
procedure is illustrated in Fig. 1.

We expect the mean distribution of subsystems’ sizes
to have sharp peaks whenever the size of a complete sub-
tree is reached, because the probability for a single rank
to be higher than all others further down the tree should
be larger than the probability for a complicated arrange-
ment of ranks to produce a subsystem of a certain size.
The size k of a subsystem is the number of leaves in that
subsystem. The functional dependency of the peaks at

3

size k is calculated as follows. The expected frequency
f (k) to ﬁnd an independent subtree of depth b, corre-
sponding to a subsystem of size k = nb, can be writ-
ten as the number of such subtrees in the whole system,
Nsub(nb), times the probability that any of these sub-
trees will be independent of the rest, Pindep(nb). Hence
we write

f (nb) = Nsub(nb)Pindep(nb) .

The number of subtrees of size nb is

Nsub(nb) = nl−b .

(18)

(19)

A subtree is independent of the rest if the rank at its root
is higher than all other ranks in the subtree and at the
nodes above the subtree. The probability Pindep(nb) is
therefore the reciprocal of the number of vertices in the
subtree plus the number of vertices above the subtree,
hence

Pindep(nb) =

l − b +

b

.

(20)

(cid:16)

i=0

(cid:17)

If we increase b by one, we get Nsub(nb+1) = nl−b−1 =
Nsub(nb)/n. With slightly more eﬀort, we ﬁnd also

Pindep(nb+1) =

l − b − 1 +

f (nk) ≈

Nsub(k)

Pindep(k)

= n−2f (k) ,

(22)

which implies f (k) ∼ k−2.

This result is interesting. The frequency of subsystems
of size k scales as k−2, independent of the parameter n
which characterizes the structure of the tree.

We have tested these predictions by measuring the fre-
quency f (k) in computer experiments. Our simulations
are set up as follows. We choose a tree with Nv vertices
in total. For several thousand times, we assign the inte-
gers from 1 to Nv randomly to the vertices of the tree.
The integers stand for the rank of the stress-distributions
at the vertices. For every single realization of this pro-
cess, we determine the sizes of the subsystems the tree
breaks down into, and compute a histogram of the sizes’
frequencies. Finally, we calculate the average over all
histograms.

Fig. 2 shows the results of such measurements for two
diﬀerent trees with 10 000 histograms each. We can see
clear peaks at powers of n, which correspond to com-
plete subtrees. We also ﬁnd the heights of the peaks to
decrease as k−2, in agreement with Eq. (22).

V. RANDOM TREES

The regular trees treated in the previous section can
be easily generalized to a broader class of trees, which
we will call “random trees”. Only a small change in the
construction algorithm is necessary. To construct a reg-
ular tree, in every iteration step we connect n new leaves
to every leaf of the previous step. The straightforward
generalization of this procedure is to choose a random
number of new leaves for every leaf of the previous con-
struction step. To avoid confusion with the parameter
n, we will call this random number nrand. The random
variable nrand will take value i with probability pi, i.e.,
i pi = 1. We denote
P (nrand = i) = pi, i = 0, 1, 2, . . .,
the mean of nrand by m := hnrandi and the variance by
σ2. Moreover, we assume m > 1 in all cases considered in
this paper. In the limit σ2 → 0, the random trees reduce
to regular trees with n = m.

P

The construction of a random tree as prescribed above
is a branching process with l generations. From the the-
ory of branching processes [14] , we know that for large
l the number of leaves in the tree will be

Nl = W ml ,

(23)

where W is a random variable with mean hW i = 1. The
factor W takes into account ﬂuctuations that happen at
the beginning of the tree’s construction. Correspond-
ingly, for the total number of vertices in the tree we use
the approximation

Nv ≈ W

l

mi .

(24)

i=0
X
The above two equations are the generalizations of
Eqs. (16), (17) for random trees.

As in the case of regular trees, we are interested in
the quantity f (k), the expected frequency to ﬁnd inde-
pendent subsystems of size k. In the previous section we
made the assumption that the main contributions to f (k)
come from complete subtrees. The comparison with nu-
merical data showed that this assumption leads to a good
understanding of the structure of f (k). Consequently, in
the case of random trees we also assume that we can
concentrate on complete subtrees.

The number of subtrees of size k in a large tree is on
average the size of the tree (which is the number of leaves
in the tree) divided by k. Hence we have

Nsub(k) =

Nl
k

,

(25)

which is equivalent to Eq. (19) for regular trees.

We proceed with the calculation of the probability for
a subsystem of size k to be dominated by a single stress
distribution. This probability, denoted by Pindep(k), is
simply one over the total number of vertices that have

4

inﬂuence on agents in the subsystem. Hence, we must
calculate the number of vertices in a subtree from its size
k. We do this in the following way: a tree of depth b
corresponds to a systemsize

kf (k) = Nl ,

(33)

Nl

k=1
X

k(b) = W ′mb .

(26)

which means the subsystems’ frequencies, weighted with
the subsystems’ sizes, must sum up to the total system
size Nl. Consequently, we get

Here W ′ is a random variable with the same distribu-
tion as W in Eq. (23). It takes into account the concrete
structure of a certain subtree. We rearrange Eq. (26) for
b and get

b(k) = logm

k
W ′ ,

(27)

with

To end up with the number of vertices in a subtree, we
have to use b(k) instead of l in an equation similar to
Eq. (24). However, b(k) is not an integer in general,
hence the sum is undeﬁned. We can resolve this problem
by rewriting Eq. (24) in the form

where we have made use of the identity

Nv ≈ W

m − 1

(28)

(29)

From the above equations we see that the probability
for a subsystem of size k to be independent from the
rest of the tree depends on the special structure of the
corresponding subtree, expressed by the factor W ′. Con-
sequently, all we can calculate is P W
indep(k), i.e., the prob-
ability for a special subtree, characterized by W ′, to be
independent from the rest of the tree. We ﬁnd

(36)

As in the case of regular trees, we ﬁnd a power-law de-
crease of the form f (k) ∼ k−2.

P

Eq. (36) is in good agreement with measurements from
computer experiments. We have done simulations with
several diﬀerent probability distributions for nrand, such
as uniform [p0 = c/(nmax + c); c ≥ 0; pi = 1/(nmax + c)
for 1 ≤ i ≤ nmax; pi = 0 for nmax < i], geometric series
∞
[pi = bci−1 for i ≥ 1; b, c > 0; b ≤ 1−c; p0 = 1−
j=1 pj],
or gaussian [pi ∼ exp(−(i − b)2/c); here b and c are not
mean and variance, because we use only discrete values
of the gaussian probability density function]. In all cases,
we ﬁnd Eq. (36) to approximate well the measured fre-
quency f (k). An example is shown in Fig. 3. Deviations
from the straight line can be seen for very small k and for
very large k. In these two limiting cases, the assumptions
of the above approximations are no longer valid. Con-
sider ﬁrst the case of a very small k. This corresponds to
k ≈ m, because we always assume m ≪ Nv (otherwise,
the tree would have roughly a depth of 1, which would
not be very interesting). If k is close to m, the number of
subtrees of size k depends strongly on the exact form of
the probability distribution of nrand, and Eq. (25) is no
longer valid. Since, as seen above, the main contribution
to f (k) comes from complete subtrees, the distribution
of nrand then has eﬀects on f (k). For example, in a sit-
uation where P (nrand = m) = 0, there should be a clear
dip in f (k) at k = m.

Consider now the case of a very large k. Again Eq. (25)
is no longer valid. This time because there are so few
subtrees of size k. Hence, the exact structure of the tree
comes into play. For example, a tree with Nv = 105
containing a subtree with k = 6 × 104 will not contain
another subtree with k = 5 × 104. Therefore, in this
situation there should be a clear peak at k = 6 × 104.

VI. SIMULATION RESULTS

As the main result of Sections IV and V, we found
the distribution of independent subsystems of size k in
the tree to be proportional to k−2. Therefore, in the
limit of large stress values η, we expect the tree model to
behave like an ensemble of coherent-noise models whose
sizes scale as k−2.

When constructing the ensemble approximation of a
certain tree, we have to choose the right stress distribu-
tion for every coherent-noise model in the ensemble. In
principle, this can be a complicated task. However, we
have found that a very simple approach instead works
suﬃciently well in many cases. It can be motivated with
Fig. 4. There, we have recorded the average ranks of
the subsystems in a tree. Interestingly, the average rank
varies only very little with the subsystem’s size k. There-
fore, in a further approximation, we assume that all the
stress-distributions that dominate a subsystem have the
same rank, i.e., they are all the same (we use a single
stress distribution, but the stress values are still chosen
independently for all systems in the ensemble).

Our numerical simulations show the similarity between
the tree model and the ensemble. We begin with results
for the maximum rule.

A. The distribution of event sizes

Like in previous work [12,15], an “event” is the reorga-
nization of agents because of stress in a single time step.
The size of an event is the total number of agents hit by
the stress.

The event sizes of a typical simulation with maximum
rule are recorded in Fig. 5. The lower curve shows the dis-
tribution of event sizes of a tree model, the upper curve
shows the same distribution of the corresponding ensem-
ble of coherent-noise systems. The heights of the curves
reﬂect the total number of events we recorded for each
model and have no special meaning. The sizes of the sys-
tems in the ensemble are exactly the ones we obtained for
the sizes of the tree’s subsystems while doing the ranking
procedure described in Sec. IV. The distribution of these
sizes is shown in the inset of Fig. 5.

The tree used in Fig. 5 is a random tree with 14213
vertices and 12163 leaves. Hence, both the tree model
and the ensemble contain 12163 agents in total. The
stress distributions used in the tree are exponentials
exp(−x/σi)/σi, with diﬀerent values σi between 0.03 and
0.06. The stress distribution used in the ensemble is an
exponential with σ = 0.06.

As we can see in Fig. 5, the tree model and the en-
semble behave very similar with regard to event sizes.
In both cases, we ﬁnd approximately a power-law de-
crease. A power-law ﬁt gives an exponent of 2.3 ± 0.15
for the tree model, and of 2.2 ± 0.15 for the ensemble.
Note the clear diﬀerence between the exponent in these

two systems and the exponent in a single coherent-noise
model with exponential stress. There, the exponent is
1.85 ± 0.03 [12].

The event-size distribution depends strongly on the
distribution of the subsystems in the tree. In Fig. 6, we
have used the same tree structure and the same stress dis-
tributions as in Fig. 5, but the stress distributions have
been assigned to diﬀerent vertices. As a result, in this
case the tree model has a lack of large subsystems, as
can be seen in the inset of Fig. 6. Consequently, large
events appear less frequently, and the distribution is sig-
niﬁcantly steeper than in Fig. 5 (now we have an expo-
nent of 2.9 ± 0.2 for the tree model and an exponent of
2.8 ± 0.2 for the ensemble).

B. Aftershocks

Coherent-noise models display aftershocks [1,15], i.e.,
an increased number of large events can be observed in
the aftermath of a very large event. Consequently, we
study the decay pattern of the aftershocks in the tree
model and in the ensemble. We will restrict ourselves to
the case of events in the aftermath of an initial inﬁnite
event. We follow closely the ideas and methods devel-
oped in [15]. Fig. 7 shows the change of the probability
Pt(s ≥ s1) with time. Pt(s ≥ s1) is the probability to
ﬁnd an event larger than some constant s1 at time t af-
ter an initial inﬁnite event. For both the tree model and
the ensemble, the probability Pt(s ≥ s1) decreases with
time, indicating aftershocks. However, we do not observe
a clear power-law decrease, normally visible in the case
of coherent-noise models [15].

As in the case of event-sizes, we ﬁnd a close similarity
between the tree model and the ensemble. Let us ﬁrst
focus on the upper two curves in Fig. 7, which corre-
spond to s1 = 0.02 and s1 = 0.0025 (here, s1 is measured
in units of the number of agents in the tree, which was
12163 in this case). For large t, the curves for the tree
model and for the ensemble lie on top of each other, indi-
cating the same decay pattern for long-time correlations.
Only for small times there are some deviations between
the two models. The tree model produces more after-
shocks shortly after the inﬁnite event. This observation
has its origin in the fact that the two models converge
in the limit of large stresses, but the number of moder-
ate stresses produced by the tree model is signiﬁcantly
larger than the one produed by the ensemble. At short
times after a very large event, already moderate stresses
can trigger large events, thus increasing the number of
events seen in the tree model as compared to the ensem-
ble.

For large values of s1, the similarity between the two
models seems to disappear. The curves in Fig. 7 corre-
sponding to s1 = 0.05 do not lie on top of each other.
The curve for the tree model is shifted upwards by about
a factor of three. This discrepancy for large s1 can be

6

understood from Fig. 8. There, we display the frequency
distribution of the events that have been produced dur-
ing the simulations for Fig. 7. The results for the tree
model and for the ensemble are very similar. However,
at an event-size of about 1000, the frequency distribution
for the ensemble falls oﬀ rather quickly, whereas the fre-
quency distribution for the tree has an additional peak
at about 1400. It is this peak that causes the shift of the
probability Pt(s ≥ s1) in the tree model for large s1.

The peak in the tree model arises because from time to
time a very large stress will be generated at the root of
the tree, causing an event of the order of the tree’s size.
In the ensemble, on the other hand, events larger than
the largest subsystem are extremely unlikely.

C. The distribution of lifetimes

The lifetime of an agent is the time an agent remains
in the system without being hit by stress. In the orig-
inal coherent-noise model, the agents’ lifetimes are dis-
tributed as a power-law with exponent 2 − 1/α [12]. The
quantity α depends on the stress distribution, and it is
related to the mean-ﬁeld exponent τ of the event size
distribution by τ = 1 + α. For exponential stress, e.g.,
we have α = 1. Hence, in this case the lifetimes L are
distributed as L−1.

The distribution of lifetimes in a coherent-noise model
does not change if the stress is imposed on each agent
independently, instead of being imposed on all agents co-
herently. This is diﬀerent to the case of event sizes or
aftershocks. It can be seen as follows. The derivation of
the lifetime distribution in [12] makes use of the time-
averaged distribution of the agents’ thresholds, which re-
mains the same whether or not the stress is imposed co-
herently. The only further assumptions that enter the
calculation are assumptions about the form of pstress(x)
and pthresh(x), but no assumptions about the coherence
of stresses are made. Therefore, the distribution of life-
times in a coherent-noise model and in a large ensemble
of degenerate coherent-noise models with size 1 is the
same, provided the stress distributions and the threshold
distributions are the same. Consequently, if the stress-
distributions in the tree have all the same α (e.g., are
all exponentials), the distribution of the agents’ lifetimes
should be similar to the one in a coherent-noise model
with τ = 1 + α. This can be seen in Fig. 9. The distribu-
tion of lifetimes in a random tree with exponentially dis-
tributed stresses is similar to the one in a coherent-noise
model with exponential stress (compare, e.g., Fig. 9 with
Fig. 5 in [12]).

D. Trees with sum rule

In the previous paragraphs, we studied simulations
with the maximum rule. Here, we will present some re-

sults from simulations with the sum rule. On the ﬁrst
glance, one would expect that the tree model behaves
the same whether we choose Eq. (2) or Eq. (3) for cal-
culating the eﬀective stress on the agents, at least for
exponential stress, because of Eq. (15). However, this
is not exactly the case. In Fig. 10, we display the dis-
tribution of event sizes in a simulation where stresses
are summed up. The tree used in this simulation is ex-
actly the same we used in the simulation of Fig. 5. This
allows an easy comparison between the two choices for
A. Note that all stress distributions are exponentials,
which implies that Eq. (15) holds. We observe the emer-
gence of a power-law decrease, similar to the situation
with the maximum rule. However, the resulting distribu-
tion is slightly steeper than in Fig. 5, with an exponent
of 2.6 ± 0.1. This steeper distribution shows that the
conception of a tree being equivalent to an ensemble of
coherent-noise models is less accurate when stresses are
summed up. Second-order eﬀects arise because all stress
distributions contribute to the overall system’s behavior
at all times (which is in contrast to the case when we use
the maximum of the stresses). Consequently, the agents
feel the stress less coherently, resulting in a smaller num-
ber of large events.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

Coherent-noise models have been proposed by New-
man and Sneppen to explain the occurence of power-laws
in a number of natural systems. The underlying mech-
anism is remarkably simple and robust. However, the
coherent stress necessary to make these models work is
an impediment to their application, since in most systems
coherence is not present a priori, and local phenomena
are important. In this paper, we were able to show that
in hierarchical contexts, coherence can arise naturally in
large subsystems. In the tree models we presented, the
system breaks down into a number of subsystems, each
of them having a high degree of coherence and being
largely independent of the rest. Interestingly, the num-
ber of subsystems of size k decreases as k−2 for a large
class of diﬀerent trees. The emergence of coherent sub-
systems is closely connected to the domination of some
stress distributions by others. We should always observe
this phenomenon if the function A is proportional to a
single stress distribution in the limit of large stresses.

We made also an interesting observation about the
agents lifetimes. We found the distribution of lifetimes
to be the same in the tree model and in coherent-noise
models, as long as the stress distributions in both models
have the same functional dependency. Furthermore, from
the arguments given in Section VI C we can deduce an
even more general statement. In any system where agents
under the inﬂuence of stress are modeled as in coherent-
noise systems, the distribution of the agents’ lifetimes will
be a power-law, even if there is no correlation between

stresses diﬀerent agents feel. This is a new explanation
for the appearance of power-law distributed life-times or
waiting-times in non-equilibrium systems valid under ex-
tremely weak conditions.

Further work extending the tree model presented here
could address appearance and disappearance of agents. If
we consider, for example, the case of biological evolution
and extinction, the biodiversity is constantly changing,
with the main tendency of exponential growth through-
out the past 1000 million years [16] (this trend, how-
ever, has changed dramatically nowadays, because of ever
increasing human activity [17]). ”Real” extinction and
speciation could be incorporated into the tree model by
removing from the tree the agents hit by stress, as it
has been done already in the case of coherent-noise mod-
els [4]. Related to this, one could consider trees changing
their structure. Up to now, we studied only ﬁxed trees,
mainly for reasons of simplicity. Another extension could
be the consideration of vector stresses, as it has been done
by Sneppen and Newman for the original coherent-noise
model [12], inspired by a similar generalization of the
Bak-Sneppen model [18].

Abstract

We evaluate the exact equilibrium distribution of gas molecules

adsorbed on an active surface with an inﬁnite number of attachment

sites. Our result is a Poisson distribution having mean X = µP Ps
Pe

,

with µ the mean gas density, Ps the sticking probability, Pe the evap-

oration probability in a time interval τ , and P Smoluchowski’s exit

probability in time interval τ for the surface in question. We then solve

for the case of a ﬁnite number of attachment sites using the mean ﬁeld

approximation, recovering in this case the Langmuir isotherm.

1 Introduction

One of the models aimed at explaining the collapse of the wave function [1]

predicts that the wave function of every system collapses to an eigenstate of

the Hamiltonian in the energy basis in a time which depends on the energy

spread of the wave packet. For a system including the measuring apparatus,

relevant sources of energy ﬂuctuations are thermal energy ﬂuctuations and

energy (mass) ﬂuctuations coming from ﬂuctuations in the number of surface

adsorbed molecules. Our aim in this paper is to derive formulas for the

equilibrium distribution of adsorbed molecules on an active surface S, from

which the root mean square mass ﬂuctuation can be calculated. Our results

could also be relevant in other contexts - e.g. in surface catalysis.

Since our work is based largely on the classical colloidal statistics problem

[2] solved by Smoluchowski, we will review his result ﬁrst. Consider a gas

chamber of volume V which has N gas molecules distributed randomly inside.

Assuming uniform occupancy, the probability that a single molecule is found

inside a small subvolume v is v

V and of not being found inside is V −v

V . So

the probability U(n) of some n particles being found inside v is given by the

binomial distribution

3

n!(
U(n) =  N

v
V

)n(1 −

v
V

)N −n

(1)

The mean number of particles µ found inside the small volume v is just the

mean of this binomial distribution N v

V . In terms of µ then, the distribution

U(n) becomes

n!(
U(n) =  N

µ
N

)n(1 −

µ
N

)N −n

(2)

For most practical cases N and V are both very large, but the ratio of N/V

is ﬁnite so that the mean µ is ﬁnite. In this limit, the binomial distribution

of Eq.(2) reduces to the Poissonian form

U(n) =

e−µµn

n!

(3)

The interpretation of this equation is the following:

If we focus on a

small subvolume v inside a much larger volume V , then the frequency with

which diﬀerent numbers of particles will be observed in the smaller volume

will follow a Poisson distribution. It should be noted that in addition to the

assumption of all positions in the volume having equal a priori probability

of occupancy, we also assume that the motions of individual particles are

4

mutually independent. In the surface adsorption generalization discussed in

Sec. 2, this is the case for an inﬁnite number of attachment sites, but would

not be the case for a ﬁnite number of attachment sites.

Let us now deﬁne P to be the probability that a particle somewhere inside

the small volume v will have emerged from it during the time interval τ . The

“probability after-eﬀect factor” P will depend on physical parameters such

as the velocity distribution and mean free path of the particles, as well as

the geometry of the surface boundary. In terms of P , the probability that

starting with an initial situation of n molecules inside v, i of them escape in

time τ is

A(n, i) =  n

i!P i(1 − P )n−i

(4)

Let Ei denote the probability of the volume v capturing i particles during

time τ . Ei clearly is independent of the number of molecules already inside.

But, under equilibrium conditions, the a priori probabilities for entrance and

exit must be equal. For each n there is a contribution to the exit probability;

summing over all of them and equating to Ei we get

5

Ei =

∞

Xn=i

U(n)A(n, i)

(5)

Inserting the expressions for U(n) and A(n, i) from Eqs.(3) and (4) we get

Ei =

∞

Xn=i

e−µµn

n!  n

i!P i(1 − P )n−i =

e−µ(µP )i

i!

Xn=i

µn−i(1 − P )n−i

(6)

where from here on we denote a Poisson distribution with mean X by σ(n, X)

with

σ(n, X) =

e−XX n

n!

2 Adsorption of gas molecules

To make our analysis intuitively clear, let us draw an imaginary surface I

just outside the active surface area S. The following notations will be used:

(i) Ei = Probability for i molecules to enter the volume enclosed by I in the

time inverval τ . Since this is the same as in the case where the surface S

inside is absent, this probability is just as in Eq.(6),

6

Ei = σ(i, µP )

(8)

(ii) U(n) = Probability to observe n molecules sticking to S.

(iii) Ps = Probability of a molecule to stick to S after crossing I.

(iv) Pe = Probability for a molecule that is stuck to S to evaporate oﬀ in a

time interval τ .

(v) B(n, i) = Probability that starting with an initial situation with n par-

ticles stuck to S, i of them evaporate in time τ .

By Smoluchowski’s reasoning leading to Eq.(4) above, we have

B(n, i) =  n

i!(Pe)i(1 − Pe)n−i

(9)

At equilibrium, the detailed balance condition holds. This is just the condi-

tion that the probability that i particles stick in a time interval τ is equal to

the probability that i particles evaporate in the same time interval τ . The

probability for i molecules to stick to S is

Ej j

i!P i

s(1 − Ps)j−i

Xj≥i

7

Using Smoluchowski’s expression for Ej from Eq.(8) this becomes

e−µP (µP Ps)i

i! Xj≥i

[µP (1 − Ps)]j−i

(j − i)!

= σ(i, µP Ps)

(10)

The other part of the detailed balance condition, the probability that out

of n molecules on S, i of them evaporate in time interval τ is

Xn≥i

U(n)B(n, i) = Xn≥i

U(n) n

i!P i

e(1 − Pe)n−i.

Equating these two probabilities, we have

σ(i, µP Ps) = Xn≥i

U(n) n

i!P i

e(1 − Pe)n−i.

(11)

(12)

Our task now is to determine the equilibrium distribution U(n) from

this equation. We start with the ansatz that U(n) is a Poisson distribution

σ(n, X) with a mean X which is to be determined,

U(n) = σ(n, X) =

e−XX n

n!

8

(13)

Substituting Eq.(7) into Eq.(12) and using the sum evaluated in Eq.(6), we

get the condition

σ(i, µP Ps) = σ(i, XPe)

(14)

which is satisﬁed when

X =

µP Ps

Pe

(15)

Eqs.(13) and (15) are our result for the equilibrium distribution of adsorbed

molecules. We note that, as intuitively expected, the mean number of ad-

sorbed molecules increases with increasing gas density µ and increasing stick-

ing probability Ps, but decreases with increasing evaporation probability Pe.

As a check on our reasoning, let us calculate the transition probability

W (n, m) for m particles to be stuck to the surface at time T + τ when n

particles were stuck to the surface at time T , and then check that W (n, m)

and U(n) have the requisite Markoﬀ property. The transition probability is

9

given by

W (n, m) = Xx+y=m

W (n)

1

(x)W2(y)

(16)

where W (n)

1

(x) is the probability that x particles remain at time T + τ when

initially there were n at time T ,

W (n)

1

(x) =  n

x!(1 − Pe)xP n−x

e

(17)

and W2(y) is the probability for y additional particles to adhere to the surface

in time τ as given by Eq.(10)

W2(y) = σ(y, µP Ps)

The Markoﬀ property requires that

U(m) = Xn

U(n)W (n, m)

(18)

(19)

with U(m) the equilibrium distribution of Eqs.(13) and (15). Evaluating the

sum on the right-hand side of Eq.(19), we ﬁnd as required that

Xx+y=m

(Xn

U(n)W (n)

1

(x))W2(y) = Xx+y=m

σ(x, X(1 − Pe))σ(y, µP Ps)

= σ(m, X(1 − Pe) + µP Ps) = σ(m, X) = U(m)

3 Finite number of attachment sites - mean

ﬁeld approach

Let us now proceed to calculate the equilibrium distribution of the number

of molecules attached to S where S has a ﬁnite (although very large) number

of attachment sites M. Clearly, our discussion of the previous section breaks

down since the sticking probability is no longer a constant, but depends on

the number n of molecules already attached to S. In the following discussion,

let us use Ps to denote the probability for a molecule to stick to S if no site is

occupied, and let us denote the mean number of occupied sites by m. Then

the mean sticking probability is just

P s = Ps(1 −

m
M

)

and the corresponding distribution of stuck molecules is σ(n, X), with

X =

µP P s

Pe

11

(20)

(21)

Since the mean of this distribution is m = X, we get the mean ﬁeld consis-

tency condition

with solution

m = (1 −

m
M

)

µP Ps

Pe

m =

µP Ps/Pe
(1 + µP Ps
PeM )

(22)

(23)

Thus, the mean fraction m

M of total available sites occupied has the form of

the Langmuir isotherm [3].

The mean ﬁeld approximation is valid as long as the mean number of

vacant sites M − m is much larger than the width √m of the distribution of

adsorbed molecules,

M − m = M(1 −

m
M

) >> √m = √Ms m

M

(24)

Close to saturation, when m

M ≈ 1, substituting Eq.(23) into Eq.(24) gives the

12

condition

1 +

µP Ps
PeM

<< √M

which when X = µP Ps
Pe

>> M simpliﬁes to

X << M

Abstract

I give a simple analysis of the game that I previously published in
Scientiﬁc American which shows the paradoxical behavior whereby two
losing games randomly combine to form a winning game. The game,
modeled on a random walk, requires only two states and is described by
a ﬁrst-order Markov process.

Keywords: Parrondo’s paradox; random games; brownian motors; random walk;
random transport.

In 1986–7 my colleagues and I posed the following “paradox.”[1, 2] Consider a
random walk on a cycle of bases governed by one of two sets of transition con-
stants for stepping between the bases. Using either set alone, the walk is biased
to favor completion of a counterclockwise cycle. However, either periodic[1] or
random[2] alternation between the two sets causes net clockwise cycling!

To illustrate as simply as possible this paradoxical behavior, I published [3]
a very simple game played with a checker stepping on part of a checkerboard.
The stepping is decided by the roll of a pair of dice. Alternation between two
sets of rules for the stepping is achieved by ﬂipping a coin. In a recent paper[4]
Piotrowski and Sladowski discussed this “Astumian paradox” and asserted that
my analysis was ﬂawed, and that the game does not display the paradoxical be-
havior that I claimed. Here I show that the claims Piotrowski and Sladowski are
wrong and that my game does show the paradoxical behavior ﬁrst demonstrated
in Refs.1 and 2.

The game I published in Scientiﬁc American consists of stochastic jumping

between ﬁve diﬀerent states 1, ..., 5 and is based on the diagram below,

where the numbers written above and below the arrows are the probabilities
of transitions between neighboring states. The player wins if he/she winds

up at state ﬁve, and loses if he/she reaches state 1. If the player starts from
state 3 the ratio of the probability of losing to the probability of winning is
5 ∗ 4/(8 ∗ 2) = 20/16 = 5/4 as reported by Piotrowski and Sladowski as well
as by me [3]. However, in their diagram (1), P &S made a critical error -
they implicitly and without justiﬁcation normalized the probabilities such that
p(i → i + 1) + p(i → i − 1) = 1,
i = 2, 3, 4. Not only is this explicitly diﬀerent
than the case in the game I published (diagram (1) above) but is totally and
absolutely incorrect for the physical system - a random walk on a biochemical
network - that the game was designed to illustrate! Indeed, in a monte carlo
simulation of a kinetic network the transition probabilities out of a state should
be much less than one p(i → i + 1) + p(i → i − 1) << 1 so that in any iteration
at most one, and most often zero, transitions occur.

The same numerical result for the ratio of losses to wins is obtained for the

game in diagram (2)

Both games (1) and (2) result in more losses than wins. A modiﬁed game,
where the probabilities are the arithmetic mean of the probabilities for the above
two games, is shown below:

Even a superﬁcial inspection of the above diagram shows that my analysis
published in Scientiﬁc American is correct, and the criticism of Piotrowski and
Sladowski is wrong: The transition from states 2,3, and 4 to the right are more
It seems that
probable than to the left resulting in more wins than losses.
an inability to accurately transcribe the probabilities published in my Scientiﬁc
American and an inability to do simple probability calculations for a pair of dice
have resulted in drawing wrong conclusions by Profs. Piotrowski and Sladowski.

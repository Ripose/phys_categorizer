ABSTRACT
Millisecond and binary pulsars are the most stable natural frequency standards. They
can be applied to a number of principal problems of modern astronomy and time-
keeping metrology including the search for stochastic gravitational wave background
in the early universe, testing General Relativity and establishing of new ephemeris
time scale. The full exploration of pulsar properties requires obtaining proper unbi-
ased estimates of the spin and orbital parameters, a problem which deserves a special
investigation. These estimates depend essentially on the random noise component be-
ing revealed in the residuals of time of arrivals (TOA) and having a diﬀerent physical
origin. In the present paper, the inﬂuence of low-frequency (”red”) timing noise with
spectral indices from 1 to 6 on TOA residuals, variances, and covariances of estimates
of measured parameters of single and binary pulsars are studied. In order to determine
their functional dependence on time, an analytical technique of processing of obser-
vational data in time domain is developed. Data processing in time domain is more
informative since it takes into account both stationary component of noise and its
non-stationary countepart. Data processing in frequency domain is valid if and only if
the noise is stationary. Our analysis includes a simpliﬁed timing model of a binary pul-
sar in a circular orbit and procedure of estimation of pulsar parameters and residuals
under the inﬂuence of red noise. We reconﬁrm, in accordance with results of previous
authors, that uncorrelated white noise of errors of measurements of TOA brings on
gradually decreasing residuals, variances and covariances of all parameters. On the
other hand, we show that any low-frequency, correlated noise of terrestrial or/and
astrophysical origin present causes the residuals, variances, and covariances of certain
parameters to increase with time. Hence, the low frequency noise corrupts our obser-
vations and reduces experimental possibilities for better tests of General Relativity
Theory. At the same time, the rate of growth of residuals and variances of parameters
can give a valuable information about the red noise itself. We also treat in detail the
inﬂuence of a polynomial drift of noise on the residuals and ﬁtting parameters in order
to avoid confusion with red noise without the polynomial drift. Results of the analitic
analysis are used for discussion of a statistic describing stabilities of kinematic (PT)
and dynamic (BPT) pulsar time scales.

1 INTRODUCTION

Timing observations of single and, especially, binary millisecond pulsars are widely recognized as being extremely important

for progressing a number of branches of modern astronomy and time keeping metrology. In particular, implication of pulsar

timing for testing General Relativity in the strong-ﬁeld regime (Taylor & Weisberg 1982, 1989), creation of a new astronomical

time scale based on the high-stable rotation of millisecond pulsars (Ilyasov et al. 1989, Kaspi et al. 1994)as well as setting

up the upper limit on the energy density of stochastic gravitational wave background in early universe (McHugh et al. 1996,

Kopeikin 1997a, and references therein) are among the most successful and stimulating recent achivements in this area of

research.

1997).

1990).

The accuracy of pulsar timing observations is now approaching ∼ 100 nanoseconds. Such high precision requires con-

struction of adequate data processing algorithms taking proper account of the relevant physical eﬀects which can contribute

to the timing signal being processed. Signiﬁcant theoretical understanding of relativistic celestial mechanics of binary systems

has been made since the discovery by Hulse and Taylor (1975) of the ﬁrst binary pulsar PSR B1913+16 (Damour et al.

1989, Damour & Sch¨afer 1988, Ohta & Kimura 1988, Sch¨afer & Wex 1993, Kopeikin & Potapov 1994, Sch¨afer 1995, Wex

1995). Presently, one is able to predict both secular evolution and periodic perturbations of the binary system’s orbit up to

the 2 1

2 post-Newtonian approximation (PNA) where emission of gravitational waves starts to inﬂuence the orbital dynamics

(Grishchuk & Kopeikin 1983, Damour 1983). Presently, eﬀorts are being made towards developing theory of motion of binary

systems in 3 PNA and 3 1

2 PNA of General Relativity (Iyer & Will 1995, Jaranowski & Sch¨afer 1997, Jaranowski 1997, Rieth

It is worth remembering that processing of pulsar timing data comprised of topocentric time of arrivals (TOA) of pulsar

pulses is based on the χ2 minimization procedure of ﬁtting observational parameters of the pulsar to the adopted model of the

observed TOA. This includes polar motion corrections UT1-UTC given by the International Earth Rotation Service (IERS),

the general relativistic model of motion of the observer around the barycenter of the Solar system (Standish 1990) and the

pulsar around the barycenter of the binary system (Damour et al. 1989), the post-Newtonian transformations between diﬀerent

time scales (Brumberg Kopeikin 1990, Fukushima 1995) used in the model, and the law of propagation of electromagnetic

signals in gravitational ﬁelds (Shapiro 1964), as well as the interstellar and interplanetary medium (Rickett 1990, 1996). The

overall model is rather sophisticated and presently exists in the form of two independently developed computer programs:

TEMPO (Taylor & Weisberg 1989), and TIMAPR (Doroshenko & Kopeikin 1990, 1995), both being available on the World

Wide Web. It is worthwhile pointing out that TIMAPR is based on the unique theoretical approach for construction of

relativistic time scales and reference frames in the Solar system developed in (Kopeikin 1988, Brumberg & Kopeikin 1989,

Usually, the procedure for estimating pulsar parameters is based on the premise that white noise dominates in TOA

residuals. However, long-term monitoring of certain pulsars has revealed the presence of non-white component of noise of

astrophysical origin as well (Cordes & Downs 1985, Kaspi et al. 1994, D’Allesandro et al. 1996). It is customary call such

correlated noise as a coloured Gaussian (or, simply, as ”red”) one because its spectrum diverges at zero frequency (”the

c(cid:13) 1994 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–39

Millisecond and Binary Pulsars as Nature’s Frequency Standards

infra-red catastrophe”). At low frequencies the red noise has a non-ﬂat spectrum and can be described in framework of single-

or multiple- component power-law model. The lower the timing activity of the pulsar, the further toward low frequencies

one must look in order to detect the red noise in the spectrum of its TOA residuals. Although being fairly diﬃcult for

detection, red noise contains invaluable information about diversity of physical processes which take place in the neutron star

interior, the interstellar medium, early universe, and man-made terrestrial clocks (Lorimer 1996). For this reason, developing

a rigorous procedure for accounting for the red noise component in TOA residuals is worthwhile. Physicists have been working

on the problem of adequate treatment of red noise for a long time (see, for example, Stratonovich & Sosulin 1966, Van Trees

1968, Hooge 1976, Planat et al. 1996). However, one of the ﬁrst attempts in developing proper statistical procedure of ﬁtting

pulsar parameters in the presence of low-frequency, red noise has been undertaken only recently by Bertotti et al. (1983),

and Blandford et al. (1984) in order to obtain unbiased estimates of the pulsar’s parameters as well as upper limit on the

energy density of the GWB radiation. There is a need to further improve on probabilistic models of the red noise and methods

of estimation of its characteristics containing essential information about long-term processes having both geophysical and

astrophysical origins, including the stochastic background of primordial gravitational radiation. The present state-of-the art

of statistical analysis of pulsar timing observational data in the presence of red noise has not yet reached the required level

of clarity and completeness, and more elaborate methodology has to be developed. This point has been especially stressed by

Bertotti et al. (1983), Hogan & Rees (1984), Blandford et al. (1984), and Kopeikin (1997a, 1997b).

Systematic studies of timing noise in post-ﬁt residuals was started by Groth (1975) and Cordes (1978, 1980) (see also

Cordes & Helfand (1980), Cordes & Greenstein (1981), and Cordes & Downs (1985)), who put forward a random walk

noise model along with the use of orthonormal polynomials for analyzing properties of the noise in the time domain. These

investigations stimulated development of a somewhat equivalent approach for estimating the spectral power of the low-

frequency noise which was evaluated in the Fourier frequency domain and non-uniformly sampled data by Deeter & Boynton

(1982) and Deeter (1984). The power spectrum technique was later applied to pulsar timing data by Deeter et al. (1989). This

formalism was worked further into a practical procedure by Stinebring et al. (1989) and extensively employed by Kaspi et al.

(1994), and Thorsett & Dewey (1996) for setting an upper limit on the cosmological parameter Ωg using the Neyman-Pearson

test of statistical hypothesis. McHugh et al. (1996) recently reﬁned this procedure to make it even more rigorous using the

approach based on the Bayesian statistic.

It is worth noting that the analysis in the time domain is more informative than that in the frequency domain. This is

because noise contains usually both stationary and non-stationary components, and spectral analysis of the noise in frequency

domain is adequate if and only if the noise itself is stationary (or its increments). For this reason, the procedure advanced

by Stinebring et al. (1989) is principally restricted by the implicit assumption on stationarity of timing noise and, therefore,

its implications for processing real observational data are jeopardized. Fortunately, we have been able to prove (Kopeikin

1997a) and reconﬁrm in the present paper that under rather general circumstances the procedure of ﬁtting of pulsar spin

and orbital parameters acts as a low-frequency ﬁlter of the non-stationary component of noise which means that pulsar

post-ﬁt residuals bear, in fact, only the stationary component of noise and the spectral analysis in the Fourier domain is

c(cid:13) 1994 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–39

4

legitimate. Nevertheless, non-stationary part of noise intrudes into observed values of pulsar spin-down parameters, increases

their variances, and bringing on large correlations with other parameters.

Another thing to notice is that inherent to Deeter-Boynton’s procedure are certain limitations, which must be clearly

understood and accounted for in practical implementations. The foremost restriction is that it provides a satisfactory guide to

the selection as well as construction of practical estimators of a power spectrum of noise as long as the noise is approximately

represented by a (2r)-th power law; that is, then it is possible to write the noise spectrum down as S(f ) = K2rf −2r, where

r = 1, 2, 3, ..., and any of K2r is a constant. Let us note that the noise in question can be treated as a random walk in

rotational phase, frequency, or frequency derivative of the pulsar. Stationary stochastic processes possessing power spectra

with odd spectral indices S(f ) = K2r+1f −2r−1, (r = 0, 1, 2, ...) are called ﬂicker noise and require development of a more

advanced statistical approach. A possible way towards the development of such an approach in the frequency domain was

explored by Blandford et al. (1984). However, it is not as far-going as one would desire. From the mathematical point of

view the diﬃculty is due to the existence of an algebraic singularity in the spectrum of low-frequency noise as frequency

approaches the point f = 0. When the spectral index of the noise is large enough, the singular behavior of the power spectrum

leads to formally divergent integrals describing timing residuals and variances of measured parameters. To avoid this problem,

a special regularization procedure must be applied to these integrals to ascribe them deﬁnite numerical values and, as a

consequence, a real physical meaning. There are several known methods of dealing with regularization of functionals with

algebraic singularities. Blandford et al. (1984) used the simplest procedure of regularization based on the eﬀective spectral

cutoﬀ of the divergent integrals. As a consequence, their estimators of spectral power of the noise as well as variances of

pulsar parameters depend on the lower cut-oﬀ frequency, fmin, and two numbers, A, and, N ∗, which are used for minimizing

root-mean-square error in rotational frequency through the post-ﬁt residuals. The cutoﬀ frequency fmin and numbers A and

N ∗ are not constant and depend on the total span of observations, making temporal behavior of the post-ﬁt residuals and

variances of parameters rather uncertain. In addition, the simple cutoﬀ of divergent integrals leads to enormous leakage of

the spectral power from the low-frequency tails of the estimators and as a consequence to the wrong determination of the

magnitude Km of the noise power spectrum.

We have suggested tackling the problem of divergent integrals using the theory of generalized functions (Gel’fand &

Shilov 1964) as the most powerful and simple in dealing with functions having singular spectra. For instance, this theory has

been successfully applied in Quantum Renormalization Theory (Damour 1975) and for calculations of high-order relativistic

equations of motion of binary pulsars (Damour 1983a, Sch¨afer 1985). Quite recently the theory of generalized functions

has been applied by Kopeikin (1997a, 1997b) for development of an adequate treatment of low-frequency timing noises with

negative integer spectral indices. In particular, we have discovered in these papers for the ﬁrst time that ﬂicker noise caused by

the stochastic background of primordial gravitational radiation in early universe leads to the appearance of speciﬁc logarithmic

terms in the autocovariance functions as well as in variances of spin parameters of observed pulsars. This result is re-conﬁrmed

and considerably extended in the present paper accounting for ﬂicker noise in rotational phase and frequency as well.

As a ﬁnal critical remark, let us point out that the problem of proper estimation of variances of orbital parameters of

binary pulsars in the presence of low-frequency noise has not been yet discussed in full detail. Therefore, the main goal of

the present paper is to provide a self-consistent theoretical and numerical study of this problem. Here we use the results of

our previous work (Kopeikin 1997a) in which the general statistical model of red noise has beeen developed. The plan for

the present paper is as follows. In the next section we describe an analytical timing model which is used in the subsequent

discussion. The procedure of estimation of variances of measured parameters in the presence of low-frequency red noise is

outlined in section 3. A brief description of model of a red noise and its autocovariance function are given in section 4. Section

5 explains computational aspects of our algorithm. Polynomial drift of timing noise is discussed in section 6. The drift-free

noise model is employed in section 7 for analytical evaluation of variances of spin and orbital parameters of a binary pulsar

in the presence of white and the low-frequency noises. Finally, the analytic results are used for studying stability of kinematic

(PT) and dynamic (BPT) pulsar time scales in section 8.

To complete the analysis the study of spectral sensitivity of binary pulsars in diﬀerent frequency bands of the noise

spectrum has to be done. This requires more work which is currently in progress. These results will be published elsewhere.

2 TIMING MODEL

We consider a simpliﬁed, but still realistic model of arrival time measurements of pulses from a pulsar in a binary system. It

is assumed that the orbit is circular, and the pulsar rotates around its own axis with angular frequency νp which slows down

due to the electromagnetic (or whatever) energy losses. It is also taken into account that the orbital frequency of the binary

system, nb, and its projected semimajor axis, x, have a secular drift caused by emission of gravitational waves from the binary

(Peters & Mathews 1963, Peters 1964) bringing about the gravitational radiation reaction force (Damour 1983a, Grishchuk

& Kopeikin 1983), radial acceleration (Damour & Taylor 1991, Bell & Bailes 1996), and proper motion of the binary in the

sky (Kopeikin 1996).

The moment, T , of emission of the N -th pulsar’s pulse relates to the moment, t, of its arrival, measured at the inﬁnite

electromagnetic frequency, by the equations (Damour & Taylor 1992, Kopeikin 1994):

(2)

D [T + x sin (nbT + σ)] = t + φ0(t) + φ1(t),

t = τ ∗ + ∆C + ∆R⊙ + ∆π⊙ + ∆E⊙ + ∆S⊙.

We use the following notations:

• T - pulsar time scale,

• t - barycentric time at the barycenter of the Solar system,

• τ ∗ - topocentric time of observer,

• σ - initial (constant) orbital phase,

• nb - orbital frequency (nb = 2π/Pb),

• i - angle of inclination of the orbit to the line of sight,

• x - projected semimajor axis ap of the pulsar’s orbit (x = ap sin i/c),

• c - speed of light,

• φ0(t) - the gaussian noise of TOA measuring errors,

• φ1(t) - low-frequency gaussian noise caused by the long-term instabilities of terrestrial clocks, eﬀects in propagation of

radio signals in the interstellar medium, and stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves.

We also suppose that observations start at the time t0 = 0. Changing of the starting time of observations from t0 = 0 to

t0 6= 0 is achieved by the simple translation of time scale: t 7→ t − t0. It is worth emphasizing that for nearly circular orbits

the initial orbital phase σ = ω0 − nbT0 where T0 is a ﬁducial moment of time and ω0 is the longitude of periastron. This

relationship remains valid up to the ﬁrst order of magnitude in eccentricity and represents an excellent approximation in the

case of binary pulsars like PSR B1855+09 or PSR J1713+0747.

The rotational phase of the pulsar is given by the polynomial in time

Let us underline that secular variations (time derivatives) of pulsar parameters include not only contributions caused

by the dissipative physical mechanisms like emission of gravitational waves by the binary pulsar, but also depend on the

kinematical eﬀects caused by the radial acceleration and proper motion of the pulsar in the sky (Damour & Taylor 1991, Bell

& Bailes 1996, Kopeikin 1994, 1996).

Another important point which is usually never stressed, but rather crucial, is the treatment of pulsar timing noise φ2(T ).

The noise in question contributes to random jumps of the pulsar’s phase at the moment T of emission of pulse. However,

observer at the Earth receives the pulse, and consequently, information about the noise function φ2 much later after the

radio pulse has moved across the distance separating the pulsar from observer. Thus, the observer is allowed to think about

the pulsar timing noise as starting long time ago and the question arises about how to account for this nuisance ”memory”

eﬀect. Actually, the ”memory” eﬀect problem is not a speciﬁc of the timing noise only. It exists in treatment of observations

being corrupted by any low frequency noise. As far as we know the only paper, where the ”memory” eﬀect in pulsar timing

data processing has been discussed, is (Kopeikin 1997b). Therein, we have proved that the ”memory” eﬀect is negligibly

small under normal circumstances. Namely for this reason we have deliberately omitted any explicit dependence on time T

in formulae (5), (5) where the only really important time argument is the Solar system barycentric time t.

3 PROCEDURE OF ESTIMATION OF PULSAR PARAMETERS

We assume that all observations of the binary pulsar are of a similar quality and weight. Then one deﬁnes the timing residuals

r(t) as a diﬀerence between the observed number of the pulse, N obs, and the number N (t, θ), predicted on the ground of our

best guess to the prior unknown parameters of timing model (5), divided by the pulsar’s rotational frequency ν, that is

r(t, θ) =

N obs − N (t, θ)
ν

,

where θ = {θa, a = 1, 2, ...k} denotes a set of k measured parameters [k = 14 in the model (5)] which are shown in Table 1. It

is worth noting that hereafter we use for the reason of convinuence the time argument u = nbt.

If a numerical value of the parameter θa coincides with its true physical value ˆθa, then the set of residuals would represent

In practice, however, the true values of parameters are not attainable and we deal actually with their least square estimates

a. Therefore, observed residuals are ﬁtted to the expression which is a linear function of corrections to the estimates θ∗

that the basic functions ψ2a−1, (a = 1, ..., 7) are even , and ψ2a, a = 1, ..., 7 are odd. We restrict the model to 14 parameters

since in practice only the ﬁrst several parameters of the model are signiﬁcant in ﬁtting to the rotational and orbital phases

over the available time span of observations. It is also important to understand that the smaller amount of ﬁtting parameters

one takes, the more signiﬁcant the contribution of non-stationary part of low frequency noise (see discussion at the end of

this section).

where R(ti, tj) = < ǫ(ti)ǫ(tj) > is the autocovariance function of the stochastic process ǫ(t). The covariance matrix is

Subtraction of the adopted model from the observational data leads to the residuals which are dominated by the random

is called the ﬁlter function (Blandford et al. 1984). These expressions merely demonstrate that the amount of the background

noise is reduced by the ﬁt for the pulsar’s spin and orbital parameters (Bertotti et al. 1983, Blandford et al. 1984, Bard 1974).

Thus, the observed magnitude of residuals is on the average smaller than that of the noise. This is because we have chosen

the estimates θ∗

a for parameters so as to make the residuals as small as possible. Let us note that the more ﬁtting parameters

one has in the timing model, the smaller is the mean amplitude of residuals.

Another remarkable feature of (13) is that if the autocovariance function R(ti, tj) contains products of terms of the form

ψc(ti) × f (tj ), where f (tj ) is an arbitrary smooth function, they must disappear from the post-ﬁt residuals (Kopeikin 1997a).

The proof of the statement is based on two exact equalities:

power-law spectrum can be represented as a sum of terms being products of a polynomial of time g(t) = a0 + a1t + a2t2 + ...

by a smooth function of time f (t). This has been proved for a fairly general event of low-frequency noise being generated

by a shot noise random process (Kopeikin 1997b) and seems to be true, if not for all, at least for a considerable number of

stochastic processes. Taking large enough number of ﬁtting spin-down parameters and corresponding ﬁtting functions ψ(t)

one can represent the non-stationary component of noise as a sum of terms of the form ψ(ti) × f (tj ). Hence, residuals for the

example given do not contain the non-stationary component. In real practice, observers ﬁt usually for the ﬁrst three spin-down

parameters - initial rotational phase, frequency, and frequency derivative. Such a procedure eliminates from the residuals any

non-stationary noise components having spectral index n ≤ 6.

Moreover, we emphasize that the property of the ﬁtting procedure to ﬁlter out terms of the form of ψc(ti)f (tj ) does not

actually depend on whether observations are equally spaced. Hence, the conclusion is that, if the autocovariance function has

a non-stationary component comprised of a sum of terms of the form ψc(ti) × f (tj ), one can always make the post-ﬁt residuals

depending only on the stationary part of the noise

For this reason, methods of spectral analysis in frequency domain can be applied without any restriction.

To ﬁnd the asymptotic behavior of the residuals and elements of the covariance matrix as functions of time (or a number

of orbital revolutions N ) one needs to restrain a model of the stochastic noise process.

4 MODEL OF NOISE AND ITS AUTOCOVARIANCE FUNCTION

We have already assumed that noise consists of algebraic sum of mutually uncorrelated components of white and low-frequency

noises (see Eq.(5)). White noise is due to measuring uncertainty of TOA while the low-frequency noise has terrestrial and/or

astrophysical origin and becomes signiﬁcant only on long enough span of observational time. Investigation of its nature is

one of the most important problems of pulsar timing since it gives us a key to much better understanding of the very deep

fundamentals of physical laws governing the evolution of Nature on long time intervals. Especially important in this respect

are observations of millisecond pulsars in binary systems having the best attainable accuracy and, consequently, the low level

of white noise component in TOA residuals.

White noise is stationary and has a ﬂat constant spectrum

S(f ) = h0,

autocovariance function of white noise is

R(τ ) = h0δ(τ ),

with h0 being a ﬁxed parameter determined from the measured level of white noise on short time scales (see Eq. (42). The

where δ(τ ) is the Dirac delta function and τ = ti − tj with ti, tj being moments of TOA of the i-th and j-th observations.

The generalized model of low frequency noise was developed by Kopeikin (1997b) using the shot-noise approximation.

It can describe both random walk and ﬂicker noises having, as a rule, diﬀerent physical origins. The autocovariance function

of the noise includes both stationary and non-stationary components which are treated on equal footing. We suppose that

the autocovariance function of any stochastic process under consideration is a function of real variable and can be split

The function R+(ti, tj) describes the non-stationary part of the noise and R−(ti, tj) ≡ R−(|ti − tj|) is its stationary counter-

part. The latter can be displayed in the frequency domain through the cosine Fourier transform

algebraically into stationary and non-stationary components

R(ti, tj ) = R+(ti, tj ) + R−(ti, tj).

The stationary part of the red noise has a power-law spectrum, S(f ), being proportional to f −n where n is called the spectral

index of the noise and in the present paper n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Corresponding autocovariance functions of the stationary com-

ponents are represented by either polynomial of time (for random walk noise) or polynomial of time plus logarithmic function

of time multiplied by another polynomial of time (for ﬂicker noise). Nomenclature of the corresponding names of noises,

their spectra, and stationary part of the autocovariance functions are given in Table 2 which is an extract from (Kopeikin

1997b). Non-stationary parts of the autocovariance functions are expressed as a sum of terms of the form: [basic function

of ﬁtting procedure ψc(ti]) × [a smooth function f (tj)] and are given below in Section 7. As mentioned above, such terms

do not contribute to post-ﬁt timing residuals. However, they do contribute to the ﬁtted values of the pulsar’s spin parameters.

Before going further, let us discuss in more detail computational aspects of our analytical approach for calculation of

residuals and covariance matrices under the inﬂuence of diﬀerent noise processes.

5 COMPUTATIONAL ASPECTS

In order to accomplish all calculations analytically we assume that the number of observations is so large that any sum over

observing points can be approximated by the integral over the observing period T ∗. For calculational convenience, we assume

that observations are commenced at the moment t0 = −T ∗/2 and ﬁnished at t0 = T ∗/2 so that the interval of integration

time is symmetric with respect to the origin of time scale. Such a shift of the time scale is always possible and preserves the

invariance of timing formula (5). Moreover, we assume that observations are equally spaced with small enough interval of time

between successive observations △t = Pb/m where m is the number of observations per one orbital period. A total number

of orbital revolutions N is supposed to be large (N ≥ 30).

Under the given conditions one may apply to any smooth function f (t) ∈ C∞[−t0, t0] the Euler-Maclaurin summation

formula (2.9.15) given in textbook of Davis & Rabinowitz (1984) and having the form of an asymptotic expansion

It is not diﬃcult to check that the error E(m, N ) is decreasing, at least as (mN )−1 comparativly to the main term, or even

faster. It may be made small enough (less than 5observations per orbital period m ≥ 10 and the number of orbital revolutions

N ≥ 30) (Wex 1997). We assume, in what follows, that this condition is fulﬁlled and the residual terms E(m, N ) are negligibly

Because the autocovariance function consists of a linear combination of two terms representing non-stationary and sta-

tionary components, the covariance matrix (12) is split into two liearly independent terms as well:

small.

Mab = M +

ab + M −
ab,

where M +

ab depends only on R+(ti, tj) and M −

ab depends only on R−(ti, tj). Let us underline that the shift in the origin of

initial epoch of observations leads to the shift of arguments in the autocovariance functions ti → ti + T ∗/2, tj → tj + T ∗/2. It

leaves the stationary part of the autocovariance function R−(ti, tj ) invariant, depending on the diﬀerence ti − tj only, though

produces changes in the non-stationary part of R+(ti, tj) (see section 7 for more detail).

Calculations of integrals depending on the non-stationary part R+(ti, tj) of the autocovariance function are relatively easy

to handle. Let us remind that the function R+(ti, tj) for any noise model is composed of the ﬁnite sum of products of basic

functions ψl(ti)ψk(tj), (l, k ≤ 6) in the event of random walk noise to which functions having the structure ψl(ti) ln(nbtj + T),

l ≤ 3 are added in the event of ﬂicker noise (Kopeikin 1997b). On one hand, for random walk the corresponding part of the

covariance matrix will be

where δab is the unit matrix. On the other hand, in the event of ﬂicker noise one has additional contributions

Relationships (27)-(28) lead to the important conclusion that, for the timing model under consideration, the non-stationary

part of any autocovariance function contributes only to the elements of the covariance matrix Mab with indices a, b ≤ 6 for the

random walk noise, and to the elements of Mab = Mba with a ≤ 3, b = 1, 2, ...14 for the ﬂicker noise. This speciﬁc behaviour

of non-stationary part of autocovariance functions was noted partially by Groth (1975) in the context of his investigation of

random walk processes in pulsar timing based upon the usage of orthogonal polynomials. Our derivation of the given result is,

in fact, more general as it does not depend on the particular choice of special functions used for expansion of random process

and is applicable both to random walk and ﬂicker noises as well.

Calculations of integrals depending only on the stationary part of autocovariance function are fulﬁlled after making a

inverse matrix L−1

ab are also reduced to the block-diagonal form having the same structure as in (32). The advantage of this

re-arrangement is that one can work with each of the block matrices independently, simplifying the calculations considerably.

15

Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to remind that such simpliﬁcation can be achieved in the main approximation only. If one took

terms of higher order in the expansion (23) the re-arrangement of elements of matrix M −

ab would be worthless since odd and

even ﬁtting parameters get correlated. In such event one can make a progress in calculations only if numerical methods are

implied. This is the case one meets in a real practice.

In the analytical approximation under consideration the integral (30) was calulated using the enhanced version 2.2.3 of

MATHEMATICA for Microsoft Windows. It turns out that the outcome of calculation can be always expressed either as a

polynomial and trigonometric functions of time in the event of random walk, or as a polynomial, trigenometric functions, and

sine/cosine-integrals in the event of ﬂicker noise. Since the number of observations mN has been assumed to be very large

all functions appearing in elements of covariance matrix (30) have been expanded into asymptotic series with respect to the

small parameter ε = 1

πN ≡ 1

T . Then, only the ﬁrst term of the expansions has been retained and all residual terms have been

abandoned. An explicit result of such calcualtion is, for instance, the matrix of information Lab = m

2π Cab given in Tables 3

and 4. Analytical expressions for residuals and elements of covariance matrices of pulsar’s ﬁtting parameters in presence of

white and red noises are given in Section 7.

6 TREATMENT OF POLYNOMIAL DRIFT OF TIMING NOISE

For mathematical convenience, in this section we shall assume that the number of spin-down parameters of timing model

is equal to M and the total number of ﬁtting parameters is K ¶. Up to now, we have been concerned mainly with the

mathematical formulation of procedure of estimation of pulsar’s parameters under the assumption that noise has only random

ﬂuctuations, that is equation (11) is true. However, nonrandom variations (drifts) of the noise do exist and can be sometimes

modeled by deterministic polynomial functions of time as it takes place in description of electromagnetic breaking of pulsar’s

rotation. Hence, it is conceivable to imagine that the ensemble average of noise is modeled by a (P − 1)-th degree polynomial

Thus, we conclude that until number P of the polynomial’s coeﬃcients (33) is less or equal than number M of spin-down

parameters being used in deterministic timing model it changes only the mean values of the ﬁrst M parameters. In such event

one can make several more iterations in the procedure of minimization of square of residuals in order to eliminate completely

¶ In particular, the numbers M and K are equal to M = 6 and K = 14 respectively in the timing model described by equation (5)

numerical computations. It is worth emphasizing that even if it is the case, some ﬁtted parameters βa can, nevertheless, have

the mean value lying above the limit of the rounding error. We conclude that it is impossible to make the mean value for the

residuals and all ﬁtting parameters equals to zero if the number of spin-down parameters in timing model is less than number

of coeﬃcients in polynomial drift of the ensemble average of noise. This conclusion holds true for both white and red noise

Let us turn attention now to the calculation of residuals in the presence of polynomial drift of the noise’s ensemble average

regimes.

Thus, one can see that if the condition P < M + 1 holds, then the polynomial drift of noise does not contribute to the

ensemble mean value of square of timing residuals. In the opposite situation, when P ≥ M + 1, there extra contribution exist

and there is a danger of confusion of white noise having a polynomial drift with a red noise without such a drift.

Regarding covariance matrix of parameters in presence of polynomial drﬁt of noise it is not so diﬃcult to generalization

Herein, we have assumed that the non-stationary part of autocovariance function of noise R+(ti, tj) consists only of products

ψa(ti)f (tj) with a ≤ M .

Analayzing the structure of relationships (38)-(41) we draw the following conclusions: 1) if the number of coeﬃcients P

in the polynomial drift of noise is less than or equal to the number M of spin-down parameters in the timing model, then

it changes only non-stationary part M +

ab of the covariance matrix for spin-down parameters; -2) if the number of coeﬃcients

P in the polynomial drift of noise is more than or equal to the number M of spin-down parameters in the timing model,

then it inﬂuences the non-stationary part of the covariance matrix for spin-down and orbital parameters and gives rise to

∆Mab. Hence, if we do not account for the polynomial drift properly it may worsen numerical boundaries for true estimates

of variances and covariances of ﬁtting parameters.

At this point, it is worthwhile to emphasize that in order to make eﬀects of polynomial drift of noise as small as possible

one has to introduce to the timing model as many spin-down parameters as it is required by observational accuracy and

optimization of the least-square minimization procedure.

7 RESIDUALS, COVARIANCE MATRIX, AND VARIANCES OF MEASURED PARAMETERS

7.1 General Comments

In what follows we assume that eﬀect of ﬁtting spin-down parameters is so suppressive that the polynomial drift of the noise is

completely eliminated from all residuals and mean values of parameters. When calculating covariance matrices of parameters,

it is worth keeping in mind that if one takes only stationary components of low frequency noise it is not suﬃcient to demand the

variances of all ﬁtting parameters to be positive since the ﬁrst several spin-down parameters can have variances with negative

values (see Tables (9)-(16) for more detail). Negative variances are, of course, physically meaningless. Hence, we conclude that

it is incorrect to disregard the non-stationary part of red noise for it hampers the physical interpretation of these variances. It

turns out that, in order to obtain positive values for variances of all ﬁtted parameters, one must account for the contribution

from the non-stationary component of noise as well. This clearly demonstrates the role of the non-stationary noise component

in the ﬁtting procedure. The energy distribution amongst the ﬁtted parameters is such that the non-stationary part of red

noise contains as large amount of energy as the stationary part does (or even more) for the ﬁrst several parameters.

An additional point to note is that, if the number of spin-down parameters is not big enough, the non-stationary part

of the autocovariance function can not be represented as a linear combination of products of a smooth function f (t) by the

ﬁtting function ψa(t), and complete ﬁltering out non-stationary component of noise from residuals is impossible. In such a

case, if only the stationary part of the noise is accounted for and the non-stationary part is omitted, a negative mean value

of residuals can be obtained that is physically unadmissible. Taking into account the non-stationary noise component brings

the mean value of residuals back to the positive value. By this consideration, we would like to underline the role which

non-stationary part of noise plays in ﬁtting procedure. We consider those models of low frequency noise which take into

account only stationary component to be incomplete and can lead to erroneous results. For this reason, we are very careful

in dealing with the non-stationary noise component in order to properly take into account or to prove that it is insigniﬁcant

for calculations. In this context, let us note once again that we have made a shift of the time scale which changes the orbital

phase u 7→ u + πT and introduces additional terms in the non-stationary part of the autocovariance function in comparison

with expressions for R+(ti, tj) having been given in Kopeikin (1997b).

With these comments we are ready to demonstrate how white and red noise aﬀect pulsar timing residuals and covariance

matrices of ﬁtting parameters.

7.2 White Phase Noise

The spectral power of white noise is constant. For this reason, the timing residuals are constant as well

< r2 >= h0,

(42)

and the covariance matrix of measured parameters Mab coincides with the inverse matrix of information (10) L−1

ab . The matrix

of information Lab = m

2π Cab, and the elements of the inverse matrix C −1

ab are given in Tables 3 - 6.

On multiplying the main diagonal of L−1

ab by the magnitude of the measurement error h0 yields the variances of the measured

parameters. One can see that precision of the parameter determination depends both on the rate of making observations m and

on the number of orbital revolutions N during the observational session. This is a distinctive feature of timing measurements

in the event when white noise is the only source of errors. We also note that as the observational span T increses the variances

of all parameters decrease. Thus, until white noise dominates in observed timing residuals, the accuracy of determination of all

parameters will be improved. It is worth emphasizing as well that there is a similarity in the precision of determination of spin

and orbital parameters. Indeed, if one compares variances for the rotational phase and its time derivatives with corresponding

quantities for orbital motion one ﬁnds that dependence on T is essentially the same. For making this statement more obvious

we give relationships between orbital parameters and parameters of the timing model shown in Table 1

Calculation of variances of orbital parameters is accomplished using results shown in Tables 3-6. It is remarkable that there

is a symmetry between variances of odd and even parameters of the timing model, so that in case of white noise dominance

one has, for example, < β2

7 >=< β2

8 >, and so on. Because of this symmetry there is no dependence of variances of orbital

parameters on the initial orbital phase σ. From equations (43)-(50) we have

which can be easily compared with variances of corresponding spin-down parameters in Tables 5, 6. In particular, we ﬁnd

that ratio of root squares of variances of the spin-down parameters to corresponding parameters describing time evolution

of orbital phase is approximately equal to x/Pb, that is < δN0/ν > / < δT0 >∼ x/Pb, < δν/ν > / < δPb/Pb >∼ x/Pb,

< δ ˙ν/ν > / < δ ˙Pb/Pb >∼ x/Pb, etc. As a concequence of this observation we conclude that in the case of domination of white

noise spin-down parameters of binary pulsars are always determined better than corresponding parameters of orbital phase.

7.3 Flicker Noise in Phase (1/f noise)

Pulsar timing residuals grow with time according to the relationship

< r2 >= h1

ln(2T) −

101

,

i

h

where h1 is a constant number characterizing intensity of the noise.

R+(ti, tj) = h1 [ln(u + T) + ln(v + T)] ,

and can be expressed through the basic functions

R+(ti, tj) = h1 [ψ1(v) ln(u + T) + ψ2(u) ln(v + T)] .

The non-stationary part of autocovariance function for PN random walk is represented as (Kopeikin 1997b):

From equation (28), the contribution from the non-stationary part of the ﬂicker noise to the covariance matrix is given by the

It is clear from (62) that the only non-zero elements of the matrix M +

ab can be M +

component is the contribution of the non-stationary part to the variance of the ﬁrst measured parameter

M +

11 = −

+ 2 ln(2T)

The matrix M −

ab is generated by the stationary part of the autocovariance function and is given in Tables 5 and 8. Let us note

that, as expected, variances of all measured parameters including the ﬁrst one are positive quantities.

Comparing results of the variance calculations with those obtained in previous section for white noise we note that ﬂicker

noise in phase worsen our ability in determining variances of spin-down parameters. At the same time ﬂicker noise does

not disturb variances of orbital parameters and symmetry between pairs of odd and even parameters. For this reason, using

general formulae (43)-(50) one can see that variances of the orbital parameters do not depend on the initial orbital phase σ

and have the same dependence on the total span of observation T as it was in case of white noise. We would like to emphasize

the appearance of logarithmic terms in timing residuals and the covariance matrices given in Tables 5 and 8. Logarithmic

terms are characteristic for any ﬂicker noise as it will be shown in subsequent sections. However, practical observation of the

logarithmic terms in temporal behaviour of residuals and variances of measured parameters is a challenge for observers since

it is diﬃcult to distinguish ln T from constant if observational span is not long enough. Perhaps, this explains why logarithmic

behavior of timing residuals and variances have not been yet found and ﬂicker noise with spectral index s = 1 has not been

ever identiﬁed in pulsar timing observations.

Stationary part of the PN noise gives the covariance matrix displayed in Tables 9 and 10. One can see that the random

walk in phase makes it impossible to track the rotational phase of the pulsar after amount of orbital revolutions exeeds

(2816π)/(659ν 2h2) ≃ 13.4/(ν 2h2) since the moment when random walk in phase becomes the dominant source of noise in

timing residuals. In this case the parameter N0 becomes non-informativek. All other spin-down parameters can be measured

but accuracy of their measurement is lower comparatively to the cases of white and/or ﬂicker noises in phase. On the other

k A parameter is called informative if its mean numerical value obtained in the ﬁtting procedure is much less than its variance. In the
opposite case, the parameter is called non-informative. We also call the initial rotational and orbital phases, N0 and σ, informative
parameters if their variances do not exeed 2π. From a physical point of view, some of the ﬁtting parameters become non-informative

hand, time dependence of variances of orbital parameters is the same as it was in the case of white noise. Hence, we are

still able to determine the initial orbital phase σ, orbital frequency nb, and so on. However, the symmetry between pairs of

corresponding odd and even parameters of the timing model under consideration is not preserved. For this reason, accuracy

in determination of variances of orbital parameters slightly depends on the initial orbital phase (which remains to be the

informative parameter).

The stationary part of the covariance matrix M −

ab is given in Tables (11) and (12). Sum of matrices M +

ab and M −

ab gives positive

numerical values to variances of all measured parameters.

Flicker noise in frequency, if it dominates in timing residuals, will not improve the accuracy in determination of the initial

rotational phase and frequency. Moreover, variance of the initial rotational phase grows as span of observations increases.

Information about numerical value of the initial rotational phase will be completely lost when the root square of the variance

when the ratio of red timing noise to the deterministic signal (5) exeeds a certain level. The stage at which this happens may be found
from comparision of the mean values of the parameters and their variances.

becomes equal to 2π. Taking into account the non-stationary component (70) of the covariance matrix we ﬁnd that it happens

after amount of orbital revolutions N exeeds ∼ 2/(νh1/2

). For single pulsars, this corresponds to a time interval of about

∼ 2/(νh1/2

3

) years after which the initial rotational phase becomes the non-informative parameter. We also note that variances

of the rotational frequency ν and initial orbital phase σ can not be determined better than their values obtained before the

ﬂicker noise in frequency has commenced to corrupt observations. Symmetry in variances of corresponding pairs of odd and

even orbital parameters is completely destroyed. One interesting consequence of this phenomena is that the measurement

precision of orbital parameters in the presence of ﬂicker noise crucially depends on numerical value of the initial orbital

phase until it remains to be informative parameter. For example, from equations (44) and (52) one can see that if we arrange

observational data to have σ ≃ 0 then parameter ˙x is determined better than the orbital frequency nb. Inversly, if observational

data are prepared to make σ ≃ π/2 then the rotational frequency may be measured better than ˙x. The situation looks similar

to that existing in the quantum mechanical non-demolition experiments (Braginsky & Khalili 1992) in which the quantum

the same time losing information about the other conjugate one.

Certain cases in D’Alessandro et al. (1997), for which the derived spectra of the observed timing residuals show spectral

indices n = 3, 5, could well be indicators of the ﬂicker noise of the respective kind.

The stationary part of the noise gives the covariance matrix displayed in Tables 13 and 14.

Random walk in frequency signiﬁcantly contributes to variances of the ﬁrst three spin-down parameters so that the

initial rotational phase and frequency become non-informative parameters. Rotational frequency derivative continues to be

the informative parameter but precision of its measurement remains constant and can not be improved anymore. This has a

direct consequence on our ability to use rotational motion of the pulsar as a time scale (for more detail see Section 8).

Random walk in frequency also converts the initial orbital phase or semi-major axis of the binary pulsar from the

informative to the non-informative parameters. Indeed, equations (43), (47) and variances of parameters β7, β8 taken from

We can see that if σ has been determined prior to the moment when the random walk in frequency begins to dominate, and its

numerical value was not close to π/2 or 3π/2, then the information about this value is lost after (2860πx2)/(3h4) ≃ 2995x2/h4

orbital revolutions. In the case when σ is close to π/2 or 3π/2 the information will be lost about parameter x. Arranging

observations in the interval before random walk begins a dominant source of the noise we can preserve information either

about numerical value of σ or x parameters. If the initial orbital phase becomes the non-informative parameter one has to

average equations (43)-(50) with respect to σ under assumption that distribution of probability for this parameter is uniform

and concentrated in the interval from 0 to 2π (Bard 1974).

of numerical values of parameters - ˙ν,

which was obtained at preceding epoch when timing noise was not so red. This has a consequence for stability of the, so called,

binary pulsar time (BPT) scale (Ilyasov, Kopeikin & Rodin 1998) which is discussed in section 8. Flicker noise in frequency

may be produced by the stochastic gravitational wave background. Detailed discussion of the analysis of timing data from

binary pulsars in the presence of this noise is given by Kopeikin (1997a).

8 KINEMATIC AND DYNAMIC PULSAR TIME SCALES

In this section we discuss stability of time scales based on kinematic rotation of pulsars (PT scale) and orbital motion of

pulsar in a binary system (BPT scale). This comprehensive analysis can be done due to using results of calculation of timing

residuals and covaraince matrices given in the preceding sections.

The methodology of applying pulsar timing data to fundamental metrology and time keeping service was explicitly

formulated by Russian astronomers in 1979 (Shabanova et al. 1979, see also Ilyasov et al. 1989). Subsequent timing observations

deﬁnitely proved consistency of this approach and made it clear that PT scale has a stability comparable with that of atomic

clocks being placed in metrological centres (Ilyasov et al. 1989, Ginot and Petit 1991, Kaspi et al. 1994). However, it does not

mean that one should stop looking for other natural periodic physical phenomena which might be used for generating time

scales being even more stable than PT. A new possibility to explore the problem is creation and maintenance of modiﬁed

ephemeris time (ET) of classical astronomy based not on the orbital motion of planets in the Solar system (Guinot 1989) but

on the orbital motion of pulsar in a close binary system (Petit and Tavella 1996, Ilyasov et al. 1998). It has been theoretically

justiﬁed (Damour 1987, Kopeikin 1985, Sch¨afer 1985) and observationally conﬁrmed with accuracy 0.4% (Damour and Taylor

1991, 1992) that orbital motion of pulsar in a binary system is governed by laws of General Relativity. For this reason one can

predict the orbital motion of pulsar with extremely high precision on very long time intervals larger than 10 years generating

in this way the new time scale BPT. However, the principal question arises about the limit on the stability of such time scale

in the presence of red stochastic noise process in pulsar timing residuals. We answer this question in the present section.

8.1 Binary pulsars as time keeping standards

Standards of time and frequency have three important characteristics: (1) frequency stability, (2) reproduction of the time

scale unit, and (3) the span of life time. Regarding these characteristics we note that the life time of binary pulsars reaches

106 years and more which makes them very long-lived time standards. Orbital motion of pulsar in a close binary system is

practically not subjected to external gravitational perturbations. For this reason the orbital motion has a very high intrinsic

stability allowing reproduction of duration of one orbital revolution to very high precision. Binary pulsar time scale - BPT

(Petit & Tavella 1996, Ilyasov et al. 1998) can be constructed according to the formula

T = T0 + PbN +

˙PbN 2,

1
2

(106)

where T0 is an initial epoch for orbital phase, N is the number of orbital revolutions, Pb and ˙Pb are the orbital period and its

time derivative reﬀered to the initial epoch T0. This equation does not contain terms depending on high-order time derivatives

of the orbital period as they equal identically to zero in the barycentric reference frame of the binary system (Kopeikin 1985,

Kopeikin and Potapov 1994). However, radial acceleration of the binary system with respect to observer and its proper motion

in the sky bring about appearance of the second and next high-order time derivatives both of Pb (Damour & Taylor 1992, Bell

& Bailes 1996) and of the projected semi-major axis of the pulsar’s orbit (Kopeikin 1996, 1997a)(see equation (5) for more

detail). These eﬀects change the intrinsic values of Pb and ˙Pb and make more diﬃcult their determination from observations.

An additional serious problem arises with the possible presence in TOA the low-frequency noise of astrophysical origin.

Indeed, intrinsic rotational motion of pulsar may be perturbed by the random walk in phase and/or its time derivatives

(Cordes & Greenstein 1981), interstellar medium and relic stochastic gravitational waves change randomly propagation of

electromagnetic pulses from the pulsar to observer being the reason for contamination of timing residuals by ﬂicker noise

(Mashhoon & Grishchuk 1980, Bertotti et al. 1983, Blandford et al. 1984, Backer & Foster 1990, Kopeikin 1997a). As a result,

timing residuals represent a pure deterministic process upon which the stohastic additive noise is imposed. This noise consists

of mixture of white noise of errors of observations and the low-frequency red noise of astrophysical origin. The spectrum S(f )

of the red noise is described in Table 2. It contains both stationary and non-stationary components (Kopeikin 1997b). The

c(cid:13) 1994 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–39

33

presence of the red noise makes speciﬁc restrictions on the stability of both PT and BPT time scales which we brieﬂy discuss

in what follows. More detail on the subject may be found in the paper by Ilyasov, Kopeikin & Rodin (1998).

8.2 BPT scale and its stability

A complete treatment of the problem under consideration requires rather combersome calculations. In order to avoid mathe-

matical diﬃculties we restrict ourselves to a simpliﬁed model of a binary system with the pulsar on the circular orbit so that

all results of previous sections can be applied without any restrictions. Our goal is to get the optimal estimate of measured

stability of BPT on the background of additive, low-frequency red noise in TOA. This problem had been partially considered

(see, for instance, Van Trees 1968, Tikhonov 1983). Unfortunately, the methods developed in most previous publications can

not be applied directly in our study so that we need to rely upon our own approach. In the problem under consideration

the signal represents a linear combination of rotational phase of the pulsar, which is given by a polynomial of time, and

quasi-periodic sinusoidal function with the argument being the orbital phase which is also a polynomial of time. As we have

assumed the noise is additive to the signal, we can use the functional expression for the analyzed signal in the form:

ξ(t) = N (t, βa) + ǫ(t),

0 ≤ t ≤ τ ,

(107)

where N (t, βa) is function of time describing deterministic part of the signal, depending on measured parameters βa, and

given by equation (5); ǫ(t) is a random process with the autocorrelation function given in Table 2, τ is the total span of

observational time. We also assume that observations are evenly spaced along the orbit with frequency m. It has allowed us

to replace in all sums by integrals and to treat the stochastic process ǫ(t) as continuous.

For an adequate treatment of stability of time scales PT and BPT it is convenient to introduce two new parameters

y = δν/ν and v = δnb/nb, where δν and δnb represent diﬀerences between true physical value of the parameter in question

and its estimate obtained by the least squares method when ﬁtting TOA of the pulsar. Variances of estimates of rotational

and orbital frequencies (σ2

y, and, σ2

v, respectively) are convenient for comparing stability of two time scales - dynamic BPT

and kinematic PT. Mathematical expressions for these variances are called true variances (Rutman 1978) and represent the

close analogue of the Allan variance being used in fundamental metrology for analysing stability of time-frequency standards.

Expressions for σv and σy crucially depend on the type of noise present and can be evaluated from the variance of β2 and from

equation (44) and variances β7, β8. Their explicit dependence on the amplitude of noise hs, s = 0, 1, 2, . . . , 6 and duration of

the total span of observations τ are given in Table 19 and are ploted schematically in Fig. 2 where the horizontal axis shows

the total span of observations τ and vertical axis numerates values of the parameters σy and σv. It is worth emphasizing

that σy can not depend on orbital parameters of the pulsar because it characterizes instability of the intrinsic rotational

frequency of the pulsar and, for this reason, can not be related with its orbital motion. On the other hand, the quantity σv

naturally depends on the orbital period of the binary Pb = 2π/nb and its projected semi-major axis x since these parameters

characterize frequency and amplitude of the orbital sine wave in timing residuals. Additional functional dependence of σv

on the initial orbital phase σ in the case of random walk in phase is explained by the fact that the orbital frequency of the

binary is one of the quadrature component of the sine function (the second quadrature component is the ﬁrst time derivative

Figure 2. Characteristic behavior of variances characterizing stability of intrinsic rotational frequency of pulsar σy and that of the
orbital frequency of the binary system σv . In the case of evenly spaced observations theoretically predicted ratio σy/σv is equal to
1.75π x/Pb ≃ 10−3 ÷ 10−4 until white noise dominates in timing residuals. Displacement of two curves in subsequent moments of time
depends on the relative magnitude of white and red noise components.

of the projected semi-major axis ˙x as follows from the deﬁnition of parameters β9 and β10 given in Table 1). Low-frequency

red noise with spectral index s = 2 distroys an equilibrium in the accuracy of simultaneous determination of the quadrature

components and leads to the dependence of σv on the parameter σ. In the case of red noise with index s ≥ 3 the initial orbital

phase is the non-informative parameter. Thus, we have averaged the variances with respect to σ which, for this reason, does

not appear in the corresponding expressions for σv.

In constructing Fig. 2 we have assumed that during the time interval [τ0, τ1] white phase noise dominates. This noise is

caused by the presence of errors of measurements in TOA and, possibly, by the uncorrelated noise in the intrinsic rotation of

35

the pulsar. Various components of the low-frequency red noise commence to appear on time intervals τ > τ1. Their amplitudes

hs, as the experience of working with atomic clocks shows, gradually decrease as the spectral index s of the noise increases.

For instance, in the model being considered in Fig. 2 the red ﬂicker noise with spectral density S(f ) ≃ h1/f dominates in

timing residuals from the moment τ1 till τ2. Then, starting from the moment τ2 up to τ3 the random walk in phase with the

spectral density S(f ) ≃ h2/f 2 dominates, and so on. In general, we assume that the longer time interval of observations the

more signiﬁcant the contribution of the red noise with higher numerical value of the spectral index s. Such behavior relates

to the fact that usually the red noise with higher spectral index has lower intensity (that is, smaller amplitude hs) and can

give rise to a noticable contribution only on longer time interval τ from the beginning of observation.

It is interesting to note that behavior of σy(τ ) is reminiscent of the, so-called, narrow-band frequency dispersion used in

the fundamental metrology for characterizing stability of time-frequency standards when low-frequency noise is dominating

(Rutman, 1978). However, in the timing model under consideration, σy(τ ), turns out to be signiﬁcantly dependent on the

non-stationary part of red noise with the spectral indices s = 3 or high (see Table 19). As there is no satisfactory theoretical

model of the non-stationary component such dependence of σy(τ ) is an indication of necessity of working out the other, more

practical approach for estimation of the variance characterizing stability of intrinsic rotational motion of pulsar and PT scale.

It seems that the modiﬁed measure of the variance, which is called σz instead of σy, introduced by Taylor (1992) and based on

the using of mathematical technique of transfer ﬁlter functions in spectral frequency domain is rather constructive and fruitful

step ahead toward this direction. In particular, Matsakis et al. (1997) have recently derived the explicit expression for σz(τ )

which is proportional to the second time derivative of pulsar’s rotational frequency ˙ν. We have used our analytic estimation

of pulsar parameters in timing model (5) in order to calculate σz. Results of the calculations is shown in Table 19 along

with σy and σv. We conﬁrm the statement of Matsakis et al. (1997) that function σz is independent from the non-stationary

component of red noise. Moreover, it does not contain slow logarithmic trends explicitly appearing in σy for ﬂicker noises with

indices s = 3 and s = 5.

Comparing the σz statistic with σv we ﬁnd that σv is not sensitive to the non-stationary component of red noise as well

as σz, and does not contain the logarifmic trends. However, σv may depend on the initial orbital phase for red noises with

indices s ≥ 2 if span of observational time is not long enough to make that parameter to be non-informative. Our calculations

also clearly show that measured value of the variance σv(τ ) is not sensitive to red noise with index s ≤ 2 and, for this reason,

does not allow one to distingiush such red noise from the white one. Nevertheless, this speciﬁc behavior of σv(τ ) opens a

possibility of using orbital motion of the pulsar as a new time reference being more stable than PT scale on longer intervals.

Indeed, as one can see in Fig. 2, function σy(τ )⋆⋆ describing stability of PT scale begins to grow from the moment τ3 but σv(τ )

characterizing stability of BPT scale continues to decrease until the red noise with spectral index s ≥ 5 begins to dominate.

This relative behavior of two variances is quite general and does not depend on the speciﬁc numerical value of intensities

of red noise. Theoretical analysis reveals, that the minimum of σv(τ ) is reached signiﬁcantly later than that of σy(τ ) (and

⋆⋆ Behavior of σz is more representative for characterizing stability of PT scale. However, graphic behavior of σy looks approximately
the same as that of σz.

σz(τ ) respectively). Depth of the minimum for σy(τ ) (and σz(τ ) depends on the noise with spectral index s = 3 which is

produced by the large-scale inhomogeneities of the interstellar medium (Blandford et al. 1984). Depth of the minimum for

σv(τ ) depends on the amplitude of noises with spectral indecies s = 5 which exist due to the stohastic background of relic

gravitational radiation produced by physical processes in early universe (Mashhoon & Grishchuk 1980, Bertotti et al. 1983,

Kopeikin 1997a). In principle, noise with spectral index s = 5 may arise also as a result of random ﬂuctuations of the ﬁrst

time derivative of intrinsic rotational frequency of the pulsar (Cordes & Greenstein 1981). The existence of such ﬂuctuations

is extremely unlikely and, for this reason, they are not discussed in the following discussion. As an example we specify the

numerical value of the minimum of σz(τ ) for a single millisecond pulsar PSR B1937+21 which reach 10−14 on time interval 2-3

years. Existence of the minimum with subsequent turning-up of the curve σz(τ ) for this pulsar is explained by the dominance

of random instabilities in the rotational phase of the pulsar (Kaspi et al. 1994).

It is remarkable from principal and practical points of view that depth of the absolute minimum for the function, σv(τ ), can

be predicted with a high degree of certainty. It is deﬁned by the amplitude of the relic stochastic gravitational wave background

radiation with spectral index s = 5. More speciﬁcally, for binary pulsars with circular orbits the depth of minimum of σv(τ )

is deﬁned by the expression:

σv ≃ 1.2 · 10−20

where Ωg is energy density of stochastic gravitational wave background radiation per logarithmic unit interval of frequency,

Pb is the orbital period of the binary measured in seconds, x is the projected semi-major axis of the pulsar’s orbit measured in

seconds, h is the Hubble constant in units 100 km c−1Mpc−1. It is worthwhile to point out (as the formula (108) shows) that

numerical value of the minimum for σv(τ ) depends not only on the magnitude of fundamental cosmological parameters Ωg and

h but on the numerical values of orbital parameters of the binary system as well. Of course, for binary pulsars with elliptical

orbits formula (5) will also include dependence on the eccentricity of the orbit. We shall consider this more complicated case

elsewhere.

Formula (108) yields the absolute (fundamental) value of the minimum for σv(τ ). However, the real minimum of σv(τ )

depends signiﬁcantly on the amplitude of noise with spectral index s = 6. If the amplitude of this noise is less than that

of the stochastic noise of gravitational wave backround radiation, then the real minimum of σv(τ ) coincides with absolute

minimum given by formula (108). In the opposite case the minimum of σv(τ ) will be located above the absolute minimum

(108). In any case, the observed numerical value of minimum for σv(τ ) may, in principle, reach the level 10−15 ÷ 10−16 under

assumption that Ωgh2 ≤ 10−8 (Starobinsky 1979, Vilenkin 1981, Rubakov et al. 1982). The result obtained can be used in

two ways. First, existence of fundamental minimum for σv(τ ) allows to search for (or to establish the upper limit on) the

stochastic gravitational wave radiation by means of using binary pulsars with long orbital periods and large ratio of Pb/x

which is necessary for reducing the absolute value of minimum of σv(τ ) as much as possible. That will reduce the interval of

time τ being required in order to reach the minimum. Second, using binary pulsars with short orbital periods and small ratio

of Pb/x one can make the minimum of σv(τ ) as deep as possible in order to make the interval of stability of BPT scale as

long as possible. We argue that determination of numerical value of minimum of σv(τ ) from observations may give very likely

more precise indicator of the upper limit on the energy density of stochastic gravitational radiation than measuring the slope

of function σz(τ ). The matter is that determination of minimum of σv(τ ) is more statistically reliable than one of the slope

of σz(τ ) which depends to a large extent on uncertainty in calculation of errors of measurement of the curve on long time

intervals (Kaspi et al. 1994).

9 CONCLUSIONS

We have done analytic calculations of time dependence of residuals and covariance matrix of ﬁtting parameters of a binary

pulsar under assumption that observations are evenly spaced. The results have been used to estimate the observed stability of

intrinsic rotational and orbital frequencies of the pulsar. It was shown that the dynamic time scale BPT may be more stable

under certain circumstances than the kinematic PT scale. It was clariﬁed that stability of BPT is restricted (like that of PT)

by the presence of red noise even when the orbital motion of the pulsar can be considered as pure deterministic. Nevertheless,

this restriction on stability of BPT is important only if observations are run on time intervals being signiﬁcantly longer than

characteristic time of instability of PT. This remarkable property of BPT leads us to hope that its usage may help in future

to undertake deeper analysis of laws of gravitational physics. There is no doubt that long-term stability of BPT time scale

makes it as a useful practical tool for fundamental metrology of time.

Investigation of problem of construction and maintanace of BPT scale for studing various problems of modern astronomy

relates tightly to the problem of identiﬁcation of nature and spectral characteristic of timing noise presenting in TOA. There

is a hope that publication of papers of Deshpande et al. (1996) and D’Alessandro et al. (1997) devoted to detailed discussion

of timing noise in the case of a sample of 18 single pulsars will attract a new interest to this problem. In particular, a reader

of these papers will ﬁnd a handful cases where the slopes are possibly more consistent with the spectral indices n = 3, 5 etc.

than say n = 4, 6. Of course, the uncertainty in some of these cases is large but still there is an indicative support for the

ﬂicker noise cases.

Theoretical development of ideas relating to the study of stability of BPT time scale can be continued in several directions.

Probably, one should consider binary pulsars with elliptical orbits having maximal ratio Pb/x which can improve quality of

the time scale and, consequently, testing General Relativity in the strong ﬁeld regime. In this problem it will be necessary

to take into account possible variations of orbital elements of the binary caused by diﬀerent, not well predicted factors, like

ﬂybys of stars or gravitational waves with frequncies being close to the orbital one (Chicone et al. 1998). It is not so diﬃcult

to show that for the BPT it is preferable to take binary pulsars with small enough ratio mp/mc (mp and mc are masses of

pulsar and its companion respectively), long semi-major axis of the pulsar’s orbit ap, short orbital period Pb, and sin i ≃ 1,

that is large x = ap sin i/c. It would be desirable and worthwhile to create a network of reference binary pulsars and start

their continuous timing observations in leading radio astronomical observatories of the world in order to make the concept of

BPT time scale practically available as soon as possible.

Abstract

We study phase synchronization between atmospheric variables such as daily mean
temperature and daily precipitation records. We ﬁnd signiﬁcant phase synchroniza-
tion between records of Oxford and Vienna as well as between the records of precip-
itation and temperature in each city. To ﬁnd the time delay in the synchronization
between the records we study the time lag phase synchronization when the records
are shifted by a variable time interval of days. We also compare the results of the
method with the classical cross-correlation method and ﬁnd that in certain cases
the phase synchronization yields more signiﬁcant results.

1 Introduction

In recent years there was much interest in long term persistence of tempera-
ture records [1] detected by Detrended Fluctuation Analysis [2]. Fluctuations
in space and time of meteorologic records are usually characterized by Tele-
connection Patterns [3]. They describe recurring and persistent patterns of
circulation anomalies that take place in huge geographical domains. Promi-
nent patterns are the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) that appears all over

the year, or the East Atlantic Pattern (EA), which appears from Septem-
ber to April. Each site in the Teleconnection Patterns is characterized by the
strength of the cross-correlation of this site with all other sites in the pattern,
for a given meteorologic parameter. By this, a correlation matrix is deﬁned,
which usually exhibits two to four regions of extreme high or low values, which
are called ”centers of action”. A more recent measure is the Rotated Princi-
pal Component Analysis (RCPA), which uses eigenvectors of the correlation
(or cross-covariance) matrix after certain scaling and rotation to identify the
meteorologic patterns.

The methods to identify teleconnection patterns are based on cross-correlation
which essentially compares the amplitude records. Here we suggest an alter-
native method for studying relations between meteorological records, which is
based on the phase synchronization approach [4]. We show that this method
can be applied also to complex signals where the ﬂuctuations are not pure
oscillations. For certain meteorological records, we ﬁnd that the phase syn-
chronization approach performs better than the conventional cross-correlation
approach. The method also enables to quantify the typical wavelengths of a
signal, which cannot be detected by cross-correlation.

The paper is organized as follows: We describe the phase synchronization
method in Section 2, present the results in Section 3 and discuss and summa-
rize them in Section 4.

2 Phase Synchronization Method

The Phase Synchronization Method was originally applied to weakly coupled
chaotic oscillators. The method enables to reveal relations between two com-
plex records by focusing on the phases of the ﬂuctuations in each record. The
technique was found very useful for identifying phase synchronization in sev-
eral biological systems, including the synchronization between the breathing
cycle and the heart rhythm [5], which reveals the weak interaction between
the human respiratory and the cardiovascular system. Analysis of synchroniza-
tion has also been performed in ecological systems, where complex population
oscillations occur [6]. For more applications and a pedagogical review of the
method we refer to [7].

Generally, two periodic oscillators are in resonance, if their frequencies ω1 and
ω2 are related by

nω1 ≈ mω2

,

(1)

where n,m are integers. We deﬁne a phase φj(t) = ωjt for each oscillator, and

2

the generalized phase-diﬀerence is ϕn,m = nφ1(t) − mφ2(t). Hence we have
resonance for the condition

|ϕn,m − δ| < const.

,

where δ represents the phase shift between both oscillators, and the constant
on the r.h.s. is any positive ﬁnite number. This condition holds also when
the frequencies are ﬂuctuating. In this case, φj(t) is calculated for each single
record by using a Hilbert transform (see below). In order to test for phase
synchronization, we determine [8]

ψn,m = ϕn,m mod 2π .

If the histogram of ψn,m shows a maximum at a certain phase-diﬀerence, the
two records are synchronized at this phase.
In practice, the phase synchronization analysis of two records of length N
consists of ﬁve steps:

• In the ﬁrst step, we construct from the scalar signals τj(t), j = 1, 2, the
complex signals ζj(t) = τj(t) + iτHj (t) = Aj(t)eiφj (t), where τHj (t) is the
Hilbert transform of τj(t) [9].

• Then we extract the phases φ1(t) and φ2(t).
• Next we cumulate the phases such that every cycle, the phases φj(t) increase

by 2π.

• Then we quantify the diﬀerence of the phases ϕn,m(t) = nφ1(t) − mφ2(t).
• Finally, we create a histogram of ψn,m = ϕn,m mod 2π for various m and n
values. To do this, we subdivide the possible range of the phases ψn,m into
M intervals (bins) of size 2π/M and determine how often the phase ψn,m
occurs in each interval.

In the absence of phase synchronization, the histogram of ψn,m is expected to
be uniform, because all phase-diﬀerences occur with the same probability. In
the presence of phase synchronization, there exists, for a certain pair (m, n) a
peak in the histogram.

To quantify the signiﬁcance of synchronization we use an index [8] based on
the Shannon entropy S:

(2)

(3)

(4)

ρn,m =

Smax − S
Smax

,

where S = − PM
k=1 pk ln pk and pk is the probability of ﬁnding ψn,m in the k-th
bin of the histogram. By deﬁnition, the maximum entropy is Smax = ln M.
The synchronization index is restricted to the unit interval 0 ≤ ρn,m ≤ 1 and
is minimal for a uniform distribution and maximal in the case of a δ-function.

3

By introducing a time lag into the phase synchronization method, realized
by a certain shifting interval S between the two records, it may occur, that
for some cases best phase synchronization is found only for a certain time
lag. In this case, the synchronization is delayed by this interval, which can be
determined by the position of the peak in the synchronization index.

3 Results

We begin the demonstration of the method on the temperature and precipi-
tation records of Oxford (GBR) and Vienna (AUT). The stations are distant
enough in order not to give trivial results, but of suﬃcient closeness for their
climate to interact. In order to analyze only the ﬂuctuations, we deseasoned
the records by subtracting the annual cycles. We mostly discuss the temper-
ature time series. The values for the ﬁrst hundred days of the year 1873 for
both cities are shown in Fig. 1. Although some similarities can be guessed, the
question how to quantify these similarities is of interest. One method is the
cross-correlation approach. Here we propose that complementary information
can be revealed by the phase synchronization method.

Figs. 2 and 3 demonstrate the steps of the method. In Fig. 2(a) a small section
of the temperature record measured at Oxford is given. The corresponding
phases (Fig. 2(b)) were determined using Hilbert transform. Fig. 2(c) shows
what the cumulated phases look like, where after every cycle 2π is added. In
Fig. 3(a) the cumulated phases for both complete records are shown, while
in Fig. 3(b) the phase-diﬀerences are displayed. The histogram of the phase-
diﬀerences modulo 2π, is given in Fig. 3(c). A clear peak can be seen in the
histogram and the synchronization index is ρ = 0.0242. This value can not be
improved by taking n:m other than 1:1.

To get information about the signiﬁcance of this result we perform time lag
phase synchronization, i.e. a shifting-test, where the series are shifted against
each other by a given interval of S days. The non-overlapping values in both
sequences are ignored for the process. Obviously in the case of no synchro-
nization the value of ρ must be lower than in synchronization. In Fig. 4(a) the
result of shifting is shown. For shifting of several days in both directions the
synchronization decreases dramatically. A histogram for a shift of +20 days,
where ρ = 0.0011, is given in Fig. 4(c). This shifting-test reveals, that the
non-shifted case does not correspond to the best synchronization. A higher
synchronization index (ρ = 0.0315) can be achieved with a shift of -1 day. Fig.
4(b) shows this histogram. The peak is slightly sharper and higher than in Fig.
3(c). This result is reasonable since a cycle of ﬂuctuation which is detected in
Oxford reaches Vienna (due to high latitude western winds) about one day
later.

4

The results are less pronounced for the two precipitation time records. The
shifting-test is displayed in ﬁgure 5(a). Here the importance of the shifting-test
becomes clear. Even when shifted, ρ-values of the order of 0.004 are achieved,
but the peak is still signiﬁcantly higher. This high background is probably
due to the large ﬂuctuations of the precipitation records. They show a spiky
structure, that leads the Hilbert transform to give many slips and phases of
short duration. Indeed, apart from the long cycles, these records consist of
many of 3 to 4-day-periods (shown in Fig. 6(b)). When a pair of precipitation
records is shifted, the phases still show matching because of the multitude of
very short periods, yielding noise-induced synchronization in the background.
Nevertheless a dominant peak is obtained in this representation, the maximum
synchronization with ρ = 0.0072 is reached when the series are shifted by -2
days. Note that this value is a factor 4 smaller than that for temperature.
Synchronization is also found between temperature and precipitation records
at the same site. In Oxford the temperature and precipitation records are
very weakly synchronized (Fig. 5(b)), with a small peak of ρ = 0.0009. At
Vienna (Fig. 5(c)) the peak is at least six times larger. In both cases the peaks
are located at a time lag of +1 day, i.e., they are better synchronized when
the temperature record is one day in advance to the precipitation record. In
comparison to synchronization of the two precipitation time series, they have
much less noise-induced synchronization in the background.
The fact that best synchronization for temperature records of Oxford and
Vienna is found when they are shifted by one day, exhibits the statistical
delay between cycles of weather at both sites. This conclusion is supported by
the result for precipitation series, where the maximum ρ occurs for shifting
of two days. Probably the real delay is approximately 1.5 days, which, due to
low sample-rate, can not be determined more precisely.

Usually Fourier Transform is applied in order to discover dominant global fre-
quencies or wavelengths in a considered time series. But no direct information
can be gained about cycles of varying wavelength, since Fourier Transform
detects global waves in the record. We suggest to use the cumulated phases
to estimate the wavelengths in the time series. Namely, we count the days,
until the phases pass steps of 2π, and generate a histogram with frequency of
occurrence versus wavelength.
For the temperature and precipitation records of Oxford these histograms are
shown in Fig. 6. In the case of temperature (Fig. 6(a)) the ﬂuctuations have
a wide range from 2 to about 90 days, but most of them take ﬁve to ten
days. The precipitation record (Fig. 6(b)) consists of much more ﬂuctuations
of short wavelength. The length of three days occurs 274 times, while only 84
times in the temperature record. Also the maximum wavelength of the precip-
itation record is only about 50 days. Note that the considered cycles are not
periodic, but have random wavelengths.

4 Discussion

Comparing phase synchronization with the classical cross-correlation method
is of interest. While in phase synchronization the phases of the cycles play
the major role and not the amplitudes, in cross-correlation both aspects are
superimposed. Thus we expect to obtain complementary information from the
two approaches. In the following two examples more signiﬁcant results were
obtained from phase synchronization compared to cross-correlation.
In Fig. 7 we compare time lag phase synchronization and time lag cross-
correlation for precipitation in two sites in Asia. The phase synchronization
index exhibits a distinct peak with a maximum at −3 days, while the cross-
correlation only gives large background noise with a peak that is almost
indistinguishable from the background. Fig. 8 also demonstrates an advan-
tage of phase synchronization. It compares phase synchronization and cross-
correlation for records without annual deseasoning. Here only the average
value of each record was subtracted. It is seen, that while in the phase syn-
chronization almost a constant background with ρ ≈ 0.19 is obtained, the
cross-correlation shows large annual oscillations, as expected. Thus, the peak
in phase synchronization (ρ = 0.25) compared to the background (Fig. 8(a)) is
much more signiﬁcant than that in cross-correlation analysis (Fig. 8(b)). The
high value of the constant background in the time lag phase synchronization is
due to the annual synchronization, which is almost not inﬂuenced by variation
of the time lag. The peak in the time lag phase synchronization (Fig. 8(a)) is
thus mainly due to phase synchronization of the ﬂuctuations which represents
irregular cycles of deviation from the mean annual cycle.
Synchronization in the atmosphere plays an important role in climatology.
For example tests on an atmospheric global circulation model have been done,
where the complete synchronization of the two hemispheres has been analyzed
[10]. What does phase synchronization in climate records mean? For tempera-
ture records, e.g. a complete relatively warm period followed by a cold period
represents a cycle in terms of phases. At another site, which is synchronized
to the ﬁrst, statistically a similar cycle also occurs, maybe with some delay.
The amplitudes of these cycles have no inﬂuence on the phase synchroniza-
tion. This is in contrast to cross-correlation, which is strongly aﬀected by the
amplitudes. Thus, phase synchronization might be useful when interaction in
records of diﬀerent climate regions is analyzed, such as maritime, where tem-
perature ﬂuctuations are less pronounced, and continental regions with larger
ﬂuctuations.

Economy correlations between the 19 richest countries are investigated through their
Gross Domestic Product increments. A distance is deﬁned between increment correlation
matrix elements and their evolution studied as a function of time and time window size.
Unidirectional and Bidirectional Minimal Length Paths are generated and analyzed for
diﬀerent time windows. A sort of critical correlation time window is found indicating a
transition for best observations. The mean length path decreases with time, indicating
stronger correlations. A new method for estimating a realistic minimal time window to
observe correlations and deduce macroeconomy conclusions from such features is thus
suggested.

Keywords: corrrelations, gross domestic product, globalization, econophysics, linear net-
work

1. Introduction

How the national economy changes and notably how it increases, i.e. macroeconomic
considerations have entered econophysics research.

One question which has been raised is whether there is a possibility to model
macroeconomic questions and features from statistical models or better in our opin-
ion from so-called microscopic models 1−5. There have been attempts a long time
ago and more recently about so called business cycles e.g. 6. There is no certain
way with so few data points to claim that the distribution of GDP increments, or
cumulative increments, called recession or prosperity periods, follow a power law or
an exponential distribution. This has been discussed elsewhere 7,8,9. A few papers
9,10 of interest pertain to scaling laws in the durations of recession and prosper-
ity, e.g. when measured through the GDP of a country. Indeed in most countries,
the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the oﬃcial measure of the economic output

because it is the best basis for evaluating the well being of the citizens of a given
country 11.

GDP is usually deﬁned as the total market value of all ﬁnal goods and services
produced in a country in a given year, equal to total consumption, investment and
government spending, plus the value of exports, minus the value of imports 12. GDP
diﬀers from the Gross National Product (GNP): For example, in the USA GNP
includes the value of goods produced by USA citizens abroad, in China, Argentina
or Brazil.

There are formidable problems involved in constructing GDP data series, many
of which are discussed in 13. It is important for readers with a natural science back-
ground to appreciate that, outside ﬁnancial markets, almost all economic data is
estimated and the margin of error around any individual data point can be substan-
tial. This is the case even with modern estimates of GDP data for the most recent
years. The business activity might, as it is known, be measured through qualitative
factors, including the concept of economic sentiment indicator, and others some-
times more quantitative; see the interesting studies by 14. Moreover the time scales
are not very clear, e.g it is known that it takes a long time before some policy change
is implemented, has some eﬀect which can be later analyzed and corrected if nec-
essary. Parameters are known to be hardly precise, and the variations of variables
are not quantitatively well known. Such macroeconomic studies are thus a challenge
to econophysicists because the set of data points is usually small, and not much is
really proven, - according to usual physicist insight.

Among (other) classical points raised in macroeconomy and media is the so
called globalization of the economy. In the review 15 by O’Rourke and Williamson
16 one ﬁnds some coverage of GDP statistics per capita and GDP per worker hour,
but the authors consider these macroeconomic aggregates inadequate because they
are generally unreliable and the more so frequently not even available. The main
criticisms are perhaps that the most important defect resides in the averaging of all
incomes, whence bypassing much valuable data needed to understand the factors
aﬀecting migration patterns, political responses to globalization, and the sources of
convergence of economics.

Even though this GDP analysis is considered to be full of defects, it is sometimes
used in order to prove the defects of globalization: see AFL-CIO statement 17
: Globalization ... has produced a race to the bottom in which companies search
the globe for the lowest possible labor costs and weakest environmental safeguards.
Today’s global economy has greatly increased the income gap worldwide, making the
rich even wealthier and eroding working families’ standard of living.

Others, like 18, would claim that globalization ... is less impressive than most
non-economists think, judged either by the standard of 100 years ago or by the
hypothetical standard of perfect international integration. Let us point out that he
also considers implications for economic growth not measured by GDP. Therefore,
it seems unclear whether economy globalization is proven: it is neither described
along statistical lines nor accounted for by microscopic models.

Thus in order to contribute to these questions, we have performed correlations
studies of GDP, or more precisely annual GDP increments, for the latest 54 years
(1950-2003) as if every country economy can be described by the time series y(t) of
its annual GDP. The reason why increments are considered should be stressed at
ﬁrst. While summation series, like Σy(t) illustrate the long term development, the
annual increment series emphasizes the ﬂuctuations, i.e. volatility and variability.
In some sense the former is a so called mean ﬁeld like approximation approach, sort
of moving average, degrading the role of ﬂuctuations, while the latter emphasizes
the possible critical aspects, in a thermodynamics sense; whence our choice of the
signal to be analysed.

We are not at this time interested in regional or interregional disparities, but
rather care about the leading actors, i.e. the 19 richest countries. They are in (En-
glish) alphabetical order: Austria (AUT), Belgium (BEL), Canada (CAN), Denmark
(DNK), Finland (FIN), France (FRA), Germanya (DEU), Greece (GRC), Ireland
(IRL), Italy (ITA), Japan (JPN), the Netherlands (NLD), Norway (NOR), Portugal
(PRT), Spain (SPE), Sweden (SWE), Switzerland (CHE), United Kingdom (GBR)
and USA. Conventional (three letter) notations are used for labelling the countries
following the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development 19. The
GDP yearly increments are next considered and their statistics are reported in Sect.
3.

It is of interest to see whether they are connected and if in some way how.
We will discuss whether they form clusters, and if these are stable or not. Recall
that there are diﬀerent ways to ﬁnd clusters in communities, i.e. through Random
Walk (20), Laplacian (21), Adjacent... matrix eigenvalue and eigenvector displays.
Here we consider a more simple quite pedestrian approach based on 1-dimensional
geometric display, emphasizing the strongest connections only. In order to do so,
a ”distance matrix” is constructed. The unidirectional (with a given initial point)
and bidirectional minimal length paths (UMLP and BMLP respectively) are next
constructed, as a function of time and for moving time windows, having various
(but constant during the displacement) sizes.

The ”local correlations” between these GDP increments are then investigated
as follows. The evolution of the mean distance between countries are reported as a
function of time for 5y, 15y, 25y and 35y time windows. It is found that diﬀerent time
windows emphasize diﬀerent features, in particular the ”strength of correlations”.
A sort of critical correlation time (window) is found indicating a transition for
observations and correlation strengths. A new method for estimating a realistic
minimal time window to observe meaningful correlations in such macroeconomy
features and questions is thus suggested. In so doing, clustering eﬀects from the
point of view of correlations between the GDP of the 19 most developed countries
and globalization of these economies are observed.

aGermany is considered as a single country. To have a whole record the data are constructed as
the sum of GDP of both German countries before consolidation.

It is thereby obtained that an economic conclusion can be derived through such
a statistical physics approach: an increase in correlations, seen through a reduction
of the UMLP and BMLP overall length for the GDP annual increments of such rich
countries, is now a proven feature.

2. Data source
The GDP of the 19 richest countries are taken from the web 22. The GDP values
for each of these countries are ﬁrst normalised to their 1990 value given in US
dollars as published by the Groningen Growth and Development Center on their
web page 23. The data covers the period between 1950 and 2003, i.e. 54 points for
each country. An additional ”All” entity has been added for comparison. Its GDP
value is constructed as the sum of 19 country GDP. This All ”artiﬁcial country”
can serve as some base (more precisely ”top”) line for globalization idea reference.
In fact it is also possible to introduce a normalised increment as a increment with
respect to that of ”All”, but for the sake of simplicity we do not exploit this idea.

(1)

3. Data analysis

The yearly GDP increments to be studied are deﬁnned as
GDP (t) − GDP (t − 1)
GDP (t − 1)

∆GDP (t) =

calculated at the end of a year t ∈ (1951; 2003).

We have tested the normality of the GDP increment through the Jarque-Bera

(JB) test 26. First the JB coeﬃcient is deﬁned as

JB =

(S2 +

T
6

(K − 3)2
4

),

where T denotes the number of data points. Notice that the Jarque-Bera test for
normality takes into account two distribution parameters: skewness (S) and kurtosis
(K). Then the value of JB is compared with the χ2 statistics with 2 degrees of
freedom. The value of 5% conﬁdence level from a χ2 statistics with 2 degrees of
freedom is 5.99. It is found that only Switzerland does not satisfy such a normality
test, i.e. JBCHE = 6.57. In the case of Germany, All and Ireland the GDP increment
statistics is highly Gaussian (JBDEU = 0.269, JBAll = 0.501, JBIRL = 0.715).
The second set of countries with highly Gaussian statistics of GDP increments
(JR ∈ (1, 1.2)) are: USA, FRA, ITA, NLD, BEL, SWE, GRC.

3.1. Distance matrices
The distance between countries is deﬁned following 27

d(i, j)(t,T ) = q2(1 − Γ(t,T )(ci, cj))

where the correlation function is deﬁned as

Γ(t,T )(ci, cj) =

< cicj >(t,T ) − < ci >(t,T )< cj >(t,T )
(t,T ))(< c2

i >(t,T ) − < ci >2

j >(t,T ) − < cj >2

(t,T ))

,

(4)

q(< c2

where ci denotes the time series of increments of GDP for the ith country, and
< ci >(t,T ) is the average of yearly GDP increments in the time window (t, t + T )
of size T .

An example of such a correlation matrix is reported for illustration purpose in

the case of the shortest (5y) time window ending in 2003 in Table 1.

Other possibilities to deﬁne a distance between time series are found in the litera-
ture 27,28,29 but are not considered here, because such deﬁnitions sometimes loose the
information about the diﬀerence between correlated and anticorrelated time series.

3.2. MLP algorithms

In order to obtain some quantitative information on the country correlations we have looked
for clustering possibilities. There are several classical ways to display clusters through
graph ordering or network construction techniques, like through the so called Minimum
Spanning Tree, which has indeed found many illustrations in stock markets analysis 30 and
GDP correlation studies31. However the MST is far from univocal. Moreover the present
MST would be of very limited size. If the MST has a homogeneous node distribution, its
4.47 if
”diameter” should be of the order of ln N , i.e.
it is a causal tree 32. In any case, the present trees will have very few branches, and at most
four levels. Not much structure would show up. Whence we discarded constructing a MST
in our investigations and opted for an apparently more pedestrian one dimensional (1-D)
approach. The following minimal length path algorithms (MLP) emphasize the strongest
correlation between entities through the constraint that the item is attached only once
to the network. This results in a lack of loops in the ”tree”. The construction of more
elaborate networks is left for further studies.

3, while it should be of order √N

≃

≃

Two diﬀerent minimal length path (MLP) algorithms have been developed and ana-

lyzed, i.e. the so called unidirectional (UMLP) and bidirectional (BMLP) paths.

UMLP The algorithm begins with choosing an initial point as a seed. Here the initial
point is the ”All” country. Next the shortest connection (in terms of the distance
deﬁnition, Eq.(3) is looked for between the seed and the other possible neighbors.
The closest possible one is selected and attached to the seed. One searches next
in the matrix for the entity closest to the previously attached one, and repeat the
process.

BMLP The algorithm begins with searching for the pair of countries which has the short-
est distance between them. Then these countries become the root of a chain. In
the next step the closest country for either ends of the chain is searched. The
shortest distance being found, the country is attached to the appropriate end.
Next a search is made for the closest neighbor of the new ends of the chain. Being
selected, the entity is attached, a.s.o. Notice that there is some arbitrariness in
the choice of the country position in the initial bond. We have chosen the ”alpha-
betical” order from left to right or bottom to up, for all displayed graphs, i.e. the
same order as on the example of distance matrix (Table 1).

In view of the UMLP and BMLP deﬁnitions, it is obvious that UMLP expands only

in one direction while BMLP may also grow in opposite ones.

An attempt to observe economy globalization...

7

The UMLP and BMLP chains have been constructed for all possible time windows.
For illustration purpose both cases are displayed, each year, for the 5y time window (Figs
1). Recall that the last t value corresponds to Dec. 31, 2003. Notice that the ﬁrst data
point on the time axis in each ﬁgure depends on the time window considered. The UMLP
and BMLP lengths vary with time for a given time window. E.g. for the 5y time window
the UMLP and BMLP extends up to 16 or so, but has a minimum near 7.5.

The total length of a chain can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of corre-
lations between countries: the more compact is a chain, the greater are the correlations.
Therefore the chain properties can be used as a quantitative measure of a globalization
process. It can be also searched whether the correlations are changing signiﬁcantly with
time.

4. Minimal length path analysis: time window observed eﬀects

The position of a country in the MLP chain represents the relative distance between
countries with respect to the measure, Eq. 3. So both UMLP and BMLP chain algorithms
rank the correlations between countries with respect to the relative distance.

The mean of each chain has been calculated in every possible year for every possible

time window (Figs. 2- 3).

4.1. 5 years time window

Considering the position of a country in a BMLP or UMLP chains (Figs. 1 (a-b)) it can
be found that within the 5y time window the position of countries is rapidly changing for
both BMLP and UMLP algorithms. Therefore it is diﬃcult to distinguish any speciﬁc or
regular behavior in such a time window. Generally the distances are decreasing (from 1.0
to 0.6) obtaining the lowest values at the end of the considered time interval (1995 - 2003)
with the exception for the interval 1998 - 2000.

4.2. 15 years time window

In the case of the short time scale, i.e. 15 y, the mean distance and the total length of
the chains do not change signiﬁcantly as the time window is moved along the time axis.
In comparison to the 5y time window it can be said that the distribution of distances is
stabilising. From the statistical mean value point of view, three regions can be distinguished
for both path construction procedures. In the case of UMLP, Fig. 2.b, for 1965 - 1982, the
mean distance is decreasing, starting from the value
0.8 at its local
minimum. Later on the mean distance is increasing till 1990 before a decreasing tendency
till 2003. The BMLP chain follows the same pattern (Fig 3.b).

It is worth noticing that within this time window a globalization process can be already
observed. The chains shorten, because the correlations between countries become stronger,
especially in the recent years.

This conclusion is also supported by a detailed analysis of each country position in
the UMLP and BMLP chains. In the case of the UMLP chain the country closely related
to the average is USA, which is the second country in the chain (just after ”All” in 32
out of 39 considered time windows (1965 - 1979, 1987 - 2001 and 2003). The second
country is Germany, which ﬁve times takes the second country in the chain (1982 - 1986).
Along this UMLP procedure the strongest correlations are found between USA - All and
USA - All - DEU, whence displaying the leading role of USA and Germany for the world
economy. Besides this set two more pairs can be pointed out: SPE - PRT (1993 - 2003),
and strangely JPN - GRC (1976 - 1988)again. USA, CAN and GBR remain at very stable

positions throughout the whole considered period. In other periods DEU (1975 - 1979,
1981 - 1984, 1995 - 2001), SWE (1965 - 1975, 1991 - 2001) and BEL (1990 - 1993, 1994 -
2002) do not change much their position in the BMLP chain.

In the case of BMLP, similar patterns are revealed and strong correlation between All
- USA and USA - All - DEU. JPN - GRC and SPE - PRT is observed. This analysis shows
also an important role of NLD, which is situated very close to the initial pair of the chain
(1975 - 1990). The countries with stable positions in the chains are CAN (1965 - 1969,
1976 - 1979, 1987 - 1997), FRA (1965 - 1969, 1975 - 1979 and 1987 - 1997).

4.3. 25 years time window

As compared with the previously considered cases Sect. 4.1 and Sect. 4.2 it can be noticed
that the correlations between countries are stabilising over the medium (25y) time scale.
In the mean distance evolution (Figs. 2 and 3) four regions can be distinguished. The mean
distance between countries is decreasing in years (1975 - 1988 and 1990 - 1993), (1975 -
1985 and 1990 - 1993) in the case of BMLP and UMLP respectively. The minimum value
are 0.86 (1995), 0.86 (1993) and 0.84 (1988) and 0.81 (1993) for BMLP and UMLP chains.
As it was observed for the 15y time window, the most inﬂuent countries are USA,
DEU, CAN. However new countries can be added to this set. In BMLP analysis a cluster
(the set of most highly correlated countries) formation can be noticed. Specially strong
and stable correlations can be seen between USA - All - GBR - CAN in (1975 - 1982),
FRA - NLD - DEU - GBR - CAN (1985 - 1992) and ITA - DEU - All - USA - CAN -
GBR (1995 - 2003). The second set of cluster is formed by countries, which are not placed
at the beginning of the chain, but also reveal strong and stable correlations: NLD - PRT
- SPE, JPN - GRC - ITA and ITA - FRA.

In the case of UMLP the clustering process is not so well seen, especially in the ini-
tial part of the chain, since the initial point has been arbitrarily chosen. Therefore only
strongest correlations can be seen e.g. JPN - GRC - ITA. However UMLP shows relative
position of a country and it can be seen that in many cases the position is very stable e.g.
USA, CAN - almost all considered interval, DEU (1986 - 1990), GBR (1976 - 1980, 1994
- 2001), FRA (1975 - 1990), IRL (1975 - 1998), NOR (1975 - 1995).

4.4. 35 years time window

In the long (35 y) time scale the mean distance between countries, and the total length of
the chain, is decreasing through almost all considered time intervals (1985 - 1997 and 2000
- 2003): the minimum being 0.82 (1997) and 0.85 (1996) for BMLP and UMLP respectively.
This indicates that for the 25y time window analysis, the globalisation process is observed.
Several clusters are also seen in this long time window (with some small modiﬁcations):
BEL - JPN - FRA - NLD - All - USA - CAN (1985 - 1991), GBR - USA - All - JPN -
FRA - BEL - NLD - DEU (1992 - 1994), SPE - FRA - BEL - NLD - DEU - All - USA
(1995 - 2001), GBR - USA - All - DEU - FRA - BEL (2002 - 2003). Besides those, strong
correlations can be seen between JPN - ITA - GRC - AUT (1998 - 2001), JPN - GRC
(1085 -1990, 1995 - 1997). In the case of UMLP not only the special role of USA can be
seen but also CAN, BEL, FRA, NLD and DEU, which are very close to the initial point
of BMLP chains in almost all considered cases. The surprisingly distinct position of DEU
(close to the end of chains) in the interval (1985 - 1992) can be likely explained by the
fact, that Germany (DEU) until Berlin wall fall was two separated countries, but as it
was mentioned in Sect. 1 it is treated here as a single previously lasting entity. It is likely
though that the deﬁnition of GDP might have been diﬀeent in East and West Germany
before the Berlin wall overthrow.

4.5. 45 years time window

In the case of very long (45y) time windows there is no point to perform a detailed statis-
tical analysis, since there are only a few data points available. However it is worth notic-
ing that both path analyses point out to an undergoing globalization process: the mean
distance is decreasing throughout all considered moving time windows. The relationship
between countries remains similar as in the previous time window sizes; the leading coun-
tries are USA and CAN. An interesting case is presented by BEL and NLD, which are
rather small countries, but their positions in the ranking is very close to the initial point
of a chain.

This is likely due to the fact, that the economies of those countries are closely related
to the neighboring and leading countries, i.e. much depend on the economic evolution
elsewhere.

5. Time scale analysis

The statistical properties of the averaged distances between countries for the diﬀerent time
windows located at a given time have been next analysed. The average distance and average
standard deviation for BMLP and UMLP are presented in Fig. 4. The average distance
has a downward trend with the increasing size of the time window, though 7y oscillations
seem to be revealed in the UMLP case. The standard deviation is decreasing (Fig. 4) with
the size of the time window for both algorithms. Three regions can be distinguished. A
special role for the 25y time window has been observed, at which the mean value reaches
a relatively stable value and for which the standard deviation has a plateau.

6. Conclusion

The economy evolution of the top 19 richest countries has been investigated through their
Gross Domestic Product increments correlations. The distance (between increment corre-
lation) matrix has been calculated as a function of time. The Unidirectional and Bidirec-
tional Minimal Length Paths (UMLP and BMLP) have been generated and analysed for
diﬀerent time windows. The total chain length decreases as a function of time. The choice
of a relevant time window is emphasized for getting less noisy results. A sort of critical
correlation time window has been found. Comparing the special role of 25y time window
seen from the distances analysis for changing length of time window with the fact that the
correlations between countries are well seen in the 25y time window (Sect. 4.3) it seems
that in the case of investigation of correlation on the world level the 25y time window is
the most appropriate one. Indeed the analysis of UMLP and BMLP graphs shows that the
shortest time window, which allows to observe correlations between countries should not
be shorter than 15y and the most appropriate is of the length of 25y. Otherwise only the
strongest correlations can be observed. Thus such an observation window also indicates
a transition for observations, related to weak and strong ﬂuctuation correlations, as at
a physical phase transition. A new method for estimating a realistic minimal time win-
dow to observe correlations in such macroeconomy, but also stock market features is thus
suggested.

Because the GDP increment distance between countries is overall decreasing, this
suggests similarities in development patterns, which likely result from interactions of
economies, in a globalization sense. Two at ﬁrst bizarre cases can serve as an argument and
should be pointed out. One is the case of Belgium, with a very entangled economy according
to standard political considerations. Another is the surprising connection Greece-Japan.
Yet, it is known that half the Japanese ﬂeet is greek owned 33.

Notice that when the properties of UMLP and BMLP algorithms are compared, it can
be pointed out, that BMLP is more sensitive to searching for a clustering patterns among
the considered entities, while UMLP is more suitable for ranking countries. In so doing it
could be useful in solving portfolio problem optimizations.

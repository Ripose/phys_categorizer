Abstract

We solve the dynamic equation for the kinetic spherical model that
initially is in an arbitrary equilibrium state and then is left to evolve
in a heat-bath with another temperature. Flows of the Renormaliza-
tional group are determined.

1. Introduction

In recent years, the universal scaling in non-equilibrium states have attracted
much attention[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The phase-ordering process (POP) [6] and the
short-time critical dyanmics (SCD) [7] are two fruitful examples. In the POP,
the system initially at a very high temperature then is quenched to a heat-
bath of very low temperature. In the SCD, the heat-bath has the critical
temperature of the system.

In both POP and SCD, the initial correlation length is assumed to be
zero. For ﬁnite initial correlation, the scaling invariance of the initial state
is broken. One would expect a crossover phenomenon that is usually quite
diﬃcult to study either by theoretic methods or by numerical simulation.
In order to gain an insight into this phenomenon, in the present paper we
investigate the kinetic spherical model (KSM) with initial correlation.

The short-time dynamics of the kinetic spherical model with zero initial
correlation length has been studied in [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. In the
latest publication [9] the eﬀect of non-zero initial order was emphasized.

The system to be considered in the present paper is initially at an arbi-
trary equilibrium state. Then it is suddenly put into a heat-bath of another
temperature. The external ﬁeld is also removed instantly. The system is
assumed to evolve following the Langevin equation. We are interested in
the non-equilibrium transient state in the following time. We will concen-
trate on the time-dependent order parameter m(t). To include the non-zero
correlation, one must integrate the non-trivial properties of the initial equi-
librium state. Though most properties of the spherical model can be found
in literatures, e.g., the famous book by Baxter [17], it is still quite tricky to
connect the equilibrium initial state with the non-equilibrium dynamics. We
ﬁnd that besides the subtraction of mass that is known in the zero initial
correlation, one need an extra renormalization of the dynamic equation.

The correlation length is inversely proportional to the square root of z0 that

It deﬁnes the critical temperature βcJ = w(0) [17]. Substituting it into (12)
at the critical temperature, one can ﬁnd τsub = 1 for the Ito prescription
with which the last term of (12) is zero due to causality. If the Stratonovich
prescription is used, the last term of (12) is 1 and τsub = 0. Through the
paper, Ito prescription will be used.

where the constant D = ( 9

temporal microscopic detail is lost. However, this microscopic detail would
have macroscopic eﬀects through equation (19) since it associates with the
factor

which in Laplace reversion is a factor increasing versus time exponentially.
Therefore, a renormalization multiplier Λ is needed to rescue the error intro-
duced by equation (19).

5. Discussions and Conclusions

In summary, we have studied the transient behavior of KSM that is quenched
from an arbitrary temperature into another. The formula can describe or-
dering/disordering phenomena and the critical dynamics. We ﬁnd that the
correct long-time behavior can be only recovered after the subtraction of
mass as well as the renormalization of the dynamic equation.

From the exact magnetization obtained in the present paper, one can
ﬁnd out the ﬂows of renormalizational group of the bare parameters β, z0
and m0(or β0) under the scale transformation. Changing the time scale by a
factor bz, in order to keep the macroscopic quantity m(t) unchange up to a
scaling factor, th and tβ must be transformed in the same way,

th(b) = bzth(1), tβ(b) = bztβ(1)

while A must be an invariant,

A(b) = A(1)

(31)

(32)

(33)

(34)

The relations of bare parameters and the scaling factor b are implicitly deﬁned
in the above equations. These are the so-called characteristic functions for
the dynamic crossover phenomena [8, 9, 18, 19].

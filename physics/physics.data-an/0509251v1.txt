Abstract

Statistical moments of the intensity distributions are used as molecular descriptors. They are

used as a basis for deﬁning similarity distances between two model spectra. Parameters which

carry the information derived from the comparison of shapes of the spectra and are related to the

number of properties taken into account, are deﬁned.

INTRODUCTION

The basic values in statistical theory of spectra are moments of the intensity distribution

I(E). In the case of discrete spectra the n−th statistical moment is deﬁned as:

i=1
P
where Ii is the intensity of the i−th line and Ei is the corresponding energy diﬀerence. If the

spectral lines are suﬃciently close to each other then the spectrum may be approximated by

a continuous function. Then the n−th moment of the intensity distribution is deﬁned as:

where C(E) is the range of the energy for which the integrand does not vanish.

convenient to consider normalized spectra I(E) = NI(E), where N =

I(E)dE

,

for which the area below the distribution function is equal to 1. Then

Convenient characteristics of the distributions may be derived from the properly scaled
distribution moments. Moments normalized to the mean value equal to zero (M ′

1 = 0) are

referred to as the centered moments. The n − th centered moment reads:

According to the so called principle of moments [1, 2, 3] we expect that if we identify the

lower moments of two distributions, we bring these distributions to approximate identity.

In this paper we apply this principle to the theory of molecular similarity. We assume

that molecules have similar properties if their intensity distributions and, consequently the

corresponding moments, are approximately the same.

We propose that statistical moments of the intensity distributions can be treated as a

new kind of molecular descriptors. A very clear meaning has the ﬁrst moment, M1, which

describes the mean value of the distribution.

In a similar sense a colour index has been

introduced in astronomy [4] - its value allows us to compare spectra of diﬀerent stars (it

carries an information about molecules forming the star). The second centered moment,
M ′
which describes the asymmetry of the spectrum. The kurtosis coeﬃcient M ′′

2, is the variance which gives the width of the distribution. M ′′

3 is the skewness coeﬃcient

4 is connected

to the excess of the distribution.

II. THEORY AND THE MODEL SPECTRA

According to the method of moments, the shapes of two distributions are more similar

if the number of identical moments is larger. Similarity of distributions in two- and three-

moment approximations, in the context of the construction of envelopes of electronic bands,
has been analyzed in Refs. [5, 6, 7, 8]. Analogously, we deﬁne similarity parameters Si1i2...ik

k

(k is the number of properties taken into account in the process of comparison) as a nor-

malized information derived from a comparison of two distributions, referred to as α and

β:

Here n is the total number of properties taken into account in the comparison of the two

spectra and ik = 1, 2, . . . n (k = 1, 2, . . . n), correspond to a speciﬁc property. In particular,

as the property number one (ik = 1) we take the ﬁrst moment, as the property number

two (ik = 2) we take the second centered moment, number three (ik = 3) - the asymmetry

coeﬃcient, number four (ik = 4) - the kurtosis coeﬃcient. In this paper we take n = 4 and

the corresponding similarity distances are deﬁned as follows:

The values of all the descriptors may vary from 0 (identical properties) to 1.

We also deﬁne an additional parameter which may be evaluated if both spectra we are

going to compare are available:

D =

1
2 ZC′(E)

|I ′α(E) − I ′β(E)|dE.

(20)

This parameter is given by the integral of the module of the diﬀerence between the compared
distributions and is not related to the moments. In the deﬁnition of D, I ′ denotes the dis-

tributions transformed so that their averages are the same. If we compare two distributions

of the same shape then D = 0. If two distributions do not overlap at all, then D = 1. It

is important to note that the distribution moments are deﬁned as numbers attached to a

given spectrum and the similarity distances Dn are easily derived from the knowledge of

these numbers. The parameter D, though it gives accurate information about similarity of

two spectra, is rather cumbersome since it may be derived only if the complete spectra are

given.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In order to illustrate our approach, we took model spectra consisting of two bands, i.e.

having two maxima (max = 2):

where γ = {c1, a1, ǫ1, c2, a2, ǫ2}. In order to see relations between molecular spectra, deﬁned

in Eq. (26) and the similarity indices deﬁned in Eqs. (16) - (20) and (22) - (25) in a simple

and transparent way, we study three sequences of spectra, where in each sequence only one

parameter has been modiﬁed: c2 in sequence I, a2 in sequence II, ǫ2 in sequence III.

(a) Sequence I corresponds to the situation when a symmetric spectrum consisting of two

identical Gaussian distributions shifted relative to each other by ǫ2 −ǫ1 = 1 (a1 = a2 =

1.0, ǫ1 = 1.2, ǫ2 = 2.2, c1 = c2 = 5.0) transforms to a distribution in which the width

of one of the Gaussians changes due to the change of the parameter c2 = 5.0 + δc,

where δc ∈ h0; 19.8i. Then, we compare shapes of intensity distributions I α(E) and

I β(E), where α = {5.0, 1.0, 1.2, 5.0, 1.0, 2.2}, β = {5.0, 1.0, 1.2, 5.0 + δc, 1.0, 2.2}.

In Fig. 1 spectra corresponding to δc = 0 (solid lines) and δc > 0 (dashed lines) are

compared. In each case values of δc and S4 are given. A correlation between these two

numbers and between shapes of the spectra is clearly seen. The value of S4 increases

when the two spectra become less similar.

(b) Sequence II corresponds to the same symmetric spectrum as before (a1 = a2 = 1.0,

ǫ1 = 1.2, ǫ2 = 2.2, c1 = c2 = 5.0) transforming to the distributions in which the

height of one of the Gaussians changes due to the changes of a2 = 1.0 + δa, where
δa ∈ h0; 9.9i. Then, we compare shapes of intensity distributions I α(E) and I β(E),

where α = {5.0, 1.0, 1.2, 5.0, 1.0, 2.2}, β = {5.0, 1.0, 1.2, 5.0, 1.0 + δa, 2.2}.

In Fig. 2 spectra corresponding to δa = 0 (solid lines) and δa > 0 (dashed lines) are

compared. In each case values of δa and S4 are given. The conclusions are similar to

(c) Sequence III corresponds to a similar situation as before, except that the maxima in

I α are shifted by 1.5 rather than by 1 (a1 = a2 = 1.0, ǫ1 = 1.2, ǫ2 = 2.7, c1 = c2 =
5.0). I α transforms to the distribution I β for which one of the gaussian distribution

changes the location of the second maximum ǫ2 = 2.7 − δǫ, where δǫ ∈ h0; 0.99i.
Then, we compare shapes of intensity distributions I α(E) and I β(E), where α =

{5.0, 1.0, 1.2, 5.0, 1.0, 2.7}, β = {5.0, 1.0, 1.2, 5.0, 1.0, 2.7 − δǫ}.

In Fig. 3 spectra corresponding to δǫ = 0 (solid lines) and δǫ > 0 (dashed lines) are

compared. In each case values of δǫ and S4 are given. The conclusions are similar to

those in the cases described by Figs. 1 and 2.

The molecular descriptors [statistical moments of I β(E)] are plotted in Fig. 4 versus δc

(sequence I), δa (sequence II), δǫ (sequence III). In case of sequence I, it is clear that the

considered change of the spectrum leads to a decrease of the ﬁrst moment (the intensity is

is shifted towards smaller energies. In consequence the ﬁrst moment decreases. The whole
distribution becomes more narrow and, consequently, we observe decreasing of M ′

Fig. 5 presents D deﬁned in Eqs.

(16) - (20).

In the case of sequence I, if δc = 0,

we compare two identical distributions and all the descriptors are equal to zero. The most

sensitive to the changes of δc is in this case D, contrary to the other descriptors which are

nearly constant. The two distributions are rather similar in sense of the average value, of

the width, of the asymmetry and of the kurtosis (the values of D1, D2, D3, D4 are small and

the corresponding curves cross). In case of sequence II, we observe small values of D2 and

D1, that indicates large similarity of the two distributions in sense of the width and of the

average values. For small values of δa we observe crossings between D3, D4 and D. The

most sensitive to the changes of δa is D4. In case of sequnce III, the behaviour of D1 and D2
is very similar. Both spectra are totally symmetric (M ′′α

′′β
3 = 0). Therefore D3 = 0

3 = M

for all δǫ. D4 and D cross and change very substantially contrary to D1 and D2 which are

nearly constant.

Fig. 6 presents similarity parameters Sk for k = 1, 2, 3, 4 [Eqs. (22) - (25)]. Small values

of S correspond to high similarity of the model spectra. In particular, if δc = 0 (sequence

I) then Sk = 0 for all k. As we can see, S is the smallest for k = 1 and increases with

increasing k. Analogously to the sequence I, S1 < S2 < S3 < S4 for all δa (sequence II) and

for all δǫ (sequence III). Intuitively, we expect that two systems which are similar to each

other when only one property is considered may exhibit more diﬀerences if we look at the

systems in more detail, taking into account more properties. These features can be seen in

Fig. 6.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Statistical moments describe in an adequate way the degree of similarity of two-band

model spectra. Though the mathematical model describing shapes of the spectra is rela-

tively simple, it reﬂects the behaviour of real molecular spectra. Three parameters: c, a and

ǫ, inﬂuence diﬀerent aspects of the shapes of spectra and the resulting values of D. In par-

ticular, parameters D and corresponding S are the smallest if a and ǫ are constant (sequence

I). In these cases spectra are only slightly modiﬁed by δc (Fig. 1). Larger diﬀerences of

spectra are caused by parameter δa , while c and ǫ are constant (sequence II). The inﬂuence

of ǫ on spectra is also large (sequence III). The additional parameter D introduces some

independent information about spectra. Contrary to the case of single-band model spectra

studied in our previous paper [9], where its behaviour is very similar to D4, here it apeears

to be the most sensitive index (sequence I).

Summarizing, we demonstrated that spectral density distribution moments can be used

for deﬁning similarity indices of spectra. By grouping molecules according to the spectral

density distribution moments we can get a chance to discover new characteristics in the

ﬁeld of molecular similarity and in particular it may be a tool for studies in the area of

computational toxicology [10, 11, 12].

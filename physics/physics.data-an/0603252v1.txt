Traﬃc ﬂows are studied in terms of their noise of sound, which is an easily accessible experimental
quantity. The sound noise data is studied making use of scaling properties of wavelet transforms
and Hurst exponents are extracted. The scaling behavior is used to characterize the traﬃc ﬂows in
terms of scaling properties of the memory function in Mori-Lee stochastic diﬀerential equations. The
results obtained provides for a new theoretical as well as experimental framework to characterize
the large-time behavior of traﬃc ﬂows. The present paper outlines the procedure by making use
of one-lane computer simulations as well as sound-data measurements from a real two-lane traﬃc
ﬂow. We ﬁnd the presence of conventional diﬀusion as well as 1/f noise in real traﬃc ﬂows at large
time scales.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Various aspects on traﬃc ﬂows has been studied in
great detail over the years (see e.g. Refs.[1, 2] and ref-
erences cited therein). Due to the properties of vehicles
and the variability of drivers behavior, it appears quite
natural that stochastic methods is the proper theoreti-
cal framework in modelling of traﬃc ﬂows. Numerical
simulations based on the Nagel-Schreckenberg scenario
[3, 4] have provided us with various insights in the large
scale behavior of traﬃc ﬂows and various actual analyt-
ical modelling has been discussed in great detail the lit-
erature (for some recent accounts see e.g. Refs.[5]).

It has become an increasing demand in populated ar-
eas to monitor and control the sound noise level of traﬃc
ﬂows. It is an easy experimental task to collect sound
data of a traﬃc ﬂow, but it is our understanding that
such data has not until now been used to study the prop-
erties of the traﬃc ﬂow by itself. In the present paper we
introduce what we believe is a new and novel experimen-
tal method to study some characteristic features of traﬃc
ﬂows which can be combined with the theory of stochas-
tic diﬀerential equations of the Mori-Lee type [6, 7] with
memory eﬀects included.
In the course of our discus-
sion below we will see that this actually can be a fruitful
method. By making use of a now well established scal-
ing analysis in terms of wavelets, one can infer self-aﬃne
properties of traﬃc ﬂows. Generic properties of Mori-
Lee [6, 7] stochastic diﬀerential equations are then in fact
compatible with the scaling properties obtained from the
data analysis. We use artiﬁcial traﬃc data as obtained
from one-lane computer simulations with car stopping in-
cluded as well as data from a real ﬁeld measurement of
an opposite two-lane traﬃc ﬂow with a common cross-

road in order to test our procedure. The real traﬃc data
exhibits short-time scaling corresponding to normal Ein-
stein diﬀusion, a ﬁnite time 1/f noise (see e.g. Ref.[8] and
references therein) behavior as well as large-time ﬂuctu-
ations of the sound-level corresponding to a ﬂat power
spectrum.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section II we re-
call some basic properties of stochastic diﬀerential equa-
tions of the Mori-Lee form in terms of conventional
Laplace transform techniques. The large-time properties
of ﬂuctuations in the noise level are expressed in terms
of the short distance properties of the Laplace transform
of the memory function. In Section III we analyze time-
series of sound measurements of traﬃc ﬂows. The scaling
properties of the traﬃc data is based on a now estab-
lished method of wavelet scaling properties of statistical
data and the extraction of the so called Hurst scaling
exponent [9, 10, 11].
In Section IV we summarize our
results and suggest further extensions of our analysis of
traﬃc ﬂows.

II. MEMORY EFFECTS AND THE MORI-LEE
EQUATION

We consider the dynamics of the traﬃc system in terms
of the sound noise they produce. This noise will be mod-
elled by a second-order stochastic diﬀerential equation
for the time-dependent sound intensity I(t) treated as
a stochastic variable with a space-homogeneous memory
function of the form [12]

t′)v(t′) = F (t) .

(1)

Here v(t) = dI(t)/dt/I(t), and F (t) is a stochastic back-
ground. Eq.(1) can be derived from the wave-equation
for space-homogeneous sound propagation assuming a
stochastic source of the form F (t)I(t) and including a

general causal form of Mori-Lee dissipation as well as
linearizing in time-derivatives. The time integral of v(t)
will then be the sound-level L(t) = log(I(t)/I0) with a
suitable reference level I0 expressed in decibel, which is
an easily measurable quantity for traﬃc ﬂows. With-
out lack of generality the memory function Γ(t) and the
stochastic background F (t) can be assumed to be sym-
metric under time-reversal since v(
v(t). The
ﬂuctuations of F (t) are supposed to be stationary with a
correlation compatible with the generalized ﬂuctuation-
dissipation theorem [13], i.e.

III. WAVELET ANALYSIS OF TRAFFIC FLOW
DATA

The new experimental method we suggest is to make
use of the noise of sound as produced by traﬃc ﬂows. The
large-time behavior of the sound data obtained from such
traﬃc ﬂows can be characterized in terms of the scaling
properties of suitably averaged wavelet amplitudes of an
input signal S(t), i.e.

W [S] (λa) = λH W [S] (a) ,

(11)

where H is the Hurst exponent and W [S] stands for the
wavelet transform of the signal S(t) given in form of a
time-series. Our normalization is such that H = 0.5 cor-
responds to conventional Brownian motion. The averag-
ing procedure we make use of follows the suggestion of
Ref.[11], i.e. at a given scale a we average over the abso-
lute values of the signal S(t) in the wavelet domain and
a. ∆L(t)2 then scales
hence W [S](a)
like t2H at large times. If we, in a similar manner, de-
ﬁne a Hurst exponent HF of the stochastic background
scales like t2HF at large times,

then H =

wavelet coeﬃcients for the log(v(t) + 2) data as obtained from
a one-lane simulation with a traﬃc intensity of 0.53 cars per

data points. All identical cars moves in this case with the
maximum speed of 5 lattice units per unit time. The density
of cars per lattice site is ρ = 0.1016. For large time-scales we
obtain an expected Hurst coeﬃcient H = 0.5 corresponding
to normal Einstein diﬀusion.

data points in time in order to illustrate our method.
The actual value of cars per site, i.e. the car density per
lattice site ρ, change very little during the simulation and
approaches p in the limit of a large lattice. The cars have
a hard core repulsion so that only one car at a time oc-
cupies a given lattice site and a speed limit restricts the
car velocities. In order to simulate the approach to an
optimal traﬃc ﬂow, a given car either speeds up or slows
down depending on the distance to the car ahead. The
velocity increases with one lattice unit per unit time if
this is allowed by the distance to the car ahead. Other-
wise the velocity is decreased with one lattice unit per
unit time (for details of the implementation of such a
simulation see e.g. Ref.[15]). In order to make a concrete
model we assume that the sound produced from a car
at the site of the detection device leads to a sound-level
L(t) = log(2 + v(t)), where v(t) is the velocity of the car
at the site in lattice units per unit time. If there is no
car present we put v(t) =
1, which simply corresponds
to no sound at all.

In Fig.1 we show the typical scaling of averaged wavelet
coeﬃcients for S(t) = log(v(t)+2) at a traﬃc intensity of
0.53 cars per unit time. The maximum speed of the cars
is 5 lattice units per unit time and p = 0.1. The actual
number of cars per lattice site, ρ, is found to be 0.1016.
For large time-scales we obtain an expected Hurst expo-
nent H = α/2 = 0.5 corresponding to normal Einstein
diﬀusion.
It is interesting to observe that this scaling
can be modelled by a constant power spectrum ρF (ω), if

We intend to discuss this feature of our model in more
detail elsewhere. Even though the ﬁrst data points cor-
responds to a linear t scaling we do not attribute much
statistical signiﬁcance to this behavior. In the next sim-
ulation we increase the density of cars, i.e. we choose
p = 0.8, but keep the rest of the parameters the same.
Due to the presence of traﬃc jamming we expect an in-
crease of the ﬂuctuations of noise at larger time scales
and therefore a large diﬀusion constant, i.e. a superdif-
fusive behavior. Due to the larger car density one may
expect a lower mean velocity and we actually ﬁnd that
< v >= 0.24 lattice units per unit time corresponding to
a lower traﬃc intensity of 0.194 cars per unit time as com-
pared to the simulation of Fig.1. As presented in Fig.2
we ﬁnd, as expected, a normal diﬀusive behavior at small
scales. At larger scales we ﬁnd a Hurst exponent close to
H = 1.0, i.e. a clear superdiﬀusive behavior. A model
for such a superdiﬀusive behavior has been discussed in
Ref.[12] in terms of a constant power spectrum ρF (ω) in
ωmax with
a ﬁnite frequency interval 0 < ωmin ≤
parameters which again opens up a window for various
ﬁnite-time behavior.

We have also performed a ﬁeld measurement of a real

for the sound-level L(t) using sound data from a real two-

time-window of one second. The conventional diﬀusive be-
havior H = 0.5 is clearly seen at small scales. At large scales
the sound-level becomes peaked around its mean value with a
white-noise power spectrum for ∆F (t)2 which, formally, cor-
responds to H = −0.5. At intermediate scales we uncover
a 1/f -noise which indicates a self-regulatory behavior of the

with sound data automatically stored [18]. We expect
conventional diﬀusion at short time-scales. At suﬃciently
large scales we expect a constant sound-level with a ﬂat
power spectrum of the sound ﬂuctuations since the pres-
ence of the common traﬃc obstacle should average out in
the data at large time scales. A ﬂat power spectrum for
the ﬂuctuations of the sound-level leads to ∆L(t)2

at large times. For medium scales it is not entirely clear
in what manner the driver of the vehicles adapts to each
other. As seen in Fig.3 we ﬁnd the expected small scale

IV. FINAL REMARKS

In summary, we have considered some aspects of the
large-time structure of traﬃc ﬂows. We have suggested
a cost-eﬀective method to collect traﬃc data in terms
of the noise of sound the traﬃcs ﬂows actually produce.
The scaling behavior observed can easily be modelled in
terms of a general form of stochastic diﬀerential equation
with memory eﬀects included which opens up an avenue
of detailed analysis. In our presentation of the method
retardation eﬀects, Doppler shifts, frequency dependence
of the sound and other features, which can be inferred
from sound observations, have all been neglected but can
be used in more realistic situations to extract details of
the monitored vehicles, ﬂow rates and other characteris-
tics of traﬃc ﬂows. Our data from a realistic traﬃc situ-
ation also suggest the presence of a 1/f noise, a feature
which has been suggested elsewhere to be of great im-
portance in the self-regulatory behavior of intense traﬃc
ﬂows [19].

Even though we have applied our methods in order
to model properties of traﬃc ﬂows, it appears that the
considerations outlined in the present paper have a much
broader range of applicability. We intend to come back
to such issues elsewhere.

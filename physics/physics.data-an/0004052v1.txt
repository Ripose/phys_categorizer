Abstract

We consider the Roe-Woodroofe construction of conﬁdence intervals for

the case of a Poisson distributed variate where the mean is the sum of a

known background and an unknown non-negative signal. We point out that

the intervals do not have coverage in the usual sense but can be made to

have such with a modiﬁcation that does not aﬀect the believability and other

desirable features of this attractive construction. A similar modiﬁcation can

be used to provide coverage to the construction recently proposed by Cousins

for the Gaussian-with-boundary problem.

I. INTRODUCTION

A problem of long-standing interest is that of setting conﬁdence intervals for an unknown

non-negative signal µ in the presence of a known mean background b when the measurement

n is Poisson distributed as p(n; µ + b). When n < b, the usual estimate for µ, i.e. n − b,
is negative, leading in most constructions to small upper limits that imply unrealistically

high conﬁdence in small values of µ. In a recent paper, Roe and Woodroofe [1] propose a

construction that produces more believable intervals and contains the unifying feature that

one need not decide beforehand whether to set a conﬁdence interval or an upper conﬁdence

bound. However, since the Roe-Woodroofe conﬁdence belt (of conﬁdence level α) is not

constructed from an unconditional probability density and does not have coverage in the

usual sense (i.e. unconditional coverage), one cannot state that the unconditional probability

of the interval enclosing the true value is at least α. Our comment is that a straightforward

modiﬁcation of the Roe-Woodroofe conﬁdence belt gives it coverage, making the construction

eﬀectively an ordering principle applied to the Poisson pdf, albeit reached by circuitous

means.

II. ROE-WOODROOFE CONFIDENCE INTERVALS

Roe and Woodroofe are motivated by the observation [1] that the measurement n = 0

implies that zero signal (as well as zero background) is seen; thus, the resulting estimate

for µ is zero, independent of b. They argue therefore that the conﬁdence interval for µ for

n=0 must be independent of b. Extending the argument, they note that for any observation

n, one has observed a result n from the Poisson pdf p(n; µ + b) and a background of at

most n. They formulate a method of obtaining conﬁdence intervals based on the conditional

probability to observe n given a background ≤ n and obtain the desired result for n = 0

2

and approximately the classical conﬁdence intervals for n > b. While they identify their

method as an ordering principle, it is not one in the same sense as Ref.s [2] and [3] which

explicitly choose a conﬁdence belt of probability α using the Poisson pdf p(n; µ + b) and the

Likelihood Ratio Construction and invert it to ﬁnd conﬁdence intervals. The latter methods

do not obtain intervals that are independent of b for n = 0 and yield conﬁdence intervals

which are unphysically small for n < b.

Although the Roe-Woodroofe construction does not have coverage in the usual sense ,

it can be easily modiﬁed to obtain coverage, by retaining the left-hand boundary of the

conﬁdence belt and adjusting the right-hand boundary so that for all µ the horizontal inter-

vals contain probability α. In Fig. 1 we show the Roe-Woodroofe 90% intervals for b = 3

along with one-sided and central conﬁdence belts ∗ for the Poisson distribution without

background. We note that the Roe-Woodroofe horizontal intervals do not coincide with the

one-sided intervals shown for µ < 2.44. Therefore for some values of µ in this range, the

conﬁdence belt does not satisfy the coverage requirement that ≥90% of the probability is
contained. Because coverage cannot be exact when the variable is discrete, the error for

the example given here is not of great numerical signiﬁcance. The minimum coverage of

∗We show the conﬁdence belt consisting of central intervals [n1(µ0), n2(µ0)] containing at least

90% of the probability for unknown Poisson mean µ0 in the absence of any known background

(dotted) and the 90% one-sided belt consisting of intervals [0, nos(µ0)](dashed). There is some

arbitrariness in the choice of a central interval for a discrete variate. We choose the smallest

interval such that there is ≥ 90% of the probability in the center and ≤5%, but as close as possible
to 5%, on the right. The alternative of requiring ≤5%, but as close as possible to 5%, on the left
gives slightly less symmetrical intervals. For the latter choice the 90% Poisson upper limit for n = 0

is µ0 = 3.0 compared to µ0 = 2.62 for our choice. For µ0 < 2.62, according to this prescription,

one cannot construct an interval containing probability > 90% that does not include n = 0 and we

adopt 90% one-sided intervals.

∼ 0.87 is obtained at µ ∼ 0.4. Undercoverage is more severe for greater b; for b = 10.0, the
minimum coverage is ∼ 0.78. However, it is desirable to have coverage, which we obtain as
shown in Fig. 2 where we have changed the right side of the conﬁdence belt so that the

horizontal intervals contain probability ≥90%. We note that the conﬁdence intervals for
small n, i.e. n < b, are unchanged. Intervals for both constructions are given in Table I.

It would be nice to devise an ordering principle that can be directly applied to the

Poisson pdf p(n; µ + b) to obtain the conﬁdence belt shown in Fig. 2, if only because the

construction we have used here is aesthetically unpleasing. This method, which consists of

ﬁrst determining vertical intervals per Ref. [1], and then ﬁxing them, leaves something to

be desired. However, in the end the method of construction does not really matter. What

results here is an ordering procedure that yields a conﬁdence belt with coverage and produces

physically sensible intervals.

B. Roe has noted [4] that our modiﬁcation is equally applicable to a construction due to

R. Cousins, in which the Roe-Woodroofe method of conditioning is applied to the Gaussian-

with-boundary [5] problem. Here, for example, an interval of conﬁdence level α is sought

for an unknown non-negative signal µ and the measurements x are normally distributed as

N(x;µ). As for the Roe-Woodroofe construction referred to above, the Cousins construction

produces physically sensible conﬁdence intervals for all x including x < 0. However this

construction signiﬁcantly undercovers for µ < 0.5 and signiﬁcantly overcovers for µ ∼ 1.
In order to produce exact coverage using the Cousins construction, we retain the left hand

(upper) curve of the conﬁdence belt xl(µ) and recalculate the right hand (lower) curve xr(µ)

so that the horizontal intervals contain probability α using:

2α = erf (

µ − xl
√2

) + erf (

xr − µ
√2

).

III. CONCLUSION

4

For the case of Poisson distributed measurements n with a non-negative signal mean

µ and known mean background b, the Roe-Woodroofe construction produces well-behaved

conﬁdence intervals, particularly for n < b where other constructions yield unphysically

small intervals. Since the construction is not based on integrating probabilities that arise

from an unconditional pdf, it does not produce a conﬁdence belt with coverage in the usual

frequentist sense. We suggest a modiﬁcation that provides coverage while preserving the

desirable features of the construction. While the changes introduced by this modiﬁcation

are relatively small for the example given here (they are larger for greater b), nevertheless

the procedure corrects a formal defect in the original construction. A similar modiﬁcation

provides coverage for a construction recently discussed by R. Cousins for the Gaussian-with-

boundary problem.

FIG. 1.

90% Poisson conﬁdence belts for unknown non-negative signal µ in the presence of

a background with known mean b taken to be 3.0, where n is the result of a single observation.

The solid belt is the Roe-Woodroofe construction, the dotted belt the central construction and the

dashed belt the one-sided construction of 90% Poisson lower limits. Here µ0 = µ+b is the parameter

representing the mean of signal plus background. We illustrate conﬁdence belts in this manner to

demonstrate the absence of coverage for the Roe-Woodroofe construction and to emphasize that a

naive approach to setting a conﬁdence interval for µ leads to a null interval for suﬃciently small

n < b, in this case n = 0. The solid line Roe-Woodroofe lower limit for n ≤ 5 is at µ = 0.

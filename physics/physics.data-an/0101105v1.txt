Deconvolution problems in x-ray absorption ﬁne structure

(January 15, 2001)

A Bayesian method application to the deconvolution of EXAFS spectra is considered. It is shown
that for purposes of EXAFS spectroscopy, from the inﬁnitely large number of Bayesian solutions it
is possible to determine an optimal range of solutions, any one from which is appropriate. Since
this removes the requirement for the uniqueness of solution, it becomes possible to exclude the
instrumental broadening and the lifetime broadening from EXAFS spectra. In addition, we propose
several approaches to the determination of optimal Bayesian regularization parameter. The Bayesian
deconvolution is compared with the deconvolution which uses the Fourier transform and optimal
Wiener ﬁltering. It is shown that XPS spectra could be in principle used for extraction of a one-
electron absorptance. The amplitude correction factors obtained after deconvolution are considered
and discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

The chief task of the extended x-ray absorption ﬁne-
structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, determination of inter-
atomic distances, rms ﬂuctuations in bond lengths etc.,
is solved mainly by means of the ﬁtting of parameterized
theoretical curves to experimental ones. However, there
exist obstacles for such a direct comparison: theory lim-
itations and systematic errors. Among latter are various
broadening eﬀects. Fist of all, (i) this is the broadening
arising from the ﬁnite energy selectivity of monochroma-
tor and the ﬁnite angular size of the x-ray beam.
(ii)
The absorption even of strictly monochromatic x-ray ir-
radiation by the electrons of a deep atomic level gives
rise to photoelectrons with the ﬁnite energy dispersion
due to the ﬁnite natural width of this level and the ﬁ-
nite lifetime of the core-hole. (iii) For x-ray energies far
above the absorption edge the process of photoelectron
creation (the outgoing from an absorbing atom) and the
process of its propagation occur for essentially diﬀerent
time intervals. In other words, just created, the photo-
electron ‘does not know’ where and how it will decay.
Therefore the photoionization from the chosen atomic
level and excitation of the remaining system can be con-
sidered as independent processes, and hence the total ab-
sorption cross-section, as a probability density of two in-
dependent random processes, is given by the convolution
of a one-electron cross-section and excitation spectrum
W (∆E). The latter is the probability density of the en-
ergy ∆E capture at the electron-hole pair creation and
is the quantity measured in x-ray photoemission spec-
troscopy (XPS). For light elements there are examples of
such deep and lengthy enough XPS spectra (see ﬁgure 1,
taken from [1]).

For all three cases the measured absorption coeﬃcient

µm is given by the convolution:

where the broadening proﬁle W (∆E) and the meaning
of the function µ depend on the considered problem.
These can be, correspondingly: x-ray spectral density
after the monochromator and the cross-section of ide-
ally monochromatic irradiation; the Lorentzian function
and the cross-section with a stationary initial level (of
zero width); the excitation spectrum and a one-electron
cross-section.

It is the common practice in modern EXAFS spec-
troscopy to account for the broadening processes (i)–(iii)
at the stage of theoretical calculations by introducing
into the one-electron scattering potential the imaginary
correlation part which represents the average interaction
between photoelectron and hole and their own polariza-
tion cloud; in doing so, the choice of the correlation part
is dictated by empiric considerations and can be diﬀerent
for diﬀerent systems.

Another approach to the account for the broadening
processes is to solve the integral equation (1) for the un-
known µ. To ﬁnd some solution of this equation is quite
not diﬃcult to do, the simplest way is to use the theorem
about the Fourier transform (FT) of convolution. How-
ever, it is known that the problem of deconvolution is
an ill-posed one: it has an unstable solution or, in other
words, the inﬁnitely large number of solutions speciﬁed
by diﬀerent realizations of the noise. Thus, there is evi-
dent necessity for determination of an optimal, in some
sense, solution. Yet a less evident approach exists: to ﬁnd
an appropriate functional of the solution which itself be
stable.

A number of works have been addressed the problem
of deconvolution, among them those concerning the x-
ray absorption spectra. Loeﬀen et al. [2] applied decon-
volution with the Lorentzian function partly eliminating
the core-hole life-time broadening. They used fast FT
and the Wiener ﬁlter which is determined from the noise
level which, in turn, is speciﬁed by the choice of the lim-
iting FT frequency above which the signal is supposed
to be less than noise. The arbitrariness of such a choice
gives rise to rather diﬀerent deconvolved spectra, which
although remained obscured in [2].

for

Recently,

the deconvolution problem with a
Lorentzian function Filipponi [3] used the FT and pro-
posed the idea of the decomposition of an experimental
spectrum into the sum of linear contribution, a special
analytic function representing the edge and oscillating
part. For the Lorentzian response, the deconvolution for
the ﬁrst two contribution is found analytically, for the
latter one, numerically. The advance of such a decom-
position is in that fact that now the FT of the oscillat-
ing part is not dominated by the very strong signal of
low frequency, therefore the combination of forward and
backward FT gives less numerical errors. Notice that
this method is solely suitable for the analytically given
response. In addition, in [3] the choice of the ﬁlter func-
tion (Gaussian curve) and its parameterization remained
vague. Therefore the issue on the uniqueness or optimal-
ity of the found solution was left open.

In early work [4], for the solution of ill-posed problems
the statistical approach was proposed. Following that
work, in the present paper we shall consider the deconvo-
lution problem in the framework of Bayesian method, de-
tailed formalism of which was described in [5]. Since the
parameterization is naturally involved in the Bayesian
method, there exists a principle possibility to choose an
optimal, in some sense, parameter. Here we shall scru-
tinize the problem of such a choice which is relevant to
any spectroscopy. We shall show that this problem is ab-
sent in EXAFS spectroscopy because though the EXAFS
spectrum itself does depend on the regularization param-
eter, its FT does not in the range of real space used for the
analysis. In Sec. II we discuss the choice of the optimal
deconvolution for a model Gaussian response and com-
pare the results of Bayesian approach with the results of
FT combined with Wiener ﬁltering. In Sec. III we utilize

the deconvolution to an experimental spectrum in order
to eliminate the aforementioned broadening processes.

II. THE CHOICE OF OPTIMAL
DECONVOLUTION

First of all, we shall show that the deconvolution prob-
lem really has the inﬁnitely large number of solutions.
In the present paper we use for examples the absorp-
tion spectrum of Nd1.85Ce0.15CuO4−δ above Cu K edge
collected at 8 K in transmission mode at LURE (beam-
line D-21) using Si(111) monochromator and harmonics
rejecting mirror; energy step
2 eV, total amount of
points 826 (from 8850 eV to 10500 eV), each one recorded
with integration time of 10 s. Let us take for a while for
the response function a simple model form: W (E) =
E2/2Γ2), where C normalizes W to unity, Γ is
C exp(
chosen to be equal to 4 eV.

In [5] we showed how to construct a regularized solu-
tion of the convolution equation in the framework of the
Bayesian approach. For that, one needs to ﬁnd eigenval-
ues and eigenvectors of a special symmetric N
N matrix
determined by the experimental spectrum, N is the num-
ber of experimental points. Using that approach, ﬁnd a
solution µ(E) for an arbitrary regularization parameter
α and perform its convolution with W . The ˆµm obtained,
ideally, must coincide with µm. Introduce the character-
istics of the solution quality, the normalized diﬀerence of
these curves:

where the summation is done over all experimental
points. Figure 2 shows the dependence R2 on α. That
fact that the quality of the found solutions is practically
the same for all α <
1 is a clear manifestation of ill-
∼
posedness of the problem: there is no a unique solution.
How to chose an optimal one? It turns out, that for pur-
poses of EXAFS spectroscopy there is no need of that and
any solution from the optimal range (here, α <
1) is suit-
∼
able. At arbitrary α from the optimal range found the de-
kw
convolution µ(E), extract the EXAFS function χ(k)
in a conventional way, where k is the photoelectron wave
number, and ﬁnd its FT. In ﬁgure 3 we show the EXAFS-
functions obtained after the Bayesian deconvolution with
α = 1 and α = 0.01, and their FT’s. As seen, although
the EXAFS-function itself does depend on α, its FT prac-
tically does not. Thus, if one uses for ﬁtting a range of
r-space (in our example, up to rmax = 8 ˚A) or ﬁltered k-
space, the problem of search for the optimal α is not rele-
vant. Nevertheless, below we propose several approaches
to the solution of this problem, for instance for XANES
spectroscopy needs.

·

(1) For the regularization parameter α itself one can
introduce the posterior probability density function [4,5]
and choose α with a maximum probability density. It can
be done either using the most probable value of noise
or assuming the standard deviation σ of the noise of
the absorption coeﬃcient to be known (for our spectrum
10−4, as determined from the FT following [6]).

d, σ), and their most prob-
d) and p(α

|
|
able values are α1 = 0.021 and α1σ = 0.044.

·

(2) The optimal regularization can be determined
from the consideration of the signal-to-noise ratio S/N .
The Shannon-Hartley theorem states that Imax =
B ln (1 + S/N ), where Imax is the maximum informa-
tion rate, B is the bandwidth. The authors of [2] are of
opinion that deconvolution is a mathematical operation
that conserves information. Therefore from the theorem
follows that one pays for an increase in bandwidth, re-
sulted from deconvolution, via a reduction in S/N ratio.
The thesis on Imax conservation is quite questionable,
since for deconvolution one should introduce additional
independent information about the proﬁle of broaden-
ing. What quantity is conserved in deconvolution is hard
to tell. Here to the contrary, for the optimal α we de-
mand to conserve S/N . Deﬁne S/N as the ratio of mean
values of the EXAFS power spectrum over two regions,
r < 15 ˚A and 15 < r < 25 ˚A. The regularization param-
eter at which the S/N is conserved is denoted in ﬁgure
2 as α2 = 5.54. The signal-to-noise ratio can be deﬁned
in a diﬀerent way. Since the Bayesian methods work
in terms of posterior density functions, for each experi-
mental point one can ﬁnd not only the mean deconvolved
value but also the standard deviation δµdeconv from which
one ﬁnds δχ = δµdeconv/µ0, where µ0 is the atomic-like

function extraction. It is reasonable to compare δχ values
with the envelope of EXAFS spectrum (ﬁgure 3, middle).
As seen, at small α the noise dominates over the signal
in the extended part of the spectrum. The regularization
parameter at which they match is the optimal one, α2.

(3) For the Bayesian deconvolution it is necessary to
ﬁnd eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a special symmetric
matrix g. It turns out that the determinant of this matrix
varies with α over hundreds orders of magnitude. At
small α’s the matrix is poorly deﬁned, large α’s yield very

errors because of ratios of very small or very large values
in calculations. As an optimal parameter we choose α3 =

The cases (1) and (2) require to determine the noise
level, which demands additional variables (for instance,
the limiting frequencies of FT). The case (3) does not
explicitly concern the noise. Due to the dependence of
lg[det(g)] on α appears to be linear, which readily allows
one to ﬁnd the optimal parameter, the case (3) is more
preferable from the practical point of view. Below, for
deconvolution of the real broadening processes we use
the optimal parameter α3.

It is of certain interest to compare the Bayesian method
of deconvolution with the widely known method combin-
ing optimal Wiener ﬁltering and the convolution theo-
rem, where the conjugate variables of the FT are not k
and 2r adopted in EXAFS but E and τ . According to

FT of the ratio µm(τ )/W (τ ) will give the thought solu-
tion µ(E) but very noisy. Therefore µm(τ ) at large τ has
to be smoothed. Figure 4 shows module of the FT of

In closing this section, it should be noticed that apart
from the possibility of determination of the deconvolu-
tion errors and the possibility of the optimal regulariza-
tion parameter choice, the Bayesian deconvolution has
the advantage of the capability to take into account a pri-
ori information about the smoothness and shape of the
solution (see details in [5]). In addition, in the Bayesian
E′) could be of
method the response function W (E
E′, E), which will be useful
more general form W (E
for deconvolution of the instrumental broadening because
monochromator energy resolution depends noticeably on
the angular position and, hence, on the energy of the
output x-ray beam.

III. APPLICATIONS OF DECONVOLUTION

We have seen that the Bayesian method proves to be
eﬀective for deconvolution of EXAFS spectra, and the
choice of the regularization parameter appears to be ir-
relevant. Now we perform the deconvolution of various
types of broadening, for which purpose specify the corre-
sponding response functions W (E

E′, E).

−

A. Instrumental broadening

The monochromator resolution is determined by the
rocking curve width δθB and by the vertical beam diver-
gence δθ⊥. For the monochromator Si(111) at E = 9 keV
the rocking curve width is δθB = 32.4 µrad (FWHM)
[8], the beam divergence (LURE, D-21) δθ⊥ = 150 µrad.
Strictly speaking, the resulting spectral distribution is
given by the convolution of rocking curve and the an-
gular beam proﬁle. But since δθB
δθ⊥, the energy
selectivity is determined by δθ⊥, namely: δE⊥/E =
δθ⊥ cot θB = δθ⊥
1, where θB is Bragg
angle, d is Bragg plane spacing. Modelling the spectral
distribution by a Gaussian function, one obtains:

where the normalization constant must be calculated at

B. Lifetime broadening

For deconvolution of the lifetime broadening described
[(∆E/ΓK)2 + 1]−1,
by a Lorentzian function W (∆E)
we take as the initial spectrum µm the spectrum µinstr ob-
tained after the instrumental deconvolution. According
to [9], the width of Cu K level (FWHM) equals 1.55 eV,
from where ΓK = 0.775 eV.

∼

There are certain diﬃculties in measuring XPS spec-
tra near (and deeper) the deepest atomic levels:
the
monochromatic x-ray sources of high energy are required;
for long enough spectra (
100 eV) a photoelectron an-
alyzer with a broad energy window and long integration
time are necessary. Unfortunately, for lack of experi-
mental XPS spectra in cuprates near Cu 1s level, we
can use a model representation of the response W (∆E).
For that we take the estimations of position, intensity
and width of the secondary KM23 excitation from [10]:
EK = 85 eV; IKM23 /IK = 0.03; ΓKM23 = 3 eV.

IV. DISCUSSION

With the speciﬁed response functions W , perform the
Bayesian deconvolution of the absorption coeﬃcient at
the optimal regularization parameter, then construct the
EXAFS function for which calculate FT and the ampli-
tudes and phases (see ﬁgure 5). Just as for the model re-
sponse in Sec. II, the deconvolution leads to the increase
of EXAFS oscillations. As appeared, the deconvolution
has practically no inﬂuence on the ﬁrst FT peak origi-
nating from the shortest scattering path. It is clear why:
the oscillations corresponding to this peak are essentially
wider then the response W (for these, W is almost a δ-
function), and this is more true for the extended part of
a spectrum, due to the period of the oscillations there
is even longer (in E-space). Thus, it is in the extended
part where µ, the solution of equation (1), less diﬀers
from µm.

In modern EXAFS spectroscopy the diﬀerence between
amplitudes of experimental and calculated spectra are
taken into account by the reduction factor S2
0 which is
either treated as a ﬁtting parameter or estimated from

FIG. 5. Module of the FT of various EXAFS functions:
initial; obtained from the instrumentally deconvolved absorp-
tance; the latter was deconvolved with the Lorentzian re-
sponse and with the total multielectron response, these two
give the EXAFS FT’s practically merged. Bottom: the ratio
of amplitudes of initial χ and deconvolved χ. The S2

was calculated from atomic overlap integrals.

the relaxation of the core-hole as the many-electron over-
lap integral. In many works this factor is considered to
be independent from energy, however, as noted in review
by Rehr and Albers [11], it must be path-dependent and
energy-dependent. At the bottom of ﬁgure 5 we draw
the ratios A(k) of the amplitude of initial EXAFS spec-
trum to that of the deconvolved one. Here, they were
calculated relatively both χm and χinstr. For comparison
we show the factor S2
0 as computed by feff code [12].
At large k, where the noise become comparable with the
EXAFS signal, the ratios A(k) have signiﬁcant errors.
However, the general trend of the curves corresponds to
the expected one [13]: A(k) is minimal at intermediate
EXAFS energies, while at both low and high energy A(k)
reduces to unity. In addition, there are some phase shifts
between the initial spectrum and the deconvolved ones.
But these shifts are found to be quite small:
less than
0.2 rad at k < 4 ˚A and less than 0.1 rad at k > 4 ˚A.

The Lorentzian broadening of the EXAFS spectrum
with a half-width Γ is similar to the eﬀect of the imagi-
nary part of the self-energy with Im Σ = Γ. The resulting
reduction factors, i.e. the ratios the of amplitudes calcu-
lated with and without the imaginary part, are analogous

to the reduction factors obtained by us relatively χinstr:
A(k) = am(χinstr)/am(χdeconv). However, up to now the
reduction factors relatively measured EXAFS spectrum
were considered, A(k) = am(χm)/am(χdeconv). As seen
(ﬁgure 5), these are the noticeably diﬀerent quantities.
That is why for the correct analysis and comparison of
spectra taken at diﬀerent experimental conditions, the
instrumental deconvolution must be the ﬁrst step.

For our example spectrum and the chosen response
functions, deconvolution of the lifetime broadening and
deconvolution of the multielectron broadening are practi-
cally undistinguishable (ﬁgure 5, top), i.e. the secondary
weak peak in the excitation spectrum W (∆E) has very
little eﬀect. The main eﬀect of using real excitation
spectra is expected from the presence and taking into
account the plasmon losses which have a considerable
integral weight (ﬁgure 1). Because of their very broad
spectral distribution, their eﬀect consists in the change
of the EXAFS spectrum as a whole. In the present paper
this contribution was not taken into account for lack of
appropriate experimental information.

Near the absorption edge, where the photoelectron ki-
netic energy is low, the core-hole relaxation processes are
of certain importance for the photoelectron propagation.
Here we do not consider the validity of the neglect of this
eﬀect, but refer to the review [11].

To take into account the many-electron eﬀects, there
exist, in principle, two approaches: (a) to include into
a one-electron theory relevant amendments or (b) to ex-
tract a one-electron absorptance from the total one and
to use then a pure one-electron theory. The ﬁrst, tra-
ditional, approach invokes semi-empirical rules, but not
ab initio calculations, to construct the exchange corre-
lation part of the scattering potential, with the empiri-
cism being based on the comparison with experimental
spectra already broadened. In the present paper we have
shown the principle way for the second approach, using
the solution of integral convolution equation, the kernel
in which is the excitation spectrum measured in XPS
spectroscopy. Notice, that owing to the speciﬁc way of
the structural information extraction from the EXAFS
spectra, in which an isolated signal in r-space or a ﬁl-
tered signal in k-space is used, we have not committed
a sin against the fact that the integral convolution equa-
tion is an ill-posed problem, because from the inﬁnitely
large number of solutions it is possible to determine an
optimal range, also inﬁnitely large, of solutions any one
from which is appropriate.

Because of some technical diﬃculties, it is impossible
so far to measure XPS spectra near deep core levels.
Therefore, the desirable pure one-electron absorptance
is unavailable. Nevertheless, as we have shown, it is pos-
sible to perform an accurate instrumental deconvolution

and deconvolution of the lifetime broadening. These pro-
cedures make the comparison between calculated and ex-
perimental spectra more immediate and the ﬁnal results
of EXAFS spectroscopy more reliable.

All the stages of EXAFS spectra processing including
those described here are realized in the freeware program

Abstract We have studied the performance of a new algorithm for electron/pion
separation in an Emulsion Cloud Chamber (ECC) made of lead and nuclear emul-
sion ﬁlms. The software for separation consists of two parts: a shower reconstruction
algorithm and a Neural Network that assigns to each reconstructed shower the prob-
ability to be an electron or a pion. The performance has been studied for the ECC
of the OPERA experiment [1].

The e/π separation algorithm has been optimized by using a detailed Monte
Carlo simulation of the ECC and tested on real data taken at CERN (pion beams)
and at DESY (electron beams). The algorithm allows to achieve a 90% electron
identiﬁcation eﬃciency with a pion misidentiﬁcation smaller than 1% for energies
higher than 2 GeV.

Introduction

The Emulsion Cloud Chamber [2, 3] consists of a modular structure made of a sand-
wich of passive material plates interleaved with emulsion ﬁlms.
It combines the
high-precision tracking capabilities of nuclear emulsions and the large mass achiev-
able by employing passive material as a target. Among past applications the ECC
was successfully used in the DONUT experiment for the ﬁrst direct observation of
the tau-neutrino [4]. By assembling a large quantity of ECC modules, it is pos-
sible to realize O(kton) ﬁne-grained vertex detector optimized for the study of ντ
appearance.

The ECC has been adopted by the OPERA Collaboration [1, 5] for a long-
baseline search of νµ → ντ oscillations. OPERA is designed to obtain a unambiguous
signature (observation of ντ appearance) of νµ → ντ oscillations in the parameter
region indicated by atmospheric neutrino experiments [6, 7, 8, 9] and conﬁrmed
by long-baseline experiments with accelerator neutrinos: K2K [10] in Japan and
MINOS [11] in the USA. The detector is located in the underground Gran Sasso
Laboratory.
It exploits the Cern to Gran Sasso (CNGS) beam, optimised for ντ
appearance, with a baseline of 730 km [12]. OPERA is a hybrid experiment based
on the use of ECC and of electronic detectors for a rough location of the events
in the ECC and for full event reconstruction. The basic OPERA ECC module has
dimensions of 12.7×10.2×7.5 cm3; it consists of a sequence of 56 lead plates (1 mm
thick) and 57 emulsion ﬁlms (44 µm thick emulsion layers on either side of a 205
µm thick plastic base [13]). The total length of an OPERA ECC module is about
10 X0.

In addition to the decay detection of short-lived particles [14], the ECC allows
momentum measurement by Multiple Coulomb Scattering [15] and the particle iden-
tiﬁcation through ionization measurement [16].

The high granularity of the emulsions also allows an excellent electromagnetic
shower identiﬁcation, hence the separation of electrons and pions. This is obtained
by exploiting their diﬀerent behavior in passing through and interacting in an ECC.
In the 1-10 GeV energy range, of interest for OPERA, electrons loose energy essen-
tially by bremsstrahlung and charged pions mainly by ionization. This motivates
two complementary approaches to identify electrons and pions:

• an electron quickly develops an electromagnetic shower in lead (critical energy
∼ 10 MeV). The total number of tracks, as well as the diﬀerent longitudinal and
transverse proﬁles of the showers, can be then used for particle identiﬁcation;

• going through a material, the energy remains almost constant for pions whilst

strongly decreases for electrons. Therefore, Multiple Coulomb Scattering presents
diﬀerent longitudinal proﬁles for electrons and pions, that a χ2-based separator
may be built. A method based on this approach is possible with an ECC and
is described in [17], where it is shown that an electron eﬃciency of 90% with a
pion contamination of 6% is achievable by using 56 emulsion ﬁlms interleaved
with lead plates. Another study [18] shows that with this method it is possible

2

to achieve an electron eﬃciency above 90% for a pion contamination not lower
than 5% by using 30 emulsion ﬁlms.

In this paper we follow the ﬁrst approach by using a new algorithm for shower
reconstruction and a new algorithm based on a Neural Network (NN) for e/π sep-
aration. A preliminary study to exploit a Neural Network for this purpose was
presented in [19].

2 Data taking with test-beams

Experimental data have been collected in an electron beam at DESY and in a pion
beam at CERN.

The ECC exposures to pions took place in the CERN PS-T7 beam-line with
beams of 2, 4 and 6 GeV. The electronic detector setup consisted of a Cherenkov
counter, two scintillation counters, two multi-wire chambers and a lead-glass cen-
tered on the beam line. In order to reduce the electron contamination, a 2.5 cm
thick lead preshower was added upstream of the last focusing magnet1 of the T7
beam line and upstream from the Cherenkov counter. The electron contamination
was measured by using the combined information of the Cherenkov and lead-glass
detectors. It amounted to ∼0.6% at 2 GeV and was less than 0.4% at 4 and 6 GeV.
The muon contamination was measured by analyzing passing through tracks in the
ECC under test (∼38% at 2 GeV, ∼6% at 4 and 6 GeV) [18].
In order to have
reasonable statistics, the ECCs integrated a beam intensity corresponding to about
2000 tracks/cm2. The incident angle of the beam with respect to the ECC emulsion
ﬁlms was 50 mrad.

Electron data were taken at DESY T24 beam-line, where a sub-Hz rate per cm2
was achieved in the energy range from 1 to 6 GeV. The sub-Hz rate was mandatory
in order to achieve a small particle density in the ECC, as needed to avoid overlaps
of electromagnetic showers. The electronic detector setup consisted of three scintil-
lation counters used as a trigger, a multi-wire chamber to measure the beam proﬁle
and a lead-glass calorimeter for electron energy measurement. Two ECCs, both
with 20 emulsion ﬁlms, were exposed to electrons: one at 6 GeV high density (100
particles/cm2) beam and one at 3 GeV low density (1 particle/cm2) beam. A third
ECC was brought to DESY but not exposed, in order to estimate the background
accumulated from ECC production to the emulsion development. The low energy
contamination of the beam, due to the interactions of the electrons with the beam
pipe and the beam-line elements, was estimated to be 5.7% at 1 GeV and 2.3% at
6 GeV.

The emulsion ﬁlms have been scanned by using the European Scanning System
(ESS) developed for the high-speed automatic scanning of the OPERA emulsion

1Given the beam line conﬁguration, it was not possible to locate the preshower before the last
bending magnet, where it would have been most eﬃcient. Anyhow, a signiﬁcative reduction of the
electron contamination in the beam was achieved.

speed particle tracking for the ESS is described in [22], precision measurements in
[23], alignments with cosmic ray muons in [24] and event analysis in [25].

3 The shower reconstruction

The algorithm for the reconstruction of the shower follows an iterative procedure.
For each base-track3 (in the following called ”selector”) base-tracks matching it in the
downstream ﬁlms are searched for. The matching criteria are based on angular and
position requirements. The angular displacement δθ is deﬁned as the angle diﬀerence
between the selector and the base-track candidate; the position displacement δr is
the transverse distance between the selector and the candidate extrapolated back to
the selector. Any matched candidate becomes a selector and so on. In order to take
into account the reconstruction eﬃciency, a base-track candidate is allowed to be
extrapolated back at most for 3 ﬁlms, then it is discarded. Monte Carlo simulations
have shown that an adequate background rejection is achieved if one sets δθ < 50
mrad and δr < 100 µm .

In order to minimize the background, a ﬁducial volume cut around the shower
axis is applied. Base-tracks must be within a cone (with axis deﬁned by the slope
of the ﬁrst base-track belonging to the shower) with an opening angle of 20 mrad.
This angle has been optimized by a Monte Carlo simulation where each track has
been digitized by using the tools described in [26, 27].
In addition, in order to
minimize showers’ overlaps, one requires that the radius of the cone does not exceed
400 µm. Therefore, beyond 15 emulsion ﬁlms the cone becomes a cylinder with 400
µm radius. To further reduce the background, one removes base-tracks previously
assigned to a track starting outside the ﬁducial volume. Finally, one imposes that
showers traverse at least 4 emulsion ﬁlms. The eﬃciency to collect base-tracks
belonging to the shower is shown in Fig. 1. A reconstructed 6 GeV electron shower
is shown in Fig. 2.

The performance of the algorithm has been tested with experimental data and
tuned with a detailed Monte Carlo simulation [26, 27]. The main sources of inef-
ﬁciency come from the scanning of the emulsion ﬁlms and from the requirement
on the minimum length of the shower (> 3 ﬁlms). The eﬃciency of the shower
reconstruction algorithm as a function of the energy is given in Table 1. The errors
given in the table and in the following ones are statistical only. The probability for
a particle to be correctly identiﬁed is given by the product of the above eﬃciencies
and of the ones given by the NN, discussed in the following Section.

2A scanning system for the high-speed automatic scanning of the emulsion ﬁlms (called SUTS)

has been developed also in Japan [20]

3A base-track is obtained connecting through the plastic base two segments (micro-tracks) re-
constructed in each emulsion layer. For details on the micro-track and base-track reconstruction
we refer to [22].

tromagnetic shower.

4 The Neural Network

Particle identiﬁcation is performed through an algorithm based on a Neural Network
[28]. Each reconstructed shower is fed into the NN. The longitudinal proﬁle and the
number of base-tracks (shown in Fig. 3) as well as the δr and δθ distributions (shown
in Fig. 4) are very diﬀerent for electron and pions. They are used as inputs for the
NN.

The ECC exposed to the DESY beam had 20 emulsion ﬁlms, together with the
lead plates corresponding to ∼3.3 X0. We will present in Section 5.3 a Monte Carlo
study if the ESS performance as a function of the number of ﬁlms, i. e. the traversed
thickness in terms of radiation lengths. With 20 emulsion ﬁlms to reconstruct the
shower the NN has 23 input variables, deﬁned as follows:

• 1 variable corresponding to the number of base-tracks in the reconstructed

shower (nbtk) (Fig. 3 top);

• 18 variables describing the longitudinal proﬁle (Fig. 3 bottom). The ﬁrst two

bins are removed since they are very similar for pions and electrons;

• 2 variables corresponding to the mean and the RMS of the δr distribution

(Fig. 4 top);

(Fig. 4 bottom).

• 2 variables corresponding to the mean and the RMS of the δθ distribution

Besides the 23 input neurons, the NN has two hidden layers with 63 and 21 neu-
rons, and one output neuron. The training is stopped after 120 ”epochs” when the
predeﬁned “sampling error”, computed on the validation sample, reaches a plateau

tively, as:

ǫe→e ≡ ne→e

where ne→e (nπ→e) is the number of electrons (pions) classiﬁed as electrons by the
NN and Ne (Nπ) is the total number of true electrons (pions) sent to the NN. The
pion eﬃciency ǫπ→π and the electron contamination ηe→π are similarly deﬁned.

Figure 4: Distribution of δr (top) and δθ (bottom) for electrons and pions of 6 GeV.

The particle identiﬁcation is performed by applying a cut on the output neuron
value, that ranges between 0 and 1 (Fig. 5). The actual cut depends on the analysis
needs. For example, for some analyses a high electron identiﬁcation eﬃciency is
required, to a certain extent regardless the pion misidentiﬁcation ηπ→e. For other
applications a small ηπ→e is specially important. Here, we study two selections. One
demands a high electron eﬃciency (ǫe→e > 80%) regardless the pion misidentiﬁcation
(from now on Selection A). The other demands low pion misidentiﬁcation (ηπ→e <
1%) regardless the electron identiﬁcation eﬃciency (from now on Selection B). Given
both the small number of tracks associated to an electromagnetic shower and the
large contribution from the pion charge exchange process in the low energy range
(< 2 GeV), this is the most diﬃcult region where to achieve simultaneously a good
ǫe→e and a low ηπ→e. The value of the cut is imposed at 1 GeV and applied at all
energies. The results shown in this paper can be further improved by applying an
energy dependent cut. The study of the measurement of the electromagnetic shower
energy is in progress and will be the subject of a forthcoming publication.

Ideal case of absence of background

In this Section we present the results on the electron identiﬁcation eﬃciency and on
the pion contamination obtained with simulated events in the absence of background.
Only pure pion and electron events are generated and reconstructed with the shower
algorithm presented in Section 3.

The NN has been trained using ∼ 14500 electron and ∼ 16500 pion events with
a ﬂat energy spectrum in the range 0.5 to 6 GeV. The validation sample, diﬀerent
than the training sample, contained about 800 electrons and 800 pions with energies
of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 GeV. The results of the validation sample re shown in Fig.
6. Table 2 shows that if Selection A is tuned at 1 GeV, an electron identiﬁcation
eﬃciency larger than 80% can be obtained over the whole energy range with a
contamination from pion misindentiﬁcation of about 1% for energies above 2 GeV.

9

ηπ→e is much higher for lower energies. If Selection B is tuned at 1 GeV, ηπ→e is
below 1% for energies above 1 GeV and an electron identiﬁcation eﬃciency lower
than 80% for energies ≤ 2 GeV is obtained. In general, for energies lower than 1
GeV it is very diﬃcult to reach a small pion misidentiﬁcation, because of the pion
charge exchange reaction and to the relatively small number of base-tracks in the
electromagnetic showers.

5.2 Test-beam data and comparison with simulations

In order to train the NN under conditions similar to the test-beam exposure, we
added some background to the simulated sample. The background accumulated
in the emulsions has been obtained by scanning emulsion ﬁlms not exposed to the
beams and has been added by software to simulated events.

We have evaluated the background that is accepted by the shower algorithm. We
found that the fraction of fake base-tracks associated to a shower does not exceed
5%. In order to study the eﬀect of the background on the performance of the NN,
we applied the same cut on the output neuron value as in Section 5.1. The results
are shown in Tables 3 and 4 for selections A and B, respectively. By comparing the
results for simulated events given in Tables 3 and 4 with those given in Table 2,
one sees that the electron eﬃciency is worsened by about 5% with respect to the
case without background. The pion to electron misidentiﬁcation is mildly aﬀected
(except for energies below 1 GeV) by the presence of background.

Table 4: Electron eﬃciency and pion contamination for simulated and test-beam
data assuming Selection B. The output NN value is ﬁxed at 0.82.

The NN trained with the background superimposed to the simulated data has
then been applied to the test-beam data described in Section 2. For the ECC with
3 GeV low-density electrons (1 electron/cm2) an area containing only 5 electrons,
identiﬁed by the known angle of the beam with respect to emulsion ﬁlms, has been
measured. For the ECC with 6 GeV high-density electrons (100 electrons/cm2), the
number of electrons contained in the scanned area is estimated to be about 670.
Among those, 620 electrons satisfy the shower reconstruction criteria (Section 3)
and are fed in the NN. For 2, 4, 6 GeV pions, 2747, 2548, 1591 events, respectively,
have been fed into the NN. They have been selected by using the known angle of
the beam with respect to the emulsion ﬁlms.

The results obtained with real data are summarized in Tables 3 and 4 for Selec-
tion A and B, respectively. One can see that the results with test-beam data agree
reasonably well with the simulation. Note that the pion beam exploited during the
ECC exposures had an intrinsic electron contamination of about 0.5%, see Section
2. The lower limit at 95% C.L. shown in Table 3 has been computed assuming a
binomial distribution [29]. We computed a lower limit since all electron-beam tracks
(5 in total) have been correctly identiﬁed.

Having checked the reliability of the Monte Carlo simulation, as described in the
previous Section, we have studied ǫe→e and ηπ→e as a function of the number of tra-
versed emulsions ﬁlms in the energy range 0.5 to 8 GeV. Events have been simulated
for 15 (∼ 2.5X0), 30 (∼ 5.0X0) and 50 (∼ 8.3X0) emulsion ﬁlms interleaved with 1
mm thick lead plates. The results are shown in Tables 5 and 6 for Selection A and
B, respectively. The upper limits (95% C.L.) have been computed assuming a bino-
mial distribution [29]. We have computed upper limits since none of the pion-beam
tracks (800 in total) has been misidentiﬁed as an electron.

Going from 15 to 30 emulsion ﬁlms, the electron identiﬁcation and the pion

12

misidentiﬁcation improve both for Selection A and Selection B. However, adding
more ﬁlms slightly worsen the performance. In fact, adding more ﬁlms the ﬁducial
volume, as deﬁned in Section 3, increases and the signal/background ratio decreases.
An improvement of the performance could be obtained by using in the analysis an
energy dependent number of ﬁlms.

Impact of a cosmic-ray exposure on the e/π separation

During the OPERA running, each ECC tagged as a candidate to host a neutrino
interaction is extracted from the target and, before its unpacking for the development
of the emulsion ﬁlms, exposed to cosmic-rays at a facility outside the underground

13

hall. ECCs are exposed in a site shielded by a 40 cm iron slab from the cosmic-
ray electromagnetic component. With this conﬁguration, cosmic-ray muons hit the
ECC with a rate of ∼2 muons/mm2/day inside a 400 mrad cone with respect to the
vertical direction. This provides reference tracks useful to intercalibrate and align
the emulsion ﬁlms [24]. Cosmic muons have an average momentum of ∼4 GeV, and
about 70% of them have a momentum larger than 1 GeV. Some high energy muons
produce bremsstrahlung photons and initiate an electromagnetic cascade. We have
studied the impact of this cosmic-ray background on the e/π separation.

The cosmic-ray exposure conditions and their interaction products have been
simulated and the muons traced inside the ECC down to 1 MeV kinetic energy. We
have simulated the background accumulated in 1, 2 and 3 days and superimposed
it to the simulated data presented in Section 5.2. No eﬀect on the e/π separation
is observed for energies ≥ 2 GeV, as shown in Fig. 7. A slight worsening of the
performance is observed only at 1 GeV.

6 Conclusion

We present the performance of a new algorithm for e/π separation in an Emulsion
Cloud Chamber (ECC) made of emulsion ﬁlms interleaved with lead plates. The
algorithm consists of two parts: a shower reconstruction algorithm and a Neural
Network that assigns to each reconstructed shower the probability to be an elec-
tron or a pion. The performance have been studied for the ECC of the OPERA

14

experiment in the CNGS beam.

We show that the shower reconstruction algorithm has an eﬃciency higher than
90% for energies above 1 GeV. We have shown that, depending on the requirements
of the analysis, it is possible to achieve either high electron identiﬁcation eﬃciency
(more than 80%) or small pion misidentiﬁcation (smaller than 1%).

This study is relevant for the search of νµ → ντ and νµ → νe oscillations by the
OPERA experiment in the CNGS. Given the ﬂexibility of the algorithm it can be
easily adapted to OPERA analyses, whose requirements may be conﬂicting. As an
example, the νµ → νe oscillations analysis requires very low pion misidentiﬁcation
[30], while the rejection of the background from νe and ¯νe induced charm production
requires high eﬃciency electron identiﬁcation.

We also studied the impact of the exposure of an lead/emulsion ECC to cosmic-
rays as required for ﬁlm alignment and intercalibration in OPERA. It was shown
that after 3 days of cosmic-ray exposure the electron to pion separation deteriorates
only very slightly.

Abstract

In this work we present a method to detect, identify and characterize stochastic
information contained in an electrocardiogram (ECG). We assume, as it is well
known, that the ECG has information corresponding to many diﬀerent processes
related to the cardiac activity. We analyze scaling and Markov processes proper-
ties of the detected stochastic information using the power spectrum of the ECG
and the Fokker-Planck equation respectively. The detected stochastic information
is then characterized by three measures. First, the slope of the power spectrum in a
particular range of frequencies as a scaling parameter. Second, an empirical estima-
tion of the drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients of the Fokker-Planck equation through the
Kramers-Moyal coeﬃcients which deﬁne the evolution of the probability distribution
of the detected stochastic information.

Key words: Stochastic processes; Electrocardiograms

1 Introduction

The analysis of ECGs, or electrocardiography, remains the best non-invasive
method for detecting or predicting coronary artery disease, it is also a very
practical and nonexpensive method to obtain useful information about the
quality of the cardiac activity. In the last few years, new concepts and methods
from diﬀerent ﬁelds of physics have been applied to the analysis of ECGs.
The ECG can be considered as time series of measurements of an observable,
i.e. the electrical activity of the heart recorded from the body surface. This
approach has given some interesting results and provided new tools to deﬁne
new measures of great potential for the characterization of the cardiac activity.

These new measures are able to detect information contained in the ECGs
not accessible with traditional methods. Such new useful information may
be a mixture of both, stochastic and deterministic information, that has to
be unraveled and analyzed with correspondingly diﬀerent methods. In this
work we present a method and some interesting results to analyze ECGs as
time series by detecting and characterizing the stochastic information in the
context of Markov processes. In section 2 we present the problem of extracting
stochastic information from a broad band power spectrum. In section 3 we
present the method to characterize the detected stochastic information in the
context of Markov processes applied to healthy and pathologic ECGs. Section
5 is devoted to discussion and some conclusions.

2 Detecting stochastic information in ECGs

In a previous work we developed a method to separate deterministic and
stochastic information from ECGs using the power spectrum, PS, of the ECG
[1]. The fundamental idea was to improve the 1/f behavior of the broad band
power spectrum, BBPS, of the ECG in certain range of frequencies. This
method uses an archetypal reconstruction of the ECG [2,3]. The diﬀerence
between the original ECG and the archetypal reconstruction is considered the
preliminary stochastic information, PSI. The ﬁnal stochastic information, SI,
was obtained by adjusting the power spectrum of the PSI to the best 1/f α
power spectrum. The 1/f α power spectrum transformed back to the time
space was considered the SI, (the diﬀerence between the 1/f α and the power
spectrum of the diﬀerence between the original ECG and its archetypal re-
construction, transformed back to the time space, was considered part of the
deterministic information). This process was partially successful because the
detected SI obtained from the ECGs, showed interesting diﬀerences between
healthy and pathologic ECGs when analyzed as Markov processes. However,
the archetypal reconstruction is not necessarily a method to separate the de-
terministic and stochastic information, it is a better or worse reconstruction
of the whole ECG (depending on the size of the base in use) with its deter-
ministic and stochastic components mixed. The reconstruction of the ECG
with a scale dependent base, such as wavelets, complemented by a process of
ﬁtting the BBPS to a four parameter function is work in progress to improve
the extraction of the SI from the ECG. In this work we use some preliminary
results of the mentioned work in progress as the SI to be used and diﬀerentiate
healthy and pathologic cases. Despite the preliminary character of the results
used as the SI obtained from 21 healthy and 30 pathologic ECGs [4], we found
important qualitative results of one measure that can distinguish diﬀerent be-
tween the healthy and pathologic cases where other measures do not capture
such diﬀerence. This measure is the diﬀusion parameter of the Fokker-Planck

to estimate it is presented below with some results.

3 Characterizing stochastic information from ECGs

The ECGs have broad band power spectra, BBPS, with complex structure but
with approximately 1/f α behavior for an important range of the frequency do-
main. The frequency range where the SI is going to be characterized goes from
∼ 7Hz to ∼ 20Hz. Smaller and larger frequencies may be strongly aﬀected by
a variety of artifacts related with the diﬀerent measurement and recording
conditions for each ECG associated with nonstationarity and noise contami-
nations respectively. Indeed, these two regions of the PS are more correlated
to the data base used than to the healthy or pathologic character of the ECGs.
The estimated value of α is a ﬁrst characteristic of the SI obtained from the
ECG. The diﬀerent values of α estimated from all the SI obtained from each
ECG do not permit us to distinguish between healthy and pathologic cases
considering the mentioned range of frequencies. The following procedure will
give us two more measures to characterize the SI obtained from from ECGs.

These two measures are obtained by analyzing the stochastic information con-
tained in the ECG in the context of Markov processes. First, we must give

evidences of Markov properties of the stochastic information. The following
equation, Chapman-Kolmogorov, must hold if the time series under analysis
corresponds to Markov processes [5]:

p(x1, τ1 | x3, τ3) =

where p(x1, τ1 | x2, τ2) is the conditional probability density of ﬁnding the value
x1 at time τ1 given the value x2 at time τ2. Evidence of such condition may be
calculated from the time series and observed graphically in the contour lines
of Fig. 2. Similarity of the left plot with the right one is evidence of Markov
processes.

The evidence of Markov process corresponding to the SI obtained from all the
ECGs may be improved for certain values of the parameters of the method
mentioned in section 2, compared with the archetypal reconstruction used
in previous works to obtain the SI. With such evidences we can apply an
empirical determination of the coeﬃcients D1 and D2 of the Fokker-Planck
equation [7]

The Fokker-Planck equation (2), deﬁnes the evolution of the probability dis-
tributions p(x, τ ) of the Markov process at time scales deﬁned by τ . The
coeﬃcients D1 and D2, drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients respectively, completely
determine the Fokker-Planck equation [7,5,6]. Therefore, the coeﬃcients D1
and D2 can be used to characterize the stochastic information detected in the
ECG as a Markov process.

In ﬁgure 3 we present the estimates of the coeﬃcients D1 and D2 for the
SI obtained from one representative pathologic ECG and one representative
healthy ECG. We expect that the improvement of the procedure to obtain the
SI and the quantiﬁcation of these results will give a better and more roboust
measure to distinguish healthy and pathologic ECG. However, in this work
we report the potential of this measure and the method to obtain its values
using the ECG as the unique source of information.

4 Discussion and Conclusions

Despite the preliminary character of the SI obtained from ECGs, the esti-
mated values of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D2 allows as to identify interesting

5

new diﬀerences between healthy and pathologic cases. As it is observed in Fig.
3, the plot of D2 as a function of x for the healthy cases did not present a
global minimum for x = 0 and a regular parabolic behavior as was the case for
the pathologic cases. This observation is consistent with previous results and a
general consensus that healthier cardiac activity corresponds to more complex
and less regular behaviors, patterns, measures, etc. There were two exccep-
tions to this observation, one pathologic and one healthy case. So far, we have
not observed relevant information in the diﬀerent estiamted values of the drift
coeﬃcient D1, that may be useful to distinguish healthy and pathologic ECGs.
For all the ECGs analyzed, the corresponding BBPS can be qualitatively clas-
siﬁed in two distinctive groups corresponding more or less to the healthy and
pathologic ECGs. However, the diﬀerences used to deﬁne these two groups
correspond to very low and very high frequency ranges of the BBPS where
external factors of the measuring and recording processes strongly aﬀect the
information contained in the ECG. In the frequency range between ∼ 7Hz and
∼ 20Hz, we observe that all the BBPS are very similar qualitatively but very
diﬀerent quantitatively as indicated by the values of the measure α. However,
the diﬀerent values of α do not allow to make a clear clasiﬁcation of healthy
and pathologic cases.

The power spectrum does not tell you the frequency

(Dated: 27 March 2002)

A deﬁnition of frequency (cycles per unit-time) based on the reconstructed attractor of an oscil-
lator is introduced and shown to be invariant under linear ﬁltering. It is inaccessible by spectral
methods. The eﬀect of ﬁltering on frequency when this deﬁnition does not perfectly apply is quan-
tiﬁed.

PACS numbers: 05.45.Tp, 06.30.Ft, 05.45.Xt

Measuring oscillation frequencies is a basic technique
used in nearly all ﬁelds of science. The idea behind the
concept “frequency” is simple: For an ideal, periodically
oscillating signal x(t), the smallest number T > 0 such
that x(t) = x(t + T ) for all t is the period of the signal,
and its (angular) frequency is ω = 2π/T . For non-ideal
oscillations, two major kinds of methods can be distin-
guished to determine the frequency: Firstly, there are
period-counting methods, where, from the number of os-
cillation periods n(∆t) in a time interval [t0, t0 + ∆t], the
frequency is determined as

ωcount = lim

∆t→∞

2πn(∆t)
∆t

.

(1)

(Finite sample-size eﬀects are not discussed here.) De-
pending on the criteria used for counting individual pe-
riods (e.g., local maxima, zero-crossings), these meth-
ods are applicable to more or less distorted oscillations.
Secondly, there are several spectral methods, where the
frequency ωspec characterizes the position of a peak in
an estimate of the power spectral density Sx(ω) of the
signal x(t) (e.g., [1, 2]). Often the frequency with max-
imum power ωpeak is used. The term spectral methods
shall here also include methods based on estimates of the
autocorrelation function of the signal, since this is re-
lated to the spectral density by a simple Fourier transfor-
mation. Period-counting methods are routinely used in
high-precision frequency measurements. They are natu-
rally associated with mode-locking phenomena [3]. Spec-
tral methods are preferred when the periodicity of the
signal is so much distorted that standard period-counting
methods would fail.

For an ideal periodic signal on ﬁnds, with suﬃciently
long samples, ωcount = ωspec with most methods in use.
But how about non-ideal periodicity? By the simple fact
that oscillations with high amplitude make a stronger
contribution to the power spectrum than oscillations with
low amplitude, while period-counting methods are gen-
erally designed to be independent of variations in the
signal amplitude, it is of little surprise that ωcount and
ωspec generally diﬀer for non-ideal oscillations when the
length of individual periods and the amplitude are cor-
related. But intuitively one expects this diﬀerence to be
small (see, e.g., Ref. [4], p. 226).

Is there is an upper bound for this diﬀerence, perhaps
related to the line width or other features of the spec-
tral density? As is shown below, no upper bound can
be obtained from Sx(ω) alone: With an appropriate cri-
terion for period counting, which is based on the recon-
structed phase-space trajectory of the oscillator, a signal
with ﬁxed, sharply deﬁned oscillation frequency ωcount
can have a practically arbitrary spectral density.

This statement will be formulated and proven rigor-
ously after giving an appropriate deﬁnition of n(t) and
the corresponding notion of topological frequency, which
generalizes ωcount. The main move in the proof is to show
that the topological frequency is invariant under ﬁltering.
Noisy, weakly nonlinear oscillations are discussed sepa-
rately in the sequel, as for these the topological frequency
is not deﬁned, and results hold only approximately.

The theory becomes more transparent in a discrete-
time representation. Let {xt} be an inﬁnite, real-valued
time series sampled at equally spaced times starting at
t = 0. Measure time in units of the sampling interval.
Deﬁne the spectral density Sx(ω) of {xt} as

Sx(ω) =

where h·it denotes temporal averaging (t ≥ 0).

(cid:10)

Let the trajectory p(t) of a time series {xt} in
N -dimensional delay space be deﬁned by p(t) =
(xt, xt−1, . . . , xt−N +1) for integer t and by linear inter-
polation for non-integer t. Frequency will here be deﬁned
with respect to a Poincar´e section or counter, which is an
(N − 1)-dimensional, oriented manifold M with bound-
ary ∂M and interior Int M = M \∂M , embedded in the
N -dimensional delay space.

Let n(t1) be the oriented number of transitions of
the trajectory p(t) through Int M in the time interval
0 < t < t1. That is, a transition though Int M in positive
(negative) direction increments (decrements) n(t1) by
one. For example, a positive-slope zero-crossing counter
in 2-dimensional delay space would be given by [13]

M = {(v1, v2) ∈ R2|v1 + v2 = 0, v1 ≥ v2}.

(3)

Deﬁne the topological frequency ωM,x of {xt} with re-

2

spect to a counter M , as

(4)

,

ωM,x := lim
t→∞
provided the limit exists and there is a d > 0 such that
p(t) has for all t ≥ 0 a distance > d from ∂M . By con-
struction, ωM,x is invariant under not too large pertur-
bations of {xt} and M . We are now ready to formulate:
Theorem 1: Let S0(ω) ≥ 0 (ω ∈ [−π, π]) be a sym-
metric, continuous function, 0 < ω0 < π and ǫ > 0. Then
there is a time series {yt}, an embedding dimension N
and a counter M ⊂ RN such that ωM,y = ω0 and

for all integer t. Convergence of the left hand side of
Eq. (8) guarantees that such an L exists. {ut} is an ap-
proximation of {xt} reconstructed from {yt} using the
ﬁlter (9). Since the approximation error of the time se-
ries is at most d/2, so is, in the maximum norm, the
approximation error of the trajectories.
In particular,
the topological relation between the trajectory and the
counter M is not changed by going over from {xt} to {ut}
(except for some pairs of forward/backward transitions
through M , which do not contribute to the limit (4)).
Hence, ωM,u = ωM,x.

Now, notice that the N -dimensional delay embedding

|Sy(ω) − S0(ω)| < ǫ

for all ω ∈ [−π, π],

(5)

of {ut} can be obtained by a linear projection

where Sy(ω) is the power spectral density of {yt}.

As a ﬁrst step in proving Theorem 1, notice that for
any bounded time series {xt} the topological frequency
is invariant under nearly arbitrary linear, ﬁltering:

Lemma 1: Let {yt} be obtained from a bounded time

series {xt} by linear causal ﬁltering,

for all complex z, r−1 < |z| < r. (This excludes, for ex-
ample, ﬁlters which fully block some frequencies.) Then,
provided ωM,x is deﬁned, there is, at suﬃciently high
embedding dimension, a counter M ′ such that ωM ′,y is
deﬁned and ωM ′,y = ωM,x.

This is most easily seen by the following explicit con-
struction of an appropriate M ′: Notice that the ﬁlter

from the 2L + N -dimensional delay embedding of {yt}
[5, 6], with the matrix elements of P given by Eq. (9).
Furthermore, P maps the trajectory of {yt+L} onto the
trajectory of {ut}. Deﬁne the oriented manifold M ′ such
that

v ∈ M ′ ⇔ Pv ∈ M,

(v ∈ R2L+N )

(12)

and ∂M = P∂M ′ in the obvious way. This guarantees
a ﬁnite distance of the trajectory of {yt} from ∂M ′, and
there is a one-to-one correspondence between transitions
of the trajectory of {ut} through M and transitions of the
trajectory of {yt} through M ′. Hence, ωM ′,y = ωM,u =
ωM,x, proving Lemma 1.

Now, in order to obtain {yt} as described in Theorem 1,
take a time series {xt} which oscillates with frequency ω0
and adjust the spectral density by ﬁltering. A suitable
time series to start with is given by

xt = 2 cos(i ω0 t + i φt),

(13)

(8)

where φ0 = 0, φt+1 = φt +ϑ ǫt, and {ǫt} is an equally dis-
tributed random sequence of the values −1 and 1. With
the counter M given by Eq. (3), the topological frequency
ωM,x = ω0 is deﬁned when

In order

(k = 1, . . . , p), and all other ak = 0, {yt} given by
Eq. (6) has the spectral density Sy(ω) = |a(e−iω)|2Sx(ω)
(see, e.g., Ref. [7], Theorem 4.4.1) and inequality (17) im-
plies (5). By (16) the ﬁlter {ak} satisﬁes the invertability
condition (7) of Lemma 1. Thus, an appropriate counter
M can be obtained such that ωM,y = f and Theorem 1
is proven.
It should be mentioned that when S0(ω) is
analytic for real ω, Theorem 1 generally holds also with
perfect identity Sy(ω) = S0(ω) instead of inequality (5).
There are two assumptions upon which Lemma 1 is
based – the boundedness of {xt} and the ﬁnite distance
of its trajectory from ∂M – which are not perfectly sat-
isﬁed by typical noisy processes. Rather, the probability
of reaching some point in delay space decreases exponen-
tially (or faster) with the distance from some “average”
trajectory and the inverse noise strength. For many pro-
cesses the two assumptions and, as a consequence, the in-
variance of the ωcount under ﬁltering hold therefore only
up to an exponentially small error. For signals gener-
ated by noisy, weakly nonlinear oscillators, an analytic
estimate of this error shall now be derived.

Due to the separation of time scales inherent in the
weakly nonlinear limit, it is more appropriate to work
in a continuous-time representation. Consider the noisy,
weakly-nonlinear oscillator described by a complex am-
plitude A(t) with dynamics given by the noisy Landau-
Stuart equation [8]

˙A = (ǫ + iω0)A − (1 + igi)|A|2A + η(t),

(18)

where ǫ, ω0, and gi are real and η(t) denotes complex,
white noise with correlations

hη(t)η(t′)i = 0,

hη(t)η(t′)∗i = 4δ(t − t′)

(19)

[∗ ≡ complex conjugation, h·i ≡ expectation value]. In
a certain sense, this system universally describes noisy
oscillations in the vicinity of a Hopf bifurcation [9].

Notice that in general (i.e., with gi 6= 0) the linear fre-
quency ω0, the spectral peak frequency ωpeak, the average
frequency or phase frequency

ωph,A := hωii , ωi := Im { ˙A/A}

are all diﬀerent; see Fig. 1. [Deﬁnitions (20,21) are some-
times restricted to “analytic signals” (SA(ω) = 0 for
ω < 0) derived from the corresponding real-valued signals
Re{A(t)}. See Ref. [10] for the history.]

The phase frequency measures the average number of
circulations around the point A = 0 in phase space per
unit time (decompose A(t) = a(t)eiφ(t) to see this). It is a
period-counting frequency and the quantity which comes
conceptually closest to the topological frequency. How-
ever, the choice of the point A = 0 can here be justiﬁed
only by symmetry and dynamics [the invariant density
pertaining to Eq. (18) has an extremum at A = 0], and
not by invariance under perturbations. ωpeak and ωmean
are both spectral frequency measures, and the inﬂuence
of ﬁltering is obvious. But how does ﬁltering aﬀect ωph,A?
The dynamics of A on short time scales δt is dominated
by the driving noise, and the change in A is of the order
|δA| = O(4δt)1/2. A band-pass ﬁlter of spectral width
∆ω which truncates the tails of the peak corresponding
to A in the power spectrum suppresses this diﬀusive mo-
tion on time scales ∆ω−1, while on longer time scales
dynamics change only little. The corresponding defor-

TABLE I: The shift δωnum in the phase frequency ωph,A of
A(t), obtained from simulations of Eqs. (18,19) with gi =
1, after ﬁltering as in Eq. (23), and a comparison with the
theoretical estimate Eq. (29). The data verify δω ∼ ǫ−1
1 ,
∼ (ω1 − ω0), and ∼ N −1 in this order.

mation of the path of A in the complex plane can alter
the number of circulations of the origin whenever A ap-
proaches the origin to less then ≈ (4/∆ω)1/2. At these
times |A| is small and, for not too narrow ﬁlters, the
dynamics of A in its linear range. Thus, the eﬀect of
broad-band ﬁltering can be estimated by a linear theory!
Consider for a moment the linearized version of Eq. (18),

˙A = (ǫ + iω0)A + η(t),

(22)

with η(t) as above, and assume ǫ < 0. Clearly, ωph,A =
ω0. For the phase frequency of a complex, Gaussian,
linear process B(t) in general, a simple calculation shows
ωph,B = ωmean,B. This can be used to calculate the phase
frequencies of A after ﬁltering. Let, for example, B be
obtained from A through the primitive band-pass ﬁlter

˙B = (−ǫ1 + iω1)B + A,

(23)

which is centered at ω1 with width ǫ1 > 0. Using ωph,B =
ωmean,B and elementary ﬁlter theory [12] one obtains

ωph,B =

ǫ1 ω0 − ǫ ω1
ǫ1 − ǫ

.

(24)

By the argument given above, the shift in phase fre-
1 ) is
∼ 4/ǫ1. Since A has a com-
|A|2
= −1/ǫ,

quency δω := ωph,B −ωph,A = (ω0 −ω1) (ǫ/ǫ1)+O(ǫ−2
due to the times where |A|2 <

Now assume that,

instead of A(t), only a real-
valued signal x(t) = Re{A(t) + (higher harmonics)} +
(perturbations) is given. The natural way to estimate
the phase frequency of A(t) then is to construct an ap-
proximation ˆA(t) = (f ∗ x)(t) of A(t) by convolution of
x(t) with a complex-valued ﬁlter f (t), and to estimate the
phase frequency as ˆωph,A = ωph, ˆA. f (t) describes 2D de-
lay embedding or analytic-signal construction and ﬁlter-
ing to eliminate higher harmonics, oﬀsets, aliasing, and
external perturbations. The result above shows that gen-
erally, for ˆωph,A to be unbiased, the total eﬀect of all these
transformations should be a complex, symmetric band-
pass centered on the linear frequency ω0 (6= ωph, ωpeak!).
When the spectral density is of genuine interest, for-
get period counting. But there are many real-world ap-
plications where neither the characteristics of the signal
pathway nor a detailed model of the oscillator are known,
and yet a robust measure of the frequency or, at least,
some robust characterization of the oscillator is sought.
Then, by Theorem 1, spectral methods miss valuable in-
formation. In view of Lemma 1 and Eq. (29), concepts
such as topological frequency or its little brother, phase
frequency, are more appropriate. The fractal dimension
of the reconstructed attractors, an alternative character-
ization, is typically robust with respect to ﬁnite-impulse-
response ﬁltering [14] only [5, 6].

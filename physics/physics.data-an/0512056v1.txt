As it follows from the interrelation of Gamma and Poisson distributions 1, 2 the observed value of asymmetry for
Poisson ﬂows of events has the bias. The Monte Carlo experiment conﬁrms the presence of this bias between the
observed and initial asymmetries. The obtained results allow to correct the estimation of the asymmetry of ﬂow rates.

1. Introduction

In the report the usage of the properties of the sta-
tistically dual distributions 3 (Poisson and Gamma)
as well as the concept the “conﬁdence density of pa-
rameter” 4 allows us to show the presence of a bias in
reconstruction of the initial asymmetry, which pro-
duced the observed asymmetry. We use here the con-
ﬁdence density as a posteriori density with assump-
tion that we have uniform prior.

2. The modeling of the asymmetry

Under the initial asymmetry we keep in mind the
diﬀerence between the relative mean numbers of
µ2
) of two diﬀerent ﬂows
events (
µ1 + µ2

µ1
µ1 + µ2

and

of events:

A =

µ1 − µ2
µ1 + µ2

.

µ in the case of a single observation n is the Gamma
distribution Γ1,1+n with mean, mode, and variance
n + 1, n, and n + 1 respectively. This statement was
checked by the Monte Carlo experiment 6.

The diﬀerence between the most probable and
mean values of the parameter of the Poisson distri-
bution suggests that there takes place (in the case of
the measurement of asymmetry) a deviation which
can be approximately estimated by the expression

ˆAcor =

(n1 + 1) − (n2 + 1)
(n1 + 1) + (n2 + 1)

= ˆA ·

where values n1 and n2 are the observed numbers of
events from two Poisson distributions with parame-
ters µ1 and µ2 correspondingly.

We carried out the uniform scanning of parame-
ter A, varying A from value A = −1 to value A = 1
using step size 0.01. By playing with the two Poisson
distributions (with parameters µ1 and µ2) and using
30000 trials for each value of A we used the RNPSSN
function 7 to construct the conditional distribution
of the probability of the production of the observed
value of asymmetry ˆA by the initial asymmetry A.
We assume that an integral luminosity is a constant
µ1 + µ2 = const. The parameters µ1 and µ2 are cho-
sen in accordance with the given initial asymmetry
A.

In Fig.1 (left) the distribution of ˆA for given val-
ues of µ1 + µ2 = 100 and A = 0.5 is shown. The

µ2 = 100) (left). The distribution of observed asymmetry ˆA

distribution of the observed asymmetry ˆA versus the
initial asymmetry A (Fig.1, right) shows the result
of the full scanning. The distribution of the prob-
ability of the initial asymmetries A to produce the
observed value of ˆA = 1 in case of µ1 + µ2 = 10 is
presented in Fig.2 (left). This ﬁgure clearly shows
the diﬀerence between the most probable value of
the initial asymmetry (A=1) and the mean value of
the initial asymmetry (A=0.76). As seen in Fig.2
(right), the r.m.s. (root-mean-square) of the distri-
bution of the initial asymmetry A is dependent on
the observed value of asymmetry ˆA. This distribu-
tion characterizes the resolution of the determination
of A by the observed value ˆA. The dependence of the
initial asymmetry A on the observed asymmetry ˆA
for µ1 + µ2 = 60 can be seen in Fig.3. The deviation
from the straight line is essentially dependent on the
integral luminosity.

3. Conclusions

The Monte Carlo experiment conﬁrms the presence
of the bias between the mean value of the initial
asymmetry and the observed asymmetry. The con-

served asymmetry ˆA (µ1 + µ2 = 60).

ditional distribution of the probability of the initial
asymmetry A to give the observed value ˆA has an
asymmetric shape for large values of ˆA. The resolu-
tion of the determination of the initial asymmetry A
by the observed value ˆA is dependent on the value
of the observed asymmetry. We propose a simple
formula Eq. (3) for correction of the observed asym-
metry. The correct account for the uncertainty of
the observed value must use the distribution of the
initial asymmetry, i.e. the reconstructed conﬁdence
density of the parameter A (see, Fig.2, left).

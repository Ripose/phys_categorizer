Abstract

Evidence of discrete scale invariance (DSI) in daytime healthy heart
rate variability (HRV) is presented based on the log-periodic power law
scaling of the heart beat interval increment. Our analysis suggests mul-
tiple DSI groups and a dynamic cascading process. A cascade model is
presented to simulate such a property.

1 Introduction

The phenomenon of heart rate variability (HRV) in humans desrcibes the beat-

to-beat, apparently random, ﬂuctuation of the heart rate1. HRV measured

by the time span between ventricular contractions, known as the beat-to-beat

RR interval (RRi), is also known to share many characteristics found in other

natural phenomena. For example, daytime RRi in healthy humans exhibits 1/f-

like power spectrum2, multifractal scaling3,4, and similar increment distribution

observed in ﬂuid turbulence4. These characteristics may vary signiﬁcantly in

heart disease patients depending on the severity of the disease1,5.

The origin and the generation of HRV remain the biggest challenges in the

contemporary HRV research. Although the respiratory and vascular systems

constantly modulate the heart rate, they do not explain the large percentage of

1

the broad-band (multifractal) signal power in HRV. For example, it is unlikely

that this broad-band feature results directly from the output of the narrow-band

respiratory dynamics6. Also, it is known that the level and the variability of

blood pressure and heart rate can change signiﬁcantly from upright to supine

positions. In a 42-day long bed rest test, Fortrat et al. showed that the variation

in blood pressure and heart before and after the test are qualitatively diﬀerent,

suggesting separate control mechanisms for generating their variability7. It is

thus believed that a more sophisticated structure may exist, which integrates

the feedback from receptors to create the pattern of HRV8.

Apart from its origin, some progess on the HRV generating mechanism may

be possible by using the discrete (lattice) multiplicative cascade model4. This

is purely a phenomenology approach that does not prescribe to any physiology

term. Nontheless, encouraging results were obtained that are consistent with

the physiological data in health and in certain heart disease4. The main pur-

pose of this work is to investigate the basis of this modeling strategy. Our

approach is based on the scale invariant symmetry implied from the HRV

phenomenology4,9,10. Since RRi cannot be deﬁned between heart beats, it is

appropriate to consider discrete scale invariance (DSI) in HRV. It is known that

discrete cascade implies DSI11∼15. Better characterization of DSI in HRV is

thus important since it is the necessary condition for the multifractal scaling

observed in HRV. The existence of cascade is also signiﬁcant because it rep-

resents a very diﬀerent approach of the cardiovascular dynamical system from

feedback control that is additive in principle. The idea will support the previous

studies that a direct inﬂuence from baroreﬂex to multifractal HRV is unlikely7,

as well as the need to search for a role by the higher control centers in HRV8.

The consequence of DSI is an oscillating scaling law with a well-deﬁned

power law period. Such a scaling law is said to exhibit log-periodicity (LP).

In this work, we analyzed DSI in daytime healthy HRV by searching LP in

2

the scaling of HRV. Typically, LP is “averaged out” in the process of ﬁnding

the scaling law. Using the technique called “rephasing,” this problem can be

eﬀectively resolved and evidence of multiple DSI groups in the healthy daytime

RRi data was found. In light of this new result, a cascade model is constructed

using random branching law to reproduce not only some ofthe known HRV

phenomenology, but also the multiple DSI characteristics.

The results of this work are organized in ﬁve sections. In Section 2, a brief

review of the notion of DSI is given. The numerical procedures for identifying the

DSI property from time series are described in Section 3. Numerical examples

and results on daytime heart rate data sets are given in Section 4. Concluding

remarks are given in the last Section.

2 Discrete Scale Invariance and Rephasing

2.1 Ideas of Discrete Scale Invariance in Physical Systems

A random processes x(t) is said to possess continuous scale invariant symmetry13

if its distribution is preserved after the change of variables, t → λt, x → x/µ

where λ and µ(λ) are real numbers; i.e.,

x(t) =

x(λt).

1
µ

(1)

DSI is deﬁned when (1) only holds for a countable set of scale factors λ1, λ2, · · ·.

Scale invariance implies power law. The power law in DSI has a log-periodic

correction of frequency 1/ log(λ):

i.e., x(t) = tγF (log(t)/ log(λ)) where γ =

log µ/ log λ and F (x) = F (x + 1). Generally15, one can consider x(t) = Cttγ
,
Ct being t-dependent, and γ′ = γ + 2πni/ log(λ) is a complex number for n =

′

1, 2, · · ·. Novikov suggested LP in the small scale energy cascade of the turbulent

ﬂow14. Sornette and co-workers showed that LP exists more generally in physical

and ﬁnancial systems, such as turbulence15, earthquake16, rupture17 and stock

market crashes18.

3

The existence of the discrete scale factor implies a hierarchical structure.

This link can be simply illustrated by the middle third Cantor set with the

scale factor λ = 3. With proper rescaling, a precise copy of the set is only

obtained with a 3-fold maniﬁcation of the scale13. If x(t) denotes the Lebesgue

measure at scale t, the Cantor set can be modeled by (1) using λ = 3 and

µ = λ− log(2)/ log(3). Thus, the power law exponent of x(t) (the box dimension of

the Cantor set19) assumes a log-periodic oscillation of frequency 1/ log(3) about

its mean value log(2)/ log(3).

The hierarchical structure can be a dynamic object as a result of some time-

dependent branching law. Such a dynamic hierarchy is believed to exist, for

example, in the cascade paradigm of the energy exchange in ﬂuid turbulence

where the break-down or “branching” of large-scale vortices into ones of smaller

scales can occur randomly in space-time with the energy re-distribution fol-

lowing a multiplication scheme. In data analysis, the dynamic hierarchy poses

a technical diﬃculty for ﬁnding the scale factor λ since LP may be averaged

out in the process of obtaining the power law. Zhou and Sornette proposed to

conduct averaging after rephasing or re-aligning data segments using a central

maximum criterion15. Using this technique, these authors successfully extracted

LP in turbulence and proposed the DSI symmetry and cascade. The rephasing

technique is adopted in this work. Instead of the central maximum criterion,

the cross-correlation property of the data segments will be used (see step (d)

below).

2.2 Rephasing RRi Data

Let r(t) denote the RRi between the tth and (t + 1)th heart beats. Based on

the turbulence analogy of HRV4, we focus on the LP in the scaling exponent of

the empirical law S(τ, p) = h|∆r(τ )|pi ∼ τ ζ(τ,p) where ∆r(τ ) = r(t + τ ) − r(t)

and p is a real number. The implementation of the rephasing follows a 8-step

4

algorithm; see Fig. 1.

(a) Divide r(t) into M nonoverlapping segments {R1, · · · , RM }.

(b) For r(t) ∈ Ri, calculate Si(τ, p) = h|∆r(τ )|pi.

(c) Apply a low-pass (K, L) Savitzky-Golay (SG) ﬁlter8 to Si(τ, p) and calculate

its ﬁrst derivative to obtain a τ -dependent ζi(τ, p) for i = 1, · · · , M . The (K, L)

SG ﬁlter performs a K th order polynomial ﬁt over L samples15. It can produce a

smoothing eﬀect in the high frequency while preserving the statistical moments

of the signal up to the order of the ﬁlter.

(d) Randomly select the ith segment as the base segment and compute the

cross-correlation CK,L

(e) Shift the time origin of ζj(τ, p) by ∆j, where max(CK,L

i,j (κ) between ζi(τ, p) and ζj (τ + κ, p) for j 6= i.
i,j ) = CK,L

i,j (−∆j), so

that the cross-correlation between ζi(τ ), p and the shifted ζj(∆j + τ, p) has a

maximum at zero time lag. Note that ∆i = 0 for the base segment.

(f) Average the shifted ζj(τ + ∆j, p), j = 1, · · · , M , to obtain ZK,L(τ, p).

(g) Compute the spectrum of ZK,L(τ, p).

(h) Return to (c) with diﬀerent K, L values.

A Lomb periodogram20 L(f ) is used to estimate the spectrum of ZK,L(τ, p) for

its superiority in handling situations where noise plays a fundamental role in

the signal, as well as its capability in handling small data set.

Although the above algorithm provides the systematic steps to estimate the

log-periodic component, noise in the empirical data can also generate spurious

peaks in the Lomb periodogram. For independent Gaussian noise process, this

problem can be analyzed by the false alarm probability20,21:

PG(f ) = 1 − (1 − exp(−L(f )))m

(2)

where m is proportional to the number of points in the spectrum. The smaller

the value PG(f ) is, the more likely a genuine log-periodic component exists in

5

the signal. Thus, a Lomb peak with large PG(f ) suggests a chance event. Zhou

and Sornette conducted extensive simulations and showed that (2) is in fact an

upper bound for a number of correlated noise except for those showing long-

term persistent correlation21. The fractional Brownian motion (fBm) of a Hurst

exponent greater than 0.5 is an example where (2) does not apply. The multiple

scaling exponents in healthy daytime HRV have been found to lie below such a

threshold1,3,4,9 and we will continue to use (2) in this work.

As shown above, DSI is characterized by the frequency 1/ log(λ) of the

LP. However, signiﬁcant Lomb peaks may only capture the higher harmonics

k/ log(λ), k 6= 1. It is therefore necessary to deﬁne the relation of the signiﬁcant

peaks. We propose a simple procedure to achieve this. First, we collect the
signiﬁcant peaks satisfying PG ≤ P ∗
G for P ∗

G ≪ 1 and for diﬀerent SG ﬁlter

parameters. Second, we form a signiﬁcant Lomb peak histogram (SLPH) and

locate its local maxima. These maxima identiﬁes the most probable frequencies

of the log-periodic oscillation of the power law. Let such maxima be f1, · · · , fn.

The last step of the procedure is to search the smallest λ to minimize

dλ =

|fi − ki/ log(λ)|

(3)

n

X
i

for integers ki’s. We seek the smallest λ since, with ﬁnite precision in numerical

computing, dλ can be made arbitrarily small as λ ≫ 1 This minimization step

is simple, easy to implement and, as we show below using synthetic data, it is

also eﬀective.

3 Numerical Results

3.1 DSI in Discrete Bounded Cascade

The rephasing algorithm introduced above was ﬁrst tested on synthetic data

generated by the discrete cascade4

xJ (t) = ΠJ

j ωj(t)

(4)

6

where the cascade components ωj(t) are discrete-time processes given by

for t(j)

k ≤ t < t(j)

k+1, k = 1, 2, · · ·, j = 1, · · · , J, and w is a zero-mean Gaussian

random variable of variance 1. Let t(j)

k+1 − t(j)

k = δj. The scale factor λ in the

DSI hierarchy is related to t(j)

k ’s by

ωj(t) = 1 + σjw

δj/δj+1 = λ.

(5)

(6)

To model the bounded RRi, we further assume σj > σj+1 to assure bounded-

ness. This model has been used in the past to simulate HRV phenomenology,

including transition of RRi increment probability density function and multi-

fractal scaling4.

According to (4), we generated 30 sets of dyadic (λ = 2) and triadic (λ = 3)

xJ (t) with the corresponding log(σj ) = (−1.6 − 0.126j) log(2) and log(σj) =

(−1.9 − 0.093j) log(3), respectively. Each xJ (t) has 8192 points and is divided

into segments of 1024 points. Twenty-four sets of (K, L) SG ﬁlter are deﬁned

based on K = 3, 4, · · · , 7, L = 7, 9, · · · , 15. For each combination of K, L, steps

(c) to (h) in the rephasing algorithm is repeated six times based on six diﬀerent

base segments selected in step (d) of the algorithm. This is implemented to

avoid bias from a particular segment. Signiﬁcant Lomb peaks are collected

based on the false alarm probability P ∗

G < 1% or L(f ) ≥ 10 and m = 256 points

of the Lomb periodogram. The results for p = 2 is reported as no quantitative

diﬀerence exists for p ≤ 3. Numerical results for p > 3 show more variability

due to poor statistics.

FIG. 2a shows the ζi(τ, p) of a particular segment of one of the dyadic xJ (t)’s.

The log-periodic oscillation with a log-period log(2) is clearly seen. The Lomb

periodogram of ZK,L(τ, p) (step (f) above) is shown in FIG. 2b based on a

particular choice of K, L and the dominant LP is seen to pick up the second

7

harmonics of 1/ log(2). The SLPH estimated for diﬀerent SG ﬁlters over 30 sets

of xJ (t) is obtained in FIG. 3. The clustering of the local maxima at integer

multiples of 1/ log(2) is evident. The minimization (3) identiﬁes the correct

scale factor λ = 2 for the dyadic cascade. Similar results of the tradic cascade

are also found (FIG. 3). These examples demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the

proposed numerical procedures.

3.2 DSI in Daytime Healthy HRV

For HRV, two databases are considered. The ﬁrst set (DB1) consists of 10

ambulatory RRi recordings from healthy young adults4. These test subjects

were allowed to conduct normal daily activities. The second set (DB2), available

from the public domain22, consists of 18 ambulatory RRi recordings showing

normal sinus rhythm. The parameters used in the numerical analysis are the

same as above except the data segment length has increased to 2048 points. The

choice of the segment length is a balance of two factors: small segment length

results in more segments but poorer statistics in the estimation of ζi(τ, p); large

segment length results in less segments but better estimate of ζi(τ, p). We tried

1024 points per segment and found similar results; i.e., the group averaged λ

value is similar to the ones reported in FIG. 5 below.

The SLPH in all cases shows well positioned local maxima that can be easily

related to the harmonics of some fundamental frequency (FIG. 4). The λ values

for DB1 and DB2 are summarized in FIG. 5. It is observed that (a) there are

non-integer scale factor λ and (b) the λ’s cluster in the range of [3.5, 5.5] and

the group averaged λ are ∼4.8 and ∼4.4 for DB1 and DB2, respectively. The

noninteger λ unambiguously excludes the possibility of discrete cascades with

one scale factor. It implies more complicated branching law and multiple DSI

groups in healthy HRV.

Although HRV and turbulence exhibit similar phenomenology4, it is inter-

8

esting to point out the rather large λ value (> 4) compared with the λ ∼ 2 in

ﬂuid turbulence10. From the discrete cascade viewpoint, a larger λ is compati-

ble with the “patchiness” appearance commonly observed in the RRi of healthy

humans1,3,4,9,10 since the ωj(t)’s of the cascade will ﬂuctuate on a longer time

scale to create the eﬀect.

To model the multiple DSI in cascade HRV, the scale factor λ used in (5)

is set to be a random number so that the log-periodic oscillation of ζ(p) can

vary over a range of frequencies. We generated 30 sets of xJ (t) according to (4)

using uniformly distributed λ in the interval [2,6]. The simulated xJ (t) exhibits

the “patchiness” pattern observed in the RRi data (FIG. 6), and similar scaling

characteristics found in the past4 (FIGs. 7a ∼ 7c). The scaling exponent ζ(τ, p)

of the power law h|∆xJ (τ )|pi ∼ τ ζ(τ,p) exhibits log-periodic oscillation that

is captured by the well positioned local maxima in SLPH (FIGs. 7d, 7e). In

addition, the average of the λ’s lies close to the group-averaged λ values of DB1

and DB2 (FIG. 5).

4 Conclusion

It is known that discrete cascade leads to DSI and characterized by log-periodic

modulation of the scaling property11,12. Hence, the LP reported in this work

supports the view of a cascade for the multifractal generation in HRV. It implies

a more sophisticated process than reﬂex-based control mechanisms that function

on the additive basis. It also suggests the need to search for a role by the higher

control centers in HRV8. It is conjectured that the cascade describes the process

which integrates the regulatory feedbacks in the cardiovascular system to create

the pattern of HRV.

The non-integer scale factor implies multiple DSI. This property was also

reported in the screening competition of the growth of diﬀusion limited aggre-

9

gation model23,24. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst instance of

multiple DSI being reported in HRV. We do not have the better knowledge of

its origin, except to believe it reﬂects the multiple time-scale control mechanisms

in the cardiovascular dynamical system.

It is tempting to search for the physiological correlate of the cascade, for ex-

ample, the role of the cascade components ωj(t). Based on the spectral analysis,

we suggested that the large time scale components (ωj, j ∼ 1) capture mainly

the sympatho-vagal interaction and the small time scale components (ωj, j ≫ 1)

capture the parasympathetic activity4. However, we should caution that cas-

cade is a modeling tool derived from statistical physics. The ωj(t) can therefore

represent the range of micro- to macroscopic processes in the cardiovascular

dynamical system.

A rather narrow range of the scale factor λ ∈ [3.5, 5.5] estimated from the

two diﬀerent databases implies a “stable” hierarchical structure of the cascade

that does not vary sensitively with the details of the healthy population. The

analysis of the identiﬁed DSI characteristics in other physiological conditions is

currently underway and its result will be reported in the near future.

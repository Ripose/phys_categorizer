Abstract

We compare two diﬀerent deﬁnitions for the wavelet entropy associated to stochastic
processes. The ﬁrst one, the Normalized Total Wavelet Entropy (NTWS) family
[Phys. Rev. E 57 (1998) 932; J. Neuroscience Method 105 (2001) 65; Physica A
(2005) in press] and a second introduced by Tavares and Lucena [Physica A 357
(2005) 71]. In order to understand their advantages and disadvantages, exact results
obtained for fractional Gaussian noise (−1 < α < 1) and the fractional Brownian
motion (1 < α < 3) are assessed. We ﬁnd out that NTWS family performs better
as a characterization method for these stochastic processes.

1 Introduction

The advantages of projecting an arbitrary continuous stochastic process in
a discrete wavelet space are widely known. The wavelet time-frequency rep-
resentation does not make any assumptions about signal stationarity and is
capable of detecting dynamic changes due to its localization properties [1, 2].
Unlike the harmonic base functions of the Fourier analysis, which are precisely
localized in frequency but inﬁnitely extend in time, wavelets are well local-
ized in both time and frequency. Moreover, the computational time is signiﬁ-
cantly shorter since the algorithm involves the use of fast wavelet transform in
a multiresolution framework [1]. Finally, contaminating noises’ contributions
can be easily eliminated when they are concentrated in some frequency bands.
These important reasons justify the introduction, within this special space, of
entropy-based algorithms in order to quantify the degree of order-disorder as-
sociated with a multi-frequency signal response. With the entropy estimated
via the wavelet transform, the time evolution of frequency patterns can be
followed with an optimal time-frequency resolution. In this paper we focus
on two deﬁnitions for this quantiﬁer: the Normalized Total Wavelet Entropy
(NTWS) family introduced recently by us [3, 4, 5, 6], and another deﬁnition
given by Tavares and Lucena [7]. We compare their performance while charac-
terizing two important stochastic processes: the fractional Brownian motion
(fBm) and the fractional Gaussian noise (fGn). In particular, we will show
that the NTWS family gives a better characterization for both of them.

2 Wavelet quantiﬁers

2.1 Wavelet energies

The Wavelet Analysis is one of the most useful tools when dealing with data
samples. Any signal can be decomposed by using a wavelet dyadic discrete
family {2j/2ψ(2jt − k)}, with j, k ∈ Z (the set of integers)—an orthonormal
basis for L2(R) consisting of ﬁnite-energy signals—of translations and scaling
functions based on a function ψ: the mother wavelet [1, 2]. In the following,
given a stochastic process s(t) its associated signal is assumed to be given
by the sampled values S = {s(n), n = 1, · · · , M}. Its wavelet expansion has
associated wavelet coeﬃcients given by

Cj(k) = hS, 2j/2ψ(2j · −k)i,

(1)

with j = −N, · · · , −1, and N = log2 M. The number of coeﬃcients at each
resolution level is Nj = 2jM. Note that this correlation gives information on

2

the signal at scale 2−j and time 2−jk. The set of wavelet coeﬃcients at level
j, {Cj(k)}k, is also a stochastic process where k represents the discrete time
variable. It provides a direct estimation of local energies at diﬀerent scales.
Inspired by the Fourier analysis we deﬁne the energy at resolution level j by

where E stands for the average using some, at ﬁrst, unknown probability
distribution. In the case the set {Cj(k)}k is proved to be a stationary process
the previous equation reads

Ej =

E |Cj(k)|2 ,

Xk

Ej = NjE |Cj(k)|2 .

Observe that the energy Ej is only a function of the resolution level. Also,
under the same assumptions, the temporal average energy at level j is given
by

1
Nj

Ej =

e

Xk

E |Cj(k)|2 = E |Cj(k)|2 ,

where we have used eq. (3) to arrive to the last step in this equation. Since we
are using dyadic discrete wavelets the number of coeﬃcients decreases over the
low frequency bands (at resolution level j the number is halved with respect
to the previous one j + 1); thus, the latter energy deﬁnition reinforce the
contribution of these low frequency bands.

Summing over all the available wavelets levels j we obtain the corresponding
total energies: Etotal =
Ej. Finally, we deﬁne the
relative wavelet energy

j=−N Ej and

Etotal =

and the relative temporal average wavelet energy

Both supply information about the relative energy associated with the diﬀerent
frequency bands. So, they enable us to learn about their corresponding degree
pj = 1; both deﬁne probability
of importance. Clearly,
distributions: {pj} and {
pj}—they can also be considered as time-scale energy

2.2 Normalized Total Wavelet Entropy family

The Shannon entropy [8] provides a measure of the information of any dis-
tribution. Consequently, we have previously deﬁned the family of Normalized

with Smax = log2 N. It has been adopted the base-2 logarithm for the entropy
deﬁnition to take advantage of the dyadic nature of the wavelet expansion;
thus, simplifying the entropy formulae that will be used in this work.

2.3 Tavares-Lucena Wavelet Entropy

Alternatively, Tavares and Lucena, following the basis entropy cost concept [1],
have recently [7] deﬁned another probability distribution:

pjk = E |Cj(k)|2 /E (TL)

tot

and pφ = E |hS, φi|2 /E (TL)

tot

,

(9)

where φ is the scaling function having the properties of a smoothing kernel (see
reference [7] for details), and E (TL)
E |Cj(k)|2 + E |hS, φi|2. Therefore,
they propose the following entropy

S(TL)
max ,

(10)

with S(TL)
max = log2(2N − 1). As a matter of comparison we have normalized
this expression and it will be referred as Tavares-Lucena Wavelet Entropy
(TLWS).

It should be noted that in eqs. (7), (8), and (10) the maximum resolution
level N is an experimental parameter. It appears explicitly as a direct conse-
quence of sampling. Tavares and Lucena underlined this fact because it is not
mentioned in previous approaches.

3 Theoretical results and comparison

The aim of this paper is to study the performance of the wavelet entropy def-
initions previously given. So we analyze two well known stochastic processes,
namely, the fBm and the fGn [9, 10]. The energy per resolution level j and

4

sampled time k has been already evaluated for the fBm [5, 11, 12]. But it can
be extended to fGn—see the Appendix. The ﬁnal form reads

where −1 < α < 3—by continuity we have added α = 1 but it does not belong
to any existent process. It should be noted that the latter is independent of
k. In the following we will use this power-law behavior with diﬀerent ranges
for α, for the two stochastic processes under analysis, gathering both into a
uniﬁed framework. According to its values, the coeﬃcient α must be attached
to one of the two mentioned processes.

In order to calculate the NTWS family, the relative wavelet energy for a ﬁnite
data sample is obtained from eqs. (5) and (11)

Similarly, the relative temporal average wavelet energy—see eqs. (6) and (11)—
gives

pj = 2−(j+1)(α−1) 1 − 2α−1

1 − 2N (α−1) .

pj = 2−(j+1)α 1 − 2α
1 − 2N α .

(13)

Consequently, the normalized total wavelet entropies can be easily obtained
from eqs. (7) and (8),

For the Tavares and Lucena’s approach similar steps should be followed. From
the power-law behavior mentioned before a straightforward calculation yields

pjk = 2−jα 1 − 2α+1

1 − 2N (α+1) .

(16)

Therefore, the TLWS is obtained replacing the above into eq. (10),

(17)

The NTWS family and the TLWS, as a function of α and N, are depicted in
Figs. 1 to 3. One point to emphasize from these graphs when α > 0 is that the
NTWS’s range of variation increases smoothly with N, improving detection;
on the opposite, the TLWS’s range decreases when N increases. All entropies
equally improve with N on the −1 < α < 0 branch. Moreover, for any N the
NTWS family covers almost all the available range between 0 and 1, while the
TLWS roughly covers a 25% of this range.

It is of common understanding that high entropy values are associated to a
signal generated by a totally disordered random process, and low values to an
ordered or partially ordered process. If the process is noisy, its signal wavelet
decomposition is expected to have signiﬁcant contributions to the total wavelet
energy coming from all frequency bands. Moreover, one could expect that all
the contributions being of the same order. Consequently, its relative energies
will be almost equal at all resolution levels and acquire the entropy maximum
value. While a nearly ordered process will have a relative energy contribution
concentrated around some level j, thus its entropy will take a low value. The
SW, depicted in Fig. 2.
only entropy in concordance with this intuitive vision is

In Fig. 4 we compare the two entropy formulations as functions of the α-
parameter when N = 12. It is clear that the
W entropies attain
their maxima at α = 0 (white noise), and the SW entropy reaches it when
α → 1. There are two diﬀerent regions to examine:

SW and S(TL)

e

e

• fractional Brownian motion, 1 < α < 3:

All the three quantiﬁers have their maximum at α = 1, and monotonically
decrease to ﬁnd their minimum in a near regular process, α → 3. The range
of variation of the TLWS is ∆S(TL)
W = 0.038, and the range of variation of the
SW = 0.384 and ∆SW = 0.698. Clearly, due to the small
NTWS family is ∆
range of variation, the TLWS is unﬁt to diﬀerentiate between the short- and
long-memory fBm family members, 1 < α < 2 and 2 < α < 3 respectively.
The NTWS family seems to be the best tool for this diﬀerentiation, and the
SW has the best performance in this interval.

e

• fractional Gaussian noise, −1 < α < 1:

The TLWS seems inadequate to describe this range—note that S(TL)
S(TL)
W (12, 3). The SW is the best suited to describe these noises, since it is

W (12, −1) <

monotonically decreasing and presents a range of variation ∆SW = 0.698.
SW confuses between noises coming from short- or long-memory
While the
processes, −1 < α < 0 and 0 < α < 1 respectively. It has its maximum at
α = 0 (white noise).

4 Conclusions

We have introduced exact theoretical expressions for the wavelet entropies
associated to fGn, −1 < α < 1. In particular, the range −1 < α < 0, to our
knowledge, has never been studied.

We have shown that, at least to characterize fBm’s and fGn’s processes, the
NTWS family seems to be a better quantiﬁer than TLWS. In particular, the
SW fulﬁls all the requirements for a correct description of the overall α-range:
has its maximum at the white noise, diﬀerentiates between noises and pro-
e
SW = 0.827. Nevertheless,
cesses, and has the maximum range of variation, ∆
the SW is best suited to discern between diﬀerent fBm processes. Finally, in
the α > 0 case, an inverse dependence on N is observed: the NTWS family
increases its performance as N increases and the TLWS improves its perfor-
mance as N decreases. Although the NTWS family always improves with N
for any α value.

e

The procedure outlined in Sec. 2.1 can be followed to build new probability
distributions associated to wavelet resolution levels. The weight of each res-
olution level could be modiﬁed according to the requirements of the physical
problem under study.

APPENDIX

Following the methodology described in P´erez et al. [5] let us take as the
signal the noise s(t) = W H(t, ω)—ω is ﬁxed and represents one element of
the statistic ensemble and it will be omitted hereafter. Now, using the chaos
expansion described in Ref. [13], any fractional Gaussian noise can be written
as

where {ξn}n∈N are the Hermite functions, and the operator MH is deﬁned as
follows

W H(t) =

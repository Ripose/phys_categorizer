In this note we present studies of coverage and power for conﬁdence intervals for a Poisson process with known
background calculated using the Likelihood ratio (aka Feldman & Cousins) ordering with Bayesian treatment of
uncertainties in nuisance parameters. We consider both the variant where the Bayesian integration is done in both
the numerator and the denominator and the modiﬁcation where the integration is done only in the numerator whereas
in the denominator the likelihood is taken at the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters. Furthermore we
discuss how measurements can be combined in this framework and give an illustration with limits on the branching
ratio of a rare B-meson decay recently presented by CDF/D0. A set of C++ classes has been developed which can
be used to calculate conﬁdence intervals for single or combining multiple experiments using the above algorithms and
considering a variety of parameterizations to describe the uncertainties.

1 Introduction

A popular technique to calculate conﬁdence intervals
in recent years is the technique suggested by Feldman
& Cousins1. The method consists of constructing an
acceptance region for each possible hypothesis (in the
way as proposed by Neyman3) and ﬁxing the lim-
its of the region by including experimental outcomes
according to rank which is given by the likelihood
ratioa:

exactly known. The question on how to treat uncer-
tainties in nuisance parameters in conﬁdence interval
calculation, in particular in context of the frequentist
construction has drawn considerable attention in the
recent years. In 1992 Cousins & Highland2 proposed
a method which is based on a Bayesian treatment of
the nuisance parameters. The main idea is to use a
probability density function (pdf) in which the aver-
age is taken over the nuisance parameter:

R(s, n)L =

L(n|s + b)
L(n|sbest + b)

(1)

P (n|s, ǫ) −→

P (n|s, ǫ′)P (ǫ′|ǫ)d ǫ′ := q(n|s, ǫ)

Z

where s is the hypothesis, n the experimental out-
come, b the expected background, sbest is the hy-
pothesis most compatible with n and L the Like-
lihood function. The expected background b is an
example for a so called nuisance parameter., i.e. a
parameter which is not of primary interest but which
still aﬀects the calculated conﬁdence interval. An-
other example of such a nuisance parameter could
In the originally proposed

method by Feldman & Cousins, only the presence of
background was considered and it was assumed to be

(2)
where ǫ′ is the true value of the nuisance parame-
ter, ǫ denotes its estimate and s and n symbolize
the signal hypothesis and the experimental outcome
respectively.

Cousins & Highland only treated the case of
Gaussian uncertainties in the signal eﬃciency. The
method has since been generalized by Conrad et
al.4 to operate with the Feldman & Cousins order-
ing scheme and taking into account both eﬃciency
and background uncertainties as well as correlations.
This generalized method has already been used in

exactly) known background b

a number of particle and astroparticle physics ex-
periments (see references in Tegenfeldt & Conrad5).
FHC2 denotes this generalized method in the remain-
der of this note.

In case of signiﬁcantly less events observed than
expected background, FHC2 tends to result in con-
ﬁdence intervals which are becoming smaller with
increasing uncertainties. Hill6 therefore proposed a
modiﬁcation where in the ordering the likelihood ra-
tio is deﬁned as:

R(s, n)L =

q(n|s + b)
L(max (0, nobs − ˆb) + ˆb)

(3)

here ˆb is the maximum likelihood estimate of b given
the subsidiary observation of b. MBT (“Modiﬁed
Bayesian Treatment”) denotes this modiﬁcation in
the remainder of this note.

In this contribution, we discuss coverage and
power of these two methods as well as the combina-
tion of diﬀerent experiments with and without cor-
relations. We start by introducing the C++ library
which has been developed to be able to do the nec-
essary calculations.

2 POLE++

For the coverage studies presented in this paper a
reasonably fast and eﬃcient code is required. Hence,
a user-friendly and ﬂexible C++ library of classes
was developed based on the FORTRAN routine pre-
sented by Conrad8. The library is independent of ex-
ternal libraries and consists of two main classes, Pole
and Coverage. The ﬁrst class takes as input the num-
ber of observed events, the eﬃciency and background
with uncertainties and calculates the limits using the
method described in this paper. The integrals are
solved analytically. Coverage generates user-deﬁned
pseudo-experiments and calculates the coverage us-
ing Pole. Presently the library supports Gauss, log-
Normal and ﬂat pdf for description of the nuisance
parameters. Several Experiments with correlated or
uncorrelated uncertainties in the nuisance parame-
ters can be combined. The pole++ library can be
obtained from http://cern.ch/tegen/statistics.html

3 Coverage and Power

The most crucial property of methods for conﬁdence
interval construction is the coverage, which states

that a fraction (1-α) of inﬁnitely many repeated ex-
periments should yield conﬁdence intervals that in-
clude the true hypothesis irrespective of what the
true hypothesis is.

For a conﬁdence interval construction (accord-
ing to Neyman) without uncertainties in nuisance
parameters this property is fulﬁlled by construction.
In the present case however, we have to test the cov-
erage employing Monte Carlo experiments.

Power on the other hand is a concept which is de-
ﬁned in the context of hypothesis testing: the power
of a hypothesis testing method is the probability that
it will reject the null hypothesis, s0, given that the
alternative hypothesis strue is true. This concept is
rather diﬃcult to generalize to conﬁdence intervals
since the alternative hypothesis is not uniquely de-
ﬁned. We use the following deﬁnition for power:

Π(strue)s0 =

q(n|strue, ǫ)

(4)

Xn /∈Acc(s0)

and view power as a function of strue. Acc(s0) here
denotes the acceptance region of s0. This seems an
intuitively appealing measure: given the choice be-
tween diﬀerent methods, the one should be taken
which has minimally overlapping acceptance regions.
Typical examples of the coverage as function of
signal hypothesis are shown in ﬁgure 1. It can be seen
that the introduction of a continuous variable leads
to a considerable smoothing of the coverage plot. A
modest amount of over-coverage is introduced, sim-
ilarly for the MBT method and the FHC2 method.
For high Gaussian uncertainties in eﬃciency (∼ 40
%) the over-coverage of MBT is less pronounced than
for FHC2. More detailed coverage studies of the
FHC2 method have been presented by Tegenfeldt &
Conrad5. The power of the FHC2 and MBT meth-
ods is compared in ﬁgure 1 for 40 % uncertainties in
the eﬃciency. FHC2 as higher power for hypotheses
rather far away from the null hypotheses. This is
true only for large signals and comparably large un-
certainties (and for not too large diﬀerences between
s0 and strue), otherwise diﬀerences are negligible.

4 Combining diﬀerent experiments

The combination of experiments can be divided into
two cases. The simpler case is the one of completely
uncorrelated experiments: in this case the pdf used
in the construction are given by a multiplication of

We illustrate the eﬀect of combining diﬀerent exper-
iments with the example of the CDF limit on the
branching ratio for B0
In
this case, two CDF data sets are combined with an
uncorrelated uncertainty in the background expecta-
tion and an uncertainty in the eﬃciency which can be
factorized into a correlated and uncorrelated part7.
Bernhard et. al.7 presented a fully Bayesian combi-
nation, which is included in the table for comparison.
The limit obtained using the FHC2 method is slightly
smaller than the fully Bayesian limit.

5 Discussion & Conclusion

There are two main caveats when interpreting the
presented results: ﬁrst of all, the methods (more
or less implicitly) assume a ﬂat prior probability for
the true nuisance parameter. Thus, conclusions on
the coverage and power are true only for that prior.
This assumption seems particularly harmful in case
of combined experiments, a case for which we did
not calculate the coverage. Results presented at this
conference by Heinrich9 indicate that the assump-
tion of a ﬂat prior for nuisance parameters in each
channel leads to signiﬁcant under-coverage for fully

Bayesian conﬁdence intervals. Heinrich also shows,
that this behavior can be remedied with an appropri-
ate choice of prior (in his particular example: 1/ǫ).
For the methods presented here this might imply
that there is under-coverage in case of several com-
bined experiments. A second caveat, is that we test
the coverage only for 90% conﬁdence level. At this
conference Cranmer10 presented results that indicate
under-coverage for very high conﬁdence levels (> 5
σ) if uncertainties in the background are treated in
the Bayesian way. Tests of coverage for high conﬁ-
dence levels and combined experiments are currently
under way. With these caveats in mind, we con-
clude that Bayesian treatment of nuisance parame-
ters introduces a moderate amount of over-coverage.
The MBT method has less over-coverage for the case
with large Gaussian uncertainties in the signal eﬃ-
ciencies. We also compared the power of the two
suggested methods. For large uncertainties and large
true signals, the FHC2 method has higher power for
hypotheses relatively far away from the null hypoth-
esis.

Introduction

≥

Cosmic ray physics at energy E
10-100 TeV, due to the steepening of the spectrum, can be
performed only by using indirect measurements. An impressive amount of data has been collected
by extensive air shower arrays, Cherenkov detectors and underground muon experiments. The
challenge is the interpretation of these results. The bulk of the analysis are performed by
assuming a given Cosmic Ray spectrum and chemical composition (trial model), simulating
the particle interaction and the shower development in atmosphere and ﬁnally comparing the
simulated results with the real data. The reliability of the Monte Carlo simulation used is
therefore a primary task for the correct interpretation of these data: such diﬃculty stimulated a
lot of experimental work to validate the existing model and many theoretical ideas to improve the
simulation tools. Modelling a Monte Carlo to describe the high energy cosmic ray interactions
in atmosphere is a hard task, since Cosmic Rays studied with indirect measurements extend
to energy and kinematical regions non covered by the accelerator experiments yet. Morever
nucleus-nucleus collision have been investigated just up to few hundreds of GeV/nucleons. This
poorness of experimental data is reinforced by the lack of a completely computable theory for
the bulk of hadronic interactions, since QCD can be used only for high pt phenomena.

Many models have been developed in the last years, with diﬀerent enphasis on the
induced shower. Basically they can be splitted in two
various components of the C.R.
categories:
the models using parametrization of collider results(NIM85,HEMAS) and the
phenomenological models inspired for istance to the Dual Parton Model or similar ap-
proaches(DPMJET,SYBILL,QGSJET). I will concentrate in this talk on the HEMAS code[1],
stressing the results of the comparison with the experimental data.

2 HEMAS: description of the code

The HEMAS code was developed in the early ’90, when a new generation of experiments (LVD,
MACRO, EAS-TOP) were starting the data taking at Gran Sasso. This code is suited to
simulate high energy muons (Eµ≥
500GeV) and the electromagnetic size of the shower. It is a
phenomenological model, based on the parametrization of the collider data. The code describes
multiple hadron production by means of the multicluster model, suggested by UA5 experiment.
The total p-Air cross section is one of the most important ingredients of the codes. Since
the cross section of hadrons on nuclei is not measured directly at energies greater than several
hundred of GeV, an extrapolation to higher energies is required and is performed in the context
of ”log(s)” physics.

Figure 1 shows the HEMAS cross section p-Air as a function of the centre of mass energy

√s compared with the cross section used in other Monte Carlo codes.

Given the √s of the interaction, the average number of charged hadrons <nch> is choosen

according with the equation:

The actual number of charged hadrons nch is sampled from a a negative binomial distribution
with

Respect to the previous codes, where nch was sampled according to a poissonian, this choice
reﬂects in a larger ﬂuctuation of underground muon multiplicity. Particles are then grouped in
clusters, eventually decaying in mesons.

A relevant feature of HEMAS is the parametrization of muon parent mesons pt distribution.
While for single pion cluster pt is always sampled from an exponential, for kaon clusters, for the
leading particle and for pion clusters with at least two particles, pt has a given probability to be
extracted from a power low:

Nuclear target eﬀects are included too. The transverse momentum distribution is increased in
p-N collision respect to the p-p case, according to the so called ’Cronin eﬀect’[2]. The ratio
R(pt) of the inclusive cross section on a target of mass A to that on a proton target depends in
principle from the particle produced. In HEMAS, R(pt) has been approximated with a single
function:

R(pt) = (0.0363pt + 0.0570)K

where y is the laboratory rapidity and z=y/ln(s).

The HEMAS p-Air model interaction assumes a scaling violation in the central region and a
small violation in the forward region (xf >0.5). The original HEMAS code included a naive muon
transport code. This code was later replaced with the more sophisticated PROPMU code[3].
Morever in 1995, HEMAS was interfaced with DPMJET, a dual parton model inspired code[5].
The user has therefore the possibility of changing the original HEMAS hadronic interaction model
with DPMJET. As far as the CPU time is concerned HEMAS is a fast code. Table 1 shows the
CPU time required for protons of diﬀerent energies, while Table 2 shows the comparison with
other codes for a 200 TeV proton.

threshold are not transported in atmosphere and their contribution to the electromagnetic size
Ne, is computed according with the parametrization of pre-computed Monte Carlo runs[4]. Of
course the threshold is high enough (Eth≃
500 GeV) to follow the hadrons until they can decay
into an high energy muon, with some probability to survive deep underground. Anyway, as far
as the validity of this approximation is concerned, it must be stressed that for primary cosmic
rays with energy greater than

3 Comparison with experimental data

The HEMAS code has been widely used to simulate the underground muons detected at Gran
Sasso. When dealing with underground muons, many experimental observables depend both on
the cosmic ray chemical composition and on the features of the hadronic interaction model. To
test the reliability of the Monte Carlo codes it’s therefore important to study observables allowing
a disentangle. The shape of the decoherence, i.e. the distribution of the distance between muon
pairs, is weakly dependent on C.R. composition. This distribution is therefore a nice test to
check the reliability of a Monte Carlo code. The decoherence gets contribution from various
sources in the shower development:
- The primary cosmic ray cross section;
- the pt distribution of the muon parent hadrons;
- the multiple scattering of muons throught the rock.

Fig. 2 shows the average pt of the muon parent mesons as a function of the average muon

separation deep underground. The correlation between pt and <D> is evident.

The MACRO detector[6] is a powerfull experiment to study such distribution, taking advan-
10,000 m2sr. Recent results have been presented in[7]: the decoherence
tage of an acceptance A
function has been studied with a statistical sample of
350,000 real and 690,000 simulated muon
pairs. Fig.3 shows the comparison between HEMAS expectation(MACRO composition model[8])
and the MACRO data, properly corrected for the detector eﬀects: the agreement is impressive.
The selection of high muon multiplicity events allows to study very high energy primary cosmic
rays. Muons with multiplicity Nµ≥
1000 TeV.
The HEMAS expectation reproduces well the experimental data of this subsample of events too(
Fig. 4). The two extreme composition models used are taken from[9]. The comparison between
data and Monte Carlo has been performed also in diﬀerent windows of rock depth and cosθ. Fig.
5 shows the average distance between muon pairs in these windows: again HEMAS reproduces
quite well the experimental data.

muons is concerned, the HEMAS capability in reproducing the real data is impressive. Some
doubts pointed out by the HEMAS authors of a possible pt excess in the code are not supported
by the MACRO data [12].

Neverthless, since the indirect measurements aim to study the primary cosmic ray spectrum
and composition, a delicate sector of Monte Carlo simulation tools is the ”absolute” muon ﬂux. It
is of course an hard task to test experimentally the performance of the Monte Carlo codes, since
the muon ﬂux deep underground is the convolution of the cosmic ray spectrum and composition
with the hadronic interaction and the shower development features. Since the Cosmic Ray
spectrum is unknown we cannot use the muon ﬂux deep underground to test the Monte Carlo.
A step forward in this direction has been carried out by the MACRO and EAS-TOP Col-
laborations, with the so called ”anti-coincidences” analysis[11]. By selecting a muon events in
MACRO pointing to a ﬁducial area well internal to the EAS-TOP edges, it’s possible to select
two event samples:
a) if the number of ﬁred detectors Nf in EAS-TOP is <4, EAS-TOP does not provide any trigger
and the event is ﬂagged as ’anti-coincidence’. The correspondig C.R. energy ranges between 2
and few tens of TeV;
b) if 4<Nf <7, EAS-TOP provides a trigger and the events is ﬂagged as ’low energy coincidences’.
In the energy range covered by ’anti-coincidences’ and ’low energy coincidences’ direct mea-
surements of cosmic ray spectrum and composition are available. It is therefore possible to use
these data as input to the Monte Carlo simulation to test the hadronic interaction model, by
comparing the experimental data with the expectation. They used a single power low ﬁts to the
ﬂuxes of H and He, as reported by JACEE[14].

I stress that this analysis cannot be performed with MACRO alone, since low muon multiplic-
100TeV), where the spectrum

ity events get contribution also from higher energy cosmic ray(E
and the chemical composition have not been measured with direct techniques.

Table 3 shows the results of the analysis and the comparison between the real data and the
Monte Carlo codes HEMAS and HEMAS-DPMJET. Taking into account a 15-20% uncertainty
in the JACEE data ﬁts, the low energy coincidences are reproduced by both the Monte Carlo
codes. On the contrary HEMAS understimates the number of anti-coincidences respect to the
real data, while, within a 20% accuracy, HEMAS-DPMJET reproduces the experimental data.

experiments. It must be stressed that muons produced from the interaction of cosmic rays with

ward region’, poorly studied in accelerator experiments, requiring therefore an extrapolation in
the Monte Carlo. As it has been stressed in [13], the higher muon ﬂux in DPMJET in this kine-
matical region, reﬂects an intrinsic feature of this code, originating from the LUND treatment
of the fast valence ”diquark” fragmentation in the projectile. Fig.6 shows the average number
of muons survived deep undeerground (h=3400 hg/cm2) as a function of the proton energy for
diﬀerent Monte Carlo codes. The main diﬀerence between these codes are infact found at low
energy, where each code has to extrapolate the collider results with some algorithms. From this
point of view, models based on the Dual Parton Model, can in principle take advantage of the
limited number of free parameters, avoiding, at least in part, delicate extrapolations.

4 Conclusions

HEMAS is a fast Monte Carlo code for the simulation of high energy muons and electromagnetic
components of the air shower. MACRO data conﬁrm the HEMAS capability in reproducing the
lateral distribution of muons detected deep underground.

The ’low -energy coincidences’ analysis performed by the EAS-TOP and MACRO collabora-
tions pointed out a satisfactory agreement with HEMAS and HEMAS-DPMJET codes, within
the primary C.R. spectrum uncertainty; the ’anti-coincidences’ analysis suggested a possible
HEMAS muon deﬁcit at threshold energies ( Eo≃
few TeV). An improvement of the agreement
is found when using HEMAS interfaced with DPMJET.

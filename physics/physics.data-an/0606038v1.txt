We propose a new approach to the problem of the ﬁrst passage time. Our method is applicable not
only to the Wiener process but also to the non–Gaussian L´evy ﬂights or more complicated stochastic
processes whose distributions are stable. To show the usefulness of the method, we especially focus
on the ﬁrst passage time problems in the truncated L´evy ﬂights, in which arbitrarily large tail of
the L´evy distribution is cut oﬀ. We ﬁnd that the asymptotic scaling law of the ﬁrst passage time t
distribution changes from t−(α+1)/α-law (non-Gaussian L´evy regime) to t−3/2-law (Gaussian regime)
at the crossover point. This result means that an ultra-slow convergence from the non-Gaussian
L´evy regime to the Gaussian regime is observed not only in the distribution of the real time step
for the truncated L´evy ﬂight but also in the ﬁrst passage time distribution of the ﬂight. The nature
of the crossover in the scaling laws and the scaling relation on the crossover point with respect to
the eﬀective cut-oﬀ length of the L´evy distribution are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

The ﬁrst passage process or the ﬁrst passage time (FPT) problem is dealing with the event that a diﬀusing particle
or a random-walker ﬁrstly reaches a speciﬁc site at a speciﬁc time [1]. This FPT problems have been studies in
various research ﬁelds, such as statistical physics, chemistry [2] and biological neuroscience [3, 4] etc. In ﬁnancial area
of study, several authors [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] analyzed tick-by-tick data of USD/JPY (US Dollar/Japanese Yen) exchange
rate and studied the FPT distribution for which the FPT was deﬁned by the time that the rate ﬁrstly moves out from
a given range.

Among these studies, the USD/JPY exchange rates of the Sony bank [11] are reproduced from the market rates by
using some rate window with width of 0.1 yen [9, 10]. That is, if the USD/JPY market rate changes by more than
0.1 yen, the Sony bank rate for USD/JPY is updated to the market rates. In this sense, it is possible for us to say
that the procedure of determination of the USD/JPY exchange rate of the Sony bank is essentially the ﬁrst passage
process. In spite of such a lot of demands from various research ﬁelds and business of ﬁnancial markets, one could
have explicit analytical expression or solution of the FPT distribution only in very few cases. In addition, except
for a few case [12], most of the analytical expression is the case of the ordinary Wiener process (ordinary Brownian
motion).

With this fact in mind, in this paper, we propose a new approach to the problem of the ﬁrst passage time or ﬁrst
passage processes. Our method is applicable not only to the Wiener process but also to the anomalous diﬀusion of the
non-Gaussian L´evy ﬂights or more complicated stochastic processes. In order to show the usefulness of our approach,
we especially focus on the FPT problems in the truncated L´evy ﬂights [18, 19, 20], in which arbitrarily large tail of
the L´evy distribution is cut oﬀ. By using the method, we ﬁnd that the asymptotic scaling law of the ﬁrst passage
time t distribution changes from t−(α+1)/α-law (non-Gaussian L´evy regime) to t−3/2-law (Gaussian regime) at some
crossover point. This fact means that the crossover between non-Gaussian L´evy and Gaussian regimes is observed
not only in the distribution of the real time step of the truncated L´evy ﬂight, which was reported by Mantegna and
Stanley [18], but also in the ﬁrst passage time distribution of the ﬂight. Moreover, we give a scaling relation on the
crossover point with respect to the eﬀective cut-oﬀ length of the L´evy distribution. The scaling relation enables us to
predict the crossover point of the ﬁrst passage time distribution for a given truncated L´evy ﬂight.

This paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we explain general formalism of our method and apply
it to the FPT problem for the Wiener process, for which the solution of the FPT distribution is well-known, in
order to check the validity of our method. In Sec. III, we show that our method is widely useful for the class of

stable stochastic processes. We derive the FPT distribution for L´evy ﬂight which includes Gaussian and Lorentzian
stochastic processes as its special cases. For each stable stochastic process, we discuss the scaling law of the FPT
distribution in the asymptotic regime. In Sec. IV, we apply our method to the FPT problem of the truncated L´evy
ﬂight and discuss the crossover in the scaling laws of the FPT distribution between non-Gaussian L´evy and Gaussian
regimes. Last section is devoted to summary.

The problem we deal with in this paper is deﬁned as follows. Let us think about the stochastic process : Xk :
k = 0, 1,
. Then, our
problem is to obtain the distribution of t, namely, the ﬁrst passage time distribution P (t). In other words, we evaluate
the distribution of t, that is P (t), which is deﬁned as the survival probability that the time series Xk, starting from
ǫ, Xk0 + ǫ] up to the time step k0 + t. The problem we are dealing with
k = k0 keeps staying within the range [Xk0 −
here is motivated by the real mechanism of the Sony bank foreign exchange rate [9, 10]. The Sony bank rate is the
foreign exchange rate that the Sony bank oﬀers with reference to the market rate. Basically trades can be made on
the web [11] while the market is open. The Sony bank rate depends on the market rate but is independent of the
customers’ orders. If the USD/JPY market rate changes by ǫ =
0.1 yen or more, the Sony bank rate for USD/JPY
is updated to the market rate. For instance, for the stochastic process of the real market (what we call tick-by-tick
> ǫ, the Sony bank rate stays ﬂat from the time k = 0 to k = 1,
data) : X0, X1, X2,
· · ·
as the market rate is in the range of ǫ =
0.1 yen based on the market rate at k = 0. When the market rate exceeds
the range of ǫ = 0.1 yen at k = 2, the Sony bank rate is updated to the market rate. Obviously, the time interval
t = 2
0 = 2 here corresponds to the ﬁrst passage time we explained above and it is worth while for us to evaluate
its distribution P (t) in order to investigate statistical property of the Sony bank USD/JPY rates.

use the so-called image method [1, 15] to discuss the ﬁrst passage time problem. However, as we saw in equation
(1), our approach is completely diﬀerent from such standard treatments. In order to evaluate the FPT (probability)

within quite long time interval T . We might choose T as a time interval during which the market is open. Then, the

also our basic idea to evaluate the FPT distribution. From our method in order to evaluate the FPT distribution by

where P (1),

At a glance, this equation seems to be just a deﬁnition of the FPT distribution, however, for some classes of stochastic
processes, we can derive the explicit form of the FPT distribution from this simple equation. In the next subsection,
we derive the FPT distribution for the Wiener process as a simple test of our method. We would like to stress that
our approach helps intuitive account for the ﬁrst passage process and derivation of its distribution.

A. A simple test of the method for Wiener stochastic processes

To show the validity and usefulness of our method, we derive the FPT distribution from the above expression (4)
for Wiener stochastic processes (Brownian motion). The ordinary Wiener process is described by Xt+1 = Xt + Yt,
where the noise term Yt obeys the white Gaussian with zero-mean and variance σ2. Then, we should notice that the
t−1
j=0 Yk+j . As well-known, as
diﬀerence St ≡
= tσ2 variance. Using the same
the Gaussian process is stable, St obeys the Gaussian with zero-mean and
P
1)σ2 variance. Therefore, the
argument as St, St−1 also obeys the Gaussian with zero-mean and
FPT distribution P (t) derived by equation (4) leads to

Xk is rewritten in terms of sum of the noise terms Yt as St =

For the ordinary Wiener process, as the probability distributions for St and St−1 are Gaussians with zero mean

This well-known form is expected inverse Gaussian distribution [16] for the FPT distribution of the ordinary Wiener
process and is often observed in the so-called inter-spike interval (ISI) of the integrate-and-ﬁre model for neural
networks [3, 4, 17]. Therefore, in the asymptotic regime t
, the FPT distribution for the Wiener process obeys
t−3/2-scaling law. From the above discussion, we found that our new approach based on direct counting of the FPT
to obtain the FPT distribution is eﬀective and gives a well-known solution for the ordinary Wiener process.

Then, the stochastic process Yi is referred to as a stable process. It is obvious that for this class of stable processes,
the FPT distribution is easily obtained by our method because the probability distributions p(St) and p(St−1) to
evaluate Ω(p : St, St−1) in (5) are deﬁned explicitly. In the next subsections, we show several results from our new
approach.

As a ﬁrst simple example of the stable distributions, let us think about Lorentzian stochastic processes : Xt+1 =

Xt + Yt, where the noise term Yt obeys the following white Lorentzian :

Then, the characteristic function of the stochastic variable Yt is given by

From this result (16), we ﬁnd that the FPT distribution for the Lorentzian stochastic processes obeys Lorentzian. In
the asymptotic regime t

, the FPT distribution for the Lorentzian stochastic processes obeys t−2-scaling law.

We next consider the case of L´evy stochastic processes whose noise term Yt of the stochastic process Xt+1 = Xt + Yt

obeys the following L´evy distribution :

We should keep in mind that the above distribution (17) is reduced to the Wiener stochastic process (α = 2) and the
Lorentzian stochastic process (α = 1) as its special cases. As this process Yt (t = 1,

where Γ(x) means Gamma function and ρ is constant of order 1. Then, we should notice that the above scaling law

is consistent with both the Wiener stochastic process (P (t)
process (P (t)

As we saw through the above several stochastic processes, our new approach based on direct counting of the ﬁrst
passage time is widely useful for the class of stable stochastic processes and the ﬁnal expressions (5)(6) contain at most
just two integrals. Moreover, our approach can be applied to the FPT problems with a surprisingly wide variety of
absorbing boundary conditions. This is one of the advantage of our method over other approaches based on analysis of
Fokker-Plank equations. To show the advantage, in the next section, we apply our method to much more complicated
stochastic stable process.

IV. CROSSOVER IN SCALING LAWS OF FPT DISTRIBUTIONS

In the previous section, we showed our new formulation is eﬀective and much more simpler than the approach of
the (fractal) Fokker-Plank equations [12] to obtain the FPT distribution for stable stochastic processes. We actually
found that the FPT distribution of the general non-Gaussian L´evy stochastic process speciﬁed by parameter α is
is t−(α+1)/α-law. In this section, we show that our
obtained and its scaling behavior in the asymptotic regime t
formalism is also useful to obtain the FPT distribution for the so-called truncated L´evy ﬂight, which is well-known
that the crossover between the a L´evy and a Gaussian regime in the distribution of the real time step takes place
[18, 19, 20]. In this section, we show, by using our method based on direct counting of the ﬁrst passage time, this kind
of crossover in scaling laws is also observed in the ﬁrst passage time t. This section is a central part of this paper.

FIG. 1: Scaling laws of the FPT distribution for the truncated L´evy ﬂight. We set α = 1.2 and ∆ = 0.5 (upper left panel), 1.0 (upper
right panel) and ∆ = 2.0 (lower panel). We ﬁnd a clear crossover between L´evy and Gaussian regimes. The scaling laws change at the
crossover point t× ≃ 44 (∆ = 0.5), 19 (∆ = 1.0) and t× ≃ 8 (∆ = 2.0). Below the crossover point t×, the scaling laws are those of the
L´evy : t−(α+1)/α = t−1.83, whereas, above t×, the scaling laws become those of the Gaussian : t−3/2. In these three panels, we ﬁnd that
the scaling relation : t×(∆ = 0.5)/t×(∆ = 1.0) = t×(∆ = 1.0)/t×(∆ = 2.0) = 2α ≃ 2.297 holds for the crossover points.

Let us summarize the result for the scaling laws of the FPT distribution for the truncated L´evy ﬂight.

We should be in mind that the crossover point t× obtained by (31) contains integral variable Q. Therefore, it is hard
to say that t× is well-deﬁned. To delete the Q-dependence of the t×, we consider the ratio of t×(∆) and t×(2∆).
From equation (31), we obtain t×(∆)/t×(2∆) = 2α, namely, t×(∆) = 2αt×(2∆). Let us check this scaling relation for
the result we obtained in FIG. 1. For α = 1.2, the relation reads t×(∆) = 21.2t×(2∆) = 2.297 t×(2∆). This relation
predicts the crossover point t×(∆ = 0.5)/t×(∆ = 1.0) = t×(∆ = 1.0)/t×(∆ = 2.0) = 2.297, which is very close to the
2.375. The small amount of the diﬀerence is supposed
results obtained in FIG. 1, namely, 44/19
to be caused by impreciseness of numerical integrations appearing in equation (27).

The relation t×(∆) = 2αt×(2∆) for successive values of ∆ and 2∆ is easily extended for the relation between ∆

This scaling relation for the crossover point t× in the scaling laws of the FPT distribution of the truncated L´evy ﬂight
t× is one of our main results in this paper. From this result (34), we ﬁnd that the crossover point t× increases rapidly

is observed not only in the distribution of the real time n ﬂight, which was reported by Mantegna and Stanley [18],
but also in the FPT distribution of the truncated L´evy ﬂight.

In the study by Mantegna and Stanley [18], they investigated the stochastic variable zn =

Xk−1 obeys the truncated L´evy ﬂight. They evaluated the probability of return P (zn = 0) and found that the
P (zn = 0) obeys the Gaussian n−1/2-law in large real time step n regime. In this section, it was shown that this
ultra-slow convergence from L´evy regime to the Gaussian regime is conserved even if we consider the ﬁrst passage
process of the truncated L´evy ﬂight. The relation between their results and ours is understood clearly as follows.

V. SUMMARY

In this paper, we proposed a new approach to evaluate the ﬁrst passage time distribution. Our method is based on
direct counting of the ﬁrst passage time. We showed that our approach gives explicit form of the FPT distribution
for stable stochastic processes. Actually, for the Wiener (Brownian motion), the Lorentzian and the L´evy stochastic
processes, our method was demonstrated. Thanks to mathematical simplicity of our method, it becomes easy for us
to grasp the intuitive meaning of the FPT distribution and to tackle with much more complicated stochastic process.
As such a example, we discussed the FPT distribution of the truncated L´evy ﬂight. We found a clear crossover
between non-Gaussian L´evy and Gaussian regimes in the scaling laws of the FPT distribution. We found the scaling
relation on the crossover point t× with respect to the eﬀective length l of the cut-oﬀ as t×(l) = (l/l0)αt×(l0) with
l0 = ∆−1. We hope that beyond the present analysis for the Sony bank rate, our approach might be widely used in
many scientiﬁc research ﬁelds, especially in the ﬁeld of econophysics including ﬁnancial data analysis.

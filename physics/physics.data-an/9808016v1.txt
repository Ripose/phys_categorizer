Abstract

We propose a method to estimate the probability of new physics dis-
covery in future high energy physics experiments. Physics simulation
gives both the average numbers < Nb > of background and < Ns >
of signal events. We ﬁnd that the proper deﬁnition of the signiﬁcance

Introduction

One of the common goals in the forthcoming experiments is the search for
new phenomena. In the forthcoming high energy physics experiments (LHC,
TEV22, NLC, ...) the main goal is the search for physics beyond the Stan-
dard Model (supersymmetry, Z ′-, W ′-bosons, ...) and the Higgs boson dis-
covery as a ﬁnal conﬁrmation of the Standard Model. In estimation of the
discovery potential of the future experiments (to be speciﬁc in this paper we
shall use as an example CMS experiment at LHC [1]) the background cross
section is calculated and for the given integrated luminosity L the average
L. Suppose the existence of
number of background events is < Nb >= σb
a new physics leads to the nonzero signal cross section σs with the same
signature as for the background cross section that results in the prediction
of the additional average number of signal events < Ns >= σs
L for the
integrated luminosity L.

·

·

The total average number of the events is < Nev >=< Ns > + < Nb >=
(σs + σb)
L. So, as a result of new physics existence, we expect an excess
of the average number of events. In real experiments the probability of the
realization of n events is described by Poisson distribution [2]

·

f (n, < n >) =

< n >n
n!

e−<n>.

(1)

Here < n > is the average number of events.
Remember that the Poisson distribution f (n, < n >) gives [3] the proba-
bility of ﬁnding exactly n events in the given interval of (e.g. space and time)
when the events occur independently of one another and of x at an average
rate of < n > per the given interval. For the Poisson distribution the vari-
ance σ2 equals to < n >. So, to estimate the probability of the new physics
discovery we have to compare the Poisson statistics with < n >=< Nb >
and < n >=< Nb > + < Ns >. Usually, high energy physicists use the
following “signiﬁcances” for testing the possibility to discover new physics
in an experiment:

(a) “signiﬁcance” S1 =

It should be noted that there is a crucial diﬀerence between “future”
experiment and the “real” experiment. In the “real” experiment the total
number of events Nev is a given number (already has been measured) and we
compare it with < Nb > when we test the validity of the standard physics.
So, the number of possible signal events is determined as Ns = Nev
< Nb >
and it is compared with the average number of background events < Nb >.
The ﬂuctuation of the background is σf b = √Nb, therefore, we come to the
S1 signiﬁcance as the measure of the distinction from the standard physics.
In the conditions of the “future” experiment when we want to search for new
physics, we know only the average number of the background events and
the average number of the signal events, so we have to compare the Poisson
distributions P (n, < Nb >) and P (n, < Nb > + < Ns >) to determine the
probability to ﬁnd new physics in the future experiment.

In this paper we estimate the probability to discover new physics in
future experiments. We show that for < Ns >, < Nb >

The organization of the paper is the following. In the next section we
give a method for the determination of the probability to ﬁnd new physics in
the future experiment and calculate the probability to discover new physics
for the given (< Nb >, < Ns >) numbers of background and signal events
under the assumption that there are no systematic errors. In section 3 we es-
timate the inﬂuence of the systematics related to the nonexact knowledge of
the signal and background cross sections on the probability to discover new
physics in future experiments. Section 4 contains the concluding remarks.

2 An analysis of statistical ﬂuctuations

Suppose that for some future experiment we know the average number of the
background and signal event < Nb >, < Ns >. As it has been mentioned in
the Introduction, the probability of realization of n events in an experiment
is given by the Poisson distribution

2

P (n, < n >) =

< n >n
n!

e−<n>,

(2)

where < n >=< Nb > for the case of the absence of new physics and
< n >=< Nb > + < Ns > for the case when new physics exists. So, to
determine the probability to discover new physics in future experiment, we
have to compare the Poisson distributions with < n >=< Nb > (standard
physics) and < n >=< Nb > + < Ns > (new physics).

Consider, at ﬁrst, the case when < Nb >

1, < Ns >

1. In this

case the Poisson distributions approach the Gaussian distributions

with µ = σ2 and µ =< Nb > or µ =< Nb > + < Ns >. Here n is a real

number.

The Gaussian distribution describes the probability density to realize
n events in the future experiment provided the average number of events
< n > is a given number. In Fig.1 we show two Gaussian distributions PG
with < n >=< Nb >= 53 and < n >=< Nb > + < Ns > = 104 ([6], Ta-
ble.13, cut 6). As is clear from Fig.1 the common area for these two curves
(the ﬁrst curve shows the “standard physics” events distribution and the
second one gives the “new physics” events distribution) is the probability
that “new physics” can be described by the “standard physics”. In other
words, suppose we know for sure that new physics takes place and the prob-
ability density of the events realization is described by curve II (f2(x)). The
probability κ that the “standard physics” (curve I (f1(x))) can imitate new
physics (i.e. the probability that we measure “new physics” but we think
that it is described by the “standard physics”) is described by common area
of curve I and II.

Numerically, we ﬁnd that

It means that for S12 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 the probability κ is correspondingly

of the signiﬁcance are mainly used in the literature: S1 =

S1 and S2 as S12 =

It means that for S1 = 5 (according to a common convention the 5σ
conﬁdence level means a new physics discovery) the real signiﬁcance is S12 =
2.5, that corresponds to κ = 1.2%.

For the case Ns = kNb, S12 = k12S2, where for k = 0.5, 1, 4, 10 the value
of k12 is k12 = 0.55, 0.59, 0.69, 0.77. For not too high values of < Nb >
and < Nb + Ns >, we have to compare the Poisson distributions directly.
Again for the Poisson distribution P (n, < n >) with the area of deﬁnition
for nonnegative integers we can deﬁne P (x, < n >) for real x as

˜P (x, < n >) =

So, the generalization of the previous determination of κ in our case is
straightforward, namely, κ is nothing but the common area of the curves
described by ˜P (x, < Nb >) (curve I) and ˜P (x, < Nb > + < Ns >) (curve II)
(see, Fig.2).

Numerical results are presented in Tables 1-6.
As it follows from these Tables for ﬁnite values of < Ns > and < Nb >
the deviation from asymptotic formula (4) is essential. For instance, for
Ns = 5, Nb = 1 (S1 = 5) κ = 14%. For Ns = Nb = 25 (S1 = 5) κ = 3.9%,
whereas asymptotically for Ns
1 we ﬁnd κ = 1.2%. Similar situation
takes place for Ns

3 An account of systematic errors related to nonex-
act knowledge of background and signal cross
sections

In the previous section we determined the statistical error κ (the probability
that “new physics” is described by “standard physics”). In this section we
investigate the inﬂuence of the systematical errors related to a nonexact
knowledge of the background and signal cross sections on the probability κ
not to confuse a new physics with the old one.

Denote the Born background and signal cross sections as σ0

An account of one loop corrections leads to σ0

Two loop corrections at present are not known. So, we can assume that
the uncertainty related with nonexact knowledge of cross sections is around
δ1b and δ1s correspondingly. In other words, we assume that the exact cross
b , σ0
sections lie in the intervals (σ0
s (1 + 2δ1s)). The
average number of background and signal events lie in the intervals

b (1 + 2δ1b)) and (σ0

To determine the probability that the new physics is described by the old
one, we again have to compare two Poisson distributions with and without
new physics but in distinction from Section 2 we have to compare the Poisson
distributions in which the average numbers lie in some intervals. So, a priori
the only thing we know is that the average numbers of background and signal
events lie in the intervals (9) and (10), but we do not know the exact values
of < Nb > and < Ns >. To determine the probability that the new physics
is described by the old, consider the worst case when we think that new
physics is described by the minimal number of average events

< N min

b >=< N 0

b > + < N 0

s > .

(11)

Due to the fact that we do not know the exact value of the background
cross section, consider the worst case when the average number of back-
ground events is equal to < N 0
b > (1 + 2δ1b). So, we have to compare the
Poisson distributions with < n >=< N 0
s >=
b > (1 + 2δ1b) + (< N 0

(1 + 2δ1b). Using the result of the previous Section, we ﬁnd that for case

For the limiting case δ1b

values of < N 0
section (Tables 1-6).

As an example consider the case when δ1b = 0.5, < Ns >= 100, < Nb >=

50 (typical situation for sleptons search). In this case we ﬁnd that

S1 =

< Ns >
√< Nb >

= 14.1,

S2 =

< Ns >
√< Ns > + < Nb >
S12 = √< Nb > + < Ns >

√< Nb > = 5.2,

= 8.2

−

S12s = √< Nb > + < Ns >

√2 < Nb > = 2.25.

−

The diﬀerence between CMS adopted signiﬁcance S2 = 8.2 (that corre-
10−6) and the signiﬁcance S12s = 2.25
sponds to the probability κ = 0.206
taking into account systematics related to nonexact knowledge of back-
ground cross section is factor 3.6 The direct comparison of the Poisson dis-
tributions with < Nb > (1 + 2δ1b) = 100 and < Nb > (1 + 2δ1b)+ < Ns,ef f >
( < Ns,ef f >=< Ns >

2δ1b < Nb >= 50) gives κs = 0.0245.

·

Another example is with < Ns >= 28, < Nb >= 8 and δ1b = 0.5. For
such example we have S1 = 9.9, S2 = 4.7, S12 = 3.2, S12s = 2.0, κs = 0.045.
So, we see that an account of the systematics related to nonexact knowl-
edge of background cross sections is very essential and it decreases the LHC
SUSY discovery potential.

−

4 Conclusions

In this paper we determined the probability to discover the new physics in
the future experiments when the average number of background < Nb >
and signal events < Ns > is known. We have found that in this case for
< Ns >

√< Nb >

−
in comparison with often used expressions for the signiﬁcances S1 =

< Ns >
√< Nb >

and S2 =

√< Ns > + < Nb >

.

≪

For < Ns >

< Nb > we have found that S12 = 0.5S1 = 0.5S2.
For not too high values of < Ns > and < Nb >, when the deviations from
the Gaussian distributions are essential, our results are presented in Tables
1-6. We also proposed a method for taking into account systematical errors
related to the nonexact knowledge of background and signal events. An
account of such kind of systematics is very essential in the search for super-
symmetry and leads to an essential decrease in the probability to discover
the new physics in the future experiments.

We are indebted to M.Dittmar for very hot discussions and useful ques-
tions which were one of the motivations to perform this study. We are
grateful to V.A.Matveev for the interest and useful comments.

For the scale-dependent analysis of stochastic data it is common to use the increment ∆l(t, r) =
ξ(t+r)−ξ(t) of a data set ξ(t) as a stochastic measure, where r denotes the scale. Recently we found
that in some cases spurious correlations between scales can be introduced by this increment deﬁni-
tion. On the other hand, these spurious correlations can be avoided by an appropriate, alternative
deﬁnition. In this contribution we demonstrate this eﬀect for diﬀerent data sets and show how it
can be detected and quantiﬁed. The method additionally allows to distinguish between behaviour
similar to noise or random walk for experimental data.

INTRODUCTION

In the recent years, common methods for the scale de-
pendent analysis of stochastic data have been extended
by the introduction of methods which consider not only
single scale probability densitiy functions (pdf) but also
multiscale pdf, e.g. [1]. The term scale here means for a
t′ between
stochastic data set ξ(t) the distance r = t
two points t, t′ (t may denote time as well as space in
this context). Most important for these methods is the
analysis of connections between diﬀerent scales. We want
to note that for the class of Markov processes the knowl-
edge of two-scale joint or conditional pdf is suﬃcient for
a complete description of multiscale pdf. If the noise in-
volved in the process is Gaussian distributed, this can be
done by means of a Fokker-Planck or Langevin equation
[2, 3, 4, 5].

Diﬀerent quantities may be used as scale-dependent
measures of complexity and disorder. A quite common
one is the increment which is usually deﬁned as

∆l(t, r) = ξ(t + r)

ξ(t)

for a time or spatial series ξ(t). We will call this the left-
justiﬁed deﬁnition. Alternatively also a symmetrical or
centered deﬁnition

∆c(t, r) = ξ(t + r/2)

may be used. During the analysis of stochastic data from
diﬀerent measurements we found that in some cases the
increment deﬁnition has an important inﬂuence on the
correlations between scales.

In this contribution we want to address the question
whether the use of left-justiﬁed increments may intro-
duce spurious correlations between diﬀerent scales r0, r1,
and how this eﬀect can be avoided. We also will see

for which kinds of measurement data this is of concern,
thus diﬀerentiating between data sets which behave more
like uncorrelated noise and those which behave more like
a random walk [6], with respect to the regarded length
scale r.

INCREMENT DEFINITIONS AND

CORRELATIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT
SCALES

Spurious correlations between diﬀerent scales r0, r1 can
be introduced by the left-justiﬁed increment ∆l(t, r) be-
cause for a ﬁxed value t0 the increments ∆l(t0, r) of all
scales r will have the term ξ(t0) in common, see eq. (1).
Thus the statistics of ∆l(t, r) contains information from
adjacent scales, which may lead to an apparent corre-
lation. On the other hand, for ∆c(t0, r) increments on
diﬀerent scales are derived from diﬀerent measurement
points, see eq. (2).

As a most sensitive example to this eﬀect we will con-
sider the increment statistics of an uncorrelated noise
= δt,t′. Data have
Γ(t) with
been generated using the routine gasdev from [7] and
normalized by σ∞ [8]. In ﬁg. 1 we show conditional pdf
for left-justiﬁed and centered increments of uncorrelated
noise. A conditional pdf p(∆1(t, r1)
∆0(t, r0)) denotes
|
the probability of ﬁnding the increment ∆(t, r1) = ∆1 on
the scale r1 under the condition that at the same time t
on a diﬀerent scale r0 another increment ∆(t, r0) = ∆0
has been found. The diﬀerence between the statistics of
left-justiﬁed and centered increments in ﬁg. 1 is obvious.
For the left-justiﬁed increments (a) a correlation between
both scales r1, r0 is evident because p(∆l(t, r1)
∆l(t, r0))
|
strongly depends on the value of ∆l(t, r0). In contrast,
the conditional pdf of the centered increments (b) is inde-
pendent of ∆c(t, r0) and thus both scales are uncorrelated
for centered increments.

III. CONSEQUENCES FOR MARKOV
PROPERTIES

It is easy to see that the left-justiﬁed increment ∆l(t, r)
of an uncorrelated Gaussian noise is consequently not a
Markov process in the scale variable r. As mentioned
above, a Markov process is completely deﬁned by two-
dimensional pdf p(x2, r2; x1, r1) or, alternatively, by the
conditional probability density

p(x2, r2

x1, r1) = p(x2, r2; x1, r1)/p(x1, r1) .

A necessary condition for a stochastic process to be
Markovian is the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation [2]

and

for any triplet r1 < r2 < r3.

Consider now an uncorrelated, Gaussian-distributed
noise Γ(t) with mean value a and standard deviation σ.
We will focus on the correlations between left-justiﬁed
increments ∆1 = ∆l(t, r1), ∆2 = ∆l(t, r2) of Γ(t) as ran-
dom variables depending on the scale variable r:

From this non-diagonal correlation matrix it is already
clear that the left-justiﬁed increment deﬁnition intro-
duces additional correlations between arbitrary diﬀerent
scales r1

= r2.

Because the diﬀerence of two Gaussian distributed
random variables is also Gaussian, we can derive two-
dimensional pdf of the variables ∆1, ∆2 using the gen-
eral two-dimensional form of the Gaussian distribution

The question if or if not the above-mentioned spurious
correlations between diﬀerent scales are introduced by
the increment deﬁnition is of practical importance for
the analysis of measured data. For data which behave
ξ(t + r)
like a random walk, i.e.
= x0 rather
h
= 0 as for uncorrelated noise
ξ(t) = x0
than
i
(the validity of these relations will generally depend on
r) the increment deﬁnition should be unimportant. No
spurious correlations would be created in either case. In
contrary, for data which behave more like an uncorrelated
noise, the increment deﬁnition will be more important.

plays pdf of both increment types obtained from surface
height proﬁles of a smooth asphalt road. The distance be-
tween consecutive data points is 1.04 mm, further details
of the measurement are found in [5, 9]. The diﬀerence
between both types of increments is evident and similar
to that for the uncorrelated noise in ﬁg. 1. In ﬁg. 2(b)
and (c) conditional pdf are shown in the same manner
for velocity increments measured in a turbulent free jet
104. For details please see [4]. Scale r1
at Re = 2.7
in both cases is L/2, the scale diﬀerence r0
r1 is small
(1.5 λ) for (b) and large (L) for (c) [10]. It can be seen
in ﬁg. 2(b) that here conditional pdf of left-justiﬁed and
centered increments are identical and the increment def-
inition does not inﬂuence the statistics. For r = L at the
end of the inertial range, ﬁg. 2(c), a slight diﬀerence of
both conditional pdf has already occurred. Nevertheless
only a small fraction of the correlation between the scales
r0, r1 is detected as spurious here.

can be estimated from the measured data. It quantiﬁes
the inﬂuence of the value ξ(t) = x0 on the left-justiﬁed
increment ∆l(t, r).
If there is a strong dependence of
T on x0 the data must be regarded as noise-like in the
respective length scale, and for scale dependent analysis
the use of left-justiﬁed increments is not appropriate. If
otherwise that quantity is independent of x0 the data
behave like a random walk in this sense, and thus the
increment deﬁnition is not important. In ﬁg. 3 we present
the dependence of T on ξ(t) = x0 for diﬀerent data sets.
Data of both ideal cases, the uncorrelated noise and the
random walk, were generated as in ﬁg. 1. Turbulence
and asphalt road data have already been shown in ﬁg. 2.
As expected, we see that for the random walk there is
no dependence of T (r, x0) on x0.
In contrast, for the
noise as well as for the surface data the dependence is
x0 in a stochastical sense. For

the turbulent velocity increments it can be seen that on
the small scale r = λ there is only little inﬂuence of x0
on T , while on the large scale r = L the dependence
is more pronounced. This ﬁnding corresponds to ﬁg. 2
where for small scales the conditional pdf of left-justiﬁed
and centered increments were identical, while for large
scales a diﬀerence occurred.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We found that for scale dependent analysis of stochas-
tic data where the connections between diﬀerent scales
are investigated using increment statistics, the deﬁnition
of the increment can be important, depending on the na-
ture of the data. Apparent correlations between scales
may be introduced by the left-justiﬁed increment. The
importance of the increment deﬁnition varies between the
ideal cases of a random walk [6], where it is nonrelevant,
and an uncorrelated noise, where it is crucial. In this case
the use of left-justiﬁed increments leads to erraneous re-
sults for correlations between diﬀerent scales. Especially
the surface measurement data we have studied require
the centered deﬁnition on all accessible scales [5, 11].
For turbulent velocities this inﬂuence depends on the re-

garded length (or time) scale r, detailed consequences
are currently investigated [12]. The conditional expec-
tation value T (r, x0) allows to quantify the inﬂuence of
a left-justiﬁed increment. Nevertheless, the speciﬁcation
of a threshold in a statistically meaningful way is still an
open question.

While in this contribution we used the increments (1)
and (2) to demonstrate the introduction of spurious cor-
relations, we expect that these considerations can be ap-
plied to general scale-dependent measures of complexity,
over an inter-
(ξ(t)
such as the variance wr(t) =

distinguish between measures which are orthogonal on
diﬀerent scales and those which are not [13]. We expect
similar results for correlations between scales as demon-
strated here for left-justiﬁed and centered increments.

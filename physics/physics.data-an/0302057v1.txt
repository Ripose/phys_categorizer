Abstract

The incorporation of systematic uncertainties into conﬁdence interval calculations has been ad-

dressed recently in a paper by Conrad et al. (Physical Review D 67 (2003) 012002). In their work,

systematic uncertainities in detector eﬃciencies and background ﬂux predictions were incorporated

following the hybrid frequentist-Bayesian prescription of Cousins and Highland, but using the like-

lihood ratio ordering of Feldman and Cousins in order to produce “uniﬁed” conﬁdence intervals. In

general, the resulting intervals behaved as one would intuitively expect, i.e. increased with increas-

ing uncertainties. However, it was noted that for numbers of observed events less than or of order

of the expected background, the intervals could sometimes behave in a completely counter-intuitive

fashion – being seen to initially decrease in the face of increasing uncertainties, but only for the

case of increasing signal eﬃciency uncertainty. In this comment, we show that the problematic

behaviour is due to integration over the signal eﬃciency uncertainty while maximising the best ﬁt

alternative hypothesis likelihood. If the alternative hypothesis likelihood is determined by uncon-

ditionally maximising with respect to both the unknown signal and signal eﬃciency uncertainty,

the limits display the correct intuitive behaviour.

In their recent paper, Conrad et al.[1] incorporated uncertainties on signal and back-

ground eﬃciencies into limit calculations by applying the standard classical likelihood ra-

tio technique[2], recently popularised by Feldman and Cousins[3], to the hybrid Bayesian-

frequentist method of Cousins and Highland[4].

In this method, the ﬁxed-but-unknown

signal strength parameter µs is treated in a frequentist fashion, but the unknown experi-

mental eﬃciencies (ǫs and ǫb) are incorporated by integrating over prior probability distri-

butions P (ǫs) and P (ǫb). This simpliﬁes the conﬁdence interval calculation by reducing the

dimensionality of the problem down to only one unknown variable. The resulting intervals

showed the correct intuitive behaviour in most cases, i.e. the conﬁdence intervals were seen

to increase as the uncertainties in the eﬃciencies were increased. However, it was noted

that some counter-intuitive behaviour could occur for cases where the observed number of

events n0 was less than or of order of the expected background µb. In these cases, the limits

sometimes initially became more restrictive as the uncertainties were increased, a behaviour

which anyone would agree was undesirable. This behaviour was also noted in an earlier paper

by Giunti[5]. In this comment, we show that the noted undesirable behaviour is due to the

choice of likelihood ratio test implemented by Conrad et al., and show how a choice more

consistent with the generalised likelihood ratio test in the presence of nuisance parameters

eliminates this behaviour, leading to intervals with acceptable behaviour as uncertainties

are increased. The key to the correction is the choice of treatment of the uncertainties in

the likelihood ratio denominator; Conrad et al. chose to integrate over uncertainties in both

the numerator and denominator, which leads to the counter intuitive behavior. We show

here how integrating in the numerator, but maximising with respect to the uncertainties in

the denominator leads to the correct intuitive behaviour.

We consider speciﬁcally the problematic case from Conrad et al., the determination of

a conﬁdence limit on an unknown Poisson signal strength µs in the presence of a precisely

known background µb but where the signal eﬃciency ǫs is also unknown. Before considering

the approach of Conrad et al., we note that a completely frequentist treatment would involve

the construction of a conﬁdence region in the µs − ǫs plane, where the acceptability of each

possible outcome n under a null hypothesis {µs, ǫs} is determined by a likelihood ratio

test[2, 3], where the likelihood ratio R

R =

L(n | µs, µb, ǫs)
L(n | ˆµs, µb, ˆǫs)

compares the likelihood under the null hypothesis to the likelihood of the alternative hy-

pothesis {ˆµs, ˆǫs} that best describes the possible observation n, i.e. ˆµs and ˆǫs are the values

that unconditionally maximise the likelihood of observing n events. Values of n where
L(n | µs, µb, ǫs) is close to the maximum possible value L(n | ˆµs, µb, ˆǫs) are most acceptable

and are therefore ﬁrst included into acceptance intervals during the conﬁdence interval con-

struction. To reduce the dimensionality of the problem, the suggested procedure[2] is to

conditionally maximise the numerator with respect to the nuisance parameter ǫs yielding a

likelihood ratio

L(n | µs, µb, ˆˆǫs)
L(n | ˆµs, µb, ˆǫs)
The Cousins-Highland approach is a hybrid frequentist-Bayesian method where the in-

R =

corporation of a systematic uncertainty in the eﬃciency ǫs proceeds by integrating over a

prior probability function P (ǫs | ˆǫs, σǫs), describing our knowledge of the nuisance parameter

ǫs, but where the unknown signal strength µs is still treated in a classical frequentist fashion.

This yields a likelihood function

L(n | µs, µb, P (ǫs | ˆǫs, σǫs)) =

which is used to construct classical conﬁdence intervals in the ﬁxed but unknown signal

strength µs. We still need an ordering principle to decide which values of n are to be included

in the acceptance interval for each null hypothesis µs. Conrad et al. used a Feldman-Cousins

style likelihood ratio ordering principle (equation 1 or 2) to choose which values of n fall

into the acceptance interval for a given µs. This uniﬁes the treatment of upper limits and

two-sided conﬁdence regions. However, it is their treatment of the uncertainties in the

determination of the best alternative hypothesis in the likelihood ratio test which leads to

the counter-intuitive behaviour of the conﬁdence intervals. Conrad et al. used a likelihood

ratio of the form

where the uncertainties are integrated over in both the numerator and denominator. In-

tegration over the uncertainties has the desired eﬀect on the numerator likelihood where

values n near the mean ˆǫsµs + µb become less probable in favour of higher and lower values

of n as σǫs increases. Integration over uncertainties while ﬁnding ˆµs still results in ˆµs = 0.0

for n < µb. However, for n > µb, the best ﬁt value ˆµs for a given n as well as the probability

3

of this best ﬁt value used in the denominator decreases as σǫs increases. The net eﬀect is a

shift in the peak of the likelihood ratio distribution to higher n, that then leads to the prob-

lematic behaviour in the conﬁdence intervals by sometimes shifting the acceptance region

{nlo(µs | σǫs = 0.0), nhi (µs | σǫs = 0.0)} for zero uncertainties to higher values of n where

nlo(µs | σǫs > 0.0) > nlo(µs | σǫs = 0.0)

(5)

as the uncertainty is included. Since the upper limit µlim

s

for a given observation n0 is the

highest value of µs for which n0 is still in the acceptance interval, shifting the acceptance
interval for values of µ at or below the limit µlim

s will lead to a lowering of the limit. An

example of this eﬀect is shown in table I, where we examine the speciﬁc problematic case

from Conrad et al.. The 90% conﬁdence level upper limits for observations of n0 = 2, 4 and

6 events on a precisely known background of µb = 6.0 in the presence of various percent-

age Gaussian uncertainties in the signal eﬃciency are shown, using the likelihood ratio of

Conrad et al. (equation 4). We note that our limits for the Conrad et al. ordering are not

exactly as given in their paper as we here test the null hypothesis in increments of 0.01,

rather than 0.05. Nonetheless, the limit for the case of n0 = 2 is seen to decrease as the

eﬃciency error increases from 0 to 40% (1.56 → 1.45), before ﬁnally increasing. For the

n0 = 4 and 6 cases, the limits decrease as σǫ goes from 0 to 10%, but then increase.

We can correct this behaviour by constructing a hybrid frequentist-Bayesian likelihood

ratio test, where the numerator retains the integration over the uncertainties but where

the alternative hypothesis is found by unconditionally maximising the denominator as in

the pure frequentist tests in equations 1 and 2. This yields the following likelihood ratio

statistic

where the inclusion into the acceptance interval of given n’s is determined by comparison of

their likelihood after integration over uncertainties to the likelihood of the best ﬁt ˆµs given

no uncertainty. This way, the likelihoods given any value of the uncertainty σǫs are always

compared to the simple alternative hypothesis {ˆµs, ˆǫs} which best describes the observation

n, rather to one that changes with σǫs.

Table I shows that the limits using the ordering from equation 6 are seen to initially

remain the same (due to overcoverage from the discrete nature of the Poisson distribution)

but then increase with increasing uncertainty. We also note that although the Conrad et al.

4

limits do ﬁnally increase as the uncertainties grow bigger, they are always smaller than the

limits found using the likelihood ratio in equation 6.

TABLE I: Comparison between upper limits in the presence of signal eﬃciency uncertainties using

the Conrad et al. likelihood ratio ordering and the ordering in this present work. The Conrad et al.

limits initially decrease as uncertainties are increased, whereas the likelihood ratio ordering de-

scribed here results in limits with the desired behaviour, i.e. they increase as the uncertainties

increase.

We consider noise-driven exit from a domain of attraction in a two-dimensional bistable system
lacking detailed balance. Through analog and digital stochastic simulations, we ﬁnd a theoretically
predicted bifurcation of the most probable exit path as the parameters of the system are changed,
and a corresponding nonanalyticity of the activation energy. We also investigate the extent to which
the bifurcation is related to the local breaking of time-reversal invariance.

Noise-induced motion away from a locally stable state,
in a system far from thermal equilibrium, arises in di-
verse scientiﬁc contexts, e.g., glasses [1], arrays of Joseph-
son junctions [2], stochastically modeled computer net-
works [3], stochastic resonance [4], and stochastic ratch-
ets [5]. Because these systems in general lack detailed
balance, progress in understanding this phenomenon has
been slower than in thermal equilibrium systems. In par-
ticular, there exist no simple or general relations from
which the rate of noise-induced transitions between sta-
ble states can be obtained.

Recently, substantial progress on the nonequilibrium
case has been achieved in the limit of weak noise, us-
ing path integral or equivalent Hamiltonian formulations
[6–9]. Fluctuational motion of the system can then be
characterised by the pattern of optimal (i.e. most prob-
able) ﬂuctuational trajectories. An optimal trajectory
is one along which a system moves, with overwhelming
probability, when it ﬂuctuates away from a stable state
toward a speciﬁed remote state. These are rare events
but, when they occur, they do so in an almost determin-
istic way: e.g. escape from a domain of attraction typi-
cally follows a unique trajectory. The properties of this
most probable exit path (MPEP) determine the weak-
noise behaviour of the mean ﬁrst passage time (MFPT).
In recent years, it has been realized that in nonequilib-
rium systems, the pattern of optimal ﬂuctuational trajec-
tories may contain “focusing singularities” [9,10]. Their
eﬀect on exit phenomena was considered by Maier and
Stein [11,12] who showed that, for a symmetric double
well system (see below), the MPEP bifurcates when the
model parameters are changed in such a way that a fo-
cusing singularity appears along it. That is, the MPEP
ceases to be unique. This bifurcation breaks the sym-
metry of the model, and is accompanied by a nonan-
alyticity of the activation energy for inter-well transi-
tions: it is analogous to a second-order phase transition
in a condensed matter system [12]. This analogy throws
new light on, e.g., exit bifurcation phenomena in systems
driven by coloured noise [7].

1

Many of these theoretical ideas, although important,
remain untested experimentally or numerically. In this
Letter we use an analog experiment and numerical sim-
ulations to demonstrate the predicted bifurcation of the
MPEP, and the corresponding nonanalytic behavior of
the activation energy and related quantities. We inves-
tigate the nature of the broken symmetry in detail, and
show how bifurcation is accompanied by a loss of time-
reversal invariance along the MPEP.

We investigate the motion of an overdamped particle
in the two-dimensional drift ﬁeld ﬁrst proposed in [8]:
u(x, y) = (x − x3 − αxy2, −y − x2y), where α is a param-
eter. It has point attractors at (±1, 0) and a saddle point
at (0, 0). If the particle is subject to additive isotropic
white noise f (t) = (fx, fy), its position (x, y) will satisfy
the coupled Langevin equations

˙x = x − x3 − αxy2 + fx(t),
˙y = −y − x2y + fy(t),

(1)

hfi(t)i = 0,

hfi(s)fj (t)i = Dδij δ(s − t).

Since u is not a gradient ﬁeld (unless α = 1), the dy-
namics will not satisfy detailed balance. The Fokker–
Planck equation for the particle’s probability density
ρ = ρ(x, y, t) will be

˙ρ = (D/2)∇2ρ − ∇·(ρu).

(2)

In the weak-noise limit, escape of the particle from
the domain of attraction of either ﬁxed point (xs, 0) =
(±1, 0) is governed by the the slowest-decaying nonsta-
tionary eigenmode of the Fokker–Planck operator [13],
whose eigenvalue λ1 becomes exponentially small as
In this limit the MFPT htexiti is well ap-

−1
proximated by λ
1 . The slowest-decaying eigenmode is
called the quasistationary probability density; we denote
it by ρ1. It may be approximated in a WKB-like fash-
ion [8,11,12], i.e.,

ρ1(x, y) ∼ K(x, y) exp (−W (x, y)/D) ,

D → 0. (3)

Here W (x, y) may be viewed as a classical action at zero
energy, since it turns out to satisfy an eikonal (Hamilton–
Jacobi) equation of the form H(x, ∇W ) = 0, where
H(x, p) = 1
2 p2 + u(x) · p is a so-called Wentzel–Freidlin
Hamiltonian [14]. The optimal ﬂuctuational trajecto-
ries are projections onto coordinate space of the zero-
energy classical trajectories determined by this Hamilto-
nian. These lie on the three-dimensional energy surface
speciﬁed by H = 0, embedded in the four-dimensional
phase space with coordinates (x, y, px, py).
In general,
the computation of W (x, y) requires a minimisation over
the set of zero-energy trajectories starting at (xs, 0) and
terminating at (x, y). Moreover the MPEP, for the do-
main of attraction of (xs, 0), is the zero-energy trajectory
of least action which extends from (xs, 0) to the sad-
dle (0, 0). The MPEP action δW ≡ W (0, 0) − W (xs, 0)
governs the weak-noise behavior of the MFPT. To lead-
ing order it is of the activation type, i.e.,
htexiti ∼ const × eδW/D,

D → 0.

(4)

So δW is interpreted as an activation energy. The prefac-
tor ‘const’ is determined by the function K(x, y) of (3).
When α = 1, the dynamics of the particle satisfy de-
tailed balance, and the pattern of optimal trajectories
emanating from (xs, 0) contains no singularities. It was
found earlier [11,12] that, as α is increased, the ﬁrst fo-
cusing singularity on the MPEP (initially lying along the

x-axis) appears when α = αc ≡ 4.
pearance of a transverse ‘soft mode,’ or instability, which
causes the MPEP to bifurcate.
Its physical origin is
clear: as α is increased, the drift toward (xs, 0) ‘soft-
ens’ away from the x-axis, which eventually causes the
on-axis MPEP to split. The two new MPEP’s move oﬀ-
axis, causing the activation energy (previously constant)
to start decreasing. So the activation energy as a func-

substantially beyond αc, further bifurcations of the on-
axis zero-energy classical trajectory occur when α equals
α(j)
c ≡ (j + 1)2, where j is the number of the bifurcation.
But the oscillatory trajectories arising from such bifur-
cations are believed to be unphysical, since the on-axis
trajectory is no longer the MPEP. (Cf. [9].)

To test these theoretical predictions, and to seek fur-
ther insight into the nature of the broken symmetry, we
have built an analog electronic model of the system (1)
using standard techniques [15]. We drive it with zero-
mean quasi-white Gaussian noise from a noise-generator,
digitize the response x(t), y(t), and analyse it with a digi-
tal data processor. Transition probabilities are measured
by a standard level-crossing technique. Experimental in-
vestigations of the optimal ﬂuctuational trajectories are
based on measurements of the prehistory probability dis-
tribution [16,17]. This method was recently extended
to include analysis of relaxational trajectories and thus
to investigate directly the presence or absence of time-
reversal symmetry and detailed balance [18].

We have also carried out a complementary digital sim-
ulation of (1) using the algorithm of [19], with particular
attention paid to the design of the noise-generator on ac-
count of the long simulation times. Transition probabili-
ties were measured using a well-to-well method, and the
analysis of the data to extract the optimal ﬂuctuational
and relaxational trajectories was based on a method sim-
ilar to that used in the analog experiments.

Some activation energy results are shown in Fig. 1.
Part (a) plots the MFPT htexiti as a function of in-
verse noise intensity 1/D for the special case α = 1.
In this case the drift ﬁeld is the gradient of the potential
U (x, y) = (cid:0)y2(1 + x2) − x2 + x4/2(cid:1)/2, and W can be ob-
tained exactly (W = 2U ). The analog and digital results
are in good agreement, and demonstrate that the noise
dependence of the MFPT is indeed of the activation type
predicted by the theory. Activation energies determined
from the slopes of a series of plots like those in Fig. 1(a),
yielded the results shown in Fig. 1(b), where they are
compared with theoretical values of δW determined from
the true (least action) MPEP or MPEP’s [11,12]. At the
predicted critical value αc = 4, marked changes in both
the activation energy and MFPT prefactor (which → 0)

are evident: theory predicts that the activation energy bi-
furcates here into two values, corresponding to paths on
and oﬀ the x-axis, of which only the latter (lower action)
path is expected to be physically meaningful. The depen-
dence of the activation energy on α near the second crit-
ical value α(2)
c ≡ 9 is smooth, in agreement with the pre-
diction that higher bifurcations correspond to folding of
a nonphysical sheet of the ‘action surface’ W = W (x, y),
and are not observable [9,12].

Interestingly, the transition shown in Fig. 1(b) resem-
bles the bifurcation of the activation energy in an over-
damped oscillator driven by coloured noise [7]. This
suggests that the WKB analysis [11,12] of (1) may pro-
vide physical and topological insight into the correspond-
ing transition phenomena in systems driven by quasi-
monochromatic noise.

To verify experimentally the expected relationship be-
tween the bifurcation of the MPEP and the bifurcation of
the activation energy, we have measured two-dimensional
prehistory probability distributions [16] of ﬂuctuational

3

trajectories bringing the system into the vicinity of the
separatrix between the two wells (the y-axis). In the limit
of low noise intensity, the maxima of the corresponding
distributions trace out optimal trajectories [17,18]. The
positions of these maxima are compared to the calculated
MPEP’s for α = 6.67 in Fig. 2(a). It is clear that the
typical ﬂuctuational path corresponding to escape from
the domain of attraction of (xs, 0) follows very closely
one of the predicted MPEP’s.

To seek further experimental insight into the charac-
ter of the broken symmetry for the MPEP, we have also
followed the dynamics of the relaxational part of the es-
cape paths, after they have crossed the y-axis separa-
trix. The prehistory and relaxational probability distri-
butions provide a complete history of the time evolution
of large ﬂuctuations to and from a given remote state.
One can thus investigate experimentally detailed balance
and time-symmetry (or the lack of them) [18]. The posi-
tions of the maxima of the measured relaxational distri-
butions are compared with the corresponding theoretical
trajectories in Fig. 2(b). A detailed analysis of the distri-
butions will be given elsewhere. It can be seen from the
ﬁgure that for α > αc the MPEP breaks time-reversal
symmetry, i.e., the average growth and average decay of
ﬂuctuations [20] traced out by the ridges of the corre-
sponding distributions take place along trajectories that
are asymmetric in time. That is, for α > αc the MPEP
is not a time-reversed relaxational trajectory.

The inset in Fig. 2(b) shows the distribution of points
where the escape trajectories hit the y-axis separatrix
(i.e., the exit location distribution). Its shape is nearly
Gaussian, as expected from the saddle point approxima-
tion of [12]. The maximum is situated near the saddle
point clearly demonstrating that, in the limit of weak
noise, exit occurs via the saddle point.

The relationship between time-reversal symmetry-
breaking for the MPEP when α > αc, and symmetry-
breaking generally for the system (1), is quite subtle. The
system loses detailed balance and time reversal symmetry
as soon as α > 1 and the drift ﬁeld u becomes nongradi-
ent. It is on account of a special symmetry of the system
(reﬂection symmetry through the x-axis) that the MPEP
can remain unchanged in this nongradient drift ﬁeld up to
the value αc = 4. Thus, for 1 < α < 4 the dynamics of
the most probable ﬂuctuational trajectories is a mirror-
image of the relaxational dynamics only along the x-axis;
everywhere else in the domain of attraction of (xs, 0) the
outward optimal trajectories are not antiparallel to the
inward relaxational trajectories, and the resulting closed
loops enclose nonzero area [11,14].

This prediction has been tested experimentally by trac-
ing out optimal paths to/from speciﬁed remote states
both on and oﬀ the x-axis, for 1 < α < αc. Some re-
sults are shown in Fig. 3 for α = 3.5. It is evident that
the ridges of the ﬂuctuational (ﬁlled circles) and relax-
ational (pluses) distributions follow closely the theoreti-

cal curves. For an oﬀ-axis remote state (Fig. 3(a)), they
form closed loops of nonzero area, thus demonstrating
the expected rotational ﬂow of the probability current in
a nonequilibrium system [20]. The corresponding ridges
for an on-axis remote state (Fig. 3(b)) are antiparallel,
indicating that symmetry is preserved along the x-axis.
Our results verify the predicted bifurcation of the
MPEP in (1) at α = αc ≡ 4, with a corresponding nonan-
alyticity of the activation energy. We have demonstrated
that, in the limit D → 0, detailed balance and time-
reversal symmetry can be considered as local properties
along the MPEP of the system in the sense discussed
above, and that the bifurcation phenomenon can be
related to local time-reversal symmetry-breaking along
the MPEP: results that may bear on two-dimensional
stochastic ratchets [21] where symmetry plays an impor-
tant role. Having thus demonstrated (see also [17]) the
reality of phenomena inferred from D → 0 optimal paths,
we anticipate that other important D → 0 theoretical
predictions, e.g. “cycling” of the exit location distribu-
tion [22], will also be physically realisable.

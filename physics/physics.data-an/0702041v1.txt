Abstract

This paper evaluates the performance of boosted decision trees for
tagging b-jets. It is shown, using a Monte Carlo simulation of W H →
lνq ¯q events that boosted decision trees outperform feed-forward neural
networks. The results show that for a b-tagging eﬃciency of 90% the
b-jet purity given by boosted decision trees is almost 20% higher than
that given by neural networks.

1 Introduction

Precision measurements in the top quark sector, and searches for the Higgs
boson and physics beyond the Standard Model, critically depend on the good
identiﬁcation (“tagging”) of jets produced by b quarks. Tagging techniques
exploit speciﬁc properties of B-hadrons to diﬀerentiate them from the large
background of jets produced by light quarks and gluons. The long lifetime
of B-hadrons results in displaced vertices formed by tracks from their decays.
Physical observables associated to these vertices constitute the input for sec-
ondary vertex tagging. Also, tracks from B- and D-hadron decays typically
have large impact parameters, which are frequently used to construct discrim-
inating variables. In a diﬀerent approach, soft-lepton tagging searches for low
transverse momentum leptons inside jets, originating from semileptonic decays
of B- and D-hadrons. The tagging performance is substantially improved when
individual taggers are combined to give a single jet classiﬁer. In high energy
physics, the feed-forward neural network is one of the most popular methods
of combining several discriminating variables into one classiﬁer and have been
extensively applied to b-tagging.

In this paper, the capability of an alternative classiﬁcation technique, the
boosted decision trees, for tagging b-jets is evaluated. Using a sample of
W H → lνq ¯q Monte Carlo events, the performance of boosted decision trees
and feed-forward neural networks is compared. Boosted decision trees is a
learning technique recently introduced in high energy physics for data analysis
in the MiniBooNE experiment [1].
It was found that particle identiﬁcation
with boosted decision trees has better performance than that with neural net-
works in a Monte Carlo simulation of MiniBooNE data. This insight motivated
the studies reported here, which indicate that boosted decision trees is also a
promising technique for tagging b-jets.

In the next section, a brief description of the boosted decision trees algo-
rithm is given. The Monte Carlo simulation used in this analysis is explained
in Section 3. Section 4 describes the discriminant variables which feed the
tagging algorithms. The tagging performances of boosted decision trees and
neural networks are compared in Section 5. Finally, conclusions are given in
Section 6.

2 Boosted decision trees

The boosted decision trees algorithm implemented in this analysis starts with a
parent node containing a training set of b-jet and u-jet patterns. All jets in the
ﬁrst tree iteration are given the same weight w(0), such that the sum of weights
equals 1. Then, the algorithm loops over all binary splits in order to ﬁnd the
discriminating variable and corresponding separation value that optimizes a
given ﬁgure of merit. For instance, in Figure 1 the optimal ﬁgure of merit is
obtained when the jets are divided between those that have a secondary vertex
mass greater than 1 GeV/c2 and those that do not. This procedure is then
repeated for the new daughter nodes until a stopping criterion is satisﬁed.

A node is called “signal node” if the sum of the weights of b-jets is greater
than the sum of the weights of u-jets. Otherwise, it is called “background
node”. A b-jet (u-jet) is correctly classiﬁed if it lands on a signal (background)
node. If p designates the fraction of correctly classiﬁed jets in a node, its Gini
index is deﬁned to be Q(p) = −2p(1 − p). The optimal discriminating variable
and separation value are the ones which maximize the ﬁgure of merit

Qsplit =

wLQ(pL) + wRQ(pR)
wL + wR

,

(1)

where wL and wR are the sum of the jet weights in the left and right daughter
nodes, respectively, and Q(pL) and Q(pR) are the Gini indices of the left and
right daughter nodes. A node is not split if the optimal Qsplit is smaller than its

own Q(p), or, alternatively, if it contains less events than a prespeciﬁed limit.
Unsplit nodes are called “leafs”, which are depicted as rectangles in Figure 1.
After the kth tree is built, the jet weights are updated. There are several
methods to accomplish this. Here, we will consider the AdaBoost algorithm [2].
First, the total misclassiﬁcation error εk of the tree is calculated:

where i loops over all jets in the training sample and I (k)
is an indicator
function which is equal to 1 if the ith jet was misclassiﬁed or equal to 0 if
the ith jet was correctly classiﬁed. Then, the weights of misclassiﬁed jets are
increased (boosted)

Finally, the tree k + 1 is constructed using the new weights w(k+1).

After M trees are trained their performance can be evaluated with a testing
sample of jets. The ﬁnal score of jet i is a weighted sum of the scores over the

and f (k)
i = 1(−1) if the kth tree makes the jet land on a signal (background)
leaf. Therefore, b-jets will have large positive scores, while u-jets will have
large negative scores. Trees with lower misclassiﬁcation errors εk are given
more weight when the jet score is calculated. Further details of the AdaBoost
algorithm can be found in [3].

3 Monte Carlo simulation

The studies described in this paper were done with events generated with
PYTHIA 6.319 [4]. We considered the environment of the LHC collider, in
which pp interactions with a center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV are produced.
One of the benchmark channels for b tagging studies at the LHC is the associ-
ated W H production. We generated W H events with mH = 120 GeV/c2, the
W boson decaying semileptonically W → lν and the Higgs boson decaying to
quark pairs H → q ¯q. Initial and ﬁnal state radiation and multiple interactions
were included in the simulation.

Tracks are parametrized by the following set of 5 parameters: d0, z0, φ,
cot θ and 1/pT . The transverse impact parameter d0 is the distance of closest
approach of the track to the primary vertex in the plane perpendicular to the
beam-line. The longitudinal impact parameter z0 is the component along the
beam-line of the distance of closest approach. The parameters φ and θ are the
azimuthal and polar angles of the track, respectively, and 1/pT is the inverse
of the particle transverse momentum.

In order to simulate measurement errors, these parameters were smeared
with Gaussian resolution functions. The transverse and longitudinal impact
parameters were smeared with standard deviations σd0 = 10 µm and σz0 =
100 µm, the angle φ with σφ = 0.10 mrad, cot θ with σcot θ = 0.001 and the
inverse of the transverse momentum with σ1/pT = 0.001 GeV−1. The primary
vertex positions were smeared with Gaussian resolution functions with σx =
σy = 50 µm and σz = 100 µm. A jet is formed by all stable particles inside a

(∆φ)2 + (∆η)2 < 0.4 around its axis, where η = − log (tan(θ/2))

4 Discriminant variables

The physical observables used for discrimination between b-jets and light jets
are taken from well known “spatial” b-tagging algorithms. Physical observ-
ables from tagging techniques based on soft leptons are not considered in this
analysis. Only jets with pT > 10 GeV/c and |η| < 2.5 are considered taggable.

4.1

Impact parameter tag

Due to the long decay distances traveled by B-hadrons, tracks from b-jets
have on average larger impact parameters than tracks from light jets, since
sizeable impact parameters in light jets are exclusively due to measurement
errors. Therefore, the impact parameter of jet tracks can be used to build a
useful variable for discrimination between b-jets and light jets. Figure 2 shows
the distributions of (a) signed transverse impact parameter signiﬁcances Sd0 =
d0/σd0 and (b) signed longitudinal impact parameter signiﬁcances Sz0 = z0/σz0
of tracks in b-jets (solid line) and u-jets (dashed line). A positive (negative)
sign is assigned to the impact parameter if the track intersects the jet axis
in front (behind) of the primary vertex. These distributions give likelihood
functions b(S) and u(S) for a track to belong to a b-jet or a u-jet, respectively.
A jet weight is deﬁned as the sum of the log-likelihood ratio over all tracks in
the jet:

wjet =

Xi∈jet

ln

b(Si)
u(Si)(cid:19)

.

(cid:18)

(7)

In Figure 3 it is shown the distribution of jet weights for u and b quarks.
Because the transverse impact parameter has better resolution, it yields greater
discrimination power. A given eﬃciency for selecting b-jets is obtained by
selecting jets with weights above some threshold level. Obviously, for moderate
or high selection eﬃciencies there will always be some contamination with light
jets.

4.2 Secondary vertex tag

An alternative approach for building b tagging discriminating variables consists
in reconstructing displaced secondary vertex from B- and D-hadron decays in-
side the jet. Secondary vertices were reconstructed with Billoir and Qian’s fast
vertex ﬁtting algorithm [5]. For purposes of secondary vertex b-tagging the

exact topology of the secondary vertex is irrelevant and, therefore, an inclusive
vertex search is performed. All jet tracks with large transverse impact param-
eter signiﬁcance participate in the vertex ﬁt and vertices compatible with V 0
decays are rejected. Figure 4(a) shows the decay distance signiﬁcance for b-jets
and u-jets for good quality vertices. Besides the decay distance signiﬁcance,
other variables associated to the secondary vertex may have discrimination
power, such as the vertex mass (Figure 4(b)) and the ratio between the abso-
lute momentum sum of tracks in the secondary vertex and that of all tracks
in the jet (Figure 4(c)).

4.3 One-prong tag

For one-prong decays of B- and D-hadrons the secondary vertex ﬁt fails. In this
situation, though, some information can still be extracted from tracks in the
jet. For instance, the maximal transverse and longitudinal impact parameters

5 Results

Boosted decision trees were implemented using the StatPatternRecognition
package [3]. The trees were fed with the 7 discriminant variables mentioned in
the previous section and were trained with 50000 b-jet patterns and 50000 u-jet
patterns. An unbiased evaluation of the boosted decision trees performance is
obtained using a distinct sample of b-jets and u-jets patterns (testing sample).
The best results were obtained with a minimum number of jets per leaf of about
1000. The performance becomes better with increasing number of trees, but no
signiﬁcant improvement was observed after a few hundreds of tree iterations.

In order to compare the performance of boosted decision trees with the neu-
ral network approach, a feed-forward neural network was implemented using
the Multi-Layer Perceptron class [6] provided by the data analysis framework
ROOT [7]. The architecture of the network consisted of 7 nodes in the in-
put layer (corresponding to the 7 discriminant variables mentioned above), 8
nodes in a single hidden layer and 1 node in the output layer. The network was
trained with the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno learning method with a
learning rate parameter η = 0.1. The training set consisted of 100000 jet pat-
terns, of which 50000 were b-jets and 50000 were u-jets. Since the magnitude
of the discriminant variables diﬀer considerably, which may aﬀect the perfor-
mance of the neural network, all input variables were normalized. The number
of epochs (training cycles) was 200. Care was taken to prevent overtraining
the network by monitoring the evolution of the learning curve. Figure 6(b)
shows the jet scores given by the neural network for a testing sample of b-jet

decision trees relative to the neural network (few % increase) since the purity
given by both approaches is already very close the optimal value of 1. However,
for high b-tagging eﬃciencies, boosted decision trees clearly outperform neural
networks. For a b-tagging eﬃciency of 90%, the b-jet purity given by boosted
decision trees is almost 20% higher than that given by neural networks. Fur-

thermore, the level of purity given by boosted decision trees for an eﬃciency
of 90% can only be obtained with neural netwoks at the cost of a b-tagging
eﬃciency of about 70%. Also, the results indicate that virtually pure samples
of b-jets can be obtained for a b-tagging eﬃciency of 85%.

6 Conclusions

The studies presented in this paper indicate that boosted decision trees out-
perform neural networks for tagging b-jets, using a Monte Carlo simulation
of W H → lνq ¯q events, and sensible physical observables as discriminating
variables. For a b-tagging eﬃciency of 90%, the b-jet purity obtained with
boosted decision trees is almost 20% higher than that given by the neural net-
work approach. Although encouraging, these results should be complemented
with studies performed with a full simulation in which detector ineﬃciencies
are considered. Also, the relative performance of both techniques may diﬀer if
other physics channels are considered.

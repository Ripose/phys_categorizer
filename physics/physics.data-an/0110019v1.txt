This study investigates the modiﬁcations of the thermal spectrum, at low frequency,

induced by an external damping on a system in heat contact with internal ﬂuctuat-

ing impurities. Those impurities can move among locations and their oscillations are

associated with a loss function depending on the model.

The ﬂuctuation properties of the system are provided by a potential function shaped

by wells, in such a way that jumps between the stationary positions are allowed. The

power spectral density associated with this dissipation mechanism shows a f −

γ tail.

The interest of this problem is that many systems are characterized by a typical

f −

γ spectral tail at low frequency. The model presented in this article is based on a

threshold type behaviour and its generality allows applications in several ﬁelds.

The eﬀects of an external force, introduced to produce damping, are studied by

using both analytical techniques and numerical simulations.

The results obtained with the present model show that no reduction of the power

spectral density is appreciable below the main peak of the spectral density.

I. INTRODUCTION

Since gravitational wave interferometers will sense the passage of a gravitational wave as a diﬀerence

in the light path between mirrors in the two arms, every kind of excitation is a noise source. Cooling the

mirrors of these detectors, by measuring and controlling with a feedback loop the principal fundamental

motions that may be thermally excited, may oﬀer a means to reduce thermal noise.

With this motivation in mind, we investigated models that generate frequency spectra with a tail

0. This dependence is found in many completely diﬀerent physical systems, suggesting

a possible underlying simple mechanism. The typical physical parameters are diﬀerent for each of

them, and especially the characteristic microscopic quantities. But many classes of phenomena are

characterized by the same value of γ.

Indeed the responsive behaviour of every system is classiﬁed according to the parameters of the

phenomenological equations by which the main characteristics of its evolution and interactions are

described. Moreover the contribution of the microscopic degrees of freedom is absorbed in the deﬁnition

of the parameters so that it is possible to describe the motion of a system in terms of a phenomenologial

equation for the macroscopic degrees of freedom. The microscopic degrees of freedom motions are

integrated over as in averages and their eﬀect in the dynamics of the system is contained in the physical

constants. For example in high energy physics the masses are corrected for those particles which are

not isolated but interacting with other ones, and since measurements imply interactions, the measured

values are the renormalized values instead of the bare values. Similarly applications of those principles

may be found in low energy physics [1,2]. A typical example is the up-conversion of resonant frequencies,

related with a non-linear perturbation term that aﬀects both the bare value of the resonant frequency

and its width [3].

In this paper a very simple model is studied whose basic characteristic is the switching between

equilibrium conﬁgurations across energy barriers. There are no other requirements and this generality

is the main feature of this ﬂexible model that can be easily adapted for a lot of diﬀerent physical

phenomena. The principal interest has been the investigation of the inﬂuence on the spectral function

and particularly on the typical low frequency tail of a damping force.

II. THE MODEL

For those materials characterized by a quality factor that may be increased by decreasing the

amount of impurities, a reasonable picture is that the motion of those degrees of freedom may generate

a ﬂuctuation-dissipation process across the sites in the crystal.

In other words the impurities are

supposed to move following a random walk.

The energy of those impurities is related with their temperature; in cryogenic conditions they hardly

can pass through the potential barrier and change their location. The probability of a jump from one

site to another depends upon T . The system is characterized by its statistical properties and the

temperature is deﬁned as a stationary thermodynamical quantity.

A simple random walk model may be considered to represent the switching between the equilibrium

positions for a two well potential function

All the terms may be easily derived using the Feynman diagram technique. In this paper indeed the

analogies between a wave equation and a heat equation are used and the solution x′(f ) is represented

and expanded in a graphic way. The analogy with the Feynman diagram techniques is deﬁned by

associating a line with the Green’s function G(f ) and a cross with the force ξ(f ). When two crosses are

combined together a δ(f +f ′) arises. The iterative method of getting the terms of the expansion consists

of substituting for the solution in the implicit deﬁnition at any order, the expression corresponding to

the lower one in α′.

The Feynman diagrams are shown in Fig.2 with the graphic representation of the solution. When

depend on t if the conditions are stationary. In this context it should be reminded that the ﬂuctuation-

dissipation mechanism has been extended to the perturbed case. This generalization is to be intended

as a limit of the methods and it is based on the physical assumption that the results are slightly modiﬁed

as it is assumed in ﬁeld theory techniques.

where the ﬁrst line represents the graphs (0),(2) and (3) in Fig.2 and the corresponding contribution

modiﬁes the deﬁnitions of the parameters but does not introduce a diﬀerent dependence on time.

This means that the typical shape of the power spectral density is not changed excepted some small

corrections of its parameters.

The characteristics of the spectrum are indeed changed by the other contributions involving con-

volution integrals [6]. These terms correspond to the graphs (1) and (4) that introduce a new feature

in the shape of the spectrum.

Indeed, they modify the power spectral density at low frequency for

ω0
Q << ω << ω0. In this range the spectrum decreases with increasing ω. The spectral density changes

its shape when the value of various parameters is modiﬁed, but there is still a tail for that interval

falling as ω−

γ for 0 < γ < 2.

Moreover a new feature accounted for in the formula above is a new peak that is produced at a

frequency which is approximately twice the value of the main peak frequency. All these analytical

results are obtained using a perturbative method that assumes that the system is never very far from

5

the equilibrium conditions.

If the system is allowed to go back and forth between the two minima of the potential function, an

alternative approach is needed in order to simulate the dynamics of the system. A simulation code has

been carried out and used to analyse diﬀerent interesting cases.

The physical picture is that the impurity has some chance of oscillating between two equilibrium

positions acquiring energy from thermal excitations.

It may be pushed into one direction or the other isotropically and the representation of those

ﬂuctuations is simply given by the stochastic term.

If some kicks are in the same direction, energy is gained to overcome the potential barrier. This

model reproduces the competition between thermal excitation and maxima between wells in the po-

tential function. If the temperature is high the passage through the barrier has more probabilities to

occur as it might be expected since T is a statistical deﬁnition of energy.

At this point there is no straightforward way for keeping the damping term in the non-linear regime,

apart from making physical guesses about the type of damping process. Choosing other forms would

mean diﬀerent spectral densities since the dynamics would be diﬀerent.

The relation between the random force and the damping term that is deﬁned by the ﬂuctuation-

dissipation theorem in the linear approximation, has been used in the stochastic equation outside

the two regions near the minima as well.

It provides a solution whose distribution in stationary

conditions satisﬁes the Boltzmann one. In general the Langevin equation implemented in the simulation

code corresponds to a Fokker-Planck equation for the probability distribution that has the Boltzmann

distribution as its stationary solution. This is one of the motivations to keeping the same expressions

for the damping force and the random term in the non-linear case. The other motivation is that the

nature of the damping eﬀect is often deﬁned by the properties of the heat-bath rather than on the

mechanical characteristics of the physical system in contact with it. Another point worthy of noting

is that the natural scale for the x-axis is related with the magnitude of the ﬂuctuating forces. This is

why the variable x′ = x

III. SIMULATION AND NUMERICAL RESULTS

The analogy existing between the Schr¨oedinger equation and the Fokker-Planck equation can be

exploited and an algorithm may be written based on this similarity. In particular the drift term and the

diﬀusion term in the Fokker-Planck equation, play the same role of the potential function and kinetic

term in the Hamiltonian operator.

Using the same rules for path-integral calculations, the evolution operator may be factored in such

a way that successive steps are performed which make the system ﬂuctuate according to the diﬀusion

term or make a step according to the deterministic term.

Depending upon the required precision of the stepping in the simulated states of the system, a

particular number of intermediate steps is needed to make the system evolve from its state to the

successive one. This technique is simply an application of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀ formula to a

stochastic phenomenon [7,8].

Recall that large values of α′ imply high T or ﬂat wells. In this high energy regime, the dynamics

at low frequency are such that there is a constant trend as in harmonic oscillators damped by a viscous

force. In Fig.3 the spectral density is shown for α′ = 10. No tail is appreciated at low frequency.

If the value of α′ is decreased the shape of the potential function is deeply characterized by two well

deﬁned minima and this aﬀects the dynamics at low frequency where the trend of the power spectrum

S(f ) is not constant. On the contrary there is a slope at low frequency that in Fig.4 is quite visible

and ﬁtted with f −

1.3 for the speciﬁc case of α′ = 1. Indeed according to the tests I made using diﬀerent

values for the parameter α′ the low frequency tail has the form f −

γ with 0 < γ < 2.

The dynamical model we constructed shows a low frequency tail in its spectrum. How is this system

aﬀected by a frequency independent damping force? Will the low frequency tail be attenuated by this

external force? This system is a good candidate for investigation as the main fundamental modes are

easily detected and suppressed by actively feeding back to the resonant motion. The damping we will

use is an external viscous force proportional to ˙x′. Our aim is to ﬁnd out whether an external damping

mechanism can suppress S(f ) at low f .

Some problems are to be faced in numerical studies. The numerical ﬂuctuations in simulations are

7

the statistical errors that aﬀect the mean value. They are reduced by averaging over many sets of data

in order to reduce the deviations

The statistical ﬂuctuations are especially large at low frequency so that if we are interested in

obtaining a smooth curve with small error bars, many runs must be averaged over.

In Fig.5 the spectral density is shown when the damping is applied. Only one of the peaks is well

deﬁned and indeed it becomes sharper since the damping force limits the motion to small oscillations

around one of the minima of the potential function.

The situation at low frequency is more interesting. The values at f

0 are not aﬀected. In the

∼

range below the peak the low frequency tail is changed as f −

2. A similar trend may be obtained by

increasing the depth of the wells so that the motion is mostly conﬁned to oscillations inside one of the

wells.

Many models have been proposed which involve a tail f −

1, as it is typical of electronic circuits’

For mirrors the value of γ for a spectrum f −

γ is not certain. In fact, making experimental mea-

surements of the ﬂuctuations at low frequency is diﬃcult even for state-of-the-art optics reasearch.

For lack of oﬀ-resonance measurements linear equations have been studied with a complex elastic

The random-walk problem studied in this work focuses on only one property that is the existance

of more than one equilibrium conﬁguration. A similar model is used to reproduce the switching of

polymeric units between two positions which are energetically equivalent.

The simulation program has also been modiﬁed in order to investigate what may happen if there

are more than two minima for the potential function. Instead of the two wells, a periodic potential has

been studied giving the same results. In Fig.6 the spectra obtained for two values of α′ are shown. The

ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem is extended to the general case although it could only be applied in the

linear approximation near one of the minima of the potential function. Also x may be scaled in order

From the physical point of view a potential barrier is needed to represent the limits of the periodic

structure that otherwise would be inﬁnitely large, and this is not realistic.

In this case a normalized stationary solution of the Fokker-Planck equation is the corresponding

Boltzmann distribution which takes into account the modiﬁed potential function. In other words what

is needed is a diﬀerentiable term that provides V (x′)

We assumed that the size of the periodic structure is so large that no border condition aﬀects the

model.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

This unidimensional model is characterized by a tail at low frequency in its power spectral density

that is not modiﬁed even when a frequency independent damping force is applied.

The data are obtained from a time domain simulation. We have considered both a simple case for a

two wells potential function and the more general case of a periodic frame with oscillations between the

minima. The ﬂuctuating motion of the degree of freedom and the associated dissipation are a model

to produce a typical low frequency tail f −

γ in the power spectral density S(f ).

The slope of such low frequency tail can be tuned by varying the constants; it depends on the

competition between the temperature and the depth of the wells.

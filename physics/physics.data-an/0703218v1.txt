Abstract

Modular structure is ubiquitous in real-world complex networks. The detection of this

type of organization into modules gives insights in the relationship between topological

structure and functionality. The best approaches to the identiﬁcation of modular structure

are based on the optimization of a quality function known as modularity, which is a relative

quality measure for a partition of a network into modules or “communities”. Recently some

authors pointed out that the optimization of modularity has a resolution limit beyond which

no modular structure can be detected even though these modules might have own entity.

Here we reanalyze this problem and propose a method that allows for multiple resolution

screening of the modular structure, releasing the optimization of modularity from resolution

problems, and accessing to new scales of description of complex networks while preserving

the topological properties. The method has been applied to synthetic and real networks

obtaining successful results.

The main goal of the study of the statistical properties of complex networks in physics,

during the last years, has been to categorize them in a quest for universality classes, so

widespread in other areas of statistical physics. However, many of these studies disregarded

the substructure of networks in the analysis. In 2002, Girvan and Newman [1] highlighted

the property of community structure in complex networks focusing precisely in the level of

description of substructure, and proposed a method to detect it. This work opened a new

scenario that has deserved a lot of attention in recent years (for a review, see refs. [2] and

[3]), specially because the identiﬁed structures have meaning, they reveal information about

roles of groups of nodes. This is the case, for example in the worldwide airports network [4],

the WWW [5], biological networks [6, 7, 8], social networks [1, 9] and the Internet [10, 11],

among others. The information revealed by the community structure of networks can be

very valuable and make scientists aware of accuracy and reliability of the method used to

detect this substructure.

The most important advance about community detection from the hit in [1] was given

by the same authors in [12], proposing a quality measure, modularity (Q), that allows to

quantify the modular structure. Although the original work was devoted to the formulation

of this quality measure in unweighted networks, we will develop our work in the scope of

the extended deﬁnition of Q for weighted networks presented in [13]. Given a network parti-

tioned into communities, being Ci the module to which node i is assigned, the mathematical

deﬁnition of modularity is expressed in terms of the weighted adjacency matrix wij, that

represents the value of the weight in the link between nodes i and j (0 if no link exists), and

the strengths wi =

j wij as

P

Q =

1
2w

wij

wiwj
2w

−

(cid:17)

i,j (cid:16)
X

δ(Ci, Cj)

(1)

where the Kronecker delta function δ(Ci, Cj) takes the values, 1 if node i and j are into the

same module, 0 otherwise, and the total strength is 2w =

i wi. For unweighted networks

wi becomes the degree of node i, and w the total number of links of the network.

P

The modularity of a given partition is then, the probability of having edges falling within

groups in the network minus the expected probability in an equivalent (null case) network

with the same number of nodes, and edges placed at random preserving the nodes’ strength.

The larger the modularity the best the partitioning is, cause more deviates from the null

case. Note that the optimization of the modularity cannot be performed by exhaustive

2

search since the number of diﬀerent partitions are equal to the Bell or exponential numbers

[14], which grow at least exponentially in the number of nodes N.

Indeed, optimization

of modularity is a NP-hard (Non-deterministic Polynomial-time hard) problem [15]. As a

consequence heuristics for the optimization of modularity [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21] have become

the only feasible (in computational time), reliable and accurate method to detect modular

structure up to now.

Recently, Fortunato and Barthelemy [22] showed mathematically that the optimization

of modularity has a resolution limit, raising important concerns about the reliability of the

modules detected so far using this technique. Using a deﬁnition of module extracted from

the functional form of Eq. 1 they subscribe the possible existence of submodules, within the

modules obtained optimizing Eq. 1. The same limitation has been observed for other quality

functions diﬀerent from modularity [23].

Here we present a solution to this apparent problem that relies on two fundamental issues:

ﬁrst, the deﬁnition of module proposed by the authors, although plausible, is a necessary

condition but not suﬃcient for the modules obtained when optimizing Q, and second and

most important, we provide with a method that allows the full screening of the topological

structure at any resolution level using the original deﬁnition of Q.

I. MODULARITY AND THE NOTION OF MODULE REVISITED

In [22], the authors devise a deﬁnition of module embedded in the expression of modular-

ity. Rewriting Eq. 1 in terms of contribution of modules (or communities) instead of nodes

they have

m

Q =

wss
w −

ws
2w

2

(cid:16)

(cid:19)

(cid:17)

s=1 (cid:18)
X

where the sum is over the m modules of the partition, wss is the internal strength of module

s and ws the total strength of module s. For unweighted networks wss reduces to the number

of internal links and ws to the sum of degrees of the nodes in module s. The interpretation

of modularity does not change by this reordering of terms and is the same to that exposed

for Eq. 1. The authors in [22], extending the interpretation of Q to each module, conclude

that a module is a subgraph s satisfying

(2)

(3)

wss
w −

ws
2w

2

> 0

(cid:17)

(cid:16)
3

because in this situation the internal strength of the module is larger than the expected

internal strength in the same module for the null case.

We have experimentally checked (although not proved) in all networks used in the related

literature of community detection [3], that the optimal partition in terms of Q always satisﬁes

Eq. 3 for all modules, but the implication does not hold in the opposite direction. This is

stated in [22] demonstrating the exception, i.e. by analyzing particular conﬁgurations of

networks with groups of nodes satisfying Eq. 3 that can not be recovered when optimizing

Q. They also analyze why the optimization of Q can not resolve these modules and provide

with a limit for the internal strength of modules (resolution limit) that depends on the

global strength of the network. Below this limit modules can not be detected by modularity

optimization even though they can have own entity, i.e. they satisfy Eq. 3. Using the

argument in reverse it can be also stated that the optimization of Q can not resolve either

supermodules (modules bigger than those obtained at the optimal partition) satisfying Eq. 3.

Note that this ﬁnding does not imply that the optimization of modularity is useless, it is

only exposing that the optimization of modularity has a characteristic scale imposed by the

total strength of the network, and that, at this scale not all substructures (or superstructures)

satisfying Eq. 3 can be considered modules. Modules are, at this scale of description imposed

by the total strength, the result of the optimization of modularity, and the larger the value

of the modularity the better deﬁned modules are.

An illustrative metaphor for the phenomenon observed is provided by the famous paint-

ing by Daly entitled: Gala Contemplating the Mediterranean Sea Which at Twenty Meters

Becomes the Portrait of Abraham Lincoln [32]. Optimization of modularity provides in

complex networks with a tool that allows to ﬁnd the more contrasted modules at a ﬁxed

”distance” or scale. The lesson from the painting before is that at diﬀerent ”distances” or

scales new descriptions can arise.

II. TUNING THE RESOLUTION OF MODULARITY

In [22] the authors try to accede to other levels of description of complex networks, in

terms of modular structure, below the resolution limit of modularity in the following way:

they start by optimizing modularity by using simulated annealing [18], once the optimal

partition is obtained they isolate the modules and apply again the optimization of modularity

4

for each subnetwork disconnected from the rest. This experiment was conceived only to

demonstrate the existence of submodules within the modules obtained optimizing Q, but

not as a ﬁrm proposal of a method to determine diﬀerent levels of description of the modular

structure of the original network. The results, as the authors state, are not guaranteed to

represent substructure in the original network, although they checked that represent modules

according to Eq. 3. The method is ﬂaw because the submodules found inside each module

are biased when the interconnections to the rest of modules in the network are neglected, as

described in [21].

The solution we propose takes advantage of the main conclusion in [22], namely the

existence of a structural resolution limit that depends on the total strength 2w. For the case

study presented in [22], two identical modules with a single link connecting them to the rest

of the network and only one link connecting them to each other, the resolution limit states

that these modules will not be found, optimizing modularity, if their internal strengths is

wss <

w/2

1

−

p

(4)

(5)

even when they satisfy Eq. 3. In [22] the authors neglect the contribution

1 in the second

−

side of inequality Eq. 4, which is acceptable for large values of the total strength.

A possibility to skip this problem consists in to modify the quality measure as in [24, 25],

however the semantics of modularity is not preserved in those cases, and then the deﬁnition

of module also changes. The mathematical solution to this problem, if we wish still to use

modularity to detect modular structure, is to modify the total strength 2w. Let us assume

that we increase the strength of every node by a quantity say r, then Eq. 4 will read

wss <

(2w + Nr)

1
2

(cid:16)p

nsr

2

−

−

(cid:17)

where ns stands for the number of nodes in module s and N the number of nodes in the

network. The result of this prescription resulting in Eq. 5 is that by tuning the parameter r,

the example above (two identical modules with a single link connecting them to the rest of

the network and only one link connecting them to each other), can be separated optimizing

modularity, cause the growth of √r is slower than r. The interpretation is that at some

scale controlled by r both modules will be visible using optimal modularity.

5

III. TOPOLOGY REPRESENTED AT DIFFERENT SCALES

The problem with the “naive” solution proposed in the last section is that there is no

prescription about how to increase the strength of nodes without altering the topological

characteristics of the original network. We solve this problem by deﬁning a new graph with

associated weighted adjacency matrix Wr, from the original weighted adjacency matrix W

of the graph with entries wij, as follows

Wr = W + rI

(6)

where I is the identity matrix. In terms of graphs, this new matrix represents the original

network with self-loops of weight r (strictly speaking the new graph is known as a pseudo-

graph). Note that the prescription in Eq. 6 supposes a constant shift (translation) r of the

strength of each node.

The commonly analyzed structural characteristics of networks (strength distribution,

weighted clustering coeﬃcient, strength correlations of any order, etc.) remain the same

in the new network because the translation of strengths does not aﬀect the original links’

weights wij that are the building blocks of the topology. The shift only aﬀects the property

of each node individually and in the same way for all them. The spectra of the original

graph is also shifted a quantity r for each eigenvalue, preserving then any property that

depends on diﬀerences between eigenvalues. The eigenvectors are exactly the same. Finally,

the associated laplacian matrix of the original matrix Lij = wiδij

wij, responsible for the

−

behavior of linear dynamical processes on the network [26], is also unchanged.

The interesting property of the new network Wr is that its characteristic scale in terms of

modularity has changed. Then the topological structure revealed by optimizing modularity

for Wr has a new resolution limit, lower if r > 0 or higher if r < 0, than the original, as

stated in Eq. 5. This fact allows for the screening of the modular structure by analyzing the

optimal modular structure of Wr for diﬀerent values of r. Moreover, the process ensures

that the topology we are investigating at each r is exactly the same to the original one, but

ﬁxing attention to a new level of description.

6

IV. MULTIPLE RESOLUTION LEVELS OF MODULARITY

The analysis of modules at diﬀerent resolution levels consists into optimize the modularity

of the graph Wr for diﬀerent values of r. Denoting Qr the modularity of the network at

scale r we have the equivalent to Eq. 2

Qr =

m

s=1  
X

2wss + nsr
2w + Nr −

ws + nsr
2w + Nr

(cid:18)

2

!

(cid:19)

(7)

where ns is the number of nodes in module s.

The topological scale determined by maximizing Q at which the detection of modular

structure has been attacked so far, corresponds to r = 0. For positive values of r, we have

access to the substructure underneath those at r = 0, and for negative values of r we have

access to the superstructures. The topological scale corresponding to all nodes separated

(forming their own communities) is found by maximizing Q(rmax) , where rmax is the smallest
positive value of r that satisﬁes wij < (wi+r)(wj +r)

2w+N r
corresponding to a unique module formed by the whole network is found by maximizing

= j. And the topological scale

for all i

Q(rmin), where rmin has a lower bound deﬁned by the asymptote rasymp =

2w
N . At the
asymptote the total strength is zero, thus no meaningful scales can be found for values of r
below it. Note that the mean strength can be written as 2w+N r

−

rasymp.

N = r

−

To compare results at diﬀerent resolution, we adopt the usual formulation in other areas

of physics (optics, acoustics, etc.) where scales are prescribed as the logarithm of the ratio

between the relevant parameter. Here, the diﬀerence between scales, is measured as the
logarithm of the ratio between strengths log( 2w+N r
2w+N r′ )

log( r−rasymp
r′−rasymp

).

≡

In this new description, we have that a module is deﬁned at each scale of description r,

as the result of the maximization of Qr. Moreover, modules that exist at a certain level

of description may disappear from our observation when changing the scale r while others

arise. Note that nothing implies that the substructures to which we will have access at

diﬀerent resolution levels are necessarily hierarchical, indeed in general they will not be

hierarchical. Although, in principle, any resolution scale is equivalent to any other, the

detection of partitions that are more persistent than the rest when changing the resolution

r is indicative of a tougher modular structure.

We show the results of our method investigating the modular structure at multiple reso-

lution levels (diﬀerent scales), for examples of synthetic and real complex networks. A ﬁrst

7

6
approach on synthetic networks is illustrative for validation of the procedure when diﬀerent

coexistent topological scales have been imposed by construction. For each experiment we

have screened between 100 and 500 values of r in the interval (rasymp, rmax] in synthetic net-

works, and 1000 values of r in real networks. All experiments have been crosschecked using

two modularity optimization procedures: extremal optimization [19] and simulated anneal-

ing [18], repeating each one 20 times and keeping the partition obtained at the optimal value

of Qr.

1. Synthetic Structured Networks

First we have computed the modular structure in a synthetic hierarchical scale-free com-

plex model network proposed by Ravasz and Barabasi [27].

In Fig. 1A we have plotted

the number of modules found at diﬀerent scales for the network model with 125 nodes

(RB125), and the partitions obtained at certain relevant resolution levels. The modular

structure found shows three diﬀerent scales that deserve discussion, we observe clearly per-

sistent structures in ﬁve and twenty-ﬁve communities respectively, that account for the

subdivisions more signiﬁcant in the process, showing two hierarchical levels for the struc-

ture. Additionally, the most stable partition in terms of resolution does not correspond to

the previous ones, it corresponds to the partition of 25 plus the hub isolated as a module.

In Fig. 1A the partition in 5 modules and the partition in 26 modules are highlighted on the

original network. This result is in perfect correspondence with the synchronization patterns

produced on this network using coupled oscillators [26].

Another network example used is the H 13-4 network that corresponds to a homogeneous

in degree network with two predeﬁned hierarchical community levels, being 256 the number

of nodes, 13 the number of links of each node with the most internal community (formed by

16 nodes), 4 the number of links with the most external community (four groups of 64 nodes)

and 1 more link with any other node at random in the network as in [26]. In Fig. 1B we

represent the network and its corresponding modular structure at diﬀerent scales. Again the

method reveals the hierarchy prescribed at diﬀerent scales of resolution, the ﬁrst hierarchical

level (4 groups of 64 nodes) and the second (16 groups of 16 nodes), as it corresponds to the

original construction of the network.

Finally, we have used the FB network proposed by [22] to demonstrate the resolution

8

limit of modularity (at r = 0). It consists in two cliques of 20 nodes linked with two small

cliques of ﬁve nodes. At r = 0 the best partition can not separate the two small cliques.

In Fig. 1C we observe that the partition searched by the authors, corresponding to the one

formed by the 4 cliques isolated in their own communities, is obtained by increasing the

resolution r, showing that the resolution limit of modularity is overcome by the method.

2. Real Networks

We have also analyzed the modular structure of real complex networks. In general in

this cases, the results are more diﬃcult to assess because nothing a priori from the topology

indicates the existence of more relevant structure or substructure in the network, and only

the corroboration a posteriori of the structure found with known facts about the (social,

biological, etc.) meaning of it could give reliability to any method.

We have focussed our study on a couple of social networks for which explicit knowledge

about its modular structure is available. These particular networks, formed by social ac-

quaintances between individuals, have the main characteristic that after a period of study

decomposed in perfectly identiﬁable parts. The challenge is to ﬁnd the modular structure

of these parts without previous knowledge about the real partition. The optimization of

modularity at r = 0 fails to provide this information, no other method has been able to ﬁnd

the real partitioned structure, however the most representative scales in terms of resolution

optimizing Qr obtained by applying our method correspond exactly to the real splittings.

We ﬁrst investigate the classical social network of the Zachary’s karate club [28] account-

ing for the study over two years of the friendships between 34 members of a karate club

at a US university in the 1970. The network in question was divided, at the end of the

study period, in two groups after a dispute between the administrator of the club and the

club’s instructor, which ultimately resulted in the instructor’s leaving and starting a new

club, taking about a half of the original club’s members with him, see Fig. 2A. The analysis

of this data has been a paradigmatic benchmark to test the accuracy of community detec-

tion algorithms. Zachary constructed a weighted network using diﬀerent social measures,

although many times in the physics literature the network has been considered unweighted

for simplicity or tradition, missing important information in the process.

The goal of any community detection algorithm trying to identify modules on this network

9

should be to ﬁnd the actual split occurred, assigning perfectly the nodes to the known

two resulting clubs. The ﬁrst approach to this goal was given by Girvan and Newman

in [1], they used a divisive method that produces a hierarchical tree representing the whole

modular structure. They found that the ﬁrst network splitting found by the method assigned

correctly all nodes except node 3. However, no measure about the quality of the partition

was introduced at that time, and then all levels of the hierarchical tree were equivalent,

with no way to have a preference for any partition. In [12], the same authors introduced the

modularity measure Q and reported the best structure in the hierarchy in terms of the value

of Q resulting in a partition in four groups, not two as expected. From this point on, many

authors have analyzed this network and provided the best values of Q obtained. Today it

is well accepted that the best partition in terms of modularity of the Zachary’s unweighted

network is achieved for four groups with a value of Q = 0.419. We have applied our method

to screen the modular structure of the original weighted network at all resolution scales r.

The results in Fig. 2A show that the most stable level of resolution is precisely the partition

resulting in the two groups representing the two clubs, with no mismatch of any individual.

The second network analyzed is the dolphin social network of Lusseau et al. [29]. The net-

work we study was constructed from observations of a community of 62 bottlenose dolphins

over a period of seven years from 1994 to 2001. Nodes in the network represent the dolphins

and ties between nodes represent associations between dolphin pairs occurring more often

than expected by chance. There is evidence that a temporary disappearance of the dolphin

denoted SN100, led to the ﬁssion of the dolphin community in two identiﬁable parts [30],

see Fig. 2B. The optimization of modularity at r = 0 does not produce the expected split

but a partition in ﬁve communities with Q = 0.518, other approaches as the one exposed in

[31] neither successes to ﬁnd the real division. Our method allows to reveal all the modular

structural in the whole range of resolution, indicating that the most stable solution in terms

of resolution of optimal Qr corresponds exactly to the two partitions observed in this animal

social network.

With these results we have solved, once for all, the problem of determining the modular

structure in the two social networks analyzed.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have reanalyzed the problem of modular structure detection in complex networks

using modularity. Motivated by the recent ﬁnding by Fortunato and Barthelemy [22],

demonstrating that the optimization of modularity has a resolution limit, related to the

characteristic scale imposed by the total strength (sum of weights) of the network, we pro-

pose a multiple resolution procedure that allows the optimization of modularity process to

go deep in to the structure. The main idea consists in to deﬁne a new graph from the

original by providing each node with a self-loop of the same magnitude r. The new graph

presents the same characteristics that the original graph in terms of connectivity but al-

lows the search of modules at diﬀerent topological scales by tuning the resolution in r. We

have provided examples of the modular substructure found in synthetic and real complex

networks. The results are sets of partitions that screen the full range of structural modules

from individual nodes up to the whole network in each particular topology. The analysis

of the results reveal that some topological scales are more persistent (stable) in terms of

resolution than others. These stable scales provide with very relevant information about the

main modular aspects of the structure: in the synthetic networks analyzed, they correspond

to the predeﬁned structural scales imposed ad hoc, and in real networks they correspond

exactly to previous knowledge of the networks, that has not been recovered by any other

method studying these network topologies up to now. With this method, we release opti-

mization of modularity from resolution problems. Moreover, the deﬁnition of module is the

result of this optimization at diﬀerent scales and consequently scale-dependent.

Fig. 1: Multiple resolution of modular structure in synthetic networks. We have screened

the whole range of topological scales for three synthetic networks (see text for details)

representing: the number of modules obtained at the optimal partition for Qr (each point

corresponds to a diﬀerent partition), and the network analyzed highlighting the partition

at some representative scales indicated by (I) and (II). The arrow indicates the optimal

partition at r = 0 traditionally attacked so far. A Network RB125 corresponding to the

hierarchical scale-free network proposed in [27]. The regions corresponding to 5, 25 and 26

modules are the most representative (stable) in terms of resolution. Regions (I) and (II)

are highlighted on the network. While the partitions in 5 and 25 are the expected from

construction, the more stable partition in 26 modules (same as the one at 25 but isolating

the hub), corresponds precisely with the partition observed in patterns of synchronization

dynamics on this network [26]. B H 13-4 corresponds to a homogeneous in degree network

with two predeﬁned hierarchical levels. Both hierarchical levels are revealed by the method

at diﬀerent scales. C FB corresponds to the network proposed by [22] to demonstrate the

resolution limit of modularity (at r = 0). This limit is overcome at scale (II) providing with

the partition expected by the authors in [22].

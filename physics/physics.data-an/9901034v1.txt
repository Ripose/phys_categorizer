Abstract

It is shown that prize changes of the US dollar - German Mark ex-
change rates upon diﬀerent delay times can be regarded as a stochastic
Marcovian process. Furthermore we show that from the empirical data
the Kramers-Moyal coeﬃcients can be estimated. Finally, we present an
explicite Fokker-Planck equation which models very precisely the empirical
probabilitiy distributions.

Since high-frequency intra-day data are available and easy to access, research
on the dynamics of ﬁnancial markets is enjoying a broad interest.
[1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7]. Well-founded quantitative investigations now seem to be feasible. The
identiﬁcation of the underlying process leading to heavy tailed probability density
function (pdf) of price changes and the volatility clustering (see ﬁg.1) are of special
interest. The shape of the pdf expresses an unexpected high probability of large
price changes on short time scales which is of utmost importance for risk analysis.
In a recent work [8], an analogy between the short-time dynamics of foreign
exchange (FX) market and hydrodynamic turbulence has been proposed. This
analogy postulates the existence of hierarchical features like a cascade process
from large to small time scales in the dynamics of prices, similar to the energy
cascade in turbulence c.f. [9]. This postulate has been supported by some work
[7] and questioned by others [6].

One main claim of the hypothesis of cascade processes is that the statistics of
the time series of the ﬁnancial market can be determined. The aim of the present
paper is to discuss a new kind of analysis capable to derive the underlying math-
ematical model directly from the given data. This method yields an estimation
of an eﬀective stochastic equation in the form of a Fokker-Planck equation (also
known as Kolmogorov equation). The solutions of this equation yields the prob-
ability distributions with suﬃcient accuracy (see ﬁg. 1). This means that our
method is not based on the conventional phenomenological comparison between
models and several stochastic aspects of ﬁnancial data. Our approach demon-
strates how multiplicative noise and deterministic forces interact leading to the
heavy tailed statistics. [10]

Recently it has been demonstrated that from experimental data of turbulent
ﬂow the hierarchical features induced by the energy cascade can be extracted in
form of a Fokker-Planck equation for the length scale dependence of velocity ﬂuc-
tuations [12]. In the following it will be shown the dynamics of foreign exchange
rates can also be described by a Fokker-Planck equation. Here we use a data set
consisting of 1,472,241 quotes for US dollar-German mark exchange rates from
the years 1992 and 1993 as used in reference [8].

We investigate the statistical dependence of prize changes ∆xi := x(t+ ∆ti)
−
x(t) upon the delay time ∆ti. Here x(t) denotes the exchange rate at time t. We
will show that the prize changes ∆x1, ∆x2 for two delay times ∆t1, ∆t2 are
∆t1 is not too large and
statistically dependent, provided the diﬀerence ∆t2 −
that the shorter time interval is nested inside the longer one.

In order to characterize the statistical dependency of price changes ∆xi, we

have evaluated the joint probability density functions

p(∆x2, ∆t2; ∆x1, ∆t1)

(1)

for various time delays ∆t2 < ∆t1 directly from the given data set. One example
of a contourplot of the logarithms of these functions is exhibited in ﬁgure 2. If the
two price changes ∆x1, ∆x2 were statistically independent, the joint pdf would
factorize into a product of two probability density functions:

p(∆x2, ∆t2; ∆x1, ∆t1) = p(∆x2, ∆t2)p(∆x1, ∆t1).

(2)

The tilted form of the probability density p(∆x2, ∆t2; ∆x1, ∆t1) clearly shows
that such a factorization does not hold and that the two price changes are
statistically dependent. This dependency is in accordance with observations
of M¨uller et al.
for cross-correlation functions of the same data [5]. To an-
alyze these correlations in more detail, we address the question: What kind
of statistical process underlies the price changes over a series of nested time
delays ∆ti of decreasing length?
In general, a complete characterization of
the statistical properties of the data set requires the evaluation of joint pdfs
pN (∆x1, ∆t1; ....; ∆xN , ∆tN ) depending on N variables (for arbitrarily large N).

Friedrich, Peinke, Renner

In the case of a Markov process (a process without memory), an important simpli-
ﬁcation arises: The N-point pdf pN are generated by a product of the conditional
∆xi, ∆ti), for i = 1, ..., N
probabilities p(∆xi+1, ∆ti+1|

tion, the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation [13]

should hold for any value of ∆ti embedded in the interval

∆t2 < ∆t3 < ∆t1

.

We checked the validity of the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation for diﬀerent
∆ti triplets by comparing the directly evaluated conditional probability distribu-
∆x1, ∆t1) with the ones calculated (pcal) according to (3). In
tions p(∆x2, ∆t2|
ﬁgure 3, the contour lines of the two corresponding pdfs are superimposed for
the purpose of illustration; the red lines corresponding to pcal. Only in the outer
regions, there are visible deviations probably resulting from a ﬁnite resolution of
the statistics.

As it is well-known, the Chapman-Kolmogorov [13] equation yields an evo-
lution equation for the change of the distribution function p(∆x, ∆t) across the
scales ∆t.

For the following it is convenient (and without loss of generality) to consider

a logarithmic time scale

τ =

ln∆t

Then, the limiting case ∆t
. The Chapman-
Kolmogorov equation formulated in diﬀerential form yields a master equation,
which can take the form of a Fokker-Planck equation (for a detailed discussion
we refer the reader to [13]):

The drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients D(1)(∆x, τ ), D(2)(∆x, τ ) can be estimated di-
rectly from the data as moments M (k) of the conditional probability distributions
(c.f ﬁg. 3):

As indicated by the functional ∆x dependency of the moments M (k), it turns out
that the drift term D(1) is a linear function of ∆x, whereas the diﬀusion term

D(2) is a function quadratic in ∆x. In fact, from a careful analysis of the data
set we obtain the following approximation:

D(1) =
0.44∆x

D(2) = 0.003 exp (

τ /2) + 0.019(∆x + 0.04)2

(8)

(∆x is measured in units of the standard deviation of ∆x at ∆t = 40960s).
With these coeﬃcients we can solve the Fokker-Planck equation (6) for the pdf
at times τ > τ0 with a given distribution at τ0. Figure 1 shows that the solutions
of our model nicely ﬁt the experimentally determined pdf’s [14]. In contrast to
the use of phenomenological supposed ﬁtting functions c.f [8, 2], we obtained the
changing forms of the pdfs by a diﬀerential equation. This method provides the
evolution of pdfs from large time delays to smaller ones. This deﬁnitely is a new
quality in describing the hierarchical structure of such data sets. At last, it is
important to note that our ﬁnding of the Fokker-Planck equation for the cascade
is in good agreement with the previously found phenomenological description in
[8]. Based on the given exact solution of our Fokker-Planck equation [11], we see
that the chosen type of ﬁtting function for the pdfs in [8] was the correct one.
Furthermore, we see that the observed quadratic dependency of the diﬀusion term
D2 corresponds to the found logarithmic scaling of the intermittency parameter
in [8], which was taken as an essential point to propose the analogy between
turbulence and the ﬁnancial market.

We remind the reader that the Fokker-Planck equation is equivalent to a

Langevin equation of the form (we use the Ito interpretation [13]):

In our approximation (8) the stochastic process underlying the prize changes is
a linear stochastic process with multiplicative noise, at least for large values of
∆x:

∆x(τ ) =

0.44∆x(τ ) + √.019∆x(τ )F (τ )

This stochastic equation yields realizations of prize changes ∆x(τ ), whose ensem-
ble averages can be described by the probability distributions p(∆x, τ ). Thus, the
Langevin equation (9) produces the possibility to simulate the price cascades for
time delays from about a day down to several minutes. Furthermore, with this
last presentation of our results it becomes clear that we are able to separate the
deterministic and the noisy inﬂuence on the hierarchical structure of the ﬁnance
data in terms of the coeﬃcients D(1) and D(2), respectively.

Summarizing, it is the concept of a cascade in time hierarchy that allowed us to
derive the results of the present paper, which in turn quantitatively supports the
initial concept of an analogy between turbulence and ﬁnancial data. Furthermore,
we have shown that the smooth evolution of the pdfs down along the cascade
towards smaller time delays is caused by a Markov process with multiplicative
noise.

by a the Fokker-Planck equation may only be an approximate one, since the
sample paths need not be continuous functions in time. In this more general

care of ﬁnite size jumps [13].

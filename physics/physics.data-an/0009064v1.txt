Abstract

A numerical procedure is developed for construction of conﬁdence intervals for parameter

of Poisson distribution for signal in the presence of background which has Poisson

distribution with known value of parameter.

Keywords: statistics, conﬁdence intervals, Poisson distribution, Gamma distribution,

sample.

I. INTRODUCTION

In paper [1] the uniﬁed approach to the construction of conﬁdence intervals and conﬁ-

dence limits for a signal with a background presence, in particular for Poisson distributions,

has been proposed. The method is widely used for the presentation of physical results [2]

though a number of investigators criticize this approach [3]

In present paper we propose a simple method for construction of conﬁdence intervals for

parameter of Poisson distribution for signal in the presence of background which has Poisson

distribution with known value of parameter. This method is based on the statement [4] that

the true value of parameter of the Poisson distribution in the case of observed number of

events ˆx has a Gamma distribution. In contrast to the approach proposed in [1], the width

of conﬁdence intervals in the case of ˆx = 0 is independent on the value of the parameter of

the background distribution.

In Section 2 the method of construction of conﬁdence intervals for parameter of Poisson

distribution for signal in the presence of background which has Poisson distribution with

known value of parameter is described. The results of conﬁdence intervals construction and

their comparison with the results of uniﬁed approach are also given in the Section 2. The

main results of this note are formulated in the Conclusion.

II. THE METHOD OF CONSTRUCTION OF CONFIDENCE INTERVALS

Assume that in the experiment with the ﬁxed integral luminosity (i.e. a process under

study may be considered as a homogeneous process during given time) the ˆx events of some

Poisson process were observed.

It means that we have an experimental estimation ˆλ(ˆx)

of the parameter λ of Poisson distribution. We have to construct a conﬁdence interval

(ˆλ1(ˆx), ˆλ2(ˆx)), covering the true value of the parameter λ of the distribution under study

with conﬁdence level 1 − α, where α is a signiﬁcance level. It is known from the theory of

statistics [5], that the mean value of a sample of data is an unbiased estimation of mean

of distribution under study. In our case the sample consists of one observation ˆx. For the

discrete Poisson distribution the mean coincides with the estimation of parameter value,

i.e. ˆλ = ˆx in our case. As it is shown in ref [4] the true value of parameter λ has Gamma

distribution Γ1,ˆx+1, where the scale parameter is equal to 1 and the shape parameter is equal

to ˆx + 1, i.e.

P (λ|ˆx) =

λˆx
ˆx!

e−λ.

(2.1)

Let us consider the Poisson distribution with two components: signal component with

a parameter λs and background component with a parameter λb, where λb is known. To

construct conﬁdence intervals for parameter λs of signal in the case of observed value ˆx we

must ﬁnd the distribution P (λs|ˆx).

2

At ﬁrst let us consider the simplest case ˆx = ˆs + ˆb = 1. Here ˆs is a number of signal

events and ˆb is a number of background events among observed ˆx events.

The ˆb can be equal to 0 and to 1. We know that the ˆb is equal to 0 with probability

p0 = P (ˆb = 0) =

λ0
b
0!

e−λb = e−λb

and the ˆb is equal to 1 with probability

p1 = P (ˆb = 1) =

λ1
b
1!

e−λb = λbe−λb.

(2.2)

(2.3)

Correspondingly, P (ˆb = 0|ˆx = 1) = P (ˆs = 1|ˆx = 1) =

P (ˆs = 0|ˆx = 1) =

p1

p0 + p1

.

p0

p0 + p1

and P (ˆb = 1|ˆx = 1) =

It means that distribution of P (λs|ˆx = 1) is equal to sum of distributions

P (ˆs = 1|ˆx = 1)Γ1,2 + P (ˆs = 0|ˆx = 1)Γ1,1 =

p0

p0 + p1

Γ1,2 +

p1

p0 + p1

Γ1,1,

(2.4)

where Γ1,1 is Gamma distribution with probability density P (λs|ˆs = 0) = e−λs and Γ1,2 is

Gamma distribution with probability density P (λs|ˆs = 1) = λse−λs. As a result we have

P (λs|ˆx = 1) =

λs + λb
1 + λb

e−λs .

(2.5)

Using formula (2.5) for P (λs|ˆx = 1) we construct the shortest conﬁdence interval of any

conﬁdence level in a trivial way [4].

In this manner we can construct the distribution of P (λs|ˆx) for any values of ˆx and λb.

We have obtained the formula

P (λs|ˆx) =

e−λs .

The numerical results for the conﬁdence intervals and for comparison the results of

paper [1] are presented in Table 1 and Table 2.

It should be noted that in our approach the dependence of the width of conﬁdence

intervals for parameter λs on the value of λb in the case ˆx = 0 is absent. For ˆx = 0 the

method proposed in ref. [6] also gives a 90% upper limit independent of λb.

III. CONCLUSION

In this note the construction of classical conﬁdence intervals for the parameter λs of Pois-

son distribution for the signal in the presence of background with known value of parameter

λb is proposed. The results of numerical construction are presented.

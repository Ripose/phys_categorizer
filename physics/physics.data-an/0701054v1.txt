Abstract. We study the level spacing distribution p(s) in the spectrum of random
networks. According to our numerical results, the shape of p(s) in the Erd˝os-R´enyi
(E-R) random graph is determined by the average degree hki, and p(s) undergoes
a dramatic change when hki is varied around the critical point of the percolation
transition, hki = 1. When hki >> 1, the p(s) is described by the statistics of
the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE), one of the major statistical ensembles
in Random Matrix Theory, whereas at hki = 1 it follows the Poisson level spacing
distribution. Closely above the critical point, p(s) can be described in terms of
an intermediate distribution between Poisson and the GOE, the Brody-distribution.
Furthermore, below the critical point p(s) can be given with the help of the regularised
Gamma-function. Motivated by these results, we analyse the behaviour of p(s) in
real networks such as the Internet, a word association network and a protein protein
interaction network as well. When the giant component of these networks is destroyed
in a node deletion process simulating the networks subjected to intentional attack, their
level spacing distribution undergoes a similar transition to that of the E-R graph.

Spectral transitions in networks

1. Introduction

2

A wide class of complex systems occurring from the level of cells to society can be
described in terms of networks capturing the intricate web of connections among the
units they are made of. Whenever many similar objects in mutual interactions are
encountered, these objects can be represented as nodes and the interactions as links
between the nodes, deﬁning a network. The world-wide-web, the science citation index,
and biochemical reaction pathways in living cells are all good examples of complex
systems widely modeled with networks, and the set of further phenomena where the
network approach can be used is even more diverse. Graphs corresponding to such
real networks exhibit unexpected non-trivial properties, e.g., new kinds of degree
distributions, anomalous diameter, spreading phenomena, clustering coeﬃcient, and
correlations [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. In most cases, the overall structure of networks reﬂect the
characteristic properties of the original systems, and enable one to sort seemingly very
diﬀerent systems into a few major classes of stochastic graphs [3, 4]. These developments
have greatly advanced the potential to interpret the fundamental common features of
such diverse systems as social groups, technological, biological and other networks.

Another general approach to the analysis of complex systems is provided by Random
Matrix Theory (RMT), originally proposed by Wigner and Dyson in 1967 for the study of
the spectrum of nuclei [6]. Since then, RMT has been successfully used in investigations
ranging from the studies of phase transitions in disordered systems [7], through the
spectral analysis of chaotic systems [8] and the stock market [9] to the studies of
brain responses [10]. Recently, the network approach to complex systems and the
RMT were combined in the analysis of the modular structure of biological networks
[11]. Network modules, also called as communities, cohesive groups, clusters, etc.
correspond to structural sub-units, associated with more highly interconnected parts,
with no unique deﬁnition [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. Such
building blocks (functionally related proteins [26, 27], industrial sectors [28], groups of
people [19, 29], cooperative players [30, 31], etc.) can play a crucial role in forming
the structural and functional properties of the involved networks, therefore there has
been a quickly growing interest in the last few years in developing eﬃcient methods for
locating these modules. One of the most well known community ﬁnding algorithm today
is the Girvan-Newman algorithm [13, 15], which is based on recursive deletion of links
with the highest betweenness. This process leads to splitting of the network to smaller
parts, corresponding to the communities, and the deletion of the links is stopped, when
optimal modularity is reached.

In the analysis of a protein-protein interaction network and a metabolic network,
Luo et al. found that the ﬂuctuations of the level spacing in the spectrum obey diﬀerent
statistics when the networks are split to the communities given by the Girvan-Newman
algorithm compared to the original state [11].
(The spectrum of a network is given
by the eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix [32, 33, 34]). For both networks, in the
original state the ﬂuctuations of the level spacing followed the statistics of the Gaussian

Spectral transitions in networks

Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE), one of the major statistical ensembles in RMT. However,
when the networks were split to communities, the ﬂuctuations in the level spacing
became Poissonean, which is another important statistics in RMT. Based on this eﬀect,
Luo et al. proposed that the monitoring of such changes in the spectral properties can
help the identiﬁcations of network modules.

Motivated by these very interesting results, here we study the level spacing
ﬂuctuations in the spectrum of networks in a more general
frame work. Our
investigations of the Erd˝os-R´enyi (E-R) random graph, the Internet, a word association
graph and a protein-protein interaction graph show that similar spectral transitions
occur in these networks as well. However, our results indicate that such transitions in
the spectrum are more likely to be connected to the appearance of a giant component
than to the ideal partitioning of the network, since e.g. in the E-R graph communities are
totally absent. The paper is organised as follows: ﬁrst we summarise the most important
properties of the level spacing distribution in RMT, then describe our results for the
spectral transitions in the E-R graph. Finally, we show that similar spectral transitions
can be induced in real networks as well, simply by destroying the giant component,
without invoking any sophisticated partitioning of the network to communities.

2. The level spacing distribution

The main object of study in RMT is the set of eigenvalues {ei} of the random matrix
representing the system under investigation. In case of networks, this matrix corresponds
to the adjacency matrix, in which the entry Aij = 1 if the nodes i and j are linked,
otherwise Aij = 0. (For simplicity, let us neglect the possible directionality and weight
of the links). One of the most important results of RMT is that complex systems can
be sorted into a few universal classes based on the behaviour of the ﬂuctuations in
the level spacing between these eigenvalues. The level spacing S between two adjacent
eigenvalues is simply Si = ei+1 − ei, however the distribution of this quantity cannot be
universal, as there are systems in which eigenvalues are more dense/sparse on average
compared to others. Therefore, instead the the unfolded level spacings are studied,
which can be deﬁned as

si =

ei+1 − ei
hSii

,

where hSii denotes the local average of the level spacing in the vicinity of ei. The
probability distribution of the unfolded level spacings (which from now on we shall call
simply as the level spacing distribution) can be described with the probability density
s
p(s) and the corresponding cumulative distribution P (s) =
0 p(x)dx. Due to the
R
unfolding (1), the expectation value of the level spacing is one:

hsi =

sp(s)ds = 1.

The level spacing distribution of systems with strongly correlated eigenvalues follows the
statistics of the GOE, deﬁned as an ensemble of random matrices ﬁlled with elements

Another important universality class is formed by the systems with no correlation

p0(s) = exp(−s),

P0(s) = 1 − exp(−s).

In chaotic systems with weak disorder, intermediate statistics were observed as well,
described by the Brody-distribution [36, 37, 38, 39, 40]:
pB(s) = Cαsα−1 exp (−Csα) ,
PB(s) = 1 − exp (−Csα) .

(5a)

(5b)

where C is a normalising constant ensuring the fulﬁl of Eq.(2), and the parameter α
determines how far the distribution falls from the two limiting cases. (At α = 1 we
recover the Poisson-distribution, whereas α = 2 corresponds to the statistics of the
GOE). In the next section we shall analyse the level spacing distribution of the E-R
graph.

3. Spectral transition in the E-R graph

The concept of random graphs was introduced by Erd˝os and R´enyi [41] in the 1950s in a
simple model starting with N nodes, and connecting every pair of nodes independently
with the same probability p. Even though real networks diﬀer from this simple model in
many aspects, the E-R uncorrelated random graph remains still of great interest, since
such a graph can serve both as a test bed for checking all sorts of new ideas concerning
complex networks in general, and as a prototype of random graphs to which all other
random graphs can be compared.

Perhaps the most conspicuous early result on the E-R graphs was related to the
percolation transition taking place at p = 1/N. The appearance of a giant component in
a network, which is also referred to as the percolating component, results in a dramatic
change in the overall topological features of the graph and has been in the centre of
interest for other networks as well. The relative size of the largest component compared
to the total number of nodes is determined by the average degree hki = pN, and the
critical point of the transition is at hki = 1.

In our studies concerning the level spacing distribution of the E-R graph, we
observed a similar phenomenon: the shape of p(s) is determined by hki, or in other
words, the p(s) of E-R graphs with the same average degree follow the same curve.
In Fig.1. we demonstrate this eﬀect by plotting the level spacing distribution for E-R
graphs of size N = 5000 (circles), N = 7000 (squares) and N = 10000 (triangles),

Spectral transitions in networks

with average degree hki = 0.5 (white symbols), hki = 1 (gray symbols), and hki = 1.5
(black symbols). (For each parameter setting, the spectrum of several diﬀerent instances
of E-R graphs with the given N and hki was evaluated numerically, and the resulting
level spacing distributions were averaged). Beside the data collapse for the diﬀerent
N parameters, it can be seen that the level spacing distribution undergoes a dramatic
change when hki is varied around hki = 1. The p(s) at hki = 1, the critical point of
the percolation transition (denoted by gray symbols) is exponential, whereas it shows a
somewhat more complex forms for both hki < 1 and for hki > 1.

The distribution given by (6b) is normalised, and fulﬁls (2) as well. The inset in Fig.2.
shows the relation between the ﬁtting parameter α and the average degree, which can
be expressed simply as

α = 2 − hki .

At the critical point of the percolation transition α becomes unity, therefore P (s) given
by (6b) is transformed into P0(s) = − exp(s), corresponding to Poisson statistics in
RMT.

In the hki ≥ 1 regime the graph contains a giant component. Close to the critical
point, there are other smaller components present as well, however for large enough hki
the size of the giant component eventually reaches the system size. The level spacing
distribution in the vicinity of hki = 1 can be ﬁtted with the Brody-distribution, given
by (5a-5b), corresponding to a statistics in between Poisson and GOE. In Fig.3. we
demonstrate this eﬀect by plotting − log[1 − P (s)] as the function of s on a logarithmic
scale. A cumulative level spacing distribution of the form (5b) is thereby transformed
into Csα, appearing as a straight line with slope α. At the critical point of the
percolation transition α = 1, therefore the slope of the corresponding curve (open
circles) is unity. The slope of the curves is increasing with the average degree, and at

Spectral transitions in networks

hki = 2 it is already close to α = 2, corresponding to GOE statistics. In Fig.4. the
ﬁtting parameter α is shown as the function of hki, following a sigmoid curve, reaching
the α = 2 limit closely above hki = 2.

Figure 3. The level spacings of the E-R graph follow the Brody-distribution in the
hki ≥ 1 regime. By plotting − log[1 − P (s)] as the function of s on logarithmic
scale, the PB(s) given by Eq.(5b) appears as a straight line with slope α.
In the
limiting case of hki = 1 (open circles) the level spacing distribution is Poissonean with
− log[1 − P (s)] = s, corresponding to a straight line with unity slope. For hki = 1.2
(squares), hki = 1.4 (triangles up), hki = 1.6 (diamonds), hki = 1.8 (ﬁlled circles)
and hki = 2 (triangles down) we can observe intermediate level spacing distributions
between Poissonean and GOE, shown by straight lines with increasing slopes.

4. Spectral transition in real networks

Similarly to the E-R graph, spectral transitions can occur in real networks as well. In
our studies we examined the behaviour of the level spacing distribution of the Internet,
a word association network, and a protein-protein interaction network. In case of the
Internet each node corresponded to an Autonomous System, and the links between the
Autonomous Systems were obtained from the DIMES project [42]. The word association
network was constructed from the South Florida Free Association norms list [43], in
which a link from one word to another indicates that people in the surveys associated
the end point of the link with its start point. And ﬁnally, the studied protein-protein
network contained the DIP core list of the protein-protein interactions of S. cerevisiae
[44]. These networks are all scale-free, and they consist of 14161, 10617, and 2609 nodes
and 43430, 63788, and 6355 links, respectively.
In each case, the largest connected
component contained more than 90% of the nodes, and the level spacing distribution
followed the GOE statistics.

Figure 4. The ﬁtting parameter α in the hki ≥ 1 regime as the function of hki.
Starting from α = 1 at hki = 1, as the level spacing distribution transforms from
Poissonean to GOE, the parameter α reaches α = 2 following a sigmoid curve.

In order to obtain a percolation transition similar to that of the E-R graph, we
applied the following recursion to all three networks until their giant components were
destroyed:

• calculate the node degrees,

• remove the node with the largest degree.

This algorithm is a variation of the method used to investigate the attack tolerance
of networks, where the nodes are removed in the oder of their original degree [45].
Therefore, on one hand, the node removal process above can be also viewed as the
simulation of the intentional damage of the investigated networks. On the other hand,
the advantage of the present approach compared to the original process in [45] is that
we can generate several diﬀerent conﬁgurations of the dispersed state: whenever the
largest degree is possessed by more than one node, the algorithm arrives to a branch
point with multiple choices for the next node removal.

In Fig.5a we plotted the observed level spacing distributions at three stages in
the node removal procedure, whereas Fig.5b displays the accompanying cumulative
component size distributions P (n), where n denotes the number of nodes in the
components. The circles correspond to the Internet, the squares to the word association
network, and the triangles to the protein-protein interaction network. The white
symbols show the studied distributions in the original cohesive state of the networks:
P (n) is dominated by an outstandingly large cluster, the giant component, and p(s)
follows GOE statistics. By succedingly removing the nodes with the largest degree,
the size of the largest component decreases, and in the vicinity of the critical point

of the percolation transition P (n) is transformed into a power-law, and p(s) becomes
exponential, as shown by the gray symbols. (These points result from averaging over
multiple instances of the critical state, generated by the algorithm detailed above).
By continuing the node deletion process, the networks fall apart into small disjunct
components, P (n) transforms into a truncated distribution, and p(s) becomes peaked
again, starting from p(s) = 0 at s = 0, as shown by the black symbols. (Again, the

Spectral transitions in networks

points show the result of averaging over multiple instances of the dispersed state). Even
though the p(s) curves for the three diﬀerent networks do not coincide with each other
exactly in Fig.5a, it is clear that they all undergo a similar transition to that of the E-R
graph.

5. Conclusions

According to our investigations the percolation transition in networks is accompanied by
a transition in the level spacing distribution as well. When a giant connected component
containing the majority of nodes is present, p(s) follows the GOE statistics, whereas in
the vicinity of the critical point of the percolation transition, p(s) becomes exponential.
Dispersed networks consisting of many small, disjunct clusters have a p(s) starting
from p(s) = 0 at s = 0 with a peak close to s = 0, and for the E-R graph, the
corresponding cumulative level spacing distribution P (s) can be simply given by the
regularised Gamma-function P (α, αs).

We study and compare the self-similar properties of the ﬂuctuations, as extracted through wavelet
coeﬃcients and a recently developed approach, based on discrete wavelets, which relies on the
local trends extracted through the approximation coeﬃcients. The analysis is carried out on a
variety of physical data sets, as well as Gaussian white noise and binomial multi-fractal model time
series.
It is found that wavelets, designed to extract local polynomial trends for application to
non-stationary data sets, can introduce signiﬁcant variations both in small and large ﬂuctuations,
in the domain of high-pass wavelet coeﬃcients. Hence, although the ﬂuctuation functions based on
wavelet coeﬃcients and the other approach ﬁnd the Hurst scaling exponents accurately, they diﬀer
in their estimation of the higher order moments required for ﬁnding the multifractality of the data
sets. The latter approach gives more accurate result.

INTRODUCTION

Fractals are ubiquitous in nature [1]. They manifest
in areas ranging from ﬁnancial markets to natural sci-
ences. Several techniques have been developed to study
the correlations and scaling properties of time series ex-
hibiting self-similar behavior; some of these data sets are
non-stationary in character. Various methods like R/S
analysis [2], structure function method [3], wavelet trans-
form modulus maxima [4], detrended ﬂuctuation analysis
and its variants [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], average
wavelet coeﬃcient method [15] and a recently developed
discrete wavelet based approach by the present authors,
have been employed for the characterization of ﬂuctua-
tions [16, 17].

Wavelets, through their multi-resolution and localiza-
tion abilities, are well suited for extracting ﬂuctuations at
various scales from local trends over appropriate window
sizes [18, 19]. The nature of the ﬂuctuations extracted
partly depend on the choice of the wavelets, which are
designed to have properties useful for a desired analysis.
For example, the Daubechies family of wavelets satisfy
vanishing moment conditions, which make them ideal to
separate polynomial trends in a data set. However, the
process of extracting the trend through ﬁnite number of
non-symmetric ﬁlter coeﬃcients in the above wavelet ba-
sis sets can aﬀect the extraction of both small and large
ﬂuctuations. As is intuitively clear, the small ﬂuctua-
tions are aﬀected by the number of ﬁlter coeﬃcients,
used for taking the weighted diﬀerences in the wavelet
decomposition. The length of the ﬁlters increase progres-
sively in Daubechies basis to extract higher order poly-
In case of the larger ﬂuctuations, both

location and magnitude are aﬀected because of the non-
symmetric nature of the ﬁlter coeﬃcients. In a number
of wavelet based approach for characterizing self-similar

data, wavelet high-pass coeﬃcients are used in ﬁnding the
ﬂuctuation function or other related quantities. Hence,
it is natural to enquire about the degree to which the
estimation of the fractal nature of the time series are af-
fected by the aforementioned variations in the wavelet
coeﬃcients.

The goal of the present article is to analyze and com-
pare the self-similar properties of the ﬂuctuations, as ex-
tracted through wavelet coeﬃcients and a recently devel-
oped approach, due to the present authors. The study is
carried out on Gaussian white noise and binomial multi-
fractal model time series, as well as a number of physical
data sets. It is found that wavelets introduce signiﬁcant
variations both in small and large ﬂuctuations, in the
domain of high-pass wavelet coeﬃcients. Although the
ﬂuctuation function based on wavelet coeﬃcients and the
other approach do not diﬀer in estimating Hurst scaling
exponent, their estimation of the multifractal nature of
the data sets diﬀer signiﬁcantly, the latter approach gives
reliable result.

The paper is organized as follows. In the following sec-
tion, we study the nature of the ﬂuctuations extracted
through the wavelet coeﬃcients. In Sec.III, we then pro-
ceed to the detailed analysis of ﬂuctuations of Gaussian
white noise and binomial multi-fractal model. A compar-
ison of the results through the two diﬀerent approaches
are then shown. Subsequently, we carry out analysis of
the ﬂuctuations in the data of observed ionization cur-
rent and potentials in tokamak plasma, time series con-
structed from random matrix ensembles and the ﬁnancial
data sets belonging to NASDAQ and Bombay stock ex-
change (BSE) composite indices. Finally, we conclude
after summarizing our ﬁndings and giving future direc-
tions of work.

FLUCTUATIONS IN THE WAVELET DOMAIN

In discrete wavelet transform it is well-known that, a
given signal belonging to L2 space can be represented
in a nested vector space spanned by the scaling functions
alone. This basic requirement of multi-resolution analysis
(MRA) can be formally written as [20],

... ⊂ ν−2 ⊂ ν−1 ⊂ ν−0 ⊂ ν1 ⊂ ν2... ⊂ L2,

(1)

with ν−∞ = 0 and ν∞ = L2. This provides a successive
approximation of a given signal in terms of low-pass or
approximation coeﬃcients. It is clear that, the space that
contains high resolution signals will also contain signals
of lower resolution. The signal or time series can be ap-
proximated at a level of ones choice, for use in ﬁnding the
local trend over a desired window. The ﬂuctuations can
then be obtained by subtracting the above trend from
the signal. We have followed this approach for extract-
ing the ﬂuctuations, by elimination of local polynomial
trends through the Daubechies wavelets [16, 17].

Wavelets also provide a decomposition of a signal in
terms of wavelet coeﬃcients and one low-pass coeﬃcient:

L2 = ... ⊕ W−2 ⊕ W−1 ⊕ W0 ⊕ W1 ⊕ W2 ...

(2)

and

W−∞ ⊕ ... ⊕ W−1 = ν0.

(3)

Wavelet coeﬃcients represent variations of the signal
at diﬀerent scales. For example, level one coeﬃcients cap-
ture the highest frequency components, corresponding to
variations at highest resolution and other wavelet coeﬃ-
cients represent variations at progressively higher scales
or lower resolutions. As mentioned earlier, these coeﬃ-
cients can diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the true ﬂuctuations
in the data sets. Below, we explore this aspect through
the estimation of Hurst exponents and other higher order
moments required for ﬁnding the multifractal nature of
data sets.

Let xt (t = 1, 2, 3, ..., N ) be the time series of length
N . First one determines the ”proﬁle” (say Y (i)), which
is cumulative sum of series after subtracting the mean.

Y (i) =

[xt − hxi],

i = 1, ...., N.

(4)

t=1

Next, we obtain the statistics of scale dependence by
transforming the proﬁle of the time series into wavelet
space, the coeﬃcients of wavelets at various scales s are
used to determine the ﬂuctuation function. The high fre-
quency details are captured by the lower scale wavelet co-
eﬃcients and the higher scales capture the low frequency
details. By convolving the discrete wavelet transform
over the given time series, the wavelet coeﬃcients are
obtained for various scales:

Wj,k = 2j/2

Yi ψ(2jt − k).

(5)

N −1

X
i=0

Here ’j’ is the scaling index and k represents the trans-
lation variable. Since discrete wavelet transform satisﬁes
orthogonality condition, it can provide the information of
time series at various scales unambiguously. Performing
wavelet transform using Daubechies basis, the polyno-
mial trends in the time series are eliminated. In the anal-
ysis carried out below we make use of the Daubechies-4
wavelets. As has been observed earlier, small ﬂuctuations
are least aﬀected by this basis and straight line trends
(akin to a linear ﬁt) are removed through the use of this
wavelet [16].

The wavelet power is calculated by summing the

squares of the coeﬃcient values for each level:

A(j) =

W 2

j,k.

(6)

To characterize the time series, the ﬂuctuation function
F (s) at a level s is obtained from the cumulative power
spectrum:

F (s) =

A(j)

.

The scaling behavior is then obtained through,

F (s) ∼ sH .

(8)

Here H is the Hurst scaling exponent, which can be
obtained from the slope of the log-log plot of F (s) vs
scales s. It is well known that Hurst exponent is one of
the fractal measures, which varies form 0 < H < 1. For
persistent time series H > 0.5 and H = 0.5 uncorrelated
series. H < 0.5 for anti-persistent time series.

COMPARISON OF WAVELET COEFFICIENT
AND TREND BASED FLUCTUATION ANALYSIS

We brieﬂy outline below, the procedure of a recently
developed discrete wavelet trend based approach for es-
timating the multi-fractal behavior of a non-stationary
time series [17].
It involves the use of wavelet trans-
form on the proﬁle Y (i) to separate the ﬂuctuations from
the trend over a window size corresponding to the dif-
ferent levels of wavelet decomposition. We obtain the
trend of the time series by discarding the high-pass co-
eﬃcients and reconstructing the time series from the ap-
proximation coeﬃcients using inverse wavelet transform.

(b) BSE sensex.

The ﬂuctuations are then extracted at each level by sub-
tracting the obtained time series from the original data.
Though the Daubechies wavelets extract the ﬂuctuations
nicely, its asymmetric nature and wrap around problem
aﬀects the precision of the values. This is corrected by ap-
plying wavelet transform to the reverse proﬁle, to extract
a new set of ﬂuctuations. These ﬂuctuations are then
reversed and averaged over the earlier obtained ﬂuctua-
tions. These are the ﬂuctuations (at a particular level),
which we consider for analysis.

The extracted ﬂuctuations are subdivided into non-
overlapping segments Ms = int(N/s), where s =
2(L−1)W is the wavelet window size at a particular level
(L) for the chosen wavelet. Here W is the number of
ﬁlter coeﬃcients of the discrete wavelet transform basis
under consideration. For example, with Db-4 wavelets,
s = 4 at level 1 and s = 8 at level 2 and so on. It is obvi-
ous that some data points would have to be discarded, in
case N/s is not an integer. This causes statistical errors
in calculating the local variance. In such cases, we have
to repeat the above procedure starting from the end and
going to the beginning to calculate the local variance.

FIG. 3: Wavelet coeﬃcients at various levels for NASDAQ
composite data.

The qth order ﬂuctuation function, Fq(s) is obtained
by squaring and averaging ﬂuctuations over all segments:

Fq(s) ≡ {

[F 2(b, s)]q/2}1/q.

b=1

Here ’q’ is the order of moments that takes real val-
ues. The above procedure is repeated for variable window
sizes for diﬀerent value of q (except q=0). The scaling
behavior is obtained by analyzing the ﬂuctuation func-
tion,

Fq(s) ∼ sh(q),

(10)

in a logarithmic scale for each value of q. A logarithmic
averaging procedure is employed for calculating Fq=0,
which avoids the divergence problem of the above for-
mula for q = 0. It should be noted that h(q = 2) = H, is
the Hurst exponent [14].

For testing purpose we analyze the time series of Gaus-
in which case the Hurst measure is
sian white noise,
known, (H = 0.5) and the time series generated through
the binomial multifractal model, for which the Hurst
scaling exponent can be calculated through analytical
procedure. These would be compared with numerical
results obtained through wavelet analysis, for illustrat-
ing the eﬃcacy of our procedure. In this wavelet based
analysis, proﬁle of the time series has been subjected to
a multi-level wavelet decomposition. The length of the
data should be 2N , otherwise constant padding is added
at the ends.

We have analyzed three sets of experimentally ob-
served time series of variables in ohmically heated edge
plasma in Aditya tokamak [21]. The time series are i) ion
saturation current, ii) ion saturation current when the
probe is in the limiter shadow, and iii) ﬂoating poten-
tial, 6mm inside the main plasma. Each time series has
about 24,000 data points sampled at 1MHZ [22]. These
are shown in Fig. 1. The study of ﬂuctuations play an
important role in our understanding of turbulent trans-

we show ﬁnancial time series of NASDAQ composite in-
dex and BSE sensex index values. Wavelet coeﬃcients
at various scales have been displayed in Fig. 3 and Fig.

the time series of three experimental data sets and ﬁ-
nancial stock market data, respectively. The scaling ex-
ponent H, for all the three experimental time series as
well as ﬁnancial data sets shows long range correlations
(H > 0.5). We have also analyzed the discrete time series
obtained from random matrix ensembles corresponding
to Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE), Gaussian sym-
plectic ensemble (GSE) and Gaussian unitary ensemble
(GUE). These show long range anti-correlation behav-
iors H < 0.5. Gaussian diagonal ensemble (GDE) shows

ing that, we have followed the recent approach of Relano
et.al., for converting the random matrix ensemble data
to discrete time series [23]. In Table-I, Hurst exponents
of various data sets are given. These results agree with
our previous discrete wavelet based approach.

We now study the higher order moments in the wavelet
coeﬃcient method. In table-II, the h(q) values of various

moments for the binomial multifractal time series, for the
analytically calculable result, discrete wavelet coeﬃcient
method and our earlier approach respectively. This time
series has been chosen since for this, the scaling behavior
is analytically calculable. One observes signiﬁcant de-
viations, for both higher and lower values of q (except
for q=2), in the wavelet coeﬃcient based approach and
the earlier method. We have observed similar deviations
in other data sets. It is worth noting that, the ﬂuctua-
tion function gets signiﬁcant contribution from the small
ﬂuctuations for negative values of q; the larger ﬂuctua-
tions dominate when q is large and positive. This clearly
indicates that, wavelet coeﬃcients diﬀer from the true
physical ﬂuctuations for both large and small values.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have contrasted the properties of
the ﬂuctuation function, obtained through wavelet co-
eﬃcients and an earlier trend based approach. Both

the approaches yield correct values for the Hurst expo-
nent. However, in estimating multifractal behavior the
latter performs much better. This happens because the
wavelet coeﬃcients do not capture faithfully, the small
and large ﬂuctuations in data sets. We have used deci-
mated wavelet coeﬃcients; the statistics may be further
improved through undecimated coeﬃcients. We have
checked that, use of higher order wavelets further detori-
ated the results.

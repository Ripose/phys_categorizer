Abstract. Higher-rank Minkowski valuations are eﬃcient means for describing the
geometry and connectivity of spatial patterns. We show how to extend the framework of
the scalar Minkowski valuations to vector- and tensor-valued measures. The versatility
of these measures is demonstrated by using simple toy models as well as real data.

1.1 Introduction

The spatial patterns originating from the polymorphic aggregation of matter in
Nature occur on vastly diﬀerent length scales and with unlimited variety. For
instance, the pattern shown in Figure 1.1 could represent a biological structure
obtained with X-ray tomography, or a colloidal cluster in a milky emulsion. In
fact, Figure 1.1 displays an isodensity contour of cosmic matter as traced by the
galaxies surrounding the Milky way, which lies in the center of the plot.
The visual impression from such pictures may already convey valuable insight
into the dynamic evolution or – in the context of biology – into the functionality
of such structures. However, for unbiased inferences as well as for the compar-
ison with model simulations, one needs objective and quantitative measures to
characterize the geometry and topology of typical structural motifs.
In this article we deal with a family of functions which provide a unique descrip-
tion of the morphology displayed by spatial patterns. We call these functions the
Minkowski valuations; they are extensions of the well-known Minkowski func-
tionals often mentioned within this volume (see the contributions by C. Arns et
al. and M. L¨osche and P. Kr¨uger in this volume as well as [25] in the previous
volume LNP 554). Therefore they share some of the simplicity and beauty which
the Minkowski functionals own. In particular, they are characterized by simple

axioms which set intuitively reasonable standards for a morphological descrip-
tion. In the same way as the Minkowski functionals generalize the notion of the
volume, the Minkowski valuations extend the notion of the mass vector (or cen-
ter of mass) and of the inertia tensor. Like their scalar relatives the majority of
the Minkowski valuations are curvature measures integrated over the surface of
a pattern.
We start with a short motivation in Section 1.2 by showing that there are good
reasons to go beyond the scalar Minkowski functionals. After having outlined
ways to generalize the Minkowski functionals (Section 1.3), we review some of
the extensions’ mathematical properties in Section 1.4. To illustrate how useful
the Minkowski valuations are, we discuss concrete applications covering sub-
molecular up to cosmological scales (Sections 1.5 and 1.6).
Before, two cautionary remarks are appropriate: ﬁrst, in order to distinguish
conceptually between the scalar Minkowski functionals and their higher-rank ex-
tensions, we shall address the whole entirety of Minkowski functionals and their
extensions via the term “Minkowski valuations” (MVs), whereas “Minkowski
functionals” (MFs) is reserved to the scalar Minkowski functionals as before.
Secondly, there is a vivid theoretical development of higher-rank Minkowski val-
uations these days [43,44,9]. Therefore, this overview can not provide a complete

1 Vector- and tensor-valued descriptors for spatial patterns

survey on Minkowski valuations; on the contrary, substantial progress is to be
expected both from the mathematical side as well as from applications. For
instance, morphological analysis based on Minkowski valuations may be use-
ful to quantify molecular orientations (see the contributions by F. Schmid and
N. H. Phuong, U. S. Schwarz and G. Gompper, D. Jeulin, C. Arns et al., and
H.-J. Vogel in this volume). Our vector-valued descriptors may also be used to
reﬁne the morphological analysis of Langmuir monolayer phases (presented by
M. L¨osche and P. Kr¨uger in this volume) which has so far been based merely
on scalar MFs. Another application may cover the geometric characterization of
liquid foams described by F. Graner in this volume, where stress tensors need
to be related to a complex spatial structure.

1.2 Going beyond scalar Minkowski functionals – a

physical motivation

K

The following problem is typical for challenges occurring in physics: the forma-
tion of galaxy clusters depends in a complicated way on the background cosmol-
ogy usually described in terms of a cosmological model. Such a model is deﬁned
through the values of the cosmological parameters and the power spectrum of
the initial density perturbations [30,6]. In order to investigate the impact of the
background cosmology on galaxy clusters one carries out gravitational N -body
simulations; typical results comprise cluster images such as those shown in Fig-
ure 1.2. To compare the models and to check which model ﬁts best present-day
cluster observations, one has to use quantitative and discriminative morpholog-
ical measures.
The Minkowski functionals certainly place practical tools at the physicist’s dis-
posal. Deﬁned on the convex ring
d, i.e. for ﬁnite unions of compact, convex sets
in d-dimensional Euclidean space, they are the only motion-invariant, convex-
continuous, and additive descriptors. Despite this very general characterization
there are only a ﬁnite number of Minkowski functionals, namely (d + 1) in d
dimensions (characterization theorem, [16,21]). They have simple geometrical
meanings derived from their representation as integrals. These integrals either
extend over the pattern itself to yield the volume, or cover its surface which
is weighted with combinations of the local curvatures in order to give – in two
dimensions, e.g. – the perimeter and the integrated curvature (which equals the
Euler characteristic). The Minkowski functionals also arise quite naturally as
expansion coeﬃcients in the Steiner formula [42] specifying the volume of the
parallel body of a convex body. Indeed, the Minkowski functionals have been
extensively applied to physical structures at vastly diﬀerent length scales, see
[25] for an overview and [20] for astrophysical applications. On the mathemati-
cal side, numerous useful results such as the principal kinematic formulae or the
Crofton formulae (see [16]) have been proven with integral geometric methods.
However, the morphometry with Minkowski functionals is by no means compre-
hensive. Combining two of their deﬁning principles, additivity and homogeneity,

GIF-project). Their diﬀerent morphologies are due to diﬀerent values of the cosmolog-
ical parameters and to diﬀerent initial power spectra imposed (left panel: τ Cold Dark
Matter model; right panel open Cold Dark Matter model, see [6] for more details).
Apart from that, however, the clusters stem from comparable initial conditions. In or-
der to distinguish between both models we need a thorough morphological description.

one can easily see, that, e.g., moving a connected part of a pattern results in sig-
niﬁcant visible changes which can not be detected by the Minkowski functionals
at all. This is illustrated in the ﬁrst panel of Figure 1.3 representing schematic
clusters. It is surely of interest, however, in which way the subclumps of a system
are arranged, and how they are aligned with respect to each other (see the second
panel of Figure 1.3). Therefore, we have to move beyond the scalar Minkowski
functionals. It turns out that one can generalize the Minkowski functionals with-
out leaving the mathematical framework of integral geometry.

1.3 The hierarchy of Minkowski valuations – extending

the framework

There are several ways to extend the framework of the Minkowski functionals.
For instance, one may start with Steiner’s formula.

The Steiner formula. It is a natural choice to employ the volume V (K) =
K dV
of a body K for its very coarse description. If the parallel body Kǫ is considered,
R
which contains all points closer to K than ǫ > 0, and if K is convex, then one
ﬁnds from Steiner’s formula an expansion for V (Kǫ) in powers of ǫ,

Fig. 1.3. Neither the schematic clusters displayed in panel 1.a. and 1.b. nor both
patterns in panel 2.a. and 2.b. can be distinguished from each other using only the
scalar Minkowski functionals. Additivity and motion-invariance prevent the MFs from
discriminating between the diﬀerent positions (upper panels) or diﬀerent orientations
(lower panels) of the subcomponents, respectively.

where the Minkowski functionals Wν arise as expansion coeﬃcients. The latter
functionals are useful morphometric concepts and can be extended to non-convex
patterns. In this sense, the volume quite generally leads to a family of related
measures.
Since we saw that in some applications (recall the upper panels of Figure 1.3)
the position of a body may be worth considering, we specify the location of K
with its mass vector

Alternatively, we could introduce its center of mass p0 ≡
Moreover, as the lower panels of Figure 1.3 indicate, the body’s orientation may
be relevant. In this case we have to move on to even higher moments; for instance,

functions with rank r ≥ 1, see below Section 1.3 for the explanation of these concepts.

Ed, where
Ed is the d-dimensional second-rank unit tensor) are of major interest for the
physicist: the mass center of a rigid body moves in space as if the whole force
acting on the body was concentrated onto a point particle at its center of mass.
The inertia tensor determines how a body is rotating, given a ﬁxed angular
momentum. – Higher-rank moments such as symmetric r-rank tensors of the
form V r (K)
dV xr with r > 2, may be considered, too.
Now it is again possible to write down a Steiner-type formula for the transition
to the parallel body of a convex set K [40,43]: the scalar expansion coeﬃcients
have to be replaced by vector- or tensor-valued coeﬃcients. The following simple
argument shows that not only the character, but also the number of coeﬃcients
has to change: for a unit ball centered at the origin, BR(0)

construction of the parallel body results in B(ǫ+R)(0). On the other hand, as

shown that in general the expansion coeﬃcients Mr,ν can be written as linear

look more basic than the coeﬃcients

arising in the Steiner formula for the volume tensor. It seems therefore, as if,
in contrast to the case of the scalars, the Steiner coeﬃcients are no longer the
basic quantities. In order to generalize the Minkowski functionals we therefore
have to move to an alternative route.

order to arrive at a coherent notation, we set W r,0
V r and W r,j
0 = 0 for j > 0.
Higher-rank Minkowski functionals therefore are higher moments of the scalar
Minkowski functionals where the local surface is weighted with both position
and surface normal. If the body K is shifted with a translation vector t, then

where we use the fact that the d-dimensional orthogonal group O(d) has a natural

Recalling that the Minkowski functionals can be described axiomatically, one
would be inclined at this point to look for a characterization theorem for vectors
and tensors. It turns out that one has to include even more valuations in order
to achieve that purpose.

Axiomatic characterization. A rigorous way to extend the Minkowski functionals
is therefore to relax one of their deﬁning axioms. We keep the additivity

we replace the motion invariance by motion covariance deﬁned as follows: for

Equation (1.12) gives all of the Minkowski valuations and ﬁnally answers the
question how to generalize the MFs in a suitable manner. It contains more
valuations than those given in Equation (1.6). However, some caution has to
be exercised: Alesker’s theorem [4] only bounds the dimension of the tensor
functional spaces from above. It is not obvious that all of the above functionals
are linear independent. Indeed, [24] proved some linear relationships holding
among the tensors. In order to give one example, Gauß’ theorem yields

Minkowski vectors. Minkowski vectors, i.e. Minkowski valuations of rank one,
have been known for some years [18,40,41,17]. There is a strict one-to-one cor-
respondence between the vectors and the scalars: for each Minkowski functional

vectors was extensively scrutinized, see, e.g., [18]. For physical applications of

are a useful concept. Their meaning is straight forward: they locate morpho-
logical information. We shall see below that, if the curvature centroids do not
coincide within one point, strong evidence for asymmetry is given.

Second-rank tensors. The situation becomes more complicated for higher-rank
tensors. It can be shown, that at the second rank, the following (3d + 1) tensors
provide a base [9]:

for ν = 0, .., (d
1). Not all of them are interesting from a physical point of view,
since some of them are related to Minkowski functionals times the unit tensor
and thus do not contain any new information. Principal kinematic formulae and
Crofton formulae are known for second-rank tensors [43,9,44].
For a geometrical interpretation, we have to bear in mind, that the values of the
tensors depend on the origin adopted. For W 2,0
(ν = 0, .., d), however, the cor-
responding curvature centroid pν is a natural reference point; the other tensors
listed in Equation (1.15) are translation-invariant. Obviously, with such a choice
the tensors are sensitive to morphological anisotropies, in the case of symmetry
they align along the symmetry axes, otherwise they distinguish morphologically
interesting directions. It is therefore useful to consider their eigenvalues and
eigendirections.

Beyond second rank. Although higher-rank tensors may be interesting as well,
we shall not consider them further at this point.

1.4.2 Examples

In order to give a ﬁrst example of how the Minkowski valuations discriminate
spatial structures, we consider a few simple patterns as shown in Figure 1.5. In
the case of a circle (panel 1) the curvature centroids coincide within the circle’s
center; the tensors – here represented as an ellipse featuring their eigenvalues
and the corresponding directions – are isotropic. It is useful to divide the ten-
sors W r,s
. The trace of the
normalized tensor (i.e. the sum of the eigenvalues) quantiﬁes to which extent

by the corresponding Minkowski functionals W 0,0

and the eigendirections as well.

the morphological information is concentrated around the center, how large the
morphological ﬂuctuations around the center are.
The transition to an ellipse of the same volume as the circle (panel 2) can be
traced either with the tensors becoming anisotropic or with the ratio of the
squared surface to the volume (isoperimetric ratio, see [38]). Furthermore, as
the morphological concentration is decreasing, the traces of most of the normal-
ized tensors increase, especially of W 2,0
: the more elongated the ellipse becomes,
the higher is its curvature at its very fringes along the horizontal direction. The
normalized trace of W 1,1
, on the contrary, becomes smaller, since the normal
and the local position vector cease to be parallel to each other. The curvature
centroids still coincide with each other because of the point symmetry. – If we
reduce the symmetry further to a merely axially symmetric conﬁguration (panel
3), the curvature centroids fan out along the symmetry axis. In the case of no
symmetry at all (panel 4) they may constitute a triangle.
Finally, suppose one is given three convex bodies (or d + 1 ones in d dimensions)
with known Minkowski functionals in order to combine them into a pattern
such as indicated in panels 5 and 6. Given the scalar measures of the whole
pattern, especially its Euler characteristic, one can constrain the number of in-
tersections or subclumps in a pattern, which does not make any diﬀerence in
our examples. For disentangling the positions of the grains, however, one has to
know the curvature centroids. The centroids weight the subclusters according

1 Vector- and tensor-valued descriptors for spatial patterns

11

to their Minkowski functionals. Therefore, whereas from the volume’s point of
view, only the larger components contribute signiﬁcantly, all subclumps have
the same weight (Euler characteristic = 1) for the curvature centroid p2. If the
subclumps do not overlap, one can indeed completely recover their positions.
In Figure 1.6, we show all tensors for the last example in more detail. Obviously,
there are not only anisotropies; rather diﬀerent morphological directions are rele-
vant. The volume concentration around the center of mass is relatively high, since
the volume is dominated by the two largest subclusters, being close to each other.
It is quite the opposite with W 2,0
: p2 is relatively far away from all the clumps,
the curvature around p2 is dispersed leading to a high value of tensor’s trace.
The main relevant direction connects the pair of large clumps with the third
subcluster. The tensor W 1,1
is always isotropic, as shown in Equation (1.13), its
1
trace is connected to the volume. Obviously, W 1,1
complement each
other; indeed they add up to a diagonal tensor (recall the linear relationships
described in [43]). Their eigenvectors’ alignment with the coordinate axes is due
to the fact that all the subclumps are aligned parallel to the axes as well. Oth-
and W 0,2
erwise, W 1,1
1 would average over the orientations of the subclumps.
Finally, W 0,2
is isotropic, its trace equals the Euler characteristic.
The detailed description of patterns given by the Minkowski valuations can be
used in practical applications, as we shall see in the next section.

1.5 Physical applications of higher-rank Minkowski

1.5.1 The inner structure of spiral galaxies

The classiﬁcation of spiral or disc galaxies into speciﬁc types (the Hubble types,
e.g., [19]) is an important step towards their physical understanding; there are
competing theoretical pictures trying to explain the formation of spiral arms
[23,15]. In Figure 1.7 we display a real galaxy observed face-on together with a
simulation according to a percolation model [15]. So far one has mainly relied
on an assignment by eye in order to classify observed disc galaxies and to com-
pare observational data with theoretical models [28]. One of the reasons for this
is that spiral arms are easily detected by the human eye, but are rather hard
to quantify. Here we use Minkowski valuations to reveal aspects of the inner
structure of spiral galaxies (see [36,11,22] for some discussion of how to quantify
morphometric features of spiral galaxies, and especially [1,2]).
In order to render an optical galaxy image accessible to a Minkowski analy-
sis, it is helpful to understand it as a two-dimensional surface brightness ﬁeld
u(x). We may then estimate the Minkowski valuations of the excursion sets
Mv =
. Contrary to large scale cosmological data (e.g. the distri-
bution of galaxies or clusters of galaxies), such a density ﬁeld is neither homo-
geneous nor isotropic; rather it reveals a point of considerable symmetry: the
center of mass. We expect the curvature centroids to coincide within this point
and therefore concentrate on second-rank Minkowski tensors.
In order to detect a possible overall anisotropy, we divide the smaller eigenvalue

X can serve as a measure of the anisotropy. Such an anisotropy
may reﬂect a physical anisotropy, induced, for instance, by the presence of two

other characteristic feature of disc galaxies, namely the way in which the radial
surface brightness distribution declines (with increasing radius), can be analyzed
by scanning through various threshold values v. We applied (suitably normal-
ized) concentration parameters Pν (built from Tr(W 2,0
)) to the images of both
real galaxies (C. Moellenhoﬀ, private communication) as well as to galaxies pro-
duced by a percolation model ([45]; see [13] for details). These morphological
descriptors reveal strong luminosity concentration for real galaxies, which could
not be reproduced by any of the model galaxies (see Fig.1.9) with reasonable
choices for the model parameters. Using the morphology of observed disc galax-
ies, one can therefore rule out the percolation model (at least in its simple form)
as a viable attempt to explain the formation of spiral arms.

1.5.2 The morphology of galaxy clusters

As mentioned in Section 1.2, the morphology of clusters may constrain the values
of the cosmological parameters. Intuitively, one may expect clusters in cosmologi-
cal low-density models to have less substructure than in high-density models [32].
Using Minkowski valuations, we check whether this eﬀect can be observed for
the cosmological GIF simulations [6]. We analyze the clusters’ projected mass
distributions such as shown in Figure 1.2. Observations from the gravitational

tensors. We consider the galaxy NGC 1232 (shown in the left panel of Figure 1.7)
and a sample of model galaxies following a percolation model (an example of a model
prediction is displayed in the right panel of Figure 1.7). We plot two concentration
parameters (as described in the main text) versus decreasing surface brightness thresh-
old values, i.e. increasing surface area. The error bars indicate 1σ ﬂuctuations around
the expectation value of the model, whereas the single line refers to NGC 1232. The

thus is incompatible with real data.

In order to make the simulation data, which consist of “particles tracing mat-
ter”, accessible to the Minkowski valuations, we construct a pixelized density
ﬁeld u(x) and smooth it with a Gaussian kernel of width4 λ = 0.3h−1Mpc. The
resulting ﬁeld uλ(x) contains the overall shape of the cluster. Again we estimate
the Minkowski valuations of the excursion sets, which contain all pixels above
a given density threshold v. Our method to estimate the Minkowski functionals
from the grid is based upon Crofton’s formulae [46,37,7]. For each cluster we av-
erage a function of the Minkowski valuations f over diﬀerent density thresholds:

For more technical details, see [7]. For each time period (or cosmological red-
shift) we estimate the order parameters for three projections per cluster and
average over all clusters in one cosmological model in order to extract a typical
morphology. In Figure 1.10, we display the evolution of the averaged morpho-
logical parameters vs. redshift. One recognizes immediately a relaxation process,
leading to less substructure (and lower values of the morphological order param-
eters) as time goes by (from right to left). Furthermore, clear diﬀerences between
the cosmological background models arise. Indeed the theoretical predictions ac-
cording to which the low-density clusters (OCDM) exhibit less substructure, are
conﬁrmed for the past; for redshift z = 0, the diﬀerences disappear.
All of our order parameters show a similar behavior. The reason probably is that
we average over diﬀerent types of relaxation processes. An investigation of single
clusters should reveal diﬀerences between, e.g., a bimodal merger dominated by
two colliding subclumps and a more isotropic mass infall.

1.5.3 The geometry of the electric charge distribution in molecules

An important implication of the atom hypothesis is that the structures of mole-
cules are to be explained in terms of their constituent parts, the atoms. Heuristic
principles based upon this assumption work quite well in chemistry. However,
if one tries to justify this hypothesis in the framework of quantum mechanics,
the notion of an individual atom seems to disappear, since the negative charge
distributions of the atoms merge, blurring the electron clouds which deﬁne the
single atoms.
Bader [5] proposed an elegant method to recover the notion of atoms in molecules.
Since, from the quantum mechanical point of view, the charge density proﬁle ̺(r)
is the only relevant quantity, its geometry and topology must contain the notion

X, shift of morphology S and twist of morphology T are shown versus time. The time is
given in terms of the observable cosmological redshift. Redshift z = 0 means the present
day, higher redshifts lead back into past. In order to get typical results for two cos-
mological models (low-density model with an open geometry, called open Cold Dark
Matter, OCDM: dashed line; high-density model with a massive τ neutrino, named
τ CDM: solid line) we average over about 15 clusters and 3 orthogonal projections per
cluster within each model. As the results show, our morphological order parameters
quantitatively feature the diﬀerences between the models which are in accordance with
the theoretical predictions. For details on the cosmological Cold Dark Matter models

of atoms. Using the critical points of the density distribution ̺, where
̺ = 0,
one can deﬁne atoms as local density maxima together with a surrounding do-
main enclosed by zero-ﬂux surfaces. This geometrical approach can be extended
to chemical bonds and has been justiﬁed on physical grounds. Moreover, it pro-
vides us with means to visualize molecules in a proper way using the charge
density proﬁle, see Figure 1.11 for an illustration. A distinguished role is played
2̺ = 0 which separates the zone where chemical reactions are
by the surface
likely to happen from the rest of space.
Obviously, this is an area of research where physics and geometry strongly inter-
act, and the applications of higher-rank Minkowski valuations may yield useful
information on the structure of the chemical bonding. First, the morphology of
the whole molecules can be simply described in terms of the Minkowski val-
uations of the density ﬁeld. The atoms, which Bader deﬁnes [5], may not be

compact in every case, so the single atoms can not be understood in terms of
the Minkowski valuations. However, the fact that the atoms’ positions are spec-
iﬁed in Bader’s theory gives us the chance of probing the molecular structure
with the Boolean grain method where the atoms’ positions are decorated using
spheres (either monodisperse or with radii mirroring physical quantities). Note,
that at this point one really needs tensors, since in this case the locations and
the orientations of subsystems are of crucial importance; and this local informa-
tion lies beyond the scope of the scalar measures. Bader’s theory constructs also
a graph of bonds, that may be analyzed with Minkowski valuations straight-
fowardly.
But given the fact that both the molecules and the constituting atoms are de-
ﬁned in terms of geometry, one may go one step further and try to discover
phenomenological principles allowing one to predict the shape of molecules given
their constituents.
These endeavors clearly are beyond the scope of this article. However, in order
to illustrate to some extent how useful the Minkowski valuations may prove in
this area, we consider brieﬂy some of the Minkowski tensors for the H+
In order to treat the H+
2 ion consisting of two protons and an electron in the
framework of quantum mechanics, one often considers the protons as ﬁxed in
space (Born-Oppenheimer approximation) thereby reducing the problem to an
eﬀective one-particle problem of an electron moving in the potential of two pos-
itively charged nuclei. A reasonable ansatz for the quantal wave function of the
electron – at least suitable to illustrate what is basically happening – is a super-
position of quantum states where the electron is bound to either of the protons.
To be more precise, let us consider the protons as being separated by their

2 ion.

that the iso-surfaces of the bonding state are slightly more extended than those

of the anti-bonding state. But on the whole, the diﬀerences are small: the con-
centration of the charge distribution is basically determined by the distance of
the protons. If we ask for morphologically relevant directions, the diﬀerences be-
tween both states are much more perspicuous. The anisotropy of the azimuthal
symmetric quantum states can be quantiﬁed via

the protons lying at (x, y, z) = (
1, 0, 0) and (1, 0, 0), respectively. For small
−
charge fractions, the tensor W 2,0
is dominated by the peaks around the pos-
itively charged protons yielding a maximum anisotropy, but no essential dif-
ference between both states. However, as we move to lower density thresholds
and higher charge fractions, the bonding state isotropises much more quickly
than the anti-bonding one. In the bonding state, therefore, the electron forms
a cloud spreading out over both atoms in a quite isotropic way, whereas in the
anti-bonding state, the signature of the two distinct protons remains still visible.
The chemical bond therefore is mirrored by the geometry of the electron density
distribution, as quantiﬁed via Minkowski tensors.
This example is but an elementary ﬁrst illustration of the nature of the chemical
bond. In the spirit of Bader’s theory, one can possibly go much further in order
to consider single atoms in molecules. Additivity can serve as a guiding princi-
ple, since Bader found that there are stable atom conﬁgurations which persist
through diﬀerent types of molecules, presenting a sort of rigid module movable
as a whole; this fact is well-known from chemistry, of course.

1.6 Density functional theory based on Minkowski

valuations

Having shown the morphometric versatility of MVs, we conclude our discussion
of applications by considering systems where integral geometric quantities en-
ter a physical approximation. The quantities that come into play at this point
generalize the Minkowski valuations further and may indicate a new direction of
interest.
Density functional theory became the standard method to study inhomogeneous
classical ﬂuids in the last 20 years. The main feature of such physical systems is
the spatial variation of the equilibrium density ρeq(x) which minimizes the free
energy Ω. Density functional theory is based on the exact result that the free
energy of the inhomogeneous ﬂuid can be expressed as a functional Ω[ρ(x)] of
the density ρ(x). Thus, all relevant thermodynamic properties such as surface
tensions or phase transitions of conﬁned ﬂuids can be calculated from Ω[ρeq(x)];
even equilibrium correlation functions that describe the microscopic structure of
inhomogeneous ﬂuids can be determined by derivatives of the functional.
In general, the form of the functional Ω[ρ(x)] is not known; deriving the exact

20

Beisbart et al.

functional would be equivalent to solving the statistical mechanics for ﬂuid sys-
tems exactly which seems to be an impossible task. Therefore, one has to restrict
oneself to reasonable approximations for Ω[ρ(x)]. For convenience, one separates
an excess intrinsic free energy functional fex[
] from exactly known external

In contrast to the deﬁnition (1.6) and the applications considered in the previous

that for inhomogeneous densities the vector valuations W 0,1

not vanish for a convex body K and that the functionals do inherently depend

This functional yields excellent results for thermodynamic quantities and for
structures in the ﬂuid phase of hard spherical molecules [35]. For instance, in
Figure 1.13 the inhomogeneous density proﬁle ρ(z) close to a hard wall is shown
as compared to simulation results.
Unfortunately, the functional in Eq. (1.23) was derived only for hard spheres in
three dimensions; however, a proposal has been made for general convex bodies

ately the low-density limit of the intrinsic free energy given by Eq. (1.23). But
unfortunately the last term on the right hand side of Eq. (1.24) vanishes only for
spheres, so that only for hard spheres a ﬁnite number of Minkowski functionals
is, by accident, suﬃcient to decompose the excess free energy into contributions
stemming alone from the individual bodies, whereas for non-spherical shapes in
arbitrary dimensions an inﬁnite number of fundamental curvature measures is
required. Nevertheless, based on the most general analytical expression (1.24),
several approximations by a ﬁnite number of tensor-valued Minkowski function-
als (including the proposal in [34]) may be proposed and numerically tested
which make Rosenfeld’s density functional applicable to general convex bodies,
in particular, to spherocylinders and ellipsoids [26].

1.7 Conclusions

Concluding, we argue that a new perspective emerges as regards the Minkowski
functionals. Instead of marking a small number of distinguished measures (which,
of course, they do in a certain sense), the Minkowski functionals are embedded
into a more extensive class of Minkowski valuations. These measures generalize
the Minkowski functionals without leaving the framework of integral geometry.
The essential step to extend the scalar functionals is to replace the motion invari-
ance by motion covariance. This step yields a hierarchy of tensor-valued measures
with the Minkowski functionals at the bottom. The higher-rank valuations are
moments of the Minkowski functionals where local geometry is weighted with
either the position or the normal vector. The full, comprehensive description of
the tensor-valued measures is still a mathematical challenge, although some im-
portant results concerning the integral geometry of tensor measures have already
been achieved, especially in low dimensions (see [44]).

1 Vector- and tensor-valued descriptors for spatial patterns

23

The extensions of the Minkowski functionals are not only mathematically inter-
esting; rather they can be motivated on physical grounds. Since the Minkowski
functionals proved to be useful for a number of applications, we are justiﬁed
to expect that also their generalizations may be suitable tools. Using physical
applications at various length scales we exempliﬁed how higher-rank Minkowski
valuations complement the information featured by the scalar functionals. From
this point of view we hope that the higher-rank Minkowski valuations will become
a standard tool for morphometry and some other ﬁelds of research concerned
with pattern formation.

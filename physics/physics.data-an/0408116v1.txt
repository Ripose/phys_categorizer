It is argued that the algorithm provides a general and eﬃcient way of cal-
culating SESANS data for any given shape and structure.

1 Introduction

Spin-echo small-angle neutron scattering (SESANS) has recently emerged as a
new way of applying neutron scattering to the investigation of the structure of
matter [?, ?]. The method is particularly useful for large structures in the size
range from 10 nm up to several microns. This is the same size range covered
by techniques like light scattering and ultra-small angle neutron scattering (US-
ANS). The use of neutron spin echo in measuring elastic scattering, however,
renders beam collimation unnecessary, thus avoiding the low ﬂuxes from which
USANS suﬀers.
In comparison to light scattering, the use of neutron allows
for study of opaque or highly concentrated samples. The SESANS method is
presently on an active developing stage, and the theoretical concepts and meth-
ods from which conventional small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) beneﬁts
have only recently started to be derived [?] and be applied to the analysis of ex-
perimental data [?]. As in the case of SANS, the data analysis can be performed
with model-dependent or model-independent methods. In the latter case, the
experimentally obtained scattering functions are inverted to obtain a curve rep-
resenting the pair distance distribution function p(r). The most well-known
realisation for this procedure is the Indirect Fourier Transform by Glatter [?].
Similar analysis can be carried out by the maximum entropy method [?] and
the regularization method of Svergun [?]. Model-independent analysis is par-
ticularly simple in the case of SESANS, as the relation between the SESANS
correlation function G(z) and the small-angle scattering correlation function
γ(r) is given by an Abel integral equation [?], for which there exist standard
numerical methods for solution.

In model-dependent analysis, mathematical functions that model the scat-
tering intensity from a system of particles with presumed shape, structure, and
ordering are ﬁtted to the experimental data. From the ﬁtted parameters one
obtains information such as the size and shape of the particles, their inner struc-
ture and size distribution, and the inter-particle interactions that create ordered
structures. In SANS terminology, the last piece of information is contained in
the structure factor, whereas information pertaining to single-particle scattering
is contained in the form factor. Analytical or semi-analytical functions for the
scattering form factors or scattering amplitudes are known for several geome-
tries [?]. These functions are easy to extend to include core-shell structures and
polydisperse assemblies.

As will be elaborated in the following section, G(z) is related to the SANS
scattering cross section (d)/(d) by a two-dimensional cosine transform [?]. Know-
ing the full detectable (d)/(d) as an analytical function or as tabulated values of
(d)/(d) vs. Q, calculation of G(z) is straightforward by numerical integration.
In principle, it would be desirable and more eﬃcient with analytical expressions
for G(z) for diﬀerent geometries, analogous to form factors for SANS, so that
SESANS data can be analyzed with a similar tool-box of model functions. An-
alytical expressions for G(z) for scattering from single homogenous and hollow
spheres have already been derived using the concept of the mass correlation
function γ(r) [?]. If γ(r) of a given structure is known, calculation of G(z) is

2

simple. For non-spherical geometries, however, expressions for γ(r) can take
complicated forms [?, ?, ?]. Moreover, it is not an easy task to extend γ(r)
from homogenous to multi-domain structures.

In this paper we investigate an alternative method to calculate G(z). It is
for all practical purposes of general validity and straightforward to implement
for any shape and structure. The idea is to perform a Monte Carlo calcula-
tion of the pair distance distribution function p(r), from which the SESANS
correlation function G(z) and also the SANS scattering cross section (d)/(d)
can be calculated by a single numerical integration. Monte Carlo methods have
been used by several authors in calculation of SANS spectra [?, ?, ?, ?]. The
algorithm for calculating SESANS curves is outlined in Section 3. In Section 4
we present results of the calculations for diﬀerent shapes and structures.

2 SESANS Theory

The measured quantity in a SESANS experiment is the loss of polarization a
neutron beam suﬀers by being scattered by the sample. By passing through
magnetic ﬁelds before and after interacting with the sample, the neutrons are
subjected to Larmour spin precession. In the case of no interaction with the
sample, the precessions before and after the sample area cancel each other,
yielding a spin echo preserving the polarization state of the beam [?]. The
presence of a scattering sample produces precession lengths diﬀerences that are
functions of the scattering angle. The ensuing depolarization is a function of
the SESANS correlation function G(z) [?]:

P (z)

G(0)] = exp [G(0) (G0(z)

where G0(z) is the normalized correlation function. The relation between the

where λ and t denote the wavelength of the neutron beam and the thickness
of the sample, respectively. Qy and Qz are the cartesian components of the
scattering vector Q, the incident beam lying along the x axis. The integrations
in (2) are in practice deﬁned by the area in the yz-plane covered by the detector.
The spin-echo length z is a function of the neutron wavelength, the sample
position, and the conﬁguration of the magnetic ﬁelds [?].

We now consider a system of non-interacting particles isotropically embed-
ded in a homogenous matrix or dispersed a solvent. The SANS scattering cross
section can be written in terms of an intra-particle form factor P (Q) and an
inter-particle structure factor S(Q):

(d)
(d)

(Q) = npV 2P (Q)S′(Q),

(3)

where np is the number density of scattering particles and V is the volume of
a particle. Most of the analytical structure factors have been calculated for
systems of monodisperse spheres. The eﬀective structure factor S′(Q) includes
approximate corrections to S(Q) due to particle polydispersity or anisotropy
[?, ?, ?]. We will in the following consider dilute system, for which we may
ignore inter-particle scattering and set S′(Q) = 1, corresponding to an ideal
gas. The form factor P (Q) is related to the average size and shape of the
individual particles and to their inner structure. Focusing on a single particle,
the form factor can be written in terms of the density correlation function γ(r):

where the braces
denote averaging over all orientations of the position vector
r. ∆ρ(r) is the scattering length density at a position r inside the particle,
minus the constant scattering length of the surrounding medium (in most cases
a solvent). D is the largest chord length of the particle, so that γ(r) = 0 for
r > D. For a homogenous particle γ(r) is proportional to the overlap volume
between the particle and its identical “ghost” that has been shifted by a distance
r. For an inhomogenous particle, the volume of the overlapping region must be
weighted with the product of the scattering length densities of the respective
regions [?]. An important identity is [?]:

(∆ρ)2 V =

γ(r) 4πr2(d),

(6)

where ∆ρ is the diﬀerence between the average scattering length density of the
particle and that of the surrounding medium (in most cases a solvent). The
normalized density autocorrelation function γ0(r) is deﬁned through γ(r) =
(∆ρ)2 γ0(r) and has the property γ0(0) = 1.

In this paper we focus on the single-particle contribution to the SESANS
spectrum. A direct real-space interpretation of G(z) was presented by Krouglov
et al. Tim2003. For a system of non-interacting particles, the SESANS cor-
relation function can be written G(z) = λ2tnpGp(z), where the single-particle
SESANS correlation function bears the following relation to the structure func-
tion γ(r):

Note that both G(z) and Gp(z) are dimensionless. Knowing γ(r), the SANS
form factor and the single-particle SESANS correlation function can be calcu-
lated. An important quantity in SESANS is the total scattering probability,
given as G(0) [?, ?]. It relates to the observed depolarization and thus gives an
indication on the magnitude and detectability of the SESANS signal. From the

3 Monte Carlo calculation of G(z)

3.1 Calculating the pair distance distribution function

The pair correlation function γ(r) is related to the pair distance distribution
function (pddf) p(r) by

p(r) = r2γ(r).

(12)

p(r) is the probability of two random points within the particle being separated
by a distance r. By random sampling of distances between points within the
particle, and keeping statistics of the sampled distances, p(r) can be found for
any particle shape. The interval 0
D is partitioned into M + 1 histogram
≤
bins, indexed from 0 to M , D being the maximum distance between two points
belonging to the particle. M = 200 was used for the calculations presented in
this paper.

≤

r

Geometrical points are sampled uniformly from a volume that circumscribes
the volume of the given particle as closely as possible. When Nm = 1000 points

5

have been selected, the points that fall outside the shape function of the particle
are discarded, leaving Nr points. The points are sampled in batches of Nm in
order not to exhaust the computer memory. The shape of the sampling volume
is essential, as it ensures that most of the sampled points will belong to the
particle. This makes the calculations far more eﬃcient than sampling from a
circumscribing rectangular box, discarding the points that fall outside the shape
function of the particle [?, ?]. The sampling volumes are rectangular, spherical,
or cylindrical, depending on the shape of the particle. Uniform sampling from
a given distribution or volume by an inverse method is a well-known technique
in Monte Carlo calculations [?]. For completeness, we give a brief outline of the
procedure in Appendix A For the spherical and cylindrical sampling volumes, it
is straightforward to limit the samling to given segments or sectors. Regardless
of the shape of the simulation box, it is necessary that it encloses the entire
particle ensure that diﬀerent parts of the particle contribute to p(r) in proportion
to their volume. This can also be accomplished by allocating a fraction Vi/V of
the randomly selected points to each domain i. This alternative is particularly
suited for multidomain structures with inhomogenous density distributions.

The algorithms proceeds by calculating the Nr(Nr −
rb|

1)/2 distances deﬁned
2 between the points ra
by the accepted points. The distance d =
and rb is counted into the histogram, wheighted by the product of the scattering
length densities ρa and ρb of the two points. The update of the histogram is
carried out by the following algorithm:

(13)

(cid:18)

(cid:18)

(cid:19)(cid:19)

where the int() function represents truncation of decimals, leaving the integer
index i of the histogram bin. The index i is related to the intraparticle distance
by r = iD/M . Adding 0.5 to the argument of the int() eliminates the problem
overcounting smaller distances because of the decimal truncation.

When the Nr(Nr −

1)/2 distances have been counted, the program checks
the accuracy of the calculated p(i) after a criterion to be described below. If
the accuracy is not accepted, an new batch of Nr points is selected, and the
1) distances are counted into the histogram following
resulting new Nr(Nr −
equation (13). The total number of sampled points belonging to the particle,
ie accepted points, is denoted Np; and the total number of sampled points is
denoted NM .

The normalization of p(i) is done so that the form factor will satisfy P (Q =

0) = 1. This is accomplished by calculating p(i) = ˜p(i)/ (CD/M ), where

is the sum of the distance weights. The last equality in (14) is valid in the limit
of large Np. For a homogenous particle, C will be proportional to the number
of sampled intra-particle distances. Knowing C, (∆ρ)2 can thus be calculated.

6

In most cases the volume V of the particle will be known beforehand. If not, it
can be found from the MC calculations by the relation V = NpVbox/NM , where
Vbox is the volume of the simulation box.

Numerical tests showed that a reliable test for the accuracy of p(i) was
to compare p(i)N , the pair distance distribution function calculated from N
1000. This was done for every time p(i) had been
sampled points, with p(i)N

For homogenous particles, the required number of points lay around NP = 5000.
For inhomogenous particles, the number could be signiﬁcantly higher; for core-
shell particles with equal volumes and opposite signs of the scattering length
densities, values up to NP = 40000 were typical. Nevertheless, calculation of a
full data set G0(z) took only a few seconds on a notebook equipped with a 750
MHz Pentium-III processor.

3.2 Finding γ(r)

To ﬁnd γ(r) from the calculated p(r), Eq. (12) faces us with the problem of
dividing by zero or small values of r2. We overcome this problem by exploiting
the small-r expansion of γ(r):

γ(r) = a + br + cr2 + . . .

(16)

The expansion parameters are known as diﬀerential parameters and are related
to structural features of the particle [?]. The second order parameter c will
in most cases be zero, and the last term could thus be neglected or replaced
with a third-order term dr3. For the sake of the generality of the algorithm,
however, we apply the expansion as given in equation (16). One should bear in
mind, though, that there are particle shapes for which an expansion like (16)
can not be carried out [?]. However, it is valid for most realistic geometries. We
ﬁnd the diﬀerental parameters a, b, c by polynomial least-squares ﬁtting [?] of
ar2 + br3 + cr4 to the Monte Carlo calculated p(r) at small r. For the sum of
squared residuals we have:

Em(a, b, c) =

(17)

(cid:2)

(cid:0)

(cid:1)(cid:3)

where ri = iD/M . Em is minimized with respect to a, b, and c; and the resulting
linear system is solved for a, b, c with standard routines [?]. The summation in
(17) runs from i = 0 to i = m, where the index number m < M is decremented
until the sum of squared residuals Em(a, b) has a suﬃciently low value. When
this is the case, γ(r) up to index i = m is given by a+bri+cr2
i . For the remaining
values of r, γ(r) is calculated directly by p(r)/r2. An example is demonstrated

7

in Figure 1. In the calculations in this paper, the initial value of m is set at
half the distance between r = 0 and the ﬁrst peak of p(r). Finally, to facilitate
a consistent computation of G(z) and G(0), γ0(r) = γ(r)/a is calculated by
normalization.

3.3 Calculation of G(0) and G0(z)

The single-particle SESANS correlation function Gp(z) is calculated by numer-
ical evaluation of the integral (7), neglecting the prefactor 2 (∆ρ)2 V . Having
found γ0(r), we need to evaluate γ0(√x2 + z2) for arbitrary values of x and
z. This is accomplished by natural cubic spline interpolation [?]. The integral
(7) is evaluated using a 16-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature [?, ?]. The nor-
malization of Gp(z) is carried out by dividing by Gp(0), which is calculated at
the beginning by evaluating (7) for z = 0. Subsequent calculations of Gp(z)
are normalized by dividing by Gp(0), thus yielding G0(z). The total scattering
probability G(0) is given by 2 (∆ρ)2 npλ2tGp(0), where the calculation of (∆ρ)2,
if unknown a priori, can be done by means of Equation (14).

4 Results and discussion

In Figure 2 we have plotted the MC-calculated G0(z) curve for a homogenous
sphere with radius R = 50 together with the analytical expression for G0(z) [?].

where ζ = z/R. The agreement between the calculated data and the analyti-
cal function is excellent. The other curves represent MC-calculated G0(z) for
spheres with R = 50, but with radial density proﬁles following a hyperbolic form
α. The density proﬁle has a pronounced eﬀect on the appearance of
ρ(r) = r−
the G0(z) curves and also on the total scattering probability G(0). For the full
2, the calculations gave
sphere, one has l = 3R/2 = 75, whereas for ρ(r) = r−
l = 5.4.

Figure 3 shows the MC-calculated G0(z) for hollow spheres with outer radius
R = 50 and varying inner radii. Comparing G0(z) of the hollow spheres with
that of the full sphere, the interesting feature is the appearance of a small
shoulder at a z-value corresponding to the inner diameter of the hollow spheres.
G0(z) for core-shell spheres with inner radius R1 = 30 and outer radius
R2 = 50 are plotted in Figure 4 for diﬀerent combinations of the scattering
length densities ρ1 and ρ2. Some values of ρ1, ρ2 give rise to strong oscillations
in G0(z), which were also found in the multishell calculations by Rekveld et al.

8

MTR2000. The quantitative interpretation of these oscillations was given by
Uca [?]. Minima arise from correlations between particle regions with opposite
signs of their scattering length densities. Correspondingly, maxima are related
to identical signs in diﬀerent regions, or to correlations within the same region.
The positions of these extrema give information on the typical distances between
or within these regions. Thus, the position of minimum at z = 40 in Figure 4
is related to the typical shell-core distance, which is taken as the core radius
plus half the shell thickness, which in the case shown in the Figure is exactly
70 is due to the shell-shell
R1 + (R2 −
correlations, of which the typical distance, taken as the core diameter plus twice
the half shell thickness, is 80. The core-core correlations are expected to give a
maximum around z = R1 = 30, but this is hidden by the inital part of G0(z).

R1) /2 = 40. The maximum at z

≈

Alternatively, oscillations in G0(z) can be interpreted in terms of the dif-
ferential parameters introduced in Section 3.2.
Inserting the expansion (16)
into (7) shows that each term in (16), except the zero-order term a, produces a
contribution to G0(z) containing a maximum. The position such a maximum is
shifted to higher z for higher order terms. Thus the minimum of G0(z) at z = 40
in Figure 4 can be attributed to a large negative diﬀerential parameter of high
order in the expansion (16). Accordingly, the maximum at z = 70 comes from
a positive diﬀerential parameter of even higher order. Relating such high-order
diﬀerential parameters directly to structural features of the particle in a unique
way is, however, a challenging task in small-angle scattering theory [?, ?, ?].

MC-calculated G0(z) for homogenous and hollow cylinders are plotted in Fig-
ure 5. It should be noted that for cylinders with a high aspect ratio L/2R, the
maximum of p(r) is shifted towards small r. As a consequence, the least-squares
method for determining γ(r) described in Section 3.2 must use a small number
of data points. However, this is not found to pose a serious problem. The G0(z)
curve for the homogenous cylinder shows the same characteristic features as in
the model calculations by Uca et al. Uca2003. For the hollow cylinder, however,
there are remarkable diﬀerences. The SESANS functions are concave at small z,
and there is a clear shoulder at a position corresponding to the inner diameter.
For the thinnest of the cylindrical shells, the shoulder appears to give a disconti-
nous ﬁrst derivative at z = 100. In the corresponding p(r) curve, the maximum
also appeared discontinous. Because of this, it was necessary to increase the ac-
curacy of the numerical quadrature described in Section 3.3 to avoid numerical
artefacts. At the highest z-values, the curves practically coincide, all showing
the loss of correlations characteristic for anisotropic structures.

SESANS functions for core-shell cylinders analogous to the core shell spheres
in Figure 4 are plotted in Figure 6. The inner and outer radii are R1 = 30 and
R2 = 50, and the cylinder length is L = 250. The positions of minima and
maxima can be interpreted in the same way as for the spheres. For the lowest
curve, the correlations are almost completely lost already at z = 100. This
can be related to the fact that for this particular combination of core and shell
volumes and scattering length densities, the overall scattering length densities
of the core and shell are nearly equal, but of diﬀerent signs. Thus for z greater
than 100, corresponding to correlations only along the cylinder axis, the core

9

and shell contributions cancel each other out.

In Figure 7 the SESANS functions for various triaxial ellipsoids are shown.
The case for ellipsoids of revolution have been discussed by Uca et al. Uca2003.
The SESANS functions of the ellipsoids with small eccentricities have been
calculated by sampling points from a circumscribing sphere. For higher eccen-
tricities, a circumscribing cylinder was used. Sampling random points from a
confocal ellipsoidal coordinate system [?] would in principle eliminate the prob-
lem of sampling and discarding points that fall outside the ellipsoid. However,
applying the inversion method of Appendix A to such special coordinate sys-
tems would in most cases require the numerical solution of nonlinear equations,
thus loosing the advantage of sampling eﬃciency.

We close this section with a discussion of the eﬃciency of the Monte Carlo
method, with the prospective application of analyzing real SESANS data. The
calculations in this work were performed using the random number generation
ran3 given by Press et al. NumericalRecipes. This is a very reliable routine,
but for the purpose of rapid calculations, simpler generators could be applied.
Although the Monte Carlo method is general, the examples shown are for rela-
tively simple structures. Additional reﬁnements are possible, but to the cost of
increased computing time. Polydispersity would require multiple calculations of
γ(r), as given by Equation (10) and (11), but this would in principle be required
to be done only once for each G0(z)-spectrum. The presence of radial density
proﬁles ρ(r) could be included already in the Monte Carlo sampling procedure,
as described in Appendix A. For a sphere, this method requires that r2ρ(r) is
described by an analytically invertible function. If not, an additional sampling
must be performed, preferrably from a distribution that closely follows ρ(r), to
obtain the desired density distribution. Again, this calculation needs to be done
only once for each p(r).

5 Conclusion

Knowledge of analytical expressions for the SESANS correlation function G0(z)
for a host of geometries and structures would be ideal and eﬃcient for calculating
model curves and analyzing experimental SESANS data. As such expressions
are hard to obtain for complex structures due to the diﬃculty of deriving gen-
eral expressions for γ(r) to be used in equation (7), one has had to apply the
scattering functions from conventional small-angle scattering to equation (2)
obtain G0(z). The Monte Carlo algorithm outlined in this paper represents an
alternative method, which is general and straightforward to implement from the
shape function of the geometry in question. The method does not need any of
the special functions that frequently comes with the SANS scattering functions
contained in (d)/(d).

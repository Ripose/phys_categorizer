Abstract

The problem of splitting eﬀects by vertex angles is discussed for non-

integrable rational polygonal billiards. A statistical analysis of the decay

dynamics in weakly open polygons is given through the orbit survival prob-

ability. Two distinct channels for the late-time relaxation of type tδ are

established. The primary channel, associated with the universal relaxation

of ”regular” orbits, with δ = 1, is common for both the closed and open,

chaotic and nonchaotic billiards. The secondary relaxation channel, with

δ > 1, is originated from ”irregular” orbits and is due to the rationality of

I. INTRODUCTION

Polygonal classical billiards is an active subject of research in mathematics and physics

(see for review Ref. [1]). In view of the null Lyapunov exponent and the null Kolmogorov

metric entropy the rational polygons, formed by the piece-line billiard boundary with the

vertex angles are rational multiplies of π, are known to be nonchaotic systems [1–6]. They

are therefore well distinct from the Sinai billiard [7] (SB) and the Bunimovich billiard [8]

(BB) where classical chaotic motion regimes are due to, respectively, dispersive eﬀects caused

by the circle disk and the squared boundary, and the interplay between boundary segments

formed by the circle and the square. Meanwhile, the rational polygons of m equal sides

and equal vertices (hereafter, the m-gons [1]) revealed [9] positive Lyapunov exponents with

increasing of m. Furthermore, the polygonal billiards exposed chaoticlike changes in the

associated quantum-level spectra [10], which ﬂuctuations are shown [11,12] to be very close

to the Gaussian orthogonal-ensemble-type statistics. In view of the splitting eﬀects by the

angle vertices, polygons do not satisfy the conditions of integrability [2,13]

These evidences for the chaoticlike features of the nonintegrable rational polygons were

recently questioned by Mantica [6] through the orbital complexity analysis. Unlike the case

of the integrable billiards [14], a delicate problem of the interplay between the regular (piece-

line) and the irregular (vertex-angle) boundary segments in polygons cannot be solved in

terms of the ﬁrst-order averaged polygonal characteristics, such as the average-orbit cod-

ing length [6], the mean wall-collision time [14], or the average collision number [15]. As

shown through analysis of the orbit-wall-collision statistics [15], the higher order correlation

eﬀects induced by vertices play a crucial role in the intrinsic dynamics of m-gons. Earlier

this was experimentally corroborated [11] through the quantum-level spectra statistics: ”un-

like the case of the irrational polygons, the long-range level correlation eﬀects are due to

the rationality of vertex angles” [11]. In the case of the curved-by-circle inﬁnite-m ratio-

nal polygon (

-gon) the late-time memory eﬀects arise from the sliding orbits [15], which

∞

have no analog in the ballistic-type dynamics of its counterpart given by the circle billiard

2

(hereafter CB), where the orbit classiﬁcation is well established [16]. This implies that the

quasi-classical approach has no justiﬁcation for the ”quantized” vertex-spliting

-gon that

∞

is geometrically equivalent to the CB. In other words, the quantum-to-classical dynamics

correspondence suggested [6] between a given m-gon and its circumscribing counterpart is vi-

olated [15] regardless of the fact that the geometric correspondence exists and can be achieved

with any precision when m

(with the help of the aforementioned ﬁrst-order averaged

→ ∞

characteristics). This is in agreement with a conclusion on inapplicability in polygons of the

quantum-to-classic correspondence principle. The latter was elaborated [12] within the scope

of the conventional Wentsell-Kramer-Brillouin picture that failed to establish a one-to-one

correspondence between classical orbits and their quantum counterparts.

The issue of the current paper is an investigation of the vertex-splitting eﬀects revealed

in the decay dynamics of ﬁnite-m rational polygons. An analysis is given through the sur-

vival orbit statistics in the weakly open billiards, which boundaries permit orbits to escape

through a small opening. We will see that, similarly to the case of the intrinsic dynam-

ics in the closed m-gons [15], the vertex-splitting eﬀects are dual of vertex-ordering and

vertex-disordering motion eﬀects, that is manifested through, respectively, the orderlike and

chaoticlike behavior observed in the late-time relaxation. The paper is organized as follows.

The recent ﬁndings for the decay dynamics in nonchaotic [14] and chaotic [17] billiards are

given in Sec.II and discussed within concepts of the primary and the secondary relaxation

channels. The weakly open rational polygons are analyzed numerically and analytically in

Sec.III for the cases of small and large numbers m. Discussion and conclusions are summa-

rized in Sec.IV.

II. DECAY DYNAMICS OF THE CHAOTIC AND NONCHAOTIC BILLIARDS

The intrinsic dynamics of the closed classical billiards is commonly considered in terms

of a temporal decay of the correlation functions for certain dynamical variables (see e.g.

Ref. [18]). Pure exponential lost of amount of memory on the initial states is not a unique

3

channel of relaxation even in the chaotic systems (see e.g. Ref. [19]). By studying the chaotic

billiards, such as the SB [19–22], that is dynamically equivalent to the correspondent Lorentz

gas (LG) model [18] and the BB [8,23,24] with a stadium geometry, it has been recognized

that a crossover from the short-time exponential to the late-time algebraic decay is due to

the long-term memory eﬀects on a free regular motion. The algebraic tail of the correlation

functions seems to be vanished only in the case of the fully hyperbolic systems correspondent

to such geometries as the ﬁnite-horizon SB [18,21] (equivalent to the high-density LG) or

the diamond [18]. Qualitatively the same can be referred to the decay dynamics in weakly

open billiards that describes a crossover from a bounded to unbounded orbit free motion.

Such a decay dynamics is initially established by uniformly distributed N0 point particles

(of unit mass and unit velocity) moving inside of the closed planar billiard table and then

allowing to escape through a small opening of width ∆. A temporal behavior of the dynamic

observables can be scaled to the characteristic billiard times, namely

τc =

and τe =

τc.

table. The late-time (t

τe) algebraic-type evolution of non-escaped orbits (or particles)

≫

Nt ∝ N0(τe/t)δ, which time derivation is related to the survival probability, is deﬁnitely

characterized by the decay dynamic exponent δ.

In the integrable nonchaotic billiards, the ﬁrst observation of the algebraic decay with

exponents δ / 1 was given [27] for the case of the square billiard. Recent study of the decay

dynamics in the 4–gon revealed [14] two distinct channels of the algebraic-type slow relax-

ation. The ﬁrst one is due to the regular-orbit motion with the decay dynamic exponent

δ = 1, and the second channel is originated from the ”irregular” orbits induced by the sin-

gular vertex-spliting eﬀects, which give rise to the subdiﬀusion motion regime indicated [14]

by δ ≈ 0.85. Such a kind of diverse dynamical behavior was observed through the survival

orbit spectra deﬁned by a number for the survived orbits and simulated in the integrable CB

4

and in the almost-integrable [1] square billiard (see, respectively, Figs. 5,6 and 3,4 in Ref.

[14]). In both the cases an irregularlike motion is due to orbit families known as, respec-

tively, the ”whispering-gallery” (polygonlike) and the ”bouncing-ball” orbits. Meanwhile,

in the late-time decay of the CB (see inserts in Figs. 3,4 and 5,6 in Ref. [14]) the short-time

living, frequently escaped ”whispering-gallery” orbits, unlike the nonintegrable case, did not

contribute to the second channel of relaxation. Thus, the solely exponent δ = 1 was observed

in the CB.

In the chaotic closed and weakly open (including Hamiltonian) classical systems, pre-

sented by the BB [23,24,28,29], the inﬁnite-horizon SB [17,19,20,22,30,31], and by the low-

density LG model [21,32,33], the algebraic-type decay was numerically revealed [34] by the

dynamic exponents δ

1. Similarly to the nonchaotic case, it has been repeatedly rec-

≥

ognized that the algebraic tail is caused by the ”arbitrary long segments” observed in the

evolution of stochastic orbits [24], or by the regularlike orbit motion due to ”sticking parti-

cles” [29,35]. This implies that in both the cases this relaxation is due to a free motion of

the corresponding trajectories in the inﬁnite (with respect to the observation time) distinct

corridors which are open in the relevant phase space [30–32].

The algebraic-type relaxation channel with δ = 1 (

α) established in the chaotic

≡

[17,19,23,30,31] as well as in nonchaotic [27,14] billiards, seems to be generic for all non-fully

hyperbolic systems with smooth convex boundaries. Its independence of the billiard space

dimension [31], its insensitiveness to details of the boundary shape [14], including that to

a position of the small opening [23], and to the initial conditions [14], suggests that the

late-time α-relaxation arise in classical systems as the universal primary relaxation. The

latter is a part of the two-step relaxation scenario discussed in the chaotic [17] and non-

chaotic [14] weekly open classical systems. This universal scenario was introduced by the

short-time pure exponential and by the ﬁrst-power-algebraic overall orbit decays given by

Nt ∝ N0e−(t/τe)γ with γ = 1, and by Nt ∝ N0(τe/t)δ with δ = 1, respectively. Meanwhile

the real relaxation does not exclude the existence of the additional intermediate transient

regimes approximated by the stretched-exponential form [17] with γ < 1 (earlier discussed

5

for chaotic billiards in analytical [36] and numerical [18] forms), and by other algebraic-decay

forms [30,31] with δ ≶ 1. The escape mechanism of the primary relaxation in the chaotic

and nonchaotic billiards was described in details within a coarse-grained approximation (see,

respectively, Eq.(12) in Ref. [17] and Eq.(15) in Ref. [14]). Unlike the case of the primary

relaxation, the temporal observation conditions (observation windows) for the secondary re-

laxation in the chaotic billiards (δ = β > 1) are shown to be very sensitive to the billiard

geometry [14], to the dimension [31] d of a billiard table, and to the initial conditions [14].

This can be exempliﬁed by the dynamic-exponent constraint 1 < β

d proposed in Ref.

≤

[31] and observed in the chaotic BB [23] and SB [19,30,31] billiards.

The algebraic-type decay of correlations in the low-density chaotic LG is due to evolution

of trajectories within the inﬁnite principal and/or ”hindered” open corridors [30–33]. In the

corresponding disk-dispersing SB (of side L and disk radius R) with the inﬁnite-horizon

geometry (R < L/2) the principal and the ”hindered” corridors, respectively, can be gov-

erned by the limiting disk radii [32] Rα = L/2 and Rβ = √2L/4 and observed through the

established [17] algebraic-tail temporal windows. Thus, the primary relaxation was observed

[40] within the domain Rβ < R < Rα, when the ”hindered” corridors are closed [41]. Under

the geometric conditions 0 < R

Rβ the transient β-relaxation channel was activated and

≤

indicated by the decay dynamic exponents β = 1.2 and β = 1.1, respectively, in Refs. [30]

and [40]. One can see that the primary and the secondary relaxation channels can be geo-

metrically associated with Bleher’s [32] principal and ”hindered” corridors, respectively. The

latter case was additionally characterized [32] as a superdiﬀusive motion regime, observed

earlier in the chaotic [18,20,22,33] and very recently in the polygonal [15] closed billiards.

We see that non-fully hyperbolic billiards, on one hand, are indiscernible within decay

dynamics observed through the primary universal α-relaxation channel. On the other hand,

the chaotic and nonchaotic, the open and closed billiards are well distinguished with respect

to the secondary β-relaxation given by the decay dynamic exponents β > 1 and β < 1,

respectively.

In what follows we give numerical and analytical analysis of the conditions

of stabilization of both the primary and secondary relaxation channels in the weakly open

rational polygonal billiards.

III. ORBIT DECAY IN POLYGONS

We deal with the rational polygons of m equal sides, denominated as m-gons, circum-

scribed below a circle of radius R. The mean collision time τcm = (πR/2) cos(π/m) and

the mean escape time τem = (πR2m/2∆) sin(2π/m) are given with the help of Eq.(1)

through area Am = (mR2/2) sin(2π/m) and perimeter Pm = 2mR sin(π/m). In the limit

m

→ ∞
τc∞ = τ (CB)

one naturally arrives at the circle geometry of the

-gon with the mean times

cR = πR/2 and τe∞ = τ (CB)

∞
eR = π2R2/∆ , both characteristic of the CB. This

demonstrates how the ﬁrst-order dynamic characteristics can be introduced through the

aforementioned geometrical correspondence that takes place between the

-gon and the

∞

CB. Meanwhile the dynamical correspondence does not exist [15] because the vertex-memory

eﬀects violate commutation between of the temporal (t

) and spatial (m

) limits.

A. Small Number of Vertices

Similarly to the closed m-gons [15], let us consider the case of small number of vertices,

with m < 10 , within the scope of the deterministic approach. This is given by generalization

of the regular-orbit description introduced [14] for the particular case of m = 4 and is

straightforwardly based on the fact that the wall-collision angles ϕ (counted oﬀ the normal

to the boundary and preserved by elastic refections) are integrals of motion. This is true

for the integrable billiards where dispersing or splitting eﬀects are absent. A dynamic

description of the regular-orbit motion can be introduced with accounting of the fact that

m (or m/2) sides of a given m-gon, with odd (or even) number of vertices, are dynamically

equivalent [37]. A description of the wall-collision statistics can be therefore reduced to the

collision-angle domain ϕ = [0, ϕm] with

In turn, the ϕ-family regular–orbit sets can be introduced (for details see Appendix) through

by < ... >c, is introduced through the aforesaid ”mean-collision-time” equation. The univer-

sal relaxation channel, associated solely with the regular orbits, is given through numbers

which are the late-time solutions of the relevant decay-kinetics master equation (see Eqs.

(16,17) in Ref. [14]). As seen from Eq.(6), the fundamental characteristics tcm(ϕ), f0m(ϕ)

and τcm are common for both the decay and intrinsic dynamics. The ϕ-set orbit-partial

8

weight Cm(ϕ) and the orbit-overall weight Dm of the corresponding algebraic tails can be

established in explicit form within a certain coarse-grained scheme and directly observed

[14,17]. However an interesting analysis that indicates a departure of m-gons from the true

integrable systems due to vertices can be given through the algebraic-tail weights without

detail calculations.

By taking into account the mentioned equation Ntm =< Nm(t, ϕ) >c, the overall regular-

orbit-decay weight Dcm = C (reg)

cm =< Cm(ϕ) >(reg)

c

immediately follows from Eq.(6). The

validity of this relation can be straightforwardly tested for the integrable CB where the

irregular orbits do not survive in the late-time relaxation. Indeed, in this case C (exp)

cR = 0.206

and D(exp)

cR = 0.214 that follows from the observation (see Tab.2 in Ref. [14]) of the primary

relaxation of the collision space ΩcR . One can see that the algebraic-tail parametrization

of the regular-orbit decay eﬀects in the CB is self-consistent that is experimentally justiﬁed

with a high precision, i.e., C (exp)

irregular-orbit motion induced by vertex-splitting eﬀects.

We have performed numerical experiments [38] on decay dynamics in m-gons with small

number of vertices: m = 3, 4...8. The initial particles (N0m = 106) have been distributed

randomly within the two distinct phase spaces described in Eq.(5) and then allowed to escape

through a small opening ∆

R. The condition τem (= 300) is chosen to be common for

≪

all m and that has been provided with the accuracy of

5% with the help of Eq.(1). In all

±

cases of m

8 the typical algebraic decay is observed [40] within a certain temporal windows

≤

given by, approximately, 101τem < t

103τem. The particular cases of the observed decay

≤

spectra for pentagon and heptagon are exempliﬁed in Fig.1. In general, the overall-orbit

late-time decay in m-gons with small number of vertices do not show noticeable deviations

from the linear relaxation [39] (see the left insert in Fig.1). Thus the partial weights C (exp)

m (ϕ)

are derived from the observed numbers N (exp)

m (t, ϕ) through Eq.(6) with accounting of the

estimated distribution function f0m(ϕ) and the collision times tcm(ϕ) given in, respectively,

Eqs.(2) and (3). These equations were additionally experimentally tested [40] (e.g. see the

9

right insert in Fig.1).

As seen from Fig.1, the observed partial weights C (exp)

m (ϕ) exhibit regular (small) and

irregular (large) deviations from the mean magnitude C (exp)

cm = C (tot)

cm shown by a solid

(horizontal) line. The latter and the regular-orbit weights C (reg)

cm (evaluated with regardless

of the large isolated peaks) are accumulated in Table.1. Through analysis of a diﬀerence

between the overall and partial weights ∆Ccm = C (tot)
cm

C (reg)

cm , one can see with the help

−

of Table 1 that, similarly to the case of the intrinsic dynamics (see Fig.2 in Ref. [15]), the

vertex-splitting eﬀects in the even-gons are more pronounced than those in the odd-gons. In

all the m-gon cases a deviation of the total weights, treated as ∆Dcm = D(tot)
cm

D(reg)

cm (with

D(tot)

cm = D(exp)

cm and D(reg)

cm = C (reg)

cm given in Table 1), exceeds experimental error (

2%)

established above for the integrable SB, and we therefore infer that D(tot)

cm > D(reg)

−

±
cm . This

implies that the irregular-orbit motion is involved into the observed relaxation. On the

other hand, no noticeable deviation from the primary relaxation is indicated in the observed

decay-orbit dynamics when m

8. Similarly to the case of the intrinsic dynamics observed

≤

[6,15] in the m-gons with small number of vertices, we deduce that the regular-orbit motion

dominates in the late-time decay dynamics.

B. Large Number of Vertices

The universal two-step relaxation in open billiards is shared by m-gons with arbitrary

number of vertices [40]. In Figs. 2 and 3 we analyze our numerical results for the late-time

overall-orbit decay dynamics in the m-gons with large number (m = 2n with n = 3, ...6)

of vertices for the cases of relatively small and large opening widths. In general, one can

observe that the decay dynamics of the rational polygons with increasing of number of sides

moves away from that given by the geometrically corresponding CB: the chaotic eﬀects,

manifested by the secondary relaxation channel with β > 1, become more pronounced with

number of vertices. As seen from the observed relaxation of the initially equivalent states

(given in phase spaces Ω∞ and ΩR) is qualitatively distinct, and the open

-gon and the CB

∞

10

are not therefore dynamically equivalent. Moreover, the m-gons with m > 8 do not expose

the algebraic decay with β < 1, characteristic for subdiﬀusive motion regimes in nonchaotic

open systems observed [14] in 4-gon.

In the particular case of ∆ = 0.05R shown in Fig.

, the universal relaxation remains

stable until m = 64, but when m

= 128 the primary relaxation channel turns

m(exp)
α

≥

up to be closed. In other words, the regular-orbit-motion relaxation aﬀected by vertices is

transformed into the irregularlike-motion relaxation indicated by dynamic exponent β = 1.2.

Qualitatively the same follows from Fig. 3, but the upper limit for the α-channel observation

window shows its dependence on ∆, i.e., m(exp)

α = 32 for ∆ = 0.20R. Thus Bleher’s principal

corridors of the regular-motion relaxations are open for 3

m < m(exp)

α

(similarly to the case

of the SB given by Rβ ≤
disk-dispersing eﬀects) are weak [15]. We see that the α-relaxation ( 3

≤
R < Rα that is discussed in Sec.II) when the vertex-splitting (or

m < m(exp)

α

) occurs

≤

as a precursor of the β-relaxation regime, realized for m

≥
Rβ) was observed [40] before the α-relaxation (Rβ ≤

≤

R <

m(exp)
α

, just as in the chaotic SB

case the β-relaxation (0 < R

Rα). Conversely, the observed α-to-β-relaxation crossover in the m-gons, induced by the

interplay between the piece-line regular and the vertex-angle singular boundaries, is similar

to that between the semi-square and semi-circle parts of the stadium boundary. The latter

was deduced [23] in the case of the BB with small (∆ = 0.01) and large (∆ = 0.25) opening

widths, with the observed exponents 1 / β / 2 (see Table 1 in Ref. [23]).

Qualitatively, the eﬀect of closing of the principal corridors in a given m-gon can be un-

derstood by diﬃculties, increasing with m, to draw the long segments of free motion, which

intersect the polygonal sides in the correspondent LG lattice but avoid the vertex angles (see

also discussion in Appendix). By contrast, the β-relaxation revealed in Figs. 2, 3 is asso-

ciated with stabilization of the ”irregular”-type trajectories, which are eﬀectively deviated

by vertex angles. More precisely, the observed order-to-chaoticlike crossover can be under-

stood as a regular-to-irregular orbit transformation of the aforesaid sliding orbits (formed

[15] by ϕ ≈ π/2 -sets with characteristic free-path times t(reg)

cm (ϕ) = τc∞ cos−1 ϕ following

11

from Eq.(3)), which survive in the open m-gons with m < mα, into those, renormalized sub-

stantially by vertex angles, called [15] by vortexlike orbits (with the large, but ﬁnite mean

characteristic time τ (irreg)

cm

= τc∞m/π), which expected to be stable for m

mα ≫

≥

1. Within

this context, the survival conditions of the regular (sliding) and the irregular (vortexlike)

orbits driven, respectively, by piece-line and vertex-angle parts of the open polygonal bound-

ary, can be introduced as follows. On one hand, the favorable observation conditions for the

α-relaxation (or the β-relaxation) should ensure to exclude (or to include) the vertex-angle

eﬀects under the constraint m < mα (or m

mα). On the other hand, in the weakly open

≥

(∆

Pm) m-gon of a side length Lm = Pm/m, the survival conditions for the regular sliding

or irregular vortexlike orbits are satisﬁed by geometric constraints, respectively, ∆

or ∆

Lm. Hence, the α-β-relaxation crossover, observed at m = mα, is ensured by the

condition ∆ = Lm. With taking into account that perimeter in the polygons with large

number of sides is well approximated by Pm ≈ 2πR, one arrives at the desirable criterium

≪

≫

Lm

≪

(7)

mα =

2πR
∆

.

This ﬁnding provides the estimates m(theor)

α

= 126 and 31 for the particular cases of m(exp)

α =

128 and 32 realized in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. We infer that unlike the case of the closed

polygons [15], the vertex-splitting eﬀects in the open m-gons with large number of vertices

give rise to stabilization of the vortexlike-orbit motion.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The mild discontinues caused by vertex angles and relative lengths of the edges is the

central problem of the intrinsic dynamics of the ”almost integrable” polygonal billiards

commonly discussed [1] in terms of the orbit ergodicity, mixing, entropy, coding, complexity

[6], pseudo-integrability [3], spectral level statistics [10,11], and the orbit collision statistics

[15]. The problem is now addressed to the decay dynamics in the m-gons and is discussed

through the orbit survival probability Ψm(t) =

d(Ntm/N0m)/dt
|

|

related to the number of the

12

survived orbits Ntm. The decay spectra given by the ϕ-set regular-orbit numbers Nm(t, ϕ),

are also studied for the case of small number of vertices m.

A general approach to the decay problem based on a simple decay kinetic equation [17]

naturally arrives at the primary slow relaxation of the regular-orbit sets given by Ψ(α)

m ∝ t−2

(see Eq.(6)). We have demonstrated that the universal α-channel, attributed for both the

chaotic [17] and nonchaotic [14] billiards, is also characteristic of nonintegrable rational

polygons. The primary relaxation-motion regime originated from the piece-line parts of

the polygonal table is associated with long-living sliding orbits with large collision angles

ϕ. In the corresponding phase space these orbits are unbounded trajectories (see Fig.4)

that move without splitting at angle vertices along Bleher’s principal corridors. Following

to the simplest polygonal orbit classiﬁcation by Gutkin [1], the regular sliding-orbit sets

can be presented by the ”inﬁnite-past-to-inﬁnite-future” trajectories. They ”never” hit

vertices, preserve the initial linear momenta, and show a regular behavior in the orbit decay

spectra Nm(t, ϕ) (see Fig.1). Conversely, the singular orbit sets caused by the ”inﬁnite-past-

to-vertex”, the ”vertex-to-inﬁnite-future”, and the diagonal ”vertex-to-vertex” trajectories

[42] exhibit pronounced weights Cm(ϕ) in the orbit-decay process (shown by high peaks in

Fig.1). Eventually, they do not play any signiﬁcant role in the wall-collision statistics in

m-gons with small number of vertices limited by, approximately, 3

m

8, and thus the

≤

≤

primary relaxation dominates. This corroborates by our numerical study (analyzed in Table

1and Fig.1) and, in general, is in accord with studies of the closed polygons by the orbit-wall

collision statistics [15] and by the orbit complexity [6].

When the number of vertices is large, the secondary relaxation with the survival probabil-

ity Ψ(β)

m ∝ t−β−1 predominates over the primary relaxation (see Figs. 2,3). The established

domain for the decay exponent 1 < β < 2 corresponds to that known [31] for the chaotic SB.

Qualitatively, the survival probability function Ψ(β)

m can be associated with the distribution

function for trajectories trapped by the strange attractors, discussed in the theory of the

open classical chaotic systems, or with the corresponding waiting-time probability function

[43]. With accounting of ﬁndings for the decay dynamics on the SB by Fendrik’s group

13

[30,31], one can expect that the secondary relaxation is due to the singular trapped orbit

sets that move freely along Bleher’s ”hidden corridors”. Similarly to the case of the chaotic

billiards, the observation conditions for the secondary relaxation in rational polygons are

sensitive to the initial conditions and to the geometrical constrains. Indeed, the β-relaxation

channel turns up to be closed if the initial particle distribution is simulated [40] in the 2D

collision subspace Ωcm. In the case of the 3D Ωm space the secondary relaxation appears

to be dynamically stable under the geometrical constraint m > mα, where mα = 2πR/∆

is given by the α-to-β-relaxation criterium estimated in Eq.(7). As shown, this criterium

meets the favorable survival conditions for the regular-motion regime with those induced

by rationality of the vortices. The latter are generated by the sliding orbits through the

vertex-”ordering” eﬀects and are associated with the vortexlike orbits [15]. As follows from

Eq.(7), the observation window of such a motion disappears in the limit ∆

0, when the

→

vortexlike orbits do not survive in the closed polygons (see Fig.2 in Ref. [15]). Finally, we

have demonstrated that the vortexlike orbits become stable in the open rational polygons

and visible through the secondary slow relaxation common for the chaotic systems.

V. APPENDIX. ORBIT-SET COLLISION TIMES

As shown in Fig.4 for the particular case m = 3, the estimates for the wall-collision times

tcm(ϕ) are found through summation of numbers of intersections n(t, ϕkm) for a trajectory,

induced by a given ϕ-set orbit, considered in the correspondent inﬁnite LG lattice, namely

The estimation procedure can be exempliﬁed by a relation t cos(ϕ13) = n(t, ϕ13)3a3. The

latter employes the fact that a distance between the equivalent walls is 3a3, where am =

[41] Under special boundary conditions the late-time ”bouncing-ball” trajectories in the SB

were excluded by Fendrik et al. (see Fig.4 in Ref. [30]). Thus they observed a pure

exponential decay within the range Rβ ≤

R < Rα.

[42] Note that the diagonal ”vertex-to-vertex” singular trajectories may remain trapped in

the even-m-gons. The ”bouncing-ball” trajectories, formed by ”inﬁnite-past-to-vertex

” and by ”vertex-to-inﬁnite-future” trajectories, can decay through both the α and β

channels.

[44] A geometric correspondence between a given m-fold rotational- symmetry polygon and

the inﬁnite-range periodically translated LG lattice exists only in the cases m = 3, 4

and 6. Meanwhile, one can show that Eq.(A4) works well for the long-living orbits,

when t

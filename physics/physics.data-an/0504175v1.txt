The spectrum of quantum ﬂuctuations of the electromagnetic ﬁeld produced by quantized matter
is determined. It is found that in a wide range of practically important frequencies, the spectral
density of ﬂuctuations exhibits an inverse frequency dependence. The magnitude of ﬂuctuations
produced by a conducting sample has a Gaussian distribution around its mean value which is
inversely proportional to the sample volume. A semi-quantitative estimate shows that the found
noise level is in a reasonable agreement with experimental data.

Measurements of voltage ﬂuctuations in various media show that at suﬃciently low frequencies, power spectra of
ﬂuctuations in all conducting materials exhibit a universal proﬁle which is close to inverse frequency dependence, and
called for this reason a ﬂicker 1/f -noise. Although this noise is dominating only at low frequencies, experiments show
the presence of the 1/f -component in the whole measured band, from 10−6Hz to 106Hz. Also, the following three
main characteristic properties are universally held: The 1/f -noise produced by a conducting sample 1) is inversely
proportional to its volume, 2) is Gaussian, and 3) its part induced by external electric ﬁeld is proportional to the ﬁeld
strength squared.

A number of mechanisms has been put forward to explain the origin of the 1/f -noise. The second property is typical
for resistive systems, and suggests that the ﬂicker noise can arise from resistance ﬂuctuations [1]. It has been also
proposed that ﬂuctuations in the carrier mobility [2, 3], or in the number of carriers caused by surface traps [4] might
explain the origin of the 1/f -proﬁle of the power spectrum. All these models, however, have restricted validity, because
they involve one or another assumption speciﬁc to the problem under consideration. For instance, assuming that the
resistance ﬂuctuations in the ﬁrst of the above-mentioned models spring from temperature ﬂuctuations, one has to
choose an appropriate spatial correlation of these ﬂuctuations in order to obtain the 1/f -proﬁle of the power spectrum
[5]. Similarly, the McWhorter theory requires a speciﬁc distribution of trapping times, etc. In addition to that, the
models suggested so far reproduce the 1/f -proﬁle only in a restricted range of frequencies. On the other hand, the
ubiquity of the ﬂicker noise, and universality of its properties imply that there must exist a simple and universal, and
therefore, fundamental underlying reason. It is natural to look for this reason in the quantum properties of the charge
carriers. In this direction, the problem has been extensively investigated by Handel and co-workers [6]. Handel’s
approach is based on the theory of infrared radiative corrections in quantum electrodynamics. Handel showed that
the 1/f power spectrum of photons emitted in any scattering process can be derived from the well-know property
of bremsstrahlung, namely, from the infrared divergence of the cross-section considered as a function of the energy
loss. Thus, this theory treats the 1/f -noise as a relativistic eﬀect (in fact, the noise level in this theory ∼ α(∆v)2/c2,
where α is the ﬁne structure constant, ∆v velocity change of the particle being scattered, and c the speed of light).
It should be mentioned, however, that the Handel’s theory has been severely criticized in many respects [7, 8].

The purpose of this Letter is to draw attention to another quantum aspect of the electromagnetic interaction,
It turns out that there is a simple and quite general property of the
which is of a purely nonrelativistic nature.
electromagnetic interactions of quantized matter, which may be the origin of the ﬂicker noise. Namely, it will be
shown that the spectral density of the Coulomb ﬁeld ﬂuctuations produced by a spreading wave packet of free charged
particle exhibits an inverse frequency dependence in the low-frequency limit. It seems that this remarkable fact has not
been noticed earlier. We will show also that the spectral density possesses the three above-mentioned characteristic
properties of the ﬂicker noise as well.

However, cutting the region of small ω′ oﬀ the integral (11) shows that for |ω| ≪ ω0 , it is legitimate to use the
simpliﬁed expression (10) for the purpose of evaluating ˜C(r, ω). Indeed, contribution of the high-frequency “tails” of
˜T2(r, ω′), where (10) is no longer valid (ω0 . ω′), to the integral (11) is proportional to 1/ω0 ≪ 1/ω.

To avoid appearance of the non-integrable singularity, we switch from the function T2(r, t) to its time derivative,

The latter integral is well convergent for ω → 0, while its convergence for ω → ∞ is ensured by the factor γ ∼
β(¯q2 + 2mω). On the other hand, the low-frequency limit of the function ˜C(r, ω) is insensitive to the particular form of
the high-frequency cutoﬀ, since the contribution of frequencies ω′ ≫ ω to ˜C(r, ω) is suppressed by the factor ω/ω′. In
view of this, it is convenient to introduce an explicit and more simple high-frequency cutoﬀ instead of β(¯q2 + 2mω).
Namely, in order to be able to use the simpliﬁed expression (10) for ˜T2, we substitute ˙T2(r, t) by the following
expression

where the positive parameter λ is to be set eventually equal to zero. A direct calculation gives

In applications to microelectronics, ω varies from 10−6Hz to 106Hz, the relevant distances r are usually 10−5cm to
10−2cm, Dt ∼ d, where d is the lattice spacing, d ≈ 10−8cm, and m is the eﬀective electron mass, m ≈ 10−27g, hence,
ω0 ≈ 1010Hz, so the conditions r ≫ d, ω ≪ ω0 are always well-satisﬁed. Furthermore, by the order of magnitude,
γ(0, 0) ≈ d, so the second term in the parentheses represents a small correction to unity. Therefore, Eq. (12) can be
simpliﬁed to

˜C(r, ω) = eiωt0 e2γ(0, 0)

This expression represents an individual contribution of a conduction electron to the electric ﬁeld ﬂuctuation. Con-
sidering a large number of uncorrelated electrons in a sample, one should take into account that the corresponding
time instants t0 are distributed uniformly. Because of the oscillating exponent eiωt0 , the magnitude of the total noise
remains at the level of the individual contribution independently of the number of electrons. Therefore, summing up
all contributions amounts simply to averaging over x0 :

where V is the sample volume. To visualize it, one can say that various uncompensated individual contributions
“ﬂicker” in various points of the sample.

It follows from Eq. (13) that for geometrically similar samples, the noise level is inversely proportional to the sample
volume [property 1)]. Also, it is clear from the above discussion that the distribution of the noise magnitude around
the value ˜Ctot is Gaussian [property 2)].

Next, let us consider the case when the sample is in an external electric ﬁeld, E. Under the inﬂuence of the external
ﬁeld, both the electron wave functions and the statistical probability distribution are changed. It turns out, however,
that in practice, the change of the wave functions is negligible. Namely, a direct calculation shows that the relative
value of the correction is of the order

(12)

(13)

where L is the smallest linear dimension of the sample. Using the above estimates for ¯q, L in the condition κq ≪ 1
gives |E| ≪ 1010, in the cgs system of units. In applications to microelectronics, the ﬁeld strength is usually |E| . 1,
so κq ≈ 10−10. On the other hand, the relative change of the statistical distribution function, given by the kinetic
theory, is of the order

κq =

~2me|E|
¯q4L

,

κs =

e|E| l
¯ε

,

5

where l is the electron mean free path, and ¯ε its mean energy, ¯ε ≈ ~2/md2. κs is generally not small. Furthermore,
the statistical distribution is generally analytic in E in a vicinity of E = 0, and hence the leading correction to the
scalar quantity ˜C(r, ω) is proportional to E2 [property 3)].

Finally, for a preliminary comparison of the noise level given by Eq. (13) with experimental data, let us use the
results of the classic paper by Voss and Clarke [5] where the 1/f -noise in continuous metal ﬁlms was measured.
Speciﬁcally, it was found that the 1/f -noise in samples of pure metals (gold) and semimetals (bismuth) was at the
level 10−16V 2/Hz to 10−14V 2/Hz in the case of V ≈ 10−10cm3, ω = 1Hz, |E| = 0 (it is assumed here that the
contributions from external pickup and ampliﬁer noise in the experimental setup of Ref. [5] do not change the above
order-of-magnitude estimate). On the other hand, a rough estimate (with γ(0, 0) ≈ d) of the right hand side of Eq. (13)
gives in this case for the noise level the value 10−14V 2/Hz. A detailed comparison would require speciﬁcation of the
precise form of the function β(z) in the given sample as well as the sample geometry.

To summarize, we have shown that in a wide range of practically important frequencies, the spectral density of
quantum ﬂuctuations of the Coulomb ﬁeld exhibits an inverse frequency dependence, possessing other characteristic
properties of the ﬂicker 1/f -noise as well. According to the above semi-quantitative estimate, the found noise level
is in a reasonable agreement with experimental data. Thus, quantum ﬂuctuations of the Coulomb ﬁeld produced by
elementary particles can be considered as one of the underlying mechanisms of the observed 1/f -noise.

A more detailed derivation of the above relations can be found in Ref. [9].

Complexity measures are introduced, that quantify the change of the natural entropy ﬂuctuations
at diﬀerent length scales in time-series emitted from systems operating far from equilibrium. They
identify impending sudden cardiac death (SD) by analyzing ﬁfteen minutes electrocardiograms, and
comparing to those of truly healthy humans (H). These measures seem to be complementary to the
ones suggested recently [Phys. Rev. E 70, 011106 (2004)] and altogether enable the classiﬁcation
of individuals into three categories: H, heart disease patients and SD. All the SD individuals, who
exhibit critical dynamics, result in a common behavior.

INTRODUCTION

The problem of distinguishing electric signals which,
although look to be similar, they are emitted from sys-
tems of diﬀerent dynamics, still attracts a strong inter-
est. Two characteristic cases of major practical impor-
tance are: First, Seismic Electric Signals (SES) activi-
ties, which are low frequency (≤1 Hz) signals of dichoto-
mous nature that have been found in Greece[1–3] and
Japan[4] to precede earthquakes, may look to be simi-
lar to “artiﬁcial” noises (AN), which are electrical dis-
turbances emitted from nearby man-made sources.
It
has been argued[1, 3, 5] that SES activities are emitted
when the stress reaches a critical value in the EQ focal
area. Second, sudden cardiac death (SD), which is the
primary cause of mortality in the industrialized world[6],
may occur even if the electrocardiogram (ECG) looks to
be similar to that of truly healthy (H) humans. Sudden
cardiac arrest may also be considered as a dynamic phase
transition (critical phenomenon)[7, 8].

Both cases have been treated in Ref.[8], but here we
only focus on the second one. The time-series will be an-
alyzed in the natural time-domain. The natural time
χ is introduced[5, 9] by ascribing to the m-th pulse
of an electric signal consisting of N pulses, the value
χm = m/N and the analysis is made in terms of the
couple (χm, Qm), where Qm denotes the duration of
the m-th pulse. The entropy S in the natural time-
domain[9, 10] is deﬁned as S = hχ ln χi−hχi lnhχi, where
N
hχ ln χi =
k=1 pkχk and pk =
N
n=1 Qn. It is dynamic entropy depending on the
Qk/
sequential order of pulses[8]. Here we calculate the value
of S for a number of consecutive pulses and study how
it varies within the recording (i.e., using a time-window

of certain length Nw sliding, each time by one pulse,
through the whole time-series). Thus, for a window of
length Nw, when starting from the m0-th pulse, we have
S(m0, Nw) = hχ ln χiw − hχiw lnhχiw, where hχ ln χiw =

pk,w = Qm0−1+k/
n=1 Qm0−1+n and χk,w = k/Nw.
This variation is quantiﬁed by the standard deviation δS
(= δSNw ) of {S(m0, Nw), m0 = 1, 2, . . . N − Nw}. The
value of δS may change to a diﬀerent value δSshuf when
repeating the same calculation but after shuﬄing the Qm
randomly.
In Ref.[8] we showed that a distinction be-
tween SD and H can be achieved when calculating both
δSshuf and δS at the same (time-window) length Nw and
then studying their ratio δSshuf /δS(which is labeled by
ν). Here we show that a similar distinction may be alter-
natively achieved if we introduce appropriate measures
that quantify the δS-variability upon changing the time-
window length and, interestingly, their values approach
the value of the Markovian case in SD, who exhibit crit-
ical dynamics. Furthermore, we show that the measures
suggested in this paper exhibit a certain type of comple-
mentarity when compared to those discussed in [8].

In ECG, the turning points are traditionally labeled
with the letters Q, R, S, T, see Fig.1(a). (cf.
In Fig.
1(b) we show, for example, how the QT interval time-
series can be read in natural time). The RR- (beat-to-
beat) and QRS-intervals (cf. mainly the RR) can be
automatically detected[11–14] (which was followed here)
more easily than the QT-. In spite of this fact, we inten-
tionally study here all these three types of intervals for
the following reasons: It has been clinically observed that
the QT interval usually exhibits prolonged values before
cardiac death (see Ref.[15] and references therein). Inter-
estingly, this clinical observation was found[8] to be con-
sistent with the fact that in all SD the δS- (and δSshuf -)
values themselves of the QT-intervals exceed those of H,
see Fig. 2 (cf. the latter distinction between SD and H
cannot be attributed to the allocation error of the QT
interval, see Section VIII of Ref.[16]). Since the latter

systematic behavior is not found when studying the RR-
or the QRS- intervals[8], it is interesting to investigate
here whether a systematicity occurs when employing the
complexity measures suggested in this paper. Actually,
we ﬁnd that the latter measures seem to enable the dis-
tinction between SD and H when using the RR- and QRS-
intervals of the original time-series. Furthermore, and
most interestingly, we pinpoint that, even when solely us-
ing the most easily accessible values of the RR-intervals,
such a distinction seems to be possible if we apply these
measures to both the original time-series and the one
obtained after shuﬄing the Qm randomly. We use here
the QT Database from physiobank[17], which includes
ﬁfteen minutes recordings of 10 H and 24 SD (as well
as recordings from four groups of heart disease patients,
see below). Examples of the δS-values, calculated for the
RR-, QRS- and QT-intervals in the range 3 to 100 beats
are plotted in Figs. 3(a) and (b) for one H and one SD,
respectively. As for the symbols, we use the same con-
vention as in Ref.[8], i.e., δS is used only when the calcu-
lation is made by a single time-window (e.g., 5 pulses),
while the symbol δS stands for the average of the δS-
values calculated for a sequence of single windows (e.g.,
3, 4 pulses). Finally, hδSi denotes the δS-values averaged
over a group of individuals, e.g., 10 healthy subjects.

Before proceeding, however, it might be useful to reca-
pitulate the main diﬀerences of our procedure compared
to several other earlier attempts by other groups. The
reasons why the concept of entropy should be preferred
(compared to other quantities) as discriminating statis-

2

tics in physiological time-series have been explained in
detail in Ref.[8]. Furthermore, the advantages of using
complexity measures based on dynamic entropy (and not
on static entropy, e.g., Shannon entropy), as for example
the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy (K-S entropy), have been
clariﬁed[8]. Earlier attempts in the ECG analysis have
actually used measures related to dynamic entropy. For
example, the so called approximate entropy (AE)[18] or
sample entropy (SE)[19] have been introduced and later
used by other authors (e.g., see Ref.
[20] where AE is
applied beyond other measures; see also Ref.[16]). Also,
Costa et al.[21] introduced the multiscale entropy (MSE)
approach, the algorithm of which is based on AE or SE,
calculating the entropy at diﬀerent scales. As for the
S, which is also a dynamic entropy, as already men-
tioned, diﬀers essentially from the other ones, because
it is deﬁned[9, 10] in an entirely diﬀerent time-domain
(see Fig.1(b)). Moreover, the following has been found:
When studying the S-values themselves, most SES activ-
ities can be clearly distinguished[10] from the majority of
AN, because they have S-values smaller and larger, re-
spectively, than the value Su = 0.0966 of the “uniform”
distribution (as the latter was deﬁned in Refs.[10, 22]); on
the other hand, when dealing with ECG they all have S-
values comparable, more or less, to Su [8], see also [16],
thus not allowing a clear distinction among their prin-
cipal categories (cf. the entropy values themselves have
been used in earlier attempts). This is achieved, however,
when we quantify the S ﬂuctuations[8] and use ratios of
“shuﬄed” and “unshuﬄed” S ﬂuctuations on ﬁxed time
scales[8] or ratios on diﬀerent time scales that will be
introduced here in Section II. Thus, in order to discrimi-
nate similar looking electric signals emitted from systems
of diﬀerent dynamics, the following seems to hold: sig-
nals that have S-values more or less comparable to Su
(which is the case of all ECG) can be better classiﬁed by
the complexity measures relevant to the ﬂuctuations δS
of the entropy; if the S-values markedly diﬀer from Su
(which is usually -but not always- the case of SES and
AN), the classiﬁcation of these signals should be prefer-
ably made by the use of the S-values themselves.

AND H

however, the meaning of entropy and its treatment should
be handled with great caution (e.g., [1]), because there
[23]) no uniﬁed statisti-
is at present (e.g., see Ref.
cal mechanical theory underlying these systems.
(cf.
In transformations between non-equilibrium stationary
states, entropy might be a not well deﬁned concept[24];
the connection of the entropy to microscopic dynamics is
still a matter of intensive research (e.g.,[25] and references

therein)). In complex systems operating far from equi-
librium (like the case of heart dynamics[26]), long-range
correlations play an important role (cf. such correlations
are, of course, of prominent importance in equilibrium
systems as well, when approaching a critical point, e.g.,
the “critical” temperature Tc, i.e., T → Tc). Thus, in
the latter systems both correlations (i.e., short- and long-
range), in general, is advisable to be studied carefully and
hence appropriate complexity measures should be envis-
aged. This is, in simple words, the physics underlying the
present paper and stimulated the procedure followed.

these

Along

lines, we

introduce
the
δSi(QRS)/δSj(QRS)

ratios
δSi(RR)/δSj(RR),
and
δSi(QT )/δSj(QT ) for the RR-, QRS- and QT-intervals,
respectively, where i, j denote the time-window length
used in the calculation of δS. Assuming that j < i,
these three ratios provide measures of the δS- variability
when a scale i changes to a scale j. We select as a
common scale (for all RR-, QRS- and QT-) the smallest
j-value allowed for the natural time-domain analysis,
i.e., j = 3 beats, and for the short range (s) i = 5,
while for the longer (L) i = 60 beats. Thus, the
following ratios are studied: λs(τ ) ≡ δS5(τ )/δS3(τ ) and
λL(τ ) ≡ δS60(τ )/δS3(τ ), where τ denotes the type of
interval, i.e., τ =RR, QRS or QT. We also deﬁne the
ratios ρi(τ ) = δSi(RR)/δSi(τ ), which provide a relative
measure of the δS-values of the RR-intervals compared
to either QRS- or QT- (for the same number of beats i).
Here, we will use for the short range ρs(τ ) ≡ ρ3(τ ) and
for the long range ρL(τ ) ≡ ρ60(τ ).

The calculated values for the complexity measures
λκ, ρκ (where κ denotes either the short, κ = s, or the
longer, κ = L, range) are given, for all H and SD, in Table
I. The minima minH [λκ(τ )] and maxima maxH [λκ(τ )]
among the healthy individuals for the RR (τ =RR) and
QRS (τ =QRS) intervals are also inserted in this Table.
We also include the corresponding minima minH [ρκ(τ )]
and maxima maxH [ρκ(τ )] for (the relative δS-variability
measure) ρ. For the sake of simplicity, they are labelled
Hmin and Hmax, respectively (and jointly named H-
limits). The superscripts ‘a’ and ‘b’ show the cases of
SD which have smaller and larger values than Hmin and
Hmax, respectively.
In two individuals, i.e., sel41 and
sel51, it is uncertain whether their measure λs(QRS) vi-
olates the value Hmin=1.15.

Table I reveals that all SD violate one or more
H−limits of λs(RR), λL(RR), ρs(QRS) and ρL(QRS),
and hence can be distinguished from H. In other words,
the δS-variability measures of the RR-intervals, together
with their relative ones with respect to the QRS- (i.e.,
four parameters in total), seem to achieve a distinction
between SD and H. Note that λκ(RR) alone can clas-
sify the vast majority of SD. Furthermore, attention is
drawn to the point that if we also consider the λκ(τ )
values calculated ( not
in the original, but) in the ran-
domized (“shuﬄed”) sequence of Qm, we ﬁnd that all SD
violate one or more H-limits of λκ(RR) and λκ,shuf (RR)
(see Table VII of Ref.[16]). This allows (cf. using again

four parameters in total) the distinction of SD from H by
using the RR-intervals only.

Thus, we found that among the 10 parameters deﬁned
in the original time-series extracted from each ECG (or
20 parameters, in total, if we also account for the corre-
sponding parameters deﬁned in the series obtained after
shuﬄing the Qm randomly), only four are required for
the distinction between SD and H. We clarify that this
seems to be extremely diﬃcult to be achieved by chance.
In order to visualize it, if we assume (for the sake of con-
venience only) independent and identically distributed
(iid) distributions of the parameters for one subject, we
ﬁnd that the probability that all 4 parameters are within
the bounds (minima and maxima) set by 10 other sub-
jects (i.e., the healthy ones) is (1 − 2/11)4 ≈ 0.448. Thus,
the probability that all 24 additional subjects are classi-
ﬁed as SD by pure chance is (1 − 0.448)24 ≈ 6.4 × 10−7,
i.e., extremely small. Concerning the validity of this sta-
tistical argument, we clarify that it does not remain valid
if one just picks 4 parameters out of the original 20 ones.
Only if one decides which parameters wants to use before
the calculation of the values, the argument is valid(This
is the reason why blind evaluation- deﬁning all methods,
parameters and criteria studying one set of data, and
then testing the signiﬁcance using an additonal set of in-
dependent data- is considered very important in medical
applications and/or publications).

present results, the main feature of which focuses on
the fact that both ratios λs(RR) and λL(RR) become
smaller,
in the vast majority of SD, compared to H.
Recall that the δS(RR)-values themselves cannot dis-
tinguish SD from H, see Fig. 4(a), in contrast to the
ratios δSi(RR)/δS3(RR), see Fig. 4(b). Before pro-
ceeding, we mention two points: First, for individuals
at high risk of sudden death, fractal organization (long
range correlations) breaks down (see Refs.[26, 27] and
references therein). The breakdown of fractal physio-
logic complexity is often accompanied by emergence of
uncorrelated randomness or excessive order (e.g., peri-
odic oscillations appear in the heart rate recordings of
“frequency”≈1/min, which are associated with Cheyne-
Stokes breathing) [26]. Second, if we calculate[8, 10] the
δS-values in a (dichotomous) Markovian (M) time-series
(exponentially distributed pulses), for a total number of
N=103 pulses (i.e., length comparable to that of the ECG
analyzed here), we ﬁnd that these values: (a) lead to
λs(M) = 1.20 ± 0.03 and (b) diﬀer drastically, see Fig.
4(a), from the δS(RR)-values themselves of both SD and
H (thus indicating that they exhibit non-Markovian be-

havior on the whole; this is consistent with the aspects
that bodily rhythms, such as the heart beat, show com-
plex dynamics, e.g., [26, 27]). The fact that λs(RR) in
SD becomes smaller than in H can now be understood
as follows: Since H exhibit a high order of complexity, it
is expected that (even) their Hmin-value (=1.43), should
markedly exceed λs(M). On the other hand, in SD this
high complexity is lost, and hence their λs(RR) values
naturally approach λs(M), thus becoming smaller. In-
terestingly, the SD average value of λs(RR) in Table I is
1.19, i.e., coincides with λs(M). (Such a coincidence also
occurs for the QRS-intervals in both H and SD, which
agrees with the observations[15] mentioned above that
the prolonged QT-intervals in SD mainly originate from
enlarged ST-values, while their QRS- may remain the
same.) We now proceed to the interpretation of our re-
sults related to the ratio λL(RR). In H, it is expected
that (in view of the RR long range correlations[26]) the
corresponding values must be appreciably larger than
λL(M) = 0.64 ± 0.05, calculated in the Markovian case
(Fig. 4(b)). We now examine the SD: If, in SD “un-
correlated randomness” appears, this reﬂects that their
λL(RR) values naturally approach λL(M), thus becom-
ing smaller (compared to H); this actually occurs in the
vast majority of SD in Table I. If in SD the aforemen-
tioned periodicities appear, it is naturally expected to
ﬁnd large (see Ref.[16]) δS-values when a time-window of
length around 60 beats, or so (i.e., related to the afore-
mentioned “frequency”≈1/min) sweeps through the RR
time-series, thus resulting in δS-values even larger than
those in H (since in H no such periodicities appear). The
latter actually occurs in the few cases marked with su-
perscript ‘b’ (i.e., those exceeding Hmax) in Table I (For
additional arguments on the interpretation see [16]).

The fact that the overall behavior of the complexity
measures introduced in this paper (i.e., clear distinc-
tion of SD from H) is more or less similar to that of
the measures discussed in Ref.[8] does not mean that
the former measures are similar to the latter, because,
as we shall explain below they exhibit a certain type of
complementarity in the following sense:
if in the frame
of the one procedure an ambiguity emerges in the dis-
tinction between SD and H, the other procedure gives
a clear answer. (Recall that, as mentioned in Section I,
in Ref.[8] we discussed entropy ﬂuctuations -and ratios
of “shuﬄed” and “unshuﬄed” entropy ﬂuctuations- on
ﬁxed time scales, while here we study entropy ﬂuctua-
tions on diﬀerent time scales.) This is consistent with
the ﬁndings of Ashkenazy et al.[28] that an approach
dealing with ratios on the same time scale and an ap-
proach dealing with ratios on diﬀerent time scales (or
corresponding scaling exponents) are somewhat comple-
mentary. We now study, as an example, the following
two procedures:
i.e., the one that uses δS(QT)[8] and
the other which combines the measures λ,ρ. The -values
of SD and H given in the last column of Table I are classi-
ﬁed into two classes: the larger values correspond to SD,
and the lower ones correspond to H (see also Figs. 2 and

5

5 ). Let us focus on the two lowermost SD values and the
uppermost H value. The former two correspond to sel33
and sel34 δS3−4(QT)=0.00076 and 0.00069, respectively)
and the latter one to sel16795 (δS3−4(QT)=0.00056).
In view of their δS3−4(QT)-values proximity, one may
wonder whether these two SD could be confused with
H. This ambiguity can be dissolved in the light of the
other procedure (i.e., λ, ρ), as follows: Table I reveals
that sel33 markedly violates both the Hmin-limit for
λs(QRS) as well as Hmin for λs(RR) (the latter can
be visualized in Fig. 6). As for sel34, the Hmax-limit
of λL(QRS) is strongly violated. We now turn to an
alternative example, i.e., sel47, who, by means of the
method using the complexity measures λ, ρ (of the RR-
and QRS-intervals), could be confused with H, because
a deviation of only around 12% from the Hmin-limit of
minH [ρs(QRS)] = 0.18 is noticed. This ambiguity can
be dissolved by means of the procedure using δS(QT)
as follows: sel47 has δS3−4(QT)=0.0029 , which exceeds
signiﬁcantly, i.e., by a factor 5, the corresponding value of
sel16795, who has the largest δS3−4(QT)=0.00056 value
among the H.

III. THE PROCEDURE TO DISTINGUISH SD
FROM PATIENTS

This Section aims at distinguishing SD from patients,
where the latter terminology refers to individuals suﬀer-
ing only from heart diseases. The QT-Database of phys-
iobank we use here, includes the following four groups
of patients (a ﬁfth group that consists of 4 individuals
only, was disregarded for the reasons discussed in Ref.[8]):
15 individuals from MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (la-
beled hereafter MIT), 13 from MIT-BIH Supraventricu-
lar Arrhythmia Database (MSV), 33 from the European
ST-T Database (EST) and 6 from MIT-BIH ST change
Database (MST). The values of λ, ρ, ν,δS3−4(QT),
λshuf , ρshuf and δS3−4,shuf (QT) of all these patients
are given in Ref.[16].

An inspection of the measures λ, ρ, ν shows three facts:
First, all SD and all patients violate one or more H-
limits. Second, none of the measures λ, ρ, ν alone, or a
combination of two of them, can eﬀectively diﬀerentiate
the SD from the patients. Third, if we consider the three
measures λ, ρ, ν (i.e., 16 parameters) altogether, we ﬁnd
that twenty SD out of 24 violate some of the limits of both
patients and H, thus allowing in principle a distinction
of the vast majority of SD from the other individuals.
Thus, in summary, the consideration of the quantities
(λ, ρ, ν) only, does not lead to a distinction between all
SD and patients. The same conclusion is drawn if we
alternatively consider the quantities (λ, λshuf ,ρ) only.

We now turn to the investigation of the δS(QT) values.
In Fig. 5, the average hδSi(QT) value for each group is
plotted versus the time-window length. It is intriguing
that the results of the four groups (MIT, MSV, MST,
EST) of patients are located between H (the lowermost

curve) and SD (the uppermost curve). We emphasize,
however, that if we plot the curves for each one of the
101 individuals (in a way similar to that of Fig.2(a)),
we ﬁnd that there are some patients the results of which
overlap with either SD or H. Let us consider only the
limiting cases -i.e., the lowermost and the uppermost
curve, to be called hereafter δS(QT)min and δS(QT)max,
respectively- obtained in each groups of patients. In or-
der to distinguish SD from patients, we must appropri-
ately discriminate the overlap which refers to those of the
patients that lie above the uppermost δS(QT) curve of H;
the latter curve from now on will be called δS(QT)max,H.
Thus, the limits of the patients we are currently inter-
ested in, do not extend from δS(QT)min to δS(QT)max,
since they must exceed δS(QT)max,H, i.e.,

δS(QT ) > δS(QT )max,H.

(1)

The curve which corresponds to the one of the patients,
that has δS(QT) lying just above the δS(QT )max,H cor-
responds to a value, which will be labeled hereafter
δS(QT)min′ . Thus, if we apply the condition

δS(QT )min′ ≤ δS(QT ) ≤ δS(QT )max

(2)

to each group of patients, we are left only with those of
the patients that actually overlap with SD.

We now recall that, as mentioned above, the measures
λ, ρ, ν altogether, which are in fact ratios of δS values,
enable the discrimination of the vast majority of SD from
all the others (i.e., patients and H), while the δS(QT) val-
ues themselves eﬃciently distinguish[8] all SD from H.
This motivates us to investigate whether a proper com-
bination of these two facts can serve our purpose, which
refers to the identiﬁcation of all SD among the other in-
dividuals (patients and H). Thus, we now compare the
quantities λ, ρ, ν, δS(QT) altogether, of each SD, to the
corresponding parameters of only those among the pa-
tients that happen to have δS(QT) values exceeding the
corresponding values of H, i.e., obey the condition (1), or
preferably the more accurate condition (2). Such a com-
parison reveals that some of the 17 parameters of λ, ρ, ν,
δS(QT), in all SD, lie outside the limits of these patients
(cf. the same happens, of course, if we compare each SD
to the limits of H). These results point to the conclusion
that all 24 SD are distinguished from the patients (and
H). The same conclusion is drawn if we consider instead,
the 17 parameters λ, λshuf , ρ, δS(QT). We emphasize,
however, that the study of the estimation errors (see the
Appendix) reveals that the conﬁdence level for the dis-
tinction of all SD from the patients becomes appreciably
larger if we combine all the measures λ, λshuf , ρ ρshuf ,
ν (of all intervals) with the condition (2) applied to both
δS(QT) and δSshuf (QT) (i.e., in reality, we then con-
sider the limits of those patients whom both δS(QT)- and
δSshuf (QT)-values are larger than those in H, as shown
in Fig. 6 of Ref.[8]).

We ﬁnally comment on three points. First, once the
identiﬁcation of SD has been completed, the distinction

6

between patients and H can be made by identifying as pa-
tients the individuals whom one or more of the aforemen-
tioned parameters violate the H-limits. Second, since it
is known that heart rate variability depends strongly on
the age, it is highly recommended that when compar-
ing values of the aforementioned complexity measures,
the corresponding limits should be taken from subjects
(patients, H) of comparable age. Third, we now focus
on the importance of the sequential order of Qm on the
aforementioned complexity measures. We prefer to deal
with the results related to the RR-intervals since it is
known that the healthy heart beats irregularly and that
the intervals between beats (i.e., the RR-intervals) ﬂuc-
tuate widely, following complicated patterns[29]. Let us
investigate, for example, the possibility of using λκ(RR)
alone to distinguish the SD as well as the four groups
of patients from H, i.e., examine whether the λκ(RR)-
values of each individual violate one (at least) of the rel-
evant H-limits. The results show (see Table II) that the
vast majority of SD and of each group of patients is well
distinguished from H by means of λκ(RR). The situa-
tion drastically changes, however, if we use, instead of
λκ(RR), the λκ,shuf -values (see the Tables V to VII in
[16]): only the minority of SD and of each group of pa-
tients can be diﬀerentiated from H. Since the calculation
of the λκ(RR)-values takes into account the sequential
order of Qm, while the λκ,shuf (RR)-values do not, this
points to the following conclusion: It is the sequential
order of beats that inherently contains the primary in-
formation which enables the distinction between the SD
and patients, on the one hand, and the H, on the other.
This might explain why procedures based on the entropy
in natural time (which is dynamic entropy, aﬀected by
the sequential order[7, 8], see Section I) -and hence they
consider the complexity measures mentioned in the pre-
ceding Sections- can achieve such a distinction, while a
static entropy (e.g., Shannon entropy, see Ref. [8]) can-
not.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

First, in SD, the δS-values depend on the length scale
in a way signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from that in H. Hence
these two groups of humans can be well distinguished.
Second, the SD, who exhibit critical dynamics, have λ-
values (being, in fact, ratios of δS-values, as mentioned
above) which approach those of the Markovian case. This
should not be misinterpreted as showing that the corre-
sponding time-series are of Markovian nature, because
the δS-values themselves are approximately one order
of magnitude smaller than those of the (dichotomous)
Markovian time-series (see Fig.
[8]).
Third, the quantities λ, λshuf , ρ, ρshuf , ν, δS(QT) and
δSshuf (QT) altogether, seem to enable the classiﬁcation
of individuals into the three categories: H, patients and
SD.

APPENDIX: THE INFLUENCE OF THE
ESTIMATION ERRORS ON THE PROCEDURES
FOR THE DISTINCTION OF SD

Beyond the error introduced by the use of an auto-
matic threshold detector for the allocation of the corre-
this is largest for the QT- and
sponding intervals (cf.
smallest for the RR-intervals), the following two sources
of errors must be considered[7, 8]: First, an estimation er-
ror emerges when analyzing -instead of the original time
series of length l ≈ 103- smaller lengths l′, which, how-
ever, still signiﬁcantly exceed the time-window lengths
used, for example l′ ≈ 2 × 102 (the errors associated with
the measures in the short range,s, are smaller from those
corresponding to the longer range, L, because for the lat-
ter range the l/l′ values -due to the restricted length of
the records available- are small, thus not allowing more
reliable statistics). Second, a source of (statistical) er-
ror in the results emerges when considering the ratio(s)
δSshuf /δS (i.e., when dealing with ν and λshuf ) instead
of δS itself. While δS may be considered to have a unique
value for a (given) original Qm time-series, the value of
δSshuf depends on the randomly shuﬄed Qm series each
time selected (cf.
such diﬀerences are well known[30]
when dealing with randomized series of ﬁnite length).
This is why the ν-values given in Ref.[8] for SD and H
do not fully coincide with those tabulated in the present
paper. To account roughly for the extent of this statisti-
cal error, we averaged here the δSshuf -values calculated
over a number (e.g. 20) of randomly shuﬄed Qm-series
generated from the same original series and then the cor-
responding standard deviation was estimated.

The ﬁnal results on the above sources, could be sum-
marized as follows: The (percentage) estimation error
was found to be around 10% (cf. this is an average value)
for the complexity measures λ,λshuf , ρ, ρshuf , ν asso-
ciated with the RR- and QRS-intervals. Furthermore,
since the error in the δS(QT) may reach 20%, the esti-
mation error in those of the complexity measures that
involve δS(QT) may be as high as ≈ 30%. Upon consid-
ering such error-levels, hereafter called “plausible estima-
tion errors” ǫp, a study of each of the methods for the
distinction of SD was made. The study was repeated by
assuming larger (percentage) estimation errors, hereafter
labeled “modiﬁed estimation errors”ǫm, calculated from

ǫm = ǫp (cid:18)

1 +

Hmax − Hmin
Hmax + Hmin (cid:19)

(A.1)

for each parameter (see Table VIII in Ref.
[16]). Both
studies led, more or less, to the same results. The cal-
culation, in each study, was made as follows: Each pa-
rameter was assumed to be equal to its value (initially
estimated from the original time-series available) multi-
plied by a number randomly selected in the range 1 ± ǫp
or 1 ± ǫm, respectively) and then each of the methods for
the distinction of SD was applied. This application was
repeated, for each method, 103 times via Monte Carlo
and relevant conclusions have been drawn for both stud-

7

ies. The extent to which these conclusions hold, was also
investigated in the following extreme case: the limits of
the parameters of H (and patients), which are automat-
ically adjusted for each “random” selection of the val-
ues described above, have been assumed to additionally
relax by (extra) amounts equal to ǫp or ǫm.
(Such a
“relaxation” faces the extreme possibility that the popu-
lations of H and patients treated here are not considered
large enough to allow a precise determination of their
limits, and hence future increased populations’ studies
could somehow broaden these limits by extra amounts as
large as ǫp or ǫm).

The following conclusions were ﬁnally drawn concern-
ing the distinction between SD and H (see also Table
III): Among the four methods suggested (i.e., two in
Ref.[8] and two in Section II), the one that uses the mea-
sures λ, ρ (associated, however, with all three types of
intervals, i.e., 10 parameters in total) seems to be robust
in the following sense: when assuming the error-levels
mentioned above, the use of λ, ρ still allow with a conﬁ-
dence level above 99% the distinction of all SD from H.
( Then a calculation similar to that given in Section II
concerning the probability that all 24 subjects are clas-
siﬁed, by means of 10 parameters, as SD by pure chance
-based on the limits set by 10 other subjects- results in
[1−(1−2/11)10]24 ≈ 0.03, i.e., too small.) The conﬁdence
level decreases to 63%, 49%, 32% and 59% , respectively,
when using four parameters or one parameter only as
follows: First: λκ(RR) and ρκ(QRS); second: λκ(RR)
and λκ,shuf (RR); third: νκ(RR) and νκ(QRS); fourth:
δS3−4(QT). If we investigate the aforementioned extreme
case of the additional “relaxation” of the H-limits, the
capability for the distinction of all SD still remains with
the following results: In the case of using λ, ρ (of all
intervals), the conﬁdence level in distinguishing all SD
is 88%, while it becomes appreciably higher, i.e., larger
than 99%, if we use the quantities λ, ρ, λshuf , ρshuf ,
ν, δS3−4(QT ), δS3−4,shuf (QT ) altogether. When using,
however, four parameters only in the ﬁrst three combi-
nations mentioned above, the conﬁdence level decreases
to 90%, 36% and 8% , respectively (and to 77% when
using δS3−4(QT)), even when allowing two at the most
SD -out of 24- to be misinterpreted as being H. As for
the corresponding conclusions related to the distinction
of SD from the patients, these can be drawn on the basis
of the values given in the lower part of Table III.

In summary, the study of the estimation errors reveals
that (if the limits of the parameters will not be broadened
by future investigations) we can satisfactorily distinguish
the totality of SD from H as well as discriminate the total-
ity of SD from patients, upon employing the quantities
λ, λshuf , ρ, ρshuf , ν,δS3−4(QT), δS3−4,shuf (QT) alto-
gether, i.e., the sixth and the last method, respectively
in Table III. These quantities also allow the distinction
of the totality of SD from H (as well as distinguishes the
vast majority of SD from the patients), even if
their
limits will be eventually broadened (by ǫm).

The following remark should be added concerning the

8

number of parameters required to achieve the desired
distinction: In reality, only twelve independent quanti-
ties, (i.e., the six: δSκ(τ ) and the six δSκ,shuf (τ ), where
κ=s,L and τ =RR,QRS, QT) are extracted from the ex-
perimental data. Thus, for example, beyond δS3−4(QT )
or δS3−4,shuf (QT ), eleven additional parameters (out of
26) of the ratios: λ, λshuf , ρ, ρshuf , ν, are in princi-
ple required to be used for the distinction. These twelve
quantities , however, should not be fortuitously selected,
but the following points must be carefully considered:
(i) priority should be given to the eight parameters as-
sociated with λ-values and λshuf - (or ν-) values of RR
and QRS, (ii) using, at least, one ρ-parameter (involv-

ing δS3−4(QT ) or δS3−4,shuf (QT )), and (iii) examining
whether the totality of the parameters used can actu-
ally reproduce the aforementioned twelve δS-values de-
termined directly from the data. However, in order to
avoid the diﬃculty arising from the completeness (or not)
of the aforementioned selection, at the present stage (i.e.,
until an appreciably larger number of H and patients
will be analyzed to allow a better precision in the de-
termination of the corresponding limits), the preceding
paragraph recommends to use -instead of twelve- all the
28 parameters associated with the quantities λ, λshuf , ρ,
ρshuf , ν, δS3−4(QT ) and δS3−4,shuf (QT ).

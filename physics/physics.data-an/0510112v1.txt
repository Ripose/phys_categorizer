We analyse the multi-fractal properties of the traded volume of the Dow Jones 30 constituent
equities as well as the dependence degree between immediate traded volumes for each time series by
using the MF-DFA method and a nonextensive generalised form of the Kullback-Leibler information
measure, respectively. In addition, we introduce a dynamics based on a previous whose associated
stationary probability density function ﬁts for emprirical results of that ﬁnancial observable.

INTRODUCTION

The study of complex systems has become one of the main focus of interest inside statistical physics [1]. Among the
several types of complex systems nowadays studied, ﬁnancial ones have turned out to be considered one of the most
paradigmatic and thus one of the most extensively studied. In fact, several statistical properties veriﬁed in relative
price change (the return) and return standard deviation (the volatility), have enabled the establishment of new models
which characterise systems ever better [2]. Along with the previous two, another key observable in ﬁnancial markets
is the number of stocks of a certain company traded in a determined period of time, the traded volume, v, for which
it was recently presented a dynamical mechanism that leads to the traded volume stationary PDF earlier proposed
In this article we analyse 1 minute traded volume time series, V (t), of the constituents
in previous works [3, 4].
of the Dow Jones Industrial Average 30 index (DJ30) between the 1st of July 2004 and the 31st December 2004.
We investigate some statistical properties, namely, the multi-fractality and dependence degree and we introduce a
dynamical mechanism that provides the same stationary PDF. In order to avoid spurious features, we have removed
intraday pattern of the original time series and normalised each one by its mean value deﬁning the normalised traded
volume, v(t):

v (t) =

II. MULTI-FRACTAL ANALYSIS

A common signature of complexity in a system is the existence of power-law behaviour, which reﬂects scale invariance
so typical in this kind of systems. This scale invariance (self-aﬃnity for time series) can be associated to a single
type of structure, thus characterised by a single fractal dimension, H (the Hurst exponent) [5] or to a composition of
several structures, each one with a certain fractal dimension, and all supported onto a main structure responsible for
the basic scaling properties of the system under study. In this last case we have a multifractal tipically characterised
by its f (ε) curve, where ε is the scaling exponent [5]. In previous works it was veriﬁed the presence of a multi-fractal
structure in returns time series of equities and commodities [6] which allowed the establishment of analogies between

the maximum is ε = 0.71. The greatest value of function f (ε) occurs for ε = 0.51, pointing a slight persistence in the general
behaviour.

ﬁnancial dynamics and ﬂuid turbulence [7]. Our analysis of the traded volume time series also shows the existence of
a multifractal character. The εmin, εmax (minimum and maximum values of the support of f (ε)) and ε∗ ≡ H (value
of ε where f (ε) is maximum) for all DJ30 time series are presented in Tab. I and the mean curve of the 30 time series
analysed is depicted in Fig. 1. Let us focus on the support exponent H. Although previous work showed the existence
of a large spectrum of H values [8], it is interesting to notice that the values obtained for the DJ30, probably the
world’s most impacting ﬁnancial index, presents a mean H exponent of 0.51 ± 0.03 very close to the Brownian motion,
H = 1
2 , indicating a slight persistent behaviour 1. It is also worth mention that the εmin and εmax are very close for
all time series, 0.29 ± 0.03 and 0.71 ± 0.04 in average, respectively. Looking to NASDAQ traded equities (INTC and
MSFT) we verify that their ε values are a bit below the average.

III. DEPENDENCE DEGREE

Scale invariant behaviour of a complex system is also generally associated to the existence of non-linear relations
which introduce some memory in its dynamics. Although the correlation function (CF) is usually able to measure
how much a certain quantity is related with its past value, there are several cases where, although uncorrelated, the
time evolution of observables may have subtle dependences on their previous values which are not detectable through
CFs (e.g. GARCH processes [9]). An eﬀective way to quantify the dependence degree in traded volume time series
we have used a generalised mutual information measure,

Iq′ = −

p (y) lnq′

Z

p′ (y)
p (y)

dy

′ −1−1
where lnq′ (y) = yq
q′−1 , which emerged within the non-extensive formalism based on Tsallis entropy [11]. For
q′ = 1, this is equivalent to the Kullback-Leibler information gain [12]. If we assume that y is a two-dimensional
random variable y = (x, z), we can quantify the degree dependence between x and z by computing Iq′ for p (x, z) and
p′ (x, z) = p1 (x) p2 (z). For this case, it is known that Iq′ presents a lower bound corresponding to total independence
between x and z, I MIN
, which represents a one-to-one dependence between variables
that is given by,

= 0, and an upper limit, I MAX

30 traded volume DJ30 time series. The inset describes the derivative of R in order to q′. The qop values presented in
Tab. I are obtained from the abcissas of the R derivatives maxima. Right panel: The symbols represent the dependence
degree, qop, vs. lag between elements, τ (in minutes), for Walmart (WMT). The dotted line represents a logarithmic function
(qop = 1.41 + 0.01 ln(τ )) illustrating the slow increase of qop.

From this, it is possible to deﬁne a criterion

Rq′ =

∈ [0, 1] ,

Iq′
I MAX
q′

which has an optimal index, qop (where the prime was suppressed for clarity), associated to the most sensitive
dependence degree between x and z and which is determined as the inﬂection point of Rq′ vs q′ curves (see detailed
discussion in [12]). The procedure was applied to TVTS of DJ30 components with x = v(t), y = v(t + τ ) (shown
in Fig. 2) and the results for lag τ = 1 are presented in Tab. I. For this value of τ we obtained a mean value of
1.45 ± 0.06. Analysing the behaviour of qop as a function of τ between elements we observed a slow increase of qop,
i.e., a slow decrease in the dependence degree between variables. These results indicate the existence of a signiﬁcant
non-linear dependence which seem to be present even for large times, characteristic of complexity.

IV. A POSSIBLE DYNAMICAL MODEL FOR TRADED VOLUMES

Let us consider that the traded volume of an equity is governed by the following stochastic diﬀerential equation,

dv = −γ(v −

) dt +

v dWt,

ω
α

γ
α

2
r

where Wt is a regular Wiener process following a Normal distribution and v ≥ 0. The right-hand side of Eq. (1) is
interpreted as follows: the deterministic term represents a natural mechanism of the system which aims to keep the
traded volume at some “normal” value, ω/α. The stochastic term mimics the microscopic eﬀects on the evolution of
v, just like a multiplicative noise used to replicate intermittent processes. This dynamics leads to an inverted Gamma
stationary distribution,

f (v) =

1
ω Γ [α + 1] (cid:16)

v
ω (cid:17)

−α−2

h

ω
v i

.

Consider now, in the same lines of Beck and Cohen superstatistics [13], that instead of constant, ω is a time dependent
quantity which evolves on a time scale T larger than the time scale γ−1 needed by Eq. (1) to reach stationarity. This
time dependence is, in the model, associated to changes in the volume of activity (number of traders who performed
transactions) caused by a collection of reasons (price ﬂuctuations, news, etc.) [4]. Furthermore, if we assume that ω
follows a Gamma PDF,

This approach is probabilistically equivalent to the previous one [3, 4, 14], but it is more realistic concerning the
dependence on v of the Kramers-Moyal moments [15]. In other words, this model is, in principle, a better dynamical
approach [16]. Concerning the measured values of q, θ, α we verify that they restrict themselves to a small interval
in the q values, 1.19 ± 0.02, close to 6

θ = 8.31 ± 1.86. In Fig. 3 we present the best (Pﬁzer PDF with R2 = 0.9953 and χ2 = 0.0002) and the worst (Du
Pont with R2 = 0.9763 and χ2 = 0.001) ﬁts.

With the ﬁtting values in Tab. I we generated TVTS aiming to study multi-fractality and dependence degree (see
Fig. 3). For the evaluation of the time scales γ−1 and T , we have considered the simplest approach, i.e., the ratio
between the two time scales which describe the CF for traded volume and rescale them considering γ−1 = 1. As can
be seen from Fig. 4, there is a fast decay of the CF, related to local equilibrium, and then a much slower decay for
larger times that are due to a slow decay of correlations in ω. This slow decay is consistent with a slow dynamics of
ω, necessary condition for the appliance of a superstatistical model.

V. FINAL REMARKS

In this article we have analysed some statistical properties of the traded volume time series of the 30 equities
that constitute the DJ30 index. We veriﬁed the existence of a multi-fractal proﬁle for these time series with a mean
Hurst exponent of 0.51. Using a non-extensive generalised Kullback-Leibler information measure we have observed
the existense of dependence degree between variables which slowly decreases as the lag between them augments.
The value of H close to the Brownian motion value, 1
2 , enforces the idea that a multiplicative noise structure can
replicate in a good way the average behaviour of traded volume DJ30 equities excluding the anti-persistent series
(H < 1
2 ). Comparing the empirical and model results we have veriﬁed that this model is able to give a good
qualitative description of traded volume [17]. Basically, we veriﬁed diﬀerences in εmin (smaller for the model) and in
the dependence degree (greater for the model), which correspond to the introduction of large scales in the model that
are not present in the data. However, these apparent discrepancies may be solved using perturbative calculus for the
determination of γ [16] and an accurate determination of the ratio between the scale of local relaxation and the mean
traded volume update [18].

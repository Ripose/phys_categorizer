Detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) is a scaling analysis method used to estimate long-range
power-law correlation exponents in noisy signals. Many noisy signals in real systems display trends,
so that the scaling results obtained from the DFA method become diﬃcult to analyze. We system-
atically study the eﬀects of three types of trends — linear, periodic, and power-law trends, and oﬀer
examples where these trends are likely to occur in real data. We compare the diﬀerence between the
scaling results for artiﬁcially generated correlated noise and correlated noise with a trend, and study
how trends lead to the appearance of crossovers in the scaling behavior. We ﬁnd that crossovers
result from the competition between the scaling of the noise and the “apparent” scaling of the trend.
We study how the characteristics of these crossovers depend on (i) the slope of the linear trend;
(ii) the amplitude and period of the periodic trend; (iii) the amplitude and power of the power-law
trend and (iv) the length as well as the correlation properties of the noise. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that
the crossovers in the scaling of noisy signals with trends also follow scaling laws — i.e. long-range
power-law dependence of the position of the crossover on the parameters of the trends. We show
that the DFA result of noise with a trend can be exactly determined by the superposition of the
separate results of the DFA on the noise and on the trend, assuming that the noise and the trend
are not correlated.
If this superposition rule is not followed, this is an indication that the noise
and the superimposed trend are not independent, so that removing the trend could lead to changes
in the correlation properties of the noise. In addition, we show how to use DFA appropriately to
minimize the eﬀects of trends, and how to recognize if a crossover indicates indeed a transition from
one type to a diﬀerent type of underlying correlation, or the crossover is due to a trend without any
transition in the dynamical properties of the noise.

I. INTRODUCTION

Many physical and biological systems exhibit com-
plex behavior characterized by long-range power-law cor-
relations. Traditional approaches such as the power-
spectrum and correlation analysis are not suited to accu-
rately quantify long-range correlations in non-stationary
signals — e.g. signals exhibiting ﬂuctuations along poly-
nomial trends. Detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA)
[1–4] is a scaling analysis method providing a simple
quantitative parameter — the scaling exponent α — to
represent the correlation properties of a signal. The ad-
vantages of DFA over many methods are that it per-
mits the detection of long-range correlations embedded
in seemingly non-stationary time series, and also avoids
the spurious detection of apparent long-range correla-
tions that are artifact of non-stationarity.
In the past
few years, more than 100 publications have utilized the
DFA as method of correlation analysis, and have uncov-
ered long-range power-law correlations in many research
ﬁelds such as cardiac dynamics [5–23], bioinformatics
[1, 2, 24–34], economics [35–47], meteorology [48–50], ge-
ology [51], ethology [52] etc. Furthermore, the DFA
method may help identify diﬀerent states of the same
system according to its diﬀerent scaling behaviors — e.g.
the scaling exponent α for heart inter-beat intervals is
diﬀerent for healthy and sick individuals [14, 16, 17, 53].
The correct interpretation of the scaling results ob-
tained by the DFA method is crucial for understanding

the intrinsic dynamics of the systems under study.
In
fact, for all systems where the DFA method was applied,
there are many issues that remain unexplained. One
of the common challenges is that the correlation expo-
nent is not always a constant (independent of scale) and
crossovers often exist — i.e. change of the scaling expo-
nent α for diﬀerent range of scales [5,16,35]. A crossover
usually can arise from a change in the correlation proper-
ties of the signal at diﬀerent time or space scales, or can
often arise from trends in the data. In this paper, we sys-
tematically study how diﬀerent types of trends aﬀect the
apparent scaling behavior of long-range correlated sig-
nals. The existence of trends in times series generated by
physical or biological systems is so common that it is al-
most unavoidable. For example, the number of particles
emitted by a radiation source in an unit time has a trend
of decreasing because the source becomes weaker [54,55];
the density of air due to gravity has a trend at diﬀerent
altitude [56]; the air temperature in diﬀerent geographic
locations and the water ﬂow of rivers have a periodic
trend due to seasonal changes [49, 50, 57–59]; the occur-
rence rate of earthquakes in certain area has trend in
diﬀerent time period [60]. An immediate problem fac-
ing researchers applying scaling analysis to time series
is whether trends in data arise from external conditions,
having little to do with the intrinsic dynamics of the sys-
In this case, a
tem generating noisy ﬂuctuating data.
possible approach is to ﬁrst recognize and ﬁlter out the
trends before we attempt to quantify correlations in the

1

noise. Alternatively, trends may arise from the intrinsic
dynamics of the system, rather than being an epiphe-
nomenon of external conditions, and thus may be corre-
lated with the noisy ﬂuctuations generated by the sys-
tem. In this case, careful considerations should be given
if trends should be ﬁltered out when estimating correla-
tions in the noise, since such ”intrinsic” trends may be
related to the local properties of the noisy ﬂuctuations.
Here we study the origin and the properties of
crossovers in the scaling behavior of noisy signals, by ap-
plying the DFA method ﬁrst on correlated noise and then
on noise with trends, and comparing the diﬀerence in the
scaling results. To this end, we generate artiﬁcial time
series — anti-correlated, white and correlated noise with
standard deviation equal to one — using the modiﬁed
Fourier ﬁltering method introduced by Makse et al. [63].
We consider the case when the trend is independent of
the local properties of the noise (external trend). We ﬁnd
that the scaling behavior of noise with a trend is a su-
perposition of the scaling of the noise and the apparent
scaling of the trend, and we derive analytical relations
based on the DFA, which we call “superposition rule”.
We show how this “superposition rule” can be used to
determine if the trends are independent of the noisy ﬂuc-
tuation in real data, and if ﬁltering these trends out will
no aﬀect the scaling properties of the data.

The outline of this paper is as follows. In Sec.II, we re-
view the algorithm of the DFA method, and in Appendix
A we compare the performance of the DFA with the clas-
sical scaling analysis —Hurst’s analysis (R/S analysis)—
and show that the DFA is a superior method to quan-
tify the scaling behavior of noisy signals.
In Sec. III,
we consider the eﬀect of a linear trend and we present
an analytic derivation of the apparent scaling behavior
of a linear trend in Appendix C. In Sec. IV, we study
a periodic trend, and in Sec. V the eﬀect of power-law
trend. We systematically study all resulting crossovers,
their conditions of existence and their typical character-
istics associated with the diﬀerent types of trends.
In
addition, we also show how to use DFA appropriately to
minimize or even eliminate the eﬀects of those trends in
cases that trends are not choices of the study, that is,
trends do not reﬂect the dynamics of the system but are
caused by some “irrelevant” background. Finally, Sec. VI
contains a summary.

exponent, represents the correlation properties of the sig-
nal: if α = 0.5, there is no correlation and the signal is an
uncorrelated signal (white noise); if α < 0.5, the signal is
anti-correlated; if α > 0.5, there are positive correlations
in the signal.

III. NOISE WITH LINEAR TRENDS

First we consider the simplest case: correlated noise

with a linear trend. A linear trend

u(i) = ALi

(5)

is characterized by only one variable — the slope of the
trend, AL. For convenience, we denote the rms ﬂuctu-
ation function for noise without trends by Fη(n), linear
trends by FL(n), and noise with a linear trend by FηL(n).

A. DFA-1 on noise with a linear trend

To illustrate the DFA method, we consider a noisy time
series, u(i) (i = 1, .., Nmax ). We integrate the time series

Using the algorithm of Makse [63], we generate cor-
related noise with standard deviation one, with a given
correlation property characterized by a given scaling ex-
ponent α. We apply DFA-1 to quantify the correlation
properties of the noise and ﬁnd that only in certain good
ﬁt region the rms ﬂuctuation function Fη(n) can be ap-
proximated by a power-law function [see Appendix A]

Fη(n) = b0nα

(6)

where b0 is a parameter independent of the scale n. We
ﬁnd that the good ﬁt region depends on the correlation
exponent α [see Appendix A]. We also derive analyti-
cally the rms ﬂuctuation function for linear trend only
for DFA-1 and ﬁnd that [see Appendix C]

FL(n) = k0ALnαL

where k0 is a constant independent of the length of trend
Nmax, of the box size n and of the slope of the trend AL.
We obtain αL = 2.

tinguishable quadratic background signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
from Yη(i). This quadratic background is due to the inte-
gration of the linear trend within the DFA procedure and
represents the detrended ﬂuctuation function YL of the
linear trend. These relations between the detrended ﬂuc-
tuation functions Y (i) at diﬀerent time scales n explain
the crossover in the scaling behavior of FηL(n): from very
close to Fη(n) to very close to FL(n) (observed in Fig.1).

FIG. 1. Crossover behavior of the root mean square ﬂuc-
tuation function FηL(n) for noise (of length Nmax = 217 and
correlation exponent α = 0.1) with superposed linear trends
of slope AL = 2−16, 2−12, 2−8. For comparison, we show Fη(n)
for the noise (thick solid line) and FL(n) for the linear trends
(dot-dashed line) (Eq.(7)). The results show that a crossover
at a scale n× for FηL(n). For n < n×, the noise dominates
and FηL(n) ≈ Fη(n). For n > n×, the linear trend domi-
nates and FηL(n) ≈ FL(n). Note that the crossover scale n×
increases when the slope AL of the trend decreases.

Next we apply the DFA-1 method to the superposi-
tion of a linear trend with correlated noise and we com-
pare the rms ﬂuctuation function FηL(n) with Fη(n) [see
Fig.1]. We observe a crossover in FηL(n) at scale n = n×.
For n < n×, the behavior of FηL(n) is very close to the
behavior of Fη(n), while for n > n×, the behavior of
FηL(n) is very close to the behavior of FL(n). A sim-
ilar crossover behavior is also observed in the scaling
of the well-studied biased random walk [61, 62].
It is
known that the crossover in the biased random walk is
due to the competition of the unbiased random walk and
the bias [see Fig.5.3 of [62]]. We illustrate this observa-
tion in Fig. 2, where the detrended ﬂuctuation functions
(Eq. (3)) of the correlated noise, Yη(i), and of the noise
with a linear trend, YηL(i) are shown. For the box size

(d) are YηL for the same noise with a linear trend with slope
AL = 2−12 (the crossover scale n× = 320 see Fig. 1). (a) (b)
for scales n < n× the eﬀect of the trend is not pronounced
and Yη ≈ YηL (i.e. Yη ≫ YL); (c)(d) for scales n > n×, the
linear trend is dominant and Yη ≪ YηL.

The experimental results presented in Figs.1 and 2 sug-
gest that the rms ﬂuctuation function for a signal which
is a superposition of a correlated noise and a linear trend
can be expressed as:

[FηL(n)]2 = [FL(n)]2 + [Fη(n)]2

(8)

We provide an analytic derivation of this relation in Ap-
pendix B, where we show that Eq.(8) holds for the super-
position of any two independent signals — in this particu-
lar case noise and a linear trend. We call this relation the
“superposition rule”. This rule helps us understand how
the competition between the contribution of the noise
and the trend to the rms ﬂuctuation function FηL(n) at
diﬀerent scales n leads to appearance of crossovers [61].
Next, we ask how the crossover scale n× depends on:
(i) the slope of the linear trend AL, (ii) the scaling ex-
ponent α of the noise, and (iii) the length of the signal
Nmax. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that for noise with any given
correlation exponent α the crossover scale n× itself fol-
lows a power-law scaling relation over several decades:
(AL)θ (see Fig. 3). We ﬁnd that in this scaling re-
n×
lation, the crossover exponent θ is negative and its value

depends on the correlation exponent α of the noise — the
magnitude of θ decreases when α increases. We present
the values of the “crossover exponent” θ for diﬀerent cor-
relation exponents α in Table I.

Finally, since the FL(n) does not depend on Nmax as
we show in Eq.(7) and in Appendix C, we ﬁnd that n×
does not depend on Nmax. This is a special case for
linear trends and does not always hold for higher order
polynomial trends [see Appendix D].

FIG. 3. The crossover n× of FηL(n) for noise with a lin-

diﬀerence ∆ between log Fη (noise) and log FηL (noise with
a linear trend). The scale for which ∆ = 0.05 is the esti-
mated crossover scale n×. For any given correlation exponent
α of the noise, the crossover scale n× exhibits a long-range
power-law behavior n× ∼ (AL)θ, where the crossover expo-
nent θ is a function of α [see Eq.(9) and Table I].

are in good agreement with the analytical prediction
−1/(2 − α) [Eq. (9)]. Note that −1/(2 − α) are not
always exactly equal to θ because Fη(n) in simulations
is not a perfect simple power-law function and the way
we determine numerically n× is just approximated.

To understand how the crossover scale depends on the
correlation exponent α of the noise we employ the super-
position rule [Eq.(8)] and estimate n× as the intercept
between Fη(n) and FL(n). From the Eqs. (6) and (7), we
obtain the following dependence of n× on α:

Application of the DFA-2 method to noisy signals with-
out any polynomial trends leads to scaling results identi-
cal to the scaling obtained from the DFA-1 method, with
the exception of some vertical shift to lower values for the
rms ﬂuctuation function Fη(n) [see Appendix A]. How-
ever, for signals which are a superposition of correlated
noise and a linear trend, in contrast to the DFA-1 results
presented in Fig. 1, FηL(n) obtained from DFA exhibits
no crossovers, and is exactly equal to the rms ﬂuctuation
function Fη(n) obtained from DFA-2 for correlated noise
without trend (see Fig. 4). These results indicate that
a linear trend has no eﬀect on the scaling obtained from
DFA-2. The reason for this is that by design the DFA-2
method ﬁlters out linear trends, i.e. YL(i) = 0 (Eq.( 3))
and thus FηL(n) = Fη(n) due to the superposition rule
(Eq. (8)). For the same reason, polynomial trends of or-
der lower than ℓ superimposed on correlated noise will
have no eﬀect on the scaling properties of the noise when
DFA-ℓ is applied. Therefore, our results conﬁrm that the
DFA method is a reliable tool to accurately quantify cor-
relations in noisy signals embedded in polynomial trends.
Moreover, the reported scaling and crossover features of
F (n) can be used to determine the order of polynomial
trends present in the data.

First we consider the application of DFA-1 to a sinu-

features of crossovers in FηS(n) for the superposition of
correlated noise and sinusoidal trend employing the su-
perposition rule [Eq.(10)]. At the end of this section, we
discuss the results obtained from higher order DFA.

Given a sinusoidal trend u(i) = AS sin (2πi/T ) (i =
1, ..., Nmax), where AS is the amplitude of the signal and
T is the period, we ﬁnd that the rms ﬂuctuation func-
tion FS(n) does not depend on the length of the signal
Nmax, and has the same shape for diﬀerent amplitudes
and diﬀerent periods [Fig. 5]. We ﬁnd a crossover at scale

where k1 is a constant independent of the length Nmax,

size n) the sinusoidal function is dominated by a linear
term. For n > n2×, due to the periodic property of the
sinusoidal trend, FS(n) is a constant independent of the

In this section, we study the eﬀect of sinusoidal trends
on the scaling properties of noisy signals. For a signal
which is a superposition of correlated noise and sinu-

expressed as

and does not depend on the amplitude AS. We call this
crossover n2× for convenience, as we will see later. For
n < n2×, the rms ﬂuctuation FS(n) exhibits an ap-
parent scaling with the same exponent as FL(n) for the
linear trend [see Eq. (7)]:

B. DFA-1 on noise with sinusoidal trend

In this section, we study how the sinusoidal trend af-
fects the scaling behavior of noise with diﬀerent type of
correlations. We apply the DFA-1 method to a signal
which is a superposition of correlated noise with a sinu-
soidal trend. We observe that there are typically three
crossovers in the rms ﬂuctuation FηS(n) at characteristic
scales denoted by n1×, n2× and n3× [Fig. 6]. These three
crossovers divide FηS(n) into four regions, as shown in
Fig. 6(a) (the third crossover cannot be seen in Fig. 6(b)
because its scale n3× is greater than the length of the sig-
nal). We ﬁnd that the ﬁrst and third crossovers at scales
n1× and n3× respectively [see Fig. 6] result from the com-
petition between the eﬀects on FηS(n) of the sinusoidal
signal and the correlated noise. For n < n1× (region I)
and n > n3× (region IV), we ﬁnd that the noise has the
dominating eﬀect (Fη(n) > FS(n)), so the behavior of
FηS(n) is very close to the behavior of Fη(n) [Eq. (10)].
For n1× < n < n2× (region II) and n2× < n < n3× (re-
gion III) the sinusoidal trend dominates (FS(n) > Fη(n)),
thus the behavior of FηS(n) is close to FS(n) [see Fig. 6
and Fig. 7].

the sinusoidal trend dominates and FηS(n) ≈ FS(n). The
crossovers at n1× and n3× are due to the competition between
the correlated noise and the sinusoidal trend [see Fig. 7], while
the crossover at n2× relates only to the period T of the sinu-
soidal [Eq. (11)].

FIG. 7. Comparison of the detrended ﬂuctuation function
for noise, Yη(i) and noise with sinusoidal trend, YηS(i) in four
regions as shown in Fig. 6. The same signals as in Fig. 6 are
used. Panels (a)-(f) correspond to Fig. 6(b) for anti-correlated
noise with exponent α = 0.1, and panels (g)-(h) correspond
to the Fig. 6(a) for correlated noise with exponent α = 0.9.
(a)-(b) For all scales n < n1×, the eﬀect of the trend is not
pronounced and YηS(i) ≈ Yη(i) leading to FηS(n) ≈ Fη(n)
(Fig. 6(a)). (c)(d) For n2× > n > n1×, the trend is domi-
nant, YηS(i) ≫ Yη(i) and FηS(n) ≈ FS(n). Since n2× ≈ T /2
(Eq. (11)), the scale n < T /2 and the sinusoidal behavior
can be approximated as a linear trend. This explains the
quadratic background in YηS(i) (d) [see Fig. 2(c)(d)]. (e)(f)
For n2× < n < n3× (i.e. n ≫ T /2), the sinusoidal trend
again dominates — YηS(i) is periodic function with period T .
(g)(h) for n > n3×, the eﬀect of the noise is dominant and
the scaling of FηS follows the scaling of Fη (Fig. 6(a)).

≈

To better understand why there are diﬀerent regions in
the behavior of FηS(n), we consider the detrended ﬂuc-
tuation function [Eq. (3) and Appendix B] of the corre-
lated noise Yη(i), and of the noise with sinusoidal trend
YηS.
In Fig. 7 we compare Yη(i) and YηS(i) for anti-
correlated and correlated noise in the four diﬀerent re-
gions. For very small scales n < n1×, the eﬀect of the
Yη(i), indi-
sinusoidal trend is not pronounced, YηS(i)
cating that in this scale region the signal can be consid-
ered as noise ﬂuctuating around a constant trend which is
ﬁltered out by the DFA-1 procedure [Fig. 7(a)(b)]. Note,
that the behavior of YηS [Fig. 7(b)] is identical to the be-
havior of YηL [Fig. 2(b)], since both a sinusoidal with
a large period T and a linear trend with small slope
AL can be well approximated by a constant trend for
n < n1×. For small scales n1× < n < n2× (region II), we
ﬁnd that there is a dominant quadratic background for
YηS(i) [Fig. 7(d)]. This quadratic background is due to
the integration procedure in DFA-1, and is represented
by the detrended ﬂuctuation function of the sinusoidal

for
n1× < n < n2× the sinusoidal trend behaves as a linear
trend and YS(i)

ear trend” eﬀect of the sinusoidal is dominant, YS > Yη,

FηS(n) for n < n2× (Fig. 6) exhibits crossover behav-
ior similar to the one of FηL(n) observed for noise with

sinusoidal behavior is strongly pronounced [Fig. 7(f)],

ﬂat region (Fig. 6). At very large scales, n > n3×, the
noise eﬀect is again dominant (YS(i) remains bounded,
while Yη grows when increasing the scale) which leads to
FηS(n)
Fη(n), and a scaling behavior corresponding to
the scaling of the correlated noise.

FIG. 8. Dependence of the three crossovers in FηS(n) for

pends only on the period T : n2× ∼ T θT2 , where θT2 ≈ 1.
(d) Power-law relation between the third crossover n3× and

(e) Power-law relation between the third crossover n3× and

θA3 = θT3 [Table III and Eq. (15)].

First, we consider n1×. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that for
noise with any given correlation exponent α the crossover
scale n1× exhibits long-range power-law dependence of
T θT1, and the amplitude AS —
the period T — n1×
(AS)θA1 of the sinusoidal trend [see Fig. 8(a) and

θA1 have the same magnitude but diﬀerent sign — θT1 is
positive while θA1 is negative. We also ﬁnd that the mag-
nitude of θT1 and θA1 increases for the larger values of

the correlation exponents α of the noise. We present the
values of θT1 and θA1 for diﬀerent correlation exponent
α in Table II. To understand these power-law relations
between n1× and T , and between n1× and AS, and also
how the crossover scale n1× depends on the correlation
exponent α we employ the superposition rule [Eq. 10]
and estimate n1× analytically as the ﬁrst intercept nth
1×
of Fη(n) and FS(n). From Eqs. (12) and (6), we obtain
the following dependence of n1× on T , AS and α:

ment with the observed values of θT1, θA1 obtained from

Next, we consider n2×. Our analysis of the rms ﬂuc-
tuation function FS(n) for the sinusoidal signal in Fig. 5
suggests that the crossover scale FS(n) does not depend
on the amplitude AS of the sinusoidal. The behavior of
the rms ﬂuctuation function FηS(n) for noise with super-
imposed sinusoidal trend in Fig. 6(a) and (b) indicates
that n2× does not depend on the correlation exponent
α of the noise, since for both correlated (α = 0.9) and
anti-correlated (α = 0) noise (T and AS are ﬁxed), the
crossover scale n2× remains unchanged. We ﬁnd that n2×
depends only on the period T of the sinusoidal trend and
T θT2
exhibits a long-range power-law behavior n2×
1 (Fig. 8(c)) which is in
with a crossover exponent θT2 ≈
agreement with the prediction of Eq.(11).

T θT 3,
a power-law dependence on the period T , n3×

and amplitude AS, n3×
[see Fig. 8(d) and (e)]. However, in contrast to the n1×
case, we ﬁnd that the crossover exponents θTp3 and θA3
are equal and positive with decreasing values for increas-
ing correlation exponents α. In Table III, we present the
values of these two exponents for diﬀerent correlation ex-
ponent α. To understand how the scale n3× depends on
T , AS and the correlation exponent α simultaneously,
we again employ the superposition rule [Eq. (10)] and
estimate n3× as the second intercept nth
3× of Fη(n) and
FS(n). From Eqs. (13) and (6), we obtain the following
dependence:

Finally, our simulations show that all three crossover
scales n1×, n2× and n3× do not depend on the length of
the signal Nmax, since Fη(n) and FS(n) do not depend
on Nmax as shown in Eqs. (6), (10), (12), and (13).

C. Higher order DFA on pure sinusoidal trend

In the previous Sec. IV B, we discussed how sinusoidal
trends aﬀect the scaling behavior of correlated noise when
the DFA-1 method is applied. Since DFA-1 removes only
constant trends in data, it is natural to ask how the ob-
served scaling results will change when we apply DFA of
order ℓ designed to remove polynomial trends of order
lower than ℓ. In this section, we ﬁrst consider the rms
ﬂuctuation FS for a sinusoidal signal and then we study
the scaling and crossover properties of FηS for correlated
noise with superimposed sinusoidal signal when higher
order DFA is used.

We ﬁnd that the rms ﬂuctuation function FS does not
depend on the length of the signal Nmax, and preserves
a similar shape when diﬀerent order-ℓ DFA method is
used [Fig. 9]. In particular, FS exhibits a crossover at a

9

∼

T θT2 with θT2 ≈

scale n2× proportional to the period T of the sinusoidal:
1. The crossover scale shifts
n2×
to larger values for higher order ℓ [Fig. 5 and Fig. 9].
For the scale n < n2×, FS exhibits an apparent scaling:
nαS with an eﬀective exponent αS = ℓ + 1 . For
FS ∼
DFA-1, we have ℓ = 1 and recover αS = 2 as shown in
Eq. (12). For n > n2×, FS(n) is a constant independent
of the scale n, and of the order ℓ of the DFA method in
agreement with Eq. (13).

Next, we consider FηS(n) when DFA-ℓ with a higher
order ℓ is used. We ﬁnd that for all orders ℓ, FηS(n)
does not depend on the length of the signal Nmax and
exhibits three crossovers — at small, intermediate and
large scales — similar behavior is reported for DFA-1 in
Fig. 6. Since the crossover at small scales, n1×, and the
crossover at large scale, n3×, result from the “competi-
tion” between the scaling of the correlated noise and the
eﬀect of the sinusoidal trend (Figs. 6 and 7), using the
superposition rule [Eq. (10)] we can estimate n1× and
n3× as the intercepts of Fη(n) and FS(n) for the general
case of DFA-ℓ.

For n1× we ﬁnd the following dependence on the pe-
riod T , amplitude AS, the correlation exponent α of the
noise, and the order ℓ of the DFA-ℓ method:

n1×

∼

(T /AS)1/(ℓ+1−α)

(16)

For DFA-1, we have ℓ = 1 and we recover Eq. (14). In
addition, n1× is shifted to larger scales when higher order
DFA-ℓ is applied, due to the fact that the value of FS(n)
decreases when ℓ increases (αS = ℓ + 1, see Fig. 9).

For the third crossover observed in FηS(n) at large scale
n3× we ﬁnd for all orders ℓ of the DFA-ℓ the following
scaling relation:

n3×

(T AS)1/α.

∼

(17)

Since the scaling function Fη(n) for correlated noise shifts
vertically to lower values when higher order DFA-ℓ is used
[see the discussion in Appendix A and Sec. V B], n3× ex-
hibits a slight shift to larger scales.

For the crossover n2× in FηS(n) at FηS(n) at inter-
mediate scales, we ﬁnd: n2×
T . This relation is
independent of the order ℓ of the DFA and is identical to
the relation found for FS(n) [Eq. (11)]. n2× also exhibits
a shift to larger scales when higher order DFA is used
[see Fig. 9].

∼

The reported here features of the crossovers in FηS(n)
can be used to identify low-frequency sinusoidal trends in
noisy data, and to recognize their eﬀects on the scaling
properties of the data. This information may be useful
when quantifying correlation properties in data by means
of scaling analysis.

parison. DFA-1 method is used. (a) FηP(n) for noise with

FηP(n) for Brownian noise (integrated white noise, αλ = 1.5),
−0.7
and power-law trend with amplitude AP = 0.01/ (Nmax)
and negative power λ = −0.7. Note, that although in both
cases there is a “similar” crossover behavior for FηP(n), the
results in (a) and (b) represent completely opposite situa-
tions: while in (a) the power-law trend with positive power
λ dominates the scaling of FηP(n) at large scales, in (b) the
power-law trend with negative power λ dominates the scaling
at small scales, with arrow we indicate in (b) a weak crossover
in FP(n) (dashed lines) at small scales for negative power λ.

In this section we study the eﬀect of power-law trends
on the scaling properties of noisy signals. We consider
the case of correlated noise with superposed power-law
trend u(i) = APiλ, when AP is a positive constant,
i = 1, ..., Nmax, and Nmax is the length of the signal.
We ﬁnd that when the DFA-1 method is used, the rms
ﬂuctuation function FηP(n) exhibits a crossover between
two scaling regions [Fig. 10]. This behavior results from
the fact that at diﬀerent scales n, either the correlated
noise or the power-law trend is dominant, and can be
predicted by employing the superposition rule:

[FηP(n)]2 = [Fη(n)]2 + [FP(n)]2 ,

(18)

where Fη(n) and FP(n) are the rms ﬂuctuation function
of noise and the power-law trend respectively, and FηP(n)
is the rms ﬂuctuation function for the superposition of
the noise and the power-law trend. Since the behavior of
Fη(n) is known (Eq. (6) and Appendix A), we can un-
derstand the features of FηP(n), if we know how FP(n)
depends on the characteristics of the power-law trend.
We note that the scaling behavior of FηP(n) displayed
in Fig. 10(a) is to some extent similar to the behavior of

the rms ﬂuctuation function FηL(n) for correlated noise
with a linear trend [Fig. 1] — e.g. the noise is dominant
at small scales n, while the trend is dominant at large
scales. However, the behavior FP(n) is more complex
than that of FL(n) for the linear trend, since the eﬀec-
tive exponent αλ for FP(n) can depend on the power λ
of the power-law trend. In particular, for negative val-
ues of λ, FP(n) can become dominated at small scales
(Fig. 10(b)) while Fη(n) dominates at large scales — a
situation completely opposite of noise with linear trend
(Fig. 1) or with power-law trend with positive values for
the power λ. Moreover, FP(n) can exhibit crossover be-
havior at small scales [Fig. 10(b)] for negative λ which
is not observed for positive λ.
In addition FP(n) de-
pends on the order ℓ of the DFA method and the length
Nmax of the signal. We discuss the scaling features of
the power-law trends in the following three subsections.

A. Dependence of FP(n) on the power λ

First we study how the rms ﬂuctuation function FP(n)
for a power-law trend u(i) = APiλ depends on the power
λ. We ﬁnd that

FP(n)

∼

(19)

where αλ is the eﬀective exponent for the power-law
trend. For positive λ we observe no crossovers in FP(n)
(Fig. 10(a)). However, for negative λ there is a crossover
in FP(n) at small scales n (Fig. 10(b)), and we ﬁnd that
this crossover becomes even more pronounced with de-
creasing λ or increasing the order ℓ of the DFA method,
and is also shifted to larger scales [Fig. 11(a)].

FIG. 11. Scaling behavior of rms ﬂuctuation function
FP(n) for power-law trends, u(i) ∼ iλ, where i = 1, ..., Nmax
and Nmax = 217 is the length of the signal. (a) For λ < 0,
FP(n) exhibits crossover at small scales which is more pro-
nounced with increasing the order ℓ of DFA-ℓ and decreasing
the value of λ. Such crossover is not observed for λ > 0 when
FP(n) ∼ nαλ for all scales n [see Fig. 10(a)]. (b) Dependence
of the eﬀective exponent αλ on the power λ for diﬀerent order
ℓ = 1, 2, 3 of the DFA method. Three regions are observed
depending on the order ℓ of the DFA: region I (λ > ℓ − 0.5),
where αλ ≈ ℓ + 1; region II (−1.5 < λ < ℓ − 0.5), where
αλ = λ + 1.5; region III (λ < −1.5), where αλ ≈ 0. We note
that for integer values of the power λ = 0, 1, ..., ℓ − 1, where ℓ
is the order of DFA we used, there is no scaling for FP(n) and
αλ is not deﬁned, as indicated by the arrows. (c) Asymptotic
behavior near integer values of λ. FP(n) is plotted for λ → 1
when DFA-2 is used. Even for λ − 1 = 10−6, we observe at
large scales n a region with an eﬀective exponent αλ ≈ 2.5,
This region is shifted to inﬁnitely large scales when λ = 1.

Next, we study how the eﬀective exponent αλ for FP(n)
depends on the value of the power λ for the power-law
trend. We examine the scaling of FP(n) and estimate

−

αλ for
4 < λ < 4. In the cases when FP(n) exhibits a
crossover, in order to obtain αλ we ﬁt the range of larger
scales to the right of the crossover. We ﬁnd that for any
order ℓ of the DFA-ℓ method there are three regions with
diﬀerent relations between αλ and λ [Fig. 11(b)]:

Note, that for integer values of the power λ (λ =
0, 1, ..., m
1,
1 (ℓ is also an in-
the DFA-ℓ method of order ℓ > m
teger) leads to FP(n)
0, since DFA-ℓ is designed to
remove polynomial trends. Thus for a integer values of
the power λ there is no scaling and the eﬀective exponent
αλ is not deﬁned if a DFA-ℓ method of order ℓ > λ is used
[Fig. 11]. However, it is of interest to examine the asymp-
totic behavior of the scaling of FP(n) when the value of
the power λ is close to an integer.
In particular , we
consider how the scaling of FP(n) obtained from DFA-2
method changes when λ
1 [Fig. 11(c)]. Surprisingly,
we ﬁnd that even though the values of FP(n) are very
small at large scales, there is a scaling for FP(n) with a
2.5
smooth convergence of the eﬀective exponent αλ →
λ + 1.5
1, according to the dependence αλ ≈
when λ
established for region II [Fig. 11(b)]. At smaller scales
there is a ﬂat region which is due to the fact that the
ﬂuctuation function Y (i) (Eq. (3)) is smaller than the
precision of the numerical simulation.

B. Dependence of FP(n) on the order ℓ of DFA

Another factor that aﬀects the rms ﬂuctuation func-

DFA method used. We ﬁrst take into account that:

(1) for integer values of the power λ, the power-law
trend u(i) = APiλ is a polynomial trend which
can be perfectly ﬁltered out by the DFA method
of order ℓ > λ, and as discussed in Sec. III B and
Sec. V A [see Fig. 11(b) and (c)], there is no scaling
for FP(n). Therefore, in this section we consider
only non-integer values of λ.

(2) for a given value of the power λ, the eﬀective ex-
ponent αλ can take diﬀerent values depending on
the order ℓ of the DFA method we use [see Fig. 11]
— e.g.
ℓ + 1. There-

power-law trend.
correlation exponent α = 0.1 and a power-law u(i) = APiλ,
where AP = 25/ (Nmax)0.4, Nmax = 217 and λ = 0.4. Results
for diﬀerent order ℓ = 1, 2, 3 of the DFA method show (i) a
clear crossover from a region at small scales where the noise
dominates FηP(n) ≈ Fη(n), to a region at larger scales where
the power-law trend dominates FηP(n) ≈ FP(n), and (ii) a
vertical shift ∆ in FηP with increasing ℓ.
(b) Dependence
of the vertical shift ∆ in the rms ﬂuctuation function FP(n)
for power-law trend on the order ℓ of DFA-ℓ for diﬀerent val-
ues of λ: ∆ ∼ ℓτ (λ). We deﬁne the vertical shift ∆ as the
y-intercept of FP(n): ∆ ≡ FP(n = 1). Note, that we consider
only non-integer values for λ and that we consider the region
λ < ℓ − 0.5. Thus, for all values of λ the minimal order ℓ
that can be used in the DFA method is ℓ > λ + 0.5. e.g. for
λ = 1.6 the minimal order of the DFA that can be used is
ℓ = 3 (for details see Fig. 11(b)). (c) Dependence of τ on the
power λ (error bars indicate the regression error for the ﬁts of
∆(l) in (b)). (d) Comparison of τ (αλ) for FP(n) and τ (α) for
Fη(n). Faster decay of τ (αλ) indicates larger vertical shifts
for FP(n) compared to Fη(n) with increasing order ℓ of the
DFA-ℓ.

Since higher order DFA-ℓ provides a better ﬁt for the
data, the ﬂuctuation function Y (i) (Eq. (3)) decreases
with increasing order ℓ. This leads to a vertical shift
to smaller values of the rms ﬂuctuation function F (n)
(Eq. (4)). Such a vertical shift is observed for the rms
ﬂuctuation function Fη(n) for correlated noise (see Ap-
pendix A), as well as for the rms ﬂuctuation function of
power-law trend FP(n). Here we ask how this vertical
shift in Fη(n) and FP(n) depends on the order ℓ of the
DFA method, and if this shift has diﬀerent properties
for Fη(n) compared to FP(n). This information can help
identify power-law trends in noisy data, and can be used
to diﬀerentiate crossovers separating scaling regions with
diﬀerent types of correlations, and crossovers which are
due to eﬀects of power-law trends.

We consider correlated noise with a superposed power-
law trend, where the crossover in FηP(n) at large scales n
results from the dominant eﬀect of the power-law trend
— FηP(n)
FP(n) (Eq. (18) and Fig. 10(a)). We choose
the power λ < 0.5, a range where for all orders ℓ of the
DFA method the eﬀective exponent αλ of FP(n) remains
the same — i.e. αλ = λ+1.5 (region II in Fig. 11(b)). For
a superposition of an anti-correlated noise and power-law
trend with λ = 0.4, we observe a crossover in the scaling
behavior of FηP(n), from a scaling region characterized
by the correlation exponent α = 0.1 of the noise, where
Fη(n), to a region characterized by an eﬀective
FηP(n)
exponent αλ = 1.9, where FηP(n)
FP(n), for all orders
ℓ = 1, 2, 3 of the DFA-ℓ method [Fig. 12(a)]. We also
ﬁnd that the crossover of FηP(n) shifts to larger scales
when the order ℓ of DFA-ℓ increases, and that there is
a vertical shift of FηP(n) to lower values. This vertical
shift in FηP(n) at large scales, where FηP(n) = FP(n),
appears to be diﬀerent in magnitude when diﬀerent or-
der ℓ of the DFA-ℓ method is used [Fig. 12(a)]. We also
observe a less pronounced vertical shift at small scales
where FηP(n)

Fη(n).

≈

≈

≡

Next, we ask how these vertical shifts depend on the
order ℓ of DFA-ℓ. We deﬁne the vertical shift ∆ as the
FP(n = 1). We ﬁnd that the
y-intercept of FP(n): ∆
vertical shift ∆ in FP(n) for power-law trend follows a
ℓτ (λ). We tested this relation for orders
power law: ∆
up to ℓ = 10, and we ﬁnd that it holds for diﬀerent val-
ues of the power λ of the power-law trend [Fig. 12(b)].
Using Eq. (19) we can write: FP(n)/FP(n = 1) = nαλ,
ℓτ (λ)
i.e. FP(n)
FP(n = 1). Since FP(n = 1)
∼
[Fig. 12(b)], we ﬁnd that:

ℓτ (λ).

(20)

We also ﬁnd that the exponent τ is negative and is a
decreasing function of the power λ [Fig. 12(c)]. Because
the eﬀective exponent αλ which characterizes FP(n) de-
pends on the power λ [see Fig. 11(b)], we can express the
exponent τ as a function of αλ as we show in Fig. 12(d).
This representation can help us compare the behavior of
the vertical shift ∆ in FP(n) with the shift in Fη(n). For
correlated noise with diﬀerent correlation exponent α, we
observe a similar power-law relation between the vertical
ℓτ (α), where
shift in Fη(n) and the order ℓ of DFA-ℓ: ∆
τ is also a negative exponent which decreases with α. In
Fig. 12(d) we compare τ (αλ) for FP(n) with τ (α) for
Fη(n), and ﬁnd that for any αλ = α, τ (αλ) < τ (α). This
diﬀerence between the vertical shift for correlated noise
and for a power-law trend can be utilized to recognize
eﬀects of power-law trends on the scaling properties of
data.

C. Dependence of FP(n) on the signal length Nmax

Here, we study how the rms ﬂuctuation function FP(n)
depends on the length Nmax of the power-law signal

u(i) = APiλ (i = 1, ..., Nmax). We ﬁnd that there is a
vertical shift in FP(n) with increasing Nmax [Fig. 13(a)].
We observe that when doubling the length Nmax of the
signal the vertical shift in FP(n), which we deﬁne as
F 2Nmax
, remains the same, independent of the
value of Nmax. This suggests a power-law dependence of
FP(n) on the length of the signal:

/F Nmax
P

(Nmax)γ ,

(21)

where γ is an eﬀective scaling exponent.

Next, we ask if the vertical shift depends on the power
λ of the power-law trend. When doubling the length
0.5, where ℓ
Nmax of the signal, we ﬁnd that for λ < ℓ
is the order of the DFA method, the vertical shift is a con-
stant independent of λ [Fig. 13(b)]. Since the value of the
vertical shift when doubling the length Nmax is 2γ (from
Eq. (21)), the results in Fig. 13(b) show that γ is inde-
0.15,
pendent of λ when λ < ℓ
i.e. the eﬀective exponent γ

0.5, and that

For λ > ℓ

0.5, when doubling the length Nmax of
the signal, we ﬁnd that the vertical shift 2γ exhibits the
log10 2γ = log10 2λ−ℓ, and
following dependence on λ:
thus the eﬀective exponent γ depends on λ — γ = λ
ℓ.
For positive integer values of λ (λ = ℓ), we ﬁnd that
γ = 0, and there is no shift in FP(n), suggesting that
FP(n) does not depend on the length Nmax of the signal,
when DFA of order ℓ is used [Fig. 13]. Finally, we note
that depending on the eﬀective exponent γ, i.e. on the
order ℓ of the DFA method and the value of the power λ,
the vertical shift in the rms ﬂuctuation function FP(n)
for power-law trend can be positive (λ > ℓ), negative
(λ < ℓ), or zero (λ = ℓ).

We have seen that, taking into account the eﬀects of

and the eﬀect of the length of the signal Nmax (Eq. (21)),
we reach the following expression for the rms ﬂuctuation

depend on the length of the signal Nmax. Thus we have

VI. CONCLUSION AND SUMMARY

In this paper we show that the DFA method performs
better than the standard R/S analysis to quantify the
scaling behavior of noisy signals for a wide range of cor-
relations, and we estimate the range of scales where the
performance of the DFA method is optimal. We consider
diﬀerent types of trends superposed on correlated noise,
and study how these trends aﬀect the scaling behavior of
the noise. We demonstrate that there is a competition be-
tween a trend and a noise, and that this competition can
lead to crossovers in the scaling. We investigate the fea-
tures of these crossovers, their dependence on the proper-
ties of the noise and the superposed trend. Surprisingly,
we ﬁnd that crossovers which are a result of trends can
exhibit power-law dependences on the parameters of the
trends. We show that these crossover phenomena can be
explained by the superposition of the separate results of
the DFA method on the noise and on the trend, assum-
ing that the noise and the trend are not correlated, and
that the scaling properties of the noise and the appar-
ent scaling behavior of the trend are known. Our work
may provide some help to diﬀerentiate between diﬀer-
ent types of crossovers — e.g. crossovers which separate
scaling regions with diﬀerent correlation properties may
diﬀer from crossovers which are an artifact of trends. The
results we present here could be useful for identifying the
presence of trends and to accurately interpret correlation
properties of noisy data.

APPENDIX A: NOISE

The standard signals we generate in our study are un-
correlated, correlated, and anti-correlated noise. First
we must have a clear idea of the scaling behaviors of
these standard signals before we use them to study the
eﬀects from other aspects. We generate noises by using a
modiﬁed Fourier ﬁltering method [63]. This method can
eﬃciently generate noise, u(i) (i = 1, 2, 3, ..., Nmax), with
the desired power-law correlation function which asymp-

totically behaves as: <

2 >
u(j)
|

∼

t2α. By default, a

generated noise has standard deviation σ = 1. Then we
can test DFA and R/S by applying it on generated noises
since we know the expected scaling exponent α.

for some vertical shift of the curves and the little bend-
down for small box size n. The bent-down for very small
box of F (n) from higher order DFA is because there are
more variables to ﬁt those few points.

Ideally, when analyzing a standard noise, F (n) (DFA)
and R/S (R/S analysis) will be a power-law function
with a given power: α, no matter which region of F (n)
and R/S is chosen for calculation. However, a careful
study shows that the scaling exponent α depends on scale
n. The estimated α is diﬀerent for the diﬀerent regions
of F (n) and R/S as illustrated by Figs. 14(a) and 14(b)
and by Tables IV and V. It is very important to know the
best ﬁtting region of DFA and R/S analysis in the study
of real signals. Otherwise, the wrong α will be obtained
if an inappropriate region is selected.

In order to ﬁnd the best region, we ﬁrst determine the
dependence of the locally estimated α, αloc, on the scale
n. First, generate a standard noise with given scaling
exponent α; then calculate F (n) (or R/S), and obtain
αloc(n) by local ﬁtting of F (n) (or R/S). Same random
simulation is repeated 50 times for both DFA and R/S
analysis. The resultant average αloc(n), respectively, are
illustrated in Fig.15 for DFA-1 and R/S analysis.

If a scaling analysis method is working properly, then
the result αloc(n) from simulation with α would be a

αloc come from the average of 50 simulations. If a technique
is working, then the data for scaling exponent α should be a
weakly ﬂuctuating horizontal line centered about αloc = α.
Note that such a horizontal behavior does not hold for all the
scales. Generally, such a expected behavior begins from some
scale nmin, holds for a range and ends at a larger scale nmax.
For DFA-1, nmin is quite small α > 0.5. For R/S analysis,
nmin is small only when α ≈ 0.7.

horizontal line with slight ﬂuctuation centered about
αloc(n) = α. Note from Fig.15 that such a horizontal
behavior does not hold for all the scales n but for a cer-
tain range from nmin to nmax. In addition, at small scale,
R/S analysis gives αloc > α if α < 0.7 and αloc < α if
α > 0.7, which has been pointed out by Mandelbrot [65]
while DFA gives αloc > α if α < 1.0 and αloc < α if
α > 1.0.

It is clear that the smaller the nmin and the larger the
nmax, the better the method. We also perceive that the
expected horizontal behavior stops because the ﬂuctua-
tions become larger due to the under-sampling of F (n)
or R/S when n gets closer to the length of the signal
Nmax. Furthermore, it can be seen from Fig.15 that
1
nmax ≈
10 Nmax independent of α (if the best ﬁt region
exists), which is why one tenth of the signal length is the
maximum box size when using DFA or R/S analysis.

FIG. 16. The starting point of good ﬁt region, nmin, for
DFA-1 and R/S analysis. The results are obtained from 50
simulations, in which the length of noise is Nmax = 220. The
condition for a good ﬁt is ∆α = |αloc − α| < 0.01. The data
for α > 1.0 shown in the shading area are obtained by apply-
ing analysis on the integrations of noises with α < 1.0. It is
clear that DFA-1 works better than R/S analysis because its
nmin is always smaller than that of R/S analysis.

On the contrary, nmin does not depend on the Nmax
since αloc(n) at small n hardly changes as Nmax varies
but it does depend on α. Thus, we obtain nmin quan-
titatively as shown in Fig.16. For R/S analysis, only
for α
0.7, nmin is small; for α a little away from 0.7
(for example, 0.5), nmin becomes very large and close to
nmax, indicating that the best ﬁt region will vanish and
R/S analysis does not work at all. Comparing to R/S,
DFA works better since nmin is quite small for α > 0.5
correlated signals.

for the integrated signal would be α

One problem remains for DFA, nmin for small α (

0.5)
is still too large comparing to those for large α(> 0.5).
We can improve it by applying DFA on the integration
of the noise with α < 0.5. The resultant new expected
α
0 = α + 1, while
the nmin for the integrated signal becomes much smaller
as shown also in Fig.16(shading area α > 1). Therefore,
for a noise with α < 0.5, it is best to estimate the scaling
′
of the integrated signal ﬁrst and then obtain
exponent α
′
α by α = α
1. This is what we did in the following
sections to those anti-correlated signals.

APPENDIX B: SUPERPOSITION LAW FOR DFA

For two uncorrelated signals f (i) and g(i), their root
mean square ﬂuctuation functions are Ff (n) and Fg(n)

respectively. We want to prove that for the signal
f (i) + g(i), its rms ﬂuctuation

Ff +g(n) =

Ff (n)2 + Fg(n)2

(B1)

q

Consider three signals in the same box ﬁrst. The in-
tegrated signals for f , g and f + g are yf (i), yg(i) and
yf +g(i) and their corresponding trends are yf it
g ,yf it
f +g
(i = 1, 2, ..., n, n is the box size). Since yf +g(i) =
yf (i)+yg(i) and combine the deﬁnition of detrended ﬂuc-
tuation function Eq.3, we have that for all boxes

f , yf it

Yf +g(i) = Yf (i) + Yg(i),

(B2)

where Yf +g is the detrended ﬂuctuation function for the
signal f + g, Yf (i) is for the signal f and Yg(i) for g. Fur-
thermore, according to the deﬁnition of rms ﬂuctuation,
we can obtain

Ff +g(n)=

[Yf +g(i)]2

Nmax, for linear trends with the same slope, the DFA
must give exactly the same results for series of diﬀerent
sizes. This is not true for other trends, where the expo-
nent is 2, but the factor multiplying n2 can depend on
Nmax.

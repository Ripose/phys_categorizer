Introduction

In paper [1] the uniﬁed approach to the construction of conﬁdence in-
tervals and conﬁdence limits for a signal with a background presence, in
particular for Poisson distributions, is proposed. The method is widely used
for the presentation of physical results [2] though a number of investigators
criticize this approach [3] (in particular, this approach avoids a violation
of the coverage principle). Series of Workshops on Conﬁdence Limits has
been held in CERN and Fermilab. At these meetings demands for properties
of constructed conﬁdence intervals and conﬁdence limits have been formu-
lated [4]. On the other hand, the results of experiments often give noninteger
values of a number of observed events (for example, after ﬁtting [5]) when
Poisson distribution take place. That is why there is a necessity to search a
continuous analogue of Poisson distribution. The present work oﬀers some
generalization of Poisson distribution for continuous case. The generalization
given here allows to construct conﬁdence intervals and conﬁdence limits for
Poisson distribution parameter both for integer and real values of a number
of observed events, using conventional methods. More than, the supposi-
tion about continuous of some function f (x, λ) described below allows to use
Gamma distribution for construction of conﬁdence intervals and conﬁdence
limits of Poisson distribution parameter. In present paper we consider only
the construction of conﬁdence intervals.

In the Section 1 the generalization of Poisson distribution for the con-
tinuous case is introduced. An example of conﬁdence intervals construction
for the parameter of analogue of Poisson distribution is given in the Section
2. In the Section 3 the results of construction of conﬁdence intervals having
the minimal length for the parameter of Poisson distribution using Gamma
distribution are discussed. The main results of the paper are formulated in
the Conclusion.

1 The Generalization of Discrete Poisson Dis-

tribution for the Continuous Case

Let us have a random value ξ, taking values from the set of numbers x ∈ X.

Let us consider two-dimensional function f (x, λ) =

2

λx
x!

e−λ,

where x ≥ 0 λ > 0.

Assume, that set X includes only integer numbers, then discrete function
f (x, λ) describes distribution of probabilities for Poisson distribution with
the parameter λ and random variable x

Let us rewrite the density of Gamma distribution using unconventional

notation

f (x, a, λ) =

ax+1

Γ(x + 1)

e−aλλx, where a is a scale parameter, x > −1 is a shape

parameter and λ > 0 is a random variable. Here the quantities of x and λ
take values from the set of real numbers. Let a = 1 and as is the convention
x! = Γ(x + 1), then a continuous function

e−λ, λ > 0, x > −1 is the density of Gamma distribution with

λx
x!

f (x, λ) =
the scale parameter a = 1.

To anticipate a little, it is indicative of the Gamma distribution of pa-

rameter λ for the Poisson distribution in case of observed value x = ˆx.

Figure 1 shows the surface described by the function f (x, λ). Smooth
behaviour of this function along x and λ (see Fig.2) allows to assume that

there is such a function −1 < l(λ), that Z ∞

l(λ)

f (x, λ)dx = 1 for given value

λx
x!

distribution with the probability density f (x, λ) =

of λ. It means that in this way we introduce continued analogue of Poisson
e−λ over the area of
function deﬁnition, i.e. for x ≥ l(λ) and λ > 0. The values of the function
f (x, λ) for integer x coincide with corresponding magnitudes in the probabil-
ities distribution of discrete Poisson distribution. Dependences of the values
of function l(λ), the means and the variances for the suggested distribution
on λ were calculated by using programme DGQUAD from the library CERN-
LIB [6] and the results are presented in Table 1. This Table shows that series
of properties of Poisson distribution (Eξ = λ, Dξ = λ) take place only if the
value of the parameter λ > 3.

It is appropriate at this point to say that

f (x, λ)dx = Z ∞

2 for any integer N. Nevertheless we have to use the
if λ → ∞,
function l(λ) in our calculations in Section 2. We consider it as a mathemat-
ical trick for easy construction of conﬁdence intervals by numerically.

In principle, we can numerically to transform the function f (x, λ) in the

interval x ∈ (0, 1) so that

f (x, λ)dx = 1, Eξ = Z ∞

0

0

Z ∞
Dξ = Z ∞

0

xf (x, λ)dx = λ and

(x − Eξ)2f (x, λ)dx = λ for any λ. In this case we can construct

conﬁdence intervals without introducing of l(λ).

In Section 3 only assumption about continuous of the function f (x, λ)
along the variable x are used for construction of conﬁdence intervals of pa-
rameter λ for any observed ˆx.

Let us construct a central conﬁdence intervals for the continued analogue

of Poisson distribution using function l(λ).

2 The Construction of the Conﬁdence Inter-
vals for Continued Analogue of Poisson Dis-
tribution.

Assume that in the experiment with the ﬁxed integral luminosity the ˆx events
(ˆx is not necessity integer) of some Poisson process were observed. It means
that we have an experimental estimation ˆλ(ˆx) of the parameter λ of Poisson
distribution. We have to construct a conﬁdence interval (ˆλ1(ˆx), ˆλ2(ˆx)), cov-
ering the true value of the parameter λ of the distribution under study with
conﬁdence level 1 − α, where α is a signiﬁcance level. It is known from the
theory of statistics [8], that the value of mean of selected data is an unbi-
assed estimation of mean of distribution under study. In our case the sample
consists of one observation ˆx. For the discrete Poisson distribution the mean
coincides with the estimation of parameter value, i.e. ˆλ = ˆx. This is not
true for small value of λ in considered case (see Table 1). That is why in
order to ﬁnd the estimation of ˆλ(ˆx) for small value ˆx there is necessary to
introduce correction in accordance with Table 1. Let us construct the central
conﬁdence intervals using conventional method assuming that

Z ∞

ˆx

f (x, ˆλ1)dx =

α
2

for the lower bound ˆλ1 and

4

Z ˆx

α
2

f (x, ˆλ2)dx =

for the upper bound ˆλ2 of conﬁdence interval.

l(ˆλ2)
Figure 3 shows the introduced in the Section 1 distributions with param-
eters deﬁned by the bounds of conﬁdence interval (ˆλ1 = 1.638, ˆλ2 = 8.498)
for the case ˆx = ˆλ = 4 and the Gamma distribution with parameters a = 1,
x = ˆx = 4. The association between the conﬁdence interval and the Gamma
distribution is seen from this Figure. The bounds of conﬁdence interval with
90% conﬁdence level for parameter of continued analogue of Poisson distri-
bution for diﬀerent observed values ˆx (ﬁrst column) were calculated and are
given in second column of the Table 2.
It is necessary to notice that the
conﬁdence level of the constructed conﬁdence intervals always coincides ex-
actly with the required conﬁdence level. As it results from Table 2 that the
suggested approach allows to construct conﬁdence intervals for any real and
integer values of the observed number of events in the case of the values of
parameter λ > 3. The Table 2 shows that the left bound of central conﬁdence
intervals is not equal to zero for small ˆx. It is not suitable.

Also note that 90% of the area of Gamma distributions with parameter
x = ˆx are contained inside the constructed 90% conﬁdence intervals for ob-
served value ˆx (for small values of λ < 0.3 we have got 88%). It points out the
possibility of Gamma distribution usage for conﬁdence intervals construction
for parameter of Poisson distribution.

3 Shortest Conﬁdence Intervals for Parame-

ter of Poisson Distribution.

As is follow from formulae for f (x, λ) (see Fig.3) we may suppose that the
parameter λ of Poisson distribution for the observed value ˆx has Gamma
distribution1 with the parameters a = 1 and x = ˆx. This supposition allows
to choose conﬁdence interval of minimum length from all possible conﬁdence
intervals of given conﬁdence level without violation of the coverage principle.
The bounds of minimum length area, containing 90% of the corresponding
Gamma distribution square, were found by numerically both for integer value
of ˆx and for real value of ˆx. Here we took into account that ˆλ = ˆx, constructed
the central 90% conﬁdence interval and, then, found the shortest 90% con-

ﬁdence interval for the parameter of Poisson distribution. The results are
presented in third column of Table 2. For comparison with the results of
conventional procedure [2] of ﬁnding conﬁdence intervals, the results of cal-
culations of conﬁdence intervals for integer value of ˆx [1] are adduced in the
Table 2. By this means conﬁdence intervals, got using Gamma distribution,
may be used for real values of ˆx, even though the ˆx is negative (ˆx > −1).

Conclusion

In the paper the attempt of introducing of continued analogue of Poisson
distribution for the construction of classical conﬁdence intervals for the pa-
rameter λ of Poisson distribution is described. Two approaches (with using
of function l(λ) and with using of Gamma distribution) are considered. Con-
ﬁdence intervals for diﬀerent integer and real values of number of observed
events for Poisson process in the experiment with given integral luminosity
are constructed. As seems the approach with the use of Gamma distribution
for construction of conﬁdence intervals more preferable than approach with
using of function l(λ).

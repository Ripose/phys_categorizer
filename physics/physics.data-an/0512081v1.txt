Motivated by the dynamics of resonant neurons we discuss the properties of the ﬁrst passage
time (FPT) densities for nonmarkovian diﬀerentiable random processes. We start from an exact
expression for the FPT density in terms of an inﬁnite series of integrals over joint densities of level
crossings, and consider diﬀerent approximations based on truncation or on approximate summation
of this series. Thus, the ﬁrst few terms of the series give good approximations for the FPT density
on short times. For rapidly decaying correlations the decoupling approximations perform well in the
whole time domain.

As an example we consider resonate-and-ﬁre neurons representing stochastic underdamped or
moderately damped harmonic oscillators driven by white Gaussian or by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise.
We show, that approximations reproduce all qualitatively diﬀerent structures of the FPT densities:
from monomodal to multimodal densities with decaying peaks. The approximations work for the
systems of whatever dimension and are especially eﬀective for the processes with narrow spectral
density, exactly when markovian approximations fail.

INTRODUCTION

F

The ﬁrst passage time (FPT) is the time T when a
stochastic process x(t) leaves an a priory prescribed do-
main ∆ of its state space for the ﬁrst time, assumed that
x(t) has been started at t = 0 from a given initial value
within ∆. This concept was originally introduced by E.
Schr¨odinger when discussing behavior of Brownian par-
ticles in external ﬁelds [1]. A large variety of problems
ranging from noise in vacuum tubes, chemical reactions
and nucleation [2] to stochastic resonance [3], behavior of
neurons [4], and risk management in ﬁnance [5] can be re-
duced to FPT problems. In majority of applications the
attractor of the system’s dynamics lies inside ∆. The
escape process is characterized by the noise-induced ﬂux
through the absorbing boundary of ∆, i.e. by the prob-
ability density

(T ) of the ﬁrst passage time.

F

Approaches to ﬁnd

(T ) are typically based either on
the Fokker-Planck equation with an absorbing boundary
[6] or on the renewal theory [7]. Despite the long his-
tory, explicit expressions for the FPT density are known
only for a few cases. These include overdamped particles
under the inﬂuence of white noise in the force free case,
under time-independent constant forces and linear forces
[4, 8, 9, 10], as well as the case of a constant force un-
der colored noise [11]. Reasonable approximations exist
for a few nonlinear forces [12, 13]. The FPT densities
of stationary markovian processes have a very habitual
form:
(T ) goes through a single maximum and then
it decays either exponentially or as a power law. Many
neuronal systems do demonstrate such kind of behavior.
It was shown already in [9], that the interspike interval
(ISI) histograms obtained experimentally from output of
some neurons can be reproduced by FPT densities of one
dimensional diﬀusion process.

F

This kind of description is suitable for overdamped sys-
tems, where the relaxation time to the attractor trel is

much smaller than the typical ﬁrst passage time. At ﬁrst
the local quasiequilibrium is established in the system.
The escape occurs then from this equilibrium state and
follows with a constant rate κ inversely proportional to
the mean FPT. This situation is closely related to the
Kramer’s problem considering the quasistationary ﬂux
over transparent boundary in the low noise limit. The
problem is independent of the detailed initial state and
of the time the trajectory has spent inside ∆. At times
T exceeding trel the FPT probability density decays ex-
κT ). Well known examples
ponentially:
−
are chemical systems and nucleation processes, where the
rates determine the mean velocity of chemical reactions
or of forming overcritical nuclei [2]. Another example are
the leaky integrate-and-ﬁre and similar neuronal models,
where after the reset the corresponding trajectories ap-
proach quickly the stable rest state [14].

(T )

∼

F

However, if the time scale separation between the re-
laxation and escape does not hold, the escape can occur
before the establishment of the quasiequilibrium and the
rates are time dependent. The ﬁrst passage time depends
sensitively on the initial conditions and the FPT densi-
ties have a complex shape diﬀerent from an exponential
decay. In particular this is the case on short time scales
T < trel, which attracted growing interest because of
recent experiments studying chemical reactions on time
scales down to femtoseconds. The ﬂux over the bound-
ary before the establishment of the quasiequilibrium was
found to grow in a stepwise manner, for an underdamped
potential system staying initially at the bottom of the
well [15].

Our work is mainly motivated by dynamics of resonant
neurons [16, 17, 18]. The voltage variable of such a neu-
ron exhibits damped subthreshold oscillations around the
attractive rest state. The characteristic relaxation time
to the rest state is large compared to the mean ISI. The
escape of the voltage over the excitation threshold is the

beginning of a new spike. After spiking the voltage vari-
able is reset to a ﬁxed value far from the rest state and
then it can reach the threshold prior relaxation to the
rest. The interspike interval densities obtained from the
output of resonant neurons show a sequence of decaying
peaks separated by intervals whose length is of the order
of the period of subthreshold oscillations. In contrast to
the Kramer’s rate theory we stress again the nonstation-
ary character of this problem due to the reset to sharp
initial conditions.

The multimodal ISI probability densities can be re-
produced in models with diﬀerent mechanisms of sub-
threshold resonance:
in Hodgkin-Huxley model [19], in
excitable FitzHugh-Nagumo model with the stable ﬁx
point being a focus [20, 21] or in the region of a canard bi-
furcation [22, 23]. It was also shown that two-component
approximations might well mimic the spiking activity of
the stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley system [24, 25]. All these
models have in common that the multimodal FPT den-
sity is obtained for stochastic dynamical systems, which
have at least two dynamical variables, exhibit weakly,
moderately damped or self-amplifying oscillations and af-
ter a spike reset to initial values which are not a ﬁxed
point. In the noise-free situation these systems were de-
noted resonate-and-ﬁre neurons [26].

In the present work we aim to model excitable be-
havior with damped subthreshold oscillations. First we
present the general exact expression for the FPT den-
sity for stochastic processes with diﬀerentiable trajecto-
ries [10, 27, 28, 29].
It results in an inﬁnite series of
integrals over joint densities of multiple level crossings.
The later sum stands for a sequential summing of trajec-
tories excluding all except the ones yielding the ﬁrst pas-
sage. Furthermore, we discuss approximations for FPT
densities, which are based either on truncation of this
series, or on its approximate summation based on decou-
pling. We prove the quality of diﬀerent approximations
by explicit calculations for an underdamped harmonic
oscillator driven by white or colored Gaussian noise, rep-
resenting the stochastic resonate-and-ﬁre neurons.

II. EXACT EXPRESSION FOR THE FIRST
PASSAGE TIME DENSITY

Consider a single random variable x(t), whose t-
dependence is assumed to be diﬀerentiable. The ﬁrst
passage problem for x(t) to a boundary xb is a special
case of a level crossing problem.

The general theory of level crossings by a random pro-
cess was originally put forward by S.O. Rice [27]. He
derived an expression for the probability density of re-
currence of a stationary random process to a given level
in form of the so called Wiener-Rice series [28]. The exact
expression for the ﬁrst passage time probability density
Eq.(7) is analogous to the Wiener-Rice series and was
discussed in [29], where the main result, our Eq.(7), was
proved. We proceed by giving a much more elementary

2

derivation of Eq.(7) which serves as the main instrument
in our further investigations.

Let us ﬁrst discuss the probability n1(xb, t

x0, v0)dt
|
that a continuous diﬀerentiable process x(t) crosses the
level xb in a time interval between t and t + dt with pos-
itive velocity v(t) = ˙x(t) > 0 under initial conditions
x(0) = x0, ˙x(0) = v0. Generally the whole set of vari-
ables resulting from the markovian embedding of x(t)
should be given at t = 0. For simplicity we consider
two dimensional dynamics, generalization for the higher
dimensional systems is obvious. Crossing the level with
positive velocity will be referred to as an upcrossing in
what follows.

If x(t) crosses the barrier within time interval (t, t+dt)
with velocity v > 0, then the value of coordinate
vdt < x(t) <
at time t should lie in interval xb −
xb. The probability that x(t) is in this interval equals

P (x, v, t

x0, v0, 0)dt.

R
Now, the velocity value at the instant of crossing is pos-
itive but otherwise arbitrary. Thus we obtain the prob-
ability density of an upcrossing by integration over all
positive v:

expressions for the joint densities of upcrossings. The

probability densities according to Bayes’ theorem:

x0, v0, 0) =
P (xp, vp, tp; . . . ; xb, v1, t1|

Our aim now is to calculate the ﬁrst passage time prob-
ability density
(T ), that is the fraction of all trajectories
starting from the initial point x0 with initial velocity v0
which perform the upcrossing of the barrier at time T
and this upcrossing is the ﬁrst one. All such trajectories
are accounted for in probability density n1(T ) (see the
ﬁrst row in Fig. 1). However, n1(T ) also accounts for
trajectories for which the upcrossing at time T was not
the ﬁrst one, i.e. which had another upcrossing at some
earlier time t1 < T (row 2 in Fig. 1). Such trajectories

This excludes all trajectories which cross xb exactly twice

since the trajectories crossing xb three times, i.e at time
T and at two earlier moments ti < T, i = 1, 2 (row 3
in Fig. 1), are not accounted for correctly. Each such
trajectory is counted once in n1(T ). The second term
in Eq.(4) accounts for the pairs of upcrossings at T and
at some ti < T . Each trajectory with two additional
upcrossings at ti < T, i = 1, 2 is therefore subtracted
T
twice in
0 n2(T, t1)dt1. Such trajectories should not
contribute to
(T ): in Eq. (4) we subtracted too much

and have to add the amount of trajectories with three
upcrossings at times 0 < ti < T, i = 1, 2 and T again:

Eq.(6) connects

the solution of the FPT
problem with absorbing boundary at xb, with all joint

(T ), i.e.

densities of upcrossings for the unbounded process. To
obtain np(tp, . . . , t1) we consider trajectories, which are
not absorbed at xb, but can return after an upcrossing
and then cross xb again and again. The right combination
of all these densities of multiple level crossings results in
the probability density for the ﬁrst upcrossing.

An alternative to direct summation of inﬁnite series
Eq.(6) is based on an analogue to a cumulant expan-
sion. The times, when the random process x(t) performs
upcrossings of xb form a point process, or a system of
random points [7, 10]. The functions

n1(t1),

n2(t2, t1),

n3(t3, t2, t1),

. . .

(8)

are the distribution functions of the point process. Since
x(t) has ﬁnite velocity, the interval between two upcross-
ings can not be arbitrary small and so np(tp, . . . , t1) van-
ishes if two of its arguments coincide. Such random point
process is called a system of nonapproaching points [10].
In this context
(T ) is interpreted as the waiting-time
density of the point process. The last is the probability
density for the time T when the ﬁrst event occur.

ized by its cumulant functions

Choose an arbitrary natural number r, and then ﬁx r ar-

Eqs.(9)-(12) are general expressions which hold for sys-
tems of random points, deﬁned by distribution functions
Eq.(8) of any kind. So are also Eqs.(6) and (13), (14),
which give the waiting-time density for arbitrary point
process. In particular, for the random points being the
times, when a diﬀerentiable random process crosses the
level xb, the distribution functions np(tp, . . . , t1) are given
by the joint densities of upcrossings Eq.(2). Then Eqs.(6)
and (13), (14) together with Eq.(2) express the ﬁrst pas-
sage time density for this diﬀerentiable random process.
The function S′(T ) can be interpreted as a the time-
dependent escape rate.

These are the exact results for the FPT probability
density of any continuous diﬀerentiable random process.
Though these results were employed for mathematical
proofs, up to our knowledge these inﬁnite series of mul-
tiple integrals was never used for explicit calculations.
We proceed to show, that Eqs.(6) and (13), (14) can be
a starting point for several approximations. As often in
the case of inﬁnite series, the useful approximations can
be based either on the truncation of the series after sev-
eral ﬁrst terms calculated exactly, or by approximation
of the higher order terms through the lower order ones
what might lead to a closed analytical form. Truncation
approximations for Eq.(6) are not normalized, hold only
on short time scales, and diverge at longer times (due
to the miscount of trajectories with several upcrossings).
The approximations of the second type are based on a
subsummation in Eq.(14) for S(T ). They are normalized
and can be used in the whole time domain. Note, only
approximations guaranteeing positive rates S′(T ) are rea-
sonable. Thus the set of possible approximations for the
series Eq.(14) is rather restricted.

form:

The model we have in mind is the resonate-and-ﬁre
model of a neuron [26]. This is the least complicated
model accounting for the resonant properties of neurons
in terms of an equivalent RLC circuit [16, 17]. In this
way it is directly related to the leaky integrate-and-ﬁre
model also based on the electrical analogy. Alternatively
the model can be interpreted as a systematic and lin-
earized reduction of Hodgkin-Huxley type dynamics [30].
For the sake of simplicity we neglect the absolute refrac-
tory time. Under this assumption the model is equiv-
alent to the underdamped harmonic oscillator with the
threshold and reset, what makes the results applicable in
many other domains of science. We change by time scale
and variable transformations to dimensionless parame-
ters and variables. The dynamics of the voltage variable

In the present paper we
consider two types of noisy drive: (i) the white noise

Let us consider truncation approximations for the se-
ries Eq.(6). The ﬁrst approximation is given by the
ﬁrst term n1(T ), the second approximation by 2 terms,
Eq.(4), and the third by 3 terms, Eq.(5). The higher
order approximations entail the numerical estimation of
highdimensional integrals, which at some stage leads to a
computational eﬀort larger than the one necessary for a
direct simulation. Therefore we restrict ourselves to the
1-, 2- and 3- terms approximations.

tributed over the long exponential tail in the real FPT
density, is concentrated in the positive artefact posed on
intermediate times in the normalized truncations. Hence
the mean FPT computed from such approximations is
always strongly underestimated.

The more terms are included, the more precise trun-
cations become. However one has to conﬁne oneself to
a few terms, since the calculation of higher order terms
implies the computation of multiple integrals and is not
more eﬀective than simulations. Therefore the trunca-
tion approximations are good, when the most part of the
FPT probability is concentrated in the ﬁrst few peaks,
i.e. when the barrier value is low or the noise is strong.

V. DECOUPLING APPROXIMATIONS

Decoupling approximations for Eq.(6) or Eq.(14) are
based on approximate expressions of the higher order
terms through the lower order ones, what may lead to
a closed analytical form. Thereby inﬁnitely many ap-
proximate terms are included.

The simplest way to obtain such an approximation is to
neglect all correlations between upcrossings. This means
to neglect all terms in Eq.(14) except for the ﬁrst one,
and leads to

S(T ) =

n1(t)dt.

the Hertz approximation since the form of

of ﬁrst order, since it takes the ﬁrst term of the series
exactly, and all other terms are approximated through
this ﬁrst one.

The second order approximation should therefore ac-
count the ﬁrst and the second terms exactly and approx-
imate all higher terms through these two. The general
form of
(T ) in terms of the cumulant functions Eq.(13)
ensures the right normalization, irrespective of the way
how S(T ) is approximated. However the simple trunca-
tion of the series Eq.(14) after the second term does not
ensure the positive escape rate S′(T ).

The second order approximation guaranteeing S′(T ) >
0 was proposed by Stratonovich in the context of peak du-
ration [10]. The ﬁrst and the second cumulant functions
are taken exactly, and the higher ones are approximated
by the combinations of these two:

Let us now discuss the domains of applicability for
these approximations. The Hertz approximation Eq.(20)

correlations is described by the relaxation time trel = 2/γ
of the process. Therefore, the Hertz approximation holds

Eq.(23) is exact for all arguments coinciding. Eq.(21)

FIG. 6: Same as in Fig. 5 however for the case of stronger
friction. The parameters are a) γ = 3.0, D = 0.5, ω0/γ = 0.33,
b) γ = 10.0, D = 5.5, ω0/γ = 0.1 and other parameters as in
Fig. 5.

Let us now turn to the results for the harmonic oscil-
lator Eq.(15) with white noise driving. In Figs.5 and 6

the FPT probability density obtained from simulations
is depicted with a gray line, the Hertz approximation
Eq.(20) with a black dashed line, and the Stratonovich
approximation Eq.(24) with a black solid line.

In Fig.5(a) the parameters are chosen to be γ =
0.8, D = 0.1, corresponding to moderate friction and
moderate noise intensity. For given parameter values
TR, both
trel = 2.5 and TR = 343, so that trel ≪
Hertz and Stratonovich approximations hold and repro-
duce well the FPT density in the whole time domain.

In the case of moderate friction and stronger noise
the upcrossings become more frequent and TR decreases.
The FPT changes its form to practically monomodal. An
example is given in Fig.5(b) with γ = 0.8, D = 0.44
which correspond to trel = 2.5 and TR = 15.6. The
Stratonovich approximation complies very well with sim-
ulations, while the Hertz approximation fails to repro-
duce the details of the distribution: It underestimates
(T ) on short times, and shows slower exponential de-
F
cay in the tail than the one observed in simulations (see
the inset).

Finally, for small friction and week noise the upcross-
ings are rare, but the relaxation time is large. The FPT
probability density exhibits multiple decaying peaks. In
Fig.5(c) γ = 0.08, D = 0.01 corresponding to trel =
25, TR = 343. Again, the Stratonovich approximation
performs well, while the Hertz approximation underesti-
mates the ﬁrst peak, overestimates all further peaks and
decays in the tail faster than the simulated FPT density.

In the overdamped regime (γ > 2ω0) the condition

region of our approximations is limited. With increas-
ing friction the process x(t) approaches to the markovian

one (it is markovian in the overdamped limit ω0/γ
For such processes the pattern of upcrossings is not
homogeneous, but shows rather well separated clusters
of upcrossings [10]. Essentially in the markovian limit
the property, that upcrossings form a system of non-
approaching random points is violated. The upcross-

≪

9

ings within a single cluster are not independent even
if their mean density n0 is low, so that the quality of
approximations decreases. This fact is illustrated in
Fig.6.
In the overdamped regime the correlation func-
tions decay monotonously, and the FPT densities are
always monomodal. The parameters in Fig.6(a) are
γ = 3.0, D = 5.5, so that ω0/γ = 0.33. Eqs.(13),(24)
continue to give a good approximation for
(T ), while
the Hertz approximation becomes inaccurate. Further
increase in friction, for example γ = 10.0, D = 5.5 as in
Fig.6(b) corresponding to ω0/γ = 0.1, makes the pro-
cess to approach the Markovian limit. The Stratonovich
approximation starts to be inaccurate, and the Hertz ap-
proximation fails.

VI. TRUNCATION VERSUS DECOUPLING
APPROXIMATIONS.

In the two previous sections we have seen, that trunca-
tion approximations reproduce the FPT density on short
time scales. In contrast, the decoupling approximations
reproduce FPT densities in the whole time domain and
posses the right normalization. At the ﬁrst glance, it
may seem that the decoupling approximations excel the
direct truncations and should be preferably used in ap-
plications. However, it depends on the problem one has
to solve, and sometimes the truncations turn out to be
useful.

Gaussian noise, ω0 = 1, γ = 0.08, D = 0.01, x0 = −1, v0 =
0, xb = 1. Simulation results are shown with crosses, the 3
terms approximation with black line, and the Stratonovich
approximation with gray line. The inset shows the magniﬁ-
cation of a part of the curve.

One such situation was already mentioned. If the noise
intensity is high or the barrier value is low, then the up-
crossings occur frequently, and the decoupling approxi-
mations can not be applied. For example, for parameter
values as in Fig.2, the relaxation time is trel = 200, and
the mean interval between upcrossings TR = 8.07. Thus

trel > TR, and both Hertz and Stratonovich approxima-
tions fail. Nevertheless, the most part of the FPT density
is concentrated in the ﬁrst few peaks in this case, and
is well reproduced by the truncation approximations, as
shown in Figs.2 and 4.

One can also be interested in a very accurate approx-
imation for the FPT density on short times. The trun-
cations deliver better results on short times than the de-
coupling approximations. For example, in Fig.7 the sim-
ulation results are compared with the 3 terms truncation
and the Stratonovich approximation for the same param-
eter values as in Fig.5(c). Both approximation reproduce
very accurate the ﬁrst peak in the FPT density. How-
ever, the 3 terms truncation is much more accurate in
estimation of the second and third peaks (see the inset
in Fig.7).

This can be easily understood. The Stratonovich
approximation takes n1(t1) and n2(t2, t1) exactly, and
approximates all higher order densities through these
two. On times, when the ﬁrst peak occurs, n2(t2, t1)
is negligibly small. Then from Eqs.(21),(22) we ob-
tain gp(tp, . . . , t1)
1)!n1(tp) . . . n1(t1).
Substitution of this expression into Eq.(10) gives then
np(tp, . . . , t1)
0 for p > 1. Thus on these times the
Stratonovich approximation just coincides with the 1
term truncation, and so reproduces the ﬁrst peak very
accurately. On times, when the second peak in the FPT
density occurs, n2(t2, t1) is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from
zero. Hence all approximated np(tp, . . . , t1), p > 2 turn
out to be nonvanishing as well, while the real values
for these functions are negligibly small on these times.
Thus the accuracy of the Stratonovich approximation de-
creases in the second peak. From analogous reasoning it
becomes clear, that the Hertz approximation is already
inaccurate in estimation of the ﬁrst peak.

VII. HARMONIC OSCILLATOR DRIVEN BY
COLORED NOISE

Expressions Eq.(6) and Eqs.(13),(24) can be used to
obtain the FPT density for a random process x(t), if the
joint probability densities of x and its velocity v Eq.(2)
exist. Thus it is necessary that the process x(t) is con-
tinuous and diﬀerentiable at any time, but there are no
further restrictions on dimension and form of the system.
The truncation and decoupling approximations deliver
good results for the FPT density in their validity regions
independently of the character of the noisy drive. In par-
ticular the case of correlated input signals (colored noise
driving) is of importance in neuroscience. For example,
synaptic ﬁltering of the input spike train may lead to an
exponentially correlated input signal.

Therefore we consider as another example a resonate-
and-ﬁre neuron Eq.(15) driven by the Ornstein-
Uhlenbeck noise. The correlation time of the process
is τ , the variance D/τ , and the correlation function

Then n1(T ) is again obtained analytically and has the
form given by Eq.(17). Now µij = µji are elements of the
inverse correlation matrix ( ˆC5)−1, qi are components of
vector ~Q = (x(T ), v(T ), x0(0), v0(0), η0(0)). The factor α
is deﬁned in the same way as it was done in Section III.
For simplicity, we assumed sharp initial conditions for
the noise variable, i.e. η is reset after every spike to
a ﬁxed value η0. The alternative assumption, that the
neuron variables x, v are reset to their initial values once
x(t) reaches the thereshold without resetting η(t), might
be more realistic [11].
In this case all probability den-
sities should be averaged with respect to the stationary
density of noise values upon ﬁring. However, as an exam-
ple, we conﬁne ourselves to consideration of sharp initial
conditions for the noise: P (η, t = 0) = δ(η

η0).

VIII. SUMMARY

Motivated by studies of resonant neurons, we consider
the ﬁrst passage time problem for systems with sub-
threshold oscillations and nonnegligible relaxation times
after a reset. The joint densities of multiple upcrossings
for such a process x(t) can be obtained in the case of dif-
ferentiable trajectories. The FPT density for x(t) is ex-
pressed in terms of an inﬁnite series of multiple integrals
over all joint densities of upcrossings, or equivalently, in
terms of the cumulant functions.

We consider two types of approximations for this in-
ﬁnite series. The truncation approximations include the
ﬁrst few terms of the series calculated exactly. They re-
produce well the FPT density on short and intermidi-
ate times and can be used, when the most part of the
FPT probability is concentrated in the ﬁrst few peaks,
i.e. when the barrier value is low or the noise is strong.
The decoupling approximations can be derived for the
case of weakly correlated upcrossings. The higher order
cumulant functions are expressed through the lower or-
der ones, and then inﬁnitely many terms sum up to the
closed expression for
(T ). The Hertz approximation
(the one neglecting all correlations between upcrossings)
is absolutely suﬃcient for the case of moderate friction
and moderate noise intensity. The Stratonovich approx-
imation (approximating the higher order cumulant func-

F

tions through the ﬁrst and the second ones) performs
even better and does not loose the accuracy for high noise
intensities or in the slightly overdamped regime.

We illustrate our results by the noise driven harmonic
oscillator, with the threshold value at xb and reset to
sharp initial conditions, i.e. the resonate-and-ﬁre model
of a neuron. The validity regions of the approxima-
tions cover all diﬀerent types of subthreshold dynamics.
Thus the approximations reproduce all qualitatively dif-
ferent structures of the FPT densities: from monomodal
through bimodal to multimodal densities with several de-
caying peaks. The approximations hold for systems of
whatever dimension. We illustrate this by the harmonic
oscillator driven by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise.

Though we applied the theory to the harmonic oscilla-
tor (resonate-and-ﬁre model), the linearity of the system
is in general not required. The joint distributions of x(t)
and its velocity should exist, i.e. x(t) should be diﬀeren-
tiable in time. No further restrictions on the form and
dimension of the system are implied.

We propose a useful approach to investigate statistical properties of foreign currency exchange
rates. Our approach is based on queueing theory, especially, the so-called renewal-reward theorem.
For ﬁrst passage processes of the Sony bank USD/JPY exchange rate, we evaluate the average
waiting time which is deﬁned as the average time for customers to wait until the next rate change
from any time point when they want to check the rate, for example, when they login to their
computer systems. We ﬁnd that the assumption of exponential distribution on the ﬁrst passage
process should be rejected and a Weibull distribution seems to be more suitable to explain the
stochastic process of the Sony bank rate. Our approach also enables us to evaluate the expected
reward for customers, namely, one can predict how long customers wait and how much reward they
obtain by the next price change after they login to the computer systems. We check the validity by
comparing our prediction with empirical data analysis.

INTRODUCTION

Recently, internet trading has become very popular. Obviously, the rate (or price) change of the trading behaves
according to some unknown stochastic processes and lots of studies have been done to reveal the statistical properties
of its non-linear dynamics [1, 2, 3]. In fact, several authors analyzed tick-by-tick data of the price change including
the currency exchange rate in ﬁnancial markets [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Among these stochastic processes of the price
change in ﬁnancial markets, the USD/JPY (US Dollar/Japanese Yen) exchange rate of the Sony bank [12], which
is an internet-based bank, reproduces their rate by using some rate window with width 0.1 yen for their individual
customers in Japan. That is, if the USD/JPY market rate changes by more than 0.1 yen, the Sony bank rate for
USD/JPY is updated to the market rates. In this sense, it is possible for us to say that the procedure of determination
of the USD/JPY exchange rate of the Sony bank is essentially the ﬁrst passage process [4, 5].

In this paper, we analyze the average time interval for a customer to wait until the next price (rate) change after
they login to their computer systems. Empirical data analysis has shown that the average time interval between
rate changes is one of the important statistics to understand market behavior. However, as internet tradings become
popular, the customers would be more interested in the average waiting time, which is deﬁned as the average time
for customers to wait until the next rate change from any time point when they want to check the rate, for example,
when they login to their computer systems, rather than the average time interval between the rate changes. In order
to evaluate the average waiting time, we use the so-called renewal-reward theorem which is well-known in the ﬁeld of
queueing theory [13, 14]. Moreover, we give a simple formulation to evaluate the expected reward for the customers.
Especially, we investigate these important quantities for the Sony bank USD/JPY exchange rate by analysis for
a simple probabilistic model and computer simulations which are based on the ARCH (autoregressive conditional
heteroscedasticity) [15] and the GARCH (generalized ARCH) [1, 16, 17] stochastic models with the assistance of the
empirical data analysis of the Sony bank rate [10, 11].

This paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we explain the mechanism of the Sony bank and introduce
several studies concerning with empirical data of the rate. In Sec. III, we introduce a general formulation to evaluate
the average waiting time by renewal-reward theorem and calculate it for the customers of the Sony bank. Recently,
one of the authors [11] gave some evidences which imply that the FPT distribution of the Sony bank rate obeys the
so-called Weibull distribution [18]. This conjecture is regarded as a counter part of studies which suggest that the FPT
should follow an exponential distribution (see e.g. [19]). In the same section, we evaluate the average waiting time

by means of the assumption that the FPT obeys an exponential distribution. Then, we compare it with the result
for the Weibull distribution and some empirical data analysis [10, 11]. We ﬁnd that the assumption of exponential
distributions on the ﬁrst passage process should be rejected and a Weibull distribution seems to be more suitable to
explain the ﬁrst passage processes of the Sony bank rate. Thus, we can predict how long customers wait and how
much returns they obtain until the next rate change after they login to the computer systems. In Sec. IV, in order
to investigate the eﬀect of the rate window of the Sony bank, we introduce the ARCH and the GARCH models to
reproduce the raw data before ﬁltering through the rate window. In Sec. V, we evaluate the expected reward for the
customer to be expected to obtain after they login to their computer systems. Last section is summary.

II. THE SONY BANK USD/JPY EXCHANGE RATE

The Sony bank rate [12] is the foreign exchange rate that the Sony bank oﬀers with reference to the market rate,
not their customers’ orders. In FIG. 1, we show a typical update of the Sony bank rate. If the USD/JPY market rate

changes by more than 0.1 yen, in other words, if the market rate changes by greater or equal to 0.1 yen, the Sony
bank USD/JPY rate is updated to their market rate. In this sense, the Sony bank rate can be regarded as a kind of
ﬁrst passage processes. In TABLE I, we show several data concerning the Sony bank USD/JPY rate vs. tick-by-tick
data by Bloomberg for USD/JPY rate.

III. RENEWAL-REWARD THEOREM AND AVERAGE WAITING TIME

From TABLE I, we ﬁnd that the number of data a day is remarkably reduced from

70 because of
the eﬀect of the rate window with width 0.1 yen. As the result, the average interval of the update of the exchange
rates is extended to
20 minutes. This quantity is one of the most important measures for the market, however,
customers might seek for some information about the average waiting time, which is deﬁned as the average time

10, 000 to

interval for the customers to wait until the next change of the Sony bank USD/JPY rate after they login to their own
computer systems. In order to evaluate the average waiting time, we use what we call renewal-reward theorem which
is well-known in the ﬁeld of queueing theory [13, 14]. We ﬁrst explain the theorem brieﬂy below.

Let us deﬁne N (τ ) as the number of rate changes within the interval (0, τ ] and suppose that a customer logins to

her or his own computer system at time τ (τN (τ ) ≤

τ < τN (τ )+1). Then, we deﬁned the following quantity

W (τ ) = τN (τ ) −
which means the waiting time for the customer by the next update of the Sony bank USD/JPY rates when she or he
logins to the computer system at time τ . Then, the renewal-reward theorem [13, 14] implies that the average waiting
time w is written in terms of the ﬁrst two moments E(t) and E(t2) of the ﬁrst passage time distribution P (t) as

Thus, equation (2) holds. (cid:3)

Therefore, if we obtain the explicit form of the ﬁrst passage time distribution P (t), the average waiting time w is
evaluated by the theorem (2). However, what we can do for estimation of the distribution P (t) is just only empirical
data analysis of the Sony bank rate. Apparently, the ﬁrst passage process of the Sony bank rate depends on the
stochastic process of raw data of the market behind the data which is available on the web site for the customers
after being ﬁltered by the rate window with width 0.1 yen. However, unfortunately, the raw data is not available for
us and we can not use any information about the high-frequency raw data.

Recently, several empirical data analysis by one of the present authors [11] revealed that the Weibull distribution

which is deﬁned by

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

is a good approximation of the Sony bank USD/JPY rate in non-asymptotic regime. We should keep in mind that in
the asymptotic regime, the FPT distribution obeys a power-law as P (t)
3.67) and a phase transition takes
18, 000 [s]. However, the number of empirical data for the power-law regime
place at the intermediate time scale tc ∼
is only 0.3%. Similar behavior was pointed out for the time interval distribution between two consecutive transactions
of BUND futures (BUND is the German word for bond) traded at LIFFE (London International Financial Futures
Exchange) and the time interval distribution changes from the stretched exponential to the power-law for long-time
regime by using the Mittag-Leﬄer type function [20]. Therefore, we choose here the Weibull distribution in both
asymptotic and non-asymptotic regimes to evaluate the average waiting time. The justiﬁcation for this choice will be
discussed later by comparing the predicted value with the result from empirical data analysis.

This Weibull distribution (6) is reduced to the exponential distribution for m = 1 and the Rayleigh distribution for
m = 2. It is easy for us to evaluate the ﬁrst two moments of the distribution PW (t). We obtained them explicitly
as E(t) = a1/mΓ(1 + (1/m)) and E(t2) = a2/mΓ(1 + (2/m)). Thus, the average waiting time w for the Weibull
distribution is explicitly given by

a = 50.855 which was evaluated from empirical data of the Sony bank USD/JPY rate [11]. From the inset, for the parameter m = 0.59,
the average waiting time w is expected to be w ≃ 2534.146 [s] = 42.236 [min]. This time interval is not so far from the result w ∼ 49 [min]
from our empirical data analysis.

(7) as a function of m for several values of a. From this ﬁgure, we ﬁnd that the average waiting time w for customers
of the Sony bank is convenient and reasonable. This is because the empirical data analysis reported the values of the
parameters as m = 0.59 and the average waiting time w for this case is evaluated as w
2534.146 [s] = 42.236 [min]
from the inset of this ﬁgure. From the reference [11], we do not have any information about the scaling parameter a,
however, we can easily obtain the value as follows.

As we mentioned, several results from empirical data analysis [11] revealed that the parameter m is m
the Sony bank rate. Actually, it is possible for us to estimate a by using the fact that the average interval
rate change is

Substituting m

It should be noted that the average waiting time is also evaluated by a simple sampling from the empirical data
of the Sony bank rates. From the sampling, the ﬁrst two moments of the ﬁrst passage time distribution PW (t) :

49 [min] which is not so far from the evaluation
w = 42.236 [min] by means of the renewal-reward theorem. Thus, the renewal-reward theorem we introduced here
determines the average waiting time of the ﬁnancial system well, and our assumption of the Weibull distribution for
the ﬁrst passage time of the Sony bank rates seems to be reasonable. Especially, we would like to stress that the 0.3%
data from the asymptotic regime does not contribute so much to the average waiting time.

The detail account of this ﬁne agreement between w and wsampling, more precisely, what is a factor for the small

diﬀerence between them, will be reported in our forthcoming paper [21].

In last part of this section, we would like to mention about the average waiting time for the case in which the
ﬁrst passage process can be regarded as a Poisson process. In the Poisson process, the number of events occurring
in the interval (0, τ ] is given by Pk(τ ) = (λτ )k e−λτ /k! (k = 0, 1, 2,
). For this Poisson process, the time interval t
between arbitrary two successive events obeys the following exponential distribution :

· · ·

P (t) = λ e−λt.

Then, we have the ﬁrst two moments of the above distribution P (t) as E(t) = 1/λ, E(t2) = 2/λ2. These two moments
gives the average waiting time for the Poisson process as w = E(t2)/2E(t) = 1/λ = E(t). Therefore, for the Poisson
process, the average waiting time w is identical to the average rate interval E(t). This result might be naturally
accepted because the login-time dependence on the average waiting time is averaged out due to the fact that for a
Poisson process, each event takes place independently. On the other hand, for a non-Poisson process, the login-time
is essential to determine the average waiting time. Thus, the average waiting time becomes E(t2)/2E(t) instead of
E(t).

We should stress that for a given stochastic process, whose FPT is constant T , the average waiting time w is easily
T
0 sds = T /2. However, the result for the above Poisson process implies that for a Poisson
evaluated by w = (1/T )
process with a mean E(t) of the FPT, the average waiting time is not E(t)/2 but E(t). This fact is referred to as
R
inspection paradox [13] in the ﬁeld of queueing theory. For a Poisson process, each event occurs independently but
the time interval between the events follows a exponential distribution. Therefore, there are some chances for the
customers to login to the computer systems when the exchange rate remains the value for relatively long time although
the short FPT occurs with higher frequency than the long FPT. This fact makes w as the ﬁrst moment E(t) if the
FPT distribution.

On the other hand, for the Weibull distribution, the condition on which the average waiting time w is the same as

the average ﬁrst passage time E(t) is given by w = E(t), that is,

by the renewal-reward theorem becomes longer than the average ﬁrst passage time E(t). As we already mentioned,

in the case of the Poisson process, the login time dependence of the customers is averaged out in the calculation of the
average waiting time w. As the result, w becomes the ﬁrst moment of the FPT distribution, namely, E(t). However,
once the parameter of the Weibull distribution is deviated from m = m× = 1, the cumulative distribution is no longer
exponential distribution. Thus, the stochastic process is not described by a Poisson process and the average waiting
time w is not E(t) but w = E(t2)/2E(t) which is derived from the renewal-reward theorem. As we already mentioned,

IV. EFFECT OF RATE WINDOW ON FIRST PASSAGE PROCESSES OF PRICE CHANGE

In the previous sections, we evaluated the average waiting time w for foreign exchange rates (price change). Espe-
cially, we focused on the averaged waiting time of the Sony bank rate whose FPT distribution might be followed by
a Weibull distribution. We compared the average waiting time w obtained by the renewal-reward theorem with that
obtained by a simple sampling of the empirical data of the Sony bank rate. We found a good agreement in those two.
However, as we mentioned, the empirical data of the Sony bank was obtained by ﬁltering more frequently raw data
of the market by using the rate window with width 0.1 yen. Unfortunately, the raw data of the real market is not
available for us and only information we could have is the Sony bank rate itself. Therefore, it is worth while for us to
investigate the role of the rate window with the assistance of computer simulations.

For this purpose, we introduce the stochastic process Xk0, Xk1 ,
kn−1,
k0, t2 = k2 −

time stamps t1 = k1 −
parameters m0 and a0. For example, the above stochastic process is described by

for the ordinary Wiener process. Obviously, the ﬁrst passage time of the above stochastic process has a distribution
P (t) which is, in general, diﬀerent from the P 0
W (∆t). Nevertheless, here we assume that the P (t) also obeys a Weibull
distribution with parameters m and a. Then, we investigate the eﬀect of the rate window with width ǫ through the
diﬀerence of the parameters, namely, the m-m0 and a-a0 plots. For simplicity, we set a = a0 = 1 in our computer
simulations. In other words, we make clear the relation between the input m0 and the corresponding output m of the
ﬁlter with rate window with width ǫ by computer simulations.

A. The Weibull paper analysis of the FPT distribution

In order to determine the output m from the histogram of the ﬁrst passage time, we use the Weibull paper analysis

[11, 18] for the cumulative distribution. In following, we brieﬂy explain the detail of the method.

We consider the cumulative distribution of the Weibull distributions with a = 1, namely,

R(t) =

PW (s)ds = exp(

tm).

Then, for the cumulative distribution as a histogram obtained by sampling via computer simulations, we ﬁt the
histogram to the Weibull distribution by using the following Weibull paper :

(15)
Thus, the parameter m of the ﬁrst passage time distribution P (t) is obtained as a slope of the log t-log log(R(t)−1)
plot. In following, we evaluate the parameter m of the FPT distribution for the stochastic processes with time intervals
of two successive time stamps ∆t obeying the Weibull distribution P 0
W (∆t). Then, we compare m0 with m by using
the above Weibull paper analysis (15).

B. ARCH and GARCH processes as stochastic models for raw data of the market

As an stochastic model of the raw data of the real market, the Wiener process we deﬁned by equations (12)(13) is
one of the simplest candidates. However, a lot of studies from both empirical and theoretical view points have revealed

7

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

that the volatility of the ﬁnancial data like a USD/JPY exchange rate is a time dependent stochastic variable. With
this fact in mind, we introduce two types of the stochastic processes which are characterized by time dependent
volatility, that is, ARCH (autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity) [15] and GARCH (generalized ARCH) models
[1, 15, 17].

The ARCH(1) model we will deal with here is described as follows.

where we assumed that the time interval ∆t obeys the Weibull distribution (13). From the deﬁnition (16)(17), we
ﬁnd that the volatility σ2
t controlling the conditional probability density P (Xt) at time t is ﬂuctuated. However, in
, such a local time dependence does not prevent the stochastic process from having a well-deﬁned
the limit of t
asymptotic distribution P (X). In fact, the above ARCH(1) model is characterized by the variance σ2 observed on a
long time interval t

. It is easily shown that σ2 is written in terms of α0 and α1 as

→ ∞

→ ∞

As the parameters α0 and α1, we choose them so as to satisfy σ = ǫ = 1. As a possible choice for this requirement,
we select (α0, α1) = (0.45, 0.55). For this parameter choice, the kurtosis : Kurt, which is deﬁned by the second and
the fourth moments of the probability distribution function of the stochastic variable X as

As well-known, ﬁnancial data with higher kurtosis values indicates that the values close to the mean and extreme
positive and negative outliers appear more frequently than for normally distributed variables. In other words, the
kurtosis is a measure of the fatness of the tails of the distribution. For instance, a normal Gaussian distribution has
Kurt = 0, whereas, the distributions with Kurt > 0 are referred to as leptokurtic and have tails fatter than a Gaussian.
The kurtosis of the ARCH(1) model with (α0, α1) = (0.45, 0.55) is Kurt = 23.

We also introduce here the GARCH(1,1) model deﬁned by

parameter m0 of the Weibull distribution, whereas, above this line, the parameter m0 increases to m(> m0). As we
mentioned, empirical data analysis of the Sony bank rate [11] suggested that the waiting time or the time interval ∆t

data before taking the rate window could be modeled by the GARCH(1,1) model. The right panel of FIG. 5 shows
the m0-dependence of the average waiting time obtained by the data after the rate window ﬁlter is aﬀected. From
this panel, we ﬁnd that the GARCH(1,1) model reproduces the average waiting time w for the raw data (Weibull :
exact) more eﬀectively than the other three models do.

V. EVALUATION OF EXPECTED REWARDS

In the previous sections, we consider the average waiting time for the customers to wait until the next update of
the Sony bank rate after she or he logins to her or his own computer systems. To evaluate the average waiting time,
we used the renewal-reward theorem which is well-known in the ﬁeld of queueing theory [13, 14]. Besides the average
waiting time, we have another relevant quantity when we seek for investigating the statistical properties of the Sony
bank rate from the diﬀerent view point. For instance, the cumulative return for the customers to be expected to

is one of these candidates for such relevant quantities. In the deﬁnition of the cumulative return (24), N (t) means
the number of rate changes within time interval t. The return Yn is the diﬀerence between the rates of two successive
time stamps n + 1 and n. Then, the long time average of the cumulative return deﬁned by R
limt→∞(R(t)/t) is
rewritten as

Obviously, if the distribution of the diﬀerence of the rates Y between arbitrary two successive time stamps obeys
symmetric distribution around Y = 0, µ becomes zero, and as the result, the reward rate R also becomes zero. In
order to carry out theoretical evaluations for the R, namely, to investigate the skewness S-dependence of the reward
rate R, we assume that the stochastic variable Y obeys the following skew-normal distribution in which the regions

FIG. 7: The reward rate R as a function of the skewness S of the skew-normal distribution. We set the parameters m and a for the

rate increases dramatically as the skewness of the skew-normal distribution (29) becomes positive. As the skewness
increases, the reward rate R is saturated to the value 0.0003 [yen/s] for our model system in which the time interval of
the rate change t obeys the Weibull distribution with (m, a) = (0.59, 50.855) and the diﬀerence of the rate Y follows
the skew-normal distribution (29). In this ﬁgure, we also ﬁnd that if we increase the width ǫ of the rate window from
ǫ = 0.1 to ǫ = 1, the reward R rate decreases. For companies or internet banks, this kind of information might be
useful because they can control the reward rate (this takes both positive and negative value) for their customers by
tuning the width ǫ of the rate window in their computer simulations.

11

Moreover, we should notice that we can also evaluate the expected reward R = Rw which is a return for the
customers to be expected to encounter after she of he login to their own computer systems. By combining the result
60 = 2534.146 [s], we conclude
obtained in this section R = 0.0003 [yen/s] and the average waiting time w = 42.236
that the expected reward should be smaller than R = Rw
0.76 [yen]. This result seems to be important and useful
∼
for both the customers and the bank. Of course, the probabilistic model dealt with here for P (t) or P (Y ) is just a
candidate to explain the stochastic process of the real or the empirical rate change. Therefore, several modiﬁcations
are needed to carry out much deeper investigation from theoretical point of view. Nevertheless, our formulation might
have a remarkable usefulness to deal with the price changes in real ﬁnancial markets.

VI. SUMMARY

In this paper, we introduced a concept of queueing theory to analysis of price change in a ﬁnancial market. As the
price change, we focus on the USD/JPY exchange rate of the Sony bank, which is an internet-based bank. By using
the renewal-reward theorem and on the assumption that the Sony bank rate is described by a ﬁrst passage process
whose FPT distribution follows a Weibull distribution, we evaluated the average waiting time for the customers of
the Sony bank to wait until the next rate change after they login to their own computer systems. The theoretical
prediction and the result from the empirical data analysis are in a good agreement on the value of the average waiting
time. Moreover, our analysis revealed that if we assume that the Sony bank rate is described by a Poisson arrival
process with exponential FPT distribution, the average waiting time predicted by the renewal-reward theorem is a
half of the result by the empirical data analysis. This result provides a justiﬁcation for non-exponential time intervals
of the Sony bank USD/JPY exchange rate. We also evaluated the expected reward for the customer to be expected to
encounter by the next price change after they login to their own computer systems. We assumed that the distribution
of return follows a skew-normal distribution and the FPT follows a Weibull distribution and found that the expected
0.76 yen. This kind of information about statistical
return for the customers of the Sony bank is smaller than
properties might be useful for both the costumers and system engineers of the bank. Although we dealt with the Sony
bank USD/JPY exchange rate in this paper, our approach is general and applicable to the other stochastic processes
in ﬁnancial markets. We hope our approach is widely used to evaluate various useful statistics in real markets.

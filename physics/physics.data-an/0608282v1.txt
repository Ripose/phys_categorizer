A data set of Hirsch indices, h, for Finnish scientists in certain ﬁelds is statistically analyzed
and ﬁtted to h(n) = P np for the n-th most-quoted scientist. The precoeﬃcient P is characteristic
for the ﬁeld and the exponent p is about -0.2 for all data sets considered. For Physics, Chemistry
and Chemical Engineering, the P are 49.7(8), 41.3(6), and 21.4(6), respectively. These p values
correspond to Pareto exponents of about -7 for the distribution of Hirsch indices h.

INTRODUCTION

Distributions for different sciences

The Hirsch index h [1, 2] provides a rough but robust
measure on the total citation impact of an individual,
until the time of observation. More exactly it means
having h papers, each cited at least h times. In addition
to persons, it also can be deﬁned for universities, journals
etc. The values are very diﬀerent for diﬀerent ﬁelds and
the question is, how to compare the values between ﬁelds?
We had available a small data set of the h values
in Chemistry, Physics, and Chemical Engineering for
Finnish scientists. A statistical study reveals an inter-
esting power-law distribution and gives a hint on the rel-
ative weighting factors that may apply between diﬀerent
ﬁelds.

II. METHOD AND RESULTS

The data were determined from the ISI Web of Knowl-
edge using the data set in General Search from 1945 on-
wards. This database only contains references in journals
to papers in journals. Most data points were obtained in
November 2005. The most-quoted one-third of the points
inside each area, k, was ﬁtted using Gnuplot to

h(n) = P np

(1)

where h(n) is the h of the n:th-most quoted scientist, P
is a precoeﬃcient and p is an exponent, found to be sur-
prisingly constant between diﬀerent ﬁelds. The obtained
values are shown in Table I and the quality of the ﬁts is
demonstrated in Fig. 1. The ﬁgures in parentheses give
the asymptotic standard error. In this data set, for the
given country at the given time, the workers in diﬀer-
ent areas mostly share the same background and general
working conditions, like the typical research-group size
and budget. Assuming that they also are equally gifted
and hard-working, we then suggest that the ratios of P
between diﬀerent ﬁelds would form a possible basis for
comparing scientiﬁc merit between ﬁelds.

Podlubny[3] recently compared the total numbers of
citations in various ﬁelds in United States. He found

them to be fairly constant from 1992 to 2001 and sug-
gested that they would form a useful normalization factor
for comparing individual scientiﬁc performance between
ﬁelds.

In Table II we compare the present relative Prel factors
(with Physics normalized to 1) to the square roots of
Podlubny’s relative citation numbers. An average of his
1992-2001 data is used.

In economic theory, V. Pareto found in 1896 [5] the
number of holders of income I in a country to scale for
high incomes as I x, with x about -2 ([5], see ref. [6, 7]).
The same law was found by Zipf to hold for word fre-
quencies in linguistics and by Lotka for numbers of pa-
pers among authors[8]. It is known in many other ﬁelds,
like size distributions of cities in a country, earthquakes,
wars etc. [7].

III. FURTHER DATA SETS

A list of the h values for 40 ’Dutch’ chemists was pub-
lished by Faas[4]. Both people of Dutch origin anywhere
in the World, and people from anywhere, working in The
Netherlands were included. As seen from Fig.2, all points
ﬁt well the values P = 105.5(2.4), p = -0.212(11).

For the Finnish p for Physics and Chemistry, the corre-
sponding Pareto exponent x would become -6.9 and -6.8,
respectively.

The main conclusions are that the P value for Chemi-
cal Engineering is about half of that for Chemistry, and
that the p values for the data sets considered are about
-0.2.

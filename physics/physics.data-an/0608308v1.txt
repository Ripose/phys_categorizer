Abstract

This paper describes the Monte Carlo simulation developed speciﬁcally for the VCS
experiments below pion threshold that have been performed at MAMI and JLab.
This simulation generates events according to the (Bethe-Heitler + Born) cross-
section behaviour and takes into account all relevant resolution-deteriorating eﬀects.
It determines the “eﬀective” solid angle for the various experimental settings which
are used for the precise determination of the photon electroproduction absolute
cross section.

1 Introduction

Virtual Compton Scattering (VCS) oﬀ the nucleon N is a valuable reaction to
study the structure of the nucleon. VCS refers to the reaction γ∗+N → γ +N ′,
where γ∗ and γ represent a virtual and a real photon, respectively. It can be
seen as an extension of Real Compton Scattering (RCS) to photon virtuality
Q2 6= 0. In this case six electromagnetic observables, called Generalized Po-
larizabilities (GPs), enter the cross section and may be determined to gain
valuable insight into the structure of the scatterer. In the real-photon limit,
Q2 = 0, two of the six independent GPs are proportional to the well-known
polarizabilities α and β obtained from RCS. The concept of GPs has ﬁrst been
worked out by Arenh¨ovel et al. [1] for nuclei and later by Guichon et al. [2]
for the nucleon.

VCS oﬀ the proton is studied using the p(e, e′p′)γ reaction: an electron scat-
ters oﬀ a proton and a real photon is produced. The scattered electron and
the recoiling proton are detected in coincidence, each in a high-resolution
magnetic spectrometer, and real-photon production events are identiﬁed by
reconstruction of the missing mass, which is zero in this reaction. The real
photon can be produced either by the incoming or by the outgoing electron
(the Bethe-Heitler contribution to the reaction) or by the nucleon. The nu-
cleon contribution contains the Born part and the non-Born part. The sum of
the Bethe-Heitler and the Born contributions will be denoted by BH+B. The
non-Born part contains the GPs, which are accessible through the deviation
of the measured p(e, e′p′)γ cross section from the BH+B cross section, the
latter being perfectly calculable once the elastic form factors of the proton are
known.

The very ﬁrst dedicated VCS experiment below pion threshold to obtain in-
formation on the GPs took place at the Mainz Microtron MAMI (Mainz,
Germany) at Q2 = 0.33 (GeV/c)2 [3]. For the kinematics of this experiment
the contribution of the GPs to the cross section had been estimated to amount
to 10% [3]. This means that the absolute cross section had to be measured
very precisely. In addition, one needed very elaborated analysis methods. The
present paper is devoted to the description of the latter, which have been
developed further and adapted to analyse also the next VCS experiment, per-
formed at the Thomas Jeﬀerson National Accelerator Laboratory JLab (New-
port News, USA) at Q2 values of 0.9 and 1.8 (GeV/c)2 [4]. Both experiments
are unpolarized and they are very similar, in apparatus as well as in method.
Most numerical examples given in this paper refer to the MAMI experiment.

The Monte Carlo code simulates p(e, e′p′)γ events comparable to those of

the experiments. The simulation generates realistic spectra in the physical
variables of interest and it has been used to determine with great accuracy
what we will call eﬀective solid angle. This eﬀective solid angle is deﬁned such
that it does not only represent the geometrical acceptance, but it also includes
the convolution of many eﬀects. The aim of the present paper is to explain how
the cross-section behaviour and the various resolution-deteriorating processes
taking place in the target and in the detection systems have been taken into
account. In addition the calculation of the simulated luminosity is explained.
Throughout the paper the cross section used in the simulation will be often
called “VCS cross section” for simplicity.

The paper is organized as follows: in section 2 the kinematics of the reaction,
a description of the experiment and the deﬁnition of the eﬀective solid an-
gle are discussed. In section 3 we outline the method used to implement the
cross-section behaviour and we deﬁne the phase space in which the events are
generated. Section 4 is devoted to a detailed description of the implementation
of the radiative eﬀects. Section 5 discusses the simulation package. Section 6
covers the determination of the simulated luminosity and section 7 the calcu-
lation of the eﬀective solid angle. Results are presented in section 8. Finally,
section 9 is a brief summary of the paper.

2 Introductory deﬁnitions

2.1 The kinematics of the reaction and the experimental realization

In the process p(e, e′p′)γ an incoming electron with momentum ~k scatters oﬀ a
proton by exchange of a virtual photon γ∗ with momentum ~q and a real photon
with momentum ~q′ is emitted. The vector ~k and the momentum vector of the
outgoing electron, ~k′, deﬁne the scattering plane. The momentum vector of the
recoiling proton, ~p′, and ~q′ deﬁne the reaction plane. The vector ~q, which is
determined as ~k− ~k′, lies in both planes. The direction of the real photon in the
CM-system of γ∗ and p is determined by the angle between the two photons,
θγγ,cm, and the angle ϕ between the scattering and the reaction plane as is
shown in ﬁgure 1 (throughout this paper all variables in the center of mass
have an index cm; if no index is given the variable is deﬁned in the laboratory
system). ϕ is deﬁned equal to 0◦ when ~q′ lies in the scattering plane and points
to the same side of ~q as ~k′. In the CM-system, γ and p′ move back to back.
In the laboratory system the recoiling proton is boosted in a (narrow) cone
around ~q, while the undetected γ can have any direction. This very welcome
feature of the VCS kinematics makes it possible to cover a large range in θγγ,cm
by detecting the proton within the moderate solid angle of a high-resolution
spectrometer.

the center of mass of γ∗ and p. In the laboratory system the proton is boosted on
a cone around ~q as shown on the right.

In the experiment a monochromatic electron beam impinges on liquid hy-
drogen, contained in a metal can of known geometry. Its temperature and
pressure are constantly monitored. To prevent local overheating of the liquid
(which would cause density ﬂuctuations and as such luminosity errors), the
beam position on the target is continuously moving using a “raster” system.
The scattered electron and the recoil proton are both detected in magnetic
spectrometers, the entrance collimators deﬁning their angular acceptances.
The electron spectrometer deﬁnes the virtual-photon acceptance. For each
electron-spectrometer setting, several proton-spectrometer settings are used
to cover the interesting part of the proton cone. As both spectrometers usu-
ally rotate in the horizontal plane, one measures essentially around ϕ = 0◦ and
ϕ = 180◦; only at suﬃciently high momentum transfer and low real-photon
energy the full proton cone is covered by the acceptance of the proton spec-
trometer.

2.2 The solid-angle deﬁnition

For an ideal experiment (free of resolution eﬀects) the cross section is deter-
mined from the number of counts detected in a given phase space bin, Nexp,
and the integrated luminosity, Lexp, via

(cid:28)

(1)

where dσ/ dΩ is a notation for the diﬀerential cross section and dΩ represents
an inﬁnitesimal bin in the phase space under study. It is clear that in order to
derive precise diﬀerential cross sections from the measured data, the solid an-
gle of the detection apparatus has to be accurately known. Using equation (1)

4

one determines the cross section averaged over the solid angle ∆Ω1, the latter
one being a purely geometrical quantity. When the cross section has a curva-
ture, ascribing the average cross section to the mean kinematics results in a
bias. One can solve this bias by ascribing the measurement to an appropriate
diﬀerent kinematics (c.f. [5]). This is, however, unpractical in our case because
the cross section depends on ﬁve kinematical variables (see section 3). In this
case one can stick to the central kinematics (or choose any other kinematics
in the bin) and apply an appropriate correction to the average cross section
in order to get an unbiased result. We choose to include this correction factor
in the solid angle by deﬁning another solid angle ∆Ω2:

· (∆Ω1 + ω) =

· ∆Ω2,

(2)

where ( dσ/ dΩ)0 is the cross section at the chosen point. The solid angle
∆Ω2 deviates from ∆Ω1 by the amount ω, which depends on the curvature
of the cross section over the bin and the chosen point in the bin. To obtain
∆Ω2 one must know with suﬃcient accuracy the cross section behaviour of
the process under study in the phase space region under consideration. In
principle, this must be the cross section which one is going to measure and
which is therefore unknown at the moment of the simulation. A suﬃciently
good approximation, however, is the BH+B cross section, since it is expected
to deviate by less than 10% from the complete p(e, e′p′)γ cross section; in
particular its curvature, which is the decisive feature in this context, should
be a very good approximation to the real one.

The solid angles ∆Ω1 or ∆Ω2 must incorporate not only the actual detection
geometry but also the various resolution eﬀects. This is why these solid angles
are called “eﬀective” and why they can only be calculated by a Monte Carlo
simulation.

The present simulation is used to calculate ∆Ω2 of the experimental setups
used in VCS experiments and, at the same time, to compare experimental
and simulated data on an absolute scale. To this end, one introduces a sim-
ulated luminosity, Lsim, equivalent to the experimental one. This simulated
luminosity is deﬁned by

Lsim =

N ′

∆Ω′h dσ
dΩ i

where h dσ/ dΩi stands for the diﬀerential cross section in the simulation ave-
raged over a well-known solid angle, ∆Ω′, and N ′
sim is the number of events

5

generated in ∆Ω′. Once the quantity Lsim is known, one calculates the ef-
fective solid angle ∆Ω (which can be ∆Ω1 or ∆Ω2), in full parallellism with
equation (1) and (2) using

∆Ω =

Nsim
dσ
dΩ

Lsim

,

(4)

where dσ/ dΩ is the cross section used in the simulation and Nsim the number
of events in ∆Ω. Sections 3 to 6 describe how the various terms of this equation
are obtained.

3 Cross section behaviour and phase space deﬁnition

3.1 The implementation of the cross section behaviour

As mentioned above, the calculation of ∆Ω2 needs as input the cross sec-
tion behaviour. The BH+B cross section, d5σ/ dk′ dΩe′ dΩγγ,cm, depends on
the variables (k, k′, θe′, θγγ,cm, ϕ), where k, k′, . . . are the moduli of the corre-
sponding three-vectors. Instead of k, k′ and θe′ one can also use qcm, q′
cm and
the photon polarisation, ε, which ensures that, in the cross-section grid used
by the simulation, only the real physical space is covered. An example of how
the cross section behaves as a function of θγγ,cm and ϕ for ﬁxed qcm, q′
cm and ε
for the MAMI kinematics is shown in ﬁgure 2. It is symmetric with respect to
the scattering plane, and therefore only a “half-sphere” is shown. One clearly
observes the two peaks corresponding to real photon emission around the in-
coming and outgoing electron directions. Over the complete angular range the
cross section varies by orders of magnitude, but in the phase space of interest
(which is away from the peak region), the cross section ﬂattens substantially.
This allows one to choose a reasonable upper limit, or envelope value, for the
cross section sampling, which cuts through the peaks.

The number of events in an inﬁnitesimal phase space bin is given by

dNbin = L

d5σ
dk′ dΩe′ dΩγγ,cm

dk′ d cos(θe′) dϕe′ d cos(θγγ,cm) dϕ,

(5)

where ϕe′ is the angle between the scattering plane and the horizontal plane
containing the axis of the spectrometers. To generate counts in the phase space
according to equation (5) one uses the acceptance-rejection method [6] in ﬁve
dimensions with a constant as envelope for the cross section. However, the
theoretical code [7] used to calculate the BH+B cross section is too slow to
be used on an event-by-event basis in the simulation. To solve this problem,

function of θγγ,cm and ϕ (qcm = 600 MeV/c, q′

cm = 45 MeV/c and ε = 0.62).

the theoretical code has been used to calculate the BH+B cross section at the
nodes of a ﬁve-dimensional grid in the variables (qcm, q′
cm, ε, θγγ,cm, ϕ). Then,
in the simulation, the cross section value is obtained by interpolating in this
grid, which makes the calculation faster by a factor of about 1000. In practice,
a logarithmic interpolation is performed, reaching an accuracy of better than
1%.

3.2 The phase space deﬁnition

The events have to be generated according to the ﬁve-fold diﬀerential BH+B
cross section in a phase-space volume ∆k′ · ∆Ωe′ · ∆Ωγγ,cm. For an eﬃcient
simulation, one wants to optimize this phase space. While being not too large,
it must cover the full acceptance of the apparatus, taking into account all
resolution eﬀects. The following ranges in the above mentioned variables are
used:

• ∆Ωe′ = ∆cos(θe′) · ∆ϕe′: the maximum and minimum values of θe′ and ϕe′
are determined taking into account the shape of the extended target, the
position of the spectrometer and the shape of its entrance collimator and

7

multiple scattering eﬀects.

• ∆k′: the lower bound is given by the lower limit of the momentum ac-
ceptance of the electron spectrometer. The upper bound is given by the
maximum momentum of elastically scattered electrons in the ∆Ωe′ bin de-
ﬁned above. This upper bound is ﬁxed independently of the position of the
elastic line relative to the electron spectrometer’s momentum acceptance,
since an electron, scattered with a momentum larger than the maximum
accepted momentum, can still be detected due to energy losses before the
spectrometer’s entrance.

• ∆Ωγγ,cm: the outgoing photon can go in any direction in the CM-system,
therefore events are generated in the full solid angle 4π. As a result, the
outgoing proton is also sampled in its full angular phase space, i.e. the
full proton cone in the laboratory. This ensures that all detectable events
are indeed taken into account, even with resolution-smearing at the target.
Another advantage is that the simulation can be run for several proton-
spectrometer settings all at once. For each generated proton, the simulation
performs a loop over the various proton-spectrometer settings and tests if
the particle is accepted or not.

The ﬁve-fold diﬀerential cross section depends on the incoming electron mo-
mentum at the interaction point, k, but it is not diﬀerential in this variable.
However, although the beam is monochromatic (at the 10−4 level), k is not
a constant. Each incoming electron loses energy in the target by collisions
and by external bremsstrahlung in the material before the vertex point and
by internal bremsstrahlung at the vertex point itself (see section 4.1). The
resulting distribution of k at the interaction point is depicted on ﬁgure 3 for
an incoming electron momentum of 766.4 MeV/c and a hydrogen target of
340 mg/cm2.

4 The radiation tail

4.1 The necessity to simulate a radiative tail

The radiative tail is a well-known feature of electron scattering experiments:
after correction for the energy losses by collisions, the energy spectrum of the
scattered electron shows a peak at the kinematically expected value, but this
peak is accompanied by a radiation tail to lower energies [8]. This tail is due
to energy loss of the incoming and outgoing electron via ionisation, external
bremsstrahlung in the materials of the target and up to the spectrometer’s
entrances and via internal real radiation in the scattering process itself. These
eﬀects are of course also present in VCS experiments and give rise to the radia-
tive tail observed in the spectrum of the missing mass squared M 2
X, deﬁned as

bremsstrahlung (before scattering) are taken into account. The insert shows a re-
binned zoom on the peak region in linear scale.

(k + p − k′ − p′)2 (bold characters represent the four-vector of the particles).
The resulting tail is shown in ﬁgure 4.

For the calculation of the eﬀective solid angles, one needs a recipe to generate
in the Monte Carlo simulation the radiation tail as observed. Indeed, experi-
mentally one applies a cut in the M 2
X spectrum around 0 to select real-photon
production events, and the same cut must be applied to the simulated events.
The simulation reproduces the radiative tail well, which is very important
because one wants the ﬁnal cross-section result to be independent of the cut
in M 2
X. In fact, the inﬂuence of the position of the cut in the missing mass
squared on the resulting cross section was lower than 1 % in the MAMI case.
By reproducing the radiation tail in the simulation, the part of the radiative
corrections which changes the kinematics of the reaction is taken into account,
and the simulated radiative tail is properly convoluted with the detector ac-
ceptance (these points will be discussed below). The other part of the radiative
corrections is applied as a constant factor to the calculated cross section.

Internal and external real radiation are incorporated in the simulation. These
processes are simulated by sampling in an energy-loss distribution for the in-
coming and outgoing electron. In the simulation only the electron’s energy
is changed, while its direction is assumed to be unaﬀected by the radiation
eﬀects (angular peaking approximation). For ionisation not only energy losses
are taken into account for the electron and proton, but also multiple scatter-

ing is incorporated in the simulation. The used probability distributions are
discussed in the following subsections.

4.2 Ionisation and multiple scattering

Collisions of the particles in the materials of the target are simulated by apply-
ing an energy loss and a scattering angle. The program glando of the CERN-
libraries [9] is used to generate a realistic energy-loss distribution based on
the mean value of the energy loss, which is calculated using the Bethe-Bloch
equation. The deﬂection caused by multiple scattering is treated as explained
in [10].

4.3 External radiative eﬀects

An electron passing through a slice of material of thickness t (in units of
radiation length) emits photons due to bremsstrahlung. The energy loss of the
electron, ∆E, is equal to the sum of the energies of all produced photons. The
distribution of ∆E is given in very good approximation by [11] (t < 0.05)

E0 is the kinetic energy of the electron before bremsstrahlung and b = 4

10

To generate the energy loss of the electron, one samples an energy loss ac-
cording to the distribution (6) using the acceptance-rejection method, using
1
∆E as an envelope. To avoid variable overﬂows in the code for very small ∆E,
the introduction of a lower limit, ∆Ell, is necessary. In the present simulation
∆Ell = 1 keV (which is well below the resolution of the experiment). Finally
the electron energy is decreased by the obtained value for ∆E.

In the simulation of the bremsstrahlung, only the energy of the electron
is changed, which is equivalent with photon emission along the electron-
momentum direction. This is a good approximation, since bremsstrahlung is
very forwardly peaked. The smaller ∆E, the better this approximation. More-
over, the scattering angle due to bremsstrahlung is small compared to that
from multiple scattering.

4.4 Internal radiative eﬀects

4.4.1 Virtual and Real Internal corrections

The cross section for the p(e, e′p′)γ reaction, σth, i.e. a process involving only
one virtual photon and one real photon, cannot be measured directly, since
in reality the pure p(e, e′p′)γ process is always accompanied by additional
photons, either real or virtual. These internal radiative eﬀects give rise to a
measured cross section, σexp, which deviates from σth:

The correction term δtot is negative and depends on the cut in the radiative
tail accompanying the scattering process. The internal radiative corrections
to VCS are discussed in great detail in [12]. Written in ﬁrst order, one gets

δvac accounts for vacuum polarisation diagrams, δver is the vertex correction
and δrad is the correction for radiation in the one additional photon approxi-
mation. One can approximately take into account higher order radiative cor-
rections by writing [12]:

σexp = (1 + δtot)σth.

where Ecm (E

Sp is the Spence function, eg. [12]. The virtual correction terms δver and δvac
are independent of the cut in the radiative tail, ∆Ec
cm, and nearly constant
for the phase space of interest. The correction for these eﬀects will be applied
by a constant correction factor to the measured cross section. Since only the
ﬁrst term of δrad is dependent on ∆Ec
cm, this term is related to the radiative
tail. The other terms of δrad are independent of the cut position and they can
be considered to be constant over the phase space of interest. Therefore they
will be treated in the same way as δver and δvac.

The radiative tail appears in the spectrum of the missing mass squared M 2

Given the relationship (13) one could apply the correction (9) to obtain σth,
without including the internal radiative eﬀects in the simulation. This proce-
dure would only be valid if the acceptance of the detectors would not cut in
some parts of the phase space more severely in M 2
X than the cut on the miss-
ing mass itself. This, however, is not the case in the experiments. Therefore
the simulation must generate the full radiative tail by implementing electron
energy losses by radiation, reproducing in this way realistic spectra.

which is normalised to 1. Remark the similarity between Iint(E, ∆E, a) and the

which is well known in literature as equivalent radiator [13], i.e. an imaginary
radiator placed before and after the scattering center to generate internal real
radiation.

The recipe used to introduce the radiation tail due to internal radiation in the
Monte Carlo simulation is:

(1) Sample an energy loss, ∆Ee, according to the distribution (17) with E =

incoming electron energy Ee.

(2) Generate the kinematics of a p(e, e′p′)γ event at the vertex (see ﬁgure 1)
for the reduced energy Ee − ∆Ee of the incoming electron. The events are
sampled according to the cross section at this reduced energy. After the
scattering process the outgoing electron has an energy E′
e at the vertex.

(3) Sample an energy loss, ∆E′

Remark that the above procedure implies electron-energy losses both at the
incoming and the outgoing electron sides, which is fully consistent with the
exponentiation idea. Again, for numerical reasons, one has to introduce a
∆Ell-value to sample in the Iint distribution. In practice the sampling is done
uniformly in the integrated distribution of Iint, then solving analytically for
∆E. To calculate the equivalent-radiator thickness a, one needs the value of
Q2 for the event, which one can only calculate after the complete process has
taken place. However, due to the slow variation of ln( Q2
m2 ), one gets a very
good approximation by using the value of Q2 given by elastic electron-proton
scattering at the nominal beam momentum ki and scattering angle θe.

5 The simulation package

The simulation consists of three separate programs: vcssim, resolution and
analysis. The ﬁrst one, vcssim, generates p(e, e′p′)γ events in the target,
applying ionisation energy losses and multiple scattering to all charged parti-
cles and radiative eﬀects to the electrons. The outgoing electron and proton
are tracked up to the entrance of the spectrometers, where the collimator-
acceptance cut is applied. This program produces two output ﬁles: one con-
tains the generated events and the other one contains statistical information.
The second program, resolution, applies the resolution eﬀects of the spec-
trometers on the events generated by vcssim, producing a dataﬁle with the
events aﬀected by the spectrometer resolution. The third program, analysis,
analyses the output dataﬁle from resolution in the same way experimental
data are analysed and produces a third dataﬁle. The latter contains a set of
reconstructed variables to be compared to the experimental ones. The mod-
ular structure of the package has the advantage that one can change e.g. the
spectrometer-resolution eﬀects or the analysis, without having to redo the ﬁrst
step, which is the most time-consuming one. The three programs are described
in more detail below.

5.1 Vcssim

Using all necessary input parameters, the program ﬁrst deﬁnes the phase space
in which it is going to sample (see section 3.2). In order to obtain an event the
following steps are taken: ﬁrst the transverse beam position on the target is
generated in a horizontal and vertical distribution similar to the experimental
one. An interaction point along the beamline is chosen uniformly inside the
target length. The incoming electron is subject to multiple scattering, energy
loss by collision and external bremsstrahlung in the target wall and the liquid
hydrogen till the reaction vertex. Then the real internal radiation at the VCS
vertex is simulated by an additional energy loss of the incoming electron using
the equivalent-radiator approach discussed in section 4.4.2. Then the four-
vector k of the electron inducing the actual VCS process is obtained. The
energy loss through radiation can be so large, that k can already be too small
to give any detectable electron in the ﬁnal state. At this ﬁxed value of k, the
highest value of k′ is given by the kinematics of the elastic process ep → e′p′.
So at this point a test is made if the momentum of the elastically scattered
electron is high enough to be accepted in the electron spectrometer. If the test
is negative, the event is terminated, and a new event is generated starting all
over again.

If the test is positive, one generates a scattered electron in the labframe and

14

an outgoing real photon direction in the CM frame. The variables cos θe′, ϕe′,
cos θγγ,cm, ϕ and k′ are all sampled uniformly in their phase space. Remark
that the outgoing real photon energy is already determined by the electron
kinematics. If the generated kinematics is physically possible, the cross section
is calculated for this event by interpolation in the BH+B grid of section 3.1.
With this value for the cross section one samples a random number between
zero and the envelope value. If the value is higher than the calculated cross
section, the event did not pass the acceptance-rejection test and the event is
terminated.

As a next step, one has to determine whether the scattered electron and out-
going proton enter the acceptances of the spectrometers. To this end, the
momenta and directions of the electron and proton have to be calculated.
Based on the variables θe′, ϕe′ and k′, one can immediately calculate the four-
vectors of the scattered electron and the virtual photon. Then the momentum
four-vector in the center of mass for the outgoing real photon can be calcu-
lated using θγγ,cm and ϕ. The real photon is transformed to the lab to obtain
the four-vector q′. The four-vector of the outgoing proton can now be calcu-
lated as p′ = p + k − k′ − q′. The scattered electron is ﬁrst subject to real
internal radiation energy loss. Then it loses energy by collision and by exter-
nal radiation and undergoes multiple scattering in the various materials from
the vertex point to the entrance collimator of the spectrometer. Similarly, the
outgoing proton will undergo energy loss by collision and multiple scattering
on its way to the collimator (bremsstrahlung is negligible for such a heavy
particle). Several options are proposed to calculate the collisional energy loss
of particles: the mean energy loss, the most probable energy loss, or a realis-
tic energy-loss distribution (Landau distribution). For the calculation of the
eﬀective solid angle this last option was chosen. The spectrometer acceptance
is deﬁned in diﬀerent ways depending on the experiment. In the case of the
MAMI experiment the angular acceptance is deﬁned by the collimators at the
entrance of the spectrometers, in the case of the JLab experiment it is deﬁned
by cuts in a ﬁve-dimensional phase space.

The output of the vcssim program is twofold: ﬁrst a ﬁle is produced containing
the events accepted by both spectrometers. One stores the kinematics at the
vertex, the coordinates of the interaction point, and the momenta and angles
of the particles at the spectrometer entrances. Also a proton-spectrometer
index is stored, since several proton-spectrometer settings can be deﬁned and
ﬁlled simultaneously in one simulation run. The second output ﬁle contains
the simulated luminosity Lsim (see section 6) and some statistical information
regarding the simulation run.

15

5.2 Resolution

The second program, resolution, introduces the resolution eﬀects of the spec-
trometers. In the experiment, for each particle seen in the set of two double
vertical drift chambers (VDCs) the trajectory, measured in the focal plane, is
traced back to the target using the spectrometer optics. This yields four inde-
pendent variables at the target (the momentum modulus, two projected angles
and one position coordinate). The accuracy obtained on these target variables
reﬂects the resolution of the apparatus. The program resolution starts from
the initial target variables (delivered by vcssim) and modiﬁes them by adding
the errors. Three options to realize this are discussed below.

As a ﬁrst option one can simply make use of Gaussian-distributed resolution
eﬀects on each target variable independently, ignoring error correlations. In
this scheme, the diﬀerence between the initial target variable and the modiﬁed
one is sampled in a Gaussian distribution of ﬁxed width.

In the experiment, the resolution eﬀects of the VDCs will cause correlations
in the resolution eﬀects on the reconstructed target variables due to the spec-
trometer optics. The second option reproduces these correlations. The consis-
tency of the drift times with a straight line is used as estimate for the error on
a track-by-track basis. In this way, also eﬀects from multiple scattering within
the chamber and from the used algorithm are eﬀectively included [14]. After
adding quadratically the contribution of multiple scattering in the spectrome-
ter exit window, one obtains the total error on the detector coordinates, which
is propagated through the known spectrometer optics to yield the error on the
target variables. From the experimental data one can ﬁll a four-dimensional
histogram for each spectrometer, where each dimension corresponds to the er-
ror on a given target variable. In this way one keeps track of error correlations
(signs excluded) between the four target variables. The binning is chosen with
equal width on the logarithm of the errors, which describes the distribution
very precisely around the most probable value and suﬃciently precisely in the
long tails of the distribution, extending over four orders of magnitude, rela-
tively to the width of the central peak. For each event the simulation samples
in the four-dimensional histogram, yielding the width of the Gaussian error
distribution on each target variable. Then one samples for this event in the
obtained Gaussian distributions and one gets the modiﬁed target variables.
This method has been applied in the analysis of the MAMI VCS experiment.

As a third option, one can implement the resolution eﬀects in the simulation
directly at the detector level. In this scheme, the accepted particle is trans-
ported to the focal plane of the spectrometer, where two types of errors are
generated: 1) multiple scattering through the various materials, 2) the global
resolution of the drift chambers (as deduced from experimental studies). For

16

each particle, two tracks are considered: one with and one without these focal
plane resolution eﬀects. As in the second option, one uses the full spectrom-
eter optics to transport the tracks back to the target. Now the quantity of
interest is just the diﬀerence between the two tracks for the same particle.
This diﬀerence represents the resolution eﬀects on the target variables. Since
one uses the diﬀerence between the two tracks, one can approximate the op-
tical transport from target to focal plane: it does not need to be the exact
reverse of the optical transport from focal plane to target. The method gen-
erates error correlations at the target, signs included. Large resolution tails
are introduced at the level of the detector coordinates, e.g. by sampling in
the sum of two Gaussian distributions with very diﬀerent widths for the drift
chamber resolution. This method has been applied in the analysis of the JLab
VCS experiment.

The output is a dataﬁle containing the same variables as the one from vcssim,
but now they include also the spectrometers’ resolution eﬀects. This dataﬁle
is comparable to the experimental one.

5.3 Analysis

The third and ﬁnal part of the simulation, the analysis program, performs
the full event reconstruction as in the analysis of the experimental data. From
the reconstructed target coordinates, one ﬁrst calculates the vertex point and
from this the pathlengths of the particles in target materials and the corre-
sponding (mean collisional) energy losses. The particle momenta are corrected
for these energy losses, yielding the four-vectors at the vertex point. Then the
complete reaction kinematics is reconstructed, including the missing particle.
Then one can compare e.g. the distribution in missing mass squared M 2
X to
the experimental one, as shown on ﬁgure 4.

6 The determination of the simulated luminosity Lsim

As it is clear from equation (4) one needs to know the simulated luminosity
in order to obtain the eﬀective solid angle. In the experiment, the luminosity,
Lexp, is obtained as the product of the number of incoming electrons and the
target thickness and is totally independent of the reaction under study.

The simulation uses a diﬀerent approach: the luminosity in the simulation,
Lsim, is calculated from the cross-section samples of the acceptance-rejection
method, i.e. from the reaction itself. The method is most eﬃcient and gives
a very accurate result, provided the procedure is established carefully. One

17

counts the number of samples, N, generated during a simulation run in the
luminosity phase space, L.P.S., which is a sub-part of the total simulation
phase space (see section 3.2). Simultaneously, the cross section is integrated
over this luminosity phase space. According to equation (3) Lsim is then simply
given by

Lsim =

L.P.S.
R

N

d5σ
dk′ dΩe′ dΩγγ,cm

dk′ dΩe′ dΩγγ,cm

.

(18)

As such, Lsim is actually calculated in a reverse way, i.e. at the end of a
simulation run, once the number of generated events is known.

In principle one is free to deﬁne the size of the luminosity phase space. However
one will have to choose a luminosity phase space that is smaller than the
simulation phase space.

The ﬁrst complication is due to the method used to implement the cross-
section behaviour. As mentioned in section 3.1, the acceptance-rejection method
with constant envelope is used, with a rejection level of about 90%. However,
among these rejected samples a large fraction can be kept to calculate the
value of the cross-section integral over the luminosity phase space. One just
has to make sure that the luminosity phase space does not overlap with the
regions of the simulation phase space where the cross section is larger than
the envelope, since the acceptance-rejection method does not work in these
regions.

The second complication is connected to the fact that the real k distribution
has a low-momentum tail and to the fact that the cross section depends on the
value of k. If all VCS inducing electrons would have the same momentum k, one
could immediately apply equation (18). This case is explained in subsection
6.1. The case of the real k distribution, for which one cannot apply equation
(18) directly, is discussed in subsection 6.2.

6.1 The deﬁnition of the luminosity phase space for the case of constant k

If all interacting electrons would have the same momentum, ki (the nominal
beam momentum), the cross-section integral of equation (18) would be given
by

Iσ =

ZL.P.S.

d5σ
dk′ dΩe′ dΩγγ,cm

dk′ dΩe′ dΩγγ,cm.

(19)

One has to deﬁne the luminosity phase space as an integration range in
dΩγγ,cm, dΩe′ and dk′: this is done using a 5-dimensional box in (k′, θe′,
ϕe′, θγγ,cm, ϕ), where the limits on each variable are independent of the other
variables. For example, for the MAMI experiment the box has the following
dimensions:

• In ∆k′: for the minimum of k′, the lower limit of the electron spectrometer

has to be careful not to cross the envelope value with the cross-section
values in the regions in ∆Ωγγ,cm and in ∆Ωe′ deﬁned above. Indeed, as k′
increases at ﬁxed ki, one approaches the elastic kinematics and as such the
cross section rises. To stay far enough away from the elastic kinematics,
the maximum value of k′ for the integration range is taken equal to k′

6.2 Taking into account the realistic distribution of the incoming momentum

k

Due to energy losses the electron momentum at the vertex point becomes
distributed as shown in ﬁgure 3. In this realistic case one could divide this
distribution in small bins in k and apply equation (18) to calculate the partial
luminosity for each bin j

(20)

Lj =

Nj
Iσ,j

,

19

where Iσ,j is given by expression (19) and Nj is the number of accepted sam-
ples, both evaluated in a luminosity phase space similar to the one of section
6.1, where the range in k is limited to the bin j. Then Lsim would be equal to

j Lj. There are two limitations to this procedure:

P

(1) It is not possible to use formula (20) on the whole incoming electron
momentum distribution, because the cross-section grid does not contain
cross-section samples for the entire 0 → ki incoming momentum range.
One has to cut somewhere in the k-range, hereby deﬁning a cut value
kcut.

(2) For small values of k, the elastic line drawn on ﬁgure 5 lies totally below
min, therefore
min and the luminosity phase space can not be deﬁned as

the lower bound of the electron-momentum acceptance k′
k′
cut lies below k′
in section 6.1 for these electrons.

To solve these problems the cross-section integration will be performed in a
limited range of incoming electron momentum, i.e. a bin in k for which the
L.P.S. can be deﬁned as in section 6.1. This will yield a partial luminosity. The
total luminosity will then be obtained by a simple renormalization procedure.

6.2.1 The k-range for the cross section integration

Quite obviously, the cross section integration of equation (19) should be per-
formed for the incoming electron momenta that are closest to the beam mo-
mentum ki. Therefore one deﬁnes a range of the type [kcut, ki]. The luminosity
phase space is then deﬁned as in section 6.1. The value of k′
cut is calculated
using the elastic line at the lowest incoming momentum of the bin, i.e. at
k = kcut.

Of course, when one lowers the value of kcut, one reduces the size of the lumi-
nosity phase space (due to the choice of k′
cut), and the statistical error on the
luminosity increases. So one should keep kcut close enough to ki. For example
for the MAMI experiment the range [ki − 3 MeV/c, ki] was chosen. It contains
about 80% of all incoming electrons, and yields a statistical error on Lsim well
below 1 %.

During execution the number of samples in the luminosity phase space, NL.P.S.,
is counted and the integral over the cross section in the L.P.S., Iσ, is calculated.
NL.P.S. is the number of samples accepted by the acceptance-rejection method
of section 3.1. At the end of execution, the partial luminosity Lsim,3M eV /c is
given by NL.P.S./Iσ.

20

6.2.2 The renormalization factor

By the method described above we know the luminosity Lsim,3M eV /c corre-
sponding to a fraction, f , of all incoming electrons, which have a momentum
higher than ki−3 MeV/c. This fraction f is easily calculated in the simulation:
one counts the total number of k-values that have been generated, Ntot, and
the number of values that have been generated above the threshold of ki − 3
MeV/c, N3M eV /c. At the end one has f = N3M eV /c/Ntot. However, one needs to
know the total luminosity Lsim according to all incoming electrons. One can
obtain the right value by correcting for the electrons one did not count in the
calculation of Lsim,3M eV /c. Since the luminosity is independent of the reaction
under study, the total luminosity Lsim is obtained by dividing Lsim,3M eV /c by
f .

7 Calculation of the eﬀective solid angle

The data in the output ﬁle from the analysis program, in combination with
simulated luminosity Lsim from the vcssim program are used to calculate the
eﬀective solid angle for any given bin in the phase space, applying equation (4):

Nsim

∆Ω =

Lsim.

d5σsim
dk′ dΩe′ dΩγγ,cm

,

(21)

where d5σsim/ dk′ dΩe′ dΩγγ,cm is now the diﬀerential cross section for the
p(e, e′p′)γ reaction, used in the simulation and Nsim the number of counts
in the bin. ∆Ω is similar as in equation (1) or (2), with now the speciﬁc
dimension of (sr2· MeV/c), as can be deduced from equation 21. By applying
energy losses for radiative eﬀects in the simulation, a part of the radiative
correction is automatically taken into account in ∆Ω. If the cross section is
taken to be a constant value over the complete phase space, equation (21) will
yield ∆Ω1. Calculating the cross section from the data using this ∆Ω1 yields
the experimental cross section averaged over the bin. On the other hand, if
the simulation has been performed using the BH+B cross section, the quantity
d5σsim/ dk′ dΩe′ dΩγγ,cm in equation (21) equals the BH+B cross-section value
at a given phase-space point, which can be chosen anywhere, preferentially
in the bin. This procedure will give rise to ∆Ω2, comparable to equation (2).
Applying this ∆Ω2 to the measured data will result in the actual cross-section
value at a given phase-space point. In order to get a precise result, the cross
section in the simulation must have a behaviour very close to the true cross-
section shape.

If necessary, one can even use an iteration procedure to improve the value of

∆Ω1 is obtained by running the simulation with a ﬂat cross section, for ∆Ω2 the
BH+B cross section is used. ∆Ω3 is the same quantity as ∆Ω2, but for a simulation
without radiative eﬀects. The purely statistical errors are smaller than the size of
the symbols.

∆Ω2 by implementing in the simulation a cross section of the type BH+B plus
a polarizability eﬀect. This procedure was tested for the two experiments. In
the case of MAMI, the relative change of ∆Ω2 was smaller than 1 %, hence
the iterations had a negligible eﬀect on the physics observables (the GPs).
In the case of JLab, the relative change of ∆Ω2 was larger, typically a few
percent, translating into signiﬁcant changes of the physics observables: after
the ﬁrst (resp. second) iteration, the GPs reached ∼ 70 % (resp. 90 %) of their
convergence value. The full convergence was obtained after the third iteration.

8 Results of the eﬀective solid angle calculation

As an example, ﬁgure 6 shows the obtained eﬀective solid angles at q′
cm =
45 MeV/c (ε = 0.62 and qcm = 600 MeV/c). The phase space is deﬁned by
40 MeV/c < q′
cm < 50 MeV/c, 158◦ < ϕ < 202◦. The statistical error on the
eﬀective solid angle in the plateau region is about 1%. ∆Ω2 is the solid angle
obtained by generating the events according to the BH+B cross section. A
simulation with a constant cross section gives ∆Ω1. It turns out that for this
setting the diﬀerence between ∆Ω1 and ∆Ω2 is up to the order of 10%. It is
also interesting to run the simulation without radiative eﬀects, which results
in ∆Ω3. The right panel of ﬁgure 6 shows clearly that radiative eﬀects have to
be included in the simulation, since there is no common scaling factor between
∆Ω2 and ∆Ω3 for the complete phase space.

9 Summary

The Monte Carlo simulation described in this paper has been developed for the
analysis of the VCS experiment at MAMI and has been adapted afterwards
for the analysis of the VCS experiment at JLab. It has been used to gener-
ate realistic observable spectra, which can be compared with the measured
ones, and to determine accurately eﬀective solid angles which also account
for the radiative processes accompanying the VCS reaction. The use of a ﬁve-
dimensional cross-section grid covering the complete simulation phase space
allows to generate events according to the Bethe-Heitler+Born cross section at
a very acceptable rate, using the acceptance-rejection method with a constant
envelope. External and internal radiation of real photons are implemented in a
well-founded way by generating realistic radiative tails and convoluting these
eﬀects with the acceptance of the detection system.

The simulation described above is ﬂexible. All resolution deteriorating eﬀects
can independently be switched on or oﬀ and it is possible to use a constant
cross section or the BH+B cross section to generate events. Due to the multi-
ple proton-spectrometer option the yield in several proton-arm settings for one
electron-spectrometer setting can be simulated in one run, while the modular-
ity of the code gives the possibility to study spectrometer-resolution eﬀects in
an eﬃcient way. Finally, the program is general enough to allow adaptation
to many other processes, including e.g. elastic scattering and pion electropro-
duction.

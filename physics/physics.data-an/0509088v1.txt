We theoretically study long-term trends in the statistics of record-breaking daily temperatures
and validate these predictions using Monte Carlo simulations and data from the city of Philadelphia,
for which 126 years of daily temperature data is available. Using extreme statistics, we derive the
number and the magnitude of record temperature events, based on the observed Gaussian daily
temperatures distribution in Philadelphia, as a function of the number of elapsed years from the
start of the data. We further consider the case of global warming, where the mean temperature
systematically increases with time. We argue that the current warming rate is insuﬃcient to mea-
surably inﬂuence the frequency of record temperature events over the time range of the observations,
a conclusion that is supported by numerical simulations and the Philadelphia temperature data.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Almost every summer, there is a heat wave somewhere
in the US that garners much popular attention in the
press [1]. These hot spells are accompanied by local
news reports of record high temperatures for particular
cities, where the maximum temperature is higher than
all previously recorded high temperatures for that day of
the year. Daily temperature records for US cities extend
back 100–140 years [2, 3], and the probability of breaking
a record temperature is strongly dependent on the length
of the record. Intuitively, one should expect many more
record-breaking temperatures after only 10 years of ob-
servations, and far fewer after 100 years of observations.

A natural question that arises during heat waves is
whether global warming is to blame. In this work, we in-
vestigate whether the magnitude and frequency of record-
breaking temperatures can be inﬂuenced by systematic
climatic changes, such as global warming. The issue of
record-breaking temperatures is somewhat separate from
an extreme event, deﬁned as an observation that falls
outside a speciﬁed threshold of the climatological tem-
perature distribution [4]. Thus, for example, if a city’s
record temperature for a particular day is 40◦C, then
an increase in the frequency of daily temperatures above
36◦C (i.e., above the 90th percentile) may be an extreme
event, but not a record-breaking event. Trends in ex-
treme temperatures and weather events are likely to be
impacted by climate change, and is an area of active re-

search [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] Studying extreme events is also
the best way to assess agricultural, ecological, and hu-
man health eﬀects due to climate change [10]. Here we
examine record-breaking temperatures because they are
regularly reported by the media during heat waves, and
they play a strong role in the public perception of climate
change.

We focus on the statistics of daily temperature ex-
tremes in the city of Philadelphia, for which data are
readily available on the web for the period 1874–1999
[11]. This data indicate that the daily temperature dis-
tribution is well-approximated by a Gaussian (Sec. II).
We then apply basic ideas from extreme value statistics
in Sec. III to predict the magnitude of the jump in the
extreme temperature when a new record is set and the
frequency of record temperatures in a given year. These
predictions are derived for an arbitrary daily tempera-
ture distribution and then we work out speciﬁc results
for the idealized case of an exponential and then for the
realistic Gaussian daily temperature distribution.

Although individual record temperature events are
ﬂuctuating quantities, the average size of the tempera-
ture jumps between successive records and the frequency
of these records are systematically varying functions of
time [12]. This systematic behavior permits us to make
meaningful comparisons between our theoretical predic-
tions, numerical simulations (Sec. IV), and the data for
record temperature events in Philadelphia (Sec. V). Fi-
nally, we investigate the eﬀect of a slow global warm-
ing trend on the statistics of record-high and record-
low temperature events in Sec. VI. We argue that the
presently-available 126 years of data, coupled with the
current global warming rate in Philadelphia, is insuﬃ-
cient to meaningfully alter the statistics of record tem-
perature events compared to the predictions based on a

stationary temperature. This conclusion is the main re-
sult of this paper. Finally, we summarize our results and
oﬀer some perspectives in Sec. VII.

II. DAILY TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION

The temperature data for Philadelphia was obtained
from a website within the Earth and Mineral Sciences
department at Penn. State University [11]. The data in-
clude both the low and high temperatures in Philadelphia
for each day between 1874–1999. The data is reported as
an integer with units of degrees Fahrenheit, so we antici-
pate an error of
1◦F. No information is provided about
the accuracy of the measurement or the precise location
where the temperature is measured. Thus there is no
provision for correcting for the “heat island” eﬀect if the
weather station is at a location that has become increas-
ingly urbanized during the observation period. For each
day, we also document the middle temperature, deﬁned
as the average of the daily high and daily low.

Over the 126 years of data, the annual high temper-
ature in Philadelphia has increased by approximately
1.94◦C [13] compared to the well-documented global
warming rate of 0.6
0.2◦C over the past century [14]. On
the other hand, there does not seem to be a systematic
trend in the dependence of the annual low temperature
on the year over the entire range of data. The hottest
day recorded in Philadelphia—41.1◦C (106◦F)—occurred
on August 7, 1918, while the coldest day—
23.9◦C
(
−

11◦F)—occurred on February 9, 1934.
To understand the magnitude and frequency of daily
record temperatures, we ﬁrst need the underlying tem-
perature distribution for each day of the year. Because
temperatures have been recorded for only 126 years, it is
not possible to obtain a smooth temperature distribution
for each individual day. To mitigate this paucity of data,
we aggregate the temperatures over a 9-day range and
then use this aggregated data to deﬁne the temperature
distribution for the middle day in this range. Thus, as an
example, for the temperature distribution on January 5,
we aggregate all 126 years of temperatures from January
1–9 (1134 data points). We also use the middle tempera-
ture for each day to deﬁne the temperature distribution.
Fig. 1 shows these aggregated temperature distribu-
tions for four representative days—the 5th of January,
April, July, and October. Each distribution is shifted
vertically to make them all non-overlapping. We also
subtracted the mean temperature from each of the dis-
tributions, so that they are all centered about zero. Vi-
sually, we obtain good ﬁts to these distributions with the
(∆T )2/2σ2
Gaussian P (∆T )
, where ∆T is the devi-
ation of the temperature from its mean value, and with
σ
5.07, 4.32, 4.12, and 3.14 for 1/5, 4/5, 10/5, and 7/5,
respectively. We will therefore use a Gaussian daily tem-
perature distribution as the input to our investigation of
the frequency of record temperatures in the next section.
An important caveat needs to be made about the daily

temperature distribution. Physically, the daily tem-
perature distribution cannot be Gaussian ad inﬁnitum.
Rather, the distribution must cut oﬀ more sharply at
ﬁnite temperature values that reﬂect basic physical lim-
itations (such as the boiling points of water and nitro-
gen). We will show in the next section that such a cutoﬀ
inﬂuences the average waiting time between successive
temperature records on a given day.

Notice that the width of the daily temperature distri-
bution is largest in the winter and smallest in the sum-
mer. Another intriguing aspect of the daily distributions
is the tail behavior. For January 5, there are deviations
from a Gaussian both at the high- and low-temperature
extremes. For the distributions on April 5 and October
5, there is an enhancement only on the high-temperature
side. This enhancement is especially pronounced for the
case of April 5, which roughly corresponds to the sea-
son where record high temperatures are most likely to
occur. What is not possible to determine with 126 years
of data is whether the true temperature distribution is
Gaussian up to the cutoﬀ points and the enhancement
results from relatively little data, or whether the true
temperature distribution on April 5 actually has a slower
than Gaussian decay on the high-temperature side.

III. EVOLUTION OF RECORD
TEMPERATURES

We now determine theoretically the frequency and
magnitude of record temperature events. The schematic
evolution of these two characteristics are sketched in

Fig. 2 for the case of record high temperatures. Each time
a record high is set, we document the year ti when the ith
record occurred and the corresponding record high tem-
perature Ti. Under the (unrealistic) assumptions that
the temperatures for each day are independent and iden-
tical, we now calculate the average values of Ti and ti
and their underlying probability distributions [15, 16].

FIG. 2: Schematic evolution of the record high temperature
on a speciﬁed day for each passing year. Each dot represents
a daily high temperature for diﬀerent years. The ﬁrst temper-
ature is by deﬁnition the zeroth record temperature T0. This
event occurs in year t0 = 0. Successive record temperatures
T1, T2, T3, . . . occur in years t1, t2, t3, . . ..

Suppose that the daily temperature distribution is
p(T ). Two important subsidiary distributions needed to
determine record temperature statistics are: (i) the prob-
ability that a randomly-drawn temperature exceeds T ,
p>(T ), and (ii) the probability that that this randomly-
selected temperature is less than T , p<(T ). These distri-
butions are [17]:

We now determine the kth record temperature Tk re-
cursively. We use the terminology of record high temper-
atures, but the same formalism applies for record lows.
Clearly T0 coincides with the mean of the daily temper-
0 T p(T ) dT . The next record

This formula actually contains a sleight of hand. More
properly, we should average the above expression over the
probability distribution for T0 to obtain the true average
value of T1 rather than merely using the average value of
T0 in the lower limit of the integral. Eq. (2) gives what
we term the expected value of Tk, rather than its true
average. We will show how to compute the average value
shortly.

Proceeding recursively, the relation between successive

expected record temperatures is given by

where the above caveat about using the expected value
of Tk in the lower limit, rather than the average over the
(as yet) unknown distribution of Tk, still applies.

We now compute

Pk(T ), the probability that the kth
record temperature equals T ; this distribution is subject
P0(T ) = p(T ). For the kth record
to the initial condition
temperature, the following conditions must be satisﬁed
(refer to Fig. 2):
(i) the previous record temperature
T ′ must be less than T , (ii) the next n temperatures,
with n arbitrary, must all be less than T ′, and (iii) the
last temperature must equal T . Writing the appropriate
probabilities for each of these events, we obtain

This formula recursively gives the probability distribu-
tion for each record temperature in terms of the distri-
bution for the previous record.

Let us now determine to the expected time between
successive records. Suppose that the current record tem-
perature equals Tk and let qn(Tk) be the probability that
a new record high—the (k + 1)st—is set n years later.
For this new record, the ﬁrst n
1 highs after the cur-
rent record must all be less than Tk, while the nth high
temperature must exceed Tk. Thus

qn(Tk) = p<(Tk)n

1 p>(Tk) .

We emphasize that this waiting time applies for a spec-
iﬁed value of Tk. If the expected value of Tk is used in
Eq. (6), we thus obtain the expected value of tk. To
obtain the average waiting time, we ﬁrst deﬁne Qn(k)
as the probability that the kth record is broken after n
additional temperature observations, averaged over the
distribution for Tk. Using the deﬁnition of qn, we have

(7)

As we shall see, a surprising aspect of this distribution is
that it naturally leads to inﬁnite average waiting times.
To appreciate the implications of these formulae for
record statistics, we ﬁrst consider the warm-up exercise
of an exponential temperature distribution. For this case,
all calculations can be performed explicitly and the re-
sults provide intuition into the nature of record temper-
ature statistics. We then turn to the more realistic case
of the Gaussian temperature distribution.

While the expected time between records is well de-
ﬁned, the probability distribution for the waiting time
between records has an inﬁnite average value. Consider,
for illustration, the time between T0 and T1. By substi-
tuting Eqs. (8) and (10) into Eq. (7), the distribution for
this waiting time is

While we can express this integral exactly in terms of

To ﬁnd the asymptotic behavior of this integral, we note
that the integrand has a maximum at x∗ = k/2. Thus for
n > x∗, the exponential decay term controls the integral
and we may again estimate its value by taking the inte-
(ln n)k/n2. As
grand at the lower limit to give Qn(k)
a result of the power-law tail, the average waiting time
between any two consecutive records is inﬁnite.

∝

This divergence in the average waiting time ultimately
stems from the unbounded upper limit in the daily tem-
perature distribution. However, as mentioned previously,
there must be ﬁnite limits for the temperature because of
fundamental physical constraints that ultimately cut oﬀ
this divergence. Therefore the observationally meaning-
ful quantity is the expected value of the waiting time. We
thus focus on expected values to characterize the steps
between successive records depicted in Fig. 2.

The expected time to reach the kth record, tk, is simply

the sum of the times between records. Thus

observations, as expected from basic extreme statistics
considerations [17].

An important consequence of this theory that should
be amenable to observational test is the expected number
of record temperatures in a given year. After k record
temperatures for a given day have been set, the prob-
ability of another record is p>(Tk) = e−
T . Since

after t years should be 365

×
there should be 1.69 record temperatures for the year
2000, 126 years after the start of observations. Because
these numerical results are based on the unrealistic as-
sumption of an exponential temperature distribution for
each day, they should be viewed as qualitative sugges-
tions, rather than describing real data.

B. Gaussian Distribution

We now study record temperature statistics for the
more realistic case of a Gaussian daily temperature dis-
tribution. Again, to avoid the divergence caused the un-
physical inﬁnite limits in the Gaussian, we compute only
the expected value Tk of the kth record temperature, and
the expected time tk until this record. While the cal-
culational steps to obtain these quantities are identical
to those of the previous subsection, the details are more
complicated because the integrals for p< and p> must be
evaluated numerically or asymptotically.

As will become evident, the mean value in the Gaus-
sian merely sets the value of T0 and plays no further role
in successive record temperatures. Thus for the daily
temperature distribution, we use the canonical form

p(T ) =

√2πσ2

Again, the times between records is again independent of
σ; this independence arises because both the size of the
record and the magnitude of the jumps to surpass the
record are proportional to σ, so that its value cancels out
in the waiting times.

Next, we compute the asymptotic behavior for the dis-
tribution of waiting times between records. For sim-
plicity, we consider only the waiting time distribution
Qn(0) until the ﬁrst record. The distribution of waiting
times for subsequent records has the same asymptotic
tail as Qn(0), but also contains more complicated pre-
asymptotic factors. Substituting the Gaussian for p(T )
and the asymptotic form for p>(T ) into Eq. (7), and then

from corrections of

as in the exponential distribution! According to Eq. (30),
there should be 365/126
2.90 record temperatures per
year after 126 years. Records are thus slightly more likely
with a Gaussian temperature distribution than with an
exponential distribution. This increased propensity for
records stems from the decreasing size of the increments
between successive record temperatures. Although the
Gaussian this distribution has a faster asymptotic decay
than the exponential distribution, the decreasing sep-
aration between records means that they are easier to
achieve with the Gaussian distribution.

IV. MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS

To verify our theoretical derivations, Monte Carlo sim-
ulations were performed for both the exponential and
Gaussian temperature distributions. Our simulations
typically involve 105 realizations (days) over 1000 years
of observations, or until six record temperatures have
been achieved, whichever occurs ﬁrst. The initial tests
used a stationary mean and variance of 18◦C and 5◦C

respectively, which are typical values for the distribution
of maximum daily temperatures in the spring or fall in
Philadelphia. These values were chosen so that temper-
ature distributions have realistic ranges. However, the
numerical validation of theoretical distributions does not
depend on the particular values of mean and variance.

V. RECORD TEMPERATURE DATA

Between 1874–1999, a total of 1707 record highs (4.68
for each day on average) and 1343 record lows (3.68 for
each day) were set in Philadelphia. Because the temper-
ature was reported as an integer, a temperature equal-
ing a current record could represent a new record if the
measurement was more accurate. We also used the less
stringent deﬁnition that a new record either exceeds or
equals the current record. While the number of record
high and record low events over 126 years increased from
1707 to 2126 and from 1343 to 1793, respectively,, this
alternative deﬁnition does not qualitatively change the
statistical properties of record temperature events.

successive record temperatures. According to Eq. (25),
the kth record high (and record low) temperature should
be proportional to √2kσ2. Because the mean tempera-
ture for each day has already been subtracted oﬀ, here Tk
denotes the absolute value of the diﬀerence between the
kth record temperature and the zeroth record. To have
a statistically meaningful quantity, we compute Tk/σα
for each day of the year, and then average over the entire
year; here the subscript α = h, l denotes the daily disper-
sion for the high and low temperatures, respectively. As
shown in Fig. 4, the annual average for Tk/σα is consis-
tent with √k growth for both the record high and record
low temperature. Up to the 6th record, both data sets
are quite close, and where the data begin to diverge, the
number of days with more than 6 records is small—69
for high temperatures and 26 for low temperatures.

In summary, the data for the magnitude of temper-
ature jumps at each successive record, as well as the
frequency of record events and the distribution of times
between records are consistent with the theoretical pre-
dictions that are based on a Gaussian daily temperature
distribution with a stationary mean temperature.

VI. SYSTEMATICALLY CHANGING
TEMPERATURE

We now study how a systematically changing average
temperature aﬀects the evolution of record temperature
events. For global warming, we assume that the mean
temperature has a slow superimposed time dependence
vt, with v > 0 and where t is the time (in years) after
the initial observational year.

A. Exponential Distribution

Again, as a warm-up exercise, we ﬁrst consider the
idealized case of an exponential daily temperature distri-
bution,

p(T ; t) =

e−

(

(T

T < vt ,

(31)

where we set the characteristic temperature scale
to 1
for simplicity. In these units, both T and vt are dimen-
sionless. With this distribution, the recursion Eq. (3) for
successive record temperatures becomes

Solving this recursion successively starting from T0 = 1,
we ﬁnd Tk = k + 1, independent of v. Thus a systematic
temperature variation—either global warming or global
cooling—does not aﬀect the magnitude of the jumps in
successive record high temperatures. This was veriﬁed by
numerical simulations with an exponential distribution,
Pk(T ) for v = 0.012◦C/year
where the distributions of
and v = 0 match to within a few percent for k = 0 . . . 5.
On the other hand, a systematic temperature depen-
dence does aﬀect the time between records. Suppose that
the current record high temperature of Tk was set in year
tk. Then the exceedance probability at time tk + j is

temperatures should be indistinguishable from those in
a stationary climate, after which record temperatures
should occur at a constant rate. Since the average num-
ber of record high temperatures for a given day is 4.7
and the time until the next record high is very roughly

190 years, we are still far from the point
where global warming could have an unambiguous eﬀect
on the frequency of record high temperatures.

new record lows should continue to occur, as is observed.

atic temperature variation is superimposed on a Gaussian

The details of working out the eﬀects of a systematic

main results. We assume a slow systematic variation,

Next we determine the times between successive record

The crucial point is that the latter form for the ex-
ceedance probability has the same j dependence as in
the exponential distribution (Eq. (33)). Thus our argu-
ments for the role of global warming with an exponen-
tial daily temperature distribution continue to apply. In
particular, the time between successive records initially
grows as √4πk ek, but then asymptotically approaches
the constant value 1/v. As a result, the time before
global warming measurably inﬂuences the frequency of
record high and record low temperatures will be simi-
lar for both the exponential and Gaussian temperature
distributions.

Monte Carlo simulations were performed for the warm-
ing rates of v = 0.003, 0.006, and 0.012◦C/year, where
the middle case corresponds to the accepted rate of global

mean warming of 0.6◦C for the 20th century [14]. Unlike
the exponential distribution simulations, for the Gaus-
Pk(T ) is slightly diﬀerent in the cases
sian distribution
of no warming and warming (Fig. 3).
Fig. 5 shows the results of numerical simulations using
the Gaussian distribution with 105 realizations for the
three warming rates. For the stationary case (v = 0),
the probability of breaking a record after t years closely
follows the theoretical expectation of 1/(t+1). For warm-
ing, the rate of breaking a record high (Fig. 5, top) ul-
timately asymptotes to a constant frequency of approx-
imately 1.25v by 104 years. Given our crude calculation
following Eq. (34) that the time between records is 1/v,
the agreement between the observed rate of 1.25v and
our estimate of v is gratifying. As also predicted in our
theory, the probability of breaking a record low temper-
ature under global warming precipitously decays after a
few hundred years (Fig. 5, bottom); eventually record low
temperatures simply stop occurring in a warming world.

VII. DISCUSSION

Two prominent aspects of record temperature events
are the size of the temperature jump when a new record
occurs and the separation in years between successive
records on a given day. We computed the distribution
functions for these two properties by extreme statistics
reasoning. For a Gaussian daily temperature distribu-
tion, we found that: (i) the kth record high temperature
asymptotically grows as √k σ, where σ is the dispersion
in the daily temperature, and (ii) record events become
progressively less likely, with the expected time between
the kth and (k+1)st record growing as √k ek. It is impor-
tant to appreciate that this latter result is independent
of σ. Thus systematic changes in temperature variability
should not aﬀect the time between temperature records.
One corollary of our results for the time between record
temperatures is that the distribution of waiting times
between two successive records on a given day has an
inverse-square power-law tail, with a divergent average
waiting time. Another consequence is that the number
of record events in the nth year after the start of observa-
1. We believe that this latter feature
tions decays as n−
is a universal property of any temperature distribution
that decays exponentially or faster with temperature T
for T
. These theoretical predictions for the statis-
tics of record temperature events agree with data from
126 years of observations in Philadelphia.

→ ∞

Perhaps our most signiﬁcant result is that it is ex-

10

tremely diﬃcult to detect global warming by the fre-
quency of record-breaking temperatures with 126 years of
data. For example, after 100 years of observations, one
expects 365/100 = 3.65 record-breaking high tempera-
tures in a stationary climate, while our simulations give
4.74 record high temperatures in a climate that is warm-
ing at a rate of 0.6◦C/100 years. The actual data for
the frequency of record events is quite variable (Fig. 5),
so that the diﬀerence in record numbers is smaller than
statistical uncertainties. After 200 years, one expects
365/200 = 1.8 record-breaking high temperatures for the
stationary case and 3.4 for the warming case, still small
compared to the noise in the data. On the other hand,
it it important to point out that global warming does
aﬀect the frequency of extreme temperature events that
are deﬁned by exceeding a ﬁxed threshold [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
While the agreement between our theory and the data
for record temperature statistics is satisfying, there are
various facts that we have either glossed over or ignored.
These include the non-negligible diﬀerence between the
number of record high and record low events and the
propensity for record high temperatures to occur in the
early spring. The mechanisms for these two features lies
outside our theoretical description.

Finally, our analysis is based on the assumptions that
the appropriately scaled daily temperature has the same
distribution for each day and that temperatures are un-
correlated between successive days. The data is certainly
not consistent with the latter assumption. Instead, the
correlation between temperatures on two widely sepa-
rated days [13] decays as a power law in the separa-
tion, as seen previously in long-term temperature data
[19]. It seems feasible to adapt our theory to account for
this correlation by identifying the number of indepen-
dent “weather days” in each year through the time in-
tegral of the temperature correlation function. Another
basic caveat is that our theory applies in the asymptotic
limit, where each day has experienced a large number of
record temperatures over the observational history. The
fact that there are no more than 10 record events on any
single day means that we are far from the regime where
the asymptotic limit truly applies.

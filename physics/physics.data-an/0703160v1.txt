I. Frequency- and Phase-Resolved Signiﬁcance in Fourier Space

ABSTRACT

Institut f¨ur Astronomie, Universit¨at Wien, T¨urkenschanzstraße 17, 1180 Vienna, Austria, e-mail: reegen@astro.univie.ac.at

Context. Identifying frequencies with low signal-to-noise ratios in time series of stellar photometry and spectroscopy, and measuring
their amplitude ratios and peak widths accurately, are critical goals for asteroseismology. These are also challenges for time series
with gaps or whose data are not sampled at a constant rate, even with modern Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) software. Also the
False-Alarm Probability introduced by Lomb and Scargle is an approximation which becomes less reliable in time series with longer
data gaps.
Aims. A rigorous statistical treatment of how to determine the signiﬁcance of a peak in a DFT, called SS, is presented here.
SS is based on an analytical solution of the probability that a DFT peak of a given amplitude does not arise from white noise in
a non-equally spaced data set.
Methods. The underlying Probability Density Function (PDF) of the amplitude spectrum generated by white noise can be derived
explicitly if both frequency and phase are incorporated into the solution. In this paper, I deﬁne and evaluate an unbiased statistical
estimator, the “spectral signiﬁcance”, which depends on frequency, amplitude, and phase in the DFT, and which takes into account
the time-domain sampling.
Results. I also compare this estimator to results from other well established techniques and assess the advantages of SS, through
comparison of its analytical solutions to the results of extensive numerical calculations. According to those tests, SS obtains
as accurate frequency values as a least-squares ﬁt of sinusoids to data, and is less susceptible to aliasing than the Lomb-Scargle
Periodogram, other DFTs, and Phase Dispersion Minimisation (PDM). I demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of SS with a few examples
of ground- and space-based photometric data, illustratring how SS deals with the eﬀects of noise and time-domain sampling in
determining signiﬁcant frequencies.

1. Overview

2. Introduction

In this paper I provide a brief introduction to Fourier methods
in astronomical time series analysis (Section 2), outline existing
statistical approaches (Section 3), and address the major weak-
nesses in available techniques (Section 4).

While Sections 2 to 4 contain previously available (text-
book) information, I introduce a new and unbiased reliability
criterion (spectral signiﬁcance) based on theoretical statistics in
Section 5. This section also addresses the correspondence be-
tween the spectral signiﬁcance and other reliability estimators.
Section 6 is devoted to the comparison of the analytically de-
duced spectral signiﬁcance to the results of numerical simula-
tions. Finally, the results of comparative tests of spectral signif-
icance computation vs. other period detection methods are pre-
sented.

An example for the practical application of the new method
vs. a widely used standard procedure is provided in Section 7. It
may be useful for the non-mathematically oriented reader who
is mainly interested in how the technique performs in ‘real life’.

Further topics (Section 8) are the application of statistical
weights, the fact that a time series consists of individual subsets,
and potential problems with colored vs. white noise.

In Fourier Analysis a continuous function of time over a ﬁnite
time interval is expanded into a series of sine waves. These
waves represent a superposition of an oscillation at a fundamen-
tal frequency and a discrete, generally inﬁnite set of overtones.
The fundamental frequency is determined by the reciprocal time
interval width. All other frequencies correspond to integer mul-
tiples of this fundamental. The knowledge of the amplitudes and
phase angles for all frequency components permits one to en-
tirely recover the given function in the time domain.

Practical applications (such as astronomical observations)
generally deal with discrete sets of measurements (time series)
rather than continuous functions of time and, on the other hand,
consider the Fourier Spectrum as a continuous function of fre-
quency rather than a discrete dataset. This leads to the Discrete
Fourier Transform (DFT). It allows one to determine the domi-
nant frequencies of the observed physical process with a higher
frequency resolution than is possible with Fourier Analysis.

Motivated by the desire to understand physical oscillations,
the scientist is interested in a couple of eigenfrequencies and the
exact determination of related amplitudes and phases rather than
the complete signal recovery. In practical applications, these are
considered to correspond to local maxima (peaks) in the ampli-
tude spectrum. A widely held strategy is to

1. compute an amplitude spectrum for the given dataset,

2

P. Reegen: SS

2. identify the maximum amplitude within the frequency range

3. decide whether this amplitude is ‘signiﬁcant’,
4. subtract the corresponding sinusoidal signal from the time

of interest,

series, and

5. use the residuals after subtracting the ﬁt from the time series

for the next iteration.

This procedure is to be understood as a loop, terminated if the
maximum amplitude is not considered signiﬁcant any more. The
result of these consecutively performed prewhitenings is a list of
frequencies, amplitudes, and phase angles, plus a residual time
series (hopefully) representing the pure observational noise. In
fact, part of this noise is due to measurement errors, but fre-
quently merged with signal components the amplitudes of which
are too weak to be detected. As an example, the number of
photometrically resolved frequencies in the δ Sct star 4 CVn in-
creased from 5 to 34 between 1990 and 1999 (Breger et al. 1990,
1999).

In many cases, the results of the prewhitening are subject
to a multiperiodic least-squares ﬁt (e. g., Sperl 1998; Lenz &
Breger 2005). This represents a ﬁne tuning to adjust frequencies,
amplitudes, and phases to a minimum rms residual, but may lead
to the exclusion of some terms, or inclusion of new terms.

The eigenfrequencies, amplitudes, and phases of stellar os-
cillations provide fundamental information on the distribution of
mass and temperature, the radiative and convective energy trans-
port, or abundances of elements in the stellar atmosphere and
help to determine fundamental parameters such as mass, radius,
eﬀective temperature, rotational velocity, and age of a star.

3. Statistical aspects

In practical applications, a signal is not only of stellar origin but
a superposition of the information received from the star, instru-
mental (pseudo-)periodicities (e.g., invoked by thermal eﬀects),
and transparency variations in the Earth’s atmosphere. To elimi-
nate the third component, observations with instruments aboard
of spacecraft have been used increasingly by the astronomical
community during the past two decades. Unfortunately, stray
light scattered from the illuminated surface of the Earth intro-
duces additional quasi-periodic artifacts that are not easy to han-
dle and hence represent the major constraint to the accuracy of
space-based data acquisition (Reegen et al. 2006).

An unbiased criterion to decide, whether a peak amplitude is
generated by noise or represents an intrinsic variation, is impor-
tant, because the choice of the most signiﬁcant peak determines
all further iterations in the prewhitening sequence. A falsely
identiﬁed signal component usually perturbs all results obtained
subsequently.

In addition, Scargle (1982) points out that Gaussian noise
in the time domain may produce a peak of arbitrary amplitude
in the DFT spectrum. Since there is no natural upper limit to
amplitudes produced by noise, the danger of misinterpretation is
imminent, and the ‘signiﬁcance’ of an examined peak needs to
be described by a probability distribution.

Of course, the probability that white noise produces a low-
amplitude peak is higher than that for a high-amplitude peak. In
other words, the False-Alarm Probability that the highest peak
in an amplitude spectrum is an artifact due to noise is lower for
higher amplitudes. This deﬁnition is reasonable because it relies
on the highest available peak, since one cannot trust any peak,
if even the one with the highest amplitude is unreliable. In this
perspective, the False-Alarm Probability appears to be a good

criterion of whether to believe in the presence of a signal in a
given dataset.

The statistical description of the False-Alarm Probability re-
lies on a Probability Density Function (PDF), which is the con-
tinuous version of a histogram, as the bins of which become in-
ﬁnitesimally small. Thus the False-Alarm Probability is an in-
tegral over the PDF. In many statistical applications, probability
distributions may easily be described by the PDF, but an analytic
expression of the integral does not exist, as e. g. for the Gaussian
distribution. Hitherto many statistical problems are solved in
terms of PDFs rather than of the corresponding cumulative quan-
tities.

The PDF of the amplitude spectrum generated by pure
Gaussian noise at equidistant sampling was deduced by Schuster
(1898; also Scargle 1982). For non-equidistant sampling, the
Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (Lomb 1976) is claimed to provide a
better statistical behavior (Scargle 1982). Koen (1990) examined
the application of the Fisher test (1929) to the Lomb-Scargle
Periodogram to estimate peak signiﬁcance, and Schwarzenberg-
Czerny (1996) combined Lomb’s solution with the analysis of
variance method (Schwarzenberg-Czerny 1989) to obtain a pow-
erful period search technique for non-equidistant data.

A widespread, but purely empirical approach is the consid-
eration of a peak in the amplitude spectrum to be ‘real’, if its
amplitude signal-to-noise ratio exceeds a given limit. Breger et
al. (1993) suggest a value of 4. Numerical simulations for 19 300
synthetic time series by Kuschnig et al. (1997) return an associ-
ated False-Alarm Probability of 10−

3 for 1 000 data points.

An alternative way of determining periods was intro-
duced by Laﬂer & Kinman (1965) and statistically examined
by Stellingwerf (1978). The Phase Dispersion Minimization
method is based on the assumption that the correct period would
produce a phase diagram with the lowest intrinsic scatter. This
algorithm is a powerful tool especially for non-sinusoidal peri-
odicities, e. g., if the stellar surface structure is observed pho-
tometrically as the star rotates. In this situation, the advantage
compared to Fourier techniques is the simultaneous treatment of
all overtones that determine the shape of the signal.

In the case of multiperiodic variability, PDM loses accuracy,
since the phase diagram for one frequency is contaminated by
all others, unless they are integer multiples of this frequency.

4. Problems

A closer examination of the fundamental properties of the DFT
leads to the following issues:

1. The peak frequency in the amplitude spectrum of a single
sinusoidal signal is not recovered correctly (Kovacs 1980).
This is a side eﬀect of the restriction to a ﬁnite time inter-
val rather than a property of non-equidistant sampling. Also
the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram suﬀers from systematic peak
frequency displacements (see 6.2).

2. The ‘entire’ spectrum is deﬁned by the Nyquist (Critical)
Frequency as the upper limit for equidistantly sampled data
(Whittaker 1915; Nyquist 1928; Kotelnikov 1933; Shannon
1949; Press et al. 1992). In the case of non-equidistant sam-
pling, there is no unique deﬁnition of such a limit. Horne &
Baliunas (1986) suggest the average sampling interval width
for the calculation of the Nyquist Frequency; Scargle (1982)
and Press et al. (1992) promote the minimum sampling in-
terval; a variant discussed by Eyer & Bartholdi (1999) is to
pad the entire dataset with zeros to achieve equidistant, but
much denser sampling in the time domain and to take the

P. Reegen: SS

3

resulting sampling interval as a Nyquist Frequency estima-
tor. The most promising method was introduced by Sperl
(1998): each sampling interval of the non-equidistant se-
ries is considered responsible for its own, individual Nyquist
Frequency. In a subsequent step, a histogram of all individ-
ual Nyquist Frequencies helps to decide where to deﬁne a
healthy upper frequency limit.

3. Periodic gaps in the time-domain sampling introduce peri-
odicities in the Fourier Spectrum. In this case, a single si-
nusoidal signal is represented by a peak that is accompanied
by several aliases. In order to overcome the systematic ef-
fects of non-equidistant sampling in the frequency domain,
Ferraz-Mello (1981) examined the possibility of incorporat-
ing the sampling properties into the DFT amplitude spectrum
by introducing appropriate statistical weights. His study led
to the design of harmonic ﬁlters, which may help to improve
the selection of peaks. A diﬀerent approach is the consider-
ation of the entire ‘comb’ of aliases instead of the peak with
the highest amplitude only (Roberts, Lehar & Dreher 1987;
Foster 1995).

The goals of the present paper are

– to deduce the depedence of the Probability Density Function
of non-equidistantly sampled Gaussian noise on frequency
and phase (Section 5),

– to introduce spectral signiﬁcance as a measure of False-

– to compare the theoretical solution with the results of numer-

Alarm Probability (5.5),

ical simulations (6.1), and

– to quantitatively oppose the accuracy of the peak frequencies
using spectral signiﬁcance (6.2, 6.3) vs. the ‘simple’ DFT
amplitude, the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram, PDM, and the
DFT amplitude plus improvement of resulting peak frequen-
cies by least-squares ﬁtting.

A frequent problem in the context of astronomical observa-
tions is that all measurements do not necessarily have the same
variance. This may be due to diﬀerent instrumentation for dif-
ferent subsets of the time series or changing environmental con-
ditions, such as thermal noise or transparency variations in the
Earth’s atmosphere. Statistical weights are introduced into the
spectral signiﬁcance in order to take appropriate account of the
variable quality of measurements within a single dataset (8.1).

5. Amplitude PDF for non-equidistant sampling

This section presents the theoretical evaluation of the frequency-
domain PDF for a non-equidistantly sampled time series repre-
senting Gaussian noise.

A very important fact for the statistical analysis is, that in
most practical applications, the mean value of the observable is
shifted to a ﬁxed value (frequently zero) before the DFT is eval-
uated. The statistical description of frequency-domain noise has
to take this fact into account.

In statistical terms, the Fourier Coeﬃcients are regarded as
weighted sums of random variables. Such sums tend towards a
Gaussian distribution as datasets become large enough. Since the
Fourier Coeﬃcients for each frequency represent the Cartesian
components of the two-dimensional Fourier Space, the result-
ing Gaussian distribution will be two-dimensional (bivariate) as
well. Furthermore, as the Fourier Coeﬃcients are functions of
frequency, the considered Fourier-Space probability distribution
will depend on frequency, correspondingly.

Fig. 1. Schematic illustration of a time series with periodic
gaps representing Gaussian noise with a standard deviation
equal 1 (top) to visualize the dependency of the corresponding
frequency-domain noise on frequency and phase, as well as on
the characteristics of the time-domain sampling. In the two ex-
amples referred to in the lower panels, a test signal is displayed
(dashed lines) for which the DFT shall be evaluated. If the fre-
quency and phase are combined such that the data points con-
sistently align around the times when the trigonometric func-
tion attains a small value, only a small fraction of the time-
domain noise will be transformed into the frequency domain
(mid). For a combination of frequency and phase grouping the
data points around the maxima and minima of the test signal,
the time-domain noise will produce a higher frequency-domain
noise, correspondingly (bottom). The ﬁrst of these two cases pro-
duces a narrower probability distribution in Fourier Space, and
consequently, a signal with the same amplitude will be consid-
ered more reliable in the ﬁrst case than in the second.

For a time series with gaps1 (Fig. 1), the relevant inﬂuence of
the time-domain sampling on the frequency-domain probability
distribution is determined by the phase coverage of the measure-
ments: a combination of frequency and phase for which the inter-
vals containing data are consistently associated to angles where
the corresponding trigonometric function (‘test signal’) attains
low numerical values will result in a lower noise level than a
combination allocating the data close to angles where the max-
ima/minima of the test signal are located. The ﬁrst case will yield
a narrow probability distribution, the second case a broad one.
Consequently, a signal with the same amplitude has be consid-
ered more signiﬁcant in the ﬁrst case. These strong phase depen-
dencies are mitigated for frequencies providing a better phase
coverage.

Consequently, the amplitude distribution in Fourier Space
will have to be a function of both frequency and phase, which

is achieved by expressing the bivariate Gaussian PDF in polar
rather than Cartesian coordinates.

Coeﬃcients according to2

The probability of a peak generated by noise to reach a given
amplitude level may be evaluated through integration of the
PDF over amplitude, which leads to the Cumulative Distribution
Function (CDF) and False-Alarm Probability, based on which a
more informative quantity, the spectral signiﬁcance, is deﬁned.

5.1. Zero-mean correction

In astronomical applications, magnitudes are usually averaged
to a pre-deﬁned constant (zero or non-zero, as obtained by some
theoretical concept or calibration) before the amplitude spectrum
is evaluated. The following considerations apply to observables
adjusted to zero mean. If a non-zero constant is chosen instead,
the DFT will change, but the False-Alarm Probabilities will re-
main the same. In this case, one prefers to evaluate a DFT spec-
trum for the time series as it is but use a zero-mean corrected ver-
sion of the dataset for the computation of spectral signiﬁcances.
Considering a time series xk := x (tk) to be generated by a
Gaussian random process with expected value 0 and population
variance

, the time-domain PDF is

Due to the linearity of the Fourier Transform, the subtraction of
a constant in the time domain refers to a subtraction of a spectral
window in the frequency domain3.

Given a random process that produces an inﬁnite population of

dom variables xk is free to scatter around the population mean.

mean which is proportional to the inverse number of data points

If the ﬁnite sample is artiﬁcially adjusted to zero average, the
sample mean value is not allowed to scatter any more. Since the
standard error of an individual data point implicitly contains the
standard error of the mean, too, zero-mean correction will dis-
tort the PDF of the random variable. The only exception with
an invariant PDF is the Fourier Analysis, i. e., equidistant time-
domain sampling and a set of discrete frequencies.

An alternative (and promising) method in this context is the
Floating-Mean Periodogram (Cumming, Marcy & Butler 1999),
which is based on a least-squares ﬁt of a sinusoid plus a constant
to the time series, the latter retaining the free scatter of the sam-
ple mean.

Thanks to the Central Limit Theorem (de Moivre 1718;
Stuart & Ord 1994, pp. 310f), the consideration of these coef-
ﬁcients as Gaussian variables holds to a suﬃcient degree, even
if the time-domain noise is not Gaussian, because even short
datasets in astronomical applications are long enough compared
to the fast convergence of the PDF towards the Gaussian distri-
bution with an increasing number of random variables.

5.3. Frequency- and phase-dependent PDF

Since the DFT produces a two-dimensional vector (a, b), the
probability distribution in the frequency domain will also be
two-dimensional, so-called bivariate.

in publications dealing with the theoretical aspects of functional anal-
ysis, both Fourier Coeﬃcients and the inverse transform from the fre-

quency into the time domain are frequently normalized by K−
1. Also in the ﬁeld of communications engineering, diﬀerent nor-

factors is K−

to discrete frequencies associated to orthogonal DFTs, nothing will
change for non-zero frequencies in this special case.

The fact that the Fourier Coeﬃcients aZM, bZM of pure
noise are two linear combinations of the same random vector
in Fourier Space diminishes the degrees of freedom by 1. Hence
they may be considered independent to a suﬃcient degree, if the

5.5. Spectral signiﬁcance

The frequency- and phase-dependent False-Alarm Probability of
an amplitude level was introduced as the probability that ran-
dom noise in the time domain with the same rms error as the
given time series produces a peak in the DFT amplitude spec-
trum which is at least as high as the corresponding amplitude
level for the time series itself: if a peak is assigned a False-
Alarm Probability of 0.00 001, its risk of being due to noise
is 1 : 100 000. In this section, the spectral signiﬁcance4 as a
more informative quantity is introduced (5.5.1). It is the inverse
False-Alarm Probability (in this case, 100 000) scaled logarith-
mically. In the present example, the conversion of a False-Alarm
Probability of 0.00 001 into spectral signiﬁcance returns 5. In
this context, the spectral signiﬁcance is presented as a logarith-
mic measure for the number of cases in one out of which the
considered amplitude would be an artifact.

Plotting the spectral signiﬁcance vs. frequency yields the sig-
niﬁcance spectrum, and the identiﬁcation and consideration of
the highest peak in this spectrum may lead to a statement on
the signiﬁcance of the entire spectrum. The argument is similar
to many existing signiﬁcance estimates (e. g., Scargle 1982): if
the highest peak in the spectrum is below some limit, the entire
spectrum has to be considered insigniﬁcant. But instead of using
the (statistically biased) signal-to-noise ratio as a threshold, the
spectral signiﬁcance is employed. The application of the spec-
tral signiﬁcance concept to the highest peak out of a sample is
brieﬂy discussed (5.5.2).

The formal correspondence to traditional techniques, namely
signal-to-noise ratio and the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram, is of
special interest and hence provided subsequently (5.5.3, 5.5.4).

is useful for practical applications and will be employed for the
implementation of statistical weights (see 8.1). The subscript
‘ZM’ indicates zero-mean corrected time series data, in consis-
tency with eqs. 3, 4.

Thanks to the logarithmic scaling, the spectral signiﬁcance
appears as a product form (as opposed to an exponential func-
tion), where one factor (the bracket term) contains all informa-
tion on the ellipticity of the underlying PDF in Fourier Space
and is entirely determined by the time-domain sampling. This
term is scaled according to the squared amplitude. The serendip-
itous consequence of this separation is that the evaluation of
the bracket term applies to all datasets with the given sampling.
In a prewhitening cascade, the sampling of the time series will
not change. Consequently, the bracket term remains valid for
the entire sequence and has to be computed only once. In the
prewhitening cascade itself, it is suﬃcient to rescale the bracket
term by the squared amplitude, which speeds up the computa-
tions considerably.

Thanks to this formal separation, it is possible to pack all the
characteristics of the time-domain sampling into an amplitude-
independent function of frequency and phase. This will lead to
the Sock Diagram (5.6).

A further practical advantage of this separation is the oc-
currence of the population variance
independently of fre-
quency and phase. For small samples, the higher uncertainty of
the estimated population variance may be overcome by using the
and
sample variance
increasing the spectral signiﬁcance limit for peak acceptance ac-
cordingly.

eq. 10. Since the angle θ0 was chosen to refer to α0 as the semi-
minor axis of the rms error ellipse, α0 now corresponds to the
phase of maximum spectral signiﬁcance for a given frequency.

threshold as used in hypothesis testing.

One may desire to evaluate the spectral signiﬁcance for the high-
est out of a sample of peaks in the signiﬁcance spectrum – in
analogy to the procedure presented by Scargle (1982). His argu-
ments may be applied to the spectral signiﬁcance directly.

For a given spectral signiﬁcance level sig, the probability
of an amplitude level generated by a noise process to exceed
the spectral signiﬁcance limit sig is the False-Alarm Probability
ΦFA. It is linked to the spectral signiﬁcance via eq. 23. The com-
plementary probability that such an amplitude level is below sig

eﬀect has to be taken into account:

The spectral signiﬁcance is related to a peak generated by
noise with the same variance as the observable under considera-
tion, i. e. without prewhitening. Frequently, a signal-to-noise ra-
tio calculation relies on the rms residual, i. e. with the peak under
consideration prewhitened. Since (on average) a sinusoidal sig-
nal with amplitude A contributes A2

evaluates to

is suﬃciently accurate.

For an equidistant time series consisting of K data points,
the number of statistically independent DFT amplitudes is K
2 , if
K is an even number. One may set N := K
2 as a rough estimate
also for the non-equidistant case, which performs quite reliably
in practical applications.

For example, if a maximum spectral signiﬁcance threshold
of 5.46 shall be applied to a time series consisting of 1 000
data points, the corresponding ‘individual’ spectral signiﬁcance
threshold would be 2.76, which is in good agreement with the
numerical results by Kuschnig et al. (1997), who obtained a sig-
niﬁcance of

Fig. 2 shows the diﬀerence in spectral signiﬁcance for ampli-
tude noise with and without prewhitening as a function of time
series length. This diﬀerence increases dramatically as datasets
become shorter. When relying on signal-to-noise ratio estima-
tion, the issue of prewhitening is crucial and in some way philo-
sophical. If the considered peak is believed to be ‘true’ a priori,
then it will have to be prewhitened for the noise calculation. If
it is assumed to be an artifact, noise will have to be calculated
without prewhitening. However, the answer in terms of spectral
signiﬁcance is unique and clear: since the spectral signiﬁcance
analytically compares the considered time series with a random-
ized one, i. e. keeping the time-domain rms deviation the same,
the correspondence to a non-prewhitened signal-to-noise ratio
would be correct – if desired at all. The computation of the spec-
tral signiﬁcance allows one to completely omit the potentially
ambiguous computation of noise levels by averaging amplitude
over a frequency interval about a considered peak. In general, the
latter are not objective, since the resulting noise level depends on
the choice of the interval width and whether unresolved peaks
are encountered.

For classical DFT-based methods, the spectral window is fre-
quently used to determine the eﬀects of time series sampling in
the frequency domain. It is deﬁned as the DFT amplitude spec-
trum of a constant in the time domain, normalized to an ampli-
tude of 1 at zero frequency. In the case of non-equidistant sam-
pling, peaks in the amplitude window indicate periodicities in
the sampling of the time series corresponding to the frequencies
where these peaks occur. A frequently returned signature in the
spectral window of astronomical single-site measurements is a
1. This is the Fourier-
set of peaks at integer multiples of 1 d−
Space representation of periodic data gaps due to daylight and
termed ‘1 d−

1 aliasing’.

Since the spectral signiﬁcance is a more subtle and sensi-
tive quantity taking into account more information on the time-
domain sampling, it is possible to introduce a more sensitive
analogy to the spectral window, the Sock Diagram6. As with all
formalism in terms of spectral signiﬁcance, it is frequency- and
phase-resolved.

In analogy to the spectral window, the Sock Diagram rep-
resents the spectral signiﬁcance variations with frequency and
phase for a constant amplitude, or amplitude signal-to-noise ra-
tio. It provides quantitative information on the inﬂuence by the
time-domain sampling on the spectral signiﬁcance. Furthermore,
it displays the quality of signal-to-noise ratio-based estimation
for all possible frequencies and phases at a glance. Providing
both information on gaps in the sampling and frequency regions
with poor accuracy of the DFT amplitude, the Sock Diagram
shows where DFT-based signal-to-noise ratio estimation fails.

Since the orientation θ0 of the elliptical PDF in Fourier Space

to the position of the semi-minor axis of the rms error ellipse
to achieve better visibility: using θ
θ0 instead of θ provides a
constant alignment of the spectral signiﬁcance maxima in phase

of the astrophysical dimension, these observations have been
chosen as the primary test dataset, because they impressively
show all the characteristics typical for single-site measurements
that make multifrequency analysis a puzzling task.

The Sock Diagram uses three-dimensional polar coordi-
nates: for each frequency, the angular coordinate refers to phase,

number of time series data points. If the amplitude noise is cal-
culated after prewhitening, the spectral signiﬁcance associated
with a signal-to-noise ratio of 4 decreases below the equivalent
limit of 5.46 for short datasets.

and eq. 24 becomes fully compatible to the deﬁnition of the
Lomb-Scargle Periodogram5. In this context, the improvement
of the spectral signiﬁcance compared to the Lomb-Scargle
Periodogram is the correct statistical implementation of the ar-
tiﬁcially ﬁxed time series mean. Remembering that the initial
condition that led to the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram was a least-
squares solution (unfortunately without handling the zero-mean
correction appropriately), the signiﬁcance spectrum will satisfy
the corresponding least-squares condition for the zero-mean cor-
rected data as well. This is in perfect agreement with the results
of simulations, as presented in 6.2.

Since the Fourier-Space eﬀect of the zero-mean correc-
tion tends to vanish for inﬁnitely long time series, one would
expect the diﬀerence between the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram
and the spectral signiﬁcance to become small (or even negligi-
ble) for long datasets. The performance of DFT, Lomb-Scargle
Periodogram, and spectral signiﬁcance is compared for time se-
ries of diﬀerent length in 6.4.

On the other hand, the spectral signiﬁcance for the Floating-
Mean Periodogram (Cumming, Marcy & Butler 1999), the
statistic of which appears not to suﬀer from zero-mean correc-
tion problems, is directly obtained by using eq. 24 with α0, β0
and θ0 as given above (eqs. 36, 37, 38).

5.6. The Sock Diagram

In 5.5.1, the spectral signiﬁcance was introduced as a repre-
sentation of the statistical properties of time-domain sampling
in Fourier Space, applied to the amplitude spectrum of a given
observable (eq. 24). Selecting a single frequency and phase an-
gle, one ﬁnds the spectral signiﬁcance to be proportional to the
squared amplitude. This property makes it easy to determine an
analogy to the spectral window.

5 Lomb’s (1976) original publication deals with periodogram analy-
sis in terms of power. The expression of the present results in terms of
squared amplitude produces explicit consistency.

5.7. The marginaldistribution of phase angles

An alternative method to the computation of spectral signif-
icance as a function of amplitude and phase simultaneously
would be to use the phase information separately in addition
to, e. g., some traditional signal-to-noise ratio-based reliability
estimate. The idea is that for white noise in the time domain,
the Fourier phases are not uniformly distributed and that the ad-
ditional incorporation of the phase information may provide a
more detailed criterion on the reliability of a peak.

The overall distribution of phases at a given frequency is im-
mediately obtained by integrating the bivariate PDF (eq. 14) over
amplitude, which yields

6. Numerical tests

Two sets of numerical simulations have been performed, the ﬁrst
one to conﬁrm the agreement between the theoretically evaluated
spectral signiﬁcance and a straight-forward histogram analysis,
and the second one to quantitatively compare the accuracy of
frequencies returned by the various methods discussed in this
paper.

52◦ for the standard deviation obtained

In statistical terms, the phase distribution provided above is
a marginal distribution of the bivariate PDF given by eq. 14.
Instead of statistically examining a bivariate distribution, one
may use the two marginal distributions (in the present case, the
amplitude and phase distributions) instead, but encountering a
loss of accuracy, since correlations between the two random vari-
ables remain unresolved. Therefore, from the theoretical point
of view, it is advisable to use the bivariate form rather than the
marginal distributions. An additional problem is that there is
no analytical solution for the integral over phase, which would
transform the bivariate PDF into the marginal distribution of am-
plitudes. One would have to employ classical techniques relying
on the amplitude signal-to-noise ratio instead.

In addition to these theoretical objections to the examination
of marginal distributions, there is a major practical constraint:
Fig. 5 displays the expected values and standard deviations of
1, given the
Fourier phase for frequencies between 1.3 and 2.7 d−
sampling of IC 4996 # 89. In the considered frequency range, the
rms scatter of phases is greater than 44◦ for the entire frequency
range under consideration. Compared to the upper limit of 52◦,
this scatter will probably be much too high to reveal additional
information on the reliability of a peak, if the marginal distribu-
tion of phases is considered.

The PDF of phases provided by eq. 42 are in perfect agree-

ment to the results of numerical simulations.

5.8. Spectral signiﬁcance-based signal recovery

Practical applications are frequently based on a cascade of con-
secutive prewhitenings. In this case, the frequency at maximum
spectral signiﬁcance, ˆω, is considered as that of the strongest sig-
nal component, which is understood to be the next candidate for
prewhitening. The next step is to determine the best ﬁt for am-
plitude and phase at ˆω. The least-squares condition for the best
sinusoidal ﬁt at constant frequency ˆω is obtained by

6.1. Comparison of analytical and numerical solutions

Extensive numerical simulations have been performed in order
to examine the validity of the above theoretical considerations.
The simulations are set up in a way that compares closely to real
life. The algorithm to generate Gaussian noise is based on the
Central Limit Theorem (Stuart & Ord 1994, pp. 310f), providing
fast convergence of a mean value of uniformly distributed ran-
dom variables towards a Gaussian distribution with increasing
number of variables. All of the following numerical applications
rely on Gaussian noise produced by summing up 10 values from
the random number generator. A comprehensive compilation on
alternative methods to generate Gaussian noise is provided by
Firneis (1970).

An all-in-one simulation for many frequencies, many phases,
and many amplitudes would result
in tremendously time-
consuming computations. In order to keep the eﬀort reasonable,
only a single frequency is picked to examine the phase depen-
dency of the spectral signiﬁcance for diﬀerent amplitudes.

Fig. 6 displays the spectral signiﬁcance associated with an
amplitude signal-to-noise ratio of 4 – according to eq. 30 – for
the V data of IC 4996 # 89. The blue and red graphs represent
two orthogonal phases in Fourier Space. The comparison of nu-
merical and theoretical results is performed for a frequency of
1, where the deviation of spectral signiﬁcances from the
1.956 d−
expected value 5.46 is
5 for selected phase angles. Since it is
desired to examine the presence of spectral signiﬁcance varia-
tions with phase in numerical results where predicted by theory,
this frequency is a reasonable choice for a test.

≈

The procedure consists of ﬁve steps.

1. Zero-mean Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 1 is

imposed upon the IC 4996 # 89 sampling.

2. The zero-mean correction is performed to avoid scatter in the
mean of the ﬁnite time series about the population mean (see
5.1).

3. The Fourier-Space phase angle for the synthetic time series

at 1.956 d−

1 is evaluated.

4. The Fourier-Space noise is evaluated upon the variance of

the time series according to eq. B.11.

referred to by the vertical axis) for the V measurements of
1 as a function
IC 4996 # 89 at a constant frequency of 1.956 d−
of phase, referring to an amplitude signal-to-noise ratio of 1. The
solid line represents the theoretical result. A numerical simula-
tion for 1.5 million synthetic datasets (dots) – counted in phase
bins of width 1◦ – illustrates the excellent agreement. The sys-
tematically higher deviation of the numerical results from the
theoretical solutions at higher spectral signiﬁcances is due to
sample-size eﬀects: phase bins associated with a high theoret-
ical spectral signiﬁcance are hit less often than others. Hence the
total number of Fourier Amplitudes to be examined diﬀers from
phase bin to phase bin. The dashed line represents the expected
0.34 associated with a signal-to-noise
spectral signiﬁcance of
ratio of 1 for uniformly distributed arguments of all trigonomet-
ric functions.

≈

5. If the Fourier Amplitude exceeds the signal-to-noise ratio
under consideration, the resulting histogram is updated cor-
respondingly.

The number of amplitudes exceeding the preselected limit rela-
tive to the total number of synthetic datasets provides an estima-
tor for the False-Alarm Probability (and consequently spectral
signiﬁcance) associated with the chosen signal-to-noise ratio.

Figs. 7 to 9 display the agreement between theory and sim-
ulations for amplitude signal-to-noise ratios of 1, 2, and 3. The
corresponding numbers of synthetic datasets computed are 1.5
million, 22 million, and 250 million, correspondingly. In all
three cases, phase bins of width 1◦ were used for the histograms.
For a signal-to-noise ratio of 4, the number of synthetic datasets
required for an acceptable numerical accuracy would exceed the
capabilities of computational performance, especially those of
system random number sequences, by far.

Phases associated with a high spectral signiﬁcance occur less
frequently than others (see 5.7), whence the scatter of numerical
results is systematically higher at higher spectral signiﬁcance
levels due to sample-size eﬀects. Taking this into account, the
overall quality of ﬁts is good. In neither of the three plots, a
systematic deviation of the numerical results from the analyti-
cal functions is visible. However, the theoretical prediction for
the overall shape is recovered by the numerical results, indicat-
ing that the ellipticity given by the normalized axes α0 and β0

frequency interval.

A quantitative description of the quality of resulting frequen-
cies with and without noise was obtained by means of simula-
tions. For the sampling of the IC 4996 # 89 dataset (V), the fol-

For a signal without noise (top panel), the frequency ac-
curacies of the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram exceed that of the
DFT by a factor
10, and both proﬁles show accuracy varia-
tions with frequency. The Lomb-Scargle Periodogram does not
take into account zero-mean correction, as shown in 5.5.4. This
leads to systematic eﬀects not only for short datasets, but also
in frequency regions where the phase coverage becomes poor. In
the absence of noise, frequencies at maximum spectral signiﬁ-
cance are
100 000 times more accurate than the DFT results,
which is in the accuracy domain of the least-squares solutions.
Apparently the accuracy of the spectral signiﬁcance peaks is
only limited by the internal accuracy of the computer for double-
precision ﬂoating-point numbers. In addition, the accuracy of
spectral signiﬁcance is, in this respect, practically independent
of frequency.

≈

Once noise is added to the signal, the peak frequency ac-
curacy of spectral signiﬁcance becomes much poorer (in consis-
tency with O’Donoghue & Montgomery 1999), but as illustrated
by Fig. 10, the method does not get worse than either alterna-
tive procedure. The improvement of the frequency accuracy by
the spectral signiﬁcance solution for high signal-to-noise ratio is
valuable, since the exact knowledge of frequency provides exact

the consecutive comparison of Figs. 7 to 9 oﬀer convincing ev-
idence of the spectral signiﬁcance at a constant frequency and
phase angle to be proportional to the squared amplitude, as pre-
dicted by the theoretical solution.

prewhitening. Only exact prewhitening guarantees that weaker
frequency components are not contaminated by spurious residu-
als of the higher peaks.

6.3. Aliasing

One potential weakness of the DFT, which usually becomes puz-
zling in the analysis of non-equidistantly sampled time series,
is the susceptibility to aliasing. Whereas measurements over in-
ﬁnite time would lead to perfectly delta-shaped signal compo-
nents, the spectral window of ‘real’ data is convolved into this
1 side-
‘ideal’ spectrum. For typical single-site observations, 1 d−
lobes are visible around every signal peak, and in many cases it
is hard to decide which peak out of the ‘comb’ of aliases is the
right one. For multiperiodic signal, aliases of individual com-
ponents may interfere. If this interference leads to an ampliﬁca-
tion, an erroneous component identiﬁcation is inevitable, when
only relying on the highest amplitude. This applies to the spec-
tral signiﬁcance as well and reﬂects a major weakness of the
step-by-step prewhitening technique rather than the calculation
of the spectral signiﬁcance. Strategies to overcome the aliasing
problem have been examined for many years (e. g. Ferraz-Mello
1981; Roberts, Lehar & Dreher 1987; Foster 1995).

Fig. 11 displays a comparison of DFT, Lomb-Scargle
Periodogram, PDM, and spectral signiﬁcance in terms of frac-
tion of aliases among the 1 000 simulated test datasets used in
6.2. As in Fig. 10, the top panel refers to signal without noise,
and Gaussian noise of increasing standard deviation is added to-
wards the bottom panel. Not surprisingly, the susceptibility of
the DFT to aliasing does not improve, if a least-squares algo-
rithm is appended. The portion of aliases obtained using the
Lomb-Scargle Periodogram is fairly below that of the DFT.
Finally, the ﬁgure clearly shows that the spectral signiﬁcance
analysis is more stable against aliasing than either compared
strategy. Without noise, not a single alias peak occurs among
altogether 300 000 simulated datasets. For a signal-to-noise ra-
tio of 40, the percentage of alias peaks is less than a third of
the corresponding percentage of the alternative methods, even at
1. Only for the highest noise level, to which the bottom panel
1 d−
refers, all results are quite comparable.

Since the spectral signiﬁcance is not initially intended to
correct for aliasing, its capabilities to avoid potential misiden-
tiﬁcation of peaks are limited to the extent of spuriously am-
pliﬁed peaks by systematic inhomogeneities of the frequency-
domain noise. Simulations and practical experience show that
the systematic errors of spectral noise are an inferior error source
compared to the interference of aliases of diﬀerent signal com-

ponents. Presently investigations are performed to apply the
spectral signiﬁcance technique to simultaneous multi-frequency
solving algorithms for an improved treatment of aliases. The re-
sults are planned to be presented in paper II.

6.4. Samplesize effects

A further example is provided to compare the performance of
DFT, Lomb-Scargle Periodogram, and spectral signiﬁcance for
datasets of equal (or at least comparable) characteristics, but dif-
ferent length.

The ‘long’ dataset represents 34 nights (not consecutive,
but covering 81 d) of single-site photometry of the Delta Scuti
star 44 Tau (Strømgren y, 2 981 data points; Antoci et al. 2006)
acquired by the Vienna University Automatic Photoelectric
Telescope (APT; Strassmeier et al. 1997; Granzer et al. 2001).
More details on the data are provided in Section 7. The ‘short’
dataset is a subset of 7 consecutive nights (619 points). For
the subsequent investigations, only the sampling of these two
datasets is used. Peak frequency accuracies are computed ac-
cording to the procedure described in 6.2.

Fig. 12 shows the frequency accuracies of the compared
methods for the short dataset in the top panel. The display is ex-
actly according to Fig. 10. The bottom panel contains the iden-
tical analysis of frequency accuracies for the long dataset and
indicates an improved overall precision of the DFT and Lomb-
Scargle Periodogram, if the number of data increases.

However, 1 d−

1 aliasing persists also for the long time se-
ries (Fig. 13), which is compatible with the persisting alias peaks
1. Since the
in the spectral window at integer multiples of 1 d−
zero-mean correction is represented by the subtraction of a con-
stant from all observables in the entire time series (referring to
eqs. 3, 4), it is not surprising that the techniques which ignore
the statistical eﬀects of zero-mean correction retain these spec-
tral window-related weaknesses also in case of a large number
of data points.

The result of spectral signiﬁcance calculations is not pro-
vided in these graphs: the deviation of frequencies is practi-
cally equal to zero independently of frequency – as for the
IC 4996 # 89 data (top panel in Fig. 10).

Fig. 12. Frequency accuracy (rms scatter of resulting frequen-
cies about initial frequency for a single sinusoidal signal with
uniformly distributed phase) vs. signal frequency of DFT (or-
ange) and Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (green). The simulated
time series represent pure signal without noise at uniformly dis-
tributed phase angles. The top panel represents the frequency
accuracy for seven consecutive nights of single-site photometry
of 44 Tau (Strømgren y, 619 data points). These data are a subset
of the 81 days long time series presented in the bottom panel (34
nights, 2 981 data points). The plots illustrate the improvement
of the overall frequency accuracy of both methods for the longer
dataset. The corresponding deviations obtained using the spec-
tral signiﬁcance are practically zero, similar to the top panel in
Fig. 10, and thus not presented here. Only those attempts where

The formal concept of spectral signiﬁcance does not only
provide reliable information on the sampling characteristics in
the time domain, but also allows to include the computations
into a prewhitening sequence. SS realizes the entire
procedure as a high-performance algorithm. Implementations

The SS technique was applied to numerous datasets and
has proven its value also in other scientiﬁc problems. A practi-
cal example for a situation where SS performs superior to
classical DFT-based signal-to-noise ratio estimation is given in
Table 1. Columns 1 and 2 represent 13 identiﬁed eigenfrequen-
cies plus 16 excited linear combinations of the δ Sct star 44 Tau
(Antoci et al. 2006). The corresponding Strømgren v and y am-
plitudes as obtained from a multisite campaign in 2001/02 are
displayed in columns 3 and 4. The underlying light curves con-
sist of 3 890 points in v and 3 582 points in y. For the analysis of
the campaign data, the signal-to-noise ratio threshold for peak
acceptance was chosen to be 3.5.

The major part of the data (3 280 points in v, 2 981
points in y) was acquired by the Vienna University Automatic
Photoelectric Telescope (APT; Strassmeier et al. 1997; Granzer
et al. 2001). The data represent 34 nights covering a time inter-
val of 81 d. As a comparative test of the practical performance of
SS, the APT data alone were analysed using a DFT-based

of 4. Except for the higher threshold, this is exactly the same
technique as applied to the campaign data. In any case, the fre-
quencies found in the APT subset were cross-identiﬁed with the
frequencies published for the full dataset (Antoci et al. 2006).
The result for the APT data is displayed in columns 5 and 6. In
v, 20 of the 29 signal components are found, in y only 15. With

Columns 7 and 8 refer to the corresponding SS analysis
using a spectral signiﬁcance limit of 5.46 and reproducing all
frequencies except for one in v and 5 in y. The number of aliases
is 8 in v and 4 in y, but the majority of aliases in the SS result
occurs for frequencies not resolved by the alternative technique
at all.

8.1. Spectral signiﬁcance forstatisticallyweighted time

Astronomical measurements are generally inﬂuenced by instru-
mental and environmental conditions changing with time. Thus
diﬀerent accuracies for diﬀerent data points are involved, which
are frequently desired to be taken into account by applying
weights to the observables. If the accuracy is poor, the corre-
sponding weight is low, and high-accuracy data points are as-
signed a high weight, respectively. Furthermore, multisite cam-
paigns employ diﬀerent telescopes with diﬀerent instrumental
parameters, which may also require an appropriate weighting.

This section refers to a set of statistical weights, γk, k =

0, ... K

Weighting may be considered as counting an item ξk of, e. g.,
an arithmetic mean repeatedly instead of only once. If the num-
ber of counts for an arbitrary ξk is nk, then the arithmetic mean
over all ξk, k = 0, 1, ..., K

These parameters provide eq. 25 to return the weighted signiﬁ-
cance spectrum of the dataset.
In the case of γk =: 1

k, these relations consistently reduce
to eqs. 10, 17, 18 for unweighted analysis, respectively. Given
the above re-deﬁnitions, eq. 24 and the corresponding considera-
tions – conversion between signal-to-noise ratio and signﬁcance
(5.5.3) and Sock Diagram (5.6) – readily apply to weighted time
series as well.

These arguments may consistently be followed to obtain the sub-
sequent relations (eqs. 56 to 62).

The implementation of statistical weights has to be per-
formed for all elements of the spectral signiﬁcance relation
(eq. 24, or 25, respectively).

8.2. Spectral signiﬁcance forzero-mean corrected subsets

In some cases one may demand to correct the mean magnitude
for individual subsets instead of the entire time series, i. e. if the
data were obtained by diﬀerent instruments, or if the subtraction
of nightly averages is performed. In this case the inﬂuence on the

However, there is evident demand for further investigation
in the presence of colored noise. The statistical description of
colored noise and its implementation into the evaluation of the
spectral signiﬁcance is the subject of present and ongoing inves-
tigation and will be discussed in a dedicated publication (paper
III).

8.3. Colored noise
SS does not take into account colored noise. Since there
are both instrumental eﬀects (e. g. CCD readout, stability of the
spacecraft position) and stellar variations (e. g. low-amplitude
modes, granulation noise) to be considered and neither of these
two sources may be determined unambiguously, it is presently
impossible to deduce a reliable amplitude noise proﬁle for mea-
surements in many cases.

The heuristic approach to generate a noise spectrum by
means of (weighted) moving averages suﬀers from the presence
of unresolved peaks, which increases the risk to miss intrinsic
signal. Hence it is advisable to use SS for the detection of
signiﬁcant sinusoidal signals and to take eﬀects due to colored
noise (however the latter may have been determined) into ac-
count by choosing diﬀerent spectral signiﬁcance thresholds for
diﬀerent frequency regions.

SS exceeds the diagnostic capabilities of Discrete Fourier
Transform, Lomb-Scargle Periodogram, Phase Dispersion
Minimization, and least-squares ﬁts in various respects.

1. SS does not compare one peak amplitude to another.
Thus it avoids implications to the statistical independence
of peaks in the amplitude spectrum at a single prewhitening
stage and the ambiguity in deﬁning a Nyquist Frequency,
which all compared methods suﬀer from. The implicit
comparison of peaks by selecting the dominant one for
prewhitening may be performed free of the frequency and
phase dependencies of Fourier amplitudes, if the spectral sig-
niﬁcance is used instead (6.1). One remaining issue in this
context is the eﬀect of multiple hypothesis testing on step-
by-step identiﬁcation and prewhitening. The propagation of
uncertainties from one prewhitening step to another will be
a topic in Paper II examining the DFT on multi-periodic sig-
nals.

2. SS is based on an analytically straight determination of
the amplitude Probability Density Function (5.3). Provided
the noise is white (but not necessarily Gaussian), SS re-
turns exact results instead of signal-to-noise ratio estimates
(6.1). A more realistic approach is the introduction of col-
ored noise in the sense of serially correlated measurements.
Paper III is planned to discuss the appropriate incorporation
of the serial correlation into the spectral signiﬁcance compu-
tation.

3. SS is the ﬁrst technique in astronomical time series
analysis to use both frequency and phase angle in the compu-
tation of the False-Alarm Probability (Section 5), appropri-
ately encountering the fact that the amplitude noise level is
systematically diﬀerent for diﬀerent frequencies and phases
in Fourier Space (6.2). The statistics employed by SS
takes into account all available information provided by the
Discrete Fourier Transform.

4. The performance of SS for a single signal plus noise
is discussed in this paper (6.2, 6.3). For strong signal com-
ponents, the peak frequencies returned by SS are con-
siderably more accurate than the solutions of all compared
methods. For weak signal components, SS still provides
a slightly higher accuracy. Furthermore, there is indication
that the SS frequencies are at least as accurate as the
least-squares ﬁts. The systematic examination of multiperi-
odic signals and a comparison to non-linear least-squares ﬁts
will be provided in paper II.

5. Signal-to-noise ratio estimation provides a valid signiﬁcance
estimate, but becomes very poor for low frequencies and in
case of periodicities in the time-domain sampling (6.4).
6. Signal-to-noise ratio-based period detection is a matter of
experience and – to some extent – personal taste. SS
provides a solution that is completely free of subjective in-
ﬂuence. Interpretation is no longer a part of the analysis, and
the results remain exactly the same, if two diﬀerent persons
apply the calculations to the same data.

Tests on synthetic and real data conﬁrm that the SS analysis
is superior to signal-to-noise ratio estimates (Section 6).

The Sock Diagram (5.6), as a generalized analogy to the
spectral window, provides increased information on the proper-
ties of the time-domain sampling in Fourier Space, since incor-
porating phase-resolution as well. Periodicities in the sampling
of a time series are recovered by the spectral window and provide
a measure of the susceptibility of DFT to aliasing. In addition,
the Sock Diagram indicates frequency and phase regions with
high systematic errors of DFT amplitudes. Both error sources
may cause the classical signal-to-noise ratio estimation to fail.

The incorporation of statistical weights into the spectral sig-
niﬁcance calculation is provided (8.1), as well as the modiﬁca-
tion of the spectral signiﬁcance computation, if a time series is
assumed to consist of several zero-mean corrected subsets (8.2).
Both features also implemented in the present software version.
The SS software has proved its validity and excel-
lent performance in numerous practical applications, mainly in
connection with the data from the MOST satellite (Walker et
al. 2005; Guenther et al. 2005), but also for the photometric
search for new pre-main sequence Delta Scuti stars in young
open clusters (Zwintz et al. 2004; Zwintz & Weiss 2006). In ad-
dition, SS was successively employed for the photometric
and spectroscopic determination of the rotation periods of se-
lected roAp stars (Sachkov et al. 2004; Ryabchikova et al. 2005).
However, although the statistically unbiased approach used
by SS improves the reliability of results considerably, the
software does not provide an invitation to blind belief. It success-
fully separates the detection of formally signiﬁcant sinusoidal
signal components in a time series from their interpretation in a
physical context, nothing more. The practical application of the
program still requires a careful examination of results, namely
the decision whether a formally signiﬁcant frequency is related
to the observed physical process or an (e. g. instrumental) arti-
fact.

In this article we explore the multi-fractal properties of 1 minute traded volume of the equities
which compose the Dow Jones 30. We also evaluate the weights of linear and non-linear dependences
in the multi-fractal structure of the observable. Our results show that the multi-fractal nature of
traded volume comes essencially from the non-Gaussian form of the probability density functions
and from non-linear dependences.

INTRODUCTION

The intricate character of ﬁnancial markets has been one of the main motives for the physicists interest in the
study of their statistical and dynamical properties [1, 2]. Besides the asymptotic power-law behaviour for probability
density function for price ﬂuctuations, the return, and the long-lasting correlations in the absolute return, another
important statistical feature observed is the return multi-fractal nature [3]. This propriety has been important in the
establishment of analogies between price ﬂuctuations and ﬂuid turbulence [4] and the development of multiplicative
cascade models for return dynamics too [5].

Changes in the price of a certain equity are basically related transactions of that equity. So, the traded volume,
which is deﬁned as the number of stocks that change hands during some period of time, is an important observable
in the dynamics of ﬁnancial markets. This observation is conﬁrmed by an old proverb at Old Street that ”It takes
volume to make prices move” [6].

In previous works several proprieties of traded volume, V , either statistical or dynamical have been studied [7, 8, 9].
In this article, we present a study of the multi-fractal structure of 1-minute traded volume time series of the 30
equities which are used to compose the Dow Jones Industrial Average, DJ30. Our series run from the 1st of July until
the 31st December of 2004 with a length of around 50k elements each. The analysis is done using the Multi-Fractal
Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, MF-DFA 1
[10]. Besides the multi-fractral analysis we weight the inﬂuence of
correlation, asymptotic power-law distribution and non-linearities in the multi-fractality of traded volume. Since we
are dealing with intra-day series we have to be cautious with the well-known daily pattern which is often considered as
a lacklustre propriety[12]. To that, we have removed that intra-day pattern of the original time series and normalised
each element of the series by its mean value deﬁning the normalised traded volume, v (t) = V ′
hV ′(t)i, where V ′ (t) = V (t)

II. MULTI-FRACTALITY AND ITS COMPONENTS

A common signature of complexity in a system is the existence of (asymptotic) scale invariance in several typical
quantities. This scale invariance, self-aﬃnity for time series, can be associated to a single type of structure, charac-
terised by a single exponent, H (the Hurst exponent) or by a composition of several sub-sets, each one with a certain
local exponent, α, and all supported onto a main structue. The former is deﬁned as a mono-fractal and the latter as

1 To evaluate the local trends we have used 5th-order polynomials. From this order ahead, we have a nearly polynomial-order-independent

multi-fractal spectrum, contrarly to what happens with ﬁtting polynomials of smaller order.

companies. The legend on the right is also valid for the left. The ”original” and shuﬄed time series present a strong multi-
fractal character, while the shuﬄed plus phase randomised time series presents a narrow width in α related with the almost
linear dependence of τsh−ran (q) and also with the strong contribution of non-Gaussian PDF of traded volume to multi-fractality.

a multi-fractal. In this case the statistical proprieties of the various sub-sets are characterised by the local exponents
α are related with a fractal dimension f (α)[11] composing the multi-fractal spectrum. To evaluate, numerically, this
function we have applied the MF-DFA method [10]. For this procedure it was proved that the q-th order ﬂuctuation
function, Fq (s), presents scale behaviour Fq (s) ∼ sh(q). The correspondence between MF-DFA and the standard
formalism of multifractals is obtained by,

where τ (q) is the exponent of the generalised partition function. From Legendre transform, f (α) = q α − τ (q), we
can relate τ (q) with the H¨older exponent [11], α. Thus, using the previous equation we get

τ (q) = q h (q) − 1,

α = h (q) + q

f (α) = q [α − h (q)] + 1.

In ﬁg. 1(left) we display the f (α) spectrum (full line) obtained from averages for each q over the values of the 30
companies. In our analysis q runs from −20 to 19.5. We have veriﬁed that f (α) presents a wide range of exponents
from αmin = 0.32 ± 0.04 up to αmax = 1.09 ± 0.04, corresponding to a deep multi-fractal behaviour. For q = 2
we have obtained h (2) ≡ H = 0.71 ± 0.03 which agrees with strong persistence previously observed [7]. From our
time series we can deﬁne new and related ones that can help us to quantify which factors contribute the most to the
multi-fractal character of this observable. Among these factors we name: linear correlations, non-linear correlations
and power-law-like PDF. To that, we have shuﬄed the elements (within each time series) and from these series we
have computed hshuf (q). From these uncorrelated time series we have created another set by randomising the phase
in the Fourier space. Afterwards, we have applied the inverse Fourier transform to come back to the time variable.
These new series have Gaussian stationary distribution and scaling exponent hsh−ran (q).

In ﬁg. 1(left) we see that these two series also present multi-fractal spectrum, although the shuﬄe series has a
wider spectrum than the shuﬄed plus phase randomised series. Concerning the Hurst exponent, h(2) = H, we have
obtained H = 0.49 ± 0.03 for shuﬄed and H = 0.5 ± 0.03 for shuﬄed plus phase randomised series. Considering error
margins, these values are compatible with H = 1/2 of Brownian motion. Furthermore, we have made a set of only
phase randomised time series for which we have obtained H = 0.7 ± 0.03. From this values we have concluded that
correlations have a key role in the persistent character of traded volume time series.

Using Fq (s) scaling relation for the three series [10] and assuming that all the factors are independent, we can
quantify the inﬂuence of correlations, hcor (q) = h (q) − hshuf (q), the inﬂuence of a non-Gaussian PDF, hP DF (q) =
hshuf (q) − hsh−ran (q), and the weight of non-linearities, hsh−ran (q) ≡ hnlin (q) = h (q) − hcor (q) − hP DF (q). The
multi-fractality of a time series can be analysed by mens of the diﬀerence of values between h (qmax) and h (qmin),
hence

∆h = h (qmin) − h (qmax)

it is a suitable way to characterise multi-fractality. For a mono-fractal we have ∆h = 0, i.e., linear dependence of
τ (q) with q. In ﬁg. 1(right) we have depicted τ (q) for several time series from which we have computed the various
∆h. The results obtained are the following: ∆h = 0.675, ∆hcor = 0.027, ∆hP DF = 0.445, and ∆hnlin = 0.203. As
it can be easily concluded the inﬂuence of linear correlations in traded volume muli-fractal nature is minimal with
∆hcor corresponding to 4% of ∆h. This value is substancially smaller than the inﬂuence of ∆hnlin which corresponds
to 30% of ∆h. Our result is in perfect accordance with another previous result of us [9] where, using a non-extensive
generalised mutual information measure [13], we were able to show that non-linear dependences are not only stronger
but also more resilient than linear dependences (correlations) in traded volume time series. Last but not least, from
the values of ∆h we have veriﬁed that the main factor for the multi-fractality of traded volume time series is its
non-Gaussian, generalised q-Gamma [7, 8, 9], probability density function with a weight of 66% in ∆h. Moreover,
we have veriﬁed that the behaviour of τ (q) for q > 0 is quite diﬀerent from the q < 0, which is also visible in the
strong asymmetry of f (α). This could indicate that large and small ﬂuctuations appear due to diﬀerent dynamical
mechanisms. Such scenario is consistent with the super-statistical [14] approach recently presented [8, 9] and closely
related with the current non-extensive framework based on Tsallis entropy [15]. Within this context and bearing in
mind the relation 1/(1 − qsens) = 1/αmin − 1/αmax [16], we conjecture that, for traded volume, the sensivity to inicial
conditions may be described by ξ = [1 + (1 − qsens) λqsens t]

1−qsens with qsens = 0.55 ± 0.08.

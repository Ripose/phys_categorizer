An eﬃcient technique is introduced for model inference of complex nonlinear dynamical systems
driven by noise. The technique does not require extensive global optimization, provides optimal
compensation for noise-induced errors and is robust in a broad range of dynamical models. It is
applied to clinically measured blood pressure signal for the simultaneous inference of the strength,
directionality, and the noise intensities in the nonlinear interaction between the cardiac and respi-
ratory oscillations.

Most natural and man-made systems are inherently
noisy and nonlinear. This has led to the use of stochas-
tic nonlinear dynamical models for observed phenomena
across many scientiﬁc disciplines. Examples range from
lasers [1] and molecular motors [2], to epidemiology [3] ,
to coupled matter–radiation systems in astrophysics [4].
In this approach a complex system is characterized by
projecting it onto a speciﬁc dynamical model with pa-
rameters obtained from the measured time-series data.
In a great number of important problems the model is
not usually known exactly from “ﬁrst principles” and one
is faced with a rather broad range of possible parametric
models to consider. Furthermore, important “hidden”
features of a model such as coupling coeﬃcients between
the dynamical degrees of freedom can be very diﬃcult
to extract due to the intricate interplay between noise
and nonlinearity. These obstacles render the inference of
stochastic nonlinear dynamical models from experimen-
tal time series a formidable task, with no eﬃcient general
methods currently available for its solution.

Deterministic inference techniques [5] consistently fail
to yield accurate parameter estimates in the presence
of noise. The problem becomes even more complicated
when both measurement noise as well as intrinsic dynam-
ical noise are present [10]. Various numerical schemes
have been proposed recently to deal with diﬀerent aspects
of this inverse problem [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. A standard
approach is based on optimization of a certain cost func-
tion (a likelihood function) at the values of the model pa-
rameters that best reconstruct the measurements. It can
be further generalized using a Bayesian formulation of
the problem [8, 10]. Existing techniques usually employ
numerical Monte Carlo techniques for complex optimiza-
tion [11] or multidimensional integration [8] tasks. Infer-
ence results from noisy observations are shown to be very
sensitive to the speciﬁc choice of the likelihood function
[6]. Similarly, the correct choice of this function is one of
the central questions in the inference of continuous-time

noise-driven dynamical models considered here.

In this Letter, we present an eﬃcient technique of
Bayesian inference of nonlinear noise-driven dynamical
models from time-series data that avoids extensive nu-
merical optimization. It also guarantees optimum com-
pensation of noise-induced errors by invoking the like-
lihood function in the form of a path integral over the
random trajectories of the dynamical system. The ro-
bustness of our technique in a wide range of model pa-
rameters is veriﬁed using synthetic data from the stochas-
tic Lorenz system. We also present the reconstruction of
a nonlinear model of cardio-respiratory interaction from
experimentally measured blood pressure signal.

Let the trajectory x(t) of a certain N -dimensional dy-
namical system be observed at sequential time instants
t0, t1, . . . and a series Y = {(tk, yk); k = 0 : K} thus
be obtained. These measurements can be related to the
(unknown) system trajectory through some conditional
probability distribution function (PDF) po[Y|x(t)] giv-
ing the probability of observing a time series Y for a
speciﬁc system trajectory x(t).
If we assume that yk
has the same dimension as x(tk) and the measurement
errors yk − x(tk) are uncorrelated Gaussian random vari-
ables with mean zero and variance ǫ2, then we obtain
po (Y|X ) =

K
l=0 N [yl − x(tl), ǫl], where X = {x(tk)}.
Assume now that the underlying dynamical system is

Q

in fact nonlinear and stochastic, evolving according to

˙x(t) = f (x) + ξ(t),

(1)

where ξ(t) is an additive vector noise process. We param-
eterize this system in the following way. The nonlinear
vector ﬁeld f (x) is written in the form

f (x) = ˆU(x) c ≡ f (x; c),

(2)

where ˆU(x) is an N × M matrix of suitably chosen basis
functions {Unm(x); n = 1 : N, m = 1 : M }, and c is
an M -dimensional coeﬃcient vector. An important fea-
ture of (2) for our subsequent development is that, while
possibly highly nonlinear in x, f (x; c) is strictly linear in
c. Dynamical noise ξ(t) may also be parameterized. For

instance, if ξ(t) is stationary white and Gaussian
hξ(t) ξT (t′)i = ˆD δ(t − t′),

hξ(t)i = 0,

then the N × N (symmetric) noise covariance matrix ˆD
fully parameterizes the noise. The vector elements {cm}
and the matrix elements {Dnn′} together constitute a set
M = {c, ˆD} of unknown parameters to be inferred from
the measurements Y.

In the Bayesian model inference, two distinct PDFs are
ascribed to the set of unknown model parameters: the
prior ppr(M) and the posterior ppost(M|Y), respectively
representing our state of knowledge about M before and
after processing a block of data Y. The two PDFs are
related to each other via Bayes’ theorem:

ppost(M|Y) =

ℓ(Y|M) ppr(M)
ℓ(Y|M) ppr(M) dM

.

(4)

R

Here ℓ(Y|M), usually termed the likelihood, is the condi-
tional PDF of the measurements Y for a given choice M
of the dynamical model. In practice, (4) can be applied
iteratively using a sequence of data blocks Y, Y ′, etc. The
posterior computed from block Y serves as the prior for
the next block Y ′, etc. For a suﬃciently large number of
observations, ppost(M|Y, Y ′, . . .) is sharply peaked at a
certain most probable model M = M∗.

We specify a prior distribution ppr(M) that is Gaus-
sian with respect to elements of c and uniform with re-
spect to elements of ˆD. Thus, ppr(M) = N (c−cpr, ˆΣpr),
where the mean cpr and the covariance ˆΣpr respectively
encapsulate our knowledge and associated uncertainty
about the coeﬃcient vector c. We now write the ex-
pression for the likelihood in the form of a path integral
over the random trajectories of the system:
x(tf )

ℓ(Y|M) =

po(Y|X ) FM[x(t)] Dx(t),

(5)

Z

x(ti)

where we choose ti ≪ t0 < tK 6 tf so that ℓ does not
depend on the particular initial and ﬁnal states x(ti),
x(tf ). The form of the probability functional FM over the
system trajectory x(t) is determined by the properties of
the dynamical noise ξ(t) [13, 14].

In this Letter, we are focusing on the case of Gaussian
white noise, as indicated in (1), (3). We consider a uni-
form sampling scheme tk = t0 + hk, h ≡ (tK − t0)/K
and assume that for each trajectory component xn(t)
the measurement error ǫ is negligible compared with
the ﬂuctuations induced by the dynamical noise; that
is, ǫ2 ≪ h( ˆD2)n n. Consequently, we use po(Y|X ) →

FM[x(t)], the logarithm of the likelihood (5) takes the

With the use of (2), substitution of the prior ppr(M)
and the likelihood ℓ(Y|M) into (4) yields the posterior
ppost(M|Y) = const × exp[−S(M|Y)], where

The mean values of c and ˆD in the posterior distribu-
tion give the best estimates for the model parameters for
a given block of data Y of length K and provide a global
minimum to Sy(c, ˆD). We handle this optimization prob-
lem in the following way. Assume for the moment that c
is known in (7). Then the posterior distribution over ˆD
has a mean ˆD′
post = ˆΘy(c) that provides a minimum to
Sy(c, ˆD) with respect to ˆD = ˆDT . Its matrix elements

Alternatively, assume next that ˆD is known, and note
from (7) that in this case the posterior distribution over
c is Gaussian. Its covariance is given by ˆΞy( ˆD) and the

We repeat this two-step optimization procedure itera-
tively, starting from some prior values cpr and ˆΣpr. We
do not need a prior for D at this stage, according to
(8)-(11). At convergence we obtain the “true” mean pos-
post → ˆDpost. The

To continue the inference process with a new block
of data Y ′ of length K ′ we update the prior mean

3

cpr = cpost, ˆDpr = ˆDpost, and covariance, ˆΣpr = ˆΣpost,
and repeat the two-step optimization procedure. The
modiﬁcation is that updates now explicitly involve ˆDpr

We obtain (12) from (10) where the data record Y ∪
Y ′ of length K + K ′ is used instead of Y and the sum
over the ﬁrst K data points (block Y) is given by the
ˆDpr. Clearly, many non-overlapping, and not necessarily
contiguous, data blocks of varying lengths may be used
in this recursive model inference algorithm [15].

The terms involving tr ˆΦ(yk) in (6) originate from the
prefactor in FM[x(t)] (5) and do not vanish at the dy-
namical system attractors (1), unlike the terms in (6) in-
volving ˙yk − f (yk; c). Therefore both types of terms are
required to optimally balance the eﬀect of noise eﬀect in
{yk} (7) and provide the robust convergence.

We now consider an example of the dynamics in (1)

The parameters in (13) are σ = 10, r = 28, b = 8
3 .
We sample a system trajectory x(t) and produce a “data
record” {y(tk)} to be fed directly into the algorithm. As
an inferential framework, we introduce the following (bi-
linear) model of stochastic dynamics for x(t):

n, i, j = 1, 2, 3, where M = {{ani}, {bnij}, {Dnn′}} is the
vector of 18 unknown coeﬃcients. The form of the 12
basis functions Unm(x) is evident from (14). We were
able to infer the accurate values of c, ˆD for time step h
varying from 0.01 to 10−6 and noise intensities dn varying
from 0 to 102. An example of convergence of the coeﬃ-
cients is shown in Fig. 1. We found a step-wise decrease
in variances that occurs on a time scale of the period of
oscillations τosc ≈ 0.6 (dashed line in the ﬁgure). The
error of the inference is sensitive to the noise intensity,
total time T and the time step h. For example, for the
parameters of the curve 1 in the Fig. 1 the relative error
was 0.015%. The ratio T /h has to be increased at least
250 times to achieve error less then 1% when the noise
intensity is increased 104 times (curve 2 in the ﬁgure).

Finally, we apply our method to study the stochastic
nonlinear dynamics of complex physiological system. To
be speciﬁc we infer the strength, directionality and a de-
gree of randomness of the cardiorespiratory interaction
from the central venous blood pressure signal (record
24 of the MGH/MF Waveform Database available at
www.physionet.org). Such estimations provide valuable
diagnostic information about the responses of the au-
tonomous nervous system [16, 17]. However, it is inher-
ently diﬃcult to dissociate a speciﬁc response from the

rest of the cardiovascular interactions and the mechanical
properties of the cardiovascular system in the intact or-
ganism [18]. Therefore a number of numerical techniques
were introduced to address this problem using e.g. linear
approximations [19], or semi-quantitative estimations of
either the strength of some of the nonlinear terms [20]
or the directionality of coupling [21, 22]. But the prob-
lem remains wide open because of the complexity and
nonlinearity of the cardiovascular interactions. Our al-
gorithm provides an alternative eﬀective approach to the
solution of this problem. To demonstrate this we use a
combination of low- and high-pass Butterworth ﬁlters to
decompose the blood pressure signal into 2-dimensional
time series {s(tk) = (s0(tk), s1(tk)), tk = kh, k = 0 :
K} representing observations of mechanical cardiac and
respiratory degrees of freedom on a discrete time grid
with step h = 0.002 sec. We now introduce an auxil-
iary two-dimensional dynamical system whos trajectory
x(t) = (x0(t), x1(t)) is related to the observations {s(tk)}
as follows

xn(tk) = a1n

where n = 0, 1. The corresponding simpliﬁed model of
the nonlinear interaction between the cardiac and respi-

lations is shown in Fig. 2. Similar results are obtained
for the respiratory oscillations. In particular, the param-
eters of the nonlinear coupling and of the noise intensity
of the cardiac oscillations are b112 = 3.9, b122 = 0.62,
b132 = −13.4, and D22 = 4.75 (hξ2
y2 (t)i = D22). Consis-
tent with expectations, in all experiments the parameters
of the nonlinear coupling are two orders of magnitude
higher for the cardiac oscillations as compared to their
values for the respiratory oscillations reﬂecting the fact
that respiration strongly modulates cardiac oscillations,
while the opposite eﬀect of the cardiac oscillations on
respiration is weak. Remarkably, our technique infers si-
multaneously the strength, directionality of coupling and
the noise intensities in the cardiorespiratory interaction
directly from the non-invasively measured time series.

In conclusion, we have derived an eﬃcient technique
for recursive inference of dynamical model parameters
that does not require extensive numerical optimization
and provides optimum compensation for the dynamical
noise-induced errors. We veriﬁed the robustness of the
technique in a very broad range of parameters of dy-
namical models, using synthetic data from the chaotic
noise-driven Lorenz system. Successful application of the
technique to inference from real data of the nonlinear in-
teraction between the cardiac and respiratory oscillations
in the human cardiovascular system is particularly en-
couraging, as it opens up a new avenue for the Bayesian
inference of strongly nonlinear and noisy dynamical sys-
tems with limited ﬁrst-principles knowledge. Future ex-
tensions will include more realistic observation schemes
with “hidden” variables and ﬁnite measurement noise.

sponding to elements of c (given by ˆΣ−1). The rest of
the matrix elements of ˆΛ was zeroed out. This shortcut
does not change the algorithm preformance in the case
under study where the time step h is suﬃciently small
and elements of ˆD are typically inferred from fewer data
points as compared to the components of the vector c.

Abstract

We give a classical conﬁdence belt construction which uniﬁes the treat-
ment of upper conﬁdence limits for null results and two-sided conﬁdence inter-
vals for non-null results. The uniﬁed treatment solves a problem (apparently
not previously recognized) that the choice of upper limit or two-sided inter-
vals leads to intervals which are not conﬁdence intervals if the choice is based
on the data. We apply the construction to two related problems which have
recently been a battle-ground between classical and Bayesian statistics: Pois-
son processes with background, and Gaussian errors with a bounded physical
region. In contrast with the usual classical construction for upper limits, our
In contrast with some
construction avoids unphysical conﬁdence intervals.
popular Bayesian intervals, our intervals eliminate conservatism (frequentist
coverage greater than the stated conﬁdence) in the Gaussian case and reduce
it to a level dictated by discreteness in the Poisson case. We generalize the
method in order to apply it to analysis of experiments searching for neutrino
oscillations. We show that this technique both gives correct coverage and is
powerful, while other classical techniques that have been used by neutrino
oscillation search experiments fail one or both of these criteria.

I. INTRODUCTION

Classical conﬁdence intervals are the traditional way in which high energy physicists
report errors on results of experiments. Approximate methods, in particular the likelihood-
ratio method, are often used in order to reduce computation. When these approximations are
invalid, true conﬁdence intervals can be obtained using the original (deﬁning) construction
of Neyman [1]. In recent years, there has been considerable dissatisfaction with the usual
results of Neyman’s construction for upper conﬁdence limits, in particular when the result
is an unphysical (or empty set) interval. This dissatisfaction led the Particle Data Group
(PDG) [2] to describe procedures for Bayesian interval construction in the troublesome cases:
Poisson processes with background, and Gaussian errors with a bounded physical region.

In this paper, we use the freedom inherent in Neyman’s construction in a novel way
to obtain a uniﬁed set of classical conﬁdence intervals for setting upper limits and quoting
two-sided conﬁdence intervals. The new element is a particular choice of ordering, based on
likelihood ratios, which we substitute for more common choices in Neyman’s construction.
We then obtain conﬁdence intervals which are never unphysical or empty. Thus they remove
an original motivation for the adoption of Bayesian intervals by the PDG.

Moreover, we show below that commonly quoted conﬁdence intervals are wrong more
than allowed by the stated conﬁdence if (as is typical) one uses the experimental data to
decide whether to consult conﬁdence interval tables for upper limits or for central conﬁdence
intervals. In contrast, our uniﬁed set of conﬁdence intervals satisﬁes (by construction) the
classical criterion of frequentist coverage of the unknown true value. Thus the problem of
wrong conﬁdence intervals is also solved.

Our intervals also eﬀectively decouple the calculation of intervals from the test of
goodness-of-ﬁt, which is desirable but in fact not the case for traditional classical upper
limit calculations.

After developing the new intervals for the two prototypical 1-D problems, we generalize
them for use in the analysis of experiments searching for neutrino oscillations, continuing to
adhere to the Neyman construction.

In Sec. II, we review and contrast Bayesian and classical interval construction. In Sec. III,
we review the troublesome cases of Poisson processes with background and Gaussian errors
with a bounded physical region. We introduce the unifying ordering principle in Sec. IV,
and apply it to the previously discussed problems. In Sec. V, we generalize the method for
use in neutrino oscillation searches, and compare it to other classical methods. Finally, in
Sec. VI, we introduce an additional quantity helpful in describing experiments which observe
less background than expected. We conclude in Sec. VII.

We adopt the following notation: the subscript t on a parameter means the unknown
true value; the subscript 0 means a particular measured value obtained by an experiment.
Thus, for example, µ is a parameter whose true value µt is unknown; n0 is the particular
result of an experiment which measures the number of events n. For most of our discussion,
we use for illustration 90% C.L. conﬁdence intervals on a single parameter µ. The conﬁdence
level (C.L.) is more generally called α.

II. BAYESIAN AND CLASSICAL INTERVAL CONSTRUCTIONS

A. Bayesian Intervals

Although our approach is classical, it is worthwhile to review Bayesian intervals since
we ﬁnd that misconceptions about classical intervals can have their roots in misinterpreting
them as Bayesian intervals. For advocacy of Bayesian intervals in high energy physics, see,
for example, Refs. [3,4].

Suppose that we wish to make an inference about a parameter µ whose true value µt
is unknown. Assume that we do this by making a single measurement of an observable x
such that the probability density function (pdf) for obtaining the value x depends on the
unknown parameter µ in a known way: we call this pdf P (x
µ) [5]. (Note that x need not
|
be a measurement of µ, though that is often the case; x just needs to be some observable
whose pdf depends on µ.)

Now suppose that the single measurement of x yields the value x0. One substitutes this
µ), known as the likelihood function, which we denote

µ) to obtain P (x0

value of x into P (x
|

(x0

µ).

L

|

|

The Bayesian deems it sensible to speak of pdf’s for the unknown µt; these pdf’s represent
degree of belief about µt. One makes inferences using the “posterior” pdf, which is the
x0) for the unknown µt, given the result x0 of the measurement. It is
conditional pdf P (µt|
by applying Bayes’s Theorem. Bayes’s Theorem in classical probability says that
related to
L
the probability that an element is in both sets A and B is P (A

Bayesians apply this to pdf’s for µt, obtaining

B) P (B) = P (B

|

P (µt|

x0) =

(x0

µt) P (µt)/P (x0).

L

|

Typically the denominator is just a normalization constant, so the major issue is what to
use for P (µt), which is called the “prior” pdf. For the moment we assume that one has the
prior pdf, so that then one has the posterior pdf.

A Bayesian interval [µ1, µ2] corresponding to a conﬁdence level α can be constructed

from the posterior pdf by requiring

(2.1)

(2.2)

µ2

µ1

Z

P (µt|

x0)dµt = α.

These intervals are more properly called “ credible intervals”, although “Bayesian conﬁdence
intervals” is also used [6]. Note that there is freedom in the choice of µ1 depending on whether
one desires an upper limit, lower limit, central interval, etc.

We believe that for making decisions, this Bayesian description of inference is probably
how many scientists do (and should) think, and that the prior pdf one uses is typically the
subjective prior. One person’s subjective prior incorporates all of that person’s personal
beliefs as well as the results of previous experiments. Thus, values of µ which contradict
well-founded theoretical thinking are (properly) given a low prior [7].

There have been long-standing attempts to take the subjectivity out of the prior pdf, in
order to have an “objective” Bayesian interval. One attempts to deﬁne a prior pdf which
represents prior ignorance, or which is “non-informative”. The naive choice of uniform prior
is not well-deﬁned for a continuous variable, since one must specify in what metric the
prior is uniform; this is just as hard as specifying the functional form in a particular given
metric. For a parameter µ which is restricted to [0,
], a common non-informative prior

in the statistics literature [8,9] is P (µt) = 1/µt, which corresponds to a uniform prior for
ln µt. An alternative [10,11] for the Poisson mean is P (µt) = 1/√µt. In contrast, the PDG
recommendation is equivalent to using a prior which is uniform in µt. This recommendation
has no basis that we know of in Bayesian theory. It is based on the desire to have intervals
which are conservative (see below) and somewhat robust from a frequentist (anti-Bayesian)
point of view.

In our view, the attempt to ﬁnd a non-informative prior within Bayesian inference is
misguided. The real power of Bayesian inference lies in its ability to incorporate “informa-
tive” prior information, not “ignorance”. The interpretation of Bayesian intervals based on
uniform priors is vague at best, since they may bear no relation either to subjective Bayesian
intervals of a typical scientist, or to classical conﬁdence intervals which are probability state-
ments based only on P (x
|

µ).

B. Classical Conﬁdence Intervals

Neyman’s original “conﬁdence intervals” [1] completely avoid the concept of pdf’s in µt,
and hence have no troublesome prior. They are limited to statements derived from P (x
µ);
|
in our experience this can lead to misinterpretations by those who mistakenly take them
x0). We believe that, compared to Bayesian intervals with an
to be statements about P (µt|
“objective prior”, conﬁdence intervals provide the preferred option for publishing numerical
results of an experiment in an objective way. However, it is critical not to interpret them as
x0). Rather, a conﬁdence interval [µ1, µ2]
Bayesian intervals, i.e., as statements about P (µt|
is a member of a set, such that the set has the property that

P (µ

[µ1, µ2]) = α.

∈

(2.3)

Here µ1 and µ2 are functions of the measured x, and Eq. 2.3 refers to the varying conﬁdence
intervals [µ1, µ2] from an ensemble of experiments with ﬁxed µ. For a set of conﬁdence
intervals, Eq. 2.3 is true for every allowed µ. Thus, in particular, the intervals contain the
ﬁxed unknown µt in a fraction α of experiments. This is entirely diﬀerent from the Bayesian
statement that the degree of belief that µt is in [µ1, µ2] is α.

If Eq. (2.3) is satisﬁed, then one says that the intervals “cover” µ at the stated conﬁdence,
or equivalently, that the set of intervals has the correct “coverage”. If there is any value of
µ for which P (µ
[µ1, µ2]) < α, then we say that the intervals “undercover” for that µ.
Signiﬁcant undercoverage for any µ is a serious ﬂaw. If there is any value of µ for which
[µ1, µ2]) > α, then we say that the intervals “overcover” for that µ. A set of intervals
P (µ
is called “conservative” if it overcovers for some values of µ while undercovering for no values
of µ. Conservatism, while not generally considered to be as serious a ﬂaw as undercoverage,
comes with a price: loss of power in rejecting false hypotheses.

Our conﬁdence intervals require the full power of Neyman’s construction, which for one
measured quantity and one unknown parameter is called the method of “conﬁdence belts”
[10,12]. Figure 1 illustrates such a construction on a graph of the parameter µ vs. the
µ) along the horizontal line
measured quantity x. For each value of µ, one examines P (x

through µ. One selects an interval [x1, x2] which is a subset of this line such that

(2.4)

Such intervals are drawn as horizontal line segments on Fig. 1, at representative values of
µ. We refer to the interval [x1, x2] as the “acceptance region” or the “acceptance interval”
for that µ. In order to specify uniquely the acceptance region, one must choose auxiliary
criteria. One has total freedom to make this choice, if the choice is not inﬂuenced by the
data x0. The most common choices are:

which leads to “upper conﬁdence limits” (which satisfy P (µ > µ2) = 1

which leads to “central conﬁdence intervals” (which satisfy P (µ < µ1) = P (µ > µ2) =

a simpler explanation suﬃces when one speciﬁes P (x < x1
For more complicated choices which still satisfy the more general speciﬁcation of Eq. (2.4),
an ordering principle is needed to specify which x’s to include in the acceptance region. We
give our ordering principle in Sec. IV.

|

|

The construction is complete when horizontal acceptance intervals are drawn for each
value of µ. Upon performing an experiment to measure x and obtaining the value x0, one
draws a vertical line (shown dashed in Fig. 1) through x0 on the horizontal axis. The
conﬁdence interval is the union of all values of µ for which the corresponding horizontal
interval is intercepted by the vertical line; typically this is a simply connected interval
[µ1, µ2]. When displayed in texts, typically only the endpoints of the intervals are drawn,
which collectively form the “conﬁdence belt”.

By construction, Eq. (2.3) is satisﬁed for all µ; Hence it is satisﬁed for µt, whose value

is ﬁxed but unknown.

III. EXAMPLES OF CLASSICAL INTERVALS

A. Gaussian with Boundary at Origin

Figures 2 and 3 show standard conﬁdence belts (for upper limits and central intervals,
respectively) when the observable x is simply the measured value of µ in an experiment with
a Gaussian resolution function with known ﬁxed rms deviation σ, set here to unity. I.e.,

µ) =

P (x
|

1
√2π

exp(

(x

−

−

µ)2/2).

(3.1)

We consider the interesting case where only non-negative values for µ are physically allowed
(for example, if µ is a mass). Thus, the graph does not exist for µ < 0.

Although these are standard graphs, we believe that common use of them is not en-
tirely proper. Fig. 2, constructed using Eq. 2.5, is appropriate for experiments when it
is determined before performing the experiment that an upper limit will be published. Fig.
3, constructed using Eq. 2.6, is appropriate for experiments when it is determined before
performing the experiment that a central conﬁdence interval will be published. However, it

5

may be deemed more sensible to decide, based on the results of the experiment, whether to
publish an upper limit or a central conﬁdence interval.

Let us suppose, for example, that Physicist X takes the following attitude in an experi-
ment designed to measure a small quantity: “If the result x is less then 3σ, I will state an
upper limit from the standard tables. If the result is greater than 3σ, I will state a central
conﬁdence interval from the standard tables.” We call this policy “ﬂip-ﬂopping” based on
the data. Furthermore, Physicist X may say, “If my measured value of a physically positive
quantity is negative, I will pretend that I measured zero when quoting a conﬁdence interval”,
which introduces some conservatism.

We can examine the eﬀect of such a ﬂip-ﬂopping policy by displaying it in conﬁdence-
belt form as shown in Fig. 4. For each value of measured x, we draw at that x the vertical
segment [µ1, µ2] that Physicist X will quote as a conﬁdence interval. Then we can examine
this collection of vertical conﬁdence intervals to see what horizontal acceptance intervals it
implies. For example, for µ = 2.0, the acceptance interval has x1 = 2
1.28 and x2 = 2+1.64.
µ). Thus Eq. (2.4) is not satisﬁed.
This interval only contains 85% of the probability P (x
|
Physicists X’s intervals undercover for a signiﬁcant range of µ: they are not conﬁdence
intervals or conservative conﬁdence intervals.

−

Both Figs. 2 and 3 are conﬁdence intervals when used appropriately, i.e., without ﬂip-
ﬂopping. However, the result is unsatisfying when one measures, for example, x =
1.8.
In that case, one draws the vertical line as directed and ﬁnds that the conﬁdence interval
is the empty set! (An alternative way of expressing this situation is to allow non-physical
µ’s when constructing the conﬁdence belt, and then to say that the conﬁdence interval is
entirely in the non-physical region. This requires knowing P (x
µ) for non-physical µ, which
|
can raise conceptual diﬃculties.) When this situation arises, one knows that one is in the
“wrong” 10% of the ensemble quoting 90% C.L. intervals. One can go ahead and quote the
wrong result, and the ensemble of intervals will have the proper coverage. But this is not
very comforting.

−

Both problems of the previous two paragraphs are solved by the ordering principle which

we give in Sec. IV.

B. Poisson with Background

Figures 5 and 6 show standard [13,14] conﬁdence belts for a Poisson process when the
observable x is the total number of observed events n, consisting of signal events with mean
µ and background events with known mean b. I.e.,

P (n
|

µ) = (µ + b)n exp(

(µ + b))/n!

−

(3.2)

In these ﬁgures, we use for illustration the case where b = 3.0.

Since n is an integer, Eq. (2.3) can only be approximately satisﬁed. By convention dating
to the 1930’s, one strictly avoids undercoverage and replaces the equality in Eq. (2.3) with
“

”. Thus the intervals overcover, and are conservative.
Although the word “conservative” in this context may be viewed by some as desirable,
in fact it is an undesirable property of a set of conﬁdence intervals. Ideal intervals cover
the unknown true value at exactly the stated conﬁdence: 90% C.L. intervals should fail to

≥

6

contain the true value 10% of the time. If one desires intervals which cover more than 90%
of the time, the solution is not to add conservatism to the intervals, but rather to choose a
higher conﬁdence level. The discreteness of n in the Poisson problem leads unavoidably to
some conservatism, but this is unfortunate, not a virtue.

The Poisson intervals in Figs. 5 and 6 suﬀer from the same problems as the Gaussian
intervals. First, if Physicist X uses the data to decide whether to use Fig. 5 or Fig. 6,
then the resulting hybrid set can undercover. Second, there is a well-known problem if, for
example, b = 3.0 and no events are observed. In that case, the conﬁdence interval is again
the empty set. These problems are solved by the ordering principle given in Sec. IV.

For this Poisson case, there is an alternative set of intervals, given by Crow and Gardner
[15], which is instructive because it requires the full Neyman construction. In constructing
these intervals, one minimizes the horizontal length of the acceptance region [n1, n2] at each
value of µ. Since n is a discrete variable, the concept of length in the horizontal direction
can be well-deﬁned as the number of discrete points. Said another way, the points in the
µ), until the until the
acceptance interval at each µ are chosen in order of decreasing P (n

µ) meets or exceeds the desired C.L. (There are other technical details in the
|
original paper.) The Crow-Gardner intervals are instructive because neither Eq. (2.5) nor
Eq. (2.6) is satisﬁed, even as a conservative inequality. (Recall that x is identiﬁed with n in
this section.) For α = 0.9, P (n < n1
µ)
varies between 0.011 and 0.078, in a manner dictated by the Neyman construction so that
always P (n

but with a diﬀerent ordering for choosing the points in the acceptance interval.

IV. NEW INTERVALS FROM AN ORDERING PRINCIPLE BASED ON
LIKELIHOOD RATIOS

A. Poisson with Background

We begin with a numerical example which occurs in the construction of conﬁdence belts
for a Poisson process with background. The construction proceeds in the manner of Fig. 1,
where the measurement x in Fig. 1 now corresponds to the measured total number of events
n.

Let the known mean background be b = 3.0, and consider the construction of the hori-
µ) is given by Eq. (3.2), and

zontal acceptance interval at signal mean µ = 0.5. Then P (n
|
is given in second column of Table I.

Now consider, for example, n = 0. For the assumed b = 3., the probability of obtaining
0 events is 0.03 if µ = 0.5, which is quite low on an absolute scale. However, it is not so
low when compared to the probability (0.05) of obtaining 0 events with b = 3. and µ = 0.0,
which is the alternate hypothesis with the greatest likelihood. A ratio of likelihoods, in this
case 0.03/0.05, is what we use as our ordering principle when selecting those values of n to
place in the acceptance interval.

That is, for each n, we let µbest be that value of mean signal µ which maximizes P (n

we require µbest to be physically allowed, i.e., non-negative in this case. Then µbest =
max(0, n
µbest),
which is given in the fourth column. The ﬁfth column contains the ratio,

b), and is given in the third column of Table I. We then compute P (n

R = P (n

(4.1)

and is the quantity on which our ordering principle is based. R is a ratio of two likelihoods:
the likelihood of obtaining n given the actual mean µ, and the likelihood of obtaining n
given the best-ﬁt physically allowed mean. Values of n are added to the acceptance region
for a given µ in decreasing order of R, until the sum of P (n
µ) meets or exceeds the desired
|
C.L. This ordering, for values of n necessary to obtain total probability of 90%, is shown
in the column labeled “rank”. Thus, the acceptance region for µ = 0.5 (analogous to a
horizontal line segment in Figure 1), is the interval n = [0, 6]. Due to the discreteness of n,
the acceptance region contains more summed probability than 90%; this is unavoidable no
matter what the ordering principle, and leads to conﬁdence intervals which are conservative.
For comparison, in the column of Table I labeled “U.L.”, we place check marks at the
values of n which are in the acceptance region of standard 90% C.L. upper limits for this
example; and in the column labeled “central”, we place check marks at the values of n which
are in the acceptance region of standard 90% C.L central conﬁdence intervals.

The construction proceeds by ﬁnding the acceptance region for all values of µ, for the
given value of b. With a computer, we perform the construction on a grid of discrete values
of µ, in the interval [0, 50] in steps of 0.005. This suﬃces for the precision desired (0.01) in
endpoints of conﬁdence intervals. We ﬁnd that a mild pathology arises as a result of the
fact that the observable n is discrete. When the vertical dashed line is drawn at some n0 (in
analogy with in Fig. 1), it can happen that the set of intersected horizontal line segments is
not simply connected. When this occurs we naturally take the conﬁdence interval to have
µ1 corresponding to the bottom-most segment intersected, and to have µ2 corresponding to
the top-most segment intersected.

We then repeat the construction for a selection of ﬁxed values of b. We ﬁnd an additional
mild pathology, again caused by the discreteness in n: when we compare the results for
diﬀerent values of b for ﬁxed n0, the upper endpoint µ2 is not always a decreasing function
of b, as would be expected. When this happens, we force the function to be non-increasing,
by lengthening selected conﬁdence intervals as necessary. We have investigated this behavior,
and compensated for it, over a ﬁne grid of b in the range [0, 25] in increments of 0.001 (with
some additional searching to even ﬁner precision).

Our compensation for the two pathologies mentioned in the previous paragraphs adds
slightly to our intervals’ conservatism, which however remains dominated by the unavoidable
eﬀects due to the discreteness in n.

The conﬁdence belts resulting from our construction are shown in Fig. 7, which may
be compared with Figs. 5 and 6. At large n, Fig. 7 is similar to Fig. 6; the background
is eﬀectively subtracted without constraint, and our ordering principle produces two-sided
intervals which are approximately central intervals. At small n, the conﬁdence intervals from
Fig. 7 automatically become upper limits on µ; i.e., the lower endpoint µ1 is 0 for n
4
in this case. Thus, ﬂip-ﬂopping between Figs. 5 and 6 is replaced by one coherent set of
conﬁdence intervals, (and no interval is the empty set).

≤

Tables II-IX give our conﬁdence intervals [µ1, µ2] for the signal mean µ for the most
commonly used conﬁdence levels, namely 68.27% (sometimes called 1-σ intervals by analogy
with Gaussian intervals), 90%, 95%, and 99%. Values in italics indicate results which must
be taken with particular caution, since the probability of obtaining the number of events
observed or fewer is less than 1%, even if µ = 0. (See Sec. IV C below.)

8

Figure 8 shows, for n = 0 through n = 10, the value of µ2 as a function of b, for
90% C.L. The small horizontal sections in the curves are the result of the mild pathology
mentioned above, in which the original curves make a small dip, which we have eliminated.
Dashed portions in the lower right indicate results which must be taken with particular
caution, corresponding to the italicized values in the tables. Dotted portions on the upper
left indicate regions where µ1 is non-zero. These corresponding values of µ1 are shown in
Fig. 9.

Figure 8 can be compared with the Bayesian calculation in Fig. 28.8 of Ref. [2] which
uses a uniform prior for µt. A noticeable diﬀerence is that our curve for n = 0 decreases
as a function of b, while the result of the Bayesian calculation stays constant (at 2.3). The
µ) decreases as b increases. We ﬁnd

B. Gaussian with Boundary at Origin

It is straightforward to apply our ordering principle to the other troublesome example
of Sec. III, the case of a Gaussian resolution function (Eq. 3.1) for µ, when µ is physically

During our Neyman construction of conﬁdence intervals, R determines the order in which
values of x are added to the acceptance region at a particular value of µ. In practice, this
means that for a given value of µ, one ﬁnds the interval [x1, x2] such that R(x1) = R(x2)

We solve for x1 and x2 numerically to the desired precision, for each µ in a grid with
0.001 spacing. With the acceptance regions all constructed, we then read oﬀ the conﬁdence
intervals [µ1, µ2] for each x0 as in Fig. 1.

Table X contains the results for representative measured values and conﬁdence levels.

Figure 10 shows the conﬁdence belt for 90% C.L.

It is instructive to compare Fig. 10 with Fig. 3. At large x, the conﬁdence intervals
[µ1, µ2] are the same in both plots, since that is far away from the constraining boundary.
Below x = 1.28, the lower endpoint of the new conﬁdence intervals is zero, so that there is
automatically a transition from two-sided conﬁdence intervals to an upper conﬁdence limit

given by µ2. The point of this transition is ﬁxed by the calculation of the acceptance interval
for µ = 0; the solution has x1 =
, and so Eq. 4.4 is satisﬁed by x2 = 1.28 when α = 90%.
Of course, one is not obligated to claim a non-null discovery just because the 90% C.L.
conﬁdence interval does not contain zero. With a proper understanding of what conﬁdence
intervals are (Sec. II B), one realizes that they do not indicate degree of belief.

Our 90% C.L. upper limit at x = 0 is µ2 = 1.64, which, interestingly, is the standard
95% C.L. upper limit, rather than µ2 = 1.28, which is the standard 90% C.L. upper limit.
The departure from the standard 90% C.L. upper limits reﬂects the fact, mentioned above,
that they provide frequentist coverage only when the decision to quote an upper limit is not
based on the data. Our method repairs the undercoverage caused by ﬂip-ﬂopping (Fig.4),
with a necessary cost in loosening the upper limits around x = 0.

As x decreases, the upper limits from our method decrease, asymptotically going as 1/
x

for large negative x. As in the Poisson case, particular caution is necessary when interpreting
limits obtained from measured values of x which are unlikely for all physical µ.

C. Decoupling of Goodness-of-Fit C.L. from the Conﬁdence Interval C.L.

An advantage of our intervals compared to the standard classical intervals is that ours
eﬀectively decouple the conﬁdence level used for a goodness-of-ﬁt test from the conﬁdence
level used for conﬁdence interval construction.

To elaborate, let us ﬁrst recall the procedure used in a standard “easy” χ2 ﬁt (free from
constraints, background, etc.), for example the ﬁt of a one-parameter curve to a set of points
with Gaussian error bars. One examines the χ2 between the data and the ﬁtted curve, as
function of the ﬁt parameter. The value of χ2 at its minimum is used to determine goodness-
of-ﬁt: using standard tables, one can convert this value to a goodness-of-ﬁt conﬁdence level
which tells one the quality of the ﬁt. A very poor ﬁt means that the information on the
ﬁtted parameter is suspect: the experimental uncertainties may not be assessed properly,
the functional form of the parametrized curve may be wrong, or, in the most general terms,
the hypotheses being considered may not be the relevant ones.

If the value of the minimum χ2 is considered acceptable, then one examines the shape of
χ2 (as a function of the ﬁt parameter) near its minimum, in order to obtain an (approximate)
conﬁdence interval for the ﬁt parameter at any desired conﬁdence level. This procedure is
powerful because it does not permit random ﬂuctuations that favor no particular parameter
value to inﬂuence the conﬁdence interval. The two conﬁdence levels invoked in this example
are then independent; for example, one may require that the goodness-of-ﬁt C.L. be in the
top 99% in order to consider the ﬁt to be acceptable, while quoting a 68% C.L. conﬁdence
interval for the ﬁtted parameter.

The problems with the standard classical intervals in Sec. III can be viewed from the
point of view that they eﬀectively constrain the C.L. used for goodness-of-ﬁt to be related
to that used for the conﬁdence interval. In both the Gaussian and the Poisson upper limit
examples, consider, for example, 90% as the C.L. for upper limits; the conﬁdence interval
is the empty set (or outside the physical region, some prefer to say) some fraction of the
time which is determined by this choice of C.L. For example, if the true mean is zero in
the constrained Gaussian problem, then the empty set is obtained 10% of the time from
Fig. 2; if the true mean is zero in the Poisson-with-background problem, the empty set can

10

be obtained up to 10% of the time from conﬁdence belts such as Fig. 5 (depending on the
mean background b, and on how discreteness aﬀects the intervals for that b.) An empty-set
conﬁdence interval has the same eﬀect as failing a goodness-of-ﬁt test: no useful conﬁdence
interval is inferred. With the standard conﬁdence intervals, one is forced to use a speciﬁc
C.L. for this eﬀective goodness-of-ﬁt test, coupled to the C.L. used for interval construction.
We believe this to be most undesirable, and at the heart of the community’s dissatisfaction
with the standard intervals.

In contrast, our construction always provides a conﬁdence interval at the desired con-
ﬁdence level (with of course some conservatism for the discrete problems). Independently,
one can calculate the analog of goodness-of-ﬁt, and decide whether or not to consider the
data or model (including mean expected background) to be invalid. This issue arises in the
case when an upper limit is quoted; i.e., the conﬁdence interval is [0, µ2].

In the constrained Gaussian case, one might have data x0 =

2.0 and hence 90% C.L.
conﬁdence interval [0, 0.4] from Tab. X. The natural analog for goodness-of-ﬁt is the prob-
ability to obtain x

x0 under the best-ﬁt assumption of µ = 0.

−

In the Poisson-with-background case, one might have data n0 = 1 for b = 3, and hence
90% C.L. conﬁdence interval [0, 1.88] from Tab. IV. The natural analog for goodness-of-ﬁt
is the probability to obtain n

n0 under the best-ﬁt assumption of µ = 0.

As noted above, in Fig. 8 we follow the practice of the PDG [2] by indicating with dashed
lines those regions where the goodness-of-ﬁt criterion is less than 1%. In Tables II-X, the
corresponding intervals are italicized.

≤

≤

In summary, because our intervals decouple of the conﬁdence level used for a goodness-
of-ﬁt test from the conﬁdence level used for conﬁdence interval construction, one is free to
choose them independently, at whatever level desired.

V. APPLICATION TO NEUTRINO OSCILLATION SEARCHES

A. The Experimental Problem

Experimental searches for neutrino oscillations provide an example of the application of
this technique to a multidimensional problem. Indeed it is just this problem that originally
focused our attention on this investigation.

Experiments of this type search for a transformation of one species of neutrino into
another. To be concrete, we assume that the experiment is to search for transformations
between muon type neutrinos, νµ, and electron type neutrinos, νe, and that the inﬂuence of
other types of neutrinos can be ignored. We hypothesize that the weak eigenstates
and
νei

The result of such an experiment is typically represented as a two-dimensional conﬁdence
region in the plane of the two unknown physical parameters, θ, the rotation angle between
the weak and mass eigenstates, and ∆m2, the (positive) diﬀerence between the squares of
the neutrino masses. Traditionally, sin2(2θ) is plotted along the horizontal axis and ∆m2 is
plotted along the vertical axis. An example of such a plot is shown in Fig. 11, based on a
toy model that we develop below. In this example, no evidence for oscillations is seen and
the conﬁdence region is set as the area to the left of the curve in this ﬁgure.

B. The Proposed Technique for Determining Conﬁdence Regions

The problem of setting the conﬁdence region for a neutrino oscillation search experiment
often shares all of the diﬃculties discussed in the previous sections. The variable sin2(2θ)
is clearly bounded by zero and one. Values outside this region can have no possible inter-
pretation within the theoretical framework that deﬁnes the unknown physical parameters.
Yet consider an experiment searching in a region of ∆m2 in which oscillations either do not
exist or are well below the sensitivity of the experiment. Such an experiment is typically
searching for a small signal of excess νe interactions in a potentially large background of νe
interactions from conventional sources and misidentiﬁed νµ interactions. Thus, it is equally
likely to have a best ﬁt to a negative value of sin2(2θ) as to a positive one, provided that
the ﬁt to Eq. (5.3) is unconstrained.

Typically, the experimental measurement consists of counting the number of events in an
arbitrary number of bins [17] in the observed energy of the neutrino and possibly other mea-
sured variables, such as the location of the interaction in the detector. Thus, the measured
data consist of a set N
, together with an assumed known mean expected background
B

and a calculated expected oscillation contribution T

≡ {
To construct the conﬁdence region, the experimenter must choose an ordering principle
to decide which of the large number of possible N sets should be included in the acceptance
region for each point on the sin2(2θ)
∆m2 plane. We suggest the ordering principle identical
to the one suggested in Sec IV, namely the ratio of the probabilities

since it can be used in all cases.

To demonstrate how this works in practice, and how it compares to alternative approaches
that have been used, we consider a toy model of a typical neutrino oscillation experiment.
The toy model is deﬁned by the following parameters: Mesons are assumed to decay to
neutrinos uniformly in a region 600 m to 1000 m from the detector. The expected background
from conventional νe interactions and misidentiﬁed νµ interactions is assumed to be 100
events in each of 5 energy bins which span the region from 10 to 60 GeV. We assume that
the νµ ﬂux is such that if P (νµ →
νe) = 0.01 averaged over any bin, then that bin would

∆m2 plane is calculated by per-
forming a Monte Carlo simulation of the results of a large number of experiments for the
given set of unknown physical parameters and the known neutrino ﬂux of the actual ex-
periment. For each experiment, ∆χ2 is calculated according to the prescription of either
Eq. 5.5 or 5.6. The single number that is needed for each point in the sin2(2θ)

is ∆χ2

the data are analyzed, ∆χ2 for the data and each point in the sin2(2θ)

(5.7)

Figure 11 is an example of the result of a calculation for a random experiment in the toy

model for which there were no oscillations, i.e., for sin2(2θ) = 0.

One might naively expect that ∆χ2

c = 4.61, the 90% C.L. value for a χ2 distribution with
two degrees of freedom. For the toy model, it actually varies from about 2.4 to 6.6 across
the sin2(2θ)

∆m2 plane. The deviation from 4.61 is caused by at least three eﬀects:

−

1. Proximity to the unphysical region. Points close to the unphysical region occasionally
have best ﬁts in the unphysical region. Since our algorithm restricts ﬁts to the physical
region, these ﬁts give a lower ∆χ2 than unrestricted ﬁts.

2. Sinusoidal nature of the oscillation function. The χ2 distribution assumes a Gaussian
probability density function, but the oscillation probability function is sinusoidal. For
high values of ∆m2 ﬂuctuations can cause a global minimum in a “wrong” trough of
the function, increasing the value of ∆χ2 from what it would be if there were only one
trough.

3. One-dimensional regions. In some regions of the plane, the probability distribution
function becomes one rather than two dimensional. For example, at very low values
of ∆m2 the only relevant quantity is the number of events in the lowest energy bin,
since the oscillation probability, Eq. ( 5.3), is proportional to 1/E2 for suﬃciently low

13

∆m2. Fluctuations in higher energy bins do not lead to any physical interpretation,
and thus cancel in the calculation of ∆χ2. In these regions, ∆χ2
c tends to lower values
than normal.

C. Comparison to Alternative Classical Methods

Most papers reporting the results of neutrino oscillation searches have not been explicit
enough for us to determine exactly how the conﬁdence regions were set. However, we can
imagine three classical methods that either have or could have been used. We refer to these
as the Raster Scan, the Flip-Flop Raster Scan, and the Global Scan. All of them have the
advantage that a Gaussian approximation is made so that a full Neyman construction of the
conﬁdence region is not necessary.

1. The Raster Scan: For each value of ∆m2, a best ﬁt is made for sin2(2θ). At each ∆m2,
χ2 is calculated as a function of sin2(2θ), and the 1-D conﬁdence interval in sin2(2θ) at
that ∆m2 is taken to be all points that have a χ2 within 2.71 of the minimum value.
(2.71 is the two-sided 90% C.L. for a χ2 distribution with one degree of freedom.) The
conﬁdence region in the (sin2(2θ), ∆m2) plane is then the union of all these intervals.

2. The Flip-Flop Raster Scan: Similar to the Raster Scan except that a decision to use
a one-sided upper limit or a two-sided interval is made based on the data. If there is
a signal with signiﬁcance greater than three standard deviations, the Raster Scan is
used. If not, an upper limit is set by a raster scan using the one-sided 90% C.L. ∆χ2
value of 1.64.

3. The Global Scan: A best ﬁt is made to both sin2(2θ) and ∆m2, and the conﬁdence
region is given as all points that have a χ2 within 4.61 of the minimum value. (As
mentioned above, 4.61 is the two-sided 90% C.L. for a χ2 distribution with two degrees
of freedom.)

In all three cases, we assume that there is no restriction that the best ﬁt be in the physical
region. This is because the method of using a ﬁxed ∆χ2 depends on the reference χ2 being
the minimum of a parabolic χ2 distribution. Any attempt to restrict the minimum to the
physical region automatically gives improper coverage. Thus, all three of these methods
suﬀer from the possibility that they could either rule out the entire physical plane, or give
limits which are not characteristic of the sensitivity of the experiment.

We have used the toy model to study the coverage of each of these techniques. The
Raster Scan gives exact coverage. However, it is not a powerful technique in that it cannot
distinguish a likely value of ∆m2 from an unlikely one, since it works at ﬁxed ∆m2. This is
best illustrated in the case in which a positive signal is found. Figure 12 shows the conﬁdence
regions for both the Raster Scan and our proposed technique for a sample case for which
t = 40 (eV/c2)2 and sin2(2θt) = 0.006. Both techniques provide exact coverage, but the
∆m2
proposed technique isolates the signal, with one ghost region, while the Raster Scan does
not.

Since the Raster Scan gives exact coverage, it will not surprise the reader to learn that
the Flip-Flop Raster Scan undercovers for the reasons given in Sec. III. Figure 13 shows the

14

region of signiﬁcant undercoverage (greater than 1%) for the Flip-Flop Raster Scan. The
coverage drops as low as 85%, as is to be expected from the discussion in Sec. III. To set
the scale, a quantity we call the “sensitivity” is also shown in this ﬁgure. The sensitivity is
deﬁned as the result that one would get if the measured values exactly equaled the estimated
background. We discuss the use of this quantity further in Sec. VI.

Unlike the Raster Scan and Flip-Flop Raster Scan, the Global Scan is a powerful tech-
nique. However, it suﬀers from not giving proper coverage for the reasons enumerated at
the end of the previous subsection (numbers 2 and 3). It has both regions of undercoverage
and overcoverage, as shown in Fig. 14. The coverage varies across the plane from about 76%
to 94%.

Table XI summarizes the properties of the proposed technique and the three alternative

techniques that we have considered.

VI. THE PROBLEM OF FEWER EVENTS THAN EXPECTED BACKGROUND

We started this investigation to solve the problem in classical statistics in which an
experiment which measures signiﬁcantly fewer events than are expected from backgrounds
will report a meaningless or unphysical result. While we have solved that problem, our
solution still yields results that are bothersome to some in that an experiment that measures
fewer events than expected from backgrounds will report a lower upper limit than an identical
experiment that measures a number of events equal to that expected from background. This
seems particularly troublesome in the case in which the experiment has no observed events.
Why should an experiment claim credit for expected backgrounds, when it is clear, in that
particular experiment, there were none? Or why should a well designed experiment which
has no background and observes no events be forced to report a higher upper limit than a
less well designed experiment which expects backgrounds, but, by chance, observes none?

The origin of these concerns lies in the natural tendency to want to interpret these
x0) of a hypothesis given data, rather than what they are
results as the probability P (µt|
really related to, namely the probability P (x0
µ) of obtaining data given a hypothesis. It
is the former that a scientist may want to know in order to make a decision, but the latter
which classical conﬁdence intervals relate to. As we discussed in Sec. II A, scientists may
x0) based on experimental results combined with their
make Bayesian inferences of P (µt|
personal, subjective prior probability distribution function.
It is thus incumbent on the
experimenter to provide information that will assist in this assessment.

|

Our suggestion for doing this is that in cases in which the measurement is less than the
estimated background, the experiment report both the upper limit and the “sensitivity” of
the experiment, where the “sensitivity” is deﬁned as the average upper limit that would be
obtained by an ensemble of experiments with the expected background and no true signal.
Table XII gives these values.

Thus, an experiment that measures 2 events and has an expected background of 3.5
events would report a 90% C.L. upper limit of 2.7 events (from Tab. IV), but a sensitivity
of 4.6 events (from Tab. XII).

Figure 15 represents a common occurrence for a neutrino oscillation search experiment.
It is a repeat of Fig. 11, an example of the toy model in which sin2(2θ) = 0, but with the
sensitivity shown by a dashed line. The behavior is typical of what one would expect. Due to

15

random ﬂuctuations, the upper limit is greater than the sensitivity for some values of ∆m2
and less than others. In this case, it is due to ﬂuctuations, but in an actual experiment, it
could also be due to the presence of a signal around or below the experiment’s sensitivity
at some value ∆m2, making other values of ∆m2 less likely. Again, for cases in which a
signiﬁcant portion of the upper limit curve is below the sensitivity of the experiment, we
suggest that the sensitivity curve be displayed as well as the upper limit.

VII. CONCLUSION

The construction described in this paper strictly adheres to the Neyman method [1],
as applied to discrete distributions since the 1930’s [13–15]. Thus, the resulting conﬁdence
intervals are ﬁrmly grounded in classical statistics theory. What is new is the particular
choice of ordering we make within the freedom inherent in Neyman’s method. This choice,
described in Sec. IV, yields intervals which automatically change over from upper limits to
two-sided intervals as the “signal” becomes more statistically signiﬁcant. This eliminates
undercoverage caused by basing this choice on the data (“ﬂip-ﬂopping”). Our tables give
classical conﬁdence intervals for the two common problems for which the PDG has described
Bayesian solutions incorporating a (questionable) uniform prior for a bounded variable:
Poisson processes with background, and Gaussian errors with a bounded physical region.
This introduction of Bayesian methods was at least partly motivated by problems with the
traditional classical intervals (non-physical or empty-set intervals; coupling of goodness-of-
ﬁt C.L. with conﬁdence interval C.L.) which our new intervals solve. Thus, there should be
renewed discussion of the appropiateness of Bayesian intervals for reporting experimental
measurements in an objective way.

The new ordering principle can be applied quite generally. We have developed the appli-
cation to neutrino oscillation searches, where the conﬁdence region can have a particularly
complicated stucture due to physical constraints and multiple local minima in the pdf’s.

Finally, we certainly agree that no matter how one constructs an interval, it is important
to publish relevant ingredients to the calculation so that the reader (and the PDG) can
(at least approximately) perform alternative calculations or combine the result with other
experiments [19].
In the Gaussian case, the ingredients are the measured value (even if
non-physical) and the standard error. (Separating the statistical and systematic errors, as
is often done, is even better). In the case of a counting experiment with known background,
the required ingredients are: the number of observed events; the expected mean background;
and the factor (incorporating, e.g., integrated luminosity, eﬃciencies, etc.,) which converts
the number of observed events to the relevant physics quantity (cross section, branching
ratio, etc.).

intervals between the belts) quoted by ﬂip-ﬂopping Physicist X, described in the text. They are
not valid conﬁdence belts, since they can cover the true value at a frequency less than the stated
conﬁdence level. For 1.36 < µ < 4.28, the coverage (probability contained in the horizontal
acceptance interval) is 85%.

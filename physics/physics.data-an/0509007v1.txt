The repository of physical models used for the
CODATA-2002 FPC (re-)evaluation

Andrey S. Siver a,

aInstitute for High Energy Physics, Russia

Abstract

We present PAREVAL package containing a repository of theoretical physical mod-
els used for (re-)evaluation of the fundamental physical constants (FPC). It holds all
necessary data for building 105 (so called) observational equations and can be used
in high precision calculations. Among repository models there are expressions for
energy levels of hydrogen and deuterium (with 16 types of contributions), electron
and muon magnetic moment anomalies, muonium ground-state hyperﬁne splitting,
Zeeman energy levels in muonium. Each model is represented as Mathematica mod-
ule with XML meta-data keeping information about the model (including data on
dependence from others models). There are also modules for working with the basic
FPC.

1 Introduction

PAREVAL package is a set of Mathematica modules and notebooks which can
be arranged by following:

• The repository of physical models (i.e. Mathematica modules with some

• Modules for the FPC usage. Contain data and functions for the FPC usage

meta-data in XML);

in high-precision calculations;

• Notebooks with examples. The most interesting example is probably our

re-evaluation of the basic FPC-2002;

• Module for the ﬁnal presentation of correlated quantities. Contain functions
for the ﬁnal rounding of results (according with techniques described in [3]).

Each repository module deﬁnes some Mathematica symbols (variables or func-
tions). Value of the deﬁned symbol usually corresponds to some physical ex-
pression. So the content of the repository we can represent as the realization
of some phenomenological physical knowledge.

Now the models are precisely taken from [1] and the correctness of their rep-
resentation was checked during our re-evaluation of the basic FPC.

Scientists from “Fundamental Constants Data Center” at National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) carried out a great work on collecting
data which can be used for precision determination of the values of the FPC.
We think that the theoretical expressions, on which the evaluation is based
on, are interesting by itself and it’s the main motivation for designing the
PAREVAL package.

New theoretical expressions can be easily add to the repository by the user. For
example, one could ﬁnd a module (M1), which should be improved, introduce
a new Mathematica symbol (or function) into it, place calculations for the
symbol into separate module ﬁle and at last include the module name in
dependence list in XML meta-data ﬁle of the ﬁrst module M1 (thus it will be
loaded by the corresponding repository function before the M1 module). We
represent this to ourselves as ‘breadth evolution’ of the repository.

Since Mathematica allows in principle to carry out any calculations, it’s pos-
sible to replace a model by another module calculated from more general
principles. We call this by ‘depth evolution’.

As one can see repository models can be written in terms of the basic funda-
mental physical constants. Let’s notice that the basic FPC is a some subset
of the FPC which have following property: each of the FPC can be precisely
expressed as the function of the basic ones. So after evaluation the basic FPC
all the FPC can be calculated.

1.1 A simple technology for accounting computational uncertainties

In our FPC-2002 evaluation we have been generally based on the reviews
[1], [2]. But in the realization of the models we embedded some our ideas.
We’ve designed a simple technology for accounting for values with calculation
uncertainties.

Some parts of theoretical expressions for physical quantities come from nu-
merical calculations, ﬁts or approximations and only numerical values are
usually known for them. They usually have uncertainties which should be ac-
counted for. We solve the problem as following. Instead of use a scalar value
A (which have an uncertainty U) we insert an object ‘ss[A,U,Label]’ (Mathe-
matica function) into corresponding Mathematica expression and have created
several function ‘svalue’, ‘suncer’ which suppress the ‘ss[...]’ objects (from the
expression) and use corresponding information from it:

• ‘svalue[expr]’ - gets out the value of the expression ‘expr’ in which ‘A’ value

is used for every ‘ss[A,U,Label]’;

• ‘suncer[expr]’ - gets out the uncertainty of the expression ‘expr’ where ob-
jects {‘ss[A,U,Label]’} are considered as independent stochastic quantities
(with corresponding normal distributions) with uncertainties {‘U’}.

‘Label’ data can be used to identify the object in the expression.

2 The repository of physical models

Each repository model is represented as Mathematica module (i.e. ‘NAME.m’
ﬁle, where ‘NAME’ is the name of the model) and ‘NAME.xml’ ﬁle with the
following structure of XML tags:

<m> <!-- the model opening tag -->

<dep> ‘sequence of the names of models which should be loaded

before this model’ </dep>

<p> <!-- parameters opening tag -->

<inp> ‘sequence of the input parameters’ </inp>
<out> ‘sequence of the output parameters’ </out>

• Data on the observational equations. Group ”A” http://hermes.ihep.su/fpc/table-oes-a.xhtml;
• Data on the observational equations. Group ”B” http://hermes.ihep.su/fpc/table-oes-b.xhtml;

<sha> ‘sequence of the shared parameters’ </sha>

</p> <!-- parameters closing tag -->
<title> ‘the title of the model’ </title>

</m> <!-- the model closing tag -->

The repository models are listed in the Appendix A.

These models were enough for building 105 (so called) observational equations
(i.e. expressions which : (1) were measured experimentally (or in some special
cases calculated or estimated theoretically); (2) can be expressed in terms of
the FPC) selected by the CODATA-2002.

These observational equations can be separated into two groups ”A” (princi-
ple observational equations for determination of the Rydberg constant) and
”B” (principle observational equations for determination of some others basic
FPC).

In order to show the correctness of the repository models we prepared several
web-pages with the data on the observational equations 1 .

Firstly, we would like to present a table where experimental data are compared
with theoretical ones:

Let’s make some comment:

• Correlation coeﬃcients of the input data for FPC-2002 evaluation are pre-

sented on the page: http://hermes.ihep.su/fpc/table-oes-corr.xhtml

• ”ID” column: The numbers after A’-, B’- indicate on the position from the
beginning of the group (For ”A” group it corresponds to CODATA-2002
“LSA index” (see, for example, a table from NIST web site
http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/LSAData/qdata.pdf), ”B’1” corresponds to 51
“LSA index”, ”B’2” to 52 and so on). So ordering of the observational
equations is precisely the same as used in the CODATA-2002 evaluation);
• ”Exp. uncer.”, ”Rel. exp. unc.”: experimental and relative experimental

uncertainties correspondingly;

• ”Theor. uncer.”, ”Rel. theor. unc.”: theoretical and relative theoretical un-
certainties correspondingly. Theoretical uncertainty arises from the uncer-
tainties of the FPC (including δ-corrections due to uncalculated terms) ac-
cording to the law of uncertainty propagation;

• ”Calc. uncer.”: Calculational uncertainty was shortly discussed in the sec-
tion 1.1. It’s due to the uncertainties that some of auxiliary parameters in
theoretical expressions have. Large calculation uncertainty for A’1 observa-
tional equation is mainly due to uncertainty of C50 coeﬃcient from expres-
sion for three photon correction ([1], p.82). We believe that it was reduced
by introduction the δN(n, L, j) 2 with corresponding auxilary observational
equations (and corresponding correlation coeﬃcients). From other hand it
shows that computational uncertainty is rough estimation of the uncertainty
(but possibly more reliable);

• ”Cal.uncer/Th.uncer” : Ratio of the computational uncertainty to the the-

oretical one. It’s is an indicator: usually it should be less then 0.1;

• ”(Exp.-Theor.)/Unc.” is an indicator of agreement of theoretical and experi-

mental values. ”Unc.” is the total uncertainty: Unc. =
(where UX is corresponding uncertainty);

theory

• ”Original expression” is original expression for observational equation from

the repository model.

Secondly, we show tables of data calculated by NIST (after FPC-2002 evalu-
ation) and with the PAREVAL:

• Comparison values of the observational equations of the group ”A”: CODATA-

2002/NIST vs. PAREVAL
http://hermes.ihep.su/fpc/table-oes-a NIST PARE.xhtml;

• Comparison values of the observational equations of the group ”B”: CODATA-

2002/NIST vs. PAREVAL
http://hermes.ihep.su/fpc/table-oes-b NIST PARE.xhtml.

Comments are followings:

• Rows are sorted by the values of ﬁfth column – indicator of computational

agreement;

• ”Exp.Uncer.” is experimental uncertainty. Usually it deﬁnes the level of
required precision so we compare the values via it: it should be less then 10%
normally (in our case the maximum value is less then 7% with maximum
for A’14 item).

So as one can see we have good agreement with NIST calculations of the
observational equations.

3 The results of our FPC-2002 re-evaluation

The most interesting example of the repository usage is probably our re-
evaluation of the basic FPC-2002.

We obtained good agreement with CODATA-2002 values of the basic FPC:
the maximum value of the ‘Pull′ = |(zP AREV AL − zCODAT A)/UP AREV AL| is less
then 4% (where by zX we denote corresponding value of the basic FPC).

All the constants uncertainties obtained by us are very closely to CODATA-
2002 ones in the meaning |UP AREV AL/UCODAT A − 1| < 1% , where by UX we
denoted uncertainty of the constant (for CODATA-2002 and our results).

One can see results of our evaluation from the followings web-pages 3 :

• The table with the basic FPC http://hermes.ihep.su/fpc/table-fpc.xhtml;
• The correlation matrix of the basic FPC http://hermes.ihep.su/fpc/table-fpc-corr.xhtml;

To determine the number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures for ﬁnal rounding procedure
for the uncertainties of the basic FPC we use an expression [3]:

The main goal of this paper is an appliation of Bayesian model om-

parison, based on the posterior probabilities and posterior odds ratios, in

testing the explanatory power of the set of ompeting GARCH (ang. Gener-

alized Autoregressive Conditionally Heterosedasti) spei(cid:28)ations, all with

asymmetri and heavy tailed onditional distributions. In building ompet-

ing volatility models we onsider, as an initial spei(cid:28)ation, onditionally

Student-t GARCH proess with unknown degrees of freedom parameter,

proposed in [7℄. By introduing skewness into Student-t family and in-

orporating the resulting lass as a onditional distribution we generated

various GARCH models, whih ompete in explaining possible asymme-

try of both onditional and unonditional distribution of (cid:28)nanial data.

In order to make Student-t family skewed we onsider various alternative

mehanisms reently proposed in the literature. In partiular, we apply the

hidden trunation mehanism (see [3℄, [1℄), an approah based on the in-

verse sale fators in the positive and the negative orthant (see [10℄), order

statistis onept ([14℄), Beta distribution transformation ([15℄) and Bern-

stein density transformation (see [27℄). Additionally, we onsider GARCH

proess with onditional α-Stable distribution, see [29℄, [28℄. Based on the

daily returns of hypothetial (cid:28)nanial time series, we disuss the results of

Bayesian omparison of alternative skewing mehanisms applied in the ini-

tial Student-t GARCH framework. We also hek the sensitivity of model

ranking with respet to the hanges in prior distribution of model spei(cid:28)

parameters. Additionally, we present formal Bayesian inferene about on-

ditional asymmetry of the distribution of the daily returns in all ompeting

spei(cid:28)ations on the basis of the skewness measure de(cid:28)ned in [2℄.

1. Introdution

The presene of both, onditional and unonditional skewnes (asymme-

try) of the distributions of the (cid:28)nanial time series returns has been re-

ognized for deades. But, as suggest [18℄, only a few attempts to speify

formally this feature have been made. A proper modeling of skewnes in

the distribution of (cid:28)nanial returns is important at least for two reasons.

Firstly, unaptured skewnes learly a(cid:27)ets inferene on other parameters of

the sampling model. As a onsequene the (cid:28)nal onlusions, drawn from

the sampling model whih does not allow for asymmetry an be misleading.

Lanne and Saikkonnen present in [18℄ the impat of the onditional skew-

ness assumption on the results of making inferene about the volatility and

expeted return. They presented empirial analysis, whih showed, that a

positive and signi(cid:28)ant relation between return and risk an be unovered,

one an appropriate probability distribution is employed to allow for ondi-

tional asymmetry. Motivating the importane of asset priing model that

inorporates onditional asymmetry, [?℄ emphasize that systemati skewnes

is eonomially important and ommands a risk premium. Investigating the

in(cid:29)uene of the assumption of asymmetri distributions in portfolio sele-

tion, [17℄ onluded, that, if investors prefer right-skewed portfolios, then for

equal variane one should expet a "skew premium" to reward investors will-

ing to invest in left-skewed portfolios. Seondly, in priing the derivatives

and in risk management, the aurate models, whih desribe the return

proess are partiularly desired. [30℄, [16℄ and [8℄ presented the importane

of the assumption of onditional skewnes in models used for option priing.

Additionally, onditional skewnes learly in(cid:29)uenes the results of risk assess-

ment built on the basis of the Value at Risk (VaR) onept. Appliation of

time varying volatility models with onditional asymmetri distributions in

Value at Risk predition present [9℄; for a Bayesian approah to VaR alu-

lation see [28℄.

Within GARCH (Generalised Autoregressive Conditionally Heterosedas-

ti) framework, initially proposed by [6℄ as a onditionally normal stohasti

proess, fat tailed and possibly asymmetri distributions have been also pro-

posed and applied. Osiewalski and Pipie« in [25℄ de(cid:28)ned GARCH proess

with onditional skewed Student-t distribution, whih is an asymmetri gen-

eralisation of Student-t family proposed by [10℄. In [20℄ [19℄ and [29℄ GARCH

proess with onditional α-Stable distribution was onsidered. Some other

proesses with asymmetri onditional distribution were applied in [?℄, [29℄,

[31℄, and [9℄. Despite of the fat, that many researhers found the ondi-

tionally skewed volatility models better than those, whih do not allow for

asymmetry, there is very hard to (cid:28)nd the result of the formal omparison

of explanatory power of suh spei(cid:28)ations. Many authors onlude the

Bayesian printed on 21st February 2014

superiority of onditional skewed models on the basis either of the asymp-

totially based statistial signi(cid:28)ane of the skewnes exess (see e.g. [31℄, or

[18℄) or of informal likelihood inferene (see e.g. [29℄, [31℄). Hene more for-

mal approah to investigating the explanatory power of onditionally skewed

models seems to be neessary. Additionally, the results of formal omparison

of ompeting unnested spei(cid:28)ations of onditional skewness ould be very

valuable in seletion the best skewing mehanism.

On the other hand, in reent years in statistis it an be notied a peu-

liar interest in the theory and appliations of distributions that an aount

for skewnes. This resurgent (cid:28)eld of researh yields new families of possibly

asymmetri sampling models, as well as more general methods of measuring

skewnes phenomenon. The most ommon approah to the reation of the

family of skewed distributions is to introdue skewnes into an originally sym-

metri family of distributions. This approah underlies the general lasses of

skewed probability distributions generated for example by hidden trunation

mehanism (see [3℄, [1℄), inverse sale fators applied to the positive and the

negative orthant (see [10℄), order statistis onept ([14℄), Beta distribution

transformation ([15℄), Bernstein density transformation (see [27℄) and the

onstrutive method reently proposed by [11℄.

The main goal of this paper is to de(cid:28)ne a set of ompeting GARCH spe-

i(cid:28)ations, all with asymmetri onditional distributions, whih also allow

for heavy tails. As an initial spei(cid:28)ation we onsider GARCH model with

onditional Student-t distribution with unknown degrees of freedom param-

eter, proposed by [7℄. By introduing skewnes, aording to the methods

mentioned above, and by inorporating the resulting family as a onditional

distribution, we generate GARCH models whih ompete in explaining pos-

sible asymmetry of the onditional and unonditional distribution of the

(cid:28)nanial data. We also onsider GARCH proess with onditional α-Stable

distribution, whih, from the de(cid:28)nition, also allows for skewnes, see [24℄.

By appliation of Bayesian approah to model omparison, based on the pos-

terior probabilities and posteriori odds ratios, we test formally the explana-

tory power of ompeting, onditionally fat tailed and asymmetri GARCH

proesses. Based on the daily returns of hypothetial (cid:28)nanial time series,

we disuss the results of Bayesian omparison of alternative skewing meh-

anisms and also hek the sensitivity of model ranking with respet to the

hanges in prior distribution of model spei(cid:28) parameters. Additionally we

present formal Bayesian inferene about onditional asymmetry in all om-

peting spei(cid:28)ations on the basis of the skewnes measure de(cid:28)ned in [2℄.

εf ; εf : Ω

H . The uni(cid:28)ed representation

→

of univariate skewed distributions that we study in this paper is based on

the inverse probability transformation. In our approah the lass I is the
initial family of symmetri distributions, while the lass P de(cid:28)nes formally

skewing mehanism. The family of absolute ontinuous random variables

A number of simple but powerful results an be obtained from deompo-

sition (1); see [11℄. The most important and rather intuitive fat is that

the distributions s and f are idential if and only if p(.
ηp) is the density of
|
ηp) = 1, for eah
the uniform distribution over the unit interval; i.e. if p(y

de(cid:28)nes the density of uniform distribution, we obtain, that for γ3 = γ

the density s is symmetri. In (3) there is still only one parameter γ3 > 0,
whih de(cid:28)nes the type of asymmetry. If γ3 > 1, then s is right asymmetri,
while γ3 < 1 onstitutes left asymmetri ase.
The family IP of skewed distributions proposed in (3) an be generalized, by
imposing Beta distribution transformation with two free parameters a > 0
and b > 0. This leads to the following form for s

In this ase the vetor ηp = (a, b) ontains two parameters, whih govern

skewnes. As a onsequene suh a mehanism enables to vary tail weight. If

a = b = 1 we go bak to symmetry, while a < b or a > b de(cid:28)nes left or right

skewnes. It an be shown that the skewing mehanism (4), in ase when

I is the family of Student-t distributions, yields skewed Student-t family of

distributions proposed in advane in [15℄.

Another method for introduing skewnes into an unimodal distribution is

based on the inverse sale fators on the left and on the right side of the

θ). Investigating this onept Fernandez and Steel

As pointed in [11℄ the general form of density s in (1) seems to be the

good starting point in ompletely nonparametri treatment of the skewing

mehanism p. As εp : Ω

with probability distribution de(cid:28)ned over the unit interval, the possibility

to model it in an unrestrited fashion is tempting. The next approah of

It uses Bernstein densities (see

In order to reate the set of ompeting spei(cid:28)ations, we make use of all

presented skewing mehanisms. We also onsider GARCH proess with on-

ditional α-Stable distribution.

3. Basi model framework and ompeting skewed onditional

distributions

Let denote by xj the value of a urreny at time j . Following [4℄,[5℄ ,
[26℄ let onsider an AR(2) proess for ln xj with asymmetri GARCH(1, 1)
error. In terms of logarithmi growth rates yj = 100 ln(xj/xj−1) our basi

model framework is de(cid:28)ned by the following equation:

yj −

δ = ρ(yj−1 −

δ) + δ1 ln xj−1 + εj

j = 1, 2, . . .

(7)

The AR(2) formulation adopted from [5℄ enables to make inferene on the
presene of a unit root in ln xj . If δ1 = 0, then (7) redues to the AR(1)
proess for yj , i.e. an I(1) proess for ln xj . In an initial spei(cid:28)ation M0
we assume, that the error term εj = zj(hj )0.5

De(cid:28)ning hj we follow GJR-GARCH(1, 1) spei(cid:28)ation proposed in [12℄:

whih allows to model asymmetri reation of onditional dispersion mea-

As a onsequene, in model M0 , the onditional distribution of εj (with
respet to the whole past of the proess, ψj−1 = (. . . , εj−2, εj−1)) is a
Student-t distribution with ν > 0 degrees of freedom parameter, mode
iiSt(ν, ζ1, hj).
ζ1 ∈
In spei(cid:28)ation M0 the onditional distribution of yj is the Student-t distri-

4. Empirial results

In this part we present an empirial example of Bayesian omparison of

all ompeting spei(cid:28)ations. As a basi dataset we onsidered T = 1398
observations of daily growth rates, yj , of the WIBOR one month Zloty in-
terest rate from 20.03.97 till 05.09.02. The variability of daily returns yj
as well as some desriptive statistis are presented on Figure 1. It is lear,
that dynamis of daily returns of the WIBOR1m instrument is very anoma-

lous. Huge outliers, aused by hanges in the monetary poliy, together with

the regions of almost no variability, depits very volatile behaviour of rates

of daily hanges of the Polish zloty middle term interest rate. In spite of

the fat, that in (cid:28)ve years from Marh 1997 to September 2002, the Pol-

ish money market was hanging, our (cid:28)rst attempt to ompare all models

was based on the whole dataset. As seen in Figure 1, negative value of the

skewness statistis learly shows substantial asymmetry of the empirial dis-

tribution. It also may indiate skewness of the onditional distribution of

yj .

In Table 1 we present the results of Bayesian omparison of explanatory

power of all ompeting spei(cid:28)ations. In rows we put the deimal logarithm

of marginal data densities p(y(t)
Mi) (i = 0, 1, . . . , 6), posterior probabili-
|
ties of all models inluding M0 , posterior probabilities of all onditionally
asymmetri GARCH spei(cid:28)ations (Mi, i = 1, . . . , 6) and Bayes fators of

M0 (representing onditional symmetry) against Mi , i = 1, . . . , 6 (repre-
y(t)), for
senting alternative i.e. onditional asymmetry). Both sets of P (Mi|
i = 0, 1, . . . , 6 and i = 1, . . . , 6 were obtained by imposing equal prior model

probabilities.

It is lear, that the modeled dataset of daily returns of WIBOR1m inter-

est rates do not support deisively superiority of any of ompeting skewing

mehanism. The mass of posterior probabilities is rather dispersed among

models. However, the greatest value if P (Mi|

y(t)) reeives onditionally

skewed Student-t GARCH model built on the basis of the hidden truna-

tion idea.

In this ase the value of posterior probability is greater than

44%. The onsidered dataset also support onditionally skewed Student-t

GARCH model with Beta distribution transformation (M3 ) and ondition-
ally α-Stable GARCH spei(cid:28)ation (M6 ). Those three models umulate

about 85% of the posterior probability mass, making all remained spei-

(cid:28)ations (inluding onditionally symmetri M0 ) rather improbable in the

view of the data. Very small value of posterior probability is reeived by

model M4 , whih, just like M3 , is built on the basis of the Beta distribu-

tion transformation, but with two free parameters governing the type of

skewness. The observed time series support parsimony of Beta distribution

transformation with one free skewness parameter (in M3 ) and rejets gen-
eralization proposed by [15℄. Finally, model M4 reeives less than 9% of

posterior probability mass. Also the Bernstein density transformation (with

2 free parameters) leads to very doubtful explanatory power of the resulting
GARCH spei(cid:28)ation. The model M5 is strongly rejeted by the data, as the
value of posterior probability is more than 10 times smaller than posterior
probability of symmetri GARCH model (M0 ). This may lead to the similar

onlusion, as it was pointed by [11℄, that Bernstein densities do not yield

(cid:29)exible skewing mehanism for small values of m, see (6).

On the basis of posterior odds ratios B0i (for i = 1, ..., 6) we arried out

Bayesian testing of onditional asymmetry within presented GARCH frame-

work, aording to the Je(cid:27)reys sale, see [13℄. Exept for M5 , posterior odds
P0i rejet onditional symmetry in favor of skewness of the onditional dis-
tribution of yj in model Mi . In ase of model M2 and M3 , the data strongly
support onditional asymmetry, beause P02 and P03 reahes the third grade
of Je(cid:27)reys sale. The data substantially (grade 2) support M4 and weakly
(grade 1) support M1 both against symmetri M0 . Additionally, poor ex-
planatory power of spei(cid:28)ation M5 is on(cid:28)rmed. The data strongly support
(grade 3) symmetry against skewing mehanism built on the basis of Bern-

stein density transformation.

In Table 2 we present the results of Bayesian inferene about tails and

skewnes of the onditional distribution of daily returns in all ompeting

spei(cid:28)ations. The tails of p(yj|

about model spei(cid:28) skewnes parameters in all models, we also put posterior

also present values of posterior probability of left asymmetry of the density

of posterior probability of left asymmetry of p(yj|

of models M1, M2, M3, M6 the posterior probabilities P (γM < 0

the Berstein density transformation (M5) generates relatively low value of

The main goal of this paper was an appliation of Bayesian model om-

parison in testing the explanatory power of the set of ompeting GARCH

(ang. Generalized Autoregressive Conditionally Heterosedasti) spei(cid:28)a-

tions, all with asymmetri and heavy tailed onditional distributions. As an

initial spei(cid:28)ation we onsidered GARCH proess with onditional Student-

t distribution with unknown degrees of freedom parameter, proposed by [7℄.
By introduing skewnes into Student-t family and by inorporating the re-

sulting lass as a onditional distribution we generated various GARCH

models, whih ompete in explaining possible asymmetry of both ondi-

tional and unonditional distribution of (cid:28)nanial returns. In order to make

Student-t family skewed we onsidered various alternative methods reently

proposed in the literature. In partiular, we applied the hidden trunation

mehanism (see [3℄, [1℄), an approah based on the inverse sale fators in the

positive and the negative orthant (see [10℄), order statistis onept [14℄, two

di(cid:27)erent settings of the Beta distribution transformation [15℄ and Bernstein

density transformation (see [27℄). Additionally, we presented the results of

Bayesian inferene within GARCH proess with onditional α-Stable distri-

bution, (see [29℄, [28℄).

Analysis of posterior probabilities of ompeting spei(cid:28)ations did not lead

to deisive onlusion about superiority of any of the onsidered spei(cid:28)-

y(t)) reeived onditionally skewed

Student-t onditional distribution built on the basis of the hidden trunation

mehanism (see [3℄). The data also supported Beta distribution transforma-

tion with single free parameter and onditionally α-Stable GARCH proess.
Those three models umulated more than 85% of the posterior probability

mass.

The results of Bayesian estimation showed, that in eah ompeting spei-

(cid:28)ation the modeled data set on(cid:28)rmed left asymmetry of the onditional

ψj−1θ, ωi, ηi, Mi). In all models Mi (i = 1, . . . , 6) the pos-
distribution p(yj|
terior distribution of skewness measure γM was situated on the left side of
the value γM = 0 (representing symmetry). However, substantial dispersion
y(t), Mi), as measured by the posterior standard deviation of γM , did
of p(M
|
ψj−1θ, ωi, ηi, Mi). As a re-
not prelude symmetry or right skewness of p(yj|
sult, the posterior probability of left asymmetry (equal to 0.9263), obtained

by appliation of Bayesian model pooling approah, left some unertainty

about the true strength of onditional skewness phenomenon.

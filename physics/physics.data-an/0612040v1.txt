General radar transmission codes that minimize
measurement error of a static target

Juha Vierinen, Markku Lehtinen, Mikko Orisp¨a¨a, and Baylie Damtie

Abstract— The variances of matched and sidelobe free mis-
matched ﬁlter estimators are given for arbitrary coherent targets
in the case of aperiodic transmission. It is shown that mismatched
ﬁltering is often better than matched ﬁltering in terms of estima-
tion accuracy. A search strategy for ﬁnding general transmission
codes that minimize estimation error and satisfy constraints on
code power and amplitude range is then introduced. Results show
that nearly perfect codes, with performance close to a single pulse
with the same total power can be found. Also, ﬁnding these codes
is not computationally expensive and such codes can be found for
all practical code lengths. The estimation accuracy of the newly
found codes are compared to binary phase codes of similar length
and found to be better in terms of estimator variance. Similar
transmission codes might be worth investigating also for sonar
and telecommunications applications.

I. INTRODUCTION

P HASE modulation of a radar transmission is a well known

method for increasing radar transmission power, while
still maintaining a good range resolution. Such transmission
codes can consist of two or more individual phases. The
performance of binary, quadri and polyphase codes has been
thoroughly inspected in terms of heuristic criteria, such as the
integrated sidelobe level (ISL), or peak to sidelobe level (PSL)
[1]–[7]. In previous work, binary phase codes have also been
evaluated in terms of estimation accuracy of a static target,
when using an optimal sidelobe free mismatched ﬁlter for
periodic [8], [9], [12] and aperiodic signals [10].

We ﬁrst examine the behaviour of matched and optimal
sidelobe free mismatched ﬁlter estimators for a point like and
a uniform target. In the case of a point-like target, we get the
well known result that the matched ﬁlter is optimal, and the
sidelobe free mismatched ﬁlter has a larger estimator variance,
which depends mainly on the sidelobe power, and is thus not
necessarily very high. In the case of a uniform target, we see
that the matched ﬁlter produces biased results and in addition
to the bias, it also has a worse estimator variance in many
cases. (Here we consider the mean value of the error term as
bias and call the second moments of the error term around the
mean the estimator variance).

II. GENERAL TRANSMISSION CODE

A code with length L can be described as an inﬁnite
length sequence with a ﬁnite number of nonzero pulses with

work, the amplitudes have been set to 1 and often the number

This will make it possible to compare estimator variances
of codes with different lengths and therefore different total
transmission powers. Also, it is possible to compare codes of
the same length and different transmission power simply by
treating L as transmission power.

III. MEASUREMENT EQUATION

Equation 4 describes the basic principle of estimating a
coherent radar target1 using a linear ﬁlter. When the target
is assumed to be inﬁnite length and using roundtrip time as
range, the scattering from a target is simpliﬁed to convolu-
tion of the transmission with the target. In this convolution
equation, m(t) denotes the measured signal, σ(t) denotes the
unknown target, ǫ(t) denotes the transmitted waveform and
ξ(t) represents thermal noise, which is assumed to be Gaussian
−1. Finally, h(t) represents the
white noise with power SNR

matched or mismatched ﬁlter.

When estimating the power of a target, it is customary
to use several repetitions of a measurement. In this case,
the target and the thermal noise are denoted as random

repeated measurements is then written as

Even though the scattering amplitude and thermal noise
amplitude change between measurements, we assume that
the statistical properties of the thermal noise and the target
are unchanged between measurements, and this is what is
estimated. The target is measured as target power using sample
variance, from which we subtract known bias caused by the
thermal noise entering the ﬁlter. The matched ﬁlter target
power estimator is thus

In other words, the scattering is zero for all other ranges than

not correlated.

In this case, it can be shown that the matched ﬁlter and mis-
matched ﬁlter estimators are both unbiased, ie., E ˆxmis(t) =
E ˆxmat(t) = x. The estimator variances are:

which is a natural result. Figure 1 shows a mismatched and a

P

The target itself is a source of estimation errors, as it
is a Gaussian random variable (self-noise). The only code
dependent terms are the thermal noise terms Bmat and Bmis.
Thus, the only way to reduce estimator variance is to reduce
thermal noise. In the case of a matched ﬁlter, the noise entering
the ﬁlter is independent of the code and proportional decoding
ﬁlter power L. For a mismatched ﬁlter, the thermal noise
term is always larger than the matched ﬁlter equalent, and

many cases these terms will cause the variance of the matched
ﬁlter estimator to be wider than the mismatched ﬁlter estimator
variance.

Figure 3 shows a simulated target that is probed with a
random phase code and then the target power is estimated with
matched and mismatched ﬁlter estimators. A relatively poor
random phase code with R = 0.23 was used to emphasize the
following relevant features:

1) With all but

the smallest signal

to noise ratios the
matched ﬁlter estimator has larger variance. For exam-
ple, if the target is assumed to be completely uniform
x(t) = 1, the matched ﬁlter estimator variance for the
13-bit Barker code is better only when SNR < 0.05.
When the signal to noise ratio is higher than this, the
mismatched ﬁlter has better estimation variance. When
SNR = 1, the estimation variance of the mismatched
ﬁlter is already 11% better for the 13-bit Barker code.
2) The matched ﬁlter has bias which depends on the
sidelobes. For example, when the target is again uniform
x(t) = 1, the bias of the best binary phase codes of
lengths 3 to 42 is around 0.1, in other words, the target
power estimate is 10% higher than it is in reality. In
ﬁgure 3, the bias is about 80%.

3) The mismatched ﬁlter produces larger thermal noise.
This can be seen on the outermost extremes in Figure
3 where x(t) = 0. This is code dependent, and depends
1, the thermal noise of
on the value of R. When R
a mismatched ﬁlter is equal to that of a matched ﬁlter.

→

Figure 4 shows the ratio of matched and mismatched ﬁlter
variances for the best polyphase and binary phase codes of
several different lengths as a function of signal to noise ratio.
When the ratio is smaller than one, the matched ﬁlter performs
better. It can be seen from the ﬁgure that when SNR is
increased, the mismatched ﬁlter is better after some threshold
SNR, and the ratio of variances asymptotically approaches
a certain code dependent ratio. Also, when code length is
increased, the threshold SNR where the mismatched ﬁlter has
better variance is lowered. This can be seen from the behaviour
of the polyphase code of length 1024.

VII. CODE OPTIMALITY

In our considerations, we only concentrate on minimizing
the mismatched ﬁlter estimator variance, because the matched
ﬁlter is biased by the code sidelobes and also often has larger
estimator variance for a distributed target. In any case, it is
possible to inspect matched ﬁlter estimator performance by
using equation 19.

From the equations of mismatched ﬁlter estimator variance
it
the code affects estimation variance. The
is clear that
estimator variance is the same for both distributed and point
targets, so it is sufﬁcient to maximize the ratio R described
in equation 14. But what does maximizing R mean? From eq.
6, which describes a matched ﬁlter in terms of a mismatched
ﬁlter and matched ﬁlter ACF sidelobes r(t), one can see that

VI. DISTRIBUTED TARGET

When the target is not point-like, the situation is different.

In the case of a distributed target, it can be shown that the

sidelobes convolved with the target. By deﬁning the sidelobe
term as

Traditional code optimality criteria also reﬂect code good-

is not that well deﬁned. Still, it is evident from equation 6
that the sidelobes of the code autocorrelation function directly
affect the performance of the mismatched ﬁlter by making the
ﬁlter longer than the matched ﬁlter, allowing more thermal
noise to enter the estimate. Thus, traditional code optimality
criteria such as peak to maximum sidelobe level (PSL) or code
power divided by integrated sidelobe power (MF) will also
reﬂect code goodness. In the limiting case, when P SL

In order to get an overview of how the performance of
codes is distributed among codes, we sampled several code
lengths using 106 randomly chosen polyphase codes (constant
amplitude), and used a histogram to come up with an estimate
distribution of R. This shown in ﬁgure 5. It is evident that as
the code length grows, it becomes nearly impossible to ﬁnd
good codes by searching them in a purely random fashion.
Therefore, in order to proceed numerically, some form of
optimization algorithm was needed.

φk ∈ [0, 2π] for all k.

We used a heuristic optimization algorithm speciﬁcally
created for this task, with the purpose of robustly converging
to a maxima of R as a function of a code, while satisfying
constraints on code amplitude range. The code is described in
algorithm 1. The idea is as follows:

1) We ﬁrst generate a code with all bauds at random phases

and unit amplitudes.

2) For a ﬁxed amount of iterations, a new phase or ampli-
tude is randomized for a randomly selected baud, and R
calculated for the resulting trial code. If the amplitude
is changed, we also select another baud and change its
amplitude in the opposite direction in order to maintain
total code power at L. If the code is good enough, we

3) After each “optimization run”, we will ﬁnd a code at
some local maximum. The optimization runs (Step 2.)
are then repeated with new random initial code until a
satisfactory result has been obtained.

The number of iterations of an optimization run is a tunable
parameter of the algorithm, it varies from 103 for small code
lengths to 106 for codes with length L > 103.

One of the main reasons for robustness of this algorithm is
that it does not follow the largest gradient, but instead follows
a random positive gradient, making it more likely that more

The algorithm has also been applied with some modiﬁca-
tions for more resticted cases, such as binary and quadriphase
codes that are too long to search exhaustively.

IX. SEARCH RESULTS

We applied the search algorithm for code lengths 3 to 4096
using three different amplitude ranges: A1 := [1, 1], A2 :=
[0.95, 1.05] and A3 := [0, 2]. The ﬁrst of these is a polyphase
code with constant amplitude, the other two allow a certain
amount of amplitude deviation around 1. Results are shown
in table I as the best value of R found for given code length
and amplitude range. For comparison, the values of best binary
phase codes are also shown in column B. Some selected codes
are given in table II.2.

The results show that polyphase codes are better than binary
phase codes. When we allow the amplitude of the code to
change, we get still better codes. Nearly all of the codes with
the largest amplitude range A3 have performance comparable
to that achievable with complementary codes. In this case R
is less than 0.5

10−4 from theoretical maximum.
Figures 6, 7 and 8 show several of these codes. The ﬁrst one
is the best polyphase code of length 9. It is interesting because
it has nearly optimal shape of ACF. (The values of the ACF
for lags
8 are necessarily of norm one, because the ﬁrst and
the last element of the code have norm one, but the rest of
the ACF values are close to zero). The second ﬁgure shows
an amplitude and phase modulated code and the third shows
a longer code of length 1024 with more restricted amplitudes.

X. CONCLUSIONS

it

Estimator mean and variance was derived for matched
and mismatched ﬁlter target power estimators in the case
of an arbitrary target. It was seen that
is sufﬁcient to
minimize thermal noise entering the ﬁlter. It was also noted
that matched ﬁlter estimator contains bias and often results
in larger estimator variance than the mismatched ﬁlter when
the target is distributed. The obtained equations for estimator
variance can be used for more speciﬁc radar design problems
where there is prior information of the range and power extent
of the target.

In order to search for optimal mismatched ﬁlter estima-
tor codes, a heuristic constrained random local improvement
algorithm was used to ﬁnd transmission codes that are in
many cases extremely close to theoretical optimum. The width
of the estimator variance is inversely proportional to SNR
and transmission power, and thus the largest improvements
in comparison to binary phase codes can be found for short
transmission codes and poor SNR values. For good SNR
levels and longer codes, the improvement is not as dramatic.

have Doppler, and thus the performance of these codes in

Fig. 6. The best polyphase code with R = 0.974, L = 9. This code also has exceptionally high merit factor of 25.6. It is evident from the ACF, that this is
nearly the most optimal code possible for a code with unit norm amplitudes, as the outermost extremes of a single pulse have to be 1. The phases in degrees
are: 0, 0.2, 52.4, 41.7, −91.1, −144.5, 39.8, 161.4, −25.1.

the presence of Doppler is not known. The next logical step
would be to study estimation of targets with Doppler. In these
cases the optimal transmission codes may be different. We
only studied the performance of two natural and commonly
used linear target power estimators. A more superior method
would be to study target estimation as a statistical problem,
selecting codes that minimize the posterior distribution of the
target variable, given the measurements and prior information
about the target.

We present a new formalism to obtain momentum distributions in condensed matter from Neutron
Compton Proﬁles measured by the Deep Inelastic Neutron Scattering technique. The formalism
describes exactly the Neutron Compton Proﬁles as an integral in the momentum variable y. As
a result we obtain a Volterra equation of the ﬁrst kind that relates the experimentally measured
magnitude with the momentum distributions of the nuclei in the sample. The integration kernel
is related with the incident neutron spectrum, the total cross section of the ﬁlter analyzer and the
detectors eﬃciency function. A comparison of the present formalism with the customarily employed
approximation based on a convolution of the momentum distribution with a resolution function is
presented. We describe the inaccuracies that the use of this approximation produces, and propose
a new data treatment procedure based on the present formalism.

I.

INTRODUCTION

During the last decades there has been a growing in-
terest in the experimental determination of momentum
distributions of diﬀerent particles in a wide variety of
systems, being of principal importance the experiments
based on deep-inelastic scattering techniques. Thus, the
Compton scattering of x rays, gamma rays, and electrons
has been for a long time used to obtain the electron mo-
mentum distribution in condensed matter, the momen-
tum distributions of nucleons in nuclei have been deter-
mined by inelastic scattering of high-energy protons and
electrons, and the deep inelastic scattering of electrons,
muons and neutrinos was essential for establishing the
quark model of the nucleons1,2.

The experimental determination of atomic momentum
distribution in condensed matter making use of diﬀer-
ent neutron techniques has experienced a considerable
evolution up to the present times. An historical review
of these neutron experimental techniques has been pre-
sented in Ref. 3. Notably, the Deep Inelastic Neutron
Scattering (DINS) technique, proposed by Hohenberg
and Platzmann4 nearly 40 years ago for the study of the
Bose condensation in superﬂuid 4He, attained a consid-
erable experimental development. The technique proved
to be remarkably adequate to explore the momentum
distributions of the nuclei in condensed matter5,6, and
its development continues nowadays7,8. Being it a tech-
nique based on large momentum and energy transfers,
the interpretation of the recorded spectra is based on
the validity of the Impulse Approximation (IA), where
it is assumed that the target particle recoils freely after
the collision with the incident particle9, assuming that
the binding energy of the target nuclei is negligible com-
pared with the energy transferred by the neutron to the
target nuclei4,9,10. The justiﬁcation of the validity of the
IA in DINS experiments can be found in Refs. 11 and
12, while the deviations either due to ﬁnal-state eﬀects
(FSE)1,13,14,15,16, or to initial-state eﬀects (ISE)17 were

extensively treated. The IA allows a direct relation of the
scattering law with the momentum distribution function,
making use of the variable y, which is the projection of
the initial impulse of the target nuclei over the direction
of the momentum transfer vector q, through a process
known as y-scaling1,17.

On the other hand, the reactor based techniques for
the measurement of atomic momentum distributions (de-
veloped before DINS) have employed triple-axis crystal
spectrometers, magnetically pulsed beams, or rotating
crystal and chopper time-of-ﬂight spectrometers3. Since
these techniques employ neutrons with incident energies
restricted to the thermal range, they do not satisfy the
IA and therefore sophisticated corrections by FSE be-
come essential before the momentum distribution can be
obtained. The advent of high epithermal neutron ﬂuxes
available from intense pulsed spallation sources, placed
the DINS technique as the most suitable one for the study
of momentum distributions of nuclei constituting the con-
densed matter.

A common practice in the data treatment of the DINS
experiments is to employ a convolution approximation
(CA)8,18,19, where it is assumed that the observed spec-
trum in the time-of-ﬂight scale can be expressed as a
convolution in the variable y of the momentum distribu-
tion, with a mass-dependent ad hoc resolution function
devised to take into account the experimental uncertain-
ties along with the resonant ﬁlter energy width. However,
the accuracy of this procedure has been questioned by us
in previous papers20,21. The criticisms rested on the fact
that the expression of the CA is not directly deducible
from the exact one. When we tested it against the exact
expression we observed inaccurate results for the peak po-
sitions, areas and shapes of the observed proﬁles, and the
eﬀects were more noticeable when treating light nuclei.
As a consequence, a noteworthy result of DINS reported
on H2O/D2O mixtures22, that reported to have found an
anomalous behavior in the neutron cross sections, was
critically analyzed from the point of view of the accuracy

of the CA. A careful analysis lead us to conclude20,21 that
the inaccuracies committed in the CA produce anomalies
in the same sense as reported. Later measurements per-
formed by transmission on H2O/D2O mixtures23, showed
no traces of anomalous neutron cross sections. Further-
more, on the theoretical side, recent publications cast
doubts on the existence of anomalous phenomena24,25.
The controversial situation increases the need to revise
the procedures on which the CA is based.

Besides the mentioned limitations, there is another im-
portant unsatisfactory feature of the CA, that will be
treated in the present paper: in the CA only a single ﬁnal
energy corresponding to the peak of the resonant ﬁlter is
considered when the transformation from time-of-ﬂight
to the y scale is performed. However, as was remarked
in a recent analysis26, the ﬁnal energies of the scattered
neutrons are not restricted to a narrow resonant-ﬁlter line
width, but to a broader energy distribution determined
by the kinematics, the dynamics and the full total cross
section of the ﬁlter. The contributions of detected neu-
trons with ﬁnal energies outside the main resonance peak
cannot be neglected and in some cases become dominant.
The motivation of the this paper is to expose the de-
tails of the exact treatment that must be performed on
in view of the inconve-
the DINS experimental data,
niences that stem from the mentioned weakness of the
CA. We reformulate the basic equations that describe the
neutron Compton proﬁles starting from the exact expres-
sions as was previously treated20. As a result, explicit in-
tegrals in the variable y are obtained. The passage from
the time-of-ﬂight variable t to y is presented in its ex-
act form, and the ﬁnal expression results in a Volterra
equation of the ﬁrst kind, which can be solved for the
momentum distribution J(y). The results of the present
formalism, which is essentially exact are compared with
those produced by the CA. We stress on the imperfec-
tions that it generates and how those problems are solved

2

by employing the present formalism. The expressions we
present are amenable for the use of the experimental-
ists, and we recommend them to replace the currently
employed formalism in the data analysis of DINS exper-
iments.

II. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

A. Preliminary considerations

In this section we will present a brief summary of the
basic equations that will be employed throughout this
paper for describing the observed spectra in DINS experi-
ments. For a more complete theoretical development, the
reader is referred to Ref. 20. We will restrict our anal-
ysis to a standard inverse-geometry DINS experimental
setup18, in which incident neutrons with energy E0 (char-
acterized by the spectrum Φ(E0)) travel along a distance
L0 from the pulsed source to the sample. Scattered neu-
trons at an angle θ and a ﬁnal energy E travel along a
distance L1 up to the detector position. A movable ﬁlter
with a neutron absorption resonance in the eV-energy
region is placed in the scattered neutron path, so con-
secutive ‘ﬁlter in’ and ‘ﬁlter out’ measurements are per-
formed. The spectra are recorded as a function of the
total time of ﬂight t. Throughout this paper, we will ex-
plicitly omit the description of experimental uncertainties
due to geometry, time of ﬂight or multiple scattering. For
an account on these eﬀects the reader is referred to Refs.
19 and 28.

The measured magnitude (known as Neutron Compton
Proﬁle (NCP)) is the diﬀerence count rate (‘ﬁlter out’
minus ‘ﬁlter in’) as a function of t, which for a point-like
sample can be expressed as20

where σ(E0, E, θ) is the sample double-diﬀerential cross

gle subtended by the detector. The term between brack-
ets is the absorption probability of the resonant ﬁlter,
characterized by a number density n, a thickness T and
a total cross section σF (E). As indicated, the integral in
Eq. (1) must be calculated at a constant time-of-ﬂight t
given by the kinematic condition

the modulus of the transferred impulse. The DINS tech-
nique was developed on the theoretical basis of the IA, in
which the scattering law (for a monatomic sample) can
be written17

S(q, ω) =

J (eq, y) ,

where eq is the unit vector along the direction of q. The
variable y is the projection of the impulse p of the nucleus

J(eq, y)dy is deﬁned as the probability that a nucleus has
a momentum component along the direction of eq with
values between y and y + dy. The distribution J (eq, y)
must be symmetric around y = 0 if a moment in a given
direction of the space is equally probable than in its oppo-
site. For an isotropic sample J (eq, y) does not depend on
the direction given by eq, and then J(eq, y)dy = J(y)dy
is the probability that a nucleus of the sample has com-
ponent of momentum between y and y + dy along any
direction in the space. So, the dynamic structure factor
is reduced to

S(q, ω) =

J (y) .

where E1 is ﬁxed, deﬁned by the energy of the main ab-
sorption peak in the ﬁlter total cross section. The sum
has the same meaning as in Eq. (9), and a resolution
function R(˜yM ) is introduced as a way to contain the ge-
ometric uncertainties as well as the ﬁlter resonance width.
It is worth to emphasize that that in Eq. (10), the re-
lation between the variable ˜yM and t is made through
Eq. (7), where q and ω are calculated also with the same
E1 ﬁxed, and E0 compatible with the time-of-ﬂight rela-
tion (2). Also, it must be noticed that the term between
square brackets in Eq. (11) is independent of the sample
characteristics.

It is important to notice that the resolution function
in the CA framework is deducible from Eq. (10) and Eq.
(1) considering a sample represented by an ideal gas in

(12)

When geometric uncertainties are considered, they also
contribute to the width of RM , but as we have already
mentioned, this case will not be analyzed in the present
paper. It is worth to comment that in common practice
Eq. (12) is not employed, but instead a ﬁtted Lorentzian
(for Gold ﬁlters) or Gaussian function (for Uranium) in
the variable y are employed6,8.

III. FORMULATION OF THE EXACT
EXPRESSION

As it was commented, Eq. (10) can not be deduced
from the exact expression (1) and therefore its applica-
tion can not be fully justiﬁed. On the other hand an
expression where (like in (10)) the y variable appears ex-
plicitly, is desirable since it is the natural variable of the
impulse distribution J(y). In this section we will deduce
such exact expression that keeps y as the integration vari-
able. To this end, we will change the integration variable
from E0 to y in Eq. (1). In the ﬁrst step we rewrite Eq.
(7) in terms of E, E0 and θ as

yM =

(13)
At a given time of ﬂight t, E0 and E are linked through
Eq.
(2). Therefore, at a scattering angle θ, yM is a
function of E0 and t. On the other hand it must be
noticed that E0 can be a multi-valuated function of yM .
There is a substantial diﬀerence between this deﬁnition of
yM and that employed in the CA (Sect. II B), called ˜yM .
In the present deﬁnition yM is a function of E0 for each
considered time of ﬂight, while in the former deﬁnition
˜yM takes one value for each t.

To proceed with the variable change, we ﬁrst study the

To perform the variable change from E0 to y in the in-

where the function y(E0) is monotonous. Therefore we
must obtain the E0 values (and its corresponding y val-
ues) where

(16)

Deﬁning the variables

(where the positive value of the square root is taken in
the deﬁnition of x), Eq. (16) can be reduced to a ﬁfth-
order polynomial in x, with real coeﬃcients. The sought
values of E0 are obtained from the roots of

Therefore, Eq.
(18) has at most ﬁve real roots and
at least one, and only the positive values have physical
sense. Let NR be the number of such roots (0

whose values will be labeled xj, and correspondingly Ej
0
and yM,j the roots in the E0- and y-scales respectively.
Now we can proceed to change the integration variable
from E0 to y in Eq. (1). To this end, the integration
range has to be partitioned in NR+1 intervals (Ej−1
0),
where the function yM (E0) is monotonous, which we will
identify as ‘branch j’ (where E0

Finally, for a sample containing NM atoms of mass M

Eqs. (21) and (22) are the central expressions of the
present paper, which are exact expressions, since they
were derived directly from Eq. (1) without any approx-
imation. Eq.
(21) is a Volterra equation of the ﬁrst
kind. To obtain J(y) from it, it is possible to resort to
numerical methods. Alternatively, if the function that
describes J(y) is known beforehand (or a plausible form
is assumed for it), it will be possible to obtain it from a
ﬁtting procedure. In this last case it will not be necessary
to change the integration variable to y. In the case where
the sample and/or detector dimensions are not negligible,
Eqs. (20-24) must be integrated also over the geometric
dimensions.

As it was already mentioned, the deﬁnition of yM em-
ployed in Eqs. (20-24) diﬀers from that employed in the
CA. It is worth to notice that while in the CA the resolu-
tion function is the same for every t (centered in ˜yM (t)),
in the present formalism, fM (yM , t) depends explicitly
on t.
It must be remarked that if the CA framework
were exact, Eqs. (10) and (21) would produce the same
NCP, for an arbitrary J(y). Thus, from a direct compar-
ison between Eqs. (24) and (10) the following relation
between the exact expression of fM (yM , t) and the reso-
lution function would be veriﬁed

ξ(t)RM (˜yM (t)

y) = fM (y, t)

−
where ξM (t) is a deﬁned in Eq. (11). However, the usu-
ally employed RM (yM ) does not verify expression (25),
as will be examined in the next section.

ism and in the CA framework. In the second part we will
analyze the behavior of the kernel fM (y, t) and we will
compare it with the resolution function employed in the
CA. In the third part we will analyze the consequence of
our analysis in a speciﬁc case. The starting result over

NCPs of hydrogen, deuterium (Sects.

The study of H and D will be based on ideal gases of
eﬀective temperatures of 115.22 and 80.11 meV respec-
tively, as described in Ref. [20]. Their NCPs are shown
in Fig. 1.

IV. DISCUSSION

A. Study of the variable yM

In this Section we will analyze diﬀerent aspects of the
formalism we are presenting, with especial emphasis on
the diﬀerences between the exact results and those ob-
tained in the CA framework. We will focus our attention
on scattering on H, D and 3He, since as we will show,
they are the most sensitive cases in normal experimen-
tal conditions. We will assume throughout detectors of
ideal eﬃciency ε(E) = 1. An incident neutron spectrum

We will begin our discussion by examining the behav-
ior of the yM variable as a function of the time of ﬂight.
In Fig. 2 we show its behavior according to Eq. (13) as
a function of the incident neutron energy E0 at diﬀerent
times of ﬂight, for the case of hydrogen (M/m=0.99862)
at θ =70˚. The behavior at the limits commented in

FIG. 2: (Color online) The impulse y as a function of the
incident energy E0 for A=0.99862. The exact calculations
(13) at the indicated times of ﬂight are
according to Eq.
compared with the calculation performed by assuming the
ﬁnal energy ﬁxed at 4.906 eV, which is the variable ˜y employed
in the CA framework

behavior of ˜yM according to the conditions normally em-
ployed in the CA framework (Sect. II B). The diﬀerences
between both ways to deﬁne y is evident: while in the ex-
act formalism there is a whole range of possible values of
y at each time of ﬂight (which is a function of E0), in
the CA there is only one value of y deﬁned at each t.
We observe the curves y(E0) in the exact formalism in-
tersects the one of the CA in two points. However at
each time of ﬂight there is only one value of y deﬁned in
the CA framework. Thus, only one of those two points
over the exact y-curve has a ﬁnal energy corresponding
to that of the ﬁlter (4.906 eV), while the other has the
same value of y and E0 but a diﬀerent E. At 85.22 µsec,
both points coincide so the curves are tangent. At times
of ﬂight greater than 85.22 µsec, this property is found
in the intersection of the leftmost point between both
curves, while at times lower than 85.22 µsec we ﬁnd it in
the rightmost intersection point.

The behaviors observed in Fig.

2 are clariﬁed in

constant-y and constant-t curves, for the case of hydro-
gen. In Appendix B we show the details for the calcula-
tion of the constant y curves. We also show the constant-
E line corresponding to main peak absorption energy of
the gold analyzer (E=4.906 eV). The intersection of a
constant-t curve with the 4.906 eV-line deﬁnes an E0-
value with which the y-value in the CA framework is
calculated. It can be easily shown that in this case for
each constant-t curve, there is one (and only one) tangent
constant-y curve. The geometric loci of the tangency
points in the (E0, E)-plane result to be straight lines
(which will be called limit lines (LL) hereafter) whose
slopes can be obtained from the real positive roots of

Eq. (18). Bearing in mind Eq. (17) those slopes are the
squares of such roots. In this particular case of hydro-

= 0 has only one real root, which deﬁnes

the line E = 0.021E0 as the sought geometric locus of
the tangency points, which is represented in Fig. 3(b).
In the representation of Fig. 2 this corresponds to the
geometric locus of the maxima of the y(E0) curves. It is
worth to point out that the consequence of having one
real root in Eq. (18) is that there are two branches, so
NR = 1 in Eq. (21). In Fig. 3(b) we show a detail of the
upper frame. The line E = 0.021E0 intersects the con-
stant E = 4.906eV at a point corresponding to t =74.91
µsec and y = 9.73 ˚A−1. In consequence, in Fig. 2 the
intersection between ˜y and the curve of 74.91 µsec oc-
curs at its maximum. The importance of the LL resides
in that it indicates the y values where fM (y, t) presents
singularities, and will be commented in the next section.

FIG. 4: (Color online) The open symbols indicate value of
the slopes of the straight lines corresponding to the geometric
loci of the tangency points between constant-t and constant-
y curves in the (E, E0)-plane as a function of the scattering
angle, for H, D and O, with a ﬂight-paths ratio ℓ = 16.022.
Full symbols indicate the ratio E/E0 in the cold-gas limit for
H, D and O.

The slope of the LLs is a function of the scattering
angle and ℓ. This is shown in Fig. 4, for ℓ = 16.022. In
the case of hydrogen a LL can be deﬁned in the whole
angular range from 0˚ to 90˚ existing only one of such
LLs as already mentioned. On the other hand, for deu-
terium there exist two real positive solutions of Eq. (18)
below 39.7˚ and so two LLs, and for oxygen we observe
the same situation at a limit angle of 24.7˚.

It is also interesting to observe in Fig. 5 the represen-
tation in the (E0, E)-plane for deuterium at θ =35˚. In
this case there exist two LLs (in accordance with Fig. 4),
which are shown in the graph.

B. Kernel fM (yM , t)

Having established the behavior of the variable yM we
can now analyze Eq. (24). We are especially interested
in examining the kernel fM (yM , t). In Fig. 6 we show
its behavior in the case of scattering in hydrogen at 70˚
for diﬀerent times of ﬂight of interest in the Compton
proﬁle, as can be checked in Fig. 1. It is very impor-
tant to notice the asymptotic behavior of fM (yM , t) at
the values of yM deﬁned by the LL, that is understood

deﬁned in the CA framework. However, the asymptotes
present in the exact formulation mark important diﬀer-
ences between both formulations, which are clearly man-
ifested at 74.91 µsec, as showed in Fig. 6(b), where the
asymptote is exactly in ˜yM (t). This eﬀect is further illus-
trated in Fig. 7, where the asymptote position is shown
as a function of t together with ˜yM (t). Both curves are
tangent at 74.91 µsec. Alternatively, the interpretation
of this point can be understood from the inspection of
Fig. 3(b). In the (E0, E)-plane this point is the intersec-
tion between the LL and the E =4.906-eV line. On any
constant-t curve the maximum value of y occurs in its in-
tersection with the LL (point A), so in general this value
of y is greater than the one at its intersection with the
constant line E =4.906 eV (point B). But at the precise
time where both lines intersect points A and B coincide.
This is manifested in Fig. 7 where the y values of the
asymptote position are always greater than those of the
constant line E =4.906 eV except at the tangency point.
Besides the mentioned asymptotic behavior, there ex-
ist two other important features not described in the CA
framework, viz.
the main peak width and height de-
pends on t, at variance with the left hand side member
of Eq. (25). Similarly, those behaviors are observed in
deuterium (not shown in this paper).

literature29,30,31. The NCP corresponding to this system
can be obtained in the exact formalism with Eq. (21)
and is shown in Fig. 8(a) (circles), which corresponds
to a Gaussian distribution J(y) with a full-width-at-half-
maximum (FWHM) of 1.3151 ˚A−1. The geometry, the
ﬁlter and the eﬃciency are the same described at the be-
ginning of this section. The function J(y) is shown Fig.
8(b)(dotted line).

We now compare the exact formalism with the results
produced in the CA framework. The resolution function
can be obtained from the limit T
0K of the NCP
(shown in full line in Fig. 8(a)), and it is calculated in
Eq. (12), thus obtaining the R1(y) shown in Fig. 8(b)

its calculation was taken from Ref. 27. Following the
procedure already described20, Eq. (10) was employed

tions. For example, the change in FWHM from R3 to
R4 is 3.7 % and the resulting mean kinetic energies diﬀer
in 12.3 %. The reason for such a large change, was re-
ported in Ref. 20: at low temperatures the shape of the
observed NCP is determined mainly by the ﬁlter, so any
imperfection in the description of the ﬁlter eﬀects will
aﬀect signiﬁcantly the obtained mean kinetic energy.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we developed the exact formalism that
describes the NCPs obtained from DINS experiments in
terms of an integral equation in the variable y that in-
volves a kernel dependent on the experimental setup pa-
rameters. For its calculation, a precise knowledge of the
detectors eﬃciency, the ﬁlter total cross section and the
incident neutron spectrum in a wide range of energies is
required. As a result, we obtained a Volterra equation of

9

the ﬁrst kind that allows to obtain the desired momen-
tum distribution J(y) by means of numerical methods.

A signiﬁcant part of this paper was devoted to the
study of the variable y, that in the exact formalism here
presented has a deﬁnition that diﬀers signiﬁcantly from
that employed in the CA framework. The physical sig-
niﬁcance of this variable is the projection of the initial
impulse of the target nuclei over the direction of the mo-
mentum transfer vector q. In DINS data processing pro-
cedures the passage from t to y is customarily calculated
taking a ﬁxed ﬁnal energy, and thus it has a single well-
deﬁned value for each time channel. In this paper it was
calculated exactly. The importance of knowing the exact
mapping of the variable y in the (E0, E)-plane can be
referred to our recent study on the neutron ﬁnal energy
distributions in DINS experiments26.
In that work we
found that such distributions are far more complex than
considering a single ﬁnal energy, and depends on the time
channel and the dynamics of the scattering species. We
showed the constant-y curves on the (E0, E)-plane for
hydrogen and deuterium at a particular scattering angle
and ratio of ﬂight paths, which served to illustrate its be-
havior, and developed its general expressions. A notice-
able particularity of the y variable in the exact treatment
that we present in this paper, is that it can have local
extrema as a function of E0 for a given time of ﬂight
as shown in Fig. 2, which deﬁne straight lines in the
(E0, E)-plane (LL). This causes singularities in the Ja-
cobian dE0/dyM which aﬀect the kernel fM (yM , t). For
example in the analyzed case of hydrogen, values of y
greater that that those deﬁned by the LL are not physi-
cally allowed.

In past publications20,21 we showed that CA can not
be deduced from the exact expression. In this paper we
again showed that the CA formalism is incompatible with
the exact one, and that the basis of the diﬀerence between
both formalisms resides in the integration kernels. Thus,
the resolution function must be replaced by a kernel that
depends on t. In Fig. 6 we show explicitly the diﬀerences
between the exact kernel and the commonly accepted res-
olution function. Besides the clearly observed diﬀerences
in shape, it is notable the appearance of the above men-
tioned singularities.
In the particular case analyzed in
this paper these discrepancies are particularly noticeable
at 74.91 µsec, where the singularity occurs exactly at the
value of y where the maximum of the resolution function
is centered, i.e. at y = ˜yM (t).

So far, we have focussed our discussion on the diﬀer-
ences between the kernel fM (yM , t) and the resolution
function, without making any reference to the momen-
tum distribution of the sample JM (yM ). As a ﬁrst exam
on the interrelation between fM (yM , t) and JM (yM ) it is
helpful to check to what extent the singularity can aﬀect
signiﬁcant parts of the integrand (21). To this end we
will compare the ratio E/E0 where the singularities ap-
pear (deﬁned by the slope of the LL) with the same ratio
for the scattering on a sample deﬁned by an ideal gas at

Eq. (26) deﬁnes also the most probable energy ratio in
the case of a sample at ﬁnite temperature. In Fig. 4 we
show in open symbols the ratio E/E0 of the LL for H,
D and O, and in full symbols that corresponding to Eq.
(26), as a function of the scattering angle. We observe
that for this particular value of ℓ the singularities do not
appear signiﬁcantly near the main peak. However, due to
the thermal motion (described by the shape of J(y)) the
singularities aﬀect the description of the tails of NCPs.
The present formalism was formulated regardless of the
function J(y). Although in this paper the case of an
isotropic sample was examined, all the considerations we
developed are applicable also for the case of anisotropic
samples. It is also worth to notice that although in most
of the signiﬁcant cases concerning the study of Con-
densed Matter the function J(y) is closely represented
by a Gaussian shape17, this function could represent
an anisotropic momentum distribution, not centered in
y = 0 like in the case of particles ﬂowing in a prefer-
ential direction. With regard to the analysis of experi-
ments where the sample can be represented by the usual
Gaussian distributions, it must be emphasized that the
eﬀects of the singularities will normally be smoothed out
in the NCP, i.e.
the experimentally accessible magni-
tude. However, the diﬀerences between the exact for-
malism and the CA in the description of the NCP are
clearly manifested, as accounted in detail in Ref. 20, so
we will brieﬂy summarize them here. A comparison of
the results produced by Eq. (10) in the calculation of
the NCPs, with the exact formalism represented either
by Eqs. (1) or (20) (both formulations are equivalent,
since they diﬀer only in the integration variable), reveal
that the CA is defective in the description of

the peak areas,

the peak centroids,

being the case of light scatterers at low temperatures
the most sensitive ones to these imperfections.
In this
case the widths of the momentum distribution function
J(y), and the resolution function R(y) becomes compara-
ble, and thus the consequences of the diﬀerences between
R(y) and the exact kernel is more clearly manifested on
the NCPs. Thus, the obtainment of peak areas and eﬀec-
tive temperatures is signiﬁcantly aﬀected because of the
use of the CA. The analysis shown in Sect. IV C, clearly
reﬂects this assertion, and the inadequacy to employ res-
olution functions (either theoretically or experimentally
deﬁned) that due to the approximate nature of the CA
has an unavoidable degree of ambiguity in its deﬁnition.

We wish to conclude this paper giving a schematic out-
line of the procedure we recommend to use to the exper-
imentalists in the DINS ﬁeld. For the measurement of
an impulse distribution function it is necessary to char-
acterize diﬀerent parameters of the experimental conﬁg-
uration.

1. The incident neutron energy spectrum can be de-
termined by a measurement with a detector of well-
characterized eﬃciency placed on the direct beam.

2. The eﬃciency of the detectors bank can be charac-
terized using a heavy target (like Pb or Bi) at the
sample position (with the ﬁlter out of the scattered
neutron path).

3. The eﬀective ﬁlter thickness can be measured with
a lead target, employing the method ‘ﬁlter in - ﬁlter
out’, and ﬁtting it as a parameter in Eq. (1). Al-
ternatively, a transmission experiment can be per-
formed on the direct beam. In the process, the full
total cross section of the ﬁlter is needed. A wide
variety of cross sections can be found v. gr. in Ref.
27.

4. Experimental data must be corrected by multi-
ple scattering and attenuation eﬀects, using Monte
Carlo procedures like those described in Refs. 19
and 28.

5. From the steps 1 to 3, which aim to know the kernel
f (y, t), and step 4 which corrects for ﬁnite sample
eﬀects, we obtain the necessary elements to state
Eq. (21), that can be solved either by numerical
means or by ﬁtting parameters if we have a pre-
vious knowledge of the function J(y). In this last
instance the ﬁtting process can be made also di-
rectly on the t scale employing Eq.
(1) without
changing the integration variable from E0 to y.

Finally, let us mention that the present formalism is
also applicable to the method of double diﬀerences re-
cently presented32, which consists in employing two ﬁl-
ters of diﬀerent thicknesses. The use of the formalism
presented in our paper will be most beneﬁcial for the
users community of these DINS techniques.

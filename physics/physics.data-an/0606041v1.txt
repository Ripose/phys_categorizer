Using the correlation matrix formalism we study the temporal aspects
of the Warsaw Stock Market evolution as represented by the WIG20 index.
The high frequency (1 min) WIG20 recordings over the time period between
January 2001 and October 2005 are used. The entries of the correlation ma-
trix considered here connect diﬀerent distinct periods of the stock market
dynamics, like days or weeks. Such a methodology allows to decompose the
price ﬂuctuations into the orthogonal eigensignals that quantify diﬀerent
modes of the underlying dynamics. The magnitudes of the corresponding
eigenvalues reﬂect the strengths of such modes. One observation made in
this paper is that strength of the daily trend in the WIG20 dynamics sys-
tematically decreases when going from 2001 to 2005. Another is that large
events in the return ﬂuctuations are primarily associated with a few most
collective eigensignals.

1. Introduction

Nature of the temporal correlations in ﬁnancial ﬂuctuations constitutes
one of the most fascinating issues of the contemporary physics. The pure
Brownian-type motion [1] is deﬁnitely not an optimal reference [2]. Already
the correlations in the ﬁnancial volatility remain positive over a very long
time horizon [3]. Even more involved are higher order correlations that give
rise to the ﬁnancial multifractality [4].
In this context a mention should
also be given to the concept of ﬁnancial log-periodicity - a phenomenon
analogous to criticality in the discrete scale invariant version [5, 6].

One more approach, initiated in Ref. [7], to quantify the character of
ﬁnancial time-correlations [8] is to use a variant of the correlation matrix.

In this approach the entries of the corresponding matrix connect the high-
frequency time series of returns representing diﬀerent disconnected time-
intervals like the consecutive days or weeks. The structure of eigenvectors
of such a matrix allows then to quantify several characteristics of time cor-
relations that remain unvisible by more conventional methods.

Using this methodology here we present a systematic study for the Pol-
ish stock market index WIG20 over the period 02.01.2001-31.10.2005. The
corresponding WIG20 chart, expressed both in terms of the Polish Zloty
(PLN) and in terms of the US$, versus two world leading stock market in-
dices: the Nasdaq and the S&P500, is shown in Fig. 1. The Warsaw Stock
Exchange trading time during this period was 10:00-16:10 and the WIG20
recorded with the frequency of 1 min.

2. Formalism

In the present study the correlation matrix is thus deﬁned as follows.
To each element in a certain sequence N of relatively long consecutive time-
intervals of equal length K labeled with α one uniquely assigns a time series
xα(ti), where ti (i = 1, 2, ..., K) is to be understood as discrete time counted
from the beginning for each α. In the ﬁnancial application xα(ti) is going
to represent the price time-series, α the consecutive trading days (or weeks)
and ti the trading time during the day (week). As usual it is then natural

3

(1)

(2)

to deﬁne the returns Rα(ti) time-series as Rα(ti) = ln xα(ti + τ )
where τ is the time lag. The normalized returns are deﬁned by

−

ln xα(ti),

rα(ti) =

Rα(ti)
t
i

− h
v

R2
h

where v is the standard deviation of returns over the period T and v2 =
σ2(Rα) =

h
One thus obtains N time series rα(ti) (α = 1, ..., N ) of length T =K-1,
T matrix M. Then, the correlation matrix is deﬁned as C =
i.e. an N
(1/T ) MMT. By diagonalizing C

Cvk = λkvk,

one obtains the eigenvalues λk (k = 1, ..., N ) and the corresponding eigen-
vectors vk =

density of eigenvalues ρC(λ) is known analytically [9, 10], and reads

variance of the time series (unity in our case).
For a better visualization, each eigenvector can be associated with the cor-
responding time series of returns by the following expression:

These new time series thus decompose the return ﬂuctuations into the or-
thogonal components that reﬂect distinct patterns of oscillations common
to all the time intervals labeled with α. They are therefore called the
eigensignals [7, 8].

3. Results

3.1. Correlations among trading days

The above methodology is here applied to the WIG20 1 min recordings
during the period between January 02, 2001 and October 31, 2005. This
whole time period is split and analysed separately for the consecutive calen-
dar years
). The number

NY of trading days correspondingly equals 249, 243, 249, 255, and 210. The
WIG20 intraday variation is systematically taken between the trading time

black lines) calculated for WIG20(Warsaw Stock Exchange) index over the ﬁve
consecutive calendar years. The noise range, as determined by a random Wishart
matrix with Q = 368/NY, is indicated by the shaded ﬁeld.

The structure of eigenspectrum λY

k of such matrices for all the ﬁve calen-
dar years is shown in Fig. 2. The pure noise range - as prescribed (Eq. (3))
by the corresponding Wishart ensemble of random matices [9, 10] - is in-
dicated by the shaded area. As one can see, the majority of eigenvalues of
our empirical correlation matrices are located within this area which signals
that noise is dominating. Typically there exist however several eigenvalues
that stay signiﬁcantly above it. They are associated with some collectivity
eﬀects that in the present case are to be interpreted as an appearance of
certain repeatable structures in the intraday dynamics of ﬁnancial ﬂuctua-
tions. Deﬁnitely one such structure is the daily trend. As far as the WIG20
dynamics is concerned it is however even more interesting to see that when

5

going from 2001 to 2005 those large eigenvalues gradually decrease and get
closer to the noise area. This eﬀect is more systematically documented
in Fig. 3 which shows the evolution of the four largest eigenvalues of the
N
250 correlation matrix, which corresponds to 250 consecutive
trading days, and this time window is moved with a step of one month (20
trading days).

N = 250

The structure of eigenspectrum is expected to be closely related to the
distribution of matrix elements of the correlation matrices. For the same
ﬁve calendar years as in Fig. 2 the corresponding distributions are shown
in Fig. 4 versus their Gaussian best ﬁts. Indeed, in 2001 this distribution
deviates most from a Gaussian and even develops a power-law tail with the
x−γ). It is in this case that the largest eigenvalue
slope of γ
of the correlation matrix is repelled most (upper most left panel of Fig. 2)
from the rest of the spectrum due to an eﬀective reduction of the rank of the
matrix [11]. Later on the distribution of the matrix elements is much better
ﬁt by a Gaussian and some deviations remain on the level of essentially
single entries.

An optimal way to visualize the character of repeatable intraday struc-
tures is to look at the eigensignals as deﬁned by the Eq. (4). They can
be calculated for all the eigenvectors. An explicit numerical veriﬁcation
conﬁrms that they are orthogonal indeed, i.e., the correlation matrix con-
structed out of them is diagonal.

Interestingly, an analogous enhancement before closing as observed [8]
for the other markets, in case of the WIG20 can be seen only rudimentary.

For comparison one typical eigensignal (z200(tj)) corresponding to the bulk
of eigenspectrum is shown in the bottom of Fig. 5. Its amplitude of oscil-
lations can be seen to be about an order of magnitude smaller than for the
previous leading eigensignals.

3.2. Correlations among trading weeks

Ability of the above formalism to detect and decompose some potential
repeatable structures in the ﬁnancial patterns prompts a question of correla-
tions among diﬀerent trading weeks. Our WIG20 data set (Fig. 1) comprises
N = 207 full trading weeks and thus allows to construct a 207
207 cor-
relation matrix. The lengths T of the corresponding time series of 1 min
returns between monday opening and friday closing equals 1840. The upper

Fig. 7. Cumulative distributions of the moduli of normalised intraweek eigensignals.
Dashed line corresponds to a Gaussian distribution and the solid line indicates a
slope corresponding to the inverse cubic power-law.

eigensignal associated with the largest eigenvalue (λ1) is shown in the lower
panel of this Figure. It shows an enhanced market activity at the connec-
tions between the days. Interestingly however this activity is much stronger
in the middle of the week than in its beginning or in the end.

Finally, such a decomposition of ﬁnancial ﬂuctuations allows an instruc-
tive insight into the statistics of returns distributions. This in itself consti-
tutes one of the central issues of econophysics. The related well identiﬁed
stylized fact is the so-called inverse cubic power-law [12, 13, 14]. There exist
also some consistency arguments that favor this law [15]. Fig. 7 shows the
cumulative return distributions associated with several weekly eigensignals.
Those distributions that originate from the bulk of eigenspectrum can be
seen not to deviate much from a Gaussian even for such a short time lag
of 1 min. The fatter tails result from the ﬂuctuations ﬁltered out by the
eigensignals connected with the largest eigenvalues. In particular, the most
extreme events can be seen in the ﬁrst eigensignal, the one whose main
component constitute ﬂuctuations commonly considered a daily or a weekly
trend.

4. Summary

The way of using the correlation matrix formalism, as presented here,
opens a promissing novel window to view the character of ﬁnancial ﬂuctu-

10

ations. In particular the related concept of eigensignals allows to ﬁlter out
all repeatable synchronous patterns in the market daily or weekly activity.
They are connected with a few largest eigenvalues of the corresponding cor-
relation matrix. It is those eigensignals that appear to be responsible for the
fat tails in the return distributions. The overwhelming rest of the spectrum
stays within the borders prescribed by the random ensemble of Wishart ma-
trices and ﬂuctuations of the corresponding eigensignals are essentially of
the Gaussian type. As far as the WIG20 dynamics is concerned it is inter-
esting to notice a gradual weakening of the daily trend eﬀects when going
from 2001 to 2005. A question remains whether this eﬀect is characteristic
to this speciﬁc market or it takes place in the other markets as well.

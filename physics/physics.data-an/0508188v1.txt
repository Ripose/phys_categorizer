Abstract

Using data from a sample of 28 representatives countries, we propose a classiﬁcation of currency

crises consequences based on the ultrametric analysis of the real exchange rate movements time

series, without any further assumption. By using the matrix of synchronous linear correlation co-

eﬃcients and the appropriate metric distance between pairs of countries, we were able to construct

a hierarchical tree of countries. This economic taxonomy provides relevant information regarding

liaisons between countries and a meaningful insight about the contagion phenomenon.

INTRODUCTION

Prediction and contagion of ﬁnancial crises have received much attention in recent years.

The ﬁnancial instability during the nineties has caused intense exchange and banking crises,

in developed and, especially, in developing countries. Most of the empirical literature has

focused their interest in identiﬁcation, prediction and contagion of currency crises, and the

macroeconomic variable which seems to better account for both eﬀects is the real exchange

rate (RER) [1, 2, 3, 4]. However, conclusive results from the empirical literature are hard

to achieve. One of the reason for unconvincing answers in this debate is the enormous

diﬀerences in periods and countries used in the empirical works, without taking account

for regional or country speciﬁc diﬀerences in the underlying dynamics of the variables time

series used [5] [4].

From a methodological point of view, techniques and tools formerly used in the physical

and biological ﬁelds, have become to be applied in the analysis of economic data [6, 7],

in particular, to the case of stock portfolios. In this case, correlation based clustering of

synchronous ﬁnancial data has been performed to obtain a taxonomy of a set stocks from

the US equity market. The last objective in this kind of works is to improve economic

forecasting and modeling the complex dynamic underlying the raw data and their basic

hypothesis is that ﬁnancial time series are carrying valuable economic information that can

be detected.

Following the above ideas, we shall extract information present in the correlation matrix

of the RER in a sample of 28 representative countries, in the period of 1990-2002. By using

the subdominant ultrametric associate with a metric distance in the correlation space, we

ﬁrst construct the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) which provides a topological picture

of the countries links. Then, we shall proceed to construct a hierarchical tree associated

with the distance matrix in order to obtain a country taxonomic description provided by

the real exchange data. So, the main aim of this work is to detect hierarchical structure

of our country sample that arises from the relations links in their exchange rate dynamics.

Clustering countries in such a way could be of importance in several economic aspects related

to the empirical currency crises and contagion literature. Probably the most important is the

identiﬁcation of homogenous countries in their exchange rate dynamics in order to construct

better regional Early Warning Systems (EWS), more accurate forms of dating the events

2

of crises especially design for homogeneous regions (or isolated countries) and, ﬁnally, for

understanding the possibilities of forecasting of contagion.

II. METHODOLOGY

A. Data

Returns from RER in each of the 28 time series has been calculated in the usual way,

rRERi(k) =

RERi(k + 1) − RERi(k)
RERi(k)

(1)

where RERi(k) is the monthly real exchange rate from country i, at month k, and rRERi(k)

the corresponding return. The period 1990-2002 has been used, yielding a total of 156 data

points for each country. Figure (1) shows the actual time series used for further calculations.

RER is computed as the ratio of foreign price proxied by U.S. consumer price to domestic

consumer price, and the result is multiplied by the nominal exchange rate of the domestic

currency with U.S. dollar. Data has been drawn from International Financial Statistics in

the IMF database available on-line (http://ifs.apdi.net/imf/logon.aspx).

B. Numerical Methods

In order to quantify the degree of similarity between pairs of RER time series belonging

to diﬀerent countries, we have calculated the Pearson correlation coeﬃcient [10]

ρi,j =

P

qP

N
k=1(rRERi(k)− < rRERi >)(rRERj(k)− < rRERj >)

N
k=1 (rRERi(k)− < rRERi >)

N
k=1 (rRERj(k)− < rRERj >)

2

2

qP

(2)

where < rRERi > is the mean value of rRERi in the period considered. Because ρi,j is a

measure of similarity, and a measure of ”distance” is actually needed in order to construct

the ultrametirc space [11], following Gower [9], we deﬁne the distance between the time

evolution of rRERi and rRERj as,

d(i, j) = qρi,i + ρj,j − 2ρi,j = q2(1 − ρi,j)

(3)

The last equality came from the symetry property of the correlation matrix, ρi,j = ρj,i and

the normalization ρi,i = 1 ∀i. In this way, di,j fulﬁls the three axioms of a distance:

FIG. 1: Returns of real exchange rate time series in the 28 countries. Countries are ordered

alphabetically from bottom to top. Monthly data from January 1990 to December 2002 has been

used. Countries are labeled accordingly with the symbols listed in the Appendix.

• d(i, j) = 0 if and only if i = j

• d(i, j) = d(j, i)

• d(i, j) ≤ d(i, l) + d(l, j)

The third axiom, the triangular inequality, characterize a metric space. An ultrametric

space, on the other hand, is endowed with a distance that obeys a stronger inequality, the

ultrametric distance d(i, j)<:

d(i, j)< ≤ max{d(i, l), d(l, j)}

(4)

Thus, it follows that the distance matrix given by Equation (3) satisﬁes ultrametricity and

a hierarchical tree can be uniquely constructed [11].

One method to obtain d(i, j)< directly from the distance matrix d(i, j) is through the

MST method [11]. Given the metric space (Ω, d), that is, countries and the distance deﬁned

by Equation (3), there is associated with this space a nondirected graph with the same

4

elements of Ω as vertices, and links between the elements (i, j), the distances d(i, j). The

MST is a tree with the same vertices as in Ω but of minimal total lenght. Although more

than one MST can be constructed on Ω, d< is unique. With the information provided by

the MST, the distance d(i, j)< between two elements i and j in Ω is given by

d(i, j)< = max{d(wi, wi+1), 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1}

(5)

where Ci,j = {(w1, w2), (w2, w3), ..., (wn−1, wn)} denotes the unique path in the MST between
i and j (w1 = i, wn = j). We shall show in the next section how to construct d(i, j)< in our

In what follows, we shall follow closely the analysis and methodology done in the work of

R. Mantegna [8] in the case of stocks. A comprehensive review of ultrametricity, hierarchical

trees and clustering methods can be found in reference [11]

particular case.

III. RESULTS

We ﬁrst construct the MST directly from the distance matrix d(i, j). One begins by

connecting the closest countries given by d(i, j), in this case POR-SPA with a distance

equal to 0.41. Table I shows some representative distances. One then proceeds by linking the

remaining countries accordingly with their closeness to the previously connected countries.

For instance, in the distance matrix, the shortest distance following POR-SPA is DEN-SWI

with a distance of 0.411, and in this way, we have another link between both countries.

The next one is DEN-GRE with a distance of 0.464. We then proceed to connect GRE to

the former pair DEN-SWI, giving GRE-DEN-SWI. At this moment, we have two ”clusters”,

POR-SPA and GRE-DEN-SWI. Proceeding in the above explained way, we ﬁnally construct

a tree with the 28 countries and 27 links among them. Figure (2) shows the complete MST

given by the distance matrix d(i, j).

Armed with the information provided by the distance matrix d(i, j) and the MST, we

proceed to construct the subdominant ultrametric, accordingly with Equation (5). Firstly,
we deﬁne the subdominant ultrametric distance matrix D<. This ultrametric matrix is

obtained by deﬁning the subdominant ultrametric distance d(i, j)< between countries i and

j, as the maximum value of the distance d(k, l) detected by moving, in single steps, from

country i to country j through the shortest path connecting i and j in the MST (Equation

5). For instance, the ultrametric distance d(SP A, P OR)< = 0.410 because both countries

are placed side by side in the MST, and in this way, the ultrametric distance coincide

with the metric distance, however, d(SW I, SP A)< = 0.490, which is the maximum metric

distance between adjacent countries in the path from SWI to SPA (see Figure 2 and Table 1).

Proceeding in this way, we then order countries accordingly with their ultrametric distances

to the others, placing the more tightly connected countries in the center, and outward the

less connected.

In order to obtain a clear picture of the distances between countries, we

have plotted in Figure (3) the distance matrix given by Equation (3), but countries ordered

accordingly with their ultrametric distances.

In the MST three groups of countries are clearly seen. It is interesting to note that these

groups are built by geographical neighbor countries. EU countries group appears in ﬁrst

place with the smallest distances among them; Asian countries followed and in third place

Latin American countries have shown higher distances between their countries than the other

two ﬁrst groups. As expected, EU countries have shown the shortest distances in our sample

(distances between 0.41 and 0.76) due to common relative real exchange movements[12]

inside the European Monetary System[14], although two diﬀerent sub-groups of countries

shows up; one in the north, with DEN as the most linked country and the other one in the

south of Europe with short distances and intense links among SPA, POR and ITA. Finally,

FIN is the least connected country in this group and U K and IRE seem not to belong to

it. Correlations coeﬃcients in Figure (3) clearly support the closeness among EU countries

exchange rate dynamics based, of course, in the common policy they have followed.

Asian countries form the next group order by distance. By far, THA and MAL are the

most connected into the group (distances between 0,66 and 1) and are also quite connected

with the EU countries and AUS and U K (1, 05 < d < 1, 3). On the other side, KOR

and especially INDI form a relatively isolated pair and have shown little and less intense

connections with any of the groups.

Our third group is the Latin American one. Distances show high values (above 1,1) and

very diﬀuse connections so, in fact, it is not a homogeneous group. Interesting enough is the

important role played by BRA in South America as a centre of connections in this region.

In this sense, BRA is the ﬁrst link for ARG, CHI and COL showing the central role of

their exchange rate economic policy in the South American continent. (In Figure (3) the

correlation coeﬃcients show the same central role of BRA). On the other hand, ARG, PER,

ECU and VEN have shown relative isolated exchange rate dynamics in the analyzed period,

with no apparent relevant links in the region. The same occurs to MEX but in this case the

reason probably was their intense trade and ﬁnancial relations with the United States. In

Figure (3) we can see no apparent group formation in the region, except light correlations

in BRA.

ITA and SIN.

In this regional hierarchy there are countries with connections more ”diﬀuse”. For in-

stance, the U K shows small distances with the EU group (0,95) in ﬁrst term but also with

Asian countries and IRE and AUS. In the same direction, CHI shows short distance with

BRA (1,17) in ﬁrst time but immediately are AUS, COL, IRE, ECU and MAL. More iso-

lated is INDI with very diﬀuse connections and high distances (1,33), to KOR, U K, CHI,

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have introduced a new criterion to characterize the eﬀects of currency crises based

solely on the correlations of real exchange rate returns time series. By using the information

provided by the correlations between synchronous movements in the real exchange rates in

diﬀerent countries, we were able to construct a geometrical picture of the countries connec-

tions by means the MST. Moreover, taxonomic information is also extracted from the time

series, by ordering countries accordingly with its ultrametric distance (Figure 3).

The hierarchical structure has shown three groups of countries which are clearly divided in

a regional dimension. EU and Asian countries are relatively homogenous groups, meanwhile

Latin American countries form a heterogeneous region where Brazil exchange rate dynamics

is central. On the other side, we have shown a group of countries which do not belong to a

speciﬁc group, such us Chile, India or United Kingdom. From an economic point of view,

information of our hierarchical tree could be useful in three relevant aspects. First of all,

9

we would expect that countries or group of countries with short distances among them were

aﬀected commonly by the same, or almost the same, economic and non economic factors,

such as the EU group and in the central Asian group. When distances are larger among

countries, exchange rate dynamics are aﬀected by country speciﬁc factors.

In second place, information of our tree could be of interest for deﬁning diﬀerent methods

of dating a currency crises depending of the range of countries to be used in the empirical

analysis. So, this approach could improve results in dating a currency crises and also in

deﬁning the event of crises.

In the same direction, this taxonomy can be used to deﬁne

diﬀerent regional or individual Early Warning Systems.

In third place, the taxonomy associated with the obtained hierarchical structure might

be useful in the theoretical description of contagion and in the search of speciﬁc economic

and no economic factors aﬀecting diﬀerent groups of countries. In addition, this hierarchy

may be a useful tool in the analysis of exchange rate crises contagion.

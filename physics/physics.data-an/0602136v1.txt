Stochasticity of Road Traﬃc Dynamics:
Comprehensive Linear and Nonlinear Time Series Analysis on High Resolution
Freeway Traﬃc Records

Helge Siegel∗ and Denis Belomestnyi†
(Dated: February 2, 2008)

The dynamical properties of road traﬃc time series from North-Rhine Westphalian motorways are
investigated. The article shows that road traﬃc dynamics is well described as a persistent stochas-
tic process with two ﬁxed points representing the freeﬂow (non-congested) and the congested state
regime. These traﬃc states have diﬀerent statistical properties, with respect to waiting time distribu-
tion, velocity distribution and autocorrelation. Logdiﬀerences of velocity records reveal non-normal,
obviously leptocurtic distribution. Further, linear and nonlinear phase-plane based analysis methods
yield no evidence for any determinism or deterministic chaos to be involved in traﬃc dynamics on
shorter than diurnal time scales. Several Hurst-exponent estimators indicate long-range dependence
for the free ﬂow state.
Finally, our results are not in accordance to the typical heuristic ﬁngerprints of self-organized criti-
cality. We suggest the more simplistic assumption of a non-critical phase transition between freeﬂow
and congested traﬃc.

INTRODUCTION

Traﬃc ﬂow prediction, particularly in close connection
with the avoidance of jams, is a challenging, yet hitherto
unreached target.
Until now, due to restricted access to records, simu-
lation models provided the predominant approach to
understand traﬃc dynamics. Several approaches have
been developed which are based on partial diﬀerential
equations ([1],[2]), or cellular automata models as the
widespread Nagel-Schreckenberg model ([3]). A com-
prehensive overview of results from time series analysis
from real traﬃc records was published by [4]. In earlier
research on the database that our study relies on, diur-
nal, weekly and annual cycles in traﬃc density as well as
velocity was reported in details by [5]. Autocorrelation
and time-headways of traﬃc records are demonstrated
to vary state-dependently ([6],[7]), congested traﬃc
revealing a more persistant autocorrelation.

This paper is organized as follows: We ﬁrst intro-

ﬁc records by fundamental diagram and delay-plot, to
point up that traﬃc dynamics consist of two heteroge-
neous states. The further analysis focuses on separated

sections of either free ﬂow or congested traﬃc regimes.
We then turn to phase-plane based methods such as cor-
relation integrals, and surrogate based local linear pre-
dictions to demonstrate that traﬃc dynamics on below
diurnal time scales has a predominantly stochastic na-
ture.
Long-range dependence is tested from several measures.
To exclude possible eﬀects of nonstationarity, the latter
measure is compared with appropriate phase randomized
surrogates. Nonlinearity will be discussed by application
of the surrogate based time-reversibility test.

II. DATA ANALYSIS

A. Methods

1. Phase-randomized surrogates

In time series analysis, phase-randomized surrogate
(PRS) time series ([8]) can be applied as a version of
bootstrapping to clarify and quantify statements about
the presence of nonlinear eﬀects. PRS series reveal the
same linear statistical properties as their original and can
be produced at will. Possible nonlinearities, as nonlinear
determinism beyond the autocorrelation of the original
time series will not be reproduced by their surrogatiza-
tion, or changed by interpretation as a spectral property.
In summary, PRS time series are produced by multiply-
ing the Fourier-spectrum of the original records with ran-
dom phases and hereafter performing a backtransforma-
tion (for details see [9] or [10]).

2. Nonlinear methods

In this paper we will make use of linear and nonlinear
phase-plane based measures such as correlation dimen-
sion and local linear prediction. Such methods are usu-
ally applied to time series with the intention of identify-
ing the presence of nonlinear, possibly chaotic dynamics.
Since it is hardly possible to formally prove the absence
of any deterministic property, we intend to point out this
absence by comparing (nonlinear) statistics for original
data vs. their appropriate surrogate substitutes.

B. Records

Freeway traﬃc in North-Rhine Westphalia (Germany)
is continuously monitored at approximately 1400 road
locations by means of built-in loop detectors. For every
appearance of a vehicle these detectors record:

1. time,

2. velocity,

3. type of vehicle,

4. length of the vehicle.

This study is based on two diﬀerent types of static loop-
detector recordings:

1. Single car records:

Only a few exceptional time series have been
recorded with a notebook PC attached to the loop
detectors,

2. minute-aggregated data:

These data are obtained from the same loop detec-
tors as single- car data. However, instead of im-
mediate recording, the samplings are exponentially
smoothed and aggregated in 1-minute intervals.

Both single-car and minute aggregated records are
coarse-grained, since all records are denoted in [ ”0” . . .
”254” ], while ”255” denotes faulty results. Due to their
higher resolution, single-car data provide rare, but the
most detailled (and unspoilt) information, particularly
for short time scales.
For more details of sampling and processing read [6] and
[7]. Both articles provide a detailled introduction into
practial aspects of road traﬃc data.

1. Fundamental diagram

In the context of traﬃc analysis, the fundamental dia-
gram, well known to applied scientists, denotes the plot of
ﬂux vs. occupancy, in most cases graphed from smoothed
model output data (e.g. [11]) .
Fig. 2 was graphed from minute aggregated records. Due
to the discreteness of the latter, in a plot like Fig. 2,
some hundreds of thousands of data would fall into a few
bins. To improve the visualization, we added uniformly
0.5 < ξ < 0.5]
distributed independent random noise [
(the noise level scales below the resolution of the signal)
to the data. Fig. 2 gives an impression of traﬃc dynam-
ics, that undergoes transitions between two attractive re-
gions representing freeﬂow and jammed state. Whereas
the freeﬂow regime (high velocity, low occupancy) is sit-
uated transversally on the left hand side, the congested
state associates with a larger realm of points in the center
and on the right hand side.

1. Local stationarity assumption

Naturally, the double ﬁxed point structure, visualized
in ﬁgures 2 and 3, gives a strong indication against sta-
tionarity for the overall process of traﬃc dynamics that
comprises two traﬃc states.
In the following we will
therefore constrain the analysis to selected sections of
either freeﬂow or jammed traﬃc that are indicated by ar-
rows in Fig. 1. To apply methods that require regularly
sampled data we transform these sections of single-car
data equidistant by aggregation and linear interpolation,
expecting that this procedure does not have substantial
inﬂuence on the results.

C. Distribution of intervals between consecutive
events (time-headways)

Time-headway distributions from single car data have
already been reported in [7] for diﬀerent traﬃc states.
According to our results they reveal an approximately
lognormal distribution with diﬀerent parameters in de-
pendence of the traﬃc state (Fig.4 (a) and (b)). For
freeﬂow traﬃc the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistics

performs below the tabelled value

Dα=0.001 =

(2)

√n = 500

Thus, this test on distributional adaptation does not
state the rejection of the null-hypothesis of lognormal dis-
tribution. In Fig. 4(a) however, a deviation in the right
wing (reminding to a fat tail) is observed. The ﬁnite
left tail of the distributions probably reﬂects the neces-
sity to keep a security distance between vehicles. Data
of jammed traﬃc (Figure 4(b)) are comparably scarce.
Little, if anything, can be inferred from them.

D. Self Organized Criticality

Previous authors ([13]) already suspected that road
traﬃc has a selfsimilar nature in the context of the Self-
Organized Criticality (SOC) models. According to such
models, increasing traﬃc load would produce a ”critical”
situation, that, at its critical point, occasionally relaxes
catastrophically (e.g. as sandslides in the sandpile model
[14]). Close to the critical point, such a system generates
power law behaviour, observable in leptocurtic distribu-
tions, slowly converging variance, lack of characteristical
scales and 1/f noise.

Fig. 2 can be interpreted as ”phase plane” formed from
records. An alternative, more practicable method to ob-
tain a comparable clue on phase plane is delay coordi-
nate embedding, which denotes a n-dimensional plot xt
vs. xt+τ vs.
N of a time series
xt, t = 1, 2, . . . N .
The well-known general results by Takens [12] state that
the dynamics of a system recovered by delay coordinate
embedding are comparable to the dynamics of the origi-
nal system. A low dimensional deterministic-chaotic at-
tractor thus can be graphed from each of its observed
variables as a topologically equivalent structure to what
one would obtain from the graph of its variables in a
suﬃciently dimensioned delay plot. Since there is no
straightforward way to determine which dimension is suf-
ﬁciently large, several dimensions need to be examined.
According to [10] an optimal delay τ approximately cor-
responds to the empirical autocorrelation function (ACF)
at r(τ ) = 1/e. Fig. 3a) shows a delay plot of the veloc-
ity series xt used in Fig. 2, here plotted in time-delayed

In Fig. 3 (a) and (b) the data scatter
around two condensed regions, which can be identiﬁed
as congested and freeﬂow traﬃc.
We present Fig. 3 to visualize a clearer two ﬁxed-point
structure than in the ”traditional” plot Fig. 2. Moreover,
though the single car data base is not suﬃcient to obtain
a fundamental diagram, Fig. 3 (b) gives an indication of
comparable dynamics in single car data.

1. Distribution of velocities and velocity diﬀerences

Fig. 5 shows the histogram of traﬃc velocities of all
single-car data (12 diﬀerent locations).
In some loca-
tions slow congested traﬃc and jams appear as a smaller
second peak that, e.g.
for smaller data quantity, could
be misinterpreted as fat tail in the low-speed end of the
empirical velocity probability distribution function.
Comparable to the well-known heavy-tailed distributions
of logdiﬀerenced ﬁnancial time series, in ﬁg. 6 (a) we
observe a clearly non-normal distribution in diﬀerenced
velocity records, separated for either jam and free-ﬂow
records. This holds for logdiﬀerenced data as well (not
shown here). The histogram looks more leptocurtic for
free-ﬂow than for jammed traﬃc records.
The plot of the cumulated distribution function in
double-log coordinates provides a clue if the asymptotic
behaviour of the functional form of the cumulative dis-
tribution is ”visually” consistent with a power law,

where α is the exponent caracterizing the power law de-
cay,

([15]). Together with other indications, such a power law
can be regarded as a feature which is characteristic for
SOC processes ([16]).
Conversely, the cumulated distribution of diﬀerenced ve-
locities, separated for right and left wings of either jam
and freeﬂow records, displays no clear scaling region.
Non-normal distribution as well as lack of scaling is also
observable for the larger database of minute aggregated
records (not shown here).

E. Long-range dependence

(a)

(b)

Scientists in diverse ﬁelds observed empirically that
positive correlations between observations which are far
apart in time decay much slower than would be expected
from classical stochastic models. In time series such cor-
relations are characterized by the Hurst exponent H.
They are often referred to as Hurst eﬀect or long-range
dependence (LRD). 0.5 < H < 1 reﬂects long-range posi-
tive correlations between sequential data. H = 0.5 corre-
sponds to sequential uncorrelatedness (known for white
noise). Brownian motion, the trail of white noise, is char-
acterized by H = 1.
Since long-range dependence (LRD) is deﬁned by the au-
tocorrelation function (ACF), theoretically, the shape of
the ACF provides an indication for LRD in road traf-
ﬁc. For LRD series, the ACF at large lags should have a
hyperbolical shape:

([17]).
The practical ability to assure an algebraic decay of the
ACF however is low, making such an approach inviable
for data analysis. For comparable reasons, from the tail
of the distribution, additional information is hardly ob-
tainable; statistics here are generally poor ([18]). The
discreteness of car traﬃc data additionally diminishes the
quality of such estimations.

1. Hurst-exponent estimation

The estimation of the Hurst-exponent (H) from em-
pirical data is not a simple task. Several studies (e.g.
[17],[19],[20]) estimate the Hurst exponent H from diﬀer-
ent measures.
Synthetically generated fractional Brownian motion or
fractional ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving av-
erage) series are characterized by a generalized (or global)
H. Such so called monofractional series are known to re-
veal ﬂuctuations on all time scales.
They will produce unambiguous evidence for fractional-
ity, whereas a more general class of heterogeneous signals
exist that are made up of many interwoven sets with dif-
ferent local Hurst exponents, called multifractional ([21]).
It is a frequent experience, that graphical methods to
test for LRD show no clear scaling for such series. Our
own experience is, that weighted sums of synthetically
generated random walks with diﬀerent characteristical
scales may as well reveal straight fractional scaling in
some plots, as crossover behaviour according to other
methods. Furthermore, some methods of H-estimation
sensitively depend on the distribution of the data.
The main criticism against H-estimates is based on the
experience that instationary data may, at least in some
cases, produce estimates that erroneously indicate frac-
tionality. Thus, we are interested in the robustness of
H-estimators, if possible eﬀects of instationarity are ex-
cluded. Phase-randomized surrogates (PRS) based on
original traﬃc records are random sequences with the
same ﬁrst and second order properties (the mean, the
variance and the auto-covariance data, but which are oth-
erwise random.
Since fractionality is a spectral property, and PRS fully
recover the latter, H-estimation of PRS hence provides
an approach to exclude possibly misleading eﬀecs of in-
stationarity, albeit not to diﬀerentiate between monofrac-
tional and heterogeneous signals.

To obtain reliable H-estimates despite possible eﬀects
of nonstationarity, we apply a variety of the most famil-
iar methods to jam- and freeﬂow traﬃc records. For a
detailled discussion about the application of methods to
conclude on LRD, e.g. aggregated variance method, R/S
plot, periodogram method and wavelet-based Whittle-
estimator on nonstationary data read [19]. Detrended

We also applied the wavelet-based Whittle estimator
([23]). Despite its postulated robustness against insta-
tionarity, and despite H-estimates that compare to ta-
ble I, we do not show the graphs here, since, particularly
for the jam series, the wavelet-spectrum oﬀers to many
possibilities of parametrization, as. e.g. the choice of the
wavelet function, octaves etc..

method outlined in [17], the logaritmically spaced spec-
trum was divided into 60 boxes of equal length. The least
squares ft was performed to averages of the data inside
these boxes, to compensate for the fact that most of the
frequencies in the spectrum fall on the far right, whereas
for LRD-investigation the low frequencies are of inter-
est. Fig. 8(a) gives the strongest indication that traﬃc
dynamics can not be characterized as monofractional as
most of the common Hurst-estimators would indicate.

F. Time reversibility test

An important property to diﬀerentiate between linear
and nonlinear stochastic processes is time-reversibility,
i.e. the statistical properties are the same forward and
backward in time. From this test one can not judge
whether the data correspond to any ARMA-model, since
theoretically, time asymmetry might be caused by non-
Gaussian innovations. Apart from on-ramps, traﬃc dy-
namics on short time scales anyway is unlikely to be sub-
stantially inﬂuenced by external noise.
The following expression is outlined as a measure to con-

Q(τ ) =

wherein τ denotes the delay time and E represents the
time average. The basic idea behind it is to compare the
time reversibility test statistics of the original data Q(τ )
with conﬁdence bounds from corresponding test statistics
Qsur(τ ), generated from surrogate series:

Qsurr(c′

The test is based on the assumption that the surrogate
test statistics for a given lag are approximately Gaussian
distributed.
The statistical properties of the examined surrogate time
series are the same forward and backward in time. Thus
they comply with the null-hypothesis of time-reversibility
which will be tried to reject by the test.
The evaluation of signiﬁcances for more than one lag
leads to the statistical problem of multiple testing. This
has severe implications on the probability to reject the
null-hypothesis. The Bonferroni-correction of the signif-
icance level must be taken into account:

wherein n denotes the number of independent tests.
Practically, Bonferroni- corrected conﬁdence bands ren-
der little diagnostic power to detect a violation of the
null-hypothesis. A corrected signiﬁcance level, for ex-
ˆα = 0.95 for 100 independent tests requires
ample, 1

In most cases, however, Q(τ ) is au-
α
tocorrelated to an unknown extent, what diminishes the
number of independent tests and, for rejection of the null-
hypothesis, results in a conservative test design.
In Fig. 9, surrogate-based time-reversibility tests for jam
and freeﬂow traﬃc states are graphed. Under the as-
sumption of 100 independent tests for α = 0.001, the
corrected signiﬁcance level is: ˆα = 1
≈
0.905, which, though not acceptable as safe statistical
inference, gives a vague information that freeﬂow traf-
ﬁc dynamics is more likely time-irreversible than time-
reversible. For the jammed state the observed 20 devi-
ations of the conﬁdence bands gives a comfortably safe
rejection of the null-hyothesis, particularly for short time
scales, but also for larger τ . Since, even for the naked eye,

the test statistics is substantially correlated, the test pro-
vides a safe rejection. For the freeﬂow state, 14 deviations
from H0 are also statistically indicative, albeit less corre-
lation among the test statistics is observable. Both traﬃc
states thus are likely to reveal time-irreversible statistical
properties.

G. Recurrence plot

For a time series xt the recurrence plot is a two-
dimensional graph that is formed from embedded vectors

~y(t) = (xt, xt+τ , . . . , xt+(E−1)τ )

(12)

for embedding dimension E and lag τ . These vectors are
compared if they are in ǫ-proximity of another ~y(t + ∆t).

tainable.
Since the diﬀerences

is called the correlation integral. The resulting Cr(ǫ) is
sketched in a double logarithmical Grassberger-Procaccia
plot ([24]) in dependence of ǫ.
The correlation integral is plotted for varying dimension
as well as varying ǫ. If a noise-contaminated determin-
istic process is regarded, from a suﬃcient embedding di-
mension, parallel slopes for varying dimensions indicate
power law scaling in a region which is situated above a
certain ǫ that represents the noise range.

Figure 11 shows Grassberger-Procaccia plots for (a)
free ﬂow traﬃc and (b) jammed state records for error
distances ǫ of values 0.1 . . . 100 and embedding dimension
2 . . . 25. Both graphs fail to reveal any scaling region,
moreover there is obviously no diﬀerence to Grassberger-
Procaccia plots of appropriate surrogate realizations.
The dimensions of merely stochastic systems appear in-
ﬁnite, therefore for this case it is a typical result, that
the correlation integral reveals the embedding dimension
([25]).

Local linear models are suggested a test for nonlinearity
([26]). The average forecast error is computed as func-
tion of the neighbourhood size on which the ﬁt is per-
formed. If the optimum occurs at large neighbourhood
sizes, the data are (in this embedding) best described by
a linear stochastic process, whereas an optimum at rather
small neighbourhood sizes supports the idea of existence
of a nonlinear, almost deterministic, equation of motion
([25]).

In Fig. 12 the Casdagli-test was performed for origi-
nal as well as for surrogate data. In the context of the
Casdagli-test it is meaningless some of jam records fall
not within the surrogate-based conﬁdence intervals. The
qualitative comparability gives an indication for predom-
inant stochasticity particularly in freeﬂow traﬃc records.

IV. DISCUSSION

According to our analysis of traﬃc records, traﬃc dy-
namics is a two ﬁxed point stochastic process, while the
ﬁxed points reﬂect the jam and freeﬂow regime.
The abrupt transitions between the traﬃc states imply
nonlinearity in the overall traﬃc dynamics. A variety
of methods, more or less sensitive towards nonstationar-
ity, yields Hurst-exponents that indicate long-range de-
pendent dynamics in particular for freeﬂow traﬃc. Dif-
ferenced as well as logdiﬀerenced velocity records reveal
heavy tailed distribution, however for both there is no

clear scaling region observabele to estimate scaling expo-
nents.
From our results it must be concluded that below diur-
nal time scales traﬃc data in jammed as in freeﬂow state
exhibit neither deterministic nor low dimensional chaotic
properties.
The main intention of this article is to outline an overview
of the stochastical properties achieved by data analysis
of single-car road traﬃc records.
Attending the problem of criticality in road traﬃc
records, we ﬁnd that as well the two ﬁxed-point dynam-
ics as the distribution of (diﬀerenced) velocities are con-
trary to the typical features of processes governed by self-
organized criticality. This lets us rather suspect the rise
of jams in the context of a (eventually, but not neces-
sarily, critical) phenomenon linked to a phase-transition.
For such a model hypothesis, known e.g. in equilibrium
thermodynamics, the point of transition can be reached
by ﬁne tuning of a parameter. This must be distinguished
from self-organized criticality, which represents the clas-
siﬁcation for systems attracted permanently by variable
critical states.
Contrary to the well-known conceptual analogy between
traﬃc and granular ﬂow, we rather propose an intu-
itive analogy of traﬃc dynamics with the condensation of
steam to water. In contrast to the condensation of water
driven by withdrawal of heat, free ﬂow traﬃc condenses
to higher particle density by an increase of traﬃcants in
this picture. This increase can be interpreted as rised
pressure. In accordance to such considerations and the
empirical results of [4] increasing traﬃc load (or input to
the motorway) produces a (in the more popular sense)
”critical” tension that relaxes in an abrupt transition to
a jam. In this instructive example, traﬃc accidents, con-
struction sites or slow vehicles could act comparable to
condensation cores by exerting strong nonlinear negative
feedback on the upstream traﬃc. The ﬁne tuning pa-

rameter thus is the capacitiy of the motorway, limited by
traﬃc load, accidents or construction sites.

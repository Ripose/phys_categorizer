Escape of a Uniform Random Walk from an Interval

∗

We study the ﬁrst-passage properties of a random walk in the unit interval in which the length
of a single step is uniformly distributed over the ﬁnite range [−a, a]. For a of the order of one, the
exit probabilities to each edge of the interval and the exit time from the interval exhibit anomalous
properties stemming from the change in the minimum number of steps to escape the interval as a
function of the starting point. As a decreases, ﬁrst-passage properties approach those of continuum
diﬀusion, but non-diﬀusive eﬀects remain because of residual discreteness eﬀects.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Consider a discrete-time random walk in which the
length of each step is uniformly distributed in the range
a, a]. We term this process the uniform random walk
[
−
(URW). The walker is initially at an arbitrary point x in
the unit interval [0,1] and the endpoints are absorbing.
For the URW, an absorbing boundary is deﬁned such that
if the walk crosses an endpoint of the interval, the walk
is trapped exactly at this endpoint. We are interested in
the ﬁrst-passage properties of this URW.

One motivation for this study comes from the prob-
lem of DNA sequence recognition by a mobile protein
[1, 2]. The protein molecule typically seeks its target by
a combination of diﬀusion along the DNA chain, and also
detachment and subsequent reattachment of the protein
at a point many base pairs away, and the basic quantity
of interest is the time required for the protein to ﬁnd its
target on a ﬁnite DNA chain [1, 2, 3]. The two mecha-
nisms of diﬀusion and detachment/reattachment can be
viewed as a random walk along the chain with a variable
step length distribution [3]. This is the viewpoint that
we shall adopt for this work. A second motivation for our
work is that when individual step lengths are drawn from
a continuous distribution, the resulting random walk ex-
hibit a variety of interesting properties beyond those of
the discrete random walk. These include, among oth-
ers, both unusual ﬁrst-passage properties [4, 5] as well as
extreme-value phenomena [6].

Here we study the related problem of ﬁrst-passage
properties of the URW in a ﬁnite interval. Perhaps the
most basic such feature is the exit probability R(x), de-
ﬁned as the probability for a walk that starts at x to
eventually cross the boundary at x = 1. Since the prob-
R(x), we need
ability to exit via the left boundary is 1
only consider exit to the right boundary, for which we re-
serve the term exit probability. A related quantity is the
mean exit time t(x), deﬁned as the average time to exit
the interval at either boundary when the walk starts from

x. This exit time from an interval has been investigated
for a random walk with general single-step hopping prob-
abilities [7, 8, 9, 10] and also in an econophysics context
[4]. As we shall see, the interplay between the maximum
step size and the interval length leads to commensuration
eﬀects that are absent when the step length distribution
extends over an inﬁnite range.

For both pure diﬀusion and the classical random walk
with the step length ∆x = 1/N , where N is an arbi-
trary integer, it is well known that the exit probability
from an absorbing interval is R(x) = x [11, 12]. Simi-
larly, the mean exit time is t(x) = x(1
x)/2D, where
the diﬀusion coeﬃcient for the discrete random walk is
(∆x)2
the mean-square length
D =
h
of a single step. We now determine these ﬁrst-passage
properties—the exit probability and the exit time—for
the URW.

II. GENERAL FEATURES

−

To help visualize the general behavior, we performed
numerical simulations of the URW by a probability prop-
agation algorithm; for the URW, this approach is orders
of magnitude more eﬃcient than direct Monte Carlo sim-
ulation. In probability propagation, we ﬁrst divide the
unit interval into N discrete points. We correspondingly
discretize the URW as follows: a URW that moves uni-
formly within the range [
a, a] at each step is equivalent
to its discretized counterpart hopping equiprobably to
any one of the aN discrete points on either side of the
current site. When an element of probability hops out-
side the interval, this element is considered to be trapped
at the boundary where the element left the interval. We
6 of the ini-
continue this propagation until less than 10−
tial probability remains in the interval. Running the
propagation further led to insigniﬁcant corrections. The
simulations were generally performed with N = 5000.
We found negligible diﬀerences in our results when the in-
terval was discretized into N = 10000 points. This prob-
ability propagation algorithm is also considerably more
eﬃcient than naive Monte Carlo simulation of an ensem-
ble of random walkers.

is discussed in Sec. IV.

→ ∞

When a is of the order of 1, non-diﬀusive features
arise because the walk can traverse the interval in just
, R(x) = 1/2 for all x;
a few steps. In the limit a
that is, either boundary is reached equiprobably, inde-
pendent of the initial position. Conversely, for a
1,
the ﬁrst-passage properties of the URW approach those
x, except when the
of continuum diﬀusion. Thus R(x)
starting point is close to a boundary (Fig. 1).
In this
boundary region, R(x) undergoes a series of transitions
in which the nth derivative is discontinuous whenever x
or 1
x passes through na. These transitions become
more apparent upon plotting R′(x) versus x (Fig. 2). For
small a, the qualitative behavior of R′ is reminiscent of
the Gibbs’ overshoot phenomenon [13] when expanding
a square wave in a Fourier series.

where a is the width of the single-step distribution. The data
for a = 0.1 are based on probability propagation, while the
other two datasets are obtained analytically.

It is worth noting that the URW in an absorbing in-
terval is not a martingale [14] and hence R(x)
= x in
general. That is, the URW is not a “fair” process. The
unfairness arises because when a walk crosses the bound-
ary and ostensibly lands outside the interval, the walk is
reassigned to be trapped at the edge of the interval. Thus
the mean position of the probability distribution is not
conserved. Another consequence of the unfairness is that
the exit probability R(x = 0) for ﬁxed a, no matter how
small, is non-zero. The possibility of starting at x = 0
and exiting at x = 1 can be viewed as an eﬀective bias of
the walk toward the middle of the interval. In the con-
text of the gambler’s ruin problem [11], a gambler that is
about to be ruined appears to be best served by making
a reckless bet that is of the order of the total amount of
capital in the game.

The mean exit time of the URW deviates strongly from
the continuum diﬀusive form t(x) = x(1
x)/2D, when
a becomes of the order of 1 (Fig. 3). Notice also that t(x)

a < 0.5 is based on simulation, while the remaining data is
obtained analytically.

havior again reﬂects the fact that there is a non-negligible
probability for a walk that starts at one edge of the inter-
val to exit via the opposite edge, a process that requires
a non-zero time.

III. FIRST-PASSAGE PROPERTIES

In general, the exit probability may be determined
from the backward equation that expresses the exit prob-
ability R(x) in terms of the exit probability after one
step of the random walk has elapsed [12]. This backward

equation has the generic form

R(x) =

dx′ p(x

x′)R(x′) .

(1)

Z

→

That is, the exit probability starting from x equals the
probability of making a single step to x′ times the prob-
ability of exit from x′, integrated over all possible values
of x′. In a parallel fashion, the mean exit time can gener-
ically be written as

t(x) =

dx′ p(x

x′)[t(x′) + 1] .

That is, the exit time starting from x equals one plus the
exit time from x′, when integrated over all possible values
x′). Note that
of x′, with each term weighted by p(x
the trailing factor of 1 can be taken outside the integral
sum since
x′) = 1. We now apply these
two formulae to determine ﬁrst-passage properties for the

URW by studying, in turn, the cases a > 1, a

When a > 1, the support of the probability distribu-
tion necessarily extends beyond the unit interval after
one step. The residue that remains in the interval is also
uniformly distributed. These facts allow us to obtain
R(x) and t(x) by simple probabilistic reasoning. After
one step, the walk jumps past x = 1 with probability

We now compute the mean exit time. Again, there
are two cases to consider: either the walk begins within
a) or it begins in the complementary outer subin-
(a, 1
tervals. Let us denote by tin(x) and tout(x) as the mean
exit times when the walk starts at a point x in the in-
ner and in the outer subintervals, respectively. Then the

To complete the solution, we need To determine the
three unknown constants T, τ1, and τ2. The solution is
straightforward and the details are given in Appendix A.
From this solution, quoted in Eq. (A6), we obtain the
mean exit times plotted in Fig. 3. As a decreases, t(x)
quickly approaches the parabolic form of the diﬀusive
limit, but t(0) and t(1) = t(0) remain strictly greater
than zero when a is non zero.

It is straightforward to treat smaller values of a, but
the bookkeeping of the various subintervals becomes in-

fer general properties of the exit probability. From
Eqs. (14a) & (14b), we have 2aR′(x = a+) = R(2a)

R(0) while 2aR′(x = a−) = R(2a). Thus R′(x) has a
jump of magnitude R(0)/2a when x passes through a, as
0.4. Similarly, consider R′′(x)

near x = 2a. By (14b), R′′(x) is coupled to R′(x + a)
and R′(x

its argument equals a. Thus R′′(x) has a jump of magni-
tude R(0)/4a2 when x passes through 2a. This pattern

continues so that for a
R(x) has a jump discontinuity as x passes through na,
while all lower derivatives are continuous. Thus R(x) be-
comes progressively smoother and more linear in visual
appearance for x deeper in the interior of the interval.

and the two associated classes of subintervals. The shaded
subintervals are labeled sequentially as deﬁned in the text.

The analytical solution for R(x) can, in principle, be
obtained from the backward equations (14a)–(14c), for
the exit probability. When a < 1/2, these equations
naturally partition the unit interval into two classes of
subintervals as shown in Fig. 7. Nearest-neighbor shaded
subintervals are coupled only to each other by these back-
ward equations, and similarly for the complementary
subintervals. It is convenient to deﬁne rk(x) as the exit
1)a in the
probability for a walk that begins at x + (k
−
kth shaded subinterval; that is rk(x) = R(x+(k
1)a) for
x
1)a, ka). With these conventions, the backward
equations for the exit probability for a starting point in
one of the shaded or in one of the unshaded subintervals
have the matrix form:

To solve these equations, we note that the eigenvalues
of the above matrix are given by λj = 2i cos(πj/(n + 1)),
with j = 1, 2, . . . , n [15]. Thus rn(x) is, in general, a
linear superposition of the eigenvectors of the matrix;
these are sinusoidal functions with arguments λj/2a. The
actual form of R(x) is then obtained by ﬁxing the various
constants in this eigenvector expansion through matching
the components rk at appropriate boundary points.

IV. EXIT PROBABILITY FOR a → 0

In the limit a

0, the diﬀusion approximation be-
comes increasingly accurate so that R(x) is very nearly
equal to x, except in a small region of the order of a near

→

each boundary (Fig. 1). This deviation is more clearly
evident when plotting R′(x) versus x (Fig. 2). As a gets
small, this plot also suggests that a good approximation
to R′(x) will be obtained by solving the exact equation
for R′(x) in the boundary region and treating R′(x) as a
constant in the interior of the interval.

At a zero-order level of approximation, we assume that

R′(x) is position dependent for x
−
a, 1) and is constant otherwise. Then within (0, a), the
backward equation 2aR′(x) = R(x+ a) means that R′(x)
is a linear function (and similarly for x
a, 1)). Thus
we make the ansatz

constants in the ﬁrst line also ensure the obvious special
case R(1/2) = 1/2. Similarly, the linear form for R′(x)
in the boundary regions roughly corresponds to what is
seen in Fig. 2.

Shown dotted is the result of our zeroth-order asymptotic
approximation R(0) = a/[2(1 + a)], while the dashed curve is
the result of the ﬁrst-order approximation.

We determine the 4 unknowns in the above asymptotic
approximation for R(x) by the following conditions: (i)
2aR′(x) = R(x + a) must be satisﬁed in the region x
∈
(0, a) (this gives two conditions—one for the linear term
and one for the constant term), (ii) R(x) is continuous,
(iii) the discontinuity in R′(x) at x = a equals R(0)/2a,
as follows from Eqs. (14a) and (14b). Applying these
conditions gives, after some simple calculation,

s =

A much better approximation is obtained by treating
R(x) exactly in the domains (0, a) and (a, 2a), and then

6

assuming that R′(x) is constant otherwise. Thus for x >
2a, R(x) is given by the ﬁrst line of Eq. (26), while within
(0, a) and (a, 2a), the governing backward equations for
R(x) are

2aR′(x) =

R(x + a)

For x < a, we iterate the ﬁrst equation to give
4a2R′′(x) = R(x + 2a)
R(x) and make use of the as-
sumption that R′(x) = s for x > 2a. This leads to the

Similarly, to obtain R(x) in the region (a, 2a), we in-
tegrate the backward equation 2aR′(x) = R(x + a)
−
R(x

in R(x + a) is beyond 2a, so that R(x + a) is a linear

We determine the 4 coeﬃcients in these two forms for
R(x) by requiring that at x = a, R is continuous and
the ﬁrst derivative has a jump of magnitude R(0)/2a,
while at x = 2a, both R and R′ are continuous. The
resulting formulae are given in Appendix B. Fig. 2 shows
the result of this small-a approximation for R′(x). The
agreement between this asymptotic approximation and
the numerical results is extremely good.

As a further test of the accuracy of this approach, we
show the numerically-obtained dependence of R(0) on a
together with our zeroth- and ﬁrst-order approximations
for R(0) (Fig. 8). As already mentioned in Sec. II, R(0)
is greater than zero for any a > 0 because there is a non-
zero chance that a walk exactly at the left boundary can
still exit via the right boundary. In the limit of small a,
our asymptotic approach for R(0) closely approximates
the data.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

An enigmatic feature of the uniform random walk
(URW) is that its ﬁrst-passage properties in a ﬁnite in-
terval are not described in terms of a radiation boundary
condition [12, 16]. This boundary condition is c′ = c/κ,
where κ is the extrapolation length. This condition can
be interpreted as partial absorption and partial reﬂec-
tion when a walk hits the boundary.
In the case of a
URW that starts at one absorbing boundary, there is
a non-zero chance for the walk to exit via the opposite
boundary. This incomplete absorption should be equiva-
lent to partial reﬂection from the initial boundary, which
should be described by a radiation boundary condition.

Indeed, the probability distribution of a URW in a semi-
inﬁnite interval x > 0 with absorption at x = 0 closely
approximates that obtained for pure diﬀusion with a ra-
diation boundary condition. However, in the ﬁnite inter-
val the radiation boundary condition gives R(x) as the
linear function R(x) = x+κ
1+2κ which does not account for
the anomalous behavior observed near the edges of the
interval.

n+1 , 1
( 1

What we do ﬁnd is that the ﬁrst-passage properties
of the URW in a ﬁnite interval exhibit curious com-
mensuration eﬀects as a passes through 1, 1
3 . . .. For
n ), the nth derivative of R(x) has a jump dis-
a
continuity as x passes through na, while all lower deriva-
tives are continuous. The exit time has corresponding
singular behaviors. For small n, we have computed the
exit probability and the mean exit time exactly by a
direct probabilistic approach.
0, the
diﬀusion approximation becomes increasingly accurate,
except when the starting point is close to either bound-
ary where the exit probability continues to exhibit non-
diﬀusive eﬀects. In the limit of small a, we constructed
an approximation of treating the exit probability exactly
within the boundary region, an approach that gives ex-
tremely accurate results.

continuity of size R(0). Similarly, at x = 2a, both R(x)
and R′(x) are continuous. From Eqs. (28) and (29), we

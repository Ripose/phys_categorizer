A more exact solution for incorporating multiplicative systematic uncertainties
in branching ratio limits

A method for incorporating systematic errors into branching ratio limits which are not obtained
from a simple counting analysis has been suggested by Mark Convery [1]. The derivation makes
some approximations which are not necessarily valid. This note presents the full solution as an
alternative. The basic idea is a simple extension of the Cousins and Highland philosophy [2].
Before systematics are considered, an analysis using a maximum likelihood ﬁt returns a central
value for the branching ratio ( ˆB) and a statistical error (σB). The likelihood function is

p(B)

Following the Convery notation, we associate ˆS with the nominal eﬃciency and σS as the (Gaus-
sian) error on the eﬃciency. Adding the uncertainty on the eﬃciency changes the likelihood to:

It turns out that as long as the eﬃciency ˆS is suﬃciently small (generally less than 10% but
dependent on other parameters), the second erf term evaluates to
1 and the dependence on the
eﬃciency is removed.

The diﬀerences between Eq. 3 and Eq. 4 are the two erf terms in Eq. 3. The ﬁrst erf term
aﬀects the tails of the distribution and becomes increasingly important as σǫ increases. The second

σS is not easily contained in the

First we check the eﬀect for relatively large σǫ and small ˆS for which the ﬁrst erf term becomes
important. Each plot of Figure 1 shows a comparison between the full solution in red and the
approximate solution in black. There is very little discernible diﬀerence between the two solutions.
The diﬀerent plots show results for ˆB = 0.5, ˆB =
1.5. To set an upper limit, one
often integrates the probability over the physical region only (B > 0). Figure 2 shows the results
for the case of ˆB =
for p(B) over the range B
1.5 and σB = 0.5 which corresponds
to a 3σ negative ﬂuctuation. In this case clear diﬀerences between the full solution (in red) and
0.3. Note that Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 2(b)
the approximate solution (black) can be seen for σǫ
show the same curves, only the range has changed. Clearly an attempt to ﬁnd an upper limit
by integrating the area under the approximate solution is problematic for all the cases shown in
Fig. 2. Conversely, the full solution ﬁnds an acceptable upper limit.

Figure 1: Each plot shows a comparison of the approximate solution given by Eq. 4 in black to
the full solution given by Eq. 3 in red. For all plots, σB = 0.5, σǫ = 0.4, and ˆS = ǫ = 0.1. The
three plots show results for ˆB = 0.5, ˆB =

Second we check the eﬀect of the second erf term of Eq. 3 which is important when the
integration of eﬃciency from 0 to 1 in Eq. 2 cuts oﬀ a signiﬁcant part of the Gaussian deﬁned by
ˆS
σǫ ˆS. Figure 3(a) is a repeat of Fig. 1(a) on a diﬀerent scale and again shows little
±
diﬀerence between the two methods. Figures 3(b) and 3(c) show the eﬀect of the second erf term

In conclusion, Eq. 3 provides a more exact and robust implementation of the original suggestion
by Convery [1] on incorporating multiplicative systematic uncertainties in branching ratio limits.

The dynamics of a wide range of real systems, from email patterns to earthquakes, display a
bursty, intermittent nature, characterized by short timeframes of intensive activity followed by long
times of no or reduced activity. The understanding of the origin of such bursty patterns is hindered
by the lack of tools to compare diﬀerent systems using a common framework. We introduce two
measures to distinguish the mechanisms responsible for the bursty nature of real signals, changes in
the interevent times and memory. We ﬁnd that while the burstiness of natural phenomena is rooted
in both the interevent time distribution and memory, for human dynamics memory is weak, and the
bursty character is due to changes in the interevent time distribution. Finally, we show that current
models lack in their ability to reproduce the activity pattern observed in real systems, opening up
new avenues for future work.

The dynamics of most complex systems is driven by
the loosely coordinated activity of a large number of com-
ponents, such as individuals in the society or molecules
in the cell. While we witnessed much progress in the
study of the networks behind these systems [1], advances
towards understanding the system’s dynamics has been
slower. With increasing potential to monitor the time-
resolved activity of most components of selected complex
systems, such as time-resolved email [2, 3, 4], web brows-
ing [5], and gene expression [6] patterns, we have the op-
portunity to ask an important question: is the dynamics
of complex systems governed by generic organizing prin-
ciples, or each system has its own distinct dynamical fea-
tures? While it is diﬃcult to oﬀer a deﬁnite answer to
this question, a common feature across many systems is
increasingly documented: the burstiness of the system’s
activity patterns.

Bursts, vaguely corresponding to signiﬁcantly en-
hanced activity levels over short periods of time followed
by long periods of inactivity, have been observed in a
wide range of systems, from email patterns [3] to earth-
quakes [7, 8] and gene expression [6]. Yet, often bursti-
ness is more of a metaphor than a quantitative feature,
and opinions about its origin diverge. In human dynam-
ics, burstiness has been reduced to the fat-tailed nature
of the response time distribution [3, 4], in contrast with
earthquakes and weather patterns, where memory eﬀects
appear to play a key role [9, 10]. Once present, burstiness
can aﬀect the spreading of viruses [3] or resource alloca-
tion [11]. Also, deviations towards regular, “anti-bursty”
behavior in heartbeat may indicate disease progression
[12]. Given the diversity of systems in which it emerges,
there is a need to place burstiness on a strong quanti-
tative basis. Our goal in this paper is to make a ﬁrst
step in this direction, by developing measures that can
help quantify the magnitude and potential origin of the
bursty patterns seen in diﬀerent real systems.

Let us consider a system whose components have a
measurable activity pattern that can be mapped into
a discrete signal, recording the moments when some
events take place, like an email being sent, or a pro-
tein being translated. The activity pattern is random
(Poisson process) if the probability of an event is time-
independent.
In this case the interevent time between
two consecutive events (τ ) follows an exponential distri-
bution, PP(τ ) ∼ exp(−τ /τ0) (Fig. 1a). An apparently
bursty (or anti-bursty) signal could emerge if P (τ ) is dif-
ferent from the exponential, such as the bursty pattern
of Fig. 1b, or the more regular pattern of Fig. 1c. Yet,
changes in the interevent time distribution is not the only
way to generate a bursty signal. For example, the sig-
nals shown in Fig. 1d,e have exactly the same P (τ ) as in
Fig. 1a, yet they have a more bursty or a more regular
in
character. This is achieved by introducing memory:
Fig. 1d the short interevent times tend to follow short
ones, resulting in a bursty look. In Fig. 1e the relative
regularity is due to a memory eﬀect acting in the oppo-
site direction: short (long) interevent times tend to be
followed by long (short) ones. Therefore, the apparent
burstiness of a signal can be rooted in two, mechanisti-
cally quite diﬀerent deviations from a Poisson process:
changes in the interevent time distribution or memory.
To distinguish these eﬀects, we introduce the burstiness
parameter ∆ and the memory parameter µ, that quantify
the relative contribution of each in real systems.

The burstiness parameter ∆ is deﬁned as

∆ ≡

sgn(στ − mτ )
2

Z
0

∞

|P (τ ) − PP(τ )|dτ ,

(1)

where mτ and στ are the mean and the standard devi-
ation of P (τ ) [13]. The meaning of ∆ is illustrated in
Fig. 1f–h, where we compare P (τ ) for a bursty- (Fig. 1f)
and an anti-bursty (Fig. 1g) signal with a Poisson in-
terevent time distribution. A signal will appear bursty

bursty signal (c) generated by the Gaussian interevent time

emerge through memory as well. For example, the bursty sig-
nal shown in (d) is obtained by shuﬄing the Poisson signal
of (a) to increase the memory eﬀect. A more regular look-
ing signal, with negative memory, is obtained by the same
shuﬄing procedure (e). Note that signals in (a), (d) and (e)
have identical interevent time distribution. (f) An interevent

erence distribution (dotted). (h) The stretched exponential

quency of the interevent times is enhanced near the av-
erage and depleted in the short and long interevent time
region (Fig. 1g). ∆ is bounded in the range (−1, 1),
and its magnitude correlates with the signal’s burstiness:
∆ = 1 is the most bursty signal, ∆ = 0 is completely
neutral (Poisson), and ∆ = −1 corresponds to a com-
pletely regular (periodic) signal. For example, in Fig. 1h
we show ∆ for the stretched exponential distribution,
PSE(τ ) = u(τ /τ0)u−1 exp[−(τ /τ0)u]/τ0 , often used to
approximate the interevent time distributions of complex
systems [14]. The smaller the u is, the burstier is the sig-
nal, and for u → 0, PSE(τ ) follows a power law with the
exponent −1, for which ∆ = 1. For u = 1, PSE(τ ) is
simply the exponential distribution with ∆ = 0. Finally,
for u > 1, the larger u is, the more regular is the signal,
and for u → ∞, P (τ ) converges to a Dirac delta function
with ∆ = −1.

Most complex systems display a remarkable hetero-
geneity: some components may be very active, and others
much less so. For example, some users may send dozens
of emails during a day, while others only one or two. To
combine the activity levels of so diﬀerent components,
we can group the signals based on their average activity
level, and measure P (τ ) only for components with similar
activity level. As the insets in Fig. 2 show, the obtained
curves are systematically shifted.
If we plot, however,
τ0P (τ ) as a function of τ /τ0, where τ0 being the average
interevent time, the data collapse into a single curve F (x)
(Fig. 2), indicating that the interevent time distribution
follows P (τ ) = (1/τ0)F (τ /τ0), where F (x) is indepen-
dent of the average activity level of the component, and
represents an universal characteristic of the particular
system [8, 15]. This raises an important question: will ∆
depend on τ0? The burstiness parameter ∆ is invariant
under the time rescaling as ˜τ ≡ τ /τ0 and ˜P (˜τ ) ≡ τ0P (τ )
with a constant τ0, since ˜∆ ≡
| ˜P (˜τ ) − ˜P0(˜τ )|d˜τ =
|P (τ ) − P0(τ )|dτ ≡
|τ0P (τ ) − τ0P0(τ )|d(τ /τ0) =
0
∆, i.e., it characterizes the universal function F (x). Such
R
invariance of ∆ enables us to assign to each system a sin-
gle burstiness parameter, despite the diﬀerent activity
level of its components.

is higher than in a random signal (Fig. 1f), resulting
in many short intervals separated by longer periods of

Mapping complex systems on the (µ, ∆) space— Given
that the burstiness of a signal can have two qualitatively
diﬀerent origins, the best way to characterize a real sys-
tem is to identify its µ and ∆ parameters, placing them
in a (µ, ∆) phase diagram (Fig. 3). As a ﬁrst example,
we measured the spacing between the consecutive occur-
rence of the same letter in texts of diﬀerent kind, era, and
language [16]. For these signals, we ﬁnd ∆ ≈ 0, i.e., the
interevent time distribution follows closely an exponen-
tial (Fig. 2b) and µ ≈ 0.01, indicating the lack of memory.
Thus this signal is best described by a Poisson process, at
the origin of the phase diagram (Fig. 3). In contrast, nat-
ural phenomena, like earthquakes [17] and weather pat-
terns [18] are in the vicinity of the diagonal, indicating
that P (τ ) and memory equally contribute to their bursty
character. The situation is quite diﬀerent, however, for
human activity, ranging from email and phone commu-
nication to web browsing and library visitation patterns
[2, 4, 5, 20]. For these we ﬁnd a high ∆ and small or
negligible µ, indicating that while these systems display
signiﬁcant burstiness rooted in P (τ ), memory plays a
small role in their temporal inhomogeneity. This lack of
memory is quite unexpected, as it suggests the lack of
predictability in these systems in contrast with natural
phenomena, where strong memory eﬀects could lead to
predictive tools. Finally for cardiac rhythms describing
the time between two consecutive heartbeats (Fig. 2c)
[21], we ﬁnd ∆cardiac, healthy = −0.73(4) for healthy in-
dividuals and ∆cardiac, CHF = −0.82(6) for patients with
congestive heart failure (CHF), both signals being highly

regular. Thus the ∆ parameter captures the fact that
cardiac rhythm is more regular with CHF than in the
healthy condition [12]. Furthermore, we ﬁnd µ ≈ 0.97,
indicating that memory also plays a very important role
in the signal’s regularity.

The discriminative nature of the (µ, ∆) phase diagram
is illustrated by the non-random placement of the diﬀer-
ent systems in the plane: human activity patterns cluster
together in the high ∆, low µ region, natural phenomena
near the diagonal, heartbeats in the high µ, negative ∆
region and texts near ∆ = µ = 0, underlying the exis-
tence of distinct classes of dynamical mechanisms driving
the temporal activity in these systems.

Following the clustering of the empirical measurements
in the phase diagram, a natural question emerges: to
what degree can current models reproduce the observed
quantitative features of bursty processes? Queueing
models, proposed to capture human activity patterns, are
designed to capture the waiting times of the tasks, rather
than interevent times [3, 4, 22]. Therefore, placing them
on the phase diagram is not meaningful. A bursty signal
can be generated by 2-state model [23], switching with
probability p its internal state between Poisson processes
with two diﬀerent rates λ0 < λ1. ∆ for the model is inde-
pendent of p in the long time limit as long as p > 0, and
takes its value in the range 0 < ∆ < 0.5, approaching
0 when λ0 ≈ λ1 and 0.5 as λ1 → ∞ and λ0 → 0. The
memory coeﬃcient of the model follows µ = A(0.5 − p),
where A is a positive constant dependent on λ0 and λ1
so that −1/3 < µ < 1/3. The region in the (µ, ∆) space
occupied by the model is shown in the light grey area
in Fig. 3a, suggesting that by changing its parameters
the model could account for all observed behaviors. Yet,

the agreement is misleading: for example, for human ac-
tivities P (τ ) is fat-tailed, which is not the case for the
model. This indicates that ∆ and µ oﬀer only a ﬁrst or-
der approximation for the origin of the burstiness, and
for a detailed comparison between models and real sys-
tems we need to inspect other measures as well, such as
the functional form of P (τ ).
It also indicates the lack
of proper modeling tools to capture the detailed mech-
anisms responsible for the bursty interevent time distri-
butions seen in real systems, opening up possibilities for
future work.

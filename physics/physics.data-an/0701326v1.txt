Transitions in the dynamics of complex systems can be characterized by changes in the synchro-
nization behavior of their components. Taking the human cardio-respiratory system as an example
and using an automated procedure for screening the synchrograms of 112 healthy subjects we study
the frequency and the distribution of synchronization episodes under diﬀerent physiological condi-
tions that occur during sleep. We ﬁnd that phase synchronization between heartbeat and breathing
is signiﬁcantly enhanced during non-rapid-eye-movement (non-REM) sleep (deep sleep and light
sleep) and reduced during REM sleep. Our results suggest that the synchronization is mainly due
to a weak inﬂuence of the breathing oscillator upon the heartbeat oscillator, which is disturbed
in the presence of long-term correlated noise, superimposed by the activity of higher brain regions
during REM sleep.

Periodic events are ubiquitous in many natural sys-
tems [1]. If two oscillatory processes are weakly coupled,
they can become phase synchronized. Transitions in the
synchronization behavior have been shown to be impor-
tant characteristics of coupled oscillatory model systems
[2]. It has also been found that noise, when applied iden-
tically to diﬀerent nonlinear oscillators, can induce, en-
hance, or destroy synchronization among them [3, 4, 5].
However, phase synchronization is diﬃcult to study in ex-
perimental data which are very often inherently nonsta-
tionary and thus contain only quasiperiodic oscillations.
Among the few recent experimental studies are coupled
electrochemical oscillators [4], laser systems [5], and cli-
mate variables [6].
In physiology, the study of phase
synchronization focusses on cardio-respiratory data (see
below) and encephalographic data [7]. Here, in order
to obtain reliable experimental evidences of transitions
in phase synchronization behavior, we consider cardio-
respiratory synchronization in humans during sleep, be-
cause homogeneous long-term data for well deﬁned con-
ditions of a complex system is available in this particular
example.

First approaches for the study of cardio-respiratory
synchronization have been undertaken by the analysis
of the relative position of inspiration within the corre-
sponding cardiac cycle [8]. More recently, phase synchro-
nization between heartbeat and breathing has been stud-
ied during wakefulness using the synchrogram method
[9, 10, 11, 12]. While long synchronization episodes were
observed in athletes and heart transplant patients (sev-
eral hundreds of seconds) [10, 11], shorter episodes were
detected in normal subjects (typical duration less than
hundred seconds) [11, 12, 13]. For two recent models of
cardio-respiratory synchronization, see [14, 15].

In this Letter we use the concept of phase synchroniza-
tion to develop an automated synchrogram based proce-
dure and study interactions between cardiac and respira-
tory oscillations under diﬀerent well-deﬁned physiological
conditions. We focus on the sleep stages, where external
stimuli are absent. It is well known that healthy sleep
consists of cycles of roughly 1-2 hours duration. Each
cycle is characterized by a sequence starting usually with
light sleep, followed by deep sleep and REM sleep (rapid
eye movement) [16]. We ﬁnd the intriguing result that
during REM sleep cardio-respiratory synchronization is
suppressed by approximately a factor of 3 compared with
wakefulness. On the other hand, during non-REM sleep,
it is enhanced by a factor of 2.4, again compared with
wakefulness. In addition, we ﬁnd that these signiﬁcant
diﬀerences between synchronization in REM and non-
REM sleep are very stable and occur in the same way
for males and females, independent of age and indepen-
dent of the body mass index (BMI). Hence it seems likely
that – similar to the long-term correlations [17] occurring
in both heartbeat [18] and breathing [19] during REM
sleep but not during non-REM sleep – the diﬀerences are
caused by the inﬂuence of the activity of higher brain
regions on both oscillators [20].

First, we developed an algorithm, which detects
epochs of synchronization automatically and systemat-
ically. The algorithm is applied on simultaneous records
of respiration (from a thermistor placed close to the sub-
ject’s nose) and heartbeat (from electrocardiograms) ob-
tained for 112 healthy subjects during sleep. The data
was recorded in the EU project SIESTA in several Euro-
pean sleep laboratories [21], and the average length of the
records is 7.9 hours with a standard deviation of 25 min-
utes. Sleep stages have been determined by visual evalu-

detector: (a) section of a typical synchrogram in raw form,

are detected as synchronization episodes if their durations

ation of electrophysiological recordings of brain activity
[16]. We can thus assign the synchronization episodes
to the speciﬁc sleep stages. In addition, we constructed
surrogate data by random combination of heartbeat and
breathing signals from diﬀerent subjects [11]. We found
that the total duration of the detected synchronization
episodes in real data is increased by a factor 2.3 as com-
pared with the surrogate data, suggesting that most of
the detected episodes are real [22].

Our algorithm for the detection of phase synchroniza-
tion episodes is based on the study of cardio-respiratory
synchrograms [9, 10, 11, 12]. For each record, the times tk
of heartbeats are mapped on the continuous cumulative
phase Φr(t) of the respiratory signal, which we obtain by
unfolding the phase of the Hilbert transform of the nor-
malized thermistor recording. Figure 1(a) shows a repre-
sentative synchrogram, where Φr(tk) mod 2π is plotted
versus tk. In case of n:1 synchronization (i. e., if n heart-
beats ﬁt to one breathing cycle) one observes n parallel
horizontal lines in the synchrogram [n = 3 in Fig. 1(a)].
In general, to ﬁnd diﬀerent ratios n:m of phase synchro-
nization, we plot Ψm(tk) = Φr(tk) mod 2πm versus tk.

While most earlier work relies on a visual evaluation
of the synchrograms [10, 12], we detect the episodes in
a fully systematic way. For each synchronization ratio
n:m we ﬁrst replace the n phase points Ψm(tk) in each
m respiratory cycles by the averages Ψm(tk) calculated

over the corresponding points in the time windows from
tk − τ /2 to tk + τ /2 [Fig. 1(b)]. In the second step, the
algorithm deletes all phase points Ψm(tk) where the mean
standard deviation of the n points in each m breathing
cycles, hσin, is larger than 2mπ/nδ. In the third step,
only the phase points Ψm(tk) in uninterrupted sequences
of durations exceeding T seconds are kept [Fig. 1(c)].

Figure 2(a) shows a comparison of the detected syn-
chronization rates in real data and in surrogate data
for several values of the parameter T . The ratio of the
mean percentage of synchronization in real data over the
mean percentage in surrogate data increases from 1.6 for
T = 20 s to 3.4 for T = 40 s. There is no generic limit
for T . However, we choose T = 30 s in order to keep
the number of arbitrary detection of synchronization at
an acceptable low level (≈ 1% in the surrogate data)
while at the same time still detecting synchronization
episodes during all kinds of sleep stages. In addition, for
T = τ = 30 s we have only one eﬀective time scale pa-
rameter, which is identical with the standardized time
frame used for the detection of sleep stages [16]. We note
that changing the parameter δ has a similar eﬀect on the
results as changing T , and we chose δ = 5 based on simi-
lar considerations as for T . Our results do hardly depend
on the duration τ of the initial running average.

When studying the percentages of

synchronized
episodes in real data separately during wakefulness, REM
sleep, and non-REM sleep we obtain a highly signiﬁcant
diﬀerence in the frequency of cardio-respiratory synchro-
nization between the two major physiological states dur-

ing sleep. We ﬁnd 3.8% synchronization in non-REM
sleep compared with just 0.6% in REM sleep – a diﬀer-
ence by a factor of 6.3. Wakefulness is clearly interme-
diate, since we ﬁnd 1.6% for it. Similar diﬀerences are
observed for other values of T and δ. Since our data
base contains records of 112 subjects, we can also study
synchronization separately for several age groups, several
groups with diﬀerent body mass index (BMI), and men
and women. Figures 2(b,c) show that the results, for
wakefulness, REM sleep, and non-REM sleep are prac-
tically the same for both genders, all BMI groups, and
all age groups, although both, heart rate and breathing
rate are known to depend on BMI and age. These results
prove that our ﬁnding of signiﬁcant diﬀerences between
the cardio-respiratory synchronization in REM and non-
REM sleep is very stable.

Similar stable diﬀerences between REM and non-REM
sleep were found in the correlation properties of both
heartbeat [18] and breathing [19] ﬂuctuations, but hardly
in the magnitude of these ﬂuctuations [20]. The diﬀer-
ences were attributed to the inﬂuence of the central ner-
vous system with its sleep stage regulation in higher brain
regions on the autonomous nervous system. The similar-
ity leads us to suggest that the diminished synchroniza-
tion during REM sleep is also caused by inﬂuences of
the central nervous system. As long as the heartbeat
oscillator and the breathing oscillator (as parts of the
autonomous nervous system) are only aﬀected by uncor-
related noise from higher brain regions, they run like two
weakly coupled oscillators – and they clearly show syn-
chronization as expected, possibly enhanced by the noise
[3]. However, if the higher brain regions are more ac-
tive and impose long-term correlated noise on the two
oscillators, as is the case during REM sleep, the noise
disturbs the emergence of synchronized patterns, lead-
ing to a drastic reduction of synchronization episodes.
Hence we suggest from the experimental data that cor-
related noise is rather suppressing synchronization while
uncorrelated noise might increase it.

Our interpretation is consistent with the result that
cardio-respiratory synchronization is enhanced in heart
transplanted patients, where correlated signals from the
brain can hardly aﬀect the heartbeat oscillator [11].
Hence, it supports that any relation of the synchroniza-
tion patterns with cardiac impairments can only be an
indirect one as reported recently [23]. Diminished long-
term correlated regulation activity might explain the in-
crease of synchronization in well-trained athletes [10],
where ﬂuctuations of heartbeat and breathing might be
avoided to optimize the cardiovascular system for opti-
mal performance.

In order to gain insight into the mechanism of cardio-
respiratory phase synchronization we have studied, again
for all 112 subjects, the distribution of the synchroniza-
tion ratios n:m, where n cardiac cycles are synchronized
with m breathing cycles. Figure 3 shows the normal-

synchronization ratios

FIG. 3: Normalized histograms of all detected synchroniza-
tion ratios as well as distributions of the frequency ratios be-
tween heartbeat and breathing during (a) wakefulness, (b)
REM sleep, (c) light sleep, and (d) deep sleep. Note that
4:1 synchronization is remarkably increased in light sleep and
deep sleep, whereas in REM sleep 3:1 synchronization dom-
inates. In (e) the quotient of the synchronization ratio his-
togram with the distribution of the frequency ratios is shown
for the original data (crosses) as well as for the surrogate data
(circles).

ized histograms of the synchronization ratios during (a)
wakefulness, (b) REM sleep, (c) light sleep, and (d) deep
sleep. The underlying continuous curves in Fig. 3(a-
d) show the distributions of the frequency ratios between
heartbeat and breathing independent of synchronization.
To clarify the eﬃciency of the synchronization mech-
anism, we show the quotient of the synchronization rate
histogram with the distribution of the frequency ratios
(crosses) in Fig. 3(e). When comparing with the corre-
sponding curve for surrogate data (circles) it becomes ob-
vious that n:1 synchronization is preferred. This involves
not just the common ratios of 3:1, 4:1, and 5:1, but also
clearly 6:1 synchronization. In particular, we do not ﬁnd
any indication of a suppression of 4:1 synchronization as
has been reported recently based on modelling [14]. This
suggests that the feedback from baroreceptors to the res-
piratory centers introduced in the model is probably not
very important in the healthy subjects we studied. The
synchronization ratios n:2 and n:3 are weakly eﬃcient
if n is low, but not eﬃcient at all for large values of n.
Hence, Fig. 3(e) proves that cardio-respiratory synchro-
nization is nearly limited to frequency ratios n:m with
very small m, but quite independent of the number of
heartbeats n.

¿From this behavior we suggest that the physiological
synchronization mechanism is mainly based on an inter-
action of the respiratory cycle upon heartbeat and not
vice versa. This assumption can explain the weak (or

absent) eﬃciency of n:m synchronization with m > 1.
If the heartbeat oscillator gets a synchronizing kick at
a particular phase of each respiratory cycle and m > 1,
only half or even less of the kicks coincide with a heart-
beat and thus n:m synchronization cannot be eﬀective.
The assumption is consistent with the result obtained
when studying the direction of synchronization in chil-
dren and adults [24] and in a recent model [15]. It is also
coherent with the result that synchronization is enhanced
under paced respiration [13].

In conclusion, we have studied cardio-respiratory phase
synchronization during diﬀerent well-deﬁned physiolog-
ical stages in sleep for a large data base of healthy
subjects. We observed clearly reduced synchronization
during REM sleep and enhanced synchronization during
non-REM sleep. The result is stable for all studied sub-
groups of subjects; it is neither aﬀected by gender, nor by
age, nor by BMI. Since REM and non-REM sleep diﬀer
mainly in the type of activity of higher brain centers, it
seems probable that the diﬀerences in cardio-respiratory
synchronization are caused by the more and less long-
term correlated regulation actions of the brain during
REM and non-REM, respectively. Heart rate and breath-
ing rhythm generators behave like two weakly coupled os-
cillators, where the coupling direction is from breathing
to heartbeat. They become synchronized if uncorrelated
noise is imposed from the brain while long-term corre-
lated noise disturbs the emergence of the synchronized
patterns. Hence, the experimental data suggests that
correlated noise is suppressing synchronization while un-
correlated noise might increase it.

[20] We note that there is very little (≈ 14%) increase in the
amplitude of heartbeat or breathing ﬂuctuations during
REM sleep when compared with non-REM sleep. The
changes in the synchronization behavior can thus not be
due to variations in the strength of the inﬂuences from
the brain. Rather they must be due to the correlation
structure imposed by these inﬂuences. Long-term correla-
tions are nearly absent in both, heartbeat and breathing
during non-REM sleep [18, 19].

bution integral probability and the p−value observed in an experiment is proposed, which is suitable
for both counting experiment and continuous test statistics.

INTRODUCTION

The statistical signiﬁcance of a signal in an exper-
iment of particle physics is to quantify the degree of
conﬁdence that the observation in the experiment ei-
ther conﬁrm or disprove a null hypothesis H0, in fa-
vor of an alternative hypothesis H1. Usually the H0
stands for known or background processes, while the
alternative hypothesis H1 stands for a new or a sig-
nal process plus background processes with respective
production cross section. This concept is very useful
for usual measurements that one can have an intuitive
estimation, to what extent one can believe the ob-
served phenomena are due to backgrounds or a signal.
It becomes crucial for measurements which claim a
new discovery or a new signal. As a convention in par-
ticle physics experiment, the ”5σ” standard, namely
5 is required to deﬁne
the statistical signiﬁcance S
the sensitivity for discovery; while in the cases S
3
(S
2), one may claim that the observed signal has
strong (weak) evidence.

However, as pointed out in Ref. [1], the concept of
the statistical signiﬁcance has not been employed con-
sistently in the most important discoveries made over
the last quarter century. Also, the deﬁnitions of the
statistical signiﬁcance in diﬀerent measurements diﬀer
from each other. Listed below are various deﬁnitions
for the statistical signiﬁcance in counting experiment
(see, for example, refs.

where n is the total number of the observed events,
which is the Poisson variable with the expectation
s + b, s is the expected number of signal events to
be searched, while b is the known expected number of
Poisson distributed background events. All numbers
are counted in the ”signal region” where the searched
signal events are supposed to appear.
In equation
(4) and (5) the k(α) is a factor related to the α
that the corresponding statistical signiﬁcance assumes
1
α acceptance for positive decision about signal ob-
servation, and k(0.5) = 0, k(0.25) = 0.66, k(0.1) =
1.28, k(0.05) = 1.64, etc [3]. In equation (6), N (0, 1)
is a notation for the normal function with the expec-
tation and variance equal to 0 and 1, respectively. On
the other hand, the measurements in particle physics
often examine statistical variables that are continu-
ous in nature. Actually, to identify a sample of events
enriched in the signal process, it is often important
to take into account the entire distribution of a given
variable for a set of events , rather than just to count
the events within a given signal region of values. In
this situation, I. Nasky [4] gives a deﬁnition of the
statistical signiﬁcance via likelihood function

Upon above situation, it is clear that we desire to
have a self-consistent deﬁnition for statistical signif-
icance, which can avoid the danger that the same
S value in diﬀerent measurements may imply virtu-
rally diﬀerent statistical signiﬁcance, and can be suit-
able for both counting experiment and continuous test
statistics. In this letter we propose a deﬁnition of the
statistical signiﬁcance, which could be more close to
the desired property stated above.

II. DEFINITION OF THE STATISTICAL
SIGNIFICANCE

−

In the PDG [5], the p

value is deﬁned to quantify
the level of agreement between the experimental data
and a hypothesis. Assume an experiment makes a
measurement for test statistic t being equal to tobs,
H0) if a
and t has a probability density function g(t
|
null hypothesis H0 is true. We futher assume that
large t values correspond to poor agreement between

the null hypothesis H0 and data, then the p
an experiment would be

−

value of

p(tobs) = P (t > tobs|

H0) =

∞

A very small p
esis H0.

−

value tends to reject the null hypoth-

−

Since the p

value of an experiment provides a mea-
sure of the consistency between the H0 hypothesis and
the measurement, our deﬁnition for statistical signiﬁ-
value in the following form
cance S relates with the p

under the assumption that the null hypothesis H0
represents that the observed events can be described
merely by background processes. Because a small
p
value means a small probability of H0 being true,
corresponds to a large probability of H1 being true,
one would get a large signal signiﬁcance S by this ex-
pression. The left side of equation (9) represents the
integral probability of the normal distribution in the
region within S standard deviation (Sσ), therefore,
this deﬁnition conforms itself to the meaning of that
the statistical signiﬁcance should to have. In such a
values are listed
deﬁnition, some correlated S and p
in Table I.

III. STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE IN
COUNTING EXPERIMENT

A group of particle physics experiment involves the
search for new phenomena or signal by observing a
unique class of events that can not be described by
background processes. One can address this problem
to that of a ”counting experiment”, where one identi-
ﬁes a class of events using well-deﬁned criteria, counts
up the number of observed events, and estimates the
average rate of events contributed by various back-
grounds in the signal region, where the signal events (if
exist) will be clustered. Assume in an experiment, the
number of signal events in the signal region is a Pois-
son variable with the expectation s, while the num-
ber of events from backgrounds is a Poisson variable

2

with a known expectation b without error, then the
observed number of events distributes as the Poisson
variable with the expectation s + b.
If the experi-
ment observed nobs events in the signal region, then
the p

value is

−
p(nobs) = P (n > nobs|

Then, the signal signiﬁcance S can be easily deter-
mined. Comparing this equation with equation (6)
given by Ref. [4], we found the lower limit of the inte-
gral is diﬀerent.

IV. STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE IN
CONTINUOUS TEST STATISTICS

The general problem in this situation can be ad-
dressed as follows. Suppose we identify a class of
events using well-deﬁned criteria, which are charac-
terized by a set of N observations X1, X2, , XN for a
random variable X. In addition, one has a hypothesis
to test that predicts the probability density function
~θ), where ~θ = (θ1, θ2, ..., θk) is a set of
of X, say f (X
|
parameters which need to be estimated from the data.
Then the problem is to deﬁne a statistic that gives a
measure of the consistency of the distribution of data
with the distribution given by the hypothesis.

≡

To be concrete, we consider the random variable
X is, say, an invariant mass, and the N observations
X1, X2, ..., XN give an experimental distribution of X.
( ~θs; ~θb),
Assuming parameters ~θ = (θ1, θ2, ..., θk)
where ~θs and ~θb represent the parameters belong to
signal (say, a resonance) and backgrounds contribu-
tion, respectively. We assume the null hypothesis H0
stands for that the experimental distribution of X
can be described merely by the background processes,
namely, the null hypothesis H0 speciﬁes ﬁxed values
for a subset of parameters ~θs. Therefore, the parame-
ters ~θ are restricted to lie in a subspace ω of its total
space Ω. On the basis of a data sample of size N from
~θ) we want to test the hypothesis H0 : ~θ belongs
f (X
|
to ω. Given the observations X1, X2, , XN , the like-
N
~θ). The maximum
lihood function is L =
of this function over the total space Ω is denoted by
L( ˆΩ); while within the subspace ω the maximum of
the likelihood function is denoted by L(ˆω), then we
L(ˆω)/L( ˆΩ). It can be
deﬁne the likelihood-ratio λ
shown that for H0 true, the statistic

is distributed as χ2(r) (r is the number of parameters
speciﬁed by H0) when the sample size N is large [6].
In equation (12) we use ln Lmax(s + b) and ln Lmax(b)
denoting L( ˆΩ) and L(ˆω), respectively. If λ turns out
to be in the neighborhood of 1, the null hypothesis
H0 is such that it renders L(ˆω) close to the maximum
L( ˆΩ), and hence H0 will have a large probability of
being true. On the other hand, a small value of λ will
indicates that H0 is unlikely. Therefore, the critical
region of λ is in the neighborhood of 0, corresponding
to large value of statistic t. If the measured value of
t in an experiment is tobs, from equation (8) we have
p

value

−

p(tobs) =

χ2(t; r)dt.

(13)

Therefore, in terms of equation (9), one can calculate
the signal signiﬁcance according to following expres-
sion:

N (0, 1)dx = 1

and immediately obtain

S = √tobs

= [2(ln Lmax(s + b)

ln Lmax(b))]1/2,

which is identical to the equation (7) given by Ref. [4].

V. SUMMARY

−

In this letter we proposed a deﬁnition for the sta-
tistical signiﬁcance by constructing a correlation be-
tween the normal distribution integral probability and
the p
value observed in an experiment, which is suit-
able for both counting experiment and continuous test
statistics. The explicit expressions to calculate the
statistical signiﬁcance for counting experiment and
continuous test statistics in terms of the Poisson prob-
ability and likelihood-ratio are given.

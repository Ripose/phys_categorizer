Amplifying Medium

Abstract

We report the studies of emission from a novel random amplifying medium that
we term a “L´evy Laser” due to the non-Gaussian statistical nature of its emission
over the ensemble of random realizations. It is observed that the ampliﬁcation is
dominated by certain improbable events that are “larger than rare”, which give the
intensity statistics a L´evy like “fat tail”. This, to the best of our knowledge, provides
the ﬁrst experimental realization of L´evy ﬂight in optics in a random amplifying
medium.

1 Introduction

Random variables having orders-of-magnitude large values, but with correspond-
ingly orders-of-magnitude small probabilities for their occurrence, are known to give non-
Gaussian statistics for their ﬂuctuations - the L´evy statistics [1]. For these larger-than-rare
events the variance diverges, and a single large event may typically dominate the sum of
large number of such random events. Many physical examples of L´evy statistics, or the
L´evy ﬂights, are realized in nature, for example, strange kinetics [2], anomalous diﬀusion
in living polymers [3], subrecoil laser cooling [4], rotating ﬂuid ﬂow [5] and interstellar
scintillations [6].

In the present work a Random Amplifying Medium (RAM) is shown to provide yet
another example of L´evy statistics of some physical interest. In a RAM, light scattering,
which is usually considered detrimental to laser action, can infact, lead to enhanced
ampliﬁcation and hence to lasing. Here we report some analytical and experimental results
on the anomalous ﬂuctuations of emission from a RAM pumped beyond a threshold of
gain. More speciﬁcally, we show that in the classical diﬀusive regime, as obtaining in our
systems, there is a crossover from the Gaussian to the L´evy statistics for the emission
intensity over the ensemble of realizations of the random medium. Also, the associated
L´evy exponent decreases with the increasing gain. An interesting ﬁnding is that the L´evy-
statistical ﬂuctuations are enhanced by embedding an amplifying ﬁber into the particulate
RAM. We also brieﬂy discuss the nature of these ﬂuctuations as distinct from those
observed in transport through passive random media.

A RAM normally consists of an active bulk medium, like an optically pumped laser
dye solution (for example Rhodamine in methanol) in which point-like (particulate) scat-
terers (rutile (TiO2) or polystyrene microspheres) are randomly suspended [7-17]. Unlike
the case of a conventional laser with external cavity mirrors providing resonant feedback,

1

in a RAM it is the multiple scattering of light that provides a non-resonant distributed
feedback (Fig 1), and hence the mirrorless lasing. The enhanced path-lengths within the
random medium may arise due to classical diﬀusion resulting from incoherent scattering
(dilute suspension of scatterers in a dye) [8-12,16], or due to incipient wave localization
with strong coherent scattering (for example semiconductor powder ZnO, GaN) [13-15].
In general, in a RAM operating in the incoherent diﬀusive regime, greater the refractive-
index mismatch, greater is the diﬀusive path-length enhancement, and hence greater the
ampliﬁcation. A clear signature of lasing in a RAM is the drastic spectral narrowing
(gain narrowing) of the emission from the system above a well deﬁned threshold of pump
power. In the dye-scatterer system, the threshold of the pump power, at which the emis-
sion linewidth collapses from a few tens of nanometer to a few nanometers, is almost two
orders of magnitude smaller in the system with scatterers than the one without. Further,
with the increase in the scatterer concentration, both, the linewidth and the pumping
threshold are observed to decrease drastically. The selection of the lasing wavelength,
however, arises here as a result of an optimization involving, for example, the wavelength-
dependent diﬀusion coeﬃcient (or the localization length scale) and the spectral proﬁle
of the pumped dye.

An important aspect of the random lasing is that for a high gain (pumping) the
randomness of the amplifying medium makes the emission ﬂuctuate strongly over the
diﬀerent microscopic realizations (complexions) of the randomness of the medium. This
shows up as non-self averaging ﬂuctuations of the observed lasing intensity as the medium
is varied over its random realizations, for example, by tapping the cuvette containing the
RAM. (This, of course, is quite diﬀerent from the inherent photon statistics of ﬂuctuations
in time observed for a given complexion [17]). Normally, i.e., for passive random media,
these “sample-to-sample” ﬂuctuations are Gaussian in nature. In this work we will be
concerned with ﬂuctuations in a RAM only.

To ﬁx the idea, consider a RAM with the scatterers dispersed densely and randomly
in an amplifying continuum. A spontaneously emitted photon is expected to diﬀuse with
a diﬀusion constant D = (1/3)cℓ, where ℓ is the elastic mean free path and c is the speed
of light in the medium. We assume classical diﬀusion as ℓ/λ ≫ 1 in our case, where, λ
is the optical wavelength. As the photon diﬀuses and eventually escapes, it undergoes
ampliﬁcation, or gain (multiplication) due to the optical pumping, and the associated
stimulated emission, which, of course, does not aﬀect D. Assuming for simplicity, a
spherical RAM (radius ‘a’), illuminated uniformly by a short pump-pulse at time t = 0,
the probability of escape of a photon from the surface at r = a, per unit time at time t is
given by (the ﬁrst-passage probability density)

pI(t) = −

ρ(r, t)4πr2dr ,

a

where, ρ(r, t) is the probability density of the diﬀusing photon, emitted spontaneously
at time t = 0 anywhere within the sample with a uniform initial probability density
(ρ0). Simple solution for the diﬀusion problem (with the absorbing boundary condition
at r = a) gives

Now, the arc path-length traversed in the diﬀusion time t is ct giving a gain factor g =

with αm = m2( π2ℓℓg
a2 ) ≡ the mth L´evy exponent. Thus, with increasing pumping (decreas-
ing gain length ℓg), the exponent αm decreases, the tail becomes fatter, and the variance
of g diverges for αm < 2, that happens ﬁrst for m = 1, i.e., for ( π2ℓℓg
a2 ) < 2. This leads to
the crossover from a ﬁnite variance (Gaussian) to a divergent variance (L´evy) limit. This
essentially describes the onset of L´evy ﬂuctuations as we increase optical pumping. It is
idealized in that only the photons spontaneously emitted at time t = 0 are considered.
These are ampliﬁed most anyway, and dominate the intensity at time t observed, for large
gains (high pump powers). Further, in our granular random media with grain size ≫ λ,
the random scattering is best described as random refractions at the interfaces. This can
give rise to random closed loops that can trap and enhance light as in a resonance. Also,
inasmuch as the escape rate is linked to the diﬀusion constant, one can expect the classical
Ruelle-Pollicott resonances giving pronounced structure to the ﬂuctuation statistics. We
have not addressed these issues here.

Before we proceed further (with experiments), let us clarify the meaning of “ﬂuctu-
ations” once more in our context. These are statistical ﬂuctuations over the ensemble of
realizations of the randomness (i.e., macroscopically identical RAMs). Of course, we can
invoke physically the idea of ergodicity and identify these ﬂuctuations as unfolding in dif-
ferent parametric contexts. Statistical ﬂuctuations of transmission/conductance though
passive random media are, of course, well known [18], where, for a macroscopic sample,
the classical ﬂuctuations are small relative to the wave-mechanical (or quantum) ﬂuctua-
tions due to coherent interference eﬀects. In the present case of strictly classical diﬀusion
(ℓ ≫ λ), the anomalously large ﬂuctuations are due entirely to the ampliﬁcation inherent
to a RAM.

The system that we have experimentally studied is a novel RAM, which we term
the F-RAM (Fiber-Random Amplifying Medium), inasmuch as the active medium is a
random aggregation of segments of dye-doped amplifying (one-dimensional) ﬁbers (Bicron,
red ﬂuorescent optical ﬁber) in a passive medium of air, granular starch etc. (Fig 2). These
plastic ﬁbers ﬂuoresce in the orange-red when pumped by green light that enters the ﬁbers
through their cylindrical surfaces anywhere along their lengths. The emitted ﬂuorescent
light is mainly guided along the length, and it emerges from either end ampliﬁed by a
factor that increases exponentially with the length of travel through the ﬁber. While
the random aggregation of the amplifying ﬁbers itself provides some scattering, the latter
was enhanced in our experiments by the addition of passive scatterers like non-active
ﬁber pieces or granular starch. Thus, the diﬀusion proceeds via random scattering and
wave-guidance.

Our initial experiments studied the emission from an F-RAM, made of amplifying
ﬁbers crushed to sub-millimeter sizes, both with and without long pieces of amplifying

3

ﬁbers embedded in it. Additionally, these were compared with an F-RAM consisting
of long pieces of amplifying ﬁbers embedded in a passive scattering medium. These
experiments and the observations are described in section 2. The Arrhenius cascade model
as also the L´evy microscope [19], to which the observed statistics of intensity ﬂuctuations
bear relevance, is described in section 3. The experimental realization of L´evy lasers,
i.e., F-RAMs with tailored length distribution, exhibiting the sample-to-sample L´evy
intensity ﬂuctuations, in the dilute and the dense limits, is described in section 4. Section
5 concludes the work.

2 Experiments in F-RAM

An F-RAM consisting of amplifying ﬁbers crushed to sub-millimeter sizes (which
serve both to amplify and scatter the light), was contained in a glass cuvette of size 1
cm×1 cm ×5 cm. This was pumped by 10 ns, 26 mJ pulses at 532 nm from a frequency
doubled Nd:YAG laser (Spectra Physics). Part of the pump beam was split oﬀ by a
beam-splitter to monitor the pump intensity that was maintained constant. The emission
from the sample was collected transverse to the pump beam and the spectrum analyzed
on a PC based spectrometer (Ocean Optics). The schematic of the experimental set-up
is shown in Fig 3. Lasing action was seen from this system above a pump threshold of
22 mJ (Fig 4). The complexion of the system was altered i.e. the sample was agitated,
so that diﬀerent random conﬁgurations were obtained, and the resulting emission spectra
were recorded.
In order to obtain good statistics, this was repeated till the emission
spectra for 420 diﬀerent complexions of the sample were obtained. A histogram was
then constructed; that is the probability P (I) 1 of obtaining intensity I was plotted as
a function of the intensity. The histograms shown for λ = 620 nm (emission peak) and
λ = 590 nm (oﬀ-peak) are both observed to be Gaussian (Fig 5(a,b)). The intensity as a
function of complexion for these wavelengths show small ﬂuctuations (Fig 5(c,d)).

Ten long pieces (length 6 mm) of amplifying ﬁbers were then added to the above
F-RAM, and in a similar fashion the spectra for 420 diﬀerent complexions of the sample
recorded. A typical spectrum of this F-RAM is shown in Fig 6. Unlike the earlier case,
the histogram at λ = 640 nm (peak) shows a marked departure from the Gaussian in the
form of a long fat tail (Fig 7(a)). In addition, the intensity as a function of complexion
In contrast, at λ = 590 nm (oﬀ-peak),
showed sudden large ﬂuctuations (Fig 7(c)).
the intensity ﬂuctuations remained small (Fig 7(d)) and the histogram Gaussian (Fig
7(b)). The departure from the normally observed Gaussian statistics and the sudden
large intensity ﬂuctuations at the peak emission wavelength (640 nm) can be explained
as arising from the few long pieces of amplifying ﬁber, that, in some complexions of the
sample, provide large gain resulting in the fat tail. This was veriﬁed by studying another
system that consisted of a passive scattering bulk medium (white ﬁber pieces, length ∼
1 mm), in which ﬁve pieces of amplifying ﬁber (length 6 mm) were embedded, at pump
energy of ∼ 12 mJ. The presence of the pieces of amplifying ﬁber, though not visually
apparent, is evident from the intensity statistics of the emitted spectra as a long tail in
the histogram at λ = 640 nm (Fig 8(a)) and corresponding large intensity ﬂuctuations
over diﬀerent complexions (Fig 8(c)). On the other hand, the histogram and the intensity
ﬂuctuations at λ = 590 nm (Figs 8(b,d)) show Gaussian statistics. It is thus clear that
1P (I) is the number of times an intensity was recorded normalized to the total number of spectra.

a few long pieces of amplifying ﬁber dominate the emission by their large, but rare,
ampliﬁcation so much so that the presence of a few long amplifying pieces hidden inside
a bulk aggregate of small pieces (active or passive) can be inferred from the sample-to-
sample ﬂuctuations in the emission from the system. This feature may be used to probe
a relatively long piece of amplifying ﬁber hidden inside a RAM thus L´evy microscope 2.

3 The Arrhenius cascade

exp( −U
Uo

As the above experiments on F-RAMs indicate that a few large events dominate the
emission statistics, we are led to the related problem of the Arrhenius cascade, which we
discuss in brief. The Arrhenius cascade studies the time of descent of a particle down an
incline that has a series of potential wells of varying random depths, U, occurring with
probability pU (U) = 1
) (Uo is the mean depth) (Fig 9(a): dotted). In a well of
Uo
depth U, the particle spends a time t, with τ = t
kT ) (Fig 9(a): solid). Thus,
to
though deep wells are exponentially improbable, their presence increases the residence
time exponentially. It can be shown that in the asymptotic limit, the total time of descent
follows the power law pτ (τ ) ∼ τ (−1−α) where, α = kT
. For high temperature (T ), or for
Uo
α ≥ 2, the particle has a fast descent and the resulting distribution pτ (τ ) is Gaussian.
For 0 < α < 2, corresponding to intermediate or low temperatures, the distribution is
L´evy (Fig 9(b)) and the Central Limit Theorem is violated.

= exp( U

To exploit the fact that two functions, one exponentially increasing and the other
exponentially falling, can combine to give rise to Gaussian or L´evy statistics depending
on the relative values of the two exponents, we tailored our F-RAM system, such that
the probability distribution of the lengths of the ﬁbers was pℓ(ℓ) = 1
), as shown
ℓo
in Fig 10. (Note that this tailored F-RAM is diﬀerent from those described in section 2
where all long amplifying ﬁber pieces were of same length). The ampliﬁcation within an
active ﬁber results in an intensity I(ℓ) = Io exp( ℓ
). Thus,
ℓg
long ﬁbers, though exponentially rare, provide exponentially high gain 3.

ℓo

It can be shown that the probability distribution of the resultant gain acquired by
the photon is given as pg(g) ∼ g(−1−ν) where, ν = ℓg
. It is thus expected that 0 < ν < 2
ℓo
gives L´evy intensity statistics and ν ≥ 2 Gaussian. We demonstrate experimentally, in
the next section, the crossover from Gaussian to L´evy as ℓg is reduced.

4 Experiments with tailored F-RAM (L´evy Laser)

Experiments were conducted on tailored F-RAMs with N pieces (N = 350, 800)
of amplifying ﬁbers in passive scattering media provided by suspension of polystyrene
microspheres in water (BangsLabs, mean diameter = 0.13 µm, number density = 9.357 ×
1012/cc), granular starch or pieces of white optical ﬁber (non-amplifying, length ∼ 0.5
mm to 1 mm). In all three systems (contained in glass cuvettes of size 30 mm× 30 mm
× 60 mm) were studied in which, the lengths of the amplifying ﬁbers ranged from 1 mm
to 20 mm and followed an exponential distribution with ℓo = 5 mm.

2The term “L´evy microscope” will become clearer after section 3
3Note that the parameters ℓo and ℓg in the tailored F-RAM correspond to Uo and kT respectively in

the Arrhenius cascade

As described in section 2, spectra (at pump energies ∼ 6-9 mJ) for ∼ 360 diﬀerent
complexions of each of the systems were obtained and analyzed. The intensity ﬂuctua-
tions and the corresponding histograms are given in Figs 11 to 13. These are shown for
λ = 645 nm and 590 nm, the former corresponding to the peak emission wavelength,
where the gain is maximum (ℓg is minimum), and the latter to oﬀ-peak wavelength (ℓg
is large). The histograms of all three systems show a L´evy-like fat tail at the peak emis-
sion wavelength; therefore these tailored F-RAMs are termed L´evy lasers. In contrast, at
oﬀ-peak wavelengths, the histograms show Gaussian statistics consistent with the larger
value of ν. The intensity at the peak wavelength (645 nm) as a function of complexion
showed sudden large jumps, typical of L´evy ﬂights. This feature was absent at oﬀ-peak
wavelengths.

We now distinguish between the “dilute” and the “dense” limits of the L´evy Laser.
The dilute L´evy Laser contains a few pieces of amplifying ﬁbers. A photon originating
within a given piece of amplifying ﬁber gains in intensity as it traverses the ﬁber. Upon
exiting the ﬁber, it diﬀuses through the passive surrounding medium and exits the sample
with a negligible probability of encountering another amplifying ﬁber (Fig 14(a)). The
intensity collected in the experiment is the sum of various such intensities - the additive
gain. As discussed earlier, it gives a power-law for the gain i.e., pg(g) ∼ g−1−ν. Of the
systems studied, the case with N = 350 amplifying ﬁbers in polystyrene scattering medium
corresponds to a dilute system. The tail of the histogram can be ﬁtted to a power law
function (g−1−ν) with exponent 1 + ν = 2.69 i.e., ν = 1.69.

In the dense L´evy laser, on the other hand, a photon, upon exiting an amplifying
ﬁber, has a high probability of entering another amplifying ﬁber and getting further
ampliﬁed before ﬁnally exiting the sample (Fig 14(b)). In such a case, the total intensity
(or gain) is multiplicative rather than additive i.e. G = Πi gℓi = Πi exp( ℓi
), where, the
ℓg
index, i, runs over all ﬁbers that a given photon traverses through, from which we get
px(x) ∼ g−ν where, x = ln gℓi. Thus, the dense system with multiplicative gain also gives
rise to a L´evy distribution, but with a tail that falls oﬀ slower than the dilute system.
Cases with N = 800 amplifying ﬁbers in passive scattering media are realizations of dense
L´evy lasers. The tails of the histograms can be ﬁtted to the power law function (g−ν) with
exponents ν = 0.62 and 1.68, for systems with passive scattering medium as non-active
white ﬁber pieces and granular starch respectively.

5 Conclusions

We have demonstrated a new RAM, namely the F-RAM, that is notably diﬀerent from
a conventional RAM in several aspects. As opposed to the RAM that has a bulk active
medium (dye solution) with suspended passive point-like scatterers, an F-RAM, has an
active medium that is one-dimensional (pieces of amplifying ﬁber) and is suspended in the
passive bulk medium. Further, unlike the conventional RAM, during its traversal through
the passive bulk medium in an F-RAM the photon does not get ampliﬁed. Consequently, a
greater refractive index mismatch between the active (ﬁber) and the passive (bulk) media,
which in the case of RAM leads to greater ampliﬁcation due to increased path-length, is
likely to result under some conditions in just the opposite in an F-RAM, as it enhances
scattering oﬀ the active ﬁber. We term an F-RAM with a tailored distribution of ﬁber
lengths, where long amplifying pieces are exponentially rare, a “L´evy Laser”, because the

6

sample-to-sample intensity ﬂuctuations exhibit L´evy statistics. The “larger than rare”
ampliﬁcation in such systems makes feasible a “L´evy microscope” that can pick out the
presence of, and study the characteristics of a long piece of amplifying ﬁber embedded in
a bulk of smaller (active or passive) pieces.

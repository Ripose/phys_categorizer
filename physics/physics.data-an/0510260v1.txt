1 Introduction

There has been a long-standing discussion concerning foundations of spe-
[1] ÷ [3] ). As a result there
cial relativity (SR) (see, for example, Refs.
is at present no doubt that the basic assumptions of SR can be formulated
in a way independent on any convention concerning clock synchronization.
One can also hardly believe that Einstein was unaware of this fact, although
he used the speciﬁc, simple and elegant, synchronization scheme. Within
this scheme the notion of simultaneity has relative, i.e. depending on the
reference frame, character. The absence of absolute simultaneity is slightly
disturbing if confronted with causality principle because the latter is formu-
lated in terms of time ordering for space-time events. Not only seems the
causality principle to be observer-dependent but also synchronization (i.e.
convention) -dependent which is even more serious. The way out of this
dilemma is simple and well-known: once we assume that all particles and
interactions propagate inside (or on the surface of) the light cone the only
revelant structure entering the theory is the geometry of the set of light cones
including the possibility of invariant distiction between ”past” and ”future”
cones which allows for invariant deﬁnition of causality. No synchronization
scheme, always based on some convention, is needed; in particular, we don’t
have to refer to the notion of simultaneity. This is because the light cones are
geometric objects not depending on the choice of coordinates in space-time.
The theory becomes elegant, simple and explicitly convention-independent.
There are sometimes claims that the situation changes when quantum
theory enters the game and some synchronization is then distinguished. We
don’t believe this is the case but we will not dwell on this problem here.

Once the propagation outside the light cones is allowed we are faced with
serious troubles. Such egzotic signals could be used to synchronize the dis-
tant clocks and the problem whether the choice of particular synchronization
scheme is a matter of convenction becomes more complicated. The clarity
and elegance of Einstein’s SR is lost and the theory lacks nice geometric
interpretation.

All these condusion, scattered in the literature were clearly expressed
more than fourty years ago in the elegant and concise paper due to Edwards
[4]. Since that time a number of papers have appeared (see, for example
[5], [6]) where some partial results of Ref. [4] are discussed. The aim of the
present paper is to remind the results of [4] by putting them in more general
setting and explaining their group-theoretical meaning.

2 Synchronization

Let us consider some reference frame which includes also a deﬁnite synchro-
nization of distant cloks. We shall assume that the space is homogeneous
but anisotropic in the sense that the light velocity depends only on the di-
rection of ray propagation. Let c(~n) be the light velocity in the direction
~n (| ~n |= 1). Our basic assumption is that the average velocity over any
closed path equals always c, the velocity of light in Einstein’s theory. This
assumption is obviously independent on the choice of synchronization.
First, we rederive the Edwards result concerning the form of the function
c(~n). Consider any piecewise smooth closed oriented path γ; in principle, we
should rather consider piecewise linear paths realized by the set of properly
plased mirrors but this is inrelevant.
Our assumption implies the following equality to hold for any such path

here ~n points in the tangent direction at a given point of the curve γ.
Introducing the dimensionless function

one rewrites (1) in the form

which holds for any closed path γ. Eq.(3) implies, as usual, that for any path
γ starting at P0 and terminating at P1 the integral

depends only on the initial and ﬁnal points P0 and P1. Fixing P0 one deﬁnes

where the integral is taken along arbitrary path connecting P0 and ~x. Eq.(5)
implies, in turn, the following equality to hold for any path γ

Therefore,

R(~n)ds =

~∇F (~x) · ~nds

Zγ

Zγ

R(~n) = ~∇F (~x) · ~n

which is only possible provided

R(~n) = ~k · ~n,

(8)
~k being dimensionless and constant. Taking into account the deﬁnition of
R(~n) one obtains ﬁnally

~F (~x) = ~k · ~x (+const),

Following Edwards we assume c(~n) > 0 (but exclude the case c(~n) = ∞ for
some ~n, considered also by Edwards); consequently

Now, it is easy to show that one can always change the synchronization such
that the one-way velocity of light is c, i. e. ce(~n) ≡ c, where ce(~n) corresponds
to new synchronization. To this end deﬁne new space-time coordinates

c(~n) =

(12)

One concludes that the assumption that the average light velocity over closed
paths equals c implies the existence of Einstein clock synchronization in which
one-way velocity of light also always equals c. Therefore, the special relativity
follows from the invariance of average closed-part light velocity.

3 Generalized Lorentz (Edwards) transforma-

tions

It is now straightforward to derive the Edwards transformations relating ref-
erence frames with arbitrary synchronization. This amounts only to rewrite
the standard Lorentz transformations in terms of new variables. First, using
eqs.(11) we ﬁnd the relation between velocities in both synchronizations

here ~v is the relative velocity while ~k and ~k′ deﬁne synchronizations in both
frames.

As mentioned above, one of the main features of Einstein synchronization
is the relative charakter of simultaneity. Now, one can pose the question if
there exists synchronization procedure making the notion of simultaneity
absolute. To answer it we put t = 0 and ask under what condition this
implies t′ = 0. It follows from eqs.(14) that this is possible only provided

In order to put eq.(16) in more familiar form we deﬁne new velocity variable
~u ≡ k~c (| ~u |< c) and express ~v in terms of ~ve (of. eq.(13)). Then (16) takes
the form

~u′ = q

(cid:19) (cid:16)

(cid:17)

which is just the Einstein addition formula for velocites [7]. Therefore, we
can think on ~u as the velocity of the actual reference frame with respect to
some ﬁxed frame called the ”preferred” one; note that ~u = ~ue because in the
preferred frame synchronization reduces to the standard one.
One condudes that the most general deﬁnition of absolute simultaneity is
that one selects a ﬁxed but arbitrary reference frame (”preferred” frame)
with standard synchronization and calls two events simultaneous if they are
simultaneous in prefered frame.

4 Group theory of Edwards transformations

Let us remind some facts about the geometry of Lorentz group. Denoting
e ≡ cte and gµν = gµν = diag(+ − −−) one deﬁnes Lorentz transformation
x0
as a general linear transformation

leaving invariant the quadratic form

Eqs. (18), (19) imply the following constraints on Λµ

Therefore, the general Lorentz transformation depends on six parameters
which parametrize Lorentz boosts (components of relative velocity ~ve ) and
rotations (three angles).
Any Lorentz matrix can be represented as the product of two matrices repre-
senting pure boost and rotation. Indeed, the following identity can be easily
checked using eqs.(20)

Both ˜Λ and R obey (20) and R is an orthogonal matrix. The latter means
that R describes rotation. On the other hand, ˜Λ is symmetric. Due to the

which leads to standard Lorentz boost (eq.(14) with ~k = 0 = ~k′.
Let Λ(~ve) be pure boost; Λ(~ve) is a symmetric matrix. For generic ~ve1, ~ve2, Λ(~ve1)

7

and Λ(~ve2) do not commute. Therefore, their product is, in general, not sym-
metric, i.e. it is not a pure boost; in fact, using the decomposition (21) one
ﬁnds

Λ(~ve1)Λ(~ve2) = Λ(~ve1 ⊕ ~ve2)R(~ve1, ~ve2)

(27)

here ~ve1 ⊕ ~ve2 denotes Einstein sum of velocities while R(~ve1, ~ve2) describes
the rotation giving rise to the so called Thomas precession.
It is also easy to check that

The general composition rule can be now obtained from (21), (27), (28):

RΛ(~ve) = Λ(R~ve)R

Λ1Λ2 = (˜Λ(~ve1)R1)(˜Λ(~ve2)R2) =
= ˜Λ(~ve1)˜Λ(R1~ve2)R1R2 =
= ˜Λ(~ve1 ⊕ R1~ve2)R(~ve1, R1~ve2)R1R2

(28)

(29)

Let us now explain the group-theoretical meaning of Edwards transforma-
tions (14). Physically it is obvious that they are equivalent to the standard
Lorentz ones. However, they cannot be obtained from the latter by a simple
redeﬁnition of space-time coordinates. In fact, such redeﬁnition involves the
quantity ~k which, in turn, depends on the choice of reference frame. So there
exists no change of space-time coordinates reducing Edwards transformations
to Lorentz ones. On the other hand, the physical equivalence of synchroniza-
tion procedures must be reﬂected somehow in matematical formalism.
We start with the following simple remark. Let us ﬁx some reference frame
with standard synchronization. Any other standard frame can be obtained
by applying the uniquely deﬁned Lorentz transformation. Therefore, the to-
tality of all standard inertial reference frames can be parametrized by the
coordinates of Lorentz group manifold, i.e. by three components of relative
velocity ~ve and three angles of the rotation matrix R.
The totality of all coordinates of space-time points in all interial frames is now
parametrized as follows. Let us select an arbitrary reference frame and let
Λ(~u, R) = ˜Λ(~u)R be the unique Lorentz transformation which leads to this
frame when applied to the preferred one. The space-time coordinates with
respect to the preferred frame are denoted by xµ
p . For any space-time point its
coordinates with respect to the actual reference frame will be parametrized
by ~u, R and xµ
p -the coordinates of this point in preferred frame. It is easy

8

to check that the action of the Lorentz group, when expressed in new coor-
dinates, reads

~u → ~ve ⊕ R~u

(30)

Λ(~ve, R) : R → R(~ve, R~u)RR
p → xµ
xµ
p

Which means that (~u, R) transform according to the left action of Lorentz
group on itself while xµ
p are Lorentz invariants. The reader familiar with the
theory of nonlinear group realizations [8] will immediately recongize in (31)
the canonical form of nonlinear realizations of Lorentz group which linearize
on its trivial subgroup. Replacing the coordinates xµ

p by

e ≡ Λµ
xµ

ν(~u, R)xν
p

e transform in the standard way under Lorentz transforma-

one ﬁnds that xµ
tions, again in accordance with the general theory [8].
The quantities ~k deﬁning synchronization depend on the choice of reference
frame,

Now, according to the formula (11) one deﬁnes new coordinates

~k = ~k(~u, R)

xµ ≡ T µ

ν(~u, R)Λν

p

where

p ) and (~u, R, xµ

Since T is invertible, (~u, R, xµ) provide equally good choice of parametrization
as (~u, R, xµ
e ). The transformation rules involve now the left
action of Lorentz group for (~u, R) and Edwards transformations (14) for xµ.
Contrary to the canonical choice (xµ
p ) and the one that linearizes the action
of the whole group in the spirit of Ref.[8], (xµ
e ), in this case the variables
(~u, R) and xµ do not decouple.
For some particular choices of ~k one can obtain more general form of nonlinear

9

realizations of Lorentz group. This is, for example, the case for the ~k deﬁned
as

~k =

~u
c

(35)

(36)

(16)). Then ~k is a function on coset space
(cf. discussion below eq.
Lorentz/rotation subgroup. One considers the totality of reference frames
obtained by applying pure boosts to the preferred one:

e = Λµ
xµ

ν(~u)xν

p ≡ ˜Λµ

ν(~u)xν
p

Then

p =

ν(~v, R)xν

ν(~v, R)Λν
̺(~v, R~u)R̺

e = Λµ
ν(~v ⊕ R~u)Rν

̺(~u)x̺
σxσ
p
which implies that ~u transform as ”goldstonic” and xµ
p as adjoint coordinates
according to the terminology of Ref.[8]. The action linearizes on rotation
subgroup while xµ
e are the new coordinates on which full Lorentz group acts
linearly, again in the spirit of general theory. Let us note that one can
even here consider the totality of all intertial frames by replacing eq.(36)
by eq.(31). The rotation parameters entering R play, however, the role of
spectators: for any R, R

p are adjoint coordinates.
Edwards transformations are now again obtained by passing to the new

µ
νxν

coordinates

xµ = T µ

ν(~u)Λν

α(~u)xα
p

(38)

Let us notice that in the second Ref.[6] the Edwards transformations for the
very particular choice ~k = ~u
c were also considered from the point of viev of
nonlinear realizations.

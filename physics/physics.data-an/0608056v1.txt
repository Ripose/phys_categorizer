We use some fractal analysis methods to study river ﬂow ﬂuctuations. The result of the Multi-
fractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA) shows that there are two crossover timescales in
the ﬂuctuation function. We discuss how the existence of the crossover timescales are related to a
sinusoidal trend. The ﬁrst crossover is due to the seasonal trend and the value of second ones is
approximately equal to the well known cycle of sun activity. Using Fourier detrended ﬂuctuation
analysis, the sinusoidal trend is eliminated. The value of Hurst exponent of the runoﬀ water of
rivers without the sinusoidal trend show a long range correlation behavior. For the Daugava river
the value of Hurst exponent is 0.52 ± 0.01 and also we ﬁnd that these ﬂuctuations have multifractal
nature. Comparing the MF-DFA results for the remaining data set of Daugava river to those for
shuﬄed and surrogate series, we conclude that its multifractal nature is almost entirely due to the
broadness of probability density function.

I. INTRODUCTION

Interpretation and estimation of climate change has
been one of the main research areas in science [1–3]. The
climate system often exhibits irregular and complex be-
havior. Although the climate system is driven by the
well-deﬁned seasonal periodicity, it is also a subject to
unpredictable perturbations which can lead to extreme
climate events. Indeed the climate is a dynamical system
inﬂuenced by immense factors, such as solar radiation or
the topography of the surface of the solid earth, etc. All
factors that control the trajectory of climate have enor-
mously large phase space, thus we have to analysis it
with stochastic tools. Several recent statistical studies
have shown that a remarkably wide variety of natural
systems display ﬂuctuations that may be characterized
by long-range power-law correlations. Such correlations
hint toward fractal geometry of the underlying dynamical
system. Existence and determination of power-law cor-
relations would help to quantify the underlying process
dynamics [4,5].

The analysis of river ﬂows has a long history, neverthe-
less some important issues have been lost. Here, we study
one component of the climate system, the river ﬂux, by
using the novel approach. The statistical and fractal
analysis of river ﬂows should be an important issue in
the geophysics and hydrological systems to recognize the
inﬂuence of environmental conditions and to detect rel-
ative eﬀects. A set of most important results which can
be given by using statistical tools is as follows: a concept
of scale self-similarity for the topography of Earth’s sur-
face [6], the hydraulic-geometric similarity of river system
and ﬂoods forced by the heavy rain [7,8], etc. Already
more than half a century ago the engineer Hurst found

that runoﬀ records from various rivers exhibit ’long-range
statistical dependencies’ [9]. Later, such long-term cor-
related ﬂuctuation behavior has also been reported for
many other geophysical records including precipitation
data [6,10,11]. These original approaches exclusively fo-
cused on the absolute values or the variances of the full
distribution of the ﬂuctuations, which can be regarded
as the ﬁrst and second moments of detrended ﬂuctuation
analysis [6,9,10,12]. In the last decade it has been real-
ized that a multifractal description is required for a full
characterization of the runoﬀ records [13,14]. This mul-
tifractal description of the records can be regarded as a
’ﬁngerprint’ for each station or river, which, among other
things, can serve as an eﬃcient non-trivial test bed for
the state-of-the-art precipitation-runoﬀ models.

River ﬂow can be characterized by several general fea-
tures. As a result of the periodicity in precipitation, river
ﬂow has also strong seasonal periodicity. The seasonal
cycle of river ﬂow is asymmetric; i.e., river ﬂow increases
rapidly (usually during late winter and spring) and de-
creases gradually (toward the end of the autumn). The
ﬂuctuations in river ﬂow are large for large river ﬂow
and small for small river ﬂow (see Figure 1). It is im-
portant to note that unlike other climate components,
river ﬂow may has a direct impact of human activity,
like damming, use of river water for agriculture, etc., a
fact which makes the river ﬂow data more diﬃcult to
study. The ﬂuctuations in river ﬂow are of special inter-
est since they are directly linked to ﬂoods and droughts.
There are several interesting characteristics of river ﬂow
ﬂuctuations: (i) the river ﬂow ﬂuctuations have power
law tails in the probability distribution [15,16], (ii) the
river ﬂow ﬂuctuations are long-range correlated [9,17,18],
and (iii) river ﬂow ﬂuctuations are multifractal [13,14,19].

The scaling laws may improve the statistical prediction
of extreme changes in river ﬂow [20]. Using the volatility
series ,the degree of non-linearity has been checked, also
a simple model of river ﬂuctuations has been determined
[4,5]. More recently the annual runoﬀ for the Ukrainian
and Moldavia’s rivers and reveal scale invariance for dis-
tribution of this variable have been investigated by using
statistical parameters such as arithmetic average, coef-
ﬁcients of variation, skewness, and auto-correlation [21].
In all of the previous researches, the contribution sinu-
soidal trends on the creation of crossover in the results
of fractal analysis and the multifractal nature have been
lost. More recently the eﬀect of nonstationarity on the
detrended ﬂuctuation analysis has been investigated [22].
So the main purpose of this paper are the investigation of
the eﬀects of seasonal trend on the multifractal analysis
of ﬂow ﬂuctuations and determination of the source of
multifractality in data . For completeness of this inves-
tigation and to get the deep insight of the contribution
of sun activity in the statistical properties of river ﬂow,
we compare the recent fractal analysis results of sunspots
[23] with current analysis. The Sunspot number was col-
lected by the Sunspot Index Data Center (SIDC) [24].
It was well-known that the statistical properties of ev-
ery rivers depend on very important reasons which aﬀect
on ﬂow ﬂuctuations, so it is not expected that the sun
activity has a same reasonable eﬀect on diﬀerent rivers.
In addition we would like to characterize the complex
behavior of the monthly runoﬀ for the Daugava river ﬂuc-
tuations through the computation of the signal parame-
ters - scaling exponents - which quantiﬁes the correlation
exponents and multifractality of the signal. We inves-
tigate the correlation behavior of duct river time series
which is governed by power-law.

The original Daugava river data source is Latvian
Environmental Geological and Meteorological Agency
database. They describe water ﬂow through hydroelec-
tric power station near K¸ egums, Latvia. Dimension of
the data is m3/s. Other data which are used here are
from National Water Information System: Web Inter-
face [25]. As shown in Figure 1, the duct water of Dau-
gava river series has a sinusoidal trend, with a domi-
nated frequency. These trends should involve the sea-
sonal and other physical reasons in natural phenomenon.
Because of the complexity nature of river ﬂow series,
and due to the ﬁniteness of the available data sample,
we should apply some methods which are insensitive to
non-stationarities like trends. To eliminate the eﬀect of
sinusoidal trend, we apply the Fourier Detrended Fluc-
tuation Analysis (F-DFA) [26,27]. After elimination of
the trend we use the Multifractal Detrended Fluctua-
tion Analysis (MF-DFA) to analysis the data set. The
MF-DFA methods are the modiﬁed version of detrended
ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) to detect multifractal prop-
erties of time series. The detrended ﬂuctuation analysis
(DFA) method introduced by Peng et al. [28] has be-

came a widely-used technique for the determination of
(multi-) fractal scaling properties and the detection of
long-range correlations in noisy, nonstationary time se-
ries [22,28–31].
It has successfully been applied to di-
verse ﬁelds such as DNA sequences [28,32], heart rate
dynamics [33–35], neuron spiking [36], human gait [37],
long-time weather records [38], cloud structure [39], geol-
ogy [40], ethnology [41], economical time series [42], solid
state physics [43] and sunspot time series [23].

This paper is organized as follows: In Section II we
describe the MF-DFA, F-DFA and Scale Windowed Vari-
ance (SWV) methods in detail and show that the scal-
ing exponents determined via the MF-DFA method are
identical to those obtained by the standard multifractal
formalism based on partition functions. We eliminate the
sinusoidal trend via the F-DFA technique in Section III
and investigate the multifractal nature of the remaining
ﬂuctuation, we use certain fractal analysis approaches
such as, the Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analy-
sis (MF-DFA), and Scaled Windowed Variance (SWV)
to analysis the data set, The DFA result of sun activity
and river ﬂows are compared together.
In Section IV,
we examine the source of multifractality in duct water of
Daugava river data by comparison the MF-DFA results
for remaining data set to those obtained via the MF-DFA
for shuﬄed and surrogate series. Section V closes with a
discussion of the present results.

II. FRACTAL ANALYSIS METHODS

In this section we introduce three methods to investi-

gate the fractal properties of stochastic processes.

A. Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis

The simplest type of the multifractal analysis is based
upon the standard partition function multifractal for-
malism, which has been developed for the multifractal
characterization of normalized, stationary measurements
[44–47]. Unfortunately, this standard formalism does not
give correct results for nonstationary time series that are
aﬀected by trends or that cannot be normalized. Thus, in
the early 1990s an improved multifractal formalism has
been developed, the wavelet transform modulus maxima
(WTMM) method [48], which is based on the wavelet
analysis and involves tracing the maxima lines in the
continuous wavelet transform over all scales. The other
method, the multifractal detrended ﬂuctuation analysis
(MF-DFA), is based on the identiﬁcation of scaling of the
qth-order moments depending on the signal length and is
generalization of the standard DFA using only the second
moment q = 2.

B. Description of the MF-DFA

The modiﬁed multifractal DFA (MF-DFA) procedure
consists of ﬁve steps. The ﬁrst three steps are essentially
identical to the conventional DFA procedure (see e. g.
[22,28–31]). Suppose that xk is a series of length N , and
that this series is of compact support, i.e. xk = 0 for an
insigniﬁcant fraction of the values only.
• Step 1: Determine the “proﬁle”

i

Xk=1

Y (i) ≡

[xk − hxi] ,

i = 1, . . . , N.

(1)

Subtraction of the mean hxi is not compulsory, since it
would be eliminated by the later detrending in the third
step.
• Step 2: Divide the proﬁle Y (i) into Ns ≡ int(N/s) non-
overlapping segments of equal lengths s. Since the length
N of the series is often not a multiple of the considered
time scale s, a short part at the end of the proﬁle may
remain. In order not to disregard this part of the series,
the same procedure is repeated starting from the opposite
end. Thereby, 2Ns segments are obtained altogether.
• Step 3: Calculate the local trend for each of the 2Ns
segments by a least-square ﬁt of the series. Then deter-
mine the variance

The MF-DFA does not require the modulus maxima
procedure in contrast WTMM method, and hence does
not require more eﬀort in programming and computing
than the conventional DFA. On the other hand, often
experimental data are aﬀected by non-stationarities like
trends, which have to be well distinguished from the in-
trinsic ﬂuctuations of the system in order to ﬁnd the cor-
rect scaling behavior of the ﬂuctuations. In addition very
often we do not know the reasons for underlying trends
in collected data and even worse we do not know the
scales of the underlying trends, also, usually the avail-
able record data is small. For the reliable detection of
correlations, it is essential to distinguish trends from the
ﬂuctuations intrinsic in the data. Hurst rescaled-range
analysis [10] and other non-detrending methods work well
if the records are long and do not involve trends. But if
trends are present in the data, they might give wrong
results. Detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) is a well-
established method for determining the scaling behavior
of noisy data in the presence of trends without knowing

F 2(s, ν) ≡

{Y [N − (ν − Ns)s + i] − yν(i)}2 , (3)

for ν = Ns + 1, . . . , 2Ns. Here, yν(i) is the ﬁtting poly-
nomial in segment ν. Linear, quadratic, cubic, or higher
order polynomials can be used in the ﬁtting procedure
(conventionally called DFA1, DFA2, DFA3, . . .) [28,35].
Since the detrending of the time series is done by the
subtraction of the polynomial ﬁts from the proﬁle, dif-
ferent order DFA diﬀer in their capability of eliminating
trends in the series.
In (MF-)DFAm [mth order (MF-
)DFA] trends of order m in the proﬁle (or, equivalently,
of order m− 1 in the original series) are eliminated. Thus
a comparison of the results for diﬀerent orders of DFA al-
lows one to estimate the type of the polynomial trend in
the time series [22,30].
• Step 4: Average over all segments to obtain the q-th
order ﬂuctuation function, deﬁned as:

(7)

where, in general, the index variable q can take any real
value except zero. For q = 2, the standard DFA proce-
dure is retrieved. Generally we are interested in how the
generalized q dependent ﬂuctuation functions Fq(s) de-
pend on the time scale s for diﬀerent values of q. Hence,
we must repeat steps 2, 3 and 4 for several time scales
s. It is apparent that Fq(s) will increase with increasing
s. Of course, Fq(s) depends on the DFA order m. By
construction, Fq(s) is only deﬁned for s ≥ m + 2.
• Step 5: Determine the scaling behavior of the ﬂuctua-
tion functions by analyzing log-log plots of Fq(s) versus s
for each value of q. If the series xi are long-range power-
law correlated, Fq(s) increases, for large values of s, as a
power-law,

In general, the exponent h(q) may depend on q. For
stationary time series such as fGn (fractional Gaussian
noise), Y (i) in Eq. 1, will be a fBm (fractional Brownian
motion) signal, so, 0 < h(q = 2) < 1.0 (see the appendix
for more details). The exponent h(2) is identical to the
well-known Hurst exponent H [28,29,44]. Also for a non-
stationary signal, such as fBm noise, Y (i) in Eq. 1, will
be a sum of fBm signal, so the corresponding scaling ex-
ponent of Fq(s) is identiﬁed by h(q = 2) > 1.0 [28,52]. In
this case the relation between the exponents h(2) and H
will be H = h(q = 2) − 1 (see appendix of [23]). The ex-
ponent h(q) is known as generalized Hurst exponent. The
auto-correlation function can be characterized by a power
law C(s) ≡ hnknk+si ∼ s−γ with exponent γ = 2 − 2H.
Its power spectra can be characterized by S(ω) ∼ ω−β
with frequency ω and β = 2H − 1, In the nonstationary
case, correlation exponent and power spectrum scaling
are γ = −2H and β = 2H + 1, respectively [28,52].

For monofractal time series, h(q) is independent of q,
since the scaling behavior of the variances F 2(s, ν) is
identical for all segments ν, and the averaging procedure
in Eq. (4) will just give this identical scaling behavior
for all values of q.
If we consider positive values of q,
the segments ν with large variance F 2(s, ν) (i. e.
large
deviations from the corresponding ﬁt) will dominate the
average Fq(s). Thus, for positive values of q, h(q) de-
scribes the scaling behavior of the segments with large
ﬂuctuations. For negative values of q, the segments ν
with small variance F 2(s, ν) will dominate the average
Fq(s). Hence, for negative values of q, h(q) describes the
scaling behavior of the segments with small ﬂuctuations
[53].

shown below. Suppose that the series xk of length N is
a stationary, normalized sequence. Then the detrending
procedure in step 3 of the MF-DFA method is not re-
quired, since no trend has to be eliminated. Thus, the
DFA can be replaced by the standard Fluctuation Anal-
ysis (FA), which is identical to the DFA except for a
simpliﬁed deﬁnition of the variance for each segment ν,
ν = 1, . . . , Ns. Step 3 now becomes [see Eq. (2)]:

F 2
FA(s, ν) ≡ [Y (νs) − Y ((ν − 1)s)]2.

Inserting this simpliﬁed deﬁnition into Eq. (4) and using
Eq. (5), we obtain

For simplicity we can assume that the length N of the
series is an integer multiple of the scale s, obtaining Ns =
N/s and therefore

|Y (νs) − Y ((ν − 1)s)|q ∼ sqh(q)−1.

(8)

This corresponds to the multifractal formalism used e. g.
in [45,47].
In fact, a hierarchy of exponents Hq simi-
lar to our h(q) has been introduced based on Eq. (8) in
[45].
In order to relate also to the standard textbook
box counting formalism [44,46], we employ the deﬁni-
tion of the proﬁle in Eq. (1). It is evident that the term
Y (νs) − Y ((ν − 1)s) in Eq. (8) is identical to the sum
of the numbers xk within each segment ν of size s. This
sum is known as the box probability ps(ν) in the standard
multifractal formalism for normalized series xk,

ps(ν) ≡

xk = Y (νs) − Y ((ν − 1)s).

The scaling exponent τ (q) is usually deﬁned via the par-
tition function Zq(s),

Zq(s) ≡

|ps(ν)|q ∼ sτ (q),

(10)

where q is a real parameter as in the MF-DFA method,
discussed above. Using Eq. (9) we see that Eq. (10) is
identical to Eq. (8), and obtain analytically the relation
between the two sets of multifractal scaling exponents,

1. Relation to standard multifractal analysis

τ (q) = qh(q) − 1.

(11)

For a stationary, normalized series the multifractal
scaling exponents h(q) deﬁned in Eq. (5) are directly re-
lated to the scaling exponents τ (q) deﬁned by the stan-
dard partition function-based multifractal formalism as

Thus, we observe that h(q) deﬁned in Eq. (5) for the
MF-DFA is directly related to the classical multifractal
scaling exponents τ (q). Note that h(q) is diﬀerent from
the generalized multifractal dimensions

D(q) ≡

of equal lengths s. Then the standard deviation is calcu-
lated within each interval using the following relation

α = h(q) + qh′(q) and f (α) = q[α − h(q)] + 1. (14)

III. ANALYSIS OF DATA

that are used instead of τ (q) in some papers. While h(q)
is independent of q for a monofractal time series, D(q)
depends on q in this case. Another way to characterize a
multifractal series is the singularity spectrum f (α), that
is related to τ (q) via a Legendre transform [44,46],

α = τ ′(q)

and f (α) = qα − τ (q).

(13)

Here, α is the singularity strength or H¨older exponent,
while f (α) denotes the dimension of the subset of the
series that is characterized by α. Using Eq. (11), we can
directly relate α and f (α) to h(q),

A H¨older exponent denotes monofractality, while in
the multifractal case, the diﬀerent parts of the structure
are characterized by diﬀerent values of α, leading to the
existence of the spectrum f (α).

C. Fourier-Detrended Fluctuation Analysis

In some cases, there exist one or more crossover (time)
scales s× separating regimes with diﬀerent scaling expo-
nents [22,30]. In this case investigation of the scaling be-
havior is more complicate and diﬀerent scaling exponents
are required for diﬀerent parts of the series [31]. There-
fore one needs a multitude of scaling exponents (multi-
fractality) for a full description of the scaling behavior.
A crossover usually can arise from a change in the corre-
lation properties of the signal at diﬀerent time or space
scales, or can often arise from trends in the data. To
remove the crossover due to a trend such as sinusoidal
trends, Fourier-Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (F-DFA)
is applied. The F-DFA is a modiﬁed approach for the
analysis of low frequency trends added to a noise in time
series [26,27,54,55].

In order to investigate how we can remove trends hav-
ing a low frequency periodic behavior, we transform data
record to Fourier space, then we truncate the ﬁrst few
coeﬃcient of the Fourier expansion and inverse Fourier
transform the series. After removing the sinusoidal
trends we can obtain the ﬂuctuation exponent by using
the direct calculation of the MF-DFA. If truncation num-
bers are suﬃcient, The crossover due to a sinusoidal trend
in the log-log plot of Fq(s) versus s disappears.

D. Scaled Windowed Variance Analysis

The Scaled Windowed Variance analysis was developed
by Cannon et al. (1997) [52]. The proﬁle of data, Y (i),
is divided into Ns ≡ int(N/s) non-overlapping segments

SWV(s) =

[Y (i) − hY (s)i]2

.

The average standard deviation of all windows of length
s is computed. This computation is repeated over all
possible interval lengths. The scaled windowed variance
is related to s by a power law

SWV ∼ sH .

(16)

As mentioned in section II, a spurious of correlations
may be detected if time series is nonstationarity, so di-
rect calculation of correlation behavior, spectral density
exponent, fractal dimensions etc., don’t give the reliable
results. It can be checked that the runoﬀ for Daugava
river is or not nonstationary. One can veriﬁed the non-
stationarity property experimentally by measuring the
stability of the average and variance in a moving window
for example with scale s. Figure 2 shows the standard
deviation of Daugava ﬂow signal versus scale s, is satu-
rated. Let us determine that whether the data set has
a sinusoidal trend or not. According to the MF-DFA1
method, Generalized Hurst exponents h(q) in Eq. (5) can
be found by analyzing log-log plots of Fq(s) versus s for
each q. Our investigation shows that there are at least
two crossover time scales s× in the log-log plots of Fq(s)
versus s for every q’s. These two crossovers divide Fq(s)
into three regions, as shown in Figure 3 ( for instance
we took q = 2). The existence of these regions is due
to the competition between noise and sinusoidal trend
[22]. For s < s1×, the noise has the dominating eﬀect
. For s1× < s < s2× the sinusoidal (such as seasonal)
trend dominates [22]. The values of s1× and s2× are ap-
proximately equal to 12 and 130 months, respectively.
The ﬁrst crossover is clearly related to seasonal trend
and the second ones is approximately equal to the well
known cycle of sun activity. This shows that in addi-
tion of seasonal eﬀect on the river ﬂow, the sun activity
strictly aﬀects on the feature and fractal properties of
river ﬂow ﬂuctuations. As shown in Figure 3, by com-
paring curves from some rivers and Sunspot we can see a
certain symmetry in the form of curves. Points of inﬂec-
tion are placed closely, but angle of bendings are opposite
(e.g. for Daugava river). This symmetry indicates a con-
nection between the activity of sun and ﬂow of water in
the rivers. In both cases sinusoidal tendency have been
found in the average part of the curves. Apparently the
sun activity governs the rivers.

As mentioned before, for very small scales s < s1× the
eﬀect of the sinusoidal trend is not pronounced, indicat-
ing that in this scale region the signal can be considered
as noise ﬂuctuating around a constant which is ﬁltered
out by the MF-DFA1 procedure. In this region the gen-
eralized DFA1 exponent for used rivers in this paper are
listed in Figure 4 , where conﬁrms that the process is a
stationary process with long-range correlation behavior.
To cancel the sinusoidal trend in MF-DFA1, we apply
F-DFA method on the present data. We truncate some of
the ﬁrst coeﬃcients of the Fourier expansion of the river
ﬂow ﬂuctuations. According to Figure 5, for eliminating
the crossover scales, we need to remove approximately
the ﬁrst 200 terms of the Fourier expansion. Then, by
inverse Fourier Transformation, the noise without sinu-
soidal trend is extracted (see Figure 5) [26,27,54,55].

The MF-DFA1 results of the remanning new signal just
for Daugava river are shown in Figure 6. The duct water
of Daugava river series is a multifractal process as indi-
cated by the strong q dependence of generalized Hurst ex-
ponents and τ (q) [56]. The q- dependence of the classical
multifractal scaling exponent τ (q) has diﬀerent behaviors
for q < 0 and q > 0. For positive and negative values of
q, the slopes of τ (q) are 0.45 ± 0.02 and 1.17 ± 0.02, re-
spectively. According to the value of Hurst exponent,
H = 0.52 ± 0.01, we ﬁnd that this series has approxi-
mately random behavior. This result is equal to value of
Hurst exponent in small scale of MF-DFA1 of noise with
sinusoidal trend. The values of derived quantities from
MF-DFA1 method, are given in Table I. Using the SWV
we also analysis the truncated series, Our result shows
that the value of Hurst exponent is H = 0.50 ± 0.01,
which is in agreement with the previous result.

by modiﬁed MF-DFA1 in comparison to MF-DFA1 for
original data is approximately 3.84%. Now the value of
Hurst exponent ensure us that the runoﬀ ﬂuctuations are
long-range correlation, so by ignoring the seasonal trend,
these processes have almost memory. This means that
the status of runoﬀ water statistically has long memory.

IV. COMPARISON OF THE MULTIFRACTALITY
FOR ORIGINAL, SHUFFLED AND SURROGATE
SERIES

As discussed in the section III the remanning data set
after the elimination of sinusoidal trend has the multi-
fractal nature.
In this section we are interested in to
determine the source of multifractality. In general, two
diﬀerent types of multifractality in time series can be dis-
tinguished: (i) Multifractality due to a fatness of proba-
bility density function (PDF) of the time series. In this
case the multifractality cannot be removed by shuﬄing
(ii) Multifractality due to diﬀerent correla-
the series.

tions in small and large scale ﬂuctuations. In this case
the data may have a PDF with ﬁnite moments, e. g.
a Gaussian distribution. Thus the corresponding shuf-
ﬂed time series will exhibit mono-fractal scaling, since
all long-range correlations are destroyed by the shuﬄing
procedure. If both kinds of multifractality are present,
the shuﬄed series will show weaker multifractality than
the original series. The easiest way to clarify the type of
multifractality, is by analyzing the corresponding shuf-
ﬂed and surrogate time series. The shuﬄing of time se-
ries destroys the long range correlation, Therefore if the
multifractality only belongs to the long range correlation,
we should ﬁnd hshuf (q) = 0.5. The multifractality nature
due to the fatness of the PDF signals is not aﬀected by the
shuﬄing procedure. On the other hand, to determine the
multifractality due to the broadness of PDF, the phase of
discrete fourier transform (DFT) coeﬃcients of the duct
water of Daugava river time series are replaced with a
set of pseudo independent distributed uniform (−π, π)
quantities in the surrogate method. The correlations in
the surrogate series do not change, but the probability
function changes to the Gaussian distribution. If multi-
fractality in the time series is due to a broad PDF, h(q)
obtained by the surrogate method will be independent
of q. If both kinds of multifractality are present in the
duct water of Daugava river time series, the shuﬄed and
surrogate series will show weaker multifractality than the
original one.

To check the nature of multifractality, we compare the
ﬂuctuation function Fq(s), for the original series ( af-
ter cancelation of sinusoidal trend) with the result of
the corresponding shuﬄed, F shuf
(s) and surrogate series
q
F sur
(s). Diﬀerences between these two ﬂuctuation func-
q
tions with the original one, directly indicate the presence
of long range correlations or broadness of probability den-
sity function in the original series. These diﬀerences can
be observed in a plot of the ratio Fq(s)/F shuf
(s) and
Fq(s)/F sur
(s) versus s [56]. Since the anomalous scal-
ing due to a broad probability density aﬀects Fq(s) and
F shuf
(s) in the same way, only multifractality due to cor-
q
relations will be observed in Fq(s)/F shuf
(s). The scaling
behavior of these ratios are

If only fatness of the PDF is responsible for the multifrac-
tality, one should ﬁnd h(q) = hshuf (q) and hcor(q) = 0.
On the other hand, deviations from hcor(q) = 0 indicates
the presence of correlations, and q dependence of hcor(q)
indicates that multifractality is due to the long rage cor-

hsur(q) will depend on q. The q dependence of the expo-
nent h(q) for original, surrogate and shuﬄed time series
are shown in Figure 7. The MF-DFA1 results of the sur-
rogate and shuﬄed signal are shown in Figures 8 and 9,
respectively. The q dependence of hcor and hPDF shows
that the multifractality nature of the duct water of Dau-
gava river time series is due to both broadness of the PDF
and long range correlation. The absolute value of hcor(q)
is greater than hPDF(q), so the multifractality due to the
fatness is weaker than the multifractality due to the cor-
relation. The deviation of hsur(q) and hshuf (q) from h(q)
can be determined by using χ2 test as follows:

χ2

i=1

(20)

the symbol ” ⋄ ” can be replaced by ”sur” and ”shuf”,
to determine the conﬁdence level of hsur and hshuf to
generalized Hurst exponents of original series, respec-
tively. The value of reduced chi-square χ2
N (N
is the number of degree of freedom) for shuﬄed and sur-
rogate time series are 2.57, 18.23, respectively. On the
other hand the width of singularity spectrum, f (α), i.e.
∆α = α(qmin) − α(qmax) for original, surrogate and shuf-
ﬂed time series are approximately, 0.843, 0.251 and 1.053
respectively. These values also show that the multifrac-
tality due to the broadness of the probability density
function is dominant [57].

V. CONCLUSION

The MF-DFA method allows us to determine the mul-
tifractal characterization of the nonstationary and sta-
tionary time series. We apply the recent method to in-
vestigate the existence of crossover on the result of MF-
DFA of river ﬂow ﬂuctuations. The concept of MF-DFA
of runoﬀ water of rivers can be used to gain deeper insight
in to the processes occurring in climate and hydrological
systems. We have shown that the MF-DFA1 result of the
monthly river ﬂows (e.g. duct water of Daugava river se-
ries) has two crossover time scale (s×). Our results show
that there exists a tendency between some runoﬀ river
and sun activity. Indeed due to the presence of both sea-
sonal trend and the eﬀect of sun’s period on some river

ﬂows, we see at least two crossover in the DFA result of
rivers, nevertheless, it is not expected that the number
of sunspots has superior eﬀect on runoﬀ water ﬂuctua-
tions. So this eﬀect has diﬀerent intensity on the rivers.
These crossover time scale are due to the sinusoidal trend.
To minimizing the eﬀect of this trend, we have applied
F-DFA on the river ﬂow time series. Applying the MF-
DFA1 method on truncated data, demonstrated that the
monthly duct water of Daugava river series is a station-
ary time series with approximately random behavior. For
other rivers we found long-range correlation in their sta-
tistical behaviors. The q dependence of h(q) and τ (q),
indicated that the monthly duct water of Daugava river
series has multifractal behavior. By comparing the gener-
alized Hurst exponent of the original time series with the
shuﬄed and surrogate one’s, we have found that multi-
fractality due to the broadness of the probability density
function has more contribution than the correlation. The
value of the Hurst exponent shows that the ﬂow of water
without seasonal trend is the same as random process.

VI. APPENDIX

In this appendix we derive the relation between the
exponent h(2) (DFA1 exponent) and Hurst exponent of
a fGn signal in one dimension. We show that for such
stationary signal the average sample variance (Eq. 4) for
q = 2, is proportional to sh(q), where h(q = 2) = H. It is
shown that the averaged sample variance F 2(s) behaves
as:

In the DFA1, the ﬁtting function will have the expres-
sion (yν (i) = aν + bνi). The slope bν and intercept aν of
a least-squares line Y (i) for every windows (ν) are given
by:

Finally using the Eqs. 24 and 29, it can be easily shown

that the Eq. 25 can be written as follows:

(30)

To determine the CH, we have to calculate some terms

where F 2(s; ν) is deﬁned as:

F 2(s; ν) =

[Yν (i) − yν(i)]2 ,

(22)

and CH is a function of Hurst exponent H. To prove
the statement we note that the data x(k) is a fractional

be a fBm signal:

Fq(s) with q < 0 will be smaller than Fq(s) with q > 0,
while both become equal for s = N . Hence, if we as-
sume an homogeneous scaling behavior of Fq(s) follow-
ing Eq. (5), the slope h(q) in a log-log plot of Fq(s) with
q < 0 versus s must be larger than the corresponding
slope for Fq(s) with q > 0. Thus, h(q) for q < 0 will
usually be larger than h(q) for q > 0.

[53] For the maximum scale s = N the ﬂuctuation function
Fq(s) is independent of q, since the sum in Eq. (4) runs
over only two identical segments (Ns ≡ [N/s] = 1). For
smaller scales s ≪ N the averaging procedure runs over
several segments, and the average value Fq(s) will be
dominated by the F 2(s, ν) from the segments with small
(large) ﬂuctuations if q < 0 (q > 0). Thus, for s ≪ N ,

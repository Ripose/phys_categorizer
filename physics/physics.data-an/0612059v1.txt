Abstract

We propose a route for the evaluation of risk based on a transformation of the covariance matrix.

The approach uses a ‘potential’ or ‘objective’ function. This allows us to rescale data from diferent

assets (or sources) such that each set then has similar statistical properties in terms of their

probability distributions. The method is tested using historical data from both the New York and

Warsaw Stock Exchanges.

INTRODUCTION

Optimization of portfolios has been much studied since the pioneering work of Markowitz

[1, 2] on the mean-variance portfolio optimization [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,

14, 15, 16]. However the basic construction of the portfolio has not changed much as a

result. Computation of Sharp ratios [17, 18] and the Markowitz analysis equate risk with

the co-variance matrix. Portfolio allocations are then computed by maximizing a suitable

constructed utility function [19, 20, 21]. Moreover, the approach taken by Markowitz and

many other authors [1, 2] is essentially only appropriate for random walks and Gaussian

distributions [3, 4, 5]. Many economists have sought to use other utility functions and invoke

additional objectives [22, 23] in which portfolio weights are computed via maximization

of these diﬀerent utility functionals. Others have introduced additional features of the

probability distribution such as the third moment or skewness of the returns [22, 23]. This

builds in aspects of the deviation of the probability distribution from the Gaussian as well

as the asymmetry.

Introducing even a constant value for the skewness may yield more

reliable portfolio weights than a calculation in which only the variance or second moment

of the distribution is used and where the risk of extreme values is seriously underestimated.

Similar comments could be made about the introduction of the kurtosis which is a ﬁrst order

route to addressing the issue of ‘fat’ tails.

An important outcome is the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) [10, 24, 25, 26] where

risk relates to correlations within the market portfolio [10, 24, 25, 26] although the risk now

is clearly that all investments will collapse simultaneously. Furthermore it is assumed that

risk that achieves premiums in the long term should not be reducible otherwise arbitrage is

possible [25]. This is essentially the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT).

However, key issues remain unresolved. For example, one weakness of CAPM and APT

theories is that they assume eﬃciency in the proliferation of market information. In a real

market not all investors have the same or complete information and arbitrage is possible.

Merton [27] has discussed this and in so doing has extended CAPM theory to deal more

eﬀectively with small ﬁrms for which information is not always readily available.

Here we concern ourselves with a new approach to the exploitation of datasets for the

computation of portfolio weights within a diversiﬁed portfolio. The method exploits the

full character of the distribution function each asset in the portfolio and seeks to maximize

2

the impact of correlations. In the next section we discuss the background to our approach

and introduce the so-called objective function. Having established this we show how, from

data, we can construct values for a renormalized objective function. These are then used in

section III to obtain covariance matrices and weights for portfolios of stocks. The calculations

are illustrated in section IV by examples from both the US and Warsaw stock exchanges. We

also show how the approach modiﬁes the underlying distribution of eigenvalues enhancing

the correlations for larger values.

II. OBJECTIVE FUNCTION

Consider an asset, characterized by a price, S(t) and return x(t) = ln S(t + 1)/S(t).

The objective function, w(x) is deﬁned in terms of the stationary probability distribution

for returns, P (x), viz:

P (x) =

e−w(x)/D,

1
Z

where Z is a normalization factor. Such functions are familiar to physicists and may be

derived by minimizing a ‘free energy’ functional, F (w(x)), subject to constraints on the

mean value of the objective function, viz:

F =

dxP (x)[ln P (x) + w(x)/D − λ]

Z
R

Such a form for the probability distribution is also the outcome of a model that assumes

returns are governed by a generalised Markovian stochastic process of the form

The Gaussian processes, ε, satisfy:

x(t + 1) − x(t) = f (x) + g(x)ε(t)

hε(t)ε(t′)i = Dδ(t − t′)

hε(t)i = 0

For the moment we leave the form of the functions f and g unspeciﬁed except to say that they

only depend on x(t). The solution to such a stochastic process has been deduced elsewhere

[28, 29, 30]. Adopting the Ito convention, the distribution function, P (x, t), associated with

the process is given by the Fokker Planck equation:

Z is again a normalization factor.

A number of diﬀerent cases are evident are expressed in the table I. Row four is obtained

from row three by introducing (ν + 1) /2 = 2D − λ and choosing g(x) = 1 + x2/ν when we

see that the distribution function reduces to a student distribution. Clearly ν > 1 otherwise

we cannot normalize the distribution function. In developing our methodology in the next

sections we shall focus on the use of the student distribution that seems to oﬀer good ﬁts

to the data we consider. Tsallis and Anteneodo [31] have shown how similar multiplicative

stochastic processes based on other non-analytic choices for the function f and g can lead

to q-exponentials.

III. PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION

As we have noted above it is usual for a portfolio of M stocks to compute portfolio weights,

pi using the covariance matrix, C and deﬁning the risk, R, as:

Optimizing this in the absence of risk free assets yields the weight of stock i:

where Z is a normalization factor.

From our previous discussion, it should be clear that the magnitude of the correlations

calculated in this way depend on the relative ‘objective values for pairs of stocks, i and

j. Transforming the objective value will change the magnitude of this correlation. We

now assert following the discussion in the previous section that the maximum correlation is

obtained by renormalizing the objective values such that the total set of values, xi(tj) for all i

from 1 to M and j from 1 to M are drawn from a common distribution. To eﬀect this change,

we ﬁrst compute for each asset the probability distribution by ﬁtting the data for each asset

using a student distribution characterised by the power law index. We then compute for

each value of the return xi(tj) the corresponding objective value, wi(xtj ). These objective

values are then transformed to yield a set of renornalised objective values as follows:

¯wi(xtj ) =

wi(xtj )
N

Xi,j

Pi

Having computed these renormalized objective values we can now obtain the corresponding

set of values for xi(t) by inverting the values according to a new student distribution that

characterises the entire data set consisting of MxN values. Hence using the result in row 4

of table 1:

(10)
Thus we can now compute for our portfolio of M stocks a new covariance matrix, ˜C using

ν(1 − e2w/(ν+1))

x = ±

q

these renormalized values of x . This yields a new minimized value for the risk:

˜R =

˜Ci,j ˜pi ˜pj

ILLUSTRATIVE RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS

We show in Figures 1 and 2 the outcome of implementing the method for a simple portfolio

of 2 stocks (i.e, M = 2). Speciﬁcally we used data for NYSE stocks General Electric and

Boeing. For each stock we used 12500 data points extending over the time period January

1999 to December 2000. Student distributions are ﬁtted separately to the positive and

negative returns. It can be seen that the student distributions for each stock are diﬀerent

prior to renormalization but are the same after renormalization. The overall changes as a

result of our renormalization process are small but we shall see below that they can lead to

changes in the distribution of eigenvalues for large eigenvalues.

We followed up this computation by renormalizing data for two diﬀerent groups of stocks.

First we selected 60 stocks from the NYSE as before over the period January 1999 to

December 2000 and implemented the prescription over a moving 75 day window using 1500

points for each window. In this way we could compute the various elements of the correlation

matrix and the associated optimum weights for the diﬀerent stocks in the portfolio as a

function of time. The results are shown in Figure 3. Figure 4 gives the results of a similar

set of calculation for a portfolio of 33 stocks from the Warsaw stock exchanges over the period

May 2001 to February 2006. In order to prevent situations arising where all the money is

invested in just one stock we have, in our calculations, imposed the limit |pi| < 0.15.

Although we have not included transaction costs, in both cases it seems that using data

based on our renormalization procedure is a better route to greater overall returns.

Additional insight into the procedure is provided when we compare the distribution of

eigenvalues for the standard covariance matrix with the corresponding distribution for the

renormalized covariance matrix. These are shown in Figure 5.

It can be seen that the

transformation procedure enhances correlations as anticipated and this enhancement occurs

We are currently examining other opportunities to stock assessment oﬀered by the ap-

at larger eigenvalues.

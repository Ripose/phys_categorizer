Abstract. This paper shows in detail the application of a new stochastic approach for the characterization
of surface height proﬁles, which is based on the theory of Markov processes. With this analysis we achieve
a characterization of the scale dependent complexity of surface roughness by means of a Fokker-Planck
or Langevin equation, providing the complete stochastic information of multiscale joint probabilities. The
method is applied to several surfaces with diﬀerent properties, for the purpose of showing the utility of
this method in more details. In particular we show the evidence of Markov properties, and we estimate
the parameters of the Fokker-Planck equation by pure, parameter-free data analysis. The resulting Fokker-
Planck equations are veriﬁed by numerical reconstruction of conditional probability density functions.
The results are compared with those from the analysis of multi-aﬃne and extended multi-aﬃne scaling
properties which is often used for surface topographies. The diﬀerent surface structures analysed here show
in details advantages and disadvantages of these methods.

1 Introduction

Among the great variety of complex and disordered sys-
tems the complexity of surface roughness is especially at-
tracting scientiﬁc interest [1–5]. Physical and chemical
properties of surfaces and interfaces are to a signiﬁcant
degree determined by their topographic structure. Thus a
comprehensive characterization of their topography is of
vital interest from a scientiﬁc point of view as well as for
many applications [6–8].

Most popular methods used today for the character-
ization of surface roughness are based on the concepts
of self-aﬃnity and multi-aﬃnity, where the multifractal
f (α) spectrum has been regarded as the most complete
characterization of a surface [2, 3, 9, 10]. One example for
a measure of roughness which is commonly used in this

context is the rms surface width wr(x) =

where h(˜x) is the measured height at point ˜x,

notes the average over an interval of length r around the
selected point x, and ¯h the mean value of h(˜x) in that
interval. Thus the roughness is measured at a speciﬁc lo-
cation x and over a speciﬁc scale r. Then a scaling regime
in r, if existent, is analyzed

thorough introduction into scaling concepts we refer the
reader to the literature, e.g. [2, 3, 9, 10]. Terms concerning
scaling concepts which are used in this paper are shortly
introduced in section 4. Here, we have to note the follow-
ing points which concern stochastic aspects of roughness
analysis: First, the ensemble average
must obey a
scaling law as mentioned above, and second, the statis-
tics of wr(x) are investigated on distinct length scales r,
thus possible correlations between wr(x) and wr′(x) on
diﬀerent scales r, r′ are not examined.

In this paper we want to give a deeper introduction
into a new approach to surface roughness analysis which
has recently been introduced by us [11, 12] and by [13].
This method is based on stochastic processes which should
grasp the scale dependency of surface roughness in a most
general way. No scaling feature is explicitly required, and
especially the correlations between diﬀerent scales r and r′
are investigated. To this end we present a systematic pro-
cedure how the explicit form of a stochastic process for the
r-evolution of a roughness measure similar to wr(x) can be
extracted directly from the measured surface topography.
This stochastic approach has turned out to be a promising
tool also for other systems with scale dependent complex-
ity like turbulence [11, 14, 15], ﬁnancial data [16, 17], and
cosmic background radiation [18]. It has been also this
stochastic approach which has enabled recently the nu-
merical reconstruction of surface topographies [13].

M. Waechter et al.: Stochastic analysis of diﬀerent rough surfaces

Here we demonstrate our ansatz by analysing a num-
ber of data sets from diﬀerent surfaces. The purpose is
to show extensively the utility of this method for a wide
class of rough surfaces. The examples show diﬀerent kinds
of scaling properties which are additionally brieﬂy anal-
ysed. Among these examples is a collection of road sur-
faces measured with a specially designed proﬁle scanner.
First results of the analysis of one of these surfaces have
already been presented [12]. AFM measurement data from
an evaporated gold ﬁlm have already been analysed in an
earlier stage of the method [11]. Since then, the method
could be signiﬁcantly reﬁned and extended. Measurements
of a steel crack surface were taken by confocal laser scan-
ning microscopy (CLSM) [5].

As a measure of surface roughness we use the height

increment [19]

hr(x) := h(x + r/2)

h(x

r/2)

depending on the length scale r. For other scale depen-
dent roughness measures, see [3,10]. The height increment
hr is used because its moments, which are well-known as
structure functions (see section 4), are closely connected
with spatial correlation functions. Nevertheless, it should
be pointed out that our method presented in the follow-
ing could be easily generalized to any scale dependent
measure, e.g. the above-mentioned wr(x) or wavelet func-
tions [20]. As a new ansatz, hr is regarded as a stochastic
variable in r. Without loss of generality we consider the
process as being directed from larger to smaller scales.
The focus of our method is the investigation how surface
roughness is linked between diﬀerent length scales.

In the remainder of this paper we will ﬁrst summarize
in section 2 some central aspects of the theory of Markov
processes which form the basis of our analysis procedure.
Details concerning the measurement data are presented
in section 3, their scaling properties are analyzed in sec-
tion 4. Markov properties of our examples are investigated
in section 5. In section 6 we estimate for each data set the
parameters of a Fokker-Planck equation. The ability of
this equation to describe the statistics of hr in the scale
variable r is then examined in section 7, followed by con-
cluding remarks in section 8.

2 Surface roughness as a Markov process

Complete information about the stochastic process would
be available by the knowledge of all possible n-point, or
more precisely n-scale, joint probability density functions
(pdf) p(h1, r1; h2, r2; . . . ; hn, rn) describing the probability
of ﬁnding simultaneously the increments h1 on the scale
r1, h2 on the scale r2, and so forth up to hn on the scale
rn. Here we use the notation hi(x) = hri(x), see eq. (1).
Without loss of generality we take r1 < r2 < . . . < rn.
As a ﬁrst question one has to ask for a suitable simpliﬁ-
cation. In any case the n-scale joint pdf can be expressed
by multiconditional pdf

p(h1, r1; . . . ; hn, rn) =

h3, r3; . . . ; hn, rn)

ﬁnding the increment hi on the scale ri under the condi-
tion that simultaneously, i.e. at the same location x, on a
larger scale rj the value hj was found. It is deﬁned with
the help of the joint probability p(hi, ri; hj, rj ) by

An important simpliﬁcation arises if

hi+1, ri+1; . . . ; hn, rn) = p(hi, ri|

p(hi, ri|
This property is the deﬁning feature of a Markov process
evolving from ri+1 to ri. Thus for a Markov process the
n-scale joint pdf factorize into n conditional pdf

The Markov property implies that the r-dependence of
hr can be regarded as a stochastic process evolving in r,
driven by deterministic and random forces. Here it should
be noted that if condition (4) holds this is true for a pro-
cess evolving in r from large down to small scales as well
as reversely from small to large scales [21]. Equation (5)
also emphasizes the fundamental meaning of conditional
probabilities for Markov processes since they determine
any n-scale joint pdf and thus the complete statistics of
the process.

For any Markov process a Kramers-Moyal expansion of
the governing master equation exists [22]. For our height
proﬁles it takes the form

The minus sign on the left side of eq. (6) expresses the
direction of the process from larger to smaller scales, fur-
thermore the factor r corresponds to a logarithmic vari-
able ρ = ln r which leads to simpliﬁed results in the case of
scaling behaviour [23]. To derive the Kramers-Moyal co-
eﬃcients D(k)(hr, r), the limit ∆r
0 of the conditional
moments has to be performed:

3 Measurement data

A second major simpliﬁcation is valid if the noise in-
cluded in the process is Gaussian distributed. In this case
the coeﬃcient D(4) vanishes (from eqs. (7) and (8) it
can be seen that D(4) is a measure of non-gaussianity of
the included noise). According to Pawula’s theorem, to-
gether with D(4) all the D(k) with k
3 disappear and
the Kramers-Moyal expansion (6) collapses to a Fokker-
Planck equation [22], also known as Kolmogorov equa-
tion [24]:

The Fokker-Planck equation then describes the evolution
of the conditional probability density function from larger
to smaller length scales and thus also the complete n-scale
statistics. The term D(1)(hr, r) is commonly denoted as
drift term, describing the deterministic part of the pro-
cess, while D(2)(hr, r) is designated as diﬀusion term, de-
termined by the variance of a Gaussian, δ-correlated noise
(compare also eqs. (7) and (8)).

By integrating over h0 it can be seen that the Fokker-
Planck equation (9) is also valid for the unconditional
probabilities p(hr, r) (see also section 7). Thus it covers
(also called struc-
also the behaviour of the moments
ture functions) including any possible scaling behaviour.
An equation for the moments can be obtained by addi-
tionally multiplying with hn

At last we want to point out that the Fokker-Planck
equation (9) corresponds to the following Langevin equa-
tion (we use Itˆo’s deﬁnition) [22]

where Γ (r) is a Gaussian distributed, δ-correlated noise.
The use of this Langevin model in the scale variable opens
the possibility to directly simulate surface proﬁles with
given stochastic properties, similar to [13].

With this brief summary of features of stochastic pro-
cesses we have ﬁxed the scheme after which we will present
our analysis of diverse rough surfaces. There are three
steps: First, the veriﬁcation of the Markov property. Sec-
ond, the estimation of drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients D(1)
and D(2). Third, veriﬁcation of the estimated coeﬃcients
by numerical solution of the according Fokker-Planck equa-
tion, thus reconstructing pdf which are compared to em-
pirical ones.

With the method outlined in section 2 we analysed a col-
lection of road surfaces measured with a specially designed
proﬁle scanner as well as two microscopic surfaces, namely
an evaporated gold ﬁlm and a crack surface of a low-
alloyed steel sample, as already mentioned in section 1.

The road surfaces have been measured with a specially
designed surface proﬁle scanner. Longitudinal resolution
was 1.04 mm, proﬁle length typically 20 m or 19000 sam-
ples, respectively. Between ten and twenty parallel pro-
ﬁles with a lateral distance of 10 mm were taken for each
surface, see ﬁg. 1. Vertical error was always smaller than
0.5 mm but in most cases approximately 0.1 mm. Details
can be found in [25].

For the Au ﬁlm data, the surface of four optical glass
plates had been coated with an Au layer of 60 nm thick-
ness by thermal evaporation [11]. The topography of these
ﬁlms was measured by atomic force microscopy in diﬀer-
ent resolutions, resulting in a set of images of 256
256
pixels each, where every pixel speciﬁes the surface height
relative to a reference plane, see ﬁg. 5. Out of those images
99 could be used for the analysis presented here, resulting
106 data points. Sidelengths vary between
in about 6.5
36 nm and 2.8 µm.

The sample of the crack measurements was a fracture
surface of a low-alloyed steel (german brand 10MnMoNi5-
5). A detailed description of the measurements can be
found in [5]. Three CLSM (Confocal Laser Scanning Mi-
croscopy) images of size 512x512 pixels in diﬀerent spa-
tial resolutions were available, see ﬁg. 9. Pixel sizes are
0.49, 0.98, and 1.95 µm, resulting in image widths of 251,
502, and 998 µm, repectively. Unavoidable artefacts of the
CLSM method were removed by simply omitting for each
image those data with the smallest and largest height
value, similar to [5]. Nevertheless this cannot guarantee
to detect all artefacts. Possible consequences are discussed
together with the results.

For analysis in the framework of the theory of Markov
processes, we will normalize the measurement data by the
quantity σ∞ deﬁned by

σ2
∞ = lim

r→∞h

h2
ri

.

(12)

r =

ri
h

Thus it is possible to obtain dimensionless data with a
normalization independent of the scale r, in contrast to
e.g. σ2
. As a consequence also the results, espe-
cially M (k)(hr, r, ∆r) and D(k)(hr, r) (cf. section 2), will
be dimensionless. From the deﬁnition it is easy to see that
∞ = 2σ2
σ∞ can be derived via σ2

becomes uncorrelated for large distances r.

4 Scaling analysis

For presentation in this paper a number of examples was
selected from all data sets under investigation. Because
most popular methods of surface analysis are based on
scaling features of some topographical measure, examples

4

were chosen with respect to their diﬀerent scaling proper-
ties as well as their results from our analysis based on the
theory of Markov processes.

In the analysis presented here we use the well-known
height increment hr(x), which has been deﬁned in eq. 1,
as a scale-dependent measure of the complexity of rough
surfaces [19]. Scaling properties are reﬂected by the r-
dependence of the so-called structure functions

If one then ﬁnds

(14)

for a range of r, this regime is called the scaling range. In
that range the investigated proﬁles have self-aﬃne proper-
ties, i.e., they are statistically invariant under an anisotropic
scale transformation. If furthermore the dependence of the
exponents ξn on the order n is nonlinear, one speaks of
multi-aﬃne scaling. Those properties are no longer iden-
tiﬁed by a single scaling exponent, but an inﬁnite set of
exponents. A detailed explanation of self- and multi-aﬃne
concepts is beyond the scope of this article. Instead, we
would like to refer the reader to the literature [2, 3, 9, 10].
The power spectrum, which often is used to determine
scaling properties, can easily be derived from the second
order structure function. It is deﬁned as the Fourier trans-
form of the autocorrelation function R(r), which itself is
closely related to S2(r) by R(r) =
S2(r)/2, com-
pare eqs. (1) and (13).

In addition to the r-dependence of the structure func-
tions, a generalized form of scaling behaviour can be deter-
mined analogously to the Extended Self Similarity (ESS)
method which is popular in turbulence research [26]. When
the Sn(r) are plotted against a structure function of spe-
ciﬁc order, say S3(r), in many cases an extended scaling
regime is found according to

ζn

Sn(r)

S3(r)

Clearly, meaningful results are restricted to the regime
where S3 is monotonous. It is easy to see that now the ξn
can be obtained by

(16)

cf. [26]. While for turbulence it is widely accepted that by
this means experimental deﬁencies can be compensated
to some degree, for surface roughness the meaning of ESS
lies merely in a generalized form of scaling properties.

It should be noted that results of any scaling analysis
may be inﬂuenced by the method of measurement, by the
deﬁnition of the roughness measure, here hr(x) (or wr(x)
as mentioned in section 1), as well as by the algorithms
used for the analysis [5, 27]. Nevertheless, this problem is
not addressed here as the main focus of our investigations
is the application of the theory of Markov processes to
experimental data.

4.1 Surfaces with scaling properties

In ﬁg. 1 we present road surface data with diﬀerent kinds
of scaling properties. For each data set a short proﬁle sec-
tion is shown. Structure functions of order one to six in
double logarithmic scale are presented in ﬁg. 2. Follow-
ing the arguments in [14], higher order structure func-
tions cannot be evaluated with suﬃcient precision from
the given amount of data points. The worn asphalt pave-
ment (Road 1) is an example for a comparably large scal-
ing regime over more than one order of magnitude in r. A
surface with similar features, namely a cobblestone road,
has already been presented in [12]. Two separate scaling
regions are found for a Y-shaped concrete stone pavement
(Road 2). Additionally a sharp notch can be seen in the
structure functions at r = 0.2 m, indicating a strong peri-
odicity of the pavement caused by the length of the indi-
vidual stones. The third example, a “pebbled concrete”
pavement (Road 3), consists of concrete stones with a
top layer of washed pebbles. This material is also known
as “exposed aggregate concrete”. Here, the scaling region
of the structure functions is only small. For the basalt
stone pavement (Road 4), being the fourth example, scal-
ing properties are poor. We have nevertheless marked a
possible scaling range and derived the respective scaling
exponents for comparison with the other examples. Simi-
lar to the Y-shaped concrete stones, a periodicity can be
found at about 0.1 m length scale.

Results for generalized scaling behaviour according to
eq. (15) are shown in ﬁg. 3. It can be seen that indeed
for three of the surfaces of ﬁg. 1 an improved scaling be-
haviour is found by this method. Only for Road 4 even
the generalized scaling properties remain weak. In ﬁg. 4
the scaling exponents ξn of the structure functions within
the marked scaling regimes in ﬁg. 2 were determined and
plotted against the order n as open symbols. Additionally,
values of ξn were derived according to eqs. (15) and (16)
and added as crosses. For Road 2 two sets of exponents
correspond to the two distinct scaling regimes in ﬁg. 2.
Even though there is only one set of ζn found in ﬁg. 3,
two sets of ξn are obtained due to the two diﬀerent ξ3, see
eqs. (14) and (16).

All surfaces from ﬁg. 1 show a more or less nonlinear
dependence of the ξn on n, indicating multi-aﬃne scal-
ing properties. The scaling exponents obtained via the
generalized scaling according to eq. (15) are in good cor-
respondence with the ξn achieved by the application of
eq. (14). Deviations are seen for Road 2 and at higher
orders for Road 3, possibly caused by inaccuracies in the
ﬁtting procedure. For Road 4 no generalized scaling is ob-
served (compare ﬁg. 3) and thus values of ξn cannot be
derived from ζn. From this we conclude that scaling prop-
erties for some cases are questionable as a comprehensive
tool to characterize the complexity of a rough surface.

An example for good scaling properties is the gold ﬁlm
surface (Au). To increase statistical accuracy, increments
are here evaluated in the direction of the rows of the im-
ages as well as the columns. In ﬁg. 5 two of the 99 images
under investigation are shown. Figure 6 presents the struc-
ture functions Sn(r), derived from all images. The surface

4.2 Surfaces without scaling properties

To complete the set of examples, we present two surfaces
without scaling properties. The ﬁrst one is a smooth as-
phalt road (Road 5), shown in ﬁg. 8. No power law can
be detected for the Sn(r) but a generalized scaling is ob-
served in ﬁg. 11(a). The range of values of S3, however, is
comparably small.

The second example lacking a scaling regime is the
steel fracture surface (Crack). One of the three CLSM im-
ages under investigation is shown in ﬁg. 9(a). Figure 9(b)

4.3 Conclusions on scaling analysis

To conclude the scaling analysis of our examples, we have
chosen surfaces with a range of diﬀerent scaling proper-
ties from good scaling in comparably wide ranges, such as
for Road 1 and Au, to the absence of scaling, such as for
Road 5 and Crack. The generalized scaling analysis anal-
ogously to ESS [26] leads to the same scaling exponents
as the dependence of the structure functions Sn(r) on the
scale r, with some minor deviations.

5 Markov properties

As outlined in sections 1 and 2, we want to describe the
evolution of height increments hr(x) in the scale variable
r as realizations of a Markov process with the help of a
Fokker-Planck equation. Consequently, the ﬁrst step in the
analysis procedure has to be the veriﬁcation of the Markov
properties of hr(x) as stochastic variable in r.

For a Markov process the deﬁning feature is that the
n-scale conditional probability distributions are equal to
the single conditional probabilities, according to eq. (4).
With the given amount of data points the veriﬁcation of
this condition is only possible for three diﬀerent scales.
Additionally the scales r are limited by the available pro-
ﬁle length. For the sake of simplicity we will always take
r1 = ∆r. Thus we can test the validity of
r2 = r2 −
r3 −
eq. (4) in the form

h2, r1+∆r) = p(h1, r1|

h2, r1+∆r; h3 = 0, r1+2∆r) .
p(h1, r1|
(17)
Note that in eq. (17) we take h3 = 0 to restrict the number
of free parameters in the pdf with double condition.

Three procedures were applied to ﬁnd out whether
Markov properties are given for our data. From the re-
sults of all three tests we will ﬁnd a minimal length scale
lM for which this is the case. The meaning of this so-called
Markov length will be discussed below. In the following we
will demonstrate the methods at the example of the Au
surface.

5.1 Testing procedures

±

h2=

h2, r2) and p(h1, r1|

The most straightforward way to verify eq. (17) is vi-
sual comparison of both sides, i.e., the pdf with single
and double conditions. This is illustrated in ﬁg. 12 for
two diﬀerent scale separations ∆r = 17 nm and 35 nm. In
each case a contour plot of single and double conditional
h2, r2; h3 =0, r3)
probabilities p(h1, r1|
is presented on top. Below two one-dimensional cuts at
σ∞ are shown, representing di-
ﬁxed values of h2 ≈ ±
σ∞, r2; h3=0, r3). It can be seen that
rectly p(h1, r1|
on panel (a), for the smaller value of ∆r, the single and
double conditional probability are diﬀerent. This becomes
clear from the crossing solid and broken contour lines of
the contour plot as well as from the diﬀering lines and
symbols of the one-dimensional plots below. Panel (b),
for ∆r = 35 nm, shows good correspondence of both con-
ditional pdf. We take this ﬁnding as a strong hint that for
this scale separation ∆r eq. (4) is valid and Markov prop-
erties are given. Following this procedure for all accessible
values of ∆r, the presence of Markov properties was ex-
amined. For this surface Markov properties were found for
scale distances from (25

5) nm upwards.

The validity of eq. (17) can also be be quantiﬁed math-
ematically using statistical tests. An approach via the
well-known χ2 measure has been presented in [28], whereas
in [14] the Wilcoxon test has been used. Next, we give a
brief introduction to this procedure, which will be used
here, too. More detailed discussions of this test can be
found in [14, 21, 29]. For this procedure, we introduce the
notation of two stochastic variables xi, i = 1, . . . , n and
yj, j = 1, . . . , m which represent the two samples from
which both conditional pdf of eq. (4) are estimated, i.e.

±

x(hr2 , r1, r2) = hr1 |hr2
y(hr2, hr3, r1, r2, r3) = hr1 |hr2 ;hr3 .

(18)

·|hx denotes the conditioning. All events of both sam-
Here
ples are sorted together in ascending order into one se-
quence, according to their value. Now the total number of
so called inversions is counted, where the number of in-
versions for a single event yj is just the number of events
of the other sample which have a smaller value xi < yj. If
25, the total number of inver-
eq. (17) holds and n, m

diﬀerent scale separations ∆r = 14 nm (a) and 35 nm (b),

169 nm. In each case a contour plot of conditional probabili-
ties p(h1, r1|h2, r2) (dashed lines) and p(h1, r1|h2, r2; h3=0, r3)
(solid lines) is shown on top. Contour levels diﬀer by a factor

Wilcoxon test is that all events xi, yj have to be statisti-
cally independent. This means that the intervals of sub-
sequent height increments hr have to be separated by the
largest scale involved. Thus the number of evaluable data
is dramatically reduced.

Another method to show the validity of condition (17)
is the investigation of the well-known necessary condi-

Kolmogorov equation [22]

(21)
We use this equation as a method to investigate the Markov
properties of our data. This procedure was used for exam-
ple in [13,30–32] for the veriﬁcation of Markov properties.
It also served to show for the ﬁrst time the existence of
a Markov length in [28]. The conditional probabilities in
eq. (21) are directly estimated from the measured proﬁles.
In ﬁg. 14 both sides of the Chapman-Kolmogorov equa-
tion are compared for two diﬀerent values of ∆r. In an
analogous way to ﬁg. 12, for each ∆r the two conditional
probabilities are presented together in a contour plot as
well as in two cuts at ﬁxed values of h2. While for the
smaller value ∆r = 14 nm both the contour lines and the
cuts at ﬁxed h2 clearly diﬀer, we ﬁnd good correspondence
for the larger value ∆r = 35 nm.

A third method which we did not use here but which
is reported in the literature is based on the description of
the stochastic process by a Langevin equation. With this
knowledge of the Langevin equation (11) the noise can be
reconstructed and analyzed with respect to its correlation
[33, 34].

5.2 Conclusions on Markov properties

Results of the methods described above were combined to
determine whether Markov properties of the height incre-
ment hr(x) in the scale variable are present for our sur-
face measurements. We found Markov properties for all
selected examples of surface measurement data. It is also
common to all examples that these Markov properties are
not universal to all scale separations ∆r but there exists

a lower threshold which we call the Markov length lM .
It was determined in each case by systematic application
of the three testing procedures for all accessible length
scales r and scale separations ∆r. The resulting values
are listed in table 1. This presence of Markov properties
only for values of ∆r above a certain threshold has also
been found for stochastic data generated by a large va-
riety of processes and especially occurs also in turbulent
velocities [11, 14, 18, 28, 35].

The meaning of this Markov length lM may be seen
in comparison with a mean free path length of a Brown-
ian motion. Only above this mean free path a stochastic
process description is valid. For smaller scales there must
be some coherence which prohibits to describe the struc-
ture by a Markov process. If for example the description
of a surface structure requires a second order derivative in
space, a Langevin equation description (11) becomes im-
possible. In this case a higher dimensional Langevin equa-
tion (at least two variables) is needed. It may be interest-
ing to note that the Markov length we found for the Au
surface of about 30 nm coincides quite well with the size
of the largest grain structures we see in ﬁg. 5. Thus the
Au surface may be thought of as a composition of grains
(coherent structures) by a stochastic Markov process.

In the case of Road 2 with its strong periodicity at
0.2 m the Markov properties end slightly above this length
scale. It seems evident that here the Markov property is
destroyed by the periodicity. While some of the other sur-
faces also have periodicities, these are never as sharp as
for Road 2. An upper limit for Markov properties could
not be found for any of the other surfaces.

Another interesting ﬁnding can be seen from ﬁgs. 2, 6,
8, and 10. There is no connection between scaling range
and the range where Markov properties hold. Regimes of
scaling and Markov properties are found to be distinct,
overlapping or covering, depending on the surface. Data
sets which fulﬁll the Markov property do not in all cases
show a scaling regime at all. Also, on the other hand, scal-
ing features seem not to imply Markov properties, which
has been indicated previously for some numerically gener-
ated data in [11]. While there is always an upper limit of
the scaling regime, we found only one surface the Markov
properties of which possess an upper bound.

6 Estimation of drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients

As a next step we want to concentrate on extracting the
concrete form of the stochastic process, if the Markov
properties are fulﬁlled. As mentioned in section 2 our anal-
ysis is based on the estimation of Kramers-Moyal coeﬃ-
cients. The procedure we use to obtain the drift (D(1)) and
diﬀusion coeﬃcient (D(2)) for Fokker-Planck equation (9)
was already outlined by Kolmogorov [24], see also [14,22].
First, the conditional moments M (k)(hr, r, ∆r) for ﬁnite
step sizes ∆r are estimated from the data via moments of
the conditional probabilities. This is done by application

of the deﬁnition in eq. (8), which is recalled here:

M (k)(hr, r, ∆r) =

+∞

r
k!∆r Z

(˜h

hr)k p(˜h, r

−∞

−

∆r

hr, r) d˜h
|

−

(22)
The conditional probabilities in the integral are obtained
by counting events in the measurement data as shown al-
ready in section 5. Here, one fundamental diﬃculty of the
method arises: For reliable estimates of conditional prob-
abilities we need a suﬃcient number of events even for
rare combinations of ˜h, hr. Consequently, a large amount
of data points is needed. This problem becomes even more
important if one takes into account that a large range in
r should be considered. The number of statistically inde-
pendent intervals hr is limited by the length of the given
data set and decreases with increasing r.

In a second step, the coeﬃcients D(k)(hr, r) are ob-
tained from the limit of M (k)(hr, r, ∆r) when ∆r approaches
zero (see deﬁnition in eq. (7)). For ﬁxed values of r and hr
a straight line is ﬁtted to the sequence of M (k)(hr, r, ∆r)
depending on ∆r and extrapolated against ∆r = 0. The
linear dependence results as the lowest order term when
the ∆r-dependence of M (k)(hr, r, ∆r) is expanded into a
Taylor series for a given Fokker-Planck equation [33, 36].
To our interpretation this way of estimating the D(k) is
the most advanced one, and performs also better than
ﬁrst parameterizing the M k and then estimating the limit
∆r
0 for this parameterization, as previously suggested
→
in [14, 21].

There have been suggestions to ﬁt other functions to
M (k) than a straight line, especially for the estimation of
D(2), see [21]. Furthermore it has been proposed to use
particular terms of the above-mentioned expansion to di-
rectly determine estimates of D(k)(hr, r) without extrap-
olation [32]. On the other hand, in [37] it becomes clear
that there can be manifold dependences of M (k) on ∆r
which in general are not known for a measured data set.
Consequently, one may state that there is still a demand to
improve the estimation of the D(k). At the present time we
suggest to show the quality of the estimated D(k) by ver-
iﬁcation of the resulting Fokker-Planck equation, once its
drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients have been estimated. How-
ever, for our data neither nonlinear ﬁtting functions nor
correction terms applied to the M (k) resulted in improve-
ments of the estimated D(k).

A crucial point in our estimation procedure is the range
of ∆r where the ﬁt can be performed. Only those ∆r can
be used where Markov properties were found in the scale
domain. In section 5 we showed that for our data Markov
properties are given for ∆r larger than the Markov length
lM (see table 1). In order to reduce uncertainty, a large
range of ∆r as basis of the extrapolation is desirable. From
eq. (22) it can be seen, however, that ∆r must be smaller
than r. As a compromise between accuracy and extending
the scale r to smaller values, in many cases an extrapola-
2 lM was used (cf. table 2). This
tion range of lM ≤
procedure is shown in ﬁg. 15 exemplary for Road 1.

have been estimated in the same way. Thus it can be seen
that in all cases D(4) is small compared to D(2), except for
Road 4, and in most cases its statistical errors are larger
than the values themselves. Negative values are not shown
because the vertical axes start at zero. As M (4) is posi-
tive by deﬁnition, the occurence of negative values of D(4)
results from the limit ∆r
0 and should be only due
→
to statistical errors involved. Even if there is no evidence
that D(4) is identically zero, the presented values give a
hint that its inﬂuence in the Kramers-Moyal expansion
(6) is rather small and the assumption of a Fokker-Planck
equation (9) is justiﬁable, with a possible exception for
Road 4.

Estimated drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients D(1) and D(2)
for the Au surface are shown in ﬁg. 18 for r = 169 nm.
Again, D(4) was added to the plot of D(2), in this case
without error bars to enhance clarity. Errors of D(4) are
in this case always much larger than the values themselves
and would cover the values of D(2) as well as their er-
rors. Also the error bars of D(2) appear to be quite large
for the Au surface. The data here are measured as two-
dimensional images, thus the number of statistically inde-
pendent hr(x) decreases quadratically with increasing r,
resulting in rather large error estimates. For the calcula-
tion of D(k) nevertheless all accessible hr(x) were used.
As the regime of Markov properties starts at ∆r = 25 nm,
the range 25 nm
84 nm was used as basis for the
extrapolation (see table 2). For r < 84 nm the upper limit
was reduced in order to derive the coeﬃcients also for
smaller scales r (compare also section 6). In this way drift
and diﬀusion coeﬃcients of the Au ﬁlm could be worked
out from 281 down to 56 nm.

In the same way as for the other surfaces, estimations
of the Kramers-Moyal coeﬃcients were performed for the
steel crack. Results are shown in ﬁg. 19. Again, also the
estimates for D(4) are presented, which are of the same
order of magnitude as D(2) for higher values of hr (

Fig. 15. Extrapolation procedure for D(1) (a) and D(2) (b),
illustrated at surface Road 1. Length scale r is 108 mm, hr
is −σ∞. Values of M (1) and M (2) inside the range marked
by broken lines were used for the extrapolation. The results
D(1)(hr, r) and D(2)(hr, r) are marked with ﬁlled circles on
the vertical axis.

6.1 Estimation results

Following the procedure outlined above, D(1)(hr, r) and
D(2)(hr, r) were derived for the measurement data pre-
sented in section 3, with an exception for Road 5 (see
below). For the road surfaces, estimations were performed
for length scales r separated by ten measurement steps
or 10.4 mm, respectively, to reach a suﬃcient density over
the range where the coeﬃcients were accessible. Figures 16
and 17 show estimations of the drift coeﬃcients D(1) and
the diﬀusion coeﬃcients D(2) for the road surfaces, each
performed for one ﬁxed length scale r. The error bars are
estimated from the errors of M (k)(hr, r, ∆r) via the num-
ber of statistically independent events contributing to each
h0, r0) containing
value, assuming that each bin of p(h1, r1|
√N . Addition-
N events has an intrinsic uncertainty of
ally, values of D(4) are added to the plots of D(2) which

For the surface Road 5 (cf. ﬁg. 8) drift and diﬀusion
coeﬃcients could not be estimated. The reason can be
seen in ﬁg. 20. The diagram shows the dependence of
M (1)(hr, r, ∆r) and M (2)(hr, r, ∆r) on ∆r for ﬁxed r and
0.6σ∞. For ∆r > lM it
hr, in this case 104 mm and
can be seen that M (1) and M (2) behave like 1/∆r. This
behaviour can be explained by the presence of some ad-
ditional uncorrelated noise, where additional means inde-
pendent of the stochastic process. A similar behaviour was
found for ﬁnancial market data [38]. In this case the inte-
gral in eq. (22) will tend to a constant for small ∆r, inde-
pendent of the value of ∆r. Because we divide the integral
by ∆r, the M (k) will then diverge when ∆r approaches
zero. Note that within the same mathematical framework
the presence of uncorrelated noise can be quantitatively
determined [33].

6.2 Conclusions on the estimation of drift and
diﬀusion coeﬃcients

Estimations of drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients D(1)(hr, r)
and D(2)(hr, r) have been performed for all surfaces in-
troduced in section 3. An exception is Road 5, where the
stochastic process in the scale variable, while still Marko-
vian, appears to be dominated by additional uncorrelated
noise. From eqs. (7) and (8) it can be seen that this leads
to diverging Kramers-Moyal coeﬃcients D(k), as it was
the case for Road 5.

As mentioned above, the magnitude of the fourth Kra-
mers-Moyal coeﬃcient D(4) is of particular importance. If
D(4) can be taken as zero, the whole scale dependent com-
plexity can be described by a Fokker-Planck equation. If
otherwise D(4) is not zero, an inﬁnite set of D(k) is neces-
sary. In terms of a Langevin equation (11), for D(4)
= 0 no
Gaussian noise is present. This case is related to unsteady
stochastic processes [39]. As we see from the topographies
in ﬁgs. 1 and 9, jumps are more likely to be present for
the surfaces Road 4 and Crack than for the remaining
ones. This impression is consistent with the result that
here we ﬁnd D(4)
= 0. As a consequence, in these cases
the Fokker-Planck equation with drift and diﬀusion coeﬃ-
cient is not suﬃcient to describe the stochastic process in
the scale variable, because the higher coeﬃcients cannot
be neglected. The reconstruction of conditional probabil-
ities (cf. section 7) failed for these surfaces.

The range of scales where drift and diﬀusion coeﬃ-
cients could be estimated varies for the diﬀerent surfaces,
depending on the Markov length on the one side and on
the length of the measured proﬁles on the other side. In the
case of Road 2 an additional upper limit for the Markov
properties was caused by the inﬂuence of a strong period-
icity of the pavement.

section 4.1.

7.2 Reconstruction of empirical pdf

Next, we want to actually evaluate the precision of our
results. Therefore we return to eq. (9). Knowing D(1) and
D(2) it should be possible to calculate the pdf of hr with
the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation. Equation (9)
can be integrated over h0 and is then valid also for the
unconditional pdf:

In the previous section methods to estimate the Kramers-
Moyal coeﬃcients were discussed. We found that this esti-
mation is not trivial. To prove the quality of the estimated
D(k) we now want to verify the according Fokker-Planck
equations.

7.1 Parameterization of Drift and Diﬀusion
Coeﬃcients

With the estimations of drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcient from
section 6 for each surface a Fokker-Planck equation (9)
is deﬁned which should describe the according process.
For the veriﬁcation of these coeﬃcients it is addition-
ally desirable to generate parameterizations which deﬁne
D(1)(hr, r) and D(2)(hr, r) not only at discrete values but
at arbitrary points in the (hr, r)-plane.

Such parameterizations have already been shown in
ﬁgs. 16, 17, 18, and 19, as lines together with the esti-
mated discrete values. For D(1) it can be seen that for all
surfaces a straight line with negative slope was used, with
additional cubic terms for Road 2, Road 4, and Crack.
The diﬀusion coeﬃcients were in all cases parameterized
as parabolic functions. The special shape of the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient for Road 2 was parameterized as one inner and
one outer parabola for small and larger values of hr, re-
spectively (compare ﬁg. 17). We would like to note that
both drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients of the cobblestone road
presented in [12] are best ﬁtted by piecewise linear func-
tions with steeper slopes for larger hr.

It is easy to verify that with linear D(1) and constant
D(2) the Fokker-Planck equation (9) describes a Gaus-
sian process, while with a parabolic D(2) the distributions
become non-Gaussian, also called intermittent or heavy
tailed. For the Au surface it can be seen in ﬁg. 18 that D(2)
has only a weak quadratic dependence on hr and possi-
bly could also be interpreted as constant (we nevertheless
kept the small quadratic term because it is conﬁrmed by
the veriﬁcation procedure below). If D(2) is constant in hr
the type of noise in the according Langevin equation (11)
is no longer multiplicative but additive, which results in
Gaussian noise in the process. Thus the statistics of hr in
r will always stay Gaussian, and all moments
with
n > 2 can be expressed by the ﬁrst and second one. As
a further consequence, the scaling exponents ξn (see sec-
hn
2 ξ2. This
tion 4) are obtained by
r i ∼ h
h
linear dependence on n denotes self-aﬃnity rather than

n/2 as ξn = n

Now at the largest scale r0 where drift and diﬀusion coeﬃ-
cients could be worked out the empirical pdf is parameter-
ized and used as initial condition for a numerical solution
of eq. (23). For several values of r the reconstructed pdf is
compared to the respective empirical pdf, as shown below
in this section. If our Fokker-Planck equation successfully
reproduces these single scale pdf also the structure func-
tions

can easily be obtained.

A second veriﬁcation is the reconstruction of condi-
tional pdf by numerical solution of Fokker-Planck equa-
tion (9) for the conditional pdf. Reconstructing the condi-
tional pdf this way is much more sensitive to deviations in
D(1) and D(2). This becomes evident by the fact that the
conditional pdf (and not the unconditional pdf of ﬁgs. 21
and 23) determine D(1) and D(2) and thus the stochas-
tic process, see eqs. (7) and (8). It is also the knowledge
of the conditional pdf which gives access to the complete
n-scale joint pdf (eq. 4). Here again the diﬀerence to the
multiscaling analysis becomes clear, which analyses higher
moments
p(hr) dhr of hr, and does not de-
pend on conditional pdf. It is easy to show that there are
many diﬀerent stochastic processes which lead to the same
single scale pdf p(hr).

For both veriﬁcation procedures we use a technique
which is mentioned in [22] and has already been used
in [12, 14]. An approximative solution of Fokker-Planck
eq. (9) for inﬁnitesimally small steps ∆r over which D(k)
can be taken as constant in r, is known [22]

A necessary condition for a Markov process is the valid-
ity of the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation (21) [22], which
allows to combine two conditional pdf with adjacent in-
tervals in r into one conditional pdf spanning the sum
of both intervals. By iterative application of these two
relations we are able to obtain conditional probabilities

r, given that for all involved scales ri the drift and diﬀu-
sion coeﬃcients are known.

In the following the results of this veriﬁcation proce-
dure are shown for those surfaces where drift and diﬀu-
sion coeﬃcients of the Fokker-Planck equation could be
obtained.

7.3 Veriﬁcation results

Results of the reconstruction of unconditional pdf for the
road surfaces with scaling properties are presented in ﬁg. 21.
The pdf of Road 1 show at smaller scales a peak around
5 σ∞ which is not reproduced by our Fokker-Planck equa-
tion because in this regime of hr D(1) and D(2) could
not be estimated with suﬃcient precision. Here it has to
be noted that according to eq. (12) σ∞ > σr for any r,
and thus 5 σ∞ is a large value for a pdf, denoting quite
rare events (the r-dependence of σr has been presented
by S2(r) = σ2
r , see section 4). The magnitudes of the esti-
mated drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients had to be adjusted by
a factor of 0.65 to give optimal results in the reconstruc-
tion. For Road 2 it is likely that the correspondence be-
tween emprical and reconstructed pdf could be improved
by a more advanced parameterization of the nontrivial
shape especially of the estimated drift coeﬃcient, compare
ﬁg. 16. Here, the estimated drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients
could be used without adjustment. The reconstructed pdf
for Road 3 are in perfect agreement with the empirical
ones. A substantial adjustment factor of 0.20 for D(1) and
0.26 for D(2) was necessary to achieve the best result.

Reconstructed conditional pdf are shown in ﬁg. 22 for
the road surfaces. While there are deviations for larger
values of h0, h1, the overall agreement between empirical
and reconstructed pdf is good. Especially the rather com-
plicated shape of the conditional pdf of Road 2 appears to
be well modelled by our coeﬃcients D(1), D(2). As men-
tioned above, an improved parameterization of D(1) may
lead to even better results. The magnitudes of D(1), D(2)
were adjusted by the same factors as for the unconditional
pdf above.

In the case of the Au ﬁlm drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients
could be worked out from 281 down to 56 nm, compare sec-
tion 6. In contrast to this regime, the range of correlation
between scales is only about 40 nm, i.e., height increments
on scales which are separated by at least 40 nm are un-
correlated. Nevertheless, both veriﬁcation procedures out-
lined in section 7 gave good results over the whole range
from 281 to 56 nm as shown in ﬁg. 23. Here the estimated
D(1) and D(2)(hr, r) were multiplied by factors 1.3 and
2.2, respectively.

7.4 Discussion of the veriﬁcation procedure

For the veriﬁcation of the drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients es-
timated in section 6 numerical solutions of Fokker-Planck
equations (9) and (23) have been performed using these
estimations. The reconstructed pdf have been compared
to the empirical ones to validate the descripition of the

the according Fokker-Planck equation.

Good results were obtained for most surfaces where
drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients could be derived. In the case
of Road 4 and Crack we found that the higher Kramers-
Moyal coeﬃcients D(3) and D(4) were signiﬁcantly diﬀer-
ent from zero, and the empirical pdf could not be repro-
duced with a Fokker-Planck equation (which only uses
D(1) and D(2)).

M. Waechter et al.: Stochastic analysis of diﬀerent rough surfaces

It may be surprising that the correspondence between
empirical and reconstructed pdf seems better for the con-
ditional than for the unconditional pdf in some cases (com-
pare ﬁgs. 21 and 22). One reason may be that in ﬁg. 22
it becomes visible that the empirical pdf are not precisely
deﬁned for combinations of large h0 and h1. Thus the eye
concentrates at the central regions of the contour plots
where the uncertainty of the empirical pdf is reduced, as
well as deviations due to possible inaccuracies and uncer-
tainties of our drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients. This eﬀect
is also conﬁrmed by our mathematical framework where
all steps in the procedure are based on the estimation and
evaluation of conditional (not the unconditional) pdf.

The reconstruction procedure allows also to adjust the
estimated coeﬃcients in order to improve the mentioned
description, thus compensating a number of uncertainties
in the estimation process. While the functional form of
D(1) and D(2) found in section 6 for all surfaces could be
conﬁrmed, in most cases the magnitudes of the estimated
values had to be adjusted to give satisfactory results in
this reconstruction procedure. We found this eﬀect also
when analysing turbulent velocities and ﬁnancial data.
As one reason, the uncertainties of the estimation pro-
cedure could be guessed. A second source of deviations
may be that the dependence of M (k)(hr, r, ∆r) on ∆r is
not always purely linear in the extrapolation range (see
section 6). Thus ﬁtting a straight line and extrapolating
against ∆r = 0 may lead to coeﬃcients D(1) and D(2)
which still have the correct functional form in hr but in-
correct magnitudes. As mentioned in section 6, in our case
no general improvements could be achieved by the use of
nonlinear (i.e. polynomial) ﬁtting functions or higher or-
der terms of the according Taylor expansion. It is possible
that the range of ∆r < lM where no Markov properties are
given is in most cases large enough that approximations
for small ∆r are inaccurate. We would like to note that
there are also data sets which did not require any adjust-
ment of the estimated coeﬃcients, see Road 2 and [12]. A
last remark concerns latest results in the case of Road 1,
compare ﬁg. 15. If the fraction of M (k)(∆r) which is pro-
portional to 1/∆r is substracted before performing the ex-
trapolation, the resulting D(k) are substantially improved
in their magnitudes. This may be a way to correct the ex-
trapolation of the D(k) in cases where uncorrelated noise
is involved.

In any case, whether an adjustment of D(1) and D(2)
was needed or not, for the presented surfaces a Fokker-
Planck equation was found which reproduces the condi-
tional pdf. Together with the veriﬁcation of the Markov
property (4) thus a complete description of the n-scale
joint pdf is given, which was the aim of our work.

8 Conclusions

describes the statistics of the height increment hr(x) in
the scale variable r. A complete characterization of the
according stochastic process in the sense of multiscale con-
ditional probabilities is the result.

The application to diﬀerent examples of surface mea-
surement data showed that this approach cannot serve as
a universal tool for any surface, as it is also the case for
other methods like those based on self- and multi-aﬃnity.
With given conditions, namely the Markov property and
a vanishing fourth order Kramers-Moyal coeﬃcient (cf.
section 2), on the other hand a comprehensive character-
ization of a single surface is obtained. The features of the
scaling analysis are included, and beyond that a deeper in-
sight in the complexity of roughness is achieved. As shown
in [13] such knowledge about a surface allows the numeri-
cal generation of surface structures which should have the
same complexity. This may be of high interest for many
research ﬁelds based on numerical modelling.

The precise estimation of the magnitudes of drift and
diﬀusion coeﬃcients for surface measurement data remains
still an open problem. While for other applications a num-
ber of approaches have been developed [14,32,36,37] in any
case a veriﬁcation of the estimated Fokker-Planck equa-
tion is necessary and may lead to signiﬁcant adjustments,
as it is the case for some of our data sets.

23. In contrast to other applications (like ﬁnancial data), in
this case the process direction from large to smaller scales
is unimportant and was chosen arbitrarily. When the pro-
cess direction is reversed, the coeﬃcients D(k) change only
slightly, preserving form and behaviour of the Fokker-
Planck equation. The logarithmic variable ρ was used in
order to preserve consistency, see [11, 14, 16].

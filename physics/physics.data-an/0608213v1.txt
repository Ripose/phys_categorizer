In measuring the ψ(2S) radiative decays at BESII, contribution of the background is serious in
most of the ﬁnal states. To extract the number of signal events, a ﬁt to the χ2 distribution of
kinematic ﬁt using signal and background components is proposed. Extensive Monte-Carlo simu-
lations (MCS) are performed, and the results show that the shape of χ2 distribution of the signal
channel looks diﬀerent from those of the background channels, thus it provides us by ﬁtting the χ2
distribution of the data to extract the number of signal events. An input-output test is performed
using MCS, and the uncertainty of the ﬁt method is found to be less than 2%.

INTRODUCTION

which includes 2, 4 and 6 prongs (stable hadron—
pion,kaon,proton or anti-proton).

The radiative decays of J/ψ and ψ′, due to the di-
rect coupling of outgoing photon to the charm quark,
could be an excellent laboratory to study the hadron
spectroscopy and search for exotic states. At the lead-
ing order of pQCD picture, both the J/ψ and ψ radia-
tive decays can be described by the c¯c quark annihila-
tion with the emission of one photon and two gluons.
There could be a possibility that the two gluons might
form a glueball, or one gluon combines with a q ¯q pair
to form a hybrid state, or the two gluons couple to
a multiquark state. Compared with J/ψ decays, few
measurements of ψ(2S) radiative decays have been re-
ported [1]. BESII detector has accumulated 14 million
ψ(2S) events, and it oﬀers an opportunity to study a
number of ψ(2S) radiative decays.

Experimentally, an event is reconstructed by us-
ing the detector information on charged tracks and
photons. For removing background events, the con-
straints of the energy and momentum conservation
for the ﬁnal state of the signal channel are imposed
on the ﬁtting to the 4-component momentum (4C)
reconstructed by the detector, and the background
events can be suppressed by using information of the
distribution of the χ2 of the ﬁt. With the help of
the Monte-Carlo simulation, a reasonable requirement
on χ2 can be obtained by comparing the χ2 distribu-
tions between the signal and the background chan-
nels. However, the χ2 cut method fails badly some-
times if the χ2 distribution of the background channel
overlaps largely with the signal channels. In this pa-
per, we try to ﬁt the χ2 distribution to extract the
number of signal events in measuring the exclusive
decays of ψ(2S) → γ + hadrons at BESII detector,

II. FIT TO THE χ2 DISTRIBUTION

Monte Carlo simulation shows that backgrounds of
the radiative decay of ψ(2S) → γ+hadrons are largely
coming from multi-photon decay channels, namely,
the dominant background is ψ(2S) → π0 + hadrons,
and some contaminations are from ψ(2S) → γπ0 +
hadrons, along with other possible backgrounds. In
principle, their χ2 distributions of the kinematic ﬁt
can be obtained with MCS. Since these types of back-
grounds are due to missing photons, their distribu-
tions of the χ2 shapes are diﬀerent from each other.
This property allows us to express the observed χ2
distributions of the data sample by that of the signal
channel and the background channels, i.e.

obs = wsχ2
χ2

wbi χ2

where ws and wbi are the weight of the signal and the
background decays, respectively.
If the background
channels are completely known, then the signal events
can be extracted reliably by ﬁtting to the data with
Equation (1).

III. MONTE CARLO SIMULATION

A. Background

To make the measurement of ψ′ radiative decays re-
liable, the background should be fully studied. With
the help of SIMBES system [2], extensive simulations
have been performed. Table I summarizes the possi-
ble background contributions to signal mode ψ(2S) →
γ + hadrons. Generally speaking, the dominant back-
grounds come from multi-photon decays, i.e. ψ(2S) →
nγ + hadrons (n ≥ 2). With more missing photons in

background decays, the contamination to the signal
decay becomes lower and lower.

ground events are based on 14M ψ(2S) events and the
branching fractions given in PDG table with require-
ment mhadrons < 3.0 GeV.

B. χ2 distribution

Figure 1 shows the shapes of χ2 distributions for
ψ(2S) → γ + hadrons after data selection. In plots
the points with error bars are the signal decays
into γp¯p (a), γK +K −π+π− (b), γ2(π+π−) (c) and
γK +K −2(π+π−) (d), respectively. The dashed his-
tograms and the solid line histograms correspond to
the distributions of the background channels ψ(2S) →
π0 + hadrons and γπ0 + hadrons, respectively. For
comparison of their shapes, the background events are
respectively normalized to signal events. Obviously
it can be seen that the shapes of the signal χ2 dis-
tributions are diﬀerent from those of the background
modes. This could be understandable due to the fact
that the expectation of the χ2 value of the kinematic
ﬁt becomes larger to the backgrounds originated from
one or more photons missing.

C.

Input-output check of χ2 ﬁt method

Since the dominant backgrounds of ψ(2S) radiative
decays originate from the photon missing decays, and
their shapes are diﬀerent from each other, therefore,
ﬁtting the χ2 distribution of the data with Equation
(1) provides us a tool to extract the signal events.
We employ MCS to make an input-output check and
estimate the uncertainty of the χ2 ﬁt method.

Figure 2 shows the χ2 distributions of the MC
sample for ψ(2S) decays into γK +K −π+π− (a),
π0K +K −π+π− (b) and other unknown backgrounds
by using 14M ψ(2S) Lund-Charm MC sample.
In
order to make an input-output check of the χ2 ﬁt
method, a MC sample is generated with the χ2 shapes
given in (a), (b) and (c) with an input number N in

background, the uncertainty of extracting the number
of the dominant background becomes large by χ2 ﬁt
method. However, this situation does not worsen the
signal uncertainty. The MCS with a large statistics
shows that the uncertainty of the χ2 ﬁt method is less
than 2%.

Based on MCS, it is found that the backgrounds of
the ψ(2S) decays into γ + hadrons dominantly orig-
inate from the missing photon decays like ψ(2S) →
nγ + hadrons (n ≥ 2). The χ2 distribution shapes
of backgrounds are distinctive from those of the sig-
nal decays. This property allows us to extract the
number of the signal events by the ﬁt to the χ2 dis-
tribution. The results of MCS study indicate that the
uncertainty of the extracted signal events from the
method is less than 2%.

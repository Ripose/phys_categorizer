Abstract—
The Bayesian Land Surface Temperature estimator pre-
viously developed has been extended to include the eﬀects
of imperfectly known gain and oﬀset calibration errors. It
is possible to treat both gain and oﬀset as nuisance param-
eters and, by integrating over an uninformitave range for
their magnitudes, eliminate the dependence of surface tem-
perature and emissivity estimates upon the exact calibration
error.

Keywords— Remote Sensing, Land Surface Temperature,

Sea Surface Temperature.

I. Introduction

AS a practical matter, land surface temperature (LST)

estimates retrieved from radiances reported by a re-
mote sensor will be subject to some unavoidable level of
calibration error, which need not be very accurately known.
While all forms of quantitative exploitation of radiometric
data in remote sensing are aﬄicted to some degree by cali-
bration error eﬀects, this problem may be a special concern
for the Bayesian multiband LST algorithm [1]. That is be-
cause the Bayesian algorithm iterates on a range of plausi-
ble surface temperatures, within which the estimated LST
value is obtained as an expected value. Should uncom-
pensated calibration errors lead to a temperature interval
which does not bracket the true surface temperature, the
algorithm in its present form has no way to recover, and
may return a surface temperature estimate with degraded
accuracy.

This note sketches the extension of the Bayesian ap-
proach to LST retrieval to include eﬀects of a simple form of
unknown calibration error. After a review of the Bayesian
approach to LST retrieval, the calibration error is param-
eterized as linear in the true aperture radiance. The joint
prior probalility for the calibration error parameters is then
obtained by imposing the requirement that two distinct
observers agree on its mathematical form. Finally, the
Bayesian LST estimator is extended to include linear cal-
ibration error by treating the calibration error parameters
as nuisance variables, and integrating them out of the ﬁnal
estimators for surface temperature and emissivity.

sumed linear in surface emissivity:

k (0) are the upwelling diﬀuse radiance at
nadir optical depth τ (top of the atmosphere, or TOA,
for spaceborne sensors; µ is the cosine of the angle with
respect to zenith) and the downwelling irradiance at the
surface, respectively. Bk(T ) is the Planck function at sur-
face temperature T . The emissivity is ǫk, and the surface
reﬂectance ρk = 1
ǫk. Note that (1) assumes Khirchoﬀ’s
law; this is done solely for simplicity. It is also assumed (at
least initially) that the sensor has high spectral resolution.

III. Calibration error model

By hypothesis, the physical radiance I0 at wavenumber

k is related linearly to the reported radiance I:

I0 = (1 + α)I + β

α << 1

β << I0

(5)

(7)

II. Elements of Bayesian LST estimator

Both α and β are assumed to be small quantities;

The Bayesian land surface temperature retrieval algo-
rithm is developed in [1], which may be consulted for de-
tails. The approach to LST retrieval presented in that
earlier paper consists of three elements:

and

2

(18)

It is the physical radiance I0 which goes into (1). Recalling
that the forward model (1) is linear in ǫ, the exponent in
that expression is

(I0 −

IF )2 = (((1 + α)I + β)

(Aǫ + B))2

(8)

which is quadratic in α, β, and ǫ.

IV. Prior probability for calibration error

if Vladimir and Estragon are to agree that the quantity
I(k) admits interpretation as a radiance. The ratio

(1 + α)I(k)
I0(k)

=

(1+α)I(k)
k3
I0(k)
k3

is likewise invariant, so that

parameters

1 + α = invariant,

(19)

In order to obtain a useable estimator, it is necessary
to ﬁnd the prior probability for the calibration error pa-
rameters α and β [5],[6],[7]. As in [1], two equally cogent
observers must relate their descriptions of radiance, and of
calibration error, by a Lorentz transformation [8],[9] con-
necting one (primed) coordinate description moving with
velocity v along the observation axis with respect to the
other (unprimed) one by

as it must be, as the ratio of two radiances evaluated in the
same Lorentz frame. Thus

α′(k′) = α(k) = α(k′)

(20)

Next consider β. We have

(1 + α)I + β
k3

= invariant

(21)

k′ = ηk

By (9) we ﬁnd

(22)

β′(k′) = β′(ηk) = η3β(k)

The Jacobian is therefore

∂(α, β)

(cid:21)

(23)

(10)

The quantity η is real and nonvanishing for physical
Lorentz transformations. Let

so Vladimir and Estragon must agree that

P (α, β

K) = g(α, β)dαdβ

(12)

g(α, β)dαdβ = η3h(α′, β′)dα′dβ′

(25)

be the prior probability assigned by Vladimir in the un-
primed frame, and

and, by the principle of indiﬀerence [1],[5], that

g(α, β)) = η3g(α, η3β))

(26)

P (α′, β′

K) = h(α′, β′)dα′dβ′

(13)

with solution

be that assigned by Estragon, viewing radiance in the
primed frame. The prior probabilities in the two frames
are related by

h(α′, β′)dα′dβ′ = J −1g(α, β)dαdβ

g(α, β)dαdβ =

dβdα

(27)

β

Application of Bayes’ theorem (4), as in [1], immediately
gives the result that the joint posterior probability of T , ǫ,
α, and β is proportional to the product of (2), (3), and
(27):

(15)

J = det

Estimators for T and ǫ may be constructed from (28)
as expectation values in exactly the same manner as in [1].
The treatment of spectral quantities integrated over a pass-
band follows the equivalent discussion in [1]. In practice,
(28) will be unaltered for band-integrated radiances.

In (33), as in (28), the sensor radiance that appear in the
quantites a, b, and c is related to the physical radiance by
(5).

The remaining integration over the nuisance variables α
and β is now two-dimensional, and any integration over T
makes for a third quadra-
T
to form the expectation value

ture, for the full calculation. This is potentially awkward
for routine evaluation, but the computational burden can
be alleviated in special cases:

1. If one knows a-priori that one is operating in a regime
dominated by either gain or oﬀset calibration error, the
less important source of error may be ignored as a ﬁrst

It does not appear feasible to integrate moments of (28)
in closed form. However, by integrating over ǫ ﬁrst, it is
possible to take advantage of the closed-form result for the

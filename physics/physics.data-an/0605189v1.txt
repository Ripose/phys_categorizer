We discuss a general method to construct correlated binomial distributions by imposing several
consistent relations on the joint probability function. We obtain self-consistency relations for the
conditional correlations and conditional probabilities. The beta-binomial distribution is derived
by a strong symmetric assumption on the conditional correlations. Our derivation clariﬁes the
’correlation’ structure of the beta-binomial distribution. It is also possible to study the correlation
structures of other probability distributions of exchangeable (homogeneous) correlated Bernoulli
random variables. We study some distribution functions and discuss their behaviors in terms of
their correlation structures.

INTRODUCTION

Incorporation of correlation ρ into Bernoulli random variables Xi(i = 1, 2, · · · N ) taking the value 1 with probability
p and taking the value 0 with probability 1 − p has long history and have been widely discussed in a variety of areas of
science, mathematics and engineering. Writing the expectation value of a random variable A as < A >, the correlation
ρ between Xi and Xj is deﬁned as

ρ = Corr(Xi, Xj) =

< XiXj > − < Xi >< Xj >
< Xi > (1− < Xi >) < Xj > (1− < Xj >)

.

p

If there are no correlation between the random variables, the number n of the variables taking the value 1 obeys
the binomial probability distribution b(N, p). The necessity of the correlation ρ comes from the facts that there are
many phenomena where dependency structures in the random events are crucial or are necessary for the explanation
of experimental data.

For example, in biometrics, the teratogenic or toxicological eﬀect of certain compounds was studied [1, 2, 3]. The
interest resides in the number of aﬀected fetuses or implantation in a litter. One parameter models, such as the Poisson
distribution and binomial distributions provided poor ﬁts to the experimental data. A two-parameter alternative to
the above distributions, beta-binomial distribution (BBD), has been proposed [1, 2]. In the model, the probability p′
of the binomial distribution b(N, p′) is also a random variable and obeys the beta distribution Be(α, β).

The resulting distribution has probability function

P (p′) =

p

θ is a measure of the variation in p′ and is called as “correlation level” [4]. The case of pure binomial distribution
corresponds to θ = 0. However, true “correlation” of the BBD is given as

The derivation of the relation is straightforward.

In the area of computer engineering, in the context of the design of survivable storage system, the modeling of the
correlated failures among storage nodes is a hot topic [4]. In addition to BBD, a correlated binomial model based
on conditional failure probabilities has been proposed. The same kind of correlated binomial distribution based on
conditional probabilities has also been introduced in ﬁnancial engineering. There, credit portfolio modeling has been
extensively studied [5, 6]. In particular, the modeling default correlation plays central role in the pricing of portfolio
credit derivatives, which are developed in order to manage the risk of joint default or the clustering of default. As a
default distribution model for homogeneous (exchangeable) credit portfolio where the assets’ default probabilities and
default correlations are uniform and denoted as p and ρ, Witt has introduced a correlated binomial model based on the
conditional default probabilities pn [7]. Describing the defaulted (non-defaulted) state of i-th asset by Xi = 1 (X = 0)
and the joint default probability function by P (x1, x2, · · · , xN ), pn are deﬁned as

pn =< Xn+1|

Xn′ = 1 > .

Here < A|B > means the expectation value of a random variable A under the condition that B is satisﬁed. The
n
n′=1 Xn′ = 1 corresponds to the situation
expectation value of Xi signiﬁes the default probability and the condition
where the ﬁrst n assets among N are defaulted. p0 = p and from the homogeneity (exchangeability ) assumption,
n
n′=1 Xn′ = 1. Xn+1 in eq.(8) is also substituted by
any n assets among N can be chosen in the n default condition
anyone which is not used in the n default condition.

In order to ﬁx the joint default probability function completely, it is necessary to impose N conditions on them
from the homogeneity assumption. Witt and the authors have imposed the following condition on the conditional
correlations [7, 8].

The joint default probability function and the default distribution function PN (n) has been expressed with these
pn explicitly. However, the expression has many ± contributions and it is not an easy task to evaluate them for
N ≥ 100. In addition, the range of parameters p and ρ are also restricted and one cannot study the large correlation
regime. Furthermore, for p = 0.5 case, the distribution does not have the Z2 symmetry as PN (n) = PN (N − n). The
distribution has irregular shape and for some choice of parameters, it shows singular rippling.

In this paper, we propose a general method to construct correlated binomial models (CBM) based on the consistent
conditions on the conditional probabilities and the conditional correlations. With the method, it is possible to study the

correlation structure for any probability distribution function for exchangeable correlated Bernoulli random variables.
The organization of the paper is as follows. In section II, we introduce conditional probabilities pij and conditional
correlations ρij and show how to construct CBMs. We prove that the construction is self-consistent. In addition, in
order to assure the probability conservation or the normalization, the conditional correlations and the probabilities
should satisfy self-consistent relations. We also calculate the moments < nk > of the model.
In the course, we
introduce a linear operator H which gives the joint probabilities in the “binomial” expansion of (p + q)N . Section
III is devoted to some solutions of the self-consistent relations. We obtain the beta-binomial distribution (BBD)
with strong symmetric assumptions on the conditional correlations. For other probability distribution functions
which include the Witt’s model and the distributions constructed by the superposition of the binomial distributions
(Bernoulli mixture model), we calculate pij and ρij . We study the probability distribution functions for these solutions
from the viewpoint of their correlation structures ρij . We conclude with some remarks and future problems in section
IV.

In this section, we construct the joint probabilities and the distribution functions of CBMs. We introduce the

following deﬁnitions. The ﬁrst one is the products of Xi and 1 − Xj and they include all observables of the model.

The following deﬁnitions are their unconditional and conditional expectation values (see Figure 1.).

In order to estimate Xij, we need to calculate the products of pkl and qkl from (0, 0) to (i, j). As the path, we can
choose anyone and the product must not depend on the choice. This property is guaranteed by the next condition on

pij and qij as

In order for pij and qij to satisfy these conditions, we introduce the following conditional correlations

qi+1j · pij = pij+1 · qij =

Xi+1j+1
Xij

.

Corr(Xi+j+1, Xi+j+2|Πij = 1) = ρij .

We set ρ00 = ρ. (1 − Xi+j+1) and (1 − Xi+j+2) are also correlated with the same strength and the following relations
hold.

From these relation, we obtain the recursive relations for pij and qij as

Corr((1 − Xi+j+1), (1 − Xi+j+2)|Πij = 1) = ρij.

If we assume the identity pij + qij = 1, we obtain qij = 1 − pij, qi+1j = 1 − pi+1j = (1 − pij)(1 − ρij) and
pij+1 = 1 − qij+1 = pij (1 − ρij ). Then qi+1j · pij = pij+1 · qij = pij (1 − pij)(1 − ρij ) holds and we see that the above
consistency relation (14) does hold.

pi+1j = pij + (1 − pij)ρij
qij+1 = qij + (1 − qij )ρij .

FIG. 2: Proof of the commutation relation qi+1j · pij = pij+1 · qij .

The remaining consistency relations or the probability conservation identity is pij + qij = 1. We prove the identity
by the inductive method. For i = j = 0, the identity holds trivially as p00 + q00 = p + q = 1. For j = 0 or i = 0,
qi0 and p0j are calculated as qi0 = 1 − pi0 and p0j = 1 − q0j and the identity also holds trivially. Then we assume
pij−1 + qij−1 = 1 and prove the identity pij + qij = 1. From the recursive equations (17) on pij and qij , we have the
following relations.

For the identity to be satisﬁed, the conditional correlation ρij−1 and ρi−1j must satisfy the following relations.

1 = pij + qij
= pi−1j + (1 − pi−1j)ρi−1j + (1 − pij−1) + pij−1ρij−1.

pi−1j − pij−1 = −(1 − pi−1j )ρi−1j − pij−1ρij−1.

If the conditional correlations ρij are ﬁxed so as to satisfy the relations, the model becomes self-consistent. In other
words, it guarantees the normalization of the resulting probability distribution.

FIG. 3: Picture for the pij + qij = 1 condition.

We estimate the moments of CBM. For the purpose, we introduce following operators H and Dk. The former one
is a linear operator H which maps polynomial in p, q to joint probabilities ∈ R. By its linearity, we only need to ﬁx
its action on monomial piqj as

H[piqj] = p00p10 · · · pi−10qi0qi1 · · · qij−1.

(20)

The joint probability XnN −n is expressed as XnN −n = H[pnqN −n]. Here we choose the far left path from (0, 0) to
(n, N − n) on the Pascal’s triangle (See Figure 1). The action of H on the binomial expansion (p + q)N = 1N can be
interpreted as the probability distribution and its normalization condition.

In order to calculate the moments of CBM, it is necessary to put nk in the above summation. Instead, we will put
n(n − 1)(n − 2) · · · (n − k + 1) and introduce the following diﬀerential operators Dk.

Dk =

pi10pi20 · · · pik0

The action of Dk on XnN −n for n ≥ k is

On the other hand, the same expression can be obtained as

DkXnN −n = n(n − 1)(n − 2) · · · (n − k + 1)XnN −n.

H[pk dk

dpk pnqN −n] = H[n(n − 1)(n − 2) · · · (n − k + 1)pnqN −n] = n(n − 1)(n − 2) · · · (n − k + 1)XnN −n.

(24)

This relation deﬁnes the action of Dk on the operator H with any polynomial f (p, q) as

DkH[f (p, q)] = H[pk dk

dpk f (p, q)].

The calculation of the expectation value of n(n − 1) · · · (n − k + 1) is performed by the action of operator Dk on the

The right hand side is nothing but the expectation value < n(n − 1)(n − 2) · · · (n − k + 1) >. The left hand side is
calculated by using eq.(25) as

dpk (p + q)N ] = N (N − 1)(N − 2) · · · (N − k + 1)H[pk(p + q)N −k]

(27)

We obtain the relation,

(28)

From the relation, we can estimate the moments of CBM.

III. BETA-BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION AND OTHER SOLUTIONS

In the previous section, we have derived self-consistent equations for pij and ρij. They are summarized as

pi+1j = pij + (1 − pij)ρij
pij+1 = pij − pijρij

pi−1j − pij−1 = −(1 − pi−1j)ρi−1j − pij−1ρij−1.

In this section, we show several solutions to these equation. We note, if one knows joint probabilities Xij, from the
deﬁnitions for pij and qij, we can estimate pij. Then ρij are estimated from the recursive equation (29). In addition,
we interpret the behaviors of the solutions from the viewpoint of correlation structures.

A. Beta-binomial Distribution

In order to solve the above relations on ρij and pij, we use the symmetry viewpoint. For p = 1

2 case, the model
should have particle-hole duality between X and 1 − X or Z2 symmetry. Then ρij = ρji should hold. We put stronger
assumption that for any p, the system has the Z2 symmetry and ρij depends on i, j only through the combination
n = i + j. With a suitable choice of indexes i → i + 1 and j = n − i, eq.(31) reduces to

pin−i − pi+1n−i−1 = ρn(−1 + pin−i − pi+1n−i−1).

From this relation, we see that pij with the same n = i + j consist a arithmetic sequence with the common diﬀerence
∆n.

∆n satisfy the following equation

ρn can be solved with ∆n as

pi+1n−i−1 − pin−i = ∆n.

∆n = ρn(1 + ∆n).

ρn =

∆n
1 + ∆n

.

From the relation (29) for pij, we obtain the following recursive relation for ρn as,

ρn =

∆n
1 + ∆n

=

∆n−1(1 − ρn−1)
1 + ∆n−1(1 − ρn−1)

Here q = 1 − p. By multiplying the binomial coeﬃcients N Cn, we obtain the distribution function PN (n) as

PN (n) = N Cn · XnN −n.

This distribution is nothing but the beta-binomial distribution function (see eq.(3)) with suitable replacements (p, ρ) ↔
(α, β) .

B. Moody’s Correlated Binomial Model

In the original work by Witt, he assumed ρi,0 = ρ for all i [7]. We call this model as Moody’s Correlated Binomial
(MCB) model. The above consistent equations are diﬃcult to solve and the available analytic expressions are those
for pi0 as pi0 = 1 − (1 − p)(1 − ρ)i. With the result, we only have a formal expression for Xij as

Xij = < Πij >=<

(43)

With this expression, it is possible to estimate pij ,qij and ρij from their deﬁnitions. However, equation (43) contains
jCk(−1)k and as N becomes large, it becomes diﬃcult to estimate them. With the above choice for ρi0 = ρ, it is
possible to set N = 30. If ρi0 damps as exp(−λi) with some positive λ, we can set at most N = 100 for small values
of ρ and p.

C. Mixed Binomial Models: Bernoulli Mixture Models

Bernoulli mixture model with some mixing probability distribution function f (p), the expression for the joint

probability function Xij is calculated with

Xij =< Πij >=

dpf (p)pi(1 − p)j.

(44)

Z

0

If we use the beta distribution for f (p), we obtain eq.(41). However, this does not mean that it is trivial to solve
the consistent equations with the assumption ρij = ρi+j and obtain the BBD. The consistent equations completely

determine any correlated binomial distribution for exchangeable Bernoulli random variables. Every correlated binomial
distributions obey the relations. With the assumption ρij = ρi+j , we are automatically lead to the BBD. That is, the
probability distribution with the symmetry ρij = ρi+j, we prove that it is the BBD. No other probability distribution
has the symmetry.

Here we consider the relation between CBM and Bernoulli Mixture model. According to De Finetti’s theorem, the
probability distribution of any inﬁnite exchangeable Bernoulli random variables can be expressed by a mixture of the
binomial distribution [10]. CBM in the N → ∞ limit should be expressed by such a mixture. From eq.(44), we have
f (p)pkdp. Xk0 is expressed as Xk0 = p00p10 · · · pk−10, we have
the relation P (x1 = 1, x2 = 1, · · · , xk = 1) = Xk0 =
a correspondence between the moments of f (p) and a CBM. That is, if one knows pi0 for any i, we know the mixing
function f (p) and vice versa. This correspondence shows the equivalence of CBM and the Bernoulli mixture model
in the large N limit. But CBMs with ﬁnite N can describe probability distribution more widely. In the Bernoulli
mixture model, the variance of p is positive and the correlation ρ cannot be taken negative. In CBM, we can set ρ
negative for small system size N . In addition, CBM is useful to construct the probability distribution and discuss
about the correlation structure. Particularly we can understand the symmetry of the solution. For example, we want
to have Z2 symmetry distributions. In the Bernoulli mixture model, we need to impose on f (p) as

R

Z

f (p)(p − 0.5)2k+1dp = 0,

where k = 1, 2, · · · . On the other hand, in CBM, we only need to seek a solution with pii = qii = 1
constraint is useful in the construction and in the parameter calibration of CBMs.

2 . This simple

As other mixing functions f (p), we consider the cases which correspond to the long-range Ising model with some
strength of magnitude of correlation ρ > 0. It has some correlation only in the regime where the probability distribution
for the magnetization p(m) has two peaks at m1, m2 for T < Tc [9].
If the system size N is large enough, the
distribution can be approximated with the superposition of two binomial distributions. If we take N → ∞ for T < Tc,
the system loses its ergodicity and the phase space breaks up into two space with m > 0 and m < 0 [11] and the
correlation disappears. Even if there appears two peaks in p(m), only one of them represents the real equilibrium
state.

The precise values of m1 and m2 depend on the model parameters, we consider the cases which correspond to
p = 0.5 (Z2 symmetric case) and p ≃ 0. For the Z2 symmetric case, there is no external ﬁeld and m1 = −m2 holds.
Between the Bernoulli random variable X and the Ising Spin variable S, there exists a mapping X = 1
2 (1 − S). f (p)
has two peaks at p and q = 1 − p with the same height. On the other hand, for T ≃ 0 and inﬁnitely weak positive
external ﬁeld case ∼ O( 1
N ), p(m) has one tall peak at m1 ≃ 1 and another short peak at m2 ≃ −1. In the language
of the Bernoulli random variable case, f (p) has a tall peak at p′ = p′′ ≃ 0 and a short peak at p′ ≃ 1. We consider
the following mixing functions and call them Two-Binomial models.

• f (p′) = 1

2 δ(p′ − p) + 1

2 δ(p′ − q) with q = 1 − p.

This mixing function corresponds to the long-range Ising model with Z2 symmetry and ρ > 0. Xij are given as

This is the modiﬁed version of the above solution with a parameter k = 0, 1, · · · . If we set k = 0, it is nothing

If we denote C1 = pk

solution may look trivial. One obtain this solution using the parallel shift of the above solution (46). We replace
Xij with Xi+kj in eq.(46) and obtain the solution. Such a parallel shift may give birth to another solution, we
would like to note it here.

• f (p′) = (1 − α)δ(p′ − p′′) + αδ(p′ − 1).

This mixing function corresponds to the long-range Ising model without Z2 symmetry, < Si >≃ 1 and ρ > 0.
We call the model as Binomial plus (B+) model, because it is a binomial distribution plus one small peak at
n = N . Between p, ρ and p′′, α, we have the relations

In this subsection, we study the relations between probability distributions and correlation structure. Figure 4
shows the probability distribution proﬁles for three correlated models, MCB, BBD and Two-Binomial models. We set
p = 0.5, ρ = 0.3 and N = 30. We also shows the pure binomial distribution for comparison. The former three curves
have the same p and ρ, however their proﬁles are drastically diﬀerent. Two binomial model with Z2 symmetry has
two peaks and their overlaps decreases as N increases. At the thermodynamic limit N → ∞, the overlap disappears
and the system loses its ergodicity. The long-range Ising models shows spontaneous symmetry (SSB) breaking of
the Z2 symmetry . On the other hand, the BBD’s proﬁle is broad and even if we set N → ∞, we obtain the beta
distribution and the shape is almost unchanged. That is, the BBD system does not show SSB and it maintain its Z2
(particle-hole) symmetry at p = 0.5.

The proﬁle of MCB model is peculiar. It is not symmetric and shows singular rippling. The origin for the ripping
can be understood from the inspection of its correlation structure. Figure 5 shows the correlation structures for the
above three models. The parameters are equal and we show ρi30−i. In contrast to the BBD’s correlation, which is
constant with i + j ﬁxed, the correlations for MCB has sharp peak at i = 30 and show strong rippling structure. The
curve is not symmetric and the distortion is reﬂected in the shape of its probability distribution. On the other hand,
the correlation curve for Two-binomial distribution has a strong peak at i = N
2 and is it much diﬀerent from the
BBD’s correlation curve. This strong peak and rapid decay may be reﬂected in the decomposition of the probability
distribution. However, we have not yet understood the relation well.

Figure 6 shows the probability distribution for MCB, BBD and B+ models. We set p = 0.1, ρ = 0.3 and N = 30.
We also shows the pure binomial distribution for comparison. MCB and BBD have almost the same bulk shape,
however MCB has a small peak at n = 30. B+ has more strong peak at n = 30 and its bulk shape can be obtained by
a small left shift of the pure binomial distribution p = 0.1. These proﬁle diﬀerences are reﬂected in their correlation
structures. See Figure 7. It shows the correlation structures for the above three models. The parameters are equal as
in the previous ﬁgure. Contrary to the constant BBD structure, MCB and B+ models have a peak at i = 30. MCB
has a small and B+ has a tall peak and the diﬀerence is reﬂected int the size of their tail peak of the probability
distributions.

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE PROBLEMS

In this paper, we show a general method to construct correlated binomial models. We also estimate their moments.
Our method includes Witt’s model and the BBD. In addition, with the consistent equations on pij and ρij , it is possible
to prepare correlated binomial distributions with any choice for ρi0 or pi0. Of course, the resulting distribution function
should be non-negative , ’any’ should be taken with some care. In addition, from the joint probabilities Xij, it is
possible to estimate pij and ρij. We can see the detailed structure of the system with any distribution function. In the
work [4], the conditional strange failure probabilities pi0 were studied. Some recursive relations on pi0 were proposed
and the resulting conditional probabilities pi0 were compared with real data on server networks. We note that pi0 can
be freely changed and it may be possible to make a good ﬁtting with data. However, if the correlation structure ρij
becomes too complex and it shows oscillation, such a modeling may be over-ﬁtting.

At last, we make comments about future problems. The ﬁrst one is to seek another interesting solution to eq.(29),
eq.(30) and eq.(31) about ρij and pij. In this paper, we have assumed strong symmetry in ρij in the derivation of

12

the BBD. For any value of p, we have assumed Z2 symmetry ρij = ρji. Furthermore, we have assumed stronger
constraint that ρij depends on i, j only through the combination i + j. The consistent relation is then solved easily
and we get the BBD. However, we think that the correlated binomial distribution space is rich and there may exist
other interesting solutions. We discuss some simple solutions which are superpositions of two binomial distribution.
They try to mimic the long-range Ising model in the large N limit and ρ > 0 [9]. A simple seamless solution for
the consistent relations which correspond to the long-range Ising model may exist. Taking the continuous limit of
the consistent relations and studying their solution is also an interesting problem. The solution space may become
narrow, however diﬀerential equations are more tractable than the recursion relations. There should exist the beta
distribution and the superposition of delta-functions, which are the continuous limits of the simple solutions presented
here.

The second problem is the generalization of the present method. In this paper, we have assumed that the Bernoulli
random variables are all exchangeable. If one consider to apply the correlated binomial model to the real world, such
an idealization should be relaxed. One possibility is the inhomogeneity in p and the other is the inhomogeneity in ρ.
The ﬁrst step is to add one other Bernoulli random variable Y to N exchangeable variable system. This N + 1 system
case has been treated in [8], it seems much diﬃcult to introduce the self-consistent equations in the present context.
However, such a generalization may lead us to ﬁnd new probability distribution functions, we believe that it deserves
for extensive studies.

Abstract

For the analysis of surface height proﬁles we present a new stochastic
approach which is based on the theory of Markov processes. With this
analysis we achieve a characterization of the complexity of the surface
roughness by means of a Fokker-Planck or Langevin equation, providing
the complete stochastic information of multiscale joint probabilities. The
method was applied to diﬀerent road surface proﬁles which were measured
with high resolution. Evidence of Markov properties is shown. Estima-
tions for the parameters of the Fokker-Planck equation are based on pure,
parameter free data analysis.

1 Introduction

The complexity of the topography of rough surfaces is commonly investigated
by methods of multifractality and multiaﬃnity to characterize their scale de-
pendent disorder. The f (α) spectrum has been regarded as the most complete
characterization of a surface, cf. [1–4]. From a stochastic point of view one has
to remark that multifractality and multiaﬃnity are based on properties of the
roughness on distinct length scales. This does not include possible correlations
of the roughness measures on diﬀerent scales. Moreover, methods based on mul-
tifractality and multiaﬃnity are limited to the subclass of rough surfaces which
show scaling properties.

In this letter we want to focus specially on the applied problem of character-
izing road surfaces. A collection of road surface data was measured. These data
served previously as an empirical basis for the prediction of vibrational stress
on bicycle riders [5]. It is common to describe the quality of a road surface by
a power law ﬁt to the power spectrum of the height proﬁle [6–8]. This method
is not appropriate especially for wavelengths below 0.3 m and for non-Gaussian
height distributions. Some improvements to this method have been proposed
to compensate for the non-stationary and non-Gaussian nature of road proﬁles.

Therefore the data were divided into sections to achieve more Gaussian-like
statistics [9]. Nevertheless the characterization of road surfaces still remains
incomplete [10, 11]. This becomes even more important for vehicles at lower
speeds like inner city traﬃc, vehicles with low energy consumption, and bicy-
cles. For the improvement of road surface characterization multifractality and
multiaﬃnity seem not to be an appropriate tool because scaling is no constant
feature of road surfaces.

The method we are proposing in this contribution is based on stochastic
processes which should grasp the scale dependency of surface roughness in a
most general way. Furthermore no scaling feature is explicitly required. To this
end we present a systematic procedure how the explicit form of a stochastic
process can be extracted by pure data analysis. It should be noted that this
stochastic approach has turned out to be a promising tool also for other systems
with scale dependent complexity like turbulence [12,13], ﬁnancial data [14], and
others [15].

2 Method

It is one common procedure to characterize the complexity of a rough surface
by the statistics of the height increment

hr(x) := h(x + r) − h(x)

(1)

depending on the length scale r, as marked in ﬁg. 1. Other scale dependent
roughness measures can, for example, be found in [2, 4]. Here we use the height
increment hr because it is also directly linked to vehicle vibrations induced by
the road surface if r is the wheelbase. As a new ansatz, hr will be regarded here
as a stochastic variable in r. We consider the process as being directed from
larger to smaller scales. Our interest is the investigation how surface roughness
is linked between diﬀerent length scales.

Complete information about the stochastic process would be available by the
knowledge of all possible n-point, or more precisely n-scale, probability density
functions (pdf) p(h1, r1; h2, r2; . . . ; hn, rn) describing the probability of ﬁnding
simultaneously the increments h1 on the scale r1, h2 on the scale r2, and so
forth up to hn on the scale rn. Here we use the notation hi = hri(x), see (1).
Without loss of generality we take r1 < r2 < . . . < rn. As a ﬁrst question for
this general ansatz, one has to ask for a suitable simpliﬁcation. In any case the
n-scale joint pdf can be expressed by multiconditional pdf

p(h1, r1; . . . ; hn, rn) = p(h1, r1|h2, r2; . . . ; hn, rn) · p(h2, r2|h3, r3; . . . ; hn, rn)
(2)

· . . . · p(hn−1, rn−1|hn, rn) · p(hn, rn)

where p(hi, ri|hj, rj) denotes a conditional probability, e.g. the probability of
ﬁnding the increment hi on the scale ri under the condition that simultaneously
on a larger scale rj the value hj was found. An important simpliﬁcation arises
if

p(hi, ri|hi+1, ri+1; . . . ; hn, rn) = p(hi, ri|hi+1, ri+1) .

(3)

2

This property is the deﬁning feature of a Markov process evolving from ri+1 to
ri. Thus for a Markov process the n-scale joint pdf factorize into n conditional
pdf

p(h1, r1; . . . ; hn, rn) = p(h1, r1 |h2, r2) · . . . · p(hn−1, rn−1 |hn, rn) · p(hn, rn) . (4)

This Markov property implies that the r–dependence of hr can be regarded as
a stochastic process evolving in r, driven by deterministic and random forces.
If additionally the included noise is Gaussian distributed, the process can be
described by a Fokker-Planck equation [16]. For our height proﬁles it takes the
form

− r

p(hr, r|h0, r0) =

D(1)(hr, r) +

D(2)(hr, r)

p(hr, r|h0, r0) .

(5)
The Fokker-Planck equation then describes the evolution of the conditional
probability density function from larger to smaller length scales and thus also
the complete n–scale statistics. The minus sign on the left side of eq. (5) ex-
presses this direction of the process, furthermore the factor r corresponds to
a logarithmic variable ρ = ln r which leads to simpliﬁed results in the case of
scaling behaviour.

The term D(1)(hr, r) is commonly denoted as drift term, describing the
deterministic part of the process, and D(2)(hr, r) as diﬀusion term being the
variance of a Gaussian, δ-correlated noise. Focus of our analysis is to show
evidence of the above mentioned Markov property and to derive the drift and
diﬀusion coeﬃcients D(1) and D(2) in eq. (5) from experimental data.

such a way that stationarity is given. Proﬁle length is typically 20 m or 19 000
samples, respectively. Longitudinal resolution was 1.04 mm and vertical error
smaller than 0.5 mm. As an example we present results from a data set of a
smooth asphalt road consisting of ten proﬁles with a total of about 190 000
samples [17]. Similar results are obtained from other data sets [18]. Figure 1
shows a short section of the data. In ﬁg. 2 the power spectral density of the
height proﬁles is plotted against the wavenumber. There is no clear evidence
for scaling behaviour. In the following, the height increments are normalized by
ri1/2, with σ∞ = 0.7 mm for the given data set.
σ∞ := limr→∞hh2

4 Markov Properties

For a Markov process the deﬁning feature is that the n-point conditional proba-
bility distributions are equal to the single conditional probabilities, according to
eq. (3). With the given amount of data points the veriﬁcation of this condition
is only possible for n = 3 and for r1 < r2 < r3 < 200 mm:

p(h1, r1|h2, r2) ?= p(h1, r1|h2, r2; h3, r3).

(6)

The scales r1, r2, r3 are again nested into each other according to the direction
of the process.

Figure 3 shows both sides of eq. (6) in a contour plot and two cuts at
h2 = ±σ∞. The value of h3 was chosen to be h3 = 0. We take this rather
good correspondence as a strong hint for a Markov process. Note that the main
axis of the distribution is tilted indicating that p(h1, r1|h2, r2) 6= p(h1, r1) and
thus height increments on diﬀerent scales are not independent.

5 Estimation and Veriﬁcation of Drift and Dif-

fusion Coeﬃcients

In order to obtain the drift (D(1)) and diﬀusion coeﬃcient (D(2)) for eq. (5) we
proceed in a well deﬁned way like it was already expressed by Kolmogorov [19],
see also [12, 16]. First, the conditional moments M (k)(hr, r, ∆r) for ﬁnite step
sizes ∆r are directly estimated from the data

M (k)(hr, r, ∆r) =

(˜h − hr)k p(˜h, r − ∆r|hr, r) d˜h .

Second, the coeﬃcients D(k)(hr, r) are obtained from the M (k) when ∆r ap-
proaches zero

D(k)(hr, r) := lim

M (k)(hr, r, ∆r) .

(8)

Figure 4 shows estimations of the drift coeﬃcient D(1) and the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient D(2) for r = 104 mm. The error bars are estimated from the number
of events contributing to each value. The limit ∆r → 0 was performed in
both cases by ﬁtting a straight line to M (k)(hr, r, ∆r) in the range 2 mm ≤

shows an oﬀset and a parabolic shape indicating the presence of multiplicative

noise. It is easy to verify that with linear D(1) and constant D(2) the Fokker-
Planck equation (5) describes a Gaussian process, while with a parabolic D(2)
the distributions become non-Gaussian, also called intermittent or heavy tailed.
In our case, here, D(1)(hr, r) is best approximated by a linear function in
hr with small oﬀset and quadratic correction as D(1)(hr, r) = a0(r) + a1(r)hr +
a2(r)h2
r where a0(r) = 0.0113r, a1(r) = −0.130r, and a2(r) = −0.00654r.
D(2)(hr, r) was found to be well ﬁtted by a quadratic function D(2)(hr, r) =
b0(r)+b1(r)hr +b2(r)h2
r with the values b0(r) = 0.124r, b1(r) = 0.139+0.00553r,
and b2(r) = 0.244 + 0.00969r. [20]

Equation (5) can be integrated over h0 and is then valid also for the uncon-

ditioned pdfs of hr

For the veriﬁcation of the estimated coeﬃcients D(1) and D(2) the empirical
pdf at r0 = 188 mm is parameterized (see ﬁg. 5) and used as initial condition
for a numerical solution of eq. (9). For several values of r the reconstructed pdf
is compared to the respective empirical pdf, as shown in ﬁg. 5.

6 Conclusions

The height increment hr of surface height proﬁles as a stochastic variable in
r can be correctly described by a Fokker-Planck equation with drift and diﬀu-
sion coeﬃcients derived directly from measured data. The results of the pre-
sented example support the hypothesis that the noise term in the evolution
of the stochastic variable hr in r is suﬃciently well described by a Gaussian,
δ-correlated random process.

As the Fokker-Planck equation describes the evolution of p(hr, r | h0, r0) and
p(hr, r) with r, it covers also the behaviour of the moments hhn

knowledge of the Fokker-Planck equation provides more information on the com-

density functions, which correspond to multipoint statistics.

At last we want to point out that the Fokker-Planck equation (5) corresponds

to the following Langevin equation (we use Itˆo’s deﬁnition) [16]

model in the scale variable should open the possibility to directly simulate sur-
face proﬁles with given stochastic properties for applications in e.g. vehicle en-
gineering and geophysics.

no principal drawback of the proposed analysis.

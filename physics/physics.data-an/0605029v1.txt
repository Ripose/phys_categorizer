Detecting degree symmetries in networks

The surrounding of a vertex in a network can be more or less symmetric. We derive measures of a speciﬁc kind
of symmetry of a vertex which we call degree symmetry—the property that many paths going out from a vertex
have overlapping degree sequences. These measures are evaluated on artiﬁcial and real networks. Speciﬁcally
we consider vertices in the human metabolic network. We also measure the average degree-symmetry coeﬃcient
for diﬀerent classes of real-world network. We ﬁnd that most studied examples are weakly positively degree-
symmetric. The exceptions are an airport network (having a negative degree-symmetry coeﬃcient) and one-mode
projections of social aﬃliation networks that are rather strongly degree-symmetric.

I. INTRODUCTION

With the advent of modern database technology numerous
large scale network data-sets have been made available. This
development has triggered a surge of activity in studies of sta-
tistical network properties (1; 5; 21). The underlying idea
of these studies is that the network structure (the way the net-
works diﬀer from completely random networks) contain some
information of the function, both locally and globally, of the
network. Hence a common theme in these works has been the
development of structural measures to characterize network
structure. In this paper we propose and evaluate a measure
of a previously unstudied network structure—a special case
of symmetry we call degree symmetry. In geometry an object
is symmetrical if it is invariant to rotations, reﬂections, and
so on.
In networks, with no given geometrical embedding,
these concepts have to be relaxed. Furthermore, we would
like to have a continuous measure saying not only if a vertex
is a local center of symmetry or not, but also how symmetric
the vertex is. The aspect of symmetry we address is, roughly
speaking, that if you look at the object (network in our case)
in diﬀerent ways from a symmetric vertex it still looks the
same. We process of “looking” will in our case be walking
along paths (non-self intersecting sequences of edges). Fur-
thermore, since degree (number of neighbors) is commonly
regarded as the most fundamental quantity relating a vertex to
its function, we say two vertices “look the same” if they have

the same degree. We will thus derive our measure by perform-
ing walks along all paths from a vertex and compare the se-
quence of degrees of the vertices along these paths. The situa-
tion we have in mind is depicted in Fig. 1—all paths from the
central vertex have degree sequences starting with (3, 2, · · · ),
thus the central vertex is highly degree symmetric.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: First we give a
detailed derivation of the degree-symmetry coeﬃcient (in two
diﬀerent versions, appropriate for diﬀerent needs). Then we
evaluate these on example networks and a biochemical net-
work. Finally we discuss the average degree symmetry of dif-
ferent classes of real-world networks.

II. DERIVATION OF THE MEASURE

We will consider the network represented by a graph G =
(V, E) of N vertices, V, and M edges, E. For a vertex i to
have high degree symmetry it has, as mentioned, to have many
paths with the same sequence of degrees. We will use a cut-oﬀ
l for the pathlength and consider only paths of that length. The
reason for this cutoﬀ is threefold: First, in all (with possibly
some curious exception) network processes, a vertex is more
aﬀected by its closest surroundings then vertices further away.
Thus one would like to have a lower weight on the contribu-
tion from distant vertices. Second, the number of vertices n
steps away grows fast with the distance from i. For ﬁnite net-
works this means that the paths soon reach the periphery of
the network where unwanted ﬁnite-size eﬀects set in. Third,
for computation speed, one beneﬁt from a cutoﬀ.

Assume there are p paths of length l from a vertex i. We

then denote the degree sequences of these paths

Ql(i) =

[k(v1

1,i,l), · · · , k(vl

1,i,l)],

would thus be to count the fraction of index-pairs with the

This measure is very crude and lack many desired statistical
features. For example, all paths that go via a particular neigh-
bor of i will give a contribution to the sum. In practice this
means that vertices with a high degree vertex rather far from
itself (but closer that l) will trivially have a high ˜sl(i)/Λ. A
ﬁrst step would thus be to omit the contribution of vertices oc-
curring in many sequences of Ql(i) at a speciﬁc index. I.e., for
all l′ ∈ (0, l) one wants to exclude the terms

where n and n′ are indices of paths that are identical the ﬁrst l′
steps, from Eq. (2). Let S l(i) denote the number of such terms.
To calculate S l(i) consider a path P = (i, · · · , j) of length
l′ < l. Let bl(P, i) be the number of paths from i of length l that
start with the path P. We call bl(P, i) the branching number of
P, see Fig. 2(a). All pairs of paths starting with P will con-
tribute to ˜sl(i) a distance l′ from i (since they all pass through
j). Let ∆(P, i) be the set of neighbors to j that is not on the
path P from i to j, see Fig. 2(b). (The number of elements in
∆(P, i) is thus k j − 1.) This situation gives a contribution

coeﬃcient sl(i) that is zero when the symmetry is what can
be expected from the null-model, larger if i is a center of un-
expectedly high symmetry, and less than zero if i is degree
anti-symmetric. A ﬁnal symmetry coeﬃcient could thus be
written

sl(i) =

˜sl(i) − S l(i)
Λ − S l(i)

− ν, provided Λ > S l(i)

(6)

where ν is the expected value of ( ˜sl(i) − S l(i))/(Λ − S l(i)) in
a null-model. Λ = S l(i) can only happen if there is one or no
path of length l. In both these cases the degree-symmetry con-
cept makes no sense so, if Λ = S l(i) ∈ {0, 1}, we set sl(i) = 0.
The null-model we assume is random constrained on the de-
gree distribution of the network. I.e., given the fraction pk of
k-degree vertices the network is as random as possible. As it
turns out ν is tricky to calculate analytically. There are two
ways to proceed—either one calculates an approximative ν or
one obtains ν via averaging ( ˜sl(i) − S l(i))/(Λ − S l(i)) over re-
alizations of the null-model. Except being more accurate, the
latter approach has the advantage of giving an error estimate
of sl(i)—one can by specifying a p-value deﬁne signiﬁcantly
symmetric, or anti-symmetric, vertices. We will use both ap-
proaches: The approximative method for analyzing example
networks and the numerical method for analyzing real-world
data.

We obtain an approximative value of ν, νapp., by assuming ν
is approximately equal to the probability that a pair of vertices,
reached by walking along paths, is the same. Note that, since
there are k ways into a degree-k vertex, when following a path
the probability to reach a degree-k vertex is

Thus the probability νapp. that two vertices of the same degree
is reached by following diﬀerent paths is

One reason this approach is not exact is that the number of
terms in the expression for ˜sl(i) increases with the degree of
the j in ∆(P, i) of Eq. (5). There are other higher-order eﬀects
to related to other correlations between the path structure and
the degree of the vertices.

To summarize we have two measures of local vertex sym-

metry, one approximative:

and one based one Monte Carlo sampling

from vertices of indices in the interval [l′, l] of Ql(i) to ˜sl(i),
where (P, j′) denotes the path (i, · · · , j, j′).

To further improve the measure one would like to, assuming
some null-model, subtract the expected random contribution
to ˜sl(i)/Λ. If this can be achieved one would have a symmetry

˜sl(i) − S l(i)

The sampling is conveniently done by random rewiring the
edges of the original network (24).

III. ALGORITHM

The heart of algorithm, as suggested in the previous section,
is a depth-ﬁrst search with depth l. When the returning along
the traced out paths the branching number can be calculated
recursively through

bl(P, i) =

(

1

P

j′∈∆((P, j′),i) bl((P, j′), i) otherwise

if P has length l

. (11)

S l(Pi) can be calculated simultaneously using Eq. (5). A slight
complication is that the same vertex may appear in diﬀerent
branches of the depth ﬁrst search while calculating b and ˜s.
For small cut-oﬀ values this is easy to handle: For l = 2 it
does not aﬀect the calculation at all. For l = 3 one would
only have to keep diﬀerent depths (of Eqs. (5) and (11)) sep-
arate. For the calculation of ˜sl(i) the terms of Ql(i) has to be
stored. Since the number of paths p grows fast with l, this
can be quite a constraint for a large l. Luckily it suﬃces to
store a histogram h(l′, k) counting the number of vertices of
degree k at position l′ of the paths Ql(i). p (and thus Λ) can be
calculated as the number of time the depth l of the depth ﬁrst
search is reached. The running time of the algorithm is O(p).
A mean ﬁeld approximation for networks with few triangles
gives O(p) ≈ O(hkil).

IV. EXTENSIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS

The method outlined above can quite straightforwardly be
extended to network with directed edges, distinct types of
edges or (integer) edge weights.

Imagine a network with z diﬀerent edge sets E1, · · · , Ez.
Such networks frequently occur in cellular biochemistry—e.g.
protein interaction networks where diﬀerent types of protein
interaction can be recorded (11), or gene regulation networks
where the edges can be activating or inhibitory. One sensible
way to extend the above procedure is to use the union of the
edges as your graph but to say two pairs of vertices in Ql(i) are
identical if their degrees with respect to all of the networks are
the same. To formalize this Ql(i) would be generalized to

Ql(i) =

[k(v1

1,i,l), · · · , k(vl

1,i,l)],

n
...
, [k(v1

p,i,l), · · · , k(vl

p,i,l)]

,
o

where k(v) is a vector with v’s degrees with respect to the
diﬀerent edge-types. and the δ-function of Eq. (4) would be
one if the arguments are equal at all their indices, and zero
otherwise. The νapp. has to be redeﬁned too:

treated similarly—one consider paths following edges in both
directions but a vertex pair gives a contribution to ˜s only if
both the in- and out-degrees are the same.

The approach of Sect. III can straightforwardly be applied
to networks where multiple edges are allowed. Since multiple
edges can be used to model weighted graphs (22) the general-
ization to weighted graphs (at least where edge-weights repre-
sent the probability of following an edge) is simple. The other
aspect of multigraphs, self-edges, is trivially dealt with—by
the requirement that a paths should not intersect themselves
a self-edge will never be followed and can thus be omitted
already when the graph is constructed.

The overlap required for a vertex pair to be considered
equal in the calculation of the symmetry coeﬃcient is rather
strict. Sometimes one would like to treat two paths as similar
even if their degrees diﬀers slightly. Particularly, this applies
to broad degree distributions. The functional diﬀerence be-
tween degree-2 and degree-3 vertices may be signiﬁcant; but
whether a vertex has degree 1002 or 1003 probably does not
matter. To achieve such a relaxation one can construct a inte-
ger sequence K1 < K2 < · · · and let

δ(k, k′) =

(

1 if Ki ≤ k, k′ < Ki+1 for some i
0 otherwise

.

(14)

I.e., one construct a series of equivalence classes of vertices.
For a power-law, or similarly broad, degree distributions one
can let Ki+1 − Ki increase exponentially with i. In this case one
also has to modify the deﬁnition of νapp.

where pi(k|k′) is the conditional probability that a vertex has
degree k with respect to edge set Ei given that its degree in the
union network is k′. The case of a directed network can be

In this section we evaluate the measure for example net-
works and real-world networks. We will use the smallest non-
trivial cut-oﬀ l = 2 throughout this section. Most conclusions
hold for l = 3 or 4.

A. Small test graphs

To get a feeling for the sl measure we start by considering
a few small test networks, see Fig. 3.
In Fig. 3(a) we dis-
play a network with the same degree symmetry, with respect
to the central vertex (triangle), as Fig. 1. As expected the cen-
tral vertex has a strong degree symmetry coeﬃcient. To carry
through the calculation of Eq. (9) once we obtain the degree
distribution p2 = 8/13, p3 = 4/13 and p4 = 1/13 giving
νapp. = 165/832 ≈ 0.198. All length-2 paths out from the
central vertex have the degree sequence (3, 2) so ˜s2(△) = 4,
S 2(△) = 4 and Λ = 28 giving sapp.
(△) = 667/832 ≈ 0.802.
The degree-3 vertices (squares) have two degree sequences
of their outgoing paths (4, 3) and (2, 2), whereas paths from
degree-2 vertices (triangles) have degree sequences (3, 4) and
(2, 3). This diﬀerence is larger than expected from the null
model (random networks with eight degree-2 vertices, four
degree-3 vertices and one degree-4 vertex), thus the negative
s2 values for these vertices.

2

In Fig. 3(b) we show a graph where all vertices have pos-
itive degree-symmetry coeﬃcient. Paths from degree-2 ver-
tices have only the degree sequence (3, 2) and paths from
degree-3 vertices have only the degree sequence (2, 3). Thus,
for every vertex, the view of degrees along the path out to the
rest of the network is the same no matter which direction one
looks in from that vertex. A radically diﬀerent view is seen in
Fig. 3(c). In this case the vertices have three distinct positions
in the network. The vertices marked with squares have degree
two and four outgoing paths of degree sequences (2, 4), (4, 4),
(4, 2) and (4, 2). The circles, despite their diﬀerent network
position (as being part of triangles), have the same set of de-
gree sequences for their paths of length two. The degree-3
vertices have six length-2 paths: three having the degree se-
quence (2, 2), three having degree sequence (4, 2). It is easy
to convince oneself that this close to as dissimilar a network
with four degree-2 and two degree-4 vertices can be. Conse-
quently all vertices have negative degree-symmetry indices. It
is worth pointing out that the Fig. 3(c) possesses other sym-
metries than degree-symmetry. The layout has, for example,
reﬂexive symmetry along a vertical axis. We emphasize that
such symmetries would need to be captured by other mea-
sures.

C. Random graphs

Next we evaluate the average approximative symmetry co-
eﬃcient hsapp.i for random graphs (14)—graphs obtained by
successively adding M edges between N vertices with the re-
striction that no multiple edge, or self-edge, may occur. Such
networks have no correlations at all and can serve as a ref-
erence point for neutrality (21). Ideally we would like such
networks to, on average, have a degree-symmetry coeﬃcient
of zero. As seen in Fig. 4 hsapp.
i converge to a small but posi-
tive value. The decay is roughly inversely proportional to N—
the same scaling as the fraction of triangles in the network—
which suggests that the presence of triangles, and perhaps
other short-cycles, is an important source of ﬁnite size eﬀects
of sapp.
. We conclude that the Monte Carlo sampling measure
l
sMC
(or a more elaborate measure) is needed if one wants to
l
compare diﬀerent networks. If, on the other hand, one aims
to compare diﬀerent vertices of the same network the faster
sapp.
(i) calculation is suﬃcient. This is not an uncommon situ-
l
ation in the design of network measures. Another example of
this where neutrality is non-zero in the large-N limit is modu-
larity, measuring how good a subgraphs that are densely con-
nected within but not between each other (8).

VI. DEGREE SYMMETRIES OF REAL NETWORKS

In this section we apply our measures to real-world net-
works. First we take a look at the symmetry coeﬃcients of
speciﬁc vertices in the metabolic network of humans, then we
look at the average symmetry coeﬃcients of various classes
of networks.

B. Regular networks

A. Human metabolic networks

If all vertices have the same degree a network is called reg-
ular (14). Then by deﬁnition all paths are known to fully
overlap. This trivial overlap should be canceled in our sym-
metry measure so sl(i) = 0 for all l and i. Since S l(i) is the
number of terms in ˜sl(i) and all these terms are one we have
S l(i) = ˜sl(i) = Λ. Furthermore, νapp. = 1 which gives sl(i) for
all vertices and cut-oﬀ lengths.

An important use of statistical graph theory is to charac-
terize chemical reaction networks. Of many possible network
representations (29) we let vertices be chemical substances,
and for all reactions of an organism we link substrates with
products. For example, the hypothetical reaction A + B ←→
C + D would contribute with the edges (A, C), (A, D) and
(B, C), (B, D) to the metabolic network. The data is derived

1,4-L-fucosyl)-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-R, C04556 represents 4-
amino-2-methyl-5-phosphomethylpyrimidine, C04467 represents α-
L-fucosyl-1,2-β-D-galactosyl-R and C01311 represents 1,4-β-D-

from the KEGG database (http://www.genome.jp/), and
described in detail in Ref. (13). Since the degree distributions
of metabolic networks are highly skewed (16) we use a expo-
nentially increasing set of intervals as equivalence classes (as
discussed in the connect of Eq. (14)): Kn = 2n.

It has been argued that degree is strongly related to the func-
tion of the chemical substance (7; 16). This means that the
degree symmetry potentially can give additional information
about the function of the vertices. For the human metabolic
network, and l = 2, roughly half of the vertices have a p-value
of less than 5% (i.e., in the null-model sampling of the calcu-
lation of sMC
, less than 5% or more than 95% of the values of

2

˜sl(i) − S l(i)
Λ − S l(i)

(16)

are smaller than the value of the real network). In Fig. 5(a)
we show the 2-neighborhood of one vertex with signiﬁ-
cantly higher sMC
than expected; Fig. 5(b) depict the 2-
neighborhood of a vertex with signiﬁcantly higher sMC
. The
reason these particular vertices are used as examples is that

2

2

their 2-neighborhoods are of appropriate sizes, neither too
big, nor too small, to be displayed and described. Sper-
mine, Fig. 5(a), is a substance with high degree-symmetry—
sMC
2 = 0.89 ± 0.02. Both its neighbors are in the same degree-
equivalence class of vertices with degree four to seven. Of ver-
tices two steps away from spermine there is also a signiﬁcant
overlap with two (out of four) neighbors to the neighbor sper-
midine being in the equivalence class deﬁned by degrees in the
interval [8, 16); whereas two vertices are in the equivalence
class of degrees in [4, 8). The three paths from spermine via S-
adenosylmethioninamine also contribute to the overlap in the
two steps from spermine as two vertices (methylthioadenosine
and spermindine) have degrees in the same equivalence class.
The neighborhood of C04850, seen in Fig. 5(b), is visually
less balanced and also having a negative degree-symmetry—
sMC
2 = −0.11 ± 0.01. We note that there are some vertex pairs
in the second neighborhood whose degree-classes overlap, but
apparently this is not enough to make the symmetry coeﬃcient
non-negative.

B. Average symmetry values

So far we have discussed degree symmetries of vertices. In
this section we average sl over V to obtain a graph-wide mea-
sure for degree symmetry.
In Table I we display values of
sMC
for a number of diﬀerent network types. Some of these
2
have highly skewed degree distributions. For these, the expo-
nentially increasing degree equivalence classes of Sect. VI.A
are appropriate. Since we intend to compare all networks we
use the same equivalence classes for all networks. The ﬁrst
observation is that almost all networks have a positive aver-
age symmetry coeﬃcient. The only clear exception is the
airport network. This means that if you start a two-leg air-
plane trip at a particular airport, choosing between two ran-
dom itineraries (without caring about the frequency of ﬂights),
then the probability of the airports along these itineraries be-
ing diﬀerent in number of connections is smaller than in a ran-
dom network. The strongest degree-symmetries are found in
one-mode projections of social aﬃliation networks. Note that
the other social networks, derived from questionnaires and
electronic communication does not have such strong symme-
try coeﬃcients. In one-mode projections high-degree vertices
are known to have strong tendency to attach to other high-
degree vertices, and low-degree vertices to attach to other
If
low-degree-vertices—so called assortative mixing (20).
this property is strong there will be regions of vertices with
high degree and other regions with low-degree vertices. The
paths within these regions would also have similar degree se-
quences. Thus high assortative mixing can be related to high
degree symmetry, the ﬁrst causing the second or vice versa.
They are, of course, not equivalent—e.g., the example net-
work with all vertices having positive symmetry coeﬃcients
(Fig. 3(b)) is maximally disassortatively mixed (in the sense
of Ref. (20)). Where the weak symmetry coeﬃcients of other
networks come from is outside the scope of this investigation.
One possible explanation would be that functional units (26)
might often be degree-symmetric centers.

of real-world networks. In the interstate
network the vertices are American interstate highway junctions and two junctions are connected if there is a road with no junction in between.
In the street networks the vertices are Swedish city-street segments connected if they share a junction. In the airport network (obtained from
http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/pajek/data/gphs.htm) the vertices are American airports and edges represent a regular, non-stop route.
In the citation networks the vertices are papers and two papers are connected if they one cites the other. The “scientometrics” network consists
of papers from the journal Scientometrics. The “small-world” network are all papers citing Ref. (19) or having the phrase “small world” in the
title. (The citation networks were obtained from http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/data/cite/. These networks are the result of searches in
the WebofScience used with the permission of ISI Philadelphia.) The board of directors and Ajou student networks are derived from one-mode
projections of aﬃliation networks (where edges goes from persons to corporate boards and university classes respectively). The Ajou student
network is averaged over graphs of 16 semesters. One edge represent two students taking at least three classes together that semester. The high
school networks are gathered from questionnaires—an edge means that two persons have listed each other as acquaintances. It is averaged over
84 individual schools. In the electronic communication networks one edge represent that at least one of the vertices has contacted the other
over some electronic medium. The food webs are networks of water-living species and an edge means that one species prey on the other. For
the protein networks an edge means that two proteins interact (the two graphs correspond to two diﬀerent types of experiments determining
the interaction edges). The metabolic networks consist of chemical substances and edges are constructed as described in Sect. VI.A. Values
for animal metabolism is averaged over six networks, fungi metabolism is averaged over two, and bacteria metabolism is averaged over 96
networks.

VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have derived a measure for a speciﬁc notion of symme-
try in networks—the property that the paths out from a vertex
have overlapping degree sequences. The measure is designed
so that random networks, conditioned only to have the same
set of degrees as the original network, have the value zero.
We propose two versions of the symmetry coeﬃcient, the ﬁrst
being approximately zero for random networks, the second
requiring a randomization procedure (and thus longer simu-
lation time) but being more accurately zero for random net-
works. The measure was evaluated on example graphs. We
show that they are able to detect vertices in degree-symmetric,
and potentially functionally meaningful positions in the hu-
man metabolic network. The average degree-symmetry of
various networks were also investigated. We found almost
all networks having a weakly positive degree coeﬃcient. The
exceptions being the network of American airports and their
interconnections (having a negative degree-symmetry coeﬃ-

cient) and one-mode projections of social aﬃliation networks
(having rather strongly positive values). Our measure is not
the ﬁrst to be based on a the properties of paths going out
from a vertex. For example people have been using path
counts for assessing the functional similarity of pairs of ver-
tices (3; 15; 17). In social network studies such measures are
commonly called “ego-centric” (27).

Symmetry concepts have been successfully utilized in
many ﬁeld of physics. We believe degree symmetry, and other
classes of network symmetries, will be a fruitful direction
of future network studies. Degree symmetry is in particular,
we believe, an important concept for networks where degree
is strongly related to the function of the vertex. Two open
questions from this study is what causes the rather ubiquitous
weakly positive degree symmetries, and what process in the
airline decision making that causes the negative average sym-
metry coeﬃcient of the airline network.

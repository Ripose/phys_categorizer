Optimal Proton Trapping

(Dated: February 21, 2014)

In a neutron lifetime experiment conducted at the National Institute of Standards and Technology,
protons produced by neutron decay events are conﬁned in a Penning trap.
In each run of the
experiment, there is a trapping stage of duration τ . After the trapping stage, protons are purged from
the trap. A proton detector provides incomplete information because it goes dead after detecting the
ﬁrst of any purged protons. Further, there is a dead time δ between the end of the trapping stage in
one run and the beginning of the next trapping stage in the next run. Based on the fraction of runs
where a proton is detected, I estimate the trapping rate λ by the method of maximum likelihood. I
show that the expected value of the maximum likelihood estimate is inﬁnite. To obtain a maximum
likelihood estimate with a ﬁnite expected value and a well-deﬁned and ﬁnite variance, I restrict
attention to a subsample of all realizations of the data. This subsample excludes an exceedingly
rare realization that yields an inﬁnite-valued estimate of λ. I present asymptotically valid formulas
for the bias, root-mean-square prediction error, and standard deviation of the maximum likelihood
estimate of λ for this subsample. Based on nominal values of λ and the dead time δ, I determine
the optimal duration of the trapping stage τ by minimizing the root-mean-square prediction error
of the estimate.

INTRODUCTION

rate were determined by a Bayesian scheme.

Ion traps play a key role in fundamental physics ex-
periments (Ref. [1]). In this paper, I focus on statistical
methods for uncertainty analysis and planning of proton
trap neutron lifetime experiments (Refs. [1, 2, 3, 4]) and
related experiments such as Ref.
[5]. When a neutron
decays, it produces a proton, an electron and an antineu-
trino. An accurate determination of the mean lifetime
of the neutron is critically important for testing the fun-
damental theories of physics (Ref.
[6]). Further, the
mean lifetime of the neutron is an important parameter
in the astrophysical theory of big bang nucleosynthesis
(Ref.
[7]). In a neutron lifetime experiment performed
at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST), a beam of neutrons passes through a detection
volume. Based on measurements of the neutron ﬂux and
the proton production rate, one measures the mean life-
time of the neutron. Each run of the experiment consists
of trapping stage where protons are conﬁned in a Penning
trap (Refs.
[2, 3]), and a detection stage. The detector
provides incomplete information because it goes dead af-
ter detecting the ﬁrst proton. Based on the number of
runs where a proton is detected, one can estimate the
proton trapping rate. In Ref. [8], approximate formulas
for the bias and variance of the estimated ion trapping

∗kevin.coakley@nist.gov

In Section II, I demonstrate that the bias (expected
value minus true value) and variance of the maximum
likelihood estimate of the trapping rate λ discussed in
Ref.
[8] are both inﬁnite. This is so because a rare re-
alization of the data yields an inﬁnite estimate of λ. In
Ref. [8], this technical diﬃculty was not mentioned. This
technical problem can be dealt with in various ways. One
could quantify uncertainty by constructing conﬁdence in-
tervals of ﬁnite width even though the variance of the
estimate is inﬁnite. Another approach would be to intro-
duce a stopping rule so that the experiment is continued
until no protons are trapped in at least one run.
I do
not pursue either of these approaches here. Instead, I re-
strict the sample space to include only realizations of data
where one observes at least one run where no protons are
trapped. Because of this restriction, the maximum likeli-
hood estimate has ﬁnite moments. In Section III I derive
asymptotically valid formulas for the bias, variance, and
mean-square-error of a maximum likelihood estimate of
the ion trapping rate computed from this subsample. I
stress that the maximum likelihood estimate of λ pre-
sented in Ref.
[8] is the same as that considered here.
The main practical contribution of this work is presented
in Section IV, where, based on nominal values of trap-
ping rate and dead time, I determine the trapping time
that minimizes the root-mean-square prediction error of
the maximum likelihood estimate of λ.

II.

STATISTICAL MODEL

In a simulated proton trapping experiment there are
many runs. During each run, the duration of the proton
trapping stage is τ . After the trapping stage, protons are
purged from the trap. A proton detector provides incom-
plete information because it goes dead after detecting the
ﬁrst of any purged protons. Further, there is a dead time
δ between the end of the trapping stage in one run and
the beginning of the next trapping stage in the next run.
If the total time of the experiment is T , the total number
of runs is

Nrun = IN T (

T
τ + δ

).

(1)

Above, the function IN T (x) rounds the continuous vari-
able x down to the nearest integer. Let n+ be the ob-
served number of runs where at least one count is ob-
served. The number of protons trapped during any pe-
riod is a realization of a Poisson process with expected
value λτ . Hence, the probability that no ion is trapped
for a given period is

p0 = exp(−λτ ).

(2)

and

The maximum likelihood estimate of p0 is

ˆpo = 1 −

n+
Nrun

,

where n+ is the number of runs where at least one ion is
trapped. Thus, the maximum likelihood estimate of λ is

ˆλ = −

ln ˆp0 = −

Since n+ is a Binomial random variable, the probabil-

ity that n+ = k is P (k), where

P (k) =

(5)

Hence, the expected value of the maximum likelihood
estimate of λ is

Similarly, the expected squared value of the estimate is

(7)

and

For λ > 0, P (Nrun) = (1 − p0)Nrun > 0, and both the ex-
pected value (ﬁrst moment) and expected squared value
(second moment) of ˆλ are inﬁnite. The variance of ˆλ,
V AR(ˆλ), is not deﬁned because

V AR(ˆλ) = E(ˆλ2) − (E(ˆλ))2,

(8)

2

and both terms on the right hand side of Eq. 8 are inﬁ-
nite.

To ensure that both E(ˆλ) and E(ˆλ2) are ﬁnite, I re-
strict the sample space to realizations of the data where
n+ < Nrun. From a practical point of view, this means
that realizations of data where n+ = Nrun would be ig-
nored. For neutron lifetime experiments of current in-
terest, the probability that n+ = Nrun is negligible pro-
vided that τ is judiciously chosen. Hence, this subsam-
pling restriction does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect data col-
lection procedures for neutron lifetime experiments of

Since the ﬁrst two moments (Eqns. 10 and 11) of ˆλ are
ﬁnite, the variance of ˆλ is deﬁned and ﬁnite. Next, we
present analytical formulas to approximate the fractional
bias, fractional standard deviation and fractional root-
mean-square prediction error of the estimate computed
for this subsample.

III. ASYMPTOTIC APPROXIMATIONS

To facilitate analysis of ˆλ, I write ˆp0 as

ˆp0 = p0 − ǫ = p0(1 −

ǫ
p0

),

ǫ = p0 − ˆp0,

ln ˆp0 = ln(p0) + ln(1 − w),

The term w is a random variable. I expand ln(1 − w) as
a polynomial function of w using

and take the expected values of each term.
In the
asymptotic limit of large enough Nrun, ǫ has a asymp-
totic normal (Gaussian) distribution with expected value

that the Gaussian approximation is reasonable when
min(E(n+), Nrun − E(n+))) > 5 (Ref. [9]). Hence,

E(− ln(1 − w)) ≈

As mentioned in Section II, n+ is a Binomial random
variable in the original sample space where n+ ≤ Nrun.
Hence, in the original sample space, the variance of n+
is Nrunpo(1 − po). Assuming that P (Nrun) << 1, the
variance of n+ is well approximated as Nrunpo(1 − po) in
the subsample where n+ < Nrun. Thus,

E(ǫ2) = σ2

ǫ ≈

p0(1 − p0)

and E(ǫ4) = 3σ4

tional root-mean-square prediction error (F RM S), and
fractional standard deviation (F SE) of ˆλ are

where δ = 100 µs (0.0001 s) and the true trapping rate
is λ = 1 s−1. These values of λ and δ are typical of
experiments done at NIST. For experiments of total du-
ration of 10 s ,25 s, 50 s, 100 s, and 200 s, F BIAS was
much less than F RM S (see Fig. 1 and Table I). For
the cases summarized in Table I, the fractional system-
atic error and fractional RMS prediction error are well
approximated as F BIAS ∝ T −1, and F RM S ∝ T −1/2,
where the total duration of the experiment is T . For T
= 25 s, 50 s, 100 s, 200 s, the RMS prediction error of ˆλ
takes its minimum value at τ = 0.014 s. The asymptotic
approximation for the RMS prediction error of ˆλ is also
minimized at τ = 0.014 s for these same cases. (The res-
olution of the grid on which I computed RMS prediction
errors is 0.001 s in the neighborhood of the 0.014 s.)

where T is the total time of the experiment and T ∗ de-
pends on δ, λ and τ . For the cases considered here, for
ﬁxed trapping rate λ and dead time δ, T ∗ is approxi-
mately the same for all values of T . An exception to
this rule is when δ is large and there are very few bins. I
attribute this to truncation eﬀects associated with round-
ing Nrun to an integer (Eq. 1). Thus, one can compute
T ∗ from simulation data corresponding to one suﬃciently
large value of T and predict F RM S at other large values
of T . As a caveat, for very short experiments, the asymp-
totic theory may not apply and a direct simulation may
be necessary.

For ﬁxed δ, T ∗ varies with τ and λ (Fig. 2). By scaling
T ∗ and τ by the true trapping rate λ, the optimal value
of τ becomes more clear (Fig. 3). For the cases studied,
the expected number of trapped neutrons per run (λτ )
should be less than 1 (Fig. 3). In an additional study, I
ﬁx the true trapping rate λ and vary τ for a variety of
diﬀerent cases. In each case, the dead time δ is ﬁxed (Fig.
4). For these cases, F RM S increases dramatically when
τ is decreased below the value of δ. Thus, for the cases
summarized in Figs. 3 and 4, I conclude that the optimal
value of the trapping time (τopt) falls in the following
broad interval:

δ < τopt < λ−1.

for selecting the optimal value of τ . The main practical
contribution of this work is an objective method to select
the optimal value of τ from the broad interval given by
Eq. 27 by minimizing the RMS prediction error of ˆλ, or
equivalently, T ∗ in Eq. 26.

V. SUMMARY

In this work, I studied the statistical properties of a
maximum likelihood estimate of the rate at which pro-
tons are trapped in a Penning trap. This study is rel-
evant to in-beam neutron lifetime experiments at NIST
and similar experiments elsewhere. After the ﬁrst proton
is detected, the detector goes dead. Hence, the detector
provides incomplete information. Due to this incomplete-
ness, I showed that the ﬁrst two moments of the maxi-
mum likelihood estimate of the trapping rate λ are inﬁ-
nite. Hence, the variance of the maximum likelihood esti-
mate is not deﬁned. To construct a maximum likelihood
estimate with a ﬁnite variance, I restricted attention to
a subsample of realizations of the data that excludes an
exceedingly rare realization of the data that yields an inﬁ-
nite valued estimate of λ. Based on the discrete probabil-
ity density function for this subsample, I derived formu-
las for the ﬁrst two moments of the maximum likelihood
estimate of λ (Eqns. 10 and 11).
I presented asymp-
totically valid formulas for the fractional bias, fractional
RMS prediction error and fractional standard deviation
of the maximum likelihood estimate (Eqns. 23, 24, and
I showed that the approximation error associated
25).
with these formulas is low for a variety of cases (Table I).

As shown in Fig. 1, the fractional bias of the estimate
is more sensitive to τ than the fractional mean-square
prediction error is. For experimental planning purposes,
my asymptotic formulas should be useful in determining
the optimal data collection strategy and for quantifying
random and systematic errors.

Because there is an inactive dead time δ between the
end of one trapping stage and the beginning of the next
trapping stage, the RMS prediction error of the maxi-
mum likelihood estimate depends on length of the trap-
ping stage τ . For various cases, I showed that the optimal
value of the trapping time τ is greater than the dead time
δ but less than λ−1 (Fig. 4). I selected an optimal value
of τ from this broad interval by minimizing the RMS
prediction error of ˆλ for a variety of cases (Figs. 2, 3,
and 4, Table I ). I clariﬁed the relationship between the
expected number of trapped protons per run (λτ ) and
the RMS prediction error of the maximum likelihood es-
timate.

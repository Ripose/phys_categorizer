A new object of the probability theory, two-sided chain of events (symbols), is introduced. A
theory of multi-steps Markov chains with long-range memory, proposed earlier in Phys. Rev. E
68, 06117 (2003), is developed and used to establish the correspondence between these chains and
two-sided ones. The Markov chain is proved to be statistically equivalent to the deﬁnite two-sided
one and vice versa. The results obtained for the binary chains are generalized to the chains taking
on the arbitrary number of states.

INTRODUCTION

The problem of long-range correlated random symbolic systems (LRCS) has been under study for a long time in
many areas of contemporary physics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], biology [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], economics [8, 13, 14], linguistics [15,
16, 17, 18, 19], etc.

Among the ways to get a correct insight into the nature of correlations of complex dynamic systems the use of the
multi-step Markov chains is one of the most important because they give a possibility to construct a random sequence
with necessary correlated properties in the most natural way. This was demonstrated in Ref. [20], where the concept
of Markov chain with the step-wise memory function, which consist in coordinate independence of the conditional
probability, was introduced. The concept of additive chains turned out to be very useful due to the ability to evaluate
the binary correlation function of the chain through the memory function (see for the details Refs. [24, 25]). The
correlation properties of some dynamic systems (coarse-grained sequences of the Eukarya’s DNA and dictionaries)
can be well described by this model [20].

Another important reason for the study of Markov chains is its application to the various physical objects [21, 22, 23],
e.g., to the Ising chains of spins. The problem of thermodynamics description of the Ising chains with long-range spin
interaction is opened even for the 1D case. However, the association of such systems with the Markov chains can shed
light on the non-extensive thermodynamics of the LRCS.

Multi-step Markov chains are characterized by the probability that each symbol of the sequence takes on the deﬁnite
value under condition that some previous symbols are ﬁxed. This chains can be easily constructed by the consequent
generation using prescribed conditional probability function. Besides, the statistical properties of Markov chains can
be determined in some simple cases. At the same time, there is another class of correlated sequences, the so-called
two-sided chains. They are determined by the probability that each symbol of the sequence takes on the deﬁnite value
under the condition that some symbols at the both sides of the chosen symbol are ﬁxed. An example of systems with
such property is the above-mentioned Ising chain. But the approach, used for the ﬁnding of Markov chains properties
(the probability of concrete ”word” occurring, the correlation functions, and so on) unfortunately cannot be used in
this case. In this paper we prove, that such mathematical objects, determined in the Sec. (II A) as two-sided chains,
are the Markov chains. So, the statistical properties of Markov chains and the method of their constructing can be
used for the studying the two-sided chains.

The paper is organized as follows.

In the ﬁrst Section we give the deﬁnition of Markov and two-sided chains.
The next Section is devoted to the proof of the main statement: the ﬁrst Subsection contains the proof of the direct
statement, that every binary Markov chain is in the same time the binary two-sided one; the second Subsection shows,
that the classes of these two chains coincide. Finally, in the last Subsection we generalize this results to the case of
non-binary chains.

A. General deﬁnitions

Let us determine the N -step Markov chain. This is a sequence of random variables ai, i = −M, −M + 1, . . . , M
(M ≫ N ), referred to as the symbols, which have the following property: the probability of symbol ai to have a
certain value under the condition that the values of all previous symbols are ﬁxed depends on the values of N
previous symbols only,

P (ai = a| . . . , ai−2, ai−1) = P (ai = a|ai−N , . . . , ai−2, ai−1).

(1)

Such deﬁned chain is a stationary one, because the conditional probability does not depend explicitly on i, i.e., does
not depend on the position of symbols ai−N , . . . , ai−1, ai in the chain and depends on the values of the symbols and
their positional relationship only.

The chain under consideration is deﬁned for arbitrary but ﬁnite length M . Nevertheless, all results that will be
obtained do not depend on M . Thus, they are correct in the inﬁnite limit provided that the conditional probability
function is ﬁxed.

In diﬀerent mathematical and physical problems we confront with the sequences for which the probability of
symbol ai to have certain value, under the condition that the values of the rest of symbols are ﬁxed, depends on a
value of N previous and N next symbols only,

P (ai = a| . . . , ai−2, ai−1, ai+1, ai+2, . . .) =

= P (ai = a|ai−N , . . . , ai−1, ai+1, . . . , ai+N ).

(2)

Let us name these chains as N -two-sided ones. By the same reason as above, see Eq. (1), this chain is a stationary
one.

An important class of the random sequences is the binary chains. If each symbol ai of the chain can take on only
two values, s0 and s1, then we refer to this chain as a binary. It is convenient to change a value of ai to 0 and 1 using
a linear transformation,

Now, we will describe the ways of the constructing of the deﬁned chains.

ai :=

ai − s0
s1 − s0

.

B. Constructing of the chains

The Markov chain deﬁned in such way is simple for numerical simulations. There are two basic approaches for this.
In both of them we ﬁnd successively the each next generated symbol by N previous ones. But these approaches diﬀer
in the method of constructing for the ﬁrst N -word, the set of N sequent symbols.

For ﬁrst approach one needs to calculate in addition some conditional probabilities. They can be found from the

compatibility equation for the conditional probabilities:

P (ai = a|ai−k, . . . , ai−1) =

Pai−N

Pai−k−1

. . .

P (ai = a|ai−N , . . . , ai−1)P (ai−N , . . . , ai−1)

. . .

P (ai−N , . . . , ai−1)

Pai−N

Pai−k−1

.

(3)

Here k = 0, . . . , N − 1 and the sign

means summation (or integration) over all possible values of symbol aj. The

Paj

probabilities of N -words occurring, P (ai−N , . . . , ai−1), should be obtained from the following linear system,

P (a1, a2, . . . , aN ) =

P (aN |a0, a1, . . . , aN −1)P (a0, a1, . . . , aN −1),

. . .

P (a1, a2, . . . , aN ) = 1.

Using Eq. (3) we can construct the ﬁrst N symbols consequently generating them in accordence to the following
conditional probabilities:

P (a1), P (a2|a1), P (a3|a1, a2), . . . , P (aN |a1, . . . , aN −1).

The second approach is based on the random choice of N -word. The second approach is simpler than the ﬁrst one
because it does not make the calculation of additional probabilities. But it does not allows to get the stationary chain,
as it is possible in the ﬁrst method. For generation of the same chain using the second approach we must construct
as many symbols as one needs to get the stationary chain (the initial part of the chain should be removed).

There is no simple method for two-sided chains constructing. The best known and simple approach is Metropolis’
algorithm, but it needs much more operations than constructing of the Markov chain. Therefore it is very important
to prove the equivalence of the Markov and two-sided chains.

III.

EQUIVALENCE OF THE MARKOV AND TWO-SIDED CHAINS

In this section we prove an equivalence of two random sequences, the Markov and two-sided chains. The proof is
produced for a binary chain, but it can be directly generalized for arbitrary chains (see Subsection III C for details).
This proof requires some formulas for a conditional probability. Its deﬁnition is

Here and below comma between the symbols-events means that both of these events occur simultaneously, it is a
product of two events, (A, B) = A

B. Using evident equation,

P (A|B) =

P (A, B|C) = P (A|B, C)P (B|C),

P (A|B, C) =

P (A, B|C)
P (A, B|C) + P (A, B|C)

,

A. From the Markov to two-sided chain

the following formula can be easily obtained,

where A is an event opposite to A.

Let us demonstrate that a Markov chain is a two-sided one. For this purpose using Eq. (7) we rewrite the probability
for symbol ai to be equal unity, under the condition that the values of the rest of symbols are ﬁxed, in following
form:

P (ai = 1|A−

i , A+

i ) =

P (ai = 1, A+

P (ai = 1, A+
i |A−

i |A−
i )
i ) + P (ai = 0, A+

.

i |A−
i )

where A−

i = (. . . , ai−2, ai−1) and A+
To obtain the value of P (ai = 1, A+

i = (ai+1, ai+2, . . .).
i |A−
P (ai = 1, A+

i ) one needs to use Eq. (6) many times to express P (.|.) as the product:
i |A−
i+1|ai = 1, A−

i ) = P (ai = 1|A−

i )P (ai+1, A+

i ) =

i+2|A−

i , ai = 1, ai+1) = . . .

However the chain under consideration is the N -step Markov one and, according to deﬁnition (1), the probability of
symbol ai, under the condition that the values of all previous symbols are ﬁxed, depends on the values of N previous

symbols only. So, the factors of the product for r > i + N in Eq. (9) do not depend on ai. Substituting expression (9)
for P (ai = 1, A+

i ) into Eq. (8) we derive the following equation,

i |A−

Equation (10) is the fundamental relation for association of Markov and two-sided chains. One can see from it that
the probability of symbol ai under the condition of ﬁxed values of the rest of symbols is determined only by two
words of the length N , T −
i . So, according to deﬁnition (2), the Markov chain is the two-sided one, quod erat
demonstrandum.

B. From two-sided to the Markov chain

Now we prove the opposite statement: the two-sided chain is a Markov one. I.e., we prove that the probability of the
symbol ai to be equal to unity, under the condition that all previous symbols are ﬁxed, depends on the values of N
previous symbols only. Thereto, let us take two sets of symbols A′ and A′′ which are two variants of the word A−
i−N
and diﬀer only by one symbol ai−N −k at arbitrary value of k > 0.
Using deﬁnition of the conditional probability (5) we obtain

P (ai|A′, T −

i ) =

P (A′, T −
i , ai)
P (A′, T −
i )

=

P (a′

i−N −k| ˜A, T −

i , ai)
i )P ( ˜A, T −
i )

=

P (a′

i−N −k| ˜A, T −
i , ai)
i−N −k| ˜A, T −
i )

P (a′

P (ai| ˜A, T −

i ),

where ˜A is a set of symbols A′ (or A′′) except for symbol ai−N −k. However, according to the deﬁnition of two-sided
chain, conditional probability P (a′
i , ai) does not depend on symbol ai since the latter is situated at a
distance more than N from ai−N −k. Hence one gets

i−N −k| ˜A, T −

P (ai|A′, T −

i ) = P (ai| ˜A, T −

i ) = P (ai|A′′, T −
i ).

So, we ﬁnd that probability P (ai|A−

i ) takes on the same value for any arbitrary word A−

i−N . We conclude that the

probability does not depend on A−

i−N . Thus we attest ourselves that

In other words, according to deﬁnition (1), the two-sided chain is a Markov one, quod erat demonstrandum.

It should be emphasized that every two-sided chain is equivalent to the single Markov one though it is not evident

because of the non-linear structure of Eq. (10). Using trivial expression of Eq. (5),

P (ai|A−

i ) = P (ai|T −
i ).

P (ai|T −

i ) =

P (T −
i , ai)
P (T −
i )

,

one can easily make sure that a single chain cannot have two diﬀerent conditional probabilities. The matter is that
the probabilities of N - and (N + 1)-words occurring determines uniquely the conditional probability according to
Eq. (11). Hence, for the chain under study the Markov conditional probability is determined uniquely.

The results obtained in previous Secs. III A and III B can be generalized to non-binary chains. And we can develop

the similar proof and get the following equation connecting the conditional probability functions,

that is analogue of Eq. (10).

In this formula we used the following notations:
– if symbol a takes on the ﬁnite set of values A then we use the conditional probabilities P (a| . . .);
– if symbol a takes on the continuous set of values A then we used conditional probability density P (a| . . .) and

Thus, the equivalence between the N-two-sided and N-step Markov chains is proved for non-binary chains also. We
found the very important formula for the conversion the Markov’s conditional probability to the two-sided one and
inversely. This method can be used for numerical and analytic calculations of the conditional probabilities.

IV. CONCLUSION

Thus, we proved that the classes of the “one-sided” Markov chains and two-sided ones coincide. The obtained
relationship between the conditional probabilities (or its densities in the case of continuous distribution of values
taking on by the elements of the chains) allows to construct numerically the Markov chain possessing the same
statistical properties as the initial two-sided one. So, two-sided sequence can be easily reproduced numerically with
conservation of all statistical properties but not binary correlation function as it was done in the papers [24, 25].

Besides, found Eq. (12) allows to use results of analytical studies of Markov chains (for example, see [25]) for the
two-sided sequences. This can be very useful for the study of physical systems. The example is the Ising chain, that
is the two-sided one.

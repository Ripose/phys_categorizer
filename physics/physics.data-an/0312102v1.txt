Blind Analysis in Particle Physics

A review of the blind analysis technique, as used in particle physics measurements, is presented. The history of
blind analyses in physics is brieﬂy discussed. Next the dangers of experimenter’s bias and the advantages of a
blind analysis are described. Three distinct kinds of blind analysis in particle physics are presented in detail.
Finally, the BABAR collaboration’s experience with the blind analysis technique is discussed.

1. Introduction

A blind analysis is a measurement which is per-
formed without looking at the answer. Blind analyses
are the optimal way to reduce or eliminate experi-
menter’s bias, the unintended biasing of a result in a
particular direction.

In bio-medical research the double-blind random-
ized clinical trial is the standard way to avoid bias.
In such experiments both patients and clinicians are
blind to the individual assignments of treatments
to patients, and that assignment is made randomly.
A double-blind randomized trial was ﬁrst used in
1948 by Hill in a study of antibiotic treatments for
tuberculosis[1]. Amazingly, the concept of a double-
blind trial dates back to at least 1662, when John Bap-
tista van Helmont made the following challenge[1]:

Let us take out of the hospitals,... 200,
or 500 poor People, that have Fevers,
Pleurisies, etc. Let us divide them into
half, let us cast lots, that one half of them
may fall to my share, and the other to
yours; I will cure them without blood-
letting and sensible evacuation... We shall
see how many funerals both of us shall
have. But let the reward of the contention
or wager, be 300 ﬂorens, deposited on both
sides...

A notable early use of a blind analysis in physics
was in a measurement of the e/m of the electron, by
Dunnington [2].
In this measurement, the e/m was
proportional to the angle between the electron source
and the detector. Dunnington asked his machinist to
arbitrarily choose an angle around 340o. Only when
the analysis was complete, and Dunnington was ready
to publish a result, did he accurately measure the hid-
den angle.

2. Experimenter’s Bias

Experimenter’s bias is deﬁned as the unintended in-
ﬂuence on a measurement towards prior results or the-
oretical expectations. Next, we consider some of the

ways in which an unintended bias could be present in
a measurement.

One scenario involves the choice of experimental se-
lection requirements, or cuts. Often, a measurement
may be equally well done, in terms of sensitivity or
uncertainties, with a range of values for a particular
selection cut, and the exact cut value used may be
chosen arbitrarily. This is illustrated in the cartoon
in Fig 1, where there is a plateau in the sensitivity,
and the cut value could be chosen anywhere in that
plateau. However, the value of the result may vary,
typically within the statistical uncertainty, depending
on the exact value of cut chosen. If the cuts are set
with knowledge of how that choice aﬀects the results,
experimenter’s bias could occur. In this case, the size
of the bias could be on the order of the statistical
uncertainty.
Another,

less subtle, scenario involves measure-
ments of small signals, such as the search for rare
processes or decays. Here experimenter’s bias could
occur if the event selection is determined with prior
knowledge of the eﬀect of that selection on the data.
One danger is that the selection cuts can be tuned
to remove a few extra background-like events, yield-
ing a result biased to lower limits. Another danger is
that the cuts can be tuned to improve the statistical
signiﬁcance of a small signal.

In general, experimenter’s bias may occur if obtain-
ing the correct result is the standard used to evalu-

ate the quality of the measurement. The validity of
a measurement may be checked in a number of ways,
such as internal consistency, stability under variations
of cuts, data samples or procedures, and comparisons
between data and simulation. The numerical result,
and how well it agrees with prior measurements or the
Standard Model, contains no real information about
the internal correctness of the measurement. If such
agreement is used to justify the completion of the mea-
surement, then possible remaining problems could go
unnoticed, and an experimenter’s bias occur.

Does experimenter’s bias occur in particle physics
measurements? Consider the results on the ratio B
meson lifetimes shown in Figure 2. The average has a
χ2 = 4.5 for 13 degrees of freedom; a χ2 this small or
smaller occurs only 1.5% of the time. At this level, the
good agreement between measurements is suspicious,
but for each individual result no negative conclusion
should be made. Nonetheless, it can be argued that
even the possibility of a bias represents a problem.
The PDG[3] has compiled a number of measurements
that have curious time-histories. Likewise, while it is
diﬃcult to draw negative conclusions about a single
measurement, the overall impression is that experi-
menter’s bias does occur. Finally, there are numer-
ous examples in particle physics of small signals, on
the edge of statistical signiﬁcance, that turned out to
be artifacts. Here too, experimenter’s bias may have
been present.

In all of these cases, the possibility of experimenter’s
bias is akin to a systematic error. Unlike more typi-
cal systematic eﬀects, an experimenter’s bias cannot
be numerically estimated. Therefore, a technique to

3. Blind Analysis

A Blind Analysis is a measurement performed with-
out looking at the answer, and is the optimal way to
avoid experimenter’s bias. A number of diﬀerent blind
analysis techniques have been used in particle physics
in recent years. Here, several of these techniques are
reviewed. In each case, the type of blind analysis is
well matched to the measurement.

3.1. Hidden Signal Box

The hidden signal box technique explicitly hides the
signal region until the analysis is completed. This
method is well suited to searches for rare processes,
when the signal region is known in advance. Any
events in the signal region, often in two variables, are
kept hidden until the analysis method, selection cuts,
and background estimates are ﬁxed. Only when the
analysis is essentially complete is the box opened, and
an upper limit or observation made.

The hidden signal box technique was used1 in a
L → µ±e∓. This decay
search for the rare decay K 0
was not expected to occur in the Standard Model,
and the single event sensitivity of the experiment was
one event in 1011 K 0
L decays. Any signal was expected
inside the box in Mµe and P 2
T shown in Figure 3; the
possible contents of this box were kept hidden until
the analysis was completed[4].

The use of this method is now a standard method
for rare decay searches, when the signal region is
known in advance. One additional subtlety lies in the
size of the hidden box. Generally, the box is initially
chosen to be somewhat larger than the signal region,
so that the ﬁnal signal cuts may be chosen without
bias as well. Otherwise, this technique is straightfor-
ward to apply.

3.2. Hidden Answer

For precision measurements of parameters, a dif-
ferent technique for avoiding bias must be used.
In
this case, hiding the answer is often the appropriate
method. The KTeV experiment used this technique
in its measurement of ǫ′/ǫ. The value of ǫ′/ǫ was
found in a ﬁt to the data, and a small value of or-
der 10−4 − 10−3 was expected.
In this case, KTeV
inserted an unknown oﬀset into its ﬁtting program, so
that the result of the ﬁt was the hidden value:

ǫ′/ǫ (Hidden) =

× ǫ′/ǫ + C

(1)

1
−1 (cid:27)

(cid:26)

where C was a hidden random constant, and the
choice of 1 or −1 was also hidden and random. The
value of the hidden constant, C, was made by a
pseudo-random number generator with a reasonable
distribution and mean. KTeV could determine its
data samples, analysis cuts, Monte-Carlo corrections,
and ﬁtting technique while the result remained hid-
den, by looking only at ǫ′/ǫ (Hidden). The use of the
1 or −1 factor prevented KTeV from knowing which
direction the result moved as changes were made. In
practice, the result[5] was unblinded only one week
before the value was announced.

The hidden answer technique is well-suited to pre-
cise measurements of a single quantity. The complete
analysis, as well as the error analysis, may proceed
while blind to the result. An additional consideration
is whether there are any distributions which will give
away the blinded result. Often the exact value of the
measurement is not readily apparent from the relevant
plots; in this case those plots can be used without is-
sue.

3.3. Hidden Answer and Asymmetry

For certain measurements hiding the answer is not
suﬃcient; it may also be necessary to hide the visual
aspect of the measurement. One example is an asym-
metry measurement, such as the recent CP -violation
measurement by BABAR. In this case, the rough size
and sign of the asymmetry can be seen by looking at
the ∆t distributions for B0 and B0 decays into CP
eigenstates, as shown in Figure 4a. Before CP viola-
tion had been established, and to avoid any chance of

bias, a blind analysis was developed to hide both the
answer and the visual asymmetry.

In BABAR’s CP -violation measurement the result,
found from a ﬁt to the data, was hidden as in Equa-
tion 1. In addition, the asymmetry itself was hidden
by altering the ∆t distribution used to display the
data.[7] To hide the asymmetry the variable:

∆t (Blind) =

× sTag × ∆t + Oﬀset

(2)

1
−1 (cid:27)

(cid:26)

was used to display the data. The variable sTag is
equal to 1 or −1 for B0 or B0 ﬂavor tags. Since
the asymmetry is nearly equal and opposite for the
diﬀerent B ﬂavors, we hid the asymmetry by ﬂipping
one of the distributions. In addition, the CP -violation
can be visualized by the asymmetry of the individual
B0 and B0 distributions. In turn, this was hidden by
adding the hidden oﬀset which has the eﬀect of hiding
the ∆t = 0 point. The result is shown in Figure 4b,
where the amount of CP -violation is no longer visible
(the remaining diﬀerence is due to charm lifetime ef-
fects). Also it is worth noting that for a given data
sample, due to statistical ﬂuctuations, the maximum

of the distribution will not exactly correspond to the
∆t = 0 point, as in the smooth curves shown.

This blind analysis technique allowed BABAR to use
the ∆tBlind distribution to validate the analysis and
explore possible problems, while remaining blind to
the presence of any asymmetry. There was one ad-
ditional restriction, that the result of the ﬁt could
not be superimposed on the data, since the smooth
ﬁt curve would eﬀectively show the asymmetry. In-
stead to assess the agreement of the ﬁt curve and the
data, a distribution of just the residuals was used. In
practice, this added only a small complication to the
measurement. However, after the second iteration of
the measurement, it became clear that the asymme-
try would also remain blind if the only ∆t distribution
used was of the sum of B0 and B0 events, and that
no additional checks were needed using the individual
∆t distributions.

3.4. Other Blind Methods

The kinds of measurements already discussed, such
as rare searches and precision measurements of phys-
ical parameters, are well suited to the blind analy-
sis technique. Other kinds of analyses are diﬃcult to
adapt to the methods described. For instance, branch-
ing fraction measurements typically require the careful
study of the signal sample in both data and simula-
tion, so it is not possible to avoid knowing the number
of signal events or the eﬃciency. In this case, other
techniques may be considered. One method is to ﬁx
the analysis on a sub-sample of the data, and then
used the identical method on the full data sample.
One may argue about the correct amount of data to
use in the ﬁrst stage, too little and backgrounds or
other complications may not be visible, too much and
the technique loses its motivating purpose. Another
method is to mix an unknown amount of simulated
data into the data sample, removing it only when the
analysis is complete.

Another diﬃcult example is the search for new par-
ticles, or bump-hunting. In this case, since the signal
region is not known a-priori, there is no one place
to put a hidden signal box. However, such measure-
ments may be the most vulnerable to the eﬀects of
experimenter’s bias. Certainly, there is some history
of statistically signiﬁcant bumps that are later found
to be artifacts. The possibility of using a blind anal-
ysis technique may depend on the understanding of

the relevant background.
If the background can be
estimated independently of the bump-hunting region,
than the analysis and selection cuts may be set in-
dependently of the search for bumps. Here again is
a case in which the exact method used must be well
matched to the measurement in question.
4. Conclusion

The experience of the BABAR collaboration in us-
ing blind analyses is instructive. While the collabora-
tion had initial reservations about the blind analysis
technique, it has now become a standard method for
BABAR [8]. Often the blind analysis is a part of the in-
ternal review of BABAR results. Results are presented
and reviewed, before they are unblinded, and changes
are made while the analysis is still blind. Then when
either a wider analysis group or an internal review
committee is satisﬁed with the measurement the re-
sult is unblinded, ultimately to be published. With
several years of data taking, and many results, BABAR
has successfully used blind analyses.

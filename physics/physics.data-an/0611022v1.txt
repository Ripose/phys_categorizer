Bending Wavelet for Flexural Impulse Response

Richard B¨ussow∗

(Dated: October 31, 2012)

The work addresses the deﬁnition of a wavelet that is adapted to analyse a ﬂexural impulse
response. The wavelet gives the opportunity to directly analyse the dispersion characteristics of
a pulse. The aim is to localize a source or to measure material parameters. An overview on
the mathematical properties of the wavelet is presented. An algorithm to extract the dispersion
characteristics with the use of genetic algorithms is outlined. The application of the wavelet is
shown in an example and experiment.

I. INTRODUCTION

3. one sensor measuring two distinguishable wave

The wavelet transform is a promising method to eval-
uate the frequency dependent arrival time of a pulse in
dispersive media. It can be used for the localization of
sources and anomalies in a object1,2,3. The underlying
concept of this method will be brieﬂy explained for a
one-dimensional structure (e.g. a beam).
A fundamental diﬀerence between most waveforms in
structures and ﬂuids is the dispersion. An pulse propa-
gating in a structure with the frequency dependent group
velocity cg changes its shape. Due to this dispersion the
pulse is not recognizable with correlation techniques that
can be useful in locating airborne sound sources.
The wavelet transform is very useful to extract exactly
the arrival time ta of an pulse in a dispersive media

ta = x/cg.

If the position of the source is known it is possible to
extract material parameters5. To improve this method
dispersion based transforms have been proposed6, which
is based on a method called Chirplet transform7,8.
Here a diﬀerent for bending waves is presented. The un-
derlying concept is not to measure the arrival time but to
extract directly the dispersion of the pulse. The disper-
sion of the pulse is dependent on the distance between
source and receiver. If it is possible to extract exactly this
spreading of the pulse one has directly the distance or the
material properties, depending on which is known. The
velocity v(x, t) resulting from the bending wave propaga-
tion for inﬁnite plate of a force impulse Fa(t) = F0 δ(t)

is named dispersion number, which is a measure of the
spreading of the diﬀerent spectral fractions of the pulse.
In the following a new adapted wavelet will be derived to
extract the dispersion number from the measured pulse.
Usually a wavelet is designed to localize a certain fre-
quency. The proposed wavelet has a frequency range that
is distributed over the wavelet length just like equation
(3).
One may interpret the continuous Wavelet transform as
a cross-correlation of y and ψ. The underlying concept is
to ﬁnd the function which is highly correlated with the
impulse response. The diﬀerence is the role of the scaling
parameter a. It is vital to produce the presented results
to use the scaling parameter as it is deﬁned in equation
(2).
The dispersion number is determined by the scaling fac-
tor with the highest value of the scalogram. In principle

Bending Wavelet 1

this can be done with a ﬁne grid of (a, b) values. A more
eﬃcient way is to use a optimisation scheme. Gradient
based optimisation is not reliable in ﬁnding a global op-
timum. A second problem is the localisation of several
overlapping pulses. A popular method that is able to
fulﬁll these requirements are genetic algorithms.

tion should be used that leads to a simple expression for
cψ. The support of the wavelet is deﬁned by

II. BENDING WAVELET

Several diﬀerent deﬁnitions based on the Morlet
wavelet and the Chirplet transform7,8 have been inves-
tigated. For brevity a extensive discussion about the dif-
ferent eﬀorts is omitted. The details of the mathematical
background of the wavelet transform can be found in the
literature9,10.
The section begins with the deﬁnition of a wavelet with
compact support and zero-mean. It follows a comment
on the amplitude and frequency distribution and ends
with possible optional deﬁnitions.

A. Deﬁnition

which means that the admissibility condition is fulﬁlled
if

called bending wavelet. To fulﬁll the admissibility condi-
tion tmin and tmax are deﬁned so, that equation (5) holds.

B. Displacement-invariant deﬁnition

This is a very easy option to deﬁne a wavelet and it
will be used later to deﬁne similar wavelet. Equation

Wavelets that are deﬁned by real functions have the
property, that the scalogram depends on the phase of

the analysed function. Wavelets that are complex func-
tions like e.g. the Morlet wavelet are called displacement-
invariant. A wavelet ψ = ψc + iψs that consists of a sine,

To illustrate the integral two diﬀerent versions of the
wavelet are plotted in ﬁgure 2.

The eﬀect is that the real- and the imaginary part of the
resulting wavelet do not share the same support. This is
a awkward deﬁnition but the diﬀerence between the two
supports is rather small if the same value for nmax/min
is used. To keep things simple only the real valued sine
wavelet is used in following.

C. Orthogonality of the bending wavelet

The trigonometric functions that are used for the
Fourier transform establish an orthogonal base. Hence,
the Fourier transform has the convenient characteristic
that only one value represents one frequency in the anal-
ysed signal. Every deviation of this is due to the window-
ing function that is analysed with the signal. Already the
short time Fourier transform is not orthogonal, if the dif-
ferent windows overlap each other. Because of this over-
lap the continuous wavelet transform can not be orthog-
onal. The proposed wavelet should still be investigated
since it is instructive for the interpretation of the results.
The condition for a orthogonal basis in Lebesgue space
L2 of square integrable functions is

(ψj, ψk) =

ψjψk = δjk.

(17)

Z−∞

Two diﬀerent wavelets ψj ψk can be build by using dif-
ferent scaling parameters a and/or diﬀerent displacement
parameters b. Here the eﬀect of two scaling parameters
is investigated, so the following integral is to be solved

The sine term in equation (19) vanishes since tmin/max,
also scale with a, but actually there are two diﬀerent
values of a and so not all four sine terms vanish. With
this result one expects a rather broad area in (a, b) with
high values of the scalogram.

D. Time amplitude/frequency distribution

The time frequency distribution of the wavelet for a
certain scaling factor a is determined by the argument of
the sine function. The actual frequency of the wavelet is
given by

ω(t) = a/t2.

(20)

The 1/t leading term aﬀects the amplitude of the wavelet.
Usually it is desired that the whole signal contributes
linearly to the transform. To achieve this it is useful to
have an amplitude distribution over time of the wavelet
that is reciprocal to the amplitude distribution of the
analysed signal. Since the bending wavelet has the same
amplitude distribution as equation (3) this may lead to
stronger weighting of the early high frequency compo-
nents of the impulse response.
A force impulse that compensates the amplitude distri-
1/ω2 depen-
bution of the impulse response follows a
dence.

III. CONTINUOUS WAVELET TRANSFORM WITH THE
BENDING WAVELET

The application in the given context is to extract pre-
cisely the scaling factor with the highest value. How this
is achieved will be discussed in the next section. Never-
theless, the realisation of a transform will be illustrative.
The algorithm implementing the continuous wavelet
transform with the bending wavelet can not be the same
as the algorithm implementing a transform with any con-
tinuous wavelet, like the Morlet wavelet. The bending
wavelet has a compact support, which must be deﬁned
prior to the transform. This can be done with a estima-
tion of the frequency range and the dispersion number.
With the equations (9) and (20) it holds that

nmax = ﬂoor

nmin = ceil

Difmax

 r

where ﬂoor(
) rounds down towards the nearest integer
·
and ceil(
) rounds up. The knowledge of a useful fre-
·
quency range should not provide any problems. But to
know before which dispersion number will dominate the
result is rather unsatisfactory. A more practical solution
is to calculate the corresponding n-value within the algo-
rithm, which is a easy task since a = Di. The problem
with this possibility is that the support of the wavelet
changes within the transform. Since the support is part
of the wavelet this means that strictly one compares the
results of two diﬀerent wavelets. Since the wavelet is
normalised the eﬀect is rather small, but nevertheless it
should be interpreted with care.

FIG. 4. Contour plot of the scalogram build with the bending
wavelet transform of equation (22) with fmax = fs/8 and
fmin = 4

with a = 10. The sampling frequency is fs = 29, tmin
and tmax are deﬁned by the corresponding values of
fmax = fs/8 and fmin = 4, for convenience the point
t = tmin is shifted to 10∆t. The example function
equation (22) is plotted in ﬁgure 3.
The example function is transformed with the algorithm
that calculates nmin and nmax with the corresponding
value of fmax, fmin and a. The choice of the frequency
range is critical, if it is too small information will be lost
and if it is too big the parts that overlap the pulse may
distort the result. Here the same frequency range as the
analysed function is used.
The resulting scalogram is not plotted directly against
the factor b, but shifted with the value of tmin. So

One may recognise that there are very high values if
the wavelet is shifted and scaled along the curve a/t. This
is expected theoretical, in section II.C, and can be inter-
preted descriptive since the wavelet does not localize one
frequency, but has a wide frequency range that spreads
over time. It can be quantiﬁed with equation (17). Eval-
uating this integral numerically for the values of a1 = 10,
a2 = 11.75 and b2 = 7∆t results in value of 0.68, which
means that the peak at a2 = 11.75 has 68% of the peak
at a1 = 10.
This problem of non-orthogonality is addressed by the
following algorithm. The pulse is extracted from the sig-
nal by ﬁrst locating the position tstart in the signal, where
fmax has its maximum. This is done by a Morlet wavelet

Until max number of generations

In the end only the ﬁttest individual is extracted. The
algorithm is usually quite reliable. Nevertheless, since it
is a stochastic method, it can be beneﬁcial to restart the
whole process or to work with several sub-populations.

As an example the already transformed equation (22)
is investigated. The frequency range is the same as the
example plotted in ﬁgure 5. As a ﬁrst step the value
tstart is calculated with a Morlet wavelet transform at
fs/12. The result is plotted in ﬁgure 6, the maximum
is at ti = 122. From ﬁgure 5 one may conclude that
the correct value is 120 this slight deviation is due to the
fact that the Morlet wavelet has a rather broad frequency
resolution and the amplitude of the signal is increasing
with time. If the signal sin(a/t)/t is used the maximum
is located at 118. The number of individuals is chosen to
100 the number of generations to 400.
The initial chromosome has a time index range of
(106, 138) which is 3/4λ and the range of the scaling fac-
tor is (5, 15). The obtained scaling factor is a = 9.99.
The frequency range of the bending wavelet is shorter
than the values fwmax = 37.7 < 42.7 = fs/12 and
fwmin = 4.756 < 4 < fmin, this due to equation 21.
The wavelet with the best scaling factor and the exam-
ple function are plotted together in ﬁgure 7. One may
recognize that the frequency-time distribution of both
function match.

tion with the bending wavelet is only done in the vicinity

deﬁned with tstart.

IV. LOCALIZATION WITH A GENETIC ALGORITHM

Genetic algorithms (GA) are a particular class of evo-
lutionary algorithms that use techniques inspired by evo-
lutionary biology such as inheritance, mutation, selec-
tion, and crossover. Genetic algorithms are categorized
as global search heuristics. For details of the method
please refer to the extensive literature, e.g.11.
The genetic algorithm is chosen, since it is usually very
reliable in ﬁnding a global optimum and its ability to ﬁnd
Pareto optimums to locate several pulses. However the
drawback is the slow convergence, that can be improved
with a local search method. Recent publications in the
given context are12,13.
The implementation is done with functions provided by
the open source Matlab toolbox14, if not stated other-
wise. Principally possible but not used in the exam-
ple is the localization of two pulses that are overlapping.
For the sake of brevity a discussion on how this can be
achieved will be omitted. The algorithm works with two
variables, displacement parameter and scaling factor of
the bending wavelet.
λ/2
The displacement parameter is deﬁned by tstart ±
or smaller values this depends on the size of the Mor-
let wavelet. For discrete functions it is a integer value,
but nevertheless implemented as a ﬂoating point number,
because of lacking support for such a combination in the
toolbox. This fact is taken into account when calculat-
ing the wavelet transform. The following pseudo-code
describes the genetic algorithm:

sired force excitation is done with a magnetic force trans-
ducer. The dispersion number for this pulse is chosen to
Di = 0.012 with the given material properties of the
beam the location of the pulse is at ximp = 0.6m. The
velocity is measured with a laser vibrometer in a dis-
tance of xmeas = 1.13m. The measured velocity is anal-
ysed with the bending wavelet and a maximum value of
Di = 0.00895 is extracted within a frequency range be-
tween fmax = 9.8kHz and fmin = 1.1kHz. The value
of ∆xm = 0.51m corresponds quite well with the theo-
retical value of ∆xt = 0.53m. The power spectrum over
time is calculated with a Morlet wavelet transform and
plotted in ﬁgure 9.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

The deﬁnition of a new adapted wavelet is shown to
be useful for analysing a ﬂexural impulse response. It is
possible

1. to obtain the distance of a pulse or the material

properties with only one measurement,

2. to measure the material properties in a built in sit-

uation and

3. to analyse two overlapping pulse, which is not pos-
sible with the maximum of the Morlet wavelet
transform where for each frequency one maximum
value is extracted.

The accuracy and usability of the method seems to be
promising. In the experiments a source could be local-
ized with a deviation lower than 10%.
A precondition for the assessment is that the dispersion
number is rather high and that the wave has a dispersion
relation that follows a
The choice of a useful frequency range can be problem-
atic. It may be useful to ﬁrst analyse the signal with a
Morlet transform to ﬁnd a useful range.

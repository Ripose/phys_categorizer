Abstract

KamLAND is a reactor neutrino oscillation experiment with a very long baseline.
This experiment successfully measured oscillation phenomena of reactor antineutri-
nos coming mainly from 53 reactors in Japan. In order to extract the results, it is
necessary to accurately calculate time-dependent antineutrino spectra from all the
reactors. A simple model of reactor cores and code implementing it were developed
for this purpose. This paper describes the model of the reactor cores used in the
KamLAND reactor analysis.

The experiment detects low energy antineutrinos (ν e’s) coming from a number
of reactors at a typical distance of ∼180 km away from the detector. Kam-
LAND showed evidence for reactor ν e disappearance in 2003 [2], and evidence
for the distortion of the νe energy spectrum, which is consistent with neutrino
oscillation, in 2005 [3]. In order to extract the oscillation signal, the Kam-
LAND experiment compares the observed and expected energy spectra. Due
to the eﬀect of neutrino oscillation, the ν e energy spectrum changes as follows
in the two-neutrino mixing case,

n(Eν e) = n0(Eνe)

1 − sin22θ sin2 ∆m2L
4Eνe !

,

 

(1)

− m2

where Eν e is the ν e energy, n0(Eνe) is the νe energy spectrum in the absence
of neutrino oscillation and n(Eνe) is the expected νe energy spectrum with
neutrino oscillation. ∆m2 is the diﬀerence of the squared neutrino masses,
∆m2 = m2
1, and L is the distance between the detector and the source.
2
The oscillation parameters, ∆m2 and sin2 2θ, are determined from the fre-
quency and amplitude of this change. The time dependence of the number of
ν e’s per unit power generation changes as much as 10% because the compo-
nents of nuclear fuel change during the burnup. It is therefore necessary to
trace the burnup eﬀect for each reactor. However, for the case of KamLAND,
there are many reactors that contribute ν e events and it is practically im-
possible to calculate the burnup eﬀect using a detailed simulation for all the
reactors. This paper describes a simple reactor model with which to accurately
calculate the ν e spectrum of each reactor using the routinely recorded reactor
operation parameters. The parameters include the time-dependent thermal
output, burnup, and 235U enrichment of exchanged fuel and its volume ratio.

2 Antineutrino generation in reactors

2.1 Expected reactor antineutrino spectrum

Nuclear reactors are rich νe sources. The ﬁssion products are generally neutron
rich nuclei and undergo successive β-decays, each yielding one ν e. About 6 ν e’s
are produced per ﬁssion along with an average energy release of ∼ 200 MeV. A
typical reactor operating at 3 GW thermal output produces ∼ 7×1020 νe’s per
second. At the same time, nuclear transmutation through neutron absorption
and beta decays of the fuel elements changes the composition of the nuclear
fuel. In particular, plutonium is created due to neutron capture by 238U. The
plutonium production scheme is shown below. The produced 239Pu and 240Pu

The four main isotopes, 235U, 238U, 239Pu and 241Pu, contribute more than
99.9% of the total power generation. Contributions from other elements can
be safely ignored. The component of nuclear fuel changes as a function of
“burnup”, which is deﬁned as the time integrated thermal output W (t) per
initial nuclear fuel mass M,

b =

(2)

The commonly used unit is giga-watt×day/ton. The burnup is a basic pa-
rameter which indicates the condition of nuclear fuel. For constant thermal
output operation, the burnup is proportional to the operation time. Typical
nuclear fuel resides in the reactor core for 3-5 years and total thermal out-
put is designed to be 30 MW/t. Therefore, at the end of about one year of
each operation cycle, incremental burnup from the beginning of cycle (BOC)
reaches approximately 10 GWd/t.

The production rate of reactor νe’s is obtained from the ﬁssion rates and the
ν e energy spectra per ﬁssion. In the KamLAND data analysis, we compare
the experimental data with the expected neutrino ﬂux of a superposition of
all the reactor cores in the integral live time period of the detector. The energy
spectrum of the expected reactor ν e ﬂux is written as,

2.2 Antineutrino detection

The KamLAND detector consists of 1 kton of liquid scintillator surrounded
by 1879 17/20-inch-diameter photomultiplier tubes. In the liquid scintillator,
ν e’s are detected through the inverse β-decay reaction with protons,

ν e + p → e+ + n.

The cross section is closely related to the neutron lifetime and known with 0.2%
accuracy [4]. The energy threshold of this reaction is 1.8 MeV and the ν e’s
produced in the β-decays of 239U and 239Np in nuclear fuel do not contribute to
the reaction. The positron and its annihilation gammas produce scintillation
light which is proportional to Eνe − 0.8 MeV. The ν e visible energy spectrum
can be written as,

n(Eν e) = Npσ(Eνe)Ψ(Eνe),

(5)

where Np is the number of target protons in the detector and σ(Eν e) is the
inverse β-decay cross section. Fig. 1 shows the neutrino energy spectrum of
each ﬁssile isotope, the inverse β-decay cross section, and the produced visible
energy spectra in the detector.

Above the 3.4 MeV ν e energy KamLAND analysis threshold, the comparisons
of the observed no-oscillation ν e’s are listed in Table 1. There are signiﬁcant
diﬀerences in the number of detected νe’s per ﬁssion. This means that the νe
spectrum depends on the fuel component and burnup. The number of observed
events from a typical reactor core decreases by ∼ 10% from the BOC to
b = 10GWd/t. Thus when calculating the νe ﬂux, it is necessary to know
the dependence of the fuel components on the burnup. The contributions of
the isotopes to the total number of ﬁssion rates in a typical reactor core are
also listed in Table 1. It must be noted that although 238U generates a larger
number of neutrinos per ﬁssion, the contribution to the number of observed
ν e events is only ∼ 10%. The shaded regions of the neutrino spectra shown
in Fig. 1 indicate the uncertainty in the spectra. Accordingly, the uncertainty
in the total number of observed ν e’s above the 3.4 MeV energy threshold is
2.5%.

2.3 Commercial reactors in Japan

During the measurement period of KamLAND in Ref. [3] (from 9 March 2002
to 11 January 2004), 52 commercial reactors in 16 electric power stations and
a prototype reactor operated in Japan. All Japanese commercial reactors are
light water reactors (LWRs), 29 are boiling water reactors (BWRs) and 23 are
pressurized water reactors (PWRs). Both types of LWRs use 3-5% enriched
uranium fuel. Generally, reactor operation stops once a year for refueling and
regular maintenance. During the refueling, one fourth of the total nuclear fuel
is exchanged in BWRs and one third in PWRs.

To calculate production rates of reactor ¯νe’s, knowledge of the correlation be-
tween the “core thermal output” and the ﬁssion rates is required. The core
thermal output is deﬁned as the thermal energy generated in the reactor cores,
and it is calculated by measuring the heat balance of the reactor cores. The
heat taken out by the cooling water, Qfw, is the dominant dissipation source of
the reactor energy. Other contributions are less than 1%. Therefore, the uncer-
tainty of the calculated core thermal output is dominated by the accuracy of
measuring Qfw which itself is dominated by the accuracy of measuring the ﬂow
of the coolant. The accuracy of the ﬂow of the coolant in turn is determined
by the uncertainty of the feedwater ﬂowmeters, which are calibrated to within
2%. In the KamLAND experiment, a value of 2% is used as the uncertainty
of the core thermal output.

All Japanese reactors have a contribution of more than ∼ 0.1% to the total
reactor ν e ﬂux at the location of KamLAND and about half of reactors con-
tribute between 1% and 7%. Therefore, to accurately calculate the total νe
ﬂux in the KamLAND experiment, it is required to trace the time variation

5

of the ﬁssion rate of all the reactors. To calculate f isotope
reactor (t), it is necessary
to understand the burnup process of nuclear fuel. The process of burnup is
complicated and depends on the type of core, history of the burnup, initial
enrichment, fuel exchange history, etc. Detailed simulations exist that calcu-
late the change of the fuel components in accordance with the burnup. The
simulation uses the “reactor core analysis method”, which traces the burnup
eﬀect of the three-dimensional fuel component in the reactor core. Ideally,
it is desirable to perform the simulation for all the reactor cores. However,
it is practically impossible to perform such a detailed simulation for all the
commercial reactors, because it is very labor intensive. Based on the above
circumstances, we have developed a simple core modeling scheme and calcu-
lation code which can be used to calculate f isotope
reactor (t) easily without reducing
accuracy. We required that the discrepancy of the νe energy spectrum from
our simpliﬁed model be less than 1% from the detailed method. In our model,
the burnup eﬀect of the ﬁssion rate of each ﬁssile isotope in the entire core is
approximated phenomenologically using reactor operation parameters of the
nuclear reactor and calculated based on a reference reactor core. All of these
parameters have been recorded regularly by the nuclear power station, so we
can use them to calculate the ﬁssion rates without requiring additional eﬀort
from the electric power company. The details of this method are described in
the next section.

3 Fission rate calculation

3.1 Reactor core analysis

To study the burnup eﬀect of the ﬁssion rate in nuclear fuel, sample reactor
cores under actual operating conditions listed in Table 2 were analyzed with
the detailed core simulation. These reactor cores were selected to represent
typical reactor cores in Japan and the target nuclear fuel was chosen to repre-
sent typical uranium based nuclear fuel including the initial reactor operation
periods. This analysis used the Core Management System (CMS) codes from
Studsvik of America, CASMO[6]/SIMULATE[7]. This system performs core
calculations by combining “two-dimensional multi-group fuel-assembly” anal-
ysis and “three-dimensional few-group full core” analysis. These codes have
been extensively compared with measurements. The comparison [8] of the cal-
culated isotopic concentrations provided by the CMS codes with experiments
was carried out for the spent nuclear fuel discharged from a BWR type re-
actor core in Japan. The fuel pin averaged discrepancies between calculated
and measured isotopic concentrations are less than 7% for the four main ﬁssile
isotopes. According to the contributions of the ﬁssile isotopes to the number of
observed νe’s from a typical reactor core listed in Table 1, these discrepancies

of the isotopic concentrations correspond to less than ∼ 1% of the number of
observed νe’s per unit energy release.

The results of calculations of the burnup eﬀect on the relative ﬁssion rate of
each ﬁssile isotope in the BWR type reactors listed in Table 2 are shown in
Fig. 2. Hereafter, burnup will be deﬁned as the incremental burnup from the
BOC. From Fig. 2, it is clear that the dependence of burnup can be classiﬁed
in two groups: reactors in their initial fuel cycle, right after commissioning,
and reactors in their second and higher fuel cycle. Reactor cores in the initial
operation period, which starts without plutonium, are called “Initial cores”.
In the initial core, the ﬁssion rates of 239Pu increase rapidly from zero after the
BOC, and ﬁssion rates of 241Pu increase gradually following 239Pu. After a few
fuel exchanges, the burnup eﬀect in a particular operation period is indepen-

dent of the fuel cycle. This is called “Equilibrium core”. Because the burnup
eﬀect is large in initial cores and small in equilibrium cores, the dependence of
the burnup eﬀect on the nuclear fuel parameters is calculated separately for
the two cases.

3.2 Initial cores

The burnup dependence of the number of reactor νe’s between 1.0 MeV and
8.5 MeV νe energy produced in typical initial reactor cores is shown in Fig. 3.
To extract the dependence on the enrichment, a core with a high enrichment
of 3.4% is included in this comparison. As shown in Fig. 3, the number of neu-
trinos decreases with the burnup because of variation of the fuel components.
In highly enriched fuel, the speed of the decrease is slow. It can be explained
by the fact that 235U in highly enriched fuel has a larger contribution to the
total ﬁssion rate. Therefore the enrichment dependence of the burnup eﬀect
can be represented by transforming the burnup eﬀect in a speciﬁc nuclear fuel.

To study the eﬀect of fuel enrichment, we vary ǫ to ﬁrst order, substituting
ǫ0 → ǫ0 + ∆ǫ, the number of generated νe’s can be written as

N (ǫ0, b) = N (ǫ0 + ∆ǫ, b + β(ǫ0, b)∆ǫ) ,

If we know the value of β(ǫ0, b), the number of νe’s can be estimated using

Fig. 4 shows values of κ in typical reactor cores based on the burnup eﬀect

over the complete fuel cycle (Fig. 4(a)) and can be represented by a linear
function of the new fuel enrichment (Fig. 4(b)). In other words, β(ǫ0, b)/b can
be considered to be constant, and the number of νe’s is approximated as

In the present work, the value of β(ǫ0, b)/b is determined by the burnup at
the end of cycle (bEOC). The parameters for the actual reactor conditions
were obtained using the detailed core simulation, κ = 1 + 0.65∆ǫ(%) and κ =
1+0.54∆ǫ(%) for the BWR (bEOC = 10GWd/t) and PWR (bEOC = 12GWd/t)
cores, respectively.

core calculation method.

This simpliﬁed reactor core model has so far only been used to calculate the
number of ν e’s. However, the neutrino oscillation experiment requires the νe
energy spectrum. The burnup eﬀect on the νe energy spectrum reﬂects varia-
tion of the composition of the ﬁssile isotopes. We assume for the simple core
model that the ﬁssion rates of all ﬁssile isotopes have the same burnup eﬀect
as when calculating the number of νe’s. The model assigns the same correc-
tions for the new fuel enrichment to the burnup eﬀect to the ﬁssion rates. The
accuracy of this treatment is estimated in a later sub-section by comparing
the results from our model to the detailed core simulation. The systematic
uncertainty of the νe energy spectrum is also described there.

3.3 Equilibrium cores

The burnup dependence of the number of reactor ν e’s in typical equilibrium
cores with exchanged fuel volume ratio of approximately 25% is shown in Fig.
5. The relative diﬀerences of the number of ν e’s are already less than 1%
over the complete fuel cycle. To account for the inﬂuence of the new fuel, we
apply the methodology of the ﬁssion rate calculation for the initial core to the
equilibrium core. Nuclear fuel in equilibrium cores contains both new and old
fuel. The arrangement of new and old nuclear fuel rods is adjusted to burnup
equally in the reactor core. We treat the ﬁssion rate uniformly throughout the
core. Under the assumption that the ﬁssion rates of these two components do
not have locational dependence, the complete ﬁssion rate as a function of the

where Ninitial(b) is the estimated ﬁssion rate in the initial core with the fuel
enrichment of ǫ based on the reference initial core, and Nequilibrium(b) is the
estimated ﬁssion rate in the equilibrium core with the exchanged fuel volume
ratio V0 and the new fuel enrichment ǫ based on the reference equilibrium
core. Similarly to the initial core calculation, Nequilibrium(b) is obtained by
linear approximation of the burnup eﬀect in a reference equilibrium core. The
values of κ are κ = 1 + 0.35∆ǫ(%) and κ = 1 + 0.29∆ǫ(%) for the BWR
(bEOC = 10GWd/t) and PWR (bEOC = 12GWd/t) cores, respectively.

In addition to the above approximation, accumulation of ﬁssile isotopes pro-
duced by neutron absorption, particularly 241Pu produced from the U-Pu
chain, depends on the averaged absolute burnup of nuclear fuel at the BOC.

The largest discrepancy between the detailed core calculation and our simpliﬁed
calculation is for second cycle cores. In practice, this is not of a big concern as
most of the 52 commercial reactor cores are already equilibrated and the relative
diﬀerence is better than 1%.

To estimate the accuracy of our simpliﬁed calculation method, we compare
our calculations with the detailed reactor core analysis performed using pa-
rameters from commercial reactors listed in Table 2. The relative diﬀerences
in the calculated ﬁssion rates of each ﬁssile isotopes in BWR type reactors
are shown in Fig. 6. In this ﬁgure, the diﬀerence is deﬁned as (f isotope
simpliﬁed(b) −
f isotope

detailed)(b)/
ple method is less than 3%. At the same time, the relative diﬀerences in the νe

Fig. 7. Comparison of the νe energy spectrum between the detailed core calcu-
lation and our simpliﬁed calculation in BWR type reactors at the beginning of
cycle (BOC), middle of cycle (MOC) corresponding to ∼ 5GWd/t and end of cycle
(EOC). Each line is the burnup dependence of a reactor core, multiple cores are
shown; the dot-dashed red lines show initial cycle reactor cores, the dashed blue
lines show second cycle reactor cores and the solid black lines show cores from the
third cycle onwards (equilibrium cores).

energy spectra for diﬀerent values of burnup in BWR type reactors are shown
in Fig. 7. The ν e energy spectrum in the equilibrium cores agrees with the
detailed method within 1%. Because the ﬁssion rate of each isotope per unit
energy generated is balanced between the isotopes, diﬀerences in the νe energy
spectrum are suppressed. The discrepancies are large in the high energy re-
gion in a initial cycle core and second cycle cores. The maximum discrepancy
is 2.0% in a second cycle core. However, due to the large number of existing
Japanese reactors, the ν e contribution from second cycle cores is small at the
KamLAND experiment and can be neglected. The reactor νe ﬂux calculation
is well performed with an accuracy of 1% in the number of observed ν e’s in
all reactor cores, which is smaller than the uncertainty of the νe spectra and
the reactor core thermal output.

4 Summary

To calculate νe ﬂux, reactor cores can be successfully modeled using only a
few reactor operation parameters. The results of our simpliﬁed reactor model
agree with detailed reactor core simulations within 1% for diﬀerent reactor
types and burnup. This error is taken into account in the KamLAND reactor
neutrino analysis. The simpliﬁed model may be applicable to future long-
baseline reactor neutrino experiments which make use of several reactors.

ABSTRACT

Acoustic Emission (AE) data from single point turning machining are analysed in this

paper in order to gain a greater insight of the signal statistical properties for Tool Condition

Monitoring (TCM) applications. A statistical analysis of the time series data amplitude

and root mean square (RMS) value at various tool wear levels are performed, ﬁnding that

ageing features can be revealed in all cases from the observed experimental histograms.

In particular, AE data amplitudes are shown to be distributed with a power-law behaviour

above a cross-over value. An analytic model for the RMS values probability density function

(pdf) is obtained resorting to the Jaynes’ maximum entropy principle (MEp); novel technique

of constraining the modelling function under few fractional moments, instead of a greater

amount of ordinary moments, leads to well-tailored functions for experimental histograms.

I. INTRODUCTION

Due to global competition and rapidly changing customer requirements, enterprises are

required to constantly redesign their products and continuously reconﬁgure their manufac-

turing processes in terms of increasing ﬂexibility and complexity, in order to satisfy the

international market’s demands to reduce production costs and increase precision and qual-

ity. Design and development of on-line systems for monitoring the process parameters, parts

and manufacturing environment, is becoming more and more important, as the actual Sixth

Framework European Programme FP6 eﬀorts demonstrate. In this framework, main prob-

lems in the ﬁeld of metal cutting are constituted by tool wear and tool breakage. These

phenomena limit the cutting speed and feed rate, and consequently, the metal removal rates

that can be used in machining various workpiece materials in an economic way. Also, this

fact plays a negative role in the machine tool environment causing unexpected breakdowns,

defective workpieces, overloads due to high cutting forces and machine tool damages, as

well as other problems that reduce the productiveness of the machine tool. Usually, these

problems are solved using a conservative limit for the tool useful life, this leading to a less

optimum use of the tool. The complexity of such a problem has lead to an impressive

amount of literature on this subject, and a variety of techniques have been proposed. An

extended review of the state of the art, technological challenges and future developments of

these systems is described by Byrne et al.1. This paper deals in great detail on describing

the physical parameters to be analysed for industrial control applications, together with

their appropriate sensory systems. Among these, Acoustic Emission (AE) signal analysis

has been demonstrated to be one of the most eﬃcient TCM techniques which can be ap-

plied to machining processes control, as the impressive amount of literature on this subject

shows; Xiaoli’s article2 is just an example of brief review about AE methods for tool wear

3

monitoring during turning machining. Also AE source identiﬁcation and modelling, for this

particular application, is a subject in which, during the last years, a large number of studies

have been conducted, (see only as a few important examples3−6 ); Heiple et al.7 found that

the primary source of AE from single point machining is the sliding friction between the

nose and the ﬂank of the tool and the machined surface. This kind of friction is related in a

complex manner with tool wear and the material being machined; therefore, depending on

machining conditions, the RMS levels and other AE related values may increase or decrease

as the tool wears, aﬀecting the parameters of the experimental frequency distributions.

In this framework, our paper tackles the problem of gaining greater insight of the basic

statistical properties of AE signals, whose better and deeper knowledge, besides shedding

light upon this fundamental aspect of AE for this application, may greatly facilitate an

appropriate implementation of AE sensor-based devices leading to eﬃcient TCM systems.

To do this, single-point turning machining conditions, that will be described in the next

section, were held ﬁxed throughout the experiment, so as to limit the number of varying

parameters that might aﬀect the behaviour of the observed quantities. The experimental

probability density functions (pdf) of AE time series amplitude and Root Mean Squared

(RMS) values are shown for diﬀerent levels of tool wear, both these approaches being capable

of showing interesting and not yet completely exploited features. Furthermore, the eﬀects

of tool wear on such statistical properties are highlighted, thus outlining possible further

signal analysis scenarios.

An analytic model for the RMS pdf reconstruction is presented here, resorting to the

Jaynes’ maximum entropy principle (MEp) principle; the novel technique, recently pro-

posed by some of the authors, of constraining the modelling function under some fractional

moments instead of a greater amount of ordinary integer moments, leads to well-tailored

4

functions for the experimental pdf. These results are compared with previously considered

models, showing a substantial improvement in the agreement with experimental histograms.

II. DETECTORS AND EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP

To achieve the objectives of this work, simultaneous AE data acquisition has been con-

ducted by means of two diﬀerent AE sensors: a custom-built AE sensor, and a Br¨uel & Kjær

8312 AE sensor. The choice of using two diﬀerent transducers for signal pick-up not only

allows a more reliable and intensive harvest of data, but also makes it possible to perform

a compared analysis on signals gathered at the same time but at diﬀerent locations and

in diﬀerent conditions. In fact, the propagation of AE signals in the range investigated is

characterised by signiﬁcant attenuation. Thus, in order to achieve a good signal to noise

ratio, the sensor should be placed as close as possible to the machining point where the AE

signal is generated8; as an added beneﬁt, reduction of the signal distortion due to the num-

ber of interfaces and mechanical resonances is also achieved by avoiding a long measurement

chain. This motivated the use of a custom-built sensor, made of a small rectangular shaped

piezoelectric ceramic (PZT-5), 5.0 x 1.5 x 0.7 mm in size, working as a resonant sensor with

a resonance frequency near 370 kHz, housed inside a small cavity bored into the cutting tool

holder so as to protect it from chip damages and liquid coolant eﬀects, and placed about

two centimetres from the AE signal sources. An electrically conductive adhesive is used

to bond the ceramic to the internal face of the cavity. The commercial sensor is a 40 dB

pre-ampliﬁed Br¨uel & Kjaer Type 8312 AE transducer, placed at the extremity of the tool

holder by means of a special mounting, about 12 cm from the cutting area.

AE measurements were performed while machining stainless steel (AISI 303) bars on

a SAG14 GRAZIANO lathe. Cutting speeds range from 0.5 to 1 m/s, while feed rates

and cutting depths are kept constant at 0.0195 mm/turn and 2 mm respectively.

In all

5

measurements, cutting tool inserts were ”IMPERO” PCLNR with 2020/12 type tungsten

carbide; the acquisitions were performed on inserts with various degrees of wear. Speciﬁcally,

inserts were grouped into three diﬀerent wear categories: new ones, those estimated to be

half-way through their life-cycle (50%) and those completely worn through (100%).

In the new and 100% worn cases, 8 cutting edges were analyzed per wear level, while

4 edges were utilised in the 50% case. For each edge one acquisition run was conducted,

collecting 15 banks of 40, 960 AE time series point corresponding to 16.38 ms, for a total

of 614, 400 points each run. Hence, a total of 12, 288, 000 ( 4.9152 s) AE time series points

were collected over all 20 runs.

The experimental set-up is roughly sketched in Fig. 1. The signals detected by the

transducers were ampliﬁed (by means of a 40 dB Analog Module preampliﬁer for the custom

sensor, its own 40 dB preampliﬁer for the Br¨uel & Kjaer one), and ﬁltered in the 200 −

1000 kHz range through a Krohn-Hite 3944 ﬁlter. The signals were then captured by a

Tektronix digital oscilloscope (TDS420) using a 2.5 MHz sampling rate, and ﬁnally stored in

a PC through an IEEE488 interface. Blank measurements performed just prior to machining

indicated no signiﬁcant electrical noise. The data were analysed both directly in their time

series form and through Root Mean Squared (RMS) values.

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Time series analysis

Typical time splice series for the two sensors are shown in Fig. 2. In both cases two rather

well distinct parts can be identiﬁed: a continuous part that is characterised by a relatively

constant amplitude with small ﬂuctuations, and a burst emission exhibiting strong inter-

mittence and relatively high amplitudes. The former is associated with plastic deformation

and frictional processes during the cutting operations, the latest with chip breakage as well

6

with micro-cracks and dislocation kinetics9,3.

For the two sensors, the histograms of the absolute value of time series amplitudes, a,

taken from measurements performed using inserts in three stages of wear are portrayed in

Fig. 3. All these experimental frequency distributions p(a) are normalised over the related

number of data and grouped into 126 classes.

It is possible to observe how in all cases

the curves exhibit a power-law behaviour p(a) = Aa−α + B above a cross-over value from

a nearly ﬂat distribution, the value of the slope being slightly dependent on the sensor

used (α = −3.7 and α = −3.9 for custom-built and Br¨uel & Kjaer sensors, respectively),

but similar for all three stages of wear. The corresponding exponents for the energy E are

α′ = −2.35 and α′ = −2.45, as they can be derived from the amplitude exponents assuming

E ∝ a2.

acoustic emission.

For both sensors, data from tools with greater wear level show within the power-law

range a slightly smaller frequency count for a given value in amplitude; this leads to the

conclusion that, in this set of trials, the newer tools are the most active ones in terms of

It is interesting to note that power-law behaviour, strongly suggestive of a critical dy-

namics associated with this particular AE phenomena, has been observed in many studies

on acoustic emission signals, e.g. those related with the formation of micro-fractures10,11,? .

In general, power-law characteristics are associated with scale invariant properties under-

lying the physical phenomena under study, and in some cases this has been explained by

Self-Organised Criticality (SOC)13 models.

B. Root mean squared analysis

A substantial eﬀort in the past has been dedicated towards analysing the relationship

between signal RMS and tool wear level in various experimental situations, e.g. see14 for

7

identifying catastrophic tool failure (CTF) conditions in carbide inserts. The analysis of the

RMS were conducted calculating values on the basis of 100 points, corresponding to 40 ms,

this choice being eﬀective in making the RMS signal sensitive to the diﬀerent contributions

from burst and continuous events. In order to study the RMS values statistical properties,

also as a function of ageing, their experimental frequency distributions were analysed by

grouping the values into 60 bins, after their normalisation over the largest values of the

entire RMS data set. For each wear level, and for both the sensors utilised, the average

histograms are shown in Fig. 4. For increasing levels of wear the curves show a noticeable

shift towards lower levels of the modal value of the frequency distribution, as well a change

in the skewness tending towards values compatible with a symmetrical shape, these features

being particularly evident for Br¨uel & Kjaer sensor. In order to test the diﬀerence among

these graphs, T-Test analyses regarding the sample means were performed, which indicate

that the null hypothesis of equal means can be rejected with a conﬁdence level of 95%. This

approach appears to be eﬀective in discriminating tool wear features, and could be used as

the basis for implementing algorithms for TCM applications.

In literature, borrowing from a technique used in the description of surfaces roughness

by Whitehouse15, various attempts have been made at determining tool condition relying

on the hypothesis that a Beta distribution f (x) (see for example16,14) properly describes the

Probability Density Function pdf of the RMS values,

where β is the complete Beta function:

f (x) =

xr−1(1 − x)s−1
β(r, s)

,

β(r, s) =

xr−1(1 − x)s−1dx.

0

Z

8

(1)

(2)

With this assumption it is possible to characterize the moments of the distribution in terms

of the two parameters r and s, and vice-versa. In particular, as far as mean (µ) and variance

(σ2) are concerned, we have:

r =

s =

µ
σ2 (µ − µ2 − σ2)
1 − µ
σ2

(µ − µ2 − σ2).

(3)

Thus, values for r and s can be estimated on the basis of the mean and variance of the

data set. Past studies have shown that r,s pairs are scattered in diﬀerent ways, depending

on tool conditions16. One shortcoming of this method is that no estimate of the errors on

the r and s parameters is directly available; this is particularly serious as real-life signals

often contain outliers which can bring a noticeable shift in the actual values of both mean

and variance. One possibility is to use more robust estimators (e.g. median instead of mean)

although this still does not give an error estimate for the calculated parameters. A further

choice is to perform a non-linear best-ﬁt on the data set using the function given in Eq.

(1)17.

In Fig. 5 the best-ﬁt of the experimental frequency distributions from custom-built sensor

data as in Fig. 4 are shown. From these graphs it is possible to see that while there is a

good matching between the ﬁtting function and the data sets in the neighbourhood of the

peaks, some discrepancies are visible in the residual for RMS bin values just above the

peak where the curves level oﬀ; this indicates that in this range, the data sets are richer

in events than what Eq.

(1) would indicate, and this suggests that a better empirical

ﬁtting-function may exist. In Fig. 6 r,s estimates from Eqs. (3) are compared to the ones

obtained by the best-ﬁtting process. It is evident that the two groups greatly diﬀer and that

these discrepancies are not compatible considering the error estimates given on the ﬁtted

9

parameters. Furthermore, the scattering pattern of these two groups are entirely diﬀerent;

whereas both the best-ﬁtted r,s parameters tend to increase with wear, the estimated ones

show an essentially opposite behavior. One possible explanation for this diﬀerence is that

while the best-ﬁt process minimises mean-square diﬀerences between the ﬁtting function and

the frequency distribution (so that heavily populated bins are weighted more), the estimate

method relies on µ and σ2. Variance, in particular, is highly sensitive to outliers, so values

far from the mean weigh heavily on its determination.

In this framework, a method is proposed here to reconstruct the approximate RMS’s pdf

by applying the ME technique, under the constraint of some fractional moments, the latter

ones being explicitly obtained in terms of given ordinary moments. Such approach allows

to obtain well-tailored ﬁtting functions for the experimental curves.

C. Recovering RMS’s pdf from fractional moments

Jaynes’ maximum entropy principle (MEp) says that ”the best (minimally prejudiced) as-

signement of probabilites is that one which minimises the entropy subject to the satisfaction

of the constraints imposed by the available information”18. Thus, taking the Kullback-Leibler

information functional or diﬀerential entropy (KL, in the following) as the relevant informa-

tion measure, the spirit of Jaynes’ principle implies that the best probability assignement

fM (x) is the solution of the following minimization problem:

min KL(f, f0) = min

f (x) ln

f (x)
f0(x)

dx,

ZD

(4)

subject to the satisfaction of the following requirements:

i) f (x) ≥ 0, ∀x ∈ D;

ii)

D f (x) dx = 1;

R

iii) Ik(f (x)) = 0, k = 1, 2, . . . , M;

10

where f0(x) is the ”prior distribution” of X and {Ik(f (x)) = 0, k = 1, 2, . . . , M} is a set

of relations representing the information available on the distribution whose f (x) is the

density.

In other words Jaynes’ prescription is to take the best probability assignement

fM (x) as close as possible to the prior distribution f0(x) without however contraddicting

the available physical information as summarized by the constraints Ik and the general

requirements of any legitimate density function. Usually,

Ik(f (x)) = µk −

xk f (x) dx, k = 1, 2, . . . , M,

(5)

ZD

where µk represents the k-th integral moment of the population having f (x) as pdf. If

the population moments are unknown, it is possible to replace them with their sample

counterparts19. But, it should be clear that integral moments are not the unique choice.

In fact, when the underlying random variable takes positive values, Novi Inverardi and

Tagliani20 proposed the use of fractional moments

˜µαk =: E(X αk) =

xαk f (x)dx, αk ∈ IR, k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , M, ˜µ0 = 1,

ZD

to represent the available information in the set of constraints given in Eq. (5) to spend

for recovering the unknown pdf. With this setup, the solution of (4) which gives back the

Jaynes’ MEp model,

fM (x; αk, λk) = exp{−

λk xαk }.

(6)

M

k=0
X

The parameter M, unknown when the available information consists only in a sample,

represents the order of the model given by the Jaynes’ MEp and the λk, k = 1, 2, . . . , M,

are the Lagrangian multipliers associated with the physical constraints Ik(f (x)).

The main reason that asks for the choice of fractional moments rests on the fact that

integral moments could be very poor tool to extract information from a sample when the

corresponding distribution exhibits fat tails or the characterizing moments are not integral.

11

In the last case, giving the fractional moments a better approximation of the characterizing

moments, the performance of the reconstruction density procedure based on them is expected

to be reasonably better than that based on integral moments.

When the only information available consists in a sample, the Jaynes’ MEp needs to

be combined with the Akaike selection approach to obtain a complete procedure for the

reconstruction of the underlying unknown pdf:

in fact Jaynes’ MEp produces an inﬁnite

hierarchy of ME models and Akaike’s approach permits to select the optimal member from

the hierarchy of models given by MEp.

It is clear from Eq. (6) that when constraints involve fractional moments there is an

additional problem to solve: being the exponents αk of fractional moments new variables to

take into account, it needs to decide not only how many but also what fractional moments to

choose in such a way that the estimated density reﬂects properly the information contained

in a given sample about the unknown probability distribution. Both of these choices rest

on the exploiting of diﬀerential entropy contribution or in other terms choose the M α’s

exponents and the M λ’s coeﬃcients which minimize the KL distance between f (x) and

fM (x); it means the solution of the following optimization problem:

n represents the sample diﬀerential M-order model en-

tropy. The term M/n is proportional to the model order M, i.e. to the number of parameters

which we try to estimate using a given sample, and inversely proportional to the size n of

the sample and can be interpreted in the Akaike’s philosophy as a ”penalty term” which

prevents us from establishing ”too elaborate” models which cannot be justiﬁed by the given

data. Consequently, the parsimony principle becomes an important criterion whereby we

attempt to retain only relevant and useful information and discard the redundant part of it.

More details on the estimation procedure can be found in Novi Inverardi and Tagliani20.

The above technique is applied here to recover from AE’s values the analytic form of

the RMS’s pdf that are solution of Eq. (7) and that represent a well-tailored model for

experimental data distributions. Fig.7 shows, for the three levels of tool wear previously

considered, the results of RMS values pdf recovering by the ME technique, using only 5

fractional moments. Curves are compared with the experimental histograms showing a

good agreement, especially for newer tools curves, and the visual inspection of entropy

values related to the approximating functions indicates it decreases whit increasing tool

wear level, this representing a possible further indicator for the phenomena evolution.

CONCLUSIONS.

Various ways of analysing the basic statistical properties of AE signals in a TCM appli-

cation have been illustrated, in which machining conditions were held ﬁxed throughout the

experiment, in order to limit the number of varying parameters that might aﬀect the be-

haviour of the observed quantities. The analysis has been performed on signals gathered at

the same time using two diﬀerent AE sensors, enabling a comparative analysis in which, for

both sensors, some interesting features, till now not suﬃciently underlined, have emerged.

In particular, both AE time series and their associated RMS values experimental frequency

distributions have been derived, allowing to analyse how tool wear aﬀects such statistical

features in the kind of situations investigated in our experiment. For what concerns the

RMS values, the shape of the curves indicates a noticeable shift towards lower levels of the

modal value for increasing levels of wear, this indicating a reduced AE activity, together to

a reduction in the signal variability and a change in the skewness towards values compatible

with a symmetrical shape.

A Beta function model for describing the RMS’s pdf has been tested, and the residuals

13

in the best-ﬁtted function indicate that a more appropriate ﬁtting model should be sought.

A much better agreement has been reached by resorting to a ME technique by means of

which the general Hausdorﬀ moment problem has been tackled in an original way by using

only few sampling fractional moments, this providing a better tailored analytic form for

the RMS’s experimental distributions than previously proposed models. It has been also

observed that the entropy of the functions monotonically changes for wear increasing. On

the other hand, the physical meaning of the Lagrange multipliers λj obtained in this ﬁtting

function reconstruction, (or the equivalent fractional moments order αj) is not clear, and

future eﬀorts should be done to clarify this aspect.

Particularly interesting are the statistical properties of the time series, in which power

laws in the frequency distributions have been identiﬁed, in accordance with what has been

pointed as a feature of acoustic emission phenomena in numerous other ﬁelds. In particu-

lar, the evidence of the non-gaussianity of the process would make it reasonable to tackle

the signal blind deconvolution problem by means of higher order statistics (HOS)21. The

recovering, only from the observed output, of the unknown original signal before it had been

altered by the sensor response and the measurement chain, would be a fundamental step

towards a deeper understanding of AE phenomena associated to TCM and more general

applications as well.

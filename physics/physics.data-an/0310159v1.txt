Abstract

For the characterization of surface height proﬁles we present a new
stochastic approach which is based on the theory of Markov processes.
With this analysis we achieve a characterization of the complexity of the
surface roughness by means of a Fokker-Planck or Langevin equation,
providing the complete stochastic information of multiscale joint proba-
bilities. The method was applied to diﬀerent road surface proﬁles which
were measured with high resolution. Evidence of Markov properties is
shown. Estimations for the parameters of the Fokker-Planck equation are
based on pure, parameter free data analysis.

1 Introduction

The complexity of rough surfaces is subject of a large variety of investigations in
diﬀerent ﬁelds of science [1, 2, 3, 4]. Physical and chemical properties of surfaces
and interfaces are to a signiﬁcant degree determined by their topographic struc-
ture. As one example, the inﬂuence of surface roughness on boundary layer ﬂows
is discussed in turbulence research (cf. [5, 6]) and in the atmospheric (cf. [7, 8])
and oceanographic sciences (cf. [9]). A comprehensive characterization of the
topography is of vital interest for deposited, polished or otherwise processed sur-
faces. Therefore, to give a second example, current roughness analysis methods
ﬁnd practical application for the characterization of polished surfaces [10,11,12].
In the context of industrial and engineerig applications common roughness
measures are based on standardized procedures as the maximum height diﬀer-
ence Rz and the mean value of absolute heights Ra [13]. These rather simple
measures clearly cannot completely characterize the complexity of roughness.
This is also conﬁrmed by the existence of a large amount of additional measures,
each describing a very special feature of a surface.

In the physical and other sciences a common local measure of roughness is
, where h(˜x) is the measured

the rms surface width wr(x) = h(h(˜x) − ¯h)2i1/2

r

height at point ˜x, h · ir denotes the average over an interval of length r around
the selected point x, and ¯h the mean value of h(˜x) in that interval. Advantages of
wr(x) are a scale dependent deﬁnition as well as clear physical and stochastical
meanings. Among the techniques used to characterize scale dependent surface
roughness probably the most prominent ones are the concepts of self-aﬃnity
and multi-aﬃnity, where the multi-aﬃne f (α) spectrum has been regarded as
the most complete characterization of a surface [14, 15, 2, 3]. From a stochastic
point of view we want to point out two important properties of multiaﬃnity:
r i ∼ rξα , and (b)
(a) the ensemble average hwri must obey a scaling law hwα
the statistics of wr(x) are investigated on distinct length scales, thus possible
correlations between wr(x) and wr′(x) on diﬀerent scales r, r′ are not examined.
The method we are proposing in this contribution is based on stochastic
processes which should grasp the scale dependency of surface roughness in a
most general way. No scaling feature is explicitly required, and especially the
correlations between diﬀerent scales r and r′ are investigated. To this end we
present a systematic procedure how the explicit form of a stochastic process
for the r-evolution of a roughness measure similar to wr(x) can be extracted
directly from the measured surface topography. This stochastic approach has
turned out to be a promising tool also for other systems with scale dependent
complexity like turbulence [16,17] and ﬁnancial data [18]. In this letter we focus
on the complexity of rough surfaces. As a specialized example we have picked
out the applied problem of characterizing road surfaces. These are an essential
component of current transportation and thus represent a class of non-idealized
and widely used surfaces. We claim that the applicability of our method to this
class of surfaces indicates its general relevance for improved surface characteri-
zation.

A collection of road surface data was measured which served previously as
an empirical basis for the prediction of vibrational stress on bicycle riders [19].
It is common to describe the quality of a road surface by a power law ﬁt to the
power spectrum of the height proﬁle [20,21,22]. This method is not appropriate
especially for wavelengths below 0.3 m and for non-Gaussian height distribu-
tions. Furthermore, the power spectrum characterizes only the r-dependence
of one moment of the two-point correlations [23]. While some improvements to
this method have been proposed [24] the characterization of road surfaces still
remains incomplete [25, 26]. For the improvement of road surface characteriza-
tion multifractality and multiaﬃnity seem not to be appropriate tools because
scaling is no constant feature of road surfaces.

In the remainder of this letter we ﬁrst introduce our method, the determi-
nation of a Fokker-Planck equation for the evolution of conditional probability
density functions (pdf) directly from experimental data. Next, we present a
typical data set, show evidence of its Markov properties, and estimate the coef-
ﬁcients of the Fokker-Planck equation. At last, we evaluate the precision of the
estimated coeﬃcients by numerical reconstruction of conditional and uncondi-
tional pdfs.

2 Method

It is one common procedure to characterize the complexity of a rough surface
by the statistics of the height increment [27]

hr(x) := h(x + r/2) − h(x − r/2)

(1)

depending on the length scale r, as marked in ﬁg. 1. Other scale dependent
roughness measures can, for example, be found in [15,3]. Here we use the height
increment hr because it is also directly linked to vehicle vibrations induced by
the road surface if r is the wheelbase. Another argument for the use of hr
is that its moments are connected with spatial correlation functions, but it
should be pointed out that our method presented in the following could be
easily generalized to any scale dependent measure, e.g. the above-mentioned
wr(x). As a new ansatz, hr will be regarded here as a stochastic variable in
r. Without loss of generality we consider the process as being directed from
larger to smaller scales. Our interest is the investigation how surface roughness
is linked between diﬀerent length scales.

Complete information about the stochastic process would be available by the
knowledge of all possible n-point, or more precisely n-scale, probability density
functions (pdf) p(h1, r1; h2, r2; . . . ; hn, rn) describing the probability of ﬁnding
simultaneously the increments h1 on the scale r1, h2 on the scale r2, and so
forth up to hn on the scale rn. Here we use the notation hi(x) = hri(x), see (1).
Without loss of generality we take r1 < r2 < . . . < rn. As a ﬁrst question one
has to ask for a suitable simpliﬁcation. In any case the n-scale joint pdf can be
expressed by multiconditional pdf

p(h1, r1; . . . ; hn, rn) = p(h1, r1|h2, r2; . . . ; hn, rn) · p(h2, r2|h3, r3; . . . ; hn, rn)
(2)

· . . . · p(hn−1, rn−1|hn, rn) · p(hn, rn)

where p(hi, ri|hj, rj) denotes a conditional probability, which is deﬁned as the
probability of ﬁnding the increment hi on the scale ri under the condition that
simultaneously, i.e. at the same location x, on a larger scale rj the value hj was
found. An important simpliﬁcation arises if

p(hi, ri|hi+1, ri+1; . . . ; hn, rn) = p(hi, ri|hi+1, ri+1) .

(3)

This property is the deﬁning feature of a Markov process evolving from ri+1 to
ri. Thus for a Markov process the n-scale joint pdf factorize into n conditional
pdf

p(h1, r1; . . . ; hn, rn) = p(h1, r1 |h2, r2) · . . . · p(hn−1, rn−1 |hn, rn) · p(hn, rn) . (4)

This Markov property implies that the r-dependence of hr can be regarded as
a stochastic process evolving in r, driven by deterministic and random forces.
If additionally the included noise is Gaussian distributed, the process can be
described by a Fokker-Planck equation [28]. For our height proﬁles it takes the

p(hr, r|h0, r0) =

p(hr, r|h0, r0) .

(5)
The Fokker-Planck equation then describes the evolution of the conditional
probability density function from larger to smaller length scales and thus also
the complete n-scale statistics. The minus sign on the left side of eq. (5) ex-
presses this direction of the process, furthermore the factor r corresponds to
a logarithmic variable ρ = ln r which leads to simpliﬁed results in the case of
scaling behaviour [29].

The term D(1)(hr, r) is commonly denoted as drift term, describing the
deterministic part of the process, and D(2)(hr, r) as diﬀusion term being the
variance of a Gaussian, δ-correlated noise. Focus of our analysis is to show
evidence of the above mentioned Markov property and to derive the drift and
diﬀusion coeﬃcients D(1) and D(2) in eq. (5) from experimental data.

Height proﬁles were measured from numerous road and cycle track surfaces
typical for West German bicycle traﬃc. Road sections were selected in such a
way that stationarity is given. Proﬁle length is typically 20 m or 19 000 samples,
respectively. Longitudinal resolution was 1.04 mm and vertical error smaller
than 0.5 mm. As an example we present results from a data set of an irregular
cobblestone road consisting of ten proﬁles with a total of about 190 000 sam-
ples [30]. Figure 1 shows a short section of the data. In ﬁg. 2 the power spectral
density of the height proﬁles is plotted against the wavenumber. Scaling be-
haviour is not found at the beginning of the analysed region of length scales,

while for smaller scales (20 < k/ m−1 < 100) it appears to be present. In the
following, the height increments are normalized by σ∞ := limr→∞hh2
ri1/2, with
σ∞ = 6.3 mm for the given data set.

4 Markov Properties

For a Markov process the deﬁning feature is that the n-point conditional proba-
bility distributions are equal to the single conditional probabilities, according to
eq. (3). With the given amount of data points the veriﬁcation of this condition
is only possible for n = 3 and for r1 < r2 < r3 < 300 mm.

with p(h1, r1|h2, r2) as dashed lines and p(h1, r1|h2, r2; h3, r3) as circles.

Figure 3 shows both sides of eq. (3) with n = 3 in a contour plot and two
cuts at h2 ≈ ±σ∞. The value of h3 was chosen to be h3 = 0. We take this rather
good correspondence as a strong hint for a Markov process. Markov properties
were found for scale distances from about 17 mm upwards. Note that the main
axis of the distribution is tilted, indicating that p(h1, r1|h2, r2) 6= p(h1, r1) and
thus height increments on diﬀerent scales are not independent.

5 Estimation of Drift and Diﬀusion Coeﬃcients

In order to obtain the drift (D(1)) and diﬀusion coeﬃcient (D(2)) for eq. (5) we
proceed in a well deﬁned way like it was already expressed by Kolmogorov [31],
see also [28, 16]. First, the conditional moments M (k)(hr, r, ∆r) for ﬁnite step
sizes ∆r are directly estimated from the data via moments of the conditional
probabilities

M (k)(hr, r, ∆r) =

(˜h − hr)k p(˜h, r − ∆r|hr, r) d˜h .

Parameterizations are shown as solid and broken lines. a) Drift coeﬃcient
D(1)(hr, r). b) Diﬀusion coeﬃcient D(2)(hr, r).

Figure 4 shows estimations of the drift coeﬃcient D(1) and the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient D(2) for r = 188 mm. The error bars are estimated from the errors
of M (1) and M (2) via the number of events contributing to each value. The
limit ∆r → 0 was performed in both cases by a linear ﬁt to M (k)(hr, r, ∆r)
in the range 17 mm ≤ ∆r ≤ 29 mm. Both coeﬃcients were parameterized
as piecewise linear functions where the behaviour within |hr| ≤ 2.5σ∞ could be
derived directly from the above estimations. Outside this range increasing errors
make a precise estimate more diﬃcult. Parameterizations were chosen here
to additionally obtain good results in the veriﬁcation procedures (see below).
Figure 4 shows that the resulting parameterizations are in good agreement with
the estimations. It is easy to verify that with linear D(1) and constant D(2) the
Fokker-Planck equation (5) describes a Gaussian process, while with a parabolic
D(2) the distributions become non-Gaussian, also called intermittent or heavy
tailed.

In our case, here, D(1)(hr, r) is characterized by the slope −γ(r) within
|hr| ≤ 2.5σ∞, −4γ(r) for hr < −2.5σ∞, and −2γ(r) for hr > 2.5σ∞ (compare
ﬁg. 4). The dependence of γ on r is nontrivial with the value ranging from
0.82 for r = 83 mm to 1.9 for r = 188 mm. D(2)(hr, r) was found to have a
value β(r) independent of hr within |hr| ≤ 2.5σ∞. For hr < −2.5σ∞ D(2) was
parameterized to be linear with slope −4β(r), for hr > 2.5σ∞ with slope 3β(r).
The dependence of β on r can be approximated by β(r) = 0.0117 r/mm.

6 Veriﬁcation of Coeﬃcients

Next, we want to evaluate the precision of our result. Therefore we return to
eq. (5). Knowing D(1) and D(2) it should be possible to calculate the pdf of hr

with the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation. Equation (5) can be integrated
over h0 and is then valid also for the unconditional pdf. Now the empirical pdf
at r0 = 188 mm is parameterized (see ﬁg. 5) and used as initial condition for
a numerical solution of the integrated form of eq. (5). For several values of r
the reconstructed pdf is compared to the respective empirical pdf, as shown in
ﬁg. 5. Please note that the interchange of steeper and ﬂatter regions in the
reconstructed pdf is achieved by the piecewise linear parameterization of D(1)
and D(2).

A second veriﬁcation is the reconstruction of conditional pdf by direct nu-
merical solution of the Fokker-Planck equation (5). An example for the scales
r0 = 188 mm and r1 = 131 mm is shown in ﬁg. 6. Reconstructing the condi-
tional pdf this way is much more sensitive to deviations in D(1) and D(2). This
becomes evident by the fact that the conditional pdf (and not the unconditional
pdf of ﬁg. 5) determine D(1) and D(2) (see (6) and (7)). Here also the diﬀer-
ence to the multiscaling analysis becomes clear, which analyses higher moments

7 Conclusions

The height increment hr of surface height proﬁles as a stochastic variable in
r can be correctly described by a Fokker-Planck equation with drift and diﬀu-
sion coeﬃcients derived directly from measured data. The results of the pre-
sented example support the hypothesis that the noise term in the evolution
of the stochastic variable hr in r is suﬃciently well described by a Gaussian,
δ-correlated random process.

As the Fokker-Planck equation describes the evolution of p(hr, r | h0, r0) and
p(hr, r) with r, it covers also the behaviour of the moments hhn
r i including any
possible scaling behaviour. From the integrated form of eq. (5) an equation for
the moments can be obtained by multiplying with hn
r and integrating over hr.
For D(1) being purely linear in hr and D(2) purely quadratic, multifractal scaling
is obtained. We note again that, compared to scaling features, the knowledge of
the Fokker-Planck equation provides more information on the complexity of the
surface roughness in the sense of multi-scale joint probability density functions,
eq. (2), which correspond to multipoint statistics. While to this end we do
not seem to ﬁnd universal laws concerning rough structures, we do achieve a
comprehensive characterization of a speciﬁc surface, showing the strength and
generality of this method.

At last we want to point out that the Fokker-Planck equation (5) corresponds
to an equivalent Langevin equation [28]. The use of this Langevin equation in
the scale variable should open the possibility to directly simulate surface proﬁles
with given stochastic properties for diﬀerent applications.

When the process direction is reversed, the coeﬃcients D(k) change only slightly,

does not mean a principal drawback of the proposed analysis.

2nd February 2008

Abstract

The miltifractal properties and scaling behaviour of the exchange
rate variations of the Iranian rial against the US dollar from a daily
perspective is numerically investigated. For this purpose the multifrac-
tal detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (MF-DFA) is used. Through mul-
tifractal analysis, the scaling exponents, generalized Hurst exponents,
generalized fractal dimensions and singularity spectrum are derived.
Moreover, contribution of two major sources of multifractality, that is,
fat-tailed probability distributions and nonlinear temporal correlations
are studied.

Keywords: Multifractality, Scaling, Rial-dollar exchange rate, Financial

markets.

Introduction

For more than two decades, there has been considerable interest in the in-
vestigation of the scaling behaviour on fractal models. The pioneering work
[1] on fractals introduced the concept of fractals and showed some rela-
tion between self-similar fractals and self-aﬃne fractals. Self-aﬃne fractals
[2, 3, 4, 5] constitute random and complicated structure and have been
applied to a broader range of problems, such as the Eden and ballistic
deposition model [6, 7, 8, 9] , mountain heights, clouds, coast lines, and
cracks. Among other examples of many fractal models, the self-avoiding
random walk, random resistor, polymer bonds, turbulences, chaotic mo-
tions can be mentioned [2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13] , etc. Specially, the real
data from diﬀerent ﬁnancial markets show apparent multifractal properties
[14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. Moreover,recently, ﬁnancial analysis of

foreign exchanges has became one of the outstanding topics in econophysics
[23]. Many of these researches apply multifractal analysis framework as
a basic framework.
In universal multifractal framework, the statistics of
the data are fully described with some parameters, taking into account two
complementary aspects of ﬁnancial time series: the multiple scaling and the
Pareto probability distributions, which is a generic feature of multifractal
processes [24].
It has been shown that there are two main factors leading to multifractal be-
haviour of ﬁnancial time series, nonlinear time correlations between present
and past events and the heavy-tailed probability distributions of functions.
Based on ref. [21] , for the stocks, the main contribution to multifractality
comes from a broad distribution of returns while a long memory present
in this kind of data contributes only marginally. It should be noted that
the nature of correlations leading to the multifractal dynamics of the varia-
tions is strongly nonlinear and, curiously, cannot be simply related to some
well-known correlation type like a slowly decreasing volatility autocorrela-
tion with an imposed daily pattern. For example, one even has to consider
the nonlinear dependencies in the volatility itself in order to reveal how the
temporal correlations contribute to multifractality in the stock market and
foreign exchange data.
In this paper, the rial-dollar exchange rate data is studied with the focus
on their fractal properties. The multifractal detrended ﬂuctuation analysis
is applied which is a well-established method of detecting scaling behaviour
of time series.
In Section 1, theoretical backgrounds including MFDFA
method, sources of multifractality, multifractality ﬁnger prints and strength
of multifractality are reviewed. Data are described in Section 2. Numerical
results are presented in Section 3 and ﬁnally, conclusions are given in Section
4.

2 Theoretical backgrounds

2.1 Method

Detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) is a scaling analysis technique pro-
viding a simple quantitative parameter-the scaling exponent α-to represent
the correlation properties of a time series [25]. The advantage of DFA over
many techniques are that it permits the detection of long-range correlations
embedded in seemingly non-stationary time series, and also avoids the spu-
rious detection of apparent long-range correlations that are an artifact of
non-stationarity. Additionally, the advantages of DFA in computation of H
over other techniques (for example, the Fourier transform) are:

• inherent trends are avoided at all time scales;

2

• local correlations can be easily probed.

To implement the DFA, let us suppose there is a time series, N (i)(i =

1, ..., Nmax). The time series N (i) is integrated:

where:

y(j) =

[N (i) − hN i]

j

X
i=1

hN i =

N (i).

1
Nmax

Nmax

X
j=1

Next N (i) is broken up into K non-overlapping time intervals, In, of equal
size τ where n = 0, 1, ...K − 1 and K corresponds to the integer part of
Nmax/τ . In each box, the integrated time series is ﬁtted by using a poly-
nomial function, ypol(i), which is called the local trend. For order-l DFA
(DFA-1 if l=1, DFA-2 if l=2, etc.), the l-order polynomial function should
be applied for the ﬁtting. The integrated time series y(i) is detrended in
each box, and calculated the detrended ﬂuctuation function:

For a given box size s, the root mean square ﬂuctuation is calculated:

Y (i) = y(i) − ypol(i).

F (s) =

1
Nmax

v
u
u
t

Nmax

X
i=1

[Y (i)]2

The above computation is repeated for box sizes s (diﬀerent scales) to pro-
vide a relationship between F (s) and s. A power law relation between F (s)
and s indicates the presence of scaling: F (s) ∼ sα. The parameter α,
called the scaling exponent or correlation exponent, represents the corre-
lation properties of the signal:
if α = 0.5, there is no correlation and the
signal is an uncorrelated signal [25]; if α < 0.5, the signal is anticorrelated; if
α > 0.5, there are positive correlations in the signal. In the two latest cases,
the signal can be well approximated by the fractional Brownian motion law
[26].
For a further characterization of data it is meaningful to extend Eq. (15) by
considering the more general ﬂuctuation functions [27]. Simply, it is achieved
by averaging over all boxes to obtain the qth order ﬂuctuation function

Fq(s) = [

(F 2(s))q/2]1/q,

1
2Nmax

Nmax

X
i=1

where, in general, the index variable q can take any real values except
zero. If the analyzed signal develops fractal properties, the ﬂuctuation func-
tion reveals power-law scaling

for large s. The scaling exponents h(q) can be then obtained by observing the
slope of log-log plots of Fq vs.s. The family of the exponents h(q) describe
the scaling of the qth order ﬂuctuation function. For positive values of q, h(q)
exponents describe the scaling behaviour of boxes with large ﬂuctuations
while those of negative values of q, describe scaling behaviour of boxes with
small ﬂuctuations [28]. For stationary time series, the exponent h(2) is
identical to the Hurst exponent. Thus the exponents h(q) are called as the
generalized Hurst exponents [28]. For monofractal time series which are
characterized by a single exponent over all scales, h(q) is independent of q,
whereas for a multifractal time series, h(q) varies with q. This dependence
is considered to be a characteristic property of multifractal processes [28].
The h(q) obtained from MF-DFA is related to the Renyi exponent τ (q) by

qh(q) = τ (q) + 1.

(7)

Therefore, another way to characterize a multifractal series is the singularity
spectrum f (α) deﬁned by [26]

′
α = h(q) + qh

(q),

f (α) = q[α − h(q)] + 1,

(8)
where h′(q) stands for the derivative of h(q) with respect to q. α is the H¨older
exponent or singularity strength which characterizes the singularities in a
time series. The singularity spectrum f (α) describes the singularity content
of the time series. Finally, it must be noted that h(q) is diﬀerent from the
generalized multifractal dimensions

D(q) ≡

τ (q)
q − 1

=

qh(q) − 1
q − 1

,

(9)

that are used instead of τ (q) in some papers. While h(q) is independent of
q for a monofractal time series with compact support, D(q) depends on q in
that case.

2.2 Sources of multifractality

Generally, there are two diﬀerent types of sources for multifractality in time
series: (i) due to diﬀerent long-range temporal correlations for small and
large ﬂuctuations, and (ii) due to fat-tailed probability distributions of vari-
ations. Both of them need a multitude of scaling exponents for small and
large ﬂuctuations. Two procedure is followed to ﬁnd the contributions of
two sources of multifractality and to indicate the multifractality strength:
(i) shuﬄing, and (ii) phase randomization. Shuﬄing procedure preserves
the distribution of the variations but destroys any temporal correlations. In
fact, one can destroy the temporal correlations by randomly shuﬄing the
corresponding time series of variations. What then remains are data with
exactly the same ﬂuctuation distributions but without memory.The shuﬄing
procedure consists of the following steps

4

(i) Generate pairs (p, q) of random integer numbers (with p, q ≤ N ) where

N is the total length of the time series to be shuﬄed.

(ii) Swap entries p and q.

(iii) Repeat two above steps for 20N times. (This step ensures that order-

ing of entries in the time series is fully shuﬄed.)

In order to study the contribution of the fat-tailed variations on the multi-
fractality, the surrogate data are used. In fact, the non-Gaussianity of the
distributions can be weakened by creating the phase-randomized surrogates
[29]. The Phase randomization steps are:

(i) Take discrete Fourier transform of time series.

(ii) Multiply the discrete Fourier transform of the data by random phases.

(iii) Perform an inverse Fourier transform to create a phase randomized

surrogates.

Phase randomization preserves the amplitudes of the Fourier transform but
randomizing the Fourier phases. This procedure eliminates nonlinearities,
preserving only the linear properties of the original time series [30].

2.3 Multifractality ﬁnger prints

One can see that in the whole q-range the generalized Hurst exponents h(q)
can be ﬁtted well by the formula

h(q) =

−

1
q

ln[aq + bq]
qln2

(10)

which corresponds to τ (q) = −ln[aq +bq]/ln2 . This formula can be obtained
from a generalized binomial multifractal model [31]. Instead of choosing a
and b, the Hurst exponent h(1) and the persistence exponent h(2) could be
chosen. From knowledge of two moments, all the other momemts follow.
Here the formula is used only to show that the inﬁnite number of expo-
nents h(q) can be described by only two independent parameters, a and b.
These two parameters can then be regarded as multifractal ﬁnger prints for
a considered time series.

2.4 Strength of multifractality

In the generalized binomial multifractal model, the strength of the multi-
fractality of a time series can be characterized by the diﬀerence between the

5

maximum and minimum values of α, αmax − αmin. When q dh(q)
zero for q approaching ±∞, then △α = αmax − αmin is simply given by

dq approaches

△α = h(−∞) − h(∞) =

(11)

ln(b) − ln(a)
ln2

.

It must be noted that this parameter is identical to the width of the singu-
larity spectrum f (α) at f = 0. The wider singularity spectrum the richer
multifractality.

3 Data Analysis

The data which is analyzed are the time series of the daily closing exchange
rate logarithmic variations (that is, ln(P(t))/ ln(P(t+1)) for the time period
24th September 1989, to 15th November 2003. So that our database con-
sists of 4369 exchange rates and 4368 daily variations. The sources of this
data is the central bank of the islamic republic of Iran. In Fig. 1 a time
series corresponding to daily values of the Iranian rial-US dollar exchange
rates in mentioned period is presented. A great increment in dollar price is
seen about 16th May 1995 because of Iranian government decision on lift-
ing the ban on foreign exchanges price variations. The Iranian government
has managed to keep the exchange rate stable at around 8000 rials per US
dollar ever since March 2000. Also, Table 1 provides summary statistics of
logarithmic variations of exchange rates. According to data in Table 1, a

negatively large skew is seen. The probability distribution function of varia-
tions also show a high degree of peakedness and fat tails relative to a normal
distribution. Thus there is a clear departure from Gaussian normality. The
departure from a Gaussian Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) can be
clearly seen in Fig. 2, where the CDF of variations against a Gaussian CDF
is depicted.

4 Results

The ﬂuctuation functions Fq(s) for timescales ranging from 3 days to N /5
are calculated, where N is the total length of the time series, and for q
varying between -10 and 10, with a step of 0.5. Fig. 3 shows the MF-DFA2

6

ﬂuctuations Fq(s) for various q’s.
A crossover with great magnitude (like as a phase transition) in ﬂuctuation
function is seen for negative q values in the range 30 < s < 65. The position
of crossover doesn’t have sensitivity to decreasing or increasing q values.
The only interest behaviour is the asymptotic behaviour of Fq(s) at large
times s. One can clearly observe that above the crossover region, the Fq(s)
functions are straight lines in the double logarithmic plot, and the slopes
increase slightly when going from high positive moments towards high neg-
ative moments (from the top to the bottom in Fig. 3).
For the sake of better studying the large ﬂuctuations, randomized data (
both of reshuﬄed and surrogate data) have been used. Fig. 4 indicates
that, the magnitude of change in crossover for reshuﬄed data is very large
relative to the surrogate data. In fact, one can say that such an eﬀect origi-
nates mainly from temporal correlations. Moreover, the position of crossover
is intended to left (about s ≃ 4) because of randomizing .
Monofractal time series are associated with a linear plot τ (q), while multi-
fractal ones possess the spectra nonlinear in q. The highest nonlinearity of
the spectrums, the strongest multifractality in time series. Calculations in-
dicate that the time series of exchange rate variations can be of multifractal
nature. In order to visualize the scaling character of the data, in Fig. 5, the
corresponding multifractal spectra is shown. Fig. 5 shows three examples of
τ (q) for the original (solid), surrogate (dotted) and reshuﬄed (dashed) data.
The nonlinearity of τ (q),s is much weaker for the modiﬁed time series than
for the original ones. Additionally, surrogate data show less nonlinearity
based on Fig. 5 and therefore, their contribution to multiscaling relative to
reshuﬄed data is less.
The h(q) spectra has been ﬁtted in the range −10 ≤ q ≤ 10 for original,
reshuﬄed and surrogate series by Eq.
(10). Representative example for
original series is shown in Fig. 6. The dotted line in Fig. 6 is obtained by
best ﬁts of h(q) by Eq. (10). The respective parameters a and b for original,
reshuﬄed and surrogate series are listed in Table 2. It is notable that in
each single case, the q dependence of h(q) for positive and negtive values of
q can be characterized very well by the two parameters, and all ﬁts remain
within the error bars of the h(q) values.

It is seen that the strength of multifractality in rial-dollar exchange rate
variations is very powerful. Moreover, multifractalty strength in randomized
data decreases specially in surrogate data based on values in Table 2.
In order to visualizing and better understanding the strength of multifrac-
tality for original, reshuﬄed and surrogate data, the singularity spectrum of
series are shown in Fig. 7. Both the widths of the f (α) spectra in each ran-
domized data are much smaller than for the original one. This behaviour of
the reshuﬄed time series conﬁrms that the persistent autocorrelations play
an important role in multiscaling of the price variations. But, The spectra
for the surrogates are typically much narrower than for the reshuﬄed data
which can be interpreted as an evidence of the inﬂuence of extremely large
non-Gaussian events on the fractal properties of the time series.

5 Conclusions

The multifractal properties of the Iranian rial-US dollar exchange rate log-
arithmic variations has been studied in this paper through multifractal de-
trended ﬂuctuation analysis. It is shown that the time series for exchange
rate variations exhibit the characteristics that can be interpreted in terms
of multifractality. Its degree expressed by e.g. the widths of the singularity
spectra f (α) indicate a strong multifractality. Moreover, although the most
multifractality of the exchange rate variations data is due to diﬀerent long-
range correlations for small and large ﬂuctuations, the shape of the proba-
bility distribution function also contributes to the multifractal behaviour of
the time series.

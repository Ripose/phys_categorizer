Abstract

Global wireless networks enable mobile users to communicate regardless of their locations.

Location management is an important part of the emerging wireless and mobile technology.

A Personal Communication System (PCS) network must have an eﬃcient way to keep track

of the mobile users to deliver services eﬀectively. Global System for Mobile Communication

(GSM) is a commonly accepted standard for mobility management of mobile users. Lo-

cation management involves location tracking, and location information storage. Location

management requires mobile users to register at various registration areas whenever they

are on the move. The registration process may cause excessive signaling traﬃc and long

forwarding schemes have been proposed in the past. In this paper, we propose a new Two

Level Single Chain Pointer Forwarding (TLSCP) Strategy in which a two level hi-

Organizing the pointers in a two level hierarchy and further restricting the pointer chain

lengths at both the levels to single chain localizes the network signaling traﬃc and reduces

the call set up delays. To justify the eﬀectiveness of our proposed strategy, we develop an

analytical model to evaluate the signaling cost. Our performance analysis shows that the

proposed dynamic TLSCP scheme can signiﬁcantly reduce the network signaling traﬃc and

cost for diﬀerent categories of users under diﬀerent network conditions

INTRODUCTION

The phenomenal growth in cellular telephony over the past several years has demonstrated

the vitality of mobile communication for users on the move [1]. Infact, in a decade of it’s

existence, the number of mobile phone owners in Delhi is greater than the number of people

who own land line phones. If this is true for a developing country, it maybe safe to assume the

same for urban areas of developed countries. One reason for mobile usage gaining popularity

is the rapid fall in it’s cost. Along with the competition in the electronics industry driving

the hardware cost down, improvement in strategies to locate a mobile user and transferring

the calls have led to reduction in operational cost. Location management is an important

part of the emerging wireless mobile communication system [2]. A network must retain

information about location of users in the network in order to route traﬃc to the correct

destination. Location Management has two components:

• Location tracking, and

• Location information storage.

Location tracking mechanisms may be perceived as updating and querying a location

database of users to determine when and how a change in location database entry should

3

be initiated. Location information storage mechanisms help in organizing and maintaining

the location database. Location tracking typically consists of two operations:

• (i) updating (or Registration), the process by which a mobile user initiates a change

in the location database according to its new location, and

• (ii) Finding (or Paging), the process by which the network initiates a query for a

mobile user location (which may also result in an update to the location database).

Two popular and very similar schemes for mobility management are EIA/TIA Interim Stan-

dard IS-41 [3] and GSM Mobile application Part (MAP) [4, 5]. However both these schemes

use a two tier system of a Home Location Register (HLR) and a Visitor Location Register

(VLR) databases and share the same location update procedure. The service area is divided

into several registration areas. When a user subscribes to the service, a record or a proﬁle

of the user is kept in the HLR, a register located close to the Mobile Switching Center

(MSC). When the mobile host moves to a new location or out of the coverage of this MSC,

it informs the VLR in the new area and a temporary record is created in the VLR. The

VLR sends a registration message to the HLR, which in turn responds with necessary user

information. When a call arrives for the mobile user, HLR is queried which in turn submits

a query to the current VLR for the current rout-able address of the mobile host. According

to these strategies [4, 5], a mobile user performs location update (registration) at the HLR

every time the user crosses the boundary of a Registration area (RA) and De-registers at the

previous VLR. Thus, the registration process incurs high signaling traﬃc when many users

cross their RAs. This problem worsens with increase in the number of users and when many

users are far away from their HLR. To overcome this problem, location tracking techniques

should use a combination of updating and ﬁnding in an eﬀort to select the best trade-oﬀ

between update overhead and delay incurred in ﬁnding the host. A trade-oﬀ also needs

to be analyzed between the update and paging costs [6]. The network signaling traﬃc is

also dependent on the geographical location of the HLR databases as it aﬀects both latency

and overhead when location information is processed [1]. Both of these factors need to be

minimized as they aﬀect the network performance. Distributed HLRs in several areas can

4

prevent the HLR from becoming a bottleneck in signaling network. The latency can be

reduced by using replicated databases where location information is kept at several places

in the network. Such user proﬁle replication can reduce HLR access. The amount of sig-

naling traﬃc may increase slightly as a change in location information after a move must

be initiated in all to modify all replications. Various location management strategies for

reducing the location management cost have been proposed in the last decade [7]-[15]. The

diﬀerent proposed strategies have been analyzed using diﬀerent mathematical and analytical

models [16]-[18]. Diﬀerent mobility models [16] have been taken into account to evaluate the

performance of these schemes. In random mobility models, a mobile user is likely to move to

any one of the neighboring cells, where as, in the activity based models the various activities

of the users for classiﬁcation are taken into account to decide the updating process. Simple

Markov models have been utilized to assess and compare the performance characteristics of

the ’Degradable location management scheme’ [18] using the IS-41 protocol, the Forwarding

and Resetting algorithm [11], the Paging and Location Update Algorithm [16] and the Local

Anchor Scheme [12]. The proposed ’Local Anchor (LA) scheme’ [12] and ’Per user pointer

forwarding scheme’ [16] avoid expensive HLR updates and access each time a mobile user

moves to a new registration area (RA). However, the LA scheme [12] has the drawback of

increased local signaling traﬃc whereas the Per-user pointer forwarding [16] scheme suﬀers

a long set-up delay for highly mobile users. An eﬃcient ’Two Level Pointer Forwarding

(TLPF) Strategy’ was proposed by Ma and Fang [15], in which a two level mobility manage-

ment was introduced by selecting a set of VLRs as Mobility Agents responsible for location

management in geographically larger area compared to the RA of the VLR. Two kinds of

pointers were used between the VLRs and MAs. Registration signaling traﬃc was localized

and thus the network signaling traﬃc was considerably reduced. The performance analysis

of TLPF strategy showed signiﬁcant reduction in the network signaling traﬃc for users with

low Call to mobility (CMR) with slight increase in the call set-up delay. To overcome the

network signaling and call setup delay problems, we proposed a ’Two Level Single Chain

Pointer Forwarding (TLSCP) strategy’ [19, 20].

5

Similar to the TLPF strategy of Ma [15], in the presently proposed TLSCP strategy, a

two level hierarchy of level-1 and level-2 forwarding pointers has been used. However, in

the proposed strategy, the pointer chain length of both level-1 and level-2 pointers chains

has always been adjusted and reduced to single chain. Organizing the pointers in a two

level hierarchy and further restricting the pointer chain lengths at both levels to single chain

reduces the network signaling traﬃc and call set-up delays. We have further combined

the concept of two level single chain hierarchy with choice of replicated HLRs distributed

throughout the geographic region. The use of forwarding pointers makes the concept of

distributed HLRs more attractive and eﬃcient. This makes the proposed-TLSCP Strategy

an eﬃcient and attractive scheme for location management of mobiles. In the present paper,

we have done the modeling and performance analysis of the TLSCP scheme using an analytic

model. We have also made a performance comparison of the proposed scheme with the Basic

GSM [4, 5] and the TLPF strategy proposed be Ma and Fang [15]. In the next section,

we describe the basic architecture of the distribution of VLRs and HLRs assumed in the

proposed TLSCP strategy to facilitate the presentation and analysis of the strategy. Section

III gives the pseudo-code of the Basic GSM strategy and the proposed TLSCP strategy.

In section IV, we present an analytic model of the performance of the TLSCP strategy.

Comparison of the performance of TLSCP strategy has been made with the performance of

TLPF strategy [15] as well as the basic GSM scheme and the results have been summarized

in section V. Finally in Section VI we present the conclusion and the future scope of our

work.

II. TWO LEVEL SINGLE CHAIN LOCATION POINTER (TLSCP)

MANAGEMENT STRATEGY

The proposed TLSCP scheme is based on PCS architecture. The whole geographic area is

divided into a number of sub areas. There are a number of registration areas (RAs) in each

sub-area. Each RA has a VLR database maintaining the records of all mobile users present

in the RA. We have proposed to dedicate one centrally located VLR in each sub-area to act

6

as Mobility Agent (MA), responsible for location management of all the mobile users present

in the RAs lying in the coverage area of that MA. A hexagonal network coverage model [12]

for VLRs has been assumed in which Visitor Location Registers (VLRs) are arranged in

rings around the centrally located MA. Thus each MA covers an n-layer VLR structure and

would be responsible for location management in a large area. We have proposed a replicated

and distributed HLR environment throughout the geographic region. Each distributed HLR

maintains one record for an authorized mobile Each HLR is located at the site of Public

Switching Telephone Network (PSTN). This oﬀers an advantage that when an incoming call

is originated from some remote PSTN, the HLR would be queried directly and Global Title

Translation (GTT) would not be required because the distributed HLR is near the Signaling

Transfer Point (STP) [21].

MA

FIG. 1: A geographical region is divided into numerous hexagonal area called registration area

(RA). Various RAs are bought together (example shaded 19 hexas) and a centrally located VLR

is assigned the role of mobility agent (MA).

As mentioned earlier, each distributed HLR has one record for an authorized mobile

7

user. This record contains the individual MA-id where the mobile was found last time by

an individual HLR. Diﬀerent HLRs may record diﬀerent MAs/ sub-areas as the head of

their own locating paths. So, each HLR may have a diﬀerent locating path for the same

mobile. Thus one cellular system with x distributed HLRs may have y diﬀerent locating

pointer chains (where y≤x) for the same mobile user. Further, as a mobile user moves from

one RA to another, a level-2 pointer chain is set up between VLRs of diﬀerent RAs and

further a level-1 pointer chain is set up between MAs if the new RA lies in the coverage

area of another MA. The lengths of both level-1 and level-2 pointer chains are adjusted and

reduced to single length between MAs and VLRs respectively. This constraint is always true

regardless of the HLR from which an incoming call originates. Based on this characteristic,

the proposed scheme is called as, ’Two level single chain pointer forwarding strategy’ for

location tracking in a distributed HLR environment.

III. OPERATIONS DEFINED IN TLSCP SCHEME

The two basic procedures in location management of mobile users are

• Move( )- Deﬁnes movement of mobile user from one Registration Area (RA) to another.

• Locate( )- Determines the location of RA where the user is currently located.

The pseudo-code for the two basic operations deﬁned for the GSM and the proposed

TLSCP strategy are as follows [19]

GSM MOVE( )

{

}

The mobile terminal detects that it is in a new registration area;

The mobile terminal sends a registration message to the user’s HLR;

The HLR sends a registration cancellation message to the old VLR;

The old VLR sends a cancellation conﬁrmation message to the HLR;

The HLR sends a registration conﬁrmation message to the new VLR;

{

}

{

{

}

{

ELSE

8

GSM LOCATE( )

Call to a PCS user is detected at the local switch;

If the called party is in the same RA, then return;

Switch queries the called party’s HLR;

HLR queries the called party’s current VLR, V;

VLR, V returns the called party’s location to HLR;

HLR returns the location to the calling party;

The pseudo-codes for the TLSCP Move() and Locate() procedures are given below

TLSCP-MOVE( )

IF NEW-VLR and OLD-VLR both belong to same MA.

NEW-VLR deregisters the user OLD-VLR.

OLD- VLR sends Acknowledgement-signal to NEW-VLR.

OLD-VLR sets up a level-2- pointer to NEW-VLR.

TLSCP-LOCATE ( )

A call to a user is detected at a PSTN switch;

PSTN queries the user’s HLR.

HLR queries the MA at the head of its locating chain.

MA queries the VLR pointed by the pointer VLR-PTR in its data entry;

IF VLR-PTR=NULL

MA forwards call-request to Next-MA in level-1 MA pointer chain;

MA forwards call request to the VLR pointed by VLR-PTR.

VLR locates the user tracking through the level-2 pointer chain.

User’s current-VLR sends a rout-able address of user to the MA.

MA forwards the rout-able address of user to HLR and PSTN switch.

PSTN transfers the call to the user.

HLR updates the user’s location in its database to current-LN.

{

{

{

}

}

The detailed protocol of the proposed TLSCP strategy as represented by the pseudo

code guarantees that not more than one of each level-1 and level-2 forwarding pointers will

be traced to locate a mobile user regardless of the remote PSTN where an incoming call

originates. The users have been classiﬁed into diﬀerent classes according to their Call-to-

Mobility Ratio (CMR). The CMR of a user is deﬁned as the expected number of calls for a

user during the time the user visits an RA, where CMR is deﬁned here in terms of the calls

received by the user and not the calls originating from the user. Let

10

(1)

• λ be the mean rate at which calls are received by a user.

• 1/µ be the mean time for which a user resides in a given RA.

Then, CMR represented by ’p’

p =

λ
µ

Assume that the user crosses several RAs between two consecutive calls. If the Basic Strategy

is used, the HLR is updated every time the user moves to a new RA. On the other hand

if ’Two level single chain pointer forwarding strategy’ proposed in the paper is used, the

HLR is updated only at the rate at which a user receives calls. So, HLR is updated λ times

irrespective of the number of moves made by the user. For all the moves if the calls are not

received only level-1 and level-2 pointer chains are set up and their lengths are adjusted.

Consider the case in basic mobile telephony, as a mobile user moves he registers himself

in the RA he is present in. The RA updates the MA (several RAs are clustered and are

ascribed under one MA, shaded region of ﬁg 1.) about the residency of the user. For routing

a incoming call to the mobile, the mobile is traced by a pointer pointing between the MA

and the RA. Consider ﬁg 2, if the user is in RA labeled V1, a pointer would exist between

MA and V1. A movement into neighboring RA would result in a new pointer being created

between MA and say V2. This creation of pointer is accompanied by various signal transfers

between the MA and RA, creating large signal traﬃc at MA. To over come this problem

Ho et al [12] proposed that a RA acts as a Local Anchor (LA) and any movement within

a MA would only result in updating of the LA, thus cutting down the signal traﬃc to the

MA. However, this is at the expense of longer pointers to locate an user. For example if a

mobile user goes from V1 (with V1 acting as the LA) to V2 then V3 (see ﬁg 2), three pointers

would exist, namely MA → V1−2 → V2−3. While this cuts down the traﬃc of signals to the

MA, in locating a mobile user to connect his call, it would be necessary to traverse the long

path MA → V1−2 → V2−3. In view of the models advantages Ma et al [15] improved upon

the model to cut down cost. They achieved their objective by changing the local anchor

(LA) after the pointer reached a critical length. The scheme was called ”Two Level Pointer

Forwarding Strategy (TLPFS)”.

FIG. 2: Level-2 pointer formation within a MA after one and two steps, respectively.

In this present model (TLSCP), we propose the formation of a resultant (as in vector)

pointer with every step to a neighboring RA. This reduces the length of the pointer as also

number of pointer to be traversed while locating a mobile to transfer a call (now only two

pointers have to be traced). This is at an obvious additional cost of creation of resultant

pointers. For example consider the case shown in ﬁg 2. After the ﬁrst step, the pointer for

locating a user would be MA → V1−2 which after the second step would be updated as MA

The following section makes the performance analysis of this (TLSCP) strategy. The

utility and in-turn the success of this TLSCP strategy can only be estimated by such an

analysis.

IV. PERFORMANCE

In the following section, we analyze the performance of TLSCP strategy for mobile

technology along the lines of Ma and Fang’s works [15]. At the end, we compare the

performance of this strategy with their Two-level pointer forwarding strategy. For this

we adopt the same notations of their work with the notations having the same meanings.

Adopting these notations as standard would help in performance analysis of all possible

proposed strategies. However, for brevity and easy reference we detail the notations and

their respective meanings here,

α(i) = the probability that there are ’i’ VLR crossings between two consecu-

tive calls.

S1 = the cost of setting up a level 1 pointer between two neighboring MAs.

S2 = the cost of setting up a level 2 pointer between two neighboring VLAs.

A MA is formed by ’n’ closely packed hexagonal RA’s. As a mobile user moving from

one RA to another, in a single step, there is a deﬁnite possibility of the user crossing over

from one MA to another. While cross-over from one MA to another MA leads to a creation

of a new ”level-1 pointer”, cases where such cross-over does not take place, the mobile user

is only roaming in one of the various RA’s of a given MA. This activity initiates formation

of ”level-2 pointers”. The probability of remaining in a given MA after one step movement

is given as

Thus, the probability of cross-over, and in-turn formation of level-1 pointer, is given as

P2 =

3n2 − 5n + 2
3n2 − 3n + 1

3n2 − 5n + 2
3n2 − 3n + 1

P1 = 1 − P2 = 1 −

=

2n − 1
3n2 − 3n + 1

j = i × P2 = i

3n2 − 5n + 2
3n2 − 3n + 1 !

 

k = i × P1 = i

2n − 1
3n2 − 3n + 1 (cid:19)

(cid:18)

If the mobile user takes ’i’ steps, the number of steps taken within an MA (j) and the number

of steps leading to crossing of MA boundaries (k) are

and

12

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

respectively. With the knowledge of the probabilities and the total steps taken between two

calls, one only needs an idea of the path the user undertakes to calculate the cost due to

moving from one RA to another and position movement between MAs. Though such paths

would purely be random, one can specify all possible paths and generalize for an estimation

of cost. This is what we propose to do in the following section.

13

A. Cost due to Move

1. Cost due to movement within MA

Each Basic Move costs the service provider. The general expression for the cost involved

in level-2 pointer formation covers the new VLR visited by the user communicating to the old

VLR for informing the users new position. This action is also accompanied by De-registration

signal and acknowledgment signal between all the VLRs the user has occupied since the

last call. Thus, with each step cost is incurred due to the associated De-registration and

acknowledgement. The cost incurred would increase with increasing length of the resultant.

Assume a single step movement to the neighboring VLR results in formation of a pointer

(vector) whose length is R1 and represents the cost of pointer formation. For the ﬁrst step,

this would be the resultant itself. To estimate the cost incurred as a user moves, we assigned

the cost as S2 (i.e. the cost incurred on setting pointer R1 is S2). When the mobile user takes

a second step (see ﬁg 2b) another pointer R1 is set representing the step taken to neighboring

VLR (V2). As per our scheme, a sequence of signalling results giving rise to single chain

pointer Rm. Again the cost incurred in setting up this pointer would be proportional to it’s

length. The length of the resultant pointer formed would be given as

Rm =

R2

m−1 + S2

2 − 2S2Rm−1cosθ

(6)

where θ is the angle enclosed between the pointer of the latest step (R1) and the previous

of steps. The curve showing the cost for circular and radially outward motion encloses all

possible paths. Curve (b) shows cost for a randomized motion (user takes random θ with

each step. This curve was numerically stimulated). As expected this curve lies between the

limiting cases of circular and radially outward motion. Using eqn(6) and eqn(7) it can be

seen that the cost involved in setting up level-2 pointer in case a user is moving in circle

around the originating VLR is related to the number of steps taken (j) and is given as

A similar neat expression is obtained for the user moving radially outward and is given as

Since cost incurred by a random motion would lie between curves represented by these two

curves, one can expect a quadratic expression for estimating the cost incurred in pointer

formation (level-2) due to any random motion after ’j’ steps as

= (2j − 1)R1

= (0.5j2 + 1.5j − 1)R1

= (aj2 + bj − 1)R1
= (ai2P 2

2 + biP2 − 1)S2

where simple algebra shows that since curve (b) is constraint to lie between curve (a) and (d)

the coeﬃcient ’a’ can take only values between zero and 1/2 and the coeﬃcient ’b’ should

have values between 1.5 and 2 besides satisfying the condition a+b=2. A polynomial of

higher order was not selected for simplifying calculations as also to retain some generality

of expression.

2. Cost due to movement outside MA

As the user moves out of a MA, signals of registration and De-registration are sent between

the new VLR and the previously occupied VLR. Recognizing the new VLR to be existing

outside it, the original MA sends information to the original HLR. The original HLR sets a

level-1 pointer between itself and the HLR associated with the new MA. The level-1 pointer

is also setup between the new HLR and new MA. Thus, with every movement outside a

MA, two level-1 pointers are set. Thus, k steps outside the MA would result in 2k level-1

pointers being set, which would cost

= 2kS1

(9)

where S1 is the cost involved in setting a level-1 pointer.

Figure 5 shows the variation in the expected cost on a MOVE action with ’p’, the CMR.

The ﬁgure shows three cases for diﬀerent values of P2, the probability of the user moves

within the same MA. As expected, the cost is less for the situation where chances of cross-

over is less. This is also evident from the slope of the curves. Notice that the curves of each

set intersect, however at diﬀerent values of ’p’. The curves of ﬁg 3 also intersected at j=1

and the point physically represented the mobile user’s ﬁrst step. The physical signiﬁcance

of ’j’ is distributed to ’p’ via P2 in our mathematics. Hence, any interpretation of the curves

of ﬁg 5 should be from the point of intersection and towards p=0. Decreasing value of ’p’

represents increasing steps taken by the user or in other words increasing mobility.

FIG. 6: Two possible methods that pointer would be used for locate (Tracking).

The locate activity of the service provider only takes place when a call is made. Since

the level-2 pointer is always being updated to the shortest length (between VLR occupied

at time of last call and the latest VLR occupied, irrespective of however many steps were

taken), there are only two possible scenarios for locating a user in this model (see ﬁg 6).

The average cost incurred in tracing a user would hence be given as

(F′/F) on these parameters. The variations are self explanatory. However, the important
point to be noted from ﬁg 7 is the strong inﬂuence of κ (in turn S1) and S2 have on F′/F.

Figure 8 shows the variation of the total cost incurred in the location management for the

proposed TLSCP scheme as compared to the basic operation mode. Figure 8(I) shows that

with increase in σ, the cost of location management decreases. This is a direct result of

decrease in location tracking cost (T = S/σ, see ﬁg 6). However, as seen from ﬁg 8(II), the

cost of location management depends more strongly on κ’s value, where a lower κ implies

that the cost of location updating (setting of level-1 pointers) decreases. Also notice the

larger section of curves lieing below (CF/CB=) 1 on decreasing κ. This region (CF/CB ≤ 1)

indicates region of operation where TLSCP scheme works out to be cheaper than the basic

operation scheme. Thus, even for an increased mobility (low p), the cost of operation in

TLSCP scheme can be made low by decreasing the value of σ and κ.

FIG. 9: Performance analysis of TLSCP strategy w.r.t. Ma and Fang’s [15] strategy.

V. DISCUSSION

The analysis of the TLSCP strategy shows that despite the increase of localized signal

traﬃc generated in a MA, the cost involved in locating a user is low. This eﬀectively brings

down the cost of operation for users with low call to mobility ratio. Eﬃcient programming to

bring down the cost in setting up level-1 pointers (making κ low) would enable the operator to

expand the limit of ”the low call to mobility ratio”. Proﬁling a user and eﬃciently switching

from TLSCP strategy to TLPF (Two Level Pointer Forwarding [15]) strategy would bring

down the cost of operation signiﬁcantly. Figure 9 compares the costing of the two strategies.

This in principle should be easy due to the broad similarity in the two strategies.

VI. CONCLUSION

23

The present article proposes a Two level single chain pointer forwarding strategy for

location management. When a mobile user moves from one RA to another, it is accompanied

by a pointer formation between a local anchor (which is an RA the user occupied when he

last received a call) and the new RA in which the user is located. An increase in cost of

MOVE action (various signals exchanged between RA’s and computer information updating)

drastically reduces the cost involved in tracing (Locating) an user to transfer a call. If the

cost incurred in forming a level-2 pointer, i.e. S2 can be reduced by minimizing signal

transfers required to update computer information, the total cost for location updating and

location tracking (CF) would be reduced. This would bring down the operating cost of the

service provider. In the present model since a MA can manage larger RA’s in it, increasing

number of RA’s under a MA decreases the probability of user crossing over MA’s. This again

strongly contributes to the decrease in operating cost. The present strategy (TLSCP) out

performs the basic strategy. However, it only betters Ma and Fang (TLPFS)[15] strategy

for low mobility. The model fails in decreasing cost for a user with large mobility. It would

be interesting to investigate an algorithm in future works, that switches from TLSCP model

to TLPFS as an increase in user mobility is detected.

Based on the assumption that the residency time of a user in a RA follows Gamma

Distribution, Ma and Fang[15] derived an expression for α(i), given as

α(i) =

[gi−1(1 − g)2]
p

= Agi

(24)

’g’ is the Laplace transform of the Gamma Distribution function. The constant ’A’ and the

nature of ’g’ can be evaluated by subjecting it to the conditions given by eq(12), i.e.

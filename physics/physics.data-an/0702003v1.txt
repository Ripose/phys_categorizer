Abstract— We evaluate the average waiting time between
observing the price of ﬁnancial markets and the next price
change, especially in an on-line foreign exchange trading service
for individual customers via the internet. Basic technical idea
of our present work is dependent on the so-called renewal-
the
reward theorem. Assuming that stochastic processes of
market price changes could be regarded as a renewal process,
we use the theorem to calculate the average waiting time of
the process. In the conventional derivation of the theorem, it is
apparently hard to evaluate the higher order moments of the
waiting time. To overcome this type of difﬁculties, we attempt to
derive the waiting time distribution Ω(s) directly for arbitrary
time interval distribution (ﬁrst passage time distribution) of the
stochastic process PW (τ ) and observation time distribution PO(t)
of customers. Our analysis enables us to evaluate not only the
ﬁrst moment (the average waiting time) but also any order of the
higher moments of the waiting time. Moreover, in our formalism,
it is possible to model the observation of the price on the internet
by the customers in terms of the observation time distribution
PO(t). We apply our analysis to the stochastic process of the
on-line foreign exchange rate for individual customers from the
Sony bank and compare the moments with the empirical data
analysis.

I. INTRODUCTION

Fluctuation has an important role in lots of phenomena
appearing in our real world. For instance, a kind of magnetic
alloy possesses magnetism in low temperature, whereas in
high temperature, it
losses the magnetism due to thermal
ﬂuctuation acting on each spin (a tiny magnet in atomic scale
length). Thus, the large system undergoes a phase transition
at some critical temperature and the transition occurs due
to cooperative behavior of huge number of spins, to put it
other way, due to competition between thermal ﬂuctuation and
exchange interaction between spin pairs making them point to
the same direction [1].

To understand these kinds of macroscopic properties or
collective behavior of the system from the microscopic point
of view, statistical mechanics provides a good tool. Actually,
statistical mechanics has been applied to various research
subjects in which ﬂuctuation is an essential key point, such
as information processing [2] or economics including ﬁnan-
cial markets and game theory [3]. Especially, application of
statistical-mechanical
tools to economics, data analysis of
ﬁnancial markets — what we call econophysics — is one of
the most developing research ﬁelds [4], [5], [6]. Financial data

have attracted a lot of attentions of physicists as informative
materials to investigate the macroscopic behavior of the mar-
kets from the microscopic statistical properties [4], [5], [6].
Some of these studies are restricted to the stochastic variables
of the price changes (returns) and most of them is speciﬁed
by a key word, that is to say, fat tails of the distributions [4].
However, the distribution of time intervals also might have
important information about the markets and it is worth while
for us to investigate these properties extensively [7], [8], [9],
[10], [11], [12].

Such kinds of ﬂuctuation in time intervals between events
are not special phenomena in price changes in ﬁnancial
markets but very common in science. In fact, it is well-known
that spike train of a single neuron in real brain is time series
in which the difference between successive two spikes is not
constant but ﬂuctuated. This stochastic process speciﬁed by the
so-called Inter-Spike Intervals (ISI) is one of such examples
[13], [14]. The average of the ISI is about a few milli-second
and the distribution of the intervals is well-described by the
Gamma distribution [14].
On the other hand,

in ﬁnancial markets, for instance,
the time intervals of two consecutive transactions of BUND
futures (BUND is the German word for bond) and BTP
futures (BTP is the middle and long term Italian Government
bonds with ﬁxed interest rates) traded at LIFFE (LIFFE
stands for London International Financial Futures and Options
Exchange) are ∼ 10 seconds and are well-ﬁtted by the so-
called Mittag-Lefﬂer function [8], [9], [10]. The Mittag-Lefﬂer
function behaves as a stretched exponential distribution for
short time interval regime, whereas for the long time interval
regime, the function has a power-law tails. Thus, the behavior
of the distribution described by the Mittag-Lefﬂer function is
changed from the stretched exponential to the power-law at
some critical point [15]. However, it is non-trivial to conﬁrm
if the Mittag-Lefﬂer function supports any other kind of market
data, for example,
the market data ﬁltered by some rate
window.

As such market data, the Sony bank USD/JPY exchange rate
[16], which is the rate for individual customers of the Sony
bank in their on-line foreign exchange trading service, is a
good example to be checked by the Mittag-Lefﬂer function.
Actually, our preliminary results imply that the Mittag-Lefﬂer

function does not support the Sony bank rate [17]. The Sony
bank rate has ∼ 20 minutes [18] as the average time interval
which is extremely longer than the other market rate as the
BUND future. This is because the Sony back rate can be
regarded as the so-called ﬁrst passage process [19], [20],
[21], [22], [23], [24] of the raw market data. In Table I, we
list the average time intervals and the probability distribution
function (PDF) that describes the data with ﬂuctuation between
the events for typical three examples, namely, the ISI, the
BUND future and the Sony bank rate. From this table, an
important question might be arisen. Namely, how long do the
customers of the Sony bank should wait between observing
the price and the next price change? This type of question
is never occurred in the case of the ISI or the BUND future
because the average time intervals are too short to evaluate
such informative measure.

Obviously, for the customers, an important (relevant) quan-
tity is sometimes a waiting time rather than a time interval
between the rate changes. The waiting time we mentioned here
is deﬁned by the time for the customers to wait until the next
price change since they try to observe it on the World Wide
Web for example [16]. If the sequence of the time intervals
has some correlations and the customers observe the rate at
random on the time axis, the distribution of the waiting time
is no longer identical to the distribution of the time intervals.
In the previous studies [25], [26], [27], we assumed that the
time intervals of the Sony bank USD/JPY exchange rates
might follow a Weibull distribution and evaluated the average
waiting time by means of the renewal-reward theorem [28],
[29]. However, the conventional renewal-reward theorem is
restricted to the case in which the customers observe the rate
at random on the time axis and it is hard to extend the theorem
to the situation in which the time for the customers to observe
the rates obeys some arbitrary distributions.

To make these problems and difﬁculties clear, in this paper,
we introduce a different way from the renewal-reward theorem
to evaluate the higher-order moments of the waiting time
for arbitrary time interval distribution of the price changes
and observation time distribution by directly deriving the
waiting time distribution. We ﬁrst show that the result of
the renewal-reward theorem [27] is recovered from our new
formalism. Then, it becomes clear that our formulation is more
general than the conventional renewal-reward theorem. As an
advantage of our approach over the renewal-reward theorem,
we can evaluate the higher-order moments of the waiting
time, and moreover, it becomes possible to consider various
situations in which the customers observe the rate according
to arbitrary distribution of time.

This paper is organized as follows. In the next section II,

we introduce the Sony bank rate [16] which is generated from
the high-frequency foreign exchange market rate via the rate
window with width 2ǫ yen (ǫ = 0.1 yen for the Sony bank).
In section III, we summarize a series of our previous studies
related to the present paper. To understand the mechanism of
the Sony bank rates as the ﬁrst passage process [19], [20] of
the raw market rate, in section IV, we carry out the computer
simulations by making use of the GARCH (Generalized Au-
toRegressive Conditional Heteroscedasicity) model [30], [31],
[32] with discrete returns as the time series behind the Sony
bank rates. The effect of the rate window on the currency
exchange rates is revealed. In the next section V, we explain
our method to derive the waiting time distributions. We show
that our treatment reproduces the result by the renewal-reward
theorem. We also evaluate the deviation around the average
waiting time for the Weibull ﬁrst passage time distribution
and uniform observation time distribution. We ﬁnd that the
resultant standard deviation is the same order as the average
waiting time. We test our analysis for several cases of the
observation time distributions and calculate the higher-order
moments. The last section VI is concluding remarks.

II. THE SONY BANK RATES AS A FIRST PASSAGE PROCESS

The Sony bank rate (see Fig. 1) we shall deal with in this
paper is the rate for individual customers of the Sony bank
[16] in their on-line foreign exchange trading service via the
internet. If the USD/JPY market rate changes by greater or

equal to 0.1 yen, the Sony bank USD/JPY exchange rate is
updated to the market rate. In this sense, the Sony bank rate
can be regarded as a kind of ﬁrst passage processes [19],
[20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. In Fig. 2, we show the mechanism
of generating the Sony bank rate from the market rate (This
process is sometimes refereed to as ﬁrst exit process [33]).
As shown in the ﬁgure, the difference between successive
two points in the Sony bank rate becomes longer than the
time intervals of the market rates. In Table II, we show
several data concerning the Sony bank USD/JPY rate vs.
tick-by-tick data by Bloomberg for USD/JPY rate. It is non-
trivial problem to ask what kind of distribution is suitable

to explain the distribution of the ﬁrst passage time. For this
problem, we attempted to check several statistics from both
analytical and empirical points of view under the assumption
that
the ﬁrst passage time might obey a non-exponential
Weibull distribution [25], [26], [27]. We found that the data is
well explained by a Weibull distribution. This fact means that
the difference between successive Sony bank rate changes is
ﬂuctuated and has some memories.

III. PREVIOUS RELATED RESULTS

Before we start to explain what we attempt to do in the
present paper, we shortly summarize the related results which
were already obtained by the present authors.

• Sazuka (2006): We checked that the Sony bank rate is
well-described by a Weibull distribution by some empir-
ical data analysis (Weibull paper analysis, evaluation of
Kullback-Leibuler, Hellinger divergence measures) [25],
[26].

• Inoue and Sazuka (2006): We showed analytically that
the crossover between non-Gaussian L´evy regime to
Gaussian regime is observed even in the ﬁrst passage
process (which is the same process of the Sony bank
rates) for a truncated L´evy ﬂight (the so-called KoBoL
process [34], [35], [36] in mathematics or mathematical
ﬁnance) [37].

• Inoue and Sazuka (2006): We introduced queueing the-
oretical approach into the analysis of the Sony bank rate
and evaluated average waiting time including expected
returns. We also carried out computer simulations by

using the GARCH model to investigate the effect of the
rate window of the Sony bank [27].

• Sazuka (2006): We observed a phase transition between
a Weibull distribution to a power-law distribution at some
critical time from the empirical data analysis of the Sony
bank rate [26].

• Sazuka and Inoue (2007): We introduced the Gini index
to evaluate to what extent a Weibull distribution is well-
ﬁtted to explain the behavior of the ﬁrst passage process
of the Sony bank rate. The analytical evaluation and the
empirical data analysis gave quite similar results [38],
[17].

Then, we focus on the following two points.

• The effect of discreteness of returns in computer simula-

tion by means of the GARCH model.

• Generalization of the renewal-reward theorem to calculate
the higher order moments of the average waiting time or
to evaluate the average waiting time for the case in which
the observation time distribution of the trader is explicitly
given.

This paper is intended as an investigation of these two points.

IV. COMPUTER SIMULATIONS BY THE GARCH MODEL
WITH DISCRETE RETURNS

In the previous studies [27], we carried out computer
simulations of the Sony bank USD/JPY exchange rates by
assuming that the raw market data might be well-described by
the GARCH model [30], [31], [32] in which the successive
time intervals ∆t obey a Weibull distribution speciﬁed by a
single parameter m0, namely,

P (∆t) =

m0 (∆t)m0−1
a

exp

−

(cid:21)

(1)

In [27], we set a = 1 for a scaling parameter for simplicity to
handle. We investigated the stochastic process generated by the
rate window and estimated the distribution of time intervals of
the stochastic process ﬁltered by the rate window. Then, we
assumed that the output of the ﬁlter having rate window with
width 2ǫ also follows a Weibull distribution with m(6= m0)
and estimated m by means of Weibull paper analysis. The
plot m-m0 was obtained and the effect of the rate window on
the market rate became clear. However, in those simulations,
we assumed that the smallest price change (return) might take
continuous values for simplicity to carry out the simulations.
As we see in Table 1, the smallest price change unit of the tick-
by-tick market data is 0.01 yen. Therefore, we should modify
our computer simulations of the GARCH model by taking into
account the discreteness of the price change. In this section,
we show the result of the computer simulations. To this end,
we deal with here the following modiﬁed GARCH(1,1) model
[27]:

Xt = Xt−∆t + N (0, σ2
t )
t−∆t + β1σ2
t = α0 + α1X 2

parameters (m, a), namely,

(cid:20)

a

(cid:21)

and N (0, σ2
t ) in this expression stands for a Gaussian with
zero-mean and time dependent variance σ2
t . For simplicity,
we set the parameter a as a = 1. We should notice that the
GARCH(1,1) model has the variance σ2 after observing on a
long time intervals t → ∞ and σ2 leads to

σ2 =

α0
1 − α1 − β1

.

pdf of Yt = Xt−Xt−∆t for the above discrete GARCH model
with a parameter set: (α0, α1, β1) = (0.4, 0.3, 0.3) which gives
the kurtosis κ = 4.17 and variance σ2 = 1 in the limit of
t → ∞, and ∆ = 0.1 and ǫ = σ = 1. We should keep in
mind that the ratio between the width of the rate window and
the minimal change of the rate, namely, ǫ/∆ = 10 is the same
as that of the Sony bank rate. From this ﬁgure, we recognize
that the return Y actually takes discrete values as expected.

To investigate the effect of the rate window with width 2ǫ,
we estimate the Weibull parameter m of the output sequence
from the rate window by means of the so-called Weibull
paper analysis [25], [26], [27] for the cumulative Weibull
distribution. From Fig. 4, we ﬁnd that for the case of m0 =

less than x. The parameter ∆ appearing in (6) means the length
of the minimal variation of the return. In Fig. 3, we plot the

In Fig. 5, we plot the relation between m0 and m for several

the discrete cases with ∆ = 0.1 and 0.2 are almost same as
the relation for the continuous case ∆ = 0 reported in our
previous papers [27]. Meaningful differences are observed if

The relation between m0 and m for the case of ∆ = 0, 0.1, 0.2

we increase the value of ∆ up to 0.5. This result provides
us a justiﬁcation of our previous GARCH modeling [27] of
the market rate to simulate the Sony bank USD/JPY exchange
rates on the assumption that the minimum price change could
take inﬁnitesimal values.

V. DERIVATION OF THE WAITING TIME DISTRIBUTION

In the previous studies [27], we evaluated the average
waiting time for the customers to wait by the next price
change since they attempt to observe the price by making
use of the renewal-reward theorem [28], [29]. However, the
theorem itself is obviously restricted to deriving only the ﬁrst
moment of the waiting time. From this reason, it is very
hard to evaluate, for instance, the standard deviation from the
average waiting time within the framework of the theorem
(for example, see the proof of the theorem provided in [29]).
Thus, we need another procedure to calculate it without the
conventional derivation of the renewal-reward theorem. In this
section, we directly derive the distribution of the waiting time.
Our approach here enables us to evaluate not only the ﬁrst
moment of the waiting time but also any order of the moment.
This section is a core part of this paper.

A. The probability distribution of the waiting time

let us suppose that

We ﬁrst derive the probability distribution function of the
waiting time s. Then,
the difference
between successive two points of the Sony bank rate change,
namely, the ﬁrst passage time τ follows PW (τ ). Then, the
customers observe the rate in time t (0 ≤ t ≤ τ ) that should be
measured from the point at which the rate changes previously.
In Fig. 6, we show the relation among these points τ, t and s
in time axis. The waiting time of the customers is naturally
deﬁned by s ≡ τ − t. We should notice that the distribution
Ω(s) is written in terms of the ﬁrst passage time distribution
PW (τ ) and the observation time distribution PO(t) of the

first passage time  τ

Obviously, probability Q(s|τ, t) that the waiting time takes s

are given as t and τ , respectively, is given as

Q(s|τ, t) = δ(s − τ + t)

Thus, this probability distribution Ω(s) enables us to evaluate
any order of the moments for the waiting time.

In following, we evaluate the average waiting time and the
deviation around the average for typical two cases, namely,
PO(t) = 1 and PO(t) = e−t/τ0 .

1) The customers’ observation follows PO(t) = 1: We
ﬁrst consider the case of PO(τ ) = 1. This case corresponds
to the result obtained by the renewal-reward theorem [27].
Obviously, we ﬁnd that δn = 0 holds for arbitrary integer n.
Thus, the waiting time distribution Ω(s) leads to

It is important for us to notice that for an exponential distri-
bution m = 1, we have w = σ = a by taking into account
the fact that Γ(n) = (n − 1)!. Moreover, the average waiting
time w is identical to the average time interval E(τ ) since
w = E(τ 2)/2E(τ ) = E(τ ) holds if and only if m = 1 (The
rate changes follow a Poisson arrival process). These results
are already obtained in our previous studies [27]. In Fig. 7,

the standard deviation σ for a Weibull distribution with a = 49.6345 as a

2) The customers’ observation follows PO(t) = e−t/τ0: We
test the other observation time distribution of the customers.
For instance, we might choose PO(t) = e−t/τ0 on the
assumption that the customers might observe the rate more
frequently within the time scale τ0 around the previous rate
change than the time scale longer than τ0. Such a case could
be possible if the system provides some redundant information
about the point of the rate change to customers as quickly as
possible.

For this choice of the observation time distribution PO(t) =

e−t/τ0, we have

Therefore, from equations (12),(14) and (15), it is possible for
us to derive the waiting time distribution Ω(s) and average

waiting time and the deviation from the value. For the choice
of a Weibull ﬁrst passage time distribution PW (τ ), we need
some algebra, but easily obtain

This means that even if the trader observe the rate according to
a priori knowledge, namely, the observation time distribution
PO(t) = e−t/τ0, the standard deviation from the average
waiting time is the same order as the average waiting time
itself.

In this paper, we considered just only two cases of the
observation time distribution PO(t), however, the choice of
the distribution is completely arbitrary. The detail and more
carefully analysis of this point will be reported in our forth
coming article [17].

3) Comparison with empirical data analysis: It is time for
us to compare the analytical result with that of the empiri-
cal data analysis. For uniform observation time distribution
PO(t) = 1, we obtained σ = 60.2284 minutes. On the other
hand, from empirical data analysis, we evaluate the quantity
N
(19) by sampling the moment as E(τ n) = (1/N )
i=1 τ n
i
directly from Sony bank rate data [16] and ﬁnd σ = 74.3464
minutes. There exists a ﬁnite gap between the theoretical pre-
diction and the result by the empirical data analysis, however,
the both are the same order. The gap might become small if
we take into account the power-law tail of the ﬁrst passage
time distribution. In fact, our preliminary investigation shows
that for the average waiting time, the power-law tail makes the
gap between the theoretical prediction and empirical observa-
tion small [17]. Therefore, the same tail-effect is reasonably
expected even in the analysis of the deviation.

VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this paper, we proposed a different procedure from
the conventional derivation of the renewal-reward theorem.
This derivation enables us to evaluate arbitrary order of the
moments of the waiting time of the on-line foreign exchange
trading rate for the individual customers. We directly derived
the waiting time distribution and evaluated the deviation
around the average waiting time, which is not supported by
the renewal-reward theorem, for the Sony bank USD/JPY
exchange rates. We tested our analysis for several cases of
the observation time distribution of the customers and found
that the average waiting time and deviation from the value
are the same order even if the customers possesses a priori
knowledge as a form of the observation time distribution as
PO(t) = e−t/τ0. This result might be understood as follows.
As we mentioned, the system we dealt with in this paper has
two types of ﬂuctuations, namely, ﬂuctuation in the intervals of
events (price changes) and ﬂuctuation in the observation time
for the individual customers to observe the rate through the
World Wide Web. As well-known, in the N -body systems (N
is extremely large), there exists theremal ﬂuctuation (quantum-
mechanical ﬂuctuation as well in low temperature) affecting on
each particle, however, the macroscopic variables (the averages
over the Gibbs distribution) like pressure or internal energy

are determined as of order 1 objects and the deviation from
the average becomes zero as N −1/2. This is a reason why
statistical mechanics could predict a lot of physical quantities
and we could compare the prediction with the same quantity
which was observed in experiments. On the other hand,
although the ﬁnancial market price changes are taken place
as a result of trading by many people, the observed rate itself
is regarded as a result of effective single particle problems (a
complicated single random walker) and there is no such scale
parameter like the number of particle N . This is an intuitive
account of the result, namely, the average and the deviation
are the same order even if there exist two kinds of ﬂuctuation
in the systems.

Remaining problems concerning the analysis of the Sony
bank rate are ﬁrstly to investigate the effect of the tail of the
ﬁrst passage time distribution. Our preliminary observation
from the empirical data implied that, at some critical point,
the distribution changes its shape from a Weibull-law to a
power-law [26]. Therefore, it is important for us to check
to what extent the prediction by the renewal-reward theorem
is modiﬁed by taking into account the tail effect of the ﬁrst
passage time distribution. Secondly, we should show explicitly
that the ﬁrst passage time distribution described by the Mittag-
Lefﬂer function [9], [10], [15]:

P (τ ) =

(0 < β < 1)

(32)

(−1)n (τ /τ0)βn
Γ(βn + 1)

is impossible to realize the ﬁrst passage process of the Sony
bank by comparing the analytical result of the average waiting
time or the Gini index with those obtained by the empirical
data analysis. The detail of these studies will be reported
shortly in [17].

As we showed in this paper, our queueing theoretical
approach might be useful for us to build artiﬁcial markets
such as the on-line trading service so as to have a suitable
waiting time for the individual customers by controlling the
width of the rate window. Moreover, theoretical framework we
provided here could predict the average waiting time including
the deviation.

We hope that our strategy in order to analyze the stochastic
process of markets from the view point of the waiting time of
the customers might help researchers or engineers when they
attempt to construct a suitable system for their customers.

Modular Implementation of Particle Flow Algorithm with Minimized
Dependence on the Detector Geometry

A.Raspereza

A Particle Flow Algorithm (PFA) with the minimized dependence on the detector geometry is presented. Current
PFA implementation includes procedures of the track reconstruction, calorimeter clustering, and individual particle
reconstruction and is meant as a tool for the optimization of the International e+e− Linear Collider detector.

1. INTRODUCTION

The most promising strategy for event reconstruction at the future linear e+e− collider experiment is based on the
particle ﬂow concept, implying reconstruction of the four-vectors of all particle produced in an event. The particle
ﬂow algorithm works best at moderate energies of individual particles, below about 100 GeV. In this regime, the
tracking system reconstructs the momentum of the charged particles with an accuracy superseding the energy and
angle measurements with calorimeters. Hence, in order to attain a better reconstruction of events, the charged particle
measurement must be solely based on the tracking information. The crucial step of the particle ﬂow algorithm is
correct assignment of calorimeter hits to the charged particles and eﬃcient separation of close-by showers produced
by charged and neutral particles. Monte Carlo studies have shown that an ideal reconstruction algorithm [1], which
ﬁnds each particle and measures its energy and direction with the detector resolution expected for single particles,
could reach a jet energy resolution of 14%/√E. Over the years a jet energy resolution of 30%/√E has become
accepted as a good compromise between the theoretically possible and practically achievable resolution.

In this paper modular implementation of the Particle Flow algorithm (PFA) with weak dependence on the detector

geometry is presented. It is meant as a tool for the linear collider detector optimization.

Particle Flow algorithm is implemented in a modular way within the framework of the MARLIN package [2].

2. PARTICLE FLOW ALGORITHM IN MARLIN

Algorithm consists of the following steps:

track ﬁnding and ﬁtting in the main tracking device;

cluster ﬁnding in calorimeters;

cluster matching and reconstruction of individual particles.

Each step is implemented as a separate module, MARLIN processor. All processors constitute MarlinReco package
which can be downloaded from the web [3].

2.1. Track Finding and Fitting

Two separate track ﬁnding algorithms are available within the MarlinReco package. The ﬁrst one is based on
the existing LEP code and optimized for the Time-Projection-Chamber (TPC) as the main tracking device. The
algorithm exploits Kalman ﬁlter approach for track ﬁnding and ﬁtting, taking into account particle interaction

with the detector material such as ionization losses and multiple scattering. The second algorithm is designed for
silicon tracker, which has relatively small number of layers. Algorithm represents combinatorial search for set of hits
compatible with the helix hypothesis.

2.2. Calorimeter Clustering

Cluster ﬁnding in calorimeters is based solely on the spatial information. Algorithm requires as an input the list
of calorimeter hits with their coordinates. No amplitude information is used in the clustering procedure, making
the algorithm applicable to both analogue and digital calorimeters. Clustering is applied on the uniﬁed array of
hits in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters and produces as an output the list of found clusters. Detailed
description of the algorithm can be found in Reference [4]. Found clusters are classiﬁed into four-categories on the
basis of the cluster shape analysis.

The electro-magnetic clusters, whose longitudinal proﬁle is compatible with an expectation from electrons or
photons.

The MIP (minimal ionizing particle) clusters, whose shape is compatible with the helix model. In addition an
energy of such clusters is required to be compatible with an expectation from MIP.

The hadronic clusters; these are clusters not classiﬁed as the MIP or electromagnetic clusters.

2.3. Track

Cluster Matching and Individual Particle Reconstruction

−

Once tracking and the calorimeter clustering is performed, an attempt is made to associate clusters with tracks.
For each track, its intersection point with the front face of the electromagnetic calorimeter is determined. Cluster
containing calorimeter hit closest to this intersection point is found. If the distance from the intersection point to
the closest hit is less than certain predeﬁned threshold, cluster is associated with the track.

Electromagnetic clusters with no associated track are identiﬁed as photons, whereas electromagnetic clusters with
associated track are regarded as electrons/positrons. MIP clusters with associated track are identiﬁed as muons.
Hadronic clusters with associated tracks are accepted as charged pion candidates. Finally, hadronic clusters with no
associated track are identiﬁed as neutral hadrons. Four-momentum of charged objects are estimated using tracking
information. Track parameters at the point of closest approach to the primary interaction point deﬁne momentum
vector of charged objects (electrons, muons, charged hadrons). For neutral objects, cluster energy is used as an
estimate of particle energy, while the line connecting interaction point with the cluster centroid is used as an estimate
of the direction of particle momentum vector.

Performance of the algorithm has been tested with the sample of hadronic events at Z-pole. The algorithm
is applied to the diﬀerent detector models. Figures 1 and 2 present the reconstructed visible mass for the LDC
(Large Detector Concept) detector with the TPC as the main tracking device. Detector simulation is performed
with the program Mokka [5]. Figure 1 corresponds to the LDC detector with the analogue W-Si electromagnetic
calorimeter (ECAL) and analogue hadron calorimeter consisting of steel absorber plates interleaved with scintillating
tiles. Figure 2 corresponds to the LDC detector with the analogue W-Si ECAL and digital HCAL consisting of
steel absorber plates interleaved with the resistive-plate chambers (RPC) as an active elements. Figure 3 presents
the reconstructed visible mass for the small detector with the silicon tracker (SiD), W-Si ECAL and digital RPC
HCAL. The detector response is simulated with the SLIC program [6]. The resolution achieved varies from 40 to
45%, depending on the detector model.

Abstract

The transition to fully developed turbulence of a wake behind a circular cylin-

der is investigated with respect to its statistics. In particular, we evaluated

the probability density functions of velocity increments on diﬀerent length

scales r. Evidence is presented that the r-dependence of the velocity incre-

ments can be taken as Markov processes in the far ﬁeld, as well as, in the

near ﬁeld of the cylinder wake. With the estimation of the deterministic part

of these Markov processes, as a function of the distance from the cylinder, we

are able to set the transition to fully developed turbulence in analogy with a

phase transition. We propose that the appearing order parameter corresponds

to the presence of large scale coherent structures close to the cylinder.

I. INTRODUCTION

In recent years considerable progress has been performed to understand the statistical

features of fully developed, local isotropic turbulence [1]. Special interest has been addressed

to understand intermittency eﬀects of small scale velocity ﬂuctuations characterized by the

velocity increments ur(x) := u(x + r) − u(x) at a scale r. For most real ﬂows these results

are only applicable for small well deﬁned regions of the ﬂow, which may be regarded as local

isotropic. A remaining challenge is to ﬁnd out how theses concepts can help to understand

real ﬂows which are not fully developed or not homogeneous and isotropic [2].

The common method to characterize the disorder of fully developed local isotropic turbu-

lence is to investigate the scale evolution of the probability density functions (pdf), Pr(ur),

either directly or by means of their moments < un

r >=

un
r P (ur) dur. Recently, it was found

R

that this r evolution can be related to a Markov process [3]. The Markovian properties can be

evaluated thoroughly by investigating the joint and conditional pdfs, P (ur2, r2; ur1, r1) and

P (ur2, r2|ur1, r1), respectively [4]. From the conditional pdfs one can extract the stochastic

equations, namely, the Kramers-Moyal expansion for the r evolution of Pr and the Langevin

equation for ur [5]. This method provides a statistically more complete description of tur-

bulence and furthermore assumptions, like scaling, are not needed, but can be evaluated

accurately [3,6].

In this work we present measurements of a turbulent ﬂow behind a circular cylinder.

The stochastic content of the velocity ﬁeld as a function of the distance to the cylinder is

investigated using the above mentioned Markovian approach. The main result, presented in

this paper, is the ﬁnding of a phase transition like behavior to the state of fully developed

turbulence. This phase transition characterizes the disappearance of the Karman vortices

with respect to two parameters: the distance to the cylinder and the scale r.

In the following we describe ﬁrst the experimental set up. The measurements of longitu-

dinal and transversal velocities are analyzed with respect to the r dependent pdfs. Subse-

quently a test of Markov properties is presented. From the conditional pdf the ﬁrst moment

2

M (1) is evaluated. The M (1) coeﬃcient reﬂects the deterministic part in the r-evolution of

the Markov process and can be taken to deﬁne an order parameter.

II. EXPERIMENT

Our work is based on hot-wire velocity measurements performed in a wake ﬂow generated

behind a circular cylinder inserted in a wind tunnel. Cylinders with two diameters d of 2 cm

and 5 cm were used. The wind tunnel [7] used has the following parameters: cross section

1.6m x 1.8m; length of the measuring section 2m; velocity 25m/s; residual turbulence level

below 0.1 %. To measure longitudinal and transversal components of the local velocity

we used x-wire probes (Dantec 55P71), placed at several distances, D, between 8 and 100

diameters of the cylinder. The spatial resolution of the probes is about 1.5 mm.

From the measurements the following characteristic lengths were evaluated: the integral

length, deﬁned by the autocorrelation function, which varied between 10 cm and 30 cm

depending on the cylinder used and location of the probe; the Kolmogorov length, was about

0.1mm; the Taylor length scale about 2.0 mm. Thus we see that our measurement resolved

at least the turbulent structures down to the Taylor length scales.

(Note, these lengths

could be calculated precisely only for distances above 40 cylinder diameters.) The Reynolds

numbers of these two ﬂow situations were Rλ = 250 and 650. Each time series consists of

107 data points, and was sampled with a frequency corresponding to about one Kolmogorov

length. To obtain the spatial variation the Taylor hypothesis of frozen turbulence was used.

To investigate the disorder of the turbulent ﬁeld the velocity increments for diﬀerent

scales r and at diﬀerent measuring points D were calculated. Exemplary sequences of

resulting pdfs are shown in Fig.1 for the transversal velocity component. In Fig. 1a the well

known intermittency eﬀect of isotropic turbulence is seen. At large scales nearly Gaussian

distributions are present which become more and more intermittent (having heavy tailed

wings) as the scale r approaches the Kolmogorov length. Coming closer to the cylinder a

structural change is found. Most remarkably a double hump pdf emerges for large r. This

structure reﬂects the fact that two ﬁnite values of the velocity increment are most probable.

We interpret this as the result of counterrotating vortices passing over the detector. It should

be noted that this eﬀect was always found for the transversal velocity components. This is

in consistency with the geometric features of vortices elongated parallel to the cylinder axis

(Karman vortices). For small scales the humps vanish and the pdfs become similar to the

isotropic ones.

IV. MARKOV PROCESS

Based on the ﬁndings that the evolution of the pdfs with r for the case of fully developed

turbulence can be described by a Fokker-Planck equation [3,8], we apply the Markov analysis

to the non fully developed states close to the cylinder. The basic quantity to be evaluated

is the conditional pdf P (ur2, r2|ur1, r1), where, r2 < r1, and ur2 is nested into ur1 by

a midpoint construction. To verify the Markovian property, we evaluate the Chapman-

Kolmogorov equation, c.f. [5]

P (ur2, r2|ur1, r1) =

P (ur2, r2|urx, rx)P (urx, rx|ur1, r1) durx,

(1)

∞

Z

−∞

where r2 < rx < r1. The validity of this equation was examined for many diﬀerent pairs of

(r1, r2). As a new result, we found that equation (1) also holds in the vicinity of the cylinder,

i.e.

in the non developed case of turbulence. For illustration see Figure 2; in part a the

integrated conditional pdf (rhs of (1)) and the directly evaluated pdf (lhs of (1)) are shown

by superimposed contour plots. In ﬁgurepart b three exemplary cut through these three

dimensional presentations are shown. The quality of the validity of (1) can be seen from the

proximity of the contour lines, or by the agreements of the conditional pdfs, represented by

open and bold symbols [9]. Based on this result we treat the evolution of the statistics with

the scale r as a Markov process in r. Thus the evolution of the pdf Pr(ur) is described by

the partial diﬀerential equation called Kramers-Moyal expansion [5]:

where δ = r − rx. Notice, having once evaluated the conditional pdfs, these so called

Kramers Moyal (KM) coeﬃcients can be estimated directly from the data without any

additional assumption. For our purpose it is suﬃcient to consider the M (k) for a small

length of δ ≈ 2η. The physical interpretation of the KM coeﬃcients is the following: D(1)

describes the deterministic evolution and is called drift term. D(k), for k ≥ 2 reﬂect the

inﬂuence of the noise. D(2) is called diﬀusion term. In the case of non Gaussian noise the

higher order KM coeﬃcients (k > 2) become non zero.

We found that the structural change of the pdfs described above (see ﬁg. 1) is mainly

given by M (1). As shown in ﬁgure 3, we ﬁnd that close to the cylinder the form of the M (1)

changes from a linear ur-dependence at small scales to a 3rd order polynomial behavior.

From the corresponding Langevin equation [5] we know that the zeros of the drift term

correspond to the ﬁxed points of the deterministic dynamics. Fixed points with negative

slope belong to accumulation points, having the tendency to build up local humps in the

pdf. The change of the local slope of a ﬁxed point (ﬁg 3) can be set into correspondence

to a phase transition, c.f. [10,5]. Note that in contrast to other models, where the process

evolves in time, here, we stress on the evolution in the scale variable r.

The main point of our analysis is that we can determine the evolution equation in form

of the KM coeﬃcients. This tool is much more sensitive than merely looking at the pdfs

or its moments, because the pdfs reﬂect only the transient behavior due to the underlying

evolution equation. Thus it becomes clear that we are able to elaborate the phase transition

even in the case where the double hump structure in the pdf may not be clearly visible. We

want to mention that these double hump behavior of the pdfs can well be reproduced by

5

calculating the stationary solution of the corresponding Fokker Planck equation, using our

measured KM coeﬃcient M (1) [11].

Beside the spatial scale parameter r, the second parameter of the wake experiment is

the distance of the probe to the cylinder. As it is well known, with increasing the distance

a transition to fully developed turbulence takes place, i. e., the double hump structure

vanishes. To characterize the phase transition in this two dimensional parameter space

more completely we performed the above mentioned data analysis at several distances. As

a criteria of a phase transition the local slope at M (1)(ur, r, z) = 0 was determined. The

magnitude of this local slope is shown in ﬁgure 4 as a contour plot. The dark colored region

reﬂects the parameter space, where 3 zeros for M (1) are present, or where the local slope at

ur = 0 is positive. This is the region where the new order parameter exists. The critical line

of the phase transition is marked by the bold black line.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

We have presented a new approach to characterize also the disorder of not fully devel-

oped turbulence. The central aspect is that the disorder, described by velocity increments

on diﬀerent length scales, r, are set into the context of Markov processes evolving in r.

Thus we can see how a given increment changes with decreasing r due to deterministic and

random forces. Both forces can be estimated directly from the data sets via Kramers-Moyal

coeﬃcients of the conditional probabilities. Most interestingly, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant changes

in the deterministic force, the drift term, as one passes from non fully developed turbulence

(close to the cylinder) into fully developed turbulence (far behind the cylinder). In the far

ﬁeld the drift term causes a stable ﬁxed point at ur = 0, i.e. the deterministic force causes

a decrease of the magnitude of velocity increments as r decreases. Approaching the near

ﬁeld at large r this ﬁxed point becomes instable, i.e. the slope of the drift term changes its

sign at ur = 0. In our one-dimensional analysis we ﬁnd the appearance of two new stable

(attracting) ﬁxed point which are related to the double hump structure of the corresponding

6

pdfs. This phenomenon may be set into relation with a phase transition, where the phase

of the near ﬁeld correspond to the existence of vortices. As the distance to the cylinder is

increased these large scale structures vanish.

Finally some critical remarks are presented, to show in which direction work should

be done in future. Visualizations indicate that even in the case of strong turbulence, the

near ﬁeld still resembles time periodic structures of counterrotationg vortex-like structures

detaching from the cylinder, c.f. [12]. Theses time periodic large scale structures ask for a

two-dimensional (two variable) modeling, in the sense of a noisy limit cycle. This apparent

contradiction to our one-variable analysis, has to be seen on the background of the signal

treatment. Applying to a time series the construction of increments (which represents a kind

of high pass ﬁlter) the locality in time is lost. Thus also coherences in time may get lost, at

least as long as one investigates small scale statistics. In this sense only a stochastic aspect of

the counterrotating vortices is grasped. The challenge of a more complete characterization of

the near ﬁeld structures will require, in our opinion, a combination of increment analysis and

real time modeling of the velocity data. At least for the ladder point a higher dimensional

ansatz is required. Nevertheless we have presented in this work clear evidence how methods

and results obtained from the idealistic case of fully developed turbulence can be used to

characterize also the statistics in the transition region of a wake ﬂow.

A study on the behavior of oﬀ-site AC power failure recovery times at three nuclear plant sites is
presented. It is shown, that power law is appropriate for the representation of failure frequency-

assumption of power law for the parent distribution. The extreme value distributions obtained are
used for extrapolation beyond the region of observation.

1. Introduction

Estimation of oﬀ-site power failure characteristics is important for the safe design and operation of nuclear power
plants. The emergency power supply requirements are based on the ability to forecast the maximum credible loss of
oﬀ-site power (LOSP) duration during the life time of the plant. The observed data is available only over a period
of less than two decades and scarce on long duration failures. We address two questions: ﬁrst, what is the nature of
the parent distribution, i.e., the form of frequency-duration correlation function and second how to extrapolate for
failure durations longer than the observed maximum.

First we show, based on simple assumptions about the oﬀ-site power supply system component failure and repair
rates, that the frequency-duration correlation function is a power law of the form, y ∝ x−k. Next, it is established that
the distribution of annual maxima, of observed failures follow Type II asymptotic distribution (Frechet distribution,
see Johnson 1970). This result strengthens the premise, that the parent distribution for power failure duration-
correlation is power law in character. Extreme value analysis is also used to make extrapolations for more number of
years than observed, for instance to estimate the most probable loss of oﬀ-site power duration in say, 50 or 100 years.

2. Oﬀ-site power failure frequency-duration function

The oﬀ-site AC power at a plant may be lost due to supply failure from the power grid or because of plant centered
equipment failure like station transformer, feeders, breakers etc. The grid failure could be a minor grid disturbance
or grid collapse. The grid power may also fail due to severe environmental conditions. Baranowsky, (1988) has used
Weibull functions of the form (λie(−αitβ )) for representing the frequency of oﬀ-site power failure events of each type,
exceeding a given duration. Although the ﬁts are good, it would be better if some physical basis could be established
for the ﬁtted function. Further considering the scarcity of data, instead of a series of stretched exponentials a single
function would be preferable. It is postulated here that there is a mixture of power failure rates λi with a certain
probability density g(λi) as λi ∈ {λi|i = 1..N }. Similarly for the repair rates µi ∈ {µi|i = 1..N }. That is, there are
diﬀerent kinds of equipment each with a speciﬁc λi and µi. Then the probability of observing a failure of duration
t′ ≥ t is

where e(−µit) is the probability that the failed component is not restored in time t, assuming constant repair rate
µi. Since more frequent failures are generally repairable in shorter times compared to rare failures which take more
time to set right, it is assumed that µ ∝ λ, with this assumption in equation 1, and going over to the continuous limit
we get,

Where c > 0 is a constant of proportionality. The form of g is not known, however it is known (Johnson, 1970) that
if gamma distribution

for constants α, k > 0, is assumed for g, then Pareto distribution is obtained as the cumulative distribution function
F (t) = 1 − P (t′ ≥ t). That is the solution of equation 2 is

For large t, P (t) goes like P (t) ∽ (θ/t)k; k > 0; θ > 0; t ≥ 0, where θ = α/c and

This family includes Cauchy, t and F distributions. The function P(t) is plotted for data observed at two plant sites,
over a period of 15-20 years, in Fig. 1 and 2. The plots show P(t) versus LOSP time t in Log-Log scale. The linear
ﬁts are shown alongside, which conﬁrm the power law character of the distribution. In Fig. 1 there is considerable
deviation from straight line for the ﬁrst few points. This is due to the fact that for small values of t, i.e., for c
α t << 1,
P(t) is virtually constant, and the power law dependence manifests fully for large t. The LOSP frequency-duration
correlation function has the same time dependence as it will be diﬀerent from P (t) only by a constant factor.

3. Extreme value analysis of LOSP duration

The distribution of maximum of m observations of the random variable t, distributed as F(t) is,

The non-trivial limit distribution G(t) is obtained by appropriate scaling of the variable t,

when F (t) is of the form of equation 4, the asymptotic limit, with bm = 0 is

which is one of the three possible asymptotic limits, that is, a type II extreme value distribution (Fisher et al., 1928
and Gumbel, 1954) also known as Frechet distribution. For ﬁnite m equation 5 is written as Gm(t) = e−(θm/t)k

.

Extreme value analysis of LOSP data collected in (Theivarajan 1999, Marimuthu et al., 2000 and Kumar et al.,
2002), is done as follows. The annual maximum ti for each location is arranged in ascending order as, t1 < t2 < ... < tN .
The plotting points F(i) are calculated as

(See Karl Bury, 1999), where N is the number of years over which the data is collected. The F (i) approximate the
median of the distribution free estimate of the cumulative distribution function. When −ln(−ln(F (i))) are plotted
against ln(t), where t is the power failure duration, straight lines are obtained as depicted in Figs. 3, 4 and 5, as
expected from equation 5. The exponents k obtained from the slope, is shown in the respective ﬁgures.

The distribution of maximum in any n years will be

The most probable maximum

t is plotted in Fig. 6, for the three locations. The relatively higher value of most
probable maximum for TAPS and FBTR cases is due to higher incidence of recorded on-site power distribution
equipment failure. From Fig. 6 we can infer that, for instance a 20 h LOSP extrema is likely in TAPS site in 15 y,
whereas events of such duration are expected to occur only in 50 years and 100 years respectively for the FBTR and
MAPS sites. These conclusions are based on the data collected from these sites and results are indicative only.

4. Conclusion

The nature of the relationship of oﬀ-site power failure duration and its frequency is studied and it is found to
have power law dependence. Plausible physical basis for the observed behavior is given. The power law nature of
asymptotic behavior is conﬁrmed by performing an extreme value analysis of the data. The extreme value distribution
is also used to extrapolate beyond observed LOSP durations.

It is interesting to note that, power laws have been observed in a variety of natural and man made settings like,
frequency distribution of words (Zipf, 1949), distribution of incomes, earthquake magnitudes and recently in internet
topology (Faloutsos et al., 1999), to name a few. Based on the intimate connection between power laws and the ideas
of self organized criticality (Bak et al., 1987), it can be said that oﬀ-site power distribution system seems to evolve into
a critical state, where failures of longer duration are not infrequent, as one would expect for exponential distribution.
Although it is convenient not to consider cutoﬀs to failure duration from a theoretical perspective, it would be better
if methods could be devised to include cutoﬀs considering the ﬁniteness of the system.

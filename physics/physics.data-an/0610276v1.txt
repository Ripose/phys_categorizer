Abstract

In this paper, we report the performance, stability and robustness of Artiﬁcial
Neural Networks (ANN) and Boosted Decision Trees (BDT) using MiniBooNE
Monte Carlo samples by smearing and shifting the input variables of testing sam-
ples. Based on these studies, BDT has better particle identiﬁcation performance
than ANN. The uncertainty of testing results due to various BDT trainings is
smaller than those from ANN trainings. Both BDT and ANN degrade perfor-
mance by smearing and shifting the input variables of testing samples, but ANN
degrades more than BDT. BDT is more powerful, stable and robust than ANN.

1 Introduction

The Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANN) technique has been widely used in data anal-
ysis of High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments in the last decade. The use of the
ANN technique usually gives better results than the traditional simple-cut techniques.
Based on our previous studies, Boosted Decision Trees (BDT) with Adaboost[1, 2, 3]
or ǫ−Boost[4, 5] algorithm work better than ANN and some other boosting algorithms
for MiniBooNE particle identiﬁcation (PID)[6, 7]. MiniBooNE is a crucial experi-
ment operated at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory which is designed to conﬁrm
or refute the evidence for νµ → νe oscillations at ∆m2 ≃ 1eV 2 seen by the LSND
It will imply new physics beyond the Standard Model of particle
experiment[8, 9].
physics if the LSND signal is conﬁrmed by the MiniBooNE experiment. The boost-
ing algorithm is one of the most powerful learning techniques introduced during the
past decade; it is a procedure that combines many “weak” classiﬁers to achieve a ﬁnal
powerful classiﬁer. The major advantages of boosted decision trees are their stability
based on “majority vote”, their ability to handle large number of input variables (the
maximum number of input variables tested is 322 using MiniBooNE MC samples), and
their use of boosted weights for misclassiﬁed events to give these events a better chance
to be correctly classiﬁed in succeeding trees. More and more major HEP experiments
(ATLAS,BaBar,CDF,D0 etc.) [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] have begun to use boosting

algorithms as an important tool for data analysis since our ﬁrst successful application
of BDT for MiniBooNE PID[6, 7].

For practical application of data mining algorithms, performance, stability and ro-
bustness are determinants. In this paper, we focus on stability and robustness of ANN
and BDT with ǫ−Boost (ǫ = 0.01) by smearing or shifting values of input variables
randomly for testing samples. The results obtained in this paper do not represent
optimal MiniBooNE PID performance because we only use 30 arbitrarily selected vari-
ables for ANN and BDT training and testing. BDT with more input variables results
in signiﬁcantly better performance. However, ANN will not improve signiﬁcantly by
using more input variables [6, 7].

2 Training and Testing Samples

The training sample has 50000 signal and 80000 background events. An independent
testing sample has 54291 signal and 166630 background events. Fully oscillated νe
charged current quasi-elastic (CCQE) events are signal; all νµ and non-CCQE intrinsic
νe events are treated as background. The signature of each event is given by 322
variables[17, 18]. Thirty out of 322 variables were selected randomly for this study.
(The selection was by variable name not by the power of the variables.) All selected
variables are used for ANN and BDT training and testing.

We prepared 10 diﬀerent training samples. Each sample has 30000 signal and 30000
background events selected randomly from the large training sample. Both ANN and
BDT are trained separately on each of these training samples. For a given testing
sample, then, ANN and BDT each have 10 sets of results. The mean values and
variance of the 10 sets of results are calculated for ANN and BDT comparison.

In order to study the stability of ANN and BDT on the testing samples, we randomly
smear or shift the input variables by 3%, 5% and 10%, respectively. The smearing
formula is written as

i = V j
V j

i

× (1 + Smear × Rj
i )

i represents value of j-th variable in i-th testing event, Smear is the smearing
i is a random number with a Gaussian distribution;

where V j
factor (= 0, 0.03, 0.05 or 0.1). Rj
it is diﬀerent for each variable and each event.
The shifting formula can be written as

i = V j
V j

i

× (1 + Shif t × Rj
i )

where V j
factor (= 0, 0.03, 0.05 or 0.1) and Rj

i represents value of j-th variable in i-th testing event, Shif t is the shifting
i is a discrete random number with value 1 or -1.

3 Results

All ANN and BDT results shown in this paper are from testing samples.

3.1 Results from original testing samples

Tables 1 list signal and background eﬃciencies for ANN and BDT with root mean
square (RMS) errors and statistical errors for background eﬃciencies. The eﬃciency
ratio is deﬁned as background eﬃciency from ANN divided by that from BDT using
the original testing sample (no smearing and shifting) and the same signal eﬃciency.
Eﬃciency ratio values greater than 1 mean that BDT works better than ANN by
suppressing more background events (less background eﬃciency) for a given signal
eﬃciency. From Table 1, the eﬃciency ratios vary from about 1.06 to 1.82 for signal
eﬃciencies ranging from 90% to 30%. Lower signal eﬃciencies yield higher ratio values.
The statistical error of the test background eﬃciency for ANN is slightly higher than
that for BDT depending on the signal eﬃciency. The variance of 10 test background
eﬃciencies for ANN trained with 10 randomly selected training samples is about 2 ∼ 4
times larger than that for BDT. This result indicates that BDT training performance
is more stable than ANN training.

3.2 Results from smeared testing samples

The background eﬃciency versus signal eﬃciency for diﬀerent smeared testing samples
is shown in Figure 1. The top plot is for results from ANN, the bottom plot is for
results from BDT. Dots are for the results from the testing sample without smearing,
boxes, triangles and stars are for results from testing samples with 3%, 5% and 10%
smearing, respectively. Both ANN and BDT are quite stable for testing samples which
are randomly smeared within 5%, typically within about 7%-12% performance decrease
for BDT and 7% - 17% decrease for ANN as shown in Figure 1. For the 10% smeared
testing sample, however, the performance of ANN is degraded by 31% to 76%; higher
signal eﬃciency results have larger degradation. The corresponding performance of
BDT is degraded by 29% to 57%.

The variance of background eﬃciencies based on trials versus signal eﬃciency for the
10 diﬀerent smeared testing samples is shown in Figure 2. The variance of background
eﬃciencies from BDT is about 2 ∼ 4 times smaller than that from ANN as presented
in the bottom plot of Figure 3. The variance ratios between ANN and BDT remain
reasonably stable for various testing samples with diﬀerent smearing factors.

Figure 3 shows the ratio of background eﬃciency from ANN and BDT versus signal
eﬃciency (top plot) and the ratio of RMS of background eﬃciency from ANN and
BDT versus signal eﬃciency (bottom plot). Dots are for results from the testing
sample without smearing; boxes, triangles and stars are for results from 3%, 5% and
10% smearing, respectively. Error bars in the top plot are for RMS errors of ratios
which are calculated by propagating errors from the RMS errors from ANN and BDT
results. The performance of BDT ranges from 6% to 82% better than that of ANN,
depending on the signal eﬃciency as shown in the top plot of Figure 3. The ratio of
background eﬃciency from ANN and BDT increases with an increase in the smearing
factor. For the testing sample with 10% random smearing, the eﬃciency ratio ranges
from 2% - 12% with higher signal eﬃciency yielding a larger eﬃciency ratio increase.

3.3 Results from shifted testing samples

The background eﬃciency versus signal eﬃciency for diﬀerent shifted testing samples
is shown in Figure 4. The top plot is for results from ANN, the bottom plot is for
results from BDT. Dots are for results from testing sample without shifting; boxes,
triangles and stars are for results from from testing sample with 3%, 5% and 10%
shifting, respectively.

The corresponding RMS of background eﬃciencies based on 10 diﬀerent trials versus

signal eﬃciency for diﬀerent shifted testing samples is shown in Figure 5.

Figure 6 shows the ratio of background eﬃciency from ANN and BDT versus signal
eﬃciency (top plot) and the ratio of variance of background eﬃciency from ANN and
BDT versus signal eﬃciency (bottom plot). Dots are for results from the testing sample
without shifting, boxes, triangles and stars are for results from 3%, 5% and 10% shifting,
respectively. Error bars in the top plot are for RMS errors of ratios calculated using
error propagation from the RMS errors of the ANN and BDT results.

The results from Figures 4, 5, and 6 are similar to those obtained in the previous

tests.

3.4 Further Validation

In order to make a cross check, a new set of 30 out of the 322 particle identiﬁcation
variables were selected and the whole analysis was redone. Most results are quite
similar to the results obtained in Sections 3.1–3.3 as is seen in Figures 7 and 8. BDT,
again, was considerably more stable than ANN. However, the second set of 30 variables
overall was less powerful by a factor of about 2 than the ﬁrst set. Because of this, the
variances were dominated more by the random variations than the variations due to
change in power with smearing or shifting. The variances of the second set were only
about half the variances of the ﬁrst set, but exhibited much more random behavior.
(See bottom plot of Figure 8 and Figure 9).

4 Conclusions

The performance, stability and robustness of ANN and BDT were compared for particle
identiﬁcation using the MiniBooNE Monte Carlo samples. BDT has better particle
identiﬁcation performance than ANN, even using only 30 PID variables. The BDT
performance relative to that of ANN depends on the signal eﬃciency. The variance
in background eﬃciencies of testing results due to various BDT trainings is smaller
than those from ANN trainings regardless of testing samples with or without smearing
and shifting. The performance of both BDT and ANN are degraded by smearing and
shifting the input variables of the testing samples. ANN degrades more than BDT
depending on the signal eﬃciency. Based on these studies, BDT is more powerful,
stable and robust than ANN.

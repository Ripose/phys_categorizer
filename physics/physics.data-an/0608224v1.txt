Abstract

This paper illustrates a procedure for ﬁtting ﬁnancial data with α-stable distributions. After

using all the available methods to evaluate the distribution parameters, one can qualitatively select

the best estimate and run some goodness-of-ﬁt tests on this estimate, in order to quantitatively

assess its quality. It turns out that, for the two investigated data sets (MIB30 and DJIA from 2000

to present), an α-stable ﬁt of log-returns is reasonably good.

INTRODUCTION

There are several stochastic models available to ﬁt ﬁnancial price or index time series

Si

i=1 [1]. Building on the ideas presented by Bachelier in his thesis [2, 3], in a seminal paper

{
published in 1963, Mandelbrot proposed the L´evy α-stable distribution as a suitable model

}

for price diﬀerences, ξ = Si+1

Si, or logarithmic returns, ξlog = log(Si+1)

log(Si) [4]. In the

−

−

ﬁnancial literature, the debate on the L´evy α-stable model focused on the inﬁnite variance

of the distribution, leading to the introduction of subordinated models [5–7]; in the physical

literature, Mantegna used the model for the empirical analysis of historical stock-exchange

indices [8]. Later, Mantegna and Stanley proposed a “truncated” L´evy distribution [9–11],

an instance of the so-called KoBoL (Koponen, Boyarchenko and Levendorskii) distributions

L´evy α-stable distributions are characterized by a power-law decay with index 0 < α

2.

≤

Fitting the tails of an empirical distribution with a power law is not simple at all. Weron has

shown that some popular methods, such as the log-log linear regression and Hill’s estimator,

give biased results and overestimate the tail exponent for deviates taken from an α-stable

[12].

distribution [13].

In this paper, a method is proposed for ﬁtting ﬁnancial log-return time series with

L´evy α-stable distributions.

It uses the program stable.exe developed by Nolan [14]

and the Chambers-Mallow-Stuck algorithm for the generation of L´evy α-stable deviates

[15–17]. The datasets are:

the daily adjusted close for the DJIA index taken from

http://finance.yahoo.com and the daily adjusted close for the MIB30 index taken from

http://it.finance.yahoo.com both for the period 1 January 2000 - 3 August 2006. The

two datasets and the program stable.exe are freely available, so that whoever can repro-

duce the results reported below and use the method on other datasets.

The deﬁnition of L´evy α-stable distributions is presented in Section II. Section III is

devoted to the results of the empirical analysis. A critical discussion of these results can be

found in Section IV.

II. THEORY

A random variable Ξ is stable or stable in the broad sense if, given two independent copies

of Ξ, Ξ1 and Ξ2, and any positive constant a and b, there exist some positive c and some

real d such that the sum aΞ1 + bΞ2 has the same distribution as cΞ + d. If this property

holds with d = 0 for any a and b then Ξ is called strictly stable or stable in the narrow

sense. This deﬁnition is equivalent to the following one which relates the stable property to

convolutions of distributions and to the generalization of the central limit theorem [18]: A

random variable Ξ is stable if and only if, for all n > 1 independent and identical copies of

Ξ, Ξ1, . . . , Ξn, there exist a positive constant cn and a real constant dn such that the sum

Ξ1 + . . . + Ξn has the same distribution as cnΞ + dn. It turns out that a random variable Ξ

is stable if and only if it has the same distribution as aZ + b, where 0 < α

Thus, four parameters (a, b, α, β) are needed to specify a general stable distribution.

Unfortunately, the parameterization is not unique and this has caused several errors [19]. In

this paper, a parameterization is used, due to Samorodnitsky and Taqqu [20]:

III. RESULTS

Daily values for the MIB30 and DJIA adjusted close have been downloaded from

http://it.finance.yahoo.com and http://finance.yahoo.com, respectively, for the pe-

riod 1 January 2000 - 3 August 2006 [22]. The MIB30 is an index comprising 30 “blue chip”

shares on the Italian Stock Exchange, whereas the DJIA is a weighted average of the prices

of 30 industrial companies that are representative of the market as a whole. Notice that

the MIB30 includes non-industrial shares. Therefore, the two indices cannot be used for

comparisons on the behaviour of the industrial sector in Italy and in the USA. Moreover,

the composition of indices varies with time, making it problematic to compare diﬀerent

historical periods. However, the following analysis concerns the statistical properties of the

two indices, considered representative of the stock-exchange average trends. The datasets

are presented in Figs 1-4. Figs. 1 and 2 report the index value as a function of trading

day. There are 1709 points in the MIB30 dataset and 1656 points in the DJIA dataset.

Correpondingly, there are 1708 MIB30 log-returns and 1655 DJIA log-returns. They are

represented in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. The intermittent behaviour typical of log-return

time series can be already detected by eye inspection of Figs. 3 and 4, but this property will

not be further studied.

In Table I, the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis are reported for both the MIB30

The two log-return time series were given as input to stable.exe. The program imple-

ments three methods for the estimate of the four parameters of Eqs. (3) and (4). The ﬁrst

one is based on a maximum likelihood (ML) estimator [14, 23]. The second method uses

In Table II, the estimated values of α, β, γ, and δ are reported. The estimates were

obtained with the standard settings of stable.exe.

In order to preliminary assess the

quality of the ﬁts, three synthetic series of log-returns for each index were generated with the

Chambers-Mallow-Stuck algorithm. The empirical complementary cumulative distribution

function (CCDF) for absolute log-returns was compared with the simulated CCDFs, see

Figs. 5 and 6. In both cases, the ﬁt based on the SC function turned out to be the best

one. A reﬁnement of the ML method gave the same values for the four parameters as the

MIB30, but not for the DJIA data.

This paper illustrates a procedure for ﬁtting ﬁnancial data with α-stable distributions.

The ﬁrst step is to use all the available methods to evaluate the four parameters α, β, γ,

and δ. Then, one can qualitatively select the best estimate and run some goodness-of-ﬁt

tests, in order to quantitatively assess the quality of the ﬁt.

The main conclusion of this paper is that, for the investigated data sets, an α-stable ﬁt

is not so bad; the best parameter estimate is obtained with a method based on a sample

characteristic function ﬁt. Incidentally, the tail index, α, is 1.72 for MIB30 and 1.81 for

DJIA. These values are consistent with previous results [27] and with remarks made by

Weron [13]. The performance in two standard goodness-of-ﬁt tests (KS and χ2) is better for

DJIA data.

The two hypothesis tests used in this paper have some limitations. For instance, the

KS test is more sensitive to the central part of the distribution and underestimates the tail

contribution. For this reason, it would be better to use the Anderson-Darling (AD) test

[28]. However, a standardized AD test is not available for α-stable distributions. Moreover,

the value of ¯χ2 in the χ2 test is sensitive to the choice of intervals, and a detailed analysis

on this dependence would be necessary.

Given a set of ﬁnancial log-returns, is it possible to ﬁnd the best-ﬁtting distribution?

In general this question is ill-posed. As mentioned in the introduction, there are several

possible competing distributions that can give very similar results in the interval of interest.

Moreover, depending on the speciﬁc criterion chosen, diﬀerent distributions may turn out

to be the best according to that criterion. Therefore, if there is no theory suggesting the

choice of a speciﬁc distribution, it is advisable to use a pragmatic and heuristic approach,

application-oriented. For example, Figs. 9 and 10 show that the L´evy α-stable ﬁt discussed

in this paper tends to underestimate the tails of the probability density function (PDF) in

the two investigated cases. In risk asessment procedures, such as value at risk estimates,

density whose the PDF prudentially overestimates the tail region.

We present the G-MAPLE (Generalised Modal Analysis from the Poles of the Laplace Expansion)
software that allows decomposing data depending on a single parameter (such as time series data)
into a set of exponential functions having complex amplitudes and arguments. The novelty is that G-
MAPLE determines the unknown number of exponentials in the data along with the corresponding
complex amplitudes and arguments.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Decomposing a series of data points depending on a single parameter (that might be time, temperature, pressure...)

is an important problem in Science and Technology.

The data might be conductivity, chemical concentration, stock market volume, a communication signal etc... It is
required that the data is suspected to contain an unknown number of exponential components possessing complex
amplitudes and having complex arguments linear functions of the single parameter at hand [1, 2, 3].

The important point is that we do not have to specify the number of exponential components: the Pad´e-Laplace
algorithm ﬁnds it. This means, the algorithm performs Fourier analysis in the case of periodic or multiperiodic
input data, decomposes a purely decaying function into a set of exponentials having real arguments in contrast
to Fourier analysis where the arguments are pure imaginary, and ﬁnally analyses a function that decays while
simultaneously oscillating as consisting of a set of exponentials having complex arguments. In all three cases the
amplitudes are determined in complex form. It is a well-known fact that Fourier/spectral analysis breaks down when
dealing with exponentially decaying functions and numerical analysis or standard ﬁtting techniques fail when dealing
with functions of that sort, because of the ill-posed nature of the problem of exponential ﬁtting [4]. G-MAPLE
circumvents ill-posedness and succesfully gives, not only the number of exponential components in the function, but
also the corresponding amplitudes and arguments.

The applications of Generalised Modal analysis are numerous. Some of the ﬁelds of applications are:

Exponential and trigonometric ﬁtting of functions as used in the general Pade rational approximation approach
encountered in Quantum Mechanics [5], Particle physics, statistical physics [6]....

1. Numerical ﬁtting software:

2. Time series software:

Determination of time constants in arbitrary proﬁles of use in general diagnosis, seasonal trends, forecasting
etc...[7].

3. Communications engineering:

Separation of a signal from its echoes in telephone lines, multipath links (line of sight microwave propagation
or mobile outdoor/ indoor); traﬃc analysis requiring the determination of diﬀerent parameters yielding traﬃc
volume such as mean arrival times at a given channel [8].

4. Chemical engineering, oil, gas, pharmaceutical...:

Determination of the order of a given chemical reaction, detection of intermediate reactions, help in the ﬁnding
of intermediate reactants or processes etc... here, one expects exponential functions of temperature as well, due
to the various thermal activation or propagation processes [9].

Detection of the optimal or hidden number of parameters governing the behaviour of a complex system or
plant...

5. Control systems:

6. Mechanical engineering:

response of mechanical system such as a robot, mechanical arm, calculation of friction constants controlling the
motion etc...

Determination of number and type of species (biological or economic entities) and understanding the underlying
dynamics giving rise to the overall observed population or stock market volume at any given time... For instance,
it is used in ﬂuorescence decay studies in Biochemistry [10, 11].

8. Speech and acoustic engineering:

Determination of basic components of a phoneme in the time domain, in contrast to the windowed spectral
analysis method that is usually performed. echo and reverberation investigation in concert halls...

9. Geophysical prospecting and seismic data processing:

time dependent capacitance in DLTS (Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy) studies...

More recently, it was applied to gene sequencing where exponential functions are used in the calculation of partition

functions of DNA loop sequences [13, 14].

II. SOFTWARE PRESENTATION

G-MAPLE is a software that decomposes the given data in a set of exponential functions having complex
amplitudes and arguments. The novelty is that G-MAPLE determines the unknown number of exponentials in the
data along with their complex amplitudes and arguments [15].
G-MAPLE does a Taylor expansion of the Laplace transform of the data around a selected point in the complex
plane, ﬁts the expansion to a rational approximation, ﬁnds its poles and infers from them the arguments of the
exponential components and the values of their corresponding amplitudes. The number of exponential components is
found by increasing steadily the degree of the rational approximation. Presumably a set of poles will appear beyond
a certain degree and keep appearing later on, regardless of the degree. The number of stable poles is the number of
exponential components sought. These stable poles and their associated amplitudes give the exponential functions
the sum of which is the best ﬁt to the initial data.

Hence the plan of the G-MAPLE strategy [16] is:

• Preprocessing of the data: Filtering/Estimating the noise contained in the data or/and altering the sampling

rate of the data.

• Determination of the optimal point p0 for the Taylor expansion of the Laplace transform of the data.

• Pad´e rational approximation to the Taylor expansion.

• Inspection of pole stability.

• Consistency analysis.

A. Preprocessing of the data:

This is performed with a spline program. Once the data is entered an an estimate of the noise and a smoothing
parameter are provided. Altering and trying several sampling rates is done because it is important for the accuracy
required in the calculation of the Taylor coeﬃcients.

B. Determination of the optimal expansion point p0:

1. Initial study of the approximate locations of the poles from the Laplace transform of the data.

2. Performing the Taylor expansion for a given degree around several expansion points and examining the behaviour

of the coeﬃcients with the degree.

3

The estimation of the Taylor coeﬃcients of the Laplace transform [16] of the data is done for several trial p value.
An acceptable value for the expansion point p0 should yield a set of coeﬃcients whose magnitude decrease smoothly
with their algebraic normalised value staying at about the same level. This is done by a simple inspection of the plots
of the above sets of coeﬃcients versus the various expansion points. Once the point p0 is found one can start the
rational approximation analysis. By the same token the damping coeﬃcient is calculated as well. This is required
for rapidly varying data. It is possible sometimes to alter slightly the damping coeﬃcient in order to get a better
expansion point.

C. Rational approximation procedure:

Once the Taylor coeﬃcients of the Laplace transform have been determined about the optimal expansion point p0,
one has to vary the degree of the rational approximation to the Taylor expansion. One selects a high degree (5...12)
and calculates the rational approximation for all degrees: beginning from degree 2 to the highest possible degree.
One repeats for every degree between 2 and the largest one the calculation of the Taylor expansion and the rational
approximation. All poles and corresponding amplitudes for every degree are calculated and stored them in a master
pole ﬁle. The latter is required for the stability analysis. Regarding this procedure, two comments are in order:

1. It is is very important to choose carefully the expansion point p0 of the Taylor expansion. Once it is chosen
the Taylor coeﬃcients will be determined and from them the poles of the Laplace transform are obtained along
with the corresponding amplitudes.

2. When the poles and amplitudes are found one has to assess the implications of the signs of the amplitudes and
poles. For example: If the data shows a monotonic falloﬀ, then the poles should all be real negative. If the
data show oscillatory behaviour, then one must expect imaginary or complex poles. The poles and amplitudes
stored in pole. ﬁle for all degrees calculated, from 2 to the highest one (5..12) will be analysed by a stability
check procedure that will establish the history of occurrence of each pole as the degree has been varied.

D. Pole stability analysis:

After poles and amplitudes are calculated from the Laplace and rational approximation, one has to study the number
of occurrence of each pole with its corresponding amplitude. Since we are looking at the frequency of occurrence of
poles in the two-dimensional complex plane, we have to look at small areas where a given pole keeps showing up
persistently beyond a certain degree. For a given rough estimate of the size of the area in which the occurrence of
poles is conﬁned (an interactive test is provided for the size of the radius of the circular area). The sensitivity analysis
of the presumed stable poles and their occurrence in that small area is performed in order to evaluate the robustness
of the poles found.

E. Consistency analysis:

As a ﬁnal analysis of the soundness of the results, the software provides three capabilities:

1. The sequence of ratios of the Taylor coeﬃcients should converge towards the smallest modulus of the poles

found. This is a test of the accuracy of the calculation of the Taylor coeﬃcients.

2. Once the stable amplitudes and poles are found and have passed all tests descibed above, one can deﬁne an

analytical function from them that can generate data to be compared with the initial input data.

3. If the analysis fails or one wishes to perform a robustness analysis, it is required that the Taylor coeﬃcients
are well calculated since all the subsequent analysis is based on them. The software allows the selection of
several integration techniques along with several possible interpolation routes for the data to analyse. One may
compare the values of the coeﬃcients under the diﬀerent assumptions and choose the satisfactory ones.

III. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESSING STEPS:

1. Preprocessing:

Performing the smoothing of the data, estimating the noise contained in it and altering the sampling rate at
will for accuracy considerations during the calculation of the Taylor coeﬃcients.

4

2. Finding the optimal expansion point p0:

Two procedures are used:

(a) The Laplace transform of the data is performed in order to ﬁnd the approximate locations of the poles.

The optimal expansion point p0 should be larger than the largest pole found.

(b) Determination of the optimal point: This performs the Taylor expansion of the Laplace transform of the
data and estimates the damping coeﬃcient required for rapidly varying data values. The Taylor coeﬃcients
are plotted as a function of their order for the given degree and set of points chosen.

3. Rational approximation to the Taylor expansion of the Laplace transform of the data:

This step is to perform the rational approximation and ﬁnd the poles and amplitudes for all degrees starting
from 2 up to the highest degree chosen.

This step performs the stability analysis. The stable poles and amplitudes are found and stored.

4. Stability Analysis:

5. Consistency and ﬁnal checks:

(a) Generating an analytical function from the stable poles and amplitudes found. The accuracy of the Taylor
coeﬃcients is being granted by the graph showing whether their ratios approch the minimal pole modulus
or not as their order increases.

(b) Generating data points from the constructed analytical function and adding synthetic noise. One might

even add Gaussian or Uniform noise in order to make it as similar as possible to the initial data.

(c) Accuracy testing: This consists in obtaining the Taylor coeﬃcients with various methods depending on
the data available and the accuracy needed. It is advised to see how the various ways of calculating the
coeﬃcients alters the ﬁnal results (poles and amplitudes).

IV. PROCEDURE SUMMARY:

The summary reviews every step and indicates how the required input data is processed and how the results

obtained at every step described previously are checked:

1. Preprocessing: The user has to provide the data ﬁle name, the number of data points and how the ﬁle is
organized (data only, index and data or x, y data). In the ﬁltering step, an estimate of the noise contained in
the data as well as a smoothing parameter should be provided. The spline procedure returns an estimate of
the noise and if the smoothing parameter is well chosen the initial estimate of the noise and the returned noise
ﬁgure should be roughly in agreement. Finally it is possible to choose a diﬀerent sampling rate of the data once
it has been smoothed and splined. This has implications on the accuracy of the Taylor coeﬃcients and a test
exists in the software to check this accuracy.

2. Optimal expansion point: Assuming a range of points about which the Taylor coeﬃcients are calculated for a

chosen degree, the software returns the graphs and values of these coeﬃcients versus the degree.

3. Rational approximation: Providing an upper value of the degree for which the analysis is performed, the software
returns all poles and amplitudes for all degrees between degree 2 and the largest degree chosen. It returns also
a consistency graph showing the sequence of ratios of Taylor coeﬃcients for increasing order versus the minimal
modulus of the poles found.

4. Stability Analysis: For a given radius (within bounds) of the circular neighborhood about which the frequency
of occurrence of a given pole is examined, this analysis is done. The software returns the history of occurrences
of the poles and determines the stable ones.

5. Consistency Analysis: This is done automatically through the display of the graph of the ratios of the Taylor
coeﬃcients versus order with respect to the smallest modulus of the poles found with the Pad´e-Laplace rational
approximation. A new set of data from the stable poles and amplitudes found can be generated and compared
it to the initial input data. It is advised to examine the sensitivity of the Taylor coeﬃcients with respect to the
various ways of calculating them, depending on the type of data available.

D. Experimental example borrowed from fast spectroscopy

The example below Fig.1 shows an experimental noisy signal borrowed from fast laser spectroscopy. After prepro-
cessing the data and estimating the value of the noise present in the data, we perform the Pad´e-Laplace analysis and
the results are displayed in Fig.2. The diﬃculty in ﬁtting this example is due not only to the presence of noise but
also of the large initial value in the data. Despite these diﬃculties, G-MAPLE was able to extract the exponential
arguments and corresponding amplitudes successfully for a rough value of p0. Slightly changing p0 gave a minor im-
provement of the ﬁtting. The obstacle in ﬁnding a better ﬁt stems from the fact it is harder to ﬁnd a good expansion
point p0 for real noisy data. The challenge is to ﬁnd a better automatic procedure for the determination of p0 in the
case of noisy data. In that case, least-squares [2] or fast least-squares estimation methods provide better answers [17].

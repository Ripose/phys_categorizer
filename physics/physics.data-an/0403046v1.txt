Abstract

The points at which the log likelihood falls by 1

2 from its maximum value are often
used to give the ‘errors’ on a result, i.e. the 68% central conﬁdence interval. The validity of
this is examined for two simple cases: a lifetime measurement and a Poisson measurement.
Results are compared with the exact Neyman construction and with the simple Bartlett
approximation. It is shown that the accuracy of the log likelihood method is poor, and
the Bartlett construction explains why it is ﬂawed.

Introduction
In the limit where the number of measurements N is large, the variance of the maxi-

mum likelihood estimator ˆa of a parameter a is given by

This is given a somewhat non-rigorous justiﬁcation [1,2,3]: even though the log like-
lihood curve for a may not be a parabola, the parameter a could be converted to some a′
for which the log likelihood curve is parabolic; symmetric errors σa′ could be read oﬀ in
the standard way, and the a′ interval converted back to the corresponding interval for a.
The invariance of the maximum likelihood formalism then ensures that this interval is just
the ∆lnL =

1
2 interval for a.

This practice is now being questioned [4,5,6] and an examination of how well it actually
works in practice is needed to inform this discussion. In this note we consider two typical
cases where Maximum Likelihood estimation is used: the determination of the lifetime of
an unstable state decaying according to the radioactive decay law, and the determination
of the number of events produced by a Poisson process. In these we can determine the
1
interval produced by the ∆lnL =
2 recipe and contrast them with the exact Neyman
interval. This is found [2,7] from the values satisfying:

This note uses the 68% central conﬁdence region for illustration, but the techniques

can be applied to central or one-sided regions with any probability content.

Bayesian statistics can also be used to give conﬁdence intervals. This is an entirely
diﬀerent techique, and is not considered here. This study compares the exact Neyman
conﬁdence intervals with two methods which claim to approximate to them.

For the Bartlett approximation, the diﬀerential of Equation 4 gives N

expectation value of the second diﬀerential gives the variance of this as N
τ 2 . Thus for a
given τ the probability distribution for t has mean τ and standard deviation τ /√N . This
is exact. We then – this is the approximation – take this as being Gaussian and use it
in the Neyman prescription, accordingly requiring that t lie one standard deviation above

Two points emerge, from both Table 1 and Plot 1. One is that the Bartlett approxi-
mation does surprisingly well (except at very small N , of order 1). The second is that the
Log likelihood approximation does surprisingly badly. For N
10 the diﬀerences are of
order 10%. The convergence towards agreement is clearly slow.

However P (n; λ) is deﬁned for integer n only. To make this set of discrete spikes look like a

for values of the continuous abscissa variable between n

Again, the Bartlett approximation does surprisingly well, and the lnL approximation
surprisingly badly. Furthermore, in this case it underestimates both errors, which will
inevitably lead to a smaller than desired coverage. (This could be remedied by adding
0.5 to each limit, to account for the discrete binning, though this is still worse than the
Bartlett approximation, as can be seen from Table 2.)

The inaccurary of the logarithmic method is appreciable. For reasonable values of N
it is generally wrong in the second signiﬁcant ﬁgure, and often pretty grossly wrong. That
this occurs for both cases examined suggests that this is true in general. And yet values
obtained by this method are frequently quoted to considerable precision by experiments.
In the complicated likelihood functions used in real experimental results, a simple
Bartlett approach may not be possible. However the logarithmic approximation clearly
does not provide the accuracy with which experiments wish to report their results. An
alternative, available today but not in the 1950’s when these techniques were developed,
is to use the known Likelihood function to perform the Neyman construction using Monte
Carlo integration (the so-called ‘toy Monte Carlo’). This should be strongly recommended.

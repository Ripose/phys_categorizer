We present an extensive statistical analysis of the results of all sports competitions in ﬁve major
sports leagues in England and the United States. We characterize the parity among teams by the
variance in the winning fraction from season-end standings data and quantify the predictability of
games by the frequency of upsets from game results data. We introduce a mathematical model in
which the underdog team wins with a ﬁxed upset probability. This model quantitatively relates the
parity among teams with the predictability of the games, and it can be used to estimate the upset
frequency from standings data. We propose the likelihood of upsets as a measure of competitiveness.

What is the most competitive team sport? We answer
this question via a statistical survey of game results [1,
2, 3, 4]. We relate parity with predictability, and propose
the likelihood of upsets as a measure of competitiveness.
We studied the results of all regular season competi-
tions in 5 major professional sports leagues in England
and the United States (table I): the premier soccer league
of the English Football Association (FA), Major League
Baseball (MLB), the National Hockey League (NHL),
the National Basketball Association (NBA), and the Na-
tional Football League (NFL). NFL data includes the
short-lived AFL. We considered only complete seasons,
with more than 300,000 games in over a century [5].

The winning fraction, the ratio of wins to total games,
quantiﬁes team strength. Thus the distribution of win-
ning fraction measures the parity between teams in a
league. We computed F (x), the fraction of teams with a
winning fraction of x or lower at the end of the season, as

ning fraction. Here

and all years using season-end standings. For example,
in baseball where the winning fraction x typically falls
between 0.400 and 0.600, the variance is σ = 0.084. As
shown in ﬁgures 1 and 2a, the winning fraction distribu-
tion clearly distinguishes the ﬁve leagues. It is narrowest
for baseball and widest for football.

games played by a team in a season (hgamesi), variance in
the win-percentage distribution (σ), measured frequency of
upsets (q), and upset probability obtained using the theoreti-
cal model (qmodel). The fraction of ties in soccer, hockey, and
football is 0.246, 0.144, and 0.016, respectively.

FIG. 1: Winning fraction distribution (curves) and the best-
ﬁt distributions from simulations of our model (circles). For
clarity, FA, that lies between MLB and NHL, is not displayed.

Do these results imply that MLB games are the most
competitive and NFL games the least? Not necessarily!
The length of the season is a signiﬁcant factor in the
variability in the winning fraction. In a scenario where
the outcome of a game is completely random, the to-
tal number of wins performs a simple random walk, and
the standard deviation σ is inversely proportional to the
square root of the number of games played. Generally,
the shorter the season, the larger σ. Thus, the small
number of games is partially responsible for the large
variability observed in the NFL.

To account for the varying season length and reveal the
true nature of the sport, we set up mock sports leagues
where teams, paired at random, play a ﬁxed number of
games. In this simulation model, the team with the bet-
ter record is considered as the favorite and the team with
the worse record is considered as the underdog. The out-
come of a game depends on the relative team strengths:
with the “upset probability” q < 1/2, the underdog wins,
but otherwise, the favorite wins. Our analysis of the non-
linear master equations that describe the evolution of the
distribution of team win/loss records shows that σ de-
creases both as the season length increases and as games
become more competitive, i.e., as q increases [6].

the winning fraction distribution is uniform in the range
q < x < 1

q and as a result, σ = (1/2

q)/√3.

We run Monte Carlo simulations of these artiﬁcial
sports leagues, with sport-speciﬁc number of games and
a range of q values. We then determine the value of q
that gives the best match between the distribution F (x)
from the simulations to the actual sports statistics (ﬁg-
ure 1). Generally, we ﬁnd good agreement between the
simulations results and the data for reasonable q values.
To characterize the predictability of games, we followed
the chronologically-ordered results of all games and re-
constructed the league standings at any given day. We
then measured the upset frequency q by counting the
fraction of times that the team with the worse record
on the game date actually won (table I). Games between
teams with no record (start of a season) or teams with
equal records were disregarded. Game location was ig-
nored and so was the margin of victory. In soccer, hockey,
and football, ties were counted as 1/2 of a victory for
both teams. We veriﬁed that handling ties this way did
not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the results: the upset probability
changes by at most 0.02 (and typically, much less) if ties
are ignored.

We ﬁnd that soccer and baseball are the most com-
petitive sports with q = 0.452 and q = 0.441, respec-
tively, while basketball and football, with nearly identical
q = 0.365 and q = 0.364, are the least. There is also good

2

agreement between the upset probability qmodel, obtained
by ﬁtting the winning fraction distribution from numer-
ical simulations of our model to the data as in ﬁgure 1,
and the measured upset frequency (table I). Consistent
with our theory, the variance σ mirrors the bias, 1/2
q
(ﬁgures 2a and 2b). Tracking the evolution of either q
or σ leads to the same conclusion: NFL and MLB games
are becoming more competitive, while over the past 60
years, FA displays an opposite trend.

−

In summary, we propose a single quantity, q, the
frequency of upsets, as an index for quantifying the
predictability, and hence the competitiveness of sports
games. We demonstrated the utility of this measure via a
comparative analysis that shows that soccer and baseball
are the most competitive sports. Trends in this measure
may reﬂect the gradual evolution of the teams in response
to competitive pressure [7], as well as changes in game
strategy or rules [8].

Our model, in which the stronger team is favored to
win a game [6], enables us to take into account the vary-
ing season length and this model directly relates par-
ity, as measured by the variance σ with predictability, as
measured by the upset likelihood q. This connection has
practical utility as it allows one to conveniently estimate
the likelihood of upsets from the more easily-accessible
standings data. In our theory, all teams are equal at the
start of the season, but by chance, some end up strong
and some weak. Our idealized model does not include the
notion of innate team strength; nevertheless, the spon-
taneous emergence of disparate-strength teams provides
the crucial mechanism needed for quantitative modeling
of the complex dynamics of sports competitions.

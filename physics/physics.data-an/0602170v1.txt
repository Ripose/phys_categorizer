INTRODUCTION

Particle identiﬁcation(PID) is important in high energy physics experiments, and it mainly refers to charged par-

ticles. Diﬀerent techniques[1, 2, 3, 4]are used to study this problem. In this paper, the problem is analysed with

Bayes’ theorem of probability theory. It is well known that the best classiﬁcation methods are based on Bayesian

techniques if all the probability distributions are known[5]. However, from a literature survey, it appears that how to

use Bayesian technique in PID problem has not yet been thoroughly investigated[6, 7].

Diﬀerent detectors use diﬀerent variables to do PID, such as TOF t from TOF detector, dE/dx from wire chamber,

deposited energy E from shower counter, Cherenkov radiation emission angle θ from RICH counter, the deposited

energy W or transition radiation(TR) photon hits N from TR detector, etc. For diﬀerent particles with same
momentum, the random variables(t, dE/dx, E, θ, W , N etc) 1 may have diﬀerent distributions which can be used

for PID, therefore in this paper we call the random variables PID variables. Sometimes more than one PID variables

which have diﬀerent character can be obtained from one detector, such as in shower counter, both the deposited

energy E of a shower and one or two variables which describe the shape of the shower can be used for electron/hadron

separation.

respectively.

For an unknown charged particle, its momentum is usually known(e.g., given by drift chamber). Therefore, all

the calculations of probabilities in this paper are under the condition that the particle’s momentum vector is known

and indicated with p, θ and φ which are magnitude, polar and azimuthal angles of the particle’s momentum vector

The paper is organized as follows: In section two, the PID problem is analysed with Bayesian technique when

there is only one PID variable (use TOF t as example)is obtained for an unknown charged particle. In section three,

similar analysis is done when two and more PID variables(use TOF t and the deposited energy E in shower counter

as example)are available. Section four is the conlusions.

II. CASE FOR ONE PID VARIABLE

For a ﬁxed momentum denoted with the parameters p, θ and φ, P (i)(i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are used to represent the
appearing probabilities of particle e+, µ+, π+, K+, p+(or e−, µ−, π−, K−, p−) 2 respectively, because ﬁve kinds of

particles can have the same parameters’ values p, θ, φ. Here and below, i and j are used to represent one particle in
e+, µ+, π+, K+, p+ or e−, µ−, π−, K−, p−. And because only ﬁve kinds of particle can be the unknown particle, the

appearing probabilities should be normalized to unit for the ﬁxed momentum:

5

X
i=1

P (i) = 1.

if some kind particle does not appear, the corresponding P (i) = 0; and if the number of charged particle kinds is

larger than ﬁve(e.g., cosmic rays or particles from nuclear reaction), the sum terms will exceed ﬁve.

When there is only one PID variable(e.g. TOF t), what we know is the TOF t of the unknown charged particle

i) which is the probability of TOF t, given that the unknown charged particle is
and the conditional probability P (t
|
i. 3 From the point of view of probability theory, only the probability that the unknown charged particle is i can be

determined. Then the PID problem can be written as follows:

Given the momentum of the unknown charged particle and P (t

i), calculate P (i
|

t),
|

where P (i

t) is the conditional probability that the unknown charged particle is i, given that the TOF of the unknown
|

charged particle is t. In the light of the deﬁnition of conditional probability and Bayes’ theorem, we have

where P (j) is the appearing probability of the charged particle j, P (t) is the probability that TOF t occurs, and fj(t)

is the probability density function(p.d.f.) of variable t for the charged particle j. The denominator in equation(2) is

the normalizing constant which only makes P (i

t) have the probability meaning. The probability P (i
|

t) is proportional
|

to fi(t)P (i) in which fi(t) is determined by the detector, while P (i) has no concern with any detector. The p.d.f. for

TOF t is usually a Gaussian distribution, i.e.

fi(t) =

]

where σi is the resolution of TOF for the charged particle i, ti0 is the expected value of TOF for the charged particle

i. The general result for above pattern recognition can be easily found[5].

According to the physical meaning of P (i

for the unknown charged particle is i which makes P (i

t) have been calculated, the reasonable hypothesis

t) the largest in the ﬁve values. For any other PID variable

used for PID variable X. But the PID variable X may not have a Gaussian distribution for every i as TOF t has in

equation(3). For example, the deposited energy E of a ﬁxed momentum electron in EM shower counter has Gaussian

distribution, while for π,K, the deposited energy usually has not.

In equation(2), the p.d.f.s fi(t) (or P (t

i)) can be obtained from calibration of the detector. Thus the appear-
|

ing probability(or prior probability)P (i) is the only unknown quantity. And it is P (i) that makes PID problem

complicatedly because P (i) varies with studied ﬁnal states. Here, we give some remarks on P (i).

3

1. P (i) is the appearing probability of the charged particle i for studied ﬁnal state and the momentum vector(p,

θ, φ). This means diﬀerent ﬁnal states have diﬀerent P (i), while diﬀerent cuts(e.g. charged track number) in

analysis result in diﬀerent ﬁnal states. For example, if all events of J/ψ decay are considered, we get a set of P (i)

for the momentum vector (p, θ, φ); for the same momentum vector (p, θ, φ), if only those four-charged-tracks

events from J/ψ decay are considered, we will obtain another set of P (i). But why do we need a second set of

P (i)? In fact, the second set of P (i) can be used to enhance the eﬃciency of PID when we select the events

which only have four charged hadron tracks. In the four-charged-tracks events of J/ψ decay, the appearing

probabilities of leptons (e, µ) are by far less than that of hadrons(π, K, p). If the second set of P (i) is used to

select events, the aﬀection of leptons will be reduced greatly. Therefore, analyses which use corresponding P (i)

will have better event selecting. After a series of cuts are used to obtain P (i), the correct use of P (i) is that

the cuts used in the event selecting should not be looser than those cuts used in obtainning P (i), because the

P (i) can not be used to select the events which do not belong to the corresponding ﬁnal state. Once P (i) has

been ﬁgured out, it is not necessary to to change it when a new analysis is performed so long as the conditions

which determine P (i) do not change.

2. P (i) can be obtained from M.C. process. But a more reliable way of obtainning P (i) is recurrence approach in

real data. M.C. results or theoretical values(if any) can be used as initial values.

3. If the diﬀerence between P (i) is not large, PID will mainly rely on the inherent PID capability of detector, i.e.,

p.d.f.s of PID variable(e.g., fi(t) in equation(2)). And if the diﬀerence between σi is neglected, we derive the

conventional PID method(for TOF detector) which is only the contribution of exponential part(the weight of

the unknown charged particle to be particle i) in equation(3):

Wi = exp[

(t

ti0)2

−

−
2σ2
i

]

(4)

However, the diﬀerence between P (i) can not be neglected at will. For example, in the ﬁnal states of J/ψ decay,
diﬀerence between the appearing probabilities of π±, K ± varies with momentum from several to ten times[8].

So it is valuable and more accurate to consider the eﬀect of P (i) when large diﬀerence between P (i) exists.

For example, if the weights of an unknown particle to π, K are equal, i.e., W3 = W4, one may have no idea of

what the unknown particle is. But arccording to equation(2), the probability which the unknown particle is π

is several to ten times larger than the probability which the unknown particle is K. Furthermore, if W3 < W4,

the particle will be identiﬁed to be K, but P (3

t) > P (4
|

t) may occur because P (3) > P (4), this suggests that
|

the unknown particle is more likely to π. Finally, if one does not use P (i), one may have set all P (i) a same

value(equals 0.2)[7] which is groundless.

4. PID problem will become troublesome if P (i) depends on three parameters (p, θ, φ). To reduce the number of

the parameters is favourite. For ﬁnal states come from the colliders which have equal energy particle and anti-

particle colliding, it is not diﬃcult to ﬁnd that P (i) is independent of polar angle φ because of axis symmetry,

and because there are all kinds of channels in one ﬁnal state(e.g. J/ψ decay or four-charged-tracks ﬁnal state

in J/ψ decay), P (i) may be independent of azimuthal angle θ. Thus, for the ﬁnal states from most colliders,

if the cuts of obtainning P (i) are loose enough, P (i) may only depend on one parameter p, the magnitude of

momentum vector. In applications, the particle’s possible momentum region can be divided into many small

regions (e.g. 50MeV/c or less for a region’s width). For every region, we have ﬁve values P (i). Then, for an

unknown charged particle, P (i

t) in which we are interested can be calculated.

III. CASE FOR TWO AND MORE PID VARIABLES

When there are two PID variables(e.g. TOF t and the deposited energy E in EM shower counter) for one unknown

charged particle, then the PID problem can be written as follows:

Given the momentum of the unknown charged particle, P (t

i) and P (E
|

i), calculate P (i
|

t, E),
|

where E is the measured value of the deposited energy in shower counter, P (E

the deposited energy is E given that the unknown charged particle is i, and P (i

i) is the conditional probability that
|

t, E) is the conditional probability
|

that the unknown charged particle is i, given that TOF t and the deposited energy E occur simultaneously. By virtue

of the deﬁnition of conditional probability, we have again

P (i

t, E) =
|

P (i, t, E)
P (t, E)

=

P (t, E

i)P (i)
|
P (t, E)

where P (i, t, E) is simultaneous occurrence probability of i,t and E; P (t, E) is the probability that TOF t and the

deposited energy E occur simultaneously; P (t, E

i) is the conditonal probability that TOF t and the deposited energy
|

E occur simultaneously given that the unknown charged particle is i. Because measurements of TOF t and the

deposited energy E are independent, we have

P (t, E

i) = P (t
|

i)P (E
|

i)
|

Here, it should be noted that the situation of variable E is not the same as that of TOF t, the probability that E = 0

may not be inﬁnitesimal because of ﬁnite sensitivity of the detector, i.e. the distribution of E is not a pure continuous

distribution, but a mixed one:

where gi(E) is the p.d.f. of variable E for the charged particle i when the deposited energy E > 0. If E = 0 for the

unknown charged particle, then

Obviously, it is not diﬃcult to generalize above calculation to the case of many independent PID variables. Two

PID variables from two diﬀerent detectors are usually independent. Furthermore, the method can be used all the

same when a PID variable has discrete distribution (e.g. µ-detector hits probability), and using it is straightforward

IV. CONCLUSIONS

By employing Bayes’ theorem of probability theory, we have clariﬁed the usage of all types of PID information.

The corresponding applicable method to PID problem is also proposed. The method has some attracting properties.

First, the ﬁnal results (e.g., P (i

t), P (i
|

t, E)) are probabilities which have deﬁnite physical meaning. Second, when
|

one PID varibale has no-Gaussian distribution (e.g. Landau distribution of dE/dx), this method can be used as well.

Finally, the conventional PID method can be derived from it after some approximation.

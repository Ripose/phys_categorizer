Bayesian Analysis of the Conditional Correlation Between

Stock Index Returns with Multivariate SV Models

∗

Department of Econometrics, Cracow University of Economics

In the paper we compare the modelling ability of discrete-time multi-
variate Stochastic Volatility models to describe the conditional correlations
between stock index returns. We consider four trivariate SV models, which
diﬀer in the structure of the conditional covariance matrix. Speciﬁcations
with zero, constant and time-varying conditional correlations are taken into
account. As an example we study trivariate volatility models for the daily
log returns on the WIG, S&P 500, and FTSE 100 indexes.
In order to
formally compare the relative explanatory power of SV speciﬁcations we
use the Bayesian principles of comparing statistic models. Our results are
based on the Bayes factors and implemented through Markov Chain Monte
Carlo techniques. The results indicate that the most adequate speciﬁca-
tions are those that allow for time-varying conditional correlations and that
have as many latent processes as there are conditional variances and co-
variances. The empirical results clearly show that the data strongly reject
the assumption of constant conditional correlations.

1. Introduction

There are a lot of theoretical and empirical reasons to study multivari-
ate volatility models. Analysis of ﬁnancial market volatility and correla-
tions among markets play a crucial role in ﬁnancial decision making (e.g.
hedging strategies, portfolio allocations, Value-at-Risk calculations). The
correlations among markets are very important in the global portfolio di-
versiﬁcation.

The main aim of the paper is to compare the modelling ability of discrete-
time Multivariate Stochastic Volatility (MSV) models to describe the condi-
tional correlations and volatilities of stock index returns. The MSV models
oﬀer powerful alternatives to multivariate GARCH models in accounting
for properties of the conditional variances and correlations. Superior per-
formance of bivariate SV models over GARCH models (in term of the Bayes
factor) are documented in [8]. But the MSV models are not as often used
in empirical applications as the GARCH models. The main reason is that
the SV models are more diﬃcult to estimate. In this paper we consider four
multivariate Stochastic Volatility models, including the speciﬁcation with
zero, constant and time-varying conditional correlations. These MSV speci-
ﬁcations are used to model volatilities and conditional correlations between
stock index returns. We study trivariate volatility models for the daily log
returns on the WIG index, the Standard & Poor’s 500 index, and the FTSE
100 index for the period January 4, 1999 to December 30, 2005. In the next
section the Bayesian statistical methodology is brieﬂy presented . In section
3 the model framework is introduced. Section 4 is devoted to the descrip-
tion of trivariate SV speciﬁcations. In section 5 we present and discuss the
empirical results.

2. Bayesian statistical methodology

Let y be the observation matrix and θi be the vector of unknown pa-
rameters and ωi the latent variable vector in model Mi (i = 1, 2, . . . , n).
The i - the Bayesian model is characterized by the joint probability density
function, which can be written as the product of three densities:

p(y, ωi, θi

y(0), Mi) = p(y

ωi, θi, y(0), Mi)p(ωi

Θi are given, p(ωi
|
the latent variables conditioned on θi, p(θi
Mi) is the prior density function

under Mi. The joint probability density function can be expressed as the
product of the marginal data density of the observation matrix (given the
initial conditions y(0)) in model Mi: p(y
y(0), Mi), and the posterior density
|
function of the parameter vector θi and the latent variable vector ωi in Mi:

The statistical inference is based on the posterior distributions, while the
marginal densities p(y
y(0), Mi) (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) are the crucial components
|
in model comparison.
Assume that M1, . . . , Mn are mutually exclusive (non-nested) and jointly
exhaustive models. From Bayes’s theorem, it is easy to show that the pos-
terior probability of Mi is given by:

p(Mi

y, y(0)) =
|

p(Mi)p(y
n
i=1 p(Mi)p(y

y(0), Mi)
|

y(0), Mi)
|

,

P

where p(Mi) denotes the prior probability of Mi. For the sake of pairwise
comparison, we use the posterior odds ratio, which for any two models Mi
and Mj is equal to the prior odds ratio times the ratio of the marginal data
densities:

p(Mi
p(Mj

y, y(0))
|
y, y(0))
|

=

p(Mi)
p(Mj) ·

p(y
p(y

y(0), Mi)
|
y(0), Mj)
|

.

The ratio of the marginal data densities is called the Bayes factor:

Bij =

p(y
p(y

y(0), Mi)
|
y(0), Mj)
|
Thus, assuming equal prior model probabilities (i.e. p(Mi) = p(Mj)), the
Bayes factor is equal to the posterior odds ratio. We see that the values
of the marginal data densities for each model are the main quantities for
Bayesian model comparison. The marginal data density in model Mi can
be written as:

.

p(y

y(0), Mi) =
|

(cid:18)ZΩi×Θi h

ωi, θi, y(0), Mi)
|
i

p(ωi, θi

y, y(0), Mi)dωidθi(cid:19)
|

−1

−1

Of course, in the case of SV models this integral can not be evaluated
analytically and thus must be computed by numerical methods. We use
the method proposed by [6], which approximates the marginal data density
by the harmonic mean of the values p(y
ωi, θi, y(0), Mi), calculated for the
|
observed matrix y and for the vector (ω(q)

Competing trivariate SV models are deﬁned by imposing diﬀerent structures
on Σt.
For all elements of δ and R we assume the multivariate standardized Normal
prior N (0, I15), truncated by the restriction that all eigenvalues of R lie
inside the unit circle. We assume that the matrix [δ, R] and the remaining
(model-speciﬁc) parameters are prior independent.

4.1. Stochastic Discount Factor Model (SDF)

The ﬁrst speciﬁcation considered here is the stochastic discount factor
model (SDF) proposed, but not applied, by [4]. The SDF process is deﬁned

where Ωt(1) = ht. The conditional covariance matrix of ξt is time varying
and stochastic, but all its elements have the same dynamics governed by
ht. Consequently, the conditional correlation coeﬃcients are constant over
time. Our model speciﬁcation is completed by assuming the following prior
structure:

trix B. The initial condition for ln ht (i.e. ln h0) is treated as an additional
parameter and estimated jointly with other parameters.

4.2. Basic Stochastic Volatility Model (BSV)

Next, we consider the basic stochastic volatility process (BSV), where
N (0[3×1], Σt), and Σt = Diag(h1,t, h2,t, h3,t) (similar to the idea

we propose a SV process based on the spectral decomposition of the matrix

The next speciﬁcation (proposed by [13], thus called TSV) uses six sepa-

number of distinct elements of the conditional covariance matrix). Following

Note that positive deﬁniteness of Σt is achieved by modelling ln qjj,t instead
of qjj,t . It is easy to show that if the absolute values of φij are less than
one the TSV process is a white noise (see [10]). We see that the TSV model
is able to model both the time-varying conditional correlation coeﬃcients
and variances of returns. A major drawback of this process is that the
conditional variances and covariances are not modelled in a symmetric way,
thus the explanatory power of model may depend on the ordering of ﬁnancial
instruments.
We assume the following prior distributions:

5. Empirical results

We consider daily stock index returns for three national markets: Poland
(WIG), the United States (S&P 500), and the United Kingdom (FTSE 100),
from January 4, 1999 to December 30, 2005. We consider only index clos-
ing quotations in trading days for all considered national markets, thus our
sample consists of 1701 daily observations 1. The ﬁrst observation is used to
construct initial conditions. Thus T, the length of the modelled vector time
series, is equal to 1700. In Table 1 we present the decimal logarithms of the
Bayes factors in favor of T SVF SW model. Our posterior results are obtained
using MCMC methods: Metropolis-Hastings within the Gibbs sampler (see
[11], [7] and [3]). The results presented in this paper are based on 500, 000
states of the Markov chain, generated after 100, 000 burnt-in states. The

Bayes factors are calculated using the Newton and Raftery’s method [6]. Be-
cause in the TSV speciﬁcation the conditional variances are not modelled
in a symmetric way, we consider six cases: T SVF SW , T SVF W S, T SVSW F ,
T SVSF W , T SVW F S, and T SVW SF . These models diﬀer in ordering of el-
ements in yt. For example in the T SVF SW model y1,t denotes the daily
growth rate of the FTSE 100 index at day t, and y2,t and y3,t are respec-
tively the daily growth rates of the S&P 500 and the WIG indexes at day t.
Our ﬁndings show clear superiority of the TSV speciﬁcations (which de-
scribe the six distinct elements of the conditional covariance matrix by six
separate latent processes) over all SV models considered here. The T SVF SW
model receives almost all posterior probability mass (assuming equal prior
model probabilities), being about 7.82 orders of magnitude more probable
a posterior than the T SVF W S model and 63.68 orders of magnitude better
than the JSV model. Furthermore, the T SVW SF model ﬁts the data about
23 orders of magnitude worse than the best TSV model. It is mainly at-
tributed to the fact that the growth rates of the FTSE index are less volatile
than the S&P and WIG indexes. When we compare the unconditional vari-
, j = 1, 2, 3) obtained
ance of ξj,t (V ar(ξj,t) = exp
in the BSV model, we observe a value of 1.448 for the WIG index, 0.955
for the S&P 500 index and 0.943 for the FTSE index. It is in accordance
with the ordering of returns in the best TSV model. Thus, the explanatory
power of the SV model depends not only on the number of latent processes,
but also on the ordering of ﬁnancial instruments in case of the TSV speci-
ﬁcations. The results indicate that the return rates of the WIG, S&P and
FTSE indexes reject the constant or zero conditional correlation hypothesis,
represented by the SDF and BSV model.

The main characteristics of the posterior distributions of the conditional
correlation coeﬃcients are presented in Figure 1, where the upper line rep-
resents the posterior mean plus standard deviation the lower one - the poste-
rior mean minus standard deviation. The conditional correlation coeﬃcients
produced by our VAR(1)-SV models with at least three latent processes vary
markedly over time. Surprisingly, the TSV models with diﬀerent ordering
of the returns lead to diﬀerent posterior inference on the conditional co-
variances. The diﬀerences in the dynamics of conditional correlations are
understandable because of the structure of the conditional covariance ma-
trix. In the TSV models the conditional covariance between ξ1,t and ξ2,t
(similarly between ξ1,t and ξ3,t) depends on the variance of ξ1,t (i.e. q11,t).
Thus, a large increase in the conditional variance of ξ1,t leads to an increase
in the conditional covariance. Therefore the T SVW SF and T SVW F S models
(in which the WIG index is the ﬁrst component) lead to similar inference
on the dynamics of the conditional correlations. The plots of the posterior
means of ρij,t, obtained in the remaining TSV models are diﬀerent (be-
cause of diﬀerences in volatilities of the S&P500, FTSE indexes and WIG
index). Note also that in the JSV model the latent processes that describe
volatilities are included in the conditional correlation coeﬃcient deﬁnitions.
Consequently, the conditional correlations depend on the volatilities. Sur-
prisingly, in the SDF model the conditional correlations are estimated very
precisely - the posterior standard deviations of ρij,t are relatively small. The
returns on the WIG index are lower correlated with returns on the S&P 500
index (with an average of 0.18) than with returns on the FTSE index (with
an average of 0.24). This low correlation is partially explained by the non -
overlapping trading hours of U.S. market with the European markets. The
U.S. market (represented by the S&P 500 index) has the average correla-
tion of 0.47 with the U.K. market. Finally, it is important to stress that our
results show that the conditional correlations are not signiﬁcantly higher
when world markets are down trending, which is in contrast to the results
presented in the papers: [1], [12], [5].

We propose a new test statistic based on a score process for determining the statistical signiﬁcance of a
putative signal that may be a small perturbation to a noisy experimental background. We derive the reference
distribution for this score test statistic; it has an elegant geometrical interpretation as well as broad applicability.
We illustrate the technique in the context of a model problem from high-energy particle physics. Monte Carlo
experimental results conﬁrm that the score test results in a signiﬁcantly improved rate of signal detection.

One of the fundamental problems in the analysis of
experimental data is determining the statistical sig-
niﬁcance of a putative signal. Such a problem can be
cast in terms of classical “hypothesis testing”, where
H0 describes the background and
a null hypothesis
an alternative hypothesis
H1 characterizes the signal
together with the background. A test statistic (a func-
tion of the data) is used to decide whether to reject
H0 and conclude that a signal is present.
The hypothesis test concludes that a signal is present
whenever the test statistic falls in a critical region
W . One is interested in the probability that a sig-
nal is found under two scenarios. First, when the null
hypothesis
H0 is true, the signiﬁcance level α is the
probability of incorrectly concluding that a signal is
H1 is true, the
present. Second, when the alternative
power of the test is the probability that the signal is
found. The goal is to construct a test statistic whose
asymptotic distribution (reference distribution under
H0 for large sample size) can be calibrated accurately
and that the associated test has high power at a ﬁxed
signiﬁcance level, such as α = 0.01.

When the two hypotheses are distinct, a powerful
technique based on the likelihood ratio test (LRT) is
often used. Suppose p(x; θ) is a probability density
function for a measurement x with a parameter vector
d. The joint probability density function

the more complicated alternative model under
H1
(with s1 parameters). For simple models, under reg-
ularity conditions, 2 log(Λ) is distributed as the χ2
s0) degrees of freedom under
distribution with (s1 −
H0 [1].
When the alternative hypothesis corresponds to a sig-
nal which is a perturbation of the background, reg-
ularity conditions required for this asymptotic the-
ory are violated, since (a) some of the parameters
under
H0 are on the boundaries of their region of
support and (b) different parameter values give rise
to the same null model. As a result, the LRT has
lacked an analytically tractable reference distribution
required to calibrate a test statistic. Such a difﬁculty
occurs in many practical applications, for example,
when testing for a new particle resonance of unknown
production cross section as the signal strength must
be nonnegative. Hence, the LRT must be employed
cautiously; however, it has been employed in several
problems of practical importance where certain re-
quired regularity conditions are violated [2]. An in-
appropriate application of the LRT statistics can lead
to incorrect scientiﬁc conclusions [4,5].

In light of the above difﬁculties with the LRT, a χ2
goodness-of-ﬁt test is commonly employed. How-
ever, it typically has less power than might be hoped
for as it does not take into account information about
the anticipated form of the signal. We propose a new
test statistic based on a score process to detect the
presence of a signal and present its reference distri-
bution. This score statistic is closely related to the
LRT for sufﬁciently large sample size.

Consider the model

p(x; η, θ) = (1

η) f (x) + η ψ(x; θ),

−

∈

where f (x) is a speciﬁed null density and ψ(x, θ)
is a perturbation density. The parameter vector θ
is the “location” of the perturbation, and η
[0, 1]
measures the “strength of the perturbation”. The null
hypothesis of no signal (
H0 : η = 0) implies that
p(x; 0, θ) = f (x) for all x independently of θ; hence
we are in the scenario (b). In searching for a new par-
ticle resonance, for example, one measures the fre-
quency of events as a function of energy E, model-
ing it by p(E; η, E0), where f (E) characterizes the
background density and ψ(E; E0) = [Γ/(2 π)][(E
−
E0)2 + (Γ/2)2]−1 is the Cauchy (Breit-Wigner) den-
sity describing a resonance centered on E0 with full
width at half-maximum Γ. In this scenario, η = 0
under
H0 and hence the asymptotic distribution of
H0 does not have an asymptotic χ2
2 log(Λ) under
distribution. The asymptotic reference distribution is
not analytically tractable, and hence it is not possi-
ble to employ its measured value for valid statistical
inference.

A key obstacle to detecting the signal is ﬁnding the
tail probability. We provide an asymptotic solution
to this problem via a geometric formula (see Eq. [3]).
The relative improvement of the score test over the
χ2 goodness-of-ﬁt test is particularly salient when the
signal is hard to detect (see Fig. 4). The development
of the reference distribution and a ﬂexible computa-
tional method will enable making probabilistic state-
ments to solving some of the fundamental problems
arising in many experimental physics.

Pilla and Loader [6] have developed a general theory
and a computationally ﬂexible method to determine
the asymptotic reference distribution of a test statis-
tic under
H0. Their method is based on the “score
process”, indexed by the parameter vector θ and de-
n

for
a given data E = (E1, . . . , En). Under
H0, the ex-
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
pectation of S(θ) is 0 for all θ, while under
H1 it has
a peak at the true value of θ. Hence, the statistic S(θ)
is sensitive to the signal of interest. The random vari-
ability of S(θ) can exhibit signiﬁcant dependence on
the parameter vector θ, hence we consider the nor-
malized score process deﬁned as

the covariance function C(θ, θ†) in Eq. [2] for S(θ)

in special cases, this distribution cannot be expressed

with respect to θ and θ† respectively. The expres-
sion for ζ1 is similar except that integration is over the
boundary of the manifold. The remaining constants
involve curvature of the manifold and its boundaries,
and become progressively more complex. However,
for practical problems the ﬁrst few terms will sufﬁce
and an implementation of the ﬁrst four terms is de-
scribed in [12]. When the reference distribution can
be approximated by a χ2 distribution, then a tabulated
value can be employed to calibrate the test statis-
tic whereas the geometric constants appearing in the
above tail probability evaluation depend on the prob-
lem at hand. In this modern computer era, it is not
difﬁcult to compute them numerically [12].

In many applications, including the one considered
in this letter, one is interested in the probabilities of
rare events (i.e., c
). In this case, the terms in
Eq. (3) are of descending size, and the error term is
asymptotically negligible.

We demonstrate the power of the score test with

a Monte Carlo simulation experiment drawn from
high-energy physics. In our simulation, we consider
[0, 2] in
measurements of energy in a region E
which the background (null) density is modeled as
linear, with a speciﬁc form f (E) = (1/2.6) (1 +
0.3E). The resonance is modeled by a Breit-Wigner
density function. The parameters for this problem are
modeled following an example in Roe [13].

To examine the effectiveness of the test T in detecting
a signal, we perform Monte Carlo analyses of 10,000
samples each with a size of n = 1000 events spread
over 50 bins at the values of Γ = 0.2 and E0 = 1.
For a single simulated dataset, Fig. 2 shows the nor-
malized score surface as a function of E0 and Γ. It is
clear that the maximum is achieved at E0 = 1 irre-
spective of the value of Γ.

Abstract: It is revealed that distribution functions of practical gases relate
to singularities and such singularities can, with molecular motion, spread to
the entire region of interest. It is also shown that even common continuous
distribution functions involve a similar quasi-discontinuity diﬃculty.

It is widely assumed that the necessary and complete foundation of ki-
netic theory has been established and the main problem in this ﬁeld is the
lack of powerful computational means: if a suﬃciently large supercomputer
were available we would be able to solve the well-known Boltzmann-type
equations in terms of initial and boundary conditions and the behavior of
most practical gases would become analyzable and calculable[1][2]. In view
of that similar partial diﬀerential equations in ﬂuid mechanics can be han-
dled by today’s computers and the obtained results appear to be reasonably
good (to a certain extent), it seems that the aforementioned notion concern-
ing kinetic theory is indeed sound and cannot, thus should not, be challenged
seriously.

In studying several kinds of gases one, however, found that singularities
arose from the standard treatment[3]. Unlike singularities that exist for
usual partial diﬀerential systems, the observed singularities are not limited
to isolated regions; molecular motion carries them to nearby regions as well
as distant regions (though collisions between molecules erase them partly).
Being exposed to such diﬃculties, we no longer believe that the principal
way of studying kinetic gases is to have Boltzmann-type equations.

The purpose of this paper is to arouse concern for the singularity aspect
of the standard kinetic theory. We present realistic examples in that discon-
tinuous distribution functions come to exist and application of diﬀerential
operator to them becomes risky and misleading. Most of analyses are carried
out in terms of solving the collisionless Boltzmann equation numerically and
analytically. At the end we brieﬂy discuss in what way we may overcome
the diﬃculties revealed herein.

First of all, let us take a brief look at how the Boltzmann equation can

be solved in terms of the standard procedure. The equation reads

∂f
∂t

+ v ·

∂f
∂r

+

F
m

·

∂f
∂v

= Z [f (v′)f (v′

1) − f (v)f (v1)]uσdΩdv1,

(1)

where the left side is sometimes called the convective operator and the right
side the collisional operator. The detailed meaning of the notations related
to two operators can be found in any textbook[1][4]. To solve the diﬀerential-
integral equation, we must have the initial condition

f (t0 + 0, r, v) = f (t0, r, v)

and the boundary condition

f (t, r, v) = Z K(v, v1)f (t, r, v1)dv1,

2

(2)

(3)

where K(v, v1) represents the collisional nucleus between molecules and
boundaries[2][5]. According to the existing kinetic theory, these equations,
from (1) to (3), constitute a complete equation set to describe the gas dy-
namics. It is also noted that to numerically solve the equation set a ﬁnite-
diﬀerence scheme based on a grid arrangement in the position-velocity space,
such as

∂f
∂t

∼

∆f
∆t

∂f

,

∂f
∂vx

∼

should be employed. If all these are ready, we can, by means of a “true”
supercomputer, construct solutions for the equation set. For convenience of
later discussion, we will refer to the procedure outlined above, including the
equations and all the necessary mathematical treatments, as the standard
solution-construction scheme of the Boltzmann equation.

Enormous diﬃculties involve in the solution-construction scheme. What
have been well known include: (i) There are seven independent variables:
time, geometric coordinates, and velocity components. (ii) The collisional
operator is complicated in nature. Due to these diﬃculties, only much sim-
pliﬁed cases have been investigated (one-dimensional cases for instance). In
this paper, we put aside these well-known diﬃculties and try to discuss what
may happen when a suﬃciently powerful supercomputer is available and a
full-dimensional computational job is really performed.

For simplicity, we will disregard collisions between molecules. Never-
theless, the discussion in this paper should hold its signiﬁcance for rareﬁed
gases as well as for ordinary gases.

Consider a boundary in the gas shown in Fig. 1. Suppose that there
initially exists a density diﬀerence between the two sides of the boundary
and that the density on the left side is much larger. Obviously, molecules on
the left side will expand into the space on the right side. At any point on the
right side, we will surely ﬁnd out a certain amount of molecules that come
from the left side. By referring to Fig. 2a, we set up a local coordinate
system at a point p on the right side in such a way that the y-direction
is parallel to the boundary edge and molecules having passed by the edge
will move in the x-direction at the point. It is then simple to see that any
molecules that have velocities vz < 0 do not come from the left side of
the boundary. In Fig. 2b, we schematically plot the velocity distribution
at p, which illustrates that the distribution function at vz = 0 involves a
discontinuity

∂f
∂vz

= ∞.

If the z-component of the external force is not exactly zero (there is a gravita-
tional force, for instance) the convective operator in the Boltzmann equation
fails to make sense at vz = 0

∂f
∂t

+ v ·

∂f
∂r

+

F
m

·

∂f
∂v

= ∞.

The situation is rather worrisome since every spatial point on the right side
(as well as the left side) of the boundary involves exactly the same singularity
for exactly the same reason.

The singularity discussed above has some thing to do with external
forces. To have a complete picture, we will, in the remaining part of this
paper, investigate examples in that no external force exists.

We consider a gas leaking out of a container through a small hole, as
shown in Fig. 3, which schematically represents how a point-size source
emits molecules and how the emitted molecules spread out over a free space.
At this point, it is worth mentioning that the situation under consid-
eration is not particularly special. In addition to what happen to leaking
gases, there are many practical cases in that molecules behave like an out-
ﬂow from a point-like source. As shown in Fig. 4, a boundary surface cannot
be regarded as a uniform one owning to physical, chemical and geometric
diﬀerences on it; and this leaves us no choice but to divide the surface into
many small, inﬁnitesimally small according to the spirit of calculus, area
elements and examine how those elements reﬂect molecules. Due to the ﬁ-
nite temperature of the boundary, the “reﬂected” molecules from each of the
area element will spread as if they are emitted from a small hole. (Emission
patterns have been examined by Ref. 5, though from a somewhat diﬀerent
viewpoint.)

We ﬁrst apply the ordinary ﬂuid mechanics to the ﬂuid around the point
p in Fig. 3b. If we further assume that the gas container is rather large,
the outﬂow must be time-independent during the interested period, which
means

(7)

(8)

(9)

∂n
∂t
It is easy to ﬁnd that at the point p

= 0.

∂n
∂x

6= 0,

∂vx
∂x

= 0.

These expressions tell us that the usual ﬂuid equation

∂n
∂t

+ ∇(vn) = 0

4

does not hold.

Can the standard kinetic theory do better? The immediate concern is to
determine the distribution function related to the gas. By referring to Fig.
3b, in which the origin of the coordinate system is placed at the point-like
source, we ﬁnd that the distribution function can be expressed by

f (r, v, Ω) =

u(v)g(Ω)

r2

δ(Ω − Ωr),

(10)

where Ω is the solid angle of the velocity and Ωr is the solid angle of r in
the position space, u(v) stands for a function of v = |v|, which may, for
instance, be proportional to exp(−µv2/2) and g(Ω) represents a function of
Ω. In Eq. (10) the factor r−2 is due to the expansion of the molecular paths.
It is rather obvious that expression (10) can generally stand for an outﬂow
emitted by a point-size source. In terms of this distribution function, we
surely have, at the point p again,

and

∂f
∂t

= 0, F ·

∂f
∂v

= 0

v ·

∂f
∂r

6= 0.

(11)

(12)

Similar to what happens to the ﬂuid equation (9), the collisionless Boltz-
mann equation

+ v ·

+

= 0

(13)

∂f
∂t

∂f
∂r

is not valid.

When dealing with partial diﬀerential equations, it is customary to think
of singularity as something isolated in a certain domain. The singularities
revealed in this paper, however, are diﬀerent: the point p in Fig. 3, as well
as the point p in Fig. 2, is chosen rather arbitrarily, and this means such
singularities exist in the entire space of interest.

To see the deep root of the diﬃculty, we wish to continue our discussion
on one unusual behavior of continuous distribution function. The behavior
is well associated with the singularities that have just been discussed.

In Fig. 5, we schematically depict a gas. Suppose that in the shaded
region the density of molecules is signiﬁcantly larger than those in the nearby
regions (however, the continuity of the distribution function is still there).
Instead of using the standard solution-construction scheme, we try a slightly
diﬀerent, but analytically much more eﬀective, approach. Think about how

5

the distribution function at the point o inﬂuences the distribution function
at p1 and at p2. By relating r and v in the the collisionless Boltzmann
equation to those of a moving molecule, we can write the equation as

= 0,

(14)

df

dt(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)path

where the “path” implies that the diﬀerentiation is taken along a molecular
path in the position-velocity phase space. The solution of Eq. (14) is simply

f (t, r, v)|path = Constant.

(15)

In other words, we can link the distribution function at a certain point to
the distribution function at another point if the link exists in terms of a
molecule’s path. For the situation shown in Fig. 5a, we know that

f (t0, ro, v) = f (t1, rp1, v) = f (t2, rp2, v),

(16)

where v is the velocity of the moving molecule (no external force exists). In
terms of (16), we may say that o is the “source” point and p1 or p2 is the
“image” point.

The formulation above seems “exactly” consistent with the standard
approach. However, there are several things worth special mentioning. As
one thing, the path-information of molecules plays an active and essential
role in this approach while it is considered almost irrelevant in the equation
set (1)-(3). As another thing, this approach is less sensitive to singularities.
Equation (14) is an ordinary diﬀerential equation along a path and the
singularities associated with (5) and (6), for instance, do not spell much
trouble to it.

The resultant expression (14) or (15) brings out that, by referring to
the Fig. 5b, the local distribution functions at p1 and p2 have cone-like
structures. The structures are interesting in the following two senses. One
is that the cones become sharper and sharper constantly as the distance
between the source and the image increases. The other is that though the
initial variation of the distribution function is in the spatial space, the cone-
like structures are formed later on in the velocity spaces of other points.

In Fig. 6, we plot the distribution function versus the polar angle in the
velocity space. The ﬁgure clearly illustrates that with the increase of the
distance between the source and the image

∂f
∂θ

→ very large.

6

(17)

If the expression

∂f
∂θ

→ ∞

(18)

is allowed to characterize a true discontinuous distribution function, see
for instance expression (10), it should be appropriate to name the feature
related to (17) as the quasi-discontinuity.

It is now in order to comment on the applicability of the standard
solution-construction scheme outlined at the beginning of the discussion.
Equation (17) has shown that even if we assume that the distribution func-
tion under consideration is initially continuous and the gas is free from
boundary eﬀects, the standard scheme will still encounter diﬃculties. As
the cones of the velocity spaces become sharper and sharper, too sharp to
be described by the chosen grid arrangement, some kinds of δ-functions have
to be employed. In this sense, no approach is truly usable unless a way is
included in which both continuous and discontinuous distribution functions
are treated on a roughly equal footing.

Finally, we make a brief examination of possible direction in which the

revealed diﬃculties can be surmounted.

The discussions in this paper have shown that the most essential task
is to deal with continuous and discontinuous distribution functions in a
unifying way. After many unsuccessful tries, we are convinced that the task
can be accomplished by an integral procedure in that the path-information
of molecules plays an important role. The reasons for that include: (i)
Integral operations, unlike diﬀerential operations, are usually not sensitive to
discontinuity; if formulated adequately, the behavior of both discontinuous
and continuous distribution functions can be described. (ii) In discussing
the discontinuity and the quasi-discontinuity, we have seen that if the path-
information of molecules is made of use, the mental picture, as well as the
resultant formulas, becomes much clariﬁed.

Based on the conceptions aforementioned, we have developed a path-
integral approach[3][6] in that the singularity diﬃculties revealed in this
paper are removed. Best of all, some of full-dimensional practical gases
become calculable in terms of today’s computers.

by role-to-role connectivity proﬁles

Interactions between units in phyical, biological, technological, and social sys-

tems usually give rise to intrincate networks with non-trivial structure, which

critically affects the dynamics and properties of the system. The focus of most

current research on complex networks is on global network properties. A

caveat of this approach is that the relevance of global properties hinges on

the premise that networks are homogeneous, whereas most real-world net-

works have a markedly modular structure. Here, we report that networks

with different functions, including the Internet, metabolic, air transportation,

and protein interaction networks, have distinct patterns of connections among

nodes with different roles, and that, as a consequence, complex networks can

be classiﬁed into two distinct functional classes based on their link type fre-

quency. Importantly, we demonstrate that the above structural features can-

not be captured by means of often studied global properties.

The structure of complex networks 1,2 is typically characterized in terms of global prop-

erties, such as the average shortest path length between nodes 3, the clustering coefﬁcient 3,

the assortativity 4 and other measures of degree-degree correlations 5,6, and, especially, the de-

gree distribution 7,8. However, these global quantities are truly informative only when one of

1

two strict conditions is fulﬁlled: (i) the network lacks a modular structure 9,10,11,12,13,14, or (ii)

the network has a modular structure but (ii.a) all modules were formed according to the same

mechanisms, and therefore have similar properties, and (ii.b) the interface between modules is

statistically similar to the bulk of the modules, except for the density of links. If neither of these

two conditions is fulﬁlled, then any theory proposed to explain, for example, a scale-free degree

distribution needs to take into account the modular structure of the network.

To our knowledge, no real-world network has been shown to fulﬁll either of the two condi-

tions above; this implies that global properties may sometimes fail to provide insight into the

mechanisms responsible for the formation or growth of these networks. Alternative approaches

that take into consideration the modular structure of real-world complex networks are therefore

necessary. One such approach is to group nodes into a small number of roles, according to

their pattern of intra- and inter-module connections 11,12,13. Recently, we demonstrated that the

role of a node conveys signiﬁcant information about the importance of the node, and about the

evolutionary pressures acting on it 11,13. Here, we demonstrate that modular networks can be

classiﬁed into distinct functional classes according to the patterns of role-to-role connections,

and that the deﬁnition of link types can help us understand the function and properties of a

particular class of networks.

Modularity of complex networks

We analyze four different types of real-world networks—metabolic networks 11,15,16, protein in-

teractomes 17,18,19,20, global and regional air transportation networks 13,21,22, and the Internet at

the autonomous system (AS) level 5,23 (Table 1 and Supplementary discussion). To determine

and quantify the modular structure of these networks, we use simulated annealing 24 to ﬁnd

the optimal partition of the network into modules 11,12,25 (Methods). We then assess the signiﬁ-

cance of the modular structure of each network by comparing it to a randomization of the same

network 25. We ﬁnd that all networks studied have a signiﬁcant modular structure (Table 1).

Modules correspond to functional units in biological networks 11,20 and to geo-political units in

air transportation networks 13 and, probably, in the Internet 26.

2

To assess whether global average properties are appropriate to describe the structure of

these networks, we compare global average properties of the networks to the corresponding

module-speciﬁc averages; speciﬁcally, we focus on the degree, the clustering coefﬁcient, and

the normalized clustering coefﬁcient. We ﬁnd that the average degree of the network is not

representative of individual-module average degrees for air transportation networks (Table 2).

Most importantly, the global clustering coefﬁcient is not representative of individual-module

clustering coefﬁcients for any network (except, maybe, for one out of 18 metabolic networks).

Role-based description of complex networks

As an alternative to the average description approach, we determine the role of each node ac-

cording to two properties 11,12 (Methods): the relative within-module degree z, which quantiﬁes

how well connected a node is to other nodes in their module, and the participation coefﬁcient

P , which quantiﬁes to what extent the node connects to different modules. We classify as non-

hubs those nodes that have low within-module degree (z < 2.5). Depending on the fraction of

connections they have to other modules, non-hubs are further subdivided into 11,12: (R1) ultra-

peripheral nodes, that is, nodes with all their links within their own module; (R2) peripheral

nodes, that is, nodes with most links within their module; (R3) satellite connectors, that is,

nodes with a high fraction of their links to other modules; and (R4) kinless nodes, that is, nodes

with links homogeneously distributed among all modules. We classify as hubs those nodes that

have high within-module degree (z ≥ 2.5). Similar to non-hubs, hubs are divided according

to their participation coefﬁcient into: (R5) provincial hubs, that is, hubs with the vast majority

of links within their module; (R6) connector hubs, that is, hubs with many links to most of the

other modules; and (R7) global hubs, that is, hubs with links homogeneously distributed among

all modules.

Although the full rationale for this particular deﬁnition of the roles has been given else-

where 12, it is important to highlight a few properties of our classiﬁcation scheme. Nodes in real

and model networks, especially non-hubs, do not ﬁll uniformly the zP -plane; our role classiﬁ-

cation scheme arises from the fact that nodes tend to congregate into a small number of densely

3

populated regions of this space, with boundaries between these regions having low density of

nodes. Additionally, especially for hubs, boundaries coincide with well deﬁned connectivity

patterns; for example, nodes at the boundary between connector hubs (R6) and global hubs

(R7) would have approximately half of their links in one module, and the other half perfectly

spread in other modules. Importantly, other deﬁnitions of the roles do not alter the results we

report below (see Supplementary Information).

We investigate how our deﬁnition of roles relates to global network properties, and to what

extent global network properties are representative of nodes with different roles. Since some

simple properties like the degree and the clustering coefﬁcient trivially depend on a node’s role,

we focus on degree-degree correlations 4,5,19,27,28,6. Speciﬁcally, we address two questions: (i)

whether nodes with the same degree but different roles have the same or different correlations;

and (ii) to what extent the observed degree-degree correlations are a byproduct of the modular

structure of the network.

To answer these questions, we start by considering the Internet at the AS level (Fig. 1).

Nodes with degree k = 3 can be either ultra-peripheral (R1, if they have all connections in

the same module), peripheral (R2, if they have two connections in one module and one in

another), or satellite connectors (R3, if the three connections are to different modules). A
separate analysis for each role reveals that the average degree knn(k) of the neighbors of a

node 5 with degree k = 3 strongly depends on the role of the node. For an instance of the 1998
Internet, for example, knn(k = 3) = 43 ± 8 for ultra-peripheral nodes, knn(k = 3) = 196 ± 12
for peripheral nodes, and knn(k = 3) = 290 ± 20 for satellite connectors. We observe a

dependence of knn on the nodes’ role for all the networks studied here (Fig. 1a-d).

Regarding the second question, initial research showed 5 that for the Internet at the AS level
knn(k) ∝ k−0.5. It was later pointed out 28,27 that any network with the same degree distribution

as the Internet should display a similar scaling. In other words, the degree distribution of the

network is responsible for most of the observed correlations. However, the degree distribution

alone does not account for all the observed correlations 28 (Fig. 1e). In contrast, the modular

structure of the network does account for most of the remaining degree-degree correlations

observed in the topology of the Internet (Fig. 1i). Similarly, the modular structure accounts for

4

the degree-degree correlations in metabolic networks and the air transportation network, and

for most of the correlations in protein interaction networks (Fig. 1i-l).

Role-to-role connectivity proﬁles

The ﬁndings we reported so far suggest that, once the degree distribution and the modular struc-

ture are ﬁxed, real networks have no additional internal structure. This, however, contradicts our

intuition that networks with different growth mechanisms and functional needs should have dis-

tinct connection patterns between nodes playing different roles. To investigate this possibility,

we systematically analyze how nodes connect to one another depending on their roles.

For each network, we calculate the number rij of links between nodes belonging to roles i

and j, and compare this number to the number of such links in a properly randomized network

(Methods). As in previous work 19,29,28,30, we use the z-score to obtain a proﬁle ~a of over- and

under-representation of link types (Fig. 2), which enables us to compare different networks. We
quantify the overall similarity between two proﬁles ~a and ~b by the scalar product between these

proﬁles (Methods). In Fig. 2, we show that networks of the same type have highly correlated

proﬁles, while networks of different types have weaker correlations and, at times, even strong

anti-correlations (Fig. 2c).

The networks considered fall into two main classes, one comprising metabolic and air trans-

portation networks, and another comprising protein interactomes and the Internet. The main

difference between the two groups is the pattern of links between: (i) ultra-peripheral nodes

(links of type R1-R1), and (ii) connector hubs and other hubs (links of types R5-R6 and R6-

R6). These link types are over-represented for networks in the ﬁrst class (except links of type

R6-R6 in metabolic networks), and under-represented for networks in the second class.

We denote the ﬁrst class as the stringy-periphery class (Fig. 3a, b). In networks of this

class, ultra-peripheral nodes are more connected to one another than one would expect from

chance, which results in long “chains” of ultra-peripheral nodes. In metabolic networks, these

chains correspond to loop-less pathways that, for example, degrade a complex metabolite into

simpler molecules. In the air transportation network, due to the higher overall connectivity

5

of the network, chains contain short loops and resemble “braids.” Stringy-periphery networks

also have a core of hubs, which we call the hub oligarchy, that are directly reachable from

one another (links of type R5-R6 in metabolic and air transportation networks, and R6-R6 in

air transportation networks). Moreover, connector hubs are less connected to ultra-peripheral

nodes (R1) than expected by chance alone.

We denote the second class as the multi-star class (Fig. 3c, d). The multi-star class comprises

the protein interactomes and the Internet, and has the opposite signature to the stringy-periphery

class. Links of type R1-R1 (between ultra-peripheral nodes) are under-represented, whereas

links of type R1-R5 (between ultra-peripheral nodes and provincial hubs) are, over-represented,

giving rise to modules with indirectly-connected “star-like” structures. Similarly, connector

hubs are less connected to one another than one would expect, which means that these networks

depend on satellite connectors to bridge connector hubs and modules.

Our ﬁndings conﬁrm and clarify previous results in the literature. For example, the under-

representation of R6-R6 links in protein interactomes is consistent with previous results suggest-

ing a tendency for hubs to “repel” each other in these networks 19,6. Similarly, the role-to-role

connectivity proﬁle of the Internet is consistent with the existence of a hierarchy of types of

nodes 28. This hierarchy comprises end users, regional providers, and global providers, which

we hypothesize correspond correspond to roles R1-R2, R5, and R6 respectively. The role-to-

role connectivity proﬁles are consistent with a scenario in which end users connect mostly to

regional providers, and in which global providers connect with each other indirectly through

satellite connectors (R3), with few connections but probably large bandwidth.

By considering the modular structure of the networks and the extra dimension introduced by

the participation coefﬁcient, however, our approach provides novel insights into the relationship

between structure and function in complex networks. For example, by considering the absolute

degree alone nodes with roles R5 and R6 in protein interactomes are indistinguishable from

each other: in S. cerevisiae, hkiR5 = 14.0 ± 1.7 and hkiR6 = 17.1 ± 1.9, whereas the average

degree for the whole network is hki = 2.67 ± 0.09. Still, links R5-R5 between provincial hubs,

unlike R6-R6 links, are not under-represented. In general, the different connection patterns of

R5 and R6 (or R1 and R2) proteins enables us to hypothesize that they play distinct biological

6

roles, with R6 proteins likely being much more important 31.

A closer look at the air transportation network also helps to show that important structural

properties may be left unexplained by focusing on degree alone, as well as to stress the impor-

tance of the relative within-module degree as opposed to the degree. Johannesburg, in South

Africa, has degree k =84, which is 23% smaller than the degree of Cincinnati in the U.S.,

k =109. Still, one can ﬂy from most capitals in the world to Johannesburg but not to Cincin-

nati. There are two main reasons for this. First, while Johannesburg is the most connected city in

its region (sub-Saharan Africa), Cincinnati (North America) is not; this effect is captured by the

within-module relative degree, which is 9.3 for Johannesburg and 4.3 for Cincinnati. Second,

Johannesburg has many connections to other regions, whereas Cincinnati does not; this effect

is captured by the participation coefﬁcient, which is 0.52 for Johannesburg and 0.05 for Cincin-

nati. As a result, Johannesburg is a global hub (R6) in our classiﬁcation, whereas Cincinnati is a

provincial hub (R5). One can thus understand why R6-R6 connections are over-represented in

air transportation networks (most global hubs are connected to one another), whereas R5-R5 are

not (most provincial hubs are poorly connected to provincial hubs in other regions). In general,

our approach shows why the behavior of R5 and R6 nodes is so different in air transportation

networks, which cannot be understood from the degree of the nodes alone.

Conclusion

We have shown that global properties that do not take into account the modular organization of

the network may sometimes fail to capture potentially important structural features; although all

networks (except, maybe, the protein interactomes) show no degree-degree correlations when

compared to the appropriate ensemble of random networks, they all have clearly distinctive

properties in terms of how nodes with certain roles are connected to each other. Our results thus

call attention to the need to develop new approaches that will enable us to better understand the

structure and evolution of real-world complex networks.

Additionally, our ﬁndings demonstrate that networks with the same functional needs and

growth mechanisms have similar patterns of connections between nodes with different roles.

7

Attempts to divide complex networks into “classes” or “families” have been made before, for

example in terms of the degree distribution 8 and in terms of the relative abundance of certain

subgraphs or motifs 29,30. Our work here complements those attempts, and is the ﬁrst one to

build on the crucial fact that most real-world networks display a markedly modular structure.

Although we cannot put forward a theory for the division of the networks into two classes,

we hypothesize that it might be related to the fact that networks in the stringy-periphery class

are transportation networks, in which strict conservation laws must be fulﬁlled. Indeed, for

transportation systems it has been shown that, under quite general conditions, a hub oligarchy

is the the most efﬁcient organization 32. Conversely, both protein interactomes and the Internet

can be seen as signaling networks, which do not obey conservation laws.

where NM is the number of non-empty modules (smaller than or equal to the number N of

nodes in the network), L is the number of links in the network, ls is the number of links between

nodes in module s, and ds is the sum of the degrees of the nodes in module s. The objective

of a module identiﬁcation algorithm is to ﬁnd the partition P ∗ that yields the largest modularity

M ≡ M(P ∗). Note that NM is only constrained to be NM ≤ N, but is otherwise selected by the

optimization algorithm so that M is maximum. The problem of identifying the optimal partition

is analogous to ﬁnding the ground state of a disordered system with Hamiltonian H = −LM. 25

Since the modularity landscape is in general very rugged, we use simulated annealing to

ﬁnd a close to optimal partition of the network into modules 11,12,25. This method is the most

accurate to date 11,14.

Role deﬁnition

deﬁned as

We determine the role of each node according to two properties 11,12: the relative within-module

degree z and the participation coefﬁcient P . The within-module degree z-score measures how

“well-connected” node i is to other nodes in the module compared to those other nodes, and is

zi =

where κi

s is the number of links of node i to nodes in module s, si is the module to which node

i belongs, and the averages h. . .ij∈s are taken over all nodes in module s.

The participation coefﬁcient quantiﬁes to what extent a node connects to different modules

(1)

We deﬁne the participation coefﬁcient Pi of node i as

Pi = 1 −

NM

Xs=1  

(3)

where κi

s is the number of links of node i to nodes in module s, and ki =

s κi

s is the total

degree of node i. The participation coefﬁcient of a node is therefore close to one if its links are

P

uniformly distributed among all the modules and zero if all its links are within its own module.

We classify as non-hubs those nodes that have low within-module degree (z < 2.5). De-

pending on the amount of connections they have to other modules, non-hubs are further subdi-

vided into 11,12: (R1) ultra-peripheral nodes, that is, nodes with all their links within their own

module (P ≤ 0.05); (R2) peripheral nodes, that is, nodes with most links within their module

(0.05 < P ≤ 0.62); (R3) satellite connectors, that is, nodes with a high fraction of their links

to other modules (0.62 < P ≤ 0.80); and (R4) kinless nodes, that is, nodes with links homo-

geneously distributed among all modules (P > 0.80). We classify as hubs those nodes that

have high within-module degree (z ≥ 2.5). Similar to non-hubs, hubs are divided according to

their participation coefﬁcient into: (R5) provincial hubs, that is, hubs with the vast majority of

links within their module (P ≤ 0.30); (R6) connector hubs, that is, hubs with many links to

most of the other modules (0.30 < P ≤ 0.75); and (R7) global hubs, that is, hubs with links

homogeneously distributed among all modules (P > 0.75).

Network randomization and statistical ensembles

We use two different ensembles of random networks 19,28. In the ﬁrst ensemble, which we denote

by D, we only preserve the degree sequence of the original network; in the second ensemble,

denoted M, we preserve both the degree sequence and the modular structure of the network.

Averages over the ﬁrst and second ensembles are denoted h. . .iD and h. . .iM, respectively.

To generate random networks in ensemble D, we randomize all the links in the network

while preserving the degree of each node. To uniformly sample all possible networks, we

use the Markov-chain Monte Carlo switching algorithm 19,33. In this algorithm, one repeatedly

selects random pairs of links, for example (i, j) and (l, m), and swaps one of the ends of each

link, so that the links become (i, m) and (l, j).

10

To generate random networks in ensemble M, we restrict the Markov-chain Monte Carlo

switching algorithm 28 to pairs of links that connect nodes in the same pair of modules, that is,

we apply the Markov-chain Monte Carlo switching algorithm independently to links whose ends

are in modules 1 and 1, 1 and 2, and so forth for all pairs of modules. This method guarantees

that, with the same partition as the original network, the modularity of the randomized network

is the same as that of the original network (since the number of links between each pair of

modules is unchanged) and that the role of each node is also preserved.

To investigate whether global properties are representative of module-speciﬁc properties, we

focus on degree ki, clustering coefﬁcient Ci, and normalized clustering coefﬁcient Ci/hCiiD.

For each module s in the network, comprising ns nodes, we compute the average of each prop-

erty in the module (for example, hkiii∈s). Additionally, we compute the distribution of such

averages for random modules, which we obtain by randomly selecting groups of ns nodes. If

the empirical module average falls outside of the 95% probability of the distribution for the

random modules, we consider that the global average is not representative of the module aver-

age. We ﬁnally compute the fraction r of modules that are not properly described by the global

average.

To study degree-degree correlations, we consider the average degree ki

nn of the nearest

neighbors of each node i. We deﬁne the normalized nearest neighbors’ degree di as the ra-

tio of ki

nn and: (i) the average value of kj

nn in the network

where N is the number of nodes in the network; (ii) the expected value of ki

nn in the ensemble

of networks with ﬁxed degree sequence

and (iii) the expected value of ki

nn in the ensemble of networks with ﬁxed degree sequence and

modular structure

Note that, in spite of the similar notation, the meaning of di

N is somewhat different from the

other two because the normalization involves an average over nodes, while in di

D and di

M the

normalization involves averages over an ensemble of randomized networks.

To obtain the role-to-role connectivity proﬁles, we calculate the z-score 19,29,28,30 of the num-

ber of links between nodes with roles i and j as

zij =

where rij is the number of links between nodes with roles i and j. To obtain better statistics and

an estimation of the error in the z-score, we carry out this process for several partitions of each

network.

Table 1: Properties and modularity of the studied networks. We show the number of nodes and
links in the network, the modularity M of the best partition obtained using simulated anneal-
ing, and the average modularity hMiD (and standard deviation) of the randomizations of the
network, obtained using the Markov-chain switching algorithm to preserve the degree of each
node (see Methods). Note that all networks are signiﬁcantly modular, that is, their modularity
is larger than the modularity of their corresponding randomizations.

Table 2: Global versus module-speciﬁc average properties. For each network, we show the
fraction r of modules (and standard deviation) whose average degree hkiii, clustering coef-
ﬁcient hCiii, and normalized clustering coefﬁcient hCi/hCiiDii signiﬁcantly differ (at a 95%
conﬁdence) from the global network average (Methods). Fractions r > 0.05 indicate that a
given global property does not correctly describe individual modules. Global degree is not rep-
resentative of individual-module degrees for air transportation networks. Most importantly, the
global clustering coefﬁcient is not representative of individual-module clustering coefﬁcients
for any network (except, maybe, the metabolic network of F. nucleatum).

Figure 1: Modularity and degree distribution explain most degree-degree correlations in com-
plex networks. a-d, Degree dN of the neighbors of a node normalized by the average neighbors’
degree of all the nodes in the network; e-h, Degree dD of the neighbors of a node normalized
by the average neighbors’ degree of the node in the ensemble of random networks with ﬁxed
degree sequence; and i-l, Neighbors’ degree dM of a node normalized by the average neighbors’
degree of the node in the ensemble of random networks with ﬁxed degree sequence and modular
structure (Methods). Values of d are averaged over nodes with similar degree to obtain the func-
tion d(k). Error bars represent the standard error of the average. Note that a lack of deviations
from the ensemble average, that is, d(k) = 1, indicates the absence of correlations. The results
in the middle row show that the degree distribution is responsible for some of the observed
degree-degree correlations, but cannot fully account for them. The degree distribution and the
modular structure of the network do account for most existing degree-degree correlations in the
Internet, metabolic and air transportation networks.

Figure 2: Role-to-role connectivity patterns. We plot the z-score for the abundance (Methods)
of each link type for: a, stringy-periphery networks, and b, multi-star networks (see text). Roles
are labeled as follows: (R1) ultra-peripheral; (R2) peripheral; (R3) satellite connectors; (R4)
kinless nodes; (R5) provincial hubs; (R6) connector hubs; (R7) global hubs. c, We quantify
the similarity between two z-score proﬁles by means of the correlation coefﬁcient (Methods),
with yellow corresponding to large positive correlation, blue to large anti-correlation, and black
to no correlation. Gray columns in a indicate those link types that contribute the most, in
absolute value, to the correlation coefﬁcient. These link types are, therefore, the ones that better
characterize the set of all proﬁles.

Figure 3: Modules and role-to-role connectivity signatures in different network types. Each
panel represents a single module (that is, all the nodes depicted belong to a single module) in:
the metabolic network of A. thaliana, the Asia and Middle East air transportation network, the
protein interactome of C. elegans, and the Internet in 1998. Different symbols indicate different
node roles (see Supplementary Discussion for the names of the nodes). External links to other
modules are not depicted, although it is possible to infer where they are from the role of the
nodes. Shaded regions highlight important structural features.

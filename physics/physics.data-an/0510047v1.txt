We ﬁnd prominent similarities in the features of the time series for the overlap
of two Cantor sets when one set moves with uniform relative velocity over the
other and time series of stock prices. An anticipation method for some of the
crashes have been proposed here, based on these observations.

1 Introduction

Capturing dynamical patterns of stock prices are major challenges both episte-
mologically as well as ﬁnancially [1]. The statistical properties of their (time)
variations or ﬂuctuations [1] are now well studied and characterized (with
established fractal properties), but are not very useful for studying and an-
ticipating their dynamics in the market. Noting that a single fractal gives
essentially a time averaged picture, a minimal two-fractal overlap time series
model was introduced [2, 3, 4].

2 The model

We consider ﬁrst the time series O(t) of the overlap sets of two identical
fractals [4, 5], as one slides over the other with uniform velocity. Let us consider
two regular cantor sets at ﬁnite generation n. As one set slides over the other,
the overlap set changes. The total overlap O(t) at any instant t changes with
time (see Fig. 1(a)). In Fig. 1(b) we show the behavior of the cumulative
t
overlap [4] Qo(t) = R
0 O(˜t)d˜t. This curve, for sets with generation n = 4,
is approximately a straight line [4] with slope (16/5)4. In general, this curve
approaches a strict straight line in the limit a → ∞, asymptotically, where the
overlap set comes from the Cantor sets formed of a − 1 blocks, taking away

the central block, giving dimension of the Cantor sets equal to ln(a − 1)/lna.
The cumulative curve is then almost a straight line and has then a slope
n
(cid:2)(a − 1)2/a(cid:3)
for sets of generation n. If one deﬁnes a ‘crash’ occurring at
time ti when O(ti)−O(ti+1) ≥ ∆ (a preassigned large value) and one redeﬁnes
the zero of the scale at each ti, then the behavior of the cumulative overlap
t
Qo
ti−1 O(˜t)d˜t, ˜t ≤ ti, has got the peak value ‘quantization’ as shown
in Fig. 1(c). The reason is obvious. This justiﬁes the simple thumb rule: one
can simply count the cumulative Qo
i (t) of the overlaps since the last ‘crash’
or ‘shock’ at ti−1 and if the value exceeds the minimum value (qo), one can
safely extrapolate linearly and expect growth upto αqo here and face a ‘crash’
or overlap greater than ∆ (= 150 in Fig. 1). If nothing happens there, one
can again wait upto a time until which the cumulative grows upto α2qo and
feel a ‘crash’ and so on (α = 5 in the set considered in Fig. 1).

We now consider some typical stock price time-series data, available in the
internet [6]. In Fig. 2(a), we show that the daily stock price S(t) variations
for about 10 years (daily closing price of the ‘industrial index’) from January
t
1966 to December 1979 (3505 trading days). The cumulative Qs(t) = R
0 S(t)dt
has again a straight line variation with time t (Fig. 2(b)). We then deﬁne
the major shock by identifying those variations when δS(t) of the prices in
successive days exceeded a preassigned value ∆ (Fig. 2(c)). The variation of
ti
Qs
ti−1 S(˜t)d˜t where ti are the times when δS(ti) ≤ −1 show similar
geometric series like peak values (see Fig. 2(d)).

A simple ‘anticipation strategy’ for some of the crashes may be as follows:
If the cumulative Qs
i (t) since the last crash has grown beyond q0 ≃ 8000
here, wait until it grows (linearly with time) until about 17, 500 (≃ 2.2q0) and
expect a crash there. If nothing happens, then wait until Qs
i (t) grows (again
linearly with time) to a value of the order of 39, 000 (≃ (2.2)2q0) and expect
a crash, and so on.

The features of the time series for the overlap of two Cantor sets when one set
moves with uniform relative velocity over the other looks somewhat similar to
the time series of stock prices. We analyze both and explore the possibilities of
anticipating a large (change in Cantor set) overlap or a large change in stock
price. An anticipation method for some of the crashes has been proposed here,
based on these observations.

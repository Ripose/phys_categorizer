We deﬁne the relevant information in a signal x ∈ X as being the in-
formation that this signal provides about another signal y ∈ Y . Examples
include the information that face images provide about the names of the peo-
ple portrayed, or the information that speech sounds provide about the words
spoken. Understanding the signal x requires more than just predicting y, it
also requires specifying which features of X play a role in the prediction. We
formalize this problem as that of ﬁnding a short code for X that preserves the
maximum information about Y . That is, we squeeze the information that X
provides about Y through a ‘bottleneck’ formed by a limited set of codewords
˜X. This constrained optimization problem can be seen as a generalization of
rate distortion theory in which the distortion measure d(x, ˜x) emerges from
the joint statistics of X and Y . This approach yields an exact set of self
consistent equations for the coding rules X → ˜X and ˜X → Y . Solutions
to these equations can be found by a convergent re–estimation method that
generalizes the Blahut–Arimoto algorithm. Our variational principle pro-
vides a surprisingly rich framework for discussing a variety of problems in
signal processing and learning, as will be described in detail elsewhere.

1 Introduction

A fundamental problem in formalizing our intuitive ideas about information
is to provide a quantitative notion of “meaningful” or “relevant” information.
These issues were intentionally left out of information theory in its original
formulation by Shannon, who focused attention on the problem of transmit-
ting information rather than judging its value to the recipient. Correspond-
ingly, information theory has often been viewed as being strictly a theory
of communication, and this view has become so accepted that many people
consider statistical and information theoretic principles as almost irrelevant
for the question of meaning. In contrast, we argue here that information the-
ory, in particular lossy source compression, provides a natural quantitative
approach to the question of “relevant information.” Speciﬁcally, we formu-
late a variational principle for the extraction or eﬃcient representation of
relevant information. In related work [1] we argue that this single informa-
tion theoretic principle contains as special cases a wide variety of problems,
including prediction, ﬁltering, and learning in its various forms.

The problem of extracting a relevant summary of data, a compressed
description that captures only the relevant or meaningful information, is not
well posed without a suitable deﬁnition of relevance. A typical example is
that of speech compression. One can consider lossless compression, but in
any compression beyond the entropy of speech some components of the signal
cannot be reconstructed. On the other hand, a transcript of the spoken words
has much lower entropy (by orders of magnitude) than the acoustic waveform,
which means that it is possible to compress (much) further without losing
any information about the words and their meaning.

The standard analysis of lossy source compression is “rate distortion the-
ory,” which characterizes the tradeoﬀ between the rate, or signal represen-
tation size, and the average distortion of the reconstructed signal. Rate
distortion theory determines the level of inevitable expected distortion, D,
given the desired information rate, R, in terms of the rate distortion function
R(D). The main problem with rate distortion theory is in the need to specify
the distortion function ﬁrst, which in turn determines the relevant features
of the signal. Those features, however, are often not explicitly known and

2

an arbitrary choice of the distortion function is in fact an arbitrary feature
selection.

In the speech example, we have at best very partial knowledge of what
precise components of the signal are perceived by our (neural) speech recog-
nition system. Those relevant components depend not only on the complex
structure of the auditory nervous system, but also on the sounds and utter-
ances to which we are exposed during our early life. It therefore is virtually
impossible to come up with the “correct” distortion function for acoustic
signals. The same type of diﬃculty exists in many similar problems, such
as natural language processing, bioinformatics (for example, what features of
protein sequences determine their structure) or neural coding (what informa-
tion is encoded by spike trains and how). This is the fundamental problem
of feature selection in pattern recognition. Rate distortion theory does not
provide a full answer to this problem since the choice of the distortion func-
tion, which determines the relevant features, is not part of the theory. It is,
however, a step in the right direction.

A possible solution comes from the fact that in many interesting cases we
have access to an additional variable that determines what is relevant. In the
speech case it might be the transcription of the signal, if we are interested
in the speech recognition problem, or it might be the speaker’s identity if
speaker identiﬁcation is our goal. For natural language processing, it might
be the part of speech labels for words in grammar checking, but the dictionary
senses of ambiguous words in information retrieval. Similarly, for the protein
folding problem we have a joint database of sequences and three dimensional
structures, and for neural coding a simultaneous recording of sensory stimuli
and neural responses deﬁnes implicitly the relevant variables in each domain.
All of these problems have the same formal underlying structure: extract the
information from one variable that is relevant for the prediction of another
one. The choice of additional variable determines the relevant components
or features of the signal in each case.

In this short paper we formalize this intuitive idea using an informa-
tion theoretic approach which extends elements of rate distortion theory.
We derive self consistent equations and an iterative algorithm for ﬁnding
representations of the signal that capture its relevant structure, and prove

3

convergence of this algorithm.

2 Relevant quantization

Let X denote the signal (message) space with a ﬁxed probability measure
p(x), and let ˜X denote its quantized codebook or compressed representation.
For ease of exposition we assume here that both of these sets are ﬁnite, that
is, a continuous space should ﬁrst be quantized.

For each value x ∈ X we seek a possibly stochastic mapping to a repre-
sentative, or codeword in a codebook, ˜x ∈ ˜X, characterized by a conditional
p.d.f. p(˜x|x). The mapping p(˜x|x) induces a soft partitioning of X in which
each block is associated with one of the codebook elements ˜x ∈ ˜X, with
probability given by

p(˜x) = Xx

p(x)p(˜x|x) .

(1)

The average volume of the elements of X that are mapped to the same
codeword is 2H(X| ˜X), where

H(X| ˜X) = − Xx∈X

p(x) X˜x∈ ˜X

p(˜x|x) log p(˜x|x)

(2)

is the conditional entropy of X given ˜X.

What determines the quality of a quantization? The ﬁrst factor is of
course the rate, or the average number of bits per message needed to specify
an element in the codebook without confusion. This number per element of
X is bounded from below by the mutual information

I(X; ˜X) = Xx∈X X˜x∈ ˜X

p(˜x) # ,
p(x, ˜x) log"p(˜x|x)

(3)

since the average cardinality of the partitioning of X is given by the ratio of
the volume of X to that of the mean partition, 2H(X)/2H(X| ˜X) = 2I(X; ˜X), via
the standard asymptotic arguments. Notice that this quantity is diﬀerent
from the entropy of the codebook, H( ˜X), and this entropy normally is not
what we want to minimize.

4

However, information rate alone is not enough to characterize good quan-
tization since the rate can always be reduced by throwing away details of the
original signal x. We need therefore some additional constraints.

2.1 Relevance through distortion:

Rate distortion theory

In rate distortion theory such a constraint is provided through a distortion
function, d : X × ˜X → R+, which is presumed to be small for good represen-
tations. Thus the distortion function speciﬁes implicitly what are the most
relevant aspects of values in X.

The partitioning of X induced by the mapping p(˜x|x) has an expected

distortion

hd(x, ˜x)ip(x,˜x) = Xx∈X X˜x∈ ˜X

p(x, ˜x)d(x, ˜x) .

(4)

There is a monotonic tradeoﬀ between the rate of the quantization and the
expected distortion: the larger the rate, the smaller is the achievable distor-
tion.

The celebrated rate distortion theorem of Shannon and Kolmogorov (see,
for example Ref. [2]) characterizes this tradeoﬀ through the rate distortion
function, R(D), deﬁned as the minimal achievable rate under a given con-
straint on the expected distortion:

R(D) ≡

min

{p(˜x|x):hd(x,˜x)i≤D}

I(X; ˜X) .

(5)

Finding the rate distortion function is a variational problem that can be
solved by introducing a Lagrange multiplier, β, for the constrained expected
distortion. One then needs to minimize the functional

F [p(˜x|x)] = I(X; ˜X) + βhd(x, ˜x)ip(x,˜x)

(6)

over all normalized distributions p(˜x|x). This variational formulation has the
following well known consequences:

5

Theorem 1 The solution of the variational problem,

δF

δp(˜x|x)

= 0,

for normalized distributions p(˜x|x), is given by the exponential form

p(˜x|x) =

p(˜x)

Z(x, β)

exp [−βd(x, ˜x)] ,

(7)

(8)

where Z(x, β) is a normalization (partition) function. Moreover, the La-
grange multiplier β, determined by the value of the expected distortion, D, is
positive and satisﬁes

δR
δD

= −β .

(9)

Proof. Taking the derivative w.r.t. p(˜x|x), for given x and ˜x, one obtains

δF

δp(˜x|x)

= p(x)" log

p(˜x)
1

−

p(˜x) Xx′

p(x′)p(˜x|x′) + βd(x, ˜x) +

λ(x)

p(x)#,

(10)

since the marginal distribution satisﬁes p(˜x) = Px′ p(x′)p(˜x|x′). λ(x) are
the normalization Lagrange multipliers for each x. Setting the derivatives to
zero and writing log Z(x, β) = λ(x)/p(x), we obtain Eq. (8). When varying
the normalized p(˜x|x), the variations δI(X; ˜X) and δhd(x, ˜x)ip(x,˜x) are linked
through

δF = δI(X; ˜X) + βδhd(x, ˜x)ip(x,˜x) = 0,

(11)

from which Eq. (9) follows. The positivity of β is then a consequence of
the concavity of the rate distortion function (see, for example, Chapter 13 of
Ref. [2]).

6

2.2 The Blahut–Arimoto algorithm

An important practical consequence of the above variational formulation is
that it provides a converging iterative algorithm for self consistent determi-
nation of the distributions p(˜x|x) and p(˜x).

Equations (8) and (1) must be satisﬁed simultaneously for consistent
probability assignment. A natural approach to solve these equations is to
alternately iterate between them until reaching convergence. The following
lemma, due to Csisz´ar and Tusn´ady [3], assures global convergence in this
case.

Lemma 2 Let p(x, y) = p(x)p(y|x) be a given joint distribution. Then the
distribution q(y) that minimizes the relative entropy or Kullback–Leibler di-
vergence, DKL[p(x, y)|p(x)q(y)], is the marginal distribution

Namely,

p(y) = Xx

p(x)p(y|x).

I(X; Y ) = DKL[p(x, y)|p(x)p(y)] = min
q(y)

DKL[p(x, y)|p(x)q(y)] .

Equivalently, the distribution q(y) which minimizes the expected relative en-
tropy,

p(x)DKL[p(y|x)|q(y)],

Xx

is also the marginal distribution p(y) = Px p(x)p(y|x).

The proof follows directly from the non–negativity of the relative entropy.

This lemma guarantees the marginal condition Eq. (1) through the same

variational principle that leads to Eq. (8):

Theorem 3 Equations (1) and (8) are satisﬁed simultaneously at the mini-
mum of the functional,

F = −hlog Z(x, β)ip(x) = I(X; ˜X) + βhd(x, ˜x)ip(x,˜x) ,

(12)

where the minimization is done independently over the convex sets of the
normalized distributions, {p(˜x)} and {p(˜x|x)},

min
p(˜x)

min
p(˜x|x)

F [p(˜x); p(˜x|x)] .

7

These independent conditions correspond precisely to alternating iterations
of Eq. (1) and Eq. (8). Denoting by t the iteration step,

( pt+1(˜x) = Px p(x)pt(˜x|x)

pt(˜x|x) = pt(˜x)

Zt(x,β) exp(−βd(x, ˜x))

(13)

where the normalization function Zt(x, β) is evaluated for every t in Eq.
(13). Furthermore, these iterations converge to a unique minimum of F in
the convex sets of the two distributions.

For the proof, see references [2, 4]. This alternating iteration is the well
known Blauht-Arimoto (BA) algorithm for calculation of the rate distortion
function.

It is important to notice that the BA algorithm deals only with the op-
timal partitioning of the set X given the set of representatives ˜X, and not
with an optimal choice of the representation ˜X. In practice, for ﬁnite data,
it is also important to ﬁnd the optimal representatives which minimize the
expected distortion, given the partitioning. This joint optimization is similar
to the EM procedure in statistical estimation and does not in general have a
unique solution.

3 Relevance through another variable:

The Information Bottleneck

Since the “right” distortion measure is rarely available, the problem of rel-
evant quantization has to be addressed directly, by preserving the relevant
information about another variable. The relevance variable, denoted here by
Y , must not be independent from the original signal X, namely they have
positive mutual information I(X; Y ). It is assumed here that we have access
to the joint distribution p(x, y), which is part of the setup of the problem,
similarly to p(x) in the rate distortion case.1

1The problem of actually obtaining a good enough sample of this distribution is an
interesting issue in learning theory, but is beyond the scope of this paper. For a start on
this problem see Ref. [1].

8

3.1 A new variational principle

As before, we would like our relevant quantization ˜X to compress X as much
as possible. In contrast to the rate distortion problem, however, we now want
this quantization to capture as much of the information about Y as possible.
The amount of information about Y in ˜X is given by

I( ˜X; Y ) = Xy X˜x

p(y, ˜x) log

p(y, ˜x)
p(y)p(˜x)

≤ I(X; Y ).

(14)

Obviously lossy compression cannot convey more information than the orig-
inal data. As with rate and distortion, there is a tradeoﬀ between compress-
ing the representation and preserving meaningful information, and there is
no single right solution for the tradeoﬀ. The assignment we are looking for is
the one that keeps a ﬁxed amount of meaningful information about the rel-
evant signal Y while minimizing the number of bits from the original signal
X (maximizing the compression). 2 In eﬀect we pass the information that X
provides about Y through a “bottleneck” formed by the compact summaries
in ˜X.

We can ﬁnd the optimal assignment by minimizing the functional

L[p(˜x|x)] = I( ˜X; X) − βI( ˜X; Y ),

(15)

where β is the Lagrange multiplier attached to the constrained meaningful
information, while maintaining the normalization of the mapping p(˜x|x) for
every x. At β = 0 our quantization is the most sketchy possible—everything
is assigned to a single point—while as β → ∞ we are pushed toward arbitrar-
ily detailed quantization. By varying the (only) parameter β one can explore
the tradeoﬀ between the preserved meaningful information and compression
at various resolutions. As we show elsewhere [1, 5], for interesting special
cases (where there exist suﬃcient statistics) it is possible to preserve almost
all the meaningful information at ﬁnite β with a signiﬁcant compression of
the original data.

2It is completely equivalent to maximize the meaningful information for a ﬁxed com-

pression of the original variable.

9

3.2 Self-consistent equations

Unlike the case of rate distortion theory, here the constraint on the meaning-
ful information is nonlinear in the desired mapping p(˜x|x) and this is a much
harder variational problem. Perhaps surprisingly, this general problem of
extracting the meaningful information—minimizing the functional L[p(˜x|x)]
in Eq. (15)—can be given an exact formal solution.

Theorem 4 The optimal assignment, that minimizes Eq. (15), satisﬁes the
equation

p(˜x|x) =

p(˜x)

Z(x, β)

exp"−βXy

p(y|x) log

p(y|x)

p(y|˜x)# ,

(16)

where the distribution p(y|˜x) in the exponent is given via Bayes’ rule and the
Markov chain condition ˜X ← X ← Y , as,

p(y|˜x) =

1

p(˜x) Xx

p(y|x)p(˜x|x)p(x).

(17)

This solution has a number of interesting features, but we must emphasize
that it is a formal solution since p(y|˜x) in the exponential is deﬁned implicitly
in terms of the assignment mapping p(˜x|x). Just as before, the marginal
distribution p(˜x) must satisfy the marginal condition Eq. (1) for consistency.

Proof. First we note that the conditional distribution of y on ˜x

p(y|˜x) = Xx∈X

p(y|x)p(x|˜x) ,

(18)

follows from the Markov chain condition Y ← X ← ˜X.3 The only varia-
tional variables in this scheme are the conditional distributions, p(˜x|x), since
other unknown distributions are determined from it through Bayes’ rule and
consistency. Thus we have

p(˜x) = Xx

p(˜x|x)p(x) ,

(19)

3It is important to notice that this not a modeling assumption and the quantization ˜X
is not used as a hidden variable in a model of the data. In the latter, the Markov condition
would have been diﬀerent: Y ← ˜X ← X.

10

and

p(˜x|y) = Xx

p(˜x|x)p(x|y) .

The above equations imply the following derivatives w.r.t. p(˜x|x),

δp(˜x)
δp(˜x|x)

= p(x)

and

δp(˜x|y)
δp(˜x|x)

= p(x|y) .

(20)

(21)

(22)

Introducing Lagrange multipliers, β for the information constraint and λ(x)
for the normalization of the conditional distributions p(˜x|x) at each x, the
Lagrangian, Eq. (15), becomes

L = I(X, ˜X) − βI( ˜X, Y ) −Xx,˜x
p(˜x|x)p(x) log"p(˜x|x)

= Xx,˜x

(23)

(24)

Taking derivatives with respect to p(˜x|x) for given x and ˜x, one obtains

Comments:

1. The Kullback–Leibler divergence, DKL[p(y|x)|p(y|˜x)], emerged as the
relevant “eﬀective distortion measure” from our variational principle
but is not assumed otherwise anywhere! It is therefore natural to con-
sider it as the “correct” distortion d(x, ˜x) = DKL[p(y|x)|p(y|˜x)] for
quantization in the information bottleneck setting.

2. Equation (28), together with equations (18) and (19), determine self
consistently the desired conditional distributions p(˜x|x) and p(˜x). The
crucial quantization is here performed through the conditional distri-
butions p(y|˜x), and the self consistent equations include also the opti-
mization over the representatives, in contrast to rate distortion theory,
where the selection of representatives is a separate problem.

12

3.3 The information bottleneck iterative algorithm

As for the BA algorithm, the self consistent equations (16) and (17) suggest
a natural method for ﬁnding the unknown distributions, at every value of β.
Indeed, these equations can be turned into converging, alternating iterations
among the three convex distribution sets, {p(˜x|x)}, {p(˜x)}, and {p(y|˜x)}, as
stated in the following theorem.

Theorem 5 The self consistent equations (18), (19), and (28), are satisﬁed
simultaneously at the minima of the functional,

F [p(˜x|x); p(˜x); p(y|˜x)] = −hlog Z(x, β)ip(x)

(29)
= I(X; ˜X) + βhDKL[p(y|x)|p(y|˜x)]ip(x,˜x) ,(30)

where the minimization is done independently over the convex sets of the
normalized distributions, {p(˜x)} and {p(˜x|x)} and {p(y|˜x)}. Namely,

min
p(y|˜x)

min
p(˜x)

min
p(˜x|x)

F [p(˜x|x); p(˜x); p(y|˜x)] .

This minimization is performed by the converging alternating iterations. De-
noting by t the iteration step,

(31)




pt(˜x|x) = pt(˜x)

Zt(x,β) exp(−βd(x, ˜x))

pt+1(˜x) = Px p(x)pt(˜x|x)
pt+1(y|˜x) = Py p(y|x)pt(x|˜x)

and the normalization (partition function) Zt(β, ˜x) is evaluated for every t
in Eq. (31).

Proof. For lack of space we can only outline the proof. First we show that
the equations indeed are satisﬁed at the minima of the functional F (known
for physicists as the “free energy”). This follows from lemma (2) when applied
to I(X; ˜X) with the convex sets of p(˜x) and p(˜x|x), as for the BA algorithm.
Then the second part of the lemma is applied to hDKL[p(y|x)|p(y|˜x)]ip(x,˜x)
which is an expected relative entropy. Equation (28) minimizes the expected
to variations in the convex set of the normalized
relative entropy w.r.t.

13

{p(y|˜x)}. Denoting by d(x, ˜x) = DKL[p(y|x)|p(y|˜x)] and by λ(˜x) the normal-
ization Lagrange multipliers, we obtain

δd(x, ˜x) = δ −Xy
= Xy  −

p(y|x) log p(y|˜x) + λ(˜x)(Xy

p(y|x)
p(y|˜x)

+ λ(˜x)! δp(y|˜x) .

The expected relative entropy becomes,

Xx Xy  −

p(y|x)p(x|˜x)

p(y|˜x)

+ λ(˜x)! δp(y|˜x) = 0 ,

p(y|˜x) − 1)!

(32)

(33)

(34)

which gives Eq. (28), since δp(y|˜x) are independent for each ˜x. Equation
(28) also have the interpretation of a weighted average of the data conditional
distributions that contribute to the representative ˜x.

To prove the convergence of the iterations it is enough to verify that
each of the iteration steps minimizes the same functional, independently,
and that this functional is bounded from below as a sum of two non–negative
terms. The only point to notice is that when p(y|˜x) is ﬁxed we are back to
the rate distortion case with ﬁxed distortion matrix d(x, ˜x). The argument
in [3] for the BA algorithm applies here as well. On the other hand we
have just shown that the third equation minimizes the expected relative
entropy without aﬀecting the mutual information I(X; ˜X). This proves the
convergence of the alternating iterations. However, the situation here is
similar to the EM algorithm and the functional F [p(˜x|x); p(˜x); p(y|˜x)] is
convex in each of the distribution independently but not in the product space
of these distributions. Thus our convergence proof does not imply uniqueness
of the solution.

3.4 The structure of the solutions

The formal solution of the self consistent equations, described above, still
requires a speciﬁcation of the structure and cardinality of ˜X, as in rate
distortion theory. For every value of the Lagrange multiplier β there are
corresponding values of the mutual information IX ≡ I(X, ˜X), and IY ≡

14

I( ˜X, Y ) for every choice of the cardinality of ˜X. The variational principle
implies that

δI( ˜X, Y )
δI(X, ˜X)

= β−1 > 0 ,

(35)

which suggests a deterministic annealing approach. By increasing the value
of β one can move along convex curves in the “information plane” (IX, IY ).
These curves, analogous to the rate distortion curves, exists for every choice
of the cardinality of ˜X. The solutions of the self consistent equations thus
correspond to a family of such annealing curves, all starting from the (trivial)
point (0, 0) in the information plane with inﬁnite slope and parameterized by
β. Interestingly, every two curves in this family separate (bifurcate) at some
ﬁnite (critical) β through a second order phase transition. These transitions
form a hierarchy of relevant quantizations for diﬀerent cardinalities of ˜X, as
described in [1, 5, 6].

Further work

The most fascinating aspect of the information bottleneck principle is that it
provides a uniﬁed framework for diﬀerent information processing problems,
including prediction, ﬁltering and learning [1]. There are already several
successful applications of this method to various “real” problems, such as
semantic clustering of English words [6], document classiﬁcation [5], neural
coding, and spectral analysis.

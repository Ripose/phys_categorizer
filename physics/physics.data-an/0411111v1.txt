In this report I present a possible scenario which can lead to the emergence

of a generalised Gamma distribution ﬁrst presented by C Tsallis et al. as the

distribution of traded volumes of stocks in ﬁnancial markets. This propose is

related with superstatics and the notion of moving average commonly used in

econometrics.

I. THE Γ-DISTRIBUTION

The Γ-distribution is a general distribution that is veriﬁed in processes where the waiting

times between variables that follow a Poisson distribution are signiﬁcant. It involves two

free parameters, usually labeled by α and θ and deﬁned as [1],

pα,θ (x) =

xα−1 exp

x
θ

(cid:0)−
Γ [α] θα

.

(cid:1)

A special case of Γ-distribution is to consider α = r/2 and θ = 2. In this case the distribution

is called χ2-distribution and represents the probability of get a value ζ of a variable that

is obtained by the summation of r independent squared variables ξi associated with the

Gaussian distribution with null mean and unitary variance [1],

The same form presented in Eq.

(1) can be obtained as the stationary solution of the

following diﬀerential stochastic equation

II. INTRODUCING THE GENERALISED Γ-DISTRIBUTION

Let one now suppose that parameter θ in Eq. (3) is in fact a stochastic variable on time

scale larger than the characteristic time scale γ−1. This means that pα,β (x) is, for this case,

a conditional probability density function pα (x

β). If the random process for β is associatd

with a SPDF, Π (β), then the SPDF for x variable, P (x), is simply given by

P (x) =

pα (x

β) Π (β) dβ.

Among the various distributions for non-negative variables let one consider that β is

associated, itself, with a Γ-distribution,

P (x) =

pα (x

which can be associated to a microscopic equation similar to Eq. (6).

Calculating the integral presented in equation (8) one gets,

P (x) =

Γ [α + λ] ωα
Γ [α] Γ [λ]

xα−1 (1 + ω x)

−(α+λ) .

Deﬁning ¯θ = 1

ω (α+λ) and q = 1 + 1

which I will call the qΓ-distribution. This kind of distribution was already veriﬁed, at least,

for the distribution of traded volumes of stocks in ﬁnancial markets [3]. For the limit

This problem of ﬂuctuations in some intensive parameter of the dynamical equation(s)

that describe(s) the evolution of a system [4] was recently studied by C. Beck in the context of

Langevin equation with ﬂuctuating temperature [5] and extended together with Eddie G.D.

Cohen [6] who deﬁned it as superstatistics (a statistic of statistics). This superstatistics

presents a close relation to the non-extensive statistical mechanics framework based on the

entropic form [7,8],

For the problem of the distribution of traded volume of stocks in ﬁnancial markets the

presence of ﬂuctuations in θ, or the mean value of the scaled variable α x, it is similar to

the problem of the moving average in the analysis of the volatility useful in the reprodution

of some empirical facts like the autocorrelation function and the so-called leverage efect, see

e.g. Ref. [9].

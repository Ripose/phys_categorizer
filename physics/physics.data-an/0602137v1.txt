Recently, it has been determined that many real-world networks show community structure. In
this Letter, we propose a growth model to create a scale-free network with a tunable strength (noted
by Q) of community structure and investigate the inﬂuence of the community structure upon the
SIRS epidemiological process. We focus on the global and local synchronization of the system which
is characterized by the order parameter σ. The numerical results have showed that, a transition
occurs as Q suns from 1 to 0 for the global synchronization, and the local synchronization behaves
very diﬀerently. The results may be related to the patterns observed in real epidemics. In addition,
we study the impact of mean degree hki upon the synchronization on scale-free networks and ﬁnd
that hki plays an important role.

I. Introduction.—The study of networked systems, in-
cluding technological, social and biological networks of
various kinds, has attracted considerable attention in
physics community [1, 2, 3, 4]. How the structural prop-
erties of networks, such as the lengths of shortest paths
between vertices, degree distribution, clustering coeﬃ-
cient, degree correlation etc., aﬀect dynamical processes
taking place upon the networks[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], has
been one of the most important subjects of the body of
work. Recently, it has been found that many real-world
networks show community structure[11, 12], i.e., groups
of vertices that have a high density of edges within them,
relatively with a lower density of edges between groups.
However, there’s few work about the inﬂuences of com-
munity structure upon dynamics.

In this Letter, we intend to ﬁll this gap by investi-
gating SIRS epidemiological model on the scale-free net-
works with various strength (noted by Q) of commu-
nity structure.
In Ref.[13], the authors have studied
SIRS on WS small-world model and found that when
p, which characterizes the degree of disorder of the net-
work, reaches an medium value pc, synchronization of the
system emerges. Comparatively, we focus on the global
and local (inside each community) dynamics, discovering
that no synchronization comes forth when the network’s
community structure is strong enough, i.e. the commu-
nities are relatively segregative and there are few edges
between them. Moreover, the vertices inside each com-
munity appear weaker synchronization when Q is in the
range of intermediately large values.

II. Network Model.—We propose a growth model
to create a network with a tunable parameter denot-

two ingredients of BA model, growth and preferential
attachment[14], the algorithm of our model is as fol-
lows: Starting with c communities U1, U2, ..., Uc−1, Uc,

and each community with a small number (m0) of core
vertices, at every time step we add into each community a
new vertex with m(< m0) edges that link the new vertex
to n diﬀerent vertices within this community and m − n
diﬀerent vertices within other c − 1 communities already
present in the system. The initial m0 × c vertices link
to each other to hold the connectivity of the network.
The values of m and n are not necessary to be integers
(take m for example: the fractional part of m denotes
the probability to link m′ + 1 diﬀerent vertices, where
m′ is the integral part of m). When add a new vertex
into community Ul, ﬁrstly choose n diﬀerent vertices in
this community according to “preferential attachment”,
which means the probability Q that the new vertex will
be connected to vertex i (i ∈ Ul) depends on the de-
kj . For each
gree ki of vertex i, i.e. Q(ki) = ki/ Pj∈Ul
one of the other m − n edges of the new vertex, choose a
community Uh(6= Ul) randomly and connect the new ver-
tex to the vertices in Uh following the same mechanism
described above.

The scaling behavior of the degree distribution of
the networks with community structure can be calcu-
lated using Continuum theory introduced by Barab´asi,
Albert and Jeong[15], Master-equation approach of
Dorogovtsev, Mendes, and Samukhin[16] or Rate-
equation approach introduced by Krapivsky, Redner, and
Leyvraz[17]. In our model, the degree distributions p(k)
of vertices of the global network, as well as the local net-
works (inside each community), are power-law with ex-
ponent 3.0, i.e., p(k) ∝ k−3.0 (see Fig.1). The analytic
procedure is omitted here.

As proposed by Newman and Girvan[18], the strength

of community structure can be quantiﬁed by

of the network with N = 105, c = 10, m = 4.0 and n =
3.0, that says Q = 0.65. It is showed that the both degree
distributions are power-law with the exponent γ = 3.0.
It
means the global network as well as each community are scale-
free and in accord with real-world networks. It’s worthwhile
to point out that, for diﬀerent value of Q, the distributions
do not change.

Thus, we ﬁx m and c and adjust the value of n to get net-
works with various strength Q of community structure.
Obviously, when n/m = 1/c, the model is equivalent to
the well-known BA model with Q = 0[14].

III. Epidemic Model.—We analyze SIRS epidemic
model intending to reveal the role of community struc-
ture playing on the temporal dynamics of the epidemic
spreading. The disease consists of three stages: suscepti-
ble (S), infected (I), and refractory (R). A vertex of the
networked population is described by a single dynamical
variable adopting one of these three values. Susceptible
elements can pass to the infected state through contagion
by an infected element. Infected elements pass to the re-
fractory state after an infection time TI . Refractory
elements return to the susceptible state after a recovery
time TR. The contagion is possible only during the S
phase, and only infected by I elements. During the R
phase, the elements are immune and do not infect oth-
ers. Evolution of the system proceeds by discrete steps.
Each vertex in the network is characterized by a time
counter τi(t) = 0, 1, ..., TI + TR ≡ T , describing its phase
in the cycle of the disease. The epidemiological state πi
of the vertex (S, I, or R) depends on the phase in the

FIG. 2: The time series of the fraction of infected vertices.
The systems have N = 104, c = 25 and m = 4.0, and the
infection cycle with TI = 8 and TR = 5. The left three ﬁgures
(a1), (b1) and (c1) showed the global ﬂuctuations of ninf(t) on
the network with Q = 0.46, 0.81 and 0.935 respectively. The
right three ﬁgures showed the local ﬂuctuations correspond-
ingly. It’s obvious that the global and local ﬂuctuations are
very diﬀerent. The detailed analysis is presented in the text.

following way:

πi(t) = S
πi(t) = I
πi(t) = R if τi(t) ∈ [TI +1, T ]

if τi(t) = 0
if τi(t) ∈ [1, TI]

(3)

The state of a vertex at the next step depends on both
its current phase in the cycle and the state of its neigh-
bors in the network. A susceptible vertex stays such as,
at τ = 0, until it becomes infected. Once infected, it goes
(deterministically) over a cycle that lasts T time steps.
During the ﬁrst TI time steps, the infected vertex can po-
tentially transmit the disease to a susceptible neighbor.
During the last TR time steps of the cycle, it remains in
state R, immune and not contagious. After the cycle is
complete, it returns to the susceptible state. As men-
tioned in Ref.[13], if vertex i is susceptible and it has ki
neighbors, among which kinf are the number of infected
ones, i will become infected with probability kinf/ki.

IV. Results and Discussions.—Speciﬁcally we study
the behavior of the infected sites with respect to Q, which
determines the strength of community structure in the
networks. A typical realization starts with the genera-
tion of the network with Q and the initialization of the
states of the vertices. The initial fraction of infected ver-
tices is ninf(0) = 0.1 with the rest susceptible, which was
used in all the simulations.

After transient time a stationary state is achieved, we
see the pronounced ﬂuctuations in the fraction of in-
fected vertices as a function of time. Figure 2 shows the
time series of fraction of infected vertices in the network
for diﬀerent community strength Q. The three networks

FIG. 3: The two top ﬁgures show the clear global (Fig. a1)
and local (Fig. a2) periodic oscillations on the network with
weak community structure (Q = 0.46). The time steps have
been scaled by the natural period T of the infection cycle.
T0 is the period of the oscillations. It is manifest that T0 >
T , which is diﬀerent from the result T0 = T presented in
Ref.[21]. The two bottom ﬁgures show the order parameter
vs the strength of community structure Q. Fig. b1 show the
global one and Fig. b2 show the local one. We could ﬁnd that,
varying Q from 1.0 to 0.5, the global synchronization curve
has a transition at Q ≈ 0.85, and the local synchronization
curve fall down at Q ≈ 0.8 and then rises until it’s almost
ﬂat.

have N = 104, m = 4.0, c = 25, and infection cycle with
TI = 8 and TR = 5. The initial state is random with
ninf(0) = 0.1. At n = 2.0 thus Q = 0.46 (see Fig.2(a1)),
the network has a weak strength of community structure.
It is similar to the real-world networks whose the com-
munity strength Q often fall into the range from about
0.3 to 0.7[18]. In such situation, the fraction of infected
vertices has large amplitude oscillations, which probably
related to the observed patterns in real epidemics[19, 20].
For strong community structure, such as Q = 0.81, 0.935
(see Fig.2(b1) and (c1) respectively), the time series are
turbid and have no regular periods. In addition, we study
the local dynamics, that is epidemic process inside each
community. Figure 2(a2), (b2) and (c2) show the time
evolution of the fraction of infected vertices in a commu-
nity, for Q = 0.46, 0.81 and 0.935 respectively. The oscil-
lation variety is not clear in the ﬁgures, thus we should
present a more detailed statistic quantity for character-
izing these phenomena.

To quantitatively describe the local dynamics, we
study the synchronization parameter, which is the rel-
evant order parameter here, deﬁned as

FIG. 4: The impact of mean degree hki upon the synchroniza-
tion on scale-free networks with Q = 0. We show the order
parameter σ vs hki for diﬀerent period T of the infection cy-
cle, such as 8 ((cid:3)), 10 (◦) and 12 (△), as hki. A transition can
be seen as hki increases.

where φj = 2π(τj − 1)/T is a geometrical phase corre-
sponding to τj. The states τ = 0 have been left out of
the sum in (4). When the system is not synchronized, the
phases widely spread in the cycle and the complex num-
bers eiφ are correspondingly spread in the unit circle. In
this situation σ is small. Besides, when a signiﬁcant part
of the vertices is synchronized in the cycle, σ is large.
The synchronization would strictly be σ = 1 if nearly all
vertices were at the same state at the same time. For
the local synchronization, we calculate the above order
parameter over the vertices inside each community.

Figure 3(b1) and Figure 3(b2) demonstrate the global
and local synchronization characterized by parameter σ
as a function of Q, respectively. The results are obtained
with the average taken over 104 time steps and subse-
quently over 20 diﬀerent network structures. We ﬁgure
out that there exists a transition of global synchroniza-
tion occurring at the value Qc ≈ 0.85. The above simula-
tions are also preformed for larger network size and it is
found no qualitative distinction but sharper transition.
Furthermore, surprisingly, in contrast with the global
synchronization, there exists a minimum value of local
synchronization parameter σ corresponding to Q ≈ 0.8,
as shown in Figure 3(b2). This result implies that when
the edge density between communities is quite low (for
very large Q), the local dynamics mainly depends on the
inner structure of communities. While in the case of high
edge density among communities (small Q), the local
dynamics is almost the same as the global one, which
is attributed to the strong coupling among them. For
medium value of Q, the local synchronization appears
weak. Figure 3(a1) and Figure 3(a2) show two proto-

typical examples of scaled time series of local and global
infected vertex fraction for Q = 0.46, respectively. One
can ﬁnd that the period T0 of the oscillations is obviously
longer than the natural period T of the infection cycle,
which is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the result presented
in Ref. [21].

Furthermore, we have studied the impact of the mean
degree hki of scale-free networks upon the synchroniza-
tion. We start the simulation on scale-free networks
which are generated by using the BA model or our model
with n/m = 1/c. The initial fraction of infected vertices
is assumed to be ninf(0) = 0.1. The parameter m, the
number of edges of the new vertex, is set to be a real
number, as referred in section II. In ﬁgure 4 we show the
order parameter σ vs mean degree hki for diﬀerent pe-
riod T of the infection cycle. The ratio TI /TR is ﬁxed
to 1 and the other parameters N = 104, m = 4.0. As
shown in Figure 4, for a ﬁxed period T , the transition
from weak synchronization to strong one occurs at some
critical value of hki, and the larger the period T , the
lower the critical value of hki.

V. Conclusion.—To summarize, we have proposed a
growth model to create a scale-free network with a tun-
able strength Q of community structure and investigated
the inﬂuence of the community structure upon the dy-
namics of the SIRS epidemiological model. We focused
on the global and local synchronization of the system
which is characterized by the order parameter σ. Nu-
merical results show that a transition from strong global
synchronization to weak one occurs at a critical value
approximately Q ≈ 0.85. Diﬀerent from the global syn-
chronization, there exists a minimal value of order pa-
rameter σ for the local synchronization. For very large
Q, the inner structure of each community plays the main
role in the local synchronization, while for quite low Q
value, the local as well as the global synchronization is as-
cribed to the strong coupling among communities. Since
the strength of community structure in many real-world
networks falls into the range approximately from 0.3 to
0.7[18], we perform the simulations in accord with the
empirical observations. Simulation results show that the
dynamical behavior of the system appears spontaneous
state of wide amplitude oscillations, which is in consistent
with the oscillation patterns observed in real epidemics
[19, 20]. Perhaps the observed community structure of
social networks plays an important role in the dynamics
of the disease spread.

In addition, we should point out that the mean degree
hki also does main contribution to the synchronization
upon scale-free networks. We have studied the synchro-
nization order parameter σ vs hki on scale-free networks
with Q = 0. The simulation results demonstrate that,

4

for a ﬁxed period T , a transition in the synchronization
can be observed as hki increases. The larger period T
corresponds to smaller critical value of transition point
hkic.

Abstract—A generalization of the maximum noise fraction
(MNF) transform is proposed. Powers of each band are
included as new bands before the MNF transform is per-
formed. The generalized MNF (GMNF) is shown to per-
form better than the MNF on a time dependent airborne
electromagnetic (AEM) data ﬁltering problem. 1

Keywords— Maximum noise fraction transform, noise

ﬁltering, time dependent airborne electromagnetic data.

I. Introduction

THE maximum noise fraction (MNF) transform was in-
troduced by Green et al. [1]. It is similar to the principle
component transform [2] in that it consists of a linear trans-
form of the original data. However, the MNF transform
orders the bands in terms of noise fraction.

One application of the MNF transform is noise ﬁltering
of multivariate data [1]. The data is MNF transformed, the
high noise fraction bands are ﬁltered and then the reverse
transform is performed.

We show an example where the MNF noise removal adds
artiﬁcial features due to the nonlinear relationship between
the diﬀerent variables of the data. A polynomial generaliza-
tion of the MNF is introduced which removes this problem.
In Section II we summarize the MNF procedure. The
problem data set is introduced in Section III and the MNF
is applied to it. In Section IV, the generalized MNF trans-
form is explained and applied. The conclusions are given in
Section V.

II. The Maximum Noise Fraction (MNF) Transform

In this section we deﬁne the MNF transform and list some
of its properties. For further details the reader is referred
to Green et al.
[1] and Switzer and Green [3]. A good re-
view is also given by Nielsen [4]. A reformulation of the
MNF transform as the noise-adjusted principle component
(NAPC) transform was given by Lee et al. [5]. An eﬃcient
method of computing the MNF transform is given by Roger
[6].

Let

Zi(x),

i = 1, . . . , p

be a multivariate data set with p bands and with x giving
the position of the sample. The means of Zi(x) are assumed
to be zero. The data can always be made to approximately
satisfy this assumption by subtracting the sample means.
An additive noise model is assumed:

Z(x) = S(x) + N (x)

where Z T (x) = {Z1(x), . . . , Zp(x)} is the corrupted signal and
S(x) and N (x) are the uncorrelated signal and noise compo-
nents of Z(x). The covariance matrices are related by:

Cov{Z(x)} = Σ = ΣS + ΣN

where ΣN and ΣS are the noise and signal covariance matri-
ces.

The noise fraction of the ith band is deﬁned as

Var{Ni(x)}/Var{Zi(x)}.

The maximum noise fraction transform (MNF) results in a
new p band uncorrelated data set which is a linear transform
of the original data:

Y (x) = AT Z(x).

The linear transform coeﬃcients, A, are found by solving
the eigenvalue equation:

AΣN Σ−1 = ΛA

(1)

where Λ is a diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues, λi. The
noise fraction in Yi(x) is given by λi. By convention the λi
are ordered so that λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ . . . ≥ λp. Thus the MNF trans-
formed data will be arranged in bands of decreasing noise
fraction. The proportion of the noise variance described by
the ﬁrst r MNF bands is given by

Pr
Pp

i=1 λi
i=1 λi

.

The eigenvectors are normed so that AT ΣA is equal to an
identity matrix.

The advantages of the MNF transform over the PC trans-
form are that it is invariant to linear transforms on the data
and the MNF transformed bands are ordered by noise frac-
tion.

The high noise fraction bands can be ﬁltered and then the
transform reversed. This can lead to an improvement in the
ﬁltering results because the high noise fraction bands should
contain less signal that might be distorted by the ﬁltering.
Examples of this approach have been given by Green et al.
[1], Nielsen and Larsen [7] and Lee et al. [5].

An extreme version of MNF ﬁltering is based on excluding
the eﬀects of the ﬁrst r components. That is r is chosen so
as to include only bands with high enough noise ratios. This
can be achieved by:

Z ∗(x) = (A−1)T RAT Z(x)

(2)

where Z ∗(x) is the ﬁltered data and R is an identity matrix
with the ﬁrst r diagonal elements set to zero. Thus elimi-
nating the eﬀect of one or more of the MNF bands produces
a ﬁltered data set which is a linear transform of the original
data. This MNF based ﬁlter uses interband correlation to
remove noise.

In order to use Equation (1) to compute A, ΣN has to
be known. Nielsen and Larsen [7] have given four diﬀerent
ways of estimating N (x). They all rely on the data being
spatially correlated. A simple method for computing N (x)
is by

N (x) = Z(x) − Z(x + δ)

(3)

where δ is an appropriately determined step length. We are
eﬀectively assuming

From Equation (2), each band of the generalized MNF

(GMNF) ﬁltered data can be seen to be,

2

Z ∗

i (x) =

p

q

X

X

j=1

k=1

Fi,j+(k−1)pZ k

j (x)

where Fi,j+(k−1)p is the element in row i and column j+(k−1)p
of the ﬁlter matrix:

F = (A−1)T RAT

Thus the GMNF transform leads to a polynomial ﬁlter.

To apply the GMNF ﬁlter to the data in Fig. 1, the
GMNF transform was applied with powers of up to order 6
for each band appended to the original data. Cross terms
were found to make little diﬀerence to the result and so were
not included. The ﬁrst 15 of the 42 GMNF components,
contributing approximately 80% of the noise fraction, were
eliminated.

Fig. 2(c) shows the GMNF ﬁltered AEM data. A com-
parison with the MNF ﬁltered data (Fig. 2(b)) shows that
for GMNF ﬁltered data , the noise reduction is greater and
spurious features are much less evident.

V. Conclusion

We have proposed a generalized maximum noise fraction
transform (GMNF) that is a polynomial as opposed to linear
transform. The GMNF was applied to ﬁltering a test AEM
data set. It was found to remove more noise while adding
less artiﬁcial features than the MNF based ﬁlter.

Implementing the GMNF is a simple extension of the
MNF implementation. Software written for the MNF trans-
form can be be used for the GMNF transform without any
modiﬁcation.

S(x) = S(x + δ).

To the extent that this is not true, the estimate of N (x) is
in error.

When this method of noise estimation is used, the MNF
transform is equivalent to the min / max autocorrelation
factor transform [3].

III. Airborne Electromagnetic Data

We test the MNF ﬁltering methodology on a ﬂight line
produced by SPECTREM’s time dependent airborne elec-
tromagnetic (AEM) system. Background information on
this AEM system has been explained by Leggatt [8]. A
multiband image can be formed by consecutive ﬂight lines
but usually each ﬂight line is examined separately.

Fig. 1 shows a ﬂight line of data, consisting of the seven
windowed AEM X band spectra. All seven bands are dis-
played stacked above each other. The amplitude of a band
at a particular point is proportional to the vertical distance
of the spectrum from its corresponding zero amplitude ref-
erence (dotted) line. Neighbouring points along a line are
responses from neighbouring points on the ground. The
higher band numbers are associated with greater under-
ground depths.

Ore bodies are often associated with small features in the
higher bands. Analysis can be made easier by ﬁltering the
spectra. Because this data set has substantial interband
correlation, the MNF ﬁltering methodology can be used.

Fig. 2 (b) shows the MNF ﬁltering of the spectra in Fig.
1. Only the last three bands (i.e. 5, 6 and 7) and a portion
of the ﬂight line are shown. The noise was estimated by
taking the diﬀerence in neighboring pixels, as in Equation
(3). The data were ﬁltered by excluding the ﬁrst two MNF
bands which accounted for approximately 86% of the noise
fraction. Although the noise has been reduced, spurious
features have been added, indicated by ‘S’. Excluding only
the last MNF component does not signiﬁcantly reduce the
magnitude of the spurious features and does almost no noise
reduction.

As seen in Equation (2), the MNF ﬁltered data is com-
posed from a linear function of the original data. Fig. 3
shows a plot of Z1(x) against RZ1 (x), where RZ1 (x) is the
diﬀerence between Z1(x) and a least squares regression of
Z1(x) based on all the other bands. The clear pattern of the
residuals plotted in Fig. 3 is evidence that the relationship
between Z1(x) and the other bands is not linear. Similar
patterned residuals were found for residual plots based on
the other bands. In the next section we show how the linear
assumption can be relaxed.

IV. The Generalized Maximum Noise Fraction Transform

From the discussion in the previous section it appears
that using a linear ﬁlter is too restrictive for this data set.
Gnanadesikan [9] proposed a generalization of the principle
component transform. Powers of the original bands were
appended to the data set as new bands. For example, p new
bands can be created by appending the square of each band
to the original data set. Thus each generalized principle
component would be a polynomial, as opposed to linear,
function of all the bands in the original data set.

The same procedure can be applied to generalize the MNF
transform. More formally, a new data set, Z ′(x), can be
created by appending up to q powers of the original data
set:

Z ′(x) = {Z1(x), Z2(x), . . . , Zp(x), Z 2

p (x), . . . ,

1 (x), Z 2

2 (x), . . . , Z 2

Z1(x)q, . . . , Z q

p (x)}.

We are assuming that the Zi(x) have zero means. Cross
terms, such as Z1(x)Z2(x) can also be appended. The rest of
the methodology remains unchanged.

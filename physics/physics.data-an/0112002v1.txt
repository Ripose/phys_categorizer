Abstract

By using similarity transformations approach, the exact propagator
for a generalized one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation, with linear
is obtained.
drift force and space-time dependent diﬀusion coeﬃcient,
The method is simple and enables us to recover and generalize special
cases studied through the Lie algebraic approach and the Green function
technique.

The Fokker-Planck (FP) equation is a very useful tool in modelling a large
number of stochastic phenomena in non equilibrium statistical physics as well
as in chemistry, biology and many other disciplines of science [1, 2, 3]. The
general one dimensional FP equation is given by

−

P (x, t) =

µ1 (x, t) P (x, t) +

∂2
∂x2 µ2 (x, t) P (x, t) .

(1)

In this work we are interested in studying the case where µ1 (x, t) and µ2 (x, t)
are linear functions of x with time dependent coeﬃcients; namely

µ1 (x, t) = C(t)x + D(t), and µ2 (x, t) = B(t) + E(t)x.

(2)

Here we assume that the coeﬃcients B(t), C(t), E(t) are arbitrary real functions
of time and D(t) satisﬁes some constraint that will be stated later so as to get
exact analytic solutions to the problem. Furthermore, since µ2 (x, t) must be
positive semi-deﬁnite, the solution has to be limited either to the half axis
x

B(t)
E(t) for E(t) > 0 or to the half axis x

B(t)
E(t) for E(t) < 0.

By these restrictions (2), the FP equation can be written

Note that Eq. (3) includes two special cases: the FP equation with a linear drift
force for E(t)
0 which was solved in the framework of Lie algebraic approach
[4] and by the Green function technique [5], and the generalized FP equation
with linear drift force for B(t)

0 and D(t) = 3
If the coeﬃcients B, C, D, and E are constant, the solution of Eq.(3) may be
given by the standard method using Laplace of Fourier transforms of P (x, t) with
respect to x. This leads to a new function, say
P (k, t), that obeys a ﬁrst order
partial diﬀerential equation and can be solved by the method of characteristics.
If these coeﬃcients are time dependent function, the solution of Eq. (3) may

be written in the form of an ordered integral on time as

P (x, t) = U (x, t)P (x, 0) ,

H(x, t′) for t

with T being the time-ordering operator. To get over this diﬃculty, the familiar
approaches use the Lie algebra [4, 6] or the theorem of Suzuki [7].

(cid:27)

In this paper, we propose to give the solution of this equation via the
similarity transformations approach [8, 9] which consists in performing a series
of transformations on Eq.
(3) in order to write the evolution operator as a
product of non time-ordering operators whose their action on P (x, 0) is known.
Performing the transformation P (x, t) = X(x, t) Q (x, t) , where X(x, t) is

an arbitrary invertible operator, one gets the new equivalent equation

However, the usual method for solving equations of type (22) with the con-

technique that leads to the result using simple arguments.

This is the general solution of Eq. (22) satisfying the conditions (23). To
obtain the physical solution we have to distinguish between the two boundary
conditions at x = 0 : R(0, t) = 0 for all t and R(0, t)

For the ﬁrst case, it implies that the transition probability density from any
point y
= 0, 0) = 0. This means that
the boundary x = 0 acts as a reﬂecting barrier. This is satisﬁed by choosing
b. Furthermore, from Eq. (28) it is obvious that G(x, t; y, 0) must satisfy

For the second case, there is non zero probability for a transition from y
x = 0. The boundary x = 0 acts then as an absorbing barrier. Again from the
initial condition G(x, t; y, 0) = θ(εy)δ(x
y) one gets a = 1. From the formal
solution (24) it is obvious that if R(x, 0) is a non zero constant in the domain of
its deﬁnition, then R(x, t) does not evolve, i.e. R(x, t) = R(x, 0) for all t > 0. To
satisfy this condition, it is obvious from (28) that G(x, t; y, 0) must satisfy the

Thus we have derived the propagator and its corresponding characteristic
function for a generalized FP equation with time dependent coeﬃcients satisfy-
ing the relation (20) such that many special cases can be easily deduced from
it. For instance, if we set B(t)
0, the propagator obtained in ref.[6] is gener-
alized for arbitrary sign of E(t) and the solution is given for the two boundary
conditions corresponding to a reﬂecting barrier and an absorbing barrier.

Abstract

A new method for measuring the quantities inﬂuenced by bin-to-bin and inside
bin correlations is presented. This method is essential for large multiplicity and/or
high density of particles in phase space. The method was applied to the two particle
correlation functions of e+e− →W+W− events.

1 Introduction

The usual calculations of statistical errors for entries in histograms and the use of these
errors in the ﬁtting procedure can bias the measurements if there are several entries from
the same event. Traditionally, in the past this problem was ignored. The eﬀect is small for
low multiplicity events. However, for LEP and especially for the future LHC, RHIC, etc...
experiments this eﬀect is not small at all. These entries are correlated creating bin-to-bin
and inside bin correlations. Neglecting these correlations, as we will show below, leads
to a remarkable underestimation of the errors in the measured quantities and less precise
estimation of the quantities themselves.

An eﬀective approach has been proposed in [1]. The exact method decribed here

includes all possible correlation eﬀects.

The method was applied to the two-particle correlation functions of e+e− →W+W−

events.

2 The Method

In this section a new method is presented for construction of the covariance matrix between
the bins of the histogram for an unbiased measurement of the ﬁtted quantities.

The presence of bin-to-bin correlations in two particle distributions is unavoidable. If
there are N positive tracks in the events, each of them has (N − 1) entries in the two-
particle density P , contributing to diﬀerent bins of the histogram. Also, due to the ﬁnite
bin width, the same track can also enter several times in the same bin, which is a source
of inside bin correlations.

The method is based on classical statistics. Let us consider the i-th event from the set
of n events and the two-particle density P which is presented in the histogram hi with
Np bins.

The histogram H = P

n
i=1 hi and values

cjk = X

n

i=1

(hi
j

− Hj/n)(hi

− Hk/n)(1 + 1/n)

were calculated event by event. Here j and k are the bin numbers for the histograms. We
do not know the correlations and errors for one event. But we know that the diﬀerent
events are uncorrelated. Let us consider bin values of the histogram made for one event as
an random vector with unknown distribution. We have an uncorrelated ensemble of these
vectors and hence we can estimate the covariance matrix statistically. It is important to
note, that this algorithm computes both the “technical” and the physical correlations.
For all events we have the resulting histogram H for the two-particle density P and
Vjk = cjk · n/(n − 1) covariance matrix for this histogram. Note, that the expresion
for unbiased estimation of sample covariance was used for the calculation of covariance
between two values[2]. The diagonal terms Vjj of the covariance matrix are assumed to
be the estimate for the squares of the error σj of the j-th of histogram H.

3 The Test of the Method Using the Simulated

Events

The precise measurement of the correlations between particles became important for
e+e− →W+W− events due to possible large impact of these correlations on the mea-
sured W mass [3]. Thus, we applied the method to the correlation functions in fully
hadronic and semileptonic WW events.

The correlation function R is used to study the enhanced probability for emission of

particles. For pairs of particles, it is deﬁned as

R(p1, p2) =

P (p1, p2)
P0(p1, p2)

,

where P (p1, p2) is the two-particle probability density, pi is the four-momentum of particle
i, and P0(p1, p2) is a reference two-particle distribution which, ideally, resembles P (p1, p2)
in all respects, apart from the lack of Bose-Einstein symmetrization. The eﬀect is usually
described in terms of the variable Q, deﬁned by Q2 = −(p1 −p2)2 = M 2(ππ)−4m2
π, where
M is the invariant mass of the two pions. The correlation function can then be written
as

which is frequently parametrised by the function

R(Q) =

P (Q)
P0(Q)

,

R(Q) = 1 + λe

−r2Q2

.

In the above equation, in the hypothesis of a spherically symmetric pion source, the
parameter r gives the RMS radius of the source and λ is the strength of the correlation
between the pions.

The method described in section 2 was tested on the JETSET simulation [4]. We
choose the fully hadronic and semileptonic decay of WW pairs with Bose-Einstein corre-
lations included using the LUBOEI code. The value of λ = 0.85 and r = 0.5 fm was used.
In case of fully hadronic channel the Bose-Einstein correlations were switched on for all
pions(full Bose-Einstein correlations).

The correlation matrices ρjk = Vjk/(σjσk) for like-sign pairs of WW semileptonic
channel (refered as (2q) mode) and for fully hadronic channel (referred as (4q) mode),
computed using 100 000 simulated events for each sample, are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.
The correlations between bins for the WW fully hadronic channel(Fig. 2) are larger than
in the mixed hadronic and leptonic channel(Fig. 1). Thus, the bin-to-bin correlations are
increased with multiplicity, as expected. Notice that the correlations are nearly indepen-
dent of Q, which shows why the eﬀective approach of [1] is a good approximation in this
case.

For the future analysis the 500 samples of 3000 events each for (4q) channel and 500
samples of 1500 events each for (2q) channel were simulated. For each of these samples a
histogram of the correlation function R(Q) was built, using the 25 bins of 100 MeV from
0 to 2.5 GeV. The simulated R distributions were normalized to unity in the region Q >
0.8 GeV/c2. We performed a χ2 ﬁt to the R(Q) to the form (3) for each of 500 samles.

The average values of λ and r from these “naive” ﬁts were:

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)
(5)

λ2q = 0.333 ± 0.029,
r2q = 0.562 ± 0.033 fm

2

for (2q) events and

λ4q = 0.416 ± 0.013,
r4q = 0.561 ± 0.012 fm

for (4q) events. The statistical errors correspond to the average of the errors for 500
samples. The “pull” of the ﬁtted values of λ and r for the simulated (4q) events are shown
in Fig. 3. A Gaussian ﬁts gave that the errors in parameres λ and r are underestimated
by a factor 1.20 ± 0.05 and 1.30 ± 0.05 for the (2q) events and by a factor 1.42 ± 0.06
and 1.53 ± 0.06 for the (4q) events.

The average values of λ and r from the 500 ﬁts using the inverted Vjk matrix (calculated

for each of 500 samples) were:

for (2q) events and

λ2q = 0.332 ± 0.034,
r2q = 0.556 ± 0.040 fm

λ4q = 0.403 ± 0.017,
r4q = 0.565 ± 0.016 fm

(6)

(10)
(11)

for (4q) events. The “pull” of the ﬁtted values of λ and r for the simulated (4q) events
are shown in Fig. 4. A Gaussian ﬁts gave σ(λ−<λ>)/σλ=1.06 ± 0.05 and σ(r−<r>)/σr=1.02
± 0.05 for (2q) channel, and σ(λ−<λ>)/σλ=0.96 ± 0.05 and σ(r−<r>)/σr=1.08 ± 0.05 for
(4q) channel. The above values are in a good agreement with unity and thus the errors
are correctly estimated.

4 Summary

A model independent method for measuring the quantities inﬂuenced by bin-to-bin and
inside bin correlations is described. A package, as an addition to HBOOK, was written to
support this new functionality. The method was tested using the simulated WW events.

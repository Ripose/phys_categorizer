Comment on ”Indispensable Finite Time Correlations for Fokker-Planck Equations

Ragwitz and Kantz [1] propose a correction to a
method for the reconstruction of Fokker-Planck equa-
tions from time series data.
In [2, 3, 4, 5] a method
was presented which directly applied the mathematical
deﬁnitions of the drift D(1) and diﬀusion term D(2) [6]
for an estimate from time series. Here diﬀerent moments
of conditional probability densities (pdf) for ﬁnite step
sizes ∆ in the limit ∆ → 0 have to be estimated. Rag-
witz and Kantz state that previous results have not been
checked and that indispensable ﬁnite time step ∆ correc-
tion have to be employed for reliable estimates of D(2).
We want to add the following comments.

Ragwitz and Kantz base their investigation on an es-
timate of the ﬁnite time conditional probability in terms
of a Gaussian, eq. (7) of their paper. There is, however,
no reason that for ﬁnite ∆ the conditional pdf is Gaus-
sian. The exact expressions for the conditional moments
up to the order ∆2 can be unambigously derived from
the Fokker-Planck equation [7]:

For h(x − x0)2|x0i the ansatz (7) of [1] neglects the last
two terms which are important for processes involving
multiplicative noise. However, intermittency of turbu-
lence is related to a multiplicatice process. This remark
especially applies to the wind data presented in [1]. The
validation of their method based on a Langevin (equation
(9)) only works since purely additive noise is considered.
For the investigation of turbulence Ragwitz and Kantz
claim to obtain remarkable correction, as shown in their
Fig. 6. Our approach in [5] is based on an estimate of the
diﬀusion term using the limit ∆ → 0 yielding a depen-
dency which can be approximated by a low order polyno-
mial. In order to improve on this estimate the coeﬃcients
of this polynomial have been varied in such a way that
the solution of the corresponding Fokker-Plank equation
for ﬁnite values of ∆ yields an accurate representation
of the measured one. In other words, in a second step,
we have performed a parametric estimation of the diﬀu-
sion term. In Figure 1 we present a case where a large
correction to the ∆ → 0 estimation of D(2) had to be
introduced (usually corrections are of the order of some

percentages). For ﬁnite values of ∆ the estimated values
of D(2) clearly diﬀer from the limiting case ∆ → 0. Es-
timations with diﬀerent ”correction” terms for D(2) and
for ﬁnite ∆ values may fake large corrections values. Tak-
ing the limit ∆ → 0 these deviations vanish within the
error.

The range of ∆ which can be taken for the estimate
of D(2) must be choosen carefully in order to ensure that
the Markovian property holds, see [5]. Since for each es-
timated value of D(2) a ﬁnite number of data point is
used, a statistical error can be estimated for D(2) (cf.
Fig. 1). These errors naturally increase considerably for
large values of x (compare Fig. 6 [1] and Fig 13 [5].) To
conclude, a deeper understanding of ﬁnite time correla-
tions are of interest. The correct terms of higher orders
in ∆ [7] may be used to improve on the estimation of
drift and diﬀusion terms. Up to now the best way for
estimating diﬀusion coeﬃcients is to combine a nonpara-
metric estimate for ∆ → 0 with a functional ansatz, i.e.
a suitable polynomial ansatz. Reﬁning the estimates of
the coeﬃcients by parametric methods as for instance de-
scribed by [8] leads to improved results by a comparison
of measured and calculated conditional pdfs at ﬁnite ∆.

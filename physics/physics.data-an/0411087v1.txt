Abstract

Characterisations of the long–term behaviour of heart rate variability in humans

have emerged in the last few years as promising candidates to became clinically sig-

niﬁcant tools. We present two diﬀerent statistical analyses of long time recordings

of the heart rate variation in the Eastern Oyster. The circulatory system of this

marine mollusk has important anatomical and physiological dissimilitudes in com-

parison to that of humans and it is exposed to dramatically diﬀerent environmental

inﬂuences. Our results resemble those previously obtained in humans. This suggests

that in spite of the discrepancies, the mechanisms of long–term cardiac control on

both systems share a common underlying dynamic.

1 Introduction

The change with time in the size of the interval between two consecutive heart-

beats is called heart rate variability (HRV). There are many (not necessarily

independent) sources of HRV in people (1)–(4), but the variations are largely

controlled by the autonomic nervous system through the action of both the

sympathetic and the parasympathetic branches, while the main mechanical

inﬂuences are respiration and blood pressure.

It has been found that long–term HRV shows 1/f noise (5). This behaviour

is found in many dynamical systems and draw attention to long–term HRV.

The detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) was introduced by Peng et al. (6)

to study the long–range correlations found in HRV (7). A cross–over was iden-

tiﬁed around a scale of 10 beats in all healthy subjects, signalling a change of

dynamics when going from short to long time scales. Since then DFA has been

used to characterise HRV in healthy conditions and in the presence of heart

disease (8)–(13). Another promising approach is the analysis of HRV using

wavelets, which is a mathematical technique speciﬁcally suited to analyse non–

stationary series. The wavelet transform extracts the cumulative amplitudes

of ﬂuctuations of data at each point in time for a given scale (14). Ivanov et

al. (15) presented the cumulative variation amplitude analysis (CVAA), where

the inter–beat series were treated with consecutive wavelet and Hilbert trans-

forms and an instantaneous amplitude is assigned to each inter–beat interval.

It was found that the same Gamma distribution describes the distributions of

instantaneous amplitudes at all scales and for all the healthy subjects in the

study. Further studies using wavelets on long–term recordings have explored

the possibility to deﬁne methods which could be used as markers of heart

disease (16)–(20).

The DFA and CVAA results suggest that there are intrinsic unknown dynam-

ics underlying the long–term behaviour of the healthy human heart. It has

been shown by Hausdorﬀ and Peng (21) that it is extremely unlikely that

the emergence of these complex patterns is due to having a system of many

diﬀerent independent inﬂuences each with their own timescale. The question

of the origin of the universal long–term behaviour of HRV remains open.

In this article we present DFA and CVAA studies of long–term HRV in the

Eastern Oyster in conditions resembling those of their natural habitat (22). In

the ﬁrst section, the circulatory system of the oyster is brieﬂy described. The

basic components of the system designed for the monitoring and acquisition of

the heartbeat data are also presented. In the second section, the mathematical

principles of DFA and CVAA are reviewed and then applied to the analysis

of the oyster’s heartbeat data. In the last section, the conclusions and some

general remarks are given.

2 The system under study

2.1 The Eastern Oyster

The Eastern Oyster is a fairly well studied mollusk (23; 24) which lives in

coastal waters and lagoons from Canada to Mexico. It has an open circula-

3

tory system, i.e., the blood moves not only in the arteries and veins but also

throughout the tissues. There are two accessory hearts which beat a couple

of times per minute, independently from the principal heart. The main heart

has three chambers. The two auricles receive the blood from the gills and send

it, about half a second later, to the ventricle. The automatism of the heart

is of a diﬀuse nature and contractions originate at any point of the ventricle.

Contractions are not induced by impulses from the central nervous system

and it is not known if there are any localised pacemakers. Two types of vesi-

cles are found in the nerve endings of the myocardium, but it is not clear if

they correspond to a rudimentary version of the sympathetic and parasym-

pathetic systems (25). The main external inﬂuences on the heart rhythm are

the temperature, the level of oxygen and the salinity of water, while the main

mechanical inﬂuences are the movement of the shell valves and the gills. When

compared with people there is a factor of hundred in the size of the hearts, the

period of respiration in the Eastern Oyster is two to three times longer and

the heart beats about two times slower. The heartbeat receives perturbations

from the shell valves and from the accessory hearts, which are not present in

the case of the human heart. In summary all the suspected leading causes of

the variability of the heart rate in people are not present or are quite diﬀerent

in the case of the Eastern Oyster.

2.2 The measurements

The experimental set–up was composed of a low–power laser diode, a ﬁbre

optic bundle, a photo–diode and the data acquisition and monitoring sys-

tems (26). We have used a laser diode of 4 mW and 632 nm. The radius of

4

the laser beam was 1 mm. The ﬁbre optic bundle had a length of 1.3 m and

a cross section of 38 mm2 with a transmittance of approximately 60 percent

at this wavelength. The active size of the EG&G Judson J16–5SP–R03M–SC

germanium photo–diode was 3x3 mm2. The voltage signal was recorded with

an AT–MIO 16 data acquisition card connected through a BNC–2080 multiple

channel interface board. The system was controlled with a LabView program

written by us. A sketch of the technique is shown in Fig. 1.

We have studied a set of six oysters with a uniform size of 7 cm and with a

relatively thin section of the shell on top of the heart. Some of the oysters were

measured several times, having as a result a set of 15 time series. There were at

least 12 hours between measurements on the same mollusk. The oysters were

kept in a big water tank under conditions resembling those of their natural

habitat. A short time before the measurements, they were transfered to a small

recipient on the focus of the optical set up. A system of pumps kept the water

circulating and passing through other containers where the water was ﬁltered

and where the salinity, and temperature were controlled.

3 The analyses

The analyses shown below were performed on each of the inter–beat time

series of the oyster’s heartbeat. The laser light was pointed onto the beating

heart. The intensity of the reﬂected light increases as the thickness of the walls

increases in each systole of the ventricle. Hence, the inter–beat of a cardiac

signal measured with our laser technique corresponds to the time between

two consecutive peaks (see Fig. 1b). The monitored signals of the oyster’s

heartbeat are: i) Highly non–stationary, ii) non periodic, and iii) irregular.

5

Further physiological perturbations on the cardiac signals such as gills and

valves movements are clearly identiﬁed in the long–term. This set of special

characteristics of our cardiac signals exclude the application of algorithms

currently used to calculate the inter–beats in ECGs of humans. The most

popular, are based on the QRS complex identiﬁcation (27), which does not

apply to the cardiac signals from the oyster.

To ﬁnd the inter–beat intervals produced by the systole we have used the

following method (see Fig. 2): (i) A set of boxes of the same width D is

used to ﬁnd the maximum in each interval. (ii) A secondary box of width d

centred at the limit of two contiguous boxes is used as a range of conﬁdence

because the inter–beat period is not constant. (iii) The value of D and d are

ﬁxed visually such that the eﬃciency for ﬁnding the peaks is optimal. (iv)

Furthermore, after the calculation of the inter–beat intervals, the outliers are

ﬁltered with a similar procedure as suggested in Ref. (28). We obtained as

a result of applying the algorithm, 15 time series with lengths varying from

10403 to 25802 inter–beats.

3.1 Detrended Fluctuation Analysis

The detrended ﬂuctuation analysis is a technique that permits to identify long–

range correlations in non–stationary time series. As commented in Ref. (29),

DFA has been applied to the study of a broad range of systems, such as the

human gait, DNA sequences, the heartbeat dynamics, the weather, and even

in economics. Specially, in the analysis of natural inter–beat heartbeat ﬂuctu-

ation, DFA has helped to discriminate healthy from heart diseased humans.

It has provided also, a quantitative diﬀerence between old and young people.

6

Several works show the robustness of DFA, although improvements are still

being done (30). DFA is a simple yet powerful tool for studying physiological

data.

The DFA is as follows (6). Let x(i) be a time series. Then (i) integrate x(i),

(ii) divide the time series in n equal amplitude intervals, (iii) in each box

of width n do a polynomial ﬁt of order l (it deﬁnes DFA–l analysis): sl

n(k),

(iv) eliminate the polynomial trend in each box, (v) calculate the root mean

squared ﬂuctuation F as a function of the n intervals, and (vi) do steps (i)–(v)

for several box widths to ﬁnd the functional relation between F (n) and n.

The presence of scaling in the original signal produces a straight line in a

double log plot of F (n) versus n. If the slope, α, is 0.5, the data is uncorrelated

and corresponds to a random walk (31). A slope between 0.5 and 1 signals

the presence of a long–range power law, where α = 1 corresponds to 1/f

noise (32). For a slope bigger than 1, the correlations no longer correspond

to a power law. A value of 1.5 indicates Brownian noise (33). Healthy people

have a slope of 1.5 for values of n less than 10 beats, and a slope of 1 for time

scales between 100 and 10000 beats (6).

Using DFA–1 we found (Fig. 3) that all the oysters in our study present 1/f

noise behaviour for scales above log(n)

2.5, corresponding to

300 beats.

≈

≈

The average slope in this region is α2 = 1.08

0.14 where the error is the

±

standard deviation of all the samples. For shorter time scales, between 10 and

100 beats, a slope α1 = 0.61

0.04 is found. The slope at even shorter scales

±

(log(n) < 1) is also close to 1 in all cases, but the DFA method has poten-

tially large intrinsic systematic eﬀects in this range (29), making it diﬃcult to

extract reliable information. We found the same variation in the results from

7

measurement to measurement when comparing diﬀerent sets from the same

oyster and sets of data from diﬀerent oysters (see Table 1). It is interesting to

note that the respiration and the accessory hearts have independent oscilla-

tions with periods around 20 to 40 beats. In contrast, the shell valves present

intermittent activity but, when active, the period is also in the 20–30 beats

range. These complex perturbations on the oyster’s heartbeat could be the

source of the α1 slope at short time scales (34; 35). To discard the possibility

that polynomial trends could be the source of the cross–over (35) obtained

in this work, we performed analyses of oyster’s heartbeat using DFA–l for

l = 2, 3, 4, and found in each case a cross–over approximately in the same

region indicated by DFA–1, although α2 decreased down to 20% while α1

keeping its same value.

3.2 Cumulative Variation Amplitude Analysis

We also analysed our measurements using CVAA. This technique that is based

on consecutive wavelet and Hilbert transforms was applied for the ﬁrst time

in the study of natural heartbeat ﬂuctuation. It was found that a common

Gamma distribution characterises a group of healthy people. On the other

hand, in the case of a group of people suﬀering sleep apnea, it was found that

such data collapse does not happens. Even more, in some cases it was not

possible to get a Gamma distribution (15). In general, a Gamma distribution

is characteristic of physical systems out of equilibrium. Hence, the results

previously commented suggest that the heartbeat in healthy people owns an

intrinsic underlying dynamics.

Mathematically, CVAA consists of the next steps: (i) Choose adequate scales

8

to analyse the data, (ii) from the original series, a set of /eries each at a

diﬀerent scale is obtained using a continuous wavelet transform. There are

many wavelet families to choose to perform this step and several have been

tried. Each family eliminates local polynomial trends from the signal in a

diﬀerent way. The coeﬃcients c of the wavelet transformation in each scale

reﬂect the cumulative variation of the signal. (iii) Then, each of the new time

series is processed with a Hilbert transform to extract the instantaneous am-

plitudes h of the variations at each point in the series. (iv) Construct the

time series y = c + ih and calculate the amplitudes A = √c2 + h2, (v) ﬁ-

nally, the histogram of these amplitudes is normalised to 1 to form a prob-

ability distribution, P (x), which is then re-scaled such that x

xPmax and

→

P (x)

P (x)/Pmax.

→

Remarkably, we found that each distribution of instantaneous amplitudes is

ﬁtted by a Gamma distribution (15) (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, as in the case

of healthy people, the distributions for all the oysters in the study are well

described by the same Gamma distribution (Fig. 4b), i.e., there is a common

parameter ν (36) which describes the normalised distribution of instantaneous

amplitudes from any oyster. This behaviour is found at scales 23,4,5,6 and for all

the wavelets analysed (37): Daubechies (moments 3–10), Gaussian (moments

3–10), Meyer, Morlet, and B–spline Biorthogonals (decomposition moments 1

and 3). The results obtained for the parameters of the Gamma distributions

were all very similar. As an example of the robustness of our results, in Table 2

are shown the values of the parameters of the ﬁts to the Gamma distributions

performed with orthogonal, biorthogonal, and non–orthogonal wavelets.

The numerical value for the ν parameter in the Eastern Oyster is ν = 1.0

0.2

±

which is slightly lower than the value of ν = 1.4

0.1 found for healthy people

during sleep hours by Ivanov et al. using Gaussian wavelets (15).

4 Conclusions

Using the DFA and CVAA methods we ﬁnd long–range correlations and scaling

in the long–term HRV of the Eastern Oyster. DFA shows 1/f noise behaviour

at large scales and a cross–over to a smaller slope for scales of the order of 300

beats for all oysters in the study. The cross–over happens at a scale well above

the region where DFA presents some bias. The source of the cross–over seems

to be the result of the complex interactions between the components of the

circulatory system of the Eastern Oyster. Models of this phenomena such as

polynomial trends added linearly to a correlated signal do not seem to apply

to the case of the Eastern Oyster.

With CVAA we ﬁnd that all oyster records collapse to a Gamma distribution

with the same numerical value of the ν parameter, ν

1, for a wide variety

≈

of wavelets and scales. These results are remarkably similar to those previ-

ously reported in the study of healthy people, in spite of the fact that the

circulatory system of the Eastern Oyster and the inﬂuences it is exposed to

are dramatically diﬀerent from those in the case of people, pointing thus to

an intrinsic origin of these complex patterns. Characterisations of long–term

HRV are promising candidates for clinical prognostic tools making it vital to

understand its origin in order to exploit fully this type of techniques. Our

results pose stringent constrains and oﬀer new hints and challenges to models

attempting to describe the long–term dynamics of the heart.

reﬂect more light when contracted than during the diastole. (b) The periodic

the stars show the peaks found by our algorithm.

Figure 2. This is a schematic representation of the way our algorithm for

ﬁnding heartbeat peaks works. The cardiac signal is divided with a set of

boxes of equal length D. Due to the fact the heartbeat period is not constant,

a secondary set of boxes of width d < D are localised at the limit of two

contiguous boxes. In the plot D = 1.25 and d = 0.5 are common values which

optimises the search of peaks. See text for more details.

Abstract

Siver A.S., Ezhela V.V. On the CODATA Recommended Values of the Fundamental Physical Constants:
V3.2(1998) & V4.0(2002): IHEP Preprint 2003–34. – Protvino, 2003. – p. 18, tables 12.

With the help of special program package PAREVAL designed in Mathematica system we reproduce
values of basic fundamental physical constants obtained by NIST and recommended by CODATA for in-
ternational usage since 1998. In our adjustment we use the input data and methods published by NIST in
1998.

It is shown, that the detected earlier inaccuracy of published by NIST correlations (that made the NIST

1998&2002 results doubtful) are, most probably, due to inadmissible independent rounding.

The simple estimate of the critical numbers of decimal digits in the independently rounded correlation
coeﬃcients is obtained. Further independent rounding of “critically rounded” correlations can lead to the
non positive semi deﬁnite correlation matrices and hence is inadmissable.

It is demonstrated by a few examples that the poor presentation of the correlated random quantities in
the scientiﬁc literature is a common bad practice and is argued (once again) that the common standard for
presentation numerical values of correlated quantities in publications and sites is urgently and badly needed.

1 Motivation

Fundamental physical constants (FPC) are the basic entities in pure and applied natural sciences
and in technology. Thanks to eﬀorts of many national metrology institutions, NIST1 systematists,
and international coordination by CODATA2 we seem to have a more or less reliable procedures to
monitor the development of the uniﬁed system of constants, their periodically adjusted numerical
values, uncertainties, and correlations.

We use “seem” because in spite of many national and international documents on the rules and
standards on the statistical and experimental data presentations in the oﬃcial publications3 there
is a sharp contradiction between rules/standards and reality of scientiﬁc data exchanges in the past
and modern scientiﬁc communication media.

An example of such contradictions is the lack of attention from producers (NIST) and over-
seers (CODATA) of the evaluated FPC data to the quality of the ﬁnal data presentations in the
oﬃcial publications on the paper and even in electronic forms: data presented are incomplete and
inaccurate as we will show further.

The other example of the mentioned contradiction is the ignorance of correlations in all re-
spectable information resources: handbooks, textbooks, monographs, reviews, and scientiﬁc soft-
ware packages that have reprinted samples of the recommended FPC-1998 (see, for example, [5] –
[11]).

Since the release of FPC-1998 the scientiﬁc community obtained real access to the correlations
of the FPC uncertainties and one can see that correlations between uncertainties of some universal
constants are too “strong” to be ignored in high accuracy calculations. But unfortunately the
correlation matrix presented on the NIST/CODATA site and reproduced partly in the publication
[1] (see, Table XXV on the page 453) is non positive semi-deﬁnite in contradiction with deﬁnition
of the correlation matrix. Looking at the NIST correlation coeﬃcients one can see that they are
rounded oﬀ too “tightly.” Format of the numbers shows that they were rounded uniformly and
independently (e.g.
ignoring the crucial constraints that any covariance and correlation matrix
must respect).

1National Institute of Standards and Technology(USA) [2].
2Committee on Data for Science and Technology [3].
3We failed, however, to ﬁnd any oﬃcial documents standardising the procedures of rounding average values,

standard uncertainties, and their correlations of the jointly measured or evaluated (adjusted) quantities.

From the textbooks on numerical calculations it is known that the rounding of the correlated
values is a subject of special treatment (see for example [12], page 499). The average values,
standard uncertainties, and correlation coeﬃcients could not be rounded oﬀ independently.

Independent rounding may lead to catastrophic changes in the connection of averages, standard
uncertainties, and scatter ellipsoid: average values may get out of scatter ellipsoid, scatter ellipsoid
may turn to hyperboloid after independent rounding oﬀ the correlation coeﬃcients.

With the lack of discussions of the rounding correlated quantities in the NIST/CODATA pub-
lications, we interpret this as the result of independent rounding that destroy catastrophically
the system of adjusted values. An example of such catastrophe with FPC-1998 recommended for
“public usage” is the negative variance for the Rydberg constant calculated from the equation
R∞ = α2mec/2h [13]. If this confusion did not caused by a misprint in signs of some correlation
coeﬃcient it is most probably the “inconsistency induced by rounding oﬀ” the adjusted FPC-1998.
If we are right in our account that corruption of the true data was due to independent rounding
then we should clarify the inﬂuence of independent rounding of the average values and dispersions.
To test this a reproduction of the whole adjustments procedure used by NIST experts is needed.

The main goal of this work is to reproduce the NIST results using their data and methods as
they presented in the detailed publication [1] and on the NIST site and then to work out the proper
way of correlated data presentation and exchange.

The other goal of our work is to draw attention (once again) of the physics community to the
problem with standardization of the statistical (experimental) data presentation in the modern
scientiﬁc communication media.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section we present a few variants
of our adjustment in comparison with corresponding NIST/CODATA results. The last section
summarizes outputs from our exercises and our vision how to improve the situation.

2 On the NIST FPC Adjustments Technology

In our analyses we tried to be as close as possible to the NIST adjustments strategy. Fortunately
more or less complete overview of the NIST:1998 adjustment procedure including detailed pre-
sentation of the experimental data, theoretical models and formulae, the FPC evaluation strategy
description, and explanation of the speciﬁc aspects of the calculations were published in [1]. To test
the traceability of the NIST results through their public information resources we have attempted
to reproduce NIST FPC values on the basis of data, formulae and instructions from publication [1]
and NIST site only.

There are 107 principal input data expressed as functions of 57 adjusted constants (variables)
via the set of observational equations. These 57 variables are subdivided in two classes: constants
(see Table 2) and corrections (see Table 3)

Numerical values in the Tables 2, 3 are presented in the standard concise form X(Y ) × 10Z u
(where X — average value, Y — standard uncertainty of X referred to the last digits of the quoted
value, u — unit) and are expressed in SI. The symbols of adjusted constants are as follows: R∞
(Rydberg constant); α (ﬁne structure constant); h (Plank constant); me/mµ (electron-muon mass
ratio); Ar(X) ( mass of the particle X in atomic units), where X denotes symbol of the particle,
such as electron or alpha-particle; µX/µY (X, Y magnetic moment ratio); R — molar gas constant;
xu(X Kα1) — x-ray unit of the X atom; d220(X) — {220} lattice spacing of the diﬀerent (X) silicon
mono-crystal (d220); Rp and Rd are the bound-state proton and deuteron rms charge radii.

There are also 28 adjusted variables (see Table 3) that are not fundamental at all, but were
introduced in order to decrease the theoretical uncertainty of the several observational equations.

They are:

(N=D);

δN(n, L, 2 · j) — additive correction to nLj energy level of the hydrogen (N=H) and deuterium

δe, δµ — additive correction to electron and muon magnetic moment anomaly,
δM u — additive correction to hyperﬁne splitting of the muonium basic bound state.

Unfortunately the set of ﬁnal values released so far by NIST/CODATA:1998 does not contain
estimates for large part of the 57 adjusted variables (marked as “not given” in the Tables 2, 3
in cases when we failed to ﬁnd corresponding output value on the site CODATA Fundamental
Physical Constants. Version 3.2 Release date: 1 October 2003. [4]). Hence our comparison will be
incomplete to this extent.

The other problem that makes the straightforward reproduction of the NIST estimates impos-
sible is the corrupted presentation of the input correlation sub-matrix (see [1], page 434, Table
XIV.A.2) of the data related to the Rydberg constant. It is non positive deﬁnite. We interpret this
confusion as the result of unjustiﬁed independent rounding of correlation coeﬃcients (motivated
only to be convenient for publication on the paper). Fortunately the correlation sub-matrix for the
other data presented in [1] (see page 436, Table XIV.B.2 ) is positive deﬁnite.

In spite of the incomplete presentation of the adjustment results and corrupted input correlation
data we decided to clarify to what extent the ignorance of the input correlations in part or totally
will modify the output constants, supposing that average values of the constants are correct as well
as their standard uncertainties.

The strategy of comparisons is as follows. First of all we have convinced that the NIST method
used to obtain values of adjustable variables is indeed the method to ﬁnd stationary points of the
“linearized” χ2. If the input covariance matrix is positive deﬁnite then the obtained solution will be
a minimum and adjustment will be stable if we turn lucky to get into vicinity of a global minimum.
If the input covariance matrix is non positive deﬁnite then the task of ﬁnding stationary points
could be solved for non-degenerate weight matrices but in this case the task has no connection with
least squares method of constants estimation.

Nevertheless it is interesting to compare values of adjusted variables that can be obtained by
NIST method in our PAREVAL package (from the NIST starting point in the adjusted variables
space and with rounded by NIST input covariance matrix [1]) with supposedly true NIST:1998
values.

2.1 Calculations with input correlator published by NIST

Corresponding results are presented in Table 4, where in the ﬁfth column the normalized diﬀerence
of values of third (X3) and fourth (X4) columns is deﬁned as follows

∆ =

X3 − X4
σ2(X3) + σ2(X4)

p

In our adjustment we use close to the NIST starting point (used for ﬁnding zero of the gradient
of χ2 in step-by-step method) in the adjusted variables space and “weights” were constructed from
rounded by NIST input “correlation” matrix [1].

As it can be seen from the ﬁfth column of the Table 4, the shifts in average values are in
general well inside the ranges deﬁned by the quadratically combined “uncertainties”. In all tables,
as a rule, we save in average values and corresponding uncertainties one more digit to show that
some values are not reproduced exactly when rounding independently even if they are well inside
the uncertainties (|∆| < 0.1).

As we have no NIST/CODATA:1998 ﬁnal values of the adjusted corrections we compare our results
with the input values which we use (follow NIST) as observational equation like δ = 0.0 . . . 0(u(δ))
(see Table 5). We see that shifts in average values for all corrections are also well inside the
intervals deﬁned by the input estimates of theoretical systematic uncertainties.

2.2 Calculations with identity input correlation matrix

We learn from Tables 4 and 5 that rounded input correlation matrix leads to slightly shifted values of
the basic constants and corrections that are well inside the uncertainties. To clarify the importance
of correlations further and to test our package we produce adjustment ignoring input correlations.

Table 6: Comparison of the true NIST/CODATA:1998 recommended values (third column) with corre-
sponding values (fourth column) that obtained at IHEP by the NIST method in our PAREVAL package. In
this adjustment we use the same starting point as in previous run and weights were constructed completely
ignoring input correlations. We see (from the ﬁfth column) that shifts in average values are in general inside
the quadratically combined “uncertainties”.

Finally we have checked if the procedure to ﬁnd minimum of the corresponding χ2 without
linearization of the observational equations used gives the same result. We have used the built-in
Mathematica module to ﬁnd minimum starting from the point in the adjusted variables space where
the values of all 29 constants were taken as recommended by NIST/CODATA:1998 and the values
of the rest 28 δ-corrections were taken as 0.001 × u(δtheor).

Corresponding value of χ2/ndf = 0.84, i.e. the same as obtained by using NIST procedure with
linearization. Average values of the constants and corrections obtained by two diﬀerent methods and
diﬀerent programs are practically the same (the maximal normalized diﬀerence is |∆|max ∼ 10−21).
Our results lead us to the conclusion that NIST experts have used input correlation matrix
close to that of presented in their published report. The fact that output correlation matrix is
also non positive semi-deﬁnite does not allow one to exclude possibility that this non positive
semi-deﬁniteness could be induced by the non positive deﬁniteness of the input matrix. This point
remains to be clariﬁed.

Let us compare a sample of our output correlation coeﬃcients with corresponding NIST values.

main diagonal are our values obtained with no input correlations.

As shown in the Table 10 some of our correlation coeﬃcients diﬀer signiﬁcantly from those of

published by NIST.

Now we proceed to the general comments on the practice in the scientiﬁc literature and on the
sites, where the correlated estimates of the random quantities jointly measured or evaluated are
presented.

Often authors of the original papers appear to ignore correlations at all or to present them in an
incomplete manner. So, it is hard to understand what type of uncertainties the quoted correlation
matrix is referred to: statistical, systematic or total. It is dangerous (or even inadmissable) to use
such incomplete data in further analyses and especially in the theory tests. Sometimes this incom-
pleteness is caused by the too ﬁrm editors and publishers requirements. On the other hand there
are also experimental mistakes (see examples of such situation in nuclear physics and technology
[17]).

2.3 On the rounding oﬀ the correlated estimates

As it is well known the covariance matrix for the jointly estimated statistical quantities is by
deﬁnition a positive semi-deﬁnite Hermitian matrix. It has real and nonnegative eigenvalues. The
non degenerate correlation matrix is positive deﬁnite by deﬁnition.

12

Unfortunately some authors publish the “correlation matrix” with no ﬁnal check up this crucial
property of the correlation matrix. In majority cases it happens under the pressure of the limited
publication space. So, authors are forced to present rounded correlation coeﬃcients making this in
an inadmissable manner. The rounding oﬀ the correlation coeﬃcients are produced independently,
saving symmetry of the matrix but ignoring such crucial properties as positive deﬁniteness and
positive semi-deﬁniteness.

To be speciﬁc we quote a few examples from diﬀerent subject ﬁelds. The ﬁrst most striking
example is yet discussed concerning the NIST publications on the adjusted fundamental constants,
including the NIST site. The published version of the input correlation sub-matrix used to construct
the weight matrix in their version of least squares method (LSM) is non positive deﬁnite, (see
[1], page 434, Table XIV.A.2), it has two negative eigenvalues. Also the published version of the
correlation sub-matrix between uncertainties in the recommended values of a sample of fundamental
constants (see [1], page 453, Table XXV) is non positive semi-deﬁnite. We have convinced that it is
because of poor accuracy of the presentation caused by unjustiﬁed uniform independent rounding
of the correlation coeﬃcients. Unfortunately the same way of presentation is used by NIST and
approved by CODATA on their sites.

The other example is the publication of the CLEO collaboration on the high precision mea-
surements of the τ -lepton decay branching ratios [14]. The ﬁnal version of the correlation matrix
presented in the Erratum is as follows:

Table 11: Correlation coeﬃcients between branching fraction measurements of some τ -lepton decays
from [14] .

The corresponding eigenvalues are as follows:

2.173 46,

1.781 87,

1.054 97, −0.007 491 53, −0.002 803 4

This confusion could be due to improper rounding, but we failed to show this by playing with num-
bers (un-rounding). The problem seems to be deeper and hence the CLEO data are questionable.
These should be used with great caution in theory tests and in derivations of “world averaged”
τ -lepton branching ratios.

As we already mentioned, the proper rounding procedure for the jointly measured or estimated
quantities (average vector components, corresponding vector of their standard uncertainties, and
correlation matrix) is the subject of special treatment. So it will be presented elsewhere if we will
not found relevant papers published.

In the next section we construct a simple but important estimate of the threshold accuracy
of the correlation coeﬃcients that should not be violated while uniform independent rounding of
correlation matrix elements.

13

3 On the numerical presentations of correlated quantities in com-

puter readable ﬁles and in publications

Here we derive a simple suﬃcient estimate on the accuracy of a safely independent and uniform
rounding the correlation matrix elements oﬀ.

Let Aij be the n × n correlation matrix. It is real, symmetric, positive deﬁnite, and has matrix

elements bounded as follows

Aii = 1

for all

i = 1, . . . , n and |Ai6=j| < 1.0.

Let Bij be the “rounder” matrix, such that if it is added to the matrix Aij the obtained matrix
Gij = Aij + Bij will be real, symmetric, positive deﬁnite and all |Gi6=j| < 1 are decimal numbers
with k digits after the decimal point.

It is easy to see that matrix Bij should have the following properties:

Bii = 0 for all

i = 1, . . . , n and |Bi6=j| ≤ 5.0 × 10−k−1.

Let further α1 ≤ · · · ≤ αn, β1 ≤ · · · ≤ βn, and γ1 ≤ · · · ≤ γn be the ordered sets of eigenvalues of
the matrices Aij, Bij, and Gij correspondingly. Then from the Weil’s theorem for any l = 1, . . . , n
we have the following inequalities [15],[16]:

αl + β1 ≤ γl ≤ αl + βn.

From the Gershgorin’s theorem on the distributions of the eigenvalues of the Hermitian matrices

[15] it follows that

β1 ≥ −(n − 1) · 5 · 10−(k+1) = −

(n − 1)
2

· 10−k

and hence to have the matrix Gij as positive semi deﬁnite matrix it is suﬃcient to demand

0 ≤ α1 −

(n − 1)
2

· 10−k ≤ γ1.

From the left inequality we have the ﬁnal estimate for the threshold accuracy index for safely
uniform independent rounding (SUIR) of the positive deﬁnite correlation matrix Aij with minimal
eigenvalue αmin

k ≥ K th

SUIR =

n − 1

log10

(cid:18)

(1)

NOTE. According to the Weil’s theorem any uniform rounding the oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements

of the positive semi-deﬁnite covariance matrix is forbidden.

Indeed, as rounder matrix is traceless Hermitian matrix, it obliged to have the negative minimal
eigenvalue. Furthermore from the left inequality of the Weil’s theorem statement it follows that
any rounding could lead to the matrix with negative minimal eigenvalue.

This note shows that the special rounding strategy should be developed4

for such covariance

matrices as well as for the badly conditioned covariance matrices.

4We realise that, most probably, such a strategy was developed already somewhere, but unfortunately is deeply
hidden in the national and international metrology instructions. Some relevant information see, for example, in the
review [17], where the analogous concerns are expressed.

14

In
Now we can make a further comments on the values of the FPC correlation coeﬃcients.
the Table 10, to simplify comparison with NIST data, our output correlation coeﬃcients for basic
FPC are presented with independent rounding to three signiﬁcant digits. In fact we have minimal
eigenvalue for our output 57 × 57 correlation matrix

αmin = 1.290 020 861 518 11 × 10−6

and from the expression (1) for the critical accuracy it follows that at least 8 digits after decimal
point should be saved, when rounding uniformly and independently, to preserve positive deﬁniteness
of the output correlation matrix for basic sample of FPC.

{3.997, 0.00315831, −0.000158432, −2.83681 × 10−16}.

Both matrix are non positive semi-deﬁnite, the 2002 sub-matrix is degenerate as it is seen from the
table above.

Another concern is the accuracy of data presentation on average values and standard uncertain-
ties. As a rule 2002–uncertainties are more than two times larger than corresponding 1998-numbers
(see the table above).

It is to some extent unexpected as the NIST bibliography database on FPC contains 528 addi-
tional to 1998 database entries classiﬁed as “experimental” and “original research” dated between
1999 and 2002 inclusively. Unfortunately the reasons of these enlargements of the standard uncer-
tainties compared to the V3.2(1998)–release did not commented in the V4.0(2002)–release notiﬁ-
cation.

4 Conclusions

In this section we summarize the main results obtained and the discussions presented above.

• The Mathematica package PAREVAL was created and applied for adjustments of FPC. It
reproduces the NIST/CODATA adjustment technology from their data and methods (as of
1998). It is composed of a few modules to maintain: the library of theoretical models, the
experimental data compilation; to perform FPC evaluations, and for results presentation.
The detailed package description as well as the address for access will be presented elsewhere
[18].

• With the help of PAREVAL it is shown, that the “CODATA recommended values of the
fundamental physical constants: 1998” V3.2 and “CODATA recommended values of the fun-
damental physical constants: 2002” V4.0 are questionable in, at least, the values of published
correlation coeﬃcients released in the NIST/CODATA sites. Most probably data were cor-
rupted by unjustiﬁed rounding up the output values.

It is argued that the released so far correlation coeﬃcients are useful only to show the sizes
of correlations but should not be used in the real calculations of high precision observables.
It will be extremely useful if the released for the ﬁrst time ASCII ﬁle be accompanied with
easy computer readable ﬁles with the compact standardized names, units, average values,
standard uncertainties and correlations presented as accurate as possible, without unjustiﬁed
rounding up.

• The simple estimate for the threshold accuracy suﬃcient for safely uniform independent
rounding of the positive deﬁnite correlation matrix is constructed. This estimate can be used
to trigger the data corrupted by unjustiﬁed rounding.

• It is argued that it is an urgent need to create a common standard strategy of rounding
interrelated quantities and common standard data structures to store and exchange the cor-
related data in the computation media. These standards should be freely available for science,
education and technology practitioners.

It seems that it is a real challenge to IT professionals to construct a ﬂexible and tractable
technology to handle large samples of correlated data which will preserve all global properties
and interconnections of the principal components of the stricture in all data transformations
and exchanges.

It was a surprise to learn that in the recommendations in the tables quoting some FPC
values from CODATA the corresponding uncertainties and correlations are absent. Also it
seems that in the high precision sector of nuclear physics, physicists should not ignore cor-
relations of used FPC. So, the warning noting that the uncertainties of some fundamental
constants are highly correlated would be very useful in the APPENDIX H.

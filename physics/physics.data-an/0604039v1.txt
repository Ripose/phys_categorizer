Coupled nonlinear systems under certain conditions exhibit phase synchronization, which may change for
different frequency bands or with presence of additive system noise. In both cases, Fourier ﬁltering is tradition-
ally used to preprocess data. We investigate to what extent the phase synchronization of two coupled R¨ossler
oscillators depends on (1) the broadness of their power spectrum, (2) the width of the band-pass ﬁlter, and (3) the
level of added noise. We ﬁnd that for identical coupling strengths, oscillators with broader power spectra exhibit
weaker synchronization. Further, we ﬁnd that within a broad band width range, band-pass ﬁltering reduces the
effect of noise but can lead to a spurious increase in the degree of synchronization with narrowing band width,
even when the coupling between the two oscillators remains the same.

In recent years both theoretical and experimental studies of
coupled nonlinear oscillators has demonstrated that such os-
cillators can exhibit phase synchronization [1–5]. Analysis
of experimental data has also indicated the presence of phase
synchronization in a range of coupled physical, biological and
physiological systems [6–17]. In many of these studies, an
important practical question is how multi-variate time series
characterized by relatively broad power spectrum are phase
synchronized in a speciﬁc frequency range [18–24]. The pres-
ence of internal or external noise may also be an obstacle
when quantifying phase synchronization from experimental
data [18, 19, 25–27]. In both cases a band-pass ﬁlter is tra-
ditionally applied either to reduce the noise effect or to extract
the frequency range of interest. Thus, it is important to know
to what extent the width of the band-pass ﬁlter inﬂuences the
results of the phase synchronization analysis, as well as what
is the range of the index values obtained from the analysis that
indicate a statistically signiﬁcant phase synchronization.

To address these questions, we consider a system of two

coupled R¨ossler oscillators (1,2) deﬁned as

˙x1,2 = −ω1,2y1,2 − z1,2 + C(x2,1 − x1,2),
˙y1,2 = ω1,2x1,2 + ay1,2,
˙z1,2 = f + z1,2(x1,2 − b)

(1)

with parameter values a = 0.165, f = 0.2, and b = 10.
For the mismatch of natural frequencies, we choose ω1,2 =
ω0 ± ∆ω, with ω0 = 0.6 and ∆ω = 0.005 [Fig. 1(a)]. The
time step in our simulation is ∆t = 2π/103, and the signal
length n = int[t/∆t] with t = 104, where int[x] denotes the
integer part of x.

We ﬁrst investigate the characteristics of the system deﬁned
in Eq. (1) by comparing them with the characteristics of a
second set of two coupled R¨ossler oscillators (3,4) studied in
[3].The system (3,4) is also described by Eq.(1), and has the
same values for parameters a, f , and b as system (1,2). The
only differences are the natural frequency ω0 = 1 and the fre-
quency mismatch ∆ω = 0.015 [Fig. 1(b)]. We observe a sig-
niﬁcantly broader power spectrum for system (1,2) with ω0 =

0.6 and frequency mismatch ∆ω = 0.005 [Fig. 1(c)]. Further,
we observe that the instantaneous phase differences ∆ψ1,1 =
[φx1 (t) − φx2 (t)] mod (2π) for system (1,2) exhibits larger
ﬂuctuations [Fig.1(d)], described by a broader distribution
[Fig.1(e)], compared to system (3,4), suggesting a weaker 1:1
phase synchronization for system (1,2). To quantify the de-
gree of phase synchronization in the two R¨ossler systems we
use the synchronization index ρ = (Smax − S)/Smax [18],
N
where S ≡ − P
k=1 Pk ln Pk is the Shannon entropy [28] of
the distribution P (∆ψ1,1) of ∆ψ1,1, and Smax = ln N , where
N = int[exp(0.626 + 0.4 ln(n − 1.0))] is the optimized num-
ber of bins over which the distribution is obtained [29]. For
system (3,4) with a narrow power spectrum we obtain a sig-
niﬁcantly larger value of ρ compared to the system (1,2) char-
acterized by a broader power spectrum [Fig.1(f)]. Varying the
values of the coupling strength C, we ﬁnd that the phase syn-
chronization index ρ is consistently higher for system (3,4)
characterized by the narrower power spectrum. Thus, for the
same coupling strength C and for identical other parameters,
system (1,2) with ω0 = 0.6, which has a broader power spec-
trum, exhibits weaker synchronization compared to system
(3,4) with ω0 = 1, which has a narrow power spectrum. These
ﬁndings are complementary to a recent study indicating a dif-
ferent degree of phase synchronization for the spectral com-
ponents of coupled chaotic oscillators [30].

Recent work has shown that coupled R¨ossler oscillators
may exhibit different degrees of synchronization for differ-
ent ranges of time scales obtained via wavelet transform [31].
Here, we ask to what extent the width of a band-pass ﬁlter
affects the degree of phase synchronization between two cou-
pled R¨ossler oscillators. While the output observables x1and
x2 of system (1,2) are clearly not in phase [Fig.2(a)], after
Fourier band-pass ﬁltering in the range of ∆f = 0.01 centered
at the peak of the power spectrum 2πf ≈ 0.54 [Fig. 1(c)],
the observables x1 and x2 appear 1:1 synchronized with well
aligned peaks [Fig. 2(b)]. The effect of the band-pass ﬁlter
can be clearly seen in the behavior of the instantaneous phase
difference ∆ψ1:1 [Fig. 2(c)] and in the shape of the probabil-

and ∆ω = 0.005; (b) system (3,4), with x3 corresponding to ω3 = ω0 + ∆ω, where now ω0 = 1 and ∆ω = 0.015. For both R¨ossler
systems C = 0.03. (c) Power spectra of the time sequence x1 (dashed line) and x3 (solid line). A broader spectrum is observed for system

and ∆ψ1,1 ≡ (φx3(t) − φx4(t)) mod (2π) for system (3,4) (solid line), and (e) their corresponding distributions P (∆ψ1,1). System (1,2)
exhibits larger ﬂuctuations in ∆ψ1,1 and is characterized by a broader distribution P (∆ψ1,1). (f) Synchronization index ρ as a function of
the coupling strength C. For identical values of C, system (3,4) (solid line) which is characterized by a narrower power spectrum exhibits
stronger synchronization (larger index ρ) compared to system (1,2) with a broader power spectrum. Speciﬁcally, for identical coupling strength
C = C0 = 0.03, the index ρ = ρ0 (✷) for system (1,2), while ρ = 0.3 > ρ0 (◦) for system (3,4) although the frequency mismatch for system
(3,4) is much larger. The effect of a Fourier band-pass ﬁlter applied to the system (1,2) while keeping C = 0.03 ﬁxed is equivalent to an
increase of the coupling strength of the system leading to a larger index ρ1 > ρ0 (△) as also shown in Fig. 2(e).

ity density function P (∆ψ1,1(t)) [Fig.2(d)]. After band-pass
ﬁltering, ∆ψ1,1 becomes smoother with less ﬂuctuations, and
the distribution P (∆ψ1,1) exhibits a well pronounced peak.
To quantify how the degree of synchronization changes with
the width ∆f of the band-pass ﬁlter, we calculate the synchro-
nization index ρ [Fig.2(e)]. We ﬁnd that for very large values
of the band width ∆f , the index ρ is the same as the value ρ0
obtained for the system (1,2) without any ﬁltering, and that ρ
remains unchanged for intermediate values of ∆f . However,
for decreasing ∆f , the index ρ increases rapidly from the ex-
pected value ρ0 [Fig. 1(f), and 2(c)]. Such deviation to higher
values of ρ > ρ0, while the coupling constant C in Eq. (1)
remains ﬁxed, indicates a spurious effect of synchronization
due to the band-pass ﬁlter. Thus, applying a band-pass ﬁlter
with a too narrow band width when pre-processing empirical
data may lead to overestimation of the phase synchronization
(as deﬁned by index ρ) between two empirical systems where
the coupling strength is not known a-priori.

Many physical and biological systems are inﬂuenced by ex-

ternal noise, which can mask their intrinsic properties. Re-
cent studies have shown that noise can bias the estimation of
driver-response relationship in coupled nonlinear oscillators
leading to change in synchronization measures [32]. Speciﬁ-
cally, external noise may weaken the detection of the coupling
and reduce the synchronization between two coupled dynam-
ical systems. To address this problem, we next test the effect
of external noise on the degree of phase synchronization of
the two coupled R¨ossler oscillators deﬁned in Eq.(1). Adding
uncorrelated and unﬁltered Gaussian noise η to the output ob-
servables x1 and x2, while keeping the coupling constant C
in Eq. (1) ﬁxed, we ﬁnd that the synchronization index ρ de-
creases with increasing noise strength ση, (i.e., higher stan-
dard deviation ση compared to the standard deviation σ of
the output signals x1 and x2) [Fig.3(a)]. The dependence of
ρ on the value of the coupling constant C for different noise
strength is shown in Fig. 3(b). We ﬁnd that the transition to the
state of maximum degree of synchronization (indicated by a
horizontal plateau for ρ in Fig. 3(b)) occurs at decreasing val-

oscillators in Eq.(1) appear not to be synchronized, character-
ized by low values for the index ρ, even for very large values
of the coupling constant C [Fig. 3(b)]. We note, that with in-
creasing noise strength ση the position of the crossover to the
plateau of maximum synchronization shifts to smaller values
of C in Fig.3(b), indicating that with increasing ση the level of
the plateau drops faster compared to the decline in the growth
of ρ with increasing coupling C.

To reduce the effect of noise in data analysis, a common
approach is to apply a band-pass ﬁlter. In the case of the cou-
pled R¨ossler oscillators deﬁned in Eq.(1), we ask to what ex-
tent a band-pass ﬁlter can reduce the effect of external noise
while preserving the expected “true” phase synchronization
as presented by ρ0 in Fig. 1(e). To answer this question, we
ﬁrst need to determine what are the limits to which spurious
phase synchronization can be obtained purely as a result of
band-pass ﬁltering of two uncorrelated and not coupled Gaus-
sian noise signals. Our results for the synchronization index
ρ obtained from multiple realizations of pairs of uncoupled
white noise signals show that the synchronization index ρ
can reach different maximum values ρmax, indicated by ar-
rows in Fig. 4(a), for different band width ∆f — with de-
creasing the band width ρmax increases. The values of ρmax
provide an estimate of the maximum possible effect additive
noise may have on the spurious “detection ” of phase synchro-
nization in coupled oscillators. Thus, empirical observations
of synchronization index ρ > ρmax may indicate presence

characterizes the synchronization between x1 and x2 before ﬁltering.
Narrowing ∆f leads to a sharp increase in ρ, which is an artifact of
the Fourier ﬁltering as the coupling C and all other parameters re-
main unchanged, e.g, for ∆f = 0.005, ρ = ρ1 ≈ 4ρ0.

two coupled oscillators, which is not an artifact of external
noise. Our simulations show that the value of ρmax does not
change signiﬁcantly with the length of the uncorrelated noise
In Fig. 4(b) we show how the synchronization in-

dex ρ for system(1,2) depends on the strength of the added
noise and on the width ∆f of the band-pass ﬁlter. For very
broad band width ∆f the noise is not sufﬁciently ﬁltered, and
the synchronization between the two oscillators decreases (ρ
decreases) with increasing noise strength ση. With decreas-
ing band width ∆f , i.e., applying a stronger ﬁlter, the effect
of the noise is reduced, and correspondingly the index ρ in-
creases — approaching the value ρ0 expected for the system
(1,2) without noise. On the other hand, applying a ﬁlter with
too narrow band width ∆f leads to a spurious synchronization
effects with ρ > ρ0 [Fig.4(b)], following closely the depen-

dence of ρ on ∆f shown in Fig. 2(e) for a R¨ossler system
without noise.

In summary, our results indicate that phase synchronization
between coupled nonlinear oscillators may strongly depend
on the width of the power spectrum of these oscillators. Fur-
ther, we ﬁnd that while external noise can affect the degree of
phase synchronization, band-pass ﬁltering can reduce noise
effects but can also lead to a spurious overestimation of the
actual degree of phase synchronization in the system. This is
of importance when analyzing empirical data in speciﬁc nar-
row frequency ranges, for which the coupling strength may
not be known a-priori.

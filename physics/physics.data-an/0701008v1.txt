Abstract

We propose an approach to explain ﬂuctuations in time intervals of ﬁnancial markets
data from the view point of the Gini index. We show the explicit form of the Gini
index for a Weibull distribution which is a good candidate to describe the ﬁrst
passage time of foreign exchange rate. The analytical expression of the Gini index
gives a very close value with that of empirical data analysis.

1 Introduction

Almost 10 years, ﬁnancial data have attracted a lot of attentions of physicists
as informative materials to investigate the macroscopic behavior of the markets
from the microscopic statistical properties [1,2,3]. Some of these studies are
restricted to the stochastic variables of the price changes (returns) and most
of them is speciﬁed by a key word, that is to say, fat tails of the distributions
[1]. However, the distribution of time intervals also might have important
information about the markets and it is worth while for us to investigate
these properties extensively [4,5,6,7,8].

In our previous studies [9,10,11], we showed that a Weibull distribution is a
good candidate to describe the time intervals of the ﬁrst passage process of
foreign exchange rate. However, from the shape of the Weibull distribution,
intuitively, it is not easy to understand ﬂuctuations in time intervals. To over-
come this point, in this paper, we introduce a Gini index, which is often used
in economics to measure an inequality of income distribution. We here intro-
duce the Gini index as a measure of an inequality of the time interval lengths.
We ﬁrst derive the Lorentz curve and the explicit form of the corresponding
Gini index for a Weibull distribution analytically. We show the analytical ex-
pression of the Gini index is in a good agreement with empirical data analysis.
Then, our analysis makes it possible to explain ﬂuctuations in time intervals
from the view point of the Gini index.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we introduce a Gini
index and derive the analytical expression of the Gini index for the Weibull
distribution. We also evaluate the Gini index for empirical data and ﬁnd a
good agreement with empirical data analysis. The last section is conclusion
and discussions.

2 Gini index for a Weibull distribution

In our previous studies [9,10,11], we showed that the distribution of the time
interval between price changes of the Sony bank USD/JPY rate is approxi-
mated by a Weibull distribution. The Sony bank rate is that the Sony bank [12]
oﬀers to their individual customers on their online foreign exchange trading
service via the internet. The Sony bank rate is a kind of ﬁrst passage processes
[13,14] with above and below 0.1yen for the market rate, and once the market
rate exceeds a threshold, the process stops and restarts at the updated Sony
bank rate. Thus, the mean ﬁrst passage time of the Sony bank rate is ∼ 20
minutes [9], which is longer than the mean time intervals of the market rate
(∼ 7 seconds).

In this section, we investigate the Lorentz curve and the corresponding Gini
index for a Weibull distribution. The Weibull distribution is described by

where a and m are the scale parameter, the shape parameter, respectively.
When m = 1, a Weibull distribution is identical to an exponential distribution.
In FIG. 1, we plot the Weibull distribution for several values of m with a = 1.

The Gini index is a measure of an inequality in a distribution. It is often used

in economics to measure an inequality of income or wealth in each country
or community. However, we here introduce a Gini index as a measure of an
inequality in the length of time interval between data. Namely, we try to
recognize the meaning of parameter m through the Gini index. The Gini index
takes between 0 when all intervals are equal lengths (perfect equality) and 1
when all intervals but one are zero lengths (perfect inequality).

2.1 Analytical expression of the Gini index

The Gini index is derived analytically if the corresponding “wealth distribu-
tion” is given. In this subsection, we show explicit form of the Gini index
for a Weibull distribution as the “wealth distribution”. The Gini index is
derived from the Lorentz curve. The Lorentz curve for a Weibull distribu-
r

tion is described by the following relation between X(r) =
r
tPW (t) dt. Thus, we have the Lorentz curve for a

We next calculate the Gini index that is given as twice an area between the
perfect equality line Y = X and the Lorentz curve. Carrying out some simple
algebra, we have the Gini index G as follows.

It should be noticed that the Gini index G for a Weibull distribution is inde-
pendent of the scale parameter a. In FIG. 2 (lower panel), we plot the Gini
index G as a function of m. We ﬁnd that the Gini index G monotonically de-
creases as m increases. This means that for small m, long intervals are merely
generated from the Weibull distribution, whereas, short intervals are gener-
ated with high probability. As a result, the inequality of the interval length
becomes quite large and the Gini index has a value close to 1. For large m,
on the other hand, similar interval lengths are generated from the Weibull
distribution. As a result, the inequality is small and the Gini index is close to
zero. Therefore, now the shape of the Weibull distribution was explained from
the view point of the inequality of interval length, namely, the Gini index. As

4

a special case, substituting m = 1 into (3) we can check the Gini index is
G = 0.5 for exponential distribution, which is caused by the Poisson arrival
process of price changes.

Since the empirical value of m is about 0.585 for our data set, which is around
31,000 data from September 2002 to May 2004, the analytical expression of
the Gini index gives G = 0.694168, which means more variations than the
Poisson arrival process of price changes. Therefore, the Sony bank rate has
mainly short intervals and few long intervals.

2.2 Gini index for empirical data

For comparison, we next derive the Gini index for empirical data, that is,
the Gini index for discrete probabilistic variables [15]. Given a sample of N
intervals with the length xi in non-decreasing order (x1 ≤ x2 ≤ · · · ≤ xN ).
Discrete probabilistic variables Xi and Yi, which are ingredients of the Lorenz
r=1 xr = (µN)−1
i
curve, are given by Xi = i/N and Yi =
r=1 xr
for i = 1, 2, · · · , N. A parameter µ denotes the mean length µ = N −1
i
r=1 xr
and X0 and Y0 are set to zero. Thus, the Gini index for the discrete empirical
data can be obtained as follows.

From (4) the empirical result of the Gini index for the Sony bank rate is
G = 0.693079, which is very close to the Gini index for the estimated Weibull
distribution G = 0.694168 from (3). We ﬁnd that the Weibull distribution is
a plausible candidate for the time interval distribution of the Sony bank rate
in terms of the Gini index. The detail calculations of the Gini index will be
reported in our forthcoming paper [16].

3 Conclusion and dicussions

In this paper, we proposed an approach to explain ﬂuctuations in time in-
tervals of ﬁnancial markets data from the view point of the Gini index. We
showed the explicit form of the Gini index for a Weibull distribution which is a
good candidate to describe the ﬁrst passage time of foreign exchange rate. The
analytical expression gave the very close value to the empirical data analysis.
More precisely, we previously found that the tails of the time interval distri-
bution changes its shape from Weibull-law to power-law [10]. However, even
if without the correction of the power-law tail, the Gini index for a Weibull

5

distribution is in a good agreement with the empirical result. It is reasonably
expected that the tails of the distribution does not have a signiﬁcant eﬀect
on the Gini index. Finally, our approach can be applicable to other stochastic
processes to explain ﬂuctuations in intervals.

One of the authors (N.S.) would like to appreciate Shigeru Ishi, President of
the Sony bank, for kindly providing the Sony bank data and useful discussions.

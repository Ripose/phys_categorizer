The temporal ﬂuctuations of produced hadron density in heavy ion collisions, modelled by 2D
Ising model at temperatures Tc and below, are studied through a recently developed wavelet based
ﬂuctuation analysis method. At Tc, long-range correlated multifractal behavior, matching with the
recently observed Hurst exponent H ≃ 1, is found. Below Tc uncorrelated monofractal behavior
is seen. The correlation behavior compares well with the results obtained from continuous wavelet
based average wavelet co-eﬃcient method, as well as with Fourier power spectral analysis.

INTRODUCTION

The study of correlations and scaling behavior is an
area of active research [1]. Various methods of anal-
ysis like rescaled range analysis [2], structure func-
tion [3], wavelet transform modulus maxima [4], de-
trended ﬂuctuation analysis and its variants are used to
study the correlation behavior and fractal characteristics
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Recently, we have developed
a new method based on discrete wavelet transform to
study the scaling properties of non-stationary time series
[13]. This procedure economically extracts the multi-
fractal behavior in a time series. It has been applied to
characterize current and voltage ﬂuctuations in tokamak
plasma and ﬁnancial time series [14].

The goal of the present work is to apply this discrete
wavelet based approach for the study of event by event
ﬂuctuations of hadron density produced during phase
transition. The fact that, our method is a local one,
makes it ideal for the analysis of ﬂuctuations in a non-
stationary data. The primary motivation for this work
is the recent study of the event by event ﬂuctuations of
hadron multiplicities, carried out by Qin and Ta-chung,
[15, 16] using rescaled range analysis, which has shown
scaling behavior. The Hurst exponent H, has been found
to be 1. The geometry of the hadronization scenario in
the context of heavy ion collisions, with two ﬂavors, has
led to the description of the same through a model like
two dimensional (2D) Ising model. Hwa and co-workers
have analyzed the scaling behavior of hadronic ﬂuctua-
tions through various methods like moment analysis etc.,
in the context of the above model [17, 18, 19, 20].

A large number of studies have been done to analyze
the characteristic behavior of hadron formation during
quark hadron phase transition. Earlier studies regard-
ing the ﬂuctuations in particle production, like corre-
lation analysis of hadronic ﬂuctuations have been car-
ried out using cluster expansion technique of Ursell and
Mayer [21]. Bialas and Peschanski have studied multi-
particle production during quark hadron phase transition
through factorial moment analysis [22]. Using statistical
methods, Ludlam and Slansky studied the mechanism of

Following Hwa et.

[17], we have carried out
the Monte-Carlo simulation of 2D Ising model to mimic
the multi-particle production during quark hadron phase
transition. The time series of event by event ﬂuctua-
tions of average hadron densities below and at phase
transition have been measured for characterization. The
spatio-temporal ﬂuctuations of produced hadrons show
correlation behavior which have been characterized us-
ing wavelet transform techniques. We have made use
of discrete and continuous wavelet transforms to analyze
the hadronic ﬂuctuations at various temperatures below
and at critical temperature. We also study the scaling
behavior through power spectral analysis.

Wavelet transform is a mathematical tool which ﬁnds
applications in various ﬁelds, ranging from ﬁnance [14,
24], biology [25, 26], to chemistry [27], and physics
[4, 28, 29] etc. Wavelet transform decomposes any given
function or data in a manner, which achieves optimal
time-frequency localization. Wavelets are classiﬁed into

discrete and continuous ones [30, 31]. We have made
use of both the methods to analyze the ﬂuctuations in
this paper. In case of discrete wavelet analysis, we have
used an approach which has been developed recently [13].
Average wavelet coeﬃcient method, a continuous wavelet
approach as well as Fourier analysis are also used to study
the correlation behavior of the ﬂuctuations and corrobo-
rate our ﬁndings.

This paper is organized as follows. Section II deals
with hadron density as computed from the Ising model.
In Section III, discrete wavelet analysis of time series
has been carried out for extracting multifractal behavior.
In section IV, continuous wavelet analysis and Fourier
power spectral analysis have been implemented to sup-
port the previous discrete wavelet transform approach.
Section V concludes with discussions and future direc-
tions of work.

2. HADRON DENSITY AND THE ISING
MODEL

In the context of heavy ion collisions, a two dimen-
sional geometry can be invoked, where 2D Ising model
captures the dynamics of the phase transition in a two
ﬂavor scenario. Earlier studies by Hwa et.al., [17] de-
scribe in detail the relationship between hadron density
and the 2D Ising model. In this paper, we adopt the same
procedure and deal with the correlation analysis and frac-
tal characteristics through wavelet transforms. We have
studied the hadronic ﬂuctuations using both discrete and
continuous wavelet transform as a time series analysis.

The two dimensional Ising model is deﬁned by the

Hamiltonian,

where s takes the values
1 and the sum is over the
±
nearest neighbors. In our Monte-Carlo simulation of 2D
Ising model [32], we use Wolﬀ single cluster algorithm
[33] for spin ﬂipping in a conﬁguration of a lattice size
L = 256. We deﬁne the cell size to be ǫ2 with ǫ = 4 and
the whole lattice is subdivided into l = (L/ǫ)2 cells. The
hadron density at a particular cell is deﬁned by

ρi = λ c2

i Θ (ci) ,

where ci is the net spin at cell i deﬁned to be positive
along the overall magnetization, i.e.,

ci = 

Ai is the cell block of size ǫ2 located at i, Θ is the Heavi-
side function and λ is a constant. During the hadroniza-
tion process ci ﬂuctuates from cell to cell, which reﬂects

in the average hadron density in event to event. The
average density is calculated as;

Here, i denotes the cells and e is the conﬁgurations cap-
tured, where N is the number of events simulated. We
have calculated the equilibrium time series of the average
hadron density over N = 5 x 105 iterations.

3. WAVELET BASED FLUCTUATION
ANALYSIS

Considering the time series of average hadron density
(
i) from i = 1, ..., N , we capture conﬁgurations at var-
ρ
i
h
ious temperatures like below, and at critical temperature.
In most applications, the index i will correspond to the
time of the measurements. The proﬁle (Yi) of the time
series is obtained by subtracting the mean and taking
cumulative sum of the average hadron density. The pro-
ﬁles have been analyzed by the wavelet based ﬂuctuation
analysis method to study the scaling behavior [13]. We
calculate the scaling exponents h(q) for various moments
q, in this case q varies from
10 to 10. For q = 2, h(q) is
−
the Hurst exponent, which is one of the measures of cor-
relation behavior in the time series analysis: 0
1.
For persistent time series H > 0.5, H = 0.5 for uncor-
related time series and H < 0.5 for anti-persistent be-
havior. Recently, the anti-persistent regime 0 < H < 0.5
has been mapped to ∆3 statistics, widely employed in
random matrix theory [34]. The main aim here is to
study the fractal characteristics of the time series and its
multifractal nature. For the time series possessing multi-
fractal behavior, h(q) decreases with increasing values of
q. For mono-fractal time series h(q) is constant for all
values of q. Fig. 1 depicts the proﬁle of the time series
of event by event ﬂuctuations of average hadron density,
[a] below Tc, and [b] at Tc.

We use a discrete wavelet based ﬂuctuation analysis
method (which is analogous to multifractal detrended
ﬂuctuation analysis method) to study the existence of
scaling behavior of the time series. Our earlier paper
gives the detail procedure of this approach [13]. The
ﬂuctuations are extracted using a wavelet (Db-8) from
Daubechies family. The ﬂuctuation function Fq(s) is ob-
tained for various scales s. The power law manifests itself
as a straight line in the log-log plot of Fq(s) versus s, for
each value of q.

From the analysis of hadron density time series, below Tc,
uncorrelated monofractal behavior and long-range corre-
lated multifractal behavior at Tc are found. These results
are shown in Fig. 2. It was found that the Hurst expo-
nent H = h(q = 2)
1 matches with that of Qin et. al.
[? ]. Very interestingly, multifractal behavior is clearly
seen for event by event ﬂuctuations at Tc.

4. AVERAGE WAVELET COEFFICIENT
METHOD

We now make use of average wavelet coeﬃcient method
to corroborate the above ﬁndings. This is a continuous
wavelet based approach, which has been used to study
the temporal correlations of the ﬂuctuations in time se-
ries. We obtain the Hurst measure by transforming the
time series, f (t) into wavelet domain. The continuous
wavelet transform of a function f (x) is given by

W [f ](a, b) =

At a given scale, the wavelet energy of all locations
have been averaged yielding W [f ](a). The same averag-
ing is followed for all scales. Thus for a self-aﬃne time
series, the scaling exponent ( 1
2 + H) is measured from
the slope of the log-log plot of W [f ](a) versus scale a.
The results are shown in Fig. 3. They clearly indicate
that the ﬂuctuations possess self-aﬃne nature and the
Hurst exponent is the measure of correlation. From the
obtained H, we found that the hadronic ﬂuctuations are
uncorrelated below Tc (H = 0.5) and at Tc it possesses

5. CONCLUSION

We have found that the event by event ﬂuctuations of
hadron density, as modelled by 2D Ising spins, possess
long-range correlated multifractal and fractional Brown-
ian motion behavior at Tc. This is due to the correlation
arising from phase transition. Uncorrelated monofractal
and Brownian motion behavior below Tc is observed as

per physical expectations. The analysis has been carried
out through discrete wavelet wavelet based ﬂuctuation
analysis method, which is well suited for non-stationary
data. The continuous wavelet based average wavelet co-
eﬃcient method and Fourier analysis fully supported the
above conclusion.

Abstract.
Image reconstruction in X ray tomography consists in determining an
object from its projections. In many applications such as non destructive testing, we look
for an image who has a constant value inside a region (default) and another constant
value outside that region (homogeneous region surrounding the default). The image
reconstruction problem becomes then the determination of the shape of that region. In
this work we model the object (the default region) as a polygonal disc and propose a new
method for the estimation of the coordinates of its vertices directly from a very limited
number of its projections.

Key words: Computed Imaging, Tomography, Shape reconstruction, Non destructive
testing, Regularization, Bayesian estimation, Deformable contours

Introduction

Gammagraphy is a well known technique in non destructive testing (NDT) and non
destructive evaluation (NDE) applications. Tomographic image reconstruction in
these applications is more recent and consists of determining an object from its
projections. The relation between the object f (x, y) and its projections p(r, φ) is
frequently modeled by the Radon transform:

p(r, φ) =

f (x, y)δ(r − x cos φ − y sin φ) dx dy

(1)

In many image reconstruction applications, especially in NDT and NDE, we look
for an image f (x, y) who has a constant value c1 inside a region (default region
D) and another constant value c2 outside that region (homogeneous surrounding
safe region), e.g. metal & air. The image reconstruction problem becomes then
the determination of the shape of the default region.

In this communication, without loss of generality, we assume that c1 = 1 and

c2 = 0:

f (x, y) =

(cid:26)

(x, y) ∈ D,

1 if
0 elsewhere

,

(2)

where D represents the default region.

There has been many works in image reconstruction and computed tomography
dealing with this problem. To emphasis the originality and the place of this work,
we give here a summary of the diﬀerent approaches for this problem:

2

A. Mohammad–Djafari

• In the ﬁrst approach, one starts by discretizing the equation (1) to obtain:

p = Hf + n

(3)

(4)

where, f is the discretized values of the object f (x, y) (the pixel values of the
image), p is values of the projection data p(r, φ), n is a vector to represent the
modeling and measurement errors (noise) and H the discretized Radon operator.
Then the solution is deﬁned as the argument which minimizes the regularization
criterion

J(f ) = ||p − Hf ||2 + λΩ(f ),

where λ is the regularization parameter.
Ω(f ) has to be chosen appropriately to reﬂect the fact that f must represent a bi-
nary image. This is the classical approach of general image reconstruction problem.
In fact, one can also interpret J(f ) as the maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion
in the Bayesian estimation framework where Q(f ) = ||p − Hf ||2 represents the
likelihood term and exp [−λΩ(f )] the prior probability law.

This approach has been used with success in many applications (e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4])
but the cost of its calculation is huge due to the great dimension of f . Many works
have been done on choosing appropriate regularization functionals or equivalently
appropriate prior probability laws for f to enforce some special properties of the
image such as smoothness, positivity or piecewise smoothness [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
Among these, one can mention mainly two types of functions for Ω(f ):
Entropic laws:

Ω(f ) =

φ(fj ), with φ(x) = {xp, −x log x, log x, · · ·}

N

j=1
X

Homogeneous Markovian laws:

, log cosh |x − y|, · · ·

(cid:26)

(cid:27)

x
y

See for example [6] for the entropic laws, [7, 5] for scale invariant markovian laws
and [8, 9, 10] for other speciﬁc choices.

• In the second approach, one starts by giving a parametric model for the object
and then tries to estimate these parameters using least squares (LS) or maximum
likelihood (ML) methods. In general, in this approach one chooses a parametric
model such as superposition of circular or elliptical discs to be able to relate
analytically the projections to these parameters. For example, for a superposition
of elliptical discs we have:

f (x, y) =

dkfk(x, y)

and where θ = {dk, αk, βk, ak, bk, k = 1, · · · , K} is a vector of parameters deﬁning
the parametric model of the image (density values, coordinates of the centers
and the two diameters of the ellipses). It is then easy to calculate analytically
the projections and the relation between the data and the unknown parameters
becomes:

p(r, φ) = h(r, φ; θ) + n(r, φ)

The LS or the ML estimate when the noise is assumed to be Gaussian is then
given by:

kp(r, φ) − h(r, φ; θ)k2

(10)

This approach has also been used with success in image reconstruction [11, 12, 13,
14, 15]. But, the range of applicability of these methods is limited to the cases
where the parametric models are actually appropriate.

b

• In the third approach which is more appropriate to our problem of shape recon-
struction, one starts by modeling directly the contour of the object by a function,
say g(θ) such as:

D =

(x, y) : ρ2(θ) = x2 + y2 < g2(θ)

.

(11)

The next step is then to relate the projections p(r, φ) to g(θ) which, in this case
is:

(cid:8)

p(r, φ) =

δ(r − ρ cos(φ − θ))ρ dρ dθ.

(12)

2π

g(θ)

Z

and ﬁnally to discretize this relation to obtain:

(cid:9)

(cid:9)

p = h(g) + n

where g represents the discretized values of g(θ) deﬁning the contour of the object
and h(g) represents the discretized version of the nonlinear operator (12) relating
projection data p and g. Then, one deﬁnes the solution as the argument which
minimizes

J(g) = ||p − h(g)||2 + λΩ(g),

(13)

(14)

4

A. Mohammad–Djafari

where Ω(g) has to be chosen appropriately to reﬂect some regularity property of
the object’s contour.

In this case also one can consider J(g) as the MAP criterion with Q(g) =

||p − h(g)||2 as the likelihood term and Ω(g) as the prior one.
This approach has been used in image restoration [16], but it seems to be new in
image reconstruction applications and the proposed method in this work is in this
category. The originality of our work is to model the contour of the object by a
piecewise linear function which means that the object is modeled as a polygonal
disc whose vertices are estimated directly from the projection data.

Now before going further in details, let compare this last approach with the

ﬁrst one, by noting the following:

• In (3) and (4), f represents the pixel values of the image (a very great dimensional
vector depending on the image dimensions), but in (13) and (14), g represents the
discretized values of g(θ) deﬁning the contour of the object. The dimension of this
vector is moderate and independent of the image dimensions.

• In (3) and (4), Hf is a linear function of f and so Q(f ) is a quadratic function
of it, but in (13) and (14), h(g) is not a linear function of g and so Q(g) will not
be a quadratic function of it.
We will discuss more the consequences of these remarks in the next section.

2. Proposed method

In this paper we propose to model the contour of the object (default region) as
a periodic piecewise linear function or equivalently to model the shape of the
object as a polygonal disc with a great number N of vertices to be able to
approximate any shape. Then we propose to estimate directly the coordinates
{(xj, yj), j = 1, · · · , N } of the vertices of this polygonal disc from the projection
data (see Fig. 2.).

The idea of modeling the shape of the object as a polygonal disc is not new and
some works have been done in image reconstruction applications, but, in general
in these works, a hypothesis of convexity of the polygonal disc has been used which
is very restrictive in real applications. In our work we do not make this hypothesis
and also we choose N appropriately great to to be able to approximate any shape.
As we deal with inverse problems, the solution is then deﬁned as the argument

which minimizes the following criterion

J(z) = ||p − h(z)||2 + λΩ(z),

(15)

where z = x + iy is a complex vector whose real and imaginary parts represent
the x and the y coordinates of the polygon vertices, h(z) represents the direct
operator which calculates the projections for any given z and Ω(z) is chosen to
be a function which reﬂects the regularity of the object contour. In this work we
used the following:

Ω(z) =

|zj−1 − 2zj + zj+1|2.

Note that |zj−1−2zj+zj+1|2 is just the Euclidian distance between the point zj and
the line segment passing through zj−1 and zj+1 and so this choice favors a shape
whose local curvature is limited. We can also give a probabilistic interpretation
to this choice. In fact we can consider zj as random variables with the following
Markovian law:

p(zj|z) = p(zj|zj−1, zj+1) ∝ exp

(cid:21)

(cid:20)

(17)

Other functions are possible and are studied in this work.

In both cases, the criterion J(z) is multimodal essentially due to the fact that
h(z) is a nonlinear function of z. Calculating the optimal solution corresponding
to the global minimum of (15) needs then carefully designed algorithms. For this
we propose the following strategies:

• The ﬁrst is to use a global optimization technique such as simulated anneal-
ing (SA). This technique has given satisfactory result as it can be seen from the
simulations in the next section. However, this algorithm needs a great number of
iterations and some skills for choosing the ﬁrst temperature and cooling schedule,
but the overall calculations is not very important due to the fact that we do not
need to calculate the gradient of the criterion (15).

• The second is to ﬁnd an initial solution in the attractive region of the global
optimum and to use a local descent type algorithm to ﬁnd the solution.

The main problem here is how to ﬁnd this initial solution. For this, we used
a moment based method proposed by Milanfar, Karl & Wilsky [17, 18] which
is accurate enough to obtain an initial solution which is not very far from the
optimum. The basic idea of this method is to relate the moments of the projections
to the moments of a class of polygonal discs obtained by an aﬃne transformation

6

A. Mohammad–Djafari

of a centered regular polygonal disc, and so to estimate a polygonal disc whose
vertices are on an ellipse and whose moments up to the second order matches those
of the projections.

However, there is no theoretical proof that this initial solution will be in the
attractive region of the global optimum. In the simulation results section we will
show some results comparing the performances of these two methods as well as a
comparison with some other classical methods.

3. Simulation results

To measure the performances of the proposed method and keeping the objective
of using this method for NDT applications where the number of projections are
very limited, we simulated a case where the object is a polygonal disc with N = 40
vertices (hand-made) and calculated its projections for only 5 directions:

Then, we added some noise (white, Gaussian and centered) on them to simulate
the measurement errors. The S/N ratio was chosen 20dB. Finally, from these data
we estimated the solution by either of the two proposed methods. Figures 3. and
3. show these results.

In Fig. 3., we give the reconstruction results obtained by simulated annealing
(SA) algorithm and in Fig. 3. those obtained by a moment-based initialization and
a local descent-based optimization algorithm. Note that, the SA is independent
of initialization, however, in these ﬁgures we show the results obtained by the
proposed method.

In Fig. 3. we show a comparison between the results obtained by the proposed
method and those obtained either by a classical backprojection method or by some
other methods in the ﬁrst approach using (3) and (4) with diﬀerent regularization
functionals Ω(f ) among those in (5). Also, for the purpose of curiosity we show
the result of a binary segmented image obtained by thresholding these last images.

4. Conclusions

A new method for tomographic image reconstruction of a compact object from its
limited angle projections is proposed. The basic idea of the proposed method is
to model the object as a polygonal disc whose vertices coordinates are estimated
directly from the projections using the Bayesian MAP estimation framework or
equivalently by optimizing a regularized criterion.

This criterion is not unimodal. To optimize it two methods are examined: a
global optimization method based on simulated annealing and a local gradient-
based method with a good initialization obtained using a moment based method.
The ﬁrst one seems to give entire satisfaction and better results. The ﬁnal destina-
tion of the proposed method is for non destructive testing (NDT) and evaluation
(NDE) image reconstruction applications including X-rays, ultrasound or Eddy
currents [19, 20, 21].

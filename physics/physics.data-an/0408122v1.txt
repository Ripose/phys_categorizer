Abstract

We discuss some aspects of Astumian suggestions that combination of
biased games (Parrondo’s paradox) can explain performance of molecular
motors. Unfortunately the model is ﬂawed by explicit asymmetry over-
looked by the author. In addition, we show that taking into consideration
stakes allows to remove the paradoxical behaviour of Parrondo games.

Keywords: Parrondo’s paradox; random games; martingales; random walk; ran-
dom transport.

Motto: Nothing gets out of nothing. [1]

The celebrated Parrondo’s paradox [2, 3] consisting in asymmetrical combina-
tion of doomed games so that the resulting new game is not biased or there
even is a winning strategy caused much excitement and, unfortunately, mis-
understanding. R. D. Astumian [4] considers in a recent article in Scientiﬁc
American a game based on the presented below diagram. The game consist in
jumping between ﬁve diﬀerent states 1, . . . , 5:

where the numbers written above or below the arrows are the probabilities of
transitions between neighboring states (only such transitions are allowed). The
player wins if she (or he) winds up in the state 5 and loses if she reach the
state 1. If the player starts from the state 3 the probability of losing is equal
to 5

probabilities of defeat and success is given by the proportion of products of the
appropriate transition probabilities

p(3 → 2) p(2 → 1)

(though it is not true that p3(1) = p(3 → 2) p(2 → 1) nor p3(5) = p(3 →
4) p(4 → 5)). The given above formula has a clear gambling interpretation.
Consider the function M (n) (represented in graphic form in Eq. (1)):

states 1 and 5 are absorbing ones.

M (n) is a martingale [5] that gives capital in a fair game, that is in such stochas-
tic process that at any moment t:

E(M (nt+1)|M (n0), ..., M (nt)) = E(M (nt+1)|M (nt)) = M (nt)

(3)

(a ﬁnite Markov chain). The states 1 and 5 are absorbing, therefore

0 = M (3) = E(M (n∞)|n0 = 3) = p3(1)M (1) + p3(5)M (5)

(4)

and (2) follows. The same numerical result might be obtained in the game

with diﬀerent transition probabilities. Astumian suggests that in a modiﬁed
game with the transition probabilities being arithmetic mean of the probabilities
of both above described games that is the game given by

the probability of success is greater than the probability of defeat. He calls it the
player paradox. Even a superﬁcial analysis of the above diagram suggests that
this is wrong: the transitions from the states 2, 3, 4 to the left are more probable
than to the right. It seems that an elementary error in counting probabilities
resulted in drawing wrong conclusion by prof. Astumian. There is nothing
paradoxical if asymmetry put in by hand. Roughly speaking, the Parrondo’s
paradox consist in the fact that sometimes it is better to play n times game1
followed by game2 rather than n times game1 and then n times game2. Below
we give an example of a pair of stochastic processes biased towards the left
absorbing state and their equally weighted mixed process biased towards the
right absorbing state (Parondo’s paradox). Consider the following three graphs.

The numbers given at the vertices represent values of the martingales and not
their arguments. We can identify corresponding vertices of the mixed process
if we appropriately change the stakes (in general the stakes are diﬀerent). The
formalism of martingales, besides oﬀering a fast method of ﬁnding probabil-
ities of reaching the asymptotic states removes a lot of the mysteries of the
paradoxical behavior. In the mixed process the bias can be compensated by
modiﬁcation of stakes. So an increasing probability of winning not necessarily
involves increasing (expected) proﬁts.

The authors of this letter suggest the readers to calculate the probabilities of
success in games of this kind. An exemplary listing of a mini-program written
in the language Mathematica 5.0 together with results they obtained can be
found in Appendix (cf. [6, 7]).

Note that the paradox is present also in quantum games [8, 9].

An eﬀective modeling method for nonlinear distributed parameter systems (DPSs) is critical for
both physical system analysis and industrial engineering. In this Rapid Communication, we propose
a novel DPS modeling approach, in which a high-order nonlinear Volterra series is used to sepa-
rate the time/space variables. With almost no additional computational complexity, the modeling
accuracy is improved more than 20 times in average comparing with the traditional method.

Introduction - Most of the physical processes (e.g. ther-
mal diﬀusion process [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], thermal radiation
process [6], distributed quantum systems [7], concentra-
tion distribution process [8, 9], crystal growth process
[1], etc.) are nonlinear distributed parameter systems
(DPSs) with boundary conditions determined by the sys-
tem structure. Thus, it is an urgent task to design an
eﬀective modeling method for nonlinear DPSs. The key
problem in the design of nonlinear-DSP modeling method
is how to separate the time/space variables. Some mod-
eling approaches are previously proposed: These include
the Karhunen-Lo`eve (KL) approach [1, 4, 10, 11], the
spectrum analysis [12], the singular value decomposition
(SVD) combined with the Galerkin’s method [1, 13], and
so on. Among them, the KL approach is the most exten-
sively studied and the most widely applied one. In this
approach, the output T (z, t) is expanded as

T (z, t) =

ci(z)li(t) , C(z)L(t),

where z and t are the space and time variables, re-
spectively. This operation can be implemented by spa-
combined with time-domain coeﬃcients

li(t)
combined with spa-

tial coeﬃcients
. The basis could be Jacobi se-
ries [14], orthonormal functional series (OFS, such as
Laguerre series [14, 15], Kautz series [14], etc.), spline
functional series [16], trigonometric functional series, or
some others. However, no matter how elaborately the ba-
sis is designed, the model is still in a linear form, so it can
not yield satisfying modeling performance for severe non-
linearity with insuﬃciently long truncation length N . In
addition, modeling error will grow larger along with the
decrease of N . Since in practice, the truncation length

∗Electronic address: zhutou@ustc.edu

can not be very long, these traditional methods usually
fail to provide an adequately accurate model.

In this Rapid Communication, we argue that the lin-
ear separation is a bottleneck to better modeling perfor-
mance, and to introduce some kinds of nonlinear terms
may sharply enhance the performance, since they have
the capability to compensate the residuals of the linear
separation.

The Implement of Nonlinear Space/Time Separation
- For nonlinear lumping systems, if their dependencies
on past inputs decrease rapidly enough with time, their
input/output relationship can be precisely described by
Volterra series [17, 18, 19, 20]. This kind of system
is called fading memory nonlinear system (FMNS) [18],
which is well-behaved in the sense that it will not exhibit
multiple steady-states or other related phenomena like
chaotic responses. Fortunately, most industrial processes
are FMNSs. Accordingly, one can naturally extend the
concept of Volterra series from lumping systems to DPSs
by allowing each kernel to contain both time variable
t and space variable z, and then design the time/space
separation method via the so-call distributed Volterra
series (see Fig. 1 for the mechanism of this modeling
method). Firstly, the system output can be represented
by

T (z, t) = h0(z) +

compute all the OFS kernels according to the polynomial
iterations [14] or the following state equation

L(t + 1) = AL(t) + Bu(t),

where u(t) is the system input, and A and B are pre-
optimized matrices (see Ref. [21] for details). Then the
input/output relationship Eq. (4) is represented by a lin-
ear regressive form, and these spatial coeﬃcients c0(z),
C(z), D(z),
can be obtained by using the least square
estimation combined with spline interpolation [16]. Fi-
nally, the model is obtained by synthesizing the OFS ker-
nels and the spatial coeﬃcients according to Eq. (4).

Analogically, Heuberger et al. [22] introduced the higher
order OFS model. As the order increases, OFS model
can handle more complex dynamics.

Numerical Results - Consider a long, thin rod in a re-
actor as shown in Fig. 3. The reactor is fed with pure
species A and a zeroth order exothermic catalytic reac-
tion of the form A
B takes place in the rod. Since
the reaction is exothermic, a cooling medium that is in
contact with the rod is used for cooling. Assume the

series to the distributed scenario. As is shown in Fig. 10,
a KL Volterra method is designed to separate time/space
variables. Then, the time-domain complexity is handled
by the OFS-based learning, while the spatial complexity
by some curve ﬁtting techniques (e.g. spline interpola-
tion) or intelligent learning algorithms (e.g. neural net-
work, fuzzy system, etc.). This novel method is applied
on a benchmark nonlinear DPS of industrial process, a
catalytic rod. It is found that the modeling accuracy is
improved by more than 20 times in average comparing
with the traditional method, with almost no additional
computational complexity. The underlying reason may
be that the high order Volterra kernel can compensate
the residuals of the linear separation.
In addition, we
have applied this method to another two benchmark non-
linear DPSs, a rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition
process [1], and a Czochralski crystal growth process [1].
The corresponding results also strongly suggest that the
nonlinear time/space separation can greatly enhance the
modeling accuracy.

Although its superority has been demonstrated, the
KL Volterra method is just a ﬁrst attempt aiming at the
motivation of nonlinear time/space separation. Thanks
to its excellent modeling eﬃciency, this novel method is
deﬁnitely a promising one for both physical system anal-
ysis and industrial engineering. We believe that our work
can enlighten the readers on this interesting subject.

Conclusion and Discussion - Modeling method for
nonlinear DPS plays an important role in physical sys-
tem analysis and industrial engineering. Unfortunately,
there exits two essential diﬃculties in this issue, a)
distributed nature due to time-space coupled, which
causes diﬀerent temperature responses at diﬀerent loca-
tions; b) nonlinear complexity from varying working
point - diﬀerent dynamics obtained even at the same lo-
cation for a large change of working points. Owing to
these diﬃculties, previous modeling methods via linear
time/spatial separation techniques (e.g. KL approach,
spectrum analysis, SVD-Galerkin technique, etc.) can
not yield satisfying modeling performance, especially for
DPSs with severe nonlinearity. The modeling error is
caused by the nonlinear residue of the linear time/space
separation. Thus, it is naturally to expect that a non-
linear time/space separation method may yield better
modeling performance.

To validate this supposition, we design a novel model-
ing method by extending the concept of lumping Volterra

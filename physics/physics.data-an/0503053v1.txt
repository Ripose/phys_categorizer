We present a Bayesian dynamical inference method for characterizing cardiorespiratory (CR)
dynamics in humans by inverse modelling from blood pressure time-series data. This new method is
applicable to a broad range of stochastic dynamical models, and can be implemented without severe
computational demands. A simple nonlinear dynamical model is found that describes a measured
blood pressure time-series in the primary frequency band of the CR dynamics. The accuracy of
the method is investigated using surrogate data with parameters close to the parameters inferred
in the experiment. The connection of the inferred model to a well-known beat-to-beat model of the
baroreﬂex is discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Model identiﬁcation is an important method used in
both fundamental and applied research [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8] on the human cardiovascular system (CVS). Because
of the complexity of CVS dynamics and the multiplicity
of its mechanism, it is inherently diﬃcult or impossible
to isolate and study individual response mechanisms in
the intact organism [9]. In such cases mathematical mod-
els of cardiovascular control that are consistent with the
experimental data can provide valuable insights [10, 11].
Altered dynamics of the cardiovascular system is asso-
ciated with a range of cardiovascular diseases and with
increased mortality, and it is hoped that dynamical met-
rics will provide new means of evaluating autonomic ac-
tivity, and eventually form the basis for diagnostic tests
for many conditions (see e.g. [12, 13, 14]).

Despite the fact that most cardiovascular controls are
demonstrably nonlinear [8, 10, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21] and
are perturbed by stochastic inputs [8, 22, 23], oversim-
pliﬁed assumptions of model linearity [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 15, 16]
and/or determinism [10, 17] are often made in order to
make some progress in cardiovascular system identiﬁca-
tion. Such choices are often inﬂuenced more by the avail-
ability of certain statistical tools and methodologies than
by biophysical or medical considerations. It is very de-
sirable to develop reliable methods of system identiﬁca-
tion that do not have such limitations, and are capa-
ble of treating more realistic models. Such models could
be used to relate diﬃcult-to-access parameters to non-
invasively-measured data [11].

While a number of numerical schemes have been pro-
posed recently to deal with diﬀerent aspects of the in-
verse problem using linear approximations [1, 5, 24, 25],
or semi-quantitative estimations of either the strength
of some of the nonlinear terms [26] or the directional-
ity of coupling [27, 28],
inverse cardiovascular inverse
problems remain diﬃcult because of the complexity and

nonlinearity of the cardiovascular interactions, as well
as the stochasticity of many dynamical inputs to the
system. The problem of nonlinear cardiovascular sys-
tem identiﬁcation has been addressed in a number of
publications [7, 8, 32]. Nonlinearities generally require
the use of more complex and involved numerical tech-
niques [35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41], while the presence
of dynamical noise in continuous systems can introduced
systematic errors in the estimation of the model param-
eters [33, 34]. Analogous diﬃculties arise in a broad
range of problems in many scientiﬁc disciplines, including
problems in lasers [44] and molecular motors [45], in epi-
demiology [46], and in coupled matter–radiation systems
in astrophysics [47]. An obstacle to progress in these
ﬁelds is the lack of general methods of dynamical infer-
ence for stochastic nonlinear systems. Accordingly the
methods described in this paper should be of broad in-
terdisciplinary interest.

In this paper we introduce a novel method for the
analysis of cardiorespiratory dynamics within a nonlin-
ear Bayesian framework for the inference of stochastic
dynamical systems [34]. This method is applied to the
analysis of a univariate blood pressure time-series where
a simple nonlinear dynamical model based on coupled
nonlinear oscillators [19, 42, 43]. is found that describes
time-series data in the relevant frequency range. The ac-
curacy of the method is investigated using surrogate data
with parameters close to the parameters inferred in the
experiment, and the connection of this model to a well-
known beat-to-beat model of the baroreﬂex is discussed.

II. THE METHODOLGY

In the methodological framework presented here there
are three essential steps: (i) the input data is prepared,
(ii) a parameterized class of models chosen that describes
the data, and (iii) the parameters of this model are in-
ferred from the time-series data.

A. Data

Here we worked with a particular recording of the cen-
tral venous blood pressure, a sample of which is shown
in the Fig. 1(a). A feature this blood pressure (BP)
time-series is the presence of the two oscillatory com-
ponents at frequencies approximately fr ≈ 0.2 Hz and
fc ≈ 1.7 Hz corresponding to the respiratory and cardiac
oscillations.
It can also be clearly seen from the spec-
tra that the nonlinear terms including terms of nonlinear
cardiorespiratory interaction (corresponding to the side
peaks) are very visible in this sample. We note that the
relative intensity and position of the cardiac and respi-
ratory components vary strongly from sample to sample
with average frequency of the respiration being around
0.3 Hz and of the heart beat being around 1.1 Hz.

In preparing cardiovascular data for model identiﬁca-
tion one has to bear in mind that the CVS power spectra
reﬂect a large variety of complex cardiovascular interac-
tions seen as peaks and other features in a very broad
frequency range [22, 60, 61, 62]. In order to make sense
of these multi-scale phenomena parametric modelling is
usually restricted to a speciﬁc part of the power spec-
trum. It is clear that in modelling the cardiorespiratory
interaction the frequency range of modelling must include
at least main harmonics of cardiac and respiratory oscil-
lations fc and fr and their combinational frequencies.
Moreover, as was pointed out already by Womersley (see
e.g. [63] cf. also with [64]) locally measured blood pres-
sure signals resembles a steady-state oscillations and the
sum of the ﬁrst three harmonics contains more then 70%
of the total signal variance. Therefore, it is desirable that
at least three harmonics (see also discussion below) of the
basic frequencies of the respiratory and cardiac oscilla-
tions are included into the frequency range of modelling.

B. Models

When one considers modelling the cardiovascular sys-
tem, one usually envisions constructing a model based
on biophysical principles that is capable of generating
solutions that reproduce, to some degree, the data: the
forward modelling problem (see e.g. [10, 17, 23, 48]).
One may also consider the inverse modelling problem, in
which models are built that describe measured data (see
e.g. [1, 3, 4, 5, 32]). Both approaches have proven useful
in the context of the cardiovascular research with forward
approach providing valuable insight into the system and
its causal relationships, and the inverse approach provid-
ing a useful means of intelligent patient monitoring of
cardiovascular function.

As a third alternative one may try to bridge the two ap-
proaches by building a model that accurately reproduces
the experimental observations while at the same time is
based on the biophysical principles of circulation. In such
a case the form of the mathematical model is taken from
biophysical principles, with its component parts corre-

2

sponding to a greater or lesser degree to speciﬁc biophys-
ical mechanisms, while the values of some or all of the pa-
rameters of the mathematical model are inferred directly
from from the data. In such a case it is to be hoped that
information with direct biophysical signiﬁcance, and not
mere mathematical or statistical characterizations can be
inferred from the data.

Many studies have been carried out to explore the
physiological mechanisms underlying cardiorespiratory
interactions [49, 50, 51]. The most important ones are
the modulation of cardiac ﬁlling pressure by respira-
tory movements [52], the direct respiratory modulation of
parasympathetic and sympathetic neural activity in the
brain stem [53], and the respiratory modulation of the
baroreceptor feedback control [54]. A common feature
that these mechanisms is that they are nonlinear, have
a dynamical (or memory) component, and are subject to
exogenous ﬂuctuations [7, 19, 42, 55, 56, 57, 58].

A simple beat-to-beat model describing the cardio-
respiratory systems DeBoer et al. [48, 59]. The DeBoer
model has further been elaborated recently in [10, 11, 23].
Insight into cardio-respiratory dynamics can also be
gained through inverse modelling where the cardiac and
respiratory cycles are modelled in terms of coupled non-
linear oscillators [19, 22, 42, 43, 60].
In this approach
spectral and synchronization features observed in the
time-series data are interpreted physiologically, and re-
lated to the model parameters [19]. However, the iden-
tiﬁcation of the model parameters could not be inferred
directly from the time-series data. Instead an extensive
computer simulations have been employed to establish
realistic values for the model parameters [22].

The simplest model that could reproduce steady-state
oscillations of the blood pressure signal at two fundamen-
tal frequencies is a system of two coupled limit cycles
on a plane. According to the results of the Poincar´e-
Bendixson theory of planar dynamical systems for a sys-
tem to have limit cycle in a simply connected region the
divergence of the vector ﬁeld must change sign in this
region (see e.g. [65]). Therefore, we conclude, that the
simplest system that can reproduced the discussed fea-
tures of the BP signal is planar systems with limit cycles
which vector ﬁeld contains polynomials of the order 3.
Accordingly, we model the time-series data as a system of
two coupled oscillators with vector ﬁelds including non-
linearities (including nonlinearities in coupling terms) up
to the 3-rd order in the form

The restrictions imposed on the rhs of the equations for
˙xr and ˙xc in (1) and (2) are determined mainly by the
fact that we have to infer four hidden dynamical vari-
ables using univariate time-series data (see next section
for further details). The parametric representation (1)
and (2) covers a wide range of models with limit cycles
in the plane. In particular, with a special choice of the
model parameters it describes van der Pol or FitzHugh-
Nagumo oscillator systems that are very popular in the
context of the cardiovascular modelling. Furthermore,
the choice of the parametric model in the form (1) and
(2) allows one to relate them to physiological parameters

characterizing autonomous nervous system (see section
VI for the discussion). See [19] for the alternative choice
and corresponding physiological reasoning.

C. Parameters

Following the logic of the inverse modelling ap-
proach, we must then identify the parameters M =
{a, b, α, β, D} of the model (1), (2) that reproduce the
dynamical and spectral features of the BP signal shown
1. Terms representing nonlinear cardio-
in the Fig.
respiratory interactions are described by the last three
base functions in (3). The correspondence of these terms
to the experimentally observed combinational frequen-
cies in the BP signal is summarized in the Fig. 2.

frequencies correspond to the nonlinear coupling terms
in both limit cycle systems in the model therefore a non-
linear time-series analysis is a requirement for the iden-
tiﬁcation of such a model.

Here we show how the task of identifying a model of the
cardiovascular system based on coupled nonlinear oscil-
lators can be performed systematically within a Bayesian
statistical framework. In this approach parameters of the
model can be inferred directly from the time-series data.
We also discuss brieﬂy how the links between the coupled
oscillator model and beat-to-beat models can in principle
be established.

III. BAYESIAN INFERENCE OF STOCHASTIC
NONLINEAR DYNAMICAL MODELS

Details of our new Bayesian technique can be found
elsewhere [34]. Here we give a brief description of the
main steps of the algorithm.

Stochastic nonlinear dynamical models of the type (1),
(2) can be expressed as a multi-dimensional nonlinear
Langevin equation

˙x(t) = f (x) + ε(t) = f (x) + σξ(t),

(4)

where ε(t) is an additive stationary white, Gaussian vec-
tor noise process characterized by

hξ(t)i = 0,

hξ(t) ξT (t

)i = ˆD δ(t − t

′

′

),

(5)

where ˆD is a diﬀusion matrix.

It is assumed that the trajectory x(t) of this system is
observed at sequential time instants {tk; k = 0, 1, . . . , K}
and a series S = {sk ≡ s(tk)} thus obtained is related to
the (unknown) “true” system states X = {xk ≡ x(tk)}
through some conditional PDF po (S|X ).

An a priori expert knowledge about the model param-
eters is summarized in so-called prior PDF ppr(M). In

4

our case we chose prior in the form of zero-mean Gaussian
distribution for model parameters and uniform distribu-
tions for the coeﬃcients of diﬀusion matrix.

If experimental time-series data S are available they
can be used to improve the estimation of the model pa-
rameters. The improved knowledge of the models pa-
rameters is summarized in the posterior conditional PDF
ppost(M|S), which is related to prior via Bayes’ theorem:

ppost(M|S) =

ℓ(S|M) ppr(M)
ℓ(S|M) ppr(M) dM

.

(6)

R

Here ℓ(S|M), usually termed the likelihood, is the con-
ditional PDF that relates measurements S to the dy-
namical model. The determinant on the right hand
side of the equation (6) is merely a normalization fac-
tor.
In practice, (6) can be applied iteratively using a
sequence of data blocks S, S′, etc. The posterior com-
puted from block S serves as the prior for the next block
S′, etc. For a suﬃciently large number of observations,
ppost(M|S, S′, . . .) is sharply peaked at a certain most
probable model M = M∗.

The main eﬀorts in the research on stochastic nonlinear
dynamical inference are focused on constructing the like-
lihood function, which compensates noise induced errors,
and on introducing eﬃcient algorithms of optimization of
the likelihood function and integration of the normaliza-
tion factor (cf. [33, 35, 36, 66]).

In our earlier work [34] a novel technique of nonlinear
dynamical inference of stochastic systems was introduced
that solves both problems. To avoid extensive numerical
methods of optimization of the likelihood function and
integration of the normalization factor we suggested to
parameterize the vector ﬁeld of (4) in the form

f (x) = ˆU(x) c ≡ f (x; c),

(7)

where ˆU(x) is an N × M matrix of suitably chosen basis
functions {Unm(x); n = 1 : N, m = 1 : M }, and c is an
M -dimensional coeﬃcient vector. An important feature
of (7) is that, while possibly highly nonlinear in x, f (x; c)
is strictly linear in c.

The computation of the likelihood function can be cast
in the form of a path integral over the random trajecto-
ries of the system [67, 68]. Using the uniform sampling
scheme introduced above we can write the logarithm of
the likelihood function in the following form for suﬃ-
ciently small time step h (cf. [67, 68]):

which relates the dynamical variables x(t) of the system
(4) to the observations s(t). Here we introduce the fol-
lowing notations ˆUk ≡ ˆU(yk), ˙yk ≡ h−1(yk+1 − yk) and

vector v(x) with components

and substituting ppr(M) and the likelihood ℓ(S|M)
into (6) yields the posterior ppost(M|S) = const ×

The mean values of c and ˆD in the posterior distribu-
tion give the best estimates for the model parameters for
a given block of data S of length K and provide a global
minimum to Ls(c, ˆD). We handle this optimization prob-
lem in the following way. Assume for the moment that c
is known in (10). Then the posterior distribution over ˆD
has a mean ˆD′
post = ˆΘs(c) that provides a minimum to
Ss(c, ˆD) with respect to ˆD = ˆDT . Its matrix elements

Alternatively, assume next that ˆD is known, and note
from (10) that in this case the posterior distribution over
c is Gaussian. Its covariance is given by ˆΞs( ˆD) and the

We repeat this two-step optimization procedure itera-
tively, starting from some prior values cpr and ˆΣpr.

IV. ESTIMATION OF PARAMETERS OF
CARDIORESPIRATORY INTERACTION FROM
UNIVARIATE TIME-SERIES DATA (REAL
DATA)

In order to apply algorithm (12)-(15) for the identiﬁ-
cation of the model of nonlinear cardio-respiratory dy-
namics (1), (2) from the univariate BP time-series of the
type shown in Fig. 1(a) we have to extract time-series
data corresponding to the four dynamical variable in the
model. Accordingly we divide the total spectrum into
a low-frequency respiratory component sr(t) and high-
frequency cardiac component sc(t) as is shown in Fig.
1(c) and (e).

A discussion of the physiological relevance of this spec-
tral separation can be found in [19, 43]). However, it
is perfectly correct to consider this separation a mathe-
matical ansatz. Physiological considerations need only
come into play at the point where we attempt place
a speciﬁc biophysical interpretation of the model ele-
ments. The parameters of the ﬁlters (see Fig. 1 caption)
were chosento preserve the 2-nd and 3-rd harmonics of
these signals. Then two xr(t) and xc(t) dynamical vari-
ables of the model (1), (2) can be identiﬁed with intro-
duced above two-dimensional time-series of observations
s(t) = {sr(t), sc(t)}. The remaining two dynamical vari-
ables y(t) = {yr(t), yc(t)} can be related to the observa-
tions {s(tk)} as follows

bnyn(tk) =

sn(tk + h) − sn(tk)
h

+ ansn(tk),

(16)

where n = r, c. The relation (16) is a special form of em-
bedding that allows one to infer a wider class of dynami-
cal models of the cardiorespiratory interactions including
models in the form of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators. It is
clear now that we have introduced the restrictions on the
form of the rhs of the ﬁrst equations in (1), (2) to reduce
the number of parameters of embedding that have to be
selected to minimize the cost (10) and provide the best
ﬁt to the measured time series {s(tk)}. The correspond-
ing simpliﬁed model of the nonlinear interaction between
the cardiac and respiratory limit cycles can now be writ-
ten in the form corresponding to parametrization (7) as
follows

˙y = ˆU(s, y)c + ξ(t),

(17)

where ξ(t) is a two-dimensional Gaussian white noise
with correlation matrix ˆD, and the matrix ˆU will have
the following block structure

ˆU =

Finally, the model (17), (18) has to be inferred using
method described in the previous section. The compari-

tained for the respiratory oscillator as shown in the Fig.
4.
In particular, the parameters of the nonlinear cou-
pling and of the noise intensity of the cardiac oscillations
have been estimated to have the following values β20 =
2.2, β21 = 0.27, β22 = −8.67, and hξ2
c (t)i = 8.13. While
parameters of the coupling of respiratory oscillations to
the cardiac oscillations were estimated to have the follow-
ing values α20 = 0.12, α21 = 0.048, α22 = −0.066, and
D11 = 0.18 . Consistent with expectations, in all experi-
ments the parameters of the nonlinear coupling are more
then one order of magnitude higher for the cardiac os-
cillations as compared to their values for the respiratory
oscillations reﬂecting the fact that respiration strongly
modulates cardiac oscillations, while the opposite eﬀect

of the cardiac oscillations on respiration is weak.

We have shown that it possible using these methods to
simultaneously infer the coupling strengths and noise pa-
rameters nonlinear cardio-respiratory dynamics directly
from a non-invasively measured time series. We view
this demonstration of principle as a ﬁrst step towards the
practical use this technique for cardio-respiratory mod-
elling and and in clinical applications. A number of very
important physiological and mathematical issues arise in
relation to the application of this new technique to spe-
ciﬁc problems. We hope to address many of these in
future publications. In what follow here we speciﬁcally
consider the problem of estimating of the accuracy of the
method, and begin the discussion of the connection be-
tween inferred parameters and the indexes of autonomous
cardiovascular controls.

V. VALIDATION OF THE METHOD USING
SURROGATE TIME-SERIES DATA

It is desirable to check performance of the method on
surrogate time-series data obtained by numerically sim-
ulating the model (1), (2)with the parameters measured
with the CVS data.

To this end we consider a surrogate signal x(t) =
xr(t) + xc(t) as a time-series data input s(t) for the in-
ference. Here xr(t), xc(t) are obtained using numerical
simulations of the model (1), (2) with the parameters
taken from the inference of the experimental BP signal
described in the previous section.

First we verify that the decomposition of the input
signal s(t) into low-frequency ˜sr and high-frequency ˜sc
harmonics using two band-pass Butterworth ﬁlters and
subsequent application of the embedding procedure (16)
allows one to reconstruct the original signal. In the Fig.
5 we compare the velocity of the respiratory component
of the original signal yr(t) with the the reconstructed
velocity ˜yr(t). Similar results are obtained for the recon-
struction of the high-frequency component. We notice in
particular that the noise introduced by embedding can
be neglected since it is more then order of magnitude
smaller then the dynamical noise in the signal.

Now we can apply inference procedure described in the
previous section to estimate nonlinear coupling param-
eters of the model from the univariate surrogate time-
series data. The results of the estimation are summa-
rized in the Table I. It can be seen from the table that
the method allows one to estimate correct order of the
absolute values of the nonlinear coupling parameter. For
some parameter the accuracy of the estimation is much

better, but in practice the correct values are not know.
Therefore we conclude that the accuracy of the estima-
tion of the absolute values of parameters of coupling of
two limit cycle systems from univariate time-series data
is within the order of magnitude.

Similar results are obtained for the estimation of other
parameters of the model. Using values of the model pa-
rameters estimated from the univariate surrogate data
one can reconstruct very closely the dynamical and spec-
tral features of the original system as shown in the Fig.
6. The largest errors of estimations are obtained for
the values of the noise intensity as shown in two last
columns of the Table 6. This result can be easily under-
stood taking into account that ﬁltration of the signals has
the strongest eﬀect on the noise spectrum of the system.
However, the ﬁlter-induced errors are systematic and can
be corrected using test with surrogate data.

The main source of error is related to the spectral de-

composition of the univariate data and it is therefore sys-
tematic. To illustrate this point we use the original sur-
rogate time-series data {xr(t), xc(t), yr(t), yc(t)} for two
coupled oscillators to infer parameters of the model (1),
(2). The results of inference of the coupling parameters
are shown in the Tab. II. It can be seen that the values
of the parameters can be estimated with relative error
better then 10%. In particular, the relative error of es-
timation of the noise intensity is now better then 4%.
The accuracy of the estimation can be further improved
by increasing the total time of observation of the system
dynamics as explained in [34].

compared with semi-
quantitative estimations of either relative strength of
some of the nonlinear terms [26] or the directionality
of coupling [27, 28] from bivariate time-series data.
It
becomes clear that our algorithm provides an alterna-
tive eﬀective approach to the solution of the problem of
analysis of cardiovascular coupling. In particular, the re-
sults of this section validate the application of the method
to the experimental time-series cardiovascular data and
demonstrate that the it is indeed possible to estimate si-
multaneously the strength, directionality and the noise of
nonlinear cardiorespiratory coupling form the univariate
blood pressure signal. The accuracy of the estimation is
within the order of the magnitude. The main source of
errors is the decomposition of the univariate signal into

8

two oscillatory components and it is, therefore, system-
atic. Using this fact one can introduce systematic cor-
rections to improve the results of the estimation of the
parameters of the CR interaction from the experimen-
tally measured BP signal.

VI. DISCUSSION

It is important to establish a relationship between the
model parameters and physiological parameters of the
cardiovascular system. A beat-to-beat model describing
the relationships between blood pressures and respiration
in simple, but physiologically meaningful terms is the De-
Boer model [48, 59]. While the DeBoer model cannot de-
scribe the dynamics within one heartbeat it does incorpo-
rate several well-known physiological laws of the cardio-
respiratory system. More recent extensions and modiﬁ-
cations of the DeBoer model have appeared [10, 11, 23].
The problem of inverse modelling was not addressed in
this earlier work. It is therefore very desirable to con-
nect the approach presented here with such beat-to-beat
models.

The DeBoer model describes the beat-to-beat evolu-
tion of the state variables shown in the Fig. 7 (a): sys-
tolic pressure (S), diastolic pressure (D), RR intervals
(I), and arterial decay time (T = R × C = peripheral
resistance × arterial compliance). Following a brief ac-
count of the DeBoer model given in [17] and neglecting
for the sake of simplicity the variation of the peripheral
resistance we can write a set of corresponding diﬀerence
equations in the form

Di = Si−1 exp[(−2/3)Ii−1/T ],
Si = Di + γIi−1 + C1 + A sin(2πf t),

i−τv + GβF (S
Ii = GvS

Here C1, C2, and C3 are constants and the sigmoidal
nature of the baroreceptor sensitivity is accounted for by
deﬁning an eﬀective Systolic pressure (S′) [48]

i = S0 + 18 arctan[(S − S0)/18].

The ﬁrst equation (19) follows from the Windkessel
model of the circulation, while the second equation (20)
expresses contractile properties of the myocardium in ac-
cordance with Starling’s law that takes into account me-
chanical eﬀect of the circulation on the BP (see [48] and
e.g. [63]). The last equation (21) includes explicitly two
mechanisms of the cardiovascular control deﬁned by their
respective gain (G) and delay (τ ): (i) fast vagal control of
the heart rate GvS′
i−τv , (ii) slower β-sympathetic control
of the heart rate GβF (S′, τβ). Here F (S′, τ ) is a linear

Further we assume for simplicity that the pressure oscil-
lations do not deviate far away from the working point
S0 in (22), i.e. S′ ≈ S.

To establish the connection between DeBoer (19) - (21)
model and the model (1), (2) introduced in this paper
we note that the equations DeBoer model is a piece-wise
approximation of the actual BP signal. In particular, it
describes the BP signal as an exponential decay during
2/3 part of the RR interval and linear increase during
1/3 of the In as show in the Fig. 7 (b). We note also
that the model of the cardiac oscillations (2) resembles a
model of the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) system

˙x = ǫ(y − βx),
˙y = αy + γy2 + δy3 − x + C,

(23)

(cid:26)

where we have neglected for a moment the cardiorespira-
tory interaction. The approximation of the BP signal by
the output of the FHN system is also shown in the Fig.

γ = 1, δ = −1.

7 (b). It can be seen already from a comparison between
two approximations that there is a close connections be-
tween DeBoer model and model of coupled oscillators
considered in this paper. This can be further illustrated
by noticing that for small ǫ the limit cycle in the FHN
system consists of fast motion with practically constant
values of y, when x jumps between negative and positive
values, and slow motion, when x changes very little (see
Fig. 8). Assuming the constant value of x at the top |a+|
and at the bottom −|a−| of the dashed curve that cor-
respond to the slow motion along the limit cycle we can
integrate the ﬁrst equation in (23) to obtain

x0(t) =

This solution closely resembles eqs. (19) and (20) of the
DeBoer model

It can be seen even from this simpliﬁed discussion that
the parameters of the model (1), (2) found in the present
paper can be related directly to the physiological param-
eters of the autonomous control of circulation. Further-
more, this discussion suggests that it should be possible
at least in principle to bridge inverse and forward mod-
elling and to infer parameters of the autonomous ner-
vous control of the cardiovascular system directly from
the time-series data.

We emphasize, however, that the obtained results is
In particular, the
only the ﬁrst step in this direction.
DeBoer model itself has to be modiﬁed in various ways,
including more realistic functional form of the feedback
terms and speciﬁcally taking into account the fact that
the baroreﬂex control is a closed loop [18, 21]. In fact
it was shown [70] that a multi-compartment closed-loop
model of the cardiovascular responses can simulate well
the experimentally observed variations in the time-series.
On the other hand, this comparison suggests that the in-
ference scheme used in this paper has to be modiﬁed in

a various ways to facilitate convergence and guarantee
deeper physiological meaning of the model parameters
as will be discussed in more details elsewhere. It is also
important to emphasize that dynamical inference of more
sophisticated multi-dimensional models of the type [70]
can be addressed only in the frame of full Bayesian infer-
ence of hidden dynamical variables.

VII. CONCLUSION

In the present paper we have introduced a technique for
nonlinear dynamical inference of cardiovascular interac-
tions from blood pressure time-series data. The method
is applied to the simultaneous estimation of the dynami-
cal couplings and noise strengths in a model of the nonlin-
ear cardio-respiratory interaction. We have identiﬁed a

10

simple nonlinear stochastic dynamical model of the car-
diorespiratory interaction that describes, in framework
of inverse modelling, the time-series data in a particu-
lar frequency band. The method was validated using
surrogate data obtained by numerically integrating the
inferred model itself. We showed that main source of
errors in the method is the decomposition of the blood
pressure signal into two oscillatory components. We il-
lustrate in the discussion that the dynamical model of
the cardiorespiratory interaction identiﬁed in the present
research can be related to the well-know beat-to-beat
model of the cardiovascular control introduced by De-
Boer and co-workers [59]. The method introduced in
this paper can be used to infer parameters of stochastic
nonlinear dynamical models from observed phenomena
across many scientiﬁc disciplines.

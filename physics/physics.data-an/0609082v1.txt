Abstract

We suggest a class of direct sample estimates for the two-point quadratic statistical functions

of multidimensional data, which includes: estimates of the sample autocovariance function (AcF),

sample mean square increment (also, structure) function, and the estimate of the power spectrum.

The central estimate for the class is the sample AcF, which is constructed as to represent the ﬁnite

Fourier transform of the periodogram estimate of the spectrum and is positive semideﬁnite. The

estimate explicitly account for the anisotropy of the ﬁelds in all spatial directions and is illustrated

on two examples: the morphology of the Grab nebula and the surface roughness generated as a

solution of the anisotropic Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation. We also provide an expression of the

covariance of the sample AcF in the case of data assumed to be drawn from a two-dimensional

Gaussian ﬁeld with a known mean.

INTRODUCTION

Despite the increased availability of multidimensional data, it appears that not much

attention has been devoted to the problem of adequate and accurate direct estimation of

simple quantities such as two-point, quadratic statistical functions. The latter include au-

tocovariance (AcF) and autocorrelation functions, and the mean square increment (also

structure) function. Among the monographs we are aware of, a good exception is [1], where

an estimate of the two-dimensional AcF is discussed in some detail. Speciﬁcally, for a given

function is estimated in volume 2, chapter 9 of [1] by

N2 matrix of real data fx1x2, x1 = 1, 2, . . . N1, x2 = 1, 2, . . . N2, the autocovariance

mally, the latter replaces u1 and u2 in (1) by their absolute values. Note that this leaves

A∗(~u) undeﬁned in the second and the fourth quadrants. We shall call this estimate “the

standard” 2d sample autocovariance function (SAcF) estimate.

For a homogeneous (stationary) random 2d ﬁeld, f (~x), the spectral representation theo-

rem asserts that its AcF and spectral density function (or simply the spectrum) are related

by the Fourier transform,

The standard estimate, A∗, satisﬁes (5), in the domains where it is deﬁned. However, it is

easy to see that if the validity of (1) is extended to the second and the fourth quadrants,

Eq. (5) does not hold. The latter follows also from the developments presented in the next

Another property of the theoretical AcF that must be shared by an estimate is the

property of positive semideﬁniteness. Let ax1,x2 be an arbitrary non-zero (N1 ×

It easy to see that A∗ does not satisfy (6) in the second and the fourth quadrants. We stress

that the inequality (6) does not bear theoretical importance only; it ensures the positiveness

of spectral estimates based on an AcF estimate (indirect estimates) [2], see also Eq. (9)

section.

below.

In this paper we obtain a 2d AcF direct estimate, denoted hereinafter by A(~u), which

satisﬁes (5) in all four quadrants, see the next section – Eq. (8). The estimate is identical to

A∗(~u) in the ﬁrst and the third quadrants but diﬀers in the second and the fourth quadrants.

The estimate A(~u) is positive semideﬁnite and leads to new estimates of both the mean

square increment (structure) function and the power spectrum. We brieﬂy discuss these

estimates also in the second section and provide generalization of (8) for arbitrary dimension.

One of the most important advantages of the new estimate lays in the fact that it is ca-

pable to capture the anisotropy of the data in arbitrary spatial direction. The latter dictates

the choice of the illustrations and applications we consider here; yet another application —

a study of an YBCO thin ﬁlm morphology using (8) — can be found in [3]. In the ﬁrst

of the two applications, we study the AcF of images representing the morphology of the

Crab nebula. The random ﬁeld for these images is the light intensity in a recorded pixel.

The anisotropy in this case is determined either by the direction of the expansion of the

supernova ejecta or by the interaction of synchrotron nebula with the ejecta [4, 5].

3

In the third section we compute the covariance of A(~u) for dimension d = 2 and under

the simplifying assumptions that the observations are drawn from a Gaussian random ﬁeld

and are already adjusted to have zero mean. Our second application involves the anisotropic

Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (AKPZ) equation [6, 7, 8], considered in section four in somewhat more

detail. The equation pertains to growth of vicinal surfaces and the anisotropy arises from

the diﬀerent rates of growth along and across the average steps direction [6]. We study

how this anisotropy imprints on the shape of the AcF by numerically solving the AKPZ

equation on a large lattice and then taking a smaller size images rotated on various angles

with respect to the axis of anisotropy. A summary of our results and main conclusions are

presented in the last section.

II. SAMPLE ESTIMATES OF THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL ACF

In order to obtain a direct estimate of the 2d sample AcF that corresponds to I(~k),

we simply need to rearrange (4) to a 2d discrete Fourier transform. We begin by chang-
ing y1 = x1 −
the sums with respect to x1, y1 to two double sums:

u1 and reversing the order of x1 and u1 summation. This breaks up

In analogous manner we deal with the x2, and y2 summations obtaining four terms, which

then can be combined into two pairs arriving at the following 2d discrete Fourier represen-

which represents the new estimate of the sample AcF in dimension two. It diﬀers from the

standard estimate (1) in the second and fourth quadrants only. We stress that by the virtue

of its construction, it is (8) but not the standard estimate that is related to the periodogram

by (7).

A diﬀerent way to obtain A(~u) is to substitute I(~k) directly in Eq. (5) and perform the
integration with respect to ~k. Then to use the obtained pair of Kronecker symbols to carry

out two of the summations carefully accounting for the limits of summation. The latter

depends on the position of ~u, which produces (8).

The estimate A(~u) is positive semideﬁnite function. This follows from the way it was

obtained but it is instructive to show that the positive semideﬁniteness virtually forces the

form of the SAcF, Eq. (8). To demonstrate this we use a 2d generalization of a proof of

semideﬁniteness due to McLeod and Jim´enez, see [2], chapter 6. Let εx1,x2 be a 2d white noise
ˆfk,lεx1−k,x2−l; here
with zero mean and variance 1/N1N2. Form a the ﬁeld gx1,x2 =
the centered values of the sample, ˆfk,l, are considered as coeﬃcients of a moving average-

like 2d ﬁeld. Since gx1,x2 is stationary, its theoretical AcF must be positive semideﬁnite.

A straightforward calculation shows that this function is given by (8). One last remark

regarding (8):

it easy to see that the estimate A(~u) can be computed numerically using

the FFT-based algorithm and the codes given in [9], chapters 12 and 13; however, by ﬁrst
extending the data twice in both dimensions and assuming that fx1,x2 ≡
0 if either N1 ≤
x1 ≤

2N1, or N2 ≤

Estimate (8) can be used as a basis for estimates of both sample power spectrum and

sample mean square increment function. One can obtain an estimate of the spectrum from

(8) by employing it in a 2d generalization of Grenander and Rosenblatt formula [10],

S(~k) =

where the function w(~u) is termed “lag window”. The general properties and speciﬁc exam-

ples of w(~u) can be found in [1]; we note here that obviously it must be an even function

w(

~u) = w(~u). The statistics of this estimate will be presented elsewhere, note however that

−

as in the 1d case, (5) provides a smoothed compared to the “raw” periodogram estimate.

The mean square increment (structure) function of f (~x),

(~u), is deﬁned [11, 12] by

, where E denotes the ensemble averaging, and is related

standard estimate of

in the second and the fourth quadrants as:

u2 < 0.

(10)

(cid:1)

In addition of being a positive function, we remark that B(~u) does not involve the sample

mean of f (~x) and thus is free from a source of bias brought up by f [2, 16]. Modiﬁcations

analogous to (10) are apparently due for the estimates of the generalized structure functions

used to infer multifractal scaling, see Refs. [17, 18].

Estimate (8) can readily be generalized to arbitrary dimension d. To shorten the nota-

tions, consider a multi-index with d components p = (p1, p1, . . . pd) each taking a value of

either 0 or 1. Let pk = 0 indicates xk, whereas pk = 1 indicates xk +

, k = 1, 2, . . . d, and

let p designate the multi-index whose components are all diﬀerent from the components of p;

e.g. if p = (011), then p = (100). Then the d-dimensional SAcF estimate can be expressed

In general, the

To illustrate the diﬀerence between the standard and the estimate (8), we provide plots

of both estimates for pair of images representing regions of the Crab nebula. The images

were selected from a color image taken from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) [19]. The

color image was created as a weighted sum of three narrowband ﬁlters centered at 5012
˚A, 6306 ˚A and 6732 ˚A and comprises 24 individual Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2

exposures [4]. We converted the color image into gray scale (in the range of 0-256) image,

i.e. fx,y in this case is proportional to the light intensity per pixel and represents the

morphology of the nebula; we added a circle indicating the position of the Crab pulsar.

The ﬁrst of the selected images, shown in Fig. 1(b) top panel, is located close to outer

rim of the nebula dominated by the expanding ejecta [4, 5]. The coordinates of its right

bottom corner are, RA: α2000 =5:34:40.5 and Dec: δ2000 =21:59:39.1. The image extends

(46.2

49.7) arcseconds corresponding to (N1 = 453)

(N2 = 487) pixels. By just inspecting

×

×

the image the anisotropy is not easily recognizable, however, due to the outward expansion

of the supernova remnant an anisotropy roughly across the radial direction (direction to the

pulsar) should present in the morphology.

The second image has coordinates: α2000 =5:34:29.0, δ2000 = 21:59:10.0 and extends

51.8

51.8 arcseconds, (504

504) pixels — Fig. 1(b), bottom panel. It is from a region

×

×

where the synchrotron nebula (upper left sector of the image) interacts with the denser

ejecta creating “ﬁlaments”. The latter are attributed to a magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T)

instabilities [4]. The major axis of anisotropy in this region should, in general, be expected

along rather then across the direction to the pulsar.

An overall linear (planar) trend, g = sαα + sδδ with origins of coordinate systems at the

left-upper corners of the images, is removed before both SAcF estimates were computed.

Carrying out this procedure is important since the trend by itself produces anisotropy in

the SAcF. In the case of images presented in Fig. 1(b) the linear trend is rather small;

the estimated slopes (in units grayscale/pixel) are sDEC =

0.027, sRA = 0.0071, and

−

sDEC = 0.101, sRA = 0.031, for ﬁrst and second images, respectively. The standard and the

estimate (8) for the ﬁrst image are presented as gray scale plots with superimposed level

contours in Fig. 1(c) and Fig. 1(d), respectively. For the sake of completeness of the plot the

standard AcF is extended to the second and the fourth quadrants, hence the speciﬁc “rose”

appearance of the AcF. The anisotropy of the supernova remnant structures in this part

of the nebula is clearly recognized from the plot of A(~u) with the major axis of anisotropy

having an angle of about ϑ

25◦ with respect to the horizontal axis. This angle should be

≈ −

interpreted as the average front of the local expansion, refer to Fig. 1(a). Another quantity

that characterizes the anisotropy is the aspect ratio, γ, the ratio between the characteristic

sizes of the nebula structures along the minor and majors axes of anisotropy. The latter

sizes are deﬁned by the correlation lengths of SAcF in the respective directions. We evaluate

are represented by random processes with ﬁnite domain (band-limited) spectra. Using the

expressions for the correlation length obtained for this class of random processes in [20, 21],

we infer γ

respect to the horizontal axis, which as should be expected is roughly in direction to the

pulsar, refer to Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(f). The aspect ratio in this case is γ

III. COVARIANCES OF THE 2D SAMPLE AUTOCOVARIANCE FUNCTION

In this section we obtain expression for covariances of 2d SAcF — the estimate (8),

evaluated at two points ~u = (u1, u2) and ~v = (v1, v2):

IV. APPLICATION TO THE ANISOTROPIC KPZ EQUATION

The anisotropic Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (AKPZ) equation has been introduced in an at-

tempt to model the growth on a vicinal substrates [6]. Adatoms that migrate towards the

steps and attach to them, have lower probability to desorb compared to those migrating

parallel to the steps. This eﬀectively induces diﬀerent rates of growth along and across the

steps and violates the rotational symmetry of the KPZ growth process [22]. Let h = h(~x, t)

be the height of the growing surface at point ~x = (x, y) and time t.

If one chooses the

x-coordinate along the direction of the steps, the AKPZ equation takes the form:

∂th = νx∂2

xh + νy∂2

y h +

(∂xh)2 +

(∂yh)2 + η,

(19)

see also [8]. In this equation: νx and νy are coeﬃcients of the curvature terms associated

with desorption, λx and λy are coeﬃcients related to growth rates normal the surface, and

η = η(x, y, t) is a Gaussian white noise, E[η(x, y, t)η(x′, y′, t′)] = 2Dδ(x

The equation has been studied by D. E. Wolf using one-loop, renormalization-group (RG)

approximation [7]. Some of the obtained results have later been conﬁrmed by numerical

simulations [23]. To recap what will be needed here, let rν = νy/νx and rλ = λy/λx and let

both λx and λy be positive. In this case the AKPZ surface grows with an exponent identical

to the surface generated by the isotropic KPZ equation, referred to as algebraic roughness.

As the morphology evolves, the nonlinear parameters λx and λy, as in the case of isotropic

KPZ are not renormalized, whereas νx and νy take eﬀective values such that rν = rλ (a ﬁxed

point to the dynamical renormalization ﬂow equations) [7]. This means that in this case the

anisotropy of the surface is of the simplest kind – elliptical anisotropy – and therefore might

be taken as a benchmark for testing statistical methods characterizing anisotropy.

The numerical simulations were carried out using the Amar and Family numerical

scheme [24, 25, 26], which broadly speaking includes rescaling of the equation and em-

ploying the standard discretization for the derivatives. Two comments are in order. First,

in contrast to [23], we choose rescaling that leaves the equation manifestly anisotropic:

x

7→

√νxx, y

√νxy, h

(2νx/λx)h, and η

2D/νxη. Second, the discrete analog

7→

does not adequately represent the continuous AKPZ equation [27], however, since more ac-

p

curate diﬀerence scheme are not known for dimensions higher than one [28, 29], we employ

here the standard discretization. What is more important within the scope of this study,

12

surface. The conditions at which the simulation is carried out are discussed in the text.

the discrete equation inherits the elliptical anisotropy of the original AKPZ equation.

The elliptical anisotropy can be discerned even by visually inspecting of the simulated

morphology, see Fig. 3. The picture represents AKPZ surface generated with parameters

νx = 1, νy = 0.3, λx = 10, λy = 3, and D = 0.2; (to skip the “transient” time for the system

to come to the RG ﬁxed point, we have chosen rν = rλ = 0.3 at the outset). The simulation

is carried out on a square lattice with side of L = 1024 and for T = 2

105 time steps of

×

∆t = 0.001. The surface height range is given in units of lattice spacing set to unity.

In a typical experimental circumstances, the axes of anisotropy are rarely known and

need to be inferred and quantiﬁed from a image of the morphology [15]. To reckon with

this we “record” smaller, (512

512), images, which are rotated at angles ψ0 = 0◦, 10◦,
30◦, and 60◦ with respect to the x-axis of the simulated surface. The picture in Fig. 3
represents the image for ψ0 = 0◦. The images for ψ0 6

= 0◦ are obtained using a simple,

based on the four nearest neighbor points interpolation. Then for every image we compute

the AcF estimate (8), an example of which for ψ0 = 30◦ is shown in Fig. 4. Taking a more

systematic approach, rather than the correlation length, we consider sections of AcF deﬁned

by aA(0)

A(~u)

(a+∆a)A(0) for several levels 0 < a < 1 and a ﬁxed width of ∆a = 0.04.

We project the values of A(~u) within each section on the (u1, u2) plane and ﬁt these points

by an ellipse. The direction of the axis of asymmetry and the aspect ratio is evaluated from

the parameters of these ellipses. In the actual ﬁts we have used four levels of a: 0.2, 0.4,

0.6, and 0.8.

The obtained results show a discrepancy typically within

2◦ from the expected direction

±

of the anisotropy. In few cases only, all associated with the lowest level of a, the discrepancy

is up to

4◦. More interesting are the inferred values of the aspect ratio. These are plotted in

±

Fig. 5 for all four angles of rotation and AcF levels a and for two simulated surfaces, studied

independently. The parameters of the ﬁrst simulation are the same as those used to produce

are also the same, however, with: νx = 1, νy = 0.15, λx = 10, λx = 1.4, and D = 0.2

(rν = rλ = 0.15). The values of γ for the ﬁrst simulation are grouped around 0.548, upper

part of the ﬁgure, whereas for the second — around 0.387 bottom part of the ﬁgure. Both

these values correspond to the respective √rν values used in the simulations. To understand

surface in this case is obtained by just rescaling the isotropic surface in x and y directions

by lx = √νx and ly = √νy, respectively. The latter leads to aspect ratio of γ = √rν,

which as demonstrated in Fig. 5 is imprinted in the sample AcF, Eq. (8). A somewhat

larger discrepancy from √rν observed at the lowest level ﬁts can be attributed to a greater

relative variability of the SAcF. The latter can be estimated crudely from the variance

(18) by substituting the SAcF for the unknown true AcF. For the two simulations used in

Fig. 5, we obtain an increase from 12% at ~u = 0, up to about 23% for points ~u at which

= 0 the surfaces in this class are characterized by two characteristic

In addition, the characteristic length scale linearly, ly ∼
approach undertaken in this section may be suitable for characterization of more generic

lx, Ref. [7]. This suggests that the

AKPZ morphologies. Further numerical simulations, however, are needed to conﬁrm this

assertion.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have suggested an estimate for the autocovariance function (AcF) of a

homogenous random ﬁeld in arbitrary dimension d. The estimate, Eq. (11), is constructed

as to represent the discrete and ﬁnite Fourier transform of the periodogram estimate of the

ﬁeld’s power spectrum; it is identical to the standard AcF estimate in the ﬁrst and the

2d−1 + 1-th quadrants but diﬀers in all other quadrants. As it should be, the estimate is

positive semideﬁnite. On the basis of (11), we have suggested new estimates for the ﬁeld’s

structure function and power spectrum. We have also derived expressions for the covariance,

consequently for the variance of the AcF estimate in two dimensions under the simplifying

assumption that the ﬁeld is Gaussian and with a known mean.

Perhaps the most important advantage of the new sample AcF over the standard estimate

lays in the fact that it captures the anisotropy of the ﬁeld in all spatial directions. The latter

is demonstrated on two examples. The ﬁrst involves the morphology of the Grab nebula

observed by the Hubble space telescope. For sake of comparison we presented plots of

the standard AcF as well. The second example involves surfaces simulated by numerically

solving the anisotropic Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (AKPZ) equation and is considered in more

16

detail. In particular, we have focused on the case νy/νx = λy/λx, i.e. when the system is at

a ﬁxed point of the dynamic renormalization group approximation for the AKPZ equation.

In this case the characteristic lengths of the morphology are two and are determined by

lx = √νx and ly = √νy. Hence, the surface can be viewed as a simple benchmark for testing

statistical methods that account for anisotropy. We have shown that one can retrieve both

the direction and the aspect ratio of the anisotropy reasonably well from the estimate (11) in

two dimensions. This has been done on several sections of the AcF and on two independent

realizations.

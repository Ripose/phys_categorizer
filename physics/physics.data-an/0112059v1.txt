Using quantum theory methods we discuss the general reversible reactions
A1 + A2 +
+ Bs, where r and s are arbitrary natural
positive numbers, and show that if either direction of the reaction is repeated
a large number of times N , in a ﬁnite total time T , then in the limit of very
large N , keeping T constant, one remains with the initial reacting particles of
the repeated direction only. We also show that if the reaction evolves through
diﬀerent possible paths of evolution, each of them beginning at the same side
of the reaction, proceeds through intermediate consecutive diﬀerent reactions
and end at the other side, then one may realize any such path by performing a
large number of repetitions of the reactions along it. We propose a numerical
model to prove this for the speciﬁc reversible reaction A + B

A + C.

B1+B2+

The general reversible reactions A1+A2+
+Bs, where r and s are two
+Ar
arbitrary positive natural numbers, have been studied by many authors (see, for example, [1]
and references therein). These studies discuss, especially, the eﬀects of the single reactions,
or, in case they are repeated N times, the eﬀect of these repetitions where the general total
time increases proportionally to N. We can, however, imagine a situation in which the rate
of these repetitions increases and discuss the eﬀect of this increase upon the reaction. Such
an eﬀect has been studied in [2] with respect to random walk and it was shown that when
the rate of repeating the random walk becomes very large one obtains a Brownian motion. It
has also been shown [3] with respect to a one-dimensional array of imperfect traps [1,4] that
as their number along the same ﬁnite interval, becomes very large, the survival probability
[1] of the particles that pass through them tends to unity. We show in this work that if either
direction of the reaction is repeated a large number of times N in a ﬁnite total time T , then in
the limit of very large N, keeping T constant, one remains with the initial reacting particles
of the repeated direction only. We use quantum theory methods and terminology [5]. We
note that many authors use quantum formalism for analysing classical reactions (see for
example [6] and annotated bibligraphy therein). The most suitable method is the coherent
state one [7,8] since it allows us to deﬁne simultaneously, and thus to bypass the Heizenberg
uncertainty principle [5], the expectation values of the coherent state conjugate variables Q
and P , so that they both may have nonzero values. Thus, this formalism resembles [9] the
classical one and it is appropriate to use it for discussing classical reactions. Also, the use
of the coherent states formalism, together with second quantization methods, for classical
systems has been studied by Masao [10].

In this context we assume that we have some ensemble consisting of N particles so that
, N) is deﬁned as a
the conﬁguration in which the ith particle is located at qi (i = 1, 2,
qN >). Thus, when
state of the system and denoted, in Dirac’s notation [5],
representing, in the following, classical particles by states we mean that they are elements
of some conﬁguration of the whole ensemble. Following this terminology we may calculate
the probability to ﬁnd the ensemble of particles in some deﬁnite state

B and A1 + A2 ↔

In Section 2 we discuss the special cases of r = s = 1 and r = s = 2, that is, the reversible
reactions A
B1 + B2, and show that repeating either direction of each
one a large number N of times in a ﬁnite total time T results, in the limit of very large
N, in remaining with the initial reacting particles only. The generalization to any ﬁnite
r and s follows. We note that since we discuss the probability to remain with the initial
reacting particles the product particles of such reactions are not relevant to our discussion.
In Section 3 we discuss the more general and natural case in which the product particles
are relevant. That is, we assume that the particles of the ensemble interact at diﬀerent
places and diﬀerent times and we calculate the probability that, given some diﬀerent initial
and ﬁnal reactions a speciﬁed system of reacting particles evolves along a prescribed path,
from a large number of diﬀerent ones that all begin at the given initial reaction, end at the
ﬁnal one and are composed of intermediate consecutive diﬀerent reactions. We note that
such paths of “states” for the diﬀusion controlled reactions has been discussed in [10–12] in
which use has been made of quantum ﬁeld theory methods [13,14], including Wick’s theorem
[13,14], to derive the classical Feynman diagrams [15]. These methods were also used in [11]
for chemical kinetics. We show that taking the limit of very large number N of repetitions
of the reactions along the prescribed path one obtains a unity value for the probability
of evolution along that path. In Section 4 we numerically simulate the reversible reaction
A+B
A+C by the model of two dimensional concentric billiard in which the two possible
modes of reﬂections, either between the two concentric circles or between points of the outer
circle, represent the two directions of the reaction. We note that nuclear and radioactive
reactions are well simulated by billiards in which the stationary scattering circles represent
the interactions between particles (see, for example, [16] in which a model of a rectangular
billiard with a circle inside was used to discuss the decay law of classical systems). We show
that if either direction of the reaction is repeated a large number of times N in a ﬁnite
total time then in the limit of very large N the result obtained is the natural one, as will
be explained later, in which no repetition is involved. That is, the very large number of
repeating the same direction of the reaction, where the second occurs at some preﬁxed lower
rate, has an eﬀect as if the high rate repeated reaction did not occur. This is exactly what
we obtain analytically from Sections 2 and 3 in which the large number of repetitions of
either direction of the general reversible reaction A1 + A2 +
+ Bs
results in remaining, with a unity probability, with the initial reacting particles only as if
the repeated reaction did not happen at all.

We discuss ﬁrst the speciﬁc case of r = s = 1 and note, as we have remarked, that since
we calculate the probability to remain with the initial reacting particles the product part of
the reaction is not essential to the following discussion as will be shown. Nevertheless, we
take in this section the speciﬁc examples of r = s = 1 and r = s = 2 and begin with the
ﬁrst reaction, that is, A

III. THE PROBABILITY TO FIND GIVEN FINAL CONFIGURATION THAT
MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM THE INITIAL ONE

We, now, discuss the more general and natural case in which we calculate the probability to
ﬁnd at the time t a subsystem of the ensemble at some given conﬁguration if at the initial
time t0 it was at another. We assume that the concerned time (t
t0) is not inﬁnitesimal and
that during it the subsystem has undergones a series of reactions that begin at the initial
time t0 and end at the time t. The passage from some reaction at some intermediate time
ti to the neighbouring one at the time (ti + δt) is governed by the coherence between the
corresponding resulting conﬁgurations of the subsystem at these times. Thus, restricting,
for the moment, our attention to the case in which a particle in the subsystem that was at
the time t0 at the state A and at the time (t0 + δt) at B we can write the relevant coherence
[8] between these two states as

−

τ (A, B; t0A, (t0 + δt)B) =< qAt0 , pAt0 |

qBt0+δt, pBt0+δt >,

(15)

|

|

qAt0 , pAt0 > and

qBt0+δt, pBt0+δt > are the coherent states that represent the particles
where
A and B at the times t0 and t0 + δt respectively (see Eqs (3),(4)) and the angular brackets
denote an ensemble average over all the particles of it. We note that if A = B, τ measures
[8] the autocorrelation of either the particle A or B, and when A
= B τ is the crosscorelation
[8] of the two particles. It can be shown, using Eqs (1) and (15) that the following relation

τ (A, B; t0A, (t0 + δt)B)

2 = τ (A, A; t0A, t0A)τ (B, B; (t0 + δt)B, (t0 + δt)B),

(16)

|

|

is valid. That is, the modulus of the crosscorrelation of the particles A and B at the times
t0 and t0 + δt equals the product of the autocorrelation of the particle A at the time t0 by
that of B at the time t0 + δt. The last relation is interpreted [8] as the probability density
for the occurence of the reaction A
B at the time t0 + δt. That is, given that the system
was at “state” A at the time t0, the probability to ﬁnd it at the time t0 + δt at “state” B
is given by Eq (16). We can generalize to the joint probability density for the occurence of
n diﬀerent reactions between the initial and ﬁnal times t0 and t, where each involves two
diﬀerent particles and is of the kind Ai
Ai+1. That is, each reaction is composed of two
parts; the ﬁrst one is that in which a particle of the subsystem is observed at the time ti
to be at state Ai, and the second that in which it is observed at the time ti + δt to be at
the state Ai+1. Thus, the total time interval t
t0 is partitioned into 2n subintervals during
which the n reactions occur and the total coherence is

at the previous section, for either direction of the reversible reaction A
probability to remain with the initial particle A (or B) tends to unity in the limit of a very
large number of repetitions of it. That is, in this limit each factor of the last product in Eq
Ai+1, tends to unity and with it the
(17), which is the probability for the reaction Ai
joint probability for the occurence of the n reactions so that the speciﬁc prescribed path of
reactions is followed through all of them with a probability of unity.

product of Eq (18), and with it the whole expression, tends to unity. If any particle A of
the subsystem does not react with any other particle at some of the 2n intermediate times
then we may denote its no-reaction at these times as A
A and the probability for it to
remain in the initial state (which is the same as the ﬁnal one) is obviously unity.

→

Thus, we see that we may realize any deﬁnite path of reactions, from a large number of
possible ones that all begin at the same given reaction and end at another, by repeating a
large number of times all the reactions that compose this path.

IV. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS OF THE REVERSIBLE REACTION

A + B

A + C

↔

↔

We, now, numerically simulate the reversible reaction A+ B
A+ C. The model we use for
this simulation is the two-dimensional circular billiard which is composed of two concentric
circles. We have initialy a large ensemble of identical point particles each of them is the
component A of the reaction. All of these particles are entered, one at a time, into the
billiard in which they are elastically reﬂected by the two concentric circles. That is, the
angles before and after each reﬂection are equal. We assume that on the outer circle there
is a narrow hole through which the particles A leave the billiard. Once a particle is ejected
out a new one is entered and reﬂected inside the billiard untill it leaves and so for all the
particles of the ensemble. There are two diﬀerent possible motions for each point particle A
before leaving the billiard; either it is reﬂected between the two cocentric circles or, when
the angle of reﬂection is large, reﬂected by the outer circle only without touching the inner
one. Now, since the reﬂections are elastic each particle A once it begins in either kind of
motion it continues in it as long as it moves undisturbed inside the billiard untill it leaves
through the narrow opening. The component B of the reaction denotes the outer larger
circle, and the component C denotes both circles. That is, the left hand side A + B of the
reaction signiﬁes that the point particle A moves inside the billiard and is reﬂected by the
outer circle only, whereas, the right hand side of it A + C denotes the second kind of motion
in which the point balls A are reﬂected between the two circles. We call these two kinds
of paths “states”, so that the path that touchs both circles is “state” 1 and the one that
thouchs the outer circle only is “state” 2.

Since in such a system we can not follow the path of each particle and can not diﬀerentiate
between the two kinds of motion we have to consider, as done for the nuclear and radioactive
processes [16], the activities of these particles in either path. That is, the rate at which the
entire ensemble of particles, being at either state, leaves the billiard. We assume for the
activity discussed here, as is assumed [16] for the nuclear and radioactive’s activities, that
each particle A enjoys arbitrary initial conditions, so in the following numerical simulations
we assume that it may begins its journey inside the billiard at either “state” which is
determined randomely using a random number generator. As remarked, we want to show
numerically that if either side of this reversible reaction A + B
A + C is repeated a large
number of times N in a ﬁnite total time T , then in the limit of very large N the activity
obtained is the same as the natural activity that results when no such repetitions has been
done. For that matter, we take into account that the reversible reactions that naturally
occur in nature have equal or diﬀerent rates for the two directions of the reactions and
that the total activity of such ensemble in which these reactions happen depend critically

↔

9

upon these rates as will be shown. If, for example, we consider the equal rate case then
we have to discuss the rate of evacuation of the billiard when each particle is allowed, after
preﬁxed number of reﬂections in either state, to pass, if it is still in billiard, to the other
one. This activity is shown by the solid curve in Figure 1 in which the ordinate axis denotes
the number of particles A that leave the billiard in prescribed time intervals binned in units
of 60 [16]. We assume [16] that each point particle A in either state moves with the same
speed of 3, and the hole through which they leave has a width of 0.15. We denote the outer
and inner radii of the billiard by r1 and r2 respectively, and we assign them the values of
r1 = 6 and r2 = 3. The initial number of the particles A was 106, and each one of them
passes from one “state” to the other, if it did not leave the billiard through the hole, after
every 1100 consecutive reﬂections. The natural activity is that when the entire ensemble of
106 particles A enter, one at a time, the billiard at the same deﬁnite “state” and remain
all the time in this “state” without passing to the other until they leave the billiard. The
dashed curve in Figure 1 shows this natural activity when all the particles A are in “state”
2 in which they are reﬂected only between points of the outer circle untill they leave the
billiard. The dashdot curve shows the activity when all the particles A are in “state” 1
in which they are reﬂected only between the two circles.
It has been found that for the
values assigned here to the radii of the outer and inner circles (6 and 3) the activity of
“state” 2 shown by the dashed curve is the maximum avilable and that of state 1 shown by
the dashdot curve is the minimum. The large diﬀerence between the two activities has its
source in the range of the allowed angles of reﬂections which is much larger in state 2 than
in state 1. This is because the minimum trajectory between two neighbouring reﬂections in
state 2, where the particles A are reﬂected between points of the outer circle only, may be
inﬁnitesimal compared to the corresponding trajectory in state 1 which is (we denote the
trajectories between neighbouring reﬂections in states 1 and 2 by d1 and d2 respectively)
r2. For the values assigned here to the radii r1 and r2 of the two concentric
d1min = r1 −
circles (r1 = 6 and r2 = 3) d1min = 3. We note that the maximum trajectory between two
neighbouring reﬂections in state 2 is equal to the corresponding one in state 1, that is

d1max = d2max = qr2

1 + r2
2

Thus, the particles A has much more possibilities to be reﬂected to the hole and leave the
billiard in state 2 than in state 1 and, accordingly, their activity is much larger. The solid
curve is, as remarked, the activity obtained when the particles A are transferred between
the two states at the rate of one passage for every 1100 reﬂections and so, as expected, it is
between the activities of them.

We, numerically, interfere with the rate of the systematic passage of the point particles
A between the two states such that this rate is accelerated. It is found that the activity of
the entire ensemble is directly (inversely) proportional to the rate of the passage from state
1 (2) to state 2 (1) when the opposite passage from state 2 (1) to state 1 (2) remains in the
rate of one for every 1100 reﬂections. Thus, we found that when the particles in state 1 (2)
are transferred to state 2 (1) at the maximum rate of one passage after each single reﬂection
and the particles in state 2 (1) are passed to the state 1 (2) at the remarked rate then the
activity of the particles A is maximal (minimal). But as we have remarked the maximal
(minimal) activity is obtained only when each particle of the entire ensemble is always in
state 2 (1). In other words, as we have remarked, a very large number of repetitions of the

A + B) of the reaction where the right (left)
left (right) direction A + B
direction A + C
A + C) of it occurs every 1100 reﬂections, yields a result
as if the high rate repeated side of the reaction never happened and the activity obtained is
the natural one in which no repetition is present. The dashed curve in Figure 2, which is the
same as the dashed one of Figure 1, shows the activity obtained when all the 106 particles
A of the ensemble are allowed to move only in state 2 until they leave the billiard. The solid
curve is the activity obtained when the reaction A + C
A + B is repeated after each single
reﬂection and the opposite one after every 1100 reﬂections. It is seen that these curves are
similar to each other. That is, as we have said and in accordance with the former sections,
a large number of repetitions of the reaction yields a result that characterizes the activity
obtained in the absence of such repetitions. This is seen, in a much more clear way, in Figure
3 for the other direction A + B
A + C of the reaction. The observed single graph of the
ﬁgure is actually composed of two curves; one solid and the other dashed. The solid curve
shows the activity obtained when the reaction A + B
A + C is repeated after each single
A + B after every 1100 reﬂections. The dashed
reﬂection and the opposite one A + C
curve, which is identical to the dashdot one from Figure 1, is the activity one obtains when
all the particles A of the ensemble are constrained to move only in state 1 until they leave
the billiard. Note that the two curves are almost the same except for the longer tale of the
dashed curve. From both Figures 2 and 3 we realize that the large number of repetitions of
either direction of the reversible reaction A + B
A + C has the eﬀect as if it has not been
performed at all and the actual activity obtained is that of the natural one.

We note that the numerically obtained results just described are valid only at the limit
of the largest number of repetitions of the reaction, that is, of numerically repeating it after
each single reﬂection. When, for example, we repeat any direction of the reaction after
every two consecutive reﬂections then the results obtained deviate markedly from those just
described and shown in Figures 2 and 3. Thus, in the limit of very large number N of
repeating any direction of the reaction we obtain the natural activity in which no repetition
is allowed. This is in accord with the analytical results obtained in Sections 2 and 3 in
which a very large number of repeating the same direction of the general reversible reaction
A1 + A2 +
+ Bs, where r, s are any two arbitrary natural positive
numbers, yields the results of remaining with a unity probability with the initial reacting
particles as if the high rate repeated reaction did not occur at all.

All the former simulations were done when the outer and inner circles radii were 6 and 3
respectively. We note that we obtain similar numerical results for all other assigned values
r2 provided we always have
of r1 and r2 up to the extreme limits of r1 >> r2 and r1 ≈
r1 > r2

We may explain these results along the same line of explanation used to interpret the
similar results obtained in the quantum regime. It has been established theoretically [17]
and experimentally [18] that taking some quantum system which may reduce to any of its
eigenstates [5] through performing some experiment on it, and repeat this experiment a large
number N of times in a ﬁnite total time T results, in the limit of very large N, keeping T
constant, in preserving the initial state of the system. This phenomenon is the Zeno eﬀect
[17]. The similar results obtained theoretically in Section 2 suggest that this eﬀect may be
eﬀective also in the classical reactions. That is, repeating them a large number of times, in
a ﬁnite total time, may results in remaining with the initial reacting particles only as if the

11

repeated reaction did not happen at all. Moreover, it has been shown [20,21] that if any
quantum system evolves in a number of diﬀerent possible paths of states, that all begin at
the same given initial state and end at another given common ﬁnal one, then it is possible to
realize any such path by making dense measurement (in a ﬁnite total time) along it. That
is, by repeating a large number of times in a ﬁnite total time each of the experiments that
reduce the system to the speciﬁc states that constitute the relevant path. Similar results
were obtained in Section 3, in which we show that the joint probability density for the
occurence of n special diﬀerent reactions between the initial and ﬁnal times t0 and t tends
to unity in the limit of a large number of repetitions of each such reaction. This is shown
also in the numerical simulations from which we realize that repeating a large number of
A + C has, in the limit of numerically
times any direction of the reversible reaction A + B
repeating it after each single reﬂection, the eﬀect as if it never happened and the activity
obtained is the natural one in which no repetition occur. That is, the very large number of
repetitions causes the resulting activity to be the same as if these repetitions never happened
as obtained in the Zeno eﬀect in which the system is preserved in the initial state in spite,
and because, of the very large number of measurements.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

B1 + B2 +

We have shown, using quantum theory methods in which particles are represented by state
functions and the product of them with their conjugates is interpreted as probability, that
if either direction of the general reaction A1 + A2 +
+ Bs, where r, s
are any two natural positive numbers, is repeated a large number of times N in a ﬁnite total
time then in the limit of a very large N one remains, with a unity probability, with the initial
particles of the repeated direction only. In this context we diﬀerentiate between the case in
which there were more than one initial reacting particle and the case in which there is only
one such particle. In the ﬁrst case the mentioned unity probability is obtained if at least
one of the initial reacting particles have zero values for its c numbers q and p that denote
its coherent state representation, whereas, in the second case this condition is not needed
for remaining, after a large number of repeating the reaction, with the initial particle only.
Moreover, it has been shown that any speciﬁc prescribed evolution (from a large number
of possible ones) through a sequence of reactions that compose it may be realized with
a unity probability by repeating each such reaction a very large number of times. This
eﬀect of accelerating the rate of the reaction has been simulated, for the reversible reaction
A + C, by the two-dimensional concentric billiard in which the two modes of
A + B
possible reﬂections represent the two sides of the reaction. It has been numerically shown
that repeating either side of the reaction a large number N of times and the other side were
repeated with a lower rate, yields a result, in the limit of very large N, as if the high rate
repeated reaction were not performed at all.

↔

The tending of the survival probability to unity in the limit of a large number of repeti-
tions of the noted reactions is reminiscent of the quantum Zeno eﬀect [17] which is thought
to be a quantum phenomenon, although one of the ﬁrst articles [19] that discuss it maintains
that it may hold also in classical and macroscopic phenomena. In this eﬀect the very large
number of repeating any quantum experiment (or reaction) tends to preserves the system in
the state it was before initiating these repetitions. Moreover, it has been shown by [20,21]

12

that this eﬀect can be generalized to a whole path of states in which the ﬁnal state is dif-
ferent from the initial state. That is, the mechanism of repetitions causes the realization of
this whole path from a very large number of diﬀerent ones. This has also been shown here
by calculating the joint probability of n diﬀerent reactions that occur each at its speciﬁc
place and time, and we see that repeating each such reaction a large number of times in a
ﬁnite total time causes the joint probability for the occurence of the n reactions to tend to
the unity value.

are allowed to be only in “state” 2, in which they are reﬂected between points on the outer circle

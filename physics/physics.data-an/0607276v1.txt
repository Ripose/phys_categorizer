Abstract

In this paper we present a continuous time dynamical model of het-
erogeneous agents interacting in a ﬁnancial market where transactions are
cleared by a market maker. The market is composed of fundamentalist,
trend following and contrarian agents who process information from the
market with diﬀerent time delays. Each class of investor is characterized
by path dependent risk aversion. We also allow for the possibility of evo-
lutionary switching between trend following and contrarian strategies. We
ﬁnd that the system shows periodic, quasi-periodic and chaotic dynamics
as well as synchronization between technical traders. Furthermore, the
model is able to generate time series of returns that exhibit statistical
properties similar to those of the S&P500 index, which is characterized
by excess kurtosis, volatility clustering and long memory.

1 Introduction

In recent years there has been a growing disaﬀection with the standard paradigm
of eﬃcient markets and rational expectations. In an eﬃcient market, asset prices
are the outcome of the trading of rational agents, who forecast the expected price

by exploiting all the information available and know that other traders are ra-
tional. This implies that prices must equal the fundamental prices and therefore
changes in prices are only caused by changes in the fundamental value. In real
markets, however, traders have diﬀerent information on traded assets and pro-
cess information diﬀerently, therefore the assumption of homogeneous rational
traders may not be appropriate. The eﬃcient market hypothesis motivates the
use of random walk increments in ﬁnancial time series modeling: if news about
fundamentals are normally distributed, the returns on an asset will be normal
as well. However the random walk assumption does not allow the replication of
some stylized facts of real ﬁnancial markets, such as volatility clustering, excess
kurtosis, autocorrelation in square and absolute returns, bubbles and crashes.
Recently a large number of models that take into account heterogeneity in ﬁ-
contributions to this literature include
nancial markets has been proposed.
[1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 12].
[13] analyze a market composed of a continuum of funda-
mentalists who show delays in information processing. These models allow for
the formation of speculative bubbles, which may be triggered by news about
fundamentals and reinforced by technical trading. Because of the presence of
nonlinearities according to which diﬀerent investors interact with one another,
these models are capable of generating stable equilibria, periodic, quasi-periodic
dynamics and strange attractors. This paper builds on the model of [13], which
is inspired by the models of thermodynamics of [7], [9], [10] and analyzes a ﬁnan-
cial market in which there are only fundamental investors who trade according
to the mispricing of the asset with delays which are uniformly distributed from
initial to current time. We generalize [13] by introducing a continuum of techni-
cal traders who behave as either trend followers or contrarians and a switching
rule between these technical trading rules. We will analyze how the interaction
of diﬀerent types of investors with path dependent risk aversion determines the
dynamics and the statistical properties of the system as key parameters are
changed.

2 The model

Let us consider a security continuously traded at price P (t) Assume that this
security is in ﬁxed supply, so that the price is only driven by excess demand. Let
us assume that the excess demand D(t) is a function of the current price and
the fundamental value F (t). A market maker takes a long position whenever
the excess demand is negative and a short position whenever the demand excess
is positive so as to clear the market. The market maker adjusts the price in the
direction of the excess demand with speed equal to λM . The instantaneous rate
of return is:

r(t)

≡

˙P (t)
P (t)

= λM D(P (t), F (t)); λM > 0.

the fundamental value is assumed to grow at a constant rate g, therefore:
˙F (t)
F (t)

= g.

The market is composed of an inﬁnite number of investors, who choose among
three diﬀerent investment strategies. Let us assume that a fraction α of investors
follows a fundamentalist strategy and a fraction (1
α) follows a technical anal-
ysis strategy. The fraction of technical analysts is in turn composed of a fraction
β) of contrarians. Let DF (t), DT F (t)
β of trend followers and a fraction (1
−
and DC (t) be respectively the demands of fundamentalists, trend followers and
contrarians rescaled by the proportions of agents who trades according to a
given strategy. The excess demand for the security is thus given:

−

D(t) = αDF (t) + (1

α)[βDT F (t) + (1

β)DC (t)] ; α, β ǫ [0, 1].

Each trader operate with a delay equal to τ , that is, the demand of a particular
trader at time t depends on her decision variable at time t
τ . Time delays are
uniformly distributed in the interval [0, t]. Fundamentalists react to diﬀerences
between price and fundamental value. The demand of fundamentalists operating
with delay τ is:

P (t
where λF τ is a parameter that measures the speed of reaction of fundamental
traders; we will assume that λF τ = λF throughout the paper. This demand
function implies that the fundamentalists believe that the price tends to the
fundamental value in the long run and reacts to the percentage mispricing of
the asset in symmetric way with respect to underpricing and overpricing.
If
time delays are uniformly distributed, the market demand of fundamentalists is
given by:

Following [13], let us modify equation (6) by introducing the variable ς and
adding a term

ς F (t)DF (t) to the RHS:1

˙DF (t) = λF log

ς(t)F DF (t) ; λF > 0.

(cid:20)

According to the sign of ς, if there is an excess demand, the term either drives it
towards zero (if ς F (t) is positive) or foster it (if ς F (t) is negative). The variable
ς F (t) may be interpreted as in indicator of the risk that traders bear and their
risk aversion (if ς F (t) is negative traders become risk-seekers). The dynamics
for ς F (t) are given by:

F
˙ς(t)

(8)
1[13] introduce the variable ξ, which is a liner transformation of DF (t), and utilize it
instead of DF (t) in the simulations. We will continue to utilize DF (T ) without any loss of
generality.

V F ] ; δF > 0

where V F is a factor controlling the variance. Throughout the paper we will
assume that V F is given. The rationale of (8) is that the larger an open position
on the asset, the more risk averse the agents become. Let us consider now the
behavior of technical traders. As for the fundamentalists, their time delays are
uniformly distributed in the interval [0, t]. A trader operating with delay τ
utilizes the percentage return that occurred at time t
τ in a linear prediction
rule in order to form an expectation of future returns. Let DT F τ and DCτ be
respectively the demands of trend followers and contrarians operating with delay
τ . Without taking risk attitudes into account, technical demands are given by:

−

Diτ (t) = λiτ log[r(t

τ )] ; i = T F, C ; λT F τ > 0 ; λCτ < 0.

(9)

−

Throughout the paper we will assume that DT F τ = DT F and DCτ = DC. By
integrating (9) with respect to τ , time diﬀerentiating and adding respectively
ς C(t)DC (t) in order to take into account the
the terms
risk and risk attitudes of technical traders, we get:

ς T F (t)DT F (t) and

−

−

˙Di(t) = λi log[r(t)]

ς i(t)DC (t) ; i = T F, C ; λT F τ > 0 ; λCτ < 0

(10)

ς C (t) have the same functional form as

ς F (t):

ς T F (t) and

−
˙ς i(t) = δi[Di(t)2

−

We will now consider the fraction α as given, whereas the fraction of trend
followers β may be path dependent. In fact, β is considered as an endogenous
variable because both trend followers and contrarians follow technical trading
strategies and therefore may be likely to switch them if one is more proﬁtable
than the other. We assume that the more proﬁtable is a strategy, the more
investors will choose that strategy. The diﬀerence in the absolute return at
time t between the two strategies is given by ˙P (t)[DT F (t)
DC (t)].2 Moreover,
β must be bounded in the interval [0, 1] and we assume that it tends to move
towards 0.5 if both strategies lead to equal proﬁts. These assumption hold if we
assume that dynamics for β is the following:

−

˙β(t) = cot[πβ(t)] + z ˙P (t)[DT F (t)

DC (t)] ; z

(12)

−

0

≥

where the ﬁrst term keeps the fraction of trend followers bounded in the interval
[0, 1] and z is a parameter that measure the speed of switching between the
technical strategies. If z=0 or if the proportion of trend followers and contrarians
is taken as a constant, then the system may be made stationary by deﬁning the
variable M (t)

F (t)/P (t), whose time derivative is:

2The use of absolute returns as a measure of evolutionary ﬁtness stems from the absence of
wealth in the model, therefore it is not possible to deﬁne the percentage return of a strategy.

3 Statistical properties

−

In this section, we analyze the statistical properties of the simulated time se-
ries, which have been generated by integrating the system up to time 9035 and
recording the price at integer times starting from t = 5000 in order to allow
the system to get suﬃciently close to the asymptotic dynamics and to have
time series as long as the daily time series of the S&P500 index between 1 Jan-
uary 1990 and 31 December 2005. The system has been integrated by utilizing
Mathematica 5.1. No stochastic elements are added, therefore the features of
system-generated time series are endogenous and originate from the nonlinear
structure of the systems. The model displays statistical properties similar to
those of the index S&P500 using various parameter values. In Table (1) there are
reported the statistics of the daily returns on the S&P500 and on the time series
generated by the system with parameters λM = 60, λF = 95/15, λT F = 0.25,
λC =
0.22, α = 0.6, δF = δT F = δC = 240000, V F = V T F = V C = 54000,
g = 0.000308, z = 0 and initial values P = 1.1, F = 1 DF = λF log[G(0)/P (0)],
DT F = DC = 0, ς F = ς T F = ς C = 1, β = 0.5. We have also reported the
value of the largest Lyapunov exponent. The growth rate of the fundamental,
g, is equal to the mean growth rate of S&P500, which in turn has been cal-
culated as the rate that in a continuously compounded capitalization regime
implies the same return on the index on the overall period. Since the price
moves around the fundamental, the mean of the simulated time series match
that of the S&P500. The other parameter values have been chosen so as to give
rise to statistics similar to those of the S&P500 index. As pointed out by [13],
kurtosis and volatility clustering are due to the delayed reaction of investors
that determines price overshooting. In a multi-agent modeling, such a process
is fostered by the interaction among investors who are heterogeneous not only
as concerns the time that they need to process information from the market,
but also the strategies that they use to predict future prices. Time series are
also characterized by long memory and nonlinear structure, which in turn im-
ply that volatility clustering occurs at diﬀerent time scales. Such characteristics
are typical of multifractal process. According to [8], a multifractal process is a
continuous time process with stationary increments which satisfy:

generated time series. Figure (1) reports the time series and the log-log plot

from 1 to 100 days. There is no apparent crossover up to a scale of 100 days
in the S&P500 and the linear ﬁt is very good, in accord with the behavior of a
multifractal process. Crossover occurs in the simulations for values of t between
e3 and e4 and the ﬂuctuations are more erratic than those of S&P500. Such a
behavior underlines the capability of the model to generate dynamics typical of
a multifractal process, however the dynamics for the fundamental implies that

x(t, log[10])

5

price is mean-reverting around an exponenential trend, which in turn implies
that crossover occurs for smaller time intervals than those of real time series.
The introduction of stochastic noises or a feedback between fundamental and
price determines more a realistic long-run behavior and scaling properties, as
we will show for the latter case in Section 4.4.

4 Sensitivity analysis

In this section we will ﬁrst analyze the system dynamics and then we will study
the variations in dynamics as some key parameters are changed. In Figure (2)
there are depicted the time series of the last 500 observations of prices of S&P500
and model, returns, demands, risk attitudes and the projections of the phase
space on the planes [DF , ς F ], [DT F , ς T F ], [DC , ς C ]. Tables (3,4,5) show statis-
tics for diﬀerent parameters values. The demands of technical traders switch
between positive and negative phases, diﬀerently from the fundamentalist de-
mand, which instead tends to move around zero. The presence of long phases of
positive and negative demands of technical traders, together with the dynamics
for the risk aversions may determine very large price oscillations in both di-
rections. The increase in the fundamental value triggers a stock price increase
due to the purchases by fundamentalists, which is reinforced by the action of
trend followers. The demand of fundamentalists has smaller oscillations in the
periods where the risk aversion is high, because a high risk aversion induces the
fundamentalists not to open large positions if the stock is mispriced. Whereas
the risk aversion of fundamentalists follows well deﬁned trends and is on aver-
age positive, those of technical traders tends to oscillate around zero. As such,
technical traders switch between phases in which they are risk averse and phases
in which are risk seekers. The dynamics for the risk attitudes may be explained
in the following way: let us assume that the price is rising and the demand of
trend followers is positive and greater than √V T F . Equation (11) implies that
their risk aversion rises as well. The increase in price reduces the demand of
fundamentalists and contrarians, but reinforces that of trend followers, which on
the other hand tends to fall because of the increase in their risk aversion. Once
the price falls, the demand of trend followers approaches zero (eventually be-
coming negative) and, as a consequence, their risk aversion falls. The dynamics
are also the same in the case where the cycle is triggered by fundamentalists or
contrarians. Risk attitudes may vary considerably even during phases in which
the demands are almost steady. Indeed it is suﬃcient that the absolute value
of the demand of investors type i remains for a long time respectively above
√V i to get a considerable change in risk aversion. The time derivatives of the
risk attitudes tend to reach their lower bounds, which are respectively equal to
δCV C , only when the demands are very close to zero.

4.1. Eﬀects of changing the proportion of fundamentalists and techni-
cal traders. In order to analyze the eﬀect of the proportion of fundamentalists
and technical traders, we select values of α ranging from 0 to 1 and with a diﬀer-

6

ence of 0.1 between a simulation and the next. If there are no fundamentalists
or if their proportion is only ten percent, the price goes to inﬁnity, because
technical trading drives the price away from the fundamental.3 If α = 0.1 the
fundamentalists are able to steer the price to the fundamental value, but prices
are subject to large oscillations induced by technical traders. Such oscillations
become larger and larger as time goes on. In fact larger departures from the
fundamental value are needed for the fundamentalists to bring the price back
close to the fundamental value. When α = 0.2 the departure from the funda-
mental value brings about long phases in which the fundamentalists go either
long or short on the asset, determining in this way an increase in their risk
aversion. This in turn implies a lower capability of oﬀsetting technical traders.
The overall demand of the latter presents long phases in which the demand is
either positive or negative, phases in which it changes sign quickly and phases
where the demands of contrarians and trend followers synchronize and oﬀset
each other. During phases of synchronization the system reduces by one dimen-
sion. When the technical demand is equal or close to zero, fundamentalists bring
the price back close to the fundamental value. As a consequence of the fact that
the total demand does not change sign for long periods, the price tends to follow
a monotonic trajectory when it is far from the fundamental and to oscillate as
it gets close to it. Thus, the synchronization of technical traders determines an
intermittent behavior in the system with regular monotonic phases interrupted
by chaotic bursts. The time series of fundamentalist and technical demands
are depicted in Table (3).4 If α = 0.3 the proportion of fundamentalist is suf-
ﬁciently high as to prevent technical trading from bringing about larger and
larger departures from the fundamental value. The oscillations have anyway
larger amplitudes than in the case where α = 0.4, and this in turn determines
an increase in the variance and a decrease in the kurtosis. If fundamentalists
account for half of the investors, the demand of technical traders is generally
lower than in the baseline case because fundamental trading prevents strong
changes in the price. This leaves little room for a persistent phase of funda-
mentalist demand and therefore fundamentalists are more likely to became risk
seekers. The higher proportion of fundamentalists determines a more regular
behavior of the system, as denoted by the decrease in kurtosis. If the fraction of
fundamentalists is equal to or greater than sixty percent, the system no longer
converges to a strange attractor, but to a quasi-periodic attractor, as denoted
by the values of the Lyapunov exponents. If there are only fundamentalists the
attractor becomes strange again and the Lyapunov exponent rises up to 0.53689,
which would indicate a highly chaotic system. However the rise in the Lyapunov
exponent is due to the increase in the amplitudes of the oscillations that in turn
are due to the overreaction induced by the delayed reaction of fundamentalists,
which brings price above (below) the fundamental price when the security is
originally underpriced (overpriced).

3The price goes to zero with other parameter values. What matters here is that the price

does not match the fundamental in the long run.

4The Lyapunov exponent is not reported for α = 0.1, 0.2 because is meaningless when the

dynamics are not bounded.

7

4.2. Eﬀects of changing the speed of expected price adjustment of fun-
damentalists. Increasing the speed reaction of fundamentalists brings about
a decrease in the variance because the price tends to stay close to the fun-
damental. The system undergoes a global bifurcation as the parameter λF is
increased, indeed the dynamics show a cyclical behavior after a transient chaotic
phase. This kind of transition, called attractor destruction, is a type of crisis-
induced intermittency and has been investigated by [5] and [6]. However, for
large values of λF the attractor becomes strange again. Because of the presence
of technical traders, which are aﬀected by the changes in prices triggered by the
fundamentalists, it is not possible to determine what the dynamics eventually
are as the reaction speed of the fundamentalists is further increased. For in-
stance, if λF = 190 the dynamics are periodic, but if if λF = 300 the attractor
is strange, with a Lyapunov exponent of 0.240495. The projections of a limit
cycle to which the system converges when λF = 190 are represented in Figure (4)

4.3. Eﬀects of switching between trend following and contrarian
strategies. So far we have dealt with a model where the proportion between
trend followers and contrarians are kept constant. If z > 0 such proportions be-
come path dependent. The higher the value of z, the higher the fraction of trend
followers because this strategy is generally more proﬁtable than the contrarian
one, since price grows in the long run. Simulations for diﬀerent values of z show
that a higher proportion of trend followers causes greater departures from the
fundamental value triggering a reaction by all types of investors. Such dynamics
bring about an increase in the variance and skewness of returns. Skewness tends
to increase because overshooting is positive on average, since price tends to fol-
low an exponentially growing fundamental. Kurtosis ﬁrst tends to increase and
then to decrease because the increase in variance for high values of z determines
that some returns previously in the tails of the distribution now approach the
center.

4.4. Eﬀects of introducing a feedback between price and fundamen-
tal. We will assume now that the fundamental value is aﬀected by the asset
price. The economic rationale is that a higher price boosts consumption and,
as a consequence, the real economy as a whole. We assume that the dynamics
of the fundamental follows the diﬀerential equation:

˙F (t)
F (t)

P (t)
F (t)

= g + m

; m = 0.5.

(15)

The introduction of this kind of feedback induces a unit root behavior in the
price time series with scaling properties very to those of S&P500. This is ap-
parent from Figure (5) where there are reported the simulated time series and

5 Conclusion

In this paper we have outlined a continuous time deterministic model of a ﬁ-
nancial market with heterogeneous interacting agents. The dynamical system is
able to generate some stylized facts present in real markets, even in a purely de-
terministic setting: excess kurtosis, volatility clustering and long memory. Even
in the case where fundamentalists are the only agents present in the market,
they are unable to drive the price back to the fundamental on a steady state tra-
jectory. Moreover, the increase in the fundamentalist reaction speed may even
increase the disorder in the system, because the fundamentalists trigger a strong
response of technical traders. It may also be possible that, when the fraction
of fundamentalists is low, trend followers and contrarians give rise to synchro-
nization in the system, bringing about a dramatic change in the dynamics. The
introduction of an evolutionary switching between technical traders leads to an
increase in the volatility and in the kurtosis, provided that the speed of switch-
ing is not too high because otherwise the increase in the variance makes it less
likely that returns will fall in the tails of the distributions. Further research will
take into account more realistic distribution functions for the agents, the intro-
duction of stochastic disturbances and a deeper investigation of the interaction
between price and fundamental.

Abstract. Many physical systems can be adequately modelled using a second order approximation.
The problem of plant identiﬁcation reduces to the problem of estimating the position of a single pair
of complex conjugate poles.

One approach to the problem is to apply the method of least squares to the time domain data. This
type of computation is best carried out in "batch" mode and applies to an entire data set. Another
approach would be to design an adaptive ﬁlter and to use autoregressive, AR, techniques. This would
be well suited to continuous real-time data and could track slow changes on the underlying plant.

I this paper we present a very fast but approximate technique for the estimation of the position
of a single pair of complex conjugate poles, using the Hilbert transform to reconstruct the analytic
signal.

INTRODUCTION

In the theory of control, it is most common for physical systems to be mathematically
modelled using coupled linear systems of ordinary differential equations[1]. When these
equations are transformed using integral transforms, such as those of Laplace or Fourier,
then the physical systems are modelled using ﬁnite rational polynomials in an auxiliary
variable, s = jw

:

H(s) =

output(s)
input(s)

=

P(s)
Q(s)

.

(1)

The zeros of the polynomial, Q(s), are called “poles” and correspond to responses that
have ﬁnite output for zero input. These are called "modes." It is very common for one
mode to dominate the response of the whole system. It is also common for this mode
to be of a damped oscillatory type, corresponding to a single pair of complex conjugate
poles. This can occur whenever the potential energy function of the system has a local
minimum [2] In this case, we can approximate a large complicated system, with many
poles and zeros, by a simple second-order system with a single pair of complex conjugate
poles. This is called the second-order approximation. Many mechanical or electrical
systems can be realistically modelled using the second-order approximation. We can
write:

a2s2 + a1s + a0
2 .
s2 + 2a s + w
0
If we wish to model the behaviour of a real physical system, using an approximate
second-order model, then it is necessary for us to estimate the position of the pole pair.

This could be done in the frequency domain, by exciting the system with a sinusoidal
source and then measuring the magnitude and phase of the response at different fre-
quencies, but this is often not practical. There are situations when the only practical
sources are step functions, 1(t) or impulses d (t). We can excite the system with steps or
impulses and then sample the response in the time domain. The impulse response of a
second-order system will generally be of the form:

y(t) = Ae−

The problem of plant identiﬁcation then becomes equivalent to asking: How do we
estimate the position of the pair of complex-conjugate poles if the only data at our
disposal is a set of time-domain samples of the response of the system to steps or
impulses.

As a possible illustration, we could imagine that we strike a bell with a hammer and
then record the sound as it gradually decays. We want to estimate the damped frequency
of oscillation, w
, using only the data from our sound
recording.

d, and the damping coefﬁcient, a

If we knew something about the distribution of the errors of measurement then we
could apply the method of maximum likelihood to estimate the parameters , w
.
If the errors were known to be the result of a very large number of uncorrelated random
effects then we could apply the Central Limit Theorem and we could assume that the
errors had a Gaussian distribution. The problem of plant identiﬁcation would reduce to
a non-linear least-squares estimation problem [3]. The difﬁculty with this approach is
that the resulting equations would be non-linear and would have to be solved iteratively,
using a numerical method such as gradient descent. A further weakness of this approach
is that it would be an exact solution to an approximation of the real problem. It would
be far more reasonable to have a quick but approximate solution to the approximate,
second-order, problem. This would tell us most of what we need to know without having
to waste a lot of effort.

d and a

In this paper, we present a fast, but approximate, algorithm for the estimation of
the position of a complex conjugate pair of poles on the s plane. We use a discrete
approximation to the Hilbert Transform , to reconstruct the complex analytic signal
form the sampled real time signal. The analytic signal has a complex-exponential form.
We apply very simple statistical techniques to the analytic signal in order to obtain the
required parameters. This approach is an alternative to the more conventional, non-linear
least squares or Autoregressive, AR, approaches to the problem.

The problem of parameter identiﬁcation, for a freely vibrating system has been studied
by Feldman [4] who used the Hilbert Transform to provide information about instanta-
neous amplitude and phase of a signal. The method that we present here is more simple,
and limited, than the approach used by Feldman.

THE ANALYTIC SIGNAL OF THE SECOND ORDER RESPONSE

The response described in Equation 3 is equivalent to

y(t) = Ce−

a t cos

w

dt

f

−

where C = √A2 + B2, cos(f ) = A/√A2 + B2 and sin(f ) = B/√A2 + B2. This type of
function will apply whenever the input to the system is zero. If the input is a ﬁnite sum
of step and impulse function then the input will be zero for most of the time. There will
be abrupt changes in C and f but the parameters, a and w
d will be constant as long as
the structure of the plant is maintained.

The immediate aim is to reconstruct the analytic signal. The Hilbert transform [5, 6, 7]

is a standard technique for achieving this. The Hilbert transform of u(t) is deﬁned as:

−
It has the important property that it deﬁnes the relationship between the real and imagi-
nary parts of a complex analytic function. If we have an analytic function:

F (t) = u(t) + jv(t)

with real and imaginary parts u(t) and v(t) then the relation for v(s) is given by Equation
5. Bedrosian’s theorem tells us that the Hilbert transform of a(t) cos(w
t).
If we apply Bedrosian’s [6]theorem and the shifting property to Equation 4 then we ﬁnd
that the analytic signal is:

This allows us to directly estimate the parameters, a and w
d. We note that the use of
the difference operation has removed all reference to C and to f . This means that the
method is not sensitive to the initial conditions that apply immediately after the shocks
that occur then the impulses and steps are fed into the system. Our only requirement is
that the input to the system is zero for most of the time.

The Matlab code required to implement this algorithm is very short and simple:

% reconstruct the analytic signal, y2
y2 = hilbert( y );
% take the natural logarithm, log(y2)
L = log(y2) ;
% unwrap the phase of the log(y2)
L = real(L) + j*unwrap(imag(L));
% estimate the differences of the log of y2
D = diff(L) ;

A SIMPLE STATISTICAL TECHNIQUE

Equation 10 suggests that we should be able to precisely estimate the required parame-
ters. There are a few practical problems with the direct application of Equation 10:

• The numerical calculation of the Hilbert transform relies on the Fast Fourier
Transform and there are limitations imposed by the ﬁnite number of samples. These
includes the “Gibbs effect,” due to the ﬁnite length of the data set.

• Real samples from a physical process will be subject to noise and errors of

measurement. The differencing operation tends to magnify the effect of noise.

• There would be a number of outliers caused by the “shocks” of the steps or

impulses. Some measurements will not be reliable.

The authors have found that the median is a very robust measure of location and is
less subject to the inﬂuence of the outlying values than the arithmetic mean. The Matlab
code for this is very simple:

% calculate the real and imaginary parts of the differences
= real(D) ;
d_mag
d_phase = imag(D) ;
% calculate the median rates of change
mid_re_slope = median(d_mag) ;
mid_im_slope = median(d_phase) ;

SOME RESULTS

A second order system was simulated, using known parameters, and the parameters were
then estimated using the new algorithm. The reconstructed analytic signal is shown in
Figure 1.

This same data can be represented in three dimensions. This is shown in Figure 2.
The logarithmic slopes were estimated and the parameters were calculated.
The quality factor of the simulated system was Q = 10 and so the theoretical value
est = 0.0472. The
d = 1.0 and the estimate was

of the damping constant was a = 0.05. The estimated value was a
characteristic frequency of the simulated plant was w
w
est = 0.9948.

signiﬁcant error in the reconstructed signal near the sample boundaries, due to the Gibbs effect. This is
the result of fact that Matlab uses the FFT to calculate the Hilbert transform.

The general appearance of damped oscillation is unmistakable.

Our simulations suggest that this is a fast but approximate technique for the estimation
of the position of a single pair of complex conjugate poles but it is sensitive to a number
of factors which may limit its practical application.

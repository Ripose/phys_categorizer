On Computation of Combined IVS EOP Series

Zinovy Malkin
Central (Pulkovo) Astronomical Observatory RAS, St. Petersburg, Russia

Abstract

Three topics related to computation of the combined IVS EOP series are discussed. The ﬁrst one is
the consistency of the VLBI EOP series with the IERS reference frames ITRF and ICRF. Not all IVS
analysis centers use ITRF/ICRF as reference system for EOP solutions. Some of them realize global
solution for simultaneous determination of CRF, TRF and EOP with no-net-rotation constrains w.r.t.
ITRF/ICRF. Analysis shows that such a method can hardly provide consistency of computed EOP series
with the IERS reference frames with suﬃcient accuracy. Direct use of ITRF and ICRF for computation
of EOP series submitted to the IERS seems preferable. Second problem is the long-time stability of
the IVS EOP series. Analysis of yearly biases w.r.t. C04 and NEOS is presented. A possible ways
are proposed to save long time stability of the combined IVS EOP series. At last, various strategies of
computation of weighted mean value are considered. It’s shown that usual methods used for this purpose
do not provide satisfactory result for the error of the mean. A new method is proposed.

Introduction

The IVS combined EOP series computed at the IVS Analysis Coordinator Oﬃce located at the Geodetic
Institute of the University of Bonn is available beginning from the end of 2000. Analysis of this series
routinely provided by the IERS EOP Product Center at the Paris Observatory shows that its accuracy is
better than accuracy of individual solutions provided by the IVS Analysis Centers. However, some topics
related to the quality of the IVS combined EOP series seems to be investigated more carefully. This paper
is intended to consider the following points:

Consistency of the VLBI EOP series with the IERS reference frames ITRF and ICRF.

•

•

•

Systematic stability of the VLBI EOP series.

Computation of weighted mean values.

2 Consistency of IVS EOP series with IERS reference systems

According to the IVS Terms of Reference, IVS serves as the VLBI Technique Center for IERS. In turn,
the IERS Terms of Reference said that one of the IERS primary objectives is providing Earth orientation
parameters (EOP) required to transform between ICRF and ITRF. It is supposed that after completion of
new IERS structure the IERS EOP product will be computed combining several EOP series delivered by
the IERS Technique Centers one of which is the IVS. So, the evident goal of the IVS is computation of the
combined IVS EOP series providing the transformation parameters between ITRS and ICRS.

However, not all IVS analysis centers use ITRF/ICRF as reference system for EOP solutions. Some of
them realize global solution for simultaneous determination of CRF, TRF and EOP. To tie a global solution
to IERS reference frames no-net-rotation constrains w.r.t. ITRF and ICRF are usually applied. The question
is can such a method provide the consistency of VLBI EOP series with ITRF/ICRF with required accuracy?
Usually global VLBI solution is made using all available sessions and application of no-net-rotation
ITRF and ICRF.

provides zero translation and rotation of full set of stations and radio sources w.r.t.

However, commonly speaking, it is not the case for the subset of stations participating in a particular
session. Therefore EOP estimate obtained from processing of a session observations may systematically
diﬀer from ITRF/ICRF.

Besides, number of observations for stations and sources diﬀer very much. Table 1 shows statistics of
observations for stations and sources for all sessions and for NEOS-A ones. One can see that in fact the
NEOS-A EOP series used in the IVS combined solution is practically deﬁned by subset of 8 stations and 66
radio sources.

Let us see how close is the tie between diﬀerent subsets of station and source catalogs with ITRF/ICRF.
We use results of the USNO9903 global solution as most fresh publicly available one. Tables 3 and 2 present
transformation parameters between USNO solution and ITRF(ICRF) for all common stations (sources),
for all stations (sources) participating in the NEOS-A program, and for most frequently observing stations
(observed sources). These data show that the transformation parameters including ones deﬁning EOP system
are not equal to zero and diﬀer for various subsets of stations and sources. This mean that EOP system is
not correspond to ITRF/ICRF and diﬀer for various observational programs.

Therefore, CRF and TRF realization obtained from a global VLBI solution can hardly provide consistency
of computed EOP series with ITRF/ICRF with suﬃcient accuracy. Direct use of the ITRF and ICRF for
computation of EOP series submitted to the IERS seems preferable.

This does not mean indeed that the IVS Analysis centers should not compute global solutions. The
reasonable strategy may be using individual CRF and TRF realizations for improving the IERS reference
frames, and further using ICRF and ITRF for regular EOP computation. This strategy provides consis-
tency between VLBI EOP series and the IERS reference frames and makes individual VLBI EOP series
more homogeneous that allows to simplify combination procedure and improve quality of the IVS combined
product.

Now the IERS and main space geodesy services are in the process of moving from ITRF97 to ITRF2000.
What systematic changes in the VLBI EOP series can we expect? Table 4 shows the results of comparison
between ITRF97 and ITRF2000 for diﬀerent subsets of VLBI stations.

We also compared the EOP series computed at the IAA with ITRF97 and ITRF2000. The result is shown
in Table 4. The computation was made with three radio source catalogues ICRF-Ext.1, RSC(IAA)99R02
and RSC(IAA)01R02, and no meaningful systematic diﬀerences between EOP series computed with ITRF97
and ITRF2000 was found.

Although ITRF2000 was constructed in such a way that no rotation w.r.t.

ITRF97 was introduced,
substantial value of rotation angle R2 (which corresponds to Y pole coordinate) is found both in direct
comparison of two coordinate systems and in the result of EOP computation.

In conclusion, it’s important to mention that errors of inconsistency between EOP series and terrestrial
and celestial reference frames are systematic ones and even their relatively small values can be substantial.

3 Long-time stability of IVS EOP series

Obviously, one of the main goal of maintenance of the IVS combined products is to provide systematically
stable IVS EOP series. It is especially important now because the new IERS organization envisages compu-
tation of the IERS combined EOP series practically of the three series VLBI, GPS and SLR, and importance

of each of them is very large. Several factors make this task diﬃcult and in the ﬁrst place it is instability of
individual series. The main reason for that are:

•

•

•

•

Using individual periodically updated TRF and CRF realizations. As shown in the previous section
these realization are not tied to the unique (IERS) reference frames with suﬃcient accuracy and, in
fact, every VLBI session yields EOP estimates in its own system.

Change in systematic errors of EOP series after modiﬁcation of models, algorithms and software.

Change of set of contributed VLBI Analysis Centers. Besides a diﬀerence in used reference systems,
each EOP series has its own systematic peculiarities.

Change of network conﬁguration. This is well established fact, and it is not quite clear how to handle
it properly. For instance, we can mention the problem of joining 9-year IRIS-A and 8-year NEOS-A
programs to avoid EOP jump directly aﬀected results of determination of 18.6-year nutation term.

For listed above and other reasons the VLBI EOP series show long-time instability. To investigated this
eﬀect we use ﬁve VLBI EOP series BKG00001, GSF2000A, IAAO9907, SPU00001, USN99003 over a 7-year
interval from May 1993 till April 2000 (NEOS-A data only). The whole 7-year interval was split in 7 one-year
ones and each series was compared with combined C04 and NEOS series at these one-year intervals. During
computation six parameters of systematic diﬀerences between VLBI and combined series were estimated
for every year. These are: bias, rate, amplitude of sine and cosine of annual term and semiannual terms.
In such a way we obtained seven values for each of six parameters of model of systematic errors for each
VLBI series. The ﬁnal step of this analysis was the computation of RMS values from seven epochs. Such a
approach to investigation of long-time stability is analogous to a method used at the Paris observatory during
computation of the IERS combined products. Result of analysis of yearly biases is presented in Table 5.

Obviously, this analysis cannot be fully objective because it depends on details of combination procedure
(systematic corrections, weights, etc.) used during computation of C04 and NEOS series. One can see that

4

diﬀerences between the left and the right parts of Table 5 is sometimes quite large, especially for UT1-UTC.
Maybe using IVS combined EOP series for such a analysis would be preferable when it will have suﬃcient
time span.

The results of analysis presented here and in the previous section conﬁrm well known fact that each EOP
series has own systematic errors and these errors are not stable at the required level of accuracy. Therefore
it seems very important to develop appropriate strategy for computation of the IVS combined product to
provide make its systematic stability. We would like to propose for discussion a possible strategy to keep
long-time systematic stability of the IVS EOP combined series. This strategy includes the following steps.

1. Computation of the “reference” EOP series EOP0 as the mean of existing long-time NEOS-A series
ﬁxed at epoch of computation with weights depending on long-time stability. Input series should be
transformed to uniform TRF/CRF (preferably the IERS ones) as accurate as possible.

2. Using systematic corrections to individual series

derived from comparison with the reference series in further computations.

3. When an ACi updates EOP series new systematic correction can be computed as

dEOPi = EOP0

EOPi

−

4. When a new EOP series of a new AC is to be included in the IVS combination systematic correction

to that series will be

(EOPi,old

EOPi,new) + dEOPi .

−

dEOPj = EOP0

EOPj .

−

5. Periodical update of the reference series, e.g. when new ITRF or ICRF realization is accepted. Evi-
dently, in such a case, appropriate care of careful tie between the new and the old reference series must
be taken.

A separate problem is the transformation of EOP obtained on diﬀerent networks to the reference series.
However, hopefully improvement of ITRF and models of VLBI observations will eliminate this problem in
the future.

4 Computation of weighted mean

Computation of the weighted mean of several estimates is usually the ﬁnal step in each EOP (and all others)
combining procedure. Let we have n values xi with associated errors si, i = 1 . . . n. Then we have a well
known statistics [1, 2]

where x is a estimate of the mean value. The question is how to estimate error σ of the mean? Two classical
approaches are:

Maximum likelihood approach if σi are considered as absolute magnitudes of errors in xi:

n

X

i=1 (cid:20)

It is easy to see that σ1 depends only on a priori errors in averaged values xi and σ1 depends only on the
scatter of xi. Theoretically, solution of problem of choice between σ1 and σ2 depend on whether the scatter
of xi is a result of random errors or there are systematic diﬀerences between estimates xi. Obviously, both
eﬀect are present in most of practical applications.

That is a known problem in data processing and no rigorous solution is proposed. However some practical
ways to handle it were considered in literature. Evidently, the most statistically substantial approach was
made in [1, 3]. According to this approach chi-square criteria is used to decide if the scatter of xi is result of
random errors, and error of the mean x is computed as

σ3 =

σ1,

σ2,

if H > χ2(Q, n

−

−

where Q is a ﬁducial probability. Some other practical algorithms of choice between σ1 and σ2 were proposed
too.

However, in practice, values of σ1 and σ2 may diﬀer by several times. It leads to instability of σ estimate.
Table 6 shows some numerical examples of computation of weighted mean of two data points and its error
(to compute σ3 we use Q=99% which corresponds χ2(0.99,1)=6.63). One can see that no one value of σ1,
xi, si
σ2, σ3 provides a satisfactory estimate of σ. Moreover, value of σ3 depends not only on data sample
but also on subjective choice of Q.

After many experiments with test data we decided in favor of simple formula

which can be called “combined” approach. The last column of Table 6 shows that such a approach can
provide stable and realistic estimate of error of the mean.
More detailed consideration of this topic is given in [4].

5 Conclusions

Results of this study allow to make the following conclusions:

•

•

Procedure of computation of the IVS combined EOP series must be “absolute”, i.e.
independent on
any reference, e.g. IERS, series. Otherwise details of combination procedure used during computation
of “external” reference series (systematic corrections, weights) will aﬀect the results of analysis.

It seems preferable to use ITRF and ICRF by the all IVS Analysis Centers for computation of VLBI
EOP series submitted to the IVS and IERS. Using individual TRF/CRF lead to diﬃculties in inter-
pretation of results. Usual procedure of determination of systematic diﬀerences between EOP series
provides correction only for “global” orientation between TRF/CRF. But, as it was shown above
transformation parameters between individual TRF (CRF) realizations depend on sub-set of stations
(sources) used for comparison. This means that, commonly speaking, every session produce EOP in
its own system, which makes it diﬃcult to transform an individual EOP series to ITRF/ICRF with
suﬃcient accuracy.

•

A reference EOP series based on IVS combined solution for ﬁxed set of individual solutions can be
used to save the long-time stability. Also, it is important to develop appropriate strategy to include
new or updated solutions in the IVS combination, e.g. using strategy proposed in this paper.

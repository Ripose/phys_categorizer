Abstract

On the basis of our mixed-signal simulations we report signiﬁcant stochastic resonance induced

input-output signal improvement in the double-well system for aperiodic input types. We used a

pulse train with randomised pulse locations and a band-limited noise with low cut-oﬀ frequency

as input signals, and applied a cross-spectral measure to quantify their noise content. We also

supplemented our examinations with simulations in the Schmitt trigger to show that the signal

improvement we obtained is not a result of a potential ﬁltering eﬀect due to the limited response

time of the double-well dynamics.

INTRODUCTION

Having originated in the context of ice ages [1], stochastic resonance (SR) is nowadays

often given a signal processing interpretation: noise aids a weak signal to surpass some kind

of barrier in a system, which is then reﬂected in the noise content of the output of the

system. As the most widely used measure of this noise content is the signal-to-noise ratio

(SNR), one quantitative deﬁnition of SR may be a noise-induced optimisation of the output

SNR. Stochastic resonance in itself means using noise to make the output less noisy than

it would be without noise, yet the signal processing approach just mentioned impels one

to to raise the question whether, in the framework of SR, noise can also make the output

less noisy as compared to the input, similarly to the way ﬁlters do. This question has long

intrigued researchers working in the ﬁeld of SR, and after a few unsuccessful attempts at the

beginning, SR-induced input-output improvement has been demonstrated in a wide range

of systems from a simple level crossing detector [2, 3] and other static non-linearities [4]

to the Schmitt trigger [5] and even dynamical systems such as neuronal models [6] or the

archetypal double-well potential [7].

To our present knowledge it seems unlikely that stochastic resonance will ever rival ﬁlters

in technical applications designed to improve signal quality. Yet there may exist processes,

like neural signal transfer, where SR represents the only viable method of amplifying sub-

threshold stimuli, and a number of ﬁndings do point in this direction [8, 9]. As aperiodic

signals are native in this class of processes, studying their role in SR-induced signal improve-

ment is not at all without relevance.

Quantifying the noise content of aperiodic signals poses a special problem, as the most

widely used deﬁnition of the signal-to-noise ratio is valid in the strict sense only for harmonic

signals, and even its wide-band extension depends on the condition of periodicity in the input

signal. Several cross-correlational and cross-spectral measures have been in use in the ﬁeld

of aperiodic SR to circumvent this problem; here we adopt the cross-spectral treatment used

by L B Kish [2].

In our present study, we apply a mixed-signal simulation environment to examine whether

aperiodic signals—a randomised pulse train and a band-limited noise as signal—can also be

improved by SR occurring in the archetypal double-well system.

II. MODELLING AND METHODS

A. Measures of noise content

The ﬁrst to introduce the technical notion of signal-to-noise ratio into SR research were

Fauve and Heslot when reporting stochastic resonance in a real-world electronic device, the

Schmitt trigger [10]. SNR then became widely adopted as the quantiﬁer of SR, most often

taken in the following form to facilitate analytical treatment [11]:

lim∆f →0

f0+∆f
f0−∆f S(f )df

,

R :=

R
SN (f0)

(1)

(2)

wherein f0 is the frequency of the signal, S(f ) denotes the power spectral density (PSD) of

the signal and SN (f ) stands for the background noise PSD. This deﬁnition solely concerns

the immediate neighbourhood of the ﬁrst spectral peak, thus, strictly speaking, it yields

an appropriate description of noise content only in the case of sinusoidal signals.

In our

papers, we have argued for the adoption of a more practical SNR interpretation favoured

in electronics, which takes into account all spectral peaks and the whole background noise

power:

Rw := P

∞
k=1 lim∆f →0

kf0+∆f
kf0−∆f S(f )df
R
∞
0 SN (f ) df
R

.

This deﬁnition (to which, contrasting it to the narrow-band scope of the deﬁnition in Eq 1,

we refer as the wide-band SNR) is valid for non-sinusoidal periodic signals as well, and, as we

have demonstrated in [7], it provides a much more realistic account of signal improvement

even in the case of a sine input.

For all measures of noise content, the chief diﬃculty lies in separating signal from noise.

Sometimes, especially in the case of the narrow-band deﬁnition in Eq (1), this was carried

out by recording the PSD of the output when noise was fed into the input without any signal.

This method doubled the simulation workload, as each simulation step was to be repeated

without input signal, while its validity was also questionable from a theoretical point of

view, since it failed to take into account the cross-modulation between signal and noise

which occurs due to the non-linearity inherent in systems showing SR. In most cases, when

the background noise PSD is smooth, signal-noise separation may be simpliﬁed by taking

the noisy spectra as a whole and calculating the PSD of the noise at the signal frequency

(or the integer multiples of the signal frequency in the case of the wide-band deﬁnition) as

3

the average of PSD values in the neighbourhood of the spectral peak (excluding the peak

itself, of course); the signal PSD is then the PSD at the spectral peak minus this averaged

noise background.

When the input signal is aperiodic, neither of the above-mentioned methods works, be-

cause signal power is not concentrated at particular frequencies. This case calls for a more

elaborate technique of signal-noise separation, which is usually based on either the cross-

correlation (as, for example, in [12]) or the cross-spectrum between the noiseless input and

the noisy signal. Here we reach back to the treatment used in [2], and take the signal PSD

at the output as the part of the total PSD which shows correlation with the noiseless input,

reﬂected in their cross-spectrum:

where Sin, out (f ) denotes the cross power spectral density of the input signal and the total
output, while Ssig

in (f ) is the PSD of the input signal. As the input signal and the noise are

uncorrelated, the noise component of the output can be obtained simply as

out (f ) is the PSD of the total output. The cross-spectral SNR at the output is then

As we are interested in input-output signal improvement, we also need a cross-spectral SNR

B. The mixed-signal simulation environment

We modelled the archetypal dynamical SR system in which the overdamped motion of a

particle in a double-well potential is given by the following Langevin equation:

dx
dt

= x (t) − x3 (t) + p (t) + w (t) ,

(10)

wherein p (t) denotes the input signal and w (t) stands for the noise (a physical white noise—

that is, having a limited bandwidth—in our case). Comparing the noise content of the input

and output signals, we looked for a signal improvement induced by stochastic resonance.

We applied a mixed-signal (ie, having both digital and analogue components) simulation

system to realise the double-well potential and solve Eq (10). To obtain the solution of the

latter, we ﬁrst transformed it into an integral form:

x (t) =

x (τ ) − x3 (τ ) + p (τ ) + w (τ )

dτ.

(11)

o

t

Z

0 n

We generated the input signal and the noise digitally, then converted them into analogue

signals. All mathematical operations in Eq (11), such as addition, multiplication and inte-

gration, were performed by analogue devices. The output of our analogue circuitry was the

solution of Eq (11), which we then transmitted through an anti-aliasing ﬁlter and converted

back to the digital domain using high-resolution A/D converters. In order to avoid artefacts

that might stem from diﬀerent treatment, we used the very same ﬁltering and sampling

unit to digitise both the input and the output. The simulation system was driven by a

high-performance digital signal processor (DSP), under the control of a computer running

LabVIEW, which also performed all evaluation tasks. Our mixed-signal simulation system

is summed up in Fig 1.

It is worth noting that the analogue integrator introduces a 1/(RC) factor into Eq (11),

wherein R and C are the resistance and the capacitance in the integrator circuit. The output

of the integrator is therefore not exactly the solution x(t) but

y(t) =

y(τ ) − y3(τ ) + p(τ ) + w(τ )

wherein b := RC/(1 s). Substituting s := τ · 1/b, we see that the integrator transforms the

time scale by a b factor:

y(t) = Z

(13)

This means that the actual frequency scale in the analogue circuitry is 1/b times the theo-

retical frequency scale corresponding to Eqs (10) and (11). In our simulations, the value of
b was 1.2 · 10−4.

We used three types of input signals in our simulations: the periodic pulse train for which

we have already obtained high SNR gains in the double-well system [7], included here for

the purposes of comparison between the wide-band and the cross-spectral gain, and two

aperiodic signals, a pulse train with randomised pulse locations and a band-limited noise

whose upper cut-oﬀ frequency is much smaller than the bandwidth of the noise as stochastic

excitation (see Fig 2). In the case of pulse trains, we deﬁned the duty cycle of the signal as

2τ /T , where τ is the pulse width and T is the period of the periodic pulse train.

The parameters of our mixed-signal simulations are summarised in Table I. In the case of

the randomised pulse train, we determined the peak locations randomly before starting the

simulations and then used exactly the same waveform in each realisation during averaging,

while the band-limited noise as signal was generated anew in each averaging step. We also

determined the threshold amplitude AT experimentally as the minimum signal amplitude at

which switching between wells can occur without noise, and expressed the signal amplitude

III. RESULTS

First, for the purposes of validation we compared the two kinds of gains (Gw and Gcs) for

a periodic pulse train, in which case both are valid measures and they should theoretically

yield the same results. Indeed, Fig 3 shows that the diﬀerence between them is negligible.

Figure 3: The wide-band gain Gw and the cross-spectral gain Gcs compared in the double-well

system for a periodic pulse train as input. The standard deviation of the additive input noise is

denoted by σ

The results for the aperiodic signals we were mainly interested in are depicted in Fig

4. In the left panel, we can see that a pulse train made aperiodic by having its peaks at

randomised locations can be improved by stochastic resonance almost to the same extent

as its periodic counterpart. Encouraged by this ﬁnding, we went even further an applied

a band-limited noise with low cut-oﬀ frequency as input signal (to avoid confusion, we use

the terms noise as signal and additive noise to diﬀerentiate between the random process

acting as input signal and the one acting as the stochastic excitation which deﬁnes stochastic

resonance). From the right panel of Fig 4, we can deduce that input-output improvement

is possible even for completely random input signals.

One may argue that the input-output improvement of a noise acting as input signal stems

simply from a ﬁltering eﬀect caused by the fact that the response time of the double well

is limited, preventing high-frequency oscillations from appearing at the output. If this is

the case, the major part of the additive noise gets ﬁltered out while the noise as signal,

having a much lower cut-oﬀ frequency, remains largely intact, which then leads to an input-

output gain. We followed two diﬀerent paths to examine this possibility: ﬁrst, we compared

the results obtained in the double well to those obtained in a non-dynamical stochastic

resonator, the Schmitt trigger, wherein no such ﬁltering can take place; second, we reduced

the bandwidth of the additive noise to get it closer to the bandwidth of the noise as signal.

The data pertaining to the Schmitt trigger come from numerical simulations carried out

with the same parameters as the mixed-signal measurements.

In Fig 5 we can observe the similarity between the results in the double well and those

in the Schmitt trigger, which suggests that the limited response time due to the dynamics

of the double-well system may not play a signiﬁcant role in producing an input-output gain.

Indeed, at low frequencies such as those we have chosen the output of the double well is very

similar to that of the Schmitt trigger.

depicts the maximum of the gain curves as a function of the bandwidth of the additive noise

From the right panel of Fig 4 we can infer that reducing the bandwidth of the additive

noise, while degrading the value of the gain, does not prevent input-output ampliﬁcation

itself. Comparing the right panel of Fig 4 with the left panel of Fig 6, we may also see that

the reduction in the bandwith of the additive noise aﬀects the two systems, the dynamical

and the non-dynamical, in a very similar way, showing that the decrease in the value of the

gain is not a result of a ﬁltering eﬀect. We also examined how the maximum of the gain

depends on the bandwidth of the additive noise: the right panel of Fig 6 shows that input-

output improvement occurs in a very wide additive noise bandwidth range and the value of

a gain only sinks below one for bandwidths that are less than ten times the signal bandwidth

(it is important to note here that a noise bandwidth much greater than the frequency of the

signal is a requirement for stochastic resonance itself to take place).

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Utilising a mixed-signal simulation system, we have demonstrated that the stochastic

resonance occurring in the archetypal double-well model can lead to a signiﬁcant input-

output improvement even for aperiodic signals. We applied two kinds of aperiodic signals, a

randomised pulse train and a band-limited noise as input signal, and using a cross-spectral

measure to reﬂect their noise content both at the input and at the output, we have found

input-output gains well above unity for both types of signals.

10

From a comparison between the dynamical double-well and the non-dynamical Schmitt

trigger, and from studying the dependence of the gain on the bandwidth of the additive

noise, we can conclude that the signiﬁcant signal improvement we have found is not a result

of a ﬁltering eﬀect due to the limited response time inherent in the dynamics of the double

well.

Our results bring about a signiﬁcant extension of the range of signal types which can be

improved by stochastic resonance. Now it is clear that—although the value of the gain may

depend on the type of the input signal—there are no strict requirements for the input signal

to be ampliﬁed by SR: it need not be pulse-like or periodic at all; in fact, even completely

random signals may be improved.

the construction of the most powerful hypothesis test for determining the existence of
a new phenomenon in counting-type experiments where the observed Poisson process
is subject to a Poisson distributed background with unknown mean.

INTRODUCTION

Typical experiments which search for new phenomena such as rare decays (see, for exam-
ple [1]), new particles (see, for example [2]) and astronomical gamma-ray and X-ray sources
(see, for example [3, 7]) are counting-type experiments. In such experiments the number of
observed events is distributed according to a Poisson distribution with some average rate.
Unfortunately, often such experiments are subject to unwanted background, i.e., even if the
new phenomenon is not present, the experiment will register some number of counts with
average background rate. Only in rare cases is the expected background rate known. There-
fore, to overcome this diﬃculty, these experiments typically utilize one of several available
techniques. One of the possibilities is to perform two observations — one for which some of
the observed counts are believed to originate from the new phenomenon and the other for
which all observed counts are known to originate due to background only; all other condi-
tions of the observations are kept intact. Thus, the two observations will yield two observed
counts n1 and n2 made during observation times t1 and t2 respectively. The number of
events n1,2 in each observation is drawn from the corresponding parent Poisson distribution.
If the new phenomenon exists, the observations will come from the Poisson distributions
with diﬀerent average event rates. If, on contrary, the new phenomenon does not exist, the
observations will come from the Poisson distributions with identical average event rates.
When it is not possible to obtain data due to background only or to otherwise determine
the average expected background rate another approach is often used: the ﬁrst observation
is made as before, but the second one is made with the help of computer simulations of
exactly the same experiment with the new phenomenon “turned oﬀ”. In other words, the
observation n1 during time t1 is obtained as in the previous case. The second observation

n2 during time t2 is obtained by simulating the experiment using only the established laws
of physics. Since it is believed that the computer simulation correctly describes the data
collection procedure, n2 can be regarded as drawn from the Poisson distribution with aver-
age background rate. In either case, a decision as to the plausibility of the existence of the
phenomenon is made based on the outcomes of the two observations. Because the outcomes
of the observations represent random numbers drawn from their respective parent distribu-
tions, the question of existence of the new phenomenon is here addressed by a hypothesis
test.

Various statistical tests have been developed which address the question of testing the
hypothesis that two independent observations n1 and n2 made during times t1 and t2 are
due to common background only. The methods, an overview of which can be found in [8],
mostly use Gaussian-type approximations to the Poisson distribution and are not reliable
for small numbers of observed events. In this paper we present the construction of the most
powerful hypothesis test for this situation. That is, we calculate the critical region to be
used which, for any given probability of claiming consistency with background ﬂuctuation
(typically a number such as 10−3 or less), maximizes the probability of detecting a signal.

II. TESTING A STATISTICAL HYPOTHESIS

We begin by reviewing the general procedure of hypotheses tests outlined in [4]. A
statistical hypothesis is a statement concerning the distribution of a random variable Y .1 A
hypothesis test is a rule for accepting or rejecting the hypothesis based on the outcome of
an experiment. The hypothesis being tested, called the null hypothesis H0, is formulated in
such a way that all prior knowledge strongly supports it. The hypothesis is rejected if the

1 The variable Y may be a multidimensional vector. Throughout, we will use capital letters (such as Y ) to

denote random variables and small letters (such as y) to denote their particular realizations.

3

observed value y of the random variable Y lies within a certain critical region w of the space
W of all possible outcomes of Y and accepted or doubted otherwise. It follows, then, that if
there are two tests for the same hypothesis H0, the diﬀerence between them consists in the
diﬀerence in critical regions. It also follows that H0 can be rejected when, in fact, it is true
(error of the ﬁrst kind ); or it can be accepted when some other alternative hypothesis H1 is
true (error of the second kind ). The existence of an alternative hypothesis is clear, otherwise
the null hypothesis would not be questioned. The probabilities of errors of these two kinds
depend on the choice of the critical region. The deﬁnitions are illustrated in ﬁgure 1. Each
probability p(y) of occurrence of every event y is given a subscript corresponding to its
progenitor hypothesis, such as p0(y) for H0. The region to the right of yc is selected to be
the critical one and the two types of errors of the test are marked with diﬀerent hatching.
A critical region is said to be the best critical region for testing hypothesis H0 with regard
to H1 if it is the one which minimizes the probability of the error of the second kind (to accept
H0 when H1 is true) among all regions which give the same ﬁxed value of the probability of
the error of the ﬁrst kind (to reject H0 when it is true). The construction of the best critical
region, resulting in the most powerful test of H0 with regard to H1 was considered in [4]
where the problem is solved for the general case of simple hypotheses. A hypothesis is said
to be simple if it completely speciﬁes the probability of the outcome of the experiment; it
is composite if the probability is given only up to some unspeciﬁed parameters. In general,
if at least one of the hypotheses is composite, the best critical region may not exist [4].

Critical regions w(α) corresponding to diﬀerent probabilities α of errors of the ﬁrst kind
are engineered before the test is performed. When experimental data y is obtained, the
smallest α is found such that y ∈ w(α). It is then said, that the observed experimental data
can be characterized by the p-value equal to α.

The maximum p-value at which the null hypothesis is rejected is called signiﬁcance of
the test and will be denoted as αc. The corresponding critical region will be denoted as
wc = w(αc). The signiﬁcance αc is set in advance, before the test is performed and its choice
is based on the penalty for making the error of the ﬁrst kind. (False scientiﬁc discoveries
should not happen very often, and thus the signiﬁcance is often selected as αc = 10−3.) One
minus the probability of the error of the second kind is called the power of the test which
we denote as (1 − β).

If as the result of the experiment the observed data lies inside of the critical region wc, it is
concluded that the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative one with signiﬁcance
αc and power (1 − β). If, however, the observed data lies outside of the critical region wc,
it is concluded that the null hypothesis is not rejected in favor of the alternative one with
signiﬁcance αc and power (1 − β).

Special consideration must be given to the case of a composite null hypothesis H0 of
the form p0(y; {λ}) with unknown parameters {λ}. Indeed, suppose a critical region w is
if the obtained value of the observable
speciﬁed. Then, it is possible to perform the test:
Y is inside the critical region w, the null hypothesis is rejected, if y 6∈ w, it is accepted.
w p0(y; {λ})dy in general
However, the probability of the error of the ﬁrst kind α({λ}) =
depends on unknown values of parameters {λ} of the null hypothesis. Thus, the p-value α
R
can not be assigned and the conclusion of the test can not be stated. It is therefore desired
to construct such critical regions w, that the probability of the error of the ﬁrst kind does
not depend on the values of unknown parameters. Such regions are called similar to W with
regard to parameters {λ}. A method for construction of such regions was found in [4] under
limited conditions which in the case of one parameter λ are:

4

(1)

• the probability distribution p0(y; λ) is inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable with respect to λ and

• the probability distribution p0(y; λ) is such that if Φ(y) = d log p0

dλ , then

dΦ
dλ

= A + B · Φ

where the coeﬃcients A and B are functions of λ, but are independent of observations
y.

If the above conditions are satisﬁed, critical regions w similar to W with regard to λ are
built up of pieces of the hypersurfaces Φ = const deﬁned by the likelihood ratio p1/p0 > q.

III. NULL HYPOTHESIS BEING TESTED

As was pointed out above, in a typical counting-type experiment two independent obser-
vations yielding two counts n1 and n2 are made during time periods t1 and t2 respectively
with all other conditions being equal. Because it is assumed that each event carries no in-
formation about another, each of the observed counts can be regarded as being drawn from
a Poisson distribution with some value of the parameter. In as much as an attempt is being
made to establish the existence of a new phenomenon, the null hypothesis H0 is formulated
as: n1 and n2 constitute an independent sample of size 2 from a single Poisson distribution
(adjusted for the duration of observation) which is due to a common background with some
unknown count rate λ, or

H0 :

p0(n1, n2) =

(λt1)n1
n1!

(λt2)n2
n2!

e−λ(t1+t2)

The alternative hypothesis is that the two observations are due to Poisson distributions

with diﬀerent unknown count rates λ1 and λ2 respectively (λ1 6= λ2):

H1 :

p1(n1, n2) =

(λ1t1)n1
n1!

e−λ1t1 (λ2t2)n2

e−λ2t2

n2!

The usual physical situation is that one of the count rates is considered to have some
amount due to the new process and the remainder due to the background process [e.g.
λ1 = (λ + λsignal) and λ2 = λ], thus the formulated hypothesis test matches the physical
problem given in the introduction.

It is seen that for the case of interest both hypotheses are of composite type (λ’s are

unspeciﬁed) which complicates the construction of the test.

IV. THE MOST POWERFUL TEST

The formulated probability distribution p0(n1, n2) satisﬁes the conditions of a special case

considered in [4], which facilitates the search for the best critical region in (n1, n2) space.

The probability distribution p0(n1, n2) satisﬁes the following conditions:

• p0(n1, n2) is inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable with respect to λ,

Therefore, the best critical region corresponding to the error of the ﬁrst kind α, deter-
mined from Φ = const, is built up of pieces of the lines nt = n1 + n2 = const. The segments
of each line are those for which the ratio of likelihoods p1/p0 is greater than some constant
qα. This translates to:

incomplete beta function. It must be emphasized that the critical value nα depends on the
parameters λ1,2 of the alternative hypothesis only via the relation λ1 < λ2 or λ1 > λ2. The
best critical region for testing the null hypothesis against the alternative with λ1 6= λ2 does
not exist, but it does exist for testing against λ1 > λ2 or λ1 < λ2 separately, that is when
the signal is a source or a sink respectively. The equations (4) with (2) or (5) with (3)
deﬁne the best critical region w(α) in the space (n1, n2) for testing H0 with regard to H1
(deﬁned for λ1 < λ2 and λ1 > λ2 separately) corresponding to the probability of the error
of the ﬁst kind α. The boundary of this critical region is found by solving the equation (4)
or (5) with respect to nα for all possible values of nt. Owing to the discrete nature of the
observed number of events these equations might not have solutions for the speciﬁed level
of signiﬁcance αc. Nevertheless, it is possible to construct a conservative critical region such
that the probability to observe data within the region does not exceed the preset level αc if
the null hypothesis is true. This is done by requiring:

For the purposes of the hypothesis test itself, equations (4,5) provide the method for the
p-value calculation without the need for solving them. To do this, nt must be set to (n1 + n2)
and nα to n1 then α is computed from the equation (4) or (5). If the obtained p-value α is
not greater than αc the null hypothesis is rejected. This is the uniformly most powerful test
of H0 with regard to H1.

It can be seen that the application of the method of best critical region construction [4] to
the problem of testing whether two observations came from the Poisson distributions with
the same parameter or not have led us to the criterion suggested on intuitive grounds in [6].
The presented discussion, however, shows that it is not possible to construct a better test
for the hypotheses under consideration. The practical use of equations (4,5,6,7) should not
present any diﬃculty using modern computers [5].

V. COMPOUNDING RESULTS OF INDEPENDENT TESTS

It is often the case that the complete data set consists of several runs of the experiment,
each of which belongs to the counting type subjected to Poisson distributed background with
unknown means. The data set is then a set of pairs (n1,r, n2,r) with corresponding durations
of observations (t1,r, t2,r), where subscript r enumerates all the runs of the experiment. Here
we distinguish two cases: ﬁrst where the parameters of both hypotheses do not depend
on the run number r and second where such independence can not be asserted because of

7

r n1,r ≥ nα for the case of λ1 > λ2 or

modiﬁcations made to the apparatus between the runs. In the ﬁrst case it can be seen that
r(n1,r + n2,r) = const,
the critical region must be constructed out of pieces of surfaces nt =
r n1,r ≤ nα for the case of λ1 < λ2.

It is thus seen that equations (4,5) provide a method for the p-value calculation: nt =

hypotheses do not depend on the run number r, the corresponding observations can simply

VI. CONCLUSION

In this paper we have reviewed the basic concepts of statistical hypothesis tests and
underlined the relevant aspects often employed. The diﬃculty arises because frequently
both the null and the alternative hypotheses are of composite type.

We have considered typical counting experiments and constructed the most powerful sta-
tistical test. In doing so, we have insisted on the ability to quantify the error of the ﬁrst kind
although the parameter of the composite null hypothesis is unknown. The test also happens
to be the uniformly most powerful with regard to the composite alternative hypothesis with
λ1 < λ2 or λ1 > λ2 separately. The constructed test is especially important for the case
of small number of events where previously used methods are inadequate because the usual
Gaussian-type approximations break down. Fortuitously, this is the case for which the pro-
posed test can most easily be performed. The existence of the most powerful statistical test
allows comparisons with other computationally less demanding methods to be made which
may be important for some applications.

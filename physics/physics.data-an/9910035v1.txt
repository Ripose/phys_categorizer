Bayesian inference is applied to the level ﬂuctuations of two coupled microwave billiards in order
to extract the coupling strength. The coupled resonators provide a model of a chaotic quantum
system containing two coupled symmetry classes of levels. The number variance is used to quantify
the level ﬂuctuations as a function of the coupling and to construct the conditional probability
distribution of the data. The prior distribution of the coupling parameter is obtained from an
invariance argument on the entropy of the posterior distribution.

I. INTRODUCTION

The subject of the present paper is Bayesian inference
as applied to the experiment of Ref. [1] in order to extract
the mean square matrix element coupling two chaotic
classes of quantum states. The Bayesian procedure de-
scribed below does not contain any arbitrary element:
The prior distribution — sometimes left to the educated
guess of the analyst [2] — is determined by an invariance
argument on the entropy of the posterior distribution.

The present article is organized as follows. In Sec. II,
we brieﬂy describe the experiment with superconducting
microwave resonators that has provided the data for the
present analysis. The random matrix model for the cou-
pling of two symmetry classes of chaotic states is deﬁned
in Sec. III. It yields — in analytic form — the depen-
dence of the observable on the coupling strength which is
to be determined. Bayesian inference, especially the def-
inition of the prior distribution, is discussed in Sec. IV.
The conditional probability distribution of the data is
deﬁned in Sec. V. The results are given in Sec. VI. A
discussion in Sec. VII concludes the paper.

II. THE EXPERIMENT WITH COUPLED
MICROWAVE RESONATORS

Billiards provide models of classical and quantum me-
chanical chaos. They have been studied extensively, see
the review article [3]. Quantum mechanical billiards can
be simulated by ﬂat microwave resonators [4–7]. One
class of these “quantum” billiards are the Bunimovich
stadium billiards [8] experimentally investigated in Refs.
[1,7,9–12].

These investigations show that the ﬂuctuation prop-
erties of the quantum chaotic systems with well deﬁned
symmetries are described by Dyson’s matrix ensembles
[3]. In the case of the stadium billiards, the correct de-
scription is provided by the Gaussian Orthogonal En-
semble (GOE). This means, e.g., that the ﬂuctuations
of the positions of the eigenmodes — shortly the level
ﬂuctuations — are the same as the ﬂuctuations of the

eigenvalues of random matrices drawn from the GOE. In
order to assess these ﬂuctuations, various statistics have
been deﬁned — such as the distance of neighboring levels
or the variance of the number of levels in a given inter-
val. The expectation values of these statistics have been
worked out [13,14] for comparison with data such as the
present ones.

In the previous work [1], the level positions of a system
have been measured that consisted of two (quarters of)
stadium billiards coupled electromagnetically. See Fig. 1.
The technical realization of the coupling has been de-
scribed in Ref. [1].
In the frequency range of 0 to 16
GHz, the complete spectra of the two stadia displayed
608 and 883 resonances in the (γ = 1) stadium and the
(γ = 1.8) stadium, respectively. The mean level spacing
is D = 10.7 MHz.

In Fig. 2, small pieces of spectra are shown for three
diﬀerent couplings. The arrows shall help to recognize
that — due to the coupling — the resonances are shifted
by statistically varying amounts.

This system simulates two symmetry classes of levels
coupled by a symmetry breaking interaction. Each class
of levels — represented by each of the uncoupled stadia
— can be identiﬁed with a chaotic system of well deﬁned
symmetry having the properties of the GOE. The entire
system of the coupled stadia no longer has the universal
properties of the GOE. Its properties are a function of a
suitably deﬁned coupling parameter Λ.

FIG. 1. Shapes of the two coupled stadium billiards. The
circles inside the squares indicate the positions of the anten-
nas used to scatter microwave power through the system in
order to ﬁnd the eigenfrequencies of the entire system. The
parameter γ is the ratio between the length of the rectangular
part and the radius of the circular part of the resonator. The
vertical heights of the stadia are given in Sec. VI.

For α 6= 0, the oﬀ-diagonal matrix V in the second term
on the r.h.s. provides the coupling between both sym-
metry classes. It has Gaussian random elements — as
the GOE blocks. If the two GOE blocks have the same
dimension then their elements as well as the elements of
V shall all have the same rms value. Then α = 1 turns
H as a whole into a GOE matrix [21]. The resulting
spectrum displays what we call 1 GOE behavior. If the
two GOE blocks have diﬀerent dimensions, then the rms
values must be chosen such that their spectra have the
same length. The details are given in [14]. This model
is a special case of the model by Rosenzweig and Porter
[15].

The parameter that governs the level statistics is αv/D
rather than α. Here, D is the mean level distance of H.
See Refs. [14,18]. In the sequel, the coupling parameter

will be used. Often the coupling strength is also
parametrized in terms of the spreading width

The statistic used in the present paper in order to
characterize the behavior of the data, is the so-called Σ2
statistic or number variance. It is the variance z(L) of
the number n(L) of levels found in an interval of length
LD, i.e.

z(L) = h(n(L) − L)2i.

Here, the angular brackets hi denote the average over
all pieces of spectra of length L that have been cut out
of the entire experimental spectrum. The procedure is
described in Sec. V.

The expectation value z(L) with respect to the statis-
tical ensemble deﬁned by Eq. (1) is called Σ2(L, Λ). This
function has been calculated by French et al. [13] and by
Leitner et al. [14]. According to [14], it is

cies — taken at diﬀerent couplings between the two res-

Its
notation (x, y) is explained in Sec. VI. The arrows shall help
to recognize the shifts of a few resonances.

The investigation of symmetry breaking in chaotic
quantum systems is not a recent challenge to physicists
[15]. Good examples of the experimental and theoretical
eﬀorts already invested into this problem, are the cases
of isospin mixing [16–18], of parity violation in heavy
nuclei [19], of the breaking of certain atomic and molecu-
lar symmetries [15,20]. The experiment performed in [1]
provides a general model for these case studies.

In the present paper, we do not describe any one of
the speciﬁc case studies; we shall not even describe in
more detail the model experiment of Ref. [1]. We rather
describe — in the next section — the model experiment
[1] in an abstract mathematical form and then turn to
its analysis in Secs. IV-VII.

III. THE MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF
SYMMETRY BREAKING IN A CHAOTIC
QUANTUM SYSTEM

In the absence of coupling each eigenstate of the system
of Fig. 1 can be characterized as belonging to either res-
onator 1 or resonator 2. This is equivalent to the assign-
ment of a quantum number γ. The spectrum of states of
each γ has the statistical properties of the eigenvalues of
matrices drawn from the GOE. The superposition of the
two spectra displays what we shall call 2 GOE behavior.
It can be described by a block-diagonal Hamilton oper-

2

It describes the 1 GOE behavior. The second term on
the r.h.s. of Eq. (5) obviously vanishes for Λ → ∞.

In Eq. (6), γE is Euler’s constant and Si, Ci are the
sine and cosine integrals deﬁned e.g. in paragraph 8.23 of
[22]. The parameter τ is a function of the ratio between
the dimensions of the two GOE blocks in the ﬁrst term
of Eq. (1). In the present situation, it is equal to 0.74.

The function Σ2 depends on the coupling parameter
Λ — as is illustrated by Fig. 3. Therefore Λ can be in-
ferred from the experimental number variance z(L) . The
principle of this inference is described in the next section.

FIG. 3. The expectation value Σ2(L, Λ) of the number vari-
ance z(L) as a function of L for various coupling strengths Λ
— ranging from 2 GOE to 1 GOE behavior. The abscissa has
been limited to L ≤ 5 because the data analyzed below are in
the range of 1 ≤ L ≤ 5.

IV. BAYESIAN INFERENCE

Suppose that a set of experimental data zk, k = 1...M ,
is given which depends on a parameter Λ in the sense
that the probability distribution wk of the event zk is
conditioned by the hypothesis Λ,

wk = wk(zk | Λ).

(7)

The events zk shall be statistically independent of each
other. The joint distribution W of the zk, k = 1...M , is
then

W (z | Λ) =

wk(zk | Λ).

(8)

M

Yk=1

From this follows the distribution P (Λ | z) of Λ under the
condition that the data z are given via Bayes’ theorem

3

P (Λ | z) =

W (z | Λ) µ(Λ)
m(z)

.

(9)

Here, µ(Λ) is the so-called prior distribution. It is the
measure of integration in the space of Λ. One must de-
ﬁne it such that it represents ignorance on Λ — in a sense
described below. The function m(z) is the prior distri-
bution of z. It is not independent of µ; it is given by the
normalizing integral

m(z) =

dΛ W (z | Λ) µ(Λ).

(10)

Z

In the framework of the logic underlying Eq. (9), a prob-
ability distribution of — say — Λ is considered to rep-
resent the available knowledge on Λ and the prior distri-
bution corresponds to “ignorance about Λ”.

The deﬁnition of µ(Λ) deserves a detailed comment.
First of all, the natural choice of µ(Λ) is not the con-
stant function because a reparametrization Λ → λ(Λ)
will transform µ(Λ) into

µT (λ) = µ(Λ)

(11)

dΛ
dλ

.

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

Unless the transformation is linear, it turns a uniform
distribution into a non-uniform one.

We deﬁne µ(Λ) such that the entropy of P (Λ|z) does
not depend on the true value ˆΛ that governs the distri-
bution of the data z = (z1...zM ). The data follow the
distribution W (z|ˆΛ). Although ˆΛ is not known, it is sup-
posed to be a well deﬁned number.
If it is shifted to
another value ˆΛ′ and one takes new data z′ and con-
structs the posterior distribution P ′ = P (Λ|z′) from the
new data, then one can expect P ′ to be shifted with re-
spect to P . The distribution P ′ will be centered in the
vicinity of ˆΛ′ rather than ˆΛ. However, we want to make
sure that the “spread” of P ′ is the same as that of P ;
that is, the entropy of P and P ′ shall be the same — for
a given number of data M . In this sense, no value of Λ
is a priori preferred over any other one.

The deﬁnition of the entropy requires some attention.
The usual formula −
dΛ P ln P for the entropy is of
too restricted validity in the present context, because
this expression is not invariant under a reparametriza-
tion Λ → λ(Λ). The general expression for the entropy
is

R

H = −

dΛ P (Λ|z) ln

(12)

P (Λ|z)
µ(Λ)

Z

which is independent of a reparametrization [23,24], be-
cause the transformations of both distributions, P and µ,
are performed according to (11). Therefore the deriva-
tive |dΛ/dλ| drops out of the argument of the logarithm
and expression (12) is left unchanged by the substitution
Λ → λ.

It is possible to deﬁne µ such that H is independent of
the true value ˆΛ, if W possesses the property introduced
in [24–26] called form invariance. It states that there is a
group of transformations Gρ such that the simultaneous
transformation of z and Λ leaves W invariant, i.e.

W (Gρz|GρΛ) dGρz = W (z|Λ) dz.

(13)

The group parameter ρ must have the same domain of
deﬁnition as the hypothesis Λ. If one chooses µ(Λ) to be
the invariant measure of the group then it is not diﬃcult
to show that the posterior distribution P also possesses
the invariance (13). This entails that H is invariant un-
der any transformation z → Gρz of the data. However,
by Eq. (13) this is just what happens to a given data set
if the true value ˆΛ is shifted to ˆΛ′ = G−1

ˆΛ.

There is a handy formula that yields the invariant mea-
sure without any study of the structure of the group. It
is

and was proposed by Jeﬀreys [27] even before form in-
variance was discussed.

Not every conditional distribution W possesses a sym-
metry (13). Even if this is not the case, expression (14)
ensures that H is approximately independent of the true
value of Λ. This holds in the following sense: For every ˆΛ
one can replace the correct distribution W (z | Λ) by an
approximation Wapp(z | Λ) which is form invariant. The
approximate and the correct distributions agree within
the fourth order of Λ − ˆΛ. Equation (14) yields the in-
variant measure of the approximation to within the third
order of Λ − ˆΛ [28].

In summary: expression (14) ensures that no value of
Λ is a priori preferred over any other one if the form
invariance (13) exists. If there is no form invariance, ex-
pression (14) approximately ensures this. Therefore (14)
is the best recommendation in any case.

Neither the group theoretic argument nor Jeﬀreys’ rule
nor information theoretic arguments are new in the dis-
cussion of the Bayesian prior. However, the way in which
they are related justiﬁes the present digression on a fun-
damental issue. We omit to show how and why the
present arguments are related to the geometric consid-
erations which were introduced by Amari [29] and are
currently put forward by Rodriguez [30]. These authors
agree on the result (14).

The posterior distribution P is used to construct an
interval of error often called a conﬁdence interval. It is
the shortest interval that contains Λ with probability K.
The usual error is deﬁned with the conﬁdence K = 0.68.
The posterior distribution P approaches a Gaussian
for M → ∞ provided that the true value of Λ is not on
the border of the domain of deﬁnition of Λ. One can
prove that the variance of the Gaussian is proportional
to M −1. Hence, with increasing M the posterior distri-
bution P will become so narrow that µ changes very little

in the domain where P is essentially diﬀerent from zero.
Note that µ does not depend on M . Then µ drops out
of expression (9). If this happens, the present Bayesian
analysis becomes equivalent to a χ2 ﬁt of Σ2(L, Λ) to the
experimental points z(L). The standard procedure of the
χ2 ﬁt can e.g. be found in [31]. It does not require a prior
distribution.

If P is not Gaussian, the χ2 ﬁt yields meaningless con-
ﬁdence intervals. Then Bayesian inference cannot be by-
passed.
In the example presented below this happens
in the limit of small coupling between the resonators:
Eventually, the posterior distribution P decreases mono-
tonically. The experiment is then compatible with zero
coupling because the shortest conﬁdence interval contains
the point Λ = 0 for any K. The point of zero coupling is
on the border of the domain of deﬁnition of Λ.

V. THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE DATA

Spectral ﬂuctuation properties can only be studied af-
ter secular variations of the level density have been re-
moved, i.e. after the frequency scale has been transformed
such that the level density becomes unity within the in-
terval covered by the experiment. This procedure — of-
ten called “unfolding” the spectrum — is a standard one
[32] and has been applied.

After this we deﬁned — for a given interval of length L
— NL adjacent intervals. The intervals did not overlap
and no space was left in between them. This means

NL =

(cid:20)

length of spectrum
L

,

(cid:21)

(15)

where the square brackets designate the largest integer
contained in the fraction. For each interval, the num-
ber n(L) of levels occuring within it was counted and
the squared diﬀerence (n(L) − L)2 was averaged over the
NL intervals. This deﬁnes the average hi introduced in
Eq. (4) and, hence, the “event” z(L). This procedure was
repeated for a set of values Lk, k = 1...M , to be deﬁned
below. In this way, M events

zk ≡ z(Lk)

(16)

were obtained.

The Bayesian procedure outlined in the previous sec-
tion requires that one assigns a probability distribution
wk(zk | Λ) to each event. The zk are statistical quanti-
ties in the following sense: If another spectrum would be
provided that had the same statistical properties as the
measured one and the data zk would be constructed in
the same way as above, they would of course not coincide
with the data obtained from the actually measured spec-
trum — precisely because the levels are subject to statis-
tical ﬂuctuations. If one could go through the ensemble
of spectra in this way, one would obtain an ensemble of

4

data zk. We are looking for the distribution wk of this en-
semble. Since there is only the single measured spectrum
and since no theory yielding wk is available, we have gen-
erated the distribution of zk by Efron’s bootstrap method
[33]. This method generates the distribution numerically
by drawing at random and independently a new set of
NLk intervals from the NLk original intervals. A new zk
is produced from this new set of intervals. Repeating
this many times, a distribution of zk is generated which
is identiﬁed with the distribution wk of the zk. Note that
NLk is always large, namely NLk

>
∼ 300.

For Lk ≥ 1, the distribution wk was in this way found
to be a χ2 distribution with NLk degrees of freedom —
which intuitively seems reasonable. They are close to
Gaussians with variance 2/NLk As mentioned above in
Sec. III, the mean value of this distribution is

zk =

dz z wk(z | Λ)

Z

= Σ2(Lk, Λ).

(17)

Since Σ2 depends on Λ — see Eq. (5) — the distribution
wk depends on Λ.

We have restricted the analysis to Lk ≥ 1. In the do-
main of Lk < 1, the number variance so weakly depends
on the parameter Λ that one does not give away much
information by this restriction.

In order to avoid an unnecessarily complicated distri-
bution of the zk, we want to be sure that there are no
correlations between zk and zk′ , for k 6= k′. It was there-
fore necessary to determine the minimum ǫ of the dis-
tance | Lk − Lk′ | that would still allow for statistically
independent zk, zk′ . Indeed if | Lk − Lk′ | is very small
then most of the intervals associated with Lk will almost
coincide with an interval associated with Lk′ . As a conse-
quence, many of the numbers n(Lk) found in the intervals
associated with Lk will occur also in the intervals asso-
ciated with Lk′ . Hence, zk will not be independent from
zk′ . In order to determine ǫ, we have calculated z(L) as
a function of L in steps of 0.001. For a small range of
L, the result is given in Fig. 4. Indeed over a distance
If
of a few times this step width, z(L) changes little.
| L − L′ | is many times this step width, then z(L) and
z(L′) show independent ﬂuctuations.
In principle, one
can study the decay of the correlations as a function of
| L − L′ | by constructing the autocorrelation function of
z(L). We have contented ourselves to inspect Fig. 4 and
similar plots for diﬀerent domains of L. It seems obvious
from Fig. 4 that the typical width of the structures is less
than 0.025. This justiﬁes to set

ǫ = 0.025,

(18)

FIG. 4. The experimental estimate z(L) of the number
variance — see Eq. (4) — as a function of L calculated in
steps of ∆L = 0.001. The typical width of the structures in
this ﬂuctuating function determines the range ǫ over which
z(L) and z(L + ǫ) may be correlated. Conversely, it serves
to estimate the minimum distance ǫ between L and L′ which
must be respected if z(L) shall not be correlated with z(L′).

There is an upper limit Lmax of L that one must be
aware of: The spectral ﬂuctuations of levels from billiards
agree with those of random matrices — i.e. they are uni-
versal — within intervals of a maximum length which is
inversely proportional to the length of the shortest peri-
odic orbit in the billiard [34,35]. This requires Lmax = 5
here.

Hence, data z(L) for 1 ≤ L ≤ 5 were used to obtain the
results presented below. This means that by Eqs. (18,19)
the number of statistically independent data points is
M = 161.

Let us note that one can devise deﬁnitions of the set of
intervals with given length L other than adjacent inter-
vals — as was done here. One can admit a certain overlap
between them as suggested in [36] or one can place them
at random [37]. We have tried these alternatives and
have made sure that they do not signiﬁcantly change the
results presented below.

Lk = 1 + (k − 1)ǫ,

k = 1, 2, ...M ,

(19)

and to assume that zk is statistically independent of zk′
for k 6= k′.

The data z(Lk), k = 1, ..., 161, are given on Fig. 5 for
the six diﬀerent couplings that were experimentally in-
vestigated. The coupling strength increases from top to
bottom on Fig. 5.
Its experimental realization is indi-
cated by the two numbers (x1, x2) in brackets that label
the six parts of the ﬁgure. They are explained as follows:

5

The billiards were positioned with their ﬂat sides against
each other. Holes were drilled through the walls of the
resonators such that a niobium pin could be inserted per-
pendicularly to the plane of the billiards through the
(γ = 1.8) stadium into the (γ = 1) stadium. The cou-
pling strength is determined by the depths x1 and x2 by
which the niobium pin penetrates into the (γ = 1) and
the (γ = 1.8) stadium, respectively. These depths are
given by (x1, x2) in mm. The net height of the (γ = 1)
stadium was 7 mm and that of the (γ = 1.8) stadium
was 8 mm. For the strongest coupling — i.e. the bottom
part of the ﬁgure — a second niobium pin, penetrating
all the way through both resonators, was added. The
coupling (0,8) — i.e. the top part of the ﬁgure — is the
case, where the billiards should be decoupled.

Prior to the analysis it was therefore not clear whether
the six experimental cases would yield distinguishable
coupling parameters Λ and whether these would even be
distinguishable from zero. The latter question means ac-
cording to Sec. IV: It was not clear whether a χ2 ﬁt would
be appropriate. Therefore the whole analysis was based
on Bayesian inference. The prior distribution was calcu-
lated from (14). The probability distribution wk(zk|Λ)
of the data has been deﬁned in Sec. V. Whether form
invariance exists has not been investigated. The scat-
ter of the data is quite large — especially for L close
to 5. These ﬂuctuations are assessed by the distribution
wk(zk | Λ). The ﬂuctuations increase with increasing L.
This is reﬂected by the fact that wk was found to be a
χ2 distribution with NLk degrees of freedom.
Its rela-
tive rms deviation is
2/NLk and NLk decreases with
increasing Lk, see Eq. (15). Despite the scatter of the
data the coupling parameter is so well determined that
the analysis distinguishes the six experimental cases from
each other — because the number of data points is large
enough.

p

For all cases except coupling (0,8), the posterior distri-
bution (9) turned out to be Gaussian. This is illustrated
on Fig. 6 for the coupling (5,3). In the case of coupling
(0,8) — which is expected to show 2 GOE behavior —
the posterior distribution of Λ is the monotonically de-
creasing function of Fig. 7. This is reasonable because
the shortest conﬁdence interval on Λ will — for any con-
ﬁdence — include the possibility of Λ = 0. Hence, the
distribution of Fig. 7 allows to state only an upper limit
for Λ.

FIG. 5. The number variance z(L) (crosses) and its ex-
pectation value Σ2(L, Λ) (full lines) for various experimental
couplings (x1, x2). The dashed lines display the 2 GOE behav-
ior, i.e. Σ2(L, 0). The dotted lines give the 1 GOE behavior,
i.e. Σ2(L, ∞).

The dashed lines on Fig. 5 illustrate the limiting case of
2 GOE behavior, i.e. expression (5) with Λ = 0. The dot-
ted lines show the limit of 1 GOE behavior, i.e. expression
(6). Obviously, all six cases are not easily distinguished
from the 2 GOE behavior, i.e. Λ = 0.

The results of the Bayesian analysis are summarized in
the ﬁrst ﬁve columns of Table I. The ﬁrst column char-
acterizes the experimental realization of the coupling as
explained above. In the second column, the coupling pa-
rameter Λ is given. It can also be expressed (in the third
column) by the ratio Γ↓/D, see Eq. (3). Alternatively
— see Eq. (2) — the combination αv/D of parameters
of the model of Eq. (1) is given in the fourth column.
By putting D equal to the mean level distance D = 10.7
MHz of the experiment, one obtains in the ﬁfth column
the rms coupling matrix element αv in MHz.

In the case of coupling (0,8), where only an upper limit
for the coupling can be given, we have done so — for the
conﬁdence of 68%. In all other cases the center Λ0 of the
Gaussian posterior is given together with the rms devia-
tion; this deﬁnes a 68% conﬁdence interval.

the table. The sixth column displays the normalized χ2
value. For a reasonable ﬁt, it should lie between 0.84
and 1.16. This follows from the fact that the distribu-
tion of χ2 is here approximately Gaussian with rms value
(2/(number of degrees of freedom))1/2 = (2/160)1/2 ≈
0.16. The seventh column gives the coupling parameters
Λ which the ﬁt has found. They are compatible with the
Bayesian results except for the ﬁrst entry (0,8). Here the
ﬁt puts out a negative value, i.e. it does not produce a
meaningful result. This was expected from the discussion
in Sec. IV.

VII. DISCUSSION

The emphasis of the present paper is on the Bayesian
analysis of the data. Although Bayes’ theorem provides a
clear and simple prescription of how to draw conclusions
from data about a hypothesis conditioning the data, its
use was hampered for a long time by the diﬃculty to de-
ﬁne the prior distribution µ of the hypothesis. Equation
(14) is a very general deﬁnition of µ. It applies even to
cases, where the variable z of the events is discrete (the
integral in (14) then means a sum). The prior distri-
bution (14) ensures that the amount of information one
gets on the hypothesis Λ is — at least approximately —
independent of the true value of Λ.

Supplemented by Eq. (14), Bayes’ theorem provides
the generalization of all methods of inference that rely
on Gaussian approximations. The method of the least
squares e.g. belongs to them. It does not require a prior
distribution of the parameter to be determined. In the
present paper the relation between Bayesian inference
and χ2 ﬁt has been discussed. A criterion has been given
under which Bayesian inference is approximately equiva-
lent to the simpler ﬁt procedure. This criterion has been
substantiated numerically.

The present formalism especially provides the correct
treatment of null-experiments, i.e. of experiments that
yield only an upper limit for the parameter of interest.
An example for this situation has been presented. By
the same token, the formalism of Sec. IV provides the
decision whether the parameter is compatible with zero.
The physical results of the present analysis show that
the strongest coupling realized in the microwave experi-
ment [1] has about the same size as the coupling found
in [18] to occur between states of diﬀerent isospin in

FIG. 7. Posterior distribution for the coupling (0,8), i.e. the
case where the coupling is expected to be zero. The probabil-
ity integrated from Λ = 0 to 0.00085 (marked by an arrow) is
68% .

According to Sec. IV, Gaussian posteriors suggest that
one may replace Bayesian inference by a χ2 ﬁt which
is simpler. A χ2 ﬁt has been performed in all cases
and the results are given in the last two columns of

7

26Al. The strongest coupling treated in the present pa-
per causes about 25% mixing between the two classes of
levels, i.e. a state which can be approximately assigned
to the (γ = 1) stadium contains about 25% strength from
the conﬁgurations of the (γ = 1.8) stadium — and vice
versa. This is the interpretation of the value of Γ↓/D in
Table I. Data that are as numerous and precise as those
of Ref. [1] allow to detect Γ↓/D ten times smaller than
the result of [18] — according to the present analysis.
Nuclear data — which never provide as large a sample
of states as the experiment [1] — would not allow to de-
tect Γ↓/D = 0.07 (the smallest detected mixing in Table
I) from the level ﬂuctuations. The precision obtained in
this experiment has allowed to detect the subtle depen-
dence of the level ﬂuctuations on the breaking of a sym-
metry which is predicted by the random matrix model
[18,13,14].

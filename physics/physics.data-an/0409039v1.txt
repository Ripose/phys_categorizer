CALORIMETER CLUSTERING WITH MINIMAL SPANNING

We present a top-down approach to calorimeter clustering. An algorithm based on
minimal spanning tree theory is described brieﬂy.

1 Introduction

Clustering calorimeter hits is a complex pattern recognition problem with com-
plexity depending on event type, energy and detector design. A successful clus-
tering algorithm must be characterised by high eﬃciency and speed to cope
with and to exploit the high granularity design forseen for both electromag-
netic and hadronic calorimeters in a Future Linear Collider experiment. In the
following we describe a top-down or divisive hierarchical clustering approach
where the entire set of hits is ﬁrst considered to be a single cluster, the minimal
spanning tree, which is then broken down into smaller clusters.

2 Clustering With Minimal Spanning Trees

Given a set of nodes in a conﬁguration space and a metric to assign distance
cost or weight to each edge connecting a pair of nodes, we deﬁne the minimal
spanning tree as the tree which contains all nodes with no circuits and of which
the sum of weights of its edges is minimum (see Fig. 1). A minimal spanning
tree is unique for the given set of nodes and the chosen metric, it is deterministic
i.e. it has no dependency on random choices of nodes during construction, and
it is invariant under similarity transformations that preserve the monotony of
the metric [1]. First developed and applied to problems related to eﬃcient
design of networks [2], minimal spanning trees are well studied mathematical
objects and there is a solid base of theorems which relate them to eﬃcient
clustering as well [1]. Applications to high energy physics can be found in [3].
A clustering algorithm based on minimal spanning trees has been devel-
oped. It can operate standalone or perform preclustering before a sophisticated
energy-ﬂow algorithm is applied [4]. Its operation is divided into three consec-
utive steps. First an appropriate metric, not necessarily euclidean, should be
deﬁned. Then the corresponding minimal spanning tree is constructed using
Prim’s algorithm [2]. The ﬁnal step is to perform single linkage cluster analysis
i.e. go through the tree and cut the branches with length above a proximity

bound that the nodes belonging to the same cluster must obey. The algorithm
is an O(N 2) loop, where N is the number of nodes. Also it should be empha-
sized that after deﬁning an appropriate metric for the problem the rest of the
algorithm has no dependency on detector geometry since only the metric deals
with this. First tests of the algorithm with single and multiparticle events
show satisfactory performance. A simple example is depicted in Fig 2.

We have discussed a top-down approach to calorimeter clustering based on
minimal spanning trees, highlighting in brief their theoretical background and
implementation in a clustering algorithm.

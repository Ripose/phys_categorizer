An objective change-point analysis of historical Atlantic
hurricane numbers

Abstract

We perform an objective change-point analysis on 106 years of historical hurricane number data.
The algorithm we use looks at all possible combinations of change-points and compares them in terms
of the variances of the diﬀerences between real and modelled numbers. Overﬁtting is avoided by using
cross-validation. We identify four change-points, and show that the presence of temporal structure
in the hurricane number time series is highly statistically signiﬁcant.

1 Introduction

Several severe hurricanes made landfall on the US coastline during 2004 and 2005, and this has increased
the level of interest in questions related to long-term ﬂuctuations in the levels of hurricane activity. One
way to contribute to an overall understanding of hurricane activity levels is to analyse the historical
hurricane record statistically, and over the years this has been attempted by a number of authors (for
example, see Goldenberg et al. (2001), Elsner et al. (2000) and Elsner et al. (2004)). The main questions
that are typically considered are: is the record stationary, and if not, what does the variability look like?
A number of studies have concluded that the record is not stationary, and that there are periods of high
and low levels of activity, although the precise causes of these ﬂuctuations are not agreed upon in detail.
Exactly when the periods of high and low activity start and end, and how to identify these start and
end points, is also not exactly clear. In Elsner et al. (2000), a change-point scheme based on log-linear
regression was used to examine the major Atlantic hurricane time series. In Elsner et al. (2004) a change-
point analysis based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach (Lavielle and Labarbier, 2001) is used to
analyse both basin-wide Atlantic hurricane activity and US landfalling rates. While our primary interest
in this article is Atlantic activity, we note that a number of studies have analysed various Paciﬁc tropical-
cyclone time series using log-linear regression and Bayesian techniques (Chu, 2002; Chu and Zhao, 2004;
Zhao and Chu, 2006).
In this paper we revisit the question of how to detect change-points in Atlantic hurricane activity: our
contribution is to use what we consider to be better statistical methods for the identiﬁcation of periods
of high and low activity than have been used before. We think that the methods we use are more or less
the best that one can hope to do: we look at all possible combinations of diﬀerent positions for changes in
the level of activity, and compare the resulting models using cross-validation to avoid overﬁtting. These
methods are now possible because of recent increases in available computer power.

2 Methods

Our method for identifying diﬀerent levels of activity in the historical hurricane data works as follows.
For data, we take the numbers of Atlantic hurricanes per year as reported in the current version of the
HURDAT database (Jarvinen et al., 1984). This data runs from 1869 to 2005, although we only consider
data from 1900 to 2005 because of doubts about the completeness of the data prior to 1900. The data
from 1900 to 2005 is shown in ﬁgure 1. One might also have doubts about the data for the period 1900-
1949, prior to the use of aerial reconnaissance: however, we analyse the data as-is. All of our conclusions
must be considered with this in mind.

We model this series of hurricane numbers using sequences of levels of constant hurricane activity, plus
noise. Initially we model the series as a simple constant level, with no change-points, then using two
constant levels, with a single change-point. For all possible positions of this single change-point we
calculate the predictive mean square error (MSE) and we consider the best model to be that which
minimises this MSE score. We say predictive mean square error because we calculate the MSE using
cross-validation, thus avoiding overﬁtting. Not using cross-validation would unfairly favour the selection
of small gaps between change-points.
We then increase the number of possible change-points and repeat this exercise. As the number of change-
points is increased one might expect the MSE results to improve, as we model the real ﬂuctuations in
the series, but then at some point one might expect the MSE results to get worse, as the model becomes
overﬁtted. The model we choose is the one with lowest MSE.
The only parameter in the model is the minimum gap between change-points. We start by trying a gap
of 2 years, and then increase the gap to 10 years, for reasons discussed below.

3 Results: 2 year minimum gap

We ﬁrst consider results from our change-point analysis for when the minimum gap between change-points
is set to two years. Table 1 shows the change-points identiﬁed in this case, for models with numbers of
change-points increasing from 0 (1 level) to 7 (8 levels). ‘48’ in this table indicates that a change-point has
been identiﬁed between 1947 and 1948. Table 2 shows the predictive RMSE scores for these models, and
table 3 shows the number of combinations of change-points tested in each case. The predictive RMSE
scores decrease as the number of levels increases, right up to the last case tested, which has 8 levels
and 7 change-points. From table 3 we see that testing 8 levels requires consideration of over 50 trillion
combinations, and this reaches the limit of our computing power. We cannot claim, therefore, that we
have been able to ﬁnd the best model, since there might be a better model with 9 levels (or even more
than 9 levels). The change-points detected in the 8 level case show an interesting distribution in time,
with small gaps between several of the pairs (in spite of the fact that we are using cross-validation). The
change-points identiﬁed in the 8 level model are depicted in ﬁgure 2, against the hurricane time series
data. Overall the results suggest that the hurricane number time series is not stationary, and that the
underlying rate undergoes ﬂuctuations on a range of timescales.
At this point we are forced to conclude that our 2-year minimum gap analysis has failed because we have
been unable to identify a global minimum in our cost function for lack of computer power. For many
purposes, however, we are less interested in identifying very short time-scale ﬂuctuations in hurricane
rates than we are in understanding longer time-scale ﬂuctuations. For this reason, we now increase the
minimum gap allowed from 2 years to 10 years, in order to focus on ﬂuctuations on decadal and longer
timescales.

4 Results: 10 year minimum gap

We now consider results from our change-point analysis for when the minimum gap between change-
points is set to ten years. Tables 4, 5 and 6 show the change-points, scores and numbers of combinations
considered in this case. Looking at the scores, we now see that we reach a minimum RMSE score for 5
levels and 4 change-points. For a greater number of levels the RMSE increases, indicating that the model
then starts to become overﬁtted relative to the 4 change-point model. We illustrate the change-points for
the cases with 2 to 5 levels, from ﬁgure 3 onwards. In each case we also show the change-points for all of
the top 30 combinations identiﬁed, which gives some idea of the robustness of the results. Interestingly
for the 5 level case the change-points seem to be very robust, and very similar sets of change-points occur
several times in the top 30 results.

5 Signiﬁcance testing

Could these results have occurred if the data were purely random? We test this as follows. We take the
historical hurricane number data used in our change-point analysis, and create 100 random reorderings.
Each of these reordered time-series has the same marginal distribution as the original data, but diﬀerent
temporal structure. We then apply our change-point algorithm to each of these 100 series. The results
are as follows. With respect to the number of change-points we identify (by the ﬁrst minimum in the
series of RMSE values): on average, we ﬁnd 4.5 change-points, with a range from 2 to 7. This tells us

that the fact that we have identiﬁed 4 change-points in the real series is not itself an indication of real
temporal structure. With respect to the RMSE values achieved: the average of the 100 minimum RMSE
values achieved is 2.60, while the lowest of the 100 values is 2.41. This is larger than the value achieved
from the real data, which is 2.31. This shows, with a high level of certainty, that the RMSE score result
for 4 change-points from the real data could not have occurred from random data, and is very strong
evidence that there is real temporal structure in the hurricane number time-series. We note, however,
that we have not proven that the change-points we have identiﬁed are deﬁnitely right, or even statistically
signiﬁcant, on an individual basis. Many of the individual combinations of change-points we have tested
are statistically signiﬁcant, but the diﬀerences between them are not. All we can say for sure is:

• we have proven that there is decadal time-scale variability in the time-series

• that the best way to approximate that variability, within the class of models we have considered,

is given by the change-points that we have detected

• if one has to choose one set of change-points, the change-points we have detected are probably the

best set to choose

6 Intense hurricanes

Up to now our analysis has focussed on the identiﬁcation of change-points in the time-series of the total
number of hurricanes. However, Elsner et al. (2000) and Elsner et al. (2004) consider only the intense
hurricanes (Category 3-5 on the Saﬃr-Simpson scale). It is therefore of interest to run our new algorithm
on the intense hurricanes only, to understand whether the diﬀerences between our results and those of
Elsner are mainly a result of using a diﬀerent data set (all storms versus cat 3-5 storms) or because
we use a diﬀerent algorithm. Figure 11 shows the time-series of intense hurricane numbers. By eye,
the change-points look more signiﬁcant than those in the time-series of all hurricane numbers shown in
ﬁgure 1. Tables 7 and 8 show the change-points and scores for our analysis of the intense hurricane
number time-series, with a minimum window width of 10 years, as before. We see that the lowest score
is once again at 4 change-points (5 levels). Relative to the change-points we identiﬁed in the basin series,
two are exactly the same (48 and 95), one has ‘moved’ a little (70 to 65), and one has changed (32
to 15). We note that for the same time series, Elsner et al. (2000) and Elsner et al. (2004) identify 3
change-points, at 43, 65 and 95. Our analysis identiﬁes 2 identical change-points (65 and 95), and 1
that is close (43 for Elsner et al. versus 48 in our analysis). Our analysis has revealed an additional
change-point at 1915, presumably because we are using a diﬀerent search algorithm, although because of
uncertainty in the earlier data one must have signiﬁcant doubts as to whether this change-point has any
physical signiﬁcance. By and large, our analyses for major hurricanes is very similar to previous studies.
Our conclusions from the comparison between our results for cat 1-5 and cat 3-5 hurricanes and the
results in Elsner et al. (2000) for cat 3-5 hurricanes are that (a) the change-point in 1994/1995 is robust
to changing between cat 1-5 and cat 3-5 , and to changing detection methods, (b) the 1964/1965-1969/1970
change-point occurs in 1969/1970 for cat 1-5 data and in 1964/1965 for cat 3-5 data. In the cat 3-5 data
it is robust to the use of diﬀerent detection methods, (c) the change-points earlier in the century are not
robust to the use of diﬀerent detection methods.

7 Discussion

We have completed a new change-point analysis of the hurricane number time series from 1900 to 2005.
We consider the method that we have used to be close to being the best that one could possibly do,
since we consider all possible combinations of change-points. The method also has the advantage that it
is conceptually very simple. The only disadvantage is that a vast number of computations are required.
The one parameter in the model is the minimum gap allowed between change-points. Setting this to
2 years makes the problem computationally unfeasible for us, since we don’t ﬁnd an optimum solution
before the number of combinations becomes too large to search in a reasonable time on our computer.
Increasing the parameter to 10 years, and thus focussing on ﬂuctuations on time-scales of decades and
longer, reduces the number of combinations and turns out to be computationally tractable. We ﬁnd that
the absolute global optimum solution to this problem has 4 change-points and 5 diﬀerent levels. The
change-points occur at 1931/1932, 1947/1948, 1969/1970 and 1994/1995.
When we reapply the method to intense hurricanes only we again ﬁnd an absolute global optimum solution
with 4 change-points and 5 diﬀerent levels. Two of the change-points are the same as for the total

hurricane number series (1947/1948 and 1994/1995), one has moved a little earlier (1969/1970 becomes
1964/1965) and one has changed (1931/1932 becomes 1914/1915). This ﬁnal change-point should be
viewed with a lot of suspicion, however, since the data is considered rather unreliable this early in the
century. The two most recent change-points we have found in the intense time-series agree exactly with
the two most recent change-points found in earlier work (using a diﬀerent algorithm) by Elsner et al.
in the intense time-series, at least, one can more or less
(2000). This is perhaps not that surprising:
identify the change-points by eye.
This study is our ﬁrst attempt at looking at change-points in the hurricane number time series. There
are various directions in which we plan to take this research, such as considering a probabilistic cost
function, applying the same analysis to landfalling hurricane numbers, and using the results to predict
future levels of hurricane activity.

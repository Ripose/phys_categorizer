Lagrangian Velocity Correlations and Absolute Dispersion in the
Midlatitude Troposphere

Jai Sukhatme
Advanced Study Program, National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, CO

February 9, 2014

Employing daily wind data from the ECMWF, we perform passive particle advection to estimate
the Lagrangian velocity correlation functions (LVCF) associated with the midlatitude tropospheric
ﬂow. In particular we decompose the velocity ﬁeld into time mean and transient (or eddy) com-
ponents to better understand the nature of the LVCF’s. A closely related quantity, the absolute
dispersion (AD) is also examined.

Given the anisotropy of the ﬂow, meridional and zonal characteristics are considered separately.
The zonal LVCF is seen to be non-exponential. In fact, for a broad set of intermediate timescales
it is better described as a power law of the form τ −α with 0 < α < 1. Indeed, the implied long
time correlation in the zonal ﬂow results in a superdiﬀusive zonal AD regime. On the other hand,
the meridional LVCF decays rapidly to zero. Interestingly, before approaching to zero it shows a
region of negative correlation. A physical argument based on the rotational inhibition of latitudinal
excursions, mediated through the time mean ﬂow, is put forth to account for this anticorrelation.
As a result the meridional AD, apart from showing the classical asymptotic ballistic and diﬀusive
regimes, displays transient subdiﬀusive behaviour.

1. Introduction

Being a quantity of fundamental interest in the statistical characterization of a turbulent ﬂow, the
Lagrangian velocity correlation function (LVCF) has been the subject of detailed study1,2. Indeed,
if we view the midlatitude free troposphere to be in a non-ideal turbulent state3,4, it is of natural
interest inquire into the nature its LVCF. Similarly, apart from being a measure of transport and
its close relation to the LVCF5,2, the absolute dispersion (AD) is known to yield information about
the structure of the underlying ﬂow6,7,8.

Our approach is slightly diﬀerent from earlier modelling studies of large scale atmospheric disper-
sion which employ a Langevin equation, equivalently assuming an exponential LVCF, to parameterize
the dispersion process9,10 (a critical discussion of such an approach can be found in11). Here, apart
from computing the aforementioned Lagrangian statistics, we wish to compare and contrast them
with existing results on ideal 2D12,13, (quasi) geostrophic14,15 and 3D16,17 turbulent ﬁelds.

For computational purposes, daily pressure level wind data from the ECMWF is used as the 3D
advecting velocity ﬁeld. We computed the trajectories (and record the velocity along these trajec-
tories) of an ensemble of passive particles (denoted by S) 1. All statistical quantities presented are
averages over S and computations are done with data from both the winter (DJF) and summer
(JJA) seasons of 1990.

1The trajectories were computed in latitude, longitude and pressure coordinates by a standard fourth order
Runge-Kutta scheme and the velocity ﬁelds were interpolated in a linear fashion.

2. Lagrangian Velocity Correlation Functiuons

A. Zonal LVCF

Denoting the zonal velocity by u(λ, φ, p, t), the zonal LVCF (Ru(τ )) is deﬁned as

Ru(τ ) =

< u(~x(t + τ )) u(~x(t)) >S
< u(~x(t))2 >S

(1)

Here ~x(t) represents the trajectory of an individual member of S. To account for the inhomogene-
ity of the ﬂow and to focus our attention the midlatitudes, S is chosen to comprise of N mem-
bers located randomly such that they initially satisfy 0◦ < λ(S) < 360◦, 35◦ ≤ φ(S) ≤ 55◦ and
400mb ≤ p(S) ≤ 700mb, where λ, φ, p represent the longitude, latitude and pressure coordinates.

As can be seen in the upper panel of Fig. 1, which shows log[Ru(τ )] for the winter and sum-
mer seasons, the zonal LVCF is clearly non-exponential. This is in agreement with studies on
2D12 and geostrophic14 turbulence, but stands in contrast to recent laboratory investigations of 3D
turbulence16. Note that it is possible to characterize Ru(τ ) as an exponential for small τ i.e. τ ≤ 2
days 2. However, for intermediate values of τ (i.e. 2 < τ < 10 days), which will prove to be of signif-
icance later on, we observe (lower panel of Fig. 1) Ru(τ ) ∼ τ −α with 0 < α < 1 (α = 0.32 and 0.45
for DJF and JJA respectively). Physically, the presence of such power laws is known to enhance
the Lagrangian correlation time7 (Tu =
Ru(t)dt) implying persistent correlations in the zonal
velocity ﬁeld.

B. Meridional LVCF

Deﬁned in a manner similar to Eq. (1), but using the meridional component of the velocity ﬁeld
(v(λ, φ, p, t)) we compute the meridional LVCF (Rv(τ )). As is seen in Fig. 2, Rv(τ ) decays to zero
in one week. Interestingly, we notice a pronounced anticorrelation, i.e. Rv(τ ) < 0 before the ﬁnal
Rv(τ ) → 0 behaviour. On comparison with 2D12 and geostrophic turbulence14 we ﬁnd this feature
to be unique to the present situation. Indeed, this is easily explained when one considers the physical
restriction imposed by the rotation of the planet. Speciﬁcally, in the absence of strong diabatic or
frictional eﬀects, the conservation of potential vorticity inhibits the large latitudinal migration of
parcels18. In fact, the restoring force provided by the variation in planetary vorticity gives rise to
large scale stationary Rossby waves19. Based on this we argue that the tendency of parcels to return
to their latitude of origin, as mediated by the time mean ﬂow is responsible for the anticorrelation
seen in Rv(τ ).

In the context of scalar transport, this phenomenon i.e. R(τ ) < 0 before R(τ ) → 0, has been
observed in studies of diﬀusive interference20 as well as in transport through porus media21. In the
former, the advecting ﬂow is constructed from a superposition of a (slow) large scale recirculation

2Indeed, a representation of the velocity ﬁeld as the sum of two Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes which
decorrelate with diﬀerent timescales has been proposed as an eﬀective parameterization in 2D turbulence12.

with (fast) exponentially decorrelating colored noise20. A subtle, though important distinction be-
tween this and the present situation is that, in the present situation the ”recirculation” is an inherent
mechanism due to the underlying dynamics. Whereas in the interference studies, the recirculation
arises due to geometric constraints on the domain. On the other hand, in studies of porus media
the velocity ﬁelds are random shear ﬂows - in particular for some special cases it is possible to
analytically calculate the LCVF and isolate the above mentioned anticorrelation phenomenon22.

C. Eddy and Time Mean LVCF’s

To gain a deeper insight into the connection between the nature of the LVCF’s and the structure of
the tropospheric ﬂow, we partition the daily data into time mean and transient components. Specif-
T u(~x, t)dt (where T is the duration of the entire season) and
ically, the time mean is ˆu(~x) = (1/T )
0
the transient or eddy component is deﬁned as u′(~x, t) = u(~x, t)− ˆu(~x). Even though the tropospheric
R
ﬂow does not posses a clear spectral gap, i.e. there is a near continuum of active (temporal and
spatial) scales, we expect the above decomposition to separate processes which vary on scales that
are farthest apart23.

Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 show the zonal and meridional LVCF’s computed by exculsively utilizing the
time mean (upper panels) and eddy ﬁelds (lower panels). In spite of the crudeness of our partition,
the similarity between the eddy LVCF’s in both cases is evident. Indeed, apart from the slight anti-
correlation retained in the meridional eddy LCVF, both Ru′ (τ ) and Rv′ (τ ) resemble exponentially
decaying functions.

On the other hand the zonal and meridional time mean LVCF’s are strikingly diﬀerent. Where
Rˆu(τ ) decorrelates on long timescales - something we would expect from a slowly varying zonal jet
- Rˆv(τ ) resembles oscillatory motion as induced by a large scale wave. Moreover, comparing the
behaviour of Rv′ (τ ) and Rˆv(τ ) supports our attribution of the anticorrelation observed in Rv(τ ) to
the time mean component of the ﬂow.

3. Absolute Dispersion

The absolute dispersion (AD) is deﬁned as,

AD(t) =< (x(t) − x(0))2 >S

(2)

(3)

For ideal (i.e. isotropic, homogenous, stationary and zero time mean) ﬂows, we have5,2,

AD(t) = 4E

τ → 0) of the above yields ballistic motion whereas when Tu is ﬁ-
The short time limit (i.e.
τ >> Tu) yields diﬀusive behaviour1. The presence of other
nite, the long time limit (i.e.
exponents, i.e. AD(t) ∼ tγ ; γ 6= 1, is referred to as anomalous diﬀusion6. Before display-
i.e. A(t) =<
let us ﬁx some notation. We denote the total AD by A(t),
ing the results,
(x(t) − x(0))2 + (y(t) − y(0))2 + (z(t) − z(0))2 >S, where x, y, z are cartesian coordinates. Fur-
ther the individual components of the AD are denoted by Ai(t) where i represents a coordinate, for
eg. Ax(t) =< (x(t) − x(0))2 >S.

From Eq. (3) we have R(τ ) ∼ τ −α ⇒ AD(t) ∼ t2−α. Even though the non-ideal nature of the
present ﬂow, especially its rich time mean structure3,4, is likely to invalidate the direct applicability

3

of Eq. (3) - nonetheless, from the power law form of Ru(τ ) it is reasonable to expect the zonal AD
to exhibit anomalous behaviour at intermediate timescales. Indeed as can be seen in Fig. 5 (which
shows Ax(t)) 3,

Ax(t) ∼ t2

0 < t ≤ 2

Ax(t) ∼ tγ ; γ = 1.45 2 < t ≤ 8 [Anomalous : Superdiﬀusive]

e ; Re = Earth Radius

t > 8

[Saturation]

In order to avoid the eﬀective boundedness of the domain we unwrap the longitude and present
Aλ(t) in Fig. 6. Now the anomalous regime (tδ ; δ = 1.6) lasts from T1 < t < T2 days (T1 ∼ 2
and T2 ∼ 25), after which we see the beginning of an asymptotic diﬀusive regime (lower panel of
Fig. 4) 4. It is worth mentioning that the anomalous behaviour of Aλ(t) is in close agreement with
laboratory experiments on QG turbulence24.

Regarding the meridional AD, apart from the initial ballistic behaviour we expect to see normal
diﬀusion at large t, as Rv → 0 quite rapidly. Once again, we use Eq. (3) to get a feel for the
meridional AD at intermediate timescales. Qualitatively approximating Rv(τ ) ∼ e−τ /C1 cos(ωτ )
(Fig. 2), numerical integration of Eq. (3) yields the AD shown in Fig. 7. Interestingly, apart from
the two asymptotic regimes we notice transient subdiﬀusive scaling. This is in accord with results
utilizing random shear ﬂows, where anticorrelation in the LCVF was associated with subdiﬀusion
and even complete trapping in extreme cases22. Indeed the actual meridional AD, Az(t) shown in
Fig. 8, behaves in precisely the same manner,

Az(t) ∼ t2

0 < t ≤ 2 [Ballistic]

Such superdiﬀusive zonal and subdiﬀusive meridional behaviour has also been recently observed
in a study of anisotropic drift-wave turbulence25 - particularly remarkable is the similarity of the
anomalous exponents in the two situations.

4. Summary

Employing daily wind data from the ECMWF, we have estimated the zonal and meridional LVCF’s
of the midlatitude tropospheric ﬂow. The zonal LVCF is seen to be non-exponential in character.
Physically, given that the midlatitude tropospheric ﬂow has a rich time mean structure along with an

3Ay(t) is virtually identical to Ax(t). Also, Az(t) (shown later ) << Ax(t) hence A(t) also behaves in the
same fashion as Ax(t).

4Note that we should expect δ 6= γ as Aλ(t) only involves changes in λ whereas Ax(t) is sensetive to both
λ and φ.

energetic eddy ﬁeld3,4 - this observation is not entirely unexpected. Moreover, from this perspective
our examination of Rˆu(τ ) and Ru′ (τ ) serves to clarify the roles of the time mean and eddy ﬁelds
respectively. Speciﬁcally, the eddy ﬁeld by itself generates an almost exponential rapidly decaying
LCVF whereas the time mean component - roughly a slowly varying unidirectional jet ﬂow23 - is
seen to be strongly correlated.

Apart from decaying to zero in a relatively short time (≈ 1 week), the meridional LVCF exhibits
a pronounced anticorrelation - i.e. Rv(τ ) < 0 before Rv(τ ) → 0. We attribute this anticorrelation
to the dynamical ”recirculation” induced by large scale planetary waves - a basic consequence of
PV conservation on a rotating planet. Examining Rv′ (τ ) we see that the meridional eddy LCVF is
very similar to its zonal counterpart. Whereas Rˆv(τ ) - a manifestation of the large scale stationary
waves - has a strongly oscillatory character and shows the time mean component to be responsible
for the above mentioned anticorrelation in Rv(τ ).

As regards the AD, the point that stands out is the superdiﬀusive and subdiﬀusive anomalous
scaling in the zonal and meridional directions respectively. Given that similar behaviour has been
observed in drift wave turbulence25, we are led to speculate on the possible universality of this
phenomenon in ﬁelds where (slow) jets and waves co-exist with (fast) eddies.

Radar equations in the problem of radio wave
backscattering during bistatic soundings

O.I.Berngardt, A.P.Potekhin

January 3, 2014

Abstract

This paper outlines a method of obtaining the relation between
the singly scattered signal and the Fourier-spectrum of medium di-
electric permititvity ﬂuctuations, with due regard for the fact that
the scattering volume is determined by antenna patterns and is not
small. On the basis of this equation we obtained the radar equa-
tion relating the scattered signal spectrum to the spatial spectrum of
ﬂuctuations. Also, a statistical radar equation is obtained, which re-
lates the mean statistical power of the scattered signal to the spectral
density of the dielectric permitivity ﬂuctuations without a classical
approximation of the smallness of the irregularities spatial correlation
radius. The work deals with the bistatic sounding case, when the ex-
act forward and exact backward scattering are absent, and sounding
signal have suﬃciently norrow spectral band for scattered volume to
change slowly on ranges of Fresnel radius order. The statistical radar
equations obtained diﬀers from the classical ones in the presence the
coherent structures with big correlation radii, and so the received sig-
nal spectrum can diﬀer from intrinsic spectrum of irregularities.

1 Introduction

The method of radio wave backscattering due to dielectric permitivity ﬂuc-
tuations of the medium provides the basis for a wide variety of techniques
for probing the ionosphere (the radio waves incoherent scattering method

1

[Kofman,1997], scattering from artiﬁcial irregularities[Belikovich et al.,1986]),
the atmosphere (mesospheric- stratospheric-tropospheric sounding [Woodman,1989]),
and other media. Central to these techniques is the radar equation that
relates the mean spectral power of the scattered signal to the statistical
characteristic of the meduium dielectric permitivity ﬂuctuations, their spec-
tral density [Tatarsky,1967], [Woodman,1989], [Ishimaru,1981]. A standard
method for constructing the statistical radar equation involves construct-
ing the spectral power (or an received signal autocorrelation function) using
two approximations. One of them, viz.
the single-scattering approxima-
tion, is applicable when the dielectric permitivity ﬂuctuations are weak and
the scattered ﬁeld is signiﬁcantly weaker than the incident ﬁeld. The other
approximation is the approximation of the irregularities spatial correlation
radius smallness in comparison with the Fresnel radius.

The single scattering problem of the electromagnetic wave has been rea-
sonably well-studied in situations were the receiver and the transmitter are
in the far-ﬁeld region of the scatterer.
In this case it is possible to ob-
tain a simple linear relation between the scattered signal and the spatial
Fourier-spectrum of irregularities without recourse to a statistical averaging
[Newton,1969], [Ishimaru,1981]. However, in remote diagnostics of media,
the scattering volume size is determined by the antenna patterns crossing.
Hence it is impossible to use a classical approximation of the sounding volume
smallness[Ishimaru,1981] to obtain the radar equation relating the scattered
signal to the Fourier-spectrum of dielectric permitivity ﬂuctuations. There-
fore, when obtaining the statistical radar equation, one has to average the
received signal power and to use the approximation of the spatial correlation
radius smallness, which makes it possible to generalize results derived from
solving a classical problem of wave scattering from a single small irregularity
to the problem of scattering from a set of uncorrelated small irregularities
[Tatarsky,1967],[Ishimaru,1981].

Here we have obtained the radar equation relating the scattered signal
spectrum to the spatial spectrum of dielectric permitivity ﬂuctuations for
bistatic sounding. This expression was obtained without a traditional limi-
tation on the smallness of the scattering volume size and describes essentially
the scattering from an extended scatterer. An analysis of the expression re-
vealed a selectivity of the scattering similar to the widely-known Wolf-Bragg
condition.

We obtained the statistical radar equation for bistatic sounding which

2

relates the scattered signal mean power to the dielectric permitivity ﬂuctu-
ations spectral density without a classical approximation of the spatial cor-
relation radius smallness. This equation has a more extensive validity range
when compared to the well-known equation [Tatarsky,1967],[Ishimaru,1981],
obtained by assuming the smallness of the irregularities spatial correlation
radii.

There were pointed out earlier [Doviak and Zrnic’,1984] there is diﬃcul-
ties in obtaining the equation for correlation radii or scattering volume big-
ger than Fresnel radius without exact antenna patterns, irregularities and
sounder signals. The suggested method do not contain those limitations.

2 Starting equation

Consider a bistatic sounding within the single-scattering approximation. We
use, as the starting equation, the well-known expression for a complex enve-
lope of the received signal [Tatarsky,1967][Ishimaru,1981] (accurate to terms
unimportant for the subsequent discussion):

Equation (1) deﬁnes the relation between the received signal and medium
ﬂuctuations and is essentially (in the sounding problem) the radar equation
for signals unlike the classical one for power characteristics. The kernel H
and the beam factor g are determined by transmitting and receiving system
parameters. Speciﬁcally, the kernel H determines the region of ﬂuctuations
ǫ over time and space which contributes to the scattered signal. The beam
factor g determines the region of space which contributes to the scattered
signal.

3 Relation of the scattered signal to the spa-
tial Fourier-spectrum of irregularities.

3.1 Derivation of radar equations.

This section discusses the method of obtaining the relation between the scat-
tere signal spectrum and the spatial spectrum of the medium dielectric permi-
tivity ﬂuctuations. The problem of obtaining a relation for the case of small
scatterers was considered in [Newton,1969]; in this paper we have obtained
a relation without a limitation on the size of the object being probed. The
main idea of this method is the transition from the problem of scattering on
spatial irregularities to the scattering on separate spatial Fourier-harmonics
of these irregularities. Their respective contributions are calculated by the
stationary-phase method and are summarized.

Let us analyze the expression (1), without performing a standard [Tatarsky,1967]

[Ishimaru,1981] transition to quadratic (in ﬁeld) characteristics. Within
Born’s approximation, the main physical mechanism for signal shaping is
the scattering on certain Fourier-harmonics ǫ. It is therefore convenient ﬁrst
to highlight the relation between the scattered signal spectrum and spectral
characteristics of the medium.

By going to the spectral representations for u and ǫ in (1) we obtain
following expression for received signal spectrum, fully equaivalent to the
initial (1):

u(ω) =

I(ω, ν, k0, −→k )ǫ(ν, −→k )dνd−→k

d−→r

RsRi

ϕ(−→r , k0, −→k ) = −→k −→r + (k0 + ν/c)Rs + k0Ri

The integral in (4) is proportional to the amplitude of the signal scattered

on a separate spatial harmonic and contains a rapidly oscillating function.

The virtue of (3) is that one can interpret received signal without av-
eraging, when we have the model of ǫ(ν, −→k ), because usually we have only
spectral form. The drawbacks of such representation (neglecting rapidly os-
cillating function under integral (4)) are that it is selective Bragg scattering
character, which is well known for the small scatterers(4). That is why we will
transform this representation (3) to the form with this drawback removed.

According to [Newton,1969] [Tatarsky,1967], let us assume that the main
mechanism is the Bragg scattering and that the largest contribution to the
scattered signal is made by medium spatial harmonics, the wave number
of which has the order of twice the incident wave number and so will be
large. The distances range from which the signal arrives (determined by
the crossing of the beam factor g and the weighting function H),
is in
the antennas far-ﬁeld range and also will be large. Therefore,the phase in
(5), the product of the wave number by the distance, is a large parame-
ter kr >> (D/λ0)2 >> 1 wich makes it possible to evaluate this integral
by the stationary-phase method(SPM) [Fedoryuk,1987], whose applicability
conditions will be discussed below.

The expression under the integral sign in (4) has a stationary point −→r0 (−→k )
which makes the main contribution to the integral. Its location is deﬁned by
the equation

−→k (−→r0 ) =

((k0 + ν/c)

Rs(−→r0 )

(6)

which is a modiﬁed Wolf-Bragg condition for the scattering from nonsta-

tionary spatial arrays.

As a ﬁrst approximation, the integral in (4) is therefore equal to the

contribution from the stationary point:

(8)
where ξ = ν/(ck0) is usually small because of the narrow-bandedness of

the received signal.

The quantity V has the meaning of a ’cophasal’ region spatial volume that
makes the main contribution to the amplitude of scattering on the spatial
harmonic in (4). Thus the main contribution to the integral in (4) comes
from ’cophasal’ regions of spatial harmonic arrays having a nearly ellipsoidal
shape. The direction toward these regions is determined by a modiﬁed Wolf-
Bragg condition (6), and their volume is deﬁned by (8). It is evident that
the linear dimension of the ’cophasal’ region has the Fresnel radius order
RF = (λr)1/2.

The scattered signal is the superposition of contributions from separate
spatial harmonics. Therefore, by substituting (7) into (3), we obtain the
radar equation relating the received signal spectrum to the medium irregu-
larity spectrum:

If, instead of the coordinate system tied to wave vectors −→k , we use a sys-
tem of spatial coordinates −→r0 , this would amount to calculating the transition
Jacobian which turns out to be

exp(iϕ(−→r0 , k0, −→k ))d−→k dν

The two expressions for the received signal, (9) and (11), are diﬀerent
representations for the scattered signal written in terms of integrals over
space and over the wave vectors space, and they relate the received signal
spectrum to spectral characteristics of irregularities.

In radar equations obtained (9),(11) unlike the initial equations (1),(3)
the Bragg character of scattering is emphasized (6), that is why they looks
more useful for analysis than initial ones (1),(3).

3.2 The validity range of the expressions obtained.

The validity range of the resulting expressions for the scattered signal (9),(11)
is determined by the region where we can use the ﬁrst approximation of
initial integral by expanding it in asymptotic seria by the SPM technique
and not taking into account next members of seria. In accordance with SPM
theory one can take into account next members, but equations obtained is
too diﬃcult. That is why we use pretty simple criterium [Fedoryuk,1987] for
estimation of ﬁrst order equations validity. According to it, next members
of seria can be neglected, if the next condition is satisﬁed:

scattered from exact spatial harmonic of ǫ.

Let us consider the limitations in the case of sounding with the inﬁnite
signal when H(ω
ν, −→r ) do not depend on −→r . We will consider the cartesian
coordinates system linked with eﬀective scattering volume, two basis orthes
of which lies on the plane determined by the vectors Rs(−→r0 ), Ri(−→r0 ), one orth
is parallel to the the direction transmitter-receiver. In this coordinate system

The ﬁrst condition is coincident with validity limitations of initial equa-
tions (1),(3) - the scattering volume must be in the far-ﬁeld range of receved
and transmitted antennas, and that is why the ﬁrst condition do not make any
additional limitations in comparison with the initial ones (1),(3). The second
condition requires to exclude from analysis both forward scattering (the con-
dition is not sutisﬁed for forward scattering when r
0) and backscattering
D the condition a2/λ >> r is not
case (for monostatic experiment when a
sutisﬁed and eﬀective scattering volume (8) degenerates into inﬁnity and the
formulas needs appropriative modiﬁcation [Berngardt and Potekhin, 2000]).
Usualy in the bistatic case those conditions are sutisﬁed.

For the length of the sounding signal and the receiving window which
determine the form of the kernel H(ω, −→r ), the requirement (12) implies that
the signal and the receiving window change little within distances of the
Fresnel radius order:

dH(ω, −→r )/d−→r

H(ω, −→r )ω/c << H(ω, −→r )/(λr)1/2

≈

8

This corresponds to using narrow-band signals and windows:

(∆Ωo + ∆Ωa)/c << 1/(λr)1/2

(14)

Thus the conditions (13),(14) determines the validity range of equations

obtained (9),(11).

3.3 Selective properties of the radar equations obtained.

Let us consider in greater detail the properties of the resulting radar equa-
tions (9),(11). The expressions obtained above establish a linear relation
between the scattered signal spectrum and the spatial spectrum of dielectric
density ﬂuctuations. They clearly show selective properties of the scattering
determining the region of Fourier-harmonics which make the main contribu-
tion to the scattering.

The expression (7) is useful for determining the signal scattered on some
spatial harmonic. In real situations, however, the medium involves diﬀerent
harmonics. Furthermore, as has been shown above, for each spatial harmonic
the greatest contribution to the scattering will be made by the region of ef-
fective scattering (RES) whose location is determined by the Wolf-Bragg
condition (6). Also, the contribution to the scattering from those spatial
harmonics whose RES lies outside the region of beam crossing, is small. If
the beams are considered to be cones (with the angles ∆Θi and ∆Θs for the
transmitter and the receiver, respectively), then it is possible to obtain an
upper estimate (assuming that the sounding signal and the receiving win-
dow are long enough) of the selectivity using wave vectors from geometrical
considerations.

The spread of wave vectors involved in the scattering along directions in

the plane passing through the receiver and the transmitter is

∆ϕ = ∆Θi + ∆Θs

The spread of wave vectors in absolute value is determined by the expres-

sion:

∆k = kmid(∆Θi + ∆Θs),

where kmid = 2k0 cos(β0/2) is the wave vector corresponding to the scat-
tering from the the weight volume center. The wave vectors spread along

(15)

(16)

9

directions in the plane normal to the receiver-transmitter axis is estimated
by the formulae

∆ψ = min(

∆Θi,

∆Θs)

Ri
H

Rs
H

(17)

where H is the height at which the scattering volume is located above

the ground.

The wave vectors that make the main contribution to the scattering lie
within a region near the middle wave vector −−→kmid, corresponding to the Bragg
scattering from the center of the volume covered by the beam (6).

A selectivity of the scattering process for the scattering by a small scat-
terer was shown in [Newton,1969]; in a statistical setting of the problem,
it was estimated in [Tatarsky,1967],[Ishimaru,1981], but in a linear setting
of the scattering by an arbitrary extended scatterer this scattering process
selectivity has not yet been established to date. Thus the resulting radar
equations (9),(11) make it possible to establish selective properties of the
scattering, and to determine the region of wave vectors involved in the scat-
tering, both in direction and in absolute value. They can be used in the
analysis of scattered signals, rather than their statistical characteristics only.

4 The statistical radar equations.

In this section, the radar equation is obtained for arbitrary spatial correlation
radii of irregularities, and limitations on its applicability and its limiting cases
are considered.

Using the starting equation (1), let us develop the expression for the
scattered signal mean statistical spectral power (up to constant factors and
with the transition to a spectral representation from diﬀerence arguments):

relation function of dielectric permitivity ﬂuctuations. Its arguments are the
mean statistical distance −→r , the correlation radius −→ρ , and the correlation
time τ [Rytov et al., 1978].
It is apparent that the integrals appearing in
(18),(19) are analogous to the integral in (4) considered above and contain a
rapidly oscillating function under the integral. We now apply the procedure
described in the preceding section to the expressions (18),(19). It is seen that
the integral in over −→R (19) can be evaluated by a three-dimensional SPM, as
done in the preceding section. The integral over −→r can be evaluated using
this method on the assumption that the dielectric permitivity ﬂuctuations
spectral density Φ(ν, −→r , −→k ) (the spatio-temporal spectrum of their correla-
tion function) changes slowly with −→r . Criteria for weak variability will be
presented below. Thus, by integrating (18),(19) over −→R and −→r , respectively,
by the stationary-phase method, we get:

The radar equation obtained here relates the spectral power of the scat-

the space of wave vectors. In a manner like obtaining (11) from (9), one can
obtain the radar equation relating these two functions in terms of an inte-
gral over space, for which purpose it suﬃces merely to take into account the
transition Jacobian from the coordinate system −→k to the coordinate system

Here −→k (−→r0 ) is determined by the modiﬁed Wolf-Bragg condition (23).
The validity range of the resulting expressions (25),(26) is constrained, in
addition to the limitations pointed out in the preceding section, by media,
for which the ﬂuctuations spectral density changes little with a change of the
direction in the parameter −→r by the angle (λ/r)1/2. This implies that mean
statistical properties of the medium change little in −→r within distances of
the Fresnel radius order.

Selective properties of the scattering are also pronounced in the resulting
radar equation. The beam factor g(−→r ) determines selection both from wave
vectors which make the main contribution to the scattering, and from spatial
regions, with the wave vector and the spatial location of the diagnosed region

12

being related by the condition (23). This corresponds to the local fulﬁllment
of the Wolf-Bragg conditions at each point of the diagnosed medium. The
eﬀective weight volume W (ω, S, k) that is determined solely by the sounding
signal and receiving window forms, determines also the selective properties
of the scattering for wave numbers, distances, and frequencies.
Its width
in the spatial variable S determines the region of transmitter-irregularity-
receiver optical paths for irregularities contributing to the scattering, while
the width in the wave variable extends further the region of ﬂuctuations
spectral density wave numbers participating in the scattering. The width
of the wave numbers region in absolute values and distances was considered
earlier, having the order of (15)-(17), and their values are concentrated near
the wave vector corresponding to the fulﬁllment of the Wolf-Bragg condition
for the center of the diagnosed volume. In the frequency variable, the eﬀective
volume is convoluted with the spectral density. For that reason, the scattered
signal spectrum is mostly broader than the frequency spectrum of the spectral
density of ﬂuctuations, and this broadening is determined by the properties
of the eﬀective weight volume.

4.1 Limiting cases of the radar equations obtained.

Let us illustrate the implications of the resulting radar equation for two lim-
iting cases of scattering media. In the case of a time-independent isotropic
medium with a small spatial correlation radius, the irregularities spatial spec-
trum is suﬃciently broad in all directions −→k , is uniform in −→r , and has the
form of a δ-function in frequency ν. For such a model of the medium, an
integration can be performed in (26) over these parameters to give a stan-
dard radar equation for the power of the scattered signal for small spatial
correlation radii [Tatarsky,1967],[Ishimaru,1981]:

It is evident that the spectral power of the scattered signal at each fre-

and by dimensions the Fresnel radius (the size of the ’cophasal’ region

from its own point of space and with the amplitude determined by the other
terms involved in (25). Thus, by virtue of the radar equation proporties,
the spectrum of the received signal will diﬀer from the spectral density fre-
quency spectrum, and will be determined solely by the beam. This distortion
of the received signal spectrum when compared with the medium frequency
spectrum in the case of the scattering from a separate harmonic array is
not described by a standard radar equation [Tatarsky,1967],[Ishimaru,1981],
and one have to consider consequent models for exact experiment condi-
tions for explanation of the phenomena observed experimentaly (for exam-
ple, for radioacoustic sounding this leads to the signiﬃcant diﬀerence be-
tween expected doppler shift and observed frequency shift of received signal
[Kon and Tatarski,1980]).

5 Conclusion

In this paper we have outlined the method for obtaining the relation between
scattered signal and spectral characteristics of the medium, which implies
essentially the transition to a consideration of the scattering on medium
spatial harmonics and to the the stationary-phase method implementation
for calculating the contributions from separate harmonics.

By using the proposed method we have obtained two equivalent radar
equations relating the Fourier-spectrum of the scattered signal to the spa-
tial Fourier-spectrum of dielectric permitivity ﬂuctuations (9),(11) for the

14

case where the receiver and the transmitter are not in the far-ﬁeld range of
the scattering volume. These equations show explicitly the selective char-
acter of the scattering process: the main contribution to the scattering is
made by spatial harmonics of the medium, for which conditions similar to
the Wolf-Bragg conditions are satisﬁed (6). The validity range of the expres-
sion obtained in this study is virtually coincident with that of the starting
expression in a spatio-temporal representation (1) provided that suﬃciently
narrow-band sounding signals are used (14) and the cases of exactly backward
(considered in [Berngardt and Potekhin, 2000]) and exactly forward sound-
ings are excluded (13). Thus the resulting expressions (9),(11) are an ana-
logue for (1) in a spectral region in most bistatic experiments on remote
probing of media. The radar equation obtained in this study is a generaliza-
tion of formulas for small scatterers [Newton,1969] to scatteres of an arbitrary
size. In problems of media diagnostics, equations (9),(11) can be used to an-
alyze scattering signals as such, rather than their statistical characteristics
alone.

The proposed method has been used to obtain two equivalent, statisti-
cal radar equations for arbitrary radii of spatial correlation (25),(26) which
hold true for media whose mean statistical parameters change little within
distances of the Fresnel radius order. This limitation usually true for mea-
surements of real media, because mean statistical parameters of the medium
(scattering section, drift velocity, etc.) usually vary smoothly throughout the
diagnosed volume.

It has been shown that these radar equations (25),(26) can be useful for
obtaining both a standard radar equation for small spatial correlation radii of
irregularities (27) and radar equations for other models of scattering media.
The statistical radar equations obtained (25),(26) one should use instead
of standart in the cases where spatial correlation radii are compared to or
greater than Fresnel radius in some direction. The situations can arise, for
example, in case of scattering from ionospheric irregularities elongated with
Earths magnetic ﬁeld and in case of scattering from anisotropic air turbu-
lence and do arise in case of atmosphere radioacoustic sounding. The non-
statistical radar equations obtained (9),(11) may be useful for analysis of
scattered signal without averaging.

NORTH ATLANTIC HURRICANE CHANGES

Abstract. Bayesian statistical models were developed for the
number of tropical cyclones and the rate at which these cyclones
became hurricanes in the North Atlantic. We ﬁnd that, controlling
for the cold tongue index and the North Atlantic oscillation index,
there is high probability that the number of cyclones has increased
in the past thirty years; but the rate at which these storms become
hurricanes appears to be constant. We also investigate storm inten-
sity by measuring the distribution of individual storm lifetime in
days, storm track length, and Emanuel’s power dissiptation index.
We ﬁnd little evidence that the distribution of individual storm
intensity is changing through time. Any increase in cumulative
yearly storm intensity and potential destructiveness, therefore, is
due to the increasing number of storms and not due to any increase
in the intensity of individual storms.

1. Introduction

It is important to be able to statistically characterize the distribu-
tion of the number of hurricanes in the North Atlantic, especially if this
number is increasing or the intensity of hurricanes is changing. Sev-
eral studies have examined this. The most important recent paper is
Emanuel (2005), in which he argued that hurricanes in the North At-
lantic have become more destructive over the past 30 years. To measure
potential “destructiveness”, he developed a measure called the power
dissipiation index, which is a function of the cubed wind speed of a
storm over its lifetime (see Sec. 2 for a precise deﬁnition).
In his
original paper, this index was not just a measure of a single storm’s
intensity, but a cumulative index over all the storms during the year.
Peilke (2005) and Landsea (2005) criticized the data analysis method
used to demonstrate that the index was increasing; by pointing out that
the smoothing method used on the raw time series data was slightly
ﬂawed, that errors in the observations should lead to a less certain
statement about increases, and that the wind speed adjustments used
by Emanuel were too aggressive.

Our observation is that the lumping together of all the storms within
a year has lead to a diﬀerent interpretation of what exactly is increas-
ing: storm number or (a function of) windspeed. Other explanations of
Emanuel’s ﬁndings may be that the number of cyclones has remained
(distributionally) constant, but that average storm intensity has in-
creased. Or it may also be that the number of cyclones has increased
but that the intensity on individual storms has remained constant,
or even decreased. Other combinations are, of course, possible: both

storm frequency and individual storm intensity might have increased.
We examine these scenarios below.

A ﬁrst step in such an analysis was taken by Elsner and Bossak
(2001), who examined the climatology and seasonal modeling of hur-
ricane rates using a series of Bayesian hierarchical models. Using this
modern approach allows us to easily make probability statements about
important parameters of storm correlates and to specify the uncertainty
of future predictions. Elsner and Jagger (2004) continued the Bayesian
modelling line by controlling, in their models, for the inﬂuence of the
cold tounge index and the North Atlantic oscillation index. They found
that both of these indices were well correlated with the mean hurricane
number. We also use these indicies in our models below. Elsner et al.
(2001) investigate the relationship between ENSO and hurricane num-
bers. Hoyos et al. (2006) examine these and other factors that may
contribute to increases in the mean frequency of hurricanes.

Elsner et al. (2004) and Jewson and Penzer (2006) examine whether
there were shifts, or change points, in the statistical distribution of hur-
ricane numbers. Both groups of authors did ﬁnd likely changes, namely
around 1900, the mid 1940s, mid 1960s, and the mid 1990s. These shifts
may have been due to actual changes in physical mechanisms (such as
large-scale shifts in the atmospheric or oceanic circulations) or they
may be due to changes in measurements, though all authors agree that
the changes are probably a combination of both. We take this topic up
below, but we do not seek to answer why these changes take place, or
even if they are certain. It is clear enough, however, that the data has
changed in character through time. Thus, we build our models using
diﬀerent ranges of data in an attempt to incorporate this uncertainty.
Our approach is diﬀerent from previous analyses in two ways: (1)
we hierarchically model the number of tropical storms and then the
chance that hurricanes arise from them, as opposed to directly model-
ing the number of hurricanes (or hurricane land falls); and (2) in line
with Webster et al. (2005) we characterize the distribution of storm
intensity within a given year and ask whether this distribution changes
through time. We investigate storm intensity by measuring storm life-
time in days, storm track length, and Emanuel’s power dissiptation
index applied to invididual storms.

We use the hurricane reanalysis database (HURDAT) Jarvinen at
al. (2002) and, e.g. Landsea et al. (2004). This database contains six-
hourly maximum sustained 1-minute winds at 10 m, central pressures,
and position to the nearest 0.1◦ latitude and longitude from all known
tropical storms from 1851-2006. A cyclone was classiﬁed as a “hurri-
cane” if, at any time during its lifetime, the maximum windspeed ever

4

NORTH ATLANTIC HURRICANE CHANGES

met or exceeded 65 knots. Obviously, this cutoﬀ, though historical, is
somewhat aribitrary and other numbers can be used: we discuss this in
greater detail below. To investigate the realtionship of North Atlantic
tropical storms with ENSO, we also use the cold tongue index (CTI)
Deser and Wallace (1990) and e.g. Cai (2003). And we use the North
Atlantic oscillation index (NAOI) from Jones et al. (1997).

Section 2 lays out the statistical models and methods that we use,
Section 3 contains the main results, and Section 4 presents some ideas
for future research.

2. Methods

We adopt, as have many before, Bayesian statistical models. An
important advantage to these models is that we can make direct prob-
ability statetments about the results. We are also able to create more
complicated and realistic models and solve them using the same numer-
ical strategy; namely, Gibbs sampling. We do not go into depth about
the particular methods involved in forming or solving these models, as
readers are likely familiar with these methods nowadays. There are
also many excellent references available, e.g. Gelman et al. (2003).

It is important to control for factors that are known to be related,
or could cause changes in, the frequency of tropical cyclones and storm
intensity. There are many such possible variables, but we choose, for
ease of comparison, the same indicies as cited in the paper by Elsner
and Jagger (2004). These factors are the cold tongue index and the
North Atlantic oscillation index. Readers are encouraged to refer to the
original sources and references therein to learn about these indicies.

2.1. Number of storms. Most statistical analysis focuses on the num-
ber of hurricanes or the subset of landfalling hurricanes, e.g. Elsner and Jagger
(2004); Elsner and Bossak (2001). The approach here is diﬀerent. We
ﬁrst model the number of tropical cyclones and then model whether or
not, for any given tropical cyclone, a hurricane evolves from it. Speciﬁ-
cally, we do not separately model the frequency of both hurricanes and
cyclones, as doing this ignores the relationship of how cyclones develop
into hurricanes.

We suppose, in year i of n years, that the number of storms is well

approximated by a Poisson distribution as in

(1)

si ∼ Poisson(λi)

where λi describes the mean (and variance) of the number of storms.
It is of primary interest to discover whether this parameter is changing
(possibly increasing) through time, controlling for known important

NORTH ATLANTIC HURRICANE CHANGES

5

meterological and oceaniographic variables. Elsner and Jagger (2004)
developed this same model for the number of hurricanes (and not cy-
clones per se). Here we adapt it to the number of cyclones, and add in
the possibility that the parameter λ changes in a linear fashion in time
(we also, for ease of reference, adopt Elsner and Jagger’s notation).
Thus, we further model λi as a function of the CTI and the NAOI, and
allow the possibility that λi changes linearly through time. We use the
generalized linear model

(2)

log(λi) = β0 + β1t + β2CTIi + β3NAOIi + β4CTIi × NAOIi

The prior for β is

(3)

β ∼ MV N(a, b−1)

that is, β = (β0, β1, . . . , β4) is distributed as multivariate Normal, and
t = 1, . . . , n. We take noninformative values on the hyperparameter
a = (0, 0, . . . , 0). Two priors were tried for b−1 = 0, which is equivalent
to the standard improper ﬂat prior, and a general covariance matrix
where b was given values on the oﬀ diagonals to allow for correlations
between the betas; both priors gave nearly equivalent results both in
this model and those below. We report results on the standard prior
(technically, b−1 is the precision and b−1 = 0 is the default “ignorance”
prior in the software, which is described in Section 3). Thus, if the
posterior, for example, Pr(β1 > 0|data) is large then we would have
conﬁdence that the mean number of storms is increasing.

We will also be interested in two other posterior probability distribu-

∞
−∞ p(λi|β, data)p(β|data)dβ,
R

tions, useful for model checking: p(λi|data) =
which is the posterior of the mean number of storms in year i integrat-
ing over the uncertainty in (the multidimensional) βi, and p(gi|data) =
∞
0 p(gi|λi, data)p(λi|data)dλi, where the later represents the posterior
predictive density (a guess) of the number of storms gi in year i inte-
R
grating out the uncertainty in λi represented by p(λi|data): to be clear,
p(gi|data) is the distribution we would use if we wanted to make a fore-
cast for si given t, CT Ii, and NAOIi, integrating over the uncertainty
we have in β and λi. These two distributions are not analytic and in
practice we sample from them using Monte Carlo methods, which are
described below.

Once a tropical storm develops it, of course, has a chance to grow
into a hurricane. If there are s tropical cyclones in a year the number
of hurricanes is constrained to be between 0 and s. Thus, a reasonable
model for the number of hurricanes hi in year i given si is

(4)

hi|si ∼ Binomial(si, θi)

6

(5)

(6)

NORTH ATLANTIC HURRICANE CHANGES

Now, if we assume that the prior on θi is

θi ∼ Beta(a, b)

with a = b = 1 (which represents a ﬂat prior) then the posterior of θi
is

θi|hi, si, a, b ∼ Beta(hi − 1, si − hi − 1)

which makes calculations easy. This same model could of course be
adapted to deﬁne hurricanes as “major storms” using cutoﬀs greater
than 65 knots, say greater than 114 knots for category 4 storms. We
could then estimate how many tropical cyclones evolve to these more
destructive storms (we plan to address this more completely in future
work, though we make a few comments below).

It is possible, however, as with λi, that θi is dependent on CTI and
NAOI and that it changes through time. To investigate this, we adopt
the following logistic regression model

= β0 + β1t + β2CTIi + β3NAOIi + β4CTIi × NAOIi

(7) log

θi
1 − θi (cid:19)

(cid:18)

where we again let

(8)

β ∼ MV N(a, b)

where a, b are as before. And again, if, for example, Pr(β1 > 0|data)
is large then we would have conﬁdence that the number of storms
that turn into hurricanes is increasing. In practice, however, we ﬁrst
transform the posteriors by exponentiation, thus the posteriors have
the natural interpretation of odds ratios for the increase (or decrease)
in theta. So we would instead look at Pr(exp(β1) > 1|data), and if this
is large, we would have good evidence that the mean rate of cyclones
converting to hurricanes is increasing, i.e the odds of converting are
greater than 1.

2.2. Measures of intensity. It may be that the frequency of storms
and hurricanes remains unchanged through time, but that other char-
acteristics of these storms have changed. One important characteristic
is intensity. We deﬁne three measures of intensity, in line with those
deﬁned in Webster et al. (2005): (1) the length m, in days, that a storm
lives; (2) the length of the track (km) of the storm over its lifetime;
and (3) the power dissipation index as derived by Emmanuel, though
here we apply this to each cyclone individually.

m was directly available from the HURDAT reanalysis: we approx-
imate the number of days to the nearest six-hours. Track length was

NORTH ATLANTIC HURRICANE CHANGES

7

estimated by computing the great circle distance between succesive six-
hour observations of the cyclone, and summing these over the storm
lifetime. The power dissipation index (PDI) is deﬁned by

(9)

PDI =

V 3
maxdt

T

Z
0

where V 3
max is the maximum sustained wind speed at 10m, and T repre-
sents the total time that the storm lived. Practically, we approximate
the PDI—up to a constant—by summing the values (Vmax/100)3 at
each six-hour observation. The PDI is a crude measure of the strength
of the potential destructiveness of a tropical storm or hurricane, as
cited by Emanuel (2005). Other than this measure, we say nothing
directly about storm destructiveness (in terms of money etc.).

It was found that log transforms of these variables made them much
more managable in terms of statistical analysis. Transforming them led
to all giving reasonable approximations of normal distributions; thus,
standard methods are readily available.

For all three of these measures, we adopt a hierarchical modelling
approach because we are interested if the distribution within a year
of these measures changes through time. Let xi,j be any of the three
measures (m, track length, or PDI) for storm i in year j. Then we
suppose that

(10)

where

log xi,j ∼ N(γi,j, χ)

(11)

γi,j = β0 + β1t + β2CTIj + β3NAOIj + β4CTIj × NAOIj

and, as before, where

(12)

β ∼ MV N(µ, τ )

and µ = 0, and χ, τ , which are assumed independent of µ, have inverse
Gamma(0.005, 0.005) ﬂat priors. This model is, of course, similar to
those above, except that we seek to characterize the distribution of
intensity within each year and see how that distribution mean might
change in a (linear) way.

3. Results

All computations were carried out in the R statistical system R Development Core Team

(2005) using the MCMC package Martin and Quinn (2007) on a Fedora
Core 6 platform. Models were ﬁtted using Gibbs sampling. The ﬁrst
1000 simulations were considered “burn in” and were removed from the

8

NORTH ATLANTIC HURRICANE CHANGES

analysis: 10,000 additional samples were calculated after this and used
to approximate the posterior distirbutions.

Data for all the measures we use was available from 1851, but we
use only data from 1900 onwards. The data from before this date,
as is well known, is suspect enough to cast suspicion on any results
based on them.
It is also not clear that a strict linear model over
the entire period of 1900-2006 would best ﬁt these data as observation
and instrument changes through that time have changed Elsner et al.
(2004). So we adopt the practice of computing each model over three
diﬀerent time periods: once for the entire period 1900-2006; the second
for dates between 1950-2006; and the third between 1980-2006. These
choices are somewhat arbitrary, but in line with the change-point re-
sults of Elsner et al. (2004); Jewson and Penzer (2006). Other choices
are easily made, however, and we have found that our results are ro-
bust to changes in these exact start times. This approach also lets us
check whether a linear model for increase/decrease of the parameters
through time is reasonable. We do not investigate more complicated
models, such as linear change point regression models, here. Lastly,
we do not adjust the observed wind speed in any way Pielke (2005);
Landsea (2005); Emanuel (2005).

3.1. Number of storms. The top two panels of Fig. 1 shows the
time series plots of s and h. There does appear, to the eye, to be an
increase in s in the past two decades and perhaps a smaller increase in
h, in line with what others have found.

Figure 2 shows the posterior distributions from the model (2). Table
In each case, and in
1 gives the summary statistics for this model.
all future ﬁgures, the solid line represents the model using all data
from 1900-2006; the dashed line represents the model using data from
1950-2006; and the dotted line represents the model using data from
1980-2006. Regardless of the data used, there is good evidence that
Pr(β1 > 0|data) ≈ 1, which implies that the mean number of storms
has increased through time. However, using only the most recent (1980-
2006) data does not give a very certain estimate for β1, which can be
see by noting that the probability for β1 taking any particular value is
distributed over a large range of possible values.

The parameter β0 is the “intercept” in model (2), and is the estimate
of λi when the other parameters, time included, are set to 0. Thus its
particular value does not directly mean much. We can note that the
intercept for λi has shifted to higher values when considering the two
later data sets, though we can not rule out that there has actually been
change because the three distributions show great overlap.

There is also strong evidence, as Elsner and Jagger found, that the
CTI (β2) is important in estimating λi: greater CTIs lead to smaller
λs, and therefore to a smaller probability that the mean number of
storms will be high; or more plainly, greater CTI means fewer storms.
It appears that this realtionship has strengthened in later years (1980-
2006), as the distribution has shifted to smaller numbers.

10

NORTH ATLANTIC HURRICANE CHANGES

Results for the NAOI (β3) are more mixed. Data from 1900-2006
and 1950-2006 do not give high probability that NAOI is inﬂuential.
But when only the 1980-2006 data is used, the probability is high that
when NAOI is greater that λ will be smaller, and again, a smaller
probability that the number of storms will be high. The same goes for
the interaction between CTI and NAOI (β3), though even using the
1980-2006 data does not give conclusive results.

The Table presents the same data as the ﬁgures, but only for the
1980-2006, in tabular form, so that readers can read a best (assuming
absolute error loss) estimate of each β at the median (50%-tile). 95%
credible intervals can also be read from the table: the values from
the 2.5%- to the 97.5%-tiles. The last column gives the estimated
probability that P (β > 0|data). For β1, if this number is large, it
means we have great conﬁndence that increases are taking place. For
the other βs, if this number is near 0, it means that we are conﬁdent
that P (β < 0|data) (= 1 − P (β > 0|data)).

These, and the following results, are only as good as the model. To
check model quality, we present Figs. 3 and 4, plotted for the 1980-
2006 data. Fig. 3 is a plot of the two posterior distributions p(λi|data)
and p(gi|data). Overplotted on both of these distributions is the actual
value (in black dots) of si. Recall, that p(λi|data) is our best guess of
the mean number of storms, and not the number of storms themselves.
This is the right-hand side of the ﬁgure: p(gi|data). To calculate these,
we use the same MCMC results that came from the generation of the
posteriors of β, and plug these into (2) (along the with the appropriate
values of t, CT Ii, and NAOIi) and then solve for λi. We ﬁrst sort the
actual values of s and plot density estimates of the posteriors, adding
an arbitrary number to each so that they may all ﬁt on the same
plot. Fatter plots indicate more uncertainty as to the exact value of λi;
narrower plots indicate the opposite. Most of the dots are somewhat
near the peaks of these posteriors, but certainly not all.

The right-hand side shows the posterior of the best guess gi. These
posteriors are got from, at each of the 10,000 samples of each λi, simu-
lating 50 Poisson random variables with mean λi: then, the 50×10, 000
values are used in building density estimates of the posterior predicitve
gi. Notice that these plots are jagged, which is due to the discrete
nature of gi and si. Here, to give some relief to the ﬁgure we estimated
the density and took the cube root of each frequency value; which has
the eﬀect of exaggerating the high (mode) values so they are easier to
see. These posteriors are certainly more spread out, as expected. For
example, if g ∼ Poisson(12) then a 90% prediction interval is 8 to 17.

However, it is clearer from this picture that the model is not behaving
too badly.

More practically, a forecaster would pick a single number

gi as a
guess, plus a measure of uncertainty of this guess. Fig. 4 shows the
actual values si (slightly jittered to separate the points) by the median
of gi|data. A one-to-one line is also shown. Thick black lines are the
50% credible interval, and the dotted thin lines are the 90% credible
interval. All but 7 of the points are within the 50% prediction intervals,
and all but one (2005) are within the 90% prediction intervals. This

b

12

gives us conﬁdence that the model we have chosen is representative of
the real ocean-atmosphere; though it is, of course, not perfect.

The bottom panel of Fig. 1 shows the ratio hi/si which does not
give much indication of changing through time. Under this assumption,
and using the well-known properties of the posterior (5) for the data
1900-2006, we estimate that the mean fraction of converting storms is
θ = P hi−1
992 = 0.56, and standard deviation of 0.01 (calculation
not shown). That is, once a tropical cyclone forms, there is a 56%
b
chance that it will evolve into a hurricane. Results for 1950-2006 are
58%, and for 1980-2006 are 55% (with similar standard deviations).

P si−1 = 564

But applying model (6) gives Fig. 5; summarized also in Table 1.
The rate at which storms become hurricanes does not appear to change
through time, evidenced by the probability of β1 not near 1 is small:
recall that these results are in the form of odds ratios, except for β0,
which is in the form of odds. Actually, there is some evidence, using
the data from 1950-2006, that mean rate at which storms evolved was
actually less, though the eﬀect, if real, was quite small. The best
estimate, using 1980-2006, is that the odds of cyclone evolving into a
hurricane are 1 per year; which is, of course, no change at all. There is
weak evidence that CTI contributes negatively, in the sense that when
CTI increases, the odds of a cyclone becoming a hurricane decreases,
by the odds of about 0.7 times per CTI unit. NAOI does not appear
important (most of the probability mass is around the odds ratio of 1).
The interaction of CTI and NAOI does not appear important.

The conclusion is that there is good evidence that the number of
tropical cyclones has increased, but that the chance that these cyclones
become hurricanes has remained constant, even after controlling for
CTI and NAOI. This also means, of course, that it is likely that the
number of hurricanes has also increased.

We repeated this analysis (plots not shown, though results are in
the Table) for category 4 and above hurricanes using the 1980-2006
data (deﬁned as a cyclone which had winds meeting or exceeding 114
knots at any time during its lifetime), and ﬁnd that the odds that
the rate these storms evolve from tropical cyclones has increased by
the odds of only 1.004 times per year (95% credible interval 1.000 to
1.009). Much of this increase is due to 1999, when 42% of the cyclones
evolved into major storms, whereas the average rate over the remaining
years is about 10%. Now, it is well known that standard regression
models, such as this one, are quite sensitive to these sort of “outliers”,
so this result should be taken with a very large grain of salt. Too, the
eﬀect disappears when the data from 1950-2006 is used (95% credible

interval 0.998 to 1.002). There is good evidence that CTI contributes
negatively, in the sense that when CTI increases, the odds of a cyclone
becoming a major storm decreases, by the odds of about 0.3 times per
CTI unit. NAOI does not appear important (most of the probability
mass is around the odds ratio of 1). The interaction of CTI and NAOI
does appear important, though this is in large part driven by the CTI
values.

3.2. Measures of intensity. Figure 6 shows the time series boxplots,
for each year, of log(m), log(track length), and log(PDI). The boxplot
gives an indication of the distribution of each measure within each year.
There is no apparent trend in the sense that, say, the medians show no
systematic direction, and the other quantiles appear distributed around
a central point. If this graphical view holds under modeling, it means
that cyclone distribution of intensity has not changed through time.

We now apply model (11) to each of these measures. Figs. 7-9 and

Table 1 summarize the results.

For none of the measures, using any of the data time sets, does there
appear to be substantial evidence that the mean of the distribution of
these measures changed though time: the posteriors for β1 in each case
have most of their mass around 0. Except perhaps for (log) PDI using
the 1950-2006 data set. Here there is good evidence that mean (log)
PDI has decreased over this time period because most of the probability
mass is at values less than 0. (P (β < 0|data) = 0.998). Recall that
this is the distribution each individual storm’s PDI within a year, and
not a yearly (additive) summary.

For the (log) number of days or (log) track length, there is not much
evidence that CTI or NAOI are inﬂuential, evidenced by the high prob-
abilities of values around 0. This is not so for (log) PDI, where there
is some evidence that higher CTI and (and maybe higher NAOI) lead
to smaller mean (log) PDIs. The interaction between CTI and NAOI
does not appear important.

4. Conclusions

We ﬁnd that there is good evidence that the number of tropical
cyclones in the North Atlantic basin have increased in the past two-
and-a-half decades. This result stands even after controlling for CTI
and NAOI. These results are of course conditional on the model we
used being adequate or at least it being a reasonable approximation to
the data. Diagnostics plots (Figs. 3 and 4) indicate that the model

14

NORTH ATLANTIC HURRICANE CHANGES

performs well, though of course not perfectly, at predicting the histori-
cal data. We make no predictions about future increases as it would be
foolish to extrapolate the simple linear model we used into the future.
We also found that the rate at which tropical cyclones become hur-
ricanes does not appear to be changing through time, nor is it much
inﬂuenced by CTI or NAOI. There is weak evidence that the mean
rate at which major (category 4 or above) storms evolve has increased
through time, though the increase is very small, and it is just as likely
the model used to assess this rate is inadequate.

We ﬁnd almost no evidence that the distribution of individual storm
intensity, measured by storm days, track length, or individual storm
PDI, has changed (increased or decreased) through time. Any increase
in storm intensity at the conglomerate yearly level, as for example found
by Emanuel (2005), is likely due to the increased number of storms and
not by the increased intensity of individual storms. We also repeated
our analysis on the distribution of each storm’s (log) maximum wind
speed over its lifetime and came to the same conclusion as with the
other measures of intensity.

Much more exact work can be done. A model similar to that above
should certainly be used for storms across all ocean basins for which
data is available, as was recently done by Webster et al.
(2005).
Too, more sophisticated models could be used. For example, spa-
tial Bayesian models such as those developed by Wikle and Ander-
son (2003) for estimating tornado frequency change could be used for
tropical cyclones. This is not an easy task because tornadoes, in that
model, were treated as point objects, and, of course, hurricanes vary
in intensity over vast spatial lengths. The statistical characteristics of
individual tropical cyclones could be better addressed, by asking how
the change in intensity (by the three measures given above, and by
others such as pressure), changes through storm lifetime. And a more
complete model state-space like model for the multivariate measure of
intensity (days, track length, PDI) that takes into account the correla-
tion between these dimensions could certainly cast more light on how
individual storm intensity may or may not have changed through time.

Figure 2. The posterior distributions for the parame-
ters in model (2). In each case, and in all future ﬁgures,
the solid line represents the model using all data from
1900-2006; the dashed line represents the model using
data from 1950-2006; and the dotted line represents the
model using data from 1980-2006. Regardless of the data
used, there is good evidence that Pr(β1 > 0|data) ≈ 1,
which implies that the (rate of the) number of storms is
increasing through time. The other parameters are dis-
cussed in the main text. Posteriors with most of their
mass around 0 have little to no eﬀect on the outcome.

results here diﬀer in that the posteriors are in terms of

Thus, posteriors with most of their mass around 1 have

Statistical modelling of tropical cyclone tracks: a comparison of
models for the variance of trajectories

Abstract

We describe results from the second stage of a project to build a statistical model for hurricane
tracks. In the ﬁrst stage we modelled the unconditional mean track. We now attempt to model the
unconditional variance of ﬂuctuations around the mean. The variance models we describe use a semi-
parametric nearest neighbours approach in which the optimal averaging length-scale is estimated
using a jack-knife out-of-sample ﬁtting procedure. We test three diﬀerent models. These models
consider the variance structure of the deviations from the unconditional mean track to be isotropic,
anisotropic but uncorrelated, and anisotropic and correlated, respectively. The results show that, of
these models, the anisotropic correlated model gives the best predictions of the distribution of future
positions of hurricanes.

1 Introduction

We are interested in developing accurate methods to estimate the probability of extreme hurricanes mak-
ing landfall at diﬀerent locations. Estimating the probability of extreme events is diﬃcult because, by
the deﬁnition of what makes an extreme, the data is sparse. If we try and estimate hurricane landfall
probabilities using local data then this problem is acute: severe hurricanes only strike individual geo-
graphical locations very rarely. For some locations there are no strikes at all in the historical record, even
though such strikes may be possible. However, the problem of lack of data can be reduced, and the risk
estimated more accurately, by appropriate use of data from surrounding regions. Various methods have
been described that use this principle to estimate hurricane risks, such as those of Clark (1986), Darling
(1991) and Chu and Wang (1998). One of the most interesting approaches is to build a statistical model
for hurricane tracks and intensities across the whole of the Atlantic basin. This is the approach taken
in Drayton (2000), Vickery et al. (2000) and Emanuel et al. (2005), and is the approach we are taking
ourselves.
In general, when using surrounding data to estimate local parameters, one must decide on the size and
shape of the region from which data is to be taken and how the data within that region is to be weighted.
There is a balance between two eﬀects: using more data gives more precise estimates, but using less
relevant data can introduce biases. Finding where the optimal balance lies is crucial to any attempt to
build an accurate model.
In Hall and Jewson (2005) we have started building a new model for hurricane tracks in the Atlantic
basin, and we address the question of how best to use surrounding data by calculating the optimum size
of the data region using cross-validation. The track model that we describe is based on a two dimensional
linear stochastic process, with the two dimensions representing the longitude and latitude of the location
of a hurricane.
In Hall and Jewson (2005), and also in this article, we assume that the innovations
driving this stochastic process are Gaussian. Because of this simplifying assumption the model can be
completely speciﬁed by the appropriate means, variances and covariances. As a start, in Hall and Jewson
(2005) we describe a model for the unconditional mean. That is, a model for the expected motion of a
hurricane, given no information at all except the current location of the hurricane. The model uses a
nearest neighbours approach with an isotropic Gaussian weighting function incorporating a free parameter
length-scale. The cross-validation ﬁtting procedure gives an optimal length-scale of 300km.

In this article we describe what we consider to be the most appropriate next stage in building our track
model, which is the modelling of the unconditional variance of ﬂuctuations around the unconditional
mean tracks. What this adds to the model for the unconditional mean tracks can be described as follows.
The model for the unconditional mean can be used to make one step (6 hour) predictions for the future
location of a hurricane. A model for the unconditional mean and variance goes a step further and gives
one step predictions for the whole distribution of future locations of the hurricane. Again, the meaning
of ‘unconditional’ is that this prediction assumes no information at all except for the current location.
We are ignoring autocorrelations in time as well as other inﬂuences on the track such as the eﬀects of
intensity, time of year and ENSO state. All of these will be included in the model in due course.
We estimate the unconditional variance using a nearest neighbours approach, very similar to the method
used to estimate the unconditional mean. Broadly speaking, this approach works as follows. Using the
model for the unconditional mean we separate the observed hurricane tracks into an unconditional mean
component and a deviation from the unconditional mean. We then model the variance of these deviations
at each point in the basin as being equal to an empirical variance estimated from the observed deviations
near to that point. As before, a length-scale deﬁnes what we mean by ‘near’. We calculate a new length-
scale speciﬁcally for the variance to allow for the possibility that the length-scale could be diﬀerent from
that derived for the mean.
Within this overall framework we will compare three diﬀerent models for the variance, ranging from
simple to complex. We take this systematic simple-to-complex approach to try to ensure that we avoid
over-ﬁtting (i.e. we want to avoid using a complex model which performs less well than a simpler model
could). The models we are test are (a) one in which the variance structure of the deviations from the
mean is isotropic, (b) one in which the variance structure of the deviations is anisotropic but uncorrelated
relative to orthogonal axes deﬁned along and across the local unconditional mean trajectory, and (c) one
in which the variance structure of the deviations is anisotropic and correlated relative to these axes.
We now describe the data we will use for this study (section 2), the three models (section 3), and the
results from a comparison between the results of the three models (section 4). We then summarise the
results and describe our future plans (section 5). Finally we include two appendices which contain some
additional information and discussion.

2 The data

The basic data set for this study is a subset of the Hurdat data, as described in Hall and Jewson (2005).
In that study we used a nearest neighbours method to predict the unconditional mean of our stochastic
process. We use that model to make one-step (6 hour) predictions of the observed hurricane tracks. By
comparing these predictions with the actual tracks we can generate forecast errors. We take these forecast
errors as the starting point for the current study. We will refer to these forecast errors as the deviations
from the unconditional mean track.

3 The models

3.1 The isotropic model

Our initial model for the deviations from the unconditional mean track is isotropic in that we assume
that the variance of the deviations is the same in all directions. In other words, the contours of constant
probability density in the predicted distribution of the deviations are circular. In the continuous time
limit we can write this model as:

dX = µx(θ, φ)dt + σ(θ, φ)dWx
dY = µy(θ, φ)dt + σ(θ, φ)dWy

where X and Y are the longitude and latitude of the hurricane, θ and φ are longitude and latitude, µx
and µy are the unconditional mean velocities (determined by the model for the unconditional mean), σ
is the standard deviation of the deviations from the unconditional mean track and dWx and dWy are
independent Brownian motions. The standard deviation σ(θ, φ) is determined by the lengthscale λ and
the historical data, so we could write:

In order to ﬁt σ at the point (θ, φ) we calculate the weighted variance of the observed deviations from the
unconditional mean track model, where the deviations are weighted using a Gaussian weighting function

σ(θ, φ) = σ(historical data, λ)

(1)

(2)

so that nearest errors are much more important than distant errors. We vary the lengthscale in the
weighting function to ﬁnd which length-scale gives the optimal results.
How should we deﬁne ‘optimal’ for a probabilistic prediction model of this type? When ﬁtting the model
for the unconditional mean track, we used RMSE as the cost function. However, RMSE cannot be used to
ﬁt the variance, since changing the predicted variance doesn’t aﬀect it. The most obvious generalisation
of RMSE seems to be (minus one times) the log-likelihood of classical statistics, and this is what we use
as our cost function. We calculate the log-likelihood out of sample: an in-sample maximisation of the
log-likelihood would lead to an optimal lengthscale of zero. It would also not take into account parameter
uncertainty when comparing the results from diﬀerent models, and would thus not penalise over-ﬁtted
models.
We now derive an expression for the log-likelihood for the isotropic model.

3.1.1 Likelihood for the isotropic model

The multivariate normal distribution with dimension p has the density:

f =

2 D

(z − µ)

(cid:19)

where Σ is the covariance matrix (size p by p), D is the determinant of the covariance matrix (a single
number), z is a vector length p and µ is a vector length p.
In our two dimensional (p = 2) isotropic case we let z = (x, y) be the deviations from the unconditional
mean track, we deﬁne σ2 to be the variance of both x and y, and we set µ = 0 because we are looking
at deviations. The assumption of isotropy means that x and y are independent, and so the covariance
matrix Σ is just σ2 times the unit matrix:

Σ =

3.2 The anisotropic uncorrelated model

Our second model for the deviations from the mean track is anisotropic in that we allow for the deviations
to have diﬀerent variances in the diﬀerent directions deﬁned by the coordinate system. Rather than use
the (θ, φ) coordinate system of lines of longitude and latitude, it seems to make sense to use a coordinate
system deﬁned to suit the problem. The obvious choice is to use an orthogonal curvilinear coordinate
system based on the local unconditional mean tracks, as deﬁned in Hall and Jewson (2005) (see ﬁgure 3
in that paper). We write the deviations from the unconditional mean track within this coordinate system
as (u, v). u represents displacements along the mean track while v represents displacements across the
mean track. Within this coordinate system we assume that the forecast errors are independent. The
contours of constant probability density in this model are thus ellipses with their principal axes lying

along and across the directions given by the unconditional mean tracks. By comparing the ﬁtted values
of the variance in the u and v directions we will be able to see which of the principle axes is the longer
of the two.
We can write this model as:

dU = µu(θ, φ)dt + σu(θ, φ)dWu
dV = µv(θ, φ)dt + σv(θ, φ)dWv

where U and V are the projections of the hurricane motion in the directions parallel and perpendicular,
respectively, to the local mean track, and dWu and dWv are uncorrelated.

3.2.1 Likelihood for the anisotropic uncorrelated model

We deﬁne z = (u, v) (deviations from the mean track in the along-mean-track and across-mean-track
directions), and the variances of u and v to be σ2
v. µ = 0 because we are looking at deviations
from the mean tracks, and because we assume that u and v are independent the covariance matrix Σ is
diagonal and given by:

u and σ2

The inverse of the covariance matrix is:

where we have suppressed the i subscripts on σu and σv for clarity.

3.3 The anisotropic correlated model

Our third model for the deviations from the unconditional mean tracks is isotropic but correlated. As
with the previous model we use the (u, v) coordinate system based on the local unconditional mean tracks,
but now we also calculate the correlation between along-track and across-track errors in this coordinate
system. The contours of constant probability in this model are now ellipses but with arbitrary alignment
relative to the mean tracks. This alignment is determined by the correlation between the deviations in
the u and v directions.
We can write this model as:

dU = µu(θ, φ)dt + σu(θ, φ)dWu
dV = µv(θ, φ)dt + σv(θ, φ)dWv

where dWu and dWv are correlated with linear correlation coeﬃcient r.

4 Results

4.1 Log-likelihood scoring results

Figure 1 shows the log-likelihood score versus averaging length-scale for the three models. For the isotropic
model the optimal averaging length-scale is 380km (panel A). For the anisotropic uncorrelated model the
optimal averaging length-scale is 300km (panel B), and for the anisotropic correlated model the optimal
averaging length-scale is also 300km (panel C). These optimal length-scales were calculated to within
20km.
In ﬁgure 1, panel D, we compare the log-likelihood scores for the three models. We see that the isotropic
model gives the worst results, the anisotropic uncorrelated model gives somewhat better results and the
anisotropic correlated model gives the best of the three. One could, on the basis of this comparison,
conclude that the anisotropic correlated model is the best model to use. However, it is possible that these
diﬀerences are not really signiﬁcant i.e. that in fact the diﬀerences arise just because of the particular
sample of data we are working with, and that other samples would give a diﬀerent ordering for the
If this were the case then it might be better to use the isotropic model on the basis that
models.
it is simpler to understand and implement.
It is therefore important to assess the signiﬁcance of the
diﬀerences in log-likelihood scores. One way to assess whether the diﬀerences are signiﬁcant is to look at
them for each individual year, and this is shown in ﬁgure 2. The black curve shows the diﬀerences in the
log-likelihood scores between the isotropic and anisotropic uncorrelated models, and the dashed curve
shows the diﬀerences between the anisotropic uncorrelated model and the anisotropic correlated model.
Comparing the isotropic and anisotropic uncorrelated models we see that the anisotropic uncorrelated
model wins in 50 out of the 54 years of data on which we have tested. Comparing the anisotropic
uncorrelated model and the anisotropic correlated model we see that the anisotropic correlated model
wins in 42 of the 54 years we have tested.
How might we actually quantify the signiﬁcance of these diﬀerences? It would be wrong to test the
diﬀerences in the means between these models using a t-test or bootstrap, since the diﬀerent years are
sampled from diﬀerent distributions. This is because the likelihood values in each year depend on the
number of hurricanes in that year, as well as the length of each track. The likelihood score for a poor
model in a year with many long hurricane tracks could easily be greater than that for a good model in a
year in which there are only a few short hurricane tracks.
One way to avoid this diﬃculty might be to normalise the likelihood scores in each year using the number
of tracks and the number of points on the tracks, but that is hard to do in a fair way because of correlations
between errors along the tracks. As an alternative, we simply test whether 50 wins in 54 contests (and

42 wins in 54 contests) is signiﬁcant, against the null hypothesis that winning is equally likely for either
model. This is then equivalent to testing whether 50 or more heads in 54 coin tosses would be signiﬁcant
(and hence evidence for a biased coin). Using the CDF of the binomial distribution for 54 contests this
gives probabilities of over 0.99999999999 and over 0.99999 for our two tests. We see that the diﬀerences
between the three models are indeed highly signiﬁcant.
Since our log-likelihood scores are all calculated out-of-sample we can conclude that the anisotropic
correlated model is the best of the three models at predicting the distribution of the future positions of
the hurricane track. Thus, the contours of constant probability in the distribution of future positions
of a hurricane are signiﬁcantly elliptical, and the principal axes of these ellipses are signiﬁcantly rotated
relative to the mean track.

4.2 Variance and correlation maps

Having determined the optimum averaging length-scale within each model we can then calculate the
implied variance ﬁeld. These variance ﬁelds can be considered as an optimally smoothed estimate of the
real variance ﬁeld within the context of that particular model. Figure 3 shows these variance ﬁelds for
two of the models. In the top left panel we see the variance ﬁeld for the isotropic model. The main
feature of this ﬁeld is a steep gradient in variance from south to north, with the standard deviation
increasing from around 50km in the trade-wind region to over 100km in the westerlies. In the top right
and bottom left panels we see the variance ﬁelds for the anisotropic correlated model, for along-mean-
track and across-mean-track directions respectively. The along-mean-track variances are slightly greater
than the across-mean-track variances, but both components show the strong north-south gradient seen
in the isotropic model variance ﬁeld.
Finally in the lower right panel we show the correlation between the along and across track deviations
as determined by the optimal lengthscale in the anisotropic correlated model. The correlations are
everywhere rather weak, with values between -0.2 and 0.2. This suggests that the ellipses describing the
probability distribution for the deviations are only slightly rotated relative to the unconditional mean
tracks.
In ﬁgure 4 we show the ratio between the u and v variances from the anisotropic uncorrelated model.
This ratio is mostly positive, implying that errors in the along-mean-track direction are typically greater
than errors in the across-mean-track direction (as can already by seen by comparing the second and third
panels in ﬁgure 3). There is also signiﬁcant spatial structure in this ratio ﬁeld, which is perhaps related
to the typical forward speeds of hurricanes in each region, as shown in ﬁgure 5.

4.3 Simulated tracks

Although we are still ignoring a number of features that are possibly rather important, we now have the
ingredients for a minimal stochastic model for hurricane tracks. Figure 6 shows some tracks generated
from this model. For comparison, one example of a real hurricane track is shown by the blue line, and
other examples are give in ﬁgure 1 in Hall and Jewson (2005). The simulated tracks certainly show some
of the features of observed hurricane tracks: for instance, they move westward in the subtropical Atlantic
and eastward in mid-latitudes. However, it seems clear that these simulated tracks are less smooth than
the observations. Presumably this is because we are ignoring the autocorrelations between successive
deviations along each track. The incorporation of autocorrelations is the next stage in the development
of the model.

5 Summary

In a previous paper we have described a simple semi-parametric statistical model for the unconditional
mean motion of Atlantic hurricanes. In this paper we have investigated how to extend that model to
include the unconditional variance of the motion of the hurricanes too. The three models for the variance
that we describe all rely on a simple nearest-neighbour ﬁtting technique, with the length-scale that deﬁnes
‘near’ being optimised using cross-validation. Of these models, the simplest, which models the deviations
from the unconditional mean track to be variance-isotropic, performs the least well. A model in which
the deviations are modelled to be uncorrelated in directions along and across the unconditional mean
track, but with diﬀerent variances in these two directions, performs much better. Finally a model which
represents the deviations in these two directions as correlated performs better still, and is thus the best
of the models that we have tested.

The cost function we use to ﬁt and compare our models is the out-of-sample likelihood. We propose this
cost function as a sensible and objective way to compare any two hurricane track models. For instance,
the models of Vickery et al. (2000) and Emanuel et al. (2005) could be evaluated and compared with our
model using this cost function. As long as the models are ﬁtted on the same underlying data, and the
cross-validation is performed correctly, this would be a fair way to compare the models.
Using the models described in this paper we can normalise the observed deviations from the unconditional
mean tracks so that they become stationary in variance (as well as mean zero). This will hopefully
make them much easier to model using standard statistical methods (which typically assume stationarity
and constant variance). The next stage of our modelling strategy is therefore to attempt to model
these standardised deviations using well-known time-series techniques such as AR and ARMA, and thus
incorporate memory into the model.

A Likelihood for the anisotropic correlated model

c rather than the correlation r.

B Derivation of an advection-diﬀusion diﬀerential equation

Purely for interest sake we now show that the models described above can be reformulated as an advection-
diﬀusion equation.
Given the stochastic diﬀerential equation in equation 1 one can apply some of the standard machinery
of mathematical physics. In particular, one can derive a partial diﬀerential equation (usually known as
the Fokker-Planck equation or the Kolmogorov equation) that governs the evolution of a density ﬁeld in
space and time (Gardiner, 1985). In our case the density refers to the probability density of hurricanes.
If we write this density as f , and ignore curvature eﬀects, this gives:

∂f (θ, φ, t)
∂t
or, more succintly, as

∂
∂θ

[µθf ] +

2

∂φ2 [σ2f ] +

2

[ρσ2f ]

Slightly more esoterically, there is also a partial diﬀerential equation for the evolution of the probability
density backwards in time (the backward Fokker-Planck or backwards Kolmogorov equation). This can
be written as:

∂
∂φ

∂f
∂t

+ ∇.(µf ) = ∇2

= µ.∇f + σ∇2f

We present these equations mainly for curiosity value. They don’t seem to be particularly useful for
solving the practial problem of modelling hurricane risk since they don’t generalise easily to the case where
there is memory along the trajectory. Also, we are ultimately interested in modelling the intensity along
the track and the damage caused by individual hurricanes, and these also don’t ﬁt into this framework.
However, we ﬁnd the analogy suggested by equation 28 reasonably interesting: the distribution of possible
hurricanes is advected by a mean ﬂow ﬁeld, including the eﬀects of compression and expansion, and is
diﬀused by a diﬀusive ﬁeld. The equation governing this behaviour is exactly the same as the equation
that governs the advection and diﬀusion of the density of a compressible ﬂuid.

curve is the isotropic model.

Figure 2: Diﬀerences between the log-likelihood scores for the three variance models on a year by year
basis. The solid curve shows diﬀerences between the two simplest models: the anisotropic uncorrelated
model and the isotropic model. Since these diﬀerences are almost all positive we conclude that the
anisotropic uncorrelated model beats the isotropic model in almost all years. The dashed line shows the
diﬀerences between the anisotropic correlated model and the anisotropic uncorrelated model. Again the
diﬀerences are mostly positive, and we can conclude that the correlated model beats the uncorrelated
model in most years.

Figure 3: Panel A shows the variance ﬁeld for the isotropic model. Panels B and C show the variance
ﬁeld for the anisotropic uncorrelated model, in the along-mean-track and across-mean-track directions
respectively, and panel D shows the correlations from the anisotropic correlated model.

Figure 4: The ratio of the along-mean-track variances to the across-mean-track variances in the
anisotropic uncorrelated model. This ratio indicates the extent to which the contours of constant prob-
ability density deviate from circles and become elliptical. A value near to 1 indicates the contours are
nearly circular, while a value above 1 indicates that the contours are elliptical, with the longest axis along
the direction of the unconditional mean tracks.

Figure 6: The thin black curves show simulated hurricane tracks from the anisotropic correlated model,
all originating from the same point. The thick red curve shows the unconditional mean track from the
same point, and the blue curve shows an observed hurricane track.

Five year ahead prediction of Sea Surface Temperature in the
Tropical Atlantic: a comparison between IPCC climate models
and simple statistical methods

Abstract

There is a clear positive correlation between boreal summer tropical Atlantic sea-surface temper-
ature and annual hurricane numbers. This motivates the idea of trying to predict the sea-surface
temperature in order to be able to predict future hurricane activity. In previous work we have used
simple statistical methods to make 5 year predictions of tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures
for this purpose. We now compare these statistical SST predictions with SST predictions made by
an ensemble mean of IPCC climate models.

1 Introduction

The insurance and reinsurance industries use predictions of annual numbers of landfalling hurricanes to
help them set the rates on the contracts they sell, and to allocate suﬃcient capital to their businesses.
This creates a need to produce better predictions of future hurricane numbers, especially over the 0-5
year time-scales of interest to these industries. We have been looking into a number of ways of making
such predictions, based on several diﬀerent approaches such as time-series analysis historical landfalling
hurricane data, time-series analysis of basin hurricane number data, and statistical predictions of sea-
surface temperature (SST). In the latter approach, time-series methods are used to predict future SSTs
based on historical SSTs, and the predictions of SST are then converted to predictions of landfalling
hurricane numbers using statistical relations. One obvious question arises: might it not be better to
use numerical models of climate, rather than statistical methods, to predict future SSTs? We feel that
the answer to this question is not at all obvious, and the purpose of this article is to perform an initial
comparison of numerical model predictions with our simple statistical methods. Our approach is to
take simulations of the 20th century climate from a set of integrations of state-of-the-art climate models
that were prepared as part of a submission to the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC:
see www.ipcc.ch), and compare the predictions from these models with those from our own simple
statistical methods.

2 Methods

2.1 Data

We are trying to predict SSTs in the Main Development Region (MDR) for hurricanes, deﬁned as 10o-
20oN, 15o-70oW. From a statistical analysis of the correlation of SSTs in diﬀerent months with observed
hurricane numbers, we choose an index based on the average SST in this region for the period July to
September. This index has one value per year, and extends from 1860 to 2005, although we only use
values from 1900 to 2000. We derive values for this index from the HADISST data set (Rayner et al.,
2002).

2.2 Statistical models

The statistical model we use for this comparison is taken from a comparison of the ability of simple
statistical models to predict this MDR SST index, described in Laepple et al. (2006). The winning model
in this comparison was the ‘8 year ﬂat-line’, which predicts future SSTs using a simple average of SSTs
from the last 8 years. For a 5-year forecast this model beats models with longer and shorter averaging
windows, and beats models that attempt to model any trends in the data. Why does this model do so well?
There is considerable interannual, decadal and multidecadal time-scale variability in the SST index. Since
we are trying to predict SSTs over the next 5 years, and the interannual variability is only predictable
over periods of a few months, making a 5 year prediction is mainly about estimating the current level of
the decadal and interdecadal variability. The 8 year window presumably works because it does this well.
A shorter window would be too inﬂuenced by interannual variability during the windowing period, and
a longer window would presumably fail to capture the current level of the long-term variability.

2.3 Numerical models

The numerical models we use for this comparison are coupled-ocean atmosphere models, running from
eﬀectively random initial conditions in 1900 throughout the 20th century. The models are forced with
estimates of the observed climate forcings in place during the 20th century, the most important of which
are changing levels of CO2, sulphate aerosols, solar variability and volcanic activity.
The methodology we use to make predictions from the climate model output is as follows:

• For each of the 22 coupled climate models simulations of the 20th century available from the IPCC,

we take the 101 year time-series of simulated MDR SST index values.

• We split the simulations into two sets: those that include volcanic forcing, and those that do not

• We create an ensemble mean of the climate model simulations in each set

• In order to create a prediction of real MDR SSTs from year n + 1 onwards, we calculate a bias
correction to the ensemble mean climate model predictions based on the 8 years n−8, n−7, ..., n−1, n

• Applying this bias correction, we then predict future MDR SST values from simulated values for

the years n + 1 onwards.

We calibrate using 8 years of data to make the comparison with the statistical model as clean as possible.
As a result of this calibration, if the climate model predicted constant values it would give exactly the
same prediction as the statistical model. It will give better predictions if the ﬂuctuations produced by
the model are, on average, realistic.
There are two reasons why this methodology might lead to skillful predictions. First, the bias correction
sets the level of any internal variability in the predictions. For instance, if there were a multidecadal
cycle in observed MDR SSTs, the bias correction will put the predictions at the right level within that
cycle. This is essentially the same source of predictive skill as is exploited by the statistical model. Note,
however, that the climate model predictions would not be expected to continue the development of such a
cycle into the future in a realistic way, since they start from random initial conditions, and know nothing
about the phase of any cycles of internal climate variability. Second, to the extent that there is a part
of climate variability that is driven by variations in the external forcings, then the models might be able
to capture that. Most obviously, if the rise in CO2 during the 20th century drives any changes in MDR
SSTs, then the models could in principle reproduce such a change.
By using simulations of past climate, driven by after-the-fact estimates of the forcings, we are eﬀectively
assuming that the forcings driving these models are perfectly predictable, which gives these models a
large unfair and unrealistic advantage over the statistical models. The least predictable of the forcings
is the volcanic forcing, which is in reality totally unpredictable. This is why we split the climate models
into two sets. Comparing the statistical model with the set that doesn’t include volcanoes gives a much
fairer comparison, since the remaining forcing parameters are reasonably predictable. It still, however,
gives a slightly unfair advantage to the climate models.
The climate model simulations of MDR SST from the runs with volcanic forcing are shown in the top
panel of ﬁgure 1, along with the observed MDR SST (solid black line). The climate model simulations of
MDR SST from the runs without volcanic forcing are shown in the lower panel. Figure 2 shows the same
data, but with the range of results from individual climate models shown as the mean plus and minus
one standard deviation. Figure 3 shows the same data again, but smoothed with a 3 year running mean
to emphasize longer timescales. Figures 4 and 5 show the forecast errors for the climate models versus

the length of the calibration period. The optimal calibration period is longest for the shortest lead times.
The 8 year calibration period used for our comparison is apparently optimal for forecasts with lead times
of around 5 years, and seems to be a good overall choice.
Based on the results in ﬁgures 4 and 5 one could consider varying the length of the calibration window
for the climate model according to the lead-time being predicted. One would also then have to vary the
length of the window in the statistical method in a similar way, to keep the comparison fair. We, however,
consider this unnecessarily complex at this point.

3 Results

The results of our comparison between the predictive skill of our simple statistical method and the climate
models are given in ﬁgure 6. The solid black line shows the RMSE of the forecasts from our statistical
model versus lead time. The error in these forecasts gradually increases with lead time, although the
error for 30 year predictions is only around 30% larger than that for 1 year predictions. The extra skill
at one year is presumably because the model is capturing some of the decadal and interdecadal time-
scale variability in the time-series, including any long-term trends. The error at one year is presumably
dominated by the interannual variability in the climate, which is not predicted by this model.
The dashed red line then shows the RMSE of the forecasts derived from the climate models that include
a perfect prediction of future volcanic activity. These models do very slightly better than the statistical
models at all lead times: the errors are around 5% smaller.
The dotted blue line shows the RMSE of the forecasts derived from the climate models that do not include
volcanic activity, but do include a perfect prediction of the other atmospheric forcings. In practice, it is
not possible to predict any of the atmospheric forcings perfectly, and these RMSE values should thus be
considered as artiﬁcially too low, especially at longer lead-times. We see that the climate models do very
slightly better than the statistical model up to around 5 years, and are worse than the statistical model
beyond 5 years.
Figure 6 shows the same results, but now with error bars. We see that at short lead-times the diﬀerences
between the diﬀerent models are not signiﬁcant.
What can we understand from these results, and in particular the result that the climate models without
volcanic forcing don’t perform materially better than the statistical model? The most obvious inter-
pretation is that the non-volcanic climate model simulations contain no information about the direction
that climate is moving. Their skill comes purely from the bias correction, that sets them at the correct
current level for climate. The fact they do progressively worse than the statistical model as the lead time
increases is presumably because of gradual drift in the models.
Why do the climate models do so badly? The two extreme-case explanations are (a) that the models
are perfect representations of the physics of the real climate, but that climate variability is driven by
internal climate variability, rather than externally forced variability, and (b) that the models are very
poor representations of the physics of the real climate, and even if there is some part of climate variability
that is driven by external forcings, the models fail to capture it. Reality is presumably a combination of
these two.
The volcanically forced models, on the other hand, do have some information about which way the climate
moves away from the 8 year baseline. It is clear that these models do have some (albeit retrospective)
skill in capturing the climate response to volcanoes.

4 Conclusions

We are developing methods to predict hurricane numbers over the next 5 years. One class of methods
we are developing is based on the idea of predicting main development region SSTs over this time
period, and then converting those predictions to predictions of hurricane numbers. Hitherto we have
used simple statistical methods to make our SST predictions. In this article, however, we have considered
the possibility of using climate models instead. We have compared predictions made from an ensemble
of state-of-the-art climate models with our statistical predictions. Climate models that include a perfect
prediction of future volcanic activity are the best predictions of those that we consider. Climate models
that ignore volcanic activity, but include a perfect prediction of other climate forcings, do very slightly
better than our statistical models up to a lead time of 5 years, but do increasing less well thereafter. Given
the unfair advantage that using perfect predictions of future atmospheric forcing parameters confers on
the climate models, the tiny margin by which they beat the statistical models, and the vast complexity

of using these models versus using the statistical models, we conclude that the statistical models are
preferable to the climate models over our time period of interest.
We have thus answered our initial question. Should we use IPCC climate model output to feed into our
predictions of future hurricane numbers, rather than the simple statistical methods we currently use?
The answer is no.
What can we say about (a) whether the climate models might one day be preferable to the statistical
models and (b) what this tells us about predictions of climate in the 21st century? Wrt (a), the one
obvious way that the climate model predictions might be improved would be to include realistic, rather
than random, initial conditions. If there really is a component of unforced internal climate variability
that is predictable on decadal and interdecadal time-scales, and the models can simulate it, then their
errors might be reduced. However, whether predictable internal climate variability exists on these long-
timescales is currently unknown, and climate scientists have diﬀerent opinions on this subject. In the
absence of such signals, at short lead-times both the statistical models and the climate models are probably
hitting the limits of predictability deﬁned by the levels of interannual variability in the climate, that is
unpredictable over the time-scales of interest. At long-time scales it seems likely that the climate models
could be signiﬁcantly improved, by the gradual eradication of the slow drift that is presumably driving
the more rapid increase in the climate model errors versus the errors in the statistical model.
Wrt (b), should we extrapolate these results to tell us about the likely skill of future climate predictions?
This is rather hard to answer, since it depends, in part, on what the climate does in the future. But,
prima facie, the suggestion from these results is that statistical models will continue to do as well or better
than climate models in the future. However, what if future climate variability is dominated by single
externally-forced upward trend, as many climate models suggest, rather than by interdecadal variability,
as it has been in the past century? Will the climate models then do any better? Perhaps. Although
at that point statistical models that capture trends would improve as well, and the comparison between
statistical models and climate models would have to be repeated.

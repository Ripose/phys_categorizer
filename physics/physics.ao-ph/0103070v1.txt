Abstract

This paper presents a study of acoustic scattering by a cylinder of either inﬁnite or ﬁnite length near a ﬂat
pressure-release surface. A novel self-consistent method is developed to describe the multiple scattering
interactions between the cylinder and the surface. The complete scattering amplitude for the cylinder
is derived from a set of equations, and is numerically evaluated. The results show that the presence of
the surface can either enhance or reduce the scattering of the cylinder, depending on the frequency, the
composition of the cylinder, and the distance between the cylinder and the surface. Both air-ﬁlled and
rigid cylinders are considered.

INTRODUCTION

Acoustic scattering by underwater objects near a pressure release boundary is a very important issue in a
number of current research and applications, including the modeling of scattering from surface dwelling ﬁsh,
the understanding of oceanic ﬂuxes and ambient noises generated at ocean surface layers. It may also be of
great help in models of acoustic scattering by submarines near the ocean surface.

In the literature, the research on sound scattering by underwater objects near a pressure release surface
has been mainly focused on the scattering by a spherical object such as an air bubble (Refs. e. g. [1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7]). In many important applications, however, underwater objects may not take the spherical geometry.
Rather they often take elongated shapes. This includes, for example, the surface dwelling ﬁsh, the ﬂoating
logs in rivers, military objects, and so on. For these situations, it is desirable to study acoustic scattering
by an elongated object near a boundary. By searching the literature, we ﬁnd that the research along this
line is surprisingly scarce. The purpose of the the present paper is to present an investigation of acoustic
scattering by a cylinder of either inﬁnite or ﬁnite length near a ﬂat pressure-release boundary.

We consider acoustic scattering by an elongated object near a ﬂat pressure release surface; the sea or
river surface can be regarded as one of such surfaces when the acoustic wavelength is long compared to the
surface wave. As a ﬁrst step, for simplicity yet not to compromising the generality, we assume the object as
a straight cylinder. Due to the presence of the surface, the wave will be scattered back and forth between the
surface and the object before it reaches a receiver. The rescattering from the scatterer and rereﬂection from
the surface are studied using a self-consistent method by expressing all the waves in terms of modal series.
The scattering by the cylinder is thus exactly evaluated, and analyzed. The theory is ﬁrst developed for an
inﬁnite cylinder, then extended to ﬁnite cylinders using the genuine approach given by Ref. [8]. Although
the theory allows us to consider a variety of cylinders, in order to show the essence of the theory in its
most transparent way we focus on two important types of cylinders, that is, the air-ﬁlled and the rigid
cylinders. The former can be used to model the ﬁsh while the latter may resemble some acoustic scattering
characteristics of military objects.

I. FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM

The problem considered in this paper is depicted in Fig. 1. A straight cylinder is located in the water at a
depth d beneath a pressure release plane which can be the sea surface. For simplicity, we assume that the
axis of the cylinder is parallel to the plane. The radius of the cylinder is a. The acoustic parameters of the
cylinder are taken as: the mass density ρ1 and sound speed c1, while those of the surround water are ρ and
c; therefore the acoustic contrasts are g = ρ1/ρ and h = c1/c. A parallel line acoustic source transmitting
a wave of frequency ω is at ~rs some distance away from the surface. The transmitted wave is scattered by

1

the cylinder and reﬂected from the surface, as shown in Fig. 1. The reﬂected wave is also scattered by the
cylinder. The wave scattered by the cylinder is again reﬂected by the surface. Such a process is repeated,
establishing an inﬁnite series of rescattering and rereﬂection between the cylinder and the surface. This
multiple scattering process can be conveniently treated by a self-consistent manner. The rectangular frame
is set up in such a way that the z-axis is parallel to the axis of the cylinder. the x-axis and y-axis are shown
in Fig. 1. To solve the scattering problem, however, we use the cylindrical coordinates in the rectangular
system. We note that in the present paper, for brevity we do not consider the case that the incident direction
is oblique to the axis of the cylinder; the extension to oblique cases is straightforward. The setting in the
problem is by analogy with that described in Ref. [7], where a spherical air bubble is placed beneath the ﬂat
boundary.

A. Scattering by a cylinder of inﬁnite length

In this section, we present a formulation for sound scattering by an inﬁnite cylinder near a pressure-release
boundary. For succinctness, we only show the most essential steps in the derivation. First the direct wave
from the line source can be written as

pinc = iπH (1)

0 (k|~r − ~rs|),

with k being the wave number of the transmitted wave (k = ω/c), and H (1)
0 being the zero-th order Hankel
function of the ﬁrst kind. The reason why we choose to use the line source is that it can easily used to include
the usual plane wave situation; for this we just need to put the source at a place so that k|~r − ~rs| >> 1.
Due to the presence of the pressure release surface, the reﬂection from the surface of the direct wave can be
regarded as coming from an image source located symmetrically about the surface, and is written as

where ~rsi is the vector coordinate for the image, which is at the parity position about the plane.

The scattered wave from the cylinder can be generally written as

pr = −iπH (1)

0 (k|~r − ~rsi|),

ps1 =

AnH (1)

n (k|~r − ~r1|)einφ~r−~r1 ,

where An are the coeﬃcients to be determined later, H (1)
are the n-th order Hankel functions of the ﬁrst
n
kind, and φ is the azimuthal angle that sweeps through the plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of
the cylinder. According to Brekhovskikh[9], the eﬀect of the boundary on the cylinder can be represented by
introducing an image cylinder located at the mirror symmetry site about the plane surface. The rereﬂection
and rescattering between the surface and the cylinder can be represented by the multiple scattering between
the cylinder and its image. The scattered wave from this image can be similarly written as

ps2 =

BnH (1)

n (k|~r − ~r2|)einφ~r−~r2 ,

where ~r2 is the location of the image of the cylinder, which is symmetric about the pressure-release plane.
At the pressure release surface, the boundary condition requires ps1 + ps2 = 0, leading to

where we have used the relations

Bn = −A−n,

φ~r−~r1 = π − φ~r−~r2 , and H (1)

n (x) = (−1)nH (1)

Similarly the wave inside the cylinder can be written as

pin =

CnJn(k|~r − ~r1|)einφ~r−~r1 .

Again, Cn are the unknown coeﬃcients, and Jn are the n-th order Bessel functions of the ﬁrst kind.

To solve for the unknown coeﬃcients An (thus Bn) and Cn, we employ the boundary conditions at the
surface of the cylinder. For the purpose, we express all wave ﬁelds in the coordinates with respect to the
position of the cylinder. This can be achieved by using the addition theorem for the Hankel functions

where ~r′ can either be the location of the source by setting ~r′ = ~rs, the location of the image of the source
with ~r′ = ~rsi, or the location of the image of the cylinder with ~r′ = ~r2. The boundary conditions on the
surface of the cylinder state that both the acoustic ﬁeld and the radial displacement be continuous across
the interface. Applying the addition theorem to the expressions for the concerned waves in Eqs. (1), (2),
(4), and (6), then plugging them into the boundary conditions, and after a careful calculation, we are led to
the following equation

B. Scattering by a cylinder of ﬁnite length

In practice, we are often concerned with acoustic scattering by objects of ﬁnite length. Here we consider the
scattering by a ﬁnite cylinder beneath a ﬂat pressure release surface such as the sea plane. The problem of
acoustic scattering by a ﬁnite object has been diﬃcult enough, let alone the presence of a boundary. Exact
solutions only exist for simply shaped objects. Approximate methods have been developed. A review on
various methods for computing sound scattering by an isolated elongated object is presented in Ref. [8].
In this section, we extend the cylinder-method proposed in Ref. [8], devised for an isolated cylinder, to
the present case of a cylinder near a boundary. The reason for choosing this method is that it has been
veriﬁed both theoretically and experimentally that this method is reasonably accurate for a wide range of
situations[10, 11]. This is particularly true for the scenarios discussed in the present paper.

where ~n is an outwardly directed unit vector normal to the surface, and ˆr is the unit vector in the scattering
direction deﬁned as ˆr = ~r/r. Function f (~r, ~ri) refers to the scattering function for incident direction at ~ri
implicit in the scattering ﬁeld ps(~r) and the scattering direction ˆr.

First we consider the scattering from the cylinder. Then in Eq. (14), the ﬁeld ps is the scattering ﬁeld
taking values at the surface of scatterer. According to [8], this can be mimicked by that of an inﬁnite cylinder
of the same radius. On the surface of the cylinder (not the image), from Eq. (3) the scattered ﬁeld can be
expressed as

direction is opposite to the incident direction, i. e. ~r = −~ri.

II. NUMERICAL RESULTS

Some interesting properties are found for acoustic scattering by a cylindrical object beneath a ﬂat pressure
release plane. Two kinds of cylinders are considered: air-ﬁlled and rigid cylinders.

Let us ﬁrst consider the sound scattering by an air-ﬁlled cylinder of length L. Although the theory
developed in the last section allows the study of scattering for arbitrary incident and scattering angles, we
will ﬁrst concentrate on backscattering. In addition, without notiﬁcation we will consider the incident at
an angle of π/4 with respect to the normal to the ﬂat surface. Fig. 2 shows the reduced backscattering
target strength in an arbitrary unit as a function of frequency in terms of the non-dimensional parameter
ka. The cylinder is placed at the depths of d/a = 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 respectively. For comparison, the
situation that the boundary is absent is also plotted. Without boundary, the scattering by a single cylinder
has a resonant peak at about ka = 0.005. When a ﬂat pressure-plane is added, the scattering from the
cylinder will be greatly suppressed for most frequencies under consideration, except for the resonance. At
the resonance, the scattering is in fact enhanced by the presence of the surface. This is a unique feature for
the cylinder situation. Another eﬀect of the boundary is to shift the resonance peak of the cylinder towards
higher frequencies. As the distance between the cylinder and the surface is decreased, the position of the
peak moves further towards higher frequencies, and the resonance peak is becoming narrower and narrower.
Before the resonance peak, there is a prominent dip in the scattering strength. For the extreme case that
the cylinder touches the boundary, the signiﬁcant dip appears immediately before the resonance. This dip
is not observed in the case of a spherical bubble beneath a boundary[7].

When the distance between the cylinder and the surface is increased, the resonance peak moves to lower
frequencies until reaching that of the cylinder without a boundary. In Fig. 3, the reduced target strength
is plotted against ka for d/a = 25, 50, and 100. Here we see that, as the cylinder is moved further from
the surface, regular oscillatory features appear in the scattering strength around the values without the
boundary. The observed peaks and nulls are mainly due to interference eﬀects between the cylinder and
the boundary, as these oscillatory features persist even when the multiple scattering is turned oﬀ. The
nulls, appearing at some frequency intervals, are more numerous and are spaced more closely together as the
cylinder is moved away from the boundary. The peak and null structures are somewhat in accordance with
the Lloyd’s mirror eﬀect. These features are in analogy with the results shown for the case of a spherical
bubble beneath the boundary [7]. However, there is a distinct diﬀerence. Namely, the separation between
the peaks or between the nulls decreases as the frequency increases.

We have also studied the contributions from diﬀerent oscillation modes of a cylinder to the scattering.
From Eq. (27), it is clear that the scattering is contributed from various vibration modes and the contributions
are represented by the summation in which the index n denotes the modes. We ﬁnd that when the cylinder
is located far enough from the surface, the scattering is dominated by n = 0 mode for low frequencies (e. g.
ka < 1); mode n = 0 is the omni-directional pulsating mode of the cylinder, i. e. its scattering is uniform in
every direction. When the cylinder is moved close to the surface, higher vibration modes become important.
These properties are illustrated in Fig. 4. For the extreme case that the cylinder touches the boundary as
shown in Fig. 4(a), the result from including only n = 0 mode is compared with that including all modes.
It is interesting to see that the eﬀect of coupling the pulsating mode with other modes is only to shift the
resonance and dip peaks. For low frequencies away from the resonance and the dip, the eﬀect from higher
models is not evident. As the cylinder is move away from the surface, the eﬀect of higher modes gradually
decreases. For the case d/a = 4, the eﬀect of higher modes (i. e. |n| ≥ 2) virtually diminished.

The eﬀects of the incident angle on the back scattering is shown by Fig. 5. The results show that the
scattering is highly anisotropic except at the scattering dip and peak positions; note the scale used in plotting
Fig. 5. The fact that the scattering dip does not rely on the incident angle implies that it is not caused by
the Lloyd mirror eﬀect. This is because if it were due to the Lloyd mirror eﬀect, diﬀerent incident angles
would lead to diﬀerent acoustic paths in reﬂection and incidence and thus result in diﬀerent phases, causing
the scattering pattern to vary.

Next we consider scattering from a rigid cylinder beneath a pressure release boundary. For the rigid
cylinder, in contrast to the air cylinder case, the scattering is not so signiﬁcantly reduced by the presence

5

of the surface. Instead, it is interesting that the presence of the surface in fact can enhance the scattering
strength for most frequencies, except for the frequencies at which the Lloyd eﬀect comes into function. This
enhancement is particularly obvious in the low frequency regime. Similar to the air cylinder case, when the
distance is large enough, the Lloyd mirror eﬀect causes the scattering strength to oscillate around the values
without the boundary for low frequencies. Fig. 6 shows that for low frequencies, the frequency dependence
of the scattering is similar for diﬀerent distances between the cylinder and the surface. For high frequencies,
e. g. ka > 0.4, the multiple scattering is evident and is shown to increase the scattering strength.

The backscattering by the rigid cylinder under the boundary is anisotropic. This is illustrated in Fig. 7,
which shows the backscattering target strength as a function of ka for diﬀerent incidence angles. The
separation between he cylinder and the surface is d/a = 4, and the incidence angle is measured with respect
to the x-axis, referring to Fig. 1. For low frequencies, i. e. ka < 0.1, the scattering is strongest when the
incidence is normal to the surface (i. e. for the zero degree incidence). Diﬀerent from the above air cylinder
case, the dips in the scattering strength depend on the incident angles.

Finally we consider the bistatic scattering. The scattering is in the x − y plane (See Fig. 1). We ﬁx the
incident angle at 45 degree with respect to the normal to the boundary. The scattering azimuthal angle is
measured from the negative direction of the x-axis (Referring to Fig. 1). Fig. 8 shows the scattering angle
dependence of the bistatic scattering target strength for the air ﬁlled and rigid cylinders respectively. It is
interesting to see that when the frequency is low, the scattering tends to be symmetric around the normal to
the boundary, i. e. the zero degree scattering angle, for both the air-ﬁlled and rigid cylinders. The scattering
is strongest at the zero scattering angles. This result indicates that when the frequency is low, the scattering
from a cylinder near a boundary bears similar properties of the acoustic radiation from a dipole source,
independent of the incident angle. This feature seems against the intuition at the ﬁrst sight, but can be
understood as follows. The scattering from a target can be regarded as a second source radiating waves into
the space. From, for instance, Eq. (3), we know that the radiated wave consists of the contributions from all
vibration modes of the cylinder. The mode of n = 0 is the monopole which radiates an omni-directional wave.
At low frequencies, this monopole radiation dominates. In the low frequency regime, both the cylinder and
its image radiate waves but in the opposite phase. If the monopole mode dominates, the resulting radiation
should appear as that from a dipole source: the strongest radiation is along the dipole axis. This is in fact
exactly what is shown by Fig. 8. Comparing Figs. 5 with 7, however, the fact that the bacskscattering relies
on the incident angle indicates that the overall bistatic scattering does depend on the incident angle. When
the frequency is increased to a certain extent, the bistatic scattering pattern is no longer symmetric around
the normal to the boundary.

III. SUMMARY

In this paper, we considered acoustic scattering by cylinders near a pressure-release boundary. A novel
method has been developed to describe the multiple scattering between the boundary and the cylinder in
terms of an inﬁnite modal series. The complete solution has been derived. Although the theory developed
allows for study of various cylinders, for brevity only the cases of air-ﬁlled and rigid cylinders are considered.
The numerical results show that the presence of the boundary modiﬁes the scattering strength in various
ways. One of the most signiﬁcant discoveries is that the present of the surface can greatly suppress the
scattering from ‘soft’ targets while may enhance rigid bodies. In addition, comparison has been made with
the previously investigated case of a spherical air-bubble beneath a pressure-release boundary. The study
presented here may link to various applications such as acoustic scattering from ocean-surface dwelling ﬁsh
or from any underwater elongated objects including submarine.

Abstract

Within a simple model context, the sensitivity and stability of the ther-

mohaline circulation to ﬁnite amplitude perturbations is studied. A new

approach is used to tackle this nonlinear problem. The method is based on

the computation of the so-called Conditional Nonlinear Optimal Pertur-

bation (CNOP) which is a nonlinear generalization of the linear singular

vector approach (LSV). It is shown that linearly stable thermohaline cir-

culation states can become nonlinearly unstable and the properties of the

perturbations with optimal nonlinear growth are determined. An asym-

metric nonlinear response to perturbations exists with respect to the sign

of ﬁnite amplitude freshwater perturbations, on both thermally dominated

and salinity dominated thermohaline ﬂows. This asymmetry is due to the

nonlinear interaction of the perturbations through advective processes.

1 Introduction

A recurrent theme in fundamental research on climate variability is the sensitiv-

ity of the ocean’s thermohaline circulation. When state-of-the-art climate models

are used to calculate projections of future climate states as a response to diﬀer-

ent emission scenarios of greenhouse gases, a substantial spread in the model

results is found. One of the reasons of this spread is the diverse behavior of the

thermohaline circulation (McAvaney, 2001).

The sensitivity of the thermohaline circulation is caused by several feedbacks

induced by the physical processes that determine the evolution of the thermoha-

line ﬂow. One of these feedbacks is the salt-advection feedback which is caused by

the fact that salt is transported by the thermohaline ﬂow, but in turn inﬂuences

the density diﬀerence which drives this ﬂow. The salt-advection feedback can be

conceptually understood in a two-box model (Stommel, 1961) where it is shown

to cause multiple equilibria and hysteresis behavior.

In many models of the global ocean circulation, it appears that several equilib-

rium states may exist under similar forcing conditions. When the present equilib-

rium state, with about 16 Sv Atlantic overturning, is subjected to a quasi-steady

freshwater input in the North Atlantic, eventually the circulation may collapse. In

this collapsed state, there is deepwater formation in the Southern Ocean instead of

in the North Atlantic and the formation of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW)

has ceased (Stocker et al., 1992; Rahmstorf, 1995; Manabe and Stouﬀer, 1999).

As this multiple equilibrium regime seems to be present in many ocean models,

it is important to determine whether transitions between the diﬀerent states can

occur due to ﬁnite amplitude perturbations.

In a variant of the Stommel-model for which the temperature relaxation is

fast, Cessi (1994) studied the transition behavior between the diﬀerent equilibria.

3

In this case, there are only three equilibrium states, of which one unstable. In the

deterministic case, she ﬁnds that a ﬁnite amplitude perturbation of the freshwater

ﬂux can shift the system into an alternate state and that the minimum amplitude

depends on the duration of the disturbance. Regardless of the duration, however,

the amplitude of the disturbance has to exceed a certain value for a transition

to occur. Under stochastic white-noise forcing, there are occasional transitions

from one equilibrium to another as well as ﬂuctuations around each state.

In Timmermann and Lohmann (2000), the eﬀect of multiplicative noise (through

fast ﬂuctuations in the meridional thermal temperature gradient) on the variabil-

ity in a box model similar to that in Cessi (1994) has been studied. It was found

that the stability properties of the thermohaline circulation depend on the noise

level. Red noise can introduce new equilibria that do not have a deterministic

counterpart.

Another line of studies uses box models that show intrinsic variability because

of the existence of an oscillatory mode in the eigenspectrum of the linear oper-

ator. Griﬃes and Tziperman (1995) show that noise is able to excite an other-

wise damped eigenmode of the thermohaline circulation. Tziperman and Ioannou

(2002) study the non-normal growth of perturbations on the thermally driven

state and identify two physical mechanisms associated with the transient ampli-

ﬁcation of these perturbations.

Stochastic noise can have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the mean states of the thermo-

haline circulation and their stability (Hasselmann, 1976; Palmer, 1995; V´elez-Belch´ı et al.,

2001; Tziperman and Ioannou, 2002). Some of these mechanisms are intrinsically

linear, such as the eﬀects of non-normal growth considered in Tziperman and Ioannou

(2002). Others are essentially nonlinear mechanisms, such as those causing the

noise-induced transitions reported in Timmermann and Lohmann (2000).

To study linear ampliﬁcation mechanisms, the linear singular vector (LSV)

4

method is often used, with main applications to predictability studies (Xue and Zebiak,

1997a,b; Thompson, 1998). Knutti and Stocker (2002), for example, found that

the sensitivity of the ocean circulation to perturbations severely limits the pre-

dictability of the future thermohaline circulation when approaching the bifurca-

tion point. The LSV approach, however, cannot provide critical boundaries on

ﬁnite amplitude stability of the thermohaline ocean circulation.

In a system which potentially has multiple equilibria and internal oscillatory

modes, its response to a ﬁnite amplitude perturbation on a particular steady

state is a diﬃcult nonlinear problem. In this paper, we determine the nonlinear

stability boundaries of linearly stable thermohaline ﬂow states within a simple

box model of the thermohaline circulation. To compute these boundaries, we

use the concept of the Conditional Nonlinear Optimal Perturbation (CNOP) and

study optimal nonlinear growth over a certain given time τ . We extend results on

linear optimal growth properties of perturbations on both thermally and salinity

dominated thermohaline ﬂows to the nonlinear case. We ﬁnd that there is an

asymmetric nonlinear response of these ﬂows with respect to the sign of the

ﬁnite amplitude freshwater perturbation and describe a physical mechanism that

explains this asymmetry.

2 Model and methodology

a. Model

To illustrate the approach, the theory is applied to a 2-box model of the thermo-

haline circulation (Stommel, 1961). This model consists of an equatorial box and

a polar box which contain well mixed water of diﬀerent temperatures and salin-

ities due to an equatorial-to-pole gradient in atmospheric surface forcing. Flow

between the boxes is assumed proportional to the density diﬀerence between the

boxes and, with a linear equation of state, related to the temperature and salinity

diﬀerences in the boxes.

be written as

When the balances of heat and salt are nondimensionalized, the governing

dimensionless equations (we use the notation in chapter 3 of Dijkstra (2000)) can

= η1 − T (1+ | T − S |)

(1a)

(1b)

where T = Te − Tp, S = Se − Sp are the dimensionless temperature and salinity

diﬀerence between the equatorial and polar box and Ψ = T − S is the dimension-

less ﬂow rate. Three parameters appear in the equations (1): the parameter η1

measures the strength of the thermal forcing, η2 that of the freshwater forcing and

η3 is the ratio of the relaxation times of temperature and salinity to the surface

forcing. Steady states of the equations (1) are indicated with a temperature of

¯T , a salinity of ¯S and a ﬂow rate ¯Ψ = ¯T − ¯S. A steady state is called thermally-

dominated when ¯Ψ > 0, i.e. a negative equatorial-to-pole temperature gradient

exists dominating the density. A steady state is called salinity-dominated when

¯Ψ < 0, i.e. a negative equatorial-to-pole salinity gradient exists dominating the

density.

It is well known that the equations (1) have multiple steady states for certain

parameter values. Here, we ﬁx η1 = 3.0, η3 = 0.2 and use η2 as control parameter.

The bifurcation diagram for these parameter values is shown in Fig. 1 as a plot

of ¯Ψ versus η2. Solid curves indicate linearly stable steady states, whereas the

states on the dashed curve are unstable. There are thermally-driven (hereafter

TH) stable steady states ( ¯Ψ > 0) and salinity-driven (hereafter SA, ie., the

circulation is salinity-dominated) stable steady states ( ¯Ψ < 0). The saddle-node

bifurcation points occur at η2 = 0.600 and η2 = 1.052, and bound the interval

in η2 where multiple equilibria occur. Suppose that this bifurcation diagram
represents both the present overturning state (on the stable branch with ¯Ψ > 0)

and the collapsed state (on the stable branch with ¯Ψ < 0). To study the nonlinear

transition behavior of the thermohaline ﬂows from the TH state to the SA state

and vice versa, we consider the evolution of ﬁnite amplitude perturbations on the

The nonlinear equation governing the evolution of perturbations can be de-

rived from equation (1).

S′ = S − ¯S are the perturbations of temperature and salinity, then it is found

= −(2| ¯Ψ| + η3)S′ + sign( ¯Ψ)[ ¯T S′ − ¯ST ′ − S′(T ′ − S′)]

where sign( ¯Ψ) is sign of steady ﬂow rate ¯Ψ. If the perturbations are suﬃciently

small, such that the nonlinear part of the equations (2) can be neglected, we ﬁnd

the tangent linear equation governing the evolution of small perturbations as

b. Conditional Nonlinear Optimal Perturbation

To study nonlinear mechanisms of ampliﬁcation, Berloﬀ and Meacham (1996)

modiﬁed the LSV technique and Mu (2000) proposed the concept of nonlin-

ear singular vectors (NSVs) and nonlinear singular values (NSVAs). These con-

cepts were successfully applied by Mu and Wang (2001) and Durbiano (2001) to

study ﬁnite amplitude stability of ﬂows in two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic and

7

shallow-water models, respectively. In Mu and Duan (2003), the concept of the

conditional nonlinear optimal perturbation (CNOP) was introduced and applied

to study the “spring predictability barrier” in the El Nino-Southern Oscillation

(ENSO), using a simple equatorial ocean-atmosphere model. The “spring pre-

dictability barrier” refers to the dramatical decline of the prediction skills for

most of the ENSO models during the Northern Hemisphere (NH) springtime.

The CNOP can also be employed to estimate the prediction errors of an El Ni˜no

or a La Ni˜na event (Mu et al., 2003).

As readers may not be familiar with this concept, we give a brief introduction

to CNOP. Considering the nonlinear evolution of initial perturbations governed

by (2). In general, assume that the equations governing the evolution of pertur-

bations can be written as:
∂x
∂t
x |t=0 = x 0,




+ F (x ; ¯x ) = 0,



in Ω × [0, te]

(4)

where t is time, x (t) = (x1(t), x2(t), ..., xn(t)) is the perturbation state vector
and F is a nonlinear diﬀerentiable operator. Furthermore, x 0 is the initial per-
turbation, ¯x is the basic state, (x , t) ∈ Ω × [0, te] with Ω a domain in Rn, and

te < +∞.

Suppose the initial value problem (4) is well-posed and the nonlinear propa-

gator M is deﬁned as the evolution operator of (4) which determines a trajectory

from the initial time t = 0 to time te. Hence, for ﬁxed te > 0, the solution

x (te) = M(x 0; ¯x )(te) is well-deﬁned, i.e.

x (te) = M(x 0; ¯x )(te)

(5)

So x (te) describes the evolution of the initial perturbation x 0.

For a chosen norm k · k measuring x , the perturbation x

0δ is called the

(7)

The CNOP is the initial perturbation whose nonlinear evolution attains the

maximal value of the functional J at time te with the constraint conditions;

in this sense we call it “optimal”. The CNOP can be regarded as the most

(nonlinearly) unstable initial perturbation superposed on the basic state. With

the same constraint conditions, the larger the nonlinear evolution of the CNOP

is, the more unstable the basic state is. In general, it is diﬃcult to obtain an

analytical expression of the CNOP. Instead we look for the numerical solution,

by solving a constraint nonlinear optimization problem.

To calculate the CNOP the norm

kx 0k =

is used. Using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme with a time step dt = 0.001,

perturbation solutions (T ′, S′) are obtained numerically by integrating the model

(2) up to a time te and the magnitude of the perturbation is calculated. Next,

the Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) method is applied to obtain the

CNOP numerically; the SQP method is brieﬂy described in the Appendix.

To compare the CNOPs with the LSVs, the latter are also computed using

the theory of linear singular vector analysis (Chen et al., 1997). We also use the

norm (8) in this analysis and ﬁrst solve (3) to obtain the linear evolution of initial

perturbations. Subsequently, the singular vector decomposition (SVD) is used to

determine the linear singular vectors (LSVs) of the model.

3 Stability and sensitivity analysis

In this section, we compute the CNOPs to study the sensitivity of the thermoha-

line circulation to ﬁnite amplitude freshwater perturbations in the two-box model.

Two problems are studied: (i) the nonlinear development of the ﬁnite amplitude

perturbations for ﬁxed parameters in the model and (ii) the nonlinear stability of

the steady states as parameters are changed. Both thermally-dominated steady

states ( ¯Ψ > 0) and salinity-dominated ones ( ¯Ψ < 0) are investigated. The ini-

tial perturbation x 0 is written as x 0 = (T ′

0, S′

0) = (δ cos θ, δ sin θ) , where δ is

magnitude of initial perturbation and θ the angle of the initial vector with the

x-axis.

3.1 Finite amplitude evolution of the TH state

For the thermally-driven stable steady state, we consider the state ¯T = 1.875, ¯S =

1.275, ¯Ψ = 0.6 (shown as point ”A” in Fig. 1) with the ﬁxed parameters η1 = 3.0,

η2 = 1.02, η3 = 0.2. We choose te = 2.5 and use δ = 0.3 as a maximum norm

(in the norm (8)) of the perturbations. The time te is about half the time the

solution takes to equilibrate to steady state from a particular initial perturbation.

The amplitude δ = 0.3 is about 10% of the typical amplitude of the steady state

of temperature and salinity ( ¯T , ¯S). For θ in the range π/4 < θ < 5π/4, the initial

perturbation ﬂow has Ψ′(0) < 0. As this is typically caused by a freshwater ﬂux

perturbation in the polar box, we refer to the perturbation as being of freshwater

type. For other angles θ ∈ [0, 2π] , the initial perturbation ﬂow has Ψ′(0) > 0,

which is typically caused by a salt ﬂux perturbation in the polar box and we refer

to it as being of salinity type.

Using equation (2) and (3), both CNOPs and LSVs are computed versus

the constraint condition δ, respectively. The numerical results, plotted in Fig. 2,

10

indicate that the CNOPs are located at the circle kx 0k = δ, which is the boundary
of ball kx 0k ≤ δ. The directions of the LSVs, which are independent of δ, have

constant values of θ1 = 1.948 (dashed line) and θ2 = 5.089 (not shown). The value

of θ for the CNOPs (solid curve) increases monotonically over the δ interval 0.01

to 0.3. The diﬀerence between CNOPs and LSVs is relatively small when δ is

small.

Integrating the model (2) with CNOPs and LSVs as initial conditions, respec-

tively. we obtain their evolutions at time te, which are denoted as ”CNOP-N” and

”LSV-N”; these are shown in Fig. 3. For comparison, the linear evolution of the

LSVs are also obtained by integrating the model (3) with the LSV as an initial

condition; this is denoted as ”LSV-L” in Fig. 3. It is clear that the evolution of

the CNOPs is nonlinear in δ, while ”LSV-L” only increases linearly. The line of

”LSV-N” is between ”CNOP-N” and ”LSV-L”, but the diﬀerence between ”LSV-

N” and ”CNOP-N” is hardly distinguishable over the whole δ interval. Though

this diﬀerence is not signiﬁcant in this TH state, it is signiﬁcant in the following

investigation for SA state. In fact, it is very hard to know this without previous

calculation.

Note that since our numerical results demonstrate that the CNOPs are all

located on the boundary kx 0k = δ, we are able to show the sensitivity of THC

to ﬁnite amplitude perturbations of speciﬁc ﬁxed amplitude δ = 0.2. In Fig. 4

the value of J at te = 2.5 is shown for the linear and the nonlinear evolutions

of the initial perturbations obtained by (2) and (3). For the linear case (dashed

line in Fig. 4), there are two optimal linear initial perturbations θ1 = 1.948 and

θ2 = 5.089 with the same value of J, J(δ, θ1) = J(δ, θ2) = 0.16484, which are the

LSVs. Note that θ2 − θ1 = π, which means that in the linear case perturbations

with Ψ′ > 0 and Ψ′ < 0 behave similarly (and hence symmetrically with respect

to the sign of Ψ′). For the nonlinear model (solid curve in Fig. 4), there is one

11

global optimal nonlinear initial perturbation with θ3 = 1.979, which is the CNOP,

and one local optimal nonlinear initial perturbations at θ4 = 5.058, with values

of J(δ, θ3) = 0.22413 and J(δ, θ4) = 0.13052, respectively. The results in Fig. 4

for δ = 0.2 coincide with the results in Fig. 2.

There is another diﬀerence between the linear and nonlinear evolution of the

perturbations. When the initial perturbations are freshwater (Ψ′ < 0), the non-

linear evolution leads to a larger amplitude than the linear evolution. When the

initial perturbations are saline (Ψ′ > 0), the nonlinear evolution leads to a smaller

amplitude than the linear evolution. For example, the initial perturbations with

θ1 and θ3 are such that Ψ′ < 0, while the initial perturbations with θ2 and θ4

have Ψ′ > 0.

The values of J/δ obtained by integrating (2) with the CNOPs as initial

condition are shown for diﬀerent δ in Fig. 5a. The corresponding evolution of Ψ

is plotted in Fig. 5b. To relate the result in Fig. 5a to previous ones, consider

the value of J/δ at t = 2.5 on the curve of δ = 0.2. In Fig. 4, the maximum of

J is 0.224 and hence J/δ = 0.224/0.2 = 1.12. It follows from the Figs. 5 that for

the CNOP with δ = 0.01, the ﬂow rate Ψ recovers to the steady state ¯Ψ = 0.6

rapidly. For the CNOP with a larger initial amplitude (δ = 0.1, 0.2), it takes

much longer for the thermohaline circulation to recover to steady state. This is

diﬀerent from a linear analysis where the evolution is the same for all optimal

initial perturbations (Tziperman and Ioannou, 2002).

In summary, the results for the TH state show that fresh perturbations, with

Ψ′ < 0, are more ampliﬁed though nonlinear mechanisms than saline perturba-

tions, with Ψ′ > 0. This is consistent with the notion that perturbations which

move the system towards a bifurcation point will be more ampliﬁed through

non-linear mechanisms than perturbations that move the system away from a

bifurcation point.

12

3.2 Finite amplitude stability of the SA state

We consider the salinity-dominated SA state ( ¯T = 2.674, ¯S = 2.796, ¯Ψ = −0.122)

for a slightly smaller value of η2 than for the thermally-dominated TH state in

the previous section (η1 = 3.0, η2 = 0.9, η3 = 0.2). It is indicated as point ”B”

in Fig. 1. Again for the time te = 2.5, using the corresponding equations (2)

and (3), both CNOPs and LSVs are computed versus the constraint condition δ,

respectively and the results are plotted in Fig. 6.

Similar to the results in Fig. 2, the directions of the LSVs, which are indepen-

dent of δ, have constant values of θ1 = 2.796 and θ2 = 5.938 (dashed line). The

line for θ1 is similar to θ2, and is not drawn in Fig. 6. The direction of CNOPs

(solid curve) increase monotonously with δ varying from 0.01 to 0.125. Then,

θ drops down to 2.857 at δ = 0.125 and increase slightly with δ in the interval

0.125 < δ < 0.17. After that, θ jumps up to 5.195 at δ = 0.17 and increases

slightly with δ in 0.17 < δ < 0.22.

Using equations (2) and (3), the evolutions of both the CNOPs and LSVs

of the SA state are shown in Fig. 7. All the three kinds of evolutions are ap-

proximately the same when the initial perturbations are relatively small. But

for larger δ the diﬀerence between ”LSV-N” and ”CNOP-N” is remarkably larger

than that of the TH state (Fig. 3). The values of J of ”CNOP-N” are always

larger than those of both ”LSV-L” and ”LSV-N” for δ > 0.17.

The values of J at a time te = 2.5 for all θ show (Fig. 8a) two optimal

linear initial perturbations θ1 = 2.796 and θ2 = 5.938 with J(δ, θ1) = J(δ, θ2) =

0.0526. Again, because θ2 − θ1 = π there is the symmetry in response with

respect to the sign of Ψ′. For nonlinear evolutions, there is one globally optimal

initial perturbation at θ3 = 5.246 (the CNOP) and two locally optimal initial

perturbations at θ4 = 0.251 and θ5 = 2.890, with J-values of J(δ, θ3) = 0.0963,

13

J(δ, θ4) = 0.0432 and J(δ, θ5) = 0.0503, respectively. The initial perturbations

with θ1 and θ5 are of freshwater type (Ψ′ < 0), while the initial perturbations of

θ2, θ3 and θ4 are of salinity type (Ψ′ > 0).

To understand the diﬀerence between the maxima located at θ3, θ4 and θ5, a

contour graph of J(θ, δ) is drawn in Fig. 8b. It is clear from Fig. 8b that there

are three groups of local maxima which are indicated by the dashed lines. When

δ < 0.125 there are only two local maxima and the CNOP is located in the regime

5π/4 < θ < 2π. When 0.125 < δ < 0.17, the CNOP jumps from the interval

5π/4 < θ < 2π to the interval 3π/4 < θ < 5π/4. This coincides with the jumping

behavior of θ in Fig. 6. When δ > 0.17, there are three local maxima and the

CNOP jumps from the interval 3π/4 < θ < 5π/4 to a new interval 5 < θ < 6.

Both jumps are also shown in Fig. 6 and J has a remarkable increase after the

second jump (Fig. 7).

Also for the SA state, the value of J/δ along trajectories obtained by integrat-

ing equations (2) using the CNOPs as initial conditions are shown for diﬀerent δ

in Fig. 9a. The corresponding evolution of Ψ is plotted in Fig. 9b. For t = 2.5

and δ = 0.2, the value of J/δ = 0.0963/0.2 = 0.48, where 0.0963 is the maximum

in Fig. 8a. The ﬂow rate Ψ recovers to the steady state (whose value is −0.122)

shortly after being disturbed with a small amplitude CNOP (δ = 0.01). It takes

much longer for the thermohaline circulation to recover to the steady state after

being disturbed with a larger amplitude (δ = 0.1, 0.2), respectively. The larger

the CNOP is, the larger the transient eﬀect. In contrast to the TH state, there

is now an oscillatory attraction to the SA state, already described in Stommel

(1961).

In both the salinity-dominated SA state and the thermally-dominated TH

state, the CNOP always moves the system towards the bifurcation point. The SA

state (TH state) has an asymmetry in the nonlinear ampliﬁcation of disturbances,

14

with a larger ampliﬁcation for those with Ψ′ > 0 (Ψ′ < 0).

3.3 Sensitivity along the bifurcation diagram

Even if a TH or SA state is linearly stable, it can become nonlinearly unstable

due to ﬁnite amplitude perturbations. The methodology of CNOP provides a

means to assess the nonlinear stability thresholds of the thermohaline ﬂows; here

this is shown for the two-box model (2). Thereto, we compute the CNOPs under

diﬀerent δ constraints for linearly stable TH and SA states along the bifurcation

diagram in Fig. 1.

Along the TH branch, we vary η2 from 1.043 to 1.046 with step 0.001 and

thereby approach the saddle-node bifurcation (Fig. 1). For each value of η2, the

CNOPs are obtained under the constraint that the magnitude of initial pertur-

bations is less 0.2 (δ = 0.2) and again the time te = 2.5. The trajectories of

the CNOPs are calculated by integrating the model (2) (Fig. 10a). Next, the

corresponding ﬂow rates Ψ are drawn in Fig. 10b. Both ﬁgures indicate that the

CNOPs damp after a while for the steady states labelled A1, A2 and A3. While

these three states are consequently nonlinearly stable, the CNOP for steady state

A4 (η2 = 1.046) increases in time, which implies that this steady state is nonlin-

early unstable (although it is linearly stable) to perturbations with δ = 0.2.

From the above results, it follows that for each value of η2, in the multiple

equilibria regime of Fig. 1, a critical value of δ, say δc, must exists such that the

TH state is nonlinearly unstable. δc is deﬁned as the smallest magnitude of a

ﬁnite amplitude perturbation which induces a transition from the TH state to

the SA state. The larger the value of δc, the more stable the steady state is.

Using the CNOP method, the values of δc can be computed and the results for

the TH states (from η2 = 0.95 up to the saddle-node bifurcation at η2 = 1.052

15

) are shown in Fig. 11. The curve separates the plane into two parts. For the

regime under the curve the steady state is nonlinearly stable and for the regime

above the curve it is nonlinearly unstable. When the bifurcation point Q in Fig. 1

is approached, δc decrease more and more quickly. The critical value δc reduces

to zero sharply, as η2 approaches the bifurcation point. This explains how the

steady states lose their stability when the bifurcation point Q is reached.

The same calculations are performed for steady states on the SA branch, when

η2 varies from 0.75 to the value 0.60 at the saddle-node bifurcation. The CNOPs

are obtained under the constraint that the magnitude of initial perturbations is

less than 0.1 (δ = 0.1) with time te = 2.5. The trajectories of the CNOPs at

each steady state (of which J and Ψ are plotted in Fig. 12) indicate that the

CNOPs damp for the steady states labelled B1, B2 and B3. Although there is

oscillatory behavior, these states are nonlinearly stable. However, the evolution

of CNOP for steady state B4 (η2 = 0.70) increases, which implies that the SA

state is nonlinearly unstable to this ﬁnite amplitude perturbation (although it is

linearly stable).

The critical boundaries δc for the SA states (Fig. 13) show that δc decreases

monotonically with η2 and becomes zero at saddle-node bifurcation (η2 = 0.6).

Similar to Fig. 11, the curve separates the plane into two parts. For the regime

under the curve the steady state is nonlinearly stable and for the regime above

the curve it is nonlinearly unstable. When η2 decreases from 1.0 to 0.6, the SA

steady states approach the bifurcation point P in Fig. 1, and the critical value

δc tends to zero. This explains how the steady states lose their stability at the

bifurcation point P .

4 Summary and Discussion

Within a simple two-box model, we have addressed the sensitivity and nonlinear

stability of (linearly stable) steady states of the thermohaline circulation. One of

the remarkable results obtained by the CNOP approach is the asymmetry in the

nonlinear ampliﬁcation of perturbations with Ψ′ < 0 (interpreted as a freshwater

perturbation in the northern North Atlantic) and Ψ′ > 0 (interpreted as a salt

perturbation in the northern North Atlantic).

When we use LSV analysis, there are two singular vectors x1 and −x1 that

correspond to one singular value σ1 (see Fig. 4 and Fig. 8a). If x1 is a freshwater

type perturbation ( Ψ′ < 0 ), −x1 must be a salinity type perturbation ( Ψ′ > 0 ).

The conclusion from the linear analysis (using LSV) is that the thermohaline cir-

culation is equally sensitive to either freshwater or salinity entering the northern

North Atlantic. However, the nonlinear analysis (using CNOP) clearly reveals a

diﬀerence in the response of the system to the two types of perturbations.

The asymmetry can be understood by considering the nonlinear evolution of

perturbations in the two-box model. For the TH state, according to (2), the ﬂow

rate perturbation Ψ′ = T ′ − S′ satisﬁes

dΨ′
dt

= (2 ¯S − 2 ¯T − 1)T ′ + (2 ¯T − 2 ¯S + η3)S′ − Ψ′2

(9)

Integrating the above equation, we ﬁnd

Ψ′(t) = Ψ′(0) +

L(T ′, S′)dτ −

Ψ′2dτ

(10)

where L(T ′, S′) is the linear part of (9). It is well known that the two linear terms

in (9) determine the linear stability of the steady state (Stommel, 1961).

For an initial perturbation Ψ′(0) < 0 (freshwater type), the nonlinear term is

always negative and the freshwater perturbation is ampliﬁed. This is a positive

feedback and the stronger the freshwater perturbation, the stronger the nonlinear

17

feedback destabilizing the TH steady state. A perturbation Ψ′(0) > 0 (salinity

type) is damped by the negative deﬁnite nonlinear term. This is a negative

feedback and the stronger the salinity perturbation, the stronger the nonlinear

feedback stabilizing the TH state. Nonlinear mechanisms hence make the TH

steady state more stable to salinity perturbations.

This explains the results in Fig. 4. For the freshwater type initial perturba-

tions (Ψ′ < 0), the nonlinear evolution of the initial perturbation of (2) is larger

than the linear evolution of the initial perturbation of (3). For the salinity type

initial perturbations (Ψ′ > 0), the nonlinear evolution is smaller than the linear

evolution. In general, the nonlinear term yields positive (negative) feedback for

negative (positive) Ψ′ in the case of thermally-dominated (TH) steady states.

On the other hand, when the basic steady ﬂow is a SA state ( ¯Ψ < 0), then

we have

dΨ′
dt

Similarly, we have,

= (2 ¯T − 2 ¯S − 1)T ′ + (2 ¯S − 2 ¯T + η3)S′ + Ψ′2

(11)

Ψ′(t) = Ψ′(0) +

L(T ′, S′)dτ +

Ψ′2dτ

(12)

Hence, due to nonlinear eﬀects the SA steady state becomes more unstable (sta-

ble) to disturbances Ψ′ > 0 (Ψ′ < 0) which explains the results in Fig. 8a. In

general, the nonlinear term yields positive (negative) feedback for positive (neg-

ative) Ψ′ in the case of salinity-dominated (SA) steady states.

The physical mechanism behind the loss of stability of the TH state is often

discussed in terms of the salt-advection feedback (Marotzke, 1995). A freshwa-

ter (salt) perturbation in the northern North Atlantic decreases (increases) the

northward circulation and hence decreases (increases) the northward salt trans-

port. The salt-advection feedback is independent of the sign of the perturbation

of the ﬂow rate Ψ′. In contrast, the nonlinear instability mechanism of the ther-

18

mohaline circulation depends on the sign of the perturbation of the ﬂow rate Ψ′

as discussed above.

The CNOP approach also allows us to determine the critical values of the ﬁnite

amplitude perturbations (i.e. δc) at which the nonlinearly induced transitions can

occur. The techniques are currently being generalized to be able to apply them

to models of the thermohaline circulation with more degrees of freedom. The aim

is to tackle these problems eventually in global ocean circulation models. When

applied to the latter models, the approach may provide quantitative bounds on

perturbations of the present thermohaline ﬂow such that nonlinear instability can

occur.

Appendix: The SQP method
The constrained nonlinear optimization problem considered in this paper,

after discretization and proper transformation of the objective function F , can

be written in the form

subject to

ci(x) ≤ 0,

for i = 1, 2, 3, · · · , n,

where the ci are constraint functions. It is assumed that ﬁrst derivatives of the

problem are known explicitly, i.e., at any point x, it is possible to compute the

x∈Rn F (x),
min

19

gradient ▽F (x) of F and the Jacobian J(x) = ∂(c1,c2,···,cn)

∂(x1,x2,···,xn) of the constraint

functions ci.

The SQP method is an iterative method which solves a quadratic program-

ming (QP) subproblem at each iteration and it involves outer and inner itera-

tions. The outer iterations generate a sequence of iterates (xk, λk) that converges

to (x∗, λ∗), where x∗ and λ∗ are respectively a constrained minimizer and the

corresponding Lagrange multipliers. At each iterate, a QP subproblem is used to

generate a search direction towards the next iterate (xk+1, λk+1). Solving such a

subproblem is itself an iterative procedure, which is therefore regarded as a inner

iterate of a SQP method. The following is an outline of the SQP algorithm used

Step 1. Given a starting iterate (x0, λ0) and an initial approximate Hessian

subject to

min
d

2

c(xk) + [∇c(xk)]⊤dk ≤ 0,

where dk is a direction of descent for the objective function.

Step 3. Check if (xk, λk) satisﬁes the convergence criterion, if not set xk+1 =

xk + αdk, where α ≤ 1. For λk+1, it is also determined by dk, which is automati-

cally realized in the solver (Barclay et al., 1997). Go to Step 4.

Step 4. Update the Hessian Lagrangian by using the BFGS quasi-Newton

formula (Liu and Nocedal, 1989). Let sk = xk+1 −xk, and yk = ∇L(xk+1, λk+1) −

∇L(xk, λk), where ∇L = ∇F + ∇cλ. The new Hessian Lagrangian, H k+1, can

be obtained by calculating

H k+1 = H k −

H ksksk⊤H k⊤

sk⊤H ksk +

ykyk⊤
yk⊤sk .

20

Then set k = k + 1 and go to Step 1.

In the SQP algorithm, the deﬁnition of the QP Hessian Lagrangian H k is

crucial to the success of an SQP solver.

In Gill and Saunders (1997), H k is a

limited-memory quasi-Newton approximation to G = ▽2L, the Hessian of the

modiﬁed Lagrangian. Another possibility is to deﬁne H k as a positive-deﬁnite

matrix related to a ﬁnite-diﬀerence approximation to G (Barclay et al., 1997). In

this paper, we adopt the former one, which has been shown to be eﬃcient for the

nonlinearly constraint optimization problem (Mu and Duan, 2003).

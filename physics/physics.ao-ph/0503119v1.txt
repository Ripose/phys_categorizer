Global Warming: some back-of-the-envelope
calculations

C. Fabara and B. Hoeneisen

Universidad San Francisco de Quito,
14 March 2005

Abstract

We do several simple calculations and measurements in an eﬀort to
gain understanding of global warming and the carbon cycle. Some
conclusions are interesting: (i) There has been global warming since
the end of the “little ice age” around 1700. There is no statistically
signiﬁcant evidence of acceleration of global warming since 1940. (ii)
The increase of CO2 in the atmosphere, beginning around 1940, accu-
rately tracks the burning of fossil fuels. Burning all of the remaining
economically viable reserves of oil, gas and coal over the next 150
years or so will approximately double the pre-industrial atmospheric
concentration of CO2. The corresponding increase in the average tem-
perature, due to the greenhouse eﬀect, is quite uncertain: between 1.3
and 4.8K. This increase of temperature is (partially?) oﬀset by the
increase of aerosols and deforestation. (iii) Ice core samples indicate
that the pre-historic CO2 concentration and temperature are well cor-
related. We conclude that changes in the temperatures of the oceans
are probably the cause of the changes of pre-historic atmospheric CO2
concentration. (iv) Data suggests that large volcanic explosions can
trigger transitions from glacial to interglacial climates. (v) Most of
the carbon ﬁxed by photosynthesis in the Amazon basin returns to
the atmosphere due to aerobic decay.

1 Introduction

We, two non-experts, present several “back-of-the-envelope” calculations and
some simple measurements related to global warming and the carbon cycle.
Our purpose is to understand which phenomena are important in determining
the temperature of the Earth.

2 Data

In this article we will use the following measured data.[1, 2] The power of the
radiation of the Sun per square perpendicular meter above the atmosphere
is measured to be ISun = 1368W/m2. 1 This is the “solar constant”. Since
the surface of the Earth is 4 times the surface of a disk of the same radius,
the average incident solar power per square meter of the Earth’s surface
is 1368/4 = 342W/m2. All fractions listed below refer to 342W/m2. The
fraction of sun light that is reﬂected by the Earth is measured to be 0.31
(0.21 by clouds, 0.06 by air including dust and water vapor, and 0.04 by the
ground). This is the “albedo” of the Earth. The remaining fraction (0.69) is
absorbed by the Earth (168W/m2 by the surface, 48W/m2 by the troposphere
(water vapor and aerosols), 10W/m2 by the stratosphere, and 10W/m2 by
0.69 =
clouds). So, the net solar power absorbed by the Earth is 342
236W/m2 for average cloud coverage.

·

The infrared radiation of the Earth to space measured by satellites is
235W/m2 for average cloud coverage (88W/m2 by clouds, 126W/m2 by water
vapor and CO2, and 21W/m2 by the surface through the infrared atmospheric
window). So, the incoming and outgoing energies balance to high accuracy
and determine the temperature of the biosphere.

The average temperature of the surface of the Earth is 288K= 15oC. The

−

average temperature of the atmosphere is about 250K=

In cloud free conditions the average solar power absorbed is 286W/m2,
while the average emitted terrestrial radiation is 266W/m2. The correspond-
ing numbers for average cloud cover are 236W/m2 and 235W/m2 as men-
tioned before. Note that decreasing the cloud cover has a net heating eﬀect.
The Earth radiation spectrum measured from a satellite (Figure 1) shows
that the infrared windows (λ = 8 to 9µm and 10 to 13µm) radiate as a
blackbody at the surface temperature, the CO2 absorption band (λ = 14 to
16µm) radiates at 215K (corresponding to the altitude of the tropopause at
12km), and the H2O bands (λ < 8µm and λ > 17µm) radiate at
260K
(corresponding to an altitude of 5km).

of sun light: TSun = 5780K.

3 A simple model

Let us begin with a simple model. From observations we know that, to high
accuracy, there is an equilibrium between incident solar power and radiated
infrared power. Therefore

ǫvISun = ǫIRσT 4,

where ISun = 1368W/m2 is the solar constant, ǫv is the fraction of incident
sun light power that is absorbed by the Earth, i.e.
it is the “emissivity in

is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature of the surface
of the Earth in degrees Kelvin. The factor 1

We note that if ǫv = ǫIR the equilibrium temperature is 279K, quite close

to the observed mean temperature of 288K.

These “eﬀective” emissivities are valid for the model of this Section, i.e.
an Earth surface characterized by a single temperature, and includes the
atmosphere with its greenhouse gases. The model is too crude to account for
all observations, so these eﬀective emissivities are approximate. A summary
of eﬀective emissivities is presented in Table 1.
In the last column of the
table we show the equilibrium temperature for 100% coverage of black body,
cloudless ground, clouds or snow. The last row shows the world average.

eﬀect. Adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere has two opposing eﬀects
on T : ǫ increases and T2 increases.

5 Three box model

The three box model is shown in Figure 3. The boxes are the surface of
the Earth at temperature T , the lower atmosphere at temperature T1, and
the upper atmosphere at temperature T2. The total radiation to space is
equal to the total solar radiation absorbed (235W/m2), which we assume
independent of the concentration of CO2. The solar power absorbed per unit
area is 168W/m2 by the surface, and 67W/m2 by the atmosphere. Thermals,
evaporation and transpiration are estimated to transport 102W/m2.[1] The
atmosphere absorbs radiation at frequencies near vibration resonances of the
greenhouse gases, mainly H2O, CO2 and ozone. The fraction of infrared
radiation absorbed is ǫ. The atmosphere also radiates at these frequencies.
The emissivity of the surface in the infrared is taken to be 1. The sum of
powers entering each box is zero. The greenhouse eﬀect is due to the low

5

Figure 2: Two-box model of the greenhouse eﬀect.[1]

temperature of the upper atmosphere, so that emission to space is reduced
at frequencies near resonances as shown in Figure 1.

In Table 2 we show the temperatures as a function of the emissivity of
the atmosphere in the infrared (ǫ). The absorbed sun power and power of
thermals, evaporation and transpiration are assumed to be constant (inde-
pendent of the concentration of CO2), so the model breaks down for ǫ
0.5
(with no atmosphere we should obtain T = 253.72K for 235W/m2 black-body
radiation).

It has been estimated that doubling the concentration of CO2 from (290ppm

to 580ppm) decreases the radiation to space by 3.75
temperatures are allowed to adjust) which corresponds to increasing ǫ from
0.813 to 0.833. Note, in Table 2, that doubling the concentration of CO2
raises the surface temperature T by 2.1K. Do we trust this result? No! Most
of the radiation to space is from the upper atmosphere. The temperature
of the upper atmosphere may change with CO2 concentration due to energy
ﬂuxes or absorptions not considered in this simple model. Also the solar
inputs and power of thermals, evaporation and transpiration surely depend
directly or indirectly on the CO2 concentration (by changing T and T1).

6 Global warming from Earth emission spec-

tra

Let us try a diﬀerent approach that relies only on the Earth emission spectra
shown in Figure 1. We estimate the increase in surface temperature due to
a doubling of the concentration of CO2 (from 290ppm to 580ppm). We take
the average Earth temperature to be 288K (instead of the 320K of Africa
shown in Figure 1).

≈

CO2 has two absorption bands in the tail of the solar spectrum, which
0.8W/m2. We will neglect this absorption (a correction could be
absorb
applied later). Increasing the concentration of CO2 will widen the absorption
resonance seen in Figure 1. How will the spectra respond? If the Earth
albedo remains constant, then the area below the spectra in Figure 1 will
remain constant. Then the spectra will respond by increasing (or in general,
modifying) the surface temperature, and/or the water emission temperature
(TH2O
215K). Table
2 suggests that T1 and T2 vary less than the surface temperature T . So, in
this section, without much justiﬁcation, we will assume that (i) TH2O and
TCO2 remain constant, and (ii) the Earth albedo remains constant. So, in
this approximation, the only response to the widening of the CO2 absorption

resonance is to increase the surface temperature to conserve the area under
the spectrum in Figure 1.

Let us estimate the widening of the CO2 resonance using only the data
in Figure 1. This widening in W/m2 (before any temperature has a time to
react) is called “radiative forcing”. We label points of transmittance equal
to 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.25, 0.06, 0.004 and 0.0 along the side slopes of the absorption
resonance, and then shift them downward (at constant wave number). 2 The

7 Detailed models

The results presented in this section were obtained from [1]. The surface and
troposphere are tightly coupled (by non-radiative heat exchanges), while the
coupling between the troposphere and stratosphere is relatively weak. For
this reason changes in the surface temperature are largely determined by
changes in the net (incoming minus outgoing) radiation at the tropopause
(at an altitude between 10 and 20 km). This change in net radiation at
the tropopause per unit surface area (before any temperatures are allowed to
change), ∆R, is called “radiative forcing”. The change in surface temperature
is expressed as ∆T = ∆R/λ, where λ is the “radiative damping”.
If the
Earth were a blackbody (radiating the same amount as the Earth), then
λ = 3.7Wm−2K−1. However due to various feedback eﬀects, it is estimated,
0.5Wm−2K−1.[1] So the net feedbacks
using detailed models, that λ = 2.0
are positive. 3

It is worth mentioning that various detailed models obtain ∆T in the range
from 1.3K to 4.8K for doubling of CO2[1]. The range of results is large so this
is a diﬃcult problem that does not seem to converge: as the model becomes
more complex, the uncertainties appear to increase!

≈

8 Ice ages

For given emissivities, the Earth temperature is stable because an increase in
temperature causes an increase in the infrared radiation, which in turn brings
the temperature back to its equilibrium value. However, the equilibrium
temperature depends on the emissivities. For example, a world-wide snow
storm could result in a shift of the equilibrium temperature from 288K to as
low as 252K, see Table 1, which would prevent snow from melting. In this
way an ice age might begin.

The mean annual temperature averaged over the Earth ﬂuctuates from
0.220C (during the 20’th
year to year with a standard deviation of about

50% probability we expect a ﬂuctuation of at least 4.2 standard deviations

ﬂuctuation suﬃcient to throw us into an ice age?

To get out of an ice age, an event is needed to change the emissivities,
perhaps volcanic eruptions (or meteorite impacts) that cover snow with ash.
Table 3 is a list of the largest known volcanic eruptions in the last million
years. Each one of them (except perhaps Taupo in isolated and tropical
New Zealand) corresponds (within errors) to a transition from a glacial to an
interglacial period, see Figure 4. It is interesting to note that an explosion

the volcanic origin of the transitions is correct, we should ﬁnd evidence for
other large eruptions at approximately 770, 430, 340, 270 and 140 thousand
years ago. Note however that volcanic explosions have a short-term cooling
eﬀect.[4]

9 Width of the 15µm line of CO2.

The CO2 molecule is linear, and has three normal modes of oscillation. They
have wavelengths of 15µm, 7.46µm and 4.26µm. The mode with wavelength
7.46µm has no dipole moment and does not couple to electromagnetic radia-
tion. The mode with wavelength 4.26µm barely overlaps the black-body radi-
ation spectrum of the Earth. So the important spectral line has a wavelength
λ = 15µm. We calculate the half-width of this line (neglecting molecule col-
lisions) at the points of half power to be ∆λ/λ

10−13.

Let us consider molecule collisions. The calculated mean free path at a
1µm, the rms thermal velocity of CO2 is
pressure of one atmosphere is l
≈
v = 400m/s at 300K, and the mean time between collisions is τ
2.5ns.
If the time between collisions is t, then the half-width of the spectral line
0.45λ/(ct). For t = 2.5ns the result is
between points of half power is ∆λ/λ
≈
10−5. The probability that t is in the interval dt is τ −1 exp[
∆λ/λ
dt.
So the spectral line has very long tails that absorb electromagnetic radiation.
These long tails explain the wide absorption band of CO2 seen by satellites.
We have calculated the half-width ∆λ of the window corresponding to
the λ = 15µm line of CO2 at which the power per unit area getting through
the atmosphere drops by a factor e−2:

and oceans

The chemistry of carbon in the oceans is beautifully described in [7]. We are
interested in these two equations of chemical equilibrium:

pressure of CO2 in the atmosphere (in atmospheres), and [...] are concen-
trations in sea water (in mol per liter). The equilibrium constants have

Assuming that the total carbon in the air and the top 1000m of the oceans
is constant, and that 300ppm corresponds to 100C and pH = 7.4 (8.3), we
obtain that a 100C increase in the sea water temperature produces an increase
of CO2 in the atmosphere of 40ppm (48ppm). In comparison, from Antarctic
and Greenland ice cores, it is found that 9.50C changes in temperature have
been accompanied by

75ppm change in PCO2.

In conclusion, we qualitatively understand the coupling of the pre-historic
temperature with the atmospheric concentration of CO2: an increase of ocean
temperature reduces its solubility to CO2, causing an increase of the atmo-
spheric concentration of CO2. The converse is not true: an increase of 75ppm
CO2 would increase the temperature, due to the greenhouse eﬀect, by only

11 A comment on the carbon cycle

It is observed that the concentration of CO2 has increased linearly from
325ppm in 1970 to 375ppm in 2004.[8] If this increase continues at constant
rate it will take about
140 years to reach twice the pre-industrial concen-
tration of 290ppm.

≈

It is observed that the buildup of atmospheric PCO2 accurately follows
the human emissions of CO2 (due to burning of fossil fuels and the clearing
of land for agricultural and urban use).[1] The factor of proportionality is
observed to be 65%. The remaining 35% of emitted carbon apparently ends
up in the surface (mixed) layer of the oceans and in bio-mass. No saturation
is observed so far, so the time constant with which carbon reaches the deep

oceans is in excess of 50 years (it is estimated that there are several time
constants, some as long as 2000 years).[1]

There are enough world reserves of fossil fuels (gas, oil and coal) to last
150 years at the present rate of consumption (6.5Gt C per year). Burning
≈
these reserves would increase CO2 to three times the pre-industrial concentra-
tion assuming 65% of the emitted CO2 ends up in the atmosphere. However,
on these longer time scales it is estimated that 30% (instead of 65%) of the
emitted CO2 will remain in the atmosphere.[1] Thus we estimate that burn-
ing all of the remaining reserves of fossil fuels in the next 150 years or so,
will result in twice the pre-industrial CO2 concentration.

12 Time constant to reach CO2 equilibrium

with the oceans.

The solubility of CO2 in the oceans decreases with increasing temperature.
Consider a drop in the temperature of the oceans. With what time constant
does the atmospheric concentration of CO2 drop due to the increased ab-
sorption by the oceans? Here we assume that every CO2 molecule colliding
with the ocean surface “sticks” to the surface. The number of CO2 molecules
colliding with a square meter of ocean surface per second is[9]

The number of CO2 molecules in the atmosphere per square meter is PCO2/(Mg) =
1025m−2. So the time constant for absorption of CO2 by very cold oceans is
4
·
90s (we have taken account that 0.7 of the surface of the Earth is covered
≈
by oceans). So equilibrium of CO2 and the oceans is very short if we neglect
diﬀusion of CO2 through the atmosphere.

Let us now consider diﬀusion. The partial pressure of CO2 decreases
with altitude exponentially with a characteristic height L = kT /(Mg) =
5550m. How long does it take a molecule of CO2 to diﬀuse 5550m through
the atmosphere? The result is t = L2/(vl)
2400 years. This result assumes
no convection. Convection will reduce this time considerably. In fact, the
ﬂux of carbon from the atmosphere to the oceans and vice versa is enough
to replace all the atmospheric carbon in 6 years.[1] So, on time scales of
interest, the partial pressure of CO2 in the atmosphere is proportional to
the concentration of CO2 in the surface water of the oceans: they are in
equilibrium.

13 The carbon cycle in the Amazon rain for-

est

In the process of photosynthesis, a plant takes CO2 from the air, breaks it
up using solar energy, and releases O2 back to the atmosphere. The carbon
attaches to water to form carbohydrates (CH2O)n, which is what plants are
made of. So, for every molecule of oxygen released to the atmosphere, there
remains one atom of carbon in the plant. What happens to the carbon when
the plant dies? There are three alternatives: the carbon can (i) return to the
atmosphere, (ii) accumulate on the ground, or (iii) end up in the oceans.

The photosynthesis process can occur in both directions. Examples of
photosynthesis in reverse direction are combustion when we burn wood, res-
piration, and decomposition by aerobic bacteria. In these processes the car-
bon of the plant becomes attached to oxygen from the air, and is returned to
the atmosphere as CO2. Note that no net oxygen is produced: the oxygen
released to the atmosphere during the plant growth is consumed during the
plant aerobic decay.

The carbon can end up in the soil, either as partially decomposed or-
ganic matter (humus), as hydrocarbons or as coal.
If the plant dies in a
medium that lacks oxygen, such as in oceans, lakes, rivers, swamps or under
volcanic ash, the anaerobic bacteria have a chance to decompose the plant
(without the competition from aerobic bacteria). The anaerobic bacteria
produce methane (“swamp gas”), carbonic acids, bicarbonates, and humic
acids. The methane can escape to the atmosphere, or under enough pressure
and temperature, can polymerize into hydrocarbons or can be crushed into
coal.

The carbon can be washed down the rivers, in the form of carbonic acids,
bicarbonates, and humic acids which are soluble in water. The rivers in the
Amazon basin are dark due to the humic acids.

The Amazon rain forest has humus only in the ﬁrst few centimeters of
soil. So we neglect alternative (ii). To quantify alternative (iii), we took sam-
ples of water of several tributaries of the Amazon river (Napo Alto, Napo
Bajo, San Francisco and Tiputini) and measured the concentration of bi-
carbonate (0.71 mol/m3) and carbonic acid (0.11 mol/m3). Assuming that
these concentrations are typical of the Amazon river, and multiplying by the
yearly discharge of the river, we obtain the carbon discharged to the Atlantic
ocean by the Amazon river: 50 million (metric) tonnes per year. In total,
the Amazon basin ﬁxes about 10 billion brute tonnes of carbon per year.
So, about 99.5% of this carbon returns to the atmosphere due to the aerobic
decomposition of organic matter, while only about 0.5% is washed down the

16

rivers into the Atlantic ocean.

It is interesting to compare these numbers with the world energy-related
release of carbon dioxide from the consumption of oil, gas and coal: 24 billion
tonnes in 2004. This corresponds to 6.5 billion tonnes of carbon per year.
So the Amazon basin can transfer, from the atmosphere to the oceans, one
year’s worth of carbon dioxide emission in 130 years!

14 Conclusions

With some degree of conﬁdence, we arrive at the following conclusions.

1. Ever since we have accurate measurements of the temperature of the
atmosphere, i.e. since 1702, we observe a global increase of tempera-
ture of about 0.40C per century. This warming does not accelerate in
the second half of the XX century. In fact, we see no statistically signif-
icant global warming since 1940.[2, 5] We observe no correlation of the
global temperature with the consumption of oil, coal and gas, or with
population. The atmospheric concentrations of CO2 begins to increase
around 1940[2] when oil consumption takes oﬀ, yet we observe no corre-
sponding increase of the slope of global warming.[2, 5, 10] Some studies
suggest that this is due to a balance between the heating eﬀect of CO2
and the cooling eﬀects of aerosols and deforestation.[1, 4] From the data
it is concluded that the accumulated eﬀect of humankind on the global
0.10C.[5] So,
temperature until 1990 is not statistically signiﬁcant: 0.0
the observed global warming since 1702 is part of the natural variability
of the climate as we pull out of the “little ice age” three centuries ago.

2. The pre-industrial concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere was

290
ppm in 1800. It has since increased to 375 ppm in 2004.[8] There is
convincing evidence that this increase is due to burning of fossil fuels
(and forrests, and the manufacture of cement).

≈

3. Detailed models estimate that the changes of atmospheric composition
since pre-industrial times up to 1995 produce a change of temperature
0.44K due to all greenhouse gases (about half of this is from
of 1.3
0.4K due to the change of
1.0
CO2),
albedo caused by deforestation[4]. So we do not know if human activity
heats or cools the Earth. As indicated above, no signiﬁcant net change
has been observed.

4. The increase of the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere accurately
tracks the burning of fossil fuels (and forrests). Two thirds of the

17

carbon burned ends up in the atmosphere as CO2, and the remaining
third ends up dissolved in the surface layer of the oceans (the time
constant for this dissolution is about 6 years). The fraction of excess
carbon in the atmosphere should decrease to one third in about 50
years as more carbon is incorporated into the oceans (as CO2, HCO−
3 ,
CO−−
, CaCO3), and in the land and marine biota. The last third of
3
the excess CO2 in the atmosphere is expected to return to the deep
oceans and become buried as elemental carbon and as carbonates with
several time constants ranging from hundreds to thousands of years.[1]

5. Burning all of the remaining economically viable reserves of oil, gas
and coal over the next 150 years or so will approximately double the
pre-industrial atmospheric concentration of CO2. The global warming
due to a doubling of the concentration of CO2 is expected to increase
the average surface air temperature by 1.3K to 4.8K.[1] The increase of
temperature is expected to be higher than average at higher latitudes
(and lower than average at low latitudes). The heating eﬀect of CO2 is
obvious when we look at the Earth emission spectra shown in Figure 1.
The range of results is large, so global warming is a diﬃcult problem
that does not seem to converge: as the models become more complex,
the uncertainties appear to increase!

6. Ice core samples indicate that CO2 concentration and temperature are
well correlated: a change of temperature by 9.50C corresponds to a
change in CO2 concentration from 195ppm to 270ppm.[2] Does the
change of CO2 concentration cause the change of temperature (by the
greenhouse eﬀect), or does the change of temperature cause the change
of CO2 concentration (due to the temperature dependence of the sol-
ubility of carbon in the oceans)? Due to the greenhouse eﬀect, an
increase of CO2 concentration from 195ppm to 270ppm would cause an
0.80C, much too small to account for the
increase in temperature of
observed change in temperature. Conversely, an increase of 9.50C of the
temperature of the upper 1000m of the oceans would increase the at-
mospheric concentration of CO2 by
44ppm (depending on the ocean
pH). So it is plausible that the changes of temperature of the oceans
caused the pre-historic changes of atmospheric CO2 concentration.

7. Data suggests that large volcanic explosions can trigger transitions
from glacial to interglacial climates, by covering ice with volcanic ash,
thereby changing the equilibrium temperature of the Earth as seen in
Table 1.

10 billion tonnes of carbon
per year. However, aerobic decay releases almost all of this carbon back
to the atmosphere as CO2. The balance,
50 million tonnes of carbon
per year, is discharged to the Atlantic Ocean in the form of carbonic
acids, bicarbonates, and humic acids.

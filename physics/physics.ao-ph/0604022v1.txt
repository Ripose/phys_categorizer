Abstract

The complexity of the atmosphere endows it with the property of tur-
bulence by virtue of which, wind speed variations in the atmospheric
boundary layer (ABL) exhibit highly irregular ﬂuctuations that persist
over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. Despite the large and sig-
niﬁcant body of work on microscale turbulence, understanding the statis-
tics of atmospheric wind speed variations has proved to be elusive and
challenging. Knowledge about the nature of wind speed at ABL has far
reaching impact on several ﬁelds of research such as meteorology, hy-
drology, agriculture, pollutant dispersion, and more importantly wind en-
ergy generation. In the present study, temporal wind speed records from
twenty eight stations distributed through out the state of North Dakota
(ND, USA), (∼ 70,000 square-miles) and spanning a period of nearly eight
years are analyzed. We show that these records exhibit a characteristic
broad multifractal spectrum irrespective of the geographical location and
topography. The rapid progression of air masses with distinct qualitative
characteristics originating from Polar regions, Gulf of Mexico and North-
ern Paciﬁc account for irregular changes in the local weather system in
ND. We hypothesize that one of the primary reasons for the observed
multifractal structure could be the irregular recurrence and conﬂuence of
these three air masses.

1 Introduction

Atmospheric phenomena are accompanied by variations at spatial and temporal
scales. In the present study, qualitative aspects of temporal wind speed data
recorded at an altitude of 10 ft from the earth’s surface are discussed. Such

1

recordings fall under the ABL, which is the region 1-2 km from the earths sur-
face [1]. Flows in the ABL, which are generally known to be turbulent, are
inﬂuenced by a number of factors including shearing stresses, convective insta-
bilities, surface friction and topography [1, 2]. The study of laboratory scale
turbulent velocity ﬁelds has received a lot of attention in the past (see [3] for a
summary). A. N. Kolmogorov [4, 5], (K41) proposed a similarity theory where
energy in the inertial sub-range is cascaded from the larger to smaller eddies
under the assumption of local isotropy. For the same, K41 statistics is also
termed as small-scale turbulence statistics. The seminal work of Kolmogorov
encouraged researchers to investigate scaling properties of turbulent velocity
ﬁelds using the concepts of fractals [6]. Subsequent works of Parisi and Frisch
[7], Meneveau and Srinivasan, [8, 9, 10] provided a multifractal description of
turbulent velocity ﬁelds. While there has been a precedence of scaling behavior
in turbulence at microscopic scales [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] it is not necessary that
such a scaling manifest itself at macroscopic scales, although there have been
indications of “uniﬁed scaling” models of atmospheric dynamics, [12]. Several
factors can signiﬁcantly aﬀect the behavior of a complex system such as ABL
[2, 1]. Thus, an extension of these earlier ﬁndings [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
to the present study is neither immediate, nor obvious. Attempts have also
been made to simulate the behavior of the ABL [13, 14]. However, there are
implicit assumptions made in these studies and often, there can be signiﬁcant
discrepancies between simulated ﬂows and the actual phenomenon when these
assumptions are violated [3]. On the other hand, knowledge about the nature
of wind speed at ABL has far reaching impact on several ﬁelds of research. In
particular, the need to obtain accurate statistical descriptions of ﬂows in the
ABL from actual site recordings is both urgent and important, given its utility
in the planning, design and eﬃcient operation of wind turbines, [15]. There-
fore, analysis of wind speed records based on numerical techniques is gaining
importance in the recent years. In [16], long term daily records of wind speed
and direction were represented as a two dimensional random walk and the re-
sults reinforce the important role that memory eﬀects have on the dynamics
of complex systems. In [17], the short term memory of recorded surface wind
speed records is utilized to build m’th order Markov chain models, from which
probabilistic forecasts of short time wind gusts are made. In [18], the authors
study the correlations in wind speed data sets over a span of 24 hours, using
detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA), [19] and its extension, multifractal-DFA
(MF-DFA)[20]. Their studies show that the records display long range corre-
lations with a ﬂuctuation exponent of α ∼ 1.1 along with a broad multifractal
spectrum. In addition, they also suggest the need for detailed analysis of data
sets from several other stations to ascertain whether such features are charac-
teristic of wind speed records. In [21], it is shown that rare events such as wind
gusts in wind speed data sets that are long range correlated are themselves long
range correlated. In [22], it is shown that surface layer wind speed records can
be characterized by multiplicative cascade models with diﬀerent scaling rela-
tions in the microscale inertial range and the mesoscale. Our previous studies,
[23] suggest that at short time scales, hourly average wind speed records are

2

characterized by a scaling exponent α ∼ 1.4 and at large time scales, by an ex-
ponent of α ∼ 0.7. A deeper examination of the data sets in [26] using MF-DFA
indicated that the records also admitted a broad multifractal spectrum under
the assumption of a binomial multiplicative cascade model. Interestingly, scal-
ing phenomena have also been found in ﬂuctuations of meteorological variables
that inﬂuence wind speed such as air humidity, [24], temperature records and
precipitation [25].
In [25], it is observed that while temperature records dis-
play long range correlations (α ∼ 0.7), they do not display a broad multifractal
spectrum. On the other hand, precipitation records display a very weak degree
of correlation with (α ∼ 0.5, [25]). While it is diﬃcult to directly relate the
scaling results of these variables to that of wind speed, greater insight can be
gained by analyzing data sets that are recorded over long spans from diﬀerent
meteorological stations. Motivated by these ﬁndings, we chose to investigate
the temporal aspects of wind speed records dispersed over a wide geographical
area. In the present study, we follow a systematic approach in determining the
nature of the scaling of wind speed records recorded at an altitude of 10 ft across
28 spatially separated locations spanning an area of approximately 70,000 sq.mi
and recorded over a period of nearly 8 years in the state of North Dakota.
As noted earlier, convective instabilities and topography can have a prominent
impact of the ﬂow in ABL. The air motion over North Dakota is governed by
the ﬂow of three distinct air masses with distinct qualities, namely from : (i) the
polar regions to the north (cold and dry) (ii) the Gulf of Mexico to the south
(warm and moist) and (iii) the northern paciﬁc region (mild and dry). The
rapid progression and interaction of these air masses results in the region being
subject to considerable climactic variability. These in turn can have a signiﬁcant
impact on the convective instabilities which governs the ﬂow in ABL. On the
other hand, the topography of the region has sharp contrasts on the eastern
and western parts of the state because of their approximate separation by the
boundary of continental glaciation. The eastern regions have a soft topography
compared to the western region which comprises mostly of rugged bedrock.
In the present study, we show that the qualitative characteristics of the wind
speed records do not change across the spatially separated locations despite the
contrasting topography. This leads us to hypothesize that the conﬂuence of the
air masses as opposed to the topography plays a primary role in governing the
wind dynamics over ND.

2 Methods

Spectral analysis of stationary processes is related to correlations in it by the
Wiener-Khinchin theorem, [27] and has been used for detecting possible long-
range correlations.
In the present study, we observed broad-band power-law
decay superimposed with peaks. This spectral signature was consistent across
all the 28 stations (Fig. 1(b)). Such power-law processes lack well-deﬁned
scales and have been attributed to self-organized criticality, intermittency, self-
similarity [28, 29] and multiscale randomness [30]. Superimposed on the power-

3

law spectrum, were two high frequency peaks which occur at t1 = 24 and t2 = 12
hours corresponding to diurnal and semi-diurnal cycles respectively.

Power-law decay of the power-spectrum (Fig. 1(b)) can provide cues to possi-
ble long-range correlations, but, however, it is susceptible to trends and non-
stationarities which are ubiquitous in recordings of natural phenomena. While
several estimators [31, 32] have been proposed in the past for determining the
scaling exponents from the given data, detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA),
[19] and its extension, generalized multifractal-DFA (MF-DFA)[20] have been
widely used to determine the nature of the scaling in data obtained from di-
verse settings [20, 33, 34, 35, 36]. In DFA, the scaling exponent for the given
monofractal data is determined from least-squares ﬁt to the log-log plot of the
second-order ﬂuctuation functions versus the time-scale, i.e. Fq(s) vs s where
q = 2. For MF-DFA, the variation of the ﬂuctuation function with time scale is

4

determined for varying q (q 6= 0). The superiority of DFA and MF-DFA to other
estimators along with a complete description is discussed elsewhere [33]. DFA
and MF-DFA procedures follow a diﬀerencing approach that can be useful in
eliminating local trends [19]. However, recent studies have indicated the suscep-
tibility of DFA and MF-DFA to higher order polynomial trends. Subsequently,
DFA-n [37] was proposed to eliminate polynomial trends up to order n − 1. In
the present, study we have used polynomial detrending of order four. However,
such an approach might not be suﬃcient to remove sinusoidal trends which can
be periodic [39] or quasiperiodic (see discussion in Appendix A).

Data sets spanning a number of years, as discussed here, are susceptible to sea-
sonal trends that can be periodic or quasiperiodic in nature. Such trends man-
ifest themselves as peaks in the power spectrum and their power is a fraction
of the broad-band noise. These trends can also introduce spurious crossovers
as reﬂected by log-log plot of Fq(s) vs s and prevent reliable estimation of the
scaling exponent. Such crossovers indicate spurious existence of multiple scaling
exponents at diﬀerent scales and shift towards higher time scales with increasing
order of polynomial detrending [37]. Thus, it is important to discern correlations
that are an outcome of trends from those of the power-law noise. In a recent
study, [38], a singular-value decomposition (SVD) based approach was proposed
to minimize the eﬀect of the various types of trends superimposed on long-range
correlated noise. However, SVD is a linear transform and may be susceptible
when linearity assumptions are violated. Therefore, we provide a qualitative
argument to identify multifractality in wind speed records superimposed with
periodic and/or quasiperiodic trends. Multifractality is reﬂected by a change in
the slope of the log-log ﬂuctuation plots with varying q with (q 6= 0) [20]. For
a ﬁxed q, one observes spurious crossovers in monofractals well as multifractal
data sets superimposed sinusoidal trends. Thus nonlinearity or a crossover of
the log-log plot for a ﬁxed q might be due to trends as opposed to the existence of
multiple scaling exponents at diﬀerent scales. However, we show (see discussion
under Appendix A) that the nature of log-log plot of Fq(s) vs s does not change
with varying q for monofractal data superimposed with sinusoidal trends. How-
ever, a marked change in the nature if the log-log plots Fq(s) vs s with varying
q is observed for multifractal data superimposed with trends. Therefore, in the
present study, the log-log plot of Fq(s) vs s with varying q is used as a qualita-
tive description of multifractal structure in the given data. For the wind-speed
records across the 28 stations, we found the peaks in the power spectrum to
be consistent across all the 28 stations. Thus any eﬀects due to the trend on
the multifractal structure, we believe would be consistent across the 28 stations.

3 Results

MF-DFA was applied to the data sets recorded at the 28 stations. The log-log
plots of the ﬂuctuation functions (Fq(s) vs s) with varying moments q = -10,

5

-6, -0.2, 2, 6, 10) using fourth order polynomial detrending for one of the rep-
resentative records is shown in Fig.1(c). From Fig.1(c), it can be observed that
the data sets exhibit diﬀerent scaling behavior with varying q, characteristic of
a multifractal process. This has to be contrasted with monofractal data whose
scaling behavior is indiﬀerent to the choice of q in the presence or absence of
sinusoidal trends.

To compute the q dependence of the scaling exponent h(q), we select the time
scale in the range [2.2 - 3.7] where the scaling was more or less constant for
a given q. Note that this corresponds to variations in a time span of [102.2 −
103.7] ∼ [158 − 5012] hours, for a given q.
In this range, the slope of the
ﬂuctuation curves h(q) was calculated for every q and for ever station. The
mean of the generalized exponents h(q) over all the twenty eight stations along
with the standard deviation bars are shown in Fig. 2(a).

It can be noted from Fig. 2(a) that the slopes h(q) decrease as the moment q
varies from negative to positive values which signiﬁes that wind speed ﬂuctua-
tions are heterogeneous and thus, a range of exponents is necessary to completely
describe their scaling properties. To capture this notion of multifractality, we
estimate the classical Renyi exponents τ (q) and the singularity spectrum [40]

under the assumption of binomial multiplicative process [41, 40, 20] (see Ap-
pendix A for details). The singularity spectrum of one of the representative
stations (Baker, 1N) is shown in Fig.1(d) and its variation across the 28 sta-
tions is shown in Fig. 2(b). The ﬁtting parameters a, b for the cascade model,
the Hurst exponent h(2) and the multifractal width ∆α for all the stations are
summarized in Table 1.
These results indicate multifractal scaling consistent across the stations. Earlier
studies [42, 43, 20] have suggested the choice of random shuﬄed surrogates to
rule out the possibility that the observed fractal structure is due to correla-
tions as opposed to broad probability distribution function. The wind speeds
in the present study follow a two-parameter asymmetric Weibull distribution
whose parameters were also similar across the 28 stations. MF-DFA on the
random shuﬄe surrogates of the original records Fig.2(d) indicate a scaling of
the form Fq(s) ∼ s0.5 with varying q, characteristic of random noise and loss
of multifractal structure. The width of the multifractal spectrum was used to
characterize the strength of multifractality. The histogram of the multifractal
widths obtained across the 28 stations, Fig. 2(c), was narrow with mean and
standard deviation ∆(α) = (0.4866 ± 0.0599). The multifractal widths and the
Hurst exponent h(2) across the twenty eight stations is also shown in Fig.3.

ity may be an invariant feature in describing the dynamics long-term motion
of wind speed records in ABL over North Dakota. We also believe that the
irregular recurrence and conﬂuence of the air masses from Polar, Gulf of Mexico
and the northern Paciﬁc may play an important role in explaining the observed
multifractal structure.

A Data Acquisition, MF-DFA algorithm and Dis-

cussion

A.1 Data Acquisition

The wind speed records at the 28 stations spanning nearly 8 years were obtained
from part of the climatological archives of the state of North Dakota. Stations
were selected to represent the general climate of the surrounding area. Wind
speeds were recorded by means of conventional cup type anemometers located
at a height of 10 ft. The anemometers have a range of 0 to 100 mph with an
accuracy of ±0.25 mph. Wind speeds acquired every ﬁve seconds are averaged
over a 10 minute interval to compute the 10 minute average wind speed. The
10 minute average wind speeds are further averaged over a period of one hour
to obtain the hourly average wind speed.

A.2 Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-

DFA):

MF-DFA, [20] a generalization of DFA has been shown to reliably extract more
than one scaling exponent from a time series. A brief description of the algo-
rithm is provided here for completeness. A detailed explanation can be found
elsewhere [20]. Consider a time series {xk}, k = 1 . . . N . The MF-DFA algo-
rithm consists of the following steps.

1. The series {xk} is integrated to form the integrated series {yk} given by

y(k) =

[x(i) − ¯x] k = 1, . . . N

(1)

i=k

i=1
X

where ¯x represents the average value.

2. The series {yk} is divided in to ns non-overlapping boxes of equal lengths
where ns = int(N/s). To accommodate the fact that some of the data
points may be left out, the procedure is repeated from the other end of
the data set [20].

3. The local polynomial trend yv with order v is ﬁt to the data in each box,

the corresponding variance is given by

F 2(v, s) =

{y[N − (v − ns)s + i] − yv(i)

(2)

for v = 1, . . . ns. Polynomial detrending of order m is capable of eliminat-
ing trends up to order m-1. [20]

segments.

Fq(s) =

[F 2(v, s)]q/2

In general, the index q can take any real value except zero.

5. Step 3 is repeated over various time scales s. The scaling of the ﬂuctuation
functions Fq(s) versus the time scale s is revealed by the log-log plot.

6. The scaling behavior of the ﬂuctuation functions is determined by analyz-
ing the log-log plots Fq(s) versus s for each q. If the original series {xk}
is power-law correlated, the ﬂuctuation function will vary as

Fq(s) ∼ sh(q)

(4)

The MF-DFA algorithm [20] was used to compute the multifractal ﬂuctuation
functions. The slopes of the ﬂuctuation functions (h(q)) for each
q = (−10, −6, −0.2, 2, 6, 10) was estimated by linear regression over the time
scale range s = [2.2, 3.7]. The generalized Hurst exponents (h(q)) are related
to the Renyi exponents τ (q) by qh(q) = τ (q) + 1. The multifractal spectrum
f (αh) deﬁned by, [40] αh = dτ (q)
dq , f (αh) = qαh − τ (q). Under the assump-
tion of a binomial multiplicative cascade model [40] the generalized exponents
h(q) can be determined from h(q) = 1
. The parameters a and b for
each station was determined using a nonlinear least squares ﬁt of the preceding
formula with those calculated numerically. Finally, the multifractal width was
calculated using ∆α = ∆αh = h(−∞) − h(∞) = (ln(b)−ln(a))

q − ln(aq+bq)

, [20].

A.3 Discussion

The power spectrum of the wind speed records considered in the present study
exhibited a power law decay of the form (S(f ) ∼ 1/f β) superimposed with
prominent peaks which corresponds to multiple sinusoidal trends. Such a be-
havior is to expected on data sets spanning several years. The nature of the
power spectral signature was consistent across all stations. This enables us to
compare the nature of scaling across the 28 stations. Recent studies had indi-
cated the susceptibility of MF-DFA to sinusoidal trends in the given data, [39].
Sinusoidal trends can give rise to spurious crossovers and nonlinearity in the
log-log plot that indicate the existence of more than one scaling exponent. In
a recent study [38], we had successfully used the singular-value decomposition
to minimize the eﬀect of oﬀset, power-law, periodic and quasi-periodic trends.
However, SVD is a linear transform and may be susceptible when linearity as-
sumptions are violated. Estimating the SVD for large-embedding matrices is
computationally challenging. Therefore, in the present study we opted for a

14

qualitative description of multifractal structure by inspecting the nature of the
log-log plots of the ﬂuctuation function versus time scale Fq(s) vs s with varying
moments q. We show that the nature of the log-log plot does not show appre-
ciable change with varying moments q for monofractal data superimposed with
sinusoidal trends. However, a marked change in the nature of the log-log plot
is observed for multifractal data superimposed with sinusoidal trends. More-
over, the nature of the trends as reﬂected by the power spectrum is consistent
across the 28 stations. This enables us to compare the multifractal description
obtained across the stations. The eﬀectiveness of the qualitative description is
demonstrated with synthetic monofractal and multifractal data sets superim-
posed with sinusoidal trends.

A.3.1 MF-DFA results of monofractal and multifractal data super-

imposed with sinusoidal trends

Consider a signal y1(n) consisting of monofractal data s1(n) superimposed with
a sinusoidal trend t1(n). Let y2(n) be a signal consisting of multifractal data
s2(n) superimposed with sinusoidal trend t2(n). The trends are described by,

t1(n) = A1 sin(2πn/T1) + A2 sin(2πn/T2) + A3 sin(2πn/T3), n = 1 . . . N1
t2(n) = B1 sin(2πn/T1b) + B2 sin(2πn/T2b), n = 1 . . . N2

The signals are given by, yi(n) = si(n)+ti(n), i = 1, 2 where s1(n) is monofractal
data with α = 0.9 and s2(n) is multifractal data is that of internet log traﬃc,
[44]. The dominant spectral peaks Fig.4(a) and Fig.4(b) reﬂect the presence
of these trends in signals y1 and y2 respectively. The MF-DFA plots Fq(s)
vs
s with fourth order detrending and q = −10, −8, −6, −4, −2, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
for signals y1 and y2 are shown in Fig.4(c) and Fig.4(d) respectively. For the
monofractal data, the trends introduce spurious crossover at s ∼ 2.2 in the log-
log plot of the Fq(s) vs s for a given q. However, the nature of the log-log plots
fail to show appreciable change with varying q, Fig.4(c). For multifractal data
with trends, spurious crossovers are still noted at s ∼ 2.2 in the log-log plot of
the Fq(s) vs s for a given q. However, in this case, Fig.4(d), the nature of the
log-log plots show a signiﬁcant change with varying q indicating multifractal
scaling in the given data, unlike the case with monofractal data with trends.

Abstract

A portion of 20 minutes of the GPS signals collected during the Bridge 2 experimental
campaign, performed by ESA, have been processed.

An innovative algorithm called Parfait , developed by Starlab and implemented within
Starlab’s GNSS-R Software package STARLIGHT (STARLab Interferometric Gnss Toolkit),
has been successfully used with this set of data.

A comparison with tide values independently collected and with diﬀerential GPS processed
data has been performed. We report a successful PARIS phase altimetric measure of the
Zeeland Brug over the sea surface with a rapidly changing tide, with a precision better than
2 cm.

1. The GPS reﬂected ﬁeld retrieved by GPS processing

1.1.

Introduction

As reported in [22], during the last decade many experimental campaigns to recover GPS
reﬂected data have been successfully organised (a partial list in Table (1.1.)).

The data which have been used in the work described in this paper were collected during

• Analysis of the direct and reﬂected signals and EM ﬁeld extraction.

the Bridge-2 experiment [20].

This article covers the following issue:

• Analysis of the reﬂected ﬁeld behaviour.

• PARIS phase altimetry.

• Analysis of the altimetric results.

1.2. Phase retrieval

The importance of retrieving the phase of the EM ﬁeld backscattered by the sea surface,
in an Earth observation application, is related to the possibility of accurately estimate the
delay of the reﬂected signal w.r.t the direct one, i.e. for altimetric purposes as well as ([23])
is related to the sea surface conditions.
Clearly, in order to collect the phase of the EM ﬁeld, the complex signal has to be considered.
In the current experiment, only the in-phase component of the signal is sampled and stored.
It is necessary than to generate locally a quadrature component. This is done as presented
in Figure (1). Let us represent the signal received at the antenna input ∗ as

s(t) = C(t)D(t)cos((ωL1 + ωd)t)

(1)

where C(t) represent the C/A code, D(t) the navigation code, ωL1 the L1 carrier frequency,
and ωd the actual Doppler frequency. After modulation with a local oscillator of frequency
ωL1 −ωIF and low-pass ﬁltering, the signal will have a residual carrier at ωd +ωIF . This signal
is then mixed with to phasors at frequency ωIF + ˜ωd, where ˜ωd is the available estimation of
the Doppler frequency for the satellite under investigation. These two phasors are relatively
delayed by π/2 radians, i.e. they are in quadrature. The result of such a mixing is a signal
with two frequency component: ∆ωd, the error in the Doppler frequency estimation, and
2(ωIF + ωd) − ∆ωd, a spurious frequency which is not possible to ﬁlter out and that is
considered as a noise component.

With the assumption that the navigation bit Dk is constant during the integration time
(always true if Ti = 1 ms, in the other cases it is true if the code is aligned with the navigation
bit and the coherent integration time is a sub-multiple of 20 ms) and that the component
of the signal at higher frequency does not correlate with the clean replica of the C/A code
(thanks to the PRN code properties), the i-th sample of the correlation between the in-phase
component of the signal and the clear replic can be written as

and for the in-quadrature component:

Ii =

∗This represent only the C/A code part. The P code part can be neglected thanks to the subsequent
correlation of the signal with replicas of the C/A code. The two code are in fact orthogonal.

This equation is true if ∆ωdi+1 ≈ ∆ωdi, which is a good approximation since the time dur-
ing which this variation is measured is the coherent time of integration, i.e. in the order of
milliseconds.

The main advantage of using this delta-phase approach to phase tracking is that we have
to deal with diﬀerential value, that is smaller values than the full phase values. This allows
an easy detection of the π radiants change of phase due to the presence of the navigation bit.

Figures from 2 to (7), used to explain these concepts, refers to the processing of another
set of GPSR data (the Casablanca Experiment). In Figure (2) the histogram of the delta-
phases is shown. The x-axis represent cycles and the y-axis just arbitrary units. The most
part of δ-phase values is clearly concentrated around zero. Another considerable amount of
values is allocated just before ±π. These values represent in fact small values to which ±π
radiants have been added, for the occurrence of a navigation bit.

In Figure (3) both the phase with and without the navigation bit eﬀects are plotted. In
order to derive geophysical parameters from GNSS-R, the phase has to be considered without
any Doppler contribution. In Figure (4) this phase for the direct and the reﬂected signal are
shown. The eﬀect of the reﬂection on the sea surface is clearly visible in the huge variations
present in Figure (4(b)) with respect to Figure (4(a)). In Figure (5) and (6) the amplitude
magnitude and respectively the complex vector of the direct and reﬂected ﬁelds are shown.
In Figure (7) a simulation of the L1 GPS ﬁeld after reﬂection is shown. The parameter of
the simulation are chosen according to the Casablanca experiment characteristics.

2. A parfait approach

2.1.

Introduction

It is know that the major inconvenient while tracking the reﬂected ﬁeld phase is the occur-
rence of fadings. Even though in the Bridge 2 experiment, due to the relative smoothness of
the sea surface [20], these problematic events are not so frequent, nonetheless, since a single
event can completely destroy the phase information, some countermeasures must be taken.
For example (see [20]), it is possible to inject in the system (during the fading events) a
model-based phase. Another possibility is not to track the reﬂected ﬁeld phase at all but to
track the direct ﬁeld minus the reﬂected ﬁeld phase, which is really what PARIS concept is
about.

Let us see more in detail why we should not try to track the phase at all. First, a
distinction should be made. Using the accumulated phase for altimetry presupposes two
diﬃcult tasks:

• Tracking the phase (hard due to bandwidth and fadings).

• (If tracking is possible) use the tracked phase for altimetry.

Note that the second point is often overlooked. Yet we know that the accumulated phase
acts like a random walk. The average accumulated phase is very badly behaved (essentially
meaningless).

Tracking the phase is important if the signal of interest rotates fast as compared to noise-
induced rotation. This is deﬁnitely not the case in the bridge phase or in any other coastal
application of the technique. In fact, it is never true for PARIS applications over the oceans.
It is also very diﬃcult to do: errors accumulate fast, as above mentioned for example, during
fading events.

Even more important, the accumulated phase is meaningless. As we have shown in previ-
ous work, the phase wanders around, jumping to diﬀerent winding number kingdoms. This
would appear to be a disaster, but it is not: what we would like to get, if the geophysical
signals of interest move slowly enough, is the average ﬁeld. This exists even if the phase
wanders and wanders.

In the bridge experiment the sea state was very smooth.
phase may still be useful but in general, this is deﬁnitely not true.

In such a case, tracking the

2.2. Using the direct minus reﬂected combination

What we are after is the diﬀerence of direct and reﬂected signals. Note that the same ωE
will be used for direct and reﬂected—this simpliﬁes things. We can then return to equation
(5), and write

TE.

(6)

Note that we are measuring directly the interferometric ﬁeld. Let us now address some of
important points.

2.3. Why we don’t need to worry about emission versus reception

time diﬀerences

The diﬀerence between direct and reﬂected paths is much less than a microsecond (300 light-
meters). Even for a fast moving GPS satellite, this is essentially zero.

This is the essential measurement we are making on reception of a GPS signal:

c∆t = ||xR(tR) − xE(tE)|| ≈ ||xR(tR) − xE(tR) − VEδt||,

(7)

where δt is the time it take from emission to reception. This is of the order 2x107 light
meters (about 0.07 seconds). Deﬁnitely signiﬁcant: the emitter will move about 300 me-
ters in this time. What does it mean? Well, since we will work with the direct minus
reﬂected travel times, the eﬀect is null. Recall that from a ground platform we essentially
have ∆DR ≈ 2h sin α, where α is the elevation. In 0.07 seconds, the change of elevation is
negligible.

On the base of these considerations, a new approach to PARIS altimetry is described in
the following sections. It is called PARis Filtered-ﬁeld AltImetric Tracking technique (PAR-
FAIT technique) and it proved to be a very robust and precise processing method.

3. The parfait processing

In this section the basis of the parfait processing are presented. The parfait pro-
cessing is an innovative processing for GNSS-R data developed by Starlab, as part of the
STARLIGHT GNSS-R software package. In the frame of this CCN, the application of such
a processing will lead to the estimation of the height of the antennas of the Bridge 2 Experi-
ment over the sea surface.

Simple geometrical considerations lead to the following equation which relates the height
of the receiver over the reﬂecting surface (considering the same height for the upward looking
antenna and for the downward looking antenna) with the delay measured between the direct
and reﬂected GPS signals:

delayP RN (t) · c = 2 h (t) sin (ǫP RN (t)) + dof f set

(8)

where delayP RN (t) is the measured delay between the two signals at time t, h(t) is the height
of the bridge at time t, ǫP RN (t) is the elevation at time t of the GPS satellite with a speciﬁc
PRN number, and dof f set is the hardware-induced delay, considered to be constant in time
(c is the light speed). From this equation it is evident that a ﬁrst estimation of the height
of the receiver can be easily done with a linear ﬁt of the measured delay with respect to the
sinus of the elevation angles of each satellite. The delay between direct and reﬂected signal,
though, can be measured through two quantities: C/A code and carrier phase. In the case
of carrier phase, equation (8) must be rewritten as follows

delayP RN (t) = 2 h (t) sin (ǫP RN (t)) + NP RN λ + dof f set

(9)

where this time delayP RN (t) is already in meters and λ is the carrier wavelength. In other
words, the equation of each satellite contains an unknown parameter NP RN . In order to use
all the satellites for one height estimation, it is then necessary to estimate also NP RN , i.e. to
solve the ambiguity problem. In practise, the following procedure was used. All the measured
delayP RN (t) have been put in an unique vector, with an additional additive parameter bP RN

(delay1(t1), delay1(t2), ..., (delay2(t1) + b2), ...

(delay2(t2) + b2), ..., (delayp(tm) + bp)).

The corresponding vector for the sine of the elevation angles was then built. Using these
two vectors, a linear ﬁt has been performed, resulting in a certain value for the norm of the
residuals of the ﬁt. Finally, considering this norm as a function of the parameters bP RN , the
optimum value ˆbP RN that minimises the norm has been found. For this bP RN one obtains
the best interpolation, i.e. the best value for a ﬁrst estimation of the height of the bridge.
This estimation of the height is nonetheless quite rough. Let us see why and how to improve
this estimation. First of all, remember that the term on left-hand side of equation (9) can be
written as (see also equation (6))

delayP RN (t) = λdφR−D

i

(10)

i

where dφR−D
is the phase of the (reﬂected minus direct) interferometric ﬁeld. This ﬁeld
is generally corrupted by fadings and, during fadings, the phase of this interpherometric
signal is completely impossible to track (basically, during these events, the reﬂected signal
is not present at all). Moreover, the optimisation previously described is performed in the
R domain, without correctly approaching the ambiguity problem which is inherently to be
solved in the integer domain.
To face the fading problem, we propose to ﬁlter the interferometric ﬁeld. This ﬁltering should
be long enough to eliminate fading problems and short enough to let the signal of interest
pass through. Consider the usual equation

λdφR−D
i

(t) = 2 h (t) sin (ǫP RN (t)) + dof f set.

(11)

i

The value of dφR−D
should not change for more than a fraction of 2π in the time duration of
the ﬁlter. This maximal time depends clearly on the elevation angle of the satellite and, just
slightly, form the tide motion. In the case under examination the maximum ﬁltering time is
around 10 seconds. In other words, in 10 seconds, at least for one satellite, dφR−D
changes of
π
2 radiants. With this ﬁlter length, the fadings are not completely eliminated, even though a
realistic estimation of the bridge height (and dof f set) is now possible. To deﬁnitely override
the fading problems, a longer integration should be performed, without killing the signal

i

(12)

(14)

(15)

(16)

(dφR−D
) we wish to measure. To this end, it is possible to counter-rotate the interferometric
i
ﬁeld, using the ﬁrst guess of the bridge height as explained in the following. Consider the
interferometric ﬁeld as

Einterf ∝ exp{dφR−D

i

} = exp{2 h (t) ...

sin (ǫP RN (t)) + dof f set}
(13)
and assume a ﬁrst guess ˆhb for the bridge height (and ˆdof f set for the oﬀset). Than the
interferometric ﬁeld is down-converted or counter-rotated using the bridge height initial guess

Ecrot

interf ∝ exp{2 hb (t) sin (ǫP RN (t)) + ...

dof f set} · exp −2 ˆhb (t) sin (ǫP RN (t)) + ˆdof f set

obtaining

Ecrot

interf ∝ exp{2 δhb (t) sin (ǫP RN (t)) + δdof f set}.

Clearly, the phase of the ﬁeld in equation (16) varies much slower than the phase of the orig-
inal interferometric ﬁeld and this allows a longer ﬁltering time, that is, virtually, a complete
elimination of fadings problems.
This technique provides a fundamental cornerstone for PARIS processing from air and space-
borne applications.

The equation which relates the phase delay between direct and reﬂected signal, the satellite
elevations and the δhb (i.e. the error between the ﬁrst guess of the bridge height and the real
value) turns out to be

λdφR−D
i

(t) = 2 δhb (t) sin (ǫP RN (t)) + NP RN λ + δdof f set

(17)

This is the new equation to be used to ﬁt the straight line and infer the height of the bridge,
with respect to the ﬁrst guess used to counter-rotate the ﬁeld. As already said, the equation
relating the interferometric phase and the bridge height is known up to a multiple of wave-
length (equation (9)) or, in other words, there is an ambiguity due to the periodic behaviour
of the phase. In order to correctly solve this ambiguity problem, a search is performed in the
space of the n-uples of integers and the one that produce the linear ﬁt with smallest residue
is assumed as the true one. It is important to point out that the space of the n-uples to be
spanned in order to remove the ambiguity is drastically reduced by the ﬁltering of the ﬁeld
previously described. In fact, since the only residual movement in the ﬁltered data is the
tide, the single ﬁltered phase history, will all lie in a narrow height interval. This interval is
determined basically by the correctness of ﬁrst guess for the bridge height. In other words,
if the guess is within ± half meter, the n-uples subspace to be scan can be limited to those
n-uples whose components belong to the interval [−3, 3], centred on the ﬁrst guess of the
n-uple, obtained from the real solution.
Another possibility to reduce the cardinality of the subspace of the n-uples to check, is to
consider that satellites with similar elevation angles cannot have very diﬀerent integer ambi-
guities.

4. First altimetric results

The parfait analysis described in the previous section, has been applied to the ﬁrst 10
minutes of the Bridge2 data, part A1 and to the ﬁrst 10 minutes of the part A2. The following
step have been performed accordingly:

• the EM ﬁelds, direct and reﬂected, have been computed through the GPS correlation

process;

• the ﬁeld has been counter-rotated (equation (16));

• the ﬁeld has been ﬁltered;

• the phase of the ﬁeld has been evaluated;

• a straight line has been interpolated to the phase histories (one for each visible satellite)

against the elevation angle (equation (17));

• the real n-uple of values of λNP RN that minimise the residue of the ﬁt is use to deﬁne

a ﬁrst guess for the integer n-uple of values of NP RN ;

• the linear ﬁt has been again performed for every integer n-uple of NP RN to ﬁnd the

one that minimises the residuals.

The ﬁlter used for smoothing the ﬁeld is a ﬂat zero-phase ﬁlter, with a length of 30

seconds.
This ﬁltering has been performed for almost† all visible satellites (see table (2) and Figure
(9)). The phase histories are shown in Figure (10(a)). A straight line has been ﬁt through
these phase histories, against the sinus of the satellite elevation angle (ﬁgure (10(b))).

This ﬁtted line gives an estimation of the bridge height of 18.61 m, an hardware bias of
-0.81 and, as ﬁrst guess for the n-uple that solves the ambiguity problem, the values [001123].
Now, a search in a subset of I6 is done to minimise the residuals of the ﬁt in the space of
the n-uples of integers. The subspace considered is the one spanned by all the combination
of integers between ±3 around the ﬁrst guess. The result is the n-uple [0 0 2 2 4 5] which gives
a bridge height estimation of 18.82 m and an instrumental bias of −0.45.

This procedure has been applied to the ﬁrst 10 minutes of the part A1 and of part A2
of the data. The results are reported in Table (2) and in Figure (11) for part A1 and in
Table (2) and in Figure (13) for part A2. The ﬁnal value of the estimated bridge height is
considered to be the interpolated straight line through the available point after removing the
supposed estimation bias . The use of a straight line for the interpolation is justiﬁed by the
short period of time considered, relatively to the tide period. The standard deviation of the
interpolated estimation w.r.t. the measured tide is of 0.35 cm for part A1 and of 0.84 cm for
part A2. The results for both periods are plotted in ﬁgure (2).

Fitting both parts to the tide curve, i.e. choosing the bias that minimises the standard
deviation of the data to tide “ground truth”, leads to a bias of 41.10 cm and a standard
deviation of 1.81 cm. This bias could be due either to an error in the determination of the
absolute value of the height of the bridge performed with the diﬀerential GPS processing or,
partially, to some anomalies in the ﬂowing of the water in the vicinity of the bridge structures.

Moreover, assuming also that the tide measured below the bridge can have a time delay
with respect to the place were the tide is measured, the best ﬁt (over both bias and delay)

†Satellites outside the Zeeland Mask , as deﬁned in [19] are discharged (see also caption of Figure (9).

is obtained with a delay of 3 minutes and 12 seconds with respect to the time of the tide
data collection and with a bias of 39.13 cm. The standard deviation of the ﬁtted data with
respect to the tide curve is in this case of 0.893 cm.

Another interesting check to be done to asses the validity of the processing is to compare
the change in the height of the bridge between the ﬁrst 10 minutes of part A1 and the ﬁrst 10
minutes of part A2 as retrieved by the processing and as provided by the tide measurements.
This comparison is shown in ﬁgure (2). The result is absolutely satisfying: the estimation is
in accordance with the measures within about 4 cm.

To summarise, the proposed approach to PARIS altimetry, the parfait technique, leads

to possibly biased but very precise estimation of the tide,

Figure 1: Starting from the in-phase component of the sampled signal, with a carrier frequency equal to the
sum of the IF of the receiver and the Doppler frequency, two downconvertions are performed, with two phasor
relatively delayed of π/2. After a low-pass ﬁltering, the two obtained signals bring information about the
amplitude of the backscattered EM ﬁeld for both the in-phase and in-quadrature components.

Figure 3: The carrier phase obtained accumulating the δ-phase according to equation (5). The stepped
plot represent this accumulated phase as it is , i.e. without compensating for the navigation bit half-cycle
variation. The lower curve represent the same phase after removal of this eﬀect. The unit of the x-axis is
milliseconds, on the y-axis is cycles.

Figure 9: Each coloured arc represents the position of a GPS satellite from the start of the part A1 of the
experiment to the beginning of part A2 plus 10 minutes. The PRN number is closed to the beginning of
the data. The green mask represent the area where the GPS signal reﬂections are supposed to be free of
shadowing phenomena due to the bridge structure, and therefore only the satellite within this mask can be
taken into consideration for PARIS processing. The bold parts of the lines represent the ﬁrst and the second
10 minutes periods.

Figure 12: This line represents the diﬀerence of two diﬀerences: the diﬀerence of the measured bridge heights
during the collection of the ﬁrst part of data and those measured during the second part minus the same
diﬀerence but calculated with the estimated data. The result conﬁrms again the eﬀectiveness of the parfait
processing.

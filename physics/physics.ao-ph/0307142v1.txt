Abstract. In this paper we extend earlier results regarding the eﬀects of the lower layer
of the ocean (below the thermocline) on the baroclinic instability within the upper layer
(above the thermocline). We confront quasigeostrophic baroclinic instability properties
of a 2.5-layer model with those of a 3-layer model with a very thick deep layer, which
has been shown to predict spectral instability for basic state parameters for which the
2.5-layer model predicts nonlinear stability. We compute and compare maximum normal-
mode perturbation growth rates, as well as rigorous upper bounds on the nonlinear growth
of perturbations to unstable basic states, paying particular attention to the region of
basic state parameters where the stability properties of the 2.5- and 3-layer model diﬀer
substantially. We found that normal-mode perturbation growth rates in the 3-layer model
tend to maximize in this region. We also found that the size of state space available for
eddy-amplitude growth tends to minimize in this same region. Moreover, we found that
for a large spread of parameter values in this region the latter size reduces to only a small
fraction of the total enstrophy of the system, thereby allowing us to make assessments of
the signiﬁcance of the instabilities.

1. Introduction

Observations indicate that most of the world oceans variability is conﬁned
in a thin layer limited from below by the permanent thermocline. There,

the density is approximately uniform in the vertical but has important
horizontal gradients. The latter imply the existence of a considerable reser-
voir of potential energy within this layer, stored in the isopycnals tilt and
available to feeding baroclinic instability processes (Gill et al., 1974). Haine
and Marshall (1998) have argued that these processes are of outmost im-
portance for the dynamics of the upper ocean. These authors pointed out
that baroclinic instability waves can be eﬃcient transport agents capable
of stopping convective processes, thereby exerting a large inﬂuence in the
thermodynamic state of the ocean.

Because the total depth of the ocean is much larger than that of the
upper thermocline layer, the reduced-gravity setting has been commonly
adopted to studying the upper ocean baroclinic instability (Fukamachi et al., 1995;
Ripa, 1995; Young and Chen, 1995; Beron-Vera and Ripa, 1997; Ripa, 1999b;
Olascoaga and Ripa, 1999; Ripa, 1999c; Ripa, 1999a; Ripa, 2000a; Ripa, 2000b;
Ripa, 2001). In this setting the active ﬂuid layer is considered as ﬂoating on
top of a quiescent, inﬁnitely deep layer. Olascoaga (2001) showed, however,
that a thick—but ﬁnite—abyssal active layer can substantially alter the sta-
bility properties of the upper ocean for certain baroclinic zonal ﬂows, such
as the Atlantic North Equatorial Current (ANEC) (Beron-Vera and Olascoaga, 2003).
Olascoaga (2001) considered spectral (i.e. linear, normal-mode), formal (or
Arnold), and nonlinear (or Lyapunov) stability (Holm et al., 1985; cf. also
McIntyre and Shepherd, 1987) in a 3-layer quasigeostrophic (QG) model.
Primary attention was given to the limit of a very thick bottom layer.
The stability results were compared with those from a reduced-gravity
2-layer (or 2.5-layer) model (Olascoaga and Ripa, 1999), and assessments
were made of the inﬂuence of the deep ocean on upper ocean baroclinic
instability.

To make further assessments, in this paper we turn our attention to
baroclinic instability saturation. Employing Shepherd’s (1988) method, we
establish and confront rigorous bounds on nonlinear instability saturation
in 2.5- and 3-layer models. This method, which builds on the existence of a
nonlinear stability theorem, has been previously used to compute saturation
bounds in 2.5- (Olascoaga and Ripa, 1999) and 3-layer (Paret and Vanneste, 1996)
models. In addition to considering more general model conﬁgurations than
in these earlier works, we focus on the size of state space available for
the growth of eddies in the region of parameter space where the mod-
els present discrepancies in their stability properties. Also, unlike Paret
and Vanneste (1996), who computed numerical energy-norm bounds based
on both Arnold’s ﬁrst and second theorems, we derive analytical expres-
sions for enstrophy-norm bounds based on Arnold’s ﬁrst theorem. Maxi-
mum normal-mode perturbation growth rates in the 3-layer model are also
calculated and contrasted with those in the 2.5-layer model.

DEEP OCEAN INFLUENCE ON BAROCLINIC INSTABILITY 3

The reminder of the paper has the following organization. Section 2
presents the 3-layer model, from which the 2.5-layer model follows as a
limiting case. Normal-mode perturbation growth rates are computed in
§ 3, along with an exposition of the main results of formal and nonlinear
stability analyses. Nonlinear saturation bounds are then derived in § 4. We
want to remark that the number of basic state parameters that deﬁne a 3-
layer ﬂow is too large to be explored in full detail. To facilitate the analysis
we reduce in some cases this number by ﬁxing certain parameters to values
that can be taken as “realistic,” because of being found appropriate for
a region of the ocean mainly dominated by the ANEC, which is a good
example of a major zonal current. Section 5 presents a discussion and the
conclusions. Appendices A and B are reserved for mathematical details
relating to the computation of the saturation bounds in the 3- and 2.5-layer
models, respectively.

2. The Layer Models

Let x denote the horizontal position with Cartesian coordinates x (east-
ward) and y (northward), let t be the time, and let D be an inﬁnite (or
periodic) zonal channel domain on the β plane with coasts at y = ± 1

unforced, inviscid evolution equations for QG motions in a 3-layer model,
with rigid surface and ﬂat bottom, are given by (cf. e.g. Ripa, 1992)

In this paper we deal with the stability of a basic state, i.e. equilibrium

which represents a baroclinic zonal ﬂow. Here, Ui =

whereas U3 is an arbitrary constant (set here to zero with no loss of general-
ity). The following six parameters are enough to characterize the solutions
of the 3-layer model stability problem:

the ratio of the planetary β eﬀect and the topographic β eﬀect due to the
geostrophic slope of the upper interface. Here, Us := U1 − U2 is the velocity

eter, bT, is a topographic Charney number given by the ratio of the
topographic β eﬀects due to the geostrophic slopes of the lower and upper
interfaces. Finally, the ﬁfth (resp., sixth), r1 (resp., r2), parameter is the
aspect ratio of the upper to intermediate (resp., upper-plus-intermediate
to lower) reference layer thicknesses. The problem considered by Olascoaga
(2001) had r1 = 1. In turn, the 2.5-layer problem treated by Olascoaga and
Ripa (1999), which can be recovered upon making r2 → 0 and ψ3 → 0, also
had r1 = 1.

determined from the inspection of the elements of Hα (cf. Mu et al., 1994;
Paret and Vanneste, 1996; Ripa, 2000a).

In ﬁgure 1 the regions of the (b, bT)-space labeled “Stable” correspond
to basic states for which there exists α such that Hα is positive deﬁnite
(Arnold’s ﬁrst theorem). The regions labeled “Possibly Stable” are locus
of basic states for which there exists α such that Hα is negative deﬁnite
(Arnold’s second theorem) if the channel in which the ﬂow is contained is
suﬃciently narrow; cf. Mu (1998) and Mu and Wu (2001) for details on
optimality issues relating to Arnold’s second theorem. The results, which
are independent of the choice of s, are presented for r1 = 0.5, a value
estimated for the ANEC. The r.h.s. panel in this ﬁgure corresponds to the 3-
layer model in the limit r2 → 0; the l.h.s. panel corresponds to the 2.5-layer
model. Clearly, as r2 → 0 the 3-layer model stable region does not reduce to
that of the 2.5-layer model; it also requires δψ3 → 0 (Olascoaga, 2001). In

energy–momentum integrals. In the blank regions a pseudo energy–momentum integral

deﬁnite.

the regions labeled “ERI” no sign-deﬁnite Hα can be found. Consequently,
the corresponding states are always unstable either through normal-mode
perturbations or explosive resonant interaction (ERI) (Vanneste, 1995). By
contrast, in the 2.5-layer instability problem all basic states subject to ERI
are spectrally unstable. Finally, nonlinear stability can be proven for all
formally stable states. Namely, the departure from these basic states can
be bounded at all times by a multiple of the initial distance.

For spectral stability a perturbation is assumed to be inﬁnitesimal
and with the structure of a normal mode, i.e. ˆq = ε˜qe−ikct + O(ε2), where
ε → 0. Nontrivial solutions for ˜q, which satisﬁes Hc˜q = 0, require condition
det Hc = 0 to be fulﬁlled. This implies the eigenvalue c(κ; s, b, bT, r1, r2)
to satisfy P (c) = 0, where P (·) is a cubic characteristic polynomial (cf.
Beron-Vera and Olascoaga, 2003, appendix B).

Figure 2 shows the 3-layer model maximum perturbation growth rate,
maxκ{κ Im c}, for r1 = 0.5, and diﬀerent values of parameters r2 and s
in the planetary b vs. topographic bT Charney numbers space. In general,
the maximum perturbation growth rate increases with increasing r2 and
decreasing s. As bT increases, the maximum perturbation growth rate tends
to achieve the largest values in the region where the 2.5-layer model is
nonlinearly stable as a consequence of Arnold’s ﬁrst theorem, even for
(realistically) small values of r2 as depicted in the bottom panels of the
ﬁgure.

as in ﬁgure 2. The area of the region of possible wavenumbers for destabi-
lizing perturbations in the 3-layer model increases with increasing r2 and
decreases with decreasing s. Thus the likelihood of these instabilities, which
are not present in the 2.5-layer model, appear to be quite limited because
they are conﬁned only to small bands of wavenumbers for small s and r2.
Yet the perturbation growth rates in these bands are not negligible even
for very small values of r2 according to Olascoaga (2001), who explained
these instabilities as a result of the resonant interaction between a neutral
mode of the 2.5-layer model instability problem and a short Rossby wave
in the bottom layer of the 3-layer model. In the next section we will see,
however, how the existence of nonlinearly stable states contributes to arrest
the eddy-amplitude growth, restricting the signiﬁcance of these instabilities,
at least for certain basic state parameters.

Let us ﬁnally turn our attention to the region of (b, bT)-space where
the two models allow for the possibility of instability. The 2.5-layer model
acquires its maximum perturbation growth rates for b = 1

to an exact cancellation of the planetary and topographic β eﬀects, i.e.

for the 3-layer model because of the presence of instabilities not present in

the 2.5-layer problem. The latter instabilities are conﬁned to very narrow
branches in the (κ, bT)-space and were also explained by Olascoaga (2001)
as a result of the resonant interplay of a neutral mode in the 2.5-layer
model instability problem and a short Rossby wave in the bottom layer of
the 3-layer model. The maximum perturbation growth rates associated with
these instabilities are larger than those of the 2.5-layer model (Olascoaga,
2001). In the following section we will see, however, that the fraction of the
total enstrophy of the system available for eddy-amplitude growth can be
much smaller in the 3-layer model than in the 2.5-layer model for certain
unstable basic states.

4. Upper Bounds on Instability Saturation

When a basic state is unstable, a priori upper bounds on the ﬁnite-amplitude
growth of the perturbation to this state can be obtained using Shepherd’s
(1988) method. This method relies upon the existence of a nonlinear stabil-
ity theorem, and the bounds are given in terms of the “distance” between
the unstable basic state, QU

in the inﬁnite-dimensional phase space.

various values of the topographic Charney number bT. The focus on the
small value r2 = 0.1 will allow us to make comparisons with the stability
properties of the 2.5-layer model. The latter model’s bound (cf. appendix B)
is also plotted in the ﬁgure (dashed lines) assuming r1 = 0.5 and the same
values of bT. It is important to remark that the 2.5-layer bound does not
follow from that of the 3-layer model in the limit r2 → 0; it also requires
ψ3 = 0 (Olascoaga, 2001). Both the 2.5- and 3-layer model bounds are
independent of the stratiﬁcation parameter s. The 2.5-layer model bound
curves are only present in the upper three panels of the ﬁgure because the
2.5-layer model predicts nonlinear stability as a consequence of Arnold’s
ﬁrst theorem for bT > 1 + r−1
1 = 3 and any value of b (cf. also ﬁgure 2,
lower-right panel).

Vertical dashed lines in each panel of ﬁgure 4 indicate the values of b for
marginal stability, denoted by b±. In the 3-layer model, b− = min{−ρ, ρr1(1
−bT)} and b+ = max{ρr1(1 − bT), ρ2r1r2bT}, whereas for the 2.5-layer
model, b− = −ρ and b+ = ρr1(1 − bT). Note that in the 2.5-layer model,
while the b− marginal stability value remains ﬁxed at b ≈ −0.66667, the b+
moves toward smaller values as bT increases, until it collapses with b− at
bT = 3 (not shown in the ﬁgure). For b > b+ and b < b− the basic ﬂow in
both the 2.5- and 3-layer models is nonlinearly stable. For b+ < b < b− the
basic ﬂow is unstable unless the zonal channel ﬂow is narrow enough for
Arnold’s second stability theorem to be fulﬁlled. The latter is not always
true in the 3-layer model case, however, since there is a possibility that a
spectrally stable basic state could become unstable through ERI.

Three-layer surface-conﬁned ﬂows are susceptible to suﬀer more desta-
bilization than 2.5-layer ﬂows. However, the state space available, (deter-
mined by the fraction of total potential enstrophy), for eddy-amplitude
growth in the 3-layer model tends to be smaller than the space available
in the 2.5-layer model, at least for certain basic state parameters. This is
evident in the upper three panels of ﬁgure 4. There is an overall tendency
of the 3-layer model bound to decrease as bT increases. Moreover, for a
large set of parameters this bound reduces to only a small fraction of
the total enstrophy of the system. In these cases, the signiﬁcance of the
associated instabilities is relative. On the other hand, there are basic state
parameters for which this fraction is not negligible. As an example not
shown in the ﬁgure, for b = −0.35 and bT = 2.5, which are appropriate for
a region similar to the ANEC, the fraction of total enstrophy is about 45%,
which is not negligible. Of course, when the upper bounds are not small
enough, no unambiguous conclusion can be drawn about the signiﬁcance of
an instability.

Figure 4 also shows that the 3-layer model bound can be signiﬁcantly

small for certain potentially ERI unstable ﬂows (cf. lower two panels in
the ﬁgure). This also allows us to make an unambiguous assessment of
the signiﬁcance of these type of instabilities in the sense that they can be
certainly negligible for some basic state parameters.

Before closing this section, two points deserve additional discussion.
First, the result that the bounds for the 3-layer model with a very thick
deep layer are smaller than the 2.5-layer model bounds in the region of
parameters where the two models share similar instability properties might
seem at odds with the fact that the 3-layer model is less constrained than
the 2.5-layer model, which allows for the development of more unstable
states. However, we believe that this result should not be surprising inas-
much as the space over which the minimization is carried out is larger in
the 3-layer model than in the 2.5-layer model, which oﬀers the possibility of
ﬁnding tighter bounds (cf. Olascoaga, 2001). Second, Paret and Vanneste
(1996) were not able to draw a conclusion on the signiﬁcance of ERI in-
stability as in the present paper. These authors computed energy-norm
saturation bounds, according to both Arnold’s ﬁrst and second theorems,
using numerical minimization algorithms. These bounds, whose analytical
computation appears to be too diﬃcult, were not found to minimize at
basic state parameters for which ERI instability is possible. The analytical
minimization involved in the derivation of the enstrophy-norm of this paper
has shown that the tightest bounds are obtained using stable basic states
whose parameters have quite spread numerical values. The minimization
thus requires to search for a solution in a considerably large space, making
numerical computations extremely expensive. This might explain the diﬃ-
culty of Paret and Vanneste (1996) to ﬁnd tighter bounds for potentially
ERI unstable basic ﬂows.

5. Concluding Remarks

A previous study showed that the quasigeostrophic baroclinic instability
properties of a surface-conﬁned zonal current may diﬀer substantially be-
tween a 2.5-layer model and a 3-layer, if the former is considered to be a
simpliﬁed 3-layer model with a very thick deep layer. For certain basic state
parameters, the 2.5-layer model predicts nonlinear stability whereas the 3-
layer model spectral instability. That study thus suggested that the eﬀects
of the deep ocean on the baroclinic instability of the upper thermocline
layer of the ocean may be important for certain currents.

In this paper we have made further assessments of the importance of
the deep ocean on upper baroclinic instability. We have achieved this by
analyzing (i) maximum normal-mode perturbation growth rates and (ii)
rigorous enstrophy-norm upper bounds on the growth of perturbations to

unstable basic states, in both 2.5- and 3-layer models of baroclinic instabil-
ity. The new results show that instabilities, which the 3-layer model predicts
in the region of basic state parameters where the 2.5-layer model predicts
nonlinear stability, appear to maximize their growth rates. At the same
time, however, the saturation bounds tend to minimize in this same region
of basic state parameters, thereby reducing the size of state space available
for eddy-amplitude growth. Moreover, for a large subset of parameters in
the region, the latter reduces to only a small fraction of the total enstrophy
of the system. In these cases we have been able to make unambiguous
assessments of the signiﬁcance of the associated instabilities in the sense
that they can be certainly negligible.

We close remarking that the important issue of making assessments of
the accuracy of the saturation bounds as predictors of equilibrated eddy
amplitudes is still largely open. This cannot be addressed without per-
forming direct numerical simulations. The importance of this subject relies
upon the potential of the bounds in the architecture of transient-eddy
parametrization schemes. The treatment of these issues are reserved for
future investigation.

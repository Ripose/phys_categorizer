Abstract

We are developing schemes that predict future hurricane numbers by ﬁrst predicting future sea
surface temperatures (SSTs), and then apply the observed statistical relationship between SST and
hurricane numbers. As part of this overall goal, in this study we compare the historical performance
of three simple statistical methods for making ﬁve-year SST forecasts. We also present SST forecasts
for 2006-2010 using these methods and compare them to forecasts made from two structural time
series models.

1 Introduction

The number of hurricanes occurring in the Atlantic Ocean basin has increased in recent years, and this
has led to considerable interest in trying to predict future levels of hurricane activity. One sector of
society that is particularly interested in the number of hurricanes that may occur in the future is the
insurance industry, which pays out large amounts of money when severe hurricanes make landfall in the
US. The timescales over which this industry is most interested in forecasts of hurricane activity are,
roughly speaking, a zero-to-two year timescale, for underwriters to set appropriate insurance rates, and a
zero-to-ﬁve year timescale, to allow ﬁnancial planners to ensure that their business has suﬃcient capital
to withstand potential losses.
Motivated by this, we are in the process of building a set of models for the prediction of future hurricane
numbers over these timescales. The models in our set are based on diﬀerent methodologies and assump-
tions, in an attempt to understand how diﬀerent methodologies and assumptions can impact the ultimate
predictions. Within the set, one subset of methods is based on the idea of ﬁrst predicting sea surface
temperatures (SSTs), and then predicting hurricane numbers as a function of the predicted SSTs. The
rationale for this approach is that there is a clear correlation between SST and hurricane numbers, such
that greater numbers of hurricanes occur in years with warmer SSTs. How, then, should we predict SSTs
in order to make hurricane number predictions on this basis?
Meagher and Jewson (2006) compared three simple statistical methods for the one-year forecasting of
tropical Atlantic SST. Their results show that the relative skill levels of the forecasts produced by the
diﬀerent methods they consider is determined by a trade-oﬀ between bias and variance. Bias can be
reduced by using a two parameter trend prediction model, but a one parameter model that ignores
the trend has lower variance and ultimately gives better predictions when skill is measured using mean
square error. How are these results likely to change as we move from considering one-year forecasts to
considering ﬁve-year forecasts? For ﬁve year forecasts both bias and variance are likely to increase, but
not necessarily in the same way, and as a result which model performs best might be expected to change
compared to the results of Meagher and Jewson (2006). We therefore extend their study to investigate
which methods and parameter sets perform best for ﬁve year predictions.
We also consider 2 new statistical models, known as ‘local level’ and ‘local linear’ models. These models
are examples of so-called structural time-series models and are commonly used in Econometrics. We
produce SST forecasts using these 2 additional methods, and compare the forecasts with those from our
original set of 3 methods.

2 Data

As in Meagher and Jewson (2006) we use the SST dataset HadISST (Rayner et al., 2002), which contains
monthly mean SSTs from 1870 to 2005 on a 1ox1o grid. As in Meagher and Jewson (2006), we deﬁne
a Main Development Region SST index as the average of the SSTs in the region (10o-20oN, 15o-70oW),
although we diﬀer from Meagher and Jewson (2006) in that we now use a July to September average
rather than a June to November average. This is because July to September SSTs show a slightly higher
correlation with annual hurricane numbers than the June to November SSTs.
The HadISST data is not updated in real-time, and so to update this dataset to the end of 2006 we
use the NOAA Optimal Interpolation SST V2 data which is available from 1981 to the present. The
July-September MDR index derived from the NOAA dataset is highly correlated with that derived from
HADISST (with linear correlation coeﬃcient of 0.98).

3 Method

Following Meagher and Jewson (2006) we compare three simple methods for predicting SST using back-
testing on the MDR SST timeseries. Meagher and Jewson (2006) tested 1 year forecasts while we now
test 1-5 year forecasts.
The basic 3 methods we use are:

1. Flat-line (FL): a trailing moving average

2. Linear trend (LT): a linear trend ﬁtted to the data and extrapolated to predict the next ﬁve years

3. Damped linear trend (DLT): An ‘optimal’ combination of the ﬂat-line and linear trend (originally

from Jewson and Penzer (2004)).

We compare predictions from these methods with predictions from two structural time series prediction
methods which are common in Econometrics (see for example Harvey and Shephard (1993)). These
models are:

• a local level model, that assumes that the historic SST time series is a random walk plus noise.

• a local linear trend model, that assumes that the historic SST time series is a random walk plus

random walk trend plus noise

The local level model has two parameters (the amplitude of the random walk and the amplitude of the
noise) and captures the idea that the level of SST changes over time, but with some memory. The local
linear trend model has three parameters (the amplitude of the basic random walk, the amplitude of the
random walk for the trend, and the amplitude of noise) and additionally captures the idea that SST is
inﬂuenced by a slowly changing trend. We ﬁt the two structural time-series model to the historical data
using maximum likelihood.

4 Results

4.1 Backtesting skill

To compare the three basic prediction methods, 5 year periods from 1911-1915 to 2001-2005 were predicted
(or ‘hindcasted’) using from 5 to 40 years of prior data. Figure 1 shows the RMS error for all three models
versus the number of years of prior data used. The upper left panel shows the score for 5-year forecasts,
and the other ﬁve panels show the scores for separate forecasts for 1 to 5 years ahead.
Considering ﬁrst the RMSE score for the 5-year forecast, we see that the ﬂat-line model with a window
length of 8-10 years performs best. Next best is the damped linear trend model for a window length
of around 17 years. Worst of the three models is the linear trend model, which has an optimal window
length of 24 years. The damped linear trend and linear trend models do very badly for short window
lengths, because of the huge uncertainty in the trend parameters when estimated using so little data.
Their performance is then very stable for window lengths longer than 13 years.
We now consider the forecasts for the individual years. First we note that the RMSE scores of these
forecasts are scarcely lower than the RMSE score for the 5 year forecast. This is presumably because the
ability of our simple methods to predict SST comes from the representation of long time-scale processes.
Our methods do not capture any interannual time-scale phenomena. Second, we note that the optimal

window length for the ﬂat-line forecast gradually reduces from 11 years to 7 years as the lead time
increases. This is the expected behaviour of the ﬂat-line model when used to model data with a weak
trend.
To better understand the error behaviour of these prediction methods we decompose the RMSE into the
bias and the standard deviation of the error. Figure 2 shows the bias for the three models and ﬁgure 3
their standard deviations. The ﬂat line model shows a high bias which increases with the averaging period
and the lead time. This is because using a ﬂat-line cannot capture the trends in the data.
Figure 3 shows that it is the high variance in the predictions from the linear trend and damped linear trend
models, presumably due to high parameter uncertainty, which is responsible for their poor performance
when using small windows. The standard deviation of the ﬂat line model error is close to independent
of the lead time although we can see that the minimum is shifted to smaller window lengths for longer
forecasts.

4.2 Sensitivity of the results to the hindcast period

One obvious question concerns the stability of our results with respect to the hindcast data we have used.
Understanding this should give us some indication of the robustness of future forecasts. To check this
stability we apply a bootstrap technique by calculating the window-length dependent RMSE on bootstrap
samples of forecast years. Figure 4 shows the results for the ﬁve year forecast based on 1000 bootstrap
samples. The left panel shows the frequency in which one method outperforms the other two methods,
and the other panels show the distribution of optimal window lengths for the three methods. For a ﬁve
year forecast the ﬂat line method with a window length of 8 years is the best in almost all cases. In
contrast, the optimal window length of the linear methods is strongly dependent on the hindcast years
used. However we note that this is not necessarily a problem since the minima in the RMSE score for
these methods is very shallow and therefore an imperfect window length does not greatly reduce the
forecast quality.
Figure 5 shows the same experiment as the previous ﬁgure, but for a one year ahead forecast. Here the
linear trend models outperform the ﬂat line model in 40% of the bootstrap samples and the optimal win-
dow length of the ﬂat line method is around 10 years, conﬁrming the results given in Meagher and Jewson
(2006).

4.3 Forecast for 2006-2010 and comparison to structural time series model

forecasts

We now make forecasts for SST for the period 2006-2010 using the methods described above. Based on
the backtesting results we use the ﬂat line model with an 8 year window length, the linear trend model
with a 24 year window and the damped linear trend model with a 17 year window.
In addition we make forecasts with the local level and local linear structural time series models. Point
predictions from these models are the same as predictions from ARIMA(0,1,1) and ARIMA(0,2,2) models,
although predicted error distributions are diﬀerent.
Figure 6 shows the forecasts from the 3 simple methods, not including the structural models. As expected
the linear trend models predict higher SSTs than the ﬂat-line models. Curiously, the damped linear trend
model actually predicts higher SSTs and a greater trend slope than the linear trend model. This is because
it uses a shorter window length than the linear trend model. This unexpected behaviour slightly calls into
question the way the damped linear trend model is constructed, and suggests that there may be other
ways that one could construct such an optimal combination that might avoid this slightly awkward result.
It also highlights the fact that the optimal window length for the linear trend models is not terribly well
determined by the backtesting. Figure 7 also shows the predictions from the structural models. We see
that these predictions lie between the predictions from the ﬂat-line and linear trend models. Figure 8
shows the predictions from the 3 simple models, but now including (a) predicted RMSE scores for each
model based on the backtesting results, and (b) a prediction for 2006 based on data up to the end of 2005.
To estimate the 2006 MDR SST data we predict the July-September SST for 2006 using a linear model
with the NOAA Optimal Interpolation SST July-August data as predictor (1981 − 2005 : R2 = 0.913).
This point forecast and 90% conﬁdence intervals are plotted in the ﬁgure as a grey box.

5 Discussion

We have tested a number of simple statistical prediction schemes on historical SST data for the tropical
Atlantic to evaluate their forecast quality for a ﬁve year ahead SST forecast. Our results are similar to

those of Meagher and Jewson (2006), who tested the same prediction methods for year-ahead forecasting.
The ﬂat line method, a trailing moving average, performed best using a window length of 8 years, which is
slightly lower than the optimal window length for year-ahead forecasts. Next best was the damped linear
trend method with window lengths around 17 years. The linear trend method shows no advantage over
ﬂat-line and damped linear trend for any forecast periods or window length. By applying the hindcast
experiment on subsets of hindcast data we have shown that for the ﬁve year forecast the ﬂat line methods
nearly always outperform the linear trend methods whereas for a one year ahead forecast the linear
methods are sometimes more accurate.
It is worth remarking that the ﬁve year ahead forecasts we have described have only around 10% higher
It is likely that the one year ahead forecast can be
uncertainty than the one year ahead forecast.
improved signiﬁcantly by including additional information such as the ENSO state, but for the ﬁve year
ahead forecast the simple methods we have presented will be more diﬃcult to beat.
We have presented 5 year forecasts from both these simple methods and local level and local linear trend
structural time series models. The forecasts from these structural time-series methods lie in-between the
ﬂat line and linear trend forecasts and this suggests that one might consider the ﬂat line and linear trend
forecasts as lower and upper bounds.
One ﬁnal but important point is that our backtesting study has compared the performance of forecast
methods on average over the historical data. Are methods that have worked well over the period covered
by the historical data likely to work well in the future? Not necessarily, since we seem to be in a period of
rapid warming. Although there are similar periods of rapid warming in the historical data, there are also
periods of cooling, and our backtesting results reﬂect some kind of average performance over the two. If
we believe that the current warming will continue, then the methods that incorporate information about
the trend may do better than they have done over the historical period, and the methods that ignore the
trend may do worse than they have done over the historical period.

Comment on ”Scaling of Atmosphere
and Ocean Temperature Correlations in
Observations and Climate Models”
(submitted: March 18, 2003)

In a recent letter [1], Fraedrich and Blender (FB) studied the
scaling of atmosphere and ocean temperature. They analysed
monthly temperature records by using the detrended ﬂuctua-
tion analysis (DFA2) and claim that the scaling exponent α
over the inner continents is equal to 0.5, being characteristic
of uncorrelated random sequences. Here we show that also
for the inner continents, the exponent is between 0.6 and 0.7,
similar as for the coastline-stations.

FIG. 1.: Results of DFA2 for the daily maximum temperature
records of 18 inner continental stations (◦) and two coastline sta-
tions (×): (a) 1 Urumchi, 2 Tomsk, 3 Atbasar, 4 Chita, 5 Olekminsk,
6 Horog, 7 Swerdlowsk, 8 Surgut, 9 Jakutsk, 10 Aleksandrovsk; (b)

The estimated minimum distance to the oceans is written in paren-
theses. In order to better distinguish the exponent α from 0.5, we
plot F (s)/s0.5. The scale of F (s) is arbitrary. The straight lines in
the curves represent the asymptotic best ﬁt. The line at the bottom
has a slope of 0.15, corresponding to α = 0.65.

Figure 1 shows representative results of the ﬂuctuation
functions F (s) ∼ sα, obtained by DFA2, for 18 inner con-
tinental daily temperature records in North America and Asia,
where the stations are between 400 and 2600 km away from
the ocean. For comparison, we also show the results for two
coastline stations. The maximum s-value in each curve is be-
low one quarter of the length of the corresponding record. To
facilitate the evaluation of the data, we have divided F (s) by
s0.5. A plateau now indicates loss of correlations. One can
see clearly that none of the curves approaches a plateau, i. e.

an exponent α = 0.5 is never seen. All asymptotic slopes
shown by straight lines in the ﬁgure have values above 0.6.
For each curve, the error bar is below 0.02. There is no re-
markable difference between coastline and inner continental
stations. Figure 2 shows the dependence of α on the shortest
distance to the oceans. There is no tendency towards a lower
exponent at larger distances.

FIG. 2.: The scaling exponent α (obtained from the slopes of the
straight lines in Fig.1) as a function of the minimum distance to the
oceans. There appears no downward gradient towards larger dis-
tances. Inland stations do not show smaller exponents than stations
closer to the water.

It is worth noting that also Fig. 1a in [1] sheds doubts on the
FB claim. For large s-values, the three curves for Krasnojarsk
and corresponding regions in the observed grid data set do not
appear to approach the exponent 1/2. The ECHAM4/HOPE
model yields a slope above 0.6 for time scales up to 100 years,
and a considerably higher slope at even larger time scales. For
an earlier analysis of control runs, see Ref. [5] in [1].

Finally, we like to comment on the claim that α ≃ 1 for
sea surface temperatures. As has been shown in [2], there is
a remarkable crossover at about 2-3 years in the sea surface
temperatures: At small scales, the exponent is signiﬁcantly
larger than 1, α ≃ 1.3, while at large time scales α is between
0.65 and 0.95, with the average at 0.8.

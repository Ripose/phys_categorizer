1 Summary

In 1997 Svensmark and Friis-Christensen [1] announced a surprising discovery that global
cloud cover correlates closely with the galactic cosmic ray intensity, which varies with
the sunspot cycle. Although clouds retain some of the Earth’s warmth, for most types of
cloud this is more than compensated by an increased reﬂective loss of the Sun’s radiation
back into space. So more clouds in general mean a cooler climate—and fewer clouds
mean global warming. The Earth is partly shielded from cosmic rays by the magnetic
disturbances carried by the solar wind. When the solar wind is strong, at the peak of
the 11-year sunspot cycle, fewer cosmic rays reach the Earth. The observed variation of
cloud cover was only a few per cent over the course of a sunspot cycle. Although this
may appear to be quite small, the possible long-term consequences on the global radiation
energy budget are not.

Beyond its semi-periodic 11-year cycle, the Sun displays unexplained behaviour on
longer timescales.
In particular, the strength of the solar wind and the magnetic ﬂux
it carries have more than doubled during the last century [2]. The extra shielding has
reduced the intensity of cosmic rays reaching the Earth’s atmosphere by about 15%,
globally averaged. This reduction of cosmic rays over the last century is independently
indicated by the light radioisotope record in the Greenland ice cores. If the link between
cosmic rays and clouds is conﬁrmed it implies global cloud cover has decreased during
the last century. Simple estimates indicate that the consequent global warming could be
comparable to that presently attributed to greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil
fuels.

These observations suggest that solar variability may be linked to climate variability
by a chain that involves the solar wind, cosmic rays and clouds. The weak link is the
connection between cosmic rays and clouds. This has not been unambiguously established
and, moreover, the microphysical mechanism is not understood. Cosmic rays are the
dominant source of ions in the free troposphere and stratosphere and they also create
free radicals.
It has been proposed [3]–[5] that ions may grow via clustering to form
aerosol particles which may ultimately become cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and
thereby seed clouds. Recently a search for massive ions in the upper troposphere and
lower stratosphere was started by MPIK-Heidelberg [6] using aircraft-based ion mass
spectrometers. Preliminary results indeed indicate the presence of massive positive and
negative ions. In addition to their eﬀect on aerosol formation and growth, cosmic rays
may also possibly enhance the formation of ice particles in clouds [7].

We therefore propose to test experimentally the link between cosmic rays and clouds
and, if conﬁrmed, to uncover the microphysical mechanism. We propose to make the
measurements under controlled laboratory conditions in a beam at the CERN Proton
Synchrotron (PS), which provides an adjustable source of “cosmic rays”. The experi-
ment, which is named CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor Droplets), is based on a cloud
chamber that is designed to duplicate the conditions prevailing in the atmosphere. To
our knowledge, cloud chamber data under these conditions have never been previously
obtained.

This document is organised as follows. First we provide an overview of the scien-
tiﬁc motivation for the experiment, including a summary of the most recent satellite
observations of clouds. We present the scientiﬁc and experimental goals of CLOUD in

1

Section 3. These are followed in Sections 4–7 by descriptions of the detector and its per-
formance, of the data interpretation and cloud modelling, and of the accelerator require-
ments. The planning for the experiment is summarised in Section 8. Since this proposal
concerns several diﬀerent scientiﬁc disciplines—atmospheric, solar-terrestrial and particle
physics—we provide fairly extensive background information, mostly in footnotes and in
Appendices A–E which cover, respectively, cloud physics, aerosol-cloud-climate interac-
tions, classical operation of a Wilson cloud chamber, cosmic rays in the atmosphere, and
cloud models.

2 Scientiﬁc motivation; the origins of climate change

2.1 Global warming

Global warming is a major concern of the world, with its potentially devastating eﬀects
on coastal settlements and world agriculture. The steep rise in greenhouse gas emissions
since the Industrial Revolution has increased the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere
by about 30%. This is widely believed to be the dominant cause of the observed rise of
about 0.6◦C in the global mean surface temperature during this period [8].

A small systematic rise or fall in the global temperature is caused by a net imbalance
(“forcing”) in the Earth’s energy radiation budget. The radiative forcing caused by the
increase in the CO2 fraction since 1750 is estimated to be 1.5 Wm−2 (Fig. 1) [8], compared
with the global average incoming solar radiation1 of 342 Wm−2, i.e. an imbalance of
only 0.4%. After including the eﬀects of all greenhouse gases (+2.45 Wm−2), aerosols2
(-0.5 Wm−2) and their indirect inﬂuence on clouds (-0.75 Wm−2, but poorly known), the
present net radiative forcing from mankind is estimated to be about 1.2 Wm−2.

The climate models [8] upon which the predictions of greenhouse warming depend
have gradually improved as new eﬀects and better data have been incorporated. They
now provide a reasonable match to the observed variation in global temperatures over the
last century. However they remain subject to signiﬁcant uncertainties, especially from
feedback mechanisms and from the eﬀects of anthropogenic aerosols. The latter contribute
directly by scattering and absorption of radiation and also indirectly by inﬂuencing cloud
formation. Nonetheless it is in this climate of scientiﬁc uncertainty that major political
decisions on greenhouse gas emissions are presently being made (Earth Summit in Rio
de Janeiro, 1992, and UN Climate Convention in Kyoto, 1997) that will have a profound
eﬀect on the economic development of both the developed and the developing countries.
The need for such political decisions to be based on sound scientiﬁc grounds is self evident,
and a major world-wide research eﬀort on climate change is underway.

1By convention, the incoming solar radiation of about 1366 Wm−2 is averaged over the total surface

area of the Earth, i.e. divided by a factor four, to give a global average of 342 Wm−2.

2Aerosols are 0.001–1 µm diameter particles of liquid or solid suspended in the air [9]. Atmospheric
aerosols include dust, sea salt, soot (elemental carbon), organic compounds from biomass burning, sul-
phates (especially H2SO4 and (NH4)2SO4) from SO2, and nitrates (especially HNO3) from NO and NO2.

Figure 1: IPCC estimates of the global annual averaged radiative forcings due to changes
in anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols from 1850–1992 (ﬁrst seven columns of
the ﬁgure) [8]. Positive forcings lead to a warming and negative forcings cause a cooling.
Natural changes due to the Sun are indicated by the ﬁnal two columns; the ﬁrst is the
IPCC estimate of changes in solar output over the same period and the second concerns
the present CLOUD proposal to study of the inﬂuence of galactic cosmic rays on cloud
formation. Since the galactic cosmic ray ﬂux is modulated by the solar wind, this would
provide a mechanism for indirect solar radiative forcing.

2.2 Solar variability

In order to determine the inﬂuence of mankind on climate change it is ﬁrst necessary
to understand the natural causes of variability. A natural eﬀect that has been hard to
understand physically is an apparent link between the weather and solar activity—the
sunspot3 cycle.

The observation that warm weather seems to coincide with high sunspot counts and
cool weather with low sunspot counts was made as long ago as two hundred years by the
astronomer William Herschel [11] who noticed that the price of wheat in England was
lower when there were many sunspots, and higher when there were few. The best known
example of this eﬀect is known as the Maunder Minimum [12], the Little Ice Age between
1645 and 1715—which ironically almost exactly coincides with the reign of Louis XIV,
3Sunspots are areas of the Sun’s photosphere where strong local magnetic ﬁelds (typically 2500 Gauss,
to be compared with the Earth’s ﬁeld of about 0.3 Gauss) emerge vertically [10]. They appear dark
because their temperature is about half of the surrounding photosphere (3,000 K compared with 5,800 K).
They are generated by the diﬀerential rotation of the Sun with respect to latitude: one revolution takes
25 days at the equator and 28 days at mid-latitudes. This transforms the quiescent dipole ﬁeld into
a toroidal ﬁeld and eventually creates “knots” of strong localised ﬁelds. These knots may penetrate
the photosphere to form sunspots, which appear cooler due to modiﬁcation of the normal convective
motions of the plasma by the strong magnetic ﬁelds. The sunspots ﬁrst appear at high latitudes and then
gradually migrate towards the equator. They eventually disappear by magnetic recombination, leaving
a quiescent dipole ﬁeld once more (but of opposite polarity). The cycle from dipole to toroidal and back
to dipole ﬁeld is known as the solar (sunspot) cycle and takes about 11 years on average.

and the temperature anomaly of the Northern Hemisphere (dashed curve) [16]. The
temperature data are from the IPCC [8].

Figure 3: Satellite measurements of the variation of the Sun’s irradiance over two solar
cycles [19]. Sunspot maxima occurred around the beginning of 1981 and mid 1990, and
sunspot minima occurred around the beginning of 1986 and 1996. The rapid ﬂuctua-
tions are due to sunspots rotating into the ﬁeld of view. The solid line represents the
smoothed data. The measurements are from active cavity irradiance monitors (ACRIM
I and II) on the Solar Maximum Mission Satellites and from HF-type radiometers on the
Nimbus 7 Earth Radiation Budget (ERB) and Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS)
experiments.

le Roi Soleil, 1643–1715—during which time there was an almost complete absence of
sunspots. During this period the River Thames in London regularly froze across and fairs
complete with swings, sideshows and food stalls were a standard winter feature.

Since that time there have been numerous observations and non-observations of an
apparent link between climate and the sunspot cycle [13]–[15]. One example of a positive
observation was presented by Friis-Christensen and Lassen in 1991 (Fig. 2) [16]. They
used the sunspot cycle length as a measure of the Sun’s activity. The cycle length averages
11 years but has varied from 7 to 17 years, with shorter cycle lengths corresponding to a
more magnetically-active Sun. A correlation was found between the sunspot cycle length
and the change in land temperature of the Northern Hemisphere in the period between
1861 and 1989. The land temperature of the northern hemisphere was used in order to
avoid the lag by several years of air temperatures over the oceans, due to their large
heat capacity. The data shown in Fig. 2 cover the period during which greenhouse gas
emissions are believed to be the major cause of the global warming of 0.6◦C. Of particular
note is the dip between 1945 and 1970, which cannot be explained by the steadily rising
greenhouse gas emissions but seems to coincide with a decrease in the Sun’s activity.

In the absence of suﬃciently sensitive measurements, it was suspected that the Sun’s
irradiance may be ﬂuctuating over the solar cycle. However, the steadiness of the Sun’s
irradiance over almost two sunspot cycles has recently been established by satellite mea-
surements (Fig. 3) [17]-[19]. The solar irradiance is slightly higher at sunspot maximum;
although sunspots are cooler and have reduced emission, this is more than compensated
by an associated increase in nearby bright areas known as plages and faculae. The mean
irradiance changes by about 0.1% from sunspot maximum to minimum which, if represen-
tative over a longer time interval, is too small (0.3 Wm−2, globally-averaged) to account
for the observed changes in the Earth’s temperature. However it is not completely neg-
ligible, and current estimates—using the data shown in Fig. 3 together with the sunspot
record—attribute a net direct radiative forcing over this century of about +0.3 Wm−2
due to changes in solar irradiance (indicated by the “solar - direct eﬀect” in Fig. 1).

2.3 Cosmic rays and cloud variability

It is well known that the cosmic ray intensity on Earth is strongly inﬂuenced by the solar
wind4 [20], whose strength varies with the sunspot cycle (Fig. 4 and Appendix D.2). The
solar wind contains frozen-in irregular magnetic ﬁelds. Galactic cosmic rays that enter
the solar system suﬀer many scatters from these irregularities and undergo a random
walk. This has been theoretically shown [21] to be equivalent to a heliocentric retarding
electric potential, which varies over the course of the solar cycle. At times of low sunspot
activity, the solar wind is weaker and the retarding potential at the Earth’s orbit is about
400 MV. At times of high sunspot activity, the retarding potential is about 1200 MV,
thereby reducing the low-energy component of galactic cosmic radiation reaching Earth.

4The solar wind is a continuous outward ﬂow of charged particles (mainly protons and electrons, with
5% helium nuclei) from the plasma of the Sun’s corona. Sources include streams from a honeycomb of
magnetic ﬁelds in the solar atmosphere, and large and small mass ejections. The solar wind creates the
huge heliosphere of the Sun that extends out 50–100 AU, well beyond the orbit of Neptune. At the
Earth’s orbit the solar wind has a velocity of 350–800 km s−1 (β = 0.001–0.003) and an intensity of
(0.5–5)

108 particles cm−2 s−1, carrying with it a magnetic ﬁeld of about 5

10−5 Gauss.

Figure 4: Variation with time of sunspot number and cosmic ray ﬂux, as measured by
ground-based neutron counters. The neutron data are from the University of Chicago neu-
tron monitor stations at Climax, Colorado (3400 m elevation; 3 GeV/c primary charged
particle cutoﬀ), Huancayo, Peru (3400 m; 13 GeV/c cutoﬀ) and Haleakala, Hawaii (3030
m; 13 GeV/c cutoﬀ). The stronger modulation of the cosmic ray ﬂux at higher latitudes
(Climax) is due to the lower primary cutoﬀ energy. The neutrons are mostly produced by
primary hadronic interactions in the ﬁrst 1–2 λint of the atmosphere and therefore mea-
sure the changes in cosmic ray intensity at altitudes above about 13 km. The primary
cosmic radiation is about 80% protons, 15% He nuclei and 5% heavier nuclei. At sea level
the most numerous charged particles are muons and their ﬂuctuation is less pronounced—
about 3% over a solar cycle [20]—since they are produced from the high-energy component
of cosmic radiation, which is less aﬀected by the solar wind.

The cosmic rays are also deﬂected by the Earth’s geomagnetic ﬁeld, which they must
penetrate to reach the troposphere.5 This sets a minimum vertical momentum of primary
charged particles at the geomagnetic equator of about 15 GeV/c, decreasing to below
0.1 GeV/c at the geomagnetic poles. (The actual cutoﬀ at high latitudes is determined
by the atmospheric material; for example a 1 GeV/c proton can penetrate only as far
as 15 km altitude.) As a result the modulation of the cosmic ray intensity is more
pronounced at higher geomagnetic latitudes (Figs. 4 and 52). Averaged over the globe,
the variation of the cosmic ray ﬂux is about 15% between solar maximum and minimum
5The troposphere is the lowest level of the atmosphere and the region where there is enough water
vapour and vertical mixing for clouds to form under suitable conditions. The troposphere has a depth
of about 18 km over the tropics, decreasing to about 8 km over the poles; it contains about 80% of the
mass of the atmosphere. The troposphere is divided into the planetary boundary layer, extending from
the Earth’s surface up to about 1 km, and the free troposphere, extending from 1 km to the boundary
with the stratosphere (the tropopause). There is an overall adiabatic lapse rate of temperature in the
troposphere of between 6◦C (moist air) and 9.7◦C (dry air) per km altitude, reaching a minimum of
about -56◦C at the tropopause. The stratosphere extends up to about 50 km and has a temperature that
slowly rises with altitude due to absorption of solar UV radiation. This leads to very little turbulence
and vertical mixing and, in consequence, it contains relatively warm, dry air that is largely free of clouds.

[22, 23]. It represents one of the largest measurable eﬀects of sunspot activity near the
Earth’s surface.

But how could cosmic rays aﬀect the Earth’s weather? The energy deposited by cosmic
rays is only a few parts per billion compared with the incident solar energy, so a strong
amplifying mechanism would be necessary. The breakthrough was made by Svensmark
and Friis-Christensen in 1997 [1] who discovered an unexpected correlation between global
cloud cover and the incident cosmic ray intensity. The satellite data, which are shown in
Fig. 5 (taken from the later ref. [24]), display a clear imprint of the solar cycle on global
cloud cover.6 Over a sunspot cycle, the absolute variation of global cloud cover is about
3%, to be compared with an average total cloud cover of about 65%, i.e. a relative fraction
of about 5%.

Figure 5: Absolute percentage variation of global cloud cover observed by satellites (data
points; left hand scale) and relative percentage variation of cosmic ray ﬂux (solid curve,
normalised to May 1965; near-right hand scale) [1, 24]. Also shown is the solar 10.7 cm
microwave ﬂux (dashed curve, in units of 10−22 Wm−2Hz−1; far-right hand scale). The
cloud data are restricted to oceans; Nimbus 7 (triangles) and DMSP (diamonds) data are
for the southern hemisphere over oceans, and ISCCP-C2 (squares) data are for oceans
with the tropics excluded. The error bars indicate representative statistical errors. The
cosmic ray data are neutron measurements from Climax (Fig. 4). All data are smoothed
using a 12-month running mean. A more recent analysis is shown in Figs. 6 and 7.

In addition to this observation of cloud variations over the timescale of order one solar
cycle, other data sets have been analysed to investigate transient eﬀects on clouds due to
sudden changes in the cosmic ray ﬂux. Forbush decreases of galactic cosmic rays occur
due to solar disturbances on timescales of order days and therefore allow study of short-
term cosmic-ray induced changes. Pudovkin and Veretenenko [25] report observations
of a short-term decrease of cloudiness that correlates with Forbush decreases, using a
superposed epoch analysis on data obtained visually. Their observation is restricted to a
narrow range of latitudes (60N–64N), and they suggest that cirrus clouds are responsible.

6The terms cloud cover, cloud frequency and cloud fraction are interchangeable.

7

A similar analysis of the eﬀects of Forbush decreases on rainfall has been carried out by the
Lebedev Physical Institute [26] using data from 50 meteorological stations in Brazil for 47
Forbush events recorded between 1956 and 1992. A 30% drop in rainfall (corresponding
to a 3σ change from the mean) is observed on the initial day of the onset of the Forbush
decrease.

A detailed mechanism modifying ice clouds has been proposed in a series of papers
(notably Tinsley and Dean [7]), which suggests that signiﬁcant changes in the latent heat
released within supercooled clouds can occur as a result of aerosol electriﬁcation. The
proposed mechanism is that charged aerosols are more eﬀective than neutral aerosols as
ice nuclei, which are generally rare in the atmosphere. The aerosol electriﬁcation is due to
the ionisation created by cosmic rays. Rather than a comparison with cloudiness, Tins-
ley’s superposed epoch analysis uses a dynamical parameter, the Vorticity Area Index (a
measure of the regional scale motion), for which he ﬁnds a correlation with Forbush de-
creases. The mechanism of latent heat release via electrical enhancement of ice nucleation
can lead to substantial ampliﬁcation of the ionisation energy deposited by cosmic rays in
the atmosphere.

2.4 Other solar-induced climate variability

Other solar activity also follows the sunspot cycle, so in principle the cloud variations
might be attributed to (a) a direct eﬀect of cosmic rays on clouds, (b) a direct eﬀect of
other solar activity on clouds, or (c) an eﬀect of solar activity on global weather that
indirectly results in a change in cloud cover.

Although the other explanations mentioned here cannot be ruled out, Fig. 5 contains
evidence favouring (a), the direct cosmic ray eﬀect, which is to be investigated in the
CLOUD experiment. The solar 10.7 cm microwave ﬂux is a good proxy both for varia-
tions in the sunspot count and for variations in the solar output of other electromagnetic
radiation, namely visible light, X-rays and ultraviolet rays. In Fig. 5, the change in cloud
fraction followed the cosmic rays closely but sometimes lagged as much as two years
behind the change in the 10.7 cm ﬂux. Delays in cosmic ray variations occur because dis-
turbances in the solar wind, which scatter the cosmic rays, involve events (coronal mass
ejections—CMEs, and co-rotating interaction regions) only loosely related to the sunspot
count. Moreover the heliosphere is so large that disturbances can take up to about a year
to reach its boundary, the heliopause. The delays show that the cloud variations correlate
more closely with the cosmic rays than with the solar electromagnetic ﬂux.

Could the solar wind have a direct eﬀect on clouds, while coincidentally modulating
the cosmic rays? This is unlikely because solar wind protons have very little energy (a
few keV) and if they penetrate the Earth’s magnetosphere in the auroral zone, the outer
atmosphere stops them at altitudes above 100 km. Shock waves associated with CME
disturbances colliding with the slow solar wind can accelerate protons to 100 MeV or
more, generating solar cosmic rays, but only rarely do they have suﬃcient energy to reach
the tropopause at 8–18 km altitude.

The sign of the eﬀect is a consideration in assessing possible solar mechanisms inﬂu-
encing the cloud fraction. While the cloud fraction correlates positively with the cosmic
ray intensity, it correlates negatively with the solar electromagnetic radiation and with
the strength of the solar wind. If enhancements in electromagnetic radiation or the solar

8

wind were responsible for a direct eﬀect on clouds, they would be in the counter-intuitive
sense of reducing the cloud fraction.

As to whether changes in cloud fraction might be an indirect result of changes in global
weather due to solar eﬀects that coincide with the cosmic ray modulation, none of the
other mechanisms on oﬀer for a solar role in climate change suggests an eﬀect on cloud
fraction. Mechanisms currently discussed include:

•

•

•

Increases in visible light, causing warming at the Earth’s surface.
Increases in ultraviolet (UV), causing warming in the stratosphere [28].7
Solar-induced turbulence in the Earth’s outer atmosphere that scatters gravity waves
back to the lower stratosphere, again with warming eﬀects [29].

All of these mechanisms seem likely to aﬀect the geographical distribution of clouds,
in particular by a poleward shift of the mid-latitude jet streams and depressions, during
high solar activity. There is no obvious short-term link with cloud fraction.

Solar activity has many manifestations, and all of the means by which it may inﬂuence
the Earth’s climate deserve further investigation. It is no part of our case to suggest that
the link between cosmic rays and clouds is the only important solar-climatic mechanism.
For the reasons given in this section we nevertheless consider that the preferred interpre-
tation of Figure 5 is the simplest, namely that cloud behaviour is directly inﬂuenced by
cosmic rays. The opinion is reinforced by recent studies summarised in the next section.

2.5

Improved satellite measurements of clouds

Currently the best continuous satellite observations of cloud properties are from the In-
ternational Satellite Cloud Climate Project (ISCCP) D2 data, which covers the period
from July 1983 to September 1994 [31, 32]. The D2 data are constructed by combining
uniform analysis results from several satellites—up to ﬁve geostationary satellites and two
polar orbiting satellites—to obtain complete global coverage every 3 hours. Cloud mea-
surements are made at visible (λ
0.6 µm), near infra-red (3.7 µm) and infra-red (IR)
wavelengths (10–12 µm). The IR measurements have the advantage that they provide
continuous detection through day and night. As well as cloud frequency, the cloud-top
temperatures and pressures are also determined. The temperatures and pressures are
obtained by assuming an opaque cloud, i.e. an emissivity ǫ = 1, and adjusting the cloud’s
pressure level (eﬀectively the cloud-top altitude) in the model until the reconstructed
outgoing IR ﬂux matches that observed. The clouds are classiﬁed into 3 altitude ranges
according to the pressure at their top surface: low, >680 hPa (approximately <3.2 km);
middle, 680–440 hPa (3.2–6.5 km); and high, <440 hPa (>6.5 km).

∼

The cloud frequency for high, middle and low IR clouds is shown in Fig. 6 together
with the cosmic ray variation over the same period [33]. In contrast with the previous
7Only wavelengths above 300 nm penetrate to the troposphere and the Earth’s surface. These show
a tiny peak-to-peak variation of less than 0.1% over the solar cycle. However the variation is more
pronounced in the UV. Wavelengths below 300 nm, which account for only about 2% of the total solar
irradiance, vary by about 5% (200–300 nm) to 50% (100–150 nm), or even more at shorter wavelengths
[27]. The UV radiation is absorbed by ozone in the upper stratosphere, which warms as a result. This
has the potential to inﬂuence large-scale dynamics of the troposphere [28]-[30], although vertical mixing
between the stratosphere and troposphere is weak.

9

analyses [1, 24], these data are spatially and temporally unrestricted; they include clouds
over the entire globe, during both day and night. The data indicate the presence of
a signiﬁcant correlation between cosmic ray intensity and the frequency of low clouds,
below about 3.2 km, but none with clouds at higher altitudes. Since the cosmic ray and
ionisation intensities—and their variations over the solar cycle—are largest above about
10 km altitude (Appendix D and Fig. 50), this would suggest mixing from the upper to

tropospheric dynamics, where large-scale vertical transport of air, chemical species and
ions can occur on timescales as short as a few hours via strong convective updrafts and
the accompanying downdrafts.

Figure 7 shows the low IR cloud fraction together with the variations of cosmic ray
ﬂux (solid line) and 10.7 cm solar irradiance over this period. The data are smoothed
using a 12-month running mean to allow easy comparison with the earlier analysis shown
in Fig. 5. The data conﬁrm the presence of a solar cycle modulation of the cloud fraction,
and continue to favour the cosmic ray interpretation.

The global map of the low cloud frequency correlation is shown in Fig. 8a) [33]. The
fraction of the Earth’s surface with a correlation coeﬃcient above 0.6 is 14.2%. Figure 8b)
shows the correlation of low IR cloud-top temperature and cosmic ray ﬂux. A strong
and continuous band of high correlation (>0.6) extends throughout the tropics, covering
29.6% of the globe. This is a surprising result since the solar modulation of the cosmic
ray intensity is a minimum near the geomagnetic equator, with a peak variation about 5%
(Fig. 4). No signiﬁcant correlations are observed between cosmic rays and the cloud-top
temperatures of middle and high clouds (these data are not mapped here).

In summary, the ISCCP-D2 IR cloud data show a clear correlation of the cosmic ray
intensity with low clouds, below about 3 km altitude (largely comprising stratocumulus
and stratus cloud types), and no correlation with higher clouds. (As before, these data
could alternatively be interpreted as a possible solar-cloud link via the UV irradiance.)
The correlation appears in two distinct parameters: a) the cloud frequency (coverage),
and b) the cloud-top temperature. The spatial distribution of the correlation across the
globe is diﬀerent in the two cases; the regions of high correlation of cloud frequency are
widely scattered whereas the cloud-top temperature correlation is essentially continuous
over the entire tropics. At present the reason for these diﬀerent spatial distributions is not
known, although we note that these are two separate cloud properties. Cloud frequency
measures the presence or absence of a cloud, reﬂecting changes in the cloud lifetimes,
cloud sizes, or cloud number. On the other hand, the inferred cloud-top temperature
depends on its altitude and on the microphysical properties of existing clouds.

The signs of the two correlations are that more cosmic rays give more clouds and a
higher cloud-top temperature. Under the assumption of opaque clouds, the cloud-top
temperature eﬀectively measures the altitude at the top of the cloud; a higher cloud-
top temperature implies a lower cloud. However the observed properties of low maritime
clouds suggest that they are not opaque [34]. If the assumption of opaque clouds is relaxed,
an alternative interpretation is that the cloud altitude does not change with increasing
cosmic ray ﬂux, but that the emissivity of the cloud increases. The latter could be caused
by microphysical changes such as an increase in the droplet number concentration.

2.6 Eﬀect of clouds on the Earth’s radiation energy budget

The net radiative properties of a cloud are mainly dependent on its altitude and optical
thickness. Optically-thin clouds at high and middle altitudes cause a net warming due to
their relative transparency at short wavelengths but opacity in the IR region, whereas thick
clouds produce a net cooling due to the dominance of the increased albedo of shortwave
solar radiation. Since the data of Fig. 6 indicate that the solar modulation appears in the
low clouds, the sign of the cosmic-climate eﬀect is now known: increased cosmic rays are
associated with increased low-clouds and therefore with a cooler climate.

Estimates from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) indicate, overall,
that clouds reﬂect more energy than they trap, leading to a net cooling of about 28 Wm−2
from the mean global cloud cover of 63% (Table 1) [35]. The observed absolute variation
in low cloud cover of about 2% over a solar cycle (Fig. 6c) corresponds to about 7% relative
variation. From Table 1, this would imply a solar maximum-to-minimum change in the
Earth’s radiation budget of about 1.2 Wm−2 (0.3% of the global average incoming solar
radiation). This is a signiﬁcant eﬀect—comparable to the total estimated radiative forcing
of 1.5 Wm−2 from the increase in CO2 concentration during the last century.

Table 1: Global annual mean forcing due to various types of clouds, from the Earth
Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) [35]. The sign is deﬁned so that positive forcing
increases the net radiation budget of the Earth and leads to a warming; negative forcing
decreases the net radiation and causes a cooling.

2.7 History of cosmic rays and climate change

If the periodic 11-year cycles of the sunspots and the associated cosmic ray ﬂux were the
end of the story, then it would be of limited concern since there would be no resultant
long-term change in the Earth’s weather but simply another cyclic “seasonal” change
(albeit with a period of 11 years and therefore heavily damped by the thermal mass of the
oceans). However there is clear evidence of longer-term and unexplained changes both in
the Sun’s and in the Earth’s magnetic behaviours and these, in turn, seem to have had
long-term eﬀects on the Earth’s climate.

2.7.1 Global warming during the past century

The light radio-isotope record: Direct measurement of cosmic rays with particle
detectors has been systematically carried out only during the last 50 years. However

13

there exists another reliable record of cosmic ray ﬂuxes on Earth, which stretches back
for at least 200 millennia: the light radio-isotope record [22, 36, 23]. Light radio-isotopes
are continually created in the atmosphere by spallation of N and O atoms. The spallation
interactions are induced mainly by low energy neutrons created in the secondary reactions
of cosmic rays: protons, alphas and heavier particles. The two long-lived radioisotopes
with the highest production rates are 14C (half life = (5730
40) years, and global mean
2.5 atoms cm−2s−1) and 10Be (half life = 1.5M years, global mean
production rate
∼

production rate
∼

In the case of 14C atoms, they are rapidly oxidised to form 14CO2. The turnover
time of CO2 in the atmosphere is quite short—about 4 years—mostly by absorption in
the oceans and assimilation in living plants. However, recirculation from the oceans has
the result that changes in the 14C fraction on timescales less than a few decades are
smoothed out. Plant material originally contains the prevailing atmospheric fraction of
14C and, subsequently, since the material is generally not recycled into the atmosphere,
the fraction decreases with the characteristic half life of 14C.

10−2 atoms cm−2s−1).

×

±

In the case of 10Be, after production it rapidly attaches to aerosols (solid or liquid)
and follows the motion of the surrounding air masses. Since the production of 10Be
follows the intensity proﬁle of the hadronic cosmic ray showers, about 2/3 is produced in
the stratosphere and 1/3 in the troposphere, globally averaged. Due to the tropopause
barrier, aerosols in the stratosphere take about 1–2 years to settle to the Earth’s surface,
whereas the mean residence time in the troposphere is only days or weeks. The removal
mechanism is rain and snow, and so seasonal variations of precipitation may distort any
measurements on timescales less than a year or so. In summary, despite a factor 100 lower
production rate than 14C, the advantages of 10Be are that it settles out relatively rapidly
(<
2 years) and it is not re-circulated into the atmosphere. It is therefore sensitive to
∼
changes in the cosmic ray ﬂux on short time scales of only a few years. On the other hand,
14C has the advantages that it is not polar-centric and is independent of precipitation
variability.

The change of cosmic ray intensity during the past century: Analysis of the
10Be concentration in a Greenland ice core (Fig. 9) [36] reveals that the cosmic ray ﬂux
has been steadily decreasing over the course of the last century; it is weaker today at
its maximum during the sunspot cycle than it was at its minimum around 1900. From
refs. [22] and [23], we estimate the global average reduction of cosmic ray intensity to be
about 15% over the last century (with a range of 10–25%). This estimate is supported by
direct measurements of cosmic rays over the last 40 years made by the Lebedev Physical
Institute using balloon-borne detectors (Table 2 and Appendix D.2) [37].

The cause of this systematic decrease in the cosmic ray ﬂux during the last century has
been a marked strengthening of the solar wind and the interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld it
carries into the heliosphere. This is revealed by the < aa > geomagnetic index,8 for which
there is a continuous record extending back to 1868, covering 12 sunspot cycles. Lockwood
et al. [2] have estimated the source magnetic ﬂux, Fs, that leaves the corona and enters
the heliosphere, from the level of geomagnetic activity seen at Earth in the < aa > index.
8The < aa > geomagnetic index is a sensitive measurement by two antipodal stations of short-term
(3-hour interval) variations of the geomagnetic ﬁeld at the Earth’s surface [38], which is aﬀected by the
interactions of the solar wind with the Earth’s magnetosphere.

This method to derive the coronal source ﬂux has been successfully tested against near-
Earth interplanetary space measurements made since 1963, during which time the coronal
source ﬂux of the Sun has been observed to rise a factor 1.4. In the period since 1901,
Lockwood et al. [2] calculate the increase to have been a factor 2.3 (Fig. 10). The reason
for this dramatic increase in the Sun’s magnetic activity is a mystery.

We have estimated the change in cosmic ray intensity over the last 140 years using
these coronal source ﬂux data. Scattering, gradient and curvature drifts caused by the he-
liospheric magnetic ﬁeld are the major contributor to the shielding of cosmic rays from the
Earth and a very strong anti-correlation between cosmic ray ﬂuxes with the heliospheric
ﬁeld near Earth was reported for the recent sunspot cycles 21 and 22 (Fig. 4). Thus an
anti-correlation of the source ﬂux Fs with cosmic ray ﬂuxes is expected. This is seen in
Fig. 11 which shows monthly mean counts, N, detected by the Climax neutron monitor in
the interval 1953-1998 as a function of the annual estimates of Fs made by Lockwood et
al.. The peak correlation (r = -0.874) is, essentially, 100% signiﬁcant and is obtained with
the cosmic ray ﬂuxes lagged by one month. The line shows a linear regression ﬁt to these
data which can be used, along with the Fs data sequence, to extrapolate the cosmic ray
ﬂux variation back to 1868. The percent variation of the cosmic ray ﬂux (relative to the
average value for solar cycle 21) derived this way is shown by the solid line in Fig. 12. This
extrapolation predicts a fall in the average cosmic ray ﬂuxes of about 20% since 1900 for
Climax (3 GeV cutoﬀ), which implies about 15%, globally averaged, in agreement with
the estimates given above. This change can be compared with the 10Be isotope record in
ice sheets. The inferred cosmic ray variation is plotted as a dashed line in Fig. 12 and the
long-term changes agrees well with the variation inferred from Fs.

If the cosmic-cloud link is real then this reduction of cosmic ray intensity implies
a net positive radiative forcing equivalent to about one solar cycle, i.e. +1.2 Wm−2
(Section 2.6) over the past century. In short, a systematic decrease in the cosmic ray ﬂux of
the magnitude indicated by the 10Be and coronal magnetic ﬂux measurements could have
caused a reduction in cloud cover and consequent warming of the Earth comparable to the
observed rise of 0.6◦C in global temperatures last century, which is presently attributed
predominantly to anthropogenic greenhouse gases.

2.7.2 Climate change over the last millennium

The observations of a correlation between the Sun’s activity, cosmic rays and the Earth’s
climate can be extended to earlier times with either 10Be or 14C data. The latter agree

50 years in the 14C data due to the

By analysing the 14C content in the rings of long-lived trees such the Californian
bristlecone pine, a year-by-year record has been assembled of the cosmic ray ﬂux on
Earth over the past several thousand years. The data for the last 1000 years are shown
in Fig. 13 [39]. The periods where the 14C deviation approaches or exceeds 10 parts
per mil correspond to recorded climatic anomalies: a) 1000–1270, the so-called Medieval
Warm period, b) 1280–1350, the Wolf minimum, c) 1420–1540, the Sp¨orer minimum,
and d) 1645–1715, the Maunder minimum. The warm period that lasted until about 1300
enabled the Vikings to colonise Greenland and wine making to ﬂourish in England. It was
followed by a period of about 500 years during which—save for a few short interruptions—
the glaciers advanced and a cooler, harsher climate predominated.

The Maunder Minimum, when there was an almost complete absence of sunspots, cor-
responded to a high cosmic ray ﬂux on Earth and therefore, under the present hypothesis,
to an increased cloudiness. This provides a consistent explanation for the exceptionally
cold weather during this period. Indeed, in every case the lack (a) or excess (b–d) of 14C
is consistent with the hypothesis of a higher cosmic ray ﬂux leading to more clouds and
cooler temperatures, and vice versa.

Evidence has recently been presented that this climate pattern extended into the
equatorial regions, and is therefore likely to have been a global phenomenon. Figure 14
shows the correlation of the 14C record with the depth and salinity of a lake in equatorial
East Africa over the last 1100 years [40]. The reconstruction is based on three indepen-

anomalies associated with the Medieval Warm period and the Wolf, Sp¨orer and Maunder
minima but also identify three extended drought periods between the minima: AD 1390–
1420, 1560–1625 and 1760–1840. The agreement with the 14C record is striking. The
cultural history of the region, recorded in documents and oral tradition, coincides with
the experimental data (see Fig. 14). In the present hypothesis, the periods of high cosmic
ray ﬂux would have corresponded to increased cloudiness. Under the assumption that in-
creased cloudiness implies increased cloud lifetime, the rainfall would have decreased but
at the same time the evaporative losses would have decreased. Which of these opposing
eﬀects would dominate depends on latitude and other regional eﬀects.

These and earlier historical examples of climate anomalies provide strong evidence
for solar variability and its coupling with the climate. One possible interpretation of the
14C data is that they provide a proxy for changes in the solar irradiance, and that this
was the actual cause of the climate change. The alternative possibility is the mechanism

19

addressed in this proposal, namely that the coupling is through the solar wind, cosmic
rays and clouds. Regardless of the mechanism, however, there is little doubt that the
Earth has experienced several extended warm and cold spells over the last 1000 years—
and indeed at earlier times—with climate swings comparable to the recent warming but
which could not be due to anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Whatever mechanism caused
those earlier changes in the climate could perhaps be at work today.

In summary, there are two main conclusions to be drawn from the historical record of
cosmic rays and climate change. Firstly, the pattern of systematic change in the global
climate over recorded history seems to follow the observed changes of cosmic ray ﬂux;
and it is consistent with the explanation that a low cosmic ray ﬂux corresponds to fewer
clouds and a warmer climate, and vice versa. Secondly, there has been a systematic
decrease of the cosmic ray ﬂux by about 15% over the course of the last century, caused
by a doubling of the solar coronal source magnetic ﬂux. The rise of about 0.6◦C in global
temperatures over the last 100 years is consistent in magnitude and time dependence
with the observed changes in cosmic ray ﬂux—and thereby cloud cover—over the same
period. If the cosmic-cloud link is conﬁrmed then it provides a new mechanism for climate
change that may signiﬁcantly revise the estimated contribution to global warming from
anthropogenic greenhouse gases. A clear and compelling case exists to investigate the
causal link between cosmic rays and clouds.

3 Goals of the CLOUD experiment

3.1 Scientiﬁc goals

The primary scientiﬁc goals of the CLOUD experiment are as follows:

1. To study the link between cosmic rays and the formation of large ions, aerosol par-

ticles, cloud droplets, and ice crystals.

2. To understand the microphysical mechanisms connecting cosmic rays to changes in

aerosol and cloud particle properties.

3. To simulate the eﬀects of cosmic rays on aerosol and cloud properties under atmo-

spheric conditions.

Concerning the last item, particular care will be taken to assess whether cosmic ray
variations could have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on cloud properties within the natural variabil-
ity of other factors. Where signiﬁcant eﬀects are found, we will attempt to provide the
climate modelling community with simpliﬁed parameterisations of changes in key prop-
erties of individual clouds. This will enable the inﬂuence of cosmic rays on clouds to be
incorporated into GCMs (general circulation models) and an evaluation made of their
contribution to the global radiative forcing over the last century (see Fig. 1).

3.2 Paths connecting cosmic rays and clouds

Atmospheric clouds are highly complex and can be aﬀected by a wide range of environ-
mental parameters. At the simplest level, the development of a single small cumulus cloud
is inﬂuenced by small changes in the temperature structure of the atmosphere, changes
in humidity and surface heating rate. At a more complex level, the number of cloud
droplets that form and their size distribution are aﬀected by the composition and sizes of
the aerosol particles upon which the water vapour condenses (Appendix A). There is also
an enormous variety of cloud types, whose properties depend on the speciﬁc environmental
conditions under which they form and develop.

This complexity makes it diﬃcult to make a straightforward connection between cos-

mic ray ﬂux and cloud behaviour. Our approach in the CLOUD experiment is to:

1. Identify a number of key aerosol and cloud properties that might be aﬀected by

21

cosmic rays.

cesses.

2. Experimentally determine the eﬀects of cosmic rays under constrained laboratory

conditions relevant to the atmosphere.

3. Incorporate the experimental results in computer models of aerosol and cloud pro-

4. Simulate the behaviour of natural clouds with a variable cosmic ray rate to determine

which cloud properties are sensitive to these variations.

If cosmic rays can inﬂuence clouds, it is likely to be through their eﬀects on aerosols or
on ice nucleation. Aerosols are found throughout the atmosphere and constitute eﬃcient
cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) for activation of cloud droplets (Appendix A). The
presence of a largely abundant supply of CCN ensures that the maximum water vapour
supersaturations in the atmosphere rarely exceed values of about 1% since higher values
are arrested by the removal of water vapour during droplet growth.

We have identiﬁed four distinct ways in which cosmic ray ionisation could, either
directly or indirectly, aﬀect clouds in the troposphere. The mechanisms are summarised
in Fig. 15 and described individually in Sections 3.2.1–3.2.4 below. It is also possible that
cosmic rays inﬂuence aerosol processes in the stratosphere, as discussed in Section 3.2.5.

3.2.1 Enhanced aerosol nucleation and growth into cloud condensation nuclei

Cosmic rays create ions in the troposphere, which may aﬀect aerosol microphysical pro-
cesses. Figure 16 shows a simpliﬁed set of atmospheric pathways that might connect
variations of atmospheric ionisation with changes in the CCN abundance. The unbroken
arrows indicate processes that are known to occur in the atmosphere. The arrows labelled
‘GCR’ are processes whose rate may be aﬀected by ionisation. The most important pro-
cesses aﬀected are likely to be aerosol nucleation and aerosol particle growth either by
condensation or by coagulation.9 Clouds that form in air containing high CCN concen-
trations tend to have high droplet concentrations, which enhances the shortwave (solar)
albedo. Increase in the CCN concentration also inhibits rainfall and therefore increases
cloud lifetimes (cloud coverage). These eﬀects—which are due to more, smaller droplets
at a ﬁxed liquid water content—are particularly signiﬁcant in marine air, where the CCN
concentrations are generally quite low.

The possible cosmic ray inﬂuence on CCN abundance indicated in Fig. 16 is similar
to, but not the same as, the so-called aerosol indirect eﬀect on clouds and climate. The
aerosol indirect eﬀect concerns changes in the supply of the aerosol material (such as SO2
in Fig. 16), which subsequently causes a change in the CCN abundance and hence cloud
droplet concentrations. In the cosmic ray–aerosol–cloud indirect eﬀect, which we propose
to study, the cause of a change in CCN abundance would be changes in the rates of certain
aerosol transformation processes.

It has been long speculated that atmospheric sulphate particles are formed by ion-
induced nucleation (see, for example, refs. [41, 42] and references quoted therein). Also,

9Nucleation refers to the creation from vapours of a small (

1 nm diameter), stable molecular cluster
(aerosol) of a few tens or hundreds of molecules. Coagulation is the growth of an aerosol population by
particles colliding and sticking together.

Figure 16: Possible inﬂuence of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) on the nucleation of new
condensation nuclei (CN) and on the growth into cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), ul-
timately causing an increase in the concentration of cloud droplets. The arrows labelled
‘GCR’ are processes whose rate may be aﬀected by cosmic rays. Dimethyl sulphide (DMS)
from plankton is the major source of sulphur dioxide—the precursor of sulphuric acid—in
remote marine environments.

processes such as ion-ion recombination have been proposed which lead to the production
of stable molecular clusters in the lower stratosphere [43] and in the troposphere [4, 5].
Since the nucleation rate of new aerosols from these processes is proportional to ion
concentration, variations of the cosmic ray ﬂux may translate into variations of aerosol
particle concentrations and, ultimately, CCN concentrations. Recent experimental data
suggest that ions may indeed be involved in gas-to-particle conversion. H˜orrak et al. [44]
reported the spontaneous formation of bursts of intermediate size ions in urban air, which
they suggest may be due to ion-induced nucleation. The Helsinki group has made similar
observations of aerosol bursts in unpolluted marine air [45] and in remote continental air
[46].

Although the ion-induced nucleation phenomenon has been studied for more than 100
years, it remains poorly understood, both experimentally and theoretically. For example,
the classical theory describes the charge eﬀect on nucleation by an electrostatic interaction
term between the ion and condensing molecules. However, this term does not explain the
ion sign preference exhibited by many molecules (e.g. water molecules nucleate more easily
on negative ions) which was experimentally found already by Wilson in 1899 [47]. The
sign preference has been attributed to surface orientation of dipolar molecules [48, 49],
and a partial theoretical understanding has been proposed [50].

There is new evidence that increases in CCN concentration can indeed suppress rain-
fall, and hence increase cloud lifetime. A recent study [51] used NOAA satellite data
to investigate clouds that formed downwind of industrial sites located in pristine areas.

23

The otherwise uniform cloud data from these regions was streaked with bright (highly
reﬂective) plumes from the industrial sites. The droplets in these plumes were found to
be more numerous than the nearby regions and of a smaller diameter—typically less than
10µm and therefore below the threshold size for them to coalesce eﬃciently and precipi-
tate. In contrast the droplets outside the plumes measured more than 25 µm in diameter.
The high reﬂectivity of the plumes resulted from the high droplet number density at ﬁxed
liquid water content (Fig. 47). Independent analysis of data from the Tropical Rainfall
Measuring Mission conﬁrmed that these plumes did indeed produce less rain and there-
fore had a longer lifetime than clouds in the nearby regions. These observations suggest
that, if increases in cosmic ray ﬂux could be translated into increases in CCN abundance,
the observed increases in cloudiness (Fig. 7) could be due to decreases in precipitation
eﬃciency.

3.2.2 Enhanced cloud condensation nucleus activation by charge attachment

Aerosol activation is the rapid growth of an existing aerosol into a large (>
1 µm) liquid
∼
droplet by condensation of water from a supersaturated vapour. If aerosol charging (in-
duced by cosmic ionisation) could decrease the supersaturation needed for activation, this
would lead to an increase in droplet number densities in clouds, with consequences for all
cloud microphysical processes.

∼

The possible eﬀect of charges on aerosol activation has usually been ignored since the
conventional electrostatic interaction term is expected to be appreciable only for very
small aerosols of
1 nm diameter for small charges (see Appendix C). However, a recent
study [52] on heterogeneous nucleation of n-butanol vapour on charged and uncharged
insoluble particles shows a surprisingly large charge eﬀect. The charges have a clear eﬀect
on the nucleation process even when the seed particles are as large as 90 nm in diameter
and the supersaturation is only 0.5%. For these experiments the classical theory predicts
that the diﬀerence in the nucleating ability of charged and uncharged seed particles should
vanish for particle diameters above 20 nm, corresponding to supersaturations of about
100%. If this result is correct, it indicates that charges may play a role in atmospheric
cloud drop activation processes, at least when the CCN are partially insoluble (e.g. carbon)
and carry multiple charges. Furthermore, the charges could inﬂuence the condensation
of low vapour pressure trace gases on aerosol particles, and thereby aﬀect the processes
transforming CN into CCN.

3.2.3 Formation of condensable vapours and the eﬀect on cloud condensation

nuclei

The ions and radicals, together with trace atmospheric gases, may promote the formation
of condensable vapours or enhance the condensation of vapours already present, which
can lead to the growth of existing aerosols (Appendix B). The condensation may occur on
unactivated aerosols or on cloud droplets (aqueous phase growth), which would result in
larger aerosol mass after evaporation of the water. Growth of aerosols can lead to a higher
CCN number concentration, and to CCN that activate into droplets at lower supersatura-
tions. The free radicals created by cosmic rays may also be able to inﬂuence atmospheric
chemistry under certain conditions, especially if catalytic reactions are involved or where
cosmic rays constitute a signiﬁcant source of a chemical species [53, 54].

24

The most important radicals created by cosmic rays are N, O, and OH from the
dissociation of the primary active constituents of air: N2, O2 and H2O. The estimated
production rates are about 1–2 hydroxyl (OH) molecules per ion-pair [53] and 1.5 nitric
oxide (NO) molecules per ion-pair [55, 56, 57]. These rates imply mixing ratios of about
0.7 pptv NO are generated per day by cosmic rays directly in the upper troposphere.
After oxidation to nitric acid this may aﬀect the growth of both CN and CCN (Fig. 17).

Figure 17: Possible inﬂuence of galactic cosmic rays on the production of new condensable
vapours and subsequent growth of existing CN and CCN.

Although the production of NO by cosmic rays is small on a global basis, it may be
the dominant source in the upper troposphere of remote regions [55, 56]. Experimental
evidence for the importance of particle ionising radiation for NO production is demon-
strated by a clear nitrate signal in the Greenland ice core associated with solar proton
events and the solar cycle [58, 59]. Calculations indicate that galactic cosmic rays may be
responsible for about half of the NO in the polar stratosphere, and may be the dominant
source during the polar winters when N2O oxidation is suppressed [54, 56].

3.2.4 Creation of ice nuclei

The presence of ice in clouds has an important inﬂuence on their radiative properties
and it can also lead to precipitation. However the apparent lack of ice nuclei (IN) in the
atmosphere is at present a mystery: there is about 1 IN per litre at 253 K (compared with
about 106 aerosol particles per litre) whereas the observed concentrations of ice particles in
clouds at these temperatures vary between 10 and 300 per litre. Two nucleation processes
can lead to ice formation: a) direct sublimation of vapour to the solid phase (deposition
nucleation) and b) freezing of a liquid droplet (freezing nucleation). It has been suggested
that the ionisation produced by cosmic rays may be able to aﬀect both deposition and
freezing nucleation (Fig. 18).

The possible eﬀect of charges on ice nucleation has been studied to some extent (see
Pruppacher and Klett [60] for a review), and eﬀects have been seen in a number of
experiments. Especially, the ice nucleating ability of various types of seed particles seems

25

Figure 18: Possible inﬂuence of galactic cosmic rays on the creation of ice nuclei (IN) and
ice particles at temperatures below 273 K.

to be inﬂuenced by ionisation. It is interesting to note that cloud chamber experiments
at the University of Missouri-Rolla in 1980 [61] found an enhancement of frozen droplets
in the regions where cosmic rays traversed the cloud chamber (Fig. 19)—although it was
not possible to determine if the cosmic rays preceded or followed the droplet formation.
The presence of ions was observed to raise the threshold temperature for homogeneous
ice nucleation by about 2 K.

Enhancing heterogeneous ice nucleation by electriﬁcation has been proposed by several
workers in the context of solar-terrestrial climate connections. It is supported by very little
experimental work so far [60]. If the electrofreezing eﬀect [7] is real, possible inﬂuences
of cosmic rays on cirrus formation and on the properties of middle clouds are implied.
Electrofreezing could also aﬀect glaciation (which triggers rain) in convective clouds. This
may in some way be related to the correlation between cosmic rays and precipitation [26].

3.2.5 The eﬀect of cosmic rays on stratospheric clouds and ozone depletion

The previous four processes have concerned aerosols and clouds in the troposphere. How-
ever, cosmic ray intensities are even higher in the stratosphere, so it is conceivable that
they also have an inﬂuence on aerosol processes in that part of the atmosphere [62].

Chemical reactions on stratospheric aerosols are a prerequisite for seasonal ozone deple-
tion in both the Arctic and Antarctic stratosphere [63]. These reactions convert relatively
inert inorganic chlorine compounds into photochemically labile forms that can enter into
ozone-destroying gas-phase catalytic cycles. The formation of polar stratospheric clouds
in the low temperature polar stratosphere dramatically accelerates the rate of these reac-
tions, leading to the formation of the ozone hole.

Signiﬁcant advances have been made in our understanding of polar stratospheric cloud
formation in the last 10–15 years [64, 65]. However, there remain important uncertainties
that prevent a reliable prognosis of ozone depletion rates in a given winter or in future
years. Chief among these uncertainties is what controls the phase (liquid or solid) of polar
stratospheric cloud particles. At temperatures above the ice frost point the particles may

be either liquid solutions of nitric acid, sulphuric acid and water or else solid hydrates of
nitric acid. The formation of solid hydrates is important because it allows the selective
growth of a small number of particles that subsequently become large enough to sediment
out of the stratosphere. This process leads to denitriﬁcation of the polar stratosphere and
often to strongly enhanced ozone loss (see ref. [66] and and references therein).

Several mechanisms are recognised to be important for the formation of solid polar
stratospheric clouds particles [64, 67]. However, persistent and optically very thin clouds,
often seen over several thousand kilometer regions cannot be explained by any recognised
mechanism. These tenuous hydrate clouds appear to be formed by a mechanism that
operates on a very large scale with little spatial variability, thus excluding formation
mechanisms involving localised cooling [68]. Laboratory experiments also exclude the
possibility that these solid particles form by crystallisation of the liquid aerosols [69] by
large scale cooling. An intriguing possibility—so far unexplored—is that these clouds
form by deposition nucleation of nitric acid and water directly on cosmic ray-generated
ions or ion clusters. However, to date, there have been no experiments that can conﬁrm
or dispute this possibility. An understanding of such particles appears to be critical to a
complete understanding of denitriﬁcation and ozone loss.

27

3.3 Experimental concept

The essential approach of CLOUD is to test the link between cosmic rays and cloud
formation under controlled laboratory conditions in a particle beam, which provides an
adjustable and collimated source of “cosmic rays”. The detector is based on an expansion
cloud chamber that is designed to duplicate atmospheric conditions. This requires the
capability of producing the very low water vapour supersaturations10—typically a few
tenths of a percent—found in clouds, so that the precise cloud-forming properties of the
air parcel under study can be measured.

The advantage of this approach is that all the experimental conditions can be pre-

beam intensities from zero up to high values, we can determine if there is a causal rela-
tionship between ionising radiation and cloud formation. Such measurements are diﬃcult
to perform with cosmic rays in the atmosphere since the natural intensity variations are
modest and they follow the slow 11-year solar cycle. Furthermore, the CLOUD experi-
ment provides full control of the initial gas mixture and aerosol content and, in addition,
complete physical and chemical analysis of the ﬁnal products after beam exposure. This
will greatly facilitate an understanding of the microphysics and chemistry of any observed
eﬀects. The challenges of the laboratory-based approach are to precisely duplicate the
atmospheric conditions and to ensure that the ﬁnite volume (walls) of the cloud chamber
does not aﬀect the measurements.

Surprisingly, cloud chamber data under atmospheric conditions in a particle beam have
never been previously obtained. C.T.R. Wilson’s cloud chamber11 [70, 71] was extensively
used for experimental particle physics in the ﬁrst half of the 20th century, but was mostly
operated under conditions far removed from those of the atmosphere. In order to grow
droplets on the small ions produced by ionising radiation, Wilson cloud chambers were
operated with water vapour supersaturations of 500–600%, to be compared with maximum
values of about 1% in atmospheric clouds (see Appendices A and C). However, it is
interesting to note observations made in cloud chambers in the 1960’s of backgrounds due
to “hypersensitive condensation nuclei” [72]. These activated into droplets at very low
water vapour supersaturations—of order 1%—and were attributed to trace amounts of
NO2 vapour created by electrostatic discharges.

3.4

Initial experimental programme

The initial CLOUD experimental programme and operating conditions are summarised
in Table 3. It is important to note that our experimental search is quite broad since at

1, where S is the saturation ratio, p is the

ambient partial pressure of water vapour and p0 is the saturated vapour pressure over a plane surface of
water at this temperature. Supersaturation is frequently expressed as a percentage.

11Wilson had the inspiration for the cloud chamber while observing meteorological phenomena on the
mountain of Ben Nevis in 1894. The phenomena were not particle tracks, however, but “coronas” around
the Sun and glories, where the Sun glows around shadows in the mist. He developed the cloud chamber
to try to reproduce these eﬀects in the laboratory. Although his expansion cloud chamber was crucial
to the development of nuclear and particle physics for the next half century and earned him the 1927
Nobel Prize in Physics, Wilson remained fascinated by atmospheric phenomena throughout his life [71].
Indeed, he devoted a large part of his later research life to seeking a connection between cosmic rays and
clouds. We are therefore glad to propose a Wilson cloud chamber for this experiment.

present there is no clear microphysical explanation of the possible cosmic-cloud link. We
therefore expect to adapt our investigations according to our experimental observations
and to the current experimental and theoretical developments at the time of taking data.
The initial experimental programme described here should therefore be considered as
representative rather than deﬁnitive.

Each experiment will in general be performed with two diﬀerent carrier gases: a) pure
Ar (inert carrier), b) pure artiﬁcial air (80% N2, 20% 02). The cloud-forming properties
and other physical and chemical characteristics of the aerosols will be measured under
beam/no-beam conditions using a range of equipment described in Section 4.

In the following subsections we outline some of the experiments required to explore

the mechanisms described in Sections 3.2.1–3.2.5.

3.4.1 Aerosol nucleation and growth experiments

These studies concern the formation of aerosols from the vapour phase, via ion-induced
nucleation, and their subsequent growth by vapour condensation and coagulation.

We will investigate the clustering of trace gas molecules onto ions. The trace gas
molecules will either be formed by the ionising particle beam in pure artiﬁcial air or be
introduced directly into the chamber. Such trace gas molecules include, in particular,
H2O, H2SO4, HNO3, NH3 and certain volatile organic compounds. These trace gases
will be measured by CIMS (Chemical Ionisation Mass Spectrometry), and the ions will
be measured by ion mass spectrometers and ion mobility analysers. During activation
measurements in the cloud chamber a fairly high supersaturation (large expansion) will
be required, depending on the size and nature of the nucleated aerosols.

A major goal of these studies is to ﬁnd out what fraction of the small ions created by
ionising radiation become stable aerosol particles. This fraction f will increase with
decreasing temperature T and with increasing abundance of the clustering trace gas
molecules. For example, in the case of H2SO4/H2O ion clusters, f is expected to in-
crease with increasing relative humidity and relative acidity. However, for low H2SO4
concentrations a kinetic limitation becomes important which is related to the limited ion-
ion recombination lifetime tIR. It is therefore important to work under well-controlled
conditions with respect to the total ion concentrations ni and thereby tIR on the one hand
and the sulphuric acid concentration [H2SO4] on the other. Both ni and [H2SO4], along
with [H2O] and T , must be precisely known and adjustable.

The link proposed in section 3.2.1 between aerosols and clouds includes also a charge-
enhanced growth of aerosols from small size (Aitken mode, 20–100 nm diameter) into
the cloud-condensation nuclei (CCN) mode (>
100 nm) where they can eﬃciently activate
∼
to form cloud droplets. We will start with a study of aerosols that are common in the
atmosphere and known to be important in cloud formation such as NaCl, (NH4)2SO4
and H2SO4. Both “dry” and aqueous-phase growth will be studied. We will begin with
well-known, simple systems to ﬁrst conﬁrm that the apparatus is well understood. This
involves measurements with monodisperse NaCl or (NH4)2SO4 aerosols of diameter 10 nm,
followed by 20 nm and then 40 nm. Then a second or third vapour component will be
added and more complex systems studied.

Comparisons will be made with and without beam. Since diﬀusion of small ions is sig-
niﬁcant for beam exposures longer than about a minute (Section 5.4.3), the with/without

30

beam measurements will be made in separate runs. Because of their relatively small
mobility, the loss of aerosol particles to the walls of the cloud chamber is rather slow
(Section 5.4.2) and, depending on the speciﬁc conditions, growth processes lasting 1–10
hours or more can be studied.

We will also investigate aqueous phase growth by taking measurements with several
activation ⇀↽ evaporation (expansion ⇀↽ compression) cycles. The possibility that negative
ions cause faster growth and condensation rates than positive ions will be investigated by
selecting the ion charges with the ﬁeld-cage of the cloud chamber (Section 5.3).

3.4.2 Cloud condensation nuclei activation experiments

These studies concern the growth of aerosols into cloud droplets at relative humidities
greater than 100%. Such aerosols, known as cloud condensation nuclei, have typical
sizes in the atmosphere of 50-100 µm. Aerosols of a well deﬁned size and with typical
atmospheric composition (NaCl, (NH4)2SO4, H2SO4) can be produced with standard
aerosol generation techniques (Section 4.4.3). Experiments will be performed to examine
the activation of these aerosols into cloud droplets. The cooling of the cloud chamber by
expansion will be suﬃciently precise to be able to induce supersaturations with respect to
water that are typical of the full range of values observed in natural clouds (Section 4.1).
Experiments with and without beam will enable the eﬀect of aerosol charging on
activation to be investigated. The charge distribution on the aerosols will be measured
using a uniform electric ﬁeld created by a ﬁeld cage.
In particular, we wish to know
whether aerosol charging can reduce the critical supersaturation required to activate an
aerosol particle into a water droplet. This can be investigated by counting the number of
activated droplets as the supersaturation is gradually increased in separate experiments.

3.4.3 Condensable vapour formation experiments

These experiments will ﬁrst quantify the poorly-known production rates of a) nitric oxide
(NO) and b) hydroxyl radicals (OH) by cosmic radiation. The former will involve pure
artiﬁcial air and the latter will involve argon and water vapour. Subsequently we will
investigate the eﬀects of these vapours on the nucleation and growth of aerosols.

3.4.4 Ice nuclei formation experiments

These studies concern the formation of ice nuclei in supercooled vapours at low temper-
atures. The expansion chamber will be used to create a supercooled cloud by expansion
and growth of drops at temperatures below 260 K. The temperature of the drops can be
controlled by the initial temperature of the chamber before expansion. The beam will be
pulsed through the supercooled cloud and data recorded. The presence of an ice crystal
in a cloud of drops is easily identiﬁed since an ice crystal scatters much more light than
a water drop (Fig. 19) [61]. The charge distribution on the ice nuclei will be measured
using a uniform electric ﬁeld created by the ﬁeld cage. In addition to experiments with
supercooled liquid droplets already present (freezing nucleation), we will also investigate
ice nucleation without pre-existing droplets (deposition nucleation).

31

3.4.5 Stratospheric cloud formation experiments

These experiments concern the deposition nucleation of nitric acid and water vapours
onto ion clusters to form nitric acid hydrates. Particles composed of such hydrates are
thought to be the principal component of the polar stratospheric clouds that initiate the
destruction of ozone.

The temperature of the cloud chamber will be reduced to typical polar stratospheric
values of between 190 and 200 K. Nitric acid and water vapour will be introduced into
the chamber at partial pressures representative of the stratosphere (10−4 Pa for nitric
10−2 Pa for water vapour). At these pressures and temperatures
acid vapour and 5
the nitric acid hydrates become supersaturated and can condense as crystals provided a
suitable nucleus is present. We seek to establish whether ion clusters can serve as these
nuclei just as they can for the formation of sulphuric acid droplets in the stratosphere [3].
A background air mixture composed of water, nitric acid and sulphuric acid vapours will
be used to represent the species most likely to contribute to initial ion cluster formation.

4.1 Design considerations

Choice of expansion cloud chamber: The expansion cloud chamber has several im-
portant advantages over other nucleation devices12 for the studies proposed here. In par-
ticular, previous measurements with expansion chambers by our collaboration (Helsinki,
Missouri-Rolla, and Vienna) have veriﬁed that the thermodynamic conditions after an
expansion are precisely known and reproducible, provided that the initial conditions are
well-known and the expansion ratio (pressure change) is well-measured. Moreover the
expansion chamber can provide a large volume with uniform thermodynamic conditions
where, for example, relatively slow processes can be measured. Expansion chambers may
in fact be the only devices that can achieve the necessary thermodynamic stability and
precision to study aerosol activation in the laboratory at the very small water vapour
supersaturations (few
0.1%) found in clouds and, in addition, cover the full range of
supersaturations up to those required to activate small ions and nanometre-sized aerosols.

×

∼

Size of cloud chamber: A large cloud chamber (
50 cm diameter) achieves the longest
time of known thermodynamic conditions in the ﬁducial volume13 of the chamber. The
sensitive time14 ranges from about a second for expansions that produce high enough su-
persaturations in water vapour to activate ions (a large diﬀerence in temperature between
the walls and the gas) to several tens or even hundreds of seconds for the activation and
growth of large aerosols (a small diﬀerence in temperature) (Section 5.2). The sensitive
12Besides the expansion cloud chamber, other experimental devices for studying nucleation include
the thermal diﬀusion cloud chamber, cooled-wall expansion chamber, shock tubes and turbulent mixing
chambers.

13The ﬁducial volume is the central region of the chamber where the thermodynamic and other condi-

tions are well known, and where the measurements are made.

14The sensitive time following an expansion refers to the period during which no signiﬁcant changes of
thermodynamic conditions occur in the central part of the chamber caused by the heating inﬂuences of
the walls.

32

time of an expansion chamber increases steeply with its size since it is proportional to
the square of the ratio of the volume to wall area, which re-heats the gas following an
adiabatic expansion. In addition a chamber size of about 50 cm ensures that diﬀusion
losses of the aerosols to the walls are not signiﬁcant for measurements lasting up to several
hours with a single ﬁll (see Section 5.4.2).

SS <
∼

Water vapour supersaturation: The cloud chamber is required to operate at water
vapour supersaturations (SS) from below zero (unsaturated) up to about 700%. An
important requirement is to provide precise simulation of the conditions found in clouds,
for which 0.1% <
1% (Appendix A). This supersaturation range corresponds
∼
to a broad activation range of aerosols, namely radii from about 1 µm (at 0.1% SS)
down to about 50 nm (at 1% SS). In order to probe the aerosol size distribution with
suﬃcient resolution, the chamber needs to achieve a SS precision after expansion of
about 0.1% in the range 0 < SS < 1%. Furthermore, the cloud chamber also needs to
measure condensation nuclei down to small ion dimensions (0.2 nm), which requires large
expansions producing supersaturations of up to 500%. The precision of the large SS
values is, however, less demanding than for the small values.

Expansion time: The time duration of the expansion pulse needs to be short compared
with the droplet growth time so that the start time is the same for all activated aerosols.
This is especially important for experiments involving a broad size distribution of aerosols
(to represent atmospheric aerosols), which activate over a relatively wide range of super-
saturations. A rapid expansion ensures that the larger aerosols do not deplete the water
vapour and prevent activation of the smaller aerosols. In practise the fastest required ex-
pansion time is about 200 ms. For comparison, the expansion time for the 25 cm Vienna
chamber is 20-30 ms and, for the 38 cm Missouri-Rolla chamber, it is 200 ms.

Temperature and pressure operating range: The cloud chamber is required to
operate over the full range of temperatures and pressures encountered by clouds in the
troposphere and stratosphere, namely 173 K < T < 293 K and 0 < P < 101 kPa. The
maximum pressure of the chamber is actually 150 kPa, in order to allow measurements
to be made at 1 atm following a large expansion. It is important to note that the full
range of pressure change can be addressed with our chamber design (Section 4.2.2). In a
typical expansion chamber the pressure of the gas in the sensitive volume is used to drive
the piston. For low pressures this becomes ineﬀective. In the cloud chamber proposed
here, the piston is moved by a hydraulic system and thus a fast and precise expansion
and re-compression can be achieved regardless of the pressure change in the chamber.

Temperature and pressure stability: The requirement of a precision of 0.1% on
the supersaturation places demanding requirements on the temperature control of the
cloud chamber. Taking a design value for the supersaturation error of one half this value,
i.e. 0.05%, implies the need for a temperature stability ∆T = 0.01 K and a pressure
10−4 (see
stability ∆P/P = 1.3
Section 5.1, Eq. 6). Note that these are stability requirements; the absolute precisions of
the temperature and pressure are less demanding.

10−4 or, equivalently, a volume stability ∆V /V = 0.9

4.2 Cloud chamber

4.2.1 Overview

×

The CLOUD detector is shown in Figs. 20 and 21. The active volume is a cylinder of
dimensions 50 cm (height)
50 cm (diameter) and the ﬁducial volume is the central
region of linear dimensions about 10–20 cm. The chamber is completely surrounded by
a liquid bath which maintains precise temperature control. An outer vacuum enclosure,
together with super insulation, maintains the thermal insulation of the inner detector.
The cloud chamber volume is equipped with an electrode structure (ﬁeld cage) to provide
a clearing ﬁeld or the possibility to drift and measure charged aerosols. It also allows a
method to select positive or negative charges for separate study.

Expansions are made by two techniques: a piston and a buﬀer expansion tank. The
former is operated by a hydraulic system similar in design to the Big European Bubble
Chamber (BEBC). The buﬀer expansion tank involves an external tank with a volume
ten times larger than that of the cloud chamber. Expansions are eﬀected by ﬁrst reducing
the pressure in the external tank to the desired value and then opening fast-acting valves
connecting the external tank to the cloud chamber.

∼

The optical readout of the cloud chamber comprises two systems: a) a constant angle
Mie scattering (CAMS) detector and b) a stereo pair of CCD cameras. The two sys-
tems are complementary but, nevertheless, have a broad region of overlap where they can
provide mutual cross-checks. The CAMS system can measure very high droplet num-
10–107 cm−3) whereas the CCD cameras operate best in a lower range
ber densities (
0.1–105 cm−3). The CAMS system provides a high-resolution measurement of mean
(
∼
droplet radii vs. time, whereas the CCD cameras provide a measurement of droplet size
in coarser time intervals, using pulse height information. Finally, the CAMS detector
integrates over all illuminated droplets whereas the CCD cameras reconstruct the 3-
dimensional spatial positions of individual droplets, and tracks their movements. This
is important for identifying ice nuclei (Section 3.4.4) and for measuring droplet drift ve-
locities (large droplet sizes).

The illumination system comprises: a) a laser for illumination of a narrow region for
the CAMS detector (and, in parallel, for the CCD cameras) and b) a xenon ﬂash tube
for the CCD cameras, mounted at the top window (an auxiliary xenon ﬂash system is
also mounted close to the CCD cameras). A video camera is also mounted at the top
window in order to provide a visual inspection of the chamber volume and piston surface.
The video camera and xenon illumination share the same window by means of a partially
reﬂecting mirror (Fig. 20). The side windows are designed to allow simultaneous viewing
of both the beam- and no-beam regions of the chamber. All windows are made of optical
quality quartz. The use of quartz allows for the possibility of including UV irradiation to
investigate reactions involving photochemical processes.

Cleaning of the chamber is very important to ensure reliable results. The upper
window is designed to be removable to allow cleaning access to the inside of the chamber
and to minimise the transition time between diﬀerent chamber ﬁlls. The chamber is also
cleanable by vacuum baking. Vacuum evacuation is also an eﬀective and rapid technique
for removing a gas/aerosol mixture before reﬁlling. Finally, large chamber expansions
with a pure carrier gas can be used to conﬁrm the cleanliness of the chamber before ﬁlling
with a new mixture. Indeed, droplet activation and sedimentation is a proven technique

36

to clean the cloud chamber to ultra low levels of contamination.

The chamber is equipped with two sampling probes. These provide the possibility
of extracting gas and aerosols from the ﬁducial region of the cloud chamber. They also
provide the possibility for special measurements such as, for example, injection of a special
gas into a limited region at the centre of the chamber. The probe tubes are straight and
have a large diameter inner bore. All valves and pipes leading to and from the chamber are
designed to provide eﬃcient transmission of aerosols (large diameters and gentle curves).

assembly and exposed to the same beam as the cloud chamber. It provides the source for
external measurements of the physical and chemical properties of the trace gases, aerosols
and ions with mass spectrometers, ion detectors, condensation particle counters (CPC)
and diﬀerential mobility particle sizers (DMPS).

4.2.2 Expansion techniques

The cloud chamber has a ﬂexible choice of expansion techniques and expansion/ re-
compression cycles. There are two expansion techniques (Fig. 22):

37

a) Piston: Piston movement involves active control of the piston connecting rod by
means of a hydraulic system similar in design to that used for the Big European Bubble
Chamber (BEBC). An important advantage of piston expansions is that they minimise the
gas turbulence, an eﬀect that becomes more signiﬁcant as the expansion ratio increases.
The piston also provides a ﬂexible choice of precise expansion and re-compression cycles,
with piston movements reproducible to very high precision—better than 5 µm. The
range of piston movement is 5 µm to 200 mm i.e. volume expansion ratios of between
10−5 and 0.4. The very small expansions will provide supersaturations characteristic of
those found in atmospheric clouds, while the largest expansions will activate aerosols of
molecular/small-ion dimensions. The largest expansions also provide an eﬀective method
to clean trace condensation impurities from the cloud chamber by activation and then
sedimentation.

∼

∼

b) External buﬀer tank: This is a second method to produce small expansions. It
involves a tank with a volume
10 times larger than the active volume of the cloud
1 m3. The tank is not cooled but has good thermal insulation to ensure
chamber, i.e.
that any temperature ﬂuctuations are slow over the period of a particular measurement.
It is directly connected to the active gas volume via synchronised fast-acting valves at
the top of the chamber. Expansions are eﬀected by ﬁrst achieving a pressure equilibrium
with the valves open, then closing the valves, reducing the pressure in the buﬀer tank by
the required (small) amount and ﬁnally re-opening the valves. The valves are left open
during the sensitive time of the cloud chamber. The piston remains in a ﬁxed location
throughout. An important advantage of this method is that it extends the sensitive
time since it provides passive compensation for the pressure rise following an adiabatic
expansion. The pressure rise occurs due to heating of the layer of gas near the walls and
it causes a temperature rise throughout the volume by an adiabatic re-compression of the
gas.

4.2.3 Operational experience with cloud chambers

Some operational experience of our collaboration with cloud expansion chambers is sum-
marised below:

1. Reproducibility: The expansion ratio is determined from the initial and ﬁnal pres-
sures, since these quantities can be measured precisely—better than 10−4 absolute.
Other quantities such as temperature change and supersaturation are calculated
from the pressure change and the known initial conditions. In the 38 cm Missouri-
Rolla chamber the pressure change is highly reproducible from pulse to pulse (a
10−4 for a large pressure change of 90 kPa).
spread of about 2

·

2. Cycle time: The 25 cm Vienna chamber requires about 1 hr between expansions to
allow time for thermodynamic equilibrium to be re-established. The 38 cm Rolla
chamber requires about 5 min for equilibrium to be re-established following a deep
expansion producing a temperature change ∆T = -40 K, during continual operation.
The cycle time is largely determined by how quickly the walls of the chamber can
be brought back to the operational temperature following an expansion cycle.

38

3. Conditioning time: The 25 cm Vienna chamber requires 1–2 days conditioning prior

to taking data.

4. Chamber cleaning: Based on 20 years experience with the operation of expansion
cloud chambers at Missouri-Rolla, the following technique will clean a cloud cham-
ber suﬃciently for the demanding requirements of homogeneous nucleation mea-
surements:

•

•

The chamber is ﬁrst fogged with liberal quantities of pure high quality water
to dilute and remove water soluble components,. A fog nozzle sprays water
drops over the chamber so that all surfaces are wetted and water runs down
the walls. (In the CLOUD chamber the water will be injected through the
sampling probe tubes.) After the application of about 4 litres, the water at the
bottom of the chamber is removed with a tube suction device. After about 3
applications, a vacuum is applied to remove residual water.

Acetone is then applied and is very eﬀective at removing the last traces of
water (particularly any water that has a surfactant preventing evaporation) as
well as traces of any hydrocarbons etc., for which it is an excellent solvent.
The acetone is removed from the bottom of the chamber and the remaining
(high vapour pressure) acetone is removed by vacuum evaporation.

•

Finally, the chamber is warmed under vacuum to remove the residual volatile
contamination.

4.2.4 Piston and hydraulic system

The piston expansion system comprises two main parts: the main piston and connecting
rod, and the hydraulic system (Fig. 22a). The latter is based on the same design as was
used to control the 2 m-diameter piston of BEBC [73].

The main piston head is made of a stainless steel envelope containing an inner stiﬀening
structure. The piston has several grooves for holding spring-loaded PTFE seals which
provide the gas seal with the walls of the cylinder. The upper surface of the piston is
light-absorbing to reduce reﬂections from the top-window illumination (Section 4.3.2).
The outer region of the upper surface of the piston is shaped to provide a ﬁlm of water for
establishing 100% relative humidity in the active chamber volume. The inner structure of
the piston is a sandwich assembly made of honeycomb and resin polymer plates reinforced
with carbon ﬁbre. This provides a good structural rigidity while maintaining a low mass.
A low mass is important since the required acceleration rates are large (up to 30 g) to
achieve a fast expansion time for piston strokes up to the maximum of 200 mm. The
main piston rod is made of stainless steel. The upper end of the rod is linked to the
piston through a kernel which is dismountable for assembly and maintenance purposes.
The lower end of the rod is ﬁtted with a hydraulic piston which is driven by the servo-
mechanism.

The servo-mechanism (Fig. 23) is made of several main components: a servovalve, a
hydraulic pump, and high pressure and low pressure accumulators [74]. There are three
circuits containing liquid hydraulic oil: high pressure circuit (220 bar), low pressure circuit
(20 bar), and the control circuit (running at a nominal pressure of 160 bar). All circuits

are supplied by a hydraulic pump delivering an outlet pressure of 350 bar and a nominal
ﬂow rate of 20 l/min for a rotation speed of 1500 rpm. The power consumption is about
26 kW. The high pressure circuit feeds the high pressure accumulator (10 l capacity),
which serves as an energy tank for the expansion. A low pressure accumulator (which is
normally not present in these systems) is also included to avoid any shocks in the circuits
or back eﬀects at the end of the piston travel. Each of the circuits is equipped with
pressure relief valves, with recuperation into a 100 l tank, and ﬂow rate regulating valves.
The control circuit drives the most critical component of the hydraulic system: the
10 V) delivered by a computer,
servovalve (Fig. 24). Depending on the electrical signal (
the spool slides inside the bushing of the control stage. The power stage spool is then
moved, and the inlet/outlet connect the expansion chamber of the hydraulic piston with
the high and low pressure accumulators. Any movement of the latter has then a direct
eﬀect on the main piston rod. The nominal control ﬂow rate of the servovalve (control
stage) is 28 l/min, and the opening time is about 6 ms. The power ﬂow rate through the
servovalve can reach 1500 l/min, which leads to an expansion time of about 150 ms for
the maximum stroke of 200 mm. Shorter piston strokes are more rapid; for example, the
expansion time is below 10 ms for a 5 mm expansion (which produces a supersaturation
of about 6%). The limiting parameter is the ability of the main piston head to with-
stand acceleration. The hydraulic system provides complete ﬂexibility for the choice of
expansion and re-compression cycles, which are determined by the analogue voltage pulse

The hydraulic piston (100 mm diameter) has no seal and its ﬁt within the cylinder
is of prime importance. A prototype of the main piston, hydraulic piston and servovalve
system is required in order to validate the study and ﬁx the parameters for the ﬁnal
installation, such as the pressure loss in the circuits and the leaks to be compensated.
The maximal allowable acceleration of the piston is another important issue that requires
evaluation with the prototype.

±

4.2.5 Liquid cooling system

The liquid cooling and temperature control system for CLOUD (Fig. 25) involves a closed
circuit system, insulated throughout by vacuum. The liquid coolant ﬂows through a jacket
surrounding the cloud chamber and maintains the inner wall and piston at a precisely-
controlled temperature. The gas inside the cloud chamber is allowed to reach thermal
equilibrium with the walls before taking any measurements. A ﬂuorocarbon liquid is used,
such as FC87 (C5F12), which is liquid in the range 163 K–303 K at atmospheric pressure.
The ﬂuorocarbon is transparent to visible and UV wavelengths down to about 180 nm.
Consequently the liquid can circulate between the windows to obtain the optimum thermal
jacket, without compromising the optical measurements or the option of UV irradiation

of the active volume.

A coolant reservoir, circulation pump and heat exchanger are placed in a cold box.
The temperature of the circulating ﬂuorocarbon liquid is adjustable in the range from
173 K–293 K. Temperatures are measured with Pt1000 platinum resistance thermome-
ters which provide measurements stable to 0.001 K. The ﬂuorocarbon is cooled by liq-
uid nitrogen evaporating at a constant pressure, and re-heated by an electrical heater.
This allows ﬁne temperature control and higher stability than can be obtained with a
refrigerator unit. Our experience of similar liquid cooling systems for particle physics
detectors shows that temperature stabilities of 0.1 K can be achieved for relatively large,
non-insulated detectors involving internal heat sources and located in experimental halls
without air-conditioning. In comparison, the CLOUD system is relatively compact, insu-
lated throughout by a vacuum layer, and without any internal parasitic heat loads. This
indicates that, with careful design, a temperature stability of 0.01 K can be achieved.

4.2.6 Field cage

The walls of the cloud chamber are equipped with a ﬁeld cage which provides an electric
ﬁeld inside the active volume. The functions of the electric ﬁeld are as follows:

•

•

To clear ions and charged aerosols from the active volume.

To allow measurements at below atmospheric ion concentrations. The typical ion
concentration at the top of the troposphere is a few 1000 cm−3 (Section D.1); the

42

Figure 26: Vertical section showing the ﬂow chamber and beam counter system.

•

•

clearing ﬁeld can lower the small ion concentration in the cloud chamber to near
zero in about 2 s (Section 5.3).

To separate positive and negative ions and charged aerosols in order to measure
their properties separately.
In addition, this will allow a technique for slowing
charge neutralisation by +/- ion recombination.

To allow an approximate measurement of the aerosol size/charge distributions by
measurement of the electrical mobility before activation. This is done by allowing
the ions and charged aerosols to drift in a uniform ﬁeld for a known time before the
expansion pulse. The resulting droplets eﬀectively freeze the ﬁnal locations of the
charged particles and allow their drift paths to be estimated and hence also their
electrical mobilities. This provides a technique to check for consistency with the
more precise mobility measurements provided by external detectors.

The ﬁeld cage involves circular electrodes laid down on an 800 µm-thick ceramic
insulating layer which lines the inside of the cloud chamber. The electrodes are continued
across the chamber windows by means of thin, vacuum-deposited traces; these result in
a negligible loss of light intensity for the optical readout systems. A layer of electrodes

43

at the top of the cylinder completes the ﬁeld cage. Except in the region of the windows,
the electrodes are covered with a layer of black teﬂon, which is in contact with the gas in
the active volume. The teﬂon has a small conductivity in order to avoid charge buildup
and consequent ﬁeld distortion. The cloud chamber walls and piston are grounded, and
the ﬁeld wire potentials are appropriately set relative to this ground, up to a maximum
of 500 V. The performance of the ﬁeld cage is summarised in Section 5.3.

4.2.7 Flow chamber

A ﬂow chamber of dimensions 2 m length
6cm-diameter is integrated with the cloud
×
chamber assembly (Fig. 26). It is ﬁlled with the same gas/aerosol mixture as the cloud
chamber, and exposed to the same particle beam and, where required, to the same UV ir-
radiation. Furthermore it is operated at the same temperature and pressure, but without
the need for the same high precision on temperature and pressure stability. The exhaust
gas from the ﬂow chamber is analysed using condensation particle counters (CPC), dif-
ferential mobility particle sizers (DMPS), mass spectrometers and ion mobility detectors
(see Fig. 32 and Sections 4.4 and 4.5).

4.3 Optical readout

4.3.1 Constant angle Mie scattering (CAMS) detector

The CAMS detection method allows simultaneous measurement of number concentra-
tion and size of growing droplets. This method has been successfully applied in various
experimental studies of nucleation and condensation processes [75, 76, 77]. A detailed
description of theoretical and experimental aspects of the CAMS detection method can
be found elsewhere [78, 79]. The general schematic layout of a CAMS system is show
in Fig. 27 and the geometry for CLOUD is shown in Fig. 21. In the following the main
features of CAMS are presented as they are relevant for the proposed research project.

Figure 27: Schematic diagram showing the experimental arrangement for the CAMS
detection method.

44

The CAMS detection method is based on light scattering. Growing spherical parti-
cles are illuminated by a monochromatic, parallel light beam, e.g. a laser beam (Fig. 27).
The light ﬂux Φtrans transmitted through the measuring chamber is monitored during
the particle growth process by means of photodetector TD. Simultaneously, the light
ﬂux Φsca scattered at a selectable constant scattering angle Θ is monitored by means of
photodetector SD. The observation cones of the detectors are deﬁned by corresponding
lens-pinhole arrangements L-PH. The actual sensitive volume VS inside the measuring
chamber is determined by the intersection of laser beam and observation cone of detector
SD for scattered light.

Our measurements from a typical CAMS experiment are shown in Fig. 28. Here si-
multaneous growth of liquid drops in supersaturated vapour was observed. The vapour
supersaturation was achieved by means of an adiabatic pressure jump in an initially sat-
urated system. This pressure step is indicated by the upper curve in Fig. 28. The middle
curve in Fig. 28 shows (inverted) the transmitted light ﬂux Φtrans as a function of time
during the droplet growth process. The lowest curve shows the scattered light ﬂux Φsca
as a function of time. In the experiment considered a forward scattering angle Θ = 15◦
was chosen, the incident laser beam was linearly polarized perpendicular to the plane of
observation.

As can be seen from Fig. 28, the experimental scattered light ﬂux vs. time curve shows a
series of maxima and minima. These extrema are connected to light diﬀraction and can be
uniquely identiﬁed, as will be shown below. Thereby the particle size can be determined
at each of the experimental extrema.
In the absence of multiple light scattering the
experimental scattered light ﬂux will be proportional to the number of particles inside the
scattering volume. Accordingly, the droplet number concentration can be evaluated from
the height of the experimental light scattering maxima independent of the determination
of particle size.

The middle curve in Fig. 28 (inverted in the ﬁgure) shows that the transmitted light
ﬂux Φtrans decreases signiﬁcantly during the droplet growth process. Thus it can be
concluded that considerable light extinction can occur inside the measuring chamber,
particularly at later stages of the particle growth process. This light extinction will be
increasingly pronounced for increasing particle number concentrations. Obviously the ex-
perimental scattered light ﬂux will be reduced due to light extinction in the measuring
chamber as well. Thereby the values of the particle number concentrations, as determined
directly from the height of the experimental light scattering maxima, will generally be
somewhat smaller than the actual concentrations. A correction for this light extinction
eﬀect would require the knowledge of the actual particle number concentration. Fortu-
nately, the reduction of the scattered light ﬂux due to light extinction can be taken into
account in the following way. As seen from Fig. 28, the scattered light ﬂux Φsca will suﬀer
approximately the same light extinction as the transmitted light ﬂux Φtrans, if the scat-
tering volume VS is restricted to the central part of the measuring chamber. Thus the
eﬀect of light extinction on the scattered light ﬂux can be compensated by normalising
the scattered relative to the transmitted light ﬂux. Accordingly, a linear relation between
the normalised scattered light ﬂux Φsca/Φtrans and the particle number concentration can
be expected over a wide concentration range.

In order to achieve a unique quantitative interpretation of the light scattering curves
as obtained from CAMS experiments, it is important to calculate the normalised scattered

light ﬂux Φsca/Φtrans as a function of droplet size for various constant scattering angles.
The theory of light scattering by spherical particles has been derived by Mie [80] and Debye
[81]; a recent treatise by Bohren and Huﬀmann [82] includes eﬃcient numerical methods
for evaluation of the relevant light scattering functions. Fig. 29 shows a comparison of
experimental scattered light ﬂux vs. time curves with theoretical scattered light ﬂux vs. size
curves for forward scattering angle Θ = 15◦. Satisfactory agreement between experimental
and theoretical data can be observed allowing to establish a one-to-one correspondence
of experimental and theoretical light scattering extrema.

The morphology of the light scattering curves depends on the size distribution of the
growing droplets. As can be seen from Fig. 30, the resonant ripple structure of the light
scattering curves tends to disappear with increasing width of the drop size distribution.
Thus CAMS measurements require suﬃciently narrow drop size distributions to identify
unambiguously a single peak in isolation. However it can be seen that the ﬁrst scattering
maximum at the forward scattering angle Θ = 15◦ is not very sensitive to changes of the
width of the drop size distribution.

When a unique correspondence between experimental and theoretical light scatter-
ing extrema is established, the particle sizes at speciﬁc times during the growth process
can be obtained from the positions of the extrema of the experimental normalised light
scattering curves relative to the time axis. Independently, the droplet number concen-
trations at speciﬁc times during the growth process can be determined from the heights
of the maxima of the experimental normalised light scattering curve by comparison to
the corresponding theoretical curve. In this connection it is important to note that, as
mentioned above, the normalised scattered light ﬂux Φsca/Φtrans is linearly related to the
droplet number concentration. Determination of the droplet number concentration can

thus be performed by measurement of the ratio Φsca/Φtrans of scattered and transmitted
light ﬂux. To this end it is necessary to perform a mutual calibration of the detectors TD
and SD for transmitted and scattered light ﬂuxes, respectively. This calibration can be
avoided by quantitatively considering the light extinction inside the measuring chamber.
From measurements of the light extinction at certain droplet sizes the droplet number
concentration can be determined independently.

The choice of appropriate scattering angles depends on the actual measurements to
be performed. For determination of particle concentrations it is advantageous to use
comparatively small forward scattering angles, because the corresponding light scattering
curves exhibit a rather simple structure with few broad maxima, which can easily be
identiﬁed even for comparatively broad droplet size distributions. Furthermore, compar-
atively high scattered light ﬂuxes occur, allowing accurate measurements of the heights of
the observed light scattering maxima. For measurements of drop growth rates, however,
somewhat larger scattering angles are advantageous, because the corresponding light scat-
tering curves show a somewhat more complex structure, providing detailed information
on drop growth.

In summary the CAMS detection method is applicable to the observation of growing
spherical particles (droplets) with known refractive index. The droplet size distribution

47

needs to be suﬃciently narrow so that distinct extrema can be observed in the experi-
mental light scattering curves. Measurements over a comparatively wide range of droplet
number concentrations can be performed. The lower limit of the concentration measur-
ing range depends on the actual sensitive volume VS as determined by the incident laser
beam and the observation cone of the detector SD for scattered light. In order to allow a
unique evaluation of the experimental scattered light curves, generally more than about
5 particles must be simultaneously present inside the sensitive volume during particle
growth. The upper limit of the particle concentration range will depend primarily on the
amount of multiple scattering inside the measuring chamber [79]. As shown recently [83],
CAMS measurements show a linear concentration response over a range of concentrations
up to as much as several 107 particles per cm3. Finally it should be noted that the CAMS
detection method is a non-invasive method for absolute measurement of drop size and
number concentration. No empirical calibration referring to external reference standards
is required.

4.3.2 CCD cameras and optics

CCD cameras and readout: The Rutherford Appleton Laboratory has designed and
built a very fast, twin channel CCD imaging system for the August 1999 total solar eclipse,
which is available for CLOUD. The SECIS (Solar Eclipse Coronal Imaging System) was
successfully used to obtain in excess of 12,000 images during totality (i.e. in a period of
less than 3 minutes) from a site close to the Black Sea in Bulgaria.

In essence, SECIS is an extremely fast, high-resolution imaging system. It is a con-
siderable advance over previous systems in both frame rate and photometric accuracy.
To meet the requirements of the solar eclipse observation, consecutive large area images
needed to be stored at a very fast rate that was not until recently possible in any existing
system but now is technically feasible using new developments in CCD cameras and mem-
ory storage units. Currently, SECIS uses two small-area CCDs to obtain fast images and
large on-line processing arrays to handle the image data. The computer system, interfaces
and camera power supplies ﬁt in a medium-sized, portable PC enclosure. Extra cooling
is built into the enclosure to allow operation in hotter environments than normal. An
uninterruptible power supply provides power for the whole system. Each frame of data is
time-tagged for subsequent individual access from the PC.

The solar eclipse experiment required the capability of storing a large number (several
thousand) consecutive frames of data without interruption. The two CCD cameras used

are state-of-the-art digital cameras. Each has a 512
The data is digitised to 12 bits and clocked out at a frame rate of 55 Hz (which is well
above the 10 Hz rate required for CLOUD). These images are “grabbed” by a specially-
adapted PC, with dual Pentium processors. The PC has two PCI cards which provide the
two camera interfaces; the cards are linked to ensure that there is no variation in timing
between the two cameras. Exposure time and frequency are derived from programmable
crystal-based oscillators. The operating system is Microsoft Windows NT Workstation.
The computer system captures two synchronised video streams from the two CCD cam-
eras. It then reconstitutes the video images and stores them on a computer network for
detailed oﬀ-line analysis. The data is buﬀered and sent to the computer via diﬀerential
parallel cables. These also carry camera control signals generated by the computer to

×

48

start and stop the light collection on the CCDs and to trigger the data transfer. The
exposure time and frequency can therefore be selected by the operator.

The video data is packed by the PCI cards and temporarily stored in two buﬀer sets in
main memory. As the buﬀers become full, the data is transferred to four SCSI disk drives,
each 9 Gb in size. This is suﬃcient for about 36 min continuous operation at the full rate
of 1 Gbyte/min (50 Hz). Each image is divided into 4 and each quarter image is stored
on a separate hard drive. For data analysis, the reverse process takes the quarter images
from each hard drive in the correct sequence and rebuilds the original full frame. These
frames are then written out to the network disk as FITS images for compatibility with
many diﬀerent software packages. During normal operations, the workload is shared by
the two processors. Two small live images can be displayed together with the buﬀer-ﬁlling
status to allow the computer operator to monitor the performance of the system.

This system currently exists and is available for the CLOUD experiment. However,
we are planning to upgrade the cameras to use newer CCD chips with a smaller pixel size
and more pixels per chip.

Optics for the cloud chamber: For the performance ﬁgures presented in this section,
we will assume that each CCD camera has an upgraded chip of 1024 (h)
2048 (v) pixels,
16.2 (v) mm2. Since many
with a pixel size of 8
CCD chips are already on the market with higher speciﬁcations,15 the ﬁgures presented
here should be considered as conservative.

8 µm2 and an active area of 8.2 (h)

×

×

The CCD cameras are arranged in a stereo pair as indicated in Fig. 31. The optics
are adjustable between a wide ﬁeld-of-view and a narrow one. The former can be used to
simultaneously measure regions of the chamber exposed to beam and not exposed. This
requires a wide illumination ﬁeld, which is provided by a xenon ﬂash lamps mounted at
the top window. This produces dark-ﬁeld-illumination, i.e bright droplet images on a
dark background. The ﬂashlamps provide 100 J/pulse at up to 10 Hz; the power source
is a 100 µF capacitor-bank charged to 1500 V. Experience with the 38 cm Missouri-Rolla
chamber has shown, for xenon ﬂash illumination, the scattered light intensity from a
droplet is directly proportional to its radius in the range 2–20 µm. (This was the limit of
the measurement; the proportionality probably continues either side of this range.) This
indicates that the pulse height information from the CCD will provide measurements of
the radii of individual droplets.

An alternative illumination scheme is provided by xenon ﬂashlamps along the viewing
direction (“ringﬂash” in Fig. 31). UV-absorbing ﬁlters (λmin = 450 nm) are used to avoid
photo-ionisation reactions inside the chamber. To obtain the best sensitivity at high
droplet number densities, only the shallow region corresponding to the depth-of-focus of
the CCD cameras is illuminated (see Table 4). This is achieved by focusing light from the
upper xenon lamp with a cylindrical lens and collimating the beam with slits. The narrow
ﬁeld-of-view optics is optimised for measurements recorded at the same time as the CAMS
detector, where a small volume within the acceptance of the cameras is illuminated by a
narrow laser beam.

Some representative choices of the optical parameters are indicated in Table 4. For all

4.4 Gas and aerosol systems

4.4.1 Overview

A schematic of the gas and aerosol supply and analysis systems is shown in Fig. 32. The
supply system involves four components: carrier gas, water vapour, aerosols and trace
gases. The carrier gas is either pure artiﬁcial air (80% N2, 20% O2) or argon. Water
vapour, aerosols and trace gases are mixed into this stream at the desired levels (see
Table 3). The water vapour and aerosol systems are described in more detail below.

Figure 32: Schematic showing the elements of the gas and aerosol supply systems and the
physical and chemical analysis systems.

4.4.2 Water vapour system

The water vapour content in the chamber will be set by two techniques: a) a liquid
or ice ﬁlm on the top of the piston and b) vapour and carrier gas introduced from an
external humidiﬁer. For most experiments, the saturation ratio before expansion will be
p/p0 = (100.00
0.05)%, where p is the partial pressure of the water vapour and p0 is
the saturated vapour pressure over a plane surface of water (or ice) at this temperature.
(The error of 0.05% corresponds to a temperature variation of 0.01 K.) The vapour will
be provided by a liquid or ice ﬁlm covering most of the top of the piston and maintained

±

51

at the precise ambient temperature. This design has several important advantages: a)
the amount of liquid needed is low and thus can be high purity and also be changed easily
if contamination of the liquid ﬁlm is suspected, b) it allows the introduction of liquids
other than water if needed, and c) the ﬁlm will cover most of the piston top but will not
touch the walls, thus eliminating problems that might occur when the liquid ﬁlm (water)
freezes.

For experiments that require initial saturation ratios in the range 50% < p/p0 < 100%,
an external humidiﬁer will be used. A straightforward method to produce a very precise
water vapour content from an external source is to use the saturated vapour and carrier
gas from a liquid pool that is very well temperature regulated, as indicated above. The
vapour and carrier gas can then be accurately diluted to produce a known (water) vapour
concentration. In order to avoid any problems due to contamination of the surface of the
water with surfactants, the surface is continually renewed by ﬂowing the water over many
glass rods in a tower structure through which the carrier gas ﬂows.

4.4.3 Aerosol system

Particle generation: Aerosol particle generation for the project will depend on the
particle size required. To generate submicron particles for laboratory experiments, two
standard techniques are available. Nebulizers are used to generate particles in the size
range of 10–1000 nm. In a nebulizer, a small liquid ﬂow is introduced into a pressurised
air ﬂow through a nozzle. The liquid ﬂow is distributed into small droplets, which can be
made to evaporate after the nozzle by adjusting the fraction of the volatile compound in
the liquid. The ﬁnal particle size is set by the fraction of residual non-volatile component
in each droplet [84, 85]. When a slightly smaller size range is needed e.g. particle diameter
3–200 nm, a technique based on evaporation and condensation of either salts or metals
can be used [86].

Determination of number concentration of particles: Detection of submicron
particles is usually carried out by use of condensation particle counters (CPC) or faraday
cup electrometers (FCE). The most appropriate instruments are commercial CPCs by
TSI. One model is used to determine number concentration of particles with diameters
exceeding 10 nm [87]. Another instrument, especially suitable for ultraﬁne particles can
be used for particles with diameters exceeding 3 nm [88]. A CPC connected with a pulse
height analyser can also, in certain conditions, measure the size distribution in a very
narrow size range of 3–10 nm [89]. Smaller sizes can only be measured in the main cloud
chamber.

Size classiﬁcation of particles: The above particle counters (CPC 3010 and CPC
3010) can be used in combination with a size classiﬁcation method, based on the electri-
cal mobility of particles, to provide a diﬀerential mobility particle sizer, DMPS [90, 91].
Alternatively, as a more novel technique, they can be used in a scanning mode as a scan-
ning mobility particle sizer (SMPS). High performance of these instruments requires a well
controlled ﬂow arrangement [92], determination of size resolution of the size classiﬁcation
[93] and control of the artiﬁcial electrical charging of particles [94, 95]. The mobility

52

spectrum obtained from these measurements can be inverted to obtain the number size
distribution of the particles [96] with a time resolution of 1-10 min.

In general, submicron particles are quite eﬃciently trans-
Transmission eﬃciency:
ported in small tubes by standard carrier gas ﬂows. The main mechanisms for transport
losses are deposition onto tubing walls by diﬀusion, gravitational settling of particles in
the tubing, as well as inertial losses of particles at sharp tube bends. Diﬀusion losses
are only signiﬁcant for particles smaller than approximately 20 nm [97]. These remaining
processes are usually signiﬁcant only for particles sizes exceeding about 100 nm [84, 85].
For particle size range of 10-1000 nm, usually no other processes aﬀect the transmission in
ﬂow tubes. However if high electrical ﬁelds or large thermal gradients are present in the
tubing, then electrical precipitation and thermophoretic eﬀects may become important.

4.5 Analysis of trace gases and ions

4.5.1 Overview

We will analyse the trace chemical species and ions expected from the ﬂow chamber, as
well as any new chemicals that may be formed. Trace gas analysis will be performed
by two mass spectrometers. A third mass spectrometer (PITMAS) will determine the
chemical composition of ions, and ion mass and mobility spectrometers will detect growth
processes, which are crucial for the observation of ion-assisted particle production.

trometer (CIMS) by MPIK-Heidelberg. The data show vertical proﬁles of the mixing
ratios of (CH3)2CO (acetone), HNO3, SO2 and gaseous H2SO4 over central Europe in
December 1995. The altitude is indicated as potential vorticity (PV) [103]. Typically the
tropopause is located around 3.5 PVU.

The MPIK-Heidelberg Chemical Ionisation Mass Spectrometer (CIMS) measures trace
1 pptv16) and fast time response
gases with high sensitivity (typical detection limit
(
10 s). The CIMS-instrument consists of an ion ﬂow reactor coupled to an eﬃciently-
∼
pumped linear quadrupole mass spectrometer. The instruments used have been developed
and successfully employed by the MPIK-Heidelberg group for atmospheric measurements
at ground level as well as on research balloons, rockets, and aircraft [98]–[102]. A typical
measurement is shown in Fig. 33. In a recent development, the linear quadrupole mass
spectrometer has been replaced by a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (PITMAS)
which has been modiﬁed for the application to measurements of trace gases in the atmo-
sphere [104]. The high duty cycle which is oﬀered by this instrument is of advantage for
the measurements of trace gases down to the sub-pptv range. In the CLOUD experiment,
CIMS will be used for measurements of the following trace gases: H2SO4, SO2, HNO3
and NH3. These are potentially important with respect to ion-induced aerosol forma-
tion under tropospheric conditions. Typical volume mixing ratios of these gases in the
“clean” upper troposphere are the following: 0.05–0.5 pptv (H2SO4), 10-1000 pptv (SO2),
and 100–1000 pptv (HNO3). For upper tropospheric conditions the CIMS-detection limits
for measurement of these trace gases are currently estimated to be 0.05 pptv (H2SO4, 1
minute time resolution), 1 pptv (SO2, 30 s time resolution), and 50 pptv (HNO3, 10 s time
resolution).

4.5.3 Time-of-ﬂight (ToF) mass spectrometer

The ToF ion mass spectrometer developed by St. Petersburg-Aarhus uses pulsed electron
impact ionisation of a gas sample, extraction by an electric ﬁeld of the produced ions, and
subsequent drift of the ions to a detector that counts the ions as a function of the time of
arrival. The instrument will be used to measure changes of the chemical composition of
the gas mixture from the ﬂow reactor chambers or the cloud chamber (extracted with the
sampling probes). The main advantage of ToF mass/charge analysis in comparison with
other methods is the possibility to register simultaneously ions over a very wide range
of masses and with relatively high mass/charge resolution. The measurements are made
on-line and the results are available in real-time. The ToF analysis includes the following
steps:

1. Taking a gas sample: A large reduction of pressure is necessary because a pressure
of less than 10−4 Torr is required by the ToF spectrometer. Two techniques are
planned for use. The ﬁrst is short sampling, synchronised and delayed relative to the
particle beam for studies of the time dependence of chemical processes. The second
is sampling into a buﬀer volume with long-term analysis to increase sensitivity to
trace gases. In both cases there is a problem of maintaining the initial composition
of gas mixture. Therefore teﬂon or proper plastic with non-nucleating surface can
be chosen in the valves.

2. Ionisation of gas sample: Electron impact ionisation at single collision conditions is
planned. In many cases non-dissociative ionisation prevails or dissociation fractions

16pptv denotes parts per trillion by volume.

54

are known.
In some speciﬁc cases the identiﬁcation of the initial composition of
molecules will be veriﬁed by calibration experiments with mixtures having known
composition.

3. Registration of ion signals: Ions are registered in current or in counting mode. Both
will be used to provide at the same time high sensitivity for weak lines (counting
mode) and the ability to deal with the large number of ions in the strong lines
(current mode). This is facilitated by the fact that the intense lines correspond to
masses less than 40 amu and the interesting trace lines to larger masses.

The ToF spectrometer has the following performance:

Maximum ratio of ion line intensities at simultaneous registration: 104.

Minimum ion line signal intensity (equal to background counting rate): 0.01 Hz.

•
The mass range and the resolving power can be improved if necessary. A typical
experimental spectrum is shown in Fig. 34 [105]. It shows on semi-logarithmic scale the
composition of ions formed by ionisation of ambient air and Ar. As can be seen in Fig. 34
there are lines corresponding to formation of singly and multiply charged ions of diﬀerent
gases, molecular ions and their dissociation fragment and also to isotopes of 36Ar and 38Ar
having low relative concentrations (about 0.34% and 0.06% respectively).

the exit of the engine and the sampling point. The initial rise of the ion signal is a well
known instrumental eﬀect. The spectra indicate the presence of very massive ions, above
even 8500 amu. The fractions of ions with masses exceeding 8500 are 0.0023 (for positive
ions) and 0.01 (for negative ions).

4.5.4 Ion mass spectrometers

≤

≤

10 000 (IOMAS) and m

The MPIK-Heidelberg IOMAS (Ion Mass Spectrometer) and quadrupole ion trap mass
spectrometer (PITMAS) instruments measure the mass distribution of positive and neg-
ative ions with mass numbers m
4000 (PITMAS). IOMAS
is a linear quadrupole mass spectrometer which is usually operated in a high-pass-mode
(HPM). The HPM is very sensitive and particularly well suited for situations with numer-
ous ion species each having only a small fractional abundance. The present mass range
of IOMAS extends from gaseous molecules having mass numbers of several hundred up
to very massive ions having diameters in the range of several nm. Therefore it covers
the mass range of small clusters which are formed subsequently during the initial steps
of nucleation. These clusters, however, are too small to be detectable by condensation
nucleus counters (CPCs)—although they are of course readily detected in the CLOUD
expansion chamber when operated with a relatively large expansion. The performance
of IOMAS has been demonstrated recently in ﬂow reactor experiments made at MPIK-
Heidelberg [106]. In these experiments large cluster ions have been produced by adding
of sulphur dioxide and water vapour into a ﬂow reactor where ions and OH radicals were
produced. By varying the amounts of sulphur dioxide and water vapour, eﬃcient growth
of cluster ions consisting of numerous H2SO4/H2O molecules could be observed. In ad-
dition, our measurements of the exhaust from jet aircraft made both on the ground and
in ﬂight show that very massive ions with mass numbers exceeding 10000 are present
[107, 108] (Fig. 35). These measurements conﬁrm the importance of ions in the formation
of volatile aerosols in the exhaust from jet aircraft, which has been suggested recently

56

[109, 110]. Evidence for the existence of “chemiions” in the exhaust of jet aircraft also
comes from measurements of the total ion concentration in the exhaust of a jet aircraft
recently made by MPIK-Heidelberg [111], and from mass spectrometer measurements of
negative chemiions with mass numbers larger than 450 [112].

In addition, the MPIK-Heidelberg PITMAS instrument would be available for chem-
ical identiﬁcation of complex ions produced in the CLOUD experiment. PITMAS oﬀers
a particularly attractive addition on the analytical potential, namely fragmentation stud-
ies of mass-selected ions. PITMAS can be operated in two modes. The ﬁrst of these is
a standard mode that produces ion mass spectra with a very high mass resolution and
a large mass range (up to m = 4000). Provided that the intensity of an ion signal is
suﬃcient, the second mode allows for speciﬁc fragmentation studies of mass-selected ions
with mass number up to 2000. In this mode only ions of a single mass are trapped. The
kinetic energy of the trapped ions is increased and leads to collision-induced dissociation
(CID) through collisions with He atoms that are introduced into the spectrometer. For
complex ions or cluster ions, usually several diﬀerent fragment ion species are produced.
The fragment ion pattern is, in most cases, characteristic of a parent ion species. In a
second CID step, one of the diﬀerent fragment ion species can be trapped and a CID study
can be made leading to second generation fragment ions. In the same way even higher
order generations of fragment ions can be produced [113]. Consider, for example, an ion
with m = 2000 amu. If measured by a conventional ion mass spectrometer giving only
m, an identiﬁcation of the ion will be extremely diﬃcult, if not impossible. By contrast
PITMAS has the potential to pin down the identity of the ion. Another application of
PITMAS involves trapping of ions with one m and subsequent interaction of the trapped
ions with a reagent gas which is introduced into the trap. Thereby ions may be identiﬁed
due to their diﬀerent chemical reactivity leading to characteristic product ions.

potential. The cylinder is enclosed in another metal cylinder which provides a shield. Air
containing the ions under analysis is ﬂowed through the cylinder at a known rate and the
current is recorded with a femtoammeter.

The PIMS uses technology developed at Reading to measure the low ion concentrations
found in the atmosphere at ground level [115]. The Reading ion spectrometer is a fully
programmable device which can measure ions self-consistently in two independent modes,
as shown in Fig. 37. The PIMS can also be operated dynamically to utilise mobility
cut-oﬀs appropriate to the ions produced, which will allow the evolution of the whole
ion spectrum to be examined, before the particle measurement system. In addition, the
PIMS can measure the total ion concentration, which will permit calculation of absolute
concentrations from the ion mass spectrometers.

The ion counters for CLOUD are miniaturised versions of the recent Reading design
[115], constructed in a cylindrical geometry from stainless steel and PTFE, with a central
platinum wire electrode. In the ﬂow chamber, a cross section of 1 cm will be used to reduce
the volume ﬂow rate through the instrument. Adjustment of the bias voltage depending
on the ﬂow rate is a simple procedure. Several PIMS detectors measuring diﬀerent ion
mobilities will be arranged sequentially to minimise the ﬂow rate, and to ensure the same
sample of air is measured. Techniques have already been developed to reliably measure
the very small ion currents involved [116, 117].

4.6 Data acquisition and oﬄine analysis

4.6.1 Data acquisition and slow control

The CLOUD data acquisition (DAQ) system (Fig. 38) is designed to collect and record
a) the operating parameters of the cloud chamber and other detector systems and b) the
data from the optical readout systems and other equipment during the periods of beam
exposure and droplet growth. It must be be highly ﬂexible in order to accommodate the
many diﬀerent run conditions necessary for the various experiments.

The slow control (SLC) system17 is responsible for the software control of all operating
conditions for the experiment. It includes deﬁning the timing and pressure cycle for the
piston expansion/compression, operating the gas valves, controlling the gas and aerosol
ﬂow rates, setting the voltages for the ﬁeld cage electrodes, and setting voltages and other
parameters for each of the detector systems.

Functions: The functions of the DAQ and SLC systems are to:

•

Provide a user-friendly control of the run conditions, (beam on/oﬀ, beam energy,
etc.) and of the parameters for the cloud chamber and other detectors.

17It is called slow control in particle physics terminology since it typically involves timescales of a
few seconds rather than the nanosecond or microsecond timescales characteristic of fast logic and data
acquisition.

cluster of several single/double-CPU machines. The platform of choice will be a PC

the CPU of the central machine or with local desktop Linux machines. Home institutions
will be equipped by scalable Linux facilities, with a suﬃcient amount of disk space to

local analyses.

in general and of the LHC community in particular towards modern computing solutions,
even given the relative smallness of our data sample. As an example the integration with
the currently proposed solution for persistency and software architecture will be among
the ﬁrst software development tasks. End-user data analyses will also centre around the
software tools of the new generation of experiments, such as ROOT[118] and LHC++[119].

5.1 Droplet growth time

5.1.1 Principles of droplet growth

An aerosol will grow by condensation if the water vapour supersaturation exceeds a critical
value, which depends on the size and nature of the aerosol (Appendix A.1). Once the
growth process has started, it continues since the equilibrium vapour pressure decreases
with increasing droplet size. Eventually the growth stops when suﬃcient water vapour
has been removed that the supersaturation is reduced.

The driving force that determines the rate at which liquid mass condenses onto the

droplet is the supersaturation relative to the equilibrium value, SS(r):

SS(r) = (S

−

−

a
r

+

where S is the water vapour saturation ratio with respect to the vapour pressure over a
plane surface of water, and r is the radius of the droplet. The a/r term corresponds to
the eﬀect of curvature (Kelvin’s equation) and the b/r3 term corresponds to the eﬀect of
dissolved solute (Raoult’s law). This is the form of the K¨ohler equation (Fig. 46).

The growth process of a droplet occurs by diﬀusion of water molecules from the vapour
onto its surface. Associated with the condensation is the release of latent heat, which tends
to raise the temperature of the droplet above its surroundings. This increases the rate
of evaporation and decreases the rate of growth. The size of this eﬀect is determined by
the rate at which heat is conducted away from the droplet by the surrounding gas. The
resulting growth rate is given by [120]:

where Fk represents the latent heat term and Fd the vapour diﬀusion term. When the
droplet becomes suﬃciently large, the a/r and b/r3 terms in Eq. 1 are negligible compared
with (S

5.1.2 Simulation of droplet growth

We have studied the formation and growth of the cloud droplets using a simple convection
model describing a rising cloud parcel. We have assumed a constant updraft velocity
without entrainment, since we are primarily interested in droplet formation. The air
parcel contains aerosol particles, water and the other condensable vapours (nitric acid,
hydrochloric acid and ammonia). The aerosol particle distribution is described using four

62

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

log-normal size distributions. The ﬁrst distribution consists of less hygroscopic Aitken
mode18 particles, the second of more hygroscopic Aitken mode particles, the third of less
hygroscopic accumulation mode particles and the fourth of more hygroscopic accumulation
mode particles.

In the beginning of a simulation (at the cloud base) dry particles are allowed to take
up water and the other condensing vapours and reach equilibrium with the ambient air.
The air parcel starts to rise and cool adiabatically, the saturation ratio increases, and the
vapours begin to condense into the haze particles. The saturation ratio of water vapour
rises typically slightly over unity, after which it decreases to a value near unity. Although
the water vapour saturation ratio decreases, some particles continue to grow, because they
have been activated and a cloud droplet population has formed.

Condensation model:
In the model the condensation of the vapours is simulated by
numerically integrating a set of ordinary diﬀerential equations, based on the model used
by Kulmala et al.
[121]. In the present study we have slightly changed the diﬀerential
equations describing the change of the masses of the species in the droplet. The rate of
change of the mass of the condensing species j in the droplet size class p is obtained from
the equation

dmj,p

dt ≡

Ij,p,

where the mass ﬂux Ij,p is the rate at which the mass of species j transports through a
surface area of a droplet in the size-class p. The mass ﬂuxes can be calculated from the
matrix equation

data measured in Vienna [125]. We have assumed initial aerosol particles of radius about
25 nm. To grow these into droplets of radius 1 µm when the saturation ratio, S, is 1.2
takes less than 100 ms. If S = 1.02 it takes about 1 s and if S = 1.002 it takes about
10 s. These values can be scaled to other droplet radii and other supersaturations since

5.2 Sensitive time of the cloud chamber

After an expansion has taken place, heat gradually leaks into the chamber, the supersat-
uration diminishes and after a certain time (termed the sensitive time) condensation can
no longer take place on the activated droplets. It is therefore important that the sensi-
tive time is suﬃciently long to allow activated droplets to grow at least to the minimum
detectable size (about 1 µm diameter).

Immediately after the expansion, the gas temperature has fallen but the walls of the
chamber remains at the equilibrium temperature value prior to the expansion. The gas
layer close to the walls then begins to heat up, expand and rise by convection. The
expansion of the boundary layer causes the gas inside to re-compress adiabatically, which
warms it and causes the supersaturation to fall. Because of the low thermal conductivity
of air, heat conduction is an insigniﬁcant process for re-heating of the central gas volume.
This sensitive time of a cloud chamber, ts, due to this re-compression process is cal-

culated [126] to have the following dependencies:

L2
P
(∆V /V )2

·

ts ∝

T 2

·

(5)

where L is the linear dimension of the cloud chamber, ∆V /V is the volume expansion
ratio, P the pressure and T the temperature. This expression shows that long sensitive
times require large chambers since the sensitive time increases as the square of the linear
dimension (i.e. as the square of the ratio of volume/surface area, (V /A)2).

The sensitive time is expected to be proportional to P/T 2 ( Eq. 5). Since low pressures
and low temperatures occur together in the troposphere, these eﬀects partially compen-
sate. However the reduction in pressure dominates and so ts decreases, e.g. it is reduced
by a factor of about two for the conditions corresponding to 10 km altitude.

Equation 5 indicates that the sensitive time increases for smaller expansions (which
give rise to smaller temperature diﬀerences between the walls and the gas). For small
expansion ratios, there is a linear relationship with the resultant supersaturation, e.g. at
298 K (Table 5):

exceed 5000 cm−3. Vapour depletion and latent heat production during growth, however,
must be quantitatively accounted for, even for growth times less than 10 s. From Eq. 5, the
50 cm CLOUD expansion chamber should therefore have about a factor 4 longer sensitive
time under the same conditions. At lower supersaturations, the sensitive time should
further increase, proportionally to 1/SS2, e.g. by a factor 100 at 0.2% supersaturation.
Under these very low supersaturations, the expected sensitive time is therefore above ten
minutes. In conclusion, we expect that the sensitive time of the 50 cm CLOUD expansion
chamber is suﬃcient to observe droplet growth at all thermodynamic and water vapour
conditions of interest.

5.3 Electric ﬁeld and charged particle drift

We have made a preliminary study with the GARFIELD program [127] of the electric ﬁeld
produced by of the ﬁeld cage. The equipotentials are shown in Fig. 40 when the uppermost
electrode is set at +500 V and the piston at 0 V, and a linear voltage division is provided
for the intermediate electrodes. An electric ﬁeld of about 1000 Vm−1 is produced within
the chamber volume, and is suﬃciently uniform to perform the required functions, as
described in Section 4.2.6.

The drift velocity, vD [ms−1], of a particle with charge ne [C] in and electric ﬁeld E

[Vm−1] is given by

where µ [m2V−1s−1] is the electrical mobility and B [mN−1s−1] is the mechanical mobility.
Some values of these quantities for particles of various sizes are given in Table 6.

The drift characteristics of charged particles in this electric ﬁeld are shown in Fig.41.
Small ions can be eﬃciently cleared from the cloud chamber in about 2 s. Charged
aerosols, however, drift much more slowly. In the example shown, 10 nm-diameter aerosols
with unit electric charge are swept from the chamber in about 2 minutes. These large

diﬀerences in electrical mobility can be usefully applied as an experimental tool to provide,
for example, mobility measurements inside the chamber, or selective removal of light
charged particles while leaving heavier particles. Because of their low mobilities (Table 6),
aerosols larger than a few tens of µm in diameter are most eﬃciently cleared from the
cloud chamber either by activation and sedimentation or else by vacuum evacuation of
the chamber and then reﬁlling.

5.4 Diﬀusion eﬀects

5.4.1 Principles of diﬀusion

In the absence of an electric ﬁeld, ions and aerosol particles migrate through the cloud
chamber by diﬀusion and sedimentation (gravitational settling). The latter can be com-
pletely neglected for the size of aerosol particles under consideration. For example, a
0.1 µm diameter aerosol has a settling velocity of about 1 µm s−1 at stp.

The ions and aerosols will diﬀuse a projected distance

in a time t, where D [m2s−1] is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient. The diﬀusion coeﬃcient and the

xrms = √2Dt

67

mechanical mobility B are simply related:

D = kT B,

and B =

Cc
3πηd

where k [JK−1] is Boltzmann’s constant, T [K] is the temperature, η [Pa s] is the viscosity
of air and d [m] is the particle diameter. The quantity Cc is a dimensionless slip correction
factor [84] which is close to unity for particles above 1 µm diameter but increases in
magnitude for smaller particles. Values of these quantities for various sizes of particle are
given in Table 6.

5.4.2 Ion and aerosol losses to the walls

The ﬁnite size of the cloud chamber will result in the loss of charged particles and aerosols
to the walls by diﬀusion. When an aerosol touches a wall, it attaches by van der Waals
forces and is lost. For the purposes of the study described here we have also assumed that
a small ion is lost (or, equivalently, its charge is neutralised) if it collides with a wall.

for small ion concentrations of a few

We have estimated diﬀusional losses in the cloud chamber by a 2-dimensional Monte
Carlo simulation. Two atmospheric conditions were considered: a) standard conditions
(T = 293 K and P = 101 kPa), and b) 10 km altitude (223 K and 26 kPa).
In the
case of small ions (Figs. 42a and b), the ﬁducial region in the centre of the chamber
is unaﬀected for periods of about one minute for the 10 km conditions, and for longer
periods at ground level conditions. This is to be compared with ion-ion recombination
1000 cm−3) of
lifetimes in the atmosphere (i.e.
about 5 minutes or less (Section D.1). Since copious small ions can be replenished inside
the cloud chamber by the particle beam each 14.4 s of the PS accelerator cycle, these
losses of small ions can easily be accounted for and compensated. We also note that these
calculations assume small ions, whereas the actual mobilities of the ions will be reduced
due to the rapid attachment of molecules and conversion to complex ions (Appendix D).
Aerosols have much smaller mobilities than small ions (Table 6) and so they are
expected to be less aﬀected by wall losses. This can be seen in Figs. 42c) and d), which
show the losses of 10 nm-diameter aerosols after a period of 1 hr. The losses are relatively
modest, even for the 10 km conditions (the 50% loss region is a distance of about 2.5 cm
from the walls). Since the width of the loss region scales quite slowly with time as √t,
the cloud chamber dimensions are suﬃcient for measuring long aerosol growth processes
that may last several hours, without appreciable loss of aerosol particles. In summary,
therefore, we conclude that the 50 cm dimension for the cloud chamber is a suitable choice
from considerations of diﬀusional losses of ions and charged aerosols.

×

5.4.3 Diﬀusion of beam ionisation

We have also studied the diﬀusion of ionisation from the beam region of the cloud chamber.
The results of a 2-dimensional simulation (Fig. 43) indicate that distinct beam and no-
beam regions of the chamber exist only for exposure times less than about one minute.
Beyond that time, small ions will be spread throughout the chamber (although, if required,
they can be rapidly cleared in a few seconds by application of the clearing ﬁeld). Therefore

upper plots show the number density of small ions after a time t = 1 minute at a) 293 K
and 101 kPa (standard conditions) and b) 223 K and 26 kPa (10 km altitude). The
lower plots show the number density of 10 nm-diameter aerosols after a time of 1 hour
at c) 293 K and 101 kPa and d) 223 K and 26 kPa. A particle is assumed to be lost
if it touches one of the walls (which are located at the boundaries of the plots). The
initial charged particle distributions were generated uniformly in x and y in the range
0 < x, y < 50 cm. The contours indicate the fraction of the original number density of
particles remaining after the indicated times. The losses can be estimated at other times
by scaling the distance between a contour and its nearby wall as √t.

The initial charged particle distributions were generated according to the beam proﬁle: a
Gaussian distribution in the y projection, centred on y = 25 cm and with σy = 0.4 cm,
and a uniform distribution in the x projection. The contours indicate the number density
of charged particles after the indicated times. A ﬁgure of 100% corresponds to the original
particle density at t = 0, averaged over a 2-cm-wide bin centred on the beam axis (as
shown in panel a)).

small ion distributions were generated according to the beam proﬁle as described in the
caption for Fig. 43.

71

experiments that involve beam exposure times of more than about one minute will require
separate runs for the beam/no-beam measurements. We note that the charged particle
and ion proﬁles inside the chamber can be measured experimentally with deep piston
expansions that activate all particles and small ions into droplets.

In order to determine the beam intensity required to reproduce natural levels of ion-
isation, we have performed a 3-dimensional simulation including the eﬀects of ion-ion
recombination. Figures 44 c) and d) show that the ion-pair concentration in the region
around the beam about one minutes after a single pulse of 104 π/p is similar to the natural
103 i.p. cm−3, see Fig. 50). The eﬀects of
concentration at 15 km altitude (i.e. a few
ion-ion recombination losses can be seen by comparing the results at a factor 10 lower
beam intensity (Figs. 44 a) and b)), which indicate a smaller reduction (factor 7.5) in
ionisation concentration.

6 Data interpretation and cloud modelling

The purpose of these investigations is twofold. Firstly, we will use the laboratory results
to incorporate ion-mediated aerosol and cloud processes into models. Secondly, we wish to
establish whether the experimental results have important consequences for the behaviour
of aerosols and clouds in the atmosphere.

Although it is clear that atmospheric ion formation has the potential to inﬂuence
aerosol and cloud processes, the signiﬁcance of cosmic rays must be evaluated within the
natural variability of other parameters that inﬂuence aerosols and clouds. Ultimately,
modelling within the CLOUD project must address these issues and, speciﬁcally, should:

1. Obtain a quantitative understanding of the eﬀects of ionisation on aerosols and cloud
droplets, including ice formation. This will be achieved by comparing cloud chamber
and aerosol ﬂow chamber observations with simulations using both an aerosol and
a cloud microphysical box model.

With regard to aerosols:

2. Test the importance of ion eﬀects on aerosols under atmospheric conditions for
diﬀerent cosmic ray ﬂuxes and compare the magnitude of the ion eﬀect on aerosols
with the range of natural variations in other parameters. This will be achieved
by performing aerosol box model simulations under atmospheric conditions. This
work will focus particularly on the aerosol properties that are important for cloud
formation.

With regard to clouds:

3. Develop parameterisations of droplet activation and ice formation suitable for inclu-
sion in cloud models. This will be achieved by comparing box model simulations of
droplet activation and freezing with cloud chamber results.

4. Assess whether the direct eﬀect of cosmic rays on cloud droplets and ice nucleation
has a discernible eﬀect on cloud formation and development. This work will involve
simulations of diﬀerent cloud types under atmospheric conditions for a range of
cosmic ray ﬂuxes typical of their variation with altitude.

ion formation will be compared with natural variations in other parameters.

6.1 Modelling of aerosol processes

6.1.1 Evaluation of experimental results

Aerosol microphysical models will be used to simulate the formation, growth and coagu-
lation of aerosols measured by CLOUD. Radius-resolved models of H2SO4–H2O aerosols
including the processes of nucleation, coagulation, evaporation and condensation are ap-
propriate for this task. Such models exist at the University of Helsinki and the University
of Leeds. These models simulate the competition between condensation of H2SO4 on
existing aerosols and on new aerosols, leading to formation of stable clusters. A recent
study by Yu and Turco [5] has demonstrated the importance of air ions in the formation
of new aerosols in the natural environment, although the potentially important process
of attachment of air ions onto existing aerosols [128] was not considered. The magnitude
of such eﬀects remains uncertain and should be constrained in the models by comparison
with experimental results from CLOUD.

The models, including ion-mediated nucleation and coagulation, will be compared with
results from the cloud chamber and ﬂow chamber, with and without the simulated cosmic
ray source. According to Fig. 16, there are three processes that should be constrained in
model simulations of the experimental results:

Charge-enhanced nucleation: Experiments investigating ion eﬀects on nucleation
of H2SO4/H2O and H2SO4/H2O/NH3 aerosols will be carried out in the ﬂow chamber
and expansion chamber. The results will be compared with the classical ion-induced
nucleation theory. Possible enhancements with respect to the classical nucleation theory
will be parameterised in terms of gas concentrations, temperatures, and ionisation rates.

Charge-enhanced growth of nucleated clusters: The growth rate of freshly nu-
cleated clusters can be aﬀected by charges carried by the nuclei. The Helsinki group is
developing a theory for the enhancement of the condensation rate of H2SO4 molecules on
charged clusters due to ion-dipole interactions. The theory will be tested against growth
experiments carried out with the CLOUD apparatus.

Charge-enhanced coagulation of nucleated clusters: The freshly nucleated clus-
ters will coagulate within themselves and with larger (pre-existing) particles. The theory
for charge-enhanced coagulation is well established and can be tested by CLOUD. The
CLOUD results will be the ﬁrst to observe directly the coagulation rates of charged
nanometre aerosols.

6.1.2 Evaluation of atmospheric aerosol eﬀects

Simulation of the CLOUD observations will enable a model including ion-mediated aerosol
eﬀects to be validated. The next element of the work is to apply this model to atmo-
spheric conditions. While the experimental measurements will be performed under re-
alistic temperatures, pressures and atmospheric concentrations of H2SO4 and H2O, an

73

important missing element in the initial proposed programme is the inﬂuence of a larger
background-aerosol mode. Such a mode in reality will scavenge condensable vapours and
nucleated aerosols and suppress new particle formation. These eﬀects may require ex-
perimental study by CLOUD. Using a model to scale the rates of new aerosol formation
(determined by the beam intensity) to atmospheric conditions will be essential.

Idealised atmospheric box model simulations will be performed to study the inﬂuence
of several quantities that aﬀect the conversion of freshly nucleated particles into CCN
(Fig. 16):

1. H2SO4 concentrations. The H2SO4 concentration is determined by production from
oxidation of SO2 by OH radicals and loss due to scavenging and aerosol nucleation.
Realistic H2SO4 concentrations are therefore determined in a model simulation by
specifying the background aerosol surface area and SO2 and OH mixing ratios.

2. Background aerosols. A range of aerosol size distributions ranging between those
typical of the free troposphere, the pristine marine boundary layer and polluted
conditions will be used.

3. Humidity and temperature will be speciﬁed to be appropriate for the diﬀerent

atmospheric regions in item 2.

4. Ion source strengths vary between about 2 and 20 ion pairs/(cm3s) between the
boundary layer and the upper troposphere. Fluctuations in these source strengths
at each altitude will be tested.

5. Sensitivity to nucleation and coagulation rates . These quantities, determined
from the laboratory experiments, are likely to be uncertain and the eﬀect of this on
the calculations will need to be assessed.

Model simulations taking account of the full range of natural variations in the above
quantities will be performed to establish whether variations in the cosmic ray ﬂux are
likely to have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on aerosol processes. In particular, we wish to establish
whether there is an eﬀect on aerosols in the CCN size range of about 100 nm, and which
parts of the atmosphere are likely to be aﬀected the most.

6.2 Modelling of cloud processes

The planned experiments in the cloud chamber will yield data that can be applied directly
to numerical models of clouds. Two elements to a cloud modelling study based on these
experiments can be identiﬁed:

1. Detailed simulation of the cloud chamber results to constrain microphysical param-

eters aﬀected by ionisation.

2. Simulation of real clouds incorporating the eﬀects identiﬁed in item 1.

The simulation of real clouds should take particular account of the relative eﬀects of

cosmic rays against a background of other natural variations.

74

6.2.1 Simulation of cloud chamber results

The cloud chamber experiments will enable the eﬀect of ionisation on cloud droplet for-
mation and freezing to be studied under well controlled conditions. It should be noted
that the cloud formation processes in the chamber (principally droplet formation and
freezing) are considerably simpler than the complex interacting processes that govern
real cloud development (which include also coagulation, riming, sedimentation, droplet
breakup etc). This relative simplicity will enable the cloud chamber observations to be
compared with results of a highly simpliﬁed box model incorporating commonly used de-
scriptions of droplet formation and freezing. Comparisons with and without beam should
enable the eﬀects of air ions to be identiﬁed and parameterised in the models.

6.2.2 Simulation of real clouds

The purpose of this element of the work is to determine whether the properties of natural
clouds are sensitive to the eﬀects of cosmic ionisation. There are direct eﬀects and indirect
eﬀects that must be studied. The direct eﬀects include charge-enhanced CCN activation
into cloud droplets (Section 3.2.2) and ice nucleation (Section 3.2.4), while the indirect
eﬀect of interest is the charge-enhanced conversion of CN into CCN (Section 3.2.1).
In particular, we wish to examine the eﬀect on the following cloud properties:

1. Cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC);
2. Precipitation formation in non-glaciating and glaciating clouds19, which could inﬂu-

ence cloud lifetime;

3. Cloud reﬂectivity and cloud emissivity.

There have been numerous studies of the factors aﬀecting these cloud parameters. We
anticipate that the contribution of small changes in the mean ionisation state of the
atmosphere to the variance in these cloud properties will be small, though perhaps non-
negligible. We also cannot exclude that a signiﬁcant contribution to the variance could
arise due to large amplitude ﬂuctuations in ionisation rate.

We seek to understand whether ionisation variations are a statistically signiﬁcant con-
tributor to variations in these cloud properties. Our approach is to perform a Monte Carlo
simulation using two detailed cloud microphysical models, one simulating marine stratus
(the MISTRA model) and one simulating cumulus (described in the Appendix E). This
requires running the cloud models a number of times with uncertain input parameters
sampled at random from within appropriate ranges. Such a global stochastic approach
also allows the synergistic eﬀects between various input parameters to be determined. It
is also the most appropriate technique for examining the signiﬁcance of relatively minor
variations in a parameter of interest. The models we propose to use are suitable for the
calculation of these cloud properties but suﬃciently simple to enable multiple calculations.
The important model variables to include in such a Monte Carlo simulation include,
but are not restricted to, the following: Atmospheric thermodynamic state, which deter-
mines updraft velocities in clouds and entrainment rates and, in the case of stratus, the
depth of the mixed layer; temperature and speciﬁc humidity; time of day, which aﬀects
19Glaciating clouds are those in which ice formation occurs. Clouds in which this does not occur are

often termed “warm clouds”

75

radiative imbalance and entrainment at the top of marine stratus. To test the eﬀect
of perturbations to the CCN abundance (Section 3.2.1) we will use the output of the
aerosol models incorporating the charge-enhanced processes of nucleation, condensation
and coagulation.

Several important questions need to be addressed at the single cloud level. The results
of these detailed cloud resolving model studies could be parameterised for inclusion in
atmospheric general circulation models to assess global changes.

1. What is the eﬀect of aerosol changes on cloud droplet number densities and what
eﬀect does this have on cloud reﬂectivity (at solar wavelengths) and emissivity (in
the infrared)? Can modelled changes in cloud optical properties be seen in satellite
data? Cloud model studies will be needed using, as input, aerosol distributions
calculated from oﬀ-line aerosol microphysical models.

2. How do changes in cloud droplet number aﬀect the precipitation process in clouds?
Changes in the eﬃciency of precipitation will inﬂuence cloud lifetime and, hence,
on a statistical basis, average cloudiness. However, a direct relationship between
changes in precipitation rate and cloudiness will be diﬃcult to establish. The key
point here is to establish the direction and approximate magnitude of any change.

3. How do changes in the eﬃciency of ice formation aﬀect cloud thermodynamics (heat
transport) and precipitation eﬃciency? Increased eﬃciency of ice formation in an
individual cloud caused by a greater cosmic ray ﬂux might be expected to lead to in-
creased rainfall and decreased cloudiness, which would be opposite to the correlation
that has been observed.

7 Accelerator and beam

In principle there are alternatives to a particle accelerator beam for providing a source of
ionising radiation, such as UV or radioactive sources. However we consider that a particle
accelerator beam has several advantages and is the best choice. Firstly a few-GeV hadron
beam comprising protons and pions most closely duplicates the composition and energy
of the cosmic rays and hadronic showers found in the upper atmosphere. The known
timing of the beam pulse is also important for experiments such as ice nucleation where
expansions are necessary at a precise time either before or after the beam exposure.
A particle beam has the advantages that it is well collimated and easily traverses the
material of the windows and gases of the cloud chamber and ﬂow chamber, with negligible
scattering. Finally, the beam intensity is easily adjusted over a broad range and can be
measured precisely.

7.1 Experimental area

It is proposed to install CLOUD at the CERN PS (Proton Synchrotron) in the T11 sec-
ondary beamline of the East Hall. A preliminary study of the experimental installation
has been carried out (Fig. 45). The cloud chamber itself would be permanently installed
on the beamline for the duration of the experiment. However, to provide space for other

76

T11 beamline of the East Hall.

experiments to test detectors during periods when CLOUD is not running, we have de-
signed the ﬂow chamber to be dismountable from the beamline. The associated gas and
aerosol generation and analysis systems, together with the liquid cooling and hydraulic
systems, would be permanently installed near the apparatus. A dedicated counting room
for CLOUD is foreseen to be installed above the current T11 counting room.

7.2 Beam requirements

106 π/p per pulse (0.46 s duration). All lower
The T11 beamline can deliver up to
intensities can be delivered. We assume one pulse would be available for CLOUD per
supercycle (14.4 s). The T11 beam energy, which is selectable in the range
1–3.5 GeV,
matches the main part of cosmic ray spectrum . The transverse size of the beam at
7 mm2 FWHM) is well-suited to the detector
the detector (a minimum of about 7
requirements.

∼

×

We can compare the T11 beam with cosmic ray intensities in the upper troposphere
as follows. One pulse of 106 π/p deposits
107 ion-pairs cm−3 in air at a pressure
2
∼
corresponding to 15 km altitude. At this altitude the molecular number concentration
1018 cm−3, so a single beam pulse deposits about 4 pptv ion-pairs (and also
is about 5
produces about 6 pptv NO and OH molecules). This beam ﬂux is equivalent to about
105 s (5 days) of cosmic rays at 15 km altitude, and the initial ion-pair concentration
5
is about a factor 104 higher than at 15 km altitude. The diﬀerence in these two factors is
due to the ion lifetime in the atmosphere before recombination or scavenging, which is of
order 100 s.

·

·

·

77

After beam passage, the ion concentration in the beam region will fall due to diﬀusion
and to losses from ion-ion recombination and from scavenging by aerosols. The eﬀects
of diﬀusion and recombination have been simulated, as described in Section 5.4.3. The
results show that the ion-pair concentration in the region around the beam about one
minutes after a single pulse of 104 π/p is similar to the natural concentration at 15 km
altitude (i.e. a few

103 i.p. cm−3, see Fig. 50).

In summary, the T11 beam will allow a ﬂexible exposure for CLOUD, with time-
averaged ionisation cpncentrations ranging from below the natural level of cosmic rays
(with the use of the clearing ﬁeld) up to about a factor 100 times higher.

7.3 Beam counter system

The beam counter system (BCS) measures the particle beam intensity and its transverse
proﬁle. A telescope of plastic scintillation counters (T1, X1, Y1 and T2 in Fig. 26) mea-
60 mm2
sures the beam ﬂux. The dimensions of the counters are approximately 60
transversely and 8 mm thickness. A larger counter (H1) at the downstream end monitors
the beam halo. The counters X1 and Y1 are beam hodoscopes to measure the beam
proﬁle in the horizontal and vertical projections, respectively. They are constructed from
4 mm2 scintillator strips (or perhaps from scintillating ﬁbres), read out with multi-
4
anode phototubes, such as the Hamamatsu H6568/R5900-M16 with 4
4 photocathode
4 mm2. Scintillation counters will also be mounted above the cloud
pixels, each of size 4
chamber to tag the presence of cosmic rays during data taking (not shown in the ﬁgure).

8.1 Cost estimates and responsibilities

Table 7 summarises the cost estimates for CLOUD and the proposed responsibilities
of the collaborating partners. Following the standard CERN procedure, these ﬁnancial
responsibilities are to be considered as preliminary until they are agreed by the national
funding agencies. When ﬁnalised they will be enacted by signing a memorandum of
understanding between CERN and the collaborating institutes.

In addition to PS beam-time, the collaboration requests CERN provide the following:

1. Joint construction of the cloud chamber in collaboration with the Danish Space

Research Institute (DSRI). This concerns:

(a) Construction of subsystems for which CERN has special expertise, namely the
piston and hydraulic system (which duplicates the BEBC design) and the liquid
cooling system.

(b) Engineering design support for the cloud chamber and associated equipment.

2. Technical coordination of the overall experiment.

3. Experimental research group (research staﬀ and fellows).

4. Infrastructure support (oﬃces, lab space, experimental counting room, computing

support, etc.).

The present estimate of the total construction cost is 2300 kCHF (Table 7), assuming
an eﬃcient use of existing equipment and the recuperation of some materials and infras-
tructure equipment from previous, terminated experiments. These estimates are based on
delivered value on-site and do not include the technical infrastructure used in the home
institutes. Neither do the above estimates include manpower costs since they are ac-
counted for in the home laboratory infrastructure costs. Discussions are proceeding with
the national funding agencies in order to secure adequate home laboratory infrastructure
support for the experiment.

Plans are underway to apply for complementary funding from the European Union for
equipment support as well as to fund a number of Ph.D. students and research assistants
to participate in the experiment.

The annual maintenance and operation costs of CLOUD are estimated at 100 kCHF.
These cost would be paid by the collaborating institutes, including CERN, following the
standard CERN procedure. Since the total power consumption of the experiment is under
60 kW, the electricity costs are negligible.

8.2 Technical coordination

Technical coordination covers the following tasks:

Establishment of a master schedule linked to each institute’s own schedule, and
monitoring of the progress.

Management of all interfaces between the various components, and resolution of any
technical inconsistencies.

Management of the engineering data.

•

Concerning the last item, all relevant documents (technical speciﬁcations, engineering
and calculation notes, documents from manufacturers, etc.) would be organised within the
framework of the CERN EDMS (Engineering Data Management System). In particular,
the CDD (CERN Drawings Directory) software will be used to provide a central library
of all relevant drawings produced by the institutes or manufacturers. Once stored and
archived in the CDD, the drawings are available to all registered collaborators through
a web interface. The documents can be retrieved via the web and viewed under HPGL
(Hewlett Packard Graphical Language) format, which is the equivalent of Postscript for
technical drawings. Evolution of the detector design and the release of new technical
drawings can then be eﬃciently managed in a controlled and readily-accessible manner.

8.3 Milestones

Assuming the SPSC recommends approval of the experiment in May 2000, the detailed
design and prototyping will be ﬁnished by the end of 2000 and the construction will take
place in 2001. The initial checkout of the equipment with beam is expected to start in
March 2002. A preliminary estimate of the time required to complete the data taking is
about 3 years, but at present this should be considered as approximate.

9 Conclusion

We have joined together in an unprecedented team of atmospheric physicists, solar-
terrestrial physicists and particle physicists, to oﬀer CERN the opportunity to make
a major contribution to environmental science. Clouds are the engines of the weather,
yet they are only sketchily understood at the microphysical level. Now satellite obser-
vations give empirical evidence for an astonishing link between high-energy physics and
meteorology, namely that cosmic rays from the Galaxy may inﬂuence cloud formation and
behaviour.

If this link between cosmic rays and clouds is real, it provides a major mechanism for
climate change. During the 20th Century the cosmic rays reaching the Earth diminished
by about 15% as a result of increasing vigour in the solar wind, which scatters the cosmic
rays. The inferred reduction in cloud cover could have warmed the Earth by a large
fraction of the amount currently estimated to be due to man-made carbon dioxide. In
that case, the eﬀect of carbon dioxide may have been overestimated. If, on the other hand,
the link to cosmic rays proves to be illusory, present diplomatic eﬀorts to curb emissions
of carbon dioxide will be more strongly supported scientiﬁcally. Settling the issue, one
way or the other, is therefore an urgent task.

To ﬁnd out whether cosmic rays can aﬀect cloud formation, and if so how, we pro-
pose to simulate the cosmic rays with a beam of charged particles from CERN’s Proton
Synchrotron, in the CLOUD experiment. The beam will pass through a cloud chamber
where the atmosphere is to be represented realistically by moist air charged with conden-
sation nuclei and trace condensable vapours, and chilled by expansion. We shall be able
to compare processes when the beam is present and when it is not.

Our team brings to the planning of the CLOUD experiment a thorough knowledge of
atmospheric and cloud science, derived from ﬁeld and laboratory experiments, airborne
data-gathering, satellite observations, and microphysical theories. We also possess con-
siderable experience with cloud chambers and their optical readout, and with the mass
spectrometers and aerosol particle detectors required for chemical and physical analyses
of aerosols and ions. The design of the cloud chamber draws on CERN’s own experience,
notably with the Big European Bubble Chamber.

Space research has shown how ”big science” can make spectacular contributions to
knowledge of the environment by bringing together experts from diﬀerent disciplines. As
an analogous multidisciplinary team for particle physics, we do not claim total originality.
More than 100 years ago C.T.R. Wilson invented the cloud chamber to investigate weather
phenomena. It evolved into a prime instrument for particle physics. Now the wheel of
history turns and we go back to Wilson’s concept to investigate the possibility that the
Earth’s atmosphere acts like one big cloud chamber that echoes the whims of the Sun.

APPENDICES

In the following we provide some general background information on: cloud physics (Ap-
pendix A), aerosol-cloud-climate interactions (Appendix B), classical operation of a Wil-
son cloud chamber (Appendix C), cosmic rays in the atmosphere (Appendix D), and cloud
models (Appendix E).

A Cloud physics

A.1 General properties of clouds

Clouds are principally composed of ice and water, and in some cases they may contain
electriﬁed particles. High and low altitude clouds of limited vertical extent may contain
only one principal phase of liquid water or ice; for example, cirrus clouds in the upper
troposphere (altitudes greater than about 8 km) are composed principally of ice. Clouds
are often classiﬁed as stratiform or convective. The bulk properties of clouds have a
marked inﬂuence on climate, although whether clouds cause a net warming or cooling of
the atmosphere depends on the cloud properties and altitude.

Water vapour is eﬀectively a gaseous constituent of atmospheric air, and its concen-
tration can be determined by its gaseous partial pressure. At any given temperature there
is an associated maximum value of partial pressure due to water vapour, the saturation
vapour pressure. Air containing suﬃcient water vapour to generate the saturation vapour
pressure is said to be saturated, and has a relative humidity of 100%. Most natural clouds
form when air becomes saturated upon cooling, either adiabatically (cooling upon expan-
sion of rising air) or isobarically (e.g. by radiatively cooling near the ground, producing
fog). Occasionally it is possible for the saturation vapour pressure to be exceeded in lo-
calised regions, known as supersaturation (SS). In the atmosphere, this is never greater
than an excess relative humidity of few percent, due to the abundance of small particles
(or aerosol) on which the water can condense. Many diﬀerent kinds of aerosol are capable
of acting as condensation nuclei (CN) but it is the subset able to permit condensation
(activation) at atmospheric SS (cloud condensation nuclei, CCN) which are of greatest
interest for the formation of atmospheric clouds.

If the temperature is below 0◦C, liquid water droplets may persist in a thermodynami-
cally unstable supercooled state from which freezing may be readily initiated. Freezing can
be initiated by heterogeneous or homogeneous nucleation. In heterogeneous nucleation,
the supercooled water freezes in the presence of a suitable ice nucleus. Homogeneous nu-
cleation occurs if cooling is continued further, and all supercooled water in atmospheric
clouds becomes ice at about -40◦C by this process. Suitable ice nuclei are very rare in the
atmosphere, and it is certainly the case that only a very small (but variable) fraction of
the atmospheric aerosol is able to initiate ice. Consequently a signiﬁcant fraction of atmo-
spheric clouds contain supercooled water. At temperatures between about -5 and -10◦C,
ice multiplication processes can occur. When a particle freezes at these temperatures,
mechanical stresses during freezing lead to the ejection of small ice fragments, which in
turn act as eﬃcient ice nuclei.

The droplet number density in water clouds depends upon the cooling rate of air as

and p0 is the saturated vapour pressure over a plane surface of water at this temperature.
In the indicated example, an ambient water vapour SS of 0.15% (dashed line) exceeds
0.1 µm. These

aerosols will therefore activate and grow into cloud droplets, whereas smaller aerosols re-
main as unactivated haze particles. Droplets below their corresponding equilibrium curve
will shrink by evaporation whereas those above will grow by condensation (the indicated
droplets correspond, for example, to a dry diameter of 0.05 µm).

Activation of a CCN occurs when the water vapour SS exceeds a critical value. This
can be seen from the K¨ohler curves (Fig. 46), which show the equilibrium SS (and there-

Once activated, droplets grow by diﬀusion of water vapour. Diﬀusional growth is rather

83

slow and it is unusual for droplet radii to exceed 20–30 µm by this process. Cloud droplets
typically attain sizes of 10 µm within a few minutes but take over an hour to reach 100
r2/SS). Droplet collision and coalescence (which occurs when
µm (the growth time
droplets collide while falling under the inﬂuence of gravity) takes over as the principal
growth mechanism for radii greater than about 20 µm.

∝

For clouds to generate rainfall, some drops must grow to precipitable sizes of 1 mm
or greater. This is achieved not by diﬀusional growth of water droplets, but by collision
and coalescence of droplets or formation of ice (glaciation). Ice formation usually occurs
in only a small fraction of the cloud droplets, allowing these to grow by vapour diﬀu-
sion preferentially due to the lower vapour pressure of ice crystals compared with water
droplets. The ability of a cloud to generate rain is an important factor in determining its
lifetime.

Clouds have a high reﬂectivity at visible wavelengths and contribute signiﬁcantly to
the net albedo of the planet, reducing the net amount of radiation that is absorbed at
the Earth’s surface. Any changes in cloud reﬂectivity would therefore have potential
implications for the radiative balance of the climate system. Cloud reﬂectivity depends
on the mass of condensed water (termed the liquid water content), the depth of the cloud
and the droplet number density. Figure 47 shows the variation of cloud reﬂectivity with
cloud depth and cloud droplet number density for a ﬁxed liquid water content of 0.3 g m−3
(most data conﬁrm that there is little or no dependence of liquid water content on cloud
droplet number density). Any perturbation of cloud droplet number density by cosmic
rays could lead to changes in cloud reﬂectivity.

centration for a ﬁxed liquid water content of 0.3 g m−3 [130].

A.2 Aerosols and cloud condensation nuclei

Atmospheric aerosols are liquid or solid particles or clusters of molecules suspended in the
air. The atmosphere contains signiﬁcant concentrations of aerosols, sometimes as high as

84

106 cm−3, with diameters spanning over four orders of magnitude from a few nm to a 100
µm or so. Aerosols are often classiﬁed as either primary or secondary. Primary particles
are those injected directly into the air (e.g. by wind erosion, sea spray, pollen, etc). These
may be either of natural or anthropogenic origin. Secondary aerosols are those created
by gas-to-particle conversion of molecules (nucleation).

Aerosol composition varies widely depending upon geographical location and proxim-
ity to speciﬁc sources. It also varies signiﬁcantly across the size distribution, with the
smallest aerosols often being clusters of volatile species such as sulphuric acid and wa-
ter (formed from gas-to-particle conversion) and the largest often being inorganic salts
and dust particles. Although it is not possible to deﬁne a canonical aerosol distribution,
observations indicate that aerosol sizes can often be described by quasi-distinct modes.
For example, a typical remote continental aerosol (Fig. 48) is composed of a nucleation

a coarse mode (median radius

0.01 µm), an accumulation mode (median radius

Figure 48: Typical remote continental aerosol distributions: a) number, b) surface area
and c) volume [129].

The size and composition distribution are determined by many diﬀerent processes.
They include the following: nucleation of new particles at small sizes, formation of larger
primary particles, coagulation, deposition, condensation of soluble gases, phases changes
(e.g. crystallisation), in-cloud transformations and washout, and water uptake. Inorganic
aerosols are usually weakly acidic, with the most common aqueous cationic components
being H+, ammonium (NH+
4 ) and sodium, and with anionic components sulphate, chlo-
ride, nitrate. Such aerosols are hygroscopic. Aerosols can also be partly or wholly com-

85

posed of organic compounds derived from plant waxes and combustion sources. These
aerosols may be either hygrophobic or hygroscopic.

Nucleation of new aerosols is an important way in which anthropogenic emissions can
perturb the properties of aerosols. An important source of new aerosols is the oxidation
of sulphur dioxide in the presence of water vapour to give sulphuric acid, which readily
combines with water vapour to form new aerosols. This is believed to be primarily a ho-
mogeneous nucleation process, although atmospheric ions from cosmic rays may aﬀect the
rate of formation of new aerosols. The rate of nucleation is extremely diﬃcult to predict
from theory and must be measured in the laboratory under well-controlled conditions.

Hygroscopic aerosols serve as centres for the growth of cloud droplets. Such cloud
condensation nuclei (CCN) are normally aqueous acids or dissolved salts. Not all aerosols
grow into cloud droplets. The number that do depends on their composition, the SS
attained in the cloud, and the size distribution of aerosols competing for moisture. An
increased aerosol number density in general leads to an increased cloud droplet number
density.

A.3 Atmospheric electricity

Electric ﬁelds present in the atmosphere vary between fair weather values of typically
100 Vm−1 at the surface to about 100 kVm−1 in thunderstorms before a lightning dis-
charge. The atmospheric electric circuit, which involves a global current of 2000 A, is
thought to be sustained by thunderstorms continually active around the tropics. This
current between the ionosphere and the Earth’s surface ﬂows throughout the atmosphere,
in regions of disturbed and undisturbed weather, and is carried by vertical migration of
molecular ions.

The molecular ions (more traditionally known as small ions) are formed continuously in
the atmosphere by galactic cosmic rays (see Appendix D.1) and, close to the land surface,
also by natural radioactivity. The ions produced are rarely single species but clusters
of water molecules around a central ion. Typical atmospheric ion concentrations at low
altitudes in unpolluted air and ﬁne weather are about 500 ions cm−3, and vertical charge
ﬂuxes caused by conduction in fair weather conditions are typically 2 pA m−2 (
12 ions
cm−2s−1).
Ions are removed by self-recombination and by attachment to atmospheric
aerosols. Ion concentrations are generally lower in clouds than in clear air conditions due
to scavenging by droplets. Chemical diﬀerences between positive and negative ions leads
to a natural asymmetry in which the negative ions have a slightly higher (20%) electrical
mobility: this asymmetry leads to a small average charge on atmospheric particles.

∼

Electriﬁcation in disturbed weather (thunderstorms) is not completely understood
but is thought to result from ice-water interactions in thunderclouds, in which vertical
convective motions lead to diﬀerential transport of rising ice crystals and falling soft
hail. Their interaction leads to electriﬁcation, the sign and magnitude of charge exchange
depending on the temperature at which they interact which, in turn, is a function of
height. It has also been suggested that negatively-charged aerosols have faster activation
and growth than positive aerosols and that this may contribute to the charge-separation
mechanism in thunderclouds.

B Aerosol-cloud-climate interactions

The increased concentration of greenhouse gases such as water vapour, carbon dioxide and
methane may have large eﬀects on the Earth’s climate by enhancing the greenhouse eﬀect.
Much attention has also been paid to the possibility that the increased concentrations of
aerosol particles can have a cooling eﬀect on the global climate [131, 132, 133].

Clouds can aﬀect on electromagnetic radiation ﬂuxes in the Earth’s atmosphere by
scattering and absorption. Locally the net eﬀect is not very evident (e.g. because of
diﬀerent kinds of surfaces) [134]. According to measurements, however, the global net
eﬀect of today’s clouds on the climate is probably cooling [135] and thus opposite to the
eﬀect of greenhouse gases. The eﬀects of clouds on the radiation ﬂuxes depend on their
depth, liquid water content and cloud droplet size distribution [136] (Appendix A.1).

The formation and growth of cloud droplets occur on pre-existing aerosol particles.
The characteristics of the pre-existing particle distribution strongly aﬀect the developing
cloud droplet distribution. Field experiments show that the pre-existing aerosol particle
distribution is usually composed of mixed particles, i.e. particles including both hygro-
scopic and insoluble components [137, 138, 139]. According to recent model studies by
the Helsinki group [140, 141], the soluble mass of pre-existing aerosol particles is the most
important factor (other than dynamics) in determining the developing cloud droplet dis-
tribution. Hygroscopic material decreases the saturation vapour pressure of water vapour
above the surface of a solution droplet and makes the formation of a cloud droplet easier.
The condensation of diﬀerent gaseous substances on the aqueous particles during their
growth increases the hygroscopicity of the particles. When the amount of the hygroscopic
material in the particles increases it also decreases the critical supersaturation needed for
their activation to cloud droplets [121, 142] (see Fig. 46). It has been recently shown that
thin organic ﬁlms can also aﬀect the water vapour pressure above the growing droplet’s
surface and thus inﬂuence cloud droplet formation [143].

The amount of water vapour available during the growth process depends on various
dynamical aspects and on the particle size distribution. When an air parcel exceeds 100%
relative humidity the most hygroscopic particles activate ﬁrst and start to consume water
vapour. The maximum supersaturation achieved is therefore smaller when there is a
larger amount of soluble material in the nascent aerosols. Condensation of some strongly
hygroscopic gaseous substances on the particles simultaneously with water vapour can
allow a larger fraction of the pre-existing particle distribution to grow to cloud droplets.
Recently we have investigated the eﬀects of changing hygroscopicity (the availability of
condensable material in the gas phase) on the formation of cloud droplets [144, 145]. In the
simulation, water (H2O), nitric acid (HNO3), hydrochloric acid (HCl) and ammonia (NH3)
vapours condense on mixed particles composed of ammonium sulphate ((NH4)2SO4) and
an insoluble substance. In order to take into account the dynamical aspects, we used an
adiabatic air parcel model [121]. The initial mean radii, standard deviations and number
concentrations as well as the fraction of soluble salt in the particles and the concentration
of gaseous HNO3, HCl and NH3 in ambient air are varied about their observed values in
marine and continental air (Table 9). The Helsinki group has also investigated how the
optical thickness of the simulated clouds varies as a function of initial ratio of acid and
ammonia mixing ratios.

Our simulations conﬁrm that gas phase hygroscopicity has a large eﬀect on the forma-

tion and properties of clouds [144, 145]. The K¨ohler curves are also modiﬁed [146, 147]. In
general, this study shows that the increase in hygroscopicity of growing droplets implies
an increasing number of cloud droplets and increasing optical thickness of a cloud. The
way in which the soluble mass is distributed among aerosol particles and between the size
modes also seems to be important [148]. When condensed on aqueous solution droplets,
nitric and hydrochloric acids enhance the activation of cloud droplets. This is also the
case when no other condensable trace gases present. In contrast, ammonia alone cannot
enhance the number of activated cloud droplets signiﬁcantly. But in real atmospheric
situations where particles also take up strong acids, ammonia has a clear increasing in-
ﬂuence on the activation of cloud droplets. This is due to the fact that larger amounts of
free hydrogen ions enhance the formation of ammonium ions signiﬁcantly. On the other
hand condensed ammonia neutralises the solution droplets eﬃciently, which allows larger
amounts of condensable acids to be taken up.

We have also studied how the optical properties of the resulting cloud droplet distri-
bution vary with changing hygroscopicity. The change of optical thickness is usually very
large (the maximum ∆τ /τ is 1.6, where τ is the optical thickness). This is the case even
at moderate concentrations, for example ∆τ /τ is around 0.5 when the sum of acids is
1 ppbv and ammonia is 1 ppbv. This change in optical thickness means that the albedo
of an individual cloud may change signiﬁcantly. In summary, therefore, it is important
to estimate the global indirect forcing due to the eﬀect of condensable gases on cloud
droplet formation, and to understand the possible inﬂuence of galactic cosmic rays on
this process.

C Classical operation of a Wilson cloud chamber

The principle of classical operation of a Wilson cloud chamber [70, 149] for the detection of
charged particles can be understood from Fig. 49 which shows the water vapour pressure
equilibrium curves for small droplets carrying a charge Qe:

R the gas constant, T the absolute temperature, γ the surface tension, M the molecular

weight, ρ the density, ǫ0 the permittivity of free space and r the radius of the droplet.
The curves divide an upper region of vapour pressure in which water droplets grow by
condensation (e.g. droplet D1 in Fig. 49) from a lower region where they shrink by
evaporation (e.g. D2).

Figure 49: Thomson-Kelvin curves showing the equilibrium saturation ratio for charged
droplets of pure water at 273 K. The curves are labelled according to the droplet electronic
charge, Qe. The saturated vapour pressure, p0, corresponds to equilibrium with a plane
water surface (0% supersaturation). Droplets formed in the region above the curves will
grow (condensation region) while those below will shrink (evaporation region).

The curves are similar in shape to the K¨ohler curves for the equilibrium vapour pres-
sure over aerosol-nucleated droplets, but much higher supersaturations are required for
activation of charged droplets of pure water (compare Fig. 46 with the right-hand scale
of Fig. 49). The (purely electrostatic) inﬂuence of droplet charge is signiﬁcant only for
1 nm. To set this scale, the eﬀective radius of one water molecule is
very small radii
0.2 nm and a droplet of radius 0.5 nm contains about 18 molecules. The charge re-
∼
duces the equilibrium water vapour pressure by an increased attraction of the polar water
molecules. Evidence suggests that negative ions form larger condensation nuclei than
do positive ions, and hence the former activate more rapidly and at lower water vapour
supersaturations.

∼

The necessary supersaturation in a cloud chamber is generated by fast adiabatic ex-

pansion. For an ideal gas and an adiabatic expansion,

where γ is the ratio of speciﬁc heats CP /CV (1.40 for air and saturated water vapour).
For example, when a mixture of air and saturated water vapour at 1 atmosphere and
293 K is adiabatically expanded by a large volume ratio V2/V1 = 1.3, the temperature

falls to 264 K and the resultant saturation ratio is 5.9 (i.e. 490% supersaturation). Under
these conditions all small ions (Q
1) are activated and rapidly grow to visible droplets.
In contrast, very small adiabatic expansions are required to generate the low supersat-
0.1% found in the atmosphere (Fig. 46). For example, a 100 µm piston
urations of a few
movement of the CLOUD expansion chamber at one atmosphere and 293 K gives a volume
10−4. This
expansion ratio dV /V = 2.0
reduces the gas temperature by 0.023 K and produces a supersaturation of 0.12%. These
considerations set the required temperature stability of 0.01 K for the CLOUD expansion
chamber.

intensities vary between about 0.8 and 2.3 cm−2s−1, depending on geomagnetic latitude

density for minimum-ionising charged particles is 68 ion-pairs cm−1. At high altitudes
the fraction of heavily-ionising non-relativistic particles becomes signiﬁcant and the mean
ionisation density is about 110 ion-pairs cm−1, corrected to 1 atmosphere pressure [150].

At 15 km the density of air is 0.20
therefore about 18 ion-pairs cm−1 per charged particle. Therefore the ion-pair production

rate by cosmic rays at 15 km altitude is q = 18
on geomagnetic latitude. Free radicals are also created by galactic cosmic rays and these
may lead to chemically-reactive molecules. As examples, about 1–2 OH radicals [53] and
1.5 NO molecules [55, 56, 57] are estimated to be produced per ion-pair. Mixing ratios of
about 0.7 pptv OH or NO are therefore generated by cosmic rays per day in the upper
troposphere.

leading to H+B(H2O)n. An important example for B is acetone (CH3)2CO (proton aﬃn-
ity: 194 kcal/mol). Negative ions react with acidic molecules, particularly HNO3 and
H2SO4, leading to NO−

been observed in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere by aircraft-based ion mass
spectrometers [152, 62].

Figure 50b) shows that the maximum light ion concentration occurs at an altitude of
about 17 km, and the concentration at 8–9 km is about a factor of two lower. Since the
troposphere has a depth of about 18 km over the tropics, decreasing to about 8 km over
the poles, this indicates that between one third and one half of the total ionisation from
galactic cosmic rays is deposited directly in the troposphere, depending on latitude.

≃

From Eq. 7, the recombination lifetime of an ion is τ

1/(αn). This implies ion
lifetimes of about 3–9 min. Additional loss mechanisms, such as aerosol attachment, will
reduce the actual lifetime. The ions drift vertically in the electric ﬁeld created by the
negatively-charged Earth and the positively-charged ionosphere. The ﬁeld strength is
100 V/m at sea level, producing an drift velocity for small ions of about 1.5 cm s−1.

At an altitude of 15 km, however, E
2 V/m due to the higher conductivity of the air,
and the drift velocity is only 0.1 cm s−1 This results in an ion drift distance at 15 km
altitude of only 0.4–1.0 m before recombination. The ions and free radicals produced
by cosmic radiation will in general be transported substantially further by tropospheric
dynamics, both vertically and horizontally.

D.2 Atmospheric measurements of cosmic rays

We present here a summary of the regular balloon cosmic ray (CR) observations started by
Lebedev Physical Institute in the former Soviet Union in 1957. The cosmic ray monitoring
in the atmosphere consists of the launching of small rubber balloons, each carrying a
special radiosonde and a charged particle detector [153, 154].

The charged particle detector comprises two cylindrical Geiger counters, each of 9.8 cm
length and 1.8 cm diameter, and with steel walls of 0.05 g cm−2 thickness. The counters
are arranged in a vertical telescope with their axes separated by 2.7 cm and a 7 mm
(2 g cm−2) Al ﬁlter inserted between them. A single counter provides the omnidirectional
ﬂux of charged particles: electrons with energy Ee > 0.2 MeV and protons with Ep > 5
MeV. A coincidence of the two counters records the vertical ﬂux of charged particles within
a solid angle of about 1 sr: electrons with Ee > 5 MeV and protons with Ep > 30 MeV.
Both the omnidirectional and vertical ﬂuxes of charged particles in the atmosphere are
measured simultaneously. A radio pulse caused by a charged particle passing through one
or both counters is transmitted to a ground-level receiver. In addition, the air pressure
(atmospheric depth) is measured by a special barometric sensor. In this way the charged
particle counting rates versus atmospheric depth are recorded. Measurements are made
continuously from ground level up to altitudes of 30–35 km.

The monitoring stations for the long-term cosmic ray study are summarised in Ta-
ble 10. Balloon launches are made almost every day at these sites, and have been con-
tinuously for about 40 years. Despite the diﬀerence in their geomagnetic cutoﬀ rigidities,
Rc, the measured intensities at Mirny and Murmansk are essentially equal to each other
because of the atmospheric material cutoﬀ, which is higher than Rc at these latitudes.

Figure 51 shows a typical measurement of CR transition curves in the atmosphere
obtained two years before a solar maximum (cosmic ray minimum). The data obtained
during quiet geomagnetic conditions show the secondary ﬂux in the atmosphere originating
from galactic CR’s alone. The secondary CR ﬂuxes grow with increasing altitude until

they reach a maximum (which is known as the Pfotzer maximum, Nmax) at 16–25 km.
The value of Nmax depends on the geomagnetic latitude and phase of the solar activity
cycle. The counting rates are substantially increased in the upper atmosphere at times
of special events such as solar particle events, coronal mass ejections, energetic electron
precipitations, radioactive clouds, etc.

While propagating inside the heliosphere, the GCR intensity is modulated by solar
activity. The balloon CR observation provide experimental data over 4 cycles of solar
activity for the study of long-term modulation of GCR’s and its eﬀects on atmospheric
phenomena. Figure 52 shows the monthly-averaged Pfotzer maxima measured with the
omnidirectional counter at the sites of permanent launchings. The main feature of the
GCR intensity is the 11-year solar cycle. It is seen that the amplitude of the solar cycle
modulation depends strongly on Rc, being up to 70% at the polar stations, 30% at Moscow
and about 10% at Alma-Ata. These data also provide evidence for a systematic decrease
of cosmic ray intensity over the last 40 years (Table 2) [37].

To study the global distribution of CR in the atmosphere we carried out latitude
surveys of CR ﬂuxes in the atmosphere. Such a surveys were fulﬁlled during the sea
expeditions in 1962–1965, 1968–1971, 1975–1976, 1979–1980 and in 1987. The measure-
ments covered the Rc range from 0.03 to 15–17 GeV/c [155, 156]. In Figure 53 we give
an example of the CR transition curves obtained at diﬀerent latitudes in the northern
and southern hemispheres during the 1987 solar minimum (cosmic ray maximum). Each
curve averages the data from the omnidirectional counter recorded over several radiosonde
ﬂights. The ratio of Nmax at polar latitudes to its value at the equator is about a factor
3.6.

E Cloud models

Marine stratus cloud model: The MISTRA (microphysical stratus) model [157] is a
one-dimensional model of stratus clouds including a detailed treatment of size-segregated
aerosol and cloud microphysical processes, which is essential in this study. Aerosols and
cloud are treated either in a 2-dimensional particle distribution or as internal mixtures
with 40 aerosol and 50 droplet size class. The hygroscopic growth and evaporation of
aerosols in sub-saturated air and their activation to form droplets are explicitly calculated
by solving the droplet growth equation for all droplets at all humidities. Coalescence of
droplets necessary for the simulation of warm rain is included [158]. The model has a
vertical resolution of 10 m from ground level to 1 km (spanning the cloud level), a further
50 logarithmically spaced grid levels up to 2 km (to treat dynamics and radiative transfer
only) and a homogeneous layer up to 50 km (for radiative transfer only). Entrainment
of aerosols is accounted for using a turbulent kinetic energy closure scheme. Radiative
transfer is treated using a δ-two stream approximation (12 broad-band intervals from
4–100 µm and 6 intervals from 0.2–4 µm).

Cumulus cloud model: Cumulus clouds will be simulated using a two-dimensional
slab-symmetric non-hydrostatic cloud model including detailed cloud microphysics. Four
hydrometeor classes are considered: water drops,
ice crystals, graupel particles and
snowﬂakes (aggregates of ice crystals). The warm microphysical processes included are

95

nucleation of CCN, condensation and evaporation, collision-coalescence, binary breakup,
and sedimentation. The ice microphysical processes included are drop freezing, ice nucle-
ation (deposition and condensation-freezing, and contact nucleation), ice multiplication,
deposition and sublimation of ice, interactions of ice-ice and ice-drop (aggregation, ac-
cretion and riming), melting of ice particles, and sedimentation of ice particles. All the
microphysical processes are formulated as kinetic equations and solved using the method
of Multi-Moments [159]–[162].

Each type of particle is divided into 34 bins with mass doubling for connected bins.
The masses at the beginning of the ﬁrst bin and the end of last bin for both liquid and
10−3 kg, which correspond to drop diameters of
solid phases are 0.160
3.13 and 8060 µm, respectively.

This model has been used in studies concerning the eﬀect of natural and artiﬁcial large
and giant CCN on development of cloud particles and precipitation in convective clouds
(e.g. refs. [163, 164]). It is currently being extended to include the evolution of aerosols
inside various hydrometeors in order to study the venting of trace gases and aerosols by
convective clouds.

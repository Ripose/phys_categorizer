Abstract

We report on the retrieval of directional sea-roughness (the full directional mean square slope, including
MSS, direction and isotropy) through inversion of Global Navigation Satellite System Reﬂections (GNSS-
R) and SOlar REﬂectance Speculometry (SORES) data collected during an experimental ﬂight at 1000 m.
The emphasis is on the utilization of the entire Delay-Doppler Map (for GNSS-R) or Tilt Azimuth Map (for
SORES) in order to infer these directional parameters. Obtained estimations are analyzed and compared to
Jason-1 measurements and the ECMWF numerical weather model.

Keywords: GNSS-R, GPS, Galileo, Speculometry, SORES, sea roughness, Directional Mean Square
Slope, Delay-Doppler Map.

Introduction

The use of Global Navigation Satellite System
(GNSS) signals reﬂected by the sea surface as a
remote sensing tool has generated considerable at-
tention for over a decade [12, 13]. Among sev-
eral applications, two classes have rapidly emerged
in the community:
sea-surface altimetry, which
aims at retrieving the mean sea level like classical
radar altimeters do, and sea-surface scatterometry or
“speculometry” (see below for a justiﬁcation of this
neologism) for the determination of sea roughness
and near surface wind. This paper addresses the lat-
ter application.

Inferring sea roughness from GNSS-R data re-
quires (i) a parametric description of the sea surface,
(ii) an electromagnetic model for sea-surface scat-
tering at L-band and (iii) the choice of a GNSS-R
data product to be inverted. In the literature, there
It
is quite an agreement on the two ﬁrst aspects.
has been recognized that the scattering of GNSS
signals can be modeled as a Geometric Optics pro-
cess (GO), where the fundamental physical process
is the scattering from mirror-like surface elements.
This is the reason why we use the term “speculome-
try”, from the latin word for mirror, speculo. There-
fore, the most important feature of the sea surface

is the statistics of facet slopes at about the same
scale as the electromagnetic wavelength (λ). This
is described by the bi-dimensional slope probabil-
ity density function (PDF). Under a Gaussian as-
sumption, three parameters sufﬁce to fully deﬁne the
sea-surface PDF: the directional mean square slope
DMSSλ, which results from the integration of the
ocean energy spectrum at wavelengths larger than λ.
The symbol DMSSλ englobes the three parameters
deﬁning the ellipsoidal shape of the slope PDF: scale
(total MSS), direction (Slope PDF azimuth) and
isotropy (Slope PDF isotropy). The GNSS-R scat-
tering model proposed by Zavorotny and Voronovich
in [17] is based on GO, and is, to date, the refer-
ence model for the GNSS-R community. While for
the purposes of specular scattering the sea-surface
roughness is parametrized by the directional mean
square slope in a direct manner, DMSSλ is rarely
emphasized as the geophysical parameter of interest.
Instead, most authors prefer to link sea roughness
to the near surface wind vector, which is thought to
be more useful for oceanographic and meteorologi-
cal users, but misleading. Indeed, this link requires
an additional modeling layer and is an extra source
of error. For instance, a wind-driven sea spectra is
not suitable for inferring sea surface DMSSλ when
swell is present or the sea not fully developed. The

connection between DMSSλ and wind is thus mod-
ulated by other factors (e.g., swell, fetch and degree
of maturity).

Usually, for technical reasons, the product in-
verted in GNSS-R speculometry is a simple De-
lay Waveform, that is, a 1D delay map of the re-
ﬂected signal amplitude. Using a single GNSS
emitter, the wind speed can be inferred assuming
an isotropic slope PDF (i.e., the PDF’s shape is a
circle) [8, 3, 11]. Attempts have also been made
to measure the wind direction by ﬁxing the PDF
isotropy to some theoretical value (around 0.7) and
using at least two satellites reﬂections with differ-
ent azimuths [18, 9]. As investigated in the frame
of the ESA OPPSCAT project (see [1] and [14]),
it is nonetheless possible to work on a product of
higher information content: the Delay-Doppler Map
(DDM), a 2D delay-Doppler map of the reﬂected
signal amplitude. The provision of an extra dimen-
sion opens the possibility to perform the full estima-
tion of the DMSSλ. In [7], Elfouhaily et al. devel-
oped a rapid but sub-optimal method based on the
moments of the DDM to estimate the full DMSSλ:
this approach neglects the impact of the bistatic
Woodward Ambiguity Function modulation of the
Delay Doppler return.

The present paper was motivated by a recent ex-
periment conducted by Starlab for the demonstration
of GNSS-R altimetry. The altimetric aspects are re-
ported elsewhere [15]. We note that the conﬁgura-
tion of the ﬂight was not optimized for speculom-
etry: from 1000 m altitude, the sea-surface reﬂec-
tive area is essentially limited by the PRN C/A code,
and the glistening zone is coarsely delay-Doppler
mapped.
In addition to the GNSS-R experiment,
high resolution optical photographs of sun glitter
were also taken, providing the SORES dataset (SO-
lar REﬂectance Speculometer). Since the classic
study of Cox and Munk [4], it is well known that
sea-surface DMSSOpt can be inferred from such
data. The availability of optical photographs thus
provided us with an extra source of colocated infor-
mation. Because there is a strong similarity between
products —DDM for GNSS-R and the Tilt Azimuth
Map (TAM) for SORES— and models —GO— the
same inversion methodology can be applied to both
datasets.

The goal of the paper is to investigate the full
exploitation of the bidimensional GNSS-R DDM
and SORES TAM products to infer the set of three
DMSSλ parameters. The driver of the study has
been the exhaustive exploitation of the information

contained in those 2D products. Consequently, the
proposed approach relies on a least-square ﬁt of
speculometric models to datasets. We ﬁrst describe
in details the collected datasets and the associated
pre-processing. Then, we present the speculometric
models needed to infer data together with the inver-
sion scheme. Finally, we provide the estimation re-
sults and discuss their coherence with other sources
of data.

The campaign took place Friday September 27th
2002 around 10:00 UTC, along the Catalan coast
from Barcelona (Spain) up to the French border. An
aircraft overﬂew the Jason-1 track 187 at 1000 m
along 150 km and gathered 1.5 hours of GPS-R raw
signals (see [16] for more details). Since it would
have been computationaly too expensive to process
the full track, it was divided into 46 10-second arcs
(each spanning roughly 500 meters), sampled every
50 s (see Figure 1). The ﬁrst arc started at GPS
Second Of the Week 468008.63. The aircraft kine-
matic parameters were kept close to the nominal val-
ues speciﬁed in the mission plan: altitude=1000 m,
speed=50 m/s and heading from North=30o. We
have selected three GPS satellites in optimal view
during the experiment whose elevation and azimuth
are given in Figure 2.

The raw GNSS-R data were recorded using the
GPS reﬂection equipment provided by ESA. Specif-
ically, the GPS direct and reﬂected signals were 1-
bit sampled and stored a rate of 20.456 Mbit/s. The
pre-processing step consisted in performing a delay-
Doppler Pseudo Random Noise (PRN) code de-
spreading to coherently detect the direct signal (from
GPS emitter) and the reﬂected signal (scattered by
sea-surface). We used the Starlab in-house soft-
ware to produce three DDMs time-series (one per
PRN), sampled into 46 arcs of 10 seconds each. The
general processing strategy was to track the delay-
Doppler of direct signal and then compute DDMs for
both direct and reﬂected signals. These DDMs ac-
tually represent the ﬁltered electromagnetic ﬁeld of
incoming signals, as processed with delay-Doppler
value slightly different from those corresponding to
the specular point. The coherent integration time
was set to 20 ms to ensure a Doppler resolution of
50 Hz. The delay map spanned 80 correlation lags
(i.e. +/- 1.95 µs) with a lag step of 48.9 ns, while the

Doppler range spans -200 Hz to 200 Hz with a step

arc (the accumulation time was set to 10 s). This
process aimed at reducing both thermal and speckle

R product for one PRN and one arc was an average

The SORES photographs were taken from time
to time along the track when the roll, pitch and yaw
angles of the plane were negligible. The camera
was a Leica dedicated to aerial photography. An
inertial system (by Applanix) provided the time-
tagged position for each snapshot. The ﬁlm was a
panchromatic Aviphot Pan 80. The focal length was
15.2 cm, and the photographic plate had an area of
23 cm2. The aperture angle was consequently

3. Models and inversion

3.1. Directional mean square slope

As discussed above, forward scattered signals at
short wavelengths (optical but also L-band) are
mostly sensitive to the specular scattering mecha-
nism. Therefore, the strongest sea-surface signa-
ture in received signal is expected to be due to facet

probability density function (PDF) Gaussian model

where s† = [∂ζ/∂x ∂ζ/∂y] stands for the vector

the matrix of slope second order moments. The xy
frame mapped on sea-surface is deﬁned as follows:
it is centred on the specular point and has its x axis
aligned with the Transmitter-Receiver line. Mean-
square slopes along major and minor principal axes
are often referred to as MSS up-wind (mssu) and
MSS cross-wind (mssc) respectively. The K matrix
is then obtained via a simple rotation,

where Rψ is the usual rotation matrix of angle ψ,

axis.

Thus, mssu, mssc and ψ are the three geophys-
ical parameters we wish to estimate. They can be
thought of as the three parameters of an ellipse (see
Figure 3) representing the slope PDF mapped on
sea-surface. In the following, we will consider the
equivalent set of parameters:

Total MSS, deﬁned as: 2√mssu.mssc. This
magnitude is actually proportional to ellipse
area and can be interpreted in terms of wind
speed, based on a particular wind-driven sea-
surface spectrum like the Elfouhaily’s spec-
trum [6].

direction of semi-major axis with respect

Slope PDF isotropy (SPI), deﬁned as
mssc/mssu. When SPI=1, the slope PDF
is isotropic and the glistening zone is circular.
Low values of SPI indicate a highly directive
PDF. Typically, SPI is expected to be around
0.65 for well developed sea-surface.

The presence of thermal noise biases the value of
average power return. Hence, the average amplitude
of the DDM can by modeled by

where b stands for the bias in power. In particular,
this effect is visible in the early-delay domain of the
DDM: for delays lower than one-chip, the DDM am-
plitude has a no null value, often called ”grass level”.
As we do not have a calibrated model an overall scal-
ing parameter α is also needed in the model.

To sum up, the model features three parameters

of interest and four “nuisance parameters”:

the DMSSλ, characterizing the Gaussian
slope PDF: total MSS, isotropy (SPI) and az-
imuth (SPA),

The pixel intensity on the image comes princi-

cles beneath the sea surface is assumed negligible
and is not considered here. A model has been de-
veloped to remove reﬂections of sky radiance from
the glint. The approach consists in considering each
sea surface facet specular because, for a given loca-
tion of the receiver, there always exists a “source”
in the sky satisfying the specular reﬂection condi-
tion. Let’s consider the cell (αi, βi) of the TAM. It
corresponds to the slope components required to re-
ﬂect the solar rays onto the camera. The radiance of
the sea surface due to reﬂected skylight in the cell

Inversion scheme

Inversion was performed through a minimization
of the root mean square difference between model
and data products (i.e., DDMs for GNSS-R and
TAMs for SORES). Numerical optimization was
carried out with a steepest-slope-descent algorithm
(Levenberg-Marquardt type adjustment). The three

2003WorkshoponOceanographywithGNSSReﬂections

DMSSλ as well as nuisance parameters (τc, fc and
α for the DDMs and A0 and K for the TAMs)
were jointly estimated in an iterative manner: nui-
sance parameters (as a ﬁrst step) and DMSSλ (as a
second step) were successively optimized, repeating
this two-step sequence until convergence. Figure 6
gives qualitative examples of ﬁt results for DDM and
TAM.

4. Results and discussion

Figure 7 shows total MSS, Slope PDF Azimuth
and Slope PDF Isotropy along the aircraft track be-
tween latitudes 41.2o and 42.2o, as estimated by
SORES and GNSS-R. Other sources of information
are also shown for comparison:

set κ=0.45 and κ=0.95 for C- and Ku-band respec-
tively.

4.2. Slope PDF Azimuth

Using a single DDM, the estimation of SPA is de-
generate in two particular cases: when the transmit-
ter is at zenith or when the receiver moves torwards
the transmitter [2]. In these two cases, the Delay-
Doppler lines that map the glistening zone are sym-
metric around the receiver direction. Hence, one
cannot distinguish between a slope PDF and its mir-
ror image about the receiver direction. Here, PRN08
has its elevation comprised between 74 and 83 de-
grees. It is then very likely that the SPA estimated
for this PRN is degenerate. For this reason, we have
added on the plot the mirror image of the SPA about
the receiver direction (30o). We also note that the az-
imuth of PRN10 decreases down to 230o at the end
of the track, quite close from 210o, the complemen-
tary of the receiver’s direction.

According to ECMWF data and SORES spectral
analysis, wind and swell were slightly misaligned.
PRN08 (or its mirror image) matches very well the
swell direction and so does PRN10 along most of
the track. This result underlines the fact that GNSS-
R is not sensitive to wind only and that swell has a
strong impact too. PRN24 has a different behaviour,
in line with SORES. These two measurements agree
relatively better with wind direction, although a dis-
crepancy of 30o is observed at the beginning of the
track.

4.3. Slope PDF Isotropy

The total MSS has been plotted in log-scale in order
to compare different frequency measurements more
easily. The common trend for all bands is the in-
crease of slope variance with latitude until a relative
plateau is reached. Measurements of PRN08 and
24 show good agreement while PRN10 seems to be
somewhat up-shifted. As expected, we observe that
the level and dynamic of MSS decrease with longer
wavelength: Optical, Ku, C and L band, in this or-
der. Nevertheless, the level and dynamic range of
GNSS-R plots (especially PRN10) seem a bit large
for L-band measurements, when compared to C-
band. Note however that Jason-1’s MSS have been
obtained through the relationship M SS = κ/σo,
κ being an empirical parameter accounting for cal-
ibration offsets. Unfortunately, the uncertainty on
κ makes the absolute levels of Jason-1’s plots very
On Figure 8, we have plotted the estimated total
MSS versus Jason-1’s wind speed ∗ together with
doubtful. Here, as an illustration purpose, we have
∗The Jason-1 wind speed is derived from Ku-band σo and signiﬁcant wave height, using the algorithm described in [10]. Its stated
accuracy is 2 m/s.

It is worth remembering that Elfouhaily’s wind-
driven spectrum predicts a SPI value of 0.65, hardly
sensitive to wind speed. Here we note that SPI varies
quite signiﬁcantly along the track for both GNSS-
R and SORES. The important departure observed
from the 0.65 nominal value is probably a signa-
ture of an under-developed sea and the presence of
strong swell. Further research should be undertaken
in order to better understand the potential informa-
tion contained in this product.

We see that both SORES and GNSS-R estimations
follow Elfouhaily’s model trend (MSS obtained by
integrating the spectrum with the usual cut-off of 3
times the wavelength) but give higher values of MSS
(from to 20 to 40% up-shifted). Actually, we have
found that MSS estimates of PRN08 and 24 are very
well ﬁtted by Elfouhaily’s spectrum with a cut-off of
one wavelength only. The 20% discrepancy can be
explained by a strong sea state with a SWH twice as
high as the one observed during the Cox and Munk’s
experiment (almost 2 m compared to 1 m). At any
rate, these results indicate that the wind-MSS link
is not straightforward and that the DMSSλ should
be considered as a self-standing product for oceano-
graphic users.

and SPA are deﬁnitely affected by swell. Quantita-
tively, the 20 % bias observed in SORES results can
be explained by the impact of swell on the elevation
spectrum. Consequently, DMSSλ can and should be
studied as an independent parameter, of independent
geophysical value. We note however that the use of
several wavelenghts could in principle be used to in-
vert for all the parameters modulating the elevation
spectrum, a line of future work.

Let us ﬁnally emphasize that the ﬂight was not
optimized for speculometry (1000 m altitude, 50 m/s
speed) and that higher/faster ﬂights are needed in the
future in order to consolidate the concept of DDM
inversion for DMSSλ estimation.

5. Conclusion

References

We have reported the ﬁrst inversion of GNSS-
R full Delay-Doppler Maps for the retrieval of the
sea-surface directional mean square slope, DMSSL.
In addition, we have presented a repetition of the
Cox and Munk experiment for DMSSOpt retrieval
through inversion of Tilt Azimuth Map of sun glitter
optical photographs.

Our results show that both optical and L-band
total MSS are 20% higher than predicted using
Elfouhaily’s model for the observed wind speed (9
to 13 m/s). The SPA estimated by GNSS-R matches
the swell direction with good accuracy for at least 2
out of 3 PRNs. A new geophysical product has been
discussed: the slope PDF isotropy, which can be re-
lated to wind/wave misalignement as well the degree
of sea development.

The analysis highlighted the important impact of
sea-state unmodeled parameters (such as swell) in

Since speculometry is sensitive to slope processes
over a wide range of scales,
the link between
DMSSλ and wind is not straightforward: total MSS

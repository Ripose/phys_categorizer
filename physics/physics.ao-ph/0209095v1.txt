Model for optical forward scattering by nonspherical
raindrops

We describe a numerical model for the interaction of light with large raindrops using realistic
nonspherical drop shapes. We apply geometrical optics and a Monte Carlo technique to perform
ray traces through the drops. We solve the problem of diﬀraction independently by approximating
the drops with areaequivalent ellipsoids. Scattering patterns are obtained for diﬀerent polarizations
of the incident light. They exhibit varying degrees of asymmetry and depolarization that can be
linked to the distortion and thus the size of the drops. The model is extended to give a simpliﬁed
long-path integration. c(cid:13) 2008 Optical Society of America

Introduction

2. The Ray Trace Method

Large raindrops are deformed from spheres because of
aerodynamic pressure as they fall at terminal veloc-
Beard and Chuang’s4 (and Chuang and
ity.1–3
Beard’s5) model results for the ﬂattening at the base
of the drops are used in this study. Drop shapes are
speciﬁed by

where a is the radius of the undistorted sphere, lo-
cated at the center of mass of the drop; θ is the polar
elevation with θ = 0◦ pointing vertically downward
(Fig. 1) and cn are shape co-eﬃcients given in Ta-
ble 1. Most previous research is restricted to spherical
drops6–8 or ellipsoid particles.9 Macke and Groklaus10
used the same distorted drop shapes as the present
study for backscattering applicable to lidar measure-
ments of rainfall intensities. In the current study we
are interested in using drop distortion in a forward-
scatter mode so as to measure drop size and, for long
paths, rainfall intensity. A complete description of the
model, including its application to a long path inte-
gration, can be found in Ross.11

We used a Monte Carlo approach in which a large
number of photons are traced through the drop using
geometrical optics. Diﬀraction is accounted for ana-
lytically. For our simulation we chose a wavelength of
λ = 650 nm, and thus the size parameter x = 2πa/λ
is in the range 5 · 103 . x . 4 · 104 for the drop sizes
in Table 1. Glantschnig and Chen6 found that geo-
metrical optics produced good results in comparison
with the rigorous Mie theory for x ≥ 20 and scatter-
ing angles ≤ 60◦. Macke et al.12 found this condition
In a diﬀerent study,13 computations
to be x ≥ 60.
were carried out over a wide range of size parameters.
The results showed that the deviation from Mie the-
ory is less than 1% for size parameters x ≈ 104 and
m = 1.33, conﬁrming the validity of our geometrical
optics approach.

A. Forward Scattering
Table 2, adapted from van de Hulst,14 gives the forward-
and backward-scattered intensities for spherical scat-
terers and polarizations perpendicular and parallel to
the scattering plane (polarization 1 and 2, respec-
tively). Over 91% of light of polarization 1 and more
than 97% of polarization 2 is forward scattered. As
can be seen from Table 2, upward of 99.5% of the total
forward-scattered light for both polarizations emerges
from the ﬁrst interface after simple reﬂection (p = 0)
and from the second interface after twofold refraction
(p = 1). The fraction of forward-scattered intensity in
the p = 0 and p = 1 rays increases for more distorted
drops (see Section 4), and so it is suﬃcient to con-
sider only the contributions of these rays to forward
scattering.

B. The Procedure

Fig. 2 shows the ﬂow diagram for the ray trace model.
The model is run with N = 108 photons. Runs for dif-
ferent polarizations of the incident light use the same
set of random photons to exclude statistical variations
as a possible cause for diﬀerences in the scattering pat-
terns. The photons propagate parallel to the x axis
from negative x toward the drop, and a point P on
the drop’s surface can be represented in Cartesian co-
ordinates by

1◦ resolution in Θ and Φ. Each photon generated is
assigned a weight of one. The intensity fractions for
p = 0 and p = 1 are stored in an intensity matrix I
with Θ and Φ as row and column indices, respectively.

3. Diﬀraction

Analytic solutions for diﬀraction from distorted drop
shapes do not exist. Here, drop shapes are approxi-
mated by area-equivalent ellipsoids, for which the diﬀrac-
tion pattern is known. This approximation is veri-
ﬁed when the exact diﬀraction problem is numerically
solved for one of the larger drops. Results showed

where φ is the azimuth angle, increasing clockwise
from the y-axis. The surface normal at P is

Using Snell’s law and the Fresnel equations, we can
now trace the photons through the drop. The detec-
tor coordinates (Θ,Φ) are deﬁned similarly to (θ,φ),
and arriving photons are resolved into angular bins of

A. Diﬀraction from Spheres

The framework for the elliptical approximation is based
on diﬀraction from a spherical aperture:16, 17

where E is the electric ﬁeld amplitude, giving intensity
I ∝ |E |2. EA denotes the source strength per unit area
of the aperture; and r the distance between its center
and the detector (Fig. 3). The solution is

number 2π/λ, and J1 is the Bessel function of the
ﬁrst kind and order one. The solution does not de-
pend on the angle Σ due to the circular symmetry.

By integrating relation 5, we write the fraction of the
total intensity contained within a cone of angle Ψ as

L(Ψ) = 1 − J 2

0 (ak sin(Ψ)) − J 2

1 (ak sin(Ψ)) ,

(6)

where J0 is the Bessel function of order zero.18

If the energy ﬂux through a ring element of area
2πr2 sin Ψ dΨ (Fig. 4) is L′(Ψ) dΨ, then the fractional
ﬂux through a detector element of angular dimensions
(dΘ,dΦ) and area r2 sin Θ dΘ dΦ is

L′(Ψ)

which can be expressed in terms of detector coordi-
nates because cos Ψ = sin Θ sin Φ. After this substitu-
tion and further simpliﬁcations, the ﬁnal result is

. The in-

the size of the bin. By analogy with the intensity
matrix introduced in Subsection 2.B, this yields the
181 × 181 intensity matrix ˜I for diﬀraction, which we
ﬁnd numerically.

B. Approximating the Drop Shapes with Ellipsoids

The Fraunhofer diﬀraction integral for the distorted
drops has no analytic solution as ̺ is a function of θ.
Hence we approximate the drops with areaequivalent
ellipsoids. The cross-sectional area of the drops can

shapes is the largest for the bigger drops and vanishes
as the size (and the ﬂattening at the base) of the drop
decreases. Fig. 5 shows some examples.

Extending the circular aperture in one direction
by a constant factor µ will cause the diﬀraction pat-
tern to contract in that direction by the same factor.
Because of the µ times larger area of the aperture, the
intensity is µ2 times the original intensity at each point
mapped from the original pattern.17, 19 Hence we can
calculate the contribution to each bin from diﬀraction
using elliptic obstacles from the results of a circular
aperture.

C. Verifying the Elliptic Approximation

In this subsection the diﬀraction integral is evaluated
numerically for one exact drop shape. The results are
used to validate the elliptic approximation. The con-
stant radius ̺ in Eq. (4) is replaced by the cosine dis-
tortion ﬁt from Eq. (1), and the variable of integration
is changed from ̺ to a, the radius of the undistorted
sphere. Eq. (4) becomes

which can be evaluated numerically for a given pair of
detector coordinates (q,Σ). To return to the original
detector coordinates (Θ, Φ) it can be shown that

q
r

cos(θ − Σ) = cos θ cos Θ − sin θ cos Φ .

(16)

Making the replacements in Eq. (10) and (11) leads to
the same integral as in Eq. (14) except that χ now rep-
resents k times the right-hand side of Eq. (16) instead
of the left-hand side.

Because I ∝ |E |2, only the real part of Eq. (15)
needs to be solved. Fig. 6 shows the results obtained
for a distorted drop with radius a = 3 mm. The
locations of the ﬁrst three minima exhibit a clear el-
liptic symmetry. The dotted lines emerging radially
from the center represent the lines along which the in-
tegrations were carried out. The dotted circles with
numbers next to them give the lines of constant Ψ as
percentages of a degree. The resolution for the integra-
tion was 10,000 points/deg, which gives approximately
500 points from the center of Fig. 6 to the outermost
circle.

A continuous plot of the ﬁeld amplitudes E (q, 0◦)
and E (q, 90◦) is shown in Fig. 7. The eccentricity
of the pattern is obvious. The ﬁrst minimum in the
Σ = 90◦ direction is considerably closer to the center,
indicating the contraction in the horizontal. A simi-
lar comparison between E (q, 0◦) and E (q, 180◦) (not
shown) yields two identical curves within the margin

of error, conﬁrming the symmetry of the pattern about
the horizontal. An interesting feature is the somewhat
elongated sixth maximum in the Σ = 0◦ direction.
This feature returns in a similar shape with every 11th
maximum.

A more quantitative account of the possible ﬂat-
tening in the pattern for the 3-mm drop can be ob-
tained from ℵ(q) = (E (q, 270◦) − E (q, 90◦))/E (q, 90◦),
which gives a measure for the relative deviation from
horizontal symmetry. Values do not exceed 0.4% and
are only notably over 0.1% within 0.1◦ of the central
forward direction. We believe that this fully justiﬁes

the elliptic approximation, especially given the applied
angular resolution of 1◦ and also considering that the
distortion decreases for smaller drops. The same com-
putations can be carried out along the Σ = 0 and
Σ = 180◦ directions. Values in the absolute deviation
do not exceed 4 · 10−6, which is the region of error
applied during the numerical integration and can thus
be neglected.

The results from the computer model are presented
separately for the ray trace (no diﬀraction) and for
scattering including diﬀraction. The scattering pat-
terns are displayed by a sinusoidal projection method
(which means that the meridians appear as sine func-
tions), hence the scale is preserved only on the central
meridian and along the lines of latitude. This projec-
tion method also renders the region around the central
forward direction without distortions.

A. Scattering from Single Drops – excluding Diﬀraction

The phase is omitted because the path lengths of the
photons arriving at a particular bin can diﬀer by sev-
eral tens of wavelengths. These eﬀects cancel out for
a large number of photons and do not contribute any
valuable information to the pattern.

Fig. 8 shows the scattering patterns for a 3-mm
drop and 108 photons. In Fig. 8(a) the incoming light
was unpolarized. The pattern exhibits a symmetry
about the central meridian that is to be expected from
the rotational symmetry of the drops about their ver-
tical axis. This can also be observed in the corre-
sponding polar plot of Fig. 9(a) that shows the inten-
sity distribution along the Θ = 82◦ line that contains
the absolute maximum. The concentric semicircles are
lines of constant intensity, and the numbers give the
corresponding intensities as powers of ten. Fig. 9(b)
shows the distribution along the Φ = 90◦ meridian. A
distinguishing feature is the lack of symmetry about
the equator. The absolute maximum has shifted from
the equator (Θ = 90◦) to Θ = 82◦. It is accompanied
by another local maximum at Θ = 130◦. For smaller
drop sizes, the absolute maximum shifts closer to the
(90◦,90◦) direction again.

Another prominent feature in Fig. 8(a) is the
sharp gradient, creating a steep intensocline that sep-
arates the central area of relatively high intensity from
the outer, low-intensity regions.
It is identiﬁed by
the narrowly spaced contour lines. The model was
used to record the intensities from the rays p = 0 and
p = 1 separately. The light that arrives outside the
intensocline has mostly undergone a single reﬂection
at the ﬁrst interface, whereas the high-intensity area
is mainly lit by the twice-refracted rays.

Fig. 8: Contour plots of the intensity distribution obtained from a 3 mm drop, for: (a) unpolarised light, (b) y- and (c) z-polarised
light. A plot of the diﬀerence in the obtained intensities for y-polarised and z-polarised light (non-logarithmic) is shown in (d).
Note that the gray scale below (c) applies for (a) to (c) while (d) being the only non-logarithmic plot has a scale of its own.

Fig. 8(b) shows the pattern for the same drop but
with incident light polarized parallel to the y axis.
There are two distinct minima near the equator at
extreme angles for Φ. This can also be seen on the
corresponding polar plot Fig. 9(c). The sum of contri-
butions from all angular bins is slightly (≈ 1%) larger
than for unpolarized light. The opposite is true if
the incident light is polarized parallel to the z axis as
shown in Fig. 8(c): The distinct minima are on the
Φ = 90◦ meridian, symmetrically at Θ = 90◦ ± 74◦.
Light that is reﬂected into the angular bins containing
the observed minima in Figs. 9(c) and 9(d) originates
from points on the drop’s surface where the angle of

incidence is at the Brewster angle of αp = 53.06◦ and
where the plane of polarization of the incident light is
parallel to the scattering plane.

Fig. 8(d) shows the diﬀerence between the re-
sults obtained for y-polarized and z-polarized incident
light. This plot shows the absolute deviation, and the
minima that can be seen in Figs. 8(b) and 8(c) do
not appear. There is, however, a signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ence in the high-intensity area, inside the intensocline
and especially near the absolute maximum. Note that
the scale of this last plot is nonlogarithmic to allow
for both positive and negative diﬀerences. A high-
intensity ridge that extends from Θ = 78◦ to Θ = 86◦

Fig. 9: Polar plots for a 3 mm drop showing the intensity distribution along: (a) Θ = 82◦ and (b) Φ = 90◦, both for unpolarised
light; (c) Θ = 82◦ for y-polarised light and (d) Φ = 90◦ for z-polarised light. The graphs in (e) and (f) show the diﬀerence
between the results for y- and z-polarised light along Θ = 81◦ and Φ = 90◦ respectively. Negative values are plotted into the
lower half of the circles.

on the central meridian contains values that exceed
the maximum value covered by the scale (compare
with Fig. 9(f)). The actual maximum in Fig. 8(d)
is 9200 and is located at Θ = 81◦. The maximum
diﬀerence of 9200 photons at the central maximum is
equivalent to 12.5% in relative terms, which explains
why this feature does not appear on the individual
contour plots in Figs. 8(b) and 8(c). If the pattern in
Fig. 8(d) is divided by the (nonlogarithmic) intensity
from Fig. 8(a) (result not shown), the extrema outside
the intensocline visible in Figs. 8(b) and 8(c) can be

observed. The intensity diﬀerence at these extrema is
nearly twice the intensity value that is obtained there
for unpolarized incident light. If the incident light is
unpolarized, the reﬂectance R at αp is half of the value
of R⊥. Because Rk is equal to zero, the diﬀerence be-
tween the y- and z-polarized intensity is equal to R⊥.
Dividing R⊥ by R for unpolarized light thus always
yields 2. The ﬁnite size of the angular bins allows in-
clusion of rays for which the angle of incidence diﬀers
slightly from αp. This should always keep the abso-
lute value of the extremes slightly below 2. A drop

of radius a = 0.5 mm, for example, has its extreme
values at 1.98 and -1.95, and the corresponding val-
ues for spherical drops are ±1.95. The reason why
this is not observed for larger drops along the cen-
tral meridian might be a combination of the varying
curvature along the vertical axis and statistical ﬂuctu-
ations because the bins at such extreme angles contain
only approximately 35 photons out of the total of 100
million.

Fig. 9(e) gives a clearer image of what happens
along the Θ = 81◦ latitude. The scale is again log-
arithmic to accommodate the large spread of values.
The pattern is dominated by the central maximum
and two broad maxima on each side. For smaller drop
sizes the central maximum becomes less dominant and
is almost nonexistent for a 1-mm drop. The two pe-
ripheral maxima, however, remain almost constant in
size and location.

Fig. 9(f) shows the intensity distribution along

spaced maxima and minima. There is a general de-
crease in the number of signiﬁcant extrema to be ob-
served with decreasing drop size, accompanied by a
general increase in overall symmetry.

Over 99.5% of the forward-scattered light from
spherical scatterers emerges from either single reﬂec-
tion (ray p = 0) or twofold refraction (p = 1). The
assumption was made that this would be similar for
distorted drops, thus justifying rays with p > 1 being
neglected.

Fig. 10(a) shows the percentages of forward-scat-
tered intensity in p = 0 and p = 1 for unpolarized inci-
dent light and drop sizes ranging from a = 0.5 mm to
a = 4.5 mm. The fraction of forward-scattered inten-
sity increases with drop size, reaching a maximum for
drops with a = 3.5 mm. The rapid decline for larger

drops can be explained from Fig. 10(b), which shows
the percentage of photons that are internally reﬂected
and thus discarded by the model. It can be seen that
internal reﬂection can be neglected for most drop sizes
and becomes noticeable only for large drops.

To be able to give a quantitative comparison with
some tabulated values, the model was used to ﬁnd the
scattering pattern that would be produced by unpolar-
ized light that is incident on a sphere of radius 0.1 mm.
The result is given in Table 3. It compares the fraction
of energy that is scattered forward in rays p = 0 and
p = 1 from the computer model and Table 2. These
diﬀer by less than 0.2%, justifying the model and its
assumptions.

B. Scattering from Single Drops – including Diﬀraction

The diﬀraction pattern is dominated by a narrow diﬀrac-
tion peak in the central forward direction. The width
of this diﬀraction peak depends on the size of the scat-
terer. The eﬀects of diﬀraction are therefore demon-
strated for two extreme drop sizes: a 0.1-mm spherical
drop and a 3-mm drop. Figures 11(a) and 11(b) show
the combination of diﬀraction and ray trace together
with the results from the ray trace alone. The cen-
tral maximum for the 3-mm drop is much sharper and
slightly higher than for the smaller drop. The solid
and dashed curves only diﬀer noticeably near the cen-
tral diﬀraction peak, whereas the intensity at other
angles is almost unchanged. This is signiﬁcant for

the design of an instrument to measure drop sizes. If
the detectors are placed well oﬀ the central diﬀraction
peak, the results can be simulated with contributions
from the ray trace only. This is illustrated in a more
quantitative form in Fig. 12. It shows the percentile
change of the intensity distribution from the ray trace
after diﬀraction is added. For the large 3-mm drop,
the pattern is aﬀected only by diﬀraction for angles
of Ψ . 1◦ if we accept a 1% margin of error. For
the smaller drop the same criterion would yield the
condition Ψ . 10◦.

5. Practical Application

If a large number of individual ﬁeld measurements is
averaged, the underlying pattern linking the rainfall
rate with drop diameter shows an exponential charac-
ter as ﬁrst proposed by Marshall and Palmer.20 They
suggested the following empirical relationship, the so-
called MarshallPalmer distribution:

N (D) = N0 exp (−ΛD),

N0 = 0.08 cm−4;

(17)

where N (D)dD is the number of drops per unit vol-
ume having diameters between D and D + dD. The
intercept parameter N0 gives the intercept with the
ordinate for D = 0. The distribution depends entirely
on the parameter Λ that is determined by the rainfall
rate R: Λ = 41R−0.21 where R is in millimeters per
hour and Λ is in inverse centimeters.

We can now establish a function P (D) to repre-
sent the cumulative probability of ﬁnding a drop with
a diameter between 0 and D in a large enough sample:

Fig. 13 shows the result for diﬀerent rainfall intensi-
ties. For R = 10 mm/h, more than 50% of the in-
cident light falls on drops with D > 1 mm, which is
where drops start showing ﬁrst signs of distortion. For
heavier rain, more larger drops are present; and, as in
the example of a R = 100 mm/h event, approximately
80% of the incident light falls on distorted drops. This
suggests that drops with D < 0.2 mm do not con-
tribute signiﬁcantly to the scattered intensity and can
be neglected, which would produce only a 5% error
even for light rain with predominantly small drops.

A. Multiple Scattering

The optical depth of a path of length z can be deﬁned
as:

P (D) = 1 − exp (−ΛD)

(18)

τz = Ne C z ,

(21)

If the drops are approximated as spheres of area π/4 D2
(which is possible because the number of drops de-
creases rapidly as the distortion increases - see Eq. (18))
and by integrating Eq. (17) (while neglecting the con-
stants N0 and π/4 that both cancel out in the normal-

where Ne is the number of drops per unit volume in
the sample and C is the extinction cross section. As
was discussed in Section 3, the extinction cross section
approaches a limiting value of 2A (where A is the area
of the scatterer) for particles with x ≫ 1, and thus

Hulst14 argues that single scattering prevails if τz <
0.1; corrections for double scattering are necessary for
0.1 < τz < 0.3, and multiple scattering is observed
for even larger values of τz. Other sources21 maintain
that multiple scattering can be neglected for τz values
of up to one.

Making the substitution, we ﬁnd the area-distribution

with the approximation exp (−0.8Λ) ≈ 0 yielding neg-
ligible errors even for high rainfall intensities.

It has been shown experimentally (e.g., Ref.22)
that, for a constant mean rainfall rate R, the number
of drops is Poisson distributed around the mean. NV
is therefore used as a mean value to produce a Pois-
son deviate NP . Once the volume is ﬁlled with NP
drops, each drop is randomly assigned a size from an
exponentially weighted distribution:

D = −

ln x with x ∈ ]0, 1]

(28)

1
Λ

where x is a randomly generated number. The drops
are then released and fall at their terminal velocities
(with the values from Gunn and Kinzer23) through
V . Every t seconds a snapshot is taken, recording the
number of drops present in the beam and their sizes.

C. Results

The scattering patterns are obtained when the pat-
terns from individual drops are combined according
to their abundance in the beam. The patterns from
the individual drops are normalized with the cross-
sectional area to obtain a constant intensity per unit
area. The result is a time series that gives the varia-
tions of the received intensity for each angular bin.

As expected, the results show that the higher
the rainfall rate, the higher the mean scattered in-
tensity over the sampling period. This is shown in
Fig. 15 for two diﬀerent angular bins. The mean de-
tected intensity is thus a conclusive indication of the
rainfall intensity R. The degree of asymmetry about
the equator can also be used to infer the rainfall rate.
Fig. 16 shows the diﬀerence between angular bins at
(Θ, Φ) = (90◦–∆Θ, 90◦) and (Θ, Φ) = (90◦+∆Θ, 90◦).

Fig. 16: Relative deviations from vertical symmetry in the scat-
tering data for diﬀerent rainfall intensities and diﬀerent angular
bins. The deviation is given as a percentage of the total received
intensity at (Θ, Φ) = (90◦+∆Θ, 90◦).

As can be seen, the amount of light received in the bin
below the equator is considerably higher than for the
corresponding element symmetrically above the equa-
tor. The diﬀerence increases as expected with rainfall
intensity and varies depending on the distance to the
equator.

Although the light intensity is a stable indicator
of the rainfall rate, the eﬀects of wind on the orien-
tation of the vertical axis of the drop can be severe
on the above symmetry considerations. Other factors
that are likely to occur in real situations and that are
neglected in this model are coalescence, drop breakup,
and oscillations, as well as multiple-scattering events.
Possible realizations of ﬁeld experiments are given in
Ref.11

6. Summary

The distorted shape of raindrops at terminal velocity
is often ignored and approximated with either spheres
or ellipsoids. In contrast, the numerical model devel-
oped in this study determines the scattering pattern
for the true drop shapes. This was achieved through
a combination of geometrical optics and a statistical
Monte Carlo technique. The ray trace yielded scatter-
ing patterns for diﬀerent drop sizes and polarizations
of the incident light. The shape of the drops could
be inferred from the varying degrees of depolarization
of the scattered light and the asymmetries observed
in the overall scattering behavior. No experimental
data are available for light scattering from distorted
drops. However, the results obtained for small (spher-
ical) drops match tabulated values conﬁrming the va-
lidity of the model.

successfully approximating the drops as ellipsoids. The
error incurred has been found to be negligible even for
the largest drops examined. Adjustments for the re-
sults from the ray trace were necessary only near the
central diﬀraction peak whereas diﬀraction can be ne-
glected for the remaining pattern.

The asymmetries in the scattering behavior can
be used for rainfall measurements with a laser and
several detectors as the drop size distribution depends
on the rainfall intensity and thus inﬂuences the over-
all symmetry. Further details including the experi-
mental realization and application to high-resolution
measurements of rainfall structures can be found in

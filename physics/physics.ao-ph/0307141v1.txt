CONSTRAINED-HAMILTONIAN SHALLOW-WATER
DYNAMICS ON THE SPHERE ∗

F. J. BERON-VERA
RSMAS, University of Miami, Florida, USA

Abstract. Salmon’s nearly geostrophic model for rotating shallow-water ﬂow is derived in
full spherical geometry. The model, which results upon constraining the velocity ﬁeld to
the height ﬁeld in Hamilton’s principle for rotating shallow-water dynamics, constitutes
an important prototype of Hamiltonian balanced models. Instead of Salmon’s original
approach, which consists in taking variations of particle paths at ﬁxed Lagrangian labels
and time, Holm’s approach is considered here, namely variations are taken on Lagrangian
particle labels at ﬁxed Eulerian positions and time. Unlike the classical quasigeostrophic
model, Salmon’s is found to be sensitive to the diﬀerences between geographic and
geodesic coordinates. One consequence of this result is that the β plane approximation,
which is included in Salmon’s original derivation, is not consistent for this class of model.

1. Introduction

The rotating shallow-water (SW) equations constitute a paradigm for geo-
physical ﬂuid motions ranging from fast timescale dynamics, associated
with inertia-gravity waves, to slow advective-timescale dynamics, associated
with nonlinear vortical motions and Rossby waves (cf. Gill, 1982; Pedlosky,
1987). This set of equations constitute the “primitive” equations on which
diﬀerent approximations are usually performed. In this paper I deal with
those approximations which involve the introduction of balance relations or
constraints that lead to ﬁltering out the fast degrees of freedom. Terms com-
monly used to denote the resulting models are “balanced,” “constrained,”
or “intermediate;” the latter, in particular, reﬂects the fact of being at
a level which is in between the primitive equations and the equations for
geostrophic motion. For an extensive review on the wide variety of balanced
models that exists in the literature the reader is referred to Allen et al.
(1990a).

F. J. BERON-VERA

Of particular interest are those balanced models derived by performing
approximations directly in Hamilton’s principle (HP) for SW dynamics as
proposed by Salmon(1983, hereafter referred to as S83). This procedure al-
lows the fundamental symmetry-based conservation laws of the underlying
primitive system to be preserved. The approach consists in substituting
leading order balance relations and asymptotic expansions into HP before
taking variations. In particular, S83’s model is derived by constraining the
velocity ﬁeld to the height ﬁeld in the form of a geostrophic balance relation,
i.e. between the pressure gradient and the Coriolis force. This so-called
L1 model, however, was shown to produce less accurate solutions to the
SW equations than those produced by other non-Hamiltonian intermediate
models (Allen et al., 1990a; Allen et al., 1990b; Barth et al., 1990). This
is indicative of the known fact that possession of Hamiltonian structure
is no guarantee of model’s accuracy. Nevertheless, other balance relation
choices—potentially more accurate than that considered by S83—are pos-
sible (Allen and Holm, 1996; Allen et al., 2002). This fact makes the L1
model an important prototype of constrained Hamiltonian models, and
thus motivates the present study.

The L1 nearly geostrophic model, as well as its relatives the extended-
geostrophic Hamiltonian models of Allen and Holm (1996) and Allen et al.
(2002), have been derived in the Cartesian coordinates of the β plane
approximation. Such approximation relies upon expansion of the equa-
tions of motion with respect to geographic (e.g. spherical longitude and
latitude) coordinates about some ﬁxed point on the surface of the planet,
in inverse powers of the (mean) radius of the planet. The expansion is
then truncated at ﬁrst order but retaining only the ﬁrst order variation
of the Coriolis parameter (the so called β term) and neglecting all met-
ric terms, which are of the same order as the β term! Consequently, the
β plane approximation is only valid locally and in geodesic coordinates
(Phillips, 1973; Verkley, 1990). These coordinate systems are such that all
the derivatives of the metric tensor vanishes identically at the origin and
thus locally look like Cartesian coordinates. Geographic coordinates are
not geodesic in general, except at the equator where coordinate curves
are geodesic curves, e.g. great circles in spherical geometry. Consequently,
only at the equator the β plane approximation is valid when written in
geographic coordinates, but this region is forbidden for the L1 model.

Remarkable is the fact that the quasigeostrophic (QG) model—perhaps
the most exploited model of (slow advective-timescale) intermediate dyna-
mics—has the property of being insensitive to diﬀerences between geo-
graphic and geodesic coordinates, namely the β plane approximation gives
the right QG equations (Pedlosky, 1987; Ripa, 1997a, hereafter referred
to as R97). Even though the QG system does not ﬁt within the frame of

models of the L1 class, i.e. it does not follow from an approximation made in
HP for SW motion, it can be derived from HP but for stationary variations
of a particularly chosen action (Virasoro, 1981; Holm and Zeitlin, 1998).

The goal of this paper is to derive an L1 model using non-Cartesian
geometry in order to make an assessment of the sensitivity of this model to
the diﬀerence between geographic and geodesic coordinates. I am not aware
of a similar development within the Hamiltonian framework except for the
works of Shutts (1989) and Verkley (2001). Shutts (1989) derived a modiﬁed
version of the Hoskins’ (1975) semigeostrophic equations, which are another
type of intermediate equations that can be derived from the L1 model
through a transformation into “geostrophic coordinates” (Salmon, 1985).
Verkley (2001), in turn, presented a derivation of an isentropic L1-type
model for application to atmospheric ﬂows; the model derived here is based
on SW dynamics. Unlike both Shutts’ (1989) and Verkley’s (2001) deriva-
tions, in this paper I use tools from non-Cartesian tensor algebra, which
leads to an invariant formulation for the dynamical equations of the L1
model.

§

The reminder of the paper is organized as follows. In

mathematical model for the Earth’s surface that deﬁnes the space in which
the analysis is carried out. Section 3 includes a derivation of the general
equations for a free particle on the smooth surface of the Earth in invariant
3.1. The
form. This is done from HP for a general spheroidal Earth in
usual spherical approximation is then applied to the resulting motion equa-
tions, which, in particular, are written in geographic coordinates (
3.2).
§
Section 3.3 presents a discussion of the consistency of the so-called planar
approximations, which include the classical f and β. Section 4 is devoted
to extending into non-Cartesian geometry Holm’s (1996, hereafter referred
to as H96) general HP for variations of Lagrangian particle labels at ﬁxed
Eulerian positions and time. The SW and L1 model equations are derived
4.4 and 4.5, respectively, using the spherical Earth’s model. The equa-
in
tions are written in a coordinate-invariant fashion on the sphere and then
particularized to the common geographic coordinate system. Concluding
remarks are given in
5. Appendix A presents various relationships involved
in the derivation of the equations. Appendix B is reserved for the discussion
and comparison of alternative HPs.

2.2. GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS ON S

Two main assumptions make the two-dimensional manifold S an idealized
model of the surface of the (solid) Earth. First, S is assumed to be em-
bedded in a three-dimensional Euclidean space which rotates steadily, with
spinning frequency Ω, with respect to a Newtonian inertial space. Second,
S is assumed to be a geopotential surface. Namely the projections onto TxS
of the centrifugal force (due to the spinning of the planet with respect
to an inertial reference frame) and the gravitational attraction (due
to the deviation of the shape of the planet from a perfect sphere and to
inhomogeinities in the mass distribution within the planet) are assumed to
balance one another exactly.

As a consequence of the second assumption it follows that

Φ := V + VC = const.

(2.9)

on S, where V is the gravitational potential, VC stands for the centrifu-
gal potential, and their sum, Φ, deﬁnes the geopotential. (The constant
in the above expression is arbitrary and can be freely set to zero.) The
centrifugal potential (per unit mass) can be expressed in invariant form as

where σ is the velocity of the x-system with respect to a suitable inertial
frame.

Finally, the acceleration of gravity is deﬁned as the minus gradient
of Φ, thereby determining the vertical direction at each point x on S. Its
magnitude is thus given by

g(x) =

2.3. SPHERICAL MODEL

It is convenient—and quite accurate—to consider S as a (two-dimensional)
sphere of radius R, say, but keeping the main eﬀect of the gravitational
force. Namely that it can sustain a steady rotation, relative to an inertial
frame, in any point on S. Thus let the coordinates on S be given by

x1 = (λ

λ0) R cos ϑ0,

x2 = (ϑ

ϑ0) R,

(2.12)

−

−

which are rescaled longitude, λ, and latitude, ϑ, that will be referred here
to as geographic coordinates. In this case one can introduce the usual
notations (x, y) for (x1, x2) and (ˆx, ˆy) for (e1, e2). The corresponding metric
matrix, velocity of the x-system, and centrifugal potential, respectively,
read:

Here,

f := 2Ω sin ϑ,

γ := sec ϑ0 cos ϑ,

τ := R

−1 tan ϑ;

(2.14)

the ﬁrst parameter is the Coriolis parameter whereas the other two are the
geometric coeﬃcients as deﬁned by Ripa (2000a,b). Consistently with this
spherical approximation, the acceleration of gravity is taken as a constant,
namely g

9.8 m2 s−1 .

More accurate models (not treated here) should account explicitly for
the ﬂattening of the planet at the poles. For instance, although still crude,
next in accuracy can be mentioned one that has the form of an axisymmetric
spheroid of revolution (Chandrasekhar, 1969; cf. also R97).

3. Particle Dynamics

In this section the manifold S is assumed to represent a smooth and fric-
tionless Earth’s surface on which a particle moves freely. The derivation
of the particle’s equations of motion is instructive inasmuch as it sets
the grounds for tackling the more complicated problem of the following
section. In particular, it shows clearly how the Coriolis force—which ﬁnds

L1Esfera.tex; 26/07/2013; 9:01; p.6

CONSTRAINED DYNAMICS ON THE SPHERE

7

its origin in the gravitational force—arises directly from a HP with an action
appropriate for an inertial observer, but written in coordinates ﬁxed to the
planet. The method is in essence the same as the one used by Pierre Simon
de Laplace (1749–1827) to introduce this force over quarter a century before
than Gaspard Gustave de Coriolis (1792–1843) was born (cf. R95; R96).
The analysis of the particle’s equations allows, in addition, one to simplify
the discussion on the consistency of the so-called planar approximations
(cf. R97).

3.1. GENERAL EQUATIONS

From an inertial observer viewpoint, the only force acting on the particle
is the gravitational one. The particle’s kinetic and potential energies (per
unit mass) as measured by this observer are given by

Equations (3.5) or (3.7) are invariant under general coordinate trans-
formations on S, which in this case is not restricted to the spherical Earth
model. In particular, these equations nicely show that the Coriolis term is
responsible for the particle’s trajectory to depart from a geodesic curve on
S, i.e. a pure Galilean inertial motion. The latter is only consistent with
motions with suﬃciently large initial kinetic energy as shown by R97, who
described all possible solutions on a sphere, namely the so-called inertial
oscillations.

3.3. “PLANAR” APPROXIMATIONS

In addition to the spherical approximation, other standard approximations
introduced in the equations are the “planar” approximations. These approx-
imations, which are meant to be valid locally at a point on the sphere in
geographic coordinates, are obtained by expanding the equations in inverse
powers of the radius of the sphere R. The most common approximations
being the f and β. The former is a consistent zeroth-order approximation.
The latter, however, is an inconsistent ﬁrst-order approximation, except at
the equator. A consistent nth-order approximation is understood as one
that produces O(R−n−1) errors in the integrals of motion associated with
the equations on the sphere. These integrals are the (kinetic) energy of the
particle as measured by a terrestrial observer,

E := 1

It is thus clear that a consistent ﬁrst-order approximation must include,
in general, non-Cartesian terms in order to correctly reproduce the conser-
vation laws of the system. (That is the reason for the quotation marks in
this section.) It is worthwhile remarking that this is no longer necessary
for motions around the equator. Geographic coordinates at the equator
are geodesic coordinates because all the derivatives of the metric vanish
there. For this reason locally at the equator the geometry in geographic
coordinates looks like Cartesian and, hence, the β plane is a consistent
approximation there. In general, for any point of a space with a symmet-
ric aﬃne connection coordinatized by xi, i = 1, 2,
, say, there exists
a coordinate system x′i, i = 1, 2,

equator) is questionable (cf. Phillips, 1973; Verkley, 1990).

4. Fluid Dynamics

In this section I derive from HP the equations of motion for (inviscid, un-
forced) SW and L1 dynamics on the spherical model for the Earth’s surface.
The derivation makes use of H96’s approach but extended to non-Cartesian
geometry. In this approach variations of Lagrangian particle labels are
performed at ﬁxed Eulerian positions and time. One advantage of H96’s
approach is that the equations result directly in Eulerian coordinates.

4.1. LAGRANGIAN AND EULERIAN COORDINATES

sure, where H(x) is the reference depth including the possibility of an
irregular topography. The choice h0 = const. is necessary in order for the
Lagrangian density to be independent of the Lagrangian labels. The as-
sumption g = const., in turn, is consistent with the spherical approximation
for the Earth’s surface. The last term on the r.h.s. of (4.14), which is not

Other decompositions, appart than (4.27), as well as other balance
relationships, diﬀerent than (4.28), are possible (Allen and Holm, 1996;

plicated topographies can of course be considered.) Notice the absence of
geometric coeﬃcients in (5.47). Those terms, which do appear in the corre-
sponding (diagnostic) momentum and volume conservation equations, have
(fortuitously) cancelled out in the process of constructing the (prognostic)
potential vorticity equation (5.47) [Pedlosky 1987; R97]. Consequently—
and remarkably—QG ﬂows develop as if the geometry were Cartesian,
“feeling” the latitudinal variation of the Coriolis parameter as the only
eﬀect of the Earth’s sphericity.

The L1 model shares a series of diﬀerences and similarities with the
above QG model. Although both models are derivable from HP, the QG
model’s action is not seen to derive from approximations performed in SW’s
action. As QG motions, those governed by the L1 model are not allowed at
the equator, i.e. where f vanishes. In addition to Rossby waves, the linear
waves of the L1 model include (a form of) Kelvin waves, which are not
supported by the QG model. Unlike QG motions, L1 motions are restricted
neither to O(ε) meridional excursions nor to O(ε) displacements of the
free surface from the position of equilibrium at rest, nor to the presence of
O(ε) topographic variations. In a reduced-gravity setting, the equations for
both SW and L1 models have the same structure as those presented here,
except that in that case g must be identiﬁed with the buoyancy jump at
the interface between the active and the quiescent (inﬁnitely deep) bottom
layer, and H(x) must be understood as the nonuniform thickness of the
active layer at rest, including the possibility of a nonspherical rigid surface.

Clearly, a consistent (not necessarily the optimal, though) geometric ap-
proximation for L1 dynamics, which is ﬁrst-order accurate in R, is given
by the non-Cartesian Ripa “plane” and not by the standard β plane (recall
that it has τ0 = 0). The latter is the one included in the original derivation
of the L1 model. An important contribution of the present work to the
above list of diﬀerences and similarities between the L1 and QG models
is thus the sensitivity of the former to the diﬀerences between geographic
and geodesic coordinates. This result conﬁrms Ripa’s (2000b) in the sense
that Earth’s curvature eﬀects increase in importance as the motions deviate
from strictly geostrophic (divergence-free) motions. The thorough evalua-
tion of these eﬀects, apart from checking that the equations have the right
conservation laws, is a subject for futher research. The latter should involve
direct numerical simulations in which predictions of the L1 model on the
β-plane and the sphere (or the Ripa “plane”) are compared.

Finally, Ripa (1983) showed that steady SW ﬂows on the sphere posses
a formal stability theorem. The latter involving an Arnold-like ﬁrst theorem
for the stability of QG ﬂows, and a condition for the ﬂow to be “subsonic” in
the sense that the (geostrophic) basic ﬂow must be everywhere slower than
the slowest gravity-wave of the system. Ren and Shepherd (1997) showed,
in turn, that steady L1 ﬂows on the β plane posses a Ripa-like formal
stability theorem, as well as a nonlinear (or Lyapunov) stability theorem in
which the “subsonic” condition of Ripa’s theorem is replaced by a condition
that the ﬂow be cyclonic along the lateral boundaries. The latter was shown
by Ren and Shepherd (1997) to have an interpretation involving coastal
Kelvin waves, which are not included in the QG model. Whether or not L1

ﬂows on the sphere (or the Ripa “plane”) enjoy similar stability properties
is an issue that needs more investigation.

The standard approach for ﬁelds x(x, t) consists in considering an action
functional of the form

The latter can be shown to be equivalent to (4.12) only in the particular

In the variational approach for ﬁelds x(x, t) the action is of the form

Upon variations of particle paths at ﬁxed Lagrangian labels and time, the
following Euler–Lagrange equations result from HP:

(B.5)

(plus appropriate boundary conditions). This is but the inﬁnite-dimensional
analogue of the particle’s HP. For instance, S83’s derivation of the SW and
L1 systems in the Cartesian coordinates of the β plane and van der Toorn’s
(1997) derivation of the SW equations on the sphere are based on this HP.
One disadvantage of this variational approach, however, is that the resulting
equations are in Lagrangian coordinates, which requires application of the
inverse map ϕ−1 (4.2) to transform back to Eulerian coordinates.

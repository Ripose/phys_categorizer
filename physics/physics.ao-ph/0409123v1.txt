On climate response to changes in the cosmic ray ﬂux and
radiative budget

Abstract. We examine the results linking cosmic ray ﬂux (CRF) variations to global
climate change. We then proceed to study various periods over which there are estimates
for the radiative forcing, temperature change and CRF variations relative to today. These
include the Phanerozoic as a whole, the Cretaceous, the Eocene, the Last Glacial Max-
imum, the 20th century, as well as the 11-yr solar cycle. This enables us to place quan-
titative limits on climate sensitivity to both changes in the CRF, ΦCR, and the radia-
tive budget, F , under equilibrium. Under the assumption that the CRF is indeed a cli-
mate driver, we ﬁnd that the sensitivity to CRF variations is consistently ﬁtted with µ ≡
−Φ0(dTglobal/dΦCR) ≈ 6.5 ± 2.5◦K (where Φ0 is the CR energy ﬂux today). Addition-
ally, the sensitivity to radiative forcing changes is λ ≡ dTglobal/dF |0 = 0.35±0.09◦KW−1 m2,
at the current temperature, while its temperature derivative is negligible with (dλ/dT )0 =
0.01±0.03 m2 W−1. If the observed CRF/climate link is ignored, the best sensitivity ob-
tained is λ = 0.54±0.12◦KW−1 m2 and (dλ/dT )0 = −0.02±0.05 m2 W−1. The CRF/climate
link therefore implies that the increased solar luminosity and reduced CRF over the pre-
vious century should have contributed a warming of 0.37±0.13◦K, while the rest should
be mainly attributed to anthropogenic causes. Without any eﬀect of cosmic rays, the in-
crease in solar luminosity would correspond to an increased temperature of 0.16±0.04◦K.

1. Introduction

Accumulating evidence suggests that solar activity is re-
sponsible for at least some climatic variability. These in-
clude correlations between solar activity and either direct
climatic variables or indirect climate proxies over time scales
ranging from days to millennia [Herschel , 1796; Eddy, 1976;
Labitzke and van Loon, 1992; Friis-Christensen and Lassen,
1991; Soon et al., 1996a, 2000; Beer et al., 2000; Hodell et al.,
2001; Neﬀ et al., 2001]. It is therefore diﬃcult at this point
to argue against the existence of any causal link between
solar activity and climate on Earth. However, the climatic
variability attributable to solar activity is larger than could
be expected from the typical 0.1% changes in the solar ir-
radiance observed over the decadal to centennial time scale
[Beer et al., 2000; Soon et al., 2000]. Thus, an ampliﬁer is
required unless the sensitivity to changes in the radiative
forcing is uncomfortably high.

The ﬁrst suggestion for an ampliﬁer of solar activity was
suggested by Ney [1959], who pointed out that if climate is
sensitive to the amount of tropospheric ionization, it would
also be sensitive to solar activity since the solar wind mod-
ulates the cosmic ray ﬂux (CRF), and with it, the amount
of tropospheric ionization [Ney, 1959].

Over the solar cycle, the solar wind strength varies con-
siderably, such that the amount of tropospheric ionization
Svensmark [1998, 2000],
changes by typically 5%-10%.
Marsh and Svensmark [2000a] as well as Palle Bago and
Butler [2000] have shown that the variations in the amount
of low altitude cloud cover (LACC) nicely correlate with
the CRF reaching Earth over two decades. Both signals, of
cloud cover and CRF variations lag by typically half a year
behind other solar activity indices. This suggests that it is
more likely that the cloud cover is directly related to the
CRF than directly to solar activity.

More recent data on the LACC seems to exhibit a weaker
correlation with the variable CRF (e.g., Farrar [2000]).
There are however a few peculiarities in the data which are
indicative of a calibration problem, which once removed,
seem to recover the high correlation between the CRF and
the LACC [Marsh and Svensmark , 2003]. For an objec-
tive review, the reader is encouraged to read Carslaw et al.
[2002].

The above correlations between CRF variability and cli-
mate (and in particular, cloud cover), indicate that CRF
modulations appear to be responsible for climate variabil-
ity, most probably through modulation of the amount of
LACC. Nevertheless, since all of the above CRF variability
ultimately originates from solar activity changes, it is not
possible to unequivocally rule out the possibility that the
CRF/climate correlations are coincidental, and that both
are independently modulated by solar activity with similar
lags.

An independent CRF/climate correlation on a much
longer time scale, in which variations in the CRF do not orig-
inate from solar variability, was found by Shaviv [2002a, b];
Shaviv and Veizer [2003]. It was shown using astronomical
data that a large ∼ O(1) CRF variability should arise from
our passages through the galactic spiral arms, with a period
of 132 ± 25 Ma.
It was also shown that the CRF history
can actually be reconstructed using the cosmic-ray expo-
sure age data of Iron meteorites, exhibiting a periodicity of
143 ± 10 Ma and a phase consistent with the astronomical
data. Moreover, it was found that the reconstructed CRF
nicely synchronizes to the occurrence of ice-age epochs on
Earth, which appeared on average every 145 ± 7 Ma over
the past billion years. Additionally, the mid-point of the
ice-age epochs is predicted to lag by 31 ± 8 Ma after the
mid-point of the spiral arm crossing, while it is observed to
lag by 33 ± 20 Ma. That is, the CRF and ice-age epoch
signals agree in both phase and period. The same analysis
also revealed that the long term star-formation activity of
the Milky Way correlates with long term glacial activity on
Earth. In particular, a dearth in star formation between 1
and 2 Ga before present, coincides with a long period during

X - 2

which glaciations appear to have been totally absent [Sha-
viv , 2002b, 2003].

We should also point out several experimental results sup-
porting, though not proving yet, a CRF/cloud cover link.
Harrison and Aplin [2001] found experimentally that CN
formation is correlated with natural Poisson variability in
cosmic ray showers. In other words, this link appears to be
more than hypothetical. In another set of experiments, it
was shown that cosmic rays play a decisive role in the forma-
tion of small clusters [Eichkorn et al., 2003]. If these small
clusters can be shown to grow quickly enough, as opposed
to being scavenged by large particles, the link between cos-
mic rays and the formation of cloud condensation nuclei and
ultimately cloud cover could be ﬁrmly established.

We will not dwell here on the actual mechanism responsi-
ble for CRF link with cloud behavior. We will simply assume
henceforth that this link exists, as supported by empirical
and experimental data, even though it is still an issue of
debate. This point has to be kept in mind since the conclu-
sions we shall reach, will only be valid if this assumption is
correct.

Using the above assumption, we study several time
scales to see whether estimates on global temperature sen-
sitivity can be placed, together with estimates on the
CRF/temperature relation. We will do so by comparing
the observed temperature changes with changes in the ra-
diative budget, an approach previously pursued in numerous
analyses (e.g., Hoﬀert and Covey [1992]; Covey et al. [1996];
Hansen et al. [1993]; Gregory et al. [2002]). This method
for obtaining the global temperature sensitivity using paleo-
data is orthogonal to the usage of global circulation models
(GCMs) upon which often quoted results are based [IPCC ,
2001]. Hence, the two methods suﬀer from altogether diﬀer-
ent errors. It is therefore clearly advantageous to follow this
path as an independent estimate. For example, Cess et al.
[1989] have shown that the large uncertainty in the sensi-
tivity obtained in GCMs stems from the uncertain feedback
of cloud cover. Since we use the actual global data, all the
feedbacks are implicitly considered. The main contribution
in this work is to speciﬁcally consider the contribution of the
CRF to the changed radiative budget. As a note of caution,
one should keep in mind that the most notable assumption
in this method is the quantiﬁcation of climate sensitivity
with one number. In other words, it assumes that on av-
erage Earth’s climate responds the same irrespective of the
geographic, temporal or frequency space distribution of the
radiation budget changes. It also assumes that diﬀerent ra-
diative forcings act linearly.

Once the radiative forcing and temperature changes are

obtained, the sensitivities can be estimated with

∆F , which is the globally averaged change in the radiation
ﬂux (per unit surface area), will also include here the con-
tribution ∆FCRF arising from a changed energy ﬂux ΦCR
of cosmic rays. Note also that over short time scales, ∆T or
∆F have to be properly modiﬁed to include the ﬁnite heat
capacity of the system, and the consequent ﬁnite adjustment
time it has. We should also consider the possibility that λ
is dependent on the temperature. For example, the positive
climate feedback arising from the formation of ice sheets
could increase the sensitivity of a glaciated Earth, while the
reduced atmospheric water vapor content, can reduce the
sensitivity.

2. Radiative forcing of low altitude cloud
cover

Without a detailed physical model for the eﬀects of cos-
mic rays on clouds or a detailed enough record of radiation
budget measurements correlated with the solar cycle, it is
hard to accurately determine the quantitative link between
CRF variations and changes in the global radiation budget.
In particular, it is hard to do so without limiting ourselves
to various approximations. Nevertheless, this link is impor-
tant since it will be used in most of our estimates for the
global temperature sensitivity.

The basic observation we use to estimate the radiative
forcing of clouds is the apparent correlation between CRF
variations and the amount of low altitude cloud cover. A
naive approximation is to assume that the whole climatic ef-
fect can be described by variations in the extent of the cloud
cover, namely, that we neglect eﬀects in the cloud proper-
ties, or possible climatic eﬀects associated with atmospheric
ionization but not with clouds. It also implies that the geo-
graphical distribution of the eﬀect is the same as low altitude
clouds on average. We will ﬁrst estimate this “zeroth” order
term and then try to estimate the possible contribution of
other corrections.

Amount of cloud cover: Over the solar cycle, the varying
CRF appears to cause a 1.2 to 2.0% (absolute) change in the
amount of LACC [Marsh and Svensmark , 2000b; Kirkby and
Laaksonen, 2000; Marsden and Lingenfelter , 2003; Carslaw
et al., 2002]. We will therefore adopt a change of 1.6 ± 0.4%
in the LACC.

The total radiative forcing of the LACC is estimated to
be −16.7W m−2 from the average 26.6% cloud cover [?]. If
one however compares the forcing of the total cloud cover
from diﬀerent hemispheres and diﬀerent experiments (Nim-
bus and ERBE, Ardanuy et al. [1991]), one ﬁnds variations
which are typically 2.5W m−2 on the ∼ 50W m−2 short-
wave (SW) “cooling” and 7W m−2 on the 27W m−2 long-
wave (LW) “warming”. Since LACC typically comprise half
of the total amount cloud cover, an error of ∼ 4W m−2 is to
be expected.

Thus, the changed radiative forcing ∆Ff associated with
the varying amount of cloud cover, should be −1.0 ±
0.35W m−2. This implicitly assumes that the incremental
cloud cover has the same average net radiative properties as
the whole 27% of the LACC.

Cloud Optical Depth: Changes in the cloud properties
could take place in addition to changes in the cloud amount.
According to Marsden and Lingenfelter [2003], there is a
small negative correlation between the average LACC opac-
ity ¯τ and the varying CRF. Over the solar cycle, ¯τ changes
by −4% relative to its global average of about 4 in regions
deﬁned to be covered by LACC.

Is such a change in ¯τ reasonable? According Marsden
and Lingenfelter [2003], there are two limiting cases for
the eﬀects on cloud properties. The ﬁrst is changing the
number density of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) given
a ﬁxed amount of Liquid Water Content (LWC), that is,
CCN limited. This is similar to the “Twomey eﬀect” where
enhanced aerosol density aﬀects the droplet size and cloud
albedo [Twomey, 1977; Rosenfeld , 2000]. The second case
is increasing the CCN density together with the LWC, and
obtaining similar sized drops (LWC limited). Although the
two cases are plausible, they do not change the cloud prop-
erties in the same way.

with β = 1 for LWC limited case and β = 1/3 for the CCN
limited case. Since the lower troposphere ionization rate
changes by about 7% between solar minimum and maxi-
mum, we should expect to get at most a similar increase in
the CCN. Thus we should expect δτ /τ ∼<7%. The fact that a
negative change in τ was observed [Marsden and Lingenfel-
ter , 2003], could arise because the increase in cloud lifetime
results with thinner clouds on average.

Next, one can approximate the relation between τ and

cloud albedo A, by the relation [Hobbs, 1993]:

where τ1/2 ≈ 6.7 for an asymmetry parameter of 0.85
[Hobbs, 1993]. Once we diﬀerentiate, we ﬁnd:

If we consider the transmission T ≈ 0.75 of the atmosphere
(to obtain a top-of-atmosphere albedo, from a cloud-top
albedo), that the LACC covers only a fraction flow of the
globe, and that the average top-of-atmosphere incidence of
radiation is ¯F = 344W m−2, we ﬁnd that the change in
albedo is responsible for a changed radiation budget of:

∆FA ≈

The positive sign implies that the small apparent reduction
in ¯τ contributes a small warming contribution.

If we had no knowledge of ¯τ , changes in it could have
resulted with a correction to ∆FA which are only as large
as −0.23W m−2 (for the LWC limited case, and δτ /τ ∼<7%).
We take this uncertainly in ¯τ as another source of error for
the radiative forcing ∆F .

Cloud Emissivity: There could still be more physical
terms contributing to ∆F . If the LWC in the clouds can vary
as well (that is, the clouds are not CCN limited but rather
water limited), then also the IR emissivity can change. It
will do so by changing the emissivity, relative to black body
(e.g., Stephens [1978]) which is given by:

ǫ(δz) = 1 − exp(−τIR).

(8)

where we have deﬁned τIR ≡ a0ρeﬀ δz. Here, ρeﬀ is the liq-
uid water content, a0 is the mass absorption coeﬃcient (for
water clouds, a0 ≈ 0.13m2g−1 [Stephens, 1978]) and δz is
the width of the cloud layer above a given point. By chang-
ing the emissivity, we change the outgoing long-wavelength
ﬂux by

where T ∼ 0.6 is
the atmo-
sphere to IR, above the cloud. For typically small val-
ues of ρeﬀ of 0.3g/m3, and δz = 100m (which would
give the largest eﬀect), we get corrections of ∆FIR =
1.1W m−2(∆ρeﬀ /ρeﬀ )∼<0.1W m−2. This positive ﬂux out-
wards tends to cool (i.e., increase the CRF/temperature ef-
fect), but it is a small eﬀect.

By changing the emissivity, we can also shift the appar-
ent location of the top of the clouds, and with it their tem-
perature.
In other words, we should expect outgoing LW
radiation to come from higher up the atmosphere where the
temperature is lower.

A higher ρeﬀ will shift the IR emission “surface” vertically

by typically:

Using the black body law, the change in the radiative emis-

once globally averaged. For the last inequality, we took a
typically low ρeﬀ of 0.3g/m3, a wet adiabat of dT /dz ∼
0.6◦K(100m)−1 and flow ≈ 0.28. Since ∆ρeﬀ/ρeﬀ ∼<0.1, this
eﬀect will be even smaller at best (and in opposite sign as
the previous eﬀect).

This result is also reasonable considering that the total
long wavelength heating eﬀect of LACC was estimated to
be ∼ 3.5W m−2 [?], while cloud albedo is responsible for
a globally averaged cooling of ∼ 20W m−2, implying that
changes in albedo will likely be more important for chang-
ing the radiative budget arising from LACC variations.

Ocean Bias: Additional unaccounted eﬀects are possible.
For example, as we have previously stated, we implicitly as-
sume that the incremental change in the LACC contributes
to the radiative budget as the LACC on average. This need
not be the case. Suppose the CRF-LACC eﬀect primarily
takes place over the oceans. This is reasonable because it
is the oceans where the density of CCN is lowest. Since the
oceans have a lower albedo than land, covering ocean sur-
face has a larger net decrease in the radiative budget than
covering land mass.

If the land albedo is typically higher by 15% and LACC is
typically half as frequent over land, then the albedo change
arising from uncovering clouds over only oceans is higher
than the albedo change obtained when uncovering the av-
erage LACC, by ∆A ∼ 3%. This corresponds to a ﬂux
change of ∆F∆A ≈ ∆AT 2∆flow ¯F ≈ +0.1W m−2. That is,
a likely ocean bias implies that we are slightly underestimat-
ing ∆FCRF .

Other eﬀects: If the eﬀect is geographically localized to
certain areas, then a larger discrepancy could arise if the
radiative properties of the LACC over those geographic re-
gions is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the properties of LACC
on average. A correlation map between LACC variations
and CRF change [Marsh and Svensmark , 2000b], reveals
that some regions (particularly over oceans) stand out with
a higher correlation than others. Nevertheless, they do not
appear to cluster around particular latitudes or other spe-
cial regions. Thus, the assumption of geographic uniformity
may be not that bad.

Another hard to estimate eﬀect could arise from the ex-
pected increase in cloud lifetime. For example, cumulus-
type clouds could penetrate into higher altitudes, thereby
reducing their IR emission.

SHAVIV: COSMIC RAYS AND CLIMATE SENSITIVITY

Thus, until we fully understand all the details in the
physical picture, we should take the estimated radiative
forcing and the error with a grain of salt. Taking the
above into considerations, our best estimate for the radia-
tive forcing of the cloud cover variations over the solar cy-
cle is ∆FCRF = ∆Ff + ∆FA + ∆F∆A = 1.0 ± 0.4W m−2,
globally averaged (we have neglected ∆FIR∼<0.1W m−2 and
−∆F∆T ∼<0.02W m−2). This should be compared with the
0.1% solar ﬂux variations, giving rise to an extra “direct”
forcing of ∆Fﬂux ≈ 0.35W m−2 [Frohlich and Lean, 1998].

A related number describes the relation between CRF
variations and changes in the low altitude ionization rate.
At energies which can reach the lower troposphere and low
geomagnetic latitudes (∼>10GeV ), a fair representative of
the ﬂux are the neutron measurements at Hunacayo Peru
and Halaekala, Hawaii (near the geomagnetic equator, with
a rigidity cutoﬀ of 12.9 GeV). There, the amplitude in the
CRF variations over the past few solar cycles was 7 ± 2%
[e.g., Svensmark , 1998] Thus, we ﬁnd that the radiative sen-
sitivity to CRF variations is about

3. Estimating Climate Sensitivity

We now proceed to estimate the climate sensitivity. We
do so by comparing the radiative forcing change between two
eras to the temperature change which ensued, using eq. 1.
In most estimates, we will rely on the results of §2 to ob-
tained the contribution of the changed CRF to the changed
radiative forcing. These include seven diﬀerent comparisons,
spanning from variations over the solar cycles, to variations
over the Phanerozoic as a whole. Subsequently, we will com-
bine the results to obtain our best estimate for the climate
sensitivity.

3.1. The ∆T /CO2 correlation over the Phanerozoic

Shaviv and Veizer [2003] have shown that more than 2/3’s
of the variance in the reconstructed tropical temperature
variability ∆Ttrop over the Phanerozoic can be explained
using the variable CRF, which could be reconstructed using
Iron meteorites. On the other hand, it was shown that the
reconstructed atmospheric CO2 variations do not appear to
have any clear correlation with the reconstructed tempera-
ture. The large correlation between reconstructed CRF and
temperature is seen in ﬁg. 1. It is this correlation which led
the authors to conclude that the Phanerozoic climate is pri-
marily driven by a celestial driver. The lack of any apparent
correlation with CO2 was used to place a limit on the global
climate sensitivity.

A subsequent analysis by Royer et al. [2004] has shown
that pH corrections could have been important at oﬀsetting
the δ18O record upon which the temperature reconstruction
In particular, The pH correction term of Royer
is based.
et al. [2004] has the form:

∆TpH = a{log RCO2 + log Λ(t) − log Ω(t)},

(13)

where RCO2 is the atmospheric partial pressure of relative
to today, Λ(t) is (Ca)(t)/(Ca)(0) - the mean concentration
of dissolved calcium in the water relative to today, while
Ω(t) is [Ca++][CO−−
]/Ksp at time t relative to today. The
value of a obtained in Royer et al. [2004] assumes no ice-
volume correction, yielding a = 3.4◦K. Once the ice-volume
eﬀect on δ18O is considered [Veizer et al., 2000; Shaviv and
Veizer ], one obtains: a ≈ 1.4◦K.

3

Since the pH correction depends on RCO2, so will the cor-
rected temperature. A simple correlation between the cor-
rected temperature and the reconstructed RCO2 will then be
meaningless. Instead, the method to proceed is to deﬁned a

CO2 “uncorrected” temperature as:

′

∆T

= ∆T − a log RCO2.

(14)

Any correlation that this signal will have with RCO2 will
then be real, since this “temperature” depends only on δ18O,
and the small Λ and Ω terms. This uncorrected temperature
can then be ﬁtted with

∆T

′
model = A + Bt + (C − a log10 2) log2 RCO2

(15)

+Dg(ΦCRF (t)).

A and B allow for systematic secular trends in the data. D
relates the cosmic ray energy ﬂux Φ(t) to ∆T [Shaviv and
Veizer , 2003]. The term (a log10 2)log2RCO2 was added such
that C will keep its original meaning in Shaviv and Veizer
[2003], which is the tropical temperature increase associated
with a doubled RCO2.

The lack of a correlation between δ18O and RCO2 [Shaviv
and Veizer , 2003] originates from the fact that (C −a log10 2)
happens to be coincidentally close to 0.
In other words,
the pH correction to δ18O and ∆T , happens to be similar
to the tropical temperature sensitivity to changes in RCO2
(Without the pH correction, the preferred value for C in the
absence of correlation is not a log10 2, but 0). Scientiﬁcally,
this is somewhat unfortunate, because without this coinci-
dence the δ18O signal would have had a clear correlation
with the RCO2 signal, and the RCO2 ﬁngerprint would have
been discernible in the Phanerozoic data.

If we repeat the analysis of Shaviv and Veizer (2003), and
consider also the eﬀects of alog Λ(t) − log Ω(t) introduced
by Royer et al. [2004], and corrected for RCO2 as described
above, we obtain: C = 0.69◦K (or an upper limit of 1.12,
1.42 and 1.73◦K at 68%, 90% and 99% conﬁdence levels,
and a lower limit of 0.39, 0.10, -0.21◦K, respectively). This
gives λ = 0.28 ± 0.15◦K W−1 m2.

Figure 1. The high correlation between the reconstructed
temperature and CRF over the Phanerozoic can be used
to estimate global sensitivity. Here, ∆T ′
is the recon-
structed temperature ∆T of Veizer et al. [2000] over the
past 550 Ma, with a small
linear temperature increase
of 1.7◦K(t/550M a) subtracted (see Shaviv and Veizer
[2003]). The CRF is one of 3 reconstructions used in Shaviv
and Veizer [2003]. The two others diﬀer in the total am-
plitude of variations. The two independent signals have a
high Pearson correlation of r = −0.77. Although a statisti-
cally signiﬁcants limits on p cannot be placed, lower p’s are
favored (with p ∼ 0.3 producing the best ﬁt). Nevertheless,
the value of p = 0.5 is theoretically preferred. The data is
smoothed with a 50 Ma moving average. Points are 10 Ma
intervals.

to today for models still satisfying astronomical constraints
[Shaviv , 2002b]. This gives µ∼>3.75p/(1.95p − 1)◦K. Com-
bining the two, we get µ∼>3.7◦K if p is unconstrained, or
µ∼>4.7( or 4.0)◦K if p = 1/2( or 1).

Using §3.2-3.3, we thus obtain µ = 6.5 ± 2.5◦K.

were estimates for both the radiative forcing and temper-
ature change of two geological periods which were partic-
ularly warm relative to today. One is the Cretaceous, at
about 100 Ma before present, and the second is the Eocene,
at 50 Ma.

Barron et al. [1995] estimated that the mid-Cretaceous
was 7 ± 2◦K warmer than today, and that it arose from an
increase of 8 ± 3.5W m−2 in the radiative budget. However,
Covey et al. [1996] point out that this estimate included
only the change from the increased amount of atmospheric
CO2 and it did not include the increased forcing associated
with surface albedo changes. Once taken into account, the
Hoﬀert and Covey [1992] estimate for the radiative forcing
increases to 15.7 ± 6.8W m−2. Their estimate for the tem-
perature increase is also larger at 9 ± 2◦K. We adopt the
Hoﬀert and Covey [1992] estimate here.

Covey et al. [1996] estimated the temperature and radia-
tive ﬂux increases associated with the Eocene. They are
4.3 ± 2.1◦K and 11.8 ± 3.6W m−2 respectively. The tem-
perature and forcings can be used to estimate the sensi-
tivity through λ = ∆T /∆F . The results for the Eocene
K W−1 m2 and λ =
and Cretaceous are λ = 0.37+0.20
−0.16
K W−1 m2 respectively. They are also summarized
0.57+0.44
−0.18
in ﬁg. 2 and table 1.

Without the eﬀect of cosmic rays (i.e., with the D term
removed in the model given by eq. 15), more of the re-
constructed temperature variability can be explained with
CO2, and the estimate range for λ broadens respectively to
λ = 0.36 ± 0.22◦K W−1 m2. More limits are given in table 1.
Note that this estimate is independent of α determined in
§2. The ﬁrst range for λ simply assumes that a CRF/climate
link exists, while the second quoted range, even neglects this
assumption.

3.2. CRF/∆T correlation over the Phanerozoic

The signiﬁcant correlation between CRF and tempera-
ture over the Phanerozoic was also used to place limits on
the ratio between CRF variations and temperature change.
Together with the results of §2 we can place a limit on λ.

In Shaviv and Veizer [2003], it was found that if ∆Ttrop
is approximated with ∆Ttrop = D [(ΦCR/Φ0)p − 1], where
p = 1/2 and Φ0 is the CRF today, then D = 8 ± 4◦K. Al-
most all the contribution to the error arises from our limited
knowledge of the actual amplitude of the CRF variations. If
we generalize to other power laws p between 0.25 to 1.5, and
repeat the procedure described in Shaviv and Veizer [2003],
we ﬁnd that

µ ≡ −Φ0

where we have taken δTglobal/δTtrop ≈ 1.5 as typically ob-
tained in GCMs [IPCC , 2001]. The reason the error does
not increase much once we introduce a range of p’s is be-
cause µ (but not D) is rather insensitive to p. Note also
that p = 1/2 is theoretically preferred [Yu, 2002; Harrison
and Aplin, 2001; Ermakov et al., 1997], and a small p is also
favored by the empirical data (see ﬁg. 1).

Using the result for α obtained in §2, we ﬁnd λ = µ/α =
K W−1 m2. where we quote the median λ and the
0.44+0.45

16th and 84th percentiles (1-σ). More details on the distri-
bution appear in ﬁg. 3 and table 1.

3.3. Bounds from the total T and ΦCR variations
over the Phanerozoic

Using the same Phanerozoic data and an altogether dif-
ferent set of argumentations, we can place additional limits
on λ and on µ. We do not know accurately how large are
the absolute CRF variations that give rise to the temper-
ature oscillation over the Phanerozoic (hence the relatively
large error on µ and D). Nevertheless, we know that there
is a maximum increase of ∼ 2◦K in the tropical temperature
above today’s tropical temperature, once averaged over the
50 Ma time scale [Veizer et al., 2000]. This approximately
corresponds to an increase of ∆T ∼ 3◦K globally. We as-
sume that this could arise by removing at most fmin ∼ 80%
of the LACC, which would give rise to a global cooling of
fmin∆FLACC ≈ fmin17W m−2. Namely,

λmin∼>

(17)

This is an absolute minimum for the climate sensitivity.
Otherwise, the CRF-temperature link observed over the
Phanerozoic would require too large a radiative budget
change to be explained by LACC variations.

A similar limit can be placed on µ. The largest in-
crease over the Phanerozoic of ∆T ∼ 3◦K relative to to-
day, and which can be attributed to CRF variation, can-
not arise from a ﬂux decrease larger than 85%, since larger
reductions are inconsistent with various astrophysical con-
straints. This implies µ∼>3.0p/(1 − 0.15p)◦K, if a relation of
the form ∆T ∝ Φp exists. Likewise, the maximum temper-
ature decrease over the Phanerozoic is about 2.5◦K over the
tropics, or ∼ 3.75◦K globally, while the astronomical con-
straints give a maximum ﬂux increase of about 95% relative

that CRF variations do not aﬀect the global climate (though
it does includes the small solar luminosity changes). We
also assume, as Gregory et al. [2002], that ∆T and ∆F
entering λ have Gaussian errors. The cases are: (1) Tem-
perature increase over the past century (following Gregory
et al. [2002]). (2) Temperature variations over 300 yrs of
solar cycles. (3) Warming since the LGM (following Hoﬀert
and Covey [1992] and Hansen et al. [1993]). (4) Cooling
relative to the Cretaceous (∼ 100 Ma, Hoﬀert and Covey
[1992]).
(5) Cooling relative to the Eocene (∼ 55 Ma,
following Covey et al. [1996]). And (6) Phanerozoic ∆T
vs. RCO2 (§3.1, following Shaviv and Veizer [2003]). We
assume that the temperature increase ∆T×2 following the
doubling of the atmospheric CO2 content corresponds to an
increase of 3.71W m−2 [Myhre et al., 1998].

SHAVIV: COSMIC RAYS AND CLIMATE SENSITIVITY

These estimates do not include however the possibility
that CRF variations aﬀect climate. To estimate this eﬀect,
we estimate the CRF diﬀerences between the two geological
periods and today using the CRF reconstruction described
in Shaviv [2002b]. We then calculate ∆FCR arising from the
CRF change and use ∆T = λ(∆F0 + ∆FCR) to obtain λ.

We ﬁnd that the CRF was 20% to 70% of the ﬂux today
during the mid-Cretaceous. Through the eﬀects on clouds,
this should have contributed towards an increase in temper-
ature, and therefore reduce our estimate for λ. During the
Eocene, ΦCR should have been between 0% and 20% higher
than today. From the 6 epochs described here, this is the
only case in which the eﬀect of the CRF is to increase the
estimate for the climate sensitivity.

The radiative forcing associated with the CRF variations
can be estimated using the value of α. Numerically, we ﬁnd
∆FCRF = (−10±10%)α = −1.4±1.5W m−2 for the Eocene
and ∆FCRF = (70 ± 40%)α = 10.0 ± 6.0W m−2 for the Cre-
taceous (if we limit ourselves to p between 1/2 and 1). The
K W−1 m2 for the Creta-
new estimates are λ = 0.36+0.24
−0.11
K W−1 m2 for the Eocene. (More
ceous, and λ = 0.42+0.25

3.5. Warming since the last glacial maximum

Several studies have attempted to estimate the global sen-
sitivity by comparing the temperature increase since the
last glacial maximum (LGM) with the radiative forcing
change. For example, Hoﬀert and Covey [1992] estimate
that a radiative forcing of ∆F = 6.7 ± 0.9W m−2 is re-
ponsible for a temperature increase of ∆T = 3 ± 0.6◦K.
On the other hand, Hansen et al. [1993] ﬁnd a higher sen-
sitivity. This is because they ﬁnd that a similar radia-
tive forcing of ∆F = 7.1 ± 1.5W m−2 is responsible for
a much larger ∆T = 5 ± 1◦K increase. The main diﬀer-
ence is that Hoﬀert & Covey base their temperature esi-
mate on the oceanic CLIMAP temperature reconstruction,
while Hansen et al. based theirs on land temperature prox-
ies. We will adopt the average temperature change and
increase the error to be conservative. Namely, we choose
∆T = 4 ± 1.5◦K. Similarly we take ∆F = 6.9 ± 1.5W m−2.
K W−1 m2 (as detailed in ﬁg. 2 and
This gives λ = 0.58+0.29

◦

Again, the above estimates do not include the net ra-
diative forcing change due to CRF modulation of the cloud
cover.

Christl et al. [1998] and Frank et al. [1997] assumed that
10Be ﬂux modulation on this time scale is primarily a result
of modulation by the varying geomagnetic ﬁeld. Using this
ﬂux they derived that the geomagnetic ﬁeld was about 50%
its present value at 20 ka before present. Moreover, the to-
tal eﬀect of the terrestrial ﬁeld is a ∼ 20% reduction of the
CRF penetrating down to ∼ 3km, where low altitude clouds
typically form [Compton, 1933]. Namely, the 50% reduction
in the global magnetic ﬁeld should correspond to a reduc-
tion of about 10% in the relevant CRF. i.e., ∆FCRF ≈ 0.1α.
This should be compared with the 7% variation over the
solar cycle.

Sharma [2002] relaxed the assumption that the 10Be ﬂux
modulation is predominantly terrestrial. By using indepen-
dent proxies for the terrestrial ﬁeld, he obtained that the
ﬁeld was only 30% lower than today, corresponding to a
∼ 6% reduction in the high energy CRF. The rest of the
10Be ﬂux variations, were attributed to a reduced solar mod-
ulation factor φ [Masarik and Beer , 1999], that at 20 ka was
about a 1/3 of its current day average value of ∼550 MeV.
If we take the expression for the CR diﬀerential number
ﬂux J(Ep, φ) given in Masarik and Beer [1999] and inte-
grate
EpJ(Ep, φ)dEp to get the total ﬂux reaching the
troposphere (i.e., with Ep∼>E0 ≈ 10GeV ), we ﬁnd that the
increased solar activity as borne out from the increased so-
lar modulation factor was responsible for an additional 6%

E0
R

∞

reduction in the high energy CRF. We therefore get a total
reduction of about 12% in the CRF, and ∆FCRF ≈ 0.12α.
We take this value.

Since we ﬁnd that a larger total radiative forcing is re-
sponsible for the same temperature change, we obtain a
K W−1 m2 (also detailed in
lower estimate, λ = 0.48+0.22
−0.16
ﬁg. 3 and table 1).

◦

Instead of using the radiative forcing through cloud cover
modiﬁcation, we can use our limits of µ which are not based
on LACC forcing, but instead on the observed temperature
change over the phanerozoic. We found µ = 6.5 ± 2.5◦K.
Thus, the 12% decrease in the CRF causing low altitude
tropospheric ionization should translate into a warming con-
tribution of ∆TCRF ≈ 4.8 to 10.8◦K warming. We now
use an equation of the form ∆T = λ(∆F0 + ∆FCRF ) ≡
λ∆F0 + ∆TCRF , and obtain: λ = 0.47+0.27
−0.19

K W−1 m2 .

To summarize, the eﬀect of the decreased CRF since the
LGM is to reduce our estimate for λ by about 20%, which
is smaller than the error in the estimate itself. This result is
valid also if we don’t believe the CRF-climate link is through
LACC moduation, but merely that such a link exists.

◦

3.6. Warming over the past century

Climate sensitivity can also be estimated using the global
warming observed over the past century once the radiative
forcing with their uncertainties are estimated.

Since the time scale is relatively short, it is necessary to
consider the ﬁnite heat capacity of the oceans. We base
our analysis here on the work of Gregory et al. [2002] who
tackled this problem by considering the heat ﬂux into the
ocean in the energy budget. The main diﬀerence between
our modiﬁed analysis here and that of Gregory et al. [2002],
is that we will also consider the radiative forcing associated
with the decreased CRF over the past century. Unlike the
warming since the LGM, where this was a small correction,
here it is will prove to be a notable one.

Figure 3. The Probability Distribution function for λ (and
∆T×2) obtained by comparing radiation budget diﬀerences
to temperature change over various time scales, assuming
that CRF variations do aﬀect the global climate through
modulation of the low altitude cloud cover, and that the
relation between cloud cover changes and radiative forcing
are given by the nominal range. The cases are the same as
in ﬁgure 2 with the added CRF eﬀect. In addition, we have
case (7) Global sensitivity from correlation between CRF
variations and temperature variations over the Phanerozoic.
No equivalent for this case exists in the previous set because
the CRF/climate link is required to explain this data. And
(8) Warming since the LGM assuming µ is given by the
CRF/temperature correlation over the Phanerozoic and not
necessarily through LACC variations.

SHAVIV: COSMIC RAYS AND CLIMATE SENSITIVITY

X - 7

Again, we assume that the CRF modulates the LACC

and that its radiative forcing is given in §2.

Gregory et al. [2002] compared the period 1850-1900 with
1950-1990. Since the CRF record does not go back far
enough, we need to use proxy data. A good choice is the
geomagnetic aa activity index. The advantage of the aa in-
dex is that it can directly compare the long secular trends
to variations over the solar cycle. In particular, we ﬁnd that
the secular increase between the two periods is roughly the
same as the total variation in the aa index over the solar
cycle. In both cases it is roughly 12nT. If we further assume
that the ratio between the secular CRF variations to those
over the solar cycle is similar to the ratio in the aa index,
we ﬁnd that the decrease in the ∼ 10 GeV CRF between
the above periods should be about 7%, the typical min to
max variations over the solar cycle. Using our estimate for
the radiative forcing change in §2, this corresponds to about
1.0 ± 0.4W m−2.

According to Gregory et al. [2002],

λ∆T = F − Q,

(18)

where F is the change in the radiative forcing (i.e., in the
energy balance), while Q is the average net heat ﬂux which
entered the oceans between the two periods.

In our modiﬁed case F = F 0 + F CRF , where F 0 is the
“standard” radiative forcing that was estimated by Gregory
et al. [2002] to be F 0 = −0.3 to 1W m−2. It includes an-
thropogenic, volcanic, solar luminosity and aerosol contri-
butions (with the last one contributing the largest uncer-
tainty). Q was estimated to be 0.32 ± 0.15W m−2 while
∆T = 0.335 ± 0.033◦K (all at 2σ).

Like Gregory et al. [2002], we assume that the errors have
a Gaussian distribution. Following their procedure, we cal-
culate the probability distribution function (PDF) for λ.
They are given in ﬁgs. 2,3, for the CRF and no-CRF cases.
The added complication in the CRF case is the extra PDF
for α, which implies that F CRF has a PDF itself. The PDF
obtained for the F CRF = 0 case is the same as the result of
Gregory et al. [2002].

◦

Inspection of ﬁg. 3 and table 1 reveals that λ =
K W−1 m2 at 1-σ conﬁdence. This is a clear re-
0.32+0.32
−0.10
duction from the results of Gregory et al. [2002], where the
lower 16th percentile for λ is 0.67◦K W−1 m2 and there is no
formal upper limit (This assumes a prior that λ cannot be
negative).

3.7. Variations over the solar cycle

The shortest time scale we study is that of the solar cy-
cle. Since the expected signal arising from solar variability
is small (∼ 0.1◦K) looking at the recent few cycles is prob-
lematic since internal variations (such as volcanic eruptions,
ENSO and other oscillations as well as simple inter-annual
variations, or “internal noise”) in the climate are large and
can drown the solar signal. To overcome this problem, we
will look at a much longer temperature record. In particular,
we use the post-Little Ice age data (i.e., last 300 yrs) of the
Jones et al. [1998] thousand year long reconstruction of tem-
perature for both hemispheres, which includes proxy data of
tree rings, ice cores, corals, and historical documents. The
catch is that the solar cycle is not stable, and the actual pe-
riod varies between about 9 and 12 years. To overcome this
problem, we do not perform a harmonic analysis. Instead,
we fold and average the data over the varying solar cycle
period. Namely, each year is asigned a phase φ deﬁned as
the time since last sunspot minimum devided by the length
of the particular cycle encompassing the given year. Once
we do so, we can average all points within a phase bin and
obtain the average temperature. Also, the internal variance
in the temperature allows us to estimate the error in ∆T (φ).
The result is depicted in ﬁgure 4.

Evident from the ﬁgure is the fact that the temperature
has a near sinusoidal behavior. By performing a χ2 ﬁt to a
form ∆T (φ) = ∆T +(a/2) cos(2π(φ−φ0)) with φ0 the phase
relative to the occurrence of maximum sunspot number, we
ﬁnd at the 1 − σ conﬁdence limit that:

◦
a = 0.09 ± 0.03
φ0 = 1.0 ± 0.6 rad.

K,

(19)
(20)

The value of φ0 implies that the average temperature lags
behind the maximum sunspot number by 1.8 ± 1.0 years.
This is to be expected, because of Earth’s ﬁnite heat capac-
ity. As a result, the response to radiative perturbations is
not only damped, but it is lagged as well.

Other analyses estimated the surface temperature varia-
tion over the 11-yr solar cycle. Douglass and Clader [2002]
found a = 0.11 ± 0.02◦K, while White et al. [1997] found
a = 0.10 ± 0.02◦K. Together with the current result, we
will adopt a = 0.10 ± 0.02◦K for the temperature variation
between solar minimum and solar maximum.

We now use the results of §2.

In particular, the above
temperature variations are assumed to arise from the ∼ 1.6%
variations observed in the LACC, such that the forcing over
the solar cycle is ∆FLACC = 1.0±0.4W m−2 . An additional
contribution of ∆Ff lux = 0.35W m−2 is due to changes in
the solar ﬂux. The sensitivity itself is then given by:

λ =

∆T /d
∆F

(21)

where d is a damping factor which arises from the ﬁnite heat
capacity of the climate system and its inability to reach equi-
librium at a ﬁnite time.

The value of the damping factor is not well known. In
principle, it can be obtained in climate models, but these
give a range of values. Using a simple Ocean/Climate
model, Schlesinger et al. [2004] obtained a damping of about
0.25 on the 11-yr solar cycle time scale (and about 0.75 on
the centennial time scale). Other more extensive simula-
tions ﬁnd that the 11-yr solar cycle is damped relative to
the centennial scale by a factor of ∼ 0.54 [Cubasch et al.,
1997], 0.33 [Rind et al., 1999] or by comparing solar forc-
ing to actual climate responce, to ∼ 0.68 [Waple et al.,
2002]. If we further consider that the centennial time scale

Figure 4. Plotted are average number of sunspots, the
global temperature and a sinosoidal ﬁt. The global surface
temperature is the reconstructed temperature over the past
300 yrs (with variations on time scales longer than 30 yrs
removed) folded over the solar cycle length. The average
sunspot number folded over the same cycle.

4 estimates for the damping factor are encompassed within
d = 0.35±0.15, for periodic oscillations with an 11-yr period.
Note that by resorting to GCMs for the estimate of the
damping factor, we are somewhat unfaithful to the spirit of
this work, which is to estimate the sensitivity independently
to the usage of GCM simulations. Nevertheless, the damp-
ing we use is a characteristic describing the relative behavior
of diﬀerent time scales. We still avoid using the absolute sen-
sitivity obtained in GCMs. Moreover, the analysis of [Waple
et al., 2002] does indicate that empirically, the damping fac-
tor is consistent with that obtained in GCMs. The fact that
this result is somewhat larger than GCMs on average, would
imply that we maybe underestimating the damping factor,
and with it, overestimating the climate sensitivity.

cases described in ﬁg. 2, when the CRF/climate link is
neglected, and the cases described in ﬁg.
3, when the
CRF/LACC eﬀect is included. We combine the results in
two cases. In the ﬁrst, we assume that the global tempera-
ture sensitivity is constant, namely, that it does not depend
on the average terrestrial temperature. In the second case,
we allow the sensitivity to be temperature dependent.

3.8.1. Constant Sensitivity

When combining the results under the assumption that
CRF does not introduce a radiative forcing, we can simply
multiply the PDFs and renormalize the result. The reason
is that the error in the estimates of all the ∆F0 and ∆T are
presumably uncorrelated with each other, and also because
we have no prior on the value of λ (except perhaps that it
should be positive).

On the other hand, when combining the cases which in-
clude the CRF/LACC eﬀect, we must bear in mind that
some of the error arises from the uncertainty in α – the rela-
tion between cloud cover changes and radiative forcing. This
uncertainty enters 5 PDFs, and we cannot simply multiply
them. To overcome this obstacle, we calculate the PDFs
assuming a given α. Then, the combined PDF is given by

Pall(λ) =

6
i=1 Pi(λ, α)
6
R (cid:2)Q
i=1 Pi(λ, α)
R (cid:2)Q

(cid:3)

Pα(α)dα

(cid:3)
Pα(α)dαdλ

.

(22)

Again, this assumes that we have no prior on λ, and that
besides the dependence on α, the PDFs are not in anyway
correlated with each other.

◦

In ﬁgs. 6,7 and table 1, we plot and describe the com-
bined PDFs obtained in the two cases. We ﬁnd that λ =
K W−1 m2 if the CRF/Climate link is neglected,
0.52+0.10

included. Values of upper and lower limits on λ and ∆T×2
at diﬀerent conﬁdence limits are given in Table 1.

3.8.2. Variable Sensitivity
We now alleviate the assumption of a constant sensitivity
and allow a linear relation in the form λ = λ0 + b∆T , where

though comparison of the tropical temperature to CRF variations (Ph1) or to CO2 variations (Ph2), Eocene
(Eo) and Mid-Cretaceous (Cr). Panel (a) assumes that the CRF contributes no radiative forcing while panel
(b) assumes that the CRF does aﬀect climate. Thus, the “Ph1” measurement is not applicable and does not
appear in panel (a). From the ﬁgures it is evident that: (i) The expectation value for λ is lower if CRF aﬀects
climate. (ii) The values obtained using diﬀerent paleoclimatic data are notably more consistent with each
other if CRF does aﬀect climate (iii) There is no signiﬁcant trend in λ vs. ∆T .

λ0 is the sensitivity today and b = dλ/dT . Because the er-
rors are not Gaussian (the distributions are generally skewed
towards higher λ’s) we cannot ﬁt λ(∆) using a simple linear
least squares. Instead, we calculate

Pall(λ0, b) =

ues of upper and lower limits on λ and ∆T×2 at diﬀerent

This is our best estimate for the global sensitivity.
It
translates into a CO2 doubling temperature change of
∆T×2 = 1.3±0.4◦K. With the CRF/climate eﬀect neglected,
this number is ∆T×2 = 2.0 ± 0.5◦K.

Another point worth mentioning is the fact that once the
CRF/LACC climate link is included, the median values for
λ obtained using diﬀerent periods diﬀer from each other by
typically 1-σ or less, while without the CRF/climate con-
sidered, diﬀerences can be larger than 2-σ. Namely, the
CRF/climate eﬀect markably improves the consistency of
the data. This can be seen in ﬁg. 5.

4. Discussion

We compared the radiative forcing and temperature
change over several diﬀerent time scales, while taking into
consideration the alleged link between CRF variations and
temperature change. We found that the 6 diﬀerent time
scales can be used to place similar bound on the global cli-
mate sensitivity and, when possible, also on the quantitative
relation between CRF variations and temperature changed.
Diﬀerent time scales and methods suﬀer from diﬀerent
uncertainties, which have to be kept in mind. These include:

1. Limits based on the geochemical record over the past
550 million years implicitly assume that estimates of temper-
ature variations using δ18O is well known. In principle, var-
ious biases might distort this relation and produce a wrong
temperature scale.

2. Limits based on large temperature variations and ra-
diative forcing, assume that one can deduce the sensitiv-
ity today, to small perturbations, from temperature changes
associated with large radiative forcings, or worse, when dif-
ferent conditions existed under which the sensitivity could
have been diﬀerent (e.g., over the past 550 milllion years
ice sheets where mostly absent). To address this point, we
allowed for λ to be a linear function of temperature, but
found no signiﬁcant dependence.

3. Most of the estimates of the climate sensitivity assume
the CRF/climate link is through modiﬁcation of the LACC
and that the radiative forcing associated with it is known.
This entails in it several assumptions:
(a) That LACC
changes observed by the ISCCP measurements, for exam-
ple, are indeed well represented by changes in the amount
of cloud cover as opposed to other cloud characteristics. (2)
That the incremental cloud cover changes behave as the av-
erage. (3) That tropospheric ionization does not markably
aﬀect the global temperature through an eﬀect not related
to cloud cover modiﬁcations. These uncertainties will not
be resolved without detailed understanding of how and to
what extent does atmospheric ionization aﬀects the forma-
tion of cloud condensation nuclei, which aﬀect cloud cover.
Nevertheless, the value of the sensitivity could still be in-
dependently bracketed using argumentation which does not
assume the relation is through the LACC variations.

4. Over the short time scales associated with the solar
cycle, one of the main uncertainties is the damping factor in
the eﬀect of a changed radiative forcing.

Having said that, the fact that about half a dozen in-
dependent analyses based on paleoclimatic to recent data
yield roughly the same sensitivity should indicate that we

X - 10

are probably not missing large radiative forcing terms. Oth-
erwise, there is no reason, other than chance, to obtain re-
sults consistent with each other. Moreover, the notably im-
proved agreement between the sensitivities obtained once
the CRF/climate eﬀect is taken into account, is yet another
indicator that the eﬀect is real (see panel A vs. B in ﬁg. 5).
Our best estimate is ∆T×2 ≈ 1.3◦K (0.9◦K < ∆T×2 <
2.5◦K at the 99% conﬁdence level). This is at the lower end
of the often quoted range of ∆T×2 = 1.5 to 4.5◦K [IPCC ,
2001] obtained from Global Circulation Models (GCMs).
Cess et al. [1989] have shown that the climate sensitivity
obtained in this type of simulations predominantly depends
on how clouds are treated, and whether they contribute a
positive or negative feedback. The models roughly give that
λ−1 ≈ 2.2W m−2/◦K − ∆Fcloud/∆ ¯T with ∆Fcloud being the
feedback forcing of clouds associated with a temperature
change of ∆ ¯T . Thus, for a GCM to be compatible with the
results obtained here, a negative cloud feedback is required.
One such example was suggested by Lindzen et al. [2001]

On the other side of the coin, we can also rule out very
small climate sensitivities. This can be used for example
to place a limit on possible large negative feedbacks, or to
a lower limit on the eﬀect of anthropogenic greenhouse gas
(GHG) warming.

Since the beginning of the industrial era (∼ 1750), non-
solar sources contributed a net forcing of 0.85 ± 1.3W m−2
[IPCC , 2001] (assuming the errors are Gaussian). Over the
past century alone, this number is 0.5 ± 1.3W m−2. The
main reason why the error is large is because of the uncer-
tain “indirect” contribution of aerosols, namely, their eﬀect
on cloud cover. It is currently estimated to be in the range
−1 ± 1W m−2 [IPCC , 2001]. Thus, anthropogenic sources
alone contributed to a warming of 0.13 ± 0.33◦K since the
beginning of the 20th Century.

The sensitivity result can also be used to estimate the
solar contribution towards global warming. Over the past

century, the increased solar activity has been responsible for
a stronger solar wind and a lower CRF. Using results of §3.6,
the reduced ionization and LACC were responsible for an
increased radiative forcing of 1.0 ± 0.4W m−2. In addition,
the globally averaged solar luminosity increased by about
0.4±0.1W m−2 according to Solanki and Fligge [1998]; Hoyt
and Schatten [1993]; Lean et al. [1995]. Thus, increased solar
activity is responsible for a total increase of 1.4±0.4W m−2 .
Using our estimate for λ, we ﬁnd ∆Tsolar = 0.37 ± 0.13◦K.
We therefore ﬁnd that the combined solar and anthro-
pogenic sources were responsible for an increase of 0.50 ±
0.35◦K. This should be compared with the observed 0.57 ±
0.17◦K increase in global surface temperature [IPCC , 2001].
In other words, the result we ﬁnd for the sensitivity and
drivers are consistent with the observed temperature in-
crease. The solar and anthropogenic contributions are com-
parable, nevertheless, it is more likely that the former con-
tribution is somewhat larger, contributing about 2/3s of the
observed temperature increase. This conclusion was inde-
pendently reached by comparing the non-monotonic tem-
perature increase with the non-monotonic solar activity in-
crease and the monotonic increase in GHGs [Soon et al.,
1996b].

We therefore conclude that both GHGs and solar vari-
ability are the main drivers of global warming, through a
temperature sensitivity that is notably lower than the whole
range obtained in GCMs. Its value is surprisingly close to
the black body value of 0.30◦K W−1 m2.

tion of the temperature. The the latter case, the distribution
for λ today is plotted. Also marked are the two additional
constraints obtained from the Phanerozoic data which do
not depend on the CRF/LACC link, as well as the sensi-
tivity range of 1.5 to 4.5◦K, which according to the IPCC
[2001] is “widely cited”. Note that the sensitivity range of
the 15 GCM models actually used by the IPCC [2001] is 2.0
to 5.1◦K.

It is evident that (i) the expectation for λ is lower once
the CRF/climate link is introduced. (ii) In both cases, there
is no clear dependence of λ on the temperature. Namely,

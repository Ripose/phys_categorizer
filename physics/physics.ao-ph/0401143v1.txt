Recent Atmosphere-Ocean Coupled General Circulation Model (AOGCM) simulations of the
twentieth century climate, which account for anthropogenic and natural forcings, make it possi-
ble to study the origin of long-term temperature correlations found in the observed records. We
study ensemble experiments performed with the NCAR PCM for 10 diﬀerent historical scenarios,
including no forcings, greenhouse gas, sulfate aerosol, ozone, solar, volcanic forcing and various
combinations, such as natural, anthropogenic and all forcings. We compare the scaling exponents
characterizing the long-term correlations of the observed and simulated model data for 16 represen-
tative land stations and 16 sites in the Atlantic Ocean for these scenarios. We ﬁnd that inclusion
of volcanic forcing in the AOGCM considerably improves the PCM scaling behavior. The scenar-
ios containing volcanic forcing are able to reproduce quite well the observed scaling exponents for
the land with exponents around 0.65 independent of the station distance from the ocean. For the
Atlantic Ocean, scenarios with the volcanic forcing slightly underestimate the observed persistence
exhibiting an average exponent 0.74 instead of 0.85 for reconstructed data.

While many modelers and climatologists focus their
studies on trends caused by natural and anthropogenic
forcings during the twentieth century [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
we here focus on another important aspect of temper-
ature anomalies - long-term correlations. One of the
ﬁrst studies on the question how general circulation mod-
els reproduce observed climate variability was performed
by [7]. Using power spectrum analysis, which is aﬀected
by nonstationarities in time series, they argue that the
GFDL AOGCM reproduced the natural climate vari-
ability on decadal and centennial scales correctly for a
1000 year control run integration. Several recent stud-
ies of [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] clearly demonstrate that
surface air temperature (SAT) anomalies are long-term
correlated with a ﬂuctuation exponent α close to 0.65.
On the other hand, results of [15, 16, 17, 18, 19] indi-
cate that AOGCMs underestimate surface air temperture
(SAT) persistence for control run, greenhouse gas forc-
ing only and greenhouse gas forcing plus sulfate aerosols
scenarios.
In contrast, recent studies of reconstructed
data [20, 21] claim that inner continental regions do not
show long-term correlations, and thus AOGCMs success-
fully reproduce the natural persistence for the control run
and greenhouse gas forcing only scenarios. Recently, this
claim was tested on observed records by [22] with the
ﬁnding that the SAT ﬂuctuation exponents for continen-

tal sites do show long-term correlation and the α values
do not depend on the distance of the site from the ocean.
In this Letter we show that the recent PCM model
simulations properly reproduce the observed long-term
correlations for SAT on land only for those scenarios that
include volcanic forcing. These scenarios also show bet-
ter scaling performance over the ocean than the other
scenarios.

In order to present the land-surface temperature proﬁle
for the last century, 16 observed daily maximum tem-
perature time series are considered. They have been
collected from diﬀerent representative weather stations
around the globe for the following sites: Vancouver,
Tucson, Cheyenne, Luling, Brookings, Albany, Oxford,
Prague, Kasan, Tashkent, Surgut, Chita, Seoul, Jakutsk,
Melbourne and Sydney. We also analyze the gridded
monthly mean sea surface temperature (SST) for 16
sites in the Atlantic ocean with a spatial resolution of
2.5ox2.5o for the period of 1900 − 2002 from the Kaplan
Extended SSTA data set (see also [23]). For 1900 − 1981
this is the analysis of [24] which uses optimal estimation
in the space of 80 empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs)
in order to interpolate ship observations of the U.K. Me-
teorological Oﬃce database [25]. The data after 1981
consists of gridded data from the National Center for
Environmental Prediction optimal interpolation analysis,
which combines ship observations with remotely sensed
data [26]. This analysis is performed on the same set of
80 EOFs as used in [24] in order to provide enhanced
data quality.

The model considered in our study is the Parallel Cli-
mate Model (PCM), which was developed at the Na-
tional Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). It is a

fully coupled global ocean-atmosphere-sea ice-land sur-
face model that produces a stable climate without ﬂux
adjustment. The horizontal resolution of the atmosphere
is equivalent to 2.8ox2.8o, with 18 levels in the verti-
cal. Resolution of the ocean is roughly 2/3o, increasing
to 1/2o at the equator, with 32 levels. The detailed de-
scription of the model and results from experiments using
various forcings and their combinations may be found in
[3, 27, 28] and [4].

Here we study 10 forcing combinations: no forcings,
greenhouse gas, sulfate aerosol, ozone, solar, volcanic,
solar + volcanic, ozone + solar + volcanic, greenhouse
gas + sulfate aerosol + ozone, all forcings. Greenhouse
gas forcing is based on historical observations of CO2,
N2O, CH4, CFC-11, CFC-12, and ozone [28]. Evolution
of direct forcing from tropospheric sulfate aerosol is re-
ported by [29]. Historical changes of solar irradiance
were reconstructed by [30] and volcanic forcing by [4].
The period of all experiments is 1890-1999.

For the no forcings and solar+volcanic scenarios we
analyze the available 3-member ensembles, whereas for
other scenarios 4-member ensembles are available. For
each scenario, we selected the temperature records of the
4 grid points closest to each site, and bilinearly interpo-
lated the data to the location of the observed site.

For each record, we analyse daily (or monthly) tem-
perature anomalies ∆Ti. The ∆Ti are called long-term
correlated if their autocorrelation function C(s) decays
with time lag s by a power law

C(s) ∼ s−γ,

0 < γ < 1.

(1)

To overcome possible nonstationarities in the data, we
do not calculate C(s) directly.
Instead we construct
the “proﬁle” Yn = Pn
i=1 ∆Ti and study the ﬂuctua-
tion function F (s) of the proﬁle in segments of length s
by using the second order detrended ﬂuctuation analysis
(DFA2) [31, 32]. In DFA2 we determine in each segment
the best second-order polynomial ﬁt of the proﬁle. The
standard deviation of the proﬁle from these polynomials
represents the square of the ﬂuctuations in each segment.
The ﬂuctuation function F (s) is the root mean square
of the ﬂuctuations in all segments. For the relevant case
of long-term power-law correlations given by Eq. (1),
with 0 < γ < 1, the ﬂuctuation function F (s) increases
according to a power law,

F (s) ∼ sα,

α = 1 −

.

For uncorrelated data (as well as for short-range corre-
lations represented by γ ≥ 1 or exponentially decaying
correlation functions), we have α = 1
2 . For long-term
correlations we have α > 1
2 .

First we plot the results of DFA2 (DFA curves of higher
order show the same performance) for the observed daily
maximum temperature (Figure 1a) and NCAR PCM sim-
ulations from the B06.61 run (Figure 1b). Run B06.61
represents one of the runs from the all forcings ensemble.

FIG. 1: DFA2 ﬂuctuation functions F (s) for the daily sur-
face air maximum temperature anomalies at 10 land sites: (a)
observed data and (b) NCAR PCM B06.61 (all forcings) sim-
ulated data. The scale of F (s) is arbitrary. The straight lines
crossing each curve represent the best asymptotic ﬁt. The
two lines shown at the bottom have slopes 0.65 and 0.5.

All curves are shown in a double logarithmic presenta-
tion. We plot 10 typical DFA curves chosen from our 16
sites over land. The sites chosen include coastal, near
coastal, and inland locations.

The approximate period of the observed records is
1880-1990, with the maximum length for Prague (1775-
1992) and the minimum for Seoul (1908-1993). The pe-
riod of the B06.61 run is 1890-1999. The slopes in Figure
1a correspond to ﬂuctuation exponents of the observed
SAT anomalies, and vary from 0.62 to 0.68, with an av-
erage close to 0.65. Figure 1a demonstrates that SAT
anomalies for all sites studied obey long-term power-law
correlations independent of the distance from the near-
est ocean. The slopes in Figure 1b range from 0.62 to
0.69. Comparing Figures 1a and 1b shows that the scal-
ing of the NCAR PCM output agrees quite well with the
scaling of the observed data over land.

Figure 2 shows DFA2 curves for the 10 sites in the At-
lantic ocean for the Kaplan reconstructed monthly SST
anomalies (Figure 2a) and for the NCAR PCM monthly
averaged SST anomalies from the all forcings B06.61 run
(Figure 2b). The slopes for the reconstructed SSTA
vary from 0.71 in the equatorial part of the Atlantic to
1.0 in the Northern Atlantic, with an average of 0.85.
The SSTA exponents characterizing the memory eﬀect on
decadal and centennial scales seem to depend on complex
ocean circulation dynamics. The variation of the scaling
exponents over the Atlantic Ocean is signiﬁcantly larger
than on land, which is probably due to diﬀerent ocean cir-
culation patterns in equatorial, mid-latitude, and high-
latitude regions.
In a double logarithmic presentation,
the slopes of the DFA2 curves for the simulated ocean
records have an average of 0.72 which is noticeably lower

FIG. 2: DFA2 ﬂuctuation functions F (s) for monthly sea sur-

than the observed average of 0.85.

Figure 3 presents the ﬂuctuation exponent distribution
for the observed data and for the 10 NCAR PCM scenar-
ios considered for the 16 land locations. In each panel
the “grey” column in the range [0.62,0.68) represents the
distribution of the ﬂuctuation exponents for the observed
data. As seen from the ﬁgure, scenarios containing vol-
canic forcing best reproduce the observations since they
have a peak at the same range [0.62-0.68) as the observed
data. Their average ﬂuctuation exponent is close to 0.65.
In contrast, the other six scenarios that do not contain
volcanic forcing, have an average ﬂuctuation exponent
for land less than 0.6 (see also [17]).

Similar behavior is found over the Atlantic Ocean.
Only those scenarios containing the volcanic forcing ex-
hibit an average ﬂuctuation exponent greater than 0.7
with the largest value equal to 0.76 for the volcanic forc-
ing only scenario. Figure 4 shows the ﬂuctuation expo-
nent distribution for the Atlantic Ocean for the Kaplan
data (in grey) and for 10 studied scenarios (in black).
Thus the PCM underestimates the ﬂuctuation exponents
obtained for reconstructed data for the Atlantic Ocean by
10-15%.

Therefore, we can conclude that for the NCAR PCM
addition of volcanic forcing to any other forcing combi-
nation immediately improves its scaling behavior both
for the land and the ocean. This fact suggests that (be-
sides the atmosphere-ocean coupling) the volcanic forc-
ing is mostly responsible for the presence of the long-
term correlations in the NCAR PCM over land on annual
and decadal scales. For the ocean, the addition of vol-
canic forcing leads to stronger memory and consequently
higher ﬂuctuation exponents comparing to those for the

FIG. 3: Histograms of the ﬂuctuation exponents α for the
observed records (grey column) and the simulated records, for
land stations. The considered 10 scenarios are: no forcings,
greenhouse gas (G), sulfate (Su), ozone (Oz), solar (S), vol-
canic (V), solar + volcanic (S+V), ozone + solar + volcanic
(Oz+S+V), greenhouse gas + sulfate + ozone (G+Su+Oz),
and all forcings. Four bins in each panel correspond to α in
the intervals [0.5,0.56), [0.56,0.62),[0.62,0.68), and [0.68,0.74]
respectively. The grey column in each panel corresponds to
the ﬂuctuation exponent distribution for the observed records,

land. However the NCAR PCM still underestimates the
observed persistence of the oceans.

The main conclusion from our research is that the
NCAR PCM is able to reproduce the scaling behavior of
the observed land SAT records for the last century after
taking into account all historically based natural and an-
thropogenic forcings. However, even the best scenario for
the land slightly underestimates natural SST persistence
in the ocean, possibly due to errors in the simulations
of deep ocean circulation, the atmosphere-ocean interac-
tion, and/or an insuﬃciently long spin up period of the
ocean component of the AOGCM.

The results presented in this letter may also help to
clarify the controversy about the values of SAT ﬂuctu-
ation exponents for inner continental regions (see [20]).
Our study indicates that not only the observed records
for inner continental regions are long-term correlated in
agreement with [22], but also the recent PCM simu-
lations for these regions show similar ﬂuctuation expo-
nents, characteristic of long-term persistence.

Finally, this letter also supports the suggestion of [17]
that the inability of the seven leading AOGCMs, for their
control runs, greenhouse gas forcing only, and greenhouse
gas plus aerosols scenarios, to mimic the observed SAT
persistence is caused by the absence of natural forcings, in
particular volcanic forcing. The results of our detrended

4

ﬂuctuation analysis for the 16 land stations around the
globe and the 16 sites in the Atlantic ocean suggest that
volcanic forcing has by far the largest impact on the
AOGCM long-memory persistence.

Abstract

A possible relationship between sunspot number and total annual
precipitation from the Iza˜na Observatory has been found. The annual
precipitation period ranges from 1916 to 1998, thus including nearly
eight 11–year solar cycles.

When points of total precipitation for a given year at Iza˜na are
plotted on the ordinate axis versus the yearly sunspot number on the
abcisa axis three years back from the precipitation one, nearly all of
them lie in the lower left hand corner of the diagram. This seems to
indicate a relationship between the above mentioned variables.

If this relationship is conﬁrmed it would permit the prediction of a

maximum annual precipitation at Iza˜na three years in advance.

Introduction

Many relationships between sunspot number and precipitation have been
found. The most simple one plotting sunspot number, or a similar re-
lated quantity, and some direct or indirect measurement of precipitation

1

versus the year when the events took place. Sometimes one of the plotted
variables is lagged several years. A visual correlation or anti–correlation
is normally found. Some examples are the controversial water levels of
lake Victoria [Brooks, 1923], the lake Michigan water levels [Wilson, 1946],
the Mississippi river ﬂow [Perry, 1996], the drought cycles in the western
United States [Mitchell et al., 1979] or the also controversial Indian cyclones
[Meldrum, 1872]. Another technique is to calculate the power spectrum
of the time series with sensitive methods like maximum entropy methods.
Some examples are the summer Nile ﬂoods [Currie, 1987] and the Atlantic
tropical cyclones [Cohen and Sweetser, 1975]. For more sun–climate rela-
tionships see the excellent reviews from V´azquez [V´azquez, 1998], Hoyt and
Schatten [Hoyt and Schatten, 1997 ] and Pittock [Pittock, 1983].

More recent and closer examples can be found in the work of Jonsson et
al. [Jonsson et al., 2000], where they analyze the Iza˜na precipitation and the
tree rings of the Canarian pines and ﬁnd that during long drought periods
there is a strong minima in tree ring growth, but more conspicuous minima
happen during a phase of maximum solar activity. Alves [Alves, 2000] ﬁnds
a correlation between yearly sunspot number and precipitation in Portugal,
which is very strongly inﬂuenced by Atlantic meteorological perturbations
like is also frequently the case in the Canary islands.

In this paper we will show a diﬀerent type of relationship between pre-
cipitation and sunspots. Its main feature is that if it is conﬁrmed, it will
permit some type of long term precipitation prediction. We will ﬁrst present
the diﬀerent datasets used in this paper and show their relationship. A sta-
tistical test will be made on the sample to see how well the relationship
holds. Finally, if the relationship is really produced by cause and eﬀect we
will show how precipitation predictions can be made and will point some
possible physical factors behind it.

2 The precipitation dataset

The data was obtained from the local West Canaries Meteorological Cen-
ter (“Centro Meteorol´ogico Territorial de Canarias Occidental”) which be-
longs to the Spanish Meteorological Institute (“Instituto Nacional de Meteo-
rolog´ıa”). The time series consists of the total annual precipitation registered
from 1916 to 1998 inclusive at the Meteorological Iza˜na Observatory.

The Meteorological Iza˜na Observatory is located at 28◦18′N, 16◦29′W on
the island of Tenerife (Canary Islands) at 2367 m above sea level. There is
generally a strong and persistent subsidence inversion over this region with

and big points. Over it is drawn the 5 year running mean with a dotted line
for illustrative purposes. At the bottom is shown the yearly sunspot number
with a solid line.

the top located at about 1200 m in summer and about 1800 m in winter.
The Observatory normally lies above the top of the inversion layer although
it sometimes reaches the station under certain synoptic conditions. This is
why Iza˜na is considered a very good station for representative atmospheric
measurements of the free troposphere.

The time series of basic meteorological parameters from this Observatory
began in the 1916 when the Iza˜na Observatory was founded. Since then
the keen work of the Observers has provided us with such a long record.
Although the precipitation is a diﬃcult parameter to measure because it is
not easy to devise an instrument which will collect all the rainfall with few
errors, it is not severely aﬀected by the time when the measurement of the
total collected precipitation is done, neither is it very sensitive to other local
conditions like temperature, humidity, etc. Note that in the precipitation
series not all years from 1916 to the present are available. The reason for
this is that some years are not yet available in digital format.

3 The sunspot dataset

The yearly mean sunspot number, Ri, is obtained from the United States Na-
tional Geophysics Data Center (NGDC) at http://web.ngdc.noaa.gov which
consists of the yearly mean of the well known International Sunspot Number.
Brieﬂy, the International Sunspot Number, Ri, results from a statistical
treatment of the data originating from more than twenty–ﬁve observing sta-
tions. Normally sunspots appear isolated or forming groups. Each isolated
cluster of sunspots is termed a sunspot group, and it may consist of one or
a large number of distinct spots. The relative sunspot number is deﬁned
as R = K(10g + s), where g is the number of sunspot groups and s is the
total number of distinct spots. The scale factor K (usually less than unity)
depends on the observer and is intended to bring all measurements to the
same scale.

4 Relationship between total annual precipitation

and yearly sunspot number

The total annual precipitation and the yearly sunspot number time series is
shown in Figure 1 along with the 5 year running mean for the precipitation.
There does not seem to exist any clear relationship between the two vari-
ables. But if the three year lagged yearly sunspot number versus the total
annal precipitation at Iza˜na is plotted, we obtain Figure 2. It can be seen
that the points concentrate on the lower left hand corner of the graph. Even
more, we can plot the line P = 1250 − 4.25Ri, which is also shown in the
ﬁgure, below which nearly all points lie.

In a sense it is normal to expect this distribution of points if we assume
that both variables are totally independent since most values of precipitation
and sunspot number are in the lower range of all possible values. The
histogram of total annual precipitation is shown in Figure 3, its range is
from 0 to 1400 mm and peaks at around 300 mm. The histogram of yearly
sunspot number is shown in Figure 4, its range is from 0 to 190 and peaks
at around Ri = 20.

A statistical test can be performed on the data to check whether this
distribution is due to chance or not. The dataset is divided in two samples
by selecting points with a total annual precipitation higher and lower than

number are totally independent variables then these two samples should
be homogeneous, that is, the sunspot number histogram from each of the

there are very few points.

two samples should be the same in a statistical sense.
In Figure 4 the
three year lagged sunspot number histograms are shown, both for points
with precipitation above the median, 413.2 mm, and below it. The actual
numbers from these histograms are shown in Table 1. Note that the last
four histogram intervals of Figure 4 have been grouped into one in Table 1
so that it is statistically signiﬁcant.

Let us denote the sample number with i, diﬀerentiating data points
with precipitation above and below the median; the class number with j,
indicating the histogram interval of lagged sunspot number; the number
of years in a speciﬁed interval and sample with nij; the total number of
years under each sample with ni; the total number of years under each class
with mj; and the total number of years with n. We can make a chi–square
test to test the null hypothesis, H0, that both samples are homogeneous by
calculating the parameter

which should follow a chi–square distribution with three degrees of free-

dom. Calculating λ with the values from Table 1 we get

3;0.05 and we can conclude that the null hypothesis
is false. In other words, if we assume both samples are really homogeneous
there is less than 5% probability that the observed samples are produced
by chance. We thus conclude, with a high degree of conﬁdence, that both
samples are not independent and there is eﬀectively a relationship between
both variables.

5 Maximum precipitation prediction with sunspot

number

If we believe that there is really a cause and eﬀect relationship between both
variables, predicting the maximum precipitation for Iza˜na is straightforward.
We ﬁrst get the value of yearly sunspot number for a given year, Ri. Three

respect to precipitation. With a dotted line is shown the histogram with all
years with available precipitation data. The dashed line shows the histogram
of data points above the median total annual precipitation, 413.3 mm. The
solid line shows the histogram of data points below the median total annual
precipitation, 413.3 mm.

years later, the maximum precipitation at Iza˜na most probably will not
exceed the value given by the line shown on Figure 2, P = 1250 − 4.25Ri.

6 Discussion and possible physical causes

As in any statistical relationship there can be many errors along the way,
so this result should be taken with care. The measurement of precipitation
is not an easy task and is prone to errors. Depending on the wind and the
position of the pluviometer the collected water can be very diﬀerent from
the actual rainfall. This is even more complicated when the precipitation
consists of snow. Even though a relationship seems to exist, this does not
necessarily mean they form a true cause and eﬀect relationship. The fact
that the relationship is found at Iza˜na might be due to the fact that it is an
atmospheric background site due to its position and altitude. In any case,
study of other meteorological data should be done to strengthen or diminish

such relationship.

Currently, in the literature, there are two possible physical links between
sunspot number and some terrestrial variable which lags the sunspot number
in about three years.

One of such physical links is the inﬂuence on the terrestrial magnetic
It is well known that the maximum value for the
ﬁeld by solar activity.
aa geomagnetic index usually follows sunspot maximum by two or more
years. In the same way, the aurorae follow by about three years the sunspot
maximum.
It has been proposed that the solar activity modulates the
cosmic rays, which in turn aﬀect terrestrial climate [Tinsley et al., 1989,
Svensmark and Friis-Christensen, 1997]. Recently [Svensmark, 2000] it has
been noted that there is a signiﬁcant correlation of magnetic activity with
low level clouds (< 3Km).

Another physical link, which is most often cited in the literature, is the
diﬀerent heating eﬀect due to changes in solar irradiance with Sun activ-
ity. An example is the correlation of sea surface temperature with solar
irradiance [Reid, 1991], which also has an approximate lag of three years.
Recently [White et al., 2000] proposed a form of solar irradiance excitation
of Earth’s climate.

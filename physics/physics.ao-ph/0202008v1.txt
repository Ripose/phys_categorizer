ﬂuctuations from deterministic component of the signals are evidences of an intrinsic link between
the periodic behavior of AI and its ﬂuctuations. We prove that these time series are well described
by a stochastic dynamical model. Moreover, the principal peak in the power spectrum of these

INTRODUCTION

Over the last two decades, much attention has been de-
voted to study stochastic resonance (SR) as a model for
many kinds of physical phenomena. The term ”stochas-
tic resonance” describes a phenomenon whereby a weak
signal can be ampliﬁed and optimized by the presence
of noise. Stochastic resonance was introduced by Benzi
et al.
[1, 2] and Nicolis [3] in the ﬁeld of the physics
of atmosphere to explain the periodic recurrent ice ages.
They used the two levels Budyko-Sellers potential [4] for
describing the incoming and outcoming radiation and
added to it a weak periodic forcing, representing the
small modulation of the Earth’s orbital eccentricity and
a noise corresponding to variations on small time-scale
respect to eccentricity. They found that the presence
of the noise ampliﬁes the periodic component, facilitat-
ing the jump of the system between the two levels syn-
chronously with the periodical forcing. So they obtained
ice ages as a peak, in the power spectrum of a temper-
ature record, centered around the 100000 year period
and characterized by the correct amplitude. Since then,
stochastic resonance has been observed in a large variety
of physical systems, including bistable ring lasers, semi-
conductor devices, chemical reactions and neurophysio-

logical systems [5].
cently it appears another application of the SR. In fact,
in 1994 El-Ni˜no-Southern-Oscillation has been modeled

with stochastic resonance with a periodic forcing of ﬁve
years [6, 7] i.e.
stochastic resonance is conjectured to
have some relevance also at local climate scale. From
these works, however, it seems to be a strong link be-
tween the ﬂuctuations in the atmospheric medium (hu-
midity, temperature, wind speed and direction, industrial
emission and urban pollution) and the dynamics, that
describes the atmospheric behavior on larger spatial and
temporal scales. In this paper, we want to reconsider the
relevance of SR on global climate scale but on smaller
time scale, considering that periodic behaviours of Earth
motion could induce stochastic resonance. In this study,
we consider time-series representing distribution of tro-
pospheric aerosols that surely are aﬀected by Earth’s rev-
olution and rotation motions. Actually much attention
is devoted to a better understanding of the aerosol role
in the radiation budget [8]. The aerosol eﬀect on cli-
mate is quantiﬁed in terms of radiative forcing, namely
the net variation of radiation ﬂux at the top of the at-
mosphere due only to radiative aerosol eﬀects. A cooling
eﬀect of some aerosol (ash and sulfate aerosols) is well-
documented [9], while other types absorb solar radiation
(dust, carbonic and silicaceous aerosols). At present,
there are many activities addressed to study the opti-
cal properties of anthropogenic aerosols, for determining
their inﬂuence on the radiative forcing [10, 11]. The ﬁnd-
ing of SR into time series from troposheric aerosol should
give some new insight on this topic.

II. DATASETS

‡Electronic address: mona@imaaa.pz.cnr.it

We extracted time-series to analyze from the archive
of TOMS (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer) Aerosol

Index (AI hereafter). In particular we use the data re-
trieved from the measurements eﬀected by Nimbus 7, an
eliosynchronous satellite orbiting around the Earth from
November 1978 to May 1993. The AI was determined
using the backscattered radiances (I340, I380) measured
by TOMS at 340 and 380nm in the following way:

AI = −100

(cid:18)

(cid:18)

where the subscripts meas and theor indicate respec-
tively measured and theoretically computed quantities
[12]. This parameter gives an information on the aerosol
optical depth and strongly depends on aerosol
layer
height and on the optical properties of the aerosols [13].
The AI is deﬁned in such a way that it is positive for UV
absorbing aerosols and negative for no absorbing ones,
even if it assumes small negative values when absorbing
aerosols are near the Earth’s surface, up to 1.5 km [13].
It is important to underline that the clouds are charac-
terized by a null AI, but their inﬂuence on the measure-
ments is not negligible.
In fact the presence of clouds
can act as a screen for the detection operations, at least
in the case of clouds covering large areas [12]. The data
have a spatial resolution of 1o latitude x 1.25o longitude
(corresponding to 50km x 50km) and temporal resolu-
tion of one sample a day. At this time, we consider only
a restricted area relative to Italy with the following geo-
graphical coordinates (7 − 18oE; 36 − 47oN ). To reduce
the clouds contribution on our data, we used the reﬂec-
tivity data from TOMS as parameter to distinguish the
case of obscuring clouds from not one. If the reﬂectiv-
ity exceeds a threshold of 25%, we consider the AI as
corrupted by clouds and we corrected this sample replac-
ing the experimental value with the previous one plus a
quantity chosen randomly among 0, 0.1 and −0.1, where
0.1 is the instrumental error. The physical hypothesis
underlying this correction is the small variability of the
aerosol content in two days on a area of 50km x 50km.
Moreover we have to take into account that the Nimbus
7 stability period started from the 1984, so we consider
time-series extended from January 1984 up to May 1993
[14].

III. ANALYSIS

The ﬁrst step in examining AI data is to use standard
linear and nonlinear analysis techniques to prove that
we are in presence of a dynamics intrinsically stochas-
tic. In ﬁg. 1 we can see one scalar time-series and its
power spectrum. The power spectrum shows two evident
peaks: the principal peak corresponds to an annual pe-
riod, while the second one is related to a period of about
6 days. For upgrading our knowledge about the dynam-
ics generating these signals, as a ﬁrst step, we apply the
Independent Component Analysis (ICA) ([15] and refer-
ence therein). It is a well established method, based on

tribution from deterministic one. So we may conclude
that the periodic part of the signal is intrinsically tied to
the ﬂuctuations, i.e. our signals are generated by a gen-
uine stochastic dynamics. Another conﬁrmation of the
stochastic nature of the dynamics can be derived from
estimating embedding dimension. This estimate is made
applying the False Nearest Neighbors method [17] to a
single record: we obtain that up to dimension equal to
10 the algorithm does not converge as in the case of a
stochastic process. In conclusion analyzing time series,
it seems to be plausible to conjecture the presence of a
mechanism of SR acting between the stochastic noise and
the annual periodicity. It is important stressing that, if
we conjecture SR as a global mechanism, it is also true
that the parameters that rules the SR (local radiation
budget and insolation) are characteristic of the site lo-
cation. So it is clear that these parameters, as well as
the noise level, depend on the width of the investigated
area. In this ﬁrst step, we focalize our attention on Italy
(7 − 18oE; 36 − 47oN ): we choose this particular area for
investigating the contributes of both antrophic and nat-
ural aerosol sources and their mutual inﬂuence. Thus we
have extracted 99 recorded series considering each one
of them as a realization of the same stochastic process
in a diﬀerent spatial point. Since a comparison between
two stochastic process can be made only on average, we
have to extract the average series of experimental data
that will be compare with that derived from the model.
In this ﬁrst analysis we devote our attention only to the
dominant annual peak, so we execute a pass-band linear
ﬁlter in the range of 10−9 − 10−6 Hz. Successively, we
eliminate from the signal a trend that can be ascribed to
a residual trace of the satellite instability, obtaining the
time-series represented in Fig.3. Now, ﬁnally, we have the
experimental average time-series to be compared with the
one derived from a simulated model.

IV. MODELLING

We have to mark two goals, the ﬁrst is to numeri-
cally prove that our physical system can be eﬀectively
described with a resonance model, the second one is to
make the best ﬁt of the involved parameters and to give
a physical interpretation of them. In the framework of
[1, 2], we described our
the model used by Benzi et al.
physical system by means of the following equation:

dx =

x − x3
a (cid:19)

(cid:20)(cid:18)

+ Acos(ωt)

dt + ν

(cid:21)

So we have considered a double well potential repre-
senting the radiative balance of incoming and outcoming
radiation at the top of the atmosphere, that should be
directly correlated with the diﬀerent height of the aerosol
layers in winter and summertime. This potential is com-
pletely characterized by the gap between them (gap that
we indicate with a). The periodical component has a

frequency of 3.2 ∗ 10−8 Hz, corresponding to the annual
peak, and amplitude A. This term is included to take
into account the change of daily insolation with the solar
declination angle. Because the short period disturbances
can be described as a random walk [18], the noise has
been included as a Wiener process multiplied for a diﬀu-
sion coeﬃcient ν. The estimate of parameters will give
us the noise level, the amplitude of periodic forcing and
then the estimate of diﬀerence between the two levels.
Bearing in mind that, in regime of SR, the oscillation
amplitude is equal to a, we ﬁx this parameter in agree
with the experimental average at the value of 0.3636. So
we have reduced the problem to determine the value of
two parameters to better approximate our experimental
signal.

Tuning the parameters we realize the time scale con-
ditions [5] ﬁnding the values that give us a maximum
correlation integral between the mean value of the simu-
lated stochastic process (obtained from 100 realizations
for each value of the parameters) and the averaged ex-
perimental signal. In this way we ﬁnd a maximum cor-

relation integral of 0.71 corresponding to a dimension-
less level noise of about 0.06 and an amplitude of pe-
riodic forcing equals to 437 ∗ 10−4. The last quantity
corresponds to the 10 percent of insolation variation over
Italy, respect to the clear day solar insolation (estimated
as 1000W/m2). With this simulation, we have the esti-
mation of the parameters describing our system and we
can also reconstruct the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) be-
havior as function of the noise strength. The SNR curve
represented in Fig.4 is characteristic of the stochastic res-
onance [5]: this conﬁrms us that the AI dynamics can be
described with a SR mechanism. Moreover the best ap-
proximating signal corresponds to a noise level of ν=0.06,
so in this curve of resonance we are around the maximum.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The stochastic nature of the atmospheric medium is
a well-established reality, but the enhancing function of

4

this component is a no-trivial one. In this paper, we have
proved that the Aerosol Index dynamics over Italy can
be described through a stochastic resonance model and in
addition we have found that we are eﬀectively in stochas-
tic resonance regime. This is an important aim, because
it is the ﬁrst time that SR is observed in atmospheric
physics on human time scale. Surely this could be a fun-
damental tool for a better understanding of atmospheric
dynamics, in particular for what concerns the links be-
tween the mechanism of global circulation and the local
processes of aerosolic production and distribution. More-
over the presence of an atmospheric SR mechanism on a
small time scale for the Aerosol Index has certainly some
direct and indirect eﬀects on other relevant atmospheric
parameters such as the water vapor and precipitable wa-
ter atmospheric contents, because of the aerosol’s role as
condensation nuclei.

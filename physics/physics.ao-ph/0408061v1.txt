Solution of a Model for the Oceanic Pycnocline Depth: Scaling
of Overturning Strength and Meridional Pressure Diﬀerence
A. Levermann and A. Griesel
Climate System Department, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Potsdam, Germany

We present an analysis of the model by Gnanadesikan
[1999] for the pycnocline depth in the ocean. An analytic
solution for the overturning strength as a function of the
meridional pressure diﬀerence is derived and used to discuss
their mutual scaling. We show that scaling occurs only in
two unphysical regimes of the model. In the absence of the
Southern Ocean (SO) processes, i.e. for a northern overturn-
ing cell, the volume transport is proportional to the square
root of the pressure diﬀerence. Linear scaling is seen when
the overturning is restricted entirely to the SO, i.e. when
no northern downwelling exists. For comparison, we present
simulations with the coupled climate model CLIMBER-3α
which show linear scaling over a large regime of pressure dif-
ferences in the North Atlantic (NA). We conclude that the
pycnocline model is not able to reproduce the linear scal-
ing between its two central variables, pressure and volume
transport.

1. Introduction

The meridional overturning circulation in the Atlantic is
a central challenge to our understanding of global climate
dynamics. Gnanadesikan [1999] (G99 hereafter) presented
a model for the deep meridional circulation in terms of the
pycnocline depth (PD). This idealised model has been under
intense investigation as a possible paradigm for the merid-
ional overturning circulation [Gnanadesikan and Hallberg,
2000; Saenko and Weaver, 2002; Gnanadesikan et al., 2002].
Furthermore it has been used to investigate the qualitative
importance of diﬀerent physical feedbacks on the oceanic
circulation [Klinger et al., 2003, Gnanadesikan et al., 2003;
Kamenkovich and Sarachik, 2004]. A qualitative feature
of the deep meridional overturning circulation is the scal-
ing relation between the volume transport and the merid-
ional density diﬀerence in the Atlantic [Bryan 1987]. Pick-
ing up Bryan’s scaling arguments but assuming a constant
PD in the Atlantic Rahmstorf [1996] proposed a linear re-
lation which he demonstrated in the oceanic general cir-
culation model (GCM) MOM-2. Park [1999] and Scott et
al. [1999] derived the same scaling in a Stommel-type box
model. GCM simulations of the ocean suggest that this lin-
ear relation carries over from the density to the pressure
diﬀerence [Hughes and Weaver, 1994; Thorpe et al., 2001].
The linear scaling relation between pressure diﬀerence and
maximum overturning strength has since been demonstrated
to be a robust feature in oceanic GCM simulations (Griesel,
pers. comm., 2004). In sec. 4 we present simulations with
the coupled climate model CLIMBER-3α further supporting
these ﬁndings.

The G99 model contains four physical processes which
inﬂuence the PD in the ocean. The balance of the pres-
sure gradient in the North Atlantic and the frictional forces
within the boundary currents leads to an equation for the

The constant γn combines L(n)
y with β, ρ and C (the merid-
ional derivative of the Coriolis parameter f , the density and
a proportionality constant of order one). g is the gravity
constant. The quadratic dependence on D occurs due to
the vertical integration in order to obtain a volume trans-
port. In the SO the model includes the Drake passage eﬀect
through a wind-driven upwelling which does not explicitly
depend on the PD T (e)

where Kv and Au are the diapycnal diﬀusivity and the hori-

the underlying assumption of the model is that these four
process can be described using the same value D for the
PD throughout the Atlantic. Equ. (1) requires futhermore
that the vertical extension of the northward volume ﬂow is
also given by D. Accepting these assumptions, the conser-
vation of volume then results in the governing equation of

It can be shown that for all parameter settings the model
has at most one solution with non-negative PD. In sec. 2
we give this solution analytically in terms of the volume
transport Tn as a function of the pressure diﬀerence ∆p and
discuss, in sec. 3, its scaling with ∆p. In sec. 4 we compare
the results with simulations with the coupled climate model
CLIMBER-3α.

Note that despite the fact that the governing equ. (5) is cu-
bic in D, the model does have at most one physical solution
given by equ. (8). The model does therefore not bear the
possibility of multiple stable modes of the deep meridional
overturning circulation as suggested by simulations with cli-
mate models of diﬀerent complexity [Stommel, 1961; Man-
abe and Stouﬀer, 1988; Rahmstorf, 1995, 1996; Ganopolski
et.al., 2001; Prange et al., 2003]. This is to be expected given
that the model does not include a salt-advection feedback as
proposed by Stommel [1961]. Fig. 1 shows the solution for
diﬀerent diapycnal mixing coeﬃcients Kv. The results were
obtained using the numerical values given by G99. Note
that the solution (8) depends continuously on the diapycnal
mixing coeﬃcient Kv
γu. No change in the quality of
the solution (8) occurs in the absence of the low-latitudinal

In contrast to the behaviour for vanishing Kv, the elimina-
tion of the SO processes changes the quality of the solution
as can be seen from equ. (8) and will be discussed in the
next section.

3. Scaling of the Volume Transport Tn

Next, let us discuss the scaling of the volume transport
Tn with the meridional pressure diﬀerence ∆p. First, con-
sider the situation without the SO processes, i.e. T (e)
s =
T (gm)
= 0. The scaling can be obtained from the general
s
solution in equ. (8) with γe = γgm = 0. More illustrative
is the derivation from the original equations for the volume
transport (1) and (4). The fact that the northern down-
welling has to be balanced by the low-latitude upwelling
Tn = γnD

∆p = Tu = γu/D implies that

i.e. the PD decreases with increasing pressure diﬀerence in
the NA. Using this expression to replace D in the parame-
terisation of Tn in equ. (1) yields

In connection with equ. (2) we get the scaling T (noSO)

the pressure diﬀerence in the NA in the simulations. The
vertical diﬀusivity in coupled model was kept constant at
−1. Thus the simulations correspond to the
κv = 0.1 cm2s
dashed solution curve in ﬁg. 1. Simulations and concep-
tual model do neither agree quantitatively using the values
suggested by G99 nor is the qualitative behaviour of the
two main quantities (pressure and volume transport) repro-
duced in the conceptual model. These results are supported
by recent ﬁndings by Griesel (pers. comm., 2004) with an
oceanic GCM. Their work shows that the linear scaling be-
tween pressure and overturning strength is a robust feature.
It is independent of changes to various parameters including
the Gent and McWilliams diﬀusivity coeﬃcients. In order

to emphasize that fact that the linear scaling Tn
responds to constant D we plot in ﬁg. 3 the PD as deﬁned
in G99 for our simulations. In contrast to G99 in an OGCM
we ﬁnd in our coupled model no signiﬁcant variation of the
PD for varying pressure diﬀerence.

5. Conclusions

By giving an analytic expression for the meridional over-
turning strength Tn as a function of the meridional pres-
sure diﬀerence ∆p, we discuss the scaling of the two main
quantities of the conceptual model introduced by G99. The
model exhibits two scaling regimes which both correspond

s = const. in the wind-driven limit, i.e. for
Tn

e /(γn∆p). As expected no
small vertical diﬀusivity γu
≪
scaling between pressure diﬀerence and volume transport is
observed in this case.

In order to discuss the scaling behaviour in the presence
of both SO processes in the model, we plot the solutions
shown in ﬁg. 1 in double logarithmic scale in ﬁg. 2. For
small ∆p all solutions which include the SO processes have
slope one which corresponds to a linear scaling of the vol-
ume transport with the pressure diﬀerence. For comparison
the solution without the SO processes from equ. (11) has
been included as the solid curve in ﬁg. 2 showing the one-
half slope. This result can be understood from the general
solution in equation (8) which also sets the scale ∆ps for
which the linear relation holds. For ∆p

the solution (8) becomes

i.e. Tn is linear in the meridional pressure diﬀerence ∆p.
Using the numerical values given by G99, we obtain an es-
timate for the pressure scale ∆ps = 31.25 hP a which is
consistent with the scaling seen in ﬁg. 2. Simulations with
the oceanic general circulation model MOM-3 show a linear
scaling of Tn with ∆p for a variety of parameter settings,
including the case of zero diapycnal mixing (Griesel, (pers.
comm., 2004). The pressure scale in these simulations is of
the order of ∆ps

the above estimate.

The physical meaning of the scaling regime is seen when
. which
multiplying ∆ps with D which gives Tn
means that the scaling occurs only when the circulation is
completely dominated by the SO processes, i.e. when the
eddy-induced return ﬂow in the Southern Ocean is much
stronger than the downwelling in the NA. This situation
is not consistent with the underlying physical assumption of
the model of an interhemispheric meridional overturning cir-
culation and it does not describe the observed circulation in
the ocean. From equ. (6) and (12) we can see that in the lin-
ear scaling regime the pycnocline depth does not vary with
the pressure diﬀerence, in contrast to the situation without
SO processes (equ. (10)) where D decreases with ∆p. From
equ. (2) we see that for constant D the pressure diﬀerence
scales in the same way as the density diﬀerence ∆ρ

(1).

The linear relationship between the maximum overturn-
ing strength and the density diﬀerence ∆ρ which was ob-
served by Rahmstorf [1996] in a oceanic GCM is reﬂected
in the parameterization of the northern downwelling in
equ.
In the conceptual model, however, it does not
carry over to the pressure diﬀerence, as was shown in the
previous section. In order to check this scaling we carried
out simulations with the coupled climate model CLIMBER-
3α. The model contains an atmosphere and a sea-ice mod-
ule as well as the oceanic general circulation model MOM-
3. The eﬀect of baroclinic eddies was included through
a parameterization following Gent and McWilliams [1990]
−1. For a full de-

from the present day equilibrium simulation with a max-
imum overturning strength of 12 Sv, we apply a negative

to unphysical situations. Linear scaling occurs in a situa-
tion where the eddy-induced return ﬂow is much stronger
than the northern downwelling. This corresponds to a cir-
culation which is localized entirely in the SO and in which
all downward volume transport is due to the eddy-induced
return ﬂow. This situation is inconsistent with the physical
assumption of an interhemispheric overturning cell underly-
ing the model and the isopycnal nature of the return ﬂow.
The second scaling regime corresponds to a purely north-
ern cell where the upwelling takes place entirely in low
latitudes, described by an advection-diﬀusion balance.
In
this case the overturning is proportional to the square root
of the pressure as reported by Bryan [1987]. The scaling
was checked using the coupled climate model CLIMBER-
3α with a parameter setup comparable to the conceptual
model, i.e.
including eﬀects of baroclinic eddies following
Gent and McWilliams [1990] and a vertical diﬀusivity of
−1. The simulations exhibit a linear scaling
κh = 0.1cm2s
and therefore support previous studies [Hughes and Weaver,
1994; Rahmstorf, 1996; Thorpe et al., 2001] with comprehen-
sive climate models. The PD does not vary signiﬁcantly as
a function of the pressure diﬀerence in our simulations.

We conclude that the conceptual model of the PD can
not reproduce the scaling between its central variables, the
pressure and the volume transport. Besides possible crit-
icism regarding the speciﬁc parameterizations of the four
physical processes contained in the model, the assumption
of a universal D for all these processes seems questionable.

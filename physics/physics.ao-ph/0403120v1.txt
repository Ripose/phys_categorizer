Abstract Daily temperature anomaly records are an-
alyzed (61 for Australia, 18 for Hungary) by means of de-
trended ﬂuctuation analysis. Positive long range asymp-
totic correlations extending up to 5-10 years are detected
for each case. Contrary to earlier claims, the correlation
exponent is not universal for continental stations. Inter-
estingly, the dominant factor is geographic latitude over
Australia: the general tendency is a decrease of correla-
tion exponent with increasing distance from the equator.
This tendency is in a complete agreement with the re-
sults found by Tsonis et al. (1999) for 500-hPa height
anomalies in the northern hemisphere. The variance of
ﬂuctuations exhibits an opposite trend, the larger is the
distance from the equator, the larger the amplitude of
intrinsic ﬂuctuations. The presence of Tropospheric Bi-
ennial Oscillation is clearly identiﬁed for three stations
at the north-eastern edge of the Australian continent.

1 Introduction

Sophisticated detection studies demonstrate that the mean
global surface temperature has increased by ∼ 0.06◦C
per decade in the 20th Century and by 0.19◦C per decade
between 1978 and 1998 (Houghton et al., 2001). All pro-
jections of future change indicate that the warming is
likely to continue, and this conclusion holds regardless
of the computer model used or the emission scenario ap-
plied in the model (Zwiers, 2002). Besides an improving
reproduction of current mean atmospheric state, conﬁ-
dence in the simulation and prediction skills of global
climate models requires the reproduction of long-time
correlation properties revealed by measurements. A re-
cent test by Govindan et al. (2002) of seven state-of-
the-art global models failed to reproduce the scaling be-
havior of six long temperature records by underestimat-

ing the long range persistence of the atmosphere. Sim-
ilar discrepancies were detected already by Syroka and
Toumi (2001a, 2001b). Quite the contrary, Fraedrich and
Blender (2003) demonstrated that long range correla-
tions can be reproduced by a numerical model if the cou-
pling with ocean is represented properly (although with
ﬁxed composition of greenhouse gases). In any case, di-
rect comparison of local observations with the rather low
resolution general circulation models might have many
pitfalls (Pielke et al., 2002), therefore an extended analy-
sis of measured asymptotic correlations is a prerequisite.
Various methods are used to characterize quantita-
tively the ﬂuctuations and correlations of high frequency
meteorological data. Power density spectra (Marple 1987;
Percival and Walden 1993) have been routinely com-
puted for decades. Pelletier (1997) determined the tem-
perature spectra for hundreds of stations and ice core
records and identiﬁed power-law behavior for continental
and maritime locations. Koscielny-Bunde et al. (1998)
reported to observe a near universal exponent value in
the ﬂuctuations of daily temperatures, however Weber
and Talkner (2001) found diﬀerences depending on the
altitude of the meteorological station. Probably the largest
related study up to now is presented by Eichner et al. (2003)
on temperature records of 95 stations all over the globe.
They obtained correlation exponent values in the range
0.55-0.9 centered strongly at around 0.65 over conti-
nents, but systematically higher values for islands. The
last observation is supported by Monetti et al. (2003),
where they detected much stronger persistence for sea
surface temperature than values for air over ground.
Tsonis et al. (1999) demonstrated scale invariance in
the variability of 500-hPa height anomalies and found
a general tendency for the correlation exponent to de-
crease with increasing latitude. In general, scaling can
be identiﬁed asymptotically from the longest available
records only, shorter-time correlations are almost fully
explained by using ﬁrst or second order linear autore-
gressive models (von Storch and Zwiers 1999; Kir´aly and
J´anosi 2002).

Andrea Kir´aly, Imre M. J´anosi

In this work we exploit the method of detrended ﬂuc-
tuation analysis (DFA) which has proven useful in re-
vealing the extent of long range correlations in diverse
time series (Peng et al. 1994, 1995). Talkner and Weber
(2000), and Heneghan and McDarby (2000) pointed out
that DFA and traditional power spectra provide equiv-
alent characterizations of correlated stochastic signals,
with the essential diﬀerence that DFA can eﬀectively ﬁl-
ter out slow trends. The situation is similar to the con-
nection of power spectra and autocorrelation functions
manifested by the Wiener-Khintchin theorem: the infor-
mation content is mathematically the same, but in many
cases spectral density functions are more sensitive and
better exploratory tools for real data (von Storch and
Zwiers 1999).

Our analysis is based on a high-quality daily temper-
ature data set for Australia (Torok and Nicholls 1996;
Trewin and Trevitt 1996). The same collection was uti-
lized in many studies to reveal an increased wheat yield
due to recent climate trends (Nicholls 1997), changing
maximum and minimum temperature trends for the globe
(Easterling et al. 1997), Australian land surface temper-
ature variability (Jones 1999), trends in extreme daily
rainfall and temperature in Southeast Asia (Manton et
al. 2001), the impact of land cover change on the Aus-
tralian near-surface climate (Narisma and Pitman 2003),
etc. Data for 61 (out from 107) stations were selected ac-
cording to the quality of their climate record, in terms
of site standards, homogeneity and completeness of the
series, and to provide the best possible spatial coverage
(48 for the continent, 13 for islands). The average time
span of the records was 45 years with a minimum of 22
and a maximum of 120 years. We evaluated also histor-
ical records of daily mean temperatures measured at 18
weather-stations in Hungary from 1951 until 1989. Am-
plitude distributions, power spectra and autocorrelation
functions were analyzed earlier essentially for the same
data set by J´anosi and Vattay (1992), asymptotic scaling
and stochastic modeling have been described by Kir´aly
and J´anosi (2002).

Since the DFA method is relatively new, we provide
its concise exposition in Section 2. Section 3 gives the
details of our results, Section 4 is devoted to a short
discussion of the relevance and consequences of the ﬁnd-
ings.

2 Detrended ﬂuctuation analysis

The most important advantage of DFA over conventional
methods (e.g., autocorrelation-, spectral- and Hurst-ana-
lysis) is that it permits the detection of intrinsic self-
similarity embedded in a seemingly nonstationary time
series. Following the work of Peng et al. (1994, 1995),
several theoretical studies elucidated the power and limi-
tations of ﬁltering out various trends from synthetic data
series (Heneghan and McDarby 2000; Talkner and We-

ber 2000; Hu et al. 2001; Kantelhardt et al. 2001; Chen
et al. 2002).

We consider a ﬂuctuating time series xi, (i = 1, ..., N )
sampled at equidistant times i∆t. We assume that xi are
increments of a random walk process around the aver-
age hxi = N −1
N
i=1 xi = 0, thus the “trajectory” or
“proﬁle” of the signal is given by integration as

P

yj =

xi .

We divide the proﬁle into nonoverlapping segments of
equal length n indexed by k = 1, ..., [N/n]. In each seg-
ment, the local trend is ﬁtted by a polynomial f (p)
k (j)
of order-p [see Fig. 1(a)], and the proﬁle is detrended by
subtracting this local ﬁt: z(p)
k (j), j = 1, ..., N .
A possible measure of ﬂuctuations can be given by the
root mean square

j = yj −f (p)

for a given segment length n. A power-law relationship
between Fp(n) and n indicates scaling with an exponent
δ (DFAp exponent):

Fp(n) ∼ nδ .

Notice that such a process has a power-law autocorrela-
tion function

C(τ ) = hxj xj+τ i ∼ τ

−α ,

where 0 < α < 1, and the relationship between the corre-
lation exponents is (Koscielny-Bunde et al. 1998; Talkner
and Weber 2000)

α = 2(1 − δ) .

Consequently, long-memory (persistent) processes are char-
acterized by a DFA exponent δ > 0.5, uncorrelated time
series (e.g., pure random walk) obey δ = 0.5, antipersis-
tent signals exhibiting negative long range correlations
have δ < 0.5. (Here the terms “persistent” and “antiper-
sistent” are used in the sense that an increasing trend
in the past implies an increasing or decreasing trend in
the future, thus it slightly diﬀers from “persistence” in
climatology deﬁned as the continuance of a speciﬁc pat-
tern.)

Fig. 1(b) shows typical results for a particular sta-
tion (Gunnedah). As a ﬁrst step of the analysis, the an-
nual cycle is removed from the raw data Ti (daily mean
temperatures) by computing the temperature anomaly
series

xi = Ti − hTiid ,

where hid denotes the long-time average value for the
given calendar day. The curves in Fig. 1(b) represent
the results for DFA1, DFA2 and DFA3 evaluation, where

local trends were removed by linear, second-, and third-
order polynomials. The low noise level is due to the stan-
dard “sliding window” technique, where local trend re-
moval and variance computation for a given time win-
dow n were performed at each possible starting value
i = 1, ..., N − n. The shapes are practically the same in-
dicating that there is no signiﬁcant trend in the temper-
ature anomaly series (DFAp would ﬁlter out an overall
polynomial trend of order p − 1 resulting in changing
asymptotic slopes). Note that this observation does not
contradict recent studies on global warming for the same
geographic area, because relatively weak trends are eas-
ily masked by the variability of daily average temper-
atures, thus careful statistical analyses of extremes are
proven more convincing (Easterling et al. 1997; Man-
ton et al. 2001; Frich et al. 2002). The gradual down-
ward shift (decreased overall variance for a given seg-
ment length n) is a simple consequence of that local
trends are better approximated by polynomials of higher
order [c.f. Fig. 1(a)]. For short times (n < 20 day), the
curves exhibit a gradually decreasing slope to a well de-
ﬁned asymptotic value δ = 0.75 ± 0.01 for the particular
case, the statistics breaks down for very large segment
lengths (n > 2000 day ≈ one ﬁfths of the total length).
Systematic analyses by Hu et al. (2001), Kantelhardt
et al. (2001) and Chen et al. (2002) with various syn-
thetic time series revealed many useful details on the
eﬃciency of the method. One of their main ﬁndings is
that DFA results for signals with diﬀerent correlation
properties and background trends can be fully explained
by the assumption of variance superposition. This is es-
sential because the correlation exponent is almost never
constant for any real data, crossover(s) can usually arise
from a change in the correlation properties at diﬀerent
time scales or as a consequence of trends. Other types of
nonstationarities are missing segments in records (very
common), contamination with random spikes, or signals
with diﬀerent local behavior (diﬀerent variance or local
correlations). From our point of view, the most impor-
tant cases are the following (Hu et al. 2001; Kantelhardt
et al. 2001; Chen et al. 2002):

1. Long range correlated process with additive random
noise. The typical DFA curve has a crossover from a
slope δ = 0.5 (noise dominated part) to a diﬀerent
asymptotic value. The crossover time depends pri-
marily on the variance of the random noise (large
amplitude - later crossover) and on the correlation
exponent of the underlying process (large exponent -
earlier crossover).

2. Noise with sinusoidal trend. A pure sinusoidal signal
has a DFAp curve of initial slope δ = p + 1 with a
crossover to δ = 0. (Obviously, the variance is limited
by the total amplitude in time windows larger than
the half period of the harmonic signal.) Together with
noise, the resulting DFAp curve is a superposition of
both ingredients.

3. Signals with segments removed. Surprisingly, scaling
of correlated data series (δ > 0.5) is not aﬀected
by randomly cutting out segments and stitching to-
gether the remaining parts, even when 50% of the
points are removed (Chen et al. 2002). Neverthe-
less the applicability of this result for temperature
records with long missing segments is limited, be-
cause the removal of the annual cycle can be prob-
lematic.

4. Signals with diﬀerent local correlations. In general,
when random parts of a correlated data series is re-
placed by segments from another series of diﬀerent
correlation exponent, the behavior is dominated by
the segments exhibiting higher positive correlations
(Chen et al. 2002). However, there is a wide transi-
tion regime with a nontrivial exponent, thus a “true”
asymptotic behavior could be observed at very long
time series only, especially when the diﬀerence be-
tween the exponents is small. We will return to the
relevance of this point in Section 4 (Discussion).

Finally, we emphasize that we observed weak overall
trends in the longest temperature anomaly series (Syd-
ney, Melbourne, Adelaide) which might be attributed
to urbanization or global warming, but this question is
beyond the scope of the present work. Even for these
cases, DFA2 or higher order exponents could not be dis-
tinguished from DFA1 values within the ﬁtting error.

3 Results

We analyzed 61 daily maximum, minimum and mean
temperature series for Australian stations, and 18 daily
mean temperature records for Hungary. We found asymp-
totic long range correlations in the range 30-1800 days
for each case, the ﬁtting regime of power-law behavior
extends up to 10 years for the longest records. In strong
contrast to earlier claims on a universal exponent value
(Koscielny-Bunde et al. 1998; Govindan et al. 2002), we
found pronounced station dependence.

3.1 Correlation exponent

Figure 2 illustrates how the value of correlation exponent
δ is connected with the geographic location of the station
over Australia. Here DFA analysis was performed for 48
daily mean temperature anomaly series, the behavior of
daily minima and maxima is practically the same. Two
tendencies can be resolved in Fig. 2. Firstly, the general
trend is a decrease of exponents with decreasing lati-
tude. Indeed, the contours of the ﬁtted surface are al-
most parallel with the lines of latitude. This tendency is
in complete agreement found by Tsonis et. al. (1999) for
500-hPa height anomalies in the northern hemisphere,
which indicates that the key factor is the distance from
the equator. Secondly, there is a hump over the south-
eastern part of the continent which correlates well with

4

the location of the highest mountain range (Australian
Alps). We do not want to overemphasize this observa-
tion, nevertheless Weber and Talkner (2001) found also
higher exponent values for mountain weather stations.

The decreasing tendency over the Australian conti-
nent is clear also in Fig. 3, where the same exponent δ
is plotted as a function of latitude for every analyzed
stations. Error bars are obtained from ﬁts to diﬀerent
segments for the scaling regime of DFA curves. A com-
parison with Hungarian data (stars in Fig. 3) indicate
another aspect of the the lack of universality: geographic
latitude is not a dominant factor over the Carpathian
Basin. Note that a full symmetry of the northern and
southern hemispheres is not expected, also the diﬀer-
ences of climates should be reﬂected in diﬀering corre-
lation properties. As for the islands, Weber and Talkner
(2001), and Monetti et. al. (2003) already reported on
systematically higher level of correlations for maritime
stations and sea surface temperatures, which is in agree-
ment with our results (see Fig. 3). It is interesting that
the trend for islands is also decreasing upto 50◦S. The
number of cases below this latitude is not enough to
conclude whether the trend is reversed there, or what
we see is just localized anomaly. These four stations (in
latitudinal order: Macquarie Island, Casey, Mawson, and
Davis) belong essentially to Antarctic climate.

It is remarkable that our main result (decreasing ex-
ponents with increasing distance from the equator) is
not visible on the map given by Fraedrich and Blender
(2003), which might be a consequence of their much
lower spatial resolution over Australia.

In order to reveal another possible determining fac-
tors, we show in Fig. 4 scatter plots for the exponent
value δ and diﬀerent geographic parameters. Hungarian
data in Fig. 4a (stars) indicate that longitude is a dom-
inating factor over this region, unfortunately the nar-
row spatial coverage restricts an unambiguous conclu-
sion. This behavior is reﬂected also in Fig. 4c, but this is
an obvious consequence of geographic locations: what-
ever is the reference point (Mediterranean Sea or At-
lantic Ocean), the distance from the shore is increasing
as the longitude increases.

As for Australia, Fig. 4a can be explained by accept-
ing that latitude is the determining factor, and there is
no correlation with longitude. In this case we expect a
distribution reﬂecting somehow the shape of the conti-
nent. Indeed, the higher density of stations at the south-
west corner is seemed to be projected in Fig. 4a. Cumu-
lated exponent values show weak correlation with the
elevation, see Fig. 4b. Note that this does not contra-
dict to the interpretation we gave for the ridge in Fig. 2,
because this scatter plot smears diﬀerences in longitude
and latitude of stations. As for the distance from the
oceans (Fig. 4c), the dependence is week again. High ex-
ponent values can be associated with islands, but there
is no signiﬁcant drop as we move away from the shore.
This does not mean that the distance from large water

masses can not contribute to the degree of correlation,
but the apparent eﬀect is weak over Australia.

Fig. 4d shows the scatter plot for δ and the DFA vari-
ance at a ﬁxed temporal window size, but let us return
to this point after describing the general properties of
variance itself, in the next Subsection.

3.2 Variance

In order to characterize the average variance of ﬂuctua-
tions, we plotted F1(n = 108) (see Eq. 2) for daily mean
temperature anomalies in Fig. 5 as a function of geo-
graphic location. Daily minima and maxima show the
same behavior (but not necessarily the same numeri-
cal value), again. The particular time lag might seem
to be somewhat arbitrary, however any other choice in
the range 100 < n < 500 resulted in the same statistics,
apart from numerical values. Too large time lags are not
suitable, because the DFA curves for diﬀerent stations
have diﬀerent slopes, and crossing confounds the rela-
tionship between stations. The general trend for vari-
ance over the continent is not surprising: the proximity
of ocean damps temperature ﬂuctuations, which is a well
known and well documented fact.

Figure 6 shows the variance statistics for every sta-
tions as a function of geographic latitude. There is a
trend of increasing variance with increasing distance from
the equator, especially for the islands. This tendency can
be revealed also by marking continental stations on the
shore (solid circles with crosses in Fig. 6), however the
dispersion is rather large. Variances far from the oceans
are systematically increased both for Australia and Hun-
gary (Fig. 6).

The correlation plot between average variance and
DFA exponents is shown in Fig. 4d. Based on Fig. 3a and
Fig. 6, we expect that stations far away from the equator
obey a relatively low exponent value but large variance,
this negative correlation is clearly visible in Fig. 4d. The
scatter for continental stations is pretty large, thus one-
to-one coupling remains hidden (if it exists at all) by
other modifying factors, such as the distance from ocean
or elevation.

3.3 Detection of Tropospheric Biennial Oscillation

In a few cases, DFA curves exhibited characteristic kinks
shown in Fig. 7(a), which became more pronounced at
higher order local detrending. This behavior is consistent
with the presence of a periodic sinusoidal background
trend (Hu et al. 2001). Unfortunately, there is no way
to decompose such an underlying component, especially
because it is far from being pure harmonic indicated by
the shift of breakpoints [see Fig. 7(a)].

The existence of a slow, smeared oscillation was ac-
tually clear for three stations, namely Cairns (16.88◦S,

145.27◦E), Thursday Island (10.58◦S, 142.21◦E), and Wil-
lis Island (16.30◦S, 149.98◦E); a further time series (Dar-
win, 12.42◦S, 130.88◦E) indicated a weak signal of sim-
ilar behavior. For these cases, even the standard auto-
correlation analysis [Fig. 7(b)] revealed statistically sig-
niﬁcant periodicity of 1.9 ± 0.2 year (note that this is
an average considering also higher harmonics). The very
stations are located at the north-eastern edge of the
continent (Fig. 3), and they exhibit the lowest intrinsic
variance, see Fig. 5. [Actually, the lowermost variance
is found at Cocos (Keeling) Island (12.07◦S, 96.83◦E),
c.f. Fig. 6, but it is situated far to the west in the In-
dian Ocean.) No other stations have shown statistically
signiﬁcant periodic components.

The location of these places suggests that the ob-
served periodic trend might be connected with the well-
known El-Ni˜no Southern Oscillation (ENSO), that is
the quasi-periodic disruption of the Walker circulation
forced by a pressure gradient over the Paciﬁc. The changes
in pressure distribution are measured by the Southern
Oscillation Index (SOI), which is far from being regu-
lar with a period of 2-7 years (Ropelewski and Jones
1987; Allan et. al. 1991). A direct comparison of the au-
tocorrelation functions for the daily mean temperature
anomalies at Willis Island [Fig. 7(b)] and for the SOI
signal [Fig. 7(c)] shows immediately that the two oscil-
lations are not strongly coupled.

Biennial signals in rainfall, sea-level pressure, sea-
surface temperature and other climate elements in the
tropical Indian and western Paciﬁc regions have been
known and studied for years (e.g.,Trenberth 1975; Meehl
1987; 1997). The phenomenon is termed as Tropospheric
Biennial Oscillation (TBO). This TBO has an irregular
period of 2-3 years and shows eastward movement. Sev-
eral theories and hypotheses have been proposed, how-
ever the exact mechanism is not clearly known. A strong
biennial component is seen in the ENSO phenomena
(Ropelewski et. al. 1992) and it is accepted to be an
integral part of the Asia-Paciﬁc climate. Since the slow
oscillation observed for the stations above has a charac-
teristic period of two years [see Fig. 7(b)], we can con-
sider it as a ﬁngerprint of TBO. As far as we know,
no other daily surface data series of similar length have
shown such markedly the presence of two-year oscilla-
tion.

(iii) There is a general tendency of decreasing exponent
value with increasing distance from the equator over
Australia.

(iv) The variance of ﬂuctuations has an opposite trend:
the larger the distance from the equator, the larger
the intrinsic variance.

Let us comment shortly points (ii) and (iii). As for
the lack of universality, (ii), an opposite conclusion could
be drawn from DFA analysis of a few time series only
(Koscielny-Bunde et al. 1998; Govindan et al. 2002).
Similar tests by Weber and Talkner (2001), Monetti et.
al. (2002), Fraedrich and Blender (2003), and especially
Eichner et al. (2003) do indicate signiﬁcant diﬀerences
as a function of climatic parameters of the stations. Dif-
ferent exponent values for diﬀerent places do not exclude
the existence of a universal mechanism behind the long
memory eﬀects, such as coupling with the oceans. Never-
theless any speculation on such a mechanism should be
preceded by further analyses of asymptotic correlations
with the highest possible spatial resolution.

The decreasing tendency of correlation exponents over
Australia is in complete agreement with the results by
Tsonis et. al. (1999) for 500-hPa height anomalies in the
northern hemisphere. Their ﬂuctuation analysis is es-
sentially identical with a DFA1 method, even exponent
values can be compared. They attribute a decreasing de-
gree of correlations to an increasingly baroclinic nature
of the dynamics as one progresses from the subtropics
through the midlatitudes. More baroclinicity results in
more power to processes of small spatial and temporal
scales. Our results support this picture in the following
way. Whatever is the source of a decreased correlation
exponent at higher latitudes, it can not be decomposed
to a core dynamics and an additive random noise. This
is because the DFA method very eﬀectively identiﬁes
such a process. Tuning of the exponent value is possible,
e.g., by replacing random parts of a correlated signal
with segments from another series of diﬀerent correla-
tion properties (see Section 1). In this respect, a dy-
namics of increased baroclinicity means that an under-
lying correlated process can be more often interrupted by
short-memory, small scale processes yielding a decreased
eﬀective correlation exponent.

4 Discussion

Our main ﬁndings can be summarized as follows.

(i) Daily temperature values have signiﬁcant positive
long range correlations extending for several years.
There is no sign of breakdown of scaling behavior
even for the longest time series.

(ii) The “degree” of correlations, i.e., the value of corre-
lation exponent is not universal, it depends on the
geographic location.

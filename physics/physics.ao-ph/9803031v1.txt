Summary

The maximum measured electric fields in thunderclouds are an order of magnitude less
than the fields required for electric breakdown of the air. One explanation for lightning
initiation in these low fields is that electric breakdown first occurs at the surfaces of
raindrops where the ambient field is enhanced very locally due to the drop geometry . Lab-
oratory experiments [Crabb & Latham, 1974] indicate that colliding raindrops which coalesce
to form elongated water filaments can produce positive corona in ambient fields close to
those measured in thunderclouds. We calculate the E-field distribution around a simulated
coalesced drop pair and use a numerical model to study the positive corona mechanisms in
detail. Our results give good agreement with the laboratory observations. At the altitudes
(and thus low pressures) at which lightning initiation is observed, our results show that
positive corona can occur at observed in-cloud E-fields.

1.

Introduction

Lightning initiation in thunderclouds is poorly understood. An order of magnitude
discrepancy exists between the maximum measured electric ﬁelds (E-ﬁelds) in clouds
(Emax) and the E-ﬁelds required for dielectric breakdown of air. Emax ∼ 100 - 400 kV/m
[Marshall et al, 1995, Winn et al, 1974]. Ebreakdown ∼ 2700 kV/m at surface pressure; at
the lower pressures (∼ 500 mb) at which most lightning is observed to initiate, Ebreakdown
is reduced to ∼ 1400 kV/m - still far greater than Emax.

One of several explanations put forward to explain this discrepancy is the enhance-
ment of the electric ﬁeld near the surfaces of hydrometeors (water or ice particles) in
clouds. A set of laboratory experiments by Crabb & Latham (hereafter CL) showed that
colliding raindrops may provide the starting point for lightning initiation. CL obtained
very promising results in a set of experiments in which they measured the E-ﬁelds re-
quired to initiate a discharge from the surface of ﬁlamentary, temporarily coalesced drops
created when two water drops collided. They observed pulsed, intermittent discharges in
a localized region near surface of the drop and found that the E-ﬁelds required lay within
the range of observed thunderstorm E-ﬁelds.

We extended models of the positive discharge process developed by [Dawson & Winn, 1965,

Gallimberti, 1979, Bondiou & Gallimberti, 1994, Abdel-Salam et al, 1976] in order to study
the discharge processes occurring from hydrometeors. CL’s laboratory conditions were
used to initialize the model and their results were used to validate it. With our model
we were able to vary both the microphysical and environmental conditions and inves-
tigate a range of conditions applicable to those found in thunderclouds. In particular,
we investigated continuous discharges from the drop surface and we studied the pressure
dependence of discharge initiation E-ﬁelds.

We begin with a brief description of Crabb & Latham’s experimental procedures and
results, followed by a discussion of the discharge model used to make the calculations.
Finally we discuss our model results - showing the E-ﬁeld required to initiate various
discharge types as a function of the coalesced drop properties and air pressure.

Figure 1 (a) shows a schematic of the CL experiment . Their chamber, held at surface
pressure, had a positive, high voltage upper plate and a grounded lower plate separated
by 50mm. Voltages of up to 30 kV could be applied - corresponding to a maximum
uniform E-ﬁeld of 600 kV/m within the chamber. Large water drops (R=2.7mm) were
dropped into the chamber and collided with small drops (r=0.65mm) which were blown
upwards, simulating drops moving in updrafts in thunderclouds. A variety of coalesced
drop shapes were observed, depending on the nature of the collision. CL described three
basic collision modes: head-on, glancing and intermediate. Glancing and intermediate
collisions produced a coalesced drop with a long ﬁlament extending from the large drop
- see Fig 1 (b). Head-on collisions resulted in a ﬂattening of the large drop and did not
produce these long ﬁlaments. The drops remained in the coalesced state for ∼ 1 ms.

In CL’s setup, a negative charge was induced on the upper surface of the drop while
the lower end had a positive induced charge. In the thundercloud setting these drops
would be located above the negative charge center of the cloud. CL recorded the size and
shape of the coalesced drops as well as the applied E-ﬁelds required to initiate discharges
for a large number of coalesced drops. They observed discharges from both ends of the
drop but focussed on the positive pulses occurring at the lower surface of the drop. This
surface was observed to remain intact. In contrast surface disruption was observed at the
upper, negative surface of the drop.

CL observed that positive burst pulses occured for values of E between 250 and 500

kV/m, depending on the length of the coalesced drop.

3. Model Description

We describe three basic discharge processes that can occur at the surfaces of drops

in the presence of strong E-ﬁelds.

CORONA EMISSION FROM HYDROMETEORS

3

The ﬁrst process, surface disruption discharge, occurs when the electrostatic repul-
sive force on a drop in a strong E-ﬁeld exceeds the surface tension. This results in breakup
of the drop surface, and an associated discharge. [Dawson, 1969] observed the surface E-
ﬁeld, Edisruption, required to initiate this form of discharge as a function of drop size.
Edisruption is independent of pressure.

The remaining processes are referred to as ’pure’ corona processes because the dis-
charge initiates without the occurrence of drop surface disruption. These processes are:

• burst pulse discharges, which are intermittent, and
• continuous streamers, which are capable of propagating continuously.

We discuss each in detail below. All of these processes result in deposition of charge
on the drop: either positive or negative charge depending on the sign of Eexternal. We
focussed only on positive corona: it is simpler to model, has a lower initiation threshold
and was studied more extensively by CL than negative corona.

Figure 2. Schematic of positive discharge formation near the surface of a drop. Free electrons are
accelerated by the E-ﬁeld and undergo collisions with air molecules. The ionization of molecules within
the ionization zone leads to an exponential growth of electrons (avalanche) and the formation of a
spherical streamer head.

Following [Dawson & Winn, 1965, Gallimberti, 1979, Bondiou & Gallimberti, 1994]

we model the positive discharge as a series of electron avalanches.

Consider the electric ﬁeld near the surface of a drop which is situated in an external
electric ﬁeld, Eexternal. (See Fig 2.) The total electric ﬁeld is a function of the distance,
r, from the drop surface. Initially, the total electric ﬁeld at r is

E(r) = Eg(r) = Eexternal + Edrop(r)

(1)

4

V. SCHROEDER et al.

where Edrop is the contribution due to charge induced on the drop. Eg(r) is called the
geometric ﬁeld.

In the presence of E free electrons are accelerated and undergo collisions with air

molecules. At some radial distance from the drop E is such that:

α(E/p) = η(E/p)

(2)

where α [m−1] and η [m−1] are the ionization and attachment coeﬃcient for electrons
in air, respectively and p is the total air pressure. The surface deﬁned by eqn (2) is the
ionization zone boundary - inside this boundary α > η and there is a net growth of free
electrons. At surface pressure the ionization zone boundary is the surface along which
E = 2700 kV/m. Figure 3 shows α and η as functions of E/p [Geballe, 1953, Loeb, 1965,
Badaloni, 1972, Ibrahim & Singer, 1982].

Following [Dawson & Winn, 1965, Griﬃths & Phelps, 1976, Gallimberti, 1979] we
replace the three-dimensional problem by a one-dimensional one in which all avalanches
occur along the z-axis. The point zi marks the intersection of the ionization boundary
with the z-axis. When a free electron, starting at zi, is accelerated by E towards the
drop, the number of electrons grows exponentially as z decreases. This is referred to as
the primary electron avalanche. Due to the exponential nature of the growth, most of
the ionizing collisions occur near the surface of the drop. The free electrons are then
absorbed by the drop, leaving behind a concentration of positive ions, modeled as a
sphere [Dawson & Winn, 1965, Gallimberti, 1979], and referred to as the streamer head.
The number of positive ions formed by the primary avalanche traveling from the

ionization zone boundary, zi, to the drop surface, zo, is given by:

N1 = exp[

(α(z)) − η(z))dz]

The radius of the streamer head is approximately:

Rs = [6

(D(z)/v(z)dz)]1/2

o

Z

zi

where D and v are the electron diﬀusivity and drift velocity, respectively. D and v are
functions of the ratio (E/p) and thus depend on z [Healey & Reed,1941, Ibrahim & Singer, 1982].
Rs ≈ 30µm at surface pressure for most of the calculations reported here.

The total electric ﬁeld at z is now given by:

E(z) = Eg(z) +

eN1
4πǫ0(z − Rs)2

where the second term, Ec, is the E-ﬁeld due to the spherical charge concentration of the
streamer head.

In addition to ionization, collisions between the free electrons and air molecules also
result in the excitation of the molecules, which then emit photons on decay. A certain
fraction of these photons in turn have suﬃcient energy to ionize molecules that they
encounter, creating photoelectrons. These photoelectrons then start a series of secondary
avalanches which converge on the drop from all directions.

The number of photoelectrons created per m at a radial distance, l, from the drop

surface is given by:

P (l) = f1N1 · exp[−µl] · f2 · G

Initiation Conditions
A burst pulse discharge is initiated if the number of photoelectrons created along
the ionization zone boundary during the growth of the primary avalanche is equivalent
to the number of photoelectrons that started the primary avalanche (commonly taken as
1) [Abdel-Salam et al, 1976].

We consider photoelectron production in a region of depth (1/µ) along the ionization

zone boundary and write the above condition as follows:

(7)

(8)

P (zi)
µ(zi)

= 1

This type of discharge is intermittent because the number of positive ions, N1, in the
primary streamer head is too small to attract the following avalanches to its surface.
Instead, the successor avalanches are directed to the drop - allowing the discharge to
“spread” over the drop surface.

The fulﬁllment of eqn (8) is strongly inﬂuenced by the relationship between the
mean free photon path (1/µ) in air and the location of zi. For drops with small radii, zi
is closer to the drop surface than for those with larger radii. Thus for small drops the
number of photons likely to reach the ionization zone boundary is increased. The chances
of a photoelectron being produced then increases and it is easier to initiate a burst pulse
discharge under these conditions.

eN1

A more stringent initiation condition exists for continuous streamers. In this case
the number of positive ions in the primary streamer head must be large enough to attract
the secondary avalanches to the streamer head surface. This is achieved when the radial
4πǫ0(z−Rs)2 ∼ Eg [Abdel-Salam et al, 1976]. In
E-ﬁeld around the streamer head, Ec =
addition:
(a) N2, the number of positive ions in the streamer head that results from the secondary
avalanches, must equal N1, the number of positive ions created by the primary avalanche,
and
(b) the radius of the secondary streamer head must equal Rs, the radius of the primary
streamer head.
These conditions ensure that the initial streamer head charge density is reproduced in
the second streamer head. Continued reproduction of the streamer head in subsequent
steps results in propagation of the positive streamer away from the drop surface. For all
the geometric conditions considered in this paper, the initiation of continuous streamers
requires a larger external E-ﬁeld than for burst pulse discharge initiation.

CORONA EMISSION FROM HYDROMETEORS

The minimum value of Eexternal necessary to initiate a discharge at pressure p
is referred to as Einitiation(p) and depends on the type of discharge (burst pulse or
continuous streamer).

Our results were obtained using the following procedure:

(b) Model Procedure

• Deﬁne the drop shape and permittivity, ǫ. The idealized shape used is shown in Fig 4.

Set the air pressure, p.

• Apply Eexternal to the drop.
• Calculate the E-ﬁeld distribution around the drop using a ﬁnite element method based

solving routine [Quickﬁeld].

• Compare the E-ﬁeld at the drop’s negative surface to the known surface disruption

ﬁeld threshold, Edisruption [Dawson, 1969].
If E(surf ace) > Edisruption then add varying amounts of positive charge, Qdrop, to the
drop.

• Recalculate the E-ﬁeld distribution [Quickﬁeld].
• Find the ionization zone boundary, zi.
• Compute N1 and R1 from eqns (3) and (4) respectively.
• Compute P (l) at zi from eqn (6).

For P (zi)

µ(zi) = 1, Eexternal = Einitiation(p) for burst pulse discharges.

• Compute N2 and R2 from eqns (7) and (4) respectively.

If Ec ∼ Eg, N2 = N1 and R2 = R1, then Eexternal = Eintiation(p) for continuous stream-
ers.

4. Results

(a) Surface disruption

For Eexternal ≥ 200 kV/m the calculated E-ﬁeld at the surface of the upper, negative
end of the drop was ≥ 8500 kV/m, the value of Edisruption at p=1000mb for a water drop
of radius r =0.65mm [Dawson, 1969]. This is consistent with CL’s observations that the
upper surface disrupted at these E-ﬁeld strengths. The resulting negative discharge then
deposited positive charge on the drop.

(b) Einitiation vs Qdrop

Fig 5 shows the Einitiation values for positive burst pulse discharges from the lower
positive end of the drop as a function of the charge, Qdrop, deposited on the drop by the
negative discharge from the upper end. The drop length is held ﬁxed at L=20mm.

drop length is held ﬁxed at L=20mm.

Einitiation decreases rapidly once Qdrop exceeds 10−10 C. The Rayleigh stability
criterion [Rayleigh, 1882, Taylor, 1964] gives QRL, the maximum charge that a sphere of
liquid can hold before the electrostatic repulsive force overcomes the surface tension. In
SI units it is given by:

Q2

RL = 64 π2 ǫo · r3 σ

(9)

where r is the sphere radius and σ is the surface tension.

For our drop dimensions QRL ≈ 4 × 10−9 C. Since CL did not observe disruption
of the lower surface of the drop, we limited our calculations to Qdrop < QRL. For larger
allowed values of Qdrop, close to the Rayleigh limit QRL, the values of Einitiation become
comparable to CL’s experimental values and to those observed in thunderclouds.

In addition to the burst pulse discharges we also calculated the ﬁelds required to
initiate continuous streamers. For Qdrop just below the Rayleigh limit, Einitiation ≈ 400
kV/m for continuous streamers, approximately 50% greater than that required for burst
pulse discharges.

(c) Einitiation vs drop length, L

We now held the charge density, ρ, on the drop ﬁxed at 0.035 C/m3 and varied the
drop length, L. The circles in Fig 6 represent CL’s measured values. We found that our
modeled values of Einitiation for the burst pulse discharges (△) decreased with increasing
L, consistent with the trend that CL observed.

The agreement between the calculated results and observation is promising and oﬀers
validation of our model processes. The scatter in CL’s results is most likely due to either
the diﬀerences in the shape of the lower end of the coalesced drops or the amount of
charge that is deposited by the negative discharge. We found higher Einitiation values for
a coalesced drop with a spherically shaped lower end, while lower Einitiation values were
recorded for more pointed lower ends. Our idealized shape with ρ=0.035 C/m3, however,
provided good agreement with CL’s average values for Einitiation.

The same calculations were carried out for continuous streamers and the results are
shown in Fig 7. Einitiation decreased with L in much the same way as for burst pulses.
The Einitiation values for the continuous streamers were, however, ∼ 50% larger than
those required for burst pulses.

Figure 8 shows the two competing processes that determine the dependence of
Einitiation on L for continuous streamers. On the one hand, for a given ambient E-
ﬁeld, the surface ﬁeld at the tip of the ﬁlament increases with increasing L, which lowers
Einitiation. In opposition to this, as L increases Eg(z) decreases more rapidly with z,

creases Einitiation. Fig 7 shows that the former process dominates; i.e. that the increased
average ﬁeld within the ionization zone compensates for the electron’s shortened path -
leading to a lowering of Einitiation as the ﬁlament length is increased. As Fig 7 indicates,
dEinitiation/dL decreases as L increases and the eﬀect of increased length becomes less

(d) The pressure eﬀect

All CL’s measurements were made at surface pressure (1000 mb). It is, however, of
interest to know what the Einitiation values for continuous streamers would be at the
lower pressures found in the regions where lightning initiates. We therefore calculated
Einitiation for continuous streamers for a range of pressures.

The variation of Einitiation for continuous streamers with both pressure and drop
size is shown in Fig 7. The dark region in the lower left corner indicates the region in
which initiation is most favorable - large L and low pressure. Over the chosen ranges of
pressure and L, pressure has a greater eﬀect on Einitiation than L.

Fig 7 indicates that Einitiation varies linearly with pressure. We consider the de-
pendence of the various parameters used by the model: α, η, D and v are functions of
E/p while the µ and f1 · f2 are functions of l · p. The linear dependence of Einitiation for
continuous streamers suggests that the dependence on E/p dominates and that there is
a unique value of the “reduced” E-ﬁeld, Yinitiation = Einitiation/p for a particular E and
p combination.

(e) Propagation

The E-ﬁeld necessary to sustain stable streamer propagation, Epropagation(p), was
measured by [Griﬃths & Phelps, 1976b] as a function of air pressure, p. These stable
streamers, once initiated, will continue to propagate provided Einitiation ≥ Epropagation.
Griﬃths and Phelps found that Epropagation ∼ 400 kV/m for dry air at p = 1000 mb and
that Epropagation(p) ∝ p5 (Fig 9). At p = 500 mb Epropagation ∼ 150 kV/m for dry air.

At p = 1000mb Fig 7 shows that Einitiation > 400 kV/m for all L. These initiated
streamers will therefore be able to propagate over the entire length of the region in which
Eexternal remains constant. In thunderclouds this scale is typically hundreds of meters.
At lower pressures Einitiation > Epropagation over a large range of L.

5. Discussion

In this paper we have shown that continuous, propagating streamers can be initi-
ated from water drops at E-ﬁelds found in thunderstorms. Provided that Einitiation(p) ≥
Epropagation(p), these streamers are capable of propagating over considerable distances.
This distance is limited by the size of the region in which Eexternal is greater than
Epropagation(p).

When the electron currents in streamers become large enough, Joule heating pro-
duces a ’warm’ leader; a channel in which thermodynamic equilibrium is destroyed and
hydrodynamic eﬀects become important. This is commonly referred to as the ’stepped-
leader’ in the cloud-to-ground lightning context. The currents carried by individual
streamers initiated at the drops are several orders of magnitude too low to produce
leaders [Bondiou, 1997]. These streamers may, however, still eventually lead to leaders if
they can be combined or multiplied.

Griﬃths & Phelps [1976] considered the role of small scale discharges in thunder-
clouds, calculating the E-ﬁeld enhancement due to multiple propagations of positive
streamers near an electrode. According to their model, a series of three to seven stream-
ers gave rise to an enhanced E-ﬁeld of up to ∼ 1500 kV/m in a region of several meters
in linear scale near the electrode. It is possible that several continuous streamers ini-
tiated from drops in the thundercloud could provide the required ﬁeld enhancement.
[Griﬃths & Phelps, 1976] found that the ﬁeld was intensiﬁed on a time scale of ∼ 1 ms,
which is comparable to the lifetime of the coalesced drops as measured by CL. Further
investigation is required to determine whether a hydrometeor is capable of initiating
multiple streamers.

An alternate mechanism for leader formation would be the combination of several
streamers in close proximity to one another to form a single, more vigorous streamer with
suﬃcient current to transform it to the “warm” leader stage. If we think of drops that
initiate continuous streamers as “electrodes” then the number of “electrodes” available
increases with increasing E (see Fig 6). Thus the likelihood of several streamers initiating
in close proximity increases and the chance of leader formation is increased. This is also
in keeping with the observations of large amounts of corona activity in thunderstorms
without lightning. Only if the “electrode” density is suﬃciently high will streamers be
able to merge and form a leader. These possible mechanisms for leader formation require
further investigation.

The streamers observed by both CL and examined in our model were all positive,
occuring at the lower end of drops. This corresponds to drops located above the neg-
ative charge center in clouds. Leader formation in this region is observed to lead to
intra-cloud lightning ﬂashes. Drops located below the negative charge center have neg-
atively charged lower ends and investigation of this situation will require the modeling
of negative streamers which are much more complex in nature than positive streamers
[Castellani et al, 1994]. Leader formation in this region (below the negative charge cen-
ter) will lead to cloud to ground lightning. No attempt has been made in this paper to
model these negative processes but future attempts should investigate this phenomena.
Finally, while we have concentrated on liquid hydrometeors, future work should
incorporate ice particles as possible “electrodes”. This may explain how lightning initia-
tion can occur at higher altitudes near the upper positive charge center in thunderclouds
where there is little or no liquid water available.

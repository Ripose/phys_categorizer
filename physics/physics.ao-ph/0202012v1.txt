This paper presents a wavelet multiresolution analysis of a time series dataset to study the corre-
lation between the real temperature data and three temperature model reconstructions at diﬀerent
scales. We show that the Mann et.al. model reconstructs the temperature better at all temporal
resolutions. We show and discuss the wavelet multiresolution analysis of the Mann’s temperature
reconstruction for the period from 1400 to 2000 A.D.E.

I. INTRODUCTION

A.D.E.)

The study of past climate trends, or variability is abso-
lutely imperative if any kind of prediction is to be made
about the future of our global environment, [1]. With
the goal of understanding how our climate has changed
in the past, several diﬀerent models have been developed
from various Paleoclimatology proxies, [2]. These proxy
records, located all over the globe, are inherent in re-
construction temperature trends from periods before in-
strumentation records are available. These longer tem-
perature records are necessary due to the short span of
actual temperature records taken via instrumentation.
The longer the time series of temperature data avail-
able the better a long term prediction of future tem-
perature behavior can be made. These proxy data sets
include information recovered from the records of tree
rings, pollen samples, ice cores, corals, marine sediments
as well as others. The models constructed, in order to be
more accurate, take into account many diﬀerent proxies
in determining past climate trends. This paper makes
a comparison of these climate models with instrumenta-
tion readings in a new way. The results show that the
model produced by Mann et al. [3] gives a slightly better
ﬁt to known temperature values than several of the other
paleoclimate models.

II. TEMPERATURE MODELS

There are three climate models compared in this paper,
Fig. 1. The comparisons are made to known temperature
anomaly data taken via instrumentation and reported by
Jones et al. [4]. This data set is largely considered as the
most accurate global temperature data set known. The
models compared are those of Mann et al, [3], [5] Briﬀa et
al, [6], [7] and Jones et al. [8], [9] These models all contain
at a minimum data from the years 1400 A.D.E. to 1980
A.D.E. (All dates from this point are to be considered

1

The Jones et al. [8], [9] dataset was generated by aver-
aging 17 temperature reconstructions from both hemi-
spheres. These sites, once averaged together, form a
dataset 1000 years long with a temporal resolution of
1 year. The proxy data types utilized were tree rings,
ice cores, corals and historical documents. The Mann et
al [3], [5] data was a reconstruction from sites globally
and extends from the years 1400-1980. The reconstruc-
tion was performed utilizing proxy data from tree rings,
ice core, ice melt, long historical records (from Bradley
and Jones [10]), coral, and long instrumentation records.
The Briﬀa et al [6] [7] dataset extends from 1400-1994
and was a reconstruction utilizing only tree ring data.

III. WAVELET MULTIRESOLUTION ANALYSIS

Wavelet analysis [11] is a new powerful method to an-
alyze time series. Wavelet Transform makes use of scal-
ing functions, the wavelets, that have the characteristics
of being localized in space and in frequencies. These
functions must integrate to zero and the square of them
must integrate to unity. A scaling coeﬃcient τ character-
izes a wavelet. The length 2τ measures the width of the
wavelet. Two typical wavelets widely used in the con-
tinuous wavelet transform are the Haar wavelet and the
Mexican hat wavelet [11]. The Haar wavelet is deﬁned
by

1/√2τ ,

The Mexican hat wavelet is the second derivative of a
Gaussian. The length 2τ deﬁnes the scale analyzed by
the wavelet. Given a signal ξ(u), the Continuous Wavelet
Transform is deﬁned by

W (τ, t) =

˜ψτ,t(u) ξ(u) du .

The double integral of Eq. (3) suggests that the original
signal may be decomposed in “continuous details” that
depend on the scale coeﬃcient τ . However, it is not easy
to handle the results of the Continuous Wavelet Trans-
form because of the continuous nature of the decomposi-
tion. There exists a discrete version of the wavelet trans-
form, the Maximum Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform
(MODWT), which is the basic tool needed for studying
time series of N data via wavelet. In the book of Percival
and Walden, “Wavelet Methods for Time Series Analy-
sis [11], the reader can ﬁnd all mathematical details. For
the purpose of this paper, it is important to have in mind
only one of the important properties of the MODWT, the
Wavelet Multiresolution Analysis (WMA). It is possible
to prove that given an integer j0 such that 2j0 < N ,
where N is the number of the data, the original time
series represented by the vector X can be decomposed
in:

with

X = SJ0 +

Dj ,

J0

Xj=1

Sj−1 = Sj + Dj .

(4)

(5)

The detail Dj represents changes on a scale of 2τ = 2j,
while the smooth SJ0 represents averages of a scale of
2τ = 2J0. To better appreciate the WMA, Fig. 2 shows
the WMA of the temperature in the years 1860-2000.
The analysis is done by using the Daubechies least asym-
metric scaling wavelet ﬁlter (LA8) [11]. LA8 wavelet look
similar to the Mexican hat but they are asymmetric. We
plot the WMA for J0 = 4. Fig. 2a shows the tempera-
ture (dashed line) and the smooth average S4 (solid line).
Figs. 2b-e show the details D4, D3, D2, D1. Detail D4
shows the presence of irregular oscillations with a period
of almost 20-22 years. Detail D3 shows the presence of
more regular oscillations with a period of almost 10-11
years. Details D2 and D1 show the ﬂuctuations of the
temperature at scale 2τ = 22 = 4 and 2τ = 21 = 2
years respectively. According to Eqs. (4) and (5), the
sum of all four details and the smooth average S4 give
the original signal. The smooth average S3 is given by
S4 +D4. The smooth averages S2 and S1 can be obtained
by summing ﬁrst D3 and then D2 to S3 respectively.

The use of the Multiresolution Correlation Analysis via
wavelet is a simple procedure. We decompose the tem-
perature data and the three temperature reconstructions
by Briﬀa, Jones and Mann by using WMA introduced in
the previous section. Then we evaluate the linear correla-
tion coeﬃcient r between the real temperature data and
each of the reconstructions for each smooth average and
each detail. For pairs of quantities (xi; yi); i = 1, ..., N ,
the linear correlation coeﬃcient r is given by the formula

r =

i (xi

x) (yi

y)

−
x)2

P
i (xi

−

qP

qP

,

−
i (yi

y)2

−

(6)

where, as usual, x is the mean of the x, y is the mean of
the y. The value of r lies between -1 and 1, inclusive. It
takes on a value of 1, termed “completely positive cor-
relation,” when the data points lie on a perfect straight
line with positive slope, with x and y increasing together.
The value 1 holds independent of the magnitude of the
slope. If the data points lie on a perfect straight line with
negative slope, y decreasing as x increases, then r has the
value -1; this is called “completely negative correlation.”
A value of r near zero indicates that the variables x and
y are uncorrelated. When a correlation is known to be
signiﬁcant, r is one conventional way of summarizing its
strength. Because we want to determine which temper-
ature model reproduces better the real temperature at
each scale, the best model is the one that gives a linear
correlation coeﬃcient r closest to 1. Table 1 shows the
correlation coeﬃcient between the real temperature data
and each of the reconstruction for each smooth average
and each detail.

Table 1 shows clearly that Mann’s model is the best
one in all cases, because its linear correlation coeﬃcient
is the closest to 1 for each analysis. Briﬀa’s model is the
worst one. However, if we analyze the details, Briﬀa’s
model is better than Jones’ model. This is information
that a simple look at Fig. 1 could not determine. More-
over, the linear correlation coeﬃcients for the smooth
averages are closer to 1 than the correlation coeﬃcients
concerning the details. This suggests that the models are
made in such a way to reproduce better the smooth aver-
ages than the details. Finally, we observe that the worst
correlation is for the details D3 in all cases. This is very
interesting because, as shown in Fig. 2c, the details D3
represents changes on a scale of 2τ = 23 = 8 years that
evidence the 10-11 years temperature periodicity that is
connected with the 11 years solar cycle. The low value of
r for the details D3 suggests that the models give results
uncorrelated to real data because of a random shifting.
Fig 3 shows the comparison between the details D4, D3,
D2 and D1 from Wavelet Multiresolution Analysis of the
temperature reconstruction by Mann’s model (solid line)

2

and the real temperature (dashed line) during the year
period (1856 - 1980). Figs. 3a, 3c and 3d show that the
details D4, D2 and D1 of the temperature reconstruction
aﬀorded by Mann’s model are satisfactorily correlated to
the corresponding properties of the data concerning real
temperature. As for D3, illustrated in Fig. 3b, we no-
tice a kind of random shift between reconstruction and
real temperature curve. In some time regions the max-
ima and minima of the reconstruction curve occur earler,
and in other time regions they occur later. However, the
period and teh amplitude of the 10-11 year cycle seem to
be the same in both cases.

V. MANN’S MODEL ANALYSIS

In the previous section we proved that the Mann’s
model is the one that produces the most accurate temper-
ature reconstruction of the real temperature data. The
quality of agreement between temperature reconstruction
and real temperature becomes unsatisfactory only for the
wavelet detail D3, a detail of some importance since it
refers to the time scale 2τ = 23 = 8 years, which is
very close to the 10-11 year solar cycle. Figs. 4 show
the WMA of the Mann’s temperature reconstruction in
the period 1400-1980 for J0 = 4. Fig. 4a shows the
Mann temperature model (dashed line) and the smooth
average S4 (solid line).The detail D4 of Fig. 4b shows
that the fastest changes on a scale of 2τ = 24 = 16 years
happened during the periods 1485-1530, 1615-1660, 1685-
1710, 1760-1790 and 1810-1840. The detail D1 of Fig. 4e
shows that the changes on a scale of 2τ = 21 = 2 year
during the period 1700-1980 look stronger than those
during the period 1400-1700. Further research is needed
to determine whether the eﬀect observed in the detail D1
is natural or is due to a lack of precision of the data used
to reconstruct the temperature. Finally, Fig. 5 shows
the smooth average S3 (solid line) for Mann’s tempera-
ture reconstruction in the period 1400-1980. The dashed
line is the real temperature during the years 1856-2000.
The smooth average S3 is the best smooth reconstruction
of the temperature that can be done. In fact in Section 4,
we proved that the correlation between the real temper-
ature and the temperature reconstruction fails for details
D3. Therefore, it is not realistic to include those details,
as well as the details D2 and D1, in a plausible smooth
reconstruction of the temperature. However, in accor-
dance again with the results of Section 4, the details D2
and D1 may be considered good enough for studying the
changes on the scales of 2τ = 22 = 4 and 2τ = 21 = 2
years, respectively. Fig. 5 shows that the coldest pe-
riod occurred during the years 1455-1475. From 1500 to
1920 the temperature had little ﬂuctuation, only slightly
more than 0.1 degree. There was a warm period from
1765-1778. Since 1920 the temperature had the highest
growth in the last six centuries, almost 0.7 degree. The

3

temperature decreased slightly during the period 1945-
1975 and then it started to increase again during the last
25 years.

VI. CONCLUSION

The conclusions clearly show that, at a minimum,
wavelet analysis is a useful technique for comparison of
these datasets. The superior dataset appears to be the
Mann et al. [3], [5]. Future work will include utilizing
this wavelet analysis technique in attempting to improve
the existing models or in constructing a new paleoclimate
model so that a better understanding of current and fu-
ture climate behavior may be obtained.

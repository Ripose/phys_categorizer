Latitudinal dependence of low cloud amount on cosmic ray
induced ionization
I.G. Usoskin, N. Marsh, G.A. Kovaltsov, K. Mursula, O.G. Gladysheva

A signiﬁcant correlation between the annual cosmic ray
ﬂux and the amount of low clouds has recently been found
for the past 20 years. However, of the physical explanations
suggested, none has been quantitatively veriﬁed in the at-
mosphere by a combination of modelling and experiment.
Here we study the relation between the global distributions
of the observed low cloud amount and the calculated tropo-
spheric ionization induced by cosmic rays. We ﬁnd that the
time evolution of the low cloud amount can be decomposed
into a long-term trend and inter-annual variations, the latter
depicting a clear 11-year cycle. We also ﬁnd that the rela-
tive inter-annual variability in low cloud amount increases
polewards and exhibits a highly signiﬁcant one-to-one rela-
tion with inter-annual variations in the ionization over the
◦
latitude range 20–55
N. This latitudinal de-
pendence gives strong support for the hypothesis that the
cosmic ray induced ionization modulates cloud properties.

1. Introduction

A possible inﬂuence of solar variability on climate has
been discussed for some time. Although the direct solar
inﬂuence on climate is apparent, variations of the solar irra-
diance are estimated to be an order of magnitude too small
to explain the observed changes in climate [e.g., Stott, Jones
and Mitchell, 2003]. Therefore, an indirect mechanism link-
ing solar variability to climate should be involved. Accord-
ing to some modeling studies, a response in atmospheric
circulation can amplify the terrestrial eﬀect of solar irra-
diance changes [Haigh, 2002]. On the other hand, cosmic
rays can noticeably aﬀect the Earth’s climate [Svensmark
and Friis-Christensen, 1997; Marsh and Svensmark, 2000;
Carslaw et al., 2002; Shaviv and Veizer, 2003]. While the en-
ergy deposited by cosmic rays into the Earth’s atmosphere
is negligible compared to that from solar irradiance, they
are the main source of ionization in the troposphere [see,
e.g. Bazilevskaya, 2000].

A possible qualitative link has been proposed that relates
cosmic ray induced ionization (CRII) in the troposphere and
cloud properties [Svensmark and Friis-Christensen, 1997;
Marsh and Svensmark, 2000]. Ions created by cosmic rays
rapidly interact with molecules in the atmosphere and are
converted to complex cluster ions (aerosols) [Gringel et al,
1986; Hoppel et al, 1986]. These cluster ions may grow by
ion-ion recombination or ion-aerosol attachment and thus af-
fect the number of aerosols acting as cloud condensation nu-
clei (CCN) at typical atmospheric supersaturations of a few
percent [Viggiano and Arnold, 1995; Yu and Turco, 2001].
Others have suggested that a CRII-cloud link could also
arise through changes in the global electric circuit aﬀecting
aerosol-cloud interactions at the edges of clouds [see, e.g.,

Tinsley, 2000, or a review of possible mecahnisms in Harri-
son and Carslaw, 2003]. Both mechanisms require that an
ampliﬁed eﬀect of cosmic rays on climate is realized through
the important role that clouds play in the radiation budget
of the atmosphere by both trapping outgoing long wave ra-
diation and reﬂecting incoming solar radiation. Although a
detailed physical model quantifying this connection is still
missing, correlation studies support its validity. Marsh and
Svensmark [2000] found a highly signiﬁcant correlation be-
tween low clouds below ∼ 3.2km (rather than clouds at other
altitudes) and the cosmic ray ﬂux during the period 1983–
1994. This basic result has subsequently been conﬁrmed
by other independent studies [Pall´e and Butler, 2000; Yu,
2002]. There is also evidence for the reduction of cloud cov-
erage during strong Forbush decreases at time scales of a few
days [Pudovkin and Veretenko, 1996]. This implies that the
proposed cloud-cosmic ray relation may also be signiﬁcant
at short-time scales. More recently Marsh and Svensmark
[2003a] found that the low cloud-cosmic ray correlation can
be extended until 2001 but only after the globally averaged
cloud data are re-calibrated. However, the variability in low
cloud amount (LCA) cannot be uniquely ascribed to a single
mechanism when using globally averaged data since the ob-
served long-term changes in the global LCA correlate with
diﬀerent solar-related indices including solar irradiance and
cosmic rays.

In this paper we study the spatial distribution of LCA
and CRII over the period 1984–2000. In all previous stud-
ies the count rate of a single neutron monitor was used as a
measure of cosmic rays, and assumed to represent the global
CRII1. Although useful for qualitative correlation studies,
this approach does not give quantitative estimates since the
cosmic ray intensity varies strongly over the globe due to the
shielding by the geomagnetic ﬁeld. Here we study the global
distribution of CRII and compare that with the measured
LCA distribution.

2. LCA-CRII relations during 1984–2000

studies

Following previous

[Marsh and Svensmark,
2003a], we use the low cloud amount obtained from the
ISCCP pro-
ISCCP-D2 database limited to IR radiances.
vides monthly observations of the global cloud cover based
on an intercalibration of up to 5 satellites for the period from
July 1983 to September 2001. Satellites detect a cloud when
radiance observations diﬀer signiﬁcantly from clear sky val-
ues. However, uncertainties can arise if atmospheric trans-
parency is inﬂuenced by processes other than clouds, e.g.,
aerosol loading from Mt. Pinatubo [Luo et al, 2002]. We
note that LCA as deﬁned from satellite observations is re-
stricted to clouds with their tops below 640 hPa (3.2km),

1 After submission of this paper we were made aware of the Ph.D.
thesis by E. Pall´e (The Queens University of Belfast, 2001) where
CRII was also calculated. However, none of the main conclusions
of this paper were obtained or discussed by Pall´e.

the global distribution of CRII has been

calculated for
the troposphere (0–10 km)
[Usoskin, Gladysheva and Kovaltsov, 2004].
First, the
electromagnetic-nucleonic cascade initiated by cosmic rays
in the atmosphere was simulated for diﬀerent conditions us-
ing the CORSIKA Monte-Carlo package [Heck et al., 1998].
Then the annually averaged ion production rate in the tro-
posphere at a given latitude was calculated using the re-
spective cosmic ray spectra parameterized by the average
heliospheric modulation strength [Usoskin et al., 2002]. Fi-
nally, the equilibrium ion concentration was calculated at
a given location, taking into account processes of recombi-
nation and aerosol attachment. Here we use CRII values
calculated at 3 km altitude which corresponds roughly to
the limiting altitude, as deﬁned by ISCCP-D2, below which
low cloud forms.

Time proﬁles of measured LCA and calculated CRII
are shown in Fig. 1 for diﬀerent regions, the correspond-
and their

a 5
grid is shown in Fig. 3a. One can see that the sig-
niﬁcant coeﬃcients are not uniformly distributed over the
globe. The correlation is high at middle latitudes but is
suppressed in tropical regions, leading to a moderate global
correlation (see also Fig. 2). A similar conclusion has been
drawn for total clouds by Svensmark and Friis-Christensen
[1997] and for low clouds by Marsh and Svensmark [2003a]
who suggested that ENSO dominates inter-annual variabil-
ity in the tropics.

LCA and CRII behave very similarly to each other at
middle latitudes, both depicting the dominant 11-year cycle
(Fig. 1c), but are somewhat diﬀerent in the tropics. While
the CRII time series has qualitatively the same form in all
geographical zones, LCA behaves diﬀerently. A strongly de-
creasing trend of about 0.2% per year is apparent in LCA
time proﬁle in the tropical regions (Fig. 1b) onto which an
11-year cycle is superimposed. The trend is also clearly seen
in the global LCA average (Fig. 1a) [cf., Marsh and Svens-
mark, 2003a], while the corresponding trend in CRII is close
−3/year). The trend is not uniform over
to zero (0.2 ± 0.5 cm
the globe – while the trend is mostly weak in mid-latitude
regions, tropical regions are dominated by areas of strong
decreasing trend. Such a trend can mask the agreement
between the variations of LCA and CRII during the pe-
riod 1984-2000. Accordingly, LCA can be decomposed into
a long-term trend and shorter-term inter-annual variations
around this trend. The origin of this trend could be related
to physical processes, e.g., a change in the global circulation
pattern or an increased loading of atmospheric aerosol, or to
an instrumental eﬀect, e.g., the inter-calibration of satellites
providing global cloud observations as suggested by Marsh
and Svensmark [2003a]. In the following only the detrended
inter-annual variations of LCA are considered. We suggest
that CRII is not the main source of cloud formation but
rather ”modulates” it, and that the long-term trend results
from other processes, which are outside the main focus of
this study.

Using a linear approximation for the long-term trend dur-
ing 1984–2000, LCA(t) = LCAo +B ·t, we have investigated
the detrended variations of LCA, ∆LCA ≡ LCA − LCA.
Fig. 3b shows the spatial distribution of c.c. between ∆LCA
and CRII. While the total area of signiﬁcantly negative c.c.
is very small and is not greatly aﬀected by detrending LCA,

areas of signiﬁcantly positive c.c. occupy a large fraction of
surface covered by the cloud data (see Table 2). We note
that areas of signiﬁcantly positive c.c. show a tendency to-
wards the geographical pattern reminiscent to that of warm
ocean currents ﬂowing from the equator towards higher lat-
itudes. Comparing the two maps in Fig. 3 one can see that
detrending LCA greatly improves the correlation with CRII
(see also Tables 1 and 2). This is also clearly seen from the
correlation between zonal averages of ∆LCA, and CRII rep-
resented by the thick line in Fig 2. Due to detrending of LCA
data, the latitude range possessing highly signiﬁcant posi-
tive c.c. (s.l.>90%) is increased from [50–55◦S; 40–70◦N] to

Using the latitudinal zones with highly signiﬁcant c.c.’s
(see Fig. 2) we try to quantify the relation between de-
4). For want of a phys-
trended LCA and CRII (Fig.
ical model relating LCA to CRII, a quantitative phe-
nomenological relation is assumed in the form of a di-
rect proportionality between normalized variations of LCA,
δ(LCA) = ∆LCA/LCA, and CRII, δ(CRII) = (CRII −
CRII)/CRII, where CRII is the zonal mean CRII value
during 1984–2000. The scatter plot of δ(LCA) vs. δ(CRII)
is shown in Fig. 5a. Despite the wide scatter of points,
there is a highly signiﬁcant correlation between δ(LCA) and
δ(CRII) (c.c.=0.6, s.l.>98%), with the corresponding linear
relation as follows:

δ(LCA) = (1.02 ± 0.08)δ(CRII).

(1)

The fact that the proportionality coeﬃcient is close to unity
implies that inter-annual variations of LCA around the long-
term trend can be directly ascribed to the variations of

X - 4

CRII. Moreover, the amplitude of cyclic relative variations
in δ(LCA) and δ(CRII) shows a similar latitudinal depen-
dence (Fig. 5b). These results strongly favor the idea that
the variations of LCA are related to CRII rather than other
mechanisms, e.g., solar irradiance, which cannot naturally
explain such a latitudinal dependence.

3. Conclusions

While in earlier studies data from a single neutron moni-
tor was used as a proxy of cosmic ray intensity, we have ex-
plored the quantitative relationship between temporal and
spatial variations of LCA and CRII over the globe for the
period 1984–2000. We suggest that the LCA time series can
be decomposed into a long-term slow trend and inter-annual
variations, the latter depicting a clear 11-year cycle in phase
with CRII. The trend whose nature is beyond the scope of
the present study, is strong in tropical regions and possi-
bly masks the LCA-CRII relation. We then ﬁnd a highly
signiﬁcant correlation between the detrended inter-annual
LCA variations and CRII over the globe (polar regions be-
ing excluded). A quantitative regression model was obtained
(Eq. 1), which implies a one-to-one relation between the
relative variations of LCA and CRII over the latitude range
◦
20–55
N. The amplitude of relative variations
in LCA was found to increase polewards, in accordance with
the amplitude of CRII variations but in contrast to the in-
solation which decreases polewards. These results thus sup-
port the idea that LCA is modulated by CRII, rather than
by solar irradiance, at inter-annual timescales between 1984-
2000.

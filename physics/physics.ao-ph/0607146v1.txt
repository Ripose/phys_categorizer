Abstract—A geoacoustic inversion technique for high-frequency
(12 kHz) multibeam sonar data is presented as a means to clas-
sify the seaﬂoor sediment in shallow water (40–300 m). The inver-
sion makes use of backscattered data at a variety of grazing angles
to estimate mean grain size. The need for sediment type and the
large amounts of multibeam data being collected with the Naval
Oceanographic Ofﬁce’s Simrad EM 121A systems, have fostered
the development of algorithms to process the EM 121A acoustic
backscatter into maps of sediment type. The APL-UW (Applied
Physics Laboratory at the University of Washington) backscatter-
ing model is used with simulated annealing to invert for six geoa-
coustic parameters. For the inversion, three of the parameters are
constrained according to empirical correlations with mean grain
size, which is introduced as an unconstrained parameter. The
four unconstrained (free) parameters are mean grain size, sedi-
ment volume interaction, and two seaﬂoor roughness parameters.
Acoustic sediment classiﬁcation is performed in the Onslow Bay
region off the coast of North Carolina using data from the 12kHz
Simrad EM 121A multibeam sonar system. Raw hydrophone data
is beamformed into 122 beams with a 120-degree swath on the
ocean ﬂoor, and backscattering strengths are calculated for each
beam and for each ping. Ground truth consists of 68 grab samples
in the immediate vicinity of the sonar survey, which have been an-
alyzed for mean grain size. Mean grain size from the inversion
shows 90% agreement with the ground truth and may be a useful
tool for high-frequency acoustic sediment classiﬁcation in shallow
water.

I. INTRODUCTION

The U. S. Navy has great interest in seaﬂoor characteriza-
tion due to its importance in shallow-water operations, such as
landing operations, mine burial, and safety of navigation. De-
termining a suitable route for communications cables, requires
detailed knowledge of the seaﬂoor and is another application
for characterization of the ocean bottom.

Obtaining and analyzing physical core samples or grab sam-
ples provides an accurate characterization of the seaﬂoor, how-
ever, it is a time-consuming process and is not generally per-
formed with sufﬁcient coverage on an ocean survey. As an alter-
native, acoustic seaﬂoor characterization allows adequate cov-
erage in much less time and, since sonar data is often collected
on surveys, no additional data collection is required. The acous-
tic data evaluated in this paper was collected in Onslow Bay
with the 12 kHz Simrad EM 121A Multibeam Echo Sounder.

A. Sediment Types

One of the most useful descriptors for bottom characteriza-
tion is sediment type based on the mean grain diameter, which

grain size according to

where d is the mean grain diameter in mm and d0 is the refer-
ence diameter 1 mm. Approximate φ values for selected sed-
iments are given in Table I according to the Wentworth scale
[1].

B. Onslow Bay

Onslow Bay off the coast of North Carolina is a challenging
region for high-frequency acoustic sediment classiﬁcation be-
cause the bottom is dynamic (sediment drift) [2], heterogeneous
in areas [3], [4] with shells, etc., mixed with the sediment, and
is often composed of a hard bottom [4], [5] covered with only
a thin (few centimeters or less) layer of sediment. The sonar
data set from this survey is raw hydrophone data along the three
parallel shiptracks depicted in Fig. 1 that are more or less par-
allel to the coastline. Shiptrack 1 has 250 – 300 m water depth
and is farthest from shore near the continental-shelf break. The
seaﬂoor slopes up to 0.5◦ in a direction perpendicular to the
ship’s heading. Shiptracks 2 and 3 are in shallower water (40
– 60 m) about 80km from shore, seaﬂoor here on the shelf is
relatively ﬂat.

C. Hydrophone Data Processing

Each port and starboard arrays are comprised of 64 hy-
drophones. Each array is steered between -60 and 60 degrees
(negative being in the port direction) in one-degree increments.
However, both port and starboard arrays are steered at 0 degrees
so there are 122 steer directions (beams).

SHIPTRACKS AND COLLOCATED GRAB SAMPLES IN THE ONSLOW BAY

AREA.

1) Preprocessing: For each ping, header, raw data, and
PAM (Power Ampliﬁer Monitor) records are read from the tape
or a ﬁle. A number of samples (usually 1028) from each ping
are taken from the raw data record. Where applicable the be-
ginning sample is selected according to the value of the Time-
Varying Gain TVG and a hard-coded threshold. The effects
of Programmable Gain PG, Fixed Gain FG, and Time-Varying
Gain TVG are removed from the data. These computations are
made in linear space based on values obtained from the header
record. The data, now in units of digital number DN, are con-
verted to sound pressure level SPL. Values for this conversion
are taken from the header record.

At this point the data are still at baseband. To beamform,
the data are shifted to the original center frequency (12 kHz).
To avoid aliasing the basebanded data must be resampled at
a higher rate than the original sampling rate of 2.5 kHz. The
resample factor used is 16, so the resampling rate is 40 kHz.
The interpolation is done via a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
The slow data are transformed to the frequency domain with a
large FFT, shifted, then transformed back to the time domain.

After the shift to 12 kHz, the average roll, pitch, heave and
yaw for the given ping are computed. These values are then
used to adjust the absolute locations (in software) of the receiver
staves in the array and will enable the beams to be steered to
consistent beam angles relative to the seaﬂoor.

Following the motion correction the data are beamformed by
phase adjusting the frequency domain data according to the re-
ceiver locations and desired steering angles. Taking the inverse

8

FFT of these data yields a sound pressure P time series for each
steering angle. The travel time of the bottom return is identiﬁed
for each angle and an acoustic ray is traced out (here a constant
sound speed proﬁle is used because of a negligible sound speed
gradient) to the corresponding bottom returns in order to obtain
grazing angle.

The sound pressure for the jth time sample of the ith beam
is denoted Pij. The data are converted to dB re µPa and, based
on the known geometry, the sonar equation is solved for bottom
backscatter.

2) Backscattering Strength: Backscattering strength BS is

deﬁned as

BS = 10 log10

Ib
Iinc

,

(2)

where Ib is the backscattered sound intensity from an area of
1 m2 and Iinc is the incident intensity at 1 m from the source
[6]. The backscattering strength can be determined from the
data by using the sonar equation

BS = RL − SL + 2T L − IA,

(3)

where RL is the reverberation level (from the beamformed time
series), SL is the source level, T L is the transmission loss in
dB, and IA is the insoniﬁed area in dB re m2. The insoni-
ﬁed area is the area contributing to the received intensity and is
computed using the 3 dB beam footprint,

II. BACKSCATTER MODEL

The APL-UW backscatter model presented by Mourad and
Jackson [7], [8] treats the seaﬂoor as a statistically homoge-
neous ﬂuid and predicts backscattering strength BS as a func-
tion of grazing angle θ. The roughness of the bottom is de-
scribed in this model by the bottom height spectrum.

where h is the reference height 1cm. The Mourad-Jackson
model is valid for all frequencies between 10 and 100 kHz
and is used here to represent the acoustic backscatter from the
seaﬂoor.

Table II lists the six model input parameters, which, along
with the sonar frequency f and sound speed c in water at
the seaﬂoor, determine both the roughness backscattering cross
section σr(θ) and volume backscattering cross section σv(θ).
The six input parameters are dimensionless except for β which
has units of cm4. Combining these backscatter contributions
from roughness (acoustic reﬂections from a randomly rough
surface) and volume interaction (scattering of penetrating sound
from sediment inhomogeneities) results in

BS(θ) = 10 log10(σr + σv).

III. DATA INVERSION

The inversion problem is ﬁnding the set of input parameters
that best ﬁts the given data set. That is, which set of parameters
minimizes the difference between the BS vs. θ curve and the
measured backscatter data. The sum of the squares of the data
deviations from the model prediction is used as the measure for
goodness of ﬁt.

A. Parameter Constraints

If the six input parameters are unconstrained, the parameter
space to be searched is six-dimensional. However, since cor-
relations exist among some of the parameters, many solution
parameter sets represent solutions that are physically unlikely.
Hamilton and Bachmann [9], [10] describe a relationship be-
tween the parameters ρ and ν and relate both to the mean grain
size (φ) of the seaﬂoor sediments. Mourad and Jackson [7] pa-
rameterize ρ, ν, and δ according to φ values emphasizing the
top few tens of centimeters of sediment, and the parameteriza-
(Some
tion has been generalized to include coarse sand [8].

correlation exists between δ and φ, and the effect of physically
meaningful values of δ on the BS vs. θ curve is negligible.)
Gott [11] has used the idea of constraining some of the model
parameters with some success. In addition the parameters used
should be restricted to values that are physically likely. The
parameter ranges used here are presented in Table III.

The parameter space to be searched is now 4-dimensional (φ,
β, γ, α), and, since the backscatter model is highly nonlinear,
one must be careful not to simply ﬁnd one of the many local
solutions. Two of the most common global search methods are
simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. Both are suitable
for most nonlinear problems. Simulated annealing (SA) is the
best-ﬁt search routine used here (e.g. see [12]).

B. Simulated Annealing

With the SA approach one searches the parameter space by
continuously stepping to a new point in parameter space and
computing the sum of the squares E for the data point residu-
als. E is also known as the cost function. If the cost decreases
from the previous location, the step is accepted. If, however,
the cost increases, the step is only occasionally accepted. The
probability p that a higher-cost step is accepted depends both
on the amount of increased cost ∆E and on a variable referred
to as temperature t according to the Boltzmann distribution,

p = e−∆E/t.
This process is known as the Metropolis algorithm [13]. Local
minima are escaped because of the steps of increased cost. The

of a higher-cost step is zero. The stepsize is also reduced slowly
as the algorithm settles into the global minimum.

IV. RESULTS

The data for shiptrack 1 (farthest from shore) was grouped
into bins of 200 pings covering an area of seaﬂoor approxi-
mately 3 km×1 km. The backscattering strengths in each bin
were averaged according to grazing angle, and a best-ﬁt pa-
rameter set was found via simulated annealing for the averaged
data. To illustrate Fig. 2 shows backscatter data for the ﬁrst 200
pings for shiptrack 1 along with the SA best-ﬁt model curve.
A comparison of inversion phi values with the analyzed grab
samples is shown in Fig. 3. All 58 inversions for the 200-ping
bins result in phi values indicating medium or ﬁne grades of
sand. The inversion phi values are in most cases only slightly
greater than medium sand measured at the nearest grab sample
location.

V. CONCLUSIONS

B. Shelf Region

Because of a higher ping rate, the backscatter data from ship-
tracks 2 and 3 are binned in groups of 500 pings each. Figures 4
and 5 (closest to shore) compare the phi values from the SA in-
version to the grab samples in the shallower water (≈ 40–60 m)
with 61 of the 71 inversion phi values matching the nearest grab
sample sediment type. Forty-three grab samples in the shelf re-
gion show a medium or coarse sand bottom with one sample
indicating gravel. The inversion yields 60 sand, 9 gravel, and 2
clay values. This region exhibits greater variation in phi values
than the slope region.

The inversion results are in good agreement with the ground
truth (both in sediment type, i.e, sand, and in grade of sand)
for the slope region where the sediment layer is known to be
relatively deep and homogeneous (near the continental shelf
break). The seaﬂoor in the shelf area, on the other hand, is
known to have little or no sediment layer and shells, rocks, etc.,
at the bottom. The inversion from the shelf region also agrees
in sediment type with most grab samples, however, there is of-
ten a discrepancy in grade of sand. Moreover, in a few cases
the phi value from the inversion is the lower limit (-1, i.e.,
gravel/coarse sand). Because the sonar frequency is 12 kHz,

the sound will penetrate any sediment layer less than about 13
cm (wavelength) deep and interact with the hard subbottom.
The backscattering strength predicted by the APL-UW model
in this case will be invalid.

Of the 129 inversions for the three shiptracks, 119 of them
(92%) agree with the nearest grab sample in sediment type. Av-
erage values and standard deviations are listed in Table IV along
with the percent agreement of the inversion phi values with the
nearest grab sample.

We believe the inversion method described here is promis-
ing for determining sediment type in areas of relatively homo-
geneous sediment and at least a few tens of centimeters deep.
This process currently also provides an approximation for thin
sediment layers or sediment with heterogeneous mixtures.

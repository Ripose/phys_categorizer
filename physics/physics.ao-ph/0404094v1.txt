1. INTRODUCTION

2. ELECTROSTATIC ANALOGY

Two main controlling factors of ice crystal growth
are the heat and (gaseous) mass transfers, H&MT,
as characterized by the Nusselt number (Nu) for heat
and the Sherwood (Sh) number for mass. Nu and
Sh express the increase of the molecular diﬀusions by
the relative motions of the particles in air as charac-
terized by the Reynolds number (Re). Traditionally
Nu is assumed to be identical to Sh. Past labora-
tory measurements with various ice crystal shapes
by the Toronto Cloud Physics Group involved Sh,
thus this study will deal with Sh. The growth of a
crystal depends on its size and shape, its fall speed
(through Re) and the ﬂux of water vapour from the
surrounding air.
It is controlled by the diﬀusion of
heat which carries away the energy released on the
crystal surface by deposition. Sh is a function of
Re and was established by Schemenauer and List
(1978)[S&L78] for snow crystals and graupel. Their
study, however, did not address the case of pure dif-
fusion (i.e. Re=0). Such values based on approxima-
tions have been available in the literature (McDon-
ald, 1963[Mc63], Jayaweera (1971)) only for a very
limited number of shapes of crystals. Thus, it was
decided to take a general approach to numerically
calculate ShRe=0 for any ice crystal with a recti-
linear shape. New values of ShRe=0 for additional
shapes of crystals are addressed in this study along
with the method developed for the computations.

The steady state diﬀusion is controlled by the
Laplace equation.
It was solved numerically with
Dirichlet boundary conditions on a rectilinear 3 di-
mensional lattice system with variable lattice separa-
tion distances for hexagonal plates, hexagonal cylin-
ders, stellar crystals, capped columns, and broad-
branched crystals.

The water vapour density ﬁeld (ρ) around a sta-
tionary ice crystal growing under steady state diﬀu-
sion obeys the Laplace equation

∇2ρ = 0

(1)

The initial growth of an ice crystal by the net de-
position of water vapour in steady state diﬀusion, is
controlled by the rate at which vapour diﬀuses to
and from the crystal’s surface. The rate at which
heat is released by the crystal is exactly the same as
the rate at which heat is diﬀused from the surface.
This balance leads to quasi constant value of crystal’s
surface temperature, and this in turn leads to a con-
stant local vapour density ρ0 around the crystal. For
a perfect capacitor that is geometrically similar to the
crystal, the electrostatic potential V in vacuum also
obeys the Laplace equation, with the surface electro-
static potential V0 constant as is the case for perfect
capacitors. Identifying V with ρ, the direct analogy
between steady state diﬀusion and electrostatics is
established. A capacitor that is geometrically similar
to the crystal is then set in a rectangular box, a Fara-
day cage, suﬃciently afar from its edges. The capac-
itor is then surrounded by the electrostatic potential
obeying Laplace equation. The sides of the cage are
set at potential zero to simulate “boundaries at inﬁn-
ity”. Since the water vapour tapers oﬀ to a constant
value suﬃciently far away from the crystal, imposing
this Dirichlet boundary condition preserves the sim-
ilarity. In this analogy, one uses Gauss’ ﬂux law and
Fick’s law of diﬀusion to establish that ShRe=0 is
given by

ShRe=0 =

4πCL
A

(2)

where A, L, and C are the surface area, charac-
teristic length, and the crystal’s capacitance, respec-

tively. The units are in cgs for ease of comparison
with S&L78 and Jayaweera(1971). Thus the prob-
lem of diﬀusion is reduced to ﬁnding capacitances of
crystals with the Dirichlet boundary conditions men-
tioned above.

3. FINITE LATTICES AND JACOBI’S
METHOD

To compute (2), a numerical scheme for ﬁnding
the capacitances for crystals of rectilinear shapes was
developed. “Rectilinear shapes”are those that can be
constructed with a ﬁnite number of straight edges.
A Cartesian grid system is established with a ﬁnite
number of lattice points within the Faraday cage, the
outer most points representing the edges of the cage
(box). Each side of the box is at least 20 times larger
than the respective sides of the crystal. The separa-
tion between adjacent lattice points can be diﬀerent
along diﬀerent axis directions. Each of the lattice
points are labelled in terms of positive integer in-
dices (i, j, k); where i, j, and k run along the x-axis,
y-axis, and z-axis respectively (Fig. 1). For sim-
plicity, µ is introduced, which can be either x, y, or
z. Then ˆµ represents the unit vector along µ-axis.
Assuming that the grid points are suﬃciently close
to one another, the partial derivatives of potential
V can be approximated by the following set of ﬁnite
diﬀerence equations

∂V (i, j, k)
∂µ

≡

V ((i, j, k) + ˆµ) − V (i, j, k)
δµ

(3)

where

A(µ) ≡ V ((i, j, k) + ˆµ) + V ((i, j, k) − ˆµ)

(4)

then the ﬁnite diﬀerence approximation of 2nd order
partial derivatives of V can be written as

∂2V (i, j, k)
∂µ2

=

A(µ) − 2V (i, j, k)
2(δµ)2

For convenience, following proportionality constants
are introduced:

α ≡ (

δy
δx

)2

β ≡ (

δz
δx

)2

Then the Laplace’s equation in our discrete rectilin-
ear grid system becomes

0 ≈

B(x)
2(δx)2 +

B(y)
2α(δx)2 +

B(z)
2β(δx)2

(5)

(6)

(7)

where B(µ)≡ A(µ) - 2V(i,j,k). From (7), one can
solve for potential V (i, j, k) at any lattice point
(i,j,k) in our Faraday cage. By rearranging the terms
in (7), the following is obtained:

V (i, j, k) =

αβA(x) + βA(y) + αA(z)
2(αβ + α + β)

(8)

is

the

This

expression used by

the “Ja-
cobi’s”iterative scheme for solving Laplace equation.
An algorithm is constructed that runs with (8). First,
the values of V are assigned to the sides of the Fara-
day cage and the surface of the crystal, which is
sitting in the middle of this Faraday cage. V is then
set to zero on all other lattice points, followed by
the running of a computational scheme for V(i,j,k)
iteratively for each lattice point in the box at each
iteration. The computation is started out from the
crystal surface, then “branches out towards the edges
of the box”. This procedure is iterated until con-
vergence by computing the diﬀerence δV (i, j, k) =
|Vn(i, j, k) − Vn−1(i, j, k)|, where Vn(i, j, k) denotes
the value V(i,j,k) at n-th iteration. The scheme is
halted when a desired “tolerance bound”is reached.
This occurs when following criterion is met

δV (i, j, k) < ǫ

(9)

X(i,j,k)

where the sum in (9) is carried out for all grid points
in the box. It is well known from literatures in com-
putational physics that the number of iterations ’r’
required to reduce the error given by the sum (9) by
a factor of 10−p is

r ∼ O(pN 3)

(10)

where N is the number of grid points in a NxNxN
cubic regular Cartesian grid system. At the end of
a run of this algorithm, values of all the V’s would
have been computed for each lattice point up to the
desired precision ǫ.

Some comments are in order at this stage. Al-
though no regular Cartesian grid system is used for
many of the crystal models studied here, the order
of convergence will be the same as (10). There
are other computational methods to solve Laplace’s
equation numerically, such as Gauss-Seidel and the
“simultaneous over-relaxation”(SOR) methods. The
SOR method has a convergence rate of O(N 2) for
3 dimensional Cartesian grid system. The classical

Jacobi method, however, is one of the simplest al-
gorithms that can be used for our study and is rel-
atively free of the complications in implementation
compared to the SOR method. It was thus selected
for this study.

the same respective lattice spacing as the grid for
the Faraday box.

Each of the “area element”is associated with a
set of integers I. Then the discrete approximation of
Gauss’ ﬂux law can be written as

4. EXAMPLE: HEXAGONAL PLATE

The hexagonal plate was modelled using a non-
regular rectangular grid system, with the proportion-
ality factors α and β not being equal. Only a ﬁ-
nite number of grid points is available for “drawing”a
hexagon to encapsulate the important features of the
crystal, namely its vertices. Not all the vertices of
the hexagon lie on lattice points if a regular (α = β)
Cartesian grid system is used. Hence a regular Carte-
sian coordinate system is not used for an optimal
design of the crystal on our ﬁnite grid. α=3 allows
for construction of a hexagon in which all its vertices
lie on grid points. β can be chosen to be any pos-
itive value since the plate is assumed to be thinner
than the lattice separation along the z-axis. Thus
β=1 was selected, meaning that our plate lies on a
single xy-planar layer of lattice points, in the mid-
dle of the box. This “optimal”representation of the
Nx
hexagonal plate results in the relationship: Nd =
2
where Nd and Nx represent the number of points
used to represent a diagonal segment, and horizon-
tal segment respectively.
In a similar manner, “op-
timal”representation was achieved for other crystal
shapes as investigated experimentally by S&L78 in a
“liquid tunnel”(Schuepp and List, 1969).

5. DISCRETE VERSION OF GAUSS’ FLUX
LAW AND SCALING RULES

A simple method of numerically computing Sh0
using the potential V for lattice points around the
crystal involves computation of the capacitance C.
This is done by applying Gauss’ law to compute the

Q
V0

“surface charge”of the crystal, via C=

, where V0

is the surface potential assigned to the crystal at
the onset of Jacobi’s method mentioned previously.
The total electric ﬂux of the crystal is obtained by
ﬁrst enclosing the crystal in a “rectangular cage”.
The sides of this cage are just one lattice point away
from the closest side of the crystal. Each side of
this enclosure consists of its grid elements, which
are called “area element grids”. These grids have

~E · dA ≈

IS

XI

−

∂V (i, j, k)
δµ

· Ai

(11)

which is just a sum of ﬂux through each of the area
elements. Note that in (11), the fact that on the
surface of a perfect conductor, the electric ﬁeld is
always perpendicular to its surface, was utilized. The
ﬂux through an area element whose outward unit
normal is in ±ˆµ direction is approximated discretely
by

F±µ = −

V ((i, j, k) ± ˆµ) − V (i, j, k)
δµ

(δν)(δγ)

(12)
where ν and γ are the other two coordinates not
equal to µ. The main reason for placing our rectan-
gular prism enclosure at most one lattice point away
from sides of the crystal is that such a construction
allows dealing only with ∂V
∂µ rather than with the
more complicated ∇V , when computing the ﬂux. It
is worth discussing the consequence of (12) for a spe-
ciﬁc direction µ. For the ﬂux through a face with its
unit normal in ±ˆz direction, the ﬂux through this
area element (12) reduces to

F±z = δx

[−V (i, j, k ± 1) + V (i, j, k)]

(13)

α
β

The main feature of (13) is that the only unknown
value is δx. The ﬂux through a face in any of the
other directions reduce to expressions of the form
(13). In all of these expressions, the only term with
unknown value and dimension is δx. For solving (8),
it is not necessary to know the physical value of δx
since all the quantities, except for V, are in dimen-
sionless form as proportionality constants α and β.
Thus, the numerical evaluation of potential V does
not depend on the choice of length unit; V can be
in whatever unit one desires. But (13) draws atten-
tion to the actual physical value that δx represents
in the grid system. But note that Q ∼ δx, and so
C ∼ δx. Thus, when computing Sh via (2), it is
seen that Sh ∼ (δx)
(δx)2 = 1. In other words, although
δx is unknown throughout our calculations, all δx’s
cancel out at the end because similarity numbers are

2

involved in our modelling. Only the relative propor-
tions of shapes and boundary conditions are of im-
portance. The actual physical length scales are irrel-
evant in computation of dimensionless numbers, Sh
and Nu, and this is well demonstrated in our model.
The total electric ﬂux through the rectangular
prism enclosure is calculated by summing the ﬂux
(12) through each of its area elements. From the
net ﬂux, the “surface charge”of crystal is computed,
and thus its capacitance. The Sherwood number
Sh at Re=0 is computed using (2), with δx carried
throughout all these calculations but cancelling out
at this last stage.

6. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The Sherwood number (Sh) for crystal shapes of
interest in a cloud physics environment have been
computed for zero convection (Re=0) using the
methods outlined above. The results are listed in

Using the analytical calculations of capacitances
of spheres and thin circular disks of radius r to
approximate the capacitances, Mc63, S&L78, and
Jayaweera have given expressions for capacitance for
the shapes listed in Table 1 (with the exception of
CC).

In summary, the numerical methods developed and
applied here provide convincing values of the molec-
ular diﬀusion of water vapour to ice crystals of vari-
ous shapes when compared with the values obtained
by approximations and extrapolations (Mc63).
It is
also of interest to see that the Sherwood number for
capped columns is not much diﬀerent from the value
for columns and that the ordering of the values for
Re=0 is consistent with the measurements of S&L78
at higher Reynolds numbers.

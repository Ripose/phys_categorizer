Abstract

In a statistial analysis of more than a entury of data we (cid:12)nd a strong onnetion

between strong warm El Ni~no winter events and high spring preipitation in a

band from Southern England eastwards into Asia. This relationship is an exten-

sion of the onnetion mentioned by Kiladis and Diaz (1989), and muh stronger

than the winter season teleonnetion that has been the sub jet of other studies.

Linear orrelation oeÆients between DJF NINO3 indies and MAM preipita-

tion are higher than r = 0.3 for individual stations, and as high as r = 0.49 for

◦

◦

◦

an index of preipitation anomalies around 50

N from 5

W to 35

E. The lagged

orrelation suggests that south-east Asian surfae temperature anomalies may

at as intermediate variables.

Introduction

The reent strong El Ni~no has stirred up again interest in possible teleon-

netions to Europe. A few in(cid:13)uenes have been mentioned in previous studies.

During the winter season, Sandinavia was found to be older and dryer just

after old (La Ni~na) events (Berlage, 1966), and an inrease in temperature

and preipitation with El Ni~no onditions was found in this area (van Loon

and Madden, 1981; Halpert and Ropelewski, 1992). Central European winters

would have the opposite tendenies: warmer and wetter (Kiladis and Diaz, 1989)

during ENSO warm events; this squares with the inrease of yloni Gro(cid:25)wet-

1

ter days observed in Germany (Fraedrih, 1994) and England (Wilby, 1993)

during El Ni~no years.

For the spring season after an El Ni~no event (Kiladis and Diaz, 1989) note

preipitation anomalies in entral Europe, and (Halpert and Ropelewski, 1992)

(cid:12)nd temperature anomalies in South-western Europe and Northern Afria.

Reently, new data sets of historial data have beome available. This has

opened up the possibility to hek existing onjetures at higher statistial sig-

ni(cid:12)ane levels. This study was initiated by a searh for an ENSO in(cid:13)uene in

the Netherlands through tropial storm ativity. Tropial storm and hurriane

ativity on the Atlanti is suppressed by El Ni~no (Gray, 1984), and many atas-

trophi downpours in De Bilt are remnants of tropial storms during the At-

lanti hurriane season. Unfortunately, this does not lead to an observable anti-

orrelation between the NINO3 index and preipitation (or high-preipitation

events).

In this artile we present a new analysis of the strongest statistial on-

netion between ENSO and the weather in Europe we did (cid:12)nd: inreased spring

preipitation after an El Ni~no event. In setion 2 we detail the onnetion for one

station, De Bilt in the Netherlands. The relationship is extended over Europe

in setion 3, and we searh for possible mehanisms in setion 4.

2 Rain in De Bilt

Two years ago we notied that there was a orrelation between the strength of

an El Ni~no, quanti(cid:12)ed by the NINO3.4 index

and spring (MAM) preipitation

1

in De Bilt (entral Netherlands) using data from 1950 to 1995. With a 3-month

lag the linear orrelation oeÆient was 0.30, with a nominal signi(cid:12)ane of 95%.

Given that we had onsidered more than 24 possible relationships, this result

was not very onvining. It hinged on one extreme event: in 1983 the spring had

been extraordinarily wet (see Fig. 1). Reently we used the preipitation series

bak to 1849 and forward to 1998

inluding a few more strong El Ni~no events.

Also, Kaplan et al. (1998) give a reonstrution of the NINO3 index

from

3

1856 to 1991. It uses only sea surfae temperature (SST) measurements, and

orrelates quite well with the Jakarta SO index of K(cid:127)onnen et al. (1998): r = 0.66
in DJF and 0.67 in MAM over 133 years in 1859{1996. From 1950 onwards we

use the NCEP analyses (Reynolds and Smith, 1994), over the overlap period

the orrelation with the Kaplan NINO3 is 0.97. An analysis using the standard

SO index (Allan et al., 1991; K(cid:127)onnen et al., 1998) gives essentially the same

results.

Figure 1 shows that the relationship between the winter (DJF) NINO3

index and spring (MAM) preipitation in De Bilt was on(cid:12)rmed in the new

analysis. The linear orrelation oeÆient is r = 0.35, nominally this has a
hane P < 10−4

of being random. The average of the four Duth stations

with data from 1867 (De Bilt, Groningen, Den Helder and Hoofddorp) gives a

orrelation of 0.40.

To quantize the signi(cid:12)ane of these relationships we used a Kolmogorov-

Smirnov test to ompute the probability that the preipitation distribution

with NINO3 index N3 < Nut
3
3 . The
averages and 2σ bands of these distributions of the De Bilt data are shown in
3 > 0.5: an El
Figure 2. The di(cid:11)erene is signi(cid:12)ant at the 99% level for Nut

is the same as the one with N3 > Nut

Ni~no tends to be followed by a wet spring. On the other hand, the e(cid:11)ets of La

Ni~na, inluding the suggestive drought in 1893, are not signi(cid:12)ant even at the

95% on(cid:12)dene level at De Bilt. For the four-station average this di(cid:11)erene is

also signi(cid:12)ant at the 95% level for Nut

3 < −0.5.

The signal has no onnetion with the North Atlanti Osillation (NAO).

On the one hand the NAO does not in(cid:13)uene preipitation in the Netherlands

very muh, on the other hand ENSO and NAO are only orrelated in the sum-

mer.

Spring rain in Europe

We investigated the extent of the teleonnetion using the NCDC gridded pre-

ipitation anomalies database (Baker et al., 1995). This ontains global data

from 1851 to 1993 in 5

5

bins. In Figure 3 one sees that the spring preipita-

◦×

◦

tion inreases after an El Ni~no in a zonal belt from England and Frane to the

Ukraine, with a weaker extension eastwards into Asia. There are two maxmima,

with orrelations oeÆients above 0.3 (without the 1998 El Ni~no): southern

England, northern Frane, the Low Countries and Germany, and another one

in the Ukraine entered on Kiev (r = 0.43). This last point was also noted by

Northern Afria and eastern Spain (r = −0.35), also noted in Kiladis and Diaz

(1989). In ontrast, the orrelation of DJF preipitation with the DJF NINO3

4 Possible mechanisms

Possible mehanisms of this teleonnetion have to explain the time struture of

the orrelation. The lag orrelations of the MAM preipitation with the NINO3

index is shown in (cid:12)gure 6. For referene we also show the DJF orrelations.

Although there is room for an atmospheri mehanism with a time sale shorter

than a month, the main signal seems to be delayed by 3{6 months. This agrees

with the observation that the orrelations of the MAM NINO3 index with

historial sea level pressure data (1873{1995, Jones, 1987; Basnett and Parker,

1997) are not very high, though signi(cid:12)ant. In Fig. 7a one sees that in a band

from the British Isles to the Ukraine sea-level pressure tends to be lower during

El-Ni~no events. The orrelation oeÆient r just reahes −0.20 (P = 97%) over
the North Sea and −0.16 in the Ukraine (P = 92%). It is on average a somewhat
higher in Northern Afria, r = 0.23 at the Straits of Gibraltar (P = 99%). This

is the orret struture to explain more rain in the dipole of (cid:12)gure 3. The lag-3

whih both orrelations are high will stand out in this plot, but a quantitative

preipitation index. One sees that the shape of the lag struture of the south-

east Asian region orresponds losely to the observed signal. Also the signal

in pressure (Fig. 7) is very similar to the lagged NINO3 signal over Europe

(Fig. 7b), but the North-Afrian opposite-sign anomaly has disappeared. How-

ever, the orrelation of the south-east Asia index with rainfall in Europe is

only 0.35, whih is lower than the lagged orrelation with NINO3 instead of

the higher value expeted for an intermediate variable. This may partly be due

to other mehanisms, suh as the diret link from the entral Pai(cid:12), but also

the nature of the measurements plays a role. Temperature di(cid:11)erenes in the

south-east Asia area are small: the MAM variane is only (0.28 K)2
than the (0.88 K)2

of the DJF NINO3 index. This inreases the e(cid:11)et of noise in

, muh less

the form of measurement errors, irrelevant land points and small-sale weather.

On the basis of the time delays of the signal we onlude that south-east Asia is

most likely the main soure of the in(cid:13)uene of ENSO on the weather of Europe,

with a smaller diret link from the entral Pai(cid:12).

The importane of the south-east Asia sea surfae temperature for the

northern hemisphere irulation is supported by data analyses and modelling

studies, see e.g. the review by Trenberth et al. (1998). In spring the most ative

11

teleonnetion is the North Pai(cid:12) pattern. This is the top half of Figs 7a,b.

The lower halves show an extension aross the North Pole into Europe. This

extension substantiates arguments using simpli(cid:12)ed Rossby wave propagation.

Unfortunately virtually all modelling studies have been onduted for northern

winter onditions, when the observations ontain a muh weaker teleonnetion.

Still, indiations of the pole-rossing response an be seen in DJF AGCM results

(see, e.g., Ferranti et al., 1994). One ould speulate that the spring transition to

the Asian and Chinese monsoon systems makes the irulation more suseptible

to perturbations. Further modelling work is learly needed in order to eluidate

the mehanism behind the teleonnetion to Europe.

5 Conclusions

Using more than a entury of data a lear in(cid:13)uene of ENSO on the weather

◦

in Europe has been established: spring preipitation in a belt around 50

N

from Southern England to the Ukraine tends to inrease after an El Ni~no and

derease after a La Ni~na. The strength of the orrelation is r = 0.49 for an index
of preipitation in this belt, r = 0.40 for the average of four Duth stations,
and r = 0.35 for the single station De Bilt. Other European teleonnetions

are weaker than this. The 3-6 month lag and orrelation maps suggest that

south-east Asian surfae temperatures may at as an intermediate variables for

most of the signal.

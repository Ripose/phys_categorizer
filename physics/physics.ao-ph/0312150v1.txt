acoustic source frequency, the inhomogeneities become
ineﬀective at refracting the ﬁeld beyond a certain ﬁne
scale determined by the acoustic wavelength. On the
other hand, ray methods are sensitive to inﬁnitely ﬁne
features. Thus, it is possible to complicate arbitrarily the
ray dynamics, and yet have the wave ﬁeld propagate un-
changed. This feature raises doubts about the ray/wave
correspondence. Given the importance of various anal-
yses relying on ray methods, a proper model should, at
a minimum, exclude all of the ﬁne structure that does
not signiﬁcantly alter the propagated wave ﬁeld when the
correspondence to the ray dynamics is being relied upon.
We develop a simple, eﬃcient, smoothing technique to
be applied to the inhomogeneities - a low pass ﬁltering
performed in the spatial domain - and give a character-
ization of its necessary extent as a function of acoustic
source frequency. We indicate how the smoothing im-
proves the ray/wave correspondence, and show that the
so-called “ray chaos” problem remains above a very low
frequency (∼ 15 − 25 Hz).

I. INTRODUCTION

As acoustic waves propagate long ranges through the
deep ocean, they are refracted by inhomogeneities in
the ocean’s sound speed proﬁle. Roughly speaking,
in the earth’s mid-latitudes, temperature and pres-
sure eﬀectively combine to form a wave guide in the
depth coordinate that vertically conﬁnes the prop-
agation1. In addition to this overall structure, the
ocean behaves as a weakly turbulent medium2 that
multiply scatters the acoustic waves mainly in the
forward direction. Whether one is intrinsically in-
terested in waves propagating through weak turbu-
lence or in the state of the ocean through tomogra-
phy1, ray methods are relied upon at various stages
and levels of complexity in the resulting experimen-
tal analyses3–5. It is therefore critical to understand
the applicability and limits of these ray methods.

Ray methods can only capture the physics of re-
fraction and reﬂection, unless a geometric theory of
diﬀraction is explicitly added6,7. Intuitively, one ex-

pects refractive eﬀects to dominate diﬀraction when
sound speed inhomogeneities are larger than the
acoustic wavelength of the source. On the other
hand, due to their pointlike nature, rays are sensitive
to structures at all scales. Thus, one should be sus-
picious of (non-diﬀractive) ray methods for models
that have signiﬁcant ﬁne scale structure that are in-
eﬀective in refracting waves, but that fundamentally
alter the rays themselves. Hence, certain ﬁne scale
structures in the model can be thought of as being
physically irrelevant, i.e. having no inﬂuence on the
wave propagation, and should be eliminated before
applying a ray method analysis. The possibility of
diﬀraction is very important, but should be dealt
with separately and we do not discuss it further in
this article.

Another serious challenge for the applicability of
ray methods that has been recognized in the past
ﬁfteen years or so, is the existence of ray chaos8; see
also earlier work in the ﬁeld of quantum chaos9–12.
One typical argument goes that chaos introduces
caustics, i.e. singularities, in ray methods at an ex-
ponentially increasing rate with propagation time
(range). Ray methods must therefore breakdown
on a logarithmically short propagation scale, which
renders them essentially useless. A signiﬁcant body
of work has shown that this need not be the case,
and methods can be developed which are accurate
to much longer propagation scales13,14. Even so,
detailed ray methods tend to become rather bur-
densome with the exponential proliferation of rays.
Thus, resorting to statistical methods based on the
chaotic properties of the rays is often attractive.

These two reservations about ray methods, inclu-
sion of physically irrelevant ﬁne structures in the
sound speed proﬁle and ray chaos, have often been
co-mingled. For example, it is possible to add very
ﬁne structure to a sound speed model that has no ef-
fect on propagating waves and yet generates chaotic
rays as unstable as one wishes. Our point of view
is that the two issues should be disentangled, neces-
sarily beginning with the removal of the physically
irrelevant ﬁne structures, whose characterization de-
pends on the acoustic wavelength. We will come
back to the ray chaos question, but leave a more de-
tailed and complete analysis for follow-up work to
this paper.

Our purpose is, thus, to create a practical and

1

easily implemented technique for smoothing inho-
mogeneities in a sound speed model, and to give
prescriptions for the extent of smoothing needed as
a function of source frequency. Toward these ends,
it is not necessary to mimic a realistic ocean accu-
rately with the model, but rather to include certain
key features, such as a simple form for the waveguide
conﬁnement and the ﬂuctuations due to the weak
turbulence. It is more than suﬃcient to include scat-
tering solely in the vertical spatial plane, to make
the parabolic approximation15 and to neglect larger
mesoscale structures. A simple ocean sound speed
model uses Munk’s canonical model16 to account for
large scale eﬀects due to temperature, pressure and
salinity, and an eﬃcient implementation scheme by
Colosi and Brown17 to generate much smaller inho-
mogeneities due to the ocean’s internal waves. Using
their approach, the inhomogeneities have the statis-
tics of the Garrett-Munk spectrum18. Although, this
may not be very realistic for the ocean’s very ﬁne
scale sound speed inhomogeneities, it is more than
adequate for investigating the length scale at which
ﬂuctuation features become irrelevant.

The outline is as follows. In Section II, the ocean
sound speed model and the method for acoustic
propagation are presented. The following section
considers theoretical issues such as the convergence
of the propagated waveﬁeld by asking the question:
“does adding more modes in the internal wave ex-
pansion cease altering the propagation beyond some
maximum mode number?”. In Section IV, a smooth-
ing of the expression for the internal wave sound
speed model is introduced. This smoothing is very
similar to the application of a low-pass ﬁlter - it re-
moves most of the structures in the sound speed
model that are shorter than a certain scale - but
it is done directly in the spatial domain so that ray
methods can easily be applied. Sensibly, the op-
timal amount of smoothing necessary is a function
of source frequency. We demonstrate the eﬀects of
smoothing on both the wave ﬁeld propagation and
on the phase space structures associated with the
underlying ensemble of rays. This does not, in gen-
eral, eliminate the consideration of ray chaos as the
Lyapunov exponents are still positive, but it does
remove a signiﬁcant amount of the so-called “micro-
folding”19 of the phase space structures. We discuss
how this can markedly improve the ray/wave corre-
spondence.

The governing equation is

2Φ(~r, t)

(1)

∂2
∂t2 Φ(~r, t) = c2(~r, t)
∇
Φ(~r, t)
}

{

where Re
is the acoustic pressure and c(~r, t)
is the sound speed at a location ~r and time t. The
mean sound speed is roughly 1.5 km/s and if we
consider a water parcel, the sound passes through
it far faster than any variation in c(~r, t) due to the
internal waves; i.e. the internal waves travel several
orders of magnitude more slowly than the acoustic
waves. Hence, it is reasonable to ‘freeze’ the state of
the ocean and let c(~r, t) = c(~r).

In anticipation of treating long range propagation,
we assume that the scattering in the azimuthal direc-
tion is negligible and the important components of
the acoustic wave ﬁeld propagation take place in two
spatial dimensions with ~r = (z, r), where z is depth
in the ocean and r is range from the source. Consider
a constant frequency source, i.e a pure sinusoidal
source of angular frequency ω = 2πf with frequency
f , whose amplitude is constant in time. Then, the
wave ﬁeld has a frequency response, Φω(z, r), where
Φ(z, r, t) = Φω(z, r) e−iωt. Under this ansatz, the
wave equation reduces to the Helmholtz equation in
cylindrical coordinates.

2Φω(z, r) + k2(z, r)Φω(z, r) = 0

where the wave number k(z, r) = ω/c(z, r).

A. The Parabolic Equation

For long range propagation, waves that propagate
too steeply with respect to the horizontal strike the
ocean bottom and are strongly attenuated. Since
the surviving waves propagate at small angles with
respect to the horizontal, a Fresnel approximation15
is possible which expresses the acoustic frequency
response as the product of an outgoing cylindri-
cal wave, eik0r/√r and a slowly varying envelope
function, Ψω(z, r), where the horizontal wavenum-
ber k0 ≈

ω/c0. Thus,

Φω(z, r) = Ψω(z, r)

(3)

Substituting Eq. (3) into Eq. (2) and dropping two
small terms gives the parabolic equation:

II. THE ACOUSTIC PROPAGATION MODEL

tuations are small, the wave equation accurately de-
scribes the acoustic waves in which we are interested.

The ﬁrst term falls oﬀ rapidly with range since
k0r >> 1. The second term is dropped due to the
parabolic approximation which assumes that for a
slowly varying envelope function, the curvature is
weak. Note that up to this point, we have also
dropped other terms from the propagation equation
in assuming negligible azimuthal scattering and neg-
ligible time dependence of the internal waves. See
the discussion in Ref. 22 for more details on all of
the terms that have been dropped and an order of
magnitude estimate for the size of the various con-
tributions.

B. Ocean Sound Speed Model

A simple model for the speed of sound in the ocean
consists of two main components. The ﬁrst compo-
nent of the model is an adiabatic, large scale be-
havior which is responsible for creating the ocean’s
‘sound channel’ - an eﬀective wave guide for acoustic
propagation in the deep ocean. This general behav-
ior has a minimum sound speed at the sound chan-
nel axis, and varies slowly with latitude and sea-
son, with the sound channel axis moving towards
the surface for higher latitudes and colder seasons.
Mesoscale variability is neglected in this study. The
second component of the model is local ﬂuctuations
in the sound speed due to the ocean’s internal waves.
These ﬂuctuations are much smaller in magnitude
than the wave guide conﬁning behavior, but describe
the range dependence. The model potential V (z, r)
takes the form

V (z, r) =

δc(z, r)
c0

=

δcwg(z)
c0

+

δciw(z, r)

(7)

where δcwg represents the change of the sound speed
due to the wave guide, which we take to be range in-
dependent, and δciw represents the ﬂuctuations due
to internal waves.

1. The Conﬁnement/Wave Guide

In the ocean, the main eﬀects of pressure, temper-
ature, and salinity create a minimum in the sound
speed. Since sound bends toward regions of lower ve-
locity, the shape of the sound speed proﬁle refracts
propagating waves toward the sound channel axis.
This eﬀect is captured in a smooth, average model
proposed by Walter Munk16 and is known as Munk’s
canonical model

where η(z) = 2[z

conﬁnement. This model has its minimum speed at
z = za and captures the right exponential and linear
trends near the surface and bottom. The parameters
are chosen to be B = 1.0 km, za = 1.0 km, c0 = 1.49
−1, which are roughly con-
km/s and γ = 0.0113 km
sistent with the well known environmental measure-
ments performed in the SLICE89 experiment23,24.

2. Internal Wave Sound Speed Fluctuations

Internal wave ﬂuctuations perturb the sound
speed in the ocean through the resultant vertical
motions of water parcels. They are responsible for
multiple, weak, forward scattering of acoustic waves.
A numerical scheme has been introduced by Colosi
and Brown17, which allows eﬃcient computation
of a random ensemble of individual realizations of
the typical sound speed ﬂuctuations. This scheme
conforms to the Garrett-Munk spectral and statis-
tical phenomenological description of the internal
waves18,25 and has the form

where we took ξ(z) = e−z/B
e−H/B with H the
depth of the ocean. The prefactor ej,kr introduces a
random phase for each j and kr in the sum. Since
the frequency of vertical motions lie between the in-
ertial frequency, due to the earth’s rotation, and the
buoyancy frequency, due to the local stratiﬁcation,
the sum over the horizontal wavevector kr has terms
representing the superposition of internal waves with
wavelengths in the range of 1
100 km. A maximum
for the j-summation has been chosen as Jmax = 180,
which gives structure down to the scale of roughly
a meter. The modes, sin(jπξ(z)), are connected to

−

the buoyancy proﬁle which is assumed to have an
exponential form. Although the form given in the
text above for ξ(z) does not vanish precisely at the
surface, it is suﬃcient for our purposes.
In order
for this paper to be self-contained, further details of
Eq. (9) are included in Appendix B for reference.

The model should enforce that both the function
δciw and its derivative vanish suﬃciently smoothly
at the surface. Thus, a surface ﬁlter is introduced
which consists of multiplying Eq. (9) by a contin-
uous function of depth with the properties that it
vanishes above the ocean’s surface, is unity below
200 m, and has continuous ﬁrst and second deriva-
tives. In this way, δciw/c0 and its derivative vanish
at the surface and are fully, smoothly restored be-
low 200 m. Since the upper 200 m of the ocean can
be quite complex with storms, seasonal ﬂuctuations
and latitudinal variability, there is no simple, general
sound speed model near the surface; the surface ﬁl-
ter is adequate for our purposes. We will propagate
waves for which very little energy will enter this re-
gion, and thus, little eﬀect of this surface smoothing
will be relevant. The speciﬁc form we have chosen
for the surface ﬁlter is

C. Initial Wave Field

The parabolic equation requires an initial wave
ﬁeld Ψω(z, r = 0) as input, which can then be propa-
gated to the desired range of interest. It is important
to understand the connection between the initial
wave ﬁeld and the localized, continuous wave source.
Typical sources can be thought of as point sources
whose acoustic energy disperses broadly. However,
due to the previously mentioned fact that all the
steeply propagating waves are strongly attenuated,
we can instead propagate only that wave energy
moving suﬃciently close to the horizontal (within
a spread of angles from the sound channel axis) that
would have avoided the ocean’s surface and bottom.
Restricting the propagation angles limits the size of
the vertical wave vector and necessarily creates “un-
certainty” in the location of the point source. For
our purposes, it is appropriate to choose Ψω(z, 0)

to be a minimum uncertainty wave packet. This im-
plies using a normalized Gaussian wave packet of the
form

which maximizes the horizontally propagating en-
ergy, and z0 = za, which centers the energy on the
sound channel axis.

z and σ2

z = 1/4σ2

A Fourier transform of Eq. (12) yields a complex
Gaussian distribution of initial vertical wavenum-
bers, kz, centered at k0z with standard deviation
in intensity, σk. Since σ2
k are the variances
of the intensity and not the amplitude of the wave,
their relation is σ2
k. By a simple geometrical
argument, a vertical wavenumber can be related to
the horizontal wavenumber by kz = k0 tan θ, where
θ is the angle with respect to the sound channel axis.
In the next subsection, it is seen that p = tan θ is
a generalized momentum for a classical ray corre-
sponding to the wave. Classical rays with the max-
imum angle θmax just barely graze the surface or
bottom, and thus, rays are limited in their vertical
wavenumbers. Yet, for Gaussian wave packets, all
wavenumbers are in principle present, though most
are weighted negligibly by the tails. It is the width,
σk, which determines if the wave contains wavenum-
bers large enough for a substantial amount of the
wave to hit the surface or the ocean ﬂoor. One can
determine a proper Gaussian width, in order for only
the Gaussian tails to pass the surface or bottom,
in analogy with the limiting classical rays by let-
ting the maximum classical wavenumber k0 tan θmax
correspond to three standard deviations out in the
initial Gaussian wavenumber distribution,
i.e. set
3σk = k0 tan θmax. Then

The explicit dependence of σz on the angular fre-

using the approximate relation k0 ≈
The speciﬁc choice of θmax depends on the verti-
cal conﬁnement. For the background conﬁnement in
Eq. (8), those rays departing the sound channel axis
with an angle of θ = π/18 (10◦) come within 150 m
of the surface, and those with θ = π/15 (12◦) come
within 30 m. The addition of internal waves to the
sound speed model causes some rays to have a closer
approach to the surface, so we will most often use
θmax = 10◦ in this paper.

D. The Classical Rays

From the parabolic equation, one can derive a
Hamiltonian system of equations for the position,
z, and generalized momentum, p, of the collection
of rays corresponding to the wave propagation. The
Hamiltonian is given by H = p2/2 + V (z, r) and the
potential is V (z, r) = δc(z, r)/c0. The equations are

method (where we have taken ∆r = 100 m in all
calculations).

The Lyapunov exponent, µ, is a measure of the
rate at which the rays are deviating under small per-
turbations. The relationship between the Lyapunov
exponent and the matrix Qr comes through the trace
(sum of the diagonal elements) of Qr,

Since dz/dr

mentum is p = tan θ. The classical action T is cal-
culated by imposing the initial condition T0 = 0 and
using the relationship

(15)

Through the parabolic approximation, the classical
action is directly related to the travel time, τ , of the
acoustic waves, where T = τ + r/c0.

The relevant rays to the wave propagation are
those appropriate for a Gaussian wave packet14,26,
which implies initial conditions in the neighborhood
of (z0, p0). Since k0z = k0p0 = 0 for the wave packet
in Eq. (12), ray calculations are done in a neighbor-
hood of p0 = 0. However, z0 is taken to be on the
sound channel axis, za.

The addition of range dependent internal wave ef-
fects to the sound speed model causes the classical
rays to be chaotic8. The stability matrix contains
the information about whether the rays are unsta-
ble (chaotic) or not27. At a ﬁxed r, one has

III. THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS

Wave propagation should become increasingly in-
sensitive to smooth perturbations as the scale of the
perturbations decreases to the order of the smallest
wavelength in the source and beyond. Considering
that the expression for the internal wave eﬀects in
Eq. (9) is a weighted superposition of a large num-
ber of vertical internal wave modes, this model pre-
sumably contains more detail than is necessary for
accurate wave propagation. There comes a point
in the summation beyond which the vertical modes
begin to add physically irrelevant features to the
sound speed inhomogeneities for a given source fre-
quency. To determine the transition point where
this occurs requires an understanding of the mini-
mum wavelength structure in the propagating wave
ﬁeld, and an understanding of the power spectrum of
individual vertical internal wave modes. The transi-
tion point, though, is not the only issue since higher
modes contain a mix of physically relevant and ir-
relevant structures. These issues as well as their in-
terplay are discussed here.

A. The Vertical Mode Number Transition

Intuitively, the vertical structures in the sound
speed model responsible for refracting the wave are
those that are larger than the minimum vertical
wavelength, λmin, in the initial wave packet. Ex-
pressions for λmin can be obtained by using λ =
2π/k and the previously noted geometrical relation
kz = k0 tan θ,

λmin =

2π
k0 tan θmax

=

λ0

f tan θmax

(21)

Recall that the ocean waveguide forces θmax to be
small so that the minimum vertical wavelength is
always enhanced over the source wavelength. For

θmax = 10◦, this enhancement is roughly a factor of
6. As a practical example, we note that some of the
experiments conducted by the Acoustic Engineering
Test (AET)3,4 use a broadband 75 Hz source. A
pure 75 Hz source has a 20 m source wavelength.
Thus, if the energy stripping due to the ocean surface
and bottom is consistent with θmax = 10◦, then the
wave propagation would have a minimum vertical
wavelength scale of roughly 110 m.

The vertical structures in the sound speed model
in Eq. (9) arise through the superposition of vertical
e−H/B)).
modes of the form e−3z/2B sin(jπ(e−z/B
Since the argument of the sine is nonlinear, each ver-
tical mode contributes diﬀerent oscillation lengths at
diﬀerent depths. The monotonicity of the argument
illustrates that each mode has a “chirped” structure,
i.e. each mode oscillates more and more rapidly as
the surface is approached. To make this more pre-
cise, an expansion of the argument of the sine re-
veals that the local oscillation length as a function
of depth is

λiw(z, j) =

2Bez/B
j

Therefore, the jth internal wave mode contributes
its shortest length contribution of 2B/j near the sur-
face, with longer length scales at increasing depth.
Each mode gives contributions to the sound speed
ﬂuctuations over a broad range of scales.

Figure 1 illustrates the depth dependence and
power spectrum of an internal wave mode. The
power spectrum has a fairly sharp high frequency
(short length scale) cutoﬀ from the structures added
near the ocean surface and a slowly decaying tail
for the lower frequencies (longer length scales). The
broad tail for an individual mode indicates that
many diﬀerent modes contribute to a particular size
feature in the internal wave model.

The transition vertical mode number Jtrans can be
identiﬁed as that point where the vertical modes be-
gin to introduce structure smaller than λmin. Thus,
setting Eqs. (21) and (22) equal to each other and
solving for j gives

Jtrans =

both the diminishing amplitudes and the detectabil-
ity of features by the wave is to look at the sensitiv-
ity of the wave ﬁeld to variations in the value for the
j-summation cutoﬀ in Eq. (9).

B. Wave Field Convergence

We can investigate the convergence of the wave
ﬁeld propagation by using diﬀerent values for the
j-summation cutoﬀ in Eq. (9) to generate various
sound speed media. The value of the cutoﬀ leading
to a converged wave ﬁeld, denoted by Jω, is the min-
imum number such that by including higher modes
there is relatively little change in the wave propaga-
tion. We do not have a simple intuitive argument
that gives an expression for Jω, but instead rely on
numerical simulations to determine reasonable val-
ues.

In order to discuss quantitatively what is meant
by ‘little change to the wave propagation’, it is nec-
essary to have a measure of the similarity of two
wave ﬁelds. An ideal measure is the absolute value
squared of the overlap (inner product)28. For two
sound speed potentials that diﬀer by ∆V , the quan-
tity, C∆V , often referred to as the ﬁdelity in other
contexts29, is deﬁned as

C∆V (r) =

where Ψω(z, r) is understood to be the wave ﬁeld
propagated to range r with the full potential and
Ψ∗∆V
(z, r) is the same initial state propagated using
ω
the potential which diﬀers from the full potential by
∆V . It is convenient to normalize the propagating
wave ﬁelds to unity since this is preserved under the
unitary propagation of the parabolic equation. With
this choice, the measure gives unity only if the two
wave ﬁelds are identical. The greater the reduction
from unity, the greater the diﬀerences between the
two propagations, i.e. the lower the faithfulness or
ﬁdelity of the propagations.

The full wave propagation is compared to wave
propagation for various values of mode number cut-
oﬀ J
Jmax. Thus, ∆V is the internal wave sum
for j in the interval [J + 1, Jmax]. Since deviations of
the correlation C∆V (r) from unity indicate that fea-
tures in the modes [J + 1, Jmax] were detectable by

the wave propagation, the value of J where C∆V (r)
breaks appreciably from unity determines Jω.

Sound waves with source frequencies of 25, 75, 150,
and 250 Hz were propagated to r = 1000 km; see
Appendix A for details regarding the propagation.
Figure 2 demonstrates the dependence of C∆V (r)
on J. To interpret this ﬁgure, consider the curve for
.995
75 Hz. Above J = 50, the ﬁdelity C∆V (r)
and remains near unity. Thus, we can say that here
50. Using higher internal wave modes adds no
Jω ≈
more realism, and only slows down the calculations.
A similar argument for the other frequencies gives
the values of Jω listed in Table I. Note that Jω in-
creases just a little more slowly than linear in source
frequency due, in part, to the decreasing weightings.

Since the correlation is inherently range depen-
dent, determining Jω from a correlation plot for a
single range is potentially inappropriate for longer
ranges. Yet, Figure 3 illustrates that the range de-
pendence of the correlation is fairly weak for a fre-
quency of 75 Hz. Increasing the range from 1000 km
to 4000 km for Jω = 50 decreases the correlation
very little from 0.995 to 0.98. Thus, Jω = 50 is a
conservative choice even for ranges up to 4000 km.
For reasonable source frequencies, it is clear that
even an optimal choice for Jω will leave a signiﬁcant
amount of oscillations in the model on a scale much
smaller than λmin (since Jω >> Jtrans). Presum-
ably, these oscillations are physically irrelevant for
the wave propagation, but it is worthwhile study-
ing more precisely where the cutoﬀ lies within the
context of long range propagation.

IV. FILTERING THE PHYSICALLY
IRRELEVANT FEATURES

The physically irrelevant features can be removed
by ﬁltering the high frequency components from the
internal wave sound speed model, δciw(z, r). The
ideal approach would be through the application of
a low pass ﬁlter: Fourier transform δciw(z, r) for a
ﬁxed range to a frequency domain, apply a ﬁlter
that removes the high frequencies and Fourier trans-
form back to give the physically relevant portion of
δciw(z, r). There are several drawbacks with respect
to proceeding this way. The Fourier transforming
back and forth is computationally expensive, cre-
ates a problematic ocean surface, and severely com-
plicates the ray correspondence; the same would be
true using a convolution technique. Instead, we de-
velop a smoothing that can be directly applied to
each vertical mode in the spatial z domain and serves
as a very good approximation to a low-pass ﬁltering
in the frequency domain. It takes advantage of the
monotonicity of the chirped structure of the indi-
vidual internal wave modes. The spatial ﬁltering
method simpliﬁes the ray equations enormously and
allows ﬁrst and second derivatives to be evaluated
exactly, as opposed to numerically, which is an un-
stable operation.

A. The Smoothing

Due to the precise oscillatory nature of each verti-
cal mode, a good approximation to a low-pass ﬁlter
can be accomplished by removing the upper portion
of the vertical mode that contains oscillations that
are smaller than the smoothing parameter, λs. This

8

involves multiplying each vertical mode by the func-
tion g(z; zsm, τsm) deﬁned in Eq. (10). This ﬁlter
is centered at the depth such that the local length
scale is λs, which by inversion of Eq. (22), gives the
mode-dependent depth zsm = B ln(jλs/2B). Note
that j must exceed 2B/λs in order for the ﬁlter to be
below the ocean surface, which is where it begins to
have an eﬀect. This is consistent with the shortest
length contribution of each mode being 2B/j at the
surface. The width of the ﬁlter is carefully chosen to
be τsm = 2.0λs so that it does not cut oﬀ too sharply
thereby introducing high frequency components into
the model. If the width were chosen much greater,
amplitudes of physically relevant length scales would
be reduced.

power spectrum, P , of δciw/c0. The dashed line is the
power spectrum of the unsmoothed full potential and
the solid line is the power spectrum of the smoothed full
potential for λs = 0.20 km.

Figure 4 shows the power spectrum of the sound
speed model with and without smoothing; it is il-
lustrated with a value, λs = 0.2 km. The power
spectrum remains relatively unchanged for length
scales greater than 0.2 km, but the length scales
below 0.2 km are signiﬁcantly dampened out of the
model. This is evidence that a smoothing parameter
of λs = 0.2 km is doing exactly what it was designed
to do: it is ﬁltering out features on scales below 0.2
km, but leaving features above 0.2 km in the model.
Figure 5 shows the smoothed sound speed potential
and the portion of the potential, ∆V , ﬁltered by the
smoothing. It is clear from these ﬁgure that the os-
cillations in the unsmoothed potential which have a
length scale of less than 0.2 km have been removed,
while larger oscillations have been preserved.

B. Estimating the Optimal Smoothing
Parameter

s

The optimal smoothing parameter, λopt

, would be
such that only those features in the model that are
not detectable by the wave would be removed. Intu-
itively, λopt
s would be very close to λmin of Eq. (21).
In order to test this intuition, we again use the ﬁ-
delity C∆V (r) deﬁned in Eq. (24), where here ∆V
is the high frequency portion of the internal wave
sum, which the smoothing removes, and the other
potential is the full unsmoothed sound speed model.
λopt
is determined to be the maximum value of λs
s
up to which C∆V remains nearly unity but deviates
signiﬁcantly beyond.

As in the previous section, source frequencies of
25, 75, 150, and 250 Hz were propagated to r = 1000
km with J chosen for each frequency to be that value
of Jω in Table I. Figure 6 demonstrates the de-
pendence of C∆V (r) on diﬀerent values of λs and
its interpretation is similar to that done for Fig. 2.
Consider the curve for 75 Hz. Above λs = 0.1 km,
the ﬁdelity breaks signiﬁcantly from unity giving
the optimal smoothing of the sound speed model
for a 75 Hz source to be λopt
s = 0.1 km. Smooth-
ing less than this allows high frequency features to
remain in the model which have no eﬀect on the
wave propagation. Table I summarizes the results
which all agree closely with the intuitive idea that
λopt
s ≈
For a ﬁxed λs, the higher source frequencies do
yield a lower ﬁdelity. This indicates that the high
frequency components of ∆V are more detectable
by a high frequency source than by a low frequency
source. This fully supports the age-old intuitive con-
cept that high frequency waves can detect smaller
features than low frequency waves, and that the ap-
propriate detection scale is a wavelength. A long
range propagation experiment utilizing a source fre-
quency f only detects that portion of the internal
wave power spectrum with features longer than the
length scale λmin = c0/f tan θmax.

λmin = λ0/ tan θmax.

C. Eﬀects of Smoothing on Phase Space
Structures

Classical ray methods can be used to reconstruct
propagating wave ﬁelds in detail through the use of
semiclassical Green functions30. The semiclassical
approximation to the wave ﬁeld is

9

Ψsc(z, r; k0) =

Aj(z, r) exp[ik0Tj(z, r)]

(25)

j
X

where the amplitudes, Aj, can be constructed using
information from the stability matrix, Eq. (17). The
sum is over all ray paths that begin at the source
and end at a depth z for a given range r, where T
is the classical action. This discrete set of paths be-
comes continuous if we consider all z. Thus, there is
a continuous set of rays that underlies the full con-
struction of Ψsc(z, r; k0) at a given range. A pow-
erful analysis of the properties of this set comes by
considering the rays in the phase space formed by
all allowable points given by position and conjugate
momentum. Viewed in phase space, the continous
set of rays underlying the wave ﬁeld propagation (in
the single degree of freedom problem being discussed
here) forms a continuous, self-avoiding line which is
called a manifold. As the range increases, the man-
ifold evolves into a rather wild-looking “spaghetti”.
The more chaotic the system, the wilder the appear-
ance of the manifold.

The construction of Eq. (25) relies on the use of
stationary phase approximations, which can only be
applied reliably when the phase between successive
stationary phase points is greater than order unity.
Care must be taken in deﬁning the meaning of suc-
cessive in this context. Thus, Eq. (25) breaks down
−1
0 = λ0/2π where j
when [Tj(z, r)
and j′ are the classical paths/rays corresponding to
successive stationary phase points. We term this the
‘area-(λ0/2π) rule’ (the translation to this problem
of the area-¯h rule of Refs. 9 and 10). See Refs. 13
and 14 for a detailed presentation of the breakdown
of the stationary phase approximation in quantum
chaotic systems.

Tj′ (z, r)] < k

−

The breakdown of stationary phase is intimately
related to how the manifold winds and folds its way
through phase space. The diﬀerence in the clas-
sical action for two rays is related to the areas in
phase space between the folds of the evolving mani-
fold and the vertical line of the ﬁnal depth, z, whose
intersections with the manifold specify the rays. If
these areas become smaller than λ0/2π, then sta-
tionary phase breaks down for that pair of rays and
we say that the two stationary phase points are co-
alescing. By drawing the manifold and ﬁlling in ar-
eas of λ0/2π in the folds, one can immediately see
where problems, such as caustics which produce inﬁ-
nite amplitudes, will be occuring in the semiclassical
construction. In the simplest case of two coalescing
points, an Airy function uniformization is possible.
However, if so many coalescing pairs occur that they
cannot be isolated from each other, uniformization
eﬀectively is no longer possible, and the semiclassical
approximation has broken down.

In the work of Simmen, Flatt´e, and Wang19, they

show how the ﬁne features in the internal wave ﬁeld
lead to a phenomenon they termed “micro-folding”
in which tiny folds are densely found along the man-
ifold. Clearly, for typical source frequencies in long
range propagation, the neighborhoods of the micro-
folds violating the area-(λ0/2π) rule overlap every-
where with each other. Thus, one anticipates a dense
set of singularities in the semiclassical approxima-
tion rendering the approach useless.

FIG. 7. Smoothed phase space manifold. The solid
line is the phase space plot for a dense set of trajectories
with launch angle θ ∈ [4◦, 8◦] propagated for 50 km in
the unsmoothed ocean model. The dashed line is for the
same set of trajectories, but for a smoothing parameter
of λs = 0.10 km. All the trajectories started on the
sound channel axis. The hatched rectangle is a reference
area for physically irrelevant microfolds and has an area
λ0/2π, which corresponds to a 75 Hz source.

Herein lies the advantage of smoothing the ocean
sound speed model of physically irrelevant features
before making the ray correspondence. Presum-
ably, the bulk of the micro-folding is related to
ﬁne features which are ignored by the wave prop-
agation. The smoothed system contains only that
structure necessary to describe the wave propaga-
tion so it should have fewer micro-folds. Figure 7
illustrates the eﬀects of smoothing on a set of tra-
jectories. One can see that the smoothed mani-
fold tracks the unsmoothed manifold along its length
very well. A more detailed example of micro-folding
is illustrated in Fig. 8 for a range of 100 km. Notice
how the smoothed manifold completely eliminates
this particular micro-folded structure for a smooth-
ing parameter of λs = 0.1 km (appropriate for 75
Hz). Eleven, non-isolated pairs of coalescing station-
ary phase points were eliminated by the smoothing.
Only a well behaved piece of the manifold with no
coalescing pairs remains. Thus, there are fewer loca-
tions leading to singularities and breakdown in the
semiclassical construction for the smoothed system,

point of view, the ﬁnite-range Lyapunov exponents
give something close to a Gaussian density31,32. The
ﬁnite-range Lyapunov exponents are launch angle
dependent33. Figure 9 shows histograms of the

D. Eﬀects of Smoothing on Lyapunov Exponent

The following question naturally poses itself from
the results of the previous section, “if smoothing the
inhomogeneities reduces the number of folds, per-
haps it is eliminating the ray chaos that was dis-
covered in Ref. 8?” This turns out not to be the
case. The Lyapunov exponents for smoothed sys-
tems do not vanish. The Lyapunov exponent, µ, as
deﬁned in Eq. (20), requires the inﬁnite range limit,
which due to the maximum range of the ocean, is
not very sensible. Instead, it is much more relevant
to work with ﬁnite-range Lyapunov exponents31,32.
The stability matrix, Qr, as deﬁned in Eq. (17), is
calculated for a classical ray starting on the sound
channel axis with an initial angle θ and propagated

It turns out that the mean of the ﬁnite-range Lya-
punov exponents is the usual inﬁnite-limit Lyapunov
exponent (as long as one has propagated beyond a
transient range of a few Lyapunov lengths). Letting

FIG. 10. Average Lyapunov exponents, µ0 and ¯µ, and
probability distribution as a function of the smoothing
parameter, λs. Both plots are for a range of propaga-
tion of 1000 km. The upper plot is an average of 2,000
trajectories within a uniform distribution of launch an-
◦
gle θ ∈ [−10
]. The solid line is µ0 and the dashed
line is ¯µ. The lower plot is the same as the previous
plot except that |θ| ∈ [8◦, 10◦] in both curves and the
smoothing parameter is varied. The solid line is for a
smoothing parameter of λs = 0.10 km and the dashed
line is for a smoothing parameter of λs = 0.30 km. A
narrow peak near the origin exists in the dashed curve,
which indicates a non-negligible fraction of stable trajec-
tories.

Although, there is still ray chaos, the Lyapunov
exponent is monotonically decreasing with increased
smoothing, but unless a smoothing greater than 0.10
km is applied, µ0 does not decrease appreciably. At
some point, beyond a smoothing somewhere in the
neighborhood of 0.3
0.5 km, a large fraction of
the rays behave stably. Note in Fig. 10 that for
λs = 0.30 km, a signiﬁcant fraction of the rays have
become stable, i.e., they have a Lyapunov exponent
equal to zero. Using the relation between frequency
and optimal smoothing, for source frequencies in the
25 Hz, there is a transition be-
neighborhood of 15

low which the ray chaos problem due to the inter-
nal wave inhomogeneities eﬀectively disappears and
above which it remains important over ocean basin
scale propagation ranges. This seems to be con-
sistent with some very low frequency experiments.
In particular, data from the Alternate Source Test
(AST) clearly shows that 28 Hz receptions have a
more stable arrival pattern than the 84 Hz recep-
tions for transmission over a 5000 km range34.

shorter than an acoustic wavelength should be in-
eﬀective sources of refraction, and not surprisingly,
this is exactly what our calculations show. How-
ever,
for vertical ﬂuctuations, the scale of inter-
est is not the source wavelength, λ0 = c0/f , but
rather the minimum vertical wavelength present in
the wave ﬁeld, which contains the additional factor
(tan θmax)−1; see Eq. (21). θmax is the largest an-
gle with respect to the horizontal that waves can
propagate without being stripped out by bottom in-
teractions and is typically in the neighborhood of
10◦
12◦ in the ocean’s mid-latitudes. For these
values of θmax the minimum vertical wavelength
is roughly 5

structures are much larger than that implied by λ0.
Parabolic equation simulations are unaﬀected by the
decision to include physically irrelevant ﬁne scale
ﬂuctuations in the sound speed model (except for
the resulting slower computation time), but this de-
cision worsens the correspondence of ray methods
to the wave propagation. Additionally, in probing
the state of the ocean, it is important to understand
what information is carried in the wave propagation
for a given source frequency.

The chirped structure of each of the internal wave
modes gives contributions to the sound speed ﬂuc-
tuations over a broad range of scales. Thus, limiting
the number of vertical modes used in an internal
wave sound speed model does not fully resolve the
issue of physically irrelevant ﬁne structure. For the
speciﬁc construction of Colosi and Brown, our calcu-
lations gave frequency dependent values for the num-
ber of vertical modes Jω necessary in the model. For
frequencies of
Hz, we found that
the wave ﬁeld propagation is essentially converged
for Jω =
, respectively. However,

for the same set of frequencies, modes greater than

Hence, each mode contains a large spread of fre-

quency contributions so that a low-pass ﬁltering of
each vertical mode is needed. An approximation to
a low-pass ﬁlter was constructed in the position do-
main by taking advantage of the monotonicity of the
chirped structure of each mode. The accuracy of this
approximation (though not shown in this paper) was
very good for individual modes. The spatial ﬁlter-
ing method gives three main advantages: reducing
required computations, better behavior in the neigh-
borhood of the ocean’s surface, and simplicity with
respect to making the ray correspondence.

Using a more realistic sound speed model for
the waveguide would also require the elimination of
structure on a ﬁner scale than the optimal smooth-
ing. Though, this would not likely be subject to
as simple a spatial ﬁltering scheme as we used for
the internal waves, some low-pass ﬁltering technique
would be needed. It would still be desirable to main-
tain a good ocean surface description and simplicity
in the ray equations, though.

In Table I, Jω appears to scale more slowly with
increasing frequency than Jtrans. This can be ex-
plained by the decreasing weighting of the terms in
Eq. (9), which directly inﬂuences the convergence of
the wave ﬁeld propagation and the value of Jω. If
this trend continues, at a suﬃciently high frequency,
Jtrans will become equal to Jω and will exceed Jω for
all higher frequencies. Beyond this frequency, low-
pass ﬁltering would no longer serve any purpose; one
could simply choose an appropriate Jω. We do not
attempt to extrapolate to that point here using our
calculations and model, but note that wherever it is,
the frequency would be so high that very long-range
acoustic propagation would not be possible due to
dissipation. However, it may be useful in the con-
text of short range acoustic experiments using much
higher frequencies to establish a cross-over frequency
with a more realistic model.

Ray methods are sensitive to inﬁnitely ﬁne scale
structures. Those ﬁne structures that are not de-
tectable by the wave propagation lead to physically
irrelevant micro-folds in the phase space manifolds
for the rays. These folds lead to unwanted singu-
larities and the breakdown of semiclassical approx-
imations. Smoothing of the internal wave sound
speed model allows a signiﬁcant reduction in the ex-
tent of micro-folding and this must lead to a better
ray/wave correspondence. However, the smoothing
does not, in general, eliminate the problems associ-
ated with ray chaos. The Lyapunov exponents are
positive and signiﬁcant unless the smoothing scale
exceeds, 300
500 m. Thus, in this simpliﬁed model,
ray chaos continues to be an important issue for
source frequencies above the 15
25 Hz range. This
seems to be consistent with the stability noted (or
lack thereof) in experiments carried out over a range

−

−

of frequencies.

A number of questions of

interest remain or
emerge from our results. Our computations did not
use pulsed sources, which can be expressed as an
integral over a range of frequencies. It would seem
reasonable to assume that the dynamics should be
smoothed less for higher frequencies than for appre-
ciably lower frequencies. How much attention must
be paid to this issue? Can one make the crude ap-
proximation of using smoothing for the center fre-
quency of a pulse?

In pulsed experiments, the early arrivals form
branches which correspond to wave energy propa-
gating at the larger angles near θmax. Depending on
the range of propagation, the late arrival portion of
the signal may be constrained to a narrower range of
propagation angles. Is more smoothing appropriate
for this portion due to the θmax factor in λmin?

The ﬁdelity measures introduced in the ocean
sound transmission context here are quite generally
a function of range. Yet, we mainly used 1000 km
propagation in our calculations to determine the op-
timal amount of smoothing and neglected the range
dependence; we did note however a weak range de-
pendence. How can the issue of range dependence
be treated self-consistently when several range de-
pendent assumptions have already been made. Re-
call that several approximations are made arriving
at the parabolic equation or other one-way, small-
angle approximation variants. The neglected terms
may also put range dependence in the propagation,
and it would not make sense to try to be more accu-
rate with the smoothing than the level of these other
approximations. A more detailed understanding of
the eﬀects of neglected terms would be desirable.

Although, there is signiﬁcantly less micro-folding
for the smoothed than for the unsmoothed poten-
tials, there is still uncertainty as to how much im-
provement is gained for the optimal smoothing. This
could be made clear by carrying out the full detailed
semiclassical construction and comparing it to the
wave ﬁeld propagation. We intend to address this in
a future work. Only by separating out the issue of
physically irrelevant ﬁne structures can we begin to
fully address the ray chaos conundrum and see if it
can be overcome.

FAST FOURIER TRANSFORM METHOD

proper convergence of the split-operator method for
the propagation.

The parabolic equation in Eq. (4) describes the
propagation of an acoustic wave with Hamiltonian
H = p2/2 + V , where p2/2 and V denote the kinetic
and potential energies. A wave ﬁeld can be advanced
exactly through the application of the unitary
Hdr). The split-
propagation operator exp(

The wave ﬁelds in this paper are calculated over
R
a vertical grid of z
2, 7] km. The reﬂection
[
−
boundary condition at the surface is not enforced in
favor of the wave experiencing a soft reﬂection from
the potential rather than a hard reﬂection from the
surface. Wave energy which is reﬂected from the
surface is eventually absorbed by the bottom in long
range propagations so that this energy is negligible
at a receiver. The soft reﬂections of the wave are
due only to the background portion of the potential
(Munk’s canonical model in Eq. (8)) whose eﬀects
have been extended above the surface, z < 0. The
internal wave ﬂuctuations from Eq. (9) are cut oﬀ
by the surface ﬁlter in Eq. (10) so that they don’t
have an eﬀect on the wave above the surface.

The grid size for the propagation is chosen to be
dependent on the source frequency (to ensure proper
sampling of the source in the horizontal and verti-
cal directions) and the maximum number of vertical
modes, J (to ensure proper sampling of the smallest
wavelengths in each vertical mode). The grid num-
ber in the depth direction is purposely chosen to be
a power of 2 to allow the use of a fast fourier trans-
form for the split-operator Fourier method. Specif-
ically, for the source frequencies 25, 75, 150, 250 Hz,
we chose ∆r = 0.01, 0.01, 0.005, 0.0025 km and ∆z =
9/N km where N = 1024, 2048, 2048, 2048, respec-
tively. These values are large enough to guarantee

A single random seed generates the random phases,
[0, 2π), for each internal wave with vertical
φj,kr ∈
mode, j, and horizontal wavenumber, kr. These ran-
dom phases give the ocean a diﬀerent internal wave
realization for each random seed. All calculations
in this paper were done with a single realization of
the internal wave ﬁeld, but all results are similar
for averages over ensemble of internal wave ﬁelds as
well. Each internal wave in the superposition has the
statistics of the Garrett-Munk spectrum. The full
Garrett-Munk energy of E = 6.3 x 10−5 has been
used in all calculations. Our calculations are done
for a latitude of 30◦ so that the inertial frequency
is fi = 1 cycle per day. The buoyancy proﬁle is
assumed to have the form N (z) = N0e−z/B, where
N0 = 1 cycle per 10 min is the buoyancy frequency at
the surface. We considered the depth of the ocean
to be H = 5.0 km, even though we extended the
2, 7] km for the
propagation range to the region [
reasons described in Appendix A.

The particular functional

forms and constants
used in this paper are as used by Colosi and Brown.
Some of these forms and constants have already been
identiﬁed in the body of the paper (i.e. near Eq. (9)),
while the others are listed here. We took the gravita-
tional acceleration g = 9.81 m/s2, M = (πj∗
1)/2j2
∗
and the principle mode number j∗ = 3. We took 512
horizontal internal wavenumbers equally spaced by
2π[0.01, 1.0] cycles per km. In the ex-
∆kr for kr ∈
pression for Ij,kr , we took kj = fiπj/N0B and the
ratio β = kr/kj.

Aggregation of ie rystals is a key proess gov-

erning preipitation. Individual ie rystals ex-

hibit onsiderable diversity of shape, and a wide

range of physial proesses ould in(cid:29)uene their

aggregation; despite this we show that a simple

omputer model aptures key features of aggre-

gate shape [1℄ and size distribution [2℄ measured

from Cirrus louds. The results prompt a new

way to plot the experimental size distributions

leading to remarkably good dynamial saling.

That saling independently on(cid:28)rms that there is

a single dominant aggregation mehanism at play,

albeit our model (based on unde(cid:29)eted tra jeto-

ries to ontat) does not apture its form exatly.

It has reently beome possible to ollet large sam-

ples of high resolution loud partile images in real time,

opening up the modelling of loud dynamis to detailed

omparison with nature. Figure 1 shows ie rystal ag-

gregates from a Cirrus loud over the USA, aptured by

non-ontat airraft-based imaging; these aggregates an

be seen to be omprised of varied rosette ie rystal types.

Suh aggregation is a key feature of loud development

in the troposphere and an be quite ruial to the devel-

opment of preipitation, whether it reahes the ground

as snow or melts (cid:28)rst to arrive as rain.

down to small redued sizes looks good. Indeed it looks so

good that the transient (cid:29)attening around ℓ/L ≈ 1 whih

is absent from the simulations appears to be signi(cid:28)ant.

One suggestion for the (cid:29)attening around the middle of

the resaled distribution is that it might be assoiated

with the peuliar feature of the ollision rate being zero

between lusters of equal sedimentation speed. However

our simulations inlude this feature. Another possibil-

ity is hydrodynami details whih our simulations ignore:

small lusters an be swept around larger ones, and they

an also be sub jet to wake apture. This remains un-

solved.

We appear to have a fairly omplete understanding of

the geometry of the atmospheri ie rystal aggregates,

dominated by stiking upon enounter. Further details

of the stiking mehanism (whih we did not inlude) ap-

pear not to be important for the luster geometry, and

the exellent saling superposition of the experimental

luster size distributions suggests stiking e(cid:30)ieny does

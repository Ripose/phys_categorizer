Year-ahead prediction of US landfalling hurricane numbers

Abstract

We present a simple method for the year-ahead prediction of the number of hurricanes making
landfall in the US. The method is based on averages of historical annual hurricane numbers, and we
perform a backtesting study to ﬁnd the length of averaging window that would have given the best
predictions in the past.

1 Introduction

We are interested in developing more accurate methods for the prediction of the number of hurricanes
making landfall in the US during the North Atlantic hurricane season. This question is of relevance to
the many diﬀerent groups of people who feel the eﬀects of hurricanes, such as homeowners, businesses,
government and the insurance industry. Accurate predictions, even if they are not highly accurate, can
help such groups to make eﬃcient use of resources for protecting against the adverse eﬀects of hurricanes.
A number of articles have presented methods for the prediction of the number of Atlantic-basin hurricanes,
such as Blake and Gray (2004), Elsner and Schmertmann (1993), Elsner and Jagger (2004), Gray (1993),
Gray (1994) and Klotzbach and Gray (2003), while others have focussed on the prediction of the number
of landfalling hurricanes, such as Saunders and Lea (2005). These studies all considered the question of
how to predict the number of hurricanes from a point in time either a few months before the start of, or
during, the hurricane season. For instance in Gray (1993) predictions were made from August 1, in Gray
(1994) predictions were made from June 1, and in Saunders and Lea (2005) predictions were made from
August 1. These kinds of predictions are usually known as seasonal predictions, since they forecast
roughly a season in advance. We, however, will consider predictions from a point in time several months
earlier than this, at the end of the previous year’s hurricane season. For some applications, particularly in
the insurance industry, predictions for this longer lead time are more relevant than seasonal predictions.
Such year-ahead predictions, as we call them (following Jewson and Brix (2004)), as well as being useful
in their own right, also serve as an important baseline against which seasonal predictions should be
compared. Long term historical averages are not a reasonable baseline for comparison since they are
rather easy to beat even without a complex seasonal prediction scheme, as we shall see below.
We take the idea of making year-ahead meteorological predictions from the weather derivatives industry,
where such predictions are an essential part of the pricing of weather derivatives contracts (see, for
example Jewson et al. (2005)). We will also take the forecasting method that we present from that
industry. The method is a very simple statistical scheme that uses the observed time series of annual
historical hurricane numbers to predict future values.
Meteorologists often use the word ‘climatology’ to refer to the unconditional statistics of the climate,
and one could refer to the predictions that we describe below as being methods for estimating the clima-
tological mean i.e. as methods for estimating the expected number of landfalling hurricanes before any
dynamical forecasts become available. The concept of time-independent climatology, however, although
sometimes useful at a theoretical or conceptual level, breaks down when one considers real meteorological
observations. No meteorological time series are stationary, and every sensible estimate of likely future
observations is always conditioned on past observations in some way. We therefore prefer to think of all
statements of likely future values of weather variables as predictions of one sort or another, rather than
as estimation of climatology.

In section 2 we describe the data on which this study is based, in section 3 we describe the statistical
method that we will use, in section 4 we present our results and in section 5 we discuss these results and
mention some directions for future research.

The data we use for this study is the HURDAT data-base1, that lists Atlantic hurricane occurences
from the late nineteenth century up to the present. We will only use information about the number of
hurricanes making landfall in the US (a variable known as ‘xing’ in the database), and then only from
1900 onwards. The data for landfalling hurricanes for the period from 1900 to the present is generally
believed to be reasonably accurate (see, for example, the discussion on data quality in Elsner and Kara
(1999)). In fact, our main test will only use data from 1940 to 2004, while our sensitivity tests include
the (perhaps slightly less reliable) data from 1900 to 1939.

2 Data

3 Method

The method we will use to predict lanfalling hurricane numbers is simple in the extreme: we predict the
number of landfalling hurricanes in year i as the average of the numbers of landfalling hurricanes per
year over the n previous years (years i − 1, ..., i − n). To calibrate the method we then use backtesting
(also sometimes known as hindcasting) to see which value of n would have worked best in the past (over
the period 1940-2004). To make a forecast from our model we assume that the dynamics of the time
series have remained constant (i.e. that the values of n that worked well in the past will work well in
the future) and so we use the optimal value of n to predict the number of hurricanes for next year.
Our predictions are point predictions (i.e. single values): they can be taken either as a prediction of
the number of hurricanes or as an estimate of the expected number of hurricanes. In either case, the
prediction is designed to minimise root mean square error (RMSE).
If we believed that the time series of hurricane numbers were stationary then we would expect the optimal
value of n to be the largest possible given the available data. The use of such large values of n appears to
be quite common. For instance, many of the authors who make seasonal forecasts have compared their
forecasts with forecasts made from such long term averages. Also, the Florida Commission on Hurricane
Loss Projection Methodology (FCHLPM, a regulatory body that oversees the commercial risk modelling
ﬁrms that advise the insurance industry on hurricane risk) also seems to suggest that such a long term
average should be used to evaluate that risk. 2.
However, there is abundant evidence that the landfalling hurricane number time series (as shown in ﬁg-
ure 1) is not stationary. Firstly, it doesn’t look stationary: there appear to be long time-scale ﬂuctuations
from decade to decade. For example, the 1950’s saw lots of landfalls, the 1970’s and 1980’s relatively few.
Secondly, there are good physical reasons to think that it isn’t stationary. One is that ENSO state has
an impact on hurricane numbers, and ENSO state ﬂuctuates from year to year and decade to decade.
Another is that decadal time-scale ﬂuctuations in Atlantic sea surface temperatures probably have an
impact on hurricane numbers (see, for example, the discussion on this in Gray et al. (1997)).
It therefore makes sense to consider values of n which are less than the longest possible, and testing such
lower values of n is the goal of this study. A priori we expect that lower values will probably beat higher
values of n because of the non-stationarity of the series. However, the optimal value of n would be very
hard to determine from physical principles since it depends in a complex way on the frequencies and
amplitudes of the ‘signal’ and the ‘noise’ in the hurricane number time series. However much physical
understanding we have of the processes governing hurricane formation it seems likely that it will only
ever be possible to determine the optimal n empirically.

4 Results

The results of our backtesting evaluation of diﬀerent values of n are shown in ﬁgure 2. These results are
based on data from 1940 to 2004, and show the MSE from all possible year-ahead hindcasts that one
can make using this data set, for each value of n. The smaller the value of n the more predictive tests
are possible, and hence the more terms in the sum that makes up the MSE. Presumably the values of
MSE for small n are thus better estimated than those for large n. The MSE values for small n are also

1see http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat
2see http://www.sbafla.com/

based on predictions over a wider range of years, while results for large n are necessarily based only on
predictions of more recent data.
In addition to showing MSE (stars) we also show the break-down of MSE into the standard deviation
(SD) (solid line) and the bias (circles).
Considering the MSE results, we see that the lowest MSE values are given using a window length of 6
years. Similarly low values of MSE are attained from window lengths either side of 6 years: values of n
from 3 years to 21 years all give MSE scores lower than 2.1. The worst results come from the longest
window length tested, of 64 years. The breakdown of MSE into SD and bias shows that, except at the
highest values of n, the MSE is dominated by the SD.
We could, at this point, conclude that optimal forecasts of future hurricane numbers should be made
using a window of length 6 years, and move on. However, there are three questions which deserve more
investigation. The ﬁrst is whether it makes much diﬀerence to the forecasts generated what length of
averaging window is used, the second is whether the minimum at 6 years could have occurred by chance
even in a random stationary time series, and the third, given that the minimum of MSE is not particularly
sharp, is to investigate the sensitivity of the results to the number of years used in the analysis.
With respect to the ﬁrst of these questions, ﬁgure 3 shows hindcasts produced using an averaging window
of length 6 years, along with actual hurricane numbers and the long term average. We see that the
hindcasts produced from the 6 year averaging window ﬂuctuate to a great degree, from values from near
to 3 hurricanes per year in the years around 1950, to values below 1 hurricane per year in the late 1970s.
There is a clear interdecadal time-scale in these ﬂuctuations. Recent forecasts predict values just above
2, and are above the long-term average. We conclude from this that it does matter what method is used
for year-ahead prediction of hurricane numbers, since 6 year averaging and long-term averaging give very
diﬀerent results.
With respect to the second of these questions (whether the minimum at 6 years could have occurred by
chance) we perform a simple statistical test as follows. We randomly shuﬄe the hurricane number time
series 2,000 times, thus producing 2,000 new time series with the same marginal distribution but diﬀerent
ordering. We then repeat the backtesting analysis to ﬁnd the optimal window length for each of these
reshuﬄed time series. This gives us 2,000 values of the optimal window length. We compare the optimal
window length for the real series (6 years) against the distribution of optimal window lengths deﬁned by
these 2,000 values. The distribution of the 2,000 optimal window lengths is shown in ﬁgure 4. We see
that this distribution has most of the mass at much longer window lengths than 6 years. In fact, there
are only 2 values below 6 years. We can thus calculate a p value of 2/2,000=0.1% for this statistical test.
How should we interpret this result? It seems to be strong statistical evidence that the observed time
series is genuinely not stationary: if it were then we would expect the optimal window length for the real
series to be much longer than 6 years.
To address the third question, of the sensitivity of the value for the optimal window length versus the
number of years of data used, we perform two further tests. First, we repeat the backtesting analysis
using data from 1900 to 2004. As expected, given the short and noisy data series with which we are
working, the exact length of the optimal window length changes: it is now 20 years rather than 6. We
also repeat the statistical test: this time 40 cases give values below 20 years. This is less statistically
signiﬁcant than previously (the new p-value is 40/2000=2%), but nevertheless conﬁrms the general result
that using short rather than long windows gives lower values of MSE.
Secondly we repeat the backtesting analysis using all possible starting points between (and including)
1900 and 1940. This gives us 41 backtesting experiments. In each case we calculate the optimal window
length, giving us 41 optimal window lengths. The distribution of these 41 values are shown in ﬁgure 7.
We see a range of window lengths, from 6 to 28. The result for the 1940-2004 data, giving a window of
length 6, is at one extreme end of the range. However, in combination with the histograms in ﬁgures 3
and 5 we again see clearly that short window lengths (now in the range 6 to 28 years) are better than
longer window lengths.

5 Discussion

We have performed a simple investigation into how to forecast landfalling hurricane numbers nearly a
year in advance using time averages of the observed hurricane number time series. In accordance with
expectations, shorter averaging windows (of lengths 6 to 28 years) perform better than longer averaging
windows (of length more than 28 years). This is presumably because the hurricane number time series
is not stationary, but shows long time-scale variations, and short averaging windows capture information
about the current phase of these variations.

A statistical test based on reordering of the observations shows that the short optimal window lengths
that we derive would be extremely unlikely to have occurred by chance in a stationary random time series
with the same marginal distribution as the observations. And sensitivity tests show that our results are
not dependent on the exact period of historical data used for the analysis.
Our method allows for the hurricane number time series to be non-stationary, but assumes that the
dynamics are constant (in the sense that we assume that predictions that have worked well in the past
will work well in the future). To the extent that the dynamics is really changing (perhaps due to
increases in the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide) our results may not be terribly meaningful.
But then no other analysis of historical hurricane numbers would be meaningful either, and we would be
in a position where we could say almost nothing about the future.
This is our ﬁrst foray into the question of how to predict hurricane numbers. But there are a number of
directions in which we intend to continue this research, including:

• Testing schemes that model the interdecadal cycle in hurricane numbers using a trend model rather

than just a ﬂat-line

• Applying the methodology used above to model numbers of hurricanes in the whole North Atlantic
basin, numbers of hurricanes in diﬀerent parts of the basin, the proportion of hurricanes making
landfall, weak and strong hurricanes, tropical storms in other basins, and so on.

• Extending the method to include a ‘detrending’ element, in which we calculate optimal estimates
of the long time scale ﬂuctuations that are presumably the source of the year-ahead predictability
that we have detected

• Applying the methodology to other important climate time series, such as the NAO.

In this study we have considered point (single value) predictions of the number of hurricanes. However, for
many applications, predictions of the whole distribution of the possible number of landfalling hurricanes
would be more useful. To this end, we also intend to extend the methodology to predict this distribution.
Finally we note that one of the loose ends from this study is that we have only pinned down the optimal
window length to lie within a range from 6 to 28 years. A method that merges predictions from diﬀerent
window lengths (perhaps using likelihood-weighted model averaging) might be a reasonable way to im-
prove our simple prediction methodology, and would avoid having to make an arbitrary choice of window
length from within this range of values.

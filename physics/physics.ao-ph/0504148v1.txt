Abstract

The topographical scattering of gravity waves is investigated using a spectral
energy balance equation that accounts for ﬁrst order wave-bottom Bragg scat-
tering. This model represents the bottom topography and surface waves with
spectra, and evaluates a Bragg scattering source term that is theoretically valid
for small bottom and surface slopes and slowly varying spectral properties. The
robustness of the model is tested for a variety of topographies uniform along one
horizontal dimension including nearly sinusoidal, linear ramp and step proﬁles.
Results are compared with reﬂections computed using an accurate method that
applies integral matching along vertical boundaries of a series of steps. For small
bottom amplitudes, the source term representation yields accurate reﬂection es-
timates even for a localized scatterer. This result is proved for small bottom
amplitudes h relative to the mean water depth H. Wave reﬂection by small
amplitude bottom topography thus depends primarily on the bottom elevation
variance at the Bragg resonance scales, and is insensitive to the detailed shape
of the bottom proﬁle. Relative errors in the energy reﬂection coeﬃcient are
found to be typically 2h/H.

INTRODUCTION

Wave propagation over any bottom topography can now be predicted with
boundary element methods or other accurate numerical techniques. However,
wave forecasting relies to a large extent on phase-averaged spectral wave models
based on the energy or action balance equation (Gelci et al. 1957) . For large
bottom slopes waves can be reﬂected and this reﬂection is currently not repre-
sented in these models, while the signiﬁcance of this process is still poorly known
(Long 1973; Richter et al. 1976; Ardhuin et al. 2003). For waves propagating
over a sinusoidal seabed proﬁle, a maximum reﬂection or resonance is observed
when the seabed wavenumber is twice as large as the surface wave wavenumber
(Heathershaw 1982). Davies and Heathershaw (1984) proposed a deterministic
wave amplitude evolution equation for normally incident waves over a sinusoidal
seabed, based on a perturbation expansion for small bottom undulations. This
theory was shown to be in good agreement with experimental data but overes-
timates reﬂection at resonance. Mei (1985) developed a more accurate approx-
imation that is valid at resonance using a multiple scale theory. This approach
was further extended to random bottom topography in one dimension (Mei and
Hancock, 2003). The Bragg resonance theory can be extended to any arbi-
trary topography in two dimensions, that is statistically uniform(Hasselmann
1966). Ardhuin and Herbers (2002) further included slow depth variations.
The resulting spectral energy balance equation contains a bottom scattering
source term Sbscat, which is formally valid for small surface and bottom slopes
and slowly varying spectral properties. Sbscat is readily introduced into exist-
ing energy-balance-based spectral wave models, and was numerically validated
with ﬁeld observations (Ardhuin et al. 2003). While this stochastic theory is
in a good agreement with deterministic results for small amplitude sinusoidal
topography (Ardhuin and Herbers 2002), the assumed slowly varying bottom
spectrum is not compatible with isolated bottom features, and the limitations
and robustness of the source term approximation for realistic continental shelf
topography are not well understood. The limitations of the stochastic source
term model are examined here through comparisons with a deterministic model
for arbitrary one-dimensional (1D) seabed topography that is uniform along the
second horizontal dimension. We review the random Bragg scattering model,
and investigate the applicability limits of the source term for a variety of seabed
topography. Predicted reﬂection coeﬃcients are compared with results based on
Rey’s (1992) model, which approximates the bottom proﬁle as a series of steps.
Examples include modulated sinusoidal topography that is well within the va-
lidity constraints of the source term approximation as well as a steep ramp and
a step that violate the assumption of a slowly varying bottom spectrum and
thus provide a simple test of the robustness of the source term approximation.

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

MATCHING BOUNDARY SOLUTION

We use Rey’s (1992) algorithm, based on the theory of Takano (1960) and Kirby
and Dalrymple (1982). It uses a decomposition of the bottom proﬁle in a series
of N steps with integral matching along vertical boundaries between each pair of
adjacent steps. A coordinate frame is deﬁned with the horizontal x coordinate
in the direction of the incident waves and the vertical z coordinate pointing
upwards relative to the mean water level. The velocity potential is described
by a sum of ﬂat bottom propagating and evanescent modes. Evanescent modes
are included in the matching condition to ensure a consistent treatment of the
wave ﬁeld (Rey 1992). The general solution of the velocity potential for a step
(p) of depth Hp is given by the following equations:

Φp(x, z, t) = φp(x, z)e−iwt

The orthogonality of the set functions largely simpliﬁes these equations. In
order to solve the problem numerically, the number of evanescent modes q are
truncated to q = Q. Practically, only a few evanescent modes are needed to
ensure convergence. For N steps, 2N (Q + 1) equations are solved to obtain
the 2N (Q + 1) complex coeﬃcients A±
p,q. At the boundaries (p=0 and

varying mean depth H and small-scale topography h. The bottom elevation is
H(x) + h(x), with x the horizontal position vector. The free

Assuming that the surface and the small-scale bottom slopes are of the same

of φ up to the third order in ε yields the following spectral energy balance

REFLECTION BY MODULATED SINUSOIDAL
BOTTOM TOPOGRAPHY

The source term approximation was validated by Ardhuin and Herbers (2002)
for random waves reﬂecting from a sinusoidal seabed, by integrating Sbscat an-
k) <<
alytically across the wave spectrum in the limit of weak reﬂection (E(
E(k) , with positive and negative wavenumbers corresponding to the incident
and reﬂected waves, respectively). A comparison with Dalrymple and Kirby’s
(1986) solution gave good agreement, even for only a few bars. For stronger
reﬂection, equation (24) is not readily evaluated analytically, and numerical
integration is not feasible since a sinusoidal bottom has an inﬁnitely narrow
spectrum (a Dirac distribution), and thus cannot be represented with a ﬁnite
bottom discretization ∆kb.

Figure 3: Modulated seabed (m=3), bkb,0 = 0.06

We consider instead a bottom spectrum with a ﬁnite width that corresponds

to a modulated sinusoidal bottom proﬁle.

The modulated seabed is represented by a sum of cosines:

h(x) = Σi=(m−1)/2

i=−(m−1)/2bicos[(kb,0 + i∆kb)x]

(28)

The slowly varying depth (H), deﬁned in part 2 is taken constant while the per-
turbation (h) represents the modulated seabed. We deﬁne the root mean square
(r.m.s.) bar amplitude b from the bottom variance, b = √< h2 >, and a repre-
sentative bottom slope ε = bkb,0. The reﬂected wave energy is calculated for the
bed proﬁle shown in ﬁgure 3, with the peak bottom wave number kb,0 = 6m−1
(λb,0 = 1.04m), and a short modulation length with m = 3, and equal ampli-
tudes (bi) for all bottom components. The length of the bed is 1.5 modulation
lengths, giving the bottom spectrum shown in ﬁgure 4. The reﬂection from this
modulated sinusoidal bottom was evaluated for an incident Pierson-Moskowitz
spectrum, with a peak at k0 satisfying the Bragg resonance condition 2k0 = kb,0
(Fig.5). Spectral results for Rey’s model were obtained by evaluating reﬂection
coeﬃcients for monochromatic waves over a range of frequencies and integrat-
ing the reﬂected energy across the spectrum. 70 steps are used to resolved the
bathymetry. Results for various values of b are displayed in the form of reﬂection
coeﬃcients R (Fig.6) as a function of the slope bkb,0. R is deﬁned by the ratio of
the reﬂected and incident energies: R = (Σk<0E)/ (Σk>0E). Predictions based
on the source term method (RSmod) and the matching boundary model using
5 evanescent modes (RMBmod) agree well over a wide range of bottom slopes.
The solutions gradually diverge for large bottom slopes where the source term
underpredicts the reﬂection. Even for bk0 = 0.3 (b/λ0 = 0.05), diﬀerences are

To evaluate the eﬀect of the spectral width on the reﬂection coeﬃcient, ﬁg-
ure 6 also includes predictions for sinusoidal topography (m=0) with the same
variance. Results for sinusoidal topography were obtained using Mei’s (1985)
analytical approximation and Rey’s (1992) algorithm. The resulting reﬂection
coeﬃcients RMei and RMBsin, respectively, agree for small bottom slopes (Fig.6)
and diverge for larger slopes as already shown by Rey (1992). Indeed, RMei was
derived for small bottom slopes while the matched boundary solution converges
to the exact reﬂection for any bottom proﬁle when the number of evanescent
modes goes to inﬁnity. What may seem surprising is that the reﬂection coef-
ﬁcient for the sinusoidal and modulated sinusoidal topographies RMBmod and
RMBsin agree for small slopes although bottom proﬁles are quite diﬀerent. Ap-
parently, for small bottom slopes and narrow bottom spectra the reﬂection is
only a function of the total bottom elevation variance b2 and does not depend
on the phases of its components. This result is obvious from the viewpoint of
the source term theory that was derived for small bottom slopes, and does not
retain the phases of the bottom spectrum components. The predicted reﬂection
depends on the convolution of the wave spectrum with the bottom spectrum at
the Bragg resonance wavenumber (the integral of (25) over all wavenumbers).
If the bottom spectrum is narrow compared with the wave spectrum then the
total source term depends only on the total bottom variance and the surface
spectral density at the Bragg resonance wavenumber.

REFLECTION BY A LINEAR RAMP

To investigate the robustness of the variance-based source term model for re-
ﬂection induced by localized topography, we consider the linear ramp problem
used in previous studies to test the mild slope equation (Booij 1983). In the
source term approximation, wave scattering is the result of interactions between
surface waves and bottom variations at the scale of the surface wavelength. The
scattering model is thus based on a decomposition of the topography into a
slowly varying depth H and a perturbation h (small scale topography), which
corresponds to a separation between refraction and shoaling that occurs over
the slowly varying depth H and scattering at these short scales. For practical
applications, it is desirable to have a perturbation h that is zero outside of a
ﬁnite region, so that the spectrum of h is well deﬁned. Once the two criteria
that the slope of H does not exceed a given threshold and h is zero outside of a
region of radius nL are satisﬁed, the choice of the depth decomposition in h and
H is fairly arbitrary and does not aﬀect the following results. For simplicity we
take a piecewise linear function for H(x), so that the perturbation h(x) takes
the form of a triangular wave (Fig.7).

The ramp proﬁle is deﬁned by the ﬁxed water depths H1, H2, while the ramp
slope α is varied by adjusting its length 2L (Fig.7). To ensure that H(x) is slowly
varying, γ has to be small. This is achieved by extending the domain to a length
2nL with n > 1 (Fig.7). The slope of H is then given by tan γ = (tan α)/n,
with several values of n tested below.

First test case: small depth change

We ﬁrst consider a ramp with a small depth transition from H1 = 0.5m to
H2 = 0.3m. The incident wave spectrum is represented by the same Pierson-
Moskowitz spectrum that was used in the previous section with the peak wavenum-
ber in deep water k0 = 3m−1 (Fig.5), so that k0H1 = 1.5 and k0H2 = 0.9. In
order to investigate the source term applicability limits, the linear ramp slope
tan α is varied from 0.01 to 2.9. For each value of α, several values of γ are tested,
with n varying from 5 to 50. The reﬂection coeﬃcient RS (source term reﬂection
due to the residual) is compared with the ”exact” computation RMB (matching
RMB)/RMB is shown
boundary algorithm) in ﬁgure 8 and the relative error (RS −
in ﬁgure 9. In our calculations, for slopes of H such as tan α < 0.4, RS,n=5 is
within 30% of the exact value RMB. For larger values of tan α, RS,n=5 decreases
and tends to zero (Fig.8), while the exact solution RMB converges to the re-
ﬂection over a vertical step as tan α goes to inﬁnity. The value tan α = 0.4
corresponds to tan γ (= tan α/5) equal to 0.08. For larger n the slope of H is
reduced and RS,n is valid for a wider range of ramp slopes.

We notice that for all values of n shown in ﬁgure 8, the model gives reasonable
results for tan γ (= (tan α)/n) up to about 0.08. The ramp slope does not
appear to be a limiting factor (as it was assumed in the theory). For tan γ
larger than 0.08 the reﬂection is increasingly underestimated probably because
of the contribution of the large scale proﬁle H(x) to the reﬂection. As n increases
h approaches the slope of the actual ramp and RS,n converges to RS,∞ which
is about 10% larger than RMB for all ramp slopes. As discussed below, the
accuracy of the model is apparently not limited by the ramp slope.

H (dashed line) and residual h (dotted line). (a) and (b) for small and large n
respectively

It may seem surprising that RS,n actually converges for large n while the
bottom spectrum does not.
In the case of a vertical step of height h in the
middle of a domain of length 2nL, the spectral density F B(k) of a discrete
variance spectrum of the residual is proportional to h2/2nLk2 and tends to
zero (except around k = 0) as n goes to inﬁnity. However the source term
formulation represents scattering as uniformly distributed along the bottom,
and the integration of the source term along the wave propagation path yields
a reﬂection that is proportional to 2nL F B(k) and thus converges when n goes
to inﬁnity. The use of inﬁnite support for H and h (taking the limit n
) to
compute the reﬂection over a localized ramp is counterintuitive. It represents
a physically localized scattering with a mathematically distributed source. In
practice, the bottom spectrum is obtained by discrete Fourier Transform of the
bottom, and it only tends to continuous power spectrum in the limit n
.
→ ∞
Further, it should be realized that the bottom power spectrum is the Fourier
transform of the bottom autocorellation function used by Mei and Hancock
(2003, see Appendix).

For a non-random bottom such as the ramp here, one may use intermediate
results by Mei and Hancock (2003) where the hypothesis that the bottom is
random only comes in for discarding nonlinear wave eﬀects (which are not taken

is justiﬁed by the convergence of the discrete spectrum
to the continuous power spectrum and the theory of Mei and Hancock (2003)
It shows that the far ﬁeld

scattered energy by small amplitude depth variations only depends on the power
spectrum of the scatterers at the Bragg scale, and not on its localization in space,
as long as the bottom amplitude remains small.

Booij’s ramp: larger depth change

This approach should clearly break down for ﬁnite bottom amplitudes, in partic-
ular because sub-harmonic scattering was observed (Belzons et al. 1991) while
it is not explained by the present theory. Such a limit should be tested to see
whether our present approach has some practical applicability. We therefore
take a second test case with a larger ramp is taken from Booij (1983) with
water depths H1 = 4.97m, H2 = 14.92m and an incident wave peak period
T = 10s. The corresponding peak wavenumber in deep water k0 = 0.04m−1 so
that k0H1 = 0.6 and k0H2 = 0.2. Results for ramp slopes tan α ranging from
0.001 to 2.9, and n=10 and 50 are shown in ﬁgure 10.

We notice again that RS,n converges for large n, provided that (tan α)/n <
0.08. However, in this case the relative error is larger than in the ﬁrst test case,
up to about 30%. The two tests have the same ramp slopes but diﬀerent ratio of
water depths at the edges of the ramp H1/H2 = 3 here versus H1/H2 = 1.7 in
the previous case. The two cases suggest that the source term is more sensitive

where ˜z = k0z, η = k0h, η corresponding to the scales that cause wave scat-
tering. The validity of the Taylor expansion requires that η is small and also
that the ﬁrst and second derivative of ˜φ with respect to ˜z are of order 1. In
this approximation (30) is limited by the small-scale slope k0h. However one
may also take H0 as the representative length which leads to the same equation
(30) with η = h/H0, limited then by the water depth ratio h/H0. The choice
of the representative length was arbitrary and can be justiﬁed only a posteriori,
by evaluating the scale of variation of Φ and thus the magnitude of ∂ ˜Φ/∂ ˜z and
∂2 ˜Φ/∂ ˜z2. The numerical results presented here show that the source term is
more sensitive to the water depth change h/H0 than the small-scale slope k0h.
Booij (1983) had found that the standard mild slope equation (Berkhoﬀ 1972)
gave errors less than 10% for tan α up to 1/3. Our results suggest that the Bragg
scattering model can be as accurate as the mild slope equation for computing
reﬂection, but only for ∆h/H0 less than 0.2.

REFLECTION BY A STEP

Now that the eﬀect of h/H0 is well established, one may question the importance
of other parameters. We thus evaluate source term predictions of broad and
narrow surface wave spectra over steps of varying height to gain further insight
into the limitations of the source term approximation for localized topography.
Reﬂection of waves by a rectangular step has been investigated analytically
and experimentally in numerous studies (Neuman 1965a,b; Miles 1967; Mei
and Black 1969; Mei 1983 and Rey, Belzons and Guazzelli 1992) and is well
understood. The step is deﬁned in ﬁgure 11, where 2L is the step-length, h the
height and 2nL the size of the entire computational domain.

Numerical set-up

The spectral density of the bottom F B(k) is proportional to h2/2nLk2. Hence,
integration of the source term along the wave propagation path yields a reﬂection
h2/k2, independent of n. Although the
that is proportional to 2nLF B(k)
domain length has no eﬀect on real waves in the absence of bottom friction, it
inﬂuences the discretization of the bottom spectrum (∆k = 2π/2nL), and thus
it may have an impact on the numerical results. However 2nF B(n) converges
as n goes to inﬁnity (Fig.12), so that the domain length does not change the
results for large enough values of n. A large domain with n = 8 was used here.

Figure 12: Wide and narrow surface wave spectra superposed on the bottom
spectrum for domain sizes n = 2, 6 and 8. The bottom spectrum is rescaled by
the surface wavenumber (F B(k/2)) to show the resonant bottom and surface
components.

The step width (2L) is taken to be half the wavelength of the surface waves
for a spectrum peak k0p = 0.04m−1 (L0 = 157m) in a water depth of 15m. Two
diﬀerent wave spectra are used here (bold lines in ﬁgure 12): a wide spectrum
(solid) with a classic Pierson-Moskowitz shape, typical of wind seas, and the
narrow swell-like spectrum (dashed) with a Gaussian shape. Once the shape
of wave spectrum is chosen, the solution is a function of three non-dimensional
variables: the step height h/H, the water depth k0pH, and the relative step
width k0pL.

Inﬂuence of the height of the step

The accuracy of the source term for a range of non-dimensional step heights h/H
is evaluated in intermediate and shallow water through comparison with the

15

”exact” matching boundary algorithm (Fig.13). Energy reﬂection coeﬃcients
are compared for two diﬀerent water depths, k0pH = 0.1 and k0pH = 0.6,
representative of shallow and intermediate depths. The incident wave spectrum
has a Pierson-Moskowitz shape.

the matching boundary algorithm (full-line), for intermediate depth (k0pH =
0.6) and shallow water (k0pH = 0.1), and relative error of the source term.

As expected from previous calculations, the error in the source term increases
with the step amplitude h/H. For h/H < 0.05 the error in the predicted re-
ﬂection coeﬃcients is less than 10%. These results provide further conﬁrmation
that the height of the localized scatterer is a limiting factor for the source term
computation, but not its slope, which is inﬁnite here, and this result holds for
very shallow water.

Inﬂuence of the width of the step and the wave spectrum

Here we consider the dependence of the reﬂection coeﬃcient on the width of the
step and the width of the wave spectrum for a small amplitude step (h/H =
0.02) in shallow water (k0pH = 0.1). The non-dimensional step width k0pL is
varied, eﬀectively changing the position of the wave spectrum peak relative to
the bottom spectral peaks (see Fig.12). Results are shown in ﬁgures 14 and 15
for wide and narrow wave spectra, respectively.

The same computation is done for the narrow spectrum (Fig.15).
For both wide and narrow surface waves spectra, the source term yields ac-
curate results, and the errors do not appear to be sensitive to the width of the
step. Oscillations in the reﬂection coeﬃcient with varying kp0L represent an

interference phenomenon that has been described in numerous previous studies.
When a monochromatic incident wave runs up the leading edge of the step at
x =
L, it is partly reﬂected and partly transmitted. As the transmitted com-
ponent passes the rear edge of the step at x = L, it is again partially reﬂected
and partially transmitted. If the reﬂected waves originating from the front and
rear edges of the step are in phase we have a constructive interference which
ampliﬁes the reﬂection. Conversely, destructive interference occurs if the two
reﬂected wave trains are 180 degrees out of phase and cancel out, yielding zero
reﬂection. For long waves, maximum reﬂection occurs when sin2 2kp0L = 1 (Mei,
1983), where kp0 is the incident wave wave number. This condition is met when:

this is explained by the fact that in the limit of large step width kp0L the
wave spectrum is wider than the side lobes of the bottom spectrum (see Fig.12)

spectrum and the surface wave spectrum, and thus the reﬂection is insensitive
to bottom spectral details with scales ﬁner than the wave spectrum width.

CONCLUSIONS

Predictions of the scattering of surface waves by bottom topography based on a
spectral energy balance equation that includes a wave-bottom Bragg scattering
source term (Ardhuin and Herbers 2002) are compared with exact results based
on a matching boundary algorithm (Rey 1992). The source term yields accu-
rate reﬂection predictions for modulated sinusoidal topography.
In the limit
of small bottom amplitudes h compared to the water depth H, the two models
yield identical results, conﬁrming that the far-ﬁeld scattered wave is determined
entirely by the variance spectrum of the bottom and does not depend on the
phases of its components. This ﬁnding also holds for localized topography, a
result that can be justiﬁed by the approach of Mei and Hancock (2003) using
their intermediate results for non-random bottoms. In that case, the bottom
spectrum must be carefully calculated over a large enough domain in order to
resolve the important bottom scales. Using Discrete Fourier Transforms, one
may use an artiﬁcial gently sloping extension of the area covered by scatterers.
However, it is found that it also holds for very steep topography, such as a single
step, for a variety of water depths and wave spectrum shapes, as long as h < H
is small. In our calculations, relative errors in the energy reﬂection coeﬃcient
are found to be typically 2h/H, or h/H for the amplitude reﬂection coeﬃcient.

18

These results show that the Bragg scattering source term is a reasonably accu-
rate method for representing wave reﬂection in spectral wave models, for a wide
range of small amplitude bottom topographies found on continental shelves.
The source term approach is also very eﬃcient compared to the elliptic models
such as proposed by Athanassoulis and Belibassakis (1999). An extension of
the source term to higher order (e.g. following Liu and Yue 1998) may reduce
errors for larger values of h/H, that are shown here to be the limiting factor in
practical applications. Results for 1D bottom proﬁles are expected to hold for
practical 2D applications of the source term approximation.

APPENDIX. RECONCILIATION OF RANDOM
AND DETERMINISTIC WAVE THEORIES

Mei and Hancock (2003) considered the same problem of a wave train propa-
gating over an arbitrary topography of small amplitude h. In their scaling h
is small compared to the wavelength 2π/k, but, as discussed in this paper, the
scaling for the bottom perturbation could also be the mean water depth H.
These authors further assume that h is a random function that is stationary
with respect to the fast coordinate x, and introduce a slow coordinate x1 for
variations in the statistics of h. This two-scale approach is similar to that used
by Ardhuin and Herbers (2002). Mei and Hancock (2003) obtained an ampli-
tude evolution equation in which the topography acts as a linear damping with
a coeﬃcient βi given by their equation (B8) as

βi =

ω(kσ)2k(ˆγ(2k) + ˆγ(0))
4 cosh2 kH(ω2H/g + sinh2 kH)

,

(32)

where σ2(x1)γ is the auto-correlation function of the bottom topography, decom-
posed in a slowly-varying local variance σ2(x1) and a normalized auto-covariance
γ. ˆγ is the Fourier Transform of γ. Although Mei and Hancock’s (2003) result
does not conserve energy (which requires the introduction of higher order terms,
see Ardhuin and Herbers 2002), it is rather general as far as the bottom is con-
cerned. The essential diﬀerence with Ardhuin and Herbers (2002) is that there
is no need for a large number of bottom undulations to obtain an expression
for the scattering, and the ”number of undulations” is properly deﬁned by the
scale over which the auto-covariance goes to zero.

19

Naturally the two theories are consistent, and we can obtain from βi the
damping coeﬃcient βE for the energy, which is twice that for the wave amplitude
A since ∂(AA⋆)/∂t =
βEAA⋆, with A⋆ the complex conjugate of
A. Re-writing (32) one has,

2βiAA⋆ =

−

−

For a zero-mean stationary process the Fourier transform of the auto-covariance
function is simply 2π times the power spectral density F B (e. g. Priestley 1981,
theorem 4.8.1 p 211), so that, for F B(0) = 0, we get

βE =

2k3ωσ2(ˆγ(2k) + ˆγ(0))
sinh 2kH [2kH + sinh 2kH]

.

βE =

4πk3ωF B(2k)
sinh 2kH [2kH + sinh 2kH]

,

which is the linear part of the bottom scattering source term (25) in one dimen-
sion,

Sbscat(k) = βE (E(

k)

E(k)) .

−

−

Interestingly the hypothesis of randomness for h is not important for the
value of βi when averaged over the entire ﬁeld of scatterers (however, it does
impact the real part, i.e. the phase of the waves). Following Mei and Hancock’s
(2003) derivation, one may deﬁne a βi that is also a function of the fast coordi-
nate x using their equation (2.36), and in that case the derivation is identical,
replacing σ2(x1)γ by h(x)h(x
ξ), all the way to their equations (B1)–(B3).
Then one may deﬁne a mean value, which, in the case of a ﬁnite region with
scatterers between

nL and nL reads,

In this case γ is obviously real and even and we obtain their equation (B8) for
βi.

We have thus proved that in one dimension and in the limit of small bottom
amplitudes the scattering source term applies to non-random bottoms. In these
conditions, the linear part of the source term represents the damping of the
incident waves (and thus also the average scattered wave energy) averaged over
the area covered by scatterers.

Abstract

The adjoint of an ocean general circulation model is used as a
tool for investigating the causes of changes in ENSO SST indices.
We identify adjoint Kelvin and Rossby waves in the sensitivities to
sea level and wind stress at earlier times, which can be traced back
for more than a year through western and weak eastern boundary
reﬂections. Depending on the thermocline depth the ﬁrst and second
baroclinic modes are excited. The sensitivities to the heat ﬂux and
SST are local and decay in about a month.

The sensitivities to the ﬂuxes are converted into the inﬂuence of
SST using the adjoint of a statistical atmosphere model. Focusing on
SST perturbations in the index region itself, we recover, up to a scale
factor, the delayed oscillator concept.

1 Introduction

The ﬁrst description of many components of ENSO was given by Walker
(1923,1924). Bjerknes (1966) gave a physical mechanism that identiﬁed a
positive feedback loop. The next goal was the identiﬁcation of the mecha-
nisms behind the oscillations, i.e., the negative feedback that ends a warm
(or cold) episode, and if possible, to predict the changes 3–12 months ahead
of time. The last decade yielded much improved data from the TOGA-TAO
experiment and remote sensing, and modelling capabilities have increased
steadily.

These models span the range from a stochastically forced harmonic os-
cillator (Burgers, 1997) and canonical correlation analyses (Barnston and
Ropelewski, 1992) to coupled shallow-water models (e.g., Zebiak and Cane,
1987; Schopf and Suarez, 1988; Kleeman et al., 1995) and general circula-
tion models (Ji et al., 1996; Barnett et al., 1993). Several hypotheses for
the mechanisms that are important in the observed ENSO signal have been
proposed, and identiﬁed in relatively simple ocean-atmosphere models that
give rise to ENSO-like oscillations but can still be analysed analytically.

The standard paradigm of ENSO oscillations describe the phenomenon
as a delayed oscillator (Suarez and Schopf, 1988; Battisti and Hirst, 1989).
Consider SST anomalies in the eastern equatorial Paciﬁc. On short time
scales a positive anomaly will weaken the temperature diﬀerence with the
western Paciﬁc, and hence weaken the trade winds, which in turn diminishes
the amount of upwelling. The subsiding trade winds also generate Kelvin
waves that propagate to the east and deepen the thermocline there, levelling
oﬀ the wind-generated slope. Both eﬀects lead to even higher temperatures.
This classical positive feedback mechanism (Bjerknes, 1966) is kept in check
by non-linear eﬀects and by the eﬀect of an accompanying equatorial Rossby
wave, which reﬂects oﬀ the western coasts as a negative anomaly Kelvin wave
and hence gives a negative feedback some time δ later. The delayed oscillator
contains these three eﬀects as

with T some index of the SST in the eastern Paciﬁc, and a, b, c, δ > 0. The
T 3 term does not inﬂuence the period very much, but is the simplest way to
represent non-linear eﬀects that keep the oscillations bounded.

This relation has been diagnosed in many models of the tropical Paciﬁc,
and gives rise to oscillations with time scales comparable with the observed
ENSO record. Evidence for a version of this mechanism is present in nature
has been presented by Mantua and Battisti (1994); Kessler and McPhaden
(1995).

However, many other possible modes have been proposed to be active in
ENSO oscillations. The waves of the delayed oscillator can be summed in
a fast-wave limit to an eﬀective change in thermocline depth, leading to a
‘recharge’ formulation (Wyrtki, 1975; Jin, 1997). On the other hand, the
‘SST slow mode’ (Neelin, 1991) is a coupled ocean-atmosphere mode related
to the anomalous precipitation patterns of El-Ni˜no events. Also, atmospheric
events (westerly wind-burst, Madden-Julian oscillations) may be responsible
for driving ENSO oscillations (?). All these fall outside the scope of this
article, which focuses on the role of the ocean.

In this study we try to identify the delayed oscillator mechanism operating
in an ocean general circulation model. The approach we take is based on
the observation that most indicators for ENSO are highly correlated (which,
incidentally, frustrates the search for a second independent variable to set
up an oscillator). Most eﬀects can therefore be related to a single function,
say the NINO3 index of sea surface temperature in the eastern Paciﬁc, and
we rephrase the question to the cause of ENSO as the computation of the
sensitivity of this index to changes in the forcing ﬁelds or state of the ocean
at earlier times. For small deviations this question can be addressed with an
adjoint model, which can trace all inﬂuences on one scalar function back in
time.

We describe the HOPE OGCM in section 2, together with a statistical
atmosphere model that is used in some experiments. This ocean model de-
scribes ENSO reasonably well (section 2.3).
In section 3 we describe the
adjoint ocean model. Using this we search for the sensitivity of a NINO
index to forcing ﬁelds (heat ﬂux, wind stress) and state variables (sea level
height, temperature) in section 4. With the help of the adjoint statistical
atmosphere model we transform the sensitivities to ﬂuxes into sensitivities
to SST anomalies, which are then simpliﬁed into a description resembling the
delayed oscillator in section 5. Our conclusions are presented in section 6.
Two appendices contain technical details and validation runs of the adjoint
model.

2 Model Description

2.1 The ocean model

The ocean model used in this study is HOPE (The Hamburg Ocean Primitive
Equation Model, Wolﬀ et al., 1997). As we are mainly interested in ENSO we
use a domain that is limited to the Paciﬁc Ocean (120◦E–70◦W, 55◦S–67◦N).
The model has a 2.8◦ resolution, with the meridional resolution gradually

2

increased to 0.5◦ within the region 10◦N to 10◦S. There are 20 vertical levels
which are irregularly spaced in such a fashion that ten levels are placed in the
upper 300 meters. The model contains a realistic bottom topography. The
numerical scheme uses the Arakawa E-grid (Arakawa and Lamb, 1977) and
a two-hour time step. We use a 360-day year subdivided in 12 equal-length
months of 4 weeks each. There is no diurnal cycle.

A Newtonian relaxation is employed to restore the surface salinity within
the whole domain to the climatology of Levitus (1982) using a time constant
of 40 days. Otherwise, no explicit fresh water ﬂux is provided. Prognostic
variables are the three-dimensional ﬁelds of horizontal velocity, temperature
and salinity, and the sea surface elevation. Physical parametrizations in
HOPE include solar penetration below the surface. About 14% of the so-
lar radiation incident on the ocean surface is allowed to penetrate beneath
the 20 m surface layer of the model (Paulson and Simpson, 1977; Schneider
et al., 1996). The vertical mixing in HOPE is based on a Richardson-number
dependent formulation and a simple mixed layer scheme to represent the
eﬀects of wind stirring (see Latif et al. (1994) for details). Further details
about the model physics as well as the numerical scheme are given in the
HOPE documentation (Wolﬀ et al., 1997).

2.2 The atmosphere model

For most experiments in this paper we used prescribed heat ﬂux and wind
stress ﬁelds. These were generated with the ECHAM-3 atmosphere from
observed SST ﬁelds and stored as daily values. ECHAM-3 is the Hamburg
version of the European Centre operational weather forecasting model. It
is described in detail in two reports (Roeckner et al., 1992; DKRZ, 1992).
The SSTs were taken from a data set of the British Meteorological Oﬃce
(UKMO), which is referred to as the ‘GISST’ data set (Parker et al., 1994).
Additionally, we imposed a relaxation to observed SSTs of 40 Wm−2/K,
using a Newtonian formulation. This is required to compensate for model
drift, which produces systematic diﬀerences of the simulated SSTs compared
to the observed ones that were used to generate the atmospheric forcing with
the ECHAM-3 model.

A statistical atmosphere model similar to the one used by Barnett et al.
(1993) is used to convert the sensitivities of the ocean model to these ﬂuxes
into sensitivities to SST. This simple atmosphere model is essentially a re-
gression relationship: wind stress anomalies and surface heat ﬂux anomalies
are related to sea surface temperature anomalies. This dependence is al-
most instantaneous and non-local. It reproduces the large-scale response of
In particular, the Bjerknes
the atmosphere to large-scale SST anomalies.

3

positive feedback of reduced trade winds resulting from a reduced east-west
SST gradient is well-reproduced in this type of model. On the other hand,
smaller-scale atmospheric responses, such as the SST slow mode, are not
caught.

The regression matrix is derived from an integration of the atmospheric
general circulation model ECHAM-3 with prescribed observed global SSTs
during the period 1949 to 1990. The linear regression is done in an Empiri-
cal Orthogonal Function space, retaining the ﬁrst 10 EOFs of the anomalies,
which account for 63% and 49% of the ﬁeld variance in the SST and the at-
mospheric ﬁelds, respectively. The dominant modes of interannual variability
are found to be well captured by the EOF truncation. To compensate for
systematic deﬁciencies of the OGCM, its simulated SST anomaly is corrected
using another regression matrix based on the leading 10 EOFs of observed
and simulated SST anomaly. The latter are obtained by forcing the ocean
model by the wind stresses and surface heat ﬂuxes from the ECHAM-3 inte-
gration mentioned above.

Let the observed and simulated SST anomalies be denoted by Tobs(x, t)
and Tsim(x, t), respectively. The zonal and meridional wind stress anomalies
were pooled together with the surface heat ﬂux anomalies in one data set of
Fecham(x, t). The EOF expansions of
atmospheric ﬂux anomalies denoted by
the observed and simulated ﬁelds are

To compensate again for systematic diﬀerences between the observed

leading the atmospheric ﬁelds by one month.

2.3 ENSO simulated by HOPE

Next we establish whether the model used is in fact able to reproduce the
observed behaviour of ENSO. The ocean model was spun up from the Levitus
climatology for 30 years with climatological forcing. It was then integrated for
42 years starting in January 1949, using wind stress and surface heat ﬂuxes
from the ECHAM-3 atmosphere model integration described in section 2.2
as upper boundary conditions, including the 40 Wm−2 relaxation to observed
SST.

The spatial structure as well as the temporal evolution of observed and
simulated interannual SST anomalies in the Paciﬁc Ocean can be inferred
from the pattern of the ﬁrst EOF and the associated principal component
shown in Fig. 2. Overall, the anomaly structure is simulated reasonably well
by the HOPE model. There are, however, some diﬀerences to the observa-
tions. The simulated SST anomalies are too much equatorially conﬁned, and
they extend too far into the western Paciﬁc. The latter deﬁciency is related
to the too strong cold tongue which extends too far into the western Paciﬁc.
Hence, in addition to the average SST in the NINO3 region (5◦S–5◦N, 90◦W–
150◦W) we will use a slightly further western region (NINO3.4: 5◦S–5◦N,
120◦W–170◦W) as an ENSO index in our sensitivity studies. The compar-
ison of the principal components reveals satisfactory agreement (r = 0.88)
between the temporal evolution of the simulated and observed SST anoma-
lies.

The HOPE model can be coupled to the statistical atmosphere described
in the previous section instead of being forced by prescribed upper boundary
conditions. Such a combination of an OGCM and a statistical atmosphere
model is generally referred to as a Hybrid Coupled Model (HCM). It shows
a regular oscillation of the SST anomalies with a period of 2.5 years. The
spatial structure and amplitude of the SST anomalies are comparable to
those obtained with prescribed forcing (Fig. 1a).

3 The adjoint model

In this section we deﬁne what we mean by the term ‘adjoint model’ and
present some aspects of the adjoint of the OGCM we constructed.

3.1 Deﬁnition

The system being studied is described by a state vector x of prognostic
be some function, in general non-linear, that
variables. Let the model
computes from an initial state x0 and a set of forcing ﬁelds yi at times

xn =

(x0, yi) .

The tangent model M(x0, yi) is the linear mapping that gives the eﬀect
on xn of inﬁnitesimal changes in the initial state δx0 and in the set of forcing
ﬁelds δyi

δxn = M(x0, yi)

(12)

ǫ

Let f (xn) be some scalar function of the ﬁnal state, for instance an averaged
ﬁeld, index or cost function. We can now compute the change in this function
of the ﬁnal state as a result of a change in the initial state and forcing ﬁelds
as

δf (xn) =

δxn =

M(x0, yi)

,

with the mapping M †(x0, yi) the adjoint model. It propagates the sensitivi-
ties of the scalar f to the ﬁnal state back to the initial state, and can be seen
as a backward derivative of the model.

In practice, the model
xi+1(xi, yi) for i = 0, . . . , n

consists of a series of discrete time steps xi
1, so

→

xn = xn(xn−1, yn−1)

= xn(xn−1(xn−2, yn−2), yn−1)
= . . .

The adjoint model is then evaluated by time-stepping the discrete model
back from tn to to, at each step applying the chain rule of diﬀerentiation
with respect to the model variables

(16)

Note that the evolution of the adjoint ﬁelds ∂f /∂xi does not depend on the
function f , hence except for the initialization of ∂f /∂xn the adjoint model
is independent of the function f . Physically, the adjoint ﬁeld represents the
sensitivity of f to inﬁnitesimal perturbations of the prior state xi and forcing
ﬁeld yi. For a non-linear model
, the response to a ﬁnite perturbation may
or may not be similar. An example of the latter case is convection, which is
often represented by a step function of the diﬀerence in density of two layers.
The derivative of this function to the density is zero almost everywhere, yet
a ﬁnite perturbation can induce or inhibit convection.

M

The two types of adjoint ﬁelds in Eqs (15) and (16) are conceptually dif-
ferent. Derivatives to forcing ﬁelds ∂f /∂yi (for instance externally prescribed
ﬂuxes) are not used at times t < ti. These adjoint ﬁelds thus represent quan-
tities that can be varied independently. On the other hand, derivatives to
internal model state ﬁelds ∂f /∂xi are used in the previous time step to com-
pute ∂f /∂xi−1, and hence cannot explicitly be varied without invalidating
the adjoint model for t < ti.

As deﬁned above the adjoint ﬁeld is an extensive variable: the inﬂuence of
a single grid box is proportional to its size. Also, the inﬂuence is proportional
to the time step used. We therefore normalize the adjoint ﬁeld to the grid
box size and a time interval of one day and give the derivative to forcing
ﬁelds (ﬂuxes) in units [f ]/([x] day sr).

3.2 Adjoint HOPE and atmosphere models

We constructed adjoint models (as deﬁned above) of the ocean and atmo-
sphere models in the following way.

In HOPE, a time step consists of a cycle of separate tasks (split oper-
ators). For each of these subroutines (or easily deﬁnable subdivisions) the
adjoint code was generated using the Adjoint Model Compiler (Giering and
Kaminski, 1996; Giering, 1994). This tool gives computer code which is the
adjoint of the original algorithm. This code was hand-optimized in some al-
gorithms where there is an simpler formulation (the inversion of tridiagonal
matrices). These adjoint subroutines where then integrated into an adjoint
model. Further details can be found in Appendix A.

This construction gives the exact adjoint of the complete (discrete) model.
We realize that there are many partial derivatives that can probably be safely
neglected, like the dependence of the mixing parameters on the temperature
and the detailed intricacies of the equation of state. However, it is a nontrivial
task to verify that omissions are in fact harmless, and we did not (yet)
perform this analysis.

9

There is one point where it was necessary to deviate from the exact deriva-
tives to include some non-linear eﬀects. In our model the vertical eddy vis-
cosity AV and diﬀusivity DV depend on the Richardson number R as

−

R′ = max(0, R)

(17)

(18)

(20)

with CA = CD = 5. For marginally stable layers (0 < R < Rcut = 0.3)
the large derivatives ∂AV /∂R, ∂DV /∂R are not very good estimates for the
eﬀect of a ﬁnite perturbation, as the functions have very sharp kinks at
R = 0. In practice this manifests itself as dipoles of very strong positive and
negative inﬂuence one vertical grid point apart in the adjoint temperature
and salinity ﬁelds. This instability can be suppressed by smoothing the
derivatives of Eqs (17–18). In the evaluation of the derivative, we therefore
use R′ = R2

cut/R for 0 < R < Rcut.

The adjoint of the statistical atmosphere model was constructed in a
similar fashion. As this is a linear model, it does not depend on the forward
ﬁelds, which simpliﬁes the code. The time lag between the SST and ﬂuxes
that the atmosphere model introduces has been taken into account.

4 Sensitivity experiments

To investigate the causes of temperature changes in the eastern tropical Pa-
ciﬁc in the HOPE model we performed a few experiments with the adjoint
HOPE model described in section 3.2 using prescribed ﬂuxes. These experi-
ments are the exact opposite of perturbation experiments that search for all
eﬀects of one given perturbation, usually a wind burst (e.g., Giese and Harri-
son, 1990). We search backwards in time to ﬁnd all sensitivities of one target
function, which we take to be the NINO3 (or NINO3.4) index of SST in the
eastern Paciﬁc. A sensitivity ﬁeld gives the change in the target function if
we would have added a perturbation at that time and place.

From perturbation studies and lag-correlation analyses (Gill, 1982; Phi-
lander, 1990) it has been found that many perturbations propagate as equa-
torial Kelvin or Rossby waves. The baroclinic Kelvin waves travel east-
wards within a few degrees of the equator, with a speed of 2–3 ms−1. The

10

n-th mode Rossby waves travel to the west at 1/(2n + 1) times this speed,
with a maximum perturbation to the sea level for the ﬁrst three modes at
about 5◦, 8–10◦ and 12–15◦ oﬀ the equator (in theory, these are
3/2, √3

q

q

(5 + √18)/2 Rossby radii). This propagation implies that sensitivities
and
propagate backwards along the same trajectories, which we refer to as ad-
joint Kelvin or Rossby waves. We will verify this interpretation by checking
that the propagation speed is consistent with predictions from linear theory.
As background for the sensitivity experiments we used the years 1987 and
1988. In 1987 there was an El-Ni˜no episode (the observed NINO3 index was
+1.5 K to +2.0 K for much of the year, but had returned to 1.0 K by the end
1.5 K). As
of December), whereas 1988 ended on a strong cold anomaly (
target dates we took October 1987 (warm), December 1987 (transition) and
December 1988 (cold). We studied the sensitivity of the NINO3 index N3
(NINO3.4 index N3.4) at these times to various ﬁelds at earlier times. The
interesting ones are the input ﬂuxes (wind stress τx,y and the heat ﬂux Q)
and state variable sea level height ζ. The former have been averaged over 7.5
day ‘weeks’, the latter is sampled at the beginning of these periods1. Unless
otherwise noticed the illustrations are from the run to December 1987.

−

4.1 Sea level

The clearest signals can be seen in the sensitivity to the sea level. This is
due to the fact that, as in the forward case, the adjoint Kelvin and Rossby
waves are clearly separated by latitude. In the eastern Paciﬁc, temperature
and sea level are very strongly correlated. A higher sea level indicates a
deeper thermocline, which in turn causes the sea surface to be less cold.
It is therefore no surprise to see that at the end of December 1987, just
before the target date, the NINO3 index would have been higher if the sea
level would have been higher in the same area. The NINO3 index is the
average temperature in the middle box shown in Fig. 3a. The sensitivity is
thus positive and conﬁned to this region, with an emphasis on the upwelling
region. (The slightly negative ﬁeld in the western Paciﬁc is a weak barotropic
mode.)

Going back in time, at the beginning of November (Fig. 3b), one can see
an adjoint Kelvin wave coming from the western Paciﬁc, and some adjoint
n = 1 Rossby waves coming from the eastern boundary. The adjoint Kelvin
if the sea level would have been
wave should be interpreted as follows:
inﬁnitesimally higher in the stippled area in November 1987, then there would

have been a baroclinic Kelvin wave added to the actual state at the position
indicated, and the temperature would have been inﬁnitesimally higher in the
NINO3 area 2 months later. The Kelvin wave would have depressed the
thermocline in that region.

In the beginning of July (Fig. 3c), all the adjoint Rossby waves going to
the measurement region from the eastern boundary have reached the coast.
These are partially reﬂected and on the way back as the tail of the direct
adjoint Kelvin wave. The resolution does not permit coastal Kelvin waves
to travel north and south. On the other side, the adjoint equatorial Kelvin
wave has reﬂected at the western coasts into a set of adjoint Rossby waves.
The ﬁrst blob at 165◦W corresponds to the n = 1 reﬂection oﬀ New Guinea,
the second one (at 150◦E) has been reﬂected oﬀ the Philippines. (The HOPE
land-sea mask has approximately two north-south walls at these locations.)
At the same longitude the n = 2 reﬂection oﬀ New Guinea is forming, and
further west the beginnings of higher-order adjoint Rossby waves can be
discerned. The presence of the parity-odd n = 2 mode is due to the fact that
the western coast has some structure in our model.

Three months earlier (Fig. 3d) the ﬁrst adjoint Rossby wave has almost
dissipated, the strongest signal is now at 160◦W. The southern n = 2 signal
is now at the dateline, whereas the northern reﬂection has reached 150◦E,
clearly separated from the n = 3 reﬂection. The situation at the beginning
of January is not much diﬀerent (Fig. 3e).

At the beginning of July 1986, 18 months before the NINO3 index is
evaluated (Fig. 3f), the only inﬂuence remaining is a pattern of higher order
Rossby waves that slowly traverses the basin. This sensitivity on the sea level,
and equivalently the thermocline depth, of the oﬀ-equatorial warm pool is in
agreement with the original recharge hypothesis (Wyrtki, 1975). However,
a sensitivity of the NINO indices to the zonally-avergaed thermocline depth
along the equator at this time scale (Jin, 1997) is not seen.

The reﬂection pattern oﬀ the western coasts is clearly visible in the space-
time diagrams of 5◦ latitude bands at 5◦N, the equator and 5◦S in Fig. 4. In
1987, the adjoint Kelvin wave, travelling at about 2 ms−1 (dashed line in Fig.
4b) reaches the coast of New Guinea in the ﬁrst week of October, generating
a Rossby wave at 5◦S that picks up a Northern component some time later.
The main reﬂection at 120◦E occurs at the end of September.

The demise of the ﬁrst adjoint Rossby wave at the edge of the warm pool
seems to give rise to a second adjoint Kelvin wave travelling back to the
western boundary. At the same time the Kelvin wave reﬂected at the east
coast arrives, especially in the 1988 experiment with strong adjoint n = 1
Rossby waves in the eastern Paciﬁc. This Kelvin wave is reinforced by the
energy reﬂected oﬀ the western coast of New Guinea by the Rossby wave

reﬂected oﬀ the Philippines. Halfway July this generates a third adjoint
Rossby wave. This western mechanism seems to produce a fourth and ﬁfth
Rossby wave in February 1987 and November 1986 respectively.

These reﬂected Rossby waves merge into a structure with an eﬀective
group velocity that is signiﬁcantly lower than the phase velocity of the indi-
vidual n = 1 Rossby waves, indicated by the dashed lines in Fig. 4a,c with
speed 0.6 ms−1. This behaviour is very similar to the properties of the ob-
served Kelvin and Rossby waves that constitute ENSO oscillations (Chao
and Philander, 1993; ?).

In 1987, there are also adjoint Rossby waves with opposite sign east of
150◦W. They are generated by the adjoint Kelvin wave leaving the NINO3
signal region and reach the eastern coast within a few months. These waves
are much stronger in 1988, in cold conditions. The adjoint Kelvin wave is
faster and weaker, and a second Kelvin wave is now clearly generated by
the Rossby wave activity reﬂecting oﬀ the east coast. In HOPE the NINO3
region is characterized by intense currents and changes in thermocline depth
at this time, so that linear theory is not applicable. The reﬂected adjoint
Rossby waves seem to have the same speed as in 1987, but are again weaker.
These reﬂection patterns are compatible with observations from sea level
measurements near the eastern and western boundaries (Boulanger and Fu,
1996). Some of the discrepancies at the western coast reported in this paper
may be explained by the multiple reﬂections observed in our model.

4.2 Wave speeds

To check the interpretation of Kelvin and Rossby waves, we have measured
the speeds of the structures visible in the adjoint run and compared the
results to wave speeds calculated from the density structure of the model.

The speed was estimated by taking 1- and 2-month lag correlations for
each latitude. From Fig. 5 one can read oﬀ the following speeds for the
waves. In the last month of the run leading to the NINO3 index at the end
of December 1987, the equatorial Kelvin wave has a speed that varies between
1.8 ms−1 at 1◦S, 2.0 ms−1 on the equator and 2.4 ms−1 at 2◦N (Fig. 5a). In
the experiment leading to October 1987 we ﬁnd speeds of 2.1 to 2.9 ms−1
(Fig. 5b), and at the end of 1988 they are just over 3 ms−1 (Fig. 5c).

The Rossby waves during these times in the Eastern Paciﬁc have speeds
at 5◦N of 0.5 ms−1, 0.4 ms−1 and 0.8 ms−1, this is somewhat slower than 1/3
the speed of the Kelvin waves due to the shallower thermocline. The speeds
of reﬂected adjoint Rossby waves in the central Paciﬁc have been read oﬀ
0.55 ms−1
Fig. 5d. The northern branches of the Rossby waves move with
0.16 ms−1 (17◦N). The southern lobes are

The observed adjoint Kelvin waves therefore seem to be a mixture of the
ﬁrst baroclinic mode, with speeds around 3 ms−1, and the second baroclinic
mode, with a speed of around 2 ms−1. This is in agreement with other
theoretical studies (e.g., Giese and Harrison, 1990). Observations of Kelvin
0.3 ms−1 from TOGA-TAO
waves give a single mode with a speed of 2.4
0.9 ms−1 from TOPEX/POSEIDON
subsurface temperatures (?) and 2.9
±
altimetry data (Boulanger and Menkes, 1995; Chelton and Schlax, 1996).
Also, in these observations the shallowing of the thermocline towards the
east is compensated by a stronger density contrast across the thermocline,
leading to an almost constant speed up to 110◦W. In contrast, in HOPE we
observe lower speeds east of 160◦W (see Fig. 4), as the thermocline is not
sharp enough due to discretization eﬀects.

±

These speeds can also be computed from the density proﬁles2 (see, e.g.,
Gill, 1982; Philander, 1990), using a rigid lid to eliminate the barotropic
mode. The ﬁrst three modes of the horizontal velocity are shown in Fig. 6.
The ﬁrst baroclinic mode has a zero around3 1500 m and a Kelvin wave speed
of 2.6–3.3 ms−1, in agreement with the proﬁles discussed in Philander (1990);
Giese and Harrison (1990). The next modes have their ﬁrst zeroes near
the thermocline, at around 100–150 m in the equatorial zone, substantially
deeper elsewhere. The speed ﬁelds are shown in Fig. 7.

With a well-developed thermocline, as in the western and central Paciﬁc,
and in the east during the December 1987 run (Fig. 6a,b), a Kelvin wave
in the ﬁrst baroclinic mode mode does not inﬂuence the NINO3 index of
surface temperatures as much as one in the second mode. The eigenfunction
has a small amplitude at the surface, and the Richardson-number dependent
mixing scheme, Eqs (17–18), eﬀectively decouples the ocean below the ther-
mocline. However, when the thermocline is absent in the cold tongue, as our
model generates in December 1988 (Fig. 6d), the ﬁrst mode is most eﬀective
in changing the SST in the NINO3 area, although the adjoint Kelvin wave
is weaker in this case (see Figs 4b,e). The October 1987 run, with a weak
thermocline, excites adjoint Kelvin waves in both modes.

2This computation depends somewhat on the mixing scheme, and is done for mixing
parameters proportional to 1/N 2, which diﬀers from the Richardson-number based scheme
with a mixed layer of the HOPE model. The diﬀerence will be mainly in the absence of a
mixed layer in the computed modes.

3This mode seems to be associated with the rise in salinity around that depth in the

Paciﬁc, which is absent in the Atlantic

Figure 7: The speeds in ms−1 of the ﬁrst (a) and second (b) baroclinic modes
deduced from the density proﬁles at the end of 1987.

The speed of the second mode Kelvin wave in the December 1987 run
(Fig. 5a) is slightly higher than the 1.8 to 2.1 ms−1 read oﬀ from the area
west of the NINO3 box in Fig. 7b. In 1988 the speed corresponds well with the
little over 3 ms−1 read oﬀ from Fig. 7a. The n = 1 reﬂected adjoint Rossby
waves correspond reasonably well with 1/3 the zonally averaged speed of
the second mode (0.57 ms−1 at 5◦S, 0.62 ms−1 at 5◦N); the same holds for
n = 2 (1/5) at 10◦N (0.34 ms−1) in all experiments. Note that this means
that during the reﬂection oﬀ the western boundary energy can ﬂow from the
second into the ﬁrst baroclinic mode; the WKB approximation breaks down
when the depth changes signiﬁcantly on scales comparable to the wavelength.
The speeds at the other extrema in Fig. 5d, corresponding to higher-order
Rossby modes, are much lower and seem to resemble more the speed of the
third baroclinic mode (0.21 ms−1 at 11◦S, 0.15 ms−1 at 19◦S and 0.17 ms−1 at
15◦N). Unfortunately the derivatives to the horizontal speeds are too noisy
to determine their vertical structure, we can only assume that the second
and third modes can also be mixed up in the shallow water at the western
coasts.

4.3 Wind stress

The derivative to the wind stress is a superposition of the wind ﬁelds asso-
ciated with the Kelvin and Rossby waves. In Fig. 8 we show the situation

weeks of November (b), July (c), April (d) and January 1987 (e), and July
1986 (f)

20

at the same times as the sensitivity to the sea level height in Fig. 3. These
ﬁelds have the following interpretation: if there would have been a positive
(eastward) anomalous wind ﬁeld at the position of a positive derivative, then
the NINO3 index would have been higher at the end of 1987.

During the ﬁrst week of the adjoint run (Fig. 8a), one sees that a positive
wind anomaly (weaker trade winds) reduces upwelling, and hence heats up
the NINO3 region. At the extreme eastern end of the region a positive
anomaly causes a more divergent wind ﬁeld, and hence more upwelling and
a lower NINO3 index.

At earlier times the disturbance caused by an anomalous wind ﬁeld has to
propagate to the eastern Paciﬁc in order to inﬂuence this index. Comparing
with the derivatives to the sea level (Fig. 3), one sees the textbook relations
(e.g., Gill, 1982) that for a Kelvin wave the zonal wind ﬁeld and sea level
have the same shape, whereas an n = 1 Rossby wave has an anti-cyclonal
circulation around a positive sea level anomaly. The n = 2 wave clearly de-
velops its antisymmetric wind ﬁeld (for instance at 160◦E in Fig. 8c), whereas
the n = 3 Rossby wave is symmetric again. However, the wind-ﬁeld sensi-
tivity of the higher order modes is much weaker than the sensitivity of the
n = 1 mode. The 1988 experiment, during cold conditions, shows a weaker
dependence on wind stress; discussion of this eﬀect is delayed to section 5.

The result of these adjoint Kelvin and Rossby waves is that during the
half year leading up to the measurement the sensitivity to τx at the date line
is positive, meaning that a weaker easterly trade wind or even westerly wind
will increase the SST at the NINO3 region. At earlier times, the sensitivity
has the opposite sign — a westerly anomaly will cool the NINO3 region at
these lead times.

The sensitivity to the meridional wind stress τy is much smaller, and just
shows the edges of the structures visible in the derivative to the sea level,
Fig. 3.

4.4 Heat ﬂux

Finally, an obvious inﬂuence on the surface temperature in the NINO3 region
is the heat ﬂux into this area, or, almost equivalently, the temperature some
time previously due to persistence. This is relevant only for the last few
months preceding the measurement. In Fig. 9 we plot this derivative as a
function of time at the equator. Except for some waves that are excited in
August–September the sensitivity drops oﬀ exponentially with a time scale
5 days). There is some advection from the north-
of about one month (25
east, but this does not extend beyond a few degrees of latitude outside the
NINO3 area.

to 5◦N (the vertical lines connect the weekly measurements).

n = 1 Rossby waves are excited at the point where the thermocline is very
shallow in the HOPE model (around 140◦W); we assume that heat input at
this point lowers the thermocline and thus excites waves; only the Rossby
waves travel in the right direction to inﬂuence the NINO3 index. In other
circumstances a heat ﬂux does not eﬃciently excite long waves.

5 The delayed oscillator in HOPE

5.1 Outline

The experiments described in the previous section give the sensitivities of
an uncoupled ocean model driven by prescribed ﬂuxes. We would like to
compare this with the concept of the delayed oscillator. To this end we take
as a reference trajectory xi the model climatology (assuming this is in fact a
solution of the model equations), and interpret the small deviations δx in the
adjoint as anomalies with respect to this monthly climatology. An adjoint
experiment with as target function the NINO index N (either NINO3 or
NINO3.4) then gives for the contribution of the atmosphere to the index
anomaly

integral over the area is indicated by the dotproduct. This relationship is not
exact: non-linear terms are not included in the adjoint, but certainly play a
role with temperature anomalies of a few Kelvin. The non-linear terms will
show up as diﬀerent values of the sensitivities ∂N/∂
for diﬀerent states of
the system.

We refer to each term of the sum in Eq. (21) as the inﬂuence of this
month on the target function. With the help of the adjoint of the statistical

with δTi the HOPE SST anomaly ﬁeld. Of course, as the statistical atmo-
sphere was not in fact used in the forward run we have to check that this
approximation holds, i.e., that the statistical atmosphere would have given
ﬂuxes similar to the ones actually used.

F

The total anomaly of the NINO index, δN, consists of the atmospheric
contribution described above, plus contributions from the derivative to the
initial state and the relaxation to the observed SST. The inﬂuence of the
initial state x0 can be neglected for integration times longer than about 1.5
years in our model (see Fig. 10). The inﬂuence of the relaxation, which was
necessary to keep the model close to reality, is of course very artiﬁcial and is
not considered further.

The next step is to try to factorize these inﬂuences into a sensitivity times

an anomaly. To this end we use an EOF expansion

The variation of the coeeﬁcients ai with the conditions in diﬀerent experi-
ments points to non-linear eﬀects parametrized by cubic terms. This formu-
lation is similar to the ﬁnite-diﬀerence scheme introduced in the last section
of Cane et al. (1990). The time delays inherent in the propagation of Kelvin
waves to the eastern Paciﬁc compared to the heat retention scale make a
ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme a more natural choice than a diﬀerential form.

5.2

Inﬂuence of SST anomalies

We try to follow these steps for the experiments described in section 4. The
ﬁrst step is to study the inﬂuences deﬁned in Eq. (21) over two years previous
to the measurements. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd large inﬂuences in the extra-
tropics, probably due to spurious correlations in the statistical atmosphere
model. There are also well-known problems of our HOPE version in the Gulf
of Panama. We therefore only take into account the region 20◦S to 20◦N
west of 120◦W, and 5◦S to 5◦N east of this line. It is clear that the NINO3.4
index is further away from the problem regions, so we concentrate on this
index (which, incidentally, is also more persistent and easier to predict).

The inﬂuences of Eq. (21) are plotted in Fig. 10 for three experiments in
1986–1988. The anomalies where computed as in the statistical atmosphere,
relative to a 30-year average of model-generated temperatures.
It is clear
that, within the restrictions of the model and adjoint model, the inﬂuence
of temperature anomalies more than one year before the measurement is
minimal.

The sums of the inﬂuences plotted in Fig. 10 are shown in Table 1. The
transition and cold experiments are reproduced fairly well, but it seems that
the statistical atmosphere would not have been able to simulate the warm
phase correctly. The ﬁrst EOF explains 60–100% of the inﬂuences.

We can conclude that the statistical atmosphere, restricted to the tropical
region, does a reasonable job of propagating the sensitivities of the NINO3.4
index to ﬂuxes into sensitivities to SST.

5.3 Sensitivities of the indices to themselves

We now have the inﬂuences in the factorizable form of Eq. (23). In order
to obtain a description which can be compared to the delayed oscillator

paradigm we convert the sensitivities to the EOF to sensitivities to the indices
themselves. Over the 42-year simulation period discussed in section 2.3 we

ﬁnd that δTi

r = 0.96 with the NINO3.4 index; the corresponding constants are C (1)
3 =
0.57 and C (1)
3.4 = 0.51. The derivatives were ﬁtted over the last 12 months
of the six experiments. Except for the ﬁnal two months, when the adjoint
ﬁelds are still close to the index region, the agreement is very good, as the
adjoint ﬁelds are mainly conﬁned to the tropical region. The proportionality
constants are C (2)

3 = 2.8, C (2)

3.4 = 4.2.

Finally, we can study the sensitivity of a NINO index to itself a few
months earlier, ∂Nn/∂Ni, which is shown in Fig. 11. The total sensitivity
dNn/dNi that occurs in the discretized form of the delayed oscillator equation
(26) is larger by a factor of about 1.5C (1)C (2); this is 2.4 for the NINO3 index,
3.6 for the NINO3.4 index. This scale factor has a rather large uncertainty
due to the various approximations made.

As expected, the ‘immediate’ positive feedback diﬀers very much between
a situation where the index is falling to zero (Dec 1987) and a situation in
which the index is strongly positive (Oct 1987) or negative (Dec 1988). This
is the eﬀect of the non-linear eﬀects that are parametrized by the T 3 term in
Eq. (1). In cold conditions, the thermocline has disappeared in our model, so
that a Kelwin wave in the second baroclinic mode, varying the thermocline
depth, is not very eﬀective at changing SST. During a warm epsiode the
thermocline is so deep that the eﬀect of such a wave is also smaller. The
eﬀect of a Kelvin wave in the ﬁrst baroclinic mode is not sensitive to the
thermocline depth. The eﬀect of these nonlinearities in the positive feedback
is larger for the NINO3 index than for the NINO3.4 index, as the thermocline
is shallower in the NINO3 region and hence variations of its depth have a
larger eﬀect.

The approximation that the Bjerknes feedback is instantaneous does not
seem to be a very good one, especially for the NINO3 index. Part of the
delay is due to the artiﬁcial 1-month delay of the statistical atmosphere, but
another 2–3 months are due to time it takes for a Kelvin wave generated at
the date line to reach the signal region. This eﬀect is of course smaller for
the NINO3.4 index.

The negative feedback consists of an overlapping train of n = 1 Rossby
waves that are reﬂected oﬀ diﬀerent parts of the coast, instead of an idealized
peak. Combined with the lower eﬀective group velocity shown in Fig. 4 we
obtain negative inﬂuences from 6 to about 18 months prior to the measure-
ment. Higher order Rossby waves do not contribute at these timescales. Due
to the normalization uncertainties it is diﬃcult to gauge the extend to which

the summed positive feedback exceeds one, and compare this quantitatively
with the negative feedback terms (i.e., to determine the parameters in Eq. (1)
or Eq. (26) in our model).

However, it is clear from the ﬁgure that the negative terms do not depend
on the initial state in the same non-linear way as the positive terms. The
negative feedback is much stronger than expected for the December 1988
experiments. We suspect that this is due to the non-linear interactions be-
tween the diﬀerent baroclinic modes that we observed in section 4.2. The
weak positive response was due to the small amplitude at the surface of the
ﬁrst baroclinic mode adjoint Kelvin wave that is excited. On the other hand,
the adjoint Rossby waves that determine the negative feedback propagate
in the usual second baroclinic mode in the thermocline, which has a larger
amplitude at the surface for the same energy content and is thus more eas-
ily excited by a wind anomaly. At the reﬂection in shallower waters at the
western boundary the energy is transferred down from Rossby waves in the
second baroclinic mode to Kelvin waves in the deeper ﬁrst mode.

6 Conclusions

We studied the causes of variations of the sea surface temperature in the
eastern equatorial Paciﬁc with an adjoint OGCM and statistical atmosphere.
The adjoint gives us ﬁrst-order estimates of the sensitivity of the NINO3 and
NINO3.4 indices of this temperature to forcing ﬁelds and state ﬁelds some
time earlier. We generated these sensitivities at the end of October 1987,
December 1987 and December 1988; respectively warm, transition and cold
phases of ENSO. In these experiments we used prescribed ﬂuxes to drive the
ocean model HOPE.

The sensitivities either damp out exponentially (heat ﬂux, previous SST)
with a time scale of about one month, or propagate as equatorial Kelvin and
Rossby waves (wind stress, sea level). Of course, without a full atmosphere
model we cannot observe small-scale coupled modes.

A change in temperature of the NINO3 region can be eﬀected by a Rossby
wave coming from the eastern coast. In our model some of this inﬂuence is
reﬂected back — an equatorial Kelvin wave impinging on the eastern coast
can generate such a Rossby wave, albeit not very eﬃciently. Another way
the temperature can be changed is by the arrival of a Kelvin wave from
the west; these are clearly visible in the sensitivities to the wind stress and
sea level. This Kelvin wave can be generated by Rossby waves reﬂecting
oﬀ the coast of New Guinea and the Philippines, either directly or with a
few months’ delay at the western boundary area. These delays, combined

28

with the eastern reﬂections, give rise to an eﬀective group velocity of the
sensitivities that is lower than the speed of the individual Kelvin and Rossby
waves. Higher order adjoint Rossby waves are observed, but do not have a
strong enough wind stress sensitivity ﬁeld to be able to inﬂuence the eastern
Paciﬁc. These waves sum to a sensitivity to the thermocline depth in the
warm pool oﬀ the equator, but there is no sensitivity to the zonally-averaged
thermocline depth along the equator at long timescales.

The speed of the adjoint Kelvin waves depends very much on the state
of the ocean in our model at the measurement region. Note that we do
not simulate Kelvin waves as they occur in the ocean, but as they inﬂuence
the NINO3 index. Normally these propagate in the second baroclinic mode
2 ms−1 in the western and central
(with a zero at the thermocline), with c
Paciﬁc. However, in the cold tongue during the cold phase (La Ni˜na), the
thermocline is so shallow that the ﬁrst baroclinic mode is excited, with a
3 ms−1 in the central Paciﬁc. These diﬀerent modes mix at the
speed c
reﬂection in shallow waters at the west coast; the reﬂected adjoint Rossby
waves have speeds compatible with the second baroclinic modes (the third
for higher order Rossby waves). These results should be compared to an
0.3 ms−1, independent of longitude, from the TOGA-
observed speed of 2.4
TAO array.

We used an adjoint statistical atmosphere model to convert the sensitiv-
ities into ﬂuxes (mainly wind stress) into sensitivities to the SST. This gives
a reasonable description of the observed NINO3.4 index anomalies at the
three times we did experiments for. Next we compared these inﬂuences with
the average index anomaly times the average sensitivity in the corresponding
region. This underestimates the size of the inﬂuence by a factor of roughly
four, but does not change the shape as a function of time very much, due to
the high correlations of the neglected terms with the included ones.

The resulting response function (Fig. 11) shows the essence of the delayed
oscillator mechanism. Going back from the measurement time, the ﬁrst few
months exhibit the positive feedback of the change in trade winds reinforcing
the SST anomaly. At about half a year before the target date the feedback
changes sign as Rossby waves reﬂect oﬀ the western coast as Kelvin waves
with opposite polarity. Both these feedback loops are spread out in time.
Kelvin waves are excited most easily in the central Paciﬁc and take about
two months to travel to the signal region, and the reﬂections at the western
side occur at diﬀerent longitudes so that the inﬂuence of Rossby waves is
spread out over half a year as well.

We also observe that the positive feedback is much stronger when the
system is in transition (Dec 1987), than when it is in a warm (Oct 1987) or
cold (Dec 1988) phase, pointing to a role of non-linear terms in restraining

29

the delayed oscillator. We do not observe this eﬀect in the delayed response.

A Technical details of the adjoint model

Most of the adjoint code was generated by automatic diﬀerentiation of the
Fortran code of the HOPE and statistical atmosphere models by the (T)AMC
(Giering, 1994, 1997). The exceptions were the horizontal and vertical dif-
fusion and viscosity computations in HOPE. These involve the inversion of
a tridiagonal matrix, the adjoint of can be written much simpler than the
automatically-generated algorithm. We have not checked the code for vec-
torization as all experiments reported here were performed on a scalar CPU
(MIPS R10000).

M

The adjoint model M † depends both on the adjoint ﬁelds ∂/∂x and the
ﬁelds of the reference trajectory x for non-linear functions
. The latter
ﬁelds are saved from the forward run of the model to be used in the backward
run of the adjoint model in a three-layer scheme. To compute the adjoint
of one day (12 ocean time steps), the model is run forward over this period
while storing ﬁelds needed in non-linear transformations on a direct-access
ﬁle. Saving these in single precision, and eliminating the multiple storage of
the slowly-varying temperature and salinity ﬁelds per time step one obtains
a 250 MB storage ﬁle (21 3D ﬁelds of 2*97*61*20 numbers per time step
times 12 steps per day). These daily runs are restarted from restart ﬁles
generated by a one-month run. Each (modiﬁed) restart ﬁle takes 8 MB (8
3D ﬁelds). The monthly restart ﬁles are generated by a top-level run. In all
the storage requirements are about 500 MB disk space. The run-time size of
the program is 130 MB.

Apart from end eﬀects (the last month can be skipped on the highest
level) the running time for an adjoint run is three forward runs (total, month
and day) and one backward run. The latter includes many forward recom-
putations, and takes about 2–3 times longer than a forward run. The total
cost of a full adjoint run is therefore 5–6 times the cost of a forward run in
CPU time. To this one should add the cost of writing and reading 250 MB
temporary storage per simulated day.

We veriﬁed whether ﬁnite perturbations of the initial state ﬁelds did in
fact give results in agreement with the adjoint model, which is only strictly

30

valid for inﬁnitesimal perturbations. For small random perturbations (1–6
wavelengths in x and y and 0–1 in z tapering oﬀ with depth) of all initial
state variables except temperature and salinity we obtain good agreement
with the derivative up to more than 6 months. We did not include variations
of the temperature and salinity ﬁelds as these give rise to diﬀerent convection
patterns, mainly in the mixed layer at high latitudes. The derivative to
the most important input variable, τx, is validated more systematically in
Appendix B.

B Validation

Although the linear dynamics we found in section 4 looks plausible, it remains
to be veriﬁed that non-linear eﬀects do not in fact dominate in the model
(let alone in Nature). For this purpose we compared the inﬂuence of zonal
wind ﬁelds on the NINO3 index at the end of 1987 with the predictions of
the adjoint model, cf. Eq. (12)

δN3 ≈

∂N3
∂τx

δτx .

(27)

All deviations are relative to a forward run with prescribed ﬂuxes4. For the
extra wind ﬁeld δτx we chose a longitude with a large inﬂuence, the size
1.4◦ with a zonal extent of 20◦; the zonal
was two grid points at latitude
5◦. The duration of the storm was matched to

0.05 K (1 month) to 0.01 K (1 year) for the higher wind stress.

In Fig. 12 we present the results of these experiments. In the initial ad-
joint Kelvin wave (Sep–Dec) the ratios almost always are within the range
0.8–1.3. Smaller wind ﬁelds give better results, as the error is dominated
by non-linear eﬀects. The exceptions are in September, when the reﬂected
Rossby waves inﬂuence the picture. The previous two months (Jul–Aug),
when the reﬂections are building up and the perturbations are near the west-
ern coast, the adjoint performs poorly. For higher wind ﬁelds the ration lies
between 0.2 and 2. These perturbations send waves of both signs across the
Paciﬁc, so the ﬁnal perturbation of the NINO3 index is a sum of positive and
negative patches that is very sensitive to details.

The situation improves when the adjoint Rossby waves are clearly estab-
lished (Jan—Jun). When the signal is not too weak the prediction for the

stronger winds is accurate to within a factor 0.4–1.6 (it tends to be a bit
too low). The error is dominated by noise, so that the lower wind ﬁelds give
worse results. In the previous year we only investigated the stronger wind
ﬁelds. One sees the same pattern: the well-deﬁned ﬁrst Rossby wave gives
reasonable agreement (although the derivative again underestimates the real
eﬀect by a factor 1.5 on average). However, the eﬀect of a wind ﬁeld outside
the strongest wave is predicted poorly by the adjoint.

We also studied the eﬀect of stronger anomalous wind stress ﬁelds, δτx =
0.2 Nm−2, which is the typical strength of a westerly wind burst (Giese and
Harrison, 1990). The results are presented in Table 2. Non-linear eﬀects
worsen the agreement at short lead times compared to more gentle pertur-
bations, but at longer lead times the results are comparable.

In all, it seems we can trust the sensitivities of the adjoint model most
of the time to within a factor 2, even to one year back. This does not hold
when the expected deviation is small, or when the perturbation is near the
western coasts so that reﬂected and direct waves interfere.

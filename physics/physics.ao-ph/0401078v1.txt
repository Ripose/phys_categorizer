Summary We consider a multilayer generalization of Ripa’s inhomogeneous single-layer primitive equations model. In addition to
vary arbitrarily in horizontal position and time, the horizontal velocity and buoyancy ﬁelds are allowed to vary linearly with depth
within each layer of the model. Preliminary results on linear waves and baroclinic instability suggest that a conﬁguration involving a
few layers may set the basis for a quite accurate and numerically efﬁcient ocean model.

INTRODUCTION

Because of the physical and practical relevance of layer models, methods to accommodate thermodynamic processes into
these models have been developed. The simplest method consists of allowing the buoyancy ﬁeld to vary in horizontal
position and time, but keeping all dynamical ﬁelds as depth independent. This is formally achieved by replacing the
horizontal pressure gradient by its vertical average [4]. The resulting inhomogeneous layer models, usually referred to as
“slab” models, have been extensively used in ocean modeling.
Despite their widespread use, slab models are known to have several limitations and deﬁciencies [6]. For instance, they
cannot represent explicitly within each layer the thermal-wind balance which dominates at low frequency. This balance is
fundamental in processes like frontogenesis, which has been shown to be incorrectly described by slab models [3]. Also,
slab models have a spurious zero-frequency mode in which the layer thickness and buoyancy changes without changing the
ﬂow, and whose unlimited growth cannot be prevented by the invariants that constrain the (inviscid, unforced) dynamics.
To cure the slab models limitations and deﬁciencies, Ripa [5] proposed an improved closure to partially incorporate
thermodynamic processes in a one-layer model. In addition to allowing arbitrary velocity and buoyancy variations in
horizontal position and time, Ripa’s model allows the horizontal velocity and buoyancy ﬁelds to vary linearly with depth.
The model, which has been generalized to an arbitrary number of layers by Beron-Vera [1], enjoys a number of properties
which make it very promising for applications. As a base test for the validity of the generalized Ripa’s model we consider
linear waves, focusing particularly on vertical normal-mode phase speeds, and classical baroclinic instability.

THE GENERALIZED MODEL

To generalize Ripa’s single-layer model one needs to consider a stack of n active ﬂuid layers of thickness hi(x, t), which
are limited from below by an irregular, rigid surface and from above by a free surface (rigid bottom setting) or vice versa
(rigid lid setting). Above (resp., below) the active ﬂuid there is an inert, inﬁnitely thick layer of lighter (resp., denser)
ﬂuid in the rigid bottom (resp., lid) case. For the ith-layer horizontal velocity and buoyancy relative to the inert layer,
respectively, one must then write

ui(x, σ, t) = ¯ui(x, t) + σuσ

σ
i (x, t), ϑi(x, σ, t) = ¯ϑi(x, t) + σϑ
i (x, t).

Here, the overbar stands for vertical average within the ith layer, and σ is a scaled vertical coordinate which varies linearly
from
1 at the top of the ith layer. [The upper (resp., lower) sign corresponds to the
rigid bottom (resp., lid) conﬁguration.] The generalized model equations, which follow upon replacing (1) in the (exact)
fully three-dimensional primitive equations, then take the form

Here, f is the Coriolis parameter; ˆz is the vertical unit vector; ∇ is the horizontal gradient; Dia and (Dia)σ are,
respectively, the vertical average and σ components of the ith-layer material derivative of any vector a(x, σ, t) =
σ
¯a(x, t) + σaσ(x, t); and ∇pi and (∇pi)
are, respectively, the vertical average and σ components of the ith-layer
pressure gradient force. (See Refs. [5, 1] for details.)
Some of the attractive properties of this model are the following. First, the model can represent explicitly within each
layer the thermal-wind balance which dominates at low frequency. Second, the model possess a singular Hamiltonian
structure, which is helpful in demonstrating that volume, mass, buoyancy variance, energy, and momentum are preserved
by the dynamics. Third, because of the possibility of a nonuniform vertical stratiﬁcation within each layer, vertical mixing
processes (e.g. exchange of ﬂuid between contiguous layers) can be incorporated more naturally than in slab models.

S), at the top of the active layer, to gr(1

System (2), linearized with respect to a reference state with no currents, can be shown to sustain the usual midlatitude and
equatorial gravity and vortical waves in several vertical normal modes. Here we concentrate on how well these modes
are represented by considering the phase speed of long gravity waves (i.e. the separation constant) in a reference state
characterized by S := 1
r Hr/gr. Here, Nr is the Brunt–V¨ais¨al¨a frequency, Hr is the total thickness of the active ﬂuid
layer, and gr denotes the vertically averaged buoyancy. All these three quantities are held constant here. The reference
buoyancy then varies linearly from gr(1
S), at the base of the active layer.
Physically acceptable values of S must be such that 0 < S < 1 [5, 2]. Figure 1a compares, as a function of S, the phase
speed of long gravity waves assuming fully three-dimensional dynamics and (2) with n = 1, 2, and 3. The comparison is
perfect for the barotropic mode phase speed even including only one layer. The use of two layers amounts to an excellent
representation of the ﬁrst baroclinic mode phase speed, and a very good representation of the second baroclinic mode
phase speed. To reasonably represent also the third baroclinic mode phase speed, no more than three layers are needed.
We now turn our attention to classical baroclinic instability. We thus consider a basic state with a parallel current in an
inﬁnite channel on the f plane, which has a uniform vertical shear and that is in thermal-wind balance with the across-
channel buoyancy gradient. We further set the basic velocity to vary (linearly) from 2U at the top of the active layer to
0 at the base of the active layer. Accordingly, the basic buoyancy ﬁeld varies from gr(1
S) at the top
of the active layer to gr(1
S) at the base of the active layer (y denotes the accross-channel coordinate).
Figure 1b compares in the classical Eady limit, as a function of the along-channel wavenumber, the growth rate of the
most unstable normal-mode perturbation assuming fully three-dimensional dynamics and (2) with n = 1, 2, and 3. The
comparison is almost perfect when three layers are included and very good when two layers are included. When only one
layer is considered, the comparison is not as good but a high wavenumber cutoff of baroclinic instability is present. This
important dynamical feature cannot be represented with a slab single-layer model.

PRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS

We have tested the performance of a novel inhomogeneous primitive equations layer model in two important aspects of
ocean dynamics, namely linear waves and baroclinic instability. The results from these base studies suggest that a model
with a small number of layers may be used as a basis for a quite accurate and numerically economic ocean model. To
make stronger statements on the model’s accuracy and efﬁciency, fully nonlinear, forced–dissipative problems must of
course be considered. This work is currently underway.

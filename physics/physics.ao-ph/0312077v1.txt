abstract

The EOLE Experiment is revisited to study turbulent processes in the lower stratosphere circulation

from a Lagrangian viewpoint and resolve a discrepancy on the slope of the atmospheric energy

spectrum between the work of Morel and Larchevˆeque (1974) and recent studies using aircraft

data. Relative dispersion of balloon pairs is studied by calculating the Finite Scale Lyapunov

Exponent, an exit time-based technique which is particularly eﬃcient in cases where processes

with diﬀerent spatial scales are interfering. Our main result is to reconciliate the EOLE dataset

with recent studies supporting a k−5/3 energy spectrum in the range 100-1000 km. Our results also

show exponential separation at smaller scale, with characteristic time of order 1 day, and agree

with the standard diﬀusion of about 107 m2s−1at large scales. A still open question is the origin

of a k−5/3 spectrum in the mesoscale range, between 100 and 1000 km.

INTRODUCTION

The EOLE project consisted in the release of 483 constant-volume pressurized balloons, in

the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes throughout the period September 1971-March 1972,

at approximately 200 hPa. The life-time of these balloons was from a few days to about one

year, with an average value of about 120 days. Their motion was basically isopycnal except

for small diurnal volume variations of the envelop of less than 1% and inertial oscillations of

a few meters in the vertical, excited by wind shear and small-scale turbulence. The position

of the balloons and meteorological parameters were periodically transmitted to satellite by

ARGOS system. The trajectories of the EOLE experiment still provide nowadays the most

extensive data set of experimental quasi-Lagrangian tracers in the atmosphere for observing

the properties of the medium-to-large-scale motion at the tropopause level.

Both Eulerian and Lagrangian analyses have been performed by several authors. Morel

and Desbois (1974) deduced the mean circulation around 200 hPa from the balloon ﬂights, as

formed by a mid-latitude zonal stream with a meridional proﬁle characterized by a typical ve-

locity

30 ms−1 inside the jet, overimposed to meridional velocity ﬁeld disturbances of much

smaller intensity,

1 ms−1, and to residual standing waves acting as spatial perturbations

∼

∼

of the zonal velocity pattern, producing the typical shape of a meandering jet. These results

have been largely conﬁrmed by operational analysis since then. Morel and Larchevˆeque

(1974), hereafter ML, investigated the synoptic-scale turbulent properties. They measured

the mean square relative velocity and the relative diﬀusivity of balloon pairs, and found

essentially two major regimes for Lagrangian dispersion: exponential separation for time

delays less than 6 days and standard diﬀusion for larger times. These authors also observed

that the scaling of the relative diﬀusivity with the separation length between two balloons

agreed with a direct 2D turbulent cascade, with energy spectrum E(k)

k−3, or steeper,

∼

in the range 100-1000 km. Further Eulerian analyses of large-scale velocity spectra by Des-

bois (1975) were compatible with the scenario proposed by Morel and Larchevˆeque (1974)

about isotropic and homogeneous 2D turbulence with a k−3 energy distribution up to scales

1000 km.

∼

Later, other authors reached for diﬀerent conclusions after observing energy spectra in

the low stratosphere, measured from experimental data recorded from commercial aircraft

ﬂights, Gage (1979), Lilly (1983), Nastrom and Gage (1985). Their picture suggested a 2D

2

turbulent inverse cascade, characterized by the E(k)

k−5/3 spectrum, inside the interval

∼

of scales 100-1000 km.

More recently, Lindborg and Cho (2000, 2001a and 2001b) computed velocity spectra

using data recorded during the MOZAIC program and also found a k−5/3 spectrum. They

suggested a dynamical mechanism diﬀerent from 2D inverse cascade where energy is injected

in the large scales by breaking Rossby-gravity waves and generates a chain process down to

smaller scales. Their hypothesis is supported by the observation of a downscale energy ﬂux,

whereas 2D inverse cascade should exhibit upscale energy ﬂux (Lindborg and Cho, 2000).

We wanted to reconsider this issue by performing a new analysis of the relative dispersion

properties of the EOLE balloons within the framework of dynamical system theory. Relative

dispersion properties are analyzed through the computation of the Finite-Scale Lyapunov

Exponent, or shortly FSLE (Aurell et al. 1997, Artale et al. 1997, Boﬀetta et al. 2000a).

The FSLE is based on the growth rate statistics of the distance between trajectories at ﬁxed

scale, and is a better tool at analyzing scale dependent properties than plain dispersion,

as explained below. This new method has been already exploited for studies of relative

dispersion in atmospheric and oceanic systems (Lacorata et al. 2001, Joseph and Legras

2002, Boﬀetta et al. 2001, LaCasce and Ohlmann 2003, Gioia et al. 2003) and also in

laboratory convection experiments (Boﬀetta et al. 2000b).

This paper is organized as follows:

in section II we describe the FSLE methodology;

section III contains the results obtained from our analysis of the EOLE experimental data;

in section IV we discuss the physical information that can be extracted from this paper and

possible perspectives.

II. FINITE-SCALE RELATIVE DISPERSION

Generally speaking, most ﬂows exhibit a range of scales over which ﬂuid motion is ex-

pected to display diﬀerent characteristics: a small-scale range where the velocity variations

can be considered as a smooth function of space variables; a range of intermediate lengths

corresponding to the coherent structures (and/or spatial ﬂuctuations) present in the veloc-

ity ﬁeld over which velocity variations are rough but highly correlated; a large-scale range

over which spatial correlations have deﬁnitely decayed.

In each of these ranges, relative

dispersion between trajectories is governed by a diﬀerent physical mechanism (chaos, turbu-

3

lence, diﬀusion) which can be, in principle, identiﬁed from the observations. In fully devel-

oped three-dimensional turbulence, motion is only smooth under the Kolmogorov dissipative

scale. In the free stratiﬁed atmosphere (above the planetary boundary layer), turbulence is

a relatively rare event: motion is most often smooth but for some localized convective or tur-

bulent events, associated with mesoscale systems, that mix momentum and tracers. Hence

one expects to ﬁnd a smooth (chaotic) dispersion range ended at a scale characteristic of

the spacing of mixing events, followed by a range covering the mesoscale to synoptic range,

and ﬁnally standard diﬀusion at planetary scale. This view is supported by the ubiquitous

observation of long-lived laminated structures in the free troposphere (Newell et al., 1999).

In order to ﬁx some terminology, we will use both symbols R and δ for indicating the

distance between balloons: the former will be considered as a quantity function of time, the

latter as an argument for scale-dependent functions.

where xi(t) and xj(t) are the i-th and j-th coordinates at time t, with i, j = 1, 2, 3. The

average operation

is meant to be performed over a large number of particles. The diagonal

hi

elements are just the diﬀusion coeﬃcients. When the Dii’s are ﬁnite, then the diﬀusion is

standard. This means that at long times, after the Lagrangian velocity correlations have

decayed (Taylor, 1921), the variance of the particle displacement follows the law:

(II.2)

In presence of a velocity ﬁeld characterized by coherent structures, it is more useful to

observe the relative dispersion between the trajectories, rather than the absolute dispersion

from the initial positions, given by (II.2), which is unavoidably dominated by the mean

advection.

In the case of the EOLE experiment, where observing the expansion of balloon clusters

with more than two elements is a rare event (ML) a measure of relative dispersion is given

4

by the mean square inter-particle distance:

averaged over all the pairs (x(m), x(n)), where m and n label all the available N trajectories.

Notice that the norm in (II.2) and (II.3) must be deﬁned accordingly to the geometry of the

ﬂuid domain, i.e. in the atmosphere we use the arc distance on the great circle of the Earth

connecting the two points. The quantity in (II.3) can be measured for both initially close

pairs, balloons released from the same place at short time delay, and so-called chance pairs,

balloons initially distant which come close to each other at a certain time and, later, spread

away again (ML). Consistency of the average in eq. (II.3) requires all the trajectory pairs

to have nearly the same initial distance, a condition which strongly limits the statistics. At

long times,

R(t)2

h

i

deﬁned in eq. (II.3) is expected to approach the function 4Dt, where the

4 factor accounts for relative diﬀusion. When it happens that

R(t)2

h

i ∼

t2ν with ν > 1/2,

instead, the Lagrangian dispersion is considered as super-diﬀusion. A well-known example

is the Richardson’s law for the particle pair separation in 3D turbulence, for which ν = 3/2

(Richardson 1926; Monin and Yanglom 1975).

On the other hand, in the limit of inﬁnitesimal trajectory perturbations, much smaller

than the characteristic lengths of the system, the evolution of the particle pair separation is

characterized by the Lyapunov exponent (Lichtenberg and Lieberman, 1982), such that

λ = lim
t→∞

(II.4)

If λ > 0 the growth is exponential and the motion is said chaotic. Chaos is a familiar

manifestation of non linear dynamics, leading to strong stirring of trajectories (Ottino, 1989).

The process, for example, of repeated ﬁlamention around the polar vortex is basically due to

Hamiltonian chaos (Legras and Dritschel, 1993). For ﬁnite perturbations within a smooth

ﬂow, the properties of exponential separation are observed for a ﬁnite time.

B. Finite-Scale Lyapunov Exponent

The idea of FSLE (Aurell et al. 1997; Artale et al. 1997), was formerly introduced

in the framework of the dynamical systems theory, in order to characterize the growth of

non-inﬁnitesimal perturbations (i.e. the distance between trajectories). If δ is the scale of

5

the perturbation, and

τ (δ)

is the mean time that δ takes to grow a factor r > 1, then the

FSLE is deﬁned as

The average operation is assumed to be performed over a large ensemble of realizations. For

i

factors r not much larger than 1, λ(δ) does not depend sensitively on r. If r = 2 then

i
is also called doubling time. Operatively, N + 1 scales are chosen to sample the spatial range

of perturbation, δ0 < δ1 < ... < δN , and a growth factor r is deﬁned such that δi = r

that the mean square particle distance must grow linearly in time, see (II.2). In general, if

the mean square size of a tracer concentration follows the

t2ν law, the FSLE scales as

scale. As a result, a physical situation which is well characterized in terms of FSLE, either

for scaling properties or the existence of transport barriers, may be less easily characterized

by studying the time growth of trajectory separation (Boﬀetta et al., 2000b; Joseph and

Legras, 2002). One reason is that

depends on contribution from diﬀerent regimes,

as seen, for example in 3D turbulence where a dramatic dependence of R2(t) upon R2(0) is

observed, even at very large Reynolds number (Fung et al., 1992)

In cases where advection is strongly anisotropic, e.g.

in presence of a structure like

the stratospheric jet stream, it may be useful to deﬁne the FSLE in terms of meridional

(cross-stream) displacement only:

λmer(δ(mer)) =

where δ(mer) is the latitude distance (or meridian arc) between two points.

function of the Lagrangian velocity diﬀerence and provides a complementary analysis to the

FSLE diagnostics. In particular, in the regime of Richardson’s super-diﬀusion, the expected

behavior for the FSRV is ν2(δ)

δ2/3.

III. ANALYSIS OF THE EOLE LAGRANGIAN DATA

After a preliminary data check, the number of balloons selected for the analysis has been

reduced to 382. This has been obtained by discarding ambiguous ident numbers (some ident

numbers have been used twice during the campaign), discarding trajectories that cross the

equator and short tracks of less than 10 points.

Successive points along a balloon trajectory were mostly recorded at a time interval of

10−1 day (2.4 hours), but the overall distribution of the raw data does not cover uniformly

the time axis. Hence, each of the coordinates (longitude and latitude) of every balloon

trajectory has been interpolated in time by a cubic spline scheme, with a sampling rate of

25 points per day. Because of possible data impurities, each Lagrangian velocity value is

monitored at every time step (0.04 day) and data segment with abnormally fast motions are

discarded.

As pointed out by ML, a way to measure the dispersion between balloons is waiting

for one of them to get close to another one, at a distance less than a threshold δ0, and

then observing the evolution of their relative distance in time. This procedure is repeated

for each balloon trajectory until the whole set of pairs is analyzed. The dataset includes

original pairs of balloons that were launched within a short time interval and chance pairs

of balloons meeting suddenly after a number of days. For the largest values of the threshold

7

used in this study, the number of chance pairs largely exceeds the number of original pairs. In

this way, global properties of the Lagrangian transport are extracted from the contributions

of balloon pairs randomly distributed all over the domain. The number of balloon pairs and

its evolution as the separation crosses the N scales deﬁned above is described by Table 1.

In Figure 1 four global relative dispersion curves are plotted, referring to four diﬀerent

initial thresholds δ0 = 25 km, 50 km, 100 km and 200 km. The statistical samples vary

roughly in proportional way with δ0. Relative dispersion depends sensitively, as expected,

on the initial conditions; the four curves meet together for separation larger than about

2500 km and saturation begins for separation larger than 4500 km, leaving room only for

a short standard diﬀusive regime between these two separations and over a time duration

of less than 10 days. The eddy diﬀusion coeﬃcient, DE, estimated by ﬁtting the linear law
4DEt, results in DE ≃
pre-diﬀusive regime is not very clear, we can say that the behavior of the balloon separation

2.9 106 m2s−1, a value compatible with what was found by ML. The

looks like a power law with exponent (changing in time) between 3 and 1.

We report in Figure 2 the mean logarithmic growth of the balloon relative separation

over all pairs selected by the threshold 25 km. At very short times (< 1 day) the slope

corresponds to an exponential growth rate with e-folding time

0.4 day that we consider as

≃

a rough estimate of the LLE. At later times, the slope gradually decreases as the separation

growth tends to a power law regime. In the same ﬁgure we also show the mean logarithmic

growth of the inter-balloon distance computed for two 4-element clusters (that we label as

’A’ and ’B’), launched with a time interval of 3 days between them. A linear behavior

(exponential growth) for both clusters is observed for short intervals; we observe as the

exponential regime lasts longer for the ’A’ cluster (

3 days) than for the ’B’ cluster (

1

≃

days). This illustrates the fact that the duration of a dispersion regime, here the chaotic

one, may exhibit large ﬂuctuations generally due to diﬀerent meteorological conditions. As a

result, average time-dependent quantities, like

, sample diﬀerent regimes at once and

are poor diagnostics of dispersion properties. Incidentally, in ML the behavior of the relative

dispersion between 100 and 1000 km is ﬁtted by means of an exponential with characteristic

e-folding time

2.7 days (see ML, ﬁgure 8), which is compatible with the growth rate of

≃

ﬁt it with an exponential curve branch.

Figure 3 shows the global FSLE relatively to the same four initial thresholds used for the

8

relative dispersion and setting the ampliﬁcation ratio r to √2. The main result of this study

is that up to about 1000 km there is evidence of Richardson’s super-diﬀusion, compatible

with a k−5/3 spectrum, displayed by the behavior λ(δ) = αδ−2/3. The best ﬁt is obtained

for the initial thresholds 100 and 200 km which encompass a much larger number of pairs

than smaller thresholds (see Table 1). The quantity α3 is physically related to the mean

relative kinetic energy growth rate (for unit mass) between balloons moving apart. Standard

diﬀusion is approached at scales larger than 2000 km. The value of the eddy diﬀusion

coeﬃcient is estimated by ﬁtting the FSLE in the diﬀusive range with (4 ln r)DEδ−2, as

shown in Boﬀetta et al. (2000a) by means of a dimensional argument. We ﬁnd that this
value is DE ≃
general behavior, except for obvious changes in the statistical samples.

Figure 4 shows global (mainly zonal) and meridional (λmer, see (II.7)) FSLE of the balloon

pairs with initial threshold 100 km. We ﬁnd that the dispersion is basically isotropic up

to scales of about 500 km, which is in rough agreement with the results of Morel and

Larchevˆeque (they give a value three times larger but their analysis, see their Fig. 7, does

not display a well-deﬁned cut-oﬀ). At scales larger than 500 km, the two components of the

FSLE decouple and the meridional dispersion rate follows the standard diﬀusion law
with a meridional eddy diﬀusion coeﬃcient DE ∼

106 m2s−1.

δ2/3, corresponding to the Richardson’s law;

asymptotic saturation sets in beyond this range (fully uncorrelated velocities).

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We have revisited the dispersion properties of the EOLE Lagrangian dataset using a

new approach, using Finite-Scale Lyapunov Exponent, that is better suited to analyze scale

dependent properties than standard tools that were used, e.g., by ML in a previous study of

the same dataset. We were motivated by the fact that ML found results supporting a k−3

∼

9

inertial range between 100 and 1000 km, whereas more recent studies based on aircraft data

found a k−5/3 behavior in the same range of scales.

Our main result of our improved analysis is that the EOLE dataset supports a k−5/3

behavior in the range 100-1000 km as shown by the scaling properties of FSLE in this range

indicating Richardson’s superdiﬀusion. At distances smaller than 100 km, our results suggest

an exponential separation with an e-folding time of about one day, in rough agreement with

ML. At scales larger 1000 km, the dispersion tends to a standard diﬀusion before saturating

at the planetary scale. Since the large-scale ﬂow is dominated by the meandering zonal

circulation, estimated diﬀusion coeﬃcient is 10 times larger for total dispersion (107 m2s−1)

than for meridional dispersion (106 m2s−1).

Our result is compatible with an inverse 2D energy cascade in the range 100-1000 km

or with the recently proposed alternative of a direct energy cascade (Lindborg and Cho,

2000). Our study of the EOLE experiment has shown that this still unparalleled dataset

of Lagrangian trajectories in the atmosphere is in agreement with results obtained from

aircraft data. The challenge is now to compare these trajectories with the global wind ﬁelds

produced by the recent reanalysis by operational weather centers.

thresholds: 25 km (a), 50 km (b), 100 km (c) and 200 km (d). All the curves but for 25

km have been shifted in time in order to collapse together for
h
diﬀusion coeﬃcient corresponding to the indicated slope is DE ≃

day. The two horizontal lines mark the range 100-1000 km (natural logarithm units). The

straight line ML is the result found by Morel and Larchvˆeque (1974) in their ﬁg. 8. Units:

time in days, R in km.

Figure 3. FSLE of the balloon pairs, four curves with the same four initial thresholds

as in Figure 1. The eddy diﬀusion coeﬃcient is DE ≃
the order of magnitude of the relative kinetic energy growth rate (for unit mass) between

107 m2s−1. The quantity α3 gives

balloons in the Richardson’s regime

δ−2/3. Units: δ in km, λ in day−1.

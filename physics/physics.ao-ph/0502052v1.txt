BEYERLE ET AL.: AN ANALYSIS OF REFRACTIVITY BIASES

Abstract.

An analysis of 156,180 atmospheric refractivity proﬁles ob-

served by the CHAMP geosatellite between 14 May 2001 and 18 July 2004

reveals signiﬁcant biases compared to ECMWF meteorological ﬁelds at al-

titudes below 5 km. The mean bias decreases down to −2% at altitudes be-

low 2 km. In order to separate bias contributions caused by critical refrac-

tion from contributions induced by deviations from spherical symmetry of

the atmospheric refractivity ﬁeld and the receiver tracking process a com-

prehensive end-to-end simulation study was performed. The simulations are

based on radio sonde proﬁles obtained regularly aboard research vessel ”PO-

LARSTERN” since December 1982. Within a subset of 2917 proﬁles recorded

on the Atlantic ocean at the latitudes ranging from 60◦S to 60◦N, in 1172 pro-

ﬁles (40.2%) vertical refractivity gradients below the threshold value of −157 km−1

are found. Critical refraction layers occur mainly between 1 to 2.5 km alti-

tude, above 3 km the occurrence of critical refraction can be disregarded. End-

to-end simulations including three signal tracking models were conducted on

the basis of refractivity ﬁelds derived from the sonde observations. The re-

sults conﬁrm that four quadrant carrier phase extraction outperforms the

two quadrant method currently implemented on CHAMP. Furthermore, within

regions of low signal-to-noise ratios an interesting alternative to ﬂy-wheeling

and open-loop tracking methods is bandwidth reduction of the receiver’s car-

rier tracking loop.

1. Introduction

Since March 2001 a Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation (RO) experi-

ment aboard the CHAMP (CHAllenging Minisatellite Payload) geosatellite [Reigber et al.,

2002, 2004] monitors atmospheric temperature and water vapor with high vertical res-

olution. The “BlackJack” GPS receiver aboard CHAMP records characteristic signal

amplitude and phase changes induced by the ionosphere and neutral atmosphere. From

the observed signal phase and amplitude the ray bending angle proﬁle α(p) and subse-

quently the atmospheric refractivity proﬁle N(z) = (n(z) − 1) · 106 are derived. Here,

n(z) denotes the real part of the atmospheric refractive index, p and z are the ray impact

parameter and the altitude, respectively. For the history and detailed accounts of the

radio occultation technique see e.g. Yunck et al. [2000]; Melbourne et al. [1994]; Kursinski

et al. [1997]; Hajj et al. [2002]. Between 14 May 2001 and 18 July 2004 CHAMP recorded

248,222 occultation events, 62.9% of which could be successfully processed and converted

to proﬁles of atmospheric temperature [Wickert et al., 2001, 2004; Hajj et al., 2004]. At

altitudes between about 7–8 km and 35 km good agreement between RO measurements

and meteorological analyses is found. In the lower troposphere, however, CHAMP val-

idation studies consistently report on a negative refractivity bias of more than several

percent [Wickert et al., 2004; Marquardt et al., 2003; Ao et al., 2003; Hajj et al., 2004].

This negative N-bias is well known from the proof-of-concept GPS/MET mission and was

ﬁrst described by Rocken et al. [1997] within the GPS/MET data validation study. In the

literature the N-bias is attributed to several factors. First, a vertical refractivity gradi-

ent below a threshold value of dNc/dz ≡ 106/rE ≈ −157 km−1 causes signal loss due to

D R A F T

critical refraction, with rE denoting the Earth radius [Ao et al., 2003; Sokolovskiy, 2003].

In occultation events aﬀected by critical refraction the Abel-retrieved refractivities are

systematically smaller than the true refractivities [Sokolovskiy, 2003]. Second, deviations

from spherical symmetry in the refractivity ﬁeld N(z) cause systematic deviations as well

[see e.g., Healy, 2001; Sokolovskiy, 2003]. Finally, the signal tracking process performed

by the GPS receiver may induce carrier phase errors further enhancing the refractivity

bias [see e.g., Gorbunov , 2002; Ao et al., 2003; Beyerle et al., 2003]. The purpose of this

study is to evaluate the individual contributions of these three phenomena on the basis of

observations and simulation results. To avoid the complexities of temperature and water

vapor retrieval [see e.g. Healy, 2001; Marquardt et al., 2001; Kursinski and Hajj , 2001] we

restrict the comparisons between CHAMP RO observations and meteorological analyses

to atmospheric refractivity. The occurrence of critical refraction within the marine tro-

posphere is investigated using an extensive data set of radio sonde observations collected

aboard research vessel ”POLARSTERN” and archived by Alfred Wegener Institute for

Polar and Marine Research (AWI). To distinguish the individual bias contributions, results

from numerous end-to-end simulations including several receiver tracking schemes were

performed and their results are discussed. The outline of the paper is as follows. First

the observational data sets, the “POLARSTERN” radio sonde data and the CHAMP RO

observations, are introduced. A discussion of the elements forming the end-to-end simula-

tion chain with particular emphasis on the receiver models follows. Finally, the CHAMP

refractivity observations and their deviation from meteorological analyses are interpreted

on the basis of simulation results.

2. Observational data sets

The focus of this study are two observational data sets: balloon-borne aerological sound-

ings performed by AWI since 1982 and CHAMP refractivity proﬁles covering the time

period between March 2001 and July 2004.

2.1. “POLARSTERN” radio sonde data

Starting in December 1982 the AWI

radio sonde data set comprises more

than 23,000 proﬁles observed aboard research vessel “POLARSTERN” at latitudes be-

tween 78.2◦S and 89.9◦N on the Atlantic ocean. Balloon-borne sondes measure temper-

ature, pressure and humidity data with a vertical resolution of about 20–50 m (corre-

sponding to 5–10 s sampling time at 4–5 m/s balloon rise velocity). Sounding aboard

“POLARSTERN” is performed with Vaisala RS80 radio sondes [Vaisala, 1989]. The

manufacturer quotes the following repeatabilities of calibration: 0.2–0.4◦C temperature

accuracy between −90◦C and +60◦C, 0.5 hPa pressure accuracy between 1060 hPa and

3 hPa and 2% RH relative humidity accuracy between 0 and 100% RH. At low temper-

atures it is known that the accuracy of the humidity measurements decreases further.

Fortunately, this has only a minor eﬀect on the derived water vapor partial pressure.

With very few exceptions [see e.g., von Engeln et al., 2003] critical refraction in the lower

troposphere is caused by strong vertical gradients induced by the water vapor ﬁeld; hu-

midity values at high latitudes are in general too low to produce critical refraction layers.

Thus, we focus in the following on a subset of 2917 sonde proﬁles recorded at mid and

low latitudes ranging from 60◦S to 60◦N. The corresponding launch dates cover the time

period between 29 December 1982 and 14 November 2003. Figure 1 shows the geograph-

ical locations of the corresponding sonde launches. Refractivity N is calculated from

with k1 = 0.7760 K/Pa, k2 = 0.648 K/Pa and k3 = 3.776 103 K2/Pa. Above the balloon

using a scale height of H = 7 km. In order to reduce the humidity sensor’s measurement

noise N(z) is linearly interpolated on an equidistant grid with 5 m resolution and smoothed

by a 50 m running mean ﬁlter. Then, N(z) and dN(z)/dz, for a given altitude z, are

(1)

(2)

calculated from a cubic spline ﬁt of the smoothed proﬁle.

2.2. CHAMP satellite observations

As of 18 July 2004 (day of year 200) 248,222 occultation events have been recorded

aboard CHAMP since activation of the operational occultation mode on 14 May 2001.

Out of these, 156,180 observations (62.9%) pass the quality criteria implemented in the op-

erational processing system and produce validated refractivity proﬁles. The latest version

of the occultation processor (version 5) uses the Full Spectrum Inversion (FSI) method

[Jensen et al., 2003] to retrieve bending angles at tropospheric altitudes. For a detailed

discussion of the data processing and analysis see Wickert et al. [2001, 2004]. The observed

CHAMP refractivity proﬁles are intercompared with meteorological analysis results pro-

vided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). ECMWF

pressure and temperature values are calculated by linear interpolation between grid points

(0.5◦ × 0.5◦ resolution). Linear interpolation in time is performed between 6 h ECMWF

D R A F T

BEYERLE ET AL.: AN ANALYSIS OF REFRACTIVITY BIASES

analyses ﬁelds. The comparison between RO observation and ECMWF is performed on

the 60 pressure levels provided by the ECMWF atmospheric model ranging from the

ground surface up to 0.1 hPa (about 60 km altitude). Within the altitude range relevant

for this study vertical spacing of the model grid points increases from about 200 m at 1 km

altitude to about 700 m at 10 km altitude. Negative biases in the lower troposphere are

well-known from CHAMP and other satellite RO missions [see e.g. Rocken et al., 1997; Ao

et al., 2003; Hajj et al., 2004]. Not surprisingly, the exact shape of the fractional refrac-

tivity error depends on the number of data points retrieved at a given altitude z, in the

following denoted by m(z); z50% refers to the altitude at which the number of successfully

retrieved data points is reduced to 50%. If e.g. more restrictive quality control criteria are

employed removing outlier observations, z50% would increase correspondingly. In order to

document this mutual dependence the proﬁle m(z) is always plotted in combination with

the fractional refractivity error ∆N/Ntrue ≡ (N − Ntrue)/Ntrue.

3. End-to-end simulations

Starting with a refractivity proﬁle N(z) the atmospheric propagation of a GPS signal

is modelled using the inverse FSI technique [Gorbunov , 2003; Gorbunov and Lauritsen,

2004]. The simulated amplitude and phase data are converted to bending angle proﬁles

with the FSI method [Jensen et al., 2003]. Finally, refractivity proﬁles are retrieved by

Abel-transforming the bending angle proﬁles thereby closing the simulation loop [Ao et al.,

2003]. The schematic of the end-to-end simulation chain is shown in Figure 2. Optionally,

a simpliﬁed signal receiver model can be inserted in the simulation processing chain.

For each receiver model 2917 simulation runs are performed using as refractivity ﬁelds the

“POLARSTERN” radio sonde proﬁles described in section 2.1. Statistical analyses of true

D R A F T

D R A F T

X - 8

BEYERLE ET AL.: AN ANALYSIS OF REFRACTIVITY BIASES

and retrieved refractivity proﬁles provide insight into systematic deviations introduced by

the individual simulation steps. For clarity and numerical eﬃciency the simulations are

simpliﬁed in a number of ways.

1. The GPS and LEO orbits are assumed to be coplanar and circular with radii of

rG = 26, 800 km and rL = 6800 km, respectively. Thus, FSI and inverse FSI are eﬃciently

implemented using the Fast Fourier Transform without the requirement of vacuum prop-

agation of the wave ﬁeld or the addition of phase correction terms [Jensen et al., 2003;

Gorbunov , 2003; Gorbunov and Lauritsen, 2004].

2. Since the optical path diﬀerence between interfering rays in multipath regions are

much smaller than the C/A code chip length of 300 m, code modulation can be ignored

for the purpose of the present study and is not taken into account [Beyerle et al., 2003].

The navigation data modulation, though, is implemented by random sign changes every

20 ms.

3. Doppler shifts and clock deviations related to special and general relativity are not

included in the simulation. For a detailed discussion see Ashby [2003].

4. Carrier tracking loops are assumed to perform frequency update only, phase update

loops are not considered [Stephens and Thomas, 1995].

5. Since this study is focused on altitudes below 10 km, signal propagation through the

ionosphere is neglected. Without dispersion we may ignore the L2 frequency channel and

the simulation is restricted to the single wavelength case.

3.1. Forward propagation

Atmospheric propagation of GPS signals is numerically simulated using the inverse FSI

technique [Gorbunov , 2003; Gorbunov and Lauritsen, 2004]. Since the spatial scales of

the atmospheric refractive index variations are much larger than the GPS signal wave-

length (19.03 cm at L1) backscattering can be ignored and the signal propagation is

determined by representing the continuous atmospheric medium by a sequence of parallel

phase screens. The derivation of signal amplitudes and phases for a given refractivity

proﬁle involves two steps. First, a bending angle proﬁle α(p) as a function of impact pa-

rameter p is determined within the geometrical optics approximation. Second, the inverse

FSI method yields the propagated signal from α(p). A detailed discussion can be found in

Gorbunov [2003]; Gorbunov and Lauritsen [2004]. In our implementation of the forward

model the wave ﬁeld is described by 20,000 rays propagating through 2001 plane-parallel

phase screens separated by ∆x = 1 km. At each phase screen the incident wave suﬀers a

phase shift whereas the wave’s amplitude remains unchanged; between screens the wave is

propagated through vacuum. At the ith phase screen the jth ray is deﬂected by an angle

∆α(j)

i (p) [Gorbunov et al., 1996]. The full bending angle then follows from the summation

αj(p) =

∆x .

Finally, the propagated complex signal is calculated from α(p) with the inverse FSI method

[Gorbunov , 2003; Gorbunov and Lauritsen, 2004]. The 50 Hz data modulation of the real-

valued signal u(t) is modelled as random sign changes every 20 ms, i.e.

u(t) ≡ D(t) AObs(t) cos(φ(t))

(4)

X - 10

BEYERLE ET AL.: AN ANALYSIS OF REFRACTIVITY BIASES

with amplitude AObs(t), phase φ(t) and data modulation D(t) = ±1 [Ao et al., 2003].

D(t) is taken to be piecewise constant for 20 ms. In order to account for deviations of

the refractivity ﬁeld from spherical symmetry [see e.g., Ahmad and Tyler , 1999; Healy,

2001; Sokolovskiy, 2003] the simulation runs are repeated with z(j)

i (p) in Eqn. 3 replaced

by z(j)

i (p) + δz(j)

i

. Heuristically, δz(j)

i

is taken to be

δz(j)

i = (Ka ν(j)

i + Kb µi) exp(−z(j)

i /Hw)

(5)

with Ka = 10 m and Kb = 10 m. ν(j)

i

and µi are Gaussian distributed random variables

with zero mean and unit standard deviation. Eqn. 5 is heuristically motivated by time

series of refractivity proﬁles extracted from the “POLARSTERN” sonde data. Fig. 3

exempliﬁes our heuristic approach with 10 refractivity proﬁles derived from soundings

on 26–27 October 1990 spaced by 4–6 hours. While in general the same overall structures

appear in all observations, small-scale variabilities between adjacent proﬁles are evident.

In particular, the disturbances at 1.5–2 km altitude appear to be shifted by several tens

of meters. The altitude-dependent contribution is qualitatively described by the term

Ka ν(j)
i

in Eqn. 5, the altitude-independent term by Kb µi. Finally, the non-spherical

contributions are assumed to decrease exponentially with the humidity scale height Hw =

2 km, since the disturbances shown in Fig. 3 are dominated by tropospheric humidity.

3.2. Receiver model

The receiver model tracks the signal by correlating u(t) with replica signals vI(t) ≡

cos(φN CO(t)) and vQ(t) ≡ − sin(φN CO(t)) yielding the inphase correlation sum I and

quadphase correlation sum Q, respectively. The replicas vI(t) and vQ(t) are produced by

the receiver’s numerically-controlled oscillators (NCO) [Kaplan, 1996; Tsui , 2000; Misra

and Enge, 2002]. The NCO’s frequency f N CO(t) is updated at a rate of 1/T = 1 kHz, i.e.

f N CO(t) is piecewise constant for tn ≤ t < tn +T , f N CO

≡ f N CO(tn). Provided the signal’s

In closed-loop mode the phase-locked loop (PLL) steers ΦR towards zero, i.e. |I| ≫ |Q| if

the tracking loop is locked to the signal. In open-loop (see section 3.2.3) mode, however,

received and replica signals are no longer phase-locked and ΦR may exceed the interval

[−180◦, +180◦]. Under these circumstances use of Eqn. 13 would introduce a cycle slip

whenever ΦR passes ±180◦. These cycle slips are removed by keeping track of the number

of full cycles C, i.e. Eqn. 13 is modiﬁed by

and C1 = 0. To prevent phase noise to erroneously introduce cycle slips, Cn remains un-

changed as long as the voltage signal-to-noise (SNRv) is below 40. In particular, Eqn. 14

should not be used in ﬂy-wheeling tracking mode since ﬂy-wheeling is restricted to low

SNRv (see section 3.2.4). In the current CHAMP occultation receiver design two-quadrant

phase extraction is implemented [Ao et al., 2003]. With two-quadrant phase extraction

the 50 Hz data modulation is automatically taken care of, since Eqn. 12 is insensitive with

respect to sign changes of I and Q [Kaplan, 1996]. With four-quadrant phase extraction

(Eqn. 13) sign changes add 180◦ to the residual phase. To avoid these half-cycle slips the

navigation data modulation has to be removed from the signal prior to tracking. Thus,

data demodulation or data wipe-oﬀ requires knowledge of the navigation message. We

comment on the feasibility of data wipe-oﬀ in appendix A.

mature loss of lock in closed-loop receivers [Sokolovskiy, 2001]. In open-loop mode the

loop feedback δfn+1 is calculated from a model proﬁle f (M ), i.e.

The true signal frequency f (t) can be retrieved without loss of information provided it

3.2.4. Fly-wheel mode tracking

The ﬁrst occultation measurements from the proof-of-concept GPS/MET mission fre-

quently suﬀered from loss of lock already in the upper or mid troposphere in particular at

low latitudes [Rocken et al., 1997]. To remedy this phenomenon the occultation receiver

group at Jet Propulsion Laboratory developed and implemented the ﬂy-wheeling tracking

method [Hajj et al., 2004]. Fly-wheeling mode was successfully used in later phases of

the GPS/MET mission and is the nominal tracking behavior on the CHAMP and SAC-C

satellites. Fly-wheel tracking is activated when SNRv drops below a predeﬁned thresh-

old value. Once activated, the tracking loop is opened and f N CO
n+1

is calculated from the

previous L values of the NCO frequency by extrapolating a second order polynomial ﬁt

through f N CO

n−L+1, . . . , f N CO

n

. Thus, during ﬂy-wheeling the carrier tracking loop is no longer

phase-locked to the signal u(t). The phasor I + i Q starts to rotate freely in I − Q space

eﬀectively randomizing the residual phase values and causing signiﬁcant phase errors.

However, signal loss is less likely during ﬂy-wheeling since large residual phase errors no

longer cause f N CO to sheer out. Our ﬂy-wheeling simulations show that the results de-

pend strongly on the selected ﬂy-wheeling parameters: the number of samples L included

in the polynomial ﬁt, the degree of the extrapolation polynomial, the SNRv threshold for

activation and deactivation, time delays inserted for activation, etc. In our implementa-

tion the following parameters were found to give best results: L = 2000 corresponding to

a time period of 2 s, a ﬁt polynomial of order two, a threshold value of SNRvth = 40 and

a 50 ms time delay. These parameters and the ﬂy-wheeling implementation in general,

however, should not be regarded as an accurate representation of the occultation receiver

aboard CHAMP.

3.3. Backward model

From the amplitudes Ak and phases Φk (Eqn. 11) bending angle proﬁles are derived

with the FSI technique [Jensen et al., 2003; Gorbunov and Lauritsen, 2004]. Finally, the

bending angle proﬁles α(p) are inverted back into refractivity proﬁles N(z) using the Abel

transform [Fjeldbo et al., 1971] thereby closing the simulation chain.

4. Analysis and discussion

4.1. Sonde and satellite observations

From the “POLARSTERN” in-situ measurements all 2917 soundings located between

60◦S and 60◦N latitude are selected and their vertical refractivity gradients are extracted.

The occurrence distribution of the smallest value of dN/dz is shown in Fig. 4. 40.2%

(1172 proﬁles) exhibit critical refraction with dN/dz < −157 km−1 (dashed line). Radio

sonde data represent point measurements without information on the horizontal extent

of the observed layers. As will be discussed below deviations from spherical symmetry

reduce the inﬂuence of critical refraction layers. Thus, the percentage estimate noted

above should be regarded as an upper limit for the occurrence of critical refraction in

the marine environment at low and mid latitudes. The probability for the occurrence

of critical refraction as a function of altitude can be deduced from Fig. 5 showing the

altitude distribution of the highest layer obeying dN/dz < −157 km−1. Fig. 5 suggests

that critical refraction is a phenomenon restricted to the planetary boundary layer (PBL)

at altitudes below 2–2.5 km. Above 3 km critical layers are unlikely to occur. A subset of

17,274 CHAMP observations over the Atlantic ocean retrieved at 60◦S–60◦N latitude and

45◦W–15◦E longitude is shown in Fig. 6. In the left panel the corresponding mean and

standard deviation of the fractional refractivity error with respect to ECMWF analyses

are plotted. Whilst above 4 km the retrieved RO data are almost bias-free, in the PBL

CHAMP observations and ECMWF analyses diﬀer by up to −2%. Only 50% of the

proﬁles reach atmospheric layers below 1.98 km altitude (right panel).

4.2. End-to-end simulations

BEYERLE ET AL.: AN ANALYSIS OF REFRACTIVITY BIASES

X - 17

The task of interpreting Fig. 6 is approached by a series of end-to-end simulation runs

in which the individual bias contributions are studied studied separately. The simulation

results are presented in Figs. 7–14. All plots show the mean fractional diﬀerence be-

tween retrieved and true refractivity in the left panel (thick solid lines). Thin lines mark

the one-sigma standard deviation. In addition, the number of retrieved data points as

function of altitude is given as well (right panel). The simulation results excluding the

receiver module (ideal receiver case) with a spherically symmetric atmosphere is plotted

in Fig. 7. Excluding those refractivity values which are aﬀected by critical refraction

an almost bias-free result is obtained (dashed lines). The number of data points de-

crease accordingly (right panel, dashed line). The remaining deviation and in particular

the non-vanishing standard deviation below 3 km are caused by proﬁles with refractivity

gradients approaching but not exceeding the threshold dNc/dz. Due to the simulations’

ﬁnite vertical and horizontal resolution these strong gradients cause retrieval errors on

the order of 0.1%. Breaking the spherical symmetry of the atmospheric refractivity ﬁeld

renders the lowest few hundred meters almost inaccessible and introduces a signiﬁcant

negative bias in the few proﬁles still reaching the PBL (Fig. 8). Comparison of the re-

sults including and excluding critical refraction (solid and dashed lines) suggests that for

a non-spherical atmosphere critical refraction is of minor importance. Simulation results

for four diﬀerent signal tracking models are discussed: closed-loop tracking with 30 Hz

loop bandwidth and ﬂy-wheeling capability (model B), open-loop tracking (model C) and

closed-loop detection without ﬂy-wheeling and a reduced carrier loop bandwidth of 5 Hz

(model D). The fourth model is the ideal receiver case already discussed (model A). The

model characteristics are summarized in Table 1. For each model simulation runs with

D R A F T

February 20, 2014, 5:30pm

D R A F T

X - 18

BEYERLE ET AL.: AN ANALYSIS OF REFRACTIVITY BIASES

spherical (Figs. 7, 9, 11 and 13) and non-spherical (Figs. 8, 10, 12 and 14) refractivity

ﬁeld are performed. The ﬂy-wheeling receiver appears to be unable to penetrate layers

of critical refraction as indicated by the close agreement between dashed and solid lines

in Figs. 9 and 10. Furthermore, the qualitative agreement between simulation (Fig. 10)

and the CHAMP observation (Fig. 6) suggests that the negative bias observed within the

CHAMP data set below 2 km is dominated by contributions related to deviations from

spherical symmetry. Above 2–3 km, on the other hand, receiver-induced errors have an

impact on the bias, since the occurrence of critical refraction above 3 km can be excluded

and the mean, as well as the standard deviations plotted in Figs. 9 and 10 approxi-

mately agree in the free troposphere. Our interpretation is substantiated by simulation

results for receiver model C (Figs. 11 and 12) and D (Figs. 13 and 14) which exhibit

a signiﬁcantly smaller standard deviation of the fractional refractivity error in particular

above 6 km in comparison to the ﬂy-wheeling receiver (model B). Not surprisingly, the

open-loop receiver performs best with respect to the number of retrieved data points (left

panels in Figs. 11 and 12). This comes at the price of a strong positive bias at altitudes

below 1 km in the case of a non-spherical troposphere (Fig. 12). As a viable alternative

to open-loop appears closed-loop tracking with carrier loop bandwidth reduced from 30

to 5 Hz. The smaller bandwidth eﬀectively renders the PLL more robust against phase

noise; the phase variations characterizing regions of multipath propagation are recorded

in suﬃcient resolution by the residual phase. Figs. 13 and 14 show the corresponding

fractional refractivity errors. Whilst the number of retrieved proﬁles is less compared

to the open-loop retrievals (Figs. 11 and 12), the results exhibit better agreement with

the ideal receiver case (Figs. 7 and 8) in terms of mean and standard deviation of the

fractional retrieval error.

5. Outlook and conclusions

The large size of the CHAMP occultation data set allows now to proceed beyond the

statistical analyses of zonal or global averages such as plotted in Fig. 6. First investiga-

tions of the global map of fractional refractivity errors between CHAMP and ECMWF

reveal complex zonal and meridional structures. In Fig. 15 possible contributions from

critical refraction are excluded by restricting the analysis to the mid troposphere. The

156,180 proﬁles of the fractional refractivity deviation between CHAMP and ECMWF

are integrated over 3–5 km altitude and sorted in 10◦ × 10◦ longitude/latitude bins. On

average each bin is ﬁlled with 232.2 ± 78.7 observations. At high latitudes the fractional

refractivity error remains below ±0.3%, at mid and low latitudes the bias reaches about

−1% on a global scale. The geographical distribution, however, exhibits pronounced pat-

terns with small and medium-scale biases exceeding +1% over South America and −2%

over the eastern tropical Paciﬁc. Whilst the negative bias is consistently explained by

receiver-induced errors and deviations from spherical symmetry in regions of high hu-

midity, the causes for the observed positive biases remain unclear and are the subject of

further study. Convective activity might contribute to positive biases; however, system-

atic deviations of ECMWF analyses from the true atmospheric state cannot be ruled out.

In conclusion we ﬁnd from an analysis of 2917 radio soundings over the Atlantic ocean

that critical refraction is restricted to the PBL at altitudes below 3 km. Within the PBL

critical refraction is a frequent phenomenon with more than 40% of the observed vertical

refractivity gradient passing the threshold value of −157 km−1. Simulation results involv-

ing a ﬂy-wheeling capable receiver reproduce qualitatively the negative refractivity bias

exhibited by CHAMP. Two advanced tracking schemes, open-loop tracking and closed-

loop tracking with reduced loop bandwidth, are found to improve the retrieval results

in the mid and lower troposphere at altitude below 6-8 km both, in terms of bias and

standard deviation.

Appendix A: A note on the feasibility of data wipe-oﬀ

It was noted that signal tracking using four-quadrant phase extraction requires knowl-

edge of the 50 Hz data bit in order to demodulate the signal. Here, we brieﬂy discuss the

feasibility of this approach. The navigation message is organized in frames of 1500 bit

transmitted during 30 s. Each frame consists of ﬁve 300 bit subframes [Kaplan, 1996].

Subframes 1 to 3 repeat every 30 s, subframes 4 and 5 change 25 times increasing the

repetition interval to 12.5 min. Since to the best of our knowledge the navigation data bits

are not available to the public prior to transmission, demodulation has to be performed

with predicted navigation data bits D(p). A receiver capable of data wipe-oﬀ outputs

D(p) in addition to phase and amplitude data. In post-processing D(p) is compared to

the true data bits D and those occultation events recorded with a wrong prediction are

ﬂagged and removed from data set. In order to obtain an estimate on the predictability

of Dn, one week of GPS data recorded by a modiﬁed GPS receiver at GeoForschungsZen-

trum Potsdam (52.38◦N, 13.07◦E) was analyzed. From 13 June to 19 June 2004 (GPS

week number 1275) the instrument recorded the navigation messages of all 28 active GPS

satellites. In total 676,873 subframes were recorded. For the analysis we assume that the

53 diﬀerent types of subframes (subframes 1–3 and 25 versions of subframe 4 and 5) remain

constant with a repeat cycle of 12.5 min except for the time information (time-of-week

count message) [Kaplan, 1996; Tsui , 2000]. The predicted time tag in the second word

of each subframe is obtained by incrementing the time-of-week count message. With this

simple method 664,717 subframe are predicted correctly; i.e., less than 2% of the subframe

predictions (12,156 out of 676,873) turn out to be wrong.

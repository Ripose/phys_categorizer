Abstract

We report on the inﬂuence of submerged bubble clouds on the remote sensing properties
of water. We show that the optical effect of bubbles on radiative transfer and on the estimate
of the ocean color is signiﬁcant. We present a global map of the volume fraction of air in
water derived from daily wind speed data. This map, together with the parameterization of the
microphysical properties, shows the possible signiﬁcance of bubble clouds on the albedo of
incoming solar energy.

1 Introduction

“The effect of bubbles on the color of the sea may be observed in breaking waves... Where a
great many bubbles have been entrained by a breaking wave it is white. But where there are
fewer of them it is blue-green or green, brighter than the sea but not as bright as the foamiest
parts of the wave. Even after a wave has broken and the water is again quiescent, a pastel
green patch often remains, slowly fading into the surrounding sea as the bubbles dissipate.
Thus the effect of bubbles on the color of the sea is similar to that of solid particles (Bohren,
1987).” Bubbles within the water and foam on its surface (Bukata, 1995; Frouin et al., 1996;

1

Stramski, 1994) can predominate in determining the radiative transfer properties of the sea sur-
face at higher wind speeds. However, there is a limited knowledge about the radiative transfer
properties of bubble clouds, their inherent optical properties (IOP), and their global climatol-
ogy. Mobley (1994) and Bukata (1995) discuss qualitatively the surface properties of bubble
clouds. Frouin et al. (1996) performed spectral reﬂectance measurements of sea foam at the
Scripps Institution of Oceanography Pier. They observed a decrease of the foam reﬂectance
in the near-infrared and proposed that the foam reﬂectance can not be decoupled from the ref-
electance by bubbles. Stramski (1994) concentrates on light scattering by submerged bubbles
in quiescent seas and shows the scattering coefﬁcient and the backscattering coefﬁcient at 550
nm in comparison with scattering and backscattering coefﬁcients of sea water as estimated
from the chlorophyll-based bio-optical models for Case 1 waters. In this exploratory paper, we
report on the inﬂuence of bubble clouds generated by breaking waves on the remote sensing re-
ﬂectance and calculate not only the inherent optical, but also apparent optical properties using
the radiative transfer model. We show that the optical effects of bubbles on remote sensing of
the ocean color are signiﬁcant. Furthermore, we present a global map of volume fraction of air
in water. This map, together with the parameterization of the microphysical properties, shows
the signiﬁcance of bubble clouds on the global albedo of incoming solar energy. By proxy, we
show the inﬂuence of the bubble clouds on the remote sensing retrieval of organic and inor-
ganic components of the natural waters. It is worth mentioning that the bubble clouds coincide
with the upper range of the euphotic zone and will, therefore, contribute to the dynamics of
the upper-ocean boundary layer, heat distribution, and sea surface temperature (Thorpe et al.,
1992).
In fact, our initial motivation for this work was an observation that the asymptotic
radiance distribution is established close to the ocean surface in apparent contradiction with
theoretical studies (Flatau et al., 1999). Thus, the light ﬁeld must become diffuse at shallower
depths than usually modeled. This leads to search for alternative mechanisms inﬂuencing the
light distribution. Thus, the importance to light scattering of the bubble clouds goes beyond
the remote sensing issues considered in this work.

In the next section, we discuss in more detail the microphysical and morphological prop-
erties of bubble clouds, because they have a direct bearing on their optical properties and
radiative transfer.

2 Physical properties of bubble clouds

2.1 Morphology of bubble clouds in natural waters
Individual bubble clouds are generated by breaking waves, persist for several minutes (Thorpe,
1995), and reach to mean depths of about 4Hs, where Hs is the signiﬁcant wave height, but
with some clouds extending to about 6Hs. There is evidence that at high wind speeds, sepa-
rate bubble clouds near the surface coalesce, producing a stratus layer (Thorpe, 1995). Fig 1
is based on a sonograph of Thorpe (1984). The “bubble-stratocumulus” (b-Sc) is often ob-
served by acoustic means (Farmer and Lemon, 1984; Thorpe, 1995). The depth of the b-Sc
layer is related to the wind speed and wind variability, but more speciﬁcally it is set by larger
waves, such us those breaking predominantly in groups (Thorpe, 1995). The “stratus layer”
description should not be taken too literally. For sufﬁciently high winds there will be signiﬁ-

2

cant concentrations through out the upper layer, but the variability within this layer can be very
high.

Figure 1: Bubble-stratocumulus (b-Sc) layer generated by breaking waves with inhomogeneous
deeper intrusions. The depth of the cloud is related to the maximum signiﬁcant wave height.

2.2 Bubble cloud climatology
According to Thorpe et al. (1992) in the absence of precipitation and in wind speeds exceeding
about 3 m s−1, wave breaking generally provides the dominant source of bubbles. The wind
speed W10 at 10 m above the mean sea surface level is used to parameterize the volume frac-
tion of air in water, f = Vair/Vw, where Vair is the volume of air, and Vw is the volume of
water. This parameterization is an approximation of a more complex wind-wave relationship.
Figure 2 shows the volume fraction of air in water estimated from the W10 winds for January of
1992. The volume fraction and the wind speed are assumed to follow a non-linear relationship
(Walsh and Mulhearn, 1987)

f = f0W 4.4

10 + f1

(1)

The coefﬁcients f0 and f1 were calculated at 2m assuming that f= 10−8 for W10 = 6.2m s−1
and f= 10−7 for W10 = 10.5m s−1 (Walsh and Mulhearn, 1987). Vagle and Farmer (1992)
show that the volume fraction decreases with depth, changing from about 10−6 at 0.3 m to
10−7 at 2.7 m. We base our parameterization on these ﬁndings and extrapolate (1) to near-sea-
surface depth using exponential ﬁt.

The monthly averages of f were obtained by employing 1992 daily surface winds from
the NCAR/NCEP (Kalnay et al., 1996) reanalysis project, and averaging the daily volume
fractions for each month. Thus, Figure 2 is based on the variability of the wind ﬁeld on the
scale of one day. In the winter of the northern hemisphere, one can observe maxima associated
with the midlatitude storm tracks in the Northern Paciﬁc. Cyclogenesis, common in western
parts of the oceans during the winter, contributes to mixing and a large bubble cloud volume
fraction. This can be observed to the east of the North American continent. The Intertropical
Convergence Zone (ITCZ) region, with its associated deep convection, may also be a region
of enhanced production of bubbles. The winds of the Southern Ocean have a strong effect on
bubble formation during both summer and winter. In subtropical regions, to the west of the
continents, the subsidence associated with the descending branch of the Hadley circulation is

responsible for the relative minimum in f . It should be stressed that these results are qualitative
and that they can be improved by more detailed breaking wave climatology models (Kraus and
Businger, 1994). The data in Fig 2 is indicative of regions where bubble clouds are potentially
important in the interpretation of remotely sensed reﬂectance.

2.3 Optical thickness
The size distribution of bubble clouds determines the optical thickness and is, therefore, one of
the most critical parameters entering the theory. There are two assumptions which simplify the
development here: (a) we consider light scattering in the geometric optics regime for which the
ratio proportional to bubble radius to wavelength x = 2πr/λ is large and (b) we assume that
there is an effective radius reﬀ which determines the optical properties of the size distribution.
Both (a) and (b) are quite probable. The size parameter, x = 50, corresponding to a bubble
radius of approximately 5 µm, is already in the geometric optics regime, and reﬀ = 10µm
will satisfy (a). For bubbles with an effective radius of reﬀ, the volume attenuation (equal to
scattering for a non-absorbing sphere) can be expressed as

Thus

(3)

where s = πr2 is the cross-section of a bubble with radius r, v is the volume of such a bubble.
N is the number of bubbles in volume Vw of water and f is the fraction of air in a volume of
water. The effective radius is deﬁned as reﬀ = v/s (Stephens et al., 1990; King et al., 1993;
Bricaud and Morel, 1986). Scattering efﬁciency deﬁnes how much of incoming light is being
“blocked” by a particle by scattering processes, for large size parameters Qsca tends to 2. This
issue is discussed in detail by Bohren and Huffman (1983).

The physical signiﬁcance of f comes from the fact that it is determined by the large scale
forcing such as the wind ﬁeld. Thus, for a given synoptic or climatological setting, the mixing
ratio f is, to some extent, pre-determined. On the other hand, the effective radius reﬀ depends
on processes of much smaller scale then the large scale. These processes are coagulation,
coalescence, coating by organic material, saturation, buoyancy, pressure, etc. Thus, Eq. 3 de-
ﬁnes the optical properties of bubble clouds on both the large- and sub-scales. The expression
b = 2f /reﬀ holds for polydispersions, and the only difference with a monodispersion is that
reﬀ is deﬁned via distribution averaged s and v.

2.4 Effective radius of the size distribution
Numerous observations of bubble size distributions are reported in the literature based on
acoustic, photographic, optical, and holographic methods (Wu, 1988a). Akulichev and Bu-
lanov (1987) summarize results from 22 experiments using different techniques. As the ori-
gins of bubbles are biological (within the volume and at the bottom), as well as physical (at the
rough surface), we may expect large regional and temporal variations of bubble concentration

5

between coastal and open oceanic waters and between plankton bloom or no-bloom conditions
(Thorpe et al., 1992).

Figure 3 presents a comparison of bubble spectra under breaking waves and quiescent sea.
Recently published observations, using laser holography near the ocean surface, have shown
that the densities of 10 to 15µm radius bubbles can be as high as 106 (per cubic meter per
micron radius increment) within 3 m of the surface of quiescent seas (O’Hern et al., 1988).
These results are plotted as solid squares connected with a vertical solid line. The majority of
bubbles injected into the surface layers of natural waters is unstable, either dissolving due to
enhanced surface tension and hydrostatic pressures or rising to the air-water interface where
the bubbles break (Johnson and Wangersky, 1987). However, bubbles with long residence
times, i.e. stable microbubbles, have been observed. For example Medwin (1977) observed
nearly 2.5 × 106of bubbles per cubic meter in the radius range 18 − 355 µm for small wind
speeds. One of the stabilization mechanisms (Mulhearn, 1981; Johnson and Wangersky, 1987)
assumes that the surfactant material is a natural degradation product of chlorophyll, present
in almost all photosynthesizing algae. Isao et al. (1990) have observed very large populations
of neutrally buoyant particles with radii between 0.1 − 1µm. Johnson and Wangersky (1987)
and Thorpe et al. (1992) proposed another stabilization mechanism based on monolayers of
adsorbed particles. Numerical modeling (Thorpe et al., 1992) can be used to study the effects
of water temperature, dissolved gas saturation levels, and particulate concentrations on the size
distribution of subsurface bubbles. The results of such numerical models provide additional
evidence for the existence of a small size bubble fraction which is not adequately measured by
acoustic or photographic techniques. The dashed line on Fig. 3 presents the mean concentra-
tion in the model steady-state for the water temperature of 0C. It can be seen that maximum
concentration is around 15µm and it is 2.5 orders of magnitude larger than for 100µm bubbles.
Other results presented (Figure 3) are those of Johnson and Cooke (1979) observations at 4m
in wind speed 11-13m s−1 (open squares). In situ acoustic measurements of microbubbles
at sea by Medwin (1977) are plotted as solid triangles. The solid triangles joined by a solid
line are concentrations at 4m depth and 3.3ms−1 wind speed. These spectra were obtained on
August 7, 1975 in Monterey Bay. The solid triangles are for midafternoon, February 10-16,
1965 at Mission Bay, San Diego, 3m below the surface, and in 1.7-2.8m s−1 winds. The open
triangles are from Baldy (1988) and include data at 30cm depth with wind and swell and at
25cm with wind only. They are based on extensive laboratory experiments. The solid hexagons
are data from Medwin and Breitz (1989) acoustic measurements obtained in the open sea at
25cm depth under the water surface during 12m s−1 winds under spilling breakers. The lit-
erature reviewed here and encapsulated in Figure 3 is a mixture of descriptions of the effect
of active wave breaking, and of stabilised microbubbles observed largely in coastal situations.
Currently, it is not clear how to parameterise the stabilized bubbles. From results such as those
presented in Fig. 3 in the case of “transient,” open ocean bubbles, it can be estimated that
the size distribution follows the power law dependence n(r) ∝ r−a and a ≈ 4 (Walsh and
Mulhearn, 1987; Wu, 1988a). Even though small microbubbles may not contribute to the total
mass, they may be important for the light scattering. Therefore, it is of interest to estimate
the contribution of small bubbles to the optical thickness. Assuming that microbubbles are
spherical (Vair = 4/3πr3N) we can show that the optical thickness (τ = bh) of a layer with
geometrical thickness h is

b ∝ hV 2/3

air N 1/3

(Johnson and Cooke, 1979) observations at 4m in wind speed 11-13m s−1.

Both h and Vair are assumed to be ﬁxed. It can be seen from Eq. 4 that the contribution to
optical thickness by very small particles will be the same as that by very large particles if their
concentration varies as N 3 (or steeper). Indeed is the case (Walsh and Mulhearn, 1987; Wu,
1988a).

What remains to be deﬁned is the effective radius reﬀ. On the basis of measurements,
estimates of small particle fraction, existence of background 1µm microbubbles, modeling
predictions, and steep slope of microbubble size distributions, we decided to use reﬀ = 10µm
as a typical “radiative response radius.” This choice does not exclude existence of larger or
smaller particles. The real value may be between 1µm for stabilized particles and 50µm for
the open ocean and will depend on many environmental factors such as storm passage, wind
speed, swell, wind variability, phytoplankton concentration, water temperature, gas saturation,
and other properties. The 10-15 fold increase in the size of effective radius or similar decrease
in the air volume fraction will reduce the importance of air bubbles to a very small effect.
It may be instructive to calculate the scattering coefﬁcient b for typical size distribution of
bubbles in water. In such case we have

b = Z Qscaπr2 dN (r)

Vw

(5)

or b = 2f s/v where s = R πr2dN (r) and v = R 4/3πr3dN (r), and dN (r) is the number of
bubbles between r and r + dr in a volume of water Vw. For typical size distribution of bubbles
in water dN (r)/dr ∝ 1/r4 we have

reﬀ =

4
3

ln(r1/r0)/(cid:18) 1

r0

−

1

r1(cid:19)

(6)

Consider r1 = 150 and r0 = 10 micrometers. This gives reﬀ ∼ 3.6r0 which shows that the
choice of small bubble cut-off is important for the bubbles’ optical properties. However, the
choice of this cutoff is non-trivial because the spectrum of small bubbles is not understood well
at present.

We close this section with some general comment about the effective radius.

It is not
a directly measurable quantity and, in essence, it deﬁnes how dispersed the given amount of
mass is. Scattering of incoming solar radiation is sensitive to total projected surface rather than
to total mass. For this reason the effective radius is commonly used in radiation calculations.
However, it should be stressed that the effective radius is a semi-inherent optical property
because it carries information not only about the size itself, but also about the orientation of
particles, their morphology, coating, size distribution, or departure from a spherical shape. In
addition, estimates of effective radius, as used in satellite remote sensing, often contain bias
due to unrealistic assumptions about other optical properties such as optical thickness, leakage
of photons due to horizontal transfer, wavelengths, or technique employed in retrieval. In that
sense the effective radius is also used (or abused) as a semi-apparent optical property.

3 Results

3.1 Numerical model
The numerical radiative transfer model used in this study is a slightly modiﬁed version of the
Hydrolight 3.0 code (Mobley, 1994; Mobley et al., 1994). In brief, this model computes from
ﬁrst principles the radiance distribution within, and leaving, any plane-parallel water body.
Input to the model consists of the absorbing and scattering properties of the water body, the
nature of the wind-blown sea surface and of the bottom of the water column, and the sun and
sky radiance incident on the sea surface.

Pure sea water absorption and scattering coefﬁcients are determined from the data of Pope
and Fry (1997). 35 model wavebands were speciﬁed to cover the 400-700 nm region with a
typical resolution of 10nm. The water column was speciﬁed as inﬁnitely deep. Up to 62 depth
layers, extending to 50 meters, were speciﬁed with a resolution of 0.5 m close to the surface.
A clear sky was assumed, but the diffuse sky radiance was included. Three or four component
systems were considered, consisting of pure water, particulates with or without bubble clouds,
and dissolved organic matter. The spectral absorption of dissolved organic matter was deﬁned
as

a(λ) = a(λ0) exp[−0.014(λ − λ0)]

(7)

where a(λ0) = 0.1 m−1, λ0 = 440 nm (Bricaud et al., 1981). The phase function of phyto-
plankton was deﬁned as an average of Petzold’s clear ocean, coastal ocean, and turbid harbor
cases (Mobley, 1994; Tyler, 1977). The bubble cloud phase function was calculated for the
real relative refractive index m = 0.75 as an average for the size parameter range between
x = 100 − 300 with a resolution ∆x = 1 using Wiscombe (Fiedler-Ferrari et al., 1991) code.
Figure 4 compares Petzold and bubble phase functions. The main reason for the size distri-
bution average was to remove transient spikes. This normalized phase function is scaled by b
calculated from Eq. 3. The volume scattering and absorption coefﬁcients for particulates were
determined from the Gordon-Morel model (Mobley, 1994; Gordon and Morel, 1983; Morel,
1988)

aCase1(λ) = [aw(λ) + 0.06a⋆

c (λ)C 0.65][1 + 0.2 exp(−0.014(λ − 440))]

Here aw(λ) is the absorption coefﬁcient of pure water, a⋆
c is the chlorophyll-speciﬁc absorption
coefﬁcient, and C is the chlorophyll concentration in mg m−3 (Mobley, 1994). The chloro-
phyll concentration was set as constant (well-mixed) with depth and equal to 0.8mg m−3 or
0.08mg m−3. We used Case 1 water parameterization but assumed that not all dissolved or-
ganic material is correlated with the chlorophyll concentration. In an apparent contradiction,
the wind speed which deﬁned surface reﬂectance and transmittance functions due to the wind-
blown water surface was set to 0. The reason for this was to estimate the effect on remote
sensing properties of the sub-surface bubble clouds. However, we investigated the sensitivity
of the reﬂectance to change in the wind speed between 0 and 10 ms−1, and the effect was
small compared to the inﬂuence of bubbles. The azimuth direction was divided into 24 equally
spaced sectors, the zenith-nadir range was divided into 20 equally spaced sectors. The proﬁle
of the bubble cloud volume fraction was determined by the expression

f (z) = f0(f1/f0)p

where f0 = f (z0) = 10−6, f1 = f (z1) = 10−7, z0 = 0 m, z1 = 8 m, and p = (z − z0)/(z1 −
z0). Our choice of the speed of attenuation is perhaps unreasonably gradual, except for the
case of stable microbubbles. On the other hand this choice is of secondary importance for the
remote sensing properties of bubble clouds which are dominated by the surface volume frac-
tion. In-water asymptotic light ﬁeld is discussed by Flatau et al. (1999). The scattering was
conservative. The volume attenuation was determined from the asymptotic expression (3). The
probability distribution function for scattering was discretized and was set as constant through-
out the depth range. We calculated the asymmetry parameter to be g ≈ 0.85. This parameter
deﬁnes the probability of photon scattering towards the forward or backward hemisphere. It is
equal to 1 if all photons are scattered forward and to -1 if all photons are scattered backward.

3.2 Remote sensing reﬂectance
The reference model runs were performed with the 3 component system of phytoplankton,
pure water, and DOM with a constant chlorophyll proﬁle. Two cases were computed (but only
one is presented), representative of clear coastal (C = 0.8) and oceanic (C = 0.08) water. The
remote sensed reﬂectance is deﬁned as

Rrs(λ) =

Lw(λ)
Ed(λ)

(11)

where Ed is the downwelling irradiance onto the sea surface, and Lw(λ) is the upwelling
water-leaving radiance. The remote-sensing radiance is a measure (Mobley, 1994) of how
much of the downwelling light that is incident onto the water surface is returned into the zenith
direction. The remote sensing reﬂectances are plotted in Fig. 5. The physical importance of
the remote-sensing reﬂectance is evident from asymptotic theories which relate Rrs to inherent
optical properties (Zaneveld, 1995)

Rrs ∝

β(π − θm)

a

(12)

where β is the phase function, θm is related to the sun zenith angle, and a is the absorp-
tion coefﬁcient. Thus, Rrs is approximately proportional to the probability of back- or side-
scattering, and inversly proportional to the absorption of water column. Figure 5 shows the
remote-sensing reﬂectance for the 3- and 4-component system with and without ocean bubbles
but with constant pigment amount. The total single scattering albedo is strongly inﬂuenced
by scattering from air bubbles. This leads to enhanced reﬂectance at all wavelengths. The
results for C = 0.08 (not presented) show even larger sensitivity. In Fig 5 the gray rectangles
indicate bands (wavelenghts) which are used by the current ocean color satellite instrument
(SeaWiFS). It is of interest to comment on the remote sensing of pigments and bubble cloud
retrievals. Consider an algorithm based on the ratio of remote-sensing reﬂectance and deﬁne
the ratio of remote-sensing reﬂectances without (Chl) and with (Chl+b) microbubbles as

ratio(λ) = RChl

rs /RChl+b

rs

.

(13)

Figure 6 shows ratio(λ). Performance of the pigment algorithms based on the ratio of re-
ﬂectances will depend on ratio(λ1)/ratio(λ2). Submerged microbubble clouds seem to be

11

wavelength-selective and even the ratio algorithms may require slight systematic correction.
Given the increased sensitivity of the current generation of ocean color instruments, the ab-
solute value of the radiances at the top of the atmosphere can be used for pigment retrievals.

4 Summary

Our calculations indicate that the optical effects of submerged microbubbles on the remote
sensing reﬂectance of the ocean color are signiﬁcant. These results are of importance for the
retrievals of pigments from the ocean color measurements and for studies of the energetics of
the ocean mixed layer. We provide information on how to reduce the systematic error due to
microbubbles in pigment retrieval schemes via the ratio(λ). We also derive apparent optical
property of bubbles - remote sensing reﬂectance - for the whole solar spectrum. This AOP
is directly observable by the satellites and remote sensors. We expect that these and similar
AOPs will have to be invoked in the case of hyperspectral retrievals for Case 2 waters where the
signals from minerals, bubbles, chlorophyll, and dissolved organic material (CDOM) are not
well correlated. New algorithms for current satellite instruments such as MODIS and SeaWIFS
should employ this information.

We also present a global map of the volume fraction of air in water derived from daily wind
speed data. We expect that such a map can be improved by knowing the day-to-day variability
of the wind-wave relationship and better estimates of the volume fraction.

The paper is exploratory. Therefore, it is perhaps worth playing advocatus diaboli and
speculate why the bubble clouds may not be important, at least in current satellite ocean color
retrieval practice. Here are some reasons: (1) The high wind and clouds are correlated. This
masks (bias) the effect of bubbles as observed from the satellites; (2) Both whitecaps (Wu,
1988b; Gordon and Wang, 1994; Frouin et al., 1996) and bubble clouds are correlated via their
dependence on wind speed. Therefore, our results, as well as the hypothesis of Frouin et al.
(1996), indicate that reﬂectance of foam has to be considered together with the reﬂectance due
to bubble clouds. On the other hand, there are cases in which strong wind is not correlated with
clouds. For example, the cross equatorial ﬂow during the summer monsoon in the southern
Indian Ocean is strong but the ITCZ position is in the northern hemisphere.

It is interesting to note that stabilized, coated microbubbles are hypothesized to be corre-
lated to phytoplankton and CDOM concentrations; we need parameterization of this process.
The optical properties of the ﬁrst several meters below the surface are difﬁcult to measure
and are often removed from data due to experimental problems such as ship shadow or wave
activity. This is the region where more detailed studies are needed.

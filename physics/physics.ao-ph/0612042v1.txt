Abstract

A baroclinic model for the atmospheric jet at middle-latitudes is used

as a stochastic generator of non-stationary time series of the total energy of

the system. A linear time trend is imposed on the parameter TE, descriptive

of the forced equator-to-pole temperature gradient and responsible for set-

ting the average baroclinicity in the model. The focus lies on establishing

a theoretically sound framework for the detection and assessment of trend

at extreme values of the generated time series. This problem is dealt with

by ﬁtting time-dependent Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) models to se-

quences of yearly maxima of the total energy. A family of GEV models is

used in which the location µ and scale parameters σ depend quadratically

and linearly on time, respectively, while the shape parameter ξ is kept con-

stant. From this family, a model is selected by using diagnostic graphical

tools, such as probability and quantile plots, and by means of the likelihood

ratio test. The inferred location and scale parameters are found to depend in

a rather smooth way on time and, therefore, on TE. In particular, power-law

dependences of µ and σ on TE are obtained, in analogy with the results of

a previous work where the same baroclinic model was run with ﬁxed values

of TE spanning the same range as in this case. It is emphasized under which

conditions the adopted approach is valid.

1. Introduction

In the context of Climate Change, an intensely debated question is whether the statistics of

extreme meteo-climatic events is changing (and/or will change) and, in case, how fast it is

changing (and/or will change). For example, the role of time-dependence in the statistics

of extreme weather events has been at the heart of discussions about climate change since

the work by Katz and Brown (1992). In particular, the detection of trends in the frequency

of intense precipitation has been the object of much research, particularly at regional

level, see e.g. Karl et al. (1996); Karl and Knight (1998) for the USA and Brunetti et al.

(2002, 2004) for the Mediterranean area. The general relevance of the problem has been

highlighted in the 2002 release of a speciﬁc IPCC report on Changes in extreme weather

and climate events (available at http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/support.htm). In fact, the empha-

sis laid on the subject by the IPCC report reverberated in many countries the question “is

the probability of major impact weather increasing?”. This question reached the big pub-

lic almost everywhere and innumerable studies of trends in series of “extremes” were un-

dertaken. These studies mainly deal with variables of local character, typically precipita-

tion and temperature at speciﬁc stations. Moreover, most studies are regional: see e.g. the

proceedings of the Italia-USA meeting held in Bologna in 2004 (Diaz and Nanni 2006)

for the relevance of the extreme events in the Mediterranean Climates and the INTERREG

IIIB - CADSES project HYDROCARE, http://www.hydrocare-cadses.net,

for impacts of extreme events in the hydrological cycle of the central-eastern Europe.

3

In a preceding, companion paper (Felici et al. 2006) (which we refer to by Part I in the

sequel) we have addressed the problem of extreme value statistical inference on statisti-

cally stationary time series produced by a dynamical system providing a minimal model

for the dynamics of the mid-latitudes baroclinic jet. There reported is, from mathematical

literature, a suitable, rigorous, “universal” setting for the analysis of the extreme events

in stationary time series. This is based on Gnedenko’s theorem (Gnedenko 1943) accord-

ing to which the distribution of the block-maxima of a sample of independent identically

distributed variables converges, under fairly mild assumptions, to a member of a three-

real parameter family of distributions, the so-called Generalized Extreme Value (GEV)

distribution (Coles 2001). The GEV approach to the analysis of extremse requires that

three basic conditions are met, namely the independence of the selected extreme values,

the consideration of a sufﬁciently large number of extremes, the selection of values that

are genuinely extreme. This could be performed relatively easily for the case at hand.

Part I was originally motivated by the interest in weather having “major impact” (on

human life and property) in the Mediterranean area, in particular intense precipitation and

heat waves over Italy. See, for example, Brunetti et al. (2002, 2004); Lucarini et al. (2004,

2006b); Speranza et al. (2006); Speranza and Tartaglione (2006); Tartaglione et al. (2006)

and the MEDEX Phase 1 report (available at http://medex.inm.uib.es/) for re-

lated results and activities. The study reported in Part I has revealed, among other things,

that diagnostics of extreme statistics can highlight interesting dynamical properties of

the analyzed system. Properties which, thanks to the “universality of the GEV”, can be

4

investigated in a low dimensionality space of parametric probability density functions,

although at the expenses of the total length of the observational record of the system in

order to capture a sufﬁcient number of independent extremes. A key role (that is presently

being explored elsewhere, in the context of general atmospheric circulation theory) was

played in Part I by the smoothness of variation of the extreme statistics parameters (aver-

age, variance, shape factor) upon the external (forcing) parameters of the system. In this

paper, again, we devote attention to exploring the statistics of extremes as a dynamical

indicator, this time in the framework of the (typically meteorological) statistical inference

problem of detecting trends in observations.

The deﬁnition of a rigorous approach to the study of extremes is much harder when

the property of stationarity does not hold. One basic reason is that there exists no univer-

sal theory of extreme values (such as e.g. a generalization of Gnedenko’s theorem) for

non-stationary stochastic processes. Moreover, in the analysis of observed or syntheti-

cally generated sequences of data of ﬁnite length, practical issues, such as the possibility

of unambiguously choosing the time scales which deﬁnes the statistical properties and

their changes, become of critical importance. Nevertheless, GEV-based statistical mod-

eling offers a practical uniﬁed framework also for the study of extremes in non-stationary

time series. In the applications, the three parameters of the GEV distribution are taken

as time-dependent and time is introduced as a covariate in the statistical inference pro-

cedure (Coles 2001). The practical meaning of this assumption is that the probability of

occurrence (chance) of the considered extreme events evolves in time pretty much as we

5

are inclined to think in our everyday life. However, giving a scientiﬁc meaning to such

an assumption is possible only in an intuitive, heuristical fashion: in an “adiabatic” limit

of inﬁnitely slow trends (but rigorously not even in such a limit). We adopt this point of

view not only because it is in line with the common practice and view of extremes, but

also because interesting dynamical properties can be inferred from extremes, in analogy

with the ﬁndings in Part I.

In the present paper we perform and assess time-dependent GEV inference on non-

stationary time series E(t) of the total energy obtained by the same simpliﬁed quasi-

geostrophic model that was used in Part I. The model undergoes baroclinic forcing to-

wards a given latitudinal temperature proﬁle controlled by the forced equator-to-pole

temperature difference TE; see Lucarini et al. (2006c,d) for a thorough description. We

analyze how the parameters of the GEV change with time when a linear trend is im-

posed on the large scale macroscopic forcing TE, that is, when TE is taken as a (linear)

function of time. Since this functional relation is invertible, we derive a parametrization

relating the changes in the GEV to variations in TE (instead of time). One major goal

here is to present a methodological framework to be adopted with more complex models

and with data coming from observations, as well as an assessment of the performance

of the GEV approach for the analysis of trends in extremes in the somewhat grey area

of non-stationary time series. Methodologically, our set-up is somewhat similar to that

of Zhang et al. (2003) regarding the procedures of statistical inference. However, in this

case we face two additional problems:

6

1. as in Part I, the statistical properties of the time series E(t) cannot be selected

a priori: in the stationary case (TE constant in time) and much less in the non-

stationary case there is no explicit formula for the probability distribution of the

observable E(t);

2. moreover, in the non-stationary case we even lack a deﬁnition (and in fact a mere

candidate) of what might be the probability distribution of E(t): certainly not a

frequency limit for t → ∞ (and not by construction, as opposed to Zhang et al.

(2003) who use genuinely stochastic generators).

This also means that we have no hypothesis concerning the functional form of the trend in

the statistics of extremes of E(t), resulting from the trend imposed on the control param-

eter TE. The lack of a general GEV theorem for non-stationary sequences implies that

the choice of the time-dependent GEV as a statistical model is, in principle, arbitrary:

other models might be equally (or better) suitable. Here comes into play the “adiabatic-

ity” hypothesis mentioned above, which leads to the central statement of this paper: if

the trend is sufﬁciently slow and if the statistical behaviour of the atmospheric model has

a sufﬁciently regular response with respect to variations in the external parameters, the

GEV remains a suitable model for inference of trend in extremes.

The structure of the paper follows. In Sec. 2 we describe the general problem of the

characterization of statistical trends in deterministic models, with both its conceptual and

practical implications. Then in Sec. 3 we describe how the GEV modeling can be applied

7

to non-stationary time-series and how the quality-check of the ﬁts is performed. In section

Sec. 4 we present the time series considered in this work and the set-up of the numerical

experiments performed with the atmospheric model. The inferences for various values of

the trend in the forcing parameter TE are presented in Sec. 5 and a sensitivity analysis is

carried out in Sec. 6. Comparison with the stationary case analyzed in Part I is given in

Sec. 7. In Sec. 8, ﬁnally, we summarize the main ﬁndings of this work, highlighting the

future research developments.

2. Statistical trends: the theoretical problem

The stochastic generator used in this paper to produce the time series is a deterministic

model (an ordinary differential equation), whose dynamics, for the considered range of

values of TE, is chaotic in the sense that it takes place on a strange attractor Λ in phase

space (Eckmann and Ruelle 1985). See Lucarini et al. (2006c,d) for a study of the proper-

ties of this attractor, including sensitivity with respect to initial conditions. The statistical

behaviour of this type of time series is determined by the Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen (SRB)

probability measure µ (Eckmann and Ruelle 1985): this is a Borel probability measure

in phase space which is invariant under the ﬂow f t of the differential equation, is er-

godic, is singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure in phase space and its conditional

measures along unstable manifolds are absolutely continuous, see Young (2002) and ref-

erences therein. Moreover, the SRB measure is also a physical measure: there is a set V

8

having full Lebesgue measure in a neighbourhood U of Λ such that for every continuous

observable φ : U → R, we have, for every x ∈ V , the frequency-limit characterization

lim
t→∞

φ(f t(x))dt =

(1)

Existence and uniqueness of an SRB measure µ have been proved only for very special

classes of ﬂows f t (in particular, for ﬂows that possess an Axiom-A attractor, see Young

(2002)). However, existence and uniqueness of µ are necessary to deﬁne a stationary

stochastic process associated to an observable φ. In turn, this allows to consider a given

time series of the form φ(f t(x)) : t > 0 as a realization of the stationary process, justi-

fying statistical inference on a solid theoretical basis. In part I, we conjectured existence

an uniqueness of an SRB measure for the atmospheric model, providing the theoretical

foundation to the application of GEV models in the inference of extreme values.

In certain cases of non-autonomous ordinary differential equations (for example, if the

dependence on time is periodic), it still is possible to deﬁne, at least conceptually, what

an SRB measure is. However, in the present case, due to the form of time-dependence

adopted for the parameter TE, the atmospheric model admits no invariant measure. This

means that there is no (known) way to associate a stochastic process to the time series

of the total energy.

In other words, it is even in doubt what we mean by “statistical

properties” of the time series, since it is impossible to deﬁne a probability distribution.

This conceptual problem has a very serious practical consequence:

the “operational”

9

deﬁnition of probability as a frequency limit (as in (1)) is not valid in the non-stationary

case, since the time evolution is not a sampling of a unique probability distribution. Even

if one assumes the existence of a sequence of distinct probability distributions, one for

each observation, one realization (the time series) does not contain sufﬁcient statistical

information, since each distribution is very undersampled (with only one observation).

Despite all these problems, the results in Part I suggest a framework which is, for

the moment, formulated in a heuristic way. Suppose you evolve an initial condition x in

phase space by the ﬂow f t of the autonomous atmospheric model, that is the system in

which TE is kept ﬁxed to some value T 0

E. After an initial time span (transient), say for t

larger than some t0 > 0, the evolution f t(x) may be thougth to take place on the attractor

Λ and time-averages of the form

t

φ(f t(x))dt

may be considered as approximations of

(2)

(3)

which is the average of φ by the SRB measure µ0 existing at the value TE = T 0

E (the

“attractor average” at T 0

E). Now suppose that at some t1 > t0 the parameter TE is abruptly

changed to some value T 1

E > T 0

E: there will be some transient interval, call it [t1, t2],

φdµ0,

Z

10

during which the evolution f t(x) approaches the new attractor of the atmospheric model,

that is the attractor existing for TE ﬁxed at T 1

E. After that time span, the evolution may

be considered to take place on the new attractor.

In our case, though TE varies continuously (linearly) with time, if the trend magnitude

is low, then TE may be considered constant (with good approximation) during time spans

that are sufﬁciently long in order to have both convergence to the “new” attractor and good

sampling of the “new” SRB measure, in the sense sketched above. Though admittedly

heuristic, this scenario allows to clarify under which condition it is still reasonable to

speak of “statistical properties” of a time series generated by a non-autonomous system:

namely, the closeness to a stationary situation for time spans that are sufﬁciently long.

This is the “adiabatic” hypothesis which we mentioned in the introduction. An essential

ingredient for this to hold is that the statistical properties of the autonomous model do

not sensibly depend on the external parameter TE, in the sense that no abrupt transitions

(bifurcations) should take place as TE is varied. This was indeed checked for the system

at hand in Part I. Notice that the validity of the “adiabatic” hypothesis also has a useful

practical consequence: one can use the statistics of the stationary system as a reference

against which the results for the non-stationary case can be assessed. Having this scenario

in mind, we proceed to the description of the time-dependent GEV approach in the next

section.

3. GEV modelling for non-stationary time series

3a. Stationary case

The GEV approach for sequences of independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) random

variables is by now rather standard (Castillo 1988; Coles 2001; Embrechts et al. 1997;

Falk et al. 1994; Galambos 1978; Gumbel 1958; Jenkinson 1955; Lindgren et al. 1983;

Reiss and Thomas 2001; Tiago de Oliveira 1984). The foundation is Gnedenko’s theo-

rem (Gnedenko 1943; Fisher and Tippett 1928). Consider a time series, assumed to be a

realization of a sequence of i.i.d. random variables. The time series is divided into m con-

secutive time-frames (data blocks), each containing n subsequent observations, equally

spaced in time. Denote by z1, . . . , zm the sequence of the block maxima taken over each

time-frame. Under fairly mild assumptions, the distribution of the block-maxima con-

verges, in a suitable limit involving a rescaling, to the GEV distribution, deﬁned as

G(x; µ, σ, ξ) = exp

1 + ξ

(

(cid:20)

(4)

for all x in the set {x : 1 + ξ(x − µ)/σ > 0} and G(x) = 0 otherwise, where σ > 0 and

ξ 6= 0. If ξ = 0 the limit distribution is the Gumbel distribution

G(x; µ, σ, 0) = exp

x ∈ R.

(cid:18)

(cid:18)

(cid:19)(cid:19)

GEV inference consists in estimating the distributional parameters (µ, σ, ξ) (called lo-

cation, scale and shape parameter, respectively) from the available data. A widely used

technique consists in numerically maximizing the log-likelihood function l(µ, σ, ξ). For

ξ 6= 0, this is deﬁned as

l(µ, σ, ξ) =

(6)

while an analogous formula holds for ξ = 0 (Coles 2001).

A generalization of the GEV theorem holds for time series that are realizations of

stationary stochastic processes such that the long-range dependence is weak at extreme

levels (Leadbetter 1974, 1983).

In the applications, this property is assumed to hold

whenever the block maxima are uncorrelated for sufﬁciently large block sizes. In this

case, GEV inference and assessment is carried out by the same tools (maximum likeli-

hood, diagnostic plots, etc.) used in the i.i.d. context, see Coles (2001).

3b. Time-dependent case

If stationarity of the time series does not hold, then the limiting distribution function is no

longer bound to be the GEV or any other family (4): no theories of extreme values exist

in this context. Some exact results are known only in certain very specialized types of

13

non-stationarity (H¨usler 1986; Lindgren et al. 1983), but it is very unlikely that a general

theory can be established. However, GEV-based statistical modeling of extreme values

can be performed also in the case of time-dependent phenomena by adopting a prag-

matic approach, where the GEV distribution (4) is used as a template: time-dependent

parameters µ(t) and σ(t) are considered, yielding a GEV model of the form

G(x; µ(t), σ(t), ξ).

(7)

Usually ξ is kept time-independent in order to avoid numerical problems, since it is

usually the most delicate parameter to estimate (Coles 2001). Different kinds of time-

dependence can be imposed for (µ(t), σ(t)). In this paper, we adopt a simple polynomial

family of models:

µ(t) = µ0 + µ1t + µ2t2,

σ(t) = σ0 + σ1t,

(8)

with µ0,1,2 and σ0,1 ∈ R. GEV models in family (8) are denoted by Gp,q, with 0 ≤

p ≤ 2 and 0 ≤ q ≤ 1, where p and q denote the maximum degree of t in µ(t) and

in σ(t), respectively. The time-dependent GEV model (7) constructed in this way is

a generalization of (4) (the latter is obtained by setting µ1 = µ2 = σ1 = 0 in (8)).

For model (7) with parameters (8), GEV inference amounts to estimating the parameter

14

vector

β = [µ0, µ1, µ2, σ0, σ1, ξ]

(9)

by including time t as a covariate.

Suppose we have a non-stationary dataset, from which a sequence of block maxima

zt, with t = 1, . . . , m, is constructed. A log-likelihood function for the case ξ 6= 0 is

deﬁned as

m

t=1 (cid:26)

l(β) = −

(compare with (6)), provided that

1 + ξ

σ(t)

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

> 0,

i = 1, . . . , m.

(11)

If ξ = 0, an alternative log-likelihood function, derived from the Gumbel distribution,

must be used (Coles 2001). Numerical procedures are used to maximize the selected log-

likelihood function, yielding the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter vector

β. Conﬁdence intervals for β may be computed by the expected or observed information

matrix (Coles 2001).

Of course, all of the above procedure is performed in the spirit of “pure” inference,

15

that is determining the likelihood of the adopted parametric hypothesis and not its truth

which, in the absence of a supporting theorem, remains unknown. Moreover, it should be

kept in mind that several different models might ﬁt the observations with similar reliabil-

ity (likelihood). In this case, as no universal model is suggested or enforced (as opposed

to the stationary case), there is no reason to prefer the one above the other.

3c. Assessment of statistical models

In the non-stationary context the analysis starts from a list of models (Gp,q in our case,

see (8)) which we ﬁt to the data searching for the most adequate one. Assessment and

comparisons of the inferences are based on standard graphical tools such as probabil-

ity plot, quantile plot, and the likelihood ratio test. However, for the graphical model-

checking the non-stationarity must be taken into account. Reduction to Gumbel scale is

a practical way to treat this problem (Coles 2001).

Let zt, t = 1, . . . , m be a sequence of block maxima extracted from a non-stationary

time series, from which the time-dependent GEV model G(

µ(t),

σ(t),

ξ ) has been ﬁtted

as described in the previous section. The sequence of maxima is transformed according

If Zt are random variables with distribution G(

Zt that have the standard Gumbel distribution:

e

P (

x ∈ R,

(13)

which is the GEV with parameters (µ, σ, ξ) = (0, 1, 0). Therefore, transformation (12)

attempts to remove the time-dependence from the sequence of maxima, bringing it as

close as possible to the common scale given by the standard Gumbel distribution (13).

This way, the distribution function and the quantiles of the transformed sequence of max-

ima

zt can be compared with the empirical ones derived from (13). The probability plot

is a graph of the pairs

The likelihood ratio test is used to compare the goodness-of-ﬁt of two nested models,

that is, two models such that one of them is a sub-model (a particular case) of the other

(cid:19)

e

17

one. Our family Gp,q of models is nested: for example G1,0 is a sub-model of G2,1,

obtained by setting µ2 and σ1 to zero in the parameter vector β deﬁned in (9). Given

integers 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ 2 and 0 ≤ q1 ≤ q2 ≤ 1, let l1 and l2 be the maximized values of

the log-likelihood (10) for the nested models Gp1,q1 and Gp2,q2, respectively, and deﬁne

the deviance statistic as

D = 2{l2 − l1}.

(16)

The likelihood ratio test states that the simpler model Gp1,q1 is to be rejected at the α-

level of conﬁdence in favor of Gp2,q2 if D > cα, where cα is the (1 − α)-quantile of the

χ2

k distribution and k is the number of parameters that belong to Gp2,q2 and that are null

in Gp1,q1 (k = 2 in our example above).

Although the number of time-dependent models one may choose from is virtually inﬁ-

nite, parsimony in the construction is reccommended (Coles 2001): too many coefﬁcients

in the functions (µ(t), σ(t)) would result in unacceptably large uncertainties, especially if

few data are available. The search of the best model is carried out by trial-and-error: the

choice of a more complex model should be strongly justiﬁed on theoretical grounds or by

a signiﬁcantly higher accuracy (that is, D exceedingly larger than cα for nested models).

However, the convergence of the above described procedure is by no means a guaran-

tee of good estimate of the “true” probability density function: the latter is conceptually

undeﬁned. See our remarks at the end of Sec. 3b.

4. The time series: Total Energy of the Atmospheric Jet

Model with a trend in average baroclinicity

We consider here the same baroclinic jet model used in Part I, where the spectral or-

der JT is set to 32. The model temperature is relaxed towards a given equator-to-pole

proﬁle which acts as baroclinic forcing. The statistical properties of the model radi-

cally change when the parameter TE, determining the forced equator-to-pole tempera-

ture gradient, is varied. A physical and dynamical description of the model is given

in Speranza and Malguzzi (1988); Malguzzi et al. (1990); Lucarini et al. (2006c,d).

In Part I we performed an extreme value analysis of the system’s response with respect

to variations in TE. Several stationary time series of the total energy E(t) were used as

a basis for GEV inference. Each time series was generated with TE ﬁxed at one value

within a uniform grid on the interval [10, 50], with spacing of 2 units. We recall that, given

the non-dimensionalization of the system, TE = 1 corresponds to 3.5 K, 1 unit of total

energy corresponds to roughly 5 × 1017J, and t = 0.864 is one day, see Lucarini et al.

(2006c,d). In that case, all parameters of the system being kept ﬁxed, after discarding an

initial transient each time series of the total energy could be considered as a realization

of a stationary stochastic process having weak long-range dependence. Therefore, the

classical framework for GEV modeling was applied (see Sec. 3a).

In the present setting, a speciﬁc linear trend is imposed on TE: starting at time t = 0,

19

the model is run with a the time-dependent forcing parameter

TE(t) = (T 0

E − 1) + t ∆TE,

t ∈ [0, t0],

(17)

with T 0

E = 10. Three values are chosen for the trend intensity ∆TE: 2 units every LB =

1000, 300, and 100 years, yielding three time series for the total energy E(t). The range

swept by TE(t) during integration is kept ﬁxed in all three cases to the interval [9, 51],

so that the total length of the time series depends on ∆TE. Each time series is split into

21 data blocks Bi, i = 1, . . . , 21. The length LB of each block corresponds to a time

interval I i such that, as t varies within I i, the baroclinicity parameter TE(t) by (17) spans

the interval

[T i

E − 1, T i

E + 1],

(18)

which is 2 units wide and centered around one of the values T i

E considered in Part I:

(T 0

E, T 1

E, . . . , T 21

E ) = (10, 12, 14, . . . , 50).

(19)

Therefore, the total length L of the time series depends on the trend intensity, so that we

have L = 21 × 2/∆TE = 21LB. Moreover, since the time-span over which the maxima

are computed is kept ﬁxed to one year, the number of maxima in each data block Bi also

depends on ∆TE: in fact, it is equal to LB, see Tab. 1.

Such a selection of the intervals as in (18) allows for a direct comparison of the present

20

results with those obtained for stationary time series in Part I. Moreover, our choices

regarding block length and other factors are based on the indications provided in Part I,

where the goodness-of-ﬁt assessments performed by a variety of means showed that:

• the adopted block length of one year makes sure that the extremes are uncorrelated

and genuinely extreme;

inferences.

• the minumum length (100 data) used for the sequences of maxima yields robust

5. Time-dependent GEV Analysis of the Total Energy

For each data block Bi, i = 1, . . . , 21, we ﬁrst extract a sequence of yearly maxima

zi
t, with t = 1, . . . , LB. For compactness, each sequence is denoted in vector form as

zi = (zi

1, zi

2, . . . , zi

LB ). One GEV model of the form Gp,q (see (8)) is ﬁtted from each of

the sequences zi. For each i = 1, . . . , 21, the analysis follows three main steps:

1. nested models Gp,q, for 0 ≤ p ≤ 2 and 0 ≤ q ≤ 1, are ﬁtted on the i-th sequence

of maxima zi;

2. models with too low maximum likelihood are discarded and the deviance test is

applied to the others to select the best estimate model;

3. the best estimate model is graphically checked by examining the probability and

quantile plots, and it is possibly rejected in favor of a model having less nonzero

21

parameters in the vector β as in (9).

Following the above procedure, for each time interval I i, i = 1, . . . , 21 time-dependent

GEV models Gbpi,bqi(zi) with parameters (

µi(t),

σi(t),

ξi) are inferred from the data block

zi. Model Gbpi,bqi(zi) (denoted for shortness Gbpi,bqi in the rest of this section) is the best

b

b

b

estimate for the i-th data block, relative to the family of models Gp,q. Choosing a model

with different orders (p, q) would either give poor results in the graphical checks, or fail

to pass the likelihood ratio test. An example is given in Fig. 1, for the data block i = 8

in the time series with ∆TE = 2/(1000 years). The best estimate model has orders

(

pi,

qi) = (1, 0). Models G0,0 and G2,1 are rejected, since they have too small likelihood

and since the ﬁt quality is very low, as it is illustrated by the probability and quantile

b

plots. On the basis of the diagnostic plots, models G1,0 and G1,1 are both acceptable.

However, the deviance statistic satisﬁes D = 2{l1,1 − l1,0} = 3.64 < c0.5 = 3.84 which

is the 0.95-quantile of the χ2

1-distribution. Therefore, as there is no strong support for

selecting model G1,1, according to the likelihood ratio test the more parsimonious model

G1,0 is preferred.

Plots of the best estimate parameters (

µi(t),

σi(t),

ξi) as functions of time are pro-

posed in Fig. 2. Conﬁdence intervals are computed as the worst case estimates: sup-

be the uncertainties in µi

For most of the time intervals I i, the best estimate model is such that

inferred with the fastest trend intensity ∆TE = 2/(100 years) (see Tab. 4), whereas for

∆TE = 2/(300 years) there are two exceptions: intervals i = 3 and i = 8, for which also

σi(t) grows linearly in time (

qi = 1, see Tab. 3). For the slowest trend intensity we obtain

qi = 1 for i = 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and zero otherwise, whereas
b

b

pi = 2 for i = 1, 2, 7 and

pi = 1

otherwise, see Tab. 4. Summarizing, the best ﬁts are mostly achieved by lowest order non-

stationary models of the form (

pi,

qi) = (1, 0). For slower trends, however, in some cases

the best ﬁt is of the form (

pi,

qi) = (1, 1) or even (

pi,

qi) = (2, 1). These cases typically

b

occur for low i, that is, in the ﬁrst portion of the time series. This is due to the fact that,

b

for small TE (corresponding to small t through equation (17)), although the hypothesis of

smoothness, described in Sec. 2, may still be considered valid, the rate of variation of the

SRB measure with respect to variations in TE is comparatively larger. To put it in simple

words, the statistical behaviour (the attractor) of the baroclinic model is rather sensitive

with respect to changes in TE. Therefore, the variation of the statistical properties in time

is not quite “adiabatic”, in the sense speciﬁed in Sec. 2. Correspondingly, a statistical

model of enhanced complexity (more parameters) is needed to achieve goodness-of-ﬁt.

23

In concluding this section, we emphasize that the convergence of the numerical pro-

cedure used in the maximization of the likelihood function is here considerably more

problematic than in the stationary case studied in Part I. Indeed, in the present case it is

often necessary to choose a good starting point for the maximization procedure in order

to achieve convergence. For example, in several cases, after achieving convergence for a

GEV model with order, say (p, q) = (2, 1), by using the inferred values of the parame-

ter vector β in (9) as starting values for the maximization, a better ﬁt (larger likelihood)

of lower order is obtained. In fact, this has allowed us to reduce the total number of

inferences with p = 2 and/or q = 1.

6. Trend assessment

When dealing with non-stationary data, the problem of assessing the sensitivity of trend

inferences is particularly delicate. Beyond the serious conceptual problems explained in

Sec. 2, one is confronted with several practical issues. Most of the sensitivity tests in

Part I were based on examining a shorter portion of same time series or on calculating

the maxima on data blocks of different lengths. In the present non-stationary context,

both operations would result in an alteration of the statistical properties of the sample

(exactly because of the non-stationarity) and this makes comparisons somewhat ambigu-

ous. An example is provided in Fig. 3, where we compute the best estimate GEV ﬁts

using sequences of yearly maxima having different lengths – but starting at the same

24

instant (year 14500) – extracted from the time series with the slowest trend intensity

∆TE = 2/(1000 years). Notice that the best ﬁt obtained by taking 100 yearly maxima

is stationary. The corresponding extrapolations in time are, of course, completely wrong.

By using 500 and 1000 maxima, the best estimates obtained (not shown) fall inside the

conﬁdence band of the 2000 years-based estimate for most values of time.

The above example illustrates the trend dilemma: on the one hand, in order to be

detected, a statistical trend has to be sufﬁciently fast with respect to the length of the

record of observations; on the other hand, if the trend is too fast then the “adiabatic

hypothesis” discussed in Sec. 2 is no longer valid: one is left with no “reference statistics”

against which the inferred models can be compared.

Moreover, when considering large time spans a further practical complication arises:

due to the nonlinear dependence of the statistical properties with respect to the external

parameter TE, a functional relation between the GEV parameters and time might require

many parameters to achieve goodness-of-ﬁt. Therefore, one faces the problem of large

uncertainties in the parameter estimates or even lack of convergence. This has indeed

been observed for the present time series: if we consider a long record, such that the

change in TE is large, the model family Gp,q with parameters as in (8) becomes inade-

quate to catch the time dependence of the statistics of extremes. A ﬁrst indication of this

was reported at the end of Sec. 5. As a further example, we have examined a data block

of length 5000 starting at year 14500 in the time series with ∆TE = 2/(1000 years). In-

spection of graphical diagnostics (probability and quantile plots) reveals that no model in

25

the family Gp,q produces an acceptable inference. It should be emphasized that goodness-

of-ﬁt is achieved for the same time series using blocks of length 1000, that is, performing

inferences that are more localized in time. So in this case the problem is not the failure of

the “adiabatic” or smoothness hypothesis, but the nonlinear dependence of the attractor

on the parameter TE, which manifests itself on sufﬁciently large time intervals.

7. Smooth dependence on the forcing

The set-up of the present analysis (see Sec. 4) has been chosen to allow comparison of the

non-stationary GEV inferences with the results of Part I, obtained from statistically sta-

tionary time series. To perform the comparison, for each i = 1, . . . , 21 the best estimate

parameters (

µi(t),

σi(t),

ξi) inferred from data block Bi are ﬁrst expressed as functions of

TE inside the interval (18). This is achieved by inverting the trend formula (17), (writing

b

b

b

time as a function of TE):

t(TE) =

TE − T 0
∆TE

E + 1

,

TE ∈ [9, 51].

(21)

and inserting this into the expression of (

µi(t),

σi(t),

ξi). This yields functions that are

denoted as (

µi(TE),

σi(TE),

ξi). These are evaluated at the central point T i

b

E of the interval

b

b

of deﬁnition and plotted in Fig. 4. Conﬁdence intervals are given by the same worst

b

b

b

case estimate (20) used for Fig. 2. A rather smooth dependence on TE is observed,

especially for the GEV parameters µ and σ. The location parameter µ turns out to be

26

not very sensitive to changes in the trend intensity, being much more sensibly dependent

on variations in TE. Moreover its conﬁdence intervals are always very small (relatively

to the size of µ).

Denote by G0,0(wi) the time-independent GEV models inferred in Part I from sta-

tionary sequences wi of 1000 yearly maxima, computed with TE ﬁxed at T i

E. Denote as

˜µi, ˜σi, and ˜ξi the inferred values of the GEV parameters of G0,0(wi). Since the graphs

of the parameters ˜µi, ˜σi, and ˜ξi versus T i

E very closely match those in Fig. 4, comparison

with the stationary data is presented under the form of relative differences (Fig. 5). To be

precise, on the left column the absolute values of the ratios

E) − ˜µi
E) + ˜µi

µi(T i
µi(T i
b
b

(22)

are plotted against T i

E (similarly for the GEV parameters σ and ξ). Remarkable agreement

is obtained for the parameter µ: the relative differences less than 10% and drop below 5%

for large TE and for all considered trend intensities. Excellent agreement is also obtained

for σ (particularly for large TE) and for ξ except for the fastest trend intensity ∆TE =

2/(100 years). In the latter case, indeed, the sample uncertainty is as large as (or even

larger than) the estimates self.

We emphasize that inferring time-independent models G0,0(zi) from the non-stationary

data zi would induce very large errors (particularly in the scale and shape parameters),

compare Fig. 1. A much better (even surprising) agreement between the stationary and

27

non-stationary estimates is obtained with the procedure described in the previous section:

ﬁrst ﬁtting the time-dependent model Gbpi,bqi(zi) and then evaluating its parameters at the

central point T i

E. There is agreement even in the estimates of the parameter ξ, which is

usually the most difﬁcult one to infer. Indeed, the inferred values are negative. in the case

of stationary time series, since the attractor is bounded and since the energy observable

E(t) is a continuous function of the phase space variables, the total energy is bounded on

any orbit lying on (or converging to) the attractor. Therefore, the total energy extremes

are necessarily Weibull distributed (ξ is negative) Part I. Although this property is not

bound to hold for non-stationary forcing, it is still veriﬁed, see Tab. 2.

Two distinct power law regimes are identiﬁed for the GEV parameters (

µi,

σi,

ξi) as

functions of T i

E, having the form

and

(23)

b

ee Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. The values of the ﬁtted exponents γµ and γσ in each scaling regime

are reported in Tab. 5 and Tab. 6, respectively. A similar power law dependence of the

GEV parameters on TE was already observed in Part I for the stationary data sets wi:

indeed, the exponents obtained there are very similar to those in Tab. 5 and Tab. 6, par-

ticularly for large TE. The lack of a power-law scaling regime for the parameter σ for

small TE explains both the more pronounced differences between the stationary and non-

stationary estimates (Fig. 5) and the necessity of including a quadratic term in µ and/or a

28

linear term for σ in the statistical model to get acceptable inferences. This highlights the

strongly nonlinear behaviour of the baroclinic model, whose response to changes of TE

has different features depending on the considered range of variation.

Two factors explain the qualitative analogies and the quantitative agreements between

the time-dependent models discussed here and the stationary results of Part I. First of all,

the trend intensity imposed on TE in all cases is sufﬁciently slow with respect to the time

of relaxation of the baroclinic model to the statistics of extreme values of the total en-

ergy. For clarity, we emphasize that the latter time scale is that used in Sec. 2 to deﬁne

the “adiabatic” hypothesis: it is the time necessary to obtain a good sampling of the SRB

measure on the attractor, provided that one may consider the system as “frozen” (with

constant TE) for sufﬁciently long time spans. We do not know whether this time scale

bears any physical relation with other time scales, such as those of baroclinic instability

or low-frequency variability (both have been described in Speranza and Malguzzi (1988)

for the present model). The second factor is that the system’s statistical behaviour re-

sponds rather smoothly to the imposed time-dependent variation of the parameter TE.

This smooth dependence on TE of the statistical properties of the baroclinic model was

analyzed in detail in Lucarini et al. (2006c,d) by considering not only global physical

quantities such as total energy and average wind proﬁles, but also ﬁner dynamical indi-

cators, such as the Lyapunov exponents and dimension. Both properties of smoothness

and “adiabaticity” are of crucial importance in order to justify the usage of non-stationary

GEV models that are (locally) smooth functions of time, such as our polinomial family

29

Gp,q.

8. Summary and Conclusions

In this paper we have proposed a general, although not universal, framework for the anal-

ysis of trends in extremes of climatic time series. When all the shortcomings which are

present in datasets and observations have to be considered, a rigorous deﬁnition of ex-

tremes and a neat, clean, and legible approach to the evaluation of trends is necessary

in order to get useful and reliable information (Zhang et al. 2005). The time-dependent

approach allows to express the inferred GEV distributional parameters as functions of

time. As expected, it is found that trend in the statistics of extreme values is detectable

in a reliable way, provided that the record of observations is sufﬁciently long, depend-

ing on the time scale of the trend itself. Trend inference and assessment is much more

problematic than in the statistically stationary inference. First of all, one is faced with

a serious conceptual problem: there is no “operational” deﬁnition of probability, since,

to say it in loose words, the time series is not a sampling of a unique probability dis-

tribution, as it is in the stationary case. Even if one assumes that the time series is a

realization of a sequence of random variables (with different distributions), the statistical

properties of the sample are altered by any operation such as resampling or taking shorter

subsamples, which makes sensitivity studies somewhat ambiguous. One must assume

that the distributions of the random variables vary slowly and smoothly with time, so that

30

the time series contains sufﬁcient sampling information on the “local” (in time) statistical

behaviour.

In the present context, we have adopted GEV models whose parameters are poly-

nomial in time: the location parameter µ is at most quadratic with respect to time and

the scale parameter σ is at most linear in time. Since the relation between the macro-

scopic forcing TE and time is invertible, the time dependence of the inferred GEV mod-

els can be expressed as a relation between the GEV parameters and TE, showing rather

interesting properties. The location and scale parameters feature power-law dependence

with respect to TE, while the shape parameter has in all cases a negative value. As ex-

pected, both results are in agreement with what obtained in the companion paper (Part I)

for stationary data. Since the parameter TE increases monotonically in the simulations

with the baroclinic model, the system certainly does not possess any invariant measure.

However, the results suggest that, as TE increases, the system explores statistical states

which vary smoothly with TE and whose properties are locally quite similar to those ob-

tained in the stationary setting. This is even captured for the relatively fast trend intensity

∆TE = 2/(100 years). The proposed explanation is that:

1. the system’s statistical properties depend rather smoothly on TE (also compare (Lucarini et al.

2006c,d));

2. the adopted time-scales of variation of TE (i.e., the trend intensity ∆TE) are sufﬁ-

ciently slow compared to the relaxation time to the statistics of extreme values.

31

The second condition, that was explained in more detail in Sec. 2, amounts to the heuris-

tic statement that for sufﬁciently short time spans the system’s statistical properties can

be considered frozen to those holding for a corresponding value of TE. The possibility

of using GEV models that are locally smooth (polynomial functions of time) depends

essentially on these two conditions. For example, for a system having several bifurca-

tions as the control parameter is changed the time-dependent GEV modeling would be

much more complicated. This problem is currently under investigation. However, even if

the above two conditions do hold, the inference of time-dependent GEV models is valid

locally in time, that is, if the sequences of maxima used for the inference span not too

large time periods. For large time spans, indeed, the non-linear response of the baroclinic

model to variations in TE becomes dominant and polynomial GEV models are no longer

suitable. On the other hand, if the sequences of maxima used for the inference are too

short (depending on the trend intensity), wrong trend estimates may be obtained.

We conclude by observing that the present and the companion paper (Part I) are de-

voted not merely to the statistical inference of extremes and their trends but also to explore

the possibility of using extreme statistics in diagnosing the dynamical state of a geophys-

ical ﬂuid. Our analysis of the problem reveals, in fact, that diagnostics which is based

on “universal” (GEV theorem), robust (smoothness properties), simple (power-law scal-

ing), controllable (low-dimensional parametric) statistical models can help very much in

setting up well targeted models of the general circulation, see (Lucarini et al. 2006c,d).

There are several ways in which we plan to extend the present study. First of all, we

32

have considered a rather global indicator, the total energy of the system. Other choices

might be to analyze the wave kinetic energy, the available energy or also the maximum

vorticity on the domain of the model, which might behave differently as TE is changed.

Moreover, there are delicate issues connected with reducing the scale from a global indi-

cator to a local one, such as the value of the wind on a grid point. This brings into play

all complications due to the multifractality and the spatial dependence of the process. A

further development of the present work is the usage of extreme statistics as a dynamical

indicator, in the sense of process oriented metrics Lucarini et al. (2006a). All these issues

are currently under investigation.

Diagnostic plots of GEV inferences with model (7) and parameters as

in (8), for block Bi with i = 8 (corresponding to T i

E = 24) and ∆TE =

2/(1000 years). Top row: probability plots. Bottom row: quantile plots.

From left to right column: plots for models Gp,q (see (8)), with (p, q) and

the corresponding log-likelihood l (see (6)) indicated on top.

GEV parameters as functions of time, for the three considered values

of trend intensity ∆TE: from top to bottom, ∆TE = 2/(1000 years),

2/(300 years), and 2/(100 years), respectively. For each trend intensity

the inferred time-dependent parameters (µ(t), σ(t), ξ) (left, center, right

column, respectively) of the best estimate model Gbpi,bqi(zi) are plotted.

Parameter µ(t) of the best estimate GEV inferences as a function of time.

The time series with slowest trend intensity ∆TE = 2/(1000 years) has

been used, taking yearly maxima over a data block starting at year 14001.

For legibility, only the conﬁdence intervals have been plotted. Left: in-

ferences obtained with 100, 500, and 1000 yearly maxima. The best

estimate ﬁt based on 100 data is stationary (µ1 = 0) and it has been

extrapolated to 500 years. Right: inferences obtained with 500, 1000,

and 2000 yearly maxima. In all cases, the best estimate GEV model has

p = 1, that is, µ(t) = µ0 + µ1t is a linear function of time.

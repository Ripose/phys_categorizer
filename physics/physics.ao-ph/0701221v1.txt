Abstract

The problem of scattering of linear internal waves from small com-
pact sea bottom inhomogeneities is considered from the point of view
of mode-to-mode scattering. A simple formula for modal conversion
coeﬃcients Cnm , quantifying the amount of energy that is scattered
into the n-th mode from the incident ﬁeld m-th mode, is derived. In
this formula the representation of inhomogeneities by their expansions
into the Fourier and Fourier-Bessel series with respect to angular and
radial coordinates respectively are used. Results of calculations, per-
formed in a simple model case, are presented. The obtained formula
can be used for a formulation of the inverse problem, as it was done
in the acoustic case [2, 3].

Keywords: internal wave, scattering

1 Introduction

The concept of mode-to-mode scattering was considered in the context of
the acoustic scattering from small compact irregularities of the ocean ﬂoor by
Wetton, Fawcett [1]. In their work some simple formulas for modal conversion
coeﬃcients, quantifying the amount of energy that is scattered from one
normal mode of the sound ﬁeld to another, were derived. Recently new
formulas for these coeﬃcients were obtained by Zakharenko [2] and applied
to the inverse scattering problem in the subsequent work [3]. This paper
contains the detailed derivation of such formulas in the case of scattering of
linear internal waves from small compact sea bottom inhomogeneities. Some
numerical examples are presented.

We shall use the linearized equations for inviscid, incompressible stably strat-
iﬁed ﬂuid, written for the harmonic dependence on the time with the factor
e−iωt in the form

iωρ0u + βPx = 0,
iωρ0v + βPy = 0,
iωρ0w + βPz + βρ1 = 0,
iωρ1 + wρ0z = 0,

where x, y, and z are the Cartesian co-ordinates with the z-axis directed
upward, ρ0 = ρ0(z) is he undisturbed density, ρ1 = ρ1(x, y, z) is the pertur-
bation of density due to motion, P is the pressure, and u, v w are the x,
y and z components of velocity respectively. The variables are nondimen-
sional, based on a length scale ¯h(a typical vertical dimension), a time scale
¯N −1 (where ¯N is a typical value of the Brunt-V¨ais¨ala frequency), and a den-
sity scale ¯ρ (a typical value of the density). The parameter β is g/(¯h ¯N 2),
where g is the gravity acceleration.

The boundary conditions for these equations are

H,

where H = H(x, y) is the bottom topography.

We introduce a small parameter ǫ, and postulate that the components of

velocity and the pressure are represented in the form

u = u0 + ǫu1 + . . . ,

v = v0 + ǫv1 + . . . ,

w = w0 + ǫw1 + . . . ,

P = P0 + ǫP1 + . . .

We suppose also that the bottom topography is represented in the form
H = h0 + ǫh1, where h0 is constant and h1 = h1(x, y) is a function of x,
y vanishing outside the bounded domain Ω, which in the sequel is called a
domain of inhomogeneity.

Excluding from the system (1) ρ1 and substituting the introduced expan-

sions, we obtain

iωρ0(u0 + ǫu1 + . . .) + β(P0x + ǫP1x + . . .) = 0,
iωρ0(v0 + ǫv1 + . . .) + β(P0y + ǫP1y + . . .) = 0,
(ω2ρ0 + βρ0z)(w0 + ǫw1 + . . .) + iωβ(P0z + ǫPz1 + . . .) = 0,
(u0x + ǫu1x + . . .) + (v0y + ǫv1y + . . .) + w0z + ǫw1z + . . . = 0,

Separating terms in various orders of ǫ, we obtain a sequence of boundary

Diﬀerentiating the third equation in (5) twice with respect to x and twice
with respect to y, summing obtained equations and replacing β(P0zxx+P0zyy)
by

iω(ρ0w0z)z, we obtain

−

(ω2ρ0 + βρ0z)(w0xx + w0yy) + ω2(ρ0w0z)z = 0.

(6)

We seek a solution to this equation in the form of the sum of normal modes
w0 = ei(kx+ly)φ(z), where φ is the eigenfunction of the spectral boundary
problem

countably many eigenvalues λn, which are all positive. The corresponding
real eigenfunctions φn we normalize by the condition

In our scattering problem w0 is the incident ﬁeld, and we shall calculate the
main term of scattering ﬁeld w1, so we act in the framework of the Born
approximation.

At the ﬁrst order of ǫ we obtain the following system of equations:

−
−

iωρ0u1 + βP1x = 0,
iωρ0v1 + βP1y = 0,
(ω2ρ0 + βρ0z)w1 + iωβP1z = 0,
u1x + v1y + w1z = 0,

So far as we are interesting in the connection of modal contents of incident
and scattering ﬁelds, we suppose that the incident ﬁeld consists of one mode
w0 = ei(knx+lny)φn(z). Reducing the second boundary condition (12) to the
boundary z =
h0 with taking into account the explicit form of w0, we obtain
the new boundary condition for w1 at the boundary z =

Reducing the system (11) in the same manner as it was done for the

system (5), we obtain the equation for w1:

of orthogonality and normalization (8), (9) and the boundary condition (13),

of parameter λ was taken to be equal to 0.003 , which corresponds to the
typical stratiﬁcation in the ocean shelf zones. The domain of inhomogeneity
has the form of the ellipse with the big and small radii a and b of which were

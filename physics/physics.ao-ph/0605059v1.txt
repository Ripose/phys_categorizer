ABSTRACT

The Hilbert Huang Transform is a new technique for the analysis of non–stationary signals. It comprises two
distinct parts: Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and the Hilbert Transform of each of the modes found
from the ﬁrst step to produce a Hilbert Spectrum. The EMD is an adaptive decomposition of the data, which
results in the extraction of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). We discuss the application of the EMD to the
calibration of two optical scintillometers that have been used to measure C2
n over horizontal paths on a building
rooftop, and discuss the advantage of using the Marginal Hilbert Spectrum over the traditional Fourier Power
Spectrum.

Keywords: Empirical Mode Decomposition, Hilbert Transform, Strength of Turbulence, Scintillation

1. INTRODUCTION

The common practice when studying time series data is to invoke the tools of Fourier spectral analysis. Although
extremely versatile and simple, the technique suﬀers from some stiﬀ contraints that limit its usefulness when
attempting to examine the eﬀects of optical turbulence in the frequency domain. Namely, the system must be
linear and the data must be strictly periodic or stationary. Strict stationarity is a constraint that is impossible
to satisfy simply on practical grounds, since no detector can cover all possible points in phase space. The
linearity requirement is also not generally fulﬁlled, since turbulent processes are by deﬁnition non–linear.

Fortunately a new technique that has come to be known as the Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT) has been
developed,1 patented by NASA. This allows for the frequency space analysis of non–stationary, non–linear
signals. The HHT is composed of two main algorithms for ﬁltering and analyzing such data series. Firstly it
employs an adaptive technique to decompose the signal into a number of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) that
have well prescribed instantaneous frequencies, deﬁned as the ﬁrst derivative of the phase of an analytic signal.
The second step is to convert these IMFs into an energy–time–frequency relationship, by means of the Hilbert
Transform.

Asides from overcoming the problems associated with more traditional Fourier methods, the HHT makes it
possible to visualize the energy spread between available frequencies locally in time, rather like wavelet transform
methods. The advantage the HHT has over wavelet transforms is that it is of much higher resolution, since it
does not a priori assume a basis; rather it ”lets the data do the talking”.

2. INSTANTANEOUS FREQUENCY

Key to the HHT is the idea of instantaneous frequency, which we will sometimes refer to as simply ”the
frequency”. The ideal instantaneous frequency is quite simply the frequency of the signal at a single time
point. No knowledge is required of the signal at other times. Naturally such a statement leads to diﬃculties in
deﬁnition; Huang et al2 take it to be the derivative of the phase of the analytic signal, found from the real and
imaginary parts of the signal’s Hilbert Transform, which we follow.

The immediate problem in dealing with a phase so deﬁned is that, for the most part, the Hilbert Transforms
of the direct signals are not well behaved resulting in negative instantaneous frequencies which do not represent
physical eﬀects. The method by which this is circumvented is to ensure that the input to the Hilbert Transform
obeys the following conditions:

(a) The number of local extrema of the input and the number of its zero crossings must be either equal or

diﬀer at most by one.

(b) At any point in time t, the mean value of the upper envelope (determined by the local maxima) and the

lower envelope (determined by the local minima) is zero.

The functions that obey these are considered the IMFs.

3. EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION

We have implemented an IMF ﬁltering algorithm, known as Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), following
Huang et al.1, 3 The IMFs and the residual trend line thus obtained are veriﬁed to be complete by simply
summing them to recreate the signal. The maximum relative error we have found is of the order 10−9 %.

For convenience, we refer to the lowest order IMF as one with the fastest oscillation. The bottom–most graph is the
residual after removing all the IMFs and represents the overall trend.

The IMFs show that in a very real sense the EMD method is acting as a ﬁlter bank, separating the more
rapid oscillations from the slower oscillations. It seems that a subset of the individual IMFs may be added
to determine the eﬀect of physical variables, as suggested in Figure 2. In the absence of the major eﬀects of

we examined the energy in the IMFs and compared the energy in each mode to the energy distribution of red
noise. As an initial na¨ive estimator, we take IMF1 to be representative of the noise contained in the data. This
is unlikely to be completely correct; probably a better noise estimator would be IMF1 - <IMF1>, where the
angle brackets signify the mean value over the same temporal epoch (e.g. month or season). We do not do this
simply because we do not have suﬃcient data.

We deﬁne the red noise (random) time series to be an AR1 process

The terms are:

r(tn) = σE(tn) + ρr(tn−1)

(1)

(2)

σ := standard deviation of IMF1
E := uniform distribution of random numbers between 1 and -1
tn
r

:= the nth timestep
:= the random time series

The IMFs of an ensemble of AR1 time series are generated and then this Monte Carlo is used to simulate
the power distribution of the noise. The power of each C2
n derived IMF is then compared to the noise power
distribution to determine the mode’s signiﬁcance. Figure 4 shows that of the IMFs, the ﬁrst three lie at or
below the median red noise power. IMF4 to IMF9 lie above the median noise power, with the higher order IMFs
being most signiﬁcant. We interpret this simulation to mean that IMF6-IMF9 are highly physically signiﬁcant.

4. HILBERT TRANSFORM OF IMFS

Following the decomposition into IMFs of the original signal, the derived components can be Hilbert transformed
to produce a time–frequency map or spectrum. Figure 5 shows that during the hours when there is no solar
insolation the C2
n energy is distributed in the lowest frequencies. The highest frequencies sampled are only
reached after the Sun is contributing energy into the lower atmosphere. The discontinuous, ﬁlamentary aspect
of the plot indicates a large number of phase dropouts which shows that the data are non–stationary.

We are also able to ﬁnd a Marginal Spectrum by integrating the Hilbert spectrum across time. The Marginal
Spectrum shown in Figure 6 clearly suﬀers from less leakage into the high frequencies than the Power Spectrum.
The interpretation of both spectra are quite diﬀerent: the Fourier Power Spectrum indicates that certain
frequencies exist throughout the entire signal with a given squared amplitude. The Marginal Spectrum, on the
other hand, describes the probability that a frequency exists at some local time point in the signal. It is clear

that the two spectra have a diﬀerence in the standard deviations: the logarithm of the Marginal Spectrum has a
standard deviation of 1.88 compared to the logarithm of the Fourier Power Spectrum, whose standard deviation
is 2.24.

Applying a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test to the two spectra returns a P–value of 0 and a cumulative distribution
function distance of 1, indicating that the data sets represent diﬀerent distributions, as we might guess from
their diﬀerent gradients. We may therefore state that the spectra are unrelated and we argue on the basis of
non–stationarity that the Fourier Power Spectrum has little, if any, physical meaning.

5. INSTRUMENTS AND DATA REDUCTION

The C2
on the rooftop of the Physics Department.

n data used in this study was collected during 2006 at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayag¨uez Campus,

The data were obtained with two commercially available scintillometers (model LOA-004) from Optical

Scientiﬁc Inc, co–located such that the transmitter of system 1 was next to the receiver of system 2.

Each LOA-004 instrument comprises of a single modulated infrared transmitter whose output is detected
by two single pixel detectors. For these data, the separation between transmitter and receiver was just under
100-m. The sample rate was set to 10 seconds, so that each C2
n point was found from a 10 second time average.
The path integrated C2
n measurements are determined by the LOA instruments by computation from the log–
amplitude scintillation (Cχ(r)) of the two receiving signals.4, 5 The algorithm for relating Cχ(r) to C2
n is based
on an equation for the log–amplitude covariance function in Kolmogorov turbulence by Cliﬀord et al.6

The data was collected by dedicated PCs, one per instrument. During analysis, the data were smoothed by
a 120 point (10 minute) boxcar rolling average. This value was chosen for future ease of comparison with local
weather station data, sampled at one reading per 10 minutes. Figure 7 compares the extracted IMFs from a
single day, from midnight to midnight. There are no data dropouts in the time signal for instrument A, while
instrument B is 99.81% valid. A visual examination reveals that the measured C2
n functions are very similar
and both instruments have 11 IMFs. Diﬀerences are to be found in the IMFs themselves. In Figure 8 we show

the Hilbert Marginal Spectra derived from the IMFs together with a Kolmogorov Power Spectrum trend scaled
to start coincident with the Marginal Spectra. Both Marginal Spectra follow each other fairly well, with similar
frequency probabilities. Applying a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test to the two Marginal Spectra data sets gives the
same means and standard deviations. This is indicative of a P–value of 1 and a cumulative distribution function
distance of 0, so we may conclude that the instrument outputs have come from exactly the same distribution
and are statistically identical. A further conﬁrmation can be found by calculating the Hilbert phase diﬀerence
between the two Marginal Spectra. Such a test displays phase synchronization, or lack thereof. In this case we
ﬁnd a phase diﬀerence of zero, so that the spectra are perfectly in phase.

6. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented the results of applying the Hilbert Huang Transform to C2
n time series data. When used
to compare the outputs of two of the same model of commercial scintillometer, we have been able to demon-
strate that they provide identical output in terms of their Hilbert Marginal Spectra. It is clear that the HHT
technique is a very useful tool in the analysis of non–stationary turbulence data and promises much in terms of
understanding the nature of optical turbulence.

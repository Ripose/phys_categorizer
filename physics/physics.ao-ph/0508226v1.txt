We investigate sound ray propagation in a range-dependent underwater aousti waveguide. Our

attention is foused on sensitivity of ray dynamis to the vertial struture of a sound-speed per-

turbation indued by oean internal waves. Two models of longitudinal sound-speed variations are

onsidered: a periodi inhomogeneity and a stohasti one. It is found that vertial osillations of a

sound-speed perturbation an a(cid:27)et rays in a resonant manner. Suh resonanes give rise to haos

in ertain regions of phase spae. It is shown that stability of steep rays, being observed in exper-

iments, is onneted with suppression of resonanes in the ase of small-sale vertial sound-speed

osillations.

Internal waves in the deep oean are known to have

ontinuous spetrum and must be onsidered rather as

a stohasti proess than a deterministi one. So the

following question arises:

in what extent results of the

previous setion an be referred to aousti propagation

in a randomly perturbed sound hannel? Our goal now is

to investigate how ray dynamis depends on the vertial

sale of random longitudinal sound-speed variations.

an be aptured in resonane with vertial sound-speed

Our results rely on the ray approximation without re-

If Lz is small enough, orrelation length is ex-
pressed as L = Lz/p and, therefore, is minimal for steep

they an be worthwhile for understanding some features

This suggestion is mainly based on the results presented

in the reent paper [41℄, there the task of the ray/wave

in [41℄, improving of ray preditions requires to smooth

In (51)(cid:21)(52) we used the notation

where Ω is the areer frequeny and tan φmax
mal grazing angle. For Ω = 75 Hz this sale of roughly of
110 m. On the other hand, we have found ray dynamis

is the maxi-

to be very sensitive to the fine struture of the internal

wave field, that implies the arrival pattern to hange with

varying frequeny. For instane, the early portion of a

reeived pulse an lose stability at very low frequenies,

when the threshold given by (47) is large. This seems

to assoiate the anomalous low-frequeny sound attenu-

ation [42℄ with strong ray esaping.

However, there are many questions onerning stru-

ture of late arrivals. First, λmin

is large enough for flat

rays, so they are expeted to be insensitive to the small

vertial features of the bakground sound-speed profile.

Seond, it is impossible to use geometrial aoustis to

desribe the propagation along the axis of a waveguide

due to multiple austis [43℄. On the other hand, forming

of oherent ray lusters should explain the well-resolved

oherent late arrivals whih were observed at 28 Hz in the

AST experiment [44℄. So the following question arises:

in what extent ompliated struture of the arrival final

is linked with ray haos? This topi will be aim of our

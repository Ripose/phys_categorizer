The Antarctic climate anomaly and galactic cosmic rays

It has been proposed that galactic cosmic rays may inﬂuence the Earth’s climate by aﬀecting
cloud formation. If changes in cloudiness play a part in climate change, their eﬀect changes sign
in Antarctica. Satellite data from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) are here used
to calculate the changes in surface temperatures at all latitudes, due to small percentage changes
in cloudiness. The results match the observed contrasts in temperature changes, globally and in
Antarctica. Evidently clouds do not just respond passively to climate changes but take an active
part in the forcing, in accordance with changes in the solar magnetic ﬁeld that vary the cosmic-ray
ﬂux.

Evidence has accumulated in recent years that the
inﬂux of galactic cosmic rays, as modulated by solar
magnetic activity, inﬂuences the Earth’s temperature by
varying the cloudiness at low altitudes[1, 2, 3]. Electrons
liberated by muons help to make the cloud condensation
nuclei on which water droplets form[4]. There is now no
reason to doubt that the Earth’s atmosphere acts like a
natural cloud chamber that registers the passing muons.
What remains to be demonstrated is that the resulting
clouds aﬀect the climate, and that is the purpose of this
paper.

Contradictory trends in temperature in Antarctica and
the rest of the world, which are evident on timescales
from millennia to decades, provide a strong clue to what
drives climate change. The southern continent is distin-
guished by its isolation and by its unusual response to
changes in cloud cover. While the rest of the global sur-
face is (on balance) cooled by clouds, they have a warm-
ing eﬀect on high-albedo snowﬁelds[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
NASA’s Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE)
[11, 12] provided valuable data on the eﬀects of clouds
at diﬀerent latitudes. They can be interpreted to show
that, if changes in cloudiness drive climate change, the
anomalous behavior of Antarctica is predictable

Borehole temperatures in the ice sheets spanning the
past 6000 years show Antarctica repeatedly warming
when Greenland cooled, and vice versa (Fig. 1) [13, 14].
North-south oscillations of greater amplitude associated
with Dansgaard-Oeschger events are evident in oxygen-
isotope data from the Wurm-Wisconsin glaciation[15].
The phenomenon has been called the polar see-saw[15,
16], but that implies a north-south symmetry that is ab-
sent. Greenland is better coupled to global temperatures
than Antarctica is, and the fulcrum of the temperature
swings is near the Antarctic Circle. A more apt term for
the eﬀect is the Antarctic climate anomaly.

Attempts to account for it have included the hypoth-
esis of a south-ﬂowing warm ocean current crossing the
Equator[17] with a built-in time lag supposedly intended
to match paleoclimatic data. That there is no signiﬁ-
cant delay in the Antarctic climate anomaly is already

apparent at the high-frequency end of Fig. (1). While
mechanisms involving ocean currents might help to in-
tensify or reverse the eﬀects of climate changes, they are
too slow to explain the almost instantaneous operation
of the Antarctic climate anomaly.

The contrasts in temperature trends are not predicted
by variations in the concentrations of carbon dioxide and
other greenhouse gases. These gases diﬀuse throughout
the atmosphere as far as the South Pole. When they in-
crease, climate models predict simultaneous and strong
warming at both ends of the Earth. There is no direct
physical reason why this forcing should operate diﬀer-
ently in the two polar regions.

The simplest and most immediate explanation of the
Antarctic climate anomaly comes from cloud forcing. In
most climate models, clouds are passive participants re-
sponding to changes due to other forcing agents. If, on
the other hand, changes in cloudiness and GCR’s drive
the Earth’s climate[1, 2, 3] the Antarctic climate anomaly
is the exception that proves the rule.

Clouds warm the underlying surface by trapping the
outgoing long-wave radiation, and cool it by reﬂecting
the short-wave radiation from the Sun.
In general the
cooling eﬀect is greater than the heating eﬀect, resulting
in a net cooling of the Earth of the order of 15 W/m2.
A small percentage change in cloud cover can therefore
result in signiﬁcant forcing.

The cooling eﬀect is not evenly distributed. As shown
in Fig. (2 a) it is minimal around the Equator and in-
creases towards the mid-latitudes. In polar regions the
clouds can have a warming eﬀect if their re-radiation
of long-wave energy downwards dominates over the loss
of short-wave solar energy blocked by the clouds. This
warming has been well recorded on the surface in both
the Arctic and Antarctic[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

Figure (2a) also shows that the polar warming eﬀect
of clouds is not symmetrical, being most pronounced be-
yond 75◦S. In the Arctic it does no more than oﬀset the
cooling eﬀect, despite the fact that the Arctic is much
cloudier than the Antarctic (Fig. (2b)). The main rea-
son for the diﬀerence seems to be the exceptionally high

but is due to a smoothing of the older temperature records

The ERBE satellite data shown in Fig. (2) provide a
basis for computing the cooling and warming eﬀects of
small changes in cloud cover. The changes are assumed to
be the same at all latitudes. In order to achieve a forcing
that is independent of cloud fraction, the net cloud forc-
ing in Fig. (2) (a) is normalized with the cloud fraction
in Fig. (2) (b) to derive the cloud forcing at diﬀerent lati-
tudes for a 1 % increase in cloud fraction, as shown in red
in Fig. (2) (c). Finally, the blue curve in Fig. (2) (c) is a
simpliﬁed version of the cloud forcing used as (Fcloud(q))
in the calculation that follows. A simple model balances
incoming short-wave energy from the sun and outgoing
long-wave radiation, and allows diﬀusion of heat between
neighboring latitude bands. It takes the form[18]

c ∂tU (x, t) = ∂x(1 − x2)D(x)∂xU (x, t)
+QS(x)(1 − α(x)) − A − BU (x, t) − ∆0Fcloud(x)

where x = sin q and q is latitude. U (x, t) is the temper-
ature at latitude x = sin q, t is time, c is the heat ca-
pacitance, D(x) is an eddy diﬀusion constant that varies

constant (1370 W/m2), S(x) is the average fraction of

Note the saddle-point of the Antarctic climate anomaly at
latitude −63.

B = 1.7 W/m2◦C−1. Since Eq. (1) is solved for steady
state the value of c is not important and was set to 1
numerically. The procedure used, was to adjust the eddy
diﬀusion constant so both the model outgoing longwave
radiation[11, 12] and the model surface temperature, as
a function of latitude ﬁtted observations[19]. The results
of this procedure are shown in Fig. (2e) and Fig. (2g).

The calculated temperature changes in response to a
uniform variation of the cloud cover are shown in Fig. (3).
The sign of the response (warming or cooling) reverses at

latitude. The climate sensitivity of the model is
approximately γ = 0.5 W−1m2C. For an ± 4 % change
in cloud cover, the variation in temperature is about 2
◦C at +80 deg. and ≈ 1.5 C (opposite sign) at −80 deg.
Such changes can account for the temperature excursions
of 2◦C or less between Greenland and Antarctica during
the past 6000 years, shown in Fig. (1).

Figure (3) also predicts that a reduction in cloud cover
of about 8 % is suﬃcient to warm most of the globe by al-
most 2◦C, which is in line with other estimates of cloud
forcing during the 20th Century[1]. The eﬀect is seen
in the upper curve of Fig. (4a) (NASA-GISS data[20]).
In a cloud interpretation the hesitations and advances in
cloud reduction since 1900 follow the well-known changes
in solar activity[1, 21]. The lower curve in Fig. (4a) shows
the corresponding changes in Antarctica, and the oper-
ation of the Antarctic climate anomaly is plain to see.
Note especially the fall in Antarctic temperatures in the
1920s contrasting with a surge in global temperatures,
and the marked rise 1950–70 when global temperatures
fell.

Unfortunately there do not exist a record of cloud
cover that could verify the connection between clouds
and climate directly. However satellite data of Earths
cloud cover from the International Satellite Cloud Cli-
mate Project (ISCCP) covering 1983 – 2005 show that

FIG. 4: a: The Antarctic climate anomaly during the past
100 years is apparent in this comparison of the annual sur-
face temperature anomalies for the northern hemisphere and
Antarctica (64S-90S), from the NASA-GISS compilations.
The Antarctic data has been averaged over 12 years to min-
imize the temperature ﬂuctuations. The blue and red line
are fourth order polynomial ﬁt to the northern hemisphere
data and the Antarctica (64S-90S) data, respectively. If the

mial trendlines would cross and re-cross around 1910, 1955
and 1995, in the same manner as the millennial-scale curves
of the Antarctic climate anomaly in Fig. 1.
In the cloud-
forcing picture, the overall warming of the Antarctic during
the 20th Century is probably due to negative feedback from
the greenhouse action of increasing water vapor reaching the
polar atmosphere. b: Visualization of the Antarctic climate
anomaly using the NASA-GISS compilations of annual tem-
perature anomalies ∆T for 1903-2005 in 102 time intervals
and 8 zonal bands (±(90–64) ±(64–44) ±(44–24) ±(24–0)).
First, the linear trend in each zonal time series is removed.
Next, the data for the 102 time intervals in the Arctic se-
ries are arranged in descending order of ∆T on the right side
of the ﬁgure, poleward of 64 deg, between the black dotted
lines. Then the ∆T ’s for the corresponding time intervals
are plotted for each of the other zones. Finally the surface
is smoothed and contour lines of ∆T in 0C are added. Note
the N-S contrast in every time interval, and the topological
similarity to the computed cloud forcing in Fig. (3).

the large scale temporal variations are distributed fairly
evenly over the globe[3], and for example cloud variations
over oceans and clouds over Antarctica have similar tem-
poral evolution.

A remaining question about Fig. (4a) is how the

Antarctic temperatures were dragged upwards, to take
part in the general warming, despite the long-term re-
duction in cloud cover. A natural mechanism must be
in operation, because similar correspondences (though
in the context of an overall global cooling) are seen on
the millennial scale in the Greenland and Antarctic ice
temperatures in Fig. (1). The most likely explanation
is the diﬀusion of water vapor to the Antarctic atmo-
sphere, as a result of the increased capacity for water
vapor in warmer global atmosphere[22, 23]. The strong
natural greenhouse eﬀect of the additional water vapor
would amplify the eﬀect of cloud forcing globally (pos-
itive feedback) and over-ride it in Antarctica (negative
feedback).

Finally, it is possible to map zonally averaged NASA-
GISS temperature data for the past century so that the
Antarctic Climate Anomaly become apparent. By re-
moving the liner trend of the 8 zonal temperature bands
series covering the years 1903-2005, and subsequently
sort all the 8 temporal time series after the descending
temperatures of the 64-90 latitude band, Fig. (4b) is ob-
tained. This ﬁgure is very similar to Fig. (3), with a
saddle point structure in the souther hemisphere. In this
case the node of the saddle point seems to be at some-
what lower latitudes. This eﬀect could real and caused
by clouds over the ocean. A resent study found that pole-
ward of −58.75 (observational limit) had a heating eﬀect
on the surface over most of the year[10].

Cloud forcing is by far the most economical hypoth-
esis that explains the patterns of Fig. (1) and Fig. (4),
as well as the bigger see-saw eﬀects in Wurm-Wisconsin
times[15]. There is plainly scope for more detailed
modeling of the Antarctic climate anomaly on various
timescales.

Meanwhile, a chain of evidence appears to be complete,
which links low-level clouds to the well-known modula-
tion of galactic cosmic-ray intensity by solar magnetic
activity, to the detected inﬂuence of galactic cosmic rays
on cloudiness[1, 2, 3], and also to experimental evidence
that electrons set free by passing muons help to make
aerosols the pre-curser to cloud condensation nuclei at
low altitudes[4]. The roles of cosmic rays and clouds as
active players in climate change therefore merit closer at-
tention in general climate modeling and in solar and he-
liospheric physics, with special regard to the high-energy
galactic cosmic rays that ionize the lower atmosphere.
Physics history comes full circle. More than 100 years

ago, C.T.R. Wilson developed the cloud chamber to try
to understand natural clouds but he was diverted by his
detection of ionizing particles. In 1937 the ﬁrst known
muons turned up in a cloud chamber[24]. Now Wilson’s
initial purpose is fulﬁlled in a fresh understanding of the
physics of natural low-level clouds, and in the evidence
presented here for its relevance in the real world.

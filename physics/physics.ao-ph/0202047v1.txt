Abstract

Temperature ﬂuctuations in an atmospheric convective boundary
layer are investigated by means of Large Eddy Simulations (LES).
A novel statistical characterization for both weak temperature ﬂuc-
tuations and strong temperature ﬂuctuations has been found. De-
spite the nontriviality of the dynamics of temperature ﬂuctuations,
our data support the idea that the most relevant statistical properties
can be captured solely in terms of two scaling exponents, character-
izing the entire mixed layer. Such exponents control asymptotic (i.e.
core and tails) rescaling properties of the probability density functions
of equal-time temperature diﬀerences, ∆rθ, between points separated
by a distance r. A link between statistical properties of large tem-
perature ﬂuctuations and geometrical properties of the set hosting
such ﬂuctuations is also provided. Finally, a possible application of
our new ﬁndings to the problem of subgrid-scale parameterizations for
the temperature ﬁeld in a convective boundary layer is discussed.

1 Introduction

Temperature in an atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is typically convected
by a velocity background, v, and diﬀuses by the action of molecular motion

and/or small-scale turbulent eddies. The basic equation governing such a
process is the well-known advection-diﬀusion equation (Pielke, 1984) for the
(potential) temperature, θ,

∂tθ + vα∂αθ = D0∂2θ + Sθ

,

(1)

where Sθ represents the sources and sinks of heat, eventually present within
the domain, v is the velocity ﬁeld advecting the temperature, and D0 may
represent either the diﬀusion coeﬃcients or, alternatively, an eddy diﬀusion
coeﬃcient if one intends to focus on the large scale behavior (i.e. large eddies)
of θ and thus needs to parameterize, in some way, small scale temperature
dynamics. Repeated indexes are summed.
Here, we use the following short notations: ∂t ≡ ∂ • /∂t; ∂i ≡ ∂ • /∂xi,
i = 1, · · · , 3; ∂2 ≡

3
i=1 ∂i∂i•.

P

In many situations, temperature dynamics, driven by the velocity ﬁeld via
the advection term in Eq. (1), does not react back on the velocity ﬁeld. This
is the case, for instance, in a neutrally stratiﬁed boundary layer (occurring,
e.g., under windy conditions with a complete cloud cover) where buoyancy
forces are negligible compared to the other terms in the Navier-Stokes (NS)
equations ruling the velocity ﬁeld dynamics. In this case, temperature be-
haves as a passive scalar as a good approximation.
As a matter of fact, during the diurnal cycle neutral stratiﬁcation is rarely
observed in the ABL (Garratt, 1999). More frequently, one observes stable
conditions (occurring, e.g., at night in response to surface cooling by long-
wave emission to space) or unstable, convective, ones (occurring, e.g., when
strong surface heating produces thermal instability or convection). The role
of temperature is active in both cases, that amounts to say that temperature
drives the velocity ﬁeld dynamics through the buoyancy contribution (usu-
ally modeled by means of the well-known Boussinesq coupling). The latter
contribution is now the leading one in the NS equations.

The main feature characterizing both active and passive scalar dynamics
is the presence of strong ﬂuctuations in the temperature ﬁeld. Such ﬂuctua-
tions aﬀect the whole range of scales involved in the temperature dynamics,
from the largest scales of motion to the smallest ones where diﬀusive eﬀects
become important. This huge excitation of degrees of freedom, gives mean-
ing to the term “scalar turbulence” recently used to denote the dynamics of
temperature ﬂuctuations (Shraiman and Siggia, 2000).

The ﬁrst unpleasant consequence of persistent ﬂuctuations is the fail-
ure of any attempt to construct dimensional theories for the statistics of

2

temperature ﬂuctuations (Frisch, 1995), quantitatively deﬁned as tempera-
ture diﬀerences ∆rθ between points separated by r: ∆rθ ≡ θ(r, t) − θ(0, t).
The common strategy for dimensional approaches consists to deﬁne typical
length/time scales and typical amplitude for the ﬂuctuations of the unknown
ﬁelds (e.g., ∆rθ and ∆rv) and then try to balance the various terms in the
basic equations (e.g. Eq. (1) coupled to the NS equations) to deduce predic-
tions for ∆rθ and ∆rv as a function of the separation r.
This is, for instance, the essence of the ﬁrst dimensional theory for scalar
turbulence due to Kolmogorov, Obukhov and Corrsin (1949) and Bolgiano
(1959). As a result of these theories, probability density functions (pdfs),
P (∆rθ), of temperature diﬀerences, ∆rθ, obey the following simple rescal-
ing: P (∆rθ) = r−α ˜P (∆rθ/rα), where ˜P is a function of the sole ratio ∆rθ/rα.
Such property immediately implies that, dimensionally, one has ∆rθ ∼ rα
and, for the p-th moment of ∆rθ: h(∆rθ)pi ∼ rζp, with ζp (known as scaling
exponents) linear function of p: ζp = αp
The linearity of ζp vs p reﬂects the fact that only one parameter, α, is nec-
essary to explain most of the statistical properties of θ. One has, in other
words, ‘single-scale ﬂuctuations’; that amounts to say that it is irrelevant
which part of the probability density function of temperature diﬀerences is
sampled to deﬁne a typical ﬂuctuation.

Rather than the above simple scenario predicted by dimensional theories,
turbulent systems show an inﬁnite hierarchy of ‘independent’ ﬂuctuations
(Frisch, 1995), that amounts to say the strong dependence on the order p
considered to deﬁne the typical ﬂuctuation. More quantitatively, turbulent
systems exhibit a nonlinear behavior of ζp vs p1 where the inﬁnite set of expo-
nents, ζp, select diﬀerent classes of ﬂuctuations. The departure of the actual
curve of ζp vs p from the linear (dimensional) prediction is named “intermit-
tency” or “anomalous scaling” (Frisch, 1995). Intermittency is probably the
most representative property characterizing a turbulent system.

Our aim here is to provide a statistical characterization of temperature
ﬂuctuations in a convective boundary layer dominated by well-organized
plumes, simulated by a large eddy simulation model (Moeng, 1984).
We shall focus, in particular, on the statistical characterization of two diﬀer-
ent classes of ﬂuctuations: weak temperature ﬂuctuations, mainly occurring
in the inner plume regions and strong temperature ﬂuctuations, associated
1Such curve must be concave and not decreasing, as it follows from general inequalities

of probability theory (see, e.g., Frisch (1995)).

to the plume interfaces (see Fig. 1). As we shall show, weak ﬂuctuations are
associated to linear behavior of scaling exponents ζp vs p for small p’s, while
strong ﬂuctuations (captured by large p’s) cause the so-called intermittency
saturations, i.e. the curve ζp vs p tends a to a constant value, ζ∞, for p large
enough. The saturation exponent ζ∞ is simply connected (see Sec. 5.1.1)
to the fractal dimension of the set hosting large temperature excursions:
ζ∞ = d − DF , where d and DF are the usual dimension of the space and the
fractal dimension of the large temperature ﬂuctuation set, respectively.
Despite the complexity of temperature ﬂuctuation dynamics in a convective
boundary layer (CBL), reﬂected in the strong intermittency of the system,
only two exponents are necessary to capture most of the statistics of tem-
perature ﬂuctuations.
It is worth emphasizing that the same statistical characterization has been re-
cently found for two dimensional idealized models of both passive (see Frisch
et al (1999), Celani et al (2000) and Celani et al (2001a)) and active scalar
turbulence (see Celani et al (2001b)) simulated by means of both direct nu-
merical simulations and Lagrangian methods (see, e.g., Frisch et al (1998)).
This points toward the generality of our new ﬁndings within the context of
scalar transport.

2 Statistical tools

The aim of this section is to provide a quick summary of the statistical tools
we have exploited to characterize temperature ﬂuctuations in a CBL.
The basic and well-known indicator is the probability density function, P (∆r;xθ),
of temperature diﬀerences, ∆r;xθ, over a scale r, deﬁned as:

∆r;xθ ≡ θ(x + r, t) − θ(x, t)

.

(2)

The pdf P (∆r;xθ) will depend other than on r also on x if the system is not
homogeneous. In our CBL, we have homogeneity along x-y planes, but not
along the vertical direction z. We thus shall have a dependence on the vertical
coordinate z. Moreover, in the analysis of Sec. 5, separations r will be taken
along x-y planes in the direction forming an angle of π/4 with the geostrophic
wind direction. We shall thus denote our pdf simply as P (∆r;zθ). The choice
for the direction π/4 has been done in order to reduce the contamination
of the scaling exponents by anisotropic eﬀects. More details on this ‘magic’
angle can be found in Celani et al. (2001a).

By deﬁnition, weak ﬂuctuations (i.e. small values of |θ(x + r, t) − θ(x, t)|
with respect to a typical ﬂuctuation deﬁned as σ(z) ≡ [hθ2i − hθi2]1/2) are
associated to the pdf core while, on the contrary, large ﬂuctuations (i.e.
|θ(x + r, t) − θ(x, t)| ≫ σ(z)) are associated to the pdf tails.
The above considerations can be easily paraphrased in terms of the moments,
Sp(r; z) ≡ h(∆r;zθ)pi, known as structure functions. Large ﬂuctuations are
captured by large p’s, while weak ﬂuctuations by small p’s.

Let us now introduce two possible behaviors for the pdf P (∆r;zθ). As we
shall show in the sequel, such behaviors will characterize, within the entire
mixed layer, the statistical properties of weak temperature ﬂuctuations and
strong temperature ﬂuctuations, respectively.

Self-similar behavior

In terms of probability density functions of ∆r;zθ, such a behavior is

deﬁned by the rescaling property:

(5)

P (∆r;zθ) = r−α(z) ˜P

∆r;zθ
rα(z) (cid:19)

It can be immediately veriﬁed from the deﬁnition of moments:

Sp(r; z) =

P (∆r;zθ)(∆r;zθ)pd(∆r;zθ)

Z

−∞

that (3) is equivalent to the following behavior for the structure functions,
Sp:

Sp(r; z) ∼ rζ (z)

p with ζ (z)

p = α(z)p, α(z) > 0 ,

that is a linear behavior, with the factor α(z) in general depending on the
elevation z within the mixed layer.

It is worth noticing that (3) and (5) does not necessarily imply a Gaus-
sian shape for P (∆r;zθ). On the contrary, if P (∆r;zθ) is Gaussian then
(5) (and thus (3)) are immediately satisﬁed as it follows from the well-
known property of Gaussian statistics (see, e.g., Frisch (1995)): S2p(r; z) =
(2p − 1)!! [S2(r; z)]p, together with the assumption that S2(r; z) ∼ r2α(z).

Intermittency saturation (i.e. the strongest violation of dimensional pre-
dictions):

where Q is some function (not determined a priori) which does not depend
on the separation r.
In terms of cumulated probabilities, i.e. the sum (integral) of the pdfs over
the large temperature ﬂuctuations (i.e. for |∆r;zθ| > λσ(z), with λ > 1),
deﬁned as:

saturation is equivalent to the following power law behavior, holding for
diﬀerent values of λ > 1:

The scaling exponents, ζ (z)
slope of log

vs log r.
Finally, it is worth observing that, in terms of structure functions inter-

thus tend to a constant value ζ (z)

3 The Large-Eddy simulation model

In order to gather statistical informations on the turbulent structure of a
CBL, we used the LES code described in Moeng (1984) and Sullivan et al
(1994). Such model has been widely used and tested to investigate funda-
mental problems in the framework of boundary layers (see, e.g., Moeng and

6

Wyngaard (1989), Moeng et al. (1992), Andr´en and Moeng (1993), Moeng
and Sullivan (1994), among the others).
For this reason we conﬁne ourselves only on general aspects of the LES strat-
egy. Details can be found in the aforementioned references.

The key point of the LES strategy is that the large scale motion (i.e.
motion associated to the large turbulent eddies) is explicitly solved while
the smallest scales (typically in the inertial range of scales) are described
in a statistical consistent way (i.e. parameterized in terms of the resolved,
large scale, velocity and temperature ﬁelds). This is done by ﬁltering the
governing equations for velocity and potential temperature by means of a
ﬁlter operator. Applied, e.g., to the potential temperature ﬁeld θ, the ﬁlter
is deﬁned as the convolution:

where θ is the ﬁltered variable and G(x) is a tridimensional ﬁlter function.
The ﬁeld θ can be thus decomposed as

θ(x) =

θ(x′)G(x − x′)dx′

Z

θ = θ + θ′.

Applying the ﬁlter operator both to the Navier–Stokes equations and to the
equation for the potential temperature, and exploiting the decomposition
(11) (and the analogous for the velocity ﬁeld) in the advection terms one
obtains the corresponding ﬁltered equations. For the sake of brevity, we
report the sole ﬁltered equation for the potential temperature:

where τ (θ)

α are the subgrid turbulence ﬂuxes of virtual temperature (in short

KH being the SGS eddy coeﬃcient for heat. A similar expression holds
for the subgrid turbulence ﬂuxes of momentum (see Moeng, 1984) that are
deﬁned in terms of the SGS eddy coeﬃcient for momentum (KM ).
The above two eddy coeﬃcients are related to the velocity scale e′1/2

4 The simulated convective experiment

In the present ﬁrst study, our attention has been focused on the Simulation
B (hereafter referred to as Sim B) by Moeng and Sullivan (1994). Sim B is a
buoyancy-dominated ﬂow with a relatively small shear eﬀect, where vigorous
thermals (see again Fig. 1) set up due to buoyancy force.
The sole diﬀerence of our simulation with respect to the Moeng and Sullivan’s
simulation is the increased spatial resolution, here of 1283 grid points.
A preliminary sensitivity test at the lower resolution 963 (as in Moeng and
Sullivan (1994)) did not show signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the results we are
going to present. Sensitivity tests at higher resolutions are still in progress
and seem to conﬁrm our preceding conclusion.

Our choice for a convective boundary layer lies on the fact that, in such
regimes, dependence of resolved ﬁelds on SGS parameterization should be
very weak, and thus LES strategy appears completely justiﬁed. Indeed, in
convective regimes, SGS motion acts as net energy sinks that drain energy
from the resolved motion. This is another way to say that energy blows from
large scales of motion toward the smallest scales and the cumulative (statisti-
cal) eﬀect of the latter scales can be successfully captured by means of simple
eddy-diﬀusivity/viscosity SGS models. Uncertainties eventually present at
the smallest scales directly aﬀected by SGS parameterizations (that are not
the concern of the analysis we are going to show) do not propagate upward
but are promptly diﬀuse (and thus dissipated) owing to the action of the
aforementioned eddy-diﬀusivity/viscosity character of SGS motion. Genuine
inertial range dynamics can thus develop and, as we shall see, the typical
features characterizing an inertial range of scales (e.g., rescaling properties
of statistical objects) to appear.

The following parameters characterize the Sim B. Geostrophic wind, Ug =
10 m/s; friction velocity, u∗ = 0.56 m/s; convective velocity, w∗ = 2.02 m/s;
PBL height, zi = 1030 m; large-eddy turnover time, τ∗ = 510 s; stability

8

parameter, zi/L = −18 (L being the Monin–Obukov length); potential tem-
perature ﬂux at the surface, Q∗ = 0.24 mK/s.
Moreover, the numerical domain size in the x, y and z directions are Lx =
Ly = 5 km and Lz = 2 km, respectively; the time step for the numerical
integration is about 1 s. For details on the simulated experiment, readers
can refer to Moeng and Sullivan (1994).

To perform our statistical analysis, we ﬁrst reached the quasi-steady state.
It took, as in Moeng and Sullivan (1994), about six large-eddy turnover
times, τ∗. After that time, a new simulation has been made for about 37τ∗
and the simulated potential temperature ﬁeld saved at 0.5τ∗ intervals for the
analysis. Our data set was thus formed by 74 (almost independent) potential
temperature snapshots.

Each simulation hour required about 24 computer hours on an Alpha-

XP1000 workstation.

5 Results and discussions

5.1 Statistics of large temperature ﬂuctuations

Let us start our statistical analysis from the large temperature ﬂuctuations.
These are controlled by the pdf tails of temperature diﬀerences, ∆r;zθ, and,
as we are going to show, they are compatible with the laws (6) and (8), that
means intermittency saturation.
To show that, it is enough to see whether or not there exist a positive number,
∞ , such that the quantities σ(z)P (∆r;zθ)r−ζ (z)
ζ (z)
∞ collapse on the same curve,
Q, for diﬀerent values of the separation r. Indeed, as showed in Sec. 2, in
the presence of saturation the function Q, appearing in (6), does not depend
on r.
The validity of (6) can be seen in Fig. 2, where the behavior of P (∆r;zθ) for
z/zi = 0.3 and two values of r are shown, z and zi being the elevation above
the bottom boundary and the mixed layer height, respectively. In the graph
(a), P (∆r;zθ) is reported without any r-dependent rescaling; in (b) we show
σ(z)P (∆r;zθ)r−ζ (z)
∞ ∼ 0.6. The data collapse occurring on the tails of
the curves of graph (b) is the footprint of intermittency saturation.
In Figs. 3 and 4 we show the analogous of Fig. 2 but for z/zi = 0.45 and
z/zi = 0.6. Also in these cases, the exponent giving the data collapse is
ζ (z)
∞ ∼ 0.6. Similar behaviors have been observed for all z’s within the mixed

∞ for ζ (z)

9

layer.
As a conclusion, from the evidences of Figs. 2, 3 and 4, it turns out that the
saturation exponent ζ (z)
∞ does not depend on z within the mixed layer. It
is thus a property of the entire mixed layer and, for this reason, it will be
simply denoted by ζ∞.

Let us now corroborate the scenario of intermittency saturation by look-

ing at the cumulated probability (7).
For the saturation to occur, such probability has to behave as a power law
with exponent ζ∞ (see (8)). Such behavior is indeed observed and showed in
Fig. 4(a) (for z/zi = 0.3 and λ = 5 and 5.5) and in Fig. 4(b) (for z/zi = 0.6
and λ = 5 and 5.5). The continuous lines have the slope ζ∞ ∼ 0.6 as mea-
sured from Figs. 2 and 3. The fact that there exist a region of scales, r, where
that slope is parallel to the slope of the cumulated probabilities means, again,
intermittency saturation with a unique (i.e. characterizing the whole mixed
layer) exponent.
It is worth noting that ﬁgures similar to Figs. 5(a) and 5(b) have been ob-
tained also for smaller values of λ, e.g., λ = 2.5 and λ = 3.5. Population of
strong events being decreasing as λ increases, the above independence on λ
points for the robustness of our statistics.

In Fig. 6(a) we report, for z/zi = 0.45, the behaviors of the sixth and
eight-order structure functions of temperature diﬀerences vs the separation
between points (squares). Stright lines have the slope ζ∞ = 0.6. This is
a further, direct, evidence of intermittency saturation. To investigate the
statistical convergence of our sixth and eight-order moments, we reported in
Fig. 6(b) the bulk contribution to such moments: (∆rθ)pP (∆rθ), with p = 6
and p = 8, r/L ∼ 7 × 10−2 in the inertial range of scales. For comparison
P (∆rθ) is also shown. Note that the maximum contribution to the moments
six and eight comes from ﬂuctuations ∆rθ in the region where P (∆rθ) (i.e.,
p = 0) is well resolved, i.e., our statistics appears reliable up to the order
eight.

Once ζ∞ is known, we evaluated from (6) the unknown function Q. Such
function is shown in Fig. 7 for two diﬀerent values of z within the mixed layer.
Diﬀerences among the two curves are evident, signaling that Q contains a
dependence on the elevation z. Such dependence can be associated to the
relatively small shear present in our convective simulation (see Sec. 4) .
Further simulations spanning intermediate ABL (i.e. where both shear and
buoyancy are important) have however to be performed in order to conﬁrm
the above last conclusion.

10

It is worth stressing that the scales r at which we observe scaling behaviors
are always larger than ∼ 8 grid-points (i.e. suﬃciently far from the scales
directly aﬀected by SGS parameterizations). Our attention being focused in
a region suﬃciently far from boundaries, this is another point in favor for
the possible SGS independence of our results.

5.1.1 A link between geometry and statistics

Let us now conclude this section with a geometric point of view for the in-
termittency saturation (see also Celani et al, 2001a). As we shall see, the
saturation exponent ζ∞ is related to the fractal dimension, DF , of the set
hosting the strong temperature ﬂuctuations.
To do that, let us schematize in a very rough way our strong (i.e. larger
than some σ(z)) temperature ﬂuctuations in the form of quasi-discontinuities
(i.e. step functions). Each quasi-discontinuity will deﬁne a point (we are
performing the analysis on planes at constant z) of given coordinate in our
two-dimensional plane. The ensemble of all points deﬁnes the set, S, hosting
strong temperature ﬂuctuations. Roughly, S is formed by the intersection
of our two-dimensional plane with the plume interfaces across which strong
temperature jumps occur.
A useful indicator to characterize geometrically our set, S, is the fractal
dimension, DF , (see, e.g., Frisch (1995) for a presentation oriented toward
turbulence problems). We brieﬂy recall the standard way to deﬁne DF .

• Take boxes of side, r, and cover the whole plane at ﬁxed z. Denote

with Ntot the total number of those boxes;

• Deﬁne the function N(r) as the number of boxes containing at least

one point of S;

• For r suﬃciently small, one expects power law behavior for N(r) in the

form: N(r) ∼ r−DF , which deﬁnes the fractal dimension of S.

Given the fractal dimension, DF , it is now easy to compute the probability,
P rob[|∆r;zθ| > λσ(z)], of having strong (i.e. larger than some σ(z)) tempera-
ture jumps within a certain distance r. Indeed, by deﬁnition, we have:

P rob[|∆r;zθ| > λσ(z)] ≡

From (8) and (9) the identiﬁcation ζ∞ = 2 − DF immediately follows. Notice
that if one does not restrict the attention on the sole planes at constant z,
but focuses on the whole three dimensional space, the above relation becomes
ζ∞ = 3 − D′

F is the fractal dimension of the new set S.

5.2 Statistics of weak temperature ﬂuctuations

Let us now pass to investigate the statistics of well-mixed regions of the
temperature ﬁeld, corresponding to the inner parts of plumes that are likely
to be present in our CBL (see again Fig. 1).
In these regions, ﬂuctuations turn out to be very gentle and, as an immediate
consequence, statistics is expected to be controlled in terms of single-scale
ﬂuctuations (see the Introduction). The best candidate to characterize, from
a statistical point of view, weak ﬂuctuations is thus the rescaling form given
by (3).
To investigate whether or not our data are compatible with such rescaling, it
is enough to verify whether there exist a number, α(z), (a priori dependent
on the elevation z within the mixed layer) such that, looking at rα(z)P (∆r;zθ)
vs ∆r;zθ/rα(z) for diﬀerent values of r, all curves collapse one on the other for
each value of z.
Our data support this behavior for the pdf cores (as expected, the rescaling
(3) holds solely for weak ﬂuctuations), as it can be observed in Fig. 2(c) (for
z/zi = 0.3), in Fig. 3(c) (for z/zi = 0.45) and Fig. 4(c) (for z/zi = 0.6). In
all cases, the values of α(z) is ∼ 0.2, that means that α(z) does not depend on
z. As the exponent ζ∞, α ≡ α(z) thus characterizes the entire mixed layer.

6 Conclusions and discussions

We have characterized, from a statistical point of view, both large and weak
temperature ﬂuctuations of a convective boundary layer simulated by a large
eddy simulation model.
The main results of our study can be summarized as follows.

• Large temperature ﬂuctuations, occurring across plume interfaces, turn
out to be strongly intermittent. This is the cause of the observed break
down of mean ﬁeld theories ´a la Kolmogorov, predicting a linear be-
havior of the scaling exponents, ζp, of the structure functions of tem-
perature diﬀerences, vs the order p. We found, on the contrary, a

12

pdf rescaling which corresponds to a nonlinear shape of ζp vs p, with
ζp → ζ∞ ≡ const for p large enough. This behavior is named intermit-
tency saturation, i.e. the strongest violation of dimensional predictions.
it is
Hence, the concept of ‘typical ﬂuctuation’ does not make sense:
necessary to specify which part of the pdf of temperature diﬀerences is
sampled for the deﬁnition of ‘typical ﬂuctuation’.

• Weak temperature ﬂuctuations, characterizing the inner plume region
where temperature is extremely well-mixed, have a self-similar charac-
ter. This amounts to say that, despite the fact that many scales are
excited in the well-mixed regions, the concept of ‘typical ﬂuctuation’
here makes sense. In this case a simple rescaling characterizes the pdf
core, which corresponds to a linear behavior of the curve ζp vs p for
small p’s. The slope of the straight line ζp vs p is α ∼ 0.2.

• Exponents α and ζ∞ appear to be independent on the elevation within
the mixed layer. They are thus an intrinsic property of the entire mixed
layer.

• Statistics and geometry turn out to be intimately related. A simple
relationship holds indeed between ζ∞ and the fractal dimension, DF ,
of the set hosting the large temperature ﬂuctuations: ζ∞ = d − DF
where d is the usual dimension of the physical space.
As for ζ∞, DF appears an intrinsic, i.e. z-independent, property of the
entire mixed layer.

It is worth stressing that the present scenario holds also for idealized,
two-dimensional, models of scalar turbulence both passive (see Frisch et al
(1999), Celani et al (2000) and Celani et al (2001a)) and active (see Celani
et al (2001b)), simulated by means of direct numerical simulations. This
fact naturally points toward the possible generality of the present statistical
characterization for the entire class of scalar transport problems.

Finally, let us discuss a possible application of our results within boundary
layer physics, and, more speciﬁcally, in the LES approach. As well known,
one of the most challenging problem in the LES strategy is to ﬁnd a proper
way to describe the dynamical eﬀect of small-scale unresolved motion on the
resolved large scale dynamics. Recently, new approaches have emerged as
alternatives to the eddy viscosity and similarity models (see, e.g., Meneveau
and Katz, 2000). They construct the small-scale unresolved part of a total

13

ﬁeld (e.g., the velocity ﬁeld) by extrapolating properties of the (resolved)
coarse-grained ﬁeld. A speciﬁc form for the subgrid scale ﬁeld is thus postu-
lated exploiting scale-invariance (i.e. inertial range scaling behavior) of the
coarse-grained ﬁeld. Note that, standard approaches postulate the form of
the stress tensor rather than the structure of the unresolved ﬁeld.
The mathematical tool which permits to perform such an interpolation is
known as “fractal interpolation” (see Meneveau and Katz (2000) and refer-
ences therein) where the free parameter of the theory is the fractal dimension
of the ﬁeld.
Up to now, many eﬀorts have been devoted to exploit such strategy for the
velocity ﬁelds. The latter exhibit however a multifractal structure (roughly
speaking, an inﬁnite set of fractal dimensions characterizes the whole ﬁeld)
and thus the fractal dimension parameter is a sort of ‘mean ﬁeld’ description.
The suggestion arising from our results is that the same technique exploited
for the velocity ﬁeld appears successfully applicable in the convective case to
the temperature ﬁeld as well. Indeed, our results support a fractal structure
of the temperature ﬁeld. The situation seems to be even better than that
for the velocity ﬁeld. As we have stressed in the preceding sections, solely
two exponents characterize most of the statistical properties of temperature
ﬂuctuations. We thus propose to schematize temperature ﬂuctuations as a
bi-fractal object (i.e., the simplest multifractal object) described by our two
exponents α and ζ∞, and to generalize “fractal interpolation” to this case.
To do that, it seems necessary to investigate how the exponents we found
for the analyzed experiment change by varying, e.g., the weight of buoyancy
with respect to shear. We are currently working on this point and, as far
as we remain on convective experiments, it seems that only small variations
appear.
It should also be interesting to investigate what happens to the above sce-
nario in stable stratiﬁed boundary layers. In that cases LES approach appears
more delicate than in a CBL. Observations in ﬁeld and/or in a wind tunnel
should be thus necessary to investigate the problem.

List of Figures

1. A typical snapshot of the potential temperature ﬁeld θ, in the quasi-
steady state of a convective boundary layer simulated by a Large Eddy
Simulation with resolution 1283. Above: vertical cross-section restricted
to the mixed layer; below: horizontal cross-section inside the mixed
layer. Colors are coded according to the intensity of the ﬁeld: white
corresponds to large temperature, black to small ones. Plumes and
well-mixed regions are clearly detectable.

2. The pdf’s P (∆r;zθ), for two values of r inside the inertial range of scales
(dotted lines: r/L = 0.22; continuous line: r/L = 0.11, L being the
side of the (squared) simulation domain) and z/zi = 0.3, zi being the
elevation of the mixed layer top. (a): pdf’s are shown without any
r-dependent rescaling; (b) the pdf is multiplied by the factor σ(z)r−ζ∞
with ζ∞ ∼ 0.6: the collapse of the curves indicate the asymptotic
behavior P (∆r;zθ) ∼ rζ∞ for large ∆r;zθ, that means saturation of
temperature scaling exponents (see, and (6), (8) and (9)); (c) pdf’s
are multiplied by the factor rα(z) while ∆r;zθ by r−α(z): the collapse of
pdf cores indicates the validity of (3) that is equivalent to the linear
behavior of low-order temperature scaling exponents (see (4)).

3. As in Fig. 2 but for z/zi = 0.45.

4. As in Fig. 2 but for z/zi = 0.6.

5. The cumulated probabilities P rob[|∆r;zθ| > λσ(z)] for two values of λ
are shown for (a): z/zi = 0.3 and (b): z/zi = 0.6. The slope of these
curves (continuous line) are compatible with the exponent ζ∞ ∼ 0.6.
The error bar on this slope is of the order of 0.1, evaluated by means
of the local scaling exponents (on half-decade ratios) as customary in
turbulence data analysis.

6. (a) Sixth and eight-order structure functions of temperature diﬀerences
vs the separation between points (squares). Stright lines have the slope
ζ∞ = 0.6. (b) The bulk contribution to the moments p = 6 and p = 8,
(∆rθ)pP (∆rθ), with r/L ∼ 1.1 × 10−1 in the inertial range of scales.
For comparison P (∆rθ) (i.e.
for p = 0) is also shown. Note that
the maximum contribution to the moments six and eight comes from

18

ﬂuctuations ∆rθ in the region where P (∆rθ) is well resolved. This
proves the reliability of our statistics to compute moments up to the
order eight.

7. The function Q deﬁned in (6) is shown for two diﬀerent values of z
within the mixed layer: z/zi = 0.3 (dotted line) and z/zi = 0.6 (con-
tinuous line). Diﬀerences in the shape of these two curves, reveal that
Q contains a dependence on the elevation, z, within the mixed layer.

Universality and Scale Invariance in Hourly Rainfall

Abstract: We show that the hourly rainfall rate distribution can be de-
scribed by a simple power law to a good approximation. We show that the
exponent of the distribution in tropics is universal and is equal to 1.13 ±0.11.
At higher latitudes the exponent increases and is found to lie in the range
1.3-1.6.

It is well known that daily rainfall over a localized region displays an
almost chaotic behavior [1]. This implies that it is very diﬃcult to make
even short term prediction of daily rainfall. The distribution of daily rainfall
amount over a localized region is also well known to have a very large tail
which implies that there is very high probability to have very large rainfall.
The distribution shows considerable deviation from the normal distribution.
In the present paper we analyze the distribution of hourly rainfall amount.
We are particularly interested in determining whether we can identify some
universal features in the rainfall distribution which are observed at all spatial
locations. The nature of distribution can also reveal some underlying features
of the dynamical system. For example, it has been argued that dissipative
systems with large number of variable tend to reach a critical state under the
inﬂuence of an external perturbation. In the critical state the system displays
an almost chaotic behavior with ﬂuctuations displaying scale invariant power
law distribution. This has been demonstrated numerically by postulating
simpliﬁed models of the behavior of sand piles, earthquakes etc [2, 3]. The
mechanism by which the dynamical systems achieve the critical state under
the inﬂuence of external perturbation is called the self organized criticality
[2, 3]. In the present paper we shall determine if the rainfall rate also displays
this behavior by studying its distribution. Some preliminary results of this
study have been presented in Ref. [4].

The data is taken from the http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov web site and consists
of SSM/I satellite data. The data consists of rainfall rate in units of mm/hour
with the minimum rate equal to 0.1 mm/hour. It is available over the entire
globe on a grid size of half a degree both in latitude and longitude. We
extracted the data ﬁles from this website for the year 1997 for three diﬀerent

1

time periods. At diﬀerent times the data is available at diﬀerent locations.
We randomly selected a total of 97 diﬀerent locations on the globe out of the
extracted data. In order that a reasonable amount of data is available for
a given region, we group the rainfall data in intervals of 5 degrees both in
latitude and longitude. The typical distribution for several diﬀerent regions
are shown in Fig. 1 and 2. We represent the power law distribution as

f (x) = a/xb

(1)

where x is equal to the hourly rainfall amount in mm and a and b are param-
eters. If the underlying dynamical system is in a critical state then we expect
that certain observables in the system will follow a power law distribution.
The rainfall amount per hour represents an interesting physical observable
which we study in this paper.

We point out that while testing for a power law behaviour we are not
testing the hypothesis that the distribution is a power law over the entire
interval of rainfall per hour. The power law is expected to be valid only
in some intermediate range of rainfall. At low as well as large rainfall we
expect that the distribution will be distorted in comparison to a pure power
behavior. At very large rainfall, for example, we expect the distribution
to decay very rapidly since rainfall amounts larger than a certain value are
physically not possible. We, therefore, cut oﬀ the distribution at some large
value as well as at a low value of the rainfall. At the low rainfall value we
make the distribution constant below a certain value xmin, which is treated
as an additional parameter of the distribution. At the large rainfall end we
put a cut on the data so as to exclude all data with x > xmax = 10 mm/hr.
The number of data points in the excluded region are typically found to be
very small. The distribution is set equal to zero beyond x = xmax. The power
distribution, therefore, contains two adjustable parameters b and xmin. The
parameter a is obtained by normalization of the distribution.

We compare the ﬁt obtained by the power law distribution with an alter-

native exponential distribution

g(x) = α exp(−βx)

(2)

In analogy with the power distribution, g(x) is also set equal to zero for
x > xmax. Hence the normalization α for this distribution is equal to β/(1 −
βxmax). We point out that we are not interested in ﬁnding the best possible
distribution that describes the data. We are only interesting in demonstrating

2

that a power law provides a good description of the data over a wide range of
rainfall amounts. Hence we have not made extensive comparisons of various
distributions and compare the power law only to a simple exponential ﬁt.

In Fig. 1 and 2 we show the ﬁts in several representative cases. The ﬁgure
shows the power as well as the exponential ﬁt to the rainfall distribution. It
is clear from these plots that a power distribution ﬁts the data reasonably
well.
It can also be seen that the ﬁt is much better at lower latitudes in
comparison to the higher latitudes. The log likelihood diﬀerence, deﬁned to
be the diﬀerence of the log likelihood for the power ﬁt and the exponential
ﬁt, is generally found to lie in the range 50 to 150 in tropics and between
10 to 30 at the higher latitudes. Hence the power distribution gives an
overall much better description of the data in comparison to an exponential
distribution. In Fig. 3 and 4 we show a scatter plot of the exponent of the
power distribution as a function of the latitude and longitude respectively.
The error in the exponent values ranges from 0.02 to 0.1 in most cases. Only
rarely does the error exceeds 0.1. The precise value depends on the number
of data points obtained in each region which typically range from 100 to
2000. We also point out that the uneven distribution of the data points as
a function of latitude and longitude is caused by our selection of times for
which the data is extracted. However this does not have any inﬂuence on
our results or conclusions since the data is spread over the entire globe.

We clearly see that the values of the exponent b are diﬀerent at lower
latitudes in comparison to higher latitudes. The exponent close to equator
is found to be close to unity whereas at higher latitudes the exponent is
much larger. The exponent does not show very signiﬁcant dependence on
the longitude. Only a very marginal relationship is found after eliminating
one outlier with a very large value of the exponent.
In order to quantify
the dependence of the exponent on the latitude we evaluate the correlation
between the absolute value of the latitude and the exponent. For the entire
set of 97 data points the correlation ρ = 0.54. If we delete two outliers the
correlation goes up to ρ = 0.608. The probability p that we can get this
correlation from a random sample is very small. We ﬁnd that for the entire
set p = 10−5% and after eliminating the two outliers p = 3 × 10−7%.

The fact that at lower latitude the exponent values are clustered around
unity irrespective of longitude is a clear indication of a universal behaviour
in the rainfall distributions in the tropics. By putting a cut on the latitude
in order to select only the region that lies between 20 N and 20 S we ﬁnd

3

that the mean value of the exponent b, deﬁned in Eq. 1, is given by,

b = 1.13 ± 0.11

(3)

The total number of data points contained within the latitude 20 N and 20 S
are equal to 61. Two of these points were found to give an anomalously large
values of the exponent compared to the rest and were treated as outliers.
The mean value given in Eq. 3 is obtained after eliminating these outliers.
The median value of the exponent is equal to 1.12 and remains unchanged
with or without the inclusion of the outliers.

As this work was near completion we became aware of Ref. [5] where the
authors have analyzed high-resolution rainfall data at Baltic coast Zingst in
order to investigate its distribution. The authors ﬁnd that the distribution
is well described by a power law with exponent 1.36. Our results are in
agreement with their ﬁndings since at higher latitudes we also ﬁnd similar
exponents.

In conclusion, we summarize the main results of the paper. We have
shown that the hourly rainfall distribution is well described by a scale in-
variant power law. This is particularly true in the tropical region where the
exponent is found to be 1.13 ± 0.11 independent of the longitude. As we go
towards the higher latitudes the exponent increases and generally is found
to lie in a range 1.3-1.6. The power dependence and its universal character
in the tropics indicates that the underlying dynamical system may be best
describable in terms of self organized criticality.

SUMMARY

The radar scattering properties of realistic aggregate snowﬂakes have been calculated using the Rayleigh-
Gans theory. We ﬁnd that the effect of the snowﬂake geometry on the scattering may be described in terms of
a single universal function, which depends only on the overall shape of the aggregate and not the geometry or
size of the pristine ice crystals which compose the ﬂake. This function is well approximated by a simple analytic
expression at small sizes; for larger snowﬂakes we ﬁt a curve to our numerical data. We then demonstrate how
this allows a characteristic snowﬂake radius to be derived from dual-wavelength radar measurements without
knowledge of the pristine crystal size or habit, while at the same time showing that this detail is crucial to
using such data to estimate ice water content. We also show that the ‘effective radius’, characterising the ratio
of particle volume to projected area, cannot be inferred from dual-wavelength radar data for aggregates. Finally,
we consider the errors involved in approximating snowﬂakes by ‘air-ice spheres’, and show that for small enough
aggregates the predicted dual wavelength ratio typically agrees to within a few percent, provided some care is
taken in choosing the radius of the sphere and the dielectric constant of the air-ice mixture; at larger sizes the
radar becomes more sensitive to particle shape, and the errors associated with the sphere model are found to
increase accordingly.

INTRODUCTION

Aggregation plays an important role in the evolution of ice clouds and the devel-
opment of precipitation. Understanding the geometry and size distribution of ice ag-
gregates is crucial to analysing radar returns and interpreting them in terms of particle
size and ice water content. A recent study (Westbrook et al 2004a,b) presented a new
theoretical model of ice crystal aggregation which produced ‘synthetic’ snowﬂakes with
realistic geometry and distribution by size; sample aggregates from those simulations are
shown in ﬁgure 1, alongside images of real aggregates from a cirrus cloud. This model
includes no a priori assumptions about the relationship between snowﬂake mass and
dimension, or about the distribution by size. The results from this study show that many
of the features of the resulting aggregate snowﬂakes are universal – that is to say that
they do not dependend on the shape or initial size distribution of the pristine ice crystals
which make up the ﬂakes.

The purpose of this paper is to calculate the radar scattering properties of these
synthetic aggregates and to consider how the results may be used to interpret dual
wavelength radar data in terms of average particle size and ice water content. We
identify a number of features in the scattering behaviour of the snowﬂakes which are
universal and, equally importantly, a number of features which are not. These results
have signiﬁcant implications for the estimation of the microphysical properties of ice
clouds from radar data. We also consider the errors involved in modelling the aggregates
as spherical ice/air mixtures, and in particular what size sphere should be used in place
of the aggregate it is intended to represent.

2. AGGREGATION MODEL

Here we present a brief overview of the Westbrook et al (2004a,b) model, and the
key results from it. The model is based on the rate of hydrodynamic capture between
two spheres, well known in the raindrop coalescence literature:

Γij =

(Di + Dj)2

vi −
|

vj|

,

π

(1)

(2)

where D is the maximum particle dimension and v is the fall speed. Unlike raindrops,
snowﬂakes are clearly not spherical: in order to accurately sample collisions between
the complicated aggregate shapes we use Γij as a rate of ‘close approach’ between the
two particles i and j. We pick pairs of particles at random with a probability proportional
to Γij, so as to choose two that are likely to undergo a collision. We then track the pair
along one of the possible trajectories that the collision area π
4 (Di + Dj)2 encompasses.
If a collision occurs, the particles are stuck together rigidly at the point of initial contact;
if the pair miss one another, they are returned to the system and a new pair is picked. In
this way we correctly sample the collision rates between the complex aggregates.

The model is completed by an explicit form for the particle fall speeds, and this is

where mg is the particle weight and r is a characteristic radius (see below). The
parameter α governs the hydrodynamic regime: here we assume an approximately

2 . The air enters the expression through its density ρ and its
kinematic viscosity νk. The characteristic radius in equation 2 is the radius of gyration
(see appendix A); however systematically replacing r with the maximum dimension D
(as per Mitchell) does not affect the results described here. Our computer simulations
show that r

3. SNOWFLAKE GEOMETRY AND SIZE DISTRIBUTION

The aggregate snowﬂakes produced by the model have a fractal geometry (in a
statistical sense). Consequently the ﬂakes have a rather open structure, with a power law
relationship between mass and radius:

m = ardf .

(3)

where the exponent df is the fractal dimension and has value of less than three. This
kind of power law scaling has been widely reported in the literature, usually with
an exponent of around two (eg. Heymsﬁeld et al 2002: df = 2.04 for aggregates of
bullet-rosettes, df = 2.08 for aggregates of side-planes; Locatelli and Hobbs 1974:
df = 1.9 for aggregates of plates, side-planes, bullets and columns; Mitchell 1996:
df = 2.1 for aggregates of side-planes, columns and bullets). This tallies well with our
0.1, and our theoretical arguments
simulation results where we measure df = 2.05
(see Westbrook et al 2004b) which lead to the prediction df = 1/(1

α) = 2.

Crucially this asymptotic scaling is determined purely by the hydrodynamic regime
and not the initial conditions (pristine crystal type or size). These details do have an
affect on how quickly the asymptotic regime is approached, but as ﬁgure 2 illustrates, in
general only a few collisions are needed before equation 3 applies.

and 5000 with twice that weight. In the right hand panel we plot mξ
avn(m, t) against m/mav to show that all
three are in fact the same underlying distribution φ rescaled as a function of mav. For our simulations total mass

where we deﬁne the weight average mass mav(t) =
m and ξ is a positive
constant. The function φ describes the underlying distribution shape and its form is in
principle sensitive only to the value of α in the velocity law (2). As the aggregation
progresses, the average mass mav increases, stretching the distribution whilst reducing
the overall concentration through the factor m−ξ
av . Equation 4 reﬂects the idea that
there is a single underlying distribution which is rescaled depending on how far the
aggregation has evolved (as characterised by the average aggregate mass mav).

To test this ‘dynamical scaling’ we measured n(m, t) at three different points in the
evolution of our simulations, and plot mξ
avn(m, t) as a function of m/mav in each case.
The results are shown in ﬁgure 3 and the data points from each of the three distributions
collapse onto a single curve, conﬁrming equation 4. This result has also been conﬁrmed
using experimental size spectra from a cirrus cloud — see Westbrook et al (2004a,b) for
details.

In summary, the crucial results (backed up by experimental data) are that the rela-
tionship between mass and linear dimension takes a power law scaling, with a universal
exponent determined by the physics of the aggregation process, and a non-universal
prefactor which is sensitive to both the pristine crystal type and size. In addition, the
aggregate size distribution is described by a universal underlying distribution function,
which is simply rescaled as a function of the average particle mass as the aggregation
proceeds.

4. RADAR CROSS SECTIONS OF INDIVIDUAL AGGREGATES

(a) The Rayleigh-Gans theory

In this section the back scattered intensity from a single snowﬂake is calculated
using the Rayleigh-Gans theory. The essence of this approximation is that the particle
is split up into a number of small volume elements dv at position r relative to the
overall centre of mass. Each element is treated as a Rayleigh scatterer, and we ignore

RADAR SCATTERING BY AGGREGATE SNOWFLAKES

any interactions between the elements (each one sees only the applied incident wave).
Summing up the contributions from each of them with an appropriate phase factor, the
radar cross section of the complete particle is obtained (see Bohren and Huffman 1983):

Here ρice and ǫ are the density and dielectric constant of (solid) ice respectively, ˆez is
the direction of propagation of the incident wave, and k = 2π/λ.

The form factor f represents the deviation from the Rayleigh regime as the overall
size of the particle and the wavelength of the incident light become comparable. In
the Rayleigh limit where the particle is much smaller than the wavelength, f = 1, and
m2λ−4 dependence. As the particle
the radar cross section (5) takes the well known
size increases relative to the wavelength, the form factor falls off with a functional
dependance which, in general, depends on the geometry of the particle whose volume is
being integrated over in equation 6.

∝

The key advantage of the Rayleigh-Gans approach is it allows the scattering cross
section for a particle of any shape to be calculated, provided the particle is not too
large or too strong a dielectric. Unlike the discrete dipole approximation (Purcell
and Pennypacker 1973; Draine and Flatau 1994), the coupling between the elements
is neglected, and this places constraints on its applicability. In particular, Bohren

fractal aggregates (such as our snowﬂakes), Berry and Percival (1986) have shown that
these conditions may be signiﬁcantly relaxed. Their calculations show that because

aggregate, and for df > 2 only becomes signiﬁcant when the number monomers per
aggregate becomes of order (kr0)−df /(df −2). Thus provided that multiple scattering

The pristine crystal geometry may also play a role in determining the range of appli-
cability of the Rayleigh-Gans theory. Since all interaction between the scatterers (which
are assumed to act as equivalent volume Rayleigh spheres) is ignored, the anisotropy of
the monomer particles is implicitly neglected. However, Liu and Illingworth (1997) have
studied the scattering from a quite elongated hexagonal ice crystal (aspect ratio=3), and

acceptable approximation, provided that they are small enough compared to the incident
radar wavelength.

(b) The form factor

It is apparent from equations 5 and 6 that outside the Rayleigh limit the radar
cross section is sensitive to both particle size and shape through the form factor f . For
every aggregate produced in our simulations, equation (6) was evaluated for a range of

to yield the curve in ﬁgure 4a.

Given our results on the universality of aggregate snowﬂake geometry, we anticipate
that the form factor will also be independent of the details of the monomer crystals: in
ﬁgure 4b we illustrate this point by varying the aspect ratio of the pristine crystals and
measuring an almost identical form factor.

We now compare the form factor of our aggregate snowﬂakes with analytical results
from the literature. It is well known (particularly in the polymer physics community) that
the asymptotic departure from the Rayleigh limit at small sizes may be approximated
as:

This is the Guinier equation (Guinier 1939, Guinier et al 1955), and it applies to particles
of any shape, provided 2kr is small enough. Equation (7) is plotted alongside the

aggregates is quite good at small enough sizes, but diverges once 2kr > 0.5. We also

note that the sphere model predicts a form factor of zero (ie. no back scatter at all) at
3.5, and similar points with f = 0 at higher values of 2kr. This undulating form
2kr
(also found in the exact Mie solution) is a peculiarity of the spherical case, and is not
reproduced for our aggregates which do not possess the smooth, symmetrical shape of
the idealised dielectric sphere. The errors associated with the spherical approximation
are discussed in more detail in section 8.

Values of 2kr for typical Cirrus snowﬂake sizes (0.5 and 1.0mm maximum dimen-
sion) at representative radar frequencies (35 and 94 Ghz) are marked on ﬁgure 4, and
in all cases 2kr < 1. We investigate the consequences of this in the next section, where
we show that if the Guinier approximation holds, derivation of average particle size is
exceptionally straightforward and may be achieved through a simple analytical formula.
Since radar scattering is rather sensitive to the largest particles in the distribution
(even though there may be relatively few of them), we also consider the case of
snowﬂakes beyond the Guinier regime and ﬁt a curve to the complete form factor. We
then demonstrate how such a curve may be used to interpret radar data which is outside
the Guinier regime.

INTERPRETATION OF REFLECTIVITY DATA

In this section we employ the dynamical scaling property of the distribution, along
with the results from the previous section on the scattering from individual snowﬂakes,
in order to study the physical signiﬁcance of reﬂectivity measurements and to make use
of this understanding to infer the cloud’s microphysical properties (average snowﬂake
size, ice water content, etc).

The practical consequence of equation 11 is that given two simultaneous measure-
ments at different radar frequencies the average snowﬂake radius may be calculated
analytically through equation 11, provided that a) at least one of the radars is operating
at a wavelength sufﬁciently short that some of the snowﬂakes fall outside the Rayleigh
regime, and b) both radars have wavelengths long enough that the snowﬂakes fall pre-
dominantly inside the Guinier regime (2kr < 1). In previous dual wavelength studies
(eg. Matrosov 1998; Hogan et al 2000), the relationship between average particle size
and β has been calculated numerically for spheres and ellipsoids; here we have a simple
analytic result, which we expect to be applicable to typical snowﬂake sizes and radar
wavelengths.

(b) Larger aggregates

For large enough snowﬂakes relative to radar wavelength, the Guinier formula
breaks down, and in this section we identify the point where this occurs, and attempt
to ﬁt a curve to describe the scattering at large sizes. In order to achieve this, we rewrite

power law scaling between mass and radius, we expect F be a universal function of
2krav. Expressing η in this way makes it immediately obvious that only two quantities

dual wavelength measurements of ice clouds allow the second moment

to relate the moments of the size distribution that are of interest to the second moment

and may be measured from simulations or derived from experimental size spectra as per
Appendix B.

A parameter of signiﬁcant interest to meteorologists which some authors have
sought to derive from radar measurements is the effective radius re. This characterises
the average ratio of particle volume to projected area (Foot 1988):

where A is the particle projected area. For aggregates however, estimating re from the
dual wavelength derived average size is not possible. Since the mass is proportional to
r2, and likewise for the projected area (the aggregates considered here are fractals with
df = 2), the effective radius does not scale with the radius of gyration or maximum
dimension; its value is governed by the details of the pristine particles that compose
the aggregate snowﬂakes. Although there is likely to be some correlation between rav
and re from cloud to cloud, this simply reﬂects the fact that larger pristine particles
tend to yield larger aggregates. Essentially rav is a measure of the overall scale of the
aggregate, while re is a measure of the size of the pristine crystals. Trying to derive one
radius from the other is therefore not possible, and dual wavelength radar measurements
do not provide the means to estimate re.

7. APPLICATION TO CIRRUS CLOUD DATA SET

∼

In this section we apply the two methods for estimating rav to a dual wavelength
dataset from a real ice cloud. On the 22nd of June 1996, vertically pointing radar
measurements of a cirrus cloud over Chilbolton in the UK were made using 35 and
94Ghz radars. This data was presented in Hogan et al (2000), and the full experimental
details are given in that paper. Here we analyse the radar reﬂectivity time series from
one representative altitude (
6 km) where the data shows approximately the full range
of reﬂectivity values measured during the experiment. From these measurements we
have calculated the dual wavelength ratio β = Z35Ghz/Z94Ghz and this is plotted as a
function of time in ﬁgure 6. From this we have used ﬁrst the Guinier approximation
(small ﬂakes, as described in section 5a) and then our ﬁtted curve (section 5b) to infer
the average radius rav. These results are also plotted in ﬁgure 6 and it is immediately
apparent that there is very little to distinguish the Guinier-derived radius from the one
obtained using the full ﬁtted curve. The implication is that the snowﬂakes are small
enough that they lie within the Guinier regime, and since the average radius rav only
reaches around 0.3mm at most (
equivalent to 1mm maximum dimension), this means
2krav 6 1.2 for 94Ghz, and 2krav 6 0.4 for 35Ghz. Referring to section 5 these values
both fall roughly within the Guinier regime.

Black line shows the prediction of our ﬁtted curve (16); dashed line shows the Guinier approximation. Left hand
panel shows good agreement between the Guinier approximation and our ﬁtted curve at small sizes (r < 0.25);
the right hand panel shows the behaviour at larger sizes, where there is a marked divergence.

For the studied cirrus cloud at least, the Guinier formula is a good approximation.
We note however that even here the largest particles were on the edge of the regime
1); for thicker clouds containing larger aggregates this formula may not be
(2krav ≃
sufﬁcient, and the complete ﬁtted curve (16) should be used. Figure 7 shows a plot of
dual wavelength ratio as a function of average radius for 35- and 94-Ghz radars, as
predicted using both (16) and the Guinier approximation. It is apparent that the Guinier
0.3mm, beyond which point it rapidly breaks
formula holds up well to around rav ≃
down. It is useful to see however, that at least for parts of the cloud dominated by smaller
aggregates, the Guinier approximation does hold and that a simple analytic expression
provides an accurate estimate for rav. In both cases there is a need for the methods
to be validated through simultaneous aircraft measurement of particle mass and radius
distributions.

8. COMPARISON WITH SPHERICAL MODELS

Many authors have used a spherical approximation when estimating the back
scatter from snowﬂakes, modelling them as homogeneous mixtures of air and ice. The
motivation for this kind of approximation is that the scattering from a sphere with a
given diameter and dielectric constant may be calculated exactly using Mie theory. Here
we consider how closely the spherical model matches the results from our synthetic
aggregates.

≪

To mimic the results for the radar cross section by our simulated aggregates using
a sphere, we attempt to match up both the form factor f for the aggregates, and the m2
1. In ﬁgure 4 the form factor for a sphere was plotted alongside
dependance for 2kr
that for our simulated aggregates. There is good agreement up to 2kr
0.5, after which
the curves diverge somewhat. Thus for small aggregates at least, an equivalent sphere is
an accurate representation provided that the mass and radius of gyration are conserved.
We focus therefore on this regime, and consider the errors at larger sizes later. In order to
match up the scattering from our sphere with that of the aggregate it is intended to model,
we must ensure the radius of gyration of the sphere is the same as that of the aggregate.
For our simulated aggregates, the radius of gyration and maximum span are found to
scale linearly with r
0.3D, whereas a sphere of diameter Dsp has r = 0.39Dsp (see
Appendix A). To match these up then requires that the diameter of the equivalent sphere
be Dsp = 0.77D. This ensures that the sphere has the same radius of gyration as the
aggregate it is intended to represent, and hence the form factor shown in ﬁgure 4. A

Figure 8. Dual wavelength ratio β as a function of rav for 35- and 94-GHz radars as per ﬁgure 7. Black
line shows the prediction of our ﬁtted curve (16); dashed is the Guinier approximation. The grey lines show
measurements of β from a computer simulation in which a sphere was used to model the aggregates, where: (i)
the radius of gyration of the aggregate and the sphere used to model it were matched (light grey), and (ii) the
diameter of the sphere was chosen to be the maximum dimension of the aggregate (dark grey).

different choice of Dsp would result in the curve being squashed or stretched along the
2kr axis, and under/over-estimating the back scatter for 2kr < 0.5.

To estimate the error involved in this approach we have run computer simulations
where we calculate the dual wavelength ratio at 35- and 94-Ghz, modelling the scattering
from our aggregates as that of spheres. We have considered two cases: (i) where we
choose each sphere’s diameter so as to match the radius of gyration of the sphere with
that of the aggregate as discussed above, and (ii) where we choose the diameter of the
sphere to match the maximum dimension of the aggregate D (a model suggested by
some authors in the literature): the results of these simulations are shown in ﬁgure 8.
When the radii of gyration are matched, the agreement at small sizes is good, with only
around a 5% error in β relative to our ﬁtted curve at rav = 0.25mm. At larger sizes the
divergence is more apparent, and the sphere model overestimates β by around 25% at
rav = 1mm. Model (ii) performs rather less well: matching the diameter of the sphere to
the maximum dimension, the dual wavelength ratio is overestimated by around 20% at
rav = 0.25mm, and by more than 100% at rav = 1mm. We conclude that both methods
overestimate β for a given rav, but matching the radius of gyration of the sphere with
the aggregate results in much lower errors than matching their maximum dimension.

The second dependence that must be matched is the snowﬂake mass. Since the
snowﬂakes are not solid ice spheres, information about how much of the mixture is air
and how much is ice must be introduced by using an ‘average’ dielectric constant ǫav
weighted by the volume fraction of ice in the sphere fv = m/ π
6 (Dsp)3ρice. The most
common prescription for ǫav is the Maxwell-Garnett (1904) formula:

fv + ǫζfv

ǫav =

where the parameter ζ reﬂects the distribution of sizes and shapes of the ice ‘inclusions’
in the mixture (see Bohren and Huffman 1983 for more details). For spherical inclusions
ζ = 0.58. To check that introducing the aggregate density in this way yields the same
m2 dependance as per equation 5, we study the Rayleigh limit where the back scatter
cross section of our equivalent sphere is given by:

For solid ice spheres ǫav = ǫ, and since m = π

f = 1. For small volume fractions (the case most relevant to fractal aggregates, since
the overall density is proportional to rdf −3) we calculate the ratio of the back scatter

Other values of the parameter ζ are also in common usage - the assumption of needle
shape inclusions gives ζ = 0.65 and Meneghini and Liao (1996) have proposed a value
of ζ = 0.63. These alternate values of ζ essentially represent the polarisability of the
inclusions (which we interpret in the case of our aggregates as being the monomer
0, as
particles), and they predict a back scatter increased by as much as 25% as fv →
shown in ﬁgure 9. In section 4 it was commented that in the Rayleigh limit the scattering
from the individual monomers should be well represented by a sphere of the same
volume; if this is the case then the Rayleigh-Gans approximation ought to be accurate,
and these two values of ζ overestimate the scattering quite signiﬁcantly, particularly
at low volume fractions. This is perhaps a reﬂection of the fact that ‘effective medium’
theories such as the Maxwell-Garnett rule are intended for strong dielectrics at relatively
large volume fractions, neither of which is really the case for ice aggregates.

In summary, the spherical approximation matches the results for our aggregate
snowﬂakes provided that i) the diameter is chosen so as to match the radius of gyration
of the sphere to the snowﬂake it is intended to model, and ii) the parameter ζ is chosen so
as to give the correct m2 dependence in the Rayleigh limit. If the size of the aggregates
is not too close to the wavelength of the radar, then the error in β is only 5% or so; for
larger aggregates this may increase to 25% or more. It is important to note that a 5%
error in β may translate into a rather more signiﬁcant error in the derived parameters
such as rav and IWC.

9. CONCLUSIONS

The radar cross sections for our simulated snowﬂakes have been calculated using
the Rayleigh-Gans theory by treating the aggregates as being an assembly of inde-
pendant Rayleigh scatterers, and summing up the contributions from each element in
that assembly. In this theory, the scattering is proportional to the square of the particle
mass (as in the Rayleigh limit) and the form factor f , a dimensionless function which
describes the depedence on particle size and geometry. This function is universal (ie.
independent of the size and shape of the monomer particles), and f has been calculated
for our simulated aggregates.

This is (to the authors’ knowledge) the ﬁrst time that the scattering from realistic
aggregate snowﬂakes has been calclulated. It also appears to be the ﬁrst time the
Rayleigh-Gans theory has been employed to study radar scattering by ice particles,
with the exception of Matrosov (1992) who used it only as an approximation to the
exact Mie solution for a sphere. Ideally we would like to verify the results obtained in
this paper using the discrete dipole approximation which accounts for the interaction
between the scattering elements. However, this places heavy demands on computer
time and memory, since a large number of dipoles are needed to accurately model the
detailed structure of the aggregates, and calulations for many possible realisations and
orientations must be done in order to obtain good statistics. So far this has not been
achieved. Also, in order to test the accuracy of the theoretical results in sections four
and ﬁve, simultaneous radar and aircraft observations of ice clouds are needed.

The form factor for our simulated snowﬂakes was compared to analytical results for
f from the scattering literature, the most successful of which in describing the data was

Having calculated the scattering cross section of individual aggregates, these were
then integrated over the size distribution, and the results interpreted in terms of moments
of that distribution. The reﬂectivity is proportional to the second moment of the mass
m2. We have calculated
distribution
F as a function of the average radius rav, and ﬁtted a curve to our simulation data. The
application of our results to the inference of average snowﬂake size from radar data has
been investigated, and for snowﬂakes sufﬁciently small compared to the wavelength, the
Guinier approximation provides a very simple analytic expression for rav in terms of the
dual wavelength ratio β. At larger values of 2krav, the Guinier curve underestimates the
back scatter: we therefore ﬁtted a curve to our simulation data and used that curve to
provide a method to interpet the dual wavelength data.

Ideally, we would like to interpret the radar reﬂectances in terms of the ice water
content (total mass per unit volume) in the cloud. Since reﬂectivity is proportional
m2, some measure of average particle mass is required. We have shown that it
to
is possible to derive the average particle radius rav from dual wavelength radar data
and this may be converted to an average mass, provided that some measurement or
prescription for the prefactor a in the fractal scaling relation is available: a is a function
of the pristine crystal geometry and size.

P

Some authors have attempted to derive the effective radius (characterising the ratio
of particle volume to projected area) from radar measurements. However we have shown
that re depends only on the monomer particles (to which the radar is insensitive) and
not the overall size of the aggregate as characterised by rav. Direct inferral of re then is
not possible from dual wavelength radar data.

C. D. WESTBROOK et al.

Finally, the errors involved in modelling our simulated snowﬂakes as air/ice spheres
using the Maxwell-Garnett mixture theory were analysed. It was found that provided
some care was taken in constructing the equivalent sphere, and the radius is not too large,
the error is around 5% (rav = 0.25mm with 35/94Ghz radars), increasing to around 25%
at larger sizes (rav = 1mm). It is worth noting that such an error in the dual wavelength
ratio has the potential to translate into a much larger error in the derived parameters,
especially if β is close to unity.

In this paper we have used the radius of gyration r as the characteristic aggregate
length scale. It is deﬁned by splitting the particle into small volume elements, with
position r and mass dm. Then:

integrating over the particle volume. This radius is a natural length scale to use for the
scattering calculations because it is closely related to the integral for f in equation 6
at small kr, leading to the Guinier expansion f
1
3 (2kr)2. For our aggregates it
is linearly related to most other characteristic length scales, in particular the maximum
dimension D of the snowﬂakes (r

0.3D).

In the infrared and visible bandpass, optical propagation theory convention-
ally assumes that humidity does not contribute to the eﬀects of atmospheric
turbulence on optical beams. While this assumption may be reasonable for dry
locations, we demonstrate in this paper that there is an unequivocal eﬀect due
to the presence of humidity upon the strength of turbulence parameter, C 2
n,
from data collected in the Chesapeake Bay area over 100-m length horizontal
propagation paths. We describe and apply a novel technique, Hilbert Phase
Analysis, to the relative humidity, temperature and C 2
n data to show the

Introduction

It has been known for some time1 that the scintillation behaviour of point sources is a
measure of the optical seeing in the atmosphere. What has been less well understood is the
contribution of diﬀerent environmental variables to optical seeing.

Over the past decade, a great deal of study has been dedicated to clarifying this issue.
Comprehensive treatments of the theory of wave propagation in random media are given
in Tatarskii’s seminal works.2, 3 Some of the simplest models based on these complex works
are well known and available in the literature: Hufnagel–Valley,4 SLC-Day and SLC-Night.5
These models are commonly used to predict the strength of weak clear air turbulence’s re-
fractive index structure function, C 2
n. In all cases the underlying assumption is this: at optical

1

wavelengths the index of refraction of air depends solely upon pressure and temperature.6
As a consequence the temperature ﬂuctuations (dT ) are the dominant source of refractive
index variations (dn) such that the mean square refractive index ﬂuctuations are

< dT >2 .

This assumption is sensible in the driest of environments, but seems rather idealized in any
environment where there is a signiﬁcant amount of water vapour in the atmosphere.

Landbound horizontal path measurements show that during the daylight hours the weak
scintillation r´egime C 2
n trend is dominated by solar insolation, as is illustrated by the left hand
plot of Fig. 1. When the sun sets however, it is less clear as to the predominant contributing

2. Experiment and Correlogram Analysis

The C 2
n and associated weather variable data used in this study were collected over a number
of days during 2003 and 2004 at Chesapeake Beach in Maryland, USA, as indicated in Fig.

004) from Optical Scientiﬁc Inc, which serves as both a scintillometer and as an optical
anemometer for winds transverse to the beam paths. The separation between source and
receiver was just under 100-m, placing the system in the weak scintillation r´egime. The local
weather parameters were determined by a Davis Provantage Plus (DP+) weather station.
The LOA-004 had a sample rate of 10 seconds, while the DP+ was set at 5 minutes.

The LOA-004 instrument comprises of a single modulated infrared transmitter whose
output is detected by two single pixel detectors. For these data, the separation between
transmitter and receiver was 100-m. The path integrated C 2
n measurements are determined
by the LOA instrument by computation from the log–amplitude scintillation (Cχ(r)) of the

The C 2

n data was smoothed with a 60 point rolling average function. We deﬁne the morning
and night portions of a 24 hour period with respect to the measured solar irradiance function,
such that we exclude the eﬀect of solar insolation from the data in this study. Morning runs
from midnight until sunrise, while night runs from sunset until 23:59. As reported in Oh
et al.10, 11, 12 visual inspection of the time series data gives the impression that there is an
approximate inverse relationship between C 2
n and relative humidity. This can be appreciated
in a more quantitative manner by graphing one parameter against the other.

We chose data sets in which the temperature variations are no more than 16◦ F and the
pressure change is at most 15 mbars over the time intervals of interest. The data sections were
also selected to have no scattering eﬀects due to snow or rain, and the wind was northerly
(to within approximately ±20◦, inﬂowing from the bay to land). Given the aforementioned
conditions, from the data available only a subset provided complete time series in both
ambient weather variables and C 2
n. We were able to extract eight morning and evening runs,
spanning seven days between November 2003 and March 2004. As can be seen from Figs. (3
- 4), the C 2

n vs. humidity correlograms all evidence a negative gradient.

3. The Stationarity Problem

The unsophisticated use of the correlogram tool in Section 2 is a rapid, ﬁrst order method for
inferring the statistical inﬂuence of one measurable upon another. However it is unsatisfactory
as it does not reveal any detailed information, such as exactly when the humidity contribution
is important with respect to all other possible parameters (e.g. temperature) and to what
degree its contribution is inﬂuential. Cross covariance techniques are a possible second order
method13 for extending the analysis, but there are two major stumbling blocks. The ﬁrst
is the diﬃculty in interpreting the meaning of the covariance functions physically and the
second is the non–stationary nature of the data. In the latter case it is well known that
strict stationarity is a constraint that is impossible to satisfy on practical grounds, since no
detector can cover all possible points in phase space. This has motivated us to employ a
novel analysis technique to infer the relationship between C 2
n and climate parameters, which
we brieﬂy describe in the following section. We leave a more detailed study of the technique
to a separate paper.

where H[•] represents a Hilbert Transform. Ψ(t) is unique and an analytic signal. The Hilbert
Transform is a well known integral transform with a singular kernel (1/(π(t−s)), s also being
a time variable if t is time. It is also a Cauchy Principal integral, which we denote by P,
where the real axis singularity at t = s is taken along a positive semi-circular path. An
alternative way of writing Eq. (3) is

Ψ(t) = a(t) expiΦ(t) , whence

a(t) =

This de Moivre form of the analytic signal is similar to the Fourier amplitude and phase
expression. Note though that the Hilbert amplitude and phase are time dependent variables,
as opposed to the Fourier analysis where they are ﬁxed values per frequency.

3.B. Hilbert Phase Analysis

If one applies the Hilbert Transform directly to a time varying signal, there is a high proba-
bility that at least one of a number of paradoxes15 will be encountered, leading to unphysical
results, due to the presence of so–called “riding waves” which cause asymmetries in the
signal.

These paradoxes may be avoided by the application of the Empirical Mode Decompo-
sition16, 17 (EMD) method developed by Huang et al.18 From the application of the EMD
algorithm, we may extract Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) whose instantaneous frequen-
cies are well deﬁned. The instantaneous frequency ω(t) is given by

ω(t) =

dΦ(t)
dt

.

(5)

The application of the Hilbert Transform to the IMFs yields physically meaningful inter-
pretations of the oscillatory phenomena. This may be best appreciated if we consider the
signals in Hilbert phase space, as in Fig. (5). By na¨ively applying the Hilbert Transform to
a non–stationary time series (C 2
n measurements) we see that the trajectory of the analytic
signal’s vector is subject to many alterations in origin and phase angle. Unfortunately this
causes the instantaneous frequency to adopt both positive and negative values, rendering
the signal’s Hilbert transform physically uninterpretable. On the other hand, the Hilbert
Transform of the IMFs, one of which is shown on the right side of Fig. (5), ensures that
the analytic signal vector’s origin stays ﬁxed and no sudden changes in the direction of ω(t)
occur. When these conditions are satisﬁed, the instantaneous frequency remains positive and
physically meaningful.

4. Hilbert Phase Analysis

The Hilbert Phase Analysis (HPA) technique is based on the ideas mentioned in the previous
subsections. The IMFs determined through EMD from the input signal are the analytic signal
eigenfunctions of the EMD sifting operation and it is clear that a phase angle (Φ(t)), as well
as an amplitude (a(t)), can be determined from them.

The procedure for the HPA data analysis follows a three step protocol:

1. Decompose the relevant measured time series via EMD, obtaining their IMFs and trend

lines.

2. Apply the Hilbert Transform to the various IMF sets.

3. Examine the phase angles of the Hilbert Transformed IMFs to infer the dynamics of

the physical system.

4.A.

Interpretation of HPA

In this section we demonstrate that physical eﬀects of a non–linear, non–stationary, time
varying system can be studied via the sum of all IMF phases,

IM F Φ(t).

P

P

In Fig. (6) the

IM F Φ(t) is graphed with the solar radiation data superimposed for
example days. There is clearly a gradient change in the phase function at sunrise and sunset.
Also notable is the phase jump towards a lower gradient whenever the solar radiation function
exhibits a drop in amplitude; likewise the phase gradient increases with sudden increases in
the measured solar radiation. This is interpretable in the following manner: a reduction
in energy in the system leads to a lower instantaneous frequency, therefore we see a lower
gradient. An increase in energy results in a higher instantaneous frequency, so we see a higher
gradient. We conclude that overall physical features of a non–stationary time series can be
extracted by inspection of the sum of its Hilbert Phases.

a strong linearity over time in all cases.13 This occurs despite the variations in the indi-
vidual
ΦT ; we may infer from this observation that the relative humidity and
temperature are approximately inversely related during the time intervals of these data sets.
To better understand the dependence of ΦC upon humidity and temperature, we consider
the diﬀerence between observable phases, as shown in Figs. (8) to (15). The linear tendancy

The actual results prove contrary to that expectation. Instead what is seen is the inﬂuence
of diﬀerent factors competing over time, a fact that is deducible by comparison with the
∆CH = ΦC − ΦH and ∆CT = ΦC − ΦT graphs. In Table 1 we list the gradients of the linear
regression lines through the phase diﬀerence curves.

It is anticipated that the dominant climate parameter will be indicated by a smaller phase
diﬀerence magnitude. We reason this because if there is no change in phase diﬀerence between

Fig. 16. Plots of Hilbert Phase diﬀerences between C 2
n and solar radiation for
03/27/04 and 03/28/04. The solar radiation function is superimposed at an
arbitrary scale on each graph.

C 2
n and a climate variable then the two datasets must be phase locked. In other words,
the phase angle diﬀerence between C 2
n and the climate parameter is constant. If the mean
phase diﬀerence is zero then any variations about zero should indicate a synchronization.
Supporting empirical evidence is found upon studying cases wherein the solar insolation
inﬂuence upon the measured C 2
n is strong, as in Fig. (16). In those plots one can see that
the diﬀerence between the summed Hilbert Phase of C 2

ﬂattens out when the solar function is signiﬁcant.

Our original selection function attempted to limit the variations in ambient climate vari-
ables with the exception of humidity. So in general we expect the dominant climate variable
to be humidity for these datasets. This is true in most of the cases; however in the 11/03/03
and 04/03/04 (a.m. and p.m.) datasets it appears that the temperature is vying with hu-
midity for inﬂuence over the C 2

n parameter.

If we follow the assumptions of standard theory, the only major contributor should be the
local temperature variations. ∆CT has no near zero value, so temperature variation does not
dominate any of the cases. If we postulate that only humidity plays a rˆole in aﬀecting C 2
n
in these data, then we see this during the mornings of 11/10/03 and 03/28/04. It is also
noteworthy that the mornings of 11/04/03 and 11/09/03 show the mean of humidity and
temperature to be phase locked with C 2
n.

A possible explanation for 11/04/03 and 11/09/03 is that we are considering relative
humidity rather than absolute humidity. It is well known that the water vapour capacity of
air is a function of temperature, so the same amount of water vapour per unit volume of
air can give diﬀerent relative humidities at diﬀerent air temperatures. The initial selection
condition permitting no more than 16◦F in temperature diﬀerence is therefore too na¨ive to
account for this.

The HPA method is apparently able to show the proportional contribution to C 2

n of each
climate variable. Further study is necessary to show whether the individual contributions
are indeed related to each observable’s Hilbert phase gradient.

6. Conclusions

We have shown conclusively that humidity plays a signiﬁcant part in the optical measure
of C 2
n in a coastal environment. This suggests that standard dimensional analysis based
theory for describing the behaviour of optical turbulence is incomplete and unable to describe
turbulence in all but the driest locales. Furthermore we have explored a new technique,
Hilbert Phase Analysis, with which to study this physical phenomenon. We have found that
the HPA technique described here is very promising and is likely to provide much more
information about the changes to a physical system than traditional methods.

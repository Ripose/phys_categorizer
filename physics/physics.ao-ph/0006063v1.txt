Abstract: We report that the submerged microbubbles are an efﬁcient source
of diffuse radiance and may contribute to a rapid transition to the diffuse
asymptotic regime. In this asymptotic regime an average cosine is easily pre-
dictable and measurable.

Introduction

The vertical structure of light in the sea is important in marine bio-optics. Sunlight is the energy
source for the biological food chain, and the amount and spectrum of solar energy available at
a given depth must be known if accurate productivity calculations are to be made. The vertical
structure of the diffuse attenuation coefﬁcient in the near surface regime is important in under-
standing optical remote sensing. The behavior of the light ﬁeld in the sea is described by the
equation of radiative transfer, which relates the light ﬁeld to the inherent optical properties of
water and its constituents [1]. Once this equation is solved certain moments of the light ﬁeld can
be derived and compared with measurements. Of particular interest is the average cosine of irra-
diance at depth z which is deﬁned by ¯µ(z) = E(z)/E0(z), where E0(z) is the scalar irradiance
and E(z) is the net (vector) irradiance, both with units Wm−2. The downwelling average co-
sine is ¯µd(z) = Ed/E0, where Ed is the downwelling irradiance. The average cosine, which can
vary between -1 and 1, gives directional information about the radiance distribution. The aver-
age cosine is also related to the diffuse attenuation coefﬁcient K(z) = −1/E(z)dE(z)/dz. In-
tegration of the radiative transfer equation over all directions leads to dE(z)/dz = −a(z)E0(z)
so that ¯µ(z) = a(z)/K(z), which is known as Gershun’s equation. We can now measure a(z)
and K(z) routinely, so that it is possible to verify predictions of the vertical distribution of ¯µ on
the basis of observations. A number of models of the vertical structure of the average cosine of
the light ﬁeld have been presented [1-4] but they have all been limited to homogeneous media
with a ﬂat surface. On the other hand, using the data from the Gulf of California and the East
Coast shelf one of us (JRVZ, unpublished) concluded that the average cosine models do not ﬁt
the determination of ¯µ(z) from K(z) and a(z). It is speculated that this departure from theory
is due to vertical inhomogeneities in the inherent optical properties (IOPs) and the possibility
that the light ﬁeld in the surface layer of the ocean may be more diffuse than theoretical models
assume. This diffuse light ﬁeld may be due to haze and clouds in the atmosphere, relatively
low solar zenith angles, surface waves, and microbubbles in the surface layer. A combination of
these factors contributes to the light ﬁeld being quite diffuse throughout the water column. In
this study we demonstrate the capacity of air bubbles to be an efﬁcient scatterer.

2 Results

There is limited knowledge [5-7] about the radiative transfer properties of bubble clouds, their
inherent optical properties, and their global climatology. Recently, we reported [8] on the inﬂu-
ence of submerged bubble clouds within the water on the remote sensing reﬂectance. Individual
bubble clouds persist for several minutes and are generated by breaking waves. There is evi-
dence that at high wind speeds, separate bubble clouds near the surface coalesce, producing a
stratus layer [9,10]. The majority of bubbles injected into the surface layers of natural waters are
unstable, either dissolving due to enhanced surface tension and hydrostatic pressures or rising to
the air-water interface where they break [11]. However, bubbles with long residence times, i.e.
stable microbubbles have been observed [12-14]. One of the stabilization mechanisms [15,11]
assumes that the surfactant material is a natural degradation product of chlorophyll, present in
photosynthesizing algae.

We consider three simple situations: (1) “inﬁnitely” deep homogeneous ocean composed
of CDOM, water, and particulates; (2) “inﬁnitely” deep homogeneous ocean composed of the
same CDOM, water, and particulates but also with bubbles; (3) two meter layer of bubbles and

replenished by wave activity (breaking waves at the surface) leading eventually to semi-
homogeneous layer.

“background” CDOM, water, and particulates. In Fig. 1 the two-layer case is presented. (based
on [10]).

The background water, CDOM, and particulates are characterized by absorption and scat-
tering coefﬁcients a = 0.1801m−1 and b = 1.2525m−1 (thus we include water a and b). It
corresponds to a chlorophyll concentration of 10mgm−3 at a wavelength λ = 550nm. The
particulate phase function is that of Petzold for turbid water [7]. The phase function for bubbles
was calculated by averaging from size parameter x = 10 − 350, where x = 2πr/λ, r is radius.
The size distribution follows a r−4 law. A phase function was derived using the exact method
for spheres and we assume a refractive index n = 3/4. The scattering coefﬁcient for bubbles
is assumed to be bbubble = 0.6181m−1. In our recent paper [8] we discuss in detail the clima-
tology of bubble layer depth, vertical distribution, and dependence of depth on the wind speed.
Assumptions made here are typical for 10m/s winds in bubble-stratus regime. The radiative
transfer calculations were performed using the Monte-Carlo technique [16]. The main results
of this note are presented in Figs. 2-3. Fig. 2 shows the average cosine for the downwelling
radiation for the three cases discussed above. In this ﬁgure “circles” are for the two-layer sys-
tem. At ﬁrst there a is rapid decrease in the value of the average cosine as initially collimated
photons are efﬁciently scattered. After exiting the “bubble” layer the light is already diffuse and
only a small adjustment is needed to attain an asymptotic regime for the “no bubbles” situation.
This double-exponential transition mechanism seems to be particularly efﬁcient in establish-
ing the near-surface diffuse light ﬁeld. Clearly, the depth of the bubble layer and the inherent
optical properties will further determine this efﬁciency. Fig 3 shows ¯µ(z), which contains con-
tribution from the upwelling radiation as well. The upwelling radiance ﬁeld adjusts gradually
when photons interact with the “bubble” layer. There is preferential loss of photons traveling
in the horizontal direction. This leads to more collimated light and increased average cosine
close to the surface. In reference [8] we discuss in more detail the climatology of bubble clouds,
which strongly depends on wind speed. The importance of bubbles on an asymptotic light ﬁeld
depends on wind speed, wind gustiness, and microphysical properties of bubbles. Incoming
ﬁeld projects and laboratory studies should give a clearer answer on the inﬂuence of bubbles
on marine light ﬁelds. In summary we show that the submerged microbubbles are an efﬁcient
source of diffuse radiance and, if present, contribute to rapid transition to the diffuse asymptotic
regime.

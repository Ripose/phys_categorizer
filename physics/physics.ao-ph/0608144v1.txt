Vertically pointing Doppler radar has been used to study the evolution of

ice particles as they sediment through a cirrus cloud. The measured Doppler

fall speeds, together with radar-derived estimates for the altitude of cloud

top, are used to estimate a characteristic fall time tc for the ‘average’ ice par-

ticle. The change in radar reﬂectivity Z is studied as a function of tc, and

is found to increase exponentially with fall time. We use the idea of dynam-

ically scaling particle size distributions to show that this behaviour implies

exponential growth of the average particle size, and argue that this expo-

nential growth is a signature of ice crystal aggregation.

The growth of ice crystals and aggregate snowﬂakes in clouds is a key process both for

the development of precipitation (Jiusto and Weickmann 1973), and in terms of the eﬀect

such clouds have on climate (Houghton 2001). In this work, we use radar observations of

deep cirrus to study the growth of ice particles as they sediment through the cloud.

Vertically-pointing measurements of radar reﬂectivity Z and Doppler velocity vd were

made using the 35 GHz (8.6 mm) ‘Copernicus’ radar at the Chilbolton observatory in

southern England. At this wavelength, the overwhelming majority of cirrus-sized particles

are within the Rayleigh regime where the backscattered intensity is proportional to the

square of particle mass m:

Z =

ice

∞

×

0
Z

n(m)m2dm,

(1)

where ρice is the density of solid ice and n(m)dm is the number density of particles with

mass between m and m + dm. The dielectric factor Kice contains the information about

the shape and dielectric strength of the particles: for spherical ice particles Kice = ǫ−1

ǫ+2

and the permittivity of ice ǫ at millimetre wavelengths is approximately 3.15 (Jiang and

Wu 2004). The Rayleigh scattering approximation at 35 GHz is accurate to within 10%

for particles with a maximum dimension of 1 mm or less (Westbrook et al 2006).

The Doppler velocity is vd = vt + vair, where vt is the m2-weighted average terminal

velocity of the particles and vair is the vertical air motion. We use these measurements to

estimate a characteristic particle fall time tc, which we deﬁne as the time for which the

‘average’ particle (with terminal velocity vt) has been falling. Taking the cloud top height

htop to be the altitude at which there is no longer a detectable radar return, we calculate

Given this new measure, we are in a position to investigate the evolution of the ice

particles, by studying the variation of reﬂectivity Z with increasing fall time tc. The

advantage of this method, as opposed to simply studying Z as a function of height, is

that tc represents the physical time for which the average ice particle has been falling for

to reach a given height h, allowing us to relate our results to theoretical models of ice

particle growth. Note that we have implicitly assumed that the cloud is in a steady state,

such that the properties of the ice particles at height h do not change signiﬁcantly over

the length of time it takes a particle to fall from cloud top to cloud base (which is between

45 minutes and 2 hours for the cases shown here). We therefore apply our technique only

to non-precipitating, well developed ice clouds where there is there is low wind shear.

Our case study is a cirrus cloud observed over Chilbolton on the 13th of May 2004.

Measurements of reﬂectivity and Doppler velocity were made and the time series of these

observations is shown in ﬁgure 1. The radar gate length is 60 m (Illingworth et al 2006).

The values of Z and vd are averages over periods of 30 seconds: in ﬁgure 1c we also show

the standard deviation σv of the 1-s average Doppler velocity over each 30-s period, to

indicate the small-scale variability in vd. This measure allows the level of turbulence in

the cloud to be assessed (Bouniol et al 2003).

Figure 2 shows four representative vertical proﬁles sampled from diﬀerent portions of

the cloud, indicated by the dashed lines on ﬁgure 1. The highest detectable cloud pixel

(corresponding to ≃ −15 dBZ) from the proﬁle is taken as a measure of cloud top. The

fall time at each height bin is calculated from the Doppler velocity proﬁle as per equation

2, and we plot Z as a function of tc. From ﬁgure 2 we see that reﬂectivity increases

rapidly with fall time (note the logarithmic dBZ units), which we interpret as rapid growth

of the ice particles. This could potentially be occurring through a number of possible

mechanisms: deposition of water vapour; aggregation via diﬀerential sedimentation of

the ice particles; or collisions with supercooled drops (riming).

In section 4 we show

that it is likely that aggregation is the dominant growth mechanism. The increase in Z

appears to be exponential to a good approximation, and occurs for between 2500 and 5000

seconds in the proﬁles shown here. The slopes on the log scale vary between approximately

2.5 × 10−3 dBZ s−1 and 5 × 10−3 dBZ s−1, presumably depending on how much ice is being

produced at cloud top. After this time there is a sharp turn over in the Z(tc) curves,

D R A F T

D R A F T

X - 6

and we attribute this to evaporation of the particles near cloud base. Such evaporation

often results in increased air turbulence for which the particles themselves act as tracers,

resulting in large variability in the Doppler velocity, and our observations (ﬁgures 1 and

2) show a sudden increase in σv at approximately the same time as the turn over in Z(tc)

in two of the proﬁles shown (08:06 and 08:30 UTC), supporting this hypothesis. In the

other two cases the lower ice water content meant that the latent cooling was not strong

enough to trigger convective overturning and turbulence.

Exponential growth has also been observed in a number of other cloud data sets, and

four more example proﬁles from well developed non-precipitating ice clouds during April

and May 2004 are shown in ﬁgure 3. This is an interesting feature of the data, and a

robust one in the face of errors in htop:

if Z(tc) is exponential, then even if we have

underestimated the cloud top somewhat (on account of the limited sensitivity of the

radar), this will merely correspond to an oﬀset in the fall time, and the exponential shape

of Z(tc) is still preserved.

3. Scaling analysis

Here we show how the reﬂectivity Z is related to the average particle size. Scaling

or ‘normalised’ forms for the size distributions of both liquid and ice particles have been

proposed in a number of recent articles (rain: Testud et al 2001, Illingworth and Blackman

2002, Lee et al 2005; ice: Field and Heymsﬁeld 2003, Westbrook et al 2004a,b, Delano¨e

et al 2005). The essence of these rescaling schemes is that the underlying shape of the

distribution φ(m/hmi) is the same throughout the vertical proﬁle, but is rescaled as a

function of the (increasing) average particle mass hmi as the particles grow:

n(m) = IWC × hmi−2φ (m/hmi) .

(3)

where we have normalised by the ice water content IWC. The universal function φ is

dimensionless. Equation 3 indicates that a single average particle mass hmi is suﬃcient to

characterise the evolution of the particle size distribution, and this is key to our analysis.

An example of such a distribution is that assumed in the UK Met Oﬃce’s Uniﬁed Model

(Wilson and Ballard 1999). Mass m and diameter D are assumed to be in a power law

relationship m = a′Db, with an exponential distribution for particle diameter:

n′(D) = N0 exp(−3.67D/D0)

where D0 is the median volumetric diameter and n′(D) = n(m)dm/dD. A single bulk

prognostic variable is used for the ice particle mixing ratio and N0 is parameterised to

decrease with increasing temperature to mimic particle growth. Within the framework

(3) above, this distribution corresponds to:

where x = m/hmi, and hmi = a′Db
0.

Irrespective of what form is assumed for φ(x), a scaling relationship between diﬀerent

moments of the distribution may be found. The kth moment of the mass distribution is

103

At this point we make a crucial assumption: that there is some moment of the distribution

104

k which is approximately constant through the vertical proﬁle. In the case where aggrega-

105

tion is the dominant growth mechanism with a ﬁxed production of ice mass at cloud top,

106

one would expect the mass ﬂux density of ice

∞
0 n(m)mv(m)dm to be constant. Mitchell
R

107

(1996) indicated that a power law for ice particle fall speeds v is a good approximation:

108

v(m) ∝ mc, so for pure aggregation k = 1 + c. Similarly, where diﬀusional growth or

109

riming is dominant, the total number ﬂux of particles would be roughly constant and

110

k = c would be the conserved moment.

If this assumption holds then the bracketted

111

expression (. . .) in equation 8 is ﬁxed through the vertical proﬁle, and Z ∝ hmi2−k. Given

our observations of exponential Z(tc) and the predicted power law between Z and hmi

4. A Signature of Aggregation?

114

We oﬀer a possible explaination for the exponential growth of ice particles described

115

above. Aircraft observations have indicated that aggregation is often the dominant growth

116

mechanism for particles larger than a few hundred microns in cirrus clouds (Field and

117

Heymsﬁeld 2003), and it is these large particles which dominate the radar reﬂectivity.

Recently, Westbrook et al (2004a,b) modelled ice particle aggregation by considering a

rate of close approach between pairs of ice particles with masses m and m′:

K =

(Dmax + D′

max)2 |v − v′| ,

π
4

120

where v and Dmax are the associated fall speed and maximum dimension. Particles were

121

picked according to the rate above, and traced along possible trajectories to accurately

122

sample the collision geometries of the non-spherical ice particles. The fall speeds were

123

prescribed in the vein of Mitchell (1996):

(9)

(10)

v ∝

mα
Dmax

,

124

where the adjustable parameter α determines the drag regime (inertial ﬂow α = 1

2; viscous

125

ﬂow α = 1). One of the key results from these simulations was that the aggregates pro-

126

duced by the model had a power law relationship between mass and maximum dimension

m ∝ Db

max, where the exponent is determined purely by the drag regime: b = 1/(1 − α)

for α < 2

3. This relation is also backed up by a theoretical argument based on a feedback

129

between the aggregate geometry and collision rate (Westbrook et al 2004b). For large

130

snowﬂakes, α → 1

2 and b → 2, in good agreement with aircraft observations (eg. b = 1.9,

131

Brown and Francis 1995; b = 2.04, Heymsﬁeld et al 2002).

132

In this study we are interested in the average ice particle growth rate, which is deter-

133

mined through the scaling of the collision kernel (9). Given the above relationship between

134

a and b, and equations 9 and 10, we see that if one doubles the masses of the aggregating

135

particles m, m′:

K(2m, 2m′) = 2λK(m, m′),

(11)

136

where λ = α + 1/b = 1. This parameter controls the scaling of the particle growth rates

137

and as such controls the growth of the average particle mass.

138

Van Dongen and Ernst (1985) have shown that the coagulation equation (Pruppacher

139

and Klett 1997) has solutions with the same scaling form as (3), and predicts that the

140

average particle mass grows according to the diﬀerential equation:

141

where w is a constant. Given our prediction of λ = 1 from the aggregation model we see

142

immediately that:

dhmi
dtc

= whmiλ,

hmi ∝ exp(wtc),

(12)

(13)

143

i.e. the prediction from aggregation theory is that average particle mass grows exponen-

144

tially with fall time, in agreement with our observations. We note that the Van Dongen

145

and Ernst analysis is for cases where total mass is conserved: however given the observed

146

scaling behaviour (3) and a power law relationship between mass and fall speed, the case

147

where mass ﬂux density is conserved should yield the same result.

148

149

The growth of particles by diﬀusion of water vapour may also be described by a similar

equation to (12). However in that case λ = 1/b and w = 4πC0a−1/b × s/(A + B), where

D R A F T

D R A F T

X - 12

WESTBROOK ET AL.: ICE PARTICLE EVOLUTION

150

C0 is the ‘capacitance’ per unit diameter, s is the supersaturation with respect to ice,

151

and the terms A and B depend on temperature T and pressure P (Pruppacher and Klett

152

1997). For a given set of conditions (s, T, P ), the growth by deposition would be expected

153

to increase slower with particle size than for aggregation, taking a power law form hmi ∝

154

tb/(b−1)
c

. In real clouds these conditions do not stay constant, and there is a correlation

155

between increasing particle size and increased temperature and supersaturation, which

156

could lead to a faster growth rate. However, it would take a considerable conspiracy

157

between these variables to obtain a constant exponential growth throughout such an

158

extensive region of the cloud as is observed in our radar data. It also seems extremely

159

unlikely that this correlation would be the same for all ﬁve cirrus cases shown in ﬁgures

160

2 and 3. We note that there is a region of sub-exponential growth close to cloud top

161

(small tc) in some of the proﬁles in ﬁgure 3: we suggest that it is in this region, where the

162

particles are small and falling slowly, that diﬀusional growth dominates.

163

It seems very unlikely that riming dominated the ice particle growth. A large number of

164

supercooled drops throughout the depth of the cloud would be required for this to be the

165

case, and the Met Oﬃce mesoscale model (Wilson and Ballard 1999) indicates that for

166

167

our case study the temperature at cloud top was approximately −40◦C, while cloud base

was approximately −15◦C. At these cold temperatures it is very unlikely that supercooled

168

drops would persist on long enough time scales and in large enough quantities to dominate

169

the growth over the 2.5 km or so for which we have observed Z(tc) to increase exponen-

170

tially. We therefore discount deposition and riming, and assert that our observations are

an indicator that aggregation is the dominant growth mechanism for the ice particles in

172

these clouds.

5. Discussion

173

Doppler radar measurements of cirrus cloud were used to study the evolution of the ice

174

particles sedimenting through it. The results indicate that in the cases studied the average

175

ice particle mass grows exponentially with fall time, in agreement with the theoretical

176

expectation for aggregation, and we believe that this is evidence that aggregation of ice

177

crystals is the dominant growth mechanism for large particles in deep, well developed ice

178

clouds.

179

180

185

186

The constant w described in the aggregation theory above is directly related to the mass

ﬂux density, so measurements of the dBZ-tc slope may allow the derivation of this quantity,

181

and the data could be combined with Doppler velocity measurements to estimate the ice

182

water content. However, the sticking eﬃcency of the ice particles (which we assume to be

183

constant with particle size) is also a factor in w, and this is a parameter for which there

184

are few reliable experimental estimates. For warmer, ‘stickier’ ice crystals at temperatures

above −5◦C this may be more feasible since the sticking eﬃciency should be close to unity.

In this paper we have assumed the ice particles fall vertically. In reality there is likely

187

to be some horizontal shear, and indeed there are noticeable fall streaks in ﬁgure 1. It

188

might be valuable to try and identify fall streaks in the cloud data and apply the analysis

189

along such a streak to see if there is any diﬀerence in the results. In the cases shown here,

190

adjacent proﬁles of Z(tc) are fairly similar over tens of minutes of data, and so we do not

191

anticipate that the results will be dramatically diﬀerent.

192

Possible directions for future work are to make dual-wavelength radar measurements of

193

cirrus in order to obtain a more direct estimate of particle size (Westbrook et al 2006).

194

This would help to pin down the dominant growth mechanism, since it would allow us

195

to study moments of the distribution other than Z, and analyse whether k = 1 + c

196

(aggregation) or k = c (deposition, riming) is the moment conserved through the cloud.

197

Also, further studies of other cirrus cases, both at Chilbolton and other radar sites, could

198

be of interest to see how widespread the observed exponential trend is.

Figure 1. Radar time series of a cirrus cloud over Chilbolton on the 13th May 2004. Panels

(a) and (b) show the reﬂectivity Z and Doppler velocity vd respectively: both are averages over

30 s of data. Panel (c) shows the standard deviation σv of the 1-s average Doppler velocity for

each 30-s period, indicating the variability in vd.

Figure 2. Four ‘snapshot’ vertical proﬁles from the cirrus case, taken at 07:09, 07:38, 08:06,

and 08:30 UTC. Top row is reﬂectivity in dBZ as a function of characteristic fall time (points).

The solid line is intended to guide the eye, and indicates an exponential growth in Z with tc.

Bottom row is σv as a function of tc, which we use as an indicator of particle evaporation near

cloud base.

Snapshot vertical proﬁles of reﬂectivity from a sample of four more cirrus cases

measured over Chilbolton during April and May 2004. Exact times and dates are indicated

on the individual panels. All show an exponential growth of reﬂectivity with fall time over a

signiﬁcant portion of the cloud vertical proﬁle.

Abstract

In this short review it is suggested that the relationship between
third- and fourth-order moments of turbulence in the atmospheric
boundary layer depends on stability. This can explain some diﬀerences
among datasets, and provides a key point for modelling improvement.

1 Introduction

Data on the third- and fourth-order moments of turbulent velocities in bound-
ary layers have been collected for many years, not only in the atmospheric
boundary layer (ABL), where their evaluation is somewhat diﬃcult (Lenschow et al.,
1994), but also in laboratory experiments, where the relationship between
odd-order moments and their next even-order was studied by Durst et al.
(1987), for instance.

Some recent papers (Ferrero and Racca, 2004; Cheng et al., submitted)
discuss the role of high order moments in parameterisations of the ABL,
often referred to as non-local models in that space derivatives of high order
moments are used to model lower orders.

1

The role of third order moments has long been recognised, at least in
the Convective Boundary Layer (CBL), as connected to non-local trans-
port properties (Wyngaard and Weil, 1991). As regards the fourth-order
moments, in the lack of any further information, the Millionchikov hypothe-
sis (Monin and Yaglom, 1971, p. 241) is usually invoked. This means that for
vanishing skewness that tends to zero, the normalised fourth order moments
(kurtosis) tend to their Gaussian values.

The question is whether the available data support this hypothesis, to

what extent and under which conditions.

2 Review of data and parameterisations

In the study of high-order moments, particular interest is devoted to the nor-
malised moments, i.e., skewness (S) and kurtosis (K) and relationships be-
tween them. Maurizi and Tampieri (1999), and subsequently Tampieri et al.
(2000), collected and analysed data from literature on horizontal and vertical
velocity skewness and kurtosis, considering a variety of turbulence genera-
tion mechanisms. Furthermore, recent papers focus attention in particu-
lar on the CBL: new measurements from aircraft (Gryanik and Hartman,
2002, GH hereafter) and with remote sensing acoustic techniques (SODAR)
(Alberghi et al., 2002, AMT hereafter) have been presented.

Diﬀerent simple parameterisations were proposed for the S-K relation-
ship. Tampieri et al. (2000), ﬁrst, and subsequently Maurizi and Lorenzani
(2001), proposed a parameterisation based on the observation that a statis-
tical limit exists in the S-K space (Kendall and Stuart, 1977), namely

K ≥ Klim = S2 + 1 .

(1)

This limit shapes the structure of the S-K. Thus, the pair (S, ˜K) with
˜K = K(S2 + 1)−1 can be taken as the natural coordinate system for the
S-K space. The simplest model (zero order) based on this observation can
be built assuming a constant ˜K and, therefore,
K = α0(S2 + 1) .

(2)

Fitting Equation (2) to data, Tampieri et al. (2000) found, for the ver-
tical velocity component, α0 = 3.3 for shear dominated boundary layers
(see Figure 1) and α0 = 2.5 in the CBL (AMT), adding new data to the
Tampieri et al. (2000) dataset, conﬁrmed the CBL result, giving α0 = 2.4.

GH found that a mass-ﬂux assumption for the CBL exactly results in
K = Klim (see Equation (1)) as a relationship between S and K. In fact,
it is known that this relationship only holds for two-value processes. They
used, as a generalisation, the form

K = α0(βS2 + 1) .

It is worth noting that Lewis et al. (1997) proposed a relationship of the same
form for concentration data, based on the ideas expressed by Chatwin and Sullivan
(1990). It can be observed that, for |S| < 1, Equation (3) is consistent with
a second order model in the (S, ˜K) space, namely

˜K = α0 + α1S + α2S2 ,

(3)

(4)

with α1 = 0 and α2 = α0(β − 1). Because the dataset of GH dataset shows
strictly leptokurtic cases (see also Cheng et al., submitted), they selected
α0 = 3, α1 = 0 and α2 = −2 in Equation (4), and thus assumed Gaussianity
for symmetric distributions.

This assumption is not in agreement with the AMT dataset, which shows
the presence of a great deal of data below K = 3. However the data in GH
refer to a particular case (cold air outbreak over the ocean) and fall within
the area covered by the AMT dataset, which collects measurements from
presumably diﬀerent environmental conditions.

The question remains as to whether this subset is simply incomplete with
respect to a full convective behaviour, or whether it reﬂects the fact that
the production mechanism determines the S-K relationship. In fact, while
the presented data are nominally taken in convective conditions, a concur-
rence of diﬀerent production mechanisms (shear and buoyancy) is actually
expected. For instance, the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory states that
for z ≪ |L| shear dominates over buoyancy, and it is presumable that data
taken at diﬀerent z/L present a diﬀerent balance between the two mecha-
nisms. Furthermore, the properties of measurements taken across the CBL
depth as a whole could depend on |L|/zi, which gives a measure of the frac-
tion of CBL where buoyancy cannot be considered as the only production
mechanism.

The two values α0 = 2.4 to α0 = 3.3 in Equation (2) suggest that the
Gaussian case (K → 3 as S → 0) may occur for the vertical turbulent velocity
as a transition between the shear and convective production mechanisms (for
instance, in the CBL at z < LMO).

This observation can be expressed by letting αi be a function of, at least,

the Richardson number Ri, thus re-writing Equation (2) as

K = α0(Ri)(S2 + 1)

(5)

with the constraint α0(Ri) > 1. It can be argued that α0 increases as z/LM O
increases from negative values to zero, consistently with Anfossi et al. (1997,
their Table 1).

3 More on stability eﬀects

It would be interesting to investigate this issue further if certain details on
the measurements were available. In order to overcome the unavailability of
such information, we consider a ﬂow over a simple obstacle, and use the anal-
ogy between buoyancy and streamline curvature (see, e.g., Bradshaw, 1969;
Baskaran et al., 1991) to investigate on the role of stability in determining
the character of the S-K relationship.

In a neutral turbulent ﬂow with streamline curvature, such as a ﬂow over
a hill, it is possible to deﬁne a curvature Richardson number RiC (Wyngaard,
1967) as

2U
R

RiC =

(6)

∂U
∂z
where U is the mean velocity module and R is the streamline curvature ra-
dius. Positive RiC corresponds to a dumping term in the turbulent energy
budget (e.g., on the hill top) expressed in streamline coordinates, while neg-
ative RiC represents an unstable contribution, e.g., near the hill base.

An experiment carried out in the Enﬂo “A” wind tunnel focused attention
on third- and fourth-order turbulence statistics . A turbulent boundary layer
was generated upstream of a sinusoidal, two-dimensional hill with aspect
ratio H/L = 5, where H is the obstacle height and L is half the total width.
Turbulence was measured with a hot-wire anemometer at 7 diﬀerent positions
streamwise, at 20 vertical levels. Measurements were recorded for times long
enough to produce reliable statistics up to the fourth order.

Figure 2 shows data of S and K for three proﬁles measured far upstream,
on the hill top and on the lee side at the hill foot. Those regions correspond
to RiC = 0, RiC > 0 and RiC < 0, respectively. Apart from the speciﬁc
structure revealed by the measurements in the unstable case for S in the
range 0.2–0.4, the form of the S-K relationship is similar for the three cases
and exhibits a minimum value.

6

We use this minimum as a rough indicator of the diﬀerent features of
the S-K relationship. This seems a reasonable parameter in that it could
discriminate data reported by GH from other data in the AMT dataset.

The minimum measured values of K are reported in Table 1 for three

diﬀerent cases of RiC estimated from a similar ﬂow (Maurizi et al., 1997).

Although measured proﬁles are largely inﬂuenced by the speciﬁc dynamics
of ﬂow over the obstacle and, in particular, by non local equilibrium in the
lee side, results are in qualitative agreement with the proposed dependence
of expansion coeﬃcients on stability (Equation (5)).

4 Conclusions

The S-K relationship is modelled by an expansion in an appropriate space
and some parameterisations in literature have been reduced to this scheme.
In this frame, comparing data for shear- and convective-dominated bound-
ary layers, it is found that model constants should depend on stability. In
particular, the Gaussian case can occur in intermediate situations between
the purely shear- and purely convective-dominated boundary layer.

Furthermore, an examination of the diﬀerences between two datasets for
the convective case suggests that that there could be a variety of behaviours
for diﬀerent balances between shear and buoyancy production.

As an example, some data measured in a wind tunnel experiment have
shown the possibility that the suggested dependence can be conﬁrmed. It is
worth pointing out that this dataset if far from exhaustive with respect to
the problem studied and it has been used merely as a indicator.

Further measurements of high-order moments of wind velocity in really
diﬀerent stability conditions are required in order to provide a more quanti-
tative response to the problem.

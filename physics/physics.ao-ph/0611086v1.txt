An objective change point analysis of landfalling historical
Atlantic hurricane numbers

Abstract

In previous work we have analysed the Atlantic basin hurricane number time-series to identify
decadal time-scale change points. We now repeat the analysis but for US landfalling hurricanes. The
results are very diﬀerent.

1 Introduction

In previous work (Jewson and Penzer, 2006) we have attempted to identify change points in the Atlantic
hurricane number time-series. We used a brute-force search through all possibilities to ﬁnd the change
points deﬁned by the global minimum in an out-of-sample mean squared error (MSE) cost function.
When we allowed gaps between change points as short as 2 years we were unable to ﬁnd the global
minimum because of the vast number of possible combinations of change points relative to currently
available computer power. However, when we increased the minimum gap between change points to 10
years we were able to ﬁnd the global minimum of the cost function. This global minimum corresponded
to 4 change points, occurring in 1931/1932, 1947/1948, 1969/1970 and 1994/1995. We also applied the
method to intense storms only, and found change-points in the years 1914/1915, 1947/1948, 1964/1965
and 1994/1995. The most recent two change-points we identify in the intense series correspond exactly
with the most recent two change-points identiﬁed in the earlier work of Elsner et al. (2000, 2004), using
a very diﬀerent detection algorithm.
We now repeat our change-point analysis for US landfalling hurricanes only. This is a much more diﬃcult
time series to work with, since the number of landfalling hurricanes is much lower than the total number
of Atlantic hurricanes, and there are many years with no landfalling hurricanes at all. We can thus
anticipate that it might be more diﬃcult to identify change points in this time-series. Elsner et al. (2004)
has previously analysed the same time series using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. In section 5
we compare our results with those from this earlier study.

2 Methods

Our method is the same as that used in Jewson and Penzer (2006), except that we now consider US
landfalling hurricane numbers rather than basin hurricane numbers. We also only use a 10 year minimum
gap between change points, whereas in Jewson and Penzer (2006) we performed a preliminary study using
a 2 year minimum gap.
We create our landfalling hurricane number time series directly from the current version of the HURDAT
database (Jarvinen et al., 1984), and deﬁne a landfalling hurricane as one which is a hurricane at the point
of landfall. We exclude hurricanes that weaken to non-hurricane status before landfall. The resulting
time series of hurricane numbers is shown in ﬁgure 1.

3 Results

Tables 1, 2 and 3 show the change points detected in the landfalling hurricane number time-series, the
out-of-sample RMSE scores for these change points, and the number of combinations tested to ﬁnd them,

respectively. Starting with the RMSE scores in table 2, we see a big diﬀerence between these results
and the results in Jewson and Penzer (2006). In that study, the RMSE reduced monotonically as we
increased the number of levels, down to a minimum at 5 levels, after which it started to increase again.
The minimum RMSE achieved was highly statistically signiﬁcant i.e. it is very unlikely that it could have
occurred unless the hurricane number time series has real temporal structure. In the landfalling case,
however, there is no clear monotonic decrease. In fact the best two level model is slightly worse than the
one level model. The best of the models with more than 2 change-points beat the score for the one level
model, but only very slightly. We cannot, therefore, identify any change-points at all in this time series,
and a model which considers the landfalling rate to be constant in time performs as well as any other.
We could, at this point, stop this study, since we haven’t found any statistical evidence for change points
in the landfalling hurricane time-series. We will, however, press on, since we have strong physical reasons
to think that change points do actually exist. The total number of hurricanes shows clear change points,
and landfalling hurricanes are closely related, both physically and statistically, to the total number of
hurricanes. We now ask: even though we can’t detect any beneﬁt from the modelling of change points
in the landfalling time-series, what indications are there that there might be change points in this time
series? If we had to choose some change points, what would they be? And do the change points we ﬁnd
show any resemblance to those in the total number of hurricanes?
Figure 2 and subsequent ﬁgures show the locations of change points for the optimum models with 1 to
4 change points. The one change point results show a reduction in the number of hurricanes in 1956.
The two change point results show a brief reduction in activity in the 1970s and 1980s, which is perhaps
similar to the reduction in activity from 1970 to 1994 seen in the total number results (see ﬁgure 9
in Jewson and Penzer (2006)). The three change point results show a brief increase in the 1950s, which
again is perhaps similar to something seen in the total number results. The four change points results
show reductions in the 1920s and the 1960s-1970s. Overall, however, we have to conclude that the change
points we identify don’t really match closely with the change points for the basin, although with the
eye of a believer one can perhaps see some similarities. Considering the stability of our optimal change
points, relative to the top 30 results in each case, we see that the results are distinctly less stable than
the equivalent results for basin numbers.

4 Intense landfalling hurricanes

We now repeat our change-point analysis for intense landfalling hurricanes. In the basin data the change
points for the intense hurricanes are more visually striking than those for the total number of hurricanes,
and so one might imagine that it might be possible to detect change points in the intense number of
landfalls even if it is not possible to detect them in the total number of landfalls.
Figure 10 shows the time-series of the number of intense landfalling hurricanes. By eye, it is hard to see
any marked changes in this time series.
Tables 4 and 5 show the change points identiﬁed, with the scores. At least the score now does de-
crease as we move from 0 change points (1 level) to 2 change points (3 levels), suggesting that per-
haps there might be two real change points in this data. However, as we saw in the statistical tests
in Jewson and Penzer (2006), the presence of a minimum in this score is actually no indication of statis-
tical signiﬁcance: what matters is the value at the minimum. Running the same set of statistical tests
we ran in Jewson and Penzer (2006), we ﬁnd that the minimum achieved for the intense landfalling data
is not signiﬁcant at all. Of our 100 random reorderings of the data, the mean of the best RMSE values
achieved was 0.822, which is actually lower than the 0.840 achieved by the optimal RMSE value on the
real data.

5 Discussion

We have performed an objective change point analysis on data for the number of hurricanes making
landfall annually on the US coastline. We did not ﬁnd any evidence for the existence of change points in
this time-series. The change points that our algorithm does detect do not correspond very closely to the
change points that we have found previously in the total number of hurricanes, and are not particularly
stable. These results are consistent with the earlier ﬁndings of Elsner and Jagger (2004), who ran a very
similar analysis but using a very diﬀerent algorithm based on Monte Carlo Markov Chains rather than
brute-force searching.
An interesting avenue of future work would be to examine regionalization, and apply our change point
analysis to the Florida, East Coast and Gulf Coast landfalling hurricane number time series separately.

Elsner and Jagger (2004) found that the only detectable change points were in the Florida time series.
In conclusion: the average number of landfalling hurricanes may change over time, but there is little
evidence for such changes in the landfalling hurricane data considered here. This could either be because
such changes don’t exist, or, perhaps more likely, because there is not enough data to distinguish the
changes from the noise.

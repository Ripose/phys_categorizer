Approximate Equations for Large Scale Atmospheric Motions∗

Introduction.

Recently some meteorologists have attempted to obtain a mathematical description of those large scale
atmospheric motions called long waves. The primary diﬃculty is that the equations of gas dynamics, which
govern the motion of the atmosphere, are so complicated that they have not been satisfactorily solved
analytically, even when viscosity, heat-conduction and moisture are neglected. They are also unsatisfactory
for numerical solution because of the extremely short time intervals which they necessitate.

In attempting to simplify the equations, meteorologists have often obserbed that omission of all acceler-
ation terms from the equations of motion leads to the hydrostatic pressure and geostrophic wind equations.
The ﬁrst of these results is considered to be in extremely close agreement with observation, while the second
result is in fairly close agreement for large scale motions, particularly at high altitudes where topographical
eﬀects are unimportant.

Although such a derivation of these results is logically somewhat unsatifactory, a more serious diﬃculty
arises from the attempt to combine them with the remaining equations (the conservation of mass and
constancy of entropy equations). When the hydrostatic pressure and geostrophic wind are combined with
these equations, it is found that the pressure at the ground is essentially independent of time.

An atempt to overcome this diﬃculty has been made by J. Charney. By using the observed values of
all the quantities entering the equations, he computes the magnitude of each term in the equations. He
In this way he ﬁnds that the acceleration terms in the
then retains the largest terms in each equation.
equations of motion are small, and thus obtains the hydrostatic pressure and geostrophic wind.
In the
mass equation the largest terms are the two which constitute the horizontal divergence of the horizontal
wind, but the vanishing of this divergence does not yield a new result since it follows identicaslly from
the geostrophic wind equations. Therefore, another equation is obtained by diﬀerentiating and combining
the horizontal equations of motion, retaining previously neglected terms, and eliminating the horizontal
divergence by means of the mass equation. The largest terms in the resulting equation are then retained, as
well as the complete entropy equation. In this way a semi-empirical deduction of the hydrostatic pressure
and geostrophic wind equation is given, and a complete set of equations embodying them is obtained. To
futher simplify the equations additional assumptions, such as that the wind is independent of height, are
made.

Nevertheless it still seemed to us that a systematic mathematical derivation of the hydrostatic pressure
and geostrophic wind equations, together with simpliﬁed mass and entropy equations , would be worthwhile.
A method which has been used to derive the shallow water theory, the membrane theory of plates, and the
theory of thin heavy jets immediately suggested itself.

This method involves two steps. First dimensionless variables are introduced which involve a small
parameter that stretches some coordinates and compresses others. The parameter may represent the ratio
of s typical vertical dimension to a typical horizontal dimension of the problem. Then it is assumed that the

solution can be expanded as a power series in this parameter. The expansions are inserted into the equations
and coeﬃcients of each power of the parameter are equated to zero, yielding a sequence of equations for
the successive terms in the solution. If an appropriate choice of dimensionless variables has been made, the
ﬁrst terms in the solution satisfy equations of the expected type. We were guided by Charney’s numerical
estimates in selecting our dimensionless variables.

The result is a simpliﬁed set of equations for the ﬁrst terms in the solutiom, embodying the hydrostatic
pressure and geostrophic wind equations. This set does not suﬀer from the old diﬃculty of yielding a time-
independent pressure at the ground. It is also simpler than the original set, and may yield to approximate
solutions. In fact some appromimate solutions are given in Section 9. Furthermore these simpliﬁed equations
are more suitable for numerical solution than the original equations.

The primary advantage of the present method of derivation is that the dervation of equations, including
the higher order equations, is completely automatic once the change of variables has been made. Thus our
equations are slightly diﬀerent, and in fact simpler, than Charney’s because the expansion scheme determines,
for example, that a particular coeﬃcient should be a known zero order quantity rather a sum of known and
higher order unknown quantities. A less systematic procedure may not yield such results because the order of
magnitude of every term is not noted. A secondary advantage of the method is that the mathematical nature
of the approximation, and its asymptotic character, can be understood, thus leading to an interpretation of
the accompanying boundary layer phenomena.

2 Exact Formulation.

We consider the motion of a non-viscous, non-heat conducting, polytropic gas around the earth. The
equations of motion are written in Eulerian form employing spherical coordinates referred to a rotating
cordinate system. The axis of rotation is taken to be the polar axis. The coordinates are radius r, colatitude
θ and longitude φ, and u, v, w are the respective velocity components. The pressure is p, the density ρ, and
the angular velocity of the coordinate system is Ω, which is the angular velocity of the earth. The only
external force is that of gravity which has the components −G1, −G2 and 0 in the r, θ, φ directions. The
presence of the θ component is due to the non spherical shape of the earth and the non-symmetrical mass
distribution. The surface of the earth is given by r = R(θ, φ) and the velocity of the gas is assumed to be
tangential to the earth at its surface. In addition p and ρ are assumed to approach zero as r becomes inﬁnite.
With these deﬁnitions, the three equations of motion and the equations of conservation of mass and

constancy of entropy for each “particle” become:

Equations (1)–(5) are ﬁve equations for the ﬁve functions u, v, w, p, ρ assuming G1, G2 and R are known, In
addition the initial values of the ﬁve unknown functions are assumed to be given.

It is convenient to introduce the “eﬀective” components of gravity, deﬁned by:

g1 = G1 + Ω2r sin2 θ
g2 = G2 − Ω2rsinθ cos θ.

The formation of the earth is such that at the the surface r = R(θ, φ) the tangential component of
“eﬀective” gravity is nearly zero, Since the earth is almost sphereical, this component is practically g2,
which is consequently small and usually neglected in meteorology.

3 Dimensionless Variables.

It is convenient to introduce the new independent variable z = r − a, a denoting the mean radius of the
earth. Then the surface of the earth is given by z = Z(θ, φ) ≡ R(θ, φ) − a.
We now introduce dimensionless variables by means of the equations:

¯u = ǫ2c0u,
¯v = ǫ2c0v,
¯w = ǫ2c0w,

¯z = ǫ2az,
¯θ = θ0 + ǫθ,
¯φ = φ0 + ǫφ,

¯Z = ǫ4aZ,

µ = Ωac

Here the barred quantities are the old variables and the unbarred quantities are the corresponding dimen-
sionless variables. The quantities θ0, φ0, c0, p0 and ρo are constants; c0 is a velocity and p0, ρ0 are typical
pressure and density values. The quatity ǫ is a small dimensionless parameter which introduces a stretching
in the scale of some quantities and a contraction in the scale of the others. The quantity ǫ2 may be considered
to represent the ratio of a typical vertical dimension of the atmosphere to the radius of the earth, and it is
therefore very small. This small parameter will later provide the basis for a series expansion of the solution.
We also introduce the dimensionless components of “eﬀective” gravity, λ1 and λ2 by the equations

0 = ǫαλ2.

The factor ǫα makes the smallness of g2 aparent, since we assume that α is greater than 3, but is otherwise
unspeciﬁed.

Now, introducing equations 7-10 into equations 1-6 we have:

4 Power Series Solution.

as power series in ǫ. Thus we assume

5 Consequences of the Equations.

Before atttempting to count equations and unknowns, we will simplify the equations by deducing some
obvious consequences of them. First, by using equations 38, 39 in equation 28 we obtain

Integrating with respect to z and applying the boundary condition ρ0 = 0 at z = ∞, we have

Now using equation 18 in equation 42 yields

From equations 44 and 29 we ﬁnd

Using equations 30 and 45, we ﬁnally obtain

Then from equation 44, p0

p0 = p0(z).

Now of the 16 quantities, p0, p1, p2, p3, p4, ρ0, ρ1, ρ2, ρ3, u0, u1, u2, v0, v1, w0, w1, which appear in equations
18-47, two, u0 and u1, are zero (see equations 24, 46). A third, p0, is independent of t (by eq. 47) and is
therefore determined by the initial data. Of the remaining 13 quantities, 9 —ρ0, ρ1, ρ2, ρ3, u2, v0, v1, w0, w1
— are given explicitly in terms of the remaining 4, p1, p2, p3, p4. Of these 4, p4 automatically drops out when
v1 and w1 are eliminated (see eq. 48). Furthermore p2 appears only in the equation for ρ2. Thus if only p1
and p3 can be determined, then p0, p1, p3, ρ0, ρ1, ρ3, u2, v0, w0 will be known.

To obtain equations for the determination of p1 and p3, we ﬁrst attempt to eliminate v1 and w1 from
eq. 34 by means of eqs. 40 and 41. To this end we diﬀerentiate eq. 41 wih respect to φ and divide it by
sin θ0, diﬀerentiate eq. 41 with respect to θ, and subtract the second from the ﬁrst. We then obtain

Equation 49 together with equations 39, 38, 35 and 25 are ﬁve equations involving the six unknown
functions v0, w0, u2, p3, p1. and ρ1. The only other unused equations involving any of these quantities are
equations 26 and 27 which simply imply
(50)

p1 = p1(z, t).

Thus the above equations alone do not seem adequate for the determination of the unknown functions. If one
attempts to supplement them by obtaining equations from the higher order terms in the original equations,
more unknowns are also introduced. Therefore we instead restrict our attention to those solutions for which
p1
t ≡ 0, i. e., we pressume that in any meteorologically signiﬁcant solution if p1 is independent of θ and φ, it
is also independent of t. Then p1 is determined by the initial data, and by equation 25, so is ρ1. Thus we
are left with the four equations 49, 39, 38 and 35 for the four unknown functions v0, w0, u2 and p3.

Equation 35 becomes, since p1

t = ρ1

t = 0,

u2(p0

If the second factor, determined by the initial data, is not zero (implying that the zero order solution is
non-isentropic) then u2 = 0. Equations 49, 39 and 38 then suﬃce to determine v0, w0 and p3.

On the other hand, if the second factor in equation 51 is zero, implying that the zeroth order solution is
isentropic, this equation is useless and we remain with three equations for four unknowns. To obtain another
equation we equate to zero the coeﬃcient of ǫ3 in equation 15 and ﬁnd

Now from equations 32 and 33, p2 is independent of θ and φ. Therefore we rstrict our attention to solutions
p2 independent of t on the basis of the presumption mentioned above. Then by eq. 31 ρ2 is also independent
of t and both p2 and ρ2 are determined by the initial data. Equation 52 now becomes

Here again the second factor may not be zero, implying the solution is not isentropic to ﬁrst order, and
then u2 = 0. Then, as before, equations 49, 39 and 38 suﬃce for the determination of v0, w0 and p3. If
the second factor is zero, equation 53 is useless and we equate to zero the coeﬃcient of ǫ4 in equation 15 to
obtain the additional equation

6 Summary of Results.

By introducing a certain transformation of variables involving a parameter ǫ, and by assuming that the solu-
tion can be expanded in powers of ǫ, we have obtained a simpliﬁed system of equations for the determination
of the ﬁrst terms in the expansion of the solution. These simpliﬁed equations imply that the pressure is
hydrostatic and the horizontal wind geostrophic (to the order in ǫ considered). In the course of the deriva-
tion it was found that p1 and p2 are independent of θ and φ. We consequently restricted our attention
to solutions in which these quantities are also independent of t, presssuming that any other solutions are
not of meteorological importance. There are two sets of simpliﬁed equations, depending upon the degree of
isentropy of the initial data. These two sets are considered separately below.

6.1 Nonisentropic Case.

This case obtains if at least one of the quantities p0
ρ0 )z is not zero. Then u0+ǫu1+ǫ2u2 =
ρ0 ρ0
0, p0(z)+ǫp1(z)+ǫ2p2(z) is given by the initial data and ρ0(z)+ǫρ1(z)+ǫ2ρ2(z)+ǫ3ρ3(θ, φ, z, t) is determined
by the hydrostatic equation. Equations 38, 39 and 49 determine v0, w0 and p3. These equations involve no
z derivatives, and if p = p3/ρ0 is introduced as a new unknown, the coeﬃcients are also independent of z.
The equations then become, omitting the superscript on v0 and w0:

This case obtains if both p0
is given by the initial data and ρ0(z) + ǫρ1(z) + ǫ2ρ2(z) + ǫ3ρ3(θ, φ, z, t) is determined by the hydrostatic
equation. Equations 38, 39, 49 and 54 determine v0, w0, p3 and u2. Omitting superscripts and eliminating

A simpliﬁcation of these equations results if the coeﬃcient of u in equation 61 is zero, which may be called
the extreme isentropic case. Then equations 58, 59 and 61 can be solved for p, w and v and then u can be
found from equation 60.

7 Boundary Layer Eﬀect.

It may be noticed that the initial data must satisfy various conditions, i. e., geostrophic and hydrostatic
equations. Similar conditions must be satisﬁed by the boundary data on the spacial boundaries. Stated
otherwise, all the initial and boundary data cannot be prescribed arbitrarily, as one would have expected.
This is typical of the boundary layer phenomenon which always arises in the asymptotic expansion of the
solution of a system of diﬀerential equations, because of the reduced order of the approximate system. The

question arises as to the proper choice of data for the approximate solution, when the data for the excact
problem are given, in order that the approximate solution best approximate the exact solution away from
the boundaries. This diﬃcult question should not be important in the present case, however, since the
boundaries are not “real” but are within a larger region in which the asymptotic solution is presumably
valid. Therefore the initial and boundary data, if obtained from observations, should satisfy the required

If the atmosphere is barotropic, i. e., if there is a functional relation between p and ρ, then this relation
replaces the entropy equation, eq, 5

To derive the simpliﬁed equations in this case, we proceed exactly as before, but replace all consequences of
eq. 5 by those of eq. 5’. Thus instead of eqs. 22, 29 and 35 we have

p = f (ρ).

p0 = f (ρ0),

p1 = f ′(ρ0)ρ1,

p2 = f

[ρ1]2 + f ′(ρ0)ρ2.

The derivation of eq. 44 is the same as before, but to proceed further we restrict our attention to solutions
p0 independent of t, since p0 is already independent of θ and φ by eqs. 19 and 20. Then from eq. 44 we ﬁnd
that u1 = 0. We further consider only solutions such that p1 and p2 are independent of t, since both are
independent of θ and φ. Equations 38, 39 and 49 follow as before for the determination of v0, w0, p3 and u2.
From equations 38 and 39 we ﬁnd that v0 and w0 are independent of z. To show this, we diﬀerentiate

eq. 38 with repect to z:

(2µ cos θ0)w0

θzρ0 − p3

The last equality follows from eqs. 18 and 37. Now from eq. 5’ we have

pθρz − pzρθ = 0.

Since p0, p1 and p2 are independent of θ and φ, the lowest order term in eq. 63 is p0
consequently zero. Thus from eq. 62, w0

z = 0 and similarly v0

z = 0.

Making use of these results, we can eliminate u2 fron eq. 49 by integrating that equation with respect to

z from 0 to z, obtaining

[p0(z) − p0(0)].

In equation 64 we have made use of eqs. 18 and 36. Now at z = ∞ the left side vanishes, and since p0(∞)
also vanishes while p0(0) is positive, the expression in braces on the right must vanish. This is just equation
57. Since this expression is independent of z, we ﬁnd from eq. 64 that u2 = 0. Therefore the quantities v0, w0
and p3 are determined by eqs. 55, 56 and 57 in the barotropic atmosphere, just as in the non-isentropic case

(Subsection 6.1) for a baroclinic atmosphere. This result is somewhat surprising, since one might expect
the barotropic atmosphere to correspond to the isentropic case. This is also the case, however, for if one
assumes that the atmosphere is exactly isentropic (or at least is up to third order) then eqs. 58 and 59 imply
that v0 and w0 are independent of z; eq. 60 then yields eq. 57 and the result u2 = 0 as above, and eq. 61
becomes an identity.

9 Special Solutions (Nonisentropic Case).

9.1 Zonal Motion: v = pφ = 0

Equations 55 and 57 yield

Thus, with a, b, c arbitrary functions, we have

pθθt = 0.

p = a(t)θ + b(t) + c(θ),
w = (2µ cos θ0)

If we impose periodicity in φ, then α = n (n = 0, ±1, ±2, · · ·) and the integral is replaced by a series.

9.3 Perturbation of Zonal Motion.

Assume a solution analytic in a parameter η which yields a steady zonal motion for η = 0. The solution
may be written:

p = p0(θ) + ηp1(θ, φ, t) + η2p2 + · · · ,

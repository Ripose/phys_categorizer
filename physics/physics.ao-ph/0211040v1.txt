Introduction

Aerosols, both natural and anthropogenic, play an important role in the atmospheric
science, by imparting radiative forcing and perturbing the radiative balance of the Earth
atmosphere system as well as by degrading the environment. To understand the eﬀect
of aerosols on our geo/biosphere system, it is essential to characterize their physical
and chemical properties regionally because of the regional nature of their properties and
the short lifetime (Moorthy et al. 1999, 1989, Satheesh et al. 2001). As most of the
aerosol sources are of terrestrial origin the variability of their properties will be very
large close to the surface. At higher altitudes, above the mixing region, and in the
free troposphere, the aerosol characteristics have a more synoptic perspective; would
be indicative of the background level and are useful to understand long-term impacts.
Such systematic measurements of aerosols at high altitudes are practically non-existing in
India. Realising the potential and need for such studies, an activity has been initiated at
Manora Peak, Nainital in the Shivalik Hills of Central Himalayas at an altitude of ∼2 km.
The present paper provides the preliminary results of these aerosol measurements. These
daytime measurements are compared with the existing earlier nighttime measurements.

2. Observational data and analysis

The daytime observations for aerosol optical depths were made for 68 clear-sky days
during January 2002 to June 2002, with Multi-Wavelength Solar Radiometer (MWR)
designed and developed by the Space Physics Laboratory (SPL), Thiruvananthapuram.
The MWR was installed at Manora Peak, Nainital (1965 m msl). The instrument provides
aerosol spectral optical depth at ten narrow (FWHM of 6 to 10 nm) spectral bands
centered at 380, 400, 450, 500, 600, 650, 750, 850, 935, and 1025 nm, by making continuous
spectral extinction measurements of directly transmitted solar radiation (Moorthy et
al. 1999). The nighttime extinction measurements were carried out regularly at the
observatory using broad band (FWHM ∼ 60 nm) ﬁlters with eﬀective wavelengths around
360, 450 and 550 nm using stellar sources. These mesurements are available for about
800 nights between 1964 to 1988 (Kumar et al. 2000).

Each set of MWR observation comprises time measured with seconds accuracy and the
output voltage Vλ. The data are recorded from morning to evening and optical depths
are estimated following the Langley technique (Moorthy et al. 1999). A preliminary
analysis of the aerosol measurements indicated the occurence of diﬀerent least squares ﬁt

to the data on several days, with diﬀerent slopes for the forenoon (FN) and afternoon
(AN) parts of the same day implying diﬀerent optical depths. As such, these data were
analysed separately and in total we have 90 data sets spanning over the 68 observation
days spread over nearly 6 months.

3. Results and discussions

The temporal variation of the daytime aerosol optical depths estimated using the MWR
are shown in Fig. 1 as a function of the Julian days. Except a few days in April, FN
AODs are lower by 0.02 to 0.2 than the corresponding AN values. With a view to examine
the temporal variation with the earlier nighttime values, the archived nighttime aerosol
measurements (broad bands) at 0.36 µm and 0.44 µm, were used. The individual values
were grouped into fortnightly ensembles and averaged separately for the daytime data
(at 380 nm and 450 nm) and nighttime data (at 360 nm and 440 nm). The temporal
variations are shown in Fig. 2; on the top panel of which the AOD at 750 nm from MWR
are also given. The wavelength dependence of aerosol optical depths in diﬀerent months
for the MWR data is plotted in Fig. 3.

The primary features of the aerosol optical depths (Fig. 1) are (i) low values in winter;
(ii) a rather spontaneous increase from spring and (iii) reaching a peak by summer; when
the AOD values are nearly 4 times the winter values. The increase is more spontaneous at
the longer wavelengths (0.75µm), while at the shorter wavelengths it is more gradual. This
is attributed to increased convective activity in summer taking place in the lower plains
due to increased solar heating and the resulting aerosols are lifted to higher altitudes by
turbulent exchange. As the turbulence increases towards summer, even larger particles are
lifted up causing a spontaneous increase in the AOD at the long wavelength also. Another
feature, the FN AOD being lower than the AN values, arises due to the environmental
diﬀerence; in the FN, the solar ray path is primarily through the cleaner mountain ranges
in the east whereas in the evening the dusty and inhabitated valley intercepts the ray path.
Both the daytime and nighttime AOD’s show similar trends; except that the nighttime
AOD’s tend to be higher than the daytime counter parts during winter and vice versa in
summer. This aspect and its relation to the micrometerology as well as the eﬀect of the
bandwidth need further investigation.

The authors thank the technical staﬀ of the State Observatory, Nainital for providing
valuable help during observations.

Abstract

The radiation from the mixed layer into the interior of the ocean of near-inertial
oscillations excited by a passing storm in the presence of the beta eﬀect is reconsidered
as an initial-value problem. Making use of the fact that the mixed layer depth is much
smaller than the total depth of the ocean, the solution is obtained in the limit of an
ocean that is eﬀectively inﬁnitely deep. For a uniform initial condition, analytical
results for the velocity, horizontal kinetic energy density and ﬂuxes are obtained. The
resulting decay of near-inertial mixed layer energy in the presence of the beta eﬀect
occurs on a timescale similar to that observed.

1 Introduction

There is much observational evidence, starting with Webster (1968) and Pollard and Millard
(1970), that storms can excite near-inertial currents in the mixed layer of the ocean. This
phenomenon is evident in observations from the Ocean Storms Experiment (D’Asaro et al.
1995, Levine and Zervakis 1995, Qi et al. 1995). Simple models which treat the mixed layer as
a solid slab have been quite successful at explaining the process by which wind generates such
currents (see, e.g., Pollard and Millard (1970), D’Asaro (1985)). A weakness of the model of
Pollard and Millard (1970) is that it explains the decay of these currents with an arbitrary
decay constant. Much subsequent work has attempted to determine the detailed character-
istics of this decay, with possible mechanisms including nonlinear interactions which transfer
energy to other frequencies (Henyey et al. 1986), turbulent dissipation (Hebert and Moum
1993), and the radiation of downward propagating near-inertial oscillations (NIOs) excited

1

by inertial pumping into the interior of the ocean (Gill 1984). The downward radiation of
NIOs will be the focus of this paper.

Observations give a timescale for the decay of the energy deposited by the passing storm
on the order of ten to twenty days (D’Asaro et al. 1995, Levine and Zervakis 1995, Qi et al.
1995). This timescale stands in contrast with estimates such as that by Gill (1984) that near-
inertial currents decaying through the downward propagation of NIOs and with a horizontal
length scale typical of the atmospheric forcing mechanism can remain in the mixed layer for
longer than a year. To account for this diﬀerence, several mechanisms for the enhancement
of vertical propagation of NIOs have been suggested. D’Asaro (1989) demonstrated that the
β-eﬀect causes a reduction of horizontal scales because the meridional wavenumber evolves
βt, where l0 is the initial wavenumber, and l < 0 corresponds to
according to l = l0
southward propagation; this accelerates the rate of inertial pumping of energy out of the
mixed layer, thereby enhancing the decay. The decay is also enhanced through interaction
with background geostrophic or quasigeostrophic ﬂow (e.g. Balmforth et al. 1998, Balmforth
and Young 1999, and van Meurs 1998).

This paper reconsiders the vertical propagation of near-inertial energy deposited into the
mixed layer by a storm, in the presence of the β-eﬀect, using a diﬀerent approach from that
of D’Asaro (1989). The analysis uses the formalism of Young and Ben Jelloul (1997) which
is outlined in Section 2. In Section 3, a simpliﬁed model with three main assumptions is
presented. First, the background ﬂow is assumed to be constant in the zonal direction (i.e.
independent of longitude with zero vorticity). Second, the buoyancy frequency is taken to be
small in the mixed layer, and constant in the ocean interior (i.e. beneath the mixed layer).
Third, it is assumed that the storm has moved very rapidly across the ocean and has created
a horizontally uniform near-inertial current to the east concentrated within the mixed layer:
it is the subsequent evolution of this motion that is examined. Section 4 uses the fact that
the depth of the ocean is very much larger than the mixed layer depth to formulate and solve
the model for an ocean which is eﬀectively inﬁnitely deep. Section 5 discusses the results
and suggests directions for further investigation.

2 The NIO equation

We consider an ocean of inﬁnite horizontal extent and depth D, with the mixed layer compris-
Hmix.

The x and y axes are taken to point to the east and north, respectively. The buoyancy fre-
quency N = N(z) is an arbitrary piecewise continuous function of depth z.

Thus barotropic motion is not included in the analysis. However Gill (1984) has shown that
the barotropic response to a storm is instantaneous and the associated currents are weak.

3 A Simpliﬁed Model

To simplify the analysis, we assume that A and ψ do not vary in the x-direction, and that
ζ = 0. The analysis thus neglects the eﬀect of background barotropic vorticity but crucially
keeps the β-eﬀect. The buoyancy frequency proﬁle is taken to be

where ǫ
1. Finally, the storm is assumed to have produced an initial condition of a
horizontally uniform near-inertial current to the east concentrated within the mixed layer.
Instead of approaching this problem by use of an integral operator as in D’Asaro (1989) or
by projecting onto normal modes (e.g., Gill 1984, Balmforth et al. 1998), the problem will be
formulated as an initial value problem on a semi-inﬁnite domain corresponding to an ocean
that is eﬀectively inﬁnitely deep. In order to formulate the problem properly for this limit,
this section considers an ocean of ﬁnite depth. In Section 4 the solution in the limit that the
depth of the interior is much greater than the mixed layer depth will be found.

This formulation as a radiation problem which ignores the presence of the ocean bottom
requires the projection of the initial condition to be spread across all the normal modes.
This is certainly true for small mixed layer depths in the model of Gill (1984), as shown
in Table 1 of that paper; also see Table 1 of Zervakis and Levin (1995). For deeper mixed
layers, this is no longer true since half the initial energy becomes concentrated in the ﬁrst
two or three modes. However, as pointed in Section 7 of Gill (1984), the depth of the ocean
“inﬂuences the rate of loss of energy by imposing modulations on the rate, but the average
rate of loss is not aﬀected very much by depth changes”. Hence the results presented here
should be qualitatively relevant even when the continuum assumption is not valid.

3.1 Nondimensionalization

Quantities are nondimensionalized according to

ˆy = y/Y,

ˆz = 1 + z/Hmix,

Typical values β = 10−11 m−1s−1, Hmix = 100 m, f0 = 10−4 s−1, N0 = 10−2 s−1 give Y = 105
m and Ω = 10−6 s−1. The relevant timescale is thus Ω−1 = 11.5 days. Also, the velocity and
the ﬁeld A are nondimensionalized by

This nondimensionalization allows some immediate conclusions to be drawn about the
if Hmix increases, then the
propagation of NIO energy downwards. Most importantly,
timescale Ω−1 decreases. Thus, assuming that the storm causes a uniform near-inertial
current throughout the whole mixed layer, energy transfer will be faster for a deeper mixed
layer. This conﬁrms the results of Gill (1984), which associated the more eﬃcient transfer
with a larger projection of the initial velocity proﬁle on the ﬁrst vertical mode.

3.2 Boundary Condition at the Base of the Mixed Layer

implies that A0 is independent of z. At

Results obtained in the ocean interior using (9) are in fact leading-order solutions. We
shall continue to use the notation A, even though it is really the leading-order term in the
expansion.

3.3

Initial Condition

Suppose that in a short time compared with the NIO wave propagation time, the passing
storm induces near-inertial currents in the mixed layer with a horizontal scale that is much
larger than the one under consideration, and which can hence be taken to be uniform. For
simplicity, the initial velocity (consistent with equation (3)) is assumed to be piecewise
constant with depth:

(u, v) = (1, 0)

0 < z < 1,

H −1, 0),

H < z < 0.

The weak ﬂow in the ocean interior is necessary to ensure that the ﬂow has no barotropic
component. Integrating equation (6) with respect to z and using the boundary conditions

4 Solution for an Inﬁnitely Deep Ocean

The total depth of the ocean is typically on the order of a hundred times the depth of the
mixed layer. Thus, the limit of inﬁnite depth is considered. The initial condition is taken
to be equation (11) with H
is taken to be
Azz →
0, corresponding to the near-inertial velocities vanishing at inﬁnite depth. Of course,
this limit excludes the possibility of reﬂections oﬀ the bottom of the ocean which may be
important. Finally, the boundary condition for z = 0− given by equation (9) is used. Hence
the problem to be solved for the semi-inﬁnite domain z < 0 becomes

4.1 NIO velocity ﬁeld

These equations may be solved using Laplace transforms. Here we present only the major
results; further details are given in Moehlis (1999). We make the transformations A(y, z, t) =
e−iyt ˜B(z, T ), T

This Laplace transform and its derivatives with respect to z must be inverted numerically

We now consider the back-rotated velocity Azz = eif0t(u + iv), which ﬁlters out purely
inertial motion at frequency f0. Back-rotated velocities may be represented by hodographs
which show the vector (Re(Azz), Im(Azz)) as curves parametrized by time. For f0 > 0,
if these curves are traced out in a clockwise (counterclockwise) fashion, the corresponding
motion has frequency larger (smaller) than f0. Figure 1 shows the back-rotated velocity
at diﬀerent locations. A common characteristic is that the magnitude of the back-rotated
velocity starts at zero, reaches a peak value shortly after the storm, then decays away. The
depth dependence of the back-rotated velocity is seen by comparing Figure 1 (a) and (b),
where both have y = 0 and thus the same value of the Coriolis parameter f . Qualitatively the
results are the same, but closer to the mixed layer the direction change of the back-rotated
velocity becomes slower, meaning that the frequency is closer to f0. An idea of the latitudinal
dependence is seen by comparing Figure 1 (a,c,d): at y = 1 the hodograph is traced out in a
clockwise fashion as for y = 0, but at y =
2 it is traced out in a counterclockwise fashion.

Since the energy which leaves the mixed layer enters the interior of the ocean, this implies
that for short times the energy in the interior increases like t3/2. This does not contradict the
result from D’Asaro (1989) that for short times the thermocline energy grows like t6. That
result assumes that the wind persists to generate a constant inertially oscillating velocity,
and that there is no propagating inertial motion. Here, the wind has an instantaneous eﬀect,
causing an initial horizontally uniform inertial current, and propagating inertial motion is
included fully.

Another quantity of interest is the ﬂux of HKE. Using (4) and its complex conjugate

depths below z =
appropriate Laplace transforms are shown in Figure 3. FE peaks at the nondimensionalized
time t
0.62; for the typical values quoted in Section 3.1, this corresponds to about a week
after the storm. From Figure 3(b) and using the fact that whatever energy ﬂows through
z = 0− must have initally been in the mixed layer, we see that by t = 1 (about 11.5 days
after the storm) nearly half of the energy associated with horizontal NIO currents caused
by the storm has left the mixed layer; however, only about 38% of the total energy has
1. By t = 2 (about 23 days after the storm), 82% of the total energy
penetrated below z =
has left the mixed layer, but only 58% has penetrated below z =
1. Thus, at t = 2 nearly a
quarter of the total energy is contained in the distance Hmix immediately beneath the mixed
layer. This is reminiscent of the accumulation of NIO energy below the mixed layer seen in
Balmforth, Llewellyn Smith and Young (1998). This model thus gives reasonable estimates
for example, D’Asaro et al.
for the timescale for which the decay of NIO energy occurs:

(1995) found that the mixed layer inertial energy was reduced to background levels by 21
days after the storm.

Figure 4 shows the vertical dependence of the HKE and FE at diﬀerent times. As time
increases the instantaneous distribution of HKE becomes more sharply peaked near the base
of the mixed layer, but remains bounded (asymptotically approaching unity) because of
energy conservation.

4.3 Large-time behavior

The asymptotic behavior of near-inertial properties may be derived using the method of
steepest descents (see Moehlis 1999 for details). This shows that in the limit of large ξ

0t3/3,

.

A useful way to represent the asymptotic results is to write η0 in terms of z and t and then
draw contour plots of quantities of physical interest in the (z, t) plane: this is shown in
Figure 5. In the asymptotic limit for large ξ, with z constant, u2 + v2 and FE decrease as
time increases. Note that ξ is large for suﬃciently large z and/or t.

Finally, Moehlis (1999) also obtained results for the vertical shear u2

z . To leading
order in ǫ, the vertical shear within the mixed layer is zero. The results for vertical shear for

the interior of the ocean lack physical realism because the model allows the shear to grow
forever as a consequence of the initial inﬁnite shear due to the discontinuity in the initial
velocity proﬁle.

5 Conclusion

A simpliﬁed model has been developed to examine the decay due to the β-eﬀect of near-
inertial currents excited in the mixed layer by a passing storm. This decay occurs due
to the radiation of downward propagating NIOs into the interior of the ocean. The main
assumptions of the model are that the background ﬂow does not vary in the longitudinal
direction and has no associated vorticity, that the ocean has a simple (piecewise constant)
buoyancy frequency proﬁle, and that the storm has moved very quickly over the ocean causing
a horizontally uniform near-inertial current concentrated in the mixed layer. The β-eﬀect is
included in the analysis and is responsible for the radiation of NIOs. Because the depth of
the mixed layer is much smaller than the total depth of the ocean, the problem is formulated
in the limit of an eﬀectively inﬁnitely deep ocean; the resultant initial value problem is solved
by Laplace transforms. Analytical results are given for the horizontal kinetic energy density

in the mixed layer, and results from the numerical inversion of the appropriate Laplace
transforms are given for horizontal kinetic energy, energy ﬂux, and back-rotated velocity.
The asymptotic behavior is also investigated.

Although this simpliﬁed model cannot be expected to capture the full complexity of the
aftermath of a storm passing the ocean, it does capture much of the observed behavior.
Most importantly, in the presence of the β-eﬀect the decay of near-inertial mixed layer
energy is found to occur on the appropriate timescale (approximately twenty days), which
conﬁrms the analysis of D’Asaro (1989) and observations by D’Asaro et al. (1995), Levine
and Zervakis (1995), and Qi et al. (1995). The main advantage of the approach described in
this paper is that many aspects of the decay in the mixed layer are analytically obtained for
all times, unlike D’Asaro (1989) which predicts the timescale for the decay in a short time
limit or estimates it in terms of the time it takes normal modes to become out of phase (cf.
Gill 1984). Extensions to a more realistic ocean and storm would involve including a more
realistic buoyancy frequency proﬁle (for example, the proﬁle used by Gill 1984), considering
the eﬀect of diﬀerent initial velocities (including both horizontal and vertical structure), and
considering the eﬀect of background ﬂow. The study of all of these could use the same
formalism of Young and Ben Jelloul (1997) and an approach similar to that presented here.

ON THE FORMULATION OF LAGRANGIAN
STOCHASTIC MODELS FOR GEOPHYSICAL
TURBULENT FLOWS

Abstract
The formulation of Lagrangian stochastic models
for geophysical ﬂows characterised by non homoge-
neous conditions nees to satisfy the so-called “well
mixed condition”. Simpliﬁed formulations are used
sometimes in literature generally associated to at-
mospheric and/or oceanic ﬂows. The simpliﬁcations
introduced lead to anomalous dispersion conditions.
Some simple case is discussed, assessing the impact
of the mean ﬂow structure on the disperision features
of passive tracers.

1 Introduction
Lagrangian Stochastic Models (LSM) for turbulent
dispersion of passive tracers are the focus of increas-
ing attention by the geophysical ﬂuid ﬂow community,
as a means of understanding and describing turbulent
dispersion in complex ﬂows, since the fundamental
ideas expressed by Obukhov (1959). A useful review
of early approaches is reported in Etling et al. (1986).
The soundest basis for LSM was provided by
the work of Thomson (1987), who ﬁrst prescribed
a rigorous constraint which deﬁnes the frame to de-
velop LSM consistently with given Eulerian proper-
ties. This constraint, usually called Well Mixed Con-
dition (WMC), simply states a sort of entropy law re-
quiring that a tracer which is well mixed in the phase
space at a certain time, must remain so at later times.
Since Thomson (1987), theoretical studies have in-
vestigated various properties of LSM (see Wilson and
Sawford, 1996, for a review) and practical applica-
tions have increased (see, e.g., Franzese et al., 1999;
Rao, 1999, for recent applications to the convective
and stable boundary layers, respectively), mainly in
atmospheric environment. The attention of oceanog-
raphers is relatively recent (see, e.g., Griﬀa, 1996, for
a review), and some doubts have arisen on the correct
application in this ﬁeld (Brickman and Smith, 2002).
Although some attempts to develop models which do
not satisfy the WMC are occasionally performed, it
continues to play a key role, being the only physically
sound criterion found up to now.

While WMC does not provide a completely closed
formulation in more than one dimension, it consti-
tutes a basic requirement to satisfy. A WM model
must be formulated in terms of the Eulerian Prob-
ability Density Function (PDF) of the whole ﬂow.
However, in practical applications the usual approach
is sometimes based on formulations in terms of ﬂuc-
tuations with respect to a mean ﬂow. The validity
of this view is rigorous only in the case of a uniform
mean velocity ﬁeld, which is almost always inconsis-
tent with real geophysical cases.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the short-
comings of this approach giving, with the aid of sim-
pliﬁed examples, the “feeling” of the eﬀect of this
inconsistency.
It will also shown, more in general,
how non homogeneous mean ﬂows inﬂuence disper-

sion, evidencing the necessity of a correct formulation
of dispersion models.

In the next section the correct formulation will be
compared to the simpliﬁed one pointing out theoret-
ical inconsistencies, while in section 3 the two formu-
lations will be compared for a simple ﬂow mimicking
a surface circulation in a closed basin. Some key of
interpretation is then given by means of very simple
shear ﬂows.

2 Model formulation and Well Mixed-

ness

In geophysical ﬂuid dynamics applications, LSM are
usually formulated in terms of ﬂuctuation about a
mean ﬂow. The mean ﬂow can be the ﬂow ﬁeld
that results from a circulation model or a measured
ﬁeld (e.g., from drifters). Mean ﬂow from models
is intended as an ensemble average when Reynolds-
averaged equations (i.e., when stresses depend on the
ﬂow and not on the grid dimension) are considered.
On the other hand, in cases of instantaneous ﬁltered
ﬂow ﬁeld (Large Eddy Simulations), ﬂuctuations are
a measure of the subgrid turbulence and depend on
the grid size (e.g., for the Smagorinsky model, to con-
sider a very simple example).

For sake of simplicity let us consider a statisti-
cally stationary and homogeneous ﬂuctuating ﬁeld
u′ about a stationary mean ﬂow U function of po-
sition x. Formulation of the stochastic model only
in terms of the ﬂuctuating part, follows from consid-
ering a stochastic diﬀerential equation (SDE) for the
ﬂuctuating component

′
i = a
du

′

i(x, u′

) dt + bij(x, u′

) dWj

(1)

where time dependence is omitted because of assumed
stationarity. Equation (1) can be simpliﬁed using
the following considerations: 1) in order to main-
tain consistency between the ˆIto and Stratonovich
calculus, bij cannot depend on the stochastic variable
(van Kampen, 1981); 2) as we consider here a homo-
geneous turbulence ﬁeld, bij must itself be homoge-
neous; for the same reason, ai is also homogeneous. 3)
bij drives the magnitude of small scale forcing; assum-
ing scales in the inertial subrange, this behaviour can
be considered universal according to the Kolmogorov
(1941) theory, and is therefore essentially isotropic.
The result is that bij = (C0ε)1/2δij , where ε is the
rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE)
and C0 is a universal constant. ε is usually estimated
through macroscopic variables as ε = (2σ2)(C0τ )−1
(Tennekes, 1982), where σ2 is the variance of a com-
ponent of the (isotropic) turbulent ﬁeld (i.e., two-
third of TKE) and τ is the Lagrangian decorrelation
time scale, which does not correspond in general to
the Lagrangian integral time (Maurizi and Lorenzani,
2001).

Associated to Eq. (1) is the deterministic equation

for position

′
dxi = [Ui(x) + u
i] dt

(2)

which actually states that the motion of a passive
tracer has to be considered as the motion following
the mean ﬂow plus a ﬂuctuation. Because ﬂuctua-
tions are correlated in time as a result of Eq. (1), the
model have to be considered Markovian for the joint
variable (x, u) where u ≡ U + u′.

As the formulation of the stochastic model re-
quires the use of a Fokker-Plank equation associated
to the SDE, the correct formulation requires the cor-
rect deﬁnition of the process equations. SDE for u
can be written as

′
dui = dUi + du
i

where, remembering the stationarity of the mean
ﬂow,

dUi = DtUi dt ≡ Uk∂xk Ui dt .

Therefore, the ﬁnal form of the set of SDE is

dui = [Uk∂xk Ui + a′
dxi = [Ui(x) + u′
i] dt

(cid:26)

i(x, u′)] dt + bij(x, u′) dWj

(5)
of the ﬁrst
in which the ﬁrst term on the r.h.s.
equation evidences some contribution from the spatial
variation of the mean ﬂow. The associated Fokker-
Planck (FP) equation reads

pL +

(akpL) =

(6)

where pL is the Lagrangian pdf of (x, u). Using the
WMC (i.e., replacing pL with pE), Equation (6) be-
comes an equation for ai ≡ [Uk∂xk Ui + a′

i(x, u′)]:

where φi must satisfy

One of the simplest assumptions usually made is
i turbulence ﬁeld is homogeneous, stationary

that u′
and Gaussian, and that

′

i(x, u′

a

) = − u′
i
τii

(no summation implied over repeated indices), where
τii is the Lagrangian correlation time for i component.
In this case, Eq. (1) reduces to the one-dimensional
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. However, it is easy to
show that this form of the drift coeﬃcient is not con-
sistent with the WMC, i.e., Eq. (9) is not a solution
of Eq. (7). In fact, from Eq. (9) and the deﬁnition of
ai, it turns out that

φi = (Uk∂xk Ui)pE

(10)

which cannot be a solution of Eq. (8).

A correct (WM) form of the drift coeﬃcient, al-
though not unique, is given by Thomson (1987, p.
547, hereinafter T87):

(9)

which diﬀers from Eq. (9) by the term second term
on the r.h.s. This term describes a coupling between
the stochastic ﬁeld and its mean value. This lack is
the main ﬂaw of the simpliﬁed formulation described
by Eq. (9). In the following section an assessment of
the eﬀects introduced by the incorrect formulations
is performed in comparison with correct results.
3 A simple example
In order to show the diﬀerences between the two for-
mulations, we made the choice of modelling turbulent
dispersion in a two dimensional closed basin (or semi-
enclosed), bearing in mind the surface ﬂow in a closed
marine basin such as the Adriatic Sea (see, e.g., La-
corata et al., 2001).

A very schematic mean ﬂow is assumed in a two-
dimensional box of dimension Lx and Ly. The ﬂow
is itself two-dimensional and incompressible and thus
a streamfunction ψ(x, y) can be deﬁned as

ψ(x, y) = A sin(π

) sin(π

(12)

x
Lx

y
Ly

)

(Fig. 1), where A drives the amplitude of the mean
ﬂow. For the sake of simplicity, turbulence is as-
sumed as a homogeneous, isotropic, stationary, Gaus-
sian process. More complex and realistic cases could
be studied ((Maurizi et al., 2004, see, e.g., )), but are
beyond the scope of this work. The parameters used
here are: A = 104 ms−1, Lx = 2 × 105 m, Ly = 105 m;
and for turbulence parameters: σ = 0.05 ms−1 and
τ = 2 × 105 s.

Both the simpliﬁed and T87 models are used to
test whether the WMC is satisﬁed or not. T87 gives
the expected result, i.e., it maintains the initially uni-
form distribution (Fig. 1a for t = 0) as expected. The
results of the simpliﬁed model can be appreciated in
Fig. 1b, where the spatial distribution of 105 tracer
particles (drifters) is shown at a later stage of evolu-
tion (t = 2T , with T = L(πA)−1 the typical advec-
tion time deﬁned in terms of the mean characteristic
y)1/2), when they increasingly ac-
length L = (L2
cumulate near the boundaries (where perfect reﬂect-
ing conditions were assumed).

in

To understand the results shown in the previous sec-
tion, it is important to underline that the dispersion
in a ﬂow with a non uniform mean velocity ﬁeld de-
pends strongly on the ﬂow structure itself. This can
be inferred from a classical result (Monin and Yaglom,
1971, p. 556), which shows that the mean square dis-
persion in a plane shear grows in the streamwise di-
rection with the third power of time. Another known
result (Borgas et al., 1997, see, e.g., ) is that rotation
inhibits dispersion and reduces the diﬀusion coeﬃ-
cient (when it exists).

In order to give some insight into the eﬀects of
the mean ﬂow structure on the LSM formulation, it
is useful to think of the mean ﬂow structure as a su-
perposition of two components: strain and rotation.
For a two-dimensional ﬂow a useful measure of this
fact is the Okubo-Weiss (OW) parameter, deﬁned as

Q =

(S2 − W 2)

(13)

ai = − ui − Ui

+ uk

τ

∂Ui
∂xk

where S = det(S) and W = det(W) with S and W
the rate of strain and rate of rotation matrices, re-
spectively.

Figure 2: Okubo-Weiss parameter and mean ﬁeld vec-
tors.

For the ﬂow described by Eq. (12), the Okubo-
Weiss parameter is represented in Fig. 2 along with
the mean ﬁeld vectors.
Zones with negative Q
are strain dominated, while positive Q indicates the
prevalence of rotation.

The dispersion process is expected to behave dif-
ferently in regions with diﬀerent properties. In order
to understand the model properties, we analyse the
behaviour of the two formulations in ﬂows with ex-
treme values of the OW parameter. As anticipated,
a classical result is found (Monin and Yaglom, 1971,
p. 556) for dispersion in linear shear ﬂow.
In two
dimension the mean ﬁeld is U(x) = (αx2, 0). The
shear tensor reads

Analytical results only exist for the “pure shear”
case, because in the other cases symmetry (or anti-
symmetry) of matrices does not allow for variable
separation. Therefore, simulations with the simpli-
ﬁed and WM formulations were performed to com-
pare model performances. Figure 3a,b,c compares
the results of the two models for α = 0.2 s−1 for
the “pure shear”, “pure strain” and “pure rotation”
cases. Although no appreciable diﬀerences can be ob-
served for the “pure shear” case, more relevant diﬀer-
ences are observed in the other cases. In particular,
in the “pure strain” case, where a strong increase of
mean square displacement is observed, the diﬀerence
between the two models reach almost an order of mag-
nitude at the end of simulation. For the “pure rota-
tion” case, it is observed that, while the WM model
shows the expected asymptotic result (i.e., a linear
growth with time), the simpliﬁed model seems not to
converge to this behaviour.

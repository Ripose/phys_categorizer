Abstract

We consider two ways that one might convert a prediction of sea surface temperature (SST) into a
prediction of landfalling hurricane numbers. First, one might regress historical numbers of landfalling
hurricanes onto historical SSTs, and use the ﬁtted regression relation to predict future landfalling
hurricane numbers given predicted SSTs. We call this the direct approach. Second, one might regress
basin hurricane numbers onto historical SSTs, estimate the proportion of basin hurricanes that make
landfall, and use the ﬁtted regression relation and estimated proportion to predict future landfalling
hurricane numbers. We call this the indirect approach. Which of these two methods is likely to work
better? We answer this question in the context of a simple abstract model.

1 Introduction

There is a great need to predict the distribution of the number of hurricanes that might make landfall in
the US in the next few years. Such predictions are of use to all the entities that are aﬀected by hurricanes,
ranging from local and national governments to insurance and reinsurance companies. How, then, should
we make such predictions? There is no obvious best method. For instance, one might consider making a
prediction based on time-series analysis of the time-series of historical landfalling hurricane numbers; one
might consider making a prediction of basin hurricane numbers using time-series analysis, and convert
that prediction to a prediction of landfalling hurricane numbers; one might consider trying to predict
SSTs ﬁrst, and convert that prediction to a prediction of landfalling numbers; or one might try and use
output from a numerical model of the climate system. All of these are valid approaches, and each has
their own pros and cons.
In this article, we consider the idea of ﬁrst predicting SST and then predicting hurricane numbers given
a prediction of SST. There are two obvious ﬂavours of this. The ﬁrst is what we will call the ‘direct’
(or ‘one-step’) method, in which one regresses historical numbers of landfalling hurricanes directly onto
historical SSTs, and uses the ﬁtted regression relation to convert a prediction of future SSTs into a
prediction of future hurricane numbers. The second is what we will call the ‘indirect’ (or ‘two-step’)
method, in which one regresses basin hurricane numbers onto historical SSTs, predicts basin numbers,
and then predicts landfalling numbers from basin numbers. In the simplest version of the indirect method
one might predict landfalling numbers as a constant proportion of the number of basin hurricanes, where
this proportion is estimated using historical data.
Consideration of the direct and indirect SST-based methods motivates the question: at a theoretical level,
which of these two methods is likely to work best? This is a statistical question about the properties
of regression and proportion models. We consider this abstract question in the context of a simple but
realistic model, in which we use observed SSTs, the mean number of hurricanes in the basin is a linear
function of SST, and each basin hurricane has a constant probability of making landfall.
We don’t think the answer as to which of the direct or indirect methods is better is a priori obvious.
On the one hand, the direct method has fewer parameters to estimate, which might work in its favour.
On the other hand, the indirect method allows us to use more data by incorporating the basin hurricane
numbers into the analysis.

2 Methods

We compare the direct and indirect methods described above as follows.

2.1 Generating artiﬁcial basin hurricane numbers

First, we simulate 10,000 sets of artiﬁcial basin hurricane numbers for the period 1950-2005, giving a total
of 10,000 x 56 = 560,000 years of simulated hurricane numbers. These numbers are created by sampling
from poisson distributions with mean given by:

λ = α + βS

(1)

where S is the observed MDR SST for each year in the period 1950-2005. The values of α and β are
derived from model 4 in table 7 in Binter et al. (2006), in which observed basin hurricane numbers were
regressed onto observed SSTs using data for 1950-2005. They have values of 6.25 and 5, respectively.
The basin hurricane numbers we create by this method should contain roughly the same long-term SST
driven variability as the observed basin hurricane numbers, but diﬀerent numbers of hurricanes in the
individual years. We say ‘roughly’ the same, because (a) the linear model we are using to relate SST to
hurricane numbers is undoubtedly not exactly correct, although given the analysis in Binter et al. (2006)
is certainly seems to be reasonable, and (b) the parameters of the linear model are only estimated.

2.2 Generating artiﬁcial landfalling hurricane numbers

Given the 10,000 sets of simulated basin hurricane numbers described above, we then create 10,000 sets of
simulated landfalling hurricane numbers by applying the rule that each basin hurricane has a probability
of 0.254 of making landfall (this value is taken from observed data for 1950-2005).
The landfalling hurricane numbers we create by this method should contain roughly the same long-
term SST driven variability as the observed landfalling series, but diﬀerent numbers of hurricane in the
individual years. They should also contain roughly the right dependency structure between the number
of hurricanes in the basin and the number at landfall (e.g. that years with more hurricanes in the basin
will tend to have more hurricanes at landfall).

2.3 Making predictions

We now have 10,000 sets of 56 years of artiﬁcial data for basin and landfalling hurricanes. This data con-
tains a realistic representation of the SST-driven variability of hurricane numbers, and of the dependency
structure between the numbers of hurricanes in the basin and at landfall, but diﬀerent actual numbers
of hurricanes from the observations. We can consider this data as 10,000 realisations of what might
have occurred over the last 56 years, had the SSTs been the same, but the evolution of the atmosphere
diﬀerent. This data is a test-bed that can help us understand aspects of the predictability of landfalling
hurricanes given SST.
The observed and simulated data is illustrated in ﬁgures 1 to 5. Figure 1 shows the observed basin
data (solid black line) and the observed landfall data (solid grey line). The dashed black line shows
the variability in the observed basin data that is explained using SSTs. The dotted grey line shows the
variability in the observed landfall data that is explained using SSTs using the direct method, and the
dotted grey line shows the variability in the landfall data that is explained using SSTs using the indirect
method.
Figures 2 to 5 show 4 realisations of the simulated data. In each ﬁgure the dotted and dashed lines are
the same as in ﬁgure 1, and show the SST driven signal. The solid black line then shows the simulated
basin hurricane numbers and the solid grey line shows the simulated landfalling hurricane numbers.
We test predictions of landfalling hurricane numbers using the direct method as follows:

• we loop through the 10,000 sets of simulated landfalling hurricanes

• for each set, we miss out one of the 56 years

• using the other 55 years in that set, we build a linear regression model between SST and landfalling

hurricane numbers

given the SST for that year

• we then use that ﬁtted model to predict the number of landfalling hurricanes in the missed year,

• we calculate the error for that prediction

• we then repeat for all 10,000 sets (missing out a diﬀerent year each time)

• this gives us 10,000 prediction errors, from which we calculate the RMSE

We test the indirect method in almost exactly the same way, except that this time we also ﬁt a model
for predicting landfalling numbers from basin numbers.

2.4 Comparing the predictions

We compare these predictions in two ways:

• First, we compare the two RMSE values

• Second, we count what proportion of the time the errors from the direct method are smaller than

the errors from the indirect method

We also repeat the entire calculation a number of times as a rough way to evaluate the convergence of
our results.

3 Results

The RMSE for the direct method is 1.61 hurricanes, while the RMSE for the indirect method is 1.58
hurricanes. This diﬀerence is small, but the sign of it does appear to be real: when we repeat the whole
experiment a number of times, we always ﬁnd that the indirect method beats the direct method.
The indirect method beats the direct method 51.8% of the time.
Given the design of the experiment, these results tell us how the two methods perform, on average over
the whole range of SST values. Next year’s SST, however, is likely to be warm relative to historical SSTs.
We therefore consider the more speciﬁc question of how the methods are likely to perform for given warm
SSTs. Based on Laepple et al. (2006), we ﬁt a linear trend to the historical SSTs, and extrapolate this
trend out to 2011. This then gives SST values that are warmer than anything experienced in history
(27.987oC to be precise). We then repeat the whole analysis for predictions for this warm SST only.
The results are more or less as before: the indirect method still wins, only this time by a slightly larger
margin. The ratio of RMSE scores (direct divided by indirect) increases from 1.02 to 1.04.

4 Conclusions

We have compared the likely performance of direct and indirect methods for predicting landfalling hurri-
cane numbers from SST using simulated data. The direct method is based on building a linear regression
model directly from SST to landfalling hurricane numbers. The indirect method is based on building a
regression model from SST to basin numbers, and then predicting landfalling numbers from basin num-
bers using a constant proportion. We ﬁnd that the indirect method is better than the direct method, but
that the diﬀerence is very small.
Which method should we then use in practice? If we had to chose one method, our results seem to imply
that we should choose the indirect method, since it is slightly more accurate. The results are, however,
very close, and given the possibility to use two methods, we would use both, as alterative points of view.

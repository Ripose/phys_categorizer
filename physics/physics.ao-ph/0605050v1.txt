ABSTRACT

Humidity and C2
n data collected from the Chesapeake Bay area during the 2003/2004 period have been analyzed.
We demonstrate that there is an unequivocal correlation between the data during the same time periods, in the
absence of solar insolation. This correlation manifests itself as an inverse relationship. We suggest that C2
n in
the infrared region is also function of humidity, in addition to temperature and pressure.

Keywords: Strength of turbulence, humidity, scintillation

1. INTRODUCTION
It has been known for some time1 that the scintillation behaviour of point sources is a measure of the optical
seeing in the atmosphere. What has been less well understood is the contribution of diﬀerent environmental
variables to optical seeing. Over the past decade, a great deal of study has been dedicated to clarifying this
issue.

Comprehensive treatments of the theory of wave propagation in random media are given in Tatarskii’s
seminal works.2, 3 More recent developments are described in Tatarskii et al..4 Some of the simplest models
based on these complex works are well known and available in the literature: Greenwood,5 Hufnagel–Valley,6
SLC-Day and SLC-Night.7 These models are used to predict the strength of weak clear air turbulence’s
refractive index structure function, C2
n, but in all cases they have major failings: either they are too general
and do not take into account local geography and environment (as in the former two) or they are too speciﬁc
to a site (as in the latter two, which reference the median values above Mt. Haleakala in Maui, Hawaii).

A more recent numerical model known as PAMELA does attempt to account for geographical position and
ambient climate factors. However, its inverse power windspeed term fails to explain some of the characteristics
of C2
n during low wind conditions. It does an adequate job for characterizing horizontal and diagonal beam
propagation within the atmospheric boundary layer.8

Despite the diﬀerences, the models agree in terms of the overall general behaviour of C2

n. For example, it
is to be expected that during the daylight hours, the C2
n trend will be dominated by the solar insolation and
in those models that do account for day/night diﬀerences this is presented. The physical eﬀect is evidenced
in Oh,9 where in many cases scintillometer measurements are seen to strongly follow the measured solar
insolation function. When the sun sets however, it is less clear as to the predominant contributing factors. In
an extension of earlier work, Oh presented indications of a possible anticorrelation eﬀect between the ambient
relative humidity and the value of C2
n.

In this paper, we report on further analysis of the datasets obtained during that study to show that there

is an unequivocal correlation in the absence of solar insolation in a littoral space.

2. INSTRUMENTS AND ALGORITHMS

The C2
Chesapeake Bay Detachment (CBD) of the Naval Research Laboratory.

n and associated weather variable data was collected over a number of days during 2003 and 2004 at the

The C2

n data was obtained with a commercially available scintillometer (model LOA-004) from Optical
Scientiﬁc Inc, which serves as both a scintillometer and as an optical anemometer for winds transverse to the
beam paths. The local weather parameters were determined by a Davis Provantage Plus (DP+) weather station.
The LOA-004 had a sample rate of 10 seconds, while the DP+ was set at 5 minutes.

The LOA-004 instrument comprises of a single modulated infrared transmitter whose output is detected by
two single pixel detectors. For these data, the separation between transmitter and receiver was 100-m. The path
integrated C2
n measurements are determined by the LOA instrument by computation from the log–amplitude
scintillation (Cχ(r)) of the two receiving signals.10, 11 The algorithm for relating Cχ(r) to C2
n is based on an
equation for the log–amplitude covariance function in Kolmogorov turbulence by Cliﬀord et al.,12 which we
repeat here

Some comments are necessary at this point. The key assumptions made by the LOA-004 instrument in

computing C2

n are:

•

•

The turbulent power spectrum is Kolmogorov; the spatial power spectrum of temperature ﬂuctuations
H (k) are proportional to k−5/3. This may not always be true,
Φ2
especially if the inner and outer scales are on the order of the relevant dimensions of the observing system.

T (k) and the humidity ﬂuctuations Φ2

As a result of the previous assumption, the index of refraction structure function is assumed to be depen-
dent only on the temperature structure function and pressure at optical frequencies.

What we demonstrate in this paper is that the LOA-004 measured C2
n function from the CBD experiment is
indeed correlated with the humidity. The LOA-004’s design is by no means optimal for extracting C2
n, since
its main purpose is to act as an anemometer. To that end we have an eﬀort to evaluate contributions to the
measurement error of C2
n.

3. ANALYSIS

The C2
n data was smoothed with a 60 point rolling average function. The eﬀect of solar insolation was excluded
from this study. We deﬁned the morning and night portions of a 24 hour period as shown in Figure (1). Morning
runs from midnight until sunrise (as corroborated by a solar irradiance measurement), while night runs from
sunset to 23:59. As reported in Oh et al.9 visual inspection of the valid time series data gives the impression
that there is an approximate inverse relationship between C2
n and humidity. This can be appreciated in a more
quantitative manner by graphing C2

n against humidity.

We chose data sets in which the temperature variations are no more than

15% and the pressure change is
at most 15 mbars over the time intervals of interest. The data sections were also selected to have no scattering
20◦, inﬂowing from the bay
eﬀects due to snow or rain, and the wind was northerly (to within approximately
to land).

±

±

Given the aforementioned conditions, from the data available only a subset provided complete time series in
both ambient weather variables and C2
n. We were able to extract eight morning and evening runs, spanning seven
days between November 2003 and March 2004 for the purpose of calculating the crosscorrelation, ΓUV (t + δt) =
v), between humidity and C2
E[u(t + δt)v(t)], and cross covariance, CUV (t + δt) = E(u(t + δt)
n
measureables. In these parameters, E represents expected value and u, v are the mean values of the two random
processes, considered stationary.

As can be seen from Figures (2 - 9), the C2

n against humidity correlograms all evidence a negative gradient.
The tightness of the correlation is better examined in terms of the cross covariance. The results are normalized
such that the value at zero time lag was unity for identically varying data.

3.1. Comments on Figures (2 - 9)

cross covariance lacks symmetry.

Fig.(2) The correlogram shows an approximately even dispersion along the length of the best ﬁt trendline. The

Fig.(3) The correlogram shows the tightest correlation between the data series of all the plots and the cross

covariance is quite symmetric, although highly structured.

Fig.(4) The correlogram is fairly even, with some larger dispersion possibly occuring around 70% of humidity.

The cross covariance is symmetric.

Figure 10. Cross covariance at zero lag. The data set numbers are deﬁned in Table (1).

Fig.(5) The correlogram is evenly dispersed and the cross covariance is symmetric although spread.

Fig.(6) A greater dispersion is seen between 72% and 74% humidity than along the rest of the trendline, although
in terms of magnitude it is not very large. The cross correlation is highly asymmetric with the minimum
oﬀset from the zero lag position.

Fig.(7) A greater dispersion is seen below 67% humidity than along the rest of the trendline (again the magnitude

is not larger than the other plots).

Fig.(8) A large cluster of weakly correlated points are seen below 77% humidity. The cross covariance minimum

is oﬀset from the zero lag position but is otherwise reasonably symmetric.

Fig.(9) The correlogram shows a reasonably good correlation between the data series, although the cross covariance

shows less symmetry than might be expected from the correlogram.

3.2. Covariance at zero lag, CU V (δt = 0)
The CUV at zero lag (i.e. when both C2
n and humidity data sets are totally overlapping) are given in Figure
(10) and Table (1). The evidence for a negative correlation of humidity with C2
n is extremely strong; where
the minimum cross covariances are diﬀerent to the zero lag value, there is a time lag oﬀset of no more than 25
minutes (equal to 5 sample points). Some of the oﬀset error is possibly due to a timing mismatch between the
clocks used for the DP+ and the LOA-004 instruments; even without accounting for this, the CUV (δt = 0) is
still strongly negative.

The cross covariance method has provided unequivocal measures that the humidity and C2

n functions are

negatively correlated.

Using empirical data, we have conclusively demonstrated that a strong negative correlation exists between
the humidity and C2
n readings from experimental runs at the Naval Research Laboratory’s Chesapeake Bay
Detachment, for path lengths of about 100-m with relatively constant pressure, temperature and windspeed.

measurements in the much less humid environment of New Mexico. With the availability of more data, we
will be able to ascertain in a quantitative fashion the humidity contribution to C2

deeper understanding of C2
n will be found from analysis of the complete data obtained under these extrememly
varied ambient conditions.

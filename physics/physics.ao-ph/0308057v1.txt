A New Framework for the Assessment and Calibration of
Medium Range Ensemble Temperature Forecasts

Abstract

We present a new framework for the assessment and calibration of medium range ensemble tem-
perature forecasts. The method is based on maximising the likelihood of a simple parametric model
for the temperature distribution, and leads to some new insights into the predictability of uncertainty.

1 Introduction

A number of diﬀerent methods have been used for the assessment and calibration of ensemble forecasts
(for example see Atger (1999), Richardson (2000), Roulston and Smith (2002) and Wilson et al. (1999)).
In many applications of ensemble forecasts the forecast is used to derive the probability of a certain
outcome, such as temperature dropping below zero. In this context, the reliability diagram is an appro-
priate method for assessing reliability (see Anderson (1996), Eckel and Walters (1998), Talagrand et al.
(1997) and Hamill (1997)) and the relative operating characteristic (ROC) (Mason (1982), Swets (1988),
Mason and Graham (1999)) is an appropriate method to evaluate the resolution.
In other applications of ensemble forecasts, however, the forecast is interpreted as providing a mean
and a distribution of future values of temperature. For example in the ﬁeld of weather derivatives the
calculation of the fair strike for a certain class of weather swap contract1 needs an estimate of the mean of
the future temperatures, while the calculation of the fair premium for weather option contracts needs an
estimate of the whole distribution of future temperatures (see Jewson and Caballero (2002) for details).
Additionally, the assumption is often made that temperature is normally distributed since this allows the
temperature forecast to be summarised succinctly using just the mean and the standard deviation. For
such mean-and-distribution or mean-and-standard deviation based applications of ensemble forecasts the
reliability diagram and the ROC are not particularly appropriate.
In this paper we present a new framework for the assessment and calibration of ensemble temperature
forecasts based on analysis of the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of temperatures. The
method has been developed to respond to the need for a simple and practical method for assessment and
calibration that can be used by companies that make use of ensemble forecasts in the weather derivative
market. We postulate a parametric model for the mean and standard deviation and ﬁt the parameters
of the model using the maximum likelihood method. This approach has a number of advantages relative
to the assessment and calibration methods mentioned above. The model is simple, easy to interpret,
and the entire ensemble distribution can be calibrated in one simple step. Also the model gives a clear
indication of how many days of useful information there are in a forecast.
In section 2 we describe the data sets we use for this study. In section 3 we describe the statistical model
that forms the basis for the method we propose. In section 4 we describe the results from ﬁtting the
model. In section 5 we discuss extensions to other distributions and in section 6 we summarise our results
and draw some conclusions.

2 Data

We will base our analyses on one year of ensemble forecast data for the weather station at London’s
Heathrow airport, WMO number 03772. The forecasts are predictions of the daily average temperature,

and the target days of the forecasts run from 1st January 2002 to 31st December 2002. The forecast was
produced from the ECMWF model (Molteni et al., 1996) and downscaled to the airport location using
a simple interpolation routine prior to our analysis. There are 51 members in the ensemble. We will
compare these forecasts to the quality controlled climate values of daily average temperature for the same
location as reported by the UKMO.
Throughout this paper all equations and all values have had both the seasonal mean and the seasonal
standard deviation removed. Removing the seasonal standard deviation removes most of the seasonality
in the forecast error statistics, and justiﬁes the use of non-seasonal parameters in the statistical models
for temperature that we propose.

3 The Moment-based Ensemble Assessment and Calibration Model

For forecasts of temperature anomalies, it has long been recognized (see for example Leith (1974)) that
the use of a ﬁnal regression step between ensemble mean and observations can eliminate bias and minimise
the mean square error (MSE). For our purposes we will write this regression step as:

Ti ∼ N (α + βmi, σ)

(1)

where Ti is the observed temperature on day i, N (µ, σ) represents a normal distribution with mean µ
and standard deviation σ, mi is the forecast of the temperature (in our case, the ensemble mean) and α,
β and σ are free parameters. This regression model postulates that temperatures come from a normal
distribution with mean given by µi = α + βmi and standard deviation given by σ. The values for α, β
and σ come from ﬁtting the model, and this is usually done using least squares linear regression. One
justiﬁcation for the use of least squares linear regression is that for this particular model it is equivalent to
ﬁnding the parameters that maximize the likelihood of the data given the model (see Press et al. (1992)),
as long as we assume that the forecast errors are uncorrelated in time. We note that although the model
in equation 1 postulates that the data come from a normal distribution, it can be applied in situations
in which the data is not strictly normal, and in fact it is common (although perhaps bad) practice not
to test for normality when doing such linear regressions.
One of the assumptions in this model is that the standard deviation of the forecast errors σ is constant.
However it is well documented that the size of forecast errors varies in time (Palmer and Tibaldi, 1988)
and that there is a relationship between the ensemble spread and the size of forecast errors (Toth et al.,
2000). It thus makes sense to attempt to generalize the model in equation 1 to a model that takes these
temporal variations in σ into account. We will do this using the model:

Ti ∼ N (α + βmi, γ + δsi)

(2)

where the free parameter σ has been replaced by a linear function of the ensemble spread si, and two new
parameters γ and δ have been introduced. Modelling the standard deviation as a linear function of the
ensemble spread in this way allows for both time variation and the correction of biases in the predicted
uncertainty.2
The optimum parameters for this model can no longer be ﬁtted using least squares linear regression.
However, they can be ﬁtted if we can identify a cost function that can be minimised or maximised by
varying the parameters. There are various possibilities for such a cost function, but one of the most natural
is the likelihood, deﬁned as the probability density of the observations given the calibrated forecast.
Maximising the likelihood is the standard way to ﬁt parameters in statistics (see for instance textbooks
such as Casella and Berger (2002) or Lehmann and Casella (1998)), and gives the most accurate possible
estimates of the parameters for most statistical models.
As with the linear regression model, this model is also not restricted to cases in which temperature is
exactly normally distributed: the assumption of the normal distribution merely provides a metric in
which the likelihood can be calculated and the parameters ﬁtted. This metric is most appropriate when
the data is at least close to normally distributed. For cases when the data is not close to normal other
distributions can be used, or the data can be transformed to normal.
There are a number of useful features of the model we present. These include:

• Once the parameters have been ﬁtted to past historical data, calibration of future ensemble forecasts
is easy since it just involves applying linear transformations to the ensemble mean and standard
deviation. The calibrated values for the mean and the standard deviation can be used to deﬁne the

whole forecast distribution, or can be used to shift and stretch the individual ensemble members,
In the latter case non-normality in the
if individual ensemble members need to be preserved.
distribution of the original ensemble members will not be destroyed.

• The optimum values of the parameters in equation 2 have clear interpretation and give us useful
information about the performance of the ensemble. For instance α identiﬁes a bias in the mean, and
β represents a scaling of the forecast towards climatological values. In a perfect forecast, α would
be zero and β would be one. The spread parameters γ and δ combine to optimize the prediction
of uncertainty about the mean. The value of the ensemble spread s varies in time because of the
dependence of the growth rate of diﬀerences between ensemble members on the actual model state.
The calibrated standard deviation value σi = γ + δsi additionally includes uncertainty due to model
error. If the spread of the ensemble contains very little real information, δ will tend to be small,
and γ will tend to be large to compensate.

• It is very easy to calculate approximate uncertainty levels on the values of the parameters as part
of the ﬁtting procedure. This is done using the curvature of the log-likelihood at the maximum
(see the above references on likelihood methods). These uncertainty levels give us a clear answer to
the question of whether the ensemble forecast has useful skill at diﬀerent lead times. For instance,
once β is not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero we can say that the ensemble mean no longer contains
useful information (at least not within this framework) and once δ is not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from
zero then we can say that the ensemble spread no longer contains useful information. This raises
the interesting possibility that we might identify situations in which the mean may contain more
days of useful information than the spread.

• It is often necessary to decide which of two forecasts is the more accurate. If two forecasts are both
calibrated using equation 2 then the log-likelihood provides a natural way to compare the forecasts.
Log-likelihood measures the ability of the forecast to represent the whole distribution of observed
temperatures, and is a generalisation of mean square error. It can be presented in a number of ways
such as log-likelihood or log-likelihood skill score.

Forecasts calibrated using equation 2 will not necessarily minimise MSE. Users interested purely in a
single forecast that minimises MSE should thus calibrate using equation 1. However, users interested
in predictions of uncertainty, or, equivalently, in the whole distribution of possible temperatures, should
calibrate using equation 2. In practice we have found that the mean temperature prediction produced by
equation 2 is close to that produced by equation 1, presumably because the ﬂuctuations in uncertainty
are not large.

4 Results

The optimum values for the parameters in equation 2 for our 1 year of forecast data and observations are
shown in ﬁgure 1. In each case we show the approximate 95% sampling error conﬁdence intervals around
the optimum parameters. In some cases they are so narrow that they are hard to see in the graphs.
Looking at α we see that there is a small and roughly constant bias in the temperatures produced by
the ensemble. Correction of the ensemble mean (or each ensemble member) using α would eliminate this
bias, as long as the ensemble stays stationary.
The parameter β is slightly less than 1 at all leads. This shows that the ensemble mean varies too much:
either the ensemble mean, or each ensemble member, should be reduced by the factor β towards the
climatology. Such a damping factor is presumably required because the ensemble members are more
correlated with each other than they are with the observations and because the ensemble is ﬁnite in size.
Even at lead 10 β is highly signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero, implying that the ensemble mean still contains
useful predictive ability at that lead. If we allow ourselves to extrapolate the β curve to longer leads by
eye, it would seem likely that the ensemble mean would still contain useful predictive information even
beyond that.
The fact that our values of δ are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero out to the end of the forecast (just) shows
that there is signiﬁcant information in the ensemble spread too. However, in this case if we extrapolate
to higher lead times by eye it seems unlikely that there would be any more skill in δ. Since δ is below
one and γ is non-zero we see that the standard deviation of the ensemble is not an optimal estimate of
the uncertainty of the prediction.
The γ + δs transformation can change both the mean spread (the time mean of the standard deviation
across the ensemble) and the variability of that spread (the standard deviation in time of the standard

s

deviation across the ensemble). To measure the eﬀect on the mean spread, ﬁgure 2 shows values of γ+δs
(where the overbar indicates the mean in time over the year of data) which shows the factor by which
the transformation increases the mean spread. We see that at short lead times, the ensemble spread s
is far too small on average and the calibration increases the spread by factors of around 4 (at lead 0)
and 2 (at lead 1). At longer lead times the ensemble spread is still too small on average by a factor of
around 1.2. This underestimation of the spread from ensemble forecasts has been noted by a number of
authors such as Ziehmann (2000) and Mullen and Buizza (2000). It is likely to be due to model error in
the prediction model and due to the fact that the forecast is a prediction of a large scale ﬂow while the
observation is site-speciﬁc and hence aﬀected by small-scale variability not represented in the model.
The size of the eﬀect of the calibration on the variability (in time) of the spread is given by the value
of δ. Since δ is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from one at all lead times beyond the ﬁrst we conclude that the
variability of the spread from the ensemble needs to be reduced to be optimum at those lead times. This
could be because the variability of the ensemble spread is too large, or because the variability of the
ensemble spread is not highly correlated with the real variability of skill.
We can see from the values of δ that the variability of the ensemble spread alone will overestimate the
state-dependent predictability of this model by a large factor at long leads. A better estimate for the
level of state-dependent predictability is given by the variability of the calibrated spread, which is smaller
by the δ factor.
Figure 3 shows the ratio of the standard deviation of the ensemble spread to the mean ensemble spread
at diﬀerent lead times. We call this ratio the coeﬃcient of variation of the spread (COVS). Figure 3
shows the COVS estimated from both the uncalibrated and the calibrated ensemble data. These values
give an indication of how much extra information we get about the forecast uncertainty by using the
(uncalibrated or calibrated) spread of the ensemble rather than using a level of uncertainty which is
constant with time. The uncalibrated data suggests that variations in uncertainty that are 20% to 55%
of the mean uncertainty are predictable using the ensemble spread. However, because the uncalibrated
data both underestimates the total spread (the numerator in the COVS) and overestimates the predictable
part of the variability of the spread (the denominator in the COVS) these values seem to be overestimates.
The calibrated data suggests that variations in the uncertainty that are only 5% to 20% of the mean
uncertainty are predictable using the ensemble spread.

5 Other distributions

In cases where the forecast errors are not close to normally distributed, one can use other distributions.
For example in the case where the forecast errors show skew the skew-normal distribution SN can be
used. The skew-normal distribution is a generalisation of the normal distribution which has a third
parameter, and includes the possibility of modelling skew (Azzalini, 1985). Suppressing the index i for
clarity we then have:

T ∼ SN (α + βm, γ + δs, ζ + ηk)

(3)

where we have introduced the ensemble skew k and two new parameters ζ and η.
The skew-normal model can be ﬁtted using maximum likelihood methods exactly as for the normal
distribution. One of the results from such a ﬁtting process would be a clear indication as to whether the
forecast being calibrated does or does not contain statistically signiﬁcant information about the skew of
observed temperatures (this question has been discussed by Denholm-Price and Mylne (2002)).
For extremely non-normal distributions for which even the skew-normal is not non-normal enough, non-
parametric distributions may be more appropriate. A simple non-parametric method would be to use
a kernel density, with a single free parameter for the width of each kernel (see Bowman and Azzalini (1997)
for a description of kernel densities). Such a method would look a little like the method of Roulston and Smith
(2003) even though it is justiﬁed in a completely diﬀerent way.

6 Conclusions

We have described a simple parametric method for the assessment and calibration of ensemble tem-
perature forecasts. The method consists of applying linear transformations to the mean and standard
deviations from the ensemble. The parameters of the model can be ﬁtted easily using the maximum
likelihood method. The model has various advantages and disadvantages relative to other calibration
models currently in use. The main disadvantage is that the model only works for forecast errors that are

reasonably close to normally distributed, although extensions have been described that should overcome
that limitation. The advantages of the model are that:

• the calibration of forecasts using the model is extremely simple

• the model is transparent and easy to understand

• the model separates skill in predictions of the mean and the spread

• calculating conﬁdence intervals on parameters is easy

• the model gives a clear indication of how many days of useful skill there are in a forecast

We have applied the model to one year of site-speciﬁc ECMWF ensemble forecasts. We ﬁnd that the
forecasts have highly signiﬁcant skill for predicting both the mean and the standard deviation out to 10
days. The forecasts underestimate the mean uncertainty, as has been reported in other studies. They
also over-estimate the variability of the uncertainty. For these forecasts we estimate that the predictable
part of the uncertainty is only between 5% and 20% of the mean uncertainty, depending on lead time.
For some applications this variability in the uncertainty may be small enough that it can be ignored and
one could make the simplifying assumption that the uncertainty is constant in time.
Further work includes:

• Developing algorithms that avoid having to make the assumption that the forecast error is uncor-

related in time.

• Out of sample testing of the calibrated forecasts, using both measures from within the framework
(i.e. likelihood) and also other measures such as rank histograms, reliability diagrams and ROCs.

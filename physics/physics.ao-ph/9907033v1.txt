A possible explanation for Earth’s climatic changes in the past
few million years

W. W¨olﬂi ∗ and W. Baltensperger †

February 15, 2014

Abstract

The astronomical theory of Milankovitch relates the
changes of Earth’s past climate to variations in in-
solation caused by oscillations of the orbital param-
eters. However, this theory causes serious problems
if used to account for some major observed phenom-
ena of the past few million years. Here, we present
an alternative explanation for these phenomena. It
is based on the idea that the solar system until quite
recently contained an additional massive object of
planetary size. This object, called Z, is assumed
to have moved on a highly eccentric orbit bound
to the sun. It inﬂuenced Earth’s climate through
a gas cloud of evaporated material. Calculations
show that more than once during the last 3.2 Myr
it even approached the Earth close enough to pro-
voke a signiﬁcant shift of the geographic position of
the poles. The last of these shifts terminated the
Earth’s Ice Age epoch. The origin and fate of Z is
also discussed.

1 The problem of Earth’s past

climate changes

Ancient climate is recorded in deep sea sediments,
polar ice and some other natural archives mainly
through changes in the oxygen isotope ratio, the
δ18O. In deep sea sediments the δ18O-signal reﬂects
the combined eﬀect of water temperature and of the
amount of ice on Earth, whereas in polar ice it is
a reliable proxy for the ambient local surface air
temperature at the time of freezing. The study of
palaeontology and isotopic composition of hundreds
of drilling cores extracted from these archives dur-
ing the last few decades conﬁrm that Earth’s past
climate changed between colder and warmer phases,
known as the glacial-interglacial cycles. Spectral
analysis of this kind of proxy data covering the Late
Pleistocene have yielded periodicities which agree
more or less with those of Earth’s main orbital pa-
rameters, i.e. precession (23 kyr), obliquity (41 kyr)
and eccentricity (100 kyr), which appear at ﬁrst

sight to support the old idea of Milankovich [1], that
Earth’s climate reﬂects the variation in insolation
(solar heating) caused by the combined eﬀect of the
variation of these parameters [2, 3]. However, this
astronomical theory of climate has several short-
comings. In particular, the main glacial-interglacial
transitions occurred approximately every 100 kyr.
This feature contradicts the astronomical calcula-
tions which show that the modulation of the insola-
tion due to the eccentricity oscillation is negligibly
small compared to that of the two other orbital pa-
rameters. Many hypotheses have been formulated
to explain this “100 kyr problem”, sometimes in-
volving additional astronomical parameters, such as
the oscillation of the inclination of Earth’s orbital
plane, whose periodicity equals that of the eccen-
tricity [4, 5]. Most of the more recent attempts
to understand this problem rely either on a non-
linear response of the ice-sheet dynamics [6], or of
that of the coupled Atmosphere-Ocean system to
the astronomical insolation forcing [7]. Although
the results of some of these models compare well
with the time spectra of the climate record, up
to now none of them could reproduce the ampli-
tude and phase of each glacial cycle. For instance,
one of the most prominent interglacial periods of
warmings observed around 400 kyr ago, known as
the “isotope stage 11”- problem, happened at the
time when the solar insolation was smaller than dur-
ing the glacial times prior to and after this period.
More recent measurements with improved time res-
olutions, on deep sea sediment [8, 9] and polar ice
cores, GRIP [10], GISP2 [11] and Vostok [12] re-
vealed some additional and most puzzling features
of past climate. Fig. 1 shows the well known δ18O-
record of the GRIP ice core covering the last 130 kyr
of Earth’s climate history, including the last inter-
stadial, the Eem, the last glacial maximum around
about 18–20 kyr BP, and its abrupt termination
at about 11.5 kyr ago. Although some discrepan-
cies between the GRIP and GISP2 data older than
about 100 kyr BP have been noted [11], it is evi-
dent, that Earth’s climate changed rapidly during
the last Ice Age period. These temperature peaks,
called Dansgaard-Oeschger events, cannot be ex-
plained in terms of the Milankovitch eﬀects, since
they are too fast in comparison with the orbital pa-
rameters induced solar insolation variations. Even
more puzzling is the fast termination of the last
Ice Age period, the Pleistocene-Holocene transition,
shown in the lower part of Fig. 1. This transition
ended the Pleistocene, and the following Holocene
is a period of warmer temperature and generally
more stable climate. It has been demonstrated that

the climatic system in the Northern hemisphere is
capable to switch rapidly from one given state to
another [13]. But again, if for the same reason as
mentioned above the Milankovitch eﬀect cannot be
the cause of such a switch, what else could it be?
Is it possible that the luminosity of the sun varied
in accordance with these observations? This is very
unlikely, because prior to the Ice Age epoch, i.e.
during the Late Pliocene until about 3.3 Myr ago,
the climate was mild, stable for millions of years,
and very similar to what it has been since the be-
ginning of the Holocene [9]. Why should the irra-
diance of the sun suddenly get noisier for a limited
time? The Milankovitch eﬀect and small changes
of the solar irradiance are of relevance for Earth’s
climate. However, we agree with some of the critics
pointing out that both possibilities fail to explain
many properties of the observed past changes of cli-
mate and that new ideas are required to solve the
riddle of the Ice Age [4, 6].

In what follows we present such a new idea. First,
we show that the fast termination of the last Ice
Age period, the Pleistocene-Holocene transition,
can best be understood in terms of a rapid po-
lar wandering, as has been suggested (and refused)
more than 100 years ago. We then demonstrate
that such a shift can occur during a close encounter
between an object of planetary size and the Earth.
Assuming that this object, called Z, was on a highly
eccentric orbit bound to the sun, we ﬁnd that it
could be responsible for Earth’s climatic changes
over the last few million years. Z must have disap-
peared from the solar system some time after the
polar shift event, and we also consider the mecha-
nisms responsible for its disappearance.

2 Evidences for a polar shift
event at the end of the last
Ice Age period

The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) around 18–20
kyr BP is characterized by the lowest known tem-
perature in Earth’s history, low precipitation rates,
reduced sea level of at least 120 Meter [14], and huge
polar ice shields extending over the northern part of
America down to a latitude of almost 40◦ N during
the last glacial maximum (Wisconsin stage), and
in Europe to about 50◦ N, known as Weichsel and
W¨urm stages in its northern part and in the Alps,
It is also well documented that
respectively [15].

Rhinos and many other species of mammals roamed
in north-eastern Siberia and north-western Alaska

Interstadial, the Eemian, the last glacial period (ca. 90 – 11.5 kyrs) which is characterized by transient
and fast temperature variations (21 Dansgaard-Oeschger events), and the Holocene reﬂecting the sudden
improvement of Earth’s climate at about 11.5 kyrs ago. The lower part is an expanded view of the same
record for the last 20 kyrs. It shows the time structure of the Dansgaard-Oeschger event No.1 and the

[16]. Remains of these animals have been found on
the New Siberian Islands as far as 76◦ North in-
dicating that food was available to support these
largest mammals throughout the Late Pleistocene.
It has also been noted, that at the same time this
part of the world was covered by non-arctic forests
up to about the same latitude, e.g. more than 1000
km within present days’ arctic cycle (66,66◦). Even
more puzzling, however, is the evidence that at the
end of the last ice age, the so called Pleistocene-
Holocene transition, these animals were not only
instantaneously killed by some yet unknown cause,
but also immediately deep frozen together with the
surrounding mud [17]. The fact that the ﬂesh of
some of these animals was still eatable (for dogs) at
the time of their discovery about 200 years ago sug-
gests temperatures below freezing point through-
out the Holocene in this part of the world. This is
in contrast to the general warming up observed in
many other places on Earth including both polar
regions. The observation of simultaneous mass ex-
tinctions of small and large animals in the western
part of Alaska, in Western Europe and North Amer-
ica [18, 19] and the distinct sea level rise leave no
doubt that the observed fast rise in temperature at
the end of the last ice age period was accompanied
by a global cataclysm and a rapid reorganization of
the global climate.

During the LGM the northern polar ice cap was
not centered at the position of the (present day)
north pole, but displaced by about 18–20 degree
southwards on the American side of the globe [15].
This introduced the possibility of a rapid polar wan-
dering, i.e. a change in orientation of the Earth
with respect to its rotation axis. This idea was
considered in detail more than 100 years ago by
the most eminent scientists of that time such as
G.H. Darwin, J.C. Maxwell, G.V. Schiaparelli, W.
Thomson and many others. They concluded that
such a turn of the globe changing the geographi-
cal position of the North Pole to the amount re-
quired by the observations is in principle possi-
ble, but would require a force suﬃcient to over-
come the stabilizing eﬀect of the equatorial bulge
of our planet, which acts like the rim of a gyro-
scope. Since they were unable to ﬁnd any terres-
trial or extraterrestrial mechanism that could give
rise to such a force, this idea was ﬁnally dismissed
as impossible and, in fact, “not worth discussing”
[20]. Only more recently was this verdict seriously
questioned when the evidence from rock magnetism
studies unmistakably suggested that the wandering
of the geographic poles was more rule than excep-
tion in Earth’s history [21]. However, this wander-

ing is a slow process, probably connected to the con-
tinental drifts ﬁrst predicted by Wegener [22], and
therefore it cannot explain the rapid termination
of the last ice age. In view of this dilemma, Hap-
good [20] suggested an alternative possibility based
on the idea that the observed changes reﬂect the
occasional sliding of the whole rigid crust over the
viscous, plastic or possibly ﬂuid inner layers of our
Earth. He showed that the mass of the Antarctic ice
cap is not symmetrically distributed about the rota-
tion axis and believed that the resulting centrifugal
eﬀect is suﬃciently large to initiate such a slippage,
provided the ice cap can re-grow large enough after
each slide. In his foreword to Hapgood’s book, A.
Einstein cautiously commented this idea as follows:
“The only doubtful assumption is that the Earth’s
crust can be moved easily enough over the inner
layers”. This is indeed the crucial point of this idea
which eventually has not been accepted.

Was this the end of the polar shift debate, al-
though a fast polar shift is still the most straight-
forward explanation for all observed eﬀects con-
nected with the fast termination of the last Ice
Age period? In further investigating this question,
we found that one particular excitation mechanism,
namely the deformation of the Earth in a transient
external gravitational ﬁeld gradient, can produce
the required eﬀect.

3 The excitation of a polar
shift during a close ﬂyby of
a massive object

Any redistribution of Earth’s mass is accompanied
by a wobble and turn of the entire Earth relative
to its rotation axis. This movement depends on
both the initial mass redistribution and the rate
at which the Earth’s rotational bulge can readjust
to the changing position of the rotation axis on
the globe. Generally, the polar wandering result-
ing from Earth-bound causes are either too slow
(drift of the continental plates), or too small (storm,
ocean currents), to produce the rapid and large shift
required to explain the fast termination of the last
ice age period. But what about cosmic events?
There are two possibilities worthwhile to be con-
sidered: A collision of an object with the Earth,
and a close ﬂyby of an object. The ﬁrst case has
previously been discussed in the Literature [23]. It
can be dismissed, because an impact, capable to
signiﬁcantly alter Earth’s angular momentum or its
moment of inertia, would have left one or several
craters and other distinct geophysical and chemical

4

signatures, which would have been discovered by
geologists, bearing in mind that the event we are
discussing occurred only 11.5 kyr ago. We there-
fore consider the possibility that the Earth had a
close encounter with a massive object. We estimate
ﬁrst the minimum amount of deformation required
to cause a polar wandering of about 18◦, as is men-
tioned in chapter 2. We then show that such a shift
can be induced by an object of planetary size dur-
ing a ﬂyby and that it is fast enough to explain the
rapid termination of the last Ice Age epoch.

3.1 Earth’s deformation in a strong
gravitational ﬁeld gradient

Prior to any disturbance the rotating Earth is to a
large extent in a hydrostatic equilibrium. The mo-
ment of inertia is a symmetric tensor Ξ which con-
nects the vectors of angular velocity ~ω and angular
momentum ~D by the equation ~D = Ξ~ω. For the
undisturbed Earth the diagonalized tensor has the
elements Ξ[1, 1] ≡ A = Ξ[2, 2] ≡ B = 8.010247·1037
kg m2 and Ξ[3, 3] ≡ C = 8.036559 · 1037 kg m2 [24].
The ratio C/A = 1.0032847 shows that the equa-
torial bulge contributes about 3.3 %0 to the main
principal moment of inertia; the radius at the equa-
tor exceeds that at the poles by about 21 km. This
equatorial bulge stabilizes the position of the rota-
tion axis along the ﬁgure axis C. During the ﬂyby of
a massive object, the globe is transiently deformed
so that the new principal axis of the inertial tensor
Ξ — the ﬁgure axis — deviates from the rotation
axis. These axes then precess around each other,
whereby the angular momentum ~D remains ﬁxed
in space. For an observer on Earth the angular ve-
locity vector ~ω moves around the ﬁgure axis.
In
co-ordinates ﬁxed to the Earth this free motion is
described by the Euler equation

dΞ ~ω
dt

= [Ξ ~ω, ~ω]

(1)

where the square bracket represents the vector
product. According to Eq. 1 the precession fre-
quency of a rigid Earth would be ω0(C − A)/A,
with ω0, the angular velocity of Earth’s rotation.
This yields an “Euler period” of 305 d. A minute
precession of the rotation axis was observed by S.C.
Chandler more than 100 years ago, but its period
turned out to be 435 d [25]. Newcomb [26] showed
that this discrepancy can be understood by assum-
ing that the Earth is not rigid but can be plastically
deformed, which was quite a pioneering conclusion
in those days. Since then, this so called Chandler’s
free motion of the rotation axis has been studied in

great detail, but always in view of small deviations
only [27, 28]. The presently continuing Chandler
motion is still open to discussion [29].

A massive object passing the Earth at a close
distance deforms it with a time dependent tidal
force, which is the diﬀerence between the gravita-
tional force at the given point and that acting at
the Earth’s center. When the distance R between
the centers of the two masses is large compared to
the radius RE of the Earth, the tidal force ~F (z) is
parallel to the z-direction which points to the per-
turbing mass MZ. It has the value

F (z) = 2MZGz/R

3

(2)

where G = 6.673 · 10−11 m3kg−1s−2 is the gravita-
tional constant. On Earth’s surface z = RE cos γ,
where the angle γ is the latitude. This tidal force in-
creases as the third reciprocal power of the distance
R between the center of the perturbing mass and
that of the Earth. For example, if the moon would
be 10 times closer to the Earth, then its tidal force
would be 1000 times larger than it is at present.

In ﬁrst order approximation, this force tends to
give the Earth an ellipsoidal shape. Such a defor-
mation is possible because Earth’s interior is liquid
or plastic except for the inner core and the periph-
eral crust [24]. We estimate the deformation due to
the force, Eq. 2, in a static approach by minimizing
the energy as a function of the deformation in the
external ﬁeld. For this we assume that the redis-
tribution of material at the surface of the Earth is
given by

H(γ) = H0(cos(2γ) + 1/3)

(3)

where H0 is the amplitude of the tide. The energy
of the material in the deformed state minus that
prior to the deformation in the presence of the per-
turbation is then

which is minimized with

(5)

Here g = 9.8 m/s2 is the gravitational accelera-
tion at the surface of the Earth and ρ the speciﬁc
weight of the displaced material (3500 kg/m3 for the
Earth’s surface). Applying Eq. 5 to the Earth-Moon
system we ﬁnd that the peak-to-peak level diﬀer-
ence on Earth induced by our Moon is 2H0 = 0.35
m which agrees quite well with the recently evalu-
ated deformation of about 0.30 m [30]. We use this

5

formula to estimate the deformation produced by
a ﬂyby of a massive object, although we are aware
that this simple approach probably overestimates
the deformation remaining immediately after such
a ﬂyby. In particular, if the response to the strong
tidal force is too fast, then part of the deforma-
tion will quickly disappear when the force ceases.
We also expect that the actual deformation will not
be a linear function of the gravitational force, and
will depend on the relative motion of the perturbing
mass to the surface of the rotating Earth.

To estimate the minimum amplitude H0 of the
tidal bulge required to cause a polar wandering of
about 18◦, as explained in chapter 2, we added to
the equilibrium deformation of the Earth an addi-
tional mass distribution of the form of Eq. 3, which
was rotated by an angle α with respect to the orig-
inal ﬁgure axis. The diagonalization of the new in-
ertial tensors resulted in a new ﬁgure axis whose
tilting angle relative to the former axis depends on
H0 and α. Minimizing H0 as a function of α, we
ﬁnd that a tilting angle of 18◦ can be achieved with
a bulge amplitude of H0 = 6.45 km and an angle α
= 30◦. This result allows us to estimate the mass of
our ﬂyby-object or its distance of closest approach,
by means of Eq. 5 which ﬁxes MZ/R3. Assuming
for instance that the distance of closest approach
should be larger than the Roche limit, which for
our Earth is about Rl = 2.44RE or about 15’600
km (assuming equal density of both objects), then
the mass MZ must be larger than about 0.03 times
the mass of the Earth (ME), a value which is some-
what smaller than that of Mercury. On the other
hand, 2-body dynamics tells us that the mass has to
be much smaller than that of our Earth. Otherwise
Earth’s orbit, in particular its inclination and ec-
centricity, would have been altered during such an
event to an amount which would be incompatible
with the present orbital parameters of the Earth.
This consideration suggests an upper limit of about
MZ < 0.2ME, and, according to Eq. 5, a maximum
distance of closest approach of 29 300 km. Since our
static approximation most probably overestimates
the tidal eﬀects, we suspect that the mass of Z was
larger than 0.03 ME and that its closest approach
during this event was even within the Roche limit.

3.2 The fast polar wandering

The sudden deformation of the Earth resulting from
a short ﬂyby event (the excitation time is less than
10 h) deﬁnes the new ﬁgure axis around which the
rotation axis immediately starts to precess, as de-
scribed by Euler’s Eq. 1. Since the ﬁgure axis it-

self moves only by small amounts in co-ordinates
ﬁxed to the Earth, the rotation axis eﬀectively spi-
rals to the shifted position of the ﬁgure axis. To
demonstrate this polar wandering, we solved Eq. 1
numerically. Since the Earth is not a rigid body
we started the calculation with the inertial tensor,
as deﬁned by the initial deformation, and assumed
that it relaxes towards the equilibrium tensor Ξ0
oriented along the instantaneous rotation axis as

dΞ
dt

= −

Ξ(t) − Ξ0[~ω(t)]
τ

(6)

Thus we approximated the relaxation behavior by
a single relaxation time τ , which includes both the
capability of the equatorial bulge to follow the ro-
tation axis and the disappearance of the deforma-
tion responsible for the polar wandering. Assuming
a relaxation time of τ = 500 d, we ﬁnd that the
rotation axis moves into the new position with a
precession period of about 400 d. The ﬁnal desti-
nation is reached within about four precession peri-
ods or about 4.8 years (Fig. 2). This is certainly fast
enough to explain the rapid termination of the last
Ice Age period shown in the lower part of Fig. 1. We
have to add here, that the true relaxation behavior
of the Earth in the presence of a large, but short-
term deformation is still open to speculation. The
theoretical estimates for this relaxation time vary
between a few 10 d and 10 yr [31]. We ﬁnd that τ
in our example has to be larger than about 100 days
to achieve a polar shift of the required magnitude.

3.3 The impact of the polar shift

event on the climate

The lower part of Fig. 1 shows, that the termina-
tion of the last ice age period is characterized by
two events: A short term increase of temperature
around about 14.5 kyr. ago, which was followed by
a slow decrease back to the Ice Age level. The fol-
lowing cold period, known as Younger Dryas (YD),
lasted for about 800 years. At about 11.5 kyr ago
the temperature suddenly rose again, but, and in
contrast to the previous event, it continued to in-
crease slowly until about 9000 years ago. From then
on the surface temperature over Greenland essen-
tially remained at that high value up to the present
day. Can we understand why the ﬁrst temperature
increase was a transient episode only, whereas the
second event had such a long lasting eﬀect? To
answer the ﬁrst part of this question we need to
consider an additional property of our ﬂyby object,
which will be discussed in the next chapter. It is
suﬃcient to mention here that in this case the ﬂyby

distance of our object was simply too large to excite
a signiﬁcant polar wandering. The consequences of
the second event can be explained in terms of the
polar wandering discussed above. For this we have
to remember (see chapter 2) that the shape and ex-
tension of the ice shield in the Northern hemisphere
prior to the shift suggest a pole position at a lon-
gitude of about 90◦ W and a latitude of about 72◦
N, which is quite close to the present position of
the North magnetic pole. Identifying this position
with the starting point of our calculation presented
in Fig. 2, we see that the net eﬀect of this polar
wandering was a rotation of the globe by about
18◦. As a consequence, the latitudinal pattern of
the incident solar radiation immediately changed,
so that, e.g.
the low latitude part of the North
American and European ice shields rapidly melted
away, whereas in formerly ice free regions of the
Arctic Ocean permanent ice was formed. Similarly,
in the eastern part of the Antarctic the extent of
the ice shelf was reduced, and, as we suspect, the
formerly ice free western coast was covered to the
extend observed today. After a transition time of
about 2 000 years during which the polar ice sheets
adjusted to the new pole position, the new state of
the climate, called Holocene, was established. Com-
pared to the previous climate state, the Holocene is
signiﬁcantly warmer, essentially, because the North
pole moved away from the upper part of the North
American continent into the present position in the
Arctic Ocean. This resulted in an increased heat
exchange between ice and water, which signiﬁcantly
reduced the extent of the polar ice cap. The albedo

decreased accordingly. This reduction was only par-
tially compensated by the corresponding changes
in the southern hemisphere. According to this sce-
nario, the Holocene is a new stable epoch and not
just another Interstadial, as is generally believed,
because the new pole position is stable and Z no
longer inﬂuences the Earth.

4 Planet Z: a transient mem-
ber of the solar system

We have seen that an object of mass MZ between
0.03 ME and 0.2 ME can excite a polar shift which
is both fast and large enough to explain the termi-
nation of the last Ice Age, provided it passed the
Earth at a distance of less than about 30 000 km.
Since it is extremely unlikely that an object on a hy-
perbolic trajectory would accidentally approach the
Earth so close during one singular ﬂyby, we consider
the possibility that it was moving on a bound or-
bit extending beyond that of the Earth. The prob-
lem with this assumption is that this object, Z, no
longer exists — otherwise we would observe it — so
that the occurrence of the proposed close encounter
at a speciﬁc time cannot be veriﬁed by backward
calculations. Therefore, we shall consider the long
term behaviour of Z on the basis of assumed orbital
parameters in order to ﬁnd out whether close ap-
proaches to the Earth occur as often as expected.
We shall see that this “trial and error” approach not
only gives a positive answer, but even provides an
explanation for the frequent fast climatic changes

7

observed prior to the pole shift event (see chapter
5).

4.1 The orbit of planet Z and its
close encounters with the Earth

There are constraints on the initial orbital param-
eters of Z. Its aphelion has to be larger than that
of the Earth, otherwise it could not approach the
Earth close enough. We shall see further below that
at each perihelion passage a surface layer of Z has to
evaporate at suﬃciently high temperatures so that
atoms reach the escape velocity. This requires an
extremely eccentric orbit with a ≪ b, where a is the
perihelion and b the aphelion distance. Thus the
major semi-axis A = 1
2 b must be larger
than 0.5 AU, and the eccentricity ǫ = (1−a/A) close
to one. Expecting that the encounter frequency
rapidly decreases with increasing A, we restrict the
investigations, to the range 0.5 < A < 2 AU. There
are no restrictions on the inclination i of Z’s orbit,
so that the full range 0◦ < i < 180◦ has to be ex-
plored.

2 (a + b) ≈ 1

With this in mind, Nufer et al. [32] calculated
the movement of Z in the gravitational ﬁeld of the
sun, the Earth, the Moon and all other planets, ex-
cept Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, and evaluated by
means of a Pascal program its closest approaches
to the Earth for each orbital period. Details of this
program, its performance, and the relevant results
shall be published in [32].
In the simulations Z
was always added to the solar system at the year
J2000.0, ignoring the fact that at this time it no
longer existed. So far calculations have been per-
formed, forward as well as backwards in time, for
two diﬀerent masses (MZ = 0.11ME equal to that
of Mars, and MZ = 0.06ME) and seven diﬀerent
sets of initial orbital parameters (A = 0.978 and 2
AU, six diﬀerent inclinations in the range i = 0◦–
180◦ and two eccentricities ǫ = 0, 973 and 0.987)
The time ranges varied between 150 and 750 kyr.
As expected, we found that encounters are more fre-
quent for A = 0.978 than for A = 2. Their number
also increases with increasing eccentricity ǫ, and is
largest for small inclinations i < 6◦. The inclina-
tion is deﬁned here as the angle between Z’s orbital
plane and the invariable plane which is perpendic-
ular to the orbital angular momentum of the solar
system. The results obtained with the initial condi-
tions A = 0.978, ǫ = 0.973, i = 0◦ and 180◦, respec-
tively, are too similar to decide whether Z was on
a pro- or a retrograde orbit. Since the computing
speed strongly depends on the precision assumed for
the numerical integration procedure, we restricted

8

it to a moderate value of 10−13 per integration step,
which was suﬃcient for most considerations. With
this restriction, about 15 h were needed to cover 10
kyr using a 133 MHz PC.

The result of one of these calculations is dis-
played in Fig. 3.
It shows the closest approaches
of Z (MZ = 0.11ME) to the Earth over a time pe-
riod of 750 kyr. The initial parameters at J2000.0
were A = 0.978 AU, ǫ = 0.973 and i = 0◦. Plot-
ted are all encounters with distances of less than
0.02 AU = 3 · 106 km. The irregular clustering of
these approaches is the result of the osculating or-
bital parameters of Z and the Earth. An expanded
view of all closest approaches with distances less
than twice that of the Moon over 750 kyr is given
in Fig. 4. To illustrate the mass dependence we
also show the pattern obtained for an object with
MZ = 0.06ME, but otherwise identical orbital pa-
rameters. The two horizontal dashed lines in both
ﬁgures indicate Moon’s distance (384 000 km), and
the critical distance below which signiﬁcant polar

the ﬁrst case we note a closest approach of about
59 000 km, i.e. no pole shift event, but a distinct one
in the second case (23 500 km). ¿From these and
the other trials we conclude that an object moving
on a highly eccentric orbit approaches the Earth to
polar shift distance about once in 1 Million years,
which is compatible with the duration of the ice
age epoch (see chapter 6.1). It is meaningless that
the calculated polar shift event does not occur at
the expected time in view of the fact that the ex-
act mass and orbit of Z is unknown. In both cases
we also observe about 6 ﬂyby’s per 100 kyr below
In all these events the gravitational

interaction is still strong enough to excite strong
earthquakes and volcanic activities (see chapter 7).
All these close ﬂyby’s also inﬂuence Moon’s orbit.
We found, however, that the resulting disturbances
over the investigated time ranges are averaged to
the amount compatible with the present orbit [32].
The frequency of the ﬂyby’s increases with their dis-
tance. For distances larger than twice that of the
Moon they are harmless regarding tidal eﬀects in-
duced on Earth, but they can still inﬂuence Earth’s
climate. To understand this additional eﬀect, which
is further discussed in chapter 5, we next examine
what happened to Z on the proposed highly eccen-
tric orbit. For convenience, we assume that it was a
Mars sized object with MZ = 0.11ME = 6.58 · 1023
kg, and radius RZ = 3.39 · 106 m.

Figure 4: Closest approaches over 750 kyr below twice the Moon-Earth distance. The pattern depends
on the selected orbital parameters and the mass of the object. The left side shows the result obtained
for a mars-like object (MZ = 0.11ME), and the right side that for an object with MZ = 0.06ME but
otherwise identical start parameters. The two horizontal dashed lines in both ﬁgures indicate Moon’s
distance (384 000 km), and the critical distance below which signiﬁcant polar shifts have to be expected
(30 000 km), respectively. The open (ﬁlled) circles mark the encounters of the objects on their way
towards (from) the sun.

4.2 Solar radiation eﬀects: the gas

cloud

An object moving on a highly eccentric orbit is ex-
posed to intense solar radiation. The total amount
of energy EZs received by Z per unit of surface and
orbital period is

EZs = Ps

I

dt
4πR2 =

MZ

(7)

where Ps = 3.73·1026 J/s is the total power radiated
by the sun. The orbital angular momentum L =
MZR2 dϕ
(MZ: mass of Z, R its distance to the
dt
sun, and ϕ the angle co-ordinate) is determined by
the major semi-axis A and the eccentricity ǫ

L = MZ

MSGA(1 − ǫ2)

(8)

G is the gravitation constant, and MS the mass of
the sun. Therefore

p

EZs =

Ps
MSGA(1 − ǫ2)

(9)

Using the same orbital parameters as in Fig. 3
(A = 1 AU, ǫ = 0.973), this formula yields an en-
ergy per unit surface of 1.67 · 1011 J/m2 per orbit.

p

During each perihelion passage the power density
reaches a maximum of about 2.83 MW/m2. This
is suﬃcient to evaporate any type of rock on the
exposed side and also to heat up the resulting gas
so that its light components, mostly atoms, even
reach the escape velocity ve, which is 5020 m/s for
a mars-like object. If all the radiation energy were
converted into kinetic energy, then the total mass
per m2 being accelerated to escape velocity would
amount to

mg = 2

EZs

e

(10)

or mg = 13 300 kg/m2. This corresponds to an ab-
lation rate of almost 5 m per orbital period, assum-
ing that Z was composed of silicates with typical
density of about 2700 kg/m3. Since the conversion
eﬃciency was hardly 100% , this represents an up-
per limit for the total mass of evaporated material.
It amounts to Mg = πR2
Z mg = 4.8 · 105 Gt per or-
bital period, indicating that Z was surrounded by
a rapidly expanding gas cloud, with Silicon (atomic
weight 28) as its main component. Its radius at the
distance of of Earth’s orbit was Rg = τgvg, where τg
is the travelling time from the sun to Earth’s orbit,
and vg the expansion velocity of the gas cloud. The
temperature T of the atmosphere of Z from which

where MS is the solar mass, and R the distance
to the sun. During an orbit of Z twice this energy
is transformed into heat, i.e. 2|∆EZt| = 1 · 1025
Joule for R = a. Tidal forces act on the sun
as well. The corresponding values are 0.6 m and
−1 · 1023 Joule, respectively, smaller than the tidal
eﬀect on planet Z. Comparing ∆EZt with the in-
ﬂux of solar radiation which according to Eq. 9 is
EZsπR2
Z = 6.05 · 1024 Joule, we see that the values
are of the same order. Radiative energy primarily
heated up the surface, while the tidal deformation
extended into the interior of planet Z. Assuming
that all of this energy was converted into heat, then
the temperature increase was ∆T = 2 ∆EZt
= 0.02
CpMZ
K per orbit, assuming a speciﬁc heat of Cp = 650
J/kg K. After about one Million orbits, approxi-
mately equal to Earth years, the interior was melted
and, according to the Stefan-Boltzman T 4-law, tidal
energy alone could maintain a temperature of about
450 K on a black surface. This implies that the sur-
face was only molten during each perihelion pas-
sage, whereas on its journey towards the aphelion
a thin solid crust was formed on the surface. Once
liqueﬁed, Z easily reached its optimum shape dur-
ing each perihelion passage. This redistribution of
matter was a turbulent process and occurred twice
during each passage. For smaller perihelion dis-
tances tidal heating would dominate because of its
a−6 dependence per orbit as compared to the a−1/2
dependence of the radiation energy given by Eq. 9.

Tidal losses imply that the deformation lags be-
hind the exciting tidal ﬁeld, so that the forces on
Z are not symmetric on incoming and outgoing po-
sitions. As a consequence, both the orbital energy
E0 and the orbital angular momentum L decrease.
With decreasing E0 the major semi-axis A of the or-
bit is reduced. The eﬀect of the tidal energy dissipa-
tion can be estimated by comparing the maximum
tidal loss 2∆EZt with the orbital energy determined
2A = −2.65 · 1032 Joule. The ratio
by E0 = − MZ MS G
= 4.4 · 107 is a measure for the number of
E0
2∆EZt
orbits required for a substantial change of A. The
inﬂuence on the eccentricity ǫ is less evident. The
relation ǫ2 = 1 + 2E0L
S G2 shows that a decrease in
Z M 2
E0 lowers ǫ, while a decrease in L increases ǫ, since
E0 is negative. In view of our restricted knowledge
of Z, we are not able to state which of the two eﬀects
prevailed.

the fasted atoms escape equals the temperature of

, with kB the
pansion velocity is
Boltzmann constant, and ma the atomic mass of the
gas compound. For Si atoms this yields a velocity
of 940 m/s, assuming a temperature of T = 3000 K
during the perihelion passage. In τg = 34 days, the
travelling time of Z from the perihelion to Earth’s
orbit, the gas cloud expanded to a radius of 2.8
Mio. km. The cloud remained spherical during this
time, provided the constituents of the cloud have no
resonant transitions in the solar spectrum. In this
case, the Rayleigh scattering cross section is of the
order of the square of the classical electron radius,
so that less than one photon per atom was scattered
during the travelling time.
In this case the light
pressure eﬀect is negligibly small, and the scattered
light is dominantly blue in colour. This behaviour
diﬀers from that of an opaque grain which is ac-
celerated inversely proportional to its radius by the
light pressure. A particle of 1 micron is displaced
by many Mio. km during 34 d.

It is interesting to compare these considerations
with observations: For instance, the coma of the
comet observed in 1811 AD had a diameter of 1.8 ·
106 km [33], comparable to the estimate obtained
for Z. Its tail had a length of 179 · 106 km and was
“white” in colour suggesting that it contained dust
grains of various sizes and molecules with strong
transition in the solar spectrum. The appearance
of Z was diﬀerent. Its nucleus was much larger than
those of any presently known ordinary comets and it
was surrounded by a huge but essentially spherical
gas cloud with bluish colour.

4.3 Tidal eﬀects on Z

Z was also exposed to strong time dependent
gravitational forces during each perihelion passage.
They induced a tidal wave, whose kinetic energy
was converted into heat so that its temperature in-
creased stepwise. To get an idea of this heating
eﬀect, we estimate ﬁrst the amplitude of this tidal
wave. For this we use Eq. 5, but this time with
MZ for the solar mass, and RZ and gZ for the ra-
dius and surface acceleration of Z (MZ, RZ , and gZ
equal to that of Mars). For a perihelion distance
R = a = 4 · 109 m, as determined by the orbital pa-
rameters A = 1 AU and ǫ = 0.973, we ﬁnd a value of
H0 = 3230 m. The lowering of the energy through
the deformation in the tidal ﬁeld, given by Eqs. 5
and 4, expressed in variables for Z, is

5 The climate impact of the

gas cloud of planet Z

The upper panel of Fig. 3 indicates that Z fre-
quently approached the Earth to distances within
its surrounding gas cloud, which had a radius of
about 2.8 Mio. km, according to our estimate. We
shall show that the incidence of this gas on Earth’s
atmosphere resulted in a Greenhouse eﬀect which
was large enough to enhance the global tempera-
ture. Using a simple model for this Greenhouse
heating we further demonstrate that the frequency
structure of this eﬀect compares surprisingly well
with that of Dansgaard-Oeschger events observed
during the Late Pleistocene (Fig. 1).

5.1 A gas cloud driven Greenhouse

eﬀect

Each time the Earth passed through the gas cloud
of Z, a fraction of this material was captured by
Earth’s upper atmosphere. For a spherical gas
cloud, and constant gas density, the amount of gas
mc captured during one crossing is proportional to
the ratio of the volume covered by the Earth dur-
ing its passage, Vc ≤ πR2
E2Rg, and the volume of
the gas cloud Vg = 4πR3
g/3. Neglecting the gravi-
tational focusing, which enlarges the capture radius
Rc over Earth radius RE by at most 10 % , the total
mass of captured particles is determined by:

mc ≤ 1.5mgRE2/R2

g

(12)

With the estimated mass for the gas cloud mg =
its radius Rg = 2.8 · 106 km, and
4.8 · 105 Gt,
Earth’s radius RE = 6.4 · 103 km, this yields an
amount of mc ≤ 3.8 Gt per encounter. The atoms
of this cloud hit the upper atmosphere of the Earth
with a relative velocity of about vr = 42 km/s, as-
suming a crossing angle of 90◦ and equal velocities
of about 30 km/s for the Earth and Z. The par-
ticles are stopped at an altitude of about 150–200
km above Earth’s surface.
Including the acceler-
ation in the gravitational ﬁeld of the Earth (es-
cape velocity ves = 11 km/s), we ﬁnd that the
total energy deposited at this altitude amounts to
Eg = mc(v2
es)/2 = 3.65 · 1021 J. Since the pas-
sage through the cloud lasted up to 37 hours, this
energy was deposited into a thin layer of the upper-
most atmosphere of the whole globe.

r + v2

The impact of this cloud on Earth’s atmosphere
was manifold considering the fact that each par-
ticle had a kinetic energy of about 280 eV. This
energy was converted into radiation and used to
ionise and dissociate the main compounds of the

atmosphere, the Nitrogen and Oxygen molecules,
as well as tracer gases such as Ozone and water
vapour. The resulting ions and atoms initiated a
complex chain of chemical reactions in the upper
atmosphere during which the well known infrared-
active compounds, such as NO, NO2, N2O, NH3,
HNO3 and O3 were formed. It exceeds the scope
of this paper and is beyond the knowledge of both
authors to specify each relevant compound and to
quantify its amount. However, by means of the fol-
lowing simple arguments we can get some idea of the
total amount of infrared active molecules produced
during such an event. Assuming that 20 % of the
particle energy, or 56 eV, is consumed by dissocia-
tion, then about 20 N2 or O2 molecules are decom-
posed per incoming particle. The resulting 40 ex-
cited and ionised atoms interact with the molecules
of the atmosphere. Assuming that 50 % of these
atoms ends up in an infrared active molecule, then
about 20 of these would be produced per incoming
particle. Since their mean molecular weight is com-
parable with the atomic weight of Silicon, we expect
that up to 20 · 3.8 Gt = 76 Gt of Greenhouse gases,
mostly Nitrogen compounds and Ozone, could be
produced during a ﬂyby. True, this is less than
the atmospheric inventory of CO2 which was of the
order of 430 Gt during the last glacial maximum.
However, this deﬁcit is more than compensated by
the fact, that the radiative forcing of most of the
infrared active molecules of interest here is 30–70
times larger than that of CO2 for equal concen-
trations. We conclude that the estimated amount
of Greenhouse gases produced is suﬃcient to tran-
siently enhance the mean global temperature to a
level higher than what is predicted for a doubling
of the CO2 concentration [34]. The role of CO2
and CH4 during such an event is open to discus-
sion. According to the measurements made on air
trapped in the polar ice cores, their concentrations
essentially seems to follow the observed global tem-
perature changes [35], suggesting that they play a
passive role only.

5.2 The climate changes during the

Ice Age epoch

In chapter 3 we have explained why the climate was
generally colder during the Late Pleistocene than in
the following Holocene. Here, we show that the sud-
den increases in temperature of variable length and
frequency, the Dansgaard-Oeschger events shown in
Fig. 1, can be explained in terms of the Green-
house heating eﬀect discussed above. For this we
assume that the global temperature increase ∆T

12

is proportional to the Greenhouse gas concentra-
tion, and that this value depends linearly on the
number of particles captured during each encounter.
We further assume that the suddenly enhanced gas
concentrations decrease exponentially in time after

were Dj is the distance of closest approach of the
ﬂyby object at time tj, Rg the radius of the gas
cloud, and τr an averaged residence time of the rel-
evant Greenhouse gases. T0 is the initial tempera-
ture increase for Dj ≪ Rg, which depends on the
amount of material captured from the gas cloud,
the eﬃciency of conversion into Greenhouse gases,
and the radiative forcing of these. The value of T0 is
open to discussion. For the reasons explained above
we are optimistic that T0 is large enough to account
for the ∆T observed in the polar ice cores. We also
note that the residence times of the various Green-
house gases of interest here are not known. This
crude model ignores long term reactions of Earth’s
climate system to the sudden changes in the radia-
tion budget.

Applying Eq. 13 to the closest approach spec-
trum given in Fig. 3 yields the Greenhouse heat-
ing signal shown in Fig. 5. Outgoing and incoming
passages were equally weighted. Actually, incoming
gas clouds are more expanded so that a single pas-
sage contributes less. On the other hand they also
contribute for larger distances than those consid-
ered in Fig. 5. This calculation was performed with
a time constant of τr = 200 yr which we consider
an uppermost limit for the residence time of the
Greenhouse gases of interest here. Again, a one-to-
one correspondence between predicted and observed
temperature spikes and clusters of spikes cannot be
expected for the reason given in chapter 4. Nev-
ertheless, a comparison of the calculated spectrum
with the δ18O polar ice data displayed in Fig. 1 re-
veals striking similarities in shape, frequency and
irregular clustering. E.g. the spectrum in Fig. 6
(lower panel) exhibits 17–26 distinct temperature
excursions per 100 kyr, values, which compare well
with the 21 Dansgaard-Oeschger events observed in
the polar ice data (Fig. 1) and some other palaeo-
climate archives during the last glacial period, i.e.
90–11.5 kyr ago [8].

In order to determine the frequency spectrum of
the Greenhouse signal presented in Fig. 5, we ap-
plied the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) algo-
rithm to 219 data points of this spectrum, i.e. to

the time range from +150 to -374 kyr. The re-
sulting power spectral density as a function of the
reciprocal value of the frequency (the periodicity)
is shown in Fig. 6. Distinct maxima can be seen
at 6, 19, 23, and ca. 50, 90 and 175 kyr. These
periodicities are the result of the interplay between
the complex movement of Z’s and Earth’s orbital
planes and should not be confused with similar val-
ues delivered by the Milankovitch theory. Here, the
decisive parameters are the oscillation of both incli-
nations (about 9–10 kyr, and 100 kyr, respectively)
and the movements of both perihelia [32]. In the
high frequency domain these values compare quite
well with those obtained from comparable analysis
of the GRIP data displayed in Fig. 1. The peak
observed at 90 kyr is close to the famous 100 kyr
observed in the deep see sediment data. This sug-
gest that the Interstadials might be the result of
an enhanced clustering of the Dansgaard-Oeschger
events.
It should be noted, however, that such a
comparison is problematic for two reasons: First
of all, the results of our spectral analysis depend
on the selected orbital parameters and in particular
on the mass of Z. Therefore, we can only say that
the evaluated periodicities of the postulated Green-
house eﬀect are not in contradiction with observa-
tion. Second, any comparison with deep sea sedi-
ment data is questionable, because the time scale
of these measurements is usually tuned to the 100
kyr cycle of Earth’s orbital eccentricity.

6 Earth’s past

a
record of planet Z’s history

climate:

In chapter 1 we pointed to the strange fact that
Earth’s climate was remarkably stable prior to the
Ice Age epoch. Actually, the δ18O record of benthic
foraminiferas from the Ocean Drilling program, site
659, shown in Fig. 7, suggests three diﬀerent cli-
mate regimes for the last 5.0 Myr [9, 37]. The ﬁrst
phase is characterised by a very stable climate with
small polar ice shields, and, in comparison with the
following regimes, high temperature if it is assumed
that ice extension and mean global temperature are
correlated. This climate state is similar to that of
the Holocene. A sudden drop in the global mean
temperature terminated this state at about 3.2 Myr
ago. In the following period the variability of the
climate began to increase until about 1.0 Myr ago.
At this time the proxy dates indicate a further drop
of the mean temperature to the lowest known level
in Earth history. This marks the beginning of the
Ice Age epoch discussed in the previous chapter. It

Figure 7: Benthic foraminifera δ180 record from site 659 (18◦ 05’N, 21◦ 02’), according to Ref.[37]. This
spectrum is a proxy for the extension and variation of the polar ice shields over the last 5.0 My. Increasing
δ18O corresponds to decreasing ice caps and to warmer climate. The late Pliocene (before 3.2 Myr) is
characterized by small ice caps and remarkably stable climatic conditions comparable to those of the
Holocene. The corresponding value is shown by the horizontal dashed line.

is obvious, that the properties of these three, or ac-
tually four diﬀerent climate epochs, including the
Holocene, cannot be explained in terms of the orig-
inal Milankovitch theory, unless changes of solar ir-
radiance or Earth’s orbital parameters according to
observations are postulated. However, the intro-
duction of such changes is hard to justify.

6.1 Some more polar shifts

In view of what has been derived so far the spec-
trum in Fig. 7 can be interpreted in a new way.
Prior to about 3.3 Myr ago planet Z was inactive.
If it existed, it was not yet on a highly eccentric or-
bit, cold, and without gas cloud. The climate was
stable showing only the moderate changes which ac-
tually reﬂect the undisturbed Milankovitch eﬀect.
In agreement with this theory no 100 kyr-cycle ap-
pears up to this time [8]. The fact that the size
of the continental ice caps during this period was
comparable to the present day value indicate that
Earth’s North pole was then located either in the
Northern part of the Atlantic, in the Paciﬁc Ocean,
It
or at about the same position as it is today.
should be possible to evaluate its actual position
using information on the climate in various regions
during the Pliocene, and/or from geomagnetic ﬁeld
measurements. Around 3.2 Myr ago we assume
that planet Z shifted Earth’s North pole towards
the North American continent in the way described
in chapter 3. As a consequence, the continental ice

shields started to grow and with it Earth’s albedo,
which reduced the global mean temperature. Of
course, this implies that Z was on an eccentric Earth
crossing orbit not later than at this time. Tidal
heating consumed orbital energy so that its ma-
jor semi-axis was slowly reduced. As mentioned in
chapter 4, we are unable to decide in which way
its eccentricity changed. The growing amplitudes
of the climatic changes between about 3.2 and 1.0
Myr suggest a slowly growing gas cloud, which in-
dicates an increasing orbital eccentricity. The tidal
eﬀects increased as well, which accelerated the heat-
ing up of Z. About 1.0 Myr ago, a second polar shift
in direction toward the North American continent
to the position assumed in chapter 3 further low-
ered the global temperature. The Ice Age epoch
began. At this time the gas cloud was developed
to its full size and the resulting Greenhouse heating
created the temperature variations described in the
previous chapter. A third and ﬁnal polar shift ter-
minated Earth’s Ice Age epoch 11.5 kyr ago, as dis-
cussed in chapter 3. The polar ice caps readjusted
to the new position and, because of the diminishing
size of the continental ice sheets, the global tem-
perature increased during the early Holocene to its
present value.

The suggestion that Earth’s pole was shifted at
least three times during the last 3.2 Myr is compat-
ible with the orbital calculations presented in chap-
ter 4. They show that Z approached the Earth to
polar shift distances about once in a million years,

15

so that more than one shift event may be expected
during the time range considered here. The direc-
tion of the polar shift depends on the geographic
position of the closest approach. Antipode events
excite the same directional shift, while those at posi-
tions diﬀering by 180◦ in longitude only, or positions
with the same longitude but equal northern, respec-
tively southern latitudes lead to opposite motions.
The earlier shifts occured with encounters outside
the Roche limit, which are more likely and, in view
of the larger mass of Z at early times, suﬃcient to
produce the required deformation.

6.2 On the origin and fate of planet

Z

At this point it is tempting to speculate on the ori-
gin of Z. We see three possibilities: First, Z was
originally on a hyperbolic trajectory but, during
a close encounter with Jupiter, transferred to the
required highly eccentric bound orbit. The major
semi-axis A of such an orbit would be larger than
half of Jupiter’s orbital radius, i.e. A > 2.6 AU,
because of the presumably large initial velocity at
the inﬂection point. Such a large A is not com-
patible with our orbital calculations in chapter 4,
which suggest A ≈ 1 AU. Second, Z was originally
a moon of Jupiter which was ejected due to the
coupling with the other moons of Jupiter. Such an
emission could result in a rather small initial ve-
locity and accordingly to a highly eccentric orbit.
Again, this is unlikely for the same reason as be-
fore. The last possibility relates to the Asteroid
It has been argued that the aster-
belt problem.
oids circling the sun at a mean distance of about
2.7 AU could be the remains of a collision between
two larger bodies, one originally bound to the sun,
the other presumably entering the solar system on
a hyperbolic trajectory. Assuming that Planet Z
was a reaction product of such a collision emerging
with low velocity, then the major semi-axis of its or-
bit would be not much larger than about A = 1.35
AU at the beginning of its journey around the sun.
Considering the time required to reduce the orbital
energy and to increase its eccentricity to the ﬁnal
values estimated in chapter 4, it is the most likely
scenario.

It is open to discussion at what time Z disap-
peared. One possibility is that in the last close en-
counter it lost its angular momentum and plunged
into the Sun. However, this requires an excentric-
ity of not less than 0.98, and it supposes that the
angular momentum received is opposed to the ex-
isting one. Therefore it seems more likely that the

last encounter with the Earth was within the Roche
limit, so that Z split into several parts. As a result
of the reduced escape velocities of the debris, these
parts lost material at an accelerated rate and were
completely dissolved during the Holocene. The gas
and dust clouds were expelled from the planetary
system by radiation pressure.

7 A new understanding of

Earth’s past climate

The previous chapters showed that the observed
complex structure of Earth’s climate changes dur-
ing the last few Million years can be explained in
terms of a single object of planetary size, which was
bound to the sun on a highly eccentric orbit for a
limited time. This planet, called Z, was surrounded
by a gas cloud and interacted gravitationally and
through its gas cloud with the Earth and its atmo-
sphere with a frequency determined by the pattern
of its closest approaches to the Earth. These eﬀects
inﬂuenced Earth’s climate in two diﬀerent ways.

Each polar shift event started with a huge ﬂood,
exceptionally strong winds, earthquakes and vol-
canic activities and ended with a displaced pole po-
sition after a couple of years. Following this shift
the polar ice caps adjusted to the new pole position
which changed Earth’s reﬂectivity, the albedo, and
accordingly the global temperature. The new pole
position determined whether this temperature was
higher or lower after the shift. In agreement with
observation we found that this happened about
three times during the last 3.2 Myr. Two times the
temperature dropped, suggesting that each time the
pole was shifted closer towards the North Ameri-
can continent, so that the size of the continental
part of the polar ice cap increased. During the last
event 11.5 kyr ago, it was moved into the arctic
sea. At this position a net reduction of the polar ice
caps prevailed. As a result of the reduced albedo,
the global temperature increased to the presently
known value. We also found that Z passed the
Earth about 6 times in 100 kyr at distances less than
300 000 km. All of these ﬂyby’s were close enough
to excite large tides followed by earth quakes and
volcanic activities. Recently, it has been suggested
that the so called Heinrich events observed in the
North Atlantic sediments during the last 100 kyrs
— a rare, but distinct ice rafting phenomenon —
could be the result of unusual, strong earthquakes
[38, 39]. It is interesting to note that the observed 6
Heinrich-events per 100 kyr compare well with the
predicted frequency for sub-lunar ﬂybys.

16

The interaction between the gas cloud of Z and
Earth’s atmosphere was quite spectacular as well,
since most of the kinetic energy of the particles
stopped in the upper atmosphere was converted
into radiation. Probably, this radiation was intense
enough to even ignite extended ﬁres on Earth’s
surface. After a couple of days the ﬁres were
extinct either by the ﬂood, by heavy rain or by
snow enriched with nitrous acid. When the atmo-
sphere was cleared of the light absorbing compo-
nents, the radiative forcing of the produced Green-
house gases began to prevail, so that globally the
temperature rapidly increased within a few years
to the maximum value determined by the amount
of Greenhouse gases produced during the encounter.
The Greenhouse eﬀect was a transient phenomenon,
whose impact was limited by the amount of the Ni-
trogen compounds produced per encounter and the
residence time of these gases. It may be responsible
for the Dansgaard-Oeschger events observed dur-
ing the Late Pleistocene. If so, then the Interstadi-
als may be explained in terms of the quasi-periodic
clustering of these events, as shown in chapter 5.2.

Summarizing, the many abrupt climate changes
characterising Earth’s Ice Age epoch may reﬂect the
interaction between Z and Earth during the last 3.2
Myr. These interactions were global catastrophes,
the worst of which resulted in a polar wandering.
These particular events even irreversibly changed
Earth’s climate. The last polar shift event occurred
only 11.5 kyr ago. As pointed out in chapter 2,
the violence of this event is well documented by the
observed sudden death of many animals, the ex-
tinction of some of the larger mammal species and
the sudden rise of the sea level [14]. Possibly the
traditions in old cultures of catastrophic events re-
fer to the events mentioned above. Presently, we
are enjoying a perfectly Milankovitch-driven mod-
erate climate without the extreme and fast tem-
perature variations observed prior to the last polar
shift event. This may be due to the fact that planet
Z is no longer inﬂuencing the Earth. We are conﬁ-
dent that this new and pleasant climate state, called
Holocene, shall last for an indeﬁnite time, provided,
we are willing to stop our own “Greenhouse attack”
on Earth’s climate.

Although we have presented a consistent expla-
nation of the complex structure of Earth’s climate
variation during the last few Million years, we are
aware that this rather exotic story has opened up
more questions than it answered, because many of
our arguments are based on considerations which
are in terms of order of magnitude and very elemen-
tary. Nevertheless, we believe that this proposal

merits further investigation, in view of its basic sim-
plicity. In particular, we encourage state of the art
calculations which could narrow the allowed param-
eter range of the hypothetical planet, or even dis-
prove its existence. Of importance would be model
calculations for the global climate for both pole po-
sition, with and without the suggested additional
Greenhouse eﬀect. Our static approach to Earth’s
deformation during a ﬂy-by should be replaced by
a dynamical calculation. The actual amount of ma-
terial that evaporates from a large body during its
closest approach to the sun deserves a more detailed
investigation. The sequence and eﬃciency of re-
actions initiated by an energetic atom, Silicon for
instance, impinging on and stopped in the upper-
most atmosphere, has to be further clariﬁed, if nec-
essary, with the help of appropriate experiments.
A determination of the maximum age of the ice at
the Siberian side of the Arctic and/or at the At-
lantic side of the Antarctic could provide a test of
the polar shift theory. We are optimistic, that the
combined results of such studies will ﬁnally con-
verge to a new understanding of Earth’s Ice Age
epoch. A negative answer implies that the strange
variability of the climate during this epoch, as well
as the stepwise cooling of Earth’s climate beginning
about 3.2 Mio years and its abrupt ending only 11.5
kyr ago remain unexplained. We are sceptical that
these problems can be solved by means of any of
the presently favoured Milankovich-based theories
alone.

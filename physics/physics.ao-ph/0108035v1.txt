Time series both of microwave radiometer brightness temperature measurements at 23.8 and 31.4
GHz and of retrievals of water vapor and liquid water path from these brightness temperatures are
evaluated using the detrended ﬂuctuation analysis method. As quantiﬁed by the parameter α, this
method (i) enables identiﬁcation of the time scales over which noise dominates the time series and
(ii) characterizes the temporal range of correlations in the time series. The more common spectral
analysis method is also used to assess the data and its results are compared with those from de-
trended ﬂuctuation analysis method. The assumption that measurements should have certain scaling
properties allows the quality of the measurements to be characterized. The additional assumption
that the scaling properties of the measurements of an atmospheric quantity are preserved in a useful
retrieval provides a means for evaluating the retrieval itself. Applying these two assumptions to
microwave radiometer measurements and retrievals demonstrates three points. First, the retrieved
water vapor path during cloudy-sky periods can be dominated by noise on shorter than 30 min time
scales (α-exponent = 0.1) and exhibits no scaling behavior at longer time scales. However, correla-
tions in the brightness temperatures and liquid water path retrievals are found to be consistent with
a power-law behavior for time scales up to 3 hr with an α-exponent equal to approximately 0.3, as in
other geophysical phenomena. Second, clear-sky, moist atmospheres show the expected scaling for
both measurements and retrievals of the water vapor path. Third, during clear-sky, dry atmospheric
days, instrument noise from the 31.4 GHz channel compromises the quality of the water vapor path
retrieval. The detrended ﬂuctuation analysis method is thus proposed as means for assessing the
quality of both the instrument data and the retrieved parameters obtained from these data.

I. INTRODUCTION

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric
Radiation Measurement (ARM) program (Stokes and
Schwarts 1994) now operates two-channel microwave ra-
diometers (Liljegren et al. 1994) at its Southern Great
Plains (SGP), Tropical Western Paciﬁc (TWP), and
North Slope of Alaska (NSA) sites. The DOE ARM mi-
crowave radiometers operate at frequencies of 23.8 and
31.4 GHz and are used to retrieve column water vapor
and liquid water amounts (Liljegren and Lesht 1996).
The range of atmospheric conditions across the three
DOE ARM sites is extreme, raising questions concerning
the reliability of the measurements and the retrievals. For
these reasons, Liljegren (1999) has implemented an auto-
mated scheme for calibrating the instrument radiances at
the diﬀerent sites that dramatically improves their qual-
ity. Moreover, Liljegren et al. (2000) have developed a
new retrieval for water vapor and liquid water path that

attempts to remove biases resulting from changes in at-
mospheric conditions from one measurement to the next.
Additional approaches to retrieving accurate estimates of
column water vapor and liquid water paths currently are
being pursued, such as the Bayesian approach adopted
by McFarlane et al. (2000).

(2000) and McFarlane et al.

An important motivation for the eﬀorts of Liljegren
et al.
(2000) is that the
accuracy of the existing retrieval of cloud liquid water
path (Westwater 1993; Liljegren and Lesht 1996) is not
suﬃcient for many emerging studies on the interaction
between stratus clouds and atmospheric radiation.
In
particular, biases over several-hour periods in the exist-
ing liquid water path retrieval frequently occurr, render-
ing their use in atmospheric radiation transfer studies
diﬃcult at best. Using a specially designed analysis tech-
nique that is insensitive to these biases, we concentrate in
this study on characterizing the quality of the measure-
ments and retrievals based on assessment of the correla-
tions between ﬂuctuations in these signals. The empha-

1

sis here is on analyzing the ﬂuctuations and ascertaining
the temporal range over which they are correlated. This
range is limited by the discretization step of the measure-
ments and by the inherent lifetimes of cloudy or clear-sky
atmospheric conditions.

Often the nonlinear processes at work in the atmo-
sphere produce data series of such complexity that tra-
ditional statistical and spectral analyses techniques fail
to extract meaningful physical information. Better tech-
niques are clearly required. Recently, there have been
several studies demonstrating that long-range power-law
correlations (Peng et al. 1992) can be analyzed to give
relevant time scales in, generally called, self-organized
critical systems (Bak et al. 1989).

We study both the statistical properties of microwave
radiometer measurements, as given by the 23.8 and 31.4
GHz channel brightness temperatures TB 1 and TB 2, and
the liquid water path (LWP) and water vapor path
(WVP) retrieved from them. As a means of assessing
the validity of the retrievals, we determine how well they
preserve the correlations of the ﬂuctuations that initially
exist in the measurements. We apply the detrended ﬂuc-
tuation analysis (DFA) method (Peng et al. 1994) to
characterize the correlations in the signals. This method
has been successfull in the investigation of long-range
memory eﬀects in biological (Stanley et al. 1993; Haus-
dorﬀ et al. 1995) and ﬁnancial (Vandewalle and Ausloos
1997; Ausloos and Ivanova 1999; Ausloos et al. 1999;
Ausloos et al. 2000) data ﬂuctuations, as well as to study
long-range power-law correlations in the Southern Oscil-
lation Index (Ausloos and Ivanova 2000) and atmospheric
signals to identify stratus cloud breaking (Ivanova and
Ausloos 1999a; Ivanova et al. 2000).

We use the DFA to show that the water vapor path
retrieval destroys the correlations in the brightness tem-
perature measurements for a cloudy atmosphere and we
propose an explanation for this (numerical) destruction.
In addition, we characterize the contributions of instru-
ment noise to the measurements during dry and moist
clear-sky conditions.

Finally, we contrast DFA method results to those from
spectral analysis (Davis et al. 1994; Davis et al. 1996;
Ivanova and Ackerman 1999) of the same signals, illus-
trating the strength of the DFA method relative to the
spectral method for nonstationary conditions typifying
the atmosphere.

The paper is organized as follows.

In section 2 we
describe the data sets and the retrieved quantities that
are analyzed. Section 3 sketches the methods of analysis
used, while the results are presented in section 4. The
main ﬁndings of the study are discussed in section 5 and
summarized in section 6 where we also suggest directions
for future work.

II. DATA ANALYZED

The data used in this study are the radiances,
recorded as brightness temperatures, measured with a
Radiometrics Model WVR-1100 microwave radiometer
at frequencies of 23.8 and 31.4 GHz and the verti-
cal column amounts of cloud liquid water and water
vapor retrieved from these measurements (Westwater
1993). The microwave radiometer is equipped with a
Gaussian-lensed microwave antenna whose small-angle
receiving cone is steered with a rotating ﬂat mirror
(http://www.arm.gov). The data for this particular
study are from the microwave radiometer located at the
DOE ARM SGP central facility. For all four case study
periods the microwave radiometer operated in vertically
pointing mode. In this mode the radiometer makes se-
quential 1 s radiance measurements in each of the two
channels while pointing vertically upward into the atmo-
sphere. After collecting these radiances the radiometer
mirror is rotated to view a blackbody reference target.
For each of the two channels the radiometer records the
radiance from the reference immediately followed by a
measurement of a combined radiance from the reference
and a calibrated noise diode. This measurement cycle is
repeated once every 20 s.

A shorter measurement cycle does not necessarily lead
to a larger number of independent samples. For example,
clouds at 2 km of altitude moving at 10 m s−1 take 15 s
to advect through a radiometer ﬁeld-of-view of approx-
imately 5◦. Note that the 1 s sky radiance integration
time ensures that the retrieved quantities correspond to
a speciﬁc column of cloud above the instrument, as op-
posed to some longer time average of the cloud properties
in the column above the instrument.

The ﬁeld of view of the microwave radiometer is 5.7◦ at
23.8 GHz and 4.6◦ at 31.4 GHz. The brightness temper-
ature is measured with a random error of approximately
±0.5K. The atmosphere is not optically thick at these
two microwave radiometer frequencies during cloudy con-
ditions. Hence, these two frequencies can be used to re-
trieve the total column amounts of water vapor and cloud
liquid water. The error for the liquid water retrieval is
estimated to be less than about 0.005 g/cm2 (Liljegren et
al. 2000). The water vapor path retrievals are considered
to have an absolute accuracy of better than 5%.

Three cases are considered in the current study: (i)
a six-day stratus cloud event, January 9 to 14, 1998,
which is an exceptionally long lasting cloudy period for
the Southern Great Plains site, that allows us to analyze
an unusually long time series of 25772 data points, (ii)
a cloudless dry day, September 29, 1997, which has 3812
data points and (iii) a cloudless moist day, September 18,
1997, which has 4296 data points.

III. DATA ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES

power-law dependence on frequency f ,

We use two techniques of analysis: the detrended ﬂuc-
tuation analysis (DF A) and the more common technique
of standard spectral analysis. The DF A technique (Peng
et al. 1994) begins with dividing a random variable se-
quence y(t) of length N into N/τ non-overlapping boxes,
each containing τ points. Then, the local trend (assumed
to be linear in this investigation) z(t) = at + b in each
box is computed using a linear least-squares ﬁt to the
It is worth noting that the
data points in that box.
trend assumption can be generalized without any diﬃ-
culty (Vandewalle and Ausloos 1998) and without giving
rise to drastic changes in the output results. This local
trend removal should be contrasted to that of the com-
mon spectral analysis, in which the trend is sometimes
removed over the entire time series.

We deﬁne the mean square diﬀerence over an interval

of length τ as

F 2(τ ) =

[y(t) − z(t)]2,

k = 0, 1, 2, · · · , (

−1).

N
τ

1
τ

(k+1)τ

Xt=kτ +1

(1)
Averaging F 2(τ ) over the N/τ intervals gives the DFA-
function hF 2(τ )i that describes the correlation in ﬂuctu-
ations as a function of τ . The procedure is repeated for
almost all realistic τ -interval sizes and the behavior of the
DFA-function is expected to follow a power law (Peng et
al. 1994)

hF 2(τ )i1/2 ∼ τ α.

(2)

An exponent α 6= 1/2 over a certain range of τ values im-
plies the existence of long-range correlations in that time
interval. In fact, the exponent α is equal to the Hurst
exponent of the rescaled range (R/S) method, often de-
noted H1, or H, in the literature (Hurst et al. 1965). An
α < 1/2 indicates antipersistence (Addison 1997), mean-
ing that an increment in a signal is most likely followed
by a decrement in the signal and vice versa. In contrast,
α > 1/2 indicates persistence whereby increments in a
signal are most likely followed by additional increments,
and decrements in a signal are most likely followed by
additional decrements. For α = 0.5, an increment in a
signal is equally likely to be followed by either an incre-
ment or decrement and similarly for a decrement. Ran-
dom Brownian motion signals are characterized by an
exponent α = 0.5, while Gaussian white noise sequences
have α = 0. For fractional Brownian motion, α 6= 0.5
(Turcotte 1997; Addison 1997).

To relate the DFA results to more common analysis
techniques, we investigate the high-frequency behavior of
the ﬂuctuations by applying the standard spectral anal-
ysis method (Panter 1965). The power spectral density
S(f ) of an (assumed self-aﬃne) time series y(t) has a

S(f ) ∼

(3)

following from the Fourier transform of the signal (Panter
1965).
If the two scaling exponents α and β are well
deﬁned, then the Wiener-Khinchin relation β = 2α + 1
holds for 0 < α < 1 (1 < β < 3) (Turcotte 1997; Monin
and Yaglom 1975; Heneghan and McDarby 2000).
In
terms of the exponents (α and β) of the signal, we can
talk about pink noise α = 0 (β = 1), brown noise α = 1/2
(β = 2) or black noise α > 1/2 (β > 2) (Schroeder
1991). Black noise is related to persistence. In contrast,
inertial subrange turbulence for which β = 5/3 gives α =
1/3 (Frisch 1995), which places it in the antipersistence
regime.

The main advantages of the DFA method over other
techniques, such as the Fourier transform (Panter 1965)
and the rescaled range (R/S) (Hurst et al. 1965) meth-
ods, are: (i) local and large-scale trends are avoided, and
(ii) the upper scaling limit (here the correlation time)
crossover is well deﬁned. In contrast, detrending of data
before applying a Fourier transform leads to questions
about the accuracy of the spectral exponent. For exam-
ple, we know that the Fourier transform is inadequate
for non-stationary signals.
(An excellent discussion of
these aspects may be found in Pelletier (1997).) Thus,
we expect that the DFA method will allow a better un-
derstanding of the noise contribution to the retrieved se-
quences for diﬀerent atmospheric conditions.

Finally, in order to determine how a noise-like sequence
alters the scaling properties of a signal, we also perform
a sensitivity-to-noise study by adding synthetic Gaussian
white noise with a mean of zero and a variance of one to
a signal with well deﬁned scaling properties. Namely,
we added Gaussian white noise to the liquid water path
signal for the cloudy-sky case period.

IV. RESULTS

We ﬁrst present results from the cloudy-sky case study
period to demonstrate the scaling properties expected of
LWP retrievals (Ivanova et al. 2000; Davis et al. 1994).
A similar analysis of WVP retrieval for the cloudy day
yields diﬀerent results. We next present results from the
dry clear-sky case study to illustrate how the inﬂuence
of instrument noise is characterized by the analysis tech-
nique and to determine the range of scales over which
instrument noise dominates the statistics of measured
and retrieved quantities. The last case we consider is
the moist clear-sky day.

A. Cloudy-sky Atmosphere

Consider microwave radiometer brightness tempera-
ture measurements at 23.8 and 31.4 GHz, and retrieved

3

liquid water path (LWP) and water vapor path (WVP)
for a cloudy atmosphere. Data are plotted in Fig. 1.
These measurements were obtained at the ARM South-
ern Great Plains site during the period from January 9
to 14, 1998 and consist of N = 25772 data points mea-
sured with a time resolution of 20 s. The DFA-functions
hF 2(τ )i1/2 for the four time series are shown in Fig. 2.
For this case the short-term ﬂuctuation amplitudes in
both the 23.8 and the 31.4 GHz frequency channels are
clearly much larger than the 0.5 K ﬂuctuations expected
from instrument noise (see Fig. 1a,b). Hence, instru-
mental noise contribution is negligible and the bright-
ness temperatures TB 1 and TB 2 for both the 23.8 and
the 31.4 GHz frequency channels, exhibit well deﬁned
scaling properties from 3 to about 150 minutes with an
exponent α = 0.36 ± 0.01 (see Figs. 2a,b and Table 1).

To estimate the correlations of the ﬂuctuations in the
liquid water retrieval we plot the DFA-function in Fig.
2d for the liquid water path (LWP) data shown in Fig.
1d. Part of this result has been presented in one of our
previous studies (Ivanova et al., 2000). We view and dis-
cuss it here in the framework of both the direct radiance
data TB 1 and TB 2, and the subsequent retrievals of liq-
uid water path and water vapor path. Speciﬁcs of the
retrieval method are discussed in section 5. Similar to
the measured brightness temperatures TB 1 and TB 2, the
DFA-function for the LWP follows a power law with an
exponent α = 0.36 ± 0.01 holding over about two decades
in time, i.e., from 3 to 150 minutes. The correlation coef-
ﬁcient is R = 0.997. A crossover to Brownian-like motion
with α = 0.47 ± 0.03 is readily seen for longer correlation
times for TB 1, TB 2 and LWP data in Figs. 2a,b,d.

One should note that the lower limit of the scaling
range is determined by the resolution and discretization
step of the measurements. Because a cloud moves at a
typical speed of 10 m/s and the radiometer is always di-
rected upward toward the same point in the atmosphere,
the 20 s discretization step is chosen to ensure ergodic
sampling over the 5◦ observation angle of the instrument.
The upper scaling range limit depends on the life time
of the cloud system. For the data in Fig. 1, the stra-
tus cloud lasts for 6 days, which is an exceptionally long
lasting cloudy period for the Southern Great Plains site,
allowing our access to an unusually long time series of
25772 data points.

These results clearly support the hypothesis that
power-law correlations exist in the ﬂuctuations of the
integrated cloud liquid water for a wide range of time
scales. These power laws are interpreted as signatures
of propagation of some correlated information across the
cloud system for as long as 150 minutes. The results for
the liquid water path and the two brightness temperature
measurements are also consistent with the calculation of
the ﬁrst order Hq|q=1-exponent; here H1 = 0.29 as ob-
tained from a separate multifractal analysis (Marshak et
al. 1997, Ivanova and Ausloos 1999b; Kiely and Ivanova
1999, Tessier et al. 1993, Lovejoy et al. 1996) of re-
motely measured liquid water path (Ivanova and Acker-

man 1999) and of directly measured liquid water content
in an oceanic stratus cloud system (Davis et al. 1994).

In contrast, the scaling properties of the retrieved wa-
ter vapor path are compromised. The DFA-function
(plotted in Fig. 2c) exhibits noise-like ﬂuctuations from
about 3 to about 30 min with an exponent α ≈ 0.10 (Ta-
ble 1). To understand the reason for this behavior in the
water vapor column retrieval for a cloudy atmosphere we
examine in section 5 each step of the retrieval procedure
to determine where the change in the correlations of the
ﬂuctuations occurs (Westwater 1978; Liljegren and Lesht
1996).

We relate the DFA results to those given by a spectral
analysis of the brightness temperatures TB 1 and TB 2 and
the two retrievals, whose spectra are plotted in Fig. 3.
The scaling properties of the LWP and the two bright-
ness temperatures are characterized by exponents β that
are consistent, within large error bars, with the DFA-
α values according to the relation β = 2α + 1 (Table 2).
The WVP spectrum (Fig. 3c) exhibits a noise-like contri-
bution at high frequencies that corresponds to the short
time scales given by the DFA-function in Fig. 2c. The
large variability in the power spectra leads to large un-
certainties in the estimates of the spectral (β) exponent.
This problem of the discrete Fourier transform is known
as spectral variance and has been discussed comprehen-
sively by many authors, among them Priestly (1981) and
Percival and Walden (1994).

B. Dry Clear-sky Atmosphere

To test whether or not the correlations of the ﬂuctua-
tions are preserved for other atmospheric conditions, we
analyze the brightness temperature measurements TB 1
and TB 2, and the retrieved liquid water path and wa-
ter vapor path for an extremely dry clear-sky (Fig. 4).
The precipitable water estimated by radiosonde measure-
ments for this dry day, September 29, 1997, is of order of
0.9 cm. These measurements were obtained at the ARM
Southern Great Plains site and consist of N = 3812 data
points measured with a time resolution of 20 s.

The DFA-functions hF 2(τ )i1/2 for these four data se-
ries are shown in Fig. 5. The DFA-function in Fig.
5b illustrates that the 31.4 GHz brightness temperature
channel is dominated by instrumental noise at short time-
scales as a result of both the very low levels of absolute
humidity and the absence of any liquid water. As ex-
pected, the inﬂuence of instrument noise on the 31.4 GHz
channel is particularly severe. The spectral analysis re-
sult (Fig. 6) can be interpreted along these lines as well.
The drop in the value of α from the measured to the re-
trieved quantities (Fig. 5, Table 1) for the time range
from about 3 to 150 min is a result of adding measure-
ment noise in the retrieval process (section 5). For this
dry clear-sky case the LWP signal analysis demonstrates
noise in the LWP over all time scales, which is expected

4

owing to the absence of cloud liquid water. The retrieval
of small LWP values in the absence of actual cloud liquid
water is an artifact of the retrieval process. This problem
is being addressed with an improved retrieval algorithm
(Liljegren et al. 2000; McFarlane et al. 2000).

To determine how a noise-like sequence alters the scal-
ing properties of a signal with well-deﬁned scaling proper-
ties when it is superimposed on a signal, we performed an
idealized sensitivity-to-noise study. We add a synthetic
Gaussian white noise with a mean of zero and a variance
of one to the liquid water path data in Fig. 1d. The
original signal is anticorrelated with α = 0.36. The noise
signal is added in successive steps with an amplitude ǫ
ranging from 1/16 to 1/2 of the LWP signal amplitude.
Results for the DFA-function < F 2(τ ) >1/2 for two cases,
1/4 and 1/2 noise-to-signal ratio, are plotted in Fig. 7a
as curves (ii) and (iii). The α-values for the noisy signals
are plotted in Fig. 7b as a function of the noise-to-signal
ratio ǫ, which can be viewed as representing the degree
of noise contamination. An exponential decrease of the
α-values relative to zero-noise-value-α = 0.36, with ǫ is
observed for the LWP signal.

In Fig. 7c the respective power spectra are plotted.
Note that spectrum labeled (iii) in Fig. 7c, which is the
spectrum of a complex signal obtained from the superpo-
sition of Gaussian white noise on the LWP signal, is very
similar to the spectrum of the WVP retrieval shown in
Fig. 3c. However, the DFA-function labeled (iii) in Fig.
7a of the same complex signal is similar to the DFA-
function in Fig. 2c at small time scales only. The dif-
ferences at large time scales are related to the fact that
the data series analyzed are quite diﬀerent, one being
the LWP signal plus white noise and the other being the
WVP retrieval data (Fig. 1c). While spectral analysis
shows noise in both cases, the detrended ﬂuctuation anal-
ysis method ﬁnds diﬀerences between the two time series,
which emphasize some of the advantages of the detrended
ﬂuctuation analysis over spectral analysis method when
studying correlations and anticorrelations of the ﬂuctua-
tions of a signal.

C. Moist Clear-sky Atmosphere

September 18, 1997 is an example of a cloudless day
that has a very high level of absolute humidity. The
precipitable water on this day is of the order of 4-5 cm.
Data consist of N = 4296 data points and are plotted in
Fig. 8 for the microwave radiometer brightness temper-
atures TB 1 and TB 2, and the two retrievals. The mea-
sured brightness temperatures in both channels have val-
ues that are substantially greater than the cosmic back-
ground plus instrument noise (Fig. 8a,b). Detrended
ﬂuctuation analysis of the measurements and retrievals
highlight this aspect of the data (Fig. 9). The 23.8
GHz brightness temperature measurements and the re-
trieved WVP scale with exponents α = 0.33 ± 0.02 and

α = 0.31±0.02, over approximately a 4 hour interval (Ta-
ble 1). However, the 31.4 GHz brightness temperature
measurements scale with an exponent of α = 0.23 ± 0.02,
exhibiting a higher degree of anticorrelation in the ﬂuc-
tuations as found when there are relatively higher noise
contributions (Fig. 7b). This result is not unexpected,
as the 31.4 GHz channel is more sensitive to cloud liquid
water.

The spectral analysis results are plotted in Fig. 10.
Spectral scaling exponents β estimated for the frequency
range consistent with the lower scale range of the DFA-
function for the two brightness temperature measure-
ments and the WVP retrieval. They are summarized
in Table 2. Each β exponent is found to be in agreement
within the error bars, with the corresponding α value for
the same data via the theoretical relation β = 2α + 1)
(Table 1). The ﬂat, high-frequency parts of the spectra
in Fig. 10 for periods below 1 min, illustrate the con-
tribution of noise even to measurements and retrievals
under moist, clear-sky atmospheric conditions. The very
high frequency noise for time periods below 1 min is bet-
ter identiﬁed by the spectral analysis then by the DFA
method.

V. DISCUSSION

The loss of scaling in the WVP retrievals for the
cloudy-sky case study period was not anticipated and re-
quires an explanation. We now brieﬂy outline the WVP
and LWP retrieval scheme (Westwater 1978; Liljegren
and Lesht 1996) in order to identify the step in the re-
trieval at which noise-like behavior is introduced into the
WVP retrieval.

If the total atmospheric transmission at frequency ν is
written as exp (−τν ), then measurements of microwave
radiometer brightness temperature TBν can be converted
to opacity τν by

τν = ln

(Tmr − Tc)
(Tmr − TBν ) (cid:21)

,

(cid:20)

(4a)

where Tc is the cosmic background “big bang” bright-
ness temperature equal to 2.8 K and Tmr is an estimated
“mean radiating temperature” of the atmosphere. (Note
that Eq. 4a holds for nonprecipitating clouds, i.e., clouds
having drops suﬃciently small that scattering is negligi-
ble.) Writing τν in terms of atmospheric constituents, we
have

τν = κVνV + κLνL + τdν,

(4b)

where κVν and κLν are path-averaged mass absorption
coeﬃcients of water vapor and liquid water and τdν is the
absorption by dry atmosphere constituents (i.e., oxygen).
Removing the dry atmosphere opacity from τν, we have

From measurements at the 23.8 GHz channel, sensitive
primarily to water vapor, and the 31.4 GHz channel, sen-
sitive primarily to cloud liquid water, we can write two

To identify the retrieval step that produces changes in
the correlations of the ﬂuctuations, we perform DF A-
analysis on time series of

and Eqs. 5, 6, and 7 for the cloud-sky case study period.
To understand whether or not holding Tmr constant in
Eqs. 5, 6, and 7 is the source of the noise, we generate
two time series from each of Eqs. 5, 6, and 7 (Table 3).
In the ﬁrst time series for each equation we hold Tmr ﬁxed
at its monthly-averaged climatological value (Table 4), as
in the retrieval, while for each of the second time series
we estimate a new value of Tmr for each 20 s sample us-
ing other measurements available at the DOE ARM SGP
site. We do this for each of the two frequencies ν, gener-
ating a total of 12 sequences. In these 12 sequences we
kept the absorption coeﬃcients κLν and κVν (ν = ν1, ν2)
ﬁxed. The new scheme of Liljegren et al. (2000) allows
for variable absorption coeﬃcients and mean radiating
temperatures in the retrieval of WVP and LWP. So, we
implement their new scheme and perform a WVP and
LWP retrieval with it for this cloud-sky case study pe-
riod. Overall, we generated 14 time series to which we
apply the DF A-analysis.

For all 14 data sequences, except the three water
vapor signals, the DF A-functions scale with exponent
α = 0.36 ± 0.01, as did the original measurements of
both TB1 and TB2. In contrast, each of the three water

vapor path data sequences has the same noise-like, short-
range scaling behavior. Therefore, the change in short-
term ﬂuctuations of retrieved water vapor path does not
result from ﬁxed coeﬃcients and mean radiating temper-
atures, but rather from the transformation of the signals
from opacity (Eq. 5) to WVP (Eq. 7). Although the
transformation from brightness temperature to opacity
(Eq. 5) involves a non-linear operation, we ﬁnd that the
logarithmic operation preserves the character of the ﬂuc-
tuations.

To understand why Eqs. 6 and 7, which are similar,
exhibit diﬀerent scaling properties, we analyze the rela-
tive magnitudes and signs of l1, l2, v1 and v2 in conjunc-
tion with the range and ﬂuctuations in the brightness
temperature measurements TB1 and TB2. Atmospheric
brightness temperatures and opacities, as well as their
ﬂuctuations, at the frequencies of the two channels de-
pend on the emission of water vapor, liquid water (for a
cloudy atmosphere) and molecular oxygen (Fig. 11). As
Fig. 11 illustrates, the 31.4 GHz channel is more sensitive
than the 23.8 GHz channel to variations in liquid water
path. In fact, for the cloudy sky the 31.4 GHz brightness
temperatures TB2 ﬂuctuate with amplitudes about twice
as large as the amplitudes of the 23.8 GHz brightness
temperatures TB1:

δTB1 ≈

v1 ≈ −2v2.

Inspecting Eq. 10 in the context of Eq. 7, we see that the
contributions of the ﬂuctuations in the two channels to
WVP are approximately equal in magnitude but oppo-
site in sign and lead to a numerical phenomenon known
as catastrophic cancelation (Blum 1972). Therefore, the
small-scale ﬂuctuations in the WVP sequences during
cloudy-sky period appear as noise in the DF A-function
and at high-frequencies in the power spectrum.

During the cloudy-sky period, a comparable problem
does not occur in the LWP retrieval. For the LWP re-
trieval

l1 ≈ −l2/3.5.

(10d)

and the 31.4 GHz channel term in Eq. (6) is dominant,
preventing catastrophic cancellation as in Eq. (7) for the
cloudy-sky period.

The relative magnitudes between the two terms in Eqs.
(6) and (7) and the inﬂuence of instrument noise on them
also explains the dry and moist clear-sky results. For a
cloud-free sky, as the column moisture increases, the ra-
tio of the 23.8 GHz to 31.4 GHz brightness temperature

(Tmr − Tc)/(Tmr − TBν)

(9)

Inspection of the WVP retrieval coeﬃcients in Table 4
shows that

6

increases (e.g., compare Figs. 4 and 8), just the oppo-
site to what happens on a cloudy-sky day with increasing
column liquid (Fig. 11). Consequently, for clear-sky pe-
riods the second term of Eq. (7) becomes increasingly
important.

For clear-sky dry periods (section 4b), the small scale
ﬂuctuations of the 31.4 GHz signal are dominated by in-
strument noise, because the amplitude levels are below
the thershold for sensitivity to vapor at that frequency,
as seen from the microwave radiometer spectrum (Fig.
11). Therefore, the WVP retrieval algorithm expressed
by Eq. (7) becomes noisier.

For a clear-sky moist atmosphere (section 4c) as the
ratio of the 23.8 GHz to 31.4 GHz brightness temperature
is markedly diﬀerent than one, Eq. 10c does not have
such an impact on Eq. (7), the WVP retrieval algorithm,
as for cloudy-sky periods.

The LWP retrieval during clear-sky periods is always
dominated by noise since the second term in Eq. (6) is
always signiﬁcant.

VI. SUMMARY

Time series of both microwave radiometer brightness
temperature measurements at 23.8 and 31.4 GHz and re-
trievals of water vapor and liquid water path from the
brightness temperatures are evaluated using both the
detrended ﬂuctuation analysis method and the spectral
analysis method. We show that the detrended ﬂuctua-
tion analysis method is useful for analyzing the power
law correlations in such atmospheric signals. In particu-
lar, the present analysis demonstrated the validity of the
liquid water path retrieval for a cloudy-sky day and the
water vapor path retrieval for a clear-sky moist day.

We found the water vapor path signal to be dominated
by noise for a cloudy atmosphere on time scales less than
30 min. The appearance of noise-like correlations arises
from the speciﬁc relationships between the coeﬃcients
in the water vapor retrieval equation, the magnitudes of
both the measurements and ﬂuctuations in the brightness
temperature measurements. The latter leads to catas-
trophic cancellation of two terms of a similar amplitude
and opposite sign and is related to the sensitivity of the
measurements to liquid water content at these frequen-
cies.

On both clear-sky days instrument noise is readily ap-
parent in the 31.4 GHz channel measurements owing to
the absence of emission from liquid water.
In the wa-
ter vapor path retrieval noise in the 31.4 GHz channel
measurements blurs correlations present in the vapor-
sensitive channel measurements. For a clear-sky dry at-
mosphere, instrument noise is readily apparent in the
31.4 GHz channel measurements owing to the absence of
liquid water. This noise artiﬁcially blurs the correlations
existing in the vapor-sensitive channel when the WVP
retrieval is performed.

Since November 1996, the DOE ARM program has
been collecting coincident microwave radiometer and
millimeter-wave cloud radar data at its SGP site. We will
use detrended ﬂuctuation analysis and spectral analysis
methods, together with other approaches from statistical
physics, to analyze the temporal properties of boundary
layer clouds that have occurred since November 1996.
The aim of this next step will be to classify boundary
layer clouds according to their statistical properties and
relate these properties to the underlying dynamics of the
cloud ﬁelds. This will lead to better understanding of the
impact of diﬀerent cloud types on the radiation ﬁeld.

FIG. 7. (a) DFA-function < F

for the LWP data illustrated in Fig. 1d is labeled (i). Adding Gaussian white
noise with amplitude of 1/4 and 1/2 of the LWP signal amplitude to the LWP signal results in the DFA-ﬂuctuation function
< F
labeled (ii) and (iii), respectively. (b) The α-exponent for the LWP signal (in Fig. 1d) with added Gaussian white
noise as a function of the noise-to-signal ratio ǫ.The beginning of the abscissa corresponds to the LWP signal without noise
(ǫ = 1). Exponential decay is found to be the best ﬁt, showing that adding noise to a noisy signal produces an incredibly small
eﬀect. (c) Power spectra for the three cases shown in (a), in which the eﬀects of the noise are clearly seen at high frequencies.

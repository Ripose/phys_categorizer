Abstract

Various aspects of modern statistical physics and meteorology can be tied to-

gether. The historical importance of the University of Wroclaw in the ﬁeld of

meteorology is ﬁrst pointed out. Next, some basic diﬀerence about time and

space scales between meteorology and climatology is outlined. The nature

and role of clouds both from a geometric and thermal point of view are re-

called. Recent studies of scaling laws for atmospheric variables are mentioned,

like studies on cirrus ice content, brightness temperature, liquid water path

ﬂuctuations, cloud base height ﬂuctuations, .... Technical time series analysis

approaches based on modern statistical physics considerations are outlined.

limit its content. Much of what is found here can rather be considered to

result from a biased view point or limited understanding of a frustrated new

researcher unsatisﬁed by the present status of the ﬁeld. Yet only to be found is

a set of basic considerations and reﬂections expecting to give lines for various

investigations, in the spirit of modern statistical physics ideas.

The author came into this subject starting from previous work in econo-

physics, when he observed that some ”weather derivatives” were in use, and

some sort of game initiated by the Frankfurt Deutsche B¨orse1 in order to at-

tract customers which could predict the temperature in various cities within a

certain lapse of time, and win some prize thereafter. This subject was similar

to predicting the S&P500 or other ﬁnancial index values at a certain future

time. Whence various techniques which were used in econophysics, like the

detrended ﬂuctuation analysis, the multifractals, the moving average crossing

techniques, etc. could be attempted from scratch.

Beside the weather (temperature) derivatives other eﬀects are of interest.

Much is said and written about e.g. the ozone layer and the Kyoto ”agree-

ment”. The El Ni˜no system is a great challenge to scientists. Since there is

some data available under the form of time series, like the Southern Oscilla-

tion Index, it is of interest to look for trends, coherent structures, periods,

correlations in noise, etc. in order to bring some knowledge, if possible basic

parameters, to this meteorological ﬁeld and expect to import some modern

statistical physics ideas into such climatological phenomena. It appeared that

other data are also available, like those obtained under various experiments,

put into force by various agencies, like the Atlantic Stratocumulus Transi-

tion Experiment (ASTEX) for ocean surfaces or those of the Atmospheric

Radiation Measurement Program2,3 (ARM), among others.

However it appeared that the data is sometimes of rather limited value

because of the lack of precision, or are biased because the raw data is already

2

transformed through models, and arbitrarily averaged (”ﬁltered”) whence

even sometimes lacking the meaning it should contain. Therefore a great

challenge comes through in order to sort out the wheat from the chaﬀ in or-

der to develop meaningful studies. I will mention most of the work to which

I have contributed, being aware that I am failing to acknowledge many more

important reports than those, - for what I truly apologize. There are very in-

teresting lecture notes on the web for basic modules on meteorological training

courses, e.g. one available through ECMWF website4.

In Sect.2, I will brieﬂy comment on the history of meteorology. The notion

of clouds, in Sect. 3, allows for bringing up the geometrical notion of fractals

for meteorology work, thus scaling laws, and modern data analysis techniques.

Simple technical and useful approaches, based on standard statistical physics

techniques and ideas, in particular based on the scaling hypothesis for phase

transitions and percolation theory features will be found in Sect. 4.

II. HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION

From the beginning of times, the earth, sky, weather have been of great

concern. As soon as agriculture, commerce, travelling on land and sea pre-

vailed, men have wished to predict the weather. Later on airborne machines

need atmosphere knowledge and weather predictions for best ﬂying. Nowa-

days there is much money spent on weather predictions for sport activities.

It is known how the knowledge of weather (temperature, wind, humidity, ..)

is relevant, (even f undamental !), e.g.

in sailing races or in Formula 1 and

car rally races. Let it be recalled the importance of knowing and predicting

the wind (strength and directions), pressure and temperature at high altitude

for the (recent) no-stop balloon round the world trip. The ﬁrst to draw sea

wind maps was Halley5, an admirer of Breslau administration. That followed

3

the ”classical” isobaths and isoheights (these are geometrical measures !!!) for

sailors needing to go through channels.

I am very pleased to point out that Heinrich Wilhelm Brandes(1777-1834),

Professor of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Breslau was the

ﬁrst5 who had the idea of displaying weather data (temperature, air pressure,

a.s.o.) on geographical maps1. Later von Humboldt (1769-1859) had the idea

to connect points in order to draw isotherms5.

It is well known nowadays

that various algorithms will give various isotherms, starting from the same

temperature data and coordinate table. In fact the maximum or minimum

temperature as deﬁned in meteorology6,7 are far from the ones acceptable

in physics laboratories. Note that displayed isotherms connect data points

which values are obtained at diﬀerent times! No need to say that it seems

essential to concentrate on predicting the uncertainty in forecast models of

weather and climate as emphasized elsewhere8.

III. CLIMATE AND WEATHER. THE ROLE OF CLOUDS

Earth’s climate is clearly determined by complex interactions between

sun, oceans, atmosphere, land and biosphere9,10. The composition of the

atmosphere is particularly important because certain gases, including water

vapor, carbon dioxide, etc., absorb heat radiated from Earth’s surface. As

the atmosphere warms up, it in turn radiates heat back to the surface that

increases the earth’s ”mean surface temperature”.

Much attention has been paid recently11,12 to the importance of the main

components of the atmosphere, in particular clouds13, in the water three forms

1It seems that H.W. Brandes left Breslau to get his Ph.D. thesis in Heidelberg in 1826. Alas it

seems that the original drawings are not available at this time. Where are they?

4

— vapor, liquid and solid, for buﬀering the global temperature against reduced

or increased solar heating14. This leads to eﬀorts to improve not only models

of the earth’s climate but also predictions of climate change15, as understood

over long time intervals, in contrast to shorter time scales for weather forecast.

In fact, with respect to climatology the situation is very complicated because

one does not even know what the evolution equations are. Since controlled

experiments cannot be performed on the climate system, one relies on using

ad hoc models to identify cause-and-eﬀect relationships. Nowadays there

are several climate models belonging to many diﬀerent centers16. Their web

sites not only carry sometimes the model output used to make images but

also provide the source code.

It seems relevant to point out here that the

stochastic resonance idea was proposed to describe climatology evolution17.

It should be remembered that solutions of Navier-Stokes equations force-

fully depend on the initial conditions, and steps of integrations. Therefore a

great precision on the temperature, wind velocity, etc. cannot be expected

and the solution(s) are only looking like a mess after a few numerical steps18.

The Monte Carlo technique suggests to introduce successively a set of initial

conditions, perform the integration of the diﬀerential equations and make an

average thereafter18. It is hereby time to mention Lorenz’s19 work who sim-

pliﬁed Navier-Stokes equations searching for some predictiability. However,

predicting the outcome of such a set of equations with complex nonlinear

interactions taking place in an open system is a diﬃcult task20.

The turbulent character in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is one

of its most important features. Turbulence can be caused by a variety of pro-

cesses, like thermal convection, or mechanically generated by wind shear, or

following interactions inﬂuenced by the rotation of the Earth21,22. This com-

plexity of physical processes and interactions between them create a variety of

atmospheric formations. In particular, in a cloudy ABL the radiative ﬂuxes

5

produce local sources of heating or cooling within the mixed-layer and there-

fore can greatly inﬂuence its turbulent structure and dynamics, especially in

the cloud base. Two practical cases, the marine ABL and the continental

ABL have been investigated for their scaling properties23–25

Yet, let it be emphasized that the ﬁrst modern ideas of statistical physics

implemented on cloud studies through fractal geometry are due to Lovejoy

who looked at the perimeter-area relationship of rain and cloud areas26, fractal

dimension of their shape or ground projection. He discovered the statistical

self-similarity of cloud boundaries through area-perimeter analyses of the ge-

ometry of satellites,fractal scaling of the cloud perimeter in the horizontal

plane. He found the fractal dimension Dp ≃ 4/3 over a spectrum of 4 orders

of magnitude in size, for small fair weather cumuli (∼ 1021 km) up to huge

stratus ﬁelds (∼ 103 km). Cloud size distributions have also been studied

from a scaling point of view27–30. Rain has also received much attenion31–37.

IV. MODERN STATISTICAL PHYSICS APPROACHES

Due to the nonlinear physics laws governing the phenomena in the at-

mosphere, the time series of the atmospheric quantities are usually non-

stationary38,39 as revealed by Fourier spectral analysis, - whih is usually the

ﬁrst technique to use. Recently, new techniques have been developed that

can systematically eliminate trends and cycles in the data and thus reveal

intrinsic dynamical properties such as correlations that are very often masked

by nonstationarities,40,41. Whence many studies reveal long-range power-law

correlations in geophysics time series39,42 in particular in meteorology43–50.

Multi-aﬃne properties25,51–59 can also be identiﬁed, using singular spectrum

or/and wavelets.

There are diﬀerent levels of essential interest for sorting out correlations

6

from data, in order to increase the conﬁdence in predictability60. There are

investigations based on long-, medium-, and short-range horizons. The i-

diagram variability (iV D) method allows to sort out some short range corre-

lations. The technique has been used on a liquid water cloud content data set

taken from the Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition Experiment (ASTEX) 92

ﬁeld program61. It has also been shown that the random matrix approach can

be applied to the empirical correlation matrices obtained from the analysis of

the basic atmospheric parameters that characterize the state of atmosphere62.

The principal component analysis technique is a standard technique63 in me-

teorology and climate studies. The Fokker-Planck equation for describing the

liquid water path64 is also of interest. See also some tentative search for power

law correlations in the Southern Oscillation Index ﬂuctuations characterizing

El Ni˜no65. But there are many other works of interest66.

A. Ice in cirrus clouds

In clouds, ice appears in a variety of forms, shapes, depending on the

formation mechanism and the atmospheric conditions22,51,67,68. The cloud in-

ner structure, content, temperature, life time, .. can be studied. In cirrus

clouds, at temperatures colder than about −40◦ C ice crystals form. Because

of the vertical extent, ca. from about 4 to 14 km and higher, and the layered

structure of such clouds one way of obtaining some information about their

properties is mainly by using ground-based remote sensing instruments69–72.

Attention can be focussed50 on correlations in the ﬂuctuations of radar signals

obtained at isodepths of winter and f all cirrus clouds giving (i) the backscat-

tering cross-section, (ii) the Doppler velocity and (iii) the Doppler spectral

width of the ice crystals. They correspond to the physical coeﬃcients used in

Navier Stokes equations to describe ﬂows, i.e. bulk modulus, viscosity, and

7

thermal conductivity.

It was found that power-law time correlations exist

with a crossover between regimes at about 3 to 5 min, but also 1/f behavior,

characterizing the top and the bottom layers and the bulk of the clouds. The

underlying mechanisms for such correlations likely originate in ice nucleation

and crystal growth processes.

B. Stratus clouds

In stratus clouds, long-range power-law correlations45,49 and multi-aﬃne

properties24,25,57 have reported for the liquid water ﬂuctuations, beside the

spectral density73.

Interestingly, stratus cloud data retrieved from the ra-

diance, recorded as brightness temperature,2 at the Southern Great Plains

central facility and operated in the vertically pointing mode74 indicated a

Fourier spectrum, S(f ) ∼ f −β, β exponent equal to 1.56 ± 0.03 pointing to a

nonstationary time series. The detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) method

applied on the stratus cloud brightness microwave recording45,75 indicates the

existence of long-range power-law correlations over a two hour time.

Contrasts in behaviors, depending on seasons can be pointed out. The

DFA analysis of liquid water path data measured in April 1998 gives a scaling

exponent α = 0.34 ± 0.01 holding from 3 to 60 minutes. This scaling range is

shorter than the 150 min scaling range45 for a stratus cloud in January 1998

at the same site. For longer correlation times a crossover to α = 0.50 ± 0.01

is seen up to about 2 h, after which the statistics of the DFA function is not

reliable.

However a change in regime from Gaussian to non-Gaussian ﬂuctuation

regimes has been clearly deﬁned for the cloud structure changes using a ﬁnite

8

size (time) interval window. It has been shown that the DFA exponent turns

from a low value (about 0.3) to 0.5 before the cloud breaks. This indicates

that the stability of the cloud, represented by antipersistent ﬂuctuations is

(for some unknown reason at this level) turning into a system for which the

ﬂuctuations are similar to a pure random walk. The same type of ﬁnding was

observed for the so called Liquid Water Path3.

The value of α ≈ 0.3 can be interpreted as the H1 parameter of the mul-

tifractal analysis of liquid water content24,25,52 and of liquid water path57.

Whence, the appearance of broken clouds and clear sky following a period of

thick stratus can be interpreted as a non equilibrium transition or a sort of

fracture process in more conventional physics. The existence of a crossover

suggests two types of correlated events as in classical fracture processes: nu-

cleation and growth of diluted droplets. Such a marked change in persistence

implies that speciﬁc ﬂuctuation correlation dynamics should be usefully in-

serted as ingredients in ad hoc models.

C. Cloud base height

The variations in the local α-exponent (”multi-aﬃnity”) suggest that the

nature of the correlations change with time, so called intermittency phenom-

ena. The evolution of the time series can be decomposed into successive persis-

tent and anti-persistent sequences. It should be noted that the intermittency

of a signal is related to existence of extreme events, thus a distribution of

events away from a Gaussian distribution, in the evolution of the process that

has generated the data. If the tails of the distribution function follow a power

it is measured in cm−3; ... sometimes in cm !!!

9

law, then the scaling exponent deﬁnes the critical order value after which the

statistical moments of the signal diverge. Therefore it is of interest to probe

the distribution of the ﬂuctuations of a time dependent signal y(t) prior in-

vestigating its intermittency. Much work has been devoted to the cloud base

height54–56, under various ABL conditions, and the LWP57,64. Neither the

distribution of the ﬂuctuations of liquid water path signals nor those of the

cloud base height appear to be Gaussian. The tails of the distribution follow

a power law pointing to ”large events” also occurring in the meteorological

(space and time) framework. This may suggest routes for other models.

D. Sea Surface Temperature

Other time series analysis have been investigated searching for power

law exponents,

like in atmospheric76 or sea surface temperature (SST)

ﬂuctuations77. These are of importance for weighing their impacts on regional

climate, whence ﬁnally to greatly increase predictability of precipitation dur-

ing all seasons. Currently, climate patterns derived from global SST are used

to forecast precipitation.

Recently we have attempted to observe whether the ﬂuctuations in the

Southern Oscillation index (SOI) characterizing El Ni˜no were also prone to a

power law analysis. For the SOI monthly averaged data time interval 1866-

2000, the tails of the cumulative distribution of the ﬂuctuations of SOI signal

it is found that large ﬂuctuations are more likely to occur than the Gaussian

distribution would predict. An antipersistent type of correlations exist for a

time interval ranging from about 4 months to about 6 years. This leads to

favor speciﬁc physical models for El Ni˜no description65.

V. CONCLUSIONS

Modern statistical physics techniques for analyzing atmospheric time se-

ries signals indicate scaling laws (exponents and ranges) for correlations. A

few examples have been given brieﬂy here above, mainly from contributed

papers in which the author has been involved. Work by many other au-

thors have not been included for lack of space. This brief set of comments

is only intended for indicating how meteorology and climate problems can be

tied to scaling laws and inherent time series data analysis techniques. Those

ideas/theories have allowed me to reduce the list of quoted references, though

even like this I might have been unfair. One example can be recalled in this

conclusion to make the point: the stratus clouds break when the molecule

density ﬂuctuations become Gaussian, i.e. when the molecular motion be-

comes Brownian-like. This should lead to better predictability on the cloud

evolution and enormously extend the predictability range in weather forecast

along the lines of nonlinear dynamics78.
